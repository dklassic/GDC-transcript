Hello and welcome to this special edition of the 22nd Annual Independent Games Festival Awards.
As I'm sure you may have noticed, we are not all in San Francisco celebrating together.
Instead, I am in a forest and you all are tuning in from wherever you happen to be in the world right now.
I have plenty that I would love to say, but I understand attention spans are short and I'm sure you all want to get to the awards, so I'll keep this short and sweet.
These are interesting times and as a perpetual optimist, all I can think of is how much I really love our community.
Even when we're faced with extraordinary circumstances, collectively we're always moving in the right direction.
And we're supporting each other in really remarkable ways.
And while I wish that we were all together celebrating the incredible games and teams that will be honored tonight, I am grateful that we have this opportunity to create a virtual celebration and to include so many of you in sharing this experience with us.
So here's to you, the games and teams who received honorable mentions, the people who worked tirelessly to make the IGF happen, and of course, best of luck to all the finalists.
So let's get this crazy experiment started.
Hi, welcome to the IGFs.
I'm Trent Custers from League of Geeks, and we're here at our studio in Melbourne.
We couldn't come together in person this year, but I'm honoured to be your host for the 22nd Annual IGF Awards.
And thanks to our lead sponsor, ID at Xbox, and a whole heap of last minute elbow grease, we'll be doing things a little bit differently.
This year we'll be celebrating the past year's indie achievements like this.
No envelope opening, no tuxedo, just me, you.
and a bunch of sweet awards. ♪♪ -♪♪ -♪♪ Look, 2020's been kind of grim so far.
But let's not forget the heartbreak that was 2019.
And I'm talking specifically that it was a big year for video game breakups.
Bungie left Activision's bosom and is now strutting around with that big single energy.
Reggie, our sweet, sweet Reggie, left Nintendo.
And I mean, Nintendo's gotta be pretty cut up about it.
They're dating a guy literally named Doug Bowser.
They're with Bowser.
Now, no one wants their ex to date a bad guy.
Nintendo's dating the bad guy.
And then of course, there's the messiest, most public breakup of 2019.
Blizzard and Hong Kong.
But these are all AAA woes.
If you're an indie developer, there are more hot singles on the indie dating scene than ever before, and they've all got a shit ton of real weird money.
That's why this IGF, we're launching Indie Daddy Dating.
We've rounded up the hottest, most cashed up daddies, and we've got them here for you tonight.
Our first daddy has always been pretty well off, but they've recently come into a lot of money with their newly formed Children's Entertainment Empire.
Pretty epic.
Your friends won't really approve of them, but the perks are overwhelming and they never ask for their change back.
Our next daddy is smart, trendy, intellectual.
Your shot at everlasting love could be Apple Arcade.
This design Ford hottie will promise you the world, but once they've got you, they might just check out.
Our next daddy is all about performance, strength, power.
with a playful jock vibe.
Meet Xbox.
They got into the dating game late because they were all about hanging with the boys until their 30s.
But they're our only daddy with an Axe deodorant endorsement.
Okay, for our next daddy, let's go a little bit more mysterious.
Flashy car, rich AF, and they know where you live.
It's Google Stadia.
Even though they've told you 40 times what they do, you still don't understand.
Now look, if commitment isn't really your thing, and let's be honest, this is the independent games festival after all, then our next option may be right up your alley.
Devolver, Annapurna and Raw Fury, our indie publishers.
Sure they may sleep on a mattress on the floor.
And yes.
They might even ask you to pick up the check from time to time, but you'll never be tied down again, unless you're into that.
Alright, let's give out some awards.

Now the winner of this award can rest easily knowing that they've appeased our almighty overlords, the gamers.
This is the winner of the IGF Audience Award, chosen by you.
Audience Award, and the winner is A Short Hike.
Oh, wow. I'm.
so honored and excited to receive the audience award.
Thank you to everybody who voted for my weird little hiking game and everybody who helped me get here today and make the game.
I really want to thank my partner, Dawn, who supported me throughout the entire journey and her wisdom and her contributions to the game made it something a lot better and it wouldn't have been the same without her.
I really want to thank.
My friend Andrew who contributed art to the game and spent time with me while I was working on it.
I want to thank Mark for making the amazing soundtrack.

And everyone else who helped contribute to the game and made it what it is today.

So, yes, thank you so much. Thank you everyone and yeah, it's such an honor.
You can't hear good audio, you feel it.
Well, you can obviously hear good audio.
But good audio is a type of glue.
It's a bonding agent that takes all the different elements and pulls them together into one cohesive piece.
This is the past year's greatest achievements in game glue.

Hi, I'm Hannah Nicklin, Studio Lead at Digu de Fabrique.
We are totally delighted to accept this incredible honour.
Mutazione has been held by many people's hands and hearts of minds over the 10 years since creative lead Nils Denneken dreamt up the wonderful world of the game.
And one of the biggest influences during that time has been composer and musician Alessandro Coronas.
Over to you, Alessandro.
Thank you, Hannah, and to everyone at IGF.
Thank you so, so much.
It's a big privilege.
And I want to extend a huge thank you to the whole team.
As we all know, making games is a gigantic team effort.
So this is also for you, pals.
You know who you are.
So thanks again.
It's a big honor and lots of love from Sardinia.
Thanks very much to the IGF Awards and judges for the nominations in this incredible honour and congratulations to all the other winners, nominees and honourable mentions.
These next finalists found innovative ways, not just to tell their stories, but to help you tell yours. This is Excellence in Narrative.

Heaven's Vault Hi, I'm Jon and I'm Joe. Hello!
And we're Inkle. Thank you for this award.
It means a huge amount to us. When we started Heaven's Vault five years ago, it seemed like a really good idea, didn't it?
I mean, yeah, it did seem like a really good idea at the time, until we added that entire ancient language that you could decipher.
It was so hard.
Oh, and that entire narrative that you could play in just about any order.
That made the game really hard to build.
It was so hard.
Anyway, if you played Heaven's Vault, thank you so much.
We really hope you enjoyed it.
We'll be coming to Switch later this year, and we have a new game called Pendragon, which will be out this year too.
So from me and Joe, thanks to Anastasia Wyatt, Laura Dilloway, Pirantra Mythic, Tom Blunden, Sarah Hefford, Lawrence Chapman and Tom Kale.
So that's everyone at Inkle who helped with the project.
You guys were amazing.
Well done.
This is for all of us.
Thank you, amazing Inklers.
Thank you.
Bye.
See you later.
Game design.
We start our own studios so we can design our dream games.
And then when we're too busy, we have to hire game designers.

I'm so inspired by so many games, so many independent games, and I'm really really happy to be here participating with my own work and to to be contributing and helping to move things forward and to be part of it.
Thank you. Thank you so much. I'm so honored.
Excellence in Visual Art. We were actually nominated for this once, but we didn't win.
I guess that's the best thing about hosting these awards remotely, is that I don't have to hand this award to someone else again. Let's take a look at this year's beautiful games.

Hi everyone, my name is Christoph Frey.
I am the game developer of The Space Between and I am speaking to you here from the wonderful city of Linzen, Austria.
I want to thank you for the Nuovo Award and I am honored to represent an award that is dedicated to the very adventurous exploration of what video games can be.
So, thanks again and I hope I'll see you soon in real life.
Bye!
Hello. Due to the circumstances, we can't do this live, so I'm going to do it my preferred way, heavily edited, with an excessive filter. Okay, perfect. Now, all I need to do is introduce the grand prize nominees, but first I want to talk about 2020.
Careening into a new decade here, and it turns out that this year is also a notable anniversary for the IGF.
20 years ago, the grand prize winner here was a tank combat game called Treadmarks by Longbow Digital Arts.
The founder and lead programmer at Longbow was Seamus McNally. Maybe you've seen his name around somewhere.
Shemis was just 21 at the time, but had already made a few games, and in a lot of ways, he was a pioneering indie developer.
For one, Longbow was selling their games online, digitally.
That doesn't sound like a big deal now, but back at the dawn of indie time in 2000, there was no infrastructure and no easy sell without a physical copy.
And Shemis made an effort to share his knowledge with other developers.
about selling games online, but also about technical issues.
Even though he was young, he was already a very good programmer, and I remember how useful his articles on 3D engines and hardware were at the time.
After Treadmarks, Seamus wasn't able to make another game.
He had been fighting Hodgkin's Lymphoma for a few years, and passed away just one week after winning the Grand Prize.
In his brief time, Seamus showed a kindness, an independence, and especially an openness that set the perfect standard for the IGF.
And for me personally, I'm proud to be associated with his name.
He's a great model for indies.
20 years so far, and 20 more coming up.
And now to segue, the Seamus McNally Grand Prize nominees for 2020.

And the winner is...

Thank you so much.
I'm really, really honoured to be selected amongst the amazing games here at IGF.
Uh...
I really want to thank everybody who helped me get here today.
Um...
Firstly, I'd like to thank my partner, Don, who supported me throughout the entire journey.
Um...
She always believed in me and the game, even when I wasn't so sure myself.
And I don't think the game would have been the same without her wisdom and support.
I want to thank Mark, who made the amazing soundtrack for the game.
Andrew, for the art and his friendship as I worked on the game.
I want to thank David, who made the amazing logo.
And my mom, who supported me every step of the way.
and I really just want to thank everybody who played the game and gave me feedback and helped shape it into something better. So thank you so so much. I'm so honored to be selected today. Thank you.
Well, there you have it. That's another IGF's in the bag, folks. That's a wrap.
Thank you to Lucas Pope for giving someone else a chance this year.
Of course, thanks to Kelly Wallach, chairperson of the IGF, all the judges and jurors, our lead sponsor, ID at Xbox, thanks again for supporting the festival and making it everything that it can be.
And speaking of which, I wanted to thank the IGF team who make all of this magic happen behind the scenes.
I also did want to take a moment to say that our hearts go out to all of those affected by the coronavirus.
Be sure to stay safe, people.
We'll be back next year, live in San Francisco, again for another IGF Awards.
Don't you worry about that.
Now it's time to watch the Game Developers Choice Awards, this year hosted by Kim Swift.
We might even get a chance to finally find out what Death Stranding is all about.
Thanks, everyone.
Have a great night.
you Hey everyone! So, how about that coronavirus, eh?
I'm sure you're keenly aware GDC isn't happening this week so that way we can all avoid, you know, disease and pestilence.
Since, obviously it would be super weird for me to be giving the awards in a completely empty auditorium, I was asked to help out with a remote Game Developers Choice Awards because, obviously, you want to tell everyone who won.
So here I am, coming to you live.
Actually, take that back.
This is pre-recorded.
Say hi to the crew.
Hi, guys.
So we are coming to you from sunny Los Angeles, California.
I'm a bit disappointed, however, that I don't get to present on stage this year because I had this whole outfit planned.
It was pretty great.
And I mean, Look at these shoes, these absolutely perfect, exquisite foot torture devices that I will not get to wear.
Anyways, it is what it is, but hey, the advantage is I could be wearing sweatpants right now and you'd have absolutely no idea.
So, welcome to my roof.
Definitely not your typical setting for the awards.
Also, this is my co-host.
This is Sundae.
You'll be seeing her more.
And also, hey, because this is at my house, if you are lucky, you'll get to hear the amazing ice cream truck that rolls around with the broken Lacooka Ratchahorn.
It is just.
Fantastic.
Well, let's get things rolling.
I've been sitting on who's won for a little bit now, and it's killing me to keep it a secret.
So you know what?
Let's head inside, because it's getting a little warm out.
Hey, welcome to the inside of my house.
Fair warning, there's probably going to be parrot noises at some point, so be prepared for that.
Oh, hi, Sunny.
Anyways, these folks are the future of our industry.
Brand new developers making exceptional content, showing us new facets of what games can be.
Compelling storytelling, colorful artwork, and groundbreaking points of view.
Here are your nominees for Best Debut.

Thanks again.
Bye!
I'm not gonna lie, this right here is my absolute favorite category.
So I learned about a word, which I'm likely going to butcher saying out loud, hypnagogia, which is that point in time, right before you completely fall asleep.
It's called threshold consciousness.
It's like you can hallucinate and have lucid dreams.
And I really feel like innovation and true creativity in games is like manufactured hypnagogia.
We create dream states for our players that they get to control.
And hey, that's pretty damn cool.
Here are your nominees for innovation.
Innovation Award.
Untitled Goose Game, developed by House House, published by Panic.
Disco Elysium, developed by Zaun.

And the winner is...
Baba Is You.
Hello everyone, this is Arvi Teikari.
Thank you so much for awarding Baba is You in the innovation category.
I'm super grateful for that.
I'd like to thank three people.
Anni Leskela for all the encouragement and support over the years.
Niklas Nygren for teaching me a lot about motivation and how to keep working on a project even when I'm not feeling like it.
And Lukas Meller for helping me so much over the years and teaching me many things and many ways to make the things I do better.
Thank you and thanks to the GDC staff for organizing all of this and all their hard work and take care.
Thank you.
Once upon a time, I went to nerd school, DigPen, to get a CS degree.
I got about halfway through the degree and realized that not only do I not particularly like programming, I'm like, eh, okay at it.
But I buckled down, quit playing EverQuest, very, very key, and graduated.
If I took one thing away from the experience, however, was the sheer appreciation of how difficult and complicated it is to build the technologies that allow us as designers and artists to bring our visions to life.
So let's take the time to appreciate the NOMs for best technology.

Big shout out to our in-house engine and tools team, Northlight, and of course a massive thank you to everyone who actually worked on Control, who showed the tech off in the best possible light, made the game play, look and sound amazing.
Thank you so much.
It's time to announce the award for Best Narrative.
First though, I had a very serious request from a friend of mine.
We need to talk.
Up for this category, we have both Outer Wilds, and Outer Worlds.
At what point in time do you think both teams found out about the other game's name?
And were like, oh shit, that's unfortunate.
Luckily for both of them, they are excellent, along with the rest of the nominees in this category.
Here are your nominees for Best Narrative.

Thank you guys, bye!
Bye!
If you know Kate, you know Kate's heroes.
Kate loves strength, she loves misfits, and she loves rebels.
She loves them so much that she frequently dresses like them.
Kate's Thor cosplay is some of the most beautiful.
powerful costuming I've seen outside of an actual Hemsworth.
In the 90s, when Microsoft and Ensemble Studios released the first Age of Empires game, it contained a grievous error.
For totally benign reasons, the game misrepresented a crucial point of cultural history, an error that was so egregious that a regional executive of ours was actually put in jail.
We needed a hero. We needed somebody to help us fix our problem.
We needed somebody maybe from Asgard sent to save us from ourselves.
And that's when I got to meet my favorite geographer, Kate Edwards.
Kate is a rare being, a leader introvert. As a kid, Kate would frequently look up from wandering the playground in a reverie to notice other children following her.
And she would demand, why? Why are you following me around?
But to me, the answer is obvious.
Kate is never lost.
Born into a loving and supportive family, her parents established a morality based on doing the right thing, defending the little guy, and taking action where possible that forms the basis of Kate's worldview today.
At Microsoft, Kate led the entire company in the establishment of a set of processes for geopolitical reviews and standards that is the basis for our friendly global relationships and authentic cultural representation today.
And yes, Kate did help us get our executive out of jail.
As director of the IGDA, Kate broadened both her global worldview and also her understanding of the games industry.
She also gained fame for her outspoken opinions on the imbalances and the injustices that threaten independent game developers even today.
She formed a kind of Dumbledore's army of advocates.
focusing on topics ranging from crunch to diversity to safety from online hate mobs.
Kate expanded the reach of the IGDA to emerging game development regions like Bangladesh, Tunisia, Egypt, and many others.
And her advocacy hasn't ended in the years post-IGDA.
Last year alone, Kate traveled to more than 25 countries, and she spent more than 76 hours on stage or in panels inspiring game developers everywhere.
Her global focus is what makes her so perfect for the Executive Director of the Global Game Jam.
Although she has confided in me, she believes it's time to expand Global Game Jam's horizons.
Somewhere in a galaxy far, far away, the Rebels need our help.
I would like to thank GDC and the selection committee and all my fellow game creators around the world for this tremendous honor of receiving the Ambassador Award this year.
I was honestly taken by surprise by this and so I don't know what to say other than I'm truly humbled and I'm very thankful so, you know, thank you so much for this recognition.
It means a tremendous amount to me.
As we cannot be together this year because of the postponement of GDC, obviously because we're all aware of global events at the moment, I am glad that we can at least connect via the stream.
As game creators and as people who live in a digital world, we have the ability to maintain this connection no matter what.
So we are very resilient in that way.
And so as I'm standing here in Hoth, in actual Finnsund, Norway, where they filmed the Empire Strikes Back over 40 years ago, I wanted to share just a few quick thoughts to you about what this award means to me and what it means to the industry.
You know, when we talk about being an ambassador and what that means, you know, it's about putting our best self forward and trying to present the industry in the best light and to make change happen for the better.
And, you know, what does it really mean to make change?
I think for a lot of us, you know, we find that challenging today because we don't really know where to start.
And I think in my own experience, where it really starts is with ourselves.
If we can.
figure out what is stopping us from taking that step to help somebody or to take that step forward or to be a voice for someone who's marginalized. You know we have to find the confidence in ourselves to get over our imposter syndrome and get to that point where we have that confidence.
You know whether you actually believe in that confidence or not, it's more about believing in the reason to have that confidence which is for other people.
And I know in my experience, that's what's really been driving me.
I mean, I have been driven for a long time now by this notion that evil triumphs when good people do nothing.
And I really believe that. And so that's what has been driving my action in this industry.
Because I want people to be better and I want the industry to be better.
And I want us to treat each other with more respect and to treat each other with fairness and being inclusive in how we approach everything.
You know, at one point, John F. Kennedy, the former U.S. President, said, if not us, then who? And if not now, then when? And really, I think that's something that all of us need to challenge ourselves with. When we see something that we don't like, when we see something that we are dissatisfied with in this industry, and it could be a huge issue that affects all of us, or it could be a tiny thing that affects your local community, you have to ask yourself, Why is it not changing?
And then how can you be that agent of change to make it happen?
And you know, in my experience, and I think what people have seen, at least in my actions, is that basically I made a decision that I'm gonna be the one to step forward and actually try and make change happen.
It's not because I'm better than anybody.
It's not because I have more experience than anybody.
It's just, it's a simple act of will.
And it's actually a decision saying, I want this to change for the better because I think it's gonna help all of us.
And so, you know, as you think about this, and again, I just I'm so thankful for this award.
And for for this kind of honor, you know, just think about for yourselves, what does it mean to be an ambassador for this industry. And so I'm just going to leave you with that challenge. And, you know, I know that if all of us are doing our part, and are trying as best as we can to be that that voice for the industry and for other people.
who are marginalized, you know, this industry and this and this world frankly is going to get better but it's going to take all of us to take that step. So once again thank you so much for this award and I just am deeply appreciative and I hope to see you at GDC next time.
Audio teams are the unsung heroes of our industry, always the last ones to get to bring their art to life in a game's pipeline.
And of course, those players that mute the audio and don't wear headphones.
The worst, right?
Audio really makes a game.
Corrective guidance cues, warnings of things to come, and memorable tunes.
How many times have you woken up with a theme song stuck in your head?
Let's give the audio and music on these wonderful games the appreciation they truly deserve.
Here are your nominees for Best Audio.

Filming an award show is hard work. Um, time for snack. What do you say?
I baked muffins for the crew. Um, what do you think? Huh?
All right, well, this next category of folks maybe took sci-fi movies, TV, and books a little too seriously and swore a sacred oath to bring Holodecks and Oasis back to the real world.

When I first started to learn about digital art and creating the pretties for video games, one thing that struck me is just how absolutely ugly and gruesome things started before they became beautiful and took shape.
Weird blobs of brown at the beginning of a piece of concept art, chonky shapes for models, and have you ever seen an unwrapped material for a character's face?
Like, yikes.
It rubs the lotion on its skin, am I right?
Luckily for us tonight, we get to see the gorgeous, exquisite, and glorious end products of these extremely talented artists.

The first time Roberta Williams played Colossal Cave Adventure, she was transfixed.
It was a computer game unlike anything she'd ever played before.
Literary, narrative, fantastical.
She burned through that game, then others, and when she ran out of games altogether, she took matters into her own hands.
She sat down at her kitchen table and designed her own.
It was 1979, and Roberta Williams was 26 years old.
From that initial moment, a truly unconventional legacy would rise.
Born Roberta Lynn Hauer in 1953, the woman who would one day become the queen of adventure games grew up quietly in the suburbs of northern Los Angeles.
That first game became Mystery House.
Her husband, Ken Williams, programmed the game, but she designed it and drew its images, making Mystery House not just the first adventure game with graphics, but one of the earliest examples of a separation between programmer and designer.
In a moment when most people didn't know what personal computers were good for, Roberta and Ken Williams would strike out on their own adventure to press the limits of computing in the name of entertainment.
Together, they founded Sierra Online, a company that needs no introduction in the annals of video game history.
For much of the 1980s and 90s, Sierra was the largest publisher of home entertainment software in the world, and flagship among its titles was Roberta's King's Quest series, a bright and lively collection of eight games spanning nearly 20 years of production and millions of copies sold.
Best remembered today for their surreal mashup of folklore and fable, mythology and legend.
Only in King's Quest could Medusa share a landscape with evil wizards or Pegasus fly over Dracula's castle.
Overriding each of these worlds, however, was a basic narrative.
Find your destiny, find your family, and protect them at all costs.
Counterposed to King's Quest are Roberta's domestic horrors, Mystery House, The Colonel's Bequest, and Phantasmagoria, in which families are trying to kill you and homes are places where you die.
Roberta Williams' oeuvre expresses a narrative expansiveness few other designers have ever endeavored.
So it's 2020, and we're here to acknowledge what Roberta Williams never doubted, that she was a pioneer.
In the years since she left the game industry in 1988, she has been reluctant to embrace industry recognition.
But perhaps it's we who need to give her this reward more than she needs to receive it.
That we're the ones who need to say we remember because too often the industry would rather forget.
Perhaps the legacy of the woman herself does for this industry what her games did nearly 40 years earlier. Let us know that other stories are possible. It is my deepest honor to celebrate Roberta Williams as the recipient of the 2020 IGF and Game Developers Choice Award.
I just want to thank the Game Developers Conference for bestowing on me this year the honor, the incredible honor, for the Pioneer Award for Computer Game Design.
With the help of Ken, my husband, Ken Williams, one of the greatest programmers around, and he still is, he still is programming, he loves it.
With his help and expertise, with our very first Apple II computer.
to provide the means by which we could do this, we were able to design our very first game, Mystery House, back in 1980.
And I did design it on the proverbial kitchen table, big pieces of paper.
I said I would love to have graphics if that was possible, and rather than being a text adventure game.
And he said, oh, that's pretty hard, I don't know.
But let's see, let's look around.
And he found something called a graphics tablet that was just like a piece of acrylic with kind of this magnetic arm, which is one reason why the art and the pictures on Mr. House don't look so good.
It's not so much that I'm a bad artist, which I am, but I'm not that bad.
It's that that was just very primitive to try to draw pictures.
But that's the way we did it.
And people were amazed at the time.
And they were actually pictures on an Apple computer.
I finally did retire in, I believe, 1997, when we sold our company, which was one of the saddest days of my life, and it was very hard for me.
But I did, and Ken and I went into other adventures over the years, mainly we circumnavigated oceans around the world.
But over those years, 17 years, I...
I created probably about 18, 19, 20 games.
And then I also worked with some of our designers at Sierra.
We were so lucky to have some of the best developers, designers, programmers, artists, animators, musicians in the industry.
And I was just so lucky to be able to work with all of the talent that we had.
It was just the highlight of my life, and I'm so happy and so glad that the Game Developers Conference decided to honor me with this very...
I'm humbled actually, I don't even have words. I'm just, I'm on and very happy and very honored to receive this award. And so on behalf of myself, Ken, and all the people that worked with us at Sierra Online, I want to thank you so very much.
The diversity in the design category this year is absolutely amazing to me.
Be a post-apocalyptic mailman, fly spaceships in a time loop, wordsmith your way to success, exact revenge as a shinobi, and be a jerk goose?
Yes, absolutely. Honk honk, my friends.
I'm issuing a challenge in our industry right here and now.
Can we strive to continue to be this diverse in the games that we offer?
I want to live in these worlds.
Without any further ado, here are the nominees for Best Design.
Oh, and that's Mando.

Hello everyone, this is Arvi Teikari.
Thank you so much for awarding BABA is you in the best design category.
I'm extremely grateful for that.
As for thanks, I would firstly like to thank the GDC staff for all their hard work.
I cannot imagine how much it must have taken to turn such a large event into a digital one on such a short notice.
I would also like to thank the same three people regardless of what happens in the ceremony, so if you hear the same names later or if you heard them earlier, then well, my apologies.
Anyway, I'd like to thank Anni Leskela for all the support and encouragement over the years.
I'd like to thank Niklas Nygren for teaching me a lot about motivation and how to work when feeling unmotivated.
And I would like to thank Lukas Meller for teaching me a lot about how to make games and how to do the things I do better.
Thanks to all of you and have a very nice GDCA ceremony.
Thank you.
Please join me in somber remembrance of colleagues and members of our community that we have lost over the last year.
Let's cherish and reflect on their accomplishments and the joy that they have brought to our lives.

You You There comes a time in the show where we all look at ourselves and think, wouldn't it be nice if we had more things to vote on?
After all, what is an award show if not to give out awards, right?
And hey, audience rewards is like, what, now an eight-year tradition?
We're gonna hit that decade soon.
We've actually had some really good ones in the past, too.
Kerbal Space Program, Nair Automata, Beat Saber.
Let's find out who wins this year.
And the winner is...
Sky, Children of the Light.
Alright, we won!
Hey!
Yeah, it's strange that we are not at GDC, but, you know, I'm feeling the energy, and thank you so much for giving us the honor for the GDC Audience Award.
And, you know, Sky has been a seven-year-long development process.
It was not easy, and without, you know, our players' support.
Without your support, we would not start that game company and we would not have been making these very difficult but beautiful games.
And thank you so much to spend your time and to play our game and also just come to GDC to vote for us.
It meant a lot for us and, you know...
Making Sky is difficult, but we feel very happy that you are with us.
And again, we won't let you down.
And see you in Sky!
Thank you!
My friends, your adorable Pepo time has almost come to a close as we have reached the penultimate of awards.
If Sun actually understood what was happening right now, she'd be super excited, because all of the games up for this category are real damn good.
Well, here we go. The last Game of the Year nominees of the decade.

Untitled Goose Game Hello!
If this is being played then that means that we have won best game.
We really never ever expected that our game would resonate with people in the way that it has.
So it's very strange and incredibly nice to receive this award.
We had a lot of help in making this game so we'd like to thank...
our sound designer M Halberstadt, Dan Golding, who did our music, Kalonica, who helped define the look of our game, Sheree Davidson, who helped make our game accessible to as many people as we could.
This game never would have been made without the support of our publisher, Panic.
We would also like to thank Film Victoria for their support, both of our game, but also of the local scene.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Game developers.
Bye-bye.
Well, that's our show. Congratulations to all of our winners. You better properly celebrate tonight.
And I want to give a huge thank you to Sandesh and Simon for taking a chance and inviting me to host this year's awards. Also, let's hear it for the video editors that are cutting together this particular video. And thank you to IMA Fit for being in my house today and filming all of this.
So, finally, I want to thank everyone for being so patient and understanding this unusual process with GDC this year.
I hope everyone has the absolute bestest, most wonderful days, evenings, or whenever you happen to be watching this.
