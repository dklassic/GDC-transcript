Hello, are you all exhausted? No? Okay. Then it's your job to keep me awake because, oh boy, I'm exhausted. I'm also somewhat losing my voice. So I need you to be the loud ones this time.
Well, you know, how many of you have been to my talks before? A few of you.
I'm known for giving these incredibly dense brain blast talks with 150 slides and tons of references and facts and whatever. This is not that talk. Not only because I'm losing my voice, but just because this topic, I agonized over how to give this talk, to be honest. I've rewritten it more than almost any talk I've ever given. And guys, I've been doing this a long time.
It's something that I feel really deeply and passionately about and it's something that I take very, very seriously. This is co-listed with the advocacy track and not just the design track. And it's for a reason. The other thing about this talk though is it isn't entirely going to be about games. Right?
Social is in the title of this talk.
And as soon as we're dealing with people, we aren't necessarily entirely in the realm of just entertaining.
So, here's the thing.
I'm just gonna say it bluntly.
Social spaces aren't just games.
Like from the get-go.
There are a few of you with whom I remember sitting and having discussions.
You're here in the room, it's so good to see you.
Literally now, gosh.
almost 20 years ago having arguments about whether or not we were even making games when we were making the early virtual worlds and the MMOs. You know, when I was making Ultima Online, I would have arguments with people like Eric Zimmerman about this.
I told them bluntly, I'm not sure that's what I do. I'm not sure I make games. I think I design places and worlds and societies and not just games. They just happen to have a lot of games in them. Things that you can stumble across and play. But really, a huge amount of the work was going into simulating things like tailoring and rabbit hunting and running a shop. Not necessarily what we think of as games. I used to say I was making worlds.
virtual worlds. And I really do believe that when you start working in the arena of online social spaces, that's what you're doing. Even though those days are long gone and you know, MMOs are not the new hotness anymore. They have not been in quite a while. But if you are making a social VR space, a social AR space, a lot of people are trying to do, you aren't just making a game, you're designing a society.
When you choose to take up those tools, connectivity, persistence, identity, you are going to design that society either on purpose or by accident.
And sorry to say, I'm seeing a lot of people doing it by accident.
So I'm here to try to persuade you to do it on purpose.
We'll start with the obvious thing. This should be a terrifying responsibility. The problem is we're all blinded by snow crash. There's still people out there. I know we have some folks from Oculus in the audience. There are people in leadership at Oculus saying yes, I dream of building snow crash.
No, snow crash is bullshit.
It's not where we are really headed.
And it's a great book and a really compelling vision, but we need to be aware of what we're actually working with.
The very first time I met Bruce Sterling, a different cyberpunk science fiction writer, I had already been working in online worlds.
I asked him point blank, how did you get virtual reality?
So wrong.
Wasn't really a fair question.
I want to tell you an anecdote that happened while speaking with an extremely powerful and famous executive at a very large blue company whose last name starts with Z and ends with Uckerberg. I was interviewing for a job there.
And I had talked with people all day long and last interviews with him. And He says to me, well, I've heard good things from everybody all day, and everybody's been asking you questions for eight solid hours, so what questions do you have for me?
And I said, well, I'd like to know your opinion.
What do you think are the social and ethical implications of social virtual reality and connected augmented reality?
This was his answer.
I may have ranted at him for a little while and then not gotten the job. But I also would not have taken it at that point. And probably will never work for them again now that I've said that. But that's okay. Let's get real for a minute. We are talking about companies that are trying to create world spanning social VR and AR structures and haven't done basic work on what online communities are. I often say I'm not entirely sure Facebook understands right? Adding you willy nilly to groups. Is anybody a fan of that one? Features like that.
So the idea that people are out there building constructs like this without doing some basic lesson learning is a little bit terrifying to me given the way that society has developed and the amount of power that has ended up in the hands of large internet companies. And it should be a little bit terrifying to you too.
So I promised some lessons. How many of you here are actually working on building social virtual reality experiences? Awesome. How about, how many people are working on like trying to cash in on Pokemon Go and build social AR experiences? A few. Okay, good. So let's get real and look at some specific lessons here before I go all lofty on you.
is, I'm going to call out actually a particular company, but I think their response to this incident was actually really good. So I want to preface that. Do all of you recall the case of the virtual groping in quiver, quiver, VR, whichever? Okay. Good. So a woman logged into this game, which apparently is about doing VR archery, and a stranger named, I think it was big bro some number, walked up and started virtually groping her.
response of the company, they were not logged on at the time.
They did not know about the incident until an article was written.
when they found out, to their credit, they immediately put in a bunch of features so that gropers, bodies could not see one another anymore when they came into close proximity. They expanded what they called the personal bubble. And they added a new gesture that they would like to add to the vocabulary of social VR. One where you can do and create like this exploding blue force field that turns the harasser invisible and prevents them from interacting with you.
And they were very up front, immediately posted a post mortem about what had happened and encouraged everybody, hey, we need to take this stuff seriously.
And major props to them.
But let's be straight about what should have happened.
What should have happened is that the people who were logged on 24-7 monitoring behavior were called by a harassment call, appeared with the wrath of God, turned the asshole into a toad and banned him for life.
Right?
This is actually best practice in online community spaces.
Now, I understand that we have a lot of small companies that don't have the resources to maintain customer support on call 24-7, that don't have all of the tools and the background and the technology to be able to do this.
And I don't care.
Because if you host an online community where people can cause harm to another person, you are on the hook.
And if you can't afford to be on the hook, don't host an online community.
I wish there were a different answer. I don't think there is.
Now, you're the government of that space. You're hosting real people.
You should want to be doing this.
You should understand the idea that...
You may not quite know how.
That's fine.
Let's talk about ways you can do it.
The first thing people need to understand is that you actually need to build all of your moderation structure, all of this, on a due process.
You actually need to institute a rule of law.
That means starting from the very beginning, actually having such a code of law, a code of conduct. You need some kind of code of conduct, end user license agreement, terms of service written in plain English that every player affirmatively signs up to the first time they log in and they swear an oath, I will abide by this. And it needs to be posted everywhere and you need to be reinforcing this as a cultural thing. Every day. Right?
This is kind of what we do in the real world.
And we're not even entirely satisfied with how well it works here, right?
But you don't get to abdicate doing it.
It has enormous benefits, just not only as a cultural thing, but also for clearing up edge cases.
Because you're going to be fighting an awful lot of edge cases.
The most concrete practical thing is a tool that has been in use for, oh gosh, I went asking and the earliest virtual world I could find that was doing it were games on America online and genie.
Anybody who here doesn't know what those are because they're too old.
And that's a concept called the circular buffer.
And this is a very simple thing that if you weren't using voice chat you could all go and implement right now.
unfortunately using voice chat so you're screwed. But simply recording, keeping track of the last minute to five minutes of every single interaction each client sees and storing it.
Discarding the stuff that's five minutes old and always entering the most recent stuff so that when something like this happens and no admin is online.
When they hit the report button, it is attached as impartial evidence that can be adjudicated.
The Quiver story, how do you pronounce that anyway?
Quiver, quiver, anyway.
That story, I absolutely believe the woman.
I absolutely believe that story happened.
There's corroboration and all the rest.
At the same time, believe me, you will have cases where it will turn into.
One says, the other says. If you don't have tools like this, you are literally going to spend your entire monthly profit on the first call. Standing there mediating between two people who are yelling at one another. It is actually cheaper to ban every single user who calls for help. I know, this sounds horrendous. Banning every person who calls for help is cheaper.
than helping them, right? Because they cost so much money to support. So you need to have incontrovertible evidence. I have no idea how small shops are going to do this with voice logs. Worse, I think you need to do more than just voice logs. I think you need to record every single gesture so that when somebody does this, the CS person can replay it back and verify who started the fight.
It's not going to be cheap. But you need to do it. The gesture was a great touch, but banning wasn't mentioned in the article. A key lesson from all kinds of social spaces and virtual worlds is that offenders repeat. The number one player killer in Ultima Online was personally responsible for murdering over 4,000 people.
The people who engage in this behavior do it over and over again. And if your social VR or AR system does not have a persistent account system with persistent identity that players invest into, you're effectively making every player get away scott free. Because all they need to do is create a brand new account every single time they log in.
Actions like this matter more in VR, precisely because VR embodies us and makes us feel like we're really there. Okay? There's a lot of talk about, oh, well, we'll just block, we'll just mute, we'll do a personal bubble. It's wholly inadequate. Okay? Let's take a simple thought experiment. One avatar interpenetrates another avatar in some way that somebody finds uncomfortable. They, you know, they, you know, they, you know, they, you know, they, you know, do something nasty and start dry humping the other avatar. Great. So the personal bubble kicks in and the other avatar can't be seen. In theory that person is now okay, right? It's the same logic as well, I'll just block them on Twitter and everything will be fine. What about the third party who is still watching? You're going to be still just as angry about this incident when you get told about it by the third party, right?
Block and mute have never been adequate enough tools for managing these sorts of problems in online settings.
How many of you have read the original rape in cyberspace article? I should ask that more precisely. How many of you working in social VR and AR have read, have not read the original cyberspace article? Okay. Homework item number one.
This was an article that came out in the village voice in 1993 regarding the first major documented case, because I'm positive there were many, many more. Instance of one avatar raping another one. And actually he raped two in public in the living room in the main house at the main entrance of the entire virtual space. With a knife. As in raped with a knife.
But here's the interesting thing.
He didn't even do it to their actual bodies.
He did it using this technological tool that was available in this game called a puppet.
And the puppet, all it did, this was a text world, all it did was make it look like somebody else was doing something.
The victims were actually just standing there.
And they could mute and block him all they wanted.
but it didn't matter because it looked to everyone else in the room like Mr. Bungle was getting these two poor people to do horrendous things to themselves. In 1993, this became a bit of a cause celebre because people started arguing about whether or not that was really rape. I mean, it's online. That can't be real, can it? We know better now, I hope. Although...
have to see, I think there's plenty of Twitter trolls who probably still think, what's the big deal? Right? But I'm pretty sure that right now somebody is going, you know, it will be awfully cool to do user generated content in social VR and somebody is probably inventing the VR version of that puppet right now. Right?
another fellow virtual world guy going way back has this absolutely wonderful phrase, TTP. We use it as an index with which to measure the success of virtual worlds social design. It stands for time to penis. How long until you find the UGC penis that some player has managed to stick in your game?
Ultima Online, the first one I saw was drawn by dropping fish on the road. It happened on the first day. And of course the most famous incident, I encourage you, go look up the video on YouTube. It's astonishing in a surreal kind of way. This poor woman, Angie Chung, was literally attacked by a flying swarm of thousands of penises that swirled around her in a tornado.
So that isn't entirely on the troll, right? If you run that world, that's on you. It's on you.
Every feature you make should be looked at first as a weapon. And it's a dark way to look at humanity, I know. I've grown so cynical. How will a player abuse someone else with this?
Odds are excellent that you aren't actually evil enough when you playtest.
Otherwise, something like groping somebody, God, that would have come up in the first 15 seconds, right?
You know, it's almost an obvious scenario.
I mean, what could they do with the actual bows and arrows?
We haven't even gotten to that part.
It wasn't long ago that we saw an experienced triple A team miss one of these kind of basic things.
How many of you played The Division?
Right. So here's this MMO shooter on the console with a triple A team and they made all the players collide with all the other players. And then they had a single quest giver sitting in the central lobby. So there were lines running out the door and people would barricade the door to prevent other people from getting quests. Right?
My personal experience with making that mistake was in the alpha for Ultima Online sometime around February to May of 1996, where we allowed people to spawn in the inn.
And then they would walk outside.
And they were collidable, of course.
And people would gladly let them out the door.
But then they would sand in the door and not let anyone in, and in the pursuit of realism, we had made it so you could shoot arrows through the windows.
of the inn. So they would let you out and rush to the windows and shoot you in the back as you walked away. And of course you couldn't get back in to defend yourself. You couldn't see who was in the building. We basically proved all of the fundamental premises of medieval defensive architecture. That was 1996 and a game in 2016 can still make the same mistake because we're not necessarily very good about sharing the history.
Or reading it, rather, because the stories have been told.
We laugh about them.
They're fun, until you're pincushioned with 100 arrows in your back.
This brings us to another issue. Those of you who are building social VR, you are here listening to this talk. Excellent. You are good people. You are not going to do these things. But if you are successful, the people you hire will hire other people who will in fact do things like consider it a perk.
to go over to people's private chat spaces and watch them as they engage in, you know, very private things. The very first guy that I banned and fired as an admin on a text mod was somebody who thought it was the perk of a God to be able to spy on same sex couples who were having cyber sex in their private rooms. You have to hard code in the same sex couples limitations into the architecture of your world. Permission bits, absolute logging of every kind of extra normal command, the ability to grant or revoke any kind of capability granularly per individual and only grant the powers that are specific to the scope of that individual's job.
And you have to do this because in the early days of MMOs we had issues where game masters in Ultima Online were having hot tub parties with players and trading sexual favors for in game items. They needed the ability to spawn those items for their job. Unfortunately we didn't have logging in the hot tubs. Probably fortunately actually. So it was hard to prove that these situations were happening.
thing is odds are near certainty. If your virtual world is successful, your digital objects are going to have real money value. There's no escaping it at this point. It is absolutely hopeless to try. Just assume that anything you create as a digital object has real world value and people will be doing things like sleeping for it, paying for it and stealing it.
Just go in the door assuming that that is part of this field.
Fundamentally, you should not be opening a virtual world unless you think in terms of this kind of legal infrastructure.
The easiest way to think of this is you are the gods of this space, but you're the government of this space.
We have drifted away over time from having in-game admins have even visible avatars in the space.
And the reason is in order to minimize the possibility of personal relationships forming between customer service and individual players.
I miss the days when you could hang out with the players and you were the God and they weren't and all of it and you could hang out and do things for them.
But the reason why we've gone and anonymized everybody is because corruption happens.
You also need to be aware, and this is also just a home truth, the people who use virtual spaces are very often using them for therapeutic purposes.
That means a higher incidence of individuals inside your space who are dealing with psychological stress of various sorts. It's just how the numbers work out.
You just need to be aware of it. There is not a single large scale commercial virtual world that does not have the FBI and suicide hotlines on speed dial. The number of runaways that we tracked down for the FBI and the police while at Sony online was easily in the triple digits.
And I would add to this, by the way, Be prepared to deal with manifestations of mental illness.
Those folks will frequently be calling for assistance within this virtual setting.
And you have gone and built their home away from home, the place that they use to cope, the place that they are using as their support system.
Often the friends that they've made in your space are the ones that literally keep them alive.
You are holding their lives in your hands.
So you have to take it seriously.
You shape this society in really fundamental ways.
Have I scared the shit out of you yet?
I hope so, right?
I hope so.
Don't worry, it won't all be a downer.
I promise.
But the flip side of this power is that you can shape this environment in ways that are amazing.
The original Mudd, Richard Bartle actually designed it as a blow against the British class system.
That is why you can level up and be anyone and anything.
Because he felt like he'd grown up in a very restrictive world where, oh no, you have the wrong accent.
You'll never get a doctorate, right?
That's amazing, that's super cool.
And in fact, a lot of the earliest virtual spaces were safe spaces for safe spaces for queers, safe spaces for the asexuals, safe spaces for people who prefer the idea of having hundreds of little tentacles for genitalia. They were all colors and shapes and sizes and ages. All of those ideas. One of the huge, huge mistakes of social VR is that they're forgetting that the promise is be someone you aren't. Right?
That has always been a fundamental premise of engaging in a virtual world.
Even in the normative modern MMO worlds, cross-gender roleplay is still incredibly common, right?
We all know this.
Identity exploration is one of the fundamental things that alternate realities let us do.
And when you choose a class or a race or whatever in one of these online worlds, like wow, you're effectively almost engaging in a personality test.
People tend to choose archetypes that resonate and relate to how they visualize themselves.
This is why I hate voice chat, because it's one of the many things that is taking these tools away from people.
It extends beyond voice chat, though.
How many of you are short, like me?
All right, short people.
You guys know that you have lower lifetime earnings than tall people, right?
You get less promotions and lower salaries?
Yeah.
So it turns out that halflings and gnomes in fantasy role-playing games are in less XP per hour and level slower.
because we import real world biases into these worlds. Not intentionally, just the fact that we made halflings short results in them earning less XP because people have biases. So as we chase realistic avatars, we should consider whether realism is really a good idea. If those are behaviors and beliefs that we actually want to reinforce or not.
You know, one of the beauties of the early internet and of virtual worlds in particular is that nobody could tell you were a dog.
Only now we can hear you barking on discord, right?
And we know.
So that's an issue.
most obvious of these are tend to be related to gender presentation but race presentation is another one that's really frequently overlooked. I have lost count of the number of social spaces that don't have race as a customization option. That is embarrassing. From the get go you should be thinking about it. It was controversial in star wars galaxies for us to have a breast size slider. Fortunately female players pitched a fit.
when they found out it was controversial. Because it's important. People need to feel like they can be what they want to be. And be who they are. We had to rename it the torso slider though because LucasArts was very touchy about the terminology. Probably the biggest bias that is present in social VR is around empathy, frankly. Um, I don't know if The challenge here is, well there's multiple challenges, but as people enter a space, if they don't have a stake in the space, if they don't have persistent identity in it already, they, it's very easy to behave as a virtual sociopath.
They don't have any community ties whatsoever.
So you have to start creating investment into an identity really early on.
So those of you who are making systems that are drop-in, don't, you have to start doing persistent identity. If you can abandon identity, that's basically a license to do whatever you want and not get stopped. You can't use things like credit cards to block, for example. Average U.S. household I think has 13 credit card numbers. That's an awful lot of shots at harassing somebody without getting caught.
So the real way you have to do it is by causing personal investment in the identity they are creating so that they don't want to lose it.
They don't want to lose the investment they've made.
But the other big thing that you need to do is increase channels for conveying emotional content.
between the avatars, between the players.
And again, this is a place where voice kind of cuts both ways, right?
I mean, there are two classic ways of doing this.
Very simple.
One is gameplay that involves teamwork.
The other one is an emote system.
Simply put, an emote system.
Best practice emote systems.
involve automatically parsing text chat and pulling out the emotional cues that people are already sticking in there, like smileys. You know this because Facebook messenger does it, chat does it, Twitter does it, everything does this now. That's best practice. Giving people manual puppeteering structures like, oh, I have to hit this combination of buttons to smile, results in people not smiling, I'm afraid. Right?
Yes, there's a subset of people who are good at puppeteering. Most people are not. Having the system puppeteer for them off of cues has been shown to be dramatically more effective. Dramatically more effective. I don't know how you're going to do this with voice. Maybe it can be a really cool research project for somebody to start developing technology to do natural language processing and analysis of voice stressors. But I'm not expecting it any time soon.
So good luck, those of you working in that field, because wild voice does convey a significant amount of emotional content.
particularly once you get into fictional social VR spaces of any sort, you can't expect people to be trained actors in knowing how to convey emotion. It's going to be challenging. And if what they need to do is convey real emotion, they will prefer to use Skype where they get all the cues rather than settling for an inferior system. So my actual advice to social VR people bluntly is to sidestep as many of these problems as possible.
don't have large scale worlds with a bunch of strangers interacting with one another in an unsupervised fashion. Because I don't think you have solutions at the current level of technology for some of these problems. You know, maybe Facebook or Google will be solving these for you at some point, but right now they just don't. Stick to small groups, people who mostly already know each other. Make the avatars relatively unrealistic so nobody cares about the fact that the emotional cues are wrong. Play to the strengths.
The strengths of VR today are that VR is clumsy.
Play with that.
I think that is part of why something like Job Simulator is one of the most successful VR experiences we have.
It embraces the limitation.
Here's the thing, for those of you now who, how many of you played Pokemon Go?
I want to say in advance, Pokemon Go is an amazing achievement.
It's phenomenal and brought joy to millions of people.
So I'm now going to shred it to pieces.
All of these issues get dramatically worse once we're talking about social AR.
You know, from the technology side, people are starting to figure out that a lot of people made this mistake.
They thought that the technology of VR headsets would naturally lead into the technology for AR headsets.
And they're wrong.
It's kind of a speed of light thing.
It's just not happening.
They are, if you are talking about social things, they are the same technology in this very particular way.
I want to take you back in time to 2006 when a whole bunch of us got invited to Stanford for an exercise of the Institute for the Future where we engaged in a futurist envisioning project called the metaverse road map.
This was in those days when people thought it was a good idea to have Twitter feeds behind speakers.
I'd love to see the one for this talk right now.
This is what we said virtual worlds would become.
We said there are four kinds. And at that time, almost all of them were virtual worlds.
Which is to say, fictional environments that you connect to through a client of maps of places that aren't real. Where you go run around and do stuff. That box holds Eve and a second life, Habbo Hotel and World of Warcraft. Right?
But we said, you know, if all you do is swap out the data set of those maps, you instead get virtual worlds that are built using the real world.
And you can log into those instead.
And those are called mirror worlds.
And it's a term that's been around for quite a while.
This is also the time when there are a lot of people who are mounting backpacks on their back with computers and then putting a webcam on their head and filming everything that they were doing and having to swap out hard drives about every 20 minutes.
This is called life logging.
And yes, we saw that as being part of virtual world structure as well.
This is the identity piece, the identity component.
And then lastly, and chronologically last as well, is what we called augmented reality, where these things would start to come together.
Where you might have a virtual world or a mirror world both overlaid on top of the real world, and you engage in life logging as one of the ways to interact with it.
Well, all of these are now here.
All of these are now in fact here. And the thing is, even though the operators of all of these different services don't know this really, they are all running against what I would call virtual world servers. Virtual world back ends. It's just that Twitter only bothered to build the chat part. And Waze only bothered to build the moving around part. And Yelp only bothered to build like region markers.
Right? One of the key lessons of virtual worlds, and it's one that actually a lot of virtual players just refuse to accept.
And I think a lot of people who work primarily with headsets refuse to accept. Rendering is by far the least important part of this entire field. Sorry if you're a graphics programmer.
It is easily the part that matters the least. Every single graphical world I have ever seen has offered a plain text client. Why? Because the admins need it to go look at logs. Right? The worlds are on the server, the representation independent. We might have a canonical client, but the representation is not the part that really, really matters.
What matters is the action that's going on on the server, which is where you actually track things like the avatar profiles, their histories, the location of objects, how they interact with one another and what their behaviors are.
So all of those things are actually virtual worlds.
I call this the goggles fallacy because it is distressing, perhaps inevitable, that the current boom in virtual reality is being driven by the hardware.
If you actually go look at what is going on in these various settings, they're all about clients moving on servers.
Interacting with objects on servers.
Sometimes we drive around on those servers by driving around in the real world.
You know, that's Waze and Google Maps.
It's actually every Android phone.
You guys know that, right?
Android phones are, that's part of how Google detects where there's traffic jams.
Your phone's not moving, tells them.
But Yelp and Zillow are all about teleporting around on the virtual side, but not the real side.
But it doesn't matter.
Either way, there's an avatar moving on the virtual side.
So it's the same technology.
You can literally run down the kinds of technological elements required to build a virtual world server. Does it simulate a space? Yes. Check, check, check. Where is the data from? Is it real or fictional? Doesn't matter. Who cares? Could be half and half. Does it track clients?
Are they connected? Doesn't need to be constant on connection. It could be some of the time.
Check, check, check. Are our clients positioned relative to one another spatially? The main difference is that in WoW and Pokemon we actually bother to spawn bots in there.
right? And let you like interact with them in some fashion. That's about it. Of course these days we kind of allow people to spawn geotag markers into Google maps so we're kind of letting people spawn bots there too. I'll say it bluntly, an old school text mud from 1992 is closer to Snow Crash than anything that has been built with goggles. By quite a lot.
A lot of defenders of VR start talking here about how the sense of presence that exists inside of VR is what makes the difference and they're wrong. They're wrong. Telepresence was defined back in the days before we had pictures.
People reported those sensations in pure text environments.
In factually, if I had to rank the level of presence, I would probably put VR first, then the text games, then all the ones that are on monitors.
Because text games actually embody you almost as powerfully as VR does.
And in fact, if you are looking for more specific concrete lessons about how to deal with avatar intersection issues and all the rest, I would be looking at how text mods handled things.
For example, consent systems for paired emotes was a very, very common design trope in text mods.
One that also appears in modern day LARPing.
where you can't just hug somebody or grope somebody, but there is almost a two-factor authentication process that players must go through in order to engage with others.
That stuff popped up in the text worlds first, because in the text worlds, there was no distinction of distance.
Everybody was standing on a pin in each individual text room.
So all it took was one word for them to be interpenetrating with your avatar.
The takeaway from this is, I mean, how many of you have heard crazy stories about Eve or the plague in WoW or any of these things?
You all heard crazy shit like that?
Awesome!
In a post-Pokemon Go world, expect that to start happening in the real world.
right? All of those things will happen in the real world. Because all of these technologies are really just virtual world servers. It is not going to be very long until there is a template ID associated with your washing machine so that when you look at it, you'll be able to pull up the manual. You can do that crudely right now with Google, of course. But we're not very far away from it actually having an individual instance ID.
Like your washing machine.
and it will have its own character sheet that will have its repair history. Because all it needs to do is be an object in that database. In the run time database of our world. That's not far fetched. That's not science fictional. The problem is we never trust the client. What happens when you are the client? Because you are going to be the client. Your phone is anyway. And this is most relevant because of Pokemon Go. Okay?
I'm going to pick on it, I can't help it. I already did a very detailed mathematical breakdown of why it's advancement system was utterly broken. But I did that back in Austin, you can find that on my website, it's called systems designed for retention, if you like graphs, it's full of it. The real question for us in this room is around things like there are no player killer switches in meat space. Right? So if you start designing your social structures in a way that incentivizes players to commit virtual violence against one another, they're probably going to start doing it for real.
All of these things can be quite unintentional. Pokemon Go, I'm sure, absolutely did not intend for its map of spawns to be racist and classist. And yet, it's really, really hard to find Pokemon in poor black neighborhoods and in rural areas. Because its UGC map happened to be built out of kids who were going to Stanford and Berkeley. Right? Technologically advantaged college students.
further. What starts happening, you all heard, oh, Pokemon spawn in the Holocaust museum.
Pokemon spawn in Arlington cemetery. Sure. Right? None of this happened on purpose. I don't ascribe any malicious intent.
But nobody ever means to do this stuff. Nobody ever means to damage somebody's actual equity in their home by accidentally putting Pokémon spawn points or gyms in their privately owned backyard, thereby causing an endless stream of trespassing. And yet, it happened. Right? So we do have to think about these issues.
It might be that someday legislation will appear that goes right alongside well there's water rights and mining rights and air traffic rights and virtual layer annotation rights.
That might actually be the only solution to something like Pokemon spawning in your backyard.
And of course then somebody will license Pokemon rights to a company for money, right?
I struck oil, I struck Pokemon.
But it starts raising questions like can or should a company like Niantic strike a deal with coffee shop A as opposed to coffee shop B, thereby tilting the level of the business balance in that area? There's no rules or regulations around stuff like that. They could direct traffic somewhere it isn't wanted. What if somebody happens to create a really cool social AR game and says, wow, it would be really fun, you know, I'm actually a secret gamer gator, I'm going to start spawning Pokemon on top of a Black Lives Matter rally.
It is trivially easy for an operator of a virtual world to pull a stunt like that.
We've seen the early harbingers of things like that. Anonymous got its start by holding a flash mob in front of a Scientology facility in New York City. We kind of trained people to do this.
All those anonymous kids, we kind of built them, right? We've been training them how to do this stuff.
Phrases like geo tagging mistakenly give us the impression that, oh, we're sticking a little bit of virtual on the real, when what is happening is actually the exact opposite.
We're actually sticking a little bit of real stuff into what is already a primarily virtual environment.
The Harbingers here get real.
We used to say, oh, I even said it earlier, a character choice in an MMO is effectively a personality test.
But so is a collection of your likes on Facebook, because Facebook is really just an extended character sheet.
And sure enough, that's why there's a company called Cambridge Analytica that data-mined that data on 220 million Americans and used it for targeted micro-advertising in order to both suppress votes and encourage people to come out and vote and get us Brexit and Trump.
Because if you run a virtual world, that is the kind of panopticon power you have.
Fake news. Fake news is an instant dungeon. It's an instant dungeon personalized tailored just for you. You get your own spawns and there's Alex Jones is the boss at the bottom of the dungeon. And you get to play lizard people. Right? Because that's the power you have when you're running a virtual space. You all saw the mobs for Pikachu. I have no idea whether it was a conscious decision in that game.
to make it so that each spawn of a Pokemon was instanced.
But if they had not been, if it had been zero-sum, there that day in Central Park around that Santa Monica pier, and there was only one Pikachu to have, I think we would have seen Pika murders by now.
It's human nature. And this sounds like it's crazy, but it is not. I know it because it already happened. In Ultima Online, when we launched first in Hong Kong, the triads joined the game. And they would go and do their player killer war in the game, and then they would take it to the streets. Because by designing our game in such a way that it encouraged tribalism, encouraged othering other players, and then encouraged violence between the groups, we encouraged them to do it everywhere. What happens when the real world is the playing field?
My local gym is a locked church. They've had a lot of problems with people parking in the parking lot at 3 a.m. and getting as close as possible to the stained glass windows to try to catch a signal so they can zap a Pokemon inside. How long until they break in, I don't know. The phones have all of this stuff built in. They do. It's built into the phones, but the phones at least have privacy chips.
The phones have private store houses that even Apple can't break into its own phone. But just yesterday a cloud stuffed toy, I don't even remember the name of it, turned out that they were storing the voice chat logs of all of the kids that ever talked to their plushie on AWS instance on a database that was not passworded. We don't even need the actual user. We don't It's enough to just get enough users to see the perturbations of what's around them. Are we prepared to community manage downtown San Francisco when we have better history tracking of what each individual does than the police or the government do?
You want to manage community for downtown San Francisco? We couldn't even handle a bunch of kids angry about supposed ethics and video game journalism. We're supposed to deal with San Francisco? But those are the tools we're taking up.
It doesn't take away from the achievement of Pokemon Go. It's possible to achieve great things and still open Pandora's box. But we do have these lessons. We do know that these are the things that we can be thinking about. And I realize I'm here at GDC and I'm talking to you about stuff that does not seem very game like at all. But I'm talking with you about it because you're my peeps. You're the ones who will listen. I can't get a, you know, I can't get a Google or anybody to listen to this. If there's anybody from Apple here, call me.
We're going to be playing logged in whether we signed up for it or not is kind of the message I'm trying to give. That's your take away. That's really what this is about. And we usually call entities like that governments. It's not an accident that we talked about governance clear back in the text mods. So yeah, monopolistic giant governments.
There's a little bit more awareness of that since I submitted this talk months ago.
Zak has actually said, oh, maybe this news thing's an issue.
And we do have our first gold farmer in the White House.
Steve Bannon used to run IGE, the gold farming company, and then he turned around and built a gaming website network.
That was his training wheels for running Breitbart.
So some people are paying attention.
When a time comes that new modes and venues exist for communities, and said modes are different enough from the existing ones, that question arises as to the applicability of past custom and law, and when said venues have become a forum for interaction in society for the general public.
regardless of the intent of the creators of said venue.
And at a time when said communities and spaces are rising in popularity and widely exploited for commercial gain, it behooves those involved in said communities and venues to affirm and declare the inalienable rights of the members of said communities.
August 27, 2000.
To my knowledge, exactly three virtual worlds in history have bothered to adopt that Declaration of the Rights of Players.
But the need for it is now greater than ever, and I really wish Pokemon had adopted it.
And I sure hope that those of you who are going back to your companies will seriously consider, oh, please, update it, revise it.
But start thinking in terms of the rights that players should be having in these spaces.
Because soon enough, Internet of Things is going to hit.
This is also not fiction.
I had this conversation with Zuckerberg too.
This is why he bought Oculus.
To turn the world into a unified database of objects.
I'm probably not getting any more consulting gigs there.
Oh well.
We're actively collaborating in this process.
All that's missing is unifying the data.
Facebook owning identity and chat, Amazon the object template database, Google the runtime template database, Apple the client, you know.
We're collaborating in this process and what comes, I don't know.
I honestly don't know.
That's why I'm here.
I need your help.
We need each other's help if we're going to deal with this because this is not hypothetical.
Do not let our world be designed by the people who prefer the lobby of the W to the IGF.
You guys don't go to the lobby of the W, I hope. Right?
Technologists in this room, you guys know how much of this we can build right now. Bluetooth LE beacons, some simple mesh networking. We could build this now. So I wish HoloLens and Magic Leap had that emblazoned on the eyeballs instead of demos because the chip that matters is the networking chip.
Not the graphics chip.
That is what keeps me up at night. I'm sorry, GDC is not supposed to be a downer. If we had all gone to the EGW, I'm sure we would all be leaving here inspired and psyched up. But this is the advocacy track. But I'll say this. This room is the one that gives me hope. How many of you have played a game in the last 24 hours? With a stranger? How many of you feel games, hey, they're for connecting, right?
How many of you feel games, about fairness, supposed to be fair, right?
How many of you think games are for being smart, right?
And that games are for everyone?
Yeah?
Good.
That's what gives me the hope.
Because entertainment has always led the way on this stuff, and that is a pretty good ethos with which to start.
And this is a group that is willing to read giant strategy guides.
So please, go read the work of, you know, read Julian DeBelle, read Nick Yee, read T.L. Taylor, read Thomas Malaby.
Go read all of the endless stuff that has been written about this, because I got to tell you, by the way, virtual worlds are the best documented part of all of video games and the most studied, probably by an order of magnitude.
The stuff is out there.
So, you know, frankly, I'm leaving our collective fate in your hands here.
These are your tools. Now you know what you're actually doing.
Right? It is not what you were not making cute archery simulators. It is not what this was ever about. Now you know better. And that's good. So it shouldn't be too much of a downer. You're the best qualified people on earth to actually build this future. So go out there. Let's have some fun.
Right? Seriously. Let's explore. Have some fun. Just get your homework done first. Thank you. We probably have like some seconds for questions. Five minutes for questions says the glowing yellow sign.
There are microphones here if anybody has any, but you don't because I've persuaded you completely.
That's awesome.
Now, there we go.
Hi, I thought it was really interesting what you said about, essentially, you have the responsibility, and you have some legal responsibility.
You can't go, even if someone wants to open up a taco stand, you have to deal with the health department and all those things. If you run a bed and breakfast, you have to do that. So all these things are not unreasonable.
for people to, you know, devs to take into account. And I guess, you know, dealing with human nature, a turbine, we had to take out the point up emote because, you know, it's a Nazi thing. And, yeah, you don't always expect that at the beginning, but it's, yeah, it's bad stuff. Yeah, so if the questions all turn out to just be MMO veterans coming up and saying, yeah, that, that's fine. Thanks.
By the way, the inventor of TTP. Actually it was Freeman. Oh, really? Jeff Freeman.
There's one thing that I wanted to say just to pile on top of this, which is that over the course of WoW we saw something that's really remarkable, which is something that makes me really sad that people aren't making MMOs anymore, which is that MMOs started as the wild west of gaming and ended up being the single safest genre for women to play in gaming.
because everything else is unmoderated voice chat, whereas MMOs have persistent identity, have persistent community, have the logging, all of the stuff that you talked about, and that's something that we fought.
And Blizzard led the way and made it real.
And you can actually see the gender split of that audience of wow, just go from 2080 to 5050 over the course of a decade.
And I think that's important for us to realize it took a lot of work.
And I have a question, I just wanted to be sure that we all acknowledge that.
Yeah, I think we should.
And it's even more depressing when you realize that the starting point of 2080 was actually already way the hell ahead.
right, because at the time that virtual worlds were starting, the gender split for typical mainstream gaming was more like 95-5.
So virtual worlds were already dramatically more inclusive spaces than gaming was in general.
And now we've made a lot of progress.
And along comes Xbox Live, oh my god, right?
So yeah, there's definitely a lot to learn there, a lot of lessons to take on.
Let's go over to this side.
I think you said for the ideal virtual space, the avatars would be non-realistic and not moving.
Can you elaborate on the not moving, because not moving in VR seems...
Especially with hand controllers, it seems kind of bad.
Not moving very much. I actually mean locomotion, physical locomotion.
So, yeah, VR is really good at...
clumsily moving arms. It's really good at that. It's pretty bad at moving your legs. As we know, right? Most of the locomotion methods involve short hop teleporting and whatnot because of the nausea issues, vestibular, blah, blah, blah.
But the other side of that issue is that, you know, allowing one avatar to move on to another is one of the starting points for these problems. If I were making a social VR thing that I wanted to be a commercial success, I would go clone IMVU.
You sit at opposite sides of a table. You're sitting. You can wave your hands and head all you want. You can build crazy ass avatars, right, because it's all about personal expression and getting to know the other person. It's limited to two people at a time, so if you bail or block, you'll never have to deal with that person again. It just sidesteps all the issues, right? Whereas if you say, no, what I really want to build is wow, only in a VR headset, I go, then you're going to have to build all of the infrastructure that Damien just talked about.
and you can't, frankly.
I'm not sure anybody can, right?
Like I don't, literally do not know a way for people to solve some of those issues with voice chat at current levels of technology.
Will we get there?
Sure, but not today.
So that's really what I meant.
Thanks.
Sure.
I am aged enough to have played MUDs and traditional MMOs for decades.
People tend not to take it very well when they get banned, even in text mods.
So what happens when the form we are projecting into a virtual world is our form?
Are people going to get more addicted to that experience such that we could expect severe reactions from people who would be banned from those worlds?
No, because most people who want to project their real forms aren't going to bother to use virtual worlds to do it.
Virtual worlds convey real forms really, really badly.
Right?
That's not what I mean.
I know what you mean. I think I do.
People will take it more...
You're basically asking will people take banning and punishment more seriously when what they projected is their real self, right?
They put more of themselves physically into it. We're playing a bunch of MMOs. It's a lot of text. Maybe there's chat.
But in virtual reality, you are there.
Yeah, Avatar might not be, you know, might not look like you, but to you, you are in that space.
So what happens when somebody kicks you out of that space?
Yeah, I think there's probably a physical reaction, but in practice, I actually literally do not buy that you are more there in the VR case than you are in the others, right?
The building up of identity is the thing that actually stings, and so it's the loss of that identity is what ends up being really painful.
And CAs are signaling me that we have to go to the overflow questions room.
So really fast, on that, to add to your list, live on the screen.
Yes, Sherry Turkle. If I started listing books and academics we would be here all day. I'll head to, just follow me. We'll find a spot out there. We'll find a spot out there. We'll find
