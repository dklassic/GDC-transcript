Hi, my name is Darina. I am a lead level designer and game economy designer in Room 8 Studio.
As we know, some things require time and strong skill to balance, while others are created already balanced.
The same principle works in creating the in-game economy.
You can create a balanced game, or you can create the game and then balance it.
During my session, I will show you a couple of macroeconomics hands-on methods that can be applied for creating your product.
You are welcome to attend my session on Macroeconomics of a Game Economy on the GDC in San Francisco on March 21st at 5.30 pm.
See you there!
