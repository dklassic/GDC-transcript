Hi, my name is Steven Dickinson and I'm a Senior Technical Animator at The Coalition.
On Gears of War 4, we developed a generalized solution to meet the spatial constraints of an uneven and dynamic environment which was also expanded into our cover, execution, and enemy interaction system.
Are you an animator or programmer looking to reduce animation assets while increasing visual fidelity, coverage, and flexibility?
If so, you should attend my presentation, Motion Warping in Gears of War 4, Doing More With Less.
