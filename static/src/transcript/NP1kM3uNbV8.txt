I'm Kieran O'Sullivan and this is Julian Lalev√©.
Together we'll be talking at GDC 2017 about the character pipeline and customization system of Far Cry Primal.
In our presentation, we'll go through our new character pipeline, where our artists can seamlessly work on characters in both Max and Maya, and we'll explain how we wrote tools that can work in both software packages.
The whole pipeline is integrated with our flexible character customization system named Wolfskin, which we use in Max, Maya, and the game engine to assemble characters from different meshes, material properties, and other inputs, and use rules and solvers to allow advanced interaction between these components and to resolve conflicts.
We hope to see you at GDC 2017.
