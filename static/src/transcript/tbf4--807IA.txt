Always be composing!
The flexible music systems of Plants vs. Zombies Heroes!
Get an in-depth look at the experiments and techniques used to create a highly interactive, vibrant score with over ten different mini hero melodies set side-by-side with brassy combat action cues recorded in a Batman 1960s spy style!
Hear how the score was rearranged for MIDI mid-production, and how the music became more and more interactive, with the help of our middleware, Audio Kinetics Wise, all the way up to the game's release.
Come check out the lecture, Always Be Composing, The Flexible Music Systems of Plants vs. Zombies Heroes.
