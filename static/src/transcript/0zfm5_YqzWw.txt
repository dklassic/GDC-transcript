Hey everybody. Oh, I guess I have my own mic. Perfect. Well, we're going to jump in there.
So here we are, like at GDC, right? It's a week about talking about our favorite games.
But just for like a very quick moment, I want to stop talking about games and instead talk about people, right? Because society has this nasty habit of celebrating the final product instead of the people and their journeys to actually make that final game or that final product, right?
So hopefully you've noticed this recent trend, especially in the game scene, where no matter what kind of team you're on, no matter what size your team is, no matter who you are, people are starting to really prioritize the communities that they surround themselves in.
And today we'll be talking basically on how to build a co-working space, right? After our own bumpy road, and with the hope to both warn you, but also inspire you. So most of these lessons come from GameNest. GameNest is an independent, inclusive co-working space just for indie game developers, right? It's a place for...
It's a place for experienced indies, for motivated students, all different kinds of developers, and again it's those folks who want to surround themselves with people who really understand the challenges of making a game and what that process is like.
It's a co-working space, which means it's pretty much like a shared office.
People bring in their computers, they rent desks, we have a lot of events like an internal feedback Friday or maybe large monthly parties.
It's also important to give context for what GameRest is not.
So it's not sponsored by any...
Also being in San Francisco, it is more focused just for indie game developers. So it's not just a general tech co-working space or incubator or anything like that. It's a co-working space for indies and indie game development.
So for a brief history, we started planning this all in October 2014.
We opened our days on the very first day of January 2015.
And then the people crazy enough to try this was yours truly.
My name's Dylan Jones on the bottom.
That's Jannevin Nordhangen, Jim Fleming, and?
Hey, everybody.
I'm Danielle Swank.
So.
Co-working. There's pretty much five basic steps to starting and running your own co-working space.
And the first thing, and probably the most important thing, is your people.
You really, really have to find a group, because co-working exists in a group.
So, you know, there's this...
Gameness started kind of officially as an idea back in IndieCade at 2014.
And I was in the audience just like you.
And I was listening to this person from Glitch City talk about their space and what they were doing together, and I'm like, oh my goodness, this is the most amazing thing ever.
I want to go and I want to do this.
And these are all my friends and this is them down in LA.
Well, not all of my friends, but you know.
And I got them all together and we all got drunk and we stayed up really late planning what this space might look like.
And I woke up in the morning and I realized I was actually serious about it.
So I got on Craigslist, looked up a couple of spaces, and I sent out an email.
And the next day, Dylan was back in SF looking at spaces.
It was really amazing.
GameDesk isn't just here and isn't just these people.
It wouldn't exist without a larger community.
And so for us, that means meetup groups.
So for the past couple years, both Dylan and I have been running different meetup groups.
Dylan runs one focused on indie developers.
It has about a thousand members.
I run one focused on learning how to make games that has about 800.
And you really, really want to start with this kind of core group of people in order to round out your space.
Because the one thing that you don't want to do is open the doors January 1st and there be nobody in the space and all empty desks.
So that's great.
So you have a bunch of people.
What do you do next, Dylan?
Well, you've got to find the spot to put them where they all are, right?
So you've got to find that home base.
And that's that second step in this process, right?
And as always, when you're starting something new, you're going to be filled with a long list of questions.
And that's okay, right?
That's fine. Don't be afraid to just ask.
That's what we did.
Literally, sometimes we had friends, sometimes we would just cold call or email people, right?
And, you know, if you're thinking of doing that, Or if you're thinking of building a space like this, just shoot us a note.
Shoot other people a note. This is the game industry.
It's filled with a bunch of awesome people that want to help out.
We talked to folks down at Glitch City who told us to go a little bit bigger.
Robin Hunneke over at Phenomena was kind enough to give us some great San Francisco real estate advice.
I used to work out of a closet with some other indies at Double Fine, and they gave us some good culture tips.
Again, so the moral of this slide is...
Just ask. In addition, know where you can compromise. This is always a big one, but consider public transportation so it's easy for folks just to swing by your space. Consider if your building is ADA approved and can you do anything to make it more ADA.
How many square feet do you need?
Keep in mind that when you're talking about square feet, there's a Goldilocks there.
So you might want a big, massive space for events to house all your friends in there.
But you don't want it to feel empty on the day-to-day when people are actually working there.
So where is your sweet spot?
And that'll change.
Does the layout allow you to have enough members to pay your actual bills? And if that's the case, how many bathrooms do you need? All those bizarre little questions like that. And since for us it was just all out of our pocket, price was definitely the biggest one. And please know that the cheaper something is, the more time it will probably take you to fix it up. Like, this is a shot, we almost moved into this funky butcher shop here. It had like a We fell in love with this spot on Valencia.
But if you're used to making games, you're probably not going to say, hey, we should check the zoning laws here first.
That wasn't my first impression of it.
But when we went to the city planning department, which you should totally go to no matter what city you're in, check your property, the city planning department, we realized we could actually get in some trouble for building an office thing and maybe a residential zone.
But eventually, funnily enough, I found this cell phone picture of a computer screen that was showing a Google Maps street view of the outside of this property.
Like, that was the entire profile for this real estate piece of property.
And I said, well, this is either like a classic Craigslist scam, or nobody else has visited this place, and maybe it's the only spot we could afford, and it'll be perfect for us.
It turns out that it was the latter.
So it was a great space, though it needed a ton of work.
But I tell you this story because, I mean, this co-working space is on the very brink of not happening at all, right?
And if you can find, or if we can find a spot in the real estate hell that is San Francisco, I assure you, all of you can go out and find much cooler spots anywhere else.
Keep in mind, though, we made those compromises that I was talking about.
Sometimes we have a line for the bathroom, and you'll have to make compromises, too.
Know where you want to settle on that.
Know what your criteria are.
Know what's specific to you.
Really think about this stuff.
Is it with your group, if you have some founding members with that, do you want a grungy spot?
Do you want a cleaner spot?
How big is it?
Do you want a conference room?
Do you need a kitchen?
Again, how many bathrooms do you need?
To warn you about this process, we'll see if this It is to show you, you can find it online, it's a little flash forward GSC video.
But it is literally us on our hands and on our knees redoing all these floors, literally like construction work.
And thankfully Danielle knew a ton about construction.
But it still took us...
I'm going to show you how to do that.
Hopefully you can check out that video and see it.
It's a fun little video, but what it also does is it also edits out the really hard parts. That's the nice thing about nice little videos. It's this great little montage.
Please know, just like making a game and when you're getting into this stuff, you can do this.
I mean, be prepared for burnout in there, right?
I don't want to be up here and hand out rose-tinted glasses.
There was some incredibly physical and also emotionally hard work in there.
And I mean, you can get, just like a game, kind of stressed out and emotionally burdened at times.
And be prepared for that.
Yeah.
The other thing, other than construction, the other thing that you're going to get really familiar with when running a co-working space is spreadsheets.
It's all about numbers.
And I wanted to show this slide because what stood out to me when I was pulling pictures for this presentation is the time step up at the top.
So that's taken at 10.51 p.m. on a Friday night, and what we're probably doing is pouring over this document.
So this is GameNest startup costs.
We started GameNest with a budget of $24,000, which sounds like a lot of money.
Sounds like, I mean, it's a lot of money to me.
That's $6,000 from each of the four co-founders.
And what you have to know is that landlords don't necessarily like to rent to new businesses.
It's very difficult.
It's not like running an apartment where they just want first and last.
They may want first, last, three months or six months of rent going in.
So with GameNest, we had to give our landlord $16,000 just to get in the door.
That's huge, right?
So we were left with only $8,000 to do everything.
And that's getting chairs for 20 people.
That's getting desks for everybody.
That's paying all our business license fees.
That's getting a router.
And it's all the construction.
So it's painting.
It's ripping up the floors.
That $8,000 goes by so quickly.
Like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
Hi. And so, you know, just know that. Like when you're in the process of doing your build out and you're spending a lot of money, things don't, maybe don't seem like they're that big of a deal. You just want to be careful and aware because otherwise you'll overshoot your budget by a couple thousand dollars. And for me, that's a lot of money. So I just, you know, and you'll make mistakes. Like this is a receipt where we spent $25 on a roll of tape.
You know, it happens. Try not to make it happen on a regular basis. Or maybe things are just surprising. This is one that surprised me. When I was in college, like, mini fridges, I think, are about $100, right? Like, that's about how much I paid. However, the mini fridge that we had to get for GameNest was $400 because it had to be big enough to get everybody's lunches but still small enough to fit under our counter and it just had a bunch of weird requirements. And so our mini fridge.
Cost $400.
The other thing that you're going to really, really want to pay attention to is your local costs and your ongoing operating costs, not just your build out.
So this slide, if you look at that up in the upper right hand corner and that blue box that's highlighted, that's our running cost for the year.
and we did this spreadsheet ahead of time.
And our actual running costs came out to be about within a couple thousand dollars of that price.
That is what it takes to keep GameNest up and running.
And so, you know, that's a number.
And that number is neither good or bad, it's just something that you have to be aware of.
And then once you have a number like that, what you have to start doing...
math and matrix math. So, like, what does that mean? That means there's going to be a sweet spot between how much I charge people and how many people I can get in. And for us in San Francisco, that's $350 for a full-time membership.
The other thing that you want to do is you want to look really carefully at the bottom of the spreadsheet and our projected members number.
So I said earlier that Dylan has a meetup group of a thousand people and that sounds like a lot of people, but there's a huge gulf between people who like the idea of co-working in theory and people who actually give you money to co-work with you.
And so you want to be, when you're doing the numbers, be as negative as possible.
Like, be...
mean. So like our numbers were like 16 of those will show up.
And I had the names of each of those 16 people. And I'm like okay. And in the next month maybe I can convince another four people to join up and then maybe another four after that.
So I would do your budget with that kind of math in mind. For us our break even numbers are 24 full-time people in the space.
And we do that, but those are also really nice and conservative.
The other thing, too, is if you have a lot of members, the quality of the space can start going down because it gets really noisy.
So there's a lot of balancing act that goes on.
The other thing I really want to recommend with running your space is, and helping you with the numbers, is co-working software.
So we use Cobot, and that's a screenshot of it.
And it's wonderful because it automatically builds our members.
So we can take credit cards, which is huge.
I don't have to have a credit card account set up with a bank or anything.
I can just take them.
Because what you don't want to do is you don't want to chase down all your friends every month, or a check, or get in some cash and not keep track of it.
It saves you so much time.
And I want to wrap up with the fact that indie game development is very boom and bust.
I think everybody knows that not always, you know, checks don't come in for a publisher, or we maybe don't make enough, or just things happen.
So we take a security deposit equal to one month's rent.
And that's important because if somebody can't make their rent on the first of the month, what I don't want to do is kick them out on the second. They're my friends. So we just use the security deposit and if their checks come in, if everything works, they can re-op, everything's fine. And if they don't, everybody has a month to get used to the idea that the relationship is changing. So those are the big numbers that I'd recommend.
Yeah, absolutely. And you know, you really need these tools so that you can get back into making your game full-time, right?
Instead of organizing the space full-time. That's vital.
And, you know, the fourth step here is staying true, right? It's staying true to what you set out to build.
We encourage you to make your own pillars, like really decide what you want early on as your small group, write them down, post them up on the wall, save them.
We came up with our pillars as being diversity, community, and great games.
So for diversity, what's the best way to make sure that you're an inclusive environment and keeping it a safe space?
Well, we have basically an application that says, hey, what kind of games have you worked on in the past?
What are you looking to get out of a co-working space?
Do you identify as any traditionally marginalized groups?
And mostly that's for us so that we can get a high level understanding of where we sit so that we know when we need to do further outreach and start getting the word out there more and more. Again, if you have any ideas about this or anything else in between, please come up and say hi. We're always looking forward to hearing that kind of stuff. And for our second pillar is community. And one of the ways that I reflect on our progress that way is basically looking at a series of I'll scroll through some of ours but this is only to get you excited about your own moments that you're going to have when you open your own space. You'll have these nuggets, these little memories that will make it all worth it. I'm a sucker for for nostalgia. But half the reason I post pictures onto the GameNest Twitter is so that we have like an almost scrapbook kind of thing. And I encourage you to actually catalog your fun, right? This is when we hosted Lost Levels. We highly recommend events because it helps get the word out there for new members, new potential members to join you. It also keeps all your current members really engaged, right? It also makes it a destination. And most importantly, it unites your local scene, you know, your local game development scene all under one roof.
and get involved with local ARG artists or real world games.
Help make your space like an actual destination, if that's what you're into, right?
One of my favorite moments was when we had the racket throw this crazy murder mystery extravaganza thing, and I had a friend who actually found out about this event like randomly and showed up.
And I said, whoa, what are you doing here?
And like, honestly, if that doesn't get you excited, that's kind of like as good as it gets when you're running a coworking space.
So, you know, maybe it's the little things, like you just want to get lunch with some friends and talk about the latest games you've been playing.
Maybe it's being able to harbor indies from out of town and they need some internet, right?
Maybe it's having the perfect place to host your favorite game jam.
where it's a giant, giant tutorial room for teaching new developers how to make games, right? And really, where else are you going to find an indie video game themed Halloween, right? Unless you make that space, that awesome may not ever exist, right? You have to go out and build that.
And that was one of the things actually that we really learned.
It was really, you know, once you build it, it's so easy to enable these things.
You know, really all it takes is just encouraging your members to make their own events.
Some of the most successful events we've had are like Game of the Fortnite, which is like imagine a book club but with a video game, so you all play the same thing and then talk about it.
And also these monthly giant out of the shell parties that we have.
So these are just some posters that people make to, you know, get the word out about the space.
And again, also we're having a party on Thursday. You're all totally invited. Check that out online. But, you know, just out of the shell fun parties like that. Again, that third pillar is helping people make great games. And, of course, like that is mostly up to the creator. But when you're in these spaces, right, like you can actually totally help with that. So, I mean, maybe it's pooling together for a booth at GamerX.
Maybe it's just exchanging some information or saying the latest, greatest tips on showing your game at IndieCade.
Or maybe it's all having like, at this case, like a GameNest booth.
Where people at a play-crafting event, you know, could come and be giving you feedback.
It's just easier to organize that stuff.
And you're actually helping make games get better with feedback and everything else in between, right?
And get the word out, of course.
Yeah, so, all right, great. You have this wonderful spot, you've organized a bunch of people, you came up with all your startup costs, and you have all these great engaged members.
Next thing to do is survive. And there's a bunch of unexpected stuff, like IKEA couches don't fit in Honda Civics. Who knew?
But on a more serious note, actually one of the big things that we deal with is security and access to the space.
So there's a couple different ways you can approach those things.
One of the cheapest ways to do it is just to give your members keys.
That presents a lot of problems, though, in that people lose keys, people leave and they don't return them, and all of a sudden there's a bunch of security holes.
And at GameNest, in your co-working space, you will probably be a target.
You're asking your members to leave their valuable, expensive laptops, tablets, all the stuff that game development requires in your space, and other people will want that.
So you just have to be aware of those things.
For us, what we did is we got a 24-hour access card reader.
And that was surprisingly difficult to get.
We had to have somebody come out from a company, and it took them about two months to come and install it, even though we're calling them pretty much every day.
And we're like, I want to pay you money.
And they're like, eh, we don't care.
So just be aware of that.
And every time that we've been broken into, you know, we've had to do more stuff and spend more money on security.
And the other thing that isn't necessarily surprising, but...
is maybe a little bit more of a factor than you might think, is stuff like dishes.
You know?
Like we have a cleaning service that comes in twice a week, and it pays, and it cleans the place, it does all of our kitchen, it does the bathrooms, that's all phenomenal.
But what are those off days?
Like what happens when people like leave dishes in the sink?
You know?
Who cleans those?
It's probably going to be you.
Just saying.
So, be prepared for all that.
You know, or like random stuff that happens in construction.
This is a window that got broken in GameNest and that happened the first day that we moved in and it took us another two months to get it fixed.
You know, just stuff is unexpected.
But it might not even be unexpected due to cost, it might be unexpected due to time.
The other thing that I didn't realize about my co-working space is that all the lights are different sizes.
And they're all different wattages.
And so I'd go to Lowe's and I'd think I'd have all the information I need to buy my stupid light bulbs.
Well, guess what? I had to go back and forth to Lowe's like five times in a day.
It took an entire day's worth of time when I'm trying to get this co-working space up and running to get light bulbs.
And as much as I love my members, sometimes people do stuff that you'd probably prefer them not to do.
So you also have to talk through those things with them.
A good way to do that...
is we have weekly founder meetings where we all touch base with each other, we talk about issues in the space, we get ahead of problems, we also have a slack that everybody in our space is on.
So if things come up and things are issues, we can know about them right away because it's better to deal with stuff proactively.
And then I guess one of the last things that was a positive surprise, there are some I swear, was I underestimated how valuable Gameness would be as an event space.
So we've had companies, and you'll have a great bunch of indies who are excited, and you'll probably have companies reach out to you and be like, hey, can I host a launch party here? Can I do a developer event?
And you should say yes. That is excellent. They paid for my couch.
And you'll find your own surprises too.
And I encourage you to do so.
Definitely.
I definitely undercharge some game corporations sometimes to have fun events there.
So, most of all, it's just go for it.
When we started this, we had no idea how to run an indie game co-working space.
So ask questions.
Again, just go for it.
And seriously, if you have any questions...
Just send us a note, right? Send anybody a note.
Hit us up on Twitter, whatever is best for you.
And most of all, we're definitely looking forward to seeing all these brand new indie game coworking spaces.
So, thank you again, everybody. Seriously. Yeah, cheers.
