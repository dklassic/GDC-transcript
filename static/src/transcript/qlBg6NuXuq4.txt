Hi, my name is Marnas and I'm the AI programmer of Stellaris.
Some of the biggest challenges with the AI in Stellaris is that we have to be able to handle a lot of input data with a lot of dependencies.
We also have to create NPCs with a lot of diversity so that it feels like you're playing against different humans.
So in this talk I will tell you all about how to make your AI moddable, scriptable, how you can expose it to your designers, how you can easily change the content and rebalance the game without using a lot of support from programmers.
and how you can also keep your programmers sane by not having so much stuff being loaded.
Be there or suffer the consequences.
