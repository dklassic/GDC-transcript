My upcoming talk at the GDC Game Narrative Summit is called Force and Fire, making your game more metal. And it's about taking inspiration from heavy metal music, but it's about more than just a particular genre of music. It's about setting your entire game on fire, about soaring on black wings into ever greater heights. Thinking about your game in terms of metal brings it an unfettered energy, a principle of dark rebellion, and along with that Doom-soaked art direction, gothic world-building, and brutal yet elegant game mechanics.
In the beginning is the song, the song spawns the word, and the word forges the world.
