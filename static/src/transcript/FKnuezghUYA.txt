Hi, my name is GÃ©lal Elmansoy, Technical Architect at Ubisoft Montreal.
My talk is Optimizing Servers for the Cloud.
I'm going to be diving into some of the details of optimization we did at Rainbow Six to be able to run on lower demanding machines.
The talk is targeted toward programmers and technical architects.
I'm going to be on the main conference track.
Hope to see you there.
