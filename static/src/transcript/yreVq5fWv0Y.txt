Hi, my name is Conny and I'm the writer, art and creative director of my game studio called Youmai.
We created the story-driven adventure called Sea of Solitude, which I will talk about today.
I will give you a short introduction about my background, so you see how it all influenced Sea of Solitude.
I started my career with 17 at the biggest German comic house in Berlin, drawing for their monthly comic series.
As I had loved video games since I was a child, as soon as the first games academy opened up in Berlin, my chosen hometown, I applied and successfully got an internship.
and became a game designer. I worked mainly as an art director in the games industry up until I founded my own company, Yomai, together with Boris Monza, one of my best friends.
Sea of Solitude is our first multiple platform title.
The first big 3D game we made and the first story-driven game.
We are so proud that we finished it at all with the small 12-people team we had being back then.
Our vision was when humans get too lonely, they turn into monsters.
And first, I want to show you how that looks like.
I'm no child of destiny And no fortune's son I've just chased you so long now I'm too weak to run A new day is here But nothing is new Alone in my room I tremble Today I will talk about the art direction of Sea of Solitude in depth.
I will often use the acronym like SOS.
So just so you know, I don't cry out for help when I say that.
I'm going to talk about how emotions informed and inspired the visual style of the character.
We will cover a lot of ground, looking at how the style of SOS is heavily influenced by emotions, what aspects were important when building our version for Berlin, what makes our Bessel so special, why the monsters look like they do and how limitations inspired features.
So in SOS you play a woman named Kaylee who suffers from such strong loneliness that her inner feelings, that the anger, feeling of hopelessness, worthlessness, turn to the outside and she becomes a monster. On her journey to become human again. She one by one meets her family members who each suffer from different kinds of loneliness and become monsters too. First I want to talk about the general idea that became the base of like everything and influenced every area of art and design. We wanted to make a game where we would start from one emotion and build like everything around it, literally turning the inside, the inner feeling out. K is basically a representation of me and the path I went through to overcome my struggles. I wanted to share my journey in the form of a game. If we look at her, someone spilled ink over the otherwise colorful painting.
Her presence on the screen is a personified void, if you will, representative for the loneliness and hopelessness of her situation.
I can tell you from the feedback we got after the release massive inspiration I drew from real life experience that on one side this approach to develop a game is one of the biggest chances like from personal background then there's the biggest chance to be artistically unique and successful but It's also one of the biggest risks for the development of a game, as you constantly, sometimes like for years, need to deal with this topic.
So drawing your game story from your own life can be very tough.
Seeing Kay every day, being confronted with my personal struggles at work every day.
So basically I always had my baggage with me. Mechanically and artistically I wanted an iconic gadget on Kay's back that represents this feeling of emotional ballast.
which tea isn't processing in a healthy way.
In the game you put manifested struggles or worries in this backpack to clear the environment of it.
As the game progresses, this backpack gets bigger and bigger until it bursts open.
an overwhelming K all at once with the struggles she put in there and causing her to have a nervous breakdown. The backpack also serves as a visual help to spot K even in the darker areas of the painting. My show's narrative perspective was not just literally telling and showing you what happened but putting it all in a metaphorical world so people could make up their own mind, put in their own thoughts and past into sea of solitude. Another cornerstone of SOS is my artistic background as mentioned. I started my career as a comic artist and I'm in general a huge comic fan.
My first big comic love had been the manga Akira.
I especially love the comic style semi-realism.
So not completely realistic but like a mix of the two.
Like for example Akira.
And I tried to put it into Sea of Solitude 2.
So the last cornerstone is my origin.
I was born and grew up in a fishing village, directly on the shore.
My family had been fishermen, are still fishermen.
So swimming, boat driving, the sea guards water are very common for me, it's where I'm from.
Those points, the metaphorical narrative, of my personal story, party, my professional background, and the love for comics, and me growing up directly on the shore, had been the base for all artistic decisions.
Let's start with the environment art.
The story of Solitude plays out in Kay's mind.
That means that what she goes through in real life, we see through her inner eyes.
For the setting, I chose Berlin, the city where I live now for 20 years already.
I tried to make a more romanticized version of Berlin. For example, the Japanese actors portray Germany often, like in Ghibli movies, like Kiki's Delivery Service here as an example.
So we partly took original places from Berlin.
and remodeled it for Sea of Solitude.
One example is the above ground subway station called Bülowstraße.
Here is the in-game version, you see.
And here is the original in-game.
original. We reduced the detail to a minimum necessary to fit our style, but still kept the most prominent details to keep it recognizable. The overboarding feeling Kay has throughout the majority of the game is isolation, and that she is desperate to try and connect with people.
with these basic emotions of her, I decided that the city should look as empty as possible.
Really no sign of life above the water, like even plants are missing. I didn't want to show a post-apocalyptic setting which would have washed out the metaphorical meaning.
So it's a normal, modern, clean city.
It's just empty, as if the people just vanished from one second to the next.
What we did so was putting everywhere on the ground sand to enhance the feeling of an ocean.
So here you can see some signs of disruption in the far corner.
So only the outer circle of the city looks like this.
The further away you get from the center of the mind of Cain and of the city, the houses begin to vanish or crumble down and they begin to sink into the ocean and are crooked and even the streets and trains are damaged.
Throughout the prototyping phase, we encountered an interesting challenge.
Berlin's houses include like rooftops and walls.
They are like problematic for interesting level design compared, for example, to New York City.
We look at it here, like the houses in Berlin have rather like clean design, like nothing beside balconies stick out of the walls, like very much. No ACs or outer fire escapes and we Germans rarely put advertising posters on top of buildings or something.
So all of these things that are often seen on American households are missing in Berlin.
So on top of these design issues, we Germans grew up with...
a ton of American media, be it movies, music, comics. It almost feels like home to us because we are constantly having it in the media, how America looks like and what they are doing.
So it almost feels like home, but it isn't our home. So it took us quite a while to create and explorable gameplay, like explorable architecture that still looks like somehow like Berlin.
So we basically extruded like everything more than it is in reality. Here are like some examples like the flat two-type Berlin house wall.
So if we extruded it, so light and shadow display would be a bit more intense, so that depth, but also most important that the households and the rooftops become explorable pathways. So the constant, I'm sorry for the image here, the constant urge to put in American architecture had been quite big, but we soon saw that even when we accidentally put just one detail like a typical iconic American rooftop water tanks, which you see on the right, and suddenly our complete effort to portray a European city had been destroyed.
So another basic design for me is less is more. To achieve a distinctivity of solitude environment art, I tried to design it with as few details as possible.
But still, every detail needed in there to make the architecture believable.
For me...
To make architecture believable, the most important aspect to get it to feel right is to understand its function and to include the aspects that are needed to put and hold it into the place where it's meant to be. So a tiny example is like the balcony railings. The metal plate that is tied to the wall with the boltings to hold the construction in place is something that I wanted the artist to add, this little thing. While other parts like decoration and aspects could be reduced to a minimum. We applied...
Okay, we applied everything I said to circa to exactly 159 unique buildings.
At least 90 of these buildings were used at least twice or up to four times revisited.
like twice or up to four times within the whole game, which made the design of the city and the polishing so challenging with only one 3D artist beside me, one extra 3D artist and two level designers. So, and I explain now more in detail, we come now to the biggest topic of the whole production, water.
So I love games very much where I constantly roam in the same environment.
So it is more memorable.
Like it starts feeling like home.
Like Resident Evil or Dark Souls or Gone Home.
Like some examples.
So when I did the first level design sketches. I tried to apply what I call the spaghetti level design. So you come back always to the same area again or often to the same area again to different perspectives. In our case the different perspectives are like rising and lowering the water level. So it was a key to that yeah and it also became one of the most unique features.
For the SOS art-wise, but also like gameplay, the water is like the biggest symbol we have in the game.
You're literally walking or swimming through a flooded world.
And this flooded world is like flooded by the main character's tears.
So her very own ocean of tears.
From the very beginning, I wanted to, the water to feel as cozy as possible and clear as if you look into a swimming pool, but even without realistic refraction, so that you sense that it is no real water, but might have a different meaning.
The clearness combined with the spaghetti level design lets you see areas underwater and the water surface that you like later in the game will have access to.
Here are some crappy examples, some examples of the water settings that we could adjust like wave speed or wave height, foam color, foam distortion, foam, the fog underwater, like yeah, regulate everything of this, every of these aspects.
The key design rule I gave to my environment artist was I want the SOS environment to look like a holiday.
destination with many islands and gentle beaches. It took us a while to find the right angle and color of the rooftops so they are really giving you that beach feeling while still looking like rooftops.
Like a lot of rooftops normally are like this in Berlin and we had to find the area that it almost looked like the beach but still like the Berlin rooftops. It was really a challenge but interesting. Those aspects combined like the clear water, the spaghetti level design and the beach feeling of the rooftops are one of the key elements of the distinctive environment art of Sea of Solitude.
I knew we had several heavy topics we talked about in SOS, so I felt like giving the game a light-hearted visual appeal as often as possible was really important and essential.
And that we don't flood the player with negative feelings all the time, from all angles, like everywhere.
So this was really important to me to achieve that light-hearted feeling to compensate for the sappy topics.
We have a strong color palette.
with many different weathers, so we tried to achieve that.
Same as the water height is affected by the emotions of Kay, the weather is also affected by her mood and connected to her mood.
So from very early on, it became clear that the sunny weather that represents the feeling...
of positivity and adventuredness needs to be present as often as possible.
When we made the first roadmap of color schemes based on the emotion Kei is going through in the game, there was way too much darkness. I remember how playtesting made us almost feel like depressed as the sad story and the sad color scheme over a long period was just it was just way too much. So I started to try to give the negative weathers like the rainy weather for example and where the huge underwater creature is lurking a more positive vibe of colors especially for the water. I tried to give the water looks scary. I tried to make it look less scary by making it appear to glow from the depth.
I made the background fork lighter than the fork goes by. And I gave it a bit more purple and blue as it would have initially.
yeah it was important to put it in to help calm the tense feeling.
So in the second level I wanted to portray the heated situation between the parents of Kelly, the boiling suppressed anger of them both, of the parents. It was clear red was the main color of choice here. But same as in the rainy weather, we mixed, we needed to mix some more calming colors such as yellow and brown into the scene. The glowing effect of the water being able to see far and clear what's going on beneath the water surface was important again to fight against the too intense feeling of the story portrayed in that level. It was really important that we added it.
And as you can see in level 2 and 3, the water and the sky are covering much more of the screen, really like drowning the city in the colors because the water level has risen so much in these levels already. So as often as possible we put sunny weather parts into the game.
to let the player relax before we pushed them into like tension again.
So this color scheme of the boyfriend's level had been the easiest to achieve.
Like we show someone who hides his depression behind appearing like totally fine and happy and healthy, showing this whole city of the game and suddenly, suddenly it's sick.
fluffy white snow cover was fitting perfectly to the mood we wanted to transport there.
So this all white and cozy feelings came right before the final level. Our main character finally faced her own issues. We're portraying a breakdown, the absolute feeling of being completely alone and numb.
It was clear I wanted to have it as dark and black as possible.
No colors, dense fog.
So I hope you can see anything here.
In general, we had many issues with our main color, black, in the game.
How dark can you turn the game before it becomes hard to watch or understand where you are?
A huge issue is the many different monitors we needed to adjust the game colors to.
I always wanted to go as dark as possible, but when we tested the game on another PC, it was often like simply pitch black.
We prevented total navigational loss of the player by adding two thick.
One was a subtle light source around K, so the player could always see what is around them.
The second important help was again to make the background fog lighter than the fog close by, so you have the silhouette. With that you can always see like this silhouette of the clearing which functions as landmarks. With those tricks I could finally have my pitch black parts to. So one of the biggest challenges when we created Tea of Solitude had been our manpower. Creating a game of that size with a team of 12 made us come up with a unique design process.
As I mentioned before, I had been not only the art director, but also the brighter main game designer, had with the level design, did the level design schedules, and did the level art with one other level artist beside, and had other responsibilities like the company had.
So in the first years of the concept phase, I just had one program helping me with like Sea of Solitude and we needed to work on other games too that kept the company afloat while we were finding the right approach for Sea of Solitude. So it was like a really just two people team at the beginning, me and one programmer. So I basically just had time to do one key artwork.
for the environment art at the beginning.
So I did it in my favorite 2D tool, like Photoshop, Adobe Photoshop.
I usually work with like many layers in Photoshop and often use like the so-called blending modes for those layers, like multiply, like overlay and transparency.
I use transparency, gradients and masks.
I love using all this for my style.
So when I finished that one key artwork, I walked up to my one programmer and showed him exactly how I made this key artwork in Photoshop and asked him if he can reproduce this immunity as a tool for 3D environment.
so that he creates something in unity that I can work the same way I would work in 2D photoshop.
Because of the tiny team size, we early on decided to not use any textures in the environment. So even like cracks on the wall and the leaves are triangles.
and that had been a huge advantage as we didn't need to unwrap anything or texture, we could scale and squeeze the models freely. We also didn't need to spend time creating textures as mentioned and because of this we could build almost a whole city district, like a real whole city district was just.
one environment artist needs. So to bring life to the untextual environment, I asked my programmer for various tools to help me. Coloring the shadow and ambient occlusion was really important that I could like really color it however I want.
We also misused the specular component of the materials in Unity and used just slightly different colors within this specular gradient.
So when you move through the world of SOS, this effect brings more life into the world without you really noticing it.
It makes SOS look less blunt.
That was a really cool check, I feel.
So, I used the gradient.
in Photoshop create like distance fog and also ground fog like for this concept art I did.
So the specialty in SOS had been that I needed fog over and under water but the fog over water shouldn't affect everything underwater and vice versa. So our programmer Dirk step by step built me a Vasa system tool in Unity, where I could almost use the same workflow I had in Photoshop.
With that...
I didn't need to spend time painting artworks, but I could directly build a one-to-one example for my whole team, where they didn't need to interpret my drawings, but could see like the final product and use that as a blueprint for everything they needed to create and see of Solitude.
So remember, we were only 12 people, we need to iterate fast.
And if you do the same, I advise you to build tools that makes you as flexible as possible.
So that brings me to the second biggest art direction aspect next to the environment art, the monster design. In general, we have two different types of monsters.
in SOS, K's monsters and the monsters of the family of K.
All of them are based on the human behind it, mixed with the biggest emotion they have.
These aspects manifest into their monster form.
When I did the very first sketch of Monsters in Sea of Solitude, I sat down in front of a blank paper and I imagined how I would feel when I'm at the absolute lowest point, like angry and sad.
So I rather scratched over the paper and then drawing anything particular.
and a black ball of lines came out of the session.
So I started to bring this basic idea of how manifested anger and sadness could look like into a human form.
While doing so, the wired lines turned slowly into a feathery fur.
Then I imagined that in order to still go on in life, not giving up, even though you go through all these hardships, you need to still have a flame of hope burning inside you.
So I drew this monster with red, orange light shining from the inside out and through their mouth and through their eyes. This is the base of all monsters you encounter in the game. A black appearance with red shining eyes and mouth.
A short comment before I go deeper into the family monster designs.
The stories about the parents and about the brother are not taken from my life.
I have no brother and my parents are now happily married for over 40 years.
40 years.
So those stories are inspired by colleagues and friends.
The brother monster had been the first family monster I did a concept art of.
The brother gets bullied in school by his former friends and he suffers from harsh self-doubt.
Like unsure for a long time if he is a problem in this whole issue.
So the longer he is in this situation, the stronger his buddhies are harassing him.
The first of the strongest emotions he has is this urge to just want to fly away from this situation.
Like the birds he used to watch through the school windows during lessons.
This is why his monster version appears like a huge bird, in particular a raven mixed with a human body.
He is constantly surrounded by his own weather, which reflects his emotions too.
The second emotion next to the urge to fly away is fear to be seen.
He wants to hide because his buddies start harassing him as soon as they see him.
So I created a thick fog around him, almost colorless, where he hides inside.
His water is special, as it is the only one where you can instantly die.
As mentioned before, the water stands for the ocean of tears, desperation, sadness.
So his emotional state is already so bad that we decided to make his water deadly.
When Kay falls into that water, hands of the Buddhists obstruct, grab her and drown her.
The father of Kay, to leave his wife, as they married rather early in their life and just grew apart.
They tried over many years to fix the marriage, but sometimes it just didn't work out.
And the longer they tried, the unhealthier the whole situation became.
As he, the father, struggles to openly tell his wife what he feels and rather avoid confrontation, he starts hiding from her by working way too much. So I drew his monster version as a big chameleon mixed with a human. I wanted to show with little details like that he is still wearing his wedding ring.
even as a monster that he loves his family.
We encounter him first on the skyscraper where his office is.
I wondered that the building looks almost destroyed.
The father monster and the mother monster fighting for a long while already.
She tried to get him out of the skyscrapers and with this, she destroyed it almost.
Also, I designed the interior of the building, or I had the idea for the design of the interior building as rather empty and cold. Same as the father feels. He sits on top of the building, angrily, angrily crying out.
His screams produce steam streams that comes out of every vent inside the skyscraper and push K, the player, away.
The father monster tries to avoid touching the water, the ocean of tears, like the plaque, as he is unwilling to really deal with his own issues.
He can't even swim.
The mother monster looks like a giant octopus mixed with a female head.
She is about 10 times a lot bigger than the father monster.
I imagined like a loving mother that desperately tries to hold the families, the whole family together, tries to hold onto like everything and keep it from crumbling apart.
So she needed many arms and I immediately thought of an octopus.
The mother monster is often completely underwater and that means that she is constantly worrying and sad but as soon as her daughter or husband shows up she comes out of the water and at least try to appear confident. The mother monster and father monster share a huge weather surrounding them. So we have this dramatic like red and orange colors throughout most of their level. It stands for the end of their partnership but also the heat of tension surrounding them.
The water level is much higher than in the brother's level beforehand as both like the mother and the father suffer from a profound loneliness within their relationship.
that affects the whole family, including their children.
The final argument those two have in the destroyed version of the home in the game, it looks like a bombed crater.
I hope you can see that in the concept.
When the player comes to the home at first, it's still intact.
and it's also the only place next to the end of the game where you see plants and vegetation, plants and vegetation in general. It stands for that Kay feels most healthy there at her home, so she can see the life which she can't throughout most of the game.
So you can see it there.
So the monster, the boyfriend monster, is the most unique one of all family monsters.
Kay's boyfriend suffers from depression, but tries to appear fine to the outside.
He is doing pretty well until he falls in love with Kay and is finally forced to open up about his struggles.
So when we meet the boyfriend monster first, he appears like a shiny white wolf, like white lone wolf.
Throughout the development, the whole development of Sea of Solitude, I educate myself about mental health a lot, but also about metaphors, symbols, and so on.
The lone wolf is a typical symbol for a man that tends to act independently and spend more time alone than in groups.
And it is not only him I portray shiny and white.
In his level, the whole Berlin district where SOS takes place is snowed in.
And he is like really, really good at camouflaging his real feelings.
So he put the whole game under a cozy white snow layer.
So every time he interacts with Kay in the game and she touches him, part of his white perfect camouflage falls off and we see the black dog beneath it, which is a known metaphor for depression. I again designed him part human and part animal.
Kay.
The main character itself, I wanted to portray in a different way.
And as ripped apart into her basic emotions, all of these emotions coming to life.
And she needs to interact with them throughout the entire game.
I took her strongest emotions like self-doubt, joy, self-destruction, hope and willpower.
The playable character represents willpower.
She looks much more like a human than every other monster as she is the closest to recovery.
But of course I wanted to design the main character more human, so the player can project themselves better onto it.
Kay is actually completely naked, which was important to me to portray how vulnerable she is in the state of change and transition to a more healthy life.
The only thing Kay wears is her backpack.
It carries the baggage we all carry throughout our life.
She doesn't know how to cope with all these emotions she's going through.
So the backpack becomes bigger and bigger throughout the game.
until it's like really huge and it bursts and forcing her to finally overcome her own struggles or all deal with all her emotions. Zeddout is the first other monster you meet, uh, you really interact with and meet in the game. Um, all of Kay's monsters are partly her human body. So self-doubt, I choose to mix her with like the human body and with a snail, like especially with a shell. Self-doubt as an emotion always feels to me as it ends up trying to hide somewhere, like it's hiding, self-doubt and you hide.
Mostly, of course, at home.
So a snail shell is in their home.
The self-doubt monster also has teeth like a small child.
I wanted to show that what comes out of the mouth of self-doubt is nothing educated, but rather like blunt or warm.
often true, but so more childlike.
The self-doubt monster shrinks over the course of the game until she turns from self-doubt to healthy doubt.
So first she is house high and super scary.
So at the end of the game, Kay can't even take her in her arms, she's like a baby, that this healthy doubt incites.
Self-destruction is a mixture between Kay and a siren and a shark.
Like she tries to lurk Kay back into the water, into the ocean of tears so she can swallow Kay again.
When I started scribbling her, she was rather soft at the beginning, self-destruction, and a whale, like a whale. But the more her role became clear, like the main antagonist.
and the representation of self-destruction.
She more turned into a super creepy being with this huge sharp teeth.
Okay, so just her torso, yeah, just her torso and her eyes are in front of the head.
and not on the side, reminds us that there is also some human part in it.
If you look really closely, you can see that the feet of Kay's body meld together to form a fin in this monster.
She is always like underwater.
The ocean of tears is her natural habitat.
So self-destruction, same as self-doubt.
shrinks throughout the game so that K can almost lift even self-destruction at the end.
Self-destruction is probably the monster you see the most on the internet.
The way she behaves and the way she swims is something we are very proud of because it needed so much work to get it right and so much attention with complex collision checks to to turn her around like this the snaker animation that gives her like this sine curve style So much work.
So joy Joy, yeah, we put joy in the category of monster Even though she doesn't appear that way at the beginning and is rather special in general. I think of joy as a rather innocent feeling In innocence I connect with her childhood. So I choose to draw joy as a child version of Cain She wears a yellow raincoat So she is completely invulnerable to the ocean of tears.
She even can fly just to be sure that she never touches like the water.
In the boyfriend monster level, Joy finally shows her monstrous side.
She turns into an obsession monster and attacks Kay.
When she tries to get in, when Kay tries to get in the way between Joy and the boyfriend.
Obsession has sharp teeth and I changed the color to purple for readability purposes.
Another entity in the game is a boat of teeth that she drives.
It stands for the hope of K. It also carries the sunny weather with it, like a sphere, which he gets from joy at the beginning. He gets the sunny weather from joy.
It functions as a safe zone. I wanted to design the boat in a robust but simple way, like hope itself. It is not an emotion that is loud or profound.
And I feel it is the most important of them all.
The houseboat is the new version of the family's home.
So underwater, you can see the broken pieces of the family home.
So above the water, it is a new home, a new houseboat that will carry all family members with Kay into the new chapter of life, built from the old life.
So I often get asked what movies like comic books, books or whatever inspired me for Sea of Solitude.
I then always try to come up with art I love, but the truth is that I didn't look at any other art or any other art to get inspired for Sea of Solitude. It came from the inside.
art-wise, like the visual I drew from everything I learned, the visual like everything I learned so far and the style I have developed throughout my life so far. For the story I just let out what I already had in my mind, my feelings. There had been a dangerous situation in between when I looked at other art for once too much.
When the last Guardian, the game, the last Guardian came out, I was so excited about it that I almost studied like this design of Trico, of this huge animal in the game.
At the same time back then I was still designing the monsters of SOS and at some point my co-workers came to me and said like Connie and your monster design looks so different now almost like Trico. It was like a little bit like a shock as I didn't realize this until the moment they told me about it. Like oh gladly I still could revert the damage back then I have done.
So what I learned through the whole production of SOS, be it for the art, the story or every creative process, draw from what is inside you.
Then it will have the biggest chance to be unique.
Adore other's art, but be careful to not adapt it accidentally.
I stopped looking at others art too much at some point and I think this is why the Solitude became a bit more unique. From now on I will always follow the path of first looking inside me, take the strongest emotion or thought I have at the point in my life and use that as a base for the art or the games I want to create.
This way it will likely have the personality, have personality and will be unique.
And I think that is the key we all, all the artists out there, want to achieve. Thank you.
