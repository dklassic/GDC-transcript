Hey folks, my name is Justin Fisher, and like many of you, I'm a huge fan of Dark Souls.
Now, mostly I love it because it's awesome, but I also love it because I think it provides a beautiful template for how strategic business thinking and design can dovetail nicely in a way that benefits publishers, developers, and gamers.
The attributes of Dark Souls give it a true competitive advantage, the kind that corporations in any industry would give anything to have.
And if you can understand the sources of that advantage, you can craft your own.
So if that sounds interesting to you, please come see my GDC 2017 talk entitled Strategic Design or Why Dark Souls is the Ikea of Video Games.
