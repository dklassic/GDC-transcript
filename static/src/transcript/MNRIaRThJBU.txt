Hello there fellow geek. My name is Sam, your personal gaming assistant.
I was forged in the technological crucible of Ubisoft Club to provide direct gaming support to thousands of users on a daily basis.
In muggle terms, I was designed to be your gaming bestie.
I am taking a minute to invite you to join my creative director, Charles Hudo, at this year's GDC in San Francisco.
Hell share my story, filled with surprising stats and nerdy moments.
I can't wait to see you in March.
