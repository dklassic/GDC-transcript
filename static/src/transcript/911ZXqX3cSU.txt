All right, so today's talk for me, designing great UX into your board game pieces, game board and pieces.
So first, who am I?
This is my first board game track to be talking to, so I actually haven't had a chance to meet a lot of you, and a lot of you haven't obviously met me.
I started way back on judge and jury decision making, like how juries would make decisions in cases involving complex scientific testimony like DNA evidence or economic damage models.
I burned out of that and joined a bunch of other grad school, psychology grad school burnouts at Microsoft Game Studios.
And we worked in the usability and play testing labs there.
And we basically studied how groups of people played games and what made the games fun and what made them not fun.
I decided I wanted to build a bunch more games, actually, and learn how they're made.
So I joined up with Big Huge Games.
And as a sort of producer, designer, UX person, shipped a bunch of PC and console games.
Burned out of that, went to Amazon, learned about social computing.
So how do we encourage people to, oh.
No, but, I don't know.
So how do you encourage people to, oh, do you need, oh, stick this in, sorry.
Sorry about that, everyone.
All right, now I gotta figure out how this guy goes.
Okay.
All right, yeah, so went to Amazon, learned things like, how do we convince people to write better reviews or convince people who haven't ever written a review before to write a review or to upload a video of them demonstrating a product?
And then how do we, on the consumer side, help surface that information to purchasers in their buying pipeline so they can make a more informed purchase decision?
Myst Games went to Zyngo where I did more social games that was kind of related a little bit to the stuff I was working on at Amazon and then ended up at Disney Mobile made some mobile games and then for the past five years or So I have been a consultant The things that I do, I study human beings.
I like watching people do things.
I identify user experience issues.
I recommend fixes to teams.
I mentor game designers, PMs, and UXers, and provide some sort of strategy so that we can figure out how to mesh your business and creative goals with your actual user experience, the way people perceive and interact with things.
Why I do it, the top reason is probably the same reason why you all are in it.
We love games, right?
So that's number one.
I love watching people play games.
I might have mentioned that a few times already.
And I love helping people make games.
I'm not the person with the idea for the next great game, but I love helping people achieve their goals.
One thing I don't do is make board games.
I do run an elementary school board game club, and they make games, and I give them little hints or suggestions or whatever, and it's super fun, but I myself don't actually make them.
Maybe I can get some part marks for doing some digital versions of board games.
So Catan is something that I worked on for Xbox Live Arcade, helped out with how do you make the trade interface understandable and fun?
How do you communicate with people across different languages?
Also heavily involved in designing the tutorial and onboarding experience for new players who'd never played before.
Similarly with a Star Wars card battler that existed for maybe a month or two.
Again, player progression, combat, how do you get people into the core loop of the game?
but also the tutorial and onboarding.
And the reason why I'm focusing a bit on the tutorial and onboarding is that it gets, when a lot of my work that I was doing in this area made me think about the ideal way of learning, and it's learning as you play, not learning then playing, right?
Learn as you play.
And this can happen in board games, right?
We all have the friend, or maybe you are the friend, who is very knowledgeable about games, knows all the games, knows all the rules.
Not only knows all the rules, but is really good at teaching the rules and teaching them in the context of actually playing the game.
So it's actually a fun experience to get onboarded to a new game.
But typically, or fairly commonly, right, we're all learning the game together and trying to struggle to figure it out.
And you can see, you know, this is a familiar scene to folks, right, piecing things together.
Someone's scouring through the rule book and hoping that at some point or other you'll get to fun gameplay.
So the board game exercise that I'm going to be talking about today is something I've run on all sorts of different groups.
Elementary school kids, college students, game industry professionals, other UX professionals.
I run them in cities all over the world.
It sounds exciting.
It's not that exciting, except for me, because I like watching people play games.
The basic exercise is this.
The players group up.
I give them a game that they've never played before, and I tell them, go figure out how to play.
You got 20 or 30 minutes.
And I observe players without helping them.
So no manual, and they can ask me questions, but I'm not gonna answer any of them.
After about 20 or 30 minutes, when I see that all the teams have some sort of game going on and they're playing, we break it down.
So the team explains what they came up with based on the board game in pieces.
We diff the version that they came up with with the actual rule set, and then we discuss how the board and the pieces helped or hurt their learning of the game, where it steered them right and where it steered them wrong.
And then we brainstorm fixes together.
So why would I be so cruel?
Why would I bring board games that we all love and put them in front of people who've never played them before and force them to struggle?
As it turns out, as we'll find out at the end, this is a super enjoyable exercise for people, a wide variety of people.
It's fun to play with these essentially toys because they're just pieces and boards.
But my biggest, the reason why I do this, and it's been kind of something that I've talked about for years and years, is.
I believe that game improvement only comes through pain transference.
So we need to take the pain from the player and put it on the shoulders of the developer.
And also, we're designing these days for a world where no one reads.
And so what other tools do we have?
Well, of course, the board and the pieces.
So my background is more traditionally in video games.
And the neat thing about video games is they have board and pieces, but they also have computer feedback, which helps a lot.
When you're playing a board game, the board game doesn't necessarily give you feedback.
actively based on your decisions.
So for Pac-Man, for instance, on the left, the game starts, whether I'm holding the joystick or not, my Pac-Man starts swooping off.
I hear the bloop, bloop, bloop of things being eaten.
I see them disappearing.
I see the score incrementing.
I might notice that there's some interesting blinking things that maybe I should investigate at some point, but whoa, there's this red, angry-looking ghost, and he's coming at me.
I should probably avoid him.
And the other thing I want you to notice about that is the cherry at the bottom right.
This is in terms of progression, right?
So we've set the mode on easy to start with.
So new people coming into the game will have a better chance of surviving for a bit and figuring it out.
If we started on peach or pretzel, new players would just get wiped out before they could even figure out how to play the game.
On the right, you have StarCraft.
You start in a world.
You have a little base.
You've got a bunch of machines going.
They're gathering things.
They're bringing to the base.
You can see the counters on the right.
We're accumulating resources.
Maybe I can use those resources to build things.
You start to see the edge of the map, the fog of war.
It's like, oh, there's more to this.
Maybe I should go out exploring.
And then you look at the mini-map on the bottom left.
And you're like, oh, this is a big world.
And there might be other people who are not my friends out there, and I need to be careful.
And the other thing is, too, talking again about how to make content so that it's easier for people to learn how to play.
Starcraft starts always with the Terrans, the humans.
They're the most human-like and they have a very traditional build structure.
So people can get a sense of the game before they start to introduce them to the more exotic races.
So how does this apply to the board game in context?
So these are three of the games that I use. I use a variety of games I'm going to talk most more about Castle Panic and Cartagena and not about Deus Ex today But yeah, how does this translate?
And as it turns out, like, as most of you know, this is probably the first thing that you all do when you open up a new box, right?
Most people, most of these groups that I ran who'd never played these games before knew to assemble the board in a way that made sense.
They knew to match like things together.
And with this, their sort of intuitive first guesses, they started to figure out like what kind of game this is and how they might begin to play it and maybe what some of the victory conditions are.
The question I have though is how do we go from here where you're sorting the cards, it's all new and exciting, to here where you're actually having fun, enjoying the game, learning the strategy, having your sodas and popcorn.
So from my perspective, when I think about game user experience, the largest job that I tend to do and a lot of us tend to do is what I call removing the suck, right?
There are just a lot of sucky things about figuring out the game, and they're not intentional by the game designers.
But the problem is, is that the designer has the world in their mind, and players have to sort of share that world and be a part of it.
And there are a lot of things that can impede that sharing.
So for instance, like, is this a great initial experience of a game?
Like, I bought a game because I wanted to learn, I wanted to play as a pirate escaping from a medieval dungeon, right?
I didn't want to buy a game to read a whole bunch of rules.
So when I wrote, when I put Cartagena through these groups, here are some of the things that emerged.
The pause, on the positive side, board set up was super intuitive, right?
They have all these pieces, puzzle pieces that fit together nicely.
People figured that out quickly.
Oops.
Ah.
The, yeah, they figured that out.
They figured out that there's some sort of maze aspect to it and you start at one end and where you wanna get is to the boat, because the boat's how you escape, see?
Then you can see one person's holding cards in their hand and they say, okay, we'll deal out some cards, we'll spend some cards to move our pieces around and somehow or other we'll figure out how we draw cards to replenish our hand.
And the victory conditions are, get on the boat.
So a couple things emerged, though, that were troublesome for groups and how they got things wrong when they're figuring out.
The first thing was that the icon flavoring.
So this is one of the, it's a theme that I'm going to talk about a couple more times.
where art and UX can be in conflict.
So the idea is you've got a bunch of pirates you're trying to escape, but they're pirates.
So they see shiny objects on the ground and maybe they pause and take a look and examine it for a second.
And it makes sense.
There's keys to treasure chests, there's gems, there's bottles of rum.
But where people got stuck was on the skull, for instance.
So if you see the skull on the board, they thought if they landed there, maybe they would die, right?
And then if you look at the gun and the knife cards, they thought, well, this game must involve combat because, like, why would we have knife and gun cards if we couldn't attack other pirates, right?
Well, actually, none of that exists in the game, right?
These are just all abstract things that pirates might collect on the way out of the dungeon.
And so it led them to come up with different rules and ways to play the game, some involving combat even.
And they created card battler games out of Cartagena.
And then the core mechanic of drawing cards and playing cards.
They understood that playing cards moved them forward on the board, but they didn't understand, and who could blame them if you haven't played card-taking before, the way that you get new cards is you move your player backwards to the closest occupied space and you get that number of cards.
Not very intuitive, but once you learn it, it makes sense.
So the teams came up with suggestions.
One is, hey, let's just remove the misleading icons.
Why do we need a skull and a gun and a knife?
We can replace them with a crown and a treasure map and a goblet or something like that.
The other thing for the card drawing rules, they already included this arrow card which you had to read the rules to understand why it even existed or how to use it.
Well, replace that with a quick reference card that explain the basic rules of moving forward by spending cards, getting cards by moving backwards.
King of Tokyo was another game that I ran a whole bunch of.
Again, it's a beautiful manual, but what can we figure out without that manual?
So really intuitive, the idea this is a monster brawl game.
The figures are all posed like they want to kill each other.
There's Tokyo, it's on fire, so they're trying to invade Tokyo, obviously.
There's a bunch of dice that look exciting.
They have claws, which are the way you damage people, of course, and hearts, the way you heal yourself.
And, you know, there's monsters, and you win the game by killing all the other monsters, right?
The things that didn't go so well here was, one of the core mechanics is these special cards.
So you see the four energy zombify card.
People intuitively thought that, well, this is here, so we're gonna deal them out to everyone.
Everyone has a handful of cards that we'll play with.
Well, actually, you're supposed to collect, when you roll the dice, you're supposed to collect energy cubes based on the number of energy bolts you roll, and then spend those during your turn to earn those cards.
And so we figured out that it was the disconnect between going from bolt to cube to then bolt again on the card that caused some confusion there, and people didn't necessarily get that.
They knew that you could enter and exit Tokyo and that not everyone could live in Tokyo, but they didn't know the rules for why people would come into Tokyo and why they would have to leave.
And then victory conditions.
They understood when you look at the top card there and you see the 19 beside the star in blue, they understood that went from zero to 20.
They're like, well, zero is probably where you start and 20 is probably where you win, but how do we get those victory points?
And really, we have cryptic clues on the bottom left of the map there where you've got the arrow and one star and then the square brackets and the plus two stars, but they were a little bit cryptic.
Also, there was no way for them to guess that the numbers on the dice actually referred to victory points.
And you needed to get sets of three or more to earn some victory points.
So some of the suggestions we came up with was, well, if you're already kind of torn between, like, you don't want to ruin the art of your game by putting a whole bunch of UX elements on it, right?
You've already made the decision to put some icons and text on there.
Why not just actually make it sort of stand out and clean it up a bit so that people can figure out what's going on?
by looking at it, and it's not quite so cryptic.
And that's the bottom left that I'm referring to there.
Iconography, so for energy, for instance, why not have it always be cubes, right?
So the dice have a cube on it, the card has a cube as the icon, and then you've got these cubes.
That's one way to go about it.
The other way is the aftermarket way.
You can actually buy, I don't know how many of you guys, you all play King of Tokyo, but you can buy the little aftermarket lightning bolts, energy bolts, so that you can have this consistent experience.
And then the victory points, the dice, how do we make it so that the dice indicate that there's a way to get victory points to the dice, maybe coloring them.
We weren't really sure, but some sort of pattern matching or coloring and making that consistent with the color of the victory points.
Castle Panic was next.
So a lot of the positives here, people really quickly picked up and learned a lot about the game just by looking at the board.
They looked at the middle of the board, it said castle.
Okay, we've got a castle, there's monsters who are gonna enter, they're gonna enter from the forest far away from the castle.
Right, that made sense, then monsters are gonna move towards the castle and attack the castle.
They understood that by looking at the cards that they would get, they'd use the cards to combat the monsters and there were certain zones that they could attack based on what card they had.
And the victory conditions, interestingly enough, almost every group that I've played with this ever, knew it was cooperative right from the beginning.
They knew it was the world against them.
A couple of them riffed on some ideas about player versus player, but almost unanimously they knew it was a cooperative experience.
So, the board set up, you can see on the circle here at the bottom right, they have all the walls and the towers on the outside, which is not exactly correct.
You want the walls on the outside and then the towers are kind of the keep in the middle and it's when the keep falls down entirely that that's when the game's over.
The rules of play, so the help text, they had actually help text on the board and in these player cards that everyone could take their little player reference card, but they were vaguely worded, and they were worded more for reminding as opposed to learning.
So they had more vague statements like draw up, well how many cards do I draw, how many cards am I supposed to have?
They had play cards, well how am I supposed to play the cards, am I supposed to use them to attack or do other things?
They had one that's move monsters.
Well, how many do I move?
Do I move all of them, some of them?
Do I, you know, what do I do?
And then another problem that emerged was combat resolution.
So you've got these trolls that look big and they count to one, two, and three, and then you got orcs who are smaller and are one and two.
But you know, what are those numbers really mean?
Are they hit points?
Are they strength?
Is that how much damage they do?
Is it both?
So some of the suggestions that the group came up with were.
First, marking the board.
So again, this is another art versus UX trade-off thing where maybe there's ways that we can elegantly, so that it looks nice, put some silhouettes of where the footprints of the walls versus the key pieces would go.
Decoupling hit points from attacks.
So imagine if we used on the bottom right here, if we used specific icons to indicate damage, the cards dealt those damage to the icons, and then you map those icons onto the pieces.
And then tidying up the help text wording to make it relevant to both, or useful to both players and returning players who might have just forgotten some of the rules.
So adding things like drop to five max cards, move all your monsters.
And finally, Quirkle.
A really neat game, anyone who, I mean, every group always had at least a few people, if not everyone, who'd played Dominoes or Mahjong or something like that.
And so they quickly figured out, you know, okay, we got a tile pile in the middle, we draw them, we make racks, and then we match them together and somehow we win or lose.
That was the problem though.
These pieces are so abstract that there were like an infinite number of ways they could possibly put them together.
And so they spent a lot of time trying to figure out what the rules of this game were.
And that meant that they couldn't really figure out scoring or when the game was supposed to end.
And this was a case where we kind of threw our hands up in the air.
We're like, board and pieces?
Well, there really are only pieces and there's not much we can do with those that won't even make it more confusing potentially.
But we did talk about optimizing the scoring sheet.
You can see on the left, the Quirkle score sheet's pretty generic.
It's just columns of numbers.
It doesn't really have any guidance whatsoever about scoring and how to play the game.
Whereas you can compare that with the rule through the ages one.
You've got both scoring and some rules that are helpful.
So how does this help you?
I mean, none of you, I don't think, are going to come up with the next Cartagena expansion or whatever.
The reason why I'm presenting this stuff is more about to talk about a process that might be useful to you.
And it's a process that supplements your normal play testing.
So you don't use this process for early game development where you're iterating with your core group of designers and trying to figure out what are the fun and interesting strategic things about a game that you want to make.
They're not about balance feedback or about testing for degenerate conditions or golden paths or anything like that.
The idea is to help you think differently about your design decisions, and think hard about the tradeoffs between art and usability, and rely less on the, well, we'll just solve it with the manual kind of mentality, or people will Google it to figure it out.
With the end result being, let's make it easier for people to pick it up and play it, because you can't ship yourself with the game.
So in terms of directing your energies, I consider the gold standard to be, you know, iterating on the board and pieces themselves.
When you fix the issues at the top of the funnel, it means you can make for more efficient use of any kind of additional documentation, right?
If you can clarify a whole bunch of stuff through the actual board, that means you can eliminate maybe sections of the manual and replace it with things that people will, that are known to struggle with.
And so you can prioritize.
what content goes into the manual, and you can actually cut with confidence things that maybe don't need to appear there because you only have limited space.
The late production iteration is more costly than earlier iteration, but there's new tools to make it cheaper, like laser cutters and 3D printers.
This is from Matt Leacock.
It was a paper prototype for a chariot racing game, and he got himself a Kickstarter laser cutter and made himself a fancy little board and everything.
Another vector of attack is, you know, QRCs, scorecards, and help text, right?
Remember when you're designing these, it's for two audiences.
One is for the players who wanna learn how to play the game, but the other is, sometimes it's a party game or something like that.
It comes out only during social events, and you don't maybe play it more than once every few months, and it's a mix of new and experienced players to it.
The reminders are different than the learning how to play, and so make sure you're designing for both and testing for both.
This is also from Matt Leacox here, the role through the ages.
He's got a really cool time lapse video on his website that shows 24 different iterations of this card.
So it's important to keep iterating through these during your play sessions.
The fancy manual, when I worked in video games at the beginning, we actually shipped paper manuals with games, that hasn't happened in years.
But the only things I ever cared about were the center fold, it had to be controller mapping layout, and then the last page had to be the, oh my God, I'm stuck, we need to have the top three things that we know people get stuck on and list them there.
Because my thought was, you're only gonna go to the manual if you're stuck, right?
So we might as well make it easy.
The other thing you can do with the manual is kind of repurpose it a little bit.
I talked a little bit about how you can, when you focus on the UX at the higher levels, it means you can streamline your manual, maybe even cut sections of your manual and replace it with other stuff, like the stuff that people find confusing.
But also, I think it's really useful to consider adding these quick start modes to your game.
I learned, I sort of first learned about this when I was working on Catan for Xbox Live and I discovered that one of the later versions of Catan actually started with the starting map for beginners.
It's a nice balance board, it takes away the early decisions that are overwhelming to users like where do I put my initial settlement and road.
And it makes it so that players start collecting resources right away because it's a balanced board And then so they start building things early trading early and gets them really into the fun parts of it early on And so investing more time into that kind of mode would be great Especially if you can reduce the content you need to include as the traditional manual And then for your digital content, again, this sort of helps you streamline.
Between when my game ships or hits the shelves and now, I might only have time to make one or two videos.
What videos do I make in terms of explaining the game?
Well, you'll have studied.
You'll know what some of the key problems are.
And you'll get a chance to make those videos to supplement that.
I talked a lot about making, you know, finding the sock and eliminating the sock, but one of the other cool things about doing these exercises, and this is what I'm gonna wrap up on, is that actually you get a chance to see people using what you've made in delightful ways that might be totally unexpected.
So in Cartagena, we had some people who experimented with the tiles and said, well, what if an earthquake happened or something happened where we shifted around the tiles partway through the game based on an event?
We had another group who said, well, this isn't a free-for-all game, this is a team game.
And we've got the pirates on the right team and the pirates on the left team racing toward the boat, fighting each other over the boat, and the first team to get on the boat and leave the island win.
Not necessarily what Cartagena was going for, but these are ideas for expansions maybe that you can make or other ideas, maybe you've got some other game ideas you're noodling on, and some of these mechanics might inspire you to try something different.
And the final one is.
Now, I doubt the inventor of Quirkle really wanted to make Jenga out of Quirkle.
But maybe the inventor of Quirkle is like, you know, Jenga's a pretty fun game.
Quirkle, I like.
Maybe there's some new variant of Jenga that I can make up.
And so it gives you new ideas and creative ways to sort of expand what you do.
And I'll end on that.
So we have a few minutes left to take some questions.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Do we want people to come up to the mic?
No, OK, I'll just repeat the question.
So if you can shout it out, or you can feel free to come to the mic.
I was just wondering if there's any common UX pitfalls that you saw amongst all the games you were testing.
That is the million dollar question.
The question's about, are there common pitfalls?
And I think If I could write that book, I would probably be like a millionaire and retired a million times over.
But I think the biggest thing is having this as part of your process.
Because you start to, within your own genre of game and the games that you make, you start to learn the patterns of what happens.
So that's one thing is I can't give you a common answer, but I can say that the process works if you let it work.
But one of the common things is where I talk about this.
Usually it's a creative direction problem where it's like.
We want the game to be immersive, and so we want the art to be beautiful, but also we want the game to be immersive and we want it to be understandable.
And that conflict right there, how much art is too much art and distracts you away from actually learning how to game play.
And as I mentioned during some of those examples, those were some key issues.
It's like the art looked great, but it was unintentionally distracting and not in a good way.
Thank you.
I don't know if this is working.
Oh, yeah.
OK.
So I noticed that you were saying that for the test, at least, you take the rule books out, but leave the quick reference cards in.
Would you say that quick reference cards are superior to rule books?
And if you could simplify it enough, would you say a game would be better if it was just two or three quick reference cards with no rule book at all?
That's an interesting question.
So could we just eliminate the need for manual and have these awesome quick reference cards?
I think that would be great.
I think you're always going to need some sort of manual, especially for, like there are some games that don't lend themselves well.
I picked specifically games that they take an hour to play, they're more partyish games, they're not as deep.
And I think for those types of games, yes, exactly that.
Want to move away from the manual into just like, let's start sorting things out and figuring out how to play from the cards themselves.
So I can't give you like the overall, like I don't, like I'm fighting for a world where we never have to have another, no, I'm not arguing for that at all.
But I think there are definitely classes of games where it's not necessary to have one, or that doesn't have to be the expectation that I need to read the manual before I can learn how to play it.
Hi, I'm Krzysztof from Asmode Poland.
Have you thought while this testing about the some information that you put on a board is language dependent.
And while developing the game, you want to keep some of the components language independent, language neutral.
Have you find any? Do you?
Can you tell us any good thoughts about that that you that you saw while you were exploring this topic?
Yeah, that's a good question.
So about game localization, and obviously it's much cheaper and more streamlined to be able to design a game once and ship it across all languages.
The suggestion that some of the teams made for King of Tokyo, where let's tidy up the wording or some of the cards for Castle Panic.
Yeah, it's a tricky situation when you want to focus on words themselves as a solution.
First of all, just because words can clarify things, but people read the words as Moses from the mountain kind of thing.
If you write something in a way that doesn't exactly make sense, you might actually harm them more than help them.
In terms of localization, though, we didn't see any specific trends.
We just noticed that it's, I think, as a process thing, you'll just want to iterate more on them to make sure that those non-verbal hints are being effective and effectively conveying what you want.
And one thing that we struggle at is that, like on the King of Tokyo board, it's like, those icons were kind of meaningless to people, and they didn't really explain what was going on.
Now, again, that also, you bring that back to the fact that, as a reminder, it works great if I already know the rules, basically, but as a new player to discover them.
And then you just make the trade-off yourself.
You say, well, yeah, we can't localize this across a bunch of languages.
And so we're just going to, just for the sake of the business, we're going to make sure that we just use the icon-only version.
The others.
All right, I think I'm supposed to remind everyone that I guess you'll get an email asking for feedback.
So feedback encouraged.
I love to learn and make my speeches and talks better.
And I'm happy to stick around at the end and talk to people individually.
Thanks very much.
