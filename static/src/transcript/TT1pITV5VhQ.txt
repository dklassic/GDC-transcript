Hi, I'm Sho Iwamoto, audio programmer at Square Enix.
In my GDC lecture, Epic and Interactive Music in Final Fantasy XV, I'd like to show our tools and techniques to make Final Fantasy music interactive.
Horizontal re-sequencing in boss battles, vertical remixing in chocobos, and so on.
Everything we challenge to make them interactive while remaining their epic melodies.
Wait for the music, or sink to the game?
You'll see our approach in this session.
