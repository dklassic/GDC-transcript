Hi, my name is Genevieve, Senior Instructional Designer for Roblox.
At this year's GDC, I'll be talking about the design process of Roblox's Creator Challenge.
It's a self-paced tutorial we launched last year designed to show students that they too can be game developers.
I'll take you through why we created it, some of the design process, what we learned, and how we do our best to ensure that students stay motivated.
So if you want to learn about how we use dinosaurs, exploding volcanoes, wave finding, peak-end theory, and progression curves to attract new developers to our platform, come to my talk!
