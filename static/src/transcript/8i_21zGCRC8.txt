We first started with pre-visualizations in VR space because we wanted to help VR film directors to showcase their story at an early conceptual phase.
But then traditional filmmakers, live-action animation directors would ask us, what about us?
We also needed a tool that would help us to synchronize everybody on set, layout people, production people, actors, to help them to understand where the story goes in each and every moment.
This is how Cardinal came to be.
