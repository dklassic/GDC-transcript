I'm Adam DeGranis, co-founder of mom and pop art shop Chickadee Games and art director of PocketWatch Games' upcoming arcade strategy game Tooth & Tail.
Join me for my session, Fast, Cheap & Flashy, an indie art direction adventure as I walk through the steps I used to deconstruct the game's previous, less engaging art style and rebuild it over a short period of time into what it is today.
The topics covered will range from low-level fare, such as how to properly analyze an art style and design effective pipelines, to higher level or philosophical topics such as the best way to entertain unconventional or crazy ideas and how to tell if something is truly good enough. I'll keep the takeaways as broad as possible so there should be something for everyone regardless of experience or discipline.
Part Crash Course, Part Post-Mortem, Thursday, March 2nd at 5.30. I hope to see you there.
