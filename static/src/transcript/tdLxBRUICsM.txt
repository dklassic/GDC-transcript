Hi, my name is Aur√©lie. I'm a gameplay programmer on For Honor.
I've been working at Ubisoft Montreal for about five years now, and I'm really excited this year because I get to talk at GDC.
I'll be giving a talk aimed mostly for designers and programmers, gameplay programmers, about a gameplay system that we worked on on For Honor that enables the designers to create and iterate on their gameplay ideas without having to go through a programmer.
I'm so excited to share all this information with you.
I'll see you on the battlefield!
