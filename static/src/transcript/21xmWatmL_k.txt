Hi, I'm Don Rawitsch and I invite you to attend my retrospective session on the history of the Oregon Trail Educational Computer Game.
Many of you probably first encountered Oregon Trail in school during the 1980s on a personal computer, but we're going to start back a decade when I was one of three 21-year-old teachers who co-invented the game working on a mainframe and a teletype.
We'll take a deep dive into where the idea came from and how it was designed without the benefit of graphics or sound.
So hitch up your wagons and join me on the adventure that launched educational computing's best known game.
See you there!
