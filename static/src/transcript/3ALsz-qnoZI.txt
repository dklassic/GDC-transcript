Hello there, I'm Matt from Shut Up and Sit Down, coming to you from the DICE dimension where we reside eternally.
We're going to be at GDC this year running things.
Yeah, and by running things I mean sitting at wooden picnic tables and playing board games.
Check out classics from 2016 like Captain Sonar, Innis, Junk Art, and more.
About seven more things. Exactly.
This is our third year running the booth at GDC where you can come along, decompress, and look at some interesting designs.
So when you're inevitably exhausted by people with weird headsets telling you that they are the future and you need to give them the money, come and spend time with us, because it's better.
Bye!
