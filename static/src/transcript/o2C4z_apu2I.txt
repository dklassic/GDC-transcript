Hello everybody. Welcome to Offroad Trading Company and RTS without guns. Before we get started, please remember to silence your cell phones. All right. So, all right. There we go. That's exciting. All right. So, this is, these are the games that I've shipped, which shows that my main background is a strategy game developer.
Oh my gosh.
And this is who I am now.
This is the project I've been working on for the last three years.
Awful Training Company.
And in fact, this is a game I've wanted to make kind of my entire career.
And so I was very excited I finally got a chance to do that.
And one of the things I want to talk about today is I really feel that real-time strategy is actually an underexplored genre. That there is a lot more possibilities out there than what we see from the current RTS games. So, what makes an RTS?
Some of the things we often think of are not having a high APM, actions per minute, a game where you're selecting a lot of units, moving around really quickly.
have war, they tend to be, hold on, I'm sorry. There we go.
All right, they tend to be short games.
They tend to involve combat.
You know, this is what you think of as a traditional RTS.
However, if you dig a little deeper, what about Majesty?
That was a fantastic RTS game that had no unit selection.
You basically just put down bounties on the map and the units kind of moved around based off of like these, you know, you basically put down, so if you attack this, you know, this works here, I'll give you a certain amount of money.
and the units kind of followed around according to those wishes. Or, Adam's zombie smasher, which is a game that had no fog of war. Or what about Sins of a Solar Empire, which is almost like a 4X RTS. These games, a game of sins often took 3, 4, 5 hours. So, what about a game with no combat?
and most importantly, I didn't just pick three random RTS games to show that you can buck conventions. These are all three classics in the genre. If you could only play four RTS games, you'd be much better off playing each of these three and just one from the first set of games I showed you.
which were StarCraft, Command and Conquer, Age of Empires, Company of Heroes. They're all great games but to some extent they're a little bit interchangeable because they have a lot of the same parts. And kind of at a core level they're kind of trying to do the same thing. So how can we make an RTS without combat?
So this is what an operating company looks like. And it is economic RTS. So what that means is the conflict in the game revolves around the free market. There's a lot of resources in the game. You know, typical RTS you might have two to four resources. We have 13.
and each of them has a price. And the price goes up and down depending upon player actions. If players make a lot of iron and sell it in the market, it goes down. If players are buying a lot of food, then the price goes up. And basically you do well at the game by figuring out what are the resources that are going to have, you know, the highest demand and the least supply.
You look around, what's going to be worth a lot in a couple days and what are my opponents producing the least of?
That's how you're able to make a lot of money.
There's no direct combat and the game ends basically with a hostile takeover.
So the aggression in the game is in the stock market.
The basic goal is to make as much money as possible and then you eventually win by taking that money and buying up the stock of your opponents.
So to talk about how I got here, I first want to talk about the games that influenced me to get to off world. Because even though off world is a pretty unusual game, there's not really another, economic RTS is sort of a subgenre I basically invented here. It actually has a lot of antecedents. Pretty much almost every element of the game was taken from other games. Almost everything in it is actually recognizable, it just hasn't been together in this specific assortment.
So here's Belter. It's a very, very old hex encounter war game from 1979. And it's a game I played as a kid. And it's what first introduced the idea of going out, exploring, discovering resources and them having sort of different levels.
So in Belter you would go from asteroid to asteroid and you'd roll a dice and you'd discover if it had low or medium or high iron or gas or whatever. And that's where I got the basic idea for resources in Offworld.
Mule is pretty obvious influence on off world. That's where I got the basic idea for claims. And mule had limited claims which is really important. Like in a traditional RTS, you're able to gather resources anywhere.
There's really no limitation on it.
where as in Mule you get a new claim every turn.
And that's really what makes the game interesting because you have to make a tough choice of are you going to invest in food or smith ore or energy or whatever.
And I wanted that same mechanic in Offworld.
and I also borrowed auctions from Mule because it was such an important part of the game. Our auctions work very differently.
They are much more like traditional auctions. But basically after playing Mule, I knew that we had to have auctions. It was such a cool thing to have.
Board games have influenced Offworld a lot, obviously, for people who've played it.
They often, I often hear that, you know, Offworld feels like, you know, a board game that's on your computer, it's like one that would be like way too complex to play, but it still feels like a board game, which is interesting, because people don't necessarily say that about other RTS games.
And I think, I think the reason they do is because we really commit to transparency in the rules in Offworld.
So here, for example, I'm showing you some detail of how a steel mine works.
And it's showing that basically you put in one unit of iron in one side and then out the other side comes half a unit of steel. And all of the buildings in Alfa World basically work like that. They're very chunky.
on the map there, you see those little cubes that represent iron. You don't have to take a big jump to think of all those sort of your games with little wooden cubes that you tend to have. So we definitely wanted to give people that feeling.
Railroad tycoon is another huge influence on us. And that was where I kind of got the concept of your shipping lanes. That there's sort of a geographical element of, you know, you have a base somewhere and then you go out and get your resources and then you ship them around. You get iron from one place, you take it here, you turn it into steel and you do something with that. You get water from one place, you take it here, you turn it into fuel, then you take the fuel and you turn it into chemicals.
So indeed, you got to talk about this here, which is the resource chart in Railroad Tycoon, which is another really big core part of Offworld, is all of this arrangement, how you turn resources into each one, turn one resource into another.
As an aside, I spent a long time online trying to find a resource chart for the original railroad tycoon and the only one I could find was in German. Which I think is very telling because if you know Germans, the only thing better than a game where you can turn wheat into bread is a game in which you first get to turn it into flour and then you turn it into bread.
So this is their type of game.
And this is what the resource chart looks like in off world.
So actually it's almost the same number of types of buildings and types of resources and conversions.
And some are a little more complex than others.
The electronics factory requires three inputs.
Some spit out two inputs.
The reactor takes water and splits it into oxygen fuel, which creates some interesting dynamics in the system.
But here's actually the big one.
It's Age of Empires.
And specifically, there's just one building in Age of Empires that has a huge influence on off world. And that building is the market, which you can see here kind of on the left side of the screen. In fact, it's selected, so you can see in the bottom left corner of the screen there's this interface, which I want to zoom in here. So this is the market building where you can, there's four resources in Age of Empires. Food, wood, stone, gold.
and using the market you can trade any of those resources at any time for using gold. And the wonderful thing about this system is that the prices are global. So...
you know, I start buying wood, I get wood, but the price goes up for everyone. So if someone out there notices that the price of wood has gotten really high, they can start taking advantage of that. They can produce a lot of wood, turn it to gold, and gold is really valuable in nature empires. You can, you know, some of the most powerful units like knights are made with gold. So they can really take advantage of this sort of market inefficiency by turning basically something worthless like, not worthless, but less worthwhile, less worthy.
whatever that word is, taking that wood, turning it into gold, turning it into a really powerful unit. So you can see there's kind of a direct line here from the market in Age of Empires right to our resource market in Offworld. In many ways you can say that we made an entire game about just this one building in Age of Empires.
and there's something interesting I'd like to note, which is you see there's actually two prices there, right?
So you can sell wood for 76 gold, and you have to spend 142 to buy it.
So they're actually kind of like, they're hedging their bets, basically.
They're doubling the price to make sure people don't.
do too much trading. It's an interesting part of the game, but it's just something to the side. It's a supplement to the main game. They didn't want this part of the game to take over by having those two prices, the buy and sell price, be too close.
And when I first made off world, I actually just adopted what they did. I had the buy and sell price be, I'd have the buy price be double the sell price. And it wasn't really interesting. The game never really took off internally when we were playing until I decided I don't know if this is working. I just collapsed the price into one price. So when you buy it and sell it, it's the same price.
And then the game suddenly became so much more interesting because then there were so many new ways to get an advantage off of the market. At that point it was all about arbitrage. The market could change within a few seconds and you can make you can make a huge profit off of something very quickly.
Where here, you buy wood for $142, you're going to have to wait a long time for the price to get high enough for you to make sense to actually sell it.
You probably are never going to be able to make money that way.
So, collapsing into one price made a huge difference.
All right, so but why build a game around a free market at all?
And for me it comes down to, what I call adaptive game play. Adaptive game play means you are adapting your strategy to the current environment, which is really the core of strategy gaming. There is not one choice.
This is an RPG. We are not letting you decide how you want to play the game. The whole point is to see what environment the game is presenting to you and then try to make the best choice depending upon that.
that's adaptation. And I think all good strategy games have that. And I want to kind of go into all of the things in off world that enable that. And a lot of these things you'll see come back to a free market. So, you know, number one, you got the random maps. Right? And different type of train favor different types of resources. So you might have some maps where there's a lot of iron and very little water. Or you might have another map where there's the reverse. And that totally changes the dynamics in the market.
If you see a map where there's very little water, then you want to make sure that you monopolize that early.
Maybe you try to grab up as much of the water as possible because you know that by the end of the game, the prices of all the life support materials are going to be super high, and everyone's going to have to buy that from you.
We have random events in the game.
You see on the...
On the left there, there's a fuel shortage and an iron shortage, which is causing sort of like a temporary spike in price for those resources. On the right, there's an oxygen surplus and a chemical surplus, which is sort of doing the opposite. So these are other things that can sort of mix up the supply-demand ratio on the market.
we introduced random prices for when the game begins.
On the left side, those are kind of what you'd say are the base prices for all the resources.
So you know, kind of the more advanced resources like electronics and glass started out more expensive.
Things like water and...
iron and aluminum, things you can just get straight from the ground, start out cheaper.
And so, at some point I was like, well I feel like I really want to have the game a little more variety, make the game have a little more variety because when the game starts with the same prices, you kind of end up always starting with the same buildings, you know, based off of that kind of dynamic.
And so I was like, well let's just roll the dice and see what the prices are.
And so I did what you see there in the middle column, whereas I just said, you know, kind of prices all over the place.
And that sort of works at a high level.
It definitely made the game have more variety because things were very, very different.
But the problem was there was too much cognitive load on the player when the game began.
You know, they look at that chart of numbers and it's just kind of like, it's just a mishmash of numbers.
it's hard to process all at once. So what we did instead is what you see in the right column, which is that we either double a resource, the double resources price or half it. And then we also give a little colored hint. So you can see immediately when you see that, when the game starts, this is exactly what the market is going to look like. You click quickly and you're like, oh, there's four resources, or double price and two resources are half price.
you know, and that can hugely affect, you know, how you want to start. So here you see iron is green, it's 40 bucks, that means it's double price. So you might want to grab two iron tiles instead of one at the beginning of the game. Here's another thing, random auctions. So over the course of the game, you know, usually every 24 hours basically, you get an auction comes up and that can be for a patent, it can be for a tile, it can be for something on the black market. And that's an interesting, you know, sort of the game can throw at you because the players can't anticipate what's going to come up. What you're seeing here is some fan art that was made based off of a game that's become infamous among our community. It was from a tournament where two players both started the game where due to random prices, steel was like I think double price and iron was half price.
So they both were going to be very clever and just build three steel mills to take advantage of that, you know, price discrepancy and just create a lot of steel. But since they both did that, it basically drove the price of iron up so high that then the steel mills became unprofitable.
And basically both players got stuck. They couldn't even upgrade. They were both just sitting there kind of like waiting like, well, what should happen now? And what the game decided to let happen was suddenly auction off a high iron tile.
and that was it basically.
It's like well whoever gets this tile wins the game I guess.
So the auction kept going up and up and up and just for reference here, a typical auction usually goes from maybe 20,000, maybe 30,000 if it's something really desirable.
So it went up to 60,000, 90, 98, 128.
192 and eventually one guy got it for $224,000. And just for reference, if you have in a two player game, if you have $400,000 you can probably just win the game at that point. That's probably enough to win. So he got the high iron tile, but this is what you call the winner's curse at an auction. He spent so much that when you spend that much it goes directly into your debt and his basically his stock price immediately collapsed to $1. And...
and the other player won just by basically buying them out.
So the thing here is they just said they had never been in this situation before of like how do we value this high iron tile?
There is some correct price.
It was probably maybe 90,000 would be my guess, but I'm not sure, you know, it's just you gotta figure it out as the game goes, right?
And that's what's great about adaptive gameplay, right?
You know, you have to, you know, this is this unusual situation, you gotta figure it out on the fly.
So here's the black market. These are a bunch of items that can basically mess with your opponents. Things like EMP which knocks out their buildings or mutiny where you literally steal their buildings. Dynamite where you blow up their buildings. You get the drift. There's some positive ones here like an adrenaline boost that makes your stuff go faster.
But, you know, like when we started out, we had maybe six or seven, and that seemed like fun.
But it was like, well, we could push this more.
And so, you know, we eventually, we ship with maybe like 18 or 19 effects.
And, you know, that's an obvious place to basically mix things up each game.
It's like there's a deck of black market items, and you draw up seven each game.
whatever comes up can greatly influence how you want to play.
If a game has no pirates, that changes the dynamics.
Then it's safer to ship valuable resources over long distances because you know someone isn't going to be able to steal them from you. But here's the really big one, which is opponent decisions. The choices the other players make in the game, you start at one place, but the game ends in such a different place.
We see a lot, you know, our community has a bunch of tournaments that they run kind of regularly. You'll often see these games where two players, you know, very high level players go against each other.
The first game it ends very quickly in like four days with majority buyout. The next game it's this huge long affair, goes 10, 12 days, ends with a bunch of off world markets, where the most advanced buildings. It all kind of goes back to kind of these early decisions that those players meant that made the game spin off in these different directions.
So put all these together, there's a lot of things that are different about each game of off world, which is how you get such high replayability. And so talking about opponent choices, one of the real big ones here is when you found your headquarters.
which of the four headquarter types, which is kind of like StarCraft, are you going to be Terran, are you going to be Zerg, are you going to be Protoss. But one thing that one of our testers came up with an idea early on in the project, he said, what if you chose your headquarters after the game began, right? So, you know, what if you chose your And that was great.
That was sort of like a breakthrough idea because it, going back to the opponent decisions, you know, like that is such an important one, like what headquarters can be, because that radically changes the market.
And I'll get to that in a little bit.
But I just want to point out that, you know, when you work in a genre, sometimes you're not aware of the baggage you're inheriting.
You know, I never really thought about like, well maybe you should pick your headquarter type after the game begins because every RTS you've ever played that's something you do in the set up screen. That's just sort of a given. And doing it this way was great. I mean, it was like that idea came up.
You know, I implemented it that afternoon. We tried it right away and like immediately we knew that was what we wanted to do. So, the, what headquarters you choose is so important because it really radically alters your relationship to the market.
The first one here is the expansive. They are sort of like the vanilla HQ. They just have a lot of sort of straight forward bonuses. Makes them a good one for new players. But they are not going to radically change the market unlike these guys, the robots. They don't consume any life support.
and they ship, they use, instead of using fuel, they use power for their vehicles.
So that's obviously going to radically change the market.
You know, you see there's a bunch of robots coming into the game, well probably the prices of food, oxygen, and fuel are not going to get all that high.
Here's another big one. The scavengers, they use carbon instead of steel for their buildings and for upgrading their headquarters. Most everyone else uses steel. And steel is like the super key early game resource. When you're at level one, you almost certainly want to build some steel mills. And they kind of like, they're able to get around that. They can just focus on carbon. They can basically ignore iron entirely. So they're playing a game where they only care about four resources, which makes them potentially really powerful.
And then here's my favorite, headquarter type, the scientific.
They're able to put their buildings directly on primary resources.
So a farm, for example, turns water into food.
Right, so for the scientists, they can just put their farms directly on the water.
They don't need a water pump to make the water and then send it to the farm.
They can just do it directly.
So that changes the market too because they're not going to be producing primary resources which often end up flooding the market by the end of the game. So there's actually a bit of an Achilles heel here for the scientists which is that if you're playing them, they probably don't have any iron mines, they probably don't have any water pumps. So if you're their opponent, you can start producing some water yourself.
And I'm getting a little ahead of myself here because I'm going to be talking about the hack array. But that's a building artificially create a water shortage.
So you can drive up the price of water and know you'll make a lot of money just yourself because you know that the scientist probably doesn't have any.
Let me talk about some of the more advanced buildings in the game. This is the patent lab. This is the kind of like really unique technologies. Things like teleportation, so you don't need ships to move your goods around. Something like cold fusion lets you use water instead of power. Slant drilling is a neat one.
It means you can get sort of the I drink your milkshake patent.
You basically get to use the resources in tiles adjacent to yours. So if someone else got a monopoly on you can get slant drilling and claim a tile next to silicon and start mining his resource. It feels great. Each of these has kind of like a really kind of strange interesting orthogonal effect. I was like, oh, it wouldn't be cool. A lot of RTS games have these type of things, these technologies that you resource, that you research.
that change things about the game.
And I thought I was going to be real clever and be like, oh, what if we make them patents so that when you research it, only you get it and everyone else is locked out from it.
And so there's this race to get these patents and like, oh wow, I came up with this awesome new game mechanic.
Except it sounds pretty familiar if you play the little game called Civ IV.
Because I basically just re-implemented Wonders.
I actually didn't even realize it.
Someone just brought this up in a press interview.
I'm like, oh yeah.
All right. I guess you're right. All right. So here's the hack array which I mentioned earlier. This is a really neat one. I love this building. So I showed you there were the shortages and surpluses that happened in the game. Those happen randomly.
There's just a little RNG thing in the background that kind of rolls every once in a while and decides what's going to happen.
But with a hack array, you can basically trigger these things artificially. So you can create, for example, an aluminum shortage.
you find out that it's coming and then the aluminum shortage happens. But the other players have no idea whether was this a real aluminum shortage or an artificial one. The effect is the same, but the trick is if you find out someone is artificially shorting aluminum, they're probably doing that because they bought up a huge stockpile of it.
and they're basically trying to drive up the price to take advantage of that.
And so you want to basically take an action against that.
You either want to create your own aluminum surpluses or make sure you sell your own aluminum, drive the price down before they do.
But I don't know, it's just a neat thing.
Creates a lot of paranoia.
and we took it further in multiplayer so that when you put down a hacker array, it's covered with a hologram, which basically makes it look like another building. So you're not even aware if your opponents have hacker arrays. So you get a lot of people talking back and forth when the game goes, like when you see a shortage, you're like, oh, is that a real one or a fake one? And the gig gets sort of up when the same shortage happens like twice in a row. Then you're like, oh, okay, he's going for it.
So let's talk about the black market. So I said there was no combat in the game. Maybe that's a lie because there's the black market. There is a way to kind of like blow up people's stuff and shoot down their blimps and do stuff like that. However, what I say is when we started the game, we kind of like We took out all of the zero sum combat mechanics.
When you have tanks and barracks and military stuff, that stuff tends to dominate, so we wanted to go to the other extreme.
But once we went there, then we're like, well, maybe we can start introducing some of this stuff back into the game, but we just need to figure out a way to make sure it doesn't dominate.
And what was neat about our solution was it actually kind of fits as sort of like a free market mechanic.
Which is the idea here is you see each of those black market items has a different price.
Like you see pirates there, the second on the left is $6,000.
And so what happens here is if I buy pirates, the price goes up, and it goes up for everyone in the game.
So if I buy it for 6,000, then the next person will have to buy it for 10,000, and then the next person after that will have to buy it for 16,000, and then it'll be 25,000. And eventually the price will get high enough that it just doesn't make sense to buy pirates anymore. And that basically solved the problem, because you know each of these black market items is only going to get used so many times in the game.
and it also has this nice side effect of when you saw the price go up, that means you know your opponent just bought one.
So if you saw that the price of dynamite just went up, then you know that he's probably going to do something with some dynamite, which might change what you decide to do.
and we put in pirates. Pirates are a pretty interesting item on the black market because they allow you to actually steal a resource from another player. And actually in the In an early prototype, we did actually experiment for a while with having pirates and that you could move around a map and basically place on people's shipping lanes and those would blow up their ships and you get their stuff.
But then we're like, well, we need something to counter the pirates, so okay, maybe we'll let you build police ships and then we'll fly the police ships over and the police ships will shoot down the pirates.
and you know, it's kind of like, once you go down that road, it's kind of a slippery slope towards just making a regular RTS.
So, and you know, without really enough benefit there, you know, like we're not differentiating ourselves enough and like that part of the game isn't ever going to be as fully featured as a real RTS.
So eventually we just pulled it back to like, let's just turn this into this high level thing that you don't have to micromanage, just fire and forget, you just basically hit.
click a tile, place down the pirates, they manage themselves and they basically steal X number of units and then they go away. And then it was, it kind of fit the game again at that point.
All right, so another cool thing on the black market are the holograms and spies.
So you put a hologram down, and it basically makes your building look like one of the other buildings that's adjacent to it.
And the typical building you want to hide is the off-world market, because that's sort of the most powerful building of the game.
It's kind of the end-game building that you use to ship resources off-world, where the prices are very high, and they're also constant.
They don't really go down from oversupplying the market.
you can sometimes you see in games people will oversupply the market on Mars which will drive the prices down and then the only way to basically end the game is to go off world.
So because of the black market you really want to hide your off world market.
So you want to put a hologram on it right?
And then the counter for that is either you know watching the other player really closely or you place down spies and the spies will kind of reveal holograms within a certain range so you have a little thing going back and forth between how those two things work together.
However, I made a choice early on, as soon as I thought of the idea, I was like, oh, that sounds great, but it will never work in single player. Like people, because basically, basically it's like a, it's a catch 22 for the AI. There's no way you can write an AI to handle holograms and spies.
Let's say, first of all, you might just do a bad job. It's hard to do. So you might just do a bad job writing the AI, which is not good, obviously. But what if you do a good job?
If you do a good job having the AI be able to identify where holograms are, and they're able to figure out where you tend to put holograms and they're able to target your buildings because they guessed right, people are just not going to believe that the AI played fairly. I can tell you from years of experience working on AI, that's exactly what's going to happen. So it's a lose-lose situation. There's no way to make people believe the AI. Players don't trust the AI and they find cheats even when there aren't any.
However, I really like the idea, so I just said, well, let's just try adding something that's multiplayer only. And it works great in multiplayer. It's not a problem in single player. And I guess maybe that's okay. Something I hadn't really tried all that much before in other games I made were single player or multiplayer, where we tried to make it basically the same.
Okay. I think the real crucial piece to make the whole black market work. So black market was fun. Got in the game, people were having fun with it. But there was still a sense of like you know, I lost the game because I got EMP too much or my buildings got mutiny at a key time and there was nothing I could do.
once the opponent tried to hit me, there was absolutely nothing I could do. So we introduced the goon squad, which will protect you from sabotage. So you put a goon squad on your off-road market, someone tries to dynamite it, it's blocked. However, it's not just blocked.
the person you try to attack with the dynamite gets your dynamite. And also normally when you attack someone with a black market, you don't know who attacked you. That's a hidden information. When you attack someone with a goon squad, that information is announced for everyone. And we found that humans are surprisingly very vindictive.
If someone blows up my off world market, or tries to, and I find out because of a goon squad, there's a pretty good chance I'm gonna take that dynamite and hit that person back.
Even if that's not the best move for me to make, it just feels good, and you just do it, and that's that.
But the real thing about the goon squad is it's not actually, because there's only gonna be so many goon squads bought in the course of a game, it's price goes up just like all the black market items.
It's the threat of a goon squad that's important.
The fact that you know, the player could put it down, and the effects of hitting a goon squad are so devastating.
So, it turns into this mind game.
Surely, someone wouldn't be dumb enough to build a geotherm so early and not goon squad it.
Of course, then you're tempted to not goon squad it because they never think you would not goon squad it.
Anyway, it's fun.
All right, I wanna talk about the stock market a little bit.
early on, the way it works, you buy into other opponents, you buy into your opponents and at some point you have enough money to buy them out and you buy them out, you actually get all their stuff. You get their headquarters, you get all their buildings, you get everything. And that worked okay, but the problem was it was just too much for most players to handle. It was just like I got all this new stuff, I don't understand it, I don't know how it works. And in an 8 player game, it was...
absolutely insane. So we want to try something different. So we try what we call a subsidiary system where once a player gets bought out, they basically get taken over by a very conservative AI that runs the company to make money and that money is distributed to their owners. So in this case you see the subsidiary here is King Morgan.
he's owned partially by blue and partially by green so his money gets split between them.
And that worked great. It also had the big advantage of buying out a player was no longer all or nothing. We had this problem before where if there were two people A and B were competing to buy out C, whoever ends up winning that battle, there's a pretty good chance they're going to end up winning the game. Whereas here, both of those players were aiming to get King Morgan, they both got half of them, they're both kind of like in a good position to continue on to win the game.
Here's another thing that we introduced after that, which was majority buyouts, which was this concept of once the other players got to own six of your shares, you're just immediately removed from the game.
And you immediately become a subsidiary.
This was important because there is sort of like a king-making problem in the game.
We do support four-player, six-player, eight-player free-for-alls.
If it's very clear a player is going to lose, you kind of want them eliminated as soon as possible.
Because you don't want them hanging around, buying things on the black market, messing with other players.
You want to get them out of the game.
Also, this created, kind of on accident, kind of like actually a rush boom turtle mechanic in the game in that the majority buyout is sort of like the rush.
you know, you're kind of putting in your money aggressively to take something out early.
Whereas the total mechanic is you kind of buy up shares of your own stock to protect yourself.
And then the boom is basically, I'm going to take my money, I'm going to invest it in my own infrastructure to hopefully make more money in the long run.
And it's funny how it just kind of worked naturally.
Which basically led to, totally led to the idea of the locked shares, which is that once you get to, once you own five of your own shares of stock, they're kind of like all combined into one super share.
And so that's a real key point in the game.
You kind of want to get to those five shares, then you know you're safe from a majority buyout.
this is masquerade mode. This is something that also came hand in hand with the black market once it came in the game. Which was this concept of you play a multiplayer, you get hit by the black market but there's a sense of like, oh, you hit me because you think I'm the best player or you think I'm the most threatening player or you just want to beat me because I beat you last game and that's not fair. So at any rate, what, and I actually wasn't a fan of this. This was my team. They really wanted to get in. They put it in on their own and it worked.
So, you know, that's great.
And the idea here is your identity is hidden.
So here you see me, I'm one of the players, and then there's Clark and Herbert and Asimov, and those are, I don't know who those are.
So you can't attack a specific player, you have to just kind of like attack the person who looks like him during the lead.
And anyone who's played board games knows that this is a classic dynamic, you can get around the table.
Unfortunately, there's no way to hide people's identity in real life, but you can in an off world.
So this is something we did here with multiplayer to kind of like, we're not, we don't have a huge user base, but the people who play multiplayer love multiplayer, so we want to do as much as we can to enable them to play with each other.
So we did things like, when you go to the main menu of the game, if someone is waiting in the queue, in sort of a rank play, to play with someone, we tell them, hey, there's a game available.
And you click on that, the screen on the left, it takes you to the screen on the right, and it says, oh, there's a match available for 1v1, or there's three players waiting for a four player.
So you really want to help.
bring people into the game, let them know that if they join they can start a game right now.
Also, when you're in the queue waiting for a match, we actually let you play single player.
So you can play a skirmish game, you can play the daily challenge, you can watch a replay file, you can do all this stuff while it's waiting for an opponent, and as soon as you find that opponent, you'll get moved into the multiplayer game.
I think this has made a huge difference for keeping our multiplayer community alive, even with a pretty low multiplayer player base.
Yeah, so I want to talk now a little bit about early access.
And to start out with, I want to kind of give you a sense of what our project looked like throughout development.
So I started the game basically in the summer of 2013.
So that lovely shot in the upper left is what the game looked like right off the beginning.
and then in January we started introducing hex tiles and terrain basically, and then you can see things slowly improve step by step.
The August 2014 is an important date, that's when we had what we called our founders program, which was you could come to our website, buy the game.
we actually didn't show people what the game looked like, so they were actually buying it blind, so I will be always grateful to people who took part in that program.
But they bought into it, we sent them a Steam code, they downloaded the game, and then they were able to start playing it, and this is what it looked like.
So it looked passable, right?
You could imagine that it could eventually become a game.
And this is the rest of the development.
The one in the upper left there is, that's what it looked like when it launched in early access.
And then from there on, It's interesting because we went up in early access, we heard a lot of people say, oh wow, this looks like a finished game, but you can see clearly, just look at the cliffs, for example, like they're, you know, it just, there was so much more that we could improve in the game, but it was really important to me to release it early so that I could learn about the game from our players while we still had time to do something about it.
So.
What I think early access is important is the most common problem in the industry is waste. And that is people making decisions and having to wait months or even years before they know whether those decisions were good or not. And I learned this lesson while working on Civ 3 and Civ 4. Civ 3 was made completely in a vacuum. The only people who ever played Civ 3 before the game came out were either the people on the development team or the testers. That's it.
and we shipped the game, it had a lot of issues. And the worst part is a lot of the issues were fairly obvious. There's the things that we should have caught and we could have easily done something about if we just knew about them at the time. So the CIV 4, I want to do it completely differently.
After Civ 3 shipped, I really embedded myself into the Civ community, found some of the best voices in the community and helped them guide me to know how to basically patch Civ 3.
So then the next step was, well, let's bring these people on board, create sort of this private testing group where they could play Civ 4 early.
And I mean really early.
They played it in the first half of the project.
it was, Civ 4 was about a two and a half year development cycle and they played it at about the 12 month, you know, 12 months after development.
So they played it when it was really early, it was really ugly, but I think that's the key reason why Civ 4 was really well received, is that we had this great iteration time with the fan community, you know, with actual players who are outside of the team and didn't have all the prejudices you have inside of your team.
And we saw this immediately once we went up on early access, that we were blind to certain problems in the game.
And probably the most obvious example of this is the reveal map option.
So the way we had made Offworld was it has a scanning mode when the game begins, which is basically the exploration part, and you just start clicking around the map, revealing tiles slowly, until you find what you think is a good founding location.
And that works great in single player, but the multiplayer community just found it completely unacceptable.
because basically you imagine two players, one of them scans one direction, one of them scans the other direction.
The person who went east finds a great founding location, puts down their headquarters.
Person who went west feels like they lost the game because they just randomly went the wrong direction.
we had game mechanics to basically balance that.
Of like, well, whoever found second, you get extra claims and so on and so forth.
But the main thing is perception.
Like at that point, perception is reality.
It felt unfair to people.
So we tried something different.
And this happened like within a month or two of early access.
We like, we know we gotta do something about this.
So I came up with the reveal map option, which means that basically the game, the map starts completely revealed and you have basically kind of like a reverse auction that you could found immediately if you want to, but you're gonna have to take on $200,000 of debt.
And that price is just gonna get, kind of like slowly ticked down.
I got this idea I think from Frozen Synapse, they have kind of like a similar idea of like, you know, show the whole map and then you kind of bid on the different starting location.
But like, you know, basically the number kind of keeps ticking down until it gets to the point where you're like, well, I think the best spot on the map is worth say $40,000 of debt, so you're able to, you know, so you commit.
You're the first mover, you get it.
And then you find out if you made the right choice, you know, over the course of the game.
And that worked. The multiple computer were like, yes, that's it. That's the way they play the game, period. And if we had been a traditional game where we didn't go through early access, we would have found this out two months after launch instead of 12 months before launch. That makes a pretty big difference because we then had 12 months to iterate on just this option itself. It became a core part of the game instead of a hacky fix that we had to do post launch.
Another thing that was really important is that I knew we were going to make major changes in early access and there have been games in early access that have made major changes that have really upset their community. And this is a hard thing. There's no simple answer here because the community thinks they have one game, they're happy with it, so the game changes.
what, you know, like, and if they're unhappy with it, it can lead to, you know, it can lead to some really bad feelings, some bad reviews, lead to controversy, basically.
We didn't want that to happen, so what we did is anytime we had some major change come through, and usually this meant something on the stock market, like the majority buyout feature, what we would do is we'd say, hey, we got this new feature, but it's an option.
we would introduce as an option. When you set the game you can decide whether you're going to use it or not. But what we also did then is we do the update, hey, the new feature is here.
Hey, and we're also going to host a community tournament. But if you play in the tournament, you have to play using this new feature.
So which would encourage people to opt in because they want to play the official Mohawk tournament. They want to win.
So it's not just the games inside of the tournament, but people would start practicing using this option, of course, because they wanted to get good at it. So immediately we get all this great feedback on this feature. It's kind of like using, by incentivizing them to try it out, forcing it on them.
I believe it's really important to get closer to your community.
This is my friends list on steam.
And you see these are some of the hardest core off-road players.
You see people who have played games here for thousands of hours.
And this is a sign that I'm really close with them.
They see something wrong with the game, they'll message me immediately.
And we'll talk back and forth about it.
Twitch. I think Twitch is great. We stream on it weekly and we use it for tournaments. And I think what's great about it is it's just this public space where everyone can come together. You start streaming the game, so all your fans start to come there and it just kind of like snowballs from there because they meet each other and then they make connections and then they'll start streaming themselves. In fact, that's one thing we did early with our tournaments is we basically said if you're going to play in our tournament, you have to stream your game.
which meant that a lot of our hardcore players then suddenly became Twitch streamers and then it kind of like, you know, multiplied from there.
So that's something that worked great.
Discords.
I don't know how many of you guys are using Discord yet for games but I think Discord is going to become a really big deal. It's kind of completely replaced. Our forums are dead, our Reddit is dead, all of the action now is on Discord. And it's because it's real-time interaction. And so in fact, when you go into the game, we kind of point people to Discord right away, like, hey, join our Discord channel. It's a really friendly, healthy community. You'll often see people come on there and like, hey, I'm new to the game. And people say, oh, welcome, let me help you give you advice about how to play.
I really, I really, and also it's a place where, you can see here, the channel I'm in is actually like a feedback, a private feedback channel I have for some of the more core players.
So like it's a way to also kind of like bring them all together in one place to talk about stuff that's coming further down the road without having to expose everyone to that.
and here's one of the nice benefits about being so close to your players. We have a daily challenge in the game. You play a single player game on the same random seed that changes every 24 hours and we have a replay feature where when you finish the game, you can see the the replay gets uploaded and then you can, all the other players can download and see how everyone else, how did someone get that great time in the daily challenge?
So what I would do is I would come into the morning, I'd open up the daily challenge, see who got the best score, watch the replay, and I'd be immediately like, oh, they're using this, they're using this strategy against the AI, or they're doing this thing, or like they're using this thing, and I think that's totally imbalanced.
So what I would do is like, I would then see what they did, I would change the AI, I would make a build, I'd push it to steam, and then I'd contact that person, and be like, hey, try what you did this morning again.
And then I'd find out whether I fixed the problem or not.
I mean, this is amazing, right?
This is like 24 hour iteration directly with the community.
I never dreamed of that, like working on Civ 4.
Even though I had players, you had this weeks of lag between when you do something and when you find out whether your decisions were good.
This is, it's amazing to be able to do this.
And you know, community extends your game, right?
Like we had so many people playing the game, putting up videos that like within our release week, we had a million and a half views.
Some of the super fans have eventually helped out with the team, whether that means streaming or testing or Blue's designed our last DLC that just came out.
You'll see people on Discord basically say, like, hey, post your, you know, for new players who are having a hard time, post your replay, I'll take a look at it, I'll give you advice.
It's just, you know, community is important.
I mean, people understand that.
All right, so.
probably some things we do differently about early access if we did it again. One is we had basically a full QA pass.
We would do kind of a big monthly updates. Which meant we kind of did a full QA pass because we wanted them to be polished. And that's fine but it's kind of grueling on the team to put them through that process. You're releasing every month, we're a small team, we want to be moving quickly. So we did a couple things to help ourselves out. We had a next version branch which is basically one we could update whenever we wanted to without going through QA because you had to opt into it. So that helped. But I think that next time around probably what I would do is I would just have a build machine that automatically updates the public version every Monday.
and if there's a problem, just do a roll back or a hot fix.
Like, it's okay, I've found, you know, if you're in touch with the community, like, it's okay.
Like, I think that they're generally forgiving of problems if you're responsive.
I would probably also wait a little bit longer to go up in early access. Be aware that your only free press hit comes when you launch on early access. That's kind of like when the press conceive of you as a new game. A lot of the big YouTubers and streamers were only interested in the game the first time around. When we had the final launch they kind of had moved on basically. In some cases you have the worst cases.
We had one very prominent YouTuber viewer.
people ask when it came out in early access, hey, are you going to review this?
And he said, oh, I don't do reviews of early access games.
But then when we came out for real, he basically had forgotten about it.
So, you know, that can happen.
This is how I like to do early access.
Which is, the more steps you have from testing a game internally to releasing it, the better.
You want a whole bunch of smaller incremental steps to get to the final release.
What we did was this.
We had a private beta, and then we jumped all the way to early access.
And I would really like to have two steps in between there, at least.
A public beta, where we're like, OK, now we're going to show our game publicly and let you buy it through our site, the way a game like Factorio work, for example.
And then the next step would be like an unlisted Steam page, which is the idea that your game's up on Steam, people can buy it, but only if they have like an external link to it.
Kind of like one of those like private YouTube videos you can only watch if you happen to have the link.
And your game wouldn't show up on Steam in like searches or in the top sellers or it wouldn't be promoted, that type of thing.
So that's a great way to kind of like have that stream infrastructure.
There's a lot of players who don't want to buy a game until it's on Steam, period, end of story.
So if you have this, you're able to pull in those players, even if you're not kind of like getting the full on hit of being up on early, the full on pressure of being up on early access.
So this is kind of an interesting question.
We were $40 in early access, which was like, made us one of the absolutely most expensive games on there.
And I think you can, if you want to, charge less when you're in early access and then raise the price, which is unusual.
You don't normally get a chance to do that, but I think you can pull it off there.
But I'm not sure if we should have lowered the price because although it did, having a high price definitely hurt our review score on Steam, but it definitely kept.
We didn't have too many players to deal with.
The players that we got during the early access were really what I call high quality players.
They were ones who wanted to be part of the development process, and they were good to work with.
So I'm kind of unsure about this.
But this is kind of like my big general feeling about early access and about games in general.
Eventually your players always understand your game better than you do.
And being able to do early access means you're like fully committing to that truth.
Like that's just the way it is whether you like it or not.
I also have some suggestions for what Valve should do.
As I mentioned, the unlisted store pages, as I understand, I think this might actually be happening now.
I also think there should be an early access category for reviews.
Qualities of games can go up and down over time and it makes a lot of sense that a game when it was early access is going to be better after release than before release.
So I don't see why you wouldn't want to just have a separate category for those type of reviews.
And I also think there shouldn't be sales or refunds during early access.
This is a quote from a Subnautica developer and he points out that, you know...
When you lower the price, you get a group of people who are less dedicated to your product, and there's a pretty good chance you're gonna leave a negative view, because they didn't really research it.
They didn't really know what they were getting into.
And I'd say that the goal here is actually to get fewer players.
You know, you want there to be kind of a bigger hurdle for people to buy your game, Windows on Early Access, so they know they're doing something different.
They're not just buying a game on Steam, they're buying a game that's in development.
Like, so I would be totally happy with, you know.
kind of like a smaller group of players in early access that are more committed to the development process. Also, be good to your early access customers. When we released, we automatically upgraded them all to the deluxe edition. They started off immediately with soundtrack and the DLC that we launched. These are your best fans. Treat them well. So speaking of reviews, I want to mention a few things about them.
So here's a guy who left a negative review a long time ago.
We had a big UI change, he really, really didn't like it.
And our executive producer at Stardock, very politely mentioned like, hey, maybe you wanna, we've released the game, made some changes, you might wanna check it out.
And so I think he, I can't, sorry for me to read, but I think he came back like eight or nine months later and was like, oh, this is great, you fixed everything, I love the game, and changed his review.
So if you take the right attitude toward it, I think that could be.
there's no harm there.
I mean, sometimes you find someone and clearly they're just looking for a different type of game.
That happens to us sometimes.
It feels like sometimes people come to Offworld thinking it's gonna be like Anno and we're never gonna be able to make the game what they want.
And so that's just, you know, unfortunately maybe we need to just do our job of how we're marketing the game in that case.
So here's a negative review of someone who found the game a little bit like a chewing exercise. So he's not a big fan.
Here's one of the interesting things about achievements I didn't expect. They're a great way to give context to negative reviews. So I saw him and I'm like, I feel like Offworld is an exciting, dynamic, challenging game. He doesn't. I wonder why.
I clicked on his profile and I found out, oh, he only played on the second lowest difficulty level. And there's nine difficulty levels in off world. So the second level is like, it's super easy. And so I don't necessarily know what I should do about this problem.
Like should we take away the easy levels? Should we push people to the higher levels more? I'm not sure. But at least I have some context about the complaint. So here's another big question. People often worry about going to early access. Do you get a second launch?
right? And I was very worried about this. I asked all sorts of people who were up on early access what would happen when we came out. And for us at least, we did. We actually sold almost the exact same number of units our first two weeks of early access as we did our first two weeks of release. And month by month we've done better after early access than we did while we were on early access.
That's what you see. Those are our lifetime sales. Those DLC numbers are inflated a little bit because we gave a bunch of DLC away to our early access owners. So it's hard to judge what that would be without that. So maybe half those numbers it's hard to evaluate. But at any rate, our DLC is doing well and we've been able to introduce basically one every month or two. And there's pretty good pick up on it. This is our sales graph from the very beginning of early access to a week ago.
I want to highlight a few points on it. This is early access release. This is final release. You can see the curves look almost identical which is really encouraging. That's nice to know.
These were our first major discounts.
This is the first time we were 50% off, was actually during the early access phase, and the first time we went down to 66% off was actually pretty recently, a few months ago.
And those first discounts are a big deal.
You're gonna need a major spike there.
I think we actually probably should have waited to go 50% off after release.
And so I would definitely do that differently next time around.
These are capsule events, weekend deals, or when we went up on Steam Workshop.
And those are a big deal.
I mean, that's the main thing on Steam is visibility.
You know, being on the front page, that's where the sales come from.
These are the event sales.
The summer sale, Starduck has a sale basically every, excuse me, autumn.
And then the Christmas sale.
And I found this graph really interesting.
This is our total revenue by price.
And so you can see that like 40% of our revenue is basically at full price.
And actually it's definitely higher than that.
I suspect it's almost 50% because these numbers don't include early access for whatever reason the numbers I had were all.
post final release.
And on early access, we never went down below 50%.
But at any rate, there's a sense that once after you release, you're gonna make all of your revenue just off your sales.
And I think this shows that you're still making pretty good revenue even just day after day just selling at a normal price.
All right. So I do want to get to the end here. I think it's important to always ask yourself, you know, beyond all of this stuff about what the development was like and all different random game mechanics, why do you make games at all?
You know, and so I often get asked whether off world is a free trade game or an anti-capitalist game or some other statement on the world economy.
And I don't think games should be trying to make broad statements like, you know, capitalism is good or capitalism is bad. It's just too simplistic. And also the game designer has too much power to set up the rules to support his or her own biases.
This is what I think off world is about.
The prices tell a story.
You know, in off world, if iron costs more than steel, then something has gone wrong.
And you win by taking advantage of these discrepancies.
You know, that puts you in the shoes of a business person, which is really sort of the best that a game can do.
You know, there's a reason why everything costs what it does.
You know, sometimes that goes beyond supply and demand, to government policy, and cultural factors.
But there's always a reason.
And if we don't like what something costs, we should find out why instead of just complaining about it.
But more broadly, I made off with a trading company for the same reason I make all strategy games, that they are anti-ideological. In a good strategy game, the answer to every question, what HQ is best, what resource is most important, what should I research first, should always start with, well, it depends.
The point of having to make tough choices and to adapt to the environment is that there is never ever just one right answer to follow blindly.
And I think that lesson is as important now as it has ever been.
And that's it, thanks for coming.
time for maybe one or two. All right. Go ahead. What impact has the DLCs had on your community? Did it fragment them or bring them together? Um...
So we did a few things to basically make sure that it wouldn't happen.
So like for example, we had a series, DLC series as an asteroid, as large as asteroid, the asteroid belt, an alternate location to play at.
And then we were worried about like, well, what would happen if someone has it, one person has it, another person doesn't, they wanna play a multiplayer.
And we just solved it by saying like, if you have the DLC and you host the game, anyone can join you.
Or in ranked play, it just comes up automatically, even if you don't have the DLC.
like you'll still be exposed to it.
You just won't be able to play in a single player.
So, you know, you just do the best you can, basically.
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, the game is so brilliant, but it's so different from anything else on the market.
I'm curious, how did you approach teaching players how to play the game, since there's so little to look at from other games, so little experience to pull in?
Yeah, so, and this is something I'm particularly bad at, actually, is tutorials.
I just, I'm really bad at that, but fortunately, my business partner and art director, Dorian is, Newcomb, is very good at that.
He worked hard on the CIFI tutorials, which are amazing, and he just, you know, like, fully committed to that part of the project.
So, I'm afraid I don't really have a good answer for it, because he's the one that does it, and I'm just glad I'm working with him.
Hey, so when you put the game up for sale initially, the one where you had no screenshots, you also put up the rule set or like a design document that read very much like a board game rule set.
Can you talk a little bit about that, why you chose to do that?
Yeah, so we weren't showing a screen shot, but I felt like the most important thing was the rules themselves. We were able to take advantage of the fact that the game had such a board game feel. I don't know how many board games I have that I read the rules but never actually played. So that is a phenomenon. People kind of understand what that's like. So I thought that they're probably the players that we wanted to get were people who would be good with that.
they'd be like, oh cool, there's a little bit of a small rule book for me to read, and that'll give me a sense of how the game plays, and I'll kind of like imagine it, and maybe I'll be off a little bit, but that'll like make me kind of want to get into the game.
I mean, I wanted to give them something, right?
We're not giving them a screenshot.
We gotta give them something.
Go ahead, thanks.
So I want to address one thing, the question about tutorials, one other thing we really focused on is in the UI, we really focused on trying to give all the information you needed when something happened.
You want to build a metal mine, you press the metal mine, we immediately show a line to the iron, we show a line to the aluminum.
Like, there's another half of it, which is, we try to make sure we always give people the information they need just when they need it in the game.
And so that's super important too, beyond tutorials.
you know, kind of more on the tutorial side. Did you feel like, you know, because the tutorials felt like they told a story and they had the mission segments to them. Do you feel like you got any pushback or lost any revenue opportunities by not having an actual official campaign?
So the campaign is that we have an off world is dynamic and it has what you call like a light story touch. There's characters. There's not really much of a story. Part of that is like if I had to write a story, it would be absolutely terrible. This is just not what I do. And I kind of wanted the freedom to develop a dynamic campaign that you could do that was replayable.
doesn't match a lot of players expectations for RTS. But I was already not matching anyone's expectations for RTS anyway. So I figured I might as well go for it. I think it's just kind of like we're a small team. We don't, seven or eight guys and we have various things that we're good at. That was just something that we absolutely were not good at.
I bet there's a lot of players who would get into the game if we had a more standard story-based campaign.
It's just something.
And actually, I think it's something that we're gonna get into.
There is a writer that we're working with now, writer slash designer, who I've worked with in various projects, who designed the Patron and Patriot DLC, which is a huge expansion of the campaign and did have a lot of story content for the new CEOs.
And so we're probably gonna continue working with him.
He's gonna backfill a lot of that story into the game.
So.
It's great to hear.
Thank you so much.
Yeah, cool, thanks.
Do you have any plans to port the game to console, like PS4?
Uhhh...
No, not right now.
But it's always possible.
I mean, so I did actually did a mapping to the console controller.
And, you know, it's okay, right?
But it's like it's an RTS.
It's really hard to pull off with a controller.
This is gonna like totally be a disaster if we ever decide, mark a disaster, I just said, if we ever have to sell it on the console.
But like, you know, doing, I mean, it could potentially work, right?
Like you're not controlling units, right?
So you could make it work on a console, you could make it work on a tablet, right?
I think there's good possibilities there.
I just think that you'd need to like, kind of like rebuild part of the game from the ground up.
So yeah, I mean, I do think about it.
Like, it'd be kind of a neat project to take on.
But unfortunately we don't have anything happening right now.
So, thanks.
Thank you.
Over there.
Okay, yeah I was just wondering, you created the game, this is your game.
Do you also help other people to build a game?
Are you for hire?
Wait, sorry, can you repeat that?
Okay, do you help other people create games?
Oh, do I help other people, you mean do I work on other teams or consult or that type of thing?
Is that what you mean?
I mean, not very much.
I mean, I've written a lot about game design.
I do a game design podcast, Designer Notes, where I talk to designers.
I mean, I try to spread game design information.
I mean, every once in a while, if there's a small project, I mean, I have taken on, like, work on something for a day or two if someone just wants some feedback on the game.
So, I mean, I am open to stuff like that.
But when I work on a game, I have a hard time even, I've never really even been able to work on two games at once, right?
Like, I talk to people who work on three or four games at the same time, and I find that amazing that anyone can do that.
But thanks.
Do you attribute the success of the game to being 3D versus being a 2D game?
I'm sorry, I couldn't help it.
The game is 3D.
Do you think that that was important for the game to be successful?
Was the point of it being 3D?
So when I first did the prototype, it was actually 2D, just because that was simple.
Well, it was like OpenGL, but like straight down, but functionally it was 2D.
And you could make it just 2D, but at this point I think the tools, the best tools out there are 3D tools, right?
Like we use Unity.
which was great to develop in.
Basically because it has amazing art tools.
Like our artists were immediately, I mean artists, I'm almost just artist, right?
Like the one main guy we had was able to become immediately five times as more productive as he had been before we jumped to Unity.
So, like, you know, 3D has gotten to the point where it's just very easy to develop in 3D, and if it was simpler to develop in 2D, I probably would do 2D.
I don't think there's anything fundamentally about it that would make it work one way or another.
My question is that with this game you're taking combat out of RTS.
Right.
You're playing with that notion. Are there any plans for Mohawk or you yourself to take on another genre and try to take out a core mechanic and see what you can do with it?
Well, that would that be our thing?
Once may be enough, it is a big challenge.
I'll say that.
Yeah, I mean, you know, I mean, to some extent, this comes to the question of what you should do as an independent developer, right?
Like, I love RTS games, but I'm never gonna be able to take on StarCraft as a small team, and that's just crazy, right?
So you have to do something radically different.
Right?
And so some of the games I showed you, like Adam Zombie Smash was a great game of like, that's an amazing RTS.
And you know, he just changed some of the basic assumptions about how an RTS worked, and was able to make a great game, and he wasn't competing against anyone else.
And so that's the same basic idea of what we're trying to do with Offworld.
So yeah, I mean, probably we'll always do that with games.
You know, like we're gonna have to figure out how to make something that no one else is making.
I mean, I think that's what you have to do as an independent developer.
Looking forward to the next experiment.
All right, thank you.
All right.
Whoops.
All right, looks like maybe one more.
Yeah, yeah.
Hello.
I figured out the question.
What do you think is the future of RTS?
The future of RTS.
You know, it's a hard question for me to answer because I'm kind of done with traditional RTS games.
I don't really find them particularly enjoyable anymore just because I play them so much.
So I hope the future of RTS games is more games like Offworld, right?
Which are like, what I want is to play a game that takes about 30 minutes, that's strategic and competitive and I can play with my friends, right?
That's what I want.
And Offworld delivers that in a way that's interesting.
And I don't want to do a Tank Rush anymore with my friends.
I want to do something different.
But I still love that format.
Just the basic idea of we're going to play this game over a lunch break, and we're going to have this ups and downs.
And after the game, getting together and talking about what happened is going to be amazing.
That's what I want out of an RTS game.
Is that going to happen? I don't know.
I think the traditional RTS is absolutely in danger.
And the big one there is because of MOBAs.
MOBAs have destroyed the traditional RTS game.
Because RTS games as they are, are kind of terrible.
you're asking a player to control 100 units spread all over the map and jump back and forth and pay attention to what they're doing and what all their opponents are doing.
And it's amazing those games ever worked at all.
Like MOBAs are just the micro aspect of an RTS.
And so that's why people are like, oh, this is really fun because now I actually feel like I can handle this game.
Off-world is just the macro aspect of an RTS.
You know, we dropped all the micro parts.
You don't have to worry about units.
And because, so we, there's two games in there, they're just half of a whole RTS, which is a sign of just how complex and overburdened those games tend to be.
So yeah, I don't think there's necessarily a big future for the traditional RTS, but I love the format.
like playing a strategic game with your friends, 30 minutes, up to eight players, something like that.
So I hope to see more.
Yeah, I agree.
Thank you.
All right, thanks.
All right, thanks for coming, everyone.
