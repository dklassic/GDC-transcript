1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,421
My name is Garrett Fredley. I'm a software engineer at Electronic Arts,

2
00:00:08,722 --> 00:00:10,703
and my work encompasses all that is preservation.

3
00:00:11,163 --> 00:00:13,284
I handle the preservation of some of our headlining sports titles,

4
00:00:13,884 --> 00:00:15,545
and I make it so that they can come back again one day,

5
00:00:15,645 --> 00:00:19,427
whether it be 10 years later, 30, 40, even 100 years.

6
00:00:19,647 --> 00:00:20,827
I make sure that that is possible.

7
00:00:22,248 --> 00:00:25,030
My initial role, though, while I do engineer work day-to-day,

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,770
I actually got my start developing tools,

9
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,392
developing tools specifically in the technical art space.

10
00:00:30,192 --> 00:00:32,033
So I kind of have experience with both making games

11
00:00:32,293 --> 00:00:35,495
and kind of doing weird preservation work with them.

12
00:00:36,684 --> 00:00:38,285
That is my background. That is what I do,

13
00:00:38,325 --> 00:00:42,068
and you will see soon how that actually plays into preservation.

14
00:00:42,088 --> 00:00:44,931
With that said, let us kick things off.

15
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:47,533
What is this thing called preservation?

16
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:48,934
Many of you probably know what it is.

17
00:00:48,974 --> 00:00:50,155
Some of you might even be doing it.

18
00:00:50,935 --> 00:00:52,016
Let us talk a little bit about it.

19
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:58,341
Preservation is, simply put, the process that puts a game away.

20
00:00:58,701 --> 00:00:59,802
All the things that went into the game,

21
00:01:00,363 --> 00:01:02,264
all the files, all the data, and all the documents,

22
00:01:02,584 --> 00:01:04,286
in such a way so that it can come back again.

23
00:01:05,428 --> 00:01:07,090
And many of you right now have seen

24
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,831
the direct success of preservation.

25
00:01:09,411 --> 00:01:10,712
Who here has seen any of these titles

26
00:01:10,732 --> 00:01:11,572
that are on the screen right now?

27
00:01:13,634 --> 00:01:15,695
Excellent, you have seen preservation success.

28
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:18,717
But preservation is not something that is always perfect,

29
00:01:19,077 --> 00:01:21,939
and there are stories of tragedy in the preservation space.

30
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,800
And we'll get into those in a little bit.

31
00:01:25,341 --> 00:01:27,483
But preservation is much more than simply

32
00:01:28,263 --> 00:01:29,124
this, what I just said.

33
00:01:29,644 --> 00:01:30,965
We see the end goal of it,

34
00:01:31,045 --> 00:01:32,306
but there's a lot that goes into this.

35
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:35,152
I actually want to expose what we at Electronic Arts do

36
00:01:35,493 --> 00:01:38,094
and what we look at preservation as in form of a maturity model.

37
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:41,957
And simply put, this will allow you to see where you sit

38
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,258
in the realm of preservation, at least from our eyes.

39
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:49,222
So let's open up this discussion with simply a Tier 1 archive.

40
00:01:49,942 --> 00:01:53,024
Now a Tier 1 archive is what we see as, take a box.

41
00:01:53,485 --> 00:01:55,826
Any box, it can be an SSD, it can be a hard drive,

42
00:01:55,886 --> 00:01:57,988
it can be anything you constitute as a box.

43
00:01:59,088 --> 00:02:01,790
You take all the things that comprise your game or your work,

44
00:02:02,362 --> 00:02:04,342
That can be the tools, that can be your data,

45
00:02:04,382 --> 00:02:06,283
that can be your code, and you simply

46
00:02:07,143 --> 00:02:10,004
merge the two together to form the archive.

47
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:12,425
Who here is doing this right now?

48
00:02:15,186 --> 00:02:16,907
Okay, some of you, that's awesome, that's a great start.

49
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:19,128
Now, some of you might see this and go,

50
00:02:19,288 --> 00:02:21,429
that's awfully familiar to what we call a backup,

51
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:23,269
and you're technically right, to a degree.

52
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,490
A backup is very similar to this,

53
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,111
and anyone who is currently doing a backup

54
00:02:27,171 --> 00:02:29,331
is already on their way, and that's excellent.

55
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:32,483
The difference between a backup and a tier one archive,

56
00:02:32,503 --> 00:02:36,006
at least to us, is that do you archive your documentation?

57
00:02:36,607 --> 00:02:37,588
What about your team photos?

58
00:02:38,168 --> 00:02:39,629
What about your server tech?

59
00:02:40,811 --> 00:02:42,912
How much do you preserve of the actual game

60
00:02:42,952 --> 00:02:44,614
besides just the content that built it?

61
00:02:46,055 --> 00:02:47,537
If you preserve the documentation as well

62
00:02:47,577 --> 00:02:48,898
and all those kind of auxiliary things,

63
00:02:49,718 --> 00:02:52,881
those are what makes this a tier one archive

64
00:02:52,921 --> 00:02:53,842
as opposed to a backup.

65
00:02:55,883 --> 00:02:57,864
But ultimately speaking, we want to preserve things

66
00:02:57,924 --> 00:03:00,165
because there is value in what we can bring them back for.

67
00:03:01,126 --> 00:03:02,546
This, while it is valuable

68
00:03:02,586 --> 00:03:04,487
because that is what the game was built as,

69
00:03:06,929 --> 00:03:08,490
you still have to have a familiar knowledge

70
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,230
with how to take this dump of stuff

71
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:12,372
and remake that game again with it.

72
00:03:13,532 --> 00:03:15,513
So the value in the Tier 1 archive is limited.

73
00:03:16,214 --> 00:03:18,475
So what we did is we said, what is the next step?

74
00:03:18,815 --> 00:03:21,516
What is the next tier of value that we can control with this?

75
00:03:22,437 --> 00:03:23,878
That led us to the Tier 2 archive.

76
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:26,127
Now, 2.0.2's archive starts a bit differently.

77
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:27,288
We actually start with a machine.

78
00:03:28,788 --> 00:03:30,209
We take the exact same things again,

79
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:32,650
but we do something a little bit different.

80
00:03:33,991 --> 00:03:35,471
We take those tools and we install them.

81
00:03:35,871 --> 00:03:36,572
We configure them.

82
00:03:37,212 --> 00:03:38,973
How would an artist use the artist software?

83
00:03:39,413 --> 00:03:41,314
How did a build engineer reproduce builds?

84
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:43,154
What software did they use? How was it configured?

85
00:03:43,895 --> 00:03:47,476
All of this needs to be done so that they can interface

86
00:03:47,516 --> 00:03:50,878
with this archive exactly how they would have in production.

87
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:55,880
The data, can this machine take a brand new piece of content

88
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:58,483
and inject it straight through the pipeline

89
00:03:59,143 --> 00:04:00,104
into a new build of the game?

90
00:04:01,806 --> 00:04:03,327
If you can, excellent.

91
00:04:04,628 --> 00:04:06,670
But can you also build a new release of the game?

92
00:04:07,611 --> 00:04:09,753
If you want to patch an archive title,

93
00:04:10,353 --> 00:04:12,435
let's say someone discovered a security flaw in your build,

94
00:04:12,936 --> 00:04:14,397
and 10 years later you're like, oh boy,

95
00:04:14,417 --> 00:04:15,278
we should get that fixed.

96
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,341
You need to be able to reproduce a patch with that archive.

97
00:04:20,764 --> 00:04:22,285
And there's many other things you would do with a Tier 2,

98
00:04:22,485 --> 00:04:24,845
but simply put, can you reproduce the game?

99
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,726
If you were to stand this machine up,

100
00:04:27,586 --> 00:04:29,687
could you produce a new release of the game,

101
00:04:29,947 --> 00:04:31,828
new content for the game, a new DLC for the game?

102
00:04:32,488 --> 00:04:33,928
That is what a Tier 2 archive is for.

103
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:39,290
But let's not forget, there is one specialty requirement

104
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,150
of a Tier 2 archive, something we probably

105
00:04:41,671 --> 00:04:43,151
would all fail to check for right now.

106
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:46,432
Can it all be done without any access to the internet?

107
00:04:48,948 --> 00:04:51,690
Who here says all their work would 100% function

108
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,290
without internet?

109
00:04:54,411 --> 00:04:54,852
Exactly.

110
00:04:56,132 --> 00:04:57,913
The point of an archive is so that this thing

111
00:04:57,933 --> 00:05:00,095
will function in let's say 50 years.

112
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,776
If you have internet access right now,

113
00:05:03,256 --> 00:05:05,438
you're probably interfacing with network shares,

114
00:05:06,118 --> 00:05:07,879
server, let's say server programs,

115
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,040
the works, maybe domain accounts.

116
00:05:11,461 --> 00:05:12,782
If you turn your machine off,

117
00:05:13,262 --> 00:05:15,863
you prove can this work independently amongst itself?

118
00:05:17,758 --> 00:05:19,219
That is the ultimate verification step

119
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:20,699
for a Tier 2 archive,

120
00:05:20,739 --> 00:05:23,560
and it is obviously speaking quite difficult to do,

121
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,242
but it is a valuable step because this truly allows us

122
00:05:26,282 --> 00:05:27,682
to push the game further.

123
00:05:30,123 --> 00:05:31,804
Now that is Tier 2, and a lot of the time,

124
00:05:32,344 --> 00:05:34,805
we at Electronic Arts are able to get to this point.

125
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,907
But even for us, it is a very, very challenging thing to do.

126
00:05:37,927 --> 00:05:40,548
A Tier 2 archive is not easy, as one can imagine.

127
00:05:41,668 --> 00:05:42,809
So we try and aim for Tier 2,

128
00:05:43,049 --> 00:05:44,430
but a lot of the time we do end up at Tier 1.

129
00:05:46,371 --> 00:05:48,052
But like anything else, and many tools developers

130
00:05:48,092 --> 00:05:50,693
in this room will know, we want to go to the magnum opus.

131
00:05:50,793 --> 00:05:51,934
We want to get to the end goal,

132
00:05:51,974 --> 00:05:54,875
the greatest possible method of this as we can.

133
00:05:55,776 --> 00:05:58,337
So we formed what I like to call the Mythical Tier.

134
00:05:59,478 --> 00:06:02,119
The Mythical Tier starts the same way as a Tier 2 archive.

135
00:06:02,219 --> 00:06:05,961
You get a machine. You get the same things of the game.

136
00:06:08,042 --> 00:06:09,923
But do you use online services?

137
00:06:11,724 --> 00:06:13,465
All of those need to be preserved as well.

138
00:06:14,724 --> 00:06:16,565
Now let me hit home how complicated this is.

139
00:06:17,725 --> 00:06:19,366
For instance, if your game runs on a server,

140
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:23,427
can this machine run a local server that you were using

141
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,088
and can it connect to that server?

142
00:06:25,108 --> 00:06:26,748
Can you run a client and connect to your server?

143
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:28,749
Okay, that's stage one.

144
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:29,809
If you can, awesome.

145
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,070
Stage two, most people have gone their builds

146
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,471
to a distribution service.

147
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:35,911
For instance, we use Origin.

148
00:06:37,072 --> 00:06:39,553
Could you localize Origin so that you could technically

149
00:06:39,593 --> 00:06:41,393
build a new build of game with this,

150
00:06:42,114 --> 00:06:43,294
run it through Origin locally,

151
00:06:43,772 --> 00:06:47,335
and use Origin to distribute it again with that single machine.

152
00:06:48,856 --> 00:06:51,258
Do you have metrics gathering tools, analysis tools?

153
00:06:51,838 --> 00:06:55,381
The list goes on and on. If you can get this archived,

154
00:06:55,981 --> 00:06:57,783
you have truly achieved mythical progress.

155
00:06:58,703 --> 00:07:00,445
But that is incredibly difficult to do.

156
00:07:01,986 --> 00:07:04,088
In Electronic Arts, we strive to try to reach this model,

157
00:07:04,128 --> 00:07:05,168
but it is not simple.

158
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,651
And those are the three tiers of archiving.

159
00:07:08,671 --> 00:07:11,553
Those are the three tiers of where we believe people sit

160
00:07:11,993 --> 00:07:13,475
in kind of the grand scheme of archiving.

161
00:07:15,123 --> 00:07:16,564
If you currently sit kind of close to Tier 1

162
00:07:16,664 --> 00:07:18,425
or even in Tier 1, excellent.

163
00:07:18,565 --> 00:07:20,506
If you're just sitting just before Tier 1,

164
00:07:20,687 --> 00:07:22,908
we're not doing documentation, push a little bit more.

165
00:07:23,508 --> 00:07:25,089
It'll feel really good when you can look back and say,

166
00:07:25,109 --> 00:07:27,351
wow, we built this 15 years ago. This is incredible.

167
00:07:28,892 --> 00:07:30,933
If you're sitting at Tier 2, awesome.

168
00:07:31,414 --> 00:07:33,555
Let's have a conversation. I'd love to see how you're doing it.

169
00:07:34,616 --> 00:07:36,457
If you're at Tier 3, I have a lot of questions for you.

170
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:40,640
Now, that's preservation as a concept.

171
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,921
Let's see what Electronic Arts does.

172
00:07:42,101 --> 00:07:44,242
Let's talk about preservation at Electronic Arts.

173
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,085
So Electronic Arts, many of you know us.

174
00:07:47,845 --> 00:07:49,046
You probably heard our names in the news.

175
00:07:50,346 --> 00:07:53,567
And simply put, we have about 35-plus years of titles,

176
00:07:54,388 --> 00:07:57,609
both archived and analyzed for decades.

177
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:00,530
What's great is this both allows us to see

178
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,251
how games as a medium has grown over those years,

179
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:05,472
but also how has preservation grown?

180
00:08:05,992 --> 00:08:08,293
How has preservation grown since, let's say,

181
00:08:08,313 --> 00:08:10,333
the early 80s as opposed to now?

182
00:08:10,874 --> 00:08:11,894
Probably quite a lot.

183
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:16,739
but I would be doing an injustice to games

184
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:18,240
if I did not talk about how big they are.

185
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,221
Who here works as a game developer?

186
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:26,343
Who here knows fully well the complete size

187
00:08:26,403 --> 00:08:27,984
of everything you built for your project?

188
00:08:29,765 --> 00:08:30,825
Perfect, some of you, that is awesome.

189
00:08:31,566 --> 00:08:32,666
It is a rare question to ask,

190
00:08:32,766 --> 00:08:34,687
because if I asked you how big your game is,

191
00:08:34,707 --> 00:08:36,548
let us say for Electronic Arts,

192
00:08:37,128 --> 00:08:40,129
we have these monolithic numbers of builds released daily.

193
00:08:41,658 --> 00:08:42,919
you output a lot of data,

194
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:44,300
and we're talking about preservation,

195
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,921
and we look at something like this,

196
00:08:46,421 --> 00:08:48,203
we wonder how are we supposed to preserve that?

197
00:08:48,563 --> 00:08:50,804
In what right mind do we preserve that?

198
00:08:50,824 --> 00:08:53,366
And that is an extremely important question

199
00:08:53,406 --> 00:08:54,327
to us at Electronic Arts.

200
00:08:55,187 --> 00:08:57,329
But simply put, there is not one person to do it.

201
00:08:57,929 --> 00:08:59,471
In fact, we have three groups I like to see

202
00:09:00,071 --> 00:09:02,933
as the responsible partners for the preservation process.

203
00:09:03,573 --> 00:09:05,155
Let's kind of look at those three partners.

204
00:09:06,656 --> 00:09:08,617
The first part are the content creators.

205
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,704
The content creators are the programmers, the artists,

206
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:13,005
the animators, the producers,

207
00:09:13,045 --> 00:09:14,365
the ones who really just make the game.

208
00:09:16,026 --> 00:09:19,588
They are also in charge, not solely of just making the game,

209
00:09:20,249 --> 00:09:22,630
how can they better the process of archiving?

210
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,951
Can they embed tools in their workflow

211
00:09:25,391 --> 00:09:27,453
that make the archiver's job easier?

212
00:09:28,393 --> 00:09:29,554
So they do have a hand in this,

213
00:09:29,614 --> 00:09:30,814
but they ultimately create the game,

214
00:09:31,495 --> 00:09:32,595
and now it needs to be preserved.

215
00:09:33,236 --> 00:09:33,896
So who does that?

216
00:09:34,536 --> 00:09:35,657
Who handles preservation?

217
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:40,121
At Electronic Arts, we don't technically have a single,

218
00:09:40,261 --> 00:09:41,262
sole archiving team.

219
00:09:41,362 --> 00:09:43,484
We have many people from both game teams themselves

220
00:09:43,964 --> 00:09:46,887
or technology teams like myself who are responsible

221
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:49,649
for performing the process of archiving.

222
00:09:50,469 --> 00:09:53,292
And so we kind of call them archivists and preservationists.

223
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,314
Now the archivists and preservationists

224
00:09:56,394 --> 00:09:58,135
are solely responsible for taking all that built,

225
00:09:58,676 --> 00:09:59,817
all that went into building the game,

226
00:10:00,277 --> 00:10:02,499
all the tools and software that they used to preserve the game

227
00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:05,921
and using that to produce an archive.

228
00:10:06,705 --> 00:10:08,466
whether that be in tier 1, tier 2, tier 3,

229
00:10:08,526 --> 00:10:10,047
or some other unknown tier.

230
00:10:11,087 --> 00:10:12,488
They are responsible for that process.

231
00:10:13,969 --> 00:10:16,310
As you can imagine, we'll dig quite a bit into this

232
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:17,871
and just see what this actually looks like,

233
00:10:18,671 --> 00:10:20,532
but these are the folks who really dig into that.

234
00:10:21,753 --> 00:10:24,054
What happens next? Who does archiving after that?

235
00:10:24,254 --> 00:10:26,055
To simply put, you can't just archive a game

236
00:10:26,095 --> 00:10:27,276
and leave it in a box somewhere.

237
00:10:28,697 --> 00:10:31,018
So we have a dedicated team who manage the archives.

238
00:10:31,338 --> 00:10:32,399
They're the preservation managers.

239
00:10:33,239 --> 00:10:35,861
They are the team responsible for, where do I put this?

240
00:10:36,813 --> 00:10:38,254
And how can it survive for 100 years?

241
00:10:39,955 --> 00:10:41,736
What happens if the entire server goes down

242
00:10:41,796 --> 00:10:42,957
and all of our archives get lost?

243
00:10:43,117 --> 00:10:44,238
Do we have backups?

244
00:10:44,998 --> 00:10:45,799
How do we maintain them?

245
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:48,601
Are we able to see technology grow and still say

246
00:10:48,641 --> 00:10:50,322
that these archives are functional?

247
00:10:51,423 --> 00:10:53,444
They're the maintenance people of these archives.

248
00:10:54,885 --> 00:10:57,106
And these are the final holders of those archives.

249
00:10:59,071 --> 00:11:01,472
Now, many of you probably have either a small department

250
00:11:01,532 --> 00:11:03,032
or just a few people who handle archiving.

251
00:11:03,713 --> 00:11:05,934
And as you grow, you'll notice that the requirements

252
00:11:05,954 --> 00:11:07,514
of archiving become so great

253
00:11:07,554 --> 00:11:09,375
that this model becomes more reasonable.

254
00:11:12,776 --> 00:11:14,197
But what is actually goes into archiving?

255
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:16,517
I've talked a lot about archiving the concept,

256
00:11:17,378 --> 00:11:19,399
the teams that handle it. I want to dig in.

257
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:21,219
I want to reveal exactly what I do day-to-day

258
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:22,660
to preserve any one of our games.

259
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,581
So let's talk about the tasks of preservation.

260
00:11:26,962 --> 00:11:29,403
I'm gonna go over exactly what a tier two archive looks like

261
00:11:29,744 --> 00:11:30,424
at Electronic Arts.

262
00:11:32,045 --> 00:11:34,646
And it always starts the same way, this setup.

263
00:11:35,867 --> 00:11:37,928
The setup simply starts with research.

264
00:11:38,328 --> 00:11:39,449
Who here loves research?

265
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,190
All right, I appreciate it.

266
00:11:43,671 --> 00:11:45,412
Research is absolutely the most important thing.

267
00:11:45,892 --> 00:11:46,592
As I mentioned before,

268
00:11:46,632 --> 00:11:48,133
the archivists and preservationists group,

269
00:11:48,253 --> 00:11:49,894
they don't always work directly on the title.

270
00:11:50,574 --> 00:11:52,315
They are sometimes a technologist like myself.

271
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,421
We do not have familiarity with the title,

272
00:11:55,662 --> 00:11:57,623
so how would we be the best ones to reproduce

273
00:11:57,663 --> 00:11:59,224
the environment for a title?

274
00:12:00,305 --> 00:12:01,506
This gives us that information.

275
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:03,948
Go through all the documentation you can find,

276
00:12:04,008 --> 00:12:05,249
speak with some members of the teams,

277
00:12:05,669 --> 00:12:06,570
and gather the information.

278
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,171
Do you know what SDKs the game were built on?

279
00:12:08,371 --> 00:12:11,173
What about the platforms? What technologies did they use?

280
00:12:11,253 --> 00:12:14,235
How was their builds produced? What game engine did they use?

281
00:12:14,335 --> 00:12:15,616
The list can go on and on and on.

282
00:12:16,597 --> 00:12:17,758
Ultimately, this is just to gather

283
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,259
and make you as prepared as you can be

284
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:20,000
for what you're about to do.

285
00:12:22,028 --> 00:12:24,049
What comes next is getting the hardware for this.

286
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,751
As one can imagine, as I mentioned before,

287
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,732
and especially those who know how big their games are,

288
00:12:30,452 --> 00:12:31,932
you're gonna need a lot of hardware for this.

289
00:12:32,673 --> 00:12:35,694
Simply, you need terabytes and terabytes of storage data

290
00:12:36,294 --> 00:12:37,655
for this process.

291
00:12:38,195 --> 00:12:39,255
And it's taking understanding,

292
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:41,196
and this is actually gathered in the first part,

293
00:12:42,437 --> 00:12:44,117
you need to understand how big your game is first

294
00:12:44,157 --> 00:12:45,058
before you request this.

295
00:12:45,738 --> 00:12:47,859
So once you have all these crazy machines set up,

296
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:50,240
you have all these terabytes of data or of hardware,

297
00:12:52,046 --> 00:12:52,766
Let's get them set up.

298
00:12:53,786 --> 00:12:55,487
Now, this step is completely impossible

299
00:12:55,747 --> 00:12:56,647
if you do not do your research.

300
00:12:57,627 --> 00:13:00,288
How did an artist interface and build content for the game?

301
00:13:01,588 --> 00:13:02,788
Does anyone of you in this room

302
00:13:02,888 --> 00:13:04,429
know how to do everything possible

303
00:13:04,469 --> 00:13:05,469
to remake the game from scratch?

304
00:13:07,609 --> 00:13:08,110
Probably not.

305
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,390
Some of you are like,

306
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,150
I know quite a bit about it, and that's awesome.

307
00:13:12,311 --> 00:13:13,531
As you grow and your game gets bigger,

308
00:13:13,631 --> 00:13:16,631
this becomes inconceivable to be able to do everything.

309
00:13:17,621 --> 00:13:19,443
So work with your artists, work with your programmers,

310
00:13:19,843 --> 00:13:21,044
get the machine set up,

311
00:13:21,224 --> 00:13:22,365
maybe even ask them to play with it.

312
00:13:23,646 --> 00:13:25,387
Once you have all the software installed,

313
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:28,790
you've successively set up,

314
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:31,012
now you can move on to stage two.

315
00:13:32,073 --> 00:13:32,573
Requisition.

316
00:13:34,135 --> 00:13:35,976
Requisition's a short phase, technically,

317
00:13:37,097 --> 00:13:38,438
but it all starts out with the same way.

318
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,360
Acquire absolutely everything,

319
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,482
literally everything you can find.

320
00:13:43,602 --> 00:13:45,404
Now, this is awesome and easy,

321
00:13:46,045 --> 00:13:47,526
if your data was stored in the same place.

322
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:51,669
That is a dream and that does not happen in the real world.

323
00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:53,190
Most likely people will store it

324
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,691
maybe on the main Perforce server or the Git server,

325
00:13:56,352 --> 00:13:57,933
but some people will store it in their OneDrive,

326
00:13:57,953 --> 00:13:59,194
they'll store it on their local desktop,

327
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:00,214
which is truly the worst.

328
00:14:01,515 --> 00:14:03,016
People will not always store it the same way.

329
00:14:03,036 --> 00:14:05,698
So do your due diligence, scan through everything,

330
00:14:06,258 --> 00:14:08,180
you will eventually find all that you need to find.

331
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,081
Get that onto these machines.

332
00:14:13,023 --> 00:14:14,624
Now get it to a local SCM server.

333
00:14:15,377 --> 00:14:16,678
SCM just stands for version control.

334
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:20,301
If you use Perforce, get all that data onto Perforce.

335
00:14:20,841 --> 00:14:23,223
If you were to use this archive to operate upon that data,

336
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:26,226
you have effectively altered the data

337
00:14:26,246 --> 00:14:28,147
that was used in production. You do not want to do that.

338
00:14:29,448 --> 00:14:30,910
You need the original files

339
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,031
because that is what the production people used.

340
00:14:33,632 --> 00:14:36,855
If you toy with it, you've rendered it not production ready,

341
00:14:37,115 --> 00:14:38,976
or you've rendered it not exactly what they did.

342
00:14:40,758 --> 00:14:42,499
Get it onto local server so you can make copies with it,

343
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:43,440
and you can play with those copies.

344
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,331
And it's also better to have multiple copies than one.

345
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:49,233
Once you've done that, great.

346
00:14:49,273 --> 00:14:49,894
You have everything.

347
00:14:49,914 --> 00:14:51,155
The machine's set up to do stuff.

348
00:14:51,495 --> 00:14:52,055
Let's do stuff.

349
00:14:52,796 --> 00:14:53,316
Reproduction.

350
00:14:54,437 --> 00:14:56,118
Reproduction is truly the longest step

351
00:14:56,518 --> 00:14:58,180
because of this first step.

352
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,441
Reproduce every release.

353
00:15:01,982 --> 00:15:04,084
In many games, and especially in the larger AAA companies,

354
00:15:05,101 --> 00:15:06,841
they will have a lot of releases.

355
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:10,242
Alpha, beta, final, that model is pretty much standard.

356
00:15:10,882 --> 00:15:13,703
Then you have patches one through X, DLC one through X.

357
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,163
Perhaps you'll even have variants of them.

358
00:15:16,243 --> 00:15:18,523
For instance, if you release a Japanese version of the game,

359
00:15:18,943 --> 00:15:20,444
that's probably a wholly separate build

360
00:15:21,024 --> 00:15:22,604
than the English version or the Brazilian version.

361
00:15:23,864 --> 00:15:25,205
What do you need in 10 years?

362
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,345
What do you think the people will need in 30 years?

363
00:15:28,245 --> 00:15:29,925
Every possible release has to be verified

364
00:15:29,945 --> 00:15:32,166
that can be produced by these archived machines.

365
00:15:33,894 --> 00:15:35,435
Probably a lot to ask of a person.

366
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:37,876
And so to give you a figure,

367
00:15:38,276 --> 00:15:42,317
if I for instance asked you to do 10 patches per region,

368
00:15:42,337 --> 00:15:44,378
let's say you have six regions, per release,

369
00:15:44,418 --> 00:15:45,439
let's say there's eight releases,

370
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:48,920
that's probably a lot of build you need to verify.

371
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,901
So it helps to make sure this machine

372
00:15:51,941 --> 00:15:53,662
is quite capable of doing it all again.

373
00:15:54,902 --> 00:15:55,843
But that's not everything though.

374
00:15:56,683 --> 00:15:58,284
Obviously this machine needs to be able to function

375
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,385
and create new stuff, not just reproduce the old.

376
00:16:00,405 --> 00:16:03,526
It reproduces all the content as well.

377
00:16:04,843 --> 00:16:06,123
This means taking an audio file,

378
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,083
putting it through the pipeline,

379
00:16:07,123 --> 00:16:08,783
and getting it into a new build of the game.

380
00:16:09,324 --> 00:16:11,844
Ask an audio artist, or an artist, or an effects artist.

381
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,344
Make these new content files on this machine.

382
00:16:15,525 --> 00:16:18,145
If they can, great. They should feel at home.

383
00:16:18,385 --> 00:16:20,165
They worked on this game, they can work on this machine.

384
00:16:20,406 --> 00:16:21,626
That's perfect. Match made in heaven.

385
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:24,626
That is an important step.

386
00:16:25,046 --> 00:16:27,267
And remember, there's a lot of realms of content,

387
00:16:27,307 --> 00:16:28,887
so don't just associate art and audio

388
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,207
as the only two parts of content.

389
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:30,927
There's a lot.

390
00:16:32,648 --> 00:16:33,108
And lastly.

391
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:34,813
You got to verify it.

392
00:16:35,153 --> 00:16:36,474
Remember, you're not doing this for yourself.

393
00:16:36,654 --> 00:16:40,037
The person in 30 years from now is going to be opening this.

394
00:16:40,117 --> 00:16:41,618
You probably might not be at the company

395
00:16:41,638 --> 00:16:42,839
or you may be somewhere else at the time.

396
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,301
Do your due diligence, verify everything.

397
00:16:45,962 --> 00:16:48,764
What I like to do, get a build onto a console.

398
00:16:49,665 --> 00:16:51,146
If you produced a new, I don't know,

399
00:16:51,186 --> 00:16:54,569
patch 18 build or whatever, get that onto the console

400
00:16:54,869 --> 00:16:55,730
and verify that it runs.

401
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,511
If you've created a new asset,

402
00:16:57,551 --> 00:16:58,632
let's say you made a new character,

403
00:16:59,813 --> 00:17:00,834
get the character into a build,

404
00:17:01,194 --> 00:17:02,115
get the build onto a console.

405
00:17:02,845 --> 00:17:04,387
That is probably the best stress test

406
00:17:04,587 --> 00:17:07,049
of the reproduction stage as you can get.

407
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:11,833
And so once you've done all that, you've done everything,

408
00:17:12,033 --> 00:17:13,414
this machine is pretty much perfect.

409
00:17:13,934 --> 00:17:15,676
You're probably tired, you wanna go home.

410
00:17:17,257 --> 00:17:18,478
Let's get it submitted, and you can.

411
00:17:18,498 --> 00:17:22,421
So submission starts off with cataloging.

412
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,743
I know, you probably haven't heard that word in a long time.

413
00:17:24,763 --> 00:17:28,326
At Electronic Arts, we have this great tool that we use

414
00:17:28,686 --> 00:17:30,928
that allows us to catalog everything.

415
00:17:32,441 --> 00:17:34,262
It's a tool that we use so that it can be accessible

416
00:17:34,302 --> 00:17:35,582
by any developer at any time.

417
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:37,783
It is filled in by the archivers,

418
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:41,145
and it's able to depict details about what was archived.

419
00:17:41,925 --> 00:17:43,866
For instance, if we made a title in 2001,

420
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:45,327
we can say, what was archived?

421
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,648
What was put in that machine?

422
00:17:46,688 --> 00:17:47,848
What tools did they use at the time?

423
00:17:48,628 --> 00:17:50,149
Instead of dredging up that machine again,

424
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,230
I can just look at this web page.

425
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,191
That's all I need to do.

426
00:17:53,211 --> 00:17:56,492
I highly recommend, if any of you are really investing

427
00:17:56,512 --> 00:17:58,353
in the archiving space, get a catalog up.

428
00:17:59,433 --> 00:18:00,534
People actually really want to see that.

429
00:18:01,422 --> 00:18:02,282
For those artists in the room,

430
00:18:02,302 --> 00:18:04,444
wouldn't you want to see what you did five years ago?

431
00:18:05,064 --> 00:18:07,025
See the original files, maybe even play with them again?

432
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:08,106
It'd be cool.

433
00:18:09,627 --> 00:18:10,928
Once you've done that, you cataloged everything,

434
00:18:12,189 --> 00:18:13,770
submit it, send your final email,

435
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,110
get it to the responsible parties

436
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:17,012
who manage these archives.

437
00:18:17,552 --> 00:18:19,934
They'll most likely perform their own verification.

438
00:18:20,354 --> 00:18:21,495
Two-sided verification's perfect.

439
00:18:21,515 --> 00:18:22,375
You don't want to just have you

440
00:18:22,415 --> 00:18:23,956
be the final person to verify.

441
00:18:24,977 --> 00:18:25,437
Once it's done.

442
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,501
transfer it to their final storage place.

443
00:18:28,581 --> 00:18:31,283
Mostly with us, we try to do a cloning.

444
00:18:31,363 --> 00:18:34,285
We'll clone the actual machines into our final storage

445
00:18:35,346 --> 00:18:37,548
so that what you have is merely a copy.

446
00:18:38,989 --> 00:18:40,690
With that copy, and you've got it stored,

447
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,431
your game is done, everything's been archived,

448
00:18:43,112 --> 00:18:43,712
destroy everything.

449
00:18:44,413 --> 00:18:45,794
Everything you just did for months and months,

450
00:18:46,214 --> 00:18:46,735
just trash it.

451
00:18:47,755 --> 00:18:48,976
It's been cloned, it's been put away,

452
00:18:50,097 --> 00:18:51,058
destroy all your machines,

453
00:18:51,558 --> 00:18:54,100
put the hardware back into the pool, you're done.

454
00:18:55,915 --> 00:18:56,816
And that's a tier two archive.

455
00:18:58,757 --> 00:19:00,478
Who feels they're ready to do this right now?

456
00:19:05,241 --> 00:19:05,641
Probably not.

457
00:19:06,221 --> 00:19:09,043
This is difficult and it's very, very time consuming.

458
00:19:10,764 --> 00:19:11,944
But I believe all of you probably can

459
00:19:12,425 --> 00:19:13,945
if you look into it and you try.

460
00:19:15,686 --> 00:19:19,048
However, we weren't able to get this right away.

461
00:19:19,689 --> 00:19:22,430
This tier, especially not tier three, but this tier.

462
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:24,680
was very, very difficult to get to.

463
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,301
And it wasn't just one person saying,

464
00:19:26,401 --> 00:19:27,841
I'll do archiving, this can be easy.

465
00:19:28,662 --> 00:19:31,884
It spent years of conversations and discussions

466
00:19:32,164 --> 00:19:34,345
to convince people that this is important.

467
00:19:35,385 --> 00:19:37,146
It wasn't until we created a cultural change

468
00:19:38,147 --> 00:19:39,788
and got the team on board with this,

469
00:19:40,748 --> 00:19:41,749
that it finally started.

470
00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:44,890
And all that always starts with the same thing.

471
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:46,731
Why do we archive?

472
00:19:47,171 --> 00:19:49,373
Why do we put so much time and money and thought

473
00:19:49,893 --> 00:19:50,933
into preserving what we've done?

474
00:19:52,126 --> 00:19:54,807
So we'll simply put, there's a lot of reasons we archive.

475
00:19:55,787 --> 00:19:56,827
For remastering purposes,

476
00:19:57,447 --> 00:20:00,168
if we want to bring it up into a legal matter, for patching,

477
00:20:00,528 --> 00:20:02,469
if, for instance, again, security flaws found,

478
00:20:02,509 --> 00:20:03,309
you could patch your game.

479
00:20:03,989 --> 00:20:06,350
You want to analyze what tools were available

480
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,130
by our competitors as opposed to this thing

481
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,331
we built 10 years ago.

482
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:12,091
Once you have a fundamental understanding

483
00:20:12,131 --> 00:20:14,312
of all the realms archiving can play in,

484
00:20:15,772 --> 00:20:17,213
you've created a great foundation

485
00:20:17,533 --> 00:20:19,013
for the reasoning behind archiving.

486
00:20:20,516 --> 00:20:22,718
But I really doubt that just showing,

487
00:20:22,738 --> 00:20:24,819
let's say, an executive producer or a lead,

488
00:20:25,139 --> 00:20:27,221
the people who can make those decisions to adopt this,

489
00:20:27,942 --> 00:20:28,762
this is not enough for them.

490
00:20:29,523 --> 00:20:30,904
They want cold, hard facts,

491
00:20:31,424 --> 00:20:33,165
and they will come at you with cold, hard questions.

492
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,887
Let's talk about a really common one,

493
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:37,649
who here has heard this question before,

494
00:20:38,349 --> 00:20:40,451
or even yourselves have said this before.

495
00:20:43,162 --> 00:20:44,583
You probably have seen this question said,

496
00:20:45,304 --> 00:20:47,065
and it's totally fair, it's absolutely fine.

497
00:20:47,445 --> 00:20:49,046
You may never want to remaster your game.

498
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:51,288
It may be something that's just not applicable to your work.

499
00:20:52,469 --> 00:20:54,710
But I highly doubt that these titles

500
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,991
and these companies thought the same way.

501
00:20:57,773 --> 00:20:59,734
Do you think when StarCraft was made

502
00:20:59,754 --> 00:21:00,475
that they were like, oh yeah,

503
00:21:00,535 --> 00:21:02,036
we're gonna release this again in like 15 years?

504
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:03,517
Probably not.

505
00:21:04,658 --> 00:21:06,219
Even Dark Souls, it wasn't released

506
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,101
that long ago in perspective.

507
00:21:10,161 --> 00:21:11,863
I really doubt that they thought that as well.

508
00:21:13,034 --> 00:21:15,195
It's normal for companies not to think of archiving.

509
00:21:15,676 --> 00:21:17,737
Premasters are not a thing you typically think about.

510
00:21:17,757 --> 00:21:21,539
That's not the only thing leads will come at you with.

511
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:22,900
Again, they have a list of questions.

512
00:21:24,581 --> 00:21:25,321
It's too expensive.

513
00:21:26,602 --> 00:21:27,262
It is expensive.

514
00:21:27,722 --> 00:21:28,923
You have to dedicate someone to it.

515
00:21:29,023 --> 00:21:29,984
You have to make sure it's good.

516
00:21:30,004 --> 00:21:31,344
There's quality checks involved.

517
00:21:31,765 --> 00:21:33,105
The bigger you get, the harder it'll be.

518
00:21:33,806 --> 00:21:34,486
It is expensive.

519
00:21:36,147 --> 00:21:37,148
But it's also, it pays off.

520
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:40,451
Let's talk Spyro, for example.

521
00:21:40,912 --> 00:21:41,612
I love the headline.

522
00:21:41,632 --> 00:21:42,692
There's actually a headline that says,

523
00:21:42,752 --> 00:21:45,693
this little purple dragon flies in the top chart in the UK.

524
00:21:47,433 --> 00:21:50,334
Spyro the remaster topped the UK sales charts.

525
00:21:50,554 --> 00:21:53,355
So much so, it actually beat out Red Redemption 2.

526
00:21:55,796 --> 00:21:57,896
A title that was going for game of the year that year

527
00:21:58,096 --> 00:22:00,397
was beat out by Spyro, a remaster.

528
00:22:02,944 --> 00:22:04,405
There are facts like this and it's normal.

529
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,666
Let's talk about Resident Evil, the HD's remaster.

530
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:11,648
It was the fastest selling digital game

531
00:22:11,668 --> 00:22:14,170
that Capcom has ever made at the time.

532
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,810
I think Monster Hunter now just beat it out.

533
00:22:17,151 --> 00:22:17,691
But think about that.

534
00:22:19,112 --> 00:22:21,953
Two examples of a remastered title topping sales charts.

535
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:23,714
They've effectively made their money back twice.

536
00:22:25,775 --> 00:22:27,756
That's some pretty good income if I say so myself.

537
00:22:31,658 --> 00:22:32,298
Rothman is speaking.

538
00:22:35,151 --> 00:22:35,831
We got to go further.

539
00:22:36,552 --> 00:22:39,133
We have to do more, push even harder to convince people.

540
00:22:40,154 --> 00:22:41,014
So I have three suggestions.

541
00:22:41,814 --> 00:22:42,775
These are high level suggestions

542
00:22:42,815 --> 00:22:44,196
and I want you to think about it in your own work.

543
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:47,137
You got to first create the realization,

544
00:22:47,717 --> 00:22:48,978
what happens if you don't preserve?

545
00:22:49,999 --> 00:22:51,379
What is the dark side of preservation?

546
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,180
Let me share some stories.

547
00:22:53,661 --> 00:22:55,121
Who here has heard of Blade Runner, the game?

548
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:59,023
That's actually more than I expected, awesome.

549
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,462
So Blender in a game, more people know about the movie,

550
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:03,823
but there's a game made years ago.

551
00:23:03,843 --> 00:23:05,744
And it was a wonderfully made game.

552
00:23:05,764 --> 00:23:07,305
It had a really solid cult following.

553
00:23:08,205 --> 00:23:09,606
During their liquidation and their move

554
00:23:09,646 --> 00:23:11,347
from Las Vegas to Los Angeles,

555
00:23:12,188 --> 00:23:14,890
big magnetic platters or hard drives

556
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,611
that held the game completely vanished.

557
00:23:17,951 --> 00:23:19,112
They lost everything.

558
00:23:20,593 --> 00:23:23,015
Everything that comprised that title went missing.

559
00:23:24,656 --> 00:23:25,276
Let me hit this home.

560
00:23:25,816 --> 00:23:26,797
In an interview with Gearbox

561
00:23:26,817 --> 00:23:28,098
when they wanted to trade the rights over,

562
00:23:30,105 --> 00:23:32,627
What do you think the number was estimated as

563
00:23:32,647 --> 00:23:33,428
to replace that data?

564
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:36,511
$40 million.

565
00:23:38,592 --> 00:23:40,234
$40 million worth of content lost.

566
00:23:41,555 --> 00:23:43,316
As you can imagine, the franchise died

567
00:23:43,596 --> 00:23:45,358
and there is no possibility of a remaster.

568
00:23:45,838 --> 00:23:47,099
You'd have to remake it from scratch.

569
00:23:49,241 --> 00:23:51,503
But many of you don't know Blade Runner and that's fair.

570
00:23:52,403 --> 00:23:54,445
Let's talk about an example we probably all know about.

571
00:23:55,286 --> 00:23:56,406
Who's here heard of StarCraft?

572
00:23:58,811 --> 00:24:00,012
Probably a bit more of you.

573
00:24:01,253 --> 00:24:03,534
So we think that AAA titles are impervious

574
00:24:03,694 --> 00:24:05,295
to the issues of preservation.

575
00:24:05,856 --> 00:24:07,417
No one is impervious to this.

576
00:24:08,517 --> 00:24:10,419
StarCraft, and actually you can go look up yourself,

577
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:12,040
an interview with the art director

578
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,882
during when they were doing the HD remaster of StarCraft,

579
00:24:16,242 --> 00:24:19,204
it was figured out that we lost all the art content.

580
00:24:21,106 --> 00:24:21,606
What do we do?

581
00:24:22,407 --> 00:24:23,327
And actually he states,

582
00:24:24,168 --> 00:24:25,849
I had to tell my artist to eyeball

583
00:24:26,489 --> 00:24:27,770
everything back into existence.

584
00:24:28,537 --> 00:24:31,179
using YouTube videos, copies of the game,

585
00:24:31,899 --> 00:24:32,840
and photographs off Google.

586
00:24:34,521 --> 00:24:35,821
I wonder how expensive that was.

587
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,784
So yes, this affects every domain.

588
00:24:39,804 --> 00:24:42,205
But let me really hit this home,

589
00:24:42,245 --> 00:24:44,026
because while those are matters of things

590
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:45,447
just straight up not being preserved,

591
00:24:46,807 --> 00:24:49,209
even if you do preserve, you can still run into trouble.

592
00:24:50,009 --> 00:24:50,990
Who here has heard of Silent Hill?

593
00:24:52,611 --> 00:24:53,491
Oh yes, the list goes on.

594
00:24:54,913 --> 00:24:57,215
Silent Hill is a title that was preserved.

595
00:24:57,315 --> 00:25:00,277
They did do their job. The problem is that,

596
00:25:00,477 --> 00:25:02,018
and again, once an interview with the director,

597
00:25:02,078 --> 00:25:03,099
they'd love to talk about this stuff.

598
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,341
An interview with the director, it was stated that,

599
00:25:07,222 --> 00:25:09,183
we realized that what we preserved

600
00:25:09,223 --> 00:25:10,824
wasn't the final release of the game.

601
00:25:11,485 --> 00:25:12,686
We only preserved the beta.

602
00:25:14,807 --> 00:25:17,489
So effectively, everything they did post-beta was gone.

603
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,812
I wonder what kind of bugs they have in the game now.

604
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:24,474
As you can imagine, that's not good.

605
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:27,070
And so it's a precaution.

606
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:30,611
Use these stories, convince your fellows,

607
00:25:31,151 --> 00:25:32,931
and show them no matter where you are,

608
00:25:33,871 --> 00:25:36,852
how big you are, or even if you already have preserved,

609
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:37,972
there is still danger.

610
00:25:40,673 --> 00:25:42,713
Now that's the theoretical portion of preservation.

611
00:25:42,753 --> 00:25:44,934
Let's talk about the actual cost of preservation.

612
00:25:46,094 --> 00:25:47,454
Are you capable of preserving?

613
00:25:49,555 --> 00:25:52,295
How many heads counts are you gonna have for an archive?

614
00:25:52,957 --> 00:25:55,157
At Electronic Arts, we typically lean between one and three,

615
00:25:55,698 --> 00:25:56,978
depending on the complexity of the title.

616
00:25:58,579 --> 00:26:00,299
Are you prepared to dedicate those numbers?

617
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,741
All right. How many software do you expect them to use?

618
00:26:06,882 --> 00:26:09,743
That list alone covers maybe 15 percent

619
00:26:09,803 --> 00:26:11,764
of the number of software a game typically is built with.

620
00:26:13,865 --> 00:26:15,606
Can you say that those one to three people

621
00:26:15,666 --> 00:26:17,906
are capable of interfacing with every single one of those

622
00:26:17,966 --> 00:26:21,208
to verify your archive is completely capable of being used?

623
00:26:22,488 --> 00:26:24,729
Or at least you have some answers as to how to verify

624
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,330
that those software can be used.

625
00:26:27,531 --> 00:26:28,311
Okay, so let's say you do.

626
00:26:28,351 --> 00:26:29,492
Let's say you have this plan,

627
00:26:29,512 --> 00:26:30,633
you can bring some artists on board,

628
00:26:30,653 --> 00:26:31,913
you can get them to play with the archive.

629
00:26:32,694 --> 00:26:33,654
How long do you think it's gonna take?

630
00:26:34,715 --> 00:26:35,976
How much money do you think it's gonna cost?

631
00:26:37,016 --> 00:26:37,537
It's not cheap.

632
00:26:38,457 --> 00:26:39,158
Can you give me a number?

633
00:26:40,178 --> 00:26:42,019
If you add these three things together

634
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:43,040
and you look into a little bit more,

635
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:46,302
you form a plan, you can create a cost

636
00:26:46,962 --> 00:26:48,223
and tag that to an archive.

637
00:26:49,018 --> 00:26:50,479
That is a number you can give to a lead,

638
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,021
you can give to a producer, an executive,

639
00:26:52,561 --> 00:26:54,702
and they can say, okay, so basically if I want

640
00:26:54,742 --> 00:26:56,123
three archives, it costs this times three.

641
00:26:58,105 --> 00:26:59,606
That is pretty good data to give them.

642
00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:00,907
Again, they are all about data.

643
00:27:02,928 --> 00:27:05,110
So I highly recommend taking some time to analyze

644
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:06,931
how long would it take for you to do an archive.

645
00:27:08,972 --> 00:27:10,693
But archiving is still a technical process.

646
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:12,214
You still have to do the archiving work.

647
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:14,916
So you got to make sure to reduce the manual labor

648
00:27:15,016 --> 00:27:15,897
or it's going to be terrible.

649
00:27:16,497 --> 00:27:17,938
And frankly said, archiving sucks.

650
00:27:19,292 --> 00:27:22,215
Archiving is a slow, egregious process

651
00:27:22,655 --> 00:27:24,676
that's based purely on the tools that were used before.

652
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:27,599
So how can we make this better?

653
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,881
A lot of people will typically say,

654
00:27:29,901 --> 00:27:31,162
let's just throw people at the problem.

655
00:27:31,462 --> 00:27:32,423
We'll increase the head count.

656
00:27:32,463 --> 00:27:33,984
We'll say, let's take our senior engineers

657
00:27:34,024 --> 00:27:35,745
or our senior members and say,

658
00:27:36,145 --> 00:27:37,066
we need you to work on the title.

659
00:27:38,067 --> 00:27:39,708
You guys may have some great archiving experience,

660
00:27:39,728 --> 00:27:40,649
and that's great, that's awesome.

661
00:27:40,669 --> 00:27:42,130
You're probably gonna gain a lot of time from that.

662
00:27:43,071 --> 00:27:46,073
But if your tools are slow, they're not plentiful,

663
00:27:47,147 --> 00:27:48,768
and they'll have perhaps issues in them

664
00:27:48,788 --> 00:27:49,949
that will make this take a long time,

665
00:27:50,649 --> 00:27:51,710
you're not going to gain anything.

666
00:27:52,711 --> 00:27:54,793
It's going to probably be the exact same as it was before.

667
00:27:57,035 --> 00:27:59,437
So that said, let's talk about some tools.

668
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:01,839
Tools that I like to use in my own work,

669
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,940
tools that we use in Electronic Arts,

670
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,662
and tools that I believe anyone can use

671
00:28:05,682 --> 00:28:06,442
to help better their work,

672
00:28:06,462 --> 00:28:07,783
both in archiving and probably anywhere.

673
00:28:09,685 --> 00:28:11,286
Now, the first one I want to talk about,

674
00:28:11,507 --> 00:28:12,547
many of you probably know right now,

675
00:28:13,008 --> 00:28:14,269
who here has heard of virtual machines?

676
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:16,631
Perfect.

677
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:21,106
So let me kind of express the origins of archiving

678
00:28:21,126 --> 00:28:23,007
back in the day before this kind of technology existed.

679
00:28:23,928 --> 00:28:25,249
Let's take a physical PC.

680
00:28:26,731 --> 00:28:28,772
Now let's say we want all the aspects of the game

681
00:28:28,953 --> 00:28:30,114
put onto that PC.

682
00:28:31,815 --> 00:28:33,296
How large do you think that PC's gonna be?

683
00:28:35,478 --> 00:28:37,180
A lot of terabytes.

684
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,161
In fact, it's pretty normal for us

685
00:28:39,181 --> 00:28:40,663
to get 10 plus terabyte machines.

686
00:28:42,294 --> 00:28:43,575
Now let me pose a situation.

687
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:45,316
An audio engineer comes up to you and says,

688
00:28:45,496 --> 00:28:47,337
I want this, I want the audio environment

689
00:28:47,877 --> 00:28:49,318
in that game we preserved.

690
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:52,300
Do you think he'll be happy when you say,

691
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,121
here, have this 10 terabyte machine, have fun?

692
00:28:55,602 --> 00:28:56,402
Probably not very happy.

693
00:28:58,283 --> 00:29:00,084
What can we do to rectify this situation?

694
00:29:01,205 --> 00:29:02,546
That's where we can pull in virtual machines.

695
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,688
Now again, virtual machines start with a physical PC.

696
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,629
What we can do is we can split up the hardware

697
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,091
to create these small virtualized environments.

698
00:29:11,825 --> 00:29:14,167
that all function as complete isolated machines.

699
00:29:14,347 --> 00:29:16,088
They all can have tools installed to them,

700
00:29:16,308 --> 00:29:17,488
they all function in isolation.

701
00:29:18,249 --> 00:29:21,451
Now we can say, each one of you, take an aspect of the game.

702
00:29:22,711 --> 00:29:24,832
Let's take a virtual machine and say,

703
00:29:24,892 --> 00:29:26,493
you are the art, you are the audio machine.

704
00:29:26,553 --> 00:29:28,194
You express all the audio data,

705
00:29:28,755 --> 00:29:30,536
the audio tools, the audio software.

706
00:29:31,296 --> 00:29:33,137
We have another one for art, another one for builds,

707
00:29:33,157 --> 00:29:35,198
another one for server, the list goes on.

708
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,720
You're compartmentalizing everything in your game.

709
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,161
So now let's go back to the situation.

710
00:29:41,548 --> 00:29:42,729
An audio engineer comes up,

711
00:29:43,069 --> 00:29:44,249
he wants to see the audio environment.

712
00:29:45,249 --> 00:29:46,970
How happy do you think he'll be by just saying,

713
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,010
here is literally only the audio?

714
00:29:50,651 --> 00:29:51,471
Probably a lot happier.

715
00:29:53,412 --> 00:29:54,972
And so this is a great tool

716
00:29:54,992 --> 00:29:56,512
that's really provided a lot of value to us.

717
00:29:57,112 --> 00:29:59,493
I recommend everybody here going and exploring a little bit.

718
00:30:00,053 --> 00:30:01,434
The barrier of entry is not too extreme

719
00:30:02,174 --> 00:30:03,134
and can provide a lot of value.

720
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,697
But ultimately speaking, while this helps us set up archives,

721
00:30:08,377 --> 00:30:09,897
we still have trouble when it comes

722
00:30:09,957 --> 00:30:11,978
to getting it set up further.

723
00:30:12,838 --> 00:30:15,519
Again, setting up the audio software, the art software,

724
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:16,979
the tools that production used.

725
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:18,619
How do we make that easier?

726
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:21,420
Well, there's a wonderful tool called Chef.

727
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,100
Who here has heard of Chef before?

728
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,141
A few, a few, a few, less of you,

729
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:29,322
but Chef is a wonderful tool.

730
00:30:29,362 --> 00:30:31,222
But let me again, let me pose a situation so we

731
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:32,162
all can be familiar with it.

732
00:30:33,544 --> 00:30:35,625
Artists are a fun group of people.

733
00:30:36,525 --> 00:30:38,647
Artists have a wonderfully large amount of software

734
00:30:38,707 --> 00:30:40,828
in their tool belt, too many to speak of.

735
00:30:42,189 --> 00:30:43,030
I'm looking at you artists.

736
00:30:46,032 --> 00:30:47,593
The problem with this situation is that

737
00:30:47,693 --> 00:30:49,334
how do you preserve that many things?

738
00:30:50,494 --> 00:30:52,856
For instance, if I say an artist has 20 plus software

739
00:30:52,936 --> 00:30:54,977
and I as a build engineer needs to go and set those up,

740
00:30:55,498 --> 00:30:56,638
how in the world am I supposed to do that?

741
00:30:57,179 --> 00:30:58,400
I have no clue how to operate them.

742
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,521
So if I were to install them,

743
00:31:02,641 --> 00:31:04,062
even if I was following documentation,

744
00:31:04,182 --> 00:31:06,084
I'd probably be led into some human error.

745
00:31:06,624 --> 00:31:08,366
I'd probably set it up wrong, I'd miss a path,

746
00:31:08,426 --> 00:31:09,106
I'd probably mess it up.

747
00:31:09,627 --> 00:31:12,009
I wouldn't know how to resolve any issues with it.

748
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:16,692
And so it becomes an inefficient and ineffective process.

749
00:31:17,933 --> 00:31:19,475
So what we've done is we've looked at Chef by saying,

750
00:31:20,275 --> 00:31:22,617
okay, so typically speaking, I'm a build engineer,

751
00:31:23,238 --> 00:31:25,619
what can I do to use my skillset

752
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,961
to better the process of archiving?

753
00:31:29,222 --> 00:31:29,743
Can I code it?

754
00:31:30,673 --> 00:31:32,274
The typical engineer response, can I just code it?

755
00:31:32,734 --> 00:31:33,514
Can I just do it in code?

756
00:31:34,295 --> 00:31:34,875
Yes, you can.

757
00:31:35,976 --> 00:31:37,576
In the world of Chef, Chef allows you

758
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:38,677
to create what's called cookbooks.

759
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,838
Yes, I know, the naming convention is wonderful.

760
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:42,479
You create these cookbooks,

761
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,340
and each cookbook has a list of recipes.

762
00:31:45,601 --> 00:31:47,382
The recipes all define a software,

763
00:31:47,522 --> 00:31:48,642
and let's say the software version,

764
00:31:49,303 --> 00:31:50,283
and a set of instructions.

765
00:31:50,303 --> 00:31:53,465
You can see where I'm about to go with this.

766
00:31:54,165 --> 00:31:55,846
The set of instructions define in code

767
00:31:56,006 --> 00:31:57,847
exactly how to configure, install it,

768
00:31:58,067 --> 00:31:59,068
and place it onto the machine.

769
00:32:00,187 --> 00:32:01,268
You work with an artist, you say,

770
00:32:01,568 --> 00:32:02,909
tell me how I need to install this.

771
00:32:02,989 --> 00:32:06,112
I will write it in this recipe. It will be done through code.

772
00:32:07,453 --> 00:32:09,835
I've effectively just codified my entire game.

773
00:32:10,455 --> 00:32:12,517
And the practice is called configuration as code.

774
00:32:14,038 --> 00:32:15,659
The beauty of this, and while this is great

775
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,120
if you're working on a single title,

776
00:32:17,841 --> 00:32:19,102
the more your company grows,

777
00:32:19,142 --> 00:32:20,663
the more titles you have going on at once,

778
00:32:21,264 --> 00:32:23,385
the more you need to see that your technology grows with you.

779
00:32:24,866 --> 00:32:27,088
Because this process is codified,

780
00:32:27,108 --> 00:32:29,250
and it's frankly just a bunch of text files,

781
00:32:30,085 --> 00:32:32,186
I can literally just copy it and within 10 seconds,

782
00:32:34,267 --> 00:32:37,649
make another one with a whole other set of software listed

783
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:38,549
in all different versions.

784
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:40,350
That's wonderful.

785
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:42,591
And with a company like Electronic Arts,

786
00:32:42,751 --> 00:32:44,392
we have so many games going on at once,

787
00:32:44,892 --> 00:32:46,493
this is an invaluable process to us.

788
00:32:47,613 --> 00:32:48,794
And so I highly recommend it once again.

789
00:32:49,194 --> 00:32:50,174
You can access it right now.

790
00:32:50,575 --> 00:32:52,215
The barrier of entry is a little bit steep,

791
00:32:52,255 --> 00:32:52,996
but I do recommend it.

792
00:32:53,756 --> 00:32:55,016
They have a wonderful set of documentation.

793
00:32:57,242 --> 00:32:58,923
And while ultimately this provides a lot of value

794
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:00,685
for us today, what does tomorrow look like?

795
00:33:03,007 --> 00:33:03,947
What does the future look like?

796
00:33:04,948 --> 00:33:05,729
Now are we prepared for it?

797
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:08,812
The future is going to be weird.

798
00:33:09,252 --> 00:33:10,073
It's going to be intense

799
00:33:10,813 --> 00:33:12,835
and extraordinarily quick in development.

800
00:33:14,036 --> 00:33:15,357
Electronic Arts, we know this.

801
00:33:15,658 --> 00:33:16,638
And in fact, we talk about this.

802
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,023
In a 24-page report from our CTO, Ken Moss,

803
00:33:22,841 --> 00:33:24,281
He talked about what's called the Project Atlas.

804
00:33:25,001 --> 00:33:26,742
You can all access it. It's publicly available.

805
00:33:27,442 --> 00:33:29,302
And talks about EA's giant push to the cloud.

806
00:33:31,062 --> 00:33:32,363
So far, we've defined a process

807
00:33:32,403 --> 00:33:35,583
as about defining building games without cloud services.

808
00:33:36,203 --> 00:33:38,504
What does preservation look like with cloud services?

809
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:40,104
Are we ready for that?

810
00:33:42,524 --> 00:33:43,844
In an interview with Bloomberg,

811
00:33:44,085 --> 00:33:46,105
our CEO, Andrew Wilson, talked about,

812
00:33:46,845 --> 00:33:48,525
right now while we're doing yearly release models

813
00:33:48,545 --> 00:33:49,245
in some of our games,

814
00:33:49,765 --> 00:33:52,286
what happens if we bring that down to monthly, weekly?

815
00:33:52,877 --> 00:33:56,638
daily, it is already challenging to get games done in a year,

816
00:33:57,218 --> 00:33:58,738
in terms of archiving. How can we do that

817
00:33:58,858 --> 00:34:00,199
when it is so much faster?

818
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:04,780
These two things are terrifying concepts

819
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,720
when it comes to preservation.

820
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,421
But no matter how scary the future looks,

821
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:11,241
we have to look back at the basics.

822
00:34:11,461 --> 00:34:12,841
Why are we archiving in the first place?

823
00:34:14,722 --> 00:34:16,122
We are archiving because we have history.

824
00:34:17,145 --> 00:34:19,006
We have history, we have games we love,

825
00:34:19,186 --> 00:34:20,487
both as users and as developers.

826
00:34:21,128 --> 00:34:22,429
We have thousands of hours sunk

827
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:24,210
into making sure our players are happy.

828
00:34:26,372 --> 00:34:28,734
If we don't preserve, if we don't preserve

829
00:34:28,754 --> 00:34:31,016
making sure our games are recorded in history,

830
00:34:31,976 --> 00:34:34,198
everything you ever loved in games will disappear.

831
00:34:38,902 --> 00:34:40,003
Now with that morbid thought out of the way,

832
00:34:41,464 --> 00:34:41,964
let's wrap up.

833
00:34:44,486 --> 00:34:45,827
Don't be known as an industry tragedy.

834
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,151
I've told you stories about what happens

835
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:49,771
if you don't preserve.

836
00:34:50,711 --> 00:34:52,973
I've hopefully hit it home that that's not a good thing.

837
00:34:54,354 --> 00:34:56,295
I do not want to put you on this list next year.

838
00:35:00,357 --> 00:35:02,098
Automate and build, reduced manual labor.

839
00:35:02,578 --> 00:35:03,699
Right now archiving is awful.

840
00:35:04,399 --> 00:35:05,940
It's a slow process, our tools suck.

841
00:35:06,461 --> 00:35:07,201
How can we make it better?

842
00:35:09,302 --> 00:35:09,803
It's up to you.

843
00:35:10,603 --> 00:35:11,043
Look into it.

844
00:35:11,264 --> 00:35:12,204
Let's have a conversation.

845
00:35:12,925 --> 00:35:14,305
There's always a way we can make it better.

846
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:16,046
But again.

847
00:35:17,189 --> 00:35:18,170
you have to be prepared.

848
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,351
Archiving might be stressful today.

849
00:35:20,371 --> 00:35:22,092
It's going to get a lot weirder

850
00:35:22,212 --> 00:35:23,213
and a lot harder in the future.

851
00:35:23,233 --> 00:35:25,954
So with that said,

852
00:35:27,015 --> 00:35:27,555
thank you for coming.

853
00:35:34,959 --> 00:35:36,480
All right, I believe we have time for some questions.

854
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,961
We actually probably have a lot of time for questions,

855
00:35:38,001 --> 00:35:40,082
so feel free to stand up to the stand

856
00:35:40,102 --> 00:35:41,663
and ask me what you like.

857
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:48,105
Hi, so how does this process differ if you're like a one-person team?

858
00:35:49,006 --> 00:35:53,089
All right. So one-person team is a great question. So let me rephrase.

859
00:35:53,189 --> 00:35:56,232
The question that you were asking is how does this process apply to a one-person

860
00:35:56,252 --> 00:35:57,753
team? Now,

861
00:35:58,493 --> 00:36:01,756
when you talked about the historical preservation of things,

862
00:36:02,697 --> 00:36:04,318
do you want to see your games again in 10 years?

863
00:36:05,439 --> 00:36:06,140
Most likely, yes.

864
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:09,823
Then you should be doing it. If you want to see your work in 10 years,

865
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:10,783
you should be preserving.

866
00:36:11,941 --> 00:36:14,062
Not, you don't always have the understanding

867
00:36:14,102 --> 00:36:16,204
of whether you want to remaster, and that's not relevant.

868
00:36:16,364 --> 00:36:17,765
What's relevant is that do you

869
00:36:18,725 --> 00:36:19,686
want to see your games again?

870
00:36:20,546 --> 00:36:21,827
If that's your, if your answer is yes,

871
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:23,588
then you should probably be doing preservation.

872
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:25,789
If you're, in terms of process though,

873
00:36:25,929 --> 00:36:28,511
if you, when you're doing a one-person team,

874
00:36:28,751 --> 00:36:30,692
tier two and tier three is pretty hard to achieve.

875
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,994
If you can, get virtual machines up and running.

876
00:36:34,875 --> 00:36:36,836
However, a tier one I think is a great start.

877
00:36:37,676 --> 00:36:39,077
I'd say tier one, and then if you can,

878
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:39,818
grow to a tier two.

879
00:36:41,277 --> 00:36:42,118
Did I answer your question?

880
00:36:42,818 --> 00:36:43,358
Yeah, thank you.

881
00:36:43,759 --> 00:36:44,019
Thank you.

882
00:36:47,181 --> 00:36:49,162
I think it's kind of related to that one.

883
00:36:49,222 --> 00:36:52,243
So, small team, right?

884
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:58,467
Probably zero days off between projects.

885
00:36:59,267 --> 00:36:59,648
That's fair.

886
00:36:59,668 --> 00:37:01,869
You know, what sort of tier zero, right?

887
00:37:01,909 --> 00:37:04,650
Like what is the like, okay, you can't even get to tier one.

888
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:06,992
What's the like worst case scenario,

889
00:37:07,052 --> 00:37:10,013
just get something in their process for you guys?

890
00:37:10,815 --> 00:37:13,176
So the question was, small team again,

891
00:37:14,136 --> 00:37:17,117
what would the baseline be?

892
00:37:17,438 --> 00:37:18,078
Is that kind of a good?

893
00:37:18,398 --> 00:37:19,178
Sure, that's a good way, yeah.

894
00:37:19,618 --> 00:37:21,219
So what would the baseline of preservation be?

895
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:22,540
Where could I start if nothing else?

896
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,801
A tier, I would say a backup is a tier one.

897
00:37:25,461 --> 00:37:26,541
If you use version control,

898
00:37:26,781 --> 00:37:29,042
or if you simply have your files stored on Google Drive

899
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:31,443
or anything like that, right click, hit download,

900
00:37:31,643 --> 00:37:32,324
put it into a folder.

901
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:35,525
Everything you've ever built, put it into a folder,

902
00:37:35,665 --> 00:37:37,226
that is, I would consider a tier one.

903
00:37:37,832 --> 00:37:41,134
Yeah, and then like a weird archivist 50 years from now

904
00:37:41,174 --> 00:37:42,135
might piece it together.

905
00:37:42,255 --> 00:37:42,575
Exactly.

906
00:37:42,595 --> 00:37:43,176
Yeah, totally.

907
00:37:43,456 --> 00:37:46,378
Yeah, so again, tier one and tier zero and tier one

908
00:37:46,418 --> 00:37:48,240
is really the difference between the auxiliary aspects

909
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,001
like documentation.

910
00:37:49,841 --> 00:37:51,823
If you wanna just get a record of your stuff,

911
00:37:52,283 --> 00:37:53,204
yeah, just hit download.

912
00:37:53,284 --> 00:37:54,145
That's all you need to do.

913
00:37:54,165 --> 00:37:54,945
That's a good entry point.

914
00:37:55,185 --> 00:37:55,606
Cool, thanks.

915
00:37:56,086 --> 00:37:56,326
Thank you.

916
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:00,169
Hey, thanks for the great talk.

917
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:03,732
I was wondering during the process of internally

918
00:38:03,772 --> 00:38:05,914
in the company introducing this archiving,

919
00:38:07,917 --> 00:38:10,639
Did you have to at any point, for example, involve InfoSec?

920
00:38:10,759 --> 00:38:13,701
Did you come across with bad practices, you know,

921
00:38:13,762 --> 00:38:15,983
something that you had to globally change,

922
00:38:16,023 --> 00:38:19,426
for example, during EA, like, I'm thinking practical example,

923
00:38:19,446 --> 00:38:23,910
like one content team just using pirated software,

924
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:24,931
or, you know, something that, you know,

925
00:38:24,971 --> 00:38:26,472
was just completely incompatible,

926
00:38:26,592 --> 00:38:28,874
but you kind of like accidentally found it

927
00:38:28,914 --> 00:38:30,115
because you had to review the whole,

928
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:32,577
I guess during the archiving,

929
00:38:32,617 --> 00:38:36,100
you get to see all the practices the company does currently.

930
00:38:36,922 --> 00:38:38,742
So before I rephrase the question, I just want to clarify.

931
00:38:39,162 --> 00:38:42,102
Do you mean in these practices of preservation

932
00:38:42,142 --> 00:38:43,343
or the practices of the developer?

933
00:38:43,943 --> 00:38:46,143
Practice of how the company develops software

934
00:38:46,243 --> 00:38:47,303
and what tools use.

935
00:38:47,703 --> 00:38:49,984
So the question was, during my work in electronic arts

936
00:38:50,024 --> 00:38:51,104
and during the work of preservation,

937
00:38:51,124 --> 00:38:53,584
do you typically come across or do you come across

938
00:38:53,824 --> 00:38:55,365
bad practices, is that a fair?

939
00:38:55,925 --> 00:38:58,565
Yes, do you have any kind of experience or gotchas?

940
00:38:59,685 --> 00:39:02,066
Even though you wouldn't start archiving process now,

941
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:05,226
maybe you should still within your company check,

942
00:39:05,366 --> 00:39:06,147
are you also doing this?

943
00:39:06,949 --> 00:39:07,229
Perfect.

944
00:39:07,809 --> 00:39:10,932
So yes, I have definitely come across bad practices.

945
00:39:11,293 --> 00:39:12,273
It is evident everywhere.

946
00:39:12,734 --> 00:39:13,915
Not every developer is perfect.

947
00:39:14,536 --> 00:39:16,938
Not every developer lines up with preservation.

948
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:20,902
A common one is that where they store files.

949
00:39:22,303 --> 00:39:24,565
It is a common thing for developers to store files

950
00:39:24,605 --> 00:39:26,567
in places that is not known to who's archiving it.

951
00:39:27,788 --> 00:39:30,510
And what is a very dangerous terminology we use

952
00:39:30,591 --> 00:39:31,591
is tribal knowledge.

953
00:39:32,842 --> 00:39:35,845
It's a tribal knowledge is when a team has knowledge strictly

954
00:39:35,865 --> 00:39:36,785
with amongst themselves.

955
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:37,866
They have not shared it.

956
00:39:38,226 --> 00:39:39,487
It does not exist outside of that.

957
00:39:40,408 --> 00:39:42,049
That is a massive danger to preservation

958
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:44,771
because if the person preserving it doesn't know it exists,

959
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:46,413
it won't be preserved.

960
00:39:47,293 --> 00:39:49,015
And so yes, there are a lot of bad practices,

961
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:52,938
tools that require, let's say, non-perpetual licenses

962
00:39:53,698 --> 00:39:55,740
are a great deal of a threat to preservation.

963
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,403
And there are perhaps external vendors.

964
00:40:00,614 --> 00:40:02,555
None of that can be archived, so that is a red flag.

965
00:40:03,316 --> 00:40:04,437
And so yes, to answer your question,

966
00:40:04,457 --> 00:40:07,059
there are a lot of cases where that practice has come up.

967
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:07,679
Yeah, I think it does, yeah.

968
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:07,939
Thank you.

969
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:08,499
Thank you.

970
00:40:10,821 --> 00:40:13,743
So I think that you just kind of touched on it at the end,

971
00:40:13,983 --> 00:40:17,165
but knowing that software, be it Maya or anything else,

972
00:40:17,205 --> 00:40:18,426
has licensing servers,

973
00:40:18,466 --> 00:40:21,548
and now console development hardware has licensing,

974
00:40:22,009 --> 00:40:24,330
where after 180 days, you get locked out.

975
00:40:24,893 --> 00:40:31,237
what is EA doing to try to ensure that you have some sort of access outside of that area?

976
00:40:31,277 --> 00:40:38,382
All right, so the question was with licenses being perhaps not perpetual and they do expire

977
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:42,364
after a time or software stop working after a period of time, what is Electronic Arts doing

978
00:40:42,384 --> 00:40:46,407
to combat that? What are they doing to making sure that they can still operate with that in mind?

979
00:40:46,427 --> 00:40:51,751
Is that a good recollection? Okay, so the question and the answer is that a lot of

980
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:54,184
It's a weird situation.

981
00:40:54,204 --> 00:40:55,585
A lot of companies are working with us

982
00:40:55,685 --> 00:40:57,146
to make sure that what are your needs,

983
00:40:57,166 --> 00:40:57,927
what can we do for you,

984
00:40:57,967 --> 00:41:00,088
and a lot of companies do opt for perpetual licenses,

985
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:02,150
or they'll kind of work with us to get one.

986
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:03,270
That's great.

987
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:04,871
There are cases where inevitably

988
00:41:04,932 --> 00:41:06,673
we cannot provide a license.

989
00:41:07,593 --> 00:41:09,615
For instance, audio software are known for that.

990
00:41:10,175 --> 00:41:11,936
It's expensive licenses and it's troubling

991
00:41:11,976 --> 00:41:13,818
to just put that into an archive.

992
00:41:14,778 --> 00:41:17,140
And so there are situations where we cannot say

993
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,921
that this will 100% function.

994
00:41:20,042 --> 00:41:21,883
And so, yes, there is an inevitable end of.

995
00:41:23,475 --> 00:41:24,195
We are trying our best.

996
00:41:24,235 --> 00:41:26,156
We are constantly in communications with other companies

997
00:41:26,176 --> 00:41:26,956
to try to get it to work.

998
00:41:27,656 --> 00:41:30,097
But there is that kind of end that we have to expect.

999
00:41:30,797 --> 00:41:31,077
Thank you.

1000
00:41:31,337 --> 00:41:31,618
Thank you.

1001
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:37,460
I wanna ask about, do you have a preferred storage medium?

1002
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,061
Tape, Blu-ray, Glacier, and then how do you keep track

1003
00:41:41,101 --> 00:41:43,041
of what's in this giant storage medium

1004
00:41:43,081 --> 00:41:44,002
of all the archive data?

1005
00:41:44,562 --> 00:41:45,522
All right, so the question was,

1006
00:41:46,743 --> 00:41:48,163
what is our preferred storage medium?

1007
00:41:48,723 --> 00:41:51,704
AWS, Glacier, I don't know, hard drive.

1008
00:41:52,025 --> 00:41:52,285
Yeah, yeah.

1009
00:41:53,488 --> 00:41:55,749
And I believe that you had a follow-up point to that as well?

1010
00:41:56,009 --> 00:41:57,710
Yeah, it was like, so you mentioned the catalog,

1011
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:58,950
which is kind of like a webpage list

1012
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:01,331
of what's in each individual title archive, I guess.

1013
00:42:01,912 --> 00:42:05,153
But how do you, like if you have a bunch of Glacier buckets

1014
00:42:05,233 --> 00:42:06,514
or a bunch of hard drives on a shelf,

1015
00:42:06,974 --> 00:42:07,754
do you have a different way,

1016
00:42:07,815 --> 00:42:09,375
or is it you just do it in the catalog

1017
00:42:09,555 --> 00:42:11,716
of keeping track of which hard drive has this title,

1018
00:42:11,756 --> 00:42:12,257
that kind of thing?

1019
00:42:13,057 --> 00:42:13,697
That's a great question.

1020
00:42:13,717 --> 00:42:15,198
So the follow-up point of that is,

1021
00:42:15,598 --> 00:42:18,359
how are we keeping track of the data scale of this stuff?

1022
00:42:18,379 --> 00:42:19,920
And so that's a great question.

1023
00:42:20,699 --> 00:42:22,520
Thankfully enough, technology has provided answers

1024
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,220
in terms of tools.

1025
00:42:24,201 --> 00:42:27,182
We can run massive queries based on this storage.

1026
00:42:27,923 --> 00:42:30,945
I'm not too keen or privy to the information

1027
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,006
regarding what service we use for the storage.

1028
00:42:34,146 --> 00:42:36,648
I wanna say Glacier, but I can't confirm,

1029
00:42:36,688 --> 00:42:38,129
only because I don't know personally.

1030
00:42:39,037 --> 00:42:42,998
Regarding tracking scale, there are a lot of command line options you can do.

1031
00:42:43,058 --> 00:42:48,099
You run a couple day long batch, yes, a couple day long batch, and it will just track and

1032
00:42:48,139 --> 00:42:49,880
scan everything, and we can record that.

1033
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:55,221
When we're doing archiving, as archivers when we do our work, we are constantly querying

1034
00:42:55,361 --> 00:42:55,701
everything.

1035
00:42:56,121 --> 00:42:59,923
For instance, Perforce as a version control system has a built-in answer for that, and

1036
00:42:59,963 --> 00:43:00,943
so we probably know that.

1037
00:43:01,283 --> 00:43:03,744
When it gets put away, we most likely do a tool-based scan.

1038
00:43:03,764 --> 00:43:04,964
Thank you.

1039
00:43:04,984 --> 00:43:05,064
Cool.

1040
00:43:05,084 --> 00:43:05,284
Thank you.

1041
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:09,791
Hi.

1042
00:43:10,031 --> 00:43:12,975
Is there much carryover between the work that EA does privately

1043
00:43:13,256 --> 00:43:15,459
with public organizations, companies that are looking,

1044
00:43:15,479 --> 00:43:17,201
or groups or companies that are looking

1045
00:43:17,241 --> 00:43:20,165
to sort of preserve the history overall of games as a medium?

1046
00:43:20,185 --> 00:43:23,350
Is there information that you share, anything like that?

1047
00:43:24,131 --> 00:43:24,772
So the question was?

1048
00:43:25,764 --> 00:43:29,286
Do we work alongside other companies who are in this space of preservation,

1049
00:43:29,326 --> 00:43:31,488
and do we work on their processes or share our information?

1050
00:43:31,628 --> 00:43:32,449
Is that kind of a fair...?

1051
00:43:32,469 --> 00:43:32,549
Yeah.

1052
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:35,551
So we definitely have a great interest in this space.

1053
00:43:36,452 --> 00:43:39,314
For example, I'm here trying to meet other people who are doing preservation.

1054
00:43:39,655 --> 00:43:42,177
We are going to conferences around the world trying to engage with partners.

1055
00:43:42,637 --> 00:43:47,101
There are preservation meetings strictly amongst preservation engineers to discuss this very topic.

1056
00:43:47,621 --> 00:43:50,143
And so we are definitely going out and we are learning about other developers

1057
00:43:50,163 --> 00:43:51,244
and learning about how they preserve.

1058
00:43:52,139 --> 00:43:54,802
We have had conversations with historical museums.

1059
00:43:54,862 --> 00:43:56,664
In fact, some of our people have actually had pictures

1060
00:43:56,704 --> 00:43:58,706
with these famous articles of old games.

1061
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:02,490
We definitely have an interest in going out of our way.

1062
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:04,271
In fact, I'm here for that very reason.

1063
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:05,833
Does that answer your question?

1064
00:44:05,993 --> 00:44:06,514
Yes, thank you.

1065
00:44:06,754 --> 00:44:07,014
Thank you.

1066
00:44:08,496 --> 00:44:09,396
Any last questions?

1067
00:44:09,477 --> 00:44:10,878
Anyone want to roast me a little bit?

1068
00:44:13,921 --> 00:44:14,802
All right, I think that is it.

1069
00:44:15,022 --> 00:44:16,303
Thank you very much, everyone, for coming.
