1
00:00:06,316 --> 00:00:07,897
I work at a place called Mount Sinai.

2
00:00:07,937 --> 00:00:08,538
It's a hospital.

3
00:00:09,038 --> 00:00:11,560
For those of you who haven't come across it before,

4
00:00:12,501 --> 00:00:14,803
it's a hospital system in New York City.

5
00:00:15,343 --> 00:00:18,526
There are eight hospitals, several hundred clinics,

6
00:00:19,026 --> 00:00:21,749
tens of thousands of clinicians, and millions of patients

7
00:00:22,909 --> 00:00:24,831
that go through Mount Sinai every single year.

8
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:29,775
And my role at Mount Sinai is to run a place

9
00:00:29,795 --> 00:00:31,677
that we call the Abilities Research Center.

10
00:00:33,581 --> 00:00:36,863
And we really built the Abilities Research Center

11
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:41,666
because of a couple of horrifying statistics,

12
00:00:41,747 --> 00:00:44,108
and I'm gonna run those by you in rapid fire

13
00:00:44,648 --> 00:00:46,250
just to give you a sense of where we come from.

14
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:47,931
The first one.

15
00:00:48,812 --> 00:00:54,738
It came out in Forbes magazine in 2016 and it was about health technology companies.

16
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,701
They said that 98% of digital health start-ups are zombies.

17
00:00:57,741 --> 00:01:05,450
What they meant by zombies was that 98% of digital health start-ups were failing before

18
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:07,392
they got to touch a human being.

19
00:01:09,914 --> 00:01:13,917
You know, on average, these companies were raising a few million dollars a piece,

20
00:01:14,837 --> 00:01:19,580
and then 98% of them would die before they actually got to help someone.

21
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:22,042
When you think about the fact that...

22
00:01:23,162 --> 00:01:28,748
The health technology industry right now is around $85 billion a year, and I think

23
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:31,631
the NIH budget is around $35 billion a year.

24
00:01:32,331 --> 00:01:37,497
That's a tremendous waste of money on technology that could actually be helping people.

25
00:01:38,178 --> 00:01:40,740
So that was the first thing that really got our attention.

26
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:48,284
The second thing that got our attention was that in the pharmaceutical industry we've heard of this concept of the valley of death.

27
00:01:48,805 --> 00:01:55,628
This idea that to take an idea in healthcare from the moment that you conceive of it,

28
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:59,730
the moment that you're like, I've got something and I want to develop it further.

29
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,973
all the way over to the point where it's actually in common clinical usage,

30
00:02:05,235 --> 00:02:09,059
that period of time is 17 years in the United States.

31
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,025
And this is not, we're not talking about medicine here.

32
00:02:14,065 --> 00:02:17,028
We're talking about an app. We're talking about, you know,

33
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:21,711
We're talking about very, very common technology,

34
00:02:22,652 --> 00:02:24,593
and it takes this long to cross the valley of death.

35
00:02:26,054 --> 00:02:28,095
Obviously there are a lot of issues with this.

36
00:02:29,576 --> 00:02:32,517
First and foremost, who is still using the same phone

37
00:02:32,537 --> 00:02:34,038
that they were using 17 years ago?

38
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,780
In fact, who had a phone 17 years ago?

39
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,521
Let's start there.

40
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,963
This is the problem with integrating technology into healthcare.

41
00:02:42,023 --> 00:02:48,149
So, the mission of our lab and our space is to take technologies and rush them through

42
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:53,675
clinical trial protocols, get them in front of the FDA, have the right conversations,

43
00:02:53,735 --> 00:02:59,481
and get them into the hands of clinicians as quickly as is humanly possible and is responsible to do so.

44
00:03:00,922 --> 00:03:02,642
And ever since we started the lab,

45
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,842
we've had a lot of clinical trials starting up,

46
00:03:04,942 --> 00:03:06,163
coming out of the lab,

47
00:03:06,223 --> 00:03:08,643
and they range from everything from

48
00:03:08,823 --> 00:03:11,664
the simplest of mobile app technologies.

49
00:03:12,504 --> 00:03:13,764
Just gonna give you a quick example.

50
00:03:14,784 --> 00:03:17,045
This is a technology that has been,

51
00:03:17,345 --> 00:03:19,185
the name has been changed, it's now called WellPath,

52
00:03:19,245 --> 00:03:21,626
but it is a app for suicide prevention,

53
00:03:22,886 --> 00:03:25,266
where what we have shown is that

54
00:03:25,346 --> 00:03:28,467
when people who are at risk of suicide use this app,

55
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:33,850
They can experience a 35% reduction in negative emotions

56
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,151
that bring on suicidal thoughts

57
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:37,353
within two minutes of interacting with the app.

58
00:03:37,373 --> 00:03:39,975
So we're talking about point of care emotion regulation.

59
00:03:40,395 --> 00:03:43,757
So we're rushing this through clinical trials as we speak

60
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,100
and working with, pardon me?

61
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,543
It's called WellPath, yep.

62
00:03:51,803 --> 00:03:54,685
And it follows the PATH technique,

63
00:03:54,785 --> 00:03:56,206
problem adaptation therapy by,

64
00:03:58,478 --> 00:04:00,559
a psychologist called Dimitris Chiosas.

65
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:07,142
So this would be an indication of a low-tech technology that we're working with.

66
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:11,864
Right on the other end of the spectrum, this is a technology called a stentrode.

67
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,938
This is developed by a neurosurgeon at Mount Sinai.

68
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:19,861
And what we're looking at right now is an endovascular stent,

69
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:22,984
something that ordinarily goes into your blood vessels and holds them open,

70
00:04:23,244 --> 00:04:25,425
but it has electrodes built into it.

71
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:29,548
So this technology will go into the superior sagittal sinus,

72
00:04:29,568 --> 00:04:31,890
which is the blood vessel you're seeing it go into now.

73
00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:35,273
And as it is withdrawn,

74
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:38,812
It will heal into the blood vessel.

75
00:04:38,852 --> 00:04:40,816
So you're about to see what happens

76
00:04:40,877 --> 00:04:42,340
over a period of a few days.

77
00:04:44,304 --> 00:04:47,786
Once it's healed into the blood vessel, it can actually record brain activity.

78
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:54,371
Very, very similar to something like EEG, but internally, so there's no sort of sensors

79
00:04:54,411 --> 00:04:57,933
getting knocked off or external noise affecting the recordings.

80
00:04:58,594 --> 00:05:05,439
Once you're recording EEG, we can implant it into someone with, say, ALS, who can only

81
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:06,800
communicate with eye movements.

82
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:11,445
And rather than having them communicate at a rate of two words per minute,

83
00:05:11,665 --> 00:05:14,888
because they need to look at the letter that they want,

84
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:19,073
hover over that letter, and then wait for the hover to initiate a click.

85
00:05:19,772 --> 00:05:24,993
They can look at the letter that they want, think, click, and the system will click for them,

86
00:05:26,153 --> 00:05:32,695
accelerating their communication rate to about 10 words per minute. So that's the goal of a project

87
00:05:32,735 --> 00:05:37,356
that we'll be starting at the end of this year in our first in-human trials with this technology.

88
00:05:37,396 --> 00:05:41,757
So that's kind of the scope of the projects that we work on, all the way from, you know,

89
00:05:42,277 --> 00:05:47,861
Mobile apps all the way out to implantables, injectables, and really fun technology.

90
00:05:48,141 --> 00:05:53,485
I really think we got a cool job because we just get to play all day long with fun tech.

91
00:05:54,686 --> 00:05:54,826
But...

92
00:05:55,777 --> 00:05:56,857
Today's talk is about pain.

93
00:05:57,318 --> 00:06:01,700
So one of the projects that I'm really proud of and excited

94
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,101
about is some of the work that we're doing with pain.

95
00:06:04,502 --> 00:06:07,223
Unless you've not been paying too much attention

96
00:06:07,303 --> 00:06:09,645
to the global conversation recently,

97
00:06:09,725 --> 00:06:11,746
pain is a big problem, especially

98
00:06:11,806 --> 00:06:14,408
in Western countries, especially as it

99
00:06:14,448 --> 00:06:17,429
pertains to the opioid crisis and the way

100
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:20,591
that we manage pain currently, especially chronic pain.

101
00:06:21,452 --> 00:06:27,094
And I wanted to take a real big step back, because typically when I'm talking about the

102
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:32,496
role of virtual reality and pain, you know, I sort of have to sort of run through it.

103
00:06:32,536 --> 00:06:37,298
But I figured today we could take a little bit more time just to talk about how virtual

104
00:06:37,338 --> 00:06:44,001
reality might help someone's pain. And we can start with the Neuroanatomy 101.

105
00:06:44,981 --> 00:06:47,843
So, we have areas of the brain that are focused on

106
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,642
producing movement and sensing things that are coming in from the outside world.

107
00:06:53,443 --> 00:06:58,506
And what we've known about the brain for a little while is that the sensory and motor areas of the

108
00:06:58,546 --> 00:07:05,931
brain are actually really well organized. You can get quite a nice map of the body from the amount

109
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:12,316
of brain tissue that is assigned to each body part. And what we tend to notice is if you happen

110
00:07:12,356 --> 00:07:17,839
to use a certain body part more, more brain tissue will be assigned to that particular body part.

111
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:26,864
And so in most people, what you end up with is a funny little guy like this, which is

112
00:07:26,984 --> 00:07:35,589
your motor homunculus, where what you see is how many bits of brain tissue is assigned

113
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:40,552
to each body part, and they're represented by being larger in the picture if you have

114
00:07:40,592 --> 00:07:42,173
more brain tissue assigned to it.

115
00:07:44,258 --> 00:07:47,339
Up until around the 70s or 80s, maybe even the 90s

116
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:49,080
in some of the slower moving hospitals,

117
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,241
this map was thought to be static.

118
00:07:52,561 --> 00:07:54,301
It never changed throughout your life.

119
00:07:54,461 --> 00:07:56,402
This is you for the rest of your life.

120
00:07:57,482 --> 00:07:59,883
But what we started to see was actually it did change.

121
00:08:00,183 --> 00:08:02,344
So it had the potential to get better,

122
00:08:02,364 --> 00:08:03,724
it had the potential to get worse,

123
00:08:03,924 --> 00:08:06,445
it had the potential to always be dynamically changing

124
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:09,205
depending on what sort of trauma you were exposed to

125
00:08:09,886 --> 00:08:12,746
or what sort of skills you were learning and practicing.

126
00:08:14,247 --> 00:08:19,430
So, when we think about this in the context of pain, what starts to happen is, let's say,

127
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,272
for instance, you have an injury to your hand.

128
00:08:23,053 --> 00:08:26,295
And you have chronic hand pain as a result of that injury.

129
00:08:27,276 --> 00:08:32,779
What starts to happen with your motor and sensory representations is not only do they

130
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:33,420
start to...

131
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:41,222
react to the hand pain in a way that you start avoiding movements, you start using the hand

132
00:08:41,282 --> 00:08:45,624
less, you start to learn to use the other hand, for instance, because you know that

133
00:08:45,724 --> 00:08:46,704
using this hand will hurt.

134
00:08:47,424 --> 00:08:50,405
But as well as that, you also start to fear using the hand.

135
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:57,928
So a really great researcher by the name of David Butler actually showed that, and his

136
00:08:57,968 --> 00:08:59,468
colleague Laura Mimosly showed that.

137
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:06,474
When they put a whole bunch of chronic pain patients into an MRI scanner and asked them

138
00:09:06,514 --> 00:09:11,215
to imagine using the painful hand, and then they had a whole bunch of blinded radiologists

139
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:16,637
reading the brain scan and trying to diagnose the patient, all of the radiologists said,

140
00:09:16,737 --> 00:09:21,458
oh, you brought me phobia patients, because what they were seeing were the fear centers

141
00:09:21,498 --> 00:09:21,898
lighting up.

142
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:30,603
Not only do they start to see fear, but they start to see loss of that hand representation.

143
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:33,304
They actually described it in their research as blurring.

144
00:09:33,524 --> 00:09:37,166
The hand representation starts to get very sort of confused.

145
00:09:38,747 --> 00:09:44,210
Neurons from other representations, like your leg or your arm, start to take over your hand

146
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:44,970
representation.

147
00:09:46,311 --> 00:09:50,315
What that results in is this weird dysmorphia where you don't really know where your hand

148
00:09:50,415 --> 00:09:50,515
is.

149
00:09:50,955 --> 00:09:55,339
What we know about chronic pain patients now is if they have chronic hand pain, even the

150
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:59,983
task of looking at a magazine and telling you if they're looking at a left or a right

151
00:10:00,043 --> 00:10:04,627
hand is harder than it is for an average individual without hand pain.

152
00:10:05,007 --> 00:10:09,651
So their whole relationship with their painful limb gets thrown out of whack.

153
00:10:10,772 --> 00:10:11,053
And so

154
00:10:12,472 --> 00:10:16,915
Once we started to think about what we could do to fix this problem, a whole bunch of clever

155
00:10:16,955 --> 00:10:24,619
people started to realize that the nervous system can be tricked in lots of ways to rebuild

156
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,940
a relationship with the hand.

157
00:10:28,182 --> 00:10:33,465
We have this whole network of neurons that are affectionately called mirror neurons.

158
00:10:34,225 --> 00:10:38,087
Some people like that name, some people hate that name, but effectively what these mirror

159
00:10:38,107 --> 00:10:43,749
neurons are, are a network of neurons that will fire and get excited.

160
00:10:44,838 --> 00:10:49,180
whether you're performing a task or just watching someone perform a task.

161
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:55,522
So what that means is just the act of observation or just the act of imagination,

162
00:10:56,082 --> 00:11:00,344
imagining you're observing something, can actually trigger a whole network

163
00:11:00,404 --> 00:11:03,065
that is similar to the network that is triggered when you're moving,

164
00:11:03,685 --> 00:11:08,567
which to some seem like a really clever way, a really clever backdoor

165
00:11:08,687 --> 00:11:12,028
into the nervous system of someone who was in so much pain

166
00:11:12,508 --> 00:11:13,789
that they couldn't even think.

167
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:20,860
about moving. And so a really brilliant scientist by the name of V.S. Ramachandran came up with this

168
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:26,830
idea of mirror box therapy. And so his idea was for people who were missing a limb.

169
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:31,577
So they had what was called phantom limb pain

170
00:11:31,917 --> 00:11:32,658
in their missing limb.

171
00:11:33,938 --> 00:11:37,701
This sensation that the missing limb was still there,

172
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,742
maybe it was itchy, maybe it was cold,

173
00:11:39,962 --> 00:11:40,943
maybe it was in a cramp,

174
00:11:41,483 --> 00:11:42,724
but the point was it was there,

175
00:11:42,844 --> 00:11:44,845
it was hurting or being very, very annoying,

176
00:11:45,265 --> 00:11:46,726
and there was nothing that they could do about it.

177
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,768
And so what V.S. Ramachandran did was he said,

178
00:11:49,828 --> 00:11:55,952
okay, well, I'm gonna put your missing limb into a box.

179
00:11:57,201 --> 00:11:59,566
And I'm also going to put your intact limb over here.

180
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:03,453
And on the side of the box, there's going to be a mirror.

181
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:06,218
And when you look in the mirror, what you're going to

182
00:12:06,238 --> 00:12:08,061
see is the mirror image of your intact limb.

183
00:12:08,748 --> 00:12:10,749
And I want you to start scratching at it.

184
00:12:10,869 --> 00:12:12,449
I want you to start stretching it,

185
00:12:12,549 --> 00:12:13,930
whatever it does to give you relief.

186
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:17,071
And it was elegant, it was wonderful, it was simple.

187
00:12:17,792 --> 00:12:19,192
And it really, really,

188
00:12:19,632 --> 00:12:23,154
in a thousand studies out there now showing

189
00:12:23,174 --> 00:12:24,895
it really, really does help a lot of people

190
00:12:24,935 --> 00:12:26,075
who have phantom limb pain

191
00:12:26,115 --> 00:12:28,816
and other forms of chronic pain.

192
00:12:30,637 --> 00:12:33,338
But, you know, we like to be difficult, so.

193
00:12:34,944 --> 00:12:35,865
It doesn't help everybody.

194
00:12:36,605 --> 00:12:39,887
And we still had a problem because at Mount Sinai,

195
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:43,050
we treat a lot of people with chronic spinal cord injury.

196
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:47,513
And people with spinal cord injury have this condition.

197
00:12:47,553 --> 00:12:51,075
Around 80% of people with chronic spinal cord injury

198
00:12:51,495 --> 00:12:54,537
also have a condition called chronic neuropathic pain.

199
00:12:55,218 --> 00:12:56,879
This is a very,

200
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:04,974
a very upsetting, intractable form of pain that is basically your injured nervous system

201
00:13:05,294 --> 00:13:10,896
telling you that there is something wrong with one or many of your limbs, but there's

202
00:13:10,936 --> 00:13:12,176
actually nothing physically wrong.

203
00:13:12,657 --> 00:13:17,078
So what these people go through on a daily basis, and we see thousands of individuals

204
00:13:17,118 --> 00:13:20,860
with this issue, is at all times, 24-7.

205
00:13:23,822 --> 00:13:29,167
Their brain is telling them that their leg is in a block of ice, or is on fire, or is

206
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:35,253
unbelievably itchy, or there's bugs crawling on it, or just throbbing, and there's nothing

207
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:35,973
they can do about it.

208
00:13:36,454 --> 00:13:40,338
It doesn't respond to pain management, so opioids don't work.

209
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:44,421
They have other sorts of drugs like gabapentin.

210
00:13:45,313 --> 00:13:48,795
They have a varying rate of response,

211
00:13:50,056 --> 00:13:52,358
and less than 30% of people respond

212
00:13:52,538 --> 00:13:54,900
to medications for neuropathic pain.

213
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,122
And Mirabox, as much as it would be great

214
00:13:58,222 --> 00:14:00,123
if we could help these people with Miraboxes,

215
00:14:00,664 --> 00:14:03,346
unfortunately, they lack the basic requisite

216
00:14:03,386 --> 00:14:04,607
for Mirabox therapy to work,

217
00:14:04,647 --> 00:14:06,808
which is the ability to move another limb

218
00:14:07,048 --> 00:14:08,529
that looks like the limb that is hurting.

219
00:14:09,532 --> 00:14:14,896
So that was when we actually started thinking about maybe we could use virtual reality for this.

220
00:14:16,477 --> 00:14:21,682
And it was a pretty simple idea. It seemed logical, right?

221
00:14:22,883 --> 00:14:29,008
So we started playing around with virtual reality and we started creating a bunch of

222
00:14:29,588 --> 00:14:33,631
hand environments and leg environments for people with chronic neuropathic pain.

223
00:14:34,212 --> 00:14:36,854
And I've got to say, humble beginnings.

224
00:14:36,874 --> 00:14:40,718
I'm going to show you guys some pretty embarrassing virtual reality environments here.

225
00:14:41,726 --> 00:14:46,470
But, you know, these were just real simple things that people told us that they missed doing.

226
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:52,794
Playing silly games with a sibling or a friend, playing cards, driving a car.

227
00:14:53,515 --> 00:14:59,539
And we used the cheapest 360 degree camera that money could possibly buy.

228
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:06,565
And we started recording all of these experiences for people so that they could throw on a headset, look down,

229
00:15:07,205 --> 00:15:10,408
and after years and years of not having arms or legs moving,

230
00:15:10,848 --> 00:15:13,570
actually have this experience of their arms and legs moving.

231
00:15:14,711 --> 00:15:18,734
And what we've seen has been really staggering.

232
00:15:18,814 --> 00:15:22,357
So what we've seen in a cohort that keeps growing,

233
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:25,459
so now we're at about 35 or so individuals

234
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,641
who have worked with us on this protocol.

235
00:15:29,442 --> 00:15:30,943
These are all individuals who have had

236
00:15:31,724 --> 00:15:34,506
spinal cord injury for at least five years.

237
00:15:35,046 --> 00:15:37,068
They've been diagnosed with chronic neuropathic pain

238
00:15:37,088 --> 00:15:37,908
this entire time.

239
00:15:38,249 --> 00:15:41,473
They haven't changed anything about their medications for at least six months,

240
00:15:41,513 --> 00:15:43,695
so we know that their symptoms are stable.

241
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:46,979
What we're seeing is that there is on average a 40 percent reduction in

242
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:50,543
their symptoms within 10 minutes of exposure to the virtual reality environment.

243
00:15:51,124 --> 00:15:57,091
So this has been a really impactful intervention for them just off the bat.

244
00:15:58,647 --> 00:16:02,568
And so we're really excited about this because even with a crappy environment,

245
00:16:03,308 --> 00:16:05,749
we can do something. And I'm allowed to call it crappy.

246
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:07,370
You guys aren't allowed to call it crappy, but I am.

247
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:14,532
And, you know, so one of the things that we see as a really strong potential here is

248
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:21,955
this is Woody. He's one of our serial volunteers for every single project that we've ever run.

249
00:16:23,556 --> 00:16:25,436
And one of the ideas is...

250
00:16:26,514 --> 00:16:30,462
Well, any smartphone, Google Cardboard, and let's get this

251
00:16:30,502 --> 00:16:32,666
content on YouTube, and off you go.

252
00:16:33,328 --> 00:16:34,209
So with that in mind.

253
00:16:36,882 --> 00:16:40,003
I want everyone to take this down.

254
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:43,605
We've got a whole bunch more crappy virtual reality

255
00:16:43,645 --> 00:16:47,688
environments on YouTube right now on the Petrino Lab channel.

256
00:16:48,728 --> 00:16:50,709
We're running clinical trials on the East Coast.

257
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:53,411
So if you know anyone on the East Coast who

258
00:16:53,451 --> 00:16:56,012
has a spinal cord injury, who has chronic neuropathic pain,

259
00:16:56,592 --> 00:16:57,873
send them our way.

260
00:16:57,893 --> 00:17:00,534
And I'll put all of our contact details at the end of the talk.

261
00:17:01,235 --> 00:17:03,698
If you know anyone else who is not on the East Coast,

262
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:06,502
who wants to try something out that is non-invasive,

263
00:17:06,903 --> 00:17:10,047
not a medicine, and pretty easy to try out.

264
00:17:10,982 --> 00:17:16,228
just direct them to this YouTube channel, get them a Google Cardboard, and the internet

265
00:17:16,248 --> 00:17:18,230
will do the rest, and fingers crossed.

266
00:17:19,531 --> 00:17:25,157
So what we're doing right now is, now that we've seen some really powerful initial responses

267
00:17:25,197 --> 00:17:30,763
to the virtual reality, we're trying to delve into why the virtual reality works.

268
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:34,246
how we could make better with virtual reality environments,

269
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:38,589
how we can collaborate with people to make really high quality virtual reality environments,

270
00:17:38,649 --> 00:17:40,911
and how to keep it sustainable, and all of those things.

271
00:17:41,692 --> 00:17:44,734
One of the main open questions that we have right now

272
00:17:46,215 --> 00:17:50,398
about virtual reality, which we are currently testing out

273
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:55,583
in the next clinical trial that we begin in May, is why is it working?

274
00:17:55,903 --> 00:18:00,086
So I gave you a whole bunch of theory about why I think it works.

275
00:18:01,127 --> 00:18:04,649
And I hope I haven't biased you because there's another reason why it might work.

276
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:07,811
So the first theory is, of course, maybe we're rebuilding.

277
00:18:07,891 --> 00:18:12,214
So we've got our homunculus with a blurred hand representation.

278
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:16,376
And maybe over time, as you're watching the virtual reality environments

279
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,017
and you're starting to take it all in,

280
00:18:18,438 --> 00:18:21,960
maybe over time that homunculus is being completely repaired.

281
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,604
And that person has regained a healthy relationship with their limb.

282
00:18:29,645 --> 00:18:29,745
And...

283
00:18:30,721 --> 00:18:31,470
They're going to be okay.

284
00:18:32,593 --> 00:18:35,674
But there's also another reason that it might be working,

285
00:18:36,234 --> 00:18:37,354
and it could just be distraction.

286
00:18:37,774 --> 00:18:39,555
So it could just be that we're creating

287
00:18:39,575 --> 00:18:43,416
a home away from home for our viewers

288
00:18:43,876 --> 00:18:45,716
where they just get to think about something

289
00:18:45,776 --> 00:18:46,516
other than their pain,

290
00:18:46,556 --> 00:18:48,037
and it's a very novel experience,

291
00:18:48,677 --> 00:18:50,958
and therefore they feel this relief.

292
00:18:52,378 --> 00:18:54,058
In our initial pilot trials,

293
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,619
what we did was in a repeated,

294
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:58,199
in a crossover design study,

295
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:00,240
we actually exposed people both to

296
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,923
the distractive VR and the somatic VR.

297
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:08,145
So the VR where they were actually watching hands do things,

298
00:19:08,585 --> 00:19:11,247
as well as what we called distractive,

299
00:19:11,287 --> 00:19:13,468
where they couldn't look down and see a body at all,

300
00:19:13,488 --> 00:19:15,049
but they were kind of like a floating eye

301
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,271
going through an aquarium and things like that.

302
00:19:18,832 --> 00:19:21,494
What we saw in our initial data was that

303
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,212
Both of them caused significant pain-relieving effects.

304
00:19:26,852 --> 00:19:28,793
The somatic environment caused more

305
00:19:28,813 --> 00:19:31,635
of a pain-relieving effect, but it wasn't significant yet.

306
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,136
So the next study is to actually expand that

307
00:19:34,796 --> 00:19:39,379
and see if we can see how things piece out over time.

308
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:43,441
The other thing that we hypothesize is that

309
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:47,504
The distraction virtual reality might just be kind of like a band-aid,

310
00:19:47,804 --> 00:19:49,205
and it might stop working over time.

311
00:19:49,285 --> 00:19:54,089
So if you just keep showing someone distractive content,

312
00:19:54,629 --> 00:19:55,810
maybe after a while they're like,

313
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,592
oh yeah, well, virtual reality is kind of old hat to me now,

314
00:19:58,712 --> 00:20:02,335
so I need something even more immersive or more extreme or something like that.

315
00:20:02,795 --> 00:20:04,737
Whereas with the somatic environment,

316
00:20:05,097 --> 00:20:10,221
maybe you actually really are rebuilding a relationship with their hand or their leg

317
00:20:10,441 --> 00:20:13,724
or their painful body part.

318
00:20:14,835 --> 00:20:17,737
The other thing that we're looking into in a lot of detail

319
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:23,961
is trying to understand how certain psychometric properties

320
00:20:24,342 --> 00:20:25,983
of the people who are viewing the VR

321
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:28,304
actually impact their response to the VR.

322
00:20:28,364 --> 00:20:31,026
So again, in the pilot study that we've done,

323
00:20:31,426 --> 00:20:36,890
what we saw was that individuals who rated high

324
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,372
on a scale called the immersive tendency scale,

325
00:20:39,412 --> 00:20:40,913
has anyone ever heard of this scale, by the way?

326
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,261
Couple of people, yeah?

327
00:20:43,881 --> 00:20:44,882
It's really interesting.

328
00:20:45,002 --> 00:20:48,023
It's this scale that actually tries to delve into

329
00:20:48,143 --> 00:20:49,904
how likely you are as a person

330
00:20:49,944 --> 00:20:52,084
to be drawn into a virtual reality environment.

331
00:20:52,425 --> 00:20:54,045
It asks hilarious questions like,

332
00:20:54,425 --> 00:20:56,706
you know, if you're walking through a room and a TV is on,

333
00:20:56,806 --> 00:20:59,227
how likely are you to stop and get drawn into the TV?

334
00:20:59,907 --> 00:21:02,308
You know, how scared do you get after scary movies?

335
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:03,489
Do you need to sleep with the light on

336
00:21:03,549 --> 00:21:05,189
or you just forget about it immediately?

337
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,451
And from that, it tries to get this sort of measure

338
00:21:08,511 --> 00:21:10,711
of how easy it is to immerse you.

339
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:16,646
What we saw was that people who scored high on the immersive tendency questionnaire overall

340
00:21:17,006 --> 00:21:18,967
had better responses to the VR.

341
00:21:19,448 --> 00:21:23,751
But we also saw on a separate questionnaire, which was the presence questionnaire, this

342
00:21:23,811 --> 00:21:28,374
is a questionnaire that says regardless of all that immersive tendency stuff, just how

343
00:21:28,434 --> 00:21:31,836
in the moment were you in the virtual reality environment we showed you.

344
00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:37,730
In that case, and this effect was stronger than the last effect,

345
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,011
people who scored high on the presence questionnaire

346
00:21:40,931 --> 00:21:43,452
had much stronger effects to the virtual reality environment.

347
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,213
So again, what we're trying to do is understand

348
00:21:47,013 --> 00:21:49,954
A, how realistic do we need to get to hook everyone in?

349
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,175
Or how unrealistic do we need to get?

350
00:21:52,235 --> 00:21:55,396
Because actually, one of the things we've been playing around with is like

351
00:21:56,236 --> 00:22:05,238
Rather than trying to perfectly match skin tone and masculinity or femininity of a hand and hairiness and all of these sorts of things,

352
00:22:06,018 --> 00:22:08,078
maybe we just give everyone a blue alien hand.

353
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:13,099
And so, you know, everyone is at a sort of similar level.

354
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:18,440
So these are things that we're playing around with to see what matters, what doesn't,

355
00:22:18,601 --> 00:22:22,721
and how quickly we can scale this experience to sort of draw everybody in.

356
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:27,621
And it's been a really interesting experience

357
00:22:28,521 --> 00:22:30,762
trying to understand how to explore agency

358
00:22:30,802 --> 00:22:32,123
within a virtual reality environment.

359
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:34,784
And we really hope that this is something

360
00:22:34,824 --> 00:22:36,925
that we will be able to scale out

361
00:22:36,965 --> 00:22:38,346
to lots of people who are in pain.

362
00:22:39,226 --> 00:22:40,627
And I can't stress it enough,

363
00:22:40,867 --> 00:22:43,568
lots of people who are in pain at the lowest possible cost

364
00:22:43,689 --> 00:22:46,230
because the populations that we're dealing with

365
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,751
in this case don't have a lot of money to spend

366
00:22:49,091 --> 00:22:52,033
on solutions like this.

367
00:22:52,133 --> 00:22:52,913
So that's why.

368
00:22:53,814 --> 00:22:57,515
Even sometimes we get pushback when we're talking about a Google Cardboard.

369
00:22:57,755 --> 00:22:59,576
That's the sort of demographic that we're dealing with.

370
00:22:59,656 --> 00:23:04,618
So we're really trying to push into ultra low-cost solutions for this

371
00:23:05,198 --> 00:23:07,059
because we really need it right now.

372
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:10,120
So thanks everyone for listening.

373
00:23:10,981 --> 00:23:15,063
All of the work that I've been doing is supported by a lot of amazing people.

374
00:23:15,183 --> 00:23:16,543
It's not just me doing all the work.

375
00:23:17,664 --> 00:23:19,224
And all of those...

376
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:21,425
Things are where you can find us.

377
00:23:22,326 --> 00:23:23,707
We're best at Instagram.

378
00:23:24,607 --> 00:23:25,548
We're okay at Twitter.

379
00:23:26,308 --> 00:23:27,549
We're not so good at Facebook.

380
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:28,929
I think we're too cool for Facebook now,

381
00:23:28,989 --> 00:23:31,571
but you know, don't tell them.

382
00:23:32,231 --> 00:23:32,831
But thanks a lot.

383
00:23:41,696 --> 00:23:43,197
And I think we've got some time for questions.

384
00:23:45,438 --> 00:23:46,319
Yes, I have a question.

385
00:23:46,699 --> 00:23:46,839
Yeah.

386
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,600
I know everybody probably has their pet condition that they would now like you to address, so

387
00:23:52,901 --> 00:23:54,301
I have pretty severe scoliosis.

388
00:23:54,981 --> 00:23:58,102
And of course everybody says, nobody knows what causes it, can't possibly be cured.

389
00:23:58,122 --> 00:24:00,143
All you can do is adapt to it.

390
00:24:00,603 --> 00:24:04,484
Can you think of a way this could be adapted to scoliosis because it affects millions and

391
00:24:04,504 --> 00:24:08,545
millions of people and it's one of those absolute dead ends in terms of the medical profession?

392
00:24:09,853 --> 00:24:18,177
Yeah, so the question was about clever ways that we can treat scoliosis.

393
00:24:18,297 --> 00:24:24,460
My experience with scoliosis, I don't think it's a dead end so much as it is one of those things that

394
00:24:26,718 --> 00:24:36,646
Education and advocacy for real hard work doesn't get enough of a look in.

395
00:24:37,006 --> 00:24:42,570
There's a lot of different causes of scoliosis, and when we're particularly remiss we call

396
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:44,612
it idiopathic because we don't know why it's happening.

397
00:24:44,832 --> 00:24:48,475
It doesn't actually mean that it has no cause, it just means that we don't really understand

398
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:49,456
what's going on.

399
00:24:51,017 --> 00:24:56,699
Currently, the best thing that we have for it is to do very targeted, very personalized

400
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:04,062
exercise therapy for scoliosis to strengthen the muscles that are going to, you know, sort

401
00:25:04,082 --> 00:25:09,344
of push the spine in the other direction, to work on posture, to create environments

402
00:25:09,384 --> 00:25:13,845
where people are constantly being reminded to draw themselves up and do all the right

403
00:25:13,885 --> 00:25:15,186
things for their body.

404
00:25:16,326 --> 00:25:19,427
But the problem is people lose interest in...

405
00:25:20,488 --> 00:25:24,849
interventions like that very, very quickly because it's not a silver bullet.

406
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:27,990
And when I say people, I often mean physicians and clinicians,

407
00:25:28,451 --> 00:25:32,152
because what they really want is to be able to say, here it is, here's the pill,

408
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:36,553
now go away and get better. But that's not the case with scoliosis.

409
00:25:36,593 --> 00:25:42,375
It's a lifelong journey and it needs to be addressed consistently over time.

410
00:25:43,149 --> 00:25:45,511
But so can you see, can you even imagine a VR solution,

411
00:25:45,551 --> 00:25:47,833
something that would help people do that?

412
00:25:47,993 --> 00:25:50,535
I think more than VR,

413
00:25:50,836 --> 00:25:52,697
I don't even think we need to go as far as VR.

414
00:25:52,737 --> 00:25:56,320
I think we just need, you know, RIP Connect,

415
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,442
but we need like motion capture systems

416
00:25:58,562 --> 00:26:01,004
that give people continuous feedback

417
00:26:01,044 --> 00:26:05,308
about how they're moving, walk them through exercises.

418
00:26:05,448 --> 00:26:06,789
This is a perfect example of a,

419
00:26:08,971 --> 00:26:13,315
A condition that would benefit from having daily exercises in front of a motion capture

420
00:26:13,335 --> 00:26:18,720
camera that tells you exactly if you're doing the exercise correctly and if you're maintaining

421
00:26:19,241 --> 00:26:20,221
good posture and good form.

422
00:26:20,547 --> 00:26:22,048
And how cheap are those cameras right now?

423
00:26:22,129 --> 00:26:23,370
Well, they just got discontinued.

424
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,390
So they used to be about $250.

425
00:26:24,951 --> 00:26:30,275
But now they're on eBay, like $800 or $1,000 if you're lucky.

426
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:33,078
But Kinect said they are coming out with a Kinect 3.

427
00:26:33,418 --> 00:26:35,119
So we'll cross our fingers.

428
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:38,923
And if the Microsoft gods are listening, we'll see how we go.

429
00:26:39,463 --> 00:26:40,104
Thank you.

430
00:26:40,324 --> 00:26:40,644
No worries.

431
00:26:41,345 --> 00:26:44,247
This is sort of amazing, because I'm currently developing

432
00:26:44,407 --> 00:26:45,668
a real-time motion capture.

433
00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:49,369
virtual, somatic visualization system.

434
00:26:49,469 --> 00:26:52,610
But we're deliberately taking an approach

435
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:54,830
that does not use VR headsets,

436
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,251
partially for inclusivity, partially,

437
00:26:57,831 --> 00:26:58,591
well there are many reasons,

438
00:26:58,631 --> 00:27:01,211
but I personally don't like to sweat in a VR goggle,

439
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:04,472
but we're deliberately rendering the body

440
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:09,213
that you see in an abstracted impressionistic way

441
00:27:09,293 --> 00:27:10,793
so that we don't generate negative

442
00:27:11,894 --> 00:27:15,676
So, you know, idealizing ourselves in ways that are not really healthy.

443
00:27:16,957 --> 00:27:21,339
But I wondered, would you comment, do you think all of this sort of research is equally

444
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:25,182
applicable to a non-VR but still somewhat immersive system?

445
00:27:25,502 --> 00:27:27,283
I absolutely do.

446
00:27:27,523 --> 00:27:32,326
And one of our control conditions is actually viewing...

447
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:35,143
just in a 2D screen.

448
00:27:35,523 --> 00:27:38,684
Because if we can do this in 2D, let's do this in 2D.

449
00:27:38,704 --> 00:27:40,145
I totally agree.

450
00:27:40,405 --> 00:27:42,865
I would love to talk to you about possibly being a consultant.

451
00:27:43,005 --> 00:27:44,386
Yeah, for sure.

452
00:27:44,506 --> 00:27:45,266
Thank you so much.

453
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:48,847
On your website, do you have information about patients?

454
00:27:48,907 --> 00:27:51,408
Like, what are the requirements to be a patient?

455
00:27:52,099 --> 00:27:58,307
Yes, so on the website you can link to all of the clinical trials.

456
00:27:58,387 --> 00:28:06,537
The VR clinical trial is already up on clinicaltrials.gov, which will tell you exactly how to, you know,

457
00:28:07,358 --> 00:28:11,462
who uh what our recruitment criteria are and who can be a who can be a patient. So you can be

458
00:28:11,502 --> 00:28:16,466
functioning like I have a spinal injury I take medicine every day all the tingling burning but

459
00:28:16,626 --> 00:28:20,790
I'm not in a wheelchair. I can still that's fine that's fine any anyone with a diagnosed

460
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:27,535
spinal cord injury who experiences neuropathic pain welcome in the trial thanks. Hey I was just

461
00:28:27,575 --> 00:28:31,539
curious if like player interaction has been like an accelerator something that you've uh

462
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:34,742
experimented with or seen. Say that again sorry.

463
00:28:35,321 --> 00:28:40,924
Player interaction has been like an accelerator for rehabilitation. Have you noticed any differences?

464
00:28:43,285 --> 00:28:44,825
Player interaction as in like...

465
00:28:47,607 --> 00:28:53,989
Oh, I see what you're saying. Yes, sorry. So all of the trials we've done thus far have been passive.

466
00:28:54,965 --> 00:29:00,906
visualization, simply because we wanted to create the most inclusive experience for

467
00:29:01,586 --> 00:29:04,707
everyone with spinal cord injury, and we have a lot of people with spinal cord injury who

468
00:29:04,727 --> 00:29:05,707
can't move.

469
00:29:07,188 --> 00:29:13,749
But we have done a lot of work with gamified environments in the past, and we've seen really

470
00:29:13,809 --> 00:29:18,151
positive results in improving motor function and things of that nature.

471
00:29:18,311 --> 00:29:20,931
In fact, we've seen them outperform conventional care.

472
00:29:21,671 --> 00:29:21,892
Thank you.

473
00:29:23,121 --> 00:29:25,422
So these have all been a lot better questions than mine,

474
00:29:25,462 --> 00:29:27,903
but mine's more on FDA regulation

475
00:29:28,263 --> 00:29:30,744
and moving forward with FDA regulation.

476
00:29:31,285 --> 00:29:34,346
I know that eventually, if you're planning to get this

477
00:29:34,446 --> 00:29:37,007
into a patient market in the hospital,

478
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:40,148
how would you move forward with the FDA regulation

479
00:29:40,328 --> 00:29:41,689
if you haven't already and if you have?

480
00:29:42,309 --> 00:29:44,610
Yeah, so I think it's a great question.

481
00:29:45,011 --> 00:29:47,171
I think we've always got to be mindful

482
00:29:47,211 --> 00:29:47,992
of these sorts of things.

483
00:29:50,557 --> 00:29:56,699
You know, when it comes to regulation of technologies like this, it really does just come down to

484
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:59,820
A, what are you charging for it?

485
00:30:00,161 --> 00:30:06,383
So in a case where we're not charging anything for it, you know, and it's not particularly

486
00:30:06,403 --> 00:30:09,264
a high risk intervention, it's just watching videos.

487
00:30:10,305 --> 00:30:10,865
Take care.

488
00:30:11,565 --> 00:30:12,406
Give good instruction.

489
00:30:14,155 --> 00:30:16,458
and don't do anything foolish.

490
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:21,364
When it comes to actually charging for something like this,

491
00:30:21,404 --> 00:30:23,667
so let's say we wanted to start a business,

492
00:30:26,411 --> 00:30:30,056
I think that just by creating content...

493
00:30:31,276 --> 00:30:35,538
I think, you know, if there's anyone out there listening who wants to create a business out

494
00:30:35,558 --> 00:30:39,961
of this, do VR Netflix and don't make any claims about it.

495
00:30:40,121 --> 00:30:41,962
Don't tell people it's going to, you know...

496
00:30:43,813 --> 00:30:46,276
revolutionize their pain management.

497
00:30:47,737 --> 00:30:48,879
But do put it out there.

498
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:51,742
If you have 100 people sending you in videos

499
00:30:51,782 --> 00:30:53,564
saying it's completely changed their life,

500
00:30:54,024 --> 00:30:55,065
put those on your website

501
00:30:55,806 --> 00:30:57,708
and don't make any claims yourself.

502
00:30:58,509 --> 00:30:59,390
And off you go.

503
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:01,052
Again, it's not a very...

504
00:31:02,734 --> 00:31:05,897
a high-risk thing that we're talking about here,

505
00:31:06,138 --> 00:31:10,122
and there should be no reason for the FDA

506
00:31:10,162 --> 00:31:12,424
to try and block you creating a repository

507
00:31:12,464 --> 00:31:14,927
of content of limbs doing things.

508
00:31:15,728 --> 00:31:17,910
That can be viewed from a third-person point of view,

509
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:19,312
so long as you're not assigning

510
00:31:19,432 --> 00:31:21,394
any sort of therapeutic intent to it.

511
00:31:23,999 --> 00:31:28,241
Once you get enough pilot data to actually show that you're making a difference,

512
00:31:29,062 --> 00:31:33,145
different story. Go to the FDA, get an indication, because then insurance can cover it.

513
00:31:33,205 --> 00:31:37,468
Then you can actually start to get doctors prescribing it and all those sorts of things.

514
00:31:37,548 --> 00:31:41,891
And that's where you can start to scale more rapidly.

515
00:31:42,011 --> 00:31:46,454
But in the early stages, it's just content. You're just making content.

516
00:31:48,075 --> 00:31:50,736
If you have time afterwards, I'd also love to talk to you a little bit more about that.

517
00:31:51,017 --> 00:31:51,737
Sure. Thank you.

518
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:54,440
Hi.

519
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,180
Kind of made me nervous.

520
00:31:58,101 --> 00:31:59,341
So I'm from the FDA.

521
00:32:05,143 --> 00:32:08,644
I'm part of a new initiative for going

522
00:32:08,684 --> 00:32:10,144
towards medical mixed reality.

523
00:32:10,284 --> 00:32:13,705
And so actually we have a collaboration

524
00:32:13,785 --> 00:32:15,265
with MedStar Rehabilitation.

525
00:32:15,345 --> 00:32:17,226
We actually last week just talked to.

526
00:32:18,852 --> 00:32:22,834
The PT's working with patients with spinal cord injuries.

527
00:32:22,994 --> 00:32:25,955
And one thing that they mentioned

528
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:29,137
is for the patients who are younger,

529
00:32:29,237 --> 00:32:31,678
it's so easy to get them in VR.

530
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:39,741
But for the, they said they had a 56-year-old woman who

531
00:32:39,821 --> 00:32:41,122
they put her in VR.

532
00:32:41,442 --> 00:32:44,784
And in five minutes, she came out and she says,

533
00:32:44,964 --> 00:32:45,464
that was great.

534
00:32:45,584 --> 00:32:45,944
I loved it.

535
00:32:46,703 --> 00:32:48,805
But that was her VR experience.

536
00:32:48,845 --> 00:32:52,608
They offered to put her in some different kinds of games,

537
00:32:52,688 --> 00:32:55,470
but she was like, no, that was good.

538
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:56,951
That was my VR experience.

539
00:32:56,971 --> 00:32:58,633
So what would you recommend?

540
00:32:58,693 --> 00:33:02,175
How can we get more patients in VR?

541
00:33:03,677 --> 00:33:03,857
Yeah.

542
00:33:04,257 --> 00:33:04,417
Cool.

543
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:06,159
So first of all, I just want to say

544
00:33:06,219 --> 00:33:07,560
that for the last 10 minutes,

545
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,701
I've just totally blacked out.

546
00:33:08,741 --> 00:33:10,362
So I don't know anything that I just said.

547
00:33:11,783 --> 00:33:12,884
Can't be held responsible for it.

548
00:33:18,153 --> 00:33:20,414
But secondly, I think it's a great question,

549
00:33:20,494 --> 00:33:25,497
and I think there's no silver bullet for any condition,

550
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:27,878
least of all pain.

551
00:33:28,958 --> 00:33:31,219
I was having a conversation with a VC

552
00:33:31,239 --> 00:33:33,901
the other day about another pain intervention that.

553
00:33:34,421 --> 00:33:37,063
We're running through clinical trials in my lab and the VC said,

554
00:33:37,524 --> 00:33:43,148
I only want to invest if it's definitely going to work on at least 80% of pain patients.

555
00:33:43,329 --> 00:33:48,813
And I said, well, then don't invest in anything in pain because that's just not a reasonable thing to experience.

556
00:33:49,013 --> 00:33:56,540
And we have the same in all aspects of rehabilitation, whether it be robotic rehabilitation.

557
00:33:57,216 --> 00:34:01,358
or gamified rehabilitation with motion capture,

558
00:34:01,518 --> 00:34:06,181
or just regular old conventional OTPT.

559
00:34:06,981 --> 00:34:08,682
Some people respond, other people don't.

560
00:34:08,842 --> 00:34:11,343
Some people have preferences, go with their preferences.

561
00:34:12,104 --> 00:34:14,625
The way that we really like to compare it

562
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:16,366
is athletic performance.

563
00:34:16,586 --> 00:34:18,827
In our lab, we work with a lot of high-performance athletes.

564
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:25,945
When I have a world champion athlete that doesn't want to do a certain exercise, I find a different exercise for them.

565
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:30,648
I don't say, oh, well, stick with it because I'm the coach. That doesn't fly.

566
00:34:31,328 --> 00:34:37,532
And we should keep that frame with all of our patients because when they're telling you this isn't doing much for me,

567
00:34:38,092 --> 00:34:46,917
well, what that is telling me is I know I need thousands of hours of intentional work to get a satisfactory outcome.

568
00:34:47,658 --> 00:34:47,738
And.

569
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:51,924
If they're not feeling it from the first session, I've got to do something else with them,

570
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:54,408
because I know right there and then it's not going to work.

571
00:34:55,109 --> 00:34:56,531
Okay, we're out of time.

572
00:34:56,552 --> 00:35:00,999
Okay, we'll go gather in the hall. Thank you everyone. Thanks for listening.
