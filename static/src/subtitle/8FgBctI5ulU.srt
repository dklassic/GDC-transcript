1
00:00:06,848 --> 00:00:12,090
We can get started. So first, and also thank you for coming bright and early in the morning.

2
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:19,492
So great to see so many happy smiling faces. My name is Molly Maloney and I am a narrative

3
00:00:19,532 --> 00:00:24,154
designer for Telltale Games and this is Writing a Narrative Design Relationship.

4
00:00:24,514 --> 00:00:29,236
And my name is Eric Sterpe. I'm a writer also at Telltale Games and both of us have been at Telltale

5
00:00:29,276 --> 00:00:33,678
going on five years this year. We actually met on the job and started dating going on like four

6
00:00:33,698 --> 00:00:35,658
years ago now. We're getting married.

7
00:00:36,395 --> 00:00:36,655
True.

8
00:00:38,917 --> 00:00:39,378
Thank you.

9
00:00:39,398 --> 00:00:41,320
Thank you.

10
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,523
Yeah, no, the wedding's coming up in June, and if you're curious about whether planning

11
00:00:44,563 --> 00:00:46,906
a GDC talk and a wedding at the same time is stressful...

12
00:00:47,146 --> 00:00:49,608
Oh my god, like, I'm not gonna...

13
00:00:49,688 --> 00:00:53,092
I do not regret it, but we didn't plan ahead, I would say.

14
00:00:53,112 --> 00:00:55,174
No, the timing was a little stressful, but...

15
00:00:56,027 --> 00:00:58,928
but we have we prefer discussing the idea for this talk based on a lot of

16
00:00:58,968 --> 00:01:01,869
conversations that we were having with other people you know i'm a writer she's

17
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:04,889
a narrative designer with the difference between those that tell tale what's it

18
00:01:04,929 --> 00:01:07,770
like working with the person you're dating it turned out when you're dating

19
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:11,011
the person you work with people the lot of questions for you all that must be

20
00:01:11,051 --> 00:01:15,432
amazing all that i'm so sorry and uh... we started realizing that there were a

21
00:01:15,472 --> 00:01:18,233
lot of parallels uh... between the two subjects and uh... kind of where the

22
00:01:18,253 --> 00:01:19,373
stock started coming together from

23
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:25,408
So, really quick before we dive in, what we're going to be discussing in this talk, basically

24
00:01:25,528 --> 00:01:30,709
what is the difference between narrative design and writing, specifically through the Telltale

25
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:31,850
lens because that's where we work.

26
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,971
How the two are mutually beneficial and can add a ton to your game, make it better, and

27
00:01:37,011 --> 00:01:41,312
then just tips and tricks for getting the most out of a writing and narrative design

28
00:01:41,372 --> 00:01:41,712
team.

29
00:01:42,752 --> 00:01:43,673
So, let's dive in.

30
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,582
First off, let's talk about what exactly the difference

31
00:01:48,662 --> 00:01:52,003
between narrative and, blah, blah, blah, it's the morning.

32
00:01:52,644 --> 00:01:54,585
What's the difference between narrative design and writing?

33
00:01:54,605 --> 00:01:56,646
Yeah, it's a question that still comes up a lot,

34
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:58,447
I think especially because narrative design

35
00:01:58,487 --> 00:02:00,528
is a role that's still sort of being defined

36
00:02:00,548 --> 00:02:01,949
in the video game industry at large.

37
00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:04,270
Yeah, I like to joke that if you ask

38
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,431
four different narrative designers what their job is,

39
00:02:06,912 --> 00:02:08,252
you get four different answers,

40
00:02:08,472 --> 00:02:10,854
and it's not even a joke, I actually did ask four.

41
00:02:11,234 --> 00:02:13,555
So, it's crazy, everybody will tell you something different.

42
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:18,912
Yeah, and it doesn't help that writing and narrative design are terms that sometimes

43
00:02:18,952 --> 00:02:20,594
get tossed around interchangeably these days.

44
00:02:20,714 --> 00:02:23,116
But at Telltale, the two roles are currently distinct.

45
00:02:23,456 --> 00:02:28,740
And our philosophy is that writing and narrative design, those are two big jobs, and asking

46
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,763
one person to undertake both of them, I'm not saying you can't do it, but why not let

47
00:02:32,823 --> 00:02:37,407
two people do one thing really well, then ask one person to stretch themselves across

48
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:38,447
two different disciplines.

49
00:02:38,748 --> 00:02:40,629
Yeah, so let's talk about what that looks like specifically.

50
00:02:41,974 --> 00:02:47,136
So the simple definition that we like to use at work is writing is responsible for the characters

51
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,777
and design is responsible for the player.

52
00:02:50,997 --> 00:02:55,378
And that's a really simplified way to view it, but it actually has been very useful for us

53
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,579
because it provides a lens through which each

54
00:02:57,619 --> 00:02:59,920
of those disciplines can really focus their energy.

55
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,541
Yeah. And so on the writing side of things, that looks like you've got your dialogue,

56
00:03:03,561 --> 00:03:04,862
which is what your characters are saying.

57
00:03:04,882 --> 00:03:07,802
You have your character arcs, which is how the characters are growing and changing

58
00:03:07,842 --> 00:03:08,743
over the course of the story.

59
00:03:09,413 --> 00:03:10,754
And then you have your themes and tone,

60
00:03:10,854 --> 00:03:12,295
which this is the most subjective of these,

61
00:03:12,315 --> 00:03:14,055
but it basically means that if you're making a comedy,

62
00:03:14,175 --> 00:03:15,396
make it funny, if you're making a drama,

63
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:16,856
make sure you're really tugging the heartstrings.

64
00:03:17,977 --> 00:03:21,338
For the design side, what this looks like at Telltale

65
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:24,299
is choices and consequences are a big part.

66
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:27,641
And that is, is the player making enough choices?

67
00:03:27,921 --> 00:03:29,141
Do they feel good in the moment?

68
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:30,682
Are they paying off down the line?

69
00:03:31,782 --> 00:03:32,863
Next, we've got branching.

70
00:03:33,683 --> 00:03:35,524
Is the player experiencing unique content

71
00:03:35,604 --> 00:03:36,364
and do they know it?

72
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:42,343
And then finally, mechanics, which is historically spearheaded by narrative design at Telltale,

73
00:03:42,363 --> 00:03:47,747
but it really prevents your mini-games or your mechanics from feeling different or out of place

74
00:03:47,787 --> 00:03:51,309
with the narrative. And so an important thing to note is that none of these say that writing is

75
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:55,471
the one responsible for the story, because what makes the relationship between writing and design

76
00:03:55,491 --> 00:03:58,893
super unique at Telltale is that writing and design are sharing that story as a deliverable.

77
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:02,295
And, you know, because it doesn't matter how much agency your player has if they don't fall in love

78
00:04:02,315 --> 00:04:05,357
with the story and characters. Yeah. And so...

79
00:04:06,352 --> 00:04:10,134
I also find that what's really great about this is that you've also got two people who

80
00:04:10,254 --> 00:04:12,155
are responsible for the story.

81
00:04:12,175 --> 00:04:15,556
So that means you can have the story holders be in two places at one time.

82
00:04:15,957 --> 00:04:21,820
So while Eric is feverishly locked in a broom closet writing or whatever, I can run around

83
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,122
and actually talk to people, evangelize what's going on, keep people up to date, ramp up

84
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:29,444
other departments, work on my own stuff, of which there's a ton.

85
00:04:29,464 --> 00:04:32,966
And being able to be in those two places at once is really awesome, because again, the

86
00:04:32,986 --> 00:04:34,646
writer will be doing a lot of time locked away.

87
00:04:35,374 --> 00:04:37,536
So let's get more practical with this.

88
00:04:37,917 --> 00:04:39,239
Yeah, because with all the stuff you're saying,

89
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:40,460
this sounds like writing and design

90
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,002
don't need to actually have a relationship at all.

91
00:04:42,042 --> 00:04:43,825
You could just divide up the work and call it a day,

92
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:46,488
like in this classic example from the highly topical

93
00:04:46,668 --> 00:04:47,770
reference of the Brady Bunch.

94
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:51,395
He's always trying to get me to watch the show with him.

95
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,732
Just looking at that previous slide, not this Brady Bunch,

96
00:04:57,473 --> 00:05:00,035
the one from a couple before where we've got like those two

97
00:05:00,095 --> 00:05:00,896
categories, right?

98
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:03,598
It would be so easy to say, OK, that's

99
00:05:03,658 --> 00:05:07,281
pretty cut and dry breakdown of responsibilities.

100
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,443
Like, this is my piece of pie, and this is your piece of pie,

101
00:05:10,484 --> 00:05:12,245
and never the two shall touch.

102
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,488
But those roles, I like to think of them more

103
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:19,151
as a starting place, not a paint by numbers thing

104
00:05:19,191 --> 00:05:21,532
on the balance of power or responsibility,

105
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:21,893
because.

106
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:25,325
Writing a narrative design, you know, we might have different responsibilities,

107
00:05:25,385 --> 00:05:28,227
but we share a goal, which is to make a great game together.

108
00:05:28,547 --> 00:05:32,150
And fundamentally, it just doesn't get that cut and dry.

109
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,491
You're going to step on each other's toes in the process.

110
00:05:34,892 --> 00:05:37,493
Yeah. And it's like how you wouldn't have those kind of cut and dry responsibilities

111
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:38,714
in a personal relationship either.

112
00:05:38,734 --> 00:05:42,617
You know, like let's say, for instance, Molly went out of town and doing dishes was her job.

113
00:05:42,957 --> 00:05:46,400
You know, if she got back and there was a sink of dishes waiting for her because that's her job.

114
00:05:47,188 --> 00:05:47,889
She would kill me.

115
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:48,969
I would kill him.

116
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:49,490
I'd be dead.

117
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,872
Actually, what's funny is that I have done this to him many, many times.

118
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,254
But I try not to do it to my writing partner.

119
00:05:56,355 --> 00:06:00,237
Yeah, and I preferably not, you know, you don't do it to your designer either.

120
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:01,979
Yeah, exactly.

121
00:06:02,619 --> 00:06:07,723
So, but really, like jokes aside, like dividing up the responsibilities of who's responsible for what,

122
00:06:08,203 --> 00:06:12,146
I find historically it can lead to a lot of false senses of ownership

123
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:15,509
and also just resentment, possessiveness, and feuding.

124
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:15,809
Yeah.

125
00:06:17,074 --> 00:06:17,835
and killing people.

126
00:06:19,015 --> 00:06:22,036
So with that in mind, let's just go through the process

127
00:06:22,076 --> 00:06:24,477
at Telltale and see how the balance evolves

128
00:06:24,577 --> 00:06:26,678
over the course of making an actual episode.

129
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,038
So first up is pre-production, which

130
00:06:29,118 --> 00:06:31,199
this is the writer and designer alone on the episode.

131
00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:33,480
And it's putting together the outline and initial story.

132
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,741
And we've been talking about the differences

133
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:37,001
between writing and narrative design,

134
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,322
the differences in responsibilities.

135
00:06:38,382 --> 00:06:39,782
But what's interesting is at this point,

136
00:06:39,802 --> 00:06:41,563
there's not a ton of difference in what you guys are

137
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:42,503
doing from the outside.

138
00:06:42,523 --> 00:06:43,964
Because it's going to be a lot of you sitting around,

139
00:06:44,064 --> 00:06:44,824
talking, and thinking.

140
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:50,465
Yeah, functionally, it's just a lot of whiteboard time or coffee shop time or whatever you like to do.

141
00:06:50,485 --> 00:06:52,969
And it looks a lot like this image.

142
00:06:53,309 --> 00:06:57,495
You've got your writer and your narrative designer kind of locked in a room bouncing ideas off of each other.

143
00:06:57,635 --> 00:07:02,421
I really think the only thing it's missing is like just out of frame, a producer holding a baseball bat.

144
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:06,731
Because fun fact, you can put story and things on a Gantt chart.

145
00:07:07,711 --> 00:07:09,132
Creativity is a deliverable.

146
00:07:09,272 --> 00:07:11,972
Yeah, and so the thing that is different between the two of you at this phase

147
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:13,012
is what you're focusing on.

148
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:15,853
Because like we were talking about before, you know, writing is focusing on making that,

149
00:07:16,413 --> 00:07:19,214
you know, making the story compelling and making the character journey feel really good.

150
00:07:19,594 --> 00:07:23,075
And design is responsible for making that story really fun and playable.

151
00:07:23,395 --> 00:07:24,295
Yeah.

152
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:27,155
So we had a great example of this on an episode of Minecraft Story Mode

153
00:07:27,175 --> 00:07:28,176
that we were working on together.

154
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,816
Now, this didn't get made for various reasons, but I had this idea for the player character

155
00:07:31,836 --> 00:07:32,377
in Minecraft Story Mode.

156
00:07:32,662 --> 00:07:37,206
I wanted him to have a job where all he would do all day was craft sticks for other cooler

157
00:07:37,266 --> 00:07:37,526
heroes.

158
00:07:37,546 --> 00:07:38,607
That was all he would do all day.

159
00:07:38,647 --> 00:07:41,270
He was going to start off bored and hating his life, but he was going to be destined

160
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,290
for greatness by the end.

161
00:07:42,611 --> 00:07:44,753
So I stopped listening and bored and hating his life.

162
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,934
Like this is a design nightmare for me.

163
00:07:47,035 --> 00:07:48,636
Like this guy is going to be bored?

164
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:50,337
Like how do I turn that into a mechanic?

165
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:51,098
Right.

166
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:54,141
But the thing that I loved about it was that if you have a character who starts out bored

167
00:07:54,181 --> 00:07:56,903
and hating their life, then you know what their trajectory is going to be over the course

168
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:57,383
of the story.

169
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:03,502
Yeah, I think that trajectory is going to take them immediately to the player uninstalling the game.

170
00:08:04,382 --> 00:08:10,185
But no, seriously, it's not like this is a movie where we can just show a montage and be like,

171
00:08:10,265 --> 00:08:13,026
okay, he hates his life, but don't worry, it's going to get really good later.

172
00:08:13,486 --> 00:08:16,828
Right. So I heard what Molly was saying and tried to find a way to punch it up. So I said, okay,

173
00:08:17,268 --> 00:08:22,711
what if he's super positive about making sticks? I said, what if he's an optimist in spite of

174
00:08:22,931 --> 00:08:24,852
having to make sticks all day? He's not going to let that get him down.

175
00:08:26,082 --> 00:08:26,943
This is a kids game, by the way.

176
00:08:26,963 --> 00:08:28,563
I don't know if you do that part.

177
00:08:28,804 --> 00:08:32,085
So that shifting of Eric's point of view,

178
00:08:32,105 --> 00:08:34,386
his willing to kind of bend on these ideas,

179
00:08:34,486 --> 00:08:35,847
it really helped me out a lot.

180
00:08:35,927 --> 00:08:37,288
All of a sudden, we have this character.

181
00:08:38,188 --> 00:08:40,749
They might be miserable, but they're also super passionate

182
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,410
about their crappy job.

183
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,731
And that really gave me an inroad as a designer,

184
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:45,612
where I'm like, OK.

185
00:08:46,352 --> 00:08:49,394
So we designed this super kind of over-the-top mechanic

186
00:08:49,434 --> 00:08:52,795
around it, where it was almost like this DDR-esque thing,

187
00:08:53,055 --> 00:08:54,116
where it was like you're crafting

188
00:08:54,136 --> 00:08:55,016
these sticks in Minecraft.

189
00:08:55,036 --> 00:08:55,497
And it was like this.

190
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,189
Awesome! Good job! Kapow!

191
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,891
Epic sticks.

192
00:09:00,731 --> 00:09:03,633
And it was fun and it was funny and we actually laughed a lot.

193
00:09:03,853 --> 00:09:06,595
And it didn't get made for completely different reasons.

194
00:09:06,735 --> 00:09:11,158
But what really was great about it was Eric still got what he wanted.

195
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:13,760
This character still wanted to get away from his boring job.

196
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,262
But we had a mechanic that was actually fun to play.

197
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,723
Yeah, so we had the character arcs that ended up being super fun.

198
00:09:18,804 --> 00:09:21,205
And it was a really great example of writing and design,

199
00:09:21,225 --> 00:09:23,187
kind of whacking that ball back and forth, being collaborative.

200
00:09:23,627 --> 00:09:24,968
Which is how it should be.

201
00:09:25,412 --> 00:09:27,373
except it doesn't always go that smoothly.

202
00:09:27,473 --> 00:09:27,933
No.

203
00:09:27,953 --> 00:09:27,993
No.

204
00:09:28,914 --> 00:09:31,075
Yeah, because developing that healthy level of collaboration

205
00:09:31,095 --> 00:09:32,036
takes time and trust.

206
00:09:32,216 --> 00:09:33,737
And if your partner is going to have ideas,

207
00:09:33,757 --> 00:09:35,719
your partner is going to have ideas that you don't always

208
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:36,179
agree with.

209
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:39,241
So let's talk about what happens when writing and design

210
00:09:39,261 --> 00:09:41,422
disagree about an idea during pre-production,

211
00:09:41,503 --> 00:09:41,823
because

212
00:09:42,437 --> 00:09:43,298
It happens a lot.

213
00:09:43,498 --> 00:09:43,698
Yeah.

214
00:09:43,818 --> 00:09:45,419
And if your partner's pitching and loving an idea

215
00:09:45,439 --> 00:09:47,060
that you don't like, it's really critical

216
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,920
that you keep it on the same page as soon as possible.

217
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:51,001
And in our experience, we've seen

218
00:09:51,021 --> 00:09:53,583
that there are certain red flags or bad habits

219
00:09:53,623 --> 00:09:55,304
that we've seen that are really not the correct way

220
00:09:55,384 --> 00:09:56,244
to handle disagreements.

221
00:09:57,245 --> 00:09:59,946
So I'm going to talk about our first bad habit.

222
00:10:00,006 --> 00:10:00,766
We have two.

223
00:10:01,347 --> 00:10:04,428
But basically, fundamentally, bad habits, in my opinion,

224
00:10:04,468 --> 00:10:07,109
boil down to overcommunication or undercommunication.

225
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:07,530
So click.

226
00:10:10,034 --> 00:10:13,656
There are some people who I find dislike confrontation.

227
00:10:14,037 --> 00:10:16,138
And when they hear an idea that they don't like,

228
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,580
they just nod in agreement to everything that you're saying,

229
00:10:19,961 --> 00:10:22,382
secretly hating it and hoping that somebody else,

230
00:10:22,603 --> 00:10:24,824
anybody else will kill it instead of them

231
00:10:25,044 --> 00:10:26,545
because they hate confrontation.

232
00:10:26,705 --> 00:10:29,267
Like, I feel like everybody knows somebody like this.

233
00:10:31,489 --> 00:10:33,750
Everybody knows somebody like this.

234
00:10:34,162 --> 00:10:36,764
I mean it's me, in case you didn't get the hint there.

235
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:39,726
But this one has really bitten me in the butt a lot in the past.

236
00:10:39,846 --> 00:10:42,168
I was working on an episode of Telltale's Batman series.

237
00:10:42,828 --> 00:10:44,910
And I told people that there was a scene that I'd write

238
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,751
in a particular way that higher-ups were asking for.

239
00:10:47,331 --> 00:10:48,572
And even though I really didn't think

240
00:10:48,592 --> 00:10:49,673
it was going to be the best way to do it,

241
00:10:49,693 --> 00:10:50,934
and I had a better idea in my mind,

242
00:10:50,974 --> 00:10:52,235
but I really didn't want to rock the boat.

243
00:10:52,255 --> 00:10:53,996
So I said, OK, I'll write it the way they want it.

244
00:10:54,056 --> 00:10:55,097
I'll wait till table read.

245
00:10:55,117 --> 00:10:56,037
Someone else will shut it down.

246
00:10:56,057 --> 00:10:57,478
And then I'll get to fix it the way that I want to.

247
00:10:57,879 --> 00:10:59,059
A victimless crime.

248
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,801
Right, there's supposed to be no victims.

249
00:11:00,821 --> 00:11:02,161
There's supposed to be no bad guys.

250
00:11:02,685 --> 00:11:04,026
What's that? The problem with the scene?

251
00:11:04,807 --> 00:11:06,729
What? No bad guys in a Batman episode?

252
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:08,690
Anyway, so Table Read comes

253
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,592
and sure enough we get to the scene, people

254
00:11:10,632 --> 00:11:12,634
don't like it, but when it came time

255
00:11:12,674 --> 00:11:14,795
to fix it, they asked someone else to do it.

256
00:11:15,076 --> 00:11:17,057
So I didn't even get to fix it like I wanted to.

257
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:18,699
And the big lesson I learned

258
00:11:18,739 --> 00:11:20,640
is that staying silent about the things you don't

259
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,702
like, it's never the right answer. In fact

260
00:11:22,742 --> 00:11:24,763
holding your tongue, it's just going to hurt the rest of your team,

261
00:11:24,783 --> 00:11:26,605
it's going to hurt you, and if you're not careful

262
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:27,626
it could hurt the game in the end.

263
00:11:28,446 --> 00:11:31,688
And I don't know if you're picking up on this yet from my overall vibe, but that's kind

264
00:11:31,748 --> 00:11:33,329
of me in life too, not just work.

265
00:11:33,349 --> 00:11:37,071
Like I'm not a huge confrontation guy, a confronter.

266
00:11:38,992 --> 00:11:40,033
You're a lover, not a fighter.

267
00:11:40,613 --> 00:11:44,816
Which I would say is a really great transition to the other side of the spectrum.

268
00:11:45,096 --> 00:11:46,397
Yeah.

269
00:11:46,437 --> 00:11:49,518
Yeah, because it turns out there are people who don't have a problem with confrontation.

270
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:51,800
You might say even like confrontation.

271
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,601
I like to call it communication.

272
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:54,921
But whatever.

273
00:11:55,261 --> 00:11:57,382
I want the record to show I wasn't saying it was about her.

274
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,984
But there's a designer that I've worked with before,

275
00:12:00,084 --> 00:12:01,965
who maybe when they hear an idea they don't like,

276
00:12:04,607 --> 00:12:05,708
they might have a hard time.

277
00:12:06,228 --> 00:12:07,829
I object to the use of this channel.

278
00:12:07,909 --> 00:12:09,710
They have a hard time hiding how they feel about it.

279
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,172
You know, she or he gets hung up on it

280
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:14,794
and comes back to it over and over and over and over

281
00:12:14,814 --> 00:12:16,555
and over again until they kill it dead,

282
00:12:16,655 --> 00:12:18,696
even if it derails other conversations.

283
00:12:19,797 --> 00:12:21,998
So yeah, this one is definitely me.

284
00:12:23,298 --> 00:12:27,420
I like to call it hypercommunication, which I feel like is a good rebranding.

285
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,282
But I really communicate a lot by nature.

286
00:12:31,442 --> 00:12:34,603
And if something is wrong, I want to see that stuff fixed right now.

287
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,102
Like, in my opinion, like, the longer a bad idea persists, the more people hear about it.

288
00:12:41,122 --> 00:12:44,425
You just want to nip it in the bud. And functionally, that's a great place to come

289
00:12:44,645 --> 00:12:48,708
at it from, but practically, it's not. It's just not useful in the room.

290
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:52,872
And there were a couple of things that I've had to really work on over time to improve on this

291
00:12:52,952 --> 00:12:57,035
behavior. And the way that I did this was the first thing.

292
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:03,762
Listen and as it turns out listening is not actually just being silent while waiting for your turn to talk

293
00:13:03,862 --> 00:13:07,124
Which I thought counted for a really long time

294
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:12,569
But you know actually just really listening to what the other person has to say before casting judgment was create

295
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:16,492
It was critical for me and that was aided by the second thing

296
00:13:16,552 --> 00:13:19,214
Which was that I had to really remember that

297
00:13:19,394 --> 00:13:24,878
everybody we're part of a team and everybody is here making a great game because they're passionate and talented and if

298
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:28,590
you're the only person in the room disagreeing with something.

299
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:32,033
I mean, I'm not saying that you're wrong, but sometimes the problem lies within.

300
00:13:33,034 --> 00:13:38,238
So for me, I just found being obstinate in a meeting or trying to shut these things down

301
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:43,202
so aggressively, it usually, surprise, doesn't convince people. You can't just shout at them

302
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:47,405
or argue with them until they give up. That doesn't actually sway hearts and minds. That

303
00:13:47,445 --> 00:13:52,590
just makes everybody think you're a jerk. So yeah, I learned some things along the way.

304
00:13:52,977 --> 00:13:54,558
And it's funny, like I was saying before,

305
00:13:54,698 --> 00:13:56,199
these professional issues were definitely

306
00:13:56,219 --> 00:13:57,400
things that we were also carrying

307
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,380
into our personal lives.

308
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,621
And being in a personal relationship

309
00:14:00,661 --> 00:14:02,462
when we were first tasked with working together,

310
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,423
it forced us to deal with a lot of those issues

311
00:14:04,763 --> 00:14:05,624
kind of head on.

312
00:14:06,784 --> 00:14:09,286
You know, ordinarily, I would have just gone home

313
00:14:09,506 --> 00:14:11,487
and complained to Eric about my annoying writer.

314
00:14:11,987 --> 00:14:13,588
But suddenly, I was the annoying writer.

315
00:14:14,068 --> 00:14:17,870
So we had to talk it out a lot at our apartment, usually.

316
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,231
Half hour.

317
00:14:19,371 --> 00:14:20,492
Not the most fun thing.

318
00:14:23,138 --> 00:14:25,779
But in our experience, these two bad habits,

319
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,841
overcommunication and undercommunication,

320
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:30,483
those are among the most common.

321
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:33,205
I find like this kind of thing is where most

322
00:14:33,245 --> 00:14:35,006
of these issues find their roots.

323
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:38,508
And it's so important to just kind of notice them

324
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:39,469
as they're cropping up.

325
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:41,510
Yeah, because if those are causing problems for you

326
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,172
in pre-production, it's only going to get worse

327
00:14:43,232 --> 00:14:44,573
as you start making the script together.

328
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:46,974
And at Telltale, that's a hugely co-operative process

329
00:14:47,014 --> 00:14:48,235
between writing and design.

330
00:14:48,735 --> 00:14:51,097
So let's talk a little bit about how we make a script.

331
00:14:52,066 --> 00:14:57,248
It involves something that internally we like to call stubbing, which is Telltale's term

332
00:14:57,268 --> 00:14:59,348
for design's contribution to the script.

333
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:04,930
And it's where design maps out the choices and the nodes and the branches of a scene

334
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:05,791
in our software.

335
00:15:06,371 --> 00:15:10,752
And one of the things that I find makes Telltale kind of unique is narrative designers are

336
00:15:10,832 --> 00:15:14,613
actually the first ones to crack open the scene files that become the script.

337
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:20,800
And by leading this phase, design is able to ensure that those scenes don't get too passive,

338
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,640
that they're player-driven as much as possible.

339
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,340
But that doesn't mean we go wild.

340
00:15:26,621 --> 00:15:30,141
And like, if you remember that pre-production phase, really what my job is,

341
00:15:30,321 --> 00:15:34,142
is to remember the things that we talked about during our whiteboard time and transcribe those

342
00:15:34,242 --> 00:15:36,023
into the script to jog Eric's memory.

343
00:15:36,043 --> 00:15:40,783
Yeah. And so writing has been able to come in and use that framework to go on and write off dialogue.

344
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:42,875
And there are some writers who I talk to who worry, like, oh,

345
00:15:42,895 --> 00:15:44,716
does it feel like someone else is doing your job for you?

346
00:15:44,756 --> 00:15:46,097
Does it feel like you don't have enough say?

347
00:15:46,417 --> 00:15:48,058
But honestly, like Molly said, it's really rooted

348
00:15:48,098 --> 00:15:50,520
in that pre-production time, and it actually saves a lot of time

349
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,141
and energy for when you actually start writing,

350
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:53,401
because it means there's no blank page,

351
00:15:53,442 --> 00:15:54,742
and there's already a rough structure there.

352
00:15:55,143 --> 00:15:57,324
And in a video game, there's so much writing to do,

353
00:15:57,384 --> 00:15:59,946
so much dialogue, especially in a dialogue-driven game

354
00:15:59,966 --> 00:16:02,467
like what Telltale makes, it's nice to have any way

355
00:16:02,507 --> 00:16:03,248
to save a little time.

356
00:16:03,768 --> 00:16:06,470
And it works because, again, of that trust in the relationship

357
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,871
between writer and narrative designer.

358
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:13,132
That's true. Eric knows that I'm not going to go wild in the script and just start writing in all my own ideas.

359
00:16:13,592 --> 00:16:15,213
That's not very useful.

360
00:16:15,613 --> 00:16:17,495
So let's take a look at what this actually looks like.

361
00:16:18,115 --> 00:16:21,557
So here's what a choice in the Telltale tool looks like.

362
00:16:22,017 --> 00:16:22,337
Ooh.

363
00:16:23,678 --> 00:16:24,939
It's not the sexiest slide.

364
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:33,964
So this is from, just for context for you guys, this is from the big exciting finale of Minecraft Story Mode Season 1 Episode 5,

365
00:16:34,664 --> 00:16:36,105
which Eric and I were co-leads on.

366
00:16:37,116 --> 00:16:40,719
And the choice that we're looking at, it comes in when our hero, Jesse,

367
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:46,303
is confronting the villain of the episode. His name is Aiden. And Jesse is trying to take back

368
00:16:46,363 --> 00:16:51,006
this big MacGuffin that he's been trying to get the whole time called the Eversource.

369
00:16:51,026 --> 00:16:52,407
It's a magic chicken.

370
00:16:53,148 --> 00:17:00,953
It's a kid's game. But those blue nodes at the top, those are basically where the non-interactive

371
00:17:00,993 --> 00:17:05,957
cut scenes live in our tool. And then the yellow nodes are the choices. So let's break this open.

372
00:17:06,891 --> 00:17:11,552
and see what it looks like inside. I'm just going to give a super fast overview of what this is.

373
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:17,814
So here we've got a cut scene, the one that is preceding the choice. And what I've done in here,

374
00:17:17,854 --> 00:17:23,555
so this is my work and we have like a stamp that says who does what, so you know. What I've done

375
00:17:23,615 --> 00:17:27,757
is I've fudged in a couple of those blue director's notes kind of just to depict what's going on in

376
00:17:27,817 --> 00:17:32,798
the scene. And then the pink stubs are the stand-ins for the actual lines. So the sole

377
00:17:32,858 --> 00:17:34,838
purpose of these stub stand-in lines.

378
00:17:35,198 --> 00:17:39,039
are to jog Eric's memory and just give him the gist of the scene that we talked about

379
00:17:39,139 --> 00:17:41,340
possibly weeks before in our whiteboard time.

380
00:17:41,801 --> 00:17:44,722
And Molly and I have stubbed and written for each other a lot, so we've talked a lot about

381
00:17:44,762 --> 00:17:48,943
kind of best practices, and Molly knows a lot of the best shorthand used to get the

382
00:17:48,963 --> 00:17:49,684
best writing out of me.

383
00:17:49,924 --> 00:17:53,805
Yeah, actually we will, whenever you sit with a writer, if you're the narrative designer,

384
00:17:53,845 --> 00:17:55,926
we usually talk about how you prefer your stubs.

385
00:17:56,086 --> 00:17:58,227
So these are just the ones that work best for us.

386
00:17:59,793 --> 00:18:01,474
So running through the thing real fast,

387
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,794
so we've got Reggie who's another character in the scene.

388
00:18:03,854 --> 00:18:05,315
He's super surprised to see you

389
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:07,416
because spoilers, he thought you were dead.

390
00:18:08,556 --> 00:18:11,137
Aiden was talking to Reggie and doesn't like being ignored.

391
00:18:11,517 --> 00:18:13,237
So he spawns a creeper near Reggie

392
00:18:13,457 --> 00:18:16,078
and the creeper explodes and Reggie is incapacitated

393
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,159
and Reggie's in some pain.

394
00:18:18,499 --> 00:18:21,540
And then Aiden turns his attention to you, the cool player,

395
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,901
and he cannot believe that you are still alive.

396
00:18:23,961 --> 00:18:25,941
How many times does he have to kill you?

397
00:18:26,848 --> 00:18:29,830
And that last stub is actually a little more specific.

398
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,030
And there's a reason for that.

399
00:18:31,251 --> 00:18:33,652
So that's what we call the feeder line.

400
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,893
And that's any line that leads into a choice space.

401
00:18:36,794 --> 00:18:38,715
And that is something that we get a little picky

402
00:18:38,775 --> 00:18:40,096
about as narrative designers.

403
00:18:40,116 --> 00:18:42,357
Writing and design do a lot of back and forth about those.

404
00:18:42,417 --> 00:18:44,038
Because it's dialogue, but at the same time,

405
00:18:44,078 --> 00:18:46,380
it's also really integral to the choices.

406
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,801
And so it's kind of a shared custody thing.

407
00:18:47,941 --> 00:18:48,121
Yeah.

408
00:18:48,141 --> 00:18:50,322
If you don't have a great feeder line setting up your choices,

409
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:51,643
then your choices aren't so good.

410
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:54,245
And choices are technically, if you remember that first slide,

411
00:18:54,405 --> 00:18:55,565
one of my pieces of pie.

412
00:18:56,206 --> 00:18:56,326
So.

413
00:18:57,586 --> 00:18:59,688
Then we have the individual choices themselves.

414
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:03,030
I'm not as particular about how these are stubbed

415
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:07,033
because the display text, i.e. the text in the yellow nodes,

416
00:19:07,133 --> 00:19:09,215
which is actually what we'll see on the face buttons

417
00:19:09,255 --> 00:19:10,196
when you're playing the game,

418
00:19:10,936 --> 00:19:12,978
that display text basically conveys most

419
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:14,079
of what I want already.

420
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,741
So I just like to put the role play rails

421
00:19:16,841 --> 00:19:17,962
in for Eric's guidance.

422
00:19:18,803 --> 00:19:21,264
So we've got the first one, you've lost Aiden,

423
00:19:21,385 --> 00:19:23,846
which I think is going to be our cool badass choice.

424
00:19:24,147 --> 00:19:26,268
Then we've got the, you thought it would be that easy.

425
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:28,160
which is probably your snarky choice.

426
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,622
And then we've got the old give me the ever source, which

427
00:19:30,682 --> 00:19:33,144
is our straight to the point kind of cut the crap choice.

428
00:19:33,164 --> 00:19:33,725
Yeah.

429
00:19:33,925 --> 00:19:35,086
And so again, like we were talking about,

430
00:19:35,106 --> 00:19:36,508
designer writer pairs approach stubbing

431
00:19:36,528 --> 00:19:37,569
and writing lots of different ways.

432
00:19:37,749 --> 00:19:39,410
And it's important to discuss and figure out

433
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,571
what works best for your team.

434
00:19:41,352 --> 00:19:43,754
So after all that, I'm able to come in and write lines

435
00:19:43,854 --> 00:19:46,297
using those stubs as the basis for this cut scene.

436
00:19:47,178 --> 00:19:48,239
Dramatic reading, please.

437
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:49,320
So.

438
00:19:50,747 --> 00:19:53,329
Aiden's eyes widen, looking over Reggie's shoulder, and Reggie turns.

439
00:19:53,629 --> 00:19:58,171
Oh my good gosh, you're alive! You're alive! And, you know, that must mean, is the Founder alive,

440
00:19:58,211 --> 00:20:02,693
too? Is she with you? Hey, I'm not done talking to you. Aiden spawns a creeper near Reggie. What

441
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:07,316
the? The creeper explodes, incapacitating him. Jesse, our hero, comes running in. Reggie!

442
00:20:08,116 --> 00:20:12,298
Not one more step. Jesse halts as Aiden stands, getting angry. I killed you once. I can do it

443
00:20:12,318 --> 00:20:17,421
again. You were a fool to come back here, Jesse. And scene. Yeah. So...

444
00:20:18,062 --> 00:20:19,243
I think it's feeling pretty good.

445
00:20:19,404 --> 00:20:22,368
It's pretty early in the morning for that level of excitement.

446
00:20:22,428 --> 00:20:24,010
I've amped up the drama in a few spots.

447
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,152
I've added some character beats.

448
00:20:25,172 --> 00:20:27,175
You can see the note that I left there for Molly calling out

449
00:20:27,195 --> 00:20:28,436
we're at a new dialogue.

450
00:20:28,617 --> 00:20:30,620
And the only problem with it is it's starting

451
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,781
to feel a little bit long.

452
00:20:32,082 --> 00:20:32,362
Yeah.

453
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:36,792
Eric's idea for this new line, I really liked it.

454
00:20:36,972 --> 00:20:39,295
He actually caught something that I completely spaced on

455
00:20:39,355 --> 00:20:43,120
in our whiteboard time, which was that you supposedly

456
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,381
died with another person.

457
00:20:45,102 --> 00:20:46,644
So that's really good, but when you

458
00:20:46,664 --> 00:20:47,965
start to read all of it out loud,

459
00:20:48,186 --> 00:20:50,849
it's actually getting a bit long with no player interaction

460
00:20:50,889 --> 00:20:51,509
whatsoever.

461
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,071
So I'd recommend a trim.

462
00:20:53,807 --> 00:20:53,907
Yeah.

463
00:20:53,927 --> 00:20:54,507
That's possible.

464
00:20:54,647 --> 00:20:55,147
Which happens.

465
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,027
Writers love writing dialogue, as it turns out.

466
00:20:57,207 --> 00:20:57,367
Yeah.

467
00:20:58,207 --> 00:20:58,788
Which is good.

468
00:20:58,848 --> 00:21:00,508
It's good to love things.

469
00:21:01,888 --> 00:21:05,989
So part of what I do is I actually will go through.

470
00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:08,609
So basically, I do the subs, send it to Eric.

471
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:10,930
Eric makes it amazing, and then I get it back.

472
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:13,850
And one of the things that I do, and director does this too,

473
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:15,431
is we look for potential cuts.

474
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:17,431
If it starts to feel like it's getting too long,

475
00:21:18,211 --> 00:21:19,011
what can we trim down?

476
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:20,272
And I don't like to do this.

477
00:21:21,063 --> 00:21:23,745
But it's a necessary evil to kind of keep the player driving.

478
00:21:25,026 --> 00:21:29,830
So, I would also suggest that we consider cutting these two lines as well.

479
00:21:31,071 --> 00:21:33,432
Because, I mean, they're not totally necessary.

480
00:21:33,753 --> 00:21:36,254
And, you know, heaven forbid we have things that aren't totally necessary.

481
00:21:36,455 --> 00:21:37,515
Oh, God.

482
00:21:39,476 --> 00:21:42,679
Finally, I like what Eric was going for with this last line,

483
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,380
but the one before it is actually

484
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,782
going to lead into that choice space that we looked at earlier

485
00:21:46,842 --> 00:21:47,522
a lot better.

486
00:21:47,623 --> 00:21:49,404
So I would recommend that we either cut or move

487
00:21:49,424 --> 00:21:50,245
that one as well.

488
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:51,305
Sorry, sweetheart.

489
00:21:52,086 --> 00:21:52,627
I'll survive.

490
00:21:53,988 --> 00:21:56,870
And these are like the negotiations that we do.

491
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,491
No, but seriously, something like that

492
00:21:58,531 --> 00:22:00,153
really is better coming from your creative partner

493
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:02,034
rather than like an executive or someone down the road.

494
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:04,584
And I know that if it was a line I was really passionate about,

495
00:22:04,664 --> 00:22:06,424
I know we'd be able to have a discussion about it, again,

496
00:22:06,464 --> 00:22:08,745
because of all the trust and communication and all that stuff.

497
00:22:08,945 --> 00:22:10,706
We honestly do talk about it a ton.

498
00:22:10,926 --> 00:22:11,066
Yeah.

499
00:22:11,346 --> 00:22:13,166
And so now we're going to move on to these choices.

500
00:22:13,246 --> 00:22:15,007
And Molly knows I have fun writing dialogue like this,

501
00:22:15,047 --> 00:22:16,387
so her stubs are pretty open-ended.

502
00:22:16,807 --> 00:22:19,168
So for that badass choice, we've got just you and me, Aiden.

503
00:22:19,328 --> 00:22:20,049
Just you and me now.

504
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,269
For snarky, we've got give me some credit, Aiden.

505
00:22:22,469 --> 00:22:23,530
I'm a lot harder to kill than that.

506
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,630
And then to the point, we don't need to fight, Aiden.

507
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,451
All I want is a chicken.

508
00:22:27,171 --> 00:22:27,591
Hand it over.

509
00:22:29,872 --> 00:22:31,332
And so for this.

510
00:22:31,612 --> 00:22:33,752
The first one here, Eric really took the stub

511
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:36,613
and ran with it, which is good and exactly what we want,

512
00:22:37,033 --> 00:22:38,973
but it's actually getting a little far away

513
00:22:39,013 --> 00:22:41,134
from the original intent of the display text,

514
00:22:41,674 --> 00:22:43,035
which is it's over, Aiden.

515
00:22:43,715 --> 00:22:45,135
Or no, it's you've lost, Aiden.

516
00:22:45,415 --> 00:22:47,496
Whatever, something like that.

517
00:22:48,316 --> 00:22:50,136
But honestly, this is a great example

518
00:22:50,176 --> 00:22:51,557
where I like that line so much,

519
00:22:51,817 --> 00:22:54,338
I'm just going to quietly change my display text

520
00:22:54,358 --> 00:22:57,758
to match it, rather than ask Eric to adjust his line.

521
00:22:58,459 --> 00:22:58,639
See?

522
00:22:58,659 --> 00:23:00,239
It's a process.

523
00:23:01,009 --> 00:23:03,791
Yeah, so we're joking around but what design is doing here is actually really important

524
00:23:03,911 --> 00:23:08,894
And it's a great example of the different lenses that we were talking about before really enhancing the process as we go back and forth

525
00:23:08,914 --> 00:23:11,055
You know, I'm focusing on the characters in the scene

526
00:23:11,095 --> 00:23:14,457
Molly's focusing on the players experience through it and the combination of those efforts, you know

527
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:19,399
It's just gonna make for a stronger game in the end. So let's show you how the scene ended up in the ship game

528
00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:22,321
God

529
00:23:23,181 --> 00:23:26,223
I'm gonna click it

530
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:28,791
You're alive!

531
00:23:28,811 --> 00:23:29,331
Oh!

532
00:23:29,752 --> 00:23:30,612
Is the founder with you?

533
00:23:31,113 --> 00:23:36,557
What the...

534
00:23:38,198 --> 00:23:38,839
Reggie!

535
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,541
Not one more step!

536
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:47,105
I killed you once, I could do it again!

537
00:23:49,767 --> 00:23:51,108
Just you and me, Aiden.

538
00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:53,170
Just you and me now.

539
00:23:54,686 --> 00:23:56,106
I really love that scene actually.

540
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:58,727
And they have a lot more energy than I do right now.

541
00:23:58,947 --> 00:24:00,908
I think every scene should have a chicken in it.

542
00:24:01,048 --> 00:24:03,669
It really solves a lot of problems.

543
00:24:03,749 --> 00:24:07,470
But that scene I think really did come together as a great example of that writing design,

544
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,451
you know, being in balance and going back and forth with each other.

545
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:19,801
Yeah, and so we're starting to get toward the end of things now, and we thought it would be really useful to share what happens when writing and design might be a little less balanced in your game.

546
00:24:19,821 --> 00:24:25,242
Because we're talking about a lot of the ideal versions of things, but functionally that's not always the case.

547
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:32,884
And what I mean by this is, how do I identify when perhaps one discipline might be overpowering the other, and why that can be bad?

548
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:38,445
Yeah, so first up, I've got some signs that your game might be suffering from something I'm calling writing domination.

549
00:24:39,507 --> 00:24:40,388
It's a little dramatic.

550
00:24:40,828 --> 00:24:41,428
I think it's cool.

551
00:24:42,889 --> 00:24:45,651
So that includes, you've got cut scenes

552
00:24:46,091 --> 00:24:48,213
where the player character's feeling all sorts of emotions

553
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:49,754
that the player themselves might not be feeling.

554
00:24:49,794 --> 00:24:50,974
This is your classic example of you

555
00:24:50,994 --> 00:24:52,255
got a character on screen who's being

556
00:24:52,415 --> 00:24:54,036
super upset or angry about something

557
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:54,857
while you're laughing.

558
00:24:56,178 --> 00:24:59,100
And then you've got a diverse range of dialogue choices

559
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,701
that are only really saying one thing.

560
00:25:00,861 --> 00:25:02,181
And this is commonly a problem that

561
00:25:02,222 --> 00:25:03,903
happens where a writer's written a line or a moment

562
00:25:03,923 --> 00:25:05,183
that they really, really love.

563
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:06,184
And they're like, well, let's just

564
00:25:06,224 --> 00:25:08,085
make sure all the choices lead right into that.

565
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:11,575
I'm angry, I'm really angry, or I'm so mad.

566
00:25:12,055 --> 00:25:13,996
Right, and so that's the sort of thing that design will come in and be like,

567
00:25:14,036 --> 00:25:16,537
no, no, no, we need to actually practice that a little bit more.

568
00:25:17,218 --> 00:25:19,779
And then this last one's a pretty common one,

569
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:24,082
but it's the player only reacting to what other more interesting characters in the scene are doing.

570
00:25:24,282 --> 00:25:27,404
This is a great example if you might have a big ensemble cast,

571
00:25:27,424 --> 00:25:29,865
and so you've got all these wacky NPCs in the group with you,

572
00:25:29,905 --> 00:25:32,426
and they have their interesting backstories and their cool character growth,

573
00:25:33,027 --> 00:25:35,668
where you're just kind of being told and watching their story

574
00:25:35,688 --> 00:25:37,169
instead of one that you're driving and playing.

575
00:25:37,344 --> 00:25:41,488
I find a red flag on this one is if you have the choice,

576
00:25:42,148 --> 00:25:44,250
calm down, that's usually a tip off

577
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,352
that two other people are doing something

578
00:25:46,392 --> 00:25:47,813
really interesting that you're watching.

579
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:49,955
And so those are the kind of traps

580
00:25:49,995 --> 00:25:51,396
that we have to avoid falling into.

581
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:52,457
Please just calm down.

582
00:25:53,498 --> 00:25:55,379
On the flip side, you've got signs

583
00:25:55,459 --> 00:25:57,861
that design might be throwing a little too much weight around.

584
00:25:58,061 --> 00:25:59,723
And those include things like.

585
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:05,384
You get those super to the point lines that tell you exactly where to go and what to do

586
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:09,207
because clarity is king. Go to the place, get the thing, bring it back.

587
00:26:09,687 --> 00:26:13,269
Like, it's just like not as fun to listen to.

588
00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:14,930
That's very clear.

589
00:26:16,011 --> 00:26:21,214
Mechanics for the sake of mechanics, because what better to amp up the emotional stakes in your scene

590
00:26:21,234 --> 00:26:24,556
than a sick round of shuffle puck or some mini-game?

591
00:26:25,731 --> 00:26:29,435
And then finally the old, no one can be interesting except the player, ever.

592
00:26:29,615 --> 00:26:33,619
And this is actually kind of the inverse of Eric's last point, but it's one of the things

593
00:26:33,639 --> 00:26:39,364
that I find design does a lot, where it's like, I like to call it dumb NPC syndrome,

594
00:26:39,484 --> 00:26:44,069
because you'll have a bunch of NPCs standing around an unlocked door waiting for you to

595
00:26:44,209 --> 00:26:46,011
open it, things like that.

596
00:26:47,938 --> 00:26:49,759
And so we're obviously describing exaggerated worst

597
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:51,540
case scenarios to be funny here, but hopefully it's

598
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,060
getting to the root of what we've been talking about.

599
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,641
And if you take away anything from this talk,

600
00:26:54,721 --> 00:26:56,602
we hope it's what's on this slide.

601
00:26:57,142 --> 00:26:59,263
So first that's having those lenses through which you

602
00:26:59,283 --> 00:27:00,843
evaluate your game are really important.

603
00:27:01,103 --> 00:27:03,804
Because if writing is responsible for your characters,

604
00:27:03,844 --> 00:27:05,345
design's responsible for your player,

605
00:27:05,405 --> 00:27:07,245
then it means that they can both share responsibility

606
00:27:07,265 --> 00:27:09,606
for the story, and that means that no one

607
00:27:09,626 --> 00:27:10,767
has a monopoly over the two.

608
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:12,747
Which is good, because making a game is a team effort.

609
00:27:13,668 --> 00:27:15,548
And then there's also the fact that.

610
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:20,318
I find if the writer and designer, if they're not supporting each other in the room, then

611
00:27:20,358 --> 00:27:23,420
why would you expect the writing and design to support each other in your game?

612
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,963
Like it's a very fundamental thing, but it really is true.

613
00:27:26,983 --> 00:27:32,967
And one of the things that I kind of love about Telltale is Eric and I are on equal

614
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:33,347
footing.

615
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:36,589
Design doesn't actually get to tell writing what to do.

616
00:27:36,649 --> 00:27:38,190
We do need to agree on things.

617
00:27:38,567 --> 00:27:44,088
which really makes it so that we are kind of forced to see things eye to eye in a, what

618
00:27:44,128 --> 00:27:45,389
I find is a very productive way.

619
00:27:45,409 --> 00:27:48,530
It means our stories are really the most important thing, which I love.

620
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,231
And we learned all of this the hard way.

621
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:56,893
Working professionally with your significant other is not easy all the time and it really

622
00:27:56,953 --> 00:27:59,033
forced us to have some tough conversations.

623
00:27:59,293 --> 00:28:00,294
I hate tough conversations.

624
00:28:02,397 --> 00:28:06,739
Yeah, and honestly, one of the reasons that we really wanted to have this talk in the

625
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:11,421
first place is to allow people to kind of not end up in the position that we found ourselves

626
00:28:11,501 --> 00:28:15,042
in where you'd have these tensions at work, but you can never escape them because you

627
00:28:15,082 --> 00:28:15,943
live with that person.

628
00:28:16,243 --> 00:28:17,963
But it actually forced us to do a lot of work.

629
00:28:18,244 --> 00:28:22,545
Right, and you might not be dating your creative partner, but you are in a relationship with

630
00:28:22,585 --> 00:28:23,566
them whether you like it or not.

631
00:28:23,986 --> 00:28:26,987
And honesty and trust are just as important in a professional relationship as they are

632
00:28:27,007 --> 00:28:28,007
in a personal relationship.

633
00:28:28,227 --> 00:28:29,548
So, you know, be nice to each other.

634
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:30,608
Be nice to each other.

635
00:28:31,849 --> 00:28:37,351
So really quick, I do want to thank GDC for letting us have this talk, Telltale as well,

636
00:28:37,491 --> 00:28:41,272
and mostly for you guys for coming at 11 o'clock in the morning on Wednesday.

637
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:42,633
So thank you for being here.

638
00:28:42,673 --> 00:28:43,633
We really appreciate that.

639
00:28:43,733 --> 00:28:48,455
And please, you should be getting some surveys in your email inboxes if you could let us

640
00:28:48,495 --> 00:28:48,995
know how we did.

641
00:28:49,836 --> 00:28:50,436
We'd love to hear it.

642
00:28:50,616 --> 00:28:54,598
And we're going to be over in this wrap-up area for a little bit.

643
00:28:54,618 --> 00:28:54,978
For questions.

644
00:28:55,158 --> 00:28:57,839
So we're going to leave and be in the wrap-up area.

645
00:28:57,939 --> 00:28:58,939
So thank you so much.

646
00:28:58,959 --> 00:28:59,540
Thank you, everybody.
