1
00:00:05,862 --> 00:00:10,644
everyone to the, uh, first talk of board game design day.

2
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:16,427
Woo! Yep. Um, thank you for joining me at the, uh, crack of

3
00:00:16,427 --> 00:00:20,689
10am, uh, to talk about Mansions of Madness. Uh, my name is

4
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:24,271
Andrew Fisher, uh, I'm the board and card game manager at Fantasy

5
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:27,933
Flight Games. Um, for those of you who aren't aware of us,

6
00:00:27,933 --> 00:00:31,275
Fantasy Flight Games is a hobby market board game company. Uh,

7
00:00:31,275 --> 00:00:33,896
we operate out of Minnesota here in the states.

8
00:00:34,156 --> 00:00:38,820
Um, so I've been a designer for Fantasy Flight for about, uh, 7 years or so.

9
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,585
I've worked on the Star Wars role playing game, uh, I've worked on the Rune Wars miniatures

10
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,687
game, the Fallout board game, among many others.

11
00:00:45,687 --> 00:00:50,191
Um, I was also the scenario designer on Mansions of Madness, which is what I'll be talking

12
00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:50,631
about today.

13
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,531
Um, I also quick before I started the talk, just wanted to thank um, a few of my other

14
00:00:55,531 --> 00:00:59,673
team members who helped contribute to this talk. Uh, the lead designer of the game, Nikki

15
00:00:59,673 --> 00:01:06,135
Valens couldn't be here. Um, and also uh, a couple of our uh, scenario designers and ongoing

16
00:01:06,135 --> 00:01:08,876
developers on the game, uh, Carl, Cara Sintel-Dunk and uh, uh, and uh, uh, uh, uh, and uh,

17
00:01:09,356 --> 00:01:13,917
Grace Holdinghouse, as well as our primary programmer. We had a few different programmers

18
00:01:13,917 --> 00:01:18,358
working on the game, but our primary programmer, Mark Jones, helped put together this talk, and

19
00:01:18,358 --> 00:01:23,999
he's in the audience today. So I just wanted to thank them, because they were a huge help in

20
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:31,020
putting this all together. So to start us off... That's a good sign. There we go. All right.

21
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,081
Mansions of Madness, second edition.

22
00:01:33,985 --> 00:01:41,688
This is a board game. We released it about two years ago. We are still releasing expansions and DLC for it today.

23
00:01:41,688 --> 00:01:50,372
But I'll just be kind of talking about the core game development today and kind of the challenges at creating this kind of unique form of game that I'll talk about.

24
00:01:50,372 --> 00:01:57,095
So quick, before we get started, I kind of wanted to do the standard GDC survey of how many people have played this game.

25
00:01:57,095 --> 00:01:57,535
But first...

26
00:01:58,675 --> 00:02:01,078
In our department we were kind of talking about, we were

27
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:04,180
curious about the attendance of board game design day. So I

28
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,403
just kind of wanted to get a sense of like, how many of you

29
00:02:07,403 --> 00:02:11,127
work on digital games? Okay, so like the vast majority of you.

30
00:02:11,127 --> 00:02:15,090
How many of you work on tabletop games? Alright, sweet.

31
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:21,036
Represent. Yeah, so and then finally I'll ask the standard

32
00:02:21,036 --> 00:02:24,038
question, how many of you have played Mansions of Madness

33
00:02:24,038 --> 00:02:24,599
second edition?

34
00:02:25,741 --> 00:02:30,363
Alright, so a good number of you. Um, well for those who haven't, um, as it kinda says

35
00:02:30,363 --> 00:02:35,486
in the title, Mansions is what we call an app integrated board game. Uh, you'll be excused

36
00:02:35,486 --> 00:02:40,349
for maybe not quite knowing what that means because we kinda made it up. Uh, so what does

37
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:45,752
that mean? Um, well, you might be first be thinking about playing Settlers of Catan or

38
00:02:45,752 --> 00:02:48,293
Ticket to Ride or something on your phone. Um,

39
00:02:49,626 --> 00:02:51,427
But those are more like digital board games.

40
00:02:51,427 --> 00:02:52,688
They're exclusive to that device.

41
00:02:52,688 --> 00:02:55,370
You also might be thinking about supplemental apps

42
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,691
for the board games you've played,

43
00:02:57,691 --> 00:03:00,853
like using an app to help out with your character

44
00:03:00,853 --> 00:03:02,435
in Betrayal at House on the Hill,

45
00:03:02,435 --> 00:03:04,416
or that cool voiceover app that comes with

46
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,137
One Night Ultimate Werewolf.

47
00:03:06,137 --> 00:03:07,458
But those are just kind of supplemental.

48
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,260
You can play these games without these apps.

49
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,081
What are app-integrated games are?

50
00:03:12,755 --> 00:03:18,997
are a game system that requires both the board game elements and the digital elements to

51
00:03:18,997 --> 00:03:24,458
function. Um, ideally these are game systems that couldn't exist in the same form without

52
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:29,300
both elements. Um, we want to try to create, craft a unique experience that you couldn't

53
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:36,002
get quite any other way. Um, so what Mansions actually looks like in play, um, is...

54
00:03:36,363 --> 00:03:41,668
You each play as a investigator in 1920s Arkham.

55
00:03:41,668 --> 00:03:47,595
Arkham is this New England city in this world where all of the writings of H.P. Lovecraft are true.

56
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:53,622
And so you are looking into the, you know, the occult and the working of the elder gods

57
00:03:53,622 --> 00:03:56,044
and kind of investigating these haunted mansions.

58
00:03:57,294 --> 00:04:01,198
um, represented by these boards here. Uh, well, I shouldn't say

59
00:04:01,198 --> 00:04:04,260
they're usually mansions. Some of our expansions, uh, go to

60
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,484
more exciting locales. But, um, usually you're exploring these

61
00:04:08,484 --> 00:04:10,606
different mansions that we lay out in different ways with these

62
00:04:10,606 --> 00:04:13,628
different modular map tiles. You move around the map, you roll

63
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,470
dice to, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

64
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,702
figure out if you succeed or fail at different challenges,

65
00:04:19,702 --> 00:04:21,283
you find items represented by cards,

66
00:04:21,283 --> 00:04:23,886
and you make important decisions

67
00:04:23,886 --> 00:04:28,750
that change the outcome of a branching narrative.

68
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,872
Each game of Mansions takes about two hours-ish to play,

69
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:32,773
depending on the scenario.

70
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:37,056
Um, and each play session of it is a self-contained experience.

71
00:04:37,056 --> 00:04:39,058
At the end you'll have a story with an ending.

72
00:04:39,058 --> 00:04:44,302
Um, this isn't really a campaign game, this is kind of, uh, each time you play is a self-contained

73
00:04:44,302 --> 00:04:44,702
experience.

74
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:53,748
Um, all of the narrative in this, uh, board game is run by, um, the app.

75
00:04:53,748 --> 00:04:58,612
Um, the app tracks, um, all of the narrative and enemies.

76
00:04:58,612 --> 00:05:01,514
Basically, uh, it's kind of like...

77
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:04,981
If you're playing a role playing game where you're these investigators, the app is your

78
00:05:04,981 --> 00:05:11,324
game master. It is taking care of all of those tasks for you. Um, usually, uh, we ship on a

79
00:05:11,324 --> 00:05:16,667
lot of different platforms. Uh, it comes on phones, tablets, you can get it on Steam, on

80
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:22,410
the computer, and a lot of players actually, uh, we've seen online, uh, will put it up to

81
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:27,013
their TV so the whole group can kind of read it. Um, the actual game flow changes based on,

82
00:05:27,013 --> 00:05:27,113
uh,

83
00:05:28,321 --> 00:05:30,802
how people are interacting with it. Some people will just have

84
00:05:30,802 --> 00:05:33,203
the phone and tablet and read it out loud to each other. Others

85
00:05:33,203 --> 00:05:35,944
will pass it around. Others will all read it together on a

86
00:05:35,944 --> 00:05:41,987
larger screen. So that's kind of the flow of the game is you're

87
00:05:41,987 --> 00:05:44,748
reading from this app, exploring these mansions on the table.

88
00:05:44,748 --> 00:05:47,289
Don't worry if you don't know the exact specifics of the game.

89
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:50,371
I'll kind of dive into and explain specifics as I use them

90
00:05:50,371 --> 00:05:54,352
as examples. So today I'll be diving into the core

91
00:05:54,352 --> 00:05:56,273
developments of this game. And then...

92
00:05:57,995 --> 00:05:59,556
I'll be diving into the core development of this game and

93
00:05:59,556 --> 00:06:02,298
then kind of going into a post-mortem kind of the

94
00:06:02,298 --> 00:06:04,820
standard structure of five things that went well for us,

95
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,242
five things that went poorly for us, um, and kind of what

96
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,624
we learned from each of those, especially about integrating

97
00:06:10,624 --> 00:06:13,826
tabletop and digital games together in the same dev cycle.

98
00:06:13,826 --> 00:06:16,428
Um, I'm not necessarily going to cover them in that order,

99
00:06:16,428 --> 00:06:18,189
I'm kind of going to cover them chronologically.

100
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:19,990
So with that, let's start at the beginning.

101
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,101
Um, so FFG has a long history of making great board games.

102
00:06:26,101 --> 00:06:28,121
We've been making board games for over 20 years.

103
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:35,223
Um, we also have a media department who handles our, um, all of the supplemental

104
00:06:35,223 --> 00:06:38,664
apps for our games, like dice rollers and such, and they've also, um, in the

105
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:42,425
last several years been making, um, some very successful standalone

106
00:06:42,425 --> 00:06:43,885
games based on our board games.

107
00:06:44,345 --> 00:06:49,507
Um, these kind of fall into that first category that I talked about. These are, um, tend to be adaptations.

108
00:06:49,507 --> 00:07:00,311
They're not quite just ports of our board games to the digital space. They tend to be, they kind of tend to add to the game and, um, um, take the, the spirit of the game and put it onto, um, a digital platform.

109
00:07:00,311 --> 00:07:10,315
Um, so we've had success in both, uh, in both realms. And then, uh, we actually have, uh, at this point, when we started Mansions of Madness, um, had already shipped,

110
00:07:10,775 --> 00:07:14,922
one app integrated game, which was the Xcom board game.

111
00:07:14,922 --> 00:07:20,310
In this game, you play as members of the Xcom organization

112
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,654
coordinating to save the world from aliens.

113
00:07:23,365 --> 00:07:29,987
The app, uh, in this kind of encompasses a single mechanic. It shows you all the threats

114
00:07:29,987 --> 00:07:33,668
coming down to the world in real time and, you know, the four of you have to sit there

115
00:07:33,668 --> 00:07:37,089
and coordinate in real time answering these threats as the app spits them out at you.

116
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:41,311
And it can adjust the difficulty kind of based on how well or poorly you're doing as you

117
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:47,133
react to this app in real time. Um, but Mansions of Madness was on a whole different scale

118
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:51,574
from this game. So this was a much larger undertaking. Uh, the reason for this is in

119
00:07:52,254 --> 00:07:55,855
Um, the split between kind of the day, the table top side of

120
00:07:55,855 --> 00:07:58,176
things and the digital side of things, um, was pretty

121
00:07:58,176 --> 00:08:01,678
unbalanced. Um, uh, in XCOM the vast majority of the game

122
00:08:01,678 --> 00:08:04,599
mechanics, I could have gone on listing them, were all in the

123
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:07,280
table top side of things. Whereas the digital side just

124
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,481
mainly handled the real time, uh, execution of the threats.

125
00:08:10,921 --> 00:08:15,950
Uh, so it was really just like a single mechanic in the game run by the digital side.

126
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:20,138
Um, obviously, you know, this project had its own travails, but it was on a much smaller

127
00:08:20,138 --> 00:08:23,464
scale than Mansions was going to be and what we wanted to see from Mansions.

128
00:08:24,132 --> 00:08:28,773
Um, so Mansions was a daunting task, but, uh, we got started right.

129
00:08:28,773 --> 00:08:31,794
And that brings me to our, the first thing that went pretty well with our development,

130
00:08:31,794 --> 00:08:34,735
which was that, uh, we prototyped early.

131
00:08:34,735 --> 00:08:42,917
Uh, Nikki Valens and I, um, worked pretty early on the game and dove in pretty thoroughly

132
00:08:42,917 --> 00:08:47,918
on our various prototypes to kind of see what apps were capable of, uh, in the realm of

133
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:51,479
board games and what players would, well, put up with.

134
00:08:53,743 --> 00:08:58,926
Luckily we weren't starting from scratch. Uh, as, as you can see from the title of the

135
00:08:58,926 --> 00:09:03,267
game, second edition, um, we are based on a first edition of the game. Uh, it's pretty

136
00:09:03,267 --> 00:09:08,890
similar to the premise I already talked about, um, but instead of being a co-op game where

137
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:12,591
you're playing as investigators investigating this mystery, uh, it was what we call our

138
00:09:12,591 --> 00:09:17,033
one ver- uh, one versus many game. So one player was kind of playing as the, all the

139
00:09:17,033 --> 00:09:23,256
bad guys basically being your GM. Uh, this worked fine, but, um, it wasn't, you know,

140
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:29,057
as... it didn't quite fit the game experience we wanted out of Mansions of Madness. Mansions

141
00:09:29,057 --> 00:09:34,082
was all about this kind of spooky storytelling atmosphere and when, you know, Mike is sitting

142
00:09:34,082 --> 00:09:38,547
across the table from you, you know, playing all his cultists, it's just not quite as scary

143
00:09:38,547 --> 00:09:42,311
as if, you know, it's this mystery coming out of the unknown.

144
00:09:42,925 --> 00:09:47,368
Uh, so the one versus many wasn't quite working for the aesthetic we wanted to get across

145
00:09:47,368 --> 00:09:47,928
for Mansions.

146
00:09:47,928 --> 00:09:53,310
Um, additionally, first edition had an incredibly complex setup as you seeded, uh, you set up

147
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:57,092
the whole board ahead of time, you seeded out all the different, the narrative onto

148
00:09:57,092 --> 00:10:01,294
the board and one little screw up could completely screw up your story for the whole two hour

149
00:10:01,294 --> 00:10:02,375
play session.

150
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,836
Um, also it lacked a lot of discovery, uh, you know.

151
00:10:05,827 --> 00:10:08,849
you can not read the cards ahead of time but in the end you're

152
00:10:08,849 --> 00:10:11,851
getting all the content in the box. Um you can see everything

153
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:13,873
you're going to encounter in this mission. You set it up

154
00:10:13,873 --> 00:10:16,475
beforehand. So it just didn't have that sense of discovery

155
00:10:16,475 --> 00:10:19,517
that we wanted out of uh this game where you're, we wanted

156
00:10:19,517 --> 00:10:21,558
this game where you open a door and you have no idea what's

157
00:10:21,558 --> 00:10:24,841
going to be on the other side. But um it gave us a good

158
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:28,283
launching, a start, launching point for our prototyping. Um

159
00:10:28,283 --> 00:10:31,925
we started by replicating first edition but adding an app kind

160
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:33,867
of in place of that one player. Um.

161
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:39,610
So at our very first step, we started by simulating the app.

162
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:43,591
We created these flowcharts, these state machines,

163
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:44,411
of the app's logic.

164
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:47,652
And we created massive, complex ones

165
00:10:47,652 --> 00:10:50,293
to play out an entire two-hour scenario with players.

166
00:10:50,293 --> 00:10:53,614
And then we would have the designer kind of pretend

167
00:10:53,614 --> 00:10:55,194
to be the app in a playtest.

168
00:10:55,194 --> 00:10:57,315
In fact, we went so far as to separate them

169
00:10:57,315 --> 00:10:58,935
from the test to some degree.

170
00:10:58,935 --> 00:11:01,476
Usually, one of us would sit with our back to, uh...

171
00:11:02,116 --> 00:11:06,758
to the testers and just read off our flow charts and that way to disconnect ourselves

172
00:11:06,758 --> 00:11:11,061
from the information on the table top and really get in the head space of like what

173
00:11:11,061 --> 00:11:14,622
does this app know and what doesn't it know and how is the interface with the app and

174
00:11:14,622 --> 00:11:20,926
the players. Um but in the end our app wasn't going to be speaking to them so the next step

175
00:11:20,926 --> 00:11:25,948
of testing after we kind of iterated on this approach was to move to a grey box app.

176
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:31,898
Um luckily both Nikki and I have some coding experience and so we were able to uh write

177
00:11:31,898 --> 00:11:36,306
some rudimentary scripts that kind of mimic the functionality we wanted to see in the

178
00:11:36,306 --> 00:11:37,067
app um.

179
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,860
So we created this gray box that could play through an entire

180
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,282
scenario of mansions.

181
00:11:45,282 --> 00:11:47,304
Primarily Nicky created it.

182
00:11:47,304 --> 00:11:50,406
So we could code, but I don't actually think there's anything

183
00:11:50,406 --> 00:11:52,587
horrible in this little screenshot I showed.

184
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,929
But you don't want to look too closely at our gray box.

185
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:55,629
It's pretty gross.

186
00:11:55,629 --> 00:11:58,552
There's like go-to's and other things that I'm pretty sure

187
00:11:58,552 --> 00:11:59,752
would make Mark over there cringe.

188
00:12:01,094 --> 00:12:06,401
It was a bit of a nightmare, but it was functional and it gave us the testing we needed.

189
00:12:06,401 --> 00:12:11,888
It allowed us to identify very early on before real development started what the strengths

190
00:12:11,888 --> 00:12:16,133
and weaknesses of the tabletop elements and the digital elements were and kind of identify

191
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:18,396
those to help us while we were designing.

192
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:25,070
So we identified several key strengths and weaknesses here. I've just kind of showed, um,

193
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:31,194
some of the, the very broad strengths we identified. Um, I'll dive into them a little

194
00:12:31,194 --> 00:12:35,337
deeper and some of the things that went well and poorly in development. But in general,

195
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:40,081
tabletop games, um, are really good at flexible effects and timings, at interrupting at any

196
00:12:40,081 --> 00:12:44,484
point, at doing kind of weird incomparable effects. They also have a great tactical

197
00:12:44,484 --> 00:12:45,705
interface for interacting.

198
00:12:46,085 --> 00:12:50,908
um, for people to collaborate on a game very, very quickly and intuitively. Um, they also

199
00:12:50,908 --> 00:12:55,150
have that social dynamic and we can actually do a lot of design around social interactions

200
00:12:55,150 --> 00:13:00,892
at the table that you just can't quite mimic, um, in the digital space, I guess, yet. VR

201
00:13:00,892 --> 00:13:05,414
is, you know, uh, doing some exciting stuff there, but, um, and then on the digital side

202
00:13:05,414 --> 00:13:09,616
of things, um, the di- digital games tend to be much better at real time interactions.

203
00:13:09,616 --> 00:13:14,398
They can handle that constant coming and going, whereas, like, when you're on the tabletop,

204
00:13:14,398 --> 00:13:15,138
everybody's like, wait.

205
00:13:15,535 --> 00:13:20,700
stop, uh, what does this card do? What does this wording mean? And all of that. Um, also

206
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:26,285
digital games excel at hidden information. Something that, uh, board games can often

207
00:13:26,285 --> 00:13:30,389
struggle with. Um, and then lastly, digital games can handle a massive amount more

208
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:32,751
complexity than our tabletop games can.

209
00:13:34,107 --> 00:13:38,250
So, after learning all these lessons and doing all this prototyping, we were ready to dive

210
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,192
into development proper. And this is when our tabletop team started working with the

211
00:13:42,192 --> 00:13:50,158
media team. And naturally, these two teams worked perfectly together and the production

212
00:13:50,158 --> 00:13:57,562
went off without a hitch. So, that's a lie. It was a bit of a mess. And that brings me

213
00:13:57,562 --> 00:14:00,144
to the first thing that went wrong, and several other things that went wrong.

214
00:14:02,398 --> 00:14:06,523
Tabletop designers and digital designers working together

215
00:14:06,523 --> 00:14:09,787
was probably one of the biggest challenges of this product,

216
00:14:09,787 --> 00:14:12,690
and we hit it right off the bat.

217
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,513
Some of you may recognize these icons.

218
00:14:14,513 --> 00:14:18,257
The left there is waterfall management technique,

219
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:19,559
where everything's kind of in a line,

220
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,420
and the other one's agile.

221
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:27,245
Um, so, our tabletop, the tabletop side of things, by the necessities of, uh, printing,

222
00:14:27,245 --> 00:14:30,428
require a certain amount of just linear scheduling.

223
00:14:30,428 --> 00:14:34,311
Things need to be done by certain points to start being printed or produced or tooled

224
00:14:34,311 --> 00:14:35,432
or whatever else.

225
00:14:35,432 --> 00:14:37,874
Um, whereas our software team can be a lot more agile.

226
00:14:37,874 --> 00:14:43,098
Um, and so we take, uh, two very different approaches and these immediately started colliding.

227
00:14:43,098 --> 00:14:47,822
Um, uh, these teams had never really worked together before and these workflows really,

228
00:14:47,822 --> 00:14:48,643
really clashed.

229
00:14:48,643 --> 00:14:49,043
Um, yeah.

230
00:14:49,043 --> 00:14:49,083
Um,

231
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,324
Transcribed by https://otter.ai

232
00:14:51,102 --> 00:14:58,851
compounding this, this probably isn't super accurate. Uh, waterfall makes tabletop look way

233
00:14:58,851 --> 00:15:01,615
too organized. This is probably more accurate. Um...

234
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:07,815
Well, uh, our tabletop teams are small and one of the strengths of them is how small

235
00:15:07,815 --> 00:15:10,996
they are. That they can just turn around and chat with each other. They can innovate. You

236
00:15:10,996 --> 00:15:14,518
know, you can just grab a card, change the text right away. It's that kind of mentality

237
00:15:14,518 --> 00:15:19,420
that kind of leads and, and we allow our tabletop designers quite a bit of freedom so that they

238
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:23,982
can kind of innovate and, you know, make the changes to the game that the game needs. Uh,

239
00:15:23,982 --> 00:15:30,185
this chaos isn't suited super well to them collaborating with our programmers. Um, and

240
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:36,735
a pretty big conflict for us. Additionally, this was one of the larger teams our company

241
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:42,540
had ever worked with. We tend to keep fairly small teams for our tabletop development.

242
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,964
And so we were scaling to a team size, working across departments. I know these are challenges

243
00:15:46,964 --> 00:15:51,869
that a lot of you are probably pretty used to, but were pretty new to us. And so we struggled

244
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:52,570
with communication.

245
00:15:54,992 --> 00:15:57,253
you know, just turning around and chatting in each other's

246
00:15:57,253 --> 00:16:00,254
cubes wasn't really a good strategy anymore. We didn't have

247
00:16:00,254 --> 00:16:02,995
like a centralized communication, uh, thing like, uh,

248
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:06,177
Slack or anything yet. Um, we didn't have centralized

249
00:16:06,177 --> 00:16:08,698
documentation, we didn't have a middle man between the teams.

250
00:16:08,698 --> 00:16:12,140
And so because of this, we were kind of relying on just word of

251
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:16,762
mouth and obviously this kind of hit a brick wall for us. Uh, we

252
00:16:16,762 --> 00:16:21,184
eventually got over it, um, kind of early in development to, um,

253
00:16:22,505 --> 00:16:28,211
uh... and improved but uh... one of the biggest steps we took was actually came from the

254
00:16:28,211 --> 00:16:33,136
media team which was uh... the implementation of our tools uh...

255
00:16:33,136 --> 00:16:41,344
originally you know it we were working with this gray box and it was a bit of a mess

256
00:16:41,344 --> 00:16:42,966
and so uh...

257
00:16:42,966 --> 00:16:43,407
yes

258
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:49,125
So the, a big breakthrough came for us at the discovery of

259
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:52,767
Playmaker. Playmaker, so we were using Unity. Um, we decided to

260
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:54,967
use Unity pretty early on. I think we used it for XCOM, is

261
00:16:54,967 --> 00:16:59,368
that right, Mark? Yeah. Um, so, uh, we were using Unity and, but

262
00:16:59,368 --> 00:17:04,290
the problem we were running into is our tabletop developers, uh,

263
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:08,251
us, we weren't great at coding. Um, and then we also wanted to

264
00:17:08,251 --> 00:17:11,072
put developers on this pro, project who had never coded

265
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:11,652
before at all.

266
00:17:12,272 --> 00:17:15,176
So this is going to be a big challenge for us and a big

267
00:17:15,176 --> 00:17:18,942
challenge for communication and training and everything else.

268
00:17:18,942 --> 00:17:22,427
But PlayMaker was something that we discovered.

269
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:27,992
Oh that's right, yep. So we have our gray box. Um, it, as I

270
00:17:27,992 --> 00:17:30,693
mentioned earlier, it was a mess. It wasn't very scalable.

271
00:17:30,693 --> 00:17:33,535
It wasn't really easy for non-programmers to, to learn

272
00:17:33,535 --> 00:17:37,477
and it was just a mess to debug. Um, this line by line of go to's

273
00:17:37,477 --> 00:17:41,979
just broke constantly and was a mess. So Playmaker is a plugin

274
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:46,621
for Unity that allows for visual scripting. Um, eh, allows for

275
00:17:46,621 --> 00:17:49,102
creat-, the creation of state machines to, uh,

276
00:17:50,223 --> 00:17:55,630
tracked a lot the flow of the game and it allowed for us, well it allowed for our media team to

277
00:17:55,630 --> 00:18:00,836
create a encapsulated environment for our tabletop developers to work in so that they didn't have to

278
00:18:00,836 --> 00:18:06,163
learn all the nitty gritty of Unity and could just focus on designing scenarios and focus on

279
00:18:06,163 --> 00:18:07,765
the mechanics of the game.

280
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,921
uh playmaker was also pretty useful for us because it was

281
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:15,143
very modular um whereas with some of our other projects we

282
00:18:15,143 --> 00:18:17,904
create very like specific infrastructures unit uh

283
00:18:17,904 --> 00:18:21,946
playmaker allowed us to um build on it and actually we used it

284
00:18:21,946 --> 00:18:24,927
for our next two app integrated games that came after mansions

285
00:18:24,927 --> 00:18:28,269
of madness uh this is the road to legend app for our descent

286
00:18:28,269 --> 00:18:30,990
board game and then the legends the alliance app for our

287
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,991
imperial assault board game both of these used that playmaker

288
00:18:33,991 --> 00:18:38,133
back end that we originally developed for uh mansions

289
00:18:39,226 --> 00:18:42,988
Um, so this ended up being great. It really helped with our communication

290
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:46,090
problems because we could train the developers to use this encapsulated

291
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:49,632
section of the game and, uh, er, of the dev development tools and work within

292
00:18:49,632 --> 00:18:53,774
that, um, and allowed us as developers to focus on mechanics, which is where we

293
00:18:53,774 --> 00:18:55,095
hit our next roadblock. Um...

294
00:18:58,591 --> 00:19:04,955
So, those of you who know FFG know that we like to support our games.

295
00:19:04,955 --> 00:19:07,617
We create a lot of content.

296
00:19:07,617 --> 00:19:14,522
This is Arkham Horror 2nd edition, which I believe all the expansions, it's kind of spilling

297
00:19:14,522 --> 00:19:15,402
off the photo there.

298
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:20,785
We release a lot of expansions for our games. We're constantly supporting and updating and

299
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:26,107
creating new and interesting ways to play these games. We need to create just a ton of content

300
00:19:26,107 --> 00:19:30,550
and it needs to be novel and interesting for these tabletop players. It needs to play to those

301
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:36,492
tabletop strengths we talked about. And it needs to be compelling in person as you kind of play

302
00:19:36,492 --> 00:19:38,633
the game with each other.

303
00:19:39,209 --> 00:19:42,891
Additionally, as we're working on all these expansions, we're kind of looking ahead and

304
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:47,453
our media departments, our programmers, are going to be working on other projects.

305
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:52,515
They can't afford to constantly be supporting and expanding all the different app integrated

306
00:19:52,515 --> 00:19:55,196
game lines we work on right now.

307
00:19:55,196 --> 00:19:59,638
We need for the majority of the work for this to be done by tabletop developers.

308
00:19:59,638 --> 00:20:02,720
Now this is a challenge with these kind of...

309
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:09,446
The mechanics that tabletop developers rely on to create interesting tabletop experiences

310
00:20:09,446 --> 00:20:12,710
tend to have a couple of problems that clash with digital.

311
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:16,995
So as an example, let me show you just the test for Mansions of Madness.

312
00:20:16,995 --> 00:20:21,541
Now a test is a moment that something challenges you in the game and you have to see if you

313
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,162
succeed or fail.

314
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:27,903
It's a pretty simple thing. All you really do is you roll some dice, you count up how many of a

315
00:20:27,903 --> 00:20:32,304
certain type of symbol there are in the dice, and you get to have a chance to convert some of a

316
00:20:32,304 --> 00:20:37,466
second type of symbol to the first type to improve your result. Um, and then you count them up, and

317
00:20:37,466 --> 00:20:41,066
based on how many you get, you know whether you succeed or fail. It's a pretty straightforward

318
00:20:41,066 --> 00:20:46,468
process, but upon going through all of the content we've made for mansions thus far, and

319
00:20:46,468 --> 00:20:51,049
looking at all the different places in this relatively simple process that our content

320
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:52,509
interfaces with these rules.

321
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,171
we get this.

322
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:55,011
Um, now this is,

323
00:20:55,011 --> 00:21:01,557
this looks messy, but from a tabletop

324
00:21:01,557 --> 00:21:04,500
perspective, this is pretty straight forward. Um,

325
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,603
we have pretty solid timing rules that tell you exactly

326
00:21:07,603 --> 00:21:10,766
when different things come up, um, and it creates some very interesting

327
00:21:10,766 --> 00:21:13,488
effects and relationships that we couldn't otherwise

328
00:21:13,488 --> 00:21:14,589
create. Um.

329
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:20,773
Obviously this can be a challenge for digital, uh, implementation because, so for example

330
00:21:20,773 --> 00:21:26,997
if this test process is all in your app, we now need a user interrupt point at every single

331
00:21:26,997 --> 00:21:28,678
one of these places.

332
00:21:28,678 --> 00:21:33,081
The user needs to be able to specify if some content that we've created is interacting

333
00:21:33,081 --> 00:21:34,122
with that test at that point.

334
00:21:34,562 --> 00:21:39,386
Um, that's a huge challenge and it, it, you can see it in games like Magic, a pretty

335
00:21:39,386 --> 00:21:41,568
sophisticated timing structure.

336
00:21:41,568 --> 00:21:45,371
Um, I think their online implementation has done a really good job but they have this

337
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:49,454
same problem where they interface at all sorts of complex timings with their rule structure.

338
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:58,727
Additionally, the other kind of effect that we rely on a lot for development is these kind of in-person social effects.

339
00:21:58,727 --> 00:22:06,915
We can do things, tactical things, with elements of the table, and of the componentry on the table, that are interesting in the rules.

340
00:22:06,915 --> 00:22:16,563
We can do interesting social things, like this is an insanity that you can get in the game that causes you to not be able to speak, like in real life, for the rest of the game to your teammates.

341
00:22:16,784 --> 00:22:21,889
Um, obviously things like this, uh, are a little more difficult to develop, uh, with

342
00:22:21,889 --> 00:22:24,091
straight digital integration.

343
00:22:24,091 --> 00:22:34,042
Um, an example, an example of this, um, is this actually pretty unique game by Harebrained

344
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:35,343
Schemes called Golem Arcana.

345
00:22:36,725 --> 00:22:41,072
Um, so this is a miniatures game where you play, um, you control these different golems

346
00:22:41,072 --> 00:22:46,641
on this grid and they fight and it uses this really interesting pen interface that links

347
00:22:46,641 --> 00:22:51,488
to your phone and scans each of the models and keeps track of them throughout the game.

348
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:56,744
It's pretty cool, but as you can see, there's not a lot of componentry, which is a benefit,

349
00:22:56,744 --> 00:23:01,448
but all of the game execution is happening on those apps.

350
00:23:01,448 --> 00:23:05,871
So because of that, any time they want to develop new content, they need a programmer,

351
00:23:05,871 --> 00:23:13,617
they need to script it into the game, and they're constrained by what the digital systems

352
00:23:13,617 --> 00:23:14,558
can handle.

353
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:19,281
They can't kind of explore that freedom that we normally can with the tabletop space.

354
00:23:20,112 --> 00:23:26,197
So because of that, the kind of lesson we learned from this challenge that we ran into

355
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:31,760
was kind of how to split up, divide mechanics between those two spaces of the game, between

356
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,262
that tabletop side and that digital side.

357
00:23:34,808 --> 00:23:40,330
Um, we divided, we chose mechanics and divided them up pretty specifically into each space

358
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:44,851
and tried to be as uncompromising as possible about how often they crossed over between

359
00:23:44,851 --> 00:23:45,271
those two.

360
00:23:45,271 --> 00:23:49,192
Um, every time they crossed over it can create kind of a messy point.

361
00:23:49,192 --> 00:23:54,554
Uh, for example in mansions, one of the things we didn't do so well was fire.

362
00:23:54,554 --> 00:23:57,915
Uh, fire is represented by these little tokens, they go on the board, if you walk in them

363
00:23:57,915 --> 00:23:58,515
they do you damage.

364
00:23:58,515 --> 00:23:59,975
It's, it's pretty straightforward.

365
00:24:01,016 --> 00:24:05,138
But we wanted things in the app to care about whether the mansion was on fire.

366
00:24:05,138 --> 00:24:07,199
We wanted like monsters to care.

367
00:24:07,199 --> 00:24:08,720
We wanted mythos events to care.

368
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,600
We wanted the fire to spread.

369
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,041
And all of this was handled by the app.

370
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:16,764
And so because of this, this simple little fire token was existing in both worlds.

371
00:24:16,764 --> 00:24:21,566
And what ended up having to happen is if you go into the main menu of mansions while you're

372
00:24:21,566 --> 00:24:24,688
playing, there's just a big old set fire button taking up one of our menu slots.

373
00:24:24,688 --> 00:24:27,069
Because it was the only way we could...

374
00:24:27,649 --> 00:24:32,293
get into the app that a fire had started through tabletop mechanics. So as you can see, that's

375
00:24:32,293 --> 00:24:37,778
a pretty kludgy solution to this problem, but it's, it's immediately created by a mechanic

376
00:24:37,778 --> 00:24:43,083
kind of straddling both sides. Um, so when we have mechanics that stay completely encapsulated

377
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:47,246
on one side, um, we avoid kind of those interfacing problems, which I'll talk about a bit later

378
00:24:47,246 --> 00:24:47,607
as well. Um.

379
00:24:50,627 --> 00:24:55,088
So the next thing, so once we divided those mechanics

380
00:24:55,088 --> 00:24:57,248
between the tabletop and digital,

381
00:24:57,248 --> 00:24:59,689
it allowed us to start really leveraging

382
00:24:59,689 --> 00:25:01,609
the strengths of both sides.

383
00:25:01,609 --> 00:25:05,110
And one of the places that really succeeded for us

384
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:08,771
was the ability to conceal complexity.

385
00:25:08,771 --> 00:25:09,971
Remember Arkham from earlier?

386
00:25:09,971 --> 00:25:11,691
This mess?

387
00:25:11,691 --> 00:25:13,812
Our games get a little complex.

388
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:16,552
We like to create a lot of content

389
00:25:16,552 --> 00:25:17,293
and keep our players,

390
00:25:18,713 --> 00:25:24,916
receiving fresh new writing all the time and telling fresh new stories. Um, tabletop games

391
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:29,358
by necessity put this all up front. Think about walking up to this as a new player. You know,

392
00:25:29,358 --> 00:25:32,099
you've just gone, gone over to your friend's house and they're like, no, no, it's going to be

393
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:34,340
easy, I swear. Now, behold, um...

394
00:25:35,963 --> 00:25:43,029
It's, it's pretty intimidating. But Mansions is different. Mansions has even more content than

395
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:47,673
this in actuality. However, you don't see any of it. In fact, the players only know, really

396
00:25:47,673 --> 00:25:53,498
know, need to know three things to play the game, which is our three actions. They need to be able

397
00:25:53,498 --> 00:25:57,161
to know how to move around the board. They need to be able to attack monsters and they need,

398
00:25:57,161 --> 00:25:59,883
need to be able to interact with tokens.

399
00:26:00,794 --> 00:26:05,399
Um, so moving is pretty straightforward, you just take your figure and move it around the

400
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:09,764
board. So we don't really talk about that. But these other two fairly simple actions that are

401
00:26:09,764 --> 00:26:14,910
just clicking on a monster and clicking on a point of interest in the app, um, are both far

402
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:19,876
more sophisticated, uh, than they originally seemed to a brand new player. Our attacks...

403
00:26:20,957 --> 00:26:22,819
They're based on the weapon type you're using.

404
00:26:22,819 --> 00:26:25,161
They can consider all sorts of factors.

405
00:26:25,161 --> 00:26:28,064
They pull from based on the monster you're attacking.

406
00:26:28,064 --> 00:26:31,207
They can pull from story relevant information.

407
00:26:31,207 --> 00:26:36,893
They can consider all sorts of factors that are going on in the game itself.

408
00:26:36,893 --> 00:26:38,614
All with a single push of a button.

409
00:26:38,614 --> 00:26:41,517
Similarly, once you interact with a point of interest in the story.

410
00:26:42,238 --> 00:26:47,163
Um, these are interacting with the state machines we put together with Playmaker. Um, when you

411
00:26:47,163 --> 00:26:51,388
interact, you're getting story writing, you're making interesting choices about the branching

412
00:26:51,388 --> 00:26:55,873
narrative, you're seeing the repercussions of your past choices, you're exploring new rooms

413
00:26:55,873 --> 00:26:59,998
which place new tiles, you're managing the branching narrative, all of this is managed by

414
00:26:59,998 --> 00:27:00,418
the app.

415
00:27:00,918 --> 00:27:05,000
all at the push of a button with just a few selections by the players.

416
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,222
So it's taking this incredibly complex system and making it incredibly easy for new players to interface with.

417
00:27:11,222 --> 00:27:15,063
And I think this approach has really shown in our reviews.

418
00:27:15,063 --> 00:27:18,504
For those of you who aren't aware, there's this website called BoardGameGeek.

419
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:23,246
It's basically the IMDB of board games. It allows users to post all sorts of stuff.

420
00:27:23,246 --> 00:27:26,347
It has all the information you need on board games.

421
00:27:26,347 --> 00:27:29,548
And one of the things it has is a complexity rating for each game.

422
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:32,551
This is created by the users.

423
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:38,493
Now as you can see here, our original complexity rating for first edition was 3.24, and with

424
00:27:38,493 --> 00:27:47,637
second edition, we reduced that by over 20% down to 2.65, all while having over a dozen,

425
00:27:47,637 --> 00:27:53,539
like over 12 times the content that Mansion's first data had in that core box.

426
00:27:57,758 --> 00:28:00,740
there's a downside that many of you probably have seen to this

427
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:04,302
and that it's we actually had to develop that complexity uh...

428
00:28:04,302 --> 00:28:07,444
tabletop developers don't often get the chance to just

429
00:28:07,444 --> 00:28:09,505
run wild we're really limited by

430
00:28:09,505 --> 00:28:11,546
uh... the budgets on our

431
00:28:11,546 --> 00:28:12,427
uh... printed components

432
00:28:12,427 --> 00:28:16,850
you know we have x number of cards that we can afford to put in a box and that's

433
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:17,130
it

434
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:17,850
but now

435
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:21,753
the sky was the limit and our eyes got a little bigger than our stomach

436
00:28:21,753 --> 00:28:24,174
in fact they got a lot bigger than our stomachs

437
00:28:25,989 --> 00:28:34,277
So here is a sample of what we originally planned to put in the game. Um, so we originally

438
00:28:34,277 --> 00:28:39,783
planned to have five of these branching scenarios for you to play. Each with what we, uh,

439
00:28:39,783 --> 00:28:43,527
four what we call alt maps, which are basically, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

440
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:48,008
kind of maps that we randomized some of our maps but these were

441
00:28:48,008 --> 00:28:51,450
more sophisticated rebuilds of the maps placing them in

442
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:54,871
different locations and such. Um so that gave you 20 different

443
00:28:54,871 --> 00:28:58,313
map significantly different maps to play on. We had 9 different

444
00:28:58,313 --> 00:29:01,414
monster types with 5 attack types each. We had 6 types of

445
00:29:01,414 --> 00:29:05,076
mythos events and we wanted like oh let's throw 2 dozen of each

446
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:08,418
mythos type into these 6 types. We had puzzles each with skins

447
00:29:08,418 --> 00:29:09,378
um.

448
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:16,224
So as you can see, this is a pretty big list. But then on top of this, this game was coming out

449
00:29:16,224 --> 00:29:22,809
fairly soon after the first edition of our game. And a lot of players were still playing that and

450
00:29:22,809 --> 00:29:27,333
had just bought it. And we didn't want them to feel like that was invalidated. So the decision

451
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:34,459
was made to integrate and make compatible all of the first edition content. Which is awesome. It's

452
00:29:34,459 --> 00:29:36,942
really exciting. You can use all your miniatures. But for us...

453
00:29:39,261 --> 00:29:43,506
these numbers ballooned a bit. Uh, we added 3 extra alt maps,

454
00:29:43,506 --> 00:29:47,651
uh, to each thing to use the first edition tiles. We added

455
00:29:47,651 --> 00:29:50,935
all sorts of monsters, we added a whole new mythos type to fit

456
00:29:50,935 --> 00:29:53,659
with these new types of tiles that were coming in. Um...

457
00:29:54,698 --> 00:30:01,901
This got really out of hand. Dev ballooned out of control. Um, we ended up having to make a ton

458
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:05,902
of cuts to the final game from this planned content. Uh, the core game only had four

459
00:30:05,902 --> 00:30:10,643
scenarios in it with a lot fewer alt maps and a lot of these, uh, attack types and events and

460
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:15,065
stuff we had to, had reduced variability early on in the game. Um, so we had to, uh,

461
00:30:15,744 --> 00:30:20,166
because of how much bigger our eyes got than our stomachs.

462
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:23,568
Luckily, now that the game's been out for several years and we have a lot of expansions,

463
00:30:23,568 --> 00:30:28,270
we've been able to fill out a lot of that variety by patching stuff into the game.

464
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:32,332
But at launch, we had to cut a lot of this content because of how much our development

465
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:33,433
was ballooning out of control.

466
00:30:34,694 --> 00:30:38,398
Um, on top of all of this, this is all being created by tabletop developers who, as we

467
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:41,242
mentioned, aren't great at coding.

468
00:30:41,242 --> 00:30:45,187
Um, we, we had a lot of bugs.

469
00:30:45,187 --> 00:30:49,372
And um, our tabletop testers, they're not software QA people.

470
00:30:49,372 --> 00:30:50,513
They, you know, uh,

471
00:30:51,414 --> 00:30:56,275
don't have the skills necessary to hunt down and squash all of our bugs. So in fact, uh, our

472
00:30:56,275 --> 00:31:00,777
media people, our, our small number of programmers ended up having to be the people who

473
00:31:00,777 --> 00:31:05,338
were squashing a lot of the bugs created by tabletop people. Um, you know, we, we tried to

474
00:31:05,338 --> 00:31:10,039
hunt down our own bugs, but we were only so good at it. So poor Mark over there had spent way

475
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:12,319
too much time squashing our bugs. Um...

476
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:17,576
these delays, all of that development delay, all of these

477
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:21,358
bugs added up. This project really went on a long time. Um,

478
00:31:21,358 --> 00:31:24,019
in fact it went on so long that Road to Legend, which I

479
00:31:24,019 --> 00:31:27,981
mentioned earlier, the next game to use this, this back end that

480
00:31:27,981 --> 00:31:31,242
we developed here, actually came out before us. Um, so we, we

481
00:31:31,242 --> 00:31:36,664
took a while. Um, so on top of all of this development

482
00:31:36,664 --> 00:31:37,765
ballooning out of control...

483
00:31:39,037 --> 00:31:44,679
Um, we discovered something on the mechanical side of things, um, in, in the game systems,

484
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:48,841
which was, um, our game had a serious lack of transparency.

485
00:31:48,841 --> 00:31:52,863
What I mean by this was the players were having trouble knowing everything that was going

486
00:31:52,863 --> 00:31:53,264
on.

487
00:31:53,264 --> 00:31:56,945
We created all this complexity, we created all this interesting decision making, but

488
00:31:56,945 --> 00:31:59,567
our players weren't seeing it.

489
00:31:59,567 --> 00:32:04,889
Um, I think, upon reflection, I think a lot of this problem arises from the mediums, this

490
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:07,631
kind of difference of tabletop and digital that we've been talking about.

491
00:32:08,442 --> 00:32:15,466
Um, tabletop games are transparent by default. Um, everything in a tabletop game, when you

492
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:18,908
take it out of the box, you can read it all. You can see everything. You have to understand

493
00:32:18,908 --> 00:32:22,970
basically every rule in the game to start playing. Obviously that's not true. People

494
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:27,513
play Magic without reading the 140 page rule book or whatever. But, um, you need to have

495
00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:31,655
a full understanding of the game to play for, for tabletop games. They start transparent.

496
00:32:31,655 --> 00:32:35,497
Every mechanic is default transparent until you deliberately hide it from the players

497
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:36,878
and tell them to hide it.

498
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:41,801
Meanwhile, on the digital side of things, everything starts opaque.

499
00:32:41,801 --> 00:32:45,983
You have a black screen until you add graphics, until you add UI elements, until you add sound.

500
00:32:45,983 --> 00:32:50,864
Um, all, anything you want your players to know about what's in the digital side of things,

501
00:32:50,864 --> 00:32:52,485
you have to deliberately put into the game.

502
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:57,462
Um, and so, you know, a lot of this, as we talked about, was being developed by tabletop

503
00:32:57,462 --> 00:33:03,865
developers and so, uh, they weren't used to having to put all of this, uh, transparency

504
00:33:03,865 --> 00:33:05,126
into their game.

505
00:33:05,126 --> 00:33:09,748
And so, one of the issues we ran into with Mansions is that our primary interface were

506
00:33:09,748 --> 00:33:10,908
these text boxes.

507
00:33:10,908 --> 00:33:13,229
As you can see, the UI is pretty sparse otherwise.

508
00:33:13,229 --> 00:33:17,651
But we have a lot of sophisticated information about how these scenarios are running that

509
00:33:17,651 --> 00:33:18,972
we want to communicate to the player.

510
00:33:19,452 --> 00:33:23,414
Um, so all of that information ended up having to come across in these text boxes.

511
00:33:23,414 --> 00:33:28,576
Um, as a result we ended up spending a lot of time in these scenarios that we kind of

512
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:31,857
wish we could have been, uh, telling stories.

513
00:33:31,857 --> 00:33:35,618
We had to spend explaining to them how the game worked and explaining to them how the

514
00:33:35,618 --> 00:33:39,580
game worked again and again and again.

515
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:44,381
A lot of our scenarios get pretty bogged down with just mechanical text as a result.

516
00:33:44,381 --> 00:33:45,102
Um.

517
00:33:46,429 --> 00:33:51,173
We learned from this in our later iterations like here is the imperial assault app, Legends

518
00:33:51,173 --> 00:33:52,914
of the Alliance.

519
00:33:52,914 --> 00:33:56,076
We learned from it, we put a lot of our information front and center.

520
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:59,979
You have a lot more sophisticated information up front that allows you to kind of see what's

521
00:33:59,979 --> 00:34:05,183
going on and these are a lot of things that in mansions we may have had to give you text

522
00:34:05,183 --> 00:34:07,404
notifications about.

523
00:34:07,404 --> 00:34:07,624
But

524
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:13,586
in Mansions it was a pretty big challenge for us. But it ended up being something we learned a lot

525
00:34:13,586 --> 00:34:18,288
about for making these kinds of games in the future, which is that when you're separating

526
00:34:18,288 --> 00:34:22,649
the mechanics between the tabletop side and the digital side and being uncompromising about how

527
00:34:22,649 --> 00:34:27,750
often they cross over, one of the great ways to decide, beyond those strengths we talked about

528
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:28,891
earlier, to decide, uh...

529
00:34:30,031 --> 00:34:36,112
which side a mechanic would probably be strongest in is based on the opacity of that mechanic.

530
00:34:36,112 --> 00:34:40,373
Is this something that should be hidden to the player by default? Then it probably belongs in

531
00:34:40,373 --> 00:34:44,554
the digital side of your game. It'll be a lot less work to work on that mechanic. Is this something

532
00:34:44,554 --> 00:34:48,515
that's transparent by default? You might want it on the tabletop side of your game because the

533
00:34:48,515 --> 00:34:50,816
player's going to see all of it right at the start.

534
00:34:52,585 --> 00:34:59,973
And once we got a handle on this difference, and what it meant to us, and on how opaque digital games can be,

535
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:01,675
this opacity was actually super useful to us.

536
00:35:01,675 --> 00:35:08,261
One of the biggest strengths of Mansions, in the end, and one of the things fans love about it,

537
00:35:08,261 --> 00:35:10,524
is the sense of discovery it gets.

538
00:35:10,524 --> 00:35:16,310
As I mentioned, everything in a tabletop game starts out very transparent to the player.

539
00:35:18,062 --> 00:35:22,584
Um, but we could hide things from the players. We could truly surprise them. We could allow

540
00:35:22,584 --> 00:35:28,866
them to interact with hidden information in really sophisticated ways. Um, and it also

541
00:35:28,866 --> 00:35:33,868
allowed for really strengthened replayability. As you saw in the component list, we only

542
00:35:33,868 --> 00:35:38,290
had four scenarios, so we wanted people to be able to play these a lot. And in fact, um, I'm

543
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:43,672
gonna give an example from the game. So minor spoilers for, uh, the very first scenario.

544
00:35:43,672 --> 00:35:44,732
It's called Cycle of Eternity.

545
00:35:45,292 --> 00:35:52,480
Um, here are some of our Unity analytics. On cycle. Um, these are the number of people who

546
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,166
have played each of our scenarios. Uh, as you can see, COE over on the right. That's cycle of

547
00:35:57,166 --> 00:35:57,586
eternity.

548
00:35:58,797 --> 00:36:01,180
It gets played a lot.

549
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:04,443
It's kind of our default learning scenario, so it's a lot of people's entry points to

550
00:36:04,443 --> 00:36:05,364
the game.

551
00:36:05,364 --> 00:36:09,829
You know, you've played it a couple times, but you have that friend over who has never

552
00:36:09,829 --> 00:36:10,670
played Mansions before.

553
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:15,015
All right, well, we'll play Cycle again, because Cycle's a good intro.

554
00:36:15,015 --> 00:36:19,019
And so game groups will play Cycle over and over again, because it, as they bring new

555
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:19,740
people into the game.

556
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:24,123
So, it's also our learning scenario, and so it's a lot simpler and shorter than a lot

557
00:36:24,123 --> 00:36:28,506
of others, so it lacked that variance that a lot of our other scenarios get.

558
00:36:28,506 --> 00:36:34,470
So in it, we actually got a really cool opportunity to kind of surprise people a bit.

559
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:38,293
So actually, the picture I've been showing is from Cycle of Eternity.

560
00:36:38,293 --> 00:36:40,755
This is the Vanderbilt estate you are...

561
00:36:41,375 --> 00:36:44,837
investigating the mysterious William Vanderbilt.

562
00:36:44,837 --> 00:36:50,039
You arrive at the mansion and you meet his befuddled but kindly butler Eugene.

563
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:52,901
He's worried that something's going on with his master.

564
00:36:52,901 --> 00:36:56,603
And the spoiler is William Vanderbilt's a cultist.

565
00:36:56,603 --> 00:37:00,925
He's worshipping an elder god because everybody does in this setting.

566
00:37:00,925 --> 00:37:03,546
And he's trying to open a portal or something evil.

567
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:08,424
So that's how the game played out most of the time.

568
00:37:08,424 --> 00:37:10,125
You help Eugene helps you.

569
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:14,947
You find William Vanderbilt and you foil his plans.

570
00:37:14,947 --> 00:37:16,867
But we realized that we kind of wanted

571
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:18,448
to surprise these players who were playing

572
00:37:18,448 --> 00:37:20,209
the scenario so many times.

573
00:37:20,209 --> 00:37:24,190
So we added a random roll at the beginning of the game

574
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:27,131
that determined a kind of Easter egg variance,

575
00:37:27,131 --> 00:37:29,392
maybe like one in every 10 times.

576
00:37:29,392 --> 00:37:31,253
Two seconds.

577
00:37:34,311 --> 00:37:39,155
Um, we added this random variant in where one out of every ten times, uh, you get to

578
00:37:39,155 --> 00:37:45,059
the big finale and William Vanderbilt is completely innocent and it turns out that his butler

579
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:48,662
Eugene has been evil the entire time.

580
00:37:48,662 --> 00:37:51,704
Um, and so this was a really awesome cute surprise for players.

581
00:37:51,704 --> 00:37:55,787
People would talk about it on our forums, talk about, you know, totally Eugene was evil

582
00:37:55,787 --> 00:37:59,070
and people would be like, I've played this scenario like ten times and Eugene was never

583
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,111
evil, you're crazy.

584
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,912
Um, this is something...

585
00:38:02,472 --> 00:38:03,874
You know, it's a cute little thing.

586
00:38:03,874 --> 00:38:08,318
You know, a lot of digital games could do it really easily, but in tabletop, it's nearly

587
00:38:08,318 --> 00:38:13,383
impossible to surprise players like this and to truly give them that sense.

588
00:38:13,383 --> 00:38:17,587
This is one example, but the game is full of this little sense of discovery.

589
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:20,810
We have maps where we keep most of the map the same, so you think you've seen it before

590
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:22,792
and then you open a door and a room's different.

591
00:38:22,792 --> 00:38:26,115
There's all these little things that we can kind of hide from the players.

592
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:32,680
and uh, kind of give them these surprises. Additionally, as I

593
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,621
mentioned, uh, this game branches a lot. Um, and this

594
00:38:35,621 --> 00:38:38,241
also gives kind of players the ability to kind of discover

595
00:38:38,241 --> 00:38:42,262
what we've created. Um, this is obviously an oversimplification,

596
00:38:42,262 --> 00:38:46,263
but our main plots will kind of branch out from different nodes

597
00:38:46,263 --> 00:38:49,544
to different possibilities, um, ending in different things. Um,

598
00:38:49,544 --> 00:38:52,765
so this gives you some replayability. Um, you know, you

599
00:38:52,765 --> 00:38:54,825
can play through the scenario a couple times before you feel

600
00:38:54,825 --> 00:38:56,926
like you've seen it all, but then in every scenario, in

601
00:38:56,926 --> 00:38:58,346
addition to these main plots.

602
00:38:58,826 --> 00:39:05,169
we try to kind of weave in various side plots that are entirely independent and can kind of go

603
00:39:05,169 --> 00:39:10,792
one way or the other and so ideally by the time you multiply out three or four side plots in

604
00:39:10,792 --> 00:39:15,034
combination with the main plot going on with you know four different players playing

605
00:39:15,034 --> 00:39:19,237
investigators they've never played before you kind of get this interesting emergent

606
00:39:19,237 --> 00:39:23,679
combination that you've never seen before and so it allows for each scenario to play very

607
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:27,741
differently and it's something that we've been pretty happy with. Additionally...

608
00:39:28,731 --> 00:39:34,875
We added on an extra layer of randomness onto this to kind of give you that variance play

609
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:36,976
to play which was our mythos events.

610
00:39:36,976 --> 00:39:41,519
I touched on them a little earlier but basically they're just random horrible things that can

611
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:44,421
happen to the investigators as they play.

612
00:39:44,421 --> 00:39:48,503
And as you saw we developed a lot of them and now there's really a lot of them.

613
00:39:48,503 --> 00:39:50,805
We have hundreds of these things.

614
00:39:51,104 --> 00:39:54,249
Um, and we put all sorts of different writers on. We grab people from the, throughout the

615
00:39:54,249 --> 00:39:59,136
studio to write mythos events. They're actually quite fun, um, and these mythos events, they

616
00:39:59,136 --> 00:40:05,285
pull from this random, uh, this massive list, but we tie specific conditions to each one. So

617
00:40:05,285 --> 00:40:06,847
things like what rooms are in...

618
00:40:07,568 --> 00:40:10,749
things that the app knows, what rooms are in the game right now, what choices have the

619
00:40:10,749 --> 00:40:15,390
players made, what monsters are on the table, what items are on the table. Um, we also have

620
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:18,111
this threat system which is kind of like the director from Left 4 Dead in the sense that

621
00:40:18,111 --> 00:40:20,832
it knows how well or poorly the players are doing and can kind of ramp up or ramp down

622
00:40:20,832 --> 00:40:24,333
the threat to kind of keep the pacing interesting for them. Um, mostly using these mythos events.

623
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:24,393
Um.

624
00:40:24,393 --> 00:40:24,573
Right.

625
00:40:24,573 --> 00:40:24,813
Right.

626
00:40:24,813 --> 00:40:25,113
Right.

627
00:40:25,113 --> 00:40:25,373
Yeah.

628
00:40:25,373 --> 00:40:25,473
Um.

629
00:40:25,473 --> 00:40:25,533
Um.

630
00:40:25,533 --> 00:40:25,613
Um.

631
00:40:25,613 --> 00:40:25,774
Right.

632
00:40:25,774 --> 00:40:25,894
Right.

633
00:40:25,894 --> 00:40:26,134
Right.

634
00:40:26,134 --> 00:40:26,314
Right.

635
00:40:26,314 --> 00:40:26,414
Uh.

636
00:40:26,414 --> 00:40:26,594
Right.

637
00:40:26,594 --> 00:40:26,754
Right.

638
00:40:26,754 --> 00:40:26,974
Right.

639
00:40:26,974 --> 00:40:27,234
Left.

640
00:40:27,234 --> 00:40:28,034
Right.

641
00:40:28,034 --> 00:40:28,254
Left.

642
00:40:28,254 --> 00:40:28,514
Left.

643
00:40:28,514 --> 00:40:28,674
Right.

644
00:40:28,674 --> 00:40:29,555
That's what's it's all about.

645
00:40:29,555 --> 00:40:29,635
Um.

646
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:29,835
Right.

647
00:40:29,835 --> 00:40:29,955
Um.

648
00:40:29,955 --> 00:40:30,055
Right.

649
00:40:30,055 --> 00:40:30,195
Right.

650
00:40:30,195 --> 00:40:30,355
Right.

651
00:40:30,355 --> 00:40:30,435
Um.

652
00:40:30,435 --> 00:40:31,275
Right.

653
00:40:31,844 --> 00:40:36,787
And so we developed this system, and this has also worked out great for us,

654
00:40:36,787 --> 00:40:41,091
but it caused us to make an interesting discovery

655
00:40:41,091 --> 00:40:44,894
which is that we don't really see in tabletop games that often,

656
00:40:44,894 --> 00:40:50,979
which is players create intent out of randomness.

657
00:40:53,005 --> 00:40:57,487
we spent all this time linking these events to like, you know, make them feel like they had

658
00:40:57,487 --> 00:41:02,909
meaning in a scenario. But players will ascribe meaning to the most random things. Um, in

659
00:41:02,909 --> 00:41:07,090
tabletop, they always know that's random. You know, they roll the die, they draw the card,

660
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:10,932
they know that that was completely random chance and that nothing else fed into it.

661
00:41:11,412 --> 00:41:14,193
But in the digital side, because of that assumed opacity,

662
00:41:14,193 --> 00:41:16,334
the players' imaginations run wild.

663
00:41:16,334 --> 00:41:19,635
They think that that mythos event coming up

664
00:41:19,635 --> 00:41:20,816
means something in the story.

665
00:41:20,816 --> 00:41:23,517
They think that, oh, this is based on my choice from earlier.

666
00:41:23,517 --> 00:41:26,318
They create all this meaning that we just,

667
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:29,799
it's nearly impossible for us to create in a tabletop space

668
00:41:29,799 --> 00:41:32,200
because of how clear that is to the players.

669
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,901
And I think my favorite example

670
00:41:34,901 --> 00:41:37,823
of kind of using the players' hypothesizing is

671
00:41:38,503 --> 00:41:41,084
So when the director, when our threat system is low and it's

672
00:41:41,084 --> 00:41:43,684
it's giving them kind of a reprieve, we'll give them some

673
00:41:43,684 --> 00:41:47,346
flavor text and we'll say, uh, know it like, you know, uh, the

674
00:41:47,346 --> 00:41:51,307
wind, uh, whistles through the, uh, through, in the mansion

675
00:41:51,307 --> 00:41:54,348
creeks. No effect. Right? This is fine. Player's new, no

676
00:41:54,348 --> 00:41:57,749
effect. Okay, we got a break for the round. Um, but that didn't

677
00:41:57,749 --> 00:42:01,830
quite work for our Lovecrafty horror theme. So with one si-

678
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:07,052
simple word, we changed no effect to no immediate effect.

679
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,441
This was amazing.

680
00:42:11,441 --> 00:42:16,185
Players get so mad about no immediate effect.

681
00:42:16,185 --> 00:42:20,409
They hypothesize about what that could mean.

682
00:42:20,409 --> 00:42:22,690
When they make a choice and it just pops out no immediate

683
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:25,673
effect, they're like, what's going to happen?

684
00:42:25,673 --> 00:42:29,035
This added to that sense of dread that we wanted in a

685
00:42:29,035 --> 00:42:31,177
Lovecraft game.

686
00:42:31,177 --> 00:42:34,059
And so we kind of played to that strength of the digital

687
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:35,000
side and that opacity.

688
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,902
And that turned out great for us.

689
00:42:37,923 --> 00:42:43,127
Another example of this to kind of go to another app integrated game that uses hidden

690
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:50,054
information in the digital side really well is this game called Alchemist. This is kind of a

691
00:42:50,054 --> 00:42:54,838
cool game. So it's a deduction game like Clue. But instead of

692
00:42:55,977 --> 00:43:00,802
there being like a murder mystery, there are alchemical formulas that you need to know.

693
00:43:00,802 --> 00:43:05,267
There are all sorts of ingredients in the game. You can kind of see them, they're the cards

694
00:43:05,267 --> 00:43:11,273
perched near the top of the little dividers. And each one has like elemental principles tied to

695
00:43:11,273 --> 00:43:14,656
them and based on how those elements combine they form potions.

696
00:43:15,457 --> 00:43:19,519
But you don't know which elements are tied to which components every time you play.

697
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:22,780
And so you just have to experiment by mashing these components together and making potions

698
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:27,203
and maybe blowing yourself up until you figure out the deduction puzzle.

699
00:43:27,203 --> 00:43:33,626
This game is cool because its app does something that Clue never could, which is in Clue, the

700
00:43:33,626 --> 00:43:37,268
moment you check the file to see if you're right, the game is over for you.

701
00:43:37,688 --> 00:43:41,910
you've seen that hidden information and you've ruined the game for you but the app allows us to

702
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:46,952
check against that hidden information in really sophisticated ways. So in alchemists it can

703
00:43:46,952 --> 00:43:53,415
constantly every time you uh use that you use those components it's checking against that hidden

704
00:43:53,415 --> 00:43:58,217
information and giving you an output based on that. Um that's something that a tabletop game

705
00:43:58,217 --> 00:44:01,939
can't do without a dedicated player who's basically playing the system.

706
00:44:02,379 --> 00:44:05,803
And that's how Alchemist gets around it if you don't have an app, is they have a role for

707
00:44:05,803 --> 00:44:09,848
somebody who just sits there and tells you what happens with your potions, but the app

708
00:44:09,848 --> 00:44:15,554
allows that player to be able to play the game instead, which is really nice.

709
00:44:15,554 --> 00:44:16,836
So back to mansions.

710
00:44:18,728 --> 00:44:24,252
So we, you know, we went through these trials and travails and, um, finally, after all this

711
00:44:24,252 --> 00:44:26,814
hard work, we're getting to the end of the game.

712
00:44:26,814 --> 00:44:30,637
Uh, we're reaching the end of development, which for tabletop games still means there's

713
00:44:30,637 --> 00:44:34,820
like nine months before it actually, uh, is on store shelves, but, uh, we're reaching

714
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,501
the end and it's time to announce the game.

715
00:44:36,501 --> 00:44:39,583
And unfortunately this was another road bump for it, which was...

716
00:44:41,135 --> 00:44:48,961
announcement was a little rocky. Um public reaction wasn't great. Uh when we first

717
00:44:48,961 --> 00:44:55,266
announced it um there was a lot of skepticism about the app integrated format. Uh we saw a

718
00:44:55,266 --> 00:45:00,249
little bit of this at with Xcom as well but when we were taking some first ed game that was

719
00:45:00,249 --> 00:45:01,770
exclusively um

720
00:45:03,468 --> 00:45:06,590
that was exclusively tabletop and making it app integrated.

721
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:10,333
Um, there's a lot of resistance to this. Um, people were concerned about

722
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:13,536
will my platform be supported? Will I be able to play it on X or Y?

723
00:45:13,536 --> 00:45:18,580
Um, will this game, uh, be able to be playable in twenty years with my

724
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:19,861
grandchildren or whatever else?

725
00:45:19,861 --> 00:45:20,822
Um, you know,

726
00:45:20,822 --> 00:45:24,325
I won't be able to play this board game after the nuclear apocalypse or whatever

727
00:45:24,325 --> 00:45:24,945
else. Um,

728
00:45:24,945 --> 00:45:28,148
this app is going to be a hassle.

729
00:45:29,346 --> 00:45:33,691
So there was a lot of skepticism but we were really confident in the product. We really

730
00:45:33,691 --> 00:45:39,999
liked the game and so we were confident that when it launched people would like the game.

731
00:45:39,999 --> 00:45:44,845
But then our launch came and our launch was really buggy.

732
00:45:46,465 --> 00:45:50,631
All those bugs I mentioned earlier, it turns out we didn't manage to squash them all.

733
00:45:50,631 --> 00:45:53,535
And we had a lot of stability issues at launch.

734
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:58,301
You can see here, this is a super unofficial poll from BoardGameGeek.

735
00:45:58,301 --> 00:46:03,328
On certain platforms, certain scenarios crashed fatally, like a third of the time.

736
00:46:04,169 --> 00:46:10,091
we had a bunch of annoying, and this is on top of a bunch of annoying small bugs that were also

737
00:46:10,091 --> 00:46:16,514
plaguing users constantly. To our programmers credit, they got on it super fast. And like

738
00:46:16,514 --> 00:46:22,616
after a week or two of panic we had gotten the build a lot more stable, but this kind of

739
00:46:22,616 --> 00:46:28,199
strengthened those original skepticisms about the app integrated format and that was a pretty

740
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:34,782
uh, rocky place for us. Um, I think the main takeaway from a lot, reading a lot of, um,

741
00:46:34,782 --> 00:46:41,865
people's skepticism though is, uh, ties into my last point, which is, um, why is the app

742
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:47,147
worth the hassle? This sentiment is something that we saw kind of over and over again, like,

743
00:46:47,147 --> 00:46:50,668
why not just make this a tabletop game? Why not, don't just make this a digital game?

744
00:46:50,668 --> 00:46:55,030
Why go through this pain in the ass to combine these two formats when I could just get one

745
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:56,271
of the other? Um.

746
00:46:57,127 --> 00:47:03,083
And so I think our last lesson and something that went really right with the game.

747
00:47:04,262 --> 00:47:08,145
is knowing the answer to this question and that the app needs

748
00:47:08,145 --> 00:47:09,125
to be justified.

749
00:47:09,125 --> 00:47:10,526
Its inclusion needs to be justified.

750
00:47:10,526 --> 00:47:13,388
I think I've talked a bit about some of the things

751
00:47:13,388 --> 00:47:14,548
that the app has done for us.

752
00:47:14,548 --> 00:47:17,530
We feel like it's worth it.

753
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:19,391
So what's the last element here?

754
00:47:19,391 --> 00:47:23,094
Well, what is the hassle of the app?

755
00:47:23,094 --> 00:47:26,956
Some people might say, oh, it's pretty easy to use.

756
00:47:26,956 --> 00:47:27,997
There is no hassle.

757
00:47:27,997 --> 00:47:30,918
But let's talk a bit about the hassle and minimizing it,

758
00:47:30,918 --> 00:47:32,599
because I think it's something we did pretty well.

759
00:47:33,419 --> 00:47:38,301
Um, so this is something I think I just kind of started using this term interfacing, but

760
00:47:38,301 --> 00:47:43,343
basically this is the concept of any time your system has to cross over from the tabletop

761
00:47:43,343 --> 00:47:48,485
to the app, or from the app to the tabletop, any time those two sides of the system need

762
00:47:48,485 --> 00:47:49,585
to interface with each other.

763
00:47:49,585 --> 00:47:56,348
Um, this can be done in myriad ways, but, uh, you know, like with audio cues, with text,

764
00:47:56,348 --> 00:48:00,790
with tapping, with camera, um, some much more expensive than others.

765
00:48:02,989 --> 00:48:06,210
but this needs to be done in some way because we've so

766
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:08,711
strictly divided our mechanics between the two sides of the

767
00:48:08,711 --> 00:48:11,632
system and they're not aware of each other. Um, so in

768
00:48:11,632 --> 00:48:15,173
mansions, uh, the mansion, the app, it knows your story really

769
00:48:15,173 --> 00:48:17,134
well. It knows where you're at. Um.

770
00:48:18,681 --> 00:48:21,002
But it has no idea where the characters are on the map.

771
00:48:21,002 --> 00:48:22,563
That's entirely on the tabletop.

772
00:48:22,563 --> 00:48:23,763
It doesn't know where features are.

773
00:48:23,763 --> 00:48:25,484
It doesn't know where the items have ended up.

774
00:48:25,484 --> 00:48:26,865
It doesn't know where the monsters are.

775
00:48:26,865 --> 00:48:29,426
All of that gameplay is happening on your table.

776
00:48:29,426 --> 00:48:32,107
The app is just controlling a lot of the other aspects.

777
00:48:32,107 --> 00:48:36,529
And so anytime the app needs to know that,

778
00:48:36,529 --> 00:48:39,031
you need to be inputting into the app.

779
00:48:39,031 --> 00:48:40,951
And also, you don't know the story.

780
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:43,152
Anytime the app needs to tell you story

781
00:48:43,152 --> 00:48:46,554
or where to place tiles, it's outputting that information

782
00:48:46,554 --> 00:48:46,734
to you.

783
00:48:48,657 --> 00:48:52,721
And the problem with this is that any time a player spends

784
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:58,467
interfacing with the app at the table with other people is, uh,

785
00:48:58,467 --> 00:49:03,012
time away from the game. Yeah, I like that, that's a picture

786
00:49:03,012 --> 00:49:04,694
from Netrunner. Um, uh.

787
00:49:06,511 --> 00:49:10,413
all that time interfacing detracts from that tabletop experience. It's viewed by the players

788
00:49:10,413 --> 00:49:15,396
as work and hassle. Every moment that, you know, um, your friend over there is sitting

789
00:49:15,396 --> 00:49:20,918
with their face in the phone waiting to see what will come out of it, um, is just kind of

790
00:49:20,918 --> 00:49:22,979
viewed as wasted time. Um...

791
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,662
Now there's many innovative ways kind of around this.

792
00:49:26,662 --> 00:49:28,964
You know, Alchemists that I showed earlier

793
00:49:28,964 --> 00:49:32,706
uses image recognition to view the components.

794
00:49:32,706 --> 00:49:35,428
This game here, World of Yoho by Yelo is pretty cool.

795
00:49:35,428 --> 00:49:40,192
The game mat has spaces that are roughly the size of phones.

796
00:49:40,192 --> 00:49:42,573
And the phones actually show the board through them

797
00:49:42,573 --> 00:49:44,155
and you place them on the map.

798
00:49:44,155 --> 00:49:45,315
And actually it works pretty well.

799
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,297
They use the accelerometer in the phone

800
00:49:47,297 --> 00:49:48,738
to track where you've moved it around the map

801
00:49:48,738 --> 00:49:51,079
so it's constantly showing the right part of the map

802
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:52,701
and it can kind of reveal encounters and stuff.

803
00:49:53,962 --> 00:50:00,548
So it kind of gets that interfacing out of the way by directly integrating the phone into the game, which is pretty neat.

804
00:50:00,548 --> 00:50:04,211
We didn't really have that option. The stories we want to tell are pretty sophisticated,

805
00:50:04,211 --> 00:50:06,653
so we rely a lot on text. We have some narration,

806
00:50:06,653 --> 00:50:14,801
but we couldn't afford to narrate all of that mountain of content we wanted to do.

807
00:50:14,801 --> 00:50:14,941
And so,

808
00:50:14,941 --> 00:50:18,144
the question...

809
00:50:19,397 --> 00:50:24,220
Um, the question that helped us the most when we were kind of working on this, as we're

810
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:31,025
playing the game, asking yourself, uh, am I doing the work for the app or is the app

811
00:50:31,025 --> 00:50:32,606
doing the work for me?

812
00:50:32,606 --> 00:50:35,988
Um, this is, this gets down to the heart of the hassle.

813
00:50:35,988 --> 00:50:39,751
Do they feel like interacting with that app is a drain on their time?

814
00:50:39,751 --> 00:50:40,571
Um.

815
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:47,683
So when you're inputting, when you're doing that kind of stuff, it's going to be viewed

816
00:50:47,683 --> 00:50:49,083
as you doing work for the app.

817
00:50:49,083 --> 00:50:52,845
Whereas like when you're getting something out of the app, suddenly it feels like this

818
00:50:52,845 --> 00:50:55,326
is a benefit, a boon to the game.

819
00:50:55,326 --> 00:50:56,607
Here's an example.

820
00:50:56,607 --> 00:50:59,808
Road to Legend, which was the follow-up to Mansions, based on Descent.

821
00:50:59,808 --> 00:51:01,849
Because it was based on Descent...

822
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:08,612
each player activating mattered and when they activated mattered in descent. And so because of

823
00:51:08,612 --> 00:51:13,395
that, um, you can see over on the left there, every time you activated, you needed to click

824
00:51:13,395 --> 00:51:17,156
and turn on your own turn for all four players every round. Um...

825
00:51:18,017 --> 00:51:22,400
seems simple, it's like two taps, right? But this really drained on the players, they had to

826
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,842
remember to do this, they had to keep that in their mind, they had to be passing around the

827
00:51:25,842 --> 00:51:31,186
phone to do this on the phone. Um, this, this is kind of like that player at the table you need

828
00:51:31,186 --> 00:51:35,029
to constantly be reminding to take their turn, you're constantly reminding that app to take

829
00:51:35,029 --> 00:51:38,732
its turn. Um, and that was, that was viewed as real drain on the players.

830
00:51:39,472 --> 00:51:44,277
Um, contrast that with mansions, every time you're clicking on one of these nodes, we're

831
00:51:44,277 --> 00:51:49,421
giving you story, we're giving you rewards, we're giving you choices, um, we're giving

832
00:51:49,421 --> 00:51:49,921
you stuff.

833
00:51:49,921 --> 00:51:54,626
Uh, players never responded negatively to interacting with nodes on the app.

834
00:51:54,626 --> 00:51:56,768
They were excited, they wanted to see what was coming next.

835
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:02,625
Um, so the way we, but the problem is, as I mentioned, the Mansions app doesn't know

836
00:52:02,625 --> 00:52:04,807
a lot of things about what the players are doing.

837
00:52:04,807 --> 00:52:08,631
So what we tried to do is we tried to take this rewarding experience of getting something

838
00:52:08,631 --> 00:52:13,656
out of the app and harvest as much information from it as we possibly could.

839
00:52:13,656 --> 00:52:18,761
So when players are interacting with the app and getting stuff out, we try to look for

840
00:52:18,761 --> 00:52:20,703
every piece of information this gives us.

841
00:52:21,243 --> 00:52:23,464
when somebody interacts with an app we know that investigator is

842
00:52:23,464 --> 00:52:26,024
on that space cause they have to be in that space to interact

843
00:52:26,024 --> 00:52:28,885
with it. We know when they interacted with it, we know how

844
00:52:28,885 --> 00:52:31,546
well they did, we know the amount of damage we've given out

845
00:52:31,546 --> 00:52:33,687
to them, we know the amount, how close they are to losing the

846
00:52:33,687 --> 00:52:38,829
game. Um, so we kind of use these things that players view

847
00:52:38,829 --> 00:52:43,410
as beneficial to get just enough information to make the app seem

848
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:47,212
informed about what's going on on the table. Um, but I think

849
00:52:47,212 --> 00:52:48,352
there's a long way to go.

850
00:52:49,152 --> 00:52:54,237
in interfacing. I think we've succeeded pretty well in mansions, but I think it's one of the

851
00:52:54,237 --> 00:53:00,803
places that these kind of hybrid games can innovate the most. Image recognition and other

852
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:05,308
such technologies are going to allow us to kind of bridge this interfacing gap and make this feel

853
00:53:05,308 --> 00:53:11,033
like less of a hassle to players. In the end, I think...

854
00:53:12,413 --> 00:53:13,494
Mansions went pretty well.

855
00:53:13,494 --> 00:53:15,736
Despite, it may sound like Loom and Doom

856
00:53:15,736 --> 00:53:17,177
after I talked about the rocky reception,

857
00:53:17,177 --> 00:53:19,719
but actually after that initial bump,

858
00:53:19,719 --> 00:53:22,721
we got those bugs fixed and the game got great reviews.

859
00:53:22,721 --> 00:53:25,944
It's quite beloved and it's been going on

860
00:53:25,944 --> 00:53:28,206
with its expansions now for several years

861
00:53:28,206 --> 00:53:29,827
and it's doing incredibly well for us.

862
00:53:29,827 --> 00:53:33,430
So I think the big takeaways from Mansions development.

863
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:41,742
were obviously to prototype early, to prototype thoroughly, before you start development.

864
00:53:41,742 --> 00:53:46,744
Use that prototyping to be wary of scope and to plan your scope carefully.

865
00:53:46,744 --> 00:53:48,985
And then with

866
00:53:49,765 --> 00:53:54,791
when you're developing for both tabletop and digital simultaneously, um, consider how you're

867
00:53:54,791 --> 00:54:00,998
gonna divide the mechanics between the two mediums and be pretty strict about that division.

868
00:54:00,998 --> 00:54:05,583
Um, consider the flexibility of your timing versus the desire for real time interaction.

869
00:54:05,583 --> 00:54:09,007
Um, consider the opacity of the mechanic and how it's used by the players.

870
00:54:09,488 --> 00:54:13,952
Consider the interfacing and like if you want it to be shared

871
00:54:13,952 --> 00:54:16,894
and tactical and do you want to have social elements in this

872
00:54:16,894 --> 00:54:19,936
mechanic, for a given mechanic before you decide which side to

873
00:54:19,936 --> 00:54:24,941
put it on. And finally make each interface with the app worth the

874
00:54:24,941 --> 00:54:26,802
hassle for the players. So that's it. Thank you very much.

875
00:54:39,235 --> 00:54:44,217
Uh, remember to fill out your evaluations, um, and I think I have time for like a question or

876
00:54:44,217 --> 00:54:48,779
two. Oh, yeah, walk up to the mic.

877
00:54:48,779 --> 00:55:03,485
Hey, great job. Um, I just wanted to ask, uh, do you have any thoughts like on specific game

878
00:55:03,485 --> 00:55:08,087
mechanics that could leverage, you know, augmented reality, things like ARKit and ARCore for

879
00:55:08,087 --> 00:55:08,807
tabletop games?

880
00:55:09,695 --> 00:55:14,436
Oh yeah, I mean like AR is something that we've talked about a lot. It could be really cool.

881
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:19,217
One of the things I think we think could be coolest about it is the ability, that kind of

882
00:55:19,217 --> 00:55:24,518
hidden information and overlapping asymmetrical information for different players sitting

883
00:55:24,518 --> 00:55:30,840
around the same table. So AR would allow an overlay of information over a board game so

884
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:36,741
that different players knew different things about what's going on there. And like gave you

885
00:55:36,741 --> 00:55:39,301
that really open interface to the game.

886
00:55:40,022 --> 00:55:44,508
through AR while also maintaining that really strong

887
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:48,474
asymmetry. Obviously this is something, the technology is a

888
00:55:48,474 --> 00:55:51,779
little far out for us to work on it or anything but I think it

889
00:55:51,779 --> 00:55:55,124
could be the potential there is really cool.

890
00:55:55,124 --> 00:55:55,444
Thanks a lot.

891
00:55:59,077 --> 00:56:06,943
I have a question, like you mentioned this interfacing issue between the distance that

892
00:56:06,943 --> 00:56:10,146
was made between the app and the players.

893
00:56:10,146 --> 00:56:19,132
Have you ever thought while developing Mentions of Madness about reading out the text loud,

894
00:56:19,132 --> 00:56:25,797
I mean using any voice over or kind of this kind of possibility to...

895
00:56:26,665 --> 00:56:30,667
make the game better? Yeah, definitely. Oh, I just remembered I'm supposed to repeat the

896
00:56:30,667 --> 00:56:34,629
questions after people say them. I forgot to do that for the first one. Um, yeah, so the

897
00:56:34,629 --> 00:56:40,653
question was, uh, have we considered doing voiceovers or narration? Um, so we originally

898
00:56:40,653 --> 00:56:43,174
had wanted to do narration for nearly all the text.

899
00:56:43,654 --> 00:56:46,778
Obviously, that proved prohibitively expensive.

900
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:52,785
And we talked a bit internally about, like, oh, it would be cool to like Microsoft Sam,

901
00:56:52,785 --> 00:56:53,225
all this text.

902
00:56:53,225 --> 00:56:57,230
But one of the things we're really going for with mansions is the atmosphere.

903
00:56:57,230 --> 00:56:58,972
And at the time, they

904
00:56:59,212 --> 00:57:05,075
there was no real like automated reading of that text that kind of got across a Lovecraftian feel

905
00:57:05,075 --> 00:57:09,698
that we were really happy with. So we opted to just have the players read it at the table.

906
00:57:09,698 --> 00:57:15,521
Also, often players reading the text together at the table can kind of be this bonding and

907
00:57:15,521 --> 00:57:21,224
joking experience that has actually added to the game quite a bit. So we probably have no

908
00:57:21,224 --> 00:57:24,426
intention to put anything like that in the game, I imagine. Thank you.

909
00:57:26,889 --> 00:57:28,150
A great talk.

910
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:30,813
Just wondering, when you were developing the app and the

911
00:57:30,813 --> 00:57:34,596
game, were you considering any sort of accessibility issues,

912
00:57:34,596 --> 00:57:37,879
like in terms of the text and the speed of the text and the

913
00:57:37,879 --> 00:57:39,260
colors and various other things?

914
00:57:39,902 --> 00:57:43,783
Yeah, so accessibility definitely came up.

915
00:57:43,783 --> 00:57:46,084
Oh yeah, so the question was, did we consider accessibility

916
00:57:46,084 --> 00:57:48,545
while developing this app?

917
00:57:48,545 --> 00:57:50,425
And yeah, accessibility definitely came up.

918
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:55,186
It is something that my department in board and card

919
00:57:55,186 --> 00:57:56,527
is very concerned about.

920
00:57:58,664 --> 00:58:05,091
we wanted to help people with. Um we definitely had to make some sacrifices um just to get

921
00:58:05,091 --> 00:58:09,376
the app working. It was something we were pretty inexperienced with um but like app

922
00:58:09,376 --> 00:58:13,641
contrast um scalability and stuff is definitely something we considered during development.

923
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:23,614
Did you look at those old games from the late 70s and early 80s where the technical limitations

924
00:58:23,614 --> 00:58:30,921
were so big, like Odyssey 2 for example, so that you had those board game things too,

925
00:58:30,921 --> 00:58:33,804
to broaden the scope of the video game?

926
00:58:33,804 --> 00:58:36,767
Did you look at those interactions between analog and digital?

927
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:42,194
Yeah, so the question was, did we look at those old games from like the 70s and the 80s that

928
00:58:42,194 --> 00:58:49,439
used kind of the crossover of technology? Yeah, so we, uh, what's the name of that one?

929
00:58:49,439 --> 00:58:56,385
Oh crap, I'm blanking on the name, but we, we, we, huh? Oh yeah, yeah. Um, we, we, we

930
00:58:56,385 --> 00:59:01,629
brought a few into the office, um, and we're playing them. It was, it was, it was a lot of fun.

931
00:59:02,408 --> 00:59:05,910
A couple of them had been sitting in people's basements and didn't really work that well,

932
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:10,213
but we definitely checked out several of those and kind of talked about that.

933
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:21,619
Another kind of inspiration for this kind of game was old school adventure games and

934
00:59:21,619 --> 00:59:24,100
kind of like those FMV mysteries and stuff too.

935
00:59:24,768 --> 00:59:29,352
Alright, cool. So I think that we have to wrap that up there. Um, but if anybody else has

936
00:59:29,352 --> 00:59:33,016
any other questions, I'll be in the wrap up area for a little bit, so feel free to come by and

937
00:59:33,016 --> 00:59:33,996
talk. So thank you everyone.
