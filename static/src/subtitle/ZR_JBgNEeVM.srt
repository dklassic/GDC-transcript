00:00:09,077 --> 00:00:11,900
Hello folks and welcome to GDC 2020 Summer Conference.

2
00:00:12,301 --> 00:00:13,783
This talk is part of the Skill Building Series

3
00:00:13,843 --> 00:00:15,986
and is Pixel Art and Animation in the High Bit Age.

4
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,128
Our host is Tyreek,

5
00:00:17,909 --> 00:00:20,232
noted pixel artist with some sharp looking titles

6
00:00:20,272 --> 00:00:20,773
under his belt.

7
00:00:21,353 --> 00:00:23,636
I am Joel Couture and I will be moderator for this session.

8
00:00:23,837 --> 00:00:24,938
Now Tyreek, here's the floor.

9
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:31,783
Hello, I am Tyreek Plummer.

10
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:32,883
I make games.

11
00:00:34,364 --> 00:00:36,085
I have a few goals for this session

12
00:00:36,145 --> 00:00:38,326
because I have a lot of thoughts and feelings

13
00:00:38,526 --> 00:00:41,767
about pixel art and animation in the hybrid age, which

14
00:00:41,848 --> 00:00:43,448
is why I named the talk that.

15
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:47,572
The first goal is to kind of lay out the role of pixel art in modern games

16
00:00:47,973 --> 00:00:50,135
and define what it means to be in the hybrid age.

17
00:00:50,315 --> 00:00:53,939
The second goal is to provide some examples of contemporary pixel art

18
00:00:54,279 --> 00:00:57,383
that I think are pushing the medium and its aesthetic potential forward.

19
00:00:57,823 --> 00:01:01,587
And the final goal is to give specific technical insight and advice

20
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:04,810
into how to actually make pixel art with a live demonstration.

21
00:01:05,711 --> 00:01:06,132
But first...

22
00:01:06,978 --> 00:01:12,003
Who am I? I'm a game designer and artist who's been making pixel art since I was a wee lad.

23
00:01:12,024 --> 00:01:21,514
I've done pixel art for a number of games, including Thor DS, Epic Mickey, Power of Illusion, Adventure Time, Explore the Dungeon because I don't know.

24
00:01:22,395 --> 00:01:25,657
Most recently, I've done work on Cadence of Hyrule and UFO 50,

25
00:01:26,297 --> 00:01:33,321
and I've also spent a not insignificant portion of my soul working for an unhealthy number of years on my platformer roguelike, Catacomb Kids.

26
00:01:34,381 --> 00:01:39,244
All of this is to say, I really like pixel art, and I think I'm not terrible at it,

27
00:01:39,464 --> 00:01:43,406
which is about the highest praise I'm willing to afford myself, so that's pretty good.

28
00:01:44,727 --> 00:01:47,268
All that being said, what is high-bit art?

29
00:01:49,697 --> 00:01:51,999
Um, oops, I forget to go forward.

30
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:53,902
This is Cadence of Hyrule, a game I worked on.

31
00:01:53,922 --> 00:01:59,648
This is Catacomb Kids, my game, my beloved, precious baby.

32
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:02,011
Um, what is hybrid art?

33
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:07,477
The term was coined by Simon Anderson, also known as Snake, who is an incredibly skilled

34
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:12,944
pixel artist and the creator of Owlboy. He coined the term to describe modern pixel art that has

35
00:02:12,984 --> 00:02:18,511
quote pushed beyond the limitations of the old formats and quote operates beyond the limitations

36
00:02:18,852 --> 00:02:20,414
of the old 8, 16, and 30 bit...

37
00:02:22,356 --> 00:02:23,196
32-bit consoles.

38
00:02:24,497 --> 00:02:26,138
When I tell people I do pixel art,

39
00:02:26,218 --> 00:02:27,659
even people within the games industry,

40
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:28,640
a lot of times they're like,

41
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,522
oh, you mean like 16-bit stuff or like

42
00:02:31,822 --> 00:02:34,184
SNES-type stuff? And increasingly,

43
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,905
these comparisons just don't make

44
00:02:36,005 --> 00:02:37,806
sense anymore because we as pixel

45
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:39,688
artists aren't confined by the hardware

46
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:41,469
limitations of those old systems of

47
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:42,990
16- and 18-bit hardware.

48
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,772
So to say I do that kind of

49
00:02:45,852 --> 00:02:47,673
art would kind of be a lie or a

50
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:48,133
misnomer.

51
00:02:49,886 --> 00:02:53,848
There's a tendency to think that pixel art immediately equates to nostalgia.

52
00:02:54,029 --> 00:02:56,991
And while that is kind of a large part of its appeal to a lot of people,

53
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:02,655
I think that to assume that nostalgia is the primary force behind pixel aesthetics

54
00:03:03,095 --> 00:03:07,258
ignores all the work done by pixel artists in the meantime to push the medium forward

55
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:10,921
in the intervening stretch of time between nostalgia and now.

56
00:03:11,101 --> 00:03:14,764
Like that whole time period existed and pixel artists did too.

57
00:03:15,204 --> 00:03:17,266
And they've been making progress for a long time.

58
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:23,206
The first thing to understand is that pixel art isn't just a style of art, it's a medium.

59
00:03:23,846 --> 00:03:28,451
And like any medium, it can contain and convey a multitude of styles and aesthetics.

60
00:03:28,932 --> 00:03:33,817
And equally importantly, like any medium, pixel art has continued to evolve alongside

61
00:03:33,897 --> 00:03:38,602
newer technologies and tools in the same way that photography didn't make painting obsolete

62
00:03:38,622 --> 00:03:39,763
but shifted its context.

63
00:03:40,784 --> 00:03:44,647
The computing power that has made high resolution

64
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,409
and complex 3D art in games possible

65
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,751
hasn't made pixel art obsolete,

66
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:50,672
but it has shifted its context.

67
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:55,056
So that's the end of the preamble.

68
00:03:55,076 --> 00:03:55,796
With that out of the way,

69
00:03:55,916 --> 00:04:00,120
let's look at some examples of high bit modern art.

70
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,502
And at this point, Joel,

71
00:04:02,522 --> 00:04:05,144
if you have any questions about the particular games

72
00:04:05,184 --> 00:04:07,566
that I'm bringing up, feel free to ask away.

73
00:04:07,586 --> 00:04:09,147
Um, we'll do.

74
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:14,972
So this is Retro City Rampage.

75
00:04:15,493 --> 00:04:18,796
A lot of so even though I know I just said that nostalgia

76
00:04:18,856 --> 00:04:23,300
isn't the primary driving force behind pixel art, it is still a big part of of

77
00:04:24,742 --> 00:04:26,724
what what people find appealing about it.

78
00:04:26,844 --> 00:04:30,247
And some games, some modern games really play into that

79
00:04:31,348 --> 00:04:33,590
that perception, this being one of them.

80
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:35,592
Retro City Rampage.

81
00:04:37,564 --> 00:04:43,047
Yeah, it just looks looks old, kind of emulates the aesthetic of old NES games

82
00:04:43,947 --> 00:04:47,729
to evoke those same feelings of the hardware limitations.

83
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:50,431
I think there's actually even a version of retro city rampage

84
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:52,652
that will run on an NES, but.

85
00:04:54,613 --> 00:05:07,624
That's not to say that it hasn't taken the lessons that pixel artists have learned and the techniques that they've developed since the time of the NES and incorporated them into their aesthetic as well.

86
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:15,470
Always Awakening is another example of a modern retro looking game that uses pixel art.

87
00:05:17,832 --> 00:05:21,175
Very much in the sort of Zelda 2 style looking.

88
00:05:24,952 --> 00:05:27,993
Right. UFO 50, which is a game that I'm working on,

89
00:05:28,553 --> 00:05:32,815
is another game that sort of leans into the the perception of pixel art

90
00:05:32,935 --> 00:05:36,816
as having a retro association and aesthetic to it.

91
00:05:39,577 --> 00:05:43,378
So for UFO 50, we're working with a.

92
00:05:44,598 --> 00:05:47,899
Made up restrictions for an imaginary console, essentially,

93
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,020
but.

94
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:55,334
you know, sometimes we can bend and break those restrictions because we're not actually working

95
00:05:55,495 --> 00:05:57,877
with the hardware, you know, so.

96
00:05:59,303 --> 00:06:03,585
We can we give ourselves a little leeway when it comes to certain aspects of like,

97
00:06:03,765 --> 00:06:08,106
oh, this will just make the game better or make make this more readable or make

98
00:06:08,146 --> 00:06:09,786
this make more sense and that sort of thing.

99
00:06:10,506 --> 00:06:14,567
So there aren't any like like we're roughly following some color color

100
00:06:14,587 --> 00:06:17,728
restrictions and that sort of thing in terms of how many colors per tile we can

101
00:06:17,828 --> 00:06:22,450
use. And we try to keep, you know, sprites.

102
00:06:23,353 --> 00:06:28,456
to a relative minimum because old old hardware had limited sprites per scan

103
00:06:28,496 --> 00:06:30,917
line and that sort of thing, which caused the flickering that that happened.

104
00:06:31,938 --> 00:06:34,099
But we don't really have those limitations.

105
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:35,640
So they're really self enforced.

106
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,782
And if we don't enforce them, then the game just is what it is.

107
00:06:43,044 --> 00:06:44,464
Another is another UFO 50 game.

108
00:06:49,755 --> 00:06:53,499
So beyond the games that sort of lean into the retro aesthetic,

109
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:57,382
I think there are also a number of games that sort of display a virtuosic

110
00:06:58,283 --> 00:07:01,526
nature to pixel art, where it's just really dang good.

111
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:03,447
Just normal pixel art.

112
00:07:03,487 --> 00:07:04,929
Nothing super fancy going on.

113
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:07,611
This is Hartforth, Alicia, Alicia.

114
00:07:08,332 --> 00:07:10,976
One of those currently in development.

115
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:15,223
Another sort of long running development game that makes me feel

116
00:07:15,945 --> 00:07:19,591
more at home with Catacomb Kids, which I've been working on for a very long time.

117
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:24,967
But this is just a really good looking game that just has very good pixel art.

118
00:07:25,087 --> 00:07:29,248
And I think that is another sort of trend of modern pixel art games

119
00:07:29,328 --> 00:07:32,489
is that people have taken the lessons that have been learned over the past

120
00:07:32,609 --> 00:07:36,450
decades of of techniques and

121
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,931
sort of introspection into the medium

122
00:07:39,511 --> 00:07:42,491
and taking them to their natural heights.

123
00:07:45,703 --> 00:07:46,684
More heart for Felicia.

124
00:07:47,304 --> 00:07:48,565
I'm really looking forward to that game.

125
00:07:50,686 --> 00:07:54,648
Iconoclasts would be another example that I would say falls under that category.

126
00:07:54,748 --> 00:07:56,969
It's just it doesn't do a whole lot.

127
00:07:56,989 --> 00:07:58,250
That's extremely fancy.

128
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,791
It's just very good.

129
00:08:00,611 --> 00:08:01,351
And.

130
00:08:02,632 --> 00:08:06,174
You can see that the screen size for this is like significantly larger

131
00:08:06,214 --> 00:08:08,895
than a lot of other pixel art games and the real estate

132
00:08:09,616 --> 00:08:12,397
to match modern displays, so.

133
00:08:13,946 --> 00:08:20,589
That's another trend that's kind of happening to modern pixel art is that the

134
00:08:20,769 --> 00:08:25,291
artists are having to adapt to more modern displays that aren't like, you know,

135
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:30,473
tiny CRTs or very small, like mobile phone screens and that sort of thing.

136
00:08:31,034 --> 00:08:32,814
So we have a lot more real estate to work with.

137
00:08:32,894 --> 00:08:36,276
And sometimes that can be a challenge because we have more real estate to work

138
00:08:36,296 --> 00:08:40,758
with. You have to work harder to make it interesting and fill it up in ways that

139
00:08:40,778 --> 00:08:41,798
are aesthetically pleasing.

140
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:54,067
Owlboy, as mentioned, created by the coiner of the term HiBit,

141
00:08:55,188 --> 00:08:58,330
is another example of just virtuosic pixel art.

142
00:08:59,091 --> 00:08:59,852
Very pretty game.

143
00:09:04,636 --> 00:09:09,339
And then we have things that combine pixel art

144
00:09:09,499 --> 00:09:10,761
with other sort of.

145
00:09:13,271 --> 00:09:17,913
medium. So this is Octopath Traveler, which combines pixel art with,

146
00:09:18,073 --> 00:09:23,415
um, 3d. And you can see it does something like combining pixel art with 3d

147
00:09:23,515 --> 00:09:26,476
isn't super new. That's been a thing since, you know, PlayStation one era.

148
00:09:26,496 --> 00:09:30,858
And I think breath of wild four, uh, had a really good look, look about it.

149
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:33,979
Uh, but you can see this as using a lot more modern techniques,

150
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:38,881
like using the depths of field to blur the background and a lot of like

151
00:09:39,402 --> 00:09:43,924
really soft lighting effects and kind of a vignetting at the edge of the screen.

152
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:48,687
That gives it a really unique look and appearance.

153
00:09:49,828 --> 00:09:53,871
The other textures you can see on the in the environment are still pixeled,

154
00:09:54,851 --> 00:09:55,592
which keeps them,

155
00:09:56,992 --> 00:10:00,114
which keeps everything feeling grounded in the same same sort of style.

156
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:03,877
This is another example, a game in development called Zealot,

157
00:10:04,057 --> 00:10:08,599
which combines pixel art with 3D environments.

158
00:10:10,824 --> 00:10:14,490
And this is a game called The Last Night,

159
00:10:15,392 --> 00:10:16,694
which is also in development.

160
00:10:17,035 --> 00:10:20,961
It looks kind of crazy, but you can definitely see there's there's

161
00:10:21,462 --> 00:10:24,086
pixel pixels happening and.

162
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:30,695
This is kind of a combination of, I think, like virtuosic talent and,

163
00:10:30,915 --> 00:10:35,597
and, and aesthetic with the extremely modern,

164
00:10:35,637 --> 00:10:39,998
like combination combinations of 3d and depth of field and all the lighting

165
00:10:40,018 --> 00:10:43,299
effects and all that sort of thing. I've never really seen anything like this.

166
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:46,440
So I'm curious to see how this actually turns out once it's finished.

167
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:55,845
Um, there's also a game developer named Chloe, uh, also super blizzard on Twitter,

168
00:10:56,066 --> 00:10:58,488
who combines again,

169
00:10:58,989 --> 00:11:02,954
sort of combining the two things of nostalgia and retro aesthetics with,

170
00:11:03,615 --> 00:11:06,798
uh, 3d art. This picture is really tiny. I'm sorry. Hold on.

171
00:11:06,818 --> 00:11:10,322
Let me see if I can make it bigger. There we go. There we go. Um,

172
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:18,379
Uh, so yeah, like combining 3D with these retro aesthetics and keeping everything

173
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,601
quite chunky.

174
00:11:21,442 --> 00:11:23,904
And I think I think this is a really fun, good look.

175
00:11:26,566 --> 00:11:28,267
More work by the same same developer.

176
00:11:33,884 --> 00:11:35,305
Tyreek, if you don't mind me interrupting,

177
00:11:36,686 --> 00:11:40,468
you've shown quite a bit of flexibility with this style for very different things.

178
00:11:41,148 --> 00:11:44,730
What draws you to continually work in pixel art and to use it in some unique ways?

179
00:11:46,871 --> 00:11:47,992
It's a great question.

180
00:11:48,012 --> 00:11:52,054
I find the limitations

181
00:11:52,415 --> 00:11:54,276
of working in low resolution

182
00:11:56,777 --> 00:11:59,519
kind of conducive to creativity.

183
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,500
Working in lower resolutions

184
00:12:04,154 --> 00:12:08,276
like sort of limits my decision space when it comes to certain things, but at the same time,

185
00:12:08,657 --> 00:12:12,619
as you said, there is a lot of flexibility in it. And so I feel like a lot of times I have to come

186
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:19,844
up with creative solutions and creative ways to solve visual problems in pixel art that

187
00:12:21,045 --> 00:12:27,469
in other media, there's a little more leeway. And so those restrictions are kind of

188
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,703
harder, not harder to come by. Like you can always make restrictions for yourself,

189
00:12:32,763 --> 00:12:36,505
but I find that the, the particular restrictions of, of, of pixel art are,

190
00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:41,609
are engaging to me in the way that they're forced you to think about the way you

191
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:46,012
use details and, uh, how to represent, uh,

192
00:12:46,172 --> 00:12:50,395
things in such a small real estate. Um,

193
00:12:51,116 --> 00:12:53,518
and as well, I think that as I'm showing,

194
00:12:53,598 --> 00:12:56,160
like there's still a lot of exploration in the space to be done.

195
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,721
And I want to be a part of that process.

196
00:13:01,476 --> 00:13:05,838
So this is a game still in development called Acid Knife

197
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:08,320
by the developers of Crawl.

198
00:13:10,441 --> 00:13:13,283
And as you can see, it's got a lot going on

199
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,845
in terms of like, there's a lot of like shader effects

200
00:13:15,885 --> 00:13:18,606
that are kind of melting and blending the world around

201
00:13:18,626 --> 00:13:21,668
in the dark sections.

202
00:13:21,728 --> 00:13:23,229
Like that's not video artifacting,

203
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,490
that's just how the game looks.

204
00:13:25,551 --> 00:13:28,272
Which I find really fascinating is the idea of

205
00:13:29,153 --> 00:13:33,075
taking pixel art and then manipulating it after the fact

206
00:13:33,155 --> 00:13:36,016
with these post-processing effects that still

207
00:13:37,377 --> 00:13:42,759
maintain the aesthetic and stay in the style and resolution of these games.

208
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:47,702
But while expanding what's what's possible and beyond what

209
00:13:47,782 --> 00:13:50,863
what, you know, could be normally done by just human hands

210
00:13:51,203 --> 00:13:53,905
working on it on single frames of game and that sort of thing.

211
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,028
Another is still shot of the game.

212
00:13:58,109 --> 00:13:58,849
Radio universe.

213
00:13:59,229 --> 00:14:03,271
Radio of the universe is another sort of game that has a lot of post

214
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:06,473
processing effects and glitchy sort of styling to it.

215
00:14:09,254 --> 00:14:10,414
Also still in development,

216
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:13,036
a lot of these games are still in development, I guess, I just like games

217
00:14:13,056 --> 00:14:14,096
that aren't out yet, but.

218
00:14:16,987 --> 00:14:22,329
Yeah, I think this is a really good example of a game that just takes the pixel

219
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:27,591
aesthetic and sort of twists it and like leans really heavily into it

220
00:14:28,031 --> 00:14:30,752
while still being its own completely unique thing.

221
00:14:30,772 --> 00:14:35,714
You can see it looks like went through like a lot of like Photoshop filters and what have you.

222
00:14:35,734 --> 00:14:42,117
There's some chromatic aberration on the numbers where the RGB channels are kind of slightly separated.

223
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:51,771
A megasphere is, I think, what I would say is another sort of combination of

224
00:14:52,111 --> 00:14:58,812
virtuosic pixel art combined with a lot of like the shader effects and whatnot.

225
00:14:59,912 --> 00:15:04,633
It uses like normal mapping to to use lighting on the actual environment

226
00:15:04,913 --> 00:15:05,813
and characters.

227
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:09,974
And there's a lot of you can see like there's a lot of like glowing lights

228
00:15:10,074 --> 00:15:11,635
that aren't strictly in.

229
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:18,723
in the resolution as the sprites and stuff.

230
00:15:19,523 --> 00:15:23,245
And I think this is one of the few games I've seen that does like resolution

231
00:15:24,046 --> 00:15:27,988
mixing in that way really well in a way that isn't detrimental.

232
00:15:30,569 --> 00:15:35,231
So, yeah, I think it looks kind of kind of wild and really good.

233
00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:42,475
More of it.

234
00:15:45,993 --> 00:15:48,735
Carrion is another game that

235
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:52,238
uses the pixel aesthetic and pixel art,

236
00:15:52,678 --> 00:15:56,441
but combines it with a highly procedurally animated

237
00:15:57,242 --> 00:15:59,684
like main character protagonist.

238
00:15:59,944 --> 00:16:01,105
Kind of hesitant to call it that.

239
00:16:01,445 --> 00:16:05,028
Your big meat blob that goes around killing things and escaping labs

240
00:16:05,068 --> 00:16:05,569
and what have you.

241
00:16:08,011 --> 00:16:13,896
But yeah, you can see like this meat blob is very procedurally animated,

242
00:16:13,936 --> 00:16:17,679
like all the tentacles and such are just kind of whipping and lashing out

243
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,861
in various ways, willy-nilly.

244
00:16:21,502 --> 00:16:26,186
But it's all still within the same sort of lower resolution pixel aesthetic.

245
00:16:29,229 --> 00:16:34,693
And you can also see that the the lighting coming through the windows is is sort of

246
00:16:35,414 --> 00:16:39,116
something that wouldn't have necessarily existed in

247
00:16:40,698 --> 00:16:44,240
older, older hardware and on pixel art games.

248
00:16:46,212 --> 00:16:46,852
a pathway.

249
00:16:47,652 --> 00:16:49,433
Yet another example, I think, of

250
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:54,114
virtuosic mixing with modern technology, technology.

251
00:16:54,654 --> 00:16:58,975
The as far as I understand it, like the this game has like

252
00:16:59,495 --> 00:17:04,817
a whole lighting engine where basically they combine pixel art with voxels.

253
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:09,338
So to to make the the tiles and and and elements in the game

254
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:11,719
have actual volume at volumetric lighting.

255
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:15,461
which is something I've never seen before and is really fascinating to,

256
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:19,402
so like all these walls and characters cast actual shadows because they're

257
00:17:19,482 --> 00:17:23,224
technically voxel bodies that just aren't being drawn and instead are being

258
00:17:23,244 --> 00:17:25,305
drawn as pixel art, uh,

259
00:17:25,385 --> 00:17:28,526
which I think is a really clever solution to that. And, uh,

260
00:17:29,107 --> 00:17:33,308
so that's the end of, that's kind of the end of, of that sort of.

261
00:17:35,545 --> 00:17:39,747
uh, look over existing, existing, um,

262
00:17:40,447 --> 00:17:44,089
games that are, they're doing things. There's a lot more out there. There's,

263
00:17:44,169 --> 00:17:48,170
it's by no means a, uh, all encompassing extensive list.

264
00:17:49,271 --> 00:17:49,371
Um,

265
00:17:51,636 --> 00:17:54,618
And yeah, I just wanted to kind of run through a few of those things

266
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:59,260
before we started getting into the actual practical application

267
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,601
of of the pixels.

268
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:05,683
So any questions about any of that or what's what's up?

269
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,962
We've got some about, what's your favorite software to use for developing high bit modern art?

270
00:18:13,662 --> 00:18:16,484
Ah, fantastic question and an excellent segue.

271
00:18:17,104 --> 00:18:25,248
So, there are a number of programs that exist for pixel art.

272
00:18:26,349 --> 00:18:28,510
My personal favorite is GraphicsGale.

273
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,992
which is free. It used to not be. It used to be 20 bucks.

274
00:18:32,632 --> 00:18:36,574
And I got it when it was, when it wasn't free, but it's free now. Um,

275
00:18:36,934 --> 00:18:42,677
I like it a lot. I've used it for like a decade over a decade,

276
00:18:42,797 --> 00:18:46,519
which is kind of weird to say, um, that I've been doing this for that long.

277
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,041
Uh, but, um,

278
00:18:50,001 --> 00:18:54,684
you can see it right now because this is, if you want to try to go back to my

279
00:18:54,704 --> 00:18:54,904
screen,

280
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:58,569
Um, this is a character that I drew a while ago.

281
00:18:58,589 --> 00:19:02,411
Uh, the giraffe Ian, cause he's a giraffe and a ruffian.

282
00:19:02,471 --> 00:19:02,992
Ha ha ha.

283
00:19:03,032 --> 00:19:03,572
I'm proud of that.

284
00:19:04,293 --> 00:19:07,895
Um, and so I was like, ah, I need something to pixel for this thing stream.

285
00:19:08,536 --> 00:19:11,197
So, uh, for this, this talk rather.

286
00:19:11,878 --> 00:19:17,102
Um, so I chose this guy and I made a little tiny sprite of him and this

287
00:19:17,162 --> 00:19:18,482
is what graphic scale looks like.

288
00:19:18,843 --> 00:19:24,287
Um, there are a lot of other, uh, programs, uh, that exist.

289
00:19:24,767 --> 00:19:24,847
Um,

290
00:19:27,283 --> 00:19:29,645
A Sprite is one of them that I know a lot of people use.

291
00:19:29,986 --> 00:19:31,167
It's a more recent one.

292
00:19:33,749 --> 00:19:36,331
I really like the timeline in a Sprite

293
00:19:36,971 --> 00:19:40,334
for like animating and that sort of thing, it's much more akin to,

294
00:19:40,374 --> 00:19:43,057
I think, like a flash timeline, if you're familiar with that.

295
00:19:44,338 --> 00:19:47,440
And it also lets you like separate multiple

296
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:52,244
different animations without having to have completely separate files for them.

297
00:19:54,173 --> 00:19:55,093
So that's one.

298
00:19:55,593 --> 00:19:58,954
Another one is pixel edit, which I've only used a very little bit of,

299
00:19:59,914 --> 00:20:01,215
but seems really promising.

300
00:20:01,255 --> 00:20:04,596
And I might actually consider transferring to that

301
00:20:05,136 --> 00:20:09,697
if if I put enough work and effort into learning how it works.

302
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:13,358
It has some neat features like being able to move around

303
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:18,540
layers in an animated fashion so that you can like animate a face

304
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,140
and then like have it.

305
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,701
stick to the character.

306
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:24,722
And then if you want to make a change to the face, you'd only have to change one

307
00:20:24,802 --> 00:20:26,483
frame and then it changes on every frame.

308
00:20:27,023 --> 00:20:28,444
It has some really neat features like that.

309
00:20:28,524 --> 00:20:31,545
So pixel edit spelled with a Y P Y X E L.

310
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:36,708
If you're looking for software that might be one to check out.

311
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:40,069
Another one.

312
00:20:41,481 --> 00:20:44,643
ProMotion, I've heard, is one that people use.

313
00:20:44,683 --> 00:20:48,946
I've never personally used it, but I've heard it's decent and good

314
00:20:49,606 --> 00:20:54,029
and has been around for quite a while, similar to how GraphicsGale has.

315
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,791
So, yeah, there's a lot of software out there.

316
00:20:57,111 --> 00:21:00,633
GraphicsGale is the one I use just because it's what I'm most familiar with.

317
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:06,117
Yeah. And I figured if I'm going to be doing this live,

318
00:21:06,597 --> 00:21:09,479
I should use the one, use the program that I'm that I'm quickest in.

319
00:21:11,035 --> 00:21:17,822
So let's do some animating and I can answer some questions if, if, if anybody has them.

320
00:21:17,942 --> 00:21:21,265
Oh, so another more, actually, I have more to say about this.

321
00:21:23,427 --> 00:21:25,048
So I made this, made this draft guy.

322
00:21:25,068 --> 00:21:27,691
Uh, and I was like, Oh yeah, let me just animate this guy.

323
00:21:27,731 --> 00:21:28,892
And then I was like, wait a second.

324
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,013
This is a lot of detail.

325
00:21:30,433 --> 00:21:33,656
I don't know if I can do this in 45 minutes now, around 20.

326
00:21:33,736 --> 00:21:33,896
So, um.

327
00:21:36,567 --> 00:21:39,329
I like simplified the shading and I was like, ah, it's not actually going to help

328
00:21:39,349 --> 00:21:41,490
that much. So we'll see how far I go with this.

329
00:21:43,231 --> 00:21:47,673
But I think one of the one of the important things to understand about pixel

330
00:21:47,713 --> 00:21:51,074
art is that like the lack

331
00:21:51,355 --> 00:21:54,816
and and presence of certain details can really like

332
00:21:56,057 --> 00:21:58,378
make and break a sprite like.

333
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:01,680
As an example, like.

334
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:06,833
If I had like a ball about like that big, let's say it.

335
00:22:06,873 --> 00:22:08,775
Let's say like this is my entire sprite, right?

336
00:22:08,876 --> 00:22:10,558
Like I just got like a little ball this big

337
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:17,767
and I want him to have buttons on his belly, you know, like let's say

338
00:22:17,848 --> 00:22:20,231
let's say this is a little happy face right here.

339
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:25,409
Um, I think like about pixel art is is the, um,

340
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:30,333
the fact that you're working with such small resolutions means that the

341
00:22:31,814 --> 00:22:34,977
units of size are like

342
00:22:35,757 --> 00:22:39,060
significant relative to the to the scale of the entire piece.

343
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,664
So like these these buttons here, if I want him to have like a curved belly,

344
00:22:44,724 --> 00:22:48,567
like these buttons, like a single pixel is all I need to get that impression

345
00:22:48,587 --> 00:22:50,348
across. Right. Um.

346
00:22:51,856 --> 00:22:55,145
And so the same applies for these larger sprites

347
00:22:55,185 --> 00:22:55,747
and that sort of thing.

348
00:22:57,497 --> 00:23:01,339
If I come back, if I come back here, you can see like I this is

349
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,341
supposed to be like a little pocket zipper thing that I just kind of

350
00:23:05,421 --> 00:23:09,104
alternated darker and lighter pixels on to get the zipper effect across.

351
00:23:09,664 --> 00:23:13,486
But if I'm going to have to be working on this and animating it, I don't want to

352
00:23:13,526 --> 00:23:16,048
necessarily have to render that every frame.

353
00:23:16,168 --> 00:23:17,969
So I just simplified it to a single line.

354
00:23:18,569 --> 00:23:22,672
There's a lot of anti aliasing around his edges and that sort of thing that if I'm

355
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,233
going to be rendering is going to take time.

356
00:23:25,553 --> 00:23:28,956
it's not going to actually affect the process of animating it

357
00:23:29,016 --> 00:23:30,718
because animation is

358
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:35,662
like more focused on the actual like present details.

359
00:23:35,682 --> 00:23:37,464
So like if I wanted to make animating him easier,

360
00:23:37,484 --> 00:23:40,346
I would probably get rid of this zipper so that I wouldn't have to have

361
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:43,208
do the secondary animation on that sort of thing flopping around.

362
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:49,074
And like, I wouldn't give him shoelaces because that would be another thing to animate.

363
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:54,381
But I kind of think of animation and rendering as sort of separate processes.

364
00:23:54,441 --> 00:23:58,546
So simplifying this made the rendering process easier,

365
00:23:58,786 --> 00:24:01,689
but the animation process is still going to be roughly,

366
00:24:01,709 --> 00:24:05,654
if I'd say equally as difficult or easy, whatever the case may be.

367
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:15,163
All right. We do have a couple more questions for someone who's just starting to get into making pixel art.

368
00:24:15,243 --> 00:24:19,385
What courses or YouTube channels can you point us at for learning the basics?

369
00:24:21,607 --> 00:24:27,951
So I know Derek, you had a pixel art tutorial for a long time and he just recently updated it.

370
00:24:28,691 --> 00:24:29,912
I would recommend checking that out.

371
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:31,473
It's quite a good tutorial.

372
00:24:32,033 --> 00:24:36,516
There are a lot of good tutorials that exist.

373
00:24:39,215 --> 00:24:45,445
I would also recommend checking out or joining a community,

374
00:24:45,465 --> 00:24:46,907
a Pixlr community.

375
00:24:49,312 --> 00:24:51,654
Uh, pixel joint is, is a good one.

376
00:24:51,954 --> 00:24:57,617
Um, it's quite friendly to, to beginners and it has like a whole like gallery,

377
00:24:57,757 --> 00:25:01,939
gallery section to it that you can, um, check out other people's works on and

378
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,741
post your own work on and get critiques and feedback.

379
00:25:05,021 --> 00:25:09,003
And, uh, pixelation is another one, which is, I think at way of the pixel.net,

380
00:25:09,543 --> 00:25:12,085
or if you just Google pixelation forum, it'll pop up.

381
00:25:12,785 --> 00:25:15,026
Um, I know it's not a YouTube channel.

382
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:15,746
Uh, I don't.

383
00:25:17,727 --> 00:25:20,950
You don't not not super aware of like specific

384
00:25:21,731 --> 00:25:26,215
YouTube channels and video series and that sort of thing that that tutorialize

385
00:25:27,396 --> 00:25:28,397
pixel art as much.

386
00:25:29,378 --> 00:25:33,642
But I found the most valuable thing to be

387
00:25:34,683 --> 00:25:39,167
actually engaging with other pixel artists and.

388
00:25:40,485 --> 00:25:45,052
and getting their feedback and giving them feedback because if you can learn how to critique

389
00:25:45,072 --> 00:25:48,578
something then it'll help you improve yourself by leagues as well.

390
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:54,304
Um, personally, I also, uh, stream, uh, very often.

391
00:25:54,324 --> 00:26:00,308
I have a Twitch stream that I, that I stream on, uh, it's at a four bit Friday,

392
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:07,391
um, on Twitch, um, and I usually do programming stuff, but I also

393
00:26:07,552 --> 00:26:09,993
occasionally will, uh, just do pixel art.

394
00:26:10,153 --> 00:26:13,875
And I'm, uh, quite happy to, if you have.

395
00:26:14,495 --> 00:26:18,279
you know, questions, if you stop by there and I'll, you know,

396
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,121
answer them to the best of my ability.

397
00:26:20,222 --> 00:26:23,365
Or if you have work that you want feedback on, I can do that as well.

398
00:26:24,887 --> 00:26:27,089
Or just hit me up on Twitter at 4 Bit Friday.

399
00:26:27,189 --> 00:26:28,210
I'm 4 Bit Friday everywhere.

400
00:26:31,554 --> 00:26:33,396
Do you use a tablet when creating pixel art?

401
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,852
Yes, I do use a tablet.

402
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:42,336
I used a Wacom Intuos for a while and then it broke after like many years of abuse.

403
00:26:42,837 --> 00:26:46,339
So now I'm currently using a he he he.

404
00:26:46,499 --> 00:26:47,980
Yeah, I don't know how to pronounce it.

405
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,481
It's H-U-I-O-N.

406
00:26:49,721 --> 00:26:52,303
It was way cheaper than Wacom and it works perfectly fine.

407
00:26:55,013 --> 00:27:02,800
Uh, but yes, I do prefer using using tablets for my art in all forms, regardless of whether it's pixel or not.

408
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:07,243
Although sometimes I will switch to mouse if I'm doing like a really tiny sprite.

409
00:27:08,204 --> 00:27:13,769
But even then, I'll usually sketch it out with a tablet before I like go into the nitty gritty details with a mouse.

410
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:18,453
And then sometimes I'll be working with a mouse and I'm like, Why am I using this mouse?

411
00:27:18,613 --> 00:27:19,374
I hate using a mouse.

412
00:27:19,514 --> 00:27:20,435
I'm just going to use a tablet.

413
00:27:24,814 --> 00:27:26,715
Oh boy, this isn't I haven't made any progress.

414
00:27:30,577 --> 00:27:32,558
This is going slowly.

415
00:27:32,578 --> 00:27:33,719
All right.

416
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,080
Let's let's see.

417
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,102
Keep them coming.

418
00:27:40,063 --> 00:27:43,325
Are there any types of techniques you find particularly effective or common in

419
00:27:43,385 --> 00:27:45,307
making good high bit pixel wires?

420
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:47,668
I think.

421
00:27:54,267 --> 00:28:01,578
So I think, um, there are a lot of things that, uh, like in graphics scale

422
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:05,264
specifically that I really liked that, that sort of, uh, streamline my workflow.

423
00:28:06,225 --> 00:28:06,325
Um,

424
00:28:08,663 --> 00:28:12,545
Uh, so for instance, uh, one thing that I really like to do, if I have something

425
00:28:12,585 --> 00:28:15,887
to outline, uh, let me stop this animation again.

426
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:20,750
Um, if I have a blob that I need to need to outline, like, let's say this is, you

427
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:24,293
know, a thing of some sort, let's, yeah, let's make this, let's make this little

428
00:28:24,313 --> 00:28:24,953
happy guy again.

429
00:28:25,153 --> 00:28:25,353
Right.

430
00:28:26,174 --> 00:28:30,036
Um, this guy, he's back.

431
00:28:30,988 --> 00:28:31,589
with his buttons.

432
00:28:32,229 --> 00:28:34,111
Let's say I have to like outline this entire shape.

433
00:28:34,172 --> 00:28:38,136
One thing that I that I find really, really helpful about graphic sales,

434
00:28:38,156 --> 00:28:41,540
it has the color replace tool, which lets me like draw.

435
00:28:45,104 --> 00:28:45,925
Oh, I'm on the wrong layer.

436
00:28:47,167 --> 00:28:48,128
Classic artist problem.

437
00:28:50,757 --> 00:28:55,300
Um, the color replace tool lets me like draw freely without, without,

438
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:59,363
um, but only, only replacing the color that I have selected to, to replace.

439
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:04,307
And what that allows me to do in addition to just recoloring things, if I decide I

440
00:29:04,347 --> 00:29:08,170
don't like the color of it is outline things very easily because I can choose

441
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:11,713
like a large sort of brush size and just go around the edges.

442
00:29:11,733 --> 00:29:11,773
Um.

443
00:29:14,449 --> 00:29:18,453
And that is much faster outlining than having

444
00:29:18,493 --> 00:29:23,016
to place each individual single pixel and that sort of thing.

445
00:29:24,418 --> 00:29:27,060
I'm not sure which other pixel art programs

446
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,383
have the color place tool, but it's probably

447
00:29:30,443 --> 00:29:32,384
one of my most used tools.

448
00:29:34,586 --> 00:29:39,310
Another thing to note might be that if you're

449
00:29:39,671 --> 00:29:39,971
doing.

450
00:29:41,722 --> 00:29:44,165
If you're doing pixel art and you're using it in a game

451
00:29:44,225 --> 00:29:47,729
and it's going to be rotated a lot and that sort of thing,

452
00:29:49,731 --> 00:29:51,553
it's good to note that straight lines,

453
00:29:52,234 --> 00:29:55,697
that is to say lines in one of the four cardinal directions,

454
00:29:56,298 --> 00:30:01,283
rotate much more cleanly than diagonal lines.

455
00:30:02,236 --> 00:30:07,320
So if you're having to rotate any pixel art in a game

456
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,463
and you're keeping it in resolution

457
00:30:10,503 --> 00:30:12,024
and not resolution mixing and that sort of thing,

458
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:16,468
you can see if I have like this diagonal line

459
00:30:17,429 --> 00:30:21,312
and try to rotate it.

460
00:30:24,074 --> 00:30:24,394
There we go.

461
00:30:25,795 --> 00:30:26,715
It gets real nasty.

462
00:30:26,975 --> 00:30:30,456
You see, it gets like if I even if I just rotate it to a cardinal direction,

463
00:30:30,476 --> 00:30:35,157
it gets real, real, real grody and just kind of like all it breaks up

464
00:30:35,237 --> 00:30:35,877
and that sort of thing.

465
00:30:35,957 --> 00:30:38,537
But if you have straight lines,

466
00:30:39,257 --> 00:30:43,018
they tend to keep keep their form a lot better.

467
00:30:43,358 --> 00:30:45,058
Like you can see the the

468
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:51,300
the sides of them aren't like breaking up, even if I make this one one thick.

469
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,900
A single single line thick.

470
00:30:57,256 --> 00:31:01,300
So yeah, I'd say like, keep, keep, keep your, uh,

471
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,505
if you have stuff to rotate, try and keep it cardinal by default, um,

472
00:31:05,705 --> 00:31:07,567
as much as possible. Um,

473
00:31:09,929 --> 00:31:12,913
yeah, that, that, that helps a lot to keep, to keep things looking,

474
00:31:13,033 --> 00:31:15,836
looking much cleaner. Um,

475
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,444
Yeah, there's a lot like that.

476
00:31:20,484 --> 00:31:22,886
That's those sorts of things are the kind of thing that you kind of like

477
00:31:23,426 --> 00:31:25,588
have to pay attention to, especially when you're working in pixel art,

478
00:31:25,668 --> 00:31:29,410
if you want it to look good throughout these like all these transformations

479
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:34,193
and things that are becoming more common in in modern games

480
00:31:34,213 --> 00:31:35,894
that use pixel aesthetics and that sort of thing.

481
00:31:37,976 --> 00:31:39,197
I'm sure I could probably think of more.

482
00:31:39,217 --> 00:31:43,800
I will try to keep thinking of of those sorts of like little details

483
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,301
and mention them if I can remember whenever I can.

484
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:53,818
Alright, when creating a character for a pixel art game, do you normally go straight into

485
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:58,188
creating pixel sprites or do you create your concepts in a different medium and then translate

486
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:58,990
it into pixel art?

487
00:31:59,922 --> 00:32:04,363
It depends on the game and the style

488
00:32:06,103 --> 00:32:09,184
for larger sprites like and in higher resolutions,

489
00:32:09,284 --> 00:32:14,605
I'll usually try to do a larger, higher resolution concept beforehand.

490
00:32:15,065 --> 00:32:18,446
For smaller sprites, I will usually just jump straight into

491
00:32:19,566 --> 00:32:21,406
straight into doing it as as pixel art.

492
00:32:23,967 --> 00:32:25,607
Yeah, that's about it.

493
00:32:27,315 --> 00:32:29,396
And also, usually, more often than not,

494
00:32:29,436 --> 00:32:32,658
I will just jump straight into the pixel art aspect of it

495
00:32:33,578 --> 00:32:35,379
before concepting anything else.

496
00:32:35,439 --> 00:32:37,400
And if I'm struggling with it, then I

497
00:32:37,441 --> 00:32:39,602
might go back to the concept phase and be like,

498
00:32:39,702 --> 00:32:42,744
oh, this needs work and solving.

499
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,028
All right, another question.

500
00:32:50,188 --> 00:32:52,749
What dartboard size do you use slash how do you

501
00:32:53,049 --> 00:32:54,350
know how to scale properly?

502
00:32:55,277 --> 00:32:56,658
What what board size?

503
00:32:57,659 --> 00:32:59,841
It says dartboard dartboard.

504
00:33:00,481 --> 00:33:01,262
Do they mean artboard?

505
00:33:01,862 --> 00:33:02,403
Probably. OK.

506
00:33:06,572 --> 00:33:09,095
Again, so this is something that comes down to,

507
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,217
is this going to be on a game by game basis?

508
00:33:11,337 --> 00:33:16,141
I'm hesitant to like just make generalizations about like what's good

509
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,983
and what's bad and what's best and all that sort of thing,

510
00:33:18,323 --> 00:33:21,266
because it's going to vary so much from game to game

511
00:33:22,047 --> 00:33:23,808
and from from project to project.

512
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:26,370
I kind of.

513
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:31,652
oscillate between enjoying working in really large sizes,

514
00:33:32,172 --> 00:33:35,934
like relative to pixel art, like 128 by 128, 96 by 96.

515
00:33:36,034 --> 00:33:39,876
I really liked those sizes. Um, and, uh, really, uh,

516
00:33:40,376 --> 00:33:44,198
really tiny, like 16 by 16, uh, eight by eight.

517
00:33:44,258 --> 00:33:47,619
It's kind of annoying, but, but, uh, I, I,

518
00:33:47,719 --> 00:33:51,882
I oscillate between enjoying like working in the various sizes cause they offer

519
00:33:51,922 --> 00:33:54,323
different, uh, challenges and different, um,

520
00:33:57,495 --> 00:34:05,140
opportunities and sort of just senses of finality

521
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,801
and of what the finished thing is going to be.

522
00:34:07,401 --> 00:34:10,603
They're both fun.

523
00:34:13,085 --> 00:34:13,245
Yeah.

524
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:21,472
Alright, here's one. I have a question not related to the games themselves.

525
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:26,356
What are your thoughts on pixel art content in the corporate slash commercial space through

526
00:34:26,416 --> 00:34:31,160
brand activation combined with IP? Wow, that's a fun question.

527
00:34:33,024 --> 00:34:38,588
repeat that. Sure alright. What are your thoughts on pixel art

528
00:34:38,628 --> 00:34:41,550
content in the corporate slash commercial space through brand

529
00:34:41,651 --> 00:34:44,613
activation combined with IP? I think I see what you're saying

530
00:34:44,653 --> 00:34:48,155
so like like in terms of pixel art used outside of the context

531
00:34:48,315 --> 00:34:51,598
of games as just like an aesthetic for advertising that

532
00:34:51,618 --> 00:34:53,359
sort of thing. I assume that's what you're talking about.

533
00:34:56,487 --> 00:34:57,607
I mean, it's fine.

534
00:34:58,068 --> 00:35:02,730
It's like I said, pixel art isn't necessarily a style.

535
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:04,991
It's a medium and it's a valid medium

536
00:35:05,091 --> 00:35:07,913
for advertising your stuff if you wanna.

537
00:35:08,834 --> 00:35:11,995
I actually was hired a few years ago to...

538
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:18,031
This is kind of annoying, actually.

539
00:35:18,051 --> 00:35:22,433
I was hired a few years ago to not work on a game, but to work on a credit card

540
00:35:22,993 --> 00:35:25,915
like they wanted to design for their credit card that was pixel art.

541
00:35:26,495 --> 00:35:31,298
And I made a piece that I thought was really good and fun and, you know, charming.

542
00:35:32,858 --> 00:35:37,041
And they hated it and made me make some really just banal, boring.

543
00:35:38,204 --> 00:35:41,266
nonsense that I absolutely hated working on.

544
00:35:41,787 --> 00:35:46,431
So in that sense, I'm not a huge fan of those sorts of things,

545
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:49,634
but they did pay me eventually.

546
00:35:49,654 --> 00:35:52,056
I had to hound them for a while, but

547
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,639
that's that's not a great story. I'm sorry. But.

548
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,402
So in that sense, like I didn't like working with that particular company,

549
00:36:00,462 --> 00:36:05,305
but like if you want to advertise your stuff in whatever style like that's fine.

550
00:36:05,565 --> 00:36:08,407
I don't I'm not going to tell you to stop or whatever.

551
00:36:11,148 --> 00:36:11,889
But I wouldn't do it again.

552
00:36:15,937 --> 00:36:19,739
I feel like that's I feel like the nature of that experience is probably more

553
00:36:19,799 --> 00:36:24,641
indicative of just being an artist in corporate culture as opposed to

554
00:36:24,801 --> 00:36:29,303
necessarily being a pixel artist in that particular, you know,

555
00:36:29,403 --> 00:36:32,665
in, in, in any kind of corporate culture and that sort of thing.

556
00:36:32,685 --> 00:36:42,169
All right. How does working at pixel art differ from other visual mediums?

557
00:36:43,649 --> 00:36:43,689
Um,

558
00:36:46,238 --> 00:36:48,200
Well, I think there's a

559
00:36:49,121 --> 00:36:53,204
there's some misconceptions about pixel art that it's easier,

560
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:57,888
specifically from gamers, I think, not necessarily from other game developers.

561
00:36:57,928 --> 00:36:59,469
But I see a lot of times like, you know,

562
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:04,433
sometimes like gamers will be like, Oh, this game is pixel art.

563
00:37:04,673 --> 00:37:07,195
This cheap, they didn't have a budget for like real art or whatever.

564
00:37:07,235 --> 00:37:08,376
And I'm like, I forget you.

565
00:37:09,937 --> 00:37:10,918
That's not the case at all.

566
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:14,179
Like pixel art is not easier or cheaper necessarily than any other type of art.

567
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:18,041
It's can sometimes be quite a lot more time

568
00:37:18,061 --> 00:37:20,082
consuming than just drawing something at high resolution.

569
00:37:25,617 --> 00:37:28,761
But also a lot of times people ask me, like, like, oh, how do you do shading or

570
00:37:28,801 --> 00:37:31,323
how do you do, how do you pick colors and pixel art and that sort of thing?

571
00:37:31,544 --> 00:37:36,349
And that's always been kind of a strange question to me because it's like you

572
00:37:36,749 --> 00:37:40,733
shade like you would anything like it's just shading, like light, the way light

573
00:37:40,773 --> 00:37:43,236
works doesn't change when you move into pixel art suddenly.

574
00:37:45,593 --> 00:37:49,277
and the way color theory and, and, and, you know,

575
00:37:49,337 --> 00:37:52,380
composition and that sort of thing doesn't suddenly change, uh,

576
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,043
when you move into pixel art. So a lot of there's,

577
00:37:55,383 --> 00:37:56,545
there are a lot of differences,

578
00:37:56,585 --> 00:38:00,188
but there are also a lot of similarities and overlap. And I feel like a lot of,

579
00:38:00,789 --> 00:38:01,370
what, uh,

580
00:38:02,297 --> 00:38:07,439
what makes pixel art sort of special and specific is the fact that,

581
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:10,800
like I was showing with the buttons earlier and like, like on,

582
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:13,341
especially this is a bad example because this sprite is right.

583
00:38:13,361 --> 00:38:15,782
It's so large, but especially on smaller sprites, um,

584
00:38:17,422 --> 00:38:19,763
the, um,

585
00:38:22,064 --> 00:38:24,864
a single pixel can make such a huge difference. Um,

586
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:28,411
And that's like just a single decision you can make.

587
00:38:28,591 --> 00:38:32,794
And I feel like a lot of a lot of other art media

588
00:38:32,814 --> 00:38:36,597
don't really have that kind of just strict binary of like,

589
00:38:36,817 --> 00:38:41,780
here's a single decision I can make that changes one single pixel in this picture

590
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:45,002
and completely changes the meaning of the entire thing.

591
00:38:46,843 --> 00:38:50,806
I feel like that's kind of what the core of pixel art comes down to

592
00:38:51,967 --> 00:38:54,609
is just like having those sorts of moments where it's like, oh,

593
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:59,084
I'm going to put this pixel here, and it's

594
00:38:59,124 --> 00:39:02,808
going to mean this whole slew of things

595
00:39:03,028 --> 00:39:03,969
for the rest of the image.

596
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:10,655
And I think another sort of thing about pixel art

597
00:39:10,775 --> 00:39:15,039
is that it can be used to abstract.

598
00:39:17,967 --> 00:39:21,550
Um, so like a lot of if you think of like a lot of like the older games

599
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:24,293
that use pixel art and that sort of thing, like especially in NES

600
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:28,176
and those sorts of things, a lot of the character designs,

601
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:31,620
the iconic character designs are were like.

602
00:39:32,574 --> 00:39:35,975
in sprite form, just like super abstract and like, is that a nose?

603
00:39:36,075 --> 00:39:37,615
Is that a mustache? That sort of thing.

604
00:39:39,215 --> 00:39:43,016
That's something that I feel like, you know, can still be leveraged

605
00:39:43,196 --> 00:39:49,158
in art today and leaving things up to the player or viewer's mind

606
00:39:50,478 --> 00:39:53,739
of just like, I don't know what I'm looking at, so I'm just going to fill in

607
00:39:53,759 --> 00:39:57,559
the blanks and probably whatever I think of is maybe going to end up

608
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:58,540
being a lot cooler than.

609
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:03,759
whatever was intended, maybe not what was intended, but like what, what,

610
00:40:03,939 --> 00:40:08,803
what the artists could have executed on their particular timeframe and

611
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,744
budget and that sort of thing. Uh,

612
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:11,945
which I think is a pretty,

613
00:40:11,965 --> 00:40:16,108
pretty fun thing to play around with is mess like playing around with those

614
00:40:16,209 --> 00:40:18,250
spaces of abstraction and, uh,

615
00:40:19,171 --> 00:40:23,855
deliberately making certain details kind of obtuse so that people

616
00:40:23,935 --> 00:40:27,738
don't really know what exactly they're looking at and can fill in the blanks

617
00:40:27,998 --> 00:40:28,438
themselves.

618
00:40:33,123 --> 00:40:34,363
All right, next question.

619
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:36,144
How do I make my pixel art look good

620
00:40:36,164 --> 00:40:37,764
if I am not otherwise an artist?

621
00:40:39,185 --> 00:40:40,065
Practice.

622
00:40:41,445 --> 00:40:46,467
It's the same answer as any kind of art or endeavor

623
00:40:46,507 --> 00:40:47,307
that you want to be good at.

624
00:40:47,887 --> 00:40:48,847
I will say though,

625
00:40:50,928 --> 00:40:52,708
and this goes for not just pixel art,

626
00:40:52,728 --> 00:40:53,949
but for all art in general,

627
00:40:54,049 --> 00:40:54,769
I feel like

628
00:40:59,302 --> 00:41:00,443
How do I how do I phrase this?

629
00:41:00,803 --> 00:41:04,165
I feel like you can get away with a lot as long as you're consistent.

630
00:41:05,285 --> 00:41:07,587
And that's why that's.

631
00:41:11,449 --> 00:41:14,470
Like. A game

632
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:18,713
with art that is bad

633
00:41:19,673 --> 00:41:21,974
in all the same way,

634
00:41:23,015 --> 00:41:27,137
I think is visually compelling.

635
00:41:28,334 --> 00:41:33,319
as compared to a game with art that is sometimes bad and sometimes good,

636
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,001
because to me,

637
00:41:35,021 --> 00:41:38,785
to me, it kind of comes down to like a sense of intentionality.

638
00:41:40,588 --> 00:41:41,749
And I feel like if.

639
00:41:42,714 --> 00:41:45,597
Art is, you know, mostly good, but then sometimes bad.

640
00:41:45,677 --> 00:41:48,840
The bad art is going to feel really unintentional

641
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,443
and it's going to make the whole thing feel worse to me.

642
00:41:52,463 --> 00:41:54,425
This is just my personal feelings.

643
00:41:55,466 --> 00:41:58,568
But if everything is equally bad, then it's going to be like,

644
00:41:58,708 --> 00:41:59,729
oh, they knew what they were doing.

645
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:03,233
You know, they meant to do all this stuff wrong.

646
00:42:03,553 --> 00:42:04,894
Sorry, that didn't answer the question at all.

647
00:42:04,914 --> 00:42:07,476
The answer to the question is practice and

648
00:42:09,508 --> 00:42:12,310
Do it, do it, do it a lot, make, make a bunch of stuff, study,

649
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:14,811
study art that you like, pixel art that you like.

650
00:42:16,091 --> 00:42:21,093
Looking examples of of of games that you that you like

651
00:42:21,193 --> 00:42:25,375
would like to approach the style and quality of and see what they do

652
00:42:25,475 --> 00:42:26,096
and how they do it.

653
00:42:27,756 --> 00:42:31,958
It's the like I said, it's the same the same set of steps

654
00:42:32,058 --> 00:42:35,340
for learning any kind of art or craft is.

655
00:42:36,833 --> 00:42:39,036
Just practice and practice and study it.

656
00:42:39,076 --> 00:42:39,276
Yeah.

657
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,361
Here's possibly a lighter one.

658
00:42:44,581 --> 00:42:45,943
Do you ever dream in pixels?

659
00:42:49,526 --> 00:42:50,708
I don't know that I dream in

660
00:42:51,889 --> 00:42:54,752
pixels necessarily, but I've definitely dreamed

661
00:42:56,033 --> 00:42:59,036
in games that were pixeled.

662
00:43:00,682 --> 00:43:04,663
Um, like I've never, I've never had a dream that was like, uh, oh, I'm going

663
00:43:04,683 --> 00:43:07,384
through like a real life situation now, but everything's pixel art.

664
00:43:07,984 --> 00:43:09,604
It's always been like, oh, I'm dreaming.

665
00:43:09,644 --> 00:43:10,905
I'm in this really cool game.

666
00:43:11,345 --> 00:43:15,546
And I dreamt, I dreamt once that I made the best game in the world and it got put

667
00:43:15,586 --> 00:43:17,667
in a museum and it was really amazing.

668
00:43:17,727 --> 00:43:19,868
And then I woke up and couldn't remember what the game was.

669
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:21,288
And I was really sad about that one.

670
00:43:22,128 --> 00:43:22,188
Uh,

671
00:43:27,407 --> 00:43:29,548
Yeah. All right.

672
00:43:29,608 --> 00:43:30,329
Another question.

673
00:43:30,469 --> 00:43:33,051
When hiring a pixel artist, what should we expect to pay?

674
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,536
Personally, I tend to charge

675
00:43:39,736 --> 00:43:42,959
between 40 and 50 dollars an hour

676
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,802
for. Pixel art stuff.

677
00:43:49,169 --> 00:43:53,271
that's just sort of like my baseline and any like compensation

678
00:43:53,712 --> 00:43:55,172
that I do that's below that.

679
00:43:55,252 --> 00:43:59,194
I try to make sure it's of at least that value. Um,

680
00:43:59,475 --> 00:44:02,556
it depends on the artists though. Uh, I know some, some,

681
00:44:03,116 --> 00:44:05,138
some artists who will charge like 60 an hour. Uh,

682
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:10,020
I know a lot of artists who greatly undercharge, um,

683
00:44:11,301 --> 00:44:16,063
and that's not cool. Uh, so yeah,

684
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:17,964
I would say like, just try and try and,

685
00:44:19,187 --> 00:44:20,187
Compensate them fairly.

686
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:25,208
Like I said, I usually try and be around 40 to 50 an hour, which is honestly

687
00:44:25,268 --> 00:44:32,069
probably a little low, lower than I should be, but it's, uh, it's, it's, it's,

688
00:44:32,609 --> 00:44:33,209
it's where I'm at.

689
00:44:33,369 --> 00:44:37,170
I, I'll probably ask for more eventually, but I'll, I'll get there.

690
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:39,210
Um, yeah.

691
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:43,071
All right.

692
00:44:43,231 --> 00:44:45,092
I believe we have time for one more.

693
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,520
I didn't get anywhere with this guy, man.

694
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,380
I'm sorry about that.

695
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:51,361
I was I was I was having such high, high expectations of myself.

696
00:44:51,421 --> 00:44:52,962
I was like, oh, yeah, I'm going to have like a whole

697
00:44:53,502 --> 00:44:56,243
rough of this guy's swing and follow through and everything.

698
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:57,583
And it's just not happening.

699
00:44:58,243 --> 00:44:59,183
He's still winding up.

700
00:45:02,044 --> 00:45:05,065
All right, well, let's see, we can squeeze the last one in.

701
00:45:05,505 --> 00:45:05,885
Yeah.

702
00:45:06,065 --> 00:45:08,686
What kinds of games might benefit most from a pixel aesthetic?

703
00:45:10,786 --> 00:45:15,788
Um, well, obviously there's, uh, as I mentioned, kind of a nostalgia factor.

704
00:45:15,988 --> 00:45:20,389
So like, if you want to play into that, then you can definitely, uh, use that.

705
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:21,030
And.

706
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:22,530
And that sort of thing.

707
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:28,652
Um, but I feel like a lot of younger people never really experienced the era of

708
00:45:28,872 --> 00:45:32,174
gaming when pixel art was a necessary hardware restriction.

709
00:45:32,194 --> 00:45:35,795
Uh, so they have kind of a different context for, uh.

710
00:45:38,131 --> 00:45:40,312
for the for their, you know, their.

711
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:42,994
Their experience of pixel art,

712
00:45:44,515 --> 00:45:47,057
which is maybe more akin to like, you know, kids,

713
00:45:47,917 --> 00:45:50,439
you know, liking really liking music from the 80s and that sort of thing

714
00:45:50,459 --> 00:45:53,581
when they were like or like like synth wave and that sort of thing,

715
00:45:54,021 --> 00:45:59,745
or it's like 80s aesthetic, but sort of completely disconnected

716
00:45:59,845 --> 00:46:03,047
from from the experienced

717
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:05,008
time frame.

718
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,421
So like you can you can.

719
00:46:11,943 --> 00:46:13,184
Play into that and that sort of thing.

720
00:46:14,245 --> 00:46:18,729
But even even even aside from, you know, the whole historical aspect

721
00:46:18,769 --> 00:46:23,273
of pixel art and its place in, you know, gaming, gaming aesthetic,

722
00:46:24,594 --> 00:46:29,298
I think pixel art can be used to communicate things about the game itself,

723
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:34,102
like you might be able to use pixel art to communicate like, oh, some

724
00:46:34,963 --> 00:46:35,464
this game is.

725
00:46:38,315 --> 00:46:40,275
kind of a purity of design, I think,

726
00:46:40,636 --> 00:46:42,496
can be communicated via pixel art,

727
00:46:42,516 --> 00:46:45,217
where like you look at, you know, some 3D game

728
00:46:45,517 --> 00:46:47,158
and you're like, oh, I don't really know how to play that.

729
00:46:47,178 --> 00:46:49,259
It looks fun, but I don't know what's happening necessarily.

730
00:46:49,299 --> 00:46:50,859
But I feel like sometimes you can look at like

731
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,360
a pixel art game and be like,

732
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:54,761
I can kind of tell what's going on here.

733
00:46:54,781 --> 00:46:57,362
You know, it, it, it's, I think the,

734
00:46:57,462 --> 00:47:01,484
the nature of pixel art and the way it sort of enforces a,

735
00:47:01,504 --> 00:47:05,886
a simplification of design and, uh, and, and, uh,

736
00:47:06,106 --> 00:47:09,867
visual elements also tends to lend itself well to, uh,

737
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:14,930
being quickly readable, uh, and, and, and, um,

738
00:47:16,394 --> 00:47:21,581
And especially if you if you use the because Pixel has like the sort of built

739
00:47:21,661 --> 00:47:26,348
in visual language of the entire history of video games in it.

740
00:47:26,568 --> 00:47:29,512
Like, you know, like if you see like a photorealistic

741
00:47:30,934 --> 00:47:32,096
3D game, then you're.

742
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:37,239
your comparisons might be closer to like, oh, this looks kind of like a movie.

743
00:47:37,279 --> 00:47:40,621
But if you see a pixel art image of anything,

744
00:47:40,681 --> 00:47:44,343
you're going to have the association with video games and you can leverage that to

745
00:47:44,703 --> 00:47:46,504
communicate certain video game

746
00:47:47,685 --> 00:47:51,087
tropes and language in terms of like, oh, this is a platformer.

747
00:47:51,307 --> 00:47:54,028
This is, you know, shoot him up and that sort of thing.

748
00:47:56,118 --> 00:47:59,100
So, yeah, I think that that's kind of a way to use the you that you can maybe use

749
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:03,102
pixel art if you're not explicitly tapping into the

750
00:48:03,602 --> 00:48:07,985
like remembered history of of of the style

751
00:48:08,265 --> 00:48:09,486
of the medium and that sort of thing.

752
00:48:11,387 --> 00:48:13,288
Yeah, maybe that.

753
00:48:13,308 --> 00:48:19,032
All right, take with that, we're out of time.

754
00:48:19,052 --> 00:48:22,414
OK, I got I got two and a half frames done.

755
00:48:22,434 --> 00:48:24,755
Nope, not even done.

756
00:48:26,649 --> 00:48:26,929
Thanks.

757
00:48:31,653 --> 00:48:31,833
All right.

758
00:48:31,853 --> 00:48:32,953
Thank you all for coming out.

759
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:37,276
Again, this is Tyreek Plummer, and thanks again for attending.
