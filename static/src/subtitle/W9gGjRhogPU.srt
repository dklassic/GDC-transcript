1
00:00:01,461 --> 00:00:07,483
So thanks for coming out to Influences, y'all.

2
00:00:07,483 --> 00:00:09,985
We appreciate you coming.

3
00:00:09,985 --> 00:00:10,725
I'm John Sharp.

4
00:00:10,725 --> 00:00:12,386
I'm Colleen Macklin.

5
00:00:12,386 --> 00:00:15,967
And Colleen is sitting in a chair not because she is lazy,

6
00:00:15,967 --> 00:00:17,608
but rather she has a broken foot.

7
00:00:17,608 --> 00:00:21,770
When somebody says, like, break a leg at your panel,

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,051
you can just literally do it.

9
00:00:23,051 --> 00:00:23,771
She did it.

10
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:28,982
So Colleen and I collaborate a lot together on things like

11
00:00:28,982 --> 00:00:29,943
conference sessions.

12
00:00:29,943 --> 00:00:31,564
We're part of a company, Local Number 12, with

13
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:33,365
Eric Zimmerman.

14
00:00:33,365 --> 00:00:37,088
Our game, MetaGame, it's on Kickstarter right now.

15
00:00:37,088 --> 00:00:39,429
We'd appreciate support.

16
00:00:39,429 --> 00:00:42,892
We're also faculty at Parsons, the new school for design.

17
00:00:42,892 --> 00:00:47,775
We teach games inside a program that is very much not

18
00:00:47,775 --> 00:00:49,076
about games.

19
00:00:49,076 --> 00:00:53,479
Perhaps that leads us to why we would do a

20
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:54,660
session like this.

21
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:58,678
Yeah. So, up until now,

22
00:00:58,678 --> 00:01:03,280
most of this conference has been about games. We focused our conversations on

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,881
games, how we make them,

24
00:01:04,881 --> 00:01:08,784
what we're playing, how to get people to know about them,

25
00:01:08,784 --> 00:01:12,046
how to sustain ourselves and our companies, how to monetize

26
00:01:12,046 --> 00:01:14,267
free-to-play, how to monetize and free-to-play.

27
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,261
et cetera, et cetera.

28
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:20,882
But we forget that games are part of a much larger universe.

29
00:01:20,882 --> 00:01:25,844
We have done extensive research in our roles as faculty,

30
00:01:25,844 --> 00:01:30,985
and we have identified exactly where games are in the galaxy.

31
00:01:30,985 --> 00:01:35,007
So that's the primary takeaway, I think, from this talk.

32
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:35,967
Thank you very much.

33
00:01:35,967 --> 00:01:39,288
But what about all the other things

34
00:01:39,288 --> 00:01:41,469
we can learn from and be inspired by,

35
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:44,250
like film, music, spelunking?

36
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:49,873
for example. So this is a session

37
00:01:49,873 --> 00:01:53,857
about everything but games that influences

38
00:01:53,857 --> 00:01:57,421
the work of a group of four game developers.

39
00:01:57,421 --> 00:02:01,465
Colleen and I also draw from many things outside of games.

40
00:02:02,783 --> 00:02:05,506
I, for some reason, have a PhD in art history.

41
00:02:05,506 --> 00:02:08,048
One of the things that I learned from,

42
00:02:08,048 --> 00:02:10,611
one of the artists I learned from is Giotto,

43
00:02:10,611 --> 00:02:12,492
14th century Italian painter.

44
00:02:12,492 --> 00:02:16,216
And from him, I learned the power of minimalism

45
00:02:16,216 --> 00:02:17,597
and of focus.

46
00:02:17,597 --> 00:02:21,280
How can you distill things down to their minimal essence

47
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,022
to intensify an experience?

48
00:02:23,022 --> 00:02:26,425
How can you remove and prune and refine

49
00:02:26,425 --> 00:02:29,067
to get down to where you can really enhance?

50
00:02:29,922 --> 00:02:33,684
and draw attention exactly where you want it to be.

51
00:02:33,684 --> 00:02:37,967
So while John was getting his PhD, I was hanging out in raves.

52
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:41,529
I have my foundation, my doctorate in rave culture

53
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:47,432
in New York City. So as a... I was a VJ. I would DJ sometimes too, but in New York

54
00:02:47,432 --> 00:02:48,053
City

55
00:02:48,053 --> 00:02:52,535
there was weekly iteration of coding. I was doing a lot of coding, learning how

56
00:02:52,535 --> 00:02:54,356
to make things interactive. So

57
00:02:54,356 --> 00:02:55,937
for the people who didn't want to dance...

58
00:02:56,618 --> 00:02:59,139
they could play with the visuals or change the environment.

59
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:03,161
We were part of a learning community. We shared a lot of knowledge.

60
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:07,244
And I feel like there's a real parallel to this scene in the 90s

61
00:03:07,244 --> 00:03:10,506
to where we are today in sharing knowledge as a game design community.

62
00:03:10,506 --> 00:03:14,528
For me, Samuel Beckett and this quote,

63
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:19,330
ever tried, ever failed, no matter, try again, fail again, fail better.

64
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,332
I literally have it tattooed on my chest.

65
00:03:23,045 --> 00:03:27,666
For me, it's meant a lot, personally and professionally, that it's okay to fail.

66
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,147
It's a huge part of what we do as game designers, right?

67
00:03:30,147 --> 00:03:36,069
Any of us who subscribe to a play-centric way of making our games, we live by this every day.

68
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:38,630
This is the mantra for me.

69
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:42,412
Helps you remember that failure is essential, and without it, I'll never be better.

70
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:47,280
John might show you that tattoo later if you ask him.

71
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,167
So I also currently I'm really influenced by

72
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:56,035
by writing and by different authors. These are some quotes from George Saunders

73
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:56,195
who...

74
00:03:56,885 --> 00:04:02,268
I would kind of call a David Foster Wallace with soul.

75
00:04:02,268 --> 00:04:04,790
So he's incredible, his writing makes me

76
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:09,193
feel so many different things, but I think a lot of it's about surrealism and

77
00:04:09,193 --> 00:04:10,594
random perceptual

78
00:04:10,594 --> 00:04:14,196
connections that illuminate how weird it is to be a human.

79
00:04:15,217 --> 00:04:20,061
And also he talks a lot about death and deals a lot with mortality.

80
00:04:20,061 --> 00:04:31,430
So I think there is some relationship to human fallibility, failure, and his writings that as designers of failure, as game designers, we can learn a lot from.

81
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:44,180
So yeah, there's lots and lots of ways for us to be influenced by things outside of games, to enhance our games, to make them better, to make us better practitioners of whatever part of game development.

82
00:04:44,628 --> 00:04:50,157
we happen to be involved in. We've got four awesome people here today that have agreed

83
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:56,266
to share some of their external influences. Richard LaMarchion, Kelly Santiago, Ben Esposito,

84
00:04:56,266 --> 00:04:57,247
and Brenda Romero.

85
00:04:59,557 --> 00:05:02,898
we've got Richard Lemarchand. Come on up, Rich.

86
00:05:02,898 --> 00:05:07,559
So Rich is probably best known for his work on the Uncharted series.

87
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:11,760
More recently he has joined the ranks of the professors

88
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,741
at the University of Southern California in their interactive media and games

89
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:15,581
program.

90
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:18,882
He's also a DJ. You've got a little rave in you, Richard.

91
00:05:18,882 --> 00:05:22,483
He's been found spinning at

92
00:05:22,483 --> 00:05:26,845
several different game-oriented parties under names like DJ Philippe Lemarchand.

93
00:05:27,205 --> 00:05:30,027
and DJ Cerberus, of which we're part of,

94
00:05:30,027 --> 00:05:31,308
the three-headed beast.

95
00:05:31,308 --> 00:05:32,409
My fellow DJs.

96
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:33,930
Take it away, Rich.

97
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,371
Thanks, Colleen.

98
00:05:35,371 --> 00:05:39,794
And thank you for that lovely introduction.

99
00:05:39,794 --> 00:05:43,096
It's a real honor to be on a panel like this today

100
00:05:43,096 --> 00:05:45,378
among such esteemed company.

101
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:48,220
It says in the program that I was going to talk about

102
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,480
Georgians and Victorians, but I'll

103
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,463
have to tell you about my heroes, Mary Wollstonecraft

104
00:05:52,463 --> 00:05:53,683
and William Morris another time.

105
00:05:53,683 --> 00:05:54,904
I decided to narrow my focus.

106
00:05:55,885 --> 00:05:58,506
Because I'm very interested in realism in video games.

107
00:05:58,506 --> 00:06:05,050
Now for what I want to talk about today, I don't mean realism in the sense of improved physics or better lighting,

108
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,912
though I am very interested in those things too.

109
00:06:07,912 --> 00:06:12,195
Today I mean realism in the sense of the realist artistic movements,

110
00:06:12,195 --> 00:06:14,556
in painting, literary fiction and film,

111
00:06:14,556 --> 00:06:19,599
which emerged in the middle of the 19th century and which have been present in the arts ever since.

112
00:06:21,198 --> 00:06:25,740
The original goal of realism was to show what life is like for ordinary people

113
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,121
without any kind of romantic idealization or

114
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:32,243
sentimentality or over-dramatization.

115
00:06:32,243 --> 00:06:35,424
Of course, for hundreds of years, most of the pictures that got painted

116
00:06:35,424 --> 00:06:39,186
were portraits of kings and popes, the ruling classes.

117
00:06:39,186 --> 00:06:41,527
All those paintings were related to their lifestyles.

118
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:44,809
And when other kinds of people were shown, it was usually through some kind of

119
00:06:44,809 --> 00:06:48,190
ideological lens that really distorted how those people were shown.

120
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,543
Now realism wanted to redress that imbalance.

121
00:06:53,227 --> 00:06:56,850
I think it's fair to say that when games draw narratively from film and literature,

122
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,673
they usually draw from genre film and genre fiction,

123
00:07:00,673 --> 00:07:02,815
mostly science fiction, fantasy, and horror.

124
00:07:02,815 --> 00:07:08,000
Now, I loved genre fiction with a passion as a kid, and I still really love it.

125
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,085
In high school, I fell in love with the films of Terry Gilliam and David Cronenberg,

126
00:07:13,085 --> 00:07:15,127
who have mainly made genre movies,

127
00:07:15,127 --> 00:07:18,790
but whose works are transcendent in the way that all great art is.

128
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:25,311
But as much as I love genre fiction, I think that if you're really paying attention to the world around you,

129
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:33,036
there comes a point when you realize that real life is even more interesting than these kinds of fantasy worlds.

130
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:40,182
So later in my teenage years, I started to see films by David Lynch, Mike Lee, Ken Loach, and Nick Roeg.

131
00:07:40,182 --> 00:07:45,144
And by the time I got to college, I'd become a fully-fledged arthouse cinema fan.

132
00:07:45,144 --> 00:07:50,446
I saw a lot of weird, experimental film, a lot of international cinema, and a lot of great drama.

133
00:07:50,446 --> 00:07:55,248
And eventually, I realized that many of the films I liked best, which had the deepest emotion,

134
00:07:55,688 --> 00:08:00,591
and that were most helpful to me in figuring out what life is all about,

135
00:08:00,591 --> 00:08:04,833
were set in the real world and were about the extraordinary situations that we

136
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,414
regularly encounter

137
00:08:06,414 --> 00:08:11,798
in everyday life. Now what do we mean when we talk about realism in cinema?

138
00:08:11,798 --> 00:08:15,760
Well, there are probably lots of ways to trace that history, but here's just one of them.

139
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,203
A good starting point, I think, is Jean Renoir, a French writer and director.

140
00:08:20,203 --> 00:08:23,124
He was the son of the impressionist painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir.

141
00:08:24,877 --> 00:08:28,442
In 1937, Renoir released a film called Grand Illusion.

142
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:32,528
It's about the relationship between a group of people in a prisoner of war camp during

143
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:38,056
World War I as they work together on an escape plan across the boundaries of their nationality,

144
00:08:38,056 --> 00:08:40,540
their social class, and ethnicity.

145
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:45,869
Now Orson Welles cited this as one of his favorite films of all time.

146
00:08:45,869 --> 00:08:50,451
And it has an authenticity and a kind of a generous attitude to its characters

147
00:08:50,451 --> 00:08:53,752
that was pretty rare in film at that time.

148
00:08:53,752 --> 00:08:55,253
Um, and it's an amazing film.

149
00:08:55,253 --> 00:08:57,993
It's one of those films where two hours just flies by like that.

150
00:08:57,993 --> 00:08:59,594
I can't recommend it highly enough.

151
00:09:01,118 --> 00:09:03,519
So jumping forward a decade to the end of World War II,

152
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,960
and the Italian film industry had suddenly been freed from the censorship

153
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,961
imposed on it by Mussolini's fascist government.

154
00:09:10,961 --> 00:09:12,221
Influenced by Jean Renoir,

155
00:09:12,221 --> 00:09:16,483
a group of film critics took advantage of their newfound creative freedom

156
00:09:16,483 --> 00:09:20,324
to kickstart the cinematic movement now known as Neo-Realism.

157
00:09:20,324 --> 00:09:23,405
They began to make films about the lives of regular people,

158
00:09:23,405 --> 00:09:27,206
often using non-actors, and filmed on location against the beautiful

159
00:09:27,206 --> 00:09:30,607
but poverty-stricken background of post-war Italy.

160
00:09:32,097 --> 00:09:36,539
Now one amazing film to come out of this movement is Bicycle Thieves, from 1948.

161
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:41,140
It's about a father searching Rome for his stolen bicycle,

162
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,682
a bicycle without which he will lose the job that feeds his young family.

163
00:09:45,682 --> 00:09:51,223
A few years later, Italian neorealism lit the fuse for the French New Wave of cinema,

164
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:55,285
which was also founded by young film critics longing for innovation

165
00:09:55,285 --> 00:09:58,206
and working in collaboration with older French filmmakers

166
00:09:58,206 --> 00:10:01,087
who wanted to bring their experience to do something new.

167
00:10:02,506 --> 00:10:06,893
I'm sure you guys have heard of the French New Wave and its key directors Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut.

168
00:10:06,893 --> 00:10:11,380
My personal favorite film from this time is Truffaut's The 400 Blows.

169
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:16,929
It's a loosely autobiographical story about a misunderstood kid getting into trouble with the system.

170
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:23,755
By the way, I think it's really interesting to note that in both of these historically important film movements,

171
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:28,657
critics that had been writing about film became filmmakers themselves.

172
00:10:28,657 --> 00:10:32,638
And their work caused tremendous change all throughout the world.

173
00:10:32,638 --> 00:10:38,279
So even though the directors of the French New Wave were often reacting against a lot of Hollywood convention,

174
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:43,400
they ended up being massively influential on the next generation of Hollywood filmmakers,

175
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,241
everyone from Steven Spielberg to Martin Scorsese.

176
00:10:47,795 --> 00:10:53,101
And in just the same way, in games right now, critics and writers like Matty Bryce, Cara

177
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:56,945
Ellison and Tom Francis are becoming game designers.

178
00:10:56,945 --> 00:11:02,011
And the work that they're making is feeding right back into the mainstream of games in

179
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:04,493
many positive and very healthy ways.

180
00:11:06,217 --> 00:11:11,778
Anyway, so that's some historical setup for realist film. There are lots more reference points that you guys probably know about,

181
00:11:11,778 --> 00:11:15,800
from the 1960s kitchen sink dramas of the British new wave,

182
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,300
to the gritty realism of the 60s and 70s American filmmaking,

183
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:23,842
and of course there were lots of similar movements in international cinema.

184
00:11:23,842 --> 00:11:27,243
As just one example, the work of Indian directors like Chetan Anand.

185
00:11:28,264 --> 00:11:32,791
But now I want to tell you about a few great recent realist films that have had a big influence on me...

186
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:36,376
...and that I think might not be very well known in our community of game makers.

187
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:42,402
In 1999, the Scottish director Lynne Ramsay released this moving film called Rat Catcher.

188
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:46,104
The movie's innovative cinematography and editing was described as immersive

189
00:11:46,104 --> 00:11:49,345
by some critics, which I think is interesting in relation to games,

190
00:11:49,345 --> 00:11:54,107
and it showed that you can always find new things to do with an artistic form if you

191
00:11:54,107 --> 00:11:58,528
work at it. In games, I think we've barely begun to push cinematography

192
00:11:58,528 --> 00:12:02,510
in the way that this film does, in terms of unconventional framing and

193
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,030
impressionistic use of

194
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:07,312
light and unconventional editing, stuff like that.

195
00:12:08,468 --> 00:12:13,393
The movie's set in Glasgow in the early 70s, and like several of the films I want to tell you about,

196
00:12:13,393 --> 00:12:16,716
it's about a kid from a challenging background, this boy James.

197
00:12:16,716 --> 00:12:21,861
He's patiently waiting for his family to be relocated to a new public housing project

198
00:12:21,861 --> 00:12:25,385
as he tries to deal with the fallout from something bad that recently happened to him.

199
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:31,262
Coincidentally, another of the films I want to tell you about is set in Glasgow.

200
00:12:31,262 --> 00:12:37,204
One of two films that I'll tell you about by another British director, Andrea Arnold.

201
00:12:37,204 --> 00:12:41,685
Red Road from 2006 was made in response to a game-like project

202
00:12:41,685 --> 00:12:47,006
where a group of Danish and German film producers challenged three different filmmakers

203
00:12:47,006 --> 00:12:51,667
to use a number of the same predefined characters in three different movies.

204
00:12:52,991 --> 00:12:55,812
Red Road was the first movie to be made in response to this challenge.

205
00:12:55,812 --> 00:13:00,835
It's about a woman who works monitoring police closed-circuit television feeds

206
00:13:00,835 --> 00:13:04,297
from public housing projects, and in doing so she encounters

207
00:13:04,297 --> 00:13:09,119
a man from a very bad part of her past. These issues around voyeurism and

208
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:11,261
surveillance have been explored a bit by games,

209
00:13:11,261 --> 00:13:15,923
and I think they're an interesting fit for interactivity. Maybe this film shows

210
00:13:15,923 --> 00:13:16,803
us some new

211
00:13:16,803 --> 00:13:17,964
creative ways forward.

212
00:13:19,141 --> 00:13:21,863
The main character in this film, by the way, you might recognize.

213
00:13:21,863 --> 00:13:24,446
She's played by the brilliant Kate Dickey,

214
00:13:24,446 --> 00:13:27,188
who also plays Lyssa Arryn in Game of Thrones.

215
00:13:27,188 --> 00:13:30,371
Andrea Arnold's next film, Fish Tank,

216
00:13:30,371 --> 00:13:35,675
is one of those rare films that manages to be both funny and heart-rending.

217
00:13:35,675 --> 00:13:40,559
It's about an isolated teenage girl whose only real passion is hip-hop dance,

218
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,263
as she struggles to find her way through life and to try and connect with the world.

219
00:13:45,078 --> 00:13:47,639
It's got Michael Fassbender in it, I'm sure you know.

220
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,301
He's done a lot of amazing work, including his turn as Archie Hickox in

221
00:13:51,301 --> 00:13:52,882
Inglourious Bastards,

222
00:13:52,882 --> 00:13:58,625
and first-time actor Katie Jarvis is really brilliant in the main role.

223
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:02,087
Another British realist film that I think some of you might have seen is

224
00:14:02,087 --> 00:14:03,948
Weekend, directed by Andrew Hay.

225
00:14:03,948 --> 00:14:06,530
This is a very powerful and moving film

226
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:09,651
about two men who hook up on a Friday night, beginning what

227
00:14:09,651 --> 00:14:12,013
initially just seems like a casual sexual encounter.

228
00:14:13,124 --> 00:14:16,146
But as the relationship unfolds over the course of the weekend,

229
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:20,889
the film manages to explore big issues around intimacy and commitment,

230
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:25,152
as well as leading a political discussion about what life is like for gay people

231
00:14:25,152 --> 00:14:26,193
in contemporary society.

232
00:14:27,764 --> 00:14:31,749
And like a number of other realist films, this movie has great

233
00:14:31,749 --> 00:14:35,893
sort of documentary feel that comes from its camera work, its lighting,

234
00:14:35,893 --> 00:14:38,917
and its naturalized dialogue, some of which was improvised.

235
00:14:38,917 --> 00:14:43,202
As game storytelling matures, I think we're going to see these kinds of

236
00:14:43,202 --> 00:14:47,286
techniques coming more and more to the fore in various kinds of cinematic games.

237
00:14:49,134 --> 00:14:54,299
Now I'd be remiss if I didn't quickly tell you about two star directors of contemporary realist film,

238
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:57,982
these guys, Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, better known as the Dardenne Brothers.

239
00:14:57,982 --> 00:15:01,985
This Belgian duo started out making features and documentaries in the 70s,

240
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:06,689
and then began to build an international following with a sequence of very naturalistic films

241
00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:10,473
about people struggling to get by in contemporary Belgian society.

242
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:16,244
Any of their films would make a really great starting point for you guys, but The Kid With A Bike

243
00:15:16,244 --> 00:15:18,585
from a couple of years ago is incredibly powerful

244
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:23,526
and it's available to stream on your favorite digital movie service.

245
00:15:23,526 --> 00:15:26,707
Also, if you are looking out carefully, there's an Uncharted 2 poster on

246
00:15:26,707 --> 00:15:32,309
a bedroom wall in one of the scenes. That's not why I chose this, but I couldn't resist telling you about that.

247
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:37,064
And finally, I want to tell you about a really amazing movie that I saw in the

248
00:15:37,064 --> 00:15:38,946
theater just a few weeks ago.

249
00:15:38,946 --> 00:15:42,470
It's a groundbreaking film set in a part of the world that we don't often get a

250
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,592
very clear view of, I think.

251
00:15:44,592 --> 00:15:47,855
It's called Wajda, directed by Haifa Al-Mansur,

252
00:15:47,855 --> 00:15:51,399
and it's the first Saudi Arabian film in history to be directed by a woman.

253
00:15:53,351 --> 00:15:56,792
Funnily enough, it's another realist film that prominently features bicycles.

254
00:15:56,792 --> 00:15:58,912
I don't know what's going on there.

255
00:15:58,912 --> 00:16:02,433
It's about the title character Wajda's dream of buying a bike

256
00:16:02,433 --> 00:16:05,834
when everyone around her tells her that she shouldn't have one

257
00:16:05,834 --> 00:16:07,134
because she's a girl.

258
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:10,955
This is a really understated and subtle movie

259
00:16:10,955 --> 00:16:13,696
and it's also very funny and moving, so check it out.

260
00:16:13,696 --> 00:16:15,236
Hopefully it'll come out online soon.

261
00:16:16,729 --> 00:16:19,072
So what kind of influence do these films have on me?

262
00:16:19,072 --> 00:16:22,916
Well, they make me long for more realist games.

263
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,959
Games about our day-to-day lives and experiences.

264
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:28,442
Something you might notice about these films,

265
00:16:28,442 --> 00:16:31,986
many of them are about women, young people, and children.

266
00:16:31,986 --> 00:16:34,389
And these are groups that don't often receive

267
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:37,011
very detailed or nuanced portraits

268
00:16:37,011 --> 00:16:38,733
in either films or games.

269
00:16:39,811 --> 00:16:41,632
And I don't think I'm the only one who's interested in this stuff.

270
00:16:41,632 --> 00:16:46,074
Some of the most interesting and impactful games of the past few years

271
00:16:46,074 --> 00:16:48,115
could be seen as realist games.

272
00:16:48,115 --> 00:16:50,257
Games like Ananthropy's Dysphoria,

273
00:16:50,257 --> 00:16:52,077
Richard Hoffmeier's Cart Life,

274
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:54,159
Gone Home by the Fulbright Company,

275
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:57,040
and I Get This Call Every Day by David S. Gallant.

276
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,882
Now, these games are about regular people

277
00:16:59,882 --> 00:17:01,963
struggling with the circumstances of their lives.

278
00:17:01,963 --> 00:17:04,764
And that makes these artworks valuable to us

279
00:17:04,764 --> 00:17:07,906
as individuals and as a society.

280
00:17:10,007 --> 00:17:18,295
So I'm very interested in emotion in games, and I think that we, as game designers, have a lot to learn from realist movies like the ones I've told you about today.

281
00:17:18,295 --> 00:17:27,283
These films work because they slow their pace, and they take the time to show the nuance in the dynamics of the relationships between their characters.

282
00:17:27,283 --> 00:17:34,770
And as a result, they offer emotional experiences that are as deep and as strong as any that we can find in the arts.

283
00:17:35,551 --> 00:17:36,612
So check out some of these films.

284
00:17:36,612 --> 00:17:38,614
I'm going to tweet the list and a few more

285
00:17:38,614 --> 00:17:40,256
that I didn't get time to talk about today.

286
00:17:40,256 --> 00:17:42,399
And I'll look forward to seeing how

287
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:46,363
they might influence your guys' game design practice.

288
00:17:46,363 --> 00:17:48,165
Thanks very much for your time.

289
00:17:48,165 --> 00:17:48,565
Cheers.

290
00:17:55,385 --> 00:17:55,885
Awesome.

291
00:17:55,885 --> 00:17:57,586
Thanks a lot, Rich.

292
00:17:57,586 --> 00:17:59,508
Next up, we've got Kelly Santiago.

293
00:17:59,508 --> 00:18:04,051
You probably know she was a big part of Journey.

294
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:07,634
You probably know she is now the developer's best friend

295
00:18:07,634 --> 00:18:08,515
at OUYA.

296
00:18:08,515 --> 00:18:13,479
However, did you know she performed in a high school

297
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:16,962
competition show choir, just like we see on Glee

298
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:17,942
every week?

299
00:18:17,942 --> 00:18:21,125
A little known fact about Kelly.

300
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,406
So come on up, Kelly.

301
00:18:27,937 --> 00:18:32,418
I said send two facts to say I didn't know what they meant.

302
00:18:32,418 --> 00:18:35,059
So he spoke.

303
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:36,579
I'm kind of nervous about this.

304
00:18:36,579 --> 00:18:38,980
Whoa, the font is super small.

305
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:43,101
So when Colleen and John approached me about this panel,

306
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:46,682
there was an artist that immediately came to mind.

307
00:18:46,682 --> 00:18:49,803
The work of this artist has been with me so long,

308
00:18:49,803 --> 00:18:51,424
as long as I can remember.

309
00:18:51,424 --> 00:18:54,184
And I feel that many, many times over the course

310
00:18:54,184 --> 00:18:57,245
of my artistic life and my career in video games.

311
00:18:57,801 --> 00:19:02,847
His work has resurfaced again and again, and each time I find something new to take away from it.

312
00:19:02,847 --> 00:19:06,492
It's as though his work, while it remains somewhat...

313
00:19:06,766 --> 00:19:09,728
the same kind of evolves along with me.

314
00:19:09,728 --> 00:19:14,130
And I think it must mean that's a really deep ingrained

315
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,691
part of myself.

316
00:19:15,691 --> 00:19:18,192
And I think it's led to some of the main guiding principles

317
00:19:18,192 --> 00:19:21,594
I bring to my work, that they actually stem directly

318
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:23,075
from his body of work.

319
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:27,217
But I thought instead of trying to describe its impact,

320
00:19:27,217 --> 00:19:30,099
I think it's best to witness a sample

321
00:19:30,099 --> 00:19:34,702
so you can experience its potential impact on society.

322
00:19:37,262 --> 00:19:38,523
Let's wait.

323
00:19:38,523 --> 00:19:45,209
The link didn't work, though.

324
00:19:45,209 --> 00:19:46,470
Should I just go over?

325
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:46,510
OK.

326
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:49,612
Not the Atlantic.

327
00:19:49,612 --> 00:19:52,895
Where's my, anybody see my mouse?

328
00:19:52,895 --> 00:19:57,399
Oh, it's still on this screen.

329
00:19:57,399 --> 00:19:57,719
There.

330
00:19:57,719 --> 00:19:59,180
There you go.

331
00:19:59,180 --> 00:19:59,521
Oh, great.

332
00:19:59,521 --> 00:20:00,341
Perfect.

333
00:20:12,281 --> 00:20:17,925
Mee Mee Mee Mee

334
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:23,489
Mee Mee, Mee Mee Mee

335
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:30,194
Mee Mee, Mee Mee

336
00:20:30,194 --> 00:20:33,776
Mee Mee Mee Mee

337
00:21:10,717 --> 00:21:23,640
So, as you figured out, it's Jim Henson and the Muppets.

338
00:21:28,935 --> 00:21:32,076
So yes, while I was sort of setting up a joke there,

339
00:21:32,076 --> 00:21:33,736
my introduction is still true.

340
00:21:33,736 --> 00:21:36,817
I revisit his work and his life over and over again

341
00:21:36,817 --> 00:21:39,098
and keep finding things that resonate with me

342
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:41,038
and the things I've learned in my work.

343
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:45,419
So I thought I'd share some of those themes and ideas

344
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:46,499
with you.

345
00:21:46,499 --> 00:21:49,060
So one of my guiding principles I credit to Jim Henson

346
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,960
is that it is about the journey.

347
00:21:51,657 --> 00:21:54,219
Yes, pun not intended maybe, but not the destination.

348
00:21:54,219 --> 00:22:02,766
Goals are awesome and drive us to challenge ourselves and one another to achieve great things,

349
00:22:02,766 --> 00:22:06,949
but you can't gloss over those days in between deliverables.

350
00:22:06,949 --> 00:22:10,913
I don't believe that the ends justify the means.

351
00:22:11,633 --> 00:22:15,217
and it's the means, those day-to-day experiences

352
00:22:15,217 --> 00:22:16,838
that really comprise the majority

353
00:22:16,838 --> 00:22:18,960
of our existence here on Earth.

354
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,342
And I think that's important to remember.

355
00:22:21,342 --> 00:22:24,025
Jim Henson really strived to create a working environment

356
00:22:24,025 --> 00:22:27,147
for his artists that was just as enjoyable to work in

357
00:22:27,147 --> 00:22:28,689
as the material that they were working on.

358
00:22:28,689 --> 00:22:31,071
And he wanted the people on his team

359
00:22:31,071 --> 00:22:35,635
to feel good day-to-day and that translates into their work.

360
00:22:36,262 --> 00:22:39,504
And I do believe that the experience you have while

361
00:22:39,504 --> 00:22:42,407
creating a work impacts the emotions felt through that work.

362
00:22:42,407 --> 00:22:45,749
I think audiences have an ability to perceive heart

363
00:22:45,749 --> 00:22:46,850
through a game.

364
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:51,093
We often really get too focused on that next deliverable

365
00:22:51,093 --> 00:22:53,015
and not on the days we spend getting there.

366
00:22:53,015 --> 00:22:55,737
We spend most of our days with one another

367
00:22:55,737 --> 00:22:57,138
as co-developers on a game.

368
00:22:57,138 --> 00:22:59,920
And sometimes we spend more time with one another

369
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,143
than we do with our family members and significant others.

370
00:23:04,064 --> 00:23:11,050
And please remember that as I say this, that I am a huge advocate for the power of video games as a medium,

371
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:19,538
for video games as art, and that games play a hugely impactful role in our society.

372
00:23:19,538 --> 00:23:22,761
But at the end of the day, we work on fucking games.

373
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:26,503
Like, there's nothing about that and what we do

374
00:23:26,503 --> 00:23:30,185
that's worth hurting ourselves, hurting one another,

375
00:23:30,185 --> 00:23:31,586
or the ones that we love.

376
00:23:31,586 --> 00:23:35,788
So we should definitely incorporate more musical numbers

377
00:23:35,788 --> 00:23:37,189
into our data rate process as well.

378
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:42,354
So second is to be creative, you have to take risks.

379
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:43,834
And in order to take risks, you have

380
00:23:43,834 --> 00:23:44,974
to feel that you're in an environment which

381
00:23:44,974 --> 00:23:46,395
is safe to fail.

382
00:23:46,395 --> 00:23:49,576
This was really a motto of Henson's

383
00:23:49,576 --> 00:23:53,157
and certainly came out through many of the trials

384
00:23:53,157 --> 00:23:54,977
and tribulations that the Muppets faced

385
00:23:54,977 --> 00:23:57,058
in putting on a show every night.

386
00:23:57,893 --> 00:24:11,117
It's also one of the biggest mistakes I see happening in our industry, which somehow I feel has perpetuated this notion that everyone thrives better in a really competitive, hostile environment in which you're asked to prove yourself every day.

387
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:20,899
And I think it's why we drive many brilliant, creative people away from making games professionally, and especially in the commercial marketplace.

388
00:24:20,899 --> 00:24:25,600
So this statement right here, it's the key to innovation. It's everything.

389
00:24:26,954 --> 00:24:29,135
So now I'm not saying that you have to create an environment

390
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:33,298
in which everyone is pampered and everyone wins all the time.

391
00:24:33,298 --> 00:24:35,740
I think you want to put together the right team for your game

392
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,920
from the start.

393
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,522
But once I've decided to work with someone,

394
00:24:39,522 --> 00:24:42,444
I give them enough rope to hang themselves with.

395
00:24:42,444 --> 00:24:45,265
Because that's when I think creative people

396
00:24:45,265 --> 00:24:46,926
produce their best work.

397
00:24:47,347 --> 00:24:50,088
You want a team of people that push and challenge one another

398
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:52,308
because they come from different backgrounds,

399
00:24:52,308 --> 00:24:54,889
they're bringing different ideas to the table,

400
00:24:54,889 --> 00:24:56,730
and all of those ideas can be heard.

401
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:59,971
That's how you get the best ideas,

402
00:24:59,971 --> 00:25:02,932
not by pitting a homogenous group of people

403
00:25:02,932 --> 00:25:03,733
against one another.

404
00:25:06,753 --> 00:25:10,894
And this point might seem a bit dodgy based

405
00:25:10,894 --> 00:25:12,135
on what I just said.

406
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,076
But going back to my second point,

407
00:25:14,076 --> 00:25:17,577
the people you work with, you might as well be dating,

408
00:25:17,577 --> 00:25:17,897
really.

409
00:25:17,897 --> 00:25:20,738
You're in a totally committed relationship with them

410
00:25:20,738 --> 00:25:21,699
of ups and downs.

411
00:25:21,699 --> 00:25:24,200
And you have to work through problems.

412
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,060
And at times, you're really stuck with each other.

413
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:29,802
So you spend at least as much time with them

414
00:25:29,802 --> 00:25:31,502
as you would a significant other.

415
00:25:31,502 --> 00:25:33,563
And sometimes, that person.

416
00:25:34,303 --> 00:25:38,746
is the person that is perfect on paper to do the job that you want them to do,

417
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:44,429
or that you need to get done on your project, won't actually help you get your game done,

418
00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:50,132
because working with them is such a chore or a challenge for, you know, whatever reason.

419
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:54,034
I have never successfully just handed off a chunk of work on a game to someone and just have them

420
00:25:54,034 --> 00:26:00,337
go away and do the work and come back. It's always required some back and forth and a relationship

421
00:26:00,337 --> 00:26:00,578
there.

422
00:26:01,486 --> 00:26:06,829
So conversely, I would rather change some of the aspects

423
00:26:06,829 --> 00:26:10,612
of my game that I'm working on in order to incorporate

424
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:12,673
a person on my team who I think is brilliant

425
00:26:12,673 --> 00:26:13,994
and that I want to work with,

426
00:26:13,994 --> 00:26:17,236
but may not have those exact skill sets

427
00:26:17,236 --> 00:26:21,699
that I needed to get the game done as I was envisioning it.

428
00:26:21,699 --> 00:26:22,260
So that makes sense.

429
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,021
I would rather kind of curve the design of the game

430
00:26:25,021 --> 00:26:26,242
to incorporate a person onto my team

431
00:26:26,242 --> 00:26:27,163
that I really want to work with,

432
00:26:27,163 --> 00:26:30,605
because ultimately I think that game is way better.

433
00:26:34,452 --> 00:26:45,840
Moving away from team process, this aspect of the creative process has always been one I've held dear, and it's been shown to me time and time again to be true.

434
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:53,786
I actually wrestled between talking about David Lynch and Jim Henson for this reason, because I've found it to be so core.

435
00:26:54,705 --> 00:26:58,326
For those of you familiar with my talks on game design process

436
00:26:58,326 --> 00:27:01,427
at that game company, yes, it's important to have

437
00:27:01,427 --> 00:27:04,328
a core focus or theme for your project.

438
00:27:04,328 --> 00:27:06,649
And it's important to weigh features and work

439
00:27:06,649 --> 00:27:09,230
against whether or not they will achieve

440
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,290
your goal for your game.

441
00:27:11,031 --> 00:27:18,958
But sometimes I think you get that inspiration, or if you're not the lead creative on the project, the person you're working with will get that inspiration.

442
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:28,227
And I believe you just got to go with it sometimes. It may not always make logical sense, but you can feel that it's right.

443
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:33,949
And I say at those moments, you know, let the critical studies students make sense of this later.

444
00:27:33,949 --> 00:27:34,550
Well, they will.

445
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:39,992
You know, Hinson was inspired to create Dark Crystal,

446
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:43,913
despite its obvious departures from the work that he was most famous for.

447
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:46,374
And initial testings of the films were so bad,

448
00:27:46,374 --> 00:27:50,775
that the distribution company was pulling so much of their confidence and support out of the project,

449
00:27:50,775 --> 00:27:53,936
that Hinson bought the film from them to distribute himself.

450
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:58,280
Initial box office was bad and initial reviews were bad.

451
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,783
But of course, we know it went on to become

452
00:28:00,783 --> 00:28:03,465
one of the top 20 grossing films in America that year

453
00:28:03,465 --> 00:28:07,689
and has grown in critical and financial success ever since.

454
00:28:07,689 --> 00:28:12,213
So confession, you know, sometimes when Jenova and I

455
00:28:12,213 --> 00:28:14,075
are talking about our design process

456
00:28:14,075 --> 00:28:17,158
on one of the games that we published on PlayStation Network

457
00:28:18,841 --> 00:28:25,745
It sounds so neat, our journey from inspiration into application in the game and how it ended up,

458
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:31,709
but it really looks at times a lot messier than that. And sometimes it is just, you kind of wake

459
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:38,193
up and you see the scene and you know that's the scene, that you know that's how it's got to be.

460
00:28:38,193 --> 00:28:43,316
And you kind of, in 20-20 hindsight, can string the pieces together. But in the moment,

461
00:28:43,316 --> 00:28:44,737
you just, you're going on your gut.

462
00:28:46,769 --> 00:28:52,410
And in the end, sometimes you just can't take yourself too seriously.

463
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:54,171
And silliness is a virtue.

464
00:28:54,171 --> 00:28:55,131
Thank you.

465
00:28:55,131 --> 00:28:55,871
All right.

466
00:28:55,871 --> 00:29:00,072
Thank you, Kelly.

467
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,872
That was awesome.

468
00:29:02,872 --> 00:29:06,433
I want to see like the comparison between Henson and David Lynch.

469
00:29:06,433 --> 00:29:07,873
I want to see that mashup.

470
00:29:07,873 --> 00:29:10,634
That just sounds incredible.

471
00:29:10,634 --> 00:29:13,755
So next up we have Ben Esposito.

472
00:29:17,611 --> 00:29:21,654
So Ben was a level designer for the PS3 game, The Unfinished

473
00:29:21,654 --> 00:29:27,119
Swan, awesome game, and used to run a basement music

474
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:28,220
venue in upstate New York.

475
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,501
Was that your basement, Ben?

476
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:30,562
It was not my basement.

477
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:31,763
All right, cool.

478
00:29:31,763 --> 00:29:33,064
Take it away, Ben.

479
00:29:33,064 --> 00:29:35,106
All right, hey.

480
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,267
I wanted to talk to you.

481
00:29:36,267 --> 00:29:40,410
OK, so I first wanted to say that I think film definitely

482
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:43,453
influences my work a lot, but I would say music probably does

483
00:29:43,453 --> 00:29:43,853
more.

484
00:29:44,724 --> 00:29:48,585
My background is, a lot of it is from music and electronic music.

485
00:29:48,585 --> 00:29:51,545
And so I want to talk about Brian Eno, who

486
00:29:51,545 --> 00:29:55,706
is one of the most influential electronic musicians,

487
00:29:55,706 --> 00:29:59,487
or like, did whatever, like synthesizer

488
00:29:59,487 --> 00:30:00,107
and electronic music.

489
00:30:00,107 --> 00:30:04,028
So he's also the most quotable guy on the planet.

490
00:30:04,028 --> 00:30:05,488
So I'm going to show you quotes.

491
00:30:05,488 --> 00:30:09,229
And I'm going to, if you talk to me afterwards,

492
00:30:09,229 --> 00:30:11,670
I'll give you some resources for awesome stuff, like interviews

493
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:12,310
and stuff that he says.

494
00:30:12,916 --> 00:30:16,117
So kind of the main idea I wanted to start with

495
00:30:16,117 --> 00:30:18,458
was this one quote, which says, the idea

496
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:20,779
is to produce things that are strange and mysterious to you

497
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:22,160
as the first music you ever heard.

498
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:26,261
And to me, that's kind of a goal with a lot of my work,

499
00:30:26,261 --> 00:30:30,143
is to reproduce those kind of magical experiences

500
00:30:30,143 --> 00:30:32,644
that you didn't quite understand at first.

501
00:30:32,644 --> 00:30:34,545
So I'm going to try to tie that back up.

502
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:38,441
So if you're not familiar with Brian Eno's work,

503
00:30:38,441 --> 00:30:41,703
he's known for working with David Bowie and Devo

504
00:30:41,703 --> 00:30:42,684
in Talking Heads.

505
00:30:42,684 --> 00:30:47,827
He also produced Coldplay and U2 for More Contemporary.

506
00:30:47,827 --> 00:30:49,648
He popularized the term ambient music,

507
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:53,631
and he also popularized the term generative music

508
00:30:53,631 --> 00:30:56,773
with his album Discrete Music that I'm going to talk about

509
00:30:56,773 --> 00:30:57,433
a little bit later.

510
00:30:58,108 --> 00:31:01,531
which was kind of both ambient and generative.

511
00:31:01,531 --> 00:31:05,854
He's also known for some video and installation art.

512
00:31:05,854 --> 00:31:09,777
77 Million Paintings was one of his generative works

513
00:31:09,777 --> 00:31:12,519
that is kind of like generative paintings set

514
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:13,340
to generative music.

515
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:17,903
And the idea is that there's 77 million possible combinations.

516
00:31:17,903 --> 00:31:20,605
And it would take you like 450 years of watching it

517
00:31:20,605 --> 00:31:21,626
to see all of them.

518
00:31:23,652 --> 00:31:26,492
OK, so first I wanted to talk about how I was introduced

519
00:31:26,492 --> 00:31:27,153
to Brian Eno.

520
00:31:27,153 --> 00:31:31,554
So I'll play you the first piece that I ever heard,

521
00:31:31,554 --> 00:31:35,195
and it was pretty influential to me.

522
00:31:35,195 --> 00:31:37,735
And so I want to make sure sound's on.

523
00:31:37,735 --> 00:31:42,236
All right, and so you might have heard this song too.

524
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:42,657
So I'll play it.

525
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,652
So it's six seconds long.

526
00:31:51,652 --> 00:31:54,575
If you don't know where it's from,

527
00:31:54,575 --> 00:31:56,737
it's the Windows 95 startup sound.

528
00:31:56,737 --> 00:32:04,445
So Microsoft commissioned him to produce a piece of music

529
00:32:04,445 --> 00:32:09,190
that was kind of like, they used every possible adjective

530
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,612
to describe this piece of music.

531
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:14,182
futuristic and nostalgic and sentimental.

532
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:18,564
And so he wasn't a big fan of Microsoft,

533
00:32:18,564 --> 00:32:20,365
but he did think the challenge of making

534
00:32:20,365 --> 00:32:24,427
a three-second piece of music was incredible and kind of funny.

535
00:32:24,427 --> 00:32:27,688
So I think that's a good encapsulation

536
00:32:27,688 --> 00:32:29,149
of a lot of the stuff he talks about.

537
00:32:29,988 --> 00:32:35,295
So what's important to Brian Eno is theory over practice.

538
00:32:35,295 --> 00:32:38,459
And it's something that I kind of subscribe to, too.

539
00:32:38,459 --> 00:32:40,861
Where there is certainly a craft to music,

540
00:32:40,861 --> 00:32:42,263
and there's a craft to developing games.

541
00:32:42,976 --> 00:32:44,257
and any form of art.

542
00:32:44,257 --> 00:32:46,999
But in terms of being an artist, I

543
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:50,261
think process is the most important thing to me.

544
00:32:50,261 --> 00:32:54,684
So Brian Eno, all of his work is informed

545
00:32:54,684 --> 00:32:58,466
by a specific theory or process that he wants to explore.

546
00:32:58,466 --> 00:33:02,148
And so he says, even though the viewer or the listener

547
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:03,169
or the player might not.

548
00:33:03,901 --> 00:33:07,383
understand or be aware of the theory behind what they're

549
00:33:07,383 --> 00:33:08,444
experiencing.

550
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:11,226
It's the fact that it informed it meant that it could create

551
00:33:11,226 --> 00:33:14,649
an experience that they might not have otherwise seen.

552
00:33:14,649 --> 00:33:18,772
So the next thing I want to talk about is constraint.

553
00:33:18,772 --> 00:33:20,693
So he's got this other great quote.

554
00:33:20,693 --> 00:33:23,735
There's a reason that guitar players invariably produce

555
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:25,377
more interesting music than synth players.

556
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,859
And it's that you can go through the options on a guitar

557
00:33:27,859 --> 00:33:28,579
in a minute.

558
00:33:28,579 --> 00:33:31,021
After that, you have to make aesthetic and stylistic

559
00:33:31,021 --> 00:33:31,901
decisions.

560
00:33:31,901 --> 00:33:36,325
And so I think this applies to digital artists,

561
00:33:36,325 --> 00:33:39,147
because when the synthesizer came out.

562
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:44,562
It's got all these knobs and you kind of have an infinite amount of options.

563
00:33:44,562 --> 00:33:49,005
And that often makes it way more difficult for you to produce anything interesting.

564
00:33:49,005 --> 00:33:52,787
And so, yeah, this quote kind of ties it up nicely where he says,

565
00:33:52,787 --> 00:33:56,168
what you need are fewer possibilities that are more interesting.

566
00:33:56,168 --> 00:34:00,871
And so, what he wants to create are constraints that allow you

567
00:34:00,871 --> 00:34:07,294
to be making aesthetic and stylistic decisions rather than technical decisions.

568
00:34:08,565 --> 00:34:10,946
So I want to talk about one of his most famous works,

569
00:34:10,946 --> 00:34:11,607
Discrete Music.

570
00:34:11,607 --> 00:34:14,449
It's a piece of ambient music, and it's

571
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:16,990
a piece of generative music.

572
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:18,892
And I'll describe what ambient music means.

573
00:34:18,892 --> 00:34:20,393
You probably are familiar with it now.

574
00:34:20,393 --> 00:34:23,935
But the story behind the album is that Brian Eno

575
00:34:23,935 --> 00:34:25,376
got into a car crash.

576
00:34:25,376 --> 00:34:26,276
And he was.

577
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:30,196
recovering in bed, and he wanted to listen to music.

578
00:34:30,196 --> 00:34:34,419
And so he had a record of classical harp music.

579
00:34:34,419 --> 00:34:37,101
And so he got up, and he mustered all his strength

580
00:34:37,101 --> 00:34:38,862
to put the record on.

581
00:34:38,862 --> 00:34:42,984
And he moved the needle on, and he went back and laid in bed.

582
00:34:42,984 --> 00:34:45,046
And then couldn't really hear the music.

583
00:34:45,046 --> 00:34:46,647
And it turns out the volume was down.

584
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,981
to an almost imperceptible level,

585
00:34:49,981 --> 00:34:53,663
but he felt too weak to go and turn the volume up.

586
00:34:53,663 --> 00:34:56,665
So he decided to listen to the music

587
00:34:56,665 --> 00:34:57,985
at this almost imperceptible volume.

588
00:34:57,985 --> 00:35:00,607
And so it kind of came in and out of consciousness.

589
00:35:00,607 --> 00:35:03,128
And that was, this is his quote,

590
00:35:03,128 --> 00:35:07,051
this presented what was for me a new way of hearing music

591
00:35:07,051 --> 00:35:08,912
as part of the ambience of the environment,

592
00:35:08,912 --> 00:35:10,713
just as the color of the light and the sound of the rain

593
00:35:10,713 --> 00:35:13,795
were parts of that ambience.

594
00:35:19,211 --> 00:35:25,135
So ambient music is about the gray area between attention

595
00:35:25,135 --> 00:35:26,996
and background.

596
00:35:26,996 --> 00:35:31,639
And so that's an area I really enjoy exploring in my work,

597
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:35,502
where instead of upfront systems and game mechanics,

598
00:35:35,502 --> 00:35:39,265
I think creating environments and worlds that

599
00:35:39,265 --> 00:35:41,626
dance between things that are worthy of attention,

600
00:35:41,626 --> 00:35:45,189
things that are the background, are the most interesting places

601
00:35:45,189 --> 00:35:45,689
to explore.

602
00:35:46,734 --> 00:35:48,995
And then the other part of discrete music

603
00:35:48,995 --> 00:35:49,975
is that it's generative.

604
00:35:49,975 --> 00:35:55,997
And what that means is that the piece is started with a seed,

605
00:35:55,997 --> 00:35:59,958
and then some other process that is set up by the artist

606
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:01,319
finishes the work for you.

607
00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:03,319
And so you don't necessarily have control

608
00:36:03,319 --> 00:36:04,560
over the final product.

609
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,640
You just started it.

610
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,701
And that's kind of video games.

611
00:36:10,213 --> 00:36:13,334
software does this really well, but it kind of was being

612
00:36:13,334 --> 00:36:16,415
explored for generations and generations before that in

613
00:36:16,415 --> 00:36:17,676
other forms of art.

614
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:22,377
And so on the back of Discrete Music, he generously

615
00:36:22,377 --> 00:36:26,098
reproduced the diagram of how the work was produced.

616
00:36:26,098 --> 00:36:28,539
It's a 30-minute piece.

617
00:36:28,539 --> 00:36:31,500
And the idea is that it starts on a synthesizer and then goes

618
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,060
into a tape recorder.

619
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:36,581
And then that tape goes to a tape player.

620
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:39,251
which goes back into the tape recorder,

621
00:36:39,251 --> 00:36:41,572
and then gets recorded.

622
00:36:41,572 --> 00:36:45,513
And so the idea is he starts with a synth line,

623
00:36:45,513 --> 00:36:48,755
and there's kind of like a melodic idea behind it.

624
00:36:48,755 --> 00:36:50,835
And then it feeds back onto itself

625
00:36:50,835 --> 00:36:52,316
at a different point in time.

626
00:36:52,316 --> 00:36:57,338
And he can stretch the delay and make it shorter or longer

627
00:36:57,338 --> 00:37:00,259
to kind of create new results that were unexpected.

628
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,659
And that was.

629
00:37:02,745 --> 00:37:07,187
and amazing at the time, and the technology allowed that.

630
00:37:07,187 --> 00:37:10,229
But it's something that we can do now,

631
00:37:10,229 --> 00:37:14,751
where we can plant the seeds and have an intention behind it.

632
00:37:14,751 --> 00:37:20,554
But I think letting the viewer take hold of what that means

633
00:37:20,554 --> 00:37:24,096
and how the system affected it is really

634
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,817
important to digital works.

635
00:37:25,817 --> 00:37:27,777
So I want to talk a little bit about.

636
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:31,711
This game is in Finish Swan.

637
00:37:31,711 --> 00:37:35,154
If you don't know it, it starts and it's all white,

638
00:37:35,154 --> 00:37:40,197
and you throw black paint to reveal the environment.

639
00:37:40,197 --> 00:37:44,260
And this was, for me, an ambient game in a lot of ways.

640
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,762
So there's not much gameplay other than getting

641
00:37:46,762 --> 00:37:48,263
from point A to point B.

642
00:37:48,263 --> 00:37:53,106
And a lot of the level design.

643
00:37:53,763 --> 00:37:56,045
Like, the focus for me on the level design

644
00:37:56,045 --> 00:37:57,907
were things that were ambient.

645
00:37:57,907 --> 00:38:00,849
So because there is no gameplay per se,

646
00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:05,294
interacting with other agents in the system,

647
00:38:05,294 --> 00:38:08,877
I wanted all the details and objects and backgrounds

648
00:38:08,877 --> 00:38:11,700
to take the place of that and kind of be

649
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,883
able to go in and out of your consciousness

650
00:38:14,883 --> 00:38:15,623
and your attention.

651
00:38:18,292 --> 00:38:22,580
So this is a deck of cards called Oblique Strategies.

652
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:26,589
This has more to do with his idea of constraint,

653
00:38:26,589 --> 00:38:28,412
and I think has helped inform my process a lot.

654
00:38:30,951 --> 00:38:32,613
Oblique strategies is a deck of cards

655
00:38:32,613 --> 00:38:36,357
that's a bunch of challenges or dilemmas

656
00:38:36,357 --> 00:38:38,178
to help you get over blocks in your work.

657
00:38:38,178 --> 00:38:41,242
These are a couple of examples, like honor thy error

658
00:38:41,242 --> 00:38:42,083
as a hidden intention.

659
00:38:42,083 --> 00:38:45,306
An idea is when you're blocked, you can take the card out.

660
00:38:45,306 --> 00:38:48,309
And a lot of them are kind of funny and will make you laugh.

661
00:38:48,309 --> 00:38:50,131
And that's really important to the idea

662
00:38:50,131 --> 00:38:51,853
because you can't just block.

663
00:38:53,388 --> 00:38:58,571
I think, and what Brian says, is when you react to something

664
00:38:58,571 --> 00:39:02,154
with a laugh, it kind of means that there's

665
00:39:02,154 --> 00:39:05,096
some truth to it that you probably hadn't considered.

666
00:39:05,096 --> 00:39:07,297
It's a subversion of expectations.

667
00:39:07,297 --> 00:39:10,379
And so I think these are really useful literally,

668
00:39:10,379 --> 00:39:14,922
but also just in the sense of creating a constraint that you

669
00:39:14,922 --> 00:39:16,883
maybe didn't have control over will help

670
00:39:16,883 --> 00:39:19,565
you become way more creative.

671
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:20,826
So this is my current game.

672
00:39:20,826 --> 00:39:21,406
It's called Kachina.

673
00:39:23,054 --> 00:39:25,935
You control this hole in the ground, and you move it around,

674
00:39:25,935 --> 00:39:28,376
and stuff falls inside.

675
00:39:28,376 --> 00:39:30,677
And it gets bigger every time.

676
00:39:30,677 --> 00:39:32,957
So this came out of a game jam.

677
00:39:32,957 --> 00:39:36,799
And I think game jams are really important to game

678
00:39:36,799 --> 00:39:39,339
development, not necessarily as a way of starting a game,

679
00:39:39,339 --> 00:39:43,180
but just in terms of having a constraint for your process

680
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:46,201
that will help you come up with brand new ideas and

681
00:39:46,201 --> 00:39:46,842
innovative solutions.

682
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:50,563
So in the case of a game jam, your artistic constraint is

683
00:39:50,563 --> 00:39:50,923
time.

684
00:39:51,408 --> 00:39:54,951
And the time constraint led me to this art style,

685
00:39:54,951 --> 00:39:57,573
because it's so simple.

686
00:39:57,573 --> 00:39:59,314
And it's 3D, but it's all flat-shaded.

687
00:39:59,314 --> 00:39:59,934
There's no lighting.

688
00:39:59,934 --> 00:40:04,458
And then also the mechanic and focusing on one thing

689
00:40:04,458 --> 00:40:07,420
that I found interesting.

690
00:40:08,659 --> 00:40:11,220
For me, this game is interesting because you

691
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,440
don't control an avatar.

692
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,221
You control a hole, which is negative space.

693
00:40:15,221 --> 00:40:17,882
And the entire game is physics driven.

694
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:21,104
So all these objects are physically simulated,

695
00:40:21,104 --> 00:40:25,125
and the characters have their own very simple, rudimentary AI.

696
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:28,807
And all you're doing is just playing with that system.

697
00:40:28,807 --> 00:40:30,587
And there's a couple puzzles, but a lot of it

698
00:40:30,587 --> 00:40:34,469
is just seeing what happens when you remove things from a scene

699
00:40:34,469 --> 00:40:36,550
and when you add them back and if they change or not.

700
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:43,722
And so the whole, so Brian Eno started in like pop music,

701
00:40:43,722 --> 00:40:46,663
and then he started to do ambient music

702
00:40:46,663 --> 00:40:47,964
and removed his own voice.

703
00:40:47,964 --> 00:40:49,484
And he thought removing his voice

704
00:40:49,484 --> 00:40:51,085
was really important to the work

705
00:40:51,085 --> 00:40:54,006
because the voice is, if you put a voice in music,

706
00:40:54,006 --> 00:40:55,947
it kind of focuses all your attention on it.

707
00:40:55,947 --> 00:40:59,709
And so this is his quote about removing the voice.

708
00:40:59,709 --> 00:41:01,770
He says, if I'm not there taking them through,

709
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:04,651
the audience, then it's an empty space for them.

710
00:41:04,651 --> 00:41:05,631
They can move into it.

711
00:41:06,552 --> 00:41:08,914
and they can go through in their own way.

712
00:41:08,914 --> 00:41:11,195
And so that's kind of a framework for me

713
00:41:11,195 --> 00:41:12,396
in terms of design.

714
00:41:12,396 --> 00:41:17,580
So in this case, I remove a lot of authorial control

715
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:20,522
in terms of the physics simulation.

716
00:41:20,522 --> 00:41:24,224
But I also remove your avatar and any kind of thing

717
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:28,047
to hold onto within that simulation.

718
00:41:28,047 --> 00:41:30,628
And I think it allows you to kind of be

719
00:41:30,628 --> 00:41:31,849
inside of that system.

720
00:41:33,404 --> 00:41:37,568
instantly, rather than having to rely on a lot of narrative

721
00:41:37,568 --> 00:41:41,572
immersion that I don't think is necessarily important.

722
00:41:41,572 --> 00:41:43,874
So I wanted to talk one more time about the Windows 95

723
00:41:43,874 --> 00:41:46,817
sound, how it encapsulates everything.

724
00:41:47,582 --> 00:41:52,126
So the challenge was to create this three and one-fourth

725
00:41:52,126 --> 00:41:54,127
second song.

726
00:41:54,127 --> 00:41:57,070
And so he said, this was really funny,

727
00:41:57,070 --> 00:42:00,393
because to make that piece of music that

728
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:05,777
contained all those ideas was an incredibly silly challenge.

729
00:42:05,777 --> 00:42:08,119
But he took it up.

730
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:14,005
So and he used these three ideas of having a guiding theory,

731
00:42:14,005 --> 00:42:15,486
having an incredibly.

732
00:42:15,912 --> 00:42:18,554
incredibly rigid constraint of three seconds,

733
00:42:18,554 --> 00:42:21,798
although he did produce this song that was six seconds.

734
00:42:21,798 --> 00:42:24,220
But also that his reaction to it,

735
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:27,283
his gut reaction of it being kind of like a ridiculous idea,

736
00:42:27,283 --> 00:42:30,066
helped guide him towards producing

737
00:42:30,066 --> 00:42:34,250
like much more interesting work, because he never would have

738
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,773
explored that kind of like super compressed time

739
00:42:36,773 --> 00:42:38,114
space without that.

740
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:42,509
So I'm Ben Esposito again.

741
00:42:42,509 --> 00:42:43,089
This is my Twitter.

742
00:42:43,089 --> 00:42:46,532
If you want to talk to me about some more materials, like

743
00:42:46,532 --> 00:42:48,854
documentaries and interviews and stuff, I'd be totally

744
00:42:48,854 --> 00:42:49,454
happy to share.

745
00:42:49,454 --> 00:42:50,555
So thank you very much.

746
00:42:50,555 --> 00:42:59,042
All right.

747
00:42:59,042 --> 00:43:01,604
And next up, we've got Brenda Romero.

748
00:43:03,398 --> 00:43:06,560
serious OG in the game industry. 32 years

749
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:11,023
inside and out games that are plugged in and are not plugged in.

750
00:43:11,023 --> 00:43:17,348
An amazing variety of work. Right now she's the program director at UC Santa Cruz

751
00:43:17,348 --> 00:43:27,655
Masters Program in Games and Playable Media. Come on up Brenda.

752
00:43:27,655 --> 00:43:28,096
Hi everybody.

753
00:43:28,096 --> 00:43:29,877
I'm gonna move this back.

754
00:43:30,493 --> 00:43:35,034
I talk fast. I've only had two cups of coffee this morning. It could be a little slower.

755
00:43:35,034 --> 00:43:38,215
Okay, it doesn't want to go back.

756
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:41,196
All right, so today I'm going to talk about Jackson Pollock.

757
00:43:41,196 --> 00:43:46,437
Jackson Pollock, he's a huge inspiration of mine. He's a painter.

758
00:43:46,437 --> 00:43:50,518
I'm not sure, actually, when I first become aware of Jackson Pollock.

759
00:43:50,518 --> 00:43:53,479
My guess is that even my first...

760
00:43:55,277 --> 00:44:01,060
knowledge that he even exists as an artist was probably not this, that Jackson Pollock was a great artist,

761
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:06,383
which is certainly something I believe today. My guess is that I heard about it like this,

762
00:44:06,383 --> 00:44:12,246
much more obviously. Jackson Pollock was someone who threw paint at a canvas and would have been excellent in Unfinished Swan, in fact.

763
00:44:12,526 --> 00:44:13,206
It's a nice setup.

764
00:44:13,206 --> 00:44:15,848
I don't know if you paired those together on purpose.

765
00:44:15,848 --> 00:44:18,369
But of course, anybody can make a Jackson Pollock painting.

766
00:44:18,369 --> 00:44:20,950
And we all know, good job, mom and dad.

767
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:23,691
You can do Jackson Pollock on your nails if you'd like to.

768
00:44:23,691 --> 00:44:25,612
The kids can do Jackson Pollock in the backyard.

769
00:44:25,612 --> 00:44:27,693
And there's this fucking idiot on YouTube

770
00:44:27,693 --> 00:44:30,214
telling how everybody can, this guy's such a tool,

771
00:44:30,214 --> 00:44:32,175
how everybody can be Jackson Pollock.

772
00:44:32,175 --> 00:44:35,317
And then you can have accidental Pollocks on your shoes

773
00:44:35,317 --> 00:44:37,037
if you really get involved in it.

774
00:44:37,037 --> 00:44:38,358
But absolutely none of them,

775
00:44:38,358 --> 00:44:40,499
so this is a piece called Number 11.

776
00:44:40,699 --> 00:44:48,204
Absolutely none of them has the beauty and the passion and the movement, the intensity of a real Pollock.

777
00:44:48,204 --> 00:44:55,708
A real Pollock is breathtaking. A real Pollock can bring me literally to tears just being there in their presence.

778
00:44:55,708 --> 00:44:57,109
They're beautiful, beautiful works.

779
00:44:57,109 --> 00:45:02,532
And when I first start to study Pollock, it's not a way you would think, but it's through level design.

780
00:45:03,132 --> 00:45:05,513
And let me tell you why.

781
00:45:05,513 --> 00:45:10,076
It occurs to me that Pollock's process is not unlike a game designer's process.

782
00:45:10,076 --> 00:45:12,977
He's circling the canvas again and again,

783
00:45:12,977 --> 00:45:15,478
much like we might circle a level again and again,

784
00:45:15,478 --> 00:45:17,199
fine-tuning it here or there,

785
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:20,881
creating the actual thing, the exact thing that we hope to create.

786
00:45:21,341 --> 00:45:24,464
And as he's moving around the canvas, so are we.

787
00:45:24,464 --> 00:45:29,228
Our canvas, of course, comes in a whole variety of different ways, be it digital or non-digital.

788
00:45:29,228 --> 00:45:33,272
And what we're looking at when we see a Pollock painting isn't so much a painting,

789
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:36,195
but the artifact of a painting experience.

790
00:45:36,195 --> 00:45:42,000
And to me, I feel like a game is an artifact of a game designer's play experience.

791
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,065
And the thing I love about Pollock is Pollock was the fucking paint.

792
00:45:46,065 --> 00:45:50,290
He was literally the pedal to the metal. It doesn't get any better than that.

793
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:52,452
He isolated and elevated the paint.

794
00:45:52,452 --> 00:45:58,299
If you see a painting of a house, if you see paintings of people, you see paintings of angels, whatever,

795
00:45:58,299 --> 00:46:02,504
you've lost sight of the purity of the paint. That's what he deeply cares about.

796
00:46:04,298 --> 00:46:06,780
And for me, Pollock was all about action.

797
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:10,102
It was all about the movement, the motion, the depth,

798
00:46:10,102 --> 00:46:11,203
the rage and the joy.

799
00:46:11,203 --> 00:46:14,105
In every single line of a Pollock painting,

800
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:15,947
you can see how he was feeling.

801
00:46:15,947 --> 00:46:18,769
You can see, it's just like I mentioned before,

802
00:46:18,769 --> 00:46:21,031
an artifact of his painting experience.

803
00:46:21,031 --> 00:46:23,152
And the paint, even when it's dry,

804
00:46:23,152 --> 00:46:25,174
even when Pollock is long since dead,

805
00:46:25,174 --> 00:46:27,135
even when it's hanging on a museum wall,

806
00:46:27,135 --> 00:46:29,117
the painting is as real.

807
00:46:29,117 --> 00:46:30,398
It is still as moving.

808
00:46:30,398 --> 00:46:32,960
It's still as alive as it was before.

809
00:46:33,734 --> 00:46:36,416
And for me, Pollock is as pure as it gets,

810
00:46:36,416 --> 00:46:38,478
as far as painting goes.

811
00:46:38,478 --> 00:46:40,720
And Pollock is also super alone.

812
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,321
This is a piece called Number 9A.

813
00:46:42,321 --> 00:46:46,164
And Pollock, when he was doing this,

814
00:46:46,164 --> 00:46:47,565
nobody else was doing these things.

815
00:46:47,565 --> 00:46:49,807
I mean, granted, there was a lot of abstract expressionism

816
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:52,409
happening and those were who his peers were

817
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:54,250
in the New York scene,

818
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:57,833
but he wasn't doing this with lots of other people.

819
00:46:57,833 --> 00:46:59,674
In fact, he was not doing it with anybody.

820
00:46:59,674 --> 00:47:03,197
And he faced harsh criticism from his contemporaries.

821
00:47:03,297 --> 00:47:07,800
This particular line, it is easy to detect the following things in all of his paintings.

822
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,282
This is an Italian critic in Time Magazine.

823
00:47:10,282 --> 00:47:15,966
Chaos, absolute lack of harmony, complete lack of structural organization, total absence of technique,

824
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:18,408
however rudimentary, once again chaos.

825
00:47:18,408 --> 00:47:24,932
If this had been a review in GameSpot, it would have been a zero out of ten.

826
00:47:24,932 --> 00:47:28,335
And so Pollock replied to the author and just wrote, no chaos, damn it.

827
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:34,763
You know, maybe at the time, Pollock actually, you know, as much as he faced criticism,

828
00:47:34,763 --> 00:47:39,787
and in part he just felt really alone because nobody was doing what he was doing.

829
00:47:39,787 --> 00:47:43,009
And he, so he actually had a lot of supporters, including Peggy Guggenheim,

830
00:47:43,009 --> 00:47:46,811
and a lot of prominent critics who were saying, this guy's on to something.

831
00:47:46,811 --> 00:47:49,873
But he still never felt secure in his work, ever.

832
00:47:50,327 --> 00:47:54,691
And then he got a break that many of us as game developers would kill for.

833
00:47:54,691 --> 00:47:58,855
Life Magazine ran an article in 1949 asking if he was the greatest painter in the United States.

834
00:47:58,855 --> 00:48:03,980
And whatever your profession is, is John Sharp the greatest game designer in the United States?

835
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:07,724
And of course there'd be this moment where you'd think like...

836
00:48:07,844 --> 00:48:09,164
That's me mentioned in time,

837
00:48:09,164 --> 00:48:11,165
I'm going to immediately show my parents, right?

838
00:48:11,165 --> 00:48:14,405
But then, there's the other 100 people in the room

839
00:48:14,405 --> 00:48:17,726
who are going, John Sharp's not the greatest game designer

840
00:48:17,726 --> 00:48:20,167
in the United States, what the hell is this?

841
00:48:20,167 --> 00:48:21,707
I'm gonna go to Twitter and start, you know?

842
00:48:21,707 --> 00:48:25,048
So for him, fortunately he didn't have Twitter, right?

843
00:48:25,048 --> 00:48:27,328
He didn't have to deal with Twitter rage.

844
00:48:27,328 --> 00:48:28,909
But this is what the real world,

845
00:48:28,909 --> 00:48:32,229
of course my perfectly scientific estimation there,

846
00:48:32,229 --> 00:48:33,590
Pollack got a lot of praise,

847
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:36,850
but the way he really saw it was much more like this.

848
00:48:37,222 --> 00:48:42,846
And because he painted the drip method from 1947 until 1951,

849
00:48:42,846 --> 00:48:48,310
and at the peak of his fame, he walked away from it.

850
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:49,490
So when people had known him,

851
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:53,293
when they actually revered the work that he was doing,

852
00:48:53,293 --> 00:48:55,575
when people who said anybody could make a Pollock

853
00:48:55,575 --> 00:48:57,636
actually tried to reproduce a Pollock

854
00:48:57,636 --> 00:49:00,098
and tried to get in there some of the mathematical movements

855
00:49:00,098 --> 00:49:01,859
and moments that are in his paintings,

856
00:49:01,859 --> 00:49:03,160
they were unable to do it.

857
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,861
And so at the peak of his style, he walked away.

858
00:49:07,051 --> 00:49:10,572
Pollock was an alcoholic, he'd been sober for a while,

859
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:12,613
but he resumed drinking at some point,

860
00:49:12,613 --> 00:49:15,274
and within six years he died.

861
00:49:15,274 --> 00:49:18,675
He created another, he tried to mess around

862
00:49:18,675 --> 00:49:20,095
with a lot of different styles,

863
00:49:20,095 --> 00:49:22,316
but man, none of them had the beauty,

864
00:49:22,316 --> 00:49:24,377
the intensity, and the purity.

865
00:49:24,377 --> 00:49:27,578
None of them had the hymn, none of them had the Jackson

866
00:49:27,578 --> 00:49:31,879
that those four beautiful years had.

867
00:49:33,046 --> 00:49:38,247
This is a piece, when I was at a really fucked up point in my life, a lot of bad shit had happened.

868
00:49:38,247 --> 00:49:43,028
And I'd finished my level design study of Pollock quite a while before.

869
00:49:43,028 --> 00:49:46,769
And I was at a really fucked up point in my life, like I said, a lot of bad shit had happened.

870
00:49:46,769 --> 00:49:49,189
And there's this painting, it's called The Deep.

871
00:49:49,189 --> 00:49:52,450
And to this day, I don't know why I would stare at this painting.

872
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:54,710
It's part of my process as a game designer.

873
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:55,750
I just stare at shit.

874
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:58,051
I am working, goddammit.

875
00:49:58,411 --> 00:50:02,633
But I would stare at this painting and I think, like, am I looking at the white?

876
00:50:02,633 --> 00:50:04,374
Am I trying to see what's through it?

877
00:50:04,374 --> 00:50:07,175
You know, what's happening in this painting?

878
00:50:07,175 --> 00:50:13,178
And to this day, you know, there's a lot of blue poles is often thought of,

879
00:50:13,178 --> 00:50:14,939
which is number 11 I showed you before.

880
00:50:14,939 --> 00:50:17,300
It's often thought of as one of his best pieces.

881
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,941
But to me, this is his most nuanced piece, man.

882
00:50:19,941 --> 00:50:21,122
It's just him and white and black.

883
00:50:21,122 --> 00:50:22,342
And it is just breathtaking.

884
00:50:22,502 --> 00:50:27,285
And I still don't even know really what it means, but it was at this very low point in my life.

885
00:50:27,285 --> 00:50:31,608
And out of that low point in my life came a series of games that I'm still working on now.

886
00:50:31,608 --> 00:50:33,910
This is one of them called Train.

887
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:38,593
And I wasn't intending, I was just doing these things because I had to, because I still have to.

888
00:50:39,134 --> 00:50:41,955
And for me, maybe this is what it looked like.

889
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:43,596
Maybe, like, even as I put this up here,

890
00:50:43,596 --> 00:50:45,877
I'm suffering a whole hell of a lot of imposter syndrome

891
00:50:45,877 --> 00:50:47,097
with the word amazing.

892
00:50:47,097 --> 00:50:49,518
So let's just put the word work there.

893
00:50:49,518 --> 00:50:50,559
And stop making games.

894
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:52,260
And that was some stuff people said.

895
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:55,021
You know, Brenda Brathwaite, which was my name at the time,

896
00:50:55,021 --> 00:50:56,882
you need to stop making games.

897
00:50:56,882 --> 00:50:57,582
You're hurting games.

898
00:50:57,582 --> 00:51:00,303
And so it looked like that, probably,

899
00:51:00,303 --> 00:51:02,865
but it felt a whole hell of a lot like that.

900
00:51:02,865 --> 00:51:05,806
And the detractors seemed so incredibly loud.

901
00:51:06,046 --> 00:51:09,108
And so what at one point in time was me studying Pollock

902
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:11,709
and looking at how his work could influence

903
00:51:11,709 --> 00:51:14,271
the work of level design in general,

904
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:17,232
then somehow turned to be about me researching

905
00:51:17,232 --> 00:51:19,854
what I would need to know about Pollock many years later

906
00:51:19,854 --> 00:51:22,355
when I was at a breaking point.

907
00:51:22,355 --> 00:51:26,217
And Pollock, he became my inspiration and my support.

908
00:51:27,063 --> 00:51:31,647
Pollock felt about paint the way I felt and still feel about game mechanics.

909
00:51:31,647 --> 00:51:34,830
And this is one of my favorite quotes of his.

910
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:38,994
On the floor I am more at ease. I feel nearer more a part of the painting,

911
00:51:38,994 --> 00:51:45,841
since I can walk around it, work from the four sides, and literally be in the painting.

912
00:51:45,841 --> 00:51:47,162
What the hell happened there?

913
00:51:47,162 --> 00:51:50,906
Okay, just the, so it's supposed to...

914
00:51:50,906 --> 00:51:52,307
There it is. That's art. Do it.

915
00:51:53,125 --> 00:51:57,669
I'm supposed to say I'm on the table. I'm more at ease. I feel nearer to the game.

916
00:51:57,669 --> 00:52:02,473
And this way I can walk around the work from all four sides and literally be in the game.

917
00:52:02,473 --> 00:52:08,098
And I remember when the PS4 conference happened, the big event, and I had this horrible feeling.

918
00:52:08,338 --> 00:52:11,281
I was saying to my husband, I'm like, I should be there, why am I not there?

919
00:52:11,281 --> 00:52:19,671
And because I was not there, somehow I'm a failure, somehow I fucked up, somehow I'm not part of mainstream games, where I have been since the beginning.

920
00:52:19,671 --> 00:52:27,380
And I'm looking at the work that my friends are doing, and my friends' games are, you know, some of my closest, dearest friends are getting Game of the Year nods, you know?

921
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,601
and I'm not doing this. I'm doing something that doesn't even match a box that they're in.

922
00:52:31,601 --> 00:52:35,723
And I feel like I'm outside of the actual game industry, right?

923
00:52:35,723 --> 00:52:40,185
Instead of thinking, maybe I'm pushing the fucking boundaries of the edge of that industry.

924
00:52:40,185 --> 00:52:45,727
And Kropotkin tells me that it's okay to be there, right? Like, it's absolutely okay to be outside.

925
00:52:45,727 --> 00:52:49,069
I'm not missing anything by not being at the PS4 launch event.

926
00:52:49,669 --> 00:52:53,751
And I find myself again and again referencing him when people say,

927
00:52:53,751 --> 00:52:56,672
well you have to make copies of Train, you have to.

928
00:52:56,672 --> 00:52:56,952
No I don't.

929
00:52:56,952 --> 00:52:58,993
No and I'm still not going to.

930
00:52:58,993 --> 00:53:02,254
Pollock's not making 20 lavender mists for all the housewives

931
00:53:02,254 --> 00:53:04,575
and househusbands who want it.

932
00:53:04,575 --> 00:53:10,297
Pollock, I love his brutal compression of exactly what it is he deeply loves.

933
00:53:10,297 --> 00:53:16,199
You know, I don't care so much about graphics and cut scenes or story or audio.

934
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:18,860
I just want to deal right now with the mechanics.

935
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:26,187
And there's something I'm still puzzling about with Pollock. He actually got rid of names at some point in his painting.

936
00:53:26,187 --> 00:53:33,394
And he called this number 11. He didn't even want the names to color what that paint could possibly be.

937
00:53:33,394 --> 00:53:37,938
He just wanted it as pure as it could conceivably be in his world.

938
00:53:37,938 --> 00:53:41,842
Pollock basically gives me permission.

939
00:53:41,902 --> 00:53:46,446
And he gives me permission to be here or to go even further if I want to.

940
00:53:46,446 --> 00:53:51,230
That I can do what I like to do and not worry about whether I'm going to be accepted.

941
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:55,054
And that it's all right to do stuff that none of my other peers are doing

942
00:53:55,054 --> 00:53:58,837
and that I don't necessarily need their approval or even my own

943
00:53:58,837 --> 00:54:03,201
because clearly I sometimes feel anxious about the stuff that I am working on.

944
00:54:03,201 --> 00:54:05,824
Pollock inspires me to match his dedication.

945
00:54:06,564 --> 00:54:13,528
He inspires me to think about painting, a painting, designing in ways that I've never designed before.

946
00:54:13,528 --> 00:54:19,311
He inspires me to keep going, to keep exploring, and to keep doing what I feel called to do.

947
00:54:19,311 --> 00:54:19,632
Thank you.

948
00:54:19,632 --> 00:54:35,741
Thank you, Brenda. That was great. Awesome. You should do this part.

949
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:43,609
Alright, so we talked a little bit about Brian Eno,

950
00:54:43,609 --> 00:54:45,669
Jackson Pollock, that's where he lives now,

951
00:54:45,669 --> 00:54:48,610
on that star after the wreck.

952
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:51,951
Of course, the Muppets.

953
00:54:51,951 --> 00:54:53,752
Nothing more important than the Muppets.

954
00:54:53,752 --> 00:54:58,273
George Saunders, the rave scene,

955
00:54:58,273 --> 00:55:00,214
Samuel Beckett, who I always want to call

956
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:04,855
either Thomas Aquinas or Thomas Beckett for some reason.

957
00:55:04,855 --> 00:55:06,135
I managed to do it correctly today.

958
00:55:07,913 --> 00:55:09,414
Realist Cinema, Jotto.

959
00:55:09,414 --> 00:55:11,616
But what about you all?

960
00:55:11,616 --> 00:55:14,918
What are your influences?

961
00:55:14,918 --> 00:55:17,659
What are the things that inspire you?

962
00:55:17,659 --> 00:55:19,560
If you take anything away from this,

963
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:23,183
I think it's go back and think about something

964
00:55:23,183 --> 00:55:25,664
that isn't a game that's really meaningful in your work

965
00:55:25,664 --> 00:55:28,246
and how can you bring that into the process?

966
00:55:28,246 --> 00:55:30,907
How can that help change you

967
00:55:30,907 --> 00:55:32,848
and make you better as a developer?

968
00:55:32,848 --> 00:55:35,990
So thanks very much you all.

969
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:36,611
Thanks everybody.
