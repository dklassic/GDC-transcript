1
00:00:12,491 --> 00:00:18,716
My name is Yngve, and I run a small studio called Henchmen & Goon out of Bergen, which

2
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:22,079
is a very wet city in the western part of Norway.

3
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,325
I'm first and foremost a visual artist, and I originally come from traditional art, but

4
00:00:28,485 --> 00:00:31,027
I ended up in games because games are cool.

5
00:00:33,015 --> 00:00:38,580
I'm still an artist though, and I went and got myself a degree in concept art a bunch of years ago.

6
00:00:38,861 --> 00:00:42,844
The main difference now is that I work in a team, which I really enjoy.

7
00:00:42,864 --> 00:00:50,371
11-ish years ago, I co-founded Henchmen & Goon with a fairly large group of friends,

8
00:00:51,192 --> 00:00:52,133
mostly right out of uni.

9
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:57,093
Since then, we've launched three games, Flem,

10
00:00:57,173 --> 00:00:59,994
which is a small 2D platformer for PC, Pod,

11
00:01:00,054 --> 00:01:02,496
which is the biggest and most ambitious game we've launched

12
00:01:02,576 --> 00:01:06,618
so far for PC and console, and Pod Kids,

13
00:01:06,698 --> 00:01:08,599
which is an activity app for children,

14
00:01:08,639 --> 00:01:10,781
which we launched on Google Play last summer.

15
00:01:12,462 --> 00:01:16,344
We're also currently, we have three games in progress

16
00:01:16,484 --> 00:01:18,605
at different stages, but I'm not going to talk

17
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:19,426
about any of those.

18
00:01:19,506 --> 00:01:21,006
I'm gonna talk a little bit about Pod.

19
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:29,254
We started working on PODE in 2015, roughly three years after we founded Henchmen & Goon,

20
00:01:29,534 --> 00:01:31,135
and we spent three years making it.

21
00:01:32,575 --> 00:01:36,897
For most of the time, we were about four people working on it, with the addition of one or

22
00:01:36,917 --> 00:01:42,460
two people from time to time, until the last six months of development, when we were fortunate

23
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,942
enough to be able to grow our team to seven people for the remaining development, plus

24
00:01:47,122 --> 00:01:48,263
audio and music people.

25
00:01:50,023 --> 00:01:55,086
Pod launched on Nintendo Switch in June of 2018, and it tanked.

26
00:01:56,387 --> 00:02:01,050
We were so disappointed, and fair to say that summer wasn't particularly fun for any of

27
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:01,250
us.

28
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:06,373
But things ended up turning around, and I'm going to get back to that a little bit later.

29
00:02:08,314 --> 00:02:12,376
Before I continue, I want to go back a little and tell you a bit about where I come from.

30
00:02:13,495 --> 00:02:19,240
I grew up in a family of artists, musicians, actors, and all sorts of creative people.

31
00:02:19,721 --> 00:02:24,526
I have been making art for as long as I can remember, and the idea of artistic success

32
00:02:24,586 --> 00:02:26,728
has been present in my life just as long.

33
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:31,873
I decided very early that I wanted to live off my art, and as soon as that becomes an

34
00:02:32,073 --> 00:02:36,878
option, you also start looking at what it means to be a successful or a failed artist.

35
00:02:38,393 --> 00:02:41,634
And you get sort of competitive and protective of your art,

36
00:02:41,714 --> 00:02:43,854
your style, and your idea of what

37
00:02:43,894 --> 00:02:45,295
a successful artist might be.

38
00:02:46,695 --> 00:02:48,036
I'm no different from anyone else,

39
00:02:48,216 --> 00:02:50,677
so I certainly went through that whole phase

40
00:02:50,717 --> 00:02:53,197
of being a young, arrogant, pretentious artist.

41
00:02:54,138 --> 00:02:55,858
I identified myself with the idea

42
00:02:56,018 --> 00:02:57,839
of what I thought an artist should be.

43
00:02:58,379 --> 00:02:59,799
And to be honest, when we're young,

44
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:02,960
we often get those ideas by looking at the cliches.

45
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:09,231
One of those cliches is the notion that you should suffer for your art.

46
00:03:10,072 --> 00:03:12,192
You should pour all of yourself into your art.

47
00:03:12,612 --> 00:03:16,833
Don't let regular life come in the way of artistic greatness and all that nonsense.

48
00:03:18,274 --> 00:03:22,195
And when someone suggests that you may need to pay attention to something other than the

49
00:03:22,315 --> 00:03:28,016
art, like getting a paying job, sometimes we can kind of get a little bit defensive.

50
00:03:29,036 --> 00:03:32,757
Why should I have to do anything but create art from the depths of my soul, right?

51
00:03:36,038 --> 00:03:39,879
My mom never had the patience for any of that, so she simply told me,

52
00:03:39,899 --> 00:03:42,601
Ingvild, artists too need to eat.

53
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:47,062
Now you can take that statement literally, we all need to eat, we know this.

54
00:03:48,123 --> 00:03:51,324
But in the context that this was said, it meant a lot more than that.

55
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:58,567
It meant that I wasn't different from anyone else, and we all need to do what it takes to function as humans.

56
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:05,430
Both with regards to our physical needs, and as part of the society that we live in.

57
00:04:07,102 --> 00:04:09,003
We can't simply decide to be something

58
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:11,325
and claim the privilege to be released

59
00:04:11,365 --> 00:04:13,146
from all other responsibilities.

60
00:04:14,127 --> 00:04:15,908
So artists too need to eat.

61
00:04:16,249 --> 00:04:19,611
That statement from my mom kind of pulled me down to earth

62
00:04:19,711 --> 00:04:21,353
at a time where I needed that to happen.

63
00:04:22,674 --> 00:04:25,196
It stuck with me and I brought that with me

64
00:04:25,356 --> 00:04:26,837
into everything I've done since,

65
00:04:27,077 --> 00:04:28,899
including starting up Henchmen & Goon,

66
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:31,801
which becomes important later in the story.

67
00:04:33,902 --> 00:04:36,545
So fast forward again to the founding of Henchmen & Goon.

68
00:04:38,188 --> 00:04:42,189
Like I mentioned, we were mostly right out of uni when we started Henchman & Goon.

69
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:46,932
Some of us had been freelancing for a bit, and we knew a little bit about running a small

70
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:51,834
business, but for the most part, we were kind of oblivious to what setting off on this adventure

71
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:52,254
would mean.

72
00:04:54,235 --> 00:04:57,516
We had a bunch of reasons why we wanted to run our own studio.

73
00:04:58,462 --> 00:04:59,902
We wanted creative freedom.

74
00:05:00,542 --> 00:05:04,263
We all had our own ideas that we wanted to see realized.

75
00:05:04,883 --> 00:05:07,044
We wanted to keep working with each other, with our friends.

76
00:05:07,684 --> 00:05:09,684
And we wanted to build something for ourselves.

77
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:14,166
However, first and foremost, we wanted to make games,

78
00:05:14,486 --> 00:05:16,586
and there were no local jobs available.

79
00:05:16,926 --> 00:05:19,287
Not just jobs, there were hardly any studios

80
00:05:19,427 --> 00:05:20,267
where I come from.

81
00:05:21,648 --> 00:05:24,868
So starting our own studio was basically our only choice

82
00:05:25,068 --> 00:05:27,449
if we wanted to stay in our hometown.

83
00:05:27,987 --> 00:05:29,167
without giving up on our dreams.

84
00:05:39,354 --> 00:05:42,737
So there we were, a whole bunch of really inexperienced game

85
00:05:42,757 --> 00:05:44,438
developers deciding to go pro.

86
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:47,200
Where do you begin with something like that?

87
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,282
Well, making a plan seems like a good way to start.

88
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:53,952
And the first thing on this plan is to survive.

89
00:05:54,652 --> 00:05:57,293
Making art, making games, takes time.

90
00:05:57,473 --> 00:05:59,553
So in order to do that, we needed

91
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:00,774
to survive in the meantime.

92
00:06:01,854 --> 00:06:04,534
We spent the first three years doing contract work

93
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,835
and having jobs on the side.

94
00:06:06,235 --> 00:06:08,115
And by contract work, I mean stuff

95
00:06:08,155 --> 00:06:10,616
like designing menus for local restaurants

96
00:06:10,816 --> 00:06:12,476
and making book covers and stuff like that,

97
00:06:13,616 --> 00:06:16,637
all the while making a tiny little game for ourselves

98
00:06:16,697 --> 00:06:17,517
in the moments between.

99
00:06:19,652 --> 00:06:22,313
We were okay with this because we knew we had a plan.

100
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,314
We were working towards a goal,

101
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:26,796
and the ultimate goal was no contract work,

102
00:06:27,316 --> 00:06:28,757
all in-house games all the way.

103
00:06:30,138 --> 00:06:33,219
Anyway, we finally launched Phlegm almost three years

104
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,740
after we founded Henchmen & Goon.

105
00:06:36,081 --> 00:06:38,222
We sort of expected there to be some profit here.

106
00:06:38,863 --> 00:06:40,003
We made the calculations,

107
00:06:40,263 --> 00:06:42,445
and based on the tiny budget that we spent,

108
00:06:42,565 --> 00:06:44,386
we figured that it wouldn't take many sales

109
00:06:44,426 --> 00:06:46,907
for us to recoup and make a little bit extra.

110
00:06:48,443 --> 00:06:50,345
That didn't happen, of course, but it

111
00:06:50,385 --> 00:06:51,806
wasn't a huge disappointment.

112
00:06:53,087 --> 00:06:56,290
We made and we shipped something, and that felt good.

113
00:06:57,471 --> 00:06:59,152
It had also been a bit of an experiment

114
00:06:59,212 --> 00:07:00,573
to make something for ourselves.

115
00:07:01,074 --> 00:07:03,376
So we took it as a learning experience

116
00:07:03,596 --> 00:07:04,777
and kept moving forward.

117
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:10,001
However, we were no longer in the honeymoon phase.

118
00:07:10,241 --> 00:07:13,023
So we had to start thinking of what direction to take.

119
00:07:14,363 --> 00:07:17,225
People were getting a bit tired of having to work on the side.

120
00:07:17,885 --> 00:07:20,207
We'd started some other projects that didn't pan out.

121
00:07:20,487 --> 00:07:22,288
It was difficult getting project funding,

122
00:07:22,428 --> 00:07:24,289
and there was an increasing disagreement

123
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:27,131
of where to focus our energy in the studio.

124
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:30,453
We'd started to build a pretty good customer

125
00:07:30,473 --> 00:07:32,474
base with all the contract work we'd been doing,

126
00:07:32,934 --> 00:07:34,775
and some of the founders discovered

127
00:07:34,815 --> 00:07:36,956
that they were more interested in moving

128
00:07:37,016 --> 00:07:39,298
towards software development than game development.

129
00:07:40,922 --> 00:07:43,402
We'd gotten some bigger, more serious clients over the years.

130
00:07:43,682 --> 00:07:45,643
And there was the prospect of delivering

131
00:07:45,683 --> 00:07:48,964
some quite interesting solutions to the offshore sector, which

132
00:07:49,024 --> 00:07:50,684
can be quite lucrative business to be in.

133
00:07:51,965 --> 00:07:54,005
So at this point, we decided that we

134
00:07:54,045 --> 00:07:56,526
would be better off splitting the company in half,

135
00:07:56,686 --> 00:07:59,387
instead of having two groups within the company pulling

136
00:07:59,407 --> 00:08:00,307
in different directions.

137
00:08:01,968 --> 00:08:02,748
And that's what we did.

138
00:08:03,128 --> 00:08:03,708
No drama.

139
00:08:03,808 --> 00:08:04,948
It was all very friendly.

140
00:08:04,968 --> 00:08:07,369
We even stayed in the same offices,

141
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:09,250
sharing people and projects when we needed to.

142
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,466
Those who stayed started working on PODE

143
00:08:12,706 --> 00:08:14,627
while continuing doing commissions

144
00:08:14,747 --> 00:08:15,888
and having jobs on the side.

145
00:08:16,548 --> 00:08:18,689
And we just kept working towards that end goal

146
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:21,991
that was still no commissions, all full-time in-house work.

147
00:08:24,993 --> 00:08:27,314
We'd been working on finding external funding

148
00:08:27,354 --> 00:08:29,716
for various projects since starting Henchman and Goon.

149
00:08:31,198 --> 00:08:33,400
It was about four years since we founded the company,

150
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,441
and we were still doing all the things

151
00:08:35,501 --> 00:08:37,323
that we thought we wouldn't do anymore.

152
00:08:37,963 --> 00:08:40,184
Commissions, jobs on the side, and all that stuff

153
00:08:40,224 --> 00:08:41,465
that wasn't making games.

154
00:08:43,867 --> 00:08:45,208
We were still living hand to mouth,

155
00:08:45,388 --> 00:08:47,849
and still had no profit to show for it,

156
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,290
but we didn't have nothing.

157
00:08:50,171 --> 00:08:51,172
We had built some value.

158
00:08:51,912 --> 00:08:53,773
We had built a solid team of people

159
00:08:53,813 --> 00:08:56,075
who cared about each other and worked well together.

160
00:08:56,895 --> 00:08:59,157
We had proof we could finish and ship projects.

161
00:09:00,142 --> 00:09:04,684
We had spent a lot of time building a large network of people who supported and believed in us,

162
00:09:05,524 --> 00:09:09,825
and all that hard work resulted in project funding that enabled us to finish Pod.

163
00:09:11,065 --> 00:09:14,547
We still had to do some work on the side and hustle for more funding from time to time,

164
00:09:14,627 --> 00:09:18,788
but we got to spend three years mostly focusing on finishing our project.

165
00:09:20,008 --> 00:09:23,489
They were three years of joy, tears, stress, and excitement.

166
00:09:24,349 --> 00:09:29,291
And that feeling when you ship something you've agonized over for years is indescribable.

167
00:09:31,412 --> 00:09:33,153
So when it doesn't turn out the way you expect,

168
00:09:33,393 --> 00:09:35,855
it's absolutely heartbreakingly devastating.

169
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:39,638
The story that we're often told as developers

170
00:09:39,798 --> 00:09:41,540
is that a game has to sell more than 10,000, 20,000,

171
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,423
or whatever number of copies at launch to be a success.

172
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,906
And by success, we of course mean recouping

173
00:09:49,966 --> 00:09:50,767
and making a profit.

174
00:09:52,128 --> 00:09:54,169
So much time and resources and love

175
00:09:54,229 --> 00:09:56,811
had gone into this project compared to any other we'd done.

176
00:09:57,292 --> 00:09:59,894
And the feeling of failure was on a whole other level.

177
00:10:01,254 --> 00:10:04,935
We told ourselves that this would be the thing that pushed us over the hill.

178
00:10:05,715 --> 00:10:08,636
Everything would get easier if we just got to that launch date.

179
00:10:10,356 --> 00:10:11,296
But it wasn't just that.

180
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:14,897
This project included a lot more people than just ourselves.

181
00:10:15,678 --> 00:10:19,879
We had employees and investors and partners with royalty agreements

182
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:21,579
who all depended on us.

183
00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:26,860
So the feeling of failure was accompanied by the feeling of letting all these people down.

184
00:10:28,088 --> 00:10:30,430
And it's almost like dealing with a loss.

185
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:34,913
You put all your love and energy into creating something

186
00:10:34,953 --> 00:10:38,296
beautiful, and then it dies the moment it comes into the world.

187
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,559
So you start second guessing yourself

188
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:45,301
and wonder whether there's any point to continue.

189
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,803
Are we really supposed to suffer this much for our art?

190
00:10:50,264 --> 00:10:53,306
However, we've been doing this for six years at this point.

191
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:57,435
And while we contemplated whether or not we had a future,

192
00:10:58,015 --> 00:10:58,736
we did what we knew.

193
00:10:59,356 --> 00:11:00,837
We went back to doing commissions.

194
00:11:00,937 --> 00:11:02,277
We started a new project.

195
00:11:02,738 --> 00:11:03,818
We took jobs on the side.

196
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:06,159
We just went back to surviving.

197
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,582
And while we survived, something peculiar started to happen.

198
00:11:14,304 --> 00:11:16,144
The expectations when you launch a game

199
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:20,046
is that you'll sell a lot in the first few weeks or maybe months.

200
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:22,167
And then you'll see a large drop off.

201
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,763
So when you have bad numbers in those first few weeks,

202
00:11:26,044 --> 00:11:27,586
you expect it to drop to nothing,

203
00:11:28,086 --> 00:11:30,029
and that recoup is a far-gone dream.

204
00:11:31,551 --> 00:11:35,355
What we saw happening with PODE was hardly any drop off at all.

205
00:11:36,357 --> 00:11:39,100
And after some time, we figured that if this continued,

206
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,403
we might just hit that recoup milestone yet.

207
00:11:53,786 --> 00:11:57,408
So now we kind of had to regroup and figure out the way forward again.

208
00:11:58,948 --> 00:12:01,049
But we also shifted our perspective a bit,

209
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,951
and we started thinking in way of priorities instead of plans.

210
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:09,713
We'd been doing the same thing over and over for years, and it wasn't working.

211
00:12:10,473 --> 00:12:13,495
Well, it was sort of working. We were still alive. But the question was,

212
00:12:14,115 --> 00:12:17,797
do we want to spend all our time chasing some idea

213
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:21,178
of success while surviving disappointment after disappointment?

214
00:12:22,254 --> 00:12:25,317
So we got a little introspective and looked at what we had instead.

215
00:12:26,978 --> 00:12:29,120
We had a team of friends who cared about each other.

216
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:32,904
We had a community that believed in us and wanted to support us.

217
00:12:33,784 --> 00:12:39,770
We had a company and project we cared about, and we had the desire to make games together.

218
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,620
And we came up with this new list of priorities.

219
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,562
So this sounds very clear cut, of course, which it wasn't.

220
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:49,203
It's not a shift from one day to another.

221
00:12:50,123 --> 00:12:51,544
But there was a shift in perspective

222
00:12:51,584 --> 00:12:55,286
that gradually led to a clearer and clearer way to prioritize.

223
00:12:56,347 --> 00:12:58,348
However, for simplicity's sake, we

224
00:12:58,368 --> 00:12:59,868
came up with a new list of priorities.

225
00:13:01,469 --> 00:13:02,810
We needed to survive, of course.

226
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,991
You can't make anything if your basic needs aren't met.

227
00:13:07,057 --> 00:13:10,340
Most importantly, we wanted to enjoy every day of our work

228
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,003
life while making beautiful art and fun and interesting games.

229
00:13:15,284 --> 00:13:17,726
And we didn't want to chase an imaginary thing that

230
00:13:17,866 --> 00:13:19,767
might come true sometime in the future.

231
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:23,690
So let me break down what this list means for us.

232
00:13:25,912 --> 00:13:26,412
Survival.

233
00:13:27,253 --> 00:13:29,515
To survive means to love and care for each other.

234
00:13:30,536 --> 00:13:32,217
It means that every person in the group

235
00:13:32,337 --> 00:13:34,559
works to create an environment where we all

236
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,700
feel safe and happy.

237
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,585
To feel safe and happy, people need a few basic things.

238
00:13:40,325 --> 00:13:42,405
They need a decent salary, food, and shelter.

239
00:13:43,285 --> 00:13:45,846
They need time for a social life, family, and friends.

240
00:13:47,086 --> 00:13:48,306
They need time for themselves.

241
00:13:49,126 --> 00:13:51,086
And they need to feel heard and valued.

242
00:13:52,147 --> 00:13:54,147
Sometimes that means slowing down development

243
00:13:54,207 --> 00:13:55,167
if it's taking a toll.

244
00:13:56,087 --> 00:13:58,748
It means we need to allow people to be unproductive.

245
00:13:59,728 --> 00:14:01,888
Sometimes we're all down and uninspired,

246
00:14:02,228 --> 00:14:05,089
and we need room to get through that so we can bounce back

247
00:14:05,229 --> 00:14:06,289
instead of burning out.

248
00:14:07,787 --> 00:14:10,508
And it means creating a space for people to be inspired

249
00:14:10,648 --> 00:14:12,269
and give their best when they can.

250
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:15,390
In other words, it means putting people first

251
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,530
and projects second.

252
00:14:19,111 --> 00:14:20,391
Enjoy life and make art.

253
00:14:21,412 --> 00:14:23,012
You've probably all heard the saying,

254
00:14:23,092 --> 00:14:25,453
life is what happens when you're busy making plans.

255
00:14:26,613 --> 00:14:28,394
And that's kind of what this point represents.

256
00:14:29,914 --> 00:14:32,695
The reason we got into game development in the first place

257
00:14:32,835 --> 00:14:36,356
was because we are creative people who like making things.

258
00:14:37,338 --> 00:14:40,319
It's what we spent our free time doing before we made it our jobs.

259
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:48,261
If the work becomes nothing more but time-pressed tasks on the way to finishing a product, and

260
00:14:48,281 --> 00:14:52,042
the bright spots of your career are the days you finish something, what's the point?

261
00:14:53,782 --> 00:14:58,484
However, if you love the thing you make and enjoy the process of making it, you'll look

262
00:14:58,524 --> 00:15:00,364
back and feel happy and accomplished.

263
00:15:01,554 --> 00:15:05,818
Another side of this is that all the work that comes after you launch something will

264
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,500
be much easier if you have this relationship with your work.

265
00:15:09,661 --> 00:15:14,645
Porting to new platforms, cultivating a community, marketing and PR, you'll be able to have fun

266
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:15,566
doing that stuff too.

267
00:15:18,028 --> 00:15:19,829
And lastly, let's see what happens.

268
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:24,893
The thing about disappointment is that it's really just a result of reality not living

269
00:15:25,514 --> 00:15:26,595
up to your expectations.

270
00:15:27,696 --> 00:15:31,138
If you manage your expectations, you're less likely to get disappointed.

271
00:15:32,193 --> 00:15:34,434
This doesn't mean that you shouldn't do what you can

272
00:15:34,494 --> 00:15:36,856
to have a successful launch, or that you should

273
00:15:36,876 --> 00:15:38,497
be a pessimist about everything.

274
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:41,539
It means you should have a plan for how

275
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:44,381
to proceed if that launch doesn't bring in the cash

276
00:15:44,441 --> 00:15:45,782
to solve all your problems.

277
00:15:46,783 --> 00:15:49,645
Have a plan for how to survive if everything fails,

278
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:53,908
for how to keep your people and yourself happy and safe

279
00:15:54,088 --> 00:15:55,309
in the face of disappointment.

280
00:15:56,708 --> 00:16:01,552
So while we focused on what we needed to do to survive and try to get better at just enjoying

281
00:16:01,612 --> 00:16:10,378
the work in the process, pod numbers kept getting better. In 2021, we had the best summer since

282
00:16:10,398 --> 00:16:16,843
launch. 2022 was even better, and we came back from summer vacation discovering that we had

283
00:16:16,903 --> 00:16:22,267
recouped ahead of our estimations. For reference, the first few years we saw about a 20% drop in

284
00:16:22,287 --> 00:16:22,848
sales from year to year.

285
00:16:25,645 --> 00:16:31,490
In 2022, we had a 26.5% increase compared to 2021.

286
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,532
And this trend looks like it's continuing into 2023.

287
00:16:37,855 --> 00:16:39,656
So now we're getting kind of confused, right?

288
00:16:39,716 --> 00:16:41,057
This isn't what's supposed to happen.

289
00:16:41,157 --> 00:16:42,959
It's not how things work, right?

290
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,601
So why are the numbers behaving this way?

291
00:16:48,412 --> 00:16:52,274
There are, of course, a number of things that we did to try to affect the numbers.

292
00:16:53,194 --> 00:16:54,895
We kept launching on new platforms.

293
00:16:55,635 --> 00:16:57,276
We set up community events.

294
00:16:57,576 --> 00:17:00,757
We were present at conventions and conferences.

295
00:17:01,337 --> 00:17:03,498
We set up discounts as often as we could.

296
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:09,081
And we tried to be generally active and responsive with regards to our online community.

297
00:17:10,221 --> 00:17:11,542
Nothing really groundbreaking, though.

298
00:17:11,762 --> 00:17:13,683
Basically just maintaining our product.

299
00:17:14,863 --> 00:17:16,724
So we tried to figure out what was happening here,

300
00:17:16,824 --> 00:17:19,205
because if there is a recipe for reproduction,

301
00:17:19,365 --> 00:17:20,445
that would be great, right?

302
00:17:22,445 --> 00:17:24,446
The conclusion we came to is that

303
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:26,166
we actually did make a good product,

304
00:17:26,867 --> 00:17:30,368
which almost sounds kind of dumb and self-congratulatory,

305
00:17:30,468 --> 00:17:32,788
but I'm building to a point, I promise.

306
00:17:34,889 --> 00:17:37,890
So PODE has a good metascore, good reviews,

307
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,190
good ratings, good feedback,

308
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,411
and an absolutely lovely community.

309
00:17:43,247 --> 00:17:46,950
The thing is that all of this is incredibly easy to overlook

310
00:17:47,431 --> 00:17:50,693
if you measure your success by copies sold and money made.

311
00:17:52,054 --> 00:17:54,897
It's easy to give up and to stop maintaining something

312
00:17:54,977 --> 00:17:56,238
that you think has failed.

313
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,220
And I think there are a lot of good games out there

314
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,762
that fall into that category.

315
00:18:03,947 --> 00:18:08,150
We all work in an industry that is notorious for pushing people to the brink.

316
00:18:08,451 --> 00:18:13,635
We are often so focused on these milestones and launch dates and sales numbers that we

317
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:16,838
forget why people choose to work in this industry in the first place.

318
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:22,123
And one of the reasons we're so good at pushing ourselves is because we're all so incredibly

319
00:18:22,183 --> 00:18:23,444
passionate about what we do.

320
00:18:24,888 --> 00:18:27,569
We want to keep doing it, we want to get better at it,

321
00:18:27,789 --> 00:18:30,470
we want to deliver, we want to have a work out there.

322
00:18:31,071 --> 00:18:32,851
We want our art to be recognized,

323
00:18:33,351 --> 00:18:35,092
and we're a bit too ready to suffer for it.

324
00:18:36,673 --> 00:18:38,833
And this is where I come back to what my mom told me,

325
00:18:39,213 --> 00:18:42,755
artists too need to eat, and what it represents for me.

326
00:18:43,935 --> 00:18:46,816
It helps me take a step back and remember

327
00:18:46,976 --> 00:18:49,717
that reaching these goals isn't work anything

328
00:18:49,997 --> 00:18:52,418
if I don't survive, or if it takes away

329
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:53,498
the joy of the process.

330
00:18:54,845 --> 00:18:58,246
The way we try to implement this in how we run our studio,

331
00:18:58,466 --> 00:19:00,486
and what I hope that you'll be able to take away

332
00:19:00,526 --> 00:19:04,147
from this talk, is set goals for your life,

333
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:05,207
not your products.

334
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:09,228
Enjoy the work, take care of yourself

335
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:10,509
and the people around you,

336
00:19:11,469 --> 00:19:12,909
and this one is the most important one.

337
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,550
Plan for a way to fail comfortably

338
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,311
so you don't feel like giving up

339
00:19:17,611 --> 00:19:20,451
just because things don't turn out the way you want,

340
00:19:20,511 --> 00:19:20,932
you hope to.

341
00:19:22,607 --> 00:19:24,749
And give yourself some slack, because you really,

342
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:28,113
really, really do not have to be number one to be a success.

343
00:19:29,995 --> 00:19:31,576
Thank you all so much for coming.

344
00:19:32,557 --> 00:19:34,799
I think we have time for questions if there are any.

345
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:37,582
Thank you.

346
00:19:37,602 --> 00:19:38,103
Thank you.

347
00:19:38,123 --> 00:19:39,264
Thank you.

348
00:19:39,464 --> 00:19:40,065
Thank you.

349
00:19:40,085 --> 00:19:41,306
Thank you.

350
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:46,831
Don't be shy.

351
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:52,146
OK, I'm moving on to, OK, one question here.

352
00:19:52,246 --> 00:19:52,446
Yeah?

353
00:19:52,546 --> 00:19:53,007
Yes.

354
00:19:53,647 --> 00:19:55,449
Thank you for the inspiring talk.

355
00:19:55,629 --> 00:20:00,014
And now with all these lessons, so what are you doing now?

356
00:20:00,274 --> 00:20:03,158
What's happening in the future with these takeaways?

357
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:06,081
What's happening with RStudio in the future?

358
00:20:07,087 --> 00:20:11,991
Yeah, well, like I said, we're working on three different projects right now, and one

359
00:20:12,031 --> 00:20:17,536
of these is our kind of main thing that we're trying to finish and get funded right now.

360
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:26,565
I think the way these things kind of affect that is that this project has, it's taken

361
00:20:26,605 --> 00:20:30,829
a lot longer for us to finish than we wanted it to because we've been very conscious.

362
00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:38,173
every step of the way, not to put too much pressure on the team and try to kind of take that step back and look at,

363
00:20:38,233 --> 00:20:42,395
okay, if things are moving too fast, if things are getting too difficult,

364
00:20:42,515 --> 00:20:47,638
then we need to put a break on things and figure out what we need to do before we move forward.

365
00:20:47,658 --> 00:20:56,083
Yeah. I guess I don't have a question. I just want to say congrats on being a success.

366
00:20:57,664 --> 00:20:58,444
Thank you so much.

367
00:21:03,176 --> 00:21:04,617
Yeah?

368
00:21:04,717 --> 00:21:10,922
Given what you know now about how PODE's sales kind of graph

369
00:21:11,022 --> 00:21:13,584
goes, would you have done anything different?

370
00:21:14,044 --> 00:21:16,186
Or what would you have done differently leading up

371
00:21:16,226 --> 00:21:17,187
to the launch of it?

372
00:21:18,628 --> 00:21:19,589
I think so.

373
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:24,673
I think one of the conclusions that we've come to is that

374
00:21:27,683 --> 00:21:35,967
We were a very young studio making this game, and it was our first really big project, and we decided to self-publish.

375
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:37,608
So we did everything ourselves.

376
00:21:38,488 --> 00:21:43,651
And of course, doing that, not knowing how to do things, you're bound to make some mistakes.

377
00:21:46,033 --> 00:21:48,716
What we would have done different now is to try to find,

378
00:21:48,936 --> 00:21:50,978
we would have probably have tried to find a publisher,

379
00:21:51,098 --> 00:21:54,061
even if it's someone that doesn't put money into the project,

380
00:21:54,121 --> 00:21:56,624
but finding someone who knows how to do a game launch

381
00:21:56,664 --> 00:21:57,925
and how to get visibility.

382
00:21:58,446 --> 00:22:02,009
Because, of course, if we'd had better numbers at launch

383
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:06,834
and imagining that the curve was the same,

384
00:22:06,954 --> 00:22:09,517
we still would have done better than what we actually did.

385
00:22:13,078 --> 00:22:14,499
I think you're next.

386
00:22:14,719 --> 00:22:16,539
Congratulations on your success.

387
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,180
Thank you.

388
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,920
You mentioned that one of your greatest assets

389
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,221
that you didn't realize you had, but you do now,

390
00:22:22,261 --> 00:22:24,362
was your community that supported you.

391
00:22:24,522 --> 00:22:25,742
How did you build that community?

392
00:22:28,063 --> 00:22:29,383
Stuff like this.

393
00:22:30,584 --> 00:22:34,245
It's been important to us to be kind of present at community

394
00:22:34,325 --> 00:22:34,725
events.

395
00:22:35,005 --> 00:22:37,566
So we've been working very hard to just

396
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:40,287
get to know everybody in the Norwegian game community.

397
00:22:40,972 --> 00:22:43,954
And also going to conferences and conventions.

398
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:50,138
And I think it's easy to, when you come to the point that

399
00:22:50,338 --> 00:22:53,079
you are a developer, you've released something, you've

400
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,640
done something, it's easy to kind of.

401
00:22:55,636 --> 00:23:04,544
ignore people who you look at as not as skilled or that haven't accomplished these things.

402
00:23:05,225 --> 00:23:11,851
And for us, it's always been very important to not ignore anyone, because you never know where

403
00:23:13,713 --> 00:23:16,436
wisdom comes from, basically. So welcome everybody.

404
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:31,080
who wants to be part of it and try to kind of just like be there for everyone, for your fans, for the players, and just for students, for whoever, like, let everybody be part of that journey, I think.

405
00:23:32,821 --> 00:23:45,324
Hey, thanks so much for the talk. My question is regarding kind of the dual priorities of wanting to maintain this really kind of healthy workspace where you can

406
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:48,257
kind of take things at the pace that you're able to in the moment,

407
00:23:48,337 --> 00:23:52,981
but then also still the continued goal of like no contracting,

408
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:56,565
no commissions. I guess how,

409
00:23:56,705 --> 00:24:00,349
what's been your experience in kind of trying to balance those two goals for

410
00:24:00,489 --> 00:24:01,210
like satisfaction?

411
00:24:02,131 --> 00:24:05,052
Well, actually, I think that goal has changed.

412
00:24:05,672 --> 00:24:09,372
Because as we've been doing more and more contract work,

413
00:24:09,753 --> 00:24:12,573
we've been getting more and more interesting jobs.

414
00:24:13,033 --> 00:24:18,454
So right now we're working with other game studios on really cool projects.

415
00:24:18,514 --> 00:24:24,515
We're working with orchestras to create visuals for their concerts.

416
00:24:24,655 --> 00:24:26,856
So we get to do more interesting stuff.

417
00:24:27,516 --> 00:24:34,762
So I think that goal has changed to just like, it's not no more contracts, but it's just like,

418
00:24:34,802 --> 00:24:40,907
let's find the coolest, most interesting contracts we can get, and let's do awesome projects with awesome people.

419
00:24:40,927 --> 00:24:41,608
Yeah.

420
00:24:41,768 --> 00:24:41,988
Thank you.

421
00:24:47,483 --> 00:24:49,965
Congrats on pushing over and keep at it.

422
00:24:50,205 --> 00:24:50,686
Thank you.

423
00:24:51,246 --> 00:24:53,628
Because I know it's very hard.

424
00:24:54,909 --> 00:25:01,374
How do you approach publishers to be able to like fund or pitch your game?

425
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:07,618
So how we approach publishers to get our games published.

426
00:25:09,443 --> 00:25:11,084
Reach out however you can.

427
00:25:11,144 --> 00:25:12,025
Send them emails.

428
00:25:13,606 --> 00:25:17,829
Talk to them on events like this.

429
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:21,212
We just try to put ourselves out there.

430
00:25:21,392 --> 00:25:23,914
And don't be shy.

431
00:25:23,934 --> 00:25:25,535
Not be afraid of getting a no.

432
00:25:25,595 --> 00:25:27,096
Because I think that's something that

433
00:25:28,835 --> 00:25:34,479
A lot of people, they're afraid that they're going to get a negative answer, and then they

434
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:34,980
don't try.

435
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,463
And that's kind of the biggest thing that you need to overcome, I think.

436
00:25:39,063 --> 00:25:39,443
Thank you.

437
00:25:41,865 --> 00:25:42,046
Hi.

438
00:25:42,146 --> 00:25:46,109
What was your paid advertising strategy for Pode at launch?

439
00:25:46,349 --> 00:25:51,894
And now that you've recouped and made some profit, have you been reinvesting in that

440
00:25:51,934 --> 00:25:53,335
sort of user acquisition?

441
00:25:53,775 --> 00:25:55,476
And how has that strategy changed?

442
00:25:55,962 --> 00:26:01,644
Oh, a lot of questions. So what was our budget and strategy for marketing?

443
00:26:02,545 --> 00:26:08,767
We got an investor in, that was like six months before we launched,

444
00:26:08,947 --> 00:26:11,668
and they put in a marketing budget.

445
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:17,530
So we were able to hire a PR studio to do the marketing for us,

446
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:20,031
help us with press outreach and...

447
00:26:21,508 --> 00:26:25,949
do create press releases and stuff like that.

448
00:26:26,029 --> 00:26:29,470
We got kind of the help that we needed on that front,

449
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:35,872
which was very helpful because we definitely wouldn't have been able to reach out to the press the way that we did

450
00:26:35,892 --> 00:26:38,492
if we hadn't used Astute for that.

451
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:41,193
And are you still marketing the game today?

452
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:42,673
Sorry?

453
00:26:42,693 --> 00:26:44,794
Are you still marketing the game today?

454
00:26:45,572 --> 00:26:57,598
Yeah, so we do, like I said, we do a lot of not necessarily high-budget stuff, but we do discounts, we do events, we launch on platforms when we can.

455
00:26:57,638 --> 00:27:02,721
We kind of try to always be relevant and be present on social media and stuff like that.

456
00:27:03,481 --> 00:27:09,824
From time to time we do paid advertisements, but usually very low budget stuff.

457
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:17,128
But it seems to be enough to kind of just keep things rolling and just like get to the critical mass where stuff starts happening by itself.

458
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:18,229
Thank you.

459
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,831
Congratulations. It was really cool to hear.

460
00:27:26,253 --> 00:27:30,095
You mentioned how when you started there was basically no game industry in Norway.

461
00:27:31,176 --> 00:27:34,117
And that was my experience as well when I moved away like 10 years ago.

462
00:27:34,257 --> 00:27:37,137
There was basically nothing.

463
00:27:38,238 --> 00:27:42,378
But there's always been a lot more in, for example, Denmark and Sweden, I think.

464
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:46,479
So, two questions. One, like, why do you think that is?

465
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,580
Where does that difference come from? And is it different today?

466
00:27:51,981 --> 00:27:54,521
Oh, well, it's definitely... So the question is,

467
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:59,262
why is the Swedish and Danish industry so much bigger?

468
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,631
And if it's still like that today.

469
00:28:01,651 --> 00:28:05,995
It's definitely still like that today.

470
00:28:06,015 --> 00:28:07,856
The Norwegian industry is very small.

471
00:28:08,056 --> 00:28:12,840
And I don't know if I have a good answer for why it's like that.

472
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:19,846
But there has definitely been a lot of work from the Swedish and Danish.

473
00:28:20,386 --> 00:28:26,128
Governments to kind of push those industries forward and there is a lot of interesting stuff happening in Norway as well

474
00:28:26,188 --> 00:28:27,968
We have we have gotten a lot more

475
00:28:29,949 --> 00:28:36,171
Attention from the government in the later years and there's definitely we're seeing kind of the fruits of that now

476
00:28:36,271 --> 00:28:40,712
There is there is growth definitely and there is a lot more interesting stuff coming out in Norway as well

477
00:28:40,772 --> 00:28:43,573
So hopefully it's gonna kind of level out a bit a little bit

478
00:28:43,653 --> 00:28:47,814
But yeah, I think it's gonna be difficult to come to the level of especially the Swedish industry

479
00:28:49,615 --> 00:28:50,035
Cool. Thank you

480
00:28:53,657 --> 00:28:54,898
Hi, congratulations, by the way.

481
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:59,042
Um, I'm, I have a question actually very much along the same lines.

482
00:28:59,162 --> 00:29:03,966
I'm also from a part of Canada that is not where the bulk of the industry is.

483
00:29:03,986 --> 00:29:07,649
Um, most people would tell me just move to Montreal if you want to continue to

484
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:09,191
try to do business and games in Canada.

485
00:29:10,031 --> 00:29:14,195
Um, and I really want to try and grow games in my little, you know, similar

486
00:29:14,255 --> 00:29:16,697
to Bergen, but in Canada, you know, it's not where the hub is.

487
00:29:17,231 --> 00:29:23,541
I wondered if you've had any challenges or had people suggest the same to you, that you

488
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:27,627
shouldn't try to make it work in Bergen, or have you done anything locally to try and

489
00:29:27,647 --> 00:29:28,689
help grow games there as well?

490
00:29:29,253 --> 00:29:37,779
Yeah, there definitely was in the beginning kind of people who were like, well, why don't you just like help build the industry in Oslo because it's already bigger?

491
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,623
There's, you know, closer to the government, all that stuff.

492
00:29:42,883 --> 00:29:45,966
But I think so people from Bergen are pretty stubborn.

493
00:29:46,046 --> 00:29:49,308
So when somebody tells them to not do something, we definitely do it.

494
00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:51,069
But we did we did.

495
00:29:53,697 --> 00:30:02,166
So first of all, we started very early to just have gatherings with everyone in Bergen who wanted to work in the games industry.

496
00:30:02,346 --> 00:30:03,427
And we've built like...

497
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:05,790
We started the...

498
00:30:07,827 --> 00:30:15,112
Norwegian Game Developers Guild from Bergen. We have started a conference in Bergen, so we have

499
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:21,075
kind of this history of creating a community, like actively creating a community to make it happen,

500
00:30:21,215 --> 00:30:28,499
and that has definitely helped kind of bring more interest to Bergen and more people want to come to

501
00:30:28,539 --> 00:30:33,582
Bergen because we kind of have that community. So I think the best place to start is just like

502
00:30:33,602 --> 00:30:36,904
gather people, create a community, and just...

503
00:30:37,587 --> 00:30:39,409
Do cool stuff together, basically.

504
00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:40,449
Cool, thank you.

505
00:30:40,509 --> 00:30:40,630
Yeah.

506
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:41,590
Ok.

507
00:30:42,711 --> 00:30:43,792
Hi, I'm Joshua.

508
00:30:43,812 --> 00:30:45,113
I'm from EastAsiaSoft.

509
00:30:45,153 --> 00:30:46,174
We are a publisher.

510
00:30:46,514 --> 00:30:49,796
We publish about 150 games a year between PC and consoles.

511
00:30:50,697 --> 00:30:54,660
And one of the most rewarding things about my job is reaching out to indies who might

512
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,404
not be able to reach certain platforms on their own, or certain regions on their own.

513
00:31:00,805 --> 00:31:01,685
But you didn't do that.

514
00:31:01,786 --> 00:31:04,808
You apparently ended up doing all of it yourself.

515
00:31:05,538 --> 00:31:08,880
So I know you had to come up against some challenges with that.

516
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:09,520
What was...

517
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:14,002
How did you approach it, getting access to the platforms and the dev kits

518
00:31:14,062 --> 00:31:16,183
and everything that you needed to come to consoles?

519
00:31:17,284 --> 00:31:19,865
Um, the hard way.

520
00:31:19,905 --> 00:31:20,405
It is hard.

521
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:31,770
I mean, I've like chased down people from Sony and it's just like being a pest, basically.

522
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:34,171
That's, I think that's my best answer.

523
00:31:34,895 --> 00:31:36,876
I'm being determined to take it away.

524
00:31:37,316 --> 00:31:37,617
All right.

525
00:31:37,637 --> 00:31:38,317
Thank you.

526
00:31:38,778 --> 00:31:39,198
Thank you.

527
00:31:39,318 --> 00:31:39,598
OK.

528
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:40,939
I think we need to get out.

529
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:42,360
I think we're out of time.

530
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,442
But I'll move on to the archives.

531
00:31:45,582 --> 00:31:46,923
I think it's just around the corner here.

532
00:31:47,004 --> 00:31:49,085
And if anyone wants to chat further,

533
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:49,886
we can do it right there.

534
00:31:50,566 --> 00:31:50,926
Thank you.

535
00:31:50,946 --> 00:31:58,152
Thank you.
