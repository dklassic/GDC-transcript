1
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,301
All right, well, welcome.

2
00:00:06,341 --> 00:00:12,903
This is a talk by me, Marty O'Donnell, and my lovely assistant.

3
00:00:12,983 --> 00:00:14,043
Actually, she's not my assistant.

4
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:18,865
She is a fabulous user research person from Bungie.

5
00:00:20,025 --> 00:00:25,847
And so we're talking about the emotional puppeteer uncovering the musical strings that tie our

6
00:00:25,907 --> 00:00:26,768
hearts to games.

7
00:00:27,802 --> 00:00:32,626
And this came about, even just having this kind of talk came

8
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:37,371
about because of a talk that I gave last year that had some

9
00:00:37,391 --> 00:00:40,493
musical examples that I will probably share again today.

10
00:00:41,354 --> 00:00:45,317
And Brandy saw the talk, and she came to me as a user

11
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:48,740
researcher, and she said, hey, wouldn't it be interesting to

12
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,723
know what people's emotional responses are to some of these

13
00:00:51,763 --> 00:00:52,443
pieces of music?

14
00:00:52,483 --> 00:00:54,645
And I'm like, maybe.

15
00:00:54,665 --> 00:00:55,166
I mean.

16
00:00:56,295 --> 00:01:00,158
I already know what it is because I have an intuition about this stuff, and that's why

17
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:05,622
I get hired and get paid, and I don't want some user research thing somehow stomping

18
00:01:05,782 --> 00:01:06,863
on my intuition.

19
00:01:07,603 --> 00:01:12,387
But we talked about it for a long time, and Brandy had some absolutely spectacularly cool

20
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,848
ideas which we're going to share with you today.

21
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:16,470
And one of the other things I'm going to say about Brandy...

22
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,974
Which also intrigued me is that she's this absolutely brilliant user research person

23
00:01:21,994 --> 00:01:28,139
that understands numbers and statistics and how to test people.

24
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,184
And no matter what Bill Fulton says, Brandy is able to just determine.

25
00:01:34,204 --> 00:01:36,906
I'm embarrassing her now because she understands statistics.

26
00:01:37,146 --> 00:01:41,710
And even if she doesn't, I can like twist them to meet what I want for my own needs.

27
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,351
So that's good.

28
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:46,160
But she's also a music major.

29
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,021
She has a degree in music.

30
00:01:48,762 --> 00:01:50,643
And what school did you go to again?

31
00:01:51,203 --> 00:01:54,365
Trinity University, San Antonio, and then the UW.

32
00:01:54,926 --> 00:01:55,506
Oh, excellent.

33
00:01:55,626 --> 00:01:55,926
OK.

34
00:01:56,927 --> 00:01:58,408
And she's one of those very special people.

35
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:02,691
Like when I was at the conservatory, we had music

36
00:02:02,711 --> 00:02:04,372
majors, and they were in two groups.

37
00:02:04,392 --> 00:02:06,333
There were the musicians and the singers.

38
00:02:07,554 --> 00:02:09,855
And oh, that's me.

39
00:02:12,146 --> 00:02:13,627
But she is a musician and a singer.

40
00:02:13,647 --> 00:02:15,688
So it is possible to combine the two.

41
00:02:16,508 --> 00:02:17,268
Bridge the gap.

42
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:20,490
All right, so here we go.

43
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,211
We're going to talk about the most important thing.

44
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,432
How many people here are composers or audio people?

45
00:02:25,552 --> 00:02:26,312
Oh, lots.

46
00:02:26,372 --> 00:02:27,013
All right, that's great.

47
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:28,313
Now, how many people are just?

48
00:02:29,247 --> 00:02:31,808
Producers, game designers, stuff like that.

49
00:02:31,848 --> 00:02:32,768
OK, so there's a few.

50
00:02:33,149 --> 00:02:34,669
Well, all right, you guys are outnumbered.

51
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:37,391
Because we're trying to convince everybody who is not

52
00:02:37,431 --> 00:02:43,154
a musician or an audio person the importance of audio and

53
00:02:43,254 --> 00:02:47,196
music especially in terms of being able to tell an

54
00:02:47,256 --> 00:02:50,298
emotional story and enhance the emotional journey that we

55
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:51,418
want our players to go on.

56
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:57,141
And so this is some tools that we're going to show you today that I think actually confirm

57
00:02:57,181 --> 00:03:00,802
a lot of what we already believe, especially those of us who believe strongly that music

58
00:03:00,862 --> 00:03:01,402
is powerful.

59
00:03:02,123 --> 00:03:08,325
But it's also, I think, some confirmation of that in a way that the producers and the

60
00:03:08,385 --> 00:03:13,768
designers and the engineers especially can see some hard numbers.

61
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,163
So, here we go. When you start thinking about coming up with some great ideas for games,

62
00:03:19,183 --> 00:03:21,966
you have this, like, giant pile of, like, crazy ideas.

63
00:03:23,027 --> 00:03:28,031
And usually you get, you need to put it all together, so there's this magic game development

64
00:03:28,071 --> 00:03:32,494
box that all these ideas get into. And at the end, I think the most important

65
00:03:32,514 --> 00:03:39,520
thing that we want is to have an experience for the player that is this absolutely delicious

66
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,041
experience.

67
00:03:40,617 --> 00:03:44,599
Whatever that is, it's a chocolate fudge something cool.

68
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:51,421
And what causes players to have this experience that not only

69
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:54,742
they want to have again, but just makes them feel really

70
00:03:54,762 --> 00:03:55,763
good about themselves?

71
00:03:56,683 --> 00:04:01,905
And I believe that the emotions is the most important thing that sticks with people.

72
00:04:01,985 --> 00:04:05,146
So here's just a little word picture of...

73
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:08,008
I think they're called word clouds, you told me.

74
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,148
They are called word clouds.

75
00:04:09,168 --> 00:04:09,968
Okay, word clouds.

76
00:04:10,188 --> 00:04:14,450
Of the kinds of things that if we can get the player to feel these emotions...

77
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:20,032
While they're playing the game and when they think about how they felt after they get done

78
00:04:20,072 --> 00:04:23,615
playing a game, if we can do that, that's an amazingly powerful thing.

79
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:33,262
And I maintain that music is the single most powerful tool to enhance the emotional journey

80
00:04:33,442 --> 00:04:34,163
of our players.

81
00:04:34,723 --> 00:04:40,647
There's many, many things, many ingredients that go into making our players feel strong

82
00:04:40,688 --> 00:04:41,148
emotions.

83
00:04:41,588 --> 00:04:44,791
But I think as a singular element, music is the most powerful.

84
00:04:45,531 --> 00:04:47,112
And hopefully we'll sort of prove that today.

85
00:04:48,172 --> 00:04:51,653
And of course, you know, music has got a lot of different flavors going on.

86
00:04:52,254 --> 00:04:52,434
So...

87
00:04:57,736 --> 00:05:01,337
You know, the funny thing about this picture is it was originally from something else, obviously.

88
00:05:02,658 --> 00:05:06,339
And we have a little... Brandy has no idea what I'm going to say.

89
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:07,520
This is what's fun about this, too.

90
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,041
She's very organized. She put this whole deck together.

91
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:13,522
And then she gives it to me, and I'm like, I'm just going to improvise.

92
00:05:13,582 --> 00:05:14,863
So, it's too bad.

93
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:20,364
But the original picture was just some guy from a TV show, right?

94
00:05:20,384 --> 00:05:21,645
Yeah, it was. What was that show?

95
00:05:23,066 --> 00:05:23,846
Reaper. Right.

96
00:05:23,946 --> 00:05:28,249
Okay. And I happened to mention that it would be funny if my head was on it.

97
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:34,874
And we have an internal email alias called Bungie Spam.

98
00:05:35,194 --> 00:05:39,197
And Brandi is new enough to not know the dangers of Bungie Spam.

99
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,778
I didn't know how horrible it would be.

100
00:05:42,619 --> 00:05:44,900
So when I said it would be fun to get one of the guys,

101
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,900
one of the artists, to just stick my head on this picture,

102
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,821
she went to spam, put the picture out, and she just said,

103
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:53,202
could somebody put Marty's head in this picture?

104
00:05:56,643 --> 00:05:59,123
And as John said, I should have been a little more specific.

105
00:06:01,144 --> 00:06:02,144
So this is the best one.

106
00:06:04,205 --> 00:06:05,085
Certainly the safest.

107
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:13,589
There were several that came back that would be absolutely inappropriate here, but we had

108
00:06:13,609 --> 00:06:14,450
a good laugh about it.

109
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:22,894
Okay, so yes, to a certain extent, the composers are the puppeteers of the emotions of people.

110
00:06:22,994 --> 00:06:24,394
I mean, that's what I maintain.

111
00:06:25,035 --> 00:06:25,775
That's what I like to do.

112
00:06:25,835 --> 00:06:28,796
That's what I try to sell people, is what I do.

113
00:06:30,538 --> 00:06:36,103
The problem, of course, is that you can be manipulative, you can do cliché stuff, and

114
00:06:36,123 --> 00:06:40,067
we all have our ideas about how to get out of cliché and how not to manipulate and how

115
00:06:40,107 --> 00:06:44,791
to try to do something that actually enhances the emotions without causing, calling too

116
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:45,812
much attention to itself.

117
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:51,437
And so one of the things that I think is interesting about this

118
00:06:52,432 --> 00:06:55,935
This process that I'm going through with Brandy is that when she first came to me about this,

119
00:06:55,975 --> 00:06:56,835
I was a little bit worried.

120
00:06:57,596 --> 00:07:01,879
And some of you know that I have this theory about the goose.

121
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,741
Anybody remember the theory about the goose?

122
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:08,063
So my theory is that it's important to be nice to the goose.

123
00:07:08,163 --> 00:07:13,928
And the goose is the creature, the living, breathing creature that lays golden eggs.

124
00:07:14,848 --> 00:07:18,271
And the interesting thing about the goose, and people get this wrong.

125
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:22,482
But, it's not a golden goose. It's just a regular old goose.

126
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:27,105
But, it happens to lay golden eggs. So, pay attention to the eggs that the goose lays.

127
00:07:28,026 --> 00:07:31,148
Don't be nice to the eggs, because that's not going to get you any more eggs.

128
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:33,670
Be nice to the goose, because that's what you want.

129
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:38,614
The goose can be an individual person. Brandy. I have to be nice to Brandy,

130
00:07:38,634 --> 00:07:43,518
because if I stomp on her ideas, then she decides not to share anything with me.

131
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:47,201
People stomp on my music ideas. I'm like, okay, no music for you.

132
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:48,122
But, I mean...

133
00:07:49,242 --> 00:07:53,765
And I think in game development, the real important thing is that as a team, teams are

134
00:07:53,785 --> 00:07:55,507
the goose that lays the golden egg.

135
00:07:55,607 --> 00:08:00,750
So the more we can be nice to the teams and the more we can work together, the better

136
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,131
our eggs will end up being.

137
00:08:02,831 --> 00:08:06,874
And so I'm a little bit worried about and suspicious about user research stuff because

138
00:08:06,894 --> 00:08:07,294
numbers are involved.

139
00:08:07,314 --> 00:08:09,195
Numbers are a little bit scary to me because it proves that I might be wrong about something

140
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:09,976
and I don't want that.

141
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:10,416
I get that a lot.

142
00:08:10,436 --> 00:08:11,977
And that's just how I feel about it.

143
00:08:11,997 --> 00:08:12,177
I'm sorry.

144
00:08:12,197 --> 00:08:12,678
I'm gonna take a break.

145
00:08:12,698 --> 00:08:12,998
That's okay.

146
00:08:13,018 --> 00:08:13,598
There's always a next time.

147
00:08:13,638 --> 00:08:14,239
And we'll talk much later.

148
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:14,919
I'm gonna take a look outside.

149
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:14,999
Bye.

150
00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:15,119
Bye.

151
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:15,219
Bye.

152
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:15,359
Bye.

153
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:15,439
Bye.

154
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:15,519
Bye.

155
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:15,599
Bye.

156
00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:15,679
Bye.

157
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:15,780
Bye.

158
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:15,860
Bye.

159
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:15,960
Bye.

160
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,040
Bye.

161
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,120
Bye.

162
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:16,200
Bye.

163
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:16,280
Bye.

164
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:16,360
Bye.

165
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:16,440
Bye.

166
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:16,580
Bye.

167
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:16,660
Bye.

168
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:16,860
Bye.

169
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:16,960
Bye.

170
00:08:17,304 --> 00:08:24,892
The important thing is to protect the golden goose because you don't want some process

171
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:26,814
to kill the goose.

172
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:29,357
So that's why that.

173
00:08:29,557 --> 00:08:32,901
You know, every time I show this picture, I showed it last year too, the whole room

174
00:08:32,941 --> 00:08:34,683
just goes shooom.

175
00:08:35,644 --> 00:08:38,847
But this should imprint in your head, don't kill the goose.

176
00:08:41,405 --> 00:08:46,486
People are complicated, our audience is complicated, the people in our studios that work with us

177
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,327
are complicated, extremely complicated.

178
00:08:48,627 --> 00:08:50,488
Maybe not so complicated.

179
00:08:51,148 --> 00:08:51,988
They're dysfunctional.

180
00:08:52,248 --> 00:08:58,350
But trying to figure out some common way of talking about emotions, especially for

181
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,731
gamers, is not easy.

182
00:09:01,371 --> 00:09:05,713
And that was our first, I think, the first thing we wanted to accomplish.

183
00:09:06,073 --> 00:09:06,953
But the other thing is that...

184
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:14,266
We want to give the composers some insight into people's emotions, no matter how complex

185
00:09:14,286 --> 00:09:14,527
they are.

186
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:22,513
Is there some way to distill some language that could apply to specific pieces of music

187
00:09:22,573 --> 00:09:24,294
and actually have it be accurate?

188
00:09:25,275 --> 00:09:30,719
And the reason we want this is we want to be able to have some real tools so we can

189
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:35,743
go to battle with the suits.

190
00:09:37,674 --> 00:09:45,420
The people who might be questioning what you're trying to do, it's like if you can say, well look, I know this is going to work because my gut tells me it's going to work.

191
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:51,885
But also look, here's a pile of numbers and here's this nice research stuff that helps confirm it.

192
00:09:53,006 --> 00:09:55,408
But of course, I think that it's important to...

193
00:09:58,611 --> 00:09:59,731
See, now what is this picture?

194
00:10:02,178 --> 00:10:05,600
So apparently that, and Brandy picked this picture out, which is pretty amazing, but

195
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,184
that's, she's the hyena there, and apparently I'm the old guy with the muzzle on her.

196
00:10:10,304 --> 00:10:16,669
But if the tools start to get in the way of the creative process, she is absolutely willing

197
00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:17,169
to be muzzled.

198
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:18,190
Is that what you meant by this?

199
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:18,830
Not quite.

200
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:19,050
Laughter.

201
00:10:19,071 --> 00:10:19,391
Laughter.

202
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:19,611
Laughter.

203
00:10:19,631 --> 00:10:19,791
Laughter.

204
00:10:19,811 --> 00:10:19,971
Laughter.

205
00:10:19,991 --> 00:10:20,191
Laughter.

206
00:10:20,211 --> 00:10:20,371
Laughter.

207
00:10:20,392 --> 00:10:20,552
Laughter.

208
00:10:20,572 --> 00:10:20,732
Laughter.

209
00:10:20,752 --> 00:10:20,912
Laughter.

210
00:10:20,932 --> 00:10:21,092
Laughter.

211
00:10:21,112 --> 00:10:21,312
Laughter.

212
00:10:22,634 --> 00:10:25,575
It's the, yeah, I don't know, I'm not going to read the notes, but that's the way I look at it.

213
00:10:25,615 --> 00:10:26,056
So there you go.

214
00:10:26,076 --> 00:10:30,278
It's okay. I think I meant that you could muzzle the people who are giving you feedback.

215
00:10:30,298 --> 00:10:35,942
So the users can decide what they're allowed to tell you so that they can't trample you.

216
00:10:35,962 --> 00:10:38,484
But if I need a muzzle, that's okay.

217
00:10:38,584 --> 00:10:43,006
I mean you in the user research sense of view, not you personally.

218
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:44,267
Fair enough. Fair enough.

219
00:10:45,088 --> 00:10:49,010
Okay, so let's get started with Brandy. I think you have some stuff to show.

220
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:49,871
Oh, sure.

221
00:10:50,011 --> 00:10:50,471
All right.

222
00:10:50,571 --> 00:10:51,132
Sounds great.

223
00:10:53,808 --> 00:10:56,290
So, let's talk about feelings.

224
00:10:56,991 --> 00:10:57,191
Yeah.

225
00:10:58,252 --> 00:10:58,732
I, I love

226
00:10:58,752 --> 00:10:58,892
them.

227
00:10:58,972 --> 00:10:59,813
Who wants to share?

228
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,495
Sharing time.

229
00:11:03,676 --> 00:11:04,016
Right.

230
00:11:04,356 --> 00:11:07,739
So, the, the first thing we noticed in diving

231
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:10,061
into this is, of course, that getting people to

232
00:11:10,101 --> 00:11:12,663
share anything about their feelings, or even for them

233
00:11:12,723 --> 00:11:16,345
to recognize that they even have specific feelings, is

234
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,046
challenging.

235
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,428
And what makes it worse is that our, our

236
00:11:20,488 --> 00:11:22,510
group of users are.

237
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:27,174
Particularly lacking in some maybe emotional recognition there.

238
00:11:31,137 --> 00:11:37,201
And also what we discovered is that music is something that while it has such powerful control

239
00:11:37,301 --> 00:11:42,085
over our emotions, it's also very amorphous. And if it's something we haven't heard before,

240
00:11:42,145 --> 00:11:47,349
we don't have associations to, it's really hard to really pick out or, you know,

241
00:11:47,369 --> 00:11:49,010
kind of get into something solidified.

242
00:11:49,931 --> 00:11:55,717
Whenever you're just listening to this big amorphous thing, even if you close your eyes, it's still hard to really figure it out.

243
00:11:55,817 --> 00:12:00,001
And just so, I'm going to interrupt. Brandy knows I'm going to interrupt. She never knows when it's going to happen.

244
00:12:00,501 --> 00:12:08,649
But this row of emotional people here are some bungee guys that at this moment are actually testing the game.

245
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:15,195
And it doesn't look like there's a whole lot of emotion going on. I think it's a great picture. Anyway, keep going.

246
00:12:16,888 --> 00:12:20,731
So yeah, so as a quick exercise, I'm going to play a little one minute piece of music,

247
00:12:20,811 --> 00:12:23,193
one of the ones we actually used in the studies that we did.

248
00:12:23,974 --> 00:12:27,457
And just try to start thinking about how it makes you feel and try to see how well you

249
00:12:27,477 --> 00:12:29,739
can kind of latch on to what some of those feelings are.

250
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:33,402
And close your eyes, because looking at that picture will not help you identify the feelings.

251
00:12:33,422 --> 00:12:34,403
Their mugs are no good.

252
00:12:34,423 --> 00:12:34,804
It's true.

253
00:12:50,274 --> 00:12:50,334
You

254
00:13:27,331 --> 00:13:32,680
Hmm, so yeah, maybe a little mysterious, maybe a little eerie.

255
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:34,955
It's kind of hard to tell, though.

256
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:36,356
It sort of goes everywhere.

257
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,318
It's not just one particular sound.

258
00:13:38,378 --> 00:13:39,879
It's this big whole idea.

259
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:41,660
And what are we going to do with that?

260
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:47,724
So when I set out to try studying this stuff, we knew we were coming up with a whole bunch

261
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,806
of challenges here, but we wanted to take a stab at it anyways.

262
00:13:50,926 --> 00:13:56,409
So I came to Marty and asked him if he could give me, oh, 10 or 15 music clips that he

263
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:59,992
thought represented a big, diverse set of emotions, because I really wanted to try to

264
00:14:00,052 --> 00:14:01,793
nail all sorts of things in the spectrum.

265
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,751
And see how much we could learn about it.

266
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:07,293
And Marty, he's so wonderful.

267
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,715
He gave me a whole stack of 50 clips

268
00:14:09,775 --> 00:14:12,356
that were between 30 seconds and a minute long.

269
00:14:13,517 --> 00:14:15,278
So to narrow them down, I went home,

270
00:14:15,358 --> 00:14:17,760
got a big glass of wine, sat on the couch,

271
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,802
and artfully poured through for hours

272
00:14:20,862 --> 00:14:22,883
just sitting there trying to feel and try to think,

273
00:14:23,323 --> 00:14:25,485
is this one different emotionally than this one?

274
00:14:26,005 --> 00:14:26,965
Actually, I might have meant that.

275
00:14:27,206 --> 00:14:29,367
I think alcohol might be the single most powerful

276
00:14:29,387 --> 00:14:29,967
chemistry.

277
00:14:31,567 --> 00:14:35,008
We can't deliver that with every game, but anyway, there you go.

278
00:14:36,728 --> 00:14:41,209
Oh, man, at the end of those few hours of just going through the pieces over and over and over again,

279
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:45,070
I was total wreck, emotionally, just going on this fun roller coaster,

280
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:49,771
and I don't know if it was the wine or the music, but either way, it was slightly traumatic.

281
00:14:51,551 --> 00:14:53,392
But in the end, we came to this set,

282
00:14:53,632 --> 00:14:57,953
and I want to explicitly call out the people who we've used it in their, uh...

283
00:14:59,572 --> 00:15:10,341
The interesting thing about this particular set was like Brandy said, there were probably about 50 pieces that I had actually used for Jason Jones a couple years ago.

284
00:15:10,921 --> 00:15:15,946
One of our lead designers at Bungie, he's actually the founder of Bungie, and we were talking about music and emotions.

285
00:15:16,866 --> 00:15:19,649
I actually wanted to see if he agreed with me.

286
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:25,391
about like when I listen to this piece, this is the kind of feelings I get, this is the kind of story I have in my head,

287
00:15:25,451 --> 00:15:27,512
and I wanted to see how he responded to it.

288
00:15:27,532 --> 00:15:29,352
So I had already had a lot of music.

289
00:15:29,913 --> 00:15:33,354
And of course he ended up getting tired after about, I don't know, 15 minutes.

290
00:15:33,414 --> 00:15:35,815
It was just too much emotions, too much music.

291
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:40,836
But I was pretty well confirmed, and I thought it was a good set of music to try to run by somebody.

292
00:15:41,717 --> 00:15:46,999
So I threw it at Brandy and then she came up with this set, which is interesting.

293
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:51,120
It's, as you can tell, and some of you here, I'm sure, will even recognize some of these pieces.

294
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:56,383
It's almost none of it is from Halo, except for the last bit, which we'll get to.

295
00:15:56,943 --> 00:16:01,645
But most of it is film scores that I've really enjoyed, that I like, and...

296
00:16:03,652 --> 00:16:04,653
composers for films?

297
00:16:05,013 --> 00:16:08,057
And that ended up being the stuff that, even though we had

298
00:16:08,657 --> 00:16:11,841
a lot of classical music, and some fusion, and some other stuff,

299
00:16:12,622 --> 00:16:14,984
Brandy came up with this, which I think was very evocative,

300
00:16:15,024 --> 00:16:16,826
and a lot of fun to see how it works.

301
00:16:18,076 --> 00:16:22,817
Yeah, and as we heard about this morning, you know, so much of film and game music really

302
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:23,737
tells a story.

303
00:16:23,937 --> 00:16:29,538
And the interesting thing that I noticed as I was going through all these 50 pieces

304
00:16:29,598 --> 00:16:33,579
trying to find a good diverse set was that one of the things that helped me the most

305
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:38,220
was to have kind of an intermediate step where I tried to imagine a story that was happening

306
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:44,181
or try to picture a scene or something that made it a little bit more real for me as to

307
00:16:44,241 --> 00:16:47,301
what it was that I was experiencing when I was listening.

308
00:16:48,062 --> 00:16:49,383
So when we were studying this, that

309
00:16:49,403 --> 00:16:51,584
was actually the very first question we gave people.

310
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,547
When they came to a page, they saw just this text,

311
00:16:54,927 --> 00:16:57,129
and they were asked to listen to a piece of music

312
00:16:57,189 --> 00:17:01,092
and be thinking of what they saw happening here.

313
00:17:01,432 --> 00:17:04,114
Like, what would be going on if this is what you were hearing?

314
00:17:04,575 --> 00:17:05,916
And I'm going to have you guys try that now.

315
00:17:21,533 --> 00:17:23,014
This transcript was provided by Transcription Outsourcing, LLC.

316
00:17:58,229 --> 00:18:02,970
What was fascinating was that whenever we ran this with a total of 70 people, all 70

317
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:08,151
were able to come up with really interesting stories for every single piece of music we

318
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:08,911
put in front of them.

319
00:18:09,771 --> 00:18:14,932
This one is particularly eloquent for our group, but still representative of a lot of

320
00:18:14,952 --> 00:18:18,533
the detail that people could conjure just imagining whenever they're listening to a

321
00:18:18,573 --> 00:18:19,313
piece of music.

322
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:24,674
And some of them had common themes, you know, sort of post-war type themes came up a lot

323
00:18:24,694 --> 00:18:25,675
for this type of music.

324
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:31,273
But each one was unique, each one meant something a little bit different to each person, but

325
00:18:31,313 --> 00:18:32,894
it was very fascinating.

326
00:18:32,914 --> 00:18:35,295
Yeah, and this actually shocked me.

327
00:18:35,395 --> 00:18:40,537
Number one, it was, I didn't know the guys at Bungie were this eloquent, number one.

328
00:18:42,198 --> 00:18:45,359
But if I had been asked to say something about a piece of music, I would have said, well,

329
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:48,360
starts poignant, kind of ends hopeful, and next.

330
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:53,022
I mean, I'm not very eloquent in terms of the stories, I'm thinking in a completely

331
00:18:53,042 --> 00:18:53,742
different kind of way.

332
00:18:54,403 --> 00:18:55,843
To realize that.

333
00:18:56,815 --> 00:19:05,378
This is how powerful music is to, well I was going to say normal people, to people in general.

334
00:19:05,438 --> 00:19:10,920
I think music is so powerful that they actually have really strong stories that can be evoked

335
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,880
by the music itself.

336
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,701
And that's a really interesting thing to know.

337
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:18,011
So while we really enjoyed reading all the stories,

338
00:19:18,451 --> 00:19:20,572
there was more that we wanted to learn from this too.

339
00:19:20,612 --> 00:19:22,793
We really would like to nail down a little bit better

340
00:19:22,873 --> 00:19:25,634
exactly what does that mean then for the emotional story.

341
00:19:26,254 --> 00:19:29,335
What is the picture that we can get from people's emotions?

342
00:19:29,575 --> 00:19:32,676
And after we got people sort of into this imaginative

343
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:35,697
kind of creative mindset, for some reason they didn't seem

344
00:19:35,737 --> 00:19:38,798
to balk as badly when we asked them to then talk

345
00:19:38,818 --> 00:19:40,479
a little bit more about emotions or tell us

346
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:42,379
what feelings were associated with that.

347
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:47,582
I ran this on a number of Bungie employees as pilots inside the studio.

348
00:19:47,642 --> 00:19:51,724
And I was sitting in a conference room, this little bitty space, just playing music and

349
00:19:51,764 --> 00:19:53,024
asking them to tell me stories.

350
00:19:53,104 --> 00:19:57,867
And even one guy that walked in looked around and said, oh my god, it looks like a shrink's

351
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:58,607
office in here.

352
00:19:59,127 --> 00:20:00,188
And that's the censored version.

353
00:20:03,854 --> 00:20:08,278
He didn't even balk once he got a little bit further into it and got a little bit more

354
00:20:08,338 --> 00:20:08,798
comfortable.

355
00:20:08,898 --> 00:20:13,962
So it was kind of surprising that we were even able to get somebody with that much discomfort

356
00:20:14,042 --> 00:20:15,423
to be able to get through this stuff.

357
00:20:16,384 --> 00:20:20,147
So the next type of question that we ask people, and I'm going to play part of that same piece

358
00:20:20,207 --> 00:20:24,530
again and have you guys try to pick out as well up to three words that you think sort

359
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:28,273
of fit the feelings that you sense as you listen to this piece of music.

360
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:38,757
This transcript was provided by Transcription Outsourcing, LLC.

361
00:21:09,362 --> 00:21:14,023
One of the things I forgot to mention that I like about this type of question is that

362
00:21:14,603 --> 00:21:17,884
it gives people a language that they didn't necessarily have before.

363
00:21:18,225 --> 00:21:22,186
So if people aren't used to having to tell us what sorts of feelings they have, this

364
00:21:22,246 --> 00:21:25,347
makes it a little bit simpler to just have a few options to choose from.

365
00:21:25,927 --> 00:21:29,788
And while it may not represent every single possible feeling, because I don't even think

366
00:21:29,828 --> 00:21:33,910
that's remotely possible, at least it gives them a way to start trying to identify some

367
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:36,691
of those mixtures of things that are going on for them.

368
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:46,338
And what we got out of this question from the 70 people we were looking at was something that looks like that word cloud you saw at the beginning of the talk today.

369
00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:53,044
You see that the more people who chose a particular word, the larger it appears here.

370
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:55,786
So each of these words is proportional to the number of people who chose it.

371
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,844
said that feeling was evoked for them in that piece of music.

372
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:02,149
And what's neat about this is that it's not simple.

373
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:05,554
You can't put numbers to music and make it simple

374
00:22:06,015 --> 00:22:09,640
because music is never simple. Each piece is unique. It's going to have its own

375
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,802
mixture of emotions.

376
00:22:11,795 --> 00:22:18,798
And it's great that we see that this piece is not only sad to people, but it's moving, it's reflective, it's serene, and it's also hopeful.

377
00:22:19,318 --> 00:22:22,660
So even though it's all those things, it's this really great mix.

378
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:27,782
And it's great to see that it's not just a simple answer of what do we think this represents.

379
00:22:28,863 --> 00:22:31,524
And what we call it now is the emotional fingerprint.

380
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:36,206
Because if you look at this thing, no two pieces are ever going to be exactly alike.

381
00:22:36,386 --> 00:22:40,448
There will be some that will be similar, but each one will have its own unique emotional profile.

382
00:22:41,881 --> 00:22:47,208
So something else that is important to know is just how consistently or how far do we

383
00:22:47,268 --> 00:22:50,552
feel specific emotions that we're especially interested in.

384
00:22:51,193 --> 00:22:52,775
So in games, something that is...

385
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:58,351
typically really important is balancing calm moments with exciting moments.

386
00:22:58,371 --> 00:23:01,513
Because if it's too exciting all the time, people get bored or overwhelmed.

387
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:04,794
Or if it's too calm, then they just don't feel like they're getting anywhere.

388
00:23:04,814 --> 00:23:09,516
And so being able to know really how much are we getting from people in those two areas

389
00:23:09,576 --> 00:23:13,797
at the times whenever we want them to feel more excited or more calm

390
00:23:13,918 --> 00:23:15,738
is one of the things that we'd like to know more about.

391
00:23:16,419 --> 00:23:19,023
So what we would ask people is to rate their emotional state.

392
00:23:19,063 --> 00:23:24,412
Would they say they were completely calm with this piece, or would they say they were very excited with this piece?

393
00:23:24,432 --> 00:23:26,536
So giving them the option between two opposites.

394
00:23:27,369 --> 00:23:31,112
And for this piece, as expected, it was very consistently calm.

395
00:23:31,132 --> 00:23:33,815
I kind of still want to know who that one guy was.

396
00:23:33,975 --> 00:23:35,537
Yeah, yeah, who's the excited guy?

397
00:23:35,737 --> 00:23:36,177
Excited.

398
00:23:36,197 --> 00:23:39,401
It's okay.

399
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:42,884
Well, we're humans. It always comes out as some sort of...

400
00:23:42,904 --> 00:23:44,866
Well, I'm not going to name names, but there was...

401
00:23:44,886 --> 00:23:49,551
We were talking about this earlier today, but one of our programmers came to me,

402
00:23:49,591 --> 00:23:51,232
and he's a guy I've worked with for years.

403
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,902
Amazingly smart and he goes, oh Marty you gotta hear this music. I got the soundtrack.

404
00:23:56,563 --> 00:23:59,404
It's the most hopeful music I've ever heard. I'm like, oh well that's great.

405
00:23:59,925 --> 00:24:04,508
And I put it on and I'm like, you're kidding me. It was just like, not even going to describe it,

406
00:24:04,548 --> 00:24:08,670
but it was like, for me, it was probably the furthest from hopeful that I could imagine.

407
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:14,214
And I still to this day have no idea what causes him to feel hope by listening to this music.

408
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:17,896
I just felt despair. I mean, it was just amazing. But anyway.

409
00:24:19,267 --> 00:24:20,107
great segway.

410
00:24:21,128 --> 00:24:24,450
One of the other things we asked was where were they on the spectrum between despair

411
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:24,910
and hope.

412
00:24:25,451 --> 00:24:29,814
And for this particular piece of music, it's really fascinating that people really felt

413
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:34,857
very despair, very much despair or very much hope and everything in between.

414
00:24:35,137 --> 00:24:36,758
So it's one of those sorts of pieces that

415
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:39,421
It can mean many things to many different people.

416
00:24:39,601 --> 00:24:42,684
And depending on the moment in your game, that may be awesome.

417
00:24:42,864 --> 00:24:45,407
It may mean that everybody's experience is totally unique,

418
00:24:45,467 --> 00:24:47,609
and it's what they choose to make it.

419
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,132
Or if the story explains something

420
00:24:50,152 --> 00:24:51,874
that is more despair or hope, perhaps

421
00:24:51,914 --> 00:24:53,416
that can sway it more that direction,

422
00:24:53,456 --> 00:24:54,777
depending on where it is in the game.

423
00:24:56,018 --> 00:24:56,939
So that's all pretty neat.

424
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,522
I'm going to hand you back to Marty for interlude.

425
00:25:00,222 --> 00:25:05,504
Yeah, and I love just finding out that, like, there are some chameleon kinds of things that

426
00:25:05,544 --> 00:25:06,184
happen with music.

427
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:10,726
I think all of us who are composers kind of know that already, that we can juxtapose things

428
00:25:10,946 --> 00:25:16,388
and it will take on some meaning based on what it's associated with.

429
00:25:17,068 --> 00:25:21,830
And those pieces that are not necessarily, like, this piece is obviously calm, but it

430
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:24,411
can represent both despair and hope.

431
00:25:24,451 --> 00:25:26,111
And that's a nice thing just to know about it.

432
00:25:27,988 --> 00:25:34,014
So part of this talk was something that I did last year, which I'm calling plan vertical

433
00:25:34,054 --> 00:25:39,879
synchronicity. Everybody remembers that, right? Yeah, okay, great. What that is is a technique

434
00:25:39,899 --> 00:25:46,285
that I use for putting, implementing music in games, and I'm taking advantage of...

435
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:51,111
cognitive bias.

436
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:54,833
And that is, sort of all humans tend to try

437
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:56,113
to make order out of chaos.

438
00:25:56,153 --> 00:25:57,354
I don't know why that is.

439
00:25:57,654 --> 00:25:58,995
Maybe it's an evolutionary thing.

440
00:25:59,615 --> 00:26:02,216
But that's why every culture looks into the night sky

441
00:26:02,476 --> 00:26:03,977
and makes constellations.

442
00:26:04,417 --> 00:26:06,958
So the concept of constellations is really important.

443
00:26:08,219 --> 00:26:10,640
Some of the constellations have a practical meaning,

444
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,561
but there's stories behind

445
00:26:14,482 --> 00:26:18,042
The way human beings look at chaos and try to make some sort of order out of it.

446
00:26:19,003 --> 00:26:20,983
And the way I use that is in...

447
00:26:22,023 --> 00:26:24,824
How many of you know about the technique of having...

448
00:26:27,884 --> 00:26:31,105
Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon playing while you're watching Wizard of Oz?

449
00:26:32,705 --> 00:26:34,786
Okay, that's all the stoners in the audience. Excellent!

450
00:26:37,066 --> 00:26:38,387
You just identified yourselves.

451
00:26:39,786 --> 00:26:44,067
So to me that's an incredible example of cognitive bias.

452
00:26:44,367 --> 00:26:46,588
It's putting two completely disparate things together.

453
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:52,189
And Pink Floyd has said they had absolutely nothing to do with thinking about Wizard of Oz

454
00:26:52,229 --> 00:26:54,430
or looking at that movie or doing anything that lines that up.

455
00:26:55,170 --> 00:27:00,672
But if you line those two things up, you will find as you watch and listen to Wizard of Oz

456
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:05,953
and hear Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, you will see things that start somehow making sense

457
00:27:06,273 --> 00:27:08,154
because your brain wants it to make sense.

458
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:16,036
So I call this planned vertical synchronicity, which is taking something that's one kind

459
00:27:16,076 --> 00:27:21,458
of piece and then just randomly putting another piece on top of it, becoming a layer, and

460
00:27:21,818 --> 00:27:26,300
the listener will automatically try to line those two things up together because if they're

461
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,540
playing together, they must have been intended to play together.

462
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,962
And what's nice about that is that, from an implementation standpoint,

463
00:27:32,728 --> 00:27:36,612
You can start, let's say for example, you can start an ambient piece, and then if something

464
00:27:36,652 --> 00:27:40,416
important happens you can start a percussive piece, and they're both playing at the same

465
00:27:40,476 --> 00:27:40,776
time.

466
00:27:40,896 --> 00:27:47,844
And the player gets the advantage of having something that they do essentially feel like

467
00:27:47,884 --> 00:27:52,308
it's causing those two things to start, and then while they're playing together, things

468
00:27:52,328 --> 00:27:54,230
start lining up and it feels like it was planned.

469
00:27:55,077 --> 00:27:59,960
And it is planned, but exactly the details of how things line up is not necessarily planned.

470
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,744
And how many people here have scored a scene or done sound design on a scene or created

471
00:28:06,804 --> 00:28:11,547
ambience for a scene, and then the director will say, oh man, that was beautiful how you

472
00:28:11,587 --> 00:28:14,229
hit that one moment, and you didn't intend to.

473
00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:14,849
Anybody?

474
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:15,610
Accidental?

475
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:16,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

476
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:18,432
Take credit for that.

477
00:28:19,613 --> 00:28:21,154
Never say, oh, that was an accident.

478
00:28:21,194 --> 00:28:23,755
No, I mean, if you're a composer, say, yeah, I totally planned that.

479
00:28:23,995 --> 00:28:24,396
And that's.

480
00:28:26,476 --> 00:28:26,977
That works well.

481
00:28:27,517 --> 00:28:29,558
Anyway, so here we're going to, I'm just going to show you,

482
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:34,560
I think the reason that one of the things that was intriguing to Brandy

483
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,242
was that I basically said there's an emotional feeling you get from this ambient piece

484
00:28:39,362 --> 00:28:41,983
and there's a different emotional feeling you get from the percussive piece.

485
00:28:42,064 --> 00:28:46,926
And when it's combined, now you get a third emotional feeling.

486
00:28:47,606 --> 00:28:51,568
And she's identified some fingerprints for this by doing this.

487
00:28:51,608 --> 00:28:52,708
So here's the ambient piece.

488
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:13,727
You might recognize this, it shows up in Halo Reach and similar things in every Halo

489
00:29:13,747 --> 00:29:14,167
game ever.

490
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:20,311
And here's the emotional fingerprint.

491
00:29:21,591 --> 00:29:22,712
Not yet, this is that.

492
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:27,252
This is one of the little stories that people said about this piece.

493
00:29:32,115 --> 00:29:33,495
And there's the emotional fingerprint.

494
00:29:35,837 --> 00:29:38,378
So just as an aside to the composers in the audience,

495
00:29:39,739 --> 00:29:43,922
if you ever want to evoke ancient, just have some men singing something.

496
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:48,945
As soon as you do anything that sounds monk-like, boom, ancient. You're going to get that every time.

497
00:29:50,286 --> 00:29:51,006
Okay.

498
00:29:51,847 --> 00:29:53,428
I'm giving away all my secrets, but there you go.

499
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,310
Here's the percussive piece.

500
00:30:05,052 --> 00:30:10,993
You know, and both these pieces can be used by themselves just to evoke basically one kind of mood.

501
00:30:11,013 --> 00:30:12,354
Here's the story of this piece.

502
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:19,995
That's great. Kick the ass.

503
00:30:21,856 --> 00:30:22,136
Yes.

504
00:30:28,622 --> 00:30:32,504
I lost my cursor.

505
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:33,964
There it is.

506
00:30:34,024 --> 00:30:35,625
Okay.

507
00:30:36,885 --> 00:30:39,766
Now, what's interesting about this is when you do a combination, and remember, like I

508
00:30:39,807 --> 00:30:42,988
said, what's fun about these particular pieces, if they're looping or they have different

509
00:30:43,028 --> 00:30:49,350
sections to them, you can start either one first and start the second one and layer it

510
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,831
on top at any moment you want.

511
00:30:51,831 --> 00:30:54,912
The way I showed it last year was I had somebody just click their fingers and I started the

512
00:30:54,952 --> 00:30:57,973
other one, and it never sounded like a mistake to me.

513
00:30:59,535 --> 00:31:00,256
Here's the combination.

514
00:31:04,199 --> 00:31:09,762
And even though these things don't

515
00:31:09,842 --> 00:31:14,125
intentionally line up vertically, your head can't help but...

516
00:31:26,947 --> 00:31:30,868
There's a reason for that downbeat, even with the background music, the ambient part.

517
00:31:30,928 --> 00:31:34,288
Here's the story.

518
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:42,010
And here is the new emotional fingerprint.

519
00:31:45,051 --> 00:31:48,492
So, I think it's interesting to see here, what are the things that...

520
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:56,613
come through from the ambient piece, what are the things that are retained from each

521
00:31:56,673 --> 00:31:59,995
one of these emotional fingerprints, and what are some of the things that like sort of recede.

522
00:32:00,695 --> 00:32:05,758
So we had nothing primal in the first piece, but now primal is pretty interesting, and

523
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:08,280
we had nothing powerful, but powerful is still there.

524
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:14,983
But now this new piece we've got, you know, some foreboding rather than mysterious, which

525
00:32:15,023 --> 00:32:16,404
I think is pretty interesting.

526
00:32:17,164 --> 00:32:17,364
So...

527
00:32:18,819 --> 00:32:24,742
Just looking at this combination, you have three unique emotional fingerprints, and if

528
00:32:24,762 --> 00:32:28,744
you have something as simple as an ambient piece, a percussive piece, and then you know

529
00:32:28,764 --> 00:32:33,527
that you're going to get a different emotion for people when you combine the two.

530
00:32:33,607 --> 00:32:37,529
That's a really powerful tool for a composer who's implementing music in a game.

531
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:39,570
And then I think...

532
00:32:42,132 --> 00:32:42,612
This is you.

533
00:32:43,652 --> 00:32:44,013
Or is this me?

534
00:32:44,033 --> 00:32:44,213
Or you.

535
00:32:44,453 --> 00:32:45,293
You can do this one.

536
00:32:46,073 --> 00:32:46,714
So I'm going to make it up.

537
00:32:46,754 --> 00:32:47,614
What does that have to do with games?

538
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:49,654
This has to do exactly what I just said.

539
00:32:49,774 --> 00:32:54,515
So this is identifying the music that you're writing,

540
00:32:54,595 --> 00:32:56,656
thinking about this range of emotions,

541
00:32:56,756 --> 00:32:59,096
and knowing that when you implement this,

542
00:33:00,117 --> 00:33:02,657
you can have some data that goes ahead of it.

543
00:33:03,217 --> 00:33:05,858
You can maybe test some of these pieces of music

544
00:33:05,898 --> 00:33:07,698
by themselves in a way that gives you some,

545
00:33:08,238 --> 00:33:11,179
maybe just even confirms your own belief about how people

546
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:12,119
are going to respond to it.

547
00:33:12,499 --> 00:33:13,439
And then you can use it.

548
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,542
And I think this is you next.

549
00:33:17,982 --> 00:33:18,262
Sweet.

550
00:33:19,303 --> 00:33:21,965
So what we did to try to really understand

551
00:33:22,725 --> 00:33:24,807
how the emotions are preserved or not

552
00:33:24,987 --> 00:33:26,648
whenever we mix them with video games

553
00:33:27,268 --> 00:33:29,049
is that we took 10 of the music clips

554
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:31,631
from our first study that we ran.

555
00:33:32,432 --> 00:33:37,035
And we also took five video clips from recent games

556
00:33:37,735 --> 00:33:38,956
that lasted about a minute.

557
00:33:39,877 --> 00:33:43,559
And we combined them to make a total of 50 combinations,

558
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,200
completely at random.

559
00:33:45,641 --> 00:33:48,122
So it meant that there were some pieces that were matched

560
00:33:48,162 --> 00:33:50,844
to things that were very, very different from it in nature.

561
00:33:51,384 --> 00:33:53,265
But we wanted to see what would happen, because like

562
00:33:53,305 --> 00:33:56,467
Marty said, people do tend to make order out of chaos.

563
00:33:57,308 --> 00:34:00,430
And they do tend to want to make something fit, even if

564
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:03,531
it's totally weird from what they would normally expect in

565
00:34:03,571 --> 00:34:04,072
that game.

566
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:13,083
And we were really curious to see what would happen, how much of this emotional fingerprint is preserved in the final product after we combine these two things.

567
00:34:14,063 --> 00:34:25,052
So one of the examples that we had was a very sad and reflective piece of music that was combined with this exciting stealthy clip from Assassin's Creed.

568
00:34:26,293 --> 00:34:27,715
And this was the result.

569
00:34:38,468 --> 00:34:41,532
All I can say is that this is a game where humanity is un非常在

570
00:34:41,572 --> 00:34:44,156
There's no need for me to put any of this stuff out there.

571
00:34:44,176 --> 00:34:49,763
I just wanted to remind you guys that society is impossible to resist.

572
00:34:49,783 --> 00:34:52,466
More recently I've learned that with all of that stuff going on,

573
00:34:52,506 --> 00:34:53,347
in this game,

574
00:34:53,407 --> 00:34:55,350
things will end up just the way they are.

575
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:55,670
So don't stop.

576
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,130
It's a game.

577
00:34:56,171 --> 00:34:57,873
And it's hard to get over it.

578
00:34:57,893 --> 00:34:57,993
And...

579
00:35:10,539 --> 00:35:18,445
This transcript was provided by Transcription Outsourcing, LLC.

580
00:35:22,548 --> 00:35:23,489
It really shouldn't work.

581
00:35:23,909 --> 00:35:24,490
It really shouldn't.

582
00:35:25,931 --> 00:35:29,455
What's interesting is that the emotions were so powerful

583
00:35:29,515 --> 00:35:32,518
here that we really do see a significant amount of,

584
00:35:32,558 --> 00:35:36,443
at least reflective, sad was decreased significantly.

585
00:35:37,063 --> 00:35:39,165
And for some reason, serene really pulled out.

586
00:35:39,306 --> 00:35:41,608
Maybe it's because there was a little bit of serenity

587
00:35:41,648 --> 00:35:44,371
to people in just the Assassin's Creed clip by itself.

588
00:35:45,072 --> 00:35:46,953
And also it was there in the music too.

589
00:35:47,193 --> 00:35:49,574
And for some reason, this became much more serene

590
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:50,634
and mysterious.

591
00:35:51,295 --> 00:35:53,355
But was very much related to the music,

592
00:35:53,416 --> 00:35:55,356
but very little related to the visuals

593
00:35:55,416 --> 00:35:56,617
in this particular case.

594
00:35:57,317 --> 00:35:58,398
And we saw this a lot.

595
00:35:58,958 --> 00:36:01,759
Of the 50 combinations that we made,

596
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,841
92% of them had a significant correlation

597
00:36:05,901 --> 00:36:08,282
between the fingerprints of just the music

598
00:36:09,103 --> 00:36:11,744
and the combination of what we got as the overall effect.

599
00:36:12,164 --> 00:36:14,405
So it's just one way of saying that

600
00:36:15,279 --> 00:36:20,243
It's hard for the emotions to not influence your overall emotional impact on people.

601
00:36:20,783 --> 00:36:27,288
Because it's just this very powerful tie to how we feel and what our experience is.

602
00:36:28,308 --> 00:36:33,152
One of the other interesting things here is that we decided to just get five different

603
00:36:33,172 --> 00:36:34,893
kinds of clips from existing games.

604
00:36:36,031 --> 00:36:36,131
and

605
00:36:36,151 --> 00:36:39,593
this is what you're going to see and this is what you're going to hear simultaneously.

606
00:36:39,613 --> 00:36:42,574
And it was still interesting to me some of the clips.

607
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:57,964
I would be like, oh, that would be a cool way to score that scene, and it actually hits

608
00:36:58,004 --> 00:36:58,464
that moment.

609
00:36:58,525 --> 00:37:01,869
Even like, I think, when the camera pulled away in that and you saw the...

610
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:05,554
There was a sort of an emotional feeling in the music that somehow kind of matched up.

611
00:37:06,035 --> 00:37:07,457
And that was cool.

612
00:37:09,139 --> 00:37:09,620
I planned that.

613
00:37:12,904 --> 00:37:14,866
So another theme that we're going to see through here is

614
00:37:14,926 --> 00:37:19,169
just a percentage that sort of represents how related was

615
00:37:19,269 --> 00:37:21,870
this piece to the overall effect versus the visuals.

616
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:24,873
And this is one of the cases where this piece was much more

617
00:37:24,933 --> 00:37:26,914
related than the visuals were.

618
00:37:27,134 --> 00:37:30,096
But we'll see some others that were not quite that way or

619
00:37:30,136 --> 00:37:31,177
were the opposite of that.

620
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:37,562
So of the 8% that didn't have a significant relationship,

621
00:37:38,802 --> 00:37:40,043
they were pretty interesting.

622
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:44,705
So in one case here, we had a very hopeful, joyful,

623
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:48,887
mysterious piece of music matched with Gears of War.

624
00:37:48,907 --> 00:37:52,248
And that's really fun.

625
00:38:28,744 --> 00:38:30,926
See, I can almost make that work. Come on!

626
00:38:45,591 --> 00:38:51,492
That's an example of cognitive dissonance that's just too overwhelming for cognitive bias.

627
00:38:51,512 --> 00:38:58,273
Oh, God. The poor people in this study. We didn't tell them that we were randomizing just random music with the visuals.

628
00:38:59,093 --> 00:39:01,234
Some of the comments at the end of the study would say,

629
00:39:01,694 --> 00:39:08,655
I love Marty's music, but oh my God, what is he thinking?

630
00:39:08,695 --> 00:39:11,776
They had no idea what was happening, so it was kind of a mean trick.

631
00:39:14,991 --> 00:39:19,717
So what we got in the combination here was something that was much more related to the

632
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:24,784
visuals because people just kind of had to reject the fairies and Gears of War on Ice

633
00:39:24,924 --> 00:39:25,625
aspect here.

634
00:39:29,829 --> 00:39:34,553
We did see some new things crop up, like mysterious, but probably just because they felt fairly

635
00:39:34,613 --> 00:39:35,213
confused.

636
00:39:35,253 --> 00:39:39,857
So, definitely it went both ways.

637
00:39:39,917 --> 00:39:44,700
There were definitely some powerful pulls towards the emotions and the music, and some

638
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,982
that had more powerful pulls towards the visuals.

639
00:39:48,323 --> 00:39:52,666
But what was interesting was that there were definitely differences in the types of emotions

640
00:39:52,746 --> 00:39:57,029
that music would bring about versus the types of emotions that visuals were likely to.

641
00:39:58,255 --> 00:40:02,336
So whenever we look at just the music alone and all the 10

642
00:40:02,676 --> 00:40:07,177
pieces that we considered, any of the emotions that were ever

643
00:40:07,277 --> 00:40:10,537
reached in any of the pieces and how much they were reached

644
00:40:10,597 --> 00:40:11,478
is represented here.

645
00:40:12,158 --> 00:40:15,098
So this says that we were able to reach aggressive, very

646
00:40:15,158 --> 00:40:19,499
strongly, mysterious, creepy, stealthy, a whole huge variety

647
00:40:19,579 --> 00:40:20,219
of emotions.

648
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:23,740
At least one piece was able to evoke that emotion fairly

649
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,821
consistently across a population.

650
00:40:25,921 --> 00:40:27,181
It's a very diverse palette.

651
00:40:28,047 --> 00:40:29,687
And granted, there were only five videos.

652
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:31,807
But of the videos we had, they definitely

653
00:40:31,867 --> 00:40:34,568
had some strong pulls to emotion.

654
00:40:34,608 --> 00:40:36,949
But the palette was significantly more limited.

655
00:40:37,829 --> 00:40:40,609
That could have been because we also only pulled five videos

656
00:40:40,649 --> 00:40:42,810
instead of 10 pieces of music.

657
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:46,711
We did intentionally try to pick a fairly diverse set of videos.

658
00:40:46,771 --> 00:40:50,932
But note that this is on a very small set of information here.

659
00:40:51,052 --> 00:40:53,332
So we could be misrepresenting some of the visuals.

660
00:40:54,838 --> 00:41:01,362
But of what we saw, music was able to produce a significantly greater effect in foreboding,

661
00:41:01,442 --> 00:41:08,027
hopeful, powerful, primal, sad, serene, some of these very complex emotions that I don't

662
00:41:08,107 --> 00:41:12,330
know that we'd necessarily be able to see in games without music and without music being

663
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:13,491
able to target those things.

664
00:41:14,211 --> 00:41:18,534
Whereas the visuals were incredibly good at stealthy and heroic, even more so than the

665
00:41:18,574 --> 00:41:19,855
music was in these cases.

666
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:27,824
And also if we look at how much the emotions were able to explain the overall experience,

667
00:41:28,485 --> 00:41:34,449
on average the music alone had about 43% of the experience explained, and the visuals

668
00:41:34,489 --> 00:41:34,829
alone had 33%.

669
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:38,051
And this is randomly applied music too.

670
00:41:38,752 --> 00:41:46,178
So it's possible that the numbers would be even higher in very carefully crafted or well-designed audio experiences.

671
00:41:46,278 --> 00:41:51,382
So it's pretty fascinating that the numbers for music alone were even as high as they were here.

672
00:41:52,663 --> 00:41:56,106
What's also interesting is that even if these numbers were mutually exclusive,

673
00:41:57,007 --> 00:42:02,211
there's still 25% of the overall experience that's not explained by one or the other explicitly.

674
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:08,849
Which is interesting, it's kind of fascinating, because that means 25% is totally new stuff.

675
00:42:09,429 --> 00:42:12,910
New emotions that people did not mention for one or the other.

676
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:18,532
And so what that pretty much means is that you kind of still need guys like Marty.

677
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:24,820
There's still some black magic, there's still some creativity,

678
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:28,942
there's still having to use your gut to know where to put these pieces of music

679
00:42:29,063 --> 00:42:33,725
and what the overall effect is going to have whenever you combine two random

680
00:42:33,745 --> 00:42:37,307
things like that, two artistic forms. You're going to get something

681
00:42:37,387 --> 00:42:40,509
interesting besides just what those two pieces are by themselves.

682
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:45,072
So it's pretty fascinating. So we have one more interlude from Marty.

683
00:42:45,152 --> 00:42:45,372
Yes.

684
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:53,498
So also last year I showed another ambient and percussive piece that went together.

685
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:57,942
The interesting thing about these two pieces were that I didn't think they would go together

686
00:42:57,962 --> 00:43:01,985
because they both had their own key center, they both had their own harmonic rhythm.

687
00:43:03,567 --> 00:43:04,687
They shouldn't have gone together.

688
00:43:06,859 --> 00:43:10,142
And I could not make them not go together and sound like a mistake.

689
00:43:10,182 --> 00:43:12,864
They always, whenever I started one and then started the other,

690
00:43:12,944 --> 00:43:15,165
they eventually seemed like they were in sync.

691
00:43:15,285 --> 00:43:18,688
So this is this particular ambient piece.

692
00:43:18,708 --> 00:43:30,497
And there's this music fingerprint.

693
00:43:30,557 --> 00:43:32,498
Now, granted, it's not a strong harmonic rhythm,

694
00:43:32,538 --> 00:43:35,100
but it does have changes that are happening.

695
00:43:41,609 --> 00:43:43,150
I'm just going to stop it anyway. That's what it does.

696
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:46,913
Here's the percussive, more tense, stealthy thing.

697
00:43:49,816 --> 00:43:52,278
You can see it's in a different key. Related.

698
00:43:58,259 --> 00:44:00,681
And of course, the way I found this is I had these music files up.

699
00:44:00,861 --> 00:44:04,724
I thought I was clicking on one, and it turned out to be these two things.

700
00:44:04,824 --> 00:44:06,826
And it was an accident.

701
00:44:07,486 --> 00:44:09,188
But you should always use your accidents.

702
00:44:09,268 --> 00:44:10,209
So it was fun.

703
00:44:10,669 --> 00:44:16,033
And if you played Reach, you might remember this from the space flight

704
00:44:16,073 --> 00:44:19,977
scene, where these things happen.

705
00:44:20,237 --> 00:44:21,578
I will turn you off now.

706
00:44:21,638 --> 00:44:23,460
There we go.

707
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,362
And so here's the combo.

708
00:44:53,785 --> 00:44:55,046
It's just random, it really is.

709
00:44:55,266 --> 00:44:58,088
There's no money, how many different ways I play these two together,

710
00:44:58,128 --> 00:45:00,169
they'll always end up somehow coming back together.

711
00:45:00,189 --> 00:45:01,190
It's very strange.

712
00:45:02,451 --> 00:45:13,118
So they end in the same key, I don't know why that was.

713
00:45:13,198 --> 00:45:17,641
But, so, what we decided to do then is take something like this

714
00:45:17,761 --> 00:45:21,864
and actually play it with another piece of video.

715
00:45:23,946 --> 00:45:25,506
This is the what?

716
00:45:25,546 --> 00:45:26,527
That's Mass Effect.

717
00:45:26,867 --> 00:45:27,587
From Mass Effect.

718
00:45:27,647 --> 00:45:29,948
And this is what the visuals...

719
00:45:32,428 --> 00:45:33,549
Do I just click on this? Sorry.

720
00:45:34,209 --> 00:45:35,949
Oh no, not that one. Go ahead and keep going through it.

721
00:45:35,989 --> 00:45:37,170
One more. Oh yeah, here's the final combo.

722
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:39,450
So here's the movie of this.

723
00:45:42,151 --> 00:45:43,091
This is just gameplay.

724
00:46:00,525 --> 00:46:15,030
This transcript was provided by Transcription Outsourcing, LLC.

725
00:46:22,865 --> 00:46:24,546
Did you want to talk about these numbers?

726
00:46:25,587 --> 00:46:26,648
I'll talk about numbers.

727
00:46:26,808 --> 00:46:29,190
Okay. Numbers are confusing to me.

728
00:46:31,632 --> 00:46:32,392
Poor Marty.

729
00:46:34,614 --> 00:46:40,118
So what's interesting here is that whenever you look at these two, you see that they are fairly similar pieces.

730
00:46:40,659 --> 00:46:44,762
You know, the mysteriousness, but also kind of serene and moving about.

731
00:46:44,822 --> 00:46:51,407
And whenever you combine them, you do get something that is fairly similar to both of these, but is somewhat more...

732
00:46:51,967 --> 00:46:55,190
But in this case, the visual is more connected to the visuals in this experience than the

733
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:55,610
music.

734
00:46:56,971 --> 00:47:01,614
What is even more interesting is that if we go back one step further to see how the percussive

735
00:47:01,654 --> 00:47:06,838
piece is related to the final combo versus the ambient, we actually don't see very much

736
00:47:06,878 --> 00:47:07,638
of these elements.

737
00:47:08,419 --> 00:47:11,942
And in fact, for the most part, people are completely ignoring.

738
00:47:13,193 --> 00:47:18,717
the contribution of that piece of music, in that they can't seem to reconcile this idea

739
00:47:18,757 --> 00:47:23,320
of something stealthy and tense and exciting and aggressive whenever it's clearly such

740
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,262
of a calm sort of scene.

741
00:47:25,322 --> 00:47:26,122
It's out in the open.

742
00:47:26,162 --> 00:47:27,063
It's not stealthy.

743
00:47:27,103 --> 00:47:30,345
It's kind of just an out-wandering, exploring kind of scene.

744
00:47:31,126 --> 00:47:34,867
And somehow they just managed to not recognize those feelings.

745
00:47:35,207 --> 00:47:38,989
But this piece is even more related than the combo on its own.

746
00:47:39,409 --> 00:47:43,290
The sort of serene, mysterious piece that I guess reconciled better for people

747
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:46,251
than just the percussive piece on its own.

748
00:47:46,591 --> 00:47:52,133
So what that kind of says is that if you have these two pieces, these two musical elements...

749
00:47:53,056 --> 00:47:57,700
One of them, if it makes more sense, people, their minds might latch on to that, and then

750
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:00,323
just somehow kind of ignore the piece that doesn't make sense.

751
00:48:00,803 --> 00:48:03,185
So it's, again, making order out of chaos.

752
00:48:03,225 --> 00:48:07,369
You give them things that they can't reconcile, they can't make sense of, they're happy to

753
00:48:07,409 --> 00:48:08,510
latch on to the ones that do.

754
00:48:09,671 --> 00:48:10,772
So pretty fascinating.

755
00:48:11,312 --> 00:48:11,573
I will...

756
00:48:12,102 --> 00:48:16,248
Okay, well I want to make sure we leave time for some questions because I'm sure there are a lot.

757
00:48:16,308 --> 00:48:22,297
We've got a few minutes left, but the thing I want you to remember is that it's important.

758
00:48:23,579 --> 00:48:25,602
Sorry, that image will never get out of your head.

759
00:48:26,669 --> 00:48:34,572
But it is really, really important to talk to your developers and talk about the feelings.

760
00:48:34,732 --> 00:48:38,754
And when I work with the designers, especially level designers and the designers on the game,

761
00:48:39,674 --> 00:48:42,976
I'm always asking, what's the emotions?

762
00:48:42,996 --> 00:48:45,216
What's the emotional journey that you want the player to go through,

763
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:48,118
even in the smallest encounter and overall?

764
00:48:48,198 --> 00:48:51,639
Because as composers and people who, you know...

765
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:57,146
Compose music for games. This is something that we really, really can help with.

766
00:48:57,446 --> 00:49:01,110
And it's, it's, it's, you have to be able to figure out a way to talk to some of these

767
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:04,414
guys about feelings, because their feelings are usually not very broad.

768
00:49:04,434 --> 00:49:09,981
And this is a great way to do it. And then, of course, I think that some of the

769
00:49:10,021 --> 00:49:11,302
crazy stuff is the...

770
00:49:13,969 --> 00:49:17,990
We all know that if we can score a scene and really work on it,

771
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:20,151
that's going to be the crafted sequence of music,

772
00:49:20,451 --> 00:49:21,911
and we're going to be able to do well on that.

773
00:49:21,951 --> 00:49:26,453
But it's those moments of gameplay that we don't have control over,

774
00:49:26,513 --> 00:49:29,074
the moment-to-moment decisions the player makes.

775
00:49:29,594 --> 00:49:33,395
And if we can figure out ways of crafting an emotional journey for them

776
00:49:33,455 --> 00:49:36,336
that seems to line up, it's incredibly powerful.

777
00:49:36,976 --> 00:49:39,217
And music is one of the best ways to do that.

778
00:49:40,057 --> 00:49:44,800
And then the final thing here, and this is not a super strong ending, but here we go.

779
00:49:46,321 --> 00:49:54,825
I am now convinced that it's okay to use research to support my own inner goose and the overall goose of the studio.

780
00:49:55,926 --> 00:49:59,427
You know, this was a really fascinating experiment for me.

781
00:50:00,528 --> 00:50:06,131
To a certain extent, it confirmed what my instincts were, which is always nice for me to have that happen.

782
00:50:06,591 --> 00:50:11,745
But it also gave me some extra ammunition, and I'm able to talk a little bit more intelligently.

783
00:50:13,378 --> 00:50:16,701
uh... with that with the uh... some of the big brains in the studio about the

784
00:50:16,741 --> 00:50:20,503
importance of emotions and that we actually have ways that we are

785
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:23,426
controlling that we are actually kind of rational about

786
00:50:23,866 --> 00:50:26,608
and this is a uh... this is a really really great tool

787
00:50:27,048 --> 00:50:29,811
i'm not exactly sure how many use it in the in the future uh...

788
00:50:30,091 --> 00:50:34,134
uh... we didn't we were not asking anybody whether they liked

789
00:50:34,574 --> 00:50:37,456
music or this particular music we weren't asking their opinions about what

790
00:50:37,476 --> 00:50:40,439
kind of music they liked it was had nothing to do with their opinions it all

791
00:50:40,479 --> 00:50:41,079
had to do with

792
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:46,901
This is the music you have to listen to and this is the, we want you to tell us what your emotions are.

793
00:50:46,921 --> 00:50:50,542
And they didn't even have the choice of like yucky or like I hate this.

794
00:50:50,642 --> 00:50:54,444
So they had to like figure out a way to talk about their actual emotions.

795
00:50:54,904 --> 00:51:00,265
They did write in confusing periodically or boring if they didn't like the visuals or something.

796
00:51:00,365 --> 00:51:03,886
But it's okay, we don't have to know about that part, hence the muzzle.

797
00:51:04,086 --> 00:51:04,346
All right.

798
00:51:04,837 --> 00:51:08,621
I'm going back. I didn't want that one image to be up while we're answering questions.

799
00:51:09,061 --> 00:51:12,664
So thanks for coming. That's our emotional puppeteers talk.

800
00:51:12,884 --> 00:51:14,506
And now we're going to open for questions. Thank you.

801
00:51:16,187 --> 00:51:16,827
Thank you, Brandi.

802
00:51:17,328 --> 00:51:18,049
Thank you, Martin.

803
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:22,833
If anybody has questions, yeah, line up. There's mics in these two aisles.

804
00:51:22,953 --> 00:51:26,656
And it would be helpful to be in front of a mic.

805
00:51:27,136 --> 00:51:27,336
Go ahead.

806
00:51:28,403 --> 00:51:31,485
The question is when you have two pieces of music lined up on top of each other,

807
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:34,907
are those literally just two pieces of music lined up on top of each other,

808
00:51:34,927 --> 00:51:39,089
or do you do anything specific mix-wise to make them match in a way that

809
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:43,731
maybe helps what you want to do or just interested to know more about your process there?

810
00:51:45,553 --> 00:51:50,936
No, I actually, there are times when I might decide that this one piece is a little bit

811
00:51:50,976 --> 00:51:56,058
too loud to match with the other one, so if I know I'm going to have that percussive piece

812
00:51:56,078 --> 00:51:59,180
go over the top of this ambience, I might say, yeah, that'll be better to be down 6

813
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:00,281
dB or something.

814
00:52:01,241 --> 00:52:07,044
But I'm listening to it, and I know that these files mix best at a certain level, and so

815
00:52:07,064 --> 00:52:09,686
that's just built into the implementation.

816
00:52:12,584 --> 00:52:16,507
I had a question, do you guys know about if there's any more research that had been done

817
00:52:16,567 --> 00:52:18,269
with similar studies, different games?

818
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:21,931
Not necessarily in games that I could find.

819
00:52:22,432 --> 00:52:27,616
The research I found before about just emotions in music is out there.

820
00:52:27,656 --> 00:52:30,978
In fact, that's actually one of the ways we chose the words that we wanted to include

821
00:52:31,038 --> 00:52:34,601
for how people describe their feelings from that.

822
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:38,824
Because I was just wondering, if they played the game Tony Hawk, do they do more kickflips

823
00:52:38,844 --> 00:52:39,965
when they listen to loud music?

824
00:52:42,376 --> 00:52:45,497
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know that a lot of people have actually tried studying this stuff.

825
00:52:45,557 --> 00:52:47,698
I think it's kind of a hard thing to nail and we're not...

826
00:52:48,058 --> 00:52:51,119
We can't even be 100% sure that this is really what people are feeling.

827
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,800
But it's interesting to take a stab at it.

828
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:58,142
I don't think from what I've been able to find that many people have really tried very much.

829
00:52:58,422 --> 00:53:01,904
We did see some... You sent me some, like, really unreadable research,

830
00:53:01,984 --> 00:53:04,104
but it, for the most part, it...

831
00:53:05,363 --> 00:53:09,004
It seemed very simplistic, at least for me, I couldn't take anything from it, it was like

832
00:53:09,024 --> 00:53:15,026
a single, like, I feel sad, or I feel happy and there'd be this, you know, kind of boring piece.

833
00:53:15,126 --> 00:53:20,188
And so, um, that's why when we talked about it I said, you know, the only kind of music I like

834
00:53:20,428 --> 00:53:22,028
is music that has some sort of...

835
00:53:23,549 --> 00:53:27,129
and complexity, something where it feels like it's taking you from a beginning and a middle

836
00:53:27,189 --> 00:53:31,030
and an end. And that's the kind of music most people actually wanna listen to. So how do

837
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:36,651
we actually have something that happens over time be reflected in a study? So the stories

838
00:53:36,751 --> 00:53:39,412
and the multiple words was really important to us.

839
00:53:39,432 --> 00:53:41,813
Thank you.

840
00:53:41,833 --> 00:53:45,893
Um, I wanted to ask about the word cloud. You just mentioned how you got some of it

841
00:53:45,933 --> 00:53:49,634
from other studies, but would you change the words that you used in the future? Were,

842
00:53:49,694 --> 00:53:51,315
were there some words that you thought didn't?

843
00:53:52,045 --> 00:53:52,626
work out.

844
00:53:54,007 --> 00:53:59,612
Yeah, actually, some of the ones that we found either that people didn't choose because

845
00:53:59,632 --> 00:54:04,236
our particular audience just won't choose them or some that ended up being fairly synonymous.

846
00:54:04,917 --> 00:54:10,262
So I think the words glorious and joyful were very rarely chosen on any of the pieces of

847
00:54:10,342 --> 00:54:12,704
music or videos that we chose.

848
00:54:12,724 --> 00:54:16,828
And even though in other research they found that people associated those words with music,

849
00:54:17,088 --> 00:54:18,789
perhaps maybe our audience just doesn't.

850
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:21,671
And since we're wanting to keep that set of words limited,

851
00:54:21,991 --> 00:54:23,651
there may be room for a couple of other words

852
00:54:23,711 --> 00:54:26,012
that we didn't get to add in, maybe that other people wrote

853
00:54:26,092 --> 00:54:29,373
in, that it would be really nice to have that space for.

854
00:54:29,393 --> 00:54:32,294
So there are definitely some that can be changed out,

855
00:54:32,434 --> 00:54:34,674
especially if there's a particular feeling that you're

856
00:54:34,714 --> 00:54:35,495
trying to get.

857
00:54:35,835 --> 00:54:38,155
It's certainly important to trade in some of those, but

858
00:54:38,195 --> 00:54:40,576
trade it into a place where it's as synonymous as

859
00:54:40,636 --> 00:54:42,917
possible to keep the diversity available to people.

860
00:54:45,576 --> 00:54:49,860
I had a question for Marty. I remember reading a while back, I think it was about Mark Twain,

861
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:53,142
but don't quote me. There's a man who was really fascinated by steamboats. He thought

862
00:54:53,162 --> 00:54:56,645
they were just the most magical thing he'd ever seen. And so when he studied all about

863
00:54:56,665 --> 00:55:00,328
them and learned exactly how they worked, he found that the magic was gone. It's like

864
00:55:00,368 --> 00:55:02,870
he just didn't relate to them in the same way, and so he went and did something else.

865
00:55:03,211 --> 00:55:06,574
I was wondering, as a composer, as you delve really into the numbers, do you find that

866
00:55:07,434 --> 00:55:10,857
limits you or liberates you in your writing? Does it change your writing at all?

867
00:55:11,689 --> 00:55:12,710
That's a really good question.

868
00:55:13,572 --> 00:55:15,895
Certainly, I'm going to be on the lookout for that.

869
00:55:16,055 --> 00:55:19,439
But I would say, having as long a career as I've had doing

870
00:55:19,479 --> 00:55:20,881
music, I'm not going to be able to do that.

871
00:55:21,914 --> 00:55:27,055
The, I've read some studies where they talk about left brain, right brain, and the more

872
00:55:27,095 --> 00:55:31,256
you study something that's more of a right-brained activity, the more your left brain is engaged.

873
00:55:31,356 --> 00:55:35,376
So I tend to have trouble just listening and enjoying music.

874
00:55:35,817 --> 00:55:38,497
I have to like consciously put myself in a different space.

875
00:55:39,277 --> 00:55:42,698
And I sometimes call it, I put a different hat on.

876
00:55:42,778 --> 00:55:46,718
So like, when I come in and I'm like, I'm going to try to write some music, I have to

877
00:55:46,758 --> 00:55:49,639
put on this hat that is not analytical.

878
00:55:50,399 --> 00:55:58,161
And I'm just trying to approach, and if I improvise something that actually gives me a little shiver or chill, which sounds strange,

879
00:55:58,221 --> 00:56:06,162
but I listen to what I did and I say that caused some sort of an emotional response in my soul.

880
00:56:06,783 --> 00:56:08,423
So I wanted to hold on to that.

881
00:56:08,543 --> 00:56:10,603
And then the next day I come in and I'm very analytical.

882
00:56:10,723 --> 00:56:14,544
I look at everything that's... I analyze it. I figure out a way to develop it.

883
00:56:14,584 --> 00:56:15,765
I figure out how it's going to be used.

884
00:56:17,329 --> 00:56:21,773
It does take some of the magic out, which is why I probably don't even have the ability

885
00:56:21,813 --> 00:56:25,076
to tell any kind of an interesting story when I'm listening to the pieces.

886
00:56:25,936 --> 00:56:28,499
I almost immediately go into an analytical mode, which is hard.

887
00:56:31,227 --> 00:56:36,950
So I think anybody who's been a composer for a long time probably runs into that periodically

888
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:39,992
and sometimes you just have to listen to talk radio or something.

889
00:56:42,053 --> 00:56:47,556
I don't listen to music usually in the car, I don't have headphones on when I'm at home.

890
00:56:48,537 --> 00:56:54,700
It's sometimes really hard to have that sort of just initial emotional experience for someone

891
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:55,761
who's just working in it.

892
00:56:56,459 --> 00:57:01,241
And of course, the numbers situation here is like I'm, you know, I want to make sure

893
00:57:01,281 --> 00:57:05,463
that that doesn't stomp on anything that's precious to me.

894
00:57:05,943 --> 00:57:08,324
But it's really pretty interesting.

895
00:57:08,464 --> 00:57:09,525
So we'll see.

896
00:57:10,331 --> 00:57:14,935
Yeah, and we actually found that if we included any questions that even allowed users to become

897
00:57:14,975 --> 00:57:19,979
analytical, they tended to deprioritize or not even be able to get into writing their

898
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:22,161
stories or telling us about emotions.

899
00:57:22,221 --> 00:57:27,526
So we completely intentionally left out any sort of critical or analytical types of questions

900
00:57:27,586 --> 00:57:28,787
in this study.

901
00:57:28,807 --> 00:57:33,130
It was all intended to be very imaginative, creative, emotive, to be able to keep people

902
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:35,532
in that sort of mindset as they went through it.

903
00:57:39,565 --> 00:57:40,608
I think this gentleman was in line.

904
00:57:40,769 --> 00:57:41,311
Oh, OK, sure.

905
00:57:43,861 --> 00:57:45,622
My question is about working with clients.

906
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:53,586
When a client hires you for a gig and they say that they have these X, Y, and Z specific emotions

907
00:57:53,626 --> 00:57:58,948
that they want the music to represent, and then they send you some examples that are completely different

908
00:57:58,968 --> 00:58:01,309
than what you would do to represent those emotions.

909
00:58:01,649 --> 00:58:02,950
What should be paramount?

910
00:58:02,970 --> 00:58:06,271
Should you go and do what they have asked you for,

911
00:58:06,492 --> 00:58:11,094
or should you blow them away with your interpretation that exactly represents the emotions?

912
00:58:11,174 --> 00:58:11,394
Sure.

913
00:58:11,514 --> 00:58:13,135
That's, of course, you're asking...

914
00:58:13,692 --> 00:58:16,214
a dangerous question of someone who is not going to give you good advice.

915
00:58:18,896 --> 00:58:23,580
This has worked for me and I've done talks about this at other GDCs where I call it the

916
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:27,583
prima donna technique and for some reason it kind of works for me and I don't recommend

917
00:58:27,603 --> 00:58:28,223
it for everybody else.

918
00:58:30,265 --> 00:58:35,149
But to a certain extent I think any artist that's going to be respected has to have some

919
00:58:35,229 --> 00:58:38,071
strong passion about what they think is the right way to approach things.

920
00:58:39,882 --> 00:58:45,687
And there's a thing in the film business, which is temp scores,

921
00:58:45,787 --> 00:58:48,709
where an editor and a director will get together,

922
00:58:48,749 --> 00:58:51,171
and they'll take something that's existing,

923
00:58:51,191 --> 00:58:51,991
and they'll cut to it.

924
00:58:52,572 --> 00:58:54,013
And then they show that to the composer.

925
00:58:54,713 --> 00:58:58,756
And even at Bungie, when our cinematics team decides,

926
00:58:58,776 --> 00:59:00,758
well, we need to cut this thing, and we need some music,

927
00:59:00,818 --> 00:59:02,039
can we use some of your music?

928
00:59:02,259 --> 00:59:04,601
Or I got this piece I really like, and I'm like, look,

929
00:59:04,661 --> 00:59:07,583
you can cut your scene to any piece of music you want.

930
00:59:08,321 --> 00:59:13,203
You're going to, that'll help you get a pace, that'll help you cut on the beat, that'll help you do whatever it is you want, that's fine.

931
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:15,984
But don't ever play that for me.

932
00:59:17,525 --> 00:59:23,868
And that's my prima donna thing coming through, but the reason I don't want that to happen is because as a creative person I only have two possible responses.

933
00:59:24,548 --> 00:59:36,854
Either I hear that piece and I hear what they were trying to do, how they cut it, and I try to do something close, because I know that's what they like, or I try to do the opposite of what they did, because I'm...

934
00:59:37,174 --> 00:59:39,436
And, you know, trying to be a jerk and...

935
00:59:39,716 --> 00:59:41,939
But I don't have any fresh approach.

936
00:59:41,979 --> 00:59:43,920
I don't just get to see the scene and think,

937
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:45,202
okay, what would I like to do?

938
00:59:45,762 --> 00:59:47,564
Now, I don't mind talking to them and having them

939
00:59:47,644 --> 00:59:49,606
tell me the emotional story they want to make sure

940
00:59:49,626 --> 00:59:50,146
it gets through.

941
00:59:50,226 --> 00:59:51,768
That's actually really, really helpful.

942
00:59:52,268 --> 00:59:54,991
But I don't necessarily want to hear what they cut the music to.

943
00:59:57,414 --> 01:00:07,317
And I think that's a real shame because it doesn't allow the composer to really have

944
01:00:07,357 --> 01:00:08,678
a fresh approach.

945
01:00:09,178 --> 01:00:13,659
And getting a fresh approach after being sort of polluted by hearing something else is really

946
01:00:13,699 --> 01:00:14,159
difficult.

947
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:15,340
So, yeah.

948
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:15,600
Thank you.

949
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:21,922
I'm curious about whether you take into account cultural biases in doing these kinds of things

950
01:00:21,982 --> 01:00:23,302
because I feel like a...

951
01:00:23,958 --> 01:00:27,738
A lot of times, the associations that we have with certain types of music are kind of acquired

952
01:00:28,239 --> 01:00:30,879
through just whatever we kind of grew up listening to.

953
01:00:31,559 --> 01:00:32,739
And I'm wondering if that came into play.

954
01:00:32,819 --> 01:00:34,040
Yeah, that's a great question.

955
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:35,140
And we're almost out of time.

956
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:36,260
I want to get this last person in too.

957
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:36,440
Oh, sure.

958
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:40,981
But what I would say is, like, yeah, as you can tell, the music that was selected and

959
01:00:41,001 --> 01:00:45,822
the kind of music that I happen to like, it's certainly completely from a Western film scoring,

960
01:00:45,842 --> 01:00:48,282
you know, programmatic sort of approach.

961
01:00:49,822 --> 01:00:53,063
And yeah, that's not necessarily going to be reflected in other cultures.

962
01:00:53,934 --> 01:01:00,980
Thankfully, Western culture is so dominant that it pretty much translates to a pretty

963
01:01:01,001 --> 01:01:01,801
good global market.

964
01:01:01,821 --> 01:01:08,687
But I really don't know, it would be fascinating for me to even understand some indigenous

965
01:01:08,808 --> 01:01:13,352
kinds of like Japanese, like some of the Japanese singing, I'm like, I don't even know what

966
01:01:13,372 --> 01:01:14,753
emotion they're trying to evoke.

967
01:01:14,913 --> 01:01:17,776
But I know that there's something really deep and there's a whole story there.

968
01:01:18,997 --> 01:01:20,037
That would be fascinating to see.

969
01:01:20,077 --> 01:01:24,841
Yeah, we did not collect that information about people, their ethnicity and where they were from.

970
01:01:24,961 --> 01:01:27,602
But we targeted only people who live in the United States.

971
01:01:28,243 --> 01:01:32,145
So at least people who have had significant experience to Western culture.

972
01:01:32,506 --> 01:01:36,869
So we're probably seeing a primarily Western response to the information we got here.

973
01:01:36,889 --> 01:01:38,410
Okay, one more quick question.

974
01:01:38,997 --> 01:01:48,602
Most of the music that you've shown and most of the games that you've shown either have this soft and serene or depressing or combative action.

975
01:01:49,042 --> 01:01:56,125
What about scary or lovey-dovey? Because that also exists in games and that seems to be completely missing.

976
01:01:56,366 --> 01:01:57,926
We actually had that, but go ahead.

977
01:01:58,147 --> 01:02:02,989
We did. We had that in there. We definitely had one piece that was completely creepy. Which one was that?

978
01:02:04,526 --> 01:02:05,927
I don't know that it will pull back up again.

979
01:02:06,087 --> 01:02:08,209
But we had one that was completely creepy.

980
01:02:08,449 --> 01:02:11,371
The problem is that we have limited time and we have limited things to show.

981
01:02:11,791 --> 01:02:14,994
But we definitely had 14 pieces of music that intentionally represented.

982
01:02:15,014 --> 01:02:17,295
There was one that was noted to be very romantic.

983
01:02:17,375 --> 01:02:20,658
There was one that was noted to be very eerie and scary.

984
01:02:20,678 --> 01:02:22,879
And so we tried to get at all those things.

985
01:02:22,959 --> 01:02:24,340
We just don't have them all here to show.

986
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:29,044
But we definitely wanted to get at that sort of breadth of emotion.

987
01:02:30,082 --> 01:02:33,945
And that's the thing I think that especially the composers can take away is that the thing

988
01:02:34,245 --> 01:02:38,229
I felt really good about was that in terms of the range and depth of human emotions,

989
01:02:38,449 --> 01:02:42,012
music can really cover a wide spectrum.

990
01:02:42,653 --> 01:02:46,956
And that's a great toolbox for all of us to be able to take into these projects we're

991
01:02:46,996 --> 01:02:47,357
working on.

992
01:02:48,218 --> 01:02:49,138
All right, so we're out of time.

993
01:02:49,178 --> 01:02:50,019
Thanks very much for coming.

994
01:02:50,039 --> 01:02:50,359
And... 1
