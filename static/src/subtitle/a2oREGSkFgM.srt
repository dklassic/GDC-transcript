1
00:00:06,555 --> 00:00:11,197
Right, so today I'm going to be talking a bit about the art of Dear Esther and the environments

2
00:00:11,217 --> 00:00:15,458
of the game and how the environments are an important part of the storytelling process

3
00:00:15,478 --> 00:00:19,800
of the game. But I think the first thing I should really do is just kind of go over the

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,682
concept of Dear Esther and some of the history behind it and its origins just so that you

5
00:00:24,722 --> 00:00:30,044
can get a better idea of why the environments are such an important part of the storytelling

6
00:00:30,084 --> 00:00:30,864
process of the game.

7
00:00:30,884 --> 00:00:32,025
So...

8
00:00:33,883 --> 00:00:39,648
Dearest has started out life as a source engine mod in 2008 and was originally conceived by

9
00:00:39,848 --> 00:00:46,694
Dan Pinchbeck as an experiment to see what would happen if you stripped out traditional

10
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:51,538
gameplay from a first person game space and instead just tried to use that space to do

11
00:00:51,578 --> 00:00:52,239
something different.

12
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:55,601
outside of the normal traditions of gameplay.

13
00:00:56,401 --> 00:00:58,202
And in this case, it was just designed to see

14
00:00:58,242 --> 00:01:00,423
if you could use that space to tell

15
00:01:00,603 --> 00:01:03,745
like a deep ambiguous story about a dying man

16
00:01:03,785 --> 00:01:06,306
stranded on a Hebridean island,

17
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:08,027
coming to terms with a tragic loss.

18
00:01:08,607 --> 00:01:09,928
And to kind of tell this story

19
00:01:09,988 --> 00:01:12,289
just through exploring the environment

20
00:01:12,389 --> 00:01:15,371
and being absorbed in the story itself.

21
00:01:17,882 --> 00:01:19,903
And as a research project, it actually did pretty well.

22
00:01:19,963 --> 00:01:22,685
It got released, and it got 50,000 downloads

23
00:01:22,725 --> 00:01:24,606
within the first six months.

24
00:01:24,946 --> 00:01:27,647
And it gained quite a cult following in the modding scene.

25
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:28,988
And it's kind of around this time

26
00:01:29,028 --> 00:01:30,789
that I stumbled across it myself.

27
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:34,571
And although I found it really captivating, really inspiring,

28
00:01:34,611 --> 00:01:37,233
I couldn't help but feel that it wasn't quite fulfilling

29
00:01:37,273 --> 00:01:40,314
its true potential, especially being built upon this idea

30
00:01:40,374 --> 00:01:44,076
that it's around exploring environments and telling

31
00:01:44,096 --> 00:01:45,237
a story through the environments.

32
00:01:47,457 --> 00:01:51,860
So in the original mod you had this fantastically engaging voiceover narrative that plays as you

33
00:01:52,301 --> 00:01:57,745
explore throughout the island and that not only gives you glimpses into the protagonist's past

34
00:01:57,825 --> 00:02:02,429
and his reasons for being on the island but more importantly more interestingly for me was that it

35
00:02:02,449 --> 00:02:07,113
gives you all these glimpses into the history of the island itself and its past inhabitants and

36
00:02:07,133 --> 00:02:09,675
all the various plagues and misfortunes that have

37
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,572
that have plagued them throughout the history of the island.

38
00:02:12,912 --> 00:02:17,837
And for me, this is the most interesting part of the experience,

39
00:02:17,897 --> 00:02:21,220
because all of these little bits of information that were coming through in the voice narrative

40
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,763
were really helping me to build this world in which the story takes place.

41
00:02:27,065 --> 00:02:32,029
But the problem I saw with the original mod was that this kind of visual detail that was coming through,

42
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:34,652
this audio detail that was coming through the narrative,

43
00:02:35,618 --> 00:02:37,859
really wasn't being represented with the environments.

44
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:40,920
And as a result, there was this kind of real disconnection

45
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,582
between the visual experience and the auditory experience.

46
00:02:45,283 --> 00:02:45,363
And.

47
00:02:47,745 --> 00:02:52,269
As an environment artist, I kind of felt really drawn to this project because I felt that,

48
00:02:52,649 --> 00:02:56,873
you know, I had this theory for a while that, you know, the backdrop that the environments

49
00:02:56,893 --> 00:03:03,199
of the games shouldn't just be just a backdrop, a passive thing in which a game takes place.

50
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:08,884
And here I saw a great opportunity to make the environments more of a backdrop and make

51
00:03:08,904 --> 00:03:12,867
it like an immersion tank to really draw the player in and make it an integral part of

52
00:03:12,907 --> 00:03:14,189
the storytelling process.

53
00:03:15,678 --> 00:03:25,047
And today I'm just going to take you through some of the processes that I went through in order to achieve this and also some of the philosophies and some of the lessons that I learned along the way.

54
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,622
And I think one of the most important lessons that I

55
00:03:29,662 --> 00:03:33,184
learned that really made the impact on me as an artist and

56
00:03:33,324 --> 00:03:36,445
the project in general was early on when I was wrestling

57
00:03:36,465 --> 00:03:39,427
with the idea of how I was going to create this really

58
00:03:39,447 --> 00:03:41,248
immersive world.

59
00:03:42,029 --> 00:03:45,951
And I started out into the slightly naive belief that in

60
00:03:45,991 --> 00:03:51,454
order to achieve immersion, you needed to be as realistic

61
00:03:51,494 --> 00:03:51,894
as possible.

62
00:03:51,934 --> 00:03:54,076
You needed to create this really believable world.

63
00:03:56,077 --> 00:03:59,039
And at the time, I was working with the source engine.

64
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:02,442
And as some of you may or may not know, it's not

65
00:04:02,562 --> 00:04:05,504
particularly designed to work with large

66
00:04:05,544 --> 00:04:06,405
outdoor environments.

67
00:04:07,085 --> 00:04:10,088
And as a result, I kind of ended up having to cut out any

68
00:04:10,128 --> 00:04:11,769
normal maps, any fancy shading.

69
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:14,951
And it went straight back to only being able to use diffuse

70
00:04:15,012 --> 00:04:15,852
maps on the textures.

71
00:04:17,776 --> 00:04:20,157
And as a result, in some of the early art tests, which you can

72
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,678
see here, the terrain just looked really flat and

73
00:04:22,718 --> 00:04:23,479
unconvincing.

74
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:27,661
And it became quickly apparent that realism just wasn't going

75
00:04:27,681 --> 00:04:28,101
to happen.

76
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:32,383
And in retrospect, it was probably one of the best

77
00:04:32,423 --> 00:04:34,224
things that happened to the project and myself as an

78
00:04:34,304 --> 00:04:37,205
artist, because it really forced me to go back to the

79
00:04:37,225 --> 00:04:41,447
drawing board and reassess what this idea was, what really

80
00:04:41,527 --> 00:04:43,808
made immersion and what the qualities were

81
00:04:43,828 --> 00:04:44,588
that made immersion.

82
00:04:46,652 --> 00:04:52,458
And I kind of started looking into other mediums and more prominently paintings and just trying

83
00:04:52,518 --> 00:04:58,545
to get some inspiration and see if this kind of immersive quality was evident anywhere else.

84
00:04:58,645 --> 00:05:03,310
And I started to be drawn towards this kind of impressionistic style of painting.

85
00:05:04,231 --> 00:05:07,913
There was just something about it, something about this mix of the real and surreal, this

86
00:05:08,513 --> 00:05:16,399
detail and perceived detail that you see in some of these paintings that I thought really mirrored sort of D'Arresta's strange and ambiguous story.

87
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,343
But not only that, I found some of these paintings like so atmospheric, so

88
00:05:23,483 --> 00:05:29,007
immersive and so so absorbent that I really just felt inspired to kind of

89
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:36,318
take just to study these images and try and take some of the qualities that made these

90
00:05:36,678 --> 00:05:43,579
images, even though they're not representations of photo reality, and adapt that into my work,

91
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:47,800
see if I could create this kind of immersive quality in it. So the first thing I tried to

92
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,521
do is just kind of identify some of what I thought were the key qualities of this

93
00:05:52,821 --> 00:05:56,382
impressionistic style, and for me it was kind of this really strong sense of

94
00:05:57,547 --> 00:06:02,312
lighting that kind of creates the atmosphere in some of these paintings is kind of like soft

95
00:06:02,992 --> 00:06:06,956
Colors just like really soft lighting and I really like this idea of

96
00:06:07,857 --> 00:06:09,258
evoking emotion over

97
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:15,965
Recreating reality so only creating enough detail and enough fidelity within the image to kind of

98
00:06:16,691 --> 00:06:19,452
bring across the impression of that scene,

99
00:06:19,472 --> 00:06:20,652
the emotion of that scene.

100
00:06:21,113 --> 00:06:23,173
And I also like the idea of using the color palette

101
00:06:23,213 --> 00:06:25,734
to reinforce this kind of emotional quality

102
00:06:25,774 --> 00:06:27,775
and get the atmosphere and mood

103
00:06:27,835 --> 00:06:30,736
just through the colors of the picture.

104
00:06:33,555 --> 00:06:35,537
So I went back to my original art test,

105
00:06:35,577 --> 00:06:38,058
and I tried to adapt some of these qualities into my work,

106
00:06:38,118 --> 00:06:40,340
and just tried to make it a lot more softer,

107
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,201
and I made the lighting more ambient,

108
00:06:42,281 --> 00:06:45,583
and just kind of embraced this kind of flatness

109
00:06:45,643 --> 00:06:46,504
that was there before,

110
00:06:46,564 --> 00:06:49,426
and tried to make it a lot more painterly in style.

111
00:06:49,466 --> 00:06:51,787
And already it was starting to come together

112
00:06:51,867 --> 00:06:53,728
and look a lot more of a beautiful,

113
00:06:53,828 --> 00:06:55,149
interesting place to explore.

114
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:57,651
And this kind of really inspired me to continue on

115
00:06:58,131 --> 00:07:00,553
later on in level in the development when

116
00:07:01,814 --> 00:07:05,636
I realized that breaking three of these boundaries of this realism

117
00:07:06,136 --> 00:07:10,399
really allowed me to play with some of the designs of the island

118
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:16,762
and the colors and the kind of symbolic imagery that's in there,

119
00:07:17,823 --> 00:07:22,626
which I wouldn't have been able to do being stuck inside this kind of realistic realm.

120
00:07:24,407 --> 00:07:25,727
And it really helped towards the end of the game,

121
00:07:25,747 --> 00:07:28,229
where there's this kind of real twist on the story

122
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:30,110
and things become a lot more dreamlike and surreal.

123
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,741
which I'll come to later in the presentation.

124
00:07:33,502 --> 00:07:35,423
But just to sum up this point, I really

125
00:07:36,103 --> 00:07:39,365
felt like I learned that realism isn't

126
00:07:39,405 --> 00:07:40,866
the holy grail for immersion.

127
00:07:41,807 --> 00:07:43,628
In fact, realism doesn't have anything to do with it.

128
00:07:43,668 --> 00:07:45,889
It's not the fidelity of the content that mattered at all

129
00:07:45,929 --> 00:07:46,209
to me.

130
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:48,371
It was actually, it turned out that it

131
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:50,052
was the message and experience that you

132
00:07:50,072 --> 00:07:52,793
betray for the content that really matters

133
00:07:52,813 --> 00:07:53,934
in terms of immersion.

134
00:07:55,435 --> 00:07:56,856
So speaking of that content, I think

135
00:07:56,896 --> 00:07:58,296
I should really just quickly talk about.

136
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:04,201
how it was built to connect the story back to the environment.

137
00:08:04,882 --> 00:08:10,527
And I think the best way to do this, just kind of show an example scene from the original mod

138
00:08:10,547 --> 00:08:14,350
and show how it's built up and improved upon in the remake

139
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:20,896
and some of the most important steps in the process in order to kind of build this connection back up.

140
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:25,592
So here we got a scene from the original mod in which the

141
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:29,535
narrator references at several points in the story where he

142
00:08:29,595 --> 00:08:32,157
says he describes a shipwreck in the bay and the pollution

143
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:35,119
that's been caused to the island and the damage done by

144
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:37,781
it, and also the various supplies that he's looted from

145
00:08:37,841 --> 00:08:38,722
it.

146
00:08:39,482 --> 00:08:42,144
And it's a really good example of where the narrative details

147
00:08:42,204 --> 00:08:44,686
didn't match up to the visual details, where there's this

148
00:08:44,726 --> 00:08:47,548
kind of real disconnection between the auditory experience

149
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:48,569
and the visual experience.

150
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:59,041
And it was also an area that had, that ended up having a huge potential to expand upon the story just through the environment and just through this one narrative detail.

151
00:09:00,783 --> 00:09:04,068
But first, the connection really starts at the beginning of the...

152
00:09:05,418 --> 00:09:08,280
the kind of building of this terrain, at least it did for me,

153
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,823
because in my mind, this terrain is kind of like the stage

154
00:09:11,863 --> 00:09:14,285
in which the story takes place.

155
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:18,369
So I like to think of a certain amount of things

156
00:09:18,689 --> 00:09:22,552
to do while I'm designing the environment.

157
00:09:22,652 --> 00:09:26,015
So for me, I wanted to create something

158
00:09:26,055 --> 00:09:29,118
within the terrain that would be unique to this aspect

159
00:09:29,158 --> 00:09:29,799
of the story.

160
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,961
And in this case, I wanted to kind of frame it

161
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:33,902
within the story so that.

162
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:38,246
When they talk about the shipwreck, they could identify it within the environment.

163
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:42,508
And not only that, but I wanted to expand upon the game experience as well.

164
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:47,951
So I wanted to expand upon the idea of exploration and offer something that was interesting to explore.

165
00:09:48,372 --> 00:09:53,335
And I kind of came up with this idea of these huge sand dunes that just stretched across the bay.

166
00:09:54,295 --> 00:09:59,202
And just to make it a lot more interesting to explore and just kind of give it the shipwreck,

167
00:09:59,222 --> 00:10:01,885
this unique identity when it eventually comes in.

168
00:10:02,586 --> 00:10:05,651
And this comes in in the next stage where you start to add in the details.

169
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:09,796
And this is the stage where you really start connecting the story to the environment, or

170
00:10:09,816 --> 00:10:10,417
at least I did.

171
00:10:12,744 --> 00:10:15,386
As you can see in the small corner there, you can see a

172
00:10:15,646 --> 00:10:18,408
picture of the original scene from the mod.

173
00:10:18,808 --> 00:10:21,250
And you just have this kind of little trawler with a few boxes

174
00:10:21,471 --> 00:10:23,072
floating around it, which represent the

175
00:10:23,352 --> 00:10:24,333
pollution on the island.

176
00:10:25,013 --> 00:10:28,396
But here I've really tried to up the scale of the scene,

177
00:10:28,576 --> 00:10:31,839
really try to make it a more poignant, dramatic aspect of

178
00:10:31,859 --> 00:10:36,422
the story, just so that the environment is really, it

179
00:10:36,462 --> 00:10:39,045
becomes an integral part of the story within the

180
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:39,725
environment there.

181
00:10:42,405 --> 00:10:47,549
But not only that, I just made sure that the details of this piece were actually consistent with the story as well,

182
00:10:47,609 --> 00:10:55,055
because this can be a real immersion breaker if you don't really think about this kind of this depth within the art of the environment.

183
00:10:55,075 --> 00:11:04,823
So in this case, it had to be a fairly recent wreck in order for the pollution to still have a hold and for the supplies to still be salvageable.

184
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:14,902
But going beyond this, I actually just expanded upon this aspect of pollution to try and expand,

185
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:16,223
add depth to the story.

186
00:11:16,383 --> 00:11:21,004
And I did this by just making the pollution caused by it just evident all over the island.

187
00:11:21,024 --> 00:11:25,666
So it infests the soil, the sand, and the grass, and it's just everywhere.

188
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:30,828
And it really emphasizes the feeling that this island is kind of this miserable place,

189
00:11:30,868 --> 00:11:32,889
this unpleasant place to inhabit.

190
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:42,267
And again, I just expanded upon this idea further by adding in other shipwrecks to the island.

191
00:11:43,348 --> 00:11:47,252
Some of them more recent, but more importantly, some of them much, much older.

192
00:11:49,547 --> 00:11:54,030
And what this does is just to suggest that these shipwrecks,

193
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,132
these kind of disasters have been plaguing the island

194
00:11:56,172 --> 00:11:57,213
for hundreds of years.

195
00:11:57,993 --> 00:12:01,356
And it just adds adding depth to that one narrative detail.

196
00:12:02,036 --> 00:12:04,178
And again, it's just building upon this idea

197
00:12:04,218 --> 00:12:06,719
that the island is this really cursed place.

198
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:11,323
And what these details do is just add consistency

199
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:13,064
to support the reality of the game world,

200
00:12:13,084 --> 00:12:14,245
the reality of the story.

201
00:12:14,865 --> 00:12:17,047
And so it's more about building a past

202
00:12:17,087 --> 00:12:17,847
as well as a present.

203
00:12:19,292 --> 00:12:20,593
which I think is a really important thing.

204
00:12:22,194 --> 00:12:26,156
And finally, I just decided that later on in the

205
00:12:26,236 --> 00:12:30,719
development to try and connect the protagonist to the

206
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:33,581
island, the character that you're portraying in some way

207
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:34,502
through the environment.

208
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:37,043
And I started to add in all these little small details

209
00:12:37,063 --> 00:12:40,686
that connect to him that are randomized and just serve to

210
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:43,127
reward the exploration aspect of the game.

211
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:45,349
So every time you play it, you get slightly

212
00:12:45,409 --> 00:12:46,489
different objects spawned.

213
00:12:48,353 --> 00:12:50,914
And these just serve to offer a connection to the protagonist's past.

214
00:12:51,494 --> 00:12:56,995
And these are just a few examples of some of the items that you can find just around the shipwreck area.

215
00:12:57,456 --> 00:13:02,537
So you've got like the Jaws of Life, a partially burnt car seat, and a defibrillator.

216
00:13:03,077 --> 00:13:08,038
These are all kind of slightly out of place, and they just serve to kind of link back to his past,

217
00:13:08,058 --> 00:13:09,998
to kind of like give you a glimpse into...

218
00:13:10,979 --> 00:13:13,379
this tragic event that led him here in the first place.

219
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,520
But there's also other details that are outside of this

220
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,240
as well that kind of expand upon the story

221
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,861
that's not portrayed throughout the narrative itself.

222
00:13:23,621 --> 00:13:25,981
For example, in the lower left hand corner here,

223
00:13:26,001 --> 00:13:28,282
you have like some burnt divorce papers

224
00:13:28,342 --> 00:13:30,462
and foreclosure on a mortgage.

225
00:13:31,282 --> 00:13:34,083
And these kind of just serve to kind of offer

226
00:13:34,103 --> 00:13:36,043
a slightly different interpretation of the story

227
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,123
in the background behind it.

228
00:13:42,771 --> 00:13:45,611
So, the reason for doing this is kind of to make

229
00:13:46,172 --> 00:13:48,772
the protagonist, not just this presence on the island,

230
00:13:48,792 --> 00:13:50,632
so you're not just this person just floating around,

231
00:13:51,092 --> 00:13:52,973
but you're actually part of the history

232
00:13:52,993 --> 00:13:53,973
of the environment as well.

233
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:58,254
It's kind of like making him part of the island itself.

234
00:13:59,514 --> 00:14:04,675
And I think there's just, moving on from that

235
00:14:04,715 --> 00:14:06,495
just a little bit, I just want to talk about

236
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:09,756
one other thing that I thought was really instrumental

237
00:14:09,836 --> 00:14:10,416
and kind of.

238
00:14:12,275 --> 00:14:15,217
bringing the immersion of the game up to a whole new level.

239
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,299
And it was something I almost missed.

240
00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:20,942
I was pretty much through the second level of the game.

241
00:14:22,363 --> 00:14:24,705
The whole world, everything was really coming together.

242
00:14:24,745 --> 00:14:27,967
The story was really becoming connected to the environment.

243
00:14:28,347 --> 00:14:31,430
But there was this real invisible barrier, this real

244
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,011
disconnection between.

245
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:36,573
the visual experience still and I couldn't quite figure it out and

246
00:14:37,313 --> 00:14:40,715
one day I had this screenshot open and I was just kinda looking at it and I was just thinking

247
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:43,217
well it looks fine, I can't really figure out what it is

248
00:14:43,237 --> 00:14:48,059
and I picked up my mouse and I tried to move it around, this screenshot and I was like

249
00:14:48,219 --> 00:14:50,961
at first I was like, oh okay this is just caffeine deprivation

250
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:55,763
but it suddenly occurred to me that the reason I couldn't discern this between

251
00:14:56,714 --> 00:14:59,616
the actual game itself was that everything was just completely static.

252
00:14:59,656 --> 00:15:02,018
There was no feeling of dynamism in the world.

253
00:15:02,038 --> 00:15:05,620
There was no feeling that this was a living, breathing space.

254
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:11,104
And this was really, I think, what this last disconnection was being caused by.

255
00:15:12,485 --> 00:15:15,047
And so, hopefully this will work.

256
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:19,670
Play video.

257
00:15:23,793 --> 00:15:24,053
Okay.

258
00:15:28,588 --> 00:15:29,148
Ah, here we go.

259
00:15:29,568 --> 00:15:31,568
Yeah, so I started to add in all these like

260
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:34,709
little random elements to kind of really bring in

261
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:36,769
this movement and this organic feeling to the world.

262
00:15:36,789 --> 00:15:38,390
So you've got this wind blowing

263
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,350
and the grass blowing in the wind

264
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,370
and you've got all these leaves being picked up by that

265
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:46,291
and you've got the kind of clouds scrolling along the sky,

266
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:48,612
you've got the water flowing into the bay,

267
00:15:48,632 --> 00:15:53,373
you've got the waves splashing against the shore,

268
00:15:53,413 --> 00:15:54,333
you've got mist.

269
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,660
evaporating from the water.

270
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,182
You've got all these different elements that kind of create this

271
00:16:00,782 --> 00:16:02,644
this kind of real organic feel to the world.

272
00:16:02,704 --> 00:16:03,865
It just makes it much more,

273
00:16:04,465 --> 00:16:06,067
it made it much more of a believable world.

274
00:16:06,107 --> 00:16:07,448
It just really, it really just

275
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:10,431
jumped the immersion level up massively.

276
00:16:10,451 --> 00:16:13,813
And it's just, I think it was such an important part of

277
00:16:14,114 --> 00:16:17,877
of really making it, the world, this kind of believable place.

278
00:16:19,915 --> 00:16:22,218
So finally there's just one last thing I think I should talk about.

279
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:28,024
And it's probably one of the more complex things that I use to tell the story within the game.

280
00:16:28,044 --> 00:16:30,747
And that's something I call subliminal signposting.

281
00:16:31,848 --> 00:16:37,254
So, subliminal signposting is just quite simply a way of using the environment to

282
00:16:37,534 --> 00:16:40,938
unconsciously guide the player through some of the more figurative aspects of the story.

283
00:16:41,741 --> 00:16:44,623
which are not directly conveyed through the narrative.

284
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:50,208
And most of these signposts can usually be symbolic in nature.

285
00:16:50,248 --> 00:16:53,570
You can use them to navigate the player around the environment,

286
00:16:53,951 --> 00:16:55,392
which is the more traditional way

287
00:16:55,412 --> 00:16:56,773
to use subliminal signposts.

288
00:16:56,793 --> 00:17:00,576
So using the aerial to guide the player in the right direction.

289
00:17:01,176 --> 00:17:03,658
But I've used them a lot more.

290
00:17:03,738 --> 00:17:05,379
I think a lot of better examples are

291
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,741
some of the more symbolic ones.

292
00:17:07,181 --> 00:17:09,142
And these are used to portray some of the...

293
00:17:11,235 --> 00:17:15,457
some of the protagonist's kind of state of mind, his thought, his feelings, his memories

294
00:17:15,497 --> 00:17:19,998
and emotions, and really build upon the possibility of the island or parts of the island being

295
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:25,780
kind of unreal or a delusion of his imagination conjured up in a kind of fever or kind of

296
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,500
a purgatory.

297
00:17:29,643 --> 00:17:42,845
And I think this is most prevalent during the caves level of the game, where the protagonist is kind of at this height of his delusion, he's broken his leg, he's got this infection, and he's been taking all these painkillers, and he's kind of reached this crescendo when he descends into the caves.

298
00:17:43,285 --> 00:17:54,768
And I really wanted to create here some kind of subtle break from the physical reality of the previous levels, and kind of make it more of a symbolic journey through his own body, his own mind, and his inner psyche.

299
00:17:55,528 --> 00:18:00,952
And just because it's the turning point in the game where he kind of comes to terms with the events that happen,

300
00:18:02,573 --> 00:18:03,754
which I thought was really fitting.

301
00:18:03,794 --> 00:18:10,459
So, as a result, there were really quite a number of prominent subliminal signposts here.

302
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:19,405
And so, for example, in this level, one of the first scenes you come across, one of the first rooms you come across is this room here.

303
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:24,012
This is just really representative of his heart,

304
00:18:24,172 --> 00:18:26,253
which is one of the most important things in the story.

305
00:18:26,293 --> 00:18:28,434
It's emotion, it's the turmoil.

306
00:18:29,674 --> 00:18:30,835
And it wasn't supposed to represent

307
00:18:30,855 --> 00:18:32,795
in any kind of literal sense or physical sense.

308
00:18:33,276 --> 00:18:35,236
It's just there to serve to make an impression.

309
00:18:35,997 --> 00:18:39,518
So this is kind of like very loose colors,

310
00:18:39,738 --> 00:18:41,699
just the colors, the shapes and everything like that

311
00:18:41,739 --> 00:18:43,960
are really designed to just bring this oppression across.

312
00:18:44,911 --> 00:18:48,374
And I think in this case, I chose this one because it's a little bit more literal.

313
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:54,000
If you focus on the blue colors in the scene, you get this kind of very loose blue outline,

314
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,061
this kind of heart shape.

315
00:18:56,262 --> 00:18:59,045
But later on, it can be even more subtle than that.

316
00:19:01,497 --> 00:19:06,458
And you've got other areas such as this, this kind of is towards the end of the cave's level

317
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,499
where you kind of go into this cave and there's all these writings and stuff around the walls.

318
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:14,481
This is really symbolic of his kind of inability to figure out the events that happened, this

319
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:18,602
kind of fractured state of mind that led him here and his kind of tormented mind and the

320
00:19:18,642 --> 00:19:20,763
infection and various other things.

321
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,264
And it all leads up to this probably most poignant scene in the game.

322
00:19:25,257 --> 00:19:26,659
which is kind of like a mix between

323
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:29,122
uh... the kind of literal signposting

324
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:31,245
and the symbolic signposting

325
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,548
and it's literal in the case that you've got this kind of

326
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:36,092
it's hard to see here but it's like this car wreck

327
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:36,893
uh...

328
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:42,918
But it's symbolic in the fact that it's submerged beneath the bottom of the ocean,

329
00:19:43,158 --> 00:19:44,858
and it looks like it's been submerged for decades.

330
00:19:45,338 --> 00:19:50,480
And it's kind of representative of his repressed memories of this event,

331
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,261
and it's coming to terms with these memories.

332
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:57,602
So it's a good example of where the environment can really represent these thoughts and feelings.

333
00:19:59,915 --> 00:20:07,260
I think the last really strong image comes at the end of the caves level when you're exiting out and you're exiting into the next level.

334
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:12,664
And this whole room is just designed to look like this giant eye and you're going through the iris of this eye.

335
00:20:13,104 --> 00:20:18,008
And it's, you know, again, it's not completely literal, but in this case, it's kind of a bit more literal.

336
00:20:18,488 --> 00:20:18,628
But.

337
00:20:20,096 --> 00:20:22,418
It's very symbolic of this kind of exit of the

338
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,780
of the inner psyche and back into some kind of reality.

339
00:20:27,261 --> 00:20:28,181
And it's...

340
00:20:28,862 --> 00:20:30,943
I didn't want to create this kind of like really

341
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:35,026
surreal, like literal representation of all these things

342
00:20:35,326 --> 00:20:37,728
in a level. I didn't want to do kind of a Max Payne event where you're

343
00:20:37,848 --> 00:20:38,968
following a trail of blood around.

344
00:20:39,369 --> 00:20:42,411
I still wanted to maintain the reality of the game world that I built up.

345
00:20:43,011 --> 00:20:49,575
So doing it in a subtle way really kind of just creates this idea that people can interpret it however they want.

346
00:20:49,655 --> 00:20:54,478
They might take something else away with it, and they might just think it's a case, but at the end of the day,

347
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:58,341
it's a nice way to communicate the emotional aspects of the story.

348
00:20:59,361 --> 00:21:07,627
So yeah, just to conclude, I really believe that choosing an art style shouldn't really be an aesthetic choice.

349
00:21:08,622 --> 00:21:13,767
It should really be a choice of being able to define your experience and support the goals within that experience.

350
00:21:14,588 --> 00:21:20,353
And it can also open up opportunities for you to communicate with your audience in new and interesting ways.

351
00:21:21,674 --> 00:21:31,563
And in this case, choosing the impressionistic style really allowed me to express the unreal and the surreal aspects of the story and really play with that within the environment.

352
00:21:32,717 --> 00:21:34,377
But not only that, but it's not just

353
00:21:34,437 --> 00:21:35,857
about creating a physical landscape.

354
00:21:36,497 --> 00:21:39,378
For me, it's also about creating an emotional space

355
00:21:39,438 --> 00:21:40,598
in which the player can navigate,

356
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:44,639
and using that space to really define the experience.

357
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:49,120
So all these details, the small, the large, the literal,

358
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:53,261
the figurative, are really the glue

359
00:21:53,281 --> 00:21:56,842
that adds depth to the story and the environment,

360
00:21:56,902 --> 00:22:00,383
and really helps to create this immersive world that's

361
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:02,303
full of mystery just waiting to be explored.

362
00:22:03,344 --> 00:22:07,609
And if there's any questions, hopefully I've got time.

363
00:22:11,654 --> 00:22:11,974
Thank you.
