00:00:06,382 --> 00:00:11,487
I am Olivia Wood. I work at Failbetter Games as a writer, narrative designer, editor and

2
00:00:11,507 --> 00:00:16,312
content manager and support and because we do everything. I was recently acknowledged

3
00:00:16,352 --> 00:00:23,119
by BAFTA scheme for my editing and writing work in video games. And this is Failbetter

4
00:00:23,139 --> 00:00:28,985
Games. We're a London-based indie studio and are nearly ten years old. That's old in the

5
00:00:29,025 --> 00:00:29,685
games industry, right?

6
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:36,343
We are known for Fallen London, Sunless Sea and Sunless Skies, which we launched in January

7
00:00:36,443 --> 00:00:43,089
this year. Sunless Sea and Sunless Skies are downloadable premium games. We self-published

8
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:50,395
them using a combination of Kickstarter and Early Access. But I'm going to focus on Fallen London.

9
00:00:50,956 --> 00:00:57,341
Why? Fallen London is fairly unusual. It's a 10-year-old free-to-play browser game that is

10
00:00:57,441 --> 00:00:58,302
still profitable.

11
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:03,655
It's also entirely built with narrative. There is no story gameplay divide.

12
00:01:05,296 --> 00:01:08,457
I am here to explain how we adapted our free-to-play browser game

13
00:01:08,957 --> 00:01:13,259
to enable an increased reliable income stream for the company in the long term.

14
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,902
To explain how we monetized Fallen London and the challenges we face in running it,

15
00:01:21,322 --> 00:01:22,602
I'll need to explain its design.

16
00:01:26,306 --> 00:01:36,410
In Fallen London, London has been dragged underground into a world where death isn't permanent, cats can talk and ominous space bats are de facto rulers of the city.

17
00:01:37,171 --> 00:01:39,352
It's a world of light horror and dark humour.

18
00:01:40,712 --> 00:01:44,834
Our players adopt characters who have come down from the surface to London underground.

19
00:01:45,635 --> 00:01:54,078
There, they live out their lives as a member of Victorian society, engaging in romances, crimes, dangerous escapades and occasionally taking tea with devils.

20
00:01:55,314 --> 00:01:58,837
Fallen London is a universe in the capital U Marvel sense.

21
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:01,298
It is both the cornerstone of our business

22
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:03,720
and launchpad for standalone sequels.

23
00:02:06,182 --> 00:02:07,523
So how is it designed?

24
00:02:11,185 --> 00:02:13,507
The game is very firmly interactive fiction.

25
00:02:14,348 --> 00:02:16,589
All gameplay is in the form of narrative choices.

26
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,692
Equal weight is given to the choice to punch a thug

27
00:02:20,192 --> 00:02:22,273
or to the choice to gossip with your aunt,

28
00:02:22,614 --> 00:02:24,015
probably over a plate of fresh scones.

29
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:28,090
However, Fallen London is not branching narrative.

30
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,131
There is not one mostly linear plot that splits at key points

31
00:02:32,231 --> 00:02:33,992
to possibly rejoin later on.

32
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:39,073
Instead, the underlying world model is one of thousands of variables

33
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:40,513
that we call qualities.

34
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:42,833
If I slip and mix up the two, I'm talking about the same thing.

35
00:02:43,794 --> 00:02:45,914
We can look these up from anywhere else in the game.

36
00:02:47,094 --> 00:02:49,615
Content is unlocked by combinations of variables.

37
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,135
Each piece of content contains a choice

38
00:02:52,455 --> 00:02:54,456
and each choice in the game can change a variable.

39
00:02:56,156 --> 00:02:58,837
The use of variables means that we can surprise players

40
00:02:58,877 --> 00:03:01,437
with callbacks to decisions they have made in earlier content

41
00:03:01,957 --> 00:03:03,798
in an entirely separate section of the game.

42
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:07,838
And the variables themselves are narrative tools.

43
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:10,819
This image is a crop from my own character.

44
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:12,659
These are all variables.

45
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,560
I'm dangerous and persuasive.

46
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,800
I'm a diplomat and a spy.

47
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,821
I'm also an agent of the devils.

48
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:23,242
So how is the game played?

49
00:03:25,848 --> 00:03:30,130
Players explore the city of Fallen London. There is content in every area of the map.

50
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:35,872
It all feeds into a sense of exploration so that players are not just exploring stories within a

51
00:03:35,912 --> 00:03:42,714
space, they're exploring the space itself. While players traverse the space of the game,

52
00:03:43,075 --> 00:03:45,735
the game is mainly about their exploration of narrative.

53
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:52,598
Content can be in the form of brief vignettes or storylines, which are the closest analogue

54
00:03:52,618 --> 00:03:54,078
to quests of varying lengths.

55
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:58,904
Some content is served to the player in a randomized way via their card deck.

56
00:03:59,585 --> 00:04:02,506
Some is always available until the player becomes ineligible for it.

57
00:04:03,247 --> 00:04:07,189
Here, clicking on the card deck reveals four options for the player to dig into.

58
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:13,573
Once I've chosen a card, I'm presented with a snippet of narrative and a choice.

59
00:04:13,593 --> 00:04:15,274
Here's an example.

60
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:17,255
The player witnesses a scuffle.

61
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:21,417
In response, do they assist the lady, the revolutionary?

62
00:04:22,213 --> 00:04:26,034
Or do they assist the urchin who is doing a much worse job at pickpocketing than he thinks?

63
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:30,156
Of course, I would assist the urchin because I'm not a monster.

64
00:04:32,436 --> 00:04:37,378
The choice changes variables. The player has become more persuasive. They have another favour

65
00:04:37,398 --> 00:04:42,320
from the urchins. They have been given a variable that triggers a clandestine rendezvous elsewhere

66
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:42,720
in the game.

67
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:47,462
So variables underpin everything in the game.

68
00:04:47,942 --> 00:04:50,963
And we track everything from the fairly traditional quality of wounds

69
00:04:51,064 --> 00:04:53,605
to inciting a simian revenge.

70
00:04:55,185 --> 00:04:56,626
So what you have with Fallen London

71
00:04:56,826 --> 00:04:59,387
is a complex system of interlocking stories and vignettes

72
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:02,188
that track player behaviour to enable callbacks

73
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,569
to almost any choice in the game.

74
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,331
So what is Fallen London's place in Failbetter's business

75
00:05:09,591 --> 00:05:10,992
and why is it so important?

76
00:05:12,053 --> 00:05:13,973
It is our only free-to-play game.

77
00:05:15,013 --> 00:05:19,255
We primarily produce downloadable pre-premium games, Sunless Sea and Sunless Skies.

78
00:05:20,075 --> 00:05:24,577
We spend years working on these games and until we launch we do not know how they will do.

79
00:05:25,597 --> 00:05:30,059
At the same time our company does not want to have to crunch and we want to exist in the long term.

80
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,942
Fallen London de-risks our premium games. It ensures that we have a reliable income stream

81
00:05:37,363 --> 00:05:40,484
that insulates us from the boom and bust nature of premium games.

82
00:05:43,785 --> 00:05:47,146
So how did we set up Fallen London in such a way that it would support the company?

83
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,847
Well, originally, it had a more traditional free-to-play setup.

84
00:05:51,888 --> 00:05:54,069
We have an in-game currency called Fate.

85
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:57,390
Once a player had bought Fate for real-world money,

86
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,831
it could be used for a variety of one-off purchases throughout the game.

87
00:06:02,092 --> 00:06:05,793
It could also purchase certain improvements to the gameplay experience for a month,

88
00:06:06,273 --> 00:06:07,474
but it didn't auto-renew.

89
00:06:08,174 --> 00:06:10,175
In a way, it was like a proto-subscription.

90
00:06:10,755 --> 00:06:12,275
We called it Exceptional Friendship.

91
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:18,391
How can the player spend fate? What are those one-off purchases?

92
00:06:19,532 --> 00:06:23,553
The stories within Fallen London are explored via a series of choices.

93
00:06:24,313 --> 00:06:25,654
Each choice takes an action.

94
00:06:26,474 --> 00:06:29,095
The game only allows a limited number of actions per day.

95
00:06:30,696 --> 00:06:32,677
Players can use fate to refresh their actions.

96
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,638
They can also use it to refresh the opportunity deck

97
00:06:36,098 --> 00:06:38,339
to play more of the randomized deck content.

98
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,141
And they can use fate to open fate-locked choices.

99
00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:48,335
Sometimes these react, these result in items that are hard or impossible to get with free content.

100
00:06:48,895 --> 00:06:54,199
Sometimes they reveal unexplored lore. The player can also open fate-locked storylines.

101
00:06:54,839 --> 00:07:00,763
Some storylines are simply not free. Here, the golden colored choice is fate-locked. It's part

102
00:07:00,803 --> 00:07:06,086
of a storyline about tracking a serial killer, Jack of Smiles. If you take that choice, for a

103
00:07:06,146 --> 00:07:12,770
while you, the player, will become that serial killer. These fate monetization options are all

104
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,390
still in the game.

105
00:07:15,281 --> 00:07:18,322
The pro to subscription, the one-off monthly package, is not.

106
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:22,683
Before explaining what we turned it into, I'll briefly clarify what it was.

107
00:07:23,703 --> 00:07:26,124
The player could buy this monthly package for 20 fete,

108
00:07:26,324 --> 00:07:27,004
which came to about $4.

109
00:07:28,265 --> 00:07:31,125
This meant that the player would no longer be exposed to adverts.

110
00:07:31,745 --> 00:07:34,966
They would also get a second action candle and a higher total action pool,

111
00:07:35,146 --> 00:07:36,727
meaning they'd be able to play more each day.

112
00:07:38,907 --> 00:07:40,108
But we were missing a trick.

113
00:07:41,113 --> 00:07:47,136
We decided to change the exceptional friendship into a rolling monthly subscription paid for with real world currency.

114
00:07:47,956 --> 00:07:51,638
In 2015, for a game that could be played on mobile, this was unusual.

115
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,640
We also raised the price. It's now $7 a month.

116
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,502
What did we do to sell this to the players to make it seem that this was worthwhile?

117
00:08:02,803 --> 00:08:05,804
We added a limited time subscriber exclusive story each month.

118
00:08:06,672 --> 00:08:10,893
We judged that we could increase the price because of the perceived high value of our stories.

119
00:08:11,913 --> 00:08:16,274
These subscriber stories can be bought individually later for fate, but for an

120
00:08:16,314 --> 00:08:21,816
equivalent cost higher than if the player had bought a subscription. Thus, the subscriber

121
00:08:21,856 --> 00:08:27,537
stories continue to generate revenue beyond the initial subscription. This is the art of an

122
00:08:27,577 --> 00:08:32,779
exceptional story from last year, Little Pandemonium, which was very popular and quite horrific.

123
00:08:34,459 --> 00:08:35,420
Anyway, it turns out...

124
00:08:35,902 --> 00:08:41,343
Our decision to implement monthly subscriptions was definitely the right one. Now a large minority

125
00:08:41,383 --> 00:08:46,204
of our monthly active users are subscribers and when combined with the fate paid aspects of the

126
00:08:46,244 --> 00:08:51,045
game, Failbetter has a reliable income that both supports the development of Full London and

127
00:08:51,126 --> 00:08:57,007
enables long-term planning of other ventures. It takes the risk out of our premium products by

128
00:08:57,107 --> 00:09:01,768
massively reducing our monthly burn and gives us a fan base we can point towards our other works.

129
00:09:04,813 --> 00:09:07,995
Having a monthly subscriber story has benefits beyond the income.

130
00:09:08,656 --> 00:09:10,237
They let us experiment,

131
00:09:10,977 --> 00:09:13,518
as they provide a consistent feedback loop with our audience.

132
00:09:14,439 --> 00:09:15,880
They let us learn what players like,

133
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,321
so that we can create more of that kind of content

134
00:09:18,381 --> 00:09:20,262
for both the subscribers and the free game.

135
00:09:22,243 --> 00:09:24,625
The subscription stories give us a regular opportunity

136
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:26,206
to highlight different parts of the setting.

137
00:09:27,306 --> 00:09:29,367
They enable us to add lore to fill in gaps

138
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:31,949
or to create new areas to later use for free content,

139
00:09:31,969 --> 00:09:32,789
so they're very efficient.

140
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:34,310
And...

141
00:09:34,763 --> 00:09:36,465
they drive engagement with free content.

142
00:09:37,245 --> 00:09:38,907
Players particularly like their choices

143
00:09:38,967 --> 00:09:41,349
having an impact on the free content of Fallen London.

144
00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:45,171
A subscriber story need only unlock one repeatable vignette

145
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:47,453
in the free part of the game, but that's enough.

146
00:09:48,274 --> 00:09:50,055
It reminds the players of adventures

147
00:09:50,075 --> 00:09:51,116
their characters have been through,

148
00:09:51,516 --> 00:09:53,678
and it respects the choices they've made in their stories.

149
00:09:54,739 --> 00:09:58,021
By having free content reflect choices made in paid content,

150
00:09:58,602 --> 00:10:00,583
players feel like the decisions they made matter,

151
00:10:00,984 --> 00:10:02,565
and that they last beyond subscriptions.

152
00:10:03,225 --> 00:10:03,906
It feels fair.

153
00:10:06,812 --> 00:10:09,053
So how do you manage such a game and keep it profitable?

154
00:10:09,474 --> 00:10:11,455
There are three main areas to address.

155
00:10:14,957 --> 00:10:17,438
The first is the sheer volume of writing and designing.

156
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:21,100
The base game needs free content to draw players in,

157
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,562
to make them feel that the game is worth investing in,

158
00:10:24,402 --> 00:10:25,983
financially or emotionally.

159
00:10:26,683 --> 00:10:29,365
But even though we have built up a huge amount of free content,

160
00:10:29,465 --> 00:10:30,606
we have to keep adding more.

161
00:10:32,026 --> 00:10:34,468
This ensures that Fallen London doesn't stagnate.

162
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:39,465
that it continues to feel like a thriving city to those who don't have a subscription but might

163
00:10:39,485 --> 00:10:43,830
get one and to those who have a subscription but need something to keep them engaged between each

164
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:49,936
month's subscriber content. We add, very roughly, 10,000 words of free content a year.

165
00:10:51,677 --> 00:10:54,380
That does not include the content we write for our seasonals.

166
00:10:55,317 --> 00:10:59,840
We also have law-based seasonal content to give the in-game world a sense of time passing.

167
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,563
While we reuse some of the content, we still add about 20,000 words of free seasonal content a year.

168
00:11:07,404 --> 00:11:11,246
Then we have the subscriber stories. They're another 100,000 words a year.

169
00:11:12,507 --> 00:11:17,490
That's a lot of writing, especially for a content team of three people who at the same time in two

170
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:23,133
years were also making a premium game containing 800,000 words. That's a content burden.

171
00:11:25,348 --> 00:11:26,429
So how do we manage that?

172
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,430
Under these kind of pressures, it

173
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,971
is easier to create stories within specific parameters

174
00:11:33,051 --> 00:11:35,552
than to go away and write a Fallen London story.

175
00:11:36,552 --> 00:11:38,933
So our subscription stories have themes,

176
00:11:39,613 --> 00:11:41,614
three months dedicated to a particular aspect

177
00:11:41,674 --> 00:11:42,554
of Fallen London life.

178
00:11:43,394 --> 00:11:45,755
It makes breaking down the vast amount of lore easier.

179
00:11:47,096 --> 00:11:49,136
It also gives every three subscription stories

180
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:52,577
an external arc, so that while a player needn't play all three,

181
00:11:52,697 --> 00:11:53,718
they're encouraged to do so.

182
00:11:55,568 --> 00:11:58,170
We have built Fallen London as a deep living world.

183
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,351
Instead of creating a set of stories,

184
00:12:00,451 --> 00:12:02,252
we've created a setting for stories.

185
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:04,713
The game of Fallen London is the world

186
00:12:04,753 --> 00:12:05,914
in which all the stories are set.

187
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:09,235
This means that the world can be lore rich,

188
00:12:09,515 --> 00:12:11,356
and we can leave a lot of questions unanswered

189
00:12:11,436 --> 00:12:13,637
without making it feel that we're creating mysteries

190
00:12:13,677 --> 00:12:14,458
for mystery's sake,

191
00:12:14,978 --> 00:12:16,539
or don't even know what's happening ourselves.

192
00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:18,820
But when we come back to those areas

193
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,221
looking for inspiration to write,

194
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,702
it's already there in the layers of lore

195
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,522
we've already set up.

196
00:12:26,483 --> 00:12:28,045
We don't treat story as linear plot.

197
00:12:28,645 --> 00:12:30,747
Our game is a place and players explore stories

198
00:12:30,827 --> 00:12:31,568
within that place.

199
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:34,250
This all means that repeatable content

200
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,272
has a real world analog in the daily grind,

201
00:12:36,692 --> 00:12:39,475
and that adds to the life of the city of Fallen London.

202
00:12:40,596 --> 00:12:41,577
It has to be well-written,

203
00:12:42,117 --> 00:12:43,698
but because it serves a narrative,

204
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:46,080
world-building and role-playing function,

205
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:47,902
it's possible to create content

206
00:12:47,942 --> 00:12:50,464
that players deliberately set out to complete many times,

207
00:12:50,985 --> 00:12:52,846
rather than just view as filler and grind.

208
00:12:53,927 --> 00:12:54,528
For example,

209
00:12:55,306 --> 00:12:57,907
Players can act as a temporary governor of Port Carnelian.

210
00:12:58,787 --> 00:13:02,328
Many players actively seek to raise their successful terms as governor

211
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:05,629
as high as they can, playing the content over and over.

212
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:07,969
To some, it's a score to boast about,

213
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:10,510
but for others, it is part of their character's career.

214
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:17,272
There are several periods in the year when we release free content,

215
00:13:17,652 --> 00:13:18,972
often with monetized aspects.

216
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,893
These are our seasonal events that I mentioned before.

217
00:13:23,113 --> 00:13:27,515
They are inspired by real world holidays, but given our own fall in London spin.

218
00:13:29,036 --> 00:13:33,619
For example, in December we have an advent calendar and some content revolving around Mr.

219
00:13:33,859 --> 00:13:36,920
Saxe, who is an eldritch approximation of Santa Claus.

220
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:42,964
Mr. Saxe visits every day of the 12 days of Christmas, demanding different presents from the player.

221
00:13:43,884 --> 00:13:46,305
He's both exceedingly popular and fun to write.

222
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:50,508
It's also vital to use a number of freelancers.

223
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:56,043
we have benefited from seeking out those with different backgrounds and experiences to the in-house team.

224
00:13:57,204 --> 00:14:02,910
By doing so, we can not only appeal to a range of audiences and players who might not otherwise be interested in our work,

225
00:14:03,451 --> 00:14:05,913
but we regularly re-inspire the in-house content team.

226
00:14:07,415 --> 00:14:13,581
Freelance stories refresh and enrich our law and world in a way that has benefits far beyond the writer's individual story.

227
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:20,082
If the Failbetter team had to write for 10 years on the same game, without the creative refreshment

228
00:14:20,142 --> 00:14:25,125
diverse freelancers bring, it would be extremely difficult to maintain the excitement, mystery and

229
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:33,009
joy we try to pass on to our players. The next challenge is that of converting players to the

230
00:14:33,049 --> 00:14:38,793
subscription. You need an enticing free game to whet players' appetites for the stories only

231
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:39,953
available via subscription.

232
00:14:41,402 --> 00:14:46,524
The free game gives players stories that suggest mysteries, that get them invested in particular characters,

233
00:14:46,924 --> 00:14:52,365
such as the captivating princess here, who is Queen Victoria's most unsettling daughter.

234
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,226
Or there are groups you can get involved with, such as the revolutionaries,

235
00:14:56,306 --> 00:15:00,127
who seek to turn out the stars and plunge the world into eternal night.

236
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:02,128
As you do.

237
00:15:03,548 --> 00:15:08,550
Subscription stories offer deeper insight into lore, or more time with popular characters or groups.

238
00:15:09,374 --> 00:15:15,237
They also offer a space for a bingeable storyline. They are never driven by randomized cards and so

239
00:15:15,257 --> 00:15:21,221
can be explored and completed in one long play session. And because all our stories involve

240
00:15:21,261 --> 00:15:25,444
choices, there are many routes through the narratives, often with significantly different

241
00:15:25,484 --> 00:15:30,627
consequences. Players gather to talk about the options, discover what they had to leave unseen,

242
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:35,050
and in doing so spread the excitement to non-subscribers who can be lured in.

243
00:15:36,873 --> 00:15:39,174
Our narratives tempt players to buy stories.

244
00:15:39,934 --> 00:15:41,675
But it is the trust we've built with them

245
00:15:41,735 --> 00:15:43,715
that makes many willing to commit to subscriptions

246
00:15:43,935 --> 00:15:45,476
rather than one-off story purchases.

247
00:15:47,776 --> 00:15:49,737
We earned the players' trust in several ways.

248
00:15:50,937 --> 00:15:54,238
Narratively, we like to leave law-based mysteries and puzzles in the game.

249
00:15:55,058 --> 00:15:58,219
But we reveal enough that the players know that there are answers

250
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:00,799
and that we aren't just hand-waving something complex away.

251
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:05,420
And we do write stories that eventually confirm or disprove their hypotheses.

252
00:16:06,357 --> 00:16:09,299
They know that when it comes to our writing, we'll play fair.

253
00:16:11,741 --> 00:16:15,804
Subscribers are aware of the type of narrative we write, the shape of the story they will experience.

254
00:16:16,584 --> 00:16:20,027
So even if a subscriber prefers one month's subscriber story to another,

255
00:16:20,607 --> 00:16:24,830
they do not receive an unpleasant surprise that could drive them to go through the unsubscription process.

256
00:16:26,911 --> 00:16:31,154
We also have a fairly unusual audience, one that rejects the gacha gambling mechanics

257
00:16:31,174 --> 00:16:34,416
you sometimes see in free-to-play, and so we just don't use them.

258
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:37,262
The vast majority of Forn London is free.

259
00:16:37,642 --> 00:16:39,724
It's possible to have a good narrative experience

260
00:16:39,784 --> 00:16:41,045
without ever buying fate.

261
00:16:41,885 --> 00:16:44,027
We never fate lock mechanically optimal choices

262
00:16:44,187 --> 00:16:46,748
or force a player to pay fate to avoid permanent failure.

263
00:16:47,869 --> 00:16:50,310
Our audience seems to appreciate this general approach

264
00:16:51,091 --> 00:16:53,352
and as a result, are generous and supportive.

265
00:16:55,494 --> 00:16:58,135
Where possible, we make the player's choices meaningful ones.

266
00:16:59,256 --> 00:17:02,098
This means that as well as them having emotional significance

267
00:17:02,138 --> 00:17:03,018
at the point of making.

268
00:17:03,483 --> 00:17:05,165
they can resonate beyond the story itself.

269
00:17:06,105 --> 00:17:07,567
Decisions have permanence.

270
00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:10,669
The time and energy the player invests

271
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:12,751
in making those choices does not dissipate

272
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:13,611
the moment they move on.

273
00:17:14,232 --> 00:17:16,553
We respect their investment and try to recognize it.

274
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,677
If the players trust your intentions and design

275
00:17:21,918 --> 00:17:23,379
and appreciate the writing you're selling,

276
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:25,360
they will buy a narrative subscription.

277
00:17:28,783 --> 00:17:31,825
The final challenge, gaining and maintaining fans.

278
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:41,027
However good your writing is, you have to look after the technical side of the game.

279
00:17:42,447 --> 00:17:46,508
Fallen London has been around for 10 years and websites have not always been pretty.

280
00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:51,370
We recently revamped the site and added a significant number of quality of life improvements.

281
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:55,851
We also optimized it for mobile so that the players have more opportunities to play and

282
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:57,191
a more streamlined experience.

283
00:17:57,931 --> 00:18:00,592
This is on top of day-to-day maintenance and performance upgrades.

284
00:18:01,701 --> 00:18:04,723
It's important to tell the players that we're still there, listening to them,

285
00:18:05,103 --> 00:18:07,844
10 years later and even when simultaneously working on other games.

286
00:18:11,787 --> 00:18:15,228
In a role-playing game, you want to leave as much space for role-playing as possible.

287
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:20,171
We start from the very moment of character creation, when we offer the player character

288
00:18:20,211 --> 00:18:25,814
a gender choice or to opt out of it entirely. But the opt-out fits the setting, they aren't

289
00:18:25,894 --> 00:18:30,897
forced out of genre to take it. Our design factors in role-play.

290
00:18:31,901 --> 00:18:36,422
If there is a repeatable piece of content for pacing, it will make narrative and role-playing sense to repeat it.

291
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,844
We try not to assume why the player made the narrative choice that they did,

292
00:18:42,785 --> 00:18:45,125
and we avoid suggesting the player character's emotions.

293
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:52,588
If one player wants to swoon at the scene of a crime and another gloat in the gory details of it, that's absolutely fine.

294
00:18:53,288 --> 00:18:56,309
We'll lay out the scene of the crime and let them do the rest of the work.

295
00:18:58,293 --> 00:19:02,576
So, in our design and in our writing, we strive to leave space for the player imagination.

296
00:19:05,898 --> 00:19:10,841
We do the same with our lore. We build deep layers of lore into the game, revealing only

297
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:16,325
hints at a time. Of those mysteries fully resolved in game, a large number can only

298
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:21,468
be fully understood when players have seen all of several pieces of content. Because of the size of

299
00:19:21,488 --> 00:19:25,871
the game and the many alternate choices, this encourages players to share things that they've

300
00:19:25,911 --> 00:19:27,191
learned in debate hypotheses.

301
00:19:28,078 --> 00:19:32,320
Not only does this drive gameplay and maintain engagement, but the discussions can draw in

302
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,881
less dedicated players or even those who haven't yet played.

303
00:19:34,901 --> 00:19:39,123
I've been looking forward to this slide.

304
00:19:40,044 --> 00:19:42,625
Our content creation can be very responsive.

305
00:19:43,846 --> 00:19:47,548
This gives us the opportunity to react in game to fan discussions outside the game.

306
00:19:47,948 --> 00:19:51,430
It's how we acquired a vignette about buying excessive numbers of weasels.

307
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:57,673
Is accidentally purchasing 500 weasels an appropriate reason to contact Failbetter Support?

308
00:19:59,358 --> 00:20:03,181
Chris Gardner, our narrative director, just happened to be browsing Reddit at the time

309
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:08,385
it was posted. In a bout of whimsy, he created a small amount of new content in response.

310
00:20:09,146 --> 00:20:14,730
The rest of the thread was delighted. And it's a good example of what we do to keep

311
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:21,395
our fans engaged. It made the players feel heard. It fostered community. It demonstrates

312
00:20:21,435 --> 00:20:26,359
how the content team can be responsive. And it makes the content team gleeful because

313
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:28,381
this is just really enjoyable content to write.

314
00:20:32,534 --> 00:20:37,397
We put a great deal of effort into communicating clearly and directly with our fans. Any fan

315
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:42,240
who reaches out to us with something constructive gets a personal response. And feedback is

316
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:47,844
always passed on to the relevant teams. The devs themselves post in the forums. We lay

317
00:20:47,904 --> 00:20:52,907
out business reasoning for decisions as clearly as we can. We trust our players to be understanding

318
00:20:53,207 --> 00:20:59,411
and they seem to appreciate that trust and respond to it in a really positive way. We

319
00:20:59,451 --> 00:21:01,293
take a similar approach when handling support.

320
00:21:02,087 --> 00:21:06,752
Support is not hived off to a separate part of the business. Tickets are passed directly to the dev,

321
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:10,736
best placed to fix the cause of the problem. There is a direct contact between the player

322
00:21:10,976 --> 00:21:16,341
with an issue and the person best able to fix it. Not only does this result in a high satisfaction,

323
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:21,266
but it gives the players a chance to see a little of the people behind the game. To see that we're

324
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:26,471
mostly human, however horrific. And it provides an opportunity for a developer whimsy.

325
00:21:28,525 --> 00:21:33,588
This is an interaction between a player trying to acquire a lost Kickstarter Steam key and Les,

326
00:21:33,648 --> 00:21:38,470
our senior QA specialist who's in the audience over there. It might have taken her a little

327
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:43,192
longer to respond in kind, but it was a really nice recognition of the player's original effort.

328
00:21:43,633 --> 00:21:47,254
And sometimes doing this kind of thing can diffuse negative player experiences,

329
00:21:47,314 --> 00:21:51,597
so if they're quite angry and you respond in a way that shows you're a person,

330
00:21:52,017 --> 00:21:56,439
it often makes things better and get a lot of praise from people originally being quite rude.

331
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:57,740
So...

332
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:04,734
It all works. Our fans are absolutely engaged. And these are just a few examples of responses

333
00:22:04,774 --> 00:22:09,598
to a fan competition we ran. I'm always impressed by what they do out of love for our work.

334
00:22:10,118 --> 00:22:14,582
And I would totally wear that dress. It's decorated with the correspondence, which is

335
00:22:14,622 --> 00:22:19,025
the in-law language of the stars, and it tends to have a conflagratory effect on the reader.

336
00:22:19,165 --> 00:22:26,111
So that's a dress with built-in self-defense. So what should you take away from this?

337
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:31,984
By adding a narrative-based monthly subscription to Fallen London, we made a reliable income stream

338
00:22:32,044 --> 00:22:37,268
that supports all the work of Fail Better Games. The benefits of having a game like Fallen London

339
00:22:37,308 --> 00:22:42,832
extend further than just its own success. It supports the company so that any premium products

340
00:22:42,852 --> 00:22:48,536
we make are de-risked. We do not have to rely on them being a wild success. It serves as a

341
00:22:48,556 --> 00:22:52,960
narrative testbed. We can use subscription feedback to discover what kinds of stories

342
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,262
players wish to explore in Fallen London and our other games.

343
00:22:57,804 --> 00:23:00,446
It provides us with a universe in which to base our other games.

344
00:23:00,686 --> 00:23:02,327
It inspires our premium products.

345
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:05,470
And it has led to our Kickstarter success.

346
00:23:06,431 --> 00:23:08,793
Fallen London fans contributed to our Kickstarter

347
00:23:08,953 --> 00:23:10,415
and to the publicity surrounding it.

348
00:23:11,195 --> 00:23:11,916
This meant that in 2017,

349
00:23:11,976 --> 00:23:15,579
the Sun in the Sky's Kickstarter had over 10,000 backers,

350
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,101
was fully funded on Kickstarter in four hours,

351
00:23:18,342 --> 00:23:20,463
and reached 377% funding.

352
00:23:21,364 --> 00:23:24,046
It was the third most funded video game Kickstarter that year.

353
00:23:28,169 --> 00:23:31,231
There definitely is real value in subscription offerings

354
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:32,211
in free-to-play games.

355
00:23:32,972 --> 00:23:35,373
To make it work, you need to figure out what works for you.

356
00:23:35,893 --> 00:23:38,455
But if you're working with narratives,

357
00:23:39,055 --> 00:23:40,676
build an iterative loop for the content.

358
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,957
In our case, the subscription stories

359
00:23:42,977 --> 00:23:44,878
and after-the-fact engagement with the audience

360
00:23:44,998 --> 00:23:46,819
enables us to gauge the story's success

361
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:48,780
and informs the content roadmap.

362
00:23:50,461 --> 00:23:53,463
You need good, free content to establish a reputation

363
00:23:53,943 --> 00:23:55,544
and support the subscription package.

364
00:23:56,262 --> 00:24:00,404
Free players still have a great deal of value, especially if you also produce other games.

365
00:24:01,865 --> 00:24:05,888
But your best stuff should be for money. There needs to be a reason to subscribe, after all.

366
00:24:07,149 --> 00:24:12,232
And finally, respect your audience. If you design and write appreciating the investment

367
00:24:12,272 --> 00:24:17,216
players make in your products, they'll be able to tell. Player trust is vital to long-term success.

368
00:24:19,526 --> 00:24:22,508
So before I end, I just wanted to let you know that Failbetter is currently hiring.

369
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:26,111
We're looking for a senior gameplay programmer which can be fully remote,

370
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:31,114
which is fairly rare, so go for it. And we also need a producer. The producer will need to come

371
00:24:31,174 --> 00:24:34,857
to the London office at least two days a week, so you'll probably have to be in the UK.

372
00:24:35,478 --> 00:24:39,220
But if you're interested, please go to our website. Thank you.
