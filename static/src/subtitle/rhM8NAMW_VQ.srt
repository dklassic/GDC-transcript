1
00:00:04,777 --> 00:00:10,582
Good afternoon. Wow. I'm Steve Golson and you're all here to

2
00:00:10,582 --> 00:00:14,425
hear about Ms. Pac-Man. And here in the 21st century, they tell

3
00:00:14,425 --> 00:00:19,229
me we have to turn off our phones. So we'll see. How does

4
00:00:19,229 --> 00:00:25,715
that work again? So turn off your phone, please. And make it

5
00:00:25,715 --> 00:00:27,257
quiet. That's good.

6
00:00:30,032 --> 00:00:30,793
Let's get started.

7
00:00:30,793 --> 00:00:32,353
Thank you for being here.

8
00:00:32,353 --> 00:00:33,694
So who am I?

9
00:00:33,694 --> 00:00:34,535
So I'm Steve Golson.

10
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,336
And a very long time ago, I did game design.

11
00:00:37,336 --> 00:00:40,898
And so I'm here to give you whatever pearls of wisdom you

12
00:00:40,898 --> 00:00:42,639
might deign to take.

13
00:00:42,639 --> 00:00:43,700
Who are you?

14
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,820
So let's ask questions.

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,882
So who has played Ms. Pac-Man on an actual arcade machine?

16
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,303
Oh, awesome.

17
00:00:50,303 --> 00:00:50,763
OK.

18
00:00:50,763 --> 00:00:50,864
OK.

19
00:00:50,864 --> 00:00:53,185
Who's played it in an actual arcade?

20
00:00:53,185 --> 00:00:54,806
This is awesome.

21
00:00:54,806 --> 00:00:55,246
All right.

22
00:00:55,246 --> 00:00:55,626
All right.

23
00:00:55,626 --> 00:00:56,186
All right.

24
00:01:01,012 --> 00:01:05,296
Who remembers playing it when it first came out? Okay, we're

25
00:01:05,296 --> 00:01:11,021
all over 50. Am I right? And then lastly, do we have any

26
00:01:11,021 --> 00:01:13,984
hardware people in the room? Hardware designers? Yeah, not

27
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:16,847
so many. Long ago it would have been a lot of you, but that's

28
00:01:16,847 --> 00:01:21,091
okay. So talk about hardware. You software people, just nod

29
00:01:21,091 --> 00:01:22,352
your heads. Okay.

30
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:25,583
All right.

31
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:26,704
So what was General Computer?

32
00:01:26,704 --> 00:01:29,885
General Computer was a company 35 years ago,

33
00:01:29,885 --> 00:01:32,866
and I'll talk a little bit about how it came to be.

34
00:01:32,866 --> 00:01:35,267
We did a tremendous amount of game design work

35
00:01:35,267 --> 00:01:38,188
in the early 80s.

36
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:38,788
And this is.

37
00:01:38,908 --> 00:01:44,973
1981 through 1984 or so. And why it matters is because games

38
00:01:44,973 --> 00:01:47,975
are just insanely amounts of fun. And it was fun designing

39
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:50,517
them back then and it's fun doing it today. So I'm just

40
00:01:50,517 --> 00:01:53,579
going to try to give you a little bit of a flavor of what

41
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:57,141
it was and talk specifically about Ms. Pac-Man. But to talk

42
00:01:57,141 --> 00:02:01,524
about Ms. Pac-Man, I have to give you a little more history.

43
00:02:01,524 --> 00:02:05,707
So this all goes back to MIT. Any MIT people here?

44
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,203
Yeah, okay. In 1978, and there were two students in this

45
00:02:12,203 --> 00:02:14,884
dormitory where I lived, Doug McCray and Kevin Curran. And

46
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:18,786
they started up a partnership, the two of them, to do pinball

47
00:02:18,786 --> 00:02:22,528
games and video games in our dormitory. Long story about how

48
00:02:22,528 --> 00:02:25,669
that came about. But the two of them formed this partnership,

49
00:02:25,669 --> 00:02:28,051
and, hey, we're going to run pinball games and run them.

50
00:02:28,971 --> 00:02:33,513
They eventually spread out into three different dorms and had

51
00:02:33,513 --> 00:02:36,995
like over 20 machines. It was very successful running games

52
00:02:36,995 --> 00:02:40,336
because you had this captive audience of MIT students who

53
00:02:40,336 --> 00:02:42,998
this was one of the few ways you could relax was to go and play

54
00:02:42,998 --> 00:02:48,080
video games and pinball games. So they came up to speed on how

55
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,121
do you maintain these games and how do you keep them operating

56
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:52,762
and how do you make money at it?

57
00:02:54,067 --> 00:02:58,105
One of the things that was common back then were what were

58
00:02:58,105 --> 00:02:59,110
called speed-up kits.

59
00:02:59,706 --> 00:03:02,028
And the philosophy behind a speed-up kit is, well, you

60
00:03:02,028 --> 00:03:05,091
need to understand the dynamics of the arcade

61
00:03:05,091 --> 00:03:09,935
industry, is that you'd bring out a new game, and it costs $2,000, $2,500.

62
00:03:09,935 --> 00:03:12,237
You'd put it in your arcade or put it out on play.

63
00:03:12,237 --> 00:03:15,580
And you'd get great revenues for a while.

64
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:20,024
And then the revenues would drop off.

65
00:03:20,024 --> 00:03:22,906
Your coin drop would reduce, as we say.

66
00:03:22,906 --> 00:03:24,248
And what's wrong?

67
00:03:24,248 --> 00:03:26,990
Well, the players have gotten really good at the game.

68
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:30,670
They figured out how to beat the game and they would play for

69
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,292
longer and longer and longer. But there's nothing physically

70
00:03:34,292 --> 00:03:37,774
wrong with the machine. The display is fine. The controls

71
00:03:37,774 --> 00:03:41,516
are fine. The cabinet is fine. They're learning how to beat the

72
00:03:41,516 --> 00:03:41,776
software.

73
00:03:43,247 --> 00:03:45,847
So these kits started being created and sold.

74
00:03:45,847 --> 00:03:48,008
And they were initially called speed-up kits.

75
00:03:48,008 --> 00:03:50,329
And the reason they were called speed-up kits was because,

76
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:52,529
really, the first one came for asteroids.

77
00:03:52,529 --> 00:03:54,250
Very popular game from Atari in 1979.

78
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,710
Who's played Asteroids?

79
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,131
An actual Asteroids machine.

80
00:03:58,131 --> 00:04:00,491
It's vector driven.

81
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:01,592
Oh, want to have a good time?

82
00:04:01,592 --> 00:04:03,752
Go behind the back of the Asteroids machine and crank up

83
00:04:03,752 --> 00:04:05,153
the brightness.

84
00:04:05,153 --> 00:04:06,293
Anyone ever done that?

85
00:04:06,293 --> 00:04:07,633
Because then you can watch.

86
00:04:08,195 --> 00:04:11,977
how it draws the characters on the screen. It's very cool to

87
00:04:11,977 --> 00:04:16,719
see. The way asteroids works is it's interrupt driven. Every

88
00:04:16,719 --> 00:04:20,700
four milliseconds the processor gets interrupted. It wakes up,

89
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:26,583
scans the controls, draws the screen, goes back to sleep. And

90
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:31,065
it waits for the next interrupt. So some smart hardware guy said

91
00:04:31,065 --> 00:04:36,247
all I have to do is speed up that tick and the game will run

92
00:04:36,247 --> 00:04:36,707
faster.

93
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:41,993
hints speed up kit. Now, everybody likes this. The game

94
00:04:41,993 --> 00:04:44,535
owner likes it because he's making more money. The players

95
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:47,598
actually like it because they have more of a challenge. Here's

96
00:04:47,598 --> 00:04:51,601
an asteroid speed up kit. This is actually on my asteroids that

97
00:04:51,601 --> 00:04:54,844
I have in my basement. Now, notice this is a complete

98
00:04:54,844 --> 00:04:59,647
hardware modification. There's no software has been harmed in

99
00:04:59,647 --> 00:05:04,151
the making of this speed up kit. All hardware. Which the arcade

100
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:05,953
owners understood. They understood hardware.

101
00:05:07,143 --> 00:05:08,443
Okay, what's the next game?

102
00:05:08,443 --> 00:05:10,464
Galaxian, very popular game.

103
00:05:10,464 --> 00:05:13,245
Now, Galaxian speed-up kit, or modification kit,

104
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:17,147
you actually modify the software,

105
00:05:17,147 --> 00:05:19,008
but you didn't have to understand very much.

106
00:05:19,008 --> 00:05:20,849
It's a table-driven game.

107
00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:23,310
So if you found the tables in ROM,

108
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,471
if you found the single byte that controlled

109
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:30,052
how many attacking characters there are on the first wave,

110
00:05:30,052 --> 00:05:33,734
and you changed that table, well, you modified the game.

111
00:05:34,014 --> 00:05:38,458
and it got harder, it got better, and so these super

112
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:41,580
Galaxian kits came about. Oh, and be sure and change the

113
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,242
prompt so it doesn't say Galaxian anymore. It says some

114
00:05:44,242 --> 00:05:48,025
other name you've come up with. So this would be sold as a

115
00:05:48,025 --> 00:05:51,929
complete new ROM set for the game, even though you've only

116
00:05:51,929 --> 00:05:55,832
changed a few percent of the code, maybe 10%. The only way

117
00:05:55,832 --> 00:06:01,076
you could provide this to the end user is by selling them a

118
00:06:01,076 --> 00:06:02,337
complete new set of ROMs.

119
00:06:03,412 --> 00:06:05,012
Can anyone tell me why that's a problem?

120
00:06:05,012 --> 00:06:06,833
Well, it's a problem because of copyright,

121
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,954
because you're copying most of the codes.

122
00:06:08,954 --> 00:06:09,714
That's one problem.

123
00:06:09,714 --> 00:06:13,195
Number two is you're selling them a lot of expensive ROMs

124
00:06:13,195 --> 00:06:16,096
when you only need to sell them a few.

125
00:06:16,096 --> 00:06:18,057
And number three, and the biggest problem,

126
00:06:18,057 --> 00:06:20,258
is anybody who knows how to copy a ROM

127
00:06:20,258 --> 00:06:21,518
can now copy your kit.

128
00:06:21,518 --> 00:06:24,059
That's the worst problem of all.

129
00:06:24,059 --> 00:06:26,680
So what are we gonna do?

130
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,361
Oh, Pac-Man, Pac-Man very similar to Galaxian.

131
00:06:30,292 --> 00:06:32,654
The maze is a table in ROM.

132
00:06:32,654 --> 00:06:36,235
And so if you go in and change the characters of the table,

133
00:06:36,235 --> 00:06:38,297
you can change the maze.

134
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,678
And also the graphics ROMs are separate little ROMs.

135
00:06:40,678 --> 00:06:42,479
If you go in and change them, you change the

136
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,700
characters of the game.

137
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:48,242
And there were a number of kits for Pac-Man that put in

138
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:52,464
new mazes and put in new characters.

139
00:06:52,464 --> 00:06:53,305
And so, ooh, cool game.

140
00:06:53,305 --> 00:06:54,165
Everything else stayed the same.

141
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:54,966
Missile Command.

142
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:59,908
Missile Command was really popular at MIT.

143
00:07:00,972 --> 00:07:05,355
nuclear war, explosions, it was pretty cool. And Doug and Kevin

144
00:07:05,355 --> 00:07:10,079
had three missile command games. I mean, they're like sophomores.

145
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:16,303
This is early in their career. But missile command, and the

146
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:19,785
same phenomenon happened with missile command was lots of

147
00:07:19,785 --> 00:07:22,647
revenue and then boom, the revenue drops off as the players

148
00:07:22,647 --> 00:07:26,810
got good at it. So Doug and Kevin start looking around,

149
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,472
who's got a speed up kit? Who's got an enhancement kit for

150
00:07:29,472 --> 00:07:30,053
missile command?

151
00:07:30,668 --> 00:07:34,191
nobody. Well, it was a very sophisticated game. It was bit

152
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:39,595
map. There were no characters in ROM because everything is drawn

153
00:07:39,595 --> 00:07:46,321
one pixel at a time. So they're annoyed. Oh, geez, what are we

154
00:07:46,321 --> 00:07:52,726
going to do? We can't find a kit. And then suddenly they

155
00:07:52,726 --> 00:07:56,910
realized, hey, we go to MIT. I bet we could write a kit. So

156
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,812
general computer started up during spring break.

157
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:04,933
1981, much more fun writing game software than going to the

158
00:08:04,933 --> 00:08:09,376
beach. And we couldn't come up with the name, general

159
00:08:09,376 --> 00:08:12,678
computer. We couldn't think of a better name. It seemed generic

160
00:08:12,678 --> 00:08:18,061
enough and it sounded really large. General motors, general

161
00:08:18,061 --> 00:08:22,043
electric, general foods, general computer. Hey, sure. So that's

162
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:26,206
the name and it stuck. So we started working on

163
00:08:26,946 --> 00:08:29,229
what we called super missile attack as an enhancement kit.

164
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:31,832
And so there was a handful of us who were living in a townhouse

165
00:08:31,832 --> 00:08:36,799
outside in Brookline, across from MIT, all students, and

166
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,404
started in, as I said, spring break of 1981, mid-March.

167
00:08:40,404 --> 00:08:43,107
We're lucky to have any photos at all.

168
00:08:45,327 --> 00:08:51,270
So I'm Chris road who is this, will be annoyed when he sees

169
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,871
this, but that's okay. So you can see a missile command

170
00:08:53,871 --> 00:08:57,893
cabinet. You can see Chris playing. And then to the left

171
00:08:57,893 --> 00:09:01,494
there, you see this sort of beige thing with a screen.

172
00:09:01,494 --> 00:09:05,616
That's a gen rad microprocessor emulator. Costs about $25,000.

173
00:09:05,616 --> 00:09:13,220
And that's what we used to do our development of super missile

174
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:13,520
attack.

175
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:17,604
talk a little more about that. Here's another photo. In the

176
00:09:17,604 --> 00:09:23,190
back there you can see the TRS-80 that we used to capture

177
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,153
the software. That's Kevin Kern on the left and that's Doug

178
00:09:26,153 --> 00:09:29,736
McCray taking a nap because we were getting about four hours of

179
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:33,360
sleep a night. You can also see the daisy wheel printer. Do you

180
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,641
know what a daisy wheel printer is?

181
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:39,923
So how did this work? So we had a microprocessor emulator that

182
00:09:39,923 --> 00:09:45,187
could disassemble the code. Because basically this is a

183
00:09:45,187 --> 00:09:48,170
reverse engineering problem. We have to understand how missile

184
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:54,114
command works so that we can modify what we need to change.

185
00:09:55,756 --> 00:09:58,099
And unfortunately, the disassembly only would

186
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:00,001
disassemble on the screen.

187
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:02,804
And you'd get like 30 lines of code disassembled.

188
00:10:02,804 --> 00:10:04,485
So how are we going to capture it?

189
00:10:04,485 --> 00:10:08,890
Well, you would sit next to the GENRAD with the TRS-80 and

190
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:11,453
type it in by hand what you saw on the screen.

191
00:10:11,453 --> 00:10:11,713
Workflow.

192
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:17,889
You think your work flow is bad? Dude. So here's one of the

193
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:23,592
sheets that we captured. And kind of hard to see, but down

194
00:10:23,592 --> 00:10:26,433
at the bottom, this is page 55. I mean, this is like this

195
00:10:26,433 --> 00:10:29,655
enormous huge thick thing that we typed in by hand. But it

196
00:10:29,655 --> 00:10:32,957
helped you understand the game. And then lots of handwritten

197
00:10:32,957 --> 00:10:35,218
scrolls on there about, oh, here's what's going on here,

198
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,338
here's what's going on there.

199
00:10:37,157 --> 00:10:39,879
We figured out how the game worked, how missile command worked.

200
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:42,962
Figured out what the different ROM locations were, memory locations.

201
00:10:42,962 --> 00:10:47,687
And then as we're doing our own development,

202
00:10:47,687 --> 00:10:49,269
how did you do your character development?

203
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:51,250
Well, you got out a big piece of graph paper

204
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,212
and you started putting little X's and O's on it.

205
00:10:53,212 --> 00:10:55,475
So what's my new character going to look like?

206
00:10:57,069 --> 00:11:00,191
So bear with me. We'll get to Ms. Pac-Man eventually, but you

207
00:11:00,191 --> 00:11:03,893
need to understand that. So intellectual property. So we

208
00:11:03,893 --> 00:11:07,455
were thinking about intellectual property, how to protect our

209
00:11:07,455 --> 00:11:10,997
own and how to not infringe others. So we wanted to avoid

210
00:11:10,997 --> 00:11:14,759
copyright infringement like the people doing the Galaxians kit

211
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:18,561
would do. Trademark infringement, so we did not call

212
00:11:18,561 --> 00:11:21,482
it missile command. We called it super missile attack.

213
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:27,758
and we did not want somebody else ripping off what we were making

214
00:11:27,758 --> 00:11:31,542
so we made some clever hardware in there to make it difficult to copy

215
00:11:31,542 --> 00:11:37,648
this is the hardware, I did the hardware design for this, this is our little board

216
00:11:37,648 --> 00:11:42,232
and it would go, this is from the manual for Super Missile Attack

217
00:11:42,232 --> 00:11:44,615
so it plugs inside the missile command cabinet

218
00:11:45,677 --> 00:11:49,458
So you'd sell this board to the arcade operator and there you

219
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:55,039
would go. So there's 12K bytes. You know, I was at that talk

220
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:57,620
this morning, the 30-year anniversary, and they were

221
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:02,161
making a big deal about hard disks. Hard disks? We didn't

222
00:12:02,161 --> 00:12:06,742
have any hard disks. You know, 12K bytes. Wow, that was a big

223
00:12:06,742 --> 00:12:10,523
game. So anyhow. So missile command is 12K bytes. That's

224
00:12:10,523 --> 00:12:13,283
what goes in those six empty sockets.

225
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:17,229
and then our 4k bytes of code,

226
00:12:17,229 --> 00:12:19,450
and then some magic circuitry in the middle.

227
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:24,153
One of those chips is what was called a PAL chip,

228
00:12:24,153 --> 00:12:26,215
programmable logic, so you could customize it

229
00:12:26,215 --> 00:12:29,397
and you could blow the last fuse in such a way

230
00:12:29,397 --> 00:12:30,978
that someone could not copy it.

231
00:12:30,978 --> 00:12:32,779
And so that was key to our anti-copying.

232
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:34,800
People would not be able to,

233
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,642
you would have to be very sophisticated in order to do it,

234
00:12:37,642 --> 00:12:41,525
and that's who we were trying to deter.

235
00:12:42,357 --> 00:12:45,759
to even make that even more hard, we said,

236
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:47,840
oh, we're gonna strip the markings off the PAL chip

237
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,422
so people will not even know it's a PAL.

238
00:12:50,422 --> 00:12:52,664
And we wanted to make the markings GCC

239
00:12:52,664 --> 00:12:54,465
because that was our company name,

240
00:12:54,465 --> 00:12:57,347
but the marking company didn't quite get it right

241
00:12:57,347 --> 00:12:58,468
and so they made it CG.

242
00:12:58,468 --> 00:13:01,550
Oh well, this is important later.

243
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,291
So, anyway.

244
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:03,731
Hey, that's me.

245
00:13:05,205 --> 00:13:09,947
back when I had lots of hair, sitting at the TRS-80 and

246
00:13:09,947 --> 00:13:14,529
programming pals. What's really interesting about this is what

247
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:18,131
was captured on the white board in the back. So there's a bunch

248
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:23,273
of notes there, but you can see our schedule. So May 11th,

249
00:13:23,273 --> 00:13:25,834
replay and play meter, those were the two big industry

250
00:13:25,834 --> 00:13:30,096
magazines where our ad was going to run. So obviously on May 12th

251
00:13:30,096 --> 00:13:32,117
we're going to start getting phone calls for orders.

252
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:36,957
And our software freeze is not for a week later.

253
00:13:36,957 --> 00:13:40,498
That's not the way it happens now, is it?

254
00:13:40,498 --> 00:13:40,598
No.

255
00:13:40,598 --> 00:13:40,858
No, no, no.

256
00:13:40,858 --> 00:13:42,419
You're all done well before you start

257
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:43,879
marketing your product.

258
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:44,600
Anyway.

259
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,420
And in fact, that's exactly what happened.

260
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,881
Here's our ad.

261
00:13:49,881 --> 00:13:55,043
And it was a four-color, full-page ad inside front

262
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,324
cover, not one of those little black and white classified ads

263
00:13:57,324 --> 00:13:57,944
like the other ones.

264
00:13:57,944 --> 00:13:58,484
It's like, oh no.

265
00:13:59,118 --> 00:14:01,299
We're going full bore for marketing.

266
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:02,199
We had an 800 number.

267
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:03,440
It was great.

268
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,002
And we sold about 1,000 units in two months.

269
00:14:07,002 --> 00:14:08,042
So netted $1.25 million.

270
00:14:08,042 --> 00:14:11,704
That's pretty good for a bunch of MIT dropouts, which we had

271
00:14:11,704 --> 00:14:14,606
all dropped out by then.

272
00:14:14,606 --> 00:14:18,448
Much to our parents' chagrin, it's like, hey, dude, I'm

273
00:14:18,448 --> 00:14:19,008
designing games.

274
00:14:19,008 --> 00:14:19,989
This is so much fun.

275
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,701
So who did that?

276
00:14:23,701 --> 00:14:26,503
So there were six of us who worked on that

277
00:14:26,503 --> 00:14:29,485
and designed Super Missile Attack.

278
00:14:29,485 --> 00:14:30,886
And boom, off we go.

279
00:14:30,886 --> 00:14:32,227
And this is just awesome.

280
00:14:32,227 --> 00:14:34,509
I mean, the arcade owners love this.

281
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:35,670
The players loved it.

282
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,431
We got calls from arcade owners just like,

283
00:14:37,431 --> 00:14:39,092
players are coming in and saying,

284
00:14:39,092 --> 00:14:40,373
do you have Super Missile Attack?

285
00:14:40,373 --> 00:14:42,615
And they're leaving when I don't have it.

286
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:43,916
So send me one of your kits.

287
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:44,877
Awesome.

288
00:14:44,877 --> 00:14:46,618
So a lot of word of mouth.

289
00:14:51,652 --> 00:14:57,957
So Atari didn't take kindly to this. They sued us for $15

290
00:14:57,957 --> 00:15:05,803
million. The complaints were copyright infringement, false

291
00:15:05,803 --> 00:15:08,905
designation of origin, trademark infringement, unfair competition.

292
00:15:08,905 --> 00:15:14,589
That's my favorite. Because Atari's gross income the year

293
00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:16,431
before was $415 million.

294
00:15:17,714 --> 00:15:20,575
and they're going after a handful of dropouts. It's like,

295
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,637
hey, you're not scaring us. We've got nothing for you. And

296
00:15:23,637 --> 00:15:27,679
Atari back then, it's hard to imagine, but today Atari was the

297
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:32,681
high-tech company. If you were today to take Google plus Apple

298
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:39,064
plus Microsoft plus Sony plus half the companies on the floor

299
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:41,746
and put them all in one and that was Atari. They were just

300
00:15:41,746 --> 00:15:42,886
high-flying, high-tech.

301
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:52,222
amazing. So they sued us and we go to court and we got a lot of

302
00:15:52,222 --> 00:15:56,624
press. So press coverage. Hey, no coverage is bad, right? So

303
00:15:57,596 --> 00:16:03,702
So we got press coverage from Boston Globe and the first few

304
00:16:03,702 --> 00:16:06,105
court appearances did not go well for us. We got a

305
00:16:06,105 --> 00:16:09,448
restraining order. This was our local hometown paper we had

306
00:16:09,448 --> 00:16:13,472
moved by now out into Wayland and there's a photo from the

307
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:17,757
paper. That's Doug McCray standing at our super missile

308
00:16:17,757 --> 00:16:21,240
attack that we had created for the court.

309
00:16:22,744 --> 00:16:26,127
This happened in late July through August.

310
00:16:26,127 --> 00:16:27,828
We're not backing down.

311
00:16:27,828 --> 00:16:32,172
We're deposing Ray Kassar at Atari and various engineers

312
00:16:32,172 --> 00:16:35,775
and Atari's like getting annoyed.

313
00:16:35,775 --> 00:16:39,678
So naturally, what do they do?

314
00:16:39,678 --> 00:16:40,199
They hire us.

315
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:43,922
And they're like, what do you guys want?

316
00:16:43,922 --> 00:16:45,663
We're gonna design games.

317
00:16:45,663 --> 00:16:47,225
Why don't you design games for Atari?

318
00:16:47,378 --> 00:16:49,560
why don't you drop your lawsuit?

319
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,781
So, that's in fact what happened.

320
00:16:51,781 --> 00:16:55,604
And they, so they dropped their lawsuit with prejudice,

321
00:16:55,604 --> 00:16:58,065
meaning they will never file it again.

322
00:16:58,065 --> 00:17:01,027
We will stop making Super Missile Attack.

323
00:17:01,027 --> 00:17:03,489
Yeah, sure, okay.

324
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:04,289
All right.

325
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:05,850
And they're gonna pay us $50,000 a month.

326
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:10,615
design games. We found out years later that they thought we were

327
00:17:10,615 --> 00:17:13,916
just going to take the money and run and go sit on a beach. No,

328
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:17,458
man, we're going to design games for you. So we did. And on that

329
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,779
third bullet point, that's the key one, we will not market

330
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:21,981
enhancement kits without permission from the

331
00:17:21,981 --> 00:17:24,982
manufacturer. This was the key thing that Atari wanted to

332
00:17:24,982 --> 00:17:30,405
avoid. If they had lost the suit and it was proven legal that

333
00:17:30,405 --> 00:17:33,867
games could be modified by the end user, that would set a very

334
00:17:33,867 --> 00:17:34,567
bad precedent.

335
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:40,229
The legal protection for games at this time was very unsettled.

336
00:17:40,229 --> 00:17:45,550
Was there copyright protection for games for the audio visual presentation?

337
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,731
It was not clear at all.

338
00:17:47,731 --> 00:17:50,672
And so they did not want a precedent being set.

339
00:17:50,672 --> 00:17:54,233
So make the lawsuit go away, hire us, we'll do games for them.

340
00:17:54,233 --> 00:17:58,494
Well meanwhile, all summer long we've been working on another kit.

341
00:17:59,603 --> 00:18:03,345
because we got done with super missile attack end of May, 1st

342
00:18:03,345 --> 00:18:06,687
of June. What are we going to do next? We're going to do another

343
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:10,609
kit. This one is working great. How do you decide what to build?

344
00:18:10,609 --> 00:18:14,631
What kind of a kit? So super missile attack, we're thinking

345
00:18:14,631 --> 00:18:18,072
maybe you get 3 to 5% of the installed base. So you want to

346
00:18:18,072 --> 00:18:20,714
look for a game that has a big installed base. You want to look

347
00:18:20,714 --> 00:18:22,454
for a game that is obvious what you can do.

348
00:18:23,612 --> 00:18:28,217
to change it. Or maybe you just wholesale put a complete new

349
00:18:28,217 --> 00:18:32,281
game in the existing cabinet. So we thought about this and we

350
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:34,944
had a couple of ideas. One was asteroids, huge build of

351
00:18:34,944 --> 00:18:36,286
asteroids, 70,000 of them out there.

352
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:41,527
But Pac-Man, Pac-Man was the hot new game in the U.S. in 1981.

353
00:18:41,527 --> 00:18:45,649
It was just peaking in popularity. And so we knew we

354
00:18:45,649 --> 00:18:47,771
were going to hit the market at the right time with our kit

355
00:18:47,771 --> 00:18:50,973
because it was obvious there were problems with Pac-Man. It

356
00:18:50,973 --> 00:18:56,416
was predictable play. In fact, there were these books, right?

357
00:18:56,416 --> 00:19:00,058
Mastering Pac-Man and the video master's guide to Pac-Man that

358
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:04,281
had all the patterns in them for how to beat the game.

359
00:19:05,003 --> 00:19:06,265
You could play Pac-Man forever.

360
00:19:06,265 --> 00:19:08,026
So we're like, oh, well, clearly we know how we're

361
00:19:08,026 --> 00:19:08,627
going to do this.

362
00:19:08,627 --> 00:19:11,329
We're going to kill the predictability.

363
00:19:11,329 --> 00:19:15,393
So we started working on this in early June, early mid-June 1981.

364
00:19:16,796 --> 00:19:20,457
First thing, that's from a Tektronix marketing, that's not

365
00:19:20,457 --> 00:19:21,897
us, but we needed this.

366
00:19:21,897 --> 00:19:25,438
This is a Genrad did not work with the Z80 processor, so we

367
00:19:25,438 --> 00:19:27,019
needed a different enhancement kit.

368
00:19:27,019 --> 00:19:29,199
Excuse me, a different emulator.

369
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:32,140
So we got a Tektronix 8550 Z80 emulator.

370
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,520
Uses eight inch floppy disks.

371
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,461
And oh, what we really loved was it supported a line

372
00:19:38,461 --> 00:19:41,802
printer, so we could do our disassembly and print it out

373
00:19:41,802 --> 00:19:42,442
on a line printer.

374
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:43,963
Who knows what a line printer is?

375
00:19:43,963 --> 00:19:44,383
Yeah, OK.

376
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:44,683
But.

377
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:55,059
eight inch floppies. And held a megabyte. Pretty awesome. So

378
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:57,700
how did we go about reverse engineering? Again, so here's

379
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,821
another game. We need to understand how pac-man works so

380
00:20:00,821 --> 00:20:02,001
that we can modify it.

381
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,741
So what are your sources for your reverse engineering?

382
00:20:05,741 --> 00:20:07,562
Well, we had the manuals.

383
00:20:07,562 --> 00:20:10,364
So there's a little bit that that tells you.

384
00:20:10,364 --> 00:20:14,046
Schematics, because these were sold to arcade owners who have

385
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,107
some knowledge to repair the game.

386
00:20:16,107 --> 00:20:18,248
So you could figure out the address map.

387
00:20:18,248 --> 00:20:20,650
You could figure out how the graphics hardware worked.

388
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,751
You could get a little bit of the game.

389
00:20:22,751 --> 00:20:25,172
Here's the basic Pac-Man hardware.

390
00:20:25,172 --> 00:20:25,572
16K of code.

391
00:20:25,572 --> 00:20:29,875
Separate graphics ROMs, 8K worth.

392
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:34,776
a fixed character playfield, and six moving characters,

393
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:36,237
what you would call today's sprites.

394
00:20:36,237 --> 00:20:37,437
We called them stamps back then,

395
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:39,977
because we didn't know any better.

396
00:20:39,977 --> 00:20:43,338
And you had four colors at a time.

397
00:20:43,338 --> 00:20:45,239
Actually, you only had three colors.

398
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:46,919
You had three colors and transparent.

399
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:50,400
So every character is only three colors.

400
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,660
So here's the address map, which actually I wrote,

401
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,861
hand-wrote this, figured it out from the schematics.

402
00:20:56,843 --> 00:21:01,084
What else could we do? We could look at the graphics ROMs and

403
00:21:01,084 --> 00:21:03,825
slowly piece them apart and figure out how the graphics ROMs

404
00:21:03,825 --> 00:21:10,466
were encoded. But the biggest thing was we could disassemble

405
00:21:10,466 --> 00:21:15,227
the code. We could disassemble the entire thing, all 16K bytes

406
00:21:15,227 --> 00:21:19,228
and print it out. And so it comes out to be about 180 pages.

407
00:21:19,228 --> 00:21:25,749
Okay? The annotated Pac-Man. Now, this actually, this is

408
00:21:27,623 --> 00:21:30,364
This actually was done, this particular printout, this was

409
00:21:30,364 --> 00:21:32,485
done by the junior Pac-Man people.

410
00:21:32,485 --> 00:21:35,145
That's a post-mortem for a different day.

411
00:21:35,145 --> 00:21:39,026
But you can come up and see this, and you can see all the

412
00:21:39,026 --> 00:21:44,187
handwritten notations and the pizza stains and the just

413
00:21:44,187 --> 00:21:48,148
wonderfulness of the annotated Pac-Man.

414
00:21:48,148 --> 00:21:50,368
So we'll have some show and tell afterwards.

415
00:21:50,368 --> 00:21:53,529
There, you like that?

416
00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:54,829
Cool.

417
00:21:54,829 --> 00:21:55,970
Media.

418
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,390
So Tim Hoskins and Bruce Burns were the junior Pac-Man guys.

419
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:07,395
And so that's their handiwork.

420
00:22:07,395 --> 00:22:08,717
What else could we do?

421
00:22:08,717 --> 00:22:09,618
So we could use the 8550.

422
00:22:10,733 --> 00:22:14,815
emulator system. It's sort of like main and hardware. And you

423
00:22:14,815 --> 00:22:17,156
could do, you could set break points and return statements.

424
00:22:17,156 --> 00:22:21,637
Gee, what does this do? And I remember one cool thing we did

425
00:22:21,637 --> 00:22:25,779
right early on was we set some sort of a break point that

426
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:30,001
printed out on the line printer every time a particular routine

427
00:22:30,001 --> 00:22:33,062
got executed. And that essentially put the game into

428
00:22:33,062 --> 00:22:33,783
slo-mo.

429
00:22:34,364 --> 00:22:36,605
which was really cool because you could learn stuff about how

430
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:41,186
the game works. And here's an example. You can see that

431
00:22:41,186 --> 00:22:47,288
pac-man actually skids around the corner a little bit. Watch

432
00:22:47,288 --> 00:22:51,830
him go around the corner. You can see he skids a little bit.

433
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:54,971
So he can go faster than the monsters can as you go around

434
00:22:54,971 --> 00:22:57,352
corners. So that was one thing we learned. And then the other

435
00:22:57,352 --> 00:23:01,613
thing is the monsters look ahead. Watch, he'll look before

436
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:02,973
he actually turns. See?

437
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:14,061
And so you're learning a little bit about how the monster AI

438
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:18,762
works. AI. Z80 with 16K. So that was one thing that we were

439
00:23:18,762 --> 00:23:21,843
able to do. And then another cool thing we did was once we

440
00:23:21,843 --> 00:23:27,784
found the mazes was zero out the maze. And that was really cool

441
00:23:27,784 --> 00:23:31,764
because you could watch the monster move where it wanted to

442
00:23:31,764 --> 00:23:33,245
go without the maze in the way.

443
00:23:34,302 --> 00:23:37,183
That was very cool. There's one particular mode that the monster

444
00:23:37,183 --> 00:23:40,704
gets in that people now call scatter, where it basically

445
00:23:40,704 --> 00:23:43,465
heads for its favorite corner. And it was very obvious when you

446
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:46,186
set it up like this, because there's no maze in the way, and

447
00:23:46,186 --> 00:23:48,807
you could just watch it go straight out to where it was

448
00:23:48,807 --> 00:23:51,108
trying to get to. And then there was another mode it would get

449
00:23:51,108 --> 00:23:53,989
into where it basically turned right every time. And you would

450
00:23:53,989 --> 00:23:56,349
see it there in a little tight little turning, turning,

451
00:23:56,349 --> 00:23:56,710
turning.

452
00:23:57,642 --> 00:23:59,183
So you could see that.

453
00:23:59,183 --> 00:24:01,645
And so you could learn stuff about the game by playing

454
00:24:01,645 --> 00:24:04,567
around with it using the emulation system.

455
00:24:04,567 --> 00:24:08,510
So what were we going to do to get rid of Pac-Man's

456
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:08,971
problems?

457
00:24:08,971 --> 00:24:11,092
Four new mazes.

458
00:24:11,092 --> 00:24:13,654
We said, OK, we're not going to be constrained by memory

459
00:24:13,654 --> 00:24:16,796
space, we're going to add more ROMs if we need to.

460
00:24:16,796 --> 00:24:18,077
So we'll add more mazes.

461
00:24:18,077 --> 00:24:18,918
Why just one maze?

462
00:24:18,918 --> 00:24:19,918
We'll do four.

463
00:24:20,923 --> 00:24:25,606
The big thing is to randomize the monster algorithms so that

464
00:24:25,606 --> 00:24:28,187
the pattern play will not work anymore.

465
00:24:28,187 --> 00:24:32,329
And the way we did this, it is truly random what we did,

466
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:35,571
because there's a free-running counter in the Z80

467
00:24:35,571 --> 00:24:38,653
microprocessor that was used for DRAM refresh.

468
00:24:38,653 --> 00:24:41,654
Remember DRAM refresh?

469
00:24:41,654 --> 00:24:44,656
And you could access it from software, and it made a really

470
00:24:44,656 --> 00:24:44,876
cool.

471
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:51,053
truly random counter. So we used that to drive the algorithm.

472
00:24:51,053 --> 00:24:55,096
And essentially what it did was each monster, instead of going

473
00:24:55,096 --> 00:24:59,138
to a fixed corner, it picked a random corner. And that was

474
00:24:59,138 --> 00:25:02,281
enough randomization in the algorithm to totally screw you

475
00:25:02,281 --> 00:25:05,763
over as a player. The other things we added, the fruit

476
00:25:05,763 --> 00:25:10,806
bonus moves through the maze. You had to chase it. And it

477
00:25:10,806 --> 00:25:12,387
moves through in a random path.

478
00:25:13,635 --> 00:25:19,019
Actually, there were four paths predefined, and it randomly

479
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:20,640
picks one.

480
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,001
Again, truly randomly.

481
00:25:22,001 --> 00:25:24,263
It randomly picks one, and that's the maze, that's the

482
00:25:24,263 --> 00:25:27,066
path it takes going in, and then it randomly picks one of

483
00:25:27,066 --> 00:25:28,487
the four for it to go out.

484
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:33,471
Goes in, goes around the center house, then goes out.

485
00:25:33,471 --> 00:25:35,693
We tried a bunch of other stuff that didn't work.

486
00:25:35,693 --> 00:25:37,374
We thought about vertical tunnels.

487
00:25:38,377 --> 00:25:40,318
you know, there's horizontal tunnels in Pac-Man.

488
00:25:40,318 --> 00:25:41,498
Ooh, what about vertical tunnels?

489
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,639
That would be cool.

490
00:25:42,639 --> 00:25:45,480
And it turned out that the AI for the monsters,

491
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,801
it would never go through them.

492
00:25:46,801 --> 00:25:48,822
So we said, okay, you know, we're not gonna do that.

493
00:25:48,822 --> 00:25:49,842
And we thought about things like,

494
00:25:49,842 --> 00:25:51,043
ooh, what if the monsters can travel

495
00:25:51,043 --> 00:25:53,224
through the walls sometimes?

496
00:25:53,224 --> 00:25:55,005
And so, you know, things we tried,

497
00:25:55,005 --> 00:25:57,486
but never got far enough.

498
00:25:57,486 --> 00:26:00,447
So that's what we ended up with.

499
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:04,985
And then a bunch of non-gameplay features that we added.

500
00:26:04,985 --> 00:26:08,567
The new colors, new sounds, new music, new animations.

501
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,568
What we would, today we would call cut scenes.

502
00:26:11,568 --> 00:26:13,248
But Pac-Man had them as well,

503
00:26:13,248 --> 00:26:14,869
and we thought of our own to put in.

504
00:26:14,869 --> 00:26:18,690
And of course a different name for the main character,

505
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:21,111
because we're looking at trademark issues

506
00:26:21,111 --> 00:26:22,172
and copyright issues.

507
00:26:22,172 --> 00:26:24,412
We can't call it Pac-Man or Super Pac-Man.

508
00:26:24,412 --> 00:26:25,493
Oh, we'll call it Crazy Otto.

509
00:26:27,112 --> 00:26:30,654
So one of the things about the fruit bonus, the first thing we noticed is that

510
00:26:30,654 --> 00:26:34,276
there's six, the hardware supports six moving characters

511
00:26:34,276 --> 00:26:39,539
in the Pac-Man hardware. But the fruit never moves.

512
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:42,601
Well, let's move it. That's something cool. It's free in the hardware.

513
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:46,083
So we'll move it around the maze. And the other thing is

514
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:49,645
buried in the Pac-Man graphics ROM, there's an explosion character.

515
00:26:51,391 --> 00:26:51,992
OK, we can use that.

516
00:26:51,992 --> 00:26:54,774
So the first thought was, let's have the fruit move

517
00:26:54,774 --> 00:26:58,116
through the maze and then explode.

518
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,898
If you haven't got it in time, it blows up.

519
00:26:59,898 --> 00:27:03,961
And we used that for a while.

520
00:27:03,961 --> 00:27:06,383
But then ended up with what we have now, where it bounces in

521
00:27:06,383 --> 00:27:07,063
and it bounces out.

522
00:27:08,577 --> 00:27:09,477
So the sounds and the path.

523
00:27:09,477 --> 00:27:14,481
And then the value, that funny diagonal number there, because

524
00:27:14,481 --> 00:27:17,604
if you did the bonus when you eat the fruit, if you did it

525
00:27:17,604 --> 00:27:19,966
the way Pac-Man did it, it looked really ugly because it

526
00:27:19,966 --> 00:27:24,930
overwrote the maze to put the big 1,000, 5,000

527
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,011
number on there.

528
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,712
So we came up with our own.

529
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:30,394
That's why it's sort of squenched down like that.

530
00:27:30,394 --> 00:27:33,117
Maze design, it's all on paper.

531
00:27:36,505 --> 00:27:41,068
So we still have all this, but you could see the try this, try

532
00:27:41,068 --> 00:27:43,210
this. So there's several things we tried. But basically if it

533
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:46,412
worked okay, yeah, stick with it and move on to the next maze.

534
00:27:46,412 --> 00:27:49,675
So we came up with four mazes. So here's our four mazes all

535
00:27:49,675 --> 00:27:51,617
lined up together. And the thought was, so Pac-Man, people

536
00:27:51,617 --> 00:27:51,677
are

537
00:28:00,115 --> 00:28:02,796
somewhat used to, oh, here's a Pac-Man game that's been

538
00:28:02,796 --> 00:28:05,717
modified. It has a different maze. So they get started on

539
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:08,659
our game and they play that first maze and they get through

540
00:28:08,659 --> 00:28:12,780
the first couple of racks and then, wham, yet another maze.

541
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,522
And they would be used to the first maze and then, boom,

542
00:28:15,522 --> 00:28:18,343
here's a totally different one. And that lasts for a few racks

543
00:28:18,343 --> 00:28:20,744
and then, boom, another maze. And then that lasts for a few.

544
00:28:20,744 --> 00:28:23,105
And by the time you've gotten through the fourth maze, I mean,

545
00:28:23,105 --> 00:28:26,226
you're a really good player. And so four seemed like a good

546
00:28:26,226 --> 00:28:26,467
number.

547
00:28:29,512 --> 00:28:34,681
Music. Any musicians? Music? Yeah. So Chris Rode did all the

548
00:28:34,681 --> 00:28:38,908
music for Ms. Pac-Man and I love his title for the code there.

549
00:28:38,908 --> 00:28:41,032
It says Sonata for Unaccompanied Video Game.

550
00:28:43,192 --> 00:28:46,094
And that's the only piece of music, actually, paper.

551
00:28:46,094 --> 00:28:49,476
I mean, he used it, composed it at the piano at our house in

552
00:28:49,476 --> 00:28:51,598
Wayland, and wrote it down.

553
00:28:51,598 --> 00:28:54,180
I mean, that's actually, even the staffs are handwritten on

554
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:57,362
the piece of paper with his hand notations there.

555
00:28:57,362 --> 00:29:02,626
So music, the game start up, and three animations.

556
00:29:02,626 --> 00:29:04,728
So he wrote all the music for that.

557
00:29:04,728 --> 00:29:05,708
And so.

558
00:29:07,326 --> 00:29:10,493
we're talking about Crazy Auto. All right. You ready? Here's the

559
00:29:10,493 --> 00:29:13,721
first animation. Oh, this is attract mode. I'm sorry. So

560
00:29:13,721 --> 00:29:15,285
this is an early attract mode.

561
00:29:16,023 --> 00:29:20,545
And the names came from Phil Carrot who was a physics

562
00:29:20,545 --> 00:29:22,826
student at MIT and worked for us for the summer.

563
00:29:22,826 --> 00:29:23,506
So hence the names.

564
00:29:23,506 --> 00:29:26,188
There's Otto, and there's the monsters.

565
00:29:26,188 --> 00:29:29,109
So this is essentially a Pac-Man attract mode.

566
00:29:29,109 --> 00:29:33,051
And we hacked it up really quickly as a demo, just so that

567
00:29:33,051 --> 00:29:34,832
we could put it out on test, for example.

568
00:29:34,832 --> 00:29:37,933
And notice our logo, GenComp, General Computer on there.

569
00:29:37,933 --> 00:29:41,655
So this is our first shot at the attract mode.

570
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:44,816
But the other part of attract mode is the.

571
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:50,364
the fake-o game. And so we can watch Otto play here. This is

572
00:29:50,364 --> 00:29:52,826
again where you can see the randomness because some of the

573
00:29:52,826 --> 00:29:56,850
randomness is the algorithm for how Otto moves during the fake

574
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:00,192
game. It's actually one of the monster algorithms repurposed.

575
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:03,275
And so you never know how long he's going to play in the

576
00:30:03,275 --> 00:30:03,895
attract mode.

577
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:07,212
we always worried that he might actually complete the maze

578
00:30:07,212 --> 00:30:11,515
during the attract mode. And what would happen then? So you

579
00:30:11,515 --> 00:30:15,618
can see auto and you see the monsters. And wow, he's doing

580
00:30:15,618 --> 00:30:21,603
really well. Oh, missed the fruit. And up he comes. And you

581
00:30:21,603 --> 00:30:24,925
can see our new monster designs. Again, it was a trademark thing.

582
00:30:24,925 --> 00:30:29,269
We want the monsters to look a little different. And wow, he's

583
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:33,272
doing really well. Look at that. Pretty good for randomness.

584
00:30:35,555 --> 00:30:41,358
And finally, yeah, he dies. And he spins around. Dead. Dead

585
00:30:41,358 --> 00:30:46,861
auto. Okay. So, and here's a detail of auto. So you can see,

586
00:30:46,861 --> 00:30:50,504
he's actually got this sort of 3D. He turns away from you, and

587
00:30:50,504 --> 00:30:55,527
he turns toward you. Right? Isn't that cool? Yeah, auto.

588
00:30:58,336 --> 00:30:59,276
So what else did we do?

589
00:30:59,276 --> 00:31:01,537
So we did the cut scenes, the animations.

590
00:31:01,537 --> 00:31:04,697
And this was Mike Horowitz, one of our developers, who

591
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:08,518
came up with the idea and coded up the animation driver.

592
00:31:08,518 --> 00:31:19,961
So there.

593
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,001
Obviously, the red one is the female.

594
00:31:22,001 --> 00:31:26,663
So all we did was you took the same character and used a

595
00:31:26,663 --> 00:31:27,363
different palette.

596
00:31:28,077 --> 00:31:29,099
Pick the different three colors.

597
00:31:29,099 --> 00:31:31,584
And you try all the available palettes.

598
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,646
Those are really ugly.

599
00:31:32,646 --> 00:31:32,926
Red.

600
00:31:32,926 --> 00:31:33,948
Ooh, red looks good.

601
00:31:33,948 --> 00:31:34,028
OK.

602
00:31:34,028 --> 00:31:35,451
So we have the two of them.

603
00:31:35,451 --> 00:31:39,939
And let's see animation number two with Chris's wonderful

604
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:40,921
little ragtime tune.

605
00:32:03,726 --> 00:32:04,867
Well done, well done Chris.

606
00:32:04,867 --> 00:32:09,609
So, actually very sophisticated sound synthesis in Pac-Man.

607
00:32:09,609 --> 00:32:13,370
And so we had to learn how the Pac-Man music driver worked

608
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:16,432
and put our own tables in there to drive the music.

609
00:32:16,432 --> 00:32:18,032
So it's not even composing, but again,

610
00:32:18,032 --> 00:32:19,613
reverse engineering the music driver

611
00:32:19,613 --> 00:32:21,514
so that you can figure out how to do it.

612
00:32:21,514 --> 00:32:23,535
And finally, the final animation.

613
00:32:23,535 --> 00:32:27,216
And I'm done.

614
00:32:30,869 --> 00:32:37,414
little baby Otto there. So that's how we know it's male and female, right? Because they procreate there. They have baby.

615
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:48,782
So, anyway, so this was a fun thing. It breaks up the game. It's fun. It gives the player a break a little bit.

616
00:32:48,782 --> 00:32:54,125
And then you want to know, is there an act four? What's going to happen next? It drives the player to do more.

617
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,730
So character design, well where'd the idea from Otto come from?

618
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:01,461
Well partly it came from, if you look at the side of a Pac-Man game.

619
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:06,030
Who's that? I mean, it's got feet and it's got eyes, and so

620
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:10,253
we started thinking about that. Now, the hand-drawn there,

621
00:33:10,253 --> 00:33:13,876
that's, I believe that's Chris Rhodes writing. And that was

622
00:33:13,876 --> 00:33:19,741
his first thought about Otto having the eyes and the feet

623
00:33:19,741 --> 00:33:22,222
and how it would look. And it actually looks a lot more

624
00:33:22,222 --> 00:33:25,445
similar to what the monsters are, but initially that was his

625
00:33:25,445 --> 00:33:27,847
thought for the main hero character, for the Otto

626
00:33:27,847 --> 00:33:28,607
character. So...

627
00:33:32,955 --> 00:33:33,756
Any artists here?

628
00:33:33,756 --> 00:33:36,137
You guys do character design?

629
00:33:36,137 --> 00:33:36,878
Yeah.

630
00:33:36,878 --> 00:33:38,439
OK, here's a workflow for us.

631
00:33:38,439 --> 00:33:41,641
So you would take your character idea.

632
00:33:41,641 --> 00:33:44,623
You'd sketch it on graph paper like Chris did in the

633
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:45,383
previous slide.

634
00:33:45,383 --> 00:33:49,566
You'd have to manually encode it into the weird encoding

635
00:33:49,566 --> 00:33:51,347
that the graphics ROMs needed.

636
00:33:52,993 --> 00:33:57,596
type it in, program the ROM, burn the ROM, stick it into the

637
00:33:57,596 --> 00:34:01,118
circuit board and then see how it actually looked on the

638
00:34:01,118 --> 00:34:03,259
screen. Because we had no control over the screen

639
00:34:03,259 --> 00:34:06,841
directly. All we have control over is the processor. And the

640
00:34:06,841 --> 00:34:10,523
screen, there's no bit map in this thing. It drives one line

641
00:34:10,523 --> 00:34:18,188
at a time. And so it's this long process fraught with error.

642
00:34:18,188 --> 00:34:22,030
It takes a while. There must be a better way. Chris came up

643
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:22,670
with a better way.

644
00:34:23,945 --> 00:34:28,746
light bright. Anybody play with a light bright? I mean, actual

645
00:34:28,746 --> 00:34:32,947
old light bright? Not the new modern ones, but the ones with

646
00:34:32,947 --> 00:34:36,368
the little pegs? Light bright. So I know Chris used this for

647
00:34:36,368 --> 00:34:38,689
some of the character development. So here's how it

648
00:34:38,689 --> 00:34:45,350
looks, right? So you can see on the right there, so you can't

649
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:48,251
use every hole because it's this weird hexagonal shape. So you

650
00:34:48,251 --> 00:34:49,191
take every other hole.

651
00:34:50,007 --> 00:34:53,550
so that you stay on the Manhattan geometries.

652
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:56,373
And what do you do with the holes when you make a hole plug

653
00:34:56,373 --> 00:34:57,654
for the mistake?

654
00:34:57,654 --> 00:34:59,156
With a mistake there, how do you fill in the hole?

655
00:34:59,156 --> 00:35:00,117
Like, ah, I thought of this.

656
00:35:00,117 --> 00:35:05,622
You take the dark purple plug, and you get the black Sharpie

657
00:35:05,622 --> 00:35:07,584
and cover it up, and you can plug up the light leaking

658
00:35:07,584 --> 00:35:09,486
through the hole you don't want.

659
00:35:09,486 --> 00:35:11,928
So it actually worked pretty well.

660
00:35:14,429 --> 00:35:15,870
That's what it looks like.

661
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:19,813
So you'd put a sheet of white paper over it like a diffuser,

662
00:35:19,813 --> 00:35:23,115
and you'd kind of turn off the lights in the room and step

663
00:35:23,115 --> 00:35:24,916
back, and you could kind of play with it.

664
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:25,536
It's really cool.

665
00:35:25,536 --> 00:35:26,097
It's tactile.

666
00:35:26,097 --> 00:35:27,537
You plug in, what about this color?

667
00:35:27,537 --> 00:35:28,218
What about this?

668
00:35:28,218 --> 00:35:31,920
That's what you do today, but which one do you like better?

669
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,241
It worked.

670
00:35:33,241 --> 00:35:35,062
So anyway, so that was light bright.

671
00:35:35,062 --> 00:35:38,985
That was kind of a fun thing to use for character

672
00:35:38,985 --> 00:35:39,825
development.

673
00:35:39,825 --> 00:35:41,426
So we changed the fruits.

674
00:35:42,923 --> 00:35:46,166
the Pac-Man fruit bonuses. Do you know why they're fruit

675
00:35:46,166 --> 00:35:51,890
bonuses, by the way? It's slot machine bonuses. Did you ever

676
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:55,433
notice that? Slot machines, they were actually slot machines

677
00:35:55,433 --> 00:35:59,536
that were called fruit machines because they gave out fruit gum

678
00:35:59,536 --> 00:36:02,718
as a bonus, as a prize. So if you lined up cherries, you got

679
00:36:02,718 --> 00:36:03,759
cherry gum.

680
00:36:04,733 --> 00:36:06,635
that's why they were there and that's why they were picked.

681
00:36:06,635 --> 00:36:09,838
And the same thing with the bell and the key,

682
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:13,000
those were typical slot machine bonuses.

683
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,382
So we wanted everything to be edible, number one.

684
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:19,106
Number two, we wanted to avoid any trademark issues,

685
00:36:19,106 --> 00:36:21,407
so that's when we got rid of the Galaxian character.

686
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:25,611
and then we got rid of the stupid grapes that nobody knew

687
00:36:25,611 --> 00:36:29,472
they were grapes. People said, oh, that green one there, oh,

688
00:36:29,472 --> 00:36:33,093
that's the grenade. No, it's a bunch of grapes. It just looks

689
00:36:33,093 --> 00:36:36,434
stupid because it's only 14 pixels on a side. So let's get

690
00:36:36,434 --> 00:36:41,816
rid of that one. So we did our own. And the pretzel was sort of

691
00:36:41,816 --> 00:36:45,777
in honor of Kevin Curran because he liked salty things, so we put

692
00:36:45,777 --> 00:36:48,478
in a pretzel and it wasn't very healthy. Everything else is

693
00:36:48,478 --> 00:36:50,978
fruity and healthy and here's Kevin's pretzel.

694
00:36:53,604 --> 00:36:57,346
So again, back to our intellectual property.

695
00:36:57,346 --> 00:36:58,206
We're doing all this.

696
00:36:58,206 --> 00:37:01,128
And we're really getting good at intellectual property

697
00:37:01,128 --> 00:37:03,109
because we're in the middle of our lawsuit now with Atari,

698
00:37:03,109 --> 00:37:03,869
remember?

699
00:37:03,869 --> 00:37:06,350
And all the things they're complaining about, oh, jeez,

700
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,711
we won't do that again.

701
00:37:07,711 --> 00:37:10,573
So we're designing that into this kit.

702
00:37:10,573 --> 00:37:16,435
Change the characters, change the name, and protect our code.

703
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:21,738
And our code overlaid on top of the existing Midway Namco

704
00:37:21,738 --> 00:37:21,918
code.

705
00:37:22,624 --> 00:37:26,785
So let's talk about source code for a minute. Oh, by the way,

706
00:37:26,785 --> 00:37:30,706
source code, more show and tell. I have the Ms. Pac-Man source

707
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:35,507
code here in paper. And so you can come up and look at it

708
00:37:35,507 --> 00:37:40,668
later if you want. Because so what do I have? This one isn't

709
00:37:40,668 --> 00:37:45,229
marked up at all. This is just a printout from our 8-inch floppy.

710
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:50,210
So we can look at that. So source code looks like this.

711
00:37:50,903 --> 00:37:53,945
here's the fruit driver. This code is to make the fruit bounce

712
00:37:53,945 --> 00:37:57,988
across the screen. And it goes count zero spaces and then goes

713
00:37:57,988 --> 00:38:03,311
poof. So this is the code obviously represents the comment

714
00:38:03,311 --> 00:38:05,992
represents code that is no longer there. You don't do that,

715
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:06,092
do you?

716
00:38:06,938 --> 00:38:09,119
Do you leave old comments lying around in your code?

717
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,320
Gosh, the horror.

718
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,801
So, but that's what that is.

719
00:38:11,801 --> 00:38:16,123
A lot of what we did ended up being tables.

720
00:38:16,123 --> 00:38:17,644
Tables for code we wrote,

721
00:38:17,644 --> 00:38:20,405
and tables that use the existing Pac-Man code.

722
00:38:20,405 --> 00:38:22,667
For example, the maze.

723
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,268
Maze is a big table.

724
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:25,308
Now we have four mazes,

725
00:38:25,308 --> 00:38:27,770
so you had to do some code to select which one to use,

726
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:28,870
but it's basically a table.

727
00:38:30,522 --> 00:38:32,704
So let me talk about the patches.

728
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:36,208
How do we get our hooks into the existing Pac-Man code?

729
00:38:36,208 --> 00:38:39,992
So the hardware allowed us to do these little

730
00:38:39,992 --> 00:38:42,835
eight byte patches.

731
00:38:42,835 --> 00:38:46,399
And the hardware would dynamically look at the address

732
00:38:46,399 --> 00:38:48,982
and would say, oh, you're in one of the eight byte patches.

733
00:38:50,067 --> 00:38:53,769
And then boom, and it would replace, dynamically replace

734
00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:57,430
the code with our own code, generally with something like

735
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,490
a jump statement.

736
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:01,352
And boom, and it would jump off into our own address space

737
00:39:01,352 --> 00:39:02,912
where all of our new code would be.

738
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:06,354
So you can see, here's the patches.

739
00:39:06,354 --> 00:39:07,974
And it tells you where it is.

740
00:39:07,974 --> 00:39:09,175
And oh, the top one is easy.

741
00:39:09,175 --> 00:39:10,235
It's just an XOR.

742
00:39:11,035 --> 00:39:15,719
instruction. We wanted to modify one instruction. So that's pretty easy. But the second one down

743
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:22,205
there, patch for new attract mode. So at that location in Pac-Man address space, you jump out

744
00:39:22,205 --> 00:39:28,190
to some of our code. So that's how that worked. Here's some more patches. Oh, those bottom four,

745
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:33,295
those are the really clever ones. The patch to make the monsters move randomly.

746
00:39:33,295 --> 00:39:34,236
Randomize the AI.

747
00:39:38,725 --> 00:39:42,546
There's 40 of those patches. 40 of the 8-byte patches. And that

748
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:45,127
was a limitation. It was a hardware limitation. We could

749
00:39:45,127 --> 00:39:48,767
not support an infinite number of patches. Only 40. Complicated

750
00:39:48,767 --> 00:39:51,748
reasons as to why that was. But that limited what we could do.

751
00:39:51,748 --> 00:39:56,109
There's only so much we could do in modifying the game. This is

752
00:39:56,109 --> 00:39:59,929
from the third, from some of the animation code, and you can see

753
00:39:59,929 --> 00:40:05,831
by Mike's comments there, his definitions, that there's two

754
00:40:05,831 --> 00:40:07,731
characters. One is called Otto, and the other is called Anna.

755
00:40:08,371 --> 00:40:10,375
So I guess Ms. Pagman's name is Anna.

756
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:12,358
Who knew?

757
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:12,979
So...

758
00:40:12,979 --> 00:40:15,042
Okay, let's go back to Atari for a second.

759
00:40:15,042 --> 00:40:17,186
Remember the Atari settlement?

760
00:40:21,543 --> 00:40:24,446
One of the things in the Atari settlement was we will not

761
00:40:24,446 --> 00:40:27,869
market an enhancement kit without the permission of the

762
00:40:27,869 --> 00:40:30,911
manufacturer. Now, Atari figures, yeah, who's going to

763
00:40:30,911 --> 00:40:34,674
give these clowns permission to modify a game? Nobody's going to

764
00:40:34,674 --> 00:40:37,237
do it. And we pushed back and said, look, we've been working

765
00:40:37,237 --> 00:40:40,259
all these months while we've been in court with you guys. We

766
00:40:40,259 --> 00:40:44,162
have this kit done. We want to be able to sell it. Okay. So

767
00:40:44,162 --> 00:40:49,967
that got put into our agreement with Atari. So Kevin.

768
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,800
This is a huge bluff here.

769
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,181
Nobody knows about our agreement with Atari.

770
00:40:57,181 --> 00:40:57,601
That's secret.

771
00:40:57,601 --> 00:41:02,063
All the industry knows is that Atari dropped their lawsuit.

772
00:41:02,063 --> 00:41:02,383
So Kevin,

773
00:41:08,408 --> 00:41:12,670
you know, 21-year-old MIT dropout, calls Dave Moravsky of

774
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,971
Midway, president of Midway. Midway who has the most popular

775
00:41:15,971 --> 00:41:19,093
game in the western hemisphere right now, Pac-Man. And he's

776
00:41:19,093 --> 00:41:23,835
just annoyed as heck because there's all sorts of copyright

777
00:41:23,835 --> 00:41:28,016
violations going on. People wholesale pirating his game and

778
00:41:28,016 --> 00:41:31,458
making copies of it. There's people making Pac-Man T-shirts

779
00:41:31,458 --> 00:41:34,999
and Pac-Man trash cans and all this. And he's just in court all

780
00:41:34,999 --> 00:41:36,299
the time trying to shut these people down.

781
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:39,068
and here's somebody who calls him up first.

782
00:41:39,068 --> 00:41:39,889
So he's kind of cool.

783
00:41:39,889 --> 00:41:41,990
And Kevin kind of goes like this.

784
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:46,294
Kevin says, hey, you may have heard that

785
00:41:46,294 --> 00:41:48,215
we trounced and pounded Atari in court

786
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:51,518
and they dropped their lawsuit.

787
00:41:51,518 --> 00:41:54,580
We're about to do the same thing to you.

788
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,041
We're about to bring out a kit

789
00:41:56,041 --> 00:41:57,843
and we just want, if any, disagreements

790
00:41:57,843 --> 00:42:00,445
you think you may have, let's settle them now

791
00:42:00,445 --> 00:42:02,947
because we don't want to have to take you to court too.

792
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:13,038
So Dave says, hey, why don't you come out and talk to us?

793
00:42:13,038 --> 00:42:14,018
Sure thing.

794
00:42:14,018 --> 00:42:15,919
So we go out to visit Midway.

795
00:42:15,919 --> 00:42:18,801
This is the day after we signed the Atari deal.

796
00:42:18,801 --> 00:42:19,942
They were both in Chicago.

797
00:42:19,942 --> 00:42:24,225
It was a really good week for us here.

798
00:42:26,489 --> 00:42:28,850
And Dave, they gave us a tie.

799
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:30,711
They're like, here guys, here have a tie.

800
00:42:30,711 --> 00:42:35,072
So I still have this, my Pac-Man tie from that first visit.

801
00:42:35,072 --> 00:42:38,813
And it took a few weeks to negotiate things

802
00:42:38,813 --> 00:42:40,994
and finally by the end of October,

803
00:42:40,994 --> 00:42:45,115
we negotiated an agreement with them that,

804
00:42:45,115 --> 00:42:47,956
hey, we're going to buy this kit from you

805
00:42:47,956 --> 00:42:49,917
and maybe we'll do it as a new game.

806
00:42:49,917 --> 00:42:51,057
Maybe we'll sell it as a kit.

807
00:42:51,057 --> 00:42:52,018
Maybe we'll do it as a new game.

808
00:42:52,018 --> 00:42:53,818
But Midway's going to market it.

809
00:42:54,304 --> 00:42:59,166
sure. Okay. No problem. So remember, they don't know about

810
00:42:59,166 --> 00:43:02,447
our Atari deal. And I think in the back of their minds they're

811
00:43:02,447 --> 00:43:07,409
thinking, hey, we can have these kids do more stuff for us. Sorry.

812
00:43:07,409 --> 00:43:12,810
It's like a one shot deal. You just don't know it yet. So here

813
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:16,752
in one month, we've struck deals with the top two game

814
00:43:16,752 --> 00:43:18,032
manufacturers in the country.

815
00:43:18,822 --> 00:43:21,364
It's just like, dude, we're having a good time here.

816
00:43:21,364 --> 00:43:23,907
It's like looking better and better that dropping out of

817
00:43:23,907 --> 00:43:27,351
school was the thing to do.

818
00:43:27,351 --> 00:43:30,113
So we're already talking at this point about changing the

819
00:43:30,113 --> 00:43:33,677
name to Super Pac-Man because we don't have the trademark

820
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:34,338
issues anymore.

821
00:43:34,338 --> 00:43:36,100
So we can change it to Super Pac-Man.

822
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:36,540
ROM dumps.

823
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,182
This turns out to be really critical later.

824
00:43:39,318 --> 00:43:42,941
is my ROM dumps that I made October 29th so we can go back

825
00:43:42,941 --> 00:43:45,402
and show what we're able to do right then. Backups are

826
00:43:45,402 --> 00:43:48,304
important. If you're a code developer, backups are

827
00:43:48,304 --> 00:43:51,786
important. Who's hosting your repository? Do you have access

828
00:43:51,786 --> 00:43:54,527
to it? You never know when you'll need proof of ownership.

829
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:59,733
Ask me why I know. Ask me in about five minutes. So here's

830
00:43:59,733 --> 00:44:03,975
by then we had written a new attract mode and we didn't know

831
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:06,797
is it going to be crazy auto, is it going to be super pac-man.

832
00:44:06,797 --> 00:44:10,099
So we had both by then and we had come up with this cool

833
00:44:10,099 --> 00:44:12,941
midway logo because they're giving us money. We're going to

834
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:15,822
be nice to them. And then Stan calls and I took this phone

835
00:44:15,822 --> 00:44:18,664
call. This is early November. Stan calls up. I answer the

836
00:44:18,664 --> 00:44:23,167
phone. Stan says, hey, we want to make the female character the

837
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,167
main character of the game.

838
00:44:25,353 --> 00:44:27,776
We're going to call it Miss Pac-Man.

839
00:44:27,776 --> 00:44:28,676
M-I-S-S. Miss Pac-Man.

840
00:44:28,676 --> 00:44:29,938
It's going to be cool.

841
00:44:29,938 --> 00:44:34,181
Stan, there's all these 14-year-old boys in the arcade.

842
00:44:34,181 --> 00:44:35,723
Aren't they going to be turned off by that?

843
00:44:35,723 --> 00:44:36,323
He's like, no, no, no, no.

844
00:44:36,323 --> 00:44:37,104
It's really cool.

845
00:44:37,104 --> 00:44:40,167
Because Pac-Man is very popular with girls and women.

846
00:44:40,167 --> 00:44:42,469
And we're like, yeah, yeah, OK, sure, fine, no problem.

847
00:44:42,469 --> 00:44:43,170
We'll do that.

848
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:44,991
So we made the female character.

849
00:44:44,991 --> 00:44:46,092
What's she going to look like?

850
00:44:46,092 --> 00:44:51,037
So let's show some of the character changes and name

851
00:44:51,037 --> 00:44:51,377
changes.

852
00:44:53,592 --> 00:44:57,495
So the top line is crazy auto. And you can see auto actually

853
00:44:57,495 --> 00:45:00,898
was fairly complicated because pac-man is just three

854
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:04,140
characters to do pac-man. And auto, there's four going each

855
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:06,322
direction. Because there's four when he goes left and right and

856
00:45:06,322 --> 00:45:09,745
there's four when he goes away and toward you. And then if it's

857
00:45:09,745 --> 00:45:12,127
super pac-man, well, it's just back to pac-man and maybe he

858
00:45:12,127 --> 00:45:15,590
rotates and that's about it. But the first thing we did when we

859
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:16,731
went to miss.

860
00:45:17,163 --> 00:45:20,724
Pac-Man was that next to the bottom one where she's got the

861
00:45:20,724 --> 00:45:24,485
red hair and she still has the 3D movement where she turns

862
00:45:24,485 --> 00:45:27,066
toward you and she turns away from you. When she's turning

863
00:45:27,066 --> 00:45:29,907
away from you, all you see is the red and it looks kind of

864
00:45:29,907 --> 00:45:35,769
like the red monster. And also fairly quickly, this is all in

865
00:45:35,769 --> 00:45:39,830
the span of like a week, two weeks. Fairly quickly someone

866
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:44,112
realized, oh, my gosh, she has a baby. We cannot have her be

867
00:45:44,112 --> 00:45:45,472
Miss Pac-Man.

868
00:45:48,044 --> 00:45:54,326
out of wedlock video game birth. No. So pack woman. Okay. So it

869
00:45:54,326 --> 00:46:00,208
almost was pack woman. And then finally very quickly, Ms.

870
00:46:00,208 --> 00:46:04,469
Pac-Man. Okay. Ms. Pac-Man. Great. And the character ended

871
00:46:04,469 --> 00:46:06,450
up the character we know and love at the bottom where she has

872
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:10,371
a bow and she's got a beauty mark and she's got a blinky eye

873
00:46:10,371 --> 00:46:14,152
with eyelashes and that's pretty good for 14 by 14 pixels.

874
00:46:15,811 --> 00:46:18,813
You know, the hardware supports 16 by 16, but you have to leave

875
00:46:18,813 --> 00:46:24,178
a black row all the way around so that it doesn't collide with

876
00:46:24,178 --> 00:46:28,421
the maze. So it's 14 by 14. Pretty cool.

877
00:46:28,421 --> 00:46:33,185
Despite what you might read on the internet, imagine.

878
00:46:33,185 --> 00:46:35,968
Internet got something wrong. Namco knew about this right

879
00:46:35,968 --> 00:46:38,930
from the start. Namco knew about this, and in fact, they were

880
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,952
involved with the design of the character.

881
00:46:41,808 --> 00:46:47,794
and Nakamura-san commented that he did not like the red hair.

882
00:46:47,794 --> 00:46:49,896
And so that was one of the reasons why we got rid of the

883
00:46:49,896 --> 00:46:52,758
character with the red hair and ended up with the character

884
00:46:52,758 --> 00:46:56,983
with the bow. So Namco absolutely knew about this kit

885
00:46:56,983 --> 00:47:00,486
right from the start. And we ended up with Ms. Pac-Man the

886
00:47:00,486 --> 00:47:01,047
way she is now.

887
00:47:02,318 --> 00:47:05,920
This is the hardware design.

888
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:10,002
There's 16K ROM, Pac-Man code, and then we have 10K

889
00:47:10,002 --> 00:47:14,043
on our little aux board, and an interesting encryption,

890
00:47:14,043 --> 00:47:15,944
quote, encryption, with the bit swizzle.

891
00:47:15,944 --> 00:47:18,525
So you cannot just copy, take the ROM

892
00:47:18,525 --> 00:47:22,967
off of the Ms. Pac-Man aux board and learn how to do it.

893
00:47:23,912 --> 00:47:27,555
learn anything from the code and the anti-copying hardware.

894
00:47:27,555 --> 00:47:30,418
Remember our original goal was not to copy the original code.

895
00:47:30,418 --> 00:47:33,161
At this point it doesn't matter. And really it's more

896
00:47:33,161 --> 00:47:37,385
interesting because it makes it difficult to copy the game. And

897
00:47:37,385 --> 00:47:42,050
it kept the pirates away. Ms. Pac-Man was not cloned, was not

898
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:43,812
pirated for about six months.

899
00:47:44,354 --> 00:47:48,700
which allowed midway to really ramp up the production,

900
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,562
which was pretty awesome.

901
00:47:50,562 --> 00:47:54,928
So thanks to, that was my code.

902
00:47:54,928 --> 00:47:57,471
The anti-copying hardware.

903
00:47:57,471 --> 00:47:59,914
And if you look at your Ms. Pac-Man aux kit,

904
00:48:00,908 --> 00:48:04,131
what's the part number on there? CG. That's our CG prefix

905
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:07,073
again. So a little bit of general computer there. And

906
00:48:07,073 --> 00:48:11,237
that's what it looks like inside. So on the left of that,

907
00:48:11,237 --> 00:48:14,840
that's all Pac-Man. That's just a generic Pac-Man board. And

908
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,162
then the aux board plugs in and changes it. And we

909
00:48:19,247 --> 00:48:21,970
got a patent on our anti-copying. So that was kind of

910
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:25,994
cool. And again, it wasn't pirated for six months. So

911
00:48:25,994 --> 00:48:29,999
basically what it does is it watches for an access that would

912
00:48:29,999 --> 00:48:33,622
never happen during normal game operation. And if it sees that,

913
00:48:33,622 --> 00:48:37,506
it says, ah, you're one of those evil pirates that's trying to

914
00:48:37,506 --> 00:48:40,810
dump the code from this game, and I'm going to hose you over.

915
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:42,432
And it changes the encryption algorithm.

916
00:48:43,842 --> 00:48:47,884
dynamically. Hidden messages in the game. There's the Namco

917
00:48:47,884 --> 00:48:50,766
Easter egg. You know about this? This is in Pac-Man, but you can

918
00:48:50,766 --> 00:48:55,209
actually get to it in Ms. Pac-Man as well. We didn't know

919
00:48:55,209 --> 00:48:59,011
about it, so we didn't take it out. It's there. Ms. Pac-Man in

920
00:48:59,011 --> 00:49:02,013
the character ROM, you see the gen comp there in the middle on

921
00:49:02,013 --> 00:49:05,395
the left? That was from our logo from our original attract mode,

922
00:49:05,395 --> 00:49:08,977
and it's still in there. So in every Ms. Pac-Man produced,

923
00:49:08,977 --> 00:49:09,437
there it is.

924
00:49:10,665 --> 00:49:13,827
And but then way buried in the code is this little message.

925
00:49:13,827 --> 00:49:17,088
General Computer Corporation, hello Nakamura, at the very end

926
00:49:17,088 --> 00:49:20,789
of it. So we put that in there. Why would you do this? Well,

927
00:49:20,789 --> 00:49:26,111
because it's interesting to prove infringement with someone

928
00:49:26,111 --> 00:49:29,093
else's code. You can go and find this. Ask me how I know.

929
00:49:30,855 --> 00:49:34,036
Bugs. A couple of bugs. There was a parking bug. There was a

930
00:49:34,036 --> 00:49:39,059
place you could hide in the first maze and the monsters

931
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:42,080
wouldn't get to you. So we had to fix that. The very last thing

932
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:45,341
we found, because we did not have a cocktail table, was it

933
00:49:45,341 --> 00:49:49,183
didn't work correctly in cocktail mode. And so we had to

934
00:49:49,183 --> 00:49:53,645
fix that. The collision bug where you can go through the

935
00:49:53,645 --> 00:49:55,606
monster, we knew about that and left it alone.

936
00:49:56,484 --> 00:49:59,165
And then the last one, players always ask me this because

937
00:49:59,165 --> 00:50:01,666
they're all about playing to the end of the game.

938
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:04,788
And the level 255 bug, you know about this, right?

939
00:50:04,788 --> 00:50:06,709
You get to level 255 and it goes crazy.

940
00:50:06,709 --> 00:50:07,549
Did you know about that?

941
00:50:07,549 --> 00:50:08,790
You should have fixed it.

942
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:11,991
Listen, if you get to that bug, how long have you been

943
00:50:11,991 --> 00:50:13,972
playing the game?

944
00:50:13,972 --> 00:50:14,452
Five hours?

945
00:50:14,452 --> 00:50:19,295
That's the bug, is that you've been playing the game for five

946
00:50:19,295 --> 00:50:19,535
hours.

947
00:50:20,562 --> 00:50:23,684
Okay. I want you dropping another quarter in there after

948
00:50:23,684 --> 00:50:26,926
three minutes. If we had found that, we would have just laughed

949
00:50:26,926 --> 00:50:30,149
and said, yeah, we don't care. We would have made the game

950
00:50:30,149 --> 00:50:33,771
harder so you would never get there is what we would have

951
00:50:33,771 --> 00:50:37,354
done. So final code release in late January 1982. And it goes

952
00:50:37,354 --> 00:50:40,996
into production. Also January 1982. This is how we used to get

953
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:44,439
news. High resolution, full color, solar powered portable

954
00:50:44,439 --> 00:50:45,300
news delivery system.

955
00:50:47,967 --> 00:50:50,555
Random access, delivered to your desktop weekly.

956
00:50:50,555 --> 00:50:54,968
This is actually an amazing article about the state of the

957
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:55,910
game industry in 1982.

958
00:50:58,605 --> 00:50:59,445
It's phenomenal.

959
00:50:59,445 --> 00:51:02,267
And so Mike Horowitz gets this game, gets this magazine, and

960
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:04,849
he comes into our new development space

961
00:51:04,849 --> 00:51:05,309
there in Cambridge.

962
00:51:05,309 --> 00:51:08,451
And in the upper right there, you can, this is the opening

963
00:51:08,451 --> 00:51:10,873
spread for the article, in the upper right you can see a

964
00:51:10,873 --> 00:51:12,234
missile command game.

965
00:51:12,234 --> 00:51:14,015
He's like, guys, is this Super Missile Attack?

966
00:51:14,015 --> 00:51:14,435
Can you tell?

967
00:51:14,435 --> 00:51:16,856
And we're looking at it, and we're like, no, can't quite

968
00:51:16,856 --> 00:51:19,458
tell, the colors aren't changed, and maybe it's Super

969
00:51:19,458 --> 00:51:20,699
Missile Attack, maybe you can't tell.

970
00:51:20,699 --> 00:51:23,361
And then we look at the lower right.

971
00:51:23,361 --> 00:51:23,861
Oh my god, it's Crazy Otto.

972
00:51:30,158 --> 00:51:34,943
You know, Pac-Man scuttles about the maze. No. It's Crazy Otto. Okay.

973
00:51:34,943 --> 00:51:38,126
Do the math here. There's a hundred and ten thousand Pac-Man cabinets in the US.

974
00:51:38,126 --> 00:51:39,688
Three of them

975
00:51:39,688 --> 00:51:43,872
have been modified for Crazy Otto and are out on test.

976
00:51:43,872 --> 00:51:46,635
And the photographer picked one

977
00:51:46,635 --> 00:51:47,415
to take the picture of.

978
00:51:48,068 --> 00:51:52,469
So for 30 years, this has been the mythical Pac-Man with legs.

979
00:51:52,469 --> 00:51:53,309
Oh, my God, what is it?

980
00:51:53,309 --> 00:51:54,470
Well, it was Crazy Otto.

981
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:55,970
It was our game out on test.

982
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:56,951
And who knew?

983
00:51:56,951 --> 00:51:58,911
So again, more press.

984
00:51:58,911 --> 00:52:01,972
More press is good press.

985
00:52:01,972 --> 00:52:03,253
So that's kind of fun.

986
00:52:03,253 --> 00:52:08,254
Who did the development for Crazy Otto and Ms. Pac-Man?

987
00:52:08,254 --> 00:52:11,335
It was the seven of us who did it.

988
00:52:11,335 --> 00:52:13,356
What did General Computer go on to do later?

989
00:52:13,356 --> 00:52:16,037
We did Foodfighting Quantum.

990
00:52:16,597 --> 00:52:18,919
for Atari, coin op games. We also did a coin op game,

991
00:52:18,919 --> 00:52:23,083
Nightmare, that was never produced. We did Junior Pac-Man,

992
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:26,707
coin op game for Midway. Then also for Atari we did a

993
00:52:26,707 --> 00:52:34,515
phenomenal amount of home titles for Atari over those few years,

994
00:52:34,515 --> 00:52:35,116
1982 through 1984.

995
00:52:36,723 --> 00:52:38,845
We also did the Atari 7800 pro system.

996
00:52:38,845 --> 00:52:40,746
Their next generation game unit.

997
00:52:40,746 --> 00:52:42,988
We did the entire thing.

998
00:52:42,988 --> 00:52:45,910
We did the custom graphics processor.

999
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:47,792
We did 14 cartridges for launch.

1000
00:52:47,792 --> 00:52:50,214
We did very novel encryption.

1001
00:52:50,214 --> 00:52:52,475
You want a good post-mortem talk, this one.

1002
00:52:52,475 --> 00:52:54,217
This would be a cool talk.

1003
00:52:54,217 --> 00:52:57,379
So that was the pro system.

1004
00:52:57,379 --> 00:53:00,402
Oh, we didn't design the plastic box.

1005
00:53:00,402 --> 00:53:01,603
That came from Atari.

1006
00:53:01,603 --> 00:53:04,145
But everything else we did.

1007
00:53:04,145 --> 00:53:05,286
Here's General Computer in 1984.

1008
00:53:07,233 --> 00:53:13,597
at the height of our game design. But 1984 was notable for the

1009
00:53:13,597 --> 00:53:16,159
video game crash, Atari.

1010
00:53:17,226 --> 00:53:22,029
got sold to Jack Tramiel and everything went away and what

1011
00:53:22,029 --> 00:53:25,551
are we going to do now? Well, luckily GCC lived on as GCC

1012
00:53:25,551 --> 00:53:29,433
technologies and since we were good at hacking things, we

1013
00:53:29,433 --> 00:53:32,395
hacked the Macintosh, which had just been introduced in

1014
00:53:32,395 --> 00:53:35,997
February and we did the first internal hard disk for the Apple

1015
00:53:35,997 --> 00:53:39,720
Macintosh, which Steve Jobs had been assured by his engineers

1016
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:40,660
was impossible to do.

1017
00:53:41,765 --> 00:53:47,768
So we were pretty thrilled about that and went on to do more Mac peripherals, laser printers,

1018
00:53:47,768 --> 00:53:51,770
a company called Video Guide, which did an early set-top box.

1019
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:58,873
So on we went. And ex-GCCers went on to do great things in industry.

1020
00:53:58,873 --> 00:54:04,576
So it was quite the breeding ground for tech founders and tech managers.

1021
00:54:04,576 --> 00:54:05,957
But, 20 years later.

1022
00:54:05,957 --> 00:54:07,958
What happens 20 years later?

1023
00:54:12,047 --> 00:54:16,608
Kevin's taking a drive and he's on the mass pike and he stops at

1024
00:54:16,608 --> 00:54:18,629
a rest stop and he sees this game. 20th anniversary of Ms.

1025
00:54:18,629 --> 00:54:23,171
Pac-Man. Introduced in 2001 by Namco. And then they did a 25th

1026
00:54:23,171 --> 00:54:29,573
anniversary later on. And Kevin's first thought, of

1027
00:54:29,573 --> 00:54:34,635
course, is where's my royalty check? So let's review, shall

1028
00:54:34,635 --> 00:54:37,296
we? So we had a number of contracts and lawsuits.

1029
00:54:41,416 --> 00:54:44,738
We actually had to sue Midway at one point and trounce them

1030
00:54:44,738 --> 00:54:48,561
like we promised we would. So Kevin is like, hey, look,

1031
00:54:48,561 --> 00:54:53,944
October of 83 we actually had a contract with NAMCO. At this

1032
00:54:53,944 --> 00:54:58,387
point Ms. Pacman is done. It is done, 1983. No more coin op, no

1033
00:54:58,387 --> 00:55:03,289
more trash cans, no more nothing. So we sign a yeah, yeah,

1034
00:55:03,289 --> 00:55:06,291
yeah. If we ever make any more, we'll pay you this much. Dude,

1035
00:55:06,291 --> 00:55:07,692
you're making them again.

1036
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:13,873
So it took a while to negotiate and we eventually went into

1037
00:55:13,873 --> 00:55:17,234
demand for arbitration. They didn't know we had a contract.

1038
00:55:17,234 --> 00:55:20,976
It was 20 years later. All those people are gone from NAMCO.

1039
00:55:20,976 --> 00:55:25,777
We had to fax them the contract. See? All right. So let's talk

1040
00:55:25,777 --> 00:55:30,459
about language. The language in your contract, the language

1041
00:55:30,459 --> 00:55:33,860
matters. Okay? Let me tell you why it matters. What's different

1042
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:35,141
about these two machines? You notice?

1043
00:55:38,362 --> 00:55:40,544
We get paid for one and not for the other.

1044
00:55:40,544 --> 00:55:40,884
Here's a hint.

1045
00:55:40,884 --> 00:55:41,644
The one on the left has a coin slot.

1046
00:55:41,644 --> 00:55:45,187
So we get paid for those.

1047
00:55:45,187 --> 00:55:50,631
Because the contract says coin-operated game.

1048
00:55:51,828 --> 00:55:54,612
and the arbitrator said coin operated game means

1049
00:55:54,612 --> 00:55:56,093
coin operated game. We're like no no no no no

1050
00:55:56,093 --> 00:56:00,298
that's what we called these big arcade things back then. We just

1051
00:56:00,298 --> 00:56:03,101
generically referred to them as that. He's like

1052
00:56:03,101 --> 00:56:05,824
coin operated means coin operated.

1053
00:56:05,824 --> 00:56:09,248
So we don't get any royalties unless it's actually coin operated.

1054
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:14,413
Here's another phrase. This is very wordy. The highlights come

1055
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:17,654
from the arbitrator. This is where we won big in our

1056
00:56:17,654 --> 00:56:22,755
language. We get paid for electronic distribution. This

1057
00:56:22,755 --> 00:56:26,615
is Kevin Curran wrote this. Electronic distribution of the

1058
00:56:26,615 --> 00:56:31,376
game. If it's in any other way transmitted to any other

1059
00:56:31,376 --> 00:56:38,798
receiving device, like, say, cell phone. Or your X box.

1060
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:45,181
And so nobody had thought about cell phones back then, but this

1061
00:56:45,181 --> 00:56:47,763
was read very expansively by the arbitrator, so we got it.

1062
00:56:47,763 --> 00:56:52,607
And we had to reverse engineer to show usage of our code, and

1063
00:56:52,607 --> 00:56:54,428
our hello Nakamura message was found.

1064
00:56:54,428 --> 00:56:57,731
So that was one way we showed usage of our code.

1065
00:57:01,073 --> 00:57:06,738
And here's the six of us after our arbitration successfully

1066
00:57:06,738 --> 00:57:08,820
was found mostly in our favor.

1067
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:10,181
Six of us who worked on it.

1068
00:57:10,181 --> 00:57:13,164
We're still getting royalties.

1069
00:57:13,164 --> 00:57:13,925
Mostly.

1070
00:57:13,925 --> 00:57:17,028
They kind of dropped off in the last year or so.

1071
00:57:17,028 --> 00:57:19,270
So buy more for your phone.

1072
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:22,066
And thank you.

1073
00:57:22,066 --> 00:57:24,828
Oh, I've got to thank the Pac-Man people.

1074
00:57:24,828 --> 00:57:27,129
Iwatani-san, who I've never met and would love to.

1075
00:57:27,129 --> 00:57:29,611
Because if they had not made Pac-Man, we would never have

1076
00:57:29,611 --> 00:57:30,992
been able to make Ms. Pac-Man.

1077
00:57:30,992 --> 00:57:34,915
And my final comment is, you know, this is

1078
00:57:34,915 --> 00:57:36,416
called a post-mortem.

1079
00:57:36,416 --> 00:57:39,598
But a post-mortem means somebody died.

1080
00:57:39,598 --> 00:57:42,240
And I don't see that maybe it's a post-partum.

1081
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,241
Ms. Pac-Man lives on.

1082
00:57:44,241 --> 00:57:45,082
Thank you.

1083
00:57:45,082 --> 00:57:46,102
Thank you very much.

1084
00:57:46,102 --> 00:57:47,343
We have a few minutes for questions.

1085
00:57:55,988 --> 00:57:57,009
Thank you.

1086
00:57:57,009 --> 00:57:57,689
Any questions?

1087
00:57:57,689 --> 00:58:00,170
Anybody jumping up?

1088
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:00,410
Yes?

1089
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:00,570
Yes.

1090
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:05,092
Can you say something very briefly

1091
00:58:05,092 --> 00:58:08,454
about how the AI for the ghosts work?

1092
00:58:08,454 --> 00:58:11,935
Just sort of the general rules about how the very simple

1093
00:58:11,935 --> 00:58:14,876
processor pilots them around.

1094
00:58:14,876 --> 00:58:19,618
I will attempt to, because mostly,

1095
00:58:21,329 --> 00:58:25,033
We didn't change it. We didn't need to understand how it

1096
00:58:25,033 --> 00:58:27,857
worked. We just needed to understand how to modify it a

1097
00:58:27,857 --> 00:58:31,881
little bit. But basically the monsters are in one of several

1098
00:58:31,881 --> 00:58:35,966
modes. They're either in their scatter mode of going to a

1099
00:58:35,966 --> 00:58:40,511
corner of the maze, or they're chasing the Pac-Man, or they're

1100
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,492
running away from it.

1101
00:58:42,158 --> 00:58:44,960
that's basically it. I think there's a fourth mode that no

1102
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,923
one knows about much. But that's it. And how do they stay in

1103
00:58:48,923 --> 00:58:53,866
those modes? Partly it's time. How long have you been on a

1104
00:58:53,866 --> 00:58:57,708
particular maze and then it switches into attack mode and

1105
00:58:57,708 --> 00:59:02,131
that changes as the mazes move on. So it's somewhat table

1106
00:59:02,131 --> 00:59:09,155
driven. That's why later in later racks, you never get any

1107
00:59:09,155 --> 00:59:11,937
time where you're not being attacked and not being chased.

1108
00:59:12,552 --> 00:59:15,794
so. Oh, one more thing. Please be sure to fill out your

1109
00:59:15,794 --> 00:59:18,114
evaluation forms that you'll get by e-mail. So do that. Yes.

1110
00:59:18,114 --> 00:59:22,016
And you asked a great question, so come up here. We have a gift

1111
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:25,557
for you. You see my son Jacob. Jacob here, who, by the way,

1112
00:59:25,557 --> 00:59:28,419
was the world champion at crazy auto for many years because he

1113
00:59:28,419 --> 00:59:30,779
was the only person who got to play it because it was in my

1114
00:59:30,779 --> 00:59:31,200
basement.

1115
00:59:32,836 --> 00:59:37,599
so uh... we took it to california extreme one year people got to play it may be

1116
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,980
your score so

1117
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:40,040
uh... any other questions who else yes

1118
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:43,342
uh... what are your thoughts about modifying existing games today uh...

1119
00:59:43,342 --> 00:59:47,124
there and that there's a lot of companies that uh...

1120
00:59:47,124 --> 00:59:50,786
don't take kindly to their games being modified and there's

1121
00:59:50,786 --> 00:59:55,249
some companies that will release games with you know full uh... level editors

1122
00:59:55,249 --> 00:59:59,051
especially on back in the nineties that was a a big thing

1123
01:00:00,787 --> 01:00:06,830
Do you like the way the legal precedents are going?

1124
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:12,832
Or do you think maybe it could be a little more liberal?

1125
01:00:12,832 --> 01:00:14,293
That's a great question too.

1126
01:00:14,293 --> 01:00:16,234
You get a gift, come up and see Jacob.

1127
01:00:16,234 --> 01:00:18,955
So it depends on how I'm making my money.

1128
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:26,563
Okay? If I'm selling new games, well, I want my new games and

1129
01:00:26,563 --> 01:00:29,546
you'd better not modify them. If I'm making money doing

1130
01:00:29,546 --> 01:00:32,189
modifications, then I would change it differently.

1131
01:00:32,466 --> 01:00:34,747
Let me answer your question another way.

1132
01:00:34,747 --> 01:00:39,108
I think the law has been more settled now,

1133
01:00:39,108 --> 01:00:42,550
and I could reel off all the cases that have happened

1134
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:46,531
in the past 30 years, to give the original designer

1135
01:00:46,531 --> 01:00:49,812
of the game much more legal standing

1136
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:52,193
and control over their game.

1137
01:00:52,193 --> 01:00:56,095
And so I think it makes it much more difficult

1138
01:00:56,095 --> 01:00:59,616
as a, to legally modify it.

1139
01:00:59,776 --> 01:01:04,071
original developer does not want you to. Okay?

1140
01:01:05,098 --> 01:01:07,779
Now, let me put my opinion hat on.

1141
01:01:07,779 --> 01:01:11,520
I think that that can be a great thing to make your game more

1142
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,860
popular if you allow it to be modified.

1143
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:16,181
So I think it's really cool for people to say, hey, here's a

1144
01:01:16,181 --> 01:01:17,341
level editor.

1145
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:20,222
Go at it and have some fun at it.

1146
01:01:20,222 --> 01:01:23,383
But intellectual property is important.

1147
01:01:23,383 --> 01:01:24,503
This is how you make your money.

1148
01:01:24,503 --> 01:01:25,904
And so it deserves to be protected.

1149
01:01:25,904 --> 01:01:27,704
So just imagine, you might be that other guy.

1150
01:01:27,704 --> 01:01:31,045
As soon as we got hired by Atari, we were like, oh, that

1151
01:01:31,045 --> 01:01:31,705
was evil.

1152
01:01:32,186 --> 01:01:35,970
Enhancement kit people, we're going to stop that.

1153
01:01:35,970 --> 01:01:38,132
Because that's how we were making our money.

1154
01:01:38,132 --> 01:01:38,693
All of a sudden.

1155
01:01:38,693 --> 01:01:39,955
So, thank you.

1156
01:01:39,955 --> 01:01:40,735
Yeah, come see Jacob.

1157
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:42,538
Come see him.

1158
01:01:42,538 --> 01:01:43,298
Anybody else?

1159
01:01:43,298 --> 01:01:45,141
One more question maybe.

1160
01:01:45,141 --> 01:01:45,261
Yes.

1161
01:01:47,472 --> 01:02:02,041
Yes? Oh, we got to stop. We got to stop. I will be at this wrap-up room, which we have to go all the way into the West Hall, room 2022, and I'll have all my goody things to show, and so feel free to follow me over there. Thank you very much.
