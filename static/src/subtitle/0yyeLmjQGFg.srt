1
00:00:04,784 --> 00:00:12,226
afternoon. It's 1.20. Good producers start on time, right? So let's get that. How's GDC so far?

2
00:00:14,066 --> 00:00:17,647
Awesome. And the volunteers do an awesome job. You guys should give them a hand.

3
00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:24,329
Some of you might have been volunteers once.

4
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,572
I had an opportunity a long time ago now, back when GDC.

5
00:00:29,632 --> 00:00:31,554
Who went to GDC when I was still in San Jose?

6
00:00:32,594 --> 00:00:32,994
Anybody?

7
00:00:33,555 --> 00:00:33,915
Thank you.

8
00:00:33,955 --> 00:00:35,016
I'm glad I'm not the only one.

9
00:00:35,176 --> 00:00:36,076
We've got a few.

10
00:00:36,297 --> 00:00:36,577
Awesome.

11
00:00:37,317 --> 00:00:38,638
It's grown a little bit since then.

12
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:42,280
Today we're going to be talking about high

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,841
performance producers.

14
00:00:43,901 --> 00:00:46,043
We're going to be talking about production generally.

15
00:00:46,063 --> 00:00:47,684
I hope you're in the right place.

16
00:00:47,744 --> 00:00:49,465
If you're not, it's your last chance to get out.

17
00:00:49,485 --> 00:00:52,887
I would hate you to have to sit through an hour of this if

18
00:00:53,047 --> 00:00:54,448
it's not what you were planning for.

19
00:00:56,802 --> 00:00:58,543
Please make sure that your phones are off,

20
00:00:58,563 --> 00:00:59,503
you know, all that jazz.

21
00:01:00,784 --> 00:01:01,965
And at the end of the talk,

22
00:01:02,785 --> 00:01:05,266
we always ask that you rate us.

23
00:01:05,386 --> 00:01:06,867
We love being reviewed,

24
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:10,268
and especially as producers.

25
00:01:10,308 --> 00:01:12,309
I imagine most of us in here in production,

26
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,271
it's sort of our trade, right?

27
00:01:15,471 --> 00:01:18,252
So I'd appreciate getting some kind of review at the end,

28
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,173
preferably better than worse,

29
00:01:20,653 --> 00:01:21,874
but we'll see if I earn it or not.

30
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:27,991
So I've been at Gearbox, what, 10 years now?

31
00:01:28,032 --> 00:01:29,236
I've been in the industry about 20 years.

32
00:01:31,835 --> 00:01:38,198
I was at Origin in the late 90s, was on the team just when we were launching Ultima Online.

33
00:01:38,678 --> 00:01:43,040
I worked in flight combat sims, right on the tail end of Wing Commander.

34
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:48,263
Seen a lot of cool stuff, but I'll tell you what, some of the coolest stuff I'm seeing

35
00:01:48,323 --> 00:01:49,343
is happening right now.

36
00:01:49,483 --> 00:01:55,066
I mean, we birthed a lot of things industry-wise between MMOs and had the benefit to go up

37
00:01:55,106 --> 00:01:59,548
to Dallas where shooters were created and working with some of the best shooter developers

38
00:01:59,629 --> 00:02:00,349
out there right now.

39
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,271
But the stuff I'm seeing in the indie scene is knocking me out.

40
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:08,833
How many of you here are on teams of like less than 50, let's say?

41
00:02:10,134 --> 00:02:10,815
Fantastic.

42
00:02:11,115 --> 00:02:14,397
There's so much exciting stuff happening that you guys are doing.

43
00:02:14,477 --> 00:02:15,377
It inspires me.

44
00:02:15,537 --> 00:02:17,058
So please keep doing that.

45
00:02:17,118 --> 00:02:18,479
I know everybody's ambition.

46
00:02:18,499 --> 00:02:19,339
Well, I don't know.

47
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:22,241
It seems like we're doing well in indie space, so I'll let it go with that.

48
00:02:23,802 --> 00:02:25,503
There are 44 slides if you're counting.

49
00:02:26,263 --> 00:02:27,484
Hopefully you're not counting too close.

50
00:02:28,624 --> 00:02:29,225
Let's get started.

51
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:33,426
So let's just clarify.

52
00:02:33,446 --> 00:02:35,227
I always like to define things.

53
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:38,230
We're talking about high-performance production.

54
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,673
So rather than just have assumptions, let's check

55
00:02:42,713 --> 00:02:45,895
those, I'm saying that when I talk about high-performance

56
00:02:45,955 --> 00:02:48,717
producers, I'm not talking about just any producers.

57
00:02:48,737 --> 00:02:52,360
And I'm not talking about people who are in easy jobs.

58
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,861
Not that production's ever easy.

59
00:02:53,961 --> 00:02:57,504
But there are some that you slide in by.

60
00:02:57,524 --> 00:02:59,925
This is not for people who are just getting by.

61
00:02:59,965 --> 00:03:01,026
This is for people who work.

62
00:03:01,727 --> 00:03:04,568
in high-pressure environments where time is critical,

63
00:03:04,748 --> 00:03:05,868
where speed is key.

64
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:10,290
I would say that's the case for everybody.

65
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,131
It's not, you know, it's more true for some than others.

66
00:03:15,732 --> 00:03:17,852
And if you feel like you're under the gun all the time,

67
00:03:18,673 --> 00:03:20,573
there's just a few techniques that you can use,

68
00:03:20,593 --> 00:03:22,334
some of which you may already be employing,

69
00:03:22,914 --> 00:03:23,974
but some which I use

70
00:03:25,055 --> 00:03:27,336
and that I just want to talk about here with you guys.

71
00:03:29,656 --> 00:03:29,877
You know.

72
00:03:30,988 --> 00:03:33,772
Operating at greater speed or greater power than others,

73
00:03:33,812 --> 00:03:34,853
things of the same kind.

74
00:03:34,973 --> 00:03:37,196
When you are out there in the industry,

75
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,459
you want to be noticed as someone

76
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:41,502
who's extremely valuable in production.

77
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:43,384
Someone who, when you're added to a team,

78
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:45,387
you are a force multiplier.

79
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:47,970
And it's because you have tools in your toolbox

80
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:49,052
that not everybody has.

81
00:03:51,748 --> 00:03:54,389
Now, high-performance producers are very active,

82
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:55,889
but they're not hyperactive.

83
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:00,050
And sometimes we kind of go too far in the other direction.

84
00:04:00,751 --> 00:04:02,691
Sometimes we forget that we also have

85
00:04:02,731 --> 00:04:05,172
to be the voice of reason a lot of times,

86
00:04:05,552 --> 00:04:08,612
or we have to be the ones reigning in feature creep

87
00:04:08,712 --> 00:04:10,773
or everybody's great ideas.

88
00:04:11,313 --> 00:04:13,593
The thing about games is everybody has an idea.

89
00:04:13,613 --> 00:04:18,535
And we need producers to be mediating those

90
00:04:18,655 --> 00:04:21,135
so that things can be done feasibly and on time.

91
00:04:22,275 --> 00:04:24,576
Some characteristics of hyperactive producers,

92
00:04:24,636 --> 00:04:26,797
just so you know when you're around one,

93
00:04:27,397 --> 00:04:29,017
or if somebody's mentioning it to you,

94
00:04:29,137 --> 00:04:31,838
maybe you see this in yourself, impatient.

95
00:04:31,878 --> 00:04:34,359
Now it's okay to be impatient about a lot of things.

96
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:37,319
In fact, I tell producers at Gearbox sometimes,

97
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:40,120
it's okay to be unreasonable about things

98
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,860
when you need to be.

99
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,481
But if you're characterized as constantly impatient,

100
00:04:44,841 --> 00:04:46,622
then everybody just goes tone deaf on you,

101
00:04:46,642 --> 00:04:47,622
and you don't want that, right?

102
00:04:48,536 --> 00:04:50,057
They have difficulty focusing.

103
00:04:50,137 --> 00:04:51,939
And you're going to see this mirror is actually very close

104
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,803
here with ADHD, which I think can be a gift in game

105
00:04:55,843 --> 00:04:59,526
development, but also presents a lot of problems when you're

106
00:04:59,546 --> 00:05:00,647
working in a team environment.

107
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:04,190
And this is one of those first big ones that it presents a

108
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,913
problem with, is in building trust and stability.

109
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:09,034
When you have someone who's bouncing off the walls all the

110
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:13,178
time, or always seems to be cranked three notches up more

111
00:05:13,218 --> 00:05:15,240
than anybody else, while that could be.

112
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,623
you know, good leadership sometimes, if it's a constant,

113
00:05:18,803 --> 00:05:20,725
then again, people tend to go tone deaf.

114
00:05:20,845 --> 00:05:21,446
We don't want that.

115
00:05:22,927 --> 00:05:25,069
And also, this type of person,

116
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,672
who many of us probably have worked with,

117
00:05:27,732 --> 00:05:29,614
tend to favor quantity over quality.

118
00:05:29,654 --> 00:05:33,137
They believe that you have to go wide early.

119
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:36,200
One of the reasons for this, at least in my experience is,

120
00:05:37,621 --> 00:05:40,284
Because they don't focus on one thing at any given time

121
00:05:40,344 --> 00:05:42,325
and need a lot of things to think about,

122
00:05:42,726 --> 00:05:44,627
they tend to put a lot into the pipes.

123
00:05:44,688 --> 00:05:46,569
And so you just kind of have to watch out for that.

124
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,931
And if this person is, say, your manager,

125
00:05:48,991 --> 00:05:52,254
you can do a lot to help the project by just pointing out

126
00:05:52,314 --> 00:05:53,856
to that person, this is what you're seeing in them.

127
00:05:54,496 --> 00:05:56,138
And they also tend to over-centralize control.

128
00:05:56,178 --> 00:05:57,980
Because they get so many things in the pipe that

129
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,562
are all in their head, this can not just happen with producers,

130
00:06:00,702 --> 00:06:02,203
but with anybody on the team.

131
00:06:03,765 --> 00:06:06,346
If you see these characteristics in somebody

132
00:06:06,447 --> 00:06:07,587
in command and control,

133
00:06:08,108 --> 00:06:11,570
and in this idea of low self-accountability,

134
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,811
that they're pushing a lot of decisions out,

135
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:15,853
but they themselves aren't holding themselves accountable,

136
00:06:16,173 --> 00:06:17,534
again, you can point out to them,

137
00:06:17,554 --> 00:06:19,855
this is something I heard in the GDC talk,

138
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,637
you sort of fit this mold, let's talk about it.

139
00:06:23,618 --> 00:06:25,179
I don't imagine anybody's really seeing that,

140
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:28,481
but if you are, it's good to have that chat.

141
00:06:29,637 --> 00:06:30,558
So high trust teams.

142
00:06:31,438 --> 00:06:34,199
When we talk about high performance, how do you get to

143
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:34,800
high performance?

144
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,800
How do you get to speed?

145
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,182
And how do you do it so that things are being done in an

146
00:06:39,422 --> 00:06:43,263
accurate and precise way, both, and minimal error?

147
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:45,464
That's kind of the holy grail at speed.

148
00:06:45,824 --> 00:06:47,685
Well, the first key is high trust.

149
00:06:47,725 --> 00:06:49,006
And we hear about trust a lot.

150
00:06:49,246 --> 00:06:51,067
But it's not like this nebulous thing.

151
00:06:51,127 --> 00:06:53,468
It's not this thing that just you and your best friend have

152
00:06:53,549 --> 00:06:54,569
or you and your family have.

153
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:58,191
We have key things that we use, tools

154
00:06:58,231 --> 00:07:00,673
that we employ to build trust with people on our teams.

155
00:07:00,693 --> 00:07:03,574
And it surprises me, actually, how infrequently

156
00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:07,537
I see producers, especially, trying

157
00:07:08,597 --> 00:07:10,499
to employ these methods to build trust,

158
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:13,380
rather than just assuming that it's

159
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,381
something that will develop.

160
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:19,786
Uh-oh.

161
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:25,009
Always more than one way.

162
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:26,529
So let's grade that.

163
00:07:29,011 --> 00:07:31,031
Now, in the description of the talk,

164
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,532
this is going to be a bit interactive.

165
00:07:33,773 --> 00:07:37,955
And I'll tell you right now that the last slide is an example

166
00:07:38,415 --> 00:07:41,416
that I hope all of you use to grade yourselves.

167
00:07:41,476 --> 00:07:43,697
I want you to come away with a custom.

168
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:48,021
report card for you to use much like you might,

169
00:07:48,141 --> 00:07:51,063
how many of you are employing Agile and Scrum in here

170
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:54,285
and are using burned down charts and enjoy using that data?

171
00:07:54,465 --> 00:07:55,726
It helps us out a lot.

172
00:07:56,247 --> 00:07:58,789
Well, we should use that same methodology.

173
00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:00,190
You're already employing it.

174
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,271
Let's use it for evaluating ourselves.

175
00:08:02,591 --> 00:08:04,913
Also to help us build a lot of credibility with our teams

176
00:08:04,933 --> 00:08:05,954
when that's why we're doing that.

177
00:08:07,894 --> 00:08:09,215
So let's grade trust a little bit.

178
00:08:09,696 --> 00:08:13,999
First, what have we done to earn the trust of our managers?

179
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,642
We don't tend to think too much about earning

180
00:08:17,682 --> 00:08:22,286
the trust of our managers other than making them happy.

181
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:24,848
And personally, I don't really want.

182
00:08:25,377 --> 00:08:27,477
the people around me trying to make me happy,

183
00:08:27,577 --> 00:08:28,858
I want them doing a good job.

184
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,838
If they're doing a good job, I'm happy.

185
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:32,939
So I would imagine that it's the same with you.

186
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,580
If you're doing a good job, you hope that your manager

187
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,221
and your manager manager is hearing that and is happy.

188
00:08:39,161 --> 00:08:40,602
But specifically, what are the things

189
00:08:40,642 --> 00:08:42,082
that you've done to earn that trust?

190
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,381
And how about of your team?

191
00:08:45,382 --> 00:08:48,544
If all they ever see you for is because there's a touch point

192
00:08:48,584 --> 00:08:50,185
where they are tracking something,

193
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,806
if you are asking the people on your team,

194
00:08:53,287 --> 00:08:55,508
when's this gonna be done, how long is it gonna take,

195
00:08:55,608 --> 00:08:57,309
all those things, well they already expect that,

196
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,312
but that's not really the way to earn trust,

197
00:09:01,612 --> 00:09:03,333
that's the way that they know that you're gonna be there

198
00:09:03,373 --> 00:09:05,035
and that you're basically doing your job,

199
00:09:05,435 --> 00:09:06,616
but it's not much beyond that.

200
00:09:06,636 --> 00:09:08,237
It's like what good are you to them

201
00:09:08,377 --> 00:09:10,178
other than pulling data from them?

202
00:09:10,398 --> 00:09:11,779
You need to go a step beyond that.

203
00:09:14,773 --> 00:09:17,896
Ask yourself this, do you feel your organization trusts you?

204
00:09:18,838 --> 00:09:21,040
Does it trust you enough for you to make these decisions

205
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:21,641
on your own?

206
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:25,725
When we do our performance reviews at the end of the year

207
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:29,229
at Gearbox, we have a question very much like this.

208
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,873
And in your reviews, do you get asked a question like this

209
00:09:32,913 --> 00:09:33,835
in your performance reviews?

210
00:09:35,391 --> 00:09:36,132
Very, very few.

211
00:09:37,072 --> 00:09:37,713
Sad to hear that.

212
00:09:38,093 --> 00:09:40,435
I would wish that everyone gets asked this question

213
00:09:40,495 --> 00:09:42,856
so that it's more transparent to your leads

214
00:09:43,137 --> 00:09:45,078
how you feel and the responsibilities that you have

215
00:09:45,098 --> 00:09:46,019
in the job that you're doing.

216
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,180
So think about this.

217
00:09:50,962 --> 00:09:52,303
Think about it sincerely.

218
00:09:53,778 --> 00:09:55,259
Have you been trusted to make decisions

219
00:09:55,319 --> 00:09:56,680
beyond just the role that you're in?

220
00:09:57,481 --> 00:10:00,243
Are you ever asked into someone else's office

221
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:02,684
who has responsibilities that are maybe greater

222
00:10:02,785 --> 00:10:05,246
or different than yours and asked to consult on something?

223
00:10:05,346 --> 00:10:07,548
Are you a person who's gotten into that kind of seat yet?

224
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,629
And if not, why might that be?

225
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,550
And what sort of conversation can you have about it?

226
00:10:13,672 --> 00:10:14,813
And very often...

227
00:10:16,164 --> 00:10:18,185
This is a key point in why that may be.

228
00:10:18,405 --> 00:10:20,786
If you're not getting asked to have those conversations,

229
00:10:21,206 --> 00:10:24,448
a lot of times it's hard for us to reflect on ourselves

230
00:10:24,888 --> 00:10:26,969
that we're exhibiting that exact same behavior

231
00:10:26,989 --> 00:10:27,629
to other people.

232
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,830
How often do you invite others

233
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,691
to help you make critical decisions?

234
00:10:32,552 --> 00:10:34,933
And how often do you decide that you really just need

235
00:10:34,953 --> 00:10:36,293
to make that decision yourself?

236
00:10:36,773 --> 00:10:37,954
I mean, that could span anything.

237
00:10:40,995 --> 00:10:43,396
And do you give others that opportunity to earn your trust?

238
00:10:45,405 --> 00:10:47,927
You can ask these exact same questions to your leads.

239
00:10:48,887 --> 00:10:51,889
And if they are a good lead and manager, they should be

240
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:54,550
very happy about having this conversation that they likely

241
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,370
don't have very often.

242
00:10:57,876 --> 00:10:59,717
And what opportunities can you create?

243
00:10:59,777 --> 00:11:03,459
I'll tell you that at Gearbox and everywhere I've worked,

244
00:11:04,219 --> 00:11:07,241
anytime there was an opportunity for me to do something

245
00:11:07,321 --> 00:11:09,042
beyond just what was right in front of me,

246
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:10,403
I'd jump at it.

247
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:11,603
I love learning new things.

248
00:11:11,643 --> 00:11:12,764
I like doing new things.

249
00:11:12,924 --> 00:11:14,705
I'd imagine a lot of you are the same way.

250
00:11:15,365 --> 00:11:17,646
What can you do to create those opportunities

251
00:11:17,806 --> 00:11:19,848
and also do it so that they're not a distraction

252
00:11:19,908 --> 00:11:22,089
but are adding on to existing efforts?

253
00:11:22,229 --> 00:11:24,470
A lot of times the first easy one to do is in morale.

254
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,911
I've challenged producers box recently to see who can come up with the coolest

255
00:11:29,951 --> 00:11:33,092
morale building events and I'm really looking there are some amazing things

256
00:11:33,132 --> 00:11:37,853
happening right now I mean I found out that we have a what is it like a

257
00:11:37,873 --> 00:11:41,174
destruction room people can go into and just break everything and get it

258
00:11:41,214 --> 00:11:46,275
recorded on video and now we're using that for our effects team I had no idea

259
00:11:46,295 --> 00:11:49,996
it's amazing I want to see what else people can come up with then no I'm not

260
00:11:50,056 --> 00:11:51,357
worried that that's what they chose to do

261
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,934
Now, LeBron James, I don't know if any of you

262
00:11:56,954 --> 00:11:57,875
are sports fans in here.

263
00:11:58,695 --> 00:12:00,517
LeBron James has a special handshake

264
00:12:00,537 --> 00:12:02,898
he does with every member of his team in the Cavaliers.

265
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:06,881
He has built incredible trust with his team.

266
00:12:06,941 --> 00:12:09,842
And when we talk about high performance teams

267
00:12:10,343 --> 00:12:12,144
and high performance people, I mean,

268
00:12:12,184 --> 00:12:15,606
you really can't get better than LeBron James and the Cavaliers.

269
00:12:18,068 --> 00:12:19,188
Now, I'm not saying everybody in here

270
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,949
needs to develop their own special handshake

271
00:12:20,969 --> 00:12:21,910
with everybody on the team.

272
00:12:23,021 --> 00:12:25,963
But the fact that he's doing it, and he's certainly better

273
00:12:26,023 --> 00:12:30,005
paid than I am, and taking the time to do that with his team,

274
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:33,587
that really says something about the level of commitment

275
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:36,589
that even a star player like that, somebody who we might

276
00:12:36,609 --> 00:12:39,931
think of as a rock star in his industry, who's willing to

277
00:12:39,971 --> 00:12:42,673
take the time to do something like that with his team, you

278
00:12:42,693 --> 00:12:45,594
better believe that team likes playing together, and that

279
00:12:45,614 --> 00:12:47,015
they have a lot of trust with each other.

280
00:12:51,874 --> 00:12:54,115
Let's talk about another area of high performance, sales

281
00:12:54,175 --> 00:12:54,555
culture.

282
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:58,297
This is not one that we tend to be comfortable even thinking

283
00:12:58,357 --> 00:13:00,699
about in the games industry outside of those marketing

284
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,179
people who do marketing stuff.

285
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,042
This talk is more targeted towards people

286
00:13:06,062 --> 00:13:06,782
who are in development.

287
00:13:08,203 --> 00:13:09,803
We developers, we do the hard stuff.

288
00:13:09,944 --> 00:13:12,665
But the fact is that people in sales do really hard stuff.

289
00:13:13,774 --> 00:13:19,436
And there was a period when I had decided to leave Origin

290
00:13:19,456 --> 00:13:22,857
along, when was that, in early 2000s.

291
00:13:24,438 --> 00:13:25,858
I knew what I wanted to do,

292
00:13:25,918 --> 00:13:27,179
but I didn't know how to get there.

293
00:13:27,499 --> 00:13:30,040
And I knew that even though I'd been in the music industry

294
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,000
before that, I didn't know how to pitch to people

295
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:32,961
in the tech industry.

296
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:35,121
So it took a few months.

297
00:13:36,207 --> 00:13:39,528
And I read up and I spent some time with people in sales

298
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,469
and asked them for literature to give me

299
00:13:41,749 --> 00:13:44,150
what could I do to kind of bone up in sales.

300
00:13:44,751 --> 00:13:47,732
And I learned quite a bit about sales culture

301
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:49,353
and it wasn't what I expected it to be.

302
00:13:50,513 --> 00:13:52,154
So a point I'm going to make here is,

303
00:13:53,035 --> 00:13:54,835
there's a lot that we as producers

304
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:56,576
can learn from that kind of culture

305
00:13:56,876 --> 00:13:58,957
that has to perform, that has to deliver something

306
00:13:59,178 --> 00:14:00,218
all the time, all the time.

307
00:14:00,238 --> 00:14:02,059
They're measured in hard numbers.

308
00:14:04,547 --> 00:14:08,509
We, while we, you know, kind of peripherally get measured in that way,

309
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:10,190
we're usually observing the team.

310
00:14:10,671 --> 00:14:15,073
It's rare we get measured in the way that a salesperson gets, gets measured.

311
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:17,054
And I wonder what it would be like if we were.

312
00:14:19,596 --> 00:14:22,477
So certainly demands high performance, very results driven.

313
00:14:23,218 --> 00:14:24,698
It is very customer focused.

314
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:31,692
I was surprised at how team-oriented, say, people who work in a luxury car dealership

315
00:14:31,752 --> 00:14:37,674
or any sort of, especially in luxe areas, how team-oriented they are and how much sharing

316
00:14:37,714 --> 00:14:39,694
there is between people in sales culture.

317
00:14:41,015 --> 00:14:43,015
It's a good thing as a producer to have in your background.

318
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:47,989
But of course, when we think about the individual who comes

319
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:51,631
from that sales background and then putting them into a team

320
00:14:51,671 --> 00:14:54,973
with other game developers, very often I think this is

321
00:14:55,013 --> 00:14:55,594
what we think of.

322
00:14:55,674 --> 00:14:59,476
So I just did a simple search for the ideal salesperson.

323
00:14:59,796 --> 00:15:01,097
And believe it or not, this was one of the top

324
00:15:01,117 --> 00:15:01,998
things that popped up.

325
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,919
I thought it was kind of funny just what would happen if I

326
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,780
put this person into one of my teams.

327
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:09,802
And I think he wouldn't make it very far into the building,

328
00:15:09,882 --> 00:15:10,142
actually.

329
00:15:13,816 --> 00:15:20,501
But I like where his heart is, that he is determined,

330
00:15:21,441 --> 00:15:22,142
disciplined.

331
00:15:22,742 --> 00:15:25,484
He thinks about the impression that he's going to make.

332
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:28,446
He thinks about how he's going to interact with his customers

333
00:15:29,267 --> 00:15:29,967
or her customers.

334
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,910
And then I think about what we really need is that

335
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,051
in somebody like this.

336
00:15:35,071 --> 00:15:35,571
This is Rod.

337
00:15:35,611 --> 00:15:37,853
For those of you who don't know, this

338
00:15:37,913 --> 00:15:38,954
is somebody I respect a lot.

339
00:15:38,974 --> 00:15:39,914
This is Rod Ferguson.

340
00:15:40,977 --> 00:15:43,799
who runs Coalition, his background is Gears,

341
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:44,739
he's making Gears 4.

342
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,180
He has all those same qualities,

343
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:51,642
but without that sales edge.

344
00:15:51,903 --> 00:15:54,904
And so you don't notice it in a great producer.

345
00:15:54,964 --> 00:15:56,085
They have those qualities,

346
00:15:56,245 --> 00:15:57,705
but you don't think about it that way.

347
00:16:02,268 --> 00:16:03,368
So you need to think about...

348
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,792
what your goals are, how are you going to be measured?

349
00:16:07,812 --> 00:16:10,193
This talk is about you grading yourselves.

350
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:11,514
How are you going to measure yourself?

351
00:16:12,155 --> 00:16:14,696
And you need to know what you expect of yourself first.

352
00:16:15,377 --> 00:16:18,599
So another basketball, forgive me for the basketball

353
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:23,142
references, but here we have Michael Jordan, arguably the

354
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:27,344
best, if not one of the top two basketball players and

355
00:16:28,105 --> 00:16:28,685
athletes ever.

356
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:30,927
It's OK, we can argue that point if you want.

357
00:16:33,398 --> 00:16:35,540
But he always visualized what he was going to do

358
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,301
and thought about what he expected from himself.

359
00:16:38,242 --> 00:16:38,943
Are you doing that?

360
00:16:41,685 --> 00:16:43,386
And I liked having a Chow Yun Fat picture

361
00:16:43,406 --> 00:16:45,748
because I was looking for this Confucius quote anyway.

362
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,491
This is a critical one when we think

363
00:16:49,552 --> 00:16:51,353
about evaluating ourselves again.

364
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,935
It's the you don't know what you don't know problem.

365
00:16:55,997 --> 00:16:58,759
But there's wisdom in realizing you don't know stuff.

366
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:03,862
So, and you've probably heard it if you were at other production talks today, and just

367
00:17:04,002 --> 00:17:09,246
in life, you're told, you know, always ask questions and tell people when you don't know.

368
00:17:10,207 --> 00:17:15,971
And it surprises me again how often I come across people, and it does tend to be newer

369
00:17:16,011 --> 00:17:20,054
people who should be saying they don't know more often, who are so afraid to.

370
00:17:20,354 --> 00:17:26,038
And so we need to tear that fear down so that we can mentor and have better, more highly

371
00:17:26,098 --> 00:17:27,880
performant junior people in the industry.

372
00:17:30,638 --> 00:17:32,659
One of the difficulties in preparing for this, though,

373
00:17:32,699 --> 00:17:34,099
was what is a game producer?

374
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:35,320
So I looked around.

375
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,820
I did a bit of a internet search around,

376
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,361
and I like to hit up the same places.

377
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:42,581
So I went to Gamasutra, and I found this really interesting

378
00:17:42,621 --> 00:17:44,402
couple of competing articles.

379
00:17:44,442 --> 00:17:47,282
And I'd love for you to go and read these yourselves after

380
00:17:47,342 --> 00:17:48,323
if you haven't already.

381
00:17:49,783 --> 00:17:55,044
This first one from Ernst and Bosch, who was at Blizzard,

382
00:17:56,245 --> 00:17:58,685
is about the kind of traditional

383
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,882
role of producer in the industry.

384
00:18:02,242 --> 00:18:03,844
The one that comes from Trip Hawkin,

385
00:18:03,884 --> 00:18:07,166
when he brought in producers from the music industry,

386
00:18:07,226 --> 00:18:10,088
thinking about the A&R, the artist and repertoire process,

387
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:12,230
and managing talent.

388
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:16,832
and how that competed with this notion of the project manager.

389
00:18:16,892 --> 00:18:18,433
The producer is project manager.

390
00:18:18,953 --> 00:18:22,475
So one of the difficulties when we talk about measuring

391
00:18:22,516 --> 00:18:25,417
ourselves as producers is that there is no standard still

392
00:18:25,477 --> 00:18:27,599
in the industry of what even a producer is.

393
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:30,200
We have producers and development directors

394
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,622
and project managers and development managers.

395
00:18:32,722 --> 00:18:35,704
And there's at least a dozen different roles

396
00:18:36,184 --> 00:18:38,986
that all amount to what could be the same thing

397
00:18:39,046 --> 00:18:39,986
at some other company.

398
00:18:41,894 --> 00:18:43,735
Now, I don't know even if we're going to get to a point

399
00:18:43,795 --> 00:18:47,316
where we have standardization for this, but it's one of the

400
00:18:47,356 --> 00:18:49,537
hiccups that we have when trying to figure out how to

401
00:18:49,637 --> 00:18:51,958
explain to people in other parts of the

402
00:18:52,018 --> 00:18:53,919
industry what it is we do.

403
00:18:53,959 --> 00:18:55,940
They might think you're one thing when actually you're

404
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,600
something else.

405
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,381
And it's also why I said I want this to be a customized

406
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:03,582
evaluation of you for yourselves, because only you

407
00:19:03,662 --> 00:19:06,003
know, can know all these things of what you expect of

408
00:19:06,023 --> 00:19:08,404
yourself, what others expect of you, what your role, how

409
00:19:08,424 --> 00:19:09,245
it's actually defined.

410
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,826
But there are some basics that everybody needs to know.

411
00:19:15,147 --> 00:19:17,148
And here's some questions you should use to evaluate

412
00:19:17,168 --> 00:19:21,631
yourselves in project lifecycle and product lifecycle

413
00:19:21,691 --> 00:19:22,172
management.

414
00:19:22,932 --> 00:19:24,413
Are we all familiar?

415
00:19:24,453 --> 00:19:28,116
Well, at least the way I'm using these terms, who's not

416
00:19:28,176 --> 00:19:28,676
familiar?

417
00:19:28,696 --> 00:19:31,058
And I know it's always hard to hold up your hand when I'm

418
00:19:31,078 --> 00:19:33,380
asking who's not, but it'll help me target in a little

419
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,462
bit, are you familiar with project lifecycle management,

420
00:19:37,603 --> 00:19:38,303
that concept?

421
00:19:41,345 --> 00:19:44,026
is not familiar, who's not had like a formal course

422
00:19:44,046 --> 00:19:45,687
or something in project life cycle management.

423
00:19:46,087 --> 00:19:47,147
Okay, thank you, thank you.

424
00:19:47,467 --> 00:19:49,308
It's a fair number of us, that's good to know.

425
00:19:49,668 --> 00:19:51,489
And then, and so I will assume then

426
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:54,289
that product life cycle management also is a no.

427
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,870
So I'll talk a little bit, not too far in depth,

428
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:57,811
we don't have time for it,

429
00:19:57,831 --> 00:19:58,991
but I'll talk a little bit about it.

430
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,982
I won't say all these questions out loud.

431
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:06,184
I'm leaving them here, and they'll also be up.

432
00:20:06,624 --> 00:20:09,026
These slides are all going to be available to you online later.

433
00:20:09,046 --> 00:20:11,288
I don't want you to hear me say, you know,

434
00:20:11,348 --> 00:20:12,209
repeat these things.

435
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:14,051
You'll all be asleep in 10 minutes.

436
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:15,152
We don't want that, OK?

437
00:20:16,233 --> 00:20:17,854
But these are important questions

438
00:20:17,934 --> 00:20:21,137
to ask yourselves for both the project and product

439
00:20:21,197 --> 00:20:22,658
side of the house, OK?

440
00:20:22,978 --> 00:20:24,840
And I'm going to try to leave room for questions after as

441
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,040
well.

442
00:20:27,262 --> 00:20:29,304
Absolutely, though, this should be a baseline.

443
00:20:35,024 --> 00:20:40,230
So on the top left there, we have kind of your typical

444
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:45,015
requirements gathering, waterfall approach to project

445
00:20:45,555 --> 00:20:46,056
management.

446
00:20:46,576 --> 00:20:50,400
And on the top right there, the agile lifecycle, which as

447
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,865
you go into these product increments are your sprints

448
00:20:54,925 --> 00:20:55,425
essentially.

449
00:20:56,562 --> 00:21:00,323
And then you have a larger arc for development.

450
00:21:00,483 --> 00:21:03,845
With both of these, it's not reflected as much on the

451
00:21:03,925 --> 00:21:04,745
waterfall side.

452
00:21:06,026 --> 00:21:08,187
But there's some iteration there also.

453
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:12,210
Although I have to say, I'll never forget my first day at

454
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:15,191
Origin, I walk in, and as I'm walking around, I go through

455
00:21:15,211 --> 00:21:17,091
the James Combat Simulations group.

456
00:21:17,411 --> 00:21:19,192
And so these are all project managers.

457
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:21,852
Well, the person who was managing that project at that

458
00:21:21,892 --> 00:21:24,133
time, we'll just call him Brian, because his name was

459
00:21:24,173 --> 00:21:27,633
Brian, he had printed out this Gantt chart that literally

460
00:21:27,673 --> 00:21:28,474
took up the whole wall.

461
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:31,574
And I mean, this thing was probably 12 feet

462
00:21:31,634 --> 00:21:33,815
high by 18 feet long.

463
00:21:34,415 --> 00:21:36,015
It was an amazing piece of art.

464
00:21:37,576 --> 00:21:42,480
And it stayed on that wall for a while and it was never updated and it was monolithic

465
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,201
just like that thing on the top left is.

466
00:21:46,496 --> 00:21:49,318
A key thing about either of these,

467
00:21:49,358 --> 00:21:52,441
how you participate in managing your teams

468
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:55,143
through whichever project methodology you use,

469
00:21:55,824 --> 00:21:57,605
is this one that's kind of front and center here.

470
00:21:58,386 --> 00:22:02,169
This is one that actually gets ignored a lot of the time,

471
00:22:02,269 --> 00:22:04,491
and if you can be someone who masters this part

472
00:22:04,931 --> 00:22:06,693
of what happens in project management,

473
00:22:06,713 --> 00:22:07,514
you're gonna be ahead.

474
00:22:08,114 --> 00:22:08,314
All right?

475
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,275
And I want you to evaluate yourself

476
00:22:10,715 --> 00:22:13,456
on how much you've participated in this part of it.

477
00:22:13,516 --> 00:22:14,416
It's about costing.

478
00:22:14,936 --> 00:22:18,037
It's about the cost of making a change depending on where

479
00:22:18,097 --> 00:22:19,217
you are in development.

480
00:22:19,757 --> 00:22:23,759
And you can see how the cost skyrockets about the time

481
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:24,979
that you're hitting beta there.

482
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,780
I also have the reference here.

483
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,121
Now, this is applied from broad software engineering.

484
00:22:33,141 --> 00:22:35,982
It's not specific to game development,

485
00:22:36,142 --> 00:22:37,743
but it is from a design background.

486
00:22:39,303 --> 00:22:43,098
I haven't actually measured what it is at Gearbox, but I'll bet it's not too far off.

487
00:22:48,347 --> 00:22:51,829
And now here's the product life cycle as opposed

488
00:22:51,849 --> 00:22:53,429
to the project life cycle.

489
00:22:53,849 --> 00:22:56,030
When we talk about wanting to have a long tail,

490
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:59,351
this is where you're launching your game

491
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,192
and how long it lasts in the marketplace

492
00:23:02,272 --> 00:23:04,453
and how quick you are to respond to launching

493
00:23:04,473 --> 00:23:07,014
the next product that comes on the heels of that one.

494
00:23:07,634 --> 00:23:10,776
But since our industry is so diverse now, how many of you

495
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:13,076
are in mobile, are in mobile development?

496
00:23:13,942 --> 00:23:14,263
Awesome.

497
00:23:14,383 --> 00:23:17,325
And how many of you are in, say, more PC-focused,

498
00:23:17,405 --> 00:23:18,485
like Steam development?

499
00:23:19,226 --> 00:23:22,448
And how many of you are in console, AAA?

500
00:23:24,009 --> 00:23:24,229
See?

501
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:27,431
Where it looks split, like in thirds to me.

502
00:23:27,931 --> 00:23:29,773
And there's a different product lifecycle.

503
00:23:31,193 --> 00:23:32,395
really for each of those.

504
00:23:33,436 --> 00:23:37,102
And now even the segmentation within those,

505
00:23:37,242 --> 00:23:39,646
whereas it was more static in console before,

506
00:23:39,686 --> 00:23:40,467
is so different now.

507
00:23:40,767 --> 00:23:43,251
We see console actually looking a lot more like mobile

508
00:23:43,331 --> 00:23:45,174
with some free-to-play games in console.

509
00:23:45,755 --> 00:23:49,796
So we have to be really adaptive as producers where we could, again, I said,

510
00:23:50,956 --> 00:23:55,797
there are those who could kind of more coast, not that our jobs are ever easy.

511
00:23:56,198 --> 00:24:01,579
But if you don't have to apply, say, this mobile product lifecycle to

512
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:06,380
a console game, what we thought used to be hard in console development,

513
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,261
with just releasing patches, is getting much harder.

514
00:24:10,862 --> 00:24:13,843
And so it's one of the reasons teams are growing,

515
00:24:13,883 --> 00:24:15,663
why it's getting harder to manage these things.

516
00:24:16,184 --> 00:24:18,044
I see somebody who knows that intimately.

517
00:24:21,826 --> 00:24:23,486
And here's another one about why this needs

518
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:25,267
to be so customized for you.

519
00:24:26,748 --> 00:24:29,028
What type of management style is expected of you?

520
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:30,529
Now, you may not know.

521
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:34,600
You might not be aware what kind of organization you're in.

522
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,200
You might have some inkling of it.

523
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,661
And you may not have had a formal way to really think

524
00:24:38,741 --> 00:24:42,343
about how you're being treated in the organization and how

525
00:24:42,423 --> 00:24:44,484
your boss expects you to treat other people.

526
00:24:45,144 --> 00:24:47,065
But it's good to know the difference between these.

527
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:48,566
You probably know it innately.

528
00:24:49,106 --> 00:24:51,107
You probably have a lot of assumptions about it.

529
00:24:51,547 --> 00:24:53,428
But it's good to be able to put more of a

530
00:24:53,528 --> 00:24:54,528
formal focus on it.

531
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:58,609
So in organizational behavior with management,

532
00:24:59,329 --> 00:25:01,050
there's basically two kinds of management.

533
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,570
We have transactional management,

534
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,531
and we have transformational management.

535
00:25:04,911 --> 00:25:07,571
And often you'll see if you have...

536
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:11,112
I happen to be in kind of a matrix structure

537
00:25:11,192 --> 00:25:12,372
as far as my reporting goes.

538
00:25:12,432 --> 00:25:15,133
My boss is Randy Pitchford, the owner of the company,

539
00:25:15,713 --> 00:25:18,214
and then I have another person I report to

540
00:25:18,294 --> 00:25:20,814
who's in kind of a different part of the company,

541
00:25:21,195 --> 00:25:22,955
and they have completely different styles.

542
00:25:23,315 --> 00:25:24,395
And I have to shape...

543
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:28,160
the way I approach things differently

544
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,183
because I always want the best result for everyone.

545
00:25:30,643 --> 00:25:32,225
But you can't talk to somebody

546
00:25:32,305 --> 00:25:34,488
who has a transactional management style

547
00:25:35,129 --> 00:25:36,331
as if you're talking to somebody

548
00:25:36,351 --> 00:25:38,153
who has a transformational management style.

549
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:39,535
You're gonna hit a brick wall.

550
00:25:40,296 --> 00:25:40,476
So.

551
00:25:41,557 --> 00:25:46,159
Knowing how to shape both reporting up and then how to work with the people around you

552
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:48,240
to adapt your style is really important.

553
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:52,962
You need to add those tools to your toolbox and you need to practice it constantly.

554
00:25:53,422 --> 00:25:58,585
And one of the things you need to do is pick up on who responds best to what kind of feedback.

555
00:25:59,385 --> 00:26:03,327
And that goes for the people you're managing directly, up, down, across, everything.

556
00:26:06,825 --> 00:26:09,787
What I'd like you to do for yourselves and your evaluations

557
00:26:09,827 --> 00:26:11,528
of yourselves is provide examples

558
00:26:12,228 --> 00:26:14,709
about where you've needed to employ each of these.

559
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:18,632
And they should be very specific examples, not like,

560
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:23,775
you know, sometimes I have to go see somebody, you know,

561
00:26:24,495 --> 00:26:26,917
I have to go see so-and-so on the floor

562
00:26:27,637 --> 00:26:31,179
and tell them that they're going to get a bad review

563
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:32,480
if they don't get something done.

564
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,821
By the way, you should never do that anyway.

565
00:26:34,622 --> 00:26:34,942
You know, if...

566
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:39,477
That would be nice and, while that would be nice and specific,

567
00:26:40,177 --> 00:26:43,999
I want examples where, first of all, you think,

568
00:26:44,459 --> 00:26:46,500
in that case, you think you're keeping things moving,

569
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:50,121
but also that you're improving performance of people, right?

570
00:26:50,502 --> 00:26:51,982
So I want you to think about instances

571
00:26:52,042 --> 00:26:53,323
where you've employed these,

572
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:54,783
where you've needed to employ them,

573
00:26:55,004 --> 00:26:57,545
and the result was good for everybody.

574
00:27:01,506 --> 00:27:04,188
High performance means you're going fast.

575
00:27:05,573 --> 00:27:07,374
How many of us have heard of an OODA loop?

576
00:27:08,956 --> 00:27:09,316
A couple.

577
00:27:09,636 --> 00:27:10,357
OK, good.

578
00:27:10,477 --> 00:27:12,638
I'm glad that I'm introducing this to the majority of you.

579
00:27:14,523 --> 00:27:17,165
From one of your missions, I hope from this point forward

580
00:27:17,205 --> 00:27:19,207
is you're going to master this concept.

581
00:27:19,587 --> 00:27:23,030
It's not a particularly difficult concept to grok,

582
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,991
but it is difficult to master.

583
00:27:25,231 --> 00:27:26,652
One of the hardest things about it,

584
00:27:26,672 --> 00:27:29,815
and I have a few notes here where I'm going to touch on it,

585
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:32,997
is ensuring that you're constantly employing it,

586
00:27:33,077 --> 00:27:35,840
that you're being mindful and employing this process.

587
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,542
It will make you a superior producer

588
00:27:38,642 --> 00:27:40,443
and a superior person as well.

589
00:27:41,024 --> 00:27:47,045
So, if you want to be fast, okay, you need some framework to be fast within, because

590
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:51,386
you need to know how to match what you're seeing with what you've seen before, and remember

591
00:27:51,706 --> 00:27:54,587
how to act now that you're seeing the new thing.

592
00:27:55,367 --> 00:27:59,128
But what you also have to do is avoid some serious problems.

593
00:27:59,688 --> 00:28:01,149
I'll mention what those are.

594
00:28:02,712 --> 00:28:04,293
what the lingo is for those in a second.

595
00:28:04,854 --> 00:28:08,618
So, an OODA loop is observe, orient, decide, and act.

596
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:12,462
Observing is, each one of these things, by the way,

597
00:28:12,522 --> 00:28:14,744
while it's easy to say the word, is hard to do.

598
00:28:15,265 --> 00:28:16,926
Observing, we see things all the time.

599
00:28:17,928 --> 00:28:20,150
But as you know from the concept of flow,

600
00:28:20,751 --> 00:28:23,815
we know the idea of flow from Csikszentmihalyi.

601
00:28:23,875 --> 00:28:26,319
It's sort of like where you get lost in what you're doing,

602
00:28:26,379 --> 00:28:29,463
and you can daydream and get a thing done, or you're driving,

603
00:28:29,523 --> 00:28:31,585
and you forget that you're driving, but you get there.

604
00:28:32,787 --> 00:28:35,611
What's hard to do is be an active observer.

605
00:28:37,844 --> 00:28:40,407
Once you've noticed something in your environment,

606
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:42,270
what's even harder to do, though,

607
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,232
is to orient yourself to it.

608
00:28:44,613 --> 00:28:46,455
You might observe something and see something,

609
00:28:46,495 --> 00:28:48,437
but it doesn't occur to you that it's out of place

610
00:28:48,598 --> 00:28:50,640
or that you need to do something about it.

611
00:28:51,902 --> 00:28:55,744
So the will, the decision to do something about it

612
00:28:56,565 --> 00:28:59,346
is very hard, especially if you're in an organization

613
00:28:59,806 --> 00:29:03,908
where you feel like you might be punished for deciding to act

614
00:29:03,968 --> 00:29:06,569
where it's not part of somebody else's decision,

615
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,911
where you have to use your influence to do it.

616
00:29:09,991 --> 00:29:11,852
And the will to act can be the hardest thing.

617
00:29:12,913 --> 00:29:16,694
So you as producers, you need to stamp out that lazy inaction.

618
00:29:16,714 --> 00:29:18,515
I'm going to talk about inaction a few times.

619
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,681
The best way to do that, by the way,

620
00:29:21,701 --> 00:29:23,601
is with the positive, using the care,

621
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:28,343
which is to always reward people who are not afraid to act

622
00:29:28,523 --> 00:29:32,404
when they see something, and to especially do that

623
00:29:32,684 --> 00:29:34,024
if it's quick and smart.

624
00:29:34,404 --> 00:29:37,965
But if you see people who are moving fast to act on things,

625
00:29:39,886 --> 00:29:43,207
that is one of the, you know, if you are mentoring people

626
00:29:43,847 --> 00:29:46,068
and you see that they are willing to actually

627
00:29:46,308 --> 00:29:48,868
take the initiative to do something, reward them for it.

628
00:29:51,687 --> 00:29:52,248
Let's skip ahead.

629
00:29:53,489 --> 00:29:55,291
This is what it looks in the more formal cycle.

630
00:29:56,032 --> 00:29:57,674
You can go online and find this as well.

631
00:29:57,955 --> 00:29:59,917
I wanted to show it to you here, since this would be the

632
00:29:59,957 --> 00:30:01,839
first introduction for many of you.

633
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:06,504
The OODA loop is what got us through some asymmetric

634
00:30:06,544 --> 00:30:10,008
warfare that we had to get through when we went to Iraq

635
00:30:10,069 --> 00:30:11,370
for Operation Iraqi Freedom.

636
00:30:12,882 --> 00:30:15,163
We don't have time for that talk right now,

637
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:19,565
but when you approach a new situation in a new way

638
00:30:19,585 --> 00:30:21,886
and you need a new frame of reference to deal with it,

639
00:30:22,466 --> 00:30:25,348
you have to orient yourself to that new thing in a new way.

640
00:30:26,808 --> 00:30:28,769
This gives you a framework in which to do that.

641
00:30:29,489 --> 00:30:32,911
So that kind of orienteering, orientation,

642
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:36,653
is you take that new information,

643
00:30:36,813 --> 00:30:39,054
you apply it to some pattern you already know,

644
00:30:39,414 --> 00:30:41,215
then you intentionally break that pattern.

645
00:30:41,835 --> 00:30:44,637
You apply a new, you come up, you use your imagination

646
00:30:44,697 --> 00:30:47,720
to think of other reasons why that thing might be happening.

647
00:30:48,401 --> 00:30:51,783
Come up with a plan for how you would deal with each of those.

648
00:30:52,224 --> 00:30:54,145
Now you have a war game for how to approach it.

649
00:31:01,391 --> 00:31:05,595
You notice here, uh, in shelter constantly,

650
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:07,597
you've got, who's this?

651
00:31:09,758 --> 00:31:10,499
Do we not play shelter?

652
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:12,979
Yeah, the stranger.

653
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,180
He pops up.

654
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,881
You have to notice that he's there.

655
00:31:18,241 --> 00:31:22,683
When you have a big vault, he's pretty easy to miss.

656
00:31:24,564 --> 00:31:26,944
This OODA loop is basically what you're

657
00:31:27,024 --> 00:31:31,486
doing if you didn't have the sound that clued you

658
00:31:31,606 --> 00:31:32,386
in that he was there.

659
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:36,028
You always need to be doing this.

660
00:31:44,716 --> 00:31:48,120
To be a master producer, to be truly highly performant,

661
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,521
you've got to master this.

662
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:52,704
You've got to get used to noticing things

663
00:31:53,105 --> 00:31:54,706
that other people are not noticing.

664
00:31:55,752 --> 00:31:58,133
Now, when you come in in the morning and you see somebody

665
00:31:58,173 --> 00:32:01,033
who looks like they may be a little off that day,

666
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,174
make sure to stop by their desk.

667
00:32:03,794 --> 00:32:06,554
You noticed it, probably somebody else didn't notice it.

668
00:32:06,774 --> 00:32:08,615
Their immediate lead may not have noticed it.

669
00:32:08,755 --> 00:32:11,115
Pass on information to other people around you

670
00:32:11,255 --> 00:32:13,256
any time you notice something

671
00:32:13,296 --> 00:32:15,376
that may be slightly out of the ordinary.

672
00:32:15,996 --> 00:32:18,857
If you feel like it's been a day too long

673
00:32:19,057 --> 00:32:21,617
since some task was reported,

674
00:32:21,777 --> 00:32:24,018
well, I don't like to over-focus on tasks.

675
00:32:24,538 --> 00:32:26,999
You know, everything, you have to be the one

676
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,360
to catch all those details.

677
00:32:30,022 --> 00:32:31,903
It could be indicative of any number of things.

678
00:32:33,984 --> 00:32:36,026
It happens to be, this is very native to Agile.

679
00:32:37,086 --> 00:32:39,248
And you will run better meetings for Agile

680
00:32:40,468 --> 00:32:42,150
if you're employing this as part of it.

681
00:32:44,091 --> 00:32:46,493
Exploring what the possibilities are outside

682
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:49,575
of what the people who are in your scrum meetings

683
00:32:49,715 --> 00:32:51,196
and in your sprint planning sessions.

684
00:32:52,307 --> 00:32:53,107
I do this a lot.

685
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:56,327
Even when I know answers, or I feel I know the answers,

686
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:57,828
I still ask the questions.

687
00:32:58,408 --> 00:33:00,908
Because it gets people thinking, using their imagination

688
00:33:01,048 --> 00:33:03,589
outside of what they believe is already the answer,

689
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:06,630
outside of the solution that they already want to pursue.

690
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:11,991
And I try not to do it too often where people pick up on it

691
00:33:12,091 --> 00:33:15,632
and think that it's just a distraction.

692
00:33:16,072 --> 00:33:18,432
But any time you think, you should trust your gut.

693
00:33:18,512 --> 00:33:20,993
Any time you think that a solution is being pursued

694
00:33:21,313 --> 00:33:23,374
because it's maybe the easiest

695
00:33:23,894 --> 00:33:26,114
and isn't the one that's gonna work best for everyone,

696
00:33:26,454 --> 00:33:27,795
for the team, for others, for the people

697
00:33:27,815 --> 00:33:29,335
who are gonna pick up that code after,

698
00:33:29,735 --> 00:33:31,015
you need to do something about it.

699
00:33:31,035 --> 00:33:32,076
You have to have the will to act.

700
00:33:36,897 --> 00:33:38,217
You're not going to improve

701
00:33:38,437 --> 00:33:41,318
if you don't increase your self-awareness.

702
00:33:41,358 --> 00:33:41,958
And I say that...

703
00:33:43,185 --> 00:33:45,346
in that I am always trying to increase my self-awareness.

704
00:33:46,587 --> 00:33:48,828
I'm not making an assumption about where anybody is,

705
00:33:49,309 --> 00:33:51,730
but this is something that's a lifelong pursuit.

706
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:57,594
We have to pick up on, in ourselves,

707
00:33:57,834 --> 00:33:59,455
when we're being overly cynical,

708
00:34:00,416 --> 00:34:02,377
when we're steering away from pragmatism,

709
00:34:02,878 --> 00:34:05,619
when we're not using our executive function to task switch,

710
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,261
when we're getting too stuck on something.

711
00:34:10,138 --> 00:34:12,859
So it's important to take time if you could every morning,

712
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:14,300
every evening, whatever.

713
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,081
Think about are you doing this?

714
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:20,122
Evaluate yourself and how often you're trying to do

715
00:34:20,282 --> 00:34:21,683
directed things to improve yourselves.

716
00:34:22,223 --> 00:34:23,724
And then situational awareness,

717
00:34:24,344 --> 00:34:25,724
now going back to the OODA loop.

718
00:34:26,685 --> 00:34:28,507
You have to learn how to filter, right?

719
00:34:28,627 --> 00:34:30,288
So every room has a baseline.

720
00:34:30,328 --> 00:34:31,449
This room has a baseline.

721
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,531
You know, the hallway has a baseline.

722
00:34:33,751 --> 00:34:35,153
Your studio has a baseline.

723
00:34:35,393 --> 00:34:38,095
You have to notice anything that is perceptive

724
00:34:38,175 --> 00:34:40,637
outside of just that background noise.

725
00:34:41,882 --> 00:34:46,006
And normalcy bias is the thing that prevents us from acting

726
00:34:46,046 --> 00:34:47,427
when we see something really weird.

727
00:34:48,248 --> 00:34:51,471
Now, a lot of you might have already heard of normalcy bias.

728
00:34:51,511 --> 00:34:56,695
This is where, oh, I'm used to if I'm walking in London, I

729
00:34:57,336 --> 00:34:59,117
forget that cars come the wrong way.

730
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:03,161
Well, to me, I look the other way, I walk in the street,

731
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:04,222
boom, I'm hit by a car.

732
00:35:04,722 --> 00:35:07,024
Well, to me, it was normal that there were no cars coming

733
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:07,885
from the other direction.

734
00:35:10,257 --> 00:35:13,379
To me, it might be normal that I hear a couple of bangs

735
00:35:13,479 --> 00:35:15,900
outside in the parking lot or something, right?

736
00:35:16,241 --> 00:35:18,202
But I should still go look and see what it was.

737
00:35:21,944 --> 00:35:24,066
I hit on this one before around discerning and action.

738
00:35:24,446 --> 00:35:28,489
The best producers, and you need to notice for yourself,

739
00:35:29,549 --> 00:35:32,471
when something should happen and it doesn't,

740
00:35:32,971 --> 00:35:34,432
and it kind of itches at you,

741
00:35:34,673 --> 00:35:36,614
you have to immediately follow up on this.

742
00:35:37,622 --> 00:35:39,944
So if you want to increase the speed of your teams

743
00:35:40,184 --> 00:35:43,827
and of what you're doing, notice that things aren't happening

744
00:35:44,107 --> 00:35:46,209
that should be happening, and don't accept

745
00:35:46,349 --> 00:35:47,170
that they're not happening.

746
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:49,712
Don't accept that the meeting didn't happen,

747
00:35:49,992 --> 00:35:50,933
that was supposed to happen.

748
00:35:51,373 --> 00:35:54,215
Don't accept that the asset that was supposed to be in last week

749
00:35:54,275 --> 00:35:54,996
isn't in this week.

750
00:35:55,476 --> 00:35:56,617
You can't accept those things.

751
00:35:57,018 --> 00:36:01,381
You have to seek out the reasons and be a conduit

752
00:36:01,582 --> 00:36:02,963
or be an agent of change for those.

753
00:36:07,567 --> 00:36:12,372
Inaction as a decision is important to think about

754
00:36:12,572 --> 00:36:13,473
for high performance.

755
00:36:14,934 --> 00:36:18,537
So, have you ever talked about inaction

756
00:36:18,577 --> 00:36:19,298
with a member of your team?

757
00:36:19,318 --> 00:36:20,499
The fact that they didn't do something.

758
00:36:20,539 --> 00:36:23,542
It's so easy for us to talk about wrong things people did

759
00:36:23,602 --> 00:36:26,644
or that we feel they did, but it's so difficult

760
00:36:26,825 --> 00:36:28,606
for us to a lot of times even notice

761
00:36:28,646 --> 00:36:30,288
that they didn't do something they should have.

762
00:36:37,868 --> 00:36:40,951
This, I think, is a pretty good one, especially because it's John O'Cleese.

763
00:36:42,852 --> 00:36:47,796
It's on the same basic topic, and just going to the bold part there,

764
00:36:48,236 --> 00:36:50,418
that most people who have absolutely no idea what they're doing

765
00:36:50,678 --> 00:36:53,320
have absolutely no idea that they have no idea what they're doing.

766
00:36:56,282 --> 00:36:59,685
If you're just starting out as a new producer in the industry,

767
00:37:01,526 --> 00:37:02,147
you might not...

768
00:37:02,981 --> 00:37:06,064
Be at all aware of the habits that you're developing

769
00:37:06,084 --> 00:37:08,107
that are affecting other people around you.

770
00:37:08,748 --> 00:37:10,810
You might not be realizing which habits

771
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:11,852
you're even picking up on.

772
00:37:13,133 --> 00:37:15,836
One of the reasons I like bringing new junior people

773
00:37:15,917 --> 00:37:18,299
into Gearbox is because we can more shape them,

774
00:37:19,161 --> 00:37:21,363
having developed all those bad habits somewhere else.

775
00:37:22,084 --> 00:37:24,706
But we also have to be mindful of what people are picking up

776
00:37:24,846 --> 00:37:28,770
on from us, especially if you've been around a while,

777
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,472
you shortcut to a lot of things.

778
00:37:31,732 --> 00:37:33,674
It's not obvious to the people around you

779
00:37:33,734 --> 00:37:35,175
why you're doing what you do.

780
00:37:35,635 --> 00:37:38,237
Sometimes you have to stop and take someone, especially

781
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:41,900
junior person aside, and explain to them what they're seeing.

782
00:37:48,246 --> 00:37:50,407
And a way to know that you don't know.

783
00:37:51,348 --> 00:37:52,729
is that you're getting surprised a lot.

784
00:37:56,812 --> 00:37:59,413
So think about, when is it that you're getting surprised?

785
00:38:01,674 --> 00:38:03,435
I won't linger on this too much right now.

786
00:38:06,397 --> 00:38:08,258
But I want you to actually think about this.

787
00:38:08,999 --> 00:38:10,820
Take stock of, write down notes.

788
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:13,101
Here's the last few times I was surprised

789
00:38:13,201 --> 00:38:14,482
because of something that happened.

790
00:38:15,475 --> 00:38:18,337
Other people might notice that you're getting screwed real often.

791
00:38:18,677 --> 00:38:23,400
There are some cases where I've had to pull people aside in my organization and say,

792
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,403
hey, it's like three times now that you got surprised that so-and-so didn't show up,

793
00:38:28,623 --> 00:38:33,226
or that seems like you're having a hard time getting out of the door,

794
00:38:33,266 --> 00:38:34,907
well, you missed that meeting that didn't get

795
00:38:34,947 --> 00:38:37,228
called because they just assumed you'd be here for core hours.

796
00:38:37,829 --> 00:38:39,270
There are a lot of things like that.

797
00:38:40,931 --> 00:38:42,372
as well as technical things,

798
00:38:43,033 --> 00:38:45,575
that if you find this happening a lot,

799
00:38:45,755 --> 00:38:49,238
it's probably you filling in those dark areas of the picture

800
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:51,500
that you didn't know were there before.

801
00:38:55,883 --> 00:38:58,966
These are pretty straightforward, okay?

802
00:38:59,786 --> 00:39:01,768
The detail is so important in game development.

803
00:39:02,629 --> 00:39:04,910
So, you know, these are going to be,

804
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,432
I'm going to skip ahead to the next one,

805
00:39:06,472 --> 00:39:07,913
but you're going to see these reflected

806
00:39:07,973 --> 00:39:09,935
in this kind of report card structure that we have.

807
00:39:16,889 --> 00:39:18,912
If you get the chance, mentor as often as you can.

808
00:39:19,874 --> 00:39:20,715
It makes you better.

809
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:23,440
It builds trust with the people around you.

810
00:39:24,522 --> 00:39:26,004
It helps you check your assumptions,

811
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:27,968
and you get to answer a lot of good questions.

812
00:39:29,288 --> 00:39:34,769
You should, if you don't already have mentoring as a formal thing in your company,

813
00:39:35,069 --> 00:39:38,550
and I'll have to admit at Gearbox, we really don't have it in a formal way.

814
00:39:38,931 --> 00:39:41,771
Though I do encourage it, and many of us encourage it.

815
00:39:42,732 --> 00:39:47,273
And we try to connect, as you would, any time you're in organizational management,

816
00:39:47,293 --> 00:39:50,734
you're gonna connect with senior and junior people so that sharing can happen.

817
00:39:51,074 --> 00:39:53,735
But any opportunity you have for it, you should engage in it.

818
00:39:57,753 --> 00:39:59,334
Grade yourself for how well you think you did

819
00:39:59,374 --> 00:40:00,055
when you were mentoring.

820
00:40:02,156 --> 00:40:04,698
And write down any specific measures you can imagine.

821
00:40:05,019 --> 00:40:06,600
These are the same measures that you use

822
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,541
in your end of year reviews

823
00:40:07,601 --> 00:40:08,722
or any other performance review.

824
00:40:11,564 --> 00:40:14,006
One thing that we might not do because we're afraid to

825
00:40:14,506 --> 00:40:18,329
is ask the person who mentored you how they think you did.

826
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:21,092
A lot of times we're nervous to do it,

827
00:40:21,192 --> 00:40:22,393
they're much more senior than we are,

828
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:23,253
we don't do it, we should.

829
00:40:25,782 --> 00:40:28,343
And you can only get better if you do it frequently enough

830
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:31,165
that the memory of the lesson lingers with you.

831
00:40:38,829 --> 00:40:41,770
If there's one athlete that's better than LeBron James right

832
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:45,912
now, it might be American, although American Pharaoh

833
00:40:45,932 --> 00:40:49,734
hasn't raced in, what, a year and a half or so now.

834
00:40:51,135 --> 00:40:53,976
Strong mentorship is like a great gene pool, OK?

835
00:40:54,656 --> 00:40:54,876
So.

836
00:40:57,081 --> 00:41:06,926
American Pharaoh's siring, you know, very high dollar rental fees, as well as American

837
00:41:06,966 --> 00:41:11,349
Pharaoh's dad actually is doing even better for the owner.

838
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:17,792
But if you want to have a really strong structure of trust and to be able to go fast in your

839
00:41:17,832 --> 00:41:19,573
organization, mentor a lot.

840
00:41:22,475 --> 00:41:24,236
Also if you want to go fast, you're learning lessons.

841
00:41:25,076 --> 00:41:26,277
Now this talk's not on.

842
00:41:27,706 --> 00:41:29,407
post-mortems and after-action reviews.

843
00:41:30,308 --> 00:41:33,291
So if there's a different talk you can go to

844
00:41:33,671 --> 00:41:36,133
on post-mortems and after-action reviews, please do it.

845
00:41:36,493 --> 00:41:38,075
And there's a lot of literature online.

846
00:41:38,335 --> 00:41:42,359
How many of you have engaged in formal post-mortems before?

847
00:41:43,545 --> 00:41:45,827
OK, a lot of you, awesome.

848
00:41:46,147 --> 00:41:47,948
They tend to vary in terms of quality,

849
00:41:48,728 --> 00:41:51,589
and they don't always have actionable results.

850
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,791
And that's the only thing I really care about

851
00:41:53,831 --> 00:41:56,572
with postmortems is were there actionable results or not.

852
00:41:56,852 --> 00:41:58,133
I don't just want to see everybody

853
00:41:58,173 --> 00:42:00,394
and get around and have a cathartic moment where we all

854
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:02,035
complain about what happened on the project.

855
00:42:02,275 --> 00:42:03,676
Well, that can be fun over beers,

856
00:42:03,716 --> 00:42:05,216
and so we can call that a postmortem.

857
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:06,397
That's not a postmortem.

858
00:42:07,459 --> 00:42:13,492
It's not a postmortem unless people have actually learned and you've put in measurable outcomes,

859
00:42:14,313 --> 00:42:15,877
an action plan that can be followed.

860
00:42:19,222 --> 00:42:20,823
Again, these slides will be up for you.

861
00:42:20,863 --> 00:42:23,865
This is the after action review process

862
00:42:23,945 --> 00:42:25,465
as applied to post-mortems.

863
00:42:26,666 --> 00:42:29,287
And it walks you through a lot of what you already know there.

864
00:42:29,507 --> 00:42:33,389
But again, you have to have these measurable outcomes.

865
00:42:33,409 --> 00:42:34,830
You have to know how you're going to measure them.

866
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:36,731
And you can practice them.

867
00:42:36,751 --> 00:42:38,352
You don't have to wait till the end of a project.

868
00:42:38,372 --> 00:42:40,773
So that's why I like experiments.

869
00:42:40,873 --> 00:42:43,634
And it's why I like doing what we call mid-mortems.

870
00:42:43,854 --> 00:42:45,795
But you can do an after action review at any time.

871
00:42:49,743 --> 00:42:50,743
and then go the next step.

872
00:42:52,043 --> 00:42:55,144
Invent things where you can have post mortems.

873
00:42:56,905 --> 00:43:00,125
And do it in ways where they're fun and hard.

874
00:43:01,846 --> 00:43:04,166
That helps you battle complacency with the team, right?

875
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,167
It's easy to get in the rut.

876
00:43:05,187 --> 00:43:06,767
You got a lot to do on a project.

877
00:43:07,207 --> 00:43:09,148
Come up with stuff that can be measured

878
00:43:09,868 --> 00:43:12,348
that isn't necessarily obvious to you already.

879
00:43:15,114 --> 00:43:18,196
And in terms of speed, when you do those things,

880
00:43:18,576 --> 00:43:20,537
and it doesn't have to be something new that you made up,

881
00:43:20,577 --> 00:43:22,578
I mean, you can do this with some activity

882
00:43:22,618 --> 00:43:24,039
you're already employing on your project.

883
00:43:24,439 --> 00:43:25,880
Practice increasing the tempo.

884
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,701
Don't give everybody as much time

885
00:43:27,741 --> 00:43:28,541
as they would usually have.

886
00:43:29,162 --> 00:43:31,483
Cut in half, cut in two thirds.

887
00:43:31,883 --> 00:43:33,784
Make it a less risky thing so they know

888
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:35,745
that this isn't what's gonna get their neck chopped

889
00:43:35,785 --> 00:43:37,226
if they don't get it done in time, okay?

890
00:43:37,847 --> 00:43:39,527
But get people practicing.

891
00:43:39,547 --> 00:43:41,328
This is just like speed modeling for artists.

892
00:43:41,669 --> 00:43:44,630
Get them practicing moving faster in less risky ways.

893
00:43:49,103 --> 00:43:50,423
I love talking about Musashi.

894
00:43:50,644 --> 00:43:52,164
The only thing I'm gonna point out here

895
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:55,606
from Go Rendo Show, which is a book of five rings,

896
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:58,087
is this one of know the ways of all professions.

897
00:43:58,127 --> 00:44:00,948
So cross-training is so important.

898
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:04,750
If you wanna be a great producer who's fast,

899
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:06,951
you want to understand everything you're hearing.

900
00:44:06,971 --> 00:44:11,613
And when I talked about separating out from the noise,

901
00:44:11,874 --> 00:44:13,574
separating it out signal from the noise,

902
00:44:14,135 --> 00:44:16,916
one of the best ways to do it is to increase your knowledge

903
00:44:17,136 --> 00:44:18,197
of what other people do.

904
00:44:22,569 --> 00:44:28,373
I'm going to go through a couple of analyses that I did with some software a friend of

905
00:44:28,453 --> 00:44:30,375
mine is building.

906
00:44:30,475 --> 00:44:34,017
This is not a pitch, but there's no cost to this, so I'm not pitching a software.

907
00:44:34,298 --> 00:44:36,319
You can go do this as soon as this is over if you want.

908
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:39,581
It's called Skills Engine, and he's

909
00:44:39,641 --> 00:44:44,443
building a machine learning platform for skills analysis

910
00:44:45,324 --> 00:44:48,685
for things like job postings and helping schools

911
00:44:48,745 --> 00:44:51,446
develop curriculum that gets people jobs as soon as they get

912
00:44:51,526 --> 00:44:54,368
out, because they're very targeted to what people need

913
00:44:54,408 --> 00:44:56,029
to know to do their jobs.

914
00:44:56,329 --> 00:44:58,530
And you can put a resume in here and see what you get.

915
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:00,311
I'd love to get feedback, by the way,

916
00:45:00,571 --> 00:45:03,452
if you do that with job postings from your companies.

917
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:09,653
Now, we don't have time for me to go in detail over all these.

918
00:45:10,293 --> 00:45:12,095
So I'm just going to kind of point out some high level

919
00:45:12,135 --> 00:45:12,375
things.

920
00:45:12,955 --> 00:45:17,739
First of all, all of these, I pulled in job descriptions

921
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:22,643
from some of those different jobs we talked about earlier.

922
00:45:22,743 --> 00:45:25,585
Development director, development manager, producer.

923
00:45:25,605 --> 00:45:28,167
I have an EP posting in here as well.

924
00:45:29,168 --> 00:45:32,490
And they all tend to focus around the same basic skills,

925
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,272
some of which we don't measure in ourselves that often,

926
00:45:35,352 --> 00:45:37,393
which really did catch my attention.

927
00:45:38,774 --> 00:45:42,316
And they only vary in terms of the skill you need to use very

928
00:45:42,436 --> 00:45:45,158
slightly when you go to the executive producer domain,

929
00:45:45,178 --> 00:45:48,460
where you're dealing more with budgets and P&L and product

930
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,961
lifecycle, as opposed to project lifecycle for

931
00:45:51,021 --> 00:45:51,421
producers.

932
00:45:52,729 --> 00:45:56,970
But we can, I pulled some things out of here to tell you

933
00:45:57,671 --> 00:46:01,972
how I built the categories for this report card

934
00:46:02,012 --> 00:46:02,952
you're gonna see in a second.

935
00:46:03,613 --> 00:46:06,134
All right.

936
00:46:06,534 --> 00:46:09,435
If I look at the top things, so if I go back one.

937
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:13,636
If you look at the top knowledge areas for this one,

938
00:46:13,676 --> 00:46:18,458
which is Treyark AP, okay.

939
00:46:19,598 --> 00:46:20,598
This gets grouped.

940
00:46:23,393 --> 00:46:24,718
I'm going to skip that.

941
00:46:24,858 --> 00:46:26,202
But these were all activists.

942
00:46:26,263 --> 00:46:27,527
Sledgehammer, B Knox.

943
00:46:28,982 --> 00:46:30,082
skip ahead and I'll show you,

944
00:46:31,282 --> 00:46:33,083
even though these are all AP roles,

945
00:46:34,723 --> 00:46:36,704
the way that they were correlated

946
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:39,344
to other industries and other jobs

947
00:46:39,885 --> 00:46:42,585
were all a bit different, right?

948
00:46:43,165 --> 00:46:45,026
Which also tells me all of you, again,

949
00:46:45,106 --> 00:46:48,487
need to understand the context of the job that you're doing

950
00:46:48,507 --> 00:46:49,947
because it's always gonna be a little different.

951
00:46:50,047 --> 00:46:51,948
Even in a big organization like that,

952
00:46:52,288 --> 00:46:54,508
that you would think have standardized roles more,

953
00:46:54,889 --> 00:46:56,749
it's not as standardized as I would think.

954
00:46:58,969 --> 00:47:01,011
One is very art heavy and creative.

955
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:04,494
How are you going to evaluate yourself

956
00:47:04,674 --> 00:47:07,978
in being able to talk through art issues

957
00:47:08,398 --> 00:47:12,342
and having requirements of you being more aware

958
00:47:12,382 --> 00:47:14,505
of what's happening on the creative things in the industry.

959
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:15,886
One is much more technical.

960
00:47:16,987 --> 00:47:19,270
One is more general management oriented.

961
00:47:20,887 --> 00:47:24,189
And here is the, which is funny by the way,

962
00:47:24,229 --> 00:47:25,769
dev director and dev manager turned out

963
00:47:25,789 --> 00:47:27,830
to be exactly the same except for years of experience,

964
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:30,491
which even coming from EA didn't know that.

965
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:39,355
This one turned on its head a little bit,

966
00:47:40,555 --> 00:47:45,117
critical thinking over things like information gathering,

967
00:47:45,897 --> 00:47:48,498
which should be, I think probably should be obvious.

968
00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:53,571
But since there's so many EPs who work their ways up from APs,

969
00:47:55,532 --> 00:47:58,453
needing to notice those things that are missing

970
00:47:59,833 --> 00:48:02,414
becomes so much more important when you get to the EP level.

971
00:48:03,815 --> 00:48:05,435
Noticing the things that aren't there,

972
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:09,537
because you have to be the ones to construct the ways

973
00:48:09,557 --> 00:48:11,117
that other people are doing their work

974
00:48:12,198 --> 00:48:13,838
and what the goals are for the project.

975
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:17,960
Skipped ahead.

976
00:48:20,269 --> 00:48:24,473
Sales and marketing was one of the top four hits for EP.

977
00:48:26,414 --> 00:48:27,095
You have to pitch.

978
00:48:27,155 --> 00:48:28,636
You have to understand the sales cycle.

979
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:29,977
You have to understand finance.

980
00:48:40,185 --> 00:48:40,806
That was for EP.

981
00:48:40,986 --> 00:48:41,266
OK.

982
00:48:42,287 --> 00:48:42,467
It's 2.10.

983
00:48:43,328 --> 00:48:44,629
I want to get you guys out of here on time.

984
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:48,612
So I took all that information.

985
00:48:50,415 --> 00:48:51,909
and put it into this table.

986
00:48:53,103 --> 00:48:57,845
And my thinking here is, when you're writing down your notes

987
00:48:58,485 --> 00:49:02,386
for your examples of when you yourself have exhibited

988
00:49:02,466 --> 00:49:05,966
something from what we've just seen,

989
00:49:06,186 --> 00:49:09,907
what's just been presented, write down those instances.

990
00:49:10,287 --> 00:49:11,048
Keep notes of these.

991
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:14,828
And if you do it periodically, if you do it in a way

992
00:49:14,948 --> 00:49:18,269
like you're running your Agile teams, you can now track this.

993
00:49:18,409 --> 00:49:20,690
You can track the data just like you would your sprints

994
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:22,350
or your milestones.

995
00:49:23,171 --> 00:49:28,015
and then jot down how many instances would you expect

996
00:49:28,075 --> 00:49:29,936
of yourself in the number of years you've been

997
00:49:29,976 --> 00:49:32,438
in the industry, in your role, in the job you have?

998
00:49:33,339 --> 00:49:35,761
How often do you think you should be exhibiting that?

999
00:49:35,801 --> 00:49:38,103
So for example, if you're responsible for P&L

1000
00:49:38,163 --> 00:49:40,325
and know you're gonna have a budget meeting once a month.

1001
00:49:40,705 --> 00:49:44,431
and you can really kick butt and having all your numbers together and be able to explain

1002
00:49:44,511 --> 00:49:48,578
how well the team's doing, that's, you know, basically once a quarter you're going to be

1003
00:49:48,638 --> 00:49:53,626
expected to have a great instance for that topic, right?

1004
00:49:54,006 --> 00:49:55,088
Think about it for yourself.

1005
00:49:56,660 --> 00:50:01,906
And I hope that you can build your own customized report card

1006
00:50:02,126 --> 00:50:02,607
out of this.

1007
00:50:03,308 --> 00:50:05,490
If you have any questions, you want

1008
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:09,314
to talk further on any of these topics, any of them are great.

1009
00:50:09,455 --> 00:50:10,836
Please get in touch with me.

1010
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:12,318
Talk amongst yourselves.

1011
00:50:12,898 --> 00:50:15,241
And next year, I want to hear if you've employed this

1012
00:50:15,421 --> 00:50:16,262
and if it's helped you at all.

1013
00:50:16,482 --> 00:50:16,743
Thank you.

1014
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:28,358
We do have nine minutes if anybody wants to ask questions.

1015
00:50:31,138 --> 00:50:31,699
Otherwise.

1016
00:50:33,699 --> 00:50:34,359
OK, we got one.

1017
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,001
Oh, and please don't forget the reviews.

1018
00:50:41,321 --> 00:50:47,323
Shoot alright, so Gearbox has a great reputation for your internship programs

1019
00:50:48,203 --> 00:50:49,963
and I wanted you to talk a little bit about.

1020
00:50:50,599 --> 00:50:51,820
What you mentioned is the carrot.

1021
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,740
What type of reward do you implement,

1022
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:55,361
both for your core team members

1023
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:58,542
and for those more temporary team members?

1024
00:50:59,703 --> 00:50:59,943
Sure.

1025
00:51:00,763 --> 00:51:03,865
So we've had a program since before I was at Gearbox

1026
00:51:03,905 --> 00:51:05,965
called the COGS program, Contractors at Gearbox,

1027
00:51:06,025 --> 00:51:09,807
which is our formal internship program.

1028
00:51:10,873 --> 00:51:15,878
And we give, when we run that program, it's not constant.

1029
00:51:16,238 --> 00:51:18,760
We run it quite frequently and across different disciplines.

1030
00:51:20,362 --> 00:51:20,943
We have...

1031
00:51:23,229 --> 00:51:26,132
you know, basically interns come in and work on our games,

1032
00:51:26,613 --> 00:51:29,296
typically in some area that's fairly safe.

1033
00:51:29,396 --> 00:51:30,377
Like I talked earlier,

1034
00:51:30,417 --> 00:51:33,100
if you want to do kind of rehearsals in areas

1035
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,422
and try things out, you do it in a safer way.

1036
00:51:36,443 --> 00:51:39,687
So we tend to have interns come in and work in teams

1037
00:51:39,747 --> 00:51:41,188
where they're paired up with a mentor.

1038
00:51:45,354 --> 00:51:51,919
it might be sometimes to try out some new concept that we wouldn't have the time to do otherwise.

1039
00:51:53,180 --> 00:52:03,849
Very frequently those interns are hired full time and do fantastic work where actually they are executing on R&D things that they were doing.

1040
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:09,493
So for the intern it's pretty much the opportunity is the carrot. What about for the core team members?

1041
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:14,278
Well, for the core team, it depends on what you mean when

1042
00:52:14,318 --> 00:52:15,841
we do the internships or just generally?

1043
00:52:16,162 --> 00:52:18,989
No, for your full-time team members, your leads, your

1044
00:52:20,285 --> 00:52:25,248
Sure, well I mean that's okay so it's a little out of the domain of the topic but I'll

1045
00:52:26,008 --> 00:52:28,869
I mean I don't know if you want I don't know if everybody wants me to give them

1046
00:52:28,889 --> 00:52:34,472
like the gearbox pitch or something like there are what I'll say is it's

1047
00:52:34,552 --> 00:52:39,915
important you know the people who own the studio came from the trenches as

1048
00:52:39,955 --> 00:52:42,676
developers and worked their way up so they always wanted to be fair to

1049
00:52:42,876 --> 00:52:45,217
everybody else who's in the studio so it's really important

1050
00:52:45,777 --> 00:52:50,178
to them and to us who are in the executive leadership

1051
00:52:50,338 --> 00:52:53,499
in the company, that everyone in the studio

1052
00:52:53,539 --> 00:52:54,619
be rewarded for the work.

1053
00:52:54,699 --> 00:52:57,280
So they all, you know, everybody in the company

1054
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,420
is full time, sees back end, and it's in a very

1055
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:01,781
fair and flat kind of way.

1056
00:53:01,901 --> 00:53:03,001
Well, it's in a very fair way.

1057
00:53:03,021 --> 00:53:04,501
It's in a calculated way.

1058
00:53:05,481 --> 00:53:05,801
Thank you.

1059
00:53:06,121 --> 00:53:06,302
Sure.

1060
00:53:08,222 --> 00:53:11,543
Does anybody who happens to be from Gearbox

1061
00:53:11,583 --> 00:53:13,063
have anything else they want me to add to that?

1062
00:53:14,143 --> 00:53:14,983
Or did that sound okay?

1063
00:53:15,993 --> 00:53:16,293
All right.

1064
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:17,834
Yeah, next question.

1065
00:53:18,175 --> 00:53:18,595
Oh, wait, hold on.

1066
00:53:18,615 --> 00:53:19,255
We've got one on this side.

1067
00:53:19,295 --> 00:53:19,456
Yeah.

1068
00:53:19,776 --> 00:53:20,737
OK.

1069
00:53:21,917 --> 00:53:24,740
You mentioned something about people having initiative and

1070
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:28,062
working on things that, you know, what if those

1071
00:53:28,102 --> 00:53:32,085
initiatives aren't on the, like, from the backlog and

1072
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:33,326
not from the sprint and stuff like that?

1073
00:53:33,486 --> 00:53:35,508
Like, they did something that wasn't supposed to be done at

1074
00:53:35,548 --> 00:53:35,908
the moment.

1075
00:53:36,008 --> 00:53:37,169
How would you handle that situation?

1076
00:53:37,629 --> 00:53:37,829
Yeah.

1077
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:40,231
So as long as, well, let me answer that one first.

1078
00:53:40,251 --> 00:53:41,672
And then that's OK if it's like a two part.

1079
00:53:43,364 --> 00:53:47,127
So if people do things that aren't specifically assigned

1080
00:53:47,147 --> 00:53:50,009
to them in the sprint, if they get the sprint done, no problem.

1081
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:54,132
The assumption is if they're going to do that,

1082
00:53:54,292 --> 00:53:56,573
then they are going to get their work done

1083
00:53:56,613 --> 00:53:58,094
that they've committed to in the sprint.

1084
00:53:59,315 --> 00:54:01,057
And then if they want to do something beyond that,

1085
00:54:01,737 --> 00:54:02,938
we'll totally support them.

1086
00:54:03,258 --> 00:54:05,780
I have people who have had ideas to do different things,

1087
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,661
and I've told them to go for it.

1088
00:54:08,142 --> 00:54:10,983
I'm talking about a situation in which they didn't meet

1089
00:54:12,902 --> 00:54:16,804
Oh, well, I mean, you know, it's between them and their lead.

1090
00:54:16,824 --> 00:54:18,144
Okay.

1091
00:54:18,225 --> 00:54:18,505
Right?

1092
00:54:18,525 --> 00:54:26,089
So, I've never, I can't think of a time that a lead was surprised in a situation like that.

1093
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:34,373
And I also can't think of a time when somebody didn't get something done but was spending

1094
00:54:34,413 --> 00:54:35,754
their time on some other thing.

1095
00:54:36,194 --> 00:54:40,156
So, that I don't think has really come up yet.

1096
00:54:42,603 --> 00:54:46,927
But I would expect that everybody be comfortable just talking with their lead

1097
00:54:46,967 --> 00:54:51,472
about how to basically negotiate their time on that thing.

1098
00:54:51,972 --> 00:54:55,395
The baseline is they're gonna get done whatever it was that they'd committed to.

1099
00:54:56,036 --> 00:54:59,459
And the other one is, in a perfect world,

1100
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:05,786
do you think producers would be phased out if everyone is self-sufficient or

1101
00:55:05,806 --> 00:55:06,226
something like that?

1102
00:55:07,832 --> 00:55:09,333
would you still need producers?

1103
00:55:09,713 --> 00:55:11,174
Let me just rephrase to make sure I understand.

1104
00:55:11,874 --> 00:55:13,555
I think you asked, in a perfect world,

1105
00:55:13,675 --> 00:55:15,396
would all producers be self-sufficient?

1106
00:55:15,576 --> 00:55:15,756
No.

1107
00:55:15,976 --> 00:55:18,598
If all team members are self-sufficient,

1108
00:55:18,618 --> 00:55:19,598
would all producers?

1109
00:55:19,658 --> 00:55:20,819
And don't need producers?

1110
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,261
See, I think actually that's a interesting question.

1111
00:55:26,742 --> 00:55:29,703
I think it's a fallacy, because the best producers are

1112
00:55:31,232 --> 00:55:32,573
not observed that often.

1113
00:55:34,195 --> 00:55:37,397
I think the best producers create a flywheel effect,

1114
00:55:38,018 --> 00:55:39,559
and that flywheel doesn't slow down.

1115
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:43,022
And they're there to protect the flywheel.

1116
00:55:43,042 --> 00:55:48,146
And once it's going fast, and you've built the organization,

1117
00:55:48,166 --> 00:55:49,708
and have the right people in place, and process,

1118
00:55:49,728 --> 00:55:52,770
and all those things, your job is to care for it.

1119
00:55:53,051 --> 00:55:54,532
And then you can turn your attention

1120
00:55:54,592 --> 00:55:57,514
to other things that aren't as observable to people

1121
00:55:57,554 --> 00:55:58,175
within the team.

1122
00:55:58,755 --> 00:55:59,056
Thank you.

1123
00:55:59,276 --> 00:55:59,416
Sure.

1124
00:56:01,544 --> 00:56:07,486
So how do you feel about the frequency of reviews that you conduct, be it one-on-ones,

1125
00:56:07,586 --> 00:56:12,027
biweekly with artists, or doing yearly reviews and sitting down and doing goal settings?

1126
00:56:12,547 --> 00:56:16,109
How do you feel about a good frequency for doing those?

1127
00:56:16,189 --> 00:56:19,970
Is there some subtext in there having to do with the frequency of how often you have reviews?

1128
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:21,110
No, just curiosity.

1129
00:56:25,202 --> 00:56:26,143
That's a good question.

1130
00:56:26,323 --> 00:56:27,103
It's a hard one.

1131
00:56:27,123 --> 00:56:30,844
I mean, not everybody's Lisa Simpson and wants to review

1132
00:56:30,864 --> 00:56:33,404
like every day and know exactly what grade she got in

1133
00:56:33,444 --> 00:56:35,365
every class.

1134
00:56:37,865 --> 00:56:41,746
We try to be good about having an informal review process,

1135
00:56:41,786 --> 00:56:44,307
just making it very clear where everybody stands at any

1136
00:56:44,347 --> 00:56:44,987
given time.

1137
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:46,347
With that said.

1138
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:52,293
With that said, I wish that we were doing reviews more often.

1139
00:56:52,313 --> 00:56:55,696
You know, we have once a year performance reviews.

1140
00:56:57,918 --> 00:57:01,200
And on occasion, we also do 360 reviews,

1141
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,442
which we haven't done in a little while.

1142
00:57:03,482 --> 00:57:04,623
We need to get back to it.

1143
00:57:06,845 --> 00:57:08,927
It has to do with kind of democratization.

1144
00:57:08,947 --> 00:57:11,629
And when you have a

1145
00:57:12,754 --> 00:57:15,436
a social organization that's intended to be a meritocracy.

1146
00:57:15,476 --> 00:57:17,999
You want people to understand, you know,

1147
00:57:18,279 --> 00:57:20,461
where they fit amongst their peer group

1148
00:57:20,641 --> 00:57:22,723
and if are they earning the merit

1149
00:57:22,784 --> 00:57:24,145
of being there with their peer group.

1150
00:57:24,685 --> 00:57:28,089
And that if you don't get that kind of feedback very often,

1151
00:57:28,149 --> 00:57:29,810
there's really no way for you to know.

1152
00:57:31,152 --> 00:57:33,814
And there's in fact dangers of having a culture like that

1153
00:57:33,895 --> 00:57:34,475
if you're not.

1154
00:57:35,776 --> 00:57:37,977
providing reviews fairly often.

1155
00:57:38,438 --> 00:57:41,219
So we encourage our leads to ensure that they are

1156
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:43,521
interacting with the people they work with,

1157
00:57:43,701 --> 00:57:44,982
so that's always very clear.

1158
00:57:47,383 --> 00:57:49,624
But you have to balance it, right?

1159
00:57:49,644 --> 00:57:52,866
I mean, you have to balance it with a formal review process

1160
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:56,508
versus informal, because it can be a distraction

1161
00:57:56,608 --> 00:57:58,390
and it takes a lot to gear it up.

1162
00:58:00,266 --> 00:58:04,748
So I don't think it's optimal today,

1163
00:58:07,669 --> 00:58:11,610
but at the same time, it's provided, I think,

1164
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:15,631
decent conversations for us to make it clear

1165
00:58:16,111 --> 00:58:16,832
where everybody is.

1166
00:58:16,872 --> 00:58:20,773
And again, they get that touch point from their leads,

1167
00:58:21,553 --> 00:58:22,894
as often as the lead does it.

1168
00:58:22,994 --> 00:58:25,255
So really, it comes down to making sure

1169
00:58:25,315 --> 00:58:26,595
leads are doing it more often.

1170
00:58:27,996 --> 00:58:28,196
Thank you.

1171
00:58:28,556 --> 00:58:28,716
Sure.

1172
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:34,903
What qualities are good mentors looking for in good mentees?

1173
00:58:36,925 --> 00:58:37,726
Oh, that's a good question.

1174
00:58:41,749 --> 00:58:46,433
Open-minded, fast learners who can develop technical skill quickly if they need to.

1175
00:58:48,014 --> 00:58:50,216
I had a five-minute warning before. Am I out?

1176
00:58:51,417 --> 00:58:55,100
Okay. I know we have a couple more questions.

1177
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:58,663
If it's okay, I want to answer your questions, but can I do it off the stage?

1178
00:58:59,732 --> 00:59:01,064
Is that alright for both of you?

1179
00:59:01,185 --> 00:59:02,254
Cool. Alright, thank you guys.
