1
00:00:06,476 --> 00:00:07,677
Hi, everybody.

2
00:00:08,498 --> 00:00:09,298
Thanks for being here.

3
00:00:10,059 --> 00:00:10,940
My name is Floor Marti.

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,243
I'm the producer of the Deus Ex live team at Eidos Montreal.

5
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:19,286
And today I'll be talking to you about the process

6
00:00:19,506 --> 00:00:21,107
we went through to create Breach,

7
00:00:22,148 --> 00:00:26,091
which was originally a game mode for Deus Ex Mankind Divided

8
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:29,353
and has since become a standalone free-to-play game.

9
00:00:30,852 --> 00:00:36,033
So I'm going to start with a quick question. How many of you here have played at least one

10
00:00:36,073 --> 00:00:46,496
Deus Ex game? All right. Mankind Divided? All right. And how many of you here have given a

11
00:00:46,536 --> 00:00:55,138
try to breach? Yeah. Less hands. All right. So for those of you who haven't, I'll start by

12
00:00:55,178 --> 00:00:57,059
quickly explaining what a breach is.

13
00:00:59,013 --> 00:01:01,976
So Breach is a game mode for Deus Ex Mankind Divided.

14
00:01:02,656 --> 00:01:04,698
In Breach, you're not Adam Jensen,

15
00:01:04,718 --> 00:01:06,420
the main protagonist of Mankind Divided.

16
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,264
You are a hacker who uses a VR device

17
00:01:10,364 --> 00:01:12,886
to infiltrate the servers of mega-corporations.

18
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:15,829
Your goal is to steal their secrets.

19
00:01:16,289 --> 00:01:19,232
And to do so, you need to find and download the data

20
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,954
that's hidden inside the levels.

21
00:01:22,402 --> 00:01:24,743
The servers of those megacorporations are hosted

22
00:01:25,163 --> 00:01:28,544
in a super secure facility that we call the Palisade Blade.

23
00:01:29,164 --> 00:01:31,665
And the AI, which runs this facility,

24
00:01:32,066 --> 00:01:33,866
is doing everything it can to stop you.

25
00:01:35,287 --> 00:01:38,288
Breach is an asynchronous online experience.

26
00:01:39,249 --> 00:01:42,110
It's an arcade twist on the Deus Ex gameplay peelers

27
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:45,111
with a leaderboard-based competitive aspect

28
00:01:45,251 --> 00:01:47,592
and some light free-to-play mechanics.

29
00:01:49,236 --> 00:01:52,801
So our launch trailer was actually more than five minutes

30
00:01:52,861 --> 00:01:54,203
long, so I'm going to spare you that.

31
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:59,130
But to give you a better idea if you've never played it, I

32
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,753
will show you our latest trailer, which was actually

33
00:02:01,853 --> 00:02:05,058
out two weeks ago, and sums up the major updates we've been

34
00:02:05,098 --> 00:02:06,900
making to the game since it's launched.

35
00:03:49,704 --> 00:03:55,866
So to tell you about how we created Breach, I need to start by telling you about the Life

36
00:03:55,886 --> 00:04:01,647
Team and our initial mandate. The Deus Ex Life Team was created at Eidos, Montreal at

37
00:04:01,687 --> 00:04:07,589
the beginning of 2014 with the mandate of taking care of all the additional content

38
00:04:07,869 --> 00:04:08,729
for Mankind Divided.

39
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,585
In order to let the core team focus 100% of their energy

40
00:04:14,806 --> 00:04:15,887
on crafting the main game.

41
00:04:16,748 --> 00:04:19,011
That means that any bonus mission,

42
00:04:19,191 --> 00:04:22,735
any additional content, item pack, narrative DLCs,

43
00:04:23,216 --> 00:04:25,518
the post-launch contents and post-launch operations

44
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:27,561
were to be handled by the live team.

45
00:04:29,123 --> 00:04:31,704
The mandate of the team was also to expand

46
00:04:32,245 --> 00:04:35,346
the Deus Ex universe and experiment outside

47
00:04:35,406 --> 00:04:38,887
of the traditional single-player story-driven experience.

48
00:04:39,707 --> 00:04:41,708
And as part of that mandate,

49
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:44,529
we were supposed to deliver challenge maps,

50
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,210
which would be an additional bonus content

51
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,191
available day one for every player.

52
00:04:50,632 --> 00:04:53,353
The pillars of those challenge maps were first

53
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,374
that they had to teach the gameplay mechanics

54
00:04:56,654 --> 00:04:58,094
of Mankind Divided to the players.

55
00:04:59,284 --> 00:05:02,948
and allow them to practice and master those mechanics

56
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:04,949
outside of the story-driven campaign.

57
00:05:06,471 --> 00:05:09,754
Then we're supposed to bring added replay value to the game

58
00:05:10,114 --> 00:05:14,038
while always delivering a true Deus Ex experience.

59
00:05:15,766 --> 00:05:20,268
The constraints we had to work with were that we didn't have a lot of resources.

60
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:24,610
We were a very small team and we had a lot to do.

61
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:30,033
Because again, the challenge maps were only a portion of the additional content we were

62
00:05:30,053 --> 00:05:31,514
making for Mankind Divided.

63
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,515
We also didn't have a lot of time.

64
00:05:35,756 --> 00:05:39,279
We actually started conception one year

65
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:43,082
before the initially planned ship date of the game.

66
00:05:44,163 --> 00:05:45,724
And we also didn't have a lot of money.

67
00:05:47,025 --> 00:05:48,886
Our budget was pretty tight,

68
00:05:49,367 --> 00:05:53,050
so we couldn't compensate neither the size of the team

69
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,852
or the tight schedule with, for instance,

70
00:05:56,032 --> 00:05:57,433
outsourcing some part of the work.

71
00:06:00,113 --> 00:06:02,155
The base idea for those challenge maps

72
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,477
was to reuse existing environments

73
00:06:04,617 --> 00:06:07,259
from the VR tutorial mode of the main game

74
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,902
and implement new objectives for these maps.

75
00:06:11,402 --> 00:06:13,584
So, for instance, there was a shooting range

76
00:06:14,064 --> 00:06:15,005
in that VR tutorial,

77
00:06:15,145 --> 00:06:17,547
and we could have implemented challenges

78
00:06:17,607 --> 00:06:20,969
like shoot all the targets under 30 seconds,

79
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,751
destroy as many targets as possible

80
00:06:23,971 --> 00:06:25,312
using only augmentations,

81
00:06:25,673 --> 00:06:27,834
do as many headshots as possible, et cetera.

82
00:06:29,313 --> 00:06:32,094
So, side note here, if you have played Mankind Divided

83
00:06:32,154 --> 00:06:35,215
and are wondering where the hell were those VR tutorials,

84
00:06:35,275 --> 00:06:37,055
well, they didn't make it to the final game.

85
00:06:39,636 --> 00:06:43,656
So, how did we go from these VR challenges

86
00:06:43,716 --> 00:06:47,097
to a full-on competitive mode with more than 100 levels?

87
00:06:47,977 --> 00:06:51,678
Well, what gave birth to the bridge concept

88
00:06:51,698 --> 00:06:54,178
is probably a combination of five factors.

89
00:06:55,565 --> 00:07:00,187
So first of all, the team wasn't particularly excited by the idea.

90
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:05,709
Both on the actual implementation side of it, but most of all,

91
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:07,910
we didn't think it was going to be really fun for players.

92
00:07:10,215 --> 00:07:13,919
Then there was also inside the studio a recurring topic

93
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:17,202
of wanting to make a hacking-focused game.

94
00:07:18,043 --> 00:07:20,746
It had been around since the development

95
00:07:20,766 --> 00:07:23,569
of Human Revolution, and several concepts

96
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:25,030
were pitched over the years,

97
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,653
but none made it past the initial concept stage.

98
00:07:29,956 --> 00:07:32,398
And since part of the mandate of the life team

99
00:07:32,438 --> 00:07:35,259
was to explore and expand the Deus Ex universe,

100
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,542
we wanted to use the incredibly rich lore at our disposal

101
00:07:39,942 --> 00:07:42,864
and put more narrative meat around the bone.

102
00:07:44,105 --> 00:07:46,167
We very much liked the fantasy

103
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:47,948
of being a super skilled hacker

104
00:07:48,488 --> 00:07:50,790
and the idea of putting at the forefront

105
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,391
those corrupt mega corporations

106
00:07:54,072 --> 00:07:56,493
that are always in the background of Deus Ex games.

107
00:07:58,076 --> 00:08:03,820
Another factor which played a major role in the birth of Breach was that all our level

108
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,642
designers were new to Deus Ex.

109
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:11,586
So they were ramping up on the engine and on the level design rules of the franchise

110
00:08:11,966 --> 00:08:14,008
by playing around in what we call gyms.

111
00:08:15,043 --> 00:08:17,828
where they were building gameplay scenarios

112
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:20,774
using only gray blocks and messing around with them

113
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:24,801
and not paying any attention to the physical constraints

114
00:08:25,322 --> 00:08:27,887
or the environmental credibility.

115
00:08:30,692 --> 00:08:34,033
We realized that the very simple and modular environment

116
00:08:34,073 --> 00:08:37,554
of the VR tutorials would allow them to keep that freedom,

117
00:08:38,234 --> 00:08:41,215
even when they were going to build real levels for the game,

118
00:08:41,856 --> 00:08:43,696
which is not the case when you create

119
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:45,757
a classical Deus Ex narrative mission,

120
00:08:46,797 --> 00:08:49,598
where the credibility of the space and the,

121
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:54,039
sorry, or the credibility of the space

122
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:56,980
plays a major role,

123
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,721
puts a lot of constraints on the level design.

124
00:09:01,418 --> 00:09:05,222
But we still wanted the visual to be carrying some of the narrative.

125
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:09,686
Everything in the art direction of Dosek's Human Revolution and

126
00:09:09,726 --> 00:09:11,968
Mankind Divided is there on purpose.

127
00:09:12,869 --> 00:09:15,652
Everything carries a very heavy symbolic and

128
00:09:15,672 --> 00:09:17,554
we wanted that to be true of Breach too.

129
00:09:19,248 --> 00:09:24,510
The added bonus was that actually in the first months of the existence of the team,

130
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,291
nobody was really looking at us.

131
00:09:28,952 --> 00:09:32,113
All the energy and attention was focused on the main game,

132
00:09:32,553 --> 00:09:35,814
and we were supposed to be progressively ramping up on the franchise,

133
00:09:36,315 --> 00:09:38,455
and we were free to experiment on our own,

134
00:09:39,876 --> 00:09:45,978
without anyone telling us that this was absolutely not what was expected of us.

135
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:51,199
I'll add to that my own background.

136
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,544
I come from mobile and indie, small-budget games.

137
00:09:57,365 --> 00:10:00,128
Deus Ex was my very first AAA experience,

138
00:10:01,129 --> 00:10:04,052
and I was used to making a lot with very little resources.

139
00:10:05,111 --> 00:10:08,893
So my naivety at the time probably played a big role

140
00:10:09,054 --> 00:10:12,096
in allowing the team and even encouraging them

141
00:10:13,016 --> 00:10:14,717
to push the creative boundaries

142
00:10:15,178 --> 00:10:17,579
and to go for something that really excited them,

143
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,101
even if it was way more than what we were supposed to deliver.

144
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:28,299
So when we came up with the idea for Breach, after a brainstorming session,

145
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:35,225
we had a little bit more than a month before the first green light meeting for the live team,

146
00:10:35,806 --> 00:10:40,050
where we were supposed to present our whole creative and production plan

147
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:43,212
for all the contents tied to the Sex, Mankind, Divided.

148
00:10:44,275 --> 00:10:46,615
By this date, we would need to have enough

149
00:10:46,695 --> 00:10:48,136
to convince the higher-ups,

150
00:10:48,596 --> 00:10:50,457
meaning the Square Enix management,

151
00:10:50,777 --> 00:10:55,198
but first of all, the Deus Ex executive of the franchise,

152
00:10:56,358 --> 00:10:57,519
and the studio head,

153
00:10:58,119 --> 00:11:00,820
that Breach was a better concept

154
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,261
than the initially planned challenge maps,

155
00:11:05,121 --> 00:11:06,801
even though it meant a lot more work

156
00:11:07,062 --> 00:11:08,742
and most probably a bigger team

157
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:10,282
than the one originally planned.

158
00:11:11,943 --> 00:11:12,963
So we did two things.

159
00:11:13,768 --> 00:11:18,150
First, we crafted a 50 plus slide presentation of the concept.

160
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:23,412
Detailing our vision for all the gameplay mechanics, the scoring and

161
00:11:23,472 --> 00:11:27,733
reward systems, the level design philosophy, the core loop, the online features,

162
00:11:28,074 --> 00:11:32,155
the character building, the player fantasy, the back story, the ties to the main game,

163
00:11:32,475 --> 00:11:34,836
the business model, the economic loop, all of it.

164
00:11:35,477 --> 00:11:40,740
The presentation detailed the main production milestones for all this and already laid out

165
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,303
which features would be present at launch and which ones would be part of the post-launch

166
00:11:45,343 --> 00:11:45,584
plan.

167
00:11:46,184 --> 00:11:52,989
It also presented how we envisioned the post-launch lifecycle with promotion events, content patches,

168
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:54,370
and balancing updates.

169
00:11:57,863 --> 00:12:01,685
The second thing we did was prototyping the core experience

170
00:12:01,785 --> 00:12:04,206
of Breach, and especially the gameplay parts

171
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:06,327
that were unique to it compared to the main game.

172
00:12:07,147 --> 00:12:10,689
So extracting data, escaping the map, applying modifiers,

173
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:12,590
computing the player score, et cetera.

174
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:16,171
Enough to be able to back up the PowerPoint presentation

175
00:12:16,211 --> 00:12:18,572
with some concrete, hands-on gameplay,

176
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:20,693
and prove the base concept was solid and fun,

177
00:12:21,053 --> 00:12:23,134
even if the deadline was way too tight

178
00:12:23,154 --> 00:12:24,955
for us to have a full first playable.

179
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:31,320
So here's what the game looked like at that time.

180
00:12:32,622 --> 00:12:37,168
And I must warn you, it might hurt your eyes a little bit.

181
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:38,510
This is very old.

182
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:24,011
And you know what? It worked!

183
00:13:28,343 --> 00:13:30,508
Yeah, I'm not sure that deserves that much better.

184
00:13:32,057 --> 00:13:32,617
But it worked.

185
00:13:33,517 --> 00:13:35,437
We were allowed to go on with the development

186
00:13:35,517 --> 00:13:38,138
of our first playable, which we actually delivered

187
00:13:38,158 --> 00:13:41,298
a few weeks later after only three months had passed

188
00:13:41,418 --> 00:13:43,539
since that very first brainstorm on the concept.

189
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:48,640
And I got the green light to add some very much needed

190
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,360
key resources to the team.

191
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,241
Which leads me to a short parenthesis about the team

192
00:13:56,401 --> 00:13:58,541
before going back to the development of Breach itself.

193
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,473
So since the initial mandate of the live team

194
00:14:02,553 --> 00:14:05,074
was essentially to create new content,

195
00:14:05,434 --> 00:14:08,235
and we weren't supposed to be actually adding features,

196
00:14:08,836 --> 00:14:10,176
or very few of them, to the game,

197
00:14:11,157 --> 00:14:13,397
the vast majority of the initial roster

198
00:14:13,698 --> 00:14:15,938
was composed of artists, level designers,

199
00:14:16,118 --> 00:14:17,039
and narrative designers.

200
00:14:18,099 --> 00:14:20,880
The theory was that all we had to do

201
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,861
would be to take the existing systems,

202
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,462
features, and tools developed by the core team,

203
00:14:25,942 --> 00:14:27,383
and use them to create new content.

204
00:14:29,162 --> 00:14:31,803
We would be in charge of creating our own assets

205
00:14:31,843 --> 00:14:34,085
and storylines, of course, but that was mainly it.

206
00:14:35,406 --> 00:14:37,788
But bringing Breach into the mix

207
00:14:37,988 --> 00:14:39,989
created a big recruitment challenge.

208
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,513
It meant that we actually needed more game designers,

209
00:14:44,533 --> 00:14:46,314
audio designers, UI designers,

210
00:14:46,434 --> 00:14:48,315
as well as a bunch of programmers,

211
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:51,578
and not only for gameplay, but for all the online side,

212
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:54,059
and the massive amount of UI we're about to add.

213
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:59,363
Still, we couldn't go crazy and inflate the team too much

214
00:14:59,463 --> 00:15:02,206
because, well, it wouldn't make sense budget-wise.

215
00:15:03,707 --> 00:15:06,210
And one of the biggest challenge in building

216
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,133
the Breach team was to find generalists.

217
00:15:10,774 --> 00:15:14,818
So we basically had to build a team of Swiss Army Knives.

218
00:15:16,266 --> 00:15:19,709
And in the AAA industry, where people are pushed

219
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:23,072
to be hyper specialized, where they invest years

220
00:15:23,212 --> 00:15:25,694
into developing very specific expertise,

221
00:15:26,195 --> 00:15:27,676
this happens to be a very tough thing.

222
00:15:28,657 --> 00:15:32,340
If you add to that, that at that time in the studio,

223
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,924
we were that weird new team labeled as the DLC team,

224
00:15:37,205 --> 00:15:40,467
the B team, and that everybody just wanted to get

225
00:15:40,588 --> 00:15:42,770
on the big AAA core team.

226
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:51,715
finding the right people proved to be very difficult. But you know what? Actually I firmly

227
00:15:51,775 --> 00:15:57,980
believe that this all played a major role on making the team a success. With everybody

228
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:04,025
having a lot of ownership on the content and not only on breach but also all the DLCs and

229
00:16:04,045 --> 00:16:05,566
the other stuff we made from My Kind Divided.

230
00:16:06,483 --> 00:16:09,504
The people who joined us chose to do it.

231
00:16:10,085 --> 00:16:11,665
And since there was not many of us,

232
00:16:12,506 --> 00:16:14,387
everybody had a big role to play

233
00:16:14,867 --> 00:16:17,188
and had the opportunity to be a real part

234
00:16:17,248 --> 00:16:18,288
of the creative process.

235
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:20,589
And since we were a small team,

236
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,271
well, we could all fit in a single room together

237
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,571
to show our work to each other,

238
00:16:24,871 --> 00:16:26,052
to play our game together,

239
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:29,694
and exchange feedback and ideas in a very fluid manner.

240
00:16:30,174 --> 00:16:32,795
And this very quickly created a solid bond

241
00:16:33,115 --> 00:16:34,116
and a sense of belonging.

242
00:16:35,048 --> 00:16:38,021
And I truly believe that we made a better game for it.

243
00:16:40,688 --> 00:16:43,910
The small size of the team also allowed us a lot,

244
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:46,652
to have a lot of interaction between the designers

245
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:47,493
and the programmers.

246
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:51,415
And that was a blessing because given the very tight schedule

247
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:54,057
we were on, we basically did the conception,

248
00:16:54,077 --> 00:16:56,998
the pre-production and the production at the same time.

249
00:16:57,699 --> 00:17:00,581
So some features were actually still being designed

250
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:03,182
at the same time as they were implemented by the progs.

251
00:17:03,502 --> 00:17:04,963
And with a bigger team,

252
00:17:05,003 --> 00:17:06,864
it could have been way more problematic.

253
00:17:07,823 --> 00:17:10,984
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's ideal

254
00:17:11,124 --> 00:17:12,825
and that there wasn't any problem.

255
00:17:13,345 --> 00:17:15,745
And no, this is not the ideal way to do it.

256
00:17:16,685 --> 00:17:19,246
But for us, in a sense, it kind of worked.

257
00:17:22,467 --> 00:17:23,987
So, back to our main subject.

258
00:17:25,387 --> 00:17:27,768
Of course, there are things that sets

259
00:17:28,288 --> 00:17:31,448
immediately breach apart from the core single experience.

260
00:17:33,109 --> 00:17:34,489
First, we throw the player

261
00:17:34,689 --> 00:17:37,210
in a completely different visual environment.

262
00:17:38,607 --> 00:17:41,569
Then we introduced them to the concept of data extraction,

263
00:17:41,709 --> 00:17:43,150
which is unique to Breach.

264
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:46,933
And of course, in Breach, you're not Adam Jensen,

265
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:49,415
but a ripper, a hacker from 2029.

266
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:52,998
Finally, the presence of leaderboards

267
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,160
introduces a competitive element

268
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,682
which doesn't exist at all in the single player.

269
00:17:58,903 --> 00:18:01,605
But still, at its core, Breach respects

270
00:18:01,645 --> 00:18:03,646
the fundamental pillars of Deus Ex.

271
00:18:05,087 --> 00:18:08,367
Apart from a very few, very optional exceptions,

272
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:12,008
all the maps can be played using whatever play style

273
00:18:12,048 --> 00:18:12,988
the player prefers.

274
00:18:13,728 --> 00:18:17,509
From full on ghosting to blasting your way through the level

275
00:18:17,709 --> 00:18:19,830
and everything in between, or even playing

276
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:22,170
without ever using a single augmentation,

277
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:25,451
Breach allows players to approach the challenges

278
00:18:25,811 --> 00:18:26,771
any way they like.

279
00:18:27,551 --> 00:18:30,952
And of course, there are always plenty of different paths

280
00:18:31,012 --> 00:18:32,012
to get to your objective.

281
00:18:33,917 --> 00:18:36,099
But very early during the development process,

282
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:39,261
we made the conscious choice to throw the players

283
00:18:39,482 --> 00:18:40,463
out of their comfort zone,

284
00:18:40,963 --> 00:18:43,465
to offer them the opportunity to try something new,

285
00:18:44,046 --> 00:18:47,029
to discover that maybe they might actually enjoy things

286
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:49,631
that they had never tried in the main campaign.

287
00:18:50,952 --> 00:18:53,374
And we used several different devices

288
00:18:53,494 --> 00:18:57,078
to gently but firmly push them in that direction.

289
00:18:59,468 --> 00:19:02,930
For starters, each of the corporations that you infiltrate

290
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,130
in Breach has its own gameplay personality.

291
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:09,872
So for instance, the Tarvos Corporation is your classic

292
00:19:09,912 --> 00:19:13,533
Deus Ex type layout, filled with mixed defenses

293
00:19:13,733 --> 00:19:15,574
of humanoids, cameras, and lasers,

294
00:19:16,254 --> 00:19:17,935
and of course, a lot of air vents.

295
00:19:19,736 --> 00:19:21,696
Steiner Beasley, on the other hand,

296
00:19:22,657 --> 00:19:25,378
confronts the player to wide open areas,

297
00:19:25,618 --> 00:19:27,218
swarming with guards and turrets.

298
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,944
while the VersaLife levels are all about verticality,

299
00:19:32,224 --> 00:19:34,386
platforming puzzles, and hazards.

300
00:19:35,727 --> 00:19:39,070
Of course, you could apply the same exact gameplay style

301
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:42,413
to all of these maps and still be able to beat them.

302
00:19:43,013 --> 00:19:46,036
But if you are embracing the competitive aspect of Breach,

303
00:19:46,537 --> 00:19:48,378
then you will have to be versatile

304
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:49,880
and adapt the way you play.

305
00:19:53,043 --> 00:19:55,785
We also created and implemented the concept

306
00:19:55,825 --> 00:19:57,846
of what we call AI evolutions.

307
00:19:58,986 --> 00:20:01,747
Every action that the player performs is recorded

308
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:05,529
and taken into account to move one of the three AI meters,

309
00:20:06,069 --> 00:20:07,710
damage, defense, and delay.

310
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:13,072
For instance, offensive actions against the defenses

311
00:20:13,452 --> 00:20:15,533
of the map will increase the damage meter.

312
00:20:16,756 --> 00:20:18,137
and the game will react to it

313
00:20:18,657 --> 00:20:20,639
by making the enemies have better weapons,

314
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:21,800
deal more damages,

315
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,722
or gain some resistance to some type of damages.

316
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:28,104
Once this has happened enough times,

317
00:20:29,265 --> 00:20:30,666
the player has two choices,

318
00:20:31,747 --> 00:20:34,929
using pretty rare items that we call nuke viruses

319
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,910
to downgrade the AI evolution

320
00:20:37,651 --> 00:20:40,593
because it's now pretty hardcore,

321
00:20:40,613 --> 00:20:43,295
or simply opt for a less aggressive play style,

322
00:20:43,655 --> 00:20:44,496
staying out of combat.

323
00:20:46,063 --> 00:20:51,145
Of course, true to the Deus Ex philosophy, the same principle applies to actions oriented

324
00:20:51,165 --> 00:21:00,108
towards stealth or hacking. The way we handle the equipment available for the player also

325
00:21:00,148 --> 00:21:06,990
plays a big role into bringing them out of their comfort zone. Everybody starts Breach with

326
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:12,551
the same basic loadout, but one of the main differences with the single player is that

327
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,692
there is no loot inside the levels.

328
00:21:15,676 --> 00:21:18,897
Enemies vanish once they have been eliminated.

329
00:21:19,357 --> 00:21:21,077
So there is no corpse to loot from.

330
00:21:21,618 --> 00:21:24,018
Instead, all the equipment needed by the player,

331
00:21:24,578 --> 00:21:28,500
the weapons, the ammunitions, the healing items, et cetera,

332
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,560
are found in randomized booster packs

333
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,941
that players are either awarded

334
00:21:33,621 --> 00:21:35,642
or that they can purchase with the credits

335
00:21:35,702 --> 00:21:37,442
that they gain from extracting the data.

336
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:45,437
the randomness factor is very important because it means that there is a very good chance

337
00:21:45,578 --> 00:21:51,179
you won't get your favorite weapon before a while. And even if you get it, the rarity

338
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:57,001
system, which is another feature unique to Breach, might cause you to get a very powerful,

339
00:21:57,221 --> 00:22:03,583
say, sniper rifle when your favorite weapon that you've used in the single player campaign

340
00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:04,183
is a shotgun.

341
00:22:05,495 --> 00:22:09,677
But if you get a very rare class S sniper rifle,

342
00:22:09,737 --> 00:22:12,098
super powerful, it might make you think twice

343
00:22:12,158 --> 00:22:16,040
before you just stick on using your old class C

344
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,160
super weak shotgun.

345
00:22:19,301 --> 00:22:22,382
But different enemies have different weaknesses

346
00:22:22,682 --> 00:22:24,343
or resistances, and there again,

347
00:22:24,423 --> 00:22:27,404
players also have to adapt and get out of their comfort zone

348
00:22:27,424 --> 00:22:29,345
to try out new weapons and strategies.

349
00:22:33,002 --> 00:22:36,787
The leaderboards are also a way for us to give an incentive

350
00:22:36,807 --> 00:22:38,369
to players to try new things.

351
00:22:39,671 --> 00:22:42,154
Each of the bridge level has two leaderboards,

352
00:22:42,474 --> 00:22:43,536
score and time.

353
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:47,081
Obviously someone cheated there.

354
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:51,743
Aiming for the top of the time leaderboard

355
00:22:51,923 --> 00:22:54,523
means trying to complete your main objective

356
00:22:54,563 --> 00:22:57,664
and escape the map in the minimum amount of time possible.

357
00:22:58,484 --> 00:23:00,785
Which means ignoring side objectives,

358
00:23:01,545 --> 00:23:04,766
not losing any time getting into fights with the AIs,

359
00:23:05,306 --> 00:23:07,327
not exploring for any hidden data,

360
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:12,028
and finding the best augmentation combination possible

361
00:23:12,068 --> 00:23:14,408
to exploit every shortcut in the map.

362
00:23:15,651 --> 00:23:18,977
Thus, being on top of the time leaderboard

363
00:23:19,478 --> 00:23:21,160
has a very good chance to mean

364
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,464
that your score will totally suck.

365
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:27,299
Well, on the other end, if you take your time in the map,

366
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:30,901
if you chain XP, heavy actions, if you hack everything,

367
00:23:31,262 --> 00:23:32,943
if you take down or kill everyone,

368
00:23:33,163 --> 00:23:35,684
if you destroy every robotic defense

369
00:23:35,964 --> 00:23:38,406
and find every single bit of data,

370
00:23:38,926 --> 00:23:42,108
your score has a very good chance to be on the higher end,

371
00:23:42,568 --> 00:23:45,590
putting you in a better position on the score leaderboard,

372
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:49,652
but make you fail down on the time leaderboard.

373
00:23:51,457 --> 00:23:56,561
For the anecdote, the time leader wasn't really part

374
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,802
of the initial concept.

375
00:23:58,763 --> 00:24:00,985
But when we started playing the game on the floor,

376
00:24:01,645 --> 00:24:03,667
we realized that the speed running aspect

377
00:24:03,747 --> 00:24:05,809
it was bringing to the Deus Ex gameplay

378
00:24:05,849 --> 00:24:07,590
was probably one of the most exciting

379
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,131
and unique features of Breach.

380
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:13,988
It is also the one that has generated

381
00:24:14,089 --> 00:24:15,549
the most emergent gameplay,

382
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,451
both in user testing and on the floor.

383
00:24:19,072 --> 00:24:21,513
And there is nothing more satisfying

384
00:24:21,694 --> 00:24:24,535
than the look on the level designers face

385
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:27,998
when they see your name on the leaderboard of a map

386
00:24:28,058 --> 00:24:30,820
that they've designed next to a time lower

387
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,781
than they thought was possible to achieve.

388
00:24:36,443 --> 00:24:37,224
We actually made.

389
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:40,997
one exception to the golden rule of freedom of play style.

390
00:24:41,918 --> 00:24:44,860
And some of the maps in Breach require that the players

391
00:24:45,201 --> 00:24:47,763
reach their data objective without being detected,

392
00:24:48,223 --> 00:24:49,744
forcing them to play stealth.

393
00:24:50,665 --> 00:24:52,627
These maps are always on optional path

394
00:24:52,727 --> 00:24:55,549
in the overall progression, but completionists

395
00:24:55,809 --> 00:24:58,471
will have to defeat them if they want to beat

396
00:24:58,511 --> 00:24:59,032
100% of the levels.

397
00:24:59,512 --> 00:25:03,415
And I admit this was completely arbitrary decision

398
00:25:04,176 --> 00:25:06,177
because we are kind of biased towards stealth.

399
00:25:09,723 --> 00:25:13,465
For some reason, we thought it would also be really cool

400
00:25:13,505 --> 00:25:15,807
to have some heavy platforming navigation

401
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,808
in some of the levels, mainly in the VersoLife maps.

402
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:23,944
But since all the three C's were inherited

403
00:25:24,144 --> 00:25:26,486
from the main game, which has next to no

404
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:30,089
platforming mechanics, solving all the ledge grab

405
00:25:30,189 --> 00:25:34,073
and jumping related bugs was kind of super low priority

406
00:25:34,173 --> 00:25:36,915
for the core team, which is totally understandable.

407
00:25:37,896 --> 00:25:41,879
So for a very long time, while our user tests

408
00:25:41,979 --> 00:25:45,102
suffered very badly from the frustration

409
00:25:45,122 --> 00:25:46,723
this was causing to players.

410
00:25:47,543 --> 00:25:49,804
who pretty much looked like this.

411
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:56,286
Yup, that's it.

412
00:25:58,467 --> 00:26:01,768
But the bright side of this is that it actually pushed us

413
00:26:01,808 --> 00:26:05,330
to develop one of the coolest bridge-specific augmentations

414
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,970
which is the multi-jump.

415
00:26:10,592 --> 00:26:13,313
And it ended up solving a lot of our let's wrap issues.

416
00:26:14,617 --> 00:26:17,937
Another area where we tried to bite off more than we could

417
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:21,738
chew was the AI and especially its behavior related to

418
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:22,519
data towers.

419
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:27,740
Originally the design was that downloading data would

420
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:31,601
attract the AI's attention and that the player would have

421
00:26:31,781 --> 00:26:35,162
to stay near the tower while the data was downloaded

422
00:26:35,522 --> 00:26:37,983
which meant that they would have to either fight the

423
00:26:38,003 --> 00:26:41,964
incoming AIs or find a way to stay near but undetected

424
00:26:42,084 --> 00:26:43,104
if they were going for stealth.

425
00:26:44,573 --> 00:26:47,777
Unfortunately, that meant some heavy work on the AI side.

426
00:26:48,217 --> 00:26:51,501
And since the team didn't have a dedicated AI programmer,

427
00:26:51,981 --> 00:26:54,664
we never managed to get a satisfying result,

428
00:26:55,185 --> 00:26:56,286
and not for lack of trying.

429
00:26:57,808 --> 00:27:01,232
So after long debates, and with a lot of regrets,

430
00:27:01,592 --> 00:27:03,194
we dropped this part of the design.

431
00:27:04,459 --> 00:27:06,860
But the funny thing is that we discovered

432
00:27:06,941 --> 00:27:09,642
it actually made the game way better.

433
00:27:10,202 --> 00:27:12,664
It made it way more dynamic and fast-paced,

434
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,685
which was a really good thing.

435
00:27:15,065 --> 00:27:18,167
And it played really well into our already established bias

436
00:27:18,547 --> 00:27:19,428
towards speed running.

437
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:25,591
Another fundamental pillar of a Deus Ex game

438
00:27:25,691 --> 00:27:27,032
is the choice and consequences.

439
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:30,574
And without the whole social aspect of the single player,

440
00:27:31,114 --> 00:27:33,696
we had to transcribe this into gameplay features.

441
00:27:34,888 --> 00:27:38,375
So for instance, we created modifiers that we call patches.

442
00:27:39,637 --> 00:27:42,743
Patches are applied to a map and modify the rules,

443
00:27:43,104 --> 00:27:45,849
making the map harder in exchange for a score bonus.

444
00:27:47,061 --> 00:27:51,383
Some patches have a direct effect on the player or the AI.

445
00:27:51,723 --> 00:27:54,424
Like for instance, draining the player's life every second

446
00:27:54,544 --> 00:27:56,265
or giving a region to the enemies.

447
00:27:56,925 --> 00:28:00,947
While other patches are conditional and can be failed.

448
00:28:01,087 --> 00:28:03,708
Like for instance, if the player sustains any damage

449
00:28:04,129 --> 00:28:07,690
during the level or uses any weapon other than a pistol.

450
00:28:09,175 --> 00:28:12,556
Failing those patches won't make the player fail the level,

451
00:28:12,636 --> 00:28:14,817
but they won't get the score bonus tied to it,

452
00:28:14,977 --> 00:28:17,478
and since the patches are consumed on use,

453
00:28:17,938 --> 00:28:20,679
players might want to be careful on when to use them.

454
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:26,381
And of course, the meaner the patch used by the player,

455
00:28:26,401 --> 00:28:27,682
the bigger the bonus is.

456
00:28:28,782 --> 00:28:30,863
And if you're feeling extra confident

457
00:28:30,923 --> 00:28:32,584
about your skill on a particular level,

458
00:28:32,624 --> 00:28:36,005
well, you can even stack patches for a bigger bonus.

459
00:28:38,953 --> 00:28:41,135
We also made a major modification

460
00:28:41,255 --> 00:28:43,236
to the augmentation tree system

461
00:28:43,377 --> 00:28:46,279
by adding a memory space cost to each aug.

462
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,082
This means that even if the player

463
00:28:50,122 --> 00:28:51,503
has gained enough praxis kits

464
00:28:51,543 --> 00:28:53,905
to unlock all of the available augmentations,

465
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:56,748
the limited memory space available

466
00:28:56,848 --> 00:28:59,830
prevents them from equipping all the augs at the same time.

467
00:29:01,092 --> 00:29:04,593
And since once a level has started, the Aug tree is locked.

468
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:07,014
Players must make a conscious choice

469
00:29:07,574 --> 00:29:09,675
before entering a level on which Augs

470
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:10,615
they want to take with them.

471
00:29:11,255 --> 00:29:13,096
Of course, this choice should be different

472
00:29:13,696 --> 00:29:15,777
depending on the actual map they're trying to beat

473
00:29:15,997 --> 00:29:18,118
and if they're going for score or for time

474
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:19,978
and of course based on their play style.

475
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,361
I'm sorry.

476
00:29:26,421 --> 00:29:26,541
Yes.

477
00:29:28,431 --> 00:29:31,933
The inventory system, a big classic of Deus Ex,

478
00:29:32,214 --> 00:29:35,436
was also revisited with the choice and consequences in mind.

479
00:29:36,457 --> 00:29:39,359
In Breach, the players actually have two inventories.

480
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,922
The reserve, which is basically a stash with infinite space

481
00:29:44,443 --> 00:29:46,665
where all the items found in booster packs go,

482
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:50,047
and the loadout, which contains everything the player

483
00:29:50,107 --> 00:29:52,449
has access to while breaching a level.

484
00:29:53,662 --> 00:29:56,744
The loadout reuses the main game's inventory system,

485
00:29:56,984 --> 00:29:59,586
but with heavily limited available space.

486
00:29:59,926 --> 00:30:02,888
So that, here again, players are faced

487
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:05,249
with a strategic choice about what to bring

488
00:30:05,409 --> 00:30:06,710
with them inside the levels.

489
00:30:07,191 --> 00:30:08,892
Depending on their play style,

490
00:30:09,272 --> 00:30:12,174
or the type of defenses they can expect to face in there.

491
00:30:14,535 --> 00:30:17,898
We also created items which give you bonuses

492
00:30:18,118 --> 00:30:20,059
as long as they are present in your loadout.

493
00:30:20,659 --> 00:30:22,521
This means that you have to trade space

494
00:30:23,756 --> 00:30:25,917
in exchange for that bonus.

495
00:30:26,037 --> 00:30:28,658
And that space would be otherwise used for weapons

496
00:30:28,738 --> 00:30:30,419
or ammunitions or healing items.

497
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:32,479
And of course, the bigger the bonus,

498
00:30:32,739 --> 00:30:34,580
the more space you have to sacrifice for it.

499
00:30:38,362 --> 00:30:40,342
Now, let's talk visual.

500
00:30:41,223 --> 00:30:45,004
So, at first glance, the art direction of Breach

501
00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:47,465
can feel completely disconnected from the visual style

502
00:30:47,525 --> 00:30:50,006
of both Human Revolution and Mankind Divided.

503
00:30:50,626 --> 00:30:52,367
But it's actually far from being the case.

504
00:30:53,878 --> 00:30:56,060
So first came the fuchsia.

505
00:30:56,961 --> 00:30:58,563
So for those of you who haven't played

506
00:30:59,063 --> 00:31:00,525
Human Revolution or Mankind Divided,

507
00:31:00,545 --> 00:31:02,807
who have played them, sorry,

508
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:04,729
I don't know if you've noticed,

509
00:31:05,309 --> 00:31:09,614
but there is no fuchsia or a pink or a purple in the game.

510
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,658
It is the forbidden color of the deus ex art bible,

511
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:15,740
with one exception.

512
00:31:17,014 --> 00:31:18,835
It is worn by Eliza Kassan,

513
00:31:19,176 --> 00:31:21,217
one of the major characters of the game,

514
00:31:21,558 --> 00:31:24,220
who, it turns out, isn't real.

515
00:31:25,401 --> 00:31:26,903
I'm sorry for any spoiler.

516
00:31:28,885 --> 00:31:33,549
Eliza is an AI, so it made immediate sense to us

517
00:31:33,869 --> 00:31:35,511
to make it the base color of Breach.

518
00:31:37,292 --> 00:31:38,233
The color of data.

519
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,942
When we submitted this idea to Jonathan Jacques Beltet,

520
00:31:42,362 --> 00:31:44,505
the executive art director of the franchise,

521
00:31:45,126 --> 00:31:48,550
he immediately embraced it and gave us his benediction

522
00:31:48,611 --> 00:31:50,072
to use the forbidden color.

523
00:31:53,397 --> 00:31:57,622
So once we had the fuchsia, came the corporations.

524
00:31:58,756 --> 00:32:01,817
So for various reasons, among which giving

525
00:32:01,957 --> 00:32:05,399
as much freedom possible to the level designers

526
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:08,920
and working with modules to get production costs

527
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:13,202
under control, we wanted to keep the art style very simple,

528
00:32:13,982 --> 00:32:15,983
but we needed it to convey the narrative,

529
00:32:16,363 --> 00:32:18,664
and especially the real world backstory

530
00:32:18,964 --> 00:32:21,285
of the various corporations that you infiltrate

531
00:32:21,425 --> 00:32:22,145
in the VR world.

532
00:32:23,515 --> 00:32:26,516
So while the base building blocks are the same

533
00:32:26,657 --> 00:32:29,298
in every level with a white outer shell,

534
00:32:29,618 --> 00:32:31,799
black inner blocks, and fuchsia magma,

535
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:35,782
we played with the shapes and the lighting

536
00:32:36,042 --> 00:32:39,244
to give each server a very different mood.

537
00:32:40,444 --> 00:32:42,205
And we created specific landmarks

538
00:32:42,325 --> 00:32:44,607
which both help convey the narrative

539
00:32:44,927 --> 00:32:47,568
and serve as orientation device for the player.

540
00:32:49,027 --> 00:32:51,688
So for instance, in the Deus Ex universe,

541
00:32:52,229 --> 00:32:56,251
the Steiner-Beasley Corporation is a German corporation

542
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:58,152
which manufactures weapons.

543
00:32:59,213 --> 00:33:01,074
So in the VR world of Breach,

544
00:33:01,414 --> 00:33:03,635
their servers are foundry-like rooms

545
00:33:03,996 --> 00:33:07,938
with pixelated magma and orange fog in the air.

546
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:11,133
and in the ceiling of the Talonpike map,

547
00:33:11,973 --> 00:33:15,537
a giant grinder rotates in an infinite loop,

548
00:33:16,638 --> 00:33:19,680
breaking down the data magma into data shards.

549
00:33:23,604 --> 00:33:25,966
Then, of course, once we had the corporations,

550
00:33:26,006 --> 00:33:27,548
we had to populate the world.

551
00:33:28,448 --> 00:33:30,791
And we started with the Reaper's Avatar.

552
00:33:32,317 --> 00:33:34,659
And among our production constraints,

553
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,842
we had to work with Adam Jensen.

554
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:40,044
We had to reuse him as much as we could

555
00:33:40,484 --> 00:33:41,645
in terms of gameplay, of course,

556
00:33:41,725 --> 00:33:43,407
but also in terms of animation,

557
00:33:43,847 --> 00:33:47,070
overall builds, down to his geometry,

558
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:48,591
and especially his arms,

559
00:33:48,851 --> 00:33:51,113
because we didn't have any rigger,

560
00:33:51,453 --> 00:33:53,615
any skinner, or any animator on the team.

561
00:33:55,487 --> 00:33:58,189
So the challenge was to turn that constraint

562
00:33:58,449 --> 00:33:59,690
into a design element,

563
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:03,573
which ended up with that dual material look,

564
00:34:04,014 --> 00:34:07,677
the solid black arms, which are the original models,

565
00:34:08,517 --> 00:34:11,160
and the more abstract-looking gold triangles,

566
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:14,442
which were both a way to have it stand out

567
00:34:14,683 --> 00:34:17,565
against the mostly black and white environments,

568
00:34:18,286 --> 00:34:21,028
and a nod to Human Revolution's

569
00:34:21,088 --> 00:34:22,489
collector's edition key art.

570
00:34:26,554 --> 00:34:29,417
And once the logic of the VR world had been laid out,

571
00:34:29,737 --> 00:34:32,501
designing the enemies was only a matter of figuring out

572
00:34:33,262 --> 00:34:35,204
how that world would generate them.

573
00:34:36,305 --> 00:34:38,909
So, as for almost everything else,

574
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:41,131
we inherited most of the enemies

575
00:34:41,171 --> 00:34:42,593
from Mankind Divided's casts.

576
00:34:43,074 --> 00:34:46,217
So, drones, the sentry boats, the turrets, et cetera.

577
00:34:47,006 --> 00:34:50,609
But the humanoids that we call the sentinels,

578
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:56,593
they stood out as they were the only human-like in breach

579
00:34:56,893 --> 00:34:59,755
among the mostly mechanical other enemy types.

580
00:35:00,456 --> 00:35:03,178
And in the context of being inside the machine,

581
00:35:03,658 --> 00:35:05,379
it kind of felt out of place.

582
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,862
And that's a key notion in the Deus Ex franchise,

583
00:35:09,042 --> 00:35:11,063
that everything has to feel logical,

584
00:35:11,163 --> 00:35:14,225
that everything has to be credible

585
00:35:14,285 --> 00:35:15,506
and to belong with the rest.

586
00:35:16,554 --> 00:35:23,196
So we came up with the idea that while the rest of the defenses were logical defense

587
00:35:23,296 --> 00:35:29,138
systems in the context of breach, which again is a machine using machine-like units to

588
00:35:29,198 --> 00:35:36,900
defend itself, the Sentinels were a response to the presence of the Reaper. It's the AI

589
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,581
from the Palisade that is trying to come up with something to match the new threat that the

590
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:42,161
Reapers are.

591
00:35:43,868 --> 00:35:46,810
So we tried to have a humanoid that felt like

592
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:50,271
an approximation, an average, and we got inspired

593
00:35:50,351 --> 00:35:52,912
by the point clouds that you can see

594
00:35:53,092 --> 00:35:54,773
in a Kinect's infrared feed.

595
00:35:55,774 --> 00:35:58,295
In motion, you can tell it's human,

596
00:35:58,815 --> 00:36:02,357
but in a static frame, it's only abstract data,

597
00:36:03,177 --> 00:36:06,598
which felt like how the AI would perceive the reapers.

598
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:11,564
Once we had that down, all we had to do was making sure

599
00:36:11,624 --> 00:36:13,367
that the Sentinel's building blocks

600
00:36:13,507 --> 00:36:14,769
came from the same rule sets

601
00:36:15,029 --> 00:36:17,312
that define all of the other elements of the world.

602
00:36:17,853 --> 00:36:21,278
So the black cubes and the white triangular plating,

603
00:36:21,999 --> 00:36:22,440
and voila.

604
00:36:28,081 --> 00:36:31,203
So in the first iteration of the bridge concept,

605
00:36:31,383 --> 00:36:34,945
the narrative layer was extremely thin.

606
00:36:35,705 --> 00:36:37,366
There was the backstory of the bridge,

607
00:36:37,726 --> 00:36:39,847
the references to the Deus Ex corporations,

608
00:36:40,148 --> 00:36:42,029
and the symbolism of the art style.

609
00:36:43,229 --> 00:36:46,611
And we had planned to hide pieces of information

610
00:36:47,091 --> 00:36:49,033
inside the data downloaded in the level.

611
00:36:49,653 --> 00:36:52,034
Players would stumble across those pieces

612
00:36:52,134 --> 00:36:54,896
more or less randomly and get insights

613
00:36:55,276 --> 00:36:57,257
on characters and factions from the main game.

614
00:36:58,456 --> 00:37:02,739
But we realized fairly quickly that we couldn't be making a Deus Ex game,

615
00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:06,241
even a game mode, without a stronger narrative layer.

616
00:37:07,101 --> 00:37:11,904
Because Deus Ex is a story heavy franchise and, oops, sorry.

617
00:37:13,005 --> 00:37:18,609
And the Breach was already weird enough in itself without taking the risk

618
00:37:18,649 --> 00:37:22,091
to alienate our core story driven players from the beginning.

619
00:37:23,597 --> 00:37:26,919
But we also didn't have the resources or the budget

620
00:37:27,019 --> 00:37:29,240
to tell stories in the traditional way,

621
00:37:29,621 --> 00:37:32,042
to make cut scenes, to record voiceovers,

622
00:37:32,403 --> 00:37:34,004
to handle branching conversations.

623
00:37:35,645 --> 00:37:38,507
Then we discovered that the core team had developed

624
00:37:38,687 --> 00:37:40,548
a text messenger system for the main game.

625
00:37:41,369 --> 00:37:44,891
And since having text-based interaction with people

626
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,812
totally made sense in the context of Reach,

627
00:37:47,052 --> 00:37:48,733
which takes place inside a computer,

628
00:37:49,714 --> 00:37:52,276
we decided to use it as a foundation for our storytelling.

629
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:57,440
So this is how we came up with the dark net files,

630
00:37:57,741 --> 00:38:00,322
which are self-contained conspiracies

631
00:38:00,442 --> 00:38:02,823
that you get to investigate by infiltrating

632
00:38:02,883 --> 00:38:05,544
specific servers in search of data shards.

633
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:09,886
Along the way, contacts help you decrypt

634
00:38:10,066 --> 00:38:12,427
or make sense of the data, ask you for help,

635
00:38:12,587 --> 00:38:15,168
or send you to attack designated servers

636
00:38:15,228 --> 00:38:18,730
to disrupt the real world security systems

637
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:21,771
of a corporation while they physically infiltrate it.

638
00:38:23,577 --> 00:38:26,358
Each conversation with contacts has branching choices

639
00:38:27,158 --> 00:38:30,040
and the system carries over your relationship status

640
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,201
with your contacts from one case to another.

641
00:38:33,021 --> 00:38:34,862
So for instance, if you've been a dick

642
00:38:34,922 --> 00:38:36,603
with a contact in the VersaLife case,

643
00:38:37,003 --> 00:38:38,904
when you will need this contact's help

644
00:38:39,184 --> 00:38:40,825
in the Steiner Bizet case, well,

645
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:43,186
they will ask you for a higher price

646
00:38:43,406 --> 00:38:44,586
in exchange for their services.

647
00:38:46,597 --> 00:38:48,279
At the end of each Darknet file,

648
00:38:48,479 --> 00:38:50,541
when the player has solved the case,

649
00:38:50,921 --> 00:38:53,303
a PyCast news broadcast is shown to them,

650
00:38:53,763 --> 00:38:57,206
making the link between what they did in the VR world

651
00:38:57,487 --> 00:38:59,689
and the impact it had on the real world.

652
00:39:00,269 --> 00:39:00,910
Here's an example.

653
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:16,006
We now turn to Lyon, France, where earlier today, the Santo Group held a press conference debunking what they claim are unfounded rumors regarding their Grand Rapida project.

654
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:24,571
Santo felt the need to respond, after allegedly leaked documents on the internet began to cast doubt on the project's integrity.

655
00:39:25,492 --> 00:39:30,233
A representative assures us that every home paid for is in fact being built,

656
00:39:30,893 --> 00:39:38,955
and that their city of the future is well on track to accommodate the more than 100,000 augmented people projected to move there.

657
00:39:39,655 --> 00:39:47,998
Any information to the contrary, they claim, is the product of doctored reports being uploaded by malicious hackers called Rippers,

658
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:50,698
in an effort to discredit the corporation.

659
00:39:51,619 --> 00:40:03,133
I do not know about you folks, but I prefer to trust the people in suits over these mysterious rippers who will not even reveal their names, or just how they came across their information.

660
00:40:04,294 --> 00:40:08,680
This is Eliza Kassan, reporting to you, live, from Pycus.

661
00:40:11,489 --> 00:40:15,032
The Dark Knight files are a perfect example of a feature

662
00:40:15,292 --> 00:40:17,994
built on top of something developed for the main game

663
00:40:18,314 --> 00:40:20,456
that we repurposed for our own needs

664
00:40:21,096 --> 00:40:24,639
and to which we added a few Brichonnet specifics.

665
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,321
All the writing was done inside the team

666
00:40:27,401 --> 00:40:29,943
but in close collaboration with Marie de Marle,

667
00:40:30,723 --> 00:40:33,606
the executive narrative director of the Deus Ex franchise

668
00:40:33,646 --> 00:40:35,667
who's also the keeper of the lore.

669
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:42,495
The Darknet files turned out to be one of the most appreciated features of Breach in user testing

670
00:40:42,795 --> 00:40:48,840
and one of the hooks that allowed us to get the story-driven players to give a chance to the mode

671
00:40:49,261 --> 00:40:52,043
while they would probably have ignored it otherwise.

672
00:40:53,204 --> 00:41:00,750
The newscasts at the end are also a very simple and efficient way to tie in the world of Breach and the Reapers

673
00:41:01,071 --> 00:41:04,273
to the world of Mankind Divided and of Adam Jensen.

674
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:08,659
We actually managed to do quite a few of these tie-ins,

675
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:10,920
integrating references to the Breach

676
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,481
in the single-player experience.

677
00:41:13,102 --> 00:41:16,124
This ad, for instance, seen in Mankind Divided,

678
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:19,907
shows the Palisade Blade, which is the physical facility

679
00:41:20,007 --> 00:41:21,888
that's hosting the servers

680
00:41:21,929 --> 00:41:23,750
that the Reapers infiltrate in Breach.

681
00:41:24,751 --> 00:41:26,932
In the single-player campaign, also,

682
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:29,754
Jensen has to go inside the VR world

683
00:41:29,834 --> 00:41:31,356
to steal some information,

684
00:41:31,576 --> 00:41:33,157
and the environment that is used

685
00:41:33,297 --> 00:41:35,679
is actually a modified map from Breach.

686
00:41:37,562 --> 00:41:40,444
But our biggest tie-in was, logically,

687
00:41:40,785 --> 00:41:42,566
one of the live team's productions.

688
00:41:43,687 --> 00:41:47,229
System Rift, our first narrative DLC for Mankind Divided,

689
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:49,871
explains how the bridge came to be.

690
00:41:50,672 --> 00:41:52,634
And of course, it's all Jensen's fault.

691
00:41:53,935 --> 00:41:56,516
And it introduces players to Shadowchild,

692
00:41:56,817 --> 00:41:59,719
a famous hacker who turns out to be the one

693
00:41:59,779 --> 00:42:01,520
who's guiding you inside Bridge.

694
00:42:05,383 --> 00:42:05,523
Now,

695
00:42:07,154 --> 00:42:10,800
Let's talk about the more sensitive stuff, shall we?

696
00:42:12,462 --> 00:42:15,548
So it's not uncommon today to have microtransactions

697
00:42:15,688 --> 00:42:18,553
in the multiplayer live modes of games

698
00:42:18,933 --> 00:42:21,437
on all platforms and in premium games.

699
00:42:22,685 --> 00:42:24,667
As it is a completely different experience

700
00:42:24,847 --> 00:42:26,889
that you add on top of the game,

701
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,911
it doesn't impact the main experience.

702
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:33,416
And being a life team, exploring alternative revenue,

703
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,701
revenue models, was part of our initial mandate.

704
00:42:38,842 --> 00:42:43,385
But we were all very aware of the fact that players would already have spent $60,

705
00:42:44,466 --> 00:42:50,751
or if you're based in Canada like us, $80, to buy Mankind Divided.

706
00:42:51,352 --> 00:42:55,095
And that it would be extremely unfair to put up any kind of paywall.

707
00:42:55,835 --> 00:43:00,259
It was also very clear to us that any real money spent had to be completely

708
00:43:00,499 --> 00:43:03,301
optional and shouldn't be turning the game into a pay to win.

709
00:43:05,251 --> 00:43:07,512
We also had one big disadvantage.

710
00:43:08,173 --> 00:43:10,715
Deus Ex is mainly a first-person game,

711
00:43:11,715 --> 00:43:14,297
even if the cover system and the takedown

712
00:43:14,357 --> 00:43:15,978
switch the camera to third person.

713
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:19,641
And Breach is not a PvP real-time multiplayer,

714
00:43:19,921 --> 00:43:22,262
so the interests of vanity items,

715
00:43:22,803 --> 00:43:25,805
which are the most accepted form of microtransactions,

716
00:43:25,985 --> 00:43:27,126
was vastly limited.

717
00:43:28,807 --> 00:43:30,988
In the end, our monetized features

718
00:43:31,068 --> 00:43:32,970
can be broken down into three categories.

719
00:43:34,698 --> 00:43:38,103
First, we have accelerators, or using money

720
00:43:38,183 --> 00:43:41,027
to obtain faster something you could have otherwise

721
00:43:41,087 --> 00:43:43,571
obtained by simply playing the game a little longer.

722
00:43:45,619 --> 00:43:48,821
Then we have the cool, weird stuff,

723
00:43:49,802 --> 00:43:51,102
like our premium weapons,

724
00:43:51,403 --> 00:43:56,126
which are not more powerful than other S or A grade weapons

725
00:43:56,506 --> 00:43:59,347
that you can obtain in regular booster packs

726
00:43:59,388 --> 00:44:01,789
that you can purchase with the in-game currency.

727
00:44:02,509 --> 00:44:06,752
They just have a unique skin and unique gameplay features.

728
00:44:07,633 --> 00:44:08,573
And believe me.

729
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:13,045
Some are really weirder than powerful.

730
00:44:13,706 --> 00:44:15,548
Like our no scope rifle,

731
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:18,953
which is a very powerful sniper rifle,

732
00:44:19,093 --> 00:44:21,696
except its scope is obstructed.

733
00:44:22,217 --> 00:44:25,601
So you can't use it and you can only do hip fire

734
00:44:25,922 --> 00:44:26,863
with the sniper rifle.

735
00:44:29,899 --> 00:44:32,961
Finally, vanity items like our unique skins

736
00:44:33,021 --> 00:44:34,481
for the Reaper avatar.

737
00:44:35,442 --> 00:44:37,723
We still went for them, even considering

738
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:41,485
the previously mentioned factors of the first person game,

739
00:44:42,425 --> 00:44:45,027
but we did bet on getting some interest in them

740
00:44:45,687 --> 00:44:46,307
from streamers.

741
00:44:50,209 --> 00:44:54,011
So when I say that we were careful with demonetization,

742
00:44:54,952 --> 00:44:56,192
I'm really not joking.

743
00:44:57,277 --> 00:45:02,740
We had pretty heated debates about what was crossing the line or not, and when in doubt,

744
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:08,824
we always defaulted to not going with something that could be perceived even a tiny bit

745
00:45:09,024 --> 00:45:17,409
borderline. In the end, we probably wasted a lot of energy on this for nothing.

746
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:22,413
No matter how careful, how respectful we try to be

747
00:45:22,533 --> 00:45:25,696
in our economic design, what we really didn't foresee

748
00:45:26,296 --> 00:45:30,740
was that our player base was absolutely not ready for this.

749
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:34,602
And while the critical reception for breach

750
00:45:34,943 --> 00:45:37,405
from the press was really good,

751
00:45:38,085 --> 00:45:41,107
and we didn't hide the monetization from them,

752
00:45:41,968 --> 00:45:48,476
The simple presence of real money transactions in the game created an unforeseen outrage among

753
00:45:48,516 --> 00:45:53,381
our players. And it completely overshadowed everything else.

754
00:45:55,236 --> 00:45:56,836
Things would probably have been different

755
00:45:57,156 --> 00:45:59,197
if Breach had been released right away

756
00:45:59,517 --> 00:46:02,178
as a standalone Deus Ex universe free-to-play game.

757
00:46:02,938 --> 00:46:05,699
But as a game mode, offered as a bonus

758
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:07,459
alongside a full-price game,

759
00:46:07,879 --> 00:46:10,160
the monetization was a deal breaker

760
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:13,441
for a big majority of the players of Mankind Divided.

761
00:46:15,541 --> 00:46:20,342
And this, for me, is where the experimentation

762
00:46:20,562 --> 00:46:21,743
found its limits.

763
00:46:25,059 --> 00:46:30,523
I'm extremely proud of the work the team has done with Breach.

764
00:46:31,624 --> 00:46:37,508
And I truly believe that we have proved we could take the core DNA of the franchise

765
00:46:38,068 --> 00:46:43,572
and make something extremely innovative and different without betraying it.

766
00:46:44,932 --> 00:46:50,976
The only issue is that the business model was not ready to be experimented with.

767
00:46:55,044 --> 00:46:59,286
So to wrap up, here are a few takeaways

768
00:46:59,346 --> 00:47:00,827
from the Breach experimentation

769
00:47:00,847 --> 00:47:02,028
I would like to share with you.

770
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:07,310
First, I firmly believe it is absolutely possible

771
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:08,711
to innovate and experiment

772
00:47:08,771 --> 00:47:10,932
within an already established franchise

773
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:12,613
without betraying it.

774
00:47:13,053 --> 00:47:15,975
If you know exactly what your core pillars are,

775
00:47:16,435 --> 00:47:18,176
especially in the mind of your players,

776
00:47:18,976 --> 00:47:21,178
and you are able to think of new ways

777
00:47:21,238 --> 00:47:22,698
to express those pillars.

778
00:47:25,443 --> 00:47:28,024
then you don't have to reinvent the wheel

779
00:47:28,324 --> 00:47:30,085
and rethink all your core mechanics.

780
00:47:31,065 --> 00:47:32,926
By using them as building blocks

781
00:47:32,966 --> 00:47:34,586
that you twist a little bit

782
00:47:34,686 --> 00:47:37,147
and present in a different way to your players,

783
00:47:37,527 --> 00:47:39,387
you can create a whole new experience.

784
00:47:42,328 --> 00:47:44,949
But the way you deliver and communicate

785
00:47:45,069 --> 00:47:46,989
about that new experience matters.

786
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:51,111
And know where are the limits of your fan base

787
00:47:51,691 --> 00:47:54,151
and whether they are ready to accept or not.

788
00:47:55,176 --> 00:47:58,385
Again, I think if Breach had been a stand-alone free-to-play

789
00:47:58,425 --> 00:48:01,453
game from the beginning, the reception from our players

790
00:48:01,794 --> 00:48:03,198
would have been very different.

791
00:48:06,625 --> 00:48:08,846
So this concludes my presentation today.

792
00:48:09,927 --> 00:48:12,049
Before taking questions, if you have any,

793
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:16,432
I would like to give a big shout out to my team,

794
00:48:17,172 --> 00:48:18,233
part of which you can see

795
00:48:18,894 --> 00:48:21,696
in this very cheesy heart-shaped picture.

796
00:48:21,716 --> 00:48:26,259
I would like to thank them for the three

797
00:48:26,799 --> 00:48:29,702
pretty awesome years that we spent together

798
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:32,203
making a pretty awesome game.

799
00:48:41,789 --> 00:48:50,533
Thank you. If you have any questions, I think there are mics there. Just go and ask away.

800
00:48:51,953 --> 00:48:58,676
Hi. I was wondering how did you manage the switch from being a game mode to a free-to-play?

801
00:48:58,816 --> 00:49:04,098
There are many big challenges with the team or the system.

802
00:49:05,005 --> 00:49:07,466
Absolutely not, because the free-to-play,

803
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:11,328
standalone version of Breach is actually

804
00:49:13,049 --> 00:49:16,771
collection of everything we had made so far for the game.

805
00:49:17,171 --> 00:49:19,353
And we released it on Steam only.

806
00:49:20,193 --> 00:49:23,735
So it was really easy to do, and we didn't touch

807
00:49:24,436 --> 00:49:27,537
at all the economic model or anything.

808
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:30,059
We just wanted to give the opportunity

809
00:49:30,899 --> 00:49:33,661
to players who didn't buy Mankind Divided

810
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:34,101
to play it.

811
00:49:34,521 --> 00:49:43,623
play breach. So with the community reception of the microtransactions not being very

812
00:49:43,663 --> 00:49:49,524
positive, how do you see that carry over to some of the behaviors within it? Like do you see

813
00:49:49,564 --> 00:49:54,586
certain noticeable groups of players still engaged with the microtransactions? But that

814
00:49:55,246 --> 00:49:56,866
could be grouped separately somehow?

815
00:50:00,588 --> 00:50:03,629
So we have the most active,

816
00:50:03,929 --> 00:50:06,310
like we still have a community of players

817
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:08,650
who became very active and who have like

818
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:10,851
recorded tons of videos and how-tos

819
00:50:10,891 --> 00:50:12,471
and post on the forums all the time.

820
00:50:12,831 --> 00:50:14,492
A tiny community, I must say.

821
00:50:16,112 --> 00:50:18,733
And they don't engage a lot with the microtransactions.

822
00:50:18,913 --> 00:50:20,734
But it's not a surprise because, again,

823
00:50:20,994 --> 00:50:23,495
we were so careful in the economic design.

824
00:50:23,515 --> 00:50:24,995
I mean, you really want,

825
00:50:25,715 --> 00:50:28,136
you need to want to give us your money to do it.

826
00:50:28,196 --> 00:50:30,157
I mean, there is really no other thing.

827
00:50:31,382 --> 00:50:31,982
Okay, thanks.

828
00:50:34,424 --> 00:50:35,164
Hi there.

829
00:50:35,405 --> 00:50:38,907
So I counted about 30 people inside of the LiveOps team.

830
00:50:39,127 --> 00:50:40,088
Yeah.

831
00:50:40,728 --> 00:50:42,590
I just wanted to ask exactly how many of those

832
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:46,332
were level designers and gameplay programmers

833
00:50:46,352 --> 00:50:48,954
and sort of the guys that were making the content.

834
00:50:50,355 --> 00:50:52,977
So I'm not gonna get into very specific numbers

835
00:50:53,317 --> 00:50:54,898
because I don't think I have the right to.

836
00:50:56,099 --> 00:50:59,502
But so what you have to understand is that that picture

837
00:51:01,383 --> 00:51:05,666
is both the Breach team and the team

838
00:51:05,766 --> 00:51:07,007
that was making the DLCs.

839
00:51:07,467 --> 00:51:12,510
Some of those people were working on both,

840
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:15,172
like our programmers, for instance,

841
00:51:16,032 --> 00:51:17,934
but the level designers and the artists

842
00:51:18,054 --> 00:51:21,236
were separated into people working on Breach

843
00:51:21,296 --> 00:51:22,436
and people working on DLCs.

844
00:51:23,217 --> 00:51:33,543
And so on Breach we had two main level designers who made kind of all of the

845
00:51:33,743 --> 00:51:39,867
majority of the levels with a bit more people chiming. And as far as gameplay

846
00:51:39,907 --> 00:51:45,491
programmers, well the programming team for the whole life team was about eight

847
00:51:45,571 --> 00:51:46,031
programmers.

848
00:51:48,294 --> 00:51:53,660
I just had one more question as well based around, so I realize you've released the game

849
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:54,681
now as a standalone.

850
00:51:54,902 --> 00:51:55,542
Yeah.

851
00:51:55,903 --> 00:51:59,287
Originally it was kind of a menu option inside of the main game.

852
00:51:59,467 --> 00:51:59,667
Yes.

853
00:51:59,948 --> 00:52:03,952
And I wonder whether you had many metrics on people getting kind of lost about that

854
00:52:03,973 --> 00:52:07,176
because I know some people were confused about what Breach was.

855
00:52:07,957 --> 00:52:12,880
but the fact that it was kind of in that first section of the first splash screen that you have?

856
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:18,023
So, the thing is I don't have metrics about if the people were lost about it.

857
00:52:18,784 --> 00:52:26,188
I know that about 30% of the players of Mankind Divided have played Breach.

858
00:52:26,909 --> 00:52:28,790
That's the one thing I know.

859
00:52:31,131 --> 00:52:39,633
The menu, when you're inside Minekind's menu, it says enter the bridge, I think, the sub

860
00:52:39,653 --> 00:52:44,674
menu. I think if you go in there and you just watch the cinematic, then you kind of understand

861
00:52:44,734 --> 00:52:52,556
what it's about. I don't know. Maybe not. In user testing, nobody ever told us that

862
00:52:52,576 --> 00:52:57,197
they were lost about it. That's just ‑‑ okay. Thanks. Very informative talk.

863
00:52:57,697 --> 00:52:57,997
Thank you.

864
00:52:59,956 --> 00:53:05,644
Hello, I have a question about the avatar vanity items. You said you had some doubts while introducing them

865
00:53:06,064 --> 00:53:08,888
But I saw in the latest update you also introduced some new ones

866
00:53:08,968 --> 00:53:14,815
So I would like to ask you from perspective how successful you say you would say they are or they were they were

867
00:53:15,973 --> 00:53:23,517
Well, they are part of the things that sell the most because they're cool, I think, and

868
00:53:23,557 --> 00:53:25,419
they're cool-looking and people like cool-looking stuff.

869
00:53:25,719 --> 00:53:34,665
But still, again, the overall performance of the monetization of Breach is really low,

870
00:53:34,745 --> 00:53:38,487
so it's not super significant to say that something is more successful than another

871
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:40,929
with tiny numbers like that.

872
00:53:41,789 --> 00:53:42,110
Thank you.

873
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:43,070
Welcome.

874
00:53:44,932 --> 00:53:45,792
Do we have another?

875
00:53:45,812 --> 00:53:53,999
Yes, so you said that there's a DLC team and a breach team.

876
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:56,482
So is DLC a paid?

877
00:53:57,302 --> 00:53:57,502
Yes.

878
00:53:57,743 --> 00:53:59,484
Paid DLC, so is there a possibility

879
00:53:59,504 --> 00:54:01,266
that you take all the bundles

880
00:54:01,326 --> 00:54:04,649
and just make it a paid DLC on top of?

881
00:54:05,289 --> 00:54:12,173
breach so that breach remains free and that everything that you want to add is just one or

882
00:54:12,213 --> 00:54:17,555
two or three payments as DLC and then you don't have microtransactions and then you just

883
00:54:17,615 --> 00:54:22,738
avoid the whole problem and you can totally monetize it as just three options.

884
00:54:22,878 --> 00:54:28,200
That's probably something we should have considered honestly with now.

885
00:54:29,842 --> 00:54:32,807
Seeing it, I would say that we have been very,

886
00:54:33,368 --> 00:54:37,474
probably better for our players and better perceived.

887
00:54:38,796 --> 00:54:39,837
We didn't do it like that.

888
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:44,184
And it's probably too late to change anything about this.

889
00:54:46,727 --> 00:54:49,208
One of the things you guys couldn't have caught in process

890
00:54:49,928 --> 00:54:55,011
if you need to get out of jail free card is that ESPN wrote a

891
00:54:55,231 --> 00:55:01,194
scathing destruction piece about microtransaction economies on

892
00:55:01,314 --> 00:55:05,696
steam that disseminated infinitely broadly and raised the

893
00:55:05,896 --> 00:55:10,398
anger level about microtransactions to so much that

894
00:55:10,798 --> 00:55:11,879
steam had to respond.

895
00:55:15,033 --> 00:55:18,014
Yeah, there were timing issues.

896
00:55:18,134 --> 00:55:21,815
We had very angry YouTubers come at us

897
00:55:22,975 --> 00:55:27,056
with a very loud voice saying not so true stuff.

898
00:55:30,837 --> 00:55:33,698
And we did a lot of concept testing and user research

899
00:55:34,058 --> 00:55:37,659
and we really asked the questions to

900
00:55:38,519 --> 00:55:41,781
fans of Deus Ex about the monetization and stuff

901
00:55:41,821 --> 00:55:43,201
because we wanted to be careful about it.

902
00:55:43,261 --> 00:55:44,902
And again, it wasn't foreseen.

903
00:55:45,763 --> 00:55:48,684
The reaction at release was nothing

904
00:55:48,724 --> 00:55:50,365
like we had anticipated.

905
00:55:50,885 --> 00:55:53,106
We thought there would be a bit of backlash,

906
00:55:53,326 --> 00:55:54,527
but not that amount.

907
00:55:57,368 --> 00:55:58,969
Well, thank you everybody.

908
00:56:02,877 --> 00:56:05,441
And don't forget to fill out your surveys.

909
00:56:05,982 --> 00:56:08,285
I've been asked to remind that of you.

910
00:56:08,725 --> 00:56:09,566
