1
00:00:11,289 --> 00:00:20,635
Talk about kind of how Hollywood employs their techniques in the cinematics world of games.

2
00:00:21,756 --> 00:00:24,818
So I'm a visualization supervisor at the third floor.

3
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,520
Been in the industry for about 13, 14 years now.

4
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:34,084
kind of bounce around between feature films and games

5
00:00:34,184 --> 00:00:38,286
and kind of the trailers or just kind of like

6
00:00:38,306 --> 00:00:42,008
the cinematics promos outside of the in-game cinematics.

7
00:00:42,828 --> 00:00:46,890
But it's really interesting how a lot of what we do

8
00:00:47,511 --> 00:00:50,532
in the big Hollywood large-scale feature films

9
00:00:50,952 --> 00:00:54,394
and kind of trim that down, scale it down

10
00:00:54,634 --> 00:00:58,916
and do it kind of in a really fast, efficient way for games.

11
00:01:00,517 --> 00:01:03,118
So, a little bit about me.

12
00:01:05,679 --> 00:01:08,300
I graduated at Ringling College of Art and Design.

13
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,581
Do we have any Ringling grads here?

14
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:12,261
All right.

15
00:01:12,501 --> 00:01:13,762
We always seem to find each other.

16
00:01:15,322 --> 00:01:24,105
So I went there and kind of took a non-traditional path of breaking into the industry before

17
00:01:24,145 --> 00:01:27,406
going to Ringling, going into Ringling as kind of a non-traditional student.

18
00:01:28,147 --> 00:01:30,488
So I kind of came in with some experience,

19
00:01:31,028 --> 00:01:33,289
which was awesome because I could really focus

20
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:34,710
on what I love to do.

21
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,171
And that was kind of more the animation side of things.

22
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:40,612
During like my junior and senior year,

23
00:01:40,652 --> 00:01:42,873
while we're working kind of in our final projects,

24
00:01:43,914 --> 00:01:46,335
I was able to partner with Real Effects.

25
00:01:46,635 --> 00:01:49,736
At the time they were working on some Looney Tunes shorts.

26
00:01:49,836 --> 00:01:50,736
So that was kind of my...

27
00:01:51,437 --> 00:01:53,459
cutting teeth moment into

28
00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:00,986
Hollywood you could say those were showing on the big screen, so it's pretty cool to work on some really cool iconic

29
00:02:01,627 --> 00:02:02,628
Warner Brothers characters

30
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:08,194
I kind of found my way. I mean you eventually I was gonna end up in

31
00:02:09,094 --> 00:02:11,855
Los Angeles or Hollywood area and

32
00:02:11,975 --> 00:02:16,776
That was always kind of the goal is to get on the big screen and you know get in those big movies

33
00:02:17,857 --> 00:02:21,217
And so I got there and it was really cool

34
00:02:22,218 --> 00:02:27,079
fun process along the way getting to work with some amazing companies and

35
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:31,020
kind of found my niche in the

36
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,901
visualization world and so that kind of

37
00:02:35,362 --> 00:02:40,365
includes more of the previs side all the way into postvis.

38
00:02:40,806 --> 00:02:43,287
Also with some techvis along the way,

39
00:02:43,367 --> 00:02:46,450
but I really found myself enjoying the process

40
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,392
of just storytelling and being involved more

41
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:53,775
with full length sequences rather than just individual shots

42
00:02:53,835 --> 00:02:55,096
that either build up a beat

43
00:02:55,156 --> 00:02:58,018
or small section of the stories.

44
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,602
Kind of a secret if you're in the animation world is you actually

45
00:03:04,622 --> 00:03:09,704
You know previs always seem like a means to an end to get to final animation

46
00:03:10,544 --> 00:03:12,705
but when you're working in previs

47
00:03:13,685 --> 00:03:17,847
and the whole visualization process you kind of get the

48
00:03:18,187 --> 00:03:23,970
direct line of communication to the directors and producers and DPs or cinematographers

49
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,051
and it's really special.

50
00:03:26,131 --> 00:03:29,354
So I didn't really realize it was like a direct line

51
00:03:29,374 --> 00:03:30,035
of communication.

52
00:03:30,055 --> 00:03:31,717
You're working directly with these people.

53
00:03:32,537 --> 00:03:34,239
And so that was, that was really cool.

54
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,702
Cause like the whole process of learning together

55
00:03:37,742 --> 00:03:41,305
and learning with them and exploring basically

56
00:03:41,726 --> 00:03:43,528
what their ideas are in their head

57
00:03:43,588 --> 00:03:45,509
and it really just coming out on the big screen.

58
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:52,111
super rewarding. Much more rewarding than trying to get the eye blinks just right,

59
00:03:52,291 --> 00:04:00,773
which I was in for a while, but still really cool as well. So I kind of always

60
00:04:00,933 --> 00:04:08,495
have enjoyed big large-scale action films and kind of enjoyed kind of the

61
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:15,867
choreographies with certain complex sequences, so complex kind of fight sequences.

62
00:04:16,848 --> 00:04:22,552
More recently, over the past three years, Marvel kind of sunk their teeth in me.

63
00:04:22,612 --> 00:04:27,075
So I've been working with them on some of their larger movies that haven't come out yet.

64
00:04:28,396 --> 00:04:30,778
But so that's a it's a little bit about me.

65
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:35,661
And I kind of found myself again bouncing between

66
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:39,384
either these big movies or some really cool.

67
00:04:40,245 --> 00:04:42,648
action sequences in games as well.

68
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:48,795
And some of those games include Apex Legends.

69
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:52,901
I was a huge fan of Halo,

70
00:04:53,301 --> 00:04:56,605
and so I got to work on Bungie's collaboration

71
00:04:56,946 --> 00:04:58,327
on Destiny and Destiny 2.

72
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:06,075
And then a really special project that kind of I don't even know how it landed on my lap was with Gears of War 5

73
00:05:07,396 --> 00:05:10,238
And it was just kind of like a trailer promo thing

74
00:05:11,119 --> 00:05:14,742
Actually ended up winning some awards, which is again like nothing

75
00:05:14,762 --> 00:05:20,307
I really would have found myself thinking I was going to be doing but very cool nonetheless

76
00:05:21,528 --> 00:05:24,670
So again, I work for the third floor.

77
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,331
I've been with them for about five years.

78
00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:30,472
And the third, little bit about the third floor,

79
00:05:30,532 --> 00:05:34,154
we are one of the largest visualization studios

80
00:05:34,194 --> 00:05:34,594
in the world.

81
00:05:35,455 --> 00:05:39,617
And they've really kind of found the specialty

82
00:05:39,697 --> 00:05:41,398
in the visualization process.

83
00:05:42,098 --> 00:05:43,819
That's kind of really what they've honed in on.

84
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:51,363
So, you know, long story short is like that they are more into the storytelling aspect

85
00:05:51,403 --> 00:05:58,386
or how to get the vision from the director out onto into the 3D world most of the time

86
00:05:58,506 --> 00:06:01,588
or into, you know, a previous format.

87
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:06,671
And that is really hard sometimes.

88
00:06:06,731 --> 00:06:09,832
It's kind of, we kind of describe Previs

89
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:13,354
as more like the blueprint foundation building

90
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:16,355
for the final look of the film or the game.

91
00:06:16,996 --> 00:06:17,116
And...

92
00:06:17,656 --> 00:06:21,180
They do, they're spread across a whole bunch of different mediums.

93
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:28,328
So you got your film, you got TV and the episodics and the games, the themed entertainment, big

94
00:06:28,368 --> 00:06:30,350
into the AR and the VR commercials.

95
00:06:30,771 --> 00:06:33,934
So a whole bunch of just different mediums that they're spread across.

96
00:06:34,996 --> 00:06:40,201
So it's really cool being a part of a studio like this because you can kind of

97
00:06:40,241 --> 00:06:45,166
jump around between all these different mediums if you'd like. Again I said I'm

98
00:06:45,306 --> 00:06:51,312
kind of a sucker for the big action sequences so kind of gravitate towards

99
00:06:51,392 --> 00:06:57,958
those stories. So during that there's a process that we kind of go through so

100
00:06:58,679 --> 00:07:04,229
The whole supervising of visualization includes pretty much all of these processes,

101
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:08,696
sometimes depending on what the project is, just small sections of it.

102
00:07:10,076 --> 00:07:17,719
A lot of times for the bigger projects or projects that need a little bit more help

103
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:23,222
in the development stages, we'll start actually doing everything.

104
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:28,584
So taking a script, breaking it down, going into the storyboard process, creating animatics,

105
00:07:28,904 --> 00:07:34,386
going into then the previs and the layout, and that might include working in the virtual

106
00:07:34,426 --> 00:07:35,247
production side.

107
00:07:36,107 --> 00:07:38,788
If they don't have anything that they, you know...

108
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,350
that they didn't know they needed just a sentence,

109
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,671
but that sentence is supposed to be

110
00:07:42,751 --> 00:07:44,793
like a two minute action sequence.

111
00:07:44,853 --> 00:07:48,015
We'll do some pitch viz for them, throw some ideas out.

112
00:07:48,896 --> 00:07:52,919
So super collaborative, very fun process

113
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,842
because we're kind of literally in the creation side

114
00:07:56,902 --> 00:07:59,944
with all of the people that are creating this, so.

115
00:08:00,905 --> 00:08:09,447
The third floor has been around for over 15 years now, so kind of well known in the visualization

116
00:08:09,487 --> 00:08:10,087
side of things.

117
00:08:10,787 --> 00:08:18,289
And a fun little fact is that finally, after all these years, the third floor is going

118
00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:25,771
to be announcing, probably pretty soon, more openly that they're going to move into TTF

119
00:08:25,891 --> 00:08:26,411
animation.

120
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:30,214
as well, but that's a little bit more

121
00:08:31,435 --> 00:08:34,077
kind of specialized animation

122
00:08:34,798 --> 00:08:37,660
where they're kind of taking this virtual production

123
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,884
in real time, rendering, and kind of combining that

124
00:08:41,944 --> 00:08:43,165
into an animation pipeline.

125
00:08:44,546 --> 00:08:48,369
So, this is a little kind of sizzle promo reel

126
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:51,091
for the third floor, just kind of help you

127
00:08:51,612 --> 00:08:52,933
see some of the work we've been working on.

128
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:21,807
Cool.

129
00:11:24,632 --> 00:11:28,855
Some pretty, I'm sure, well-known stuff there.

130
00:11:29,976 --> 00:11:34,220
So fun projects that we've been able to be involved in.

131
00:11:36,481 --> 00:11:39,043
These are just some of the select game titles

132
00:11:39,183 --> 00:11:40,324
that we saw up there.

133
00:11:40,905 --> 00:11:44,708
Again, specifically I was involved in Destiny,

134
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,130
Destiny 2, Apex, Legends, and Gears 5.

135
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:52,734
All kind of fun, super fun projects to collaborate with.

136
00:11:53,655 --> 00:12:02,441
And so I wanted to kind of use Apex Legends as a little case study to kind of show this

137
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:10,607
process of how we kind of take some concepts from our Hollywood type films and how we kind

138
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:18,873
of take those really just tools and technology into doing it in a schedule that is a little

139
00:12:18,893 --> 00:12:21,715
bit more appropriate for games and game cinematics.

140
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:29,519
So, but to be honest with you, it's nothing new in terms of storytelling.

141
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:32,861
That's all kind of still the same as like trying to get that.

142
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:37,043
That's always kind of what we're striving for is like the clearest, most compelling,

143
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,425
entertaining stories that we can tell.

144
00:12:40,605 --> 00:12:41,926
And it's just kind of using...

145
00:12:42,727 --> 00:12:49,333
kind of tips, tricks, and tools, and workflow, and pipeline to get that all into the story.

146
00:12:49,854 --> 00:12:57,521
So Apex Legends specifically, the stories of the Outlands with Pathfinder.

147
00:12:58,422 --> 00:13:00,866
And this one was called Fight Night.

148
00:13:01,306 --> 00:13:03,349
So we'll take a quick peek here.

149
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:07,835
This is kind of examples of how our previs looked,

150
00:13:07,915 --> 00:13:09,096
kind of more in the rougher,

151
00:13:09,397 --> 00:13:12,581
or kind of some rough stages to the final previs

152
00:13:12,962 --> 00:13:14,384
compared to the final.

153
00:13:15,704 --> 00:13:16,765
look of the short.

154
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:22,527
And so the short was about, I believe, about seven minutes.

155
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:25,188
So that's basically just like a short story,

156
00:13:26,289 --> 00:13:29,090
with seven minutes in a sequence that's pretty long,

157
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,810
especially even for a feature film,

158
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,191
a sequence that's like seven minutes long

159
00:13:32,231 --> 00:13:35,452
can be kind of a longer, kind of intense sequence.

160
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:38,733
So just wanted to kind of share this

161
00:13:39,514 --> 00:13:41,735
little segment example here.

162
00:15:13,228 --> 00:15:19,931
So you'll notice a lot of the previz looks very similar to the finals.

163
00:15:19,991 --> 00:15:23,752
That's kind of our job.

164
00:15:24,152 --> 00:15:29,294
As the visualization process kind of evolves, that's literally the goal.

165
00:15:29,374 --> 00:15:35,276
So if you're seeing a one-to-one match from the previz to the finals, that's because we

166
00:15:35,296 --> 00:15:36,176
did our jobs well.

167
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,957
That doesn't always happen.

168
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:41,218
And sometimes it is...

169
00:15:41,818 --> 00:15:47,540
you know, there's improvements that come out into the finals that we just didn't either

170
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:52,821
have time or there are very small subtleties that happen, but for the most part that's

171
00:15:52,841 --> 00:15:57,443
what we're striving for because that's the foundation and definitely the core of what

172
00:15:57,803 --> 00:15:58,943
the final shot's going to look like.

173
00:15:59,884 --> 00:16:05,967
A lot of the visualization, the previous side of things is really just getting the approval,

174
00:16:06,207 --> 00:16:11,830
to be honest, with how this shot is going to be broken down, the amount of work that's

175
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:16,472
going to go into the finals, the level of effects, the look, the polish, the finish,

176
00:16:16,512 --> 00:16:17,052
all that stuff.

177
00:16:17,572 --> 00:16:23,817
So a lot of that is then tied in with the story and the storytelling.

178
00:16:24,177 --> 00:16:32,844
So is the story, you know, process, the process of telling the story for it to be very clear, compelling, entertaining, fun.

179
00:16:33,224 --> 00:16:38,228
So also, so we're going to kind of go into this like breaking it down a little bit.

180
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:43,972
So kind of get a little bit into the nuts and bolts of what this looks like, a little bit more like behind the scenes stuff.

181
00:16:46,514 --> 00:16:54,303
But specifically for a lot of these Apex Legends shorts that we did, we worked with the director,

182
00:16:54,343 --> 00:17:00,550
David Lawson, and also Alicia Thompson was a co-director on it, so kind of just shout out to her as well.

183
00:17:01,611 --> 00:17:06,874
super fun collaborative couple that you kind of work with a studio that's kind

184
00:17:06,914 --> 00:17:14,438
of leading the whole story aspect of it. So in this example is the kind of studio

185
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:20,441
that was over everything was EA and then EA kind of filtered down and the finals

186
00:17:20,461 --> 00:17:23,783
house that third floor collaborated with was The Mill.

187
00:17:24,224 --> 00:17:28,148
and the mill did a lot of the actual finals work on these.

188
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:32,253
And so the mill was really

189
00:17:33,615 --> 00:17:37,499
kind of guiding the whole process for pre-vis

190
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:41,244
and working, so I had my team at the third floor

191
00:17:41,424 --> 00:17:44,007
and we were working with this creative director.

192
00:17:44,728 --> 00:17:54,158
And so the very similar in the Hollywood setup where you are, you know, third floor is kind of contracted to work with a larger studio

193
00:17:54,899 --> 00:18:02,408
and the larger studio has a director and then they have their team of producers and, you know, creatives that are also making these decisions.

194
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,731
So VFX supervisor, editor, and DP.

195
00:18:05,971 --> 00:18:11,733
And so that's kind of the relationship of kind of how we craft these things.

196
00:18:13,313 --> 00:18:18,294
So, you know, again, that's very similar to how we do things in Hollywood.

197
00:18:18,995 --> 00:18:24,076
And it's just taking their vision and bringing it to life.

198
00:18:24,956 --> 00:18:26,598
And so this one specifically,

199
00:18:26,618 --> 00:18:30,321
in the visualization process was well over 200 shots

200
00:18:31,682 --> 00:18:33,563
and just about seven and a half minute sequence.

201
00:18:34,244 --> 00:18:37,346
And so the previous process for this

202
00:18:37,426 --> 00:18:39,228
or giving the finals everything that they need,

203
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:41,550
we took, it took us about five weeks to do that.

204
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,972
So for a seven minute sequence,

205
00:18:43,992 --> 00:18:46,954
that's kind of a lot of shots that were produced

206
00:18:47,094 --> 00:18:48,175
over that period of time.

207
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:49,957
So a lot of iterative process

208
00:18:49,997 --> 00:18:52,258
and a lot of shot progression along the way.

209
00:18:53,099 --> 00:19:02,391
Here's some stunt viz choreography that was used actually to help kind of start the process

210
00:19:02,771 --> 00:19:06,295
and get the pre-viz actually going.

211
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:08,278
So a lot of times they'll give us maybe...

212
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:12,061
a storyboard or something to start with.

213
00:19:12,981 --> 00:19:16,744
But in order to get really complicated action

214
00:19:16,884 --> 00:19:17,905
going pretty quickly,

215
00:19:17,965 --> 00:19:20,947
we gotta actually either block things in

216
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:26,652
or go into an actual kind of real world setting

217
00:19:27,752 --> 00:19:30,494
and work with someone who is actually

218
00:19:30,534 --> 00:19:31,535
gonna shoot this thing,

219
00:19:31,936 --> 00:19:34,858
the way that they wanna see it being shot

220
00:19:35,118 --> 00:19:36,719
and just really kind of get that

221
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,361
process, the iterative process going sooner than later.

222
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:48,162
A lot of it has to do with setting up the timing, the pacing, and what exactly we're

223
00:19:48,182 --> 00:19:52,323
trying to tell in this short period of time that this action sequence is going.

224
00:19:52,343 --> 00:19:59,305
So here's an example of how kind of sometimes stunt viz will come into play and start the

225
00:19:59,345 --> 00:20:00,165
pre-viz process.

226
00:20:19,804 --> 00:20:28,151
So it was really quick, let me just see if I can play that again and just mute the audio here.

227
00:20:42,853 --> 00:20:46,175
You'll see there on the left, the storyboards,

228
00:20:46,215 --> 00:20:47,917
kind of picture in picture with the stunt viz.

229
00:20:49,198 --> 00:20:52,800
A lot of times, we'll go on set and work with,

230
00:20:54,402 --> 00:20:57,244
if there is a specific choreographer that's

231
00:20:57,264 --> 00:20:59,225
kind of setting up these fight sequences,

232
00:20:59,566 --> 00:21:01,908
the director is obviously usually heavily involved.

233
00:21:03,109 --> 00:21:10,416
but they'll have the stunt choreographer work with the stunt actors and they'll just act out these scenes.

234
00:21:10,897 --> 00:21:16,542
A lot of that is, you know, they'll have a general idea of how the sequence is going to break down,

235
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:23,149
or who's going to end up with the weapon, or who's going to get the upper hand, or who's going to get beaten up.

236
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:30,014
But along that way, there's just a lot of just exploration and experimentation in the action.

237
00:21:30,974 --> 00:21:35,337
And then the director's job is just how do we shoot that in a really cool, compelling, interesting way.

238
00:21:36,438 --> 00:21:40,501
And so during that process, then we see it live.

239
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:48,044
most times and a director, if they have a motion capture suit on, we're just capturing

240
00:21:48,084 --> 00:21:52,986
that motion, we can just throw it on a generic rig or if we have rigs ready to go with the

241
00:21:53,066 --> 00:21:57,588
actual characters, that kind of helps the director sometimes who's not as familiar with

242
00:21:59,008 --> 00:22:00,609
3D, can visualize that.

243
00:22:02,189 --> 00:22:09,292
But it could just very well be real live people and he's just framing up shots.

244
00:22:10,753 --> 00:22:14,958
Passing that into Previs, we will then take that data,

245
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:17,181
that motion capture data, or just the reference

246
00:22:17,261 --> 00:22:22,027
from that stunt, StuntViz, and we'll start creating

247
00:22:22,227 --> 00:22:24,449
the Previs, so getting the 3D cameras in there

248
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:27,273
and figuring out the staging, the composition.

249
00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:30,255
the timing, the pacing, all that fun stuff.

250
00:22:31,436 --> 00:22:36,160
But it really is instrumental in building the shots basically.

251
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:39,702
And a lot of continuity comes into play.

252
00:22:39,742 --> 00:22:43,565
A lot of all the technical stuff that you,

253
00:22:43,585 --> 00:22:46,527
it starts to add up to where this is very clear now

254
00:22:46,607 --> 00:22:49,289
what this action is supposed to tell.

255
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,472
Action can get really messy, really busy.

256
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:54,353
Fun little fact.

257
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:58,617
So David, the creative director on this one,

258
00:22:58,998 --> 00:23:01,480
we found ourselves kind of in the editing bay,

259
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,562
which is pretty common, just they're cutting this.

260
00:23:03,943 --> 00:23:08,107
And we both kind of fancy Michael Bay's big action stuff.

261
00:23:09,348 --> 00:23:11,951
Kind of hard not to being in loving action.

262
00:23:12,832 --> 00:23:14,193
And we just spent like...

263
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:20,396
at least 15-20 minutes quoting The Rock back and forth to each other is pretty funny.

264
00:23:21,536 --> 00:23:28,359
It was a fun process because we could kind of take, you know, something that,

265
00:23:28,939 --> 00:23:33,801
an editing process that can get pretty mundane and just kind of...

266
00:23:34,841 --> 00:23:41,604
keep it real and just have fun ideas and try things that I don't think any of us would have been like,

267
00:23:41,644 --> 00:23:49,628
let's go from this right from the beginning. But it's fun to see how their vision actually

268
00:23:49,648 --> 00:23:59,872
evolves along the way. So basically, I'm sure without a doubt, you've seen how over this past

269
00:24:00,412 --> 00:24:03,314
decade, especially over the past couple of years, how

270
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:13,661
All of what we're doing in Hollywood is really combining into video games and vice versa.

271
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:22,163
It's really cool to see how the progression goes and directing and cinematography.

272
00:24:24,224 --> 00:24:32,875
kind of being gelled into these games and games kind of becoming a longer form version of a film.

273
00:24:34,076 --> 00:24:38,942
Something that I was always interested in in games was the whole story, the whole

274
00:24:39,503 --> 00:24:44,691
kit and caboodle of how this beginning you start as this character and go all the way

275
00:24:45,132 --> 00:24:48,697
to the end in the game and this whole story that evolved along the way.

276
00:24:48,777 --> 00:24:54,005
Most films only last a couple hours, unless it's Lord of the Rings it's like days, but

277
00:24:54,967 --> 00:24:58,749
you could be immersed in a game for a lot longer than a film.

278
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:03,451
And the more sophisticated

279
00:25:03,551 --> 00:25:06,793
storytelling in games are so interesting.

280
00:25:07,553 --> 00:25:13,056
And it's it's not the simplified just hit you over the head with,

281
00:25:13,416 --> 00:25:14,957
you know, this is the story point.

282
00:25:14,997 --> 00:25:16,838
This is the you know, this is what's going to happen.

283
00:25:17,239 --> 00:25:25,349
But if you were able to bring in like a film language into these games and have the opportunity

284
00:25:25,369 --> 00:25:30,315
to kind of have like a this idea of showing the audience rather than just telling the

285
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:35,161
audience what they're supposed to know was always kind of interesting to me as well as the.

286
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:42,288
The same way that a prologue to a film would open up and give you like little hints of what's going to come in the film.

287
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:52,377
Like the opening to Seven was like one of my favorite sequences where you get all this like detail about the killer and stuff in the film.

288
00:25:53,137 --> 00:26:01,805
And it was just really interesting. You get those opportunities more so in games to do in trailers and prologues and the cut scenes of course.

289
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:10,369
And then of course the audio you've kind of seen over the past decade too is, you know,

290
00:26:10,409 --> 00:26:15,471
the go-to kind of celebrities or kind of like famous people for voiceovers and, you know,

291
00:26:15,571 --> 00:26:20,292
have all these epic scores that are just so awesome in the games.

292
00:26:21,993 --> 00:26:25,197
Same thing that we're creating in Hollywood,

293
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:28,901
these really high-end type of entertainment opportunities.

294
00:26:28,982 --> 00:26:33,367
So that's definitely something that's been coming to the forefront more recently,

295
00:26:33,387 --> 00:26:34,588
and it's pretty cool.

296
00:26:35,109 --> 00:26:38,573
Here's some just quick examples.

297
00:26:59,197 --> 00:27:03,141
So again, you'll see a lot of the previs matching the finals.

298
00:27:04,743 --> 00:27:10,008
Big part of that is just the timing of the staging, the blocking, the composition.

299
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:16,034
So a lot of that is important because once you hand that off to like the finals.

300
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:23,056
team, it is, it's kind of like putting the stamp on it to say, hey, this is basically

301
00:27:23,076 --> 00:27:28,097
what we're going to use in the cut for now and move it along to the final piece.

302
00:27:29,997 --> 00:27:36,499
And so there could be a time where it, you know, usually kind of hands off to the finals.

303
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:39,340
It's pretty rare that it'll come back just because of the schedules.

304
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:45,881
But in, if you were doing this in Hollywood the same way that if.

305
00:27:46,422 --> 00:27:51,263
something isn't quite working or they show a test screening to a director and

306
00:27:52,043 --> 00:27:55,124
You know something about it just isn't right or needs improvement

307
00:27:55,865 --> 00:27:59,806
It might come back then for another process or go into reshoots

308
00:28:00,326 --> 00:28:04,107
And so the same thing in games if something isn't quite right

309
00:28:04,127 --> 00:28:10,429
We need to go back into like even back to like stunt viz or some kind of choreography sequence that isn't quite right

310
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,550
and kind of

311
00:28:13,611 --> 00:28:20,315
redo that section. So it's pretty common, but again the end goal is the same. It's just

312
00:28:20,335 --> 00:28:26,620
creating that whole process of making it very clear to the audience and very entertaining

313
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:30,943
at the same time. Here's a couple more examples of that.

314
00:28:49,225 --> 00:28:55,648
So the editing is a pretty big part of this whole process, of course.

315
00:28:57,148 --> 00:29:01,530
And the same way we kind of do this in Hollywood is we kind of start

316
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,231
with a huge amount of shots.

317
00:29:04,611 --> 00:29:04,931
Again, we.

318
00:29:06,012 --> 00:29:10,714
In games, the timeline might just be truncated down a little bit, trimmed down.

319
00:29:11,174 --> 00:29:13,936
So there's pluses and minuses to that.

320
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:20,959
The plus side is you can get to the end result a lot quicker and you don't have to keep drilling

321
00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:22,760
on the same shot over and over and over again.

322
00:29:24,081 --> 00:29:29,323
But definitely taking advantage of this sandbox approach where you have a lot of content to

323
00:29:29,383 --> 00:29:30,904
work with to start building and edit.

324
00:29:31,765 --> 00:29:36,048
and from the very beginning process,

325
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,369
we're fleshing out the edit.

326
00:29:37,389 --> 00:29:41,132
That's kind of like our master reference

327
00:29:41,292 --> 00:29:43,013
that we're always going back to

328
00:29:43,113 --> 00:29:47,117
is just building this edit on top of each other.

329
00:29:47,217 --> 00:29:50,579
So a lot of times an edit may even just start with words

330
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,182
and that's timed out to a soundtrack or some voices

331
00:29:54,943 --> 00:29:58,726
or quickly evolve into storyboards or some concept artwork.

332
00:30:00,046 --> 00:30:02,687
And then once we get into adding motion to it,

333
00:30:02,727 --> 00:30:05,447
that is obviously starting to flesh out more of the timing,

334
00:30:05,507 --> 00:30:08,268
the staging, the compositions of all these shots.

335
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:14,169
But basically it's just fleshing out the whole sequence

336
00:30:14,649 --> 00:30:17,850
as a whole, because we keep looking at everything as a whole

337
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:20,510
and you start breaking that whole sequence down

338
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:21,990
into beats and shots.

339
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:22,350
And so,

340
00:30:25,531 --> 00:30:31,513
Pretty much the final cut of this then is handed off to the finals to finish.

341
00:30:32,293 --> 00:30:37,355
And a lot of the times we supply a lot of the 3D files.

342
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:42,077
So again, that's like a huge heavy lifting in terms of starting the shot.

343
00:30:44,038 --> 00:30:50,420
Even if we're using motion capture data that we kind of start with as temp motion capture data.

344
00:30:51,361 --> 00:30:55,004
Sometimes it's good enough to actually make it into finals,

345
00:30:55,244 --> 00:30:59,388
or we have cleaned it up enough to where if it's in game,

346
00:30:59,408 --> 00:31:02,991
they just use it for finals so that data can sometimes go through.

347
00:31:03,412 --> 00:31:05,293
Sometimes they'll end up taking.

348
00:31:06,895 --> 00:31:11,919
you know, the time to actually do a lot more complicated motion capture shoot.

349
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:20,085
And so some fun opportunities come up if you need motion capture, you need to tell like action on

350
00:31:20,105 --> 00:31:25,929
the fly. Sometimes we'll, as animators, we'll get into the suits and act some of these things out

351
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,911
and take that animation.

352
00:31:29,652 --> 00:31:34,994
add it to these characters and every once in a while you could be a character in a game

353
00:31:35,034 --> 00:31:38,936
and get all the way to the finals and that would be you up on the screen.

354
00:31:39,376 --> 00:31:45,939
So it's a cool, it's a fun little aspect to the visualization process as well and another

355
00:31:46,499 --> 00:31:47,760
kind of fun process too.

356
00:31:51,561 --> 00:31:54,444
is again, like working with all these different types

357
00:31:54,484 --> 00:31:59,208
of directors, you have the ability to just kind of

358
00:31:59,248 --> 00:32:04,432
spitball ideas and really take the essence

359
00:32:04,472 --> 00:32:07,555
of what they're trying to tell the audience

360
00:32:07,975 --> 00:32:11,778
and either enhance it or maybe something

361
00:32:11,798 --> 00:32:15,141
the director might not have thought of that you can add to.

362
00:32:16,382 --> 00:32:21,167
Or, you know, you come up with ideas, your team comes up with ideas, and it gets the

363
00:32:21,288 --> 00:32:25,792
director all excited to kind of take that idea and, you know, turn it into something

364
00:32:25,812 --> 00:32:26,113
different.

365
00:32:26,133 --> 00:32:31,318
So there's all these alternate shots that come up along the way, and that's...

366
00:32:32,419 --> 00:32:38,126
Honestly that's like one of the most fun processes is to just you know have the

367
00:32:38,146 --> 00:32:42,290
director say hey we trust you just just you know do something really cool with

368
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:46,695
this sequence and it's really rewarding to to have that opportunity because

369
00:32:46,755 --> 00:32:50,479
you're literally influencing the final look of the film.

370
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:58,666
A lot of final vendors or VFX houses kind of sometimes get a little upset at third floor

371
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:03,230
just because it's the director, producers are always just like, just match the previs,

372
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,130
just match the previs.

373
00:33:04,311 --> 00:33:09,655
And so it's hard for them to get as creative when we have it all worked out.

374
00:33:10,235 --> 00:33:13,398
But again, that's literally our jobs is to do that.

375
00:33:13,478 --> 00:33:18,822
So once it gets to the finals, it becomes a lot more streamlined, straightforward.

376
00:33:19,783 --> 00:33:26,265
To be honest, that's a lot of money saved in the end, because if you're trying to figure

377
00:33:26,305 --> 00:33:29,786
all that out in finals, it's usually going to cost a lot more.

378
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:38,048
It also can lower the quality because if you're not able to iterate as fast and you're not

379
00:33:38,188 --> 00:33:44,330
able to get interesting, compelling stuff that the director actually wants and you're

380
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,411
kind of just having to...

381
00:33:46,411 --> 00:33:49,694
pick away at little things along the way, it ends up costing more money.

382
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:57,242
And so that's that's literally our job is to try to get it to finals as quickly as possible.

383
00:33:58,943 --> 00:34:02,867
So here's some just alt shots, alternative shots,

384
00:34:03,468 --> 00:34:07,431
examples of kind of just showing the iterative process.

385
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:50,611
So, there's obviously way more than three versions of that, but that was just kind of

386
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:53,692
an example of kind of how shot progression can take place.

387
00:34:53,712 --> 00:35:00,294
And you know, you kind of saw the first version as more like the vanilla version of this is

388
00:35:00,474 --> 00:35:01,374
the idea, right?

389
00:35:01,394 --> 00:35:04,955
So the Pathfinder is just shooting his grappling hook out to kind of...

390
00:35:05,575 --> 00:35:08,856
save himself from falling off the ship and it slowly just involved

391
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:13,637
uh in you know the camera to kind of work with the action and the motion to

392
00:35:13,897 --> 00:35:20,479
to rotate and tilt um and so that was uh kind of a small example of how

393
00:35:21,279 --> 00:35:26,360
a simple kind of shot idea progressed into something a little bit more

394
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:29,541
interesting and entertaining especially involving

395
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:33,482
the the grappling hook um here's a another example

396
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:09,514
So again, a lot of subtleties in this, but kind of necessary in a way for it to be clear and arguably better.

397
00:36:10,494 --> 00:36:18,517
So just small tweaks to how the robot is going to attack from a punch to a kick, the timing, the slight angles of the camera,

398
00:36:20,038 --> 00:36:22,198
and, you know, basically how to set that.

399
00:36:22,659 --> 00:36:27,686
idea up for the kind of the best way to tell that part of the story.

400
00:36:28,627 --> 00:36:35,738
But that's those are small examples of how things can get worked out in the progression of the shot.

401
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:43,064
I mean, again, it kind of just goes back down to what the original idea was, the storyboard

402
00:36:43,084 --> 00:36:45,666
in most cases, and getting it into 3D.

403
00:36:46,526 --> 00:36:53,971
Once you get into 3D, a lot of the real technical issues of the clarity starts to get worked

404
00:36:54,071 --> 00:36:58,354
out just naturally because you need to have a camera that has a lensing on it.

405
00:36:59,695 --> 00:37:04,477
and in order to have that story make sense in depth,

406
00:37:05,417 --> 00:37:08,639
all those technical aspects just come into play.

407
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:13,241
And so here's another example of that.

408
00:37:43,898 --> 00:37:49,440
So again, this one took a lot more than four versions, but you could see how the camera

409
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:54,182
kind of started off flying down into showing this idea that the robot's climbing back up

410
00:37:54,222 --> 00:38:02,306
the ship and kind of showing the state of Pathfinder and turned into a little bit more

411
00:38:02,406 --> 00:38:04,166
interesting shot where it was kind of...

412
00:38:04,967 --> 00:38:11,210
camera starting low, low angle, good angle kind of staging to show how the robot's coming up over

413
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:17,314
the side of the ship. Robot kind of leaned over and setting up a little bit more interesting

414
00:38:17,394 --> 00:38:20,316
like foreground, middle ground, background to kind of tell that story.

415
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,924
So that was basically just small examples of what we're doing with the

416
00:38:26,944 --> 00:38:34,772
director to make the story better. But in specifically taking you know this

417
00:38:35,132 --> 00:38:39,096
concept that a lot of what we're doing in film

418
00:38:40,557 --> 00:38:43,999
and attaching it into more of the game side.

419
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:52,605
We've seen this just over this course of a couple years here now

420
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:55,186
with all these new tools that are coming out,

421
00:38:55,326 --> 00:38:57,328
all of the real-time rendering,

422
00:38:57,348 --> 00:39:02,571
obviously the graphics are just getting insane.

423
00:39:02,671 --> 00:39:06,434
So a lot of all these things are just kind of advancing what we're doing,

424
00:39:06,494 --> 00:39:08,435
just tools to make our jobs easier.

425
00:39:10,036 --> 00:39:15,479
And it's, at the end of the day, it's really just about the entertainment side of things.

426
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:20,981
It's how do we get the level of entertainment, the quality of entertainment to the next level.

427
00:39:22,782 --> 00:39:25,944
And all these advances that are happening seem to be...

428
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:33,514
colliding with each other constantly and being able to leverage real-time

429
00:39:35,377 --> 00:39:42,768
software like Unreal and Epic Games stuff that they're using as well as Unity.

430
00:39:43,689 --> 00:39:49,974
So having these tools to be able to kind of see more of a finals look stuff earlier on

431
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:51,656
is always an advantage.

432
00:39:51,936 --> 00:39:57,201
And so we're able to leverage those the same way we are in a virtual art department for

433
00:39:57,921 --> 00:39:58,382
Hollywood.

434
00:39:59,823 --> 00:40:06,749
And again, it's awesome to be in this era right now for having this.

435
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:10,472
the combination is back and forth between, you know,

436
00:40:10,672 --> 00:40:15,055
storytelling in Hollywood and technology and stuff in games

437
00:40:15,395 --> 00:40:18,797
and having all of that just combined with each other

438
00:40:18,957 --> 00:40:21,399
and then you'd enhance the storytelling in games

439
00:40:21,459 --> 00:40:23,740
and enhance the technology in film.

440
00:40:25,301 --> 00:40:29,904
And it's definitely, you know, an awesome thing where...

441
00:40:30,665 --> 00:40:34,646
At the end of the day, again, I think we're all after the same thing, just having this

442
00:40:35,046 --> 00:40:39,207
really cool experience and this immersive experience and being able to share that with

443
00:40:39,247 --> 00:40:41,227
people is really cool, really fun.

444
00:40:42,688 --> 00:40:49,469
And that is what Third Floor really prides itself on, is really just clear, compelling

445
00:40:50,429 --> 00:40:52,970
entertainment that we're all kind of after.

446
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:59,931
We definitely love working with those studios and companies.

447
00:41:00,612 --> 00:41:02,093
are involved in these kind of projects.

448
00:41:02,173 --> 00:41:06,556
So it's just been a very rewarding experience

449
00:41:06,576 --> 00:41:07,577
to work in both worlds.

450
00:41:07,877 --> 00:41:10,118
And for me personally, it's cool to see

451
00:41:10,198 --> 00:41:15,642
how they are just so interlinked in an awesome way.

452
00:41:17,543 --> 00:41:22,626
If you want more information about the third floor, you can go to this website.

453
00:41:23,826 --> 00:41:26,568
We're just about to wrap up here in a few minutes.

454
00:41:26,768 --> 00:41:30,530
I'll kind of open up for a couple questions, Q&A.

455
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:33,551
I guess there's a breakout room after.

456
00:41:33,571 --> 00:41:42,195
I believe it's S204, so you can head over there if you want to kind of talk more in

457
00:41:42,215 --> 00:41:43,096
depth about any of this.

458
00:41:45,618 --> 00:41:48,220
Thank you so much, and I'll open the floor for Q&A.

459
00:41:48,240 --> 00:42:03,353
If anyone has questions, just come up to the mic at the end of the night.

460
00:42:08,557 --> 00:42:09,498
Hi, thank you for that.

461
00:42:10,818 --> 00:42:16,461
Have you ever had to make changes way later because of technical limits?

462
00:42:16,601 --> 00:42:22,904
Like, for instance, let's say you have a reflection or something that is a very important part of the scene,

463
00:42:23,465 --> 00:42:29,788
and then because of a game setting on PC configuration, for instance, you cannot have reflections, and then...

464
00:42:30,668 --> 00:42:32,229
it changes the meaning of that scene,

465
00:42:33,329 --> 00:42:35,310
it breaks the scene because it can't see the reflection,

466
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:36,870
or something like that, some technical limitation

467
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:39,711
that you had to make changes for.

468
00:42:39,731 --> 00:42:41,692
Yeah, awesome.

469
00:42:41,772 --> 00:42:44,493
So the question was, I'm just kind of repeating this back

470
00:42:44,533 --> 00:42:48,234
for the camera here, is have we had to make changes

471
00:42:48,314 --> 00:42:52,876
later on and kind of go back to kind of reflect those

472
00:42:52,916 --> 00:42:55,456
changes, and a lot of the times in the previous,

473
00:42:55,757 --> 00:43:00,662
process they will weigh that decision based on whether it whether or not it's

474
00:43:00,822 --> 00:43:05,647
it's worth it in their budget to do that. It might just get kicked down as a note

475
00:43:05,727 --> 00:43:11,273
to finals. That's usually the case. But every once in a while if if it's really

476
00:43:11,313 --> 00:43:15,958
important for a screening or for approval then yes we would have to kind

477
00:43:15,998 --> 00:43:16,479
of go back.

478
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:26,426
make that change. Sometimes it's painful where it's involving multiple things that would not make

479
00:43:26,506 --> 00:43:31,769
sense if you're showing it story-wise. So if a character has a helmet on and now they don't

480
00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:36,873
have a helmet on because that was really crucial to the story, again, if it makes sense for them

481
00:43:36,953 --> 00:43:42,837
to go back because if it's not crucial to telling that story or they can do it later, it just makes

482
00:43:42,877 --> 00:43:46,119
more sense to kind of kick that down to a finals note.

483
00:43:52,317 --> 00:43:58,860
Hi there. I was wondering how much of a percentage of game engines are you using for doing this

484
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:06,563
production as opposed to traditional animation software? And secondarily, how much of a change

485
00:44:06,623 --> 00:44:13,386
are you seeing with virtual production and sort of moving to all pre-production? Are you still

486
00:44:13,446 --> 00:44:20,869
doing, you know, pre-visualization as much or are you sort of, how is that changing the

487
00:44:20,889 --> 00:44:21,349
dynamic?

488
00:44:22,204 --> 00:44:33,232
Yeah, so the question is, kind of like the percentage of virtual production being used now and kind of what the future, I guess, is how this is going to look and what we're kind of looking for.

489
00:44:33,252 --> 00:44:44,379
It, I think the our studio specifically is really, really just happy about virtual production and that whole.

490
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:53,463
process and pipeline. Right now it's very, unfortunately it's very budget determined.

491
00:44:53,903 --> 00:45:02,707
So because it's, what we want to do as a studio is make all real-time virtual kind of workflows

492
00:45:02,807 --> 00:45:08,890
work for the project. That's not always the case and that it right now it involves, I won't say

493
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:16,712
twice the amount of work, but it sometimes is twice the amount of resources in a way.

494
00:45:17,532 --> 00:45:25,014
For example, things that we could do, we generally use Maya for our streamlined process of getting

495
00:45:25,074 --> 00:45:27,794
it in 3D.

496
00:45:28,374 --> 00:45:35,556
And then we'll use the Unreal side mostly for the virtual and the real time.

497
00:45:36,136 --> 00:45:39,717
Our goal is to combine the two in a way that is...

498
00:45:40,758 --> 00:45:44,281
Maya is taking advantage of Maya's tools in the best way possible.

499
00:45:45,122 --> 00:45:51,548
Most of the time it's with their animation tools and their kind of quick, easy viewport

500
00:45:51,628 --> 00:45:52,228
navigation.

501
00:45:53,409 --> 00:45:57,553
And then taking advantage of all of Unreal's basically as a render engine.

502
00:45:57,673 --> 00:45:59,995
So all the lighting and the effects.

503
00:46:00,776 --> 00:46:01,977
and all of that would come out of it.

504
00:46:02,037 --> 00:46:06,219
So our ultimate goal is linking the two.

505
00:46:07,899 --> 00:46:10,701
Right now, it's again, project dependent.

506
00:46:10,761 --> 00:46:13,162
So if a project makes sense

507
00:46:13,282 --> 00:46:16,203
where this would iterate better in real time,

508
00:46:17,104 --> 00:46:19,665
there's some aspects that it needs to be

509
00:46:19,745 --> 00:46:20,725
and stay in real time,

510
00:46:21,646 --> 00:46:23,787
just because of interactive lighting

511
00:46:23,887 --> 00:46:26,548
and certain things that they wanna choreograph.

512
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,061
I think our ultimate goal is where we're moving

513
00:46:32,141 --> 00:46:35,143
definitely is going to be all just real time.

514
00:46:36,503 --> 00:46:39,185
Essentially, that was kind of the goal of Viewport 2.0

515
00:46:40,385 --> 00:46:44,027
in a way is just having that real time

516
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:45,808
viewport rendering work for us,

517
00:46:46,128 --> 00:46:47,929
but there's a lot of limitations to that.

518
00:46:48,469 --> 00:46:51,030
Unreal unlocks a lot of things for us to do,

519
00:46:51,791 --> 00:46:54,212
but also there's limitations on the Unreal side.

520
00:46:54,252 --> 00:46:56,473
So, but eventually that's where everything is going.

521
00:46:56,533 --> 00:46:57,493
I think every project.

522
00:46:57,854 --> 00:47:05,581
In the previs, our goal is to make that as efficient as if everything originally stayed in Maya, the old school way.

523
00:47:06,141 --> 00:47:09,745
Percentage-wise, I'm not sure exactly. I mean, it's probably like...

524
00:47:11,306 --> 00:47:14,369
50-50 on the amount of projects we're working on that involve Unreal.

525
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:23,718
And Unreal has just been so awesome to team up with our kind of tech team and our pipeline team.

526
00:47:24,519 --> 00:47:31,266
So a lot of the proprietary tools that we're building in-house and that speak to Unreal and work with Unreal.

527
00:47:31,806 --> 00:47:34,709
basically to make our pipeline just super efficient.

528
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:39,114
That's constantly changing, constantly changing,

529
00:47:39,134 --> 00:47:40,675
especially over the past two years.

530
00:47:41,937 --> 00:47:45,040
But absolutely, I think our goal as a company

531
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:50,065
is to move 100% into every project being real time

532
00:47:50,125 --> 00:47:52,908
and just being able to leverage the best of both worlds.

533
00:47:55,633 --> 00:47:55,933
Hello.

534
00:47:56,293 --> 00:47:57,273
Hi.

535
00:47:57,393 --> 00:48:00,814
You mentioned a little bit about speaking with directors

536
00:48:00,894 --> 00:48:03,375
and the people who are sort of handling the story,

537
00:48:03,475 --> 00:48:04,895
as well as getting things approved.

538
00:48:06,096 --> 00:48:08,256
How much and how is that communication

539
00:48:08,296 --> 00:48:09,076
sort of structured?

540
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,397
Is it a few big meetings, or are you

541
00:48:11,537 --> 00:48:13,577
able to sort of constantly send them?

542
00:48:13,597 --> 00:48:15,818
You showed off the different versions you had of the shots,

543
00:48:15,878 --> 00:48:16,578
and stuff like that.

544
00:48:16,978 --> 00:48:18,739
Are you able to sort of send them constant updates,

545
00:48:18,759 --> 00:48:21,519
or is it bigger meetings to just sort of get all the questions

546
00:48:21,579 --> 00:48:22,140
answered at once?

547
00:48:23,092 --> 00:48:29,293
So the question was kind of how the meetings kind of structured and how that kind of comes

548
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:32,974
into the whole kind of iterative process.

549
00:48:34,275 --> 00:48:41,617
I think that a lot of a lot of the smaller projects will.

550
00:48:42,977 --> 00:48:49,123
help with the meetings to be a little bit more intimate and free-falling. The bigger projects usually involve like a

551
00:48:49,203 --> 00:48:53,187
first major kickoff and they give you as much information as possible.

552
00:48:54,629 --> 00:48:56,070
And in a project like this

553
00:48:56,971 --> 00:48:59,934
Apex, you know Legends project it was it's

554
00:49:00,634 --> 00:49:07,556
It's not as large scale so the teams are kind of smaller which open you know the fact that you can

555
00:49:07,676 --> 00:49:14,538
communicate very quickly and have you know set up meetings very quickly. Most of the time it's

556
00:49:15,318 --> 00:49:23,000
usually involved like a dailies and if it's not a dailies it's like a weeklies like two times a

557
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:23,960
week is pretty common.

558
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:31,204
to kind of check in, but communication is constantly free-flowing. Again, there's things

559
00:49:31,264 --> 00:49:37,528
that they're going to know information-wise that we might not know because of just, it's not ready

560
00:49:37,628 --> 00:49:43,572
to unleash basically into the story yet, and they don't want to like jump the gun and say things.

561
00:49:43,612 --> 00:49:48,034
Sometimes it's the opposite. They just give you a whole bunch of information, the story that's going

562
00:49:48,094 --> 00:49:52,437
to just be wild and crazy, and you're like...

563
00:49:53,057 --> 00:49:55,520
you know, this is a five-week schedule, this isn't going to happen.

564
00:49:56,541 --> 00:50:00,304
And so you're basically kind of figuring out what you can do

565
00:50:00,785 --> 00:50:03,147
during that time and what's feasible.

566
00:50:04,308 --> 00:50:07,832
But the meetings are pretty regular, that's pretty common.

567
00:50:09,193 --> 00:50:11,575
Most of the time you're in direct communication.

568
00:50:12,336 --> 00:50:17,620
with a VFX supervisor or someone who's going to kind of handle the final side of things.

569
00:50:19,201 --> 00:50:21,943
And it's pretty much on a daily basis.

570
00:50:22,823 --> 00:50:23,604
Same with the editor.

571
00:50:23,624 --> 00:50:29,187
The editor is like probably the most important component to it who is like communicating

572
00:50:29,227 --> 00:50:31,769
and they probably have a direct line to the director as well.

573
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:37,833
On Apex Legends I had a direct line to the director so it wasn't that much of an issue

574
00:50:37,873 --> 00:50:39,855
to get information that I needed.

575
00:50:42,795 --> 00:50:46,478
nice thing about the director too is he's very familiar with the 3D side of things so

576
00:50:46,518 --> 00:50:51,161
I could explain things to him in a 3D world that made sense to him.

577
00:50:51,321 --> 00:50:57,625
You don't get that all the time, but he came from like a 3D background so he knew lighting,

578
00:50:57,665 --> 00:51:04,229
he knew Maya, which is, you know, being able to speak that language is very kind of powerful

579
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:04,469
I guess.

580
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:10,573
You get directors that don't know that stuff and you have to kind of figure out different

581
00:51:10,613 --> 00:51:12,454
language of how to explain that to them.

582
00:51:13,615 --> 00:51:21,501
But it is still the same challenge as just being able to communicate clearly and make

583
00:51:21,561 --> 00:51:22,021
sure that

584
00:51:23,202 --> 00:51:25,364
you know, the idea that they're,

585
00:51:25,704 --> 00:51:27,186
whatever kind of vision that they have

586
00:51:27,346 --> 00:51:29,648
is being executed on the creative side.

587
00:51:30,789 --> 00:51:34,272
And so it's also our jobs to communicate back

588
00:51:34,432 --> 00:51:37,055
if something isn't gonna quite work

589
00:51:37,455 --> 00:51:39,337
or if something isn't.

590
00:51:39,897 --> 00:51:41,199
you know, if they didn't, you know,

591
00:51:41,299 --> 00:51:43,501
if it was a challenge that they never even thought of

592
00:51:43,521 --> 00:51:46,904
as a cool idea, but it could just be very well a challenge

593
00:51:46,944 --> 00:51:49,686
that is like, this isn't quite how this is gonna work.

594
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:51,968
And a lot of the time is they'll see something

595
00:51:52,049 --> 00:51:55,532
on a storyboard or concept artwork,

596
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:59,776
and that's not built from 3D, so it's just a 2D image.

597
00:51:59,836 --> 00:52:00,737
And it's like this.

598
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:03,379
is basically impossible to create.

599
00:52:03,419 --> 00:52:06,061
We can make this version because of the way the lensing

600
00:52:06,101 --> 00:52:08,022
and the angles of cameras actually work

601
00:52:09,504 --> 00:52:11,705
and kind of propose those ideas

602
00:52:11,865 --> 00:52:14,708
or just take ideas and influence.

603
00:52:14,748 --> 00:52:18,410
But the communication is, again, really regular.

604
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:22,354
It's always encouraged to ask the questions.

605
00:52:23,174 --> 00:52:26,521
of what's coming a lot sooner than later,

606
00:52:26,541 --> 00:52:28,043
so there's no surprises,

607
00:52:29,025 --> 00:52:33,093
but it's just constantly being in communication.

608
00:52:42,641 --> 00:52:45,864
For cinematics or game cutscenes specifically,

609
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:48,486
do you prefer to start with storyboards

610
00:52:48,706 --> 00:52:49,907
and then move to animatics

611
00:52:50,808 --> 00:52:52,770
or start with a more defined concept art?

612
00:52:54,031 --> 00:52:56,633
Or do you just prefer to work based on the script

613
00:52:56,694 --> 00:52:58,255
and then assign shots to animators

614
00:52:58,395 --> 00:53:00,077
and then just iterate based on that?

615
00:53:01,078 --> 00:53:03,139
Cool, so yeah, the question is kind of like

616
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:05,562
what kind of part of the phase or process

617
00:53:05,582 --> 00:53:06,322
do I like to start?

618
00:53:07,776 --> 00:53:13,263
with first whether that be storyboards or concept art or just nothing blank canvas

619
00:53:14,284 --> 00:53:16,507
it it really kind of depends if it's

620
00:53:18,782 --> 00:53:25,186
If it's a script that I was given or an idea that was given,

621
00:53:26,867 --> 00:53:29,908
if I am very influenced by it

622
00:53:29,949 --> 00:53:32,270
and it's very compelling and interesting,

623
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:34,972
and honestly, if it's something that all of a sudden

624
00:53:35,012 --> 00:53:36,493
starts creating visuals in my head,

625
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:39,134
I really love blank canvas.

626
00:53:39,194 --> 00:53:40,935
It's just like, this is what I see.

627
00:53:40,955 --> 00:53:46,719
A lot of the time that I'm given storyboards,

628
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:53,002
It helps to give me like, oh, this was the idea.

629
00:53:53,042 --> 00:53:54,443
This was the general idea.

630
00:53:54,603 --> 00:53:57,264
There's probably like nine times out of 10,

631
00:53:58,125 --> 00:54:00,306
the storyboards are good, they're working.

632
00:54:01,286 --> 00:54:04,928
But there's always that 10% chance where it's just,

633
00:54:05,328 --> 00:54:08,030
this isn't really that good a composition,

634
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:09,710
or you can tell it was just not,

635
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:10,991
it was kind of an afterthought.

636
00:54:12,733 --> 00:54:16,497
And so storyboards can actually deter you sometimes

637
00:54:16,557 --> 00:54:18,740
in being ultra creative because it's like,

638
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:20,902
okay, this is what's being expected,

639
00:54:20,962 --> 00:54:22,844
so I gotta do something like this.

640
00:54:23,505 --> 00:54:26,849
A lot of the times if I'm seeing something,

641
00:54:26,869 --> 00:54:30,473
an idea that's really awesome, really creative.

642
00:54:31,594 --> 00:54:35,457
I'll just quickly get the storyboard version out and here you go and then just go right

643
00:54:35,497 --> 00:54:40,700
into the alts and say, but we could do this and show them with each other.

644
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,622
And they really like that.

645
00:54:42,662 --> 00:54:46,604
I mean, a lot of the time the directors will expect that from third floor because it's

646
00:54:46,644 --> 00:54:47,885
like this is this is kind of.

647
00:54:48,806 --> 00:54:49,866
what we are known for.

648
00:54:49,987 --> 00:54:54,289
So you have some directors that really know what they want.

649
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:56,511
They want to execute this vision exactly.

650
00:54:56,931 --> 00:54:59,113
So they'll give us exactly what they want.

651
00:54:59,153 --> 00:55:00,714
This is a key frame concept.

652
00:55:00,974 --> 00:55:01,854
Boom, just make that.

653
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:02,755
And that's cool.

654
00:55:02,815 --> 00:55:04,756
Like sometimes it's like super cool

655
00:55:05,537 --> 00:55:07,138
to start on that side of things

656
00:55:07,158 --> 00:55:09,219
because it's like this is literally the image

657
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,041
that's coming out of the director's head

658
00:55:11,061 --> 00:55:13,802
and we just want to create that shot in 3D now.

659
00:55:14,923 --> 00:55:19,605
So, I like to work, to answer the question, I like to work in all parts of the process.

660
00:55:19,705 --> 00:55:23,426
I prefer a blank canvas when it's something that I get inspired to do.

661
00:55:23,966 --> 00:55:31,069
And then if it's something that a director's vision is really powerful, then it's really

662
00:55:31,089 --> 00:55:36,231
cool to kind of make that come to the real life or fruition there.

663
00:55:39,093 --> 00:55:41,153
Hello. Oh, it's pretty loud.

664
00:55:42,054 --> 00:55:46,155
Thanks, Mitch. It was a really cool presentation and really cool to hear about your process.

665
00:55:46,775 --> 00:55:48,935
And I love that you brought up Seven, the opening titles as well.

666
00:55:48,975 --> 00:55:52,997
It's a personal favorite of mine. It's Kyle Cooper at his finest.

667
00:55:53,617 --> 00:55:53,817
Yes.

668
00:55:55,297 --> 00:56:00,739
I was wondering a bit about when you work with sort of cut scenes that happen in the game,

669
00:56:00,759 --> 00:56:05,760
so in between portions of gameplay, how much, if you worked on those scenarios,

670
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:06,720
how much do you work with...

671
00:56:07,541 --> 00:56:11,162
game director and narrative designers to kind of get the pacing in the cutscenes.

672
00:56:11,542 --> 00:56:20,986
You mentioned a lot of your work in the edits and previous kind of getting the right balance.

673
00:56:21,507 --> 00:56:24,728
So do you kind of, when there's proceedings, things happening in gameplay,

674
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:28,790
if there's a lot of action or a slower portion of gameplay,

675
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:33,932
are you involved with the team of what sort of happens?

676
00:56:35,018 --> 00:56:44,821
Yeah, so the question was just like in more focus, I guess, like how this is the this process is involved more in game.

677
00:56:44,921 --> 00:56:50,182
And if I've been involved in that, actually not as much in game.

678
00:56:51,222 --> 00:56:54,883
I guess the closest to that was with Bungie's Destiny.

679
00:56:55,664 --> 00:57:01,505
But it was the same way as you have a creative director at a final studio or a director at a.

680
00:57:02,666 --> 00:57:07,569
You know, big studio, there's like a game director that's directing the game.

681
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:15,273
The same ideas that a director is like, we want to be able to tell this in this story.

682
00:57:16,674 --> 00:57:23,558
So I would take that into just basically, the closest I think, like I said, was with

683
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:26,760
a prologue to Bungie's Destiny.

684
00:57:27,621 --> 00:57:34,727
So it was very similar, you know, the director has a vision and the director wants to actually

685
00:57:34,787 --> 00:57:44,215
have a certain idea in this prologue come out and a lot of what you're showing in a

686
00:57:44,656 --> 00:57:46,277
prologue or in game.

687
00:57:46,777 --> 00:57:52,843
is setting up the tone and setting up basically this narrative that's gonna happen.

688
00:57:52,903 --> 00:57:59,089
So you know, foreshadowing some things and maybe just hinting at future in-game things that are coming.

689
00:57:59,149 --> 00:58:04,974
But it's like working the same way as if it was very similar to a cinematic.

690
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:09,959
The cinematic may be a little bit more freedom and flexibility because a lot of times...

691
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:19,986
The game is in early development or super early stages of development where this promo

692
00:58:20,026 --> 00:58:26,870
or trailer or cinematic really doesn't relate necessarily to gameplay and it gives you a

693
00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:30,293
lot more freedom because you're not locked into, well this is not exactly what it's going

694
00:58:30,313 --> 00:58:31,173
to look like in game.

695
00:58:32,134 --> 00:58:35,497
So it's cool, we can just move these buildings and do stuff over here.

696
00:58:36,338 --> 00:58:42,583
So it definitely offers more freedom and is not as, I guess, just structured in a way

697
00:58:42,643 --> 00:58:45,645
that it has to work and make sense in game.

698
00:58:46,246 --> 00:58:47,527
So I think that's the biggest difference.

699
00:58:49,185 --> 00:58:49,505
Thank you.

700
00:58:49,845 --> 00:58:50,406
Yep, thank you.

701
00:58:50,846 --> 00:58:51,106
Hello.

702
00:58:51,126 --> 00:58:51,647
Hi.

703
00:58:52,127 --> 00:58:53,128
I wanted to ask you,

704
00:58:54,049 --> 00:58:56,631
when you are working with the game studio,

705
00:58:57,011 --> 00:58:59,253
but the one which is not using Unreal,

706
00:58:59,373 --> 00:59:02,756
but for example has his own inside engine,

707
00:59:03,016 --> 00:59:05,078
do you find it in some way more challenging

708
00:59:05,378 --> 00:59:07,420
or it doesn't matter in your work?

709
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,741
Are you saying their own proprietary in-game engine?

710
00:59:08,761 --> 00:59:08,861
Yeah.

711
00:59:08,881 --> 00:59:10,302
Sorry to interrupt here, but the session is over now.

712
00:59:10,322 --> 00:59:16,267
People have to go to a wrap-up room, S204.

713
00:59:18,529 --> 00:59:18,829
That is it.

714
00:59:21,249 --> 00:59:21,550
Awesome.

715
00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:26,475
Fantastic, thank you.

716
00:59:26,495 --> 00:59:27,737
Thank you, everyone.
