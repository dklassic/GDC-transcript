00:00:03,939 --> 00:00:07,703
Good afternoon, and welcome to Realistic Performances and Games.

2
00:00:08,945 --> 00:00:13,930
Fair warning, I have been told this talk is a bit chewy, so strap in.

3
00:00:16,813 --> 00:00:20,537
There is a perception out there that the average game is mindless entertainment,

4
00:00:20,977 --> 00:00:25,322
with at best a thin story, cardboard cutout characters, and stilted acting.

5
00:00:27,153 --> 00:00:30,215
But many companies have been working tirelessly against that stigma.

6
00:00:30,776 --> 00:00:35,400
At Naughty Dog, where I've been for over seven years, we work hard to ensure our performances

7
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:40,524
are believable, emotionally relevant to the player, and blend with our gameplay as seamlessly

8
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:41,125
as possible.

9
00:00:42,886 --> 00:00:47,510
I'm Ryan James, and I work at Naughty Dog in a somewhat unique position, as lead editor.

10
00:00:48,495 --> 00:00:51,098
Aside from writing and directing some of our content,

11
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,240
it's my job to keep the rest of the team,

12
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,081
or to help the rest of the team create

13
00:00:55,282 --> 00:00:57,864
and maintain performances that feel like what you'd expect

14
00:00:57,904 --> 00:01:00,727
from an edited movie, even when they're fully interactive.

15
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:03,769
But what makes a realistic performance?

16
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,952
In Naughty Dog, it means a character needs

17
00:01:06,992 --> 00:01:09,294
to feel vulnerable, nuanced, and human,

18
00:01:10,996 --> 00:01:12,257
which means we're often focused

19
00:01:12,397 --> 00:01:14,039
on how natural every movement feels.

20
00:01:14,814 --> 00:01:17,275
meaning how the character moves and how they speak

21
00:01:17,716 --> 00:01:20,137
needs to feel emotionally and physically relatable.

22
00:01:21,197 --> 00:01:23,198
And of course, they also have to look realistic,

23
00:01:23,578 --> 00:01:25,399
which takes labor from everyone to get right.

24
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:28,841
Which is our entire goal.

25
00:01:29,581 --> 00:01:32,543
Naughty Dog's games strive to intertwine story and gameplay

26
00:01:32,863 --> 00:01:35,564
so the player experiences a seamless performance,

27
00:01:35,865 --> 00:01:38,466
which we call the active cinematic experience.

28
00:01:41,116 --> 00:01:43,717
We like to provide the player with emotional investment

29
00:01:43,797 --> 00:01:46,318
and motivation behind the moment-to-moment gameplay.

30
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:49,700
This is largely done through non-interactive cut scenes,

31
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,261
but because we strive to keep the player in control

32
00:01:52,301 --> 00:01:53,301
as often as possible,

33
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:55,502
a lot of those drama and character moments

34
00:01:55,602 --> 00:01:58,243
end up paying off on the stick, as we call it.

35
00:02:01,282 --> 00:02:02,982
But figuring out which beats belong where

36
00:02:03,422 --> 00:02:04,923
and pulling off the execution of them

37
00:02:05,323 --> 00:02:06,764
requires a lot of iteration.

38
00:02:07,584 --> 00:02:09,905
And at Naughty Dog, one of our biggest strengths

39
00:02:10,085 --> 00:02:13,006
is our willingness to retool or even throw away content,

40
00:02:13,386 --> 00:02:14,786
including captured performances,

41
00:02:15,227 --> 00:02:16,947
if it will make the player's experience better.

42
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:20,608
Even when deadlines are extremely tight,

43
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:23,489
our company culture encourages people to speak up

44
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:24,830
if they think something isn't working

45
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,691
and take advantage of our tools

46
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:29,391
which enable quick alterations to try out new ideas.

47
00:02:30,641 --> 00:02:33,084
This means all of the narrative content that we capture

48
00:02:33,264 --> 00:02:36,248
is prone to changing, even after it goes into the game.

49
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,713
And sometimes, these alterations happen so quickly

50
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:40,895
that their trickle-down effects

51
00:02:40,935 --> 00:02:42,216
get lost in the daily shuffle.

52
00:02:43,793 --> 00:02:47,696
Thus, it is up to the editorial team to constantly chase change,

53
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:50,698
tracking and managing each edited performance

54
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:53,260
in its various evolutions over the course of development,

55
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:56,182
in order to ensure that when the player gets their hands

56
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:58,924
on the game, our characters' interactions still feel

57
00:02:59,204 --> 00:03:01,406
like the authentic human moments we'd intended them

58
00:03:01,446 --> 00:03:02,827
to be when we first captured them.

59
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:07,464
So today I wanted to share some of the techniques we've used

60
00:03:07,844 --> 00:03:09,105
and challenges we've encountered

61
00:03:09,505 --> 00:03:11,566
when creating realistic performances in games

62
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:13,407
while allowing them to change

63
00:03:13,547 --> 00:03:14,528
over the course of development.

64
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:17,249
Oh, and just a heads up,

65
00:03:17,749 --> 00:03:20,090
spoiler warning for most of our games.

66
00:03:24,168 --> 00:03:26,629
Here at Naughty Dog, we don't develop the story second.

67
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:29,309
Since we shoot and implement narrative material

68
00:03:29,369 --> 00:03:32,230
in small batches, capturing progressively with the actors

69
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,510
for easily a year or more, our story in fact comes together

70
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,731
right alongside design.

71
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,691
Of course, it takes many months of pre-production

72
00:03:40,711 --> 00:03:42,032
before we can shoot anything.

73
00:03:42,732 --> 00:03:44,412
Our directors and writers first juggle

74
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,312
developing story macros with design,

75
00:03:46,732 --> 00:03:48,273
overseeing the creation of characters

76
00:03:48,313 --> 00:03:50,053
that offer varied gameplay mechanics,

77
00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:52,453
and casting actors to embody those characters.

78
00:03:53,885 --> 00:03:55,986
But, as soon as we have enough material written,

79
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:58,026
we jump in headfirst with our actors

80
00:03:58,066 --> 00:04:00,147
to capture story beats via motion capture

81
00:04:00,227 --> 00:04:01,107
and dialogue recording.

82
00:04:02,048 --> 00:04:03,948
Often, we focus on a demo of some kind,

83
00:04:04,408 --> 00:04:06,649
a small slice of the game that establishes our tone

84
00:04:07,029 --> 00:04:08,910
and explores the game's developing mechanics.

85
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,250
Right away, the game starts evolving

86
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,451
because of these initial shoots.

87
00:04:14,179 --> 00:04:18,202
Not only do they help our principal actors start infusing their personality into the characters,

88
00:04:18,682 --> 00:04:23,707
but their choices early on allow the team to adapt to discoveries we've made with the actors on the stage.

89
00:04:24,928 --> 00:04:27,630
For instance, on the very first day of shooting The Last of Us,

90
00:04:28,071 --> 00:04:31,694
we began with a scene where Joel and Ellie are ambushed during their cross-country journey.

91
00:04:32,374 --> 00:04:35,697
Ellie was originally pulled from their pickup truck and pinned helplessly by an enemy,

92
00:04:36,077 --> 00:04:38,780
making her a quasi-damsel in distress for Joel to save.

93
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,602
But Ashley Johnson, who plays Ellie,

94
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:44,645
had the desire to fight back against her attacker.

95
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:47,728
So we shot it that way, leading our directors

96
00:04:47,768 --> 00:04:49,731
to go back to design and rethink the character's

97
00:04:49,851 --> 00:04:51,753
overall vulnerability for the rest of the game.

98
00:04:53,135 --> 00:04:55,097
Though we wanted to reinforce the need for the player,

99
00:04:55,317 --> 00:04:57,199
as Joel, to protect Ellie from harm,

100
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,162
it still worked better for her to become

101
00:04:59,262 --> 00:05:01,164
far more capable in combat situations

102
00:05:01,224 --> 00:05:02,365
than we'd originally conceived.

103
00:05:04,517 --> 00:05:07,960
As we continue to shoot, cut scenes are initially our top priority.

104
00:05:08,401 --> 00:05:11,764
Since these are non-interactive beats reserved for the more delicate

105
00:05:11,804 --> 00:05:15,107
and emotional character moments, they require as much animation time

106
00:05:15,147 --> 00:05:17,470
as possible to hit the level of polish required.

107
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,211
We've spoken about our capturing process before,

108
00:05:21,652 --> 00:05:23,894
but there's a couple of things I feel that are essential

109
00:05:23,934 --> 00:05:25,676
to capturing the best performance possible.

110
00:05:26,276 --> 00:05:30,180
Because as an editor, if all I had to start working with

111
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,721
was stale or unnatural material,

112
00:05:32,101 --> 00:05:33,923
there would only be so much we could do in post

113
00:05:34,103 --> 00:05:34,644
to make it better.

114
00:05:36,685 --> 00:05:38,407
A lot goes into how we create scripts

115
00:05:38,767 --> 00:05:40,589
that give actors honest material to play,

116
00:05:40,989 --> 00:05:43,151
but I sadly do not have time to touch on that today.

117
00:05:44,048 --> 00:05:47,531
However, I would like to point out one strength in that process.

118
00:05:48,352 --> 00:05:51,034
Every phase the material goes through is a collaborative effort.

119
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:55,197
From the start, our creative directors encourage input from the team

120
00:05:55,497 --> 00:05:59,140
and our actors, either before the shoot or during our full-day rehearsals,

121
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:01,682
especially with our actors.

122
00:06:02,643 --> 00:06:05,485
We even do a table read to break down the script before we rehearse.

123
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:08,507
If something doesn't feel right, the director and actors

124
00:06:08,547 --> 00:06:10,669
work out what sounds the most natural and try that.

125
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,172
Sometimes when we're shooting, we try a variation over takes

126
00:06:15,452 --> 00:06:17,353
and see what we like best in the edit bay later.

127
00:06:19,494 --> 00:06:21,755
When shooting a scene, we primarily capture it

128
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:24,437
in one continuous take, unless we need to break it

129
00:06:24,497 --> 00:06:26,918
up for additional set builds or to accommodate a stunt.

130
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,759
Lighting, camera angles, we don't worry about any

131
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:31,040
of this until post-production.

132
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,321
This lets us focus on getting that perfect master take

133
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:38,163
with the actors, encouraging the spontaneity improvisation

134
00:06:38,443 --> 00:06:40,745
that brings life and genuine emotion to the scenes.

135
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:45,885
During the shoots, the creative director acts as the director on set,

136
00:06:46,486 --> 00:06:49,709
partially because that's who's worked most closely with design

137
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:52,030
throughout the production process, and therefore,

138
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,172
who can give the most context to the actors.

139
00:06:55,313 --> 00:06:57,915
Meanwhile, the editor's job at the shoot is twofold.

140
00:06:58,496 --> 00:07:00,778
First, staying aware of the director's notes,

141
00:07:01,198 --> 00:07:04,100
since then they can later be more helpful at personally executing

142
00:07:04,441 --> 00:07:07,703
or communicating to others the director's intention behind each moment.

143
00:07:09,135 --> 00:07:11,916
And secondly, the editor ensures that we have the material

144
00:07:11,936 --> 00:07:14,136
we need to craft the dialogue performances later.

145
00:07:14,816 --> 00:07:17,197
This includes noting which takes were the best performances

146
00:07:17,257 --> 00:07:20,558
on a particular line, as well as asking for a wild take

147
00:07:20,578 --> 00:07:22,718
to get a clean read of a line when the performance

148
00:07:22,738 --> 00:07:25,339
is still fresh, rather than trying to recreate it

149
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:26,479
months later in ADR.

150
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:28,959
This is especially useful for efforts,

151
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:31,920
those grunts you hear when the players exert themselves,

152
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,341
which often get spoiled by set, prop, or suit noise

153
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:36,601
while the actors are moving around.

154
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:39,089
Drake exertion.

155
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,250
Very good.

156
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:40,450
Marker.

157
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,390
Marker.

158
00:07:41,971 --> 00:07:42,291
Great.

159
00:07:42,311 --> 00:07:44,692
Alright, just give me a hand with this.

160
00:07:44,712 --> 00:07:48,714
Come on, give me a hand with this.

161
00:08:05,381 --> 00:08:08,002
It's some of the most ridiculous things when we have them do well.

162
00:08:10,989 --> 00:08:14,531
Once the footage of our actors is in the can, the real work begins,

163
00:08:15,051 --> 00:08:18,313
breaking it into pieces for the design, animation, and audio teams.

164
00:08:19,073 --> 00:08:22,496
Back at the office, the editor, lead animator, and creative director

165
00:08:22,596 --> 00:08:24,117
start editing as soon as possible.

166
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,579
We found that cutting together reference videos

167
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:30,300
is the fastest and most efficient way to communicate

168
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,781
the eventual shape of a performance.

169
00:08:32,757 --> 00:08:35,638
After choosing which takes of mocap we want to use,

170
00:08:35,998 --> 00:08:38,238
we create four paneled videos called four ups

171
00:08:38,678 --> 00:08:40,379
that show the reference footage of the actors

172
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,539
alongside intended camera angles.

173
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,820
As we experiment with cameras and massaging the blocking

174
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,541
for the best composition, you end up having to watch them

175
00:08:49,581 --> 00:08:51,961
with a split focus, looking at the face here,

176
00:08:52,181 --> 00:08:53,281
the body and the camera there,

177
00:08:53,682 --> 00:08:55,062
sometimes even listening to audio

178
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:56,642
that doesn't match up with the actor's lips.

179
00:08:57,973 --> 00:09:00,093
This is because we can take advantage of the fact

180
00:09:00,113 --> 00:09:01,334
that this isn't live action.

181
00:09:01,854 --> 00:09:03,254
We can swap different audio takes

182
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:04,315
if we need to fix something,

183
00:09:04,615 --> 00:09:07,015
or use those wild takes to cover spoiled dialogue.

184
00:09:07,496 --> 00:09:09,816
The facial motion capture is even ordered separately

185
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,357
after the edit is locked and conformed to match.

186
00:09:12,877 --> 00:09:15,358
So we truly have the freedom to change anything.

187
00:09:16,798 --> 00:09:19,699
Like swapping only one actor's mocap for an alternate take

188
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:21,540
to get a cool gesture they did in there.

189
00:09:22,424 --> 00:09:24,224
or cutting between two different performances

190
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:25,485
right in the middle of a shot.

191
00:09:26,226 --> 00:09:28,187
Normally we hide these edits on camera cuts

192
00:09:28,307 --> 00:09:30,408
just like in live action, but if we can't,

193
00:09:30,928 --> 00:09:32,369
our animators then have to clean up

194
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:33,870
the resulting pop in the mocap.

195
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:38,852
Or at the most extreme, grabbing the face, audio, and body

196
00:09:39,153 --> 00:09:41,154
all from different sources to cobble together

197
00:09:41,174 --> 00:09:42,174
a moment we don't have.

198
00:09:42,895 --> 00:09:44,696
Usually that's because we discover something,

199
00:09:45,316 --> 00:09:47,017
a way something could play better in the edit,

200
00:09:47,477 --> 00:09:48,918
and since we didn't get it originally,

201
00:09:49,018 --> 00:09:49,858
we've got to fake it.

202
00:09:52,563 --> 00:09:55,807
But usually, the most we do is swap reads of some lines

203
00:09:55,847 --> 00:09:57,348
to increase clarity or subtlety.

204
00:09:57,949 --> 00:09:59,751
There's definitely magic in a performance

205
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:00,952
that can easily be shattered

206
00:10:01,032 --> 00:10:02,654
if you stray too far from the source.

207
00:10:04,856 --> 00:10:06,117
Once a scene's edit is approved,

208
00:10:06,678 --> 00:10:09,300
that 4UP reference video is funneled to every department

209
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,142
that will be involved in the further translation

210
00:10:11,162 --> 00:10:11,983
of these performances.

211
00:10:12,684 --> 00:10:15,186
This includes animation, props, environment,

212
00:10:15,286 --> 00:10:16,567
lighting, sound, and design.

213
00:10:17,539 --> 00:10:19,542
but they all know the scene isn't picture locked,

214
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:23,389
more like picture latched, because as I warned,

215
00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:25,453
these edits may very well have to change.

216
00:10:27,436 --> 00:10:28,999
Sometimes a change is required

217
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:30,081
because of a mistake in the edit.

218
00:10:31,095 --> 00:10:33,497
Nailing the timing of a moment can sometimes be difficult,

219
00:10:33,878 --> 00:10:36,179
since you're essentially looking at mannequins in one pane

220
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,221
and trying to sell an emotional transition

221
00:10:38,241 --> 00:10:39,963
that you can see on an actor in another.

222
00:10:40,743 --> 00:10:42,264
When the facial animation is applied

223
00:10:42,304 --> 00:10:43,706
and we look at the scene full frame,

224
00:10:44,146 --> 00:10:45,927
some things might move just a little too quickly.

225
00:10:46,388 --> 00:10:47,288
So we have to adjust,

226
00:10:47,849 --> 00:10:49,810
and then communicate these timing changes

227
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,071
to all the affected departments.

228
00:10:53,894 --> 00:10:56,716
Another change that comes up is that sets are often altered

229
00:10:56,736 --> 00:10:58,178
to accommodate gameplay revisions.

230
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:01,041
An entrance or an exit to a space had to move.

231
00:11:01,501 --> 00:11:02,943
There's a wall in front of that camera,

232
00:11:03,443 --> 00:11:05,145
or a cover object sitting right in the middle

233
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:05,726
of a character.

234
00:11:06,647 --> 00:11:08,909
Usually these require minor animation fixes

235
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:10,691
like moving characters or cameras,

236
00:11:11,252 --> 00:11:13,214
but at worst, the environment might need

237
00:11:13,234 --> 00:11:14,595
to be reverted by art and design.

238
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,487
The biggest changes that come in maintaining continuity

239
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:23,849
is in maintaining continuity with gameplay.

240
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,651
Since the transition of characters entering

241
00:11:26,691 --> 00:11:28,513
or leaving a scene needs to feel seamless,

242
00:11:28,853 --> 00:11:30,174
their animations have to match

243
00:11:30,214 --> 00:11:31,735
what's actually happening in gameplay.

244
00:11:32,516 --> 00:11:34,918
Design helps ensure this by creating pinch points

245
00:11:35,118 --> 00:11:37,180
that force a certain action from the player,

246
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,542
like opening a door or vaulting over something,

247
00:11:39,902 --> 00:11:41,463
that will blend into the start of a scene.

248
00:11:42,204 --> 00:11:44,746
And when it's over, we often blend characters' movements

249
00:11:44,846 --> 00:11:47,468
into regular gameplay animations to match on the way out.

250
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,642
But when gameplay changes, so do these entrances and exits.

251
00:11:55,403 --> 00:11:57,905
Often this means recapturing, or at least reanimating,

252
00:11:57,945 --> 00:11:59,046
that portion of the material.

253
00:12:00,247 --> 00:12:01,428
Like this scene in The Last of Us,

254
00:12:02,148 --> 00:12:04,150
which first had to have the camera corrected

255
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,311
to not be behind the player,

256
00:12:05,571 --> 00:12:07,172
because that would be too similar to gameplay.

257
00:12:08,033 --> 00:12:10,374
Then the level changed so that Joel would be in the lead

258
00:12:10,434 --> 00:12:12,456
rather than Ellie, so we needed a pickup

259
00:12:13,797 --> 00:12:15,598
to a new opening where Joel went in first.

260
00:12:20,685 --> 00:12:24,891
As these scenes change, we have to keep careful watch so nothing slips through the cracks.

261
00:12:25,552 --> 00:12:30,138
Sometimes, certain scenes linger in a partially done state for a long time,

262
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,104
waiting on a character model or a set that didn't exist when it was shot, for example.

263
00:12:36,136 --> 00:12:39,199
However, cutscenes are just the tip of the iceberg.

264
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,661
Since we like to keep the player in control

265
00:12:41,701 --> 00:12:44,163
as often as possible, we've increasingly relied

266
00:12:44,203 --> 00:12:45,744
upon methods other than cutscenes

267
00:12:46,005 --> 00:12:47,166
for implementing story beats.

268
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:50,769
One major way is through animations we call IGCs.

269
00:12:52,734 --> 00:12:54,995
IGC stands for in-game cinematic,

270
00:12:55,556 --> 00:12:56,837
because until Uncharted 4,

271
00:12:57,698 --> 00:12:59,499
all our cut scenes were pre-rendered movies,

272
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,802
so IGCs defined the distinction between animations

273
00:13:02,842 --> 00:13:04,143
that happened live in-game,

274
00:13:04,704 --> 00:13:07,146
versus more traditional non-interactive narrative moments

275
00:13:07,206 --> 00:13:07,826
like cut scenes.

276
00:13:09,508 --> 00:13:11,329
Now that everything plays back in real time,

277
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,671
the biggest distinction is that some aspect

278
00:13:13,691 --> 00:13:15,833
of the animation is usually interactive.

279
00:13:16,574 --> 00:13:18,796
In the very least, the player might have camera control,

280
00:13:19,156 --> 00:13:20,978
but that all depends on the particular IGC.

281
00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:25,008
Some are as insignificant as opening a door

282
00:13:25,248 --> 00:13:27,490
or walking into the frame at the start of a level.

283
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,251
Others are full-blown mini cinematics

284
00:13:31,451 --> 00:13:33,853
sandwiched between gameplay moments with no camera cuts,

285
00:13:34,193 --> 00:13:35,834
like during this puzzle in Uncharted 4.

286
00:13:38,015 --> 00:13:40,636
IGCs are also a clever method we use nowadays

287
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:42,857
to blend into and out of our cutscenes.

288
00:13:43,518 --> 00:13:45,439
The first or last shot of some cutscenes

289
00:13:45,499 --> 00:13:47,159
on Uncharted 4 were IGCs,

290
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,160
so the camera could blend smoothly,

291
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,701
transitioning on a camera cut

292
00:13:50,861 --> 00:13:52,622
to the rest of the non-interactive cutscene.

293
00:13:57,088 --> 00:13:59,969
There are hundreds of these littered all throughout the game

294
00:14:00,289 --> 00:14:02,850
and they will often change multiple times,

295
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,531
being shortened, lengthened, or recaptured

296
00:14:05,691 --> 00:14:07,331
until design thinks they feel right

297
00:14:07,411 --> 00:14:09,132
within the pace of the gameplay around them.

298
00:14:10,772 --> 00:14:12,533
Editorial, like with cut scenes,

299
00:14:12,813 --> 00:14:14,674
needs to keep up with any timing adjustments,

300
00:14:15,074 --> 00:14:16,494
moving parts of the audio around

301
00:14:16,574 --> 00:14:18,255
to match the animation as it changes.

302
00:14:19,355 --> 00:14:21,476
But even though the interactivity of an IGC

303
00:14:21,636 --> 00:14:23,316
offers great advantages for gameplay,

304
00:14:23,736 --> 00:14:24,797
the way their audio works

305
00:14:24,957 --> 00:14:26,717
sometimes offers additional challenges.

306
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,807
IGC dialogue is similar to a cut scene in that it plays

307
00:14:31,827 --> 00:14:34,072
from the first frame of the animation until the end,

308
00:14:34,794 --> 00:14:36,719
usually containing several lines of dialogue

309
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,864
and or efforts precisely timed to the animation.

310
00:14:40,218 --> 00:14:42,399
However, that is where the similarities end.

311
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,520
Unlike cut scenes, which play back like a movie,

312
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,881
where every volume level or perspective shift

313
00:14:47,941 --> 00:14:49,541
is crafted and controlled,

314
00:14:50,321 --> 00:14:51,822
IGCs often have to account

315
00:14:51,862 --> 00:14:53,462
for a real-time interactive camera.

316
00:14:54,183 --> 00:14:57,584
So IGC dialogue plays directly from the voice box

317
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:59,324
of each character in 3D space.

318
00:15:00,097 --> 00:15:06,902
This creates different mix issues, because our camera is the listener, i.e. microphone, by default.

319
00:15:07,643 --> 00:15:13,388
The benefit is that the position of the character's voice automatically matches what you're seeing on screen without any post-production work.

320
00:15:14,008 --> 00:15:14,889
Instant realism.

321
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:24,016
But, the downside is that if the camera is really far away, and you want to hear the speaker clearly, we have to cheat how that line plays.

322
00:15:24,977 --> 00:15:27,179
Or, if the camera cuts while someone is speaking...

323
00:15:27,612 --> 00:15:29,254
Suddenly, the person you hear in your left ear

324
00:15:29,434 --> 00:15:31,056
is now talking on your right mid-word,

325
00:15:31,236 --> 00:15:32,718
which can be extremely distracting.

326
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:35,060
Like in this moment from Uncharted 2,

327
00:15:35,381 --> 00:15:36,522
we dealt with both problems.

328
00:15:37,063 --> 00:15:39,345
It took a lot of trickery to make Nate's voice audible

329
00:15:39,385 --> 00:15:40,486
from across the ice cave.

330
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:42,789
But when that camera cuts across the space,

331
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:45,111
you'll notice we quite couldn't fix the pop

332
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:46,853
in Nate's voice as the camera cuts.

333
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,180
Switch on your side!

334
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,841
Yeah, yeah.

335
00:16:08,445 --> 00:16:09,886
But wait, there's more.

336
00:16:11,146 --> 00:16:13,448
Cutscenes and IGCs are only half the battle.

337
00:16:14,409 --> 00:16:16,170
Our performances would not feel seamless

338
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,511
without a lot of other systems that play in between them.

339
00:16:19,432 --> 00:16:21,213
But before I break those down further,

340
00:16:21,633 --> 00:16:23,194
I would like to look at an example clip

341
00:16:23,294 --> 00:16:25,416
of what it all looks like when everything comes together.

342
00:16:27,337 --> 00:16:31,421
During this beat of Uncharted 4, Nate and Sam are just starting the next leg of their

343
00:16:31,461 --> 00:16:36,165
journey, exploring the ruins of a Scottish monastery that their rival, Rafe, and the

344
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:39,388
team of mercenaries he's employed are trying to excavate with dynamite.

345
00:16:40,328 --> 00:16:44,352
The Drake brothers meet the shoreline mercs for the first time, learn the new dynamite

346
00:16:44,372 --> 00:16:49,136
gameplay mechanic, and solve the first puzzle of the level, finding a crate to climb past

347
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:49,957
a section of ruins.

348
00:16:50,637 --> 00:16:53,220
That is, until another team of mercenaries arrives.

349
00:16:59,933 --> 00:17:00,894
That's a long drop.

350
00:17:02,275 --> 00:17:04,716
Yeah. We need to find another way down.

351
00:17:04,736 --> 00:17:12,160
Hey, this should hold.

352
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,560
Good call.

353
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:27,768
What the hell is all this?

354
00:17:29,821 --> 00:17:30,762
Excavation equipment.

355
00:17:34,865 --> 00:17:35,426
Shoreline?

356
00:17:36,387 --> 00:17:36,547
What?

357
00:17:37,067 --> 00:17:37,307
Look.

358
00:17:38,749 --> 00:17:40,050
I thought they were just by the cathedral.

359
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:02,090
We're good.

360
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,552
Yeah.

361
00:18:04,413 --> 00:18:05,855
Nice to meet you too, Shoreline.

362
00:18:06,576 --> 00:18:07,877
Seems like they were expecting us.

363
00:18:08,638 --> 00:18:10,701
And like they're searching away from the cathedral.

364
00:18:11,421 --> 00:18:13,584
Which means we should get to that graveyard pronto.

365
00:18:14,005 --> 00:18:14,385
Exactly.

366
00:18:37,893 --> 00:18:38,593
What is this place?

367
00:18:39,033 --> 00:18:40,653
The monks had several living quarters.

368
00:18:40,673 --> 00:18:43,454
The main one being by the graveyard, of course.

369
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,314
Location, location, location.

370
00:18:47,635 --> 00:18:48,695
More shoreline equipment.

371
00:18:49,515 --> 00:18:51,035
At least no shoreline-ers.

372
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,616
Now, what do you bet?

373
00:18:59,877 --> 00:19:00,077
Yep.

374
00:19:01,277 --> 00:19:01,817
Dynamite.

375
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:04,578
Be careful with that stuff, huh?

376
00:19:13,993 --> 00:19:18,076
I was very loud. Hopefully they didn't hear us.

377
00:19:18,796 --> 00:19:21,018
Hopefully we just blend in with the other explosions.

378
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,621
Look, there's a way up through the roof.

379
00:19:27,582 --> 00:19:30,524
That's too high for a boost though.

380
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:31,805
Well, let's find something to climb on.

381
00:19:32,745 --> 00:19:32,905
Yeah.

382
00:19:52,935 --> 00:19:55,358
Hey, we can use this to climb out of that building.

383
00:19:55,378 --> 00:20:04,931
There you go. Take that, door.

384
00:20:04,951 --> 00:20:06,894
You're pretty good with that stuff.

385
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,317
Well, I've blown a lot of shit up over the years.

386
00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:38,420
I think we got away.

387
00:20:43,063 --> 00:20:44,944
It's a mellow sequence,

388
00:20:45,524 --> 00:20:47,426
but there's actually a lot going on here.

389
00:20:48,126 --> 00:20:49,767
And every single element that's happening

390
00:20:50,108 --> 00:20:51,549
is helping convey our story beats.

391
00:20:52,689 --> 00:20:54,711
At a glance, these elements include

392
00:20:56,292 --> 00:20:58,474
IGCs when Nate uses his rope

393
00:20:58,774 --> 00:21:00,155
and later when he picks up the dynamite.

394
00:21:01,876 --> 00:21:03,957
Animated gesture layers on Nate and Sam

395
00:21:04,037 --> 00:21:05,258
as they explore and converse.

396
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,687
Oh, and nice.

397
00:21:11,668 --> 00:21:12,129
Still going?

398
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,410
Yes. Animated gesture layers.

399
00:21:16,691 --> 00:21:16,972
Come on.

400
00:21:20,594 --> 00:21:23,956
A, yes. A brief cut scene of Nate

401
00:21:23,976 --> 00:21:26,938
and Sam finding the Shoreline equipment before they're ambushed.

402
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:31,500
Systemic enemy dialogue from our Shoreline mercenaries

403
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,521
as they attack the player.

404
00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:36,201
Systemic buddy dialogue from Sam

405
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:38,403
when the player successfully stays in cover.

406
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:41,907
Efforts as Nate knocks out the last Merc

407
00:21:42,227 --> 00:21:44,310
and then lands from a long drop near those ruins.

408
00:21:45,531 --> 00:21:48,134
And of course, before and after all of this,

409
00:21:48,194 --> 00:21:50,597
there is also crap tons of story dialogue playing.

410
00:21:52,339 --> 00:21:54,201
So, about that story dialogue.

411
00:21:55,478 --> 00:21:57,259
Most of the dialogue you hear in our games

412
00:21:57,539 --> 00:22:01,002
are individual lines scripted by hand with specific timing.

413
00:22:01,782 --> 00:22:04,844
We even have a designer and a scripter 100% dedicated

414
00:22:04,884 --> 00:22:06,445
to creating systems for hooking it up.

415
00:22:07,446 --> 00:22:09,787
They can't complete an entire game on their own

416
00:22:09,908 --> 00:22:11,389
since by the time the game is finished,

417
00:22:11,769 --> 00:22:13,770
there's too much material for them to cover alone,

418
00:22:14,451 --> 00:22:16,512
but they are usually the ones triggering lines

419
00:22:17,092 --> 00:22:19,014
that play based on numerous conditions.

420
00:22:19,594 --> 00:22:21,135
Some as simple as when a player walks

421
00:22:21,155 --> 00:22:23,957
through a defined region, others much more complex.

422
00:22:25,175 --> 00:22:28,917
Rather than play with rigid timing, like cut scenes in IGCs,

423
00:22:29,518 --> 00:22:32,159
we cut our dialogue into pieces that can flexibly respond

424
00:22:32,199 --> 00:22:33,080
to the player's actions.

425
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,662
This also means we can adjust the execution more easily

426
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,363
as things change during development.

427
00:22:40,264 --> 00:22:42,446
These in-game dialogue moments actually make up

428
00:22:42,526 --> 00:22:45,248
a larger percentage of narrative beats than our cut scenes.

429
00:22:46,028 --> 00:22:47,929
We feel this type of material is crucial

430
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:50,551
because it carries the story forward

431
00:22:50,851 --> 00:22:53,133
by keeping the characters alive between those cut scenes.

432
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:57,052
It can justify practical and gameplay-driven goals

433
00:22:57,112 --> 00:22:58,453
within the context of the narrative.

434
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:02,836
Likewise, it informs the player of any changes in tension,

435
00:23:03,036 --> 00:23:04,977
like exploration or combat states.

436
00:23:06,378 --> 00:23:08,179
And it's also a vital tool for selling

437
00:23:08,219 --> 00:23:10,620
the realism of the environment in the player's mind

438
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,842
when the characters respond contextually to it.

439
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:17,123
Unlike the cut scenes in many of the IGCs,

440
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:20,125
most of this dialogue does not come from the mocap stage.

441
00:23:20,686 --> 00:23:23,228
That's because it primarily requires the character speaking

442
00:23:23,448 --> 00:23:25,130
while the player is in full control.

443
00:23:26,731 --> 00:23:29,213
So, we record the lion's share of this content

444
00:23:29,453 --> 00:23:30,434
at an ADR studio.

445
00:23:31,215 --> 00:23:32,556
The actors are usually paired up

446
00:23:32,616 --> 00:23:35,038
so we profit from their chemistry, just like at mocap.

447
00:23:35,758 --> 00:23:37,980
Also, they wear the same type of microphones

448
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:41,003
so that the audio quality matches that of the stage.

449
00:23:43,103 --> 00:23:45,805
The scripts for ADR sessions come online rather late,

450
00:23:46,465 --> 00:23:48,026
as the levels they often reflect

451
00:23:48,066 --> 00:23:49,607
are still being locked down by design.

452
00:23:50,768 --> 00:23:52,069
This means that most of the time,

453
00:23:52,129 --> 00:23:53,389
the actors are reading their lines

454
00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:54,710
without any time to prepare.

455
00:23:55,491 --> 00:23:57,352
So we bring a video capture of the level

456
00:23:57,572 --> 00:23:58,672
in its most current state

457
00:23:59,033 --> 00:24:00,894
to give them as much context as possible.

458
00:24:02,454 --> 00:24:03,855
And any time there is a cut scene

459
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,476
that we've already shot and implemented,

460
00:24:05,876 --> 00:24:07,537
we watch those down with the actors too,

461
00:24:08,038 --> 00:24:10,059
to remind them of the character's emotional state

462
00:24:10,099 --> 00:24:10,899
that they need to match

463
00:24:11,219 --> 00:24:12,640
in order to keep the tone consistent.

464
00:24:14,724 --> 00:24:16,304
Because the game is still in flux,

465
00:24:16,645 --> 00:24:19,025
we record a variety of material in anticipation

466
00:24:19,105 --> 00:24:20,586
of ways in which the game might change.

467
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:24,106
Gameplay conversations make up the bulk of our recording.

468
00:24:24,727 --> 00:24:26,187
But these aren't always straightforward

469
00:24:26,387 --> 00:24:28,307
because sometimes parts of them are optional.

470
00:24:28,948 --> 00:24:31,068
The actors will perform one version of the conversation

471
00:24:31,088 --> 00:24:33,369
all the way through and then pick up the other versions

472
00:24:33,449 --> 00:24:35,149
right away to keep the energy consistent.

473
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,250
Such as in that Scotland clip,

474
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,470
different lines would play out depending on

475
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,471
when the player interacted with that yellow crate.

476
00:24:46,534 --> 00:24:47,395
How do we open this door?

477
00:24:49,379 --> 00:24:51,362
Look, there's a way up through the roof.

478
00:24:52,484 --> 00:24:53,847
It's too high for a boost, though.

479
00:24:55,189 --> 00:24:56,452
Hey, we can use that yellow crate!

480
00:25:00,606 --> 00:25:03,409
Sometimes we also pick up alternate versions of lines,

481
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,473
alts for short, especially when the level

482
00:25:06,553 --> 00:25:08,996
is in a rougher state and we need to have multiple options

483
00:25:09,116 --> 00:25:10,617
as design locks things down later.

484
00:25:11,558 --> 00:25:13,881
This frequently happens in puzzle spaces among others,

485
00:25:14,502 --> 00:25:17,405
since they require tons of specific VO and animations

486
00:25:17,465 --> 00:25:19,608
to cover what the player does and in what order.

487
00:25:20,934 --> 00:25:24,139
On Uncharted 4, we even kept a wish list of alt lines

488
00:25:24,199 --> 00:25:25,581
that design thought they might need

489
00:25:26,122 --> 00:25:27,624
and tried to cover them all as pickups

490
00:25:27,664 --> 00:25:28,525
near the end of recording.

491
00:25:29,226 --> 00:25:31,710
This resulted in much better coverage for the final game

492
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:32,951
than we've ever had before.

493
00:25:35,623 --> 00:25:39,106
We also have a whole category we call CYA lines,

494
00:25:39,566 --> 00:25:42,609
as in cover your ass, which are generic phrases like,

495
00:25:42,769 --> 00:25:45,692
hey, look at this, and come on, this way,

496
00:25:46,152 --> 00:25:49,355
which we record in multiple emotional states and contexts

497
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:51,757
just in case we need them at a later date,

498
00:25:52,277 --> 00:25:53,698
either to help with gameplay changes

499
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:55,520
or maybe to sell a character beat.

500
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,643
We record these with our heroes and all their buddy allies.

501
00:26:00,753 --> 00:26:04,694
Just like in MoCap, our actors are also encouraged to improvise during ADR.

502
00:26:05,474 --> 00:26:10,216
Sometimes this will inspire us to rewrite and re-record a new version of a conversation

503
00:26:10,336 --> 00:26:10,816
on the spot.

504
00:26:11,976 --> 00:26:16,617
And at the end of most sessions, we also record wild passes of our levels, where the actors

505
00:26:16,677 --> 00:26:19,998
watch the playthrough video again and are encouraged to riff on top of it.

506
00:26:21,017 --> 00:26:23,217
Though our writers try to cover everything we need

507
00:26:23,277 --> 00:26:24,518
in a given section of the game,

508
00:26:24,978 --> 00:26:27,038
this often provides alternate versions of lines

509
00:26:27,338 --> 00:26:29,139
or even completely new conversations

510
00:26:29,459 --> 00:26:31,499
that add enormous amounts of spark and character.

511
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,560
We extract these gems and use them whenever possible.

512
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,401
For instance, Sam's location, location, location line

513
00:26:38,461 --> 00:26:41,362
in the Scotland clip was an improv that Troy Baker threw in,

514
00:26:41,682 --> 00:26:42,162
and we kept it.

515
00:26:44,651 --> 00:26:48,935
All recorded dialogue is then brought back to the office and stacked in time to the video.

516
00:26:49,576 --> 00:26:55,321
This means we each take of line, this means each take of a line is edited in a Pro Tools

517
00:26:55,361 --> 00:26:59,365
playlist and arranged in columns so we can quickly listen down to all the takes of a

518
00:26:59,405 --> 00:27:00,826
line when making our selects.

519
00:27:10,227 --> 00:27:13,169
These picked lines are then edited into individual files

520
00:27:13,209 --> 00:27:16,731
with unique names and uploaded into our dialogue database tool.

521
00:27:17,652 --> 00:27:20,854
Editors also distribute scripts from the database to our designers

522
00:27:21,214 --> 00:27:23,476
so they have a list of what content they need to implement.

523
00:27:25,197 --> 00:27:28,699
Along with the scripts, we also supply another form of reference movie.

524
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:32,562
Unlike our cut scene 4-ups, which are tied to motion capture data,

525
00:27:33,082 --> 00:27:36,224
these are instead exports of the very movies the actors ADR'd to,

526
00:27:36,604 --> 00:27:39,946
with dialogue placed to match the timing of the actor's original deliveries.

527
00:27:42,807 --> 00:27:43,507
Hang in there, Joel.

528
00:27:43,527 --> 00:27:54,675
Oh, shit.

529
00:27:56,237 --> 00:27:56,457
Okay.

530
00:27:57,477 --> 00:27:58,438
There's got to be another way.

531
00:28:01,801 --> 00:28:06,444
These ref vids help show where and when the individual lines of dialogue should be scripted

532
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:10,907
to play, so that it feels and sounds like a realistic performance.

533
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:17,988
Designers use it as a guideline as they translate all this cinematic pacing and subtlety into pretty much scripted math

534
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:24,614
The goal is to include proper beats for a breath or a natural pause between lines

535
00:28:25,294 --> 00:28:30,158
Either for the speaker to have a new thought or for the companion character to actually listen before responding

536
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:34,962
When we don't hit this the moment can feel rushed disjointed or flat-out confusing

537
00:28:36,492 --> 00:28:37,953
It sometimes takes several passes

538
00:28:37,993 --> 00:28:39,993
to get the timing right in game.

539
00:28:40,794 --> 00:28:43,074
Designers can only use these movies as a guideline

540
00:28:43,474 --> 00:28:46,355
because often the video's timing was too fast or too slow

541
00:28:46,675 --> 00:28:48,516
and is not completely representative

542
00:28:48,616 --> 00:28:50,437
about how everyone might play the game.

543
00:28:51,417 --> 00:28:53,037
They use their best judgment trying

544
00:28:53,077 --> 00:28:55,358
to keep three different potential play styles in mind.

545
00:28:56,979 --> 00:28:59,840
Some players like to explore, taking their time,

546
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,720
stopping to hear every lovingly crafted line

547
00:29:02,761 --> 00:29:03,721
so they don't miss a thing.

548
00:29:04,657 --> 00:29:07,358
But if we were to time out everything to that play style,

549
00:29:07,678 --> 00:29:09,719
it would ruin the experience of more average players

550
00:29:09,979 --> 00:29:12,260
who like to enjoy the story but keep things moving.

551
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,521
Where we can, the simplest solution

552
00:29:15,801 --> 00:29:17,402
is just to have certain lines not play

553
00:29:17,442 --> 00:29:18,722
if the player is going too fast.

554
00:29:19,202 --> 00:29:20,463
Like in these Scotland ruins,

555
00:29:20,863 --> 00:29:22,104
the line specifically pointing out

556
00:29:22,124 --> 00:29:23,864
that a ledge is too high for a boost

557
00:29:24,184 --> 00:29:26,585
doesn't play if the player rushes out of there

558
00:29:26,645 --> 00:29:28,586
before the previous conversation is finished.

559
00:29:29,647 --> 00:29:30,487
Hey, got the door open.

560
00:29:31,027 --> 00:29:33,468
That was very loud.

561
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,212
Hopefully they didn't hear us.

562
00:29:35,893 --> 00:29:38,113
Hopefully we just blend in with the other explosions.

563
00:29:38,513 --> 00:29:40,493
Look, there's a way up through the roof.

564
00:29:42,534 --> 00:29:43,894
Oh, let's find something to climb on.

565
00:29:44,794 --> 00:29:45,014
Yeah.

566
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:48,395
And then there's the speedy players

567
00:29:48,695 --> 00:29:49,775
who dash through the puzzles

568
00:29:49,815 --> 00:29:51,176
to get to the next combat setup.

569
00:29:52,136 --> 00:29:54,656
We do our best to get our conversations playing naturally,

570
00:29:54,776 --> 00:29:56,557
but quickly, so they don't get lost,

571
00:29:56,897 --> 00:29:58,297
but sometimes it can't be helped.

572
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,794
Once in a while, we have an area too small

573
00:30:03,834 --> 00:30:05,415
for the amount of VO that has to play

574
00:30:05,815 --> 00:30:07,756
and end up shipping with moments that can feel

575
00:30:07,817 --> 00:30:09,477
like a string of lines back to back,

576
00:30:09,778 --> 00:30:11,619
depending on how quickly the player is going.

577
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:13,980
Like this moment in Uncharted 3

578
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,981
that just ended up a little too tight

579
00:30:16,201 --> 00:30:18,243
compared to the pacing of the cut scene that preceded it.

580
00:30:21,725 --> 00:30:25,747
Well, who are we to argue with Sir Francis?

581
00:30:27,848 --> 00:30:30,030
When you say we head down there and end this thing.

582
00:30:32,143 --> 00:30:32,903
Once and for all.

583
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:40,765
Look at this place.

584
00:30:40,785 --> 00:30:42,545
The whole city's resting on this cavern.

585
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:44,065
Doesn't look very safe, does it?

586
00:30:44,645 --> 00:30:45,626
That's an understatement.

587
00:30:46,186 --> 00:30:47,226
We've got to find a way down there.

588
00:30:52,587 --> 00:30:53,707
If we get the timing right,

589
00:30:54,407 --> 00:30:59,708
it can convey subtlety without needing a specific body gesture or facial performance to sell a moment.

590
00:31:00,574 --> 00:31:01,974
Like in this bit from The Last of Us,

591
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:05,575
the pause before Ellie's oh line conveys a turn,

592
00:31:06,075 --> 00:31:08,116
her realization about Joel's darker past.

593
00:31:09,136 --> 00:31:10,736
Her follow-up question then gives Joel

594
00:31:10,776 --> 00:31:11,977
an awkward pause of his own.

595
00:31:12,897 --> 00:31:14,537
All of this emotional content managed

596
00:31:14,557 --> 00:31:16,157
to fit in one small stairwell,

597
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:17,738
even if the player never stops.

598
00:31:19,478 --> 00:31:20,458
Come on, let's get out of here.

599
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:28,300
How did you know?

600
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,560
Know what?

601
00:31:30,153 --> 00:31:30,913
What about the ambush?

602
00:31:32,113 --> 00:31:33,153
I've been on both sides.

603
00:31:34,974 --> 00:31:35,114
Oh.

604
00:31:38,894 --> 00:31:39,635
So, uh,

605
00:31:40,215 --> 00:31:41,355
you kill a lot of innocent people?

606
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:45,496
Yeah.

607
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:46,456
We'll take that as a yes.

608
00:31:47,316 --> 00:31:48,316
Take it however you want.

609
00:31:52,537 --> 00:31:55,117
That moment worked on dialogue timing alone.

610
00:31:55,918 --> 00:31:56,818
But when we need more...

611
00:31:57,333 --> 00:32:01,280
we now can dynamically add extra body motions to our story dialogue

612
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,604
to increase physical and emotional realism.

613
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:07,129
In that Scotland clip, when you saw Nate waving his arm

614
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:09,113
and actually looking at Sam while talking to him,

615
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,577
that was an example of our gesture system.

616
00:32:13,268 --> 00:32:16,371
In previous games, we've had all sorts of contextual move sets

617
00:32:16,511 --> 00:32:19,293
and animation that helped sell the reality of the hero's

618
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:21,955
world by having him or her react to their environment,

619
00:32:22,695 --> 00:32:24,256
whether it be recoiling from fire,

620
00:32:24,697 --> 00:32:26,798
stumbling while exhausted, bracing themselves

621
00:32:26,838 --> 00:32:28,199
against walls, et cetera.

622
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,501
Our designers are also able to play

623
00:32:31,562 --> 00:32:34,584
additional unique animations on our AI characters

624
00:32:34,624 --> 00:32:36,405
to help bring them to life contextually.

625
00:32:36,825 --> 00:32:39,547
That's what allows Sam to look around and dynamically check

626
00:32:39,587 --> 00:32:40,388
out the world around him.

627
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:46,080
But now we employ an additional level of detail, gestures.

628
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,981
These are partial animations that play on top

629
00:32:49,021 --> 00:32:51,381
of normal gameplay animations, like a head shake,

630
00:32:51,441 --> 00:32:53,282
an arm pointing, a shrug, et cetera.

631
00:32:53,902 --> 00:32:55,942
The player can be running, climbing, or crouching,

632
00:32:56,002 --> 00:32:57,683
and these layers will usually still play.

633
00:32:58,803 --> 00:33:00,443
In case you're wondering why sometimes an arm

634
00:33:00,503 --> 00:33:01,503
isn't moving in that clip,

635
00:33:01,903 --> 00:33:03,964
that's because it's not part of the animation's layer,

636
00:33:04,544 --> 00:33:06,964
meaning the player can be carrying a gun or another object

637
00:33:06,984 --> 00:33:08,885
while the rest of the body does the gesture.

638
00:33:11,693 --> 00:33:17,058
One of the ways we sell these moments is by hooking up a specific gesture to a line of dialogue in script.

639
00:33:17,999 --> 00:33:22,143
So when each line plays, the gestures play on top of whatever the character is doing.

640
00:33:22,984 --> 00:33:28,469
Programming and scripting magic also helps the speaking characters actually look at each other dynamically when appropriate.

641
00:33:30,512 --> 00:33:33,012
Since we don't record specific gestures for every line,

642
00:33:33,372 --> 00:33:36,273
the final performance isn't as rich as a cut scene might be,

643
00:33:36,813 --> 00:33:38,954
but the result is still an added level of life

644
00:33:39,034 --> 00:33:40,695
that doesn't restrict the player's movement

645
00:33:40,995 --> 00:33:42,235
as they roam around the game world.

646
00:33:43,975 --> 00:33:47,116
Though we can also hook up custom facial animation gestures

647
00:33:47,236 --> 00:33:48,417
to lines in the same way,

648
00:33:48,797 --> 00:33:50,357
we usually don't go to the extra work,

649
00:33:50,857 --> 00:33:51,998
since the camera is normally

650
00:33:52,038 --> 00:33:53,398
behind the player character's head

651
00:33:53,718 --> 00:33:55,999
and far enough away from all other speaking characters.

652
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:59,751
By default, we employ a neat procedural system,

653
00:34:00,031 --> 00:34:02,212
which generates lip sync and facial animations

654
00:34:02,532 --> 00:34:05,093
using the audio file's amplitude and subtitle text.

655
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:08,914
This place, monks had several living quarters.

656
00:34:09,695 --> 00:34:11,696
Main one being by the graveyard, of course.

657
00:34:13,096 --> 00:34:14,517
Location, location, location.

658
00:34:18,418 --> 00:34:19,839
Besides the story dialogue,

659
00:34:20,279 --> 00:34:22,880
we have another category of lines called systemic VO.

660
00:34:23,746 --> 00:34:26,047
These groups of lines, or these are groups of lines

661
00:34:26,247 --> 00:34:28,248
with similar context that can play

662
00:34:28,288 --> 00:34:30,069
when triggered by AI-driven events.

663
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:32,471
This material helps to add life,

664
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:34,452
reinforce character relationships,

665
00:34:34,792 --> 00:34:36,713
and provide feedback in various situations

666
00:34:36,753 --> 00:34:37,473
throughout the game,

667
00:34:38,054 --> 00:34:39,995
mostly during types of gameplay scenarios

668
00:34:40,055 --> 00:34:42,176
that use repeated systems like combat.

669
00:34:44,297 --> 00:34:46,018
When an enemy spots the player, for instance,

670
00:34:46,278 --> 00:34:48,460
they have specific lines that they use to call that out.

671
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,501
There he is, I see him.

672
00:34:51,101 --> 00:34:52,683
These buckets, as we call them,

673
00:34:53,023 --> 00:34:55,024
offer multiple varieties that can play

674
00:34:55,084 --> 00:34:56,405
based on the same situation,

675
00:34:56,725 --> 00:34:57,906
so the player doesn't just hear,

676
00:34:58,106 --> 00:35:00,388
I see them, over and over and over.

677
00:35:01,429 --> 00:35:02,670
At the end of our Scotland demo,

678
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,891
Sam called out one of his systemic lines

679
00:35:05,111 --> 00:35:07,393
to indicate the player is still hidden from the enemy.

680
00:35:07,853 --> 00:35:09,895
The entire bucket consists of these lines.

681
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:12,557
I think we got away.

682
00:35:13,831 --> 00:35:15,092
Hurry, Nathan, we lost them.

683
00:35:17,113 --> 00:35:17,653
We lost them.

684
00:35:18,253 --> 00:35:19,334
I think we lost them.

685
00:35:20,795 --> 00:35:22,095
I think they lost track of us.

686
00:35:23,156 --> 00:35:24,617
Looks like we gave them the slip.

687
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,341
This sort of dialogue serves a practical function in terms

688
00:35:32,401 --> 00:35:35,343
of player feedback, but it also keeps the characters alive

689
00:35:35,403 --> 00:35:38,444
and reacting to what's going on in the same way the storylines do,

690
00:35:39,525 --> 00:35:42,306
which is why we don't only use systemic dialogue for our enemies.

691
00:35:43,402 --> 00:35:46,105
Any dialogue triggered by AI, rather than just script,

692
00:35:46,265 --> 00:35:47,386
falls into this category,

693
00:35:47,806 --> 00:35:49,588
including buckets for any major characters,

694
00:35:49,868 --> 00:35:52,150
the hero, their AI-controlled buddies,

695
00:35:53,171 --> 00:35:55,192
and, of course, all our multiplayer characters,

696
00:35:55,333 --> 00:35:57,795
since that mode is pretty much all combat mechanics.

697
00:35:59,997 --> 00:36:02,479
The system is controlled by the global tension state,

698
00:36:02,819 --> 00:36:04,521
which we break down into four stages,

699
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:08,424
unaware, investigate, search, and combat.

700
00:36:10,571 --> 00:36:13,592
In Unaware, any threats nearby have no knowledge

701
00:36:13,612 --> 00:36:15,173
of the player or their companions.

702
00:36:15,853 --> 00:36:18,454
Enemies can converse with custom story-based dialogue,

703
00:36:18,554 --> 00:36:20,535
like they did at the very end of that Scotland clip.

704
00:36:21,356 --> 00:36:22,756
The player and his buddies, meanwhile,

705
00:36:23,036 --> 00:36:24,917
will likely be in standard explore mode.

706
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,298
This is the natural state of the game.

707
00:36:28,078 --> 00:36:29,819
If they get close to enemies in this state,

708
00:36:30,259 --> 00:36:32,100
buddies and the hero will use whispered versions

709
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,161
of their various buckets, so the characters sound

710
00:36:34,181 --> 00:36:35,262
like they're trying to stay hidden.

711
00:36:37,146 --> 00:36:39,448
In Investigate, tension rises a bit.

712
00:36:39,968 --> 00:36:41,650
The enemies heard or saw some evidence

713
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:42,631
of player interference.

714
00:36:43,591 --> 00:36:45,973
Then they try to uncover the source of the distraction,

715
00:36:46,294 --> 00:36:47,835
now playing their systemic buckets

716
00:36:48,035 --> 00:36:48,976
regarding what they saw,

717
00:36:49,236 --> 00:36:51,738
checking in if anyone saw anything, et cetera.

718
00:36:52,459 --> 00:36:53,840
This is the first level of tension

719
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,261
where the player would feel threatened

720
00:36:55,662 --> 00:36:56,642
and that they should either fight

721
00:36:56,903 --> 00:36:57,803
or get the hell out of there.

722
00:36:59,809 --> 00:37:02,131
In Search, tension is near its breaking point

723
00:37:02,371 --> 00:37:04,793
because enemies saw the player, then lost track of them.

724
00:37:05,393 --> 00:37:07,555
They speak buckets of lines so the player can audibly

725
00:37:07,615 --> 00:37:10,357
locate the enemies attempting to converge on their position.

726
00:37:11,157 --> 00:37:12,899
Feedback from the heroes remains whispered,

727
00:37:13,179 --> 00:37:15,400
including buddies pointing out where the nearest enemy is.

728
00:37:16,081 --> 00:37:17,482
On your left, behind you.

729
00:37:18,162 --> 00:37:19,684
Or warning them if someone approaching

730
00:37:19,784 --> 00:37:20,944
is carrying a powerful weapon.

731
00:37:21,545 --> 00:37:22,666
Look out, shotgun.

732
00:37:23,226 --> 00:37:23,767
That sort of thing.

733
00:37:25,678 --> 00:37:27,820
Combat is when all hell breaks loose,

734
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,302
and in our games uses almost exclusively systemic dialogue.

735
00:37:32,322 --> 00:37:34,543
But since we want it to feel as nuanced

736
00:37:34,623 --> 00:37:36,224
as any of the quieter story moments,

737
00:37:36,544 --> 00:37:38,445
we employ a lot of buckets to cover

738
00:37:38,485 --> 00:37:40,126
a variety of potential situations.

739
00:37:42,067 --> 00:37:43,348
Enemies are aware of the player

740
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:45,909
and actively trying to attack him or her

741
00:37:45,929 --> 00:37:48,211
with guns, fists, or whatever other means they have.

742
00:37:48,882 --> 00:37:50,663
They have lines announcing when they are flanking,

743
00:37:50,924 --> 00:37:52,705
pointing out the player's exact location,

744
00:37:53,326 --> 00:37:55,288
or warning each other the player has a power weapon

745
00:37:55,308 --> 00:37:57,029
like an RPG or a Molotov cocktail.

746
00:37:58,571 --> 00:38:00,353
Buddies continue to warn the player

747
00:38:00,393 --> 00:38:01,554
the same as they do in stealth,

748
00:38:01,934 --> 00:38:03,015
but instead of whispering,

749
00:38:03,315 --> 00:38:05,277
their lines are now shouted over gunfire.

750
00:38:06,192 --> 00:38:08,175
We also have dialogue that helps emphasize

751
00:38:08,215 --> 00:38:09,617
their relationship to the hero,

752
00:38:10,057 --> 00:38:11,199
i.e. that they care about them.

753
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,443
Buddies ask if the hero is okay after they've been shot

754
00:38:14,503 --> 00:38:15,745
or stumbled by an explosion.

755
00:38:16,245 --> 00:38:18,048
They shout out that they're coming to rescue the player

756
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:19,169
if they're grabbed by an enemy,

757
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,972
and say thank you to the player

758
00:38:21,112 --> 00:38:22,233
if they are rescued in return.

759
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:26,591
The hero also has dialogue to connect the player

760
00:38:26,631 --> 00:38:27,692
to their emotional state,

761
00:38:27,992 --> 00:38:30,034
like the stress of diving out of the way of a grenade

762
00:38:30,054 --> 00:38:31,234
would be, oh God,

763
00:38:31,775 --> 00:38:34,297
or stealing themselves up while reloading in cover.

764
00:38:34,837 --> 00:38:37,619
Drake's is usually like, okay, here we go.

765
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,281
There's usually something that plays

766
00:38:40,321 --> 00:38:42,022
after taking down an enemy as well.

767
00:38:42,462 --> 00:38:44,163
In Uncharted, it's usually a funny quip

768
00:38:44,203 --> 00:38:46,105
that suits the tone like, lights out,

769
00:38:46,645 --> 00:38:48,026
whereas in The Last of Us,

770
00:38:48,106 --> 00:38:51,628
it matched the world's grittier tone, just, okay.

771
00:38:54,383 --> 00:38:56,764
Since systemic lines have a more functional purpose,

772
00:38:57,065 --> 00:38:59,466
they sometimes lack the subtlety or subtext

773
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:01,047
that our longer conversations do.

774
00:39:01,868 --> 00:39:03,929
But they always maintain the same personality

775
00:39:04,029 --> 00:39:05,170
as the character delivering them,

776
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,151
so that the player doesn't become weary

777
00:39:07,191 --> 00:39:08,492
of hearing the exact same thing

778
00:39:08,572 --> 00:39:10,313
from multiple characters over and over.

779
00:39:11,597 --> 00:39:14,219
For example, Sam calls our main character Nathan,

780
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:16,381
or little brother in a lot of his systemic warnings,

781
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:18,403
and is more ball-busting in his tone,

782
00:39:18,983 --> 00:39:20,104
while Sully calls him kid

783
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:21,526
and maintains a more paternal tone.

784
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:25,510
Elena calls him Nate and has her own brand

785
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,651
of loving exasperation with our hero

786
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:28,933
in her pattern of speech.

787
00:39:31,249 --> 00:39:32,810
Even with personality thrown in though,

788
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:35,332
these lines could still sound somewhat repetitive.

789
00:39:36,012 --> 00:39:37,394
So we have a shuffle system,

790
00:39:37,654 --> 00:39:40,816
which keeps track of every line said by every AI group,

791
00:39:41,217 --> 00:39:43,739
advancing the cue for any one bucket across the board

792
00:39:43,779 --> 00:39:46,441
when they speak, ensuring the same exact line

793
00:39:46,481 --> 00:39:47,582
will not be heard frequently.

794
00:39:48,463 --> 00:39:51,185
If enemies spot the player, one might yell, I see him.

795
00:39:51,885 --> 00:39:54,327
The next time that happens, rather than hear, I see him,

796
00:39:54,507 --> 00:39:56,229
again, the player will hear, it's him,

797
00:39:56,489 --> 00:39:57,430
or some other variant.

798
00:39:58,275 --> 00:40:02,556
Not until the bucket has been exhausted by the shovel system does it reset to the top again.

799
00:40:03,156 --> 00:40:09,017
We try to record 10 to 20 different lines per category that might be heard the most to avoid

800
00:40:09,037 --> 00:40:15,279
the player hearing the repetition in any one play session. Sometimes the lines are also written to

801
00:40:15,319 --> 00:40:20,720
be modular so they can be stitched together based on a situation. Not only does this allow for a

802
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,901
variety in the simulation, but it makes the enemies seem alive and intelligent.

803
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:28,180
In The Last of Us, an enemy might say,

804
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,661
hey, you two, go search over there.

805
00:40:31,582 --> 00:40:33,442
Each of these is a separate bucket of lines

806
00:40:33,482 --> 00:40:36,324
that plays back to back, utilizing natural pauses

807
00:40:36,364 --> 00:40:38,405
to make them sound like complete, varied thoughts.

808
00:40:39,045 --> 00:40:41,286
In another scenario, it might play as,

809
00:40:41,386 --> 00:40:44,688
hey, you, go check the alley, or some other variant.

810
00:40:47,054 --> 00:40:49,197
One subtle way we keep things feeling more real

811
00:40:49,557 --> 00:40:51,961
is by avoiding repetition, not just in lines,

812
00:40:52,081 --> 00:40:53,402
but in the voices themselves.

813
00:40:54,183 --> 00:40:56,747
Since we have a limited number of actors voicing our NPCs,

814
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:59,050
we try to make sure they have different voice types,

815
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:00,792
medium, low, et cetera,

816
00:41:01,253 --> 00:41:02,735
so that the player won't hear voices

817
00:41:02,775 --> 00:41:04,257
that sound the same over and over.

818
00:41:05,195 --> 00:41:10,099
Also, as I mentioned, enemies are often initially encountered while they're having a story conversation,

819
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,462
customized to that particular group or area.

820
00:41:13,082 --> 00:41:17,446
We try to keep track of which actor's voice is being used in each conversation, then try

821
00:41:17,486 --> 00:41:21,570
our best to not use that actor in the next setup, further avoiding repetition.

822
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:27,371
A tricky situation that then comes up with these enemy conversations is how to interrupt

823
00:41:27,532 --> 00:41:28,912
these lines that are already playing.

824
00:41:29,673 --> 00:41:33,814
If the player shows up in their vision cones, they have to switch to their systemic dialogue

825
00:41:33,874 --> 00:41:34,735
and go into combat.

826
00:41:35,595 --> 00:41:39,837
So we cut off a line, wait a split second, and then just play the systemic dialogue as

827
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:42,559
if the enemy had interrupted themselves voluntarily.

828
00:41:49,418 --> 00:41:51,260
Take a breath. Who's dead?

829
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,042
The whole crew. The 76th...

830
00:41:59,087 --> 00:42:03,331
For a long time, this rough method was the only way we had to interrupt conversations.

831
00:42:04,112 --> 00:42:09,537
However, the addition of a drivable vehicle in Uncharted 4, which the player could exit at any time,

832
00:42:10,097 --> 00:42:14,001
meant entire sequences of lines might be skipped because the player wanted to explore a little.

833
00:42:15,773 --> 00:42:18,175
This forced us to come up with a more elegant solution

834
00:42:18,215 --> 00:42:20,716
for interrupting and resuming dialogue between Nate

835
00:42:20,756 --> 00:42:23,218
and his buddies, ensuring conversations couldn't

836
00:42:23,258 --> 00:42:24,638
so easily be lost forever.

837
00:42:25,999 --> 00:42:28,060
We recorded more buckets of lines regarding

838
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:31,622
and responding to the player stopping the 4x4 and exiting,

839
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:34,504
then attempting to resume the conversation upon return.

840
00:42:36,445 --> 00:42:38,406
To keep things in line with our story dialogue,

841
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,507
the tone of these interrupts had to be different,

842
00:42:40,928 --> 00:42:41,748
depending on the nature

843
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:43,249
of the characters' current relationships.

844
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:49,348
In the plains of Madagascar, Nate is comfortably exploring with Sully and Sam, so his tone is more casual.

845
00:43:10,265 --> 00:43:15,049
Avery was the most wanted man in the world, so if he was hiding something out here, it makes sense he'd need lookouts.

846
00:43:18,511 --> 00:43:25,637
On the Libertalia island, by contrast, Nate and Elena's relationship is strained, so he's more subdued when he hops out of the car.

847
00:43:26,958 --> 00:43:31,241
Well, Rafe is a good match for Shoreline. He needs their muscle and they need his money.

848
00:43:31,622 --> 00:43:33,903
They do? They seem pretty well stocked.

849
00:43:34,424 --> 00:43:36,125
Shoreline got involved in a couple of sub—

850
00:43:36,165 --> 00:43:36,525
Hold up.

851
00:43:36,866 --> 00:43:37,946
Wait, what? You see something?

852
00:43:43,577 --> 00:43:44,358
Okay, all done.

853
00:43:44,818 --> 00:43:49,801
Yeah, so Shoreline got involved in a couple of civil wars that didn't come out.

854
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:58,287
To make it sound natural when the character stops speaking, we had the actors record glottal stops,

855
00:43:58,807 --> 00:44:01,288
the sound that a person's throat makes when it stops speaking.

856
00:44:01,969 --> 00:44:04,951
These would play to cut off the lines in as natural a way as possible.

857
00:44:06,428 --> 00:44:06,568
But...

858
00:44:08,349 --> 00:44:09,550
Uh...

859
00:44:10,792 --> 00:44:10,932
But...

860
00:44:11,792 --> 00:44:11,933
Um...

861
00:44:14,355 --> 00:44:14,795
But...

862
00:44:16,397 --> 00:44:17,117
Solis were the best.

863
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,742
Sometimes, we edited alternate versions of lines

864
00:44:23,043 --> 00:44:25,545
that would flow more properly when coming out of an interruption.

865
00:44:26,125 --> 00:44:28,187
This meant combing through an entire conversation

866
00:44:28,307 --> 00:44:30,069
and marking which lines needed alts

867
00:44:30,229 --> 00:44:32,331
in case the conversation resumed on that line.

868
00:44:33,277 --> 00:44:38,041
In retrospect, we wish we had purposely recorded alternate versions to restart a conversation,

869
00:44:38,282 --> 00:44:39,863
rather than just edit the originals.

870
00:44:40,404 --> 00:44:43,927
This system is still very new, and we are looking forward to building on it more in

871
00:44:43,967 --> 00:44:44,647
future releases.

872
00:44:46,649 --> 00:44:49,912
There's one last category of dialogue to cover briefly, efforts.

873
00:44:50,713 --> 00:44:56,518
Besides during those wild takes we get at MoCap, we record lots and lots and lots of

874
00:44:56,618 --> 00:44:59,160
efforts of various types with each of our actors.

875
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,940
Mostly because they give feedback to the player

876
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,961
while also helping the characters come alive,

877
00:45:04,341 --> 00:45:06,681
selling all those physical situations like climbing,

878
00:45:06,781 --> 00:45:09,602
fighting, and dying that happen in our games.

879
00:45:11,562 --> 00:45:13,463
Just having breathing from the characters alone,

880
00:45:13,843 --> 00:45:15,543
especially in situations that are tense

881
00:45:15,743 --> 00:45:16,603
or when they're fatigued,

882
00:45:17,023 --> 00:45:19,144
also helps give a sense of what a character's feeling

883
00:45:19,244 --> 00:45:20,484
without them having to state it.

884
00:45:22,324 --> 00:45:24,705
When recording, we have actors chase videos

885
00:45:24,745 --> 00:45:26,725
of a player grappling, fighting, and falling,

886
00:45:27,145 --> 00:45:28,966
so they have context for the sounds they're making.

887
00:45:29,856 --> 00:45:32,738
We often get different sizes, small, medium, large,

888
00:45:33,399 --> 00:45:35,621
of each sound and play the appropriate ones based

889
00:45:35,681 --> 00:45:36,962
on the intensity of the animation.

890
00:45:38,783 --> 00:45:42,326
And as most efforts are vocally stressful, we always record them

891
00:45:42,446 --> 00:45:43,387
at the end of a session.

892
00:45:43,928 --> 00:45:46,610
In fact, we do the same with any shouted material,

893
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:49,252
so we don't blow out an actor's voice in the first hour.

894
00:45:51,634 --> 00:45:54,936
So, as all of these systems and animations

895
00:45:55,036 --> 00:45:57,217
start coming together, that is where the glut

896
00:45:57,297 --> 00:45:59,539
of minor and major changes truly start.

897
00:46:00,339 --> 00:46:02,621
A cut scene or a conversation might work in a vacuum,

898
00:46:03,161 --> 00:46:05,342
but it's not until we get these pieces into the game

899
00:46:05,402 --> 00:46:07,043
that we can truly judge what works.

900
00:46:08,964 --> 00:46:10,805
It's about getting it right on the stick

901
00:46:11,286 --> 00:46:13,907
and feeling it out, and then making sure

902
00:46:13,927 --> 00:46:16,809
the performances remain consistent despite the adjustments.

903
00:46:17,572 --> 00:46:20,354
We continually tweak, swap, and rearrange our dialogue

904
00:46:20,454 --> 00:46:22,756
and animation, sometimes over the course of years,

905
00:46:23,396 --> 00:46:25,097
all to improve the emotional connection

906
00:46:25,357 --> 00:46:27,379
between the player and what's going on around them.

907
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:31,501
First and foremost, not all the content we write

908
00:46:31,521 --> 00:46:33,803
and record works in the final context of the game.

909
00:46:34,684 --> 00:46:36,925
Even if nothing changed in design or animation,

910
00:46:37,245 --> 00:46:39,207
sometimes an emotional beat just feels false.

911
00:46:39,967 --> 00:46:42,329
If possible, we will alter that VO with an edit.

912
00:46:43,161 --> 00:46:47,322
By adding pauses or stealing a breath, sigh, or laugh from somewhere else and cobbling

913
00:46:47,362 --> 00:46:50,203
it onto the line, it can really make moments sound more natural.

914
00:46:52,083 --> 00:46:55,344
Our systemic dialogue might have similar problems when working in context.

915
00:46:56,144 --> 00:46:59,685
Sometimes an AI bucket will fire in a situation that's tonally inappropriate.

916
00:47:00,565 --> 00:47:03,766
Like Nathan Drake's bucket of quips he might spout off any time he knocks a dude out.

917
00:47:04,683 --> 00:47:07,464
If the tone of the game at that point is more serious,

918
00:47:07,924 --> 00:47:11,105
our designers flag that area to suppress all the jokey VO

919
00:47:11,425 --> 00:47:13,566
until it's appropriate for it to play later in the game.

920
00:47:14,426 --> 00:47:16,607
The same goes for all the buddies systemic dialogue.

921
00:47:18,647 --> 00:47:21,588
Another possibility is that a small or not so small

922
00:47:21,648 --> 00:47:23,349
bit of exposition might need to change.

923
00:47:23,989 --> 00:47:25,489
Sometimes it's contained in a cut scene,

924
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:27,230
others it's a gameplay line

925
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:28,911
whose context was altered by design.

926
00:47:29,771 --> 00:47:31,731
Usually something this specific cannot be fixed

927
00:47:31,751 --> 00:47:34,052
with an edit, a new line needs to be recorded.

928
00:47:36,041 --> 00:47:38,603
There are also times when a line is making things confusing,

929
00:47:38,963 --> 00:47:40,164
so it just has to go.

930
00:47:40,964 --> 00:47:42,745
We hold many focus tests to determine

931
00:47:42,766 --> 00:47:45,748
where the pacing drags, augmenting or cutting as needed

932
00:47:45,788 --> 00:47:48,309
to hit the ideal amount of gameplay between story beats.

933
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:51,912
Since we overwrite our levels anyway,

934
00:47:52,352 --> 00:47:55,194
we can usually afford to cut part or all of an exchange

935
00:47:55,634 --> 00:47:57,175
and move another bit of dialogue in

936
00:47:57,235 --> 00:47:59,016
to fill the hole as necessary.

937
00:48:00,918 --> 00:48:02,939
All these adjustments make the game better,

938
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,182
but we also have limits on what we can change.

939
00:48:06,782 --> 00:48:08,163
As the project draws to a close,

940
00:48:08,383 --> 00:48:10,905
the first hard wall we hit is localization.

941
00:48:12,687 --> 00:48:14,548
Localization, for those that might not know,

942
00:48:15,068 --> 00:48:17,330
is the process of translating and re-recording

943
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:19,792
all text and dialogue into dozens of language

944
00:48:19,832 --> 00:48:20,853
for international players.

945
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:26,584
Games at some point have to lock, recording no more new lines and writing no more new

946
00:48:26,624 --> 00:48:31,028
text so that all the existing material can go through this process in time for shipping.

947
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:36,894
The problem is, nowadays, the deadline for localization is not after the game is finished,

948
00:48:37,435 --> 00:48:38,676
it's at least a few months prior.

949
00:48:39,298 --> 00:48:41,378
which, especially since recorded dialogue

950
00:48:41,438 --> 00:48:43,679
is often so hyper-specific to the actions

951
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:46,399
happening on screen, leads to a greater problem

952
00:48:46,439 --> 00:48:48,739
when things in the game evolve after that date.

953
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,080
Because once we've reached the LOC deadline,

954
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,140
nothing new can be recorded.

955
00:48:55,181 --> 00:48:57,601
This phase is when those generic CYA lines

956
00:48:57,741 --> 00:48:58,781
become really handy.

957
00:48:59,441 --> 00:49:01,182
We can use them to patch areas of the game

958
00:49:01,202 --> 00:49:02,482
that evolved after the deadline.

959
00:49:03,102 --> 00:49:04,702
Need to direct a player's attention

960
00:49:04,742 --> 00:49:05,722
to a solution to a puzzle?

961
00:49:06,223 --> 00:49:07,243
Hey, look at this.

962
00:49:08,077 --> 00:49:10,061
Does a character shout out, this way, come on,

963
00:49:10,121 --> 00:49:11,865
but you want to sell that the buddy is following?

964
00:49:12,245 --> 00:49:14,189
Add in a right behind you in response.

965
00:49:15,091 --> 00:49:16,955
This type of dialogue has become so essential,

966
00:49:17,095 --> 00:49:19,159
we intend to record even more lines like it

967
00:49:19,279 --> 00:49:20,061
on future projects.

968
00:49:21,783 --> 00:49:24,464
Like Uncharted 4, we didn't know if the kids' escape

969
00:49:24,504 --> 00:49:26,264
and the manor flashback would feel better

970
00:49:26,305 --> 00:49:29,006
as a tense stealth sequence or a balls-to-the-wall chase

971
00:49:29,026 --> 00:49:29,546
from the police.

972
00:49:30,206 --> 00:49:32,907
We recorded dialogue to support both scenarios

973
00:49:33,047 --> 00:49:35,468
as time was running out, but most of it

974
00:49:35,568 --> 00:49:36,768
was for the stealth version.

975
00:49:37,409 --> 00:49:39,549
Turns out, what worked better was the latter.

976
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:42,250
We ended up covering the majority of the chase

977
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:43,591
using CYA lines.

978
00:49:46,488 --> 00:49:48,849
But sometimes, CYA lines aren't enough.

979
00:49:49,529 --> 00:49:52,089
We need something specific and have to borrow lines

980
00:49:52,129 --> 00:49:53,110
from another part of the game.

981
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:55,510
So we go digging through our database

982
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:57,411
to see what we have that can cover the request.

983
00:49:58,111 --> 00:49:59,812
When picking the line that will be duplicated,

984
00:50:00,112 --> 00:50:03,253
we take into consideration how far apart the new instance is

985
00:50:03,373 --> 00:50:05,193
from the original place the line plays,

986
00:50:05,653 --> 00:50:07,894
so that, again, the player won't notice a repeat.

987
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:15,343
Like this moment in The Last of Us that was covered entirely through CYA lines, reused

988
00:50:15,443 --> 00:50:18,565
systemic dialogue, and a storyline of Ellie's from earlier in the game.

989
00:50:33,617 --> 00:50:36,378
There are even times we've had to change the precise timing

990
00:50:36,418 --> 00:50:38,620
of certain IGCs or cut scenes last minute,

991
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,162
meaning the audio files returned from all the territories

992
00:50:42,482 --> 00:50:44,984
have to be re-edited by hand on our end.

993
00:50:46,885 --> 00:50:49,246
Our localization manager keeps painstaking track

994
00:50:49,286 --> 00:50:50,847
of all these changes so we know

995
00:50:50,867 --> 00:50:52,328
which files need the extra love.

996
00:50:54,349 --> 00:50:56,491
And by the way, tracking all of this madness

997
00:50:56,831 --> 00:50:59,893
by any means necessary is the biggest challenge

998
00:50:59,953 --> 00:51:01,314
of making things the Naughty Dog way.

999
00:51:02,209 --> 00:51:06,551
The efforts of our minimal production staff and various leads are sometimes heroic.

1000
00:51:09,192 --> 00:51:12,934
But as we near the end of production, the biggest limit on us is just time.

1001
00:51:13,754 --> 00:51:17,976
At a certain point, we can only use animations that we've captured or lines that we've recorded.

1002
00:51:18,616 --> 00:51:20,557
If we don't have the material and can't make it up,

1003
00:51:21,117 --> 00:51:26,079
sometimes that means living with tonal shifts or big cuts in material that was painstakingly shot and mocapped.

1004
00:51:27,752 --> 00:51:30,554
Back on Uncharted 1, design made a change to gameplay

1005
00:51:30,594 --> 00:51:32,355
by inserting combat into a sequence

1006
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:34,156
that was originally just quiet traversal.

1007
00:51:34,977 --> 00:51:37,019
Nate and Elena casually walked into an area

1008
00:51:37,139 --> 00:51:38,800
in the cutscene and discovered a jet ski.

1009
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,942
They weren't out of breath or recovering

1010
00:51:40,982 --> 00:51:42,363
from a tense combat situation.

1011
00:51:43,063 --> 00:51:45,945
But the gameplay needed a spike of energy for the player

1012
00:51:46,226 --> 00:51:49,028
and it worked, even though it caused a tonal mismatch

1013
00:51:49,048 --> 00:51:50,089
with the cutscene that followed.

1014
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:53,243
Still, that late in the development process,

1015
00:51:53,403 --> 00:51:54,664
we could not reshoot the scene.

1016
00:51:55,244 --> 00:51:57,206
So this was logged as an example

1017
00:51:57,326 --> 00:51:59,127
of how we could improve maintaining tone

1018
00:51:59,167 --> 00:52:00,968
when going into a cut scene in the future.

1019
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:06,412
On Uncharted 4, we were working on an epic sword fight

1020
00:52:06,453 --> 00:52:07,253
near the end of the game,

1021
00:52:07,794 --> 00:52:10,155
and we had planned to introduce those new mechanics

1022
00:52:10,275 --> 00:52:12,137
during the manor flashback with the kids.

1023
00:52:12,918 --> 00:52:15,700
We even mo-capped and recorded a whole bunch of material to make it happen.

1024
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:19,741
But when we looked at the amount of work it would take to polish and script all those animations,

1025
00:52:20,062 --> 00:52:22,122
and the time we had left to finish everything else in the game,

1026
00:52:22,623 --> 00:52:24,463
our directors made a hard call and cut it.

1027
00:52:25,204 --> 00:52:27,725
So the player comes to the ending sword fight untrained,

1028
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:30,866
and can possibly be emotionally divested from the sequence

1029
00:52:30,946 --> 00:52:33,367
as they struggle to learn new mechanics near the end of the game.

1030
00:52:36,065 --> 00:52:39,166
But if we catch an issue early enough,

1031
00:52:39,686 --> 00:52:42,468
it has been possible to make the hard choices required

1032
00:52:42,608 --> 00:52:46,370
to maintain consistent tone and performances in a sequence that

1033
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:47,030
needs adjustment.

1034
00:52:48,951 --> 00:52:51,252
Nearing the end of The Last of Us, one of our designers

1035
00:52:51,312 --> 00:52:52,873
pointed out a big flaw we'd overlooked.

1036
00:52:53,413 --> 00:52:55,754
The Firefly Hospital culminated with a cut scene

1037
00:52:55,814 --> 00:52:58,155
where Joel charged into the operating room to save Ellie.

1038
00:52:59,207 --> 00:53:02,148
In that scene, he kills the doctor and eventually Marlene right there,

1039
00:53:02,488 --> 00:53:04,409
and we smash cut to him and Ellie driving away.

1040
00:53:05,169 --> 00:53:09,511
It was a great cut scene, and the performances we got out of it, as written, were excellent.

1041
00:53:11,352 --> 00:53:16,434
The problem was, as the designer pointed out, the player missed out on a big emotional payoff

1042
00:53:16,654 --> 00:53:20,936
that we hadn't even thought about. After carrying Joel's daughter at the beginning of the game,

1043
00:53:21,316 --> 00:53:23,877
the player was set up to expect an echo of that event.

1044
00:53:25,472 --> 00:53:27,853
that Joel would be carrying Ellie to safety at the end,

1045
00:53:28,233 --> 00:53:30,494
redeeming him some aspect of his former loss.

1046
00:53:32,135 --> 00:53:35,317
So, with some hesitation, we looked at what it might take

1047
00:53:35,397 --> 00:53:37,458
to salvage what we could from the existing cutscene.

1048
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:42,141
By keeping the Marlene animation and just picking up Joel,

1049
00:53:42,601 --> 00:53:46,223
now carrying Ellie, we were able to move the main story beats

1050
00:53:46,243 --> 00:53:48,225
of the cutscene into the hospital parking garage.

1051
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:52,391
This allowed for a brand new ending sequence where Joel,

1052
00:53:52,591 --> 00:53:55,273
with Joel carrying Ellie past dozens of Firefly soldiers,

1053
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:59,736
who we were assured would refrain from shooting Joel

1054
00:54:00,136 --> 00:54:02,898
because seriously he was carrying the cure for mankind.

1055
00:54:05,499 --> 00:54:07,801
So that is what we recorded all of our dialogue for.

1056
00:54:08,521 --> 00:54:11,783
And then after localization locked, it changed again.

1057
00:54:13,275 --> 00:54:15,237
There wasn't enough tension if Joel could just walk out

1058
00:54:15,277 --> 00:54:17,479
of the hospital with Ellie, so the actions

1059
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:19,201
of the Firefly soldiers were revamped

1060
00:54:19,281 --> 00:54:20,122
so they could attack him.

1061
00:54:20,762 --> 00:54:22,344
But that didn't match up with any

1062
00:54:22,364 --> 00:54:23,404
of the dialogue we'd recorded.

1063
00:54:26,607 --> 00:54:29,370
It took digging through NPC material we had recorded

1064
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:31,432
for other parts of the game to make this moment

1065
00:54:31,592 --> 00:54:34,214
and the performances in it feel as equally polished

1066
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:35,255
as others in the game.

1067
00:54:37,183 --> 00:54:39,585
ultimately was totally worth sacrificing some mocap

1068
00:54:39,645 --> 00:54:42,468
and scrambling through folders of VO to create an experience

1069
00:54:42,729 --> 00:54:44,891
that would capitalize on player empathy to that degree.

1070
00:54:47,794 --> 00:54:49,776
So we do a lot of crazy shit.

1071
00:54:51,137 --> 00:54:52,398
And I'd just like to emphasize,

1072
00:54:52,659 --> 00:54:54,260
the way we do it isn't the only way

1073
00:54:54,701 --> 00:54:57,083
or even the right way to pull off realistic performances,

1074
00:54:57,383 --> 00:54:59,986
especially depending on your team size, budget, et cetera.

1075
00:55:00,886 --> 00:55:04,169
But the level of flexibility we allow for story and gameplay

1076
00:55:04,189 --> 00:55:06,432
to influence each other during development

1077
00:55:06,832 --> 00:55:09,134
is why we feel we're able to strike a balance that we're

1078
00:55:09,154 --> 00:55:09,475
proud of.

1079
00:55:11,328 --> 00:55:13,589
And it's also why executing these performances

1080
00:55:13,709 --> 00:55:16,189
requires constant collaboration and dedication

1081
00:55:16,269 --> 00:55:18,170
from every discipline on the Naughty Dog team.

1082
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:21,751
Writing, acting, rendering, audio, concept, character,

1083
00:55:21,831 --> 00:55:24,031
programming, animation, design, lighting, production,

1084
00:55:24,271 --> 00:55:27,092
even IT and ops, it takes a veritable metropolis

1085
00:55:27,352 --> 00:55:29,452
of talented men and women to make the performances

1086
00:55:29,712 --> 00:55:31,493
that the player can feel when the controller

1087
00:55:31,513 --> 00:55:32,073
is in their hands.

1088
00:55:34,173 --> 00:55:37,334
It is a constant struggle, but if we can truly move you

1089
00:55:37,874 --> 00:55:40,034
and maybe surprise you, then for us,

1090
00:55:40,075 --> 00:55:40,835
that's art worth making.

1091
00:55:42,025 --> 00:55:42,271
Thank you.
