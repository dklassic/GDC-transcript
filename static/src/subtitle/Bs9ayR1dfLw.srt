00:00:06,045 --> 00:00:09,289
Hello, my name is Julian Quijano and this is Fandom Ready.

2
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,753
First of all, before starting, I need to point out,

3
00:00:12,873 --> 00:00:16,557
as you may have realized by now, that English is not

4
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:18,819
my first language, so expect some mistakes.

5
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:19,840
I hope you can excuse me.

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,644
If you have any question, feel free to ask it in the chat.

7
00:00:24,986 --> 00:00:27,448
I'm the creative director at Beautiful Glitch.

8
00:00:29,235 --> 00:00:31,616
We're an indie studio in San Ivercelona, in Spain.

9
00:00:31,757 --> 00:00:33,958
You can follow us in Instagram and Twitter.

10
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:35,499
There's a handle in there.

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,721
And we are the creators of Monster Prom.

12
00:00:38,361 --> 00:00:40,803
Monster Prom is a multiplayer narrative adventure

13
00:00:41,023 --> 00:00:43,385
with latency mechanics and party game mechanics.

14
00:00:43,865 --> 00:00:44,546
And it's more than a game.

15
00:00:44,746 --> 00:00:45,346
It's a franchise.

16
00:00:45,687 --> 00:00:48,349
As we have a content DLC called Second Term

17
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:51,431
and a sequel we recently released called Monster Camp.

18
00:00:51,731 --> 00:00:53,813
And we are planning more sequels to go.

19
00:00:54,612 --> 00:00:57,357
But today we are talking more than just video games.

20
00:00:57,378 --> 00:00:58,299
We are talking about fandom.

21
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,745
So we want to show your fandom, which is wonderful.

22
00:01:03,072 --> 00:01:09,639
you can see here. And not only that, we want to show you some numbers that we believe are tied

23
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,805
to having a fandom. Because often we hear that it's better to have a fan than just a consumer.

24
00:01:14,925 --> 00:01:21,472
And we agree. But we also think it's important for the purpose of this talk to show some numbers

25
00:01:21,492 --> 00:01:24,275
that we believe are tied in some ways to having fans.

26
00:01:25,276 --> 00:01:27,338
and not just an audience.

27
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,961
Stuff like a very high conversion rate on our products

28
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:34,144
that goes to show the loyalty of our fans to the fiction.

29
00:01:34,164 --> 00:01:38,247
High average in Kickstarter campaigns

30
00:01:38,327 --> 00:01:40,509
as goes to show that people is very willing

31
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:42,411
to pay more than just the price of the game

32
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,834
because they are very invested in the game.

33
00:01:47,484 --> 00:01:52,509
And even social media, where we have more than 50,000 followers both on Twitter and

34
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:56,112
Instagram, having more than 1 million likes in Instagram in 2019.

35
00:01:56,273 --> 00:02:01,218
And this is not to unharm, it's for two reasons that I'm showing you this.

36
00:02:01,738 --> 00:02:02,158
For once...

37
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:03,660
Sorry.

38
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:05,101
For once...

39
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:11,637
It's just in case that you don't know Mozart Brum or Beautiful Glitch, I think it's important to

40
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:17,539
show you our credentials because you are here listening to a talk we are giving about fandoms

41
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:25,522
and whatnot and so I think some of these numbers and these pictures goes to show that indeed we

42
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:32,584
have a fiction ourself that has grown its own wonderful big fandom and also it goes to show

43
00:02:32,604 --> 00:02:33,244
the value of it.

44
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:42,654
since we are spending now half an hour on what effectively is a series of tricks and

45
00:02:42,694 --> 00:02:48,297
advice on how to turn your fiction into fertile grounds for a fandom to grow.

46
00:02:49,858 --> 00:02:51,699
Because this is what this talk is about.

47
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:57,722
What over the years, thanks to Monster Prom and observation and our and other fandoms.

48
00:02:59,932 --> 00:03:10,295
insights we have come up with on how we believe that, aside of, of course, crafting a great

49
00:03:10,335 --> 00:03:19,219
product, you can do to, let's say, increase the chances for a fandom to grow around the

50
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:27,002
creation you are working in. So, before going into the specific insights, I want to talk a bit

51
00:03:27,122 --> 00:03:28,162
about, oh, sorry.

52
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,380
Here, I want to talk a bit about the process

53
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,160
of becoming a fan.

54
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:37,362
I'm sure a lot of us are fans of different fandoms.

55
00:03:39,282 --> 00:03:41,203
And so I want you to think on the process

56
00:03:42,363 --> 00:03:45,164
because it will be useful in here later.

57
00:03:46,324 --> 00:03:48,465
So we start as strangers, strangers in the sense

58
00:03:48,485 --> 00:03:50,565
that we know nothing about the fiction.

59
00:03:51,262 --> 00:03:58,130
Then we receive a first impact, right? Someone talks to us about the fiction or we see something

60
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:04,937
in somewhere and then we go into mere consumption. We read a book, play a game, watch the episode of

61
00:04:04,997 --> 00:04:12,345
a TV show and maybe we have some interest after that and we discuss it a bit with friends or even

62
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:12,906
leave a review.

63
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:18,523
Maybe then we decide to consume more of the main products,

64
00:04:18,623 --> 00:04:20,645
like watching more episodes of the TV show,

65
00:04:20,705 --> 00:04:22,007
playing more games of the franchise,

66
00:04:22,047 --> 00:04:23,288
reading more books of the series.

67
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:26,052
And maybe our interest keeps growing.

68
00:04:26,152 --> 00:04:28,615
So we are not just only discussing,

69
00:04:28,675 --> 00:04:30,657
now we are defending the fiction.

70
00:04:30,977 --> 00:04:33,260
Now we are even recommending it to other people.

71
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,022
And slowly you can see how

72
00:04:35,883 --> 00:04:38,305
As a consumer, you are starting to have more and more value

73
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:41,188
for the creator because for once, you are, of course,

74
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:43,269
consuming more products, but you are also

75
00:04:43,329 --> 00:04:46,252
even helping the creator in spreading the word

76
00:04:46,312 --> 00:04:48,614
and getting more consumers.

77
00:04:49,895 --> 00:04:52,478
And then we go into the deeper levels,

78
00:04:52,598 --> 00:04:55,580
which I think what comes next depends

79
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,902
a lot on who you are as a fan.

80
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,925
And it goes to show that there's many ways of interacting

81
00:05:00,965 --> 00:05:01,265
with a fan.

82
00:05:02,498 --> 00:05:06,841
Maybe you go into full immersion and you observe all the information out there about the fiction,

83
00:05:06,901 --> 00:05:12,665
like wikis and theories. Maybe you want to consume more products other than the main ones.

84
00:05:13,025 --> 00:05:18,709
So you are now not only playing games on the franchise, but you, I don't know, you bought a

85
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:23,793
body pillow case. Maybe you go into socialization, meaning that you become an active participant

86
00:05:23,973 --> 00:05:28,657
in social circles around the fandom and you meet new acquaintances and even friends.

87
00:05:29,257 --> 00:05:30,238
Maybe you want to create.

88
00:05:31,317 --> 00:05:38,683
And so depending what's the craft you like, you draw fan art, write fanfics, do cosplay,

89
00:05:40,564 --> 00:05:47,749
make memes, craft theories, whatever speaks to you. Or maybe you do a number of things. It's

90
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:53,734
whatever suits you as a fan, again. And this is a process, again, I think we all know, but I think

91
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:58,617
it's interesting to now flip it and think how it goes for the creator. And for the

92
00:05:59,663 --> 00:06:05,846
Benefit of this talk and to more easily convey the points and insights we have come up with,

93
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:12,129
I would establish three different parts with three different goals.

94
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:20,953
For once, as creators, we need to create an enticing first bite. Like this means

95
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,143
to make the shallow levels of your fiction

96
00:06:26,683 --> 00:06:28,144
very accessible and appealing.

97
00:06:28,184 --> 00:06:31,806
So a stranger will feel, you know,

98
00:06:32,486 --> 00:06:35,868
enticed to that first interaction with your fiction.

99
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:42,132
Then you have the goal of achieving a smooth transition

100
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:42,973
from bite to binge.

101
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:51,105
This means that create the different levels and parts of your fiction in a way that, yeah,

102
00:06:51,165 --> 00:06:55,208
you get that first bite, but then before you realize you get the second bite, the third bite,

103
00:06:55,268 --> 00:07:01,333
and then suddenly you are in directly, sorry, you are actually binging. And then when you're

104
00:07:01,373 --> 00:07:05,876
binging on the deep levels, I think there's also a goal, which is managing for people to binge from

105
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:06,276
their heart.

106
00:07:07,296 --> 00:07:24,983
And what this means to us is that people that are on the deep levels are not just spending a lot of time and that's it with your fiction, but they're also starting to connect in deeper levels of values, identity, emotions, so they truly connect with your fiction.

107
00:07:30,573 --> 00:07:38,298
Basically, all this builds on the idea, on the notion that right now most fictions,

108
00:07:38,638 --> 00:07:45,002
and I recommend yours if you can make it so it goes this way, are actually multi-layered.

109
00:07:45,302 --> 00:07:48,885
Multi-layered in the sense that there's many layers of consumption available

110
00:07:49,525 --> 00:07:56,069
and are accessible for someone that wants to go in it casually and deep levels for

111
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:57,550
the person that wants to become a fan.

112
00:07:58,372 --> 00:08:02,335
And I say, before checking specific tricks, that...

113
00:08:02,355 --> 00:08:03,536
Sorry, one second.

114
00:08:07,638 --> 00:08:12,242
It's good for a creator to ask oneself

115
00:08:12,602 --> 00:08:15,103
if the creation has opportunities

116
00:08:15,164 --> 00:08:18,366
for all of these multi-layer levels of consumption.

117
00:08:18,726 --> 00:08:19,606
These mean many things.

118
00:08:20,407 --> 00:08:22,148
Like, for instance, some questions

119
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,850
that you could ask yourself as a creator of a game.

120
00:08:25,564 --> 00:08:30,648
Are you building not only a great game, but good spaces for debate, like a Discord server?

121
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:39,234
This is maybe dumb, but do you have at least one character that's very easy to cosplay,

122
00:08:39,294 --> 00:08:47,100
so people that's maybe not very skilled in cosplay can still feel comfortable cosplaying

123
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,501
one character? Are you...

124
00:08:50,222 --> 00:08:54,084
Karim, sorry, Karim for your community spaces.

125
00:08:54,404 --> 00:08:57,865
So your fandom is an enjoyable place to find

126
00:08:57,885 --> 00:09:01,086
and to meet new people that loves the same fiction than you.

127
00:09:01,766 --> 00:09:04,047
Are you, the theme is open for Sonas

128
00:09:04,107 --> 00:09:06,007
like Monster Prom has Monster Sonas.

129
00:09:06,147 --> 00:09:09,548
Is the theme you have chosen open for this kind of content?

130
00:09:11,004 --> 00:09:14,565
Do you have mysteries that will lead people into many theories?

131
00:09:14,925 --> 00:09:17,146
And of course, you don't need to fish for all of this.

132
00:09:17,866 --> 00:09:18,946
Each fiction is different.

133
00:09:19,227 --> 00:09:25,608
But I think it's useful to spend some time reflecting on if you have opportunities for this.

134
00:09:26,409 --> 00:09:30,230
Like, open your fiction to this type of multi-layer consumption.

135
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,230
But enough of that.

136
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,611
So, provided these three goals...

137
00:09:37,325 --> 00:09:41,468
come up with a number of insights, advice, tricks

138
00:09:41,728 --> 00:09:44,330
to manage, to achieve these three goals.

139
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,231
And we found like eight to 10.

140
00:09:46,531 --> 00:09:49,953
But of course, because we have only 30 minutes today,

141
00:09:51,114 --> 00:09:55,937
we will focus on one trick or one insight per level.

142
00:09:56,177 --> 00:09:57,098
Let's start with the first one,

143
00:09:57,438 --> 00:09:59,920
which is getting that first bite.

144
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:05,223
So, this is ways

145
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:10,269
to get a stranger to have a first interaction

146
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:10,990
with your fandom.

147
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:15,872
We found three potential ways of maximizing

148
00:10:15,952 --> 00:10:17,553
the chances of this happening,

149
00:10:17,953 --> 00:10:19,594
which are exploring theme trends,

150
00:10:20,694 --> 00:10:23,236
offering a big first choice, a first big choice,

151
00:10:24,516 --> 00:10:25,357
or having a high pitch.

152
00:10:25,717 --> 00:10:27,898
And now we are focusing on the second one,

153
00:10:28,678 --> 00:10:29,639
offering a first big choice.

154
00:10:30,579 --> 00:10:30,679
So.

155
00:10:32,235 --> 00:10:35,358
This idea is based on a market, all the marketing trick,

156
00:10:35,578 --> 00:10:37,700
or at least that's how I learned about that

157
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,282
when I was studying advertising.

158
00:10:40,303 --> 00:10:45,648
And, sorry, it's based on the idea of

159
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:48,310
when you're creating something

160
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,292
and you want to market it to an audience,

161
00:10:51,173 --> 00:10:53,935
it's very important to frame the perception of that audience.

162
00:10:54,796 --> 00:10:57,298
This is easier understood if we put an example.

163
00:10:58,045 --> 00:11:02,988
Let's say that we are now trying to sell soda instead of making a game or creating whatever.

164
00:11:04,229 --> 00:11:09,772
So you can ask people, do you want to drink soda? Yes or no? But the thing is, 50% of those

165
00:11:10,272 --> 00:11:14,575
options are not of our interest. We don't want people choosing, I don't want to drink soda.

166
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:20,158
So the idea is to override that question and go into a different question, that first big choice,

167
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:26,142
that kind of throws people into already thinking in terms of drinking the soda.

168
00:11:26,442 --> 00:11:30,684
For instance, it would be like, which soda speaks to you?

169
00:11:31,284 --> 00:11:34,105
Sweet strawberry soda, exotic papaya soda,

170
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:36,666
or super cool blue flavor, whatever that is.

171
00:11:37,426 --> 00:11:42,448
And you can see the idea is to override the drink soda,

172
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,269
yes, no, and get people just wondering,

173
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,709
okay, which one I would drink.

174
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,110
That this is not like a magic trick

175
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:53,111
that will everyone drinking soda, but it has an effect.

176
00:11:53,532 --> 00:11:54,592
It's, let's say it,

177
00:11:56,398 --> 00:12:00,721
helps you to make your audience, people,

178
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:05,283
to go past that first wall of disinterest

179
00:12:05,984 --> 00:12:08,345
and actually check what this soda is about.

180
00:12:09,205 --> 00:12:13,308
And this, which feels very specific

181
00:12:13,428 --> 00:12:15,029
and soda-centric right now,

182
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:16,569
and then basically means

183
00:12:17,495 --> 00:12:19,958
Sorry, it's basically present in many fictions too.

184
00:12:20,538 --> 00:12:22,841
Like for instance, the thing on some popular ones

185
00:12:23,341 --> 00:12:26,204
is like a Harry Potter, which instead of telling you,

186
00:12:26,264 --> 00:12:27,205
do you like Harry Potter?

187
00:12:27,265 --> 00:12:27,785
Yes or no.

188
00:12:29,287 --> 00:12:30,248
Do you want to read it?

189
00:12:31,289 --> 00:12:31,589
Sorry.

190
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:36,634
It directly says, in which house would you be?

191
00:12:36,934 --> 00:12:39,037
Slytherin, Gryffindor, Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff.

192
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:45,028
And again, instead of thinking I am interested in Harry Potter, or even if you know you are not

193
00:12:45,088 --> 00:12:52,020
interested, you feel a bit enticed to check which one is yours. Right? Or even with video games.

194
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:58,628
I myself have never played Fire Emblem, nor do I have an interest in it.

195
00:12:59,369 --> 00:13:02,872
Sorry, not sorry, but to which they are owned, I think they say in English.

196
00:13:03,473 --> 00:13:08,137
And the thing is, recently they released Three Houses, which was very popular.

197
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:11,620
And it did the same thing, basically also with houses.

198
00:13:12,516 --> 00:13:19,741
and it actually worked because instead of saying pass, I don't want to play any Fire Emblem,

199
00:13:19,881 --> 00:13:26,305
or I don't want even to check what Fire Emblem is about, they got me checking the houses because

200
00:13:26,866 --> 00:13:33,430
I wanted to know which houses I would choose. And again, no magic trick. I didn't end up.

201
00:13:34,352 --> 00:13:35,513
playing Fire Emblem.

202
00:13:35,793 --> 00:13:37,154
But it's the first time in my life

203
00:13:37,314 --> 00:13:40,117
that I actually care enough to check about the game.

204
00:13:40,617 --> 00:13:42,519
And that's a huge first step

205
00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:44,541
that we are trying to achieve as creators.

206
00:13:45,322 --> 00:13:47,964
So the power of a first big choice.

207
00:13:49,105 --> 00:13:50,607
Give me one second.

208
00:13:51,207 --> 00:13:53,669
I will sum it up this way,

209
00:13:54,350 --> 00:14:00,756
which is human beings are often like,

210
00:14:02,429 --> 00:14:05,732
They tend, sorry, human beings tend to organize information

211
00:14:05,993 --> 00:14:09,676
in categories and groups because that makes the information

212
00:14:09,736 --> 00:14:13,740
more easily digestible, digestible.

213
00:14:14,301 --> 00:14:19,406
And so these create shortcuts and make easier

214
00:14:19,486 --> 00:14:21,488
to understand complex structures,

215
00:14:21,568 --> 00:14:23,890
like the fiction you are trying to sell, for instance.

216
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:30,285
And so we are also appealed and attracted to these kind of informational categories.

217
00:14:30,825 --> 00:14:36,993
We are like, when we see them, we want to decode them. So there's a power in that.

218
00:14:38,665 --> 00:14:40,846
In Monster Prom, there's no houses or teams,

219
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,347
but we have the characters.

220
00:14:42,367 --> 00:14:44,188
You need to choose between six love interest.

221
00:14:44,388 --> 00:14:47,569
And so we did this into a lesser degree,

222
00:14:48,009 --> 00:14:51,311
but the six characters have clear school tropes.

223
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:53,352
They have a clear monster types,

224
00:14:53,472 --> 00:14:58,094
and they're even minus one are super clearly coded

225
00:14:58,174 --> 00:15:00,475
with colors that are very,

226
00:15:01,675 --> 00:15:07,137
present in the character design. So you have the red demon who's a bad boy, the green gorgon who's

227
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:13,239
a mean girl, the blue ghost who's a party animal, or the purple vampire who's a hipster.

228
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,941
And so now that we have understood this, the next question would be like, can this become

229
00:15:21,061 --> 00:15:26,683
more powerful? And I think yes, with what I call sexy themes. And this is a

230
00:15:27,572 --> 00:15:32,828
funny way of saying universal unrecognizable categories or symbols.

231
00:15:33,795 --> 00:15:36,536
And as we can see here, one example, there's like Zodiac.

232
00:15:37,296 --> 00:15:40,477
Just if you are wondering, this Zodiac thirst

233
00:15:40,617 --> 00:15:42,257
is nothing about this talk specifically,

234
00:15:42,297 --> 00:15:45,498
but just as an example, so I can show you

235
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:49,399
that we're not only sharing this information,

236
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:50,780
but we applied ourselves.

237
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,081
This is like some concept we have been playing around

238
00:15:54,101 --> 00:15:56,802
around the idea of a sexy thing, which is Zodiac signs.

239
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:59,863
And I will show you some concepts, sorry,

240
00:16:00,183 --> 00:16:01,063
when I'm explaining this.

241
00:16:02,063 --> 00:16:02,183
So.

242
00:16:04,872 --> 00:16:12,759
These sexy themes are stuff like zodiac signs, but also elements, planets, deadly scenes,

243
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:22,246
major arcana. You can think of probably of many universal categories that people easily recognize.

244
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:27,371
And you can also think on many fictions that use that, like Sailor Moon with the planets,

245
00:16:27,471 --> 00:16:30,613
Homestuck and Saint Seiya with the zodiac signs, Avatar with the elements.

246
00:16:31,692 --> 00:16:34,214
And again, it has the power of this first big choice,

247
00:16:34,774 --> 00:16:39,979
but also is so freaking recognizable and universal.

248
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,102
And even sometimes people have one of these symbols assigned

249
00:16:44,342 --> 00:16:47,245
or they previously chose which one they really like,

250
00:16:48,005 --> 00:16:52,209
that you can even go further into overriding

251
00:16:52,289 --> 00:16:53,690
the first disinterest.

252
00:16:54,664 --> 00:16:57,626
that people maybe even want to check theirs.

253
00:16:57,866 --> 00:16:59,948
Like, I'm a Capricorn, and then I

254
00:17:00,028 --> 00:17:02,810
tend to check the Capricorn characters when

255
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:05,752
the characters are coded with the zodiac signs.

256
00:17:06,673 --> 00:17:09,095
It's, again, the power of this first big choice.

257
00:17:12,605 --> 00:17:20,236
But it's not only about offering the first big choice or using universal and recognizable themes

258
00:17:20,736 --> 00:17:26,404
that work as categories, but also you need to, of course, translate these universal categories,

259
00:17:26,544 --> 00:17:29,528
symbols, etc., into something that feels yours, part of your fiction.

260
00:17:29,908 --> 00:17:31,069
And again, of course, you are not,

261
00:17:31,269 --> 00:17:33,349
this is not something that you need to do,

262
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:35,810
but these are like advice insights.

263
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:39,990
And I would say that it's worth checking

264
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,031
if this makes sense with your fiction,

265
00:17:42,071 --> 00:17:43,891
but if so, I think it helps.

266
00:17:44,691 --> 00:17:48,172
So yeah, making it yours.

267
00:17:49,192 --> 00:17:52,113
The goal here, I think is when you create these categories,

268
00:17:52,173 --> 00:17:53,133
this first big choice,

269
00:17:54,133 --> 00:17:57,814
it's good if the options have distinctive,

270
00:17:58,414 --> 00:17:59,434
visual distinction.

271
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:07,564
and a clarity of tropes. You need to make the choice very distinct from each other so people

272
00:18:07,764 --> 00:18:15,511
feel even more pushed like subconsciously into choosing one that speaks to them.

273
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:29,698
In the end, it's a lot about that, about our tendency to seek a sense of belonging,

274
00:18:30,018 --> 00:18:34,542
even if it means belonging to one group, house, category, character in a fiction,

275
00:18:34,562 --> 00:18:40,207
and our sense of identity and how we are continuously defining ourselves and looking

276
00:18:40,227 --> 00:18:42,288
for ways of defining ourselves. And so we...

277
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:51,473
carry these symbols, for instance, in a way that has some strange and intriguing power.

278
00:18:51,653 --> 00:18:57,136
Like, again, the zodiac signs. I myself am a Capricorn, and I don't believe in astrology,

279
00:18:57,236 --> 00:19:02,439
but I carry the sign in a strange way because it's a sign that was assigned to me at birth,

280
00:19:02,999 --> 00:19:09,942
and I have built some connection. And so there's at least an intriguing power to that, and I think

281
00:19:10,623 --> 00:19:12,423
fictions can benefit from using it.

282
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,275
So to sum it up,

283
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:20,560
sexy themes are universal and recognizable.

284
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,862
They appeal to a sense of identity

285
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,383
and the need to define oneself.

286
00:19:24,843 --> 00:19:27,545
And they throw a complete stranger

287
00:19:27,725 --> 00:19:30,687
into checking the fiction and doing a whole dive within it.

288
00:19:31,108 --> 00:19:33,569
It's building yummy choices

289
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,912
that lead into a strong sense of belonging and identity.

290
00:19:38,173 --> 00:19:40,074
And again, overriding that first part.

291
00:19:40,467 --> 00:19:44,449
turning getting that first byte. So, let's move on to the next part.

292
00:19:47,711 --> 00:19:54,654
The immersion. So, the smooth transition from byte to binge. And these are insights on many

293
00:19:55,155 --> 00:20:00,557
degrees of depth from the byte to the binge. For instance, twisting the trope is something that

294
00:20:00,937 --> 00:20:04,839
in my opinion is closer to the byte. And the one we are checking now,

295
00:20:04,979 --> 00:20:07,801
which is the power of the relatable, is closer to the binge.

296
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:16,854
What's that about? Let's think for a moment on a TV show. It's Space Bounty Hunters, right?

297
00:20:18,895 --> 00:20:23,256
You have the first episode and it starts with a brawl so you can see all of these characters

298
00:20:23,336 --> 00:20:30,138
like striding to cool fighting. It's selling the action of the TV show.

299
00:20:31,078 --> 00:20:34,879
And that's all cool, but I think it's even cooler when a TV show does something different,

300
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:40,441
like you watch once on minutes and the actual show starts with them a bit before that. So you

301
00:20:40,481 --> 00:20:48,003
have them ordering food at an intergalactic pool for dinner, restaurant, whatever, or dinner.

302
00:20:48,523 --> 00:20:53,144
And so you can see them like what they order, how they eat, what they drink,

303
00:20:53,204 --> 00:20:56,285
or even them having a menial conversation about anything.

304
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,890
And I believe there's a power in that.

305
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:03,391
Actually, this that I am describing

306
00:21:03,431 --> 00:21:06,632
is very similar to the first scene of Preserver Dogs, where

307
00:21:06,652 --> 00:21:09,252
you have fantastic characters, in the sense

308
00:21:09,272 --> 00:21:11,053
that they are not your every man,

309
00:21:11,113 --> 00:21:12,673
but criminals in this case.

310
00:21:13,113 --> 00:21:15,174
And you have them eating at a dinner

311
00:21:15,294 --> 00:21:17,474
and discussing about, if I remember correctly,

312
00:21:17,534 --> 00:21:19,295
the tipping system in the United States.

313
00:21:21,495 --> 00:21:23,136
And it was a great choice, I think,

314
00:21:24,623 --> 00:21:27,285
It painted you the characters in a very clear way,

315
00:21:27,345 --> 00:21:31,529
but also in a way that was relatable in the sense

316
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:33,590
that they were doing something that even if there were

317
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:36,893
criminals or space pirates, as they will be in this TV show,

318
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,975
they still felt close.

319
00:21:40,616 --> 00:21:42,798
And there's a power on making stuff relatable.

320
00:21:42,838 --> 00:21:48,242
I think it's obvious on how it grounds your fiction in what

321
00:21:48,342 --> 00:21:53,246
can be recognized and seen as something close to us.

322
00:21:53,769 --> 00:22:01,551
So I think there's a value in mixing the fantastic and the mundane. The fantastic is also good.

323
00:22:01,932 --> 00:22:06,393
Like, of course, you can create something that's completely mundane and that's completely fine,

324
00:22:06,913 --> 00:22:13,535
but many fictions benefit, I think, from having fantastic setups. Some people ask us, like,

325
00:22:14,715 --> 00:22:19,417
why Monster Prime are monsters? Because they're like comedic exaggerations of myself and my

326
00:22:19,477 --> 00:22:22,138
friends when we were on our 20s, most of the characters.

327
00:22:22,937 --> 00:22:25,261
not Miranda, I don't know any person like Miranda.

328
00:22:26,604 --> 00:22:27,365
Luckily, I guess.

329
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:30,952
But the thing is.

330
00:22:34,398 --> 00:22:42,726
We chose to make them monsters for no good reason other than monsters are cool and they're popular.

331
00:22:43,146 --> 00:22:50,053
And so yeah, there's value in a fantastic setup and nothing against Miranda, but at least as a

332
00:22:50,093 --> 00:22:56,139
real person, I think it's at least one I would want to be close to. The character is funny.

333
00:22:58,568 --> 00:23:02,831
So we know that there's value in the fantastic, but also it's good to space them on the underneath.

334
00:23:02,971 --> 00:23:09,256
People want to see this fantastic hero. No matter how epic your story is, people connect with and

335
00:23:09,316 --> 00:23:14,439
care for what's humane, for what's relatable. And so I think you need to put that into your

336
00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:15,640
fiction no matter what.

337
00:23:19,242 --> 00:23:20,663
Another good example we talked before,

338
00:23:20,963 --> 00:23:24,524
and I think it talks about another value of this,

339
00:23:24,764 --> 00:23:25,624
is Harry Potter again.

340
00:23:25,944 --> 00:23:27,324
Because many people,

341
00:23:27,384 --> 00:23:29,625
even if they didn't care that much about Harry Potter

342
00:23:29,685 --> 00:23:31,926
and the ones that care, of course did,

343
00:23:33,466 --> 00:23:36,787
has wondered what if I was in Hogwarts, right?

344
00:23:38,147 --> 00:23:41,228
Because Hogwarts, aside of being a magic school,

345
00:23:41,288 --> 00:23:43,689
was a school and that's something we can relate to.

346
00:23:44,527 --> 00:23:50,389
and that let us do something very important for a fiction to make people do, which is projection.

347
00:23:50,749 --> 00:23:58,210
I think it's very good that your fiction manages to make the audience project themselves

348
00:23:58,691 --> 00:24:06,752
into the fiction's world. And that's thanks to having, sorry, details, parts of the fiction,

349
00:24:06,872 --> 00:24:10,633
or a big part that's mundane, that's something that we can relate to. So...

350
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,784
You want your fiction to be enough fantastic,

351
00:24:16,824 --> 00:24:18,906
so you want to imagine yourself in there,

352
00:24:19,307 --> 00:24:21,770
but enough mundane so you can imagine yourself in there.

353
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:22,411
Right?

354
00:24:24,513 --> 00:24:24,754
There's...

355
00:24:26,803 --> 00:24:32,066
A couple easy challenges, tricks that can help you

356
00:24:32,326 --> 00:24:33,566
brainstorm ideas for these.

357
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:36,387
It doesn't need to be your next game or creation,

358
00:24:36,407 --> 00:24:39,089
but at least something you can brainstorm for one,

359
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:40,509
two hours to practice this,

360
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,450
mixing the mundane with the fantastic.

361
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:46,232
And he's working on a very popular formula,

362
00:24:46,272 --> 00:24:49,853
which is mixing a fantastic thing with a mundane setup.

363
00:24:50,234 --> 00:24:52,175
And the most popular one that we have seen to exhaustion,

364
00:24:55,645 --> 00:25:02,015
sorry, is a school for whatever fantastic. We have Harry Potter and the Magician's School

365
00:25:02,175 --> 00:25:06,502
for Wizards. We have My Hero Academia, School for Superheroes. We have the Daily Class,

366
00:25:06,862 --> 00:25:10,628
School for Assassins, and we can go on. So...

367
00:25:11,457 --> 00:25:21,739
I challenge yourself, spend one hour brainstorming an idea that, for instance, something that changed the something fantastic, a school for, I don't know, let's say for deities.

368
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,540
So you can make it the school is for a specific pantheon, like Greek gods or many pantheons.

369
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:33,521
And every clique in the school is a different pantheon, or maybe a different type of deities like eldritch deities.

370
00:25:33,601 --> 00:25:36,802
And you get a way weirder fiction.

371
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:38,820
Or maybe you can do the opposite.

372
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:42,602
And I challenge you to change the mundane setup.

373
00:25:43,022 --> 00:25:45,643
And you have, for instance, a company

374
00:25:45,683 --> 00:25:47,844
that's like gray, boring offices.

375
00:25:48,144 --> 00:25:50,185
But what they do is create new worlds.

376
00:25:50,746 --> 00:25:55,128
They are like creators of worlds, but in a gray office.

377
00:25:55,748 --> 00:26:00,250
Or you have a law office for superheroes and all the law

378
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:01,391
issues they have.

379
00:26:01,711 --> 00:26:02,932
But it's not about the superheroes.

380
00:26:03,332 --> 00:26:05,013
It's about the lawyers, the fiction.

381
00:26:05,693 --> 00:26:11,198
Or you have a PR agency for gods that are trying to get a bigger following and you follow

382
00:26:11,258 --> 00:26:13,100
the work in the PR agency.

383
00:26:15,122 --> 00:26:15,943
Try to do it.

384
00:26:15,963 --> 00:26:18,024
Try to brainstorm this for one hour or two.

385
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:21,728
So next, let's go into the last part, the true depths.

386
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:21,788
So

387
00:26:22,389 --> 00:26:23,970
Transcribed by https://otter.ai

388
00:26:25,254 --> 00:26:29,316
This is again about building true connection

389
00:26:29,376 --> 00:26:31,617
with your audience, with your fans,

390
00:26:32,097 --> 00:26:36,019
on values, on emotions, on identity.

391
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:38,520
And we have found two ways,

392
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,261
two things that you can care of around this,

393
00:26:41,301 --> 00:26:44,102
which is voices and values and ship dynamics.

394
00:26:45,923 --> 00:26:49,504
And I'm guessing that in the chat,

395
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:52,165
people will be asking for ship dynamics maybe,

396
00:26:52,226 --> 00:26:53,466
but it's the other one, it's voice and values.

397
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:54,566
That's where we're checking today.

398
00:26:56,662 --> 00:26:58,963
So, for devices, it's very simple.

399
00:26:59,004 --> 00:27:00,845
It's about you need to flesh your characters out.

400
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:04,107
This is so obvious, and yet I fail to see it

401
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:05,608
in many fictions I consume,

402
00:27:05,628 --> 00:27:08,190
like really fleshing the characters out

403
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,231
and following all the steps

404
00:27:10,811 --> 00:27:13,033
to make them feel real as a main goal.

405
00:27:13,373 --> 00:27:15,454
We will check some of the steps we follow in Morse code.

406
00:27:15,474 --> 00:27:17,656
Some are tied to insights we haven't seen today,

407
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:19,157
but they're pretty self-explanatory.

408
00:27:20,197 --> 00:27:21,899
For instance, tropes.

409
00:27:22,339 --> 00:27:22,519
Like.

410
00:27:24,257 --> 00:27:29,442
We identified and chose recognizable tropes for our characters, monster types, which are

411
00:27:29,462 --> 00:27:34,126
tropes on themselves, school tropes, and don't try to reinvent the wheel.

412
00:27:34,246 --> 00:27:40,733
Of course you will disrupt these tropes a bit, but you also want to keep stuff so these

413
00:27:40,793 --> 00:27:42,054
are the pillars for your characters.

414
00:27:42,775 --> 00:27:48,259
You want to find themes like semantic territories that you will use for the characters narratives.

415
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:54,424
You want to build some depth. You want to spend some time asking the right questions. What's the

416
00:27:54,824 --> 00:28:00,829
upbringing of the characters? Who are their family? What's their backstories? Why they are the way

417
00:28:00,869 --> 00:28:07,694
they are? Let's not just make them one way, but let's try to understand how they come to be that

418
00:28:07,774 --> 00:28:07,915
way.

419
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:12,637
And details, this seems more like non-important,

420
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:16,785
but it is because we are built not only

421
00:28:17,045 --> 00:28:19,810
in our big, deep stories, but also in our little details.

422
00:28:21,514 --> 00:28:25,318
And this builds a rapport with the audience

423
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:27,581
and also gives the characters a lot of texture,

424
00:28:27,621 --> 00:28:28,622
which is super good.

425
00:28:29,103 --> 00:28:31,125
So think of little details.

426
00:28:31,145 --> 00:28:33,008
Spend some time, and I sometimes fail

427
00:28:33,028 --> 00:28:35,311
to see this in characters on popular fictions.

428
00:28:35,651 --> 00:28:38,935
Spend some time creating details that

429
00:28:39,015 --> 00:28:40,397
give texture to the characters.

430
00:28:40,817 --> 00:28:44,741
And finally, values, which is very important too, because we all have values.

431
00:28:44,821 --> 00:28:47,504
And if your characters need to feel real, they should have to.

432
00:28:47,925 --> 00:28:54,371
Like the specific ways in which they understand the world that surrounds them, right?

433
00:28:56,753 --> 00:29:03,821
And the main goal, I think, is to get a variety of voices.

434
00:29:05,048 --> 00:29:07,629
that feel real and unique and different,

435
00:29:08,429 --> 00:29:11,390
that help people to project and to identify with.

436
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:14,351
And I want to speak for a minute on the idea

437
00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:16,812
of telling this variety of,

438
00:29:17,072 --> 00:29:18,533
so showing this variety of voices

439
00:29:18,573 --> 00:29:20,673
and telling these diverse stories.

440
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:28,976
And sometimes people worry because they think that telling diverse stories is a bit too specific and it can be niche.

441
00:29:28,996 --> 00:29:30,076
And I don't think so.

442
00:29:30,536 --> 00:29:34,177
Because, yes, of course, some of these stories may feel niche.

443
00:29:34,217 --> 00:29:36,058
But there's two things to keep in mind.

444
00:29:36,838 --> 00:29:41,979
For once, no matter how niche or specific a story is, I think there's still dashes of the universal.

445
00:29:42,219 --> 00:29:48,320
In many specific stories, there's values and situations and experiences we can all understand and relate to.

446
00:29:49,742 --> 00:29:54,847
the finding our own truth or getting our voice heard.

447
00:29:55,247 --> 00:29:58,990
And so you can build specific stories looking into the,

448
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:02,693
also into the universal details that can help other people

449
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:03,794
to relate with those stories.

450
00:30:04,114 --> 00:30:06,516
And also, of course, there will be still parts

451
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:08,938
of the specific experience of a character

452
00:30:09,018 --> 00:30:12,421
that maybe people can relate to that easily,

453
00:30:12,782 --> 00:30:14,043
but there's no issue with that.

454
00:30:14,283 --> 00:30:17,105
I think there's a richness in listening to stories

455
00:30:17,145 --> 00:30:19,667
that are far from ours and learning from experiences

456
00:30:19,707 --> 00:30:21,028
that diverge from ours.

457
00:30:21,648 --> 00:30:24,490
And there's risk to that, I don't think so.

458
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,752
If we can connect with the story of a space pirate

459
00:30:26,772 --> 00:30:27,992
and I can assure you,

460
00:30:28,313 --> 00:30:30,454
my experience is far from being a space pirate,

461
00:30:30,974 --> 00:30:33,156
I can probably connect with other many stories.

462
00:30:33,336 --> 00:30:36,819
So be calm, don't worry.

463
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:39,540
I think there's no risk in telling these diverse stories.

464
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:40,001
So.

465
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:47,950
Here we are again. Now, to sum up, it's cakes, bites, binges, and early in between.

466
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:53,213
This is a different metaphor, the idea of doing like focus on the first splash,

467
00:30:53,953 --> 00:31:00,056
ways to draw attention powerfully, focus on the dive and the ways to invite people deeper,

468
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:04,638
focus on the true death, on how to connect on deeper levels of emotions, values, and identity.

469
00:31:05,638 --> 00:31:09,120
We have seen some examples. And that leads us to the conclusions.

470
00:31:10,115 --> 00:31:13,576
And I would love to tell you that I found a super cool,

471
00:31:13,696 --> 00:31:17,338
conclusive sentence, all those cool talks that say something

472
00:31:17,398 --> 00:31:22,000
and you say, whoa, that's super, like, a big truth.

473
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,281
But I didn't find anything like that.

474
00:31:24,321 --> 00:31:26,902
And I'm sorry, and I hope you can excuse me.

475
00:31:27,422 --> 00:31:30,223
And I said, even if it's not so cool and short,

476
00:31:30,643 --> 00:31:32,484
that the main idea here is that you

477
00:31:32,504 --> 00:31:35,265
need to understand there's value in having not just

478
00:31:35,305 --> 00:31:36,226
an audience, but a fandom.

479
00:31:37,147 --> 00:31:40,373
So build your creations with the concept of fan consumption in mind,

480
00:31:40,954 --> 00:31:43,639
making them multi-layer and caring for every layer in it.

481
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:48,247
Draw people's attention, hook them deeper, and keep them in love.
