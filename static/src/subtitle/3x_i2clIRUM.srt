1
00:00:08,371 --> 00:00:10,713
All right, so I'm Jennifer Brandes-Hepler,

2
00:00:11,034 --> 00:00:13,456
and I wanted to talk about exposition here

3
00:00:13,556 --> 00:00:17,360
because, show of hands, how many of you woke up today thinking,

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,422
oh boy, I want to write a giant block of exposition

5
00:00:20,743 --> 00:00:22,945
that players are going to button through and forget almost

6
00:00:23,005 --> 00:00:23,585
immediately?

7
00:00:23,605 --> 00:00:27,689
All right, and how many of you have had to spend a work day

8
00:00:27,749 --> 00:00:29,091
or two doing exactly that?

9
00:00:30,582 --> 00:00:31,623
That's kind of what I thought.

10
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:34,808
So now I'm going to stand here for 25 minutes

11
00:00:34,888 --> 00:00:36,611
and lecture you on why you should never

12
00:00:36,651 --> 00:00:39,094
have someone stand there for 25 minutes and lecture you.

13
00:00:41,077 --> 00:00:43,619
So let me start with a little bit of who I am.

14
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:46,962
I've been working in games since the late 90s.

15
00:00:47,162 --> 00:00:49,164
I started as a freelancer for a bunch

16
00:00:49,264 --> 00:00:52,187
of different tabletop role-playing games

17
00:00:52,247 --> 00:00:53,709
like Shadowrun and Paranoia.

18
00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:57,512
And then after that, I went out to Hollywood for a few years.

19
00:00:57,672 --> 00:01:02,017
And I was on a television show called The Agency on CBS.

20
00:01:02,477 --> 00:01:03,018
I wasn't on it.

21
00:01:03,098 --> 00:01:03,638
I wrote for it.

22
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:13,474
And after that I was recruited by Bioware and I spent eight years there as a senior writer on all three Dragon Age titles and Star Wars The Old Republic.

23
00:01:15,132 --> 00:01:18,735
And when I left Bioware, I spent two years as the lead writer

24
00:01:19,575 --> 00:01:21,937
on Game of Thrones Ascent for Disruptor Beam.

25
00:01:22,818 --> 00:01:26,741
And I'm also a co-author of the Game Narrative Toolbox, which

26
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:29,283
is a game writing textbook from Focal Press.

27
00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:31,985
And I just got the all clear to announce my new book

28
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:35,308
from Focal Press, which is Women in Game Development,

29
00:01:35,408 --> 00:01:38,070
Breaking the Glass Level Cap, which will be out this fall.

30
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:38,911
Woo!

31
00:01:40,853 --> 00:01:40,913
Woo!

32
00:01:44,657 --> 00:01:45,137
Thank you.

33
00:01:46,738 --> 00:01:50,322
And just this January, I made a very big change in my career

34
00:01:50,582 --> 00:01:54,305
and took a sort of sideways step into serious games, which

35
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:56,627
is something I've been interested in for a long time.

36
00:01:57,328 --> 00:02:00,611
So I'm now working for a company called Cognito Interactive,

37
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:05,215
which uses game-style interactive dialogues to teach

38
00:02:05,335 --> 00:02:08,278
doctors and teachers and parents how to have.

39
00:02:08,858 --> 00:02:14,026
better and more empathetic communication skills with their patients and students and children.

40
00:02:14,687 --> 00:02:18,652
So basically I finally found a way to make money off of all the time that I spend

41
00:02:18,712 --> 00:02:21,616
talking to my kids about their feelings and being mad at my doctors.

42
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:27,867
So to me, exposition is information

43
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:30,008
that you want to get across to players,

44
00:02:30,148 --> 00:02:31,469
and you want them to remember.

45
00:02:31,929 --> 00:02:34,410
And it has to be delivered in dialogue.

46
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,831
So let's start by talking about why we actually

47
00:02:37,911 --> 00:02:39,431
have dialogue in games.

48
00:02:39,711 --> 00:02:41,532
If you saw my talk here two years ago,

49
00:02:41,592 --> 00:02:42,972
you've heard me say this before.

50
00:02:43,513 --> 00:02:47,034
The purpose of game dialogue is to move the player forward.

51
00:02:48,173 --> 00:02:51,876
So why does so much game dialogue end up like this?

52
00:02:52,476 --> 00:02:54,678
Let me tell you about my people.

53
00:02:54,698 --> 00:02:58,540
Our histories begin in the age of stone

54
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,523
and end up with the player kind of like that.

55
00:03:03,378 --> 00:03:06,441
Well, a lot of times it's because the dialogue starts out like this.

56
00:03:06,842 --> 00:03:10,886
And then after a marketing meeting, it turns into something like that.

57
00:03:11,706 --> 00:03:16,411
And then when the lead designer needs to show off the deep, explorable world, you have to

58
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:17,092
add this.

59
00:03:17,872 --> 00:03:22,477
And then when QA realizes a week before cert that the whole area is empty and the level

60
00:03:22,497 --> 00:03:25,400
designers need to throw in some mobs, you also have to work this in.

61
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:30,779
So does that mean we should get rid of exposition entirely?

62
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,081
Are all the execs actually right when they keep

63
00:03:33,181 --> 00:03:34,702
asking us to cut, cut, cut?

64
00:03:35,222 --> 00:03:37,004
Can we just forget what we're saying

65
00:03:37,064 --> 00:03:38,325
and charge into game play?

66
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:40,267
No.

67
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,269
Exposition is necessary.

68
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:44,951
It's how players know what's happening, where to go,

69
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:46,052
and what to do next.

70
00:03:46,552 --> 00:03:47,593
It's an important tool.

71
00:03:47,713 --> 00:03:49,315
It just has to be used correctly.

72
00:03:50,655 --> 00:03:51,915
So how do we do it better?

73
00:03:53,476 --> 00:03:55,317
One of the key tasks that we have

74
00:03:55,477 --> 00:03:57,377
as game writers and narrative designers

75
00:03:57,617 --> 00:04:00,759
is to ask the question of when we

76
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,119
need to use exposition in dialogue

77
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,761
and figure out the difference between when we must use

78
00:04:05,841 --> 00:04:08,522
exposition in dialogue, such as when there's

79
00:04:08,602 --> 00:04:10,983
plot-critical information that the player needs

80
00:04:11,063 --> 00:04:12,523
to complete a quest or mission.

81
00:04:13,604 --> 00:04:17,149
when we probably should use exposition in dialogue,

82
00:04:17,229 --> 00:04:20,074
such as when the player needs an in-character motivation

83
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,256
to carry out a mission.

84
00:04:22,407 --> 00:04:25,328
When we can use exposition and dialogue,

85
00:04:25,408 --> 00:04:28,609
such as when there's information that the player can optionally

86
00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:31,550
ask for or that can be delivered without affecting

87
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,630
the flow of gameplay.

88
00:04:33,651 --> 00:04:37,032
And when we really shouldn't put our exposition in dialogue,

89
00:04:37,132 --> 00:04:39,192
which is when there's information that

90
00:04:39,332 --> 00:04:41,933
stops your gameplay, that isn't relevant to the current

91
00:04:41,973 --> 00:04:44,574
mission, and the player didn't actually ask for.

92
00:04:46,755 --> 00:04:48,896
But I see some of you writhing in your seats.

93
00:04:49,036 --> 00:04:50,457
I have all this lore.

94
00:04:50,477 --> 00:04:53,179
I've been working on this world Bible,

95
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:56,602
and it's like 5,000 pages long, and it's got the full history.

96
00:04:56,642 --> 00:04:58,103
And what am I supposed to do with it?

97
00:04:58,943 --> 00:05:01,685
Well, world lore is great for a lot of things

98
00:05:01,725 --> 00:05:03,206
that are not dialogue.

99
00:05:03,486 --> 00:05:05,568
World lore is fantastic for using

100
00:05:05,628 --> 00:05:07,089
in in-game books and journals.

101
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,552
It's great for ambient dialogue that the player can overhear

102
00:05:11,672 --> 00:05:12,973
and not have to interact with.

103
00:05:13,794 --> 00:05:18,418
If you're in a game that has optional question hubs,

104
00:05:18,498 --> 00:05:20,459
World Lore is great for filling those out.

105
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,182
World Lore is very important when

106
00:05:23,202 --> 00:05:25,764
you're doing a game that uses environmental storytelling,

107
00:05:25,904 --> 00:05:28,667
using visuals and audio that the player doesn't directly

108
00:05:28,707 --> 00:05:29,467
interact with.

109
00:05:30,548 --> 00:05:32,670
World Lore is essential when you're

110
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,614
doing an auxiliary product like a novel or a webcomic.

111
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:41,181
And if you're in a game that has a lot of world lore

112
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:42,883
and your players are into that sort of thing,

113
00:05:43,023 --> 00:05:45,086
it can even be worthwhile to do a codex where

114
00:05:45,106 --> 00:05:45,806
they can look it up.

115
00:05:46,968 --> 00:05:48,449
So if we're not going to be talking

116
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,432
about exposition about world lore,

117
00:05:50,832 --> 00:05:52,654
what are we generally talking about here?

118
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,220
Usually we're talking about plot.

119
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:58,062
And a lot of times, game plots, especially if you're

120
00:05:58,102 --> 00:06:00,463
on something like a big RPG like I've been on,

121
00:06:01,043 --> 00:06:02,884
you get these labyrinthine things

122
00:06:02,924 --> 00:06:05,565
that are sort of like this crossed with some of that

123
00:06:05,605 --> 00:06:07,706
and maybe a little of this thrown in for good measure.

124
00:06:08,747 --> 00:06:11,988
So how do you get all of that across to players

125
00:06:12,128 --> 00:06:14,670
in a way where they're going to have any idea what's going on?

126
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:19,132
You need to figure out what your key pieces of information

127
00:06:19,352 --> 00:06:22,113
are and present them in bite-sized pieces.

128
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:25,456
For example, let's take a plot where

129
00:06:25,776 --> 00:06:28,119
we find out that there is an ancient crown that's

130
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:28,900
gone missing.

131
00:06:29,841 --> 00:06:32,724
And we learn that the crown is imbued with elven magic.

132
00:06:32,764 --> 00:06:36,008
And we find out that the elven kingdom used to lie to the West

133
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:38,210
and that the kingdom was destroyed

134
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,452
in the war with the goblins.

135
00:06:40,413 --> 00:06:44,615
In most games, each of these points should probably be its own dialogue.

136
00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:48,076
You can assume that players will only really remember one thing,

137
00:06:48,196 --> 00:06:51,038
usually the last thing in any dialogue.

138
00:06:51,158 --> 00:06:55,820
So by splitting up your important information into different conversations,

139
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,381
you really increase the chances that players are going to remember anything.

140
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:04,311
And of course, when we split up our information

141
00:07:04,451 --> 00:07:07,275
into little crumbs and we trickle it along

142
00:07:07,315 --> 00:07:09,979
for players to follow, we call that a breadcrumb trail.

143
00:07:11,287 --> 00:07:14,228
So, are there any best practices for breadcrumb trails?

144
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:17,590
What I've found is that it's really important for players

145
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,671
to know what they're looking for first,

146
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:23,433
and only then get the details of why and how to use it.

147
00:07:24,273 --> 00:07:26,354
So to go back to our crown example,

148
00:07:26,974 --> 00:07:28,155
you could do something in a game

149
00:07:28,195 --> 00:07:29,836
where maybe you would start with

150
00:07:30,396 --> 00:07:32,577
a scrap of ancient prophecy that says

151
00:07:32,637 --> 00:07:34,478
that only the magic of the elven crown

152
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:35,939
can defeat the goblin king,

153
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:36,959
and you know from the map

154
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:38,580
that there are elven ruins in the west.

155
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,864
So you go there and you find the runes that tell the story of the first battle between the elves and goblins,

156
00:07:45,305 --> 00:07:46,966
but you can't translate the runes yet.

157
00:07:47,727 --> 00:07:51,069
Then on the way out, you meet a scholar who can translate the runes,

158
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:56,673
and he tells you where the escape route was that the elven royalty escaped down when the kingdom fell.

159
00:07:57,474 --> 00:08:02,637
And only once you follow the escape route do you actually find the crown and the information of how to use it.

160
00:08:03,597 --> 00:08:10,163
By presenting the information in this order, what, why, where, and how, you make sure that

161
00:08:10,243 --> 00:08:16,408
players have a goal in mind, that is the what, that is motivating them to listen when you

162
00:08:16,468 --> 00:08:18,630
tell them all that back story, which is the why.

163
00:08:19,951 --> 00:08:25,834
And then you present the piece of information that is going to let them go to the next plot point. That's the where.

164
00:08:26,754 --> 00:08:33,178
And only then do you tell them how this one quest is going to fit into the larger storyline. That's the how.

165
00:08:33,938 --> 00:08:36,200
So what this all sort of boils down to is that

166
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:41,362
exposition should be the solution to a problem that players are trying to solve already.

167
00:08:42,163 --> 00:08:46,575
If players are already trying to solve something and you give them exposition that helps them,

168
00:08:47,156 --> 00:08:49,963
they're going to want to listen to it and try to remember it.

169
00:08:52,254 --> 00:08:55,436
So what pitfalls can we run into when we're trying

170
00:08:55,476 --> 00:08:56,737
to use breadcrumb trails?

171
00:08:57,597 --> 00:08:59,319
The first one that I've seen happen a lot

172
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:02,901
is what I call the maybe the elves know something problem.

173
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:06,723
And we did this a lot on Dragon Age Inquisition,

174
00:09:06,903 --> 00:09:10,005
where we had a big document that we were working from.

175
00:09:10,445 --> 00:09:12,647
And then the player figures out that maybe the elves know

176
00:09:12,707 --> 00:09:13,067
something.

177
00:09:13,547 --> 00:09:17,009
And our writers would go off into a room and they would dutifully write, you know, your

178
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:19,271
followers saying, maybe the elves know something.

179
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:23,553
And then we would all play test it and we would, you know, follow the followers who

180
00:09:23,573 --> 00:09:25,254
were saying maybe the elves know something.

181
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:30,157
And we would end up basically wandering around waiting for the next plot delivering NPC to

182
00:09:30,217 --> 00:09:30,717
find us.

183
00:09:31,518 --> 00:09:32,879
And it all felt a little like this.

184
00:09:34,195 --> 00:09:37,957
And we found that you could actually correct this really,

185
00:09:38,017 --> 00:09:41,958
really easily by just giving the player something

186
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,138
that they were looking for.

187
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:46,039
Go to the Elven ruins and get the widget of what's-it-ness.

188
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,201
And then you could keep all of the rest of what you already

189
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:53,942
had of the next plot delivering NPC finding you.

190
00:09:54,462 --> 00:09:58,644
And instead of feeling like the designers were manipulating you,

191
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:00,724
it felt like, hey, this is my reward

192
00:10:00,784 --> 00:10:03,505
for my hard work of looking for the widget of what's-it-ness.

193
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:10,123
So that was a really easy fix for what had seemed to be a really intractable problem.

194
00:10:12,252 --> 00:10:16,352
The next big pitfall that you see, especially with beginning writers, is the

195
00:10:16,793 --> 00:10:20,813
let me tell you a story mentality where people figure that

196
00:10:21,393 --> 00:10:25,694
the player's going to want to know everything about this crown before they go looking for it.

197
00:10:26,274 --> 00:10:29,575
And the problem with doing that is if the player doesn't know why that

198
00:10:29,635 --> 00:10:33,676
information is relevant to them, they literally don't know which mental

199
00:10:33,736 --> 00:10:37,877
filing cabinet to file it under and so instead it just gets left on the floor

200
00:10:38,077 --> 00:10:39,917
and they don't remember anything about it.

201
00:10:41,485 --> 00:10:49,973
By following the what, why, where, how order that I had in the previous slide,

202
00:10:50,593 --> 00:10:54,957
you can avoid that problem because by the time players get the story,

203
00:10:55,058 --> 00:10:57,079
they know exactly what it's relevant to,

204
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,782
and therefore it's a lot more likely that they're going to remember it.

205
00:11:01,853 --> 00:11:06,076
And the last pitfall that I've found is red herrings.

206
00:11:06,616 --> 00:11:10,119
I discovered a long time ago as a tabletop GM,

207
00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:12,720
do not put red herrings in your games

208
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,742
unless you want players to swim after them off a cliff.

209
00:11:17,424 --> 00:11:23,548
As a general rule, if players go to the trouble of remembering a piece of exposition that you tell them in a game,

210
00:11:24,249 --> 00:11:28,552
they expect it to be important, and if it turns out it's not important, they don't go,

211
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:31,514
oh, darn, I was an idiot for following that red herring.

212
00:11:31,554 --> 00:11:33,736
They go, your game is broken and it sucks.

213
00:11:35,257 --> 00:11:38,179
So unless you're willing to deal with that consequence,

214
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:42,683
there's usually not any compelling reason to include red herrings in interactive games.

215
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:50,111
So let's go back to the beginning, the most basic piece of advice that you get in every

216
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:54,654
English class and screenwriting seminar and writing book on the market of show, don't

217
00:11:54,694 --> 00:11:55,014
tell.

218
00:11:55,855 --> 00:12:00,257
What does that mean for games, especially games where all the information is being delivered

219
00:12:00,297 --> 00:12:01,017
in dialogue?

220
00:12:01,118 --> 00:12:02,598
Isn't everything being told?

221
00:12:03,584 --> 00:12:05,425
Well, I like to think of exposition

222
00:12:05,705 --> 00:12:08,586
as the bitter pill you're trying to get players to swallow,

223
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:12,287
while characterization is the delicious chocolate coating

224
00:12:12,327 --> 00:12:13,608
that makes it go down easy.

225
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:16,349
So most of the rest of this talk is

226
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:18,030
going to focus on characterization,

227
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,691
because if you make sure that the characters who

228
00:12:20,731 --> 00:12:23,332
deliver your exposition are interesting in and of

229
00:12:23,372 --> 00:12:26,153
themselves, then you can make that exposition go

230
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:28,013
from this to this.

231
00:12:31,994 --> 00:12:35,315
So the best exposition is characterization.

232
00:12:35,556 --> 00:12:37,356
When somebody is telling you something

233
00:12:37,436 --> 00:12:39,137
about a plot in your game, you want

234
00:12:39,157 --> 00:12:42,118
to know not just what happened, but how it affected them.

235
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:45,640
So if we consider the news in a Star Wars game

236
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,381
that the Empire has landed on a Republic outpost,

237
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:54,173
If we get told this by a Republic commander, this information will probably come across

238
00:12:54,313 --> 00:12:55,233
briefing style.

239
00:12:55,714 --> 00:12:59,675
Maybe she'll give you some of the political or martial significance of the outpost.

240
00:13:00,055 --> 00:13:02,977
Maybe she'll be concerned about looking good to her superior.

241
00:13:03,797 --> 00:13:08,219
But if it's told by the outpost's terrified janitor who's hiding in a closet, then you

242
00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:09,459
might get the human cost.

243
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,761
Maybe he has a family and the Republic won't let them evacuate the planet and surrender

244
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:14,462
to the Empire.

245
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:22,167
If you tell it from the point of view of a defecting imperial, you'll get a whole third point of view on that.

246
00:13:22,227 --> 00:13:26,251
You'll get something about how much better the quality of life is on the outpost,

247
00:13:26,351 --> 00:13:29,614
and how you have to drive off the empire or she'll be executed.

248
00:13:30,455 --> 00:13:36,218
You get the same information, that the Empire has landed on the planet, but it's three very different dialogues.

249
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:42,342
And if all three of these characters are in one story, you can end up with a more complex picture of what's happening,

250
00:13:42,742 --> 00:13:46,584
but because they're such different perspectives, it's not a giant exposition bomb.

251
00:13:48,645 --> 00:13:55,489
So, when you're writing exposition-delivering NPCs, there are two major things that you need to keep in mind.

252
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:57,209
Their speaking style.

253
00:13:58,219 --> 00:13:59,680
and their stake in the story.

254
00:14:00,281 --> 00:14:02,002
So let's break these down a little bit.

255
00:14:03,604 --> 00:14:05,646
For speaking style, you want to determine

256
00:14:05,866 --> 00:14:09,509
all of the basic things, like sentence length and vocabulary

257
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:10,730
and slang usage.

258
00:14:11,211 --> 00:14:14,173
It's the difference between, oy, me hut is afire, me lord,

259
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:15,094
can ye help me?

260
00:14:15,234 --> 00:14:17,817
And brave adventurer, this land is

261
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,919
seeing troubles the likes of which we have rarely seen.

262
00:14:20,939 --> 00:14:23,161
And now you know why I'm not a voice actor.

263
00:14:25,183 --> 00:14:32,507
So, both of these can equally introduce a quest in a fantasy game about saving a village

264
00:14:32,547 --> 00:14:37,690
from bandits, but they are very different experiences of what mindset you're in when

265
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,830
you start that quest.

266
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:44,673
But even more importantly than the speaking style is what extraneous information do they

267
00:14:44,873 --> 00:14:46,774
wrap the important information in.

268
00:14:47,575 --> 00:14:51,860
If there isn't any extraneous information, if they're literally not telling you anything

269
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:56,004
other than that bandits are attacking this village, then they can be replaced with a

270
00:14:56,065 --> 00:14:58,768
sign nailed to a tree that says, bandits this way.

271
00:14:59,548 --> 00:15:03,773
And if your character can be replaced with a sign nailed to a tree, you've done something

272
00:15:03,813 --> 00:15:04,033
wrong.

273
00:15:04,954 --> 00:15:08,137
So you want to be considering what else they're

274
00:15:08,197 --> 00:15:10,899
saying about the situation at the same time

275
00:15:10,979 --> 00:15:13,341
as they're giving you the plot critical information.

276
00:15:13,841 --> 00:15:18,165
It's the difference between that guy who is talking about justice

277
00:15:18,365 --> 00:15:21,347
and how it's not fair that the lords are safe

278
00:15:21,407 --> 00:15:24,149
and his people are the ones who are left to starve and die,

279
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,572
and the other guy who's mostly just concerned about whether it's

280
00:15:27,592 --> 00:15:28,893
going to look bad to the neighbors

281
00:15:28,953 --> 00:15:30,755
if he lets his people get killed by bandits.

282
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:38,213
So just to delve into the more academic for a second here,

283
00:15:39,615 --> 00:15:43,098
generally the more information that you can convey through subtext,

284
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:45,761
the less expository your writing is going to feel.

285
00:15:46,422 --> 00:15:49,585
Subtext is the art of not saying exactly what you mean.

286
00:15:49,845 --> 00:15:52,508
It's the difference between this and this.

287
00:15:57,372 --> 00:16:01,778
Any information that's part of the background of a world or plot or character

288
00:16:01,938 --> 00:16:06,385
or has to do with how a character is feeling should generally go in subtext.

289
00:16:06,645 --> 00:16:12,653
Only information that the player has to immediately act on should be in broad, simple text.

290
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:16,574
And if you're doing serious games work, where you actually

291
00:16:16,634 --> 00:16:18,437
need to teach your players something,

292
00:16:19,298 --> 00:16:22,944
and you can't trust them to get what you put in the subtext,

293
00:16:23,004 --> 00:16:26,349
you can consider using analogies to make information memorable.

294
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:29,867
I use this a lot in my work at Cognito.

295
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:35,409
We did a sim to help teach parents how to help their children manage their feelings.

296
00:16:36,049 --> 00:16:40,210
And instead of just saying, teach children words for their feelings, we would say things

297
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:44,571
like, just like you tell your baby, that's your nose, a hundred times before they say

298
00:16:44,651 --> 00:16:48,052
nose, you need to tell them that's your angry and that's your scared.

299
00:16:48,692 --> 00:16:52,713
And by using that kind of analogy, it makes the information much more memorable.

300
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:56,230
So stake in the story.

301
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:59,213
If the person who is telling you the information

302
00:16:59,373 --> 00:17:01,515
has no stake in the story, then they're

303
00:17:01,555 --> 00:17:04,398
probably the wrong person to be giving you this information.

304
00:17:04,498 --> 00:17:06,140
You need to replace them with somebody

305
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,582
who has something more to lose from what they're saying.

306
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,705
Everybody who's talking to you in a game story

307
00:17:11,785 --> 00:17:19,373
should have something they want, need, fear, stand to gain.

308
00:17:20,047 --> 00:17:22,289
or stand to lose from what they're saying.

309
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:25,090
And it's the variety of these stakes

310
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,671
that gives your story texture.

311
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:30,434
If you use too many of the same stake in the story in a row,

312
00:17:30,454 --> 00:17:33,495
it gets old, even if it's something legitimately

313
00:17:33,556 --> 00:17:36,617
interesting, like needing the player to save their life.

314
00:17:38,018 --> 00:17:40,879
You want to have a great variety of stakes in the plot.

315
00:17:40,979 --> 00:17:43,340
Some people should be doing stuff for noble reasons,

316
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,861
some for selfish reasons,

317
00:17:45,381 --> 00:17:47,061
some might be deceiving the player,

318
00:17:47,281 --> 00:17:48,922
some are offering to profit the player,

319
00:17:48,962 --> 00:17:51,043
and others might be asking them to be altruistic.

320
00:17:53,721 --> 00:17:55,043
Um, and emotion.

321
00:17:55,343 --> 00:17:59,229
If characterization is the chocolate coating that we're using to make our

322
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:04,856
exposition taste good, emotion is actually the sugar that lets us taste all the

323
00:18:04,896 --> 00:18:06,118
rest of the work we've put in.

324
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,361
Cause without that, the chocolate tastes kind of like this.

325
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:16,371
So even if you've done the rest right and you have an interesting character with a stake in the story and a cool speaking style,

326
00:18:17,072 --> 00:18:20,575
if they don't feel anything about what they're saying, then neither will the player.

327
00:18:21,595 --> 00:18:26,759
And a lot of times writers get afraid of sentiment. They don't want to be maudlin or melodramatic.

328
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:31,563
And my personal philosophy on this has always been, what the hell.

329
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:36,766
I want my characters to have really big feelings and really care about what they're saying.

330
00:18:37,006 --> 00:18:41,589
If it comes across as melodramatic, it's usually easier to tone down a line or performance

331
00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:44,871
than it is to add emotion to something written blandly.

332
00:18:46,768 --> 00:18:48,910
So all of this generally means that when

333
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,533
you're writing for games, you want to be writing twice.

334
00:18:52,094 --> 00:18:54,317
The first time you go through and you figure out

335
00:18:54,357 --> 00:18:57,660
the information flow of what does the player need to know

336
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,302
to be able to get through this game.

337
00:18:59,923 --> 00:19:01,425
This is the basics of the job.

338
00:19:01,645 --> 00:19:03,147
And if you haven't done this right,

339
00:19:03,187 --> 00:19:04,168
then the game doesn't work.

340
00:19:04,949 --> 00:19:09,793
But then to do the job really well, you want to go through a second time and figure out,

341
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:13,335
in every dialogue, why does the NPC think she's there?

342
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,337
What is this story from her point of view?

343
00:19:16,118 --> 00:19:20,301
And it can't just be that she's there because she wants to tell you about this.

344
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:24,585
She should have a legitimate reason to be there of her own accord.

345
00:19:25,545 --> 00:19:30,108
So one thing to keep in mind when you're doing this second pass is that most people are really

346
00:19:30,188 --> 00:19:34,451
self-centered. They don't tend to care about the fate of the world unless it's their job.

347
00:19:35,152 --> 00:19:39,955
So your plots become more interesting the more you're dealing with people who this is not their

348
00:19:39,995 --> 00:19:46,899
job. So this is why the poor janitor's story is a lot more memorable than the Republic Commander's.

349
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:52,003
The more personal an NPC's motivations, the more memorable they generally are.

350
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:58,163
But one thing to keep in mind is that characterization can also

351
00:19:58,243 --> 00:20:01,945
really be exposition if all that your characterization is

352
00:20:02,086 --> 00:20:04,487
is characters telling you about their background.

353
00:20:05,248 --> 00:20:07,729
So if you look back to the show don't tell maxim,

354
00:20:07,989 --> 00:20:10,691
it can help to realize that exposition

355
00:20:10,771 --> 00:20:12,953
is any kind of telling, even if you're

356
00:20:12,973 --> 00:20:16,335
telling people about character, while characterization

357
00:20:16,395 --> 00:20:19,657
is any kind of showing, even if it's about world or plot.

358
00:20:20,937 --> 00:20:23,618
So just telling players the facts of a character's

359
00:20:23,678 --> 00:20:25,499
backstory of, hi, I'm Bob.

360
00:20:25,539 --> 00:20:26,380
I'm a Jedi Knight.

361
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,321
I entered the Academy at four, and I apprenticed to Master

362
00:20:29,401 --> 00:20:33,064
So-and-So, and fought my first battle at blah, blah, blah.

363
00:20:33,384 --> 00:20:35,305
None of that is really characterization,

364
00:20:35,465 --> 00:20:37,546
even though a lot of writers would think it is.

365
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:41,428
Characterization comes from how characters react,

366
00:20:41,829 --> 00:20:43,430
not from long explanations.

367
00:20:45,163 --> 00:20:47,808
If you have a character with a complex backstory,

368
00:20:48,249 --> 00:20:50,973
you can handle that just like any other exposition.

369
00:20:51,174 --> 00:20:52,556
It can be broken into parts

370
00:20:53,097 --> 00:20:54,961
and then delivered by other characters

371
00:20:55,181 --> 00:20:56,744
who have their own reason to like

372
00:20:56,924 --> 00:20:58,427
or hate the character in question.

373
00:21:00,378 --> 00:21:02,580
For example, let's go back to Star Wars

374
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,662
and say we have a character who was once

375
00:21:04,762 --> 00:21:05,963
tortured by the Empire.

376
00:21:07,405 --> 00:21:09,166
In order to show this to the player,

377
00:21:09,346 --> 00:21:12,610
you could do something like first show him

378
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:15,092
being very anti-Empire, even when

379
00:21:15,152 --> 00:21:16,934
talking to somebody really sympathetic,

380
00:21:16,994 --> 00:21:18,896
like a defector who just saved your life.

381
00:21:19,818 --> 00:21:22,340
Then later, maybe he knows something that he shouldn't,

382
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,482
like the back way into an imperial ship.

383
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:26,984
Then once you're inside the imperial ship,

384
00:21:27,024 --> 00:21:29,086
you meet somebody who recognizes him.

385
00:21:29,146 --> 00:21:30,928
But because you're in the middle of a firefight,

386
00:21:30,968 --> 00:21:32,929
you can't stop and ask about it right now.

387
00:21:34,496 --> 00:21:36,277
This means that by the time you can really

388
00:21:36,557 --> 00:21:39,500
ask about the backstory, a lot of the basics of it

389
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,961
have been established already.

390
00:21:41,862 --> 00:21:44,244
You've already been intrigued about it for a while

391
00:21:44,365 --> 00:21:47,387
so that when the backstory information is given to you,

392
00:21:47,447 --> 00:21:49,289
it feels like the answer to a question

393
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:50,630
you've already been asking.

394
00:21:51,231 --> 00:21:53,453
And you've already seen that it can be useful to you.

395
00:21:53,573 --> 00:21:56,135
Look, he knew this one thing about the Imperial ship.

396
00:21:56,255 --> 00:21:58,057
What else might he know if I get him

397
00:21:58,077 --> 00:22:01,120
to answer the full story of what happened to him?

398
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,982
And the last thing I want to talk about is stereotypes.

399
00:22:08,402 --> 00:22:12,684
When you are designing a character to give exposition,

400
00:22:12,744 --> 00:22:15,085
and you're thinking about their speaking style,

401
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:17,507
and their stake in the story, and what their emotion is,

402
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:18,727
and everything I just said,

403
00:22:19,568 --> 00:22:22,949
don't necessarily go with the first thing that comes to mind,

404
00:22:23,649 --> 00:22:28,211
because sometimes that's this, or this guy, or her,

405
00:22:28,231 --> 00:22:31,893
or this guy, and nobody really wants to see any of them.

406
00:22:32,653 --> 00:22:35,914
So it's always good to try picking

407
00:22:36,034 --> 00:22:39,516
a character and a speaking style or motivation that

408
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:42,377
don't match what your first impression of what

409
00:22:42,417 --> 00:22:43,657
that character would be like.

410
00:22:44,298 --> 00:22:46,338
And then you can figure out how they got that way.

411
00:22:47,108 --> 00:22:51,312
So our story earlier would have been even more interesting if the Republic commander

412
00:22:51,352 --> 00:22:55,536
was at the outpost because her family was there and she was willing to defy orders to

413
00:22:55,596 --> 00:23:00,801
help you save them while the janitor was actually a retired officer or weekend warrior who wanted

414
00:23:00,842 --> 00:23:03,204
to die in the blaze of glory that you've set off.

415
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:07,493
And when you're writing people of different backgrounds

416
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:10,835
than yourself, don't be scared to get it wrong.

417
00:23:11,096 --> 00:23:12,637
It's important to do your research.

418
00:23:13,177 --> 00:23:16,380
But if you write humans, that's more than half the battle.

419
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,262
Any character who is a credible human being

420
00:23:19,462 --> 00:23:22,265
is going to be better than the majority of characters

421
00:23:23,145 --> 00:23:26,588
who are out there in people's own fan fiction

422
00:23:26,908 --> 00:23:29,730
and in an unfortunate amount of published material.

423
00:23:30,311 --> 00:23:30,971
So if.

424
00:23:32,715 --> 00:23:35,258
If your characters have convincing human emotions,

425
00:23:35,678 --> 00:23:38,621
it goes a long way to battling any stereotypes.

426
00:23:40,263 --> 00:23:43,146
So in conclusion, my background is in RPGs,

427
00:23:43,227 --> 00:23:45,449
so some of what I said may apply better there

428
00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:46,610
than to other genres.

429
00:23:46,991 --> 00:23:49,353
But for all games, exposition is best

430
00:23:49,393 --> 00:23:50,975
delivered in small pieces.

431
00:23:52,248 --> 00:23:56,930
Exposition should be the solution to problems that players are already trying to solve.

432
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:01,551
And most of all, you should think about who is delivering your exposition

433
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:03,491
and what they want to get out of saying it.

434
00:24:04,892 --> 00:24:07,892
Pick the person who has the most interesting reason to be there

435
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:09,773
and get into their head.

436
00:24:11,413 --> 00:24:15,034
And if that all goes well, maybe someday some of you will get to write

437
00:24:15,074 --> 00:24:19,695
what we all know is the number one, absolute best way to ever deliver exposition.

438
00:24:20,804 --> 00:24:22,108
a musical number.

439
00:24:24,235 --> 00:24:24,977
So, thank you.

440
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:26,141
I'm Jennifer Hepler.
