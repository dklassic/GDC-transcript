1
00:00:06,218 --> 00:00:11,201
you can get calories and caffeine in a bit. But Nathan Vella, currently president of Cappy,

2
00:00:11,201 --> 00:00:15,543
I believe is his title. Cappy's been around seven, eight years. They've successfully thrown

3
00:00:15,543 --> 00:00:19,405
off the shackles of publisher funding and are now doing more and more of their own stuff,

4
00:00:19,405 --> 00:00:22,767
including the awesome Swords and Sorcery. Who here's played this?

5
00:00:22,767 --> 00:00:27,429
Who here's stuck on Android and wishes they could play it? Yeah.

6
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:32,372
Suckers! Yeah. And with that, Nathan will take it away.

7
00:00:32,372 --> 00:00:34,573
Nathan Vella, everybody.

8
00:00:41,302 --> 00:00:44,903
All righty. We'll just switch over the...

9
00:00:44,903 --> 00:00:46,364
Hit two? OK.

10
00:00:46,364 --> 00:00:50,786
I'm hit... No, not two. One.

11
00:00:50,786 --> 00:00:53,587
Go! All right, we got a dancing naked bear. That's perfect.

12
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:58,890
All righty. So if you want, you can just take a peek at that for a little bit.

13
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,431
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

14
00:01:00,431 --> 00:01:03,352
Okey-doke. So, a very quick introduction,

15
00:01:03,352 --> 00:01:06,694
because introductions are not interesting.

16
00:01:06,694 --> 00:01:10,455
I'm Nathan Vela. I'm the co-founder and president of Cappy.

17
00:01:10,963 --> 00:01:12,604
you can follow me on the Twitters.

18
00:01:12,604 --> 00:01:21,670
So much in the way of Superbrothers Sword and Sorcery EP, I have a nice and long title

19
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:22,531
for this talk.

20
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:27,834
It's called, Perhaps a Time of Miracles Was at Hand, the Business and Development of Superbrothers

21
00:01:27,834 --> 00:01:31,676
Sword and Sorcery EP with Songs and Sounds by Jim Guthrie.

22
00:01:32,543 --> 00:01:34,544
Really, though, it's like a super long-winded way for

23
00:01:34,544 --> 00:01:36,884
me to say that I'm gonna discuss what I

24
00:01:36,884 --> 00:01:38,985
think were some of the most useful learnings on

25
00:01:38,985 --> 00:01:42,985
the business and development side of the game.

26
00:01:42,985 --> 00:01:45,786
So this talk is kinda iOS focused, obviously. How

27
00:01:45,786 --> 00:01:50,107
many people here have made, are making, planning to

28
00:01:50,107 --> 00:01:52,467
make, or eventually think they will make an iOS

29
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:54,888
game? All right. So this is relevant. I feel

30
00:01:54,888 --> 00:01:58,168
much better about myself now. Thank you for not

31
00:01:58,168 --> 00:02:01,349
going to the iOS talks and instead being here.

32
00:02:02,928 --> 00:02:06,810
So, Super Brothers Sword and Sorcery had a whole bunch of people involved.

33
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,832
Super Brothers is Craig, Craig's over there.

34
00:02:09,832 --> 00:02:11,873
Capia's creative director, Chris, played a huge role.

35
00:02:11,873 --> 00:02:13,234
Chris is around here somewhere.

36
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:16,336
There was a couple of programmers, John Marr and Frankie Leung.

37
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,878
We had some QA people that helped out a little bit.

38
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:21,299
My role was a little bit different.

39
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:24,241
I actually didn't really ever touch the game.

40
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:27,023
I didn't really make the game.

41
00:02:27,023 --> 00:02:32,546
Instead, I focused my efforts on ensuring the project was a development and business success.

42
00:02:33,246 --> 00:02:37,808
And while, you know, using the word miracle is a little bit of an exaggeration,

43
00:02:37,808 --> 00:02:41,230
it was still kind of a miraculous event for everyone involved.

44
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:46,433
So, this is my favorite slide of the talk.

45
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:49,115
It's where I brag a whole lot.

46
00:02:49,115 --> 00:02:54,337
So, but it's actually really important because I want to qualify

47
00:02:54,337 --> 00:02:56,258
why I think that this game was a success.

48
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:59,647
And I think it's kind of an important thing to recognize

49
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:01,948
because there's different components of the success,

50
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:04,408
and they all kind of feed into the business and development.

51
00:03:04,408 --> 00:03:05,749
So first of all, it sold over 350,000 copies

52
00:03:05,749 --> 00:03:10,510
in the just under a year that it's been available.

53
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,550
That's crazy.

54
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,290
It's been rated a ton,

55
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:18,211
and most of those are five-star reviews,

56
00:03:18,211 --> 00:03:20,852
which is super awesome.

57
00:03:20,852 --> 00:03:22,712
Sorcery got a ton of critical praise.

58
00:03:23,065 --> 00:03:28,789
That made us feel really good about ourselves, Metacritic lists, all kinds of fun awards.

59
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:33,851
And one of the more interesting things is not only did the mainstream kind of gaming

60
00:03:33,851 --> 00:03:37,794
press cover it, but the non-gaming press and the more typical mainstream press covered

61
00:03:37,794 --> 00:03:38,274
it as well.

62
00:03:38,274 --> 00:03:43,197
The London Times, the New York Times, Mashable, Fast Company, a whole bunch of music blogs,

63
00:03:43,197 --> 00:03:49,340
even a ton of art sites, covered sorcery seriously, not just as a video game, but as a piece of

64
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:49,640
culture.

65
00:03:50,753 --> 00:03:55,916
And lastly, Sorcery has been cited many times in the important discussions surrounding

66
00:03:55,916 --> 00:04:02,400
games as a medium, the massive and insane games as art debate, and also the amazing

67
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,982
disposability of iOS games debate.

68
00:04:04,982 --> 00:04:09,004
So does anybody want me to give this slide again?

69
00:04:09,004 --> 00:04:11,325
I really like this slide a lot.

70
00:04:11,325 --> 00:04:17,329
So the big question here is how did we turn a woefully risky project into a big success?

71
00:04:17,767 --> 00:04:23,071
What were the key points and how did we leverage those key points?

72
00:04:23,071 --> 00:04:25,173
Now let me go back into qualifying stuff.

73
00:04:25,173 --> 00:04:27,955
Why do I think this was a woefully risky project?

74
00:04:27,955 --> 00:04:30,297
It's not an arcade game.

75
00:04:30,297 --> 00:04:32,198
It's not twitchy.

76
00:04:32,198 --> 00:04:33,760
It's not snappy.

77
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,343
It's not the style of game you typically see in the top 10 or top 20 or top 100 of the App Store charts.

78
00:04:38,343 --> 00:04:41,366
Some people might.

79
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:46,754
play it on the toilet, but very few people, I think, played it significant periods of

80
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:52,579
time on the toilet, unlike a lot of iOS games. It's relatively long form. It's not built

81
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:56,742
for microplay sessions. While you could, you could sit down and play it for one screen

82
00:04:56,742 --> 00:05:00,545
at a time. That's not the way the experience was meant to be had, and I don't think that

83
00:05:00,545 --> 00:05:02,727
that's the way the game entices you to experience it.

84
00:05:02,727 --> 00:05:09,513
From the development perspective, it was a really long iOS project. I mean, I think a

85
00:05:09,513 --> 00:05:11,214
lot of people have heard a lot of talk about.

86
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:17,020
iOS games being developed in one month or two months or, you know, if you're Zach Gage,

87
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:25,803
like six hours. So for us to go over 1.5 years was extremely risky and also very rare. It

88
00:05:25,803 --> 00:05:32,025
had a very, very large comparative to a lot of iOS games budget. Even with the collaborative

89
00:05:32,025 --> 00:05:36,767
development style, the budget still ended up probably around $200,000, which is nothing

90
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:40,308
to balk at when dealing in the iOS space.

91
00:05:40,308 --> 00:05:41,288
Another big risk.

92
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,602
on the project was the fact that it was both a first game for both Super Brothers

93
00:05:45,602 --> 00:05:52,384
and for Jim Guthrie. Obviously first projects are extremely hard and everybody who's gone

94
00:05:52,384 --> 00:05:58,145
through that process of making their first game you know that it's a very dangerous

95
00:05:58,145 --> 00:06:02,947
rabbit hole to go down and to have two people going down that rabbit hole at the same time

96
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:09,168
on the same project provides a heck of a lot of risk. Now the game itself is often obscure,

97
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:11,149
it's intentionally self-aware.

98
00:06:11,878 --> 00:06:15,261
And the single biggest focus on the game is style and music.

99
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:19,884
All of those should set off huge warning alarms

100
00:06:19,884 --> 00:06:23,347
when we're thinking about the iOS space.

101
00:06:23,347 --> 00:06:26,629
Also, there is a relatively small amount of birds.

102
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:30,652
There is pretty much no fruit, and there's very little water.

103
00:06:30,652 --> 00:06:32,253
Anybody who looks at the charts will

104
00:06:32,253 --> 00:06:32,974
understand that that's a joke.

105
00:06:32,974 --> 00:06:40,179
All right, so let's look into a few of these specifically.

106
00:06:41,366 --> 00:06:44,889
Now, anybody, we gave a talk at IndieCade that kind of covered a bit of the collaboration

107
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:48,652
process, but for any of you who are there, sorry, I'm going to repeat a bunch of this,

108
00:06:48,652 --> 00:06:50,994
but deal with it.

109
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:55,958
So first, and perhaps the most important aspect of Sorcery that led to us making a standout

110
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:59,140
game and a successful game was how we leveraged collaboration.

111
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:03,304
Of course, collaboration isn't anything new in the independent scene, but I do think it's

112
00:07:03,304 --> 00:07:06,626
A, one of the opportunities that's most unique to the independent scene.

113
00:07:07,077 --> 00:07:11,699
And B, I think a lot of the collaboration in the independent scene happens kind of nepotistically

114
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:16,502
where developer A and developer B get together. In the case of Sorcery, it was collaboration

115
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:21,565
between an artist, illustrator, designer, and a musician who had never made music for

116
00:07:21,565 --> 00:07:27,749
games. And I think that it's also important to say that this was actually, you know, true

117
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:33,592
collaboration. This was people getting together in a room and listening to the ideas that

118
00:07:33,592 --> 00:07:34,213
they each had.

119
00:07:34,563 --> 00:07:37,804
Jim's role in the project wasn't just like, you make music.

120
00:07:37,804 --> 00:07:40,605
Jim would come down to the studio, sit in on meetings,

121
00:07:40,605 --> 00:07:45,387
and provide real quantifiable feedback and ideas

122
00:07:45,387 --> 00:07:46,347
for the game itself.

123
00:07:46,347 --> 00:07:50,209
So why is collaboration so important to business?

124
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:54,230
And how does collaboration increase the chances

125
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,191
for business success?

126
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:59,772
Well, first, there's a really important point here

127
00:07:59,772 --> 00:08:00,473
that I need to make.

128
00:08:00,473 --> 00:08:02,734
And it's making games that stand out

129
00:08:02,734 --> 00:08:03,994
is surprisingly important.

130
00:08:04,591 --> 00:08:08,374
for the business side of game development, especially for independent developers.

131
00:08:08,374 --> 00:08:16,742
I think it's one of those things where making a game is just as much about making a game that you care about

132
00:08:16,742 --> 00:08:20,145
as it is about making a game that you care about enough to make it stand out.

133
00:08:20,145 --> 00:08:26,691
What we did was we brought in different people that provided new perspectives

134
00:08:26,691 --> 00:08:29,593
on the actual development process.

135
00:08:30,085 --> 00:08:32,786
So the game's director, artist, and writer, Super Brothers,

136
00:08:32,786 --> 00:08:34,508
and the game's producer, Jim Guthrie,

137
00:08:34,508 --> 00:08:37,910
actually came in and provided their own unique piece

138
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:40,651
of standout power and actually built that into the game

139
00:08:40,651 --> 00:08:42,092
from the very ground up.

140
00:08:42,092 --> 00:08:45,054
So collaboration with Jim gave us standout music.

141
00:08:45,054 --> 00:08:48,376
But it also provided this unique perspective

142
00:08:48,376 --> 00:08:51,518
that we could make a game about music,

143
00:08:51,518 --> 00:08:54,020
that we could actually develop an entire title

144
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,601
around the music itself.

145
00:08:56,356 --> 00:08:59,577
Next, using collaboration as a core business and development

146
00:08:59,577 --> 00:09:01,758
component means that the vision of the game

147
00:09:01,758 --> 00:09:04,019
is inherently built into the team.

148
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:06,359
You don't have an idea, build a team around it,

149
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:08,920
and hope that you can spread that idea and vision out

150
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,041
to the people in the team.

151
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,581
The people in the team are the vision.

152
00:09:12,581 --> 00:09:15,182
There's a lot of time and a lot of money

153
00:09:15,182 --> 00:09:19,864
spent trying to convince people what the game is about,

154
00:09:19,864 --> 00:09:22,325
trying to convince employees or friends that you're

155
00:09:22,325 --> 00:09:23,725
working with the.

156
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:29,714
what your idea really is. But since the genesis of Sorcery was people coming together and

157
00:09:29,714 --> 00:09:33,938
collaborating on an idea, it meant that no one ever had to really question what the idea

158
00:09:33,938 --> 00:09:39,704
was. And it really, even though later on I'm going to talk about how much we went over

159
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:44,088
budget and over schedule and all that kind of stuff, this part of it, I think, actually

160
00:09:44,088 --> 00:09:48,953
saved us a ton of development time and a ton of money because we didn't have to worry that

161
00:09:48,953 --> 00:09:49,493
nobody got it.

162
00:09:52,297 --> 00:09:55,238
Now speaking straight from the like pay and money standpoint,

163
00:09:55,238 --> 00:09:57,360
collaboration has a huge benefit.

164
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,281
Everyone shares the financial risk.

165
00:09:59,281 --> 00:10:00,682
They share in the opportunity.

166
00:10:00,682 --> 00:10:03,924
And they also share in the opportunity cost.

167
00:10:03,924 --> 00:10:07,666
So basically, A, it means that if you get people to truly

168
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:11,109
collaborate with you, you can find ways to solve the,

169
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:13,090
I don't have enough money to make my game,

170
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,652
because everybody can get in from the ground up

171
00:10:15,652 --> 00:10:19,774
and know that making something together is the benefit,

172
00:10:19,774 --> 00:10:20,235
has the.

173
00:10:20,812 --> 00:10:22,353
ability to build a financial success.

174
00:10:22,353 --> 00:10:25,814
Collaboration also adds a lot of firepower.

175
00:10:25,814 --> 00:10:29,355
It means you get the supreme talent

176
00:10:29,355 --> 00:10:32,756
without having to actually go out and hire them.

177
00:10:32,756 --> 00:10:35,297
So when we started the project, we immediately

178
00:10:35,297 --> 00:10:39,438
got my favorite pixel artist without having

179
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:41,779
to go out and look for a favorite pixel

180
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:42,699
artist for the project.

181
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:46,500
You don't have to shove an employee or a friend

182
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,961
into a role that they don't fit.

183
00:10:49,587 --> 00:10:55,169
It means that if you have an amazing chiptunes musician who's your best friend or something,

184
00:10:55,169 --> 00:11:00,471
and you really want music for your project, but you really want that music to be ambient

185
00:11:00,471 --> 00:11:06,332
or maybe some drum and bass or something, you don't have to force them to make something

186
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,053
that they're not actually good at.

187
00:11:08,053 --> 00:11:13,335
And that really does avoid the risk of somebody really resenting the situation that they're

188
00:11:13,335 --> 00:11:14,675
in on a project.

189
00:11:16,573 --> 00:11:20,755
Now a really scary part about collaborating is the fact that you're likely adding people

190
00:11:20,755 --> 00:11:23,656
to a game that have never actually made a game before.

191
00:11:23,656 --> 00:11:30,458
And especially when you're talking about collaboration with people outside of the indie dev scene.

192
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:34,739
While Superbrothers had spent a bunch of time toiling away at Koei Canada, he had never

193
00:11:34,739 --> 00:11:37,079
actually made a full game.

194
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:41,921
Jim had never actually made music for a game, although he had made different formats of

195
00:11:41,921 --> 00:11:43,581
music for commercials or for himself.

196
00:11:44,715 --> 00:11:46,915
But the good thing is, the risk can actually be mitigated,

197
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,896
because you're adding experienced people or somebody

198
00:11:49,896 --> 00:11:53,397
who's made a project before, and kind of having those people

199
00:11:53,397 --> 00:11:54,677
back those people up.

200
00:11:54,677 --> 00:11:57,278
When mistakes are made, somebody's

201
00:11:57,278 --> 00:11:58,678
there to say, hey, no worries.

202
00:11:58,678 --> 00:12:01,038
Here's the direction we can actually go.

203
00:12:01,038 --> 00:12:03,419
And I think that in a kind of weird way,

204
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:06,000
although for a significant part of the project

205
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,841
we weren't doing this, I think that Cappy having made iOS

206
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:11,621
games before.

207
00:12:12,115 --> 00:12:18,018
solved some of the inexperienced problems that we had with bringing fresh people into

208
00:12:18,018 --> 00:12:18,818
making a game.

209
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:23,941
All right, let's move forward.

210
00:12:23,941 --> 00:12:27,362
So now there's a kind of an interesting distinction that I'd like to make here, and the distinction

211
00:12:27,362 --> 00:12:31,444
is there's collaboration and there's contributors.

212
00:12:31,444 --> 00:12:37,427
And another really huge component of the success of Sword & Sorcery was that we opened up the

213
00:12:37,427 --> 00:12:41,328
development of the game and almost the entire development process.

214
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:48,586
to contributors. It's a no cost, no risk, high reward bonus to having friends. And the

215
00:12:48,586 --> 00:12:53,250
best way that we could possibly think of to, you know, find contributors was to go out

216
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:58,235
for a beer with people, talk about the project with people, make some friends with people.

217
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:02,398
And then if they were at all interested, figure out if they were interested enough to help

218
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:04,660
us out a little bit here and there.

219
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,601
So for example...

220
00:13:06,042 --> 00:13:10,485
Our buddy Corey Schmitz decided, oh, you know, we're all friends and can I contribute to

221
00:13:10,485 --> 00:13:13,287
the project? Oh, I'll make this awesome print that you can see right here that ended up

222
00:13:13,287 --> 00:13:19,031
in the first run of the Sword & Sorcery LP. Or my pal Ron Carmel, I could send him a message

223
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:23,174
and say, I have no fucking clue what I'm doing, Ron, save me. And Ron would offer a piece

224
00:13:23,174 --> 00:13:28,057
of advice and we could figure stuff out. And it meant that none of these people were costing

225
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:32,480
money, none of these people were doing it for the wrong reasons, and all of them were

226
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,683
providing a real tangible benefit to the project.

227
00:13:39,184 --> 00:13:41,925
So we're going to have awesome fire flame effects going on

228
00:13:41,925 --> 00:13:43,146
here.

229
00:13:43,146 --> 00:13:46,327
So people like Brandon Boyer, Robert Ashley, Corey Schmitz,

230
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:49,829
Scientific, Ron Carmel, Charlene Chua, Clive Holden,

231
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:54,131
Mark Rabbo, Craig's brother, Mac, even people like Penn Ward,

232
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:56,892
who makes Adventure Time, all got in touch with us

233
00:13:56,892 --> 00:13:59,413
or were friends of ours that we got in touch with.

234
00:13:59,413 --> 00:14:02,134
And we could actually, when we had a question,

235
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:04,595
we could find an answer that wasn't just

236
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:05,816
coming from internally.

237
00:14:05,816 --> 00:14:07,217
And I think that's also super important,

238
00:14:07,217 --> 00:14:08,477
because everybody knows that.

239
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:12,993
At a certain point in your project, you're so deep in your project that you don't know

240
00:14:12,993 --> 00:14:17,574
what you're doing. You don't know if it's good, you don't know if there's even an end

241
00:14:17,574 --> 00:14:21,675
to it. So having those outside perspectives really help a lot. That's Mark Rabbo doing

242
00:14:21,675 --> 00:14:26,716
a poppa wheelie, by the way. He's a badass.

243
00:14:26,716 --> 00:14:33,078
So another kind of, like, weird thing, and I always kind of feel strange talking about

244
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:38,599
this because it sounds like I'm totally using people, and maybe we were.

245
00:14:39,107 --> 00:14:43,509
But one of these weird benefits of having people contribute to your projects is it grows

246
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:48,931
the number of eyeballs on your project, and it grows them in the best possible way.

247
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:53,272
Contributors will only contribute to your project if they actually believe in the project.

248
00:14:53,272 --> 00:14:58,294
So no one's going to donate time or effort or something awesome to a project that they

249
00:14:58,294 --> 00:14:58,694
think sucks.

250
00:14:58,694 --> 00:15:03,496
And if they believe in those projects, they're going to talk about that project.

251
00:15:03,496 --> 00:15:07,857
They're going to be interested in being involved and interested in spreading their involvement.

252
00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:12,701
we had a whole ton of people comment that they couldn't believe that Logfella was actually

253
00:15:12,701 --> 00:15:18,943
voiced by Robert Ashley. And that was something that got talked about a lot. And that was

254
00:15:18,943 --> 00:15:25,346
an amazing scenario where, you know, Craig talks to Robert Ashley, Robert Ashley decides

255
00:15:25,346 --> 00:15:30,728
to, you know, record a whole bunch of joke statements as a dry run for getting a voice

256
00:15:30,728 --> 00:15:36,230
to Logfella, and then Craig decided that those were actually perfect for the voice, and there

257
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,251
was no final recording.

258
00:15:39,193 --> 00:15:43,357
And it provides this kind of unique thing because any fan of Robert Ashley

259
00:15:43,357 --> 00:15:47,100
is going to hear Robert Ashley talking about the game because he actually

260
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,682
really cared about the game.

261
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:54,947
Further, and I think most importantly, it has this amazing fringe

262
00:15:54,947 --> 00:15:58,250
benefit of community building. It extends the reach of the entire

263
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:02,854
independent game scene from just, you know, the people in the scene to

264
00:16:02,854 --> 00:16:05,897
people outside of it. It draws in people of different talents.

265
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:11,924
and of different interests, and lets them experience how amazing this community actually

266
00:16:11,924 --> 00:16:14,745
is, and entices them to become more active in that community.

267
00:16:14,745 --> 00:16:21,588
So the next key component that I'm going to talk about is making the concrete decision

268
00:16:21,588 --> 00:16:31,772
to be risky. Games probably shouldn't just trip and fall and end up being risky. You

269
00:16:31,772 --> 00:16:34,753
should probably go into a project

270
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:39,192
at least on a high level, knowing what you're getting into.

271
00:16:39,192 --> 00:16:42,495
And you should know that a risky project is risky,

272
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:47,920
and you should make the definite decision to leverage that risk to your benefit.

273
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,884
So, I personally believe that one of the scariest parts

274
00:16:52,884 --> 00:16:55,266
of the massive success of the iOS platform

275
00:16:55,266 --> 00:17:00,190
is that it's taught everyone, and in a lot of ways, especially independent developers,

276
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,871
that they should try to make games for everyone.

277
00:17:02,575 --> 00:17:06,577
Seems like an obvious choice because games like Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja and Cut the Rope,

278
00:17:06,577 --> 00:17:10,799
and I could probably list a ton of others, sold 10 million, 20 million copies.

279
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:17,342
But believe it or not, I actually think that that's a really, really bad business move.

280
00:17:17,342 --> 00:17:19,724
Everyone actually isn't a demographic.

281
00:17:19,724 --> 00:17:24,486
Everyone is not a target and everyone are not the people that you care about as a game developer.

282
00:17:24,486 --> 00:17:27,847
When you say everyone, when you say, oh, I'm making a game for everyone,

283
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:30,349
it actually means that you're not really making a game for anyone.

284
00:17:31,878 --> 00:17:34,260
Everyone wants to make a million-selling game.

285
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,481
That's a fact, and that's totally cool.

286
00:17:35,481 --> 00:17:37,563
But the problem with the hit-based mentality

287
00:17:37,563 --> 00:17:39,705
is it puts you in direct competition

288
00:17:39,705 --> 00:17:41,126
with all the other people who have

289
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,468
the same hit-based mentality, the people that

290
00:17:43,468 --> 00:17:46,771
aren't creative enough to make a unique game,

291
00:17:46,771 --> 00:17:48,313
and the people who aren't willing to take

292
00:17:48,313 --> 00:17:51,756
the risks necessary to develop something that actually

293
00:17:51,756 --> 00:17:55,640
has a soul or is fresh or flies in the face

294
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,560
of conventional wisdom.

295
00:17:58,803 --> 00:18:02,725
Internally at Cappy, we always talk a lot about playing the iPhone lottery.

296
00:18:02,725 --> 00:18:08,708
And basically, that's what happens when you try to compete against everyone else who's

297
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,149
trying to do the same thing.

298
00:18:10,149 --> 00:18:14,452
You're trying to make the next Angry Birds, so what you're doing is basically walking

299
00:18:14,452 --> 00:18:18,054
up to a slot machine, putting the budget of your game into the slot, pulling the lever,

300
00:18:18,054 --> 00:18:21,256
and praying to God you get three fucking cherries.

301
00:18:21,256 --> 00:18:26,358
In reality, one in ten thousand maybe do okay.

302
00:18:26,358 --> 00:18:27,519
Maybe even worse than that.

303
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:28,420
I don't even know the odds.

304
00:18:29,499 --> 00:18:34,121
But instead, I really think that Sorcery provides some proof that there's another avenue to

305
00:18:34,121 --> 00:18:37,422
success on the iOS platform. And I do think that this actually does translate as well

306
00:18:37,422 --> 00:18:42,604
to other digital distribution platforms. It's not iOS specific necessarily, but because

307
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:45,766
I should only talk about what I know, that's all I'm going to do.

308
00:18:45,766 --> 00:18:51,688
So I believe that, you know, there is that kind of different path to success on iOS.

309
00:18:51,688 --> 00:18:55,590
And to be clear, making a sports game

310
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:59,591
or games for fans of arcade games isn't a niche.

311
00:18:59,591 --> 00:19:02,712
It's too wide, it's too generic, and it doesn't actually

312
00:19:02,712 --> 00:19:06,154
allow you to do any direct speaking to the consumer base.

313
00:19:06,154 --> 00:19:08,254
For Sorcery, the niche that we targeted was,

314
00:19:08,254 --> 00:19:11,316
I'm going to air quote here, a culturally literate audience

315
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,037
who are interested in style, the blending of games and art,

316
00:19:14,037 --> 00:19:16,958
and who want music to be a core component of game design.

317
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:19,959
This is a very specific audience, or so we thought.

318
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:25,051
When we started making the game, we kind of thought,

319
00:19:25,051 --> 00:19:27,413
yeah, that's probably 20,000 people, I don't know,

320
00:19:27,413 --> 00:19:30,896
maybe enough people that we could probably make our money back on the project.

321
00:19:30,896 --> 00:19:35,640
But we also didn't know if there was actually 2.5 million people in that niche,

322
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,861
or 20 million people in that niche.

323
00:19:36,861 --> 00:19:39,123
But we knew that it was a specific enough group of people

324
00:19:39,123 --> 00:19:41,265
that they would understand what we were saying to them.

325
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:46,549
Another great example might be Kairosoft's micromanagement games.

326
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:52,843
where, you know, to me that style of game is extremely kind of niche-y, yet it's, you

327
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:56,405
know, games like Game Dev Story have been massive financial successes.

328
00:19:56,405 --> 00:20:03,628
What we've learned and what I believe to be factually true is that due to the massive

329
00:20:03,628 --> 00:20:10,071
proliferation and popularity of iOS devices, you can have the seemingly smallest niche

330
00:20:10,071 --> 00:20:14,273
and that niche can actually be quite large.

331
00:20:14,273 --> 00:20:16,174
Oh, cool, my graph is gone.

332
00:20:17,742 --> 00:20:20,684
That's, okay, it's a mushroom.

333
00:20:20,684 --> 00:20:22,365
There's supposed to be some numbers on that slide,

334
00:20:22,365 --> 00:20:23,345
but it's not there anymore.

335
00:20:23,345 --> 00:20:30,229
That mushroom actually represents a graph

336
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,111
that shows that two-thirds of our sales

337
00:20:33,111 --> 00:20:34,932
were on iPad and Universal.

338
00:20:34,932 --> 00:20:37,634
So just, we'll put on the,

339
00:20:37,634 --> 00:20:41,196
we'll put on goggles and pretend that we see that.

340
00:20:41,196 --> 00:20:43,958
So as I mentioned, we're targeting literate players.

341
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,498
Because of this, we knew we could take...

342
00:20:46,307 --> 00:20:50,870
steps after that to actually understanding who the audience for the game actually were

343
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,792
and making real smart business decisions based on that.

344
00:20:53,792 --> 00:20:57,994
So one belief that came out of knowing who we were targeting was that many players who

345
00:20:57,994 --> 00:21:02,217
would care about Sorcery would probably want to play it on an iPad.

346
00:21:02,217 --> 00:21:06,420
Now through this we decided to like spend most of our time leading up to the game's

347
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:11,443
launch making sure that the iPad version was as perfect as possible.

348
00:21:11,957 --> 00:21:16,241
kind of in conflict with traditional business sense, which would say there's ten times more

349
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:21,685
iPhones than there are iPads, why not put it out for everything? But for us it was really

350
00:21:21,685 --> 00:21:25,528
more important to make sure that the people who we thought would be kind of like the core

351
00:21:25,528 --> 00:21:32,574
consumer to get the best experience possible first. And in this case, our hunch turned

352
00:21:32,574 --> 00:21:36,917
out to be pretty right because the game did extremely well, hit number four on iPad before

353
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:41,321
even getting featured. And perhaps one of the most interesting things is...

354
00:21:41,695 --> 00:21:47,617
Two-thirds of all of our sales were on iPad, or once we turned it universal, universal.

355
00:21:47,617 --> 00:21:52,278
And even more than that, over three-quarters of the entire revenue in the project was generated

356
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:52,918
from those builds.

357
00:21:52,918 --> 00:21:57,919
So when we went out and said, we think that these people are going to be on those platforms

358
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:03,401
because we want to play it on those platforms, I think that that turned out to be correct.

359
00:22:03,401 --> 00:22:07,622
And another kind of interesting fact about Sword & Sorcery on the kind of knowing your

360
00:22:07,622 --> 00:22:08,382
audience side.

361
00:22:08,893 --> 00:22:11,494
is that only 10% of our total sales

362
00:22:11,494 --> 00:22:13,255
were generated during sale periods.

363
00:22:13,255 --> 00:22:16,876
So even when we put the game on sale like crazy,

364
00:22:16,876 --> 00:22:19,777
it still really didn't mean that much to us

365
00:22:19,777 --> 00:22:22,158
from a big financial success standpoint.

366
00:22:22,158 --> 00:22:25,759
We knew that the people that we were making the game for

367
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:30,260
were the people in this room and the people like us.

368
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,601
And we knew that if they were interested in this project,

369
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,862
they would be interested enough to buy it at the price

370
00:22:34,862 --> 00:22:37,363
that we thought was correct for it.

371
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:41,744
and I think that that's pretty awesome.

372
00:22:41,744 --> 00:22:46,348
Now, I definitely don't want to stand up here and be that dude that says, like,

373
00:22:46,348 --> 00:22:49,751
you should make a game this way, this is the right way to do it, only do it this way.

374
00:22:49,751 --> 00:22:52,734
Everybody, you know, should be making the games they want to make.

375
00:22:52,734 --> 00:22:56,637
But I also think that if you love your project enough,

376
00:22:56,637 --> 00:22:59,760
you should be putting the effort in to make it stand out.

377
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,765
And it's very important that your game does that, that your game does stand out.

378
00:23:05,413 --> 00:23:10,476
because as we all know, digital platforms, especially the App Store, are a fucking sea of games.

379
00:23:10,476 --> 00:23:17,699
And basically every day that sea's tide rises is 10,000 or whatever it is, more games get added to the store.

380
00:23:17,699 --> 00:23:25,323
In the case of Certain Sorcery, you know, we're talking specifically about iOS, but I also do think that this is, you know,

381
00:23:25,323 --> 00:23:29,306
happening slowly but surely on other digital distribution platforms as well.

382
00:23:29,306 --> 00:23:34,788
And the interesting thing about digital platforms is that while all the games are competing with each other,

383
00:23:35,428 --> 00:23:41,331
Most of them are actually slightly different variations of the last one.

384
00:23:41,331 --> 00:23:43,712
You know, shooter A, B, C, X, Y, and Z,

385
00:23:43,712 --> 00:23:46,534
or semi-generic real-time strategy A, B, C, or X, Y, Z.

386
00:23:46,534 --> 00:23:54,998
And I personally think that gamers out there are smart enough to know that going into a store.

387
00:23:54,998 --> 00:23:59,420
They know that they're getting into a situation where they're going onto a platform that has

388
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:03,662
thousands and thousands of games that are almost exactly the same.

389
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:10,342
Different and risky games, in reality, are a very much rare thing.

390
00:24:10,342 --> 00:24:16,345
On iOS, I'm going to throw out some numbers based on a complete and utter guess,

391
00:24:16,345 --> 00:24:21,587
I think maybe 1-2% of all games on iOS fall into that risky category.

392
00:24:21,587 --> 00:24:27,869
So when standing out is so critical, is making something risky really that risky?

393
00:24:27,869 --> 00:24:31,531
Or is it actually riskier to make something that doesn't stand out,

394
00:24:31,531 --> 00:24:34,112
something that is kind of more generic or...

395
00:24:34,522 --> 00:24:40,106
making design or business decisions to make your game appeal to a wider audience,

396
00:24:40,106 --> 00:24:44,110
thus watering it down and eliminating some of the perceived risk,

397
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:48,813
but actually making it have much less, if no chance, of standing out on the platform.

398
00:24:48,813 --> 00:24:53,357
So the reason for this is pretty simple.

399
00:24:53,357 --> 00:24:59,983
There are a subset of gamers, maybe a large subset of gamers,

400
00:24:59,983 --> 00:25:01,644
who actually just want to play something new.

401
00:25:02,903 --> 00:25:06,665
If you provide them something worth playing, you're not actually competing against 99%

402
00:25:06,665 --> 00:25:12,129
of the market. You're competing against the other risky games or the 1%. Sure, you might

403
00:25:12,129 --> 00:25:16,632
not be reaching for the biggest slice of the money pie, but you're ensuring that your project

404
00:25:16,632 --> 00:25:23,797
has a really good chance of A, being successful, and B, being successful the right way. Communicating

405
00:25:23,797 --> 00:25:29,201
with people that you care about as a game developer. And I think it's, you know, really

406
00:25:29,652 --> 00:25:35,474
critical to spend the time to think about who you're making the game for. I'm totally

407
00:25:35,474 --> 00:25:40,736
– I love games that are made by people for themselves, but the reality is that even when

408
00:25:40,736 --> 00:25:44,777
you're making a game for yourself, there's a whole lot of other people out there, a lot

409
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:47,778
of them are in this room and a lot of them can't even make it here, that are the same

410
00:25:47,778 --> 00:25:50,459
as you, and they want to play your stuff.

411
00:25:50,459 --> 00:25:58,242
So the next component of the talk dives into one of the hardest parts of making a risky

412
00:25:58,242 --> 00:25:58,442
game.

413
00:25:59,326 --> 00:26:04,107
uh... keeping calm in the face of insanely ridiculous piles of shit that

414
00:26:04,107 --> 00:26:06,607
you have to eat in order to complete a game

415
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:09,428
and then actually completing it the right way

416
00:26:09,428 --> 00:26:13,329
so in short i'm gonna use the ridiculously overused adage of keep calm

417
00:26:13,329 --> 00:26:13,889
and carry on

418
00:26:13,889 --> 00:26:20,510
the games that everyone in this room are are are making

419
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:25,591
uh... are probably the easiest games in the world to go over schedule and over

420
00:26:25,591 --> 00:26:26,752
budget

421
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:28,892
they're games that are trying to do outside of the known

422
00:26:29,228 --> 00:26:31,990
They're usually experimental in some way, shape, or form.

423
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:35,412
And they're pretty much always personal games.

424
00:26:35,412 --> 00:26:37,693
This is a dangerous concoction that

425
00:26:37,693 --> 00:26:40,915
means the schedules get missed and budgets get flushed

426
00:26:40,915 --> 00:26:42,115
down the toilet very easily.

427
00:26:42,115 --> 00:26:45,857
And we all know that this is stressful as fuck.

428
00:26:45,857 --> 00:26:47,898
The stress isn't just a personal one.

429
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:50,600
They're like, I need to finish my game,

430
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,221
or we need to finish our game, or we're a failure.

431
00:26:53,221 --> 00:26:55,902
But it's also a business stress.

432
00:26:55,902 --> 00:26:57,943
So I had this discussion with some friends a while ago.

433
00:26:58,482 --> 00:27:03,584
And over the course of this discussion, I came to this weird understanding that all

434
00:27:03,584 --> 00:27:09,667
independent developers are inherently entrepreneurs. There's a built-in entrepreneurial component

435
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:17,171
of making and releasing your own stuff. And while you're not necessarily looking at it

436
00:27:17,171 --> 00:27:22,313
as an entrepreneurial venture, while you're not thinking business first, if you're putting

437
00:27:22,313 --> 00:27:27,335
out a game to the public for sale, that is something that you kind of have to come to

438
00:27:27,335 --> 00:27:27,795
terms with.

439
00:27:28,283 --> 00:27:34,006
And going over budget, going over schedule puts a significant amount of stress on the

440
00:27:34,006 --> 00:27:40,689
business component of what you're doing. And this stress pretty much exclusively leads

441
00:27:40,689 --> 00:27:46,571
to making really stupid calls. I am over budget. I need to finish the game. I don't have any

442
00:27:46,571 --> 00:27:50,973
money so I'll sign with a publisher because they're gonna give me money. I might even

443
00:27:50,973 --> 00:27:54,475
not read the contract because, God, I just gotta finish the game.

444
00:27:55,064 --> 00:27:59,687
Or another one is, I'm over schedule, I'm terrified of losing my slot on a distribution

445
00:27:59,687 --> 00:28:04,009
platform, so I'm just going to hire a bunch of really smart people that I don't know to

446
00:28:04,009 --> 00:28:06,531
cram on the game for three months and finish it.

447
00:28:06,531 --> 00:28:14,516
There's like a laundry list of those kind of difficult and poor business decisions that

448
00:28:14,516 --> 00:28:19,619
come out of the stress of your project going longer than you want it to.

449
00:28:22,783 --> 00:28:26,324
But in the end, the only way to finish these games is to sacrifice something.

450
00:28:26,324 --> 00:28:30,825
The sacrifice is sometimes personal, and it's almost always a business sacrifice.

451
00:28:30,825 --> 00:28:39,586
But what I mean from sacrifice is, you know, going to your parents and sucking it up and asking for some money.

452
00:28:39,586 --> 00:28:44,927
And I know pretty much every project that everybody's ever done has had that moment

453
00:28:44,927 --> 00:28:50,068
where you need to go somewhere and do something that requires you to just suck it up and ask for it.

454
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,628
you know, that is a big sacrifice.

455
00:28:52,628 --> 00:28:56,571
You sacrifice pride, or it even could involve, you know,

456
00:28:56,571 --> 00:29:01,255
changing the scope of the project while not losing the vision.

457
00:29:01,255 --> 00:29:08,140
So, here's what happened to us, to the extreme, during sorcery.

458
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:11,702
So here's a little bit of history here.

459
00:29:12,487 --> 00:29:17,951
After Chris and Craig and I sobered up after the meeting that we had at GDC where we were

460
00:29:17,951 --> 00:29:21,194
super hammered and yelled at each other and grabbed each other and shook each other about

461
00:29:21,194 --> 00:29:26,159
making a game, we came back to Toronto and started planning out the actual collaboration

462
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,523
that was going to be Sorcery. We figured, yeah, shit, we can make a crazy little iOS

463
00:29:30,523 --> 00:29:35,427
game in eight to ten months. Yeah, no problem. And shit, we could probably fund it with like

464
00:29:35,427 --> 00:29:38,149
a hundred and ten thousand dollars. That's crazy. That's lots of money.

465
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:44,333
So, you know, and we got a little bit of help from the Ontario government, so we figured,

466
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:47,596
well, shit, this isn't risky, this is no problem, we're going to totally hit this.

467
00:29:47,596 --> 00:29:53,380
And this was at a phase during Cappy's life when, you know, if it went over budget, it

468
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:56,202
was going to be a big fucking problem.

469
00:29:56,202 --> 00:30:03,007
So we put together the IGF GDC demo, and Super Brothers Art won the IGF Mobile Art Award,

470
00:30:03,007 --> 00:30:07,230
and we were, you know, riding really high, and then we got back to Toronto and started

471
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,270
working on the actual game.

472
00:30:08,886 --> 00:30:16,050
And then seven or eight months passed, and we kind of realized that we weren't even half

473
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:21,973
done. So we had about two to three months from the original schedule to finish something

474
00:30:21,973 --> 00:30:29,476
that we kind of didn't even really know what it was. So we were just kind of like trying

475
00:30:29,476 --> 00:30:33,338
to find the project, trying to figure out what it was, and this harsh reality set in.

476
00:30:33,338 --> 00:30:38,621
This project is going to go really, really long and really over budget.

477
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:42,460
and so as one of the guys who was overseeing the whole kind of like

478
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:45,262
schedule and financial component of the project

479
00:30:45,262 --> 00:30:50,307
i stepped in and started making these kind of crazy plans to slash and burn

480
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:53,189
sorcery to get it out in three months

481
00:30:53,189 --> 00:30:53,789
uh... craig

482
00:30:53,789 --> 00:30:57,272
who was uh... already knee deep in the project

483
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,894
uh... and who trusted me

484
00:30:58,894 --> 00:31:01,836
kinda came along on that ride was like yeah okay let's let's cut all this

485
00:31:01,836 --> 00:31:03,958
crazy shit let's finish it in three months or so

486
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:07,080
uh... and at the time because of the stress we had

487
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,321
uh...

488
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,041
that seemed like the smart call.

489
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:12,221
But it was really the stress talking.

490
00:31:12,221 --> 00:31:17,502
So in a meeting with Cappy's creative director, Chris,

491
00:31:17,502 --> 00:31:20,283
who at that time was starting to play a giant role in what

492
00:31:20,283 --> 00:31:23,583
the project became, we kind of came to this understanding.

493
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:26,784
And the understanding was that it was a far bigger risk

494
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:30,064
to Cappy, to Superbrothers, and to Jim, as a business,

495
00:31:30,064 --> 00:31:32,585
to hustle through some half-baked game

496
00:31:32,585 --> 00:31:34,325
and then throw it out.

497
00:31:35,742 --> 00:31:44,587
We realized that finishing the game, finding more money, taking more time was actually less of a business risk than throwing out garbage.

498
00:31:44,587 --> 00:31:49,369
So this risk required way more trust from everyone around.

499
00:31:49,369 --> 00:31:54,632
We had to trust that Chris and Craig together could solve many of the design issues around the project.

500
00:31:54,632 --> 00:32:01,376
I had to trust that Chris playing a larger role in the project could help be that driving factor that I personally couldn't be.

501
00:32:01,852 --> 00:32:06,375
We had to trust that Super Brothers could keep working on the project when his money had ran out

502
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:09,798
and his soul was pushed to the brink,

503
00:32:09,798 --> 00:32:13,662
when he was at his darkest moment that he could actually go on.

504
00:32:13,662 --> 00:32:18,986
We had to trust that Jim would continue to work on the project and be a key part of that project

505
00:32:18,986 --> 00:32:21,509
long after his music had actually been created.

506
00:32:21,509 --> 00:32:27,234
So the real big business decision, and the one that had the biggest impact on Sorcery,

507
00:32:27,234 --> 00:32:29,976
was the intense belief in a very simple statement.

508
00:32:30,455 --> 00:32:33,936
A rushed game will not sell as well as a finished game.

509
00:32:33,936 --> 00:32:38,597
In hindsight, this is doubly true with the projects that most people in this room create.

510
00:32:38,597 --> 00:32:46,119
They're riskier, they're more explorative, and then by definition, an unfinished version

511
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:48,239
of that is just not going to touch the right people.

512
00:32:48,239 --> 00:32:55,241
Another purely business component to that decision was these weird but insanely huge

513
00:32:55,241 --> 00:32:59,102
intangibles that come out of finishing a project correctly.

514
00:33:00,136 --> 00:33:04,960
Beyond the critical success of Sorcery, we've had this kind of beautiful storm of business

515
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:10,925
benefit, all of which comes from the fact that we took the time to actually finish it.

516
00:33:10,925 --> 00:33:17,270
I'm probably up here talking to everybody because there's this belief that Sorcery was

517
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:17,470
a hit.

518
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:19,932
In a lot of ways, it really was.

519
00:33:19,932 --> 00:33:26,277
But if you compare it to what a hit is on iOS, we're like 10% of the way to a hit.

520
00:33:26,277 --> 00:33:27,638
You know, 350,000 copies.

521
00:33:28,471 --> 00:33:32,593
in typical iOS logic, a hit does not make.

522
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:37,456
But when we talk about the project with anyone,

523
00:33:37,456 --> 00:33:41,578
with everyone, the tone of the discussion is like, wow,

524
00:33:41,578 --> 00:33:44,779
you guys made something cool, and it was a hit.

525
00:33:44,779 --> 00:33:48,961
And that really makes it easier to talk

526
00:33:48,961 --> 00:33:50,642
about making your next project with anyone,

527
00:33:50,642 --> 00:33:54,244
whether it's the people around you,

528
00:33:54,244 --> 00:33:56,325
or it's a distributor.

529
00:33:56,939 --> 00:34:01,782
the App Store like Steam or like anything else. Finishing a game, especially a risky

530
00:34:01,782 --> 00:34:07,945
game well, opens these immeasurable amount of doors for whatever you want to do next.

531
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:14,068
And I really do think that it had this kind of fringe benefit for everybody involved.

532
00:34:14,068 --> 00:34:17,690
This isn't just a cappy benefit. I mean, I think a lot of the reason why Jim got to

533
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:23,033
do such amazing music on Indie Game the Movie was because Indie Game the Movie

534
00:34:23,915 --> 00:34:29,357
heard it, James and Lisanne heard it in Sorcery. And I think that that happened because the

535
00:34:29,357 --> 00:34:34,100
dialogue of the game was one of like, this was a success. And I don't know about you

536
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:38,902
guys, but I really, really like working on projects that when they're done, that's the

537
00:34:38,902 --> 00:34:46,986
tone. And it's really motivational. Okay, so here's a, here's, you know, I feel like

538
00:34:46,986 --> 00:34:51,088
I've kind of crammed in like, this is my like fifth awesome buzzword.

539
00:34:51,854 --> 00:34:53,355
in my presentation.

540
00:34:53,355 --> 00:34:54,957
PR voice, what is that?

541
00:34:54,957 --> 00:34:57,619
That sounds stupid.

542
00:34:57,619 --> 00:34:58,240
I apologize for that.

543
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,922
But I think it's a very important lesson

544
00:35:00,922 --> 00:35:02,903
that we learned on the promotional side

545
00:35:02,903 --> 00:35:06,546
of the project, which was everyone working on the project

546
00:35:06,546 --> 00:35:08,508
understood the voice of the project.

547
00:35:08,508 --> 00:35:11,550
And we could actually make the concrete decision

548
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:14,453
to leverage that all the way through promotion of the game.

549
00:35:14,453 --> 00:35:15,894
We didn't just finish the game.

550
00:35:16,264 --> 00:35:21,107
and then throw a bunch of like bullet points, like 55 different levels, you know, you can

551
00:35:21,107 --> 00:35:27,391
take a million steps. We just, we chose to make every part of the promotion of the game

552
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:33,855
an extension of the vision of the game. So I got, I got a really awesome chart here that

553
00:35:33,855 --> 00:35:38,438
I'm sure you all understand immediately, right? It makes total sense. So let me explain this

554
00:35:38,438 --> 00:35:42,800
a bit. Normally, and especially when you're working with publishers, there's this waterfall

555
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,522
flow that starts with the game's vision.

556
00:35:44,973 --> 00:35:49,155
The vision informs the game, and then when the game is done,

557
00:35:49,155 --> 00:35:53,257
the game itself defines all the promotion for that game.

558
00:35:53,257 --> 00:35:54,878
And that's kind of stupid.

559
00:35:54,878 --> 00:35:57,459
In Sorcery, we took a completely different approach

560
00:35:57,459 --> 00:35:58,720
to that typical model.

561
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,101
So the vision definitely informed the game,

562
00:36:01,101 --> 00:36:04,483
but the vision also informed the PR

563
00:36:04,483 --> 00:36:07,225
just as much as the game itself or more than the game itself.

564
00:36:08,534 --> 00:36:14,338
Pretty much all of the promotion we did for the game, the trailers, Super Brothers, Teletext emails,

565
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:20,081
even the actual sale periods for the game are tied into the vision for the project.

566
00:36:20,081 --> 00:36:24,283
And that means that everything feels like a part of a whole.

567
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:27,365
Why do you want to do this?

568
00:36:27,365 --> 00:36:28,946
That sounds crazy still.

569
00:36:28,946 --> 00:36:33,468
So, anyone who enjoys the promotions for the game...

570
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:39,053
will likely enjoy the game itself. It's much more honest and it allows for honest communication

571
00:36:39,053 --> 00:36:44,698
between you as a developer and the people who are going to be interested in your game.

572
00:36:44,698 --> 00:36:49,361
You're not going to end up in a scenario where you trick someone into being interested in

573
00:36:49,361 --> 00:36:53,845
your game by selling them something that your game isn't, if the promotion for the game

574
00:36:53,845 --> 00:37:00,430
is an extension of the vision of the game itself. So promotion with vision will make

575
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:02,271
your game stand out plain and simple.

576
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:10,223
So we put out that Sword & Sorcery audience calibration trailer

577
00:37:10,223 --> 00:37:14,746
and it's got 350,000 views just on the Vimeo alone.

578
00:37:14,746 --> 00:37:18,068
And I think the main reason why people were attracted to that trailer was

579
00:37:18,068 --> 00:37:19,469
because

580
00:37:19,469 --> 00:37:22,091
the trailer wasn't really about the game.

581
00:37:22,091 --> 00:37:25,793
The trailer was about the tone of the game and the language of the game and

582
00:37:25,793 --> 00:37:26,814
the vision of the game.

583
00:37:26,814 --> 00:37:31,316
There's really not that much of the game in that trailer.

584
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:31,637
But...

585
00:37:31,993 --> 00:37:36,635
that trailer really spoke about the game.

586
00:37:36,635 --> 00:37:37,536
Now another kind of like,

587
00:37:37,536 --> 00:37:41,078
I talked a bit about target the niche,

588
00:37:41,078 --> 00:37:42,218
like try to get 100% of the 10%.

589
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:46,201
And when you're communicating the vision

590
00:37:46,201 --> 00:37:48,802
rather than just selling bullet points,

591
00:37:48,802 --> 00:37:52,324
you actually have this really great communication

592
00:37:52,324 --> 00:37:53,785
with that niche.

593
00:37:53,785 --> 00:37:57,086
It gives them kind of like an extra step into your mind,

594
00:37:57,086 --> 00:37:59,808
and it gives them points to discuss them with you.

595
00:37:59,808 --> 00:38:01,209
So after that trailer came out,

596
00:38:02,294 --> 00:38:07,796
Craig, fortunately, who is very Twitter-friendly, and Chris, who is very Twitter-friendly, and

597
00:38:07,796 --> 00:38:13,217
myself, who, pretty Twitter-friendly, had discussions with people about the trailer

598
00:38:13,217 --> 00:38:15,658
itself and how it related to the game.

599
00:38:15,658 --> 00:38:25,341
OK. So, also, this is a business talk. So that means that I'm gonna talk a bit about

600
00:38:25,341 --> 00:38:27,361
brand. Brand.

601
00:38:29,291 --> 00:38:34,335
The thing that you don't want to do is try to force your game or the branding and brand

602
00:38:34,335 --> 00:38:37,378
of your game outside of a space that it doesn't exist in.

603
00:38:37,378 --> 00:38:40,400
You're not going to try to just say, like, all right, my game is going to do this, so

604
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,665
I'm just going to shove all the marketing in this direction so that it ends up being

605
00:38:45,665 --> 00:38:47,786
what I think it should be.

606
00:38:47,786 --> 00:38:54,572
Using the vision that started and is the foundation of the project as your kind of key informer

607
00:38:54,572 --> 00:38:57,595
for promotion allows you to just basically let it grow.

608
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,431
You don't even have to worry about it.

609
00:38:59,431 --> 00:39:00,631
It's just going to do that.

610
00:39:00,631 --> 00:39:04,272
So even something as specific as Clive Holden, who's this

611
00:39:04,272 --> 00:39:06,773
really awesome dude from Toronto who makes short films

612
00:39:06,773 --> 00:39:10,334
and some new media stuff and a whole bunch of other things,

613
00:39:10,334 --> 00:39:14,655
when we convinced him to do the voice of the archetype in

614
00:39:14,655 --> 00:39:17,656
the trailer, it was this real obvious extension of the

615
00:39:17,656 --> 00:39:18,897
vision, like, yeah, sure.

616
00:39:18,897 --> 00:39:21,077
Of course our friend Clive is the voice of the archetype.

617
00:39:21,077 --> 00:39:21,898
Why wouldn't he be?

618
00:39:21,898 --> 00:39:24,898
And he sounds the way that he should sound.

619
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:29,453
We didn't try to go out and hire some awesome voice actor.

620
00:39:29,453 --> 00:39:31,695
We found people who we really thought

621
00:39:31,695 --> 00:39:33,917
fit the vision of the game and also

622
00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:36,940
the vision of the development.

623
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,201
So how do you do this?

624
00:39:38,201 --> 00:39:42,364
I'll run through this very quickly.

625
00:39:42,364 --> 00:39:47,348
Take the core values, the ideas, the aesthetics, the tone,

626
00:39:47,348 --> 00:39:49,890
and the soul of the game, and just

627
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:51,632
let that be the promotion.

628
00:39:52,259 --> 00:39:56,042
Kurt is going to come up here and talk about how to make rad trailers, and you should listen

629
00:39:56,042 --> 00:40:00,585
to everything he has to say, because pretty much all he does is make rad trailers. But

630
00:40:00,585 --> 00:40:06,229
I think the reason why they work so well is because they're all about having soul. They're

631
00:40:06,229 --> 00:40:10,872
all about putting something out there that speaks about the game.

632
00:40:10,872 --> 00:40:16,736
Another big thing is maintaining a common written voice for stuff like web and promotion

633
00:40:16,736 --> 00:40:18,177
and trailers and social media.

634
00:40:18,698 --> 00:40:23,379
and so on. Making sure that it all sounds the way that you want it to sound.

635
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:30,402
This is going to sound like I feel kind of dumb saying this, but

636
00:40:30,402 --> 00:40:34,583
don't use fonts that you don't use in the game in your promotion.

637
00:40:34,583 --> 00:40:37,504
Don't use colors that you don't use in the game in the promotion.

638
00:40:37,504 --> 00:40:41,585
Don't use sound effects that you source from a site that you just found

639
00:40:41,585 --> 00:40:44,266
in order to just have that one sound in the trailer.

640
00:40:44,266 --> 00:40:46,086
None of it is going to feel like a cohesive piece

641
00:40:46,086 --> 00:40:48,227
and none of it is going to end up with a common vision.

642
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,301
Make good trailers, that's a pretty good one.

643
00:40:53,301 --> 00:40:59,803
And I think the biggest thing is, if you have multiple people working on a project, even

644
00:40:59,803 --> 00:41:04,425
if you're one of those people that really likes working with PR companies or whatever,

645
00:41:04,425 --> 00:41:10,047
make sure the people who informed and had the vision of the game are actually directly

646
00:41:10,047 --> 00:41:11,387
involved in promotion.

647
00:41:11,387 --> 00:41:18,390
It's so easy to promote your game correctly when someone who cares about it is talking

648
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:18,690
about it.

649
00:41:19,242 --> 00:41:24,886
And I think we all know that there's a lot of gamers out there who care about who makes

650
00:41:24,886 --> 00:41:26,427
their games.

651
00:41:26,427 --> 00:41:29,489
And you can make that a part of how you talk about your game.

652
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:33,652
You can tell that story of your game by, you know, being the person who cares the most

653
00:41:33,652 --> 00:41:36,914
about the game and being in front of people.

654
00:41:36,914 --> 00:41:40,137
So here's some direct sorcery examples of how we did that.

655
00:41:40,137 --> 00:41:42,818
Chris and Craig wrote all the promotional text for everything we did.

656
00:41:42,818 --> 00:41:48,322
Craig always gave a final pass to all the text to make sure that it sounded like sorcery.

657
00:41:48,908 --> 00:41:53,310
Every single solitary thing we did had to share the sorcery tone.

658
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,870
It had to have some mysterious elements.

659
00:41:55,870 --> 00:42:00,291
It had to have a couple of tongue-in-cheek jokes while still kind of being serious.

660
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:04,172
It always had to have music at the forefront.

661
00:42:04,172 --> 00:42:10,134
Even if it wasn't even video, there were often times that we were thinking about what music would fit what we were talking about,

662
00:42:10,134 --> 00:42:12,714
even though we were just making promotional still art.

663
00:42:14,988 --> 00:42:20,690
There's also kind of amazing things that can happen through giving voices to characters

664
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:25,572
when you can't even do voice, like I talked about with Clive, but also just, you know,

665
00:42:25,572 --> 00:42:29,353
the way that you think about the characters and how you're able to, you know, write text

666
00:42:29,353 --> 00:42:32,014
thinking about how they sound.

667
00:42:32,014 --> 00:42:36,896
In the case of sorcery, a lot of the promotional art added characters to the world even though

668
00:42:36,896 --> 00:42:38,317
they weren't in the game.

669
00:42:38,317 --> 00:42:42,518
So there's a lot of like weird doctors and children and knights and...

670
00:42:42,979 --> 00:42:46,160
horses and monsters in the promotional artwork,

671
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,681
none of which appear in the game, but all of which seem to help build out the

672
00:42:49,681 --> 00:42:52,382
vision of what Sorcery was.

673
00:42:52,382 --> 00:42:54,082
So even shit like putting out

674
00:42:54,082 --> 00:42:56,043
sales on the solstices.

675
00:42:56,043 --> 00:42:58,764
So the only time that Sorcery goes on sale is during

676
00:42:58,764 --> 00:43:03,365
each solstice. Spring solstice, winter solstice, all of that.

677
00:43:03,365 --> 00:43:06,306
Even when we time sales is based on the vision for the game.

678
00:43:06,306 --> 00:43:09,407
The soundtrack releases itself was a big component.

679
00:43:09,827 --> 00:43:15,472
of the vision of the game. From the very beginning, one of the pieces of the vision was to get

680
00:43:15,472 --> 00:43:22,557
Jim's music out there specifically on vinyl. And so doing that was like a key part of promoting

681
00:43:22,557 --> 00:43:26,000
the game while maintaining that kind of like really intense vision.

682
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:32,705
So let's go to the next slide here. There we go. So in conclusion, take some risks,

683
00:43:32,705 --> 00:43:38,490
collaborate to make your project better.

684
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:44,992
Keep calm in the face of insurmountable odds, and think of promotion as an extension of

685
00:43:44,992 --> 00:43:52,455
your vision. Super easy. Just, you know, no problem.

686
00:43:52,455 --> 00:43:58,878
So for me, traditionally independent developers are known for making unique and risky games,

687
00:43:58,878 --> 00:44:03,259
and this is kind of like my, this isn't actually the real conclusion, this is just like a kind

688
00:44:03,259 --> 00:44:05,600
of a plea to people.

689
00:44:07,168 --> 00:44:11,110
So normally the people in this room are making the most interesting, unique, risky games,

690
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:16,273
and a lot of you seem like you're going to be making stuff on iOS. So please make risky

691
00:44:16,273 --> 00:44:21,475
stuff on iOS. We all want to play it. We all want to play the stuff that you guys are going

692
00:44:21,475 --> 00:44:27,538
to make on a platform that doesn't have that much of them on it. But just make sure the

693
00:44:27,538 --> 00:44:30,060
game's awesome. Thank you.

694
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:46,377
Do people want to ask questions and stuff?

695
00:44:46,377 --> 00:44:47,377
Some people want to ask?

696
00:44:47,377 --> 00:44:47,637
Okay, yeah.

697
00:44:47,637 --> 00:44:47,737
Cool.

698
00:44:47,737 --> 00:44:49,698
You talk about collaboration a lot.

699
00:44:49,698 --> 00:44:54,440
Do you ever, during the process, did you ever have a problem with team members trying to

700
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:58,361
pull the vision or the game in different directions from each other?

701
00:44:58,361 --> 00:45:04,903
Well, I think that, well, in the case of Sword and Sorcery, the entire, like, the whole thing

702
00:45:04,903 --> 00:45:06,904
started based on a vision.

703
00:45:07,595 --> 00:45:12,436
like it was always kind of about then on this one kind of overarching idea

704
00:45:12,436 --> 00:45:13,596
and uh...

705
00:45:13,596 --> 00:45:16,577
i think that the fact that like chris

706
00:45:16,577 --> 00:45:17,177
craig

707
00:45:17,177 --> 00:45:20,578
bought into that from the very beginning

708
00:45:20,578 --> 00:45:24,479
uh... even when one of the three or two of the three wanted to go in a different

709
00:45:24,479 --> 00:45:25,019
direction

710
00:45:25,019 --> 00:45:28,460
there was always that chance to say just like we all know what this game is

711
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:29,980
supposed to be because we

712
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:31,500
we know what this is

713
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:36,001
i mean really for us it we never ended up in a scenario where people were

714
00:45:36,001 --> 00:45:36,902
trying to take the time

715
00:45:37,275 --> 00:45:41,336
probably the most obvious chance that we had to take the project in a different direction

716
00:45:41,336 --> 00:45:43,557
was when we were like, fuck, we gotta get it out really quick.

717
00:45:43,557 --> 00:45:48,919
And in that case, there was always somebody to bring us back to that point where it was

718
00:45:48,919 --> 00:45:53,460
like, nope, this is the vision of the game. And it did help a ton that the foundation

719
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:59,042
of the game was like, we already knew Craig's art, we already knew Jim's music, we already

720
00:45:59,042 --> 00:46:05,464
knew that Cappy could put games out and, you know, have had a really strong design sensibility.

721
00:46:05,464 --> 00:46:06,665
So we knew that...

722
00:46:06,893 --> 00:46:10,396
there were going to be problems, but everybody kind of knew coming in what they all added

723
00:46:10,396 --> 00:46:14,018
to the project. So, I don't know if that, I feel like that didn't answer your question

724
00:46:14,018 --> 00:46:15,319
at all, but, sorry.

725
00:46:15,319 --> 00:46:22,644
I'm wondering if you could say more about what exactly you mean by standing out. Maybe

726
00:46:22,644 --> 00:46:26,606
you just mean, be awesome.

727
00:46:26,606 --> 00:46:31,029
I mean, I think standing out is kind of this like byproduct of making a game that A, you

728
00:46:31,029 --> 00:46:33,611
care about, but B, isn't safe.

729
00:46:34,073 --> 00:46:41,337
I mean, I think the easiest way to stand out is to make something weird as shit, or make, like, make something that

730
00:46:41,337 --> 00:46:47,121
just basically flies right in the face of what everyone else is doing, as long as you care about doing that.

731
00:46:47,121 --> 00:46:51,924
I'm definitely not advocating that everybody should drop the project they love to make something that they think is weird.

732
00:46:51,924 --> 00:46:58,548
But I think that people should not be afraid of making those weird games, or not be, you know,

733
00:46:58,548 --> 00:47:02,651
embrace it and love it, and then talk about why it's weird.

734
00:47:03,192 --> 00:47:09,453
Don't try to hide the weirdness in making a really serious

735
00:47:09,453 --> 00:47:13,134
publisher-style trailer or putting out press releases with

736
00:47:13,134 --> 00:47:15,095
official company letterhead or whatever.

737
00:47:15,095 --> 00:47:18,836
Just own up to what you're making and talk about it the

738
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,496
way that you feel about it.

739
00:47:20,496 --> 00:47:22,917
And I think a lot of that does help with the standing out.

740
00:47:22,917 --> 00:47:28,178
But most of all, I think it's about thinking, OK, what do I

741
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,819
want to make?

742
00:47:29,819 --> 00:47:31,639
And how do I talk about it?

743
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:36,233
And a lot of games that aren't even that super strange,

744
00:47:36,233 --> 00:47:38,794
even ones that have a small strange component,

745
00:47:38,794 --> 00:47:41,435
that's the component that often excites the game developer,

746
00:47:41,435 --> 00:47:42,636
the person making it.

747
00:47:42,636 --> 00:47:44,857
And so not being afraid to talk about that piece of it,

748
00:47:44,857 --> 00:47:48,039
I think is really important when it comes to standing out.

749
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:54,622
You talked a lot about the PR as like a afterthought,

750
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:55,463
kind of, of the game.

751
00:47:55,463 --> 00:47:57,484
And I was wondering, one of the things I thought

752
00:47:57,484 --> 00:47:59,805
was really awesome about the game was the way that you

753
00:48:00,571 --> 00:48:05,034
the whole concept was kind of based almost around this kind of PR message or

754
00:48:05,034 --> 00:48:10,638
kind of like, it was almost like this ingenious marketing scheme. I don't know, like,

755
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:12,779
if you could talk about that a little bit?

756
00:48:12,779 --> 00:48:14,561
Do you mean like the Twitters?

757
00:48:14,561 --> 00:48:20,345
Right, like the Twitters stuff and also the whole idea of the real world events like

758
00:48:20,345 --> 00:48:21,405
the cycle of the moon.

759
00:48:21,405 --> 00:48:22,126
Yeah.

760
00:48:22,126 --> 00:48:25,608
Kind of organizing the fan base to be talking about it at certain times.

761
00:48:25,608 --> 00:48:26,589
Yeah, I mean...

762
00:48:27,959 --> 00:48:33,522
It's hard to, like, you know, Cappy's been around for quite a while, so it's hard for

763
00:48:33,522 --> 00:48:38,664
us not to think about promoting stuff, even when we're making it. But all of the decisions

764
00:48:38,664 --> 00:48:44,527
made in developing the game were made because we thought it was better for the game, not

765
00:48:44,527 --> 00:48:48,369
because we thought it would be good PR. Like, the entire Twitter component of the game was

766
00:48:48,369 --> 00:48:53,332
never conceived to be a PR or marketing component. I mean, you know, everybody knew that it might

767
00:48:53,332 --> 00:48:54,652
have this fringe benefit of doing it.

768
00:48:55,042 --> 00:48:57,743
but, you know, the core behind the Twitter integration,

769
00:48:57,743 --> 00:49:00,404
or the core behind the moon phases was because,

770
00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:03,085
you know, we thought it was a really awesome piece

771
00:49:03,085 --> 00:49:05,066
of the design puzzle that was Sorcery,

772
00:49:05,066 --> 00:49:06,946
or the vision puzzle that was Sorcery.

773
00:49:06,946 --> 00:49:08,507
I mean, I think, like, you know,

774
00:49:08,507 --> 00:49:10,588
anybody who's making games nowadays

775
00:49:10,588 --> 00:49:12,268
thinks about, like,

776
00:49:12,268 --> 00:49:14,509
if the plan is to commercially release it,

777
00:49:14,509 --> 00:49:15,670
pretty much everybody's thinking about

778
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:17,110
how they're gonna commercially release it

779
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:18,010
even while they're making it.

780
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:20,251
And so that does kind of inform the decisions,

781
00:49:20,251 --> 00:49:22,112
but I don't think at any time

782
00:49:22,112 --> 00:49:24,253
during the development of Sorcery,

783
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:24,693
we were like,

784
00:49:25,148 --> 00:49:28,912
We really want to do this thing, but it'd be way better for promotion if we did that thing.

785
00:49:28,912 --> 00:49:34,977
And I honestly think that that's part of, like, you know, making something that's easy to promote.

786
00:49:34,977 --> 00:49:40,102
You know, people smell marketing ideas from a mile away these days.

787
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:44,866
You know, people are a lot smarter than I think, you know, a lot of us give them credit for,

788
00:49:44,866 --> 00:49:49,430
and they know when something is done from the heart and something is done

789
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:51,332
just because you think it'll sell 20,000 more copies.

790
00:49:52,113 --> 00:49:54,535
So yeah, I do, like, we definitely thought a lot about promotion.

791
00:49:54,535 --> 00:49:59,537
We talked a lot about trailers before we were anywhere close to being finished,

792
00:49:59,537 --> 00:50:03,579
just because we were really excited about the vision of the game,

793
00:50:03,579 --> 00:50:07,441
and because we knew that we could make something cool in trailer format,

794
00:50:07,441 --> 00:50:09,742
or in, like, we knew Craig could make really rad promotional art.

795
00:50:09,742 --> 00:50:10,002
So, yeah.

796
00:50:10,002 --> 00:50:12,223
Let's go over, bounce over there.

797
00:50:15,992 --> 00:50:21,013
So, whatever any small studio embarks on an entrepreneurial venture, it's always a,

798
00:50:21,013 --> 00:50:26,095
ah, okay, let's just push this folder down the hill and pick up the moss and the experiences.

799
00:50:26,095 --> 00:50:30,316
We go, we just have to take what we get.

800
00:50:30,316 --> 00:50:34,617
Invariably, you'll have a world of things that you didn't know that you didn't know.

801
00:50:34,617 --> 00:50:39,559
What did you learn from this process that you didn't know when you started,

802
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:44,100
which you would embark to people pursuing this?

803
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,501
Good question, yeah.

804
00:50:45,811 --> 00:50:53,775
like that. I definitely think that, well, I'll speak for Cappy specifically. We spent

805
00:50:53,775 --> 00:50:58,297
a lot of time making, like, we spent a bunch of time doing contract work. We spent a while

806
00:50:58,297 --> 00:51:05,200
after that working with some publishers. And we made some decisions that were based on,

807
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:09,222
oh, this is a smart business move. Like, this is the right business call. We'll, you know,

808
00:51:09,222 --> 00:51:13,444
we made Critter Crunch and Clash of Heroes, so we should make another puzzle-style game.

809
00:51:13,444 --> 00:51:15,505
Because that's, you know, someone's going to fund it. It's a perfect idea.

810
00:51:16,142 --> 00:51:20,785
And this project, I mean, this is something that we had talked about a bunch in the studio

811
00:51:20,785 --> 00:51:25,208
before, but this project really solidified the belief that any business call that you

812
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:29,211
make because it's a safe business call is actually the least safe business call of all

813
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:29,451
time.

814
00:51:29,451 --> 00:51:32,253
Those are the inherent risks.

815
00:51:32,253 --> 00:51:34,954
Those are the ones that you get fucked by contracts.

816
00:51:34,954 --> 00:51:38,737
Those are the ones that you get screwed into putting some, or you screw yourself into putting

817
00:51:38,737 --> 00:51:41,379
something out that you don't care about, and then you can't actually promote it because

818
00:51:41,379 --> 00:51:43,640
everybody knows that you're just talking about something you don't care about.

819
00:51:44,369 --> 00:51:48,710
So definitely, I think that going into it knowing that

820
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:51,391
doing the thing that matters the most is probably the best

821
00:51:51,391 --> 00:51:54,612
business call you can make was a really important learning.

822
00:51:54,612 --> 00:52:01,053
And I think another one is really, I've worked with the

823
00:52:01,053 --> 00:52:04,794
people at Cappy, the founders of Cappy, for a really long

824
00:52:04,794 --> 00:52:07,375
time, and I know when to trust them.

825
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:09,775
I know when they make a call that it's the right call.

826
00:52:09,775 --> 00:52:13,076
When you bring people in, like

827
00:52:13,409 --> 00:52:18,053
you know, I knew Craig and I kind of knew Jim when we started.

828
00:52:18,053 --> 00:52:22,236
It's really hard to like, let them into that same trust level

829
00:52:22,236 --> 00:52:24,398
as people that you've known, like for in the case of like,

830
00:52:24,398 --> 00:52:28,981
Chris, like 13 years. So I think one of the other thing that I

831
00:52:28,981 --> 00:52:32,244
learned is that the sooner or the faster that we try to go

832
00:52:32,244 --> 00:52:37,168
like, you know, went out for a few beers, or a lot of beers,

833
00:52:37,168 --> 00:52:40,751
and had no just time to like talk about talk together about

834
00:52:40,751 --> 00:52:42,532
the project and the endeavor we were going on.

835
00:52:42,738 --> 00:52:45,080
the sooner we were able to just skip over that whole, like,

836
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,961
I don't know if I trust this guy.

837
00:52:46,961 --> 00:52:49,723
I mean, we obviously trusted him right away

838
00:52:49,723 --> 00:52:52,646
because we set out to make the game right away,

839
00:52:52,646 --> 00:52:54,867
but it kind of helped get us over that hump

840
00:52:54,867 --> 00:52:56,208
when Craig would fight for something

841
00:52:56,208 --> 00:52:57,589
or Jim would fight for something,

842
00:52:57,589 --> 00:52:59,251
and I knew it was gonna push the schedule

843
00:52:59,251 --> 00:53:01,212
or we knew it was gonna add more money.

844
00:53:01,212 --> 00:53:02,513
You could just kind of say,

845
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:09,839
okay, I know what he's talking about and I trust that.

846
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:11,480
Fight, fight.

847
00:53:12,785 --> 00:53:13,305
Okay, go.

848
00:53:13,305 --> 00:53:16,966
man in audience, PC version, question mark.

849
00:53:16,966 --> 00:53:18,067
Um, no comment, question mark.

850
00:53:18,067 --> 00:53:30,492
Um, speaking of PR, I was wondering, um, you didn't mention one thing that I, I found to

851
00:53:30,492 --> 00:53:35,074
be incredibly important, and that's a product demo, like a, a playable product demo. Because

852
00:53:35,074 --> 00:53:41,156
when, um, we've been promoting our games, you know, we, we've been putting, you know,

853
00:53:41,513 --> 00:53:47,675
There's a trailer for Resetir up and it's up on game trailers. I know it's already lost

854
00:53:47,675 --> 00:53:55,397
in the sea of trailers and nobody actually cares. But when we put out the demo for Resetir

855
00:53:55,397 --> 00:54:04,619
back in July of 2010, our servers literally began belching fire and people were begging

856
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:05,660
Steam to pick us up.

857
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:06,140
For sure.

858
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:07,940
And I'm wondering if...

859
00:54:09,063 --> 00:54:16,508
is it different on iOS? Like, you know, do demos get lost the same way full games get

860
00:54:16,508 --> 00:54:19,270
lost due to the way the App Store works?

861
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:23,613
Devils don't really exist, really, on the App Store. I mean, they kind of, like, you

862
00:54:23,613 --> 00:54:28,217
can kind of maybe do that. I don't really know the exact logistics, but you can't call

863
00:54:28,217 --> 00:54:33,441
anything a demo. You can have, like, a lite version or some shit like that. But, so maybe

864
00:54:33,441 --> 00:54:35,642
it's just semantics and you can demo what you want.

865
00:54:36,613 --> 00:54:47,018
I do think that we put sorcery in people's hands early, not even knowing that it was

866
00:54:47,018 --> 00:54:53,701
going to be that early. After two months of making a small little prototype, we basically

867
00:54:53,701 --> 00:54:57,483
put it in people's hands. And then we went quiet for a really long period of time when

868
00:54:57,483 --> 00:55:01,565
we weren't ready to sell the game or even talk about the game.

869
00:55:02,323 --> 00:55:05,064
But then when we were ready to show it again,

870
00:55:05,064 --> 00:55:07,005
we did go and put it in people's hands.

871
00:55:07,005 --> 00:55:08,786
And we never really shied away

872
00:55:08,786 --> 00:55:12,507
from letting anybody interested play it,

873
00:55:12,507 --> 00:55:14,929
press, or whatever.

874
00:55:14,929 --> 00:55:17,510
But yeah, I do think it's a little, like, it's...

875
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:19,571
I don't think that you can do on iOS

876
00:55:19,571 --> 00:55:22,072
what you can do on Steam when it comes to that style

877
00:55:22,072 --> 00:55:24,253
of, like, getting it out there.

878
00:55:24,253 --> 00:55:26,934
That style of, you know, selling it through a demo?

879
00:55:26,934 --> 00:55:30,335
Yeah, basically, like, let people try it first

880
00:55:30,335 --> 00:55:31,816
and then decide if they want to...

881
00:55:32,675 --> 00:55:38,538
I mean, there are ways you could probably do it on iOS,

882
00:55:38,538 --> 00:55:42,159
but I don't think that it's built into the consumer's

883
00:55:42,159 --> 00:55:43,880
mindset to do things that way.

884
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:44,880
I was just saying hi to Mike.

885
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,982
That powerful, cohesive vision that you talk about that

886
00:55:48,982 --> 00:55:54,404
informs the PR, is that something that you had

887
00:55:54,404 --> 00:56:00,526
crystallized from the start of the project, or was something

888
00:56:00,526 --> 00:56:02,127
that continued to?

889
00:56:02,682 --> 00:56:05,264
coagulate and form up until the moment of release?

890
00:56:05,264 --> 00:56:08,305
Well there was, I mean there were core components of it

891
00:56:08,305 --> 00:56:11,847
that basically like, you know, spread out into more ideas

892
00:56:11,847 --> 00:56:15,709
but there was that kind of like, you know, make a game with Soul

893
00:56:15,709 --> 00:56:21,152
a record you could hang out in, really about Craig's visual style

894
00:56:21,152 --> 00:56:24,133
and really about like,

895
00:56:24,133 --> 00:56:28,675
you know, really about when you play the game it's not about

896
00:56:28,675 --> 00:56:31,017
you know, pressure or whatever, it's just this

897
00:56:31,583 --> 00:56:36,146
you know, experience that you're, you know, chilling out in Jim's music, looking at Craig's

898
00:56:36,146 --> 00:56:38,827
art, and then having that kind of flowing experience.

899
00:56:38,827 --> 00:56:43,671
But then from there, like, a ton of different stuff spreaded out of it, but any time that

900
00:56:43,671 --> 00:56:48,494
stuff would spread out, it would kind of always come back to, does that fit into this, like,

901
00:56:48,494 --> 00:56:53,777
the guts of it all. And I think that that, I mean, for us, like, the people on the project

902
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:57,760
just kind of did that. I mean, that's not something that we had to kind of set out or,

903
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:58,900
like, mandate, like.

904
00:56:59,304 --> 00:57:05,510
every idea, do you give it the original SorceryVision stamp of approval. It just kind of like, it

905
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:11,235
existed and people understood it. And I think that's how, like, when we talk about collaboration,

906
00:57:11,235 --> 00:57:17,161
it was such a great experience because, you know, Chris and Craig and Jim just, they just

907
00:57:17,161 --> 00:57:22,766
got it. They didn't really have to spend a lot of time. I mean, most of the time that

908
00:57:22,766 --> 00:57:25,308
there was disagreements, it was kind of like...

909
00:57:26,132 --> 00:57:33,056
how central to the sorcery vision is it, rather than, like, I really want to do this thing,

910
00:57:33,056 --> 00:57:35,058
like, a mile away, and that's, it's, it's that or break.

911
00:57:35,058 --> 00:57:35,598
Thank you.

912
00:57:35,598 --> 00:57:39,140
Hey. So, I heard about your talk at IndieCade, which I think was similar to this one.

913
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:44,243
Yeah, there was, like, the first couple of slides was similar.

914
00:57:44,243 --> 00:57:48,546
Yeah. Well, anyway, I, I heard, like, a gist of, part of it was, like, don't try to make

915
00:57:48,546 --> 00:57:52,388
Angry Birds, because it's a lottery and you're not going to win. And it kind of, like,

916
00:57:53,382 --> 00:57:55,904
and do something for the 10%, which I totally think is cool.

917
00:57:55,904 --> 00:57:59,206
But I've also can't count the number of times

918
00:57:59,206 --> 00:58:01,628
that I've said in a meeting, or someone else

919
00:58:01,628 --> 00:58:04,469
has said in a meeting recently on my new two projects,

920
00:58:04,469 --> 00:58:06,811
that, well, Angry Birds didn't like this,

921
00:58:06,811 --> 00:58:09,553
or Cut the Rope is like this, and we

922
00:58:09,553 --> 00:58:11,614
should do something like that.

923
00:58:11,614 --> 00:58:13,855
And it's kind of like, do you think

924
00:58:13,855 --> 00:58:15,757
that it's wrong to try to make something

925
00:58:15,757 --> 00:58:18,839
with a super broad appeal because the game will suffer,

926
00:58:18,839 --> 00:58:20,640
or because you actually think that?

927
00:58:21,341 --> 00:58:24,484
a game like Angry Birds released at the same time as Angry Birds

928
00:58:24,484 --> 00:58:28,227
will make zero money compared just because it is a lottery or

929
00:58:28,227 --> 00:58:32,290
I feel like capturing 10% of Angry Birds or 5% of Angry Birds

930
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:35,673
will pay for me for 10 years so.

931
00:58:35,673 --> 00:58:39,616
It'll pay for everyone in this room for 10 years. I'm okay with only picking up

932
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:43,539
like a tiny percentage of what Angry Birds will do but I think like a broad based appeal game

933
00:58:44,072 --> 00:58:45,712
like that's what I'm working on. I don't know.

934
00:58:45,712 --> 00:58:52,295
Well, I definitely don't want to like make it sound like I don't think people should make a game that has broad appeal.

935
00:58:52,295 --> 00:58:56,057
I think that you should know what you're making going into it, right?

936
00:58:56,057 --> 00:59:02,700
Like you know that you're competing against a much huger number of people, of developers,

937
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:09,343
many of whom have like EA to pull the sales switch, meaning that they can ruin the entire app store for a week

938
00:59:09,343 --> 00:59:12,024
by putting all their games on sale when they launch a game.

939
00:59:12,577 --> 00:59:15,938
that happened to us during sorcery and had no effect on it.

940
00:59:15,938 --> 00:59:19,300
And I think that that was because it was, you know, in a different side.

941
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:24,903
But I think when it comes down to, and I was really weary about parts of this talk,

942
00:59:24,903 --> 00:59:27,244
because it does make it sound like I'm like,

943
00:59:27,244 --> 00:59:30,546
no, don't do it the way that you want to do it, do it this way, this is the right way.

944
00:59:30,546 --> 00:59:31,906
And I don't think that's the case.

945
00:59:31,906 --> 00:59:33,607
But I think that, like, I think it's actually,

946
00:59:33,607 --> 00:59:39,490
you're actually incapable of making a game that has the same approach as Angry Birds.

947
00:59:40,284 --> 00:59:45,925
you're automatically going to have a design perspective, a creative perspective, an aesthetic perspective

948
00:59:45,925 --> 00:59:47,506
that puts it in a different class.

949
00:59:47,506 --> 00:59:51,027
That's where I worry, like are you saying, like, I'm trying to be something that I'm not?

950
00:59:51,027 --> 00:59:51,067
No.

951
00:59:51,067 --> 00:59:53,507
And therefore I'm going to make a game that's not...

952
00:59:53,507 --> 00:59:55,748
Like, if I'm trying to be like Angry Birds, then I'm not going to...

953
00:59:55,748 --> 00:59:57,669
it's going to be like half and half and not as good.

954
00:59:57,669 --> 01:00:02,270
No, no, no. I think it's more like the components of, like,

955
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:05,451
you can make an Angry... well, don't make an Angry Birds clone.

956
01:00:05,451 --> 01:00:09,632
But like, you can make a game that fits the exact same mentalities.

957
01:00:09,959 --> 01:00:13,961
the exact same kind of like sensibilities, the exact same goals,

958
01:00:13,961 --> 01:00:17,543
but if you do it like the way that you're passionate about, and if you do it

959
01:00:17,543 --> 01:00:21,225
you have like a vision for the game.

960
01:00:21,225 --> 01:00:22,346
You know, like Gasketball.

961
01:00:22,346 --> 01:00:26,988
Like, when I look at that, I'm not, I don't think, I think that that's a game

962
01:00:26,988 --> 01:00:29,069
that could reach a mass market,

963
01:00:29,069 --> 01:00:31,951
but I don't think that its goal is to

964
01:00:31,951 --> 01:00:33,231
compete with Angry Birds.

965
01:00:33,231 --> 01:00:35,493
I think it's being made by,

966
01:00:35,493 --> 01:00:38,154
you know, it's a really interesting, unique game.

967
01:00:38,544 --> 01:00:42,847
even though the target audience might be wider than sorcery.

968
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:46,110
So I think kind of like, hopefully the message that

969
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:48,332
doesn't get lost is that, like,

970
01:00:48,332 --> 01:00:49,533
even though you're...

971
01:00:49,533 --> 01:00:52,415
To me, playing the lottery is starting a game

972
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:53,856
to try to make Angry Birds.

973
01:00:53,856 --> 01:00:54,316
Sure.

974
01:00:54,316 --> 01:00:55,737
To try to hit Angry Birds success.

975
01:00:55,737 --> 01:00:58,700
Like saying like, oh shit, I got three months,

976
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:01,222
I can make, I can make Cut the Rope.

977
01:01:01,222 --> 01:01:01,462
Here I go.

978
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:08,012
If you start the project with that in mind, I think that's when you're actually directly

979
01:01:08,012 --> 01:01:11,814
competing with everyone else outside of this room at this conference, because they're all

980
01:01:11,814 --> 01:01:13,635
seeing the dollar signs flashing in their face.

981
01:01:13,635 --> 01:01:18,558
But if you're starting out saying, I got this great idea for a game, I really think that

982
01:01:18,558 --> 01:01:22,460
this is like an awesome idea, I can really like, you know, I can make something rad out

983
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:26,802
of this, and it just so happens that it's also in the kind of more mass markets, I think

984
01:01:26,802 --> 01:01:28,342
I don't think you're in the same space.

985
01:01:28,342 --> 01:01:31,684
I don't think you're setting yourself up to try to like, you know, I'm going to sell this

986
01:01:31,684 --> 01:01:32,725
game to everyone.

987
01:01:33,338 --> 01:01:34,819
that's not the way you're approaching it.

988
01:01:34,819 --> 01:01:37,081
It might be more mainstream, but it...

989
01:01:37,081 --> 01:01:38,482
I'm going to air quote mainstream,

990
01:01:38,482 --> 01:01:40,103
because I don't even know if that's the case.

991
01:01:40,103 --> 01:01:41,964
But it might be more mass market focused

992
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:44,646
than, say, something targeting a nichey niche.

993
01:01:44,646 --> 01:01:45,827
But that doesn't necessarily mean

994
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:47,268
that you're just pulling that lottery.

995
01:01:47,268 --> 01:01:48,268
You know what you're getting into,

996
01:01:48,268 --> 01:01:49,609
and you know the game that you're making.

997
01:01:49,609 --> 01:01:51,771
Whereas, you're not just making money

998
01:01:51,771 --> 01:01:53,832
and wrapping a game around it.

999
01:01:53,832 --> 01:01:55,793
Or trying to make money and wrap a game around it.

1000
01:01:55,793 --> 01:01:55,974
Cool.

1001
01:01:55,974 --> 01:01:56,974
I'm done. All right.

1002
01:01:56,974 --> 01:01:59,376
Sorry, guy over there.
