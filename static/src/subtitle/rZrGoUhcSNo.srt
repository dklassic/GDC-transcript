00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:14,771
Hi everybody. I'm Jason Roberts. I think I'm supposed to tell you to silence your devices,

2
00:00:14,771 --> 00:00:25,477
please. My talk is called Gorogoa, the design of a cosmic acrostic. So who am I? I'm a

3
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:33,343
I should say a bit about my pedigree, which is mostly non-existent, at least prior to

4
00:00:33,343 --> 00:00:34,604
this game.

5
00:00:34,604 --> 00:00:40,647
I was a software engineer up until 2012, making non-entertainment software.

6
00:00:40,647 --> 00:00:42,848
I was an artist in my spare time.

7
00:00:42,848 --> 00:00:48,031
I liked to draw, mostly as making gifts for my mom, that kind of thing.

8
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:56,435
I started a couple of parser-based text games in the 90s that I never finished.

9
00:00:56,435 --> 00:01:04,097
Apart from that, Gorgo is the first game I ever tried to make, and it released in December.

10
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:10,939
I don't want to spend a ton of time on this, but obvious question, why did it take so long?

11
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:17,621
It was in development for five-plus years, five years full-time.

12
00:01:18,217 --> 00:01:24,179
I think the short answer is that you can't skip the learning process when making games.

13
00:01:24,179 --> 00:01:32,283
The conventional wisdom is start with something simple, finish it, move on, do something slightly

14
00:01:32,283 --> 00:01:35,005
more ambitious, finish that and move on.

15
00:01:35,005 --> 00:01:40,387
And I think Gorgoa is not actually a counterexample to that.

16
00:01:40,387 --> 00:01:43,909
I think that inexperience added years to the project.

17
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:47,431
I ended up throwing out a lot of prematurely polished work.

18
00:01:48,302 --> 00:01:54,064
And I may even have learned more slowly because I think some lessons you can only learn by

19
00:01:54,064 --> 00:01:59,687
finishing something and letting go of the protective delusions that allow you to get

20
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:00,608
through the project.

21
00:02:02,595 --> 00:02:08,797
I released a demo of the game back in 2012 that has been bouncing around the internet

22
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:10,137
ever since.

23
00:02:10,137 --> 00:02:12,478
And I sort of made it by instinct.

24
00:02:12,478 --> 00:02:19,120
I didn't read any game design books or even understand that I was supposed to be thinking

25
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,481
about design.

26
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:30,564
And it looks more like a complete vision than it really is, that early demo.

27
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,543
I wound up with scenes, a bunch of, you know, that seemed,

28
00:02:39,543 --> 00:02:41,944
I enjoyed making them, I enjoyed finishing art,

29
00:02:41,944 --> 00:02:44,366
but those scenes were not really motivated

30
00:02:44,366 --> 00:02:45,646
narratively or thematically.

31
00:02:45,646 --> 00:02:48,528
And people could, you know,

32
00:02:48,528 --> 00:02:51,429
people thought the demo was dreamlike,

33
00:02:51,429 --> 00:02:54,571
but that only gets you so far.

34
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:58,192
When it came time to extend the game to full length,

35
00:02:58,192 --> 00:02:59,773
I had to find a way to...

36
00:03:00,976 --> 00:03:08,265
build in more story structure and stronger thematic through lines.

37
00:03:08,265 --> 00:03:13,793
And, uh, so it's sort of like, I think an overall theme of this talk is about adapting

38
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:18,819
story and theme to mechanics and form, uh, even though maybe

39
00:03:19,744 --> 00:03:25,146
Ideally it should be the other way around in the sense that you should know what story

40
00:03:25,146 --> 00:03:29,808
you want to tell and then decide which mechanics express that story.

41
00:03:29,808 --> 00:03:38,552
In practice I think it often goes the other way and that the process of discovering what

42
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:43,694
sort of story to tell, what sort of themes to address was both conscious and unconscious.

43
00:03:43,694 --> 00:03:49,496
Back to the very early hazy origins of the game.

44
00:03:49,957 --> 00:03:58,064
I don't remember the sequence of events exactly, but I know that I was trying to write a comic

45
00:03:58,064 --> 00:03:59,745
at one point.

46
00:03:59,745 --> 00:04:05,190
A few years before I started Gorgoa, I stalled about ten pages in.

47
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:12,056
The story already had problems, and those problems were sort of baked into art I'd already

48
00:04:12,056 --> 00:04:14,278
done and finished pages.

49
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:22,129
And it was just too daunting a prospect to go back and redo those pages, which there's

50
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:24,694
a lesson in that.

51
00:04:28,358 --> 00:04:34,062
I came to realize that it was composing the page that interested me more than telling

52
00:04:34,062 --> 00:04:35,703
a sequential story.

53
00:04:35,703 --> 00:04:43,049
This patchwork or mosaic of framed scenes is what I found compelling.

54
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:50,394
And I had to do something with it, even if it wasn't going to be a comic.

55
00:04:50,394 --> 00:04:53,356
And so why, what is compelling about it?

56
00:04:53,356 --> 00:04:56,519
I'm going to try and dig into that and explain it.

57
00:04:57,348 --> 00:05:02,169
starting with this basic building block, which is a single framed image.

58
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:06,250
The fundamental building block of Gorgoa.

59
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:15,052
We I think, everything that we, with the exception of virtual reality, everything we consume,

60
00:05:15,052 --> 00:05:16,472
all this media is inside a frame.

61
00:05:16,472 --> 00:05:22,413
Whether it's the edge of the TV, the edge of the phone, edge of the movie screen.

62
00:05:22,413 --> 00:05:23,133
But we're

63
00:05:24,245 --> 00:05:27,067
We've learned to try and forget that the frame is there.

64
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:28,989
That's what we mean by immersion.

65
00:05:28,989 --> 00:05:30,330
You forget the room you're in,

66
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,852
you forget the world you're in, yourself.

67
00:05:32,852 --> 00:05:35,234
You kind of mentally project yourself

68
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,636
through the screen into the world on the other side

69
00:05:37,636 --> 00:05:42,160
as sort of like virtual reality by sheer willpower.

70
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,163
But there's space outside the frame

71
00:05:46,163 --> 00:05:50,387
and I think that's fertile territory for design,

72
00:05:50,387 --> 00:05:52,408
as strange as that might sound.

73
00:05:54,460 --> 00:06:01,704
And I think by working on a comic, you can't ignore the frame,

74
00:06:01,704 --> 00:06:06,126
because your mind doesn't disappear inside any one frame for very long.

75
00:06:06,126 --> 00:06:11,349
You have to pull all your consciousness back out and move on to the next frame.

76
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:14,050
So the frames become visible.

77
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,593
That's what got my attention, that's what got me started down this design path.

78
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:22,820
So Gorgoa starts with a single frame

79
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,720
and a big white empty space.

80
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,260
And I think when you do that,

81
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:30,001
the decision to leave empty space is clearly intentional.

82
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:34,562
And you can tell that somebody made the frame visible

83
00:06:34,562 --> 00:06:35,303
for a reason.

84
00:06:35,303 --> 00:06:38,443
The frame itself is part of the message.

85
00:06:38,443 --> 00:06:40,524
But what is that message?

86
00:06:40,524 --> 00:06:44,205
And I'm gonna look at what are the inherent properties

87
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:46,505
or what do I feel are the inherent properties

88
00:06:46,505 --> 00:06:49,586
of the frame as an abstract concept?

89
00:06:52,113 --> 00:06:55,916
Well, first, I think the frame, it's subtle,

90
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,778
but I think it has a poignancy to it.

91
00:06:58,778 --> 00:07:01,760
If you imagine sitting in a room looking out the window,

92
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,803
whatever you see out there, you can't really be a part of it.

93
00:07:05,803 --> 00:07:07,444
You can't reach it.

94
00:07:07,444 --> 00:07:08,685
You can't touch it.

95
00:07:08,685 --> 00:07:12,448
All you can do is send your mind out through the window.

96
00:07:12,448 --> 00:07:16,531
And that has sort of a very sweet human sadness to it,

97
00:07:16,531 --> 00:07:16,811
I think.

98
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,453
And some of that sadness is present

99
00:07:19,453 --> 00:07:21,915
when you're playing a game or watching a movie also.

100
00:07:23,062 --> 00:07:27,004
And as you shrink the frame down and make the space outside of it larger, then that

101
00:07:27,004 --> 00:07:32,428
separation becomes, that we normally try to forget, becomes more clear.

102
00:07:32,428 --> 00:07:37,651
And I think that creates a more wistful and sort of oblique relationship to whatever is

103
00:07:37,651 --> 00:07:38,091
inside.

104
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:42,894
Also, a frame is a clue.

105
00:07:42,894 --> 00:07:47,918
If I put a frame around something, I'm clearly trying to say something.

106
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:49,679
I'm sending a message.

107
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:50,939
It's guiding you to something.

108
00:07:52,565 --> 00:07:57,687
and shrinking the focus concentrates significance.

109
00:07:57,687 --> 00:08:02,189
A frame represents curation.

110
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:03,890
It isn't neutral.

111
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:07,111
It cares about what it contains.

112
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:10,733
It's making a choice about what to include

113
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:11,613
and what to exclude,

114
00:08:11,613 --> 00:08:14,615
and it's excluding almost everything.

115
00:08:18,412 --> 00:08:20,772
A frame is an act of affection.

116
00:08:20,772 --> 00:08:24,114
You see things inside a frame often

117
00:08:24,114 --> 00:08:25,894
because they're precious.

118
00:08:25,894 --> 00:08:28,455
It's like a little jewel, like a box you built

119
00:08:28,455 --> 00:08:31,156
for something that you care about deeply,

120
00:08:31,156 --> 00:08:32,096
or like a halo.

121
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:38,238
Frame is mysterious.

122
00:08:38,238 --> 00:08:40,939
Because you can see the space outside the frame,

123
00:08:40,939 --> 00:08:43,460
your attention is drawn to the limits of what you can see.

124
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,361
And I think that naturally makes you wonder

125
00:08:45,361 --> 00:08:47,202
what's beyond that boundary.

126
00:08:51,786 --> 00:08:56,667
And also a frame is like a prison.

127
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:59,468
It's a box or a fence around whatever's inside.

128
00:08:59,468 --> 00:09:04,629
And I think that creates an unconscious tension,

129
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:08,409
at least it does for me, because if you see a prison,

130
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:11,290
you wanna see an escape.

131
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,811
On some level, you wanna see the frame broken

132
00:09:13,811 --> 00:09:15,111
or transcended.

133
00:09:15,111 --> 00:09:21,332
So frames, at least in my mind, the way I think of it,

134
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,521
have all these qualities inherently.

135
00:09:24,521 --> 00:09:26,622
And so the question becomes, you know,

136
00:09:26,622 --> 00:09:31,143
how to tell a story that speaks to these properties,

137
00:09:31,143 --> 00:09:35,744
that resonates with these inherent qualities.

138
00:09:35,744 --> 00:09:39,225
And once we add interactivity,

139
00:09:39,225 --> 00:09:42,346
and you know, interactivity in Gorgo is very simple.

140
00:09:42,346 --> 00:09:45,467
You can just zoom in on parts of a scene,

141
00:09:45,467 --> 00:09:48,328
but by zooming in, you're transferring

142
00:09:48,328 --> 00:09:50,868
all the properties of the frame to whatever you zoom in on.

143
00:09:51,516 --> 00:09:56,437
So you are making it a clue, you are lending it mystery,

144
00:09:56,437 --> 00:09:59,939
you are imprisoning it, et cetera.

145
00:09:59,939 --> 00:10:04,680
And so looking around in Gorgoa in this format

146
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,581
is a very forceful act.

147
00:10:06,581 --> 00:10:11,602
Now once you start putting together multiple frames,

148
00:10:11,602 --> 00:10:15,283
so sort of inching back towards the comic page,

149
00:10:17,238 --> 00:10:20,800
It's sort of like you're now putting together a whole gallery exhibition,

150
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,502
multiple pictures on a wall.

151
00:10:23,502 --> 00:10:27,044
And whenever you put multiple pictures together,

152
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:29,766
it's sort of like a montage in cinema.

153
00:10:29,766 --> 00:10:34,949
Your brain fills up with heat lightning trying to make associations.

154
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:37,451
Why are these pictures together?

155
00:10:37,451 --> 00:10:40,933
And your inner conspiracy theorist just starts

156
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:43,455
connecting red strings back and forth.

157
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:49,060
And if you have multiple interactive frames,

158
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,741
then every time you interact with a frame

159
00:10:51,741 --> 00:10:53,561
to change what's inside of it,

160
00:10:53,561 --> 00:10:56,603
you're recurating that exhibition.

161
00:10:56,603 --> 00:10:58,643
And each one of those changes,

162
00:10:58,643 --> 00:11:00,464
if one of four panels changes,

163
00:11:00,464 --> 00:11:04,446
that sets off a whole new cascade of mental electricity

164
00:11:04,446 --> 00:11:07,367
as your brain, again, tries to figure out

165
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:08,407
how these things are connected.

166
00:11:09,331 --> 00:11:17,495
And that larger possibility of space of how the frames could be connected is sort

167
00:11:17,495 --> 00:11:20,397
of what led me away from sequential storytelling

168
00:11:20,397 --> 00:11:21,617
because that's only one axis of connection.

169
00:11:21,617 --> 00:11:27,420
And maybe this search for connections between images

170
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,102
or fragments will turn out to be a narrative theme.

171
00:11:33,614 --> 00:11:38,557
But the question remains, after everything I've said,

172
00:11:38,557 --> 00:11:39,637
how to make that into a game.

173
00:11:39,637 --> 00:11:41,679
I've got a set of panels.

174
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:43,600
I can interact with each panel.

175
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,701
And multiple panels, like I say, make

176
00:11:46,701 --> 00:11:48,382
the promise of connections.

177
00:11:48,382 --> 00:11:51,384
So we need them to interact with each other somehow.

178
00:11:51,384 --> 00:11:56,727
One of my early ideas was some sort of card game.

179
00:11:56,727 --> 00:12:01,049
Because once the comic panels are decoupled from the comic

180
00:12:01,049 --> 00:12:01,470
page.

181
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:04,971
they sort of look like cards, they're little rectangles.

182
00:12:04,971 --> 00:12:07,133
What if we can move them around,

183
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:09,495
stack them, play them on each other?

184
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:13,078
I don't have a mock-up of this, I never built it,

185
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:16,642
but if you can imagine a playing card

186
00:12:16,642 --> 00:12:18,363
having an interactive scene inside,

187
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,745
like one of the panels in Gorgoa,

188
00:12:20,745 --> 00:12:24,008
you enter that scene and by exploring it,

189
00:12:24,008 --> 00:12:25,169
solving puzzles inside,

190
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:26,510
you change the picture on the card.

191
00:12:27,115 --> 00:12:29,396
And thus you change the properties of the card.

192
00:12:29,396 --> 00:12:32,478
So maybe you can turn two of diamonds

193
00:12:32,478 --> 00:12:36,759
into five of hearts, something.

194
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:40,721
But that idea had some problems.

195
00:12:40,721 --> 00:12:42,882
First, I don't know about card games.

196
00:12:42,882 --> 00:12:46,243
I don't know how to make the rules interesting or fun.

197
00:12:47,003 --> 00:12:51,887
I don't know how to relate that top level card game that you're playing to theme or

198
00:12:51,887 --> 00:12:56,771
story and as soon as you make the scenes interactive then you're creating a world that feels like

199
00:12:56,771 --> 00:12:57,652
it should have some narrative.

200
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:03,096
And besides, because you're changing the properties of the cards, you're cheating at whatever

201
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:06,939
the game is and that makes the whole thing pointless.

202
00:13:06,939 --> 00:13:13,184
So how about something more like a card trick, something that feels like magic.

203
00:13:13,184 --> 00:13:14,726
I want to keep...

204
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:19,012
I like the physicality of the cards and that's retained in the final game.

205
00:13:19,012 --> 00:13:23,555
This sort of like subtle things like drop shadow and the papery sounds when you pick

206
00:13:23,555 --> 00:13:30,299
things up and put them down because I think that that physicality makes it more magical

207
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:32,380
when they come to life and you can interact with them.

208
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:39,043
But the interactions between tiles should also feel magical and we don't need complex

209
00:13:39,043 --> 00:13:41,785
rules for this top level game.

210
00:13:42,913 --> 00:13:46,696
you don't need to know how to play cards to enjoy a card trick.

211
00:13:46,696 --> 00:13:53,360
At some point I

212
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,182
sort of, I guess I mixed in the DNA of

213
00:13:56,182 --> 00:13:58,563
a jigsaw puzzle. This is like what is

214
00:13:58,563 --> 00:14:01,745
the most literal way in which two scenes can connect. That's connect

215
00:14:01,745 --> 00:14:04,326
visually to form a single image.

216
00:14:04,326 --> 00:14:08,109
And jigsaw puzzles are simple but compelling.

217
00:14:08,872 --> 00:14:13,393
putting two pieces together, you know, that's exciting.

218
00:14:13,393 --> 00:14:17,695
It's like reuniting two halves of a torn photograph

219
00:14:17,695 --> 00:14:19,076
or something.

220
00:14:19,076 --> 00:14:22,957
And this idea satisfies the promise I was talking about

221
00:14:22,957 --> 00:14:26,799
earlier, resolve that tension that you wanna see things

222
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:27,739
escape from their frames.

223
00:14:27,739 --> 00:14:33,002
It involves illusions, plays with subjectivity

224
00:14:33,002 --> 00:14:36,063
and perspective, I love all that stuff.

225
00:14:36,063 --> 00:14:37,363
And it satisfies this.

226
00:14:38,977 --> 00:14:43,979
It relates to this old fantasy of, I think, of putting two pictures up on a wall, or seeing

227
00:14:43,979 --> 00:14:48,462
two pictures on a wall, hanging side by side, and wanting them to kind of melt out of their

228
00:14:48,462 --> 00:14:50,843
frames and join together.

229
00:14:50,843 --> 00:14:59,188
And I had the same fantasy about two computer games running in windows side by side on a

230
00:14:59,188 --> 00:15:03,591
computer screen, and that's sort of what gave rise to this game.

231
00:15:05,868 --> 00:15:07,889
And the stacking variant of the puzzle mechanic

232
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:11,072
I see as the same thing, just in a different axis.

233
00:15:11,072 --> 00:15:14,114
Maybe it's more like adding the last piece

234
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:16,776
to the center of a jigsaw puzzle in that case.

235
00:15:16,776 --> 00:15:20,259
And I'll come back to talk about that mechanic

236
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:24,282
a little bit more later, but first I wanna go back

237
00:15:24,282 --> 00:15:28,905
and trace another part of the design lineage of Gorogoa,

238
00:15:28,905 --> 00:15:31,007
which is the classic adventure game.

239
00:15:32,142 --> 00:15:35,065
And I think especially amongst designers,

240
00:15:35,065 --> 00:15:38,548
those classic adventure game puzzles are often ridiculed

241
00:15:38,548 --> 00:15:42,431
for having needless complexity.

242
00:15:42,431 --> 00:15:46,315
The nouns and verbs and the mechanical language

243
00:15:46,315 --> 00:15:51,219
are hidden and unclear, and they tend to fetishize,

244
00:15:51,219 --> 00:15:53,141
go out of their way to include

245
00:15:53,141 --> 00:15:55,183
counterintuitive uses for objects,

246
00:15:55,183 --> 00:15:58,806
which makes it hard to reason and solve puzzles.

247
00:16:00,053 --> 00:16:03,815
And many modern puzzle games separate puzzles

248
00:16:03,815 --> 00:16:05,816
more cleanly from the world.

249
00:16:05,816 --> 00:16:09,517
They have an unambiguous noun-verb set,

250
00:16:09,517 --> 00:16:11,858
clear and consistent visual language.

251
00:16:11,858 --> 00:16:15,220
I mean, think about test chambers in Portal

252
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,761
or the panels in The Witness.

253
00:16:17,761 --> 00:16:22,423
But I grew up loving those adventure games

254
00:16:22,423 --> 00:16:25,884
and I partly loved them for the very qualities

255
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:29,566
that some designers wanted to expunge.

256
00:16:30,513 --> 00:16:36,457
And I think the core fantasy of those games, or part of that fantasy, was lost in that

257
00:16:36,457 --> 00:16:39,258
process of modernization.

258
00:16:39,258 --> 00:16:44,602
Because I think that fantasy is not just about inhabiting a clever character.

259
00:16:44,602 --> 00:16:47,063
I think it's a fantasy about a world.

260
00:16:47,063 --> 00:16:50,966
It's inhabiting a world full of hidden potential.

261
00:16:52,453 --> 00:16:58,498
And those games love the exotic repurposing of ordinary objects

262
00:16:58,498 --> 00:17:02,541
because that's about elevating, in my mind, that's about elevating the ordinary.

263
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:08,745
It requires us to look closely and carefully at everyday things for a second layer of meaning.

264
00:17:08,745 --> 00:17:14,329
And some of that is lost when puzzles are too cleanly set apart from the world.

265
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:22,141
I also think that fantasy, unlike a lot of video game fantasies, maps, readily maps back

266
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,022
onto the real world.

267
00:17:24,022 --> 00:17:29,485
It's something humans have always yearned to believe, I think, that there are these

268
00:17:29,485 --> 00:17:35,548
secret compartments of meaning in the world around us that were put there by something

269
00:17:35,548 --> 00:17:40,290
larger and invisible that's leaving us messages.

270
00:17:42,715 --> 00:17:50,587
I, a friend of my mom's, who is a poet, honestly believed for much of his life that the reality

271
00:17:50,587 --> 00:17:57,057
around us is a projection of the unconscious mind, like a very lucid dream.

272
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:05,959
And so he used a version of Freudian dream analysis on waking life,

273
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:09,180
which means he looked at objects and events around him,

274
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:13,423
interpreted them as coded symbols from his unconscious mind.

275
00:18:14,395 --> 00:18:18,657
So when he arrived in a new part of the country,

276
00:18:18,657 --> 00:18:20,077
he would start looking for clues.

277
00:18:20,077 --> 00:18:23,158
He would look at a poster on the side of a building,

278
00:18:23,158 --> 00:18:26,819
or the street signs at an intersection,

279
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:29,480
or a flyer on the ground.

280
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,920
And he would rearrange letters.

281
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,240
He would look for visual puns.

282
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,582
And he would follow these clues one by one,

283
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:40,203
and that until he figured out where he was supposed to live.

284
00:18:42,644 --> 00:18:47,468
And obviously I have some logistical and metaphysical problems with that theory.

285
00:18:47,468 --> 00:18:52,692
But I think we can all understand why someone might want to believe that.

286
00:18:52,692 --> 00:18:57,255
The world is frightening and it's chaotic and it's a compelling notion

287
00:18:57,255 --> 00:19:00,337
that something invisible is speaking to us.

288
00:19:00,337 --> 00:19:07,322
Again, it's a deep-seated human compulsion to go looking for that hidden language

289
00:19:07,322 --> 00:19:09,444
with which the cosmos is trying to guide us.

290
00:19:11,332 --> 00:19:15,734
And I think, and again, I think that's obliquely connected to the core fantasy of adventure

291
00:19:15,734 --> 00:19:19,095
games and it's certainly a core theme in Gorgoa, that search.

292
00:19:19,095 --> 00:19:28,460
So I think of the core mechanic in Gorgoa as sort of like a visual acrostic.

293
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:34,102
An acrostic is, for example, a poem where the first letter of each line forms a vertical

294
00:19:34,102 --> 00:19:38,104
word and unlike crossword puzzles, they're often hidden.

295
00:19:40,043 --> 00:19:45,747
And I'm going to argue that on a cross that can be a spiritual or a metaphysical metaphor,

296
00:19:45,747 --> 00:19:51,511
because it's an almost literal depiction of transcendent meaning.

297
00:19:51,511 --> 00:19:58,516
If you look at only the expected form, reading horizontally, you're missing something essential.

298
00:19:58,516 --> 00:20:00,998
The answer lies on an invisible axis.

299
00:20:00,998 --> 00:20:07,703
You have to rotate your perception out of that axis to see a transverse vein of meaning.

300
00:20:10,313 --> 00:20:14,876
And that's a powerful idea because it means that humble objects can be the intersection

301
00:20:14,876 --> 00:20:20,361
point between those two dimensions, between the ordinary and the eternal or otherworldly.

302
00:20:20,361 --> 00:20:28,106
And so that allows the sacred, if you will, to be accessible through the mundane without

303
00:20:28,106 --> 00:20:31,389
being contained or constrained by the mundane.

304
00:20:32,659 --> 00:20:37,363
So I think of this poet's view of the world

305
00:20:37,363 --> 00:20:39,105
as being like a cosmic acrostic.

306
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:43,829
Poster on the wall is like a letter that's in two sentences.

307
00:20:43,829 --> 00:20:47,493
It belongs to two different dimensions of meaning.

308
00:20:47,493 --> 00:20:49,755
One dimension is to sell tobacco,

309
00:20:49,755 --> 00:20:53,158
and the other dimension is to tell my mom's friend

310
00:20:53,158 --> 00:20:54,680
where to go to look for the next clue.

311
00:20:57,012 --> 00:20:59,675
So what do I mean by a visual acrostic?

312
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,637
Well, it means that elements in Gorgo

313
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:04,339
belong to two crossing axes of meaning,

314
00:21:04,339 --> 00:21:06,481
and not just the obvious axes of the grid.

315
00:21:06,481 --> 00:21:11,966
Here we have something that's a piece of a train map

316
00:21:11,966 --> 00:21:15,890
on one axis, but on a different axis it's a ladder.

317
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:20,134
Here you have a figure in a window on one axis of meaning,

318
00:21:20,134 --> 00:21:22,476
and on the other axis it's a profile on a coin.

319
00:21:23,656 --> 00:21:27,821
Here's the edifice of a building in one dimension

320
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:31,645
and in the other dimension it is part of a Pachinko machine

321
00:21:31,645 --> 00:21:33,827
for this falling rock puzzle.

322
00:21:33,827 --> 00:21:37,271
So everything has a dual nature

323
00:21:37,271 --> 00:21:41,295
and that was an essential principle of the design.

324
00:21:41,295 --> 00:21:44,339
So like the scaffolding that you see here.

325
00:21:45,589 --> 00:21:49,112
which is part of this falling rock sequence.

326
00:21:49,112 --> 00:21:53,415
It's built to slow the rock down so the puzzle is easier to solve.

327
00:21:53,415 --> 00:21:56,318
But it's also there to repair the building that it's on,

328
00:21:56,318 --> 00:21:58,179
which has been damaged in a war.

329
00:21:58,179 --> 00:22:01,442
So it has a place in the chronology of the game world.

330
00:22:01,442 --> 00:22:04,344
The banners exist as visual clues

331
00:22:04,344 --> 00:22:06,386
to help the player connect the tiles together.

332
00:22:06,386 --> 00:22:09,428
But they're also there to advertise the opening of the museum.

333
00:22:11,303 --> 00:22:14,725
And the same is true for other scenes in the same sequence.

334
00:22:14,725 --> 00:22:19,527
You have ribbons that are wrapping sacred objects

335
00:22:19,527 --> 00:22:20,387
in this basement.

336
00:22:20,387 --> 00:22:23,808
And sometimes I will build scenes in the game

337
00:22:23,808 --> 00:22:28,330
so that they allow me to include a lot of exotic,

338
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,431
varied objects in one place, like a museum

339
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:33,492
or a basement where religious artifacts are being stored.

340
00:22:33,492 --> 00:22:35,993
So that's a bit of a cheat, but...

341
00:22:37,265 --> 00:22:40,046
The point is that everything should seem,

342
00:22:40,046 --> 00:22:42,727
everything should have that duality of meaning,

343
00:22:42,727 --> 00:22:44,248
which means I had to work very hard

344
00:22:44,248 --> 00:22:47,849
so that nothing in the world looks like

345
00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:50,871
it's just there to be part of a puzzle.

346
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:54,372
And an effort is made to justify every puzzle element

347
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:55,813
and every scene within the story.

348
00:22:55,813 --> 00:22:58,334
Because again, that acrostic,

349
00:22:58,334 --> 00:23:03,616
that duality of meaning is essential thematically.

350
00:23:04,906 --> 00:23:07,767
This same rock puzzle, which is the very last puzzle

351
00:23:07,767 --> 00:23:10,148
I put in the game, so I'll talk about it a lot.

352
00:23:10,148 --> 00:23:14,710
It's, and sorry there's no animation here,

353
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:18,132
but it's the only timing puzzle in the game,

354
00:23:18,132 --> 00:23:19,912
and so it was controversial.

355
00:23:19,912 --> 00:23:23,094
But it was added to address a specific issue

356
00:23:23,094 --> 00:23:24,294
with the design.

357
00:23:24,294 --> 00:23:28,356
And that's central tension in Gorgoa

358
00:23:28,356 --> 00:23:32,478
is the balance between sort of discovery and challenge.

359
00:23:33,627 --> 00:23:38,490
Because as I've said, this is thematically became partly

360
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:41,873
about searching for things that are inscrutable and astonishing

361
00:23:41,873 --> 00:23:45,135
and otherworldly, which is partly

362
00:23:45,135 --> 00:23:48,837
about escaping from predictable mechanical patterns.

363
00:23:48,837 --> 00:23:51,499
Fantasy is about exploring beyond the limits

364
00:23:51,499 --> 00:23:53,460
of what we understand, encountering

365
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,142
something large and mysterious.

366
00:23:55,142 --> 00:24:01,526
But how can you solve puzzles without understanding?

367
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:09,923
And I had considered early on just taking the puzzles out.

368
00:24:09,923 --> 00:24:12,164
Many people who loved Gorgoa don't

369
00:24:12,164 --> 00:24:13,665
care that much about puzzles.

370
00:24:13,665 --> 00:24:17,246
They just wanted the experience.

371
00:24:17,246 --> 00:24:19,907
So should I allow players to just explore the world

372
00:24:19,907 --> 00:24:22,349
and stumble across those surprising connections?

373
00:24:22,349 --> 00:24:26,450
That might be truer to the fantasy

374
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:29,732
because those revelations should feel beyond comprehension.

375
00:24:29,732 --> 00:24:32,773
And we want that feeling of a vast and strange universe.

376
00:24:35,078 --> 00:24:40,060
But I, in the end, and admittedly partly because I like puzzles,

377
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,260
I decided to keep them.

378
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,061
I think some degree of challenge is appropriate to the theme

379
00:24:46,061 --> 00:24:50,822
because in a sense this is something we want to be able to believe

380
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:53,563
about the real world and if it were possible to just stumble

381
00:24:53,563 --> 00:24:55,243
across secret connections in the real world,

382
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,464
it would have happened by now.

383
00:24:57,464 --> 00:24:59,824
And also I think those revelations gain substance

384
00:24:59,824 --> 00:25:01,745
from the effort involved to uncover them.

385
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:06,812
We want to be required to look carefully or think differently.

386
00:25:06,812 --> 00:25:12,376
And besides, connection to something greater should, I think instinctively we feel like

387
00:25:12,376 --> 00:25:13,497
it should require some sort of a test.

388
00:25:13,497 --> 00:25:19,420
And also puzzles impose pattern, and some pattern is essential.

389
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:25,224
I'm trying to create a sense of mystery, but mystery is really about, it's not about no

390
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:27,686
pattern, it's about a half-glimpsed pattern.

391
00:25:28,597 --> 00:25:34,442
too little and you feel like there was nothing there to find and too much and the mystery

392
00:25:34,442 --> 00:25:44,931
dissipates. So it's all about the right amount of disorientation. And that balance was crucial.

393
00:25:44,931 --> 00:25:49,835
The surprise and delight of stumbling across something, challenge or test on the other

394
00:25:49,835 --> 00:25:50,276
hand.

395
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:54,154
The way tiles fit together in the game

396
00:25:54,154 --> 00:25:57,658
may be initially surprising and magical,

397
00:25:57,658 --> 00:26:00,882
but at least later in the game,

398
00:26:00,882 --> 00:26:02,503
puzzles are intended to require

399
00:26:02,503 --> 00:26:05,446
an additional reasoning stage after that discovery stage.

400
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:16,328
I decided to limit the mechanical complexity. This train map you see here was going to be

401
00:26:16,328 --> 00:26:21,830
part of a much more complex puzzle where there are multiple piles with multiple maps that

402
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:28,953
fit together and the train goes back and forth through this like headachy spaghetti of train

403
00:26:28,953 --> 00:26:33,495
tracks. But I decided that that was too much pattern in a way, in a sense. Pendulum too

404
00:26:33,495 --> 00:26:34,075
far in one direction.

405
00:26:35,204 --> 00:26:38,425
But coming back to this rock puzzle, again,

406
00:26:38,425 --> 00:26:43,287
sorry that's no animation, but I put it in the game

407
00:26:43,287 --> 00:26:45,928
because it can't be solved accidentally, essentially.

408
00:26:45,928 --> 00:26:47,088
Because it's a timing puzzle, you

409
00:26:47,088 --> 00:26:50,269
have to understand how it works before you solve it.

410
00:26:50,269 --> 00:26:53,950
And that is there as a reassurance.

411
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:56,351
I think the earliest puzzles in the game

412
00:26:56,351 --> 00:27:00,872
are the most amenable to sort of accidental discovery.

413
00:27:00,872 --> 00:27:03,153
And I felt that at this point in the game,

414
00:27:03,153 --> 00:27:04,093
the player needed.

415
00:27:04,746 --> 00:27:08,667
to be reassured that they could get a hold of something, figure out something, and that

416
00:27:08,667 --> 00:27:09,747
there was some sense here.

417
00:27:09,747 --> 00:27:18,710
And similar, another puzzle that comes right after it, this clock tower puzzle, as you're

418
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:23,351
setting the time on a clock, the position of the hands have enough permutations that

419
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:25,832
it makes it difficult to brute force.

420
00:27:25,832 --> 00:27:32,954
And again, that is tipping the balance back towards some degree of reasoning.

421
00:27:34,467 --> 00:27:39,390
The next chapter of the game has a series of these wheel puzzles.

422
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:46,255
You may partly stumble upon the means of turning the wheels, but then you, in theory, have

423
00:27:46,255 --> 00:27:47,656
to think about their orientation.

424
00:27:47,656 --> 00:27:53,020
And that repeated pattern allows players to make some simple deductions.

425
00:27:55,823 --> 00:27:59,305
Okay, one last thing about this rock puzzle,

426
00:27:59,305 --> 00:28:02,226
which is that you can't see it here,

427
00:28:02,226 --> 00:28:05,227
but the way it works is rocks are knocked out

428
00:28:05,227 --> 00:28:07,468
of this box periodically by explosions.

429
00:28:07,468 --> 00:28:09,949
It's a city under bombardment.

430
00:28:09,949 --> 00:28:12,830
And you solve the puzzle by waiting

431
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:15,991
for rocks to fall out of that box.

432
00:28:15,991 --> 00:28:17,912
But why?

433
00:28:17,912 --> 00:28:20,113
I mean, wouldn't it be easier to have the player

434
00:28:20,113 --> 00:28:22,714
just click or tap on the box to generate a rock?

435
00:28:24,046 --> 00:28:26,989
Well, the answer to that question,

436
00:28:26,989 --> 00:28:28,411
I'm gonna take a deep dive on,

437
00:28:28,411 --> 00:28:34,417
because it's a seemingly small design decision

438
00:28:34,417 --> 00:28:35,458
that had a lot of implications.

439
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:39,082
Again, in theory, a high-level vision or aesthetic

440
00:28:39,082 --> 00:28:42,606
should ripple downward to low-level mechanical decisions,

441
00:28:42,606 --> 00:28:45,148
but I think in practice, the opposite happens a lot.

442
00:28:45,148 --> 00:28:46,029
And it's...

443
00:28:46,924 --> 00:28:51,867
a good idea, at least early in development, to allow that bottom-up disruption, because

444
00:28:51,867 --> 00:28:55,630
that may nudge you towards the seed that crystallizes everything else.

445
00:28:55,630 --> 00:29:03,194
So as I mentioned, the game is descended from adventure games, and the scene inside each

446
00:29:03,194 --> 00:29:07,577
tile originally played like an adventure game, including, you know, it basically had mist

447
00:29:07,577 --> 00:29:11,199
controls where you could not only move around but interact physically with objects.

448
00:29:11,199 --> 00:29:15,442
You could open doors, push buttons, you know, turn levers, that kind of thing.

449
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:19,014
And that means, that made it possible to,

450
00:29:19,014 --> 00:29:22,297
it was possible to implement puzzles within a single scene.

451
00:29:22,297 --> 00:29:24,559
I, within a single panel.

452
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,502
So I could put a combination lock on this door here,

453
00:29:27,502 --> 00:29:31,866
and maybe you have to search a nearby graveyard

454
00:29:31,866 --> 00:29:35,129
and find one grave that's better tended than the others,

455
00:29:35,129 --> 00:29:37,991
get the date off that, that's the combination.

456
00:29:37,991 --> 00:29:41,154
Perfectly pleasant puzzle.

457
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:41,795
And.

458
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:51,216
that was nice because designing the puzzles where the two tiles connect is super hard.

459
00:29:51,216 --> 00:29:55,978
And it was a nice safety net. I could pace the game out using these puzzles that are just

460
00:29:55,978 --> 00:29:58,298
inside one scene.

461
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:08,579
But I decided that having those single tile puzzles was diluting the effect of the game. By

462
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:14,144
not using the core mechanic. The core mechanic is about connecting panels, tiles

463
00:30:14,144 --> 00:30:20,589
together. So no single tile puzzles were allowed. I was going to take away my own design

464
00:30:20,589 --> 00:30:21,109
safety net.

465
00:30:24,619 --> 00:30:26,120
which I call the no touching rule.

466
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:30,401
So I'm completely gonna take away the player's ability

467
00:30:30,401 --> 00:30:34,363
to physically interact with the world inside a tile.

468
00:30:34,363 --> 00:30:36,464
And so the player can't bring about any change

469
00:30:36,464 --> 00:30:40,066
in the game world except by combining two or more tiles.

470
00:30:40,066 --> 00:30:43,487
And that, as a new designer,

471
00:30:43,487 --> 00:30:46,728
that felt really virtuous and disciplined

472
00:30:46,728 --> 00:30:48,729
and I was proud of myself for that one.

473
00:30:48,729 --> 00:30:52,051
But there were some complications.

474
00:30:52,626 --> 00:30:56,327
Like, if you look at this system here,

475
00:30:56,327 --> 00:30:58,788
if you have the ability to interact,

476
00:30:58,788 --> 00:31:00,788
you could click on that crank in the top tile

477
00:31:00,788 --> 00:31:01,969
and crank the bucket up.

478
00:31:01,969 --> 00:31:02,769
It rises from one tile to another.

479
00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:04,770
Without that option,

480
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:09,031
the only way I can make this puzzle work

481
00:31:09,031 --> 00:31:13,832
is by adding a counterweight to the other end of the rope.

482
00:31:13,832 --> 00:31:17,193
The player can't put energy into the system,

483
00:31:17,193 --> 00:31:19,794
so I have to build, essentially,

484
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:21,515
potential energy into the world.

485
00:31:24,136 --> 00:31:26,978
But the problem is, or one potential problem is,

486
00:31:26,978 --> 00:31:29,441
that as soon as these two tiles are connected,

487
00:31:29,441 --> 00:31:31,462
the system moves, the bucket goes down,

488
00:31:31,462 --> 00:31:33,484
the weight goes up, and that's a one-time,

489
00:31:33,484 --> 00:31:35,886
one-way state transition.

490
00:31:35,886 --> 00:31:40,490
It's really difficult in the design to reset that.

491
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:42,792
And it's prone to self-solving.

492
00:31:42,792 --> 00:31:44,654
You connect two tiles and something moves

493
00:31:44,654 --> 00:31:47,296
before you even realize what you're doing.

494
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:51,452
If, again, if the player had the ability

495
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:53,193
just to turn that crank at the top,

496
00:31:53,193 --> 00:31:56,915
then it would at least require one extra interaction

497
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,496
after connecting the tiles

498
00:31:58,496 --> 00:32:03,259
before this very, very simple puzzle could be solved.

499
00:32:03,259 --> 00:32:05,921
And also, the player can then,

500
00:32:05,921 --> 00:32:07,782
could crank the bucket up or down,

501
00:32:07,782 --> 00:32:12,925
and that creates a much bigger, more robust state space

502
00:32:12,925 --> 00:32:14,126
for the puzzle to exist in.

503
00:32:14,126 --> 00:32:18,849
So this is a serious constraint on puzzle design.

504
00:32:20,545 --> 00:32:23,866
and the crow puzzle at the beginning of the game

505
00:32:23,866 --> 00:32:27,948
was driven by that decision.

506
00:32:27,948 --> 00:32:31,429
There's no way for the player to knock that fruit loose,

507
00:32:31,429 --> 00:32:34,950
to drop into the bowl, or to shake the branch.

508
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:37,592
So I had to create this crow,

509
00:32:37,592 --> 00:32:39,232
which takes off from the branch,

510
00:32:39,232 --> 00:32:40,473
and that was very expensive.

511
00:32:40,473 --> 00:32:42,253
I had to do all that animation.

512
00:32:42,253 --> 00:32:45,955
So this turns out to be a costly decision.

513
00:32:45,955 --> 00:32:49,656
Here's another puzzle.

514
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:55,521
And a lot of puzzle design in Gorogoa consists of just sitting

515
00:32:55,521 --> 00:32:58,902
around thinking what things look like other things.

516
00:32:58,902 --> 00:33:03,463
A sun sort of looks like a gear if it's done in a stylized form.

517
00:33:03,463 --> 00:33:07,904
Crenelated castle wall looks like a linear gear.

518
00:33:07,904 --> 00:33:11,325
And they could fit together to make a rack and pinion assembly.

519
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:16,126
But it needs moving parts, so how does a player make it move?

520
00:33:19,115 --> 00:33:23,078
Well, this one idea I had is to add a navigation button

521
00:33:23,078 --> 00:33:26,341
that allows the player to move their camera to the right.

522
00:33:26,341 --> 00:33:29,264
So, and if the camera moved to the right,

523
00:33:29,264 --> 00:33:31,706
the wall subjectively moves to the left.

524
00:33:31,706 --> 00:33:36,330
But the sun stays at the same position in the sky

525
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:39,853
because its parallax layer is at infinite distance.

526
00:33:39,853 --> 00:33:44,557
So the relative movement of the two parallax layers

527
00:33:44,557 --> 00:33:46,579
causes that gear to turn.

528
00:33:47,788 --> 00:33:51,550
And I like that approach a lot.

529
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:54,552
It's sort of, I said that looking is supposed to be

530
00:33:54,552 --> 00:33:57,013
a forceful act in Gorgoa,

531
00:33:57,013 --> 00:33:59,274
and this is sort of having that effect.

532
00:33:59,274 --> 00:34:00,075
But it's also sort of cheating,

533
00:34:00,075 --> 00:34:05,598
because the player is changing the state of the world

534
00:34:05,598 --> 00:34:06,458
using just one tile.

535
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:09,740
In a way, I've taken a navigation button

536
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,360
and turned it into a button

537
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,902
that operates a piece of machinery.

538
00:34:14,913 --> 00:34:17,695
So is it really using the core mechanic?

539
00:34:17,695 --> 00:34:19,616
I decided it wasn't.

540
00:34:19,616 --> 00:34:24,400
So instead, I have a scene in the game

541
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,423
where the movement of the camera

542
00:34:28,423 --> 00:34:30,945
is driven by the movement of the character.

543
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:35,888
Character is walking, the camera tracks the character

544
00:34:35,888 --> 00:34:38,830
for cinematic reasons, essentially.

545
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:40,431
And so I get the same effect of camera movement.

546
00:34:40,431 --> 00:34:43,594
But the difference is that the.

547
00:34:45,657 --> 00:34:48,238
the character is literally driving the action now.

548
00:34:48,238 --> 00:34:50,939
And that's much more thematically compelling.

549
00:34:50,939 --> 00:34:53,460
I'm taking the efforts and energy of the character

550
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,642
and I'm literally hooking up a drive train to it.

551
00:34:56,642 --> 00:35:02,584
And it works well with the themes of this chapter

552
00:35:02,584 --> 00:35:06,286
in the game, which is about sort of the role

553
00:35:06,286 --> 00:35:10,888
of repetitive and mechanical ritual in devotion.

554
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:16,019
So, you know, maybe the no touching rule

555
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:17,820
isn't such a liability after all.

556
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,682
Maybe it's leading me in interesting directions

557
00:35:20,682 --> 00:35:23,023
I wouldn't have gone in otherwise.

558
00:35:23,023 --> 00:35:27,125
And even more than that, because by taking away

559
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,767
the player's ability to physically interact with the world,

560
00:35:30,767 --> 00:35:32,708
I've disembodied them.

561
00:35:32,708 --> 00:35:35,250
And that turned out to liberate

562
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,391
my whole thinking about the game.

563
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:42,106
For example, a disembodied character

564
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:45,028
can just fly across space.

565
00:35:45,028 --> 00:35:48,311
It doesn't require any physical explanation.

566
00:35:48,311 --> 00:35:49,832
Nobody ever questions it

567
00:35:49,832 --> 00:35:55,176
because there's no sense of physical presence in the world.

568
00:35:55,176 --> 00:36:01,121
Disembodied player can enter a character's thoughts

569
00:36:01,121 --> 00:36:01,481
or memories.

570
00:36:01,481 --> 00:36:08,046
You can enter the world inside the China pattern on a plate.

571
00:36:10,497 --> 00:36:11,818
that was really powerful.

572
00:36:11,818 --> 00:36:16,242
And I don't know that maybe players would have accepted that

573
00:36:16,242 --> 00:36:19,284
in addition to and still be able to turn cranks,

574
00:36:19,284 --> 00:36:22,007
but not thinking of the player as embodied,

575
00:36:22,007 --> 00:36:24,248
freed up my mind as a designer.

576
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:25,149
And at an even higher level,

577
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:31,694
limiting the player's interaction

578
00:36:31,694 --> 00:36:36,698
makes the relationship between the player and the story

579
00:36:36,698 --> 00:36:38,700
more oblique and mysterious.

580
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:45,221
And that leaves room for a wider range of interpretations

581
00:36:45,221 --> 00:36:48,402
about what the interaction with the game means.

582
00:36:48,402 --> 00:36:51,443
And notably, it allows the entire game to feel

583
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:55,464
as much like a mental process as a physical process.

584
00:36:55,464 --> 00:37:00,745
Like maybe someone sorting through fragments

585
00:37:00,745 --> 00:37:05,787
of experience or memory, looking for those connections.

586
00:37:05,787 --> 00:37:06,707
And

587
00:37:07,521 --> 00:37:14,944
Gorgo is often called dreamlike and some interpretations of what dreams are about have to do with that

588
00:37:14,944 --> 00:37:20,346
process of sifting through these chunks of experience and trying to find patterns within

589
00:37:20,346 --> 00:37:20,806
them.

590
00:37:20,806 --> 00:37:29,750
And again, this connects to the properties of a frame, this idea of

591
00:37:30,526 --> 00:37:33,089
the mental process of sorting through memories,

592
00:37:33,089 --> 00:37:36,332
because the frame creates that same sort

593
00:37:36,332 --> 00:37:39,836
of melancholy distance that you have,

594
00:37:39,836 --> 00:37:42,820
the same relationship you have to memories.

595
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:46,283
There are scenes you can see and examine

596
00:37:46,283 --> 00:37:49,026
and kind of turn over in your mind, but never re-enter.

597
00:37:55,702 --> 00:38:02,443
So again, this is a relatively secondary or tertiary decision.

598
00:38:02,443 --> 00:38:05,184
It didn't, this no touching rule,

599
00:38:05,184 --> 00:38:11,225
that didn't seem to me like a, it seemed optional.

600
00:38:11,225 --> 00:38:13,065
Like the game could have been built with or without

601
00:38:13,065 --> 00:38:14,806
that decision.

602
00:38:14,806 --> 00:38:18,566
But having made it one way, that rippled up

603
00:38:18,566 --> 00:38:20,287
to not just to affect the game all the way

604
00:38:20,287 --> 00:38:22,407
at the narrative and thematic level, ultimately.

605
00:38:24,687 --> 00:38:28,590
So, speaking of narrative,

606
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:31,031
what kind of story does it make sense

607
00:38:31,031 --> 00:38:33,212
to tell with these mechanics?

608
00:38:33,212 --> 00:38:37,455
This is a question I asked very late in the process,

609
00:38:37,455 --> 00:38:42,718
in a way, I had to kind of feel my way to this solution

610
00:38:42,718 --> 00:38:45,700
as, you know, before I was able

611
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,661
to think about it consciously.

612
00:38:46,661 --> 00:38:50,643
And since it's a puzzle game,

613
00:38:51,712 --> 00:38:55,454
The basic question is how do you combine puzzle and narrative?

614
00:38:55,454 --> 00:38:59,096
Well, there's a tried and true approach, which is puzzles as obstacles

615
00:38:59,096 --> 00:39:02,759
for a protagonist in a typical dramatic narrative.

616
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:04,220
Story needs obstacles.

617
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:10,104
The protagonist needs to demonstrate cunning or perseverance.

618
00:39:10,104 --> 00:39:11,224
So it works great.

619
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:13,146
It's classic for a reason.

620
00:39:13,146 --> 00:39:15,707
But, Gorgo, it doesn't work that way at all.

621
00:39:17,424 --> 00:39:19,827
it sort of turns that model inside out.

622
00:39:19,827 --> 00:39:22,529
Instead of puzzles inside of a story,

623
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:25,292
it's a story suspended inside a puzzle.

624
00:39:25,292 --> 00:39:28,275
The protagonist isn't solving puzzles.

625
00:39:28,275 --> 00:39:30,477
The player is solving puzzles,

626
00:39:30,477 --> 00:39:33,660
and from sort of an external god-like perspective,

627
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:37,724
and the player moves independently of the protagonist.

628
00:39:37,724 --> 00:39:39,786
They just, the two sort of cross paths.

629
00:39:41,678 --> 00:39:49,031
And at least to me, I mean, puzzles you solve in the game do facilitate character traversal,

630
00:39:49,031 --> 00:39:54,820
but many of them, at least in my mind, are as much about discovering the story as advancing

631
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,321
the story.

632
00:39:57,894 --> 00:40:00,997
So is any of this a good idea?

633
00:40:00,997 --> 00:40:04,980
I could rip all the pages out of a great novel

634
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:08,602
and hide them around the city,

635
00:40:08,602 --> 00:40:12,345
and the novel might be a delightful read,

636
00:40:12,345 --> 00:40:15,648
and looking for the pages

637
00:40:15,648 --> 00:40:17,910
might be a delightful scavenger hunt,

638
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:20,952
but are those two unrelated delights

639
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:22,033
that I've just stuck together?

640
00:40:22,033 --> 00:40:24,134
And the story of the novel might suffer from pacing issues

641
00:40:24,134 --> 00:40:26,256
as you find the pages out of order, et cetera.

642
00:40:27,496 --> 00:40:32,579
So that steered me away from a traditional dramatic narrative,

643
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:35,741
because the emotional arc and act structure

644
00:40:35,741 --> 00:40:37,942
would be too disrupted.

645
00:40:37,942 --> 00:40:41,044
The chronology is all chopped up and scattered and folded back

646
00:40:41,044 --> 00:40:42,645
on itself.

647
00:40:42,645 --> 00:40:44,707
And I was drawn more towards something

648
00:40:44,707 --> 00:40:47,588
like that is a like a parable that

649
00:40:47,588 --> 00:40:50,350
suits the spiritual themes of the game

650
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,571
and what I'm trying to say.

651
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:59,981
A parable is instructive, it's an act of communication, typically there to give the teaching a lesson

652
00:40:59,981 --> 00:41:01,642
of some kind.

653
00:41:01,642 --> 00:41:07,643
It doesn't just exist to provide dramatic satisfaction.

654
00:41:07,643 --> 00:41:12,025
You're not supposed to entirely lose yourself or forget that it's a story.

655
00:41:14,942 --> 00:41:19,024
And that is, that's related again to the form of the game.

656
00:41:19,024 --> 00:41:23,286
Like I say, a frame, by its nature, feels like a clue.

657
00:41:23,286 --> 00:41:24,446
So it feels instructive,

658
00:41:24,446 --> 00:41:26,707
it feels like an act of communication.

659
00:41:26,707 --> 00:41:29,268
And because you are looking at the game world

660
00:41:29,268 --> 00:41:32,089
through this shrunk down small window,

661
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:35,891
that allows you to keep at least one eye

662
00:41:35,891 --> 00:41:37,371
on the exterior world.

663
00:41:37,371 --> 00:41:40,252
And so you don't forget that you're being told a story

664
00:41:40,252 --> 00:41:43,654
and you don't forget to ask why you're being told that story.

665
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:48,574
So I feel like the form of the game is putting the player

666
00:41:48,574 --> 00:41:55,821
into the right posture to interact with a parable.

667
00:41:55,821 --> 00:41:58,884
Parables are often puzzles in that they're,

668
00:41:58,884 --> 00:42:02,528
you know, hidden in allegories.

669
00:42:02,528 --> 00:42:06,813
They are a riddle that has to be unlocked.

670
00:42:08,103 --> 00:42:14,328
Unlike the search for the novel pages, in this case that might be a virtue

671
00:42:14,328 --> 00:42:17,650
because the act of solving the riddle is part

672
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:19,672
of the message of the parable.

673
00:42:19,672 --> 00:42:22,774
I think every parable that requires this kind

674
00:42:22,774 --> 00:42:24,916
of unlocking has a second, in addition

675
00:42:24,916 --> 00:42:28,559
to whatever its specific lesson is, it has a second more general lesson

676
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:32,041
which is about how to look for meaning in the world,

677
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:34,743
to always look for that second layer.

678
00:42:37,667 --> 00:42:41,610
So this is why I argue that it is acrostic in the sense that I mean.

679
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:46,994
At least if it's an allegorical parable.

680
00:42:46,994 --> 00:42:55,100
It teaches us, exists to teach us that lesson of duality, of meaning.

681
00:42:55,100 --> 00:43:05,048
And that just leaves the final question, a parable about what?

682
00:43:07,175 --> 00:43:17,160
I, again, this, well, I don't want to reveal too much, but it is about the lifelong quest

683
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:17,580
for that.

684
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,602
hidden transcendent meaning.

685
00:43:20,602 --> 00:43:25,247
So it sort of, it folds back on itself conceptually.

686
00:43:25,247 --> 00:43:32,054
There is a dramatic narrative contained inside the game.

687
00:43:32,054 --> 00:43:37,060
So it is, in a sense, it functions on two levels at once.

688
00:43:37,722 --> 00:43:41,604
It is meant to be a story about a character,

689
00:43:41,604 --> 00:43:47,148
but also it is meant to be structured and read as a fable.

690
00:43:47,148 --> 00:43:53,132
Maybe one way of looking at it is it is an attempt

691
00:43:53,132 --> 00:43:59,276
to look at a real life, at the pieces and fragments

692
00:43:59,276 --> 00:44:03,379
of a real life, and retroactively impose

693
00:44:03,379 --> 00:44:05,501
the structure of a parable, of a fable.

694
00:44:05,975 --> 00:44:09,137
a parable, upon that life.

695
00:44:09,137 --> 00:44:10,698
And you can make of that what you will.

696
00:44:10,698 --> 00:44:17,882
Again, I don't know how well this worked.

697
00:44:17,882 --> 00:44:23,786
The story of the game and how it comes across

698
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,967
is one of the things I'm most uncertain about in the end

699
00:44:25,967 --> 00:44:26,408
product, I think.

700
00:44:26,408 --> 00:44:33,032
Creating a sense of mystery was a core goal of the product.

701
00:44:33,032 --> 00:44:34,293
I was inspired by.

702
00:44:35,658 --> 00:44:40,580
I was particularly inspired by this puzzle book called Maze that I played when I was

703
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:40,880
a kid.

704
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,401
And I never solved it.

705
00:44:42,401 --> 00:44:50,065
Which meant that the mystery of that unsolved book was something that I carried with me

706
00:44:50,065 --> 00:44:51,025
my whole life.

707
00:44:51,025 --> 00:44:59,289
And I wanted to recreate that feeling, but I couldn't do it by making an unsolvable

708
00:44:59,289 --> 00:45:00,550
game.

709
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:02,751
So I had to find some other way to make mystery an inherent part of the experience.

710
00:45:03,805 --> 00:45:08,026
The story in the game, I never went out of my way

711
00:45:08,026 --> 00:45:12,627
to make it more obscure, but I also

712
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:16,368
allowed the inherent sort of obscurity

713
00:45:16,368 --> 00:45:20,368
of the storytelling mechanism to function as an asset,

714
00:45:20,368 --> 00:45:21,348
I think, or I hope.

715
00:45:21,348 --> 00:45:24,429
And as for the story of the game,

716
00:45:24,429 --> 00:45:27,169
I'll leave the rest up to your interpretation.

717
00:45:27,169 --> 00:45:29,050
And that's it.

718
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:30,510
So thanks.

719
00:45:39,993 --> 00:45:44,555
We have time for questions. If you have a question for Jason, please go to one of the

720
00:45:44,555 --> 00:45:50,798
mics in the aisles and I'll start things off. So because the game is multi-platform, were

721
00:45:50,798 --> 00:45:54,139
there any puzzles that you wanted to make that you couldn't because it has to be playable

722
00:45:54,139 --> 00:45:56,020
with a mouse and a finger and a controller?

723
00:45:56,020 --> 00:46:00,022
Well, the multi-platform decision was made relatively late.

724
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:08,482
Again, there's one timing puzzle in the game and that became an issue with the Switch because

725
00:46:08,482 --> 00:46:16,446
just the operating the pointer with the control stick is just slightly more challenging.

726
00:46:16,446 --> 00:46:19,127
And so we thought that puzzle might be a deal breaker.

727
00:46:19,127 --> 00:46:26,531
It might need to be altered for the Switch, but in the end we decided it worked well enough.

728
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:27,657
Hi.

729
00:46:27,657 --> 00:46:27,917
Whoa.

730
00:46:27,917 --> 00:46:33,985
As a designer of some of those old school adventure games,

731
00:46:33,985 --> 00:46:36,167
I really enjoyed this a lot.

732
00:46:36,167 --> 00:46:39,472
I think you managed to kind of capture a lot of the feeling,

733
00:46:39,472 --> 00:46:41,795
as you said, but with a very fresh approach.

734
00:46:42,596 --> 00:46:45,037
One of the things that I thought that was inherent in

735
00:46:45,037 --> 00:46:48,880
what you did that really solved a problem that we had

736
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,443
with the old and even some of the new school adventure games

737
00:46:52,443 --> 00:46:56,446
is that you always want to have a degree of choices, but

738
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:58,708
not so many choices that you feel that you're just going

739
00:46:58,708 --> 00:47:01,971
through 50 different locations trying 17 different objects

740
00:47:01,971 --> 00:47:03,372
with each thing you can find in there.

741
00:47:03,372 --> 00:47:07,575
And I found that the four panels.

742
00:47:07,855 --> 00:47:13,158
were a perfect way to do that and that it never was able to get too complicated, even

743
00:47:13,158 --> 00:47:17,720
though the depth of each panel meant that there were lots of other choices, but there

744
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:23,802
never was this sort of bewildering complexity. And I'm wondering if you experimented with

745
00:47:23,802 --> 00:47:31,245
going to 3x3 or 4x4 or whether you just hit on that 2x2 as early on as the optimum.

746
00:47:31,245 --> 00:47:34,587
Okay, so the question is about...

747
00:47:37,138 --> 00:47:41,399
considering a three by three grid, et cetera,

748
00:47:41,399 --> 00:47:44,439
and about the implications for not confusing the player.

749
00:47:44,439 --> 00:47:47,220
And yes, that is a big reason why it's a two by two grid.

750
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:50,680
One, another reason is that the bigger the grid,

751
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,881
the smaller the tiles, or you have to add another layer

752
00:47:53,881 --> 00:47:55,641
of zoom to zoom in on parts of the grid,

753
00:47:55,641 --> 00:47:57,821
which is too complicated.

754
00:47:57,821 --> 00:48:00,582
But yeah, it's clear from testing the game,

755
00:48:00,582 --> 00:48:03,742
especially because scenes within tiles are very deep

756
00:48:03,742 --> 00:48:05,523
in the sense that you can like dive.

757
00:48:05,701 --> 00:48:08,262
through sort of multiple layers of reality.

758
00:48:08,262 --> 00:48:11,503
And four tiles was clearly the absolute limit

759
00:48:11,503 --> 00:48:14,144
of what people could keep track of.

760
00:48:14,144 --> 00:48:17,446
And in fact, there are, the number of scenes

761
00:48:17,446 --> 00:48:20,667
with four tiles in Gorgoa is actually limited

762
00:48:20,667 --> 00:48:22,308
for that reason.

763
00:48:22,308 --> 00:48:25,449
It's usually two or three to make it more comprehensible.

764
00:48:25,768 --> 00:48:27,649
And one data point for you.

765
00:48:27,649 --> 00:48:31,091
I thought that the story was intriguing,

766
00:48:31,091 --> 00:48:33,852
but I appreciated the part that I got through the whole game

767
00:48:33,852 --> 00:48:35,912
without ever thinking very hard about it

768
00:48:35,912 --> 00:48:38,954
and just sort of experiencing it in that dreamlike way.

769
00:48:38,954 --> 00:48:41,795
And I like the fact I kept waiting for some point

770
00:48:41,795 --> 00:48:44,916
where you were going to penalize me for not having caught

771
00:48:44,916 --> 00:48:46,697
some critical story piece.

772
00:48:46,697 --> 00:48:49,177
So I appreciate the fact that that was optional.

773
00:48:49,177 --> 00:48:49,898
You're welcome.

774
00:48:53,474 --> 00:48:54,495
Hi there.

775
00:48:54,495 --> 00:48:58,196
Thanks for a beautiful game and a really intriguing talk.

776
00:48:58,196 --> 00:49:03,098
My question was just more from a practical perspective.

777
00:49:03,098 --> 00:49:07,800
Playing the demo a few years ago, and then playing the

778
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:11,822
finished game, I picked up small elements from the demo

779
00:49:11,822 --> 00:49:13,423
that had been rearranged.

780
00:49:14,483 --> 00:49:17,184
I was just wondering how did you keep track of it all?

781
00:49:17,184 --> 00:49:18,644
And sort of when you were...

782
00:49:18,644 --> 00:49:19,804
I assume you must have...

783
00:49:19,804 --> 00:49:24,045
There must have been a lot of rearranging of puzzles and orders of things.

784
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:26,185
And how do you keep it all in your head?

785
00:49:26,185 --> 00:49:27,226
It just seems so...

786
00:49:27,226 --> 00:49:33,667
So the question is about how I keep track of the various pieces of the game

787
00:49:33,667 --> 00:49:36,287
and the design that I have to move around between iterations.

788
00:49:36,287 --> 00:49:36,607
I...

789
00:49:36,607 --> 00:49:37,147
It is...

790
00:49:37,147 --> 00:49:43,508
It was mostly in my head and then the game itself becomes a document.

791
00:49:45,762 --> 00:49:50,284
I did, so yeah, I thrown out a lot of work on the game,

792
00:49:50,284 --> 00:49:55,006
and as I said, I put too much work into chunks of content

793
00:49:55,006 --> 00:49:56,407
that didn't make sense,

794
00:49:56,407 --> 00:49:59,648
or that were not justified thematically.

795
00:49:59,648 --> 00:50:05,711
And when I cut something, I cut a whole puzzle out.

796
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,632
I always think, can I repurpose this?

797
00:50:07,632 --> 00:50:10,773
Can I salvage it and stick it someplace else?

798
00:50:10,773 --> 00:50:12,734
And occasionally, sort of, but...

799
00:50:13,019 --> 00:50:16,281
most of the time didn't work and stuff that was cut just, I mean,

800
00:50:16,281 --> 00:50:18,984
it might be able to take one little piece of the art and reuse it,

801
00:50:18,984 --> 00:50:24,188
but so for the most part, stuff that was cut just went away.

802
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:28,251
So I didn't have to keep track of it. And, uh, yeah.

803
00:50:28,251 --> 00:50:28,332
Hi.

804
00:50:32,357 --> 00:50:33,358
I have a question about the...

805
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:36,959
You mentioned traditionally the emotional arc,

806
00:50:36,959 --> 00:50:40,980
a story arc, is too disruptive for the game,

807
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:44,742
but a lot of happenings in the game is also unretractable.

808
00:50:44,742 --> 00:50:47,423
You can't return to the previous state.

809
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:50,084
Why particularly this emotional arc

810
00:50:50,084 --> 00:50:52,925
or story arc is too disruptive?

811
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:54,425
Can you explain?

812
00:50:54,425 --> 00:50:56,006
Sorry, what was that last part?

813
00:50:56,006 --> 00:51:00,327
Why the emotional arc, you think it is too disruptive,

814
00:51:00,327 --> 00:51:01,948
so you intentionally took it out?

815
00:51:02,975 --> 00:51:09,699
Well, so why do I think that the emotional arc of the game was disrupted by the format?

816
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:20,245
Because if I think of the story of the game as I see it as being like an act structure,

817
00:51:20,245 --> 00:51:22,226
like a three-act structure, then...

818
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:27,704
several of the acts are happening in parallel as you play the game.

819
00:51:27,704 --> 00:51:32,608
You're seeing two different threads from two different points in time

820
00:51:32,608 --> 00:51:38,174
at the same time, often.

821
00:51:38,174 --> 00:51:40,896
And again, you may not have even realized that,

822
00:51:40,896 --> 00:51:47,682
and that's part of why that arc gets, that story arc gets disrupted.

823
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:54,993
time is mixing, different periods of time are mixing with each other throughout the

824
00:51:54,993 --> 00:52:01,917
course of the game. And that, and usually when you want to tell a story, you want to

825
00:52:01,917 --> 00:52:07,040
tell it in chronological order, unless you've got a very good reason not to. So, that's

826
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,982
why I felt like the traditional arc was, was challenging.

827
00:52:16,118 --> 00:52:21,882
Hi, I just have a question about earlier you mentioned that those banners on the museum

828
00:52:21,882 --> 00:52:26,325
were to kind of also, they serve the purpose of showing the player like where they can

829
00:52:26,325 --> 00:52:31,548
connect with the other frames as well as the narrative implications.

830
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:36,171
I was just curious if you had like a hard and fast rule for every frame of this will

831
00:52:36,171 --> 00:52:40,554
be an obvious clue for the player or if like how did you balance how much to hold their

832
00:52:40,554 --> 00:52:45,597
hand and how much to let them kind of shuffle the pieces around to figure it out?

833
00:52:46,736 --> 00:52:55,522
Right, thanks. How did I balance giving player guidance with kind of disguising puzzle elements

834
00:52:55,522 --> 00:53:03,228
as part of the world? I guess playtesting is a big part of that and partly by feel,

835
00:53:03,228 --> 00:53:03,568
but...

836
00:53:05,343 --> 00:53:08,504
In that, again, so that puzzle with the falling rock

837
00:53:08,504 --> 00:53:11,886
and the banners, that was one of the last puzzles.

838
00:53:11,886 --> 00:53:15,047
And so I worked hard to find visual elements

839
00:53:15,047 --> 00:53:16,968
that were both justified within the world,

840
00:53:16,968 --> 00:53:19,789
but also really strong.

841
00:53:19,789 --> 00:53:22,751
Because if you don't, that puzzle's complex enough

842
00:53:22,751 --> 00:53:25,532
that if people don't get the connection pretty quickly,

843
00:53:25,532 --> 00:53:26,973
they're gonna be frustrated.

844
00:53:26,973 --> 00:53:30,274
So how is the balance achieved?

845
00:53:30,274 --> 00:53:33,155
A lot of trial and error and seeing how people react to it.

846
00:53:33,155 --> 00:53:34,056
Thank you.

847
00:53:36,115 --> 00:53:38,558
Thank you for the talk.

848
00:53:38,558 --> 00:53:42,722
How do you decide on the elements you're going to use?

849
00:53:42,722 --> 00:53:46,706
That makes the puzzle seem very connected,

850
00:53:46,706 --> 00:53:48,748
even though it is very,

851
00:53:48,748 --> 00:53:52,432
like it jumps a lot.

852
00:53:52,432 --> 00:53:55,355
Like it leaves the space,

853
00:53:55,355 --> 00:53:57,717
and how can you decide this balance?

854
00:53:57,717 --> 00:53:58,978
The balance between.

855
00:54:00,228 --> 00:54:08,274
the balance between the theme and the elements you're using in different puzzles

856
00:54:08,274 --> 00:54:15,580
and the transition, like the smooth transition between them?

857
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:18,703
Well, I mean, so the balance between...

858
00:54:20,741 --> 00:54:24,044
Scene elements as puzzle, as mechanical pieces

859
00:54:24,044 --> 00:54:28,487
and scene elements as, you know, story elements.

860
00:54:28,487 --> 00:54:32,490
Again, that's largely a matter of trial and error.

861
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:39,055
As far as, I mean, you're talking about sort of the flow

862
00:54:39,055 --> 00:54:40,776
through the game.

863
00:54:40,776 --> 00:54:42,497
Okay, five minutes.

864
00:54:42,497 --> 00:54:46,400
Yeah, well, one thing that flow from scene to scene

865
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,922
was very important to me.

866
00:54:48,922 --> 00:54:49,643
I didn't ever want to.

867
00:54:51,765 --> 00:54:53,485
have an edit or a cut.

868
00:54:53,485 --> 00:54:58,967
So things flow from

869
00:54:58,967 --> 00:55:05,950
one scene or moment in the game to another to

870
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:08,250
create a sensation of flow

871
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:12,091
and sort of calm movement through space.

872
00:55:13,533 --> 00:55:14,253
Does that help?

873
00:55:14,253 --> 00:55:18,656
And another question, how can you

874
00:55:18,656 --> 00:55:24,600
put a high-level philosophical idea into a solid mechanic?

875
00:55:26,138 --> 00:55:29,582
Well, I mean, like I say, I sort of worked.

876
00:55:29,582 --> 00:55:31,844
So how do you put a high-level philosophical idea

877
00:55:31,844 --> 00:55:33,985
into a concrete mechanic?

878
00:55:33,985 --> 00:55:34,726
Yeah.

879
00:55:34,726 --> 00:55:36,668
Like I say, I sort of worked backwards,

880
00:55:36,668 --> 00:55:38,790
partly consciously and partly unconsciously,

881
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:40,091
from having built something.

882
00:55:40,091 --> 00:55:42,553
I mean, I built the original demo

883
00:55:42,553 --> 00:55:44,455
based on kind of a feeling.

884
00:55:45,055 --> 00:55:48,539
And that feeling was driven by the formal and mechanical

885
00:55:48,539 --> 00:55:50,180
properties of the game.

886
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,422
But then in order to make more of it,

887
00:55:52,422 --> 00:55:57,347
I had to figure out what philosophically

888
00:55:57,347 --> 00:55:59,589
the structure of the game was saying,

889
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:01,991
and then make the game about that.

890
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:04,753
So it was kind of the other way, start with the mechanic

891
00:56:04,753 --> 00:56:05,914
and find the philosophy.

892
00:56:05,914 --> 00:56:06,135
Thank you.

893
00:56:09,355 --> 00:56:09,775
Hi.

894
00:56:09,775 --> 00:56:14,177
Yeah, you clearly put in a ton of emotional and mental energy

895
00:56:14,177 --> 00:56:16,258
into this entire experience.

896
00:56:16,258 --> 00:56:18,639
And how do you continue persevering

897
00:56:18,639 --> 00:56:24,941
in the face of discouragement and conflict and distress?

898
00:56:24,941 --> 00:56:30,063
What keeps you going?

899
00:56:30,063 --> 00:56:31,983
I guess, well, I mean, maybe because.

900
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:35,682
So what keeps me going on a long project?

901
00:56:35,682 --> 00:56:40,166
Well, sometimes my productivity did falter sometimes.

902
00:56:40,166 --> 00:56:42,668
Sometimes I did feel like giving up.

903
00:56:44,405 --> 00:56:48,449
I think one important feature is that the game, the visual art part of the game, was

904
00:56:48,449 --> 00:56:50,532
very nourishing to work on.

905
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:57,519
So making art is, for me, is pleasurable and it makes me, it has a short feedback loop

906
00:56:57,519 --> 00:57:00,363
to make me feel good, feel good about myself.

907
00:57:00,363 --> 00:57:03,847
Whereas game design is the opposite.

908
00:57:03,847 --> 00:57:05,769
It's like broken for a long time.

909
00:57:06,807 --> 00:57:12,691
So to some extent the game was the source of strength for me

910
00:57:12,691 --> 00:57:13,832
during that part of my life.

911
00:57:13,832 --> 00:57:18,295
So it was the thing I was most interested in doing

912
00:57:18,295 --> 00:57:19,375
and working on.

913
00:57:19,375 --> 00:57:22,077
So it wasn't the source.

914
00:57:22,077 --> 00:57:26,600
I mean, occasionally it was a source of stress in my life.

915
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:29,182
But I think most of the time it was the escape from stress.

916
00:57:29,182 --> 00:57:29,502
Cool, thank you.

917
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,341
I mean, you've spoken really elegantly about the balance

918
00:57:34,341 --> 00:57:37,442
between the artistic and the mechanical sides of the game.

919
00:57:37,442 --> 00:57:40,943
And I thank you so much for explaining so much

920
00:57:40,943 --> 00:57:42,223
of how that's one thing.

921
00:57:42,223 --> 00:57:45,484
But I'm really curious about the technical challenges.

922
00:57:45,484 --> 00:57:47,544
You talk about art being a big motivating factor.

923
00:57:47,544 --> 00:57:49,985
When you zoom in through a scene,

924
00:57:49,985 --> 00:57:53,746
you have this line art style that needs to change to scale.

925
00:57:53,746 --> 00:57:55,206
Did you ever draw a scene that you realized,

926
00:57:55,206 --> 00:57:56,847
oh, I wanted to go a little further and throw away?

927
00:57:56,847 --> 00:57:59,087
Tell a little bit more about the technical challenges.

928
00:57:59,468 --> 00:58:02,371
Okay, there's a question about the tech of the game.

929
00:58:02,371 --> 00:58:06,315
I always considered it simple, so that's why I didn't cover it much.

930
00:58:06,315 --> 00:58:10,040
I mean, it uses parallax layers

931
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:13,684
in a very simple 3D space that the camera moves through.

932
00:58:13,684 --> 00:58:17,508
But if you move from looking at an object from far away

933
00:58:17,508 --> 00:58:19,430
and then you zoom in to look at it closely...

934
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:22,792
Often you're transitioning between two different objects,

935
00:58:22,792 --> 00:58:24,633
two separate drawings of the same object.

936
00:58:24,633 --> 00:58:26,454
So I zoom in on a clock tower,

937
00:58:26,454 --> 00:58:28,175
I'm going from a small drawing of the clock tower

938
00:58:28,175 --> 00:58:29,856
to a large drawing of the clock tower,

939
00:58:29,856 --> 00:58:31,457
not scaling the same drawing.

940
00:58:31,457 --> 00:58:33,017
I'd scale both drawings at once

941
00:58:33,017 --> 00:58:35,579
and then crossfade from one to the other

942
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:40,901
and movement is blurry enough that you often don't see that.

943
00:58:40,901 --> 00:58:43,983
And then that's about it mechanically,

944
00:58:43,983 --> 00:58:46,104
at least for the inside of a tile.

945
00:58:47,008 --> 00:58:51,050
Sure, did you ever find that you had to reorganize your workflow based on changes to how you

946
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:53,932
wanted the scenes to be composited?

947
00:58:53,932 --> 00:59:01,376
Yeah, I mean the workflow was ironed out pretty early on, but yeah, I developed techniques

948
00:59:01,376 --> 00:59:09,901
for how to sort of figure out the home position for an object and what it looks like from

949
00:59:09,901 --> 00:59:11,582
that perspective and then...

950
00:59:12,807 --> 00:59:16,168
and then quickly get to what the object looks like

951
00:59:16,168 --> 00:59:17,848
from another perspective.

952
00:59:17,848 --> 00:59:20,249
It's difficult to describe.

953
00:59:20,249 --> 00:59:24,310
But yeah, there were approaches that I evolved over time

954
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:24,930
for dealing with that.

955
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:25,250
Thanks.

956
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:25,810
Thank you.

957
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:26,450
Last question.

958
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:27,311
This was an amazing talk.

959
00:59:27,311 --> 00:59:34,393
I have a question about the dual nature of all of these things

960
00:59:34,393 --> 00:59:36,753
when you were designing.

961
00:59:38,078 --> 00:59:42,579
It seems like there would be a lot of dependency issues when you're iterating on your design.

962
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:49,341
And I'm wondering what maybe you learned was the greatest dependency?

963
00:59:49,341 --> 00:59:57,084
So when you wanted to scrap a section and improve on it in some way, was it the art?

964
00:59:57,084 --> 01:00:01,165
Was it the design progression?

965
01:00:02,547 --> 01:00:06,549
So yes, everything in the game is dependent on everything else.

966
01:00:06,549 --> 01:00:10,731
And what was the greatest sort of challenge or pain point?

967
01:00:10,731 --> 01:00:16,635
Certainly art, because it was so expensive to produce,

968
01:00:16,635 --> 01:00:18,316
and oftentimes like the, if you

969
01:00:18,316 --> 01:00:21,978
connect two tiles together, the lighting has to match across,

970
01:00:21,978 --> 01:00:27,361
all the colors and lights have to match across the tiles, and maybe one is an exterior

971
01:00:27,361 --> 01:00:31,143
daytime scene, and one is an interior nighttime scene.

972
01:00:31,143 --> 01:00:31,643
And...

973
01:00:32,418 --> 01:00:36,601
if I need to change the puzzle for visual reasons,

974
01:00:36,601 --> 01:00:38,822
that might force the time of day to change

975
01:00:38,822 --> 01:00:40,203
in one of the two scenes,

976
01:00:40,203 --> 01:00:45,185
so that pushes back onto the narrative.

977
01:00:46,165 --> 01:00:48,026
That was a big challenge.

978
01:00:48,026 --> 01:00:51,687
If I'm trying to make a puzzle and I think, oh, this puzzle

979
01:00:51,687 --> 01:00:55,227
needs one more tile to have enough pieces to work,

980
01:00:55,227 --> 01:00:58,888
then that means I have to create a whole life

981
01:00:58,888 --> 01:01:00,449
cycle for that new tile.

982
01:01:00,449 --> 01:01:03,329
I have to create a moment where it was born,

983
01:01:03,329 --> 01:01:06,490
and all the scenes that are inside it, what those scenes

984
01:01:06,490 --> 01:01:09,491
have to do with the story.

985
01:01:09,491 --> 01:01:14,252
And then I have an extra tile around, which means I can't,

986
01:01:14,252 --> 01:01:14,992
and I might.

987
01:01:15,778 --> 01:01:23,162
take up a space that would otherwise be occupied by another tile. And so, just adding one more

988
01:01:23,162 --> 01:01:27,665
piece to a puzzle if it's another tile is like a hugely costly decision that like ripples

989
01:01:27,665 --> 01:01:31,047
forward and backward throughout the whole game.

990
01:01:31,047 --> 01:01:31,967
Great. Thanks.

991
01:01:31,967 --> 01:01:36,370
All right. That's going to wrap things up. Please make sure that you...
