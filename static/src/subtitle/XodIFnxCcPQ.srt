1
00:00:06,245 --> 00:00:10,743
I'm Catherine, and I play a lot of role-playing games.

2
00:00:10,743 --> 00:00:10,803
Yep.

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,203
Give me your dice rolls, stat checks, epic campaigns, fiction-first mechanics, gnarly

4
00:00:16,203 --> 00:00:17,504
character creation.

5
00:00:17,504 --> 00:00:18,024
I am down for that.

6
00:00:18,024 --> 00:00:20,766
I call that a Saturday.

7
00:00:20,766 --> 00:00:25,229
So I have found my gaming home in modern tabletop RPG.

8
00:00:25,229 --> 00:00:31,073
So as a resident of this weird and wonderful country of play, I'm here to help spread the

9
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:36,597
good word of story gaming to all you folks here and see what hard-won lessons of narrative

10
00:00:36,597 --> 00:00:38,918
design we can bridge across formats.

11
00:00:44,838 --> 00:00:47,899
Let's start with introductions, as is only proper.

12
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:50,180
I'm 50% of Thorny Games.

13
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,861
We're an indie game design studio and publishing company

14
00:00:52,861 --> 00:00:55,501
making story-driven tabletop games.

15
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:58,683
Up to this point, our games all revolve around language

16
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,243
in some form or another.

17
00:01:00,243 --> 00:01:02,044
We find language as a subject matter

18
00:01:02,044 --> 00:01:04,545
is a surprisingly effective inroad

19
00:01:04,545 --> 00:01:06,685
to emotionally connecting with players.

20
00:01:06,685 --> 00:01:07,926
In our designs, we try to explore

21
00:01:07,926 --> 00:01:10,507
the deeper side of language and what it means to people,

22
00:01:10,507 --> 00:01:12,427
be it through culture, identity,

23
00:01:12,427 --> 00:01:13,988
or just how we perceive the world.

24
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:17,682
Thankfully, we've had some successes to date.

25
00:01:17,682 --> 00:01:19,603
The community on Kickstarter has been kind to us,

26
00:01:19,603 --> 00:01:22,065
and we've seen kindness also in the form

27
00:01:22,065 --> 00:01:24,027
of some awards and recognition

28
00:01:24,027 --> 00:01:26,809
at places like IndieCade and South by Southwest.

29
00:01:26,809 --> 00:01:28,830
All of this is just to say that we think

30
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,172
there's something powerful in these topics.

31
00:01:31,172 --> 00:01:33,014
It resonates with enough folks for us

32
00:01:33,014 --> 00:01:34,295
to continue to do what we do,

33
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:36,276
and we are stoked to forge ahead.

34
00:01:37,387 --> 00:01:40,730
So, as someone who is passionate about role-playing,

35
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,752
first and foremost, at Thorny Games,

36
00:01:42,752 --> 00:01:45,114
we try to make a habit of crossing barriers

37
00:01:45,114 --> 00:01:47,476
between different gaming communities

38
00:01:47,476 --> 00:01:51,239
and then introduce new players to the excitements

39
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:53,662
of tabletop story gaming.

40
00:01:53,662 --> 00:01:54,723
And that is why I am here.

41
00:01:54,723 --> 00:01:58,606
You may be totally new to tabletop role-playing games.

42
00:01:58,606 --> 00:01:59,467
Great.

43
00:02:00,407 --> 00:02:02,349
Let's talk about what they are.

44
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:05,933
You too may be a deep convert and play them to bits.

45
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:09,436
Also great, let's get mutually excited about them together.

46
00:02:10,404 --> 00:02:14,607
So, tabletop role-playing games are analog games where players focus on telling stories

47
00:02:14,607 --> 00:02:14,987
together.

48
00:02:14,987 --> 00:02:20,131
So, some of these stories are tried and true, like storming a dungeon and looting the treasure,

49
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:24,214
but more and more in the modern scene, they are quite different.

50
00:02:24,214 --> 00:02:29,798
You might be telling the story of the downfall of a civilization with some fatal flaw, building

51
00:02:29,798 --> 00:02:35,242
the language of a people born in isolation, or find yourself as a World War II-era Soviet

52
00:02:35,242 --> 00:02:38,245
airwoman fighting Hitler by night and the patriarchy by day.

53
00:02:39,847 --> 00:02:43,170
Right? Yeah. There's a lot to unpack here.

54
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:49,894
So as digital narrative designers, why should we care? If you're looking for inspiration

55
00:02:49,894 --> 00:02:57,760
off the beaten path, these games are provocative. They're treading innovative ground in design

56
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,043
and telling new stories that many mediums just aren't touching. Games about community,

57
00:03:02,043 --> 00:03:08,588
identity, loss, they're truly pushing the boundaries of what modern gaming is exploring.

58
00:03:11,478 --> 00:03:14,441
Increasingly, the word is also getting out.

59
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:16,622
These games are getting more and more attention.

60
00:03:16,622 --> 00:03:18,924
No longer content to just being on the sidelines

61
00:03:18,924 --> 00:03:22,807
doing their own weird thing, people are talking.

62
00:03:22,807 --> 00:03:25,689
Both for more established games and in the indie setting.

63
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:31,195
So down at Indiecade last year, the jury's prize award winner was a fantastic indie RPG

64
00:03:31,195 --> 00:03:32,917
called Bluebeard's Bride.

65
00:03:32,917 --> 00:03:37,762
One of the creators is in this very room about creeping feminine horror.

66
00:03:37,762 --> 00:03:43,989
So as indie RPGs are breaking through to mainstream recognition, we now regularly see projects

67
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:46,972
on Kickstarter that are raising in the thousands, if not millions.

68
00:03:47,553 --> 00:03:50,655
And so, right now, this is a bid for all of us

69
00:03:50,655 --> 00:03:54,337
to be on that edge and to learn from the narrative design

70
00:03:54,337 --> 00:03:57,178
challenges and insights that these games have had.

71
00:03:57,178 --> 00:04:03,162
But before we start talking about the avant-garde

72
00:04:03,162 --> 00:04:06,063
of tabletop role-playing, we should

73
00:04:06,063 --> 00:04:07,524
establish the mainstream.

74
00:04:08,392 --> 00:04:13,917
The most common example of a tabletop RPG is, of course, Dungeons & Dragons.

75
00:04:13,917 --> 00:04:19,923
In D&D, players each create and then embody characters on an adventure, usually revolving

76
00:04:19,923 --> 00:04:22,305
around overcoming various challenges through combat.

77
00:04:22,815 --> 00:04:27,820
as they adventure, they get better at what they do and they increase their various stats,

78
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:32,685
which might make them great at magic or swordsmanship or inspirational singing or something.

79
00:04:32,685 --> 00:04:38,971
The narrative itself is a collaboration between players and one very special player called

80
00:04:38,971 --> 00:04:42,074
the game master, though not in a totally equitable style.

81
00:04:43,095 --> 00:04:46,336
Players will control the actions of their characters

82
00:04:46,336 --> 00:04:48,517
and roll dice to determine their success,

83
00:04:48,517 --> 00:04:51,238
but everything else comes from the game master.

84
00:04:51,238 --> 00:04:53,859
So determining what the characters encounter,

85
00:04:53,859 --> 00:04:54,780
who needs their help,

86
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,841
how difficult the challenges they face are,

87
00:04:56,841 --> 00:04:58,942
the GM introduces all of these during play

88
00:04:58,942 --> 00:05:00,622
by describing what the characters see,

89
00:05:00,622 --> 00:05:01,843
what the players see,

90
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,464
and sense as they move through the world

91
00:05:03,464 --> 00:05:04,324
that's been created.

92
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:08,200
So RPGs as a whole are undergoing a huge surge

93
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,341
in popularity right now.

94
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:11,643
The fifth edition of Dungeons and Dragons

95
00:05:11,643 --> 00:05:14,226
really nailed popularizing and making the game

96
00:05:14,226 --> 00:05:15,547
much more accessible.

97
00:05:15,547 --> 00:05:19,070
And recorded play and streaming are just going bananas.

98
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,992
It's a time of feast.

99
00:05:20,992 --> 00:05:21,032
So.

100
00:05:24,727 --> 00:05:29,088
We've named the established stalwarts of the genre.

101
00:05:29,088 --> 00:05:32,169
Let's talk about the indie side of tabletop role playing.

102
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:35,210
These are games that are primarily focused

103
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,650
on the narrative experience of the players

104
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,891
rather than overcoming strategic or tactical challenges.

105
00:05:41,812 --> 00:05:43,453
That's different from Dungeons and Dragons,

106
00:05:43,453 --> 00:05:45,734
where most mechanics revolve around combat,

107
00:05:45,734 --> 00:05:47,895
and the job of weaving a narrative around them

108
00:05:47,895 --> 00:05:51,638
is typically done outside of the core system of the game.

109
00:05:51,638 --> 00:05:56,361
Alternatively, indie RPGs often lean into this fiction.

110
00:05:56,361 --> 00:05:58,422
So generally, they're not about winning or losing,

111
00:05:58,422 --> 00:06:01,744
though of course, every rule has exceptions.

112
00:06:01,744 --> 00:06:03,465
In a challenge-based game like D&D,

113
00:06:03,465 --> 00:06:05,387
there kind of needs to be a loss condition

114
00:06:05,387 --> 00:06:08,929
so that the challenges that form the focus of play

115
00:06:08,929 --> 00:06:09,770
are meaningful.

116
00:06:10,843 --> 00:06:13,904
But in most indie RPGs, standing up and failing a challenge

117
00:06:13,904 --> 00:06:16,666
might be just as impactful in a character's narrative arc

118
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,367
as success would be, and therefore

119
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,847
can be just as satisfying.

120
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:24,270
So for story games, the mantra is often play to find out.

121
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,551
Rather than aiming to win with a capital W,

122
00:06:26,551 --> 00:06:30,072
you're here to find out how the story naturally evolves

123
00:06:30,072 --> 00:06:32,574
according to all of the tinder that we've brought

124
00:06:32,574 --> 00:06:34,515
and lit together as people at the table.

125
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,543
So counter-intuitively, even though they're called role-playing games,

126
00:06:39,543 --> 00:06:43,866
embodying a character, totally not necessary as a defining component.

127
00:06:43,866 --> 00:06:46,509
Many folks prefer the term story games.

128
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:48,971
There may be no characters explicitly defined.

129
00:06:48,971 --> 00:06:50,972
We may share control of a single character.

130
00:06:50,972 --> 00:06:53,234
These games contain multitudes.

131
00:06:57,019 --> 00:07:02,660
So I've said that the mechanics should drive a narrative experience in a story game,

132
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,021
that the fiction should come first.

133
00:07:05,021 --> 00:07:07,321
So let's ground this in an example.

134
00:07:07,321 --> 00:07:11,762
Here is a slice of the rule set from Apocalypse World,

135
00:07:11,762 --> 00:07:16,443
a fantastic game about life in the post-apocalypse by Vincent and Miguel Baker.

136
00:07:16,443 --> 00:07:19,764
It is also one of the most widely known indie RPGs today.

137
00:07:20,702 --> 00:07:24,484
So in Apocalypse World, the MC, Master of Ceremonies,

138
00:07:24,484 --> 00:07:26,585
kind of an analog of the game Master,

139
00:07:26,585 --> 00:07:30,067
is encouraged to do as little prep as possible

140
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:31,168
before the game starts,

141
00:07:31,168 --> 00:07:33,849
and then develop the narrative collaboratively

142
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:34,510
with the players.

143
00:07:35,896 --> 00:07:43,103
In this example, this move is triggered when a character attempts to read a charged situation,

144
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:46,406
and the answers to the question all help drive the narrative forward.

145
00:07:46,406 --> 00:07:50,310
So the reason that this is different than something like rolling a perception check,

146
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:53,753
say, in a more traditional RPG, is that the MC probably...

147
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:57,074
hasn't started the game with any answers

148
00:07:57,074 --> 00:07:58,855
to any of these questions,

149
00:07:58,855 --> 00:08:00,635
and will be establishing new fiction

150
00:08:00,635 --> 00:08:02,415
in response to the question.

151
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,436
So through the question and answer,

152
00:08:04,436 --> 00:08:07,337
a significant new piece of the narrative is born.

153
00:08:07,337 --> 00:08:11,518
Ultimately, it's the system that adds to the narrative.

154
00:08:11,518 --> 00:08:15,459
The player has established how things became charged,

155
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:17,399
and then the MC responded to the move

156
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,259
by providing an immediate threat.

157
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:20,360
Suddenly, we have a game.

158
00:08:24,688 --> 00:08:28,209
So full stop here for some healthy wordings.

159
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:30,989
When you recount trends in history,

160
00:08:30,989 --> 00:08:33,210
there's much that is dramatically incomplete,

161
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,831
and that is also true of this telling.

162
00:08:35,831 --> 00:08:37,611
All of this is offered to you as a taste

163
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:39,492
in anticipation of future conversation and play.

164
00:08:39,492 --> 00:08:40,072
So take this generously.

165
00:08:40,072 --> 00:08:41,672
Let's place our focus in the modern era for these games.

166
00:08:52,593 --> 00:08:55,554
Many of the tabletop RPGs that are most widely known,

167
00:08:55,554 --> 00:08:58,036
Dungeons and Dragons, Call of Cthulhu, Pathfinder,

168
00:08:58,036 --> 00:09:00,237
they actually have their roots in games

169
00:09:00,237 --> 00:09:00,797
that are decades old.

170
00:09:00,797 --> 00:09:04,939
So even though they've gone through dramatic iteration,

171
00:09:04,939 --> 00:09:07,100
significant dramatic iteration,

172
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,141
the core focus of the game

173
00:09:08,141 --> 00:09:10,922
and what it tells the players to care about

174
00:09:10,922 --> 00:09:12,583
has been essentially untouched.

175
00:09:13,224 --> 00:09:19,207
So Traveler is a wonderful example of sort of more traditional design that has some really

176
00:09:19,207 --> 00:09:24,490
interesting ideas about mechanizing the story of a character through character creation,

177
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:30,354
through something called life paths. And it probably goes down into history as one of the

178
00:09:30,354 --> 00:09:34,556
only well-known games where you can die as a character as you create them. Interesting.

179
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,424
So as a focus of study, we'll talk about

180
00:09:41,424 --> 00:09:43,725
a more modern brand of RPG.

181
00:09:43,725 --> 00:09:47,647
So we'll root ourselves in the glorious 90s aughts and tens

182
00:09:47,647 --> 00:09:49,608
that gave us games like Fiasco,

183
00:09:49,608 --> 00:09:52,769
where you relive a Coen Brothers-esque catastrophe

184
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:56,890
during play, Microscope, where you tell a story

185
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:59,591
of fractal histories using nothing but index cards

186
00:09:59,591 --> 00:10:02,112
at the table, or The Quiet Year,

187
00:10:02,112 --> 00:10:04,393
a map building game about community,

188
00:10:04,393 --> 00:10:05,974
along with very many others.

189
00:10:11,682 --> 00:10:17,546
So story games are tremendously useful as case studies for narrative design for a number of reasons.

190
00:10:17,546 --> 00:10:22,110
For one, they're forced to wear their design choices on their sleeves

191
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,793
because they need to be run by the players at the table.

192
00:10:26,505 --> 00:10:29,867
So if a GM is facilitating a game, it can really help

193
00:10:29,867 --> 00:10:32,048
if they have some unobstructed view

194
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,189
of the designer's intentions.

195
00:10:33,189 --> 00:10:34,990
Then they can lean into them.

196
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:39,232
That's why the books of these games are often very candid

197
00:10:39,232 --> 00:10:40,893
in the decisions gone into design

198
00:10:40,893 --> 00:10:43,314
and what their fundamental intent is.

199
00:10:43,314 --> 00:10:46,976
So design discussion also has been very public

200
00:10:46,976 --> 00:10:49,917
through a variety of well-trod online forums,

201
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:52,639
one of which is sadly disappearing in a week.

202
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:53,539
Goodbye, Google+.

203
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:57,511
They've traditionally been the projects

204
00:10:57,511 --> 00:11:00,233
of highly passionate folks who love really nothing more

205
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:03,035
than getting into long-winded forum discussions

206
00:11:03,035 --> 00:11:05,136
or dissecting different types of narrative play.

207
00:11:05,136 --> 00:11:09,359
And finally, they iterate super quickly.

208
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:11,681
Take Apocalypse World, which was released in 2010,

209
00:11:11,681 --> 00:11:14,683
and has already spawned countless variant systems.

210
00:11:14,683 --> 00:11:17,065
These games are said to be powered by the apocalypse.

211
00:11:20,327 --> 00:11:24,029
In the main online repository hosted on the Apocalypse World website,

212
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:27,550
you can find hundreds of Powered by the Apocalypse games,

213
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:30,571
many of them bending the established systems and taking them

214
00:11:30,571 --> 00:11:31,731
in completely novel and fascinating ways.

215
00:11:31,731 --> 00:11:33,032
So let's highlight some ideas that we can

216
00:11:33,032 --> 00:11:34,532
consider from modern indie role-playing games.

217
00:11:46,223 --> 00:11:49,305
I'll introduce a concept that's been explored

218
00:11:49,305 --> 00:11:51,766
in recent story games and offer you a question

219
00:11:51,766 --> 00:11:57,330
that this concept raises for narrative design as a whole.

220
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:03,634
Let's start with a topic in modern story game design

221
00:12:03,634 --> 00:12:06,716
that's everywhere and that everyone has an opinion about,

222
00:12:06,716 --> 00:12:08,837
and that is the role of the GM,

223
00:12:08,837 --> 00:12:10,879
the person who has traditionally shepherded

224
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,540
the entire narrative experience.

225
00:12:15,882 --> 00:12:20,464
So historically, tabletop RPGs viewed the game master

226
00:12:20,464 --> 00:12:23,065
as an ultimate authority.

227
00:12:23,065 --> 00:12:26,446
It's not unusual to hear them use terms like my game

228
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:29,528
and my players with a sense of ownership.

229
00:12:29,528 --> 00:12:32,409
They were in charge of making play, world building,

230
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:33,989
and honestly, really the vast majority

231
00:12:33,989 --> 00:12:35,610
of the experience at the table.

232
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:39,322
While the players controlled their individual characters,

233
00:12:39,322 --> 00:12:42,024
the GM gets to build worlds, write histories,

234
00:12:42,024 --> 00:12:44,965
place props and objects when narratively convenient.

235
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:48,907
They had special authority within the mechanics of the game

236
00:12:48,907 --> 00:12:51,609
and then were generally the source of antagonism,

237
00:12:51,609 --> 00:12:53,270
conflict, and plot for everybody.

238
00:12:54,527 --> 00:12:58,890
So in many ways, the GM role, as separate and apart,

239
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:02,092
has been nurtured by many components of the game systems

240
00:13:02,092 --> 00:13:03,993
themselves.

241
00:13:03,993 --> 00:13:07,215
GMs have different books full of different content,

242
00:13:07,215 --> 00:13:09,977
even though they operated with the same basic system

243
00:13:09,977 --> 00:13:11,298
rules as players.

244
00:13:11,298 --> 00:13:13,440
They had scripted module players.

245
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,841
They had scripted modules that players

246
00:13:14,841 --> 00:13:16,342
weren't allowed to look at.

247
00:13:16,342 --> 00:13:18,984
And they even had a physical barrier between them

248
00:13:18,984 --> 00:13:20,084
and the rest of the table.

249
00:13:21,148 --> 00:13:27,412
When you think about tabletop RPGs, this is probably the image that springs to mind.

250
00:13:27,412 --> 00:13:34,477
But story games have been blowing this assumption wide, wide open for a long time.

251
00:13:34,477 --> 00:13:35,258
Let's talk about that.

252
00:13:37,834 --> 00:13:40,136
So let's take Fiasco as an example.

253
00:13:40,136 --> 00:13:44,020
This game is all about setting players as characters

254
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,082
in a complicated, interwoven caper

255
00:13:47,082 --> 00:13:49,344
where everything goes to shit very quickly.

256
00:13:49,344 --> 00:13:53,288
The tagline is ordinary people with powerful ambition

257
00:13:53,288 --> 00:13:55,189
and very poor impulse control.

258
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:57,591
This is a fantastic game.

259
00:13:58,472 --> 00:14:00,373
The game begins by setting up relationships

260
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:05,356
between characters using cards in its newest iteration,

261
00:14:05,356 --> 00:14:07,197
or dice in the classic form,

262
00:14:07,197 --> 00:14:09,018
along with other plot elements

263
00:14:09,018 --> 00:14:10,719
that will be part of the story.

264
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:14,001
So, glossing over the overall structure,

265
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:16,463
but essentially, in each turn,

266
00:14:16,463 --> 00:14:19,805
a player will set a scene with some subset

267
00:14:19,805 --> 00:14:21,486
of the other players at the table

268
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,607
to develop on some thorny situation

269
00:14:23,607 --> 00:14:25,188
that they were originally put in.

270
00:14:25,188 --> 00:14:26,529
Maybe they need someone beaten up.

271
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:30,610
Maybe their cousin is a bookie and they can help them out.

272
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,151
You get it.

273
00:14:31,151 --> 00:14:35,112
As the scene reaches a climactic point,

274
00:14:35,112 --> 00:14:37,713
the players at the table not in the scene

275
00:14:37,713 --> 00:14:38,994
determine if things go well

276
00:14:38,994 --> 00:14:43,415
or if indeed they go very poorly for the active players.

277
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:46,296
The active players will then use that prompt

278
00:14:46,296 --> 00:14:48,397
to resolve the tension of the scene.

279
00:14:52,948 --> 00:14:59,978
So, from the example of fiasco, I think that we can see that there actually wasn't a whole

280
00:14:59,978 --> 00:15:05,506
lot about the narrative authority being vested in a single party that was fundamental to

281
00:15:05,506 --> 00:15:05,907
the form.

282
00:15:07,387 --> 00:15:11,149
In fiasco, the role of the GM is spread dynamically

283
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:12,730
among everyone at the table.

284
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,471
Depending on how you look at it,

285
00:15:14,471 --> 00:15:17,974
you might say that this means that there are either no GMs,

286
00:15:17,974 --> 00:15:19,795
leading to the term GM-less,

287
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:23,277
or perhaps that everyone is a GM in this case,

288
00:15:23,277 --> 00:15:25,399
giving us the term GM-full,

289
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:28,181
and the paradox being that both of these terms

290
00:15:28,181 --> 00:15:29,582
end up meaning very similar things.

291
00:15:29,582 --> 00:15:35,566
So with fiasco, this distribution of narrative authority

292
00:15:35,566 --> 00:15:36,466
is done mechanically.

293
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,905
But this is by no means the only way

294
00:15:40,905 --> 00:15:43,428
of splitting narrative authority and how it can be handled.

295
00:15:43,428 --> 00:15:48,595
So another great example of this is the game 1,001 Nights

296
00:15:48,595 --> 00:15:50,998
by McGay Baker, where players each

297
00:15:50,998 --> 00:15:54,402
improvised tales in the style of Scheherazade's 1,001 Arabian

298
00:15:54,402 --> 00:15:54,723
Nights.

299
00:15:55,864 --> 00:15:58,806
So here, gameplay is split between the present day,

300
00:15:58,806 --> 00:16:01,228
you are members of an Arabian court,

301
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:04,251
going about your daily lives, and its intrigues,

302
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:08,654
and the various stories that you use to connect with others.

303
00:16:08,654 --> 00:16:13,978
So when telling a story, usually to expand on juicy points

304
00:16:13,978 --> 00:16:17,681
that came up in court, the players will start to improvise

305
00:16:17,681 --> 00:16:19,162
in the style of A Thousand and One Nights.

306
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:23,245
and when they need to introduce a totally new character for their story,

307
00:16:23,245 --> 00:16:27,267
they'll recruit another court character to play the role.

308
00:16:27,267 --> 00:16:33,711
Then this recruited player has narrative authority over that part of the story.

309
00:16:33,711 --> 00:16:38,614
So in A Thousand and One Nights, narrative control flows from the fiction itself

310
00:16:38,614 --> 00:16:42,896
rather than being heavily mechanized, which is a nice distinction between it and fiasco.

311
00:16:47,638 --> 00:16:53,866
Another way in which games have sought to do away with the role of GM has been to carve

312
00:16:53,866 --> 00:16:58,052
it up and distribute discrete chunks of it to players explicitly.

313
00:16:58,052 --> 00:17:03,379
So two games that split narrative authority in this way are Downfall and Archipelago.

314
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:10,974
by Caroline Hobbs tells a story about the fall of a culture

315
00:17:10,974 --> 00:17:13,254
that we create during the game that ends up

316
00:17:13,254 --> 00:17:15,995
succumbing to its fatal flaws.

317
00:17:15,995 --> 00:17:17,695
It does this by splitting authority

318
00:17:17,695 --> 00:17:21,056
over players who control the roles of the hero, the pillar,

319
00:17:21,056 --> 00:17:24,317
and the fallen, who then each push and pull each other

320
00:17:24,317 --> 00:17:27,038
by representing different elements of the society.

321
00:17:27,718 --> 00:17:30,059
So in a scene, in each scene,

322
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:32,540
the hero tries to save the world, naturally,

323
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,641
the fallen tries to corrupt it,

324
00:17:34,641 --> 00:17:36,661
and the pillar, an average person,

325
00:17:36,661 --> 00:17:39,643
tries to stifle change, maintain status quo.

326
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:43,364
Every two scenes, roles rotate,

327
00:17:43,364 --> 00:17:46,365
and that allows each player to embody all of the roles

328
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:47,386
over the course of the game.

329
00:17:47,386 --> 00:17:50,847
Each role also comes with certain mechanical responsibilities

330
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:53,088
like framing scenes, which again,

331
00:17:53,088 --> 00:17:55,209
effectively carve up the GM's traditional role.

332
00:17:57,807 --> 00:18:03,244
Archipelago is another great example that experiments with narrative control through

333
00:18:03,244 --> 00:18:04,287
a few different mechanics.

334
00:18:05,654 --> 00:18:11,436
Important narrative license and environmental themes are divided among the players themselves.

335
00:18:11,436 --> 00:18:16,798
So for example, if we're playing a game in a sailing boat traversing the Pacific, one

336
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:21,019
player may control the elements of the weather or the ship.

337
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:26,701
And whenever uncertainty is raised about that element, you will have authority over what

338
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:27,241
happens.

339
00:18:27,942 --> 00:18:32,984
It also intersperses that with moments of narrative surprise by employing these really

340
00:18:32,984 --> 00:18:39,468
neat things called ritual phrases that players can use to prompt one another to change things.

341
00:18:39,468 --> 00:18:44,711
So for example, you can use a card like, that might not be quite so easy to signal that

342
00:18:44,711 --> 00:18:47,212
you want to ramp up an answer and go another way.

343
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:56,192
All of this stems from sort of a core principle that's prevalent in the story gaming design

344
00:18:56,192 --> 00:18:59,575
language that's called the SEGA principle.

345
00:18:59,575 --> 00:19:04,639
It states that when one person is the author of both the character's adversity and its

346
00:19:04,639 --> 00:19:06,940
resolution, play is not fun.

347
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:13,192
So all of these examples give us ways to distribute that work between players

348
00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:16,473
to make sure that even when narrative authority is split,

349
00:19:16,473 --> 00:19:20,395
there isn't a player just stuck in a loop answering their own questions.

350
00:19:26,252 --> 00:19:29,514
So finally, we can ask ourselves,

351
00:19:29,514 --> 00:19:33,295
with all of these games distributing narrative control

352
00:19:33,295 --> 00:19:35,736
in interesting ways, where does that necessarily

353
00:19:35,736 --> 00:19:38,778
lie within your medium, with my medium?

354
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:41,739
Who provides adversity, and what does that come from,

355
00:19:41,739 --> 00:19:43,400
or where does that come from in a game?

356
00:19:44,836 --> 00:19:49,461
If your default is to consider that it should come from the system the players are engaging

357
00:19:49,461 --> 00:19:51,603
with, maybe it's time to challenge that.

358
00:19:51,603 --> 00:19:56,769
You may be able to introduce more distribution and narrative authority than you think, and

359
00:19:56,769 --> 00:20:00,773
in doing so you can give players much more agency over the things that they want to explore.

360
00:20:01,474 --> 00:20:04,155
So who has control of what goes past,

361
00:20:04,155 --> 00:20:07,637
just who unfolds the next narrative beat,

362
00:20:07,637 --> 00:20:09,919
but also fundamentally what topic

363
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:10,980
someone wants to engage with.

364
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:16,303
And it really ensures that players can investigate

365
00:20:16,303 --> 00:20:18,204
the themes that they enthusiastically want to.

366
00:20:18,204 --> 00:20:20,586
These choices inform the themes

367
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:23,207
that ultimately define the narrative,

368
00:20:23,207 --> 00:20:25,048
so that it's not tied to the fiat

369
00:20:25,048 --> 00:20:26,850
of one single creative authority.

370
00:20:28,403 --> 00:20:31,424
So, I offer you this question.

371
00:20:31,424 --> 00:20:32,445
Who is in charge here?

372
00:20:32,445 --> 00:20:35,326
Another concept that I'd like to offer is something called the fruitful void, which

373
00:20:35,326 --> 00:20:40,748
has really helped me structure thoughts around narratives in the past.

374
00:20:40,748 --> 00:20:53,194
It has its origins from some of the community discussion boards in the 90s and has since

375
00:20:53,194 --> 00:20:56,775
become entrenched in the design language across the whole discipline.

376
00:21:00,472 --> 00:21:06,096
Dogs in the Vineyard, I'm giving you lots of good recs today, is a game by Vincent Baker

377
00:21:06,096 --> 00:21:09,900
based on a West that never quite was.

378
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:14,824
It's a jams game and players are God's watchdogs, or just dogs.

379
00:21:14,824 --> 00:21:19,748
And as part of their duties, they travel from city to city delivering the mail, helping

380
00:21:19,748 --> 00:21:23,411
out with community functions and also, of course, enforcing judgments of the true faith

381
00:21:23,411 --> 00:21:25,073
of the king of life, as you do.

382
00:21:26,153 --> 00:21:31,579
So Vincent Baker once published this image on his blog,

383
00:21:31,579 --> 00:21:34,822
and all of the arrows are mechanics in the game.

384
00:21:34,822 --> 00:21:37,785
You don't need to know what they represent specifically in the game,

385
00:21:37,785 --> 00:21:40,968
but just to know that he stated that what was in the whirlwind itself

386
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:43,190
was what the game was actually about,

387
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:45,432
what those mechanics are pointing towards.

388
00:21:49,461 --> 00:21:55,767
This concept of the real meat in your game being about what isn't mechanized has been

389
00:21:55,767 --> 00:21:56,969
formalized many times.

390
00:21:56,969 --> 00:22:04,837
So for example, My Life with Master, this is a game about roleplaying as minions of

391
00:22:04,837 --> 00:22:07,880
this powerful master or mistress.

392
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,864
It mechanized stats like wariness and self-loathing.

393
00:22:12,485 --> 00:22:14,832
but it never talks about defiance,

394
00:22:14,832 --> 00:22:17,239
even though that's what all the mechanics in the game

395
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:19,506
are hurling at the player to think about.

396
00:22:21,372 --> 00:22:25,394
So similarly, part of Emily Kierboss' romance trilogy,

397
00:22:25,394 --> 00:22:29,256
Breaking the Ice, is a great, great game for two people

398
00:22:29,256 --> 00:22:31,557
who play characters over the course of three dates,

399
00:22:31,557 --> 00:22:33,238
hopefully to find love.

400
00:22:33,238 --> 00:22:36,539
And the game mechanizes things like attraction

401
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:40,801
and compatibility, but as Emily says right here,

402
00:22:40,801 --> 00:22:43,682
thinking about mechanizing the moment of falling in love

403
00:22:43,682 --> 00:22:44,343
is just silly.

404
00:22:44,343 --> 00:22:48,104
So she described the fruitful void of that game

405
00:22:48,104 --> 00:22:49,825
as being love and vulnerability.

406
00:22:53,443 --> 00:22:57,465
So when designing the mechanics around the emotional impact

407
00:22:57,465 --> 00:23:00,666
and narrative arc that you want the players to have,

408
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:03,688
consider what it is and isn't,

409
00:23:03,688 --> 00:23:06,549
and what is explicitly mechanized.

410
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:09,050
So what's nailed down and what are the mechanics

411
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:11,851
swirling around and throwing into question?

412
00:23:11,851 --> 00:23:15,092
If you have an explicit system that measures the morality,

413
00:23:15,092 --> 00:23:16,853
say, of the player's actions,

414
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:19,034
how would that change the player's reaction to it?

415
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:25,965
And if your system really is about morality, how can you add force behind those pinwheels

416
00:23:25,965 --> 00:23:27,007
causing it to twist and turn?

417
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,415
Now I offer you a final concept.

418
00:23:33,415 --> 00:23:36,558
Artifacts of play.

419
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:38,620
So these are side products of play

420
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,561
that exist in the physical world,

421
00:23:40,561 --> 00:23:42,863
the one that we occupy as humans.

422
00:23:42,863 --> 00:23:46,906
These can really help increase the emotional resonance

423
00:23:46,906 --> 00:23:49,849
of a narrative that the players experience in game

424
00:23:49,849 --> 00:23:52,471
by bridging the physical world that they live in

425
00:23:52,471 --> 00:23:55,314
and then the imaginary one that they occupy in play.

426
00:23:55,314 --> 00:23:57,656
So these artifacts live past the game.

427
00:23:59,212 --> 00:24:01,334
Familiar cases of this in the digital context

428
00:24:01,334 --> 00:24:04,095
may be stuff like automatically generated tweets

429
00:24:04,095 --> 00:24:07,557
based on cute words that are used in word games

430
00:24:07,557 --> 00:24:10,058
that are funny even if you're not actively playing the game

431
00:24:10,058 --> 00:24:12,279
or some of the pictures that you could take

432
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:14,000
and keep in Firewatch.

433
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,662
So story games have been experimenting

434
00:24:16,662 --> 00:24:19,623
with these for a while and they can pack a good punch.

435
00:24:21,987 --> 00:24:26,715
One example is from The Quiet Year by Avery Alder.

436
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:30,341
So Avery Alder's game about telling the story

437
00:24:30,341 --> 00:24:33,687
of a single quiet year experienced by a community

438
00:24:33,687 --> 00:24:35,310
before the jackals return.

439
00:24:36,317 --> 00:24:39,377
So every turn the active player turns over a card,

440
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:43,098
which then asks them to answer one of two questions

441
00:24:43,098 --> 00:24:45,098
about what is happening to the community.

442
00:24:45,098 --> 00:24:46,939
They then get to take an action of their choice

443
00:24:46,939 --> 00:24:50,479
to help address the challenges that the community is facing.

444
00:24:50,479 --> 00:24:54,040
So a completely brilliant part about this game

445
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,121
is how these changes are all reflected on a map

446
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:58,981
that the players are collaboratively drawing

447
00:24:58,981 --> 00:25:00,341
and creating during play.

448
00:25:00,341 --> 00:25:01,782
So you create the map.

449
00:25:01,782 --> 00:25:04,462
It's a game of cartography and storytelling.

450
00:25:05,803 --> 00:25:09,486
This map exists in the physical space

451
00:25:09,486 --> 00:25:13,270
and that the players occupy as human beings

452
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,592
so that you can touch it, you can fold it,

453
00:25:15,592 --> 00:25:17,594
doodle on it, interact with it.

454
00:25:17,594 --> 00:25:19,416
But having this physical artifact

455
00:25:19,416 --> 00:25:23,540
really bridges the worlds, the one within the narrative

456
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,902
and the one that the players live in as humans.

457
00:25:25,902 --> 00:25:27,343
It becomes also a living record

458
00:25:27,343 --> 00:25:30,086
of this particular instance of the game.

459
00:25:32,265 --> 00:25:37,011
For a second example, I offer one of our games

460
00:25:37,011 --> 00:25:40,055
to reinforce that artifacts don't necessarily

461
00:25:40,055 --> 00:25:42,618
have to be physical.

462
00:25:42,618 --> 00:25:46,803
In dialect, players tell the story of an isolated community

463
00:25:46,803 --> 00:25:50,688
by building their language over the course of play.

464
00:25:50,688 --> 00:25:51,169
I will explain.

465
00:25:53,871 --> 00:26:02,734
In every turn of dialect, players add to the story of the isolation while simultaneously modifying the language.

466
00:26:02,734 --> 00:26:09,116
So in each turn, players define new words for their community and start using them as they roleplay members of the isolation.

467
00:26:09,856 --> 00:26:15,520
that means that they gain fluency in their own dialect as the game progresses.

468
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,883
So things happen to the community, language shifts, and becomes more layered to reflect it.

469
00:26:19,883 --> 00:26:25,807
And so in doing so, players discover the essence of these people that they're creating together,

470
00:26:25,807 --> 00:26:30,891
and the dialect they make becomes a language map, say, of what has happened to them.

471
00:26:32,654 --> 00:26:39,357
The language that you create in dialect is definitely an artifact of play.

472
00:26:39,357 --> 00:26:44,879
But why does this enhance the narrative experience the game tells about the language itself?

473
00:26:44,879 --> 00:26:50,101
So every game centers upon the entire life cycle of the language.

474
00:26:50,101 --> 00:26:53,522
It starts from its birth all the way to its eventual demise.

475
00:26:53,522 --> 00:26:58,845
The story experienced in the narrative is actually paralleled by the experience that

476
00:26:58,845 --> 00:27:00,405
the players have at the table.

477
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:05,984
So the language that they're speaking together is born as the language of the isolation.

478
00:27:05,984 --> 00:27:11,647
But when the isolation's language is lost, or you stop playing this game, the players

479
00:27:11,647 --> 00:27:16,550
find themselves also as the sole speakers of this dialect that they just created.

480
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,171
So they too will go through this process.

481
00:27:19,508 --> 00:27:22,131
It's by blurring the line between what is real

482
00:27:22,131 --> 00:27:25,373
and what exists in the game, in this case the language,

483
00:27:25,373 --> 00:27:28,036
that we can mirror an experience the characters have,

484
00:27:28,036 --> 00:27:29,517
the death of their language,

485
00:27:29,517 --> 00:27:31,799
with one, the player's experience,

486
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:34,541
abruptly losing their language that they've been speaking in

487
00:27:34,541 --> 00:27:35,942
for the last three hours.

488
00:27:35,942 --> 00:27:39,065
That is a powerful connection to be left with.

489
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:49,673
So I ask, what can you build during play that lasts beyond the game?

490
00:27:49,673 --> 00:27:54,596
Consider whether or not the experience that your players have as characters can be mirrored

491
00:27:54,596 --> 00:27:57,578
as a real experience that your players have as humans.

492
00:27:57,578 --> 00:28:00,620
Can you share elements between the two?

493
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:04,642
And if so, you may find that the narrative hits home and packs a punch at a deeper and

494
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:05,403
much more genuine level.

495
00:28:09,155 --> 00:28:12,295
Our time here is short, and so I leave you

496
00:28:12,295 --> 00:28:15,796
with these concepts and questions,

497
00:28:15,796 --> 00:28:20,477
a small slice of the ground that indie RPGs are breaking.

498
00:28:20,477 --> 00:28:23,538
There's lots that narrative design across all mediums

499
00:28:23,538 --> 00:28:25,859
can learn from this incredible game space

500
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:28,359
in order to tell deeper and more resonating stories.

501
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:32,720
The only thing left to do is to go out there and play them.

502
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:32,860
Do it.

503
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,541
Thanks a bunch.

504
00:28:34,541 --> 00:28:36,021
Thank you.

505
00:28:36,021 --> 00:28:36,801
Thank you.

506
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,061
I think we have two minutes for questions.

507
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:48,501
Thanks a lot.

508
00:28:48,501 --> 00:28:49,401
I never played Fiasco, so I will definitely try it.

509
00:28:49,401 --> 00:28:50,181
I want to come back on the Game Master position,

510
00:28:50,181 --> 00:28:50,781
because like you said in the preview,

511
00:28:50,781 --> 00:28:51,482
the first tabletop RPG, it was too much.

512
00:29:11,764 --> 00:29:13,746
I would say impact on the game master itself.

513
00:29:13,746 --> 00:29:15,668
So if it was a bad game master or player,

514
00:29:15,668 --> 00:29:17,390
it can be under the fault of the player expense.

515
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:20,454
So now you show example where we are splitting

516
00:29:20,454 --> 00:29:22,075
the responsibility between the player

517
00:29:22,075 --> 00:29:24,298
or putting it on game mechanics.

518
00:29:24,298 --> 00:29:28,362
Do you think that using personal assistant or AI types

519
00:29:28,362 --> 00:29:32,607
like Amazon Alexa can be also some way of using the game

520
00:29:32,607 --> 00:29:33,488
master and replacing it?

521
00:29:34,421 --> 00:29:36,402
Could you repeat the question one more time?

522
00:29:36,402 --> 00:29:42,026
Yes, so do you think that using AI type like Amazon Alexa,

523
00:29:42,026 --> 00:29:44,568
personal assistant, and machine learning

524
00:29:44,568 --> 00:29:47,990
can be also a way to put the game master

525
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,871
out of player's position?

526
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:50,732
I certainly would hope so.

527
00:29:50,732 --> 00:29:53,854
And I would challenge everyone here to think about that

528
00:29:53,854 --> 00:29:56,296
because I think that there are big returns for doing so.

529
00:29:56,296 --> 00:29:56,876
Yeah. Thank you.

530
00:29:56,876 --> 00:30:01,559
Hey, I wanted to know how you feel about emerging narratives

531
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:03,981
and games that promote them, simulate them.

532
00:30:05,302 --> 00:30:06,243
Games like what? I'm sorry.

533
00:30:06,243 --> 00:30:10,225
That allow these emergent narratives to blossom.

534
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:13,647
I am enthusiastic about them, as you can imagine.

535
00:30:13,647 --> 00:30:14,928
Any favorites you have?

536
00:30:14,928 --> 00:30:16,489
Huh? I'm sorry?

537
00:30:16,489 --> 00:30:18,010
Any favorites that you have?

538
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:24,874
It's so hard to choose, but at least in the world that I live in, in tabletop RPG, they are everywhere.

539
00:30:24,874 --> 00:30:27,376
Emergent narratives are the name of the game.

540
00:30:27,376 --> 00:30:27,896
Okay, thank you.

541
00:30:27,896 --> 00:30:28,817
Thank you.

542
00:30:32,204 --> 00:30:33,710
I think we are officially at time.

543
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:37,203
I'm happy to answer questions outside.

544
00:30:37,203 --> 00:30:38,608
Thank you so much for coming.
