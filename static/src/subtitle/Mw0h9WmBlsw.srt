1
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,190
That would be great.

2
00:00:04,791 --> 00:00:07,651
OK, so my name is Mariel Cartwright.

3
00:00:07,852 --> 00:00:10,132
I am the lead animator of Skullgirls.

4
00:00:10,952 --> 00:00:15,134
And welcome to my very first talk,

5
00:00:15,214 --> 00:00:17,875
Fluid and Powerful Animation Within Frame Restrictions.

6
00:00:18,835 --> 00:00:19,755
I was just curious.

7
00:00:19,815 --> 00:00:23,296
I know Jaleel did the who here is an animator thing earlier.

8
00:00:23,316 --> 00:00:26,357
But I was wondering if anyone here is a 2D animator.

9
00:00:27,513 --> 00:00:28,494
OK, awesome.

10
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:29,274
We have a couple.

11
00:00:29,874 --> 00:00:31,535
OK, that's good.

12
00:00:31,575 --> 00:00:33,136
We're going to cover a few things here today.

13
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:36,117
I want to go over a few basic animation principles, which

14
00:00:36,197 --> 00:00:37,738
might be old hat to some of you guys.

15
00:00:38,278 --> 00:00:39,659
But I want to go over specifically

16
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,439
how they relate to gameplay and how

17
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:43,000
to work within your game's restrictions

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,481
to get the best animation possible.

19
00:00:45,281 --> 00:00:47,542
Again, my experience has been in 2D so far,

20
00:00:47,602 --> 00:00:48,702
so that's what I'm going to cover.

21
00:00:49,103 --> 00:00:51,223
But hopefully, 3D animators can get something out of this

22
00:00:51,263 --> 00:00:51,564
as well.

23
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:55,545
Oh, and there was my overview.

24
00:00:57,787 --> 00:01:05,029
Okay, who am I? I started in the industry in 2009, so I'm still kind of a newcomer. I started

25
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:10,670
freelancing for WayForward, Ubisoft, and I actually didn't put Konami there, but I did that

26
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:16,971
as well. In 2010, I started working on a little indie project called Skullgirls, which was later

27
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:22,312
picked up by a developer and a publisher and became my full-time job as lead animator, and

28
00:01:22,392 --> 00:01:23,272
I've been doing that since.

29
00:01:27,062 --> 00:01:32,245
If you weren't aware, Skullgirls is a 2D fighting game for PSN,

30
00:01:32,346 --> 00:01:33,486
XBLA, and Steam.

31
00:01:33,786 --> 00:01:35,588
And I think the thing that makes it special

32
00:01:35,748 --> 00:01:37,609
is that it's entirely hand animated,

33
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:40,491
so every frame is drawn by a person.

34
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:44,753
Uh-oh, I lost my thing.

35
00:01:47,115 --> 00:01:49,856
OK, let's go over some animation principles.

36
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:52,709
Silhouette.

37
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,711
Silhouette is always important, but in games

38
00:01:55,731 --> 00:01:58,612
where characters need to move and read incredibly fast,

39
00:01:59,193 --> 00:02:01,354
silhouette is especially imperative.

40
00:02:01,934 --> 00:02:03,895
If you're punching, you need to see their fist.

41
00:02:04,295 --> 00:02:07,217
And if you're kicking, it needs, sorry, if you're blocking,

42
00:02:07,257 --> 00:02:08,918
it needs to read as a defensive stance.

43
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,900
Here are a few examples that I feel are just

44
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,140
examples of good silhouette.

45
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,422
I think that even though their motions aren't just

46
00:02:17,502 --> 00:02:20,743
normal punches or kicks, their attitude and their posing

47
00:02:20,944 --> 00:02:21,764
makes it very clear.

48
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:29,432
Anticipation. Anticipation is incredibly important.

49
00:02:29,813 --> 00:02:31,833
Without it, you don't even know an attack is coming.

50
00:02:32,314 --> 00:02:34,575
You don't even punch without winding up first.

51
00:02:35,235 --> 00:02:37,676
Anticipation is what's going to give your move contrast,

52
00:02:37,876 --> 00:02:39,397
help it read, and give it power.

53
00:02:40,097 --> 00:02:43,158
Even if it's short, I think having something to indicate winding up

54
00:02:43,238 --> 00:02:45,659
before throwing your punch is going to make it look better.

55
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:47,140
I have an example here.

56
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,464
This move is only six frames, it's a weak move in Skullgirls,

57
00:02:52,144 --> 00:02:55,147
and even though she's kind of a weird design, having

58
00:02:55,668 --> 00:02:59,251
one frame of her snake dragon guy Leviathan

59
00:03:00,072 --> 00:03:02,835
opening his mouth before smearing and snapping shut

60
00:03:03,315 --> 00:03:07,399
helps the move read better. And even though it is only one frame,

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,623
you don't really see it, I think, but you feel it, which is what counts.

62
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:17,450
And I do want to make a small note about anticipation.

63
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,632
Because we all work in games, well, most of us at least,

64
00:03:22,293 --> 00:03:23,694
I think we all know that there is

65
00:03:23,734 --> 00:03:26,075
a difference between animating your player character

66
00:03:26,155 --> 00:03:27,236
and your enemy character.

67
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:31,138
Your player has to respond to button presses by a player,

68
00:03:31,718 --> 00:03:33,419
so they have to be pretty instantaneous.

69
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:37,021
Whereas your enemies actually have to have a lot of wind up,

70
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:40,563
so your player has time to react by dodging or blocking

71
00:03:40,623 --> 00:03:41,444
or running away.

72
00:03:42,064 --> 00:03:44,306
So you find that you might actually not have time

73
00:03:44,346 --> 00:03:46,407
for a ton of anticipation in your player character's

74
00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:47,047
animations.

75
00:03:47,648 --> 00:03:49,549
And we'll go over how to tackle that in a second.

76
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,032
OK, so we can just jump right into animating.

77
00:03:56,505 --> 00:03:58,366
First thing is favoring your keys.

78
00:03:59,126 --> 00:04:03,187
I think everyone knows about ease in and ease out, and I've realized that for what I'm doing,

79
00:04:03,207 --> 00:04:08,328
where I only have so many frames to work with, I really need to focus on my keys to make

80
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,088
my poses read.

81
00:04:09,808 --> 00:04:14,369
I don't usually have as many frames as I'd like to get a super smooth motion, so I make

82
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:19,950
my in-betweens favor my keys as much as possible and build toward them to make everything read

83
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,490
and be clearer.

84
00:04:22,087 --> 00:04:26,148
I think you can see in this animation that it's basically only two poses.

85
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:29,050
There's no in between that's kind of just right in the middle.

86
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:34,012
But I think that because I favored my keys and focused on them, the overall motion reads

87
00:04:34,072 --> 00:04:35,353
as very clear and snappy.

88
00:04:39,103 --> 00:04:40,083
OK, follow through.

89
00:04:40,623 --> 00:04:42,664
So you're favoring your keys, and you

90
00:04:42,704 --> 00:04:44,925
find that your gaps are actually a little bit too big.

91
00:04:44,965 --> 00:04:46,026
The spacing is too big.

92
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,707
You can use follow through to fill in the gaps.

93
00:04:48,847 --> 00:04:51,888
That is stuff like hair, clothes, a big billowing cape.

94
00:04:52,508 --> 00:04:55,089
I think even if you have a character in one pose, just

95
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:58,251
a single frame, seeing where her hair and her clothes

96
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,812
are flowing from gives an indication of the motion

97
00:05:00,852 --> 00:05:01,372
she just made.

98
00:05:03,211 --> 00:05:06,714
This is also how you'd make a move without anticipation work.

99
00:05:07,194 --> 00:05:09,716
You could snap right into your active key post, that

100
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:12,218
is, that punching frame, and use follow-through

101
00:05:12,318 --> 00:05:13,399
as the missing information.

102
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:17,281
Use it as your missing link between your idle and your key.

103
00:05:17,802 --> 00:05:19,383
Go straight into your punch, and then

104
00:05:19,423 --> 00:05:21,004
have everything else catch up to it,

105
00:05:21,204 --> 00:05:22,185
and that will sell your motion.

106
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:27,156
This stuff might all seem basic because they're all animation principles,

107
00:05:27,557 --> 00:05:30,682
but I think knowing how to use them effectively in a game setting

108
00:05:31,143 --> 00:05:34,168
is what's going to help you cut down frames and make your animation more effective.

109
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:39,935
Okay, you need good smears.

110
00:05:40,515 --> 00:05:43,739
Smears will also help you fill in those gaps if you find that your spacing is large.

111
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,023
You should never underestimate how much a good smear will help sell your motion.

112
00:05:48,644 --> 00:05:53,909
This move featuring the Skullgirl's character Miss Fortune is basically entirely sold by its smear.

113
00:05:57,599 --> 00:05:59,261
Here are a few examples from some other games.

114
00:05:59,761 --> 00:06:01,643
I tried to pick ones that were all different styles,

115
00:06:01,764 --> 00:06:04,887
but obviously you can kind of just go nuts and do whatever.

116
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:08,991
In any case, even though they're only one frame,

117
00:06:09,091 --> 00:06:10,533
there's a lot of information here.

118
00:06:11,053 --> 00:06:13,296
You can tell the pose they're coming from.

119
00:06:14,277 --> 00:06:18,320
the motion they're currently making, obviously, and where they're going to end up.

120
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,123
So with one good smear, you're actually telling the player a lot of information.

121
00:06:23,143 --> 00:06:29,988
My thing just went weird. You're telling them a lot of information, and you can just convey a lot.

122
00:06:33,701 --> 00:06:34,683
Okay, overshoot.

123
00:06:35,264 --> 00:06:37,367
This is something I found that really helps

124
00:06:37,508 --> 00:06:39,431
amp up your animations, and I try to make sure

125
00:06:39,451 --> 00:06:41,354
to have it in anything that's an impact.

126
00:06:41,795 --> 00:06:43,338
So it doesn't quite work for smears,

127
00:06:43,518 --> 00:06:45,401
or sorry, for swings, but that's what we have

128
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:46,463
smears for anyways.

129
00:06:47,822 --> 00:06:51,924
I think it should be obvious that when you animate an attack, you don't want to ease into it.

130
00:06:52,384 --> 00:06:56,946
I found that having one frame, overshooting your final key, and then pulling back into it

131
00:06:57,307 --> 00:07:00,968
helps give it power and helps it read and just be snappy and strong.

132
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:06,571
It's also worth mentioning that, like what I've done here, you can combine your smear and your overshoot

133
00:07:07,351 --> 00:07:11,773
and also remember that to put it before your hit frame,

134
00:07:12,154 --> 00:07:14,575
because it's meant to give the impression of impact.

135
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,861
In this animation of Makoto from Street Fighter Third Strike,

136
00:07:22,221 --> 00:07:24,341
you can see that right before hitting her attack key,

137
00:07:24,441 --> 00:07:28,142
she reaches forward beyond it and then pulls back into it,

138
00:07:28,662 --> 00:07:30,543
and it helps it read as a stronger impact.

139
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,984
And I think also her sleeve catching up afterwards

140
00:07:34,044 --> 00:07:36,104
helps give it contrast, which helps it read better.

141
00:07:37,225 --> 00:07:40,105
These are all things that you don't necessarily see,

142
00:07:40,745 --> 00:07:44,466
but it helps the impact feel stronger and just feel

143
00:07:44,486 --> 00:07:44,947
a lot better.

144
00:07:48,653 --> 00:07:51,094
Okay, breaking the body, it's a little gruesome.

145
00:07:52,295 --> 00:07:55,496
This is something everyone should also remember, so let's go over it again.

146
00:07:55,516 --> 00:08:03,158
This is something you, sorry, when you're moving fast, you can just really go nuts on

147
00:08:03,198 --> 00:08:07,479
your in-betweens, and you can have some crazy drag that snaps into your key.

148
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:12,241
It's another thing, I'm going to go over this a lot, it's a thing that you don't see, but

149
00:08:12,281 --> 00:08:12,701
you feel.

150
00:08:16,795 --> 00:08:18,276
Here are a few examples from other games.

151
00:08:19,197 --> 00:08:21,758
You can see that all these poses aren't physically possible,

152
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:25,961
but having this kind of drag and weight is what's going to help your move look more powerful.

153
00:08:26,641 --> 00:08:30,604
Remember that you can lead a motion with a different body part than what your final key is.

154
00:08:31,024 --> 00:08:36,687
So say you're throwing a punch, you can throw their shoulder or just their entire body forward first

155
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:38,788
before coming around and then swinging their arm.

156
00:08:40,128 --> 00:08:43,190
I think, actually going back to this example with Valentine,

157
00:08:43,711 --> 00:08:45,992
she moves her entire body upwards,

158
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:49,094
striking this really weird pose that she's doing,

159
00:08:49,694 --> 00:08:53,617
before moving upwards and then snapping her arm,

160
00:08:53,817 --> 00:08:55,478
overshooting, and then pulling back into it.

161
00:08:56,198 --> 00:08:58,640
And I think even though that frame is really weird looking,

162
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,901
you don't see it in the final animation.

163
00:09:05,207 --> 00:09:07,989
And remember that we are all animating.

164
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,031
This is something I'm guilty of sometimes,

165
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:11,012
but you have to remember,

166
00:09:11,373 --> 00:09:13,535
you don't have to make every drawing look perfect

167
00:09:14,175 --> 00:09:15,897
as long as your motion is reading.

168
00:09:18,439 --> 00:09:20,421
Remember your foundations as an artist,

169
00:09:20,782 --> 00:09:22,723
but don't be afraid to break a few bones

170
00:09:22,904 --> 00:09:24,285
if it's gonna help your motion look better.

171
00:09:24,825 --> 00:09:26,407
Remember that you're creating movement,

172
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:27,908
not individual pieces of art.

173
00:09:32,107 --> 00:09:34,328
Okay, let's bring it back to games.

174
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:37,911
I think it'll help to go over a bit of how we made Skullgirls,

175
00:09:37,971 --> 00:09:41,033
because I think the key thing to making it work for us was in our process.

176
00:09:44,575 --> 00:09:49,119
So, here's a quick illustration of the different stages a character in Skullgirls will go through.

177
00:09:50,166 --> 00:10:00,429
After the brainstorm, we very quickly and roughly animate a move based on general frame counts of what like a weak, a medium, a hard, or hitstones, or specials, just all these things.

178
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:05,551
We will very quickly animate it, just knowing, based on that stuff.

179
00:10:06,371 --> 00:10:13,893
We then pass it to our designer, who implements it in the game as a rough, and makes it pretty much fully playable with hitboxes and all that.

180
00:10:14,854 --> 00:10:18,675
We then give it back to the animator with any notes or tweaks that we have to make.

181
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:23,756
And then we finish it up, pass it to our cleanup who adds the colors and the lines,

182
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,336
and then we implement it once again.

183
00:10:27,056 --> 00:10:33,157
Because... Sorry, it's fully animated, so... Sorry.

184
00:10:34,437 --> 00:10:37,818
It's fully animated and it's playable very early on.

185
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:41,999
So that means... I'm losing it, sorry.

186
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:44,099
I'm so nervous.

187
00:10:48,002 --> 00:10:50,263
It's playable when it's very rough.

188
00:10:50,863 --> 00:10:55,945
And so we can take the time to test it while it's super rough, while we can polish up the art.

189
00:10:59,206 --> 00:10:59,427
Okay.

190
00:11:00,303 --> 00:11:01,603
Remember what kind of game you're making.

191
00:11:02,424 --> 00:11:04,004
In Skullgirls, our rule of thumb,

192
00:11:04,185 --> 00:11:06,005
which we kind of always break,

193
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:09,387
but we have general frame counts of what a weak,

194
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:11,608
a medium, a hard move should be

195
00:11:11,768 --> 00:11:12,768
and how they generally work.

196
00:11:13,268 --> 00:11:15,429
So that means the artist can have fun with the visual

197
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:17,850
as long as it's clear and it adheres to gameplay.

198
00:11:18,631 --> 00:11:20,632
So our designer says, we need this.

199
00:11:21,272 --> 00:11:23,593
Our animator says, I'd like it to look like this.

200
00:11:24,073 --> 00:11:26,214
The designer says, it should work like this.

201
00:11:26,534 --> 00:11:27,775
And then the animator wakes the work.

202
00:11:30,749 --> 00:11:33,351
OK, this might be unique to Skullgirls

203
00:11:33,591 --> 00:11:35,713
because we do implement everything frame by frame,

204
00:11:36,213 --> 00:11:38,916
but we can take liberties with what's held for how long.

205
00:11:40,056 --> 00:11:42,699
A lot of the times, we found that holding frames at even

206
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:46,222
intervals, say the traditional equivalent of animating on twos,

207
00:11:47,143 --> 00:11:48,544
just leads us to wasting frames.

208
00:11:49,244 --> 00:11:52,988
So instead, you can focus on holding your keys

209
00:11:53,048 --> 00:11:55,009
and then building toward them, and then

210
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:57,491
your animation will look better without using more frames.

211
00:11:59,968 --> 00:12:01,789
So here I have an example from Skullgirls.

212
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,530
This is an example of an animation

213
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,631
we made look better just by fixing the timing.

214
00:12:07,332 --> 00:12:09,172
On the left is the older version,

215
00:12:09,753 --> 00:12:12,154
which we held everything at even intervals for.

216
00:12:12,794 --> 00:12:15,435
And for us, that was holding everything for three frames

217
00:12:15,695 --> 00:12:15,935
at 60 FPS.

218
00:12:17,967 --> 00:12:20,588
And then we just tweaked the timing.

219
00:12:21,228 --> 00:12:23,169
And we ended up holding the key poses longer

220
00:12:23,289 --> 00:12:24,370
and the smears shorter.

221
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:28,811
And hopefully you can see that just by adding a few holds

222
00:12:28,972 --> 00:12:30,472
makes the animation a lot snappier.

223
00:12:32,113 --> 00:12:36,075
It's subtle, but it's such a small difference

224
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:37,896
that it's really easy to make.

225
00:12:37,976 --> 00:12:39,376
And it does count in the end.

226
00:12:41,737 --> 00:12:42,838
Sorry, I'm a little sniffly.

227
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:47,342
I also want to mention something we call a hit stop.

228
00:12:47,782 --> 00:12:50,184
This is where you freeze the pose of the characters

229
00:12:50,364 --> 00:12:52,986
on an impact before playing the rest of the animation.

230
00:12:53,687 --> 00:12:56,269
This is more on the programmers than it is the animators,

231
00:12:56,429 --> 00:12:58,331
but I think this is also something worth mentioning.

232
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:01,874
It's just going to help your impacts feel a lot stronger.

233
00:13:01,894 --> 00:13:05,116
And we found that impacts actually

234
00:13:05,156 --> 00:13:07,458
tend to look a little watery or weak without it.

235
00:13:11,195 --> 00:13:14,715
Okay, this is short, but transitioning to and from the idle,

236
00:13:14,735 --> 00:13:20,376
I have found that you should actually have bigger spacing

237
00:13:20,396 --> 00:13:21,777
around your idle pose.

238
00:13:22,517 --> 00:13:24,877
When I started, I thought that just easing into it

239
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,758
was the way to go, and we found ourselves removing

240
00:13:27,798 --> 00:13:29,758
the frames I was drawing around the idle

241
00:13:30,438 --> 00:13:32,899
because it just slowed down the animation.

242
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:36,660
I was forgetting that the idle animation is a motion

243
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,620
and you don't want to ease into another motion.

244
00:13:41,261 --> 00:13:44,203
So the key to making it work was actually just having that larger spacing.

245
00:13:45,003 --> 00:13:48,385
And at least for fighting games, you don't want to go too nuts on the idle

246
00:13:48,485 --> 00:13:53,789
because it impacts the responsiveness of the rest of the game if you just have people returning to their idle forever.

247
00:13:57,871 --> 00:14:00,773
And remember that your gameplay is king.

248
00:14:01,648 --> 00:14:03,729
Remember that we are all making games,

249
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,051
and gameplay is the most important thing.

250
00:14:06,992 --> 00:14:08,753
Find ways to work with your designer.

251
00:14:09,233 --> 00:14:12,315
You may be able to animate the most beautiful jump

252
00:14:12,415 --> 00:14:15,357
with a ton of anticipation and this graceful landing,

253
00:14:15,777 --> 00:14:17,619
but it's not going to do your game any good

254
00:14:17,719 --> 00:14:19,140
if it doesn't work with the gameplay.

255
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:26,205
OK, so let's put it together.

256
00:14:27,275 --> 00:14:33,380
This applies mostly for attacks, which is most of what I've gone over anyways,

257
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,182
but I try to think of a move in four parts.

258
00:14:36,762 --> 00:14:41,446
The anticipation, the smear, the main attack key, and the return to idle.

259
00:14:43,461 --> 00:14:45,802
I think if you think of an attack in these parts,

260
00:14:45,962 --> 00:14:49,244
you can see how few frames it takes to get an action across.

261
00:14:50,064 --> 00:14:52,545
Having these parts means you can get it down

262
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,746
to as little as five to six frames, which is what

263
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:56,527
a weak move in Skullgirls is.

264
00:14:57,347 --> 00:14:59,048
The key thing is just to think about it like this,

265
00:14:59,128 --> 00:15:00,429
and you can actually do a lot with it.

266
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,731
OK, so here's everyone's favorite part.

267
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:07,832
This is where I screwed up.

268
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:14,467
I've been working on Skullgirls for four years now, which is kind of crazy, and I think it

269
00:15:14,507 --> 00:15:19,752
would be fair to say that had I the chance, I would go back and change a few things.

270
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:26,496
So the first thing I'm going to call fluid versus overanimated.

271
00:15:27,237 --> 00:15:29,859
When I started, I was just pouring frames

272
00:15:29,979 --> 00:15:30,840
into my animation.

273
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,743
And I didn't know how to effectively apply

274
00:15:34,863 --> 00:15:36,524
any of the principles I just talked about.

275
00:15:37,305 --> 00:15:39,967
I just wanted everything to look as smooth as possible.

276
00:15:40,448 --> 00:15:42,950
And I didn't realize how effective your animation could

277
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,871
be just by being smarter about it.

278
00:15:48,392 --> 00:15:54,354
So this is one of the moves that stands out to me as one of the most overanimated things I did.

279
00:15:54,794 --> 00:16:00,497
It was one of the first things I did and the funny thing about this one is that it became a standard.

280
00:16:01,057 --> 00:16:06,439
So now every character has this move where she gets hit, she falls to her knees, and then to

281
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,021
the ground. And so now every character has this move that's this overanimated.

282
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:19,728
I think everything, it's a little jittery, it lacks impact, it's just kind of weightless,

283
00:16:20,088 --> 00:16:23,850
and it's also 21 frames, which is actually a lot for us now.

284
00:16:24,931 --> 00:16:29,093
Again, we have moves that are as little as 6 that read as a full, complete motion, so

285
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,894
that this is 21 is kind of a lot.

286
00:16:35,807 --> 00:16:38,009
So this is the same move.

287
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:39,751
I just removed frames.

288
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,192
I didn't actually redraw any of it.

289
00:16:42,013 --> 00:16:44,555
And I removed six frames that I thought

290
00:16:44,595 --> 00:16:46,236
were kind of redundant, that didn't

291
00:16:46,557 --> 00:16:47,758
add to the overall motion.

292
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:49,859
And I think you can see that.

293
00:16:50,587 --> 00:16:56,331
it feels a lot snappier. It's definitely faster, so if we wanted to keep it to the same time in the game,

294
00:16:56,431 --> 00:17:01,275
I would have to redo more than this, but I think overall it just feels better, it's snappier,

295
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:06,459
and it's less frames without actually losing the overall impact of the animation.

296
00:17:11,313 --> 00:17:13,535
OK, so this is another early move.

297
00:17:13,955 --> 00:17:16,456
This is one of Sarabella's super moves, which

298
00:17:16,696 --> 00:17:18,637
are moves that we can take our time with,

299
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,379
but I still took too long.

300
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,741
I don't know why this is 45 frames.

301
00:17:25,801 --> 00:17:26,782
You can see it up there.

302
00:17:26,802 --> 00:17:28,462
It's a lot of frames for us.

303
00:17:29,223 --> 00:17:31,764
And I can actually share a couple technical details

304
00:17:31,824 --> 00:17:32,385
about this one.

305
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,633
This move, fully finished, is 11 megabytes.

306
00:17:37,274 --> 00:17:39,336
In comparison, an average super move,

307
00:17:39,396 --> 00:17:43,219
that is another one of this kind of move, is about four.

308
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:49,825
So this move is three times as large as a similar move

309
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,466
for no real reason.

310
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,171
Here it is again, same thing as before.

311
00:17:57,331 --> 00:17:58,372
I just took out frames.

312
00:17:59,385 --> 00:18:02,229
And I think this time it is a little bit choppier,

313
00:18:02,269 --> 00:18:03,750
so I would want to redo more than this.

314
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:06,013
But I got it down to 29 frames.

315
00:18:06,213 --> 00:18:08,256
I think the motion is clear and there's

316
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:09,598
no unnecessary dawdling.

317
00:18:10,198 --> 00:18:12,561
And I think if I took the time to actually redo it properly,

318
00:18:12,581 --> 00:18:13,963
I could get it down to even less.

319
00:18:18,775 --> 00:18:22,118
Okay, one more, just a really short one with our first character, Philia.

320
00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:26,943
This is her weak punch, and the original is seven frames, I have it on the left.

321
00:18:27,903 --> 00:18:32,487
And I just removed one frame before she punches, and I think you can see,

322
00:18:32,928 --> 00:18:36,351
just having that one frame taken out makes it a lot snappier.

323
00:18:36,371 --> 00:18:39,493
And one frame can just make a huge difference.

324
00:18:40,334 --> 00:18:43,897
And also a small dumb note about this one,

325
00:18:44,578 --> 00:18:47,600
we animated too much boob jiggle on the return

326
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,581
to idle for this one.

327
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:52,084
So our designer had to make her return to idle

328
00:18:52,504 --> 00:18:54,846
a separate state so you could interrupt it

329
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:56,087
to go to a different animation.

330
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,229
So we learned not to do that anymore.

331
00:19:02,092 --> 00:19:03,113
OK, let's wrap it up.

332
00:19:04,274 --> 00:19:06,276
Here are the main points I hope you can take away today.

333
00:19:07,673 --> 00:19:09,414
Hitting and holding your key poses

334
00:19:09,554 --> 00:19:11,736
is more important than super smooth in-betweens.

335
00:19:12,357 --> 00:19:14,939
Since we work in games, we want to make sure everything

336
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:16,260
is as clear as possible.

337
00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:19,503
Build toward your keys and use follow-through

338
00:19:19,543 --> 00:19:20,324
to fill in your gaps.

339
00:19:22,265 --> 00:19:25,488
The core parts of a move, the anticipation, the smear,

340
00:19:25,908 --> 00:19:27,610
the key, and the return to idle.

341
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,832
I think if you think of a move in these parts,

342
00:19:30,272 --> 00:19:33,094
you actually don't need a lot of frames to get a motion across.

343
00:19:35,537 --> 00:19:39,258
And third, animation can and should work with your game design.

344
00:19:39,598 --> 00:19:41,839
You should never feel restricted by your game design.

345
00:19:42,219 --> 00:19:43,420
You should talk with your designer.

346
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:48,162
What makes animation so fun and so great is how absolutely versatile it can be.

347
00:19:51,243 --> 00:19:53,864
And I want to share a few resources that have been invaluable to me.

348
00:19:55,444 --> 00:20:01,707
The first is Zvifus, which is a website that just indexes all the sprites from Street Fighter Third Strike.

349
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:05,819
And it's something I reference pretty much every day

350
00:20:05,879 --> 00:20:08,762
because I think that is one of the best animated games out there

351
00:20:09,402 --> 00:20:12,485
and just having the site that indexes it all is wonderful.

352
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:15,528
And the second is Fighters Generation,

353
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:19,812
which is just a general resource for fighting games,

354
00:20:19,972 --> 00:20:21,593
but what makes it best for animators

355
00:20:21,713 --> 00:20:24,015
is that it also just has a ton of sprites

356
00:20:24,596 --> 00:20:25,817
from all kinds of different games

357
00:20:25,937 --> 00:20:27,439
and it's also just a great reference.

358
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:30,481
And in general, study other games.

359
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:33,523
Just study what you like, find out why you like it,

360
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:34,444
and what makes it good.

361
00:20:34,904 --> 00:20:37,266
And if you can, go through them frame by frame,

362
00:20:37,406 --> 00:20:39,808
and really just get to know the stuff

363
00:20:39,908 --> 00:20:41,209
that you find most appealing.

364
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,391
Okay, that wraps it up.

365
00:20:44,851 --> 00:20:46,072
Thank you all so much for coming.

366
00:20:46,553 --> 00:20:47,873
I guess we're all gonna get lunch now.

367
00:20:48,054 --> 00:20:49,014
Sorry, I was nervous.

368
00:20:51,996 --> 00:20:54,498
And enjoy the rest of the bootcamp.
