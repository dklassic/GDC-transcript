1
00:00:05,857 --> 00:00:07,617
My name's Jeremy Griffith.

2
00:00:07,617 --> 00:00:12,418
I've been a VFX artist in games for roughly 10 years.

3
00:00:12,418 --> 00:00:16,679
I have a background in AAA shooters like Bioshock Infinite

4
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:19,839
and Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 3.

5
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:22,440
In addition, I've worked on a lot of smaller games

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,041
in a contract capacity and released a few of my own games

7
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,681
that I solo developed like Flippy Cups.

8
00:00:27,681 --> 00:00:29,581
And now I'm a senior VFX artist at Riot.

9
00:00:36,201 --> 00:00:39,623
So what this talk is about is trying to drill in

10
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:43,564
to one of the central tensions that we face

11
00:00:43,564 --> 00:00:46,226
in VFX animation, and that's related to

12
00:00:46,226 --> 00:00:49,187
what our target actually is.

13
00:00:49,187 --> 00:00:50,888
Are we going for realism?

14
00:00:50,888 --> 00:00:54,990
Are we trying to perfectly capture the surface properties

15
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,950
of all the natural phenomenon like water?

16
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:04,814
Or is our real target more of a more vague believability?

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,164
I see this debate as mapping cleanly onto

18
00:01:09,164 --> 00:01:14,771
is our target detail or is it actually underlying energy?

19
00:01:14,771 --> 00:01:18,335
This is something that we face all the time

20
00:01:18,335 --> 00:01:23,903
in specifically game VFX because we take things like this,

21
00:01:25,355 --> 00:01:34,178
puff of smoke or cloud, every point of detail in this image is implying a vector, a directional

22
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:37,859
vector of how energy is moving.

23
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:43,221
And then we do this, and we completely violate those energies.

24
00:01:43,221 --> 00:01:47,603
And our work tends to fall flat, at least in my opinion.

25
00:01:47,603 --> 00:01:53,245
So this talk is going to go into how I like to make fire from leaves.

26
00:01:54,883 --> 00:01:58,546
But before we do that, I want to talk about why

27
00:01:58,546 --> 00:02:04,072
I would choose to do that in the first place and why it works.

28
00:02:04,072 --> 00:02:09,097
And I see why it works as being directly related to ideas

29
00:02:09,097 --> 00:02:10,178
from philosophical Taoism.

30
00:02:10,178 --> 00:02:15,423
Taoism is a complex, developed philosophy

31
00:02:15,423 --> 00:02:17,565
that originated in the Warring States period

32
00:02:17,565 --> 00:02:18,606
in classical China.

33
00:02:21,228 --> 00:02:28,072
And kind of the foundational idea of Taoism is that there are deep running relationships

34
00:02:28,072 --> 00:02:30,193
between very different things in the world.

35
00:02:30,193 --> 00:02:36,676
There is in fact this organizing principle or process that we are all a part of, that

36
00:02:36,676 --> 00:02:38,277
we all emerge from, called the Tao.

37
00:02:38,277 --> 00:02:39,378
So what this talk is going to attempt to do...

38
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:50,657
is trace the relationship between these ideas from Taoism

39
00:02:50,657 --> 00:02:53,200
and world art history,

40
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,843
and how I am going to argue that it can be applied

41
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,665
to VFX animation and help us with our work.

42
00:02:59,665 --> 00:03:02,528
So the way this talk is organized,

43
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:06,111
we've already done the problem statement.

44
00:03:06,111 --> 00:03:09,414
We're gonna trace this problem

45
00:03:09,414 --> 00:03:11,916
through some examples in art history.

46
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,778
We're going to consider a mindset.

47
00:03:14,206 --> 00:03:16,586
that would privilege energy over detail

48
00:03:16,586 --> 00:03:20,087
to the expense of detail, trace that mindset

49
00:03:20,087 --> 00:03:23,228
to Taoism specifically, and put this mindset

50
00:03:23,228 --> 00:03:25,368
to work in VFX shaders.

51
00:03:25,368 --> 00:03:31,390
So I have kind of a weird mixed background.

52
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:37,191
I have an academic background in comparative philosophy

53
00:03:37,191 --> 00:03:41,752
at a graduate level with a special focus on China.

54
00:03:43,783 --> 00:03:48,866
and with an even more detailed focus in Taoism in particular.

55
00:03:48,866 --> 00:03:51,208
However, I do not speak Mandarin.

56
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,229
My pronunciation is awful.

57
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:57,271
To any native or learned speakers in the room, I'm sorry.

58
00:03:57,271 --> 00:04:02,634
So this tension between detail and energy

59
00:04:02,634 --> 00:04:05,375
can be observed even in still art.

60
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:09,237
As an example of detail without energy,

61
00:04:09,237 --> 00:04:12,639
observe this beautiful painting, Watson and the Shark

62
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,540
by John Copley.

63
00:04:15,293 --> 00:04:17,434
This is a gorgeous painting.

64
00:04:17,434 --> 00:04:18,694
I've always liked this painting.

65
00:04:18,694 --> 00:04:20,974
The composition is incredible.

66
00:04:20,974 --> 00:04:25,435
The atmosphere, the drama, the figures,

67
00:04:25,435 --> 00:04:29,456
but the water I have some problems with as a VFX artist.

68
00:04:29,456 --> 00:04:33,637
It's incredibly detailed.

69
00:04:33,637 --> 00:04:37,817
It's richly treated, but it kind of looks like gelatin.

70
00:04:37,817 --> 00:04:39,958
It's like a Jell-O mold,

71
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,098
and the boy and the shark are like fruit in the Jell-O.

72
00:04:44,116 --> 00:04:46,558
the water isn't really interacting with them,

73
00:04:46,558 --> 00:04:52,283
and the water itself, I have a hard time seeing

74
00:04:52,283 --> 00:04:54,965
an internal logic of energy at work.

75
00:04:54,965 --> 00:05:00,870
So, on the opposite side of the spectrum,

76
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,531
we have energy without detail.

77
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:05,313
And I'm bad at PowerPoint.

78
00:05:05,313 --> 00:05:06,454
Yay, all right.

79
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:15,911
So as an example of energy without detail,

80
00:05:15,911 --> 00:05:20,173
this is 1,000 miles along the River Yangtze.

81
00:05:20,173 --> 00:05:25,615
The author is unknown, but it's dated to the Ming Dynasty.

82
00:05:25,615 --> 00:05:31,278
And the approach here is radically different

83
00:05:31,278 --> 00:05:32,479
than the John Copley painting.

84
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,620
There's no surface detail whatsoever to this water.

85
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,181
It's all energy.

86
00:05:39,202 --> 00:05:42,203
The only things telling you that this is water

87
00:05:42,203 --> 00:05:46,765
are the way that the water is interacting with other things,

88
00:05:46,765 --> 00:05:49,686
its own internal logic of how it flows,

89
00:05:49,686 --> 00:05:51,386
the fact that there are eddies forming

90
00:05:51,386 --> 00:05:53,427
in these little pockets the way you would expect

91
00:05:53,427 --> 00:05:54,988
water to form eddies.

92
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:58,549
The artist here has eschewed all detail in favor of energy.

93
00:05:58,549 --> 00:06:00,349
And I find that very, very compelling.

94
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:11,604
I'll just leave it.

95
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:19,971
All right, we're back.

96
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:26,257
So to do a deep dive on this particular approach

97
00:06:26,257 --> 00:06:30,100
to depicting water, we could look at Ma Yuan's Water Album,

98
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,782
or variably, a study on the properties of water

99
00:06:32,782 --> 00:06:33,783
from the Song Dynasty.

100
00:06:34,792 --> 00:06:38,155
And you see a very similar logic to the approach here.

101
00:06:38,155 --> 00:06:40,978
There is little to no surface detail.

102
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:45,302
It's every stroke on the page is rather focused

103
00:06:45,302 --> 00:06:50,407
on capturing a deep sense of the logic

104
00:06:50,407 --> 00:06:55,572
of how this stuff moves and the shapes that it creates

105
00:06:55,572 --> 00:06:59,335
when it becomes turbulent and contrasting those shapes

106
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,116
when it is laminar.

107
00:07:02,098 --> 00:07:05,840
So, okay, why do I find these depictions so successful,

108
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,321
despite their simplicity?

109
00:07:07,321 --> 00:07:10,482
They don't have the beautiful surface detail

110
00:07:10,482 --> 00:07:12,563
in this Copley.

111
00:07:12,563 --> 00:07:15,925
They don't have the amazing sense of dimensionality

112
00:07:15,925 --> 00:07:18,826
and drama and lighting in this Turner.

113
00:07:18,826 --> 00:07:23,928
And they certainly don't have this incredible sense

114
00:07:23,928 --> 00:07:27,090
of surface reflectivity from this Anders Zorn.

115
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,530
This is a watercolor, by the way.

116
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:33,142
It's one of my favorite pictures of water in the world.

117
00:07:33,142 --> 00:07:38,947
Now this speaks to me specifically as a VFX artist.

118
00:07:38,947 --> 00:07:44,872
So, what I'd like to argue is that these artists

119
00:07:44,872 --> 00:07:50,797
were essentially drawing with energy in mind

120
00:07:50,797 --> 00:07:52,539
at the forefront.

121
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:53,119
They had

122
00:07:54,086 --> 00:07:57,310
learned at a deep level how water works by observing it,

123
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,353
and then were recreating that on the fly with their brush.

124
00:08:00,353 --> 00:08:06,801
So, as we've seen, this tension between surface detail

125
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:10,265
and underlying energy can be found even in still images,

126
00:08:10,265 --> 00:08:14,409
but motion makes this infinitely worse of a problem.

127
00:08:16,407 --> 00:08:19,788
In fact, erroneous detail or superfluous detail

128
00:08:19,788 --> 00:08:23,489
is far, far worse for us than a lack of detail.

129
00:08:23,489 --> 00:08:27,050
For myself in my own work, criticizing my own work

130
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,931
and the work of others, I call this wrong shapes.

131
00:08:30,931 --> 00:08:32,972
Going back to our smoke puff example,

132
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:35,733
as we were talking about, every point on this cloud,

133
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:38,854
this richly detailed cloud,

134
00:08:38,854 --> 00:08:40,775
is implying its own vector of motion,

135
00:08:40,775 --> 00:08:43,636
its own vector of energy, and when we do this,

136
00:08:43,636 --> 00:08:45,776
we completely violate that sense of energy.

137
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:46,156
This is.

138
00:08:47,223 --> 00:08:52,148
fundamentally wrong and we, to each other,

139
00:08:52,148 --> 00:08:54,571
we ask this question all the time,

140
00:08:54,571 --> 00:08:55,352
like does it feel right?

141
00:08:55,352 --> 00:08:56,753
Yeah, that doesn't feel right.

142
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:59,356
And what we're really doing is asking ourselves,

143
00:08:59,356 --> 00:09:00,818
like is the energy right here

144
00:09:00,818 --> 00:09:07,145
or are we fundamentally violating a deep logic by doing that?

145
00:09:10,214 --> 00:09:19,084
So we're left with a question, okay, what led the Chinese ink wash masters down this route of privileging energy over detail in their work?

146
00:09:19,084 --> 00:09:23,729
And I would argue that, bringing it back to Taoism, that it was Taoism.

147
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,992
So Taoism.

148
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:29,909
as a philosophy, this is going to be a caricature of Taoism.

149
00:09:29,909 --> 00:09:34,672
I don't have time here to go into a rigorous laying out

150
00:09:34,672 --> 00:09:36,574
of everything about Taoism.

151
00:09:36,574 --> 00:09:39,556
But if you want to invite me to do a talk on that sometime,

152
00:09:39,556 --> 00:09:41,497
I'd be happy to do it.

153
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:48,502
Taoism looks to nature, but not just nature, the natural,

154
00:09:48,502 --> 00:09:50,903
the spontaneous, the unspoiled.

155
00:09:50,903 --> 00:09:52,985
It's kind of Rousseauian in that sense.

156
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:58,620
And there's this term, zuran, which means the self-so.

157
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:06,783
To act with zuran means that you are so unencumbered by falseness

158
00:10:06,783 --> 00:10:12,024
that you just overflow with genuine action.

159
00:10:12,024 --> 00:10:15,826
Your spirit bubbles forth directly into action.

160
00:10:18,662 --> 00:10:24,707
So that foundational concept, as we were looking at a little bit in the beginning of Taoism, is the Tao.

161
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:31,893
And this could be thought of as the way of all things as they hang together, the process, the generating function.

162
00:10:31,893 --> 00:10:39,299
But there's also a natural individual way of each thing, individually,

163
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:43,823
its own path to establishing that spirit of zirdan.

164
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:49,070
And because we are all grounded in this process,

165
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:52,051
there is a radical sense of interconnectedness

166
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,391
taken as a foundational assumption in Taoism.

167
00:10:54,391 --> 00:10:58,492
This is referred to in the texts as boundlessness,

168
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:01,293
no boundaries between things,

169
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:05,314
or my favorite, intoxicating bottomlessness,

170
00:11:05,314 --> 00:11:06,054
essentially that

171
00:11:07,073 --> 00:11:12,296
every object in the universe opens itself up to every other object in the universe,

172
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:18,519
and there is a radical sense in which I'm looking at the entire universe when I'm looking at this

173
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:28,865
box of water. So from Dao De Jing, chapter 62, way making or Dao is the flowing together of all

174
00:11:28,865 --> 00:11:32,387
things. There is truly in the world a deep

175
00:11:32,824 --> 00:11:36,366
running sense of connection between very disparate things.

176
00:11:36,366 --> 00:11:40,748
I actually think this is a more true way

177
00:11:40,748 --> 00:11:44,829
to think about the world than to assume radical separateness

178
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:45,370
between things.

179
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:49,211
So from this assumption of interconnectedness,

180
00:11:49,211 --> 00:11:53,053
Taoism develops a morality of non-interventionism.

181
00:11:53,053 --> 00:11:57,855
It's encapsulated beautifully in this phrase,

182
00:11:57,855 --> 00:12:02,437
which means acting without acting or non-coercive action.

183
00:12:03,247 --> 00:12:07,088
It is essentially acting with the grain of the Tao,

184
00:12:07,088 --> 00:12:10,450
along the grain of the Tao, not forcing things,

185
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:15,332
not getting in the ways of other things.

186
00:12:15,332 --> 00:12:18,814
This is put beautifully in Tao Te Ching chapter 64.

187
00:12:18,814 --> 00:12:22,195
Those who would do things ruin them.

188
00:12:22,195 --> 00:12:25,637
Those who would control things lose them.

189
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:30,107
Hence, because the sages do things non-coercively with wu-wei,

190
00:12:30,107 --> 00:12:32,128
they do not ruin them.

191
00:12:32,128 --> 00:12:35,490
And because they do not try to control things, they do not lose them.

192
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:43,855
So, taking a richly detailed puff of smoke and then rotating it to the right

193
00:12:43,855 --> 00:12:44,596
is not acting with wu-wei.

194
00:12:44,596 --> 00:12:49,939
And in the sense, wu-wei is both moral and practical.

195
00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:51,020
It is both what you should do.

196
00:12:52,035 --> 00:12:54,316
because you don't want to harm other things,

197
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:57,916
you don't want to coerce other beings,

198
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,877
but it's also what you should do

199
00:12:59,877 --> 00:13:00,717
if you want to be successful.

200
00:13:00,717 --> 00:13:06,338
There's a sense in which acting with wu wei

201
00:13:06,338 --> 00:13:09,138
relies on being able to see these deep relationships

202
00:13:09,138 --> 00:13:11,819
between things, between beings in the world

203
00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:13,939
and act in accordance with those relationships,

204
00:13:13,939 --> 00:13:16,400
to not do violence to them.

205
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,280
And this is illustrated beautifully in the Zhuangzi,

206
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,440
my favorite book in the world.

207
00:13:21,229 --> 00:13:25,670
in this parable of cook ding or butcher ding.

208
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,991
So how this story goes is,

209
00:13:27,991 --> 00:13:33,812
the ruler of some province is having a cow butchered for him

210
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:36,612
and he is amazed at the skill,

211
00:13:36,612 --> 00:13:38,293
the virtuosity of this butcher.

212
00:13:38,293 --> 00:13:40,393
The butcher's knife just goes clean through

213
00:13:40,393 --> 00:13:41,574
as if through nothing.

214
00:13:41,574 --> 00:13:44,014
And the cow is fully butchered within a matter of minutes.

215
00:13:44,014 --> 00:13:48,495
And the ruler says, how did you come across this skill?

216
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,595
How did you come by this?

217
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:54,697
And the butcher says, it's not skill, it's Tao.

218
00:13:54,697 --> 00:13:57,437
When I first started butchering cows,

219
00:13:57,437 --> 00:14:00,918
all I saw was the cow from the outside.

220
00:14:00,918 --> 00:14:03,159
I saw its surface.

221
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:05,559
But as I butchered more and more cows,

222
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:10,520
I stopped looking with my visual eyes

223
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,301
and began to see the deep structure of the cow

224
00:14:13,301 --> 00:14:16,441
and how it relates to the universe with my mind's eye.

225
00:14:16,441 --> 00:14:19,602
And so he just follows the Tao through the cow.

226
00:14:21,163 --> 00:14:28,267
And this is from a famous illustrated book of the Zhuangzi,

227
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,128
which I highly recommend.

228
00:14:29,128 --> 00:14:33,071
It's very popular in both Taiwan and China.

229
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:35,412
It's highly, highly recommended.

230
00:14:35,412 --> 00:14:40,255
So the butcher has learned to see

231
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:42,817
the deep relationships between things.

232
00:14:42,817 --> 00:14:45,238
He has internalized the Tao in a way

233
00:14:45,238 --> 00:14:46,960
that helps him do his work.

234
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,881
In this case, it's the Tao of Cao,

235
00:14:48,881 --> 00:14:50,802
but we can extrapolate this to other things.

236
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:53,806
We can extrapolate this to aesthetics.

237
00:14:53,806 --> 00:14:59,870
So if you want to be a Taoist artist, what you would do

238
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,351
is internalize the way of your subject,

239
00:15:02,351 --> 00:15:06,073
such that you can capture it with wu-wei,

240
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:07,934
without doing violence to what it is trying

241
00:15:07,934 --> 00:15:09,515
to do naturally on its own.

242
00:15:09,515 --> 00:15:12,797
This is put beautifully in this book,

243
00:15:12,797 --> 00:15:16,379
The Great Image Has No Form, by Francois Jullien,

244
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:20,261
as being used by the universe to depict itself.

245
00:15:21,072 --> 00:15:25,293
rather than trying to represent the universe from without.

246
00:15:25,293 --> 00:15:29,914
And he didn't just make this up as some French guy.

247
00:15:29,914 --> 00:15:33,875
He drew this encapsulation of a set of ideas

248
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:37,515
from the writers themselves, or the artists themselves,

249
00:15:37,515 --> 00:15:42,356
from their writings, such as Guo Xi.

250
00:15:42,356 --> 00:15:47,597
So to put a pin on it, if you create art with wu wei,

251
00:15:49,307 --> 00:15:52,189
letting a subject ring true with its own ziran,

252
00:15:52,189 --> 00:15:55,411
then the Tao itself can shine through.

253
00:15:55,411 --> 00:15:58,092
In essence, you're not getting in the way of your subject,

254
00:15:58,092 --> 00:16:01,554
like with erroneous detail or superfluous detail.

255
00:16:01,554 --> 00:16:06,997
And the artists that created these depictions of water

256
00:16:06,997 --> 00:16:08,598
that we're considering in this talk

257
00:16:08,598 --> 00:16:11,459
absolutely had these ideas in mind.

258
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:14,921
To drive home how ubiquitous these concepts

259
00:16:14,921 --> 00:16:17,662
like Tao, wuwei, and ziran were in the culture,

260
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:22,162
consider an amazing phenomenon, scholar's rocks.

261
00:16:22,162 --> 00:16:29,027
So scholar's rocks are rocks that are thought to

262
00:16:29,027 --> 00:16:31,149
portray the Tao, in a sense.

263
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:32,790
They're like a shadow of the Tao.

264
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:36,373
They are records of energies as they trace the course.

265
00:16:36,373 --> 00:16:39,556
And that you can find them on desks, in gardens.

266
00:16:39,556 --> 00:16:42,138
There's even this painting called

267
00:16:42,138 --> 00:16:44,580
Mifu Bowing to a Rock by Guo Shu.

268
00:16:45,822 --> 00:16:53,325
which shows how deeply ingrained this idea of venerating the Tao as you find it in the world to be.

269
00:16:53,325 --> 00:17:00,769
Okay, so what the hell does this have to do with VFX animation?

270
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:03,830
So, just like a scholar's rock,

271
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:09,293
every static structure in the world is actually a record of energy flow.

272
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:20,013
leaves are a record of the energy as it flew or flowed through the growing leaf.

273
00:17:20,013 --> 00:17:28,177
Just like a scholar's rock, a leaf is a record of energies flowing through the Tao. So

274
00:17:28,177 --> 00:17:36,922
how do we make use of this? I personally see a deep connection between

275
00:17:38,003 --> 00:17:41,366
the shapes in leaves and the shapes in fire.

276
00:17:41,366 --> 00:17:46,390
So stepping through this quickly,

277
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:52,415
removing some of the detail of a leaf

278
00:17:52,415 --> 00:17:55,878
gets us access to kind of a more general truth

279
00:17:55,878 --> 00:17:57,379
about how they grow.

280
00:17:57,379 --> 00:18:00,181
It is essentially unlocking energies

281
00:18:00,181 --> 00:18:04,144
hidden behind the specific details.

282
00:18:04,144 --> 00:18:07,087
And then we can build that detail back up.

283
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:12,312
with motion and with logics, internal logics.

284
00:18:12,312 --> 00:18:15,293
This is an offset internal logic of leaf.

285
00:18:15,293 --> 00:18:20,175
And then we can overlay an internal logic of fire,

286
00:18:20,175 --> 00:18:24,677
which is really just a gradient of heat and fuel.

287
00:18:24,677 --> 00:18:28,058
And then clamp it, bring some interior detail back

288
00:18:28,058 --> 00:18:29,579
with multiply and apply color.

289
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:30,239
And that's how I make fire from leaves.

290
00:18:36,847 --> 00:18:39,208
This works because I truly believe

291
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,449
there is a deep relationship between

292
00:18:41,449 --> 00:18:44,591
the forms in leaves and the forms in fire.

293
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:49,114
And because static structures are records of energy flow,

294
00:18:49,114 --> 00:18:50,475
we can gain access to those,

295
00:18:50,475 --> 00:18:52,636
but we have to remove some of the detail

296
00:18:52,636 --> 00:18:56,558
that would otherwise be erroneous and superfluous

297
00:18:56,558 --> 00:18:58,720
in what we're trying to create, in this case fire.

298
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:58,800
So.

299
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:10,864
A usefulness of this approach is getting intraparticle motion,

300
00:19:10,864 --> 00:19:14,328
which is a type of detail that works much better in motion

301
00:19:14,328 --> 00:19:17,772
than taking static detail, like in that cloud,

302
00:19:17,772 --> 00:19:20,856
and moving it around like this.

303
00:19:20,856 --> 00:19:23,960
However, we also can't do that with this.

304
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,683
That's probably even worse.

305
00:19:28,075 --> 00:19:32,117
So, working in this way kind of pushes you

306
00:19:32,117 --> 00:19:34,878
into a different workflow.

307
00:19:34,878 --> 00:19:37,539
It's less about sprites, rotating sprites around,

308
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:42,021
and more about meshes as paths for the energy to move.

309
00:19:42,021 --> 00:19:46,743
And the benefit of this is it's extremely flexible.

310
00:19:46,743 --> 00:19:50,285
If you've taken the time to build up.

311
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:56,876
energy that's truthful to the subject, then you can give it all sorts of paths to follow

312
00:19:56,876 --> 00:19:59,277
and it will feel right.

313
00:19:59,277 --> 00:20:00,558
You can also change the scale.

314
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:02,880
You might have to adjust, but it kind of just works.

315
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:13,148
So the general technique is getting at the more general relationships between things

316
00:20:13,148 --> 00:20:18,733
by removing detail and then building that detail back up, unlocking the energy.

317
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:22,246
kind of locked in these static structures in the world,

318
00:20:22,246 --> 00:20:26,571
and then letting it roam on the paths that we can make for it.

319
00:20:26,571 --> 00:20:29,073
And this doesn't just work by accident.

320
00:20:29,073 --> 00:20:31,215
There really are deep relationships

321
00:20:31,215 --> 00:20:35,199
between things in the world, like giraffe skin,

322
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:37,862
the caustic patterns on the bottom of a pool,

323
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:38,883
and cracked earth.

324
00:20:38,883 --> 00:20:41,265
Other people have noticed this.

325
00:20:41,265 --> 00:20:44,668
I highly recommend the work of Philip Ball on this subject.

326
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,353
And we actually already do this all the time

327
00:20:49,353 --> 00:20:50,714
with noise textures.

328
00:20:50,714 --> 00:20:54,998
Noise textures are a general statement

329
00:20:54,998 --> 00:20:56,659
about how things in the world work.

330
00:20:56,659 --> 00:20:58,520
And they don't work by accident.

331
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,462
They're actually related in deep ways

332
00:21:00,462 --> 00:21:01,963
to how the universe is actually structured.

333
00:21:01,963 --> 00:21:05,625
Voronoi, for example, can be thought of

334
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:08,388
as this general case that shows up

335
00:21:08,388 --> 00:21:12,310
in many different objects as a sort of tension

336
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,672
that gives rise to boundaries or boundedness.

337
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:19,379
and you can see Voronoi at work in these three things

338
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:21,960
that we've been considering.

339
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,721
Ryan Brucks has worked with this.

340
00:21:24,721 --> 00:21:26,301
I highly recommend his blog post,

341
00:21:26,301 --> 00:21:29,242
Getting the Most Out of Noise in UE4,

342
00:21:29,242 --> 00:21:31,922
where he takes Voronoi and he builds it up

343
00:21:31,922 --> 00:21:36,783
into cracked earth and caustic patterns and even marble.

344
00:21:36,783 --> 00:21:42,125
But personally, I like to use Voronoi for water,

345
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,225
in particular, turbulence.

346
00:21:44,225 --> 00:21:44,325
So.

347
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,281
building up here, throw down a cylinder,

348
00:21:50,281 --> 00:21:52,941
add in some normals and mask it away,

349
00:21:52,941 --> 00:21:54,502
add in some world position offset

350
00:21:54,502 --> 00:21:58,183
and some quick stylized color, and you end up here.

351
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:07,625
So, I believe there is a fundamental affinity

352
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:14,067
between the shapes that Ma Yuan was trying to capture here

353
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:15,707
and the essence of Voronoi noise.

354
00:22:17,277 --> 00:22:20,599
And hopefully you can trace a direct lineage

355
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:23,420
from Ma Yuan to this water shader.

356
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:28,782
So a takeaway here is that focusing on energy

357
00:22:28,782 --> 00:22:32,344
more than detail and then using those energies

358
00:22:32,344 --> 00:22:35,005
to build up detail that's more appropriate

359
00:22:35,005 --> 00:22:39,347
actually empowers us to work in a wider range

360
00:22:39,347 --> 00:22:41,668
of art directions with more consistent results.

361
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,262
And actually, it would have been possible to build

362
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:45,924
either the fire or the water shader

363
00:22:45,924 --> 00:22:48,866
with like a slider from realistic to stylized.

364
00:22:48,866 --> 00:22:51,768
Would have been cool, I didn't do it.

365
00:22:51,768 --> 00:22:54,630
Ran out of time.

366
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:58,413
So, in contrast, relying on surface detail

367
00:22:58,413 --> 00:23:02,335
like reflectivity and transparency is far less flexible.

368
00:23:02,335 --> 00:23:05,758
And had I chosen to rely on those things

369
00:23:05,758 --> 00:23:07,379
to make that water look like water,

370
00:23:07,379 --> 00:23:10,521
I suspect that the underlying energy of the water

371
00:23:10,521 --> 00:23:11,582
would have been inferior.

372
00:23:13,006 --> 00:23:17,268
And again, this works because there really are

373
00:23:17,268 --> 00:23:19,610
deep connections between disparate things in the world.

374
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:25,393
Because static structures are records of energy flow.

375
00:23:25,393 --> 00:23:29,235
Everything comes back to energy flow eventually.

376
00:23:29,235 --> 00:23:34,058
Okay, so if we are thinking about Taoist aesthetics

377
00:23:34,058 --> 00:23:37,500
as essentially internalizing the Tao,

378
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,102
okay, how do I do that?

379
00:23:40,102 --> 00:23:40,682
For myself?

380
00:23:41,652 --> 00:23:46,434
uh, my path has been getting just really interested in these patterns. Um, for

381
00:23:46,434 --> 00:23:52,776
example, patterns that emerge from Wolfram cellular automata. A cellular

382
00:23:52,776 --> 00:23:59,199
automata is basically a grid of, um, like on off switches that have rules for

383
00:23:59,199 --> 00:24:03,820
just like their neighbors and what they're going to do. And on on rule four

384
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,802
you can see that, uh, you know, it's basically

385
00:24:07,562 --> 00:24:13,666
nothingness and then full randomness is just noise, but with a grid of automata and a simple

386
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:19,270
rule, actually really interesting, deeply rich forms can emerge, like rule 60.

387
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:25,334
And these forms happen to pop up, actually, all over the place.

388
00:24:25,334 --> 00:24:28,216
A shell is essentially a one-dimensional cellular automata.

389
00:24:32,007 --> 00:24:37,009
And I've also been interested in mathematical objects

390
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:37,949
like the Sierpinski triangle,

391
00:24:37,949 --> 00:24:39,830
which is more or less a fractal.

392
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:44,831
It operates on this simple rule,

393
00:24:44,831 --> 00:24:47,892
and it turns out that even a Sierpinski triangle

394
00:24:47,892 --> 00:24:48,592
shows up on shells.

395
00:24:48,592 --> 00:24:51,633
And this is actually mine.

396
00:24:53,793 --> 00:24:56,414
I have a collection of these cellular automata shells.

397
00:24:56,414 --> 00:25:01,297
This was from my desk a couple days ago.

398
00:25:01,297 --> 00:25:02,457
These are my scholar's rocks.

399
00:25:02,457 --> 00:25:06,840
But I think the better strategy to internalize the Tao is to just go out into the world,

400
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,042
to train yourself to see the connections between things.

401
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:17,025
And a great way to do that is by taking your own reference.

402
00:25:17,025 --> 00:25:23,248
This is Voronoi noise that I found in the wild, very studiously, on a beer glass.

403
00:25:26,061 --> 00:25:29,843
And I hope you can see the fundamental similarity

404
00:25:29,843 --> 00:25:31,564
between these forms in this beer foam

405
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:36,566
and these beautifully depicted forms from Ma Yuan.

406
00:25:36,566 --> 00:25:38,227
So the takeaways I hope that I've left you with

407
00:25:38,227 --> 00:25:43,630
is that as effects artists,

408
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:47,712
if you have to choose between energy and detail,

409
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:51,033
the choice for me is clear every time, choose energy.

410
00:25:51,623 --> 00:25:57,966
It'll be far easier to add detail to something with good energy than try to add energy to something with too much detail.

411
00:25:57,966 --> 00:26:03,028
Also that there really are deep connections between disparate things in the world,

412
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:08,170
like there are ideas from Taoism that are fundamentally true.

413
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:13,593
And that we can make use of those general relationships between things

414
00:26:13,593 --> 00:26:19,755
to build up a sort of detail that works much better in motion than static detail.

415
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:24,663
So to leave you with one last idea from Taoism,

416
00:26:24,663 --> 00:26:27,844
there is this concept of xiao yao you,

417
00:26:27,844 --> 00:26:30,184
which means free and easy wandering.

418
00:26:30,184 --> 00:26:34,585
And it is essentially to

419
00:26:34,585 --> 00:26:38,346
willingly shed some of the responsibilities from society,

420
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:40,106
some of the expectations,

421
00:26:40,106 --> 00:26:42,307
and wander easily through the world,

422
00:26:42,307 --> 00:26:44,207
through nature in particular.

423
00:26:44,207 --> 00:26:47,568
So if you are finding yourself soon

424
00:26:47,568 --> 00:26:48,608
struggling on a problem,

425
00:26:49,704 --> 00:26:52,447
with your head in your hands at your desk under a deadline,

426
00:26:52,447 --> 00:26:56,851
shake off the deadline.

427
00:26:56,851 --> 00:26:57,992
Go for a walk.

428
00:26:57,992 --> 00:27:00,815
Employ a little xiao yao you, go out into the world,

429
00:27:00,815 --> 00:27:02,937
and maybe take some reference images while you're there.

430
00:27:02,937 --> 00:27:06,360
These are some suggested readings.

431
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,284
The Taoist classics, Tao Te Ching and Zhuangzi,

432
00:27:10,284 --> 00:27:13,667
two books by Francois Julien that are directly

433
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:14,748
related to aesthetics.

434
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:19,846
the patterns in nature book by Philip Ball that I mentioned,

435
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:22,287
and that awesome Ryan Brooks blog posts

436
00:27:22,287 --> 00:27:24,268
getting the most set of noise in UE4.

437
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:26,610
Thank you.

438
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:41,339
I think I burned up all the time with that video mishap,

439
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:41,599
but.

440
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:52,163
Okay. Yeah, if anybody has questions, I don't know, maybe the CAs will have an idea of what to do.

441
00:27:52,163 --> 00:27:52,323
Cool.

442
00:27:52,323 --> 00:28:03,294
Oh, do your evaluation, please.

443
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:09,244
Hey Jeremy, so I like to think about things pretty mathematically. I was wondering if

444
00:28:09,244 --> 00:28:14,132
Taoism and mathematics talked to each other much at the time?

445
00:28:14,811 --> 00:28:16,072
I guess.

446
00:28:16,072 --> 00:28:17,713
That's a good question.

447
00:28:17,713 --> 00:28:27,822
I don't know of anything in the source texts, but within the intellectual history of China,

448
00:28:27,822 --> 00:28:34,908
ideas from Daoism played a strong role and interacted with other strains like Tiantai

449
00:28:34,908 --> 00:28:36,929
Buddhism and Chan Buddhism, Zen Buddhism.

450
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:43,174
And these schools tended to be more rigorous,

451
00:28:43,174 --> 00:28:45,655
so there might be something there to look into,

452
00:28:45,655 --> 00:28:46,776
but I don't know off the top of my head.

453
00:28:46,776 --> 00:28:47,176
Okay, thank you.

454
00:28:47,176 --> 00:28:47,476
No problem.

455
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:47,656
Cool.

456
00:28:47,656 --> 00:28:47,837
Seems it.

457
00:28:47,837 --> 00:28:49,718
Thank you so much, everyone.
