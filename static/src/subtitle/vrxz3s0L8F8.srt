1
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,412
So I'll be honest, in my script it says,

2
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:11,953
oh my gosh, I'm so happy to see so many of you

3
00:00:11,993 --> 00:00:12,914
in the audience today.

4
00:00:13,294 --> 00:00:16,075
But I don't know if I can call this a lot of people.

5
00:00:18,036 --> 00:00:20,277
Either way, I'm so grateful and honored

6
00:00:20,377 --> 00:00:22,158
to be a speaker this year at GDC.

7
00:00:26,585 --> 00:00:31,207
I think the interpreter in the booth is not sure which reaction I was supposed to take

8
00:00:31,267 --> 00:00:33,647
because I didn't tell her, but hopefully she got it right.

9
00:00:34,087 --> 00:00:39,529
So thanks for showing up for my session today, for such a niche creator like myself.

10
00:00:48,711 --> 00:00:53,132
So I'd like to know, did any of you attend the GDC Awards last night?

11
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:05,215
Oh, cool. So nice to see that. And you are well aware of who the winners are then.

12
00:01:17,423 --> 00:01:23,067
The best narrative at the 13th Annual Game Developers Choice Awards went to...

13
00:01:23,087 --> 00:01:25,349
Drumroll, drumroll...

14
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:27,130
The Walking Dead!

15
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,140
That's weird, you know.

16
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:42,245
I think it was supposed to say, Virtue's Last Reward, and now it says The Walking Dead.

17
00:01:42,265 --> 00:01:55,572
I promised my wife that I'd bring home an award, so I don't know what excuse I have

18
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:55,793
now.

19
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:10,647
I myself obviously have played The Walking Dead, so I can completely understand why it

20
00:02:10,687 --> 00:02:13,009
won the award, and I'm a huge fan of the game.

21
00:02:20,136 --> 00:02:27,523
Unfortunately, we didn't win for Virtue's Last Reward, a title which I directed and

22
00:02:27,783 --> 00:02:28,724
wrote the story for.

23
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:38,247
But I'm so honored to have been nominated for such a prestigious award alongside some fantastic titles.

24
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:51,777
I'd like to thank all of our staff at Spike Chunsoft, the localization staff at Axis, and all of our fans who supported our title.

25
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,563
And thank you all here for your support.

26
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:17,021
I was fortunate to attend the award ceremony last night, and all the nominated titles are

27
00:03:17,062 --> 00:03:18,802
fantastic in their own way.

28
00:03:20,723 --> 00:03:22,764
Any of them could have taken home an award.

29
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:31,048
But of those, the ones that I'm most interested in, or I've always been interested in, and

30
00:03:31,108 --> 00:03:36,070
already have played, are Journey, The Walking Dead, and The Greatest Showman.

31
00:03:36,652 --> 00:03:46,040
and the room. Do you know what these three have in common? Yes, they're all adventure

32
00:03:46,060 --> 00:04:03,735
games. So, as we just said, The Walking Dead took home Best Narrative.

33
00:04:06,058 --> 00:04:09,440
The Room took home Best Handheld and Mobile.

34
00:04:14,162 --> 00:04:18,244
And Journey, they were nominated in six categories

35
00:04:18,584 --> 00:04:19,945
and won all of them.

36
00:04:21,285 --> 00:04:24,387
And of course, the Game of the Year award also went to Journey.

37
00:04:27,088 --> 00:04:28,689
As you can see from these results,

38
00:04:29,109 --> 00:04:30,470
adventure games are on a roll.

39
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:36,499
It seems as though the fun and adventure games were rediscovered last year thanks to these

40
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:37,900
wonderful games.

41
00:04:53,983 --> 00:04:56,903
So Visual Novel is sort of an adventure game.

42
00:04:56,923 --> 00:05:00,904
It's sort of an adventure game.

43
00:05:03,271 --> 00:05:07,032
as kind of a sub-genre within the adventure game genre.

44
00:05:07,692 --> 00:05:13,073
Our Virtue's Last Reward, or I'm going to say VLR, is, for short, is a visual novel.

45
00:05:16,074 --> 00:05:22,375
Technically speaking, VLR features a lot of puzzles, so it may not be a visual novel in

46
00:05:22,395 --> 00:05:27,816
the purest sense, but it's safe to say that it falls into the genre.

47
00:05:29,016 --> 00:05:30,677
So then, what's a visual novel?

48
00:05:36,407 --> 00:05:39,709
How many of you have played a visual novel?

49
00:05:43,912 --> 00:05:44,412
Oh, great.

50
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:46,153
So glad to see.

51
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:59,040
So then perhaps I don't need to explain what a visual novel is,

52
00:05:59,441 --> 00:06:03,583
but for those who may not be familiar, a visual novel is.

53
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,302
The answer is that there isn't a clear definition of a visual novel.

54
00:06:19,322 --> 00:06:28,226
A video game with visuals, sound, and narrative displayed in text-based form.

55
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:37,595
That could be one possible definition, but even without sound or narrative displayed

56
00:06:37,655 --> 00:06:42,580
in text on screen, you can still call some games a visual novel.

57
00:06:43,481 --> 00:06:45,783
Then what about a game without any visuals?

58
00:06:47,065 --> 00:06:48,266
That wouldn't make any sense.

59
00:06:48,846 --> 00:06:52,070
How can you call a visual novel if it doesn't contain any visuals?

60
00:06:54,072 --> 00:06:55,153
But it is possible.

61
00:06:56,344 --> 00:07:00,686
to create a piece that essentially is the same and

62
00:07:00,786 --> 00:07:04,708
possesses the same principles as a visual novel, even without

63
00:07:04,848 --> 00:07:12,252
using any visuals. Here's an example of a visual novel

64
00:07:12,352 --> 00:07:18,115
without any visual expressions. This is Real Sound, Winds of

65
00:07:18,175 --> 00:07:19,396
Regret, released back in 1997.

66
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,922
This game contains no visuals whatsoever.

67
00:07:24,663 --> 00:07:27,445
The player spends his or her time listening as the story

68
00:07:27,505 --> 00:07:28,006
unfolds.

69
00:07:28,706 --> 00:07:31,729
When there's a fork in the plot, it's up to the player to choose

70
00:07:31,809 --> 00:07:32,769
which course to take.

71
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,892
Once the selection is made, the story continues.

72
00:07:37,253 --> 00:07:39,855
The structure is essentially the same as a visual novel.

73
00:07:40,636 --> 00:07:43,218
And I just use the word essential or essence.

74
00:07:43,498 --> 00:07:47,061
So then what is the essential quality or principle behind a

75
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:47,721
visual novel?

76
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,993
Watch on screen, the essential quality of a visual novel.

77
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:06,198
A video game with visual, sound, and narrative displayed in text-based form.

78
00:08:06,818 --> 00:08:13,003
And now, you just saw that the two words that remain are narrative and video game.

79
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:19,388
Put simply, a video game with narrative is essential quality of a visual novel.

80
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:32,694
A game with narrative sounds like pretty much any game out there, from Super Mario Brothers

81
00:08:32,754 --> 00:08:34,515
to, I mean, pretty much anything.

82
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,197
Well, maybe Tetris is an exception.

83
00:08:38,077 --> 00:08:39,258
You're all probably thinking.

84
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,041
So then, let me rephrase what I meant.

85
00:08:49,845 --> 00:08:52,827
It's a video game that weighs heavily on narrative.

86
00:08:56,677 --> 00:09:00,179
The essential quality of a visual novel lies in heavy narrative.

87
00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:04,563
However, just because it's narrative heavy, you can't call it a visual novel, since that

88
00:09:04,603 --> 00:09:12,369
would also apply to film, anime, manga, novels, and so on.

89
00:09:12,669 --> 00:09:17,293
At the same time, you can't just add the word game or the game element to something and

90
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:22,417
call it a visual novel, as would also include things like paperback adventure game books.

91
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:26,201
In sum, there are two elements that make up the essential

92
00:09:26,241 --> 00:09:29,862
quality of a visual novel, a heavy narrative and a video

93
00:09:29,882 --> 00:09:30,102
game.

94
00:09:37,824 --> 00:09:41,264
So let me step away from visual novels for a second here and

95
00:09:41,304 --> 00:09:47,885
talk about sports. Are football and baseball sports? Of course

96
00:09:47,925 --> 00:09:50,866
they are. Then what about darts?

97
00:09:53,633 --> 00:10:05,800
and pool? How about motor racing, shooting, and fishing? And yes, fishing. What about

98
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:16,706
lingerie football? I don't know about you guys, but I say these are all sports because

99
00:10:16,806 --> 00:10:18,567
they require to be athletic.

100
00:10:20,744 --> 00:10:27,847
However, some people may disagree in a similar way that some people think visual novels are

101
00:10:27,887 --> 00:10:28,527
not games.

102
00:10:37,391 --> 00:10:41,313
So, is a visual novel a game or not?

103
00:10:44,974 --> 00:10:45,575
If it isn'tâ€¦

104
00:10:46,275 --> 00:10:50,757
I would have to go back and re-examine the essential qualities of what makes a visual

105
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:51,157
novel.

106
00:10:53,178 --> 00:10:55,599
I'm going to go ahead and answer the question for us.

107
00:11:03,342 --> 00:11:04,843
A visual novel is a game.

108
00:11:06,963 --> 00:11:11,525
Similar to how darts and fishing are sports, a visual novel is a game.

109
00:11:13,074 --> 00:11:16,897
But why and how and what exactly is a game then?

110
00:11:16,917 --> 00:11:20,979
If being athletic and having great reflexes

111
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,942
defines what a sport is, then what is a game?

112
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,949
A game is something with selectivity, is what I think.

113
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,810
To be more specific.

114
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,483
Something where the selection made by the player's decision

115
00:11:42,783 --> 00:11:45,306
changes the history of events or outcome

116
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:48,169
that takes place within a given set of rules.

117
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,052
Does that make sense?

118
00:11:52,073 --> 00:11:53,555
Well, let me just give you an example.

119
00:12:03,475 --> 00:12:07,539
In Tetris, the player selects how to move the falling blocks

120
00:12:08,099 --> 00:12:10,101
based on a specific set of rules.

121
00:12:11,262 --> 00:12:13,344
Depending on the selection made by the player,

122
00:12:13,364 --> 00:12:17,567
the blocks below changes its form.

123
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:22,371
This outcome you see is a result of the player's decision

124
00:12:22,852 --> 00:12:24,994
coming into play with the events

125
00:12:25,094 --> 00:12:26,575
that are displayed on screen.

126
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:31,499
It's the same with a game of chess.

127
00:12:32,545 --> 00:12:38,646
The player selects how to move the piece based on a given rule, and by doing so, the events

128
00:12:38,786 --> 00:12:41,987
or the history of what's taking place on the board is changed.

129
00:12:42,707 --> 00:12:44,687
So that is why chess is also a game.

130
00:12:46,048 --> 00:12:52,829
Darts, poker, tennis, boxing, Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed, Metal Gear, all these are

131
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:53,249
games.

132
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,791
Oh, of course, and so is lingerie football.

133
00:13:02,596 --> 00:13:03,116
And why?

134
00:13:03,877 --> 00:13:06,799
Because the selection made by the player's decision

135
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,422
changes the history of events taking place

136
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,103
within a given set of rules.

137
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:16,627
If that's the case, we can say that life is a game too.

138
00:13:18,049 --> 00:13:22,893
Because in life, there are rules and selectivity.

139
00:13:26,175 --> 00:13:28,938
It looks like you guys made the right choice or decision

140
00:13:29,078 --> 00:13:32,300
because you are here today listening to me speak.

141
00:13:46,153 --> 00:13:50,316
A game specializing in selectivity, that's a visual novel.

142
00:13:51,877 --> 00:13:58,423
In that sense, I believe it's a category of games in its purest form, a primitive game.

143
00:13:59,243 --> 00:14:04,187
As you know, except for some rare ones, the majority of visual novels have some form of

144
00:14:04,227 --> 00:14:04,908
selectivity.

145
00:14:05,853 --> 00:14:09,935
They are generally displayed in the form of a selection or choice.

146
00:14:10,655 --> 00:14:16,538
This is where visual novels differ from film, anime, manga, and novels.

147
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:20,360
They might all have narratives, but they don't have selectivity.

148
00:14:21,081 --> 00:14:25,263
The viewer or reader is unable to step into the story at will.

149
00:14:26,023 --> 00:14:28,385
This is the biggest strength for visual novels.

150
00:14:39,014 --> 00:14:43,817
In Japan, visual novels have naturally evolved and developed over time.

151
00:14:45,378 --> 00:14:51,282
Similar to the giant tortoise in the Galapagos Islands, it has evolved in its own unique

152
00:14:51,322 --> 00:14:54,604
way domestically in a closed environment.

153
00:14:57,757 --> 00:15:03,419
And like Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, perhaps someone in the audience will uncover

154
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,281
an eccentric idea as well.

155
00:15:09,682 --> 00:15:15,424
The first example is Steins Gate, a visual novel released in 2009 by 5PB Games.

156
00:15:19,382 --> 00:15:22,066
This game does not have any selections or choices.

157
00:15:22,366 --> 00:15:25,210
Instead, there is a selectivity element

158
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:27,674
where you can either choose to send an email

159
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:29,136
from your mobile phone or not.

160
00:15:29,536 --> 00:15:32,000
Depending on your selection, the plot changes.

161
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:42,690
The following year in 2010, our company released a game called Danganronpa, Academy of Hope

162
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,491
and High School Students of Despair.

163
00:15:45,191 --> 00:15:49,874
It is a murder mystery adventure game with a school trial at the center of the story.

164
00:15:50,814 --> 00:15:54,876
The game manages to perfectly blend the action and the heated debates.

165
00:15:55,877 --> 00:16:01,740
And aside from the trial section of the game, the game progresses in a visual novel manner.

166
00:16:03,135 --> 00:16:05,616
There are many other visual novels with great stories,

167
00:16:05,956 --> 00:16:09,417
philosophical ones, emotional ones, well written mysteries and

168
00:16:09,477 --> 00:16:14,398
human drama. So many to name, but there is one work that

169
00:16:14,518 --> 00:16:16,679
pioneered the visual novel movement.

170
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:29,462
And that is Kamaitachi no Yoru, translated as the night of the

171
00:16:29,502 --> 00:16:30,142
sickle weasel.

172
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:37,994
This is actually a game developed by Chunsoft before we merged with Spike and became the

173
00:16:38,054 --> 00:16:38,895
current company.

174
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:46,681
The original release was in 1994, about 20 years ago, on the SNES.

175
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:58,491
It is a visual novel, and the plot revolves around two characters who are suddenly drawn

176
00:16:58,631 --> 00:17:01,633
into a horrible murder mystery at a skiing lodge.

177
00:17:02,508 --> 00:17:05,469
You are to solve the mystery and find the murderer.

178
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:09,610
There is one unique thing about this game.

179
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,751
That is that it doesn't use any flags.

180
00:17:24,814 --> 00:17:28,535
I'm sure everyone here knows what I mean by a flag.

181
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,396
Yes, it's the flag used in computer programming.

182
00:17:34,236 --> 00:17:36,118
Are you going to flirt with Naomi?

183
00:17:36,438 --> 00:17:38,439
If yes, the variable is true.

184
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,881
If no, it will be false.

185
00:17:41,462 --> 00:17:44,384
Soon after, you find out Naomi is your boss's mistress.

186
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:48,167
So if you chose false, you'll be promoted.

187
00:17:48,948 --> 00:17:51,370
But if you chose true, you'll be fired.

188
00:17:56,835 --> 00:17:58,356
That's a quick example of a flag.

189
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,121
After asking around the development team members who worked on Kamaitachi no Yoru,

190
00:18:08,661 --> 00:18:10,961
it looks like they didn't really use any flags.

191
00:18:14,322 --> 00:18:19,503
If so, how were they able to create branching storylines without losing consistency?

192
00:18:21,244 --> 00:18:25,385
Well, in fact, there are a couple different ways to approach this, but today, I'm going

193
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:27,425
to talk about the most interesting method.

194
00:18:34,098 --> 00:18:38,619
In Kamaitachi no Yoru, the flags were embedded into the player's brain.

195
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:43,580
So what exactly does this mean, you're probably thinking.

196
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,701
Don't worry, I'll explain what it means.

197
00:18:56,943 --> 00:18:59,783
Here's a snapshot of the branching narrative structure.

198
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:04,546
At point X, the dead body is discovered.

199
00:19:07,587 --> 00:19:11,429
Next, at point Y, this is where you

200
00:19:11,509 --> 00:19:12,909
enter the name of the murderer.

201
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:19,211
This comes up pretty early in the game.

202
00:19:23,753 --> 00:19:26,033
If you have the correct answer, in other words,

203
00:19:26,093 --> 00:19:28,914
if you're able to guess the murderer and you're right,

204
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:31,095
you'll get the good ending, which is A.

205
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:36,952
However, in most cases, you haven't collect enough clues

206
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:40,035
to guess the murderer on the first try.

207
00:19:43,339 --> 00:19:45,701
So players will end up passing through Y

208
00:19:45,721 --> 00:19:54,430
and get to endings B, C, D, and so on.

209
00:19:56,904 --> 00:20:02,647
Unfortunately, those have tragic endings where all the characters are murdered, or you end

210
00:20:02,707 --> 00:20:07,590
up killing the heroine by mistake, and even vice versa.

211
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:19,257
In order to avoid these endings, the players must return to point Y and enter the correct

212
00:20:19,398 --> 00:20:19,698
answer.

213
00:20:22,986 --> 00:20:28,329
But to do that, the player must collect hints and clues along the way that lead to those

214
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:31,551
tragic B, C, and D endings.

215
00:20:36,974 --> 00:20:42,938
Once you've gathered enough clues and are ready to solve the case, you return to point

216
00:20:43,258 --> 00:20:43,338
Y.

217
00:20:44,178 --> 00:20:46,620
That's the basic flow in Kamaidachi no Yoru.

218
00:20:49,018 --> 00:20:54,022
The interesting thing about this float is that they're not using a flag at point Y.

219
00:20:54,042 --> 00:21:02,090
In any ordinary visual novel, it would work like this.

220
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:09,416
You have a flag at B, and a flag at C, and a flag at D. Once you've gotten through all

221
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:15,081
the flags, point Y will unlock, and you'll get the good ending at A.

222
00:21:18,137 --> 00:21:20,538
However, that's not how it works in this game.

223
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:29,661
In an extreme case, if you're able to guess the correct name during your first playthrough,

224
00:21:31,122 --> 00:21:38,605
you'll get the good A ending without having to have to go through endings B, C, and D.

225
00:21:41,246 --> 00:21:44,867
So if there is no flag at point Y, what took its place?

226
00:21:46,852 --> 00:21:50,634
The answer is the memory that was embedded in the player's brain.

227
00:22:05,065 --> 00:22:08,348
Once the player gathers clues on path.

228
00:22:08,947 --> 00:22:15,873
B, C, and D, the main character of the game was able to go back to point Y and give the

229
00:22:15,913 --> 00:22:19,196
correct answer, thanks to the player's own memory.

230
00:22:20,837 --> 00:22:25,861
Normally in visual novels, that memory is stored onto the computer's memory as a piece

231
00:22:25,901 --> 00:22:26,381
of data.

232
00:22:28,163 --> 00:22:31,205
For example, were the clues picked up in path B?

233
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:32,006
True.

234
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:33,847
What about in path C?

235
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:34,508
True.

236
00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:35,649
And D?

237
00:22:36,249 --> 00:22:36,470
True.

238
00:22:37,796 --> 00:22:42,138
Once those conditions are met, the main character is able to proceed to path A.

239
00:22:42,918 --> 00:22:46,620
However, in this game, the developers of Kaimaitachi no Yoru

240
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,342
use the player's brain to store the memory and not the computer.

241
00:23:03,517 --> 00:23:09,518
Using the player's brain as the computer's memory, this is what's unique about Kamaitachi

242
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:15,319
no Yoru and what differentiates this game from other visual novels that came after it.

243
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:21,781
I sense a lot of old school gamers reacting to this, telling me that all adventure games

244
00:23:21,861 --> 00:23:23,801
from the early days did the same thing.

245
00:23:25,022 --> 00:23:25,502
And they're 100% correct.

246
00:23:30,673 --> 00:23:35,474
It is true that back in the days when playing adventure games, you would have to take notes

247
00:23:35,774 --> 00:23:40,996
of passwords or clues or even draw a simple map for yourself.

248
00:23:44,277 --> 00:23:48,899
The memory capacity needed to play those games existed in our own brain.

249
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:57,622
However, as consoles and technology evolved, that information was stored on the computer.

250
00:24:00,842 --> 00:24:02,043
I mean, who wouldn't want that?

251
00:24:02,604 --> 00:24:08,308
Playing games become a bit easier, less stressful, fun, and accessible.

252
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:09,269
Don't you think?

253
00:24:12,191 --> 00:24:16,494
For visual novels, we're seeing more games adapt that style, where

254
00:24:16,534 --> 00:24:18,256
they're frequently using flags.

255
00:24:19,317 --> 00:24:23,460
Therefore, from our standpoint, Kamaitachi no Yoru is different, and

256
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,361
at the same time, feels very fresh.

257
00:24:32,882 --> 00:24:39,688
There is a Japanese proverb, Onko Chishin, which means to discover new things by taking

258
00:24:39,748 --> 00:24:40,889
lessons from the past.

259
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:44,732
Kamaitachi no Yoru is exactly that.

260
00:24:46,113 --> 00:24:50,117
It is a game that teaches us the importance of Onko Chishin.

261
00:24:59,678 --> 00:25:02,479
So I talked in length about Kamaitachi no Yoru,

262
00:25:02,659 --> 00:25:06,401
and you're probably wondering what it has to do with VLR.

263
00:25:08,062 --> 00:25:09,442
Well, there is a connection.

264
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:11,363
And if you've already played VLR,

265
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:13,264
you may have already noticed something.

266
00:25:18,986 --> 00:25:22,048
In VLR, you are prompted to enter a password

267
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:25,810
at certain points, like when you need to start up a computer

268
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:28,811
or you have to deactivate a bomb, and so on.

269
00:25:31,407 --> 00:25:32,548
Take a look at this flow.

270
00:25:33,028 --> 00:25:37,691
You pick up a password on path B and enter it into device Y.

271
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:42,913
Do the same on path C and enter into Z1, path D,

272
00:25:43,494 --> 00:25:44,794
and enter into Z2.

273
00:25:46,435 --> 00:25:49,737
Eventually, you'll have unlocked Y and Z's

274
00:25:49,957 --> 00:25:51,618
and proceed further into the game.

275
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,200
This isn't throughout the entire game,

276
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,921
but it comes up plenty of times.

277
00:25:58,201 --> 00:26:00,823
And we're not using any flags at these points.

278
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:12,977
The player embeds the information he or she collected on these paths as memories in their

279
00:26:13,017 --> 00:26:17,379
brain and enters them into devices Y and Z.

280
00:26:19,099 --> 00:26:24,701
The original idea of this comes from Kamaitachi no Yoru and the method they used.

281
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:33,043
So, as with that game, if a player ends up searching for passwords for Y and Z somewhere

282
00:26:33,063 --> 00:26:39,508
online or a strategy guide, they can simply enter that and advance in the game without

283
00:26:39,608 --> 00:26:44,451
going through B, C, or D. What do you think?

284
00:26:44,972 --> 00:26:45,712
Pretty interesting.

285
00:26:55,552 --> 00:27:03,894
Since the title of this session is Narrative Design and Virtue's Last Reward, I assume

286
00:27:03,974 --> 00:27:09,035
many of you here today have an interest in story writing and storytelling.

287
00:27:16,796 --> 00:27:20,517
So in using the remaining time, I'd like to share some of my techniques.

288
00:27:21,925 --> 00:27:24,026
It's nothing extraordinary or special.

289
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:31,409
So I don't know if you call these techniques, but for me,

290
00:27:32,029 --> 00:27:35,211
it begins with a sense of discomfort.

291
00:27:37,592 --> 00:27:41,033
This is what I use as a foundation for whenever I design

292
00:27:41,073 --> 00:27:42,634
a game or write a narrative.

293
00:27:44,014 --> 00:27:46,696
I'm inspired by it and everything begins from here.

294
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:50,157
I'm going to bring back Kamaitachi no Yoru for a second

295
00:27:50,197 --> 00:27:50,337
here.

296
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,661
Here's a flowchart for Kamaitachi no Yoru.

297
00:28:05,802 --> 00:28:08,803
When I was explaining this earlier, did you notice anything?

298
00:28:09,884 --> 00:28:17,828
I said this, the player will pick up hints and clues along paths B, C, D, and return

299
00:28:17,868 --> 00:28:20,349
to Y and enter the murderer's name.

300
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:25,572
However, if you think about it, that can't be right.

301
00:28:27,093 --> 00:28:32,316
Point Y exists above Path B, C, and D.

302
00:28:33,196 --> 00:28:34,777
It existed in the past.

303
00:28:38,099 --> 00:28:41,641
Therefore, at Point Y, the main character of the game,

304
00:28:42,182 --> 00:28:47,385
his name is Toru, doesn't know, or rather can't know

305
00:28:47,465 --> 00:28:50,567
what happened in Path B, C, and D.

306
00:28:51,487 --> 00:28:53,208
Those events happen in the future.

307
00:28:56,999 --> 00:29:01,483
But Toru is able to enter the name at point Y when he returns.

308
00:29:02,785 --> 00:29:03,385
Why is that?

309
00:29:06,108 --> 00:29:07,970
I'm sure you know the answer, it's obvious.

310
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:11,414
It's because the player, not the main character in the game,

311
00:29:12,095 --> 00:29:15,598
knew about the events in paths B, C and D.

312
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:17,220
Interesting, right?

313
00:29:18,916 --> 00:29:23,279
The player had information that the main character Toru didn't have.

314
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:28,322
Therefore, Toru, the player's alter ego, knew the answer.

315
00:29:35,342 --> 00:29:36,282
How do you solve this?

316
00:29:36,802 --> 00:29:37,403
It's simple.

317
00:29:38,183 --> 00:29:41,045
What you do is you give the main character in the game

318
00:29:41,325 --> 00:29:42,846
the same ability you have.

319
00:29:43,006 --> 00:29:45,467
In other words, you allow the character

320
00:29:45,787 --> 00:29:48,849
to move freely between the past, future,

321
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,210
and different timelines in the past.

322
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:06,373
This is how the VLR flowchart came to be.

323
00:30:08,115 --> 00:30:10,077
Well, to be honest, it's the other way around.

324
00:30:10,097 --> 00:30:16,183
In the prequel, 999, nine hours, nine persons, nine doors,

325
00:30:16,844 --> 00:30:18,125
we didn't have a flowchart.

326
00:30:19,226 --> 00:30:21,168
Some of our fans didn't like that.

327
00:30:21,409 --> 00:30:24,912
So we decided from the beginning that VLR would have one.

328
00:30:29,437 --> 00:30:32,277
But it's no fun just including a flow chart just

329
00:30:32,317 --> 00:30:33,498
to have it in there, right?

330
00:30:36,259 --> 00:30:39,239
So I started thinking of ways to incorporate a story

331
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,640
element into the chart.

332
00:30:42,901 --> 00:30:46,582
That's when the confusion or discomfort of Kamaitachi no

333
00:30:46,602 --> 00:30:48,782
Yoru became the source of inspiration.

334
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:08,304
In addition, in both VLR and 999, there are various elements in the game which were inspired

335
00:31:08,384 --> 00:31:11,867
by this element of discomfort or confusion.

336
00:31:14,088 --> 00:31:19,571
For example, the discomfort you feel in, let's say, first-person perspective and third-person

337
00:31:19,631 --> 00:31:20,312
perspective.

338
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:24,914
I won't go into the details, as I know not all of you may have played VLR and 999.

339
00:31:26,646 --> 00:31:32,087
However, I will say that the discomfort you get from playing a third-person perspective game

340
00:31:32,407 --> 00:31:38,008
and seeing yourself in the screen is what creates the unique qualities in these games.

341
00:31:42,429 --> 00:31:45,130
You probably know what I mean by this if you played the game.

342
00:31:57,105 --> 00:32:02,256
I hate to keep repeating myself, but that sense of discomfort is very important.

343
00:32:03,939 --> 00:32:06,243
It's a trigger point for me in writing this story.

344
00:32:12,512 --> 00:32:16,656
I suppose you can say it's very similar to having doubts about the conventional thought,

345
00:32:17,316 --> 00:32:20,899
or me telling you, do not blindly trust the common knowledge.

346
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:26,704
For example, in most action adventure games and RPGs, your main character carries several

347
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:32,670
weapons along with other gear and equipment, even though visually and on screen, you can

348
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,972
only see one type of what they have equipped.

349
00:32:36,933 --> 00:32:38,395
And in various parts of the map.

350
00:32:39,411 --> 00:32:44,034
You can pick up ammo, healing items, and will get coins or money when you defeat your enemies.

351
00:32:45,815 --> 00:32:48,396
In reality, that doesn't happen, and it's not natural.

352
00:32:48,537 --> 00:32:50,037
But in games, it's typical.

353
00:32:50,158 --> 00:32:51,899
It's a given, and we don't question that.

354
00:32:52,459 --> 00:32:53,319
And that's the standard.

355
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,142
It's right here where there's actually a hidden trick.

356
00:32:58,102 --> 00:33:02,865
Does anyone know who or what I'm talking about?

357
00:33:16,018 --> 00:33:21,121
So, I just said that equipping several weapons and picking up ammo at specific locations

358
00:33:21,982 --> 00:33:23,262
is unnatural in real life.

359
00:33:23,302 --> 00:33:24,743
It just doesn't happen that way.

360
00:33:26,865 --> 00:33:29,926
But players have accepted it without questioning why.

361
00:33:30,807 --> 00:33:32,108
Why is it so in games?

362
00:33:33,309 --> 00:33:36,090
Simple answer, because the game is much more fun that way.

363
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:42,361
There are people who argue that these settings are not realistic and you wouldn't encounter

364
00:33:42,441 --> 00:33:44,202
such situations in real life.

365
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:46,784
But I think that's nonsense.

366
00:33:47,664 --> 00:33:52,667
We shouldn't be that obsessed with reality and games where it becomes too excessive.

367
00:33:56,749 --> 00:34:01,591
A real world where true reality exists is the world we live in.

368
00:34:03,114 --> 00:34:06,915
And this world is a world where the level design is broken,

369
00:34:07,195 --> 00:34:10,076
and there are all kinds of bugs all over the place.

370
00:34:10,917 --> 00:34:13,177
Don't you agree that it's a pretty boring world?

371
00:34:15,518 --> 00:34:18,359
What's so entertaining about recreating a world

372
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:20,760
full of absurdity in games?

373
00:34:25,701 --> 00:34:28,702
Games are fun because they are set in an imaginary world.

374
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:32,951
What's important to games isn't the real reality,

375
00:34:33,191 --> 00:34:34,651
but a reality for games.

376
00:34:35,332 --> 00:34:38,393
It's the reality that is according to rules in games.

377
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:56,619
In closing, I like to circle back to the top of this session.

378
00:34:58,667 --> 00:35:02,868
Of the games that were nominated this year at the Game Developers' Choice Awards,

379
00:35:03,709 --> 00:35:09,531
I'm most interested in these three titles, Journey, The Walking Dead, and The Room.

380
00:35:11,652 --> 00:35:13,053
And what do they have in common?

381
00:35:14,834 --> 00:35:16,374
All three are adventure games.

382
00:35:18,835 --> 00:35:21,497
But I think there's one more thing they have in common.

383
00:35:23,938 --> 00:35:26,899
They're all digitally distributed games.

384
00:35:31,742 --> 00:35:34,922
The Room is available on the iPhone and iPad.

385
00:35:36,423 --> 00:35:41,944
The Walking Dead is a multi-platform title that's also available on the iPhone and iPad.

386
00:35:42,705 --> 00:35:45,485
And Journey is a downloadable PS3 game.

387
00:35:47,466 --> 00:35:51,647
I think it's safe to conclude that adventure games work well on smartphones.

388
00:36:01,762 --> 00:36:07,363
Most people these days all own smartphones, and I believe that adventure games is a game

389
00:36:07,423 --> 00:36:11,624
genre that is very well fitted or fitting to smartphones.

390
00:36:17,365 --> 00:36:27,728
Adventure games, similar to novels, films, TV drama, manga, and anime, is a new way to

391
00:36:27,968 --> 00:36:28,668
tell a story.

392
00:36:31,347 --> 00:36:39,532
I'm hopeful that we will see amazing adventure games released across digital platforms in

393
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,092
the future.

394
00:36:40,353 --> 00:36:41,533
I'm looking forward to them.

395
00:36:48,217 --> 00:36:55,362
And hopefully, one of you guys here will help us create that amazing game in the future.

396
00:36:57,123 --> 00:37:00,605
If I can be of any assistance, that would make me very happy.

397
00:37:01,743 --> 00:37:04,325
Thank you for listening to my session today.

398
00:37:17,692 --> 00:37:21,074
So we have about 15 minutes for a Q&A session.

399
00:37:21,094 --> 00:37:22,875
There are two mics.

400
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:31,975
So please walk up, step up to the mic and ask the question.

401
00:37:33,096 --> 00:37:35,318
Hi, may I start now?

402
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:37,721
Yes, go ahead.

403
00:37:38,382 --> 00:37:44,188
Hi, I'm a big fan of Chunsoft and I play 428, 999 and VLR. I love all of them.

404
00:37:44,989 --> 00:37:46,070
So my question here is about...

405
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:51,444
why you decided to make VLR a sequel to 999.

406
00:37:51,724 --> 00:37:52,224
It sounds the...

407
00:37:52,665 --> 00:37:55,547
It seems that the ending of 999 is almost perfect,

408
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:58,910
but you decided to expand the universe of that game,

409
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:03,613
and it seems now you're making 999 a trilogy right now.

410
00:38:03,874 --> 00:38:05,075
So what is the reason of that?

411
00:38:55,721 --> 00:38:55,941
Um...

412
00:38:56,181 --> 00:39:02,708
Excuse me, um...

413
00:39:02,789 --> 00:39:03,710
The questions...

414
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:04,330
Um...

415
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:04,831
Ah, first...

416
00:39:04,851 --> 00:39:07,694
Thank you very much.

417
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:19,213
I thought about why I wanted to continue making 999 and VRR games.

418
00:39:33,409 --> 00:39:44,558
First of all, when 999 was released, it received a very high rating, especially in North America.

419
00:39:44,618 --> 00:39:49,522
As a result, we decided to make a sequel.

420
00:39:49,542 --> 00:39:53,586
At the time, we were planning to make a sequel with DS.

421
00:40:01,453 --> 00:40:01,993
I thought that.

422
00:40:02,294 --> 00:40:03,736
If you're going to make it in DS,

423
00:40:03,756 --> 00:40:06,920
it's more efficient to make 2 and 3 at the same time.

424
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,521
So, parallel 2 and 3,

425
00:40:15,643 --> 00:40:18,884
We had the initial idea of making a 3D platform.

426
00:40:18,924 --> 00:40:20,765
But as you all know, 3DS and Vita,

427
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:23,446
the new platforms have been coming out,

428
00:40:23,526 --> 00:40:24,566
and we had to change the hardware.

429
00:40:24,586 --> 00:40:26,186
So we decided to make 2D alone,

430
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:27,527
and then make 3D.

431
00:40:44,216 --> 00:40:47,679
This is how we decided to do it.

432
00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:47,879
And...

433
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,343
So when we developed version 2 and 3,

434
00:40:52,503 --> 00:40:55,646
we had already made copies of the first.

435
00:41:09,499 --> 00:41:12,159
2 and 3 were already in my head as a set of things.

436
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:18,001
So that is one of the reasons why 2 is connected to the sequel.

437
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:20,922
And 0, the Escape series, is now a series.

438
00:41:20,942 --> 00:41:21,782
I think that is one of the reasons.

439
00:41:39,445 --> 00:41:41,526
I wanted to listen to the entire answer first.

440
00:41:42,547 --> 00:41:49,913
So 999 was released in Japan, both in Japan and North America, and it was very well received

441
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:55,378
out here in North America, thanks to everyone here and our fans.

442
00:41:55,918 --> 00:42:00,762
And as a result, it was natural for us to start thinking about a sequel.

443
00:42:01,303 --> 00:42:06,807
Originally, we were planning on developing the sequel on the DS, and in doing so...

444
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:14,665
we had an idea that we would go ahead and sort of work on a second one and a third one

445
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:19,494
simultaneously that, you know, developing it would be a lot more efficient that way.

446
00:42:21,088 --> 00:42:26,251
And while we were doing that, obviously the 3DS was announced and came out.

447
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,253
The Vita was also announced.

448
00:42:28,373 --> 00:42:34,937
So we had to sort of make a decision as to which platforms we were going to release this

449
00:42:34,997 --> 00:42:35,497
game on.

450
00:42:36,358 --> 00:42:38,439
And at the same time...

451
00:42:39,451 --> 00:42:47,737
even though we had, you know, planned for two and three, slowly but surely we

452
00:42:47,777 --> 00:42:53,701
started thinking of that as a set. And so that was, in my head, two and three sort

453
00:42:53,741 --> 00:43:01,247
of became a two-in-one type of setting or a package, I guess, a combo. And so it

454
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:06,511
was a natural sort of way for us to say that this was going to be our next step.

455
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:08,092
And then from there it's...

456
00:43:08,792 --> 00:43:13,917
sort of continue on the same path that, okay, now we can, you know, support this as a series.

457
00:43:19,662 --> 00:43:26,188
Good afternoon. It seems to me that a lot of the more recent visual novel hits,

458
00:43:26,809 --> 00:43:32,434
things like Higurashi no Naku Koro ni come from the doujin scene.

459
00:43:33,355 --> 00:43:38,380
Sort of Japan's equivalent of the indie gaming scene. I'm wondering do you think that?

460
00:43:39,341 --> 00:43:41,704
The observation is accurate and what do you think?

461
00:43:42,084 --> 00:43:48,251
Doujin games can offer to visual novel the whole visual novel genre going into the future

462
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:54,844
Yes, I understand. First, I will repeat the content of your question.

463
00:44:54,864 --> 00:45:01,369
There is a situation where a doujin game like The Crying Colony is gaining popularity,

464
00:45:18,177 --> 00:45:24,399
It's a situation where both sides are getting excited.

465
00:45:24,459 --> 00:45:30,782
Is there a possibility that such a doujin game will continue to develop in the future?

466
00:45:55,977 --> 00:45:56,377
Uh...

467
00:45:57,498 --> 00:45:58,138
For Visual Novel...

468
00:45:58,178 --> 00:46:00,099
Visual...

469
00:46:00,399 --> 00:46:01,279
Sorry.

470
00:46:02,839 --> 00:46:05,040
Will Visual Novel 2 develop?

471
00:46:51,641 --> 00:46:55,583
It's a long one.

472
00:46:55,603 --> 00:46:56,484
Can I answer this?

473
00:46:56,504 --> 00:46:57,564
I don't want to repeat myself.

474
00:47:13,157 --> 00:47:15,940
In Japan, there is a comic market called Comiket.

475
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,282
There, you can buy Doujin games and magazines.

476
00:47:26,013 --> 00:47:30,215
and many people have participated in making it.

477
00:47:30,255 --> 00:47:36,799
As a result, more and more interesting games and stories have been created in the indie industry.

478
00:47:36,999 --> 00:47:41,201
We hope that more and more indie games will be created in the future.

479
00:47:51,479 --> 00:47:54,543
I'm sure that from now on his business will change.

480
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:57,466
I'm sure that from now on his business will change.

481
00:47:57,486 --> 00:48:00,809
I'm sure that from now on his business will change.

482
00:48:00,869 --> 00:48:03,012
I'm sure that from now on his business will change.

483
00:48:09,362 --> 00:48:14,285
For example, you can create and distribute your own apps on your phone.

484
00:48:14,345 --> 00:48:18,588
And if you do that, you can create your own apps without the help of a company.

485
00:48:32,786 --> 00:48:35,107
I think we were talking about visual novels.

486
00:48:35,127 --> 00:48:37,809
Not only visual novels, but all other genres, including games,

487
00:48:37,849 --> 00:48:40,250
used to be quite popular, including musicians,

488
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:42,752
as well as individuals of liberals,

489
00:48:42,772 --> 00:48:49,276
leading to a number of illegal acts against Ð¿Ñ‹Ñ‚ÐºÐ¸ JK.

490
00:49:02,386 --> 00:49:06,119
I think he has a lot of potential.

491
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:17,705
So in Japan, as you may know, there's a Comiken, the comic market, and you know, the participants

492
00:49:17,745 --> 00:49:23,388
in the community is growing, I think, at a pretty nice pace, and a lot of new ideas and

493
00:49:23,428 --> 00:49:28,031
games and stories are coming out from that community.

494
00:49:28,951 --> 00:49:37,016
And as you just mentioned, you know, the Japanese sort of indie game development scene can probably

495
00:49:37,036 --> 00:49:37,776
work.

496
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:44,797
that scene is probably getting a lot of influence and maybe even, you know, ideas

497
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:53,704
are being exchanged. So from there, there may be games, ideas that may even prove

498
00:49:53,744 --> 00:49:58,207
to be commercially successful and not just in a very small, you know, tight-knit

499
00:49:58,227 --> 00:50:04,352
community. In addition to that, you know, as we now know on smartphones, tablets,

500
00:50:04,412 --> 00:50:07,234
and whatnot, we can all...

501
00:50:08,235 --> 00:50:15,377
if we want to release content, we don't have to go the route of finding a large company

502
00:50:15,437 --> 00:50:18,298
or publisher to publish our creations.

503
00:50:18,458 --> 00:50:26,381
And so in that sense, you know, even without a company's support, indies or doujin, whatever

504
00:50:26,441 --> 00:50:28,881
their new creations, new ideas and unique.

505
00:50:29,802 --> 00:50:35,825
you know, games and stories, however they want to push it out, it is becoming a very,

506
00:50:36,125 --> 00:50:38,686
you know, possible scenario for many people.

507
00:50:39,307 --> 00:50:46,350
And so, not limited to visual novels, the genre, I think you'll start to see, I think

508
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:48,571
we're going to start to see a little bit more movement.

509
00:50:49,572 --> 00:50:52,073
And so with that, yes, I think the visual novel.

510
00:50:53,094 --> 00:50:58,356
genre will grow and see potential, but at the same time, other genres will

511
00:50:58,376 --> 00:51:05,039
hopefully grow and have some new ideas, new fresh ideas come from the doujin

512
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,601
and indie community.

513
00:51:11,843 --> 00:51:13,543
Okay, this is going to be the last question.

514
00:51:14,795 --> 00:51:17,977
The discomfort thing that you were talking about while writing VLR.

515
00:51:18,397 --> 00:51:22,319
My question was, there is a part at the end, without spoiling it,

516
00:51:22,659 --> 00:51:25,681
where you realize an interesting part about the main character.

517
00:51:26,101 --> 00:51:29,823
That and the fact that you also realize something interesting about the previous

518
00:51:29,843 --> 00:51:33,305
game's main character, which is also kind of discomforting to the player.

519
00:51:33,666 --> 00:51:38,268
Was that kind of going in with your theme of discomfort when you were writing about those things?

520
00:52:30,225 --> 00:52:31,005
Well, um...

521
00:52:31,025 --> 00:52:38,208
well, your question was about that there could be spoilers,

522
00:52:38,228 --> 00:52:40,629
so it was at very long distance

523
00:52:40,649 --> 00:52:40,909
Well, um...

524
00:52:40,929 --> 00:52:41,849
Well, um...

525
00:52:56,715 --> 00:53:01,718
I don't know if what he's saying is the same as what I'm thinking, but I think that feeling is correct.

526
00:53:01,738 --> 00:53:07,321
Please look forward to the next one.

527
00:53:20,128 --> 00:53:28,096
The short answer is yes, that was definitely where I wanted to take the players.

528
00:53:28,176 --> 00:53:29,357
That was my intention.

529
00:53:30,318 --> 00:53:38,986
And so if you sense that discomfort and it was communicated, then I've probably done

530
00:53:39,186 --> 00:53:41,168
my job or I've achieved my goal.

531
00:53:41,308 --> 00:53:45,632
So yes, I definitely wanted that to come through.

532
00:53:54,216 --> 00:53:55,417
So, thank you for listening.
