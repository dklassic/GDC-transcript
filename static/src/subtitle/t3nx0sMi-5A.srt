1
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:06,933
Hi everybody, thank you very much for coming today.

2
00:00:07,553 --> 00:00:09,734
I'll start with a quick overview of what we're going to talk about.

3
00:00:11,135 --> 00:00:15,557
So I hope you had a really good lunch, thanks again for attending this session, and I hope

4
00:00:15,577 --> 00:00:18,318
that you're enjoying this year's GDC and of course San Francisco.

5
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:23,661
So I'm here today to discuss how we devised and released the UX redesign for the live

6
00:00:23,841 --> 00:00:25,942
mobile game War Dragons last year.

7
00:00:26,917 --> 00:00:28,877
During this session, we'll cover the importance of

8
00:00:29,457 --> 00:00:32,739
creating a vision, establishing a clear design rationale,

9
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:37,480
community involvement, utilizing a phased rollout plan

10
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,081
for changes for a live product,

11
00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:42,962
and the testing methods used and how we remain data informed

12
00:00:43,242 --> 00:00:44,903
to insist in our key decisions.

13
00:00:45,543 --> 00:00:46,784
So hopefully this all sounds great.

14
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,124
Before I launch into that,

15
00:00:48,724 --> 00:00:50,525
here's a quick bio so that you know who I am.

16
00:00:51,513 --> 00:00:56,754
So I'm James and I work at Pocket Gems here in downtown SF as the director of UX.

17
00:00:57,595 --> 00:01:04,557
I joined the industry back in 2002 and I've been fortunate enough to work with some outstanding teams on some really awesome IP over the years.

18
00:01:05,177 --> 00:01:11,059
I've worked at companies that include EA, Disney, LucasArts, Rumble and of course Pocket Gems.

19
00:01:11,999 --> 00:01:15,941
So the current Pocket Gems stable of games includes War Dragons, that we're going to talk about,

20
00:01:16,362 --> 00:01:19,823
the award-winning episode, and the recently launched Wild Beyond.

21
00:01:19,843 --> 00:01:24,006
Now needless to say, that without the great team over there at Pocket Gems,

22
00:01:24,266 --> 00:01:25,427
this talk wouldn't be possible.

23
00:01:26,227 --> 00:01:29,769
So now you've got a little more context about myself, let's just get on with this talk.

24
00:01:31,447 --> 00:01:34,027
So War Dragons. War Dragons was launched in 2015.

25
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:41,289
It's a 3D real-time PvP title and has had 27 million and counting installs to date.

26
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:45,670
Now we're very fortunate to have a truly passionate player base in our games

27
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,030
that interact with each other on a daily basis.

28
00:01:48,831 --> 00:01:52,551
And just to illustrate how passionate the players are, here's some quick facts about them.

29
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:56,990
Typically players run over 20 battles per day on average.

30
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,891
That's roughly about a three minute battle.

31
00:01:59,631 --> 00:02:01,611
And 20% of players in the top leagues

32
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:03,652
have never missed a war battle

33
00:02:03,692 --> 00:02:06,353
for their entire time in the game.

34
00:02:07,153 --> 00:02:08,413
That's really quite incredible

35
00:02:08,453 --> 00:02:09,554
when you stop to think about it.

36
00:02:10,154 --> 00:02:12,295
We even have players that have married one another

37
00:02:12,315 --> 00:02:14,195
who met through the game's social features.

38
00:02:15,295 --> 00:02:16,716
So it was evident that we had a game

39
00:02:16,756 --> 00:02:18,336
that people played and clearly loved,

40
00:02:18,736 --> 00:02:20,777
and why did we want to redesign the UX?

41
00:02:22,429 --> 00:02:27,253
So we held stakeholder interviews and a common opinion that we heard was that the game was

42
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,896
inconsistent to navigate and in places complicated to understand.

43
00:02:31,896 --> 00:02:36,880
As I've explained, the game was created in 2015, which in mobile terms might as well

44
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,022
have been from a previous console generation.

45
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:45,867
Now there was a real desire to improve, simplify and standardize how our players could access

46
00:02:45,887 --> 00:02:46,688
the game content.

47
00:02:47,677 --> 00:02:50,498
As we observed, players interact with the product in person.

48
00:02:50,518 --> 00:02:52,979
It was like watching a game of digital table tennis,

49
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:55,060
as their hands just zipped across the phone,

50
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,382
accessing numerous buttons placed in varying positions

51
00:02:58,422 --> 00:02:59,542
to navigate the screens.

52
00:03:00,122 --> 00:03:02,383
It was tiring enough just to watch this happen,

53
00:03:02,743 --> 00:03:03,824
let alone have to do it.

54
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:10,028
Now with the addition of new features, the original screens and flows have become, well, muddled.

55
00:03:10,808 --> 00:03:14,611
Now if you've ever worked on a live mobile product that has run for a few years,

56
00:03:15,031 --> 00:03:17,793
then this scenario is likely going to sound familiar to you.

57
00:03:18,594 --> 00:03:21,976
Products evolve and systems that made complete sense at launch

58
00:03:22,417 --> 00:03:26,499
can lose their cohesion and effectiveness over time as new content gets added.

59
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,883
Now our testing confirmed that it was easy for new players to become disorientated.

60
00:03:32,223 --> 00:03:33,764
We wanted to help ease that burden.

61
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:40,621
Now via competitive research, we had identified common patterns in the most successful titles.

62
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:45,904
We realized that they shared consistent mobile design patterns, especially in regards to

63
00:03:45,944 --> 00:03:49,566
their navigation, and our product didn't do this in its current form.

64
00:03:51,017 --> 00:03:55,240
The older screens we had in the game were often inefficiently using screen space, which

65
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,681
in places resulted in barely legible content.

66
00:03:58,462 --> 00:04:02,885
There was an over-reliance on fixed-width stacking pop-ups and overlays that didn't

67
00:04:03,005 --> 00:04:04,887
utilize the full screen space available.

68
00:04:05,807 --> 00:04:09,130
So applying the principles established by Jacob Nielsen in Jacob's Law,

69
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:14,735
we aim to simplify the learning process for our users by providing familiar design patterns in

70
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:19,639
our suggested redesign. We believed that we could adopt and implement those proven

71
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:23,882
mobile design patterns into our game and significantly improve the UX as a whole.

72
00:04:25,664 --> 00:04:30,288
So we'd identified why we believed a redesign was worthwhile, and this allowed us to craft

73
00:04:30,328 --> 00:04:30,748
a vision.

74
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:34,591
This enabled the entire team to understand what we were hoping to achieve.

75
00:04:35,371 --> 00:04:37,833
We wanted to have more engaged players.

76
00:04:38,274 --> 00:04:41,336
We wanted improved accessibility to core content.

77
00:04:42,076 --> 00:04:45,119
We wanted structured and predictable navigation within the game.

78
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:48,441
We hoped we would find performance improvements too,

79
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:51,423
and definitely an upswing in early player retention,

80
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:55,606
and a familiar yet improved experience for existing players.

81
00:04:56,646 --> 00:04:58,768
This was a fairly compelling argument,

82
00:04:59,108 --> 00:05:01,089
and there was consensus by and across the team.

83
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,712
We felt that if we delivered upon all of those components,

84
00:05:05,112 --> 00:05:07,934
the product would be better, and the players would experience this,

85
00:05:08,314 --> 00:05:09,435
and therefore would accept it.

86
00:05:10,822 --> 00:05:11,802
But first, let's be clear.

87
00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:14,042
There was a definite risk involved with this.

88
00:05:14,963 --> 00:05:16,123
Because the product was live

89
00:05:16,243 --> 00:05:17,823
and had been in operation for some years

90
00:05:18,043 --> 00:05:19,424
and with a passionate player base,

91
00:05:19,804 --> 00:05:21,864
we were very cautious not to do something

92
00:05:21,884 --> 00:05:24,345
that would result in elder player angst

93
00:05:24,505 --> 00:05:25,565
and eventual churn.

94
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,726
We wanted to make sure that changes we planned

95
00:05:28,866 --> 00:05:30,887
made sense and were of value to the players.

96
00:05:31,327 --> 00:05:33,507
And that is why we targeted simple quality

97
00:05:33,587 --> 00:05:35,808
of life improvements alongside

98
00:05:36,108 --> 00:05:38,408
the underlying navigation restructuring work.

99
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:44,994
We equally wanted to make sure that we were not changing the best parts of the game, so as to lose our players.

100
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:49,397
Understanding our players was imperative, as we were about to change their game,

101
00:05:49,877 --> 00:05:54,781
so communication would be key, both internally and externally, in order for this to succeed.

102
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,902
First, we needed a plan.

103
00:05:58,383 --> 00:06:03,067
As this was a financially successful live mobile title, there was a lot at stake should we not succeed.

104
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:10,178
The nature of the changes we had planned made the logistics of delivering the redesign into our players' hands a real challenge.

105
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:15,703
The team had to balance continuing to support our existing players in the live product,

106
00:06:16,024 --> 00:06:19,447
whilst concurrently designing and building the redesign screens in the background.

107
00:06:20,728 --> 00:06:26,013
To best avoid player meltdown and a broken game, we decided upon utilizing a plan,

108
00:06:26,713 --> 00:06:30,797
which used the approaches of discover, explore, test, and listen to help.

109
00:06:31,906 --> 00:06:34,529
We identified key practices in each of these stages

110
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:36,791
and then devised a phased rollout plan

111
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:39,314
that would enable us to receive player feedback

112
00:06:39,354 --> 00:06:40,355
at regular intervals.

113
00:06:41,095 --> 00:06:43,578
If at any time it looked like we were in trouble,

114
00:06:43,878 --> 00:06:45,700
we have a collective understanding

115
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,083
that we would first try to address the issues,

116
00:06:48,443 --> 00:06:49,504
and if all else failed,

117
00:06:49,764 --> 00:06:52,307
we'd pull the plug on the redesign and focus elsewhere.

118
00:06:54,502 --> 00:06:56,604
So this slide introduces the phase rollout plan.

119
00:06:56,924 --> 00:06:59,547
And as you can see, the phases included concept,

120
00:06:59,947 --> 00:07:01,649
engineering phase one and phase two,

121
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,172
internal pocket gems and external testing,

122
00:07:04,912 --> 00:07:07,095
Android release, which was our iOS pilot,

123
00:07:07,235 --> 00:07:08,716
and then finally the worldwide release.

124
00:07:09,577 --> 00:07:14,323
Now the key idea of the rollout was to allow us to get feedback on the plan changes at

125
00:07:14,383 --> 00:07:19,569
multiple different stages of the development and to review it to catch any show-stopping

126
00:07:19,609 --> 00:07:19,970
issues.

127
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:26,498
Each phase of the timeline saw an intentional increase in the amount of users that we would

128
00:07:26,518 --> 00:07:27,439
receive feedback from.

129
00:07:29,264 --> 00:07:32,745
Now in the concept phase, this is when we began exploring and establishing the design

130
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:33,846
patterns for the redesign.

131
00:07:34,566 --> 00:07:39,287
We'd identified the existing product relied on an overuse of pop-ups, and our intention

132
00:07:39,307 --> 00:07:44,269
was to replace all of these with full-screen mobile design layouts and implement a standard

133
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:46,029
back button in the upper left of the screen.

134
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:51,871
The goals here being to address the issue of player disorientation we had seen in testing.

135
00:07:52,592 --> 00:07:57,873
Then to enable faster access to content, we restructured and collapsed the IA where it

136
00:07:57,913 --> 00:07:58,754
made the most sense.

137
00:07:59,554 --> 00:08:03,955
And to improve the ergonomic design of the navigation and make it more thumb-friendly,

138
00:08:04,396 --> 00:08:08,877
we replaced the old filing cabinets that had been positioned in the top center of the screen,

139
00:08:09,457 --> 00:08:14,139
and we implemented a new sub-navigation menu situated underneath the back button positioned

140
00:08:14,179 --> 00:08:15,039
at the side of the screen.

141
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:18,504
Considering the game was played and held in landscape,

142
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,927
we thought these changes aligned well

143
00:08:20,947 --> 00:08:23,249
with the underlying principles described in Fitts' Law.

144
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,473
We were making the navigation elements easily selectable

145
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:28,455
and positioning them close to our users.

146
00:08:29,355 --> 00:08:32,338
So, when we had a prototype that we felt was ready to share,

147
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,522
we sent this out as a password-protected prototype

148
00:08:35,622 --> 00:08:36,363
to the GPF.

149
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,971
And what is a GPF, I'm pretty sure you're all wondering.

150
00:08:40,652 --> 00:08:42,953
Well, this stands for Gameplay Faction.

151
00:08:43,513 --> 00:08:46,115
This is a group of our most highly engaged players.

152
00:08:47,095 --> 00:08:50,217
They are forum moderators and social media influencers

153
00:08:50,257 --> 00:08:52,578
and they have the ear of many a War Dragons player.

154
00:08:53,319 --> 00:08:55,780
And hearing their opinions was critically important to us

155
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,241
as we progressed with the redesign.

156
00:08:58,222 --> 00:09:00,383
So we gave them about a month to play around

157
00:09:00,423 --> 00:09:02,064
with the prototype and provide feedback.

158
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,662
As you can see from some of the quotes,

159
00:09:06,022 --> 00:09:08,003
the initial early feedback we received was positive.

160
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,664
They liked the prototype.

161
00:09:10,184 --> 00:09:12,425
Overall, it was considered an improved experience.

162
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:14,606
The key elements seemed to resonate well,

163
00:09:14,906 --> 00:09:17,007
and the redesign navigation appeared accepted.

164
00:09:17,727 --> 00:09:19,308
The prototype was serving its purpose

165
00:09:19,628 --> 00:09:20,929
and was allowing us to sound out

166
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:23,030
and gauge any resistance to the new designs.

167
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,692
Plus, we had provided our elder most engaged players

168
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,513
with full disclosure and super early visibility

169
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,334
on what the team had planned for the game.

170
00:09:32,998 --> 00:09:35,640
They could see that we hadn't created a new alien system.

171
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,041
The quality of life changes that we had implemented

172
00:09:38,081 --> 00:09:40,002
in the prototype were recognized and applauded.

173
00:09:40,022 --> 00:09:41,743
Now there's one thing to note,

174
00:09:42,324 --> 00:09:43,945
that when we sent out the prototype,

175
00:09:44,005 --> 00:09:45,906
we sent it out individually to the players.

176
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:47,647
They'd all signed NDAs,

177
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:49,849
so they couldn't discuss with anyone except ourselves.

178
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:52,690
So conversations at this stage were siloed.

179
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,752
And we found that this enabled us

180
00:09:55,032 --> 00:09:57,854
to elicit a good amount of feedback from them this way.

181
00:09:58,194 --> 00:10:01,316
And we ensured also that this kept conversations focused.

182
00:10:01,776 --> 00:10:03,620
That's so worth remembering for later on.

183
00:10:04,482 --> 00:10:07,369
At the end of this time, we collated their comments and reviewed,

184
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,697
and it seemed we were hitting the right chords with the most dedicated players.

185
00:10:12,702 --> 00:10:16,924
As we just discovered, there were no hard no's at this point, and we deemed it safe

186
00:10:16,964 --> 00:10:21,506
to move from the concept phase to the first engineering phase, and actually begin implementation.

187
00:10:22,366 --> 00:10:26,048
Now the prototype felt good to both ourselves and the GPF players.

188
00:10:26,828 --> 00:10:30,590
It's always easier to get a better read when designs are playable on the intended target

189
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:31,890
device in a user's hands, right?

190
00:10:32,551 --> 00:10:36,772
So we were iterating upon the screens as we received feedback, but at this point, that

191
00:10:36,812 --> 00:10:39,974
had only really included some suggestions and minor tweaks here and there.

192
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:42,779
Certainly there were no major objections

193
00:10:42,819 --> 00:10:45,645
that should derail us from forging ahead.

194
00:10:47,169 --> 00:10:48,532
Now we began to concentrate upon

195
00:10:48,572 --> 00:10:50,857
implementing our core gameplay loops.

196
00:10:52,162 --> 00:10:53,962
These were the screens most touched by players

197
00:10:54,142 --> 00:10:56,563
and included the management and the training of their dragons,

198
00:10:57,043 --> 00:10:59,224
how to initiate attacks upon other players.

199
00:10:59,904 --> 00:11:03,026
Tackling these screens kind of made a whole bunch of sense to us.

200
00:11:03,706 --> 00:11:07,407
We also didn't have a large amount of engineering resources

201
00:11:07,447 --> 00:11:08,668
available to us at this point,

202
00:11:09,228 --> 00:11:11,749
so we used this, the first engineering phase,

203
00:11:11,869 --> 00:11:15,630
as a yardstick to gauge how long screens using the redesign,

204
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,511
the further screens would take to implement.

205
00:11:18,528 --> 00:11:22,572
We definitely didn't want to overburden the engineering resources that we had available

206
00:11:22,812 --> 00:11:24,974
with a million and one changes right from the get-go.

207
00:11:25,895 --> 00:11:30,179
So consulting with the engineering team as to what was achievable in Q1, this helped

208
00:11:30,219 --> 00:11:32,361
define and focus the early redesign work.

209
00:11:33,382 --> 00:11:37,926
The backbone of the redesign components was really established within these core screens.

210
00:11:38,818 --> 00:11:42,223
The thinking being that once we had refactored the menus for these screens,

211
00:11:42,643 --> 00:11:48,031
it would be an awful lot easier and faster to implement and share assets and modules across others.

212
00:11:48,852 --> 00:11:50,895
And here was our consistent navigation screen,

213
00:11:51,296 --> 00:11:54,721
sub-navigation and full screen content mode beginning to take shape.

214
00:11:56,506 --> 00:12:00,189
As we moved into Q2 for 2018, the core screens were completed.

215
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:04,471
The engineering effort shifted to the other first-level navigation screens

216
00:12:04,592 --> 00:12:05,952
and the events screens.

217
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:10,095
Understandably, we wanted to make sure that we were using our time effectively.

218
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:13,598
And our engineers identified ways to bring marked improvement

219
00:12:13,618 --> 00:12:15,839
to the formants of the game's UI screens

220
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:17,420
in relation to their code structure.

221
00:12:18,241 --> 00:12:21,003
We were testing internally and all roads pointed to a good place.

222
00:12:22,751 --> 00:12:24,752
So as we tackled those other key menu screens,

223
00:12:24,792 --> 00:12:26,253
the team was really gathering momentum.

224
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:29,696
Our dragon rider screens were now far more accessible

225
00:12:30,056 --> 00:12:31,777
as we'd surface their access points

226
00:12:31,797 --> 00:12:34,659
to the top level of our HUD by reworking the IA.

227
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,641
In addition, we positioned the rider models

228
00:12:38,062 --> 00:12:40,563
front and center in a much more prominent manner

229
00:12:41,144 --> 00:12:44,026
so players could now clearly enjoy their aesthetic designs.

230
00:12:45,027 --> 00:12:47,188
In-house guerrilla testing of the latest builds

231
00:12:47,488 --> 00:12:49,730
seemed to confirm that these changes were well received.

232
00:12:50,678 --> 00:12:52,738
We also began to update the chat screens,

233
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:56,059
making sure that they adhere to the new navigation design

234
00:12:56,099 --> 00:12:56,799
principles too.

235
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,840
Now, as the engineering phase two continued,

236
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,761
we were allocated just a few additional resources.

237
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:07,242
So we took to addressing one of the key collection of screens

238
00:13:07,402 --> 00:13:10,322
accessed in-game, that being the event system.

239
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:14,263
So this aspect of the game features time-based events

240
00:13:14,323 --> 00:13:16,904
that players really got into with the aim of being

241
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:19,265
able to win new dragons and other awesome prizes.

242
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:23,639
Now, our events are a key revenue driver for War Dragons,

243
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,641
and each event runs for a time period of three months.

244
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:30,523
Now, when we ran design reviews and heuristic evaluation

245
00:13:30,563 --> 00:13:32,564
for the old design, we observed that it

246
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:35,106
was designed using non-mobile-friendly patterns,

247
00:13:35,366 --> 00:13:36,386
as you can see in the slide.

248
00:13:37,145 --> 00:13:39,767
We identified that it was plagued by discoverability,

249
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:42,569
sequential content, and accessibility issues.

250
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:45,070
And it was extremely easy to lose track

251
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:47,452
of which branch of rewards a player was in

252
00:13:47,852 --> 00:13:49,373
whilst navigating through the content

253
00:13:49,393 --> 00:13:51,194
due to poor formatting.

254
00:13:52,755 --> 00:13:54,877
So first we applied the core navigation structure

255
00:13:55,137 --> 00:13:57,138
that we had deployed elsewhere to these screens.

256
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:58,939
Then we took a step back

257
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,341
and reviewed our earlier competitor analysis

258
00:14:01,701 --> 00:14:03,002
and again leveraged this

259
00:14:03,062 --> 00:14:04,783
to help us reach our design solution.

260
00:14:05,765 --> 00:14:08,887
Removed were the undersized and awkward to navigate windows

261
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:12,329
previously used to display multiple content branches.

262
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:15,611
And we instead messaged this via a carousel.

263
00:14:16,472 --> 00:14:19,033
Now we took care to limit the number of elements

264
00:14:19,073 --> 00:14:20,134
for use in the carousel,

265
00:14:20,554 --> 00:14:22,676
so as not to create unnecessary scrolling

266
00:14:22,816 --> 00:14:25,237
and to avoid causing player interaction fatigue.

267
00:14:26,518 --> 00:14:28,799
And we addressed discoverability issues

268
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:30,540
via the illusion of continuity,

269
00:14:30,941 --> 00:14:33,802
half images, color cues, and information sent.

270
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:40,181
We use large phone-friendly panels with clear imagery depicting which prizes were available,

271
00:14:40,682 --> 00:14:42,702
all aimed at driving player engagement time.

272
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:48,424
And in here, we injected personality and visual interest to the top of the panels of each branch

273
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,365
by using branded imagery.

274
00:14:51,797 --> 00:14:55,059
Content that was once spread across 18 screens

275
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:58,100
could instead now be viewed and accessed in just two.

276
00:14:59,201 --> 00:15:01,162
Plus, we created the icons for the branches

277
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,163
at an increased size for far easier interaction than before.

278
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:08,445
To reduce further clutter, we displayed details

279
00:15:08,485 --> 00:15:10,426
and information for the individual prices

280
00:15:10,906 --> 00:15:12,027
placed in a small pop-up,

281
00:15:12,147 --> 00:15:14,088
which was dismissible via a close button.

282
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:17,129
This set of screens alone elicited

283
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:18,810
some of the most positive responses

284
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,191
that we'd had from on-site testing.

285
00:15:22,007 --> 00:15:25,691
Okay, so now it was time to get the build back into our players' hands again.

286
00:15:26,172 --> 00:15:30,557
We were really eager to hear their thoughts, having received such encouragement previously.

287
00:15:30,977 --> 00:15:35,042
So we excitedly began the fourth phase, and this featured some heavy amounts of testing.

288
00:15:37,252 --> 00:15:39,053
So we ran on-site A-B testing,

289
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,433
during which we gave testers the old

290
00:15:41,533 --> 00:15:43,474
and the new versions of the game to interact with.

291
00:15:44,294 --> 00:15:45,854
These testers were mobile gamers,

292
00:15:46,194 --> 00:15:47,795
but they hadn't yet played War Dragons.

293
00:15:48,635 --> 00:15:52,076
So the results unanimously pointed towards the new design

294
00:15:52,136 --> 00:15:53,496
being preferred by the testers.

295
00:15:54,016 --> 00:15:55,217
We were hearing comments like,

296
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:56,697
well, this just feels more modern

297
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:58,298
and better suited for a phone.

298
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,638
And this is just easier to understand.

299
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:01,798
This was awesome.

300
00:16:02,939 --> 00:16:05,301
We'd also been running system usability tests

301
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:06,561
during the on-site testing,

302
00:16:06,881 --> 00:16:08,402
which resulted in solid scores,

303
00:16:08,803 --> 00:16:10,224
and it was clear that what we had done

304
00:16:10,444 --> 00:16:11,604
wasn't breaking the game.

305
00:16:12,865 --> 00:16:15,427
As a further means of informing and preparing

306
00:16:15,487 --> 00:16:17,628
the community for the incoming changes,

307
00:16:18,088 --> 00:16:20,109
we presented the screens via a live demo

308
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,210
on our Facebook stream.

309
00:16:21,871 --> 00:16:22,651
So far, so good.

310
00:16:23,131 --> 00:16:24,332
I mean, what could stop us now?

311
00:16:25,012 --> 00:16:26,373
Clearly, we're in the home stretch, right?

312
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:28,394
Actually, no.

313
00:16:29,807 --> 00:16:33,470
Although they had liked it initially in the wireframe and prototype phase,

314
00:16:33,971 --> 00:16:37,073
when we gave them access to this new restricted build,

315
00:16:37,493 --> 00:16:39,095
now the elder players didn't approve.

316
00:16:39,655 --> 00:16:41,957
This is by far the most difficult phase to get through.

317
00:16:43,358 --> 00:16:48,022
We clearly reminded the players they'd all participated in the feedback loop months earlier.

318
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:56,083
We wanted them to understand that our changes were targeted at both new and old players alike,

319
00:16:56,643 --> 00:17:00,705
and we wanted them to help us understand exactly what it was that they now disliked.

320
00:17:01,485 --> 00:17:07,228
First, we just really wanted them to calm down. The key thing here was that we wanted the community

321
00:17:07,248 --> 00:17:12,310
to see and understand that we were truly listening and valuing their input. Just to illustrate the

322
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:17,131
level of disdain that we witnessed in the comments we received, well, here it is on the next slide.

323
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:24,032
So this was really worrying to us as the players were hugely invested in the game.

324
00:17:24,932 --> 00:17:28,313
And most had been playing it since it had first come out in 2015.

325
00:17:28,794 --> 00:17:33,355
And here they were, rejecting the designs in high fidelity, now that they had it in their hands.

326
00:17:33,895 --> 00:17:35,716
Here they were, rejecting the buttons.

327
00:17:36,016 --> 00:17:38,117
Here they were, rejecting the layout changes.

328
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:40,778
Here they were, rejecting full screen content mode,

329
00:17:41,078 --> 00:17:45,079
and in places the change from horizontal to vertical roster selection.

330
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,682
As you can see from the quotes, some of the other elder players were threatening to quit if we released it.

331
00:17:51,322 --> 00:17:54,824
This was exactly what we had wanted to avoid at all costs.

332
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:58,465
Our elder players walking away due to the plan changes.

333
00:17:59,126 --> 00:18:02,547
It was tough reading and it certainly had the potential to become a dark time.

334
00:18:03,828 --> 00:18:06,789
Not quite this dark, but you know, you get the picture.

335
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,271
But the rejection was really worrying.

336
00:18:10,999 --> 00:18:13,181
Were we really going to have to drop the redesign

337
00:18:13,221 --> 00:18:14,862
after so much work and effort?

338
00:18:15,502 --> 00:18:16,583
Well, no, not so fast.

339
00:18:17,084 --> 00:18:19,726
We clearly had to evaluate the feedback we were receiving.

340
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,748
If you remember, I explained earlier

341
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,569
that during the initial prototype testing,

342
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:27,471
this had been carried out in siloed discussions

343
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:28,852
with individual players.

344
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,014
Now, the elder players were testing the new build

345
00:18:32,054 --> 00:18:32,575
as a group.

346
00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:35,917
And as such, this enabled close forum discussions

347
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:37,859
to take place between themselves.

348
00:18:38,738 --> 00:18:40,899
This yielded very different results.

349
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:41,940
Very different.

350
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,741
Having the product in their hands with these new designs

351
00:18:44,781 --> 00:18:46,361
was suddenly perhaps too real for some.

352
00:18:47,361 --> 00:18:48,862
Now we wondered if we were having to deal

353
00:18:48,882 --> 00:18:51,523
with a pack mentality, and the trick here

354
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:54,624
was trying to decipher what might be subjective

355
00:18:54,844 --> 00:18:56,545
as opposed to objective feedback

356
00:18:56,745 --> 00:18:58,385
that we could use to improve the product.

357
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:00,986
I mean, there's absolutely no point in testing

358
00:19:01,246 --> 00:19:03,067
if you don't listen and act upon the feedback, right?

359
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:08,058
Well, there was a lot of back and forth, and we intentionally gave them time to adapt to

360
00:19:08,098 --> 00:19:08,619
the design.

361
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:14,460
One of our awesome product managers, thank you Justin, was involved in direct communication

362
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:20,002
by the Close Forum group, and he spent a vast amount of time repeatedly explaining why we

363
00:19:20,042 --> 00:19:24,103
had made the choices that we did, and backed it up with examples and research.

364
00:19:25,104 --> 00:19:29,913
Now, while some of the players began to soften their dislike through time using the build,

365
00:19:30,374 --> 00:19:35,023
others continually threatened to rage-quit the game if we persisted with the launch of the redesign.

366
00:19:36,303 --> 00:19:38,145
I mean, of course we really were listing.

367
00:19:38,165 --> 00:19:39,565
It wasn't just lip service.

368
00:19:40,326 --> 00:19:44,288
The switch from a horizontal to a vertical roster selection

369
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:47,050
to the time-sensitive pre-attack screen

370
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,291
was a consistent source for complaints

371
00:19:49,611 --> 00:19:50,652
from our elder players.

372
00:19:50,672 --> 00:19:53,193
And that seemed to be the one main change

373
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,274
that they absolutely refused to entertain.

374
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,378
They were explaining that as a horizontal selection,

375
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:02,241
it was easier to scan and pass the roster information quickly,

376
00:20:02,582 --> 00:20:05,505
which is exactly what they had to do on this particular screen,

377
00:20:06,046 --> 00:20:08,388
and that now they were incorrectly selecting dragons

378
00:20:08,448 --> 00:20:09,569
in the new vertical scheme.

379
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,833
So we listened, evaluated their feedback,

380
00:20:13,153 --> 00:20:15,396
and actually in recognition, we reverted this.

381
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:20,561
This was a crucial moment as the players could now see that we were not ignoring them.

382
00:20:21,341 --> 00:20:26,444
We also switched the matchmaking base selection over from the right to left after hearing

383
00:20:26,524 --> 00:20:28,305
lots of opposition to the initial design.

384
00:20:28,965 --> 00:20:33,968
This particular complaint seemed to be more about change resistance as it had been previously

385
00:20:34,008 --> 00:20:34,968
located on the left.

386
00:20:35,328 --> 00:20:38,910
However, once again we accommodated these requests in a further iteration.

387
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:43,852
Now, as we evaluated the other requests, and there were a lot, that they were making,

388
00:20:43,912 --> 00:20:48,394
we had to balance this against development time and ask ourselves if we truly believed

389
00:20:48,595 --> 00:20:53,797
that these were game-breaking issues for the other players at large, or perhaps a set of personal dislikes.

390
00:20:55,052 --> 00:20:57,593
Once again, our phased release plan came into play.

391
00:20:58,293 --> 00:21:00,954
Now, although there were some emotionally fueled points

392
00:21:01,014 --> 00:21:02,675
being argued by the elder players,

393
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:06,037
we had to consider that the previous internal testing

394
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:09,258
had gone well, the on-site A-B testing and S-U-S scores

395
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:12,060
all pointed to a more usable and improved product.

396
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,321
We'd done our homework and based everything

397
00:21:14,361 --> 00:21:16,602
on best practices and established design patterns.

398
00:21:17,302 --> 00:21:19,944
Our research had led us to these solutions.

399
00:21:20,584 --> 00:21:22,446
So was this just a storm in a teacup,

400
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,547
and should we abandon the whole redesign now?

401
00:21:25,307 --> 00:21:28,810
Well, we still unanimously believed as a team

402
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,772
in the steps we had taken to measure our changes,

403
00:21:32,252 --> 00:21:33,953
so we decided to release to Android

404
00:21:33,973 --> 00:21:34,994
and get more data points.

405
00:21:36,555 --> 00:21:39,216
So let's remind ourselves that this was positioned

406
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,458
as our Android test and iOS pilot

407
00:21:41,698 --> 00:21:43,059
prior to releasing worldwide.

408
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:45,681
This was an important gate that we had to pass through.

409
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:48,674
Now once it was released to the Android community,

410
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:51,215
we observed the anticipated change resistance

411
00:21:51,235 --> 00:21:52,155
that we had expected.

412
00:21:52,575 --> 00:21:53,815
But the key thing to note here

413
00:21:54,175 --> 00:21:56,896
is that the actual level of resistance was far less

414
00:21:57,176 --> 00:21:58,857
than we had been preparing ourselves for.

415
00:21:59,697 --> 00:22:03,258
The much feared wash of total rejection, it didn't appear.

416
00:22:03,998 --> 00:22:05,818
Actually, anything but that.

417
00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:07,899
Sure, there were folks that didn't like it,

418
00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:10,060
but it didn't mirror the level of rejection

419
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,440
we had just been going through from the elder players.

420
00:22:13,338 --> 00:22:15,486
And before we knew it, a few days had passed.

421
00:22:15,888 --> 00:22:19,221
The forums had reacted, and then moved on to another topic to debate.

422
00:22:21,344 --> 00:22:27,949
So there was still an air of anxiety due to the level of emotion and the elder player feedback we'd received.

423
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:32,853
And although the Android release feedback contained some negativity towards the changes,

424
00:22:33,314 --> 00:22:37,577
we were still seeing our players continuing to engage with the game using the new designs.

425
00:22:37,977 --> 00:22:41,300
But why wasn't everyone rage quitting, as had been forewarned?

426
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,022
And then it started getting super interesting.

427
00:22:44,562 --> 00:22:46,164
We switched on the in-game surveys.

428
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:51,400
Then we started to receive those results, and we began to eagerly review them to find

429
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,264
out what a mass volume of players thought of the work we had done.

430
00:22:56,076 --> 00:22:57,817
Talk about a feel-good factor.

431
00:22:58,677 --> 00:22:59,518
They weren't quitting.

432
00:22:59,918 --> 00:23:02,900
They were telling us they actually appreciated the change that we had made.

433
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,181
Respondents were in their thousands.

434
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:09,343
They were overwhelmingly telling us that they liked the feel of the new design.

435
00:23:09,823 --> 00:23:12,285
They told us they believed it was better than the previous one.

436
00:23:13,005 --> 00:23:17,968
They were here confirming that access to otherwise buried content had now been surfaced and made

437
00:23:18,028 --> 00:23:18,768
easier to get to.

438
00:23:19,349 --> 00:23:21,530
Suddenly, the positive news was flowing again.

439
00:23:22,131 --> 00:23:28,315
Here we had hard quantitative data from our Android community.

440
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:32,619
The survey results filled the team with confidence, and as we assessed the proportion of users

441
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:34,881
that were encountering the problems with the new design.

442
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,663
If I could stay on this slide all day, I would.

443
00:23:40,207 --> 00:23:43,270
Okay, so the anxiety we'd experienced previously was becoming just a memory.

444
00:23:43,771 --> 00:23:48,175
We still had work ahead of us, but we had the really hard data from our community to

445
00:23:48,195 --> 00:23:52,419
back us up, and it was such a key turning point, and the team was grateful that we had

446
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:56,563
held firm in our belief that we needed more data from a wider number of players.

447
00:23:57,484 --> 00:24:02,088
We relayed the findings back to the elder players, and it was really pleasing to see

448
00:24:02,128 --> 00:24:03,970
that on the whole, they accepted this.

449
00:24:04,831 --> 00:24:07,735
We gave them full disclosure into the questions we had asked

450
00:24:08,096 --> 00:24:10,118
and the level range of players that we had asked these to.

451
00:24:11,921 --> 00:24:13,723
As we approached the full worldwide release,

452
00:24:13,944 --> 00:24:15,566
we tackled some last remaining issues.

453
00:24:16,126 --> 00:24:19,251
We were really aware that loading times for certain sections were far too long,

454
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:21,914
so we targeted this as an area to improve.

455
00:24:22,887 --> 00:24:25,450
Additionally, we refreshed the prizes and ranked screens

456
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:28,093
with a new visual direction and continued the rollout

457
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,434
of the sidebar navigation.

458
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:31,697
The community reaction to these changes

459
00:24:31,717 --> 00:24:32,958
was unanimously positive,

460
00:24:33,399 --> 00:24:35,401
even the key elder players got on board with this.

461
00:24:37,023 --> 00:24:39,586
So, then it was time to finally let it run in the wild.

462
00:24:40,366 --> 00:24:40,927
We'd done that.

463
00:24:42,855 --> 00:24:44,956
We are, of course, a free-to-play game.

464
00:24:45,297 --> 00:24:46,678
That means that we aim to do things

465
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:48,159
that can help improve our metrics

466
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:49,560
from a business perspective.

467
00:24:50,361 --> 00:24:52,883
Well, the improvements we saw in our metrics were fantastic.

468
00:24:53,443 --> 00:24:56,466
There was a 30% increase in player time spent in the game.

469
00:24:56,946 --> 00:24:59,468
There was a 27% art DAO increase.

470
00:24:59,868 --> 00:25:02,551
There was a 10% early player retention increase.

471
00:25:03,231 --> 00:25:05,513
Frame rate also improved significantly,

472
00:25:05,793 --> 00:25:07,335
which is kudos to our engineers.

473
00:25:07,595 --> 00:25:09,776
They've done an awesome job refactoring the screens.

474
00:25:10,357 --> 00:25:11,198
Reasons to celebrate.

475
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,430
So are we finished?

476
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:16,411
Well, today there is still a dedicated

477
00:25:16,471 --> 00:25:17,931
and active worldwide community,

478
00:25:18,211 --> 00:25:19,852
who, including those elder players,

479
00:25:19,992 --> 00:25:21,292
that are still playing War Dragons.

480
00:25:22,292 --> 00:25:24,033
The team continues to bring improvements

481
00:25:24,053 --> 00:25:26,374
to the existing features on a regular basis

482
00:25:26,774 --> 00:25:29,094
as we listen and refine and help where we can.

483
00:25:30,135 --> 00:25:32,375
It's certainly true that a game evolves over time,

484
00:25:32,675 --> 00:25:34,356
and so do the players and their needs.

485
00:25:35,216 --> 00:25:36,276
And we definitely have a belief

486
00:25:36,777 --> 00:25:38,457
that it's a marathon, not a sprint,

487
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:40,838
that mentality for supporting a live product.

488
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,748
So learnings, well, establishing and defining

489
00:25:45,848 --> 00:25:47,188
a product vision is essential.

490
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:52,131
Researching and identifying the design patterns to use

491
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:55,553
made achieving team alignment an awful lot easier

492
00:25:55,593 --> 00:25:57,494
and helped focus our workload.

493
00:25:58,874 --> 00:26:00,635
A stage rollout enabled the team

494
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:02,516
to constantly receive validation,

495
00:26:02,876 --> 00:26:04,437
be that from the prototype stage

496
00:26:04,497 --> 00:26:05,798
to the full worldwide release.

497
00:26:06,378 --> 00:26:09,340
It was a plan that allowed us to execute with no issues.

498
00:26:11,151 --> 00:26:13,412
Involve the community as much as you can

499
00:26:13,612 --> 00:26:17,853
and do exercise sound judgment in evaluating their feedback.

500
00:26:18,373 --> 00:26:19,633
Get to understand your players

501
00:26:19,894 --> 00:26:21,594
and bring them along with you on the ride.

502
00:26:23,895 --> 00:26:25,815
Iterate and use a test tirelessly.

503
00:26:26,295 --> 00:26:29,296
Utilize both qualitative and quantitative data

504
00:26:29,616 --> 00:26:31,257
alongside all of the aforementioned

505
00:26:31,597 --> 00:26:33,738
to assist you in your decision-making process.

506
00:26:34,538 --> 00:26:36,659
And perhaps the most critical one for me,

507
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:38,319
believe in your team.

508
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:40,340
Thank you.

509
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:50,092
I think we've got time for any questions if anybody wants.

510
00:26:53,595 --> 00:26:54,176
The microphones?

511
00:26:56,398 --> 00:26:56,499
Hi.

512
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:57,219
How's it going?

513
00:26:57,239 --> 00:27:01,344
Can you talk about how lifetime value of those elder players contributed to your decisions

514
00:27:01,404 --> 00:27:03,206
about what you would and wouldn't accept?

515
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:07,250
I have no idea what they actually were contributing, but if you found that really they're bringing in all the money,

516
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:08,451
ultimately would you have...

517
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:12,309
completely scrapped the entire design at the end of the day.

518
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:15,892
They definitely were influencing our revenue, yes.

519
00:27:16,233 --> 00:27:18,895
You know, they did get on board, like I say.

520
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:21,917
It was an extremely delicate balancing act that we had to do.

521
00:27:21,937 --> 00:27:25,120
So, you know, that's why we consulted them first and foremost.

522
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:29,844
The GPF, the Elder Players, there was around 10 to 15 people right at the beginning.

523
00:27:30,264 --> 00:27:34,207
And because they are so, so, so ingrained in the Dragons community,

524
00:27:34,548 --> 00:27:37,950
we felt that that was just like a really solid place to go and consult with.

525
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:38,511
So, yeah.

526
00:27:38,971 --> 00:27:41,872
I mean, it was a happy story, right?

527
00:27:41,892 --> 00:27:42,772
Yeah.

528
00:27:42,852 --> 00:27:45,592
Hi.

529
00:27:46,052 --> 00:27:51,514
You spoke a little bit about how the community received your game changes differently compared

530
00:27:51,534 --> 00:27:55,414
to when they were shown in wireframes and prototypes and then when they were shown

531
00:27:55,454 --> 00:27:55,895
as a group.

532
00:27:55,935 --> 00:27:58,675
Could you explain a little bit more about why you believe that differed?

533
00:27:58,715 --> 00:28:04,776
Is it because of the group mentality and maybe they had friends who were affecting their

534
00:28:04,796 --> 00:28:05,416
opinion or?

535
00:28:05,437 --> 00:28:05,517
Yeah.

536
00:28:05,937 --> 00:28:12,361
You mean, do I have a hypothesis as to why it was so different when they received it?

537
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:20,787
Yeah, I mean, just the fact that they were siloed conversations to begin with meant that they weren't sharing and discussing with anybody else there.

538
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:23,348
And it did just keep it completely focused.

539
00:28:23,849 --> 00:28:28,671
Yeah, and then just the very fact that, you know, they were all together as a group.

540
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:33,173
I don't know if it's just this natural reaction of one person saying, well, I don't really like

541
00:28:33,193 --> 00:28:36,995
this anymore, and other people jumping onto that, you know, onto that particular argument.

542
00:28:37,295 --> 00:28:38,896
That was what we saw. Okay, thank you.

543
00:28:42,928 --> 00:28:49,775
So you had metrics up there that showed an uplift in your ARPDAU and your engagement,

544
00:28:50,536 --> 00:28:56,221
but you're still supporting a live game. So how did you tie those metrics directly to the redesign?

545
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:00,629
Well, that's part of the vision that we established at the beginning.

546
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:03,530
Yeah, we definitely were trying to look at increased frame rate

547
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,611
through refactoring of our code.

548
00:29:06,531 --> 00:29:09,492
We knew that it was a disorientation issue

549
00:29:09,632 --> 00:29:11,992
that we'd witnessed in testing with new players.

550
00:29:12,552 --> 00:29:15,653
So we felt strongly that by redoing the navigation

551
00:29:15,673 --> 00:29:18,254
that we would actually improve early player attention,

552
00:29:18,294 --> 00:29:19,434
which is exactly what we saw.

553
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:22,115
Yeah.

554
00:29:22,355 --> 00:29:24,035
And then what was the last one? I can't remember now.

555
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:26,256
Sorry, my brain has blanked on me.

556
00:29:27,997 --> 00:29:28,497
Up, down, yeah.

557
00:29:29,938 --> 00:29:31,779
I think we got lucky there, more than anything.

558
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:33,941
You know? I mean, the fact that players

559
00:29:34,061 --> 00:29:35,682
stayed in the game more time

560
00:29:36,102 --> 00:29:38,003
now, you know, like a 30% increase

561
00:29:38,043 --> 00:29:39,945
of actual time spent in the game,

562
00:29:40,705 --> 00:29:41,926
there's 30% more time

563
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,347
for them to actually spend something, yeah?

564
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:46,109
Does that make sense?

565
00:29:48,551 --> 00:29:48,671
Okay.

566
00:29:50,712 --> 00:29:50,852
Hello.

567
00:29:51,512 --> 00:29:58,474
Hello. I'm just wondering, do you think it would have relieved some of the anxiety of

568
00:29:58,554 --> 00:30:06,997
rejection from the larger community if you had, even though like the elder players, like

569
00:30:07,057 --> 00:30:12,078
their opinions are definitely like very important because they know what they want from the

570
00:30:12,118 --> 00:30:17,440
game, but if you had also involved like maybe a group of slightly newer players?

571
00:30:18,325 --> 00:30:20,767
Sure. Well, I mean, we did do this.

572
00:30:20,927 --> 00:30:23,109
You know, you can see through the stages that we had.

573
00:30:23,149 --> 00:30:26,372
You know, we brought people on site who were new to get their feedback.

574
00:30:26,652 --> 00:30:29,534
That was all evaluated there from the on-site testing.

575
00:30:29,834 --> 00:30:33,137
You know, and then obviously sharing it via the Facebook live stream as well.

576
00:30:33,537 --> 00:30:34,938
That was for everybody to see, right?

577
00:30:35,018 --> 00:30:36,239
It wasn't just the elder players.

578
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,662
So we did try to make sure that the community had visibility.

579
00:30:40,102 --> 00:30:43,845
But it was key for us, as I say, just to get that elder player buy-in

580
00:30:44,106 --> 00:30:46,628
because they were like basically social media influencers.

581
00:30:47,188 --> 00:30:50,593
influences for dragons, yeah? Okay. Thank you.

582
00:30:50,613 --> 00:30:56,881
Okay, quick question. You had mentioned at some point that you use navigation principles

583
00:30:56,941 --> 00:31:01,508
when designing. Just wanted you to go over what navigation principles you mean by that.

584
00:31:03,112 --> 00:31:10,318
Well, we used our competitive research to see what other successful mobile design patterns we saw.

585
00:31:10,678 --> 00:31:16,523
And the one thing that we saw that was a really repeating motif was the consistent navigation,

586
00:31:16,563 --> 00:31:20,746
the back button, the sub-navigation where things are in your ergonomic thumb range.

587
00:31:21,447 --> 00:31:29,613
Because the game had been created in 2015 and it really wasn't built with solid mobile design principles in practice.

588
00:31:29,633 --> 00:31:30,554
And that's what we tried to do.

589
00:31:32,948 --> 00:31:34,035
I think that's all we've got time for.

590
00:31:34,779 --> 00:31:35,081
Thank you.
