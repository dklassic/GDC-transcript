00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:14,589
This is Finding Your Voice on TikTok.

2
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:17,790
Hello, everyone.

3
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:19,431
My name is Grace Curtis.

4
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:28,895
I am the PR and Community Manager at Future Friends Games, which is a publishing and promotion hybrid company based in the United Kingdom.

5
00:00:31,262 --> 00:00:44,171
In terms of why the hell I'm even qualified to be talking about this, with my time at Future Friends, I've had the opportunity to work and help grow a great number of really interesting, fantastic TikTok accounts.

6
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:49,334
So in terms of the publishing side of the company, I helped work on games like X01, Omno,

7
00:00:50,982 --> 00:00:52,563
and through our many wonderful clients.

8
00:00:53,283 --> 00:00:58,986
It was Clone Drone in the Danger Zone, Vampire Survivors, Hype Train, Heavenly Bodies, yada yada yada.

9
00:00:59,906 --> 00:01:03,748
And as you can see, the numbers we were able to achieve were pretty good across the board.

10
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:05,649
Over 150,000 followers for X01, over 200,000 for Omino.

11
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,350
of

12
00:01:22,312 --> 00:01:28,034
And we were able to achieve this without spending a single penny on ads or promotion within TikTok.

13
00:01:28,074 --> 00:01:29,495
We did all of this organically.

14
00:01:29,955 --> 00:01:32,596
And furthermore, we kind of had to do it in our spare time.

15
00:01:32,876 --> 00:01:35,157
We're a really small company and we have a lot of stuff to do.

16
00:01:35,898 --> 00:01:41,680
And so this was all kind of achieved on a shoestring budget, both in terms of money and time.

17
00:01:43,386 --> 00:01:46,368
For a more recent example of a TikTok that did really, really well.

18
00:01:46,508 --> 00:01:49,831
So this is from our upcoming game Europa, which is hopefully going to be out this year.

19
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:51,572
See if it wants to play.

20
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,484
Lovely.

21
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:11,607
And that got 900,000 views last time I checked.

22
00:02:12,127 --> 00:02:13,488
So, still got it.

23
00:02:15,749 --> 00:02:16,610
TikTok, right.

24
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,251
I'm sure you've heard of it.

25
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:23,534
If you haven't, congratulations on bravely walking into this room not knowing what you're about to see.

26
00:02:24,195 --> 00:02:28,277
It is a video sharing platform and it's a pretty big deal.

27
00:02:29,018 --> 00:02:31,920
Last year, 2022, it was the most downloaded app

28
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,061
in the world.

29
00:02:33,401 --> 00:02:39,686
It's got about a billion monthly users, and the people who are on TikTok are mostly very young and digitally literate.

30
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:51,795
A recent report by the New York Times found that about 40% of people who are in the Generation Z, so that's me, the Zoomers, are using apps like TikTok and Instagram instead of Google.

31
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:56,938
So they're hustling in on Google's territory, which is how you know this is a big deal.

32
00:03:00,603 --> 00:03:04,105
Zuma stocks, there you go.

33
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:09,568
The thing that makes TikTok special is the thing that most people really struggle to understand about it, which is a for you page.

34
00:03:10,188 --> 00:03:17,132
Rather than showing you content by people you follow, when you open up TikTok, what you get is a stream of seemingly random videos.

35
00:03:18,105 --> 00:03:28,351
But the more time you spend on the app, as you interact with those videos, liking, commenting, or swiping on past, the TikTok algorithm will monitor that information and use it to further curate your feed.

36
00:03:28,831 --> 00:03:31,753
So the more time you spend on TikTok, the better the platform becomes.

37
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:36,955
This is how we were able to achieve those really big organic numbers that I told you about before.

38
00:03:37,256 --> 00:03:38,997
It was by getting on people's For You pages.

39
00:03:39,397 --> 00:03:41,138
And that's kind of what I'm going to talk about today.

40
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:46,741
How to do that in a way that isn't shady, embarrassing, cringe, or just difficult.

41
00:03:48,881 --> 00:03:49,821
About those numbers, right.

42
00:03:50,182 --> 00:03:56,604
I obviously shouldn't have to explain to you the benefit of having 9 million people see your game, but it's still worth drilling in a little bit.

43
00:03:57,624 --> 00:04:08,429
So this is a graph showing wishlist activity on the X.O.1 Steam page, beginning in May 2021, first time when we first started the TikTok account, and running all the way up to launch.

44
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:14,315
I should probably explain before we go any further what a wishlist is for those of you who don't know.

45
00:04:14,695 --> 00:04:17,639
You can essentially think of it as sort of a tier below a pre-order.

46
00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:27,509
It's a button that you can click on a Steam page which will basically say to Steam, hey, I'm not willing to put money on the line just yet, but I might potentially want to buy this game somewhere down the line.

47
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,073
So when the game launches, they get an email, they get another one when it goes on sale.

48
00:04:32,112 --> 00:04:41,217
As indie developers in this PC space, this is kind of the best tool that we have to figure out how well something is going to do prior to actually putting it on sale.

49
00:04:41,898 --> 00:04:46,721
And it's also something that Steam uses to decide what kind of positioning to give your game within the Steam storefront.

50
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:53,765
So you get a lot of wishlists, your game gets good featuring on Steam, which then gets it more wishlists, yada, yada, yada, wishlists are very, very good.

51
00:04:54,962 --> 00:05:02,164
I was able to map the witch list activity on the X01 Steam page pretty consistently to the viral videos that we had over that time period.

52
00:05:02,204 --> 00:05:18,107
You can see, got a nice big spike with our first ever video there, had another viral video a little while later which didn't convert quite as well, whole bunch of little bumps, and then we had a nice spike when we put the game's demo on the Next Fest, and then an even bigger one when we advertised that demo on TikTok.

53
00:05:20,515 --> 00:05:29,217
And when we launched X01, we had 100,000 wish lists, which for a little game like that from a solo developer with a publisher that was like five people at the time was really amazing.

54
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:34,598
And I really think the numbers show that TikTok contributed to us having that.

55
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:42,339
If you want an even starker example of this, this is a graph that was kindly donated to me by Kila.

56
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:43,939
She's a developer of a game called Mail Time.

57
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,140
Kila has a fantastic TikTok account that you should all check out.

58
00:05:48,246 --> 00:05:52,770
But you can see here the wishlist spikes Akila gets from a big TikTok.

59
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:59,757
So these all have got about 1 million views each, but the wishlist conversion is about the same as she got from the Future Games show at Gamescom.

60
00:06:00,698 --> 00:06:10,008
So yes, in summary, provided that you make good use of the single link that TikTok allows you to have in your bio, you can see real tangible growth from this platform.

61
00:06:13,015 --> 00:06:20,442
So I think one of the things, aside from just fear of embarrassment, what keeps a lot of developers off TikTok is just not knowing where to begin.

62
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:25,267
So before we dive into the nitty gritty, I just really wanted to quickly share with you my workflow.

63
00:06:27,489 --> 00:06:30,572
Sounds are the backbone of TikTok.

64
00:06:30,912 --> 00:06:34,556
It's one of the few social media platforms where people actually engage with the sounds.

65
00:06:34,898 --> 00:06:37,260
And so in my opinion, that's where you should begin.

66
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,823
If you don't know where to start, you can get a sound either from the TikTok app itself, or you can download it from YouTube.

67
00:06:42,364 --> 00:06:48,508
Take that sound, take whatever footage you want to use and go over to your preferred video editing software.

68
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:56,214
Do all the fiddly stuff on your computer, because if you try to edit the entire thing in the TikTok in-app editor, you will go insane.

69
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:01,612
Once that's done and you have a bit of video that you're happy with, take it back to TikTok.

70
00:07:02,353 --> 00:07:05,655
And this is the tricky bit, and this is the part that I always have to explain to clients.

71
00:07:06,075 --> 00:07:11,118
You then want to find whatever sound you're using in the TikTok sound library, put it back in the video.

72
00:07:11,658 --> 00:07:18,442
This is a way of, for example, if you're using a Doja Cat sound, you want to find that Doja Cat sound in the library, put it in the video, and have it as a soundtrack.

73
00:07:18,582 --> 00:07:23,865
Therefore, other people who are enjoying that same wonderful little bit of music will be recommended your content.

74
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,153
Then now that's tricky bits done, start having fun.

75
00:07:27,633 --> 00:07:30,797
Do cap cut edits, which is a new feature where you can have a kind of

76
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,761
editing format put in the video for you.

77
00:07:32,861 --> 00:07:33,821
Or you can do green screen.

78
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:35,162
Or you can do silly voices.

79
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:39,724
Like, whatever fun, ridiculous thing you want to have, do that in the TikTok editor.

80
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,806
And the last thing you do before you upload, add a caption.

81
00:07:43,306 --> 00:07:47,288
Like I said before, a lot of young people are using TikTok to kind of search for things, similar to Google.

82
00:07:47,628 --> 00:07:49,689
And they also have kind of an SEO system.

83
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:57,413
So drop a couple keywords into the caption, choose a couple cool hashtags, and then upload the video, sit back, and wait to go viral.

84
00:08:00,352 --> 00:08:03,333
and wait and wait and wait because it's not going to happen right away.

85
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:07,776
TikTok is really hard and there's like thousands and thousands of people uploading videos every single day.

86
00:08:08,336 --> 00:08:10,778
So how do you stand out?

87
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,259
You stand out by blending in.

88
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:14,980
Counterintuitive, I know.

89
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,402
But this is something that we've learned over time.

90
00:08:19,442 --> 00:08:27,787
So for example, one of the first things we do when we have like a brand new TikTok account for a game that no one's ever seen before is upload a trailer because a trailer is a really nice asset

91
00:08:28,322 --> 00:08:30,943
it's, you know, why wouldn't you put it on another platform, right?

92
00:08:31,664 --> 00:08:33,484
And that's exactly what we did with X01.

93
00:08:33,885 --> 00:08:47,551
We uploaded two extremely beautiful trailers to the account, and they wound up getting, I think, about 29,000 views each, which is great, but compared to an account where most of the videos got hundreds of thousands, it's a significant overperformance.

94
00:08:48,211 --> 00:08:48,391
Over?

95
00:08:48,631 --> 00:08:49,171
Underperformance.

96
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:51,933
And the reason, I believe, for this is

97
00:08:53,017 --> 00:08:54,698
TikTok has a young audience, right?

98
00:08:55,378 --> 00:09:06,882
And the thing about young people, people of, you know, that kind of late 90s, early 2000s milieu, is that we have been bombarded with advertising from pretty much the second we opened our little eyes and saw the world.

99
00:09:07,322 --> 00:09:09,103
And we are really, really good at detecting it.

100
00:09:10,063 --> 00:09:18,006
Anything that looks too polished, sounds too nice, has too much, you know, effort and money put into it, our brain goes, uh-uh, that's advertising.

101
00:09:18,187 --> 00:09:19,487
And we will flickerate, right?

102
00:09:19,647 --> 00:09:21,608
And the whole point of TikTok is you don't want people to do that.

103
00:09:22,693 --> 00:09:26,643
So how do you keep people from switching off your video right away?

104
00:09:27,384 --> 00:09:30,351
This is a point so important that I've given it its own slide.

105
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:34,269
Make a TikTok that looks like a TikTok.

106
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,530
Obviously, seems stupid, right?

107
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,450
How do you do that?

108
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,351
How do you make a TikTok that looks like a TikTok?

109
00:09:41,671 --> 00:09:43,051
I'll tell you, there's three words in it.

110
00:09:43,431 --> 00:09:44,832
Low production value.

111
00:09:46,012 --> 00:09:53,893
Why go to the studio and film yourself in like a bunch of nice cameras when you could just put your phone on your dresser and talk straight to the camera?

112
00:09:53,973 --> 00:09:56,514
Why use OBS when you could just film your screen?

113
00:09:57,774 --> 00:10:03,776
As long as you are using the tools that a teenager with zero resources would use, you will look like you blend in.

114
00:10:04,677 --> 00:10:12,799
At its most simple, blending in can literally just be the thing that I showed you before with that Europa video, which is a short, unbroken clip of gameplay.

115
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:21,162
And the reason this works, where tightly edited trailers do not, is that instead of speaking in the language of advertisements, you're speaking in the language of Let's Plays and Twitch streams.

116
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,223
In short, you look like you belong.

117
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,650
The next thing I want to dive into is trends.

118
00:10:28,512 --> 00:10:34,506
So TikTok was originally a karaoke app, and music is still very much woven into the DNA of how TikTok functions.

119
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:41,152
So on TikTok, you will have these things called viral sounds, which is basically a single sound clip that is being reused over multiple videos.

120
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:42,693
And this could be anything.

121
00:10:42,873 --> 00:10:44,614
It could be a little bit of a song.

122
00:10:44,754 --> 00:10:46,174
It could be a bit of a comedy skit.

123
00:10:46,494 --> 00:10:49,656
It could be Louis Theroux rapping auto-tuned to Pash Bell's Canon.

124
00:10:50,156 --> 00:10:53,277
I don't know why that one did so well, but God, we had a whole month of Louis Theroux.

125
00:10:54,717 --> 00:11:00,980
And the point is, these can imply either a certain format to the video or just a certain vibe.

126
00:11:01,945 --> 00:11:07,687
but they give you a format to map your video onto.

127
00:11:09,888 --> 00:11:21,153
This not only will give you a lot of ideas, if you're running out of ideas, and it will not only make you look like you belong on TikTok, it will also help you find an audience, again, through the aforementioned algorithms.

128
00:11:21,173 --> 00:11:25,355
It's all about giving TikTok little signals as to who they want to show the video to.

129
00:11:27,913 --> 00:11:28,113
at all.

130
00:11:45,427 --> 00:11:46,327
So that's how he does it.

131
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:48,808
I have a different strategy, which is that I have no life.

132
00:11:49,928 --> 00:11:51,628
And I'm just on TikTok all the time.

133
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,649
And really, there is no replacement for just being immersed in the app.

134
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:57,609
Every social media app has its own cadence.

135
00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:01,550
You know, like on Twitter, you have to sound like sanctimonious and annoying, etc.

136
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:08,151
The more you immerse yourself in TikTok, the easier it will be able to come to match the cadence of the platform.

137
00:12:08,451 --> 00:12:13,472
So yeah, get on there, start watching, and soon you too will become completely insufferable like me.

138
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:19,540
To make the next point, I want to show you another TikTok video.

139
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,060
This is from the ExoOne account.

140
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:23,381
It's a video that got 1.7 million views.

141
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:51,669
So the thing that I want to highlight about that video is the visuals.

142
00:12:52,349 --> 00:12:59,072
TikTok is first and foremost a dopamine treadmill and it encourages you to make snap decisions about whether or not what you're looking at is for you.

143
00:12:59,552 --> 00:13:06,595
You are literally competing with n plus one people all the time, so showing something good in the first second is paramount.

144
00:13:07,844 --> 00:13:16,553
Visually compelling games like X01, like Omno, have an obviously massive advantage in this field, but remember kids, ugly games go viral too.

145
00:13:17,554 --> 00:13:25,723
What you have to do is just show them something visually compelling, be it beautiful, funny, weird, whatever it is, just have it on screen right away.

146
00:13:25,843 --> 00:13:29,366
If you're not showing them your lovely face, you have to give them something cool to look at.

147
00:13:30,341 --> 00:13:32,883
The other thing that we do in that video is we establish context.

148
00:13:33,283 --> 00:13:39,588
Because of the way TikTok works, the vast majority of people who view your video will be viewing that thing for the first time.

149
00:13:39,728 --> 00:13:40,869
They have no idea who you are.

150
00:13:41,049 --> 00:13:42,810
So you need to communicate two things right away.

151
00:13:43,231 --> 00:13:44,732
One, that what they're seeing is a game.

152
00:13:45,512 --> 00:13:47,214
And two, that it is a game that you have made.

153
00:13:48,214 --> 00:13:51,657
It's easy to forget this because we are surrounded by game people all the time.

154
00:13:52,057 --> 00:14:08,842
but this is a really cool thing to do for a living and if you express it this is a game that you have helped create not only will you put yourself in a position of authority you'll also like pique people's curiosity right away they will make a connection with you and be compelled to hopefully find out more

155
00:14:13,088 --> 00:14:15,010
Up next, the power of personality.

156
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:24,598
So Victoria Tran, who is like an incredible powerhouse community manager from InnerSloth, last year released a fantastic post-mortem of the Among Us TikTok account.

157
00:14:25,292 --> 00:14:39,154
And one of the things she found in that post-mortem is that while updates for Among Us got the best view numbers, personality-driven content, so that's just Victoria clowning around on the phone, those got the best engagement.

158
00:14:39,895 --> 00:14:46,476
And having been working on TikTok for over two years now, the power of personality is something that I think really, really holds up.

159
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:53,397
Most of the really big powerhouse video game accounts are ones that make use of a human voice and a friendly face.

160
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:57,129
You know, so example, Landfall, 1.5 million followers.

161
00:14:57,549 --> 00:14:59,091
Tiny Glade, that's another recent hit.

162
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:03,074
They both have kind of a human presence on all or most of their videos.

163
00:15:04,287 --> 00:15:08,648
However, you don't have to be hugely charismatic in order for this to work.

164
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:14,869
So most of the X01 account videos were similar to the thing you just saw, just footage in text.

165
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:19,750
But we were able to persuade developer Jay to lend his voice to two videos.

166
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:25,671
And he read those words out in his best, dull, I don't want to be here, Australian monotone.

167
00:15:26,931 --> 00:15:33,652
And they got 2.7 and 9 million views respectively, making them the highest performing videos on the entire account.

168
00:15:35,112 --> 00:15:43,935
The appeal of TikTok, I think, is fundamentally the same as the appeal of YouTube and Twitch and Twitter and everything else, which is that it is a friend in your pocket.

169
00:15:44,636 --> 00:15:49,357
If you want to watch a trailer and read a press release, there are an infinite number of places where you can go and do that.

170
00:15:49,838 --> 00:15:58,181
But the opportunity you have, the thing you can offer people here, is a chance to make a really small but meaningful connection with the real human beings who make the stuff they love.

171
00:15:58,741 --> 00:16:04,123
And if you can offer that to people, you will get yourself not just a viewer, but an audience member, hopefully.

172
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:07,739
Next up, watch times.

173
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,924
This is some data that was very kindly donated to me by Jared of Devolver.

174
00:16:14,504 --> 00:16:20,649
He did a really fantastic deep dive into one and a half thousand different TikTok accounts from indie games.

175
00:16:20,849 --> 00:16:28,695
And one of his many findings was that watch time and total watch percentage have a strong correlation with how many views a video gets overall.

176
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:32,438
And this has been backed up by an investigation from the Wall Street Journal a couple of years ago.

177
00:16:32,861 --> 00:16:40,124
which again found that full watch percentage is at the heart of how TikTok decides whether or not your video is worth putting on people's pages.

178
00:16:41,145 --> 00:16:49,308
So in short, whether or not people get to the end of your video and whether or not they then go back and watch it again is a really significant factor in how well you're going to do.

179
00:16:51,169 --> 00:17:00,153
Now obviously, figuring out how to make people watch your stuff to the end is like the question and you could ask 100 community managers and get 101 different responses.

180
00:17:00,623 --> 00:17:06,948
But I have a theory, which is I believe that it boils down to structure.

181
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:12,332
Structure as in setup and payoff, a two-part structure.

182
00:17:12,472 --> 00:17:18,397
So how it started versus how it's going is a phrase that you see all over the place on TikTok, not just in the indie game sphere.

183
00:17:19,157 --> 00:17:23,700
And the reason I think that people keep using this over and over again is because it works really well.

184
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:29,002
You give people the promise of something cool while showing them something intriguing.

185
00:17:29,503 --> 00:17:32,884
And if you can pay off that promise with something cool, you're golden.

186
00:17:32,924 --> 00:17:37,687
You've fulfilled your contract as a, you know, three second bit of entertainment for them.

187
00:17:39,497 --> 00:17:44,721
But of course, that is only one way that you can use the setup and payoff method.

188
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:47,523
There's infinite ways to apply this if you really think about it.

189
00:17:47,883 --> 00:17:49,344
Lists is an absolute classic one.

190
00:17:50,085 --> 00:17:55,369
Three fantastic environments in my game, and then you show three fantastic environments, or three funny glitches, yada yada.

191
00:17:56,229 --> 00:17:57,831
Most jokes have a one-two setup.

192
00:17:58,471 --> 00:18:01,573
you know, show something serious and then contrast it with something silly.

193
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:04,875
We love to do this for vampire survivors, works like a charm.

194
00:18:06,036 --> 00:18:07,456
And of course, you have the Q&A format.

195
00:18:07,777 --> 00:18:16,202
TikTok has a native feature where people can leave questions and you can answer that question with a video, which means you're basically giving them the setup and payoff almost at the same time.

196
00:18:17,303 --> 00:18:20,525
And if you're feeling really bold, you can combine multiple formats.

197
00:18:20,905 --> 00:18:32,152
So this video we have here is the TikTok video we made announcing that Vampire Survivors was coming to Xbox, where I combined a Q&A format feature with a funny trending sound at the time.

198
00:18:33,432 --> 00:18:34,413
Let's watch it together now.

199
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:47,252
Coming to Xbox November 10.

200
00:18:51,816 --> 00:18:57,760
That video got almost as many views as the official Xbox trailer on the official Xbox YouTube account.

201
00:18:58,901 --> 00:19:00,782
And it took me 25 minutes to make.

202
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:03,884
And most of that time was spent making the bats.

203
00:19:05,766 --> 00:19:06,766
So, yeah.

204
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:07,907
Setup and payoff.

205
00:19:08,127 --> 00:19:08,548
It works.

206
00:19:10,685 --> 00:19:18,493
My final clothing thought, the sort of thing that I want to leave you with to chew over as you go have your coffees and hang out, is stick with it.

207
00:19:19,474 --> 00:19:24,359
Finding your voice, finding your tone, finding your workflow, all of this stuff takes time.

208
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,001
So be kind to yourself.

209
00:19:26,562 --> 00:19:29,565
As far as we can tell, TikTok does not penalize you for failing.

210
00:19:30,018 --> 00:19:34,622
if you make a bunch of videos that no one sees, that doesn't affect the likelihood of your next video doing well.

211
00:19:34,982 --> 00:19:37,385
And I know this because that's exactly what happened with X01, right?

212
00:19:37,425 --> 00:19:43,450
Me and Thomas were having a competition to see who could go viral first, but everything we posted just got like a couple thousand views.

213
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:44,371
Very depressing.

214
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:48,735
And then after I think about a half dozen tries, suddenly overnight, half a million.

215
00:19:49,711 --> 00:19:53,354
So yeah, keep trying, fall on your face, fail, pick yourself up, try again.

216
00:19:54,315 --> 00:19:55,836
It's a dancing app for children.

217
00:19:57,017 --> 00:19:58,439
Don't get too stressed about it.

218
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:07,667
It's more about, it's less about creating a single perfect thing than it is about spinning the roulette wheel enough times until you get, you hit on something that works.

219
00:20:09,188 --> 00:20:12,291
Now because of that algorithm-driven format,

220
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:33,853
Everything that you start, you have a blank slate, not just with every account, but with every video that you post, which is obviously really exhausting and frustrating at times, yes, but it means that you also have an infinite amount of fresh starts and that you never know what's going to happen next.

221
00:20:36,533 --> 00:20:38,534
And yep, this is just some of the sources I used.

222
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,515
So Jared, Victoria, Thomas, Wall Street Journal.

223
00:20:43,315 --> 00:20:44,996
Yes, that's my talk.

224
00:20:45,016 --> 00:20:45,656
Thanks so much, everyone.

225
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,340
Wow, I zoomed through that super fast.

226
00:20:58,521 --> 00:21:00,081
I was talking super speedy.

227
00:21:00,101 --> 00:21:02,262
But yes, if anyone has any questions, I think we have time now.

228
00:21:04,225 --> 00:21:11,376
I have a question about length of videos, because you mentioned watch percentage heavily correlates with performance.

229
00:21:13,104 --> 00:21:16,226
the immediate logic is make a really short video.

230
00:21:16,767 --> 00:21:17,787
Does that work or not?

231
00:21:17,867 --> 00:21:18,768
I think that was another thing.

232
00:21:19,168 --> 00:21:22,250
You should go back and read Jared's talk because this is something he went into as well.

233
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:28,435
There is kind of a sweet spot, which I believe is at around the 15 to 30 second mark, but it's not a huge factor.

234
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:31,837
If you have a really fantastic 30 second video, I think you still have a good choice of that.

235
00:21:32,117 --> 00:21:38,862
Don't just upload a bunch of two second clips and hope that people don't get the time to get past because I'm pretty sure TikTok has allowed for that to not happen.

236
00:21:39,502 --> 00:21:43,384
we tend to hit around the 15 to 30 second mark and we find that works pretty well consistently.

237
00:21:44,045 --> 00:21:44,325
Thank you.

238
00:21:44,905 --> 00:21:45,165
No worries.

239
00:21:46,606 --> 00:21:46,866
Over there.

240
00:21:47,146 --> 00:21:48,147
Hey, thanks so much for the talk.

241
00:21:48,387 --> 00:21:48,707
No worries.

242
00:21:48,847 --> 00:21:51,909
I was wondering, our future friends, how much do you guys focus on post timing?

243
00:21:51,949 --> 00:21:56,712
Like what day or what hour of that day posting certain videos or do you guys just post whenever and let it go viral?

244
00:21:57,763 --> 00:22:01,387
I think we tend to aim for late afternoon, early evening.

245
00:22:01,527 --> 00:22:06,312
Just anecdotally, that's when we found videos tend to do their best, because that's when people are kind of online.

246
00:22:06,552 --> 00:22:08,033
We also think really hard about regions.

247
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:17,183
So TikToks that are posted from North America and the UK have a tendency to reach more people than those that are uploaded from Europe, because it's set to your IP address.

248
00:22:20,675 --> 00:22:25,456
But it's all kind of a black magic, like we don't have hard data on when's best or not.

249
00:22:25,617 --> 00:22:33,079
But yeah, posting the video when roughly you think that people are going to be online and posting it from a country where a lot of people live generally works for us.

250
00:22:33,859 --> 00:22:34,159
Thank you.

251
00:22:34,499 --> 00:22:34,759
No worries.

252
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,620
Thanks very much for the talk.

253
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:43,422
Do you find in practical terms it's better to have a publisher account or a developer account or a personal account or account per game?

254
00:22:45,595 --> 00:22:46,716
That's a big question.

255
00:22:46,756 --> 00:22:48,256
I mean, we've had success with both formats.

256
00:22:48,436 --> 00:22:55,919
The one thing I'll say, having a business account, I think it's helpful for ads, but it imposes a lot of limitations in terms of what sounds you use.

257
00:22:56,259 --> 00:22:59,820
So we find it's easier to go viral with like a personal non-business account.

258
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,601
But again, because of that format where everything is being kind of seen for the first time.

259
00:23:04,942 --> 00:23:09,363
So when we worked on Hype Train, they obviously have a whole bunch of different games, and we were able to kind of

260
00:23:09,823 --> 00:23:12,165
go viral with a bunch of different individual videos, right?

261
00:23:12,185 --> 00:23:17,389
So we had one introducing Euro Truck World, another one introducing Void Train, and they kind of did well individually.

262
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:29,479
However, if you want to, if basically, if you want to do a landfall or do an inner sloth, where you have kind of an audience that you're gathering over time and kind of earning their trust, it's probably better to focus on one game at a time per account.

263
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,660
Cool, thank you very much.

264
00:23:30,841 --> 00:23:31,101
No worries.

265
00:23:33,139 --> 00:23:48,658
Hi, before you recommended to edit outside the TikTok platform because you would go crazy otherwise, but you also recommended to blend in and have a low production value by not editing too much, so where do you draw the line?

266
00:23:50,019 --> 00:23:51,899
I mean, again, that's like a really open question.

267
00:23:51,939 --> 00:23:57,000
I think if you look at something like Cult of the Lamb, they have really fantastic videos which actually have quite a high production value.

268
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,321
And they get away with that because their game is extremely beautiful and entertaining and they make excellent content.

269
00:24:02,061 --> 00:24:06,842
For me, what I tend to do is I like the work to be kind of invisible.

270
00:24:07,202 --> 00:24:08,682
So I want the cups to be really smooth.

271
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:10,203
I want the gameplay to be really clear.

272
00:24:10,663 --> 00:24:12,963
That's the kind of thing that people take for granted, essentially.

273
00:24:13,843 --> 00:24:17,824
But once I have something that sort of matches very well to the beat of the song,

274
00:24:18,384 --> 00:24:21,505
then I take that to TikTok and I do the kind of scrappy stuff on there.

275
00:24:21,725 --> 00:24:26,026
But I think that's really more about what kind of ceiling, how much time you have.

276
00:24:26,706 --> 00:24:31,147
Like I'm not a professional video editor and I tend to not have a huge amount of time to do these things.

277
00:24:31,187 --> 00:24:32,868
So that's where I'd personally draw the line.

278
00:24:32,908 --> 00:24:35,689
But I think it's a case of figuring out what works for you over time.

279
00:24:36,569 --> 00:24:36,809
Thank you.

280
00:24:37,249 --> 00:24:37,429
Always.

281
00:24:38,507 --> 00:24:42,212
Hi, how do you feel about content re-sharing?

282
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:47,118
So you have previously shared a video and it was a success or a failure and you re-share it.

283
00:24:47,198 --> 00:24:51,984
Can it rework a second time and can it beat the first failure?

284
00:24:52,802 --> 00:24:53,783
Ooh, that's a good question.

285
00:24:54,283 --> 00:24:55,924
Do you mean like resharing on TikTok?

286
00:24:56,525 --> 00:24:59,227
It's not something we've done a lot, to be honest.

287
00:24:59,467 --> 00:25:01,668
It's something that kind of leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

288
00:25:01,748 --> 00:25:06,672
I would rather try again with something new than to kind of keep uploading the same thing over and over again.

289
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:14,157
However, resharing on YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels and TikTok and Reddit and other places, I really strongly recommend you do.

290
00:25:15,298 --> 00:25:31,395
we've actually had quite a modest good amount of success with vampire survivors if you're sharing on YouTube shorts so yeah I would I would recommend doing that but for the most part I would rather pour that energy into just like making and having another attempt with something quick thanks no worries

291
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:34,940
Hi, great talk.

292
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:40,882
I'd like to ask for a solution for a very specific problem.

293
00:25:41,243 --> 00:25:49,926
We live in a non-English speaking country and when we post a TikTok it gets shown to people from our own country.

294
00:25:50,706 --> 00:26:05,875
so if we make it in our local language it will never go to global audience obviously and if we post in English we have pretty bad engagement so do you have a solution for this problem maybe?

295
00:26:06,718 --> 00:26:08,200
This is the eternal question.

296
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:14,169
I think generally what we would recommend you do is just hire a community manager in the UK and have them post from there.

297
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:21,179
That's why I think the reason that you're probably getting bad engagement on those videos is that even though they're in the English language, they're still getting shown to local audiences.

298
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,342
So you're kind of damned if you do, damned if you don't, right?

299
00:26:24,362 --> 00:26:27,123
Because if you make a video in the native language, you're reaching less people.

300
00:26:27,163 --> 00:26:30,785
But if you make a video in English, you're sort of not speaking in the language of your local community.

301
00:26:30,865 --> 00:26:38,230
So annoyingly, it does help to just kind of either do a bit of subterfuge with a VPN or post from a different region.

302
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:39,871
OK, thanks.

303
00:26:40,171 --> 00:26:40,411
No worries.

304
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:50,752
I was a couple minutes late so I apologize if I covered this already.

305
00:26:51,592 --> 00:26:58,393
You mentioned YouTube Shorts and we know that TikTok is very open to letting people download and share on other platforms.

306
00:26:59,593 --> 00:27:06,935
What have you seen in terms of being able to track analytics or how that goes on to other non-TikTok platforms and how that

307
00:27:08,607 --> 00:27:15,252
I mean, we haven't done like a real, for us, this has just basically been, it doesn't take a lot of time and there's no drawbacks, so just throw it out there.

308
00:27:15,293 --> 00:27:22,839
We haven't looked super hard, frankly, because the performance has not been impressive enough for us to really want to deep dive into reels or shorts just yet.

309
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:27,943
I think if we started seeing numbers that were comparable to what we were seeing on TikTok, we might pay more attention.

310
00:27:28,264 --> 00:27:34,949
But for now, it's more just a matter of giving ourselves sort of a wider, just a bigger shot, right?

311
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:43,136
But yeah, TikTok is still very much the number one platform for us, and that has the massive organic reach that we just don't have anywhere else.

312
00:27:43,576 --> 00:27:43,877
Thank you.

313
00:27:44,157 --> 00:27:44,437
No worries.

314
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:47,499
Hi, thank you so much for your talk.

315
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:55,386
You showed at the very beginning a pretty beautiful correlation between the videos and the Weasley.

316
00:27:56,607 --> 00:28:01,270
And my question is, do you have more information about this Weasley?

317
00:28:02,391 --> 00:28:03,952
I mean, profile a day?

318
00:28:04,973 --> 00:28:05,033
of

319
00:28:18,811 --> 00:28:20,332
Yes, the conversion is worse.

320
00:28:20,672 --> 00:28:22,013
Yes, 100%, I think.

321
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:27,816
Wishlist conversions from TikTok are generally not as strong as when you build up a personal brand elsewhere.

322
00:28:27,856 --> 00:28:35,020
And this is something that comes up a lot with people like, oh, yes, you got 5,000 wishlists that you wouldn't have had elsewhere, but they're not as good.

323
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,401
And it's like, yes, they are not as good.

324
00:28:36,601 --> 00:28:43,584
However, between the choice of not having those wishlists and having another 5,000 that are not as good, I'll take the latter, right?

325
00:28:44,945 --> 00:28:55,029
So yeah, it is weaker conversion, sadly, but I think it's kind of worth making that bargain just to have that extra profile, especially considering how it will contribute to your game being promoted within Steam.

326
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,290
We still think it's worth it, basically.

327
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,371
Yeah, absolutely.

328
00:28:58,411 --> 00:28:58,571
Yes.

329
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:00,231
To set expectations.

330
00:29:00,251 --> 00:29:00,591
Yeah, yeah.

331
00:29:00,631 --> 00:29:04,453
I have thousands and thousands of users, but then they only convert 1%.

332
00:29:04,933 --> 00:29:05,854
Yes, exactly.

333
00:29:05,874 --> 00:29:06,134
Thank you.

334
00:29:06,474 --> 00:29:06,794
No worries.

335
00:29:09,841 --> 00:29:13,924
Where are you actually making the ask for someone to wish list?

336
00:29:13,984 --> 00:29:15,985
In the video, in your bio, in the description?

337
00:29:16,825 --> 00:29:17,846
We tend to have it in the bio.

338
00:29:19,667 --> 00:29:29,653
Again, I think Thomas made a great point in the talk he did before mine, which is that you shouldn't hammer home too much with the calls to action, because people on TikTok are so apathetic and disengaged that if you ask them

339
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:32,240
to actually click on something else, I'll just be like, oh, no.

340
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:40,245
So it's better to do engagement farming, asking, would you play this, or what do you want to see next kind of things, and get more engagement.

341
00:29:40,565 --> 00:29:46,108
And then the few number of people who are actually curious enough to click through the profile, that's when you hit them with the wish list and give them the link.

342
00:29:46,388 --> 00:29:52,091
And you want to have as little friction as possible between that action of going to the bio and getting to the Steam page to hit the link.

343
00:29:52,571 --> 00:29:53,912
So that's what you should focus on.

344
00:29:53,932 --> 00:29:54,232
Thank you.

345
00:29:54,513 --> 00:29:54,813
No worries.

346
00:29:56,894 --> 00:29:57,034
Hello.

347
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:06,510
Do you think about people playing your game being able to make tiktokable content from the game or are you mostly focused on you posting the videos?

348
00:30:06,995 --> 00:30:09,257
Yeah, it's not something we consider, to be honest.

349
00:30:09,337 --> 00:30:15,781
I mean, the TikTok, like, influencer world is something that's still growing, and we're still kind of figuring out what that looks like, right?

350
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:21,926
So we generally try and focus on just making something that's really beautiful and compelling and easy from our perspective.

351
00:30:22,506 --> 00:30:32,593
And we still see the best, again, like I said, in terms of conversion, making a game that performs really well on Twitch and YouTube for an influencer standpoint is still kind of more beneficial to us.

352
00:30:34,026 --> 00:30:35,851
but it's not something that you optimize for.

353
00:30:36,092 --> 00:30:36,392
Oh God.

354
00:30:36,432 --> 00:30:36,934
No, no, no, no.

355
00:30:37,014 --> 00:30:40,583
We don't, we don't like go to our indie devs and say, you should do this cause it's better for TikTok.

356
00:30:40,624 --> 00:30:40,844
Right.

357
00:30:40,904 --> 00:30:42,067
We don't want to, um,

358
00:30:42,864 --> 00:30:43,104
how to

359
00:31:11,092 --> 00:31:13,974
You talked about followers, watch time, views.

360
00:31:14,054 --> 00:31:18,618
What is the main KPI you follow to check what you're doing?

361
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:20,299
Sorry, can you repeat that?

362
00:31:20,939 --> 00:31:26,063
What is the main key indicator factor, key performance indicator that you're following?

363
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:29,886
For instance, you talked about followers.

364
00:31:30,286 --> 00:31:31,127
Is that super important?

365
00:31:31,838 --> 00:31:31,898
up

366
00:31:46,434 --> 00:31:47,235
on a bigger scale.

367
00:31:47,675 --> 00:31:52,539
But yeah, you can have a lot of followers and have a lot of duds, you can have no followers and do really well.

368
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:58,325
So while that kind of indicates our growth over time, we don't use that too much as a metric of how well we're doing.

369
00:31:59,186 --> 00:32:01,668
We just try to think about what we're going to do next, ultimately.

370
00:32:03,244 --> 00:32:04,005
Thank you so much.

371
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:23,083
where it's in lands and we're taking that sort of TikTok ability into account.

372
00:32:23,244 --> 00:32:30,970
But one question is our stuff is landscape and TikTok is obviously portrait.

373
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:34,112
So just curious if you have any thoughts on that.

374
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:44,320
Would you just use sort of like closer in shot so that you always get something in portrait or does it work to put landscape video

375
00:32:45,077 --> 00:32:45,257
you have

376
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:09,392
So if you're going to have black bars either side of the video, I think sometimes it can be fine.

377
00:33:09,733 --> 00:33:11,113
Use that information well, right?

378
00:33:11,173 --> 00:33:13,494
So put some good text there, maybe put a call to action.

379
00:33:13,934 --> 00:33:14,815
Use it as best you can.

380
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:21,798
Yeah, and think about your game from the perspective of someone who has no attention span whatsoever.

381
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:24,660
What was the game that you suggested?

382
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,800
Clone Drone in the Danger Zone.

383
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,382
So they do a lot of clever visual tricks to kind of fill up the screen, even though it's a landscape game.

384
00:33:30,402 --> 00:33:30,882
Got it.

385
00:33:31,103 --> 00:33:31,663
Thank you.

386
00:33:32,671 --> 00:33:33,772
Yes, I think that's all done.

387
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:34,633
Thank you so much, everyone.

388
00:33:35,394 --> 00:33:37,557
I will be hanging around for chats afterwards, but cheers, guys.
