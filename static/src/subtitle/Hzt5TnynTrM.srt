1
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,642
In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

2
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:49,248
And the earth was without form, and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep.

3
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:53,372
And the Spirit of God moved upon the waters.

4
00:00:54,713 --> 00:00:58,516
And God said, Let there be light.

5
00:00:59,837 --> 00:01:03,641
And there was light, and God saw the light, that it was good.

6
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:05,983
And God called the light day.

7
00:01:06,835 --> 00:01:11,940
And the darkness he called night, and the evening, and the morning were the first day.

8
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,705
Hello everyone. This is The Secret of Eternal Product Life.

9
00:01:18,685 --> 00:01:23,530
I'm Ernest Adams, and you've just heard the creation myth of the Israelites.

10
00:01:24,831 --> 00:01:28,033
I want to start off with my usual disclaimers, and I always have to give at these things.

11
00:01:28,634 --> 00:01:31,596
What I'm about to say is not the opinion of my employers.

12
00:01:31,616 --> 00:01:35,240
The scriptures tend to take the form of sermons.

13
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:38,023
And the sermon is a highly personal view.

14
00:01:38,764 --> 00:01:41,205
Also, for those of you who haven't been to church much lately,

15
00:01:42,106 --> 00:01:44,228
the preacher does not take questions during the sermon.

16
00:01:44,268 --> 00:01:45,889
I'll be happy to talk to people afterwards.

17
00:01:50,492 --> 00:01:54,395
The subtitle of this talk is Lessons from J.R.R. Tolkien and John Madden,

18
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:57,858
Two Men Than Whom It Is Difficult to Imagine More Different.

19
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,062
The first part is the Madden part of the talk.

20
00:02:05,174 --> 00:02:08,817
And basically, to give you the background here, this is a lesson on product longevity.

21
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,479
Now, it's not going to be as boring as that sounds, I hope.

22
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:16,683
Those of you who are familiar with my lectures in the past know that I like to speculate about all kinds of weird stuff.

23
00:02:17,423 --> 00:02:21,186
And the so-called topic of the lecture is really just a hook to hang other ideas on.

24
00:02:21,986 --> 00:02:25,129
I'm not going to be talking about the shelf life of individual SKUs, by the way.

25
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:27,991
I'm talking about the life of entire product lines.

26
00:02:30,468 --> 00:02:35,772
John Madden Football, or as it's known now Madden NFL Football, is the best-selling sports video game of all time.

27
00:02:36,372 --> 00:02:40,656
And it's been around since 1988, in one form or another.

28
00:02:41,096 --> 00:02:46,780
It originally came out on the Apple II, and then it moved to the IBM PC, and then to the Sega Genesis,

29
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:52,525
and then more recently to the Sony PlayStation, the Sega Saturn, and the PC again.

30
00:02:54,653 --> 00:02:56,173
It is an unusually long-lived product.

31
00:02:56,193 --> 00:03:00,194
There are comparatively few products, maybe Ultima, Wizardry, and so on,

32
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:02,575
that have lasted that long, not counting the ones that are online,

33
00:03:02,675 --> 00:03:04,996
which, of course, are continuously updated.

34
00:03:06,136 --> 00:03:09,417
I've been working on John Madden football since 1993,

35
00:03:10,017 --> 00:03:14,018
so I've seen a little bit less, I guess, than half of its product life.

36
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:20,903
And I wanted to start off by talking about some of the things that have, I believe, have helped to make Madden a success.

37
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:25,845
To start with, of course, sports games have some unfair advantages.

38
00:03:28,385 --> 00:03:35,828
How many other industries can you name that have an entire section of the newspaper devoted to them all across the country every day?

39
00:03:37,048 --> 00:03:40,750
You know, there might be a few pages on the aerospace industry in Seattle.

40
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,230
But...

41
00:03:43,088 --> 00:03:46,130
The sports industry has an entire section every single day

42
00:03:46,771 --> 00:03:47,691
all across the country.

43
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:50,753
So there's an enormous amount of interest in sports already.

44
00:03:52,054 --> 00:03:55,156
And the sports industry, or particular sports,

45
00:03:55,216 --> 00:03:56,757
consists of periodic events.

46
00:03:57,297 --> 00:04:00,519
That is, a sports season lasts for a certain amount of time

47
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,300
each year with a great deal of changing data.

48
00:04:03,981 --> 00:04:07,483
So you've always got something to sell people.

49
00:04:08,243 --> 00:04:11,665
And that also gives sports games unfair advantages.

50
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:14,891
Basically, the flight characteristics of an F-16

51
00:04:15,252 --> 00:04:17,213
do not change all that much from year to year.

52
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:19,816
If they do, the general public doesn't know about it.

53
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,298
But the roster of the San Francisco 49ers

54
00:04:22,358 --> 00:04:23,399
does change from year to year.

55
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:26,521
And if you don't have it right, you will find out about it.

56
00:04:28,783 --> 00:04:37,450
However, be that as it may, I think

57
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,853
there are particular reasons for Madden's success.

58
00:04:42,036 --> 00:04:46,639
And the first reason, the one right at the top, is the ever-elusive fun factor.

59
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:54,543
Madden has not always had the greatest graphics and the greatest sound, and I think we would freely admit that.

60
00:04:56,044 --> 00:05:00,807
But it does have an excellent license. It's an easily identifiable individual.

61
00:05:02,156 --> 00:05:05,737
And unlike having a license from a star player,

62
00:05:07,377 --> 00:05:11,699
John Madden is much less likely to get injured or to retire suddenly or something like that.

63
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:14,219
And that obviously helps in product longevity.

64
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:18,300
If you tie yourself to a given player, then you're tying yourself to that player's career.

65
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:25,162
The other thing about Madden with respect to the fun factor is that it is easy to learn and easy to play.

66
00:05:26,482 --> 00:05:28,483
It uses context-sensitive behaviors.

67
00:05:29,157 --> 00:05:30,738
Rather than having a million buttons.

68
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:36,159
Basically, we don't feel that the audience for fighting games,

69
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,400
who are capable of handling complex button sequences,

70
00:05:39,821 --> 00:05:41,761
that make very specific oddball moves,

71
00:05:42,261 --> 00:05:45,142
overlaps that much with the audience for football games.

72
00:05:46,003 --> 00:05:48,843
And so, we try, instead of having a million buttons,

73
00:05:49,304 --> 00:05:53,925
to just have a button that does the right thing at the right time.

74
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:55,526
If you need to hurdle, it will hurdle.

75
00:05:55,566 --> 00:05:56,886
If you need to spin, it will spin.

76
00:05:56,926 --> 00:05:58,547
If you need to jump, it will jump, and so on.

77
00:05:59,853 --> 00:06:03,234
And this simplicity encourages rather than discourages new players.

78
00:06:04,535 --> 00:06:08,277
Now, one of the consequences of this is that it's fairly easy to learn,

79
00:06:08,797 --> 00:06:14,639
and that it, with some practice, becomes fairly easy to beat the AI.

80
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:19,121
And that's kind of the downside of having a game that's easy to learn and easy to get into.

81
00:06:19,762 --> 00:06:24,464
But Madden has always really been thought of as a multiplayer game anyway.

82
00:06:27,338 --> 00:06:31,401
Sold rather like a single player game like all the other cartridges on the shelves.

83
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:34,823
But the vast majority of the aficionados play it as a multiplayer game.

84
00:06:34,843 --> 00:06:36,244
And that's where the real fun comes in.

85
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:47,231
And we think that it's worth having the downside of the fact that you can beat it 89 to nothing after you've been playing it six months.

86
00:06:48,672 --> 00:06:51,594
To get the upside of having large numbers of people be able to play it.

87
00:06:51,974 --> 00:06:56,157
Now there are counter examples to this out in the industry, of course, you know, IndyCar racing, for example.

88
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,098
is the racing fiend's game.

89
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,540
And it also is a great success.

90
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,342
So nothing of what I'm going to say

91
00:07:04,402 --> 00:07:05,843
is an absolute hard and fast rule.

92
00:07:07,544 --> 00:07:09,605
Another reason that I think Madden has been a success

93
00:07:10,766 --> 00:07:12,007
has to do with a programmer disease

94
00:07:12,047 --> 00:07:12,967
that I'm sure that a number of you

95
00:07:13,007 --> 00:07:15,029
are familiar with called creeping featurism.

96
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:19,052
You know the phenomenon where a programmer's never finished,

97
00:07:19,092 --> 00:07:20,172
because the programmer can always

98
00:07:20,212 --> 00:07:21,933
add one more feature, and then one more feature,

99
00:07:21,954 --> 00:07:22,814
and then one more feature.

100
00:07:23,915 --> 00:07:25,496
And a lot of products kind of get this.

101
00:07:26,702 --> 00:07:30,725
With Madden, we have sort of deliberately made creeping featurism a plus.

102
00:07:30,905 --> 00:07:32,946
We've turned it into a benefit.

103
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:39,650
In 1992, we had neither an NFL nor an NFL Players Association contract.

104
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:43,793
So we had neither genuine team names nor player names.

105
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:47,856
In 93, we had an NFL contract, so we got the team names but not the player names.

106
00:07:48,396 --> 00:07:50,397
In 94, we added the Players Association.

107
00:07:50,915 --> 00:07:52,575
So we had both the players and the teams.

108
00:07:53,136 --> 00:07:55,297
In 95, we started adding old-time teams.

109
00:07:55,577 --> 00:07:58,618
So you could play with the 84 49ers or the 52 Lions.

110
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:02,820
In 1996, we added the ability to trade players among teams.

111
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,403
And then in 1997, we moved to the PSX.

112
00:08:09,123 --> 00:08:12,124
And so we slowed down the pace of putting in new features

113
00:08:12,464 --> 00:08:14,585
to concentrate on handling the new technology.

114
00:08:15,772 --> 00:08:20,757
So creeping featurism, giving them a little something new every year, has obviously helped Madden a great deal.

115
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:32,609
The third reason for Madden's success in my mind, and this is, I think, the most important one, is that it has always placed content before technology.

116
00:08:34,411 --> 00:08:36,473
There are technology-driven games out there.

117
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:43,054
And in my mind, a technology-driven game is a game which is intended to exploit a given technology.

118
00:08:43,475 --> 00:08:49,019
For example, Doom came out, and Doom's real purpose was to exploit and demonstrate raycasting.

119
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:50,901
And it did that extraordinarily well.

120
00:08:51,661 --> 00:08:53,843
But that's really kind of what it's all about.

121
00:08:55,024 --> 00:09:00,088
Another example that comes to mind is Star Fox, which came out specifically to show off Nintendo's FX chip.

122
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:06,273
The problem with doing that is that...

123
00:09:06,703 --> 00:09:08,844
Your technology will be copied in three months.

124
00:09:09,744 --> 00:09:11,885
And three months after that, it will be old news.

125
00:09:12,245 --> 00:09:13,805
Doom comes out and everyone is amazed.

126
00:09:15,705 --> 00:09:18,046
Hexen and other things like it come out and everybody says,

127
00:09:18,126 --> 00:09:19,186
oh yeah, that's a Doom clone.

128
00:09:19,246 --> 00:09:19,686
Big deal.

129
00:09:22,147 --> 00:09:27,928
So new technology with poor content won't get you good

130
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:28,408
reviews.

131
00:09:29,128 --> 00:09:32,169
Critical Path, for example, was the first game to have a

132
00:09:32,229 --> 00:09:33,489
lot of motion video in it.

133
00:09:33,869 --> 00:09:35,030
But it was a poor game.

134
00:09:36,278 --> 00:09:40,159
Old technology with good content can get you good reviews.

135
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,681
Maxis turned out good tile-based games year after year after year.

136
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:49,243
And Civilization certainly was not using a lot of breakthrough technology.

137
00:09:50,443 --> 00:09:53,925
And badly implemented new technology is absolutely the kiss of death.

138
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:59,507
Electronic Arts had a wonderful baseball simulator called Earl Weaver Baseball 1.5

139
00:10:00,047 --> 00:10:05,049
for the Amiga, which generated better baseball simulation statistics.

140
00:10:05,442 --> 00:10:07,704
than anything else on the market at the time.

141
00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:12,807
And so they put out another version called Earl Weaver 2,

142
00:10:13,748 --> 00:10:17,270
and they put a very badly implemented 3D front end on it.

143
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:20,773
And it died a terrible death in the marketplace,

144
00:10:20,793 --> 00:10:23,875
despite the fact that it still had a wonderful baseball

145
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:24,595
sim underneath.

146
00:10:25,135 --> 00:10:27,577
The badly implemented 3D front end just killed it.

147
00:10:32,861 --> 00:10:34,101
So Madden is content driven.

148
00:10:34,817 --> 00:10:39,664
It was originally on the Apple II and the generic PC right at the end of those machines' product life cycles.

149
00:10:40,526 --> 00:10:44,992
And its technology changed relatively slowly during the Genesis years.

150
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:47,396
What changed from year to year was the content.

151
00:10:48,578 --> 00:10:50,899
And when the PSX came along, obviously, we took steps to

152
00:10:50,939 --> 00:10:54,021
support it, and we beefed it up quite a bit.

153
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:57,143
But we did not make the mistake that we had made with

154
00:10:57,203 --> 00:10:58,644
Earl Weaver and try to overdo it.

155
00:10:58,984 --> 00:11:01,706
We wanted to get on the PSX, bring it out, have a good

156
00:11:01,726 --> 00:11:04,227
looking product there without trying to

157
00:11:04,407 --> 00:11:05,488
overstep our abilities.

158
00:11:05,888 --> 00:11:08,410
Because we felt that it was important to be solid on that

159
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:11,812
machine before trying to add truly amazing whiz-bangs.

160
00:11:12,312 --> 00:11:13,353
That's for this year, of course.

161
00:11:14,855 --> 00:11:21,437
So, new technology does not make a game that lasts, because technology does not last itself.

162
00:11:22,357 --> 00:11:24,098
And that's one of the conclusions from Madden.

163
00:11:24,578 --> 00:11:27,859
If you are specifically trying to make a long-lived game,

164
00:11:28,699 --> 00:11:31,720
then I would suggest that what you do is burn developer cycles,

165
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,620
rather than adding too many features at a time.

166
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,681
Use those cycles to tune the game, make the game play better,

167
00:11:39,141 --> 00:11:41,222
rather than burning those cycles to put in new features.

168
00:11:41,882 --> 00:11:44,483
After all, every new feature is two new bugs, right?

169
00:11:46,277 --> 00:11:48,979
Also, emphasize content and features over technology.

170
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,281
You should incorporate technology changes in your

171
00:11:51,321 --> 00:11:52,362
later releases, of course.

172
00:11:52,402 --> 00:11:53,623
You have to in order to keep up.

173
00:11:54,063 --> 00:11:56,325
But don't make that the raison d'etre of the whole product,

174
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,807
not if your point is to create a long-lived game.

175
00:12:01,309 --> 00:12:05,692
And don't go after new technology until you are ready

176
00:12:05,732 --> 00:12:07,434
to use it and until you need to use it.

177
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,838
Going after new technology with a development team that

178
00:12:12,938 --> 00:12:15,540
isn't really qualified to do it is a mistake.

179
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:18,320
And we haven't made that mistake with Madden.

180
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:22,242
Software is not the reason for playing the game.

181
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:24,623
The game is the reason for playing the game.

182
00:12:25,463 --> 00:12:28,405
So that's kind of the Madden portion of the talk.

183
00:12:29,465 --> 00:12:30,726
That will make my employers happy.

184
00:12:31,346 --> 00:12:35,488
And that's the kind of straightforward and direct

185
00:12:36,969 --> 00:12:38,790
thing about product longevity that I wanted to tell you

186
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,090
about, the lessons from John Madden.

187
00:12:49,237 --> 00:12:54,781
In the beginning, the world was inhabited only by animals, and there were no humans.

188
00:12:55,861 --> 00:13:02,185
And the tiger and the bear prayed together to God for wisdom and for betterment of their status.

189
00:13:02,926 --> 00:13:04,367
And they prayed together for many days.

190
00:13:05,707 --> 00:13:09,630
But in time, the tiger became hungry, and he abandoned his prayers to hunt.

191
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:16,094
But the bear continued to pray, and God heard her prayers, and he sent his son down to Earth to speak with her.

192
00:13:16,943 --> 00:13:17,943
And the Son of God said,

193
00:13:18,303 --> 00:13:20,483
For your steadfastness you will be rewarded.

194
00:13:21,224 --> 00:13:22,364
Take these herbs and eat,

195
00:13:23,264 --> 00:13:24,644
and go into this cave and sleep,

196
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:26,585
and you will receive your reward.

197
00:13:26,925 --> 00:13:29,105
And the bear ate the herbs,

198
00:13:29,585 --> 00:13:30,865
and she went into the cave and slept,

199
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,026
but not for a night.

200
00:13:32,626 --> 00:13:33,846
She slept the whole winter through.

201
00:13:34,566 --> 00:13:36,426
And when she emerged in the spring,

202
00:13:37,106 --> 00:13:38,107
the Son of God was there,

203
00:13:38,867 --> 00:13:40,187
and she was no longer a bear,

204
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,087
but the first human woman.

205
00:13:43,128 --> 00:13:44,688
And she did cohabit with the Son of God.

206
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:49,386
And their children became the human race, the Koreans.

207
00:13:53,107 --> 00:13:54,967
So the second part of this talk is kind of the more

208
00:13:55,047 --> 00:13:58,288
speculative part, the kind of Tolkien part of the talk.

209
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:03,950
And I began thinking about these issues of product

210
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:08,751
longevity because one of the things I feel about most

211
00:14:08,831 --> 00:14:11,472
computer games is that they are just about one inch deep.

212
00:14:12,526 --> 00:14:14,947
They don't really feel like they're part of anything larger.

213
00:14:15,308 --> 00:14:20,191
When you get to the end of a computer game, you don't feel like there's a great deal more to go on to.

214
00:14:20,251 --> 00:14:22,773
You feel like you've pretty much seen all that there is to see.

215
00:14:23,874 --> 00:14:25,835
And so our work doesn't last.

216
00:14:27,056 --> 00:14:31,639
And obviously, one reason why our work doesn't last is the inexorable march of technology

217
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:33,501
and the fact that we're constantly having to upgrade that.

218
00:14:33,841 --> 00:14:36,903
But I think that we've shown with Madden that...

219
00:14:37,558 --> 00:14:43,161
You can deal with that, that you can create a product line which lasts despite advances in technology.

220
00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:48,804
That's not necessarily a good excuse for having a product line that doesn't last.

221
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:54,347
I think the real reason that our product lines don't last is that we have a lot of short-term thinking.

222
00:14:54,748 --> 00:14:58,330
We don't really sit down and plan to create product lines that last.

223
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:02,592
I don't know whether it's not something that interests us or we don't have time for it or what it is,

224
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:06,995
but most of the time we're only kind of looking till next Christmas and I think that's too bad.

225
00:15:08,034 --> 00:15:10,615
And I began to think about, well,

226
00:15:10,635 --> 00:15:15,957
what would be the important aspects of long-term successes?

227
00:15:16,397 --> 00:15:18,938
What kinds of conditions might be important to have?

228
00:15:19,979 --> 00:15:23,460
And in my sole concession to audiovisual aids,

229
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:27,182
I will put up my list.

230
00:15:27,202 --> 00:15:36,485
I'm sure there's a switch here somewhere.

231
00:15:36,926 --> 00:15:37,626
Big one on top.

232
00:15:47,451 --> 00:15:48,272
So here's my list.

233
00:15:49,753 --> 00:15:51,134
Compelling activity or premise.

234
00:15:51,214 --> 00:15:55,196
Obviously, you want to have an activity or some kind of an

235
00:15:55,296 --> 00:15:58,359
idea that you want your player to enjoy that will compel them

236
00:15:58,379 --> 00:15:59,499
to come back and want to do it again.

237
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,602
Clearly, you need to have excellent content, good

238
00:16:02,622 --> 00:16:04,543
graphics, good sound, good acting, and so on.

239
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:06,985
You need to have solid bug-free code.

240
00:16:07,025 --> 00:16:10,067
You obviously don't want to frustrate your player by

241
00:16:10,127 --> 00:16:11,588
having their game crash all the time.

242
00:16:12,328 --> 00:16:14,750
An intuitive user interface that doesn't confuse them, one

243
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:15,731
that makes them interested.

244
00:16:17,032 --> 00:16:20,194
And makes it easy to understand and come back to.

245
00:16:21,034 --> 00:16:23,096
Lots and lots of well-placed marketing, obviously.

246
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,998
And a great license or tie-in.

247
00:16:26,038 --> 00:16:29,480
It's not an absolute necessity, but it's an important thing

248
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,601
to have some of the time.

249
00:16:31,881 --> 00:16:33,843
It's certainly a useful thing to have if you can afford it.

250
00:16:35,384 --> 00:16:38,766
Now, that's it.

251
00:16:41,148 --> 00:16:42,729
You know what I have to say about that list?

252
00:16:43,849 --> 00:16:44,310
Boring.

253
00:16:45,912 --> 00:16:48,013
Who cares? So what?

254
00:16:48,514 --> 00:16:50,395
If you've been in this industry more than six months,

255
00:16:50,415 --> 00:16:52,796
you've already got that list engraved on your soul.

256
00:16:52,816 --> 00:16:56,038
Nobody needs to tell you that.

257
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:58,999
You certainly don't need to have to pay $650 at a minimum

258
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:00,900
to come here and hear that list.

259
00:17:02,241 --> 00:17:04,562
Now, I want to talk about a lot more subtle issues.

260
00:17:05,223 --> 00:17:07,084
I want to talk about the things that we need to do

261
00:17:07,464 --> 00:17:08,924
after you've done the stuff on that list.

262
00:17:08,965 --> 00:17:10,685
You know you've got to do the stuff on that list.

263
00:17:11,526 --> 00:17:13,407
I want to talk about the sort of...

264
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:20,012
Second tier, the meta things that we need to think about when we're trying to create product development.

265
00:17:20,592 --> 00:17:27,636
And none of these issues that I'm going to bring up are either necessary or sufficient conditions for long-term success.

266
00:17:28,516 --> 00:17:31,378
What I'm going to describe here is not a set of laws or rules.

267
00:17:31,438 --> 00:17:34,379
Just follow them and all of a sudden you will have a long-term success.

268
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,580
That's not the way this kind of stuff works.

269
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,081
These are lessons, not laws.

270
00:17:38,582 --> 00:17:39,882
And lessons are never absolute.

271
00:17:40,302 --> 00:17:42,123
But I do believe that they lead in the right direction.

272
00:17:43,635 --> 00:17:52,242
And I want to start, hold on a minute, by talking about Batman.

273
00:17:53,783 --> 00:17:55,745
Now, if your experience of Batman

274
00:17:55,785 --> 00:17:58,367
chiefly comes from the 1960s-era television show,

275
00:17:58,387 --> 00:18:01,249
then I most earnestly beg you to forget it.

276
00:18:03,251 --> 00:18:05,112
Likewise, for that matter, the recent movies,

277
00:18:05,553 --> 00:18:07,194
I don't think the movies either capture

278
00:18:07,214 --> 00:18:08,355
the true spirit of Batman.

279
00:18:09,636 --> 00:18:12,478
No, I'm talking about the Batman of the DC Comics.

280
00:18:14,024 --> 00:18:19,806
Batman to me is much more interesting than all the other superheroes, for a couple of reasons.

281
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:23,968
First off, Batman is not, in fact, a superhero.

282
00:18:24,948 --> 00:18:28,409
He didn't come from any exploding planets, like Superman did.

283
00:18:28,969 --> 00:18:31,510
He didn't inhale any weird gases, like the Flash.

284
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,191
He wasn't bitten by any radioactive spiders.

285
00:18:34,471 --> 00:18:36,852
He didn't find a talking lantern, like the Green Lantern.

286
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:43,244
Batman is a normal man, and he has to solve his problems within a normal man's limitations.

287
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:49,672
Now admittedly, he is a very rich, and very smart, and very strong, and let's face it, very lucky man.

288
00:18:53,443 --> 00:18:56,645
But he is still basically just a man.

289
00:18:57,045 --> 00:18:59,126
And that, I think, makes him more interesting.

290
00:18:59,846 --> 00:19:03,508
And the second reason is that his motivations I find more interesting.

291
00:19:04,168 --> 00:19:07,930
Most other superheroes are motivated by a kind of a naive do-gooderism.

292
00:19:08,631 --> 00:19:11,092
Gee, I am endowed with superpowers. What shall I do?

293
00:19:11,112 --> 00:19:12,933
I shall fight crime.

294
00:19:12,953 --> 00:19:12,993
No.

295
00:19:15,994 --> 00:19:17,795
Batman's motivations are somewhat different.

296
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,557
He's not endowed with the superpowers.

297
00:19:21,437 --> 00:19:22,818
But when Bruce Wayne was a boy...

298
00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:27,181
He was walking home with his parents from the movies one night,

299
00:19:28,162 --> 00:19:33,385
and a man stepped out of an alley and shot his parents to death right in front of him and ran off.

300
00:19:34,906 --> 00:19:37,027
The memory of this event haunts Bruce Wayne.

301
00:19:37,788 --> 00:19:39,969
He has nightmares. He can't sleep.

302
00:19:40,629 --> 00:19:45,172
And so what he does instead is he gets on an outrageous costume and prowls around at night

303
00:19:45,472 --> 00:19:47,233
looking for other crimes to interfere with.

304
00:19:48,423 --> 00:19:54,805
Batman swore by the spirit of his parents to make war on all criminals shortly after their death.

305
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:58,967
Now that's interesting. He did not swear to fight crime.

306
00:19:59,727 --> 00:20:03,288
He did not swear to do good. He did not swear to seek justice.

307
00:20:03,608 --> 00:20:09,531
He swore to make war, which is a much more morally ambiguous vow.

308
00:20:12,992 --> 00:20:16,873
So Batman is motivated by an inner rage, an inner hatred.

309
00:20:18,479 --> 00:20:22,061
And we saw that in some of his early stories.

310
00:20:22,462 --> 00:20:25,344
And then in the 1950s, along came the Comics Code Authority.

311
00:20:25,884 --> 00:20:28,506
And the tales of Batman were sanitized for several decades.

312
00:20:28,546 --> 00:20:30,047
And his inner rage was suppressed.

313
00:20:30,627 --> 00:20:34,289
And he became just another kind of naive do-gooder superhero.

314
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:39,573
But in 1986, DC Comics took a very bold step.

315
00:20:40,493 --> 00:20:44,076
And they brought out a book called The Dark Knight Returns.

316
00:20:46,557 --> 00:20:47,238
And in this book,

317
00:20:47,944 --> 00:20:53,005
They chose to examine the question of what Batman's true nature really was

318
00:20:53,985 --> 00:20:57,346
and what it would really be like to have him in your town.

319
00:20:57,366 --> 00:20:59,826
Laughter

320
00:21:02,287 --> 00:21:05,628
And there's a scene in here that neatly summarizes Batman's character, I think.

321
00:21:07,028 --> 00:21:11,489
Batman is crouching in the shadows at the foot of some stairs behind his cape

322
00:21:11,829 --> 00:21:14,189
and a thug with a gun is coming down the stairs behind him.

323
00:21:14,969 --> 00:21:16,590
And we hear Batman's thoughts and...

324
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:22,271
voiceover narration in an almost chillingly detached tone, he says to us,

325
00:21:23,112 --> 00:21:25,094
there are seven working defenses from this position.

326
00:21:25,975 --> 00:21:28,238
Three of them disarm with minimal contact.

327
00:21:29,058 --> 00:21:29,819
Three of them kill.

328
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,061
One hurts.

329
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,147
And he whirls around and kicks the thug violently in the stomach.

330
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:39,329
Now observe here.

331
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:43,359
Batman had three opportunities to kill and he did not take any of them.

332
00:21:43,699 --> 00:21:47,402
He had three opportunities to disarm with minimal contact and he did not take any of them.

333
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:51,045
He had one opportunity to inflict pain and that's the one he chose.

334
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:57,390
That is the essence of Batman's real character.

335
00:22:00,332 --> 00:22:02,714
I don't think Batman does this stuff because he wants to.

336
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:09,944
I think Batman does this stuff because he has to, because he is driven, he is compelled,

337
00:22:10,224 --> 00:22:11,845
he is obsessed.

338
00:22:13,046 --> 00:22:16,989
And I think in some respects Batman has certain things in common with serial killers.

339
00:22:18,391 --> 00:22:24,655
Batman's violence is cathartic, it's orgasmic, it's almost masturbatory, it's what he does

340
00:22:24,695 --> 00:22:25,976
to help him get to sleep at night.

341
00:22:36,324 --> 00:22:40,187
In short, it's not about fighting crime, it's about beating the hell out of people.

342
00:22:41,348 --> 00:22:46,453
Bruce Wayne makes this morally palatable to himself by selecting victims that he's pretty

343
00:22:46,653 --> 00:22:47,654
sure deserve it.

344
00:22:50,356 --> 00:22:52,838
So in this book, the fundamental question is raised.

345
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:57,462
Is Batman a heroic, public-spirited citizen, or is he an out-of-control vigilante?

346
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:02,278
I mean, let's face it, the guy runs around beating up people that he thinks have done something wrong.

347
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:06,040
He doesn't answer to anyone. He is judge, jury, and executioner.

348
00:23:06,501 --> 00:23:11,764
He is not bound by any constitutional restrictions about things like privacy or probable cause.

349
00:23:12,404 --> 00:23:14,965
And he has the winking cooperation of the police department.

350
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:20,148
Gee, can't get a search warrant or a wiretap? That's okay. We'll ask Batman to do it for us.

351
00:23:24,031 --> 00:23:26,772
I think the reason he wears that mask is because he doesn't want to get sued.

352
00:23:29,612 --> 00:23:32,132
Is this really somebody we want running around our town?

353
00:23:32,172 --> 00:23:33,352
That's quite an interesting question.

354
00:23:34,193 --> 00:23:36,293
There's another scene in here that I think is really intriguing too.

355
00:23:36,313 --> 00:23:42,454
It's a scene where Commissioner Gordon, say it isn't so, is about to retire.

356
00:23:43,495 --> 00:23:46,135
And he's talking to the captain who's going to be his replacement.

357
00:23:47,835 --> 00:23:54,157
And the captain who's going to be his replacement has sworn to put out an arrest warrant for Batman as soon as she takes office.

358
00:23:55,317 --> 00:23:58,338
And she says to Commissioner Gordon, I don't see how you can support a vigilante.

359
00:23:58,358 --> 00:23:58,918
And Gordon says...

360
00:24:00,066 --> 00:24:02,747
I'm sure you've heard old fossils like me talk about Pearl Harbor.

361
00:24:02,767 --> 00:24:05,128
The fact is we mostly lie about it.

362
00:24:05,548 --> 00:24:08,809
We make it sound like we jumped up and went after the axis on the spot.

363
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,110
Hell, we were scared.

364
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:12,651
Rumors were flying.

365
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:14,652
We thought the Japanese had taken California.

366
00:24:15,132 --> 00:24:19,794
We didn't even have an army, so we were there lying in bed, pulling the sheets up over our heads.

367
00:24:20,634 --> 00:24:26,897
And there was Roosevelt on the radio, strong and sure, taking fear and turning it into a fighting spirit, and we got our army.

368
00:24:28,913 --> 00:24:36,277
A few years back I heard a news magazine with a lot of people and a lot of evidence that said that Roosevelt knew Pearl was going to be attacked and that he let it happen.

369
00:24:37,097 --> 00:24:39,298
It wasn't proven. Things like that never are.

370
00:24:39,639 --> 00:24:45,482
I couldn't stop thinking about how horrible that would be and how Pearl was what got us off our duffs in time to stop the Axis.

371
00:24:46,862 --> 00:24:49,764
A lot of innocent men died, but we won the war.

372
00:24:50,965 --> 00:24:55,487
It bounced back and forth in my head until I realized I couldn't judge it. It was too big.

373
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:57,768
He was too big.

374
00:24:58,993 --> 00:25:05,236
Since then, presidents have come and gone, each one seeming smaller, weaker, the best of them like faint echoes of Roosevelt.

375
00:25:06,936 --> 00:25:11,118
And Captain Yindell says, well, I don't see what this has to do with the vigilante.

376
00:25:12,358 --> 00:25:15,159
And Commissioner Gordon says, well, maybe you will.

377
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,161
I was rather curious. I was very intrigued by that interchange.

378
00:25:22,202 --> 00:25:27,183
And I began to wonder. I'm a guy with a philosophy major, so I do these sorts of things in my spare time.

379
00:25:30,582 --> 00:25:34,404
Are some people's souls simply too big?

380
00:25:34,424 --> 00:25:38,286
Or are their jobs or their situations too complex

381
00:25:39,186 --> 00:25:40,647
to render moral judgments about?

382
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:44,389
I don't think so. I think that way leads to tyranny.

383
00:25:45,209 --> 00:25:48,091
If we allowed for that, then every tin-pot dictator who came along

384
00:25:48,111 --> 00:25:50,032
would be claiming that the end justified the means

385
00:25:50,052 --> 00:25:51,792
and that his soul was too big to be judged.

386
00:25:53,033 --> 00:25:55,834
Now, the more I thought about it,

387
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,555
the more I realized that

388
00:25:58,414 --> 00:26:00,456
We are all complex beings.

389
00:26:00,776 --> 00:26:05,781
It's not that there are some people, like Batman and Franklin Delano Roosevelt,

390
00:26:06,402 --> 00:26:09,165
about whom it is difficult to render moral judgments,

391
00:26:09,245 --> 00:26:14,570
or that their situations make them immune from moral judgments.

392
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:18,894
The reality is that it is difficult to render moral judgments, period.

393
00:26:19,956 --> 00:26:21,918
And the more that is at stake, the harder it is.

394
00:26:22,899 --> 00:26:26,382
We are all as complex as Bruce Wayne.

395
00:26:26,962 --> 00:26:30,585
Not as troubled, maybe. Not as driven, but as complex.

396
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:31,906
Nobody is a saint.

397
00:26:32,486 --> 00:26:38,351
Even Mother Teresa, whom the media is fond of portraying as this little old lady who washes the feet of lepers and that kind of stuff,

398
00:26:39,332 --> 00:26:45,256
cannot possibly be a saint, because Mother Teresa, in reality, is a very, very effective administrator.

399
00:26:45,957 --> 00:26:49,099
And you don't get to be an effective administrator without being a hard-ass some of the time.

400
00:26:52,208 --> 00:27:01,191
And it is that truth about us all that makes for great literature and great movies and great works which stand the test of time.

401
00:27:02,672 --> 00:27:09,535
Batman is interesting because he is morally ambiguous and because there is a mythic quality to his background.

402
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:20,919
Wolverine is interesting because Persons Unknown gave him an adamantium skeleton against his will in a process that caused him great pain.

403
00:27:22,822 --> 00:27:27,606
I also find him interesting because he's only 5'3", and so I, you know, really have a lot of respect for that.

404
00:27:30,287 --> 00:27:35,611
Superman is boring because he showed up on Earth one day and simply did what his parents told him to.

405
00:27:38,433 --> 00:27:43,397
Captain America is boring because he drank a weird potion, and ta-da, he's Captain America. So what?

406
00:27:44,657 --> 00:27:47,720
Computer games and comics books present a morally simple world.

407
00:27:48,543 --> 00:27:53,766
And mainstream comic books present a trivial and artificial morality with no subtlety or depth.

408
00:27:54,766 --> 00:27:58,408
And The Dark Knight was one of the first mainstream comic books to break that tradition.

409
00:27:59,029 --> 00:28:01,650
They decided they were not going to submit it to the Comics Code Authority.

410
00:28:02,531 --> 00:28:04,992
And computer games present the same morally simple world.

411
00:28:05,412 --> 00:28:10,295
For example, in SimCity, if you tear down an old residential neighborhood

412
00:28:10,975 --> 00:28:13,297
that's not producing very much in the way of tax base,

413
00:28:14,077 --> 00:28:15,278
and you rezone it commercial,

414
00:28:16,134 --> 00:28:19,797
You don't have people demonstrating outside your office

415
00:28:19,857 --> 00:28:21,718
and saying that you're in the back pocket of big business.

416
00:28:23,019 --> 00:28:25,101
It just doesn't happen. You don't have to worry about it.

417
00:28:26,522 --> 00:28:29,364
So, it's this game context,

418
00:28:30,225 --> 00:28:33,067
this, what they, at Doonesbury called years ago,

419
00:28:33,568 --> 00:28:37,111
the thrill of victory slash agony of defeat dichotomy,

420
00:28:38,572 --> 00:28:40,193
that defines what is morally good.

421
00:28:41,474 --> 00:28:46,438
Basically, what appropriate behavior is, is the thing that gets you more points.

422
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,779
That which leads to more points is the right thing to do.

423
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:57,927
And I think that we need to rid ourselves of these simplistic moralities

424
00:28:58,367 --> 00:29:03,771
and create challenges for our players in which judgments are not easy.

425
00:29:04,772 --> 00:29:09,336
Comics Code Authority Comics do not continue to sell year after year after year

426
00:29:09,756 --> 00:29:10,717
the same one over and over.

427
00:29:11,646 --> 00:29:14,467
This book came out in 1986 and it is still in print.

428
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:17,667
It does continue to sell year after year after year.

429
00:29:17,687 --> 00:29:23,268
And I think the depth and the nature of its story and the recognition

430
00:29:24,169 --> 00:29:29,050
that Batman is not nearly as straightforward as the Comics Code Authority would like us to believe

431
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,970
is the reason that this product has lasted.

432
00:29:35,311 --> 00:29:37,912
I think we want to re-examine the game metaphor and ask ourselves

433
00:29:38,012 --> 00:29:39,852
if giving points is really what we want to do.

434
00:29:40,954 --> 00:29:43,897
Or perhaps we could give different kinds of points for different things.

435
00:29:44,197 --> 00:29:45,578
You remember the board game Careers?

436
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:49,402
In Careers, you could set up at the beginning of the game

437
00:29:49,882 --> 00:29:53,086
how much of different things you wanted to collect over the course of the game,

438
00:29:53,126 --> 00:29:54,107
love, money, or fame.

439
00:29:55,088 --> 00:29:56,769
And what you did is you played the game

440
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,631
and you tried to reach your own goals,

441
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,093
the goals that you had set up for yourself.

442
00:30:00,433 --> 00:30:02,115
Why don't we create more games like that?

443
00:30:04,657 --> 00:30:10,219
game that I think there's opportunity for more complex judgments in is Magic Carpet.

444
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,401
Now Magic Carpet seems like a great shooter and you just run around and blow the hell

445
00:30:13,441 --> 00:30:13,961
out of everything.

446
00:30:15,222 --> 00:30:22,266
And it's one of the, it's got a nice gimmick because unlike most games until recently,

447
00:30:22,646 --> 00:30:26,588
when you hit something it looks damaged in Magic Carpet.

448
00:30:26,608 --> 00:30:30,170
So if you shoot a fireball into the ground you get a burn patch and if you shoot a meteor

449
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,811
storm into the ground you get a very large burn patch and so on.

450
00:30:33,822 --> 00:30:37,943
And the object of the game is to collect mana, which resides in living things.

451
00:30:38,743 --> 00:30:44,325
So you run around and you collect up all the mana, and when you win the game, you get to the end and this sepulchral voice comes out and says,

452
00:30:44,685 --> 00:30:48,366
Congratulations, Master Wizard. The world is restored to equilibrium.

453
00:30:49,606 --> 00:30:53,848
Yeah, it's a burned mess, and you've slaughtered every living thing on it, but it's in equilibrium.

454
00:30:56,127 --> 00:31:00,368
You know, I think it would have been nice if Magic Carpet had had a socially responsible mode.

455
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:03,508
Now, I'm not saying that Magic Carpet should have been socially responsible,

456
00:31:04,049 --> 00:31:06,069
but I'd love to have been able to flip a switch that said,

457
00:31:06,089 --> 00:31:09,650
you know what, you get points deducted for causing a forest fire.

458
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:13,851
The manual tells you that you can cause forest fires,

459
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:16,152
and that will help you kill off the evil creatures,

460
00:31:16,852 --> 00:31:19,693
which is nice, but then you've got a burned forest at the end of it.

461
00:31:20,293 --> 00:31:24,554
So, you know, that's an example of the kind of thing where it would have been fun to have a mode in which...

462
00:31:25,744 --> 00:31:27,365
You had a more complicated decision to make.

463
00:31:27,405 --> 00:31:30,787
Gee, maybe I should restrict myself to lower energy weapons

464
00:31:30,827 --> 00:31:32,688
so I don't do quite so much environmental damage.

465
00:31:34,589 --> 00:31:38,772
Moral ambiguity, mythic themes, tough decisions.

466
00:31:39,793 --> 00:31:43,875
These are the sources of great lasting legends.

467
00:31:53,401 --> 00:31:53,881
In the beginning,

468
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,123
The universe was filled with undifferentiated matter,

469
00:31:58,924 --> 00:32:02,006
and all was chaos, which is chaos.

470
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:05,529
But in time, the matter formed patterns,

471
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,592
and became ordered, which is cosmos.

472
00:32:09,732 --> 00:32:12,635
And of cosmos was made Gaia, the Earth Mother.

473
00:32:13,175 --> 00:32:17,219
And Gaia labored, and she brought forth Uranus, first of the Titans.

474
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:21,522
And Gaia mated with Uranus, and gave birth to the rest of the Titans,

475
00:32:21,582 --> 00:32:22,903
and to Cronus, last of all.

476
00:32:23,964 --> 00:32:28,507
But Uranus was despotic, and Gaia encouraged the Titans to overthrow their father.

477
00:32:29,367 --> 00:32:33,550
And at last, Cronus unmanned his father and cast his genitals into the sea,

478
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:36,692
and Cronus took his place on the throne of the world.

479
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:40,814
Now Cronus married Rhea, and their children were the gods.

480
00:32:41,615 --> 00:32:45,277
But Cronus feared that his children would do to him what he had done to his father.

481
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:49,040
And so when each of his children were born, he ate them.

482
00:32:50,295 --> 00:32:51,816
and finally re-attricked Cronus.

483
00:32:52,476 --> 00:32:53,957
And when he was ready to eat Zeus,

484
00:32:54,537 --> 00:32:56,618
she gave him a stone to eat instead.

485
00:32:58,099 --> 00:33:00,380
And Zeus grew up and overthrew Cronus

486
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:04,522
and forced him to disgorge his brothers and sister gods,

487
00:33:04,742 --> 00:33:05,383
whom he had eaten.

488
00:33:07,924 --> 00:33:09,565
And he and his brother and sister gods

489
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:11,746
defeated the Titans, the elder gods,

490
00:33:12,226 --> 00:33:13,847
and they became the younger gods

491
00:33:14,227 --> 00:33:15,848
and established the realm of the Olympians.

492
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:20,960
But when Cronus threw the genitals of his father Uranus into the sea,

493
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,922
they impregnated Gaia, the Earth Mother,

494
00:33:24,282 --> 00:33:29,805
and she brought forth all the living things upon the earth and in the sea and in the air.

495
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:31,785
The Greeks.

496
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:44,372
So, on to J.R.R. Tolkien.

497
00:33:45,963 --> 00:33:49,445
Now to start with, I'm going to admit that I am a Tolkien fan.

498
00:33:51,186 --> 00:33:55,128
And I realize that this is tantamount to admitting that one attends Star Trek conventions,

499
00:33:57,749 --> 00:34:00,611
or plays Dungeons and Dragons or something like that, neither of which I do.

500
00:34:02,152 --> 00:34:04,593
So I'll also say that I have my eyes open about Tolkien.

501
00:34:05,173 --> 00:34:08,255
I realize that Tolkien is not great literature.

502
00:34:08,996 --> 00:34:13,718
The guy is not in the same league as D.H. Lawrence and Virginia Woolf and Jorge Luis Borges.

503
00:34:13,778 --> 00:34:15,259
It's just not that good a writing.

504
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,462
And Tolkien's characters are fairly two-dimensional.

505
00:34:19,342 --> 00:34:22,024
And his themes are not particularly morally complex.

506
00:34:22,444 --> 00:34:23,365
Ooh, good versus evil.

507
00:34:23,405 --> 00:34:24,065
There's a new idea.

508
00:34:24,085 --> 00:34:28,128
Now, you may ask, how can Tolkien be successful without

509
00:34:28,148 --> 00:34:29,529
the moral complexity that I was just

510
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:30,490
arguing for a minute ago?

511
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:33,151
And one of the things you will notice about this lecture is

512
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:34,672
that practically everything I say is going to be

513
00:34:34,732 --> 00:34:36,553
contradicted a minute later by something else that I say.

514
00:34:38,027 --> 00:34:43,777
To which I would respond, actually, moral complexity, as I pointed out earlier, is not a necessary or a sufficient condition.

515
00:34:43,817 --> 00:34:45,920
Tolkien has been successful without it.

516
00:34:46,401 --> 00:34:51,109
Nevertheless, I still think it is a valuable thing to bring to an entertainment product.

517
00:34:51,957 --> 00:34:56,058
I do believe that it's important, and in this genre in particular, I think moral complexity

518
00:34:56,098 --> 00:34:57,058
is too long neglected.

519
00:34:57,498 --> 00:34:59,659
But I've already made that argument, and I'm going on to Tolkien now.

520
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:03,299
So while I'm a fan, I do acknowledge the limitations of his work.

521
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:08,081
Nevertheless, the average fantasy novel lasts on the shelves a few weeks or a few months

522
00:35:08,141 --> 00:35:13,162
or however long it is, not very long, and Tolkien continues to sell and sell and sell

523
00:35:13,262 --> 00:35:13,802
and sell.

524
00:35:14,762 --> 00:35:16,243
And why?

525
00:35:16,703 --> 00:35:17,063
What is it?

526
00:35:17,603 --> 00:35:20,864
Well, I think there are some things that Tolkien did right, and I think there are things that

527
00:35:20,884 --> 00:35:21,464
we can learn from.

528
00:35:22,758 --> 00:35:26,521
First thing I want to talk about is how Tolkien handled sequels.

529
00:35:27,983 --> 00:35:30,865
If you read Tolkien's works in the order in which they were published,

530
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:34,088
The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, The Silmarillion,

531
00:35:34,889 --> 00:35:36,130
you notice something rather interesting.

532
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,774
The Hobbit is a completely self-contained work.

533
00:35:40,414 --> 00:35:42,496
All the plot lines are tied up at the end,

534
00:35:42,536 --> 00:35:44,998
all the major characters are dealt with, when it's done, it's done.

535
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,201
But it does contain some intriguing references.

536
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:55,172
There's a brief mention that the Elven King was descended from those long ago elves who never went to the land of Faerie in the West.

537
00:35:56,593 --> 00:36:02,034
And at one point, the wizard Gandalf leaves the expedition to go help the White Council, whoever they are,

538
00:36:02,574 --> 00:36:08,536
drive the Necromancer, whoever he is, out of his fortress in the fastness of Dol Guldur, wherever that is.

539
00:36:09,496 --> 00:36:13,357
We find out later that he was successful, but we don't find out very much more about it.

540
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:23,916
The Hobbit contains references to a more ancient past and to a wider world than are included within the story itself.

541
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:28,699
But it does not need them. The absence of further explanation does not detract from the story.

542
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:34,083
If you go on to The Lord of the Rings, you find out a bit more about the elves and those who went to the land of Farag in the West.

543
00:36:34,883 --> 00:36:37,966
You find out exactly who the Necromancer is and what's going on with him.

544
00:36:39,347 --> 00:36:41,548
But it contains still more intriguing references.

545
00:36:42,108 --> 00:36:44,530
There's a mention of the last alliance of elves and men.

546
00:36:45,381 --> 00:36:50,842
The drowning of Numenor, some people called the Valar, and it's never very clear what

547
00:36:50,862 --> 00:36:51,482
that's about either.

548
00:36:51,523 --> 00:36:55,564
And again, at the end of The Lord of the Rings, the story is completely tied up, everyone

549
00:36:55,624 --> 00:36:57,504
is dealt with, you don't have to know this stuff.

550
00:36:58,084 --> 00:36:59,324
But it piques your curiosity.

551
00:37:00,545 --> 00:37:03,005
Finally, you read The Silmarillion and it answers them all.

552
00:37:03,365 --> 00:37:09,687
Because The Silmarillion is the complete cosmology, theology, history, geography, and ancient

553
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,187
literature of Tolkien's universe.

554
00:37:12,985 --> 00:37:15,366
It brings this stuff to a close and answers all those questions.

555
00:37:16,486 --> 00:37:20,548
Another good example of this kind of thing is in Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea Trilogy,

556
00:37:21,028 --> 00:37:24,069
where each work is completely self-contained, tied up at the end,

557
00:37:24,389 --> 00:37:28,971
but contains references to a wider world and a more ancient time.

558
00:37:30,972 --> 00:37:35,873
By comparison, let's look at how the sequel to Star Wars was handled.

559
00:37:36,802 --> 00:37:44,467
When we saw Darth Vader regain control of his careening TIE bomber and go zooming off into the galaxy at the end,

560
00:37:45,567 --> 00:37:47,889
Lucas might just as well have put up big red letters that said,

561
00:37:47,949 --> 00:37:49,310
sequel coming, sequel coming.

562
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:54,052
You know, that part of the story wasn't wrapped up.

563
00:37:54,853 --> 00:37:56,254
We didn't know Darth Vader's fate.

564
00:37:56,274 --> 00:38:00,636
He was a major character, clearly, and he just somehow got away and we didn't find out what happened to him.

565
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:03,298
Now, that's not a problem with Star Wars.

566
00:38:03,318 --> 00:38:05,900
Star Wars was obviously very successful.

567
00:38:06,657 --> 00:38:10,179
Because it was plenty compelling, and we wanted to come back and find out about it anyway.

568
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:15,602
But with less compelling material, it will eventually start to anger your audience.

569
00:38:16,522 --> 00:38:20,345
Two examples of this are the River World series by Philip José Farmer,

570
00:38:21,085 --> 00:38:23,966
which just seemed to go on and on and on,

571
00:38:24,086 --> 00:38:27,768
and you wondered if he was ever going to explain what the hell was going on.

572
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:32,231
And another example was Twin Peaks.

573
00:38:36,101 --> 00:38:38,808
And I began to wonder if David Lynch was laughing at us, you know?

574
00:38:38,828 --> 00:38:43,019
Ah, got them, sucker! I can get them watching surrealist nonsense for years!

575
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:50,753
Now it's not that big a deal with television where all you have to do is tune in once a week and it's free, more or less.

576
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:57,517
It's not that big a deal with books and movies where you have to go down to the bookstore or the movie theater and plunk down another $5.95.

577
00:38:57,977 --> 00:39:02,179
It's a little bit different with computer games where you have to go down to the computer store and plunk down $59.50.

578
00:39:02,419 --> 00:39:08,003
Ten times as much. When I get to the end of a computer game, I expect it to be the end.

579
00:39:08,363 --> 00:39:12,385
I do not expect to get to the end and find out that I'm going to have to go plunk down another $60 for the next...

580
00:39:13,946 --> 00:39:16,849
A game in a series that's going to last God knows how long.

581
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:22,994
So the first lesson from Tolkien is, make them want to come back,

582
00:39:24,015 --> 00:39:26,397
rather than make them have to come back.

583
00:39:27,017 --> 00:39:32,221
You cannot create product longevity simply by stringing your audience along.

584
00:39:33,042 --> 00:39:34,163
And Tolkien did not do that.

585
00:39:36,385 --> 00:39:39,808
The next interesting thing about Tolkien is that...

586
00:39:40,898 --> 00:39:45,220
While his books were published in the order of The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, The Silmarillion,

587
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,721
not counting some smaller works of poetry in between,

588
00:39:48,901 --> 00:39:51,343
The Silmarillion was actually written first.

589
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:56,605
And as I said, it's the complete cosmology, theology, geography, and history of his universe.

590
00:39:58,546 --> 00:40:00,587
And Tolkien took it to the publishers and they said,

591
00:40:01,027 --> 00:40:05,249
Gee, the legends of a non-existent place...

592
00:40:06,213 --> 00:40:12,277
containing no sex, almost no dialogue, written in a quasi-biblical language.

593
00:40:12,878 --> 00:40:15,219
Oh yeah, this is just gonna fly off the shelves.

594
00:40:20,642 --> 00:40:21,923
So, it was published last.

595
00:40:23,924 --> 00:40:28,647
But, because it was written first, Tolkien's work is incredibly self-consistent.

596
00:40:29,908 --> 00:40:31,309
Between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings...

597
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,103
And all his other stuff, it really feels very much like it's part of a whole

598
00:40:36,443 --> 00:40:39,025
that Tolkien had completely envisioned from start to finish.

599
00:40:39,845 --> 00:40:41,186
The world feels complete.

600
00:40:43,068 --> 00:40:45,509
As an example of a world that to me does not feel complete,

601
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:48,131
and again this is an example of something which has been a success,

602
00:40:48,171 --> 00:40:51,734
but I think it's been a success in spite of this rather than because of it,

603
00:40:53,115 --> 00:40:54,256
that's the world of Star Trek.

604
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:59,044
I don't have a very clear picture of what's going on in the world of Star Trek.

605
00:40:59,425 --> 00:41:00,767
I don't understand its politics.

606
00:41:00,847 --> 00:41:04,311
I don't understand how the Federation works or who's really in charge at Starfleet Command

607
00:41:04,651 --> 00:41:06,814
or whether they actually have any money or don't have any money.

608
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:18,185
And, you know, there's been a lot of work afterwards trying to go back and make it consistent.

609
00:41:18,405 --> 00:41:25,310
And another example of people who do that absolutely all the time, to the point of excess in my opinion, is Sherlock Holmes.

610
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:28,533
The Sherlock Holmes stories were dashed off very, very quickly.

611
00:41:28,593 --> 00:41:32,436
Conan Doyle was not particularly interested in creating a complete and unified world.

612
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:34,037
And they're horribly inconsistent.

613
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:38,260
It's not clear whether Dr. Watson received his injury in his shoulder or his leg.

614
00:41:39,161 --> 00:41:43,103
And a lot of people spend a lot of time trying to make up explanations for why they're so inconsistent.

615
00:41:44,124 --> 00:41:48,607
But I know how the Star Trek world problem came about, because the series was being developed under pressure,

616
00:41:48,647 --> 00:41:52,630
they were creating a television series, they had to crank out the things week after week after week.

617
00:41:54,091 --> 00:41:59,955
But, let's face it, there's a problem. I mean, an example that has become a standing joke is Kirk and the Prime Directive.

618
00:42:01,794 --> 00:42:03,635
Kirk's always breaking the Prime Directive.

619
00:42:04,256 --> 00:42:07,459
You know, sometimes on flimsy excuses, sometimes on no excuse at all.

620
00:42:07,779 --> 00:42:09,620
Now, I approve of Roddenberry's instinct here.

621
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,162
I mean, America was in the middle of the Vietnam War,

622
00:42:12,202 --> 00:42:14,284
and he wanted to make a comment about imperialism

623
00:42:14,624 --> 00:42:18,547
at a time when you absolutely did not talk about such things on prime-time television,

624
00:42:19,108 --> 00:42:20,969
and I think it was gutsy of him to do so.

625
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:24,292
But they wrote in the Prime Directive without really having thought through

626
00:42:24,352 --> 00:42:26,714
what the implications were going to be for the rest of the series.

627
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:30,847
And so, you know, as a result, we have this.

628
00:42:31,548 --> 00:42:36,131
The Prime Directive does not really feel like one of the great moral imperatives of the Federation,

629
00:42:36,171 --> 00:42:37,712
despite the fact that they always claim it is.

630
00:42:39,814 --> 00:42:43,917
Babylon 5, on the other hand, is a world that does, to me at least, feel complete.

631
00:42:44,777 --> 00:42:47,439
You just get the sense that Straczynski has thought it all out.

632
00:42:47,499 --> 00:42:49,000
Now, he's told us he's thought it all out,

633
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,641
but it feels as if he probably has.

634
00:42:51,681 --> 00:42:56,624
And I think, in time, people will come to think that Babylon 5 is a better series than Star Trek.

635
00:42:57,244 --> 00:42:59,946
God help me if you start getting into an argument about that here and now, but...

636
00:43:02,287 --> 00:43:04,809
That's my opinion in any case, and since I have the microphone.

637
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:09,311
So, the second lesson from Tolkien is,

638
00:43:09,471 --> 00:43:14,214
if you are planning and intending deliberately to create a product with a long lifespan...

639
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:19,902
then I strongly urge you to create your world ahead of time, as Tolkien did.

640
00:43:20,283 --> 00:43:22,804
Now, sometimes you don't have that option, as with Star Trek.

641
00:43:24,005 --> 00:43:27,767
Another example of a place where that happened is with the Electronic Arts Strike series.

642
00:43:28,888 --> 00:43:32,670
Desert Strike was a big success, and so they went on to create Jungle Strike, and it was a big success,

643
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,831
and so they went on to create Urban Strike, and it was a big success,

644
00:43:35,171 --> 00:43:36,632
and so they went on to create Soviet Strike.

645
00:43:37,293 --> 00:43:41,715
And, you know, they've been scrambling to build this world just as quickly as they could as they went on.

646
00:43:42,576 --> 00:43:46,638
But sometimes you can sort of get caught by your success and not have time to do it.

647
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:51,941
But if you're planning from the beginning to create a world that you want to last,

648
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:53,142
then try to do it ahead of time.

649
00:43:53,442 --> 00:43:57,525
At least try to do it before you bring out the first sequel to the first product.

650
00:43:59,066 --> 00:44:02,848
Now for the third lesson, I want to talk a little bit about my experience of reading Tolkien's works.

651
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:06,991
When I got to the end of The Silmarillion,

652
00:44:07,971 --> 00:44:09,172
I thought, okay, that's all there is.

653
00:44:09,192 --> 00:44:10,653
You know, I've read the geography and the history.

654
00:44:11,253 --> 00:44:13,815
But then I was sort of intrigued by Wagner's ring cycle.

655
00:44:13,895 --> 00:44:18,518
It also seemed to be about dwarves and dragons and magic rings that rule the world.

656
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:23,982
And I found out that Wagner was loosely based on Old Norse and Germanic and Icelandic legends.

657
00:44:24,042 --> 00:44:25,423
And I started to get interested in them.

658
00:44:25,463 --> 00:44:29,486
And I got interested in Beowulf and Anglo-Saxon poetry and that kind of stuff.

659
00:44:30,507 --> 00:44:32,908
And all of a sudden, I came across this word, orc.

660
00:44:33,966 --> 00:44:37,848
Now I was absolutely sure that Tolkien, like all other fantasy writers, had just made this

661
00:44:37,928 --> 00:44:38,288
word up.

662
00:44:38,608 --> 00:44:42,871
You know, that it was just this kind of nonsense word that he conjured out of the air and put

663
00:44:42,891 --> 00:44:43,531
down on paper.

664
00:44:44,631 --> 00:44:49,034
And I shouldn't say all other fantasy writers, but that does seem to be common, that a lot

665
00:44:49,054 --> 00:44:51,655
of fantasy just seems to be full of sort of gibberish that people have made up.

666
00:44:52,235 --> 00:44:53,016
And Tolkien hadn't.

667
00:44:53,196 --> 00:44:55,597
Orc is in fact the old Anglo-Saxon word for demon.

668
00:44:56,685 --> 00:45:01,048
And the name Bjorn, which was a character in a Tolkien work,

669
00:45:01,328 --> 00:45:03,489
who was a man who could turn himself into a bear at night,

670
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:06,071
that is, in fact, the Anglo-Saxon word for bear.

671
00:45:06,712 --> 00:45:07,212
And so on.

672
00:45:07,232 --> 00:45:08,113
There's quite a lot of these.

673
00:45:08,513 --> 00:45:10,454
And the names of all the dwarves are taken right out

674
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:11,555
of the Icelandic sagas.

675
00:45:12,275 --> 00:45:15,137
And I began to realize, bearing in mind that I was young,

676
00:45:16,058 --> 00:45:18,780
that Tolkien's work is based on an enormous body

677
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:19,860
of earlier work.

678
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:20,941
And all this stuff that I thought

679
00:45:20,961 --> 00:45:23,243
he just made up out of his own head, all those names

680
00:45:23,283 --> 00:45:26,065
and all the rest of that stuff were, in fact, only borrowed.

681
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:30,869
Tolkien's works are not works of pure imagination.

682
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:35,012
And I talked about this a little bit last year, but I want to go into it some more this year.

683
00:45:35,792 --> 00:45:41,476
Now, as creative people, we prefer, I think, to create works of pure imagination.

684
00:45:42,236 --> 00:45:45,258
We want to express our own creativity and ideas.

685
00:45:46,099 --> 00:45:48,520
Imagine that you're an art student. Which would you rather do?

686
00:45:49,417 --> 00:45:52,758
You know, they plunk down a vase in front of you with some irises in it,

687
00:45:53,438 --> 00:45:55,959
and they say, I want you to paint this in the style of Van Gogh.

688
00:45:55,979 --> 00:45:58,219
I want you to paint it so that it looks like Van Gogh painted it.

689
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,360
Would you rather do that, or would you rather paint it in your own style?

690
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,221
Would you rather compose music in your style,

691
00:46:05,961 --> 00:46:08,982
or would you rather be told that you have to compose it in Mozart's style?

692
00:46:09,882 --> 00:46:12,083
Would you rather create computer games in your style,

693
00:46:12,643 --> 00:46:15,123
or would you rather create computer games in Chris Crawford's style?

694
00:46:15,894 --> 00:46:20,756
I mean, we don't really like being told that we have to do things in someone else's style.

695
00:46:21,977 --> 00:46:28,819
And I think works of pure imagination to us somehow seem sort of more honest, more personal.

696
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:34,742
If a friend comes to us with a painting and they say, look, I painted this painting, that's one thing.

697
00:46:35,402 --> 00:46:39,043
If they say, look, I made a copy of Van Gogh's painting, that's another thing.

698
00:46:39,744 --> 00:46:41,624
It feels more honest somehow.

699
00:46:41,664 --> 00:46:45,506
It gives more credit and more attention to work that is entirely someone's own.

700
00:46:45,925 --> 00:46:48,347
than work which is a copy or in someone else's style.

701
00:46:49,127 --> 00:46:50,868
And what was one of the slogans of the 60s?

702
00:46:50,928 --> 00:46:52,089
Do your own thing, right?

703
00:46:52,629 --> 00:46:54,110
About one of the nastiest things you

704
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:56,532
can say about a creative work is that it's derivative.

705
00:46:58,533 --> 00:47:00,854
But as I began to think about this and think about Tolkien

706
00:47:01,275 --> 00:47:04,497
and what he had done, I began to wonder if that attitude is

707
00:47:04,537 --> 00:47:05,297
really appropriate.

708
00:47:05,317 --> 00:47:07,879
The thing about pure imagination is

709
00:47:07,919 --> 00:47:09,940
that it's fairly easy to do rapidly,

710
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:12,301
but it's not easy to do well.

711
00:47:14,116 --> 00:47:18,178
Works of pure imagination do not require any study of existing work.

712
00:47:18,678 --> 00:47:21,019
They do not require any knowledge of culture history.

713
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,181
When you're creating a work of pure imagination, you don't have to know anything.

714
00:47:25,241 --> 00:47:26,822
It just all comes out of your own head.

715
00:47:27,763 --> 00:47:31,564
And I think this is why much of modern art, like abstract expressionism,

716
00:47:31,604 --> 00:47:34,726
leaves people cold, because it has no cultural roots.

717
00:47:35,426 --> 00:47:36,907
It doesn't have any frame of reference.

718
00:47:37,527 --> 00:47:39,588
It doesn't reach out and touch the viewer's soul.

719
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:44,612
Most works of pure imagination that are done rapidly are about one inch deep.

720
00:47:45,173 --> 00:47:47,815
And that applies to computer games, which are made in one or two years.

721
00:47:48,175 --> 00:47:53,138
We simply don't have the time to devote to works of pure imagination than they require.

722
00:47:53,479 --> 00:47:56,801
By contrast, Tolkien's works, which are not works of pure imagination,

723
00:47:57,302 --> 00:48:01,925
still took most of a lifetime to create to the level of depth that it has.

724
00:48:03,826 --> 00:48:05,027
In an analogy to building.

725
00:48:05,892 --> 00:48:09,935
A work of pure imagination is like a column standing by itself.

726
00:48:10,496 --> 00:48:12,918
It's held up only by its own inner strength.

727
00:48:12,998 --> 00:48:16,141
It has no other support, and it's fairly easy to knock down.

728
00:48:17,402 --> 00:48:22,547
A work of derived imagination is a bit like the block at the top of a pyramid.

729
00:48:23,427 --> 00:48:26,050
Tolkien's works are like the block at the top of a giant pyramid.

730
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:29,813
The top is what everyone wants to see. The top is where everyone wants to go.

731
00:48:29,893 --> 00:48:32,676
You get there, and the first thing you do is climb up to the top and look around.

732
00:48:33,293 --> 00:48:37,215
But after you've looked at it, you begin to realize that it rests on an enormous foundation.

733
00:48:38,335 --> 00:48:42,877
And you start to ask yourself if maybe there isn't something inside.

734
00:48:44,297 --> 00:48:48,538
Too many computer games, I think, are works of pure imagination.

735
00:48:49,078 --> 00:48:52,319
They're all done in one or two years. They're all one or two inches deep.

736
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,700
They don't reach in and touch anyone's soul.

737
00:48:56,181 --> 00:48:58,802
As Isaac Newton said, if I have seen farther,

738
00:48:59,762 --> 00:49:02,603
it was by standing on the shoulders of giants.

739
00:49:03,676 --> 00:49:09,878
The third lesson from Tolkien is borrow, steal, rip off, plagiarize, whatever.

740
00:49:11,219 --> 00:49:14,000
We need to stop trying to make it all up ourselves.

741
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,581
We need to learn to draw on other resources.

742
00:49:16,861 --> 00:49:19,742
We need to acknowledge that we are not giants.

743
00:49:20,862 --> 00:49:24,984
Go out there and look for other stuff, and you will have a longer-lived product.

744
00:49:38,178 --> 00:49:43,706
In the beginning, there was nothing but endless space and Tawa, the sun spirit.

745
00:49:44,488 --> 00:49:47,052
And Tawa took of his own essence and he made the first world.

746
00:49:47,813 --> 00:49:49,796
But the people of the first world were all insects.

747
00:49:50,504 --> 00:49:52,425
who lived in caves and fought among themselves.

748
00:49:52,465 --> 00:49:56,066
And Tawa was displeased, and he sent the spider grandmother to them,

749
00:49:56,406 --> 00:49:58,147
who led them up to the second world.

750
00:49:58,767 --> 00:50:00,107
And when they arrived at the second world,

751
00:50:00,407 --> 00:50:03,248
the people were transformed into wolves and dogs and bears.

752
00:50:03,808 --> 00:50:05,249
And still they fought among themselves,

753
00:50:05,549 --> 00:50:07,089
and did not understand the meaning of life.

754
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:09,630
And Tawa again sent the spider grandmother,

755
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:11,611
and she led them up to the third world.

756
00:50:12,732 --> 00:50:15,654
And when they arrived at the third world, they were transformed into human beings.

757
00:50:16,254 --> 00:50:20,017
And Spider Grandmother taught them to weave and to plant corn and to make pots,

758
00:50:20,077 --> 00:50:21,438
and she bade them to be virtuous.

759
00:50:22,399 --> 00:50:25,882
But the third world was cold, and the corn did not grow well,

760
00:50:26,362 --> 00:50:27,643
and they could not fire the pots.

761
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:30,765
And then came Hummingbird, bearing the bow drill,

762
00:50:31,386 --> 00:50:33,508
a gift from Masawu, the Lord of Fire.

763
00:50:33,968 --> 00:50:36,990
And Hummingbird told them that there was an upper world above the sky.

764
00:50:37,911 --> 00:50:41,033
So the people began to cook their meat and to make fired pottery.

765
00:50:41,632 --> 00:50:45,714
But they became lazy and began to gamble and to turn their faces away from virtue.

766
00:50:46,475 --> 00:50:51,318
And finally, Spider Grandmother came again, and she led the people up the inside of a bamboo pole

767
00:50:51,738 --> 00:50:55,200
to the fourth world, the upper world beneath the open sky,

768
00:50:55,660 --> 00:51:00,242
which is our world, near to the sacred San Francisco peaks, where the kachinas live.

769
00:51:01,383 --> 00:51:04,145
Now, the fourth world is our world, and there is much work to be done here.

770
00:51:04,505 --> 00:51:07,587
But at the bottom of every kiva, there is the sipapu,

771
00:51:08,307 --> 00:51:10,928
the sacred hole which leads down to the third world.

772
00:51:11,423 --> 00:51:14,524
And which is the reminder of our journeys with the spider

773
00:51:14,544 --> 00:51:17,385
grandmother, the Hopis.

774
00:51:22,867 --> 00:51:29,349
If you go to Oxford University, near Oxford there is a little

775
00:51:29,409 --> 00:51:33,191
pub called The Eagle and Child, better known to its

776
00:51:33,371 --> 00:51:34,731
denizens as The Bird and Baby.

777
00:51:35,732 --> 00:51:38,893
And there's a small room in the back where Tolkien and a

778
00:51:38,953 --> 00:51:40,933
number of his literary and academic friends.

779
00:51:42,378 --> 00:51:46,661
C.S. Lewis and so on, used to get together regularly and they'd read aloud to each other

780
00:51:46,721 --> 00:51:48,342
from the stuff that they'd been working on.

781
00:51:48,662 --> 00:51:49,963
They called themselves the Inklings.

782
00:51:51,724 --> 00:51:55,207
And there was one man, I don't know who it was, it wasn't C.S. Lewis, I know that,

783
00:51:56,087 --> 00:52:00,651
who whenever Tolkien would pull out his manuscript, he used to put his hand over his face and

784
00:52:00,691 --> 00:52:04,033
say, oh God, not more elves.

785
00:52:08,316 --> 00:52:10,598
Well, I know how he feels.

786
00:52:12,021 --> 00:52:16,244
We are inundated with elves and dwarves and dragons.

787
00:52:17,324 --> 00:52:21,767
Now those of you who are descended from Anglo-Saxon and Germanic and Teutonic stock may object,

788
00:52:21,807 --> 00:52:23,508
well, that's my cultural heritage, you know?

789
00:52:23,948 --> 00:52:28,271
I mean, why is Tolkien the only guy that gets to have the block on top of that particular pyramid?

790
00:52:29,291 --> 00:52:36,015
And, you know, I would say, no, you can be on top of that pyramid as well if you want to.

791
00:52:36,055 --> 00:52:39,678
You're free to put out yet another elf-dwarf-dragon game, that's fine.

792
00:52:40,489 --> 00:52:44,354
But what the hell are you going to do to differentiate yourself from all the other elf-dwarf-dragon games?

793
00:52:45,796 --> 00:52:49,720
I'm not arguing for multiculturalism here for its own sake, okay?

794
00:52:50,101 --> 00:52:55,407
I'm not arguing for multiculturalism here because it's right, or socially responsible, or politically correct.

795
00:52:55,488 --> 00:52:59,132
God knows we're not in the business of trying to broaden anyone's mind in this industry.

796
00:53:04,828 --> 00:53:08,190
No, I'm arguing for multiculturalism out of pure self-interest.

797
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:11,371
The market is saturated with elves and dwarves.

798
00:53:11,491 --> 00:53:14,353
Why not be a little bit different? Look for something else.

799
00:53:15,613 --> 00:53:19,135
Look at Magic Carpet, Aladdin, Prince of Persia.

800
00:53:20,095 --> 00:53:22,737
All these are hit games and they're all drawn from a culture

801
00:53:22,757 --> 00:53:25,298
that Americans regard with hostility and suspicion.

802
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:29,640
I have here two great science fiction novels.

803
00:53:30,361 --> 00:53:33,382
Both of these are winners both of the Hugo and the Nebula Awards.

804
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:35,832
One is Dune.

805
00:53:36,872 --> 00:53:39,194
The culture is derived from the Bedouin Arabs.

806
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:43,617
One of them is Lord of Light by Roger Zelazny.

807
00:53:44,077 --> 00:53:46,238
The culture is derived from Hindu mythology.

808
00:53:47,299 --> 00:53:49,780
Both of these games won both the Hugo and Nebula awards.

809
00:53:51,542 --> 00:53:53,983
Both of them are towering masterpieces of imagination.

810
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:55,604
Both of them are still in print.

811
00:53:56,925 --> 00:54:02,609
But would they have won if they had been about elves and dwarves yet again?

812
00:54:03,049 --> 00:54:04,250
I think probably not.

813
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:10,597
I think the reason they won is partly due to the fact that they're about something else.

814
00:54:11,297 --> 00:54:12,558
And I think we should consider that.

815
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:19,580
Most recently, I've become addicted to a game called Marble Drop, which just came out from Maxis,

816
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:23,162
which is about dropping a marble down through a sort of a series of puzzles to...

817
00:54:23,582 --> 00:54:26,283
and you have to try and figure out where it's going to go and get it to go in the right place.

818
00:54:26,683 --> 00:54:28,584
And that's... that's...

819
00:54:30,432 --> 00:54:31,992
It's a great game, I'm having a lot of fun with it.

820
00:54:32,372 --> 00:54:34,253
But the background, behind everything else,

821
00:54:34,833 --> 00:54:38,394
are notebooks which look like the pages of Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks.

822
00:54:39,074 --> 00:54:41,815
And I find that very charming, and I really appreciate that they

823
00:54:43,035 --> 00:54:46,676
went to the trouble to do that. Now, Leonardo da Vinci is yet another dead white male,

824
00:54:46,696 --> 00:54:47,937
and I'm sure there are people who would say,

825
00:54:47,977 --> 00:54:50,297
no, no, no, we should shove them aside entirely.

826
00:54:51,938 --> 00:54:54,139
But nevertheless, at least it's not a dwarf!

827
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:57,820
So.

828
00:54:59,007 --> 00:55:00,107
How are you going to find this stuff?

829
00:55:00,207 --> 00:55:02,589
Okay, I've told you no more L's for God's sake.

830
00:55:02,609 --> 00:55:03,289
Go do something else.

831
00:55:03,309 --> 00:55:04,230
How are you going to find it?

832
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:05,531
Well, there's a gimmick.

833
00:55:05,991 --> 00:55:07,192
Some of you have got it, some of you don't.

834
00:55:07,232 --> 00:55:08,533
I'm very interested to see this now.

835
00:55:08,793 --> 00:55:11,895
You've been sitting for a while, so what I'd like you to do is reach in and get your wallets out.

836
00:55:12,696 --> 00:55:14,297
Okay, get out your wallets, purses, whatever.

837
00:55:14,317 --> 00:55:18,519
We're going to look through here because I'm hoping that a bunch of you have the thing in here that you need.

838
00:55:20,241 --> 00:55:20,601
Okay?

839
00:55:21,381 --> 00:55:22,542
We are not looking for the money.

840
00:55:23,693 --> 00:55:25,414
We know you need the money, okay?

841
00:55:25,954 --> 00:55:27,575
We're not looking for the credit cards.

842
00:55:27,595 --> 00:55:29,095
We're not looking for the AAA card.

843
00:55:29,456 --> 00:55:31,336
We're not even looking for the CGDA card,

844
00:55:31,356 --> 00:55:32,677
which of course you all have.

845
00:55:34,257 --> 00:55:36,358
We are looking for, somebody over there got it right,

846
00:55:36,398 --> 00:55:38,139
your library card.

847
00:55:38,859 --> 00:55:41,100
Who's got them? Hold them up. Come on, come on, let's see, let's see.

848
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,101
Who's got a library card?

849
00:55:48,042 --> 00:55:48,943
That is pathetic!

850
00:55:53,177 --> 00:55:55,359
Those few of you can pat yourselves on the back.

851
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:56,460
The rest of you...

852
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:03,046
How in the hell do you think you can possibly work in a creative industry without access to a library?

853
00:56:03,846 --> 00:56:07,369
You know what one of the very first things George Lucas did with his money from Star Wars?

854
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:11,913
He went out and he built a beautiful library and he filled it full of wonderful books

855
00:56:12,153 --> 00:56:17,138
because he knew that a creative business was going to require access to a great library.

856
00:56:17,418 --> 00:56:19,439
It is not all on the web.

857
00:56:28,314 --> 00:56:30,056
Web is wonderful, don't get me wrong.

858
00:56:30,496 --> 00:56:35,841
I looked up some important stuff about 24 hours ago on those terminals outside that I needed for this lecture.

859
00:56:36,741 --> 00:56:40,585
But, it is far from complete and it is very badly organized.

860
00:56:41,485 --> 00:56:43,927
It's great for reference, it's a terrible teaching tool.

861
00:56:44,188 --> 00:56:46,209
You can't really learn anything systematic.

862
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:51,534
And if you really want to learn something new and use that to create a product that's going to last,

863
00:56:51,814 --> 00:56:53,796
you're going to have to do some systematic learning.

864
00:56:54,826 --> 00:56:58,027
So the second thing you've got to do with that library card is you have got to use it.

865
00:56:58,927 --> 00:57:02,688
You do not make brilliant, wonderful, long-lived products

866
00:57:02,808 --> 00:57:07,610
by keeping your nose so close to the grindstone all the time that your work is out of focus.

867
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:12,151
You've got to take time off to study and to learn and to think.

868
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:14,932
And what that means is you've got to take off half a day a week,

869
00:57:15,632 --> 00:57:17,112
which in this industry means six hours,

870
00:57:19,933 --> 00:57:21,033
and tell your boss

871
00:57:22,788 --> 00:57:25,512
During that time, the video's not going to get compressed,

872
00:57:25,933 --> 00:57:27,436
and the code's not going to get written,

873
00:57:27,756 --> 00:57:31,282
and the design, and the music, and the ad copy, and all the rest of it are not going to get made

874
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:33,265
because you are going to go down to the library,

875
00:57:33,506 --> 00:57:36,531
and you are going to sit in a comfortable chair, and you are going to learn something.

876
00:57:38,338 --> 00:57:45,061
If you are doing a football game, go read about Newt Rockne and Vince Lombardi and modern past defenses.

877
00:57:45,442 --> 00:57:50,104
If you are doing a flight simulator, go down to the library and read Jane's Defense Weekly and All the World's Aircraft.

878
00:57:50,484 --> 00:57:59,189
If, God help us, you are doing an Elves and Dwarves game, then go down and read the Icelandic sagas or at least something other than Tolkien.

879
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:05,011
In the course of this lecture, I have read to you...

880
00:58:05,623 --> 00:58:08,364
Four of the world's great creation myths.

881
00:58:09,545 --> 00:58:12,726
I would guess, and I may be underestimating you,

882
00:58:13,127 --> 00:58:15,808
that most of you had only heard one or two of them when you came in here.

883
00:58:16,989 --> 00:58:22,632
There are, at a rough estimate, 160 living religions in the world.

884
00:58:23,112 --> 00:58:25,933
And that does not count the ones that died out like the ancient Egyptians.

885
00:58:27,074 --> 00:58:28,254
A religion is a mythos.

886
00:58:29,187 --> 00:58:33,951
It is a psychological and linguistic and philosophical and cultural structure

887
00:58:34,651 --> 00:58:37,354
which attracts and holds people's souls.

888
00:58:38,295 --> 00:58:45,001
There are 160 sources of myth, of legend, of stories that have touched people deeply.

889
00:58:46,142 --> 00:58:47,583
I've told you about just four.

890
00:58:48,283 --> 00:58:49,585
It's all there for the taking.

891
00:58:50,862 --> 00:58:52,403
So I set you a creative challenge.

892
00:58:53,024 --> 00:58:56,188
When you leave here, go back to your work

893
00:58:56,488 --> 00:58:58,651
and look for its mythic foundations.

894
00:58:58,951 --> 00:59:00,873
And if you don't find any, then start to dig.

895
00:59:01,734 --> 00:59:05,419
Go out to the library and try to find some mythic material

896
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:06,279
to work with.

897
00:59:07,321 --> 00:59:07,921
Do some learning.

898
00:59:08,968 --> 00:59:11,710
Now for you hard-headed materialists out there, and I know there are a few,

899
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:16,872
I would point out to you that Oral Roberts and Reverend Moon and Bhagwan Shri Rajneesh

900
00:59:17,212 --> 00:59:21,034
have all clearly demonstrated that when you have someone's soul, their money will soon follow.

901
00:59:21,854 --> 00:59:23,035
Laughter and applause

902
00:59:28,177 --> 00:59:29,518
You want to make a product that lasts?

903
00:59:30,819 --> 00:59:34,080
Then find a way to touch your player's soul.

904
00:59:35,101 --> 00:59:38,122
Stop thinking of him or her as a customer.

905
00:59:38,955 --> 00:59:41,582
Start thinking of him or her as a convert.

906
00:59:42,945 --> 00:59:44,068
Here endeth the lesson.
