1
00:00:06,167 --> 00:00:06,827
Yeah, are we good?

2
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:08,709
Cool.

3
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:13,633
OK, so I thought I'd prepare for this talk as much as possible.

4
00:00:13,673 --> 00:00:16,115
So I got it all done a few days early,

5
00:00:16,395 --> 00:00:18,297
and I left my power cord at home.

6
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:21,159
So I borrowed a laptop so things might go wrong.

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:22,140
Let's just see.

8
00:00:23,922 --> 00:00:26,063
So yes, my name is Tameem Mansoonyadis.

9
00:00:26,123 --> 00:00:28,485
I'm the creative director at Ninja Theory.

10
00:00:29,286 --> 00:00:31,488
And one year ago in Cologne.

11
00:00:33,671 --> 00:00:39,752
I did a talk called the Independent AAA Proposition, which was a theory of a new model of development

12
00:00:39,852 --> 00:00:41,253
that we wanted to try out.

13
00:00:41,673 --> 00:00:44,213
I don't know if any of you guys were here for that talk.

14
00:00:44,513 --> 00:00:45,454
We have a quick show of hands.

15
00:00:45,934 --> 00:00:46,734
Okay, quite a few.

16
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:47,034
Great.

17
00:00:47,534 --> 00:00:53,076
So now we're a year in, and so I want to give you an update of how it's gone.

18
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:57,540
We're about to enter the full production phase of the project.

19
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:03,522
So the jury is still out as to whether the independent AAA model will work or not, but

20
00:01:04,662 --> 00:01:07,843
you could say I'm quietly confident at this stage.

21
00:01:09,884 --> 00:01:13,285
Just for those who don't know us very well.

22
00:01:14,446 --> 00:01:17,868
We're what I would call a mid-sized development, a console developer.

23
00:01:17,908 --> 00:01:21,791
We're based in Cambridge, England, and we're working on several projects.

24
00:01:22,251 --> 00:01:28,795
And some of them are large projects, and Hellblade, in this instance, is a very small one.

25
00:01:32,517 --> 00:01:39,402
So over the past 15 years or so, we've created about five console titles, and we've collaborated

26
00:01:39,882 --> 00:01:43,324
with Avalanche Studios and Disney on Disney Infinity 2 and 3.

27
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:47,843
So we are effectively in the AAA console space.

28
00:01:49,764 --> 00:01:51,544
Myself, I've been making games for 20 years,

29
00:01:53,785 --> 00:01:57,087
15 years of which is at Ninja Theory as a programmer, designer,

30
00:01:57,447 --> 00:01:58,868
and now creative director.

31
00:01:59,588 --> 00:02:02,990
So I've seen a few shifts in the industry that are quite big,

32
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,731
and I feel like this one, the digital transition,

33
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:07,992
is going to be the biggest one yet.

34
00:02:10,221 --> 00:02:13,662
So for many people, digital means alternative models.

35
00:02:13,702 --> 00:02:16,983
So it might mean free to play, or indie, or mobile,

36
00:02:17,123 --> 00:02:18,864
or new genres like MOBAs.

37
00:02:19,864 --> 00:02:23,045
But I'm here to really promote a model that I think

38
00:02:23,085 --> 00:02:27,346
has been largely absent, which we call independent AAA,

39
00:02:27,406 --> 00:02:28,486
for lack of a better term.

40
00:02:29,307 --> 00:02:31,207
It means doing what we're good at, what we're used to,

41
00:02:31,227 --> 00:02:34,268
what we're experienced at, high production values,

42
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:39,250
but with the independence and ethos of indie development.

43
00:02:41,207 --> 00:02:45,667
And our new game, Hellblade, is going to be released sometime in 2016,

44
00:02:46,648 --> 00:02:48,648
and it represents our first attempt at this model.

45
00:02:53,029 --> 00:02:58,130
So, to summarize why we're wanting to explore different models,

46
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,591
I'll very briefly cover what the model is and move on.

47
00:03:02,331 --> 00:03:02,511
I mean...

48
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:10,034
I think the AAA retail model, there's nothing wrong with it per se.

49
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:15,179
You get fantastic games that come out, but effectively every game is a blockbuster.

50
00:03:15,679 --> 00:03:21,084
It's like if there was a movie industry where every movie was an Avengers movie or a spin-off.

51
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:25,408
It's not good for developers that are smaller in scale.

52
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:30,753
Largely these are games that are done by internal studios that scale up to 100, 200, 300 people.

53
00:03:33,502 --> 00:03:38,184
And one of the questions I always had is, why is this the case?

54
00:03:38,545 --> 00:03:44,287
And the best answer I can come up with is that it comes down to the price point of games.

55
00:03:44,487 --> 00:03:50,490
Like the retail model is like, I think of it like a grumpy old grandpa that doesn't want to change his ways.

56
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,852
It's got to cost 60 euros or 60 dollars or however much it is.

57
00:03:54,432 --> 00:03:57,373
And that's that. And it's got to be that way because it's always been that way.

58
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,763
And so games have to compete on size.

59
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:05,524
They compete on features.

60
00:04:05,884 --> 00:04:08,446
And they have blow-by-blow features

61
00:04:09,227 --> 00:04:10,547
in each subsequent game.

62
00:04:10,868 --> 00:04:14,350
And this has resulted in what I think is an enormous checklist.

63
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,232
I think this is what you have to do these days

64
00:04:17,272 --> 00:04:18,492
to pitch a AAA game.

65
00:04:18,773 --> 00:04:20,234
You have to cover all these bases

66
00:04:20,314 --> 00:04:24,696
before you can even think about what is unique about the game.

67
00:04:26,618 --> 00:04:31,920
It's a strategy I call the Go Big, Go Home, which someone from, I think, EA once told me.

68
00:04:34,161 --> 00:04:39,303
So it's no coincidence that we are seeing fewer and bigger games succeed,

69
00:04:40,504 --> 00:04:43,925
many of which actually do seem quite similar to each other.

70
00:04:46,206 --> 00:04:46,346
So.

71
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,502
This is a little bit of a sad slide.

72
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:59,626
This is from 2006 to 2012, so it's not even current.

73
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,129
But it's hundreds of developers have disappeared

74
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:04,171
over the last few years.

75
00:05:05,313 --> 00:05:06,634
Very good developers as well.

76
00:05:06,754 --> 00:05:10,598
Not all of them because they made bad games.

77
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:12,040
And in some cases, that's true.

78
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,324
But in other cases, they just don't fit into this model.

79
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:21,071
And if I was to highlight some of my favorite games

80
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:25,533
of a few years ago, I don't think any one of these games

81
00:05:25,553 --> 00:05:28,174
would be published these days under the retail model.

82
00:05:29,275 --> 00:05:32,937
They just simply don't have enough to them

83
00:05:33,097 --> 00:05:35,558
to compete with the big franchises that

84
00:05:35,598 --> 00:05:36,558
are out there today.

85
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:43,021
And I feel like you can call it survival of the fittest,

86
00:05:43,281 --> 00:05:44,862
but I really think there's.

87
00:05:46,665 --> 00:05:50,648
Evolution never really was survival of the fittest, it was survival of the most adaptable.

88
00:05:51,189 --> 00:06:00,057
And when the model is not adapting, then these studios, they die because they don't fit into a particular model.

89
00:06:01,091 --> 00:06:01,792
of the industry.

90
00:06:02,812 --> 00:06:06,755
So I do think that digital gives us an opportunity

91
00:06:06,815 --> 00:06:10,858
to reverse this trend somewhat, to revive games

92
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:14,421
that have been off our radar for a long time.

93
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,103
A lot of teams that have gone away,

94
00:06:18,084 --> 00:06:20,005
there were teams that were functioning well together,

95
00:06:20,205 --> 00:06:22,607
really experienced people that knew how to work together

96
00:06:22,627 --> 00:06:24,969
and knew how to craft amazing experience.

97
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,290
And those teams have been split up.

98
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,072
And in most cases, they're not going to get back together.

99
00:06:31,128 --> 00:06:37,435
So I think there is a loss there, but I also think that there is a lot of promise still to come.

100
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:46,967
So this is where I see the independent AAA model, for us at least.

101
00:06:46,987 --> 00:06:50,010
On the one hand you've got indie games which are...

102
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,411
I'd say most of the innovations are coming from these days.

103
00:06:55,511 --> 00:06:59,453
Most of the interesting concepts are coming through from the indie scene.

104
00:07:00,293 --> 00:07:07,376
And on the other hand, you've got the big franchises, the AAA in quality.

105
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:12,318
I'd like to try and find a space in between this.

106
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:17,300
We want to make games that look stunning, that are, you know, we're known for our storytelling

107
00:07:19,574 --> 00:07:21,615
and production values and we want to keep that.

108
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,717
But simply put, we do want to make games that are

109
00:07:26,578 --> 00:07:29,860
smaller and more focused. So hence the phrase

110
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,343
half the size, half the cost. And size can be length of game or it could be

111
00:07:35,043 --> 00:07:37,525
the feature set that you have in the game. It's kind of...

112
00:07:38,187 --> 00:07:42,330
open to interpretation. But the idea is, you know, we're used to buying stuff for about

113
00:07:43,592 --> 00:07:48,776
25, 30, 40 euros, you know, t-shirts and DVDs and Blu-rays and things, so I don't really

114
00:07:49,297 --> 00:07:54,762
understand why we impose such a big financial commitment of our players.

115
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:09,731
I think the idea perpetuated that you must go big or go home, I think of it as a fallacy.

116
00:08:10,171 --> 00:08:14,295
And I think that fallacy has been proved wrong when the indie scene started to blossom.

117
00:08:14,915 --> 00:08:19,339
Of course some of these games were amazing, of course they sold, and of course they found

118
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:19,880
an audience.

119
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:27,152
Now the story goes that you can either be indie, super low budget, or AAA, and there's

120
00:08:27,192 --> 00:08:27,932
nothing in the middle.

121
00:08:27,992 --> 00:08:35,055
That's a perpetuated statement or fact by a lot of people, a lot of publishers, and

122
00:08:35,135 --> 00:08:36,536
I simply do not believe it.

123
00:08:38,637 --> 00:08:44,680
So we want to chuck out as much of the baggage that really comes with AAA retail and focus

124
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,061
on the areas that we love as a studio.

125
00:08:49,201 --> 00:08:51,222
An affecting character journey, stunning art,

126
00:08:51,302 --> 00:08:52,843
and some great action.

127
00:08:58,585 --> 00:09:00,526
Which brings us to Hellblade.

128
00:09:00,566 --> 00:09:04,588
So given that independent AAA is about creating diverse games,

129
00:09:06,249 --> 00:09:08,790
you should consider this as simply one case study.

130
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:09,711
It's the only one I know.

131
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,121
Although a lot of what I talk about is specific to Hellblade,

132
00:09:16,161 --> 00:09:19,561
I think you should take the ethos forward to whatever games

133
00:09:20,222 --> 00:09:21,862
you may be making or considering.

134
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:26,563
And right now, we've just finished a vertical slice

135
00:09:28,024 --> 00:09:28,844
demo of the game.

136
00:09:28,984 --> 00:09:30,224
And from that, we made a trailer.

137
00:09:30,244 --> 00:09:31,384
So I'd like to show you the trailer

138
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,605
so you know what we're talking about.

139
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:51,043
Darkness is a disease, a rot that takes hold and spreads to every part of me.

140
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,985
And I fear I will follow in your footsteps.

141
00:09:56,326 --> 00:10:02,028
I am alone and scared. I beg for your guidance.

142
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:05,830
Before the darkness takes me.

143
00:10:22,161 --> 00:10:26,604
Few would brave such a desperate journey into darkness.

144
00:10:26,644 --> 00:10:29,446
But it isn't bravery that drives Senua.

145
00:10:29,586 --> 00:10:31,207
Senua...

146
00:10:31,287 --> 00:10:37,051
Only those afraid of death would use such terms.

147
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:41,133
Senua's fear runs far deeper.

148
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:43,014
They know you're weak.

149
00:10:43,055 --> 00:10:44,215
Get up and fight.

150
00:10:44,335 --> 00:10:45,356
You're pathetic.

151
00:10:45,376 --> 00:10:46,697
Control the fear.

152
00:10:46,717 --> 00:10:48,118
Let it pass through.

153
00:10:48,238 --> 00:10:50,019
Remember his words.

154
00:10:51,742 --> 00:10:56,744
I'm going to save you.

155
00:10:58,465 --> 00:10:59,465
Run!

156
00:10:59,605 --> 00:11:01,006
Okay.

157
00:11:24,988 --> 00:11:25,308
Thank you.

158
00:11:25,328 --> 00:11:27,569
Thank you.

159
00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:34,790
So I want to cover a little bit about the model itself and how we're going about doing it

160
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,890
and how we came to this conclusion.

161
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:42,091
So this chart has various budgets for AAA retail games that are not uncommon.

162
00:11:43,712 --> 00:11:46,732
Usually independent developers are at the bottom of the food chain.

163
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:54,319
developers in general are at the bottom of the food chain when it comes to the royalties and upside.

164
00:11:55,419 --> 00:12:01,063
Retailers come first, distributors, platform holders, publishers, they all take their cut.

165
00:12:01,323 --> 00:12:08,708
And then once they've all taken their cut, then the developer has to repay the development fees plus a percentage.

166
00:12:13,182 --> 00:12:16,882
It's... so that's why it's very difficult.

167
00:12:16,922 --> 00:12:19,583
It's a very difficult business for an independent developer

168
00:12:19,623 --> 00:12:20,723
to make royalties on.

169
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:26,344
In effect, we're like the post-industry in films.

170
00:12:26,384 --> 00:12:28,004
We survive project to project,

171
00:12:28,364 --> 00:12:29,905
and there's a chance of a breakout hit,

172
00:12:29,925 --> 00:12:31,145
but it's very unlikely.

173
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:31,845
I mean, it's...

174
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:35,086
I've heard it's less than 5% of games

175
00:12:35,146 --> 00:12:36,426
make royalties for the developer.

176
00:12:36,566 --> 00:12:39,327
I don't even know if it's that high,

177
00:12:39,427 --> 00:12:40,647
to be perfectly frank.

178
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:48,411
So in order to make a go of it, we want to compete by undercutting AAA price points by half.

179
00:12:50,172 --> 00:12:57,855
For a small fry developer like us, that means digital distribution, where we can cut out as many of the middlemen as possible.

180
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:03,296
But the digital market is just not as big as the retail market.

181
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:07,782
There's not as many people on there, at least on the console side.

182
00:13:08,463 --> 00:13:12,168
And it's very difficult to get figures of how many people are out there.

183
00:13:12,228 --> 00:13:15,112
People generally don't seem to share those figures.

184
00:13:18,074 --> 00:13:23,659
So what we did was we thought, OK, what's a reasonable best estimate of a break-even,

185
00:13:23,819 --> 00:13:24,880
like in terms of sales?

186
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,842
Say we do it at half the price of AAA.

187
00:13:27,903 --> 00:13:29,404
What's a good estimate?

188
00:13:29,424 --> 00:13:34,448
And so we came up with 300, 300,000 units across multiple platforms.

189
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:37,951
It's tough, but it's achievable.

190
00:13:38,411 --> 00:13:42,215
It feels like it's a good, ambitious number to go for.

191
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,504
So the price with the break-even suggests a very low budget,

192
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:52,247
probably comparable to a high-end indie budget,

193
00:13:53,328 --> 00:13:56,710
and nowhere near a AAA standard.

194
00:14:03,115 --> 00:14:04,797
But there is an advantage to digital,

195
00:14:04,817 --> 00:14:06,178
which means you have a longer tail.

196
00:14:06,238 --> 00:14:09,100
So I think that there is some other things

197
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,121
that we can play to our advantage.

198
00:14:12,937 --> 00:14:17,319
So a budget of about 15 people for two years is what it equates to.

199
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:24,442
This is far lower than the kind of development team size we have been used to, and it's incomparable

200
00:14:24,502 --> 00:14:28,444
to the team sizes you are seeing in this current generation.

201
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,600
It didn't seem possible or feasible to try and hit AAA quality with 15 people,

202
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,281
but there was reason for optimism.

203
00:14:37,341 --> 00:14:40,682
I mean, tools have been getting a lot better.

204
00:14:40,823 --> 00:14:45,084
I mean, Unity, UE4, productivity, the experience of the team.

205
00:14:45,204 --> 00:14:47,625
Like, we seem to be getting a lot faster.

206
00:14:47,805 --> 00:14:49,806
Heavenly Sword took nearly five years to make.

207
00:14:50,586 --> 00:14:55,928
When we did DMC, we did it with half the people in half the time.

208
00:14:57,028 --> 00:15:00,849
And so I think, so we simply don't know what a small,

209
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:03,409
well, we simply didn't know what a smaller team

210
00:15:03,609 --> 00:15:04,829
was capable of achieving.

211
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:12,811
So I would say take this slide a little bit

212
00:15:12,851 --> 00:15:13,731
with a pinch of salt.

213
00:15:14,551 --> 00:15:16,091
It might be optimistic thinking.

214
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,152
It's not very scientific.

215
00:15:18,592 --> 00:15:19,932
But let's start with the assumption

216
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,472
that you need about 100 people

217
00:15:22,512 --> 00:15:24,113
to make a current AAA game.

218
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,532
Let's say you reduce the scope of the game by half.

219
00:15:28,672 --> 00:15:33,295
Let's say that that reduces your development size by 30%.

220
00:15:33,455 --> 00:15:36,638
I mean, not 50% because there's always fixed costs.

221
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:38,519
So you've got 70 people left.

222
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:43,782
And when you're working with a publisher,

223
00:15:43,802 --> 00:15:45,163
there's always changes in feedback.

224
00:15:46,324 --> 00:15:48,846
And I estimate that it's probably about 15%

225
00:15:49,806 --> 00:15:51,707
of development time is spent.

226
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:56,911
rearranging the project to suit the publisher's needs.

227
00:15:57,151 --> 00:15:58,912
I'm not being mean or nasty.

228
00:15:58,972 --> 00:16:01,653
I think the publisher has to respond to what their audience wants,

229
00:16:01,713 --> 00:16:03,134
and you have to respond to the publisher.

230
00:16:03,854 --> 00:16:06,435
So that figure comes down.

231
00:16:08,096 --> 00:16:10,737
Now, let's say you use middleware like Unity or UE4,

232
00:16:10,957 --> 00:16:12,857
and you say to your team,

233
00:16:12,917 --> 00:16:13,898
don't change anything.

234
00:16:13,998 --> 00:16:16,319
All right, change one thing, but don't change anything else.

235
00:16:16,819 --> 00:16:17,739
And you stick to it.

236
00:16:20,026 --> 00:16:24,010
I think it is possible to save, like there's an enormous saving to be made there.

237
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:27,793
It's pretty much the approach we're taking on Hellblade.

238
00:16:28,094 --> 00:16:32,498
There's three programmers on the team, and for the first six months or so there were

239
00:16:32,538 --> 00:16:33,579
no programmers on the team.

240
00:16:37,826 --> 00:16:42,831
Management overheads, this includes things like managers, producers, communication in general.

241
00:16:43,431 --> 00:16:46,854
There's a lot of inefficiencies that can be saved there.

242
00:16:47,775 --> 00:16:49,697
So you see where I'm going with this.

243
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:55,462
Eventually, it's not that unreasonable to arrive.

244
00:16:56,544 --> 00:17:00,427
at a number like 15. Obviously, I've massaged the figures to reach at 15 because isn't that

245
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:07,072
convenient, but the point is made. At the bigger the team sizes, you start to come up

246
00:17:07,132 --> 00:17:13,036
against resistance, air resistance, and the more you put in, the less you get out.

247
00:17:18,721 --> 00:17:24,946
So what does a team look like? Now, things we found. So in a 15-man team, it's sort of

248
00:17:26,354 --> 00:17:30,299
meaningless to have the concept of hierarchy, leads and bosses.

249
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:33,642
I mean, when you've got one guy making the art for the whole of the world,

250
00:17:33,722 --> 00:17:36,585
what's the point of calling him a lead?

251
00:17:36,846 --> 00:17:40,209
Or rather, actually, we call everyone a lead,

252
00:17:40,229 --> 00:17:41,831
because everyone's in charge of their area.

253
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:48,178
So in our team, there was a little bit of an epiphany partway through that.

254
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:53,780
Everyone's a lead. No one has managerial authority over each other.

255
00:17:54,321 --> 00:18:00,824
Everyone has different responsibilities, so I have a creative direction responsibility as an art director.

256
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:06,308
But that doesn't make me, or I'd like to think, it doesn't necessarily mean that I'm everyone, the people's boss,

257
00:18:06,348 --> 00:18:07,968
and I have to tell them off when they come in late.

258
00:18:08,749 --> 00:18:13,372
I don't really care how people arrange and do their work,

259
00:18:14,132 --> 00:18:18,555
as long as we're all stepping together and we do it out of a place of mutual respect.

260
00:18:19,802 --> 00:18:20,322
and trust.

261
00:18:22,864 --> 00:18:29,749
So we do rely on experience, ambition, and resourceful inventiveness of every member

262
00:18:29,769 --> 00:18:33,532
of the team to come up with solutions to old development problems.

263
00:18:34,252 --> 00:18:37,214
And it really did take a while.

264
00:18:37,294 --> 00:18:42,838
It took nine months maybe, nine months to a year for people to kind of settle into this

265
00:18:42,878 --> 00:18:43,899
kind of way of thinking.

266
00:18:46,211 --> 00:18:52,316
that you really do have to take responsibility and you really do have to do things off your own back and

267
00:18:53,097 --> 00:18:53,818
there has been

268
00:18:54,598 --> 00:18:59,603
shuffling of the team. There have been people that have joined the team that didn't, that left the team,

269
00:19:01,104 --> 00:19:01,925
that it didn't suit them.

270
00:19:03,335 --> 00:19:05,857
And one of the reasons is that everyone on the team

271
00:19:05,877 --> 00:19:08,099
has to effectively do a couple of different jobs,

272
00:19:08,139 --> 00:19:09,100
two or three different jobs.

273
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,361
So you need polymaths.

274
00:19:11,222 --> 00:19:14,085
And the industry has been specializing people.

275
00:19:14,645 --> 00:19:16,827
We've been focused on specializing people

276
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:18,469
into very narrow disciplines.

277
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:22,813
And it's tough to then ask that person,

278
00:19:23,674 --> 00:19:25,575
we also need you to do this and the other,

279
00:19:25,676 --> 00:19:27,517
when they don't have much experience

280
00:19:27,577 --> 00:19:28,438
or knowledge in that area.

281
00:19:29,738 --> 00:19:33,180
So we have wound up with 15 people that are very experienced.

282
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:36,362
It's turned out that way.

283
00:19:43,947 --> 00:19:44,388
Okay.

284
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:54,054
So I want to give you a good example of how limits can drive innovation and solutions.

285
00:19:54,134 --> 00:19:54,935
And our approach to...

286
00:19:56,148 --> 00:19:58,411
building environment art in this case.

287
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,453
So there's one environment artist, Dan,

288
00:20:02,394 --> 00:20:06,198
and he's in charge of creating the whole of the world

289
00:20:06,358 --> 00:20:09,381
of Helheim, which is the setting of the game.

290
00:20:09,801 --> 00:20:12,443
And it's a large world, that's a mere section of it.

291
00:20:13,044 --> 00:20:16,888
So he started to research ways of building the world

292
00:20:17,188 --> 00:20:18,929
with kit parts, which isn't new,

293
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:19,990
building worlds with kit parts,

294
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,553
but strangely, something we've never really done before.

295
00:20:25,476 --> 00:20:31,819
Looking at things like decals and different methods of using the same decals across large areas.

296
00:20:32,939 --> 00:20:40,562
Finding ways of creating procedurally generated content, or in this case, blueprints.

297
00:20:40,622 --> 00:20:42,743
Writing blueprints. That's very technical.

298
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,904
So that makes the job of populating the world a lot easier.

299
00:20:47,425 --> 00:20:52,148
Finding new ways of creating texture maps that may involve some procedural texture map,

300
00:20:52,188 --> 00:20:59,452
some of it's modeled, some of it's hand drawn, and combining them in ways that look rich

301
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:02,354
and don't look like the world's full of repeated patterns.

302
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:08,137
We've just got a 3D scanner, a handheld 3D scanner, that we're using to also scan real

303
00:21:08,157 --> 00:21:08,838
world objects.

304
00:21:10,141 --> 00:21:16,906
So the first year of development, the first, well, maybe nine months, has been spent prototyping

305
00:21:16,966 --> 00:21:18,347
across the whole of the game.

306
00:21:20,128 --> 00:21:26,852
Because when you do this, you have to, you come to the realization that you can't just

307
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:29,534
design a game and then ask 15 people to make it.

308
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:32,596
You have to work out what those 15 people are capable of.

309
00:21:33,507 --> 00:21:35,649
And this is another example, more of a team effort.

310
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,131
This is, how do you do performance capture?

311
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:41,514
Performance capture is something that we're known for.

312
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:43,977
We did it, our first game was Heavenly Sword.

313
00:21:44,017 --> 00:21:47,380
We shot it in Weta, at Weta in New Zealand.

314
00:21:48,241 --> 00:21:52,525
And it's the capturing of face, body, voice.

315
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:55,292
and cameras all at the same time.

316
00:21:55,372 --> 00:21:58,236
So the idea is that if a scene feels good on set,

317
00:21:58,537 --> 00:21:59,839
you've already got all the data you need

318
00:21:59,879 --> 00:22:01,341
to turn it into the final form.

319
00:22:01,841 --> 00:22:04,345
And it's something that even AAA studios these days

320
00:22:04,405 --> 00:22:08,351
don't use, don't do, because it's seen as complex or costly.

321
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:12,354
So when we buy, you know, we've cobbled together,

322
00:22:12,434 --> 00:22:14,476
we've prototyped a lot, and we've failed a lot

323
00:22:14,576 --> 00:22:15,817
with a lot of our prototypes.

324
00:22:16,537 --> 00:22:18,839
And we've bought, a lot of our setup

325
00:22:18,939 --> 00:22:23,562
is stuff we've bought from Maplin Electronics, IKEA.

326
00:22:24,663 --> 00:22:34,489
Amazon. And we've tackled every stage of the kind of process from body capture phase, voice, cameras, 3D scanning,

327
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:47,078
created our own little prototype devices like this. So this is a plant pot with some LED lights and with it you can capture skin details like surface, like wrinkles and things.

328
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:52,913
So it actually turns out that it's quite fun when you start doing this stuff.

329
00:22:53,033 --> 00:22:57,136
And half of it didn't work, but half of it did.

330
00:22:58,097 --> 00:22:59,618
And we're using that.

331
00:22:59,658 --> 00:23:06,503
So the cut scenes I'm going to show you in a bit is shot in our main meeting room with

332
00:23:06,523 --> 00:23:07,123
that equipment.

333
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:11,847
Right.

334
00:23:13,088 --> 00:23:13,248
So...

335
00:23:15,067 --> 00:23:19,669
So, like, it's all well and good to say, yes, you can do it with 15 people for two years,

336
00:23:19,709 --> 00:23:24,772
but that's still expensive, that's still a few million dollars, or euros.

337
00:23:26,553 --> 00:23:28,294
How do you get the money to do that?

338
00:23:28,414 --> 00:23:36,738
So last, well, a year and a half ago or so, when we were showing Hellblade around, there

339
00:23:36,778 --> 00:23:41,701
really isn't much, there really isn't many, much in the way of...

340
00:23:42,924 --> 00:23:49,729
a model to fund this. We went to publishers, but publishers, their policy is generally

341
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:57,415
to own IP. So that straight away, that's the first question we would ask. Is your policy

342
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:59,117
to own IP? Yes. Okay.

343
00:24:02,259 --> 00:24:09,805
So there's also Kickstarter. About this time, Kickstarter started to get some negative press.

344
00:24:11,111 --> 00:24:19,258
We didn't want to go down that road because we feel like the only thing that we own, that we carry from our previous games,

345
00:24:19,878 --> 00:24:24,403
is the following that we have from our fans and gamers.

346
00:24:24,523 --> 00:24:36,814
So we didn't want to try and prove an unproven model and kind of risk the goodwill of the only really tangible thing we do have.

347
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:41,153
So we made a choice to not go down the Kickstarter route.

348
00:24:41,874 --> 00:24:47,399
It might be something that we do in future, but I want to feel confident that we can actually

349
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,360
pull this off.

350
00:24:49,562 --> 00:24:53,225
Early access is another thing that came up, and it wasn't for us.

351
00:24:53,305 --> 00:24:54,226
Not in a story game.

352
00:24:54,266 --> 00:24:56,428
We can't put out a broken story.

353
00:24:57,089 --> 00:24:58,370
We don't want to give away any spoilers.

354
00:24:58,610 --> 00:24:59,051
It's not for us.

355
00:25:03,728 --> 00:25:04,808
So where did we get the money?

356
00:25:04,828 --> 00:25:10,610
Some of it was savings, like a good chunk of it was just savings that we've had in the bank.

357
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:17,332
We took out a good sizeable loan, which we'll have to pay back.

358
00:25:18,812 --> 00:25:23,434
We've managed to get some grant money, which has been very useful.

359
00:25:23,554 --> 00:25:24,454
More on that in a sec.

360
00:25:26,126 --> 00:25:28,968
In the UK, there's a 20% tax break, and that certainly helps.

361
00:25:30,009 --> 00:25:33,031
But another thing you can do is, when you're going to service providers,

362
00:25:33,551 --> 00:25:36,634
maybe it's art outsourced houses or localization or whatever,

363
00:25:38,255 --> 00:25:41,637
a lot of these studios actually would prefer to get a back-end deal,

364
00:25:42,017 --> 00:25:45,700
a percentage of your royalties, rather than a front-end payment.

365
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,783
It's something publishers don't generally do for service providers,

366
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,105
but for us it helps, it helps enormously.

367
00:25:55,643 --> 00:25:58,887
And in terms of additional SKUs and DLC and expansion,

368
00:25:59,888 --> 00:26:01,850
with this long tail of digital, I

369
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:05,734
think it's more reasonable to put off those costs

370
00:26:06,035 --> 00:26:08,057
and bootstrap them as the game comes out.

371
00:26:09,258 --> 00:26:11,981
So hence, we're targeting two platforms initially,

372
00:26:12,061 --> 00:26:13,723
PlayStation 4 and PC.

373
00:26:14,764 --> 00:26:17,107
But we will hope to take it on to more platforms.

374
00:26:18,509 --> 00:26:19,670
And then lastly, there's a shop.

375
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:23,053
We're putting our finishing touches to a shop.

376
00:26:23,113 --> 00:26:24,614
We've never sold anything directly.

377
00:26:26,215 --> 00:26:30,399
So that's going online, and we'll see how that goes.

378
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:33,462
We're going to sell t-shirts and all the usual stuff

379
00:26:33,502 --> 00:26:35,544
you might get on a Kickstarter program.

380
00:26:36,064 --> 00:26:37,946
And we will consider that bonus money.

381
00:26:38,006 --> 00:26:39,967
So any money we make there, we'll

382
00:26:39,987 --> 00:26:41,008
stick it back into the game.

383
00:26:46,702 --> 00:26:51,670
So for us, doing something like this is risky.

384
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:55,776
So part of what we want to do is to stick to what we know,

385
00:26:55,957 --> 00:26:59,943
know who our audience is, do the things that people like in us.

386
00:27:00,984 --> 00:27:01,104
And

387
00:27:02,802 --> 00:27:07,345
But having said that, I also don't think that if you're going to do something like this,

388
00:27:07,405 --> 00:27:10,308
a smaller cut-down game, it's not enough to say,

389
00:27:10,508 --> 00:27:11,689
remember those games that we did?

390
00:27:11,789 --> 00:27:12,569
Well, we're just going to...

391
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,771
Well, here's a little cut-down version of it.

392
00:27:15,131 --> 00:27:17,433
You know, that's not a selling point.

393
00:27:17,833 --> 00:27:22,196
You have to find something better to offer.

394
00:27:22,736 --> 00:27:24,418
And you think, well, how do you make something better for...

395
00:27:25,697 --> 00:27:30,841
Much less. And I think this draws analogies with movies, independent movies.

396
00:27:30,881 --> 00:27:35,825
I mean, you wouldn't say that something like Drive or Black Swan or whatever,

397
00:27:35,886 --> 00:27:38,768
Memento, whatever your favorite indie movie is, is any better than...

398
00:27:39,388 --> 00:27:44,392
You wouldn't say that those movies are worse than Avengers, Age of Ultron, would you?

399
00:27:44,593 --> 00:27:49,256
It's different experiences, and you could argue that they're better.

400
00:27:49,316 --> 00:27:49,897
They are better.

401
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,362
But that's not to say that big budget movies can't be great as well.

402
00:27:55,142 --> 00:27:58,925
It's just, in gaming, there sort of isn't that equivalent.

403
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:04,709
A game that looks like a AAA game, but it's got that indie kind of feel.

404
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:08,953
It's got that independent movie kind of thematic gravitas.

405
00:28:13,605 --> 00:28:22,514
So as you saw in the trailer, I mean, we touched on the idea of mental health, mental illness.

406
00:28:23,075 --> 00:28:26,078
And so why did we pick that?

407
00:28:26,158 --> 00:28:32,624
I mean, I think gaming is unlike any other medium in the sense that you can engage an

408
00:28:32,664 --> 00:28:35,727
individual's undivided attention for hours at a time.

409
00:28:36,737 --> 00:28:39,018
And players can embody the main character,

410
00:28:39,658 --> 00:28:40,878
making choices, taking action.

411
00:28:40,918 --> 00:28:45,220
I mean, this is what makes gaming such a powerful medium.

412
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,241
And it's a tool through which you

413
00:28:48,281 --> 00:28:50,082
can see the world through another person's eyes.

414
00:28:50,182 --> 00:28:53,463
And we don't often really exploit that.

415
00:28:54,944 --> 00:29:00,548
So the mental health theme came because I was interested in the subject.

416
00:29:01,769 --> 00:29:03,610
I have a personal interest in the subject.

417
00:29:05,391 --> 00:29:09,814
I've got a personal interest in the mind, creativity.

418
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,816
It's stuff I do outside of games. I like reading up on that stuff.

419
00:29:13,576 --> 00:29:19,700
And it led me to reading about psychosis and schizophrenia.

420
00:29:20,901 --> 00:29:23,242
And I wondered, like maybe a lot of people might do,

421
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:23,903
what that would look like.

422
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,721
When that person is talking to nothing, do they actually see someone?

423
00:29:27,762 --> 00:29:32,004
So I went to find out, I read about it, I saw videos that represent what it's like

424
00:29:32,064 --> 00:29:40,208
and it's truly, truly shocking, but also amazing that our brains can create

425
00:29:41,468 --> 00:29:46,631
such fantastical concepts, imagery and belief systems

426
00:29:49,052 --> 00:29:52,474
that make someone believe that there's a demon in their room and see them.

427
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:58,261
that's staring at them at night, or that you can hear someone shouting at you, speaking

428
00:29:58,301 --> 00:30:03,527
to you, a voice, 24 hours a day, and you can't stop it and control it.

429
00:30:04,768 --> 00:30:08,133
So I wanted to...

430
00:30:10,304 --> 00:30:14,807
find out more, and I thought games is a good medium to do this.

431
00:30:15,608 --> 00:30:20,232
And I felt like it's a taboo subject, and it doesn't need to be.

432
00:30:20,592 --> 00:30:24,035
A lot of people get help, a lot of people recover, a lot of people deal with it.

433
00:30:24,435 --> 00:30:28,619
It shouldn't be a taboo when I would pretty much bet that

434
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:31,201
everyone in this room has been touched by it,

435
00:30:32,442 --> 00:30:35,565
either directly or indirectly, at some point in their lives.

436
00:30:39,014 --> 00:30:44,315
So one way to get over a taboo is to make it public, to talk about it.

437
00:30:47,376 --> 00:30:52,297
Obviously incredibly nervous about putting out that trailer and kind of announcing that

438
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:56,618
the theme is serious mental health conditions.

439
00:30:56,958 --> 00:31:02,940
The response has been as good as we possibly could have wanted or imagined.

440
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,401
It feels like there's a lot of gamers that

441
00:31:08,762 --> 00:31:15,824
are familiar with mental health issues, and they saw this as a game that acknowledges

442
00:31:17,224 --> 00:31:22,905
what it's like, or acknowledges their struggles, if you like.

443
00:31:23,706 --> 00:31:29,827
And where some... it's not all been positive, some people have been negative, they felt

444
00:31:29,907 --> 00:31:34,469
offended, really offended by the fact that we're taking a subject like that and making

445
00:31:34,509 --> 00:31:35,169
a game out of it.

446
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:42,226
Many times when people have expressed that on comments, YouTube comments or whatever,

447
00:31:42,306 --> 00:31:43,830
others have jumped in and said, well actually...

448
00:31:45,262 --> 00:31:49,144
I'm in this camp and I think that it's a good thing to try and tackle.

449
00:31:49,664 --> 00:31:54,126
People have got in touch with us directly about it and we've responded directly to them.

450
00:31:55,027 --> 00:31:55,967
We've engaged with them.

451
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:57,648
We want to know what they're worried about.

452
00:31:57,688 --> 00:32:05,491
We want to know if they'll tell us what their experience is and we're being very open and

453
00:32:05,571 --> 00:32:08,853
sincere about our communication on this front.

454
00:32:12,451 --> 00:32:18,760
So I'd say for now, we've been given the benefits of the doubt, and it's something that we have to

455
00:32:20,763 --> 00:32:23,427
understand that this isn't a free pass to do whatever we want.

456
00:32:27,732 --> 00:32:33,036
Early on in development, we contacted a psychiatrist.

457
00:32:33,777 --> 00:32:34,698
His name is Paul Fletcher.

458
00:32:34,718 --> 00:32:38,901
He's a psychiatrist and professor of health neuroscience at Cambridge University.

459
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,965
He was fascinated by the potential of games.

460
00:32:45,186 --> 00:32:47,308
He came to the studio, talked to us.

461
00:32:47,668 --> 00:32:48,669
He presented the latest...

462
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:54,771
scientific or neurological model of the mind.

463
00:32:54,791 --> 00:32:58,672
He related what people's experiences are like.

464
00:32:59,433 --> 00:33:04,074
He produced research papers and condensed them down in a way we could understand.

465
00:33:04,574 --> 00:33:07,995
And he's been involved for a few months, coming into the office,

466
00:33:08,075 --> 00:33:09,875
looking at what we're doing, giving us advice.

467
00:33:11,116 --> 00:33:15,777
And Senua is largely, the main protagonist Senua,

468
00:33:15,817 --> 00:33:19,458
is largely a character that's formed because of his input.

469
00:33:21,787 --> 00:33:26,090
And so I'd like to show the cutscene that we,

470
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:28,692
the test shoot, the test cutscene that we shoot

471
00:33:29,752 --> 00:33:32,334
to try and represent some of that.

472
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,200
I'm not turning back.

473
00:33:42,881 --> 00:33:44,101
It took months to get here.

474
00:33:47,003 --> 00:33:48,884
Well, maybe, but I made my promise.

475
00:33:51,434 --> 00:33:52,594
We'll all die someday.

476
00:33:53,235 --> 00:33:54,136
It's getting dark.

477
00:33:54,396 --> 00:33:55,597
I'll continue tomorrow.

478
00:33:56,518 --> 00:33:57,919
You're afraid of the dark.

479
00:33:58,159 --> 00:33:59,320
I'm being patient.

480
00:34:01,602 --> 00:34:05,064
Getting closer to him.

481
00:34:05,165 --> 00:34:05,945
I hope so.

482
00:34:06,205 --> 00:34:07,687
You're sure it's safe here?

483
00:34:07,907 --> 00:34:08,267
Yes.

484
00:34:09,108 --> 00:34:10,129
Nobody followed us.

485
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:11,209
Be careful.

486
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:12,130
I know.

487
00:34:14,612 --> 00:34:16,153
I just wish I could rest a little.

488
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:34,653
shit

489
00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:34,773
shit

490
00:34:34,793 --> 00:34:35,574
someone's here

491
00:35:10,089 --> 00:35:16,511
This makes things quickly understandable.

492
00:35:16,571 --> 00:35:18,312
Thank you for watching!

493
00:35:46,638 --> 00:35:52,919
So, there's one charity that has helped us enormously.

494
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:56,260
It's a charity called the Welcome Trust, which possibly you've not heard of,

495
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,041
but it's the second biggest charity in the world after Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

496
00:36:00,061 --> 00:36:07,983
I think they give out something like a hundred, no, a billion dollars a year for research,

497
00:36:08,243 --> 00:36:10,683
but also a portion of that is given to...

498
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:20,927
movies, arts, and games for projects that try to further the understanding and science of it.

499
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:28,572
So they gave us a very small grant at the beginning and that allowed us to work

500
00:36:29,573 --> 00:36:34,977
deeper with Professor Paul Fletcher and create, get that far, create that cutscene.

501
00:36:36,338 --> 00:36:40,321
Since then we've received a larger award and

502
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:49,396
This was, this helped us enormously and what they offer is like, what they want us to do

503
00:36:49,556 --> 00:36:53,039
is to make an entertaining, compelling experience, a game.

504
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:59,245
And what they want and what they think they can help us with is to try and represent

505
00:37:00,045 --> 00:37:06,689
the experiences of peoples and the scientific theories behind it in a truthful way.

506
00:37:06,749 --> 00:37:10,311
So for us it's a win-win. It's good research.

507
00:37:10,871 --> 00:37:15,374
It means we can make a more believable character and a more believable experience in the world.

508
00:37:17,055 --> 00:37:20,977
And because of their backing, we now have...

509
00:37:23,677 --> 00:37:31,843
It's easier for us to approach mental health organizations and charities.

510
00:37:32,364 --> 00:37:36,908
So one of the things we've done recently is we met with a group of service users

511
00:37:38,129 --> 00:37:45,255
who have had very serious psychotic experiences in the past or currently.

512
00:37:45,855 --> 00:37:48,377
And we showed them our vertical slice and played through.

513
00:37:49,304 --> 00:37:55,189
through it with them. And they gave us feedback on how their experiences relate to it or how

514
00:37:55,269 --> 00:38:00,574
it doesn't relate to it. And they gave us a lot of encouragement to continue forward.

515
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:06,780
And they were very excited. It was a really nice experience. They were very excited and

516
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:12,666
thrilled to be involved. And we're going to continue to be involved with them intimately

517
00:38:12,686 --> 00:38:13,326
for the next year.

518
00:38:15,348 --> 00:38:18,809
So, really, Wellcome has introduced, has opened up

519
00:38:18,909 --> 00:38:22,290
doors to us that we otherwise wouldn't have had open.

520
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:25,591
And Ian Dog, I'm sorry, I can't, I don't know,

521
00:38:25,711 --> 00:38:26,632
I can't pronounce his surname.

522
00:38:26,852 --> 00:38:28,852
Ian Dog-dog-dog-dog-dog-don, I think it is,

523
00:38:29,593 --> 00:38:31,713
is the Creative Partnerships Manager,

524
00:38:31,733 --> 00:38:34,474
and they're on the lookout for games that try

525
00:38:34,514 --> 00:38:37,895
and further the understanding of science or health.

526
00:38:37,955 --> 00:38:40,096
So, it's worth looking into,

527
00:38:40,176 --> 00:38:41,777
if that's an area you're working in.

528
00:38:49,554 --> 00:38:54,928
OK, so one thing we did after our meeting with the service users

529
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,934
is to try and put some of their...

530
00:38:58,012 --> 00:39:01,075
thoughts and experiences into the game,

531
00:39:01,335 --> 00:39:03,356
like rapid prototyping, try and figure out

532
00:39:03,697 --> 00:39:06,219
if we can represent what they see and hear better.

533
00:39:06,259 --> 00:39:09,561
So what we have here is a video that shows some quotes,

534
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:13,604
some statements made from some of the group,

535
00:39:13,705 --> 00:39:16,146
but also from a wider range of feedback

536
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:20,050
that Professor Paul gave us, and where we're at.

537
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:22,111
I mean, we've only been doing this for a couple weeks now,

538
00:39:22,211 --> 00:39:24,073
so it's something where we want to.

539
00:39:25,589 --> 00:39:28,331
We're very excited about it. We want to push forward as far as we can.

540
00:39:41,501 --> 00:39:47,305
As we all know my heart is so, I'll be so far away

541
00:39:47,365 --> 00:39:51,408
Don't you know I want to feel deeper

542
00:39:53,435 --> 00:39:58,217
I could never know how you grow, all these days are killing me

543
00:39:59,258 --> 00:40:05,642
Now I see deep in me insanity does unfold

544
00:40:05,662 --> 00:40:11,045
I just wanna feel, I just wanna feel deeper, deeper

545
00:40:11,485 --> 00:40:16,588
I just wanna feel, I just wanna feel deeper, deeper

546
00:40:32,194 --> 00:40:37,097
As you know my heart is so, I feel so far away

547
00:40:38,058 --> 00:40:42,581
Don't you know how I wanna feel deeper?

548
00:40:44,182 --> 00:40:49,045
I could never know how you grow, all these days are killing me

549
00:40:50,026 --> 00:40:54,629
Feel like this, read like this, I just wanna live, that's all

550
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:59,573
I just wanna feel, I just wanna feel deeper

551
00:41:02,485 --> 00:41:06,753
I just might feel, I just might feel deeper, deeper.

552
00:41:18,712 --> 00:41:25,495
So I personally can't wait to keep doing this and showing it back to the group and getting

553
00:41:25,535 --> 00:41:27,396
people's points of view and getting their feedback.

554
00:41:29,898 --> 00:41:38,122
And what came out of some of those meetings is the flip side to the more horrific side

555
00:41:38,142 --> 00:41:39,763
of things that we're used to seeing.

556
00:41:40,384 --> 00:41:44,706
The idea that sometimes it can be stunningly beautiful.

557
00:41:49,279 --> 00:41:51,359
For some service users, they wouldn't change a thing.

558
00:41:57,441 --> 00:42:01,143
So the final part of our strategy is open development.

559
00:42:02,983 --> 00:42:05,364
So even if we're able to make a compelling game

560
00:42:05,444 --> 00:42:08,105
and complete it under the independent AAA model,

561
00:42:08,605 --> 00:42:12,206
there really still is a high chance of commercial failure

562
00:42:12,246 --> 00:42:13,647
if we can't raise awareness.

563
00:42:14,327 --> 00:42:17,248
And like most Indies, we don't have.

564
00:42:19,708 --> 00:42:21,150
marketing and PR budget.

565
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:25,234
And so this is partly why we're being open about our development.

566
00:42:26,295 --> 00:42:30,659
And the way we're doing this is we've released 13 video diaries so far,

567
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:34,002
one per month, each around seven to nine minutes long,

568
00:42:34,903 --> 00:42:37,405
to show people how we're making Hellblade.

569
00:42:38,326 --> 00:42:39,267
And we do these in-house.

570
00:42:41,678 --> 00:42:50,689
It's not expensive. It's someone with a Canon camera and a microphone and a copy of Vegas.

571
00:42:53,235 --> 00:42:59,879
It's each episode covering a different topic and it's got a loyal following now.

572
00:42:59,919 --> 00:43:02,780
It's something we hope to build over the months.

573
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:06,622
And as well as that, we're doing Q&A and social media.

574
00:43:07,563 --> 00:43:09,644
With the press, we're letting them just come and visit us.

575
00:43:09,724 --> 00:43:12,886
So there's very little that we are hiding from the press.

576
00:43:12,926 --> 00:43:16,428
In fact, the only thing we're hiding from the press is the actual story itself.

577
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:19,089
They have access to the full team.

578
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:21,029
They can talk to anyone, unsupervised,

579
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:23,070
whoever they want on the team.

580
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:30,254
And we're confident that they come away feeling impressed.

581
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:34,496
But also, they come away with something different each time,

582
00:43:34,536 --> 00:43:36,097
because they each come at different points

583
00:43:36,597 --> 00:43:37,257
in development.

584
00:43:38,778 --> 00:43:41,359
And it's resulted in a few game covers.

585
00:43:41,399 --> 00:43:42,520
I think that's quite.

586
00:43:43,473 --> 00:43:46,735
That's been quite remarkable for a game, for us anyway,

587
00:43:46,755 --> 00:43:48,877
for a game so early in development.

588
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,743
So, I mean, what we want to achieve with this whole thing

589
00:43:57,983 --> 00:44:01,646
is, first and foremost, we want to make a great game.

590
00:44:01,666 --> 00:44:03,047
I mean, we're in it for that.

591
00:44:03,527 --> 00:44:06,129
And we want to offer a new experience, something

592
00:44:06,169 --> 00:44:11,833
that we haven't created before and gamers haven't experienced

593
00:44:11,873 --> 00:44:12,233
before.

594
00:44:13,633 --> 00:44:22,578
So, really, this does mean striving for financial independence so that we can strive for creative independence.

595
00:44:25,137 --> 00:44:31,061
And we hope that being open will inspire other developers like us, or students, or whoever's out there,

596
00:44:31,661 --> 00:44:35,844
to help make gaming a more diverse and exciting space.

597
00:44:37,545 --> 00:44:41,027
We have nothing to gain by being secretive about it,

598
00:44:41,327 --> 00:44:44,029
oh sorry, nothing to lose by being secretive about it,

599
00:44:44,389 --> 00:44:48,051
and so far we've gained a lot from being open about it, in terms of support.

600
00:44:49,272 --> 00:44:50,853
People like Sony, Epic, Vicon.

601
00:44:51,574 --> 00:44:57,597
NVIDIA, all of them feel sorry for us in some ways, I guess you could say, and have

602
00:44:57,697 --> 00:45:00,158
supported us in various manners.

603
00:45:03,641 --> 00:45:09,446
And I think actually, you know, part of the reason they're helping us is because they

604
00:45:09,486 --> 00:45:11,067
want to see a bigger ecosystem.

605
00:45:11,367 --> 00:45:17,072
Vicon want to see their low-end motion capture equipment used by more developers, not just

606
00:45:17,092 --> 00:45:18,193
the high-end things.

607
00:45:18,233 --> 00:45:22,137
You know, everyone's got an interest in there being more games, more exciting games made

608
00:45:22,157 --> 00:45:22,838
by more people.

609
00:45:25,128 --> 00:45:28,131
We're not taking away anything from AAA publishing.

610
00:45:28,231 --> 00:45:31,314
We're not taking anything away from the indie scene.

611
00:45:31,334 --> 00:45:35,058
We just want to create a full, rich landscape of gaming.

612
00:45:35,518 --> 00:45:38,081
And we do that by being open about it.

613
00:45:38,141 --> 00:45:39,822
Because it's no good us just saying, yeah,

614
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:42,185
for a few million dollars and 13 or 15 people,

615
00:45:42,225 --> 00:45:42,925
you can make games.

616
00:45:43,626 --> 00:45:45,926
We want to show also how we're doing it.

617
00:45:46,266 --> 00:45:48,027
And it might not work, and if it doesn't work,

618
00:45:48,367 --> 00:45:50,527
there'll be someone out there that looks at us and goes,

619
00:45:50,587 --> 00:45:51,588
well, that's where you went wrong.

620
00:45:51,928 --> 00:45:52,528
We'll do it better.

621
00:45:52,628 --> 00:45:54,188
And that's fine.

622
00:45:54,428 --> 00:45:57,189
There's a high risk of embarrassment and failure

623
00:45:57,229 --> 00:46:00,989
of being open, but I think there's an even bigger

624
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,510
risk of being closed.

625
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:14,241
With that, I mean, if you do want to follow Hellblade

626
00:46:14,261 --> 00:46:17,702
and what's going on, it's easy to find out.

627
00:46:17,842 --> 00:46:19,962
But thank you very much for your time

628
00:46:20,062 --> 00:46:22,643
and this being the last session of the day.

629
00:46:23,123 --> 00:46:27,024
We probably have time for a few questions

630
00:46:27,144 --> 00:46:28,865
if anyone would like to ask them.

631
00:46:29,185 --> 00:46:30,585
But thank you very much.

632
00:46:40,151 --> 00:46:40,551
Thank you.

633
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,883
Hi, it's the first time I heard of the game.

634
00:46:51,923 --> 00:47:00,752
Can you describe a little bit more the sort of mental illnesses the protagonist is suffering?

635
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:05,402
So, yes, okay, so what kind of mental illnesses does she have?

636
00:47:06,644 --> 00:47:10,908
So what's important to say is that this is a journey not about mental illness, it's a

637
00:47:10,948 --> 00:47:13,671
journey about Senua with her particular...

638
00:47:15,407 --> 00:47:26,131
because it's different for everyone. So with that, we've modeled it on cases of psychosis.

639
00:47:26,551 --> 00:47:36,335
So you could say there's symptoms like hallucinations, visual and aural hallucinations, anxiety,

640
00:47:38,656 --> 00:47:43,739
And there's a term like schizophrenia, I'd hesitate myself to say she has schizophrenia

641
00:47:43,759 --> 00:47:50,184
because it's a diagnostic term that actually it means a collection of symptoms and it can

642
00:47:50,824 --> 00:47:57,669
include hallucinations, anxiety, depression, it can include a whole series of things.

643
00:48:02,373 --> 00:48:03,433
Yep, another question over there?

644
00:48:12,594 --> 00:48:18,639
I was wondering, you mentioned you were a middling studio of like 115 people, but you

645
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:21,422
only have 15 people working on Hellblade right now.

646
00:48:21,962 --> 00:48:25,786
So once you succeed, because let's say that you will succeed, because we want you to,

647
00:48:26,947 --> 00:48:32,291
do you see transitioning into like seven parallel teams all doing this sort of smaller scale

648
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:32,812
projects?

649
00:48:32,872 --> 00:48:33,632
I don't know.

650
00:48:33,652 --> 00:48:35,434
I don't know.

651
00:48:37,376 --> 00:48:37,836
I don't know.

652
00:48:37,876 --> 00:48:38,296
I don't know.

653
00:48:39,862 --> 00:48:44,685
When you're working in the big AAA space,

654
00:48:44,705 --> 00:48:47,146
you have a lot of people dedicated to that.

655
00:48:47,486 --> 00:48:50,808
And that's great, because you've got secure employment

656
00:48:50,868 --> 00:48:51,689
for a lot of people.

657
00:48:52,489 --> 00:48:56,191
But you're only one green light away from losing that.

658
00:48:56,751 --> 00:48:59,613
And I want to make sure that we have a backup.

659
00:49:00,053 --> 00:49:01,774
Like, I want to make sure that we create

660
00:49:01,794 --> 00:49:02,815
some projects that we own.

661
00:49:03,075 --> 00:49:04,996
I'd like to repeat it, is the short answer.

662
00:49:05,016 --> 00:49:07,417
And I think probably the best strategy

663
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:08,798
is to have a balance of the two.

664
00:49:14,644 --> 00:49:20,168
Any other questions? Let's see, there's one hand up right at the back and another one in between.

665
00:49:29,715 --> 00:49:40,783
Hi, the art style that you've chosen, is that a conscious decision in terms of one person being able to create that world, you know, rather than the kind of...

666
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:46,924
setting. Was that something that's conscious because of the constraints of the project

667
00:49:46,964 --> 00:49:48,906
or is it more just to do with the narrative itself?

668
00:49:49,826 --> 00:49:57,212
Yeah, so I would say the art style is more influenced from our past games. Games like

669
00:49:57,252 --> 00:50:04,899
Heavenly Sword and Enslave. I wanted to create a fantasy setting. It's kind of our heritage.

670
00:50:07,659 --> 00:50:14,004
But I didn't want to go down the tropes of, you know, Lord of the Rings and things like that.

671
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:23,651
And I see the mind as the ultimate creator of fantasies. So, in essence, the game feels real,

672
00:50:23,931 --> 00:50:28,375
like it feels like a historical piece. It's a Celtic warrior going to Norway,

673
00:50:28,635 --> 00:50:32,438
fighting a war. But the fantastical elements come from her own mind.

674
00:50:34,981 --> 00:50:38,363
So everything is pretty dark and grim and real in that sense.

675
00:50:38,643 --> 00:50:42,605
If you mean, if by real you mean present day reality,

676
00:50:43,746 --> 00:50:46,847
I prefer fantasy because I think with fantasy you can get away with

677
00:50:48,288 --> 00:50:50,489
dropping people's prejudices in a way.

678
00:50:51,325 --> 00:50:57,108
You can approach subjects that, in our environment,

679
00:50:57,448 --> 00:50:59,128
we immediately put up barriers and say,

680
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:02,470
well, we've already got our barriers up.

681
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:04,371
And I think fantasy can do that,

682
00:51:05,331 --> 00:51:06,732
like George Orwell's 1984

683
00:51:07,653 --> 00:51:12,755
and George Romero's Dawn and Day of the Dead.

684
00:51:13,055 --> 00:51:16,377
These are fantasies that let you see the world differently,

685
00:51:16,397 --> 00:51:17,017
and I like that.

686
00:51:17,437 --> 00:51:18,438
It's one step removed.

687
00:51:20,845 --> 00:51:23,246
Okay, we've got one more, we've got another question there.

688
00:51:24,506 --> 00:51:28,947
Hello, thanks for the presentation. I actually wanted to ask you the question regarding the

689
00:51:29,847 --> 00:51:36,769
management that there is, the team management question.

690
00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:42,210
So in every team there are sometimes, you know, like, argues in a good way on something.

691
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:48,612
So how do you come to a conclusion in the team where, you know, like, everybody is responsible for his part and...

692
00:51:50,256 --> 00:51:51,597
So you have a team that...

693
00:51:52,258 --> 00:51:58,884
No, like you showed the scheme of your team of 15 people, everybody is responsible for his own part.

694
00:51:59,385 --> 00:52:06,672
But if sometimes, well, in every team sometimes there are argues on something, like a project, how do you resolve that?

695
00:52:06,992 --> 00:52:09,935
If they are arguing against it or something like that.

696
00:52:09,955 --> 00:52:15,440
So if in a small team someone doesn't want to play ball or there's arguments and stuff.

697
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:34,971
I don't have a solution. I think when people argue, and people do argue sometimes, and I speak to them, it's never...

698
00:52:37,272 --> 00:52:40,774
I don't sit them in a room together and tell them what's what.

699
00:52:41,895 --> 00:52:46,877
Everyone's a responsible adult and they've got to work out a way to work together.

700
00:52:47,518 --> 00:52:50,319
As long as everyone has a good intention, it works.

701
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:58,224
If somebody fights against a model that says, I don't believe this can work, there's no

702
00:52:58,284 --> 00:52:58,444
way.

703
00:53:00,084 --> 00:53:01,825
I haven't found a solution to that.

704
00:53:02,605 --> 00:53:07,047
And inevitably, it leads to them not being on the project.

705
00:53:07,807 --> 00:53:10,047
I'm not a producer.

706
00:53:12,248 --> 00:53:14,849
I'm not a particularly good manager, I would say, as well.

707
00:53:15,149 --> 00:53:20,471
Like, I don't know if there's a better way to deal with it.

708
00:53:20,571 --> 00:53:23,572
But I haven't found a better way, is the honest answer.

709
00:53:26,493 --> 00:53:28,373
OK, let's take one more, and then we're done.

710
00:53:29,274 --> 00:53:30,256
We can go for some beers.

711
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:47,393
You mentioned that your system should be a role model for upcoming projects and other publishers.

712
00:53:47,953 --> 00:53:55,837
But your team has got huge experience in making video games and you've got specialists working on the game.

713
00:53:56,358 --> 00:54:01,580
How could this kind of a system work with indie gamers who don't have that much experience or...

714
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:13,540
I think what makes independent projects interesting is the subject, is the theme, is the hook.

715
00:54:14,961 --> 00:54:21,925
In our case, there's a very clear story-based, character-based differentiator, you could

716
00:54:21,965 --> 00:54:22,125
say.

717
00:54:23,106 --> 00:54:25,387
In other games, it's more mechanics-based.

718
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:29,710
I think with projects like, with platforms like UE4.

719
00:54:31,719 --> 00:54:35,701
You can make absolutely stunning, beautiful art

720
00:54:36,242 --> 00:54:39,264
without having to go for realism.

721
00:54:39,944 --> 00:54:41,866
I think the aesthetic is important,

722
00:54:42,466 --> 00:54:47,430
but it doesn't have to be an aesthetic that demands that level of...

723
00:54:49,802 --> 00:54:55,183
detail and work in it. We're doing that because it's one of our advantages of being experienced,

724
00:54:55,203 --> 00:55:00,004
so we're throwing every advantage we have out there. But I don't think this game could be said,

725
00:55:00,485 --> 00:55:06,586
for example, you couldn't say that this game is more beautiful than Journey. So there's a

726
00:55:06,626 --> 00:55:11,287
difference between the aesthetic and the production values that are needed to go,

727
00:55:11,407 --> 00:55:18,248
the production that needs to go into it. But make the idea special is the cool thing.

728
00:55:20,161 --> 00:55:21,451
All right, well, thank you very much.

729
00:55:21,532 --> 00:55:22,318
It's been a pleasure.
