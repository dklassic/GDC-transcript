1
00:00:06,641 --> 00:00:10,643
Thanks so much for coming along to this session today. It's a real honor and a

2
00:00:10,683 --> 00:00:15,244
privilege for me and Tameem to be here today. So I'm Dominic Matthews, I'm

3
00:00:15,304 --> 00:00:21,427
commercial director at Ninja Theory and I'm here with Tameem Antoniades who is

4
00:00:21,887 --> 00:00:26,589
one of the Ninja Theory co-founders and chief creative ninja at the studio. So

5
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:31,711
today we're going to talk to you about Hellblade Senua's Sacrifice which has

6
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:33,751
been an incredible journey for us.

7
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:39,293
It's really great to be able to be here today to share that journey with you.

8
00:00:42,115 --> 00:00:46,299
Please remember to evaluate the session, particularly if you think it's good.

9
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,062
If you don't think it's good, then don't bother.

10
00:00:52,464 --> 00:00:55,467
Cool, so we'll crack on with the presentation.

11
00:00:55,507 --> 00:00:57,629
So a bit about Ninja Theory first.

12
00:00:59,272 --> 00:01:01,613
We're a studio of about 100 people.

13
00:01:01,653 --> 00:01:03,094
We're based in Cambridge in the UK.

14
00:01:04,094 --> 00:01:07,195
And we've been making games for 18 years now.

15
00:01:09,976 --> 00:01:15,678
And over those years, we've created a number of titles,

16
00:01:15,698 --> 00:01:17,619
starting with Kung Fu Chaos back in 2003

17
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:21,160
for the original Xbox with Microsoft,

18
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:23,501
Heavenly Sword for the PlayStation 3 in 2007 with Sony.

19
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:29,952
Enslaved Odyssey to the West in 2010 with Namco Bandai.

20
00:01:31,213 --> 00:01:34,174
DMC Devil May Cry, the reboot of that franchise in 2013.

21
00:01:34,814 --> 00:01:37,135
And then the definitive edition of that in 2015.

22
00:01:37,455 --> 00:01:43,458
And we worked on Disney Infinity 3.0 in 2015 as well.

23
00:01:43,498 --> 00:01:45,859
So we created the starter play set for that, as well as

24
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:49,180
redesigning the entire combat system.

25
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:56,587
And then the title in question, last year on August the 8th we released

26
00:01:57,168 --> 00:02:03,978
Hellblade Senua's Sacrifice, which was our first independently funded and self-published title.

27
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:07,439
The game was sold at $29.99.

28
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:12,482
It was a PS4 and PC only title, a digital only title.

29
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:17,365
And it really focused on Ninja Theory DNA,

30
00:02:17,485 --> 00:02:20,047
that DNA that we've created over the last 15 years,

31
00:02:20,087 --> 00:02:24,369
which is really creating immersive worlds

32
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:26,251
and character-led stories

33
00:02:27,631 --> 00:02:30,813
and visceral, fluid combat gameplay.

34
00:02:32,183 --> 00:02:37,087
and combining all of those things to create an experience that really is what we see as

35
00:02:37,147 --> 00:02:39,349
pure ninja theory for ninja theory fans.

36
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:49,117
And it tells the story of Senua, a Celtic warrior, and her vision quest to find the

37
00:02:49,157 --> 00:02:55,082
soul of her lover, and it's a journey into psychosis, which, to me, we'll talk about

38
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:56,043
a bit more later.

39
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:00,349
But to kind of tell the Hellblade story from the beginning,

40
00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:01,890
we need to go back to 2014.

41
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:06,971
We just released DMC Devil May Cry.

42
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:12,593
And as a studio, we took a step back

43
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:18,974
and took a look at the market at that time and the game space.

44
00:03:19,795 --> 00:03:25,436
We tried to pitch a very big AAA game to publishers.

45
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:32,871
a game called Razor, which never, uh, was never greenlit. It was a big games as a service

46
00:03:32,911 --> 00:03:34,173
title. Um.

47
00:03:35,008 --> 00:03:40,651
And through that process, we really identified that the market had evolved into something

48
00:03:41,912 --> 00:03:53,857
where essentially middle tier, mid-sized developers like us making AAA games couldn't really survive.

49
00:03:53,877 --> 00:03:56,778
It was a difficult market for studios like us.

50
00:03:57,899 --> 00:03:59,179
This was really down to the...

51
00:04:01,828 --> 00:04:08,173
The AAA arms race as we see it, which is the fixed price of AAA games at retail of $60,

52
00:04:08,253 --> 00:04:18,140
has meant that developers and games can't compete on price and instead have to compete on size and

53
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:25,405
scale and scope. And this has meant that over the years games have got bigger and bigger and bigger.

54
00:04:26,312 --> 00:04:28,872
Development teams have got bigger and bigger and bigger.

55
00:04:29,412 --> 00:04:31,413
And of course, development costs have got bigger and

56
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:32,593
bigger and bigger too.

57
00:04:34,453 --> 00:04:38,874
And what that has meant is that many genres that have

58
00:04:39,275 --> 00:04:43,716
thrived in the AAA space in years gone by simply can't

59
00:04:43,796 --> 00:04:46,736
survive anymore because they can't appeal to enough people

60
00:04:46,816 --> 00:04:47,656
to be justified.

61
00:04:48,717 --> 00:04:53,158
Games at this level now need to appeal to not just 2

62
00:04:53,518 --> 00:04:55,538
million people or 3 million people.

63
00:04:56,719 --> 00:05:00,481
But now we're talking about 5, 6, 7, 8 million people.

64
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:06,025
And through the process of us talking to publishers

65
00:05:06,465 --> 00:05:11,769
about this big title that we were looking at,

66
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:17,413
and over the years we kind of came up with this checklist of tick boxes

67
00:05:17,513 --> 00:05:20,735
that titles now need to tick in order to survive in that space.

68
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:26,642
Things like, what's the season pass gonna look like?

69
00:05:26,662 --> 00:05:28,542
Well, you need to have multiplayer.

70
00:05:28,582 --> 00:05:30,322
Every game needs to have multiplayer now.

71
00:05:30,842 --> 00:05:33,743
Well, does your protagonist appeal to enough people?

72
00:05:34,483 --> 00:05:39,144
Is it a Caucasian male with stubble and a shaved head?

73
00:05:39,204 --> 00:05:41,604
Because, hey, that's what everyone's looking for

74
00:05:41,664 --> 00:05:42,225
these days.

75
00:05:42,445 --> 00:05:43,685
Yeah, just like me, yeah.

76
00:05:43,905 --> 00:05:44,205
Sorry.

77
00:05:44,225 --> 00:05:44,885
Yeah.

78
00:05:46,885 --> 00:05:47,065
Yeah.

79
00:05:47,786 --> 00:05:48,446
Thank you to me.

80
00:05:52,833 --> 00:06:02,879
And this kind of checklist culture in the AAA space has sadly meant that many genres

81
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:11,545
have disappeared at the AAA end, and unfortunately so too have the teams and the developers

82
00:06:11,645 --> 00:06:13,145
behind those types of games.

83
00:06:15,047 --> 00:06:17,508
And those developers have either disappeared altogether...

84
00:06:18,558 --> 00:06:22,519
They've had to move away from AAA development,

85
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,541
or they've had to go and do something else

86
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,182
completely different.

87
00:06:28,502 --> 00:06:30,823
And the list of studios that have disappeared

88
00:06:30,843 --> 00:06:32,964
between 2000 and 2017 is absolutely phenomenal.

89
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,712
And it's genres of games that I loved playing when I was younger,

90
00:06:46,732 --> 00:06:50,293
like Jet Set Radio and Parappa the Rapper and Aiko and Okami,

91
00:06:50,813 --> 00:06:55,815
all incredible games, high production values, incredibly creative,

92
00:06:57,396 --> 00:07:01,257
but just not mainstream enough to appeal to those millions and millions of people.

93
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:10,556
So for us as a studio, we felt that pinch in being in the situation where a team of

94
00:07:10,576 --> 00:07:15,279
a hundred people, we make games that people love.

95
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,941
We've got a fan base behind us.

96
00:07:19,142 --> 00:07:23,184
It's not huge, but it's a dedicated fan base that love what we do.

97
00:07:24,265 --> 00:07:29,169
But we were left with this choice of do we either ramp up our team and our studio,

98
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:35,313
triple our team size to make games that can appeal to those many, many, many millions of people

99
00:07:36,234 --> 00:07:42,158
and risk sacrificing our core values and our creativity, I think, in the process?

100
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:48,322
Or do we walk away from our, at that time, 15 years of development in the console business?

101
00:07:49,984 --> 00:07:51,805
And we didn't want to do either of those things.

102
00:07:54,144 --> 00:07:57,806
And that situation I think can be kind of summed up in this slide, which is

103
00:07:59,928 --> 00:08:05,832
players want creative games, players want the kind of games that creative developers make,

104
00:08:05,892 --> 00:08:08,253
the games that we at Ninja Theory make.

105
00:08:09,034 --> 00:08:12,156
And frankly, that's what we want to make.

106
00:08:12,196 --> 00:08:15,638
We're in the business of making the games that we want to make for the people that want them.

107
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:20,200
but there was a block on this, the AAA space wasn't allowing us to do that.

108
00:08:20,261 --> 00:08:24,704
So, we wanted to find another way.

109
00:08:24,724 --> 00:08:26,706
We didn't want to go big and we didn't want to go home.

110
00:08:26,746 --> 00:08:28,808
We wanted to find a third way.

111
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:35,674
And we identified in the market that there's really these two extremes.

112
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,236
On one side you have...

113
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:44,293
independent games where creativity is incredible.

114
00:08:44,853 --> 00:08:47,174
New genres are being created all the time.

115
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:54,956
But budgetary restrictions mean that quite often

116
00:08:55,516 --> 00:08:59,657
those small teams have to go down a route

117
00:08:59,697 --> 00:09:01,378
that isn't triple A production values.

118
00:09:02,718 --> 00:09:05,880
And then on the other side, in the blockbuster space,

119
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,923
games are getting bigger, the production values are phenomenal,

120
00:09:10,724 --> 00:09:13,626
and it's just incredible what's being achieved there.

121
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:21,251
But each of those games have to fit into very narrow genres,

122
00:09:22,012 --> 00:09:26,595
a small number of genres that can survive at that very top end.

123
00:09:27,256 --> 00:09:28,417
So these two extremes,

124
00:09:28,737 --> 00:09:31,639
but really nothing that sits in the middle of those two.

125
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,221
And this is the space that we called Independent AAA.

126
00:09:36,981 --> 00:09:40,142
And Independent AAA was about making AAA quality games,

127
00:09:42,323 --> 00:09:45,204
but that can be offered at lower flexible pricing, so

128
00:09:45,244 --> 00:09:50,486
that we can break away from that $60 retail model, make a

129
00:09:50,546 --> 00:09:54,127
game that we want to make, that is the scale and the

130
00:09:54,247 --> 00:09:56,208
scope that we want to make, and then price it

131
00:09:56,248 --> 00:09:56,788
appropriately.

132
00:09:57,848 --> 00:10:00,071
It's about having creative ownership.

133
00:10:01,773 --> 00:10:05,496
The independent freedom gives you self-publishing so we can

134
00:10:05,556 --> 00:10:07,799
build a direct relationship with our players.

135
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,003
And digital distribution is key to the model, too.

136
00:10:12,323 --> 00:10:15,967
It allows us to achieve higher margins per unit that we sell.

137
00:10:16,187 --> 00:10:17,068
It allows us to have

138
00:10:17,845 --> 00:10:23,947
price control, and it allows us to deliver our product to fans

139
00:10:24,187 --> 00:10:27,667
across the world, wherever they may be, without the need to

140
00:10:27,707 --> 00:10:31,788
have a huge sales and publishing and distribution

141
00:10:31,828 --> 00:10:34,249
team within our small studio.

142
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:41,030
So this started out as a concept for how we could break

143
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:44,591
through that AAA block, make AAA production.

144
00:10:46,235 --> 00:10:51,598
gains with AAA production values, but with a small team and with a small budget.

145
00:10:51,658 --> 00:10:54,840
So fundamentally, how did this change things for us?

146
00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:00,102
Well, the biggest thing is that we were looking at a far smaller budget than we'd worked with

147
00:11:01,043 --> 00:11:01,523
ever before.

148
00:11:01,923 --> 00:11:07,406
So this isn't indie budgets.

149
00:11:07,446 --> 00:11:10,628
This is something bigger than that, but it's certainly something far smaller than...

150
00:11:11,967 --> 00:11:13,927
We would normally work with for a AAA game,

151
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:16,208
and certainly far smaller than other AAA games

152
00:11:16,268 --> 00:11:19,269
are being made for in the current market.

153
00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:23,070
And the biggest cost in game development

154
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,670
is obviously your team.

155
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:29,832
So for us, we have a team of 100 people across Ninja Theory,

156
00:11:30,152 --> 00:11:31,972
and traditionally all of those people

157
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:33,533
have worked on one product.

158
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:37,454
But with Hellblade, we had a team of 20 people

159
00:11:37,754 --> 00:11:39,555
on the project across three years.

160
00:11:41,565 --> 00:11:46,008
So that meant that in many discipline areas, we had one person.

161
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:52,251
And we had to have, we had to be very innovative, and we had to be very creative in the way

162
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:56,854
in which we could deliver the quality and the quantity that we needed to, to make the

163
00:11:56,914 --> 00:12:00,816
experience that we had the vision for in Hellblade.

164
00:12:02,877 --> 00:12:04,398
And key to this really was...

165
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,522
having the mindset and the attitude that we would never sacrifice on quality

166
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:13,925
and it wasn't a question of can we do it, it was a question of

167
00:12:14,405 --> 00:12:14,965
how do we do it.

168
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:19,932
and a good example of that is in performance capture.

169
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:23,694
So performance capture is a technology and a technique

170
00:12:23,754 --> 00:12:27,517
that we've worked with since Heavenly Sword.

171
00:12:27,577 --> 00:12:29,238
It was a technology that we pioneered

172
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:30,499
on that project in video games.

173
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,922
And it's something that we strongly believe

174
00:12:35,282 --> 00:12:37,024
is the way in which you can realize

175
00:12:37,064 --> 00:12:40,126
the truest character performance in a game.

176
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,967
So on Hellblade, when we started the project,

177
00:12:43,548 --> 00:12:45,808
we knew that this was something that we wanted to

178
00:12:46,229 --> 00:12:47,869
not just utilize in Hellblade,

179
00:12:47,929 --> 00:12:50,030
but that we wanted to push further

180
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,331
and try and push the boundaries of what we could achieve,

181
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:54,292
but with our very small budget.

182
00:12:54,332 --> 00:12:58,273
So typically we would fly out to the US or to New Zealand

183
00:12:59,234 --> 00:13:02,415
to a purpose-built motion capture facility

184
00:13:02,935 --> 00:13:06,937
to shoot all of the scenes for our games.

185
00:13:08,231 --> 00:13:10,992
But with Hellblade that just wasn't possible within our budget.

186
00:13:11,072 --> 00:13:16,314
So the solution that we came up with was certainly the idea initially was,

187
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:19,515
well we've got our boardroom in the studio, which is our biggest meeting room.

188
00:13:20,856 --> 00:13:25,718
What about if we try and convert our boardroom into a motion capture studio?

189
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:29,320
And initially those conversations were quite difficult internally,

190
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,041
it was like, well, we still need to use it as a meeting room.

191
00:13:32,121 --> 00:13:33,621
It's like, okay, you can still have a table in there.

192
00:13:36,344 --> 00:13:38,647
Over time that table was moved out.

193
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:43,113
But I think it's a good example of our attitude, which was,

194
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:43,874
well, let's give it a go.

195
00:13:44,596 --> 00:13:47,219
Let's try and take a risk on this, and let's try and make

196
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,401
it work, and if it doesn't, we'll move

197
00:13:48,441 --> 00:13:49,282
on to another solution.

198
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:56,808
uh, we, uh, we went into that boardroom, um, uh, Balash, who's, uh, the cinematic lead on, on

199
00:13:56,928 --> 00:14:02,332
Hellblade, he, he drove to Ikea and bought wardrobe poles to mount our cameras on. We bought,

200
00:14:02,532 --> 00:14:07,936
um, uh, lighting from Amazon, so the light, the lights you can see in this, uh, video are, um,

201
00:14:08,536 --> 00:14:13,920
ceiling tile lights for, for offices from Amazon and they cost, uh, $50, $50 each, something in

202
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,580
that kind of region.

203
00:14:15,441 --> 00:14:18,682
We bought soundproofing curtains, we bought gym mats for the floor,

204
00:14:19,502 --> 00:14:25,163
and we worked with Vicon to try and find a solution and a way to have a camera set up

205
00:14:25,203 --> 00:14:26,884
that would work within our budget.

206
00:14:27,904 --> 00:14:33,606
And that turned out to be the space in which we shot all of our cinematics for Hellblade.

207
00:14:33,626 --> 00:14:38,527
So every scene that you see in Hellblade was shot in our boardroom in this room.

208
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:47,110
And an important point on this is that the quality of the data that we gained from this

209
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:50,952
was in line, if not better than anything we'd achieved before.

210
00:14:51,293 --> 00:14:56,896
And that's the important point, is that we weren't just, we weren't, the important point

211
00:14:56,976 --> 00:15:02,080
is that what comes across on screen is not in any way compromised.

212
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,581
If it was, we wouldn't have done this.

213
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:08,700
was trying to find a way that we could do it within our, within our budget and keep that

214
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:15,184
quality bar not just high but higher than it's ever been before for us at Ninja Theory. Um, so

215
00:15:15,204 --> 00:15:20,348
for comparison, um, obviously the cost we, that we had here were a fraction of what it cost for

216
00:15:20,408 --> 00:15:24,691
us to, um, you know, fly everyone out for a dedicated shoot. Uh, so, um, we, we, we, we

217
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:30,613
But we built our own in-house mocap space for what it would cost

218
00:15:30,633 --> 00:15:33,336
for around three or four days in an external studio.

219
00:15:34,077 --> 00:15:37,420
So it gave us quality, but it also gave us a huge amount of flexibility,

220
00:15:37,841 --> 00:15:41,084
and flexibility that we now wouldn't want to give up moving forward.

221
00:15:41,605 --> 00:15:52,211
So not only did we use this for all of our cinematics, but also it was a tool that our animators could use to go into that space at any time they wanted, jump in a mocap suit and try stuff out.

222
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:55,493
So throughout Hellblade, there's a lot of...

223
00:15:57,174 --> 00:16:01,115
a lot of detailed animation that Senua has in particular situations,

224
00:16:01,215 --> 00:16:03,235
so running through fire where she's coughing,

225
00:16:04,055 --> 00:16:06,016
balancing across beams,

226
00:16:06,096 --> 00:16:11,497
trying to visualize her different states of being within the game.

227
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,617
So hundreds and hundreds of animations that we have in there.

228
00:16:13,637 --> 00:16:15,237
And that was really only possible because

229
00:16:15,738 --> 00:16:17,298
just along the corridor in our boardroom

230
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:19,618
was a facility that our animators could go and use

231
00:16:20,038 --> 00:16:21,819
and they could experiment to try and find

232
00:16:22,619 --> 00:16:24,699
solutions to deliver that quality and detail

233
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:26,840
that we needed to tell Senua's story.

234
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:31,510
We also used that space for all of our VO recording.

235
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:35,891
And again, this was something that was incredibly

236
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:36,612
experimental.

237
00:16:36,712 --> 00:16:41,954
So what you can see here is us using a binaural microphone.

238
00:16:42,014 --> 00:16:44,575
So a binaural microphone is a microphone that

239
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:48,970
record sound in the same way that a human head hears it.

240
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,112
So it's a funny looking thing.

241
00:16:50,172 --> 00:16:52,394
It's a microphone with two rubber ears on the side

242
00:16:52,474 --> 00:16:54,576
that mimic the shadowing that your ears,

243
00:16:54,937 --> 00:16:58,140
particularly mine, do.

244
00:17:00,282 --> 00:17:00,783
So we could,

245
00:17:02,585 --> 00:17:05,287
this was a way for us to represent the voice hearing

246
00:17:05,348 --> 00:17:08,451
that as a player, you and Senil were experiencing

247
00:17:08,491 --> 00:17:09,212
throughout the journey.

248
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:14,970
So rather than us being cramped up in a recording studio,

249
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:18,851
we could use that entire space, put our binaural microphone in the middle

250
00:17:18,931 --> 00:17:24,072
and have physical performers, theatre performers, perform around that microphone

251
00:17:24,092 --> 00:17:27,893
to bring some real physicality to that audio.

252
00:17:27,953 --> 00:17:31,134
So again, cost-saving, we could do everything in-house,

253
00:17:31,154 --> 00:17:33,855
we could bring our actors in, but it allowed us to be more experimental too.

254
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:40,432
Jeff, who is our character artist on the project,

255
00:17:40,912 --> 00:17:44,073
had the task of creating all of our enemies.

256
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:48,275
So an approach that he took was to use a handheld scanner

257
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:53,357
to capture both textures and geometry,

258
00:17:53,757 --> 00:17:55,437
base level textures and geometry

259
00:17:55,477 --> 00:17:56,938
for which he can build on top of.

260
00:17:57,018 --> 00:18:00,179
So we use this for anatomy,

261
00:18:00,219 --> 00:18:02,940
but we also use this for things like textiles.

262
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:10,362
And this was just a good way of deriving realism, high level of realism, but it didn't mean

263
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:13,843
that Jeff had to go in there and by hand create all of this stuff from scratch.

264
00:18:13,883 --> 00:18:15,644
He had a good base to work from.

265
00:18:15,744 --> 00:18:21,926
So again, using technology, off-the-shelf technology in this case, in a clever way to

266
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:24,267
achieve quality and quantity.

267
00:18:25,432 --> 00:18:27,374
And really the same with environment.

268
00:18:27,394 --> 00:18:29,976
So Dan Atwell, our lead environment artist on the

269
00:18:30,016 --> 00:18:33,220
project, giving the responsibilities of delivering

270
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,582
all of the Hellblade world.

271
00:18:35,602 --> 00:18:38,945
And his approach was to use a kit part based approach to the

272
00:18:38,965 --> 00:18:39,446
environment.

273
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:44,371
So what you can see in this shot here is, on the left is

274
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:48,865
all of the assets that are used to create this environment in the screenshot.

275
00:18:48,925 --> 00:18:53,669
So, his focus was to create a small number of very high quality assets

276
00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:59,133
and focus his time on that, and then use them in clever ways to create the world.

277
00:18:59,233 --> 00:19:06,538
So, just using these trees and these rocks in different ways,

278
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:10,741
sinking them into the ground, painting over them with moss, these types of things.

279
00:19:11,702 --> 00:19:17,490
He could create a very high quality, varied environment

280
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:21,375
without the need to create a huge amount of bespoke content.

281
00:19:23,898 --> 00:19:26,201
And this was one that was quite late on in the project.

282
00:19:29,698 --> 00:19:33,621
Given what we were doing with characters in the project,

283
00:19:33,681 --> 00:19:34,782
we have a focus on characters,

284
00:19:34,802 --> 00:19:36,804
but we always knew that Senua was the real focus.

285
00:19:36,824 --> 00:19:39,647
We wanted to make her the most realistic real-time character

286
00:19:39,687 --> 00:19:40,668
that anyone had ever seen.

287
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:46,833
But to me, always held onto this idea

288
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:49,396
that maybe we could visualize the characters in another way.

289
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:49,456
So.

290
00:19:52,867 --> 00:19:56,849
And to me, his idea was to use live action, which of course,

291
00:19:57,709 --> 00:19:59,930
given the track record of live action in games,

292
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:03,511
the entire team was incredibly on board with from day one.

293
00:20:05,432 --> 00:20:07,112
Raised a few eyebrows, but again, it

294
00:20:07,132 --> 00:20:09,113
was the attitude of, well, let's give it a go.

295
00:20:09,273 --> 00:20:11,214
And if it's going to fail, let's fail quick and move on

296
00:20:11,234 --> 00:20:12,294
to an alternative solution.

297
00:20:12,934 --> 00:20:19,940
So when we were shooting some of the VO, we had a friend who was a costume designer create costumes for the actors.

298
00:20:20,281 --> 00:20:22,422
We shot them on green screen and we got them into the game.

299
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:27,787
Got those shots into the game as quickly as possible to try and see if we could make it work.

300
00:20:27,867 --> 00:20:30,509
And it worked. It worked really well.

301
00:20:32,086 --> 00:20:36,850
The first time we showed this to anyone was actually when Game Informer came over to visit

302
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:37,450
the studio.

303
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:42,455
And we just got into the game and we just got the final treatment in there.

304
00:20:42,695 --> 00:20:45,417
We showed them one of these scenes without telling them that it was live action.

305
00:20:45,457 --> 00:20:48,320
We all kind of sat there and thought, are they going to notice?

306
00:20:49,851 --> 00:20:57,320
and they didn't. So we thought that was a job well done. So, again, an example of, you know,

307
00:20:57,741 --> 00:21:01,145
let's challenge the way things have always been done. Yes, live action hasn't traditionally

308
00:21:01,165 --> 00:21:04,409
worked in games, but let's see if we can make it work for Hellblade, and we did.

309
00:21:05,413 --> 00:21:10,436
So there's some examples of really how we delivered high

310
00:21:10,476 --> 00:21:12,697
quality in the game with creativity and with

311
00:21:12,717 --> 00:21:15,739
innovation, but also key to, I think, what we've achieved on

312
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:18,961
Hellblade was not just development within the budget,

313
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:22,964
but also marketing and engaging people in the game

314
00:21:23,184 --> 00:21:24,144
within budget as well.

315
00:21:24,645 --> 00:21:25,605
And our approach was to

316
00:21:27,465 --> 00:21:30,750
to try and engage players at a deeper level than just showing them a trailer.

317
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,995
And that was to announce the game early, very early.

318
00:21:34,035 --> 00:21:35,076
Look how young I look there.

319
00:21:35,096 --> 00:21:35,858
Full of hope.

320
00:21:35,898 --> 00:21:35,938
Um.

321
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:36,038
Yeah.

322
00:21:36,478 --> 00:21:36,559
Yeah.

323
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:36,679
Yeah.

324
00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:36,799
Yeah.

325
00:21:36,819 --> 00:21:36,899
Yeah.

326
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:36,999
Yeah.

327
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:37,119
Yeah.

328
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:37,280
Yeah.

329
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:37,380
Yeah.

330
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:37,500
Yeah.

331
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:37,600
Yeah.

332
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:37,941
Yeah.

333
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:38,041
Yeah.

334
00:21:38,061 --> 00:21:38,161
Yeah.

335
00:21:38,181 --> 00:21:38,261
Yeah.

336
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:39,663
Yeah.

337
00:21:39,683 --> 00:21:39,763
Yeah.

338
00:21:39,783 --> 00:21:39,863
Yeah.

339
00:21:41,406 --> 00:21:46,370
So we announced the game really at the very beginning of the project, three years before launch,

340
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:54,596
and we told the story, warts and all, in a very open and honest way through 30 development diaries throughout the project.

341
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:59,779
And we told the story of the ups and the downs and everything that we were trying in the game,

342
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:05,464
and through that process we not only created a fan base behind Hellblade, but we created...

343
00:22:06,304 --> 00:22:10,387
evangelists and people that wanted to tell people about the game, tell people

344
00:22:11,908 --> 00:22:17,672
about our journey. And how that really kind of tangibly manifested was that when we announced

345
00:22:17,952 --> 00:22:23,216
our pre-order and went into pre-order, we got pre-order numbers way beyond our expectations

346
00:22:23,276 --> 00:22:26,779
and we were able to use that revenue from pre-order.

347
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:31,002
to drive a larger marketing campaign at launch.

348
00:22:31,082 --> 00:22:34,304
So it was by kind of mobilizing that community,

349
00:22:34,844 --> 00:22:36,485
bringing them on board early,

350
00:22:36,505 --> 00:22:39,107
and treating them with respect

351
00:22:39,187 --> 00:22:42,630
and giving them an insight into what our journey was,

352
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,172
that they repaid us with their faith,

353
00:22:45,492 --> 00:22:47,853
not just by pre-ordering the game

354
00:22:47,893 --> 00:22:49,555
and helping us with our marketing budget,

355
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:53,898
but really evangelizing the game to their own communities too.

356
00:22:55,699 --> 00:22:55,819
So.

357
00:22:57,348 --> 00:23:04,433
To sum up my section, keys to independent AAA, flexible, lower pricing, breaking away

358
00:23:04,513 --> 00:23:10,517
from that $60 retail model to offer a game that is smaller in scope, is no less high

359
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:13,779
quality but can be offered at a value price.

360
00:23:14,844 --> 00:23:19,426
Keeping your budget low, predominantly through team size but through innovation to keep that

361
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:24,047
break even low so that you can make games for smaller niche audiences.

362
00:23:24,087 --> 00:23:28,509
You don't have to make a game that appeals to five plus million people and the creative

363
00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:30,189
sacrifices that come with that.

364
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:36,692
Building community, having a direct relationship with your fans and being honest, being open

365
00:23:36,732 --> 00:23:41,673
with them, giving them the opportunity to be part of your journey, making them believe

366
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:44,094
in what you believe, not just selling them a game.

367
00:23:46,442 --> 00:23:48,684
And finally, having a creative focus.

368
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:52,609
Much of the structure of Independent AAA is about

369
00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:56,173
allowing the creative team to have that focus and that

370
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:58,215
freedom to tell the story that they want to.

371
00:23:59,536 --> 00:24:01,899
And I'll hand over to Tameem to talk about that story and

372
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,821
that journey that we decided to tell in Hellblade.

373
00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:16,089
Thanks, Tom.

374
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:23,917
So I always get asked what gave you the idea to do Hellblade.

375
00:24:24,737 --> 00:24:27,000
And when I think of truly original fantasy,

376
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,342
I think of Lord of the Rings, 1984, Blade Runner,

377
00:24:29,982 --> 00:24:30,863
Night of the Living Dead.

378
00:24:30,943 --> 00:24:34,987
Obviously, fantasy goes way further back, Gilgamesh

379
00:24:35,027 --> 00:24:36,949
and Beowulf, what have you.

380
00:24:37,953 --> 00:24:44,978
I'd say most popular fantasy today is a derivation of those popular movies or books.

381
00:24:45,958 --> 00:24:53,923
And I didn't want to do that because they also come with their own set of rules and

382
00:24:53,963 --> 00:24:57,786
baggage and expectations that have been built up over time.

383
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:01,748
So I really did want to make something original.

384
00:25:02,846 --> 00:25:06,169
a game that wasn't derived from those well-trodden tropes,

385
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,492
and to find something that felt a bit more grounded.

386
00:25:09,933 --> 00:25:14,537
And I thought, fantasy comes from the mind, so why not go to the source?

387
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:20,283
And a frightening, a very frightening and extreme example of what the mind

388
00:25:20,503 --> 00:25:24,847
is capable of creating can be found in psychotic mental illness.

389
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:31,593
And at the time it sounded dangerous, perhaps even reckless, to broach that subject.

390
00:25:32,354 --> 00:25:39,276
But I do truly believe that the power of fantasy comes from its ability to help further understanding through allegory.

391
00:25:40,636 --> 00:25:44,737
A fantasy is able to break down prejudices and assumptions,

392
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:50,259
because you have to open your mind to these worlds in order to accept and enjoy them.

393
00:25:52,389 --> 00:25:55,374
So the idea was born that Hellblade would be a classic hero's journey,

394
00:25:55,414 --> 00:25:59,341
but one where the fantasy world is a construct of Senua's mind.

395
00:25:59,361 --> 00:26:00,863
So that's sort of where it began.

396
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,601
So just to cover what psychosis is,

397
00:26:12,602 --> 00:26:15,963
psychosis is a set of other symptoms

398
00:26:16,003 --> 00:26:17,584
and it can be caused by various causes,

399
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:20,905
smoking pot, schizophrenia,

400
00:26:21,005 --> 00:26:22,886
you know, there's a multitude of causes.

401
00:26:24,086 --> 00:26:27,468
But it's about losing contact with reality

402
00:26:27,508 --> 00:26:31,329
and it often manifests itself with visions and voices

403
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:33,130
and strange beliefs and delusions.

404
00:26:38,171 --> 00:26:39,031
Oh, excuse me.

405
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:50,516
So, Senua can be described as having a severe psychotic mental illness.

406
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:53,837
And it is a subject that is taboo for sure.

407
00:26:54,337 --> 00:27:00,180
And where it does feature, it's usually in the form of like the serial killer, you know,

408
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,481
or the plot twist at the end where nothing was real, it was all a dream.

409
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:05,042
Ah ha ha! You know, that's the, you know.

410
00:27:06,022 --> 00:27:06,502
I find that...

411
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:09,215
both those aspects quite frustrating.

412
00:27:10,176 --> 00:27:13,100
So why is it not represented directly in more honesty in fiction?

413
00:27:13,821 --> 00:27:16,884
I think for one, we don't actually know

414
00:27:16,904 --> 00:27:19,647
a lot about it from a scientific point of view.

415
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:24,774
Compared to physical illnesses and conditions, we're way behind when it

416
00:27:24,794 --> 00:27:26,015
comes to mental conditions.

417
00:27:27,099 --> 00:27:30,161
I mean, we're not taught about, if you think about it, we're not taught about the mind

418
00:27:30,221 --> 00:27:33,583
like in school, like we are taught about biology.

419
00:27:33,663 --> 00:27:38,225
So we all grow up ignorant about what the mind is, how it functions.

420
00:27:40,133 --> 00:27:45,515
I also think that a lot of creators think that this is dangerous territory.

421
00:27:45,815 --> 00:27:50,396
It's a Pandora's box that once opened will open you up to savage critical attacks

422
00:27:51,617 --> 00:27:53,037
that will expose your ignorance.

423
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:57,179
This is something that I very much feared at the start of the project.

424
00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:01,820
I have no qualms with admitting that I was ignorant on the subject.

425
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:08,556
And if you were around for DMC, you'd know that, like, you know,

426
00:28:09,057 --> 00:28:13,919
savage critical attacks is something we've sort of had to deal with before.

427
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:17,941
So we weren't that afraid of dealing that if it would come.

428
00:28:19,942 --> 00:28:24,024
But creatively, what excited me was it was a path least trodden.

429
00:28:24,345 --> 00:28:28,287
I mean, I think that's what I was looking for.

430
00:28:28,367 --> 00:28:31,468
Just something different, something new, a chance to.

431
00:28:33,173 --> 00:28:37,354
show you what it might be like to experience the world through the mind of someone who

432
00:28:37,414 --> 00:28:38,555
experiences psychosis.

433
00:28:40,795 --> 00:28:46,477
It felt interesting, intellectually exciting, creatively, but I had to learn.

434
00:28:46,637 --> 00:28:47,758
The whole team had to learn.

435
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:50,859
So how did we learn?

436
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:58,221
Well, Dom went to Google and found Paul Fletcher, professor of health neuroscience and psychiatrist

437
00:28:58,241 --> 00:29:00,902
at the University of Cambridge, and sent him an email.

438
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:08,714
He also got in touch with Wellcome, Wellcome Trust, which is a massive charity organization

439
00:29:09,155 --> 00:29:17,823
that deals with health. And they've often, Wellcome often provides grants for like arts

440
00:29:17,843 --> 00:29:24,929
projects and films, so we were hoping that, you know, with these, with their assistance,

441
00:29:25,009 --> 00:29:26,471
you know, they could open doors for us.

442
00:29:28,052 --> 00:29:34,135
So Paul and representatives of Wellcome met us, grilled us.

443
00:29:34,596 --> 00:29:37,237
We had to do a good amount of presentations to them.

444
00:29:38,158 --> 00:29:40,999
And once they came on board, they

445
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:43,801
came on board fully for the full three years of development.

446
00:29:44,982 --> 00:29:49,004
They involved other clinicians and experts, Professor Charles

447
00:29:49,044 --> 00:29:52,867
Fernyhugh, an expert in voice hearing, lots of people

448
00:29:52,907 --> 00:29:55,288
with lived experience of psychosis.

449
00:29:56,809 --> 00:30:02,692
from Recovery College East in Cambridge and the Voice Collective, various other researchers and advisors.

450
00:30:03,412 --> 00:30:07,074
So they didn't just open doors, they really did blow the doors off.

451
00:30:08,295 --> 00:30:09,596
And I really would like to share what...

452
00:30:10,637 --> 00:30:14,259
the insights that we've had on this, because I think it's important, not just from a game

453
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:21,442
development point of view, I think it's just a fascinating subject, so I'm sorry if it's

454
00:30:21,822 --> 00:30:24,123
slightly off the game developer's track.

455
00:30:24,983 --> 00:30:31,465
But this key insight that I learned, which is that we only really see the shadows of

456
00:30:31,525 --> 00:30:34,266
reality, is what underpins the whole of...

457
00:30:35,076 --> 00:30:37,199
the creative efforts in Hellblade.

458
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:41,103
We like to think that we are objective, seeing the world as it is, but

459
00:30:41,824 --> 00:30:45,108
we are so far removed from objective reality that the whole concept

460
00:30:45,608 --> 00:30:46,790
is almost meaningless.

461
00:30:47,771 --> 00:30:49,813
And of course this is not a particularly new insight,

462
00:30:50,955 --> 00:30:53,538
as attested by Plato's allegory of the cave.

463
00:30:54,897 --> 00:30:57,939
And for those who are not familiar, the idea is that a bunch of people are in a cave

464
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:03,184
and they're set up such that they can only see the projected shadows of people in the real world.

465
00:31:04,245 --> 00:31:08,829
And so they form their own strange interpretation of how this world functions

466
00:31:10,091 --> 00:31:14,715
until one of them breaks free and then sees the real world and then rushes back and tells them what it actually is like.

467
00:31:14,755 --> 00:31:18,518
And of course they think he's insane. It doesn't make sense to any of them.

468
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,081
And so...

469
00:31:23,527 --> 00:31:25,328
This insight really does apply to us.

470
00:31:25,408 --> 00:31:27,369
I mean, we only see shadows.

471
00:31:27,389 --> 00:31:29,190
I mean, if you consider vision, light

472
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:33,292
is a narrow spectrum of the electromagnetic spectrum.

473
00:31:33,832 --> 00:31:36,694
It's actually a 10 trillionth of the electromagnetic spectrum.

474
00:31:36,734 --> 00:31:41,216
That's how we define color and objects and concepts like race.

475
00:31:41,376 --> 00:31:43,317
Like we create our own reality just

476
00:31:43,337 --> 00:31:48,520
from that sliver of what we see out there in the universe.

477
00:31:49,829 --> 00:31:52,069
And we don't even experience the world in real time.

478
00:31:52,109 --> 00:31:54,270
So from the time you click your fingers

479
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,170
to understanding what you've just done

480
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:58,211
or what you've just seen can take half a second.

481
00:31:58,871 --> 00:32:01,711
And our visual processing and our auditory processing

482
00:32:01,971 --> 00:32:03,711
happens at different speeds, so it's not in sync.

483
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:06,352
So somehow our brain just manages

484
00:32:06,412 --> 00:32:10,333
to amass all this noisy, unreliable information

485
00:32:10,433 --> 00:32:13,793
and create a reality for us so that we can function.

486
00:32:20,754 --> 00:32:26,058
So, we feel like we are in a world that is fully 3D present with us at the center

487
00:32:26,078 --> 00:32:27,359
and we call this objective reality.

488
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:31,243
And our mind is able to construct this fallacy of objectivity,

489
00:32:31,263 --> 00:32:33,145
a simulation of the world no less,

490
00:32:33,645 --> 00:32:36,588
based on everything we have experienced since birth.

491
00:32:37,268 --> 00:32:41,392
So, if you have wondered whether you are living in a simulation,

492
00:32:41,892 --> 00:32:43,774
I think one answer has to be yes.

493
00:32:44,014 --> 00:32:46,416
We are living in a simulation of our own mind's making.

494
00:32:49,117 --> 00:32:50,358
And so what does this mean?

495
00:32:53,579 --> 00:32:56,040
It means that we don't passively perceive a world.

496
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,121
We don't just receive a world and our eyes see it.

497
00:32:59,201 --> 00:33:00,782
We actually hallucinate the world.

498
00:33:00,822 --> 00:33:02,503
In our every day, every second of every day,

499
00:33:02,583 --> 00:33:05,084
we are actually hallucinating a simulation of a world

500
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:06,765
that our brain creates for us.

501
00:33:08,097 --> 00:33:13,239
Just think of moments when you were fearful at night and maybe you could see shapes and

502
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:18,102
shadows or when you're really angry and you're red with rage, how you interpret what people

503
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:21,503
say or the kind of grey lethargic world of grief.

504
00:33:21,663 --> 00:33:28,226
I mean these are all, the world looks different depending on how, on your state of mind.

505
00:33:32,601 --> 00:33:36,625
So in this context, it becomes easier to conceive of scenarios where our mind, with its endless

506
00:33:36,665 --> 00:33:40,529
adaptive feedback loops, can divert from the standard we term normality.

507
00:33:40,989 --> 00:33:46,595
And what we see in a psychotic mind is often a deconstruction, a separation of the fundamental

508
00:33:46,635 --> 00:33:51,720
relationships between sight, sound, senses, concepts, belief, even flow of time.

509
00:33:53,121 --> 00:33:56,962
And once we understood and accepted that we do not see through our eyes,

510
00:33:57,022 --> 00:33:59,523
but create worlds through our mind's eye,

511
00:33:59,803 --> 00:34:03,084
we had a model of reality that we could then start to deconstruct.

512
00:34:04,024 --> 00:34:07,386
And combined with the real lived experiences of people with psychosis,

513
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:12,387
we had a powerful coming together of science, art, and human experience.

514
00:34:13,407 --> 00:34:16,268
So this was the eureka moment for me, the mind's eye.

515
00:34:16,328 --> 00:34:18,129
But what does this mean practically?

516
00:34:20,887 --> 00:34:24,631
It means we are not seeing this game through the lens of a cameraman.

517
00:34:24,991 --> 00:34:27,273
It means we're not hearing the music from the composer

518
00:34:27,674 --> 00:34:29,876
or seeing the editor's handiwork in the cutscenes.

519
00:34:30,977 --> 00:34:32,859
Everything has to feel subjective,

520
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:37,144
as it would feel, look and sound to Senua through Hermione's eye.

521
00:34:39,762 --> 00:34:46,367
We like to think that we experience the world almost like a high definition photograph as it really is.

522
00:34:46,447 --> 00:34:52,351
But actually a lot of the time what we're doing is using what we already know to shape and govern what we perceive.

523
00:34:52,652 --> 00:34:55,754
You know, if we recognize that principle of how the brain functions,

524
00:34:55,814 --> 00:35:00,637
it may be that we can begin to understand what happens in the context of psychosis,

525
00:35:00,697 --> 00:35:06,041
because psychosis can't really easily be understood as just some malfunction of the mind.

526
00:35:06,101 --> 00:35:09,083
It's actually a very creative process where somebody constructs a world.

527
00:35:10,634 --> 00:35:16,480
So that's Professor Paul Fletcher, who I consider a mentor and guru

528
00:35:17,301 --> 00:35:18,562
throughout the course of this development.

529
00:35:18,822 --> 00:35:21,545
That's why his name comes up first in the credits,

530
00:35:21,585 --> 00:35:26,670
because he was that fundamental to our understanding of how the mind works,

531
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:29,473
the neuroscience behind it, the experiences behind it,

532
00:35:30,113 --> 00:35:34,117
and he helped shape the development of the project in a deep and fundamental way.

533
00:35:37,364 --> 00:35:39,486
So to break it down, visual perception.

534
00:35:40,006 --> 00:35:42,208
We did meet with Recovery College East

535
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:45,210
to speak to people with lived experience of psychosis

536
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,351
regularly throughout the project.

537
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:50,273
And they became our mental health advisors.

538
00:35:50,894 --> 00:35:54,436
Combined with the knowledge of psychiatric conditions

539
00:35:54,456 --> 00:35:58,459
that Paul had come across, we did a rapid prototyping phase

540
00:35:58,479 --> 00:36:01,742
in the project where we took their experiences,

541
00:36:01,782 --> 00:36:04,984
their described experiences, and we mocked it up in Unreal.

542
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:12,524
So this is sort of a little video where we have quotes from people and then we've iterated

543
00:36:12,544 --> 00:36:15,806
it in Unreal to try and represent those ideas.

544
00:36:16,086 --> 00:36:22,130
And we invited them back in to have a look at what we've done and then they would tell

545
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:24,291
us, oh that feels a bit awful, that doesn't feel right.

546
00:36:24,771 --> 00:36:28,734
Obviously everyone's experience is unique but there did seem to be enough of a common

547
00:36:28,794 --> 00:36:35,198
thread amongst them that we could really refine the visual perceptual representations in the

548
00:36:35,218 --> 00:36:35,418
game.

549
00:36:37,467 --> 00:36:41,048
So yeah, it's the classic iterative process we all use in games, but instead of applying

550
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:44,590
it to mechanics, we're applying it to people's lived experience.

551
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,233
So the camera viewpoint.

552
00:36:51,673 --> 00:36:56,555
I think one thing that struck me is that our mind's eye doesn't always see in the first

553
00:36:56,595 --> 00:36:56,835
person.

554
00:36:56,855 --> 00:37:00,297
If you think about memory, sometimes you see yourself in the third person and it's quite

555
00:37:00,337 --> 00:37:01,517
easy to sit there where you are.

556
00:37:02,985 --> 00:37:05,707
and project yourself so that you're looking at the back of your head.

557
00:37:05,827 --> 00:37:08,609
And then when you remember that memory, you remember looking at the back of your head.

558
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:12,151
It's quite a strange concept.

559
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:19,056
And I thought the third-person camera view actually could be used to give you a feeling of disassociation,

560
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:22,138
which for some people is a real thing, where

561
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:25,201
they just don't feel like they live inside their own skin.

562
00:37:25,741 --> 00:37:27,402
They feel like strangers in their own skin.

563
00:37:30,534 --> 00:37:35,336
So, this would mean letting go of standard film theory and camera cuts.

564
00:37:35,376 --> 00:37:38,778
The game would be just one continuous uncomfortable shot.

565
00:37:39,598 --> 00:37:43,400
Whether it's cutscene or gameplay, it would also mean that there would be no health bars,

566
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:48,203
no hit points, no inventory, no tutorials, nothing that would break you out of the idea

567
00:37:48,243 --> 00:37:52,645
that you're fully immersed in this world as an observer, as part of Senua's psyche, and

568
00:37:52,665 --> 00:37:53,786
a participant.

569
00:37:54,126 --> 00:37:57,208
You are her mind's eye, a watchful mind's eye.

570
00:38:00,219 --> 00:38:06,104
It also helped with the budget because now we only needed one camera person and the mo-cow

571
00:38:06,124 --> 00:38:10,688
space could track one person a lot better than three camera people which is what we

572
00:38:10,748 --> 00:38:11,268
normally use.

573
00:38:14,711 --> 00:38:16,973
So the flashbacks were also interesting.

574
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:20,116
One of our mental health advisors described vividly how she experiences them.

575
00:38:20,556 --> 00:38:23,338
To her, she would see the flashback appear around her forming.

576
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:27,397
from something that might start off unclear,

577
00:38:27,837 --> 00:38:29,218
and then she would get drawn in

578
00:38:29,278 --> 00:38:31,159
and start to relive that experience.

579
00:38:31,179 --> 00:38:33,161
So it's not like films where you get lots of fast cuts.

580
00:38:33,801 --> 00:38:37,163
It was more like you're just sucked into a new reality.

581
00:38:37,243 --> 00:38:38,824
And I could relate to that somewhat.

582
00:38:38,864 --> 00:38:41,586
So if you think of times where you're dreaming

583
00:38:42,006 --> 00:38:43,787
and then your dream just transitions

584
00:38:43,827 --> 00:38:45,728
from one moment to another seamlessly,

585
00:38:45,748 --> 00:38:46,469
and you're just drawn in,

586
00:38:46,489 --> 00:38:49,591
you're not aware of how it happens.

587
00:38:49,631 --> 00:38:51,012
It just does happen.

588
00:38:53,662 --> 00:38:59,167
The flashbacks that appear in the game all appear in the, all the story scenes in fact,

589
00:38:59,347 --> 00:39:02,150
the main story scenes appear as flashbacks.

590
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:08,776
They appear non-linearly, they're largely in reverse chronological order, and my fear

591
00:39:08,996 --> 00:39:11,218
was that this would be terribly confusing.

592
00:39:11,959 --> 00:39:16,303
But when you think about memories, you don't think about memories in a linear chronological

593
00:39:16,383 --> 00:39:18,585
order, you think about the moments that define your life.

594
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:24,434
that's what matters, the impact those moments, those scenes in your life experience have on you.

595
00:39:25,474 --> 00:39:26,715
So that's how they appear in the game.

596
00:39:28,517 --> 00:39:31,299
And I really was not sure if people would get the story,

597
00:39:31,339 --> 00:39:35,482
whether it would just be an incomprehensible mess by the end of it.

598
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:40,366
But I think it actually did come across as quite natural to a lot of people.

599
00:39:40,386 --> 00:39:45,790
They didn't need to see the links between the time period between these events.

600
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:47,731
They just got an insight into...

601
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,742
the moments that shaped Senua's life.

602
00:39:52,842 --> 00:39:57,144
And this is another example of how the game was more reflective of our mind's eye than

603
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:59,965
reflective of film narrative constructs.

604
00:40:04,567 --> 00:40:07,768
And the voices are the most immediate experience that hits you.

605
00:40:08,369 --> 00:40:11,270
I didn't have any clue what people who hear voices hear.

606
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:16,013
chances are you know people that do hear voices.

607
00:40:16,093 --> 00:40:19,874
It's apparently one in 10 of us experience it at some point in our lives.

608
00:40:21,635 --> 00:40:26,716
Wellcome introduced us to Professor Paul, sorry, getting all my professors wrong,

609
00:40:27,376 --> 00:40:30,637
Professor Charles Fernie, who's a leading expert in voice hearing,

610
00:40:30,657 --> 00:40:34,378
and he in turn put us in touch with a group of people called the Voice Collective.

611
00:40:35,258 --> 00:40:40,579
And we heard first hand from these people, you know, what these voices are like.

612
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:41,939
And it was quite a revelation.

613
00:40:43,622 --> 00:40:48,126
to have the opportunity to speak to, in particular, a couple of young voice

614
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:52,510
hearers at our studio. The term mentally ill just never came across our minds

615
00:40:52,530 --> 00:41:02,520
when talking to them. It clearly did not apply to them. And I really felt

616
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,043
their frustration because they don't consider themselves mentally ill.

617
00:41:06,123 --> 00:41:06,884
They hear voices.

618
00:41:08,921 --> 00:41:13,606
they endure quite a lot of frustration and stigma on a daily basis because of this fact.

619
00:41:14,687 --> 00:41:18,632
And this is why a lot of these mental health advisors were keen to work with us on this game.

620
00:41:18,652 --> 00:41:22,676
They wanted to show what it's like for them, or at least give a taste of what it's like for them.

621
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:28,060
Anyway, when it comes to the voices, they said that they were all around them in 3D.

622
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,801
Sometimes they're in very specific positions.

623
00:41:32,361 --> 00:41:33,841
Sometimes they speak in fragments.

624
00:41:33,921 --> 00:41:35,061
Sometimes they're distorted.

625
00:41:35,101 --> 00:41:36,482
Sometimes they're different languages.

626
00:41:37,582 --> 00:41:41,203
Sometimes they're fully fleshed characters that they've grown up with from childhood

627
00:41:42,363 --> 00:41:46,204
that they might consider long-trusted friends or foes.

628
00:41:48,418 --> 00:41:54,740
And the binaural microphone is the best way to represent 3D spatial audio in that manner.

629
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:01,522
So that's what we used to try and iterate on the voices with our physical theatre actors

630
00:42:01,562 --> 00:42:05,183
to try and get closer and closer and closer to what their experience was like.

631
00:42:05,584 --> 00:42:12,426
Now, this is another interesting decision we made, you know, because the idea that you

632
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:18,068
would make a game that's designed for headphones, you know, wouldn't wash as a AAA game.

633
00:42:20,046 --> 00:42:23,827
But our goal was to create Senua's Mind's Eye,

634
00:42:24,307 --> 00:42:25,388
create her experience.

635
00:42:26,228 --> 00:42:30,609
And that's why we asked players to put on a set of headphones

636
00:42:30,629 --> 00:42:32,790
when they played the game, at the start of the game.

637
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:34,370
And it worked.

638
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:38,671
Like people, the first thing, or one of the main things

639
00:42:38,711 --> 00:42:40,332
that people say when they recommend our game

640
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:42,533
is you have to play it with headphones.

641
00:42:42,733 --> 00:42:45,253
It's such a fundamental part of the experience.

642
00:42:47,248 --> 00:42:48,769
So I like that.

643
00:42:49,009 --> 00:42:52,631
It's given me a lot of trust in our audience, the idea that

644
00:42:53,911 --> 00:42:56,252
people really do want to experience new things.

645
00:42:56,593 --> 00:43:02,475
And we don't have to fit the lowest common denominator.

646
00:43:02,515 --> 00:43:04,676
We can create an experience that people come to.

647
00:43:04,836 --> 00:43:05,277
That was great.

648
00:43:12,469 --> 00:43:17,790
Right, so the implications of unreliable reality go far, far deeper than visual and auditory.

649
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:22,471
I mean, our neurons don't make a distinction between what we see, hear, touch, feel, think,

650
00:43:22,531 --> 00:43:23,011
and believe.

651
00:43:23,131 --> 00:43:27,732
So those fun optical illusions and things that we see online, the mental gymnastics

652
00:43:27,752 --> 00:43:32,733
that underpin them, applies to pretty much everything that occurs within our brain.

653
00:43:34,274 --> 00:43:39,675
It applies to our belief systems, to our thoughts, to the way we see people, the way we see the

654
00:43:39,715 --> 00:43:39,935
world.

655
00:43:42,254 --> 00:43:46,719
And it points to the fundamental way we think and believe in things, no matter how irrational they may be.

656
00:43:46,759 --> 00:43:52,025
I mean, I was thinking, we were having that, what was it?

657
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,208
There was that big hog last night, you know?

658
00:43:55,289 --> 00:43:55,890
Yeah.

659
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:57,292
And the hog roast, right?

660
00:43:57,332 --> 00:44:02,038
And it was, if you think about it, why are we outraged when we...

661
00:44:02,798 --> 00:44:07,259
when someone eats a dog and not when we eat an equally sentient animal like a pig.

662
00:44:07,299 --> 00:44:13,602
Now, I'm not a vegetarian, but I recognize it as an irrational belief system or way of being.

663
00:44:13,622 --> 00:44:17,703
The same could be applied to race, religion, gender.

664
00:44:17,923 --> 00:44:22,265
We just categorize and believe strange, delusional things.

665
00:44:24,267 --> 00:44:26,667
And we all grow up with these ingrained belief systems and delusions

666
00:44:26,687 --> 00:44:29,068
that we can't escape without extraordinary effort.

667
00:44:29,768 --> 00:44:34,449
Often, but not always, a change in belief system requires trauma.

668
00:44:36,249 --> 00:44:38,950
And what we see in the psychotic mind

669
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:44,611
are the very extreme cases of the mechanism that we all have in action.

670
00:44:45,572 --> 00:44:48,852
So for Senua, this manifests in several ways.

671
00:44:49,433 --> 00:44:52,773
The Norse legends that are told to her by Druth are what shapes her reality.

672
00:44:53,938 --> 00:44:56,239
She is on a real quest. This isn't all a dream.

673
00:44:56,259 --> 00:44:59,279
She is on a real quest fighting Viking warriors,

674
00:44:59,339 --> 00:45:03,240
but like Don Quixote, what she sees and believes

675
00:45:03,681 --> 00:45:06,561
are interpreted by what she knows

676
00:45:06,741 --> 00:45:08,502
and what her life experiences are.

677
00:45:10,482 --> 00:45:12,403
And the dark rot mechanism in the game

678
00:45:12,903 --> 00:45:14,123
that we shared with the player...

679
00:45:15,498 --> 00:45:22,480
somewhat controversially with our permadeath message. That's part of the belief systems,

680
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:27,101
the delusional belief systems that we wanted to instill in the player. But contrary to

681
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:33,622
what people may think, the message is not a lie. It's not a lie. It's our interpretation

682
00:45:33,682 --> 00:45:38,344
of it based on our prior belief systems that makes it what it is.

683
00:45:44,525 --> 00:45:44,685
So,

684
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:50,060
You can read about psychosis, the symptoms, the theory,

685
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:53,902
but in a video game, we could do so much more.

686
00:45:54,682 --> 00:45:58,583
We give you a taste of the lived experience.

687
00:45:59,244 --> 00:46:03,185
And this scene is one of my favorite ones.

688
00:46:04,005 --> 00:46:06,506
It sort of encapsulates all these different aspects,

689
00:46:07,067 --> 00:46:10,028
going into a flashback, seeing visions,

690
00:46:10,148 --> 00:46:11,568
the voices coming out of it.

691
00:46:12,028 --> 00:46:15,149
One of our mental health advisors told us that

692
00:46:16,147 --> 00:46:23,833
The thing that hurts the most for her was being in a beautiful state of mind,

693
00:46:23,873 --> 00:46:27,956
in a calm, serene, beautiful state of mind, because visions can be positive.

694
00:46:29,677 --> 00:46:34,260
And then it's just being pulled like a rug under your feet into something horrific.

695
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:37,943
When you're not prepared for what's coming, that's when it hurts the most.

696
00:46:39,064 --> 00:46:44,308
And I think this is a scene that encapsulates that, so we'll have some volume for this.

697
00:46:47,113 --> 00:46:48,474
Oh.

698
00:46:49,935 --> 00:46:50,295
Here we go.

699
00:46:55,439 --> 00:46:56,180
Let me try that again.

700
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:56,480
Hang on.

701
00:46:58,922 --> 00:47:01,704
What's your name?

702
00:47:21,218 --> 00:47:22,419
Senua.

703
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:25,241
I haven't seen you before.

704
00:47:25,321 --> 00:47:27,323
I'm not... I don't leave home much.

705
00:47:27,723 --> 00:47:28,664
Oh.

706
00:47:28,684 --> 00:47:29,404
Xenu's daughter.

707
00:47:29,504 --> 00:47:31,366
I have to go.

708
00:47:31,386 --> 00:47:31,586
Wait!

709
00:47:31,606 --> 00:47:36,249
Who taught you to fight like that?

710
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:37,530
No one.

711
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:37,770
No one?

712
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:41,793
Well, I... I watched you, and...

713
00:47:41,933 --> 00:47:46,537
You... learnt all of that from watching me?

714
00:47:50,615 --> 00:47:52,636
You should become a warrior, you know.

715
00:47:52,916 --> 00:47:53,257
Me?

716
00:47:55,398 --> 00:48:00,222
I'm Dillion. I'm here for the warrior trials.

717
00:48:00,242 --> 00:48:00,922
Come on.

718
00:48:03,324 --> 00:48:05,926
Bring your swords.

719
00:48:06,266 --> 00:48:07,667
You can't put it into words.

720
00:48:09,248 --> 00:48:15,413
That moment when you look into the eyes of the one who is supposed to reassure you, make you feel safe.

721
00:48:39,733 --> 00:48:42,434
Everyone knows that there's no going back to how things worked.

722
00:48:44,735 --> 00:48:45,835
But there's nothing to go back to.

723
00:48:45,855 --> 00:48:48,336
I don't want to stay still. I want to stay quiet.

724
00:48:48,416 --> 00:48:49,617
I intend to learn.

725
00:48:49,657 --> 00:48:51,757
Their gods can see into your mind.

726
00:48:52,397 --> 00:48:54,758
They will use this power to destroy you.

727
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:55,638
They won't stop me.

728
00:48:55,658 --> 00:48:57,839
I can still feel him.

729
00:48:57,919 --> 00:49:01,540
Whatever's left of him, they will never let him go.

730
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:04,191
I'm not gonna let him rot here!

731
00:49:04,271 --> 00:49:05,932
You're the one rotting here.

732
00:49:06,092 --> 00:49:07,213
Leave me alone.

733
00:49:07,473 --> 00:49:08,694
You will die here.

734
00:49:08,714 --> 00:49:08,754
No!

735
00:49:09,034 --> 00:49:12,337
And all your suffering will have been for nothing!

736
00:49:12,437 --> 00:49:21,443
Shut up!

737
00:49:21,523 --> 00:49:22,144
Senua...

738
00:49:22,164 --> 00:49:22,504
Dillion?

739
00:49:24,505 --> 00:49:25,086
Is that you?

740
00:49:30,189 --> 00:49:32,271
I'll find you.

741
00:49:34,357 --> 00:49:46,701
I promise.

742
00:49:46,761 --> 00:49:51,782
So she believes that she can save her lover's soul,

743
00:49:51,802 --> 00:49:55,064
despite the fact that she's carrying his head,

744
00:49:55,464 --> 00:49:57,524
dead corpse head on her hip.

745
00:49:58,365 --> 00:50:00,165
So it sort of incorporates all of those

746
00:50:00,285 --> 00:50:02,126
kind of belief systems, visions,

747
00:50:02,306 --> 00:50:04,027
auditory hallucinations, flashbacks.

748
00:50:05,784 --> 00:50:14,935
And it's moving in a way that just reading about this in the DSM or whatever just doesn't bring across.

749
00:50:14,955 --> 00:50:17,518
And I think that's what games have the power to do.

750
00:50:19,092 --> 00:50:19,932
So I'll leave you with this thought.

751
00:50:20,093 --> 00:50:25,958
It's clear to me now that the notion of objective reality is just an impossibility, but that

752
00:50:25,998 --> 00:50:31,343
doesn't mean that we have to live, just accept an irrational state of mind.

753
00:50:31,904 --> 00:50:36,588
We can all see the shadows of Plato's cave if we look for them.

754
00:50:36,608 --> 00:50:39,671
We can find it in science, in evidence, in lived experience.

755
00:50:39,711 --> 00:50:43,775
So without losing sight of these, we can strive for higher levels of understanding.

756
00:50:44,642 --> 00:50:48,283
we can improve our personal simulation of our world and our place in it.

757
00:50:48,784 --> 00:50:50,504
And with games we have a tangible tool

758
00:50:50,564 --> 00:50:53,925
with which we can share our simulation with other people.

759
00:50:55,486 --> 00:50:59,787
This game has now attracted the attention of clinicians, policy makers

760
00:51:00,528 --> 00:51:04,529
and we've presented it to the Houses of Parliament, to MPs.

761
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:08,951
And I think there's an interest in it because we've made the invisible visible

762
00:51:09,271 --> 00:51:13,312
and ideas are starting to form about how gaming technology could be used.

763
00:51:13,924 --> 00:51:18,527
to help understand and treat conditions like these in the future.

764
00:51:19,527 --> 00:51:24,611
So my pitch to you as artists, creators, is this.

765
00:51:24,751 --> 00:51:27,253
Don't sacrifice evidence on the altar of entertainment.

766
00:51:27,493 --> 00:51:30,235
Don't assume that your audience is too dumb to relate to reality.

767
00:51:30,675 --> 00:51:32,436
If you're a confident artist or storyteller,

768
00:51:32,797 --> 00:51:34,838
the pursuit of truth won't hinder you.

769
00:51:34,938 --> 00:51:36,579
It will support you and enhance your visions

770
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,562
in ways that will set you apart from cliché and derivative works.

771
00:51:42,338 --> 00:51:45,040
So that's the lesson that I have learned making Hellblade.

772
00:51:45,681 --> 00:52:01,093
And I'll pass it back to Don. Thank you.

773
00:52:01,273 --> 00:52:04,276
So Hellblade started out as an experiment to see if we could break

774
00:52:04,356 --> 00:52:04,636
through

775
00:52:04,656 --> 00:52:07,118
uh... that that triple A

776
00:52:07,678 --> 00:52:10,941
blockbuster model, create a game that we...

777
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:17,722
we want to create in our vision for fans that love them and we're really happy to be able to say that

778
00:52:18,242 --> 00:52:21,704
that experiment turned into a great success for us.

779
00:52:23,304 --> 00:52:27,306
Critically, the reviews we received for the game were phenomenal.

780
00:52:28,346 --> 00:52:32,248
We're extremely happy to have picked up a number of different awards.

781
00:52:34,108 --> 00:52:38,670
Last week we heard that we've received nine BAFTA nominations, which is incredible.

782
00:52:39,408 --> 00:52:41,831
And the game's been a commercial success as well.

783
00:52:41,891 --> 00:52:48,861
We kept our budget low enough that our break-even at $30 was under 500,000 units.

784
00:52:50,082 --> 00:52:54,408
And we went through that several months ahead of what we thought we would.

785
00:52:55,850 --> 00:52:59,673
And we're well into profit on the game now, which is incredible.

786
00:53:00,414 --> 00:53:05,198
And when we started this project, we had the notion that if we could make this work,

787
00:53:05,238 --> 00:53:10,483
then not only could we as Ninja Theory continue to make independent AAA games,

788
00:53:10,583 --> 00:53:13,065
but that it would be an example for other developers

789
00:53:13,125 --> 00:53:15,527
that find themselves in a similar situation to us too.

790
00:53:16,328 --> 00:53:21,656
that can use it as ammunition when they're having those conversations with publishers, with funders,

791
00:53:21,776 --> 00:53:26,683
or internally to say, look, if Ninja Theory can make it work with their vision, with Hellblade Center,

792
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,986
with Sacrifice, then maybe we can make it work too.

793
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:35,372
So, critically successful, commercially successful, which are all things that we hope for.

794
00:53:36,533 --> 00:53:43,896
But I think one of the most valuable things in this project for us, and one of the most

795
00:53:43,956 --> 00:53:51,339
unexpected things, was the overwhelming response to the themes that we presented in the game.

796
00:53:52,700 --> 00:54:01,147
We've received hundreds of messages from players that have found that the game and Senegalese

797
00:54:01,167 --> 00:54:05,511
journey has had an impact on them and on their lives and the lives of their family.

798
00:54:07,165 --> 00:54:10,847
people have found that it's given them a language in which they can talk about their own difficulties.

799
00:54:10,927 --> 00:54:16,951
It's given them a platform and confidence to talk about their own mental health difficulties

800
00:54:17,011 --> 00:54:22,193
for the first time. And people have shown it to their friends and family and said,

801
00:54:23,014 --> 00:54:28,277
what Senewa has gone through in this story is similar to what I've been through.

802
00:54:29,037 --> 00:54:32,479
And it's helped people to understand. Which, you know, for us...

803
00:54:33,938 --> 00:54:39,744
Us personally, I think being able to work on this project and have that kind of reaction

804
00:54:39,784 --> 00:54:42,107
has been something I never thought I'd have in my career.

805
00:54:43,408 --> 00:54:47,292
I think that is due to the independent AAA model, to have that creative vision, to take

806
00:54:47,352 --> 00:54:51,076
creative risks and have a creative focus, we could deliver something that has had a

807
00:54:51,276 --> 00:54:52,338
genuine impact.

808
00:54:54,058 --> 00:54:57,960
Not only that, but we, through the success of Hellblade, we had the opportunity to give

809
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:00,080
something back to that mental health community.

810
00:55:00,821 --> 00:55:07,264
And on Mental Health Awareness Day last October, October the 10th, we were in a position to

811
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:10,485
donate all of the proceeds that we at Ninja Theory received from the sale of the game

812
00:55:10,545 --> 00:55:11,005
on that day.

813
00:55:11,626 --> 00:55:17,888
And we were able to give a check for just over £60,000 to Rethink Mental Illness, a

814
00:55:17,968 --> 00:55:23,691
charity that focuses on helping people who are diagnosed with mental health issues.

815
00:55:25,512 --> 00:55:27,573
So that sums up the presentation for today.

816
00:55:27,653 --> 00:55:29,353
You can follow us on the socials.

817
00:55:30,374 --> 00:55:31,034
You can email me.

818
00:55:31,634 --> 00:55:32,934
Please remember to evaluate the session.

819
00:55:33,254 --> 00:55:33,534
Thank you.

820
00:55:33,594 --> 00:55:35,415
We've got five minutes for questions.

821
00:55:35,435 --> 00:55:44,297
Thanks, guys.

822
00:55:44,557 --> 00:55:48,738
Any questions?

823
00:55:48,758 --> 00:55:52,199
Yeah, I think we've got time for a question or two, if

824
00:55:52,239 --> 00:55:53,019
anyone has questions.

825
00:55:55,342 --> 00:56:02,869
just walk up to the mic and... Do you want to fire away?

826
00:56:03,389 --> 00:56:08,734
Okay, I'll go first. Um, my name is Louis, um, very inspi- uh, thanks for the talk, uh, it's

827
00:56:08,774 --> 00:56:15,040
very inspi- inspirational for all of the dev diary. Uh, my question is, um, uh, how was the

828
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:19,104
work-life balance of the 20 people who were involved in Helplet?

829
00:56:21,034 --> 00:56:26,816
I mean we can probably both answer this but I think in Ninja Theory we have, we're dedicated

830
00:56:27,136 --> 00:56:34,138
to you know not scheduling in crunch, you know it's it's counterproductive so I think the nature

831
00:56:34,178 --> 00:56:39,180
of the project it was a big part of our lives but that didn't mean that we were working 24-7,

832
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:44,562
we were working every weekend, that wasn't the case, yes we put in extra time and hard work

833
00:56:44,582 --> 00:56:46,923
at the end of the project to realize it but

834
00:56:48,604 --> 00:56:52,326
you can't schedule in crunch.

835
00:56:52,346 --> 00:56:54,828
This model wouldn't work on that basis.

836
00:56:55,168 --> 00:56:57,329
And one way we try and avoid it is to,

837
00:56:57,909 --> 00:56:58,950
we give time off in lieu.

838
00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:01,491
So when people have to work to a deadline,

839
00:57:02,032 --> 00:57:03,933
we have to give the time off in lieu.

840
00:57:04,113 --> 00:57:07,115
So that controls how much we ask of them.

841
00:57:07,695 --> 00:57:08,475
Awesome, thank you very much.

842
00:57:08,876 --> 00:57:09,136
Thank you.

843
00:57:09,256 --> 00:57:11,637
Okay, let's do maybe one.

844
00:57:12,077 --> 00:57:14,539
So recalling back to one of my favorite lines

845
00:57:14,579 --> 00:57:16,800
from the game where she's on the bridge

846
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:17,160
and.

847
00:57:18,279 --> 00:57:23,065
The narrator mentions, you know, if you think that Senua's reality is warped,

848
00:57:23,085 --> 00:57:24,827
then you have to admit there's a chance yours is too.

849
00:57:25,367 --> 00:57:27,750
And the whole game taps into this fantant...

850
00:57:28,156 --> 00:57:33,020
a fantastic concept within the player of their empathy, which is one of the, I think, core

851
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:34,821
learning capabilities of the brain.

852
00:57:35,382 --> 00:57:41,586
What kind of ways, or have you guys ever thought about using this game as even like an academic

853
00:57:41,766 --> 00:57:43,268
educational project?

854
00:57:43,628 --> 00:57:47,191
As an independent developer, you guys don't really have a publisher to kind of block that.

855
00:57:47,211 --> 00:57:51,454
Yeah, so the question is, have we thought about using it in an academic or research

856
00:57:51,514 --> 00:57:51,854
basis?

857
00:57:52,815 --> 00:57:58,420
Professor Paul and his research team uses the game to teach his students.

858
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,463
We've had various psychiatrists and clinicians get in touch with us,

859
00:58:02,503 --> 00:58:05,446
and they use the game to show to people.

860
00:58:06,567 --> 00:58:11,171
But really what the game does is help people see, experience something.

861
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:15,435
I think there's another step beyond that, which is if we can simulate these realities,

862
00:58:15,475 --> 00:58:16,195
we can probably...

863
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:24,532
phenotype them, phenotype people's experiences, and then see if treatments may or may not

864
00:58:24,573 --> 00:58:25,153
have a success.

865
00:58:25,213 --> 00:58:31,077
So that's something I would dearly like either ourselves or other researchers to explore.

866
00:58:32,318 --> 00:58:32,799
Thank you so much.

867
00:58:33,339 --> 00:58:34,940
And we probably have time for just one more.

868
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:35,601
I'm sorry, guys.

869
00:58:35,621 --> 00:58:44,107
I don't know if this is an actual thing with the types of psychosis that you were dealing

870
00:58:44,147 --> 00:58:44,688
with in the game.

871
00:58:45,161 --> 00:58:47,204
So I apologize if this question doesn't make that much sense.

872
00:58:47,645 --> 00:58:50,750
But in your research in trying to basically replicate

873
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:54,817
these experiences that are, in some cases, I'm sure,

874
00:58:54,837 --> 00:58:57,441
traumatic, were you ever afraid that you would?

875
00:58:58,742 --> 00:59:01,903
cause harm to people that were engaging in the game?

876
00:59:01,943 --> 00:59:04,124
And how did you mitigate that?

877
00:59:04,144 --> 00:59:08,326
Yeah, so were we afraid that we would cause harm

878
00:59:08,346 --> 00:59:09,206
by doing this?

879
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:13,648
Well, I mean, I was, yes, but until I understood

880
00:59:13,788 --> 00:59:15,368
that the issues that people have

881
00:59:15,548 --> 00:59:20,430
like are incredibly pervasive, repetitive issues

882
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:22,211
that dogged them for years and years and years.

883
00:59:22,451 --> 00:59:25,672
And I don't think one piece of entertainment is...

884
00:59:27,149 --> 00:59:31,973
is going to be the tipping point. But I would also argue that having an honest representation

885
00:59:32,013 --> 00:59:36,616
is, is better than having the myriad of dishonest reputations, representations that are out

886
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:42,280
there. So most people, you know, we put a warning sign up, we put a help page up, uh, for

887
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:47,563
people. So we, we, we've tried to, we, we tried to show the truth, but also to kind of just

888
00:59:47,623 --> 00:59:52,207
caution people and give them somewhere to go. Thanks. It was a fantastic talk. Alright, I'm

889
00:59:52,227 --> 00:59:54,228
sorry guys, I think we're out of time there, so.

890
00:59:55,186 --> 00:59:56,780
Thank you so much for coming.
