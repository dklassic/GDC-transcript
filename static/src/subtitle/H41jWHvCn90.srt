1
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,482
I'm Austin. I'm just going to dive right in here.

2
00:00:09,322 --> 00:00:12,505
And as usual, my favorite part of this kind of thing

3
00:00:12,905 --> 00:00:14,826
is in the discussion afterward.

4
00:00:15,227 --> 00:00:20,190
And I kind of see my job as hopefully posing provocative

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,591
or interesting questions or ideas

6
00:00:21,912 --> 00:00:23,413
that we can hash out in Q&A.

7
00:00:23,973 --> 00:00:25,634
So I'm going to kind of blitz through things.

8
00:00:25,714 --> 00:00:28,877
And at some point, I'll probably play a few seconds

9
00:00:28,917 --> 00:00:30,998
of something and say, okay, moving on.

10
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,754
So if for some reason I cut off something that is of use to you or valuable,

11
00:00:36,794 --> 00:00:40,437
please just scream at me and tell me to pause there,

12
00:00:40,797 --> 00:00:43,619
because the whole point of doing any of this

13
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:46,061
is to share something that is hopefully meaningful and worth hearing.

14
00:00:46,802 --> 00:00:49,184
And if I am circumventing that,

15
00:00:49,244 --> 00:00:52,446
then I'm literally defeating my entire purpose on standing up here.

16
00:00:53,327 --> 00:00:54,728
So, with that said,

17
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,473
last summer we shipped the third of a franchise that I had worked on for...

18
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,282
over six years called the Banner Saga.

19
00:01:04,043 --> 00:01:06,864
That is a wonderful kind of case study

20
00:01:07,504 --> 00:01:10,406
for the success of an indie,

21
00:01:10,926 --> 00:01:12,527
a little fledgling indie that could.

22
00:01:13,267 --> 00:01:17,509
They're one of the sort of flagship Kickstarter games

23
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:19,890
that I can't overstate the privilege

24
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,851
and joy of having worked on.

25
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:25,192
Out of curiosity, who here's played those games?

26
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:25,813
Oh, awesome.

27
00:01:26,793 --> 00:01:28,674
Well, now I know it's like where the intersection of.

28
00:01:29,472 --> 00:01:33,213
turn-based strategy and willing to wake up and be at a 9 a.m. talk exists.

29
00:01:33,913 --> 00:01:36,114
Probably the entirety of that demographic is in this room.

30
00:01:36,434 --> 00:01:38,314
So, okay, good.

31
00:01:39,775 --> 00:01:44,116
I didn't want to spend too much time on the basics of the game

32
00:01:44,636 --> 00:01:45,856
since we're here to talk about the music,

33
00:01:45,896 --> 00:01:52,138
and especially I want to get into kind of the meta story,

34
00:01:52,158 --> 00:01:54,678
the peripheral story around the score itself,

35
00:01:55,398 --> 00:01:55,818
and make it...

36
00:01:56,245 --> 00:01:58,667
about how we were able to do the things that we were able

37
00:01:58,767 --> 00:02:01,688
as opposed to purely just kind of having a musical nerdiness

38
00:02:01,728 --> 00:02:03,329
about themes and that sort of thing.

39
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:04,890
But we will do a taste of that.

40
00:02:06,351 --> 00:02:07,952
So yes, it all started as a Kickstarter.

41
00:02:07,992 --> 00:02:10,513
It was three guys from Bioware who had basically

42
00:02:10,573 --> 00:02:14,095
gotten fed up with 10 years of working on the Old Republic

43
00:02:14,836 --> 00:02:17,597
and said, we want to make our own thing.

44
00:02:17,757 --> 00:02:21,620
And they quit their job and put this game on Kickstarter

45
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,061
and had the very lucky timing of putting it on Kickstarter.

46
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:28,317
right when that sort of 2012 magical gold rush happened.

47
00:02:28,777 --> 00:02:30,238
They had already prepared the campaign

48
00:02:30,258 --> 00:02:32,780
to hit the green light when Double Fine

49
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,643
announced their Kickstarter and sort of triggered

50
00:02:35,663 --> 00:02:37,124
an explosion of interest.

51
00:02:37,784 --> 00:02:39,326
And so they were already queued up ready to go

52
00:02:39,346 --> 00:02:40,487
and just hit the button.

53
00:02:40,587 --> 00:02:44,550
And then within 24 hours, they were 300% funding

54
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,170
or something like that.

55
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,632
And they were one of those kinds of stories.

56
00:02:48,073 --> 00:02:51,035
And this was back in those naive, wonderful,

57
00:02:51,055 --> 00:02:51,816
innocent days of 2012 when.

58
00:02:53,378 --> 00:02:55,518
no one realized that there's like a 50-50 chance

59
00:02:55,558 --> 00:02:56,739
that you'll give them all this money

60
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,759
and they'll actually make the game.

61
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:01,700
And so there was a lot of love and excitement going into it

62
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,880
and I was brought in, in the middle of their campaign

63
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,121
they called me and said, can we show you our game

64
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:07,001
and are you interested?

65
00:03:07,761 --> 00:03:09,322
And I was blown away immediately.

66
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,142
For those of you who aren't familiar,

67
00:03:11,182 --> 00:03:12,662
you know, this art style of the game

68
00:03:12,702 --> 00:03:14,023
is one of the things that immediately

69
00:03:14,103 --> 00:03:15,463
kind of announces itself to people

70
00:03:15,523 --> 00:03:19,864
and I just thought this is just too fantastic.

71
00:03:21,124 --> 00:03:21,664
So off we went.

72
00:03:23,044 --> 00:03:24,225
an actual post-mortem.

73
00:03:24,945 --> 00:03:32,409
And I'm just going to quickly give you some rundown of the score and the creative choices

74
00:03:32,429 --> 00:03:32,909
that were made.

75
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:38,112
But I really want to focus on this kind of second point here of the logistical analysis

76
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:41,414
and how we were able to pragmatically achieve what we were.

77
00:03:41,534 --> 00:03:43,915
The title of this talk is how to make indie sound AAA.

78
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,512
It was really, it was not easy, but at the same time,

79
00:03:47,532 --> 00:03:50,054
it sort of was easy, and that's why I'm excited

80
00:03:50,074 --> 00:03:51,676
to talk about it, and the big takeaway

81
00:03:51,716 --> 00:03:53,377
that I'm just gonna repeat over and over and over

82
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:55,059
is about embracing your constraints.

83
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:56,700
It's about finding those things

84
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,062
that appear to be a limiting factor

85
00:03:58,102 --> 00:04:01,665
and turning them into an enabler of ideas and of creativity.

86
00:04:03,196 --> 00:04:08,359
and letting the specifics of that situation dictate your creative vocabulary so that it

87
00:04:08,399 --> 00:04:13,923
becomes itself, it becomes the thing that it could have only been made under these circumstances

88
00:04:13,943 --> 00:04:19,566
because ultimately that's, I think, the thing we're all chasing, especially as composers

89
00:04:19,606 --> 00:04:23,408
at least, as artists in general, trying to make something that sort of is this magical

90
00:04:23,448 --> 00:04:26,170
distillation of truth in that moment.

91
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:31,133
And so that's only achieved, I think, by...

92
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,143
embracing these constraints.

93
00:04:33,183 --> 00:04:35,585
So I'm also gonna kinda skip around a little bit

94
00:04:36,165 --> 00:04:39,006
amongst the three games and not do

95
00:04:39,086 --> 00:04:42,148
kind of a chronological retelling of the trilogy.

96
00:04:43,008 --> 00:04:45,009
So to start, the most obvious thing about this

97
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,771
is that it's music written for a wind ensemble.

98
00:04:47,811 --> 00:04:49,531
This is a photo from our recording session

99
00:04:49,591 --> 00:04:50,332
of the first game.

100
00:04:50,772 --> 00:04:51,873
And so the first thing that's obvious

101
00:04:51,933 --> 00:04:54,694
is this is not a recording studio that we did this in.

102
00:04:55,474 --> 00:04:58,576
This was the Myerson Symphony Center in Dallas, Texas.

103
00:04:59,472 --> 00:05:01,473
And that ensemble is the Dallas Winds.

104
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,775
At the time, they were called the Dallas Wind Symphony,

105
00:05:03,815 --> 00:05:05,076
and then they decided they were sick

106
00:05:05,116 --> 00:05:06,837
of getting confused with the Dallas Symphony.

107
00:05:07,397 --> 00:05:08,958
And so, now they're the Dallas Winds.

108
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,561
And just for my fellow nerds,

109
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:15,403
I thought I'd throw in there what the instrumentation was

110
00:05:15,463 --> 00:05:16,304
on those first sessions.

111
00:05:17,204 --> 00:05:21,327
And so, quick story on how we got to this choice is

112
00:05:22,728 --> 00:05:25,330
I had a good, solid two years.

113
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,491
I mean, of course, like all games,

114
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:27,431
it was supposed to be, you know,

115
00:05:27,451 --> 00:05:28,432
we're gonna make it nine months.

116
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,843
Then six months in, it was like, well, OK, maybe a year.

117
00:05:32,463 --> 00:05:34,525
And then as a year starts to approach, OK, well,

118
00:05:34,565 --> 00:05:36,186
it's for sure going to be at least 18 months.

119
00:05:36,887 --> 00:05:39,649
And then at 18 months, it's like, OK, we're

120
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:40,990
all about to be broke and homeless.

121
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,432
So two years it's going to be, regardless

122
00:05:43,473 --> 00:05:44,253
of the state of the game.

123
00:05:44,934 --> 00:05:47,976
And so I had a lot of time to think about it and mull it over.

124
00:05:48,016 --> 00:05:49,418
And something that happened that was very fortunate

125
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:52,800
was, as a way to play test their turn-based strategy mechanics,

126
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,563
they created a free online multiplayer.

127
00:05:55,985 --> 00:05:59,568
called Factions, that was basically just simple 1v1

128
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,232
playing of the game, and had no story or anything like that,

129
00:06:04,272 --> 00:06:06,554
it was just kind of a tournament mode.

130
00:06:07,315 --> 00:06:10,057
So I played that like 150 hours or something like that,

131
00:06:10,097 --> 00:06:11,898
because I would be able to write music,

132
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,059
and then we'd bake it into the build,

133
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:14,340
and I could go on and play someone

134
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,521
and see how that music reacts

135
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:18,704
in an actual kind of live fire situation within an hour.

136
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,487
A lot of interesting things seemed to emerge,

137
00:06:22,527 --> 00:06:25,209
and one of them early on was the actual palette.

138
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:25,329
We...

139
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,564
they had greenlit a really,

140
00:06:28,504 --> 00:06:30,025
because their Kickstarter was so successful,

141
00:06:30,065 --> 00:06:31,626
but the team was really small,

142
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:34,347
they had said, you know, we're willing to carve out

143
00:06:34,387 --> 00:06:37,789
a pretty substantial amount of money for the score,

144
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:40,790
but that's all kind of abstract and hypothetical

145
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,491
until you know what kind of score you're gonna write.

146
00:06:42,571 --> 00:06:44,212
So I just kind of said, well, you know,

147
00:06:44,272 --> 00:06:47,233
it's Viking lore and it's about the end of the world,

148
00:06:48,053 --> 00:06:50,975
and so, you know, let's start toying around

149
00:06:50,995 --> 00:06:51,975
with something orchestral.

150
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:57,878
It's kind of generic to just assume it's going to be orchestra, but you know, I'm a believer that writing is in the rewriting.

151
00:06:57,938 --> 00:06:59,460
So let's just start somewhere.

152
00:06:59,641 --> 00:07:04,148
And if it's garbage, which it inevitably will be, we will start to modify it.

153
00:07:04,568 --> 00:07:05,890
And so I started writing music.

154
00:07:06,354 --> 00:07:09,195
And then at some point, I just kind of took a step back

155
00:07:09,755 --> 00:07:11,595
and listened to it and realized,

156
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,696
you know, I'm not really using the strings.

157
00:07:13,736 --> 00:07:15,616
They're sort of texturally like violins

158
00:07:15,656 --> 00:07:16,497
holding some high notes.

159
00:07:16,517 --> 00:07:19,077
It was all kind of brass corrals and things like that.

160
00:07:19,537 --> 00:07:20,978
And I then had this flash to,

161
00:07:21,298 --> 00:07:22,778
when I was in college at NYU,

162
00:07:24,299 --> 00:07:26,179
there was a world premiere at Carnegie Hall

163
00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:28,020
of John Corleano's third symphony

164
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,600
called the Circus Maximus, which was commissioned.

165
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,901
It was at the time, it was the largest,

166
00:07:31,921 --> 00:07:33,421
I think it still might be, the largest.

167
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:41,318
wind ensemble commission ever. It's like a 45 minute symphony, all unbroken, continuous music.

168
00:07:42,077 --> 00:07:44,820
for just the most unbelievably huge group.

169
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,442
You know, I love that it's like a 70-piece group,

170
00:07:47,482 --> 00:07:49,403
but they don't have the 40 quiet ones

171
00:07:49,443 --> 00:07:50,604
in the form of the strings.

172
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:53,827
So, you know, it's like 25 trumpets and 12 trombones

173
00:07:54,347 --> 00:07:56,049
and 10,000 tubas or whatever, I don't know.

174
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:59,211
And it's all, it's very surround sound,

175
00:07:59,251 --> 00:08:00,492
if any of you are familiar with the piece.

176
00:08:00,512 --> 00:08:01,553
You know, the musicians are scattered

177
00:08:01,573 --> 00:08:02,394
all throughout the hall,

178
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:05,096
and there's a whole drum corps behind you,

179
00:08:05,176 --> 00:08:08,419
and it's a very immersive and crazy theatrical experience.

180
00:08:10,327 --> 00:08:12,228
I was like 19 or something like that,

181
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,649
and as a composition student,

182
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:17,110
we were comped tickets to go see this,

183
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,871
and it rewrote my DNA.

184
00:08:18,891 --> 00:08:21,112
It was the equivalent of Bruce Banner sitting there

185
00:08:21,132 --> 00:08:23,433
and getting the gamma radiation burst,

186
00:08:23,473 --> 00:08:24,894
where just afterward, I emerged,

187
00:08:24,974 --> 00:08:26,935
I came smashing my way out of Carnegie Hall,

188
00:08:26,975 --> 00:08:28,435
a fundamentally different composer,

189
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,656
after this experience of hearing that piece.

190
00:08:31,257 --> 00:08:33,478
And because I was an orchestra kid

191
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:35,419
and a general sort of gamer nerd,

192
00:08:35,439 --> 00:08:36,739
I wasn't one of those band nerds

193
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:38,720
who thought through this lens.

194
00:08:39,794 --> 00:08:44,595
So, I had this flash of the power of a wind ensemble

195
00:08:44,635 --> 00:08:46,556
remembering that experience, and so I thought,

196
00:08:47,216 --> 00:08:51,397
you know, well, I could try to just do a session orchestra

197
00:08:51,457 --> 00:08:53,297
of wind ensemble, but I thought,

198
00:08:53,437 --> 00:08:57,278
what if I called the conductor of that piece

199
00:08:57,418 --> 00:08:58,558
that I was at Carnegie Hall?

200
00:08:58,598 --> 00:08:58,959
Why not?

201
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:00,939
Just see where that conversation goes.

202
00:09:00,979 --> 00:09:02,539
And he's like the foremost conductor

203
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:04,400
for wind ensemble music, named Jerry Junkin,

204
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,620
who teaches at University of Texas, Austin,

205
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,001
and he also conducts one of the foremost.

206
00:09:09,643 --> 00:09:13,246
if not the premier wind ensemble that's professional in the US,

207
00:09:13,406 --> 00:09:14,807
because that's kind of a niche market, right?

208
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:18,510
Like I say, the premier wind ensemble, and it's like on a list of one.

209
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,472
But still, we'll give it to him.

210
00:09:23,373 --> 00:09:27,036
He's a phenomenal conductor, and he's, as is normal in the wind ensemble world,

211
00:09:27,076 --> 00:09:29,058
he's always commissioning composers and things like that,

212
00:09:29,078 --> 00:09:32,540
because that world craves new music in stark contrast to the orchestra,

213
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,763
which is like, we like to cut things off around Mahler.

214
00:09:39,636 --> 00:09:42,898
I just reached out to him and I said, you know, I'm working on a game and you kind of

215
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,501
changed my life with your Circus Maximus commission and performance at Carnegie Hall a number

216
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:51,243
of years ago, and I'm curious if there's an opportunity to work together.

217
00:09:51,283 --> 00:09:54,506
I didn't know if he would even write back to my email, and he writes back like five

218
00:09:54,526 --> 00:09:56,407
minutes later and says, let's jump on the phone.

219
00:09:56,427 --> 00:09:57,467
This sounds super interesting.

220
00:09:57,908 --> 00:10:00,449
And so it turned out that it was one of these pipe dreams of the ensemble.

221
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:04,672
They've released multiple albums, including Grammy nominated or winning albums in the

222
00:10:04,712 --> 00:10:06,593
kind of classical categories.

223
00:10:07,973 --> 00:10:12,697
But the idea of recording a score was one of those sort of pipe dreams that they never

224
00:10:12,777 --> 00:10:15,899
anticipated could possibly be reality, but just they thought would be so cool.

225
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:21,824
And so it very quickly led to a conversation of, well, let's make this reality.

226
00:10:22,324 --> 00:10:30,990
So obviously there's not an abundance of scoring stages in Dallas, turns out, and all their

227
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,553
albums that they've done have been in this hall, the Meyerson Center.

228
00:10:35,178 --> 00:10:37,859
And so it was like, well, what would it take to record there?

229
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:39,780
Well, it turns out it's so not easy,

230
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:41,961
because this is a concert hall.

231
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:43,722
And this is a classic example where

232
00:10:44,042 --> 00:10:46,243
I'm just kind of letting one conversation lead

233
00:10:46,263 --> 00:10:47,304
to the next, to the next, to the next,

234
00:10:47,344 --> 00:10:48,644
and creating all kinds of challenges,

235
00:10:48,684 --> 00:10:51,666
but saying something will, novel and interesting,

236
00:10:51,706 --> 00:10:52,946
is going to emerge out of this.

237
00:10:53,006 --> 00:10:54,547
Or at least that's the hope as I kind of,

238
00:10:54,607 --> 00:10:57,208
it's like Dr. Strangelove writing the nuke down,

239
00:10:57,248 --> 00:10:58,769
just going, I'm sure this is going to be fine.

240
00:10:59,449 --> 00:11:01,110
And, and so.

241
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:03,820
One thing I'm going to get to that is going to come up a lot

242
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:08,202
was that standard practice in a recording session situation,

243
00:11:08,322 --> 00:11:10,944
obviously, is everyone's wearing headphones

244
00:11:11,224 --> 00:11:12,404
and playing to a click.

245
00:11:13,165 --> 00:11:16,067
And they were like, click?

246
00:11:16,887 --> 00:11:18,088
What is this concept?

247
00:11:19,128 --> 00:11:23,491
And it was like, well, to be able to have

248
00:11:23,511 --> 00:11:26,452
a real strong consistency of duration,

249
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:29,174
especially if there's prelays involved, if I have any kind

250
00:11:29,194 --> 00:11:29,234
of.

251
00:11:29,783 --> 00:11:35,687
electronics or otherwise or multi-layering or if we need to stripe it because we're breaking it apart into

252
00:11:35,767 --> 00:11:41,350
Layered, you know brass separate from percussion for implementation purposes or anything like that and they were like, hmm

253
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,711
Let me get back to you and I start getting these emails about how we found this really cool, you know

254
00:11:44,852 --> 00:11:51,895
Wireless low wattage radio transmitter system and we can get a bunch of wireless headphones for the orchestra and I was immediately like

255
00:11:52,636 --> 00:11:57,698
Yeah, this is a this is this is I'm watching two trains in slow motion heading towards each other

256
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:58,639
So I said

257
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:02,059
Tell you what, I'm gonna do this entire score

258
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:03,559
and not require a click.

259
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,860
That's the only way we're gonna get to the finish line here.

260
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,541
And so that single decision ended up being the foundation

261
00:12:10,621 --> 00:12:12,702
for a lot of unusual things that came out of it

262
00:12:12,742 --> 00:12:16,123
because the constraint was how can I record an ensemble

263
00:12:16,883 --> 00:12:18,543
and do an effective game score

264
00:12:18,603 --> 00:12:22,304
where there's no exact, precise consistency

265
00:12:22,344 --> 00:12:24,165
between even subsequent takes.

266
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:25,949
of a given cue.

267
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:30,372
And that, as much as that closed certain doors, it opened up whole doors it never even considered

268
00:12:30,412 --> 00:12:33,514
because it's always the default position to just assume you're gonna record certain ways.

269
00:12:33,935 --> 00:12:36,456
So here's just a little taste of how that sounded.

270
00:12:36,476 --> 00:12:38,618
That was easy.

271
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:49,671
So another thing I decided to really own is that it's the very opposite of a typical studio recording.

272
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:58,715
Normally, I'm a big fan of making recordings immersive, where you're deliberately kind of placing the listener inside the ensemble,

273
00:12:58,735 --> 00:13:04,078
where you're giving them a hyper-real perspective that's not actually physically reproducible acoustically,

274
00:13:04,378 --> 00:13:05,678
where you're getting all the detail of...

275
00:13:06,038 --> 00:13:08,440
a barrage of microphones inside the orchestra,

276
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,461
and also your surrounds and your decantry

277
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,603
and all that kind of thing.

278
00:13:12,743 --> 00:13:16,285
But in this case, we didn't really have that option.

279
00:13:16,325 --> 00:13:18,326
So it's like, I'm gonna own the liveness of it.

280
00:13:18,366 --> 00:13:19,947
I want, we're in a concert hall.

281
00:13:20,048 --> 00:13:22,469
Let's kind of make that part of the group.

282
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:27,072
So it's very much about the ensemble sense,

283
00:13:27,112 --> 00:13:29,394
which is the opposite of how I normally work.

284
00:13:29,414 --> 00:13:31,375
But it led to certain aesthetic considerations.

285
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:34,937
So that's anyway, that's a little taste from

286
00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:36,941
the very first game.

287
00:13:37,021 --> 00:13:41,565
Another thing I'll just mention is, aesthetically about the game itself, there's a mournfulness

288
00:13:41,645 --> 00:13:46,690
to it that I said I really want this to be very heavy emotionally, but not loud.

289
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,512
I'm not really expecting a loud score.

290
00:13:48,832 --> 00:13:53,197
It should be about warriors who are begrudging the fact that they have to go into battle

291
00:13:53,237 --> 00:13:54,818
and they're weary and they're tired.

292
00:13:55,876 --> 00:14:00,459
story points is that the sun, one of the kind of symbols that the apocalypse has begun

293
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,062
is that the sun has come to a complete stop in the sky and they're just eternally in this kind of noon

294
00:14:05,522 --> 00:14:11,026
daylight and everyone's just getting worn totally ragged by the fact that there's never night, there's never rest

295
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,568
and so the notion that these are

296
00:14:14,848 --> 00:14:17,710
powerful warriors, Viking inspired kind of Norse

297
00:14:18,031 --> 00:14:22,594
but they're not bloodlusting, every time they pick up their sword it's with this

298
00:14:22,954 --> 00:14:25,175
massive sigh in resignation and I thought

299
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:29,840
you know, 50 musicians playing loud instruments,

300
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,461
you know, like we had multiple timpani,

301
00:14:31,501 --> 00:14:33,021
you can kind of see in the back corner,

302
00:14:33,262 --> 00:14:35,803
you know, we had a timpani section where I'd write a note

303
00:14:35,883 --> 00:14:37,823
and two timpanists would play that note,

304
00:14:37,863 --> 00:14:38,384
that kind of thing.

305
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:40,465
You get a big body of sound,

306
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:41,805
even if it's playing a pianissimo

307
00:14:41,825 --> 00:14:44,126
and it just made everything feel really heavy.

308
00:14:47,488 --> 00:14:48,988
I'm discovering a flaw in how I set this up,

309
00:14:49,008 --> 00:14:50,649
where it's gonna try to replay my audio.

310
00:14:51,309 --> 00:14:53,630
Skipping to the second and third games,

311
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,411
we stuck with this formula.

312
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:58,321
The second one, we migrated to Colorado.

313
00:14:58,361 --> 00:15:00,984
There's whole stories about how we chose where

314
00:15:01,044 --> 00:15:01,644
and all that kind of thing.

315
00:15:01,664 --> 00:15:02,805
I'm not gonna get into that

316
00:15:02,825 --> 00:15:05,988
because it's not really what I'm after here today.

317
00:15:06,308 --> 00:15:08,771
Very similar but not quite identical instrumentation.

318
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,552
And you'll notice also, just for what it's worth,

319
00:15:11,213 --> 00:15:12,634
for those who are band nerds,

320
00:15:13,135 --> 00:15:18,239
we eschewed some of the normal wind ensemble traditions.

321
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:20,841
For example, the clarinets tend to be the violins

322
00:15:21,062 --> 00:15:22,043
of the wind ensemble.

323
00:15:22,303 --> 00:15:22,883
So a typical.

324
00:15:23,377 --> 00:15:29,862
standard concert band would have like 20 clarinets and so everything just sounds like Sousa marches to me and I hate that and

325
00:15:29,902 --> 00:15:35,007
So I was like we have a normal number of clarinets and I'm sorry to your 20 clarinets that aren't gonna get the call

326
00:15:35,647 --> 00:15:38,430
And have to stay home, but it needs to sound more

327
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:39,831
orchestral and less

328
00:15:41,012 --> 00:15:46,577
Sousa II but kept the saxophones because I thought you know everyone underrates how

329
00:15:46,957 --> 00:15:51,301
Nasty a sax can get we you know it doesn't have to play jazz and it doesn't have to be

330
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,466
you know, an oompah, it doesn't have to be a lot of the things that it has sort of a

331
00:15:54,566 --> 00:15:55,907
stereotypical reputation for

332
00:15:56,687 --> 00:15:56,807
uh...

333
00:15:57,727 --> 00:16:00,108
and uh... and especially for the second game

334
00:16:00,428 --> 00:16:01,729
where the overall aesthetic got

335
00:16:02,409 --> 00:16:03,210
way darker

336
00:16:46,428 --> 00:16:48,950
And they can really play polyrhythms, which is super fun.

337
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,312
Orchestras tend to revolt.

338
00:16:52,653 --> 00:16:55,395
The third score was done in London at AIR.

339
00:16:55,435 --> 00:17:01,840
This was the only one that was done in a more traditional scoring sort of way, but the reason

340
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,961
I chose AIR over Abbey Road was because...

341
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:06,599
Air is kind of like a big hall.

342
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,679
It's basically a converted church.

343
00:17:09,139 --> 00:17:10,820
And if you raise the ceiling all the way up

344
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,900
and you kind of make it as live as possible,

345
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,381
it has very similar acoustics.

346
00:17:15,421 --> 00:17:18,061
And also the third one, we had a shorter schedule

347
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:19,482
and a tighter budget.

348
00:17:19,562 --> 00:17:22,302
And so I actually had to record the entirety

349
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:24,683
of the orchestral parts of the score,

350
00:17:24,723 --> 00:17:26,343
which was about an hour and 10 minutes of music

351
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,964
in a single, very fast-moving day.

352
00:17:30,264 --> 00:17:33,104
And they can do that in London because they're not human.

353
00:17:33,765 --> 00:17:33,865
And.

354
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:37,847
So, um, here's a taste of that.

355
00:17:39,047 --> 00:17:57,156
Is that loud enough?

356
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:58,317
I feel like it should be.

357
00:17:59,384 --> 00:18:01,726
like unfunctiply loud yeah can we are you able to raise it

358
00:18:35,707 --> 00:18:37,068
All right.

359
00:18:37,108 --> 00:18:40,230
That may be as loud as we can go.

360
00:18:43,992 --> 00:18:48,395
The third one was also weirder, as you can hear.

361
00:18:48,415 --> 00:18:49,395
So anyway, it gives you a sense.

362
00:18:49,435 --> 00:18:53,058
So one of the things that ended up being unexpected and unintended

363
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:57,180
is that there's a kind of slight difference in the sound of each one,

364
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,082
because they were all recorded in different cities, different musicians.

365
00:19:00,122 --> 00:19:03,144
There was not a hell of a lot of continuity, musician-wise,

366
00:19:03,164 --> 00:19:04,265
with the exception of.

367
00:19:05,751 --> 00:19:11,916
There's also a bunch of soloists, and the three that form the kind of heart and soul of it are these YouTube stars.

368
00:19:13,938 --> 00:19:19,202
And part of the reason for that was that having come from Kickstarter, I thought this is a game birthed by the Internet.

369
00:19:19,483 --> 00:19:27,089
This is a game that would never have existed without the kind of communal love of 20,000 initial Kickstarter backers who gave it close to a million dollars.

370
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:27,950
And so...

371
00:19:29,371 --> 00:19:31,793
how better to kind of place at the heart and soul of it,

372
00:19:32,394 --> 00:19:34,576
surrounded by the bombast and the heaviness

373
00:19:34,616 --> 00:19:38,579
of the wind ensemble, is some singers and a single violin.

374
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:41,622
The one exception to the no strings policy

375
00:19:43,964 --> 00:19:47,467
would be people whose career is also born of the internet.

376
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:49,008
The whole notion of a YouTube star

377
00:19:49,068 --> 00:19:51,090
is so beautifully 21st century,

378
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,231
like Peter Hollens as an example,

379
00:19:53,672 --> 00:19:56,114
who lives in Eugene, Oregon, and has,

380
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:02,694
Approaching 400 million views on his content 90% of which he makes in his living room

381
00:20:03,675 --> 00:20:05,196
And he's just this spectacular

382
00:20:05,736 --> 00:20:10,880
singer and around the time of this he had done a cover of the dwarf song the misty mountains from the

383
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,803
Hobbit film that I saw and was like I

384
00:20:15,123 --> 00:20:18,526
Need this guy in my life. This is fucking beautiful and

385
00:20:18,966 --> 00:20:21,968
And they're all and their videos like this, you know where he's doing the classic

386
00:20:22,508 --> 00:20:25,991
Multitrack self-camera thing and he's just an amazing vocal producer

387
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:32,739
And then like I said, Taylor, for the one non-string exception.

388
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:34,980
And I told her, I said, you're going to probably feel uncomfortable,

389
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,281
but I want this to be very rustic and raw and live,

390
00:20:37,401 --> 00:20:39,881
especially given the nature of how we're doing the wind ensemble.

391
00:20:40,222 --> 00:20:42,582
So do you have like a practice violin from when you were a kid

392
00:20:42,622 --> 00:20:44,583
that's just objectively not a good violin?

393
00:20:45,283 --> 00:20:45,923
Can we use that?

394
00:20:46,043 --> 00:20:48,264
And can you like tune it and get it perfect?

395
00:20:48,324 --> 00:20:52,065
And then just sort of loose, just kind of randomly twiddle your tuning pegs.

396
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:52,886
Then we'll do it.

397
00:20:53,406 --> 00:20:54,126
It was kind of like the...

398
00:20:54,907 --> 00:20:56,768
You're going to be the reason my career ends, isn't it?

399
00:20:58,008 --> 00:20:58,928
That's the look I got.

400
00:20:58,968 --> 00:20:59,368
She did it.

401
00:20:59,468 --> 00:20:59,988
It's awesome.

402
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:03,849
And then Maluka, who exploded onto YouTube

403
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,430
around that same time, she had done a cover of one

404
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:07,910
of the Bard songs from Skyrim.

405
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,831
And it's hilarious, because she's generally

406
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,571
pretty shy and very sweet.

407
00:21:13,212 --> 00:21:16,312
And she didn't want to share this recording

408
00:21:16,352 --> 00:21:18,753
and her now husband, which I guess

409
00:21:18,773 --> 00:21:20,173
shows that there's a happy end to this story.

410
00:21:20,393 --> 00:21:20,693
Spoiler.

411
00:21:21,511 --> 00:21:25,213
She was at work one day and he put this video of her that she had made

412
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:30,076
Online and then went on reddit. It was like everyone check out this awesome cover

413
00:21:30,136 --> 00:21:34,819
I found or something like that totally so she came home from work discovering

414
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:38,321
She was like a viral phenomenon and didn't have a chance to veto him

415
00:21:39,461 --> 00:21:41,302
And because it's just astoundingly beautiful

416
00:21:41,362 --> 00:21:45,505
I was gonna play you excerpts from all these but I know I'm gonna run out of time if I do so go look up

417
00:21:45,545 --> 00:21:49,867
All of them if you're not already familiar. They're brilliant. I also had a quite a few additional

418
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:56,741
other solos. One of them that's cool is you can see this little instrument here that's

419
00:21:56,761 --> 00:22:02,223
called the non-christian image. Oh, my mouse pointer doesn't show up over there. But the

420
00:22:02,263 --> 00:22:09,565
horn there is called a bucca horn. It's one of the only kind of known Viking instruments

421
00:22:09,985 --> 00:22:12,706
because there's not a lot known about Viking music. It's just one of those things that

422
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:13,847
archaeologists

423
00:22:14,648 --> 00:22:18,292
have found instruments but there's no record of exactly what it sounded like.

424
00:22:18,352 --> 00:22:20,354
Obviously there was no musical notation or anything like that.

425
00:22:20,654 --> 00:22:25,419
And obviously also this is not explicitly a Viking game and even if it were, what's

426
00:22:25,439 --> 00:22:27,401
the point of trying to do Viking music?

427
00:22:27,441 --> 00:22:29,704
We want to make something that's a little bit more emotionally universal.

428
00:22:30,404 --> 00:22:34,125
But I am a fan of kind of coloring it and sprinkling it in so it turns out the bucca horn

429
00:22:34,766 --> 00:22:38,747
There's basically one guy in the world that makes them and it's effectively a lamb's horn

430
00:22:38,847 --> 00:22:43,309
And it's like if you want one you have to order it a year in advance because he has to like raise the lamb and then

431
00:22:43,349 --> 00:22:48,730
Do unspeakable things so my friend Noah who collect he's a trombone player who collects instruments

432
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:51,591
And and he was like I've always wanted to order one from this guy

433
00:22:51,651 --> 00:22:53,952
And so I said he said how much time you have on this game, and I said

434
00:22:54,769 --> 00:22:56,090
I've got at least a year.

435
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,511
And so, he said, OK, I'll check back in with you later.

436
00:22:59,531 --> 00:23:01,451
And then one day he shows up with that thing.

437
00:23:01,931 --> 00:23:03,612
And it's hilarious because it's horrible.

438
00:23:03,652 --> 00:23:08,313
It's basically just a horn that's got holes drilled in it and a mouthpiece jammed on it.

439
00:23:08,673 --> 00:23:11,494
And it can play like six notes and I love it and it's on all three scores.

440
00:23:12,255 --> 00:23:12,455
And so...

441
00:23:15,705 --> 00:23:17,066
Obviously we tracked some percussion.

442
00:23:17,426 --> 00:23:19,788
Johan Sigurdsson was the voice actor from the game

443
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:21,829
who, he just sounds like a Viking.

444
00:23:22,209 --> 00:23:24,030
And so he's just got this amazing,

445
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,292
like I have his original audition.

446
00:23:26,652 --> 00:23:27,792
He's this Icelandic guy who's like,

447
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:31,214
my name is Johan, I'm reading for the Bangers saga.

448
00:23:31,775 --> 00:23:33,916
And it was like, yeah, I don't read the lines.

449
00:23:33,956 --> 00:23:35,597
Just, just when can we see you Monday?

450
00:23:36,117 --> 00:23:39,619
And so I said, I really want to write vocals for this guy.

451
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:41,260
I hope to God he can't sing.

452
00:23:42,276 --> 00:23:44,917
Because it's just going to be so gritty and awesome and delicious.

453
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:48,758
And of course he shows up and he picks up the part he's sight reading sheet music.

454
00:23:48,778 --> 00:23:49,678
And I was like, what the hell?

455
00:23:49,698 --> 00:23:50,539
That's such bullshit.

456
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:54,160
But he was amazing.

457
00:23:54,280 --> 00:24:00,202
And just to compliment my YouTube people, and especially because Peter Hollens is like

458
00:24:00,222 --> 00:24:06,604
the ultimate sort of pure acapella glee club, kind of very pure, specific.

459
00:24:06,644 --> 00:24:09,325
The idea of it being even one cent sharp is horrible to him.

460
00:24:09,729 --> 00:24:12,611
So I had to kind of pour salt all over that in the form of Johann.

461
00:24:13,992 --> 00:24:21,376
And then ever in search of interesting X-factors, I have a friend who's a composer and a didgeridooist.

462
00:24:21,936 --> 00:24:24,798
And so I just had him come over to the studio and I said, I really want to make kind of

463
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,819
all sorts of interesting, weird sounds there.

464
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:28,160
I played a little bit of accordion.

465
00:24:29,652 --> 00:24:32,676
On the second game specifically you can see there was an Icelandic...

466
00:24:33,817 --> 00:24:35,619
By the time we finished the first game and it went really well,

467
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,684
in the meantime this video had gone viral of these guys in Iceland

468
00:24:39,804 --> 00:24:44,550
singing five-part a cappella in a train station, a hymn in Icelandic.

469
00:24:45,368 --> 00:24:48,070
and they're a band called Arsteider that does music that,

470
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,832
to my ear, almost sounds like the band Kansas.

471
00:24:50,892 --> 00:24:53,454
It's sort of like this beautiful, lyrical,

472
00:24:53,654 --> 00:24:57,237
60s ballady sort of thing, but mostly in Icelandic,

473
00:24:57,457 --> 00:24:59,419
and they all play strings and things,

474
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:01,000
and they produce insanely well,

475
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,021
and so I just cold called them,

476
00:25:03,061 --> 00:25:04,442
and I said, I saw your video,

477
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:06,304
and you want to record on a game,

478
00:25:06,364 --> 00:25:08,866
and they're all just like, all right.

479
00:25:09,386 --> 00:25:11,608
They're so insanely chill, and I was,

480
00:25:13,168 --> 00:25:15,430
glad you're excited and anyway I'll see you in a few months.

481
00:25:16,071 --> 00:25:18,533
And so wrote a bunch of stuff for them.

482
00:25:18,593 --> 00:25:20,574
In fact, the weird vocals that you heard

483
00:25:20,594 --> 00:25:22,296
that were all processed and strange

484
00:25:22,316 --> 00:25:24,958
in the last clip, that was from them.

485
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:30,262
And then on the third game added my friend Anthony

486
00:25:30,282 --> 00:25:31,703
in Los Angeles who had just bought,

487
00:25:31,843 --> 00:25:35,386
he's a bassoonist and he bought a bass Sarusaphone.

488
00:25:36,131 --> 00:25:39,934
and sent me a photo of it because he knew that if he sent me a photo I would say,

489
00:25:39,954 --> 00:25:44,958
I need to write for that. I don't know what it sounds like but it looks like a steampunk bassoon.

490
00:25:44,998 --> 00:25:50,363
I mean it's the weirdest thing. It's all these pipes and key switches and it kind of sounds

491
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:56,127
like a baritone saxophone. It's about a really aggressive, it's just ugly as sin and perfect.

492
00:25:56,808 --> 00:26:02,693
And then I also worked with a wonderful singer from the Faroe Islands named Ivor.

493
00:26:03,157 --> 00:26:06,280
And then another, Kristen Naig, is Kristen hiding in here somewhere?

494
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,642
I will embarrass her extensively.

495
00:26:09,123 --> 00:26:11,245
She knew to avoid this talk.

496
00:26:11,765 --> 00:26:13,386
Kristen plays all the woodwinds.

497
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:14,587
I had worked with her on Abzu.

498
00:26:14,608 --> 00:26:16,629
She's the featured oboist on that score.

499
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:17,490
But she plays.

500
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,051
So we created a cocktail.

501
00:26:19,152 --> 00:26:22,394
I sent her a line and I said, will you...

502
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:27,562
record this melody on basically every instrument you have and send me all the stems.

503
00:26:27,622 --> 00:26:30,984
And then I want to kind of create a composite instrument from some subset of that,

504
00:26:31,024 --> 00:26:32,505
and then that will be our template for the score.

505
00:26:32,786 --> 00:26:36,888
Because I wanted some new sound for the third game that had no precedent in the prior ones.

506
00:26:37,249 --> 00:26:43,593
So what we ended up with was this blend where it would be the melody on English horn,

507
00:26:43,693 --> 00:26:46,275
and then an octave higher than that on like an Irish penny whistle.

508
00:26:46,335 --> 00:26:48,716
And I usually would put a huge amount of reverb and delay

509
00:26:48,736 --> 00:26:50,598
so the penny whistle sounded more like overtones.

510
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:57,938
of the English horn. You couldn't really hear it on its own. And then, and then she had this

511
00:26:57,998 --> 00:27:03,441
thing called a zafoon, which looks like a garden hose that someone put a mouthpiece on, and it's

512
00:27:03,501 --> 00:27:10,185
just the weirdest sound ever. I'm pretty sure she made that up. And, but there was this nasally thing

513
00:27:10,205 --> 00:27:15,347
that would show up in the stems that was just fantastic. A good, a good partner for the bass

514
00:27:15,387 --> 00:27:16,168
sarousaphone.

515
00:27:17,863 --> 00:27:19,523
And I'm blanking on what the fourth one was,

516
00:27:19,563 --> 00:27:21,023
but we had this kind of little quartet

517
00:27:21,043 --> 00:27:22,584
that everything I sent her would get recorded,

518
00:27:22,644 --> 00:27:25,664
and then I had my sort of, I crafted a default setting

519
00:27:26,024 --> 00:27:27,705
for all four of them to live in.

520
00:27:28,585 --> 00:27:31,145
And then the last thing that is just always way too fun

521
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:34,506
to not make a point of is our friend Viking Jesus,

522
00:27:35,846 --> 00:27:37,767
who it's actually coincidence

523
00:27:37,787 --> 00:27:39,127
that he would be Viking Jesus,

524
00:27:39,187 --> 00:27:42,708
but he is like a metal musician

525
00:27:42,748 --> 00:27:45,748
who I met through the world of Video Games Live.

526
00:27:46,295 --> 00:27:51,119
Tommy Tallarico and he had done a journey cover of a metal cover of Journey

527
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,882
burning sand and

528
00:27:53,902 --> 00:27:58,505
It was awesome. And so I was like I want to I want to work with him

529
00:27:58,545 --> 00:28:02,869
I need him in my life. And so I wasn't quite sure how to do that

530
00:28:03,089 --> 00:28:08,533
And I thought what about prepared electric guitar, so I'm just gonna if you'll indulge I'm gonna just show you

531
00:28:10,915 --> 00:28:13,417
We did a little kind of behind-the-scenes thing for you

532
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,361
And it's better to just show it in detail.

533
00:28:18,381 --> 00:28:19,881
So in spring of 2012, he went to town and I said,

534
00:28:20,401 --> 00:28:23,662
bring me a giant toolkit of things that I could use. ♪♪♪

535
00:28:30,424 --> 00:28:33,165
Then we decided, what if we went totally over the top,

536
00:28:33,865 --> 00:28:39,287
and you literally sawed this thing in half as a sound?

537
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:42,467
The sound of you literally cutting through this thing.

538
00:28:42,968 --> 00:28:43,688
And he did!

539
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:51,503
And I love how he left all of his shit on the desk, so part of the recording is all the crap vibrating.

540
00:28:56,204 --> 00:28:59,225
So that all that crunk crinkling and that's all the guitar.

541
00:28:59,245 --> 00:29:05,768
I mean he sent me a huge amount of stuff and I created a whole kind of effects library out of it.

542
00:29:13,094 --> 00:29:24,481
You'll see it's, and there's Malucca, and there's the sawing.

543
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:30,344
So that gives you a kind of a sense, and the reason I'm spending a fair bit of time talking

544
00:29:30,384 --> 00:29:34,707
about that is a point that I'm going to get to later in sort of spoiler now.

545
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:37,071
is the idea of embracing constraint.

546
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:38,772
Our budget really was quite narrow.

547
00:29:39,413 --> 00:29:41,174
And so I knew I couldn't write like two hours

548
00:29:41,234 --> 00:29:42,214
of orchestral music.

549
00:29:42,254 --> 00:29:43,575
There wasn't enough in the budget

550
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,996
to record the orchestra for two hours.

551
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:45,896
So you have all these variables

552
00:29:45,916 --> 00:29:47,357
that you could start sliding up and down.

553
00:29:47,817 --> 00:29:48,798
And so one of the choices was,

554
00:29:48,858 --> 00:29:51,059
well, I could do like a small orchestra

555
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:52,620
for the full length of the score,

556
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,422
or I can save that for the sort of most crucial moments

557
00:29:56,482 --> 00:29:59,124
and figure out ways to bridge the gaps with other.

558
00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:04,830
sounds. And the idea is always to make sure that the score doesn't feel like it's got this schizophrenic

559
00:30:05,251 --> 00:30:11,133
sort of square wave of production value where from one moment it sounds great and it's big live ensemble

560
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:14,755
and then the next moment it's like sampled trombones or something.

561
00:30:15,195 --> 00:30:19,637
And so by crafting an aesthetic built around things like soloists and

562
00:30:22,418 --> 00:30:24,699
prepared electric guitar being sawed in half.

563
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:30,531
the score could have ways of distributing itself

564
00:30:30,611 --> 00:30:31,952
over a large amount of time,

565
00:30:32,632 --> 00:30:35,513
where it just sounds like itself at any given moment.

566
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:36,714
You know, it has intimate moments,

567
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:39,335
which are marked by just hearing this guitar craziness,

568
00:30:39,955 --> 00:30:41,376
and a single voice.

569
00:30:41,416 --> 00:30:42,556
And you don't listen to that and think,

570
00:30:42,696 --> 00:30:43,737
wow, but where's the orchestra?

571
00:30:43,797 --> 00:30:46,117
Suddenly, it just is organically the next cue.

572
00:30:46,158 --> 00:30:47,098
It just makes sense.

573
00:30:47,518 --> 00:30:49,359
And you have to build it that way from the beginning.

574
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,060
But it's a great way to make the resources

575
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,881
just go all the way to the finish line.

576
00:30:55,972 --> 00:30:59,196
And so I wanted to get a little bit on kind of the nerdy subject,

577
00:30:59,877 --> 00:31:03,621
because this was a really lucky situation where they were planning to make a trilogy.

578
00:31:03,641 --> 00:31:05,764
Of course, it was all contingent on the first game doing well,

579
00:31:05,784 --> 00:31:07,746
because the Kickstarter was sort of genuinely that.

580
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:09,968
It was a kickstart of this franchise.

581
00:31:10,641 --> 00:31:12,142
We didn't know if it was gonna come off,

582
00:31:12,182 --> 00:31:13,182
but the thing that was so exciting

583
00:31:13,462 --> 00:31:15,323
was that they knew what they wanted this story

584
00:31:15,363 --> 00:31:16,324
to be from the beginning.

585
00:31:16,384 --> 00:31:17,784
So I had my very first meeting with them

586
00:31:17,804 --> 00:31:19,505
in the days after the Kickstarter ended,

587
00:31:19,886 --> 00:31:22,427
where they said, okay, here's how game one is gonna end.

588
00:31:22,787 --> 00:31:24,508
Here's what's gonna happen in game number two,

589
00:31:24,788 --> 00:31:26,189
and here's what's gonna happen in game number three.

590
00:31:26,409 --> 00:31:29,270
And I was able to kind of plant seeds

591
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:32,292
melodically and thematically from the beginning

592
00:31:32,332 --> 00:31:33,792
that I knew weren't gonna be paying off

593
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,833
for five years or something like that,

594
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:38,174
if, you know, sort of God willing, as it were.

595
00:31:38,615 --> 00:31:39,935
So just to give you a little sense of.

596
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:47,651
of that. Here's how the main theme was treated at the beginning of the first game. Purely

597
00:31:47,691 --> 00:31:53,396
the horns and then the rest of the brass. I don't know how readable that is, but it

598
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:57,179
gives you a sense. Like I said, I was very drawn to this kind of brass chorale vibe.

599
00:32:14,211 --> 00:32:19,215
So, you know, very deliberate, kind of regal, noble, slightly mournful quality.

600
00:32:20,115 --> 00:32:27,221
So then, moving along, by the time the second game comes along, same theme, but, you know,

601
00:32:27,941 --> 00:32:28,522
shit's worse.

602
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:51,476
We have Taylor as part of the main title now.

603
00:33:16,922 --> 00:33:19,823
So, you know, things didn't go that great at the end of the first game.

604
00:33:20,863 --> 00:33:22,364
But the good news is it gets even worse.

605
00:33:24,064 --> 00:33:28,726
So, third game, I started... it took me a while to figure out what to do here.

606
00:33:28,746 --> 00:33:31,707
So I start off with the recording of the first game.

607
00:33:33,067 --> 00:33:35,268
And then I kind of send it down the drain.

608
00:33:38,629 --> 00:33:40,590
So right now you're hearing purely relays effectively.

609
00:33:46,283 --> 00:33:48,925
And then here's my little quartet of Kristen layers.

610
00:33:55,029 --> 00:34:01,594
Our weird hybrid composite wind instrument.

611
00:34:02,434 --> 00:34:04,175
This one, of course, just gets even.

612
00:34:21,049 --> 00:34:25,452
So what was so cool is I was able to think about this stuff for like five or six years,

613
00:34:25,492 --> 00:34:31,237
which is very lucky, but that's, you know, not that uncommon for the indie world, which

614
00:34:32,698 --> 00:34:38,363
is useful, because it lets me think about how to optimize it to just be as grand and

615
00:34:38,403 --> 00:34:40,064
lush and itself as possible.

616
00:34:41,506 --> 00:34:44,888
And then so jumping off of that, big spoiler.

617
00:34:46,558 --> 00:34:51,320
The thing that was so interesting to me was that this story that was purporting itself

618
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:55,981
or representing itself as kind of like a Viking apocalypse, you know, Ragnarok kind of thing,

619
00:34:57,022 --> 00:34:59,123
by the time you get to the end of the third game, you realize it's actually kind of like

620
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:01,744
this Romeo and Juliet condemned love story.

621
00:35:02,164 --> 00:35:06,465
And you had almost no indication of that in the first game, and then little teases of

622
00:35:06,525 --> 00:35:10,967
it in the second, and then finally that's sort of an operating factor in the third game.

623
00:35:11,347 --> 00:35:15,309
And so I thought, well, what if the main theme, this sort of statement of...

624
00:35:16,476 --> 00:35:19,957
brawniness and regal nobility and all of that.

625
00:35:20,217 --> 00:35:21,577
What if that's actually the foundation

626
00:35:21,617 --> 00:35:23,498
of the thematic evolution that by the end

627
00:35:23,578 --> 00:35:24,978
has to become this other thing?

628
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:28,239
And so I knew I would have almost no use for this

629
00:35:28,279 --> 00:35:29,759
within the context of the first game,

630
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:33,020
but thought I have to write a theme

631
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,740
that I know can go there eventually.

632
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,841
So you obviously just heard the main theme.

633
00:35:37,221 --> 00:35:40,121
Very simple little bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

634
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:42,322
So the first time you really in earnest hear

635
00:35:42,382 --> 00:35:44,222
what I'm gonna do with it is in the second.

636
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:49,422
in the end credits. Here's a variation on that melody that Malouka sings.

637
00:35:49,482 --> 00:35:57,729
It's a little different though.

638
00:36:16,146 --> 00:36:21,129
So it gives you a se- so then by the time the second game comes along, there's two characters that are

639
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:28,234
you know, essentially pretending to not really know each other that well in a way and later it turns out like their kind of secret

640
00:36:28,274 --> 00:36:31,036
Love is what's essentially causing the apocalypse

641
00:36:32,277 --> 00:36:38,661
typical and uh, so um, so here's the like there's a scene where they're fighting and I was like, let's use that

642
00:37:02,558 --> 00:37:05,499
And then so by the time of the third game, you have...

643
00:37:06,512 --> 00:37:10,212
you know that's just all the cards end up on the table and you end up with this

644
00:37:10,612 --> 00:37:13,793
this you know this this thing that began

645
00:37:14,313 --> 00:37:16,734
very regal and noble and then has become very kind of

646
00:37:17,754 --> 00:37:19,754
full of love and then corrupted to all hell

647
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:50,852
And then by the time we reach the end credits of the third game, it all has to kind of come

648
00:37:50,892 --> 00:37:52,793
full circle.

649
00:38:14,407 --> 00:38:19,650
You can hear this common ingredient that's going from one way, and this is happening

650
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,431
in other places, but I'm skipping a lot of stuff.

651
00:38:22,232 --> 00:38:27,174
Another thing to talk about is that, again, the intersection of where logistical and pragmatic

652
00:38:27,214 --> 00:38:33,137
constraints meet creativity and creative decision-making is how we end up making things just become

653
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:35,359
what they are and that optimize the situation.

654
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:36,659
So again, embracing the constraints.

655
00:38:37,139 --> 00:38:38,300
I'm going to say it many more times.

656
00:38:39,101 --> 00:38:43,183
And the fact that the score became so broadly aleatoric is...

657
00:38:45,045 --> 00:38:48,907
is part of this because I mentioned before I couldn't record with clicks,

658
00:38:48,988 --> 00:38:53,730
which meant that every time there was a kind of a layering system

659
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:57,132
where energy level is getting more crazy in the middle of combat,

660
00:38:57,172 --> 00:38:59,153
I didn't have a good way to pivot amongst these layers

661
00:38:59,193 --> 00:39:02,035
because I knew they wouldn't actually be able to loop and sync and crossfade

662
00:39:02,055 --> 00:39:03,516
and do the traditional things that we would do.

663
00:39:04,236 --> 00:39:05,977
And so it became like, well, what if I just created,

664
00:39:06,037 --> 00:39:07,958
I just did after we recorded the main cues,

665
00:39:07,998 --> 00:39:10,700
I took 20 minutes and recorded a whole library of custom

666
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,761
sort of aleatoric clouds and effects.

667
00:39:13,594 --> 00:39:17,076
that I could use to smear these very imprecise transitions

668
00:39:17,116 --> 00:39:18,918
from one performance and one take to another.

669
00:39:19,638 --> 00:39:20,579
And then it just became like,

670
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:22,600
well, I think just aleatory can be kind of

671
00:39:26,323 --> 00:39:28,644
an aesthetic mainstay of the score itself.

672
00:39:28,684 --> 00:39:30,365
In fact, I remember someone on Twitter wrote something like,

673
00:39:30,465 --> 00:39:30,886
it's as if,

674
00:39:33,087 --> 00:39:33,628
how'd they phrase it?

675
00:39:33,648 --> 00:39:35,649
It was like, it was as if Lord of the Rings

676
00:39:35,669 --> 00:39:37,610
had a baby with the Matrix or something like that,

677
00:39:38,631 --> 00:39:39,492
which was awesome.

678
00:39:40,532 --> 00:39:43,094
And so, to give you an example of an extreme,

679
00:39:44,138 --> 00:39:48,862
In this queue, you can hear how it all flies together.

680
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:57,129
This here is what you're about to hear.

681
00:39:57,149 --> 00:39:59,611
So like the trumpets, for example, this gesture.

682
00:39:59,631 --> 00:40:00,072
Winds.

683
00:40:22,782 --> 00:40:24,063
And there's that melody again.

684
00:40:27,685 --> 00:40:30,126
So yeah, you can also see that by the third game,

685
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:32,707
I'd also kind of abandoned the idea of it's quiet and somber

686
00:40:32,747 --> 00:40:33,987
and it's heavy without being loud.

687
00:40:34,488 --> 00:40:35,288
It's like, ah, fuck that.

688
00:40:35,408 --> 00:40:36,048
Fortissimo.

689
00:40:37,329 --> 00:40:41,131
And so just a quick notion of how we implemented it.

690
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:42,411
I already just kind of touched on that.

691
00:40:42,451 --> 00:40:45,332
But because we couldn't do traditional sort

692
00:40:45,352 --> 00:40:47,914
of stacked stems and layerings and the kind of things

693
00:40:47,934 --> 00:40:50,355
that we would typically do in a game like this,

694
00:40:51,486 --> 00:40:52,526
had to come up with another system.

695
00:40:52,566 --> 00:40:55,567
But then also, the gameplay itself really informed what to do here,

696
00:40:55,607 --> 00:40:58,388
because I playtested the game, as I mentioned earlier, quite extensively.

697
00:40:59,088 --> 00:41:01,709
And one of the things that I realized is that, especially the combat,

698
00:41:02,049 --> 00:41:04,550
where most of this discussion is taking place,

699
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,731
happens in a very slow way.

700
00:41:07,831 --> 00:41:10,151
It's not a real-time thing.

701
00:41:10,191 --> 00:41:12,232
It's turn-based strategy, and it very much moves...

702
00:41:12,312 --> 00:41:15,393
It's unlike, say, XCOM, which is, in my opinion,

703
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,873
XCOM is basically turn-based strategy, the new one.

704
00:41:19,023 --> 00:41:21,045
the new reboot recently, the last few years.

705
00:41:22,666 --> 00:41:25,229
It's essentially turn-based strategy trying to convince you that it's real-time.

706
00:41:25,429 --> 00:41:28,471
Because, you know, it's like the score is super turbo-charged

707
00:41:28,531 --> 00:41:31,534
and the animations have really quick cycles

708
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:36,338
and it's trying to be as, you know, sort of StarCraft-y or whatever as possible,

709
00:41:37,059 --> 00:41:38,020
in my estimation.

710
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,301
And Bannersaga said, no, let's go for something more methodical.

711
00:41:40,362 --> 00:41:43,344
So this is sort of what it looks like to play combat in the game.

712
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:49,830
No?

713
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:51,730
Yeah, OK, I'll click that.

714
00:41:52,831 --> 00:41:54,851
It's not an exciting thing to watch, probably not

715
00:41:54,911 --> 00:41:56,291
good for Twitch streaming.

716
00:41:58,132 --> 00:42:00,873
And so I realized that if the music is overly agitated

717
00:42:00,913 --> 00:42:02,333
and overly crazy, it's really going

718
00:42:02,373 --> 00:42:05,214
against the sort of inward and introspective thing

719
00:42:05,234 --> 00:42:06,274
that you're experiencing.

720
00:42:06,374 --> 00:42:08,815
And then also, it's all very algorithmic.

721
00:42:08,875 --> 00:42:11,415
And very specifically, it's arithmetic.

722
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:15,196
There's very simple 5 plus 4 sort of math

723
00:42:15,236 --> 00:42:17,697
underneath the hood driving the in-game stats, which is what

724
00:42:17,717 --> 00:42:18,637
we hooked all the music to.

725
00:42:19,067 --> 00:42:21,989
not gonna get crazy into that right now but the bottom line is that we were able

726
00:42:22,009 --> 00:42:25,631
to track using very simple metrics if the player is effectively winning or

727
00:42:25,691 --> 00:42:29,313
losing at any given moment and wrap the implementation around that well the thing

728
00:42:29,393 --> 00:42:32,474
is if someone spends five minutes trying to make a decision about their next move

729
00:42:32,734 --> 00:42:35,816
and they click it and the system instantly knows even before the

730
00:42:35,876 --> 00:42:38,598
animation fully plays itself out if they are now

731
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:42,740
Losing or winning and if that was sort of a good decision. So if the music

732
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:49,084
Immediately gives feedback on that. It's actually extremely distracting because you spend all this time and then decide, okay

733
00:42:49,104 --> 00:42:55,728
You know what? I'm gonna rotate this here and if the system immediately is like, ah, you done fuck up you're sitting there like well shit

734
00:42:55,768 --> 00:43:02,892
I yeah, you need you need it to unfold more gradually so that it's an emergent sort of gut feeling and so I realized

735
00:43:03,673 --> 00:43:08,079
We should very rarely ever pivot in the middle of this sort of cycle of the loop.

736
00:43:08,299 --> 00:43:15,268
So think of it more like a turnstile where you make a decision and downstream the track clicks to the left or to the right

737
00:43:15,308 --> 00:43:19,093
depending on where it's going to go next, but the loop had to play itself entirely out.

738
00:43:20,035 --> 00:43:21,797
And so the reason I brought up the...

739
00:43:22,968 --> 00:43:25,149
lack of click track so many times is it led to a thing like this.

740
00:43:25,209 --> 00:43:26,989
So I would create multi-layered cues,

741
00:43:27,029 --> 00:43:29,150
but we would have to record different performances of it,

742
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:30,070
not just stack.

743
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:33,191
So here's a combat cue from the end of the first game

744
00:43:33,451 --> 00:43:35,631
where it's built very much around the bassoons.

745
00:43:35,851 --> 00:43:38,472
Because, you know, when am I ever going to get to do that again?

746
00:43:39,572 --> 00:43:41,592
So that, you heard, like, I kind of was talking over it,

747
00:43:41,612 --> 00:43:42,993
but you get this, this, uh...

748
00:43:43,113 --> 00:43:43,213
Uh...

749
00:43:43,233 --> 00:43:43,773
Behave yourself.

750
00:43:43,853 --> 00:43:43,993
Uh...

751
00:43:44,013 --> 00:43:44,973
It's kind of understated.

752
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:59,589
Alright, okay, so then layer two, I had the charts marked, you can kind of see, it says

753
00:43:59,669 --> 00:44:01,109
layer two on the conductor score.

754
00:44:01,149 --> 00:44:04,891
So I would tell the musicians, if it says layer two, don't play this next take.

755
00:44:05,432 --> 00:44:06,252
We're doing layer one.

756
00:44:06,932 --> 00:44:07,793
And so they would just sit there.

757
00:44:08,213 --> 00:44:11,575
And then come do layer two, and now, you know, the trumpets...

758
00:44:11,695 --> 00:44:14,977
It's trying to get ahead of me.

759
00:44:15,859 --> 00:44:21,483
The trumpets become the dominant chattering voice, but you'll notice the bassoons are still there. It's not a stem

760
00:44:22,324 --> 00:44:25,547
They're just playing a little more quietly now because they know they're not in charge

761
00:44:25,567 --> 00:44:28,249
So I'm able to actually shape it musically, which was really cool

762
00:44:28,309 --> 00:44:30,671
And then of course that by the time you get to the third layer

763
00:44:45,312 --> 00:44:46,333
You get the idea.

764
00:44:46,453 --> 00:44:50,017
So it led to a lot of, that whole concept led to all kinds of choices that would never

765
00:44:50,097 --> 00:44:51,779
in a million years have made.

766
00:45:05,795 --> 00:45:09,236
I'm going to skip some things because I really don't want to run out of time and I really

767
00:45:09,256 --> 00:45:11,877
don't want to run out of time for questions and I'm already flirting with both of those

768
00:45:11,897 --> 00:45:12,717
things rather dramatically.

769
00:45:13,097 --> 00:45:16,998
So I want to pivot to the logistic side and do a real crash course.

770
00:45:17,058 --> 00:45:21,980
So I will open up the hood here fairly transparently.

771
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,380
Of course I leave off specific numbers.

772
00:45:25,215 --> 00:45:27,278
This is the budget on the first game that I had to work with.

773
00:45:27,318 --> 00:45:28,239
This is my music budget.

774
00:45:28,259 --> 00:45:32,364
And you'll see I spent solidly half the money on hiring the orchestra.

775
00:45:32,785 --> 00:45:36,229
And I pulled all kinds of favors on this.

776
00:45:36,309 --> 00:45:38,291
I parlayed all kinds of favors to make this happen.

777
00:45:38,311 --> 00:45:41,796
Because we were, like I said, this is an indie game financed on Kickstarter.

778
00:45:42,096 --> 00:45:45,200
You know, there are AAA games whose music budget dwarfs the entire budget.

779
00:45:45,737 --> 00:45:47,218
of what this game had to offer.

780
00:45:47,238 --> 00:45:50,980
But they did give me a kind of disproportionate amount of there.

781
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,221
I mean, I had a six-figure number to work with,

782
00:45:54,201 --> 00:45:57,903
which was very outsized relative to the proportion

783
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:58,763
one would typically have.

784
00:45:59,544 --> 00:46:02,365
But here was the thing is I realized as much as they were offering,

785
00:46:02,565 --> 00:46:05,166
there wasn't enough to do a big, grandiose score,

786
00:46:06,707 --> 00:46:09,168
unless I was willing to not get paid.

787
00:46:09,848 --> 00:46:12,270
And so I basically said...

788
00:46:13,001 --> 00:46:14,161
here's the gamble I'm gonna make.

789
00:46:14,662 --> 00:46:16,902
I'm gonna make an exclusively back-end deal

790
00:46:17,002 --> 00:46:20,043
with these guys, and we'll put everything

791
00:46:20,083 --> 00:46:21,904
that they have to offer into the production of the score,

792
00:46:22,264 --> 00:46:24,405
so that I'm taking the exact same risk

793
00:46:24,445 --> 00:46:25,585
that they are as developers,

794
00:46:25,645 --> 00:46:27,906
because these guys put all of their savings

795
00:46:28,186 --> 00:46:29,667
for two years into making this project.

796
00:46:29,687 --> 00:46:31,047
They received zero money.

797
00:46:31,087 --> 00:46:32,628
They used none of the Kickstarter money

798
00:46:32,668 --> 00:46:33,968
to pay for their life expenses,

799
00:46:33,988 --> 00:46:36,529
and all three of these guys were married,

800
00:46:36,589 --> 00:46:38,790
had families, children in school, all that kind of stuff,

801
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:39,810
and they said, now we're all in,

802
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:41,131
and I have this philosophical idea

803
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,131
of not wanting to be.

804
00:46:42,644 --> 00:46:44,965
living a different life from the people I'm collaborating with.

805
00:46:45,005 --> 00:46:49,248
And so I thought, well, if they pay me and I'm very comfortable and luxuriously off of

806
00:46:49,288 --> 00:46:53,270
their Kickstarter money, and they're all meanwhile saying, if this game fails, we have to like

807
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:55,752
go flip burgers or something.

808
00:46:56,552 --> 00:47:00,614
Because they burned their bridges in their previous job, and they put all their eggs

809
00:47:00,634 --> 00:47:01,175
in this basket.

810
00:47:01,195 --> 00:47:03,436
So I said, I think the score should live in that same headspace.

811
00:47:03,876 --> 00:47:04,557
So it was like, OK.

812
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:09,632
give me a profit participation, a revenue share on the game itself,

813
00:47:10,173 --> 00:47:12,515
and total control over the soundtrack album,

814
00:47:12,535 --> 00:47:15,878
and in exchange, every single dime, and as it turns out, more than that,

815
00:47:15,898 --> 00:47:19,562
because I just get overexcited and start putting my own money into the score,

816
00:47:19,902 --> 00:47:23,125
is going to go into making this thing sound as great as it possibly can.

817
00:47:23,506 --> 00:47:25,828
But the first one was still a very tight situation,

818
00:47:25,848 --> 00:47:27,049
so I'm pulling all kinds of favors,

819
00:47:27,089 --> 00:47:29,572
which is why the orchestra so heavily dominates.

820
00:47:29,592 --> 00:47:30,713
By the time we get to the second one...

821
00:47:31,561 --> 00:47:35,806
Had a little bit more to work with and also the first game did really really well

822
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:39,569
And so it emboldened this strategy, so I said guys same proposition

823
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:44,975
And so but this time things were a little bit more balanced. You'll see the soloists are you know a sizable punch

824
00:47:46,436 --> 00:47:52,202
Something I always am telling people never ever ever under budget this big yellow one at the bottom music prep the sheer amount of copying

825
00:47:52,262 --> 00:47:54,304
And part prep and librarian work

826
00:47:54,869 --> 00:47:56,009
Never, never under budget that.

827
00:47:56,029 --> 00:47:58,290
That's exactly how things go to hell on the scoring stage,

828
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:01,511
especially on a thing like this where you're recording with non-traditional ensembles.

829
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:03,712
You know, in London, they have an infrastructure,

830
00:48:03,732 --> 00:48:05,893
but Colorado Symphony and the Dallas Wind Symphony,

831
00:48:06,253 --> 00:48:09,494
you have to show up with your shit together really, really, really solidly,

832
00:48:09,534 --> 00:48:11,255
or it will go to hell because no one there can help you.

833
00:48:11,715 --> 00:48:13,575
They are clueless and it's like,

834
00:48:13,635 --> 00:48:15,776
just sit down and play the notes and I have to handle everything else.

835
00:48:17,669 --> 00:48:21,911
And the third game in London obviously we were able to do things, this is a little bit

836
00:48:21,951 --> 00:48:25,192
more of a traditional make up but it was a similar kind of proportion.

837
00:48:26,012 --> 00:48:29,153
And so it gives you a sense, the entire thing was predicated on taking this risk with these

838
00:48:29,193 --> 00:48:29,433
guys.

839
00:48:29,693 --> 00:48:33,574
Now I'm fully aware that not everyone is going to necessarily be in the same position to

840
00:48:33,614 --> 00:48:36,135
be able to do that but, so you know, you do you.

841
00:48:37,395 --> 00:48:45,158
No coercion meant or suggested, and no, I'm not trying to say this is how it ought to be done.

842
00:48:45,238 --> 00:48:48,160
In fact, I'm sure there are composer colleagues of mine that would say what I did was sort

843
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:53,002
of professionally irresponsible because it creates the precedent that I would.

844
00:48:53,298 --> 00:48:56,279
effectively work for free except that I would challenge that and say I was not

845
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,739
working for free at all I damn well expected to get that profit

846
00:48:58,779 --> 00:49:01,480
participation especially because I believed in the game I thought they were

847
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,440
making something really brilliant and I said I'm willing to take this ride with

848
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:09,041
you and in exchange let's put the you know however many many tens of thousands

849
00:49:09,061 --> 00:49:12,142
that you're willing to spend on the score I want all of that to be heard

850
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:16,103
through the speakers because that's going to be how this game is what you're

851
00:49:16,143 --> 00:49:19,324
doing the equivalent of in your art direction and in your game mechanics and

852
00:49:19,344 --> 00:49:20,164
all that's how to make it

853
00:49:20,912 --> 00:49:24,833
come to life. And you know, three for three games, it was a wise decision.

854
00:49:24,873 --> 00:49:28,814
In fact, the first one did so well that if I had pocketed 100% of the money and done it all with samples,

855
00:49:28,894 --> 00:49:29,734
I would have made less.

856
00:49:31,614 --> 00:49:37,035
And so, not the case with the other two, but you never know what's going to happen with these things.

857
00:49:37,095 --> 00:49:40,996
And so they were razor-thin margins. I had to pull a lot of favors on all three games.

858
00:49:42,016 --> 00:49:44,317
But I think it was worth it because at the end of the day,

859
00:49:44,377 --> 00:49:46,817
I care more about having a final product that I'm really, really...

860
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:51,694
proud of. To give you an example of the kind of deal that was made is the orchestra in

861
00:49:51,734 --> 00:49:55,497
Dallas, they had a recording engineer they had a long history with and a record label

862
00:49:55,517 --> 00:49:59,340
that they had done albums with. So I went to them and I said, look, I can't really afford

863
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:04,844
to pay your engineer. I have no extra budget for your engineering crew. So how about this?

864
00:50:04,944 --> 00:50:09,148
If you front those costs, your label gets to release the soundtrack album and you will

865
00:50:09,188 --> 00:50:09,668
make 100% of the initial

866
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:14,893
however much, whatever it takes to recoup your engineering costs plus interest.

867
00:50:15,293 --> 00:50:18,575
Then from that point, it's stair steps until eventually we're 50-50 partners.

868
00:50:18,875 --> 00:50:24,359
So that I'm incentivizing them to sell the hell out of this album and they're joining

869
00:50:24,399 --> 00:50:24,999
the risk with me.

870
00:50:25,019 --> 00:50:27,401
And they said, absolutely, let's do it.

871
00:50:27,601 --> 00:50:31,363
And the really cool thing with that was that they do these super high fidelity surround

872
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:32,384
sound albums and 192K ridiculous...

873
00:50:35,019 --> 00:50:37,180
ultra-detailed classical recordings,

874
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,740
and so as part of their normal marketing,

875
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,161
they sent it out to all these audiophile sites.

876
00:50:41,181 --> 00:50:43,682
And so to this day, I get Google alerts

877
00:50:43,722 --> 00:50:46,163
of the Banner Saga being reviewed on websites

878
00:50:46,183 --> 00:50:47,524
that know nothing about games,

879
00:50:47,584 --> 00:50:49,044
but they're like, they're saying,

880
00:50:49,064 --> 00:50:50,925
this album just sounds really great,

881
00:50:50,945 --> 00:50:52,405
and we're reviewing,

882
00:50:52,425 --> 00:50:53,846
and there's one reviewer in particular

883
00:50:54,126 --> 00:50:55,607
that reviews speaker systems,

884
00:50:55,627 --> 00:50:57,387
and he always uses this album as his test.

885
00:50:57,687 --> 00:51:00,308
So it keeps showing up in reviews years and years later

886
00:51:00,628 --> 00:51:02,209
because of the nature of that deal that I made,

887
00:51:02,249 --> 00:51:02,529
and that's.

888
00:51:03,164 --> 00:51:07,286
When it comes to this notion of how to make indie sound triple A, I'm always looking,

889
00:51:07,326 --> 00:51:10,529
if I'm on a project like this, always looking for what's every opportunity, who are the

890
00:51:10,549 --> 00:51:14,091
people involved, what talents do they bring, and how do we mutually incentivize each other

891
00:51:14,131 --> 00:51:16,593
to bring something to the table where we can all do really well.

892
00:51:17,273 --> 00:51:21,856
This is all based on the philosophical precept that everyone is willing to take on risk,

893
00:51:21,897 --> 00:51:24,558
and for some people that's not possible, and for some people that's not interesting.

894
00:51:24,578 --> 00:51:25,699
They would rather just get paid.

895
00:51:27,137 --> 00:51:28,840
If that person has to be involved,

896
00:51:29,301 --> 00:51:32,487
then you carve out more money for them than the rest,

897
00:51:32,527 --> 00:51:33,910
and then everybody else gets to join

898
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:35,894
in potentially a greater windfall later,

899
00:51:35,954 --> 00:51:36,555
that kind of thing.

900
00:51:37,647 --> 00:51:43,991
And the results of course let you create something that you couldn't just write checks and make it happen.

901
00:51:44,011 --> 00:51:45,733
There's just not enough money.

902
00:51:45,793 --> 00:51:50,776
The resources on Banner Saga 3 for example had to write close to two hours of score.

903
00:51:51,076 --> 00:51:53,818
And like I said, I had one day in the studio at air.

904
00:51:54,098 --> 00:51:56,680
So I said, okay, I'm going to be able to get about an hour and ten music,

905
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,082
which is an insane pace to do in a single day.

906
00:51:59,582 --> 00:52:02,784
But like I said, aforementioned, London musicians are not human.

907
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:06,100
And that time I was like, yeah, we're gonna use a click.

908
00:52:07,021 --> 00:52:09,281
We're gonna speed this process up a bit.

909
00:52:09,821 --> 00:52:11,602
But I told them, you know,

910
00:52:11,622 --> 00:52:14,263
we're gonna make this very ensembly, but we gotta move.

911
00:52:14,723 --> 00:52:16,203
And so then it's like,

912
00:52:16,243 --> 00:52:18,784
how do I get another almost hour of music out of this?

913
00:52:18,824 --> 00:52:20,524
And that's how you bring all those other strategies of,

914
00:52:20,564 --> 00:52:24,325
well, if I just hear a singer alone acapella for a minute.

915
00:52:24,758 --> 00:52:28,119
you can create a really evocative and interesting piece of music and no player says,

916
00:52:28,419 --> 00:52:31,360
where's the orchestra? This is so cheap.

917
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:32,820
You don't have that problem.

918
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,020
So I was able to parse things out,

919
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:38,341
which is a lesson I had first learned on journey really.

920
00:52:38,361 --> 00:52:41,202
So built around these cello solos with a very limited orchestral budget,

921
00:52:41,722 --> 00:52:43,262
but didn't really internalize till here.

922
00:52:43,442 --> 00:52:45,982
So anyway, I know I'm moving very quickly and haphazardly,

923
00:52:46,022 --> 00:52:47,883
but I just wanted to share some of these things because I

924
00:52:47,943 --> 00:52:51,343
really I was changed as a composer in person by working on this.

925
00:52:51,933 --> 00:52:55,334
Franchise I think that these guys who made it are

926
00:52:56,114 --> 00:53:00,075
Really really really amazing people and really amazing game developers, and it was really privileged

927
00:53:00,835 --> 00:53:02,876
experience to work with them and

928
00:53:03,256 --> 00:53:04,896
so that's why for me the big takeaway of

929
00:53:05,796 --> 00:53:10,077
Diving in and meeting them at the same level of their risk and just saying okay screw it

930
00:53:10,457 --> 00:53:12,237
No one here is getting paid unless it does well

931
00:53:12,277 --> 00:53:14,098
Let's all just try to make something beautiful together

932
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:19,079
I ended up being one of the best experiences I've ever had may may may never be taught frankly

933
00:53:19,159 --> 00:53:20,559
It was so creatively free and

934
00:53:21,321 --> 00:53:27,724
and wonderful and predicated on doing this, but as a result was able to make Indy sound

935
00:53:27,764 --> 00:53:34,686
at least quasi AAA. With that said, I have a few minutes to take any questions. I have

936
00:53:34,726 --> 00:53:38,748
less time than I would like, so if there's anything, I know we have a mic here, and I'm

937
00:53:38,788 --> 00:53:44,350
happy to dive straight into it. And if you ask no questions, it means I have utterly

938
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:49,492
failed to be provocative and say anything interesting, and I expect your reviews to

939
00:53:49,572 --> 00:53:50,293
reflect that fact.

940
00:53:50,749 --> 00:53:53,611
So, all right, kicking it off.

941
00:53:54,953 --> 00:53:55,453
Hi, thanks.

942
00:53:55,593 --> 00:53:56,674
This was great.

943
00:53:58,355 --> 00:54:00,937
So for Banner Saga 3, did you say for that,

944
00:54:00,977 --> 00:54:02,338
you did use a click?

945
00:54:03,079 --> 00:54:04,300
Yeah.

946
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:06,041
Just for sake of efficiency.

947
00:54:06,562 --> 00:54:09,124
And just random detail, I noticed

948
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:12,627
that you had fewer clarinets.

949
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:18,752
more bassoons for that? I'm just curious if that was a creative decision.

950
00:54:18,952 --> 00:54:24,374
I had, well every penny counted, so I had to make a few decisions where I limited very

951
00:54:24,454 --> 00:54:28,175
specific things just to kind of shrink where I could. You know, I had only one timpanist,

952
00:54:28,195 --> 00:54:32,857
for example, that kind of thing. But that was just, like, where can I make a cut that's,

953
00:54:33,177 --> 00:54:37,379
you know, in aggregate will show up and help but won't really affect the overall sound,

954
00:54:37,439 --> 00:54:42,100
especially if I write conscientiously to avoid duplicating gestures. And so yeah, it was a couple

955
00:54:42,887 --> 00:54:46,268
Generally the same, but a couple little differences.

956
00:54:46,588 --> 00:54:47,488
Yeah, cool, thanks.

957
00:54:47,908 --> 00:54:48,429
Yeah, of course.

958
00:54:50,429 --> 00:54:51,809
Hi, thanks for the amazing talk.

959
00:54:52,409 --> 00:54:53,870
I really liked the bit about where you got

960
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:55,510
all these weird instruments in.

961
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:58,331
So I just wanted to ask, do you have ideas

962
00:54:58,431 --> 00:54:59,711
and then the instruments come in?

963
00:55:00,131 --> 00:55:02,432
Or do these instruments then dictate your ideas?

964
00:55:02,652 --> 00:55:03,992
And if that can ever be negative.

965
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,081
just because you have this crazy horn,

966
00:55:06,201 --> 00:55:07,242
do you have to then use it?

967
00:55:07,522 --> 00:55:08,183
Yeah, right.

968
00:55:08,403 --> 00:55:09,604
And it's a good question,

969
00:55:09,644 --> 00:55:12,726
because the corollary question that comes up a lot is,

970
00:55:13,186 --> 00:55:15,408
do you write to the strengths of your sample libraries,

971
00:55:15,828 --> 00:55:19,090
or do you write trying to make the samples

972
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,251
transcend themselves,

973
00:55:20,331 --> 00:55:22,372
knowing that the mock-up may suffer as a result?

974
00:55:22,432 --> 00:55:24,874
And I'm a big fan of not limiting,

975
00:55:25,354 --> 00:55:27,515
the tools are there, truly as tools,

976
00:55:27,575 --> 00:55:29,457
let your imagination be as unbridled as possible.

977
00:55:29,537 --> 00:55:30,357
But there's no question that,

978
00:55:30,617 --> 00:55:32,018
if it's a super esoteric instrument,

979
00:55:32,768 --> 00:55:35,973
it will do things better than other things.

980
00:55:36,013 --> 00:55:41,061
So if I just write for it in some abstract way, absent what it does best, I may not be

981
00:55:41,181 --> 00:55:44,467
using it to its most effective capacity.

982
00:55:44,787 --> 00:55:46,550
Of course I may also be missing the opportunity...

983
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:49,670
I think if Stravinsky had regarded the bassoon

984
00:55:49,690 --> 00:55:51,891
in only its stereotypical way,

985
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:53,631
we would never have had the opening of The Rite of Spring,

986
00:55:53,671 --> 00:55:55,372
which no one had ever heard a bassoon really play

987
00:55:55,392 --> 00:55:58,393
that high and gently and weirdly lyrically like that.

988
00:55:58,473 --> 00:56:02,694
And so it's sort of a tug of war between these two poles.

989
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:04,474
In the specific case, for example, of the bucca horn,

990
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:06,395
the weird lamb's horn, I think, and literally,

991
00:56:06,415 --> 00:56:10,436
it only plays a kind of quasi-modal F-sharp minor

992
00:56:10,456 --> 00:56:12,877
that is not at all based around like an A440-derived.

993
00:56:15,051 --> 00:56:19,855
It's just kind of like, yeah, this is the closest note to F sharp that I would call that sound.

994
00:56:20,956 --> 00:56:24,559
And so yes, I very quickly realized I have to write to what this thing can do.

995
00:56:24,579 --> 00:56:28,802
Because I can, one note wrong, if I write a G natural, he'll go, I can't do it.

996
00:56:29,723 --> 00:56:36,729
You know, so that very much did dictate a lot of what I was doing in certain areas.

997
00:56:37,249 --> 00:56:39,971
And then in others, you know, I did every once in a while say, I'm going to cheat

998
00:56:40,031 --> 00:56:43,154
and melodyne this thing to be what it needs to be.

999
00:56:44,137 --> 00:56:49,241
and record it, I'd write it half step off from where I wanted it and then just nudge it, that kind of thing.

1000
00:56:49,722 --> 00:56:56,187
Move it in its entirety so it's still all weird and out of tune, but it's just weird and out of tune in like G minor instead of F sharp minor.

1001
00:56:57,688 --> 00:56:59,830
So yeah, does that kind of answer your question?

1002
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:00,271
Yeah, thank you.

1003
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:01,071
Good, thank you.

1004
00:57:01,892 --> 00:57:04,494
Thank you. Did the conductor also not have a click?

1005
00:57:06,716 --> 00:57:12,100
So it varied. On the first game, basically, I split the conducting in half with Jerry.

1006
00:57:13,057 --> 00:57:15,139
and I did all the rest of it myself on the second and third.

1007
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:18,363
On the second one, I did have a click,

1008
00:57:18,383 --> 00:57:19,524
but the musicians did not,

1009
00:57:19,584 --> 00:57:20,966
and on the third one, everybody did.

1010
00:57:21,046 --> 00:57:23,408
So it was kind of like every possible scenario of none,

1011
00:57:24,369 --> 00:57:25,871
conductor only, everybody.

1012
00:57:26,267 --> 00:57:28,829
Okay, and the first one too, no click?

1013
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:30,130
Yeah, not really.

1014
00:57:30,171 --> 00:57:32,873
I mean, we did run a cable out to the booth,

1015
00:57:32,953 --> 00:57:35,055
but half the time I would, and I'd just say screw it,

1016
00:57:35,115 --> 00:57:37,276
it's just too, I would rather be more present

1017
00:57:37,296 --> 00:57:40,599
with the musicians and just do this that way,

1018
00:57:40,759 --> 00:57:42,581
own this environment, own this situation

1019
00:57:42,641 --> 00:57:45,043
instead of trying to be half in one world

1020
00:57:45,083 --> 00:57:45,924
and half in another.

1021
00:57:45,944 --> 00:57:46,844
Cool, thank you.

1022
00:57:47,325 --> 00:57:47,845
Yeah, sure.

1023
00:57:49,177 --> 00:57:51,537
This is a question about budgets in general.

1024
00:57:52,237 --> 00:57:56,278
How much do you feel like the audio budget should be out of a total production budget

1025
00:57:56,298 --> 00:57:58,559
for indie up to AAA and does that percentage change?

1026
00:57:58,579 --> 00:57:59,339
Indie up to AAA?

1027
00:57:59,439 --> 00:57:59,879
Good lord.

1028
00:58:00,479 --> 00:58:02,979
Is this like the start of hour two of my talk?

1029
00:58:02,999 --> 00:58:04,180
No, like what's the range?

1030
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:06,840
Like would you go from 10% for indie up to like 30% for...

1031
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:07,800
I hear people...

1032
00:58:08,441 --> 00:58:08,581
I...

1033
00:58:08,701 --> 00:58:10,681
My answer to that is always I'll take what you got.

1034
00:58:11,861 --> 00:58:12,782
Because frankly...

1035
00:58:13,495 --> 00:58:15,115
I'm not making their game.

1036
00:58:15,196 --> 00:58:19,057
I don't consider it my place to tell them how to spend their money because they have

1037
00:58:19,077 --> 00:58:20,518
a thousand mouths to feed.

1038
00:58:20,898 --> 00:58:26,040
And so, you know, on a game like this, for example, the art direction is extremely tedious

1039
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:26,500
to make.

1040
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,922
And so they're going to need, you know, a few support artists around the main guy working

1041
00:58:30,942 --> 00:58:31,783
around the clock.

1042
00:58:31,823 --> 00:58:33,623
It's just, and it's a game that the art style is.

1043
00:58:34,324 --> 00:58:37,767
why people end up noticing it. And so, should, you know,

1044
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:44,314
theoretically, the art budget should dwarf the music budget because it's why anyone's gonna care. And so,

1045
00:58:44,995 --> 00:58:48,458
those kinds of decisions are the things that they are grappling with, and I always say to them, you know,

1046
00:58:49,937 --> 00:58:52,338
You, you know, I will work within what you've got.

1047
00:58:52,358 --> 00:58:54,520
I mean, that's kind of the main MO of the talk, right?

1048
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:57,382
Like, if you tell me you only have $100 to produce the score

1049
00:58:57,422 --> 00:58:59,324
and it's something that I feel like I have to be part of this,

1050
00:58:59,804 --> 00:59:01,265
then it's like, okay, $100,

1051
00:59:01,666 --> 00:59:02,666
there's a lot you can do with $100.

1052
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:04,708
You just gotta figure out what it is, you know?

1053
00:59:04,748 --> 00:59:07,430
Immediately, first thought is grab the Zoom recorder

1054
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:09,311
and start making weird sounds

1055
00:59:09,372 --> 00:59:11,333
and do things that don't cost that much, you know?

1056
00:59:11,373 --> 00:59:13,094
Don't require a big orchestra, that kind of thing.

1057
00:59:13,935 --> 00:59:16,237
So yeah, to me, it's, there's no one size fits all.

1058
00:59:16,317 --> 00:59:18,338
Every single production, it can even be literally like,

1059
00:59:18,919 --> 00:59:19,119
you know.

1060
00:59:19,724 --> 00:59:24,527
Far Cry 3 versus Far Cry 4 don't even have to be beholden to the same idea of how much

1061
00:59:24,547 --> 00:59:25,447
the music budget should be.

1062
00:59:26,468 --> 00:59:32,911
Even within large-scale production, AAA, and one sequel to the next, things can change

1063
00:59:32,951 --> 00:59:33,411
dramatically.

1064
00:59:33,911 --> 00:59:34,452
I'm okay.

1065
00:59:34,952 --> 00:59:35,592
I don't prescribe it.

1066
00:59:35,632 --> 00:59:36,733
I'm like, you need to spend more money.

1067
00:59:36,753 --> 00:59:39,314
The one thing that was unusual about this situation is on the first game, because of

1068
00:59:39,354 --> 00:59:41,835
the Kickstarter, they brought me on halfway through.

1069
00:59:42,196 --> 00:59:42,756
So I said to them,

1070
00:59:43,635 --> 00:59:46,697
if we make music-specific rewards for the Kickstarter,

1071
00:59:47,058 --> 00:59:50,160
can we funnel that money specifically to the score?

1072
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,583
So they had a baseline amount that they were basically willing to guarantee me,

1073
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:56,485
and then I offered things like, during the recording session,

1074
00:59:57,286 --> 01:00:00,128
you can get a signed part by a member of the orchestra who played.

1075
01:00:00,188 --> 01:00:01,669
I didn't think anyone would care about that.

1076
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:05,953
It's like 100 bucks for, you know, the third clarinetist's 4am 25 page 4.

1077
01:00:10,011 --> 01:00:14,593
And people, we made like thousands of dollars worth of selling, it was actually, it took

1078
01:00:14,613 --> 01:00:18,915
like a lot of, the musicians had to stay quite a bit after the session, sitting there like

1079
01:00:19,075 --> 01:00:19,795
god damn.

1080
01:00:21,016 --> 01:00:22,216
Actually, they thought it was really cool.

1081
01:00:23,817 --> 01:00:28,198
And so that, we were able to funnel more money into the score based on that kind of arrangement

1082
01:00:28,339 --> 01:00:31,980
because it was like, okay, well, you know, they basically said, we'll do it, now it's

1083
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:32,980
on you, go sell that.

1084
01:00:33,361 --> 01:00:38,022
So like on Twitter begging, please support this and it helped that Journey had come out

1085
01:00:38,042 --> 01:00:38,683
like a month later.

1086
01:00:39,192 --> 01:00:41,213
So there was a bit of a fervor going on.

1087
01:00:41,433 --> 01:00:45,476
And so yeah, anyway, I don't know if that fully answers your question,

1088
01:00:45,496 --> 01:00:47,757
but I don't believe in prescriptive budgeting.

1089
01:00:47,777 --> 01:00:48,658
Thanks.

1090
01:00:53,121 --> 01:00:53,822
My name is Jasmine.

1091
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:55,663
I want to say thank you for this talk.

1092
01:00:55,683 --> 01:00:56,303
I really enjoyed it.

1093
01:00:57,264 --> 01:01:02,107
I found what you said about putting all the money into production very commendable.

1094
01:01:02,342 --> 01:01:04,043
because I'm kind of in a similar position now,

1095
01:01:04,143 --> 01:01:06,125
and I wanted to ask you, were you in a position

1096
01:01:06,405 --> 01:01:07,606
that allowed you to do that?

1097
01:01:07,766 --> 01:01:10,207
Or did you have other projects going on at the time

1098
01:01:10,588 --> 01:01:12,849
that enabled you to be able to funnel all of that music,

1099
01:01:12,989 --> 01:01:16,992
all that funding into the music aspect of Banner Saga?

1100
01:01:17,332 --> 01:01:18,333
Yeah, absolutely, yes.

1101
01:01:18,373 --> 01:01:19,914
I mean, it's a two-year period.

1102
01:01:19,994 --> 01:01:22,536
I definitely had other projects that I was doing

1103
01:01:22,576 --> 01:01:25,978
that were an essential part of the ecosystem of why,

1104
01:01:26,158 --> 01:01:29,540
you end up kind of in a Ponzi scheme with yourself,

1105
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:31,642
sort of taking from here and giving it there.

1106
01:01:32,325 --> 01:01:36,927
But, you know, I don't think any of us got into this career with the idea being that

1107
01:01:36,987 --> 01:01:40,109
it's all going to be very straightforward and easy and 9 to 5 Monday to Friday.

1108
01:01:40,489 --> 01:01:42,550
Like I'm in it for the rough and tumble.

1109
01:01:42,590 --> 01:01:45,391
And so the idea was, yeah, this is a super high risk.

1110
01:01:45,731 --> 01:01:51,034
I'm turning down a lot of potential money up front in exchange for something that hopefully

1111
01:01:51,094 --> 01:01:52,034
is vastly more beautiful.

1112
01:01:53,115 --> 01:01:55,096
and far more fitting to the game.

1113
01:01:55,136 --> 01:01:59,519
It's something that, it's like I feel professionally obligated to do this in a way

1114
01:01:59,579 --> 01:02:05,822
because my goal is to make something that is perfect as I can make it for that game in this context.

1115
01:02:05,882 --> 01:02:07,984
And this path is the only way I can see to get there.

1116
01:02:08,044 --> 01:02:12,086
So it's not even that I want to, it's I feel a certain obligation that I have to.

1117
01:02:12,906 --> 01:02:14,307
And, but, yes.

1118
01:02:16,244 --> 01:02:20,487
completely and totally is predicated on having been gainfully employed in parallel to that.

1119
01:02:20,827 --> 01:02:23,489
And that can be a balancing act because you obviously don't want to shortchange the amount

1120
01:02:23,509 --> 01:02:27,132
of time you're spending on this huge risk because then it's like you're cutting your

1121
01:02:27,272 --> 01:02:31,936
own idea off at the knees if you're so busy with other stuff that this project that you're

1122
01:02:32,396 --> 01:02:36,038
taking this huge gamble on, you don't have the time to actually really flesh out.

1123
01:02:36,099 --> 01:02:39,401
So I was very lucky that I was able to survive and I was living okay.

1124
01:02:40,534 --> 01:02:42,535
but able to spend enormous amounts of time.

1125
01:02:42,595 --> 01:02:45,977
I mean, my Steam build of the game says I have like 300 hours

1126
01:02:46,017 --> 01:02:47,638
of playing the game or something like that

1127
01:02:47,658 --> 01:02:50,140
because I would just every single day try to figure out

1128
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,902
how to break it and make the music better

1129
01:02:52,962 --> 01:02:54,823
and just learn more of the lore.

1130
01:02:54,863 --> 01:02:56,384
And I'm like a huge fanboy for the game now.

1131
01:02:56,404 --> 01:03:00,207
I'm like one of those Tolkien weirdos about their thing

1132
01:03:00,227 --> 01:03:01,628
where I'm like, oh, you know that part of the map

1133
01:03:01,648 --> 01:03:02,869
where there's, what is that all about?

1134
01:03:02,889 --> 01:03:04,450
And they're like, just let it go, man.

1135
01:03:04,610 --> 01:03:05,671
And so.

1136
01:03:07,051 --> 01:03:08,972
Or they're probably at a point where they're like, we don't even know.

1137
01:03:09,052 --> 01:03:12,634
Just go start a fucking wiki yourself and put your own theories.

1138
01:03:13,974 --> 01:03:17,776
So yeah, anyway, yes, the answer is for sure.

1139
01:03:18,236 --> 01:03:21,458
And that's why I say I'm not trying to prescribe this as this is how it must be done because

1140
01:03:21,498 --> 01:03:24,899
I know I was in a very fortunate position to be able to do that.

1141
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:27,841
But that's how I was able to make.

1142
01:03:28,715 --> 01:03:30,376
Indie Sound AAA.

1143
01:03:30,416 --> 01:03:33,019
I used everything on the table in my life in general

1144
01:03:33,339 --> 01:03:35,721
to make that happen, including letting this project

1145
01:03:35,781 --> 01:03:37,843
over here finance that project over there,

1146
01:03:37,923 --> 01:03:38,724
that kind of thing.

1147
01:03:38,744 --> 01:03:40,806
My lifestyle during that project, that sort of thing.

1148
01:03:41,206 --> 01:03:42,708
Okay, all right, thank you, I appreciate it.

1149
01:03:42,728 --> 01:03:43,208
My pleasure.

1150
01:03:43,388 --> 01:03:44,189
I think I'm out of time,

1151
01:03:44,209 --> 01:03:45,930
so that was our grand finale question.

1152
01:03:49,193 --> 01:03:49,794
Thank you all.
