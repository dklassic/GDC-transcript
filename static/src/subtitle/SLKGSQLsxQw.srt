1
00:00:07,412 --> 00:00:09,314
GDC 2018, who's excited?

2
00:00:09,334 --> 00:00:12,596
Yeah, all right.

3
00:00:13,176 --> 00:00:16,819
So I'm gonna get us started with a really uplifting talk

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,121
about surviving failure.

5
00:00:22,263 --> 00:00:26,666
So I actually, this is my second time talking about this.

6
00:00:28,207 --> 00:00:30,228
Last year I gave a talk specifically on

7
00:00:30,248 --> 00:00:32,110
the technical failures of Brigador.

8
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,010
My name is Humana, and by the way,

9
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,371
I made a game called Brigador a while back.

10
00:00:35,872 --> 00:00:41,054
And if you want the like nitty gritty of all the poor decisions I made, that's the last

11
00:00:41,094 --> 00:00:41,635
year's talk.

12
00:00:42,595 --> 00:00:43,976
Something like Brigadier Failure or something.

13
00:00:44,716 --> 00:00:49,098
I hadn't yet graduated to being able to add the surviving part of the title.

14
00:00:50,098 --> 00:00:51,539
So that's why I look forward to giving this one.

15
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:55,421
I'm much more concerned here with just sort of the post.

16
00:00:56,461 --> 00:01:00,843
postpartum depression kind of period of like when you have this thing happen, how do you

17
00:01:01,004 --> 00:01:08,027
deal with it? And so as part of some research and preparation for my talk, I figured I would

18
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:12,570
look into what other people have already said, you know, because I didn't want to just repeat

19
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:18,553
what's already the combined wisdom on the internet. So I actually...

20
00:01:19,394 --> 00:01:26,099
decided to record some of the, some real helpful nuggets, um, that I found. Uh, I read an entire

21
00:01:26,199 --> 00:01:33,325
article on how to become a growth hacker, uh, to, to deal with failure. Um, I read the

22
00:01:33,365 --> 00:01:39,570
entire article and I still don't actually know what they meant. Um, another one is,

23
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:45,595
set yourself up to win no matter what. Um, I think that's just called cheating. Um,

24
00:01:47,113 --> 00:01:49,114
Again, not entirely clear on that one.

25
00:01:50,695 --> 00:01:52,276
Gamify your failure.

26
00:01:52,296 --> 00:01:57,680
You know, because game dev isn't enough of a free-to-play grind

27
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,120
as it is.

28
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,281
You want to make sure you get some real good nuggets

29
00:02:00,341 --> 00:02:00,582
in there.

30
00:02:00,922 --> 00:02:04,424
And then my absolute favorite was just

31
00:02:04,504 --> 00:02:06,886
remove absolute failure as an option.

32
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:14,175
If only I had known when I started this project that I can just not have failure as an option,

33
00:02:14,455 --> 00:02:16,157
that would have made things so much easier.

34
00:02:18,078 --> 00:02:23,283
But yeah, so just what I found was a lot of platitudes and quick tips and no one really

35
00:02:23,483 --> 00:02:27,547
acknowledging how it can just really suck sometimes to fail.

36
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:28,147
And no one...

37
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:32,349
really acknowledge that or really talks about how to deal with that.

38
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:38,270
So here to talk about how things can really suck sometimes, my name is Hugh again.

39
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:40,811
I started a company called Stellar Jockeys back in 2011.

40
00:02:41,611 --> 00:02:47,133
In the summer of 2016, we launched a game called Brigador.

41
00:02:48,593 --> 00:02:53,835
And that launch went so well, we pretended it didn't happen and just tried it again a

42
00:02:53,895 --> 00:02:54,635
year later.

43
00:02:57,356 --> 00:03:06,861
And I don't know how many of you know me personally versus, like, the game versus a certain post I wrote one time.

44
00:03:07,962 --> 00:03:12,045
Some people describe it as a meltdown. I think that's maybe a little aggressive.

45
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:16,848
But yeah, so, long story short is...

46
00:03:18,215 --> 00:03:20,577
We had a launch in summer 2016, it went poorly.

47
00:03:27,465 --> 00:03:29,387
And that's fine, like that happens.

48
00:03:29,987 --> 00:03:33,309
But I was a lot more raw coming out of that

49
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,051
than I really needed to be.

50
00:03:35,431 --> 00:03:37,232
And that dramatically affected

51
00:03:37,332 --> 00:03:39,634
the next six months of my life.

52
00:03:40,814 --> 00:03:42,856
And I also wrote some stuff on the internet,

53
00:03:43,376 --> 00:03:46,899
which was maybe a little more spicy than it needed to be.

54
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,321
But now 210,000 people have read it.

55
00:03:50,401 --> 00:03:51,762
So that's kind of a little too late

56
00:03:51,802 --> 00:03:53,263
to put the genie back in the bottle.

57
00:03:55,309 --> 00:03:56,890
But yeah, so why did I feel so burned?

58
00:03:58,851 --> 00:04:01,852
I did, and accidentally, there were just a lot of things.

59
00:04:02,192 --> 00:04:03,533
It was my first time shipping a game,

60
00:04:03,613 --> 00:04:05,374
and my first time really committing

61
00:04:05,494 --> 00:04:09,135
to an experience of that kind of magnitude.

62
00:04:09,155 --> 00:04:12,237
I mean, the only other thing really commensurate to game dev,

63
00:04:12,257 --> 00:04:13,517
especially when you're young.

64
00:04:13,697 --> 00:04:14,798
We started working on Brigador when I was 23.

65
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:18,259
It was like going through college,

66
00:04:18,719 --> 00:04:22,601
and there's other things to help relax you on that.

67
00:04:24,773 --> 00:04:27,116
So one of the biggest things is expectation versus reality.

68
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:35,306
And for me, there was a huge gap between what I expected

69
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:38,230
for the launch of Brigador and what the reality was.

70
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:44,054
It's natural for, though, there to be a disparity there.

71
00:04:45,215 --> 00:04:47,397
And one of the kind of frustrating ironies

72
00:04:47,597 --> 00:04:49,960
of being a more experienced developer

73
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,185
is that you learn to better attune yourself to,

74
00:04:54,725 --> 00:04:58,009
like, attune those expectations to what is likely to happen.

75
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,000
But what ends up happening is that at some point,

76
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,841
there's a moment of reckoning.

77
00:05:04,802 --> 00:05:07,723
Or maybe if you're lucky, like a period of time

78
00:05:07,903 --> 00:05:10,764
in which those two things come together.

79
00:05:12,165 --> 00:05:14,166
And if that happens very quickly,

80
00:05:14,286 --> 00:05:15,887
like with a game launch when you have

81
00:05:15,907 --> 00:05:17,528
this kind of catastrophic realization

82
00:05:17,588 --> 00:05:23,711
that I've made a huge mistake, then that can be very jarring.

83
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:25,371
Ideally.

84
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:31,873
Making that shift should be either it's a small shift

85
00:05:32,113 --> 00:05:33,655
and it's going to be a soft experience

86
00:05:34,996 --> 00:05:39,039
or you have enough time to gradually bridge the gap.

87
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:41,461
What happened to me in 2016 was more something like this.

88
00:05:45,995 --> 00:05:49,136
So there's actually a great film called 500 Days of Summer.

89
00:05:51,137 --> 00:05:54,157
And it's a great movie on the whole,

90
00:05:54,197 --> 00:05:57,898
but there's also a segment that's a few minutes long

91
00:05:58,498 --> 00:06:05,000
that I think very succinctly just describes and illustrates

92
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,661
not only the difference there, but the impact

93
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,521
that that can have.

94
00:06:12,006 --> 00:06:15,008
The caveat here is that it's not that we shouldn't just

95
00:06:15,088 --> 00:06:16,369
lower our expectations.

96
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:18,430
I'm not telling anyone to do that.

97
00:06:19,831 --> 00:06:22,973
But I think there's kind of a third step you can add,

98
00:06:23,053 --> 00:06:26,375
which is aspiration versus expectation versus reality.

99
00:06:26,835 --> 00:06:28,276
We can aspire to be the best.

100
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:31,998
And there's nothing wrong with striving for that.

101
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:35,981
But you need that kind of middle ground of, OK,

102
00:06:36,401 --> 00:06:37,302
what's actually going to happen?

103
00:06:37,322 --> 00:06:38,943
Because if you don't protect yourself with that,

104
00:06:39,543 --> 00:06:45,149
then you can end up with this kind of whiplash that happens

105
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:46,590
when you have to reconcile those things.

106
00:06:48,838 --> 00:06:54,423
So the second thing that I did was that I, because I put everything into the launch,

107
00:06:55,504 --> 00:07:00,829
and I sort of just assumed that things were going to go well enough that I would be fine,

108
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:05,072
when it didn't, I had nothing left in the tank to help cope with the failure.

109
00:07:05,213 --> 00:07:10,057
So I was just sort of stuck in this awkward situation afterwards.

110
00:07:11,738 --> 00:07:12,699
And I wasn't...

111
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:22,765
I got into this cycle where any time I was getting into any kind of recovery, any energy

112
00:07:22,785 --> 00:07:28,689
that I was getting back, any joie de vivre, was immediately spent on working on the game.

113
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:34,233
So as soon as I got any of that back, I would burn real hard for like a day or a week or

114
00:07:34,273 --> 00:07:37,235
a month or like however long that I had that juice going for.

115
00:07:37,255 --> 00:07:41,198
And then I would put myself right back to where I was the day after that launch.

116
00:07:44,016 --> 00:07:47,037
And the third thing is that I was,

117
00:07:48,558 --> 00:07:50,198
you know, we talk about, you know,

118
00:07:50,258 --> 00:07:52,019
burnout and crunch and a lot of these things.

119
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,121
It's different to be faced with that yourself

120
00:07:57,421 --> 00:08:00,062
and then to have to actually acknowledge

121
00:08:00,102 --> 00:08:03,263
that, you know, I'm not able to work

122
00:08:03,423 --> 00:08:07,965
or, you know, to continue at this level of performance

123
00:08:07,985 --> 00:08:09,845
that I had been going on for a while.

124
00:08:11,246 --> 00:08:14,647
Because it's kind of a frustrating thing to admit.

125
00:08:15,747 --> 00:08:18,467
And in that period afterward, I was like,

126
00:08:18,768 --> 00:08:19,868
I'm just going to keep working the way

127
00:08:19,888 --> 00:08:21,228
I have been for the last couple years.

128
00:08:22,088 --> 00:08:25,709
And I couldn't accept that it's just so OK to have a hard time.

129
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:29,090
You need to have that kind of down period

130
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:33,031
where if you go through an experience like a really

131
00:08:33,071 --> 00:08:36,071
bad launch that you spent five years on,

132
00:08:37,972 --> 00:08:40,914
there's gonna be, like you need time for that fallout

133
00:08:40,934 --> 00:08:44,037
to settle and to give yourself a chance to recover.

134
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:47,000
When you go through an experience like that,

135
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,342
you have two jobs, which is to get better,

136
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,025
and it was what I described with

137
00:08:52,445 --> 00:08:54,147
don't like immediately burn yourself back out,

138
00:08:54,487 --> 00:08:56,008
and also don't make things worse.

139
00:08:57,699 --> 00:09:00,981
I got real close with that post that I showed earlier.

140
00:09:01,482 --> 00:09:04,304
If that had been tonally a little bit different, or maybe

141
00:09:04,364 --> 00:09:06,706
under different circumstances, that could have totally blown

142
00:09:06,787 --> 00:09:10,089
up in a bad way.

143
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,731
It worked out OK for me.

144
00:09:14,207 --> 00:09:16,709
you know, don't, this kind of stuff feels real good,

145
00:09:18,111 --> 00:09:22,235
but that impulse is, you have to be very careful about.

146
00:09:22,255 --> 00:09:25,899
The one time I think I did handle it much better

147
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:29,303
was following our early access launch.

148
00:09:30,944 --> 00:09:32,906
I was getting hassled by a customer,

149
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:34,848
not even a customer, a person who was,

150
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:37,351
uh... suggesting that are

151
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:40,894
you know i i i i informing me politely that our price should be down

152
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:42,996
uh... fifteen dollars and it was

153
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:47,120
uh... was one thing to like to get a cup everyone gets comments and stuff

154
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,002
but when becomes like a daily

155
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:50,783
uh... repeat and like

156
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:53,486
genuinely confused like why didn't you listen to my advice

157
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:54,226
uh...

158
00:09:55,087 --> 00:10:01,272
That was when I responded with the whole Price Post with the Nickelback poster thing.

159
00:10:02,633 --> 00:10:07,177
But that was actually the second draft of the post that I had written.

160
00:10:08,538 --> 00:10:11,821
The first response that I had written was a lot more inflammatory.

161
00:10:13,842 --> 00:10:15,203
It was a lot more obscenities.

162
00:10:15,303 --> 00:10:19,507
And if I had posted that, the response would have been something a little bit more like

163
00:10:19,567 --> 00:10:19,827
this.

164
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:29,732
And I know people say that like any press is good press, but I think there's a line there.

165
00:10:34,415 --> 00:10:39,397
So a final point is that this sort of relation of time to distance to understanding.

166
00:10:39,658 --> 00:10:43,740
So one of the...

167
00:10:46,556 --> 00:10:54,443
It wasn't until basically six months after our 1.0 launch in summer 2016 that I actually

168
00:10:55,304 --> 00:11:03,531
calmed down and got enough perspective on what had happened to actually start doing

169
00:11:03,592 --> 00:11:07,055
something about it, to start addressing it properly, both from a...

170
00:11:07,955 --> 00:11:10,237
dev side and also from a personal side.

171
00:11:11,058 --> 00:11:12,239
There's the classic phrase,

172
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,640
seeing the forest for the trees.

173
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,843
This idea that when you're in the middle of development,

174
00:11:17,883 --> 00:11:18,883
you're right in the thick of it,

175
00:11:19,404 --> 00:11:22,346
and you need to be able to back away a little bit

176
00:11:22,506 --> 00:11:23,927
and see the whole picture.

177
00:11:23,947 --> 00:11:26,189
And the only way that you can get that distance

178
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:26,769
is with time.

179
00:11:29,171 --> 00:11:30,932
And then that last little bit is that

180
00:11:31,673 --> 00:11:35,375
you have to get some understanding of your situation

181
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:36,516
in order to be able to assess it.

182
00:11:37,722 --> 00:11:40,443
And once you have that opportunity to assess where you

183
00:11:40,643 --> 00:11:44,645
are, whatever has happened, either game dev or personal

184
00:11:44,665 --> 00:11:48,867
experiences, whatever that event in your life is, you can

185
00:11:48,907 --> 00:11:53,469
then, the decision ultimately boils down to do you salvage

186
00:11:53,869 --> 00:11:56,931
whatever, like spend more time and energy to salvage whatever

187
00:11:57,231 --> 00:12:00,092
thing you're in, or do you step away and move on?

188
00:12:00,993 --> 00:12:01,193
And so.

189
00:12:03,398 --> 00:12:08,023
you know, happy ending. In our particular case with Brigador, I realized that a lot

190
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:14,468
of those mistakes were relatively small things that I could correct. And so we dedicated

191
00:12:14,489 --> 00:12:19,153
another six months to actually fixing the game. We relaunched it and have since actually

192
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:24,698
made it to be a properly earning title. So that worked out okay. And the...

193
00:12:25,615 --> 00:12:29,361
There's a nice little quote from the director, Christopher Nolan, which is, he just talks

194
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:35,209
about how persistence is 90% of the battle.

195
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,413
And then he goes on to say, well, it's actually 70%, but 90% sounds much better.

196
00:12:43,938 --> 00:12:58,247
Something I had hoped to do with this talk and with other times that I've spoken either online or in person is just that we, everyone wants to cultivate a culture of success and an aura of success around them.

197
00:12:58,267 --> 00:13:00,488
It's the whole Facebook syndrome, right?

198
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:03,870
No one wants to appear like they're having trouble.

199
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:09,173
And I think that's a natural impulse, but at the same time, that can be unhealthy for the community as a whole.

200
00:13:10,254 --> 00:13:11,454
And I know for me personally.

201
00:13:13,195 --> 00:13:18,059
It wasn't until I started reading about how other developers,

202
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:20,020
both in the games industry, but also in film,

203
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,722
like, you know, other people who have started these big projects,

204
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:30,186
had profound issues, either failures or, you know, struggles and things,

205
00:13:30,747 --> 00:13:33,889
and was able to start relating those to my own experience

206
00:13:33,949 --> 00:13:38,191
that I then was able to sort of pick up and move on.

207
00:13:40,273 --> 00:13:40,993
But at the end of the day...

208
00:13:41,764 --> 00:13:44,586
it just comes down to this guy.

209
00:14:10,492 --> 00:14:12,513
I'm sure you'll be able to achieve your goal!

210
00:14:12,533 --> 00:14:12,953
That's why I say,

211
00:14:13,073 --> 00:14:13,453
NEVER GIVE UP!

212
00:14:38,243 --> 00:14:39,524
Hello. Oh, he's...

213
00:14:40,445 --> 00:14:40,525
Hi.

214
00:14:40,605 --> 00:14:40,845
Yes.

215
00:14:41,765 --> 00:14:43,106
Thanks very much, Hugh. That was really good.

216
00:14:43,546 --> 00:14:48,929
Do you think that, for yourself, part of the issue is that, because of social now,

217
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:54,671
a lot of what we do is accessible to all, so you're watched constantly?

218
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:57,293
And did that have an effect as you were working on your game?

219
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:06,093
Uh, I mean, yeah, it's the, definitely being, well, I mean, that's a decision you have to

220
00:15:06,133 --> 00:15:12,536
make, right? So we, uh, for a significant portion of development, um, uh, so I live

221
00:15:12,576 --> 00:15:19,618
in Champaign, Illinois. Um, Volition is there, but no one else. Uh, and when we were just

222
00:15:19,638 --> 00:15:24,320
starting out, I was too afraid to talk to anyone at Volition. So we functionally operated

223
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,401
in like complete isolation for about three years.

224
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:34,042
And it wasn't until we started having something to show that I started actually branching

225
00:15:34,102 --> 00:15:34,862
out into social media.

226
00:15:35,523 --> 00:15:37,404
Probably started doing that a few years too late.

227
00:15:39,525 --> 00:15:46,189
But okay, so to actually address your question, yes, I think having a presence on social media

228
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:51,172
and having that observed effect or being observed has a huge effect on development.

229
00:15:52,692 --> 00:15:54,494
But it also has to do with...

230
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,602
I think your ability to temper that as a developer.

231
00:16:00,202 --> 00:16:05,925
So if you are someone for whom having the opinions of others,

232
00:16:05,945 --> 00:16:08,426
like if that's an important thing to you,

233
00:16:09,987 --> 00:16:11,708
and especially I think with smaller teams,

234
00:16:11,748 --> 00:16:14,729
you feel that more intensely, that

235
00:16:14,749 --> 00:16:17,711
can be a great impact if you're getting positive response.

236
00:16:18,131 --> 00:16:20,172
But on the negative side of that.

237
00:16:21,367 --> 00:16:25,128
So I guess there's still the option of sealing yourself off

238
00:16:25,168 --> 00:16:30,989
and I think there are cases of giving a project

239
00:16:31,069 --> 00:16:34,450
kind of time in the incubator until you're ready to show.

240
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,231
But then that is an active decision of,

241
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:38,692
because there's a lot of good and bad

242
00:16:38,712 --> 00:16:39,452
that can come with that.

243
00:16:40,472 --> 00:16:41,832
Anyway, sorry, I hope that addressed your question.

244
00:16:41,912 --> 00:16:42,573
Cheers.

245
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,553
Thank you for your patience, everyone.

246
00:16:44,573 --> 00:16:45,874
Hi.

247
00:16:46,074 --> 00:16:49,114
Yeah, you, good answer.

248
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:49,555
Yes.

249
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,743
All right, so I'm going to talk about the Moonhunters mistake.

250
00:16:55,844 --> 00:16:58,106
You might know me as the captain of Kit Fox Games.

251
00:16:58,547 --> 00:17:00,749
Moonhunters was our biggest project, probably,

252
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:01,790
in press so far.

253
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,992
We also released A Shrouded Isle last year.

254
00:17:04,653 --> 00:17:07,155
And we just announced Boyfriend Dungeon.

255
00:17:07,175 --> 00:17:07,235
Woo!

256
00:17:08,857 --> 00:17:10,739
And I'm co-editing textbooks on the side.

257
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,482
But it seems like most indies that get press and attention,

258
00:17:15,163 --> 00:17:20,367
appear to err on the side of waiting too long to release their games, extending their launch

259
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:24,711
date again and again for years and years, and if that's right for you, that's fine,

260
00:17:24,751 --> 00:17:26,032
and we're all different people.

261
00:17:26,773 --> 00:17:27,874
Some people have that flaw.

262
00:17:28,054 --> 00:17:34,300
My flaw is the other side of the coin, and I know that I need to worry about not launching

263
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,682
too early, because that's what we did.

264
00:17:37,862 --> 00:17:41,023
Luckily, now I know the warning signs that I'm ready to share with you.

265
00:17:42,324 --> 00:17:45,005
And this was 100% my call to make.

266
00:17:45,305 --> 00:17:50,546
I want to emphasize that my team was incredible and they gave me all the power to make this

267
00:17:50,586 --> 00:17:52,147
decision and I made it badly.

268
00:17:52,587 --> 00:17:54,347
So here I am.

269
00:17:54,427 --> 00:17:55,248
I called it wrong.

270
00:17:56,328 --> 00:18:00,511
Back in early 2016, we were getting ready to launch our biggest game.

271
00:18:01,432 --> 00:18:03,293
Moon Hunters was very exciting for us.

272
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,135
We'd been working on it for only a little over two years.

273
00:18:06,455 --> 00:18:07,976
So it was ripe and ready.

274
00:18:08,576 --> 00:18:13,440
And we'd done a lot of promotion throughout the years in Montreal, at events, at PAX,

275
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,102
and online with weekly live streams.

276
00:18:16,842 --> 00:18:20,104
We basically felt like we were living in this giant hot spotlight.

277
00:18:20,905 --> 00:18:23,066
And we had had a successful Kickstarter.

278
00:18:23,927 --> 00:18:26,169
$178,000 isn't like breaking any records,

279
00:18:26,249 --> 00:18:29,632
but for a first major game and a new IP from a new studio,

280
00:18:29,652 --> 00:18:33,736
I mean, 400% and 6,000 backers was very exciting

281
00:18:33,756 --> 00:18:34,737
and something to be proud of.

282
00:18:35,397 --> 00:18:37,579
And I mean, we didn't even have a mid-campaign slump.

283
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,182
It seemed like it had its own word of mouth power.

284
00:18:41,262 --> 00:18:44,065
It would somehow organically grow out there on the internet.

285
00:18:44,725 --> 00:18:46,947
And in the years following, I gave lots of talks

286
00:18:47,007 --> 00:18:49,049
about how to run a successful Kickstarter.

287
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:54,614
Haha, and I mean all this coverage and word-of-mouth

288
00:18:55,054 --> 00:19:00,619
It seemed like it was paying off. We got into showcases. We won awards. We were on the covers of magazines

289
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:03,862
I mean we were bombarded with publishing offers, which we discarded

290
00:19:03,882 --> 00:19:07,705
And so I mean we we got a little bit cocky

291
00:19:07,725 --> 00:19:11,828
It was reasonable to think that it was a good sign of sales to come

292
00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:16,692
Everyone that I talked to told me we had a hit on our hands

293
00:19:17,753 --> 00:19:24,059
We actually launched with months of cash in the bank and a contract that was ready to sign.

294
00:19:24,259 --> 00:19:28,443
We had no financial pressure to launch at all and yet we still launched early.

295
00:19:29,204 --> 00:19:35,409
In fact, we had so much visibility and so much good fortune that our launch moment was filmed by a crew from PBS

296
00:19:35,589 --> 00:19:39,193
for a TV series on tech and culture, which we'll come back in a moment.

297
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:45,296
The launch was bad, I don't know if you've gotten that from what I've said so far, but

298
00:19:45,577 --> 00:19:46,878
we disappointed our fans.

299
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:53,142
You can't please everyone, of course, but we did have to admit to ourselves that we'd

300
00:19:53,182 --> 00:19:58,426
launched with a lot of bugs and maybe, well, definitely worse, a few core systems that

301
00:19:58,446 --> 00:20:00,207
we felt needed serious changes.

302
00:20:01,423 --> 00:20:03,845
So we ended up with a mixed Steam review user rating

303
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,549
in the half, like on and off in the launch month,

304
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,672
which kind of tanked our whole visibility.

305
00:20:10,452 --> 00:20:11,934
Metacritic was not much better.

306
00:20:11,954 --> 00:20:14,457
And I think, honestly, the hardest thing

307
00:20:14,657 --> 00:20:17,600
was seeing other devs, especially acquaintances,

308
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,482
kind of treat me a little bit differently

309
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:22,165
than they had back when they thought that I had a hit.

310
00:20:22,585 --> 00:20:24,267
And now that I didn't, it was different.

311
00:20:26,032 --> 00:20:31,076
And to make matters worse, mainstream audiences were already set up to doubt the game's integrity.

312
00:20:31,256 --> 00:20:34,738
I mean, of course, some of these people would never have bought the game, they weren't our audience,

313
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:41,163
but it still kind of, like, was not fun to know that our technical problems would prove the indie skeptics right

314
00:20:41,604 --> 00:20:45,287
in calling us low-rent garbage. Like, that's not a good feeling either.

315
00:20:46,209 --> 00:20:48,390
And there were measurable consequences to this problem.

316
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:51,230
This mistake cost us a lot.

317
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,611
This is how you tell it's a healthy launch week, by the way.

318
00:20:54,011 --> 00:20:55,271
Our next launch went much better

319
00:20:55,331 --> 00:20:57,251
in terms of how the launch week went.

320
00:20:57,551 --> 00:20:59,952
So you can see, even if that peak is not as high,

321
00:21:00,372 --> 00:21:02,493
the fact that it's fatter throughout the days,

322
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:04,293
this is just the first three days of the launch week,

323
00:21:05,073 --> 00:21:06,173
it means people who are buying it

324
00:21:06,213 --> 00:21:07,154
are telling their friends.

325
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:09,594
That's a good launch week looking.

326
00:21:09,954 --> 00:21:16,843
as unlike Moon Hunters, which launched and the hype train hit this big wall.

327
00:21:18,084 --> 00:21:22,309
So you can see which one is going to have a better next four days, for example.

328
00:21:24,003 --> 00:21:25,603
I mean, launch days don't determine everything

329
00:21:25,643 --> 00:21:27,544
about your revenue, but it did determine

330
00:21:27,564 --> 00:21:29,724
a lot of the coverage and apparent success

331
00:21:29,924 --> 00:21:32,045
of the game for the next six months to a year.

332
00:21:32,645 --> 00:21:34,125
I can't help but think if that we'd waited

333
00:21:34,185 --> 00:21:36,786
to launch the game until it was actually ready,

334
00:21:37,266 --> 00:21:38,866
then our Metacritic and user reviews

335
00:21:38,886 --> 00:21:40,246
might have been much higher, and all of that

336
00:21:40,286 --> 00:21:42,527
would have led to even higher spikes down the road,

337
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:44,307
which would have amounted to an additional

338
00:21:44,407 --> 00:21:46,228
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

339
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:49,667
This is what PBS had to say.

340
00:21:50,447 --> 00:21:52,568
Sales weren't great, thanks PBS,

341
00:21:53,168 --> 00:21:55,129
but that's what happens when you release a game

342
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:55,789
that isn't ready.

343
00:21:56,689 --> 00:21:58,630
And despite our launch day being better

344
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,491
than a lot of indies, I'm very grateful

345
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:02,632
for what luck we did have.

346
00:22:03,332 --> 00:22:04,873
We could tell that this coming year,

347
00:22:05,413 --> 00:22:07,834
we might not have enough money to stay in the studio

348
00:22:07,954 --> 00:22:09,515
at the size and the comfort level

349
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:10,595
that we were getting used to.

350
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:15,854
And even aside from the money, I prepared myself emotionally for bad sales.

351
00:22:16,254 --> 00:22:19,337
That's why I had signed this other contract beforehand.

352
00:22:19,457 --> 00:22:24,662
But I hadn't really considered seriously that we might disappoint people and make what

353
00:22:24,722 --> 00:22:26,424
could be called a bad game.

354
00:22:27,425 --> 00:22:28,245
We were heartbroken.

355
00:22:28,366 --> 00:22:32,209
It felt like we'd wasted years of our lives making something that wasn't really worth

356
00:22:32,329 --> 00:22:33,370
all that time and energy.

357
00:22:33,771 --> 00:22:36,814
It made me feel like I'd peaked and that I was old and tired.

358
00:22:37,928 --> 00:22:39,668
And in hindsight, we totally should have known better.

359
00:22:39,989 --> 00:22:42,449
One YouTuber went so far as to write me a heartfelt letter

360
00:22:42,509 --> 00:22:45,530
during the beta, pleading with me to delay the launch.

361
00:22:46,171 --> 00:22:48,871
But I ignored that and all the other warning signs

362
00:22:49,272 --> 00:22:50,772
because hindsight's so great.

363
00:22:52,093 --> 00:22:53,353
So why did we launch too early?

364
00:22:53,453 --> 00:22:55,294
If we set aside the hindsight bias

365
00:22:55,754 --> 00:22:56,934
and think about the moment,

366
00:22:57,474 --> 00:23:00,215
I'm gonna lay bare all of my personal flaws for you

367
00:23:00,235 --> 00:23:03,356
so that you can see if any of this sounds familiar,

368
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,937
you might have a similar problem.

369
00:23:07,932 --> 00:23:11,953
Indies often go around saying you should double or triple all your estimates and then double

370
00:23:11,993 --> 00:23:16,494
them again and it makes me want to scream because production is actually a skill and

371
00:23:16,514 --> 00:23:17,575
it's worth practicing.

372
00:23:19,215 --> 00:23:22,997
And so I get a little bit defiant when people start telling me you're going to keep delaying

373
00:23:23,017 --> 00:23:23,377
your game.

374
00:23:23,717 --> 00:23:25,177
Ha ha ha, your launch date isn't real.

375
00:23:25,817 --> 00:23:27,978
In fact I got really like, fuck you, defiant.

376
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:34,121
And it is totally possible to release your game on schedule, I promise.

377
00:23:34,861 --> 00:23:39,103
But don't give up everything and obsess on that, maybe?

378
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:44,571
And so it came to pass that each delay that we added to the game,

379
00:23:44,671 --> 00:23:48,255
even like a week of delay, felt like a personal attack on me

380
00:23:48,896 --> 00:23:50,158
and my production skill.

381
00:23:50,758 --> 00:23:52,941
And I started feeling kind of fraudulent.

382
00:23:53,121 --> 00:23:56,545
And so I irrationally had decided we couldn't delay again.

383
00:23:56,585 --> 00:23:57,366
We just couldn't.

384
00:23:57,507 --> 00:24:00,490
It was a law of the universe now, which was incorrect.

385
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:04,296
And the team morale was getting a little bit low,

386
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:06,678
and I'm a cheerleader type personality,

387
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:09,742
so we weren't crunching particularly.

388
00:24:09,822 --> 00:24:10,844
We were working pretty hard,

389
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:13,247
and finishing projects is exhausting.

390
00:24:13,847 --> 00:24:15,429
Even if you only work 40 hours a week,

391
00:24:15,469 --> 00:24:17,772
you're multitasking, you're prioritizing, you're.

392
00:24:18,032 --> 00:24:23,537
you're compromising and just finishing a game is really difficult. So I was looking at the

393
00:24:23,557 --> 00:24:27,441
team and we'd already delayed by a few weeks and I thought well um you know I want I want

394
00:24:27,461 --> 00:24:33,005
them to be happy again let's release the game. Um but releasing a bad game does not make

395
00:24:33,065 --> 00:24:34,907
anyone happy it turns out.

396
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:41,974
And I also worried about launching next to a couple of other indie games and during other

397
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:44,157
game events like GDC and PAX and things.

398
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:48,842
And in the greater scheme of things, I think there are actually much bigger things to worry

399
00:24:48,882 --> 00:24:49,062
about.

400
00:24:49,102 --> 00:24:53,507
The quality of your game is much more important than probably any other indie game, to be

401
00:24:53,547 --> 00:24:54,228
completely honest.

402
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:57,800
And this might be very Moonhunter specific,

403
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,302
but due to various factors,

404
00:25:00,342 --> 00:25:02,263
we undervalued the online multiplayer

405
00:25:02,383 --> 00:25:04,084
and we launched with it in a beta mode,

406
00:25:04,144 --> 00:25:04,964
which we thought was fine.

407
00:25:04,984 --> 00:25:05,965
We marked it beta.

408
00:25:07,046 --> 00:25:09,387
Still, most of the down thumbs

409
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:11,688
were bad online multiplayer related

410
00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:13,789
and they would never revise those

411
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:15,290
no matter how we pleaded with them

412
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:16,691
after we fixed the bugs.

413
00:25:17,972 --> 00:25:19,273
And yeah, we thought it would be okay

414
00:25:19,313 --> 00:25:20,653
if the online multiplayer took a little while.

415
00:25:21,154 --> 00:25:21,814
That was incorrect.

416
00:25:24,267 --> 00:25:26,908
And as I mentioned, we had lined up this contract

417
00:25:26,928 --> 00:25:28,770
that was starting very soon afterwards,

418
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,931
and I'd already delayed that by a few weeks,

419
00:25:30,991 --> 00:25:33,753
and so I let this external factor kind of influence me

420
00:25:34,393 --> 00:25:37,455
and make me think that we absolutely had

421
00:25:37,895 --> 00:25:40,637
to stop working on the game.

422
00:25:41,017 --> 00:25:42,258
And it's true that at that point,

423
00:25:42,298 --> 00:25:43,979
because I had scheduled this contract to start,

424
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:47,661
if I had delayed again, it was theoretically possible that.

425
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:52,946
the game would then sell zero copies and that contract would be null and void and then Kitfox

426
00:25:52,986 --> 00:25:53,547
would close.

427
00:25:54,209 --> 00:26:00,640
So it felt like the right thing at the time to prioritize this other external factor.

428
00:26:01,796 --> 00:26:02,997
And we did eventually do okay.

429
00:26:03,457 --> 00:26:04,198
Kid Fox survived.

430
00:26:04,598 --> 00:26:07,020
Moon Hunters actually did pretty well over time.

431
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,601
Some of it is my personal excellent luck.

432
00:26:09,841 --> 00:26:10,742
I'm a very lucky person,

433
00:26:11,222 --> 00:26:12,423
and I try to stay grateful for that,

434
00:26:12,623 --> 00:26:14,605
but we also did work really hard at it.

435
00:26:15,085 --> 00:26:17,527
We spent a lot of time fixing bugs

436
00:26:17,567 --> 00:26:19,528
and apologizing and answering emails.

437
00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:24,291
We also spent about six months making a free DLC afterwards

438
00:26:24,651 --> 00:26:25,592
called Eternal Echoes.

439
00:26:25,832 --> 00:26:28,034
And that did the core systems revising

440
00:26:28,094 --> 00:26:28,914
that I mentioned before.

441
00:26:29,895 --> 00:26:31,736
And so that gave us kind of another attempt

442
00:26:31,936 --> 00:26:32,957
at attracting press.

443
00:26:33,517 --> 00:26:35,418
And it gave us more of a peace of mind

444
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:37,560
as well to leave the game in a better state

445
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,380
that we were proud of.

446
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:41,102
So even if it hadn't resulted in a sales boost,

447
00:26:41,162 --> 00:26:42,683
we still would have been glad that we did it.

448
00:26:43,944 --> 00:26:46,286
And also, making this would have been so much faster

449
00:26:46,346 --> 00:26:46,946
before launch.

450
00:26:47,787 --> 00:26:49,268
If you have something you want to add to the game

451
00:26:49,668 --> 00:26:51,290
and you can afford to delay it,

452
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,791
just put it in the game first

453
00:26:52,871 --> 00:26:55,533
because LiveOps is horrendously distracting.

454
00:26:56,814 --> 00:26:59,015
And the reviews did trend mostly upwards afterwards.

455
00:26:59,216 --> 00:27:00,637
After we made all those improvements,

456
00:27:01,057 --> 00:27:03,379
I think we actually were able to harvest the goodwill

457
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:05,380
that we'd built up from the Kickstarter updates

458
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,361
that we were constantly making.

459
00:27:06,381 --> 00:27:08,383
And maybe our community is more forgiving

460
00:27:08,403 --> 00:27:09,463
than the average Steam player.

461
00:27:10,024 --> 00:27:10,704
I guess we'll never know.

462
00:27:12,084 --> 00:27:16,467
One thing that I do want to emphasize is the importance of our launch party, actually.

463
00:27:16,967 --> 00:27:21,590
My team and I definitely felt like we received first aid from the Montreal community itself

464
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,191
by hosting our launch party three days later.

465
00:27:24,211 --> 00:27:29,835
There's nothing that can replace the feeling of people who genuinely are happy for you

466
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:33,056
and being proud of you and excited for you.

467
00:27:33,657 --> 00:27:36,998
Everyone on the team kind of wanted to cancel the launch party.

468
00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:40,700
But we did it anyway, and we were all really,

469
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,101
everybody on the team was also grateful that we did afterwards.

470
00:27:43,501 --> 00:27:45,822
There were sad tears and then happy tears.

471
00:27:46,823 --> 00:27:49,224
So if you're thinking about cancelling your launch party

472
00:27:49,324 --> 00:27:52,105
or making it hinge on the success of the game, do not do that.

473
00:27:52,685 --> 00:27:55,026
Even if you have to make it BYOB, that's okay.

474
00:27:55,467 --> 00:27:59,248
But take your moment to celebrate that you did something.

475
00:28:00,842 --> 00:28:03,524
And personally, I was actually healed by coming to GDC

476
00:28:03,564 --> 00:28:04,686
the week after launching.

477
00:28:05,106 --> 00:28:06,708
I thought it would be massively humiliating,

478
00:28:07,528 --> 00:28:09,070
and instead it was comforting.

479
00:28:09,871 --> 00:28:11,332
Even though a few professional acquaintances

480
00:28:11,372 --> 00:28:12,573
did treat me a little bit differently,

481
00:28:13,414 --> 00:28:15,737
I did actually find out who my friends were

482
00:28:15,817 --> 00:28:19,300
among the community who could share with me

483
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,042
their experiences from around the world.

484
00:28:22,343 --> 00:28:24,544
Because whenever I told someone about my disappointment,

485
00:28:24,984 --> 00:28:28,105
more experienced indies would lean in and nod sagely

486
00:28:28,205 --> 00:28:30,946
and tell me a horror story that was way worse,

487
00:28:31,986 --> 00:28:33,447
which I'd never heard of.

488
00:28:33,467 --> 00:28:36,488
Like, we only talk about success.

489
00:28:36,508 --> 00:28:37,968
I mean, all I say in public is,

490
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:39,609
Moon Hunter is totally successful.

491
00:28:39,729 --> 00:28:40,929
Yeah, it was great.

492
00:28:41,829 --> 00:28:43,410
But for those of you who are in the audience right now,

493
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:46,551
please understand that games go off the tracks all the time.

494
00:28:47,091 --> 00:28:49,232
It's okay, you're not uniquely humiliated.

495
00:28:50,692 --> 00:28:51,933
It's kind of part of it.

496
00:28:52,794 --> 00:28:54,555
So that's part of why I volunteered to be here today,

497
00:28:54,615 --> 00:28:57,177
because I not only want to combat survivorship bias,

498
00:28:57,237 --> 00:28:59,259
but generally improve our culture

499
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,561
and help us understand that failure

500
00:29:01,641 --> 00:29:02,681
is part of craftsmanship.

501
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:06,065
And all that visibility that we'd created before

502
00:29:06,105 --> 00:29:07,086
didn't vaporize.

503
00:29:07,727 --> 00:29:09,147
I was able to do some hustling

504
00:29:09,488 --> 00:29:11,109
and get an indie box in the works.

505
00:29:11,169 --> 00:29:12,430
And thank you, Jamie Tucker,

506
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:15,372
for including us in your cool Steam cross-promo.

507
00:29:15,432 --> 00:29:16,192
That was great.

508
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:18,554
And then after we ported the game

509
00:29:18,614 --> 00:29:19,955
to all three major consoles,

510
00:29:20,715 --> 00:29:22,456
here's us porting it to PS4

511
00:29:22,497 --> 00:29:25,418
when the actual porting programmers in Japan at the time,

512
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:26,659
which was a little bit funny.

513
00:29:28,741 --> 00:29:32,082
Oh, I wanted to mention that the Halo effect is totally real.

514
00:29:32,422 --> 00:29:33,543
At least it was for Moon Hunters.

515
00:29:33,603 --> 00:29:35,624
That every time we would release on a new platform,

516
00:29:35,724 --> 00:29:37,045
our Steam sales would get a boost.

517
00:29:37,925 --> 00:29:40,726
And I think that if we had simultaneously launched

518
00:29:40,906 --> 00:29:42,547
all of the games on all the platforms,

519
00:29:42,587 --> 00:29:44,048
which is the conventional wisdom,

520
00:29:44,068 --> 00:29:45,709
well, we couldn't have done that physically anyway.

521
00:29:45,749 --> 00:29:46,409
We were incapable.

522
00:29:46,469 --> 00:29:49,330
But even if we had, I think the Halo effect

523
00:29:49,351 --> 00:29:50,691
would have been kind of negated by the fact

524
00:29:50,711 --> 00:29:52,032
that our Steam score was so low.

525
00:29:52,532 --> 00:29:54,333
So it was really good that we were able to

526
00:29:54,433 --> 00:29:56,694
put the best version on the platform after we had...

527
00:29:57,121 --> 00:29:58,242
kind of salvaged that.

528
00:29:59,763 --> 00:30:01,365
And most importantly to the future of the studio,

529
00:30:01,565 --> 00:30:03,287
we've incorporated all of these lessons

530
00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:04,888
into our workflows going forward.

531
00:30:04,908 --> 00:30:06,870
So our production evaluations for milestones

532
00:30:07,351 --> 00:30:09,353
are now less about specific dates

533
00:30:09,613 --> 00:30:12,756
and much more about what the deliveries themselves are

534
00:30:12,796 --> 00:30:14,077
and whether they are up to par.

535
00:30:14,577 --> 00:30:17,680
So we're more willing to add some time to the schedule

536
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:21,984
as assuming that everything is up to quality.

537
00:30:22,744 --> 00:30:25,426
And survival of the studio is definitely number one still in my mind.

538
00:30:26,027 --> 00:30:27,448
Kit Fox is not allowed to close.

539
00:30:27,929 --> 00:30:30,511
But in the past we failed to prioritize beyond that.

540
00:30:30,611 --> 00:30:34,035
So my own personal production neuroses would come through.

541
00:30:34,055 --> 00:30:36,978
And kind of efficiency became more important than quality.

542
00:30:37,939 --> 00:30:41,122
And that was by accident because we didn't really examine it.

543
00:30:41,242 --> 00:30:44,325
So now we're very clearly, officially...

544
00:30:44,845 --> 00:30:46,686
Quality is more important than efficiency,

545
00:30:47,306 --> 00:30:49,126
so assuming that you're not gonna close the studio

546
00:30:49,186 --> 00:30:51,847
with your little flares here and there,

547
00:30:51,927 --> 00:30:54,747
then take your time and make it the best you can.

548
00:30:55,467 --> 00:30:57,968
Because it's true what they say, you do only launch once.

549
00:30:58,668 --> 00:31:00,468
Delaying your game isn't nearly as bad

550
00:31:00,728 --> 00:31:02,269
as launching a bad game.

551
00:31:03,869 --> 00:31:06,749
Reality is probably more important than your pride.

552
00:31:07,349 --> 00:31:08,730
Your team's morale will be better

553
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:10,010
when they believe in the game

554
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,730
and feel good about what they've made.

555
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:14,132
So if you're like me and you're prone to rushing ahead

556
00:31:14,152 --> 00:31:15,313
and you're an impatient person,

557
00:31:15,973 --> 00:31:17,914
just take a breath, recheck your calculations,

558
00:31:17,974 --> 00:31:20,937
bring in fresh eyes, double check all of your assumptions.

559
00:31:21,557 --> 00:31:22,958
We're applying all of this to development

560
00:31:22,998 --> 00:31:24,619
of Boyfriend Dungeon, which is our next game,

561
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:25,680
so wish us luck with that.

562
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:29,583
We actually have a milestone next week, so we'll see.

563
00:31:29,743 --> 00:31:31,324
And hopefully we're learning from our mistakes

564
00:31:31,624 --> 00:31:33,165
and making better and better games.

565
00:31:33,646 --> 00:31:33,926
Thank you.

566
00:31:43,521 --> 00:31:47,724
So yeah, we have plenty of time for questions for either speaker.

567
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:51,207
And just make sure to go to one of the microphones, please.

568
00:31:51,828 --> 00:31:53,209
Let's start the interrogation.

569
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,871
And don't forget to do your evaluations.

570
00:31:58,914 --> 00:32:00,555
Seriously, though, any questions are cool.

571
00:32:02,076 --> 00:32:04,598
Actual questions, not I have a comment, maybe?

572
00:32:05,989 --> 00:32:06,249
Hello.

573
00:32:06,269 --> 00:32:06,809
Hi.

574
00:32:06,829 --> 00:32:07,410
How's it going?

575
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:08,570
It's excellent.

576
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,531
This question's for you primarily.

577
00:32:11,872 --> 00:32:12,932
I've had the experience where I've

578
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:15,253
had friends who have metaphorically grabbed me

579
00:32:15,273 --> 00:32:17,094
by the shoulders and shaken me and saying,

580
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:18,635
you need to finish.

581
00:32:18,715 --> 00:32:20,255
Finishing is super important.

582
00:32:20,775 --> 00:32:22,896
And don't just stay in development forever

583
00:32:23,417 --> 00:32:27,338
and almost yell at me to move forward.

584
00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:29,979
Outside of actual financial pressure,

585
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:32,100
you're going to close if you don't start releasing something.

586
00:32:33,241 --> 00:32:34,641
How would you respond to that?

587
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,880
I would say I am probably unusual.

588
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:43,021
It does seem to me that I am an outlier and that most people err on the other side.

589
00:32:43,642 --> 00:32:48,643
Like I said at the beginning, I think most indies tend towards just working in a cave

590
00:32:48,703 --> 00:32:53,964
forever on their perfect dream, whereas I am much more of a flurry of like, let's just

591
00:32:54,164 --> 00:32:54,544
do it.

592
00:32:55,644 --> 00:33:00,806
And so you have to look inside yourself to see what is your nature and how do you prevent

593
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:04,907
that from calcifying because on both ends of the spectrum there are problems.

594
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:08,169
And I guess my, I feel like my side of the spectrum

595
00:33:08,189 --> 00:33:09,650
isn't talked about as much.

596
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:12,532
It's just seen as obvious, whereas sitting in a room

597
00:33:12,572 --> 00:33:14,053
and working on it for way too long

598
00:33:14,173 --> 00:33:15,094
is less obvious somehow.

599
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:20,778
But yeah, I can't answer for you in particular.

600
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:22,760
Only you can know your heart.

601
00:33:24,521 --> 00:33:28,084
But I would say that finishing is important.

602
00:33:28,304 --> 00:33:30,285
Maybe look up production practices.

603
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:33,008
I think if we all started being more hygienic

604
00:33:33,108 --> 00:33:34,929
about how we estimate our tasks.

605
00:33:35,369 --> 00:33:37,731
and think about how long things actually take us

606
00:33:37,871 --> 00:33:40,194
and calculate that and check our assumptions

607
00:33:40,494 --> 00:33:42,997
on our timelines, then we'll all be happier.

608
00:33:44,258 --> 00:33:45,159
If I could chip in on that.

609
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:48,660
The, one of the biggest changes that we've seen in the industry

610
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:53,202
in the last 20 years is the fact that I think the vast majority

611
00:33:53,222 --> 00:33:54,922
of us in this room when we're shipping a game,

612
00:33:54,962 --> 00:33:56,383
we're shipping purely digitally, right?

613
00:33:57,983 --> 00:33:59,504
And that, the environment

614
00:33:59,544 --> 00:34:01,864
for shipping a game has totally changed, right?

615
00:34:01,984 --> 00:34:06,066
So you've got options for early access, you can just get

616
00:34:06,106 --> 00:34:07,066
on Steam for 100 bucks now.

617
00:34:08,066 --> 00:34:13,368
You can also do various forms of closed beta or closed alpha,

618
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,588
look at spy party.

619
00:34:15,163 --> 00:34:20,525
look at Saltzman's Overland, what was the...

620
00:34:20,685 --> 00:34:22,965
Venge's current game, Overland.

621
00:34:23,806 --> 00:34:26,707
There's a lot of different ways that you can basically

622
00:34:26,887 --> 00:34:29,428
get the kind of feedback you need from a player base

623
00:34:30,928 --> 00:34:33,689
and keep it to only the diehards to figure out

624
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:35,049
are we ready to ship or not?

625
00:34:35,169 --> 00:34:36,470
Because if you've got a bunch of people,

626
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,571
the people who would love you screaming.

627
00:34:40,071 --> 00:34:41,452
then it's like, okay, maybe we should delay it.

628
00:34:41,492 --> 00:34:42,833
But otherwise, if everyone's like, thumbs up,

629
00:34:42,853 --> 00:34:46,476
then yeah, you can get a degree of external evaluation

630
00:34:46,556 --> 00:34:49,739
from people who don't have an influence on that.

631
00:34:50,299 --> 00:34:51,700
One thing I would mention is actually,

632
00:34:52,301 --> 00:34:54,963
there are part-time producers that you can hire out there.

633
00:34:55,063 --> 00:34:56,424
Felix Kramer's incredible.

634
00:34:56,804 --> 00:34:58,605
There's a bunch of part-time producers

635
00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:00,026
that you should totally think about

636
00:35:00,067 --> 00:35:01,428
throwing a couple hundred dollars on

637
00:35:01,468 --> 00:35:04,790
because it's probably worth it to get a real professional

638
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:07,232
to look at your timeline and look at your game

639
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:09,033
and give you an expert.

640
00:35:09,568 --> 00:35:11,608
assessment of whether or not you're ready to ship.

641
00:35:12,509 --> 00:35:12,929
Thank you both.

642
00:35:13,369 --> 00:35:13,529
Cheers.

643
00:35:13,549 --> 00:35:13,849
You're welcome.

644
00:35:15,689 --> 00:35:16,510
Hi, my name is Blake.

645
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:17,730
Hi, Blake.

646
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:18,230
Thank you.

647
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:19,810
My question is for Hugh.

648
00:35:21,311 --> 00:35:24,492
You said you relaunched like six months after your first launch?

649
00:35:24,812 --> 00:35:25,072
A year.

650
00:35:25,172 --> 00:35:28,292
So, our first launch, so early access was October 2015.

651
00:35:28,352 --> 00:35:28,753
1.0 was June 2016, up armored.

652
00:35:28,813 --> 00:35:31,213
Our relaunch was June 2017, so year to the day.

653
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:41,534
It sounded like the second relaunch was better or more successful.

654
00:35:42,735 --> 00:35:47,099
So the week of our relaunch was our highest grossing sales of all time.

655
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:51,704
And we we sort of defied the trend in that for most people

656
00:35:53,345 --> 00:35:55,748
your first year is basically like.

657
00:35:56,172 --> 00:35:57,914
the majority of what you're going to make.

658
00:35:59,075 --> 00:36:01,176
I know Jake Perkett is here in the audience somewhere.

659
00:36:01,216 --> 00:36:03,318
He gave some lovely talks about assessing

660
00:36:03,378 --> 00:36:05,160
sort of first week and first year sales

661
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:05,840
and things like that.

662
00:36:06,861 --> 00:36:08,522
For us, our second year of sales

663
00:36:08,783 --> 00:36:10,864
is actually significantly higher than our first year.

664
00:36:11,185 --> 00:36:12,085
Actually, ours was too.

665
00:36:13,266 --> 00:36:16,409
Yeah, so my question is, after your first lunch,

666
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,447
What made you think you could relaunch and then what decisions are like?

667
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:24,211
What did you kind of what do you think contributed most to?

668
00:36:24,231 --> 00:36:27,878
Kind of changing that trajectory and and had her be successful

669
00:36:28,524 --> 00:36:32,586
Um, yeah, uh, so, uh, a couple things.

670
00:36:32,806 --> 00:36:39,849
One is just that there were some very discreet decisions that became very

671
00:36:39,889 --> 00:36:42,851
apparent were wrong, uh, after our launch.

672
00:36:42,971 --> 00:36:45,292
So the biggest one is our control scheme.

673
00:36:45,832 --> 00:36:47,553
So we launched Brigador with tank controls.

674
00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:51,055
Um, turns out no one plays tank controls anymore.

675
00:36:53,164 --> 00:36:58,528
And in my mind, so it's possible to be right and wrong at the same time.

676
00:36:58,748 --> 00:37:04,392
So to me, I was right in that, yes, tank controls are the best control scheme for this game

677
00:37:04,452 --> 00:37:05,673
because we designed it for that.

678
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:09,396
I was wrong in that no one wants to learn tank controls.

679
00:37:10,636 --> 00:37:16,901
So once we added in a twin stick style, we actually had a working variant of that before

680
00:37:16,961 --> 00:37:18,162
original launch, and I cut it.

681
00:37:18,542 --> 00:37:21,124
Because I was like, I am more intelligent than these gamers.

682
00:37:23,746 --> 00:37:26,007
Once we put that back in as part of the relaunch and a

683
00:37:26,047 --> 00:37:29,569
bunch of other, there were very discreet decisions that I

684
00:37:29,589 --> 00:37:31,030
could clearly say, these are wrong.

685
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,792
And looking at those in aggregate, plus localizing and

686
00:37:34,812 --> 00:37:36,133
a few other things, it was like.

687
00:37:37,238 --> 00:37:38,919
You know, I think this is worth it.

688
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:41,280
And I talked to a lot of people who were like,

689
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,701
this is, your launch sucked way worse than it should have.

690
00:37:46,902 --> 00:37:48,483
So it was kind of like an aggregate decision.

691
00:37:48,643 --> 00:37:53,184
Also the fact that I was emotionally incapable

692
00:37:53,325 --> 00:37:54,605
of just stopping there.

693
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:57,566
So it kind of like wasn't really a decision, but anyway.

694
00:37:58,547 --> 00:37:58,847
Thank you.

695
00:37:59,267 --> 00:38:01,048
I mean, hit me up if you want to talk later, yeah.

696
00:38:02,483 --> 00:38:03,823
So I'm Chris.

697
00:38:03,923 --> 00:38:05,284
My question's actually of a similar vein,

698
00:38:05,304 --> 00:38:07,004
and I guess it really goes to both of you,

699
00:38:07,524 --> 00:38:09,185
as to I know a lot of people when they have a launch

700
00:38:09,205 --> 00:38:11,085
that doesn't go well, like,

701
00:38:12,086 --> 00:38:14,907
their concerns are that they spend more energy, more time,

702
00:38:15,107 --> 00:38:16,647
it's just gonna be spinning their tires in the mud,

703
00:38:17,247 --> 00:38:19,608
and they're not sure, like, should they cut their losses

704
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,529
and just, you know, was their timing wrong

705
00:38:21,569 --> 00:38:22,809
and they gotta take their bet on the next thing?

706
00:38:23,449 --> 00:38:25,110
Can you talk us through, I'm sure there's at least

707
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,130
some consideration as to that.

708
00:38:27,019 --> 00:38:29,883
kind of like before you decide to really double down on that effort,

709
00:38:30,283 --> 00:38:32,486
kind of what goes into that sort of thinking as to whether or not

710
00:38:33,547 --> 00:38:35,329
here comes the next project as opposed to like

711
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,872
sinking all those resources back into it.

712
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:41,571
That could be an hour on its own.

713
00:38:43,052 --> 00:38:47,795
I guess my core advice there would be to treat every game

714
00:38:47,835 --> 00:38:48,215
differently.

715
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:50,696
It's not that you can look at any given game and say,

716
00:38:50,796 --> 00:38:51,877
oh, this game did it that way.

717
00:38:51,917 --> 00:38:52,858
I'm going to do it that way.

718
00:38:53,378 --> 00:38:56,920
Every game has its own problems and triumphs.

719
00:38:57,761 --> 00:39:01,343
So it is worthwhile to see if there

720
00:39:01,543 --> 00:39:03,764
are others who have tried exactly what you're going

721
00:39:03,784 --> 00:39:05,245
to try and have failed to do so.

722
00:39:05,325 --> 00:39:07,706
It's very hard to find failures, but they are out there.

723
00:39:09,007 --> 00:39:12,691
And I think you also need to ask yourself whether the costs,

724
00:39:13,612 --> 00:39:16,634
emotionally and financially, are worth the risk.

725
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:20,918
Because we knew that we were going into this with maybe getting nothing out of it,

726
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:22,019
and we were okay with that.

727
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:27,745
But part of that might have been because we weren't completely bitter and burnt out at that point yet.

728
00:39:29,526 --> 00:39:30,527
So it's different for every game.

729
00:39:31,848 --> 00:39:32,989
What I would say about that is...

730
00:39:35,287 --> 00:39:42,092
I think a lot of that has to do with, like, what is your intention as an indie developer?

731
00:39:42,273 --> 00:39:46,016
Like, is this a one and done, or are you a lifer?

732
00:39:46,616 --> 00:39:53,682
Because in my case, we, so my brother and I co-founded the studio together, and it's

733
00:39:56,336 --> 00:39:59,301
We're in the kind of indie games or die kind of mentality

734
00:39:59,401 --> 00:40:01,985
where our creations are so precious to us

735
00:40:02,245 --> 00:40:04,990
that we're going to stick with it regardless.

736
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:08,195
And as much as he occasionally accuses me

737
00:40:08,255 --> 00:40:09,617
of George Lucas-ing the game,

738
00:40:11,882 --> 00:40:15,064
I think, uh, you know, because games have really long tails.

739
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:19,166
And I, hopefully, like I still play the original XCOM,

740
00:40:20,007 --> 00:40:24,109
uh, and people like that, that game still has a living community.

741
00:40:24,369 --> 00:40:26,770
And not, I mean, should be so lucky, but at the same time,

742
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:29,012
it's like, if someone plays Brigador in 10 years,

743
00:40:29,812 --> 00:40:33,454
um, I wanted to make sure that that's still like a rock-solid experience.

744
00:40:33,494 --> 00:40:35,935
And I realized that there were changes that we needed to make to do that.

745
00:40:36,416 --> 00:40:36,496
And...

746
00:40:37,457 --> 00:40:38,959
We were fortunate in that in our case,

747
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:41,203
we're working on a second game that uses the same engine.

748
00:40:41,283 --> 00:40:43,106
So a lot of the additions and changes

749
00:40:43,146 --> 00:40:45,911
that we made to the engine to fix Brigador,

750
00:40:46,352 --> 00:40:48,295
it's like, well, we're just doing pre-production

751
00:40:48,315 --> 00:40:49,818
for game two, so it worked out.

752
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:50,559
Awesome.

753
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,020
Thanks, Hal.

754
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,199
Hi, my name is Aubrey Scott.

755
00:40:54,779 --> 00:40:59,361
I'm actually wondering, because you both talked

756
00:40:59,401 --> 00:41:03,684
about the stories of other game developers kind of failing,

757
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,625
being a really healing experience for you,

758
00:41:06,065 --> 00:41:08,426
to hear and kind of commiserate together.

759
00:41:08,446 --> 00:41:12,808
I'm wondering what you feel like would have to happen

760
00:41:12,828 --> 00:41:15,710
to make that a more normal part of the culture,

761
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:18,751
to kind of cultivate that and have those stories out there

762
00:41:18,911 --> 00:41:20,452
and for it to be more normal to.

763
00:41:20,472 --> 00:41:21,633
It's what we're doing right now.

764
00:41:22,633 --> 00:41:25,455
I mean, I'm entirely serious where, like, that was...

765
00:41:26,356 --> 00:41:27,717
I mean, I'm going to be honest, I didn't...

766
00:41:28,238 --> 00:41:31,860
It wasn't my intent when I first, like, started yelling on the internet

767
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,921
about how everything sucks.

768
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:34,963
My mind wasn't like,

769
00:41:35,463 --> 00:41:37,024
I'm going to help the indie community.

770
00:41:38,986 --> 00:41:42,189
I'm glad that happened and I've kind of embraced that.

771
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:48,194
But at the end of the day, it's just, part of it is just building your community, right?

772
00:41:48,315 --> 00:41:51,898
And like finding people who are in similar situations and commiserating.

773
00:41:51,958 --> 00:41:56,903
I mean like it's, you, there's, it helps to just...

774
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:00,753
talk to other devs in all states of life.

775
00:42:00,813 --> 00:42:04,035
And again, I have had a really wonderful experience

776
00:42:04,095 --> 00:42:05,897
with the game development community,

777
00:42:06,217 --> 00:42:09,600
both Indie and AAA, where I've cold emailed

778
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,922
the weirdest people where it's like,

779
00:42:13,122 --> 00:42:14,664
you're a technical director at this place.

780
00:42:14,884 --> 00:42:16,385
I'm an independent game designer.

781
00:42:17,206 --> 00:42:18,647
Please read this two page long email.

782
00:42:19,848 --> 00:42:21,389
And I've had people actually

783
00:42:23,508 --> 00:42:26,010
not only humor me, but I actually give very thoughtful responses.

784
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:28,952
And I think just, it starts with just reaching out to people.

785
00:42:29,412 --> 00:42:33,294
Um, and, uh, when you are going through a situation,

786
00:42:33,314 --> 00:42:37,456
I mean, I, cause we talk a lot, we've, like, as in developers,

787
00:42:37,496 --> 00:42:40,958
I've had a lot of private communications with, with other developers

788
00:42:40,978 --> 00:42:42,960
who are having a hard time and other things like that.

789
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,322
It's not always necessary or even, uh, a good thing

790
00:42:47,402 --> 00:42:50,764
to publicize some of these things, or some of your, your stressors.

791
00:42:51,284 --> 00:42:52,525
But also, like...

792
00:42:53,776 --> 00:42:57,961
you know, if you can talk to people about it, or if you do have an experience that you

793
00:42:58,001 --> 00:43:01,806
think other people are going to have and could be shared, or you know, someone else who's

794
00:43:01,826 --> 00:43:05,971
in that similar situation, I think if you contribute to that sort of body of knowledge

795
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,635
and that experience, that can make a difference.

796
00:43:09,797 --> 00:43:15,578
I'd like to add I'm in my hobbies. I'm also the co-organizer of a feminist organization

797
00:43:15,638 --> 00:43:20,200
And I can tell you that any cultural change is very slow and it starts personally

798
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:28,442
so anytime you in your life can notice when you are overvaluing someone because they have this aura of success or

799
00:43:29,082 --> 00:43:32,665
when you catch you and your friends like admiring someone

800
00:43:32,765 --> 00:43:36,688
because only they've kind of perfected this sheen,

801
00:43:37,609 --> 00:43:40,071
just question that and really think about that

802
00:43:40,231 --> 00:43:41,772
and think about who your heroes are

803
00:43:41,792 --> 00:43:43,674
and what are the kind of values

804
00:43:43,914 --> 00:43:45,775
that you want to broadcast to other people

805
00:43:46,096 --> 00:43:47,397
and I think we'll make the world better.

806
00:43:48,297 --> 00:43:48,698
Thank you.

807
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:51,440
We have to call it there

808
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,863
and I think that is a perfect note to end on.

809
00:43:55,043 --> 00:43:55,883
Thank you so much.

810
00:43:55,903 --> 00:43:57,505
It was brilliantly articulated.
