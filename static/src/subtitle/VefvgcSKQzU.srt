1
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:05,420
Okay.

2
00:00:06,843 --> 00:00:07,925
All right, I guess it's time for me to,

3
00:00:08,105 --> 00:00:08,747
wow, that's echo.

4
00:00:08,867 --> 00:00:09,508
All right, big room.

5
00:00:09,668 --> 00:00:11,913
All right, Sartin, welcome to the talk.

6
00:00:12,654 --> 00:00:14,458
This is the last 10 going from good to awesome.

7
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:18,135
Or SM as we like to say at work if you're a South Park fan

8
00:00:18,636 --> 00:00:19,716
My name is Benson Russell

9
00:00:20,357 --> 00:00:24,919
And I'm a senior game designer at Naughty Dog and just a little bit of history on me briefly

10
00:00:24,939 --> 00:00:28,121
I used to work at EA Los Angeles on the Medal of Honor franchise

11
00:00:28,482 --> 00:00:31,624
I worked way back in the day at Ritual Entertainment on a Star Trek game and

12
00:00:31,644 --> 00:00:33,765
For those of you who've been in the industry way a long time

13
00:00:33,785 --> 00:00:37,447
I was a founder of 2015 where we did the original Medal of Honor Allied Assault for PC

14
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:42,503
I worked on both the Uncharted 2, all Uncharted games, and for Uncharted 2 and 3 I was the

15
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:43,943
primary AI and combat designer.

16
00:00:44,523 --> 00:00:47,685
So just a quick note, don't forget the little email thing that's going to send out, you

17
00:00:47,705 --> 00:00:50,946
know, rate me, however, I swear to God I will not buy your boat.

18
00:00:51,346 --> 00:00:55,468
And another thing is the talk, I have tons of information, I'm going to go right up to

19
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:55,928
the last minute.

20
00:00:55,948 --> 00:00:59,509
So I won't have time for questions, but if you want, hit me up outside, wherever, and

21
00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:00,109
we'll go from there.

22
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:00,430
So.

23
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,812
Let us go on with what this talk is actually going to be about.

24
00:01:03,832 --> 00:01:05,774
No, don't do that, you stupid thing.

25
00:01:05,794 --> 00:01:07,335
All right.

26
00:01:07,555 --> 00:01:08,996
I love it when my notes crap up on me.

27
00:01:09,296 --> 00:01:10,457
So quick overview.

28
00:01:10,777 --> 00:01:11,038
The last 10.

29
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,239
You've heard the phrase, last 10% takes 90% of the work.

30
00:01:14,884 --> 00:01:18,126
Also refer to this as polish and at Naughty Dog

31
00:01:18,506 --> 00:01:22,967
We believe this is what can take a great game and make it absolutely awesome and to us

32
00:01:23,028 --> 00:01:26,389
It's arguably one of the most important aspects of the game development cycle

33
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:31,851
But in our experience it seems to also be one of the most marginalized aspects of the game development cycle

34
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:36,033
But I'm here to give a talk about how the fix can be easier than it might seem

35
00:01:36,968 --> 00:01:41,672
It's basically it's going to involve the change in mindset of what you're going to what you need to look for the level detail

36
00:01:41,692 --> 00:01:48,658
You want to aspire to and then also a better distribution of your development time and pretty much a good tell the industry for us

37
00:01:48,678 --> 00:01:54,983
Is every person we've hired it naughty dog goes through the same process every game when we go into the polish phase the new people

38
00:01:55,023 --> 00:01:58,926
Are like you want to fix what you know it's like literally that level of detail

39
00:01:58,946 --> 00:02:02,449
They're like you're nuts what we don't fix this before it's like well. We do so hence

40
00:02:03,137 --> 00:02:07,360
It's kind of a tell us that maybe more the industry isn't doing this as much as we kind of would hope they would.

41
00:02:08,281 --> 00:02:21,771
Alright, so this also this talk is me about how we approached polish and uncharted 2 uncharted 3. Now this quick disclaimer. The first thing to note is that this is by no means a perfect system. This is what works for us. This is also the system that.

42
00:02:22,894 --> 00:02:51,484
We've been refined. We're continuing to refine overtime. In fact, it's controversial internally, like when I was talking people getting information for this talk or asking them what they you know what they think of it. I got a lot of the that's not right. We hated that. Why did you want to talk about that? That's crazy. That's not what we did for policy with you stupid. So yeah, even internally we have a little bit of strife over it, but the key approach and take away or the key takeaway for this entire talk is that you need to allow time for polish and don't just let it sit in the rest of the mix and I'll go over that a little bit later.

43
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:54,447
So, what am I defining as polish?

44
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:58,388
Well, the first thing is it is not about iterating and finding your gameplay mechanics.

45
00:02:58,728 --> 00:03:00,468
You should have that known by this point in the game.

46
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:04,049
This is about wrapping it up and getting it ready for public consumption.

47
00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:05,289
You want to finalize that product.

48
00:03:05,949 --> 00:03:09,790
And just like you do with a car, when you polish it, it's the act of removing the blemishes

49
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,730
and the imperfections.

50
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:15,391
Anything that can take the user out of the experience and make them no longer immersed.

51
00:03:17,292 --> 00:03:19,972
Some high level examples of what I'm talking about.

52
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:21,921
My slides work here.

53
00:03:21,981 --> 00:03:22,281
There we go.

54
00:03:22,561 --> 00:03:23,482
Gameplay related issues.

55
00:03:23,522 --> 00:03:25,744
And this can be anything from, say, glitchy controls.

56
00:03:26,024 --> 00:03:26,865
Are they frustrating?

57
00:03:27,265 --> 00:03:30,447
Can the player easily translate what he wants to do

58
00:03:30,828 --> 00:03:32,189
into his actions into his avatar?

59
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,531
Could also be wonky world interactions, like bad

60
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:36,132
collisions.

61
00:03:36,192 --> 00:03:39,334
So artists love to make, hey, I'm going to make collision

62
00:03:39,354 --> 00:03:40,995
around all this little tiny, wonderful stuff.

63
00:03:41,035 --> 00:03:43,097
And the player comes and walks along with his feet IK, and

64
00:03:43,137 --> 00:03:44,058
his feet are dancing in the air.

65
00:03:44,078 --> 00:03:46,179
And then he turns into the physics ball of goo that

66
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:47,220
bounces off into space.

67
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,061
And you want to go smack your artist in the face.

68
00:03:50,732 --> 00:03:53,993
It could also be like difficulty controllers, or sorry, bad difficulty spikes.

69
00:03:54,893 --> 00:03:59,115
And pretty much all those translate to controller into television screen, which is what you

70
00:03:59,175 --> 00:03:59,875
really want to avoid.

71
00:04:00,755 --> 00:04:04,117
It could also be visual presentation issues, like a confusing interface.

72
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:05,757
Are your menu items clear and concise?

73
00:04:06,198 --> 00:04:07,198
Can they find the data they need?

74
00:04:07,238 --> 00:04:08,899
Is the HUD overcrowded?

75
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:12,160
You know, does it, do they, can the player get the information he needs at any time?

76
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,382
It could also be anything from like bad animation pops or blends or awkward timing, which is

77
00:04:17,422 --> 00:04:19,062
exactly what I'm doing right now in this speech.

78
00:04:19,783 --> 00:04:19,903
So.

79
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:26,304
And the third thing I kind of group into a category. We as game developers think is called status quo.

80
00:04:26,644 --> 00:04:28,947
And the litmus test for this is if you sit there and you go,

81
00:04:30,909 --> 00:04:34,412
it's a game, they'll deal with it. No.

82
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:37,675
If you say that about anything, you probably need to actually put your head down and be like,

83
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:39,277
well, maybe I should actually consider fixing this.

84
00:04:41,762 --> 00:04:43,884
Our approach that we took on Uncharted 2 and Uncharted 3.

85
00:04:44,204 --> 00:04:48,489
Well, the first thing you have to do is you need to set the quality bar really high.

86
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:51,051
And this is what I mean specifically about a change in mindset.

87
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:53,934
And I'm going to, I'll go over here in just a little bit with some examples.

88
00:04:55,256 --> 00:04:56,437
You want to shoot for perfection.

89
00:04:56,677 --> 00:04:57,378
Don't settle.

90
00:04:57,718 --> 00:05:00,041
Don't sit there and accept something as the status quo.

91
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:04,145
Don't, you know, if you see a little bad pop or a blend or something, take the time to fix it.

92
00:05:04,285 --> 00:05:04,465
You know.

93
00:05:05,184 --> 00:05:07,766
As long as you give yourself the time, which is another thing I'm going to go over here.

94
00:05:08,326 --> 00:05:13,370
All the small things that you think, stop doing that, all the small things that you

95
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,191
just let slip through, yeah you might be able to have one here and one there in your shipping

96
00:05:16,231 --> 00:05:16,552
product.

97
00:05:16,912 --> 00:05:20,834
The more of these small things you have, it just chips away at the overall feel of polish

98
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:21,235
in the game.

99
00:05:21,575 --> 00:05:26,238
Like, even if on a subconscious level, it's just the player is going to realize, kind

100
00:05:26,258 --> 00:05:29,180
of feel awkward, like, I'm not really playing a completed game here, so why do I care?

101
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,582
Let's see, and now for some video examples.

102
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:37,800
And I've got some better ones even later, but these are just, I wanted to at least spread them out so you maintain your interest.

103
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,761
And I'm going to quiz you on it.

104
00:05:39,482 --> 00:05:40,903
So this first example is from Uncharted 3.

105
00:05:41,224 --> 00:05:46,409
It's where we're training the player how to do pull-around stealth kills in the London Underground.

106
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:48,571
The guy who we want to watch in this video is Cutter.

107
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:49,532
He's the one on the left.

108
00:05:50,052 --> 00:05:51,253
Take a look at what he does.

109
00:05:51,273 --> 00:05:54,817
Take them out quietly.

110
00:05:55,537 --> 00:05:56,398
All right, we got ninja mode.

111
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:02,486
Attack, yes, kill, yes, and oh, oh, and go ahead and desecrate his corpse, why don't

112
00:06:02,506 --> 00:06:02,626
you?

113
00:06:02,806 --> 00:06:03,607
Yes, just stand on him.

114
00:06:04,307 --> 00:06:05,588
You stupid AI.

115
00:06:06,448 --> 00:06:07,508
That phrase wasn't uttered enough.

116
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:12,050
So what it should look like when it's actually polished is this.

117
00:06:15,572 --> 00:06:16,252
Ninja mode again.

118
00:06:16,272 --> 00:06:17,433
Hit the button.

119
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,674
And just like they say in tennis and golf, a great follow through.

120
00:06:21,385 --> 00:06:22,325
It's exactly what you want.

121
00:06:22,786 --> 00:06:24,906
And honestly, that was a real simple fix.

122
00:06:25,727 --> 00:06:29,669
It was just a minor line in script that basically was when they were playing the animations

123
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:34,171
on the two guys, as he was going through his swing, the animation on the guy that was supposed

124
00:06:34,211 --> 00:06:38,272
to die ragdolled him too soon, so he didn't get any momentum to follow through with the

125
00:06:38,292 --> 00:06:38,653
rest of it.

126
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:42,414
And it was just a small line change in fix made it that much better.

127
00:06:42,434 --> 00:06:43,455
All right.

128
00:06:44,355 --> 00:06:45,536
Game glitches, or camera glitches.

129
00:06:45,596 --> 00:06:48,077
Now this one I might have to play for you twice, because every time I've tested this

130
00:06:48,137 --> 00:06:49,117
one people, they don't notice it.

131
00:06:49,738 --> 00:06:50,298
See if you find it.

132
00:06:53,164 --> 00:06:54,245
that you see a pop

133
00:06:55,626 --> 00:06:56,466
i will play again

134
00:06:58,848 --> 00:06:59,949
watches the camera tilts

135
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:01,170
point there

136
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,411
that little glitch

137
00:07:03,391 --> 00:07:03,751
fix that

138
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:08,040
It makes your game just feel awkward and unpolished.

139
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,682
In fact, well, I got the video, so I might as well show you what it looks like when it's

140
00:07:12,702 --> 00:07:12,942
fixed.

141
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:13,362
See?

142
00:07:14,262 --> 00:07:15,803
No glitch, much nicer, much smoother.

143
00:07:15,863 --> 00:07:17,404
And again, this was an easy fix in script.

144
00:07:17,664 --> 00:07:21,966
It was basically the camera was playing an animated path, and we have a command in the

145
00:07:21,986 --> 00:07:25,068
game that pauses the game, puts the menu up, and says, wait for this button to be pressed

146
00:07:25,088 --> 00:07:25,508
for training.

147
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:30,370
And so then what happens is, even though that command was issued to pause the game,

148
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:33,732
the script would execute one more line of code because of the way the engine works,

149
00:07:34,073 --> 00:07:35,553
and thus the camera started moving.

150
00:07:35,573 --> 00:07:38,115
So it was just a matter of putting an extra, like, weight one frame in there

151
00:07:38,195 --> 00:07:41,417
to give the script enough time to get that buffer in there,

152
00:07:41,877 --> 00:07:42,838
and then it was not a problem.

153
00:07:42,858 --> 00:07:45,759
All right, now this one is a sequence of events,

154
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,740
and I'll just let this one play, and I'll go over it afterwards.

155
00:07:51,506 --> 00:07:52,468
Hey, Nate, over here.

156
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:54,410
I think we can cut through the building.

157
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:55,772
Here, help me with this.

158
00:07:55,812 --> 00:07:58,677
What are you doing, Elena?

159
00:07:58,717 --> 00:07:59,638
Why are you standing there?

160
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:00,619
What are you doing?

161
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,863
Get the door, you stupid AI.

162
00:08:05,926 --> 00:08:10,787
In that whole sequence, you can see there was an awkward dialogue moment where she's

163
00:08:10,827 --> 00:08:13,748
walking over telling Nate we need to go to the door and Nate goes, yeah, good call, but

164
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:14,949
her dialogue stomps it.

165
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:19,310
So they're both saying things at the exact same time, which is difficult for the player

166
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,331
because now you have to kind of filter out what was going on.

167
00:08:21,351 --> 00:08:21,911
What did she say?

168
00:08:21,931 --> 00:08:22,931
Did I just say a response?

169
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:30,133
And then she decides to walk over the door and is like, oh, yeah, this, sorry, you want

170
00:08:30,153 --> 00:08:30,233
that?

171
00:08:30,493 --> 00:08:30,913
Yeah.

172
00:08:31,214 --> 00:08:31,474
Why?

173
00:08:31,534 --> 00:08:32,414
There was no reason for that.

174
00:08:32,434 --> 00:08:35,015
The polished version of it should look like this.

175
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:41,234
Hey Nate, over here. I think we can cut through the building.

176
00:08:41,715 --> 00:08:42,375
Alright, good call.

177
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:43,777
Here, help me lift this.

178
00:08:45,138 --> 00:08:45,979
And she goes right to it.

179
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,003
And there was no stopping of dialogue, everything's wonderful,

180
00:08:49,483 --> 00:08:51,906
order is restoring the world, peace in the Middle East. Yay.

181
00:08:53,127 --> 00:08:53,227
So.

182
00:08:54,845 --> 00:08:56,786
That's what I'm talking about with the mindset change.

183
00:08:56,806 --> 00:08:58,508
I mean, some of these might seem really small.

184
00:08:58,888 --> 00:09:00,249
I've got some even smaller ones for you

185
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:01,730
that'll come later on in the presentation.

186
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,712
Evan Wells, our co-president, is the master

187
00:09:04,772 --> 00:09:06,693
at breaking things and finding little things to polish.

188
00:09:06,893 --> 00:09:07,854
And oh my God.

189
00:09:08,655 --> 00:09:08,915
We'll go on.

190
00:09:08,935 --> 00:09:11,316
All right, so that's what we're talking about

191
00:09:11,336 --> 00:09:11,877
in terms of polish.

192
00:09:11,897 --> 00:09:13,238
Now let's talk about how we do it.

193
00:09:13,658 --> 00:09:14,899
So the first thing is schedule.

194
00:09:15,739 --> 00:09:15,840
Now,

195
00:09:16,478 --> 00:09:22,989
It's easy to say. Let's say this is kind of a representation of what a standard development cycle is that most companies you've

196
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:29,740
got pre-production a very long production very short alpha very short beta ratio gold and everyone's happy we hit gold.

197
00:09:30,844 --> 00:09:34,526
The key thing to note though is with a short alpha and a short beta, most people in their

198
00:09:34,546 --> 00:09:37,287
studios tend to be like, alpha is almost a gold candidate.

199
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:44,331
It's like final art, near zero bugs, everything is polished and ready and voila, it's fantastic.

200
00:09:44,831 --> 00:09:48,773
The problem with this approach is people just leave polish into the production cycle because

201
00:09:48,793 --> 00:09:49,934
they don't actually schedule for it.

202
00:09:50,354 --> 00:09:53,615
So you're just like, oh you've got this much time to work on your level, make it as awesome

203
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:54,596
as you can before alpha.

204
00:09:55,116 --> 00:09:57,197
But of course in reality what happens is the OH MY GOD!

205
00:09:58,338 --> 00:09:59,818
and everyone's running around with chickens,

206
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,239
you know, headless chickens, just get the game done.

207
00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:03,279
You know, get it out the door.

208
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:05,020
That's what everyone starts falling onto

209
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,041
and hence polish falls by the wayside.

210
00:10:09,181 --> 00:10:10,842
So what we do at Naughty Dog is

211
00:10:10,862 --> 00:10:11,922
is we change it up a little bit.

212
00:10:12,482 --> 00:10:14,343
We actually use our alpha and our beta time

213
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,143
for polish instead.

214
00:10:15,503 --> 00:10:17,084
So we reduce our production time

215
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:19,185
and then we specifically say we're hitting alpha.

216
00:10:19,265 --> 00:10:20,825
In fact, in Uncharted 3 it was four months

217
00:10:21,345 --> 00:10:21,966
we gave ourselves.

218
00:10:22,146 --> 00:10:24,146
And in future projects, we want to give ourselves

219
00:10:24,186 --> 00:10:26,127
even more time because we felt that wasn't enough.

220
00:10:26,774 --> 00:10:30,156
But let's see, where did I go?

221
00:10:30,757 --> 00:10:32,518
I lost myself on my notes, pardon me for a second.

222
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,359
So for those of you who want to put a number on it,

223
00:10:34,819 --> 00:10:36,660
if you want to polish in the alpha and beta phase like we do,

224
00:10:37,241 --> 00:10:39,322
allocate at least 20 to 25% of your schedule.

225
00:10:40,503 --> 00:10:41,603
One gotcha in this approach, though,

226
00:10:41,644 --> 00:10:44,005
is you kind of want to hit a solid alpha as much as you can.

227
00:10:44,585 --> 00:10:46,487
And internally, this was one of the controversial subjects

228
00:10:46,527 --> 00:10:49,248
of like, we hit maybe sort of, kind of an alpha.

229
00:10:49,308 --> 00:10:51,390
Well, maybe it was an A, at the very least.

230
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,091
You know, not quite the alpha.

231
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:54,211
So...

232
00:10:56,452 --> 00:11:00,594
Now, as a quick side note, the one nice thing about shortening your production schedule

233
00:11:00,855 --> 00:11:03,956
is it gives you more time to make an evaluation on difficult things earlier.

234
00:11:04,257 --> 00:11:08,339
So if you have systems or parts of the games that are not quite, look like they're not

235
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:12,261
going to hit their schedule, because you've reduced your production time and you've moved

236
00:11:12,281 --> 00:11:15,643
that alpha up, you can say, oh, well maybe we need to cut it, maybe we need to trim it

237
00:11:15,683 --> 00:11:18,165
down or eliminate these features, whatever.

238
00:11:18,225 --> 00:11:21,867
But it allows you to self-edit, you know, and go for quality over quantity.

239
00:11:22,087 --> 00:11:23,788
And that's something that we feel is very important.

240
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:40,453
So back to this whole scheduling thing in order for this to work, you have to not fear change. Most of the studios I've worked at and people I talked to the moment you talk about like get it out for beta. The standard practices do not touch the hell's wrong with you. I'm trying to ship this game. You're going to break it.

241
00:11:40,473 --> 00:11:48,781
It's like well, no, you're not. If you give yourself enough time and you allocate accordingly, you can actually apply your policy in alpha so.

242
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,620
What I'd like to propose is a little bit of a following change in definition when we go through this stuff.

243
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,361
So pre-production is still, you know, you're prototyping R&D, fleshing out your core.

244
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,582
Production is still the grunt work of the game.

245
00:12:01,442 --> 00:12:05,443
When you get to alpha, though, our definition of alpha is the game is playable from start to finish.

246
00:12:06,063 --> 00:12:09,484
All mechanics are implemented, but they're in a rough form.

247
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:13,504
Puzzles and systems and gameplay like combat, exploring sections, even the art,

248
00:12:13,864 --> 00:12:15,565
they're all in there, but they're in a rough form.

249
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:19,180
To some way and then you're not really concerned about your bugs

250
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,022
You because now is the time when the beta testers are going to start playing the game any bugs up to this point?

251
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:23,563
We're pretty much

252
00:12:23,623 --> 00:12:29,766
You know or you next to useless unless you're you know having an e3 demo or something because of course it was still in production

253
00:12:30,406 --> 00:12:36,950
So and also at this point stability is paramount so class a bug should be top priority anytime the game is broken

254
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:40,172
It doesn't matter who's on what whose job it is to fix it

255
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,813
They stop what they're doing you go fix it so that way everyone can keep working

256
00:12:43,987 --> 00:12:48,249
And then when we get to beta, our definition of that is the majority of polish has been

257
00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:52,292
applied, levels should be looking and playing really well, of course the game should be

258
00:12:52,352 --> 00:12:54,853
really stable because you're about to damn put the thing out the door.

259
00:12:55,554 --> 00:12:59,676
And as many critical and high priority bugs are pretty much fixed, and at this point you're

260
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:03,638
also like bugs are being waived, like lower bugs at this point are totally being waived,

261
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:04,639
it's like no we're not fixing that.

262
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:09,622
Polish can still happen, but there's an approval process that we go through, and I'll tell

263
00:13:09,642 --> 00:13:12,203
you about that a little bit later as one of our little tips and tricks section.

264
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:39,086
Now one thing from the controversy that talking people inside the studio is we wanted to add is his hands off section. So the idea is that alright. So we did this work during alpha and beta. Yes, there's a chance that a bug might have been reduced. This is where the entire game is beta and it only is in the hands of the programmers and the testers. You're just playing the game looking for anything that can cause a major breakage and that that way you're not polishing anything more. You're not fixing bugs. You're not doing anything. You're not touching anything that can cause more bugs. It's just actually.

265
00:13:39,882 --> 00:13:46,393
We were lucky enough to find one in uncharted 3 that was a really nasty level loading bug that would have caused a crash on probably 20 to 25% of the systems out there.

266
00:13:46,854 --> 00:13:52,943
It was a really hard one to find, so it was kind of like who you think God and then of course you had gold and everyone's happy.

267
00:13:52,963 --> 00:13:53,464
So.

268
00:13:55,897 --> 00:13:56,677
Let me get on here.

269
00:13:56,777 --> 00:13:57,458
Rolling deadline, sorry.

270
00:13:57,918 --> 00:13:59,038
If that's the scheduling side of it,

271
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:00,839
now I'm gonna talk about some of the tips and tricks

272
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:04,061
that we use on how we manage all that stuff.

273
00:14:04,501 --> 00:14:06,022
So, the rolling deadline,

274
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,564
one thing that can really fight against you

275
00:14:09,464 --> 00:14:12,786
when you're working on this wonderful, magnificent opus

276
00:14:12,806 --> 00:14:15,588
that you're creating is the gigantor game

277
00:14:15,808 --> 00:14:16,688
that you have made.

278
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,729
It is huge, it is relentless,

279
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:20,070
it wants to suck your soul.

280
00:14:20,831 --> 00:14:23,612
So, I mean, you get to this problem of like,

281
00:14:24,294 --> 00:14:28,577
Hey, person A needs to talk to person B to get his stuff done, but person B is doing

282
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:31,740
something for person C because he's got to work on a different part of the game.

283
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,302
And then all of a sudden person D is pining for person A and nobody's getting anything

284
00:14:35,322 --> 00:14:35,563
done at all.

285
00:14:36,283 --> 00:14:41,287
So what we like to do instead is we take the game and we split it up into sections.

286
00:14:41,527 --> 00:14:43,549
Specifically for Uncharted 3 it was three sections.

287
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:47,271
And each section will go through its own alpha beta gold period.

288
00:14:47,692 --> 00:14:49,994
And then what we do is we stagger them on the schedule.

289
00:14:50,434 --> 00:14:52,155
So the idea is that if we have that four months...

290
00:14:52,816 --> 00:14:55,079
that I talked about to ship to get the rest of the project done.

291
00:14:55,099 --> 00:14:57,321
We split that four months into the across these four sections.

292
00:14:58,082 --> 00:15:01,025
The sections that are most ready to be completed go in section one.

293
00:15:01,065 --> 00:15:04,729
The sections that are next most ready section two and the least ready go in section three.

294
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,332
So you'll notice section one hits alpha.

295
00:15:07,996 --> 00:15:14,082
Section one is dedicated all to itself until there will be a time when section two's alpha will have to kick in and there will be some overlap.

296
00:15:14,502 --> 00:15:20,468
That's fine, but at least you know if you're working on a level in section one, you have the artists and the animators are focused on you.

297
00:15:20,869 --> 00:15:23,811
And same with programmer time. That is the priority. They're getting that done right now.

298
00:15:24,748 --> 00:15:26,409
And same thing as you move through the rest of the sections.

299
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:29,672
Big gotcha on this one though is watch the overlap.

300
00:15:29,872 --> 00:15:31,514
This killed us a little bit on charted three,

301
00:15:31,534 --> 00:15:34,397
hence another reason we want to say we want more time

302
00:15:34,437 --> 00:15:36,499
in the schedule to push these things out even further.

303
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,421
In actuality, our section one didn't finish

304
00:15:39,461 --> 00:15:40,743
until about the end of section two.

305
00:15:42,064 --> 00:15:42,805
Did I say that aloud?

306
00:15:43,045 --> 00:15:43,545
Oh, crap.

307
00:15:43,906 --> 00:15:44,006
So.

308
00:15:44,814 --> 00:15:45,375
Let me leave that up.

309
00:15:45,615 --> 00:15:49,698
So one other nice thing that we use for this is we use bug count totals to go with the

310
00:15:49,738 --> 00:15:51,139
sections in terms of alpha and beta gold.

311
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,883
And what I mean by that is so level hits alpha, bugs are coming in, you're just, you're balancing

312
00:15:55,923 --> 00:15:58,045
polishing with fixing, balancing polishing with fixing.

313
00:15:58,646 --> 00:16:03,330
At some point, Kristof sends an email saying, okay, this is your bug count total.

314
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,451
You want to have no more than this.

315
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:06,152
And it's about halfway through alpha.

316
00:16:06,752 --> 00:16:08,653
And then, so now you want to have that or less.

317
00:16:09,073 --> 00:16:10,614
So that it helps you focus your attention of like,

318
00:16:10,714 --> 00:16:12,896
oh, I need to make sure my bug count is that or below this.

319
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:14,577
And then as you get further in alpha,

320
00:16:14,757 --> 00:16:15,778
that number shrinks again.

321
00:16:15,798 --> 00:16:17,439
You go to beta, shrinks again.

322
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,500
Halfway through beta, shrinks even more.

323
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,702
So the concept is, is that we can sit there and see like,

324
00:16:22,802 --> 00:16:24,643
okay, who's consistently below their bug count

325
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:25,464
and who's above?

326
00:16:25,804 --> 00:16:27,725
Or maybe somebody's getting overloaded with bugs too much

327
00:16:27,745 --> 00:16:29,346
and we need to have somebody who's got less bugs

328
00:16:29,407 --> 00:16:30,107
help that person.

329
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:31,928
And you also can track your game as a whole

330
00:16:31,988 --> 00:16:34,150
to make sure that are we going to finish this thing on time.

331
00:16:35,182 --> 00:16:38,023
In fact, here's a little bit of data that might be interesting.

332
00:16:38,803 --> 00:16:43,724
The chart on the left is an actual snippet of what the bug graph would look like from

333
00:16:43,784 --> 00:16:46,585
our bug database that Christoph would send out every day.

334
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:51,227
The blue represents that phase in time, that's your bug limit, and if you're in the red,

335
00:16:51,267 --> 00:16:52,207
that means you're way over.

336
00:16:52,587 --> 00:16:54,248
So obviously Josh sure is having a bad day.

337
00:16:55,111 --> 00:16:58,536
top of the chart. But it also is a sign that he was our cinematics lead. So he was getting

338
00:16:58,836 --> 00:17:02,001
tons of bugs for the entire cinematics team and he had to dole them out.

339
00:17:02,381 --> 00:17:05,806
So maybe it's better if we get one of the guys on the cinematics teams to start fishing through

340
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:10,592
the bugs for him and find his own, or come along and help him take some off of his plate, etc.

341
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:18,866
Now the one on the right is just an interesting side note is we also when we were in Alpha we do we started doing focus testing every

342
00:17:18,906 --> 00:17:24,550
week. We had focus that was coming in playing the game once a week and we have automated data capture of like you know per

343
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:30,114
breakdown of the task. How many times did somebody die. And this was a little spreadsheet we put together is called the attempt

344
00:17:30,154 --> 00:17:30,554
canaries.

345
00:17:31,055 --> 00:17:35,216
So anything that started creeping up above three or more deaths, like either the medium,

346
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:39,478
in the median or the average, then that's something we, as part of the polish process,

347
00:17:39,498 --> 00:17:41,119
we would go back in and try to fix it.

348
00:17:41,399 --> 00:17:45,760
Hence the task, my favorite, RP Jesus, is looking a little tight right there.

349
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,821
So, yeah, can you tighten up the graphics on level RP Jesus, please?

350
00:17:49,522 --> 00:17:51,963
So, anyways, tiered approvals.

351
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:55,464
This is the other, this is another phase, another trick and tip that we do.

352
00:17:56,346 --> 00:18:06,468
And this is kind of what I was going into earlier is like we have a group of key people that are high up that you have to get approvals from at certain points in order to get anything fixed or even polished.

353
00:18:06,989 --> 00:18:11,270
The key people in this case were Evan Wells, co-president, he's our main highest designer in the company.

354
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:16,951
Christoph Balestra, he was the other co-president, highest programmer in the company, and then the game director, Jusmin Richman.

355
00:18:17,371 --> 00:18:22,232
And the nice thing is you want to pick people that have an understanding of the technical and also the quality bar.

356
00:18:23,025 --> 00:18:33,251
that can and they have to be high enough to be able to be decision makers so that way they can sometimes have to duke it out amongst themselves or whether or not does quality take precedence or does the risk take precedence and therefore we don't do it.

357
00:18:34,431 --> 00:18:52,542
And this goes as the often and the alpha beta gold stages happen the approve this is where this kind of goes into play so at the beginning of alpha you're fixing your polishing whatever whatever whatever but halfway through alpha there's going to come a point where it says OK from this point on out if you're going to do a polish pass you have to get one of these people's approval doesn't matter who just have to get one.

358
00:18:53,248 --> 00:18:56,830
And then as it goes on later, like, especially as it approaches beta, now you have to get two.

359
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:01,412
And then once you get near that hands-off phase, that's gold, then you have to go all three.

360
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:03,393
That's where the real fun begins.

361
00:19:03,413 --> 00:19:07,475
You've got to bring in, like, chocolate cake for one guy and a cinnamon bun for this guy.

362
00:19:07,555 --> 00:19:09,316
A little bribery always goes a long way.

363
00:19:09,436 --> 00:19:11,717
But anyways, this system helps to mitigate risk.

364
00:19:11,897 --> 00:19:15,158
Because you're all running around like chickens with your heads cut off, you know.

365
00:19:16,033 --> 00:19:21,996
It's people that are up there high enough in level that they understand the balance of shipping the game, but making it awesome.

366
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:28,499
And they can make sure that the right balance is restored of like, yeah, we can waive that bug, or no, we really should fix that, that looks ugly.

367
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,831
And again, I already said it, make sure you put the right people into approvals.

368
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:36,815
Okay, and the last little note to go over is what I call the all-seeing eye.

369
00:19:37,295 --> 00:19:41,820
So, again, while you're running around like headless chickens, I love that phrase, headless chickens.

370
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,262
Someone make a game about headless chickens, please.

371
00:19:44,322 --> 00:19:45,063
I'll download it right now.

372
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,724
All right, the all-seeing eye is...

373
00:19:47,425 --> 00:19:50,647
Everyone's crazy at the end of the game. We have a high-level person in our case

374
00:19:50,727 --> 00:19:55,451
It was Evan Wells looking for polish daily, so he understands the quality bar

375
00:19:55,471 --> 00:19:58,453
We're trying to hit he understands the the trade-offs that need to be made

376
00:19:58,794 --> 00:20:01,816
But he was the one who's going through make sure nothing slips through the cracks

377
00:20:02,917 --> 00:20:05,218
This person must have a deep understanding of what to look for

378
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:07,300
very important and

379
00:20:07,981 --> 00:20:10,042
It's also important to note. I'm gonna put these two up at the same time

380
00:20:10,686 --> 00:20:11,989
It's not a dictatorship role.

381
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,234
Even though he could, he's the president of the company,

382
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:15,137
he could come at any time and say,

383
00:20:15,157 --> 00:20:17,181
you will fix this right now, like the hand of God.

384
00:20:17,763 --> 00:20:19,326
And what are you gonna do, say no?

385
00:20:19,827 --> 00:20:19,968
Well.

386
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:23,787
he got it was never a dictatorship role he would keep that what a little bit

387
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:25,669
alpha he's going to the game every day

388
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:30,493
constantly looking for problems in that areas that we have video capture inside

389
00:20:30,514 --> 00:20:31,254
of the game where you can

390
00:20:31,835 --> 00:20:34,437
capture setback the videos you've seen so far use a video capture

391
00:20:34,757 --> 00:20:35,698
you grab the segments

392
00:20:35,978 --> 00:20:38,381
should money mail sent to the appropriate people and if they were

393
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:41,083
important up we go get them put on the bug list to make sure that they would

394
00:20:41,103 --> 00:20:41,403
get done

395
00:20:41,843 --> 00:20:47,785
But the point is, you would have to balance fixing those with fixing your bugs and the other polish tests you have.

396
00:20:48,065 --> 00:20:49,005
And it was always a discussion.

397
00:20:49,265 --> 00:20:50,425
You could go to him anytime and say,

398
00:20:50,445 --> 00:20:53,226
I don't know if I'm going to have time to fix this, how important is it?

399
00:20:53,446 --> 00:20:58,527
Or you could say, you find out this is a really difficult fix, it can break a lot of crap, what do you want to do?

400
00:20:58,647 --> 00:21:00,207
And then it's always a discussion with him.

401
00:21:00,227 --> 00:21:02,928
He's like, well, I really would like to see this fix, can we find a compromise?

402
00:21:02,968 --> 00:21:04,708
And you know, you work it out.

403
00:21:04,788 --> 00:21:06,248
He's very approachable.

404
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:11,700
But it is, like I said, a critical role you must have to catch things in the craziness.

405
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,101
Now, these three videos are actually from Evan.

406
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:18,342
I have no polished version of these because I had to dig back through an email, a friend's

407
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:18,922
email to grab these.

408
00:21:19,462 --> 00:21:21,622
And I'll play these more than once because these are a little crazy to see.

409
00:21:21,642 --> 00:21:28,224
Did you catch that?

410
00:21:29,744 --> 00:21:30,324
I'll play it again.

411
00:21:30,524 --> 00:21:32,865
Look, watch Drake as he wigs out right before the water comes.

412
00:21:35,997 --> 00:21:36,737
There.

413
00:21:37,357 --> 00:21:39,219
Like, that crap.

414
00:21:39,819 --> 00:21:41,100
It's like, even, I've been at this company

415
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,241
for, since Uncharted 1, and even when I got

416
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:44,782
into Uncharted 3, I was like, oh yeah,

417
00:21:44,802 --> 00:21:46,243
my level's polished, and I start getting videos,

418
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:49,024
and I'm like, oh, that's right, we do that, I forgot.

419
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,786
So, I mean, it's frickin', yeah, it's crazy.

420
00:21:52,086 --> 00:21:53,347
This is another good one, we call this

421
00:21:53,427 --> 00:21:55,048
the one frame off category of bug.

422
00:21:58,970 --> 00:21:59,410
Did you see it?

423
00:22:00,496 --> 00:22:02,298
Big white flash right there in the middle of the door.

424
00:22:02,338 --> 00:22:05,360
And now this one, it turns out because you're in a pivoted

425
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,103
fixed camera up here, and then you're in another animated

426
00:22:08,143 --> 00:22:10,364
camera in the sequence between the two, what happens is it

427
00:22:10,665 --> 00:22:12,747
was another one frame off bug where the animation, I think,

428
00:22:12,787 --> 00:22:13,767
finished a frame early.

429
00:22:14,228 --> 00:22:16,870
So what happened was the camera said, oh, I'm done here.

430
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,552
And it went all the way back to wherever the hell the player

431
00:22:18,572 --> 00:22:21,534
camera was off in world space for one frame.

432
00:22:21,914 --> 00:22:23,936
And then it came right back for the next animated camera,

433
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:25,738
hence causing that white flash.

434
00:22:25,758 --> 00:22:27,259
Because it could have been a black flash or whatever.

435
00:22:28,286 --> 00:22:32,748
But yeah, that level of craziness and nice little, just give example of a render pop.

436
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:39,433
See the world right there? It happens right near the beginning. Just watch the background, how the light changes.

437
00:22:39,453 --> 00:22:45,036
Boink. That. Like, that's another one of those things. He's like, hey, this looks bad, go fix it.

438
00:22:45,937 --> 00:22:47,018
And I have, I mean...

439
00:22:47,887 --> 00:22:50,368
If this was an hour long talk, I could fill the entire talk up with this.

440
00:22:50,488 --> 00:22:53,828
I mean, we have thousands of these videos of, like, really Evan?

441
00:22:53,868 --> 00:22:54,668
You want us to fix that?

442
00:22:55,008 --> 00:22:59,089
I remember walking over to Travis's desk, and he's walking around in the sand,

443
00:22:59,429 --> 00:23:01,830
and he's trying to show them this little shuffle step that he's doing.

444
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:08,551
And I'm looking at it, and Travis is looking at it going, can you do it again?

445
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:09,671
What are you seeing here?

446
00:23:09,991 --> 00:23:12,551
And it's like, literally, this crazy little minuscule detail.

447
00:23:12,571 --> 00:23:16,532
But all of that helps to add up and make your game that much more solid and tight.

448
00:23:16,932 --> 00:23:17,012
So.

449
00:23:18,428 --> 00:23:21,414
Quick takeaway on all this, wow I'm actually slightly ahead of schedule.

450
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:23,357
That's what nervousness will get you.

451
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,685
Last 10% is the hardest but it gives the highest level of payoff.

452
00:23:28,647 --> 00:23:30,511
You know, and schedule your time for polish.

453
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:49,515
Make sure you put it in the schedule not just put it as part of your production time so like no no we're actually going to whether it's through from beta or you want a dedicated time for polish and you cut your production cycle sort and say no now we're doing nothing but focusing on getting this thing is rock solid as awesome as you can if you want to do the alpha beta thing like we do at least 2025% of your schedules that you want.

454
00:23:50,456 --> 00:23:54,119
I just said that a rolling schedule you can use this to help focus your team.

455
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,155
uh... tiered approval systems to help make sure things they check in the right

456
00:23:58,215 --> 00:23:59,777
balance of what to fix versus what not

457
00:24:00,277 --> 00:24:00,878
taken care of

458
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:03,321
the dedicated overseer as we just went over

459
00:24:04,021 --> 00:24:05,062
and then most importantly

460
00:24:06,063 --> 00:24:09,547
aim for that perfection set that quality bar high don't don't accept the status

461
00:24:09,567 --> 00:24:12,750
quo don't just accept something because it's like that's the games the industry

462
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,571
everyone deals with it

463
00:24:13,851 --> 00:24:14,432
they're players

464
00:24:15,753 --> 00:24:21,876
Silly players, and that's pretty much it. That's me down there and then a quick pimp for our HR person

465
00:24:21,996 --> 00:24:25,998
We are hiring she wanted me to put the slide in if you contact jobs at Naughty Dog calm

466
00:24:26,058 --> 00:24:31,060
Or you can follow Candace Walker on her Twitter. It's at Candace underscore Walker and one more quick note

467
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,282
We have two more naughty dog talks in this very room later today

468
00:24:35,102 --> 00:24:38,744
the art of uncharted it is from our art director Rob Ruppel at noon and

469
00:24:39,304 --> 00:24:44,966
Caitlin Burnell a new hire. She's doing another day design talk at 2 30 in this room, and that's it

470
00:24:50,324 --> 00:24:51,528
And if you want questions, outside.
