1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:11,102
here to see zero to one million, two different studios

2
00:00:11,122 --> 00:00:12,883
with different success and different strategies.

3
00:00:13,504 --> 00:00:14,304
I'm Tanya Short.

4
00:00:15,545 --> 00:00:17,586
And I'm Richard Atlas.

5
00:00:17,606 --> 00:00:19,807
And we're going to do our best to take turns

6
00:00:20,107 --> 00:00:23,248
talking about our studios in a totally natural way.

7
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:26,821
We definitely practiced a lot.

8
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:27,981
We did actually, but.

9
00:00:28,421 --> 00:00:28,901
More than once.

10
00:00:29,081 --> 00:00:31,222
We'll see how it goes.

11
00:00:31,242 --> 00:00:33,122
So you probably know me as the captain

12
00:00:33,182 --> 00:00:34,703
of Kit Fox Games primarily.

13
00:00:35,263 --> 00:00:37,363
We are a studio that started a little while ago.

14
00:00:37,423 --> 00:00:39,984
We were primarily known for Moon Hunters,

15
00:00:40,004 --> 00:00:41,124
which came out a couple of years ago.

16
00:00:41,184 --> 00:00:43,385
We also released Shrouded Isle last year,

17
00:00:43,925 --> 00:00:44,905
Shattered Planet some time ago,

18
00:00:45,085 --> 00:00:47,466
and we've announced Boyfriend Dungeon.

19
00:00:47,486 --> 00:00:47,546
Woo!

20
00:00:47,646 --> 00:00:48,386
Woo!

21
00:00:48,986 --> 00:00:50,106
Yeah.

22
00:00:50,246 --> 00:00:52,607
So we have officially been working together

23
00:00:52,627 --> 00:00:53,647
for about five years now.

24
00:00:54,488 --> 00:01:01,992
and in USD I think we're up to about 2 million total in revenue and we have 5-ish full-time

25
00:01:02,053 --> 00:01:02,373
staff.

26
00:01:02,513 --> 00:01:05,835
Everything's a little bit ish in the indie world, but that's kind of where we are.

27
00:01:07,856 --> 00:01:08,577
And on our end.

28
00:01:11,217 --> 00:01:14,519
So I'm Richard, I'm the CEO, general business person,

29
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,561
take care of some marketing and PR, a little bit of design,

30
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:19,283
a bunch of other stuff at Clever Endeavor.

31
00:01:19,763 --> 00:01:21,344
We have a game called Ultimate Chicken Horse,

32
00:01:21,644 --> 00:01:23,165
which launched a couple of years ago on Steam

33
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:25,987
and launched on PS4 and Xbox in December.

34
00:01:28,853 --> 00:01:34,220
I started working about 2015 and on our side US dollars around 2.5 million in revenue.

35
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,245
We also had a cool cake that was made in ultimate chicken horse style.

36
00:01:39,246 --> 00:01:41,268
And we're also five full-time staff members.

37
00:01:41,328 --> 00:01:44,693
So pretty similar looking studios from the onset.

38
00:01:46,056 --> 00:01:50,958
So I propose this talk partially because I think survivorship bias is rampant in the

39
00:01:51,018 --> 00:01:52,458
business development community.

40
00:01:53,318 --> 00:01:57,680
It often makes us act like our methods are the one true way to do business and if we

41
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,961
succeed that is the correct way to do things.

42
00:02:00,881 --> 00:02:06,383
Some of you are probably here hoping to hear some steps to follow in order to make your

43
00:02:06,523 --> 00:02:09,604
first million dollars and unfortunately that's not going to happen.

44
00:02:10,815 --> 00:02:14,857
This is not a talk about what to do or a formula to apply.

45
00:02:15,497 --> 00:02:17,779
There are lots of different successful strategies.

46
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,900
And although our studios have a lot in common,

47
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,502
we're both commercial indies, we're both based in Montreal,

48
00:02:23,522 --> 00:02:24,743
we're both around the same size,

49
00:02:24,763 --> 00:02:25,803
it started around the same time,

50
00:02:26,504 --> 00:02:29,105
even so we have very fundamentally different ways

51
00:02:29,145 --> 00:02:30,546
of running our studio successfully.

52
00:02:31,126 --> 00:02:33,988
So the point is not to follow either of us.

53
00:02:35,149 --> 00:02:39,092
at all. We're going to walk you through our thought processes so that you can inspect

54
00:02:39,212 --> 00:02:43,435
your strategies and make your own decisions that are best for you. Okay?

55
00:02:45,287 --> 00:02:48,548
So we're going to go through what goals our studios have,

56
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:51,988
how that impacted how we diversified our development

57
00:02:52,068 --> 00:02:55,949
or not, our burn rates, our revenue, and our projections.

58
00:02:55,969 --> 00:02:58,610
We're going to get very deep into the numbers of things

59
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,070
as much as our business partners will allow.

60
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,511
And we'll see what differences and similarities we can find.

61
00:03:08,451 --> 00:03:11,712
So why do our studios exist?

62
00:03:11,772 --> 00:03:12,932
I mean, OK, we want to make games.

63
00:03:13,918 --> 00:03:14,398
apparently.

64
00:03:15,898 --> 00:03:17,339
And what are we trying to achieve?

65
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:20,059
As we put together this talk, we did realize that our goals

66
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:21,240
are very much the same.

67
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,740
We wrote them out separately, but then they actually were

68
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,301
kind of actually the same goals.

69
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:31,282
So when we started looking at these studio overall goals, we

70
00:03:31,322 --> 00:03:32,462
noticed that they're very similar.

71
00:03:32,482 --> 00:03:34,763
So we're going to break them down a little bit and sort of

72
00:03:34,783 --> 00:03:35,223
run through these.

73
00:03:35,903 --> 00:03:39,209
So at Clever Endeavor we want to make sure that our employees are always developing in

74
00:03:39,249 --> 00:03:45,400
terms of their skill and that we feel that they're growing as individuals in their skills

75
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,265
and in their work throughout the work that they're doing with us.

76
00:03:49,305 --> 00:03:54,407
Yeah, I would actually say that improved skills or craftsmanship, as we call it, and personal

77
00:03:54,447 --> 00:03:58,309
growth are really important to Kid Fox, maybe the most important at this point.

78
00:03:58,969 --> 00:04:03,131
We really do want to make some of the best games that exist, and that ambition means

79
00:04:03,151 --> 00:04:05,592
that with each game we have to keep raising the bar a little bit.

80
00:04:06,232 --> 00:04:08,355
We actually didn't discover this goal at first.

81
00:04:08,435 --> 00:04:10,298
We didn't think of it on day one.

82
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:13,022
We kind of realized after we finished Moon Hunters

83
00:04:13,843 --> 00:04:15,305
that we had this ambition, and we

84
00:04:15,365 --> 00:04:16,607
felt we could realize it together.

85
00:04:16,707 --> 00:04:19,551
So now part of what we're going to be talking about

86
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:22,935
are plans to enable this self-improvement and this team

87
00:04:22,995 --> 00:04:23,696
growth together.

88
00:04:25,497 --> 00:04:27,879
And now one of our first goals from the very beginning

89
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,521
was to treat ourselves like professionals,

90
00:04:30,942 --> 00:04:32,383
but also to take care of ourselves.

91
00:04:32,763 --> 00:04:37,006
So we do occasional overtime, but in the past years,

92
00:04:37,187 --> 00:04:38,808
we've never worked on the weekends,

93
00:04:39,448 --> 00:04:41,130
and we've never had sustained overtime.

94
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,772
I personally, as the captain of the ship,

95
00:04:43,852 --> 00:04:45,914
say you're not allowed to work on Kit Fox stuff

96
00:04:45,954 --> 00:04:46,614
after a certain hour.

97
00:04:46,634 --> 00:04:47,695
Feel free to work on your own stuff.

98
00:04:48,635 --> 00:04:55,417
And we work smart pictured here are the original four co-founders of kitfox although Mike is no longer at kitfox

99
00:04:55,457 --> 00:04:58,098
we still miss him and

100
00:04:58,538 --> 00:04:59,539
On our end we're in the same boat

101
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:06,461
we look a little bit different than them, but we also try to avoid overtime and crunch pretty vehemently and

102
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:09,381
We want to be able to work on the things that we want to work on

103
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:14,003
obviously, but that leads to a better quality of life and we want to

104
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:17,861
take careful attention to make sure that our employees and the partners themselves,

105
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:20,042
our lives come first before our work.

106
00:05:20,222 --> 00:05:22,363
So if there are issues, if there's whatever things come up,

107
00:05:23,283 --> 00:05:26,064
we know that the priority is on our lives and our stress

108
00:05:26,104 --> 00:05:28,825
and our situation before our work directly.

109
00:05:30,647 --> 00:05:32,087
The next thing is sustainability.

110
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:33,408
Of course, we want to survive.

111
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:36,469
So our goal as a company is to become

112
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:38,250
a long-term sustainable company

113
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,491
that can survive for many years,

114
00:05:39,751 --> 00:05:40,832
pay competitive salaries.

115
00:05:41,552 --> 00:05:42,792
Like we talked about, skill development,

116
00:05:43,073 --> 00:05:44,533
have our employees develop their skills.

117
00:05:45,294 --> 00:05:47,675
We never really had the goal of growing a company

118
00:05:47,695 --> 00:05:50,496
to become huge and flipping it, selling it,

119
00:05:50,556 --> 00:05:51,437
and then starting something new.

120
00:05:51,457 --> 00:05:52,797
That's not really the way we see it.

121
00:05:53,177 --> 00:05:56,199
It's more of a long-term, slow, steady rise.

122
00:05:57,059 --> 00:05:57,960
Yeah, it was the same for us.

123
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,701
We put survival as a number one priority.

124
00:06:00,781 --> 00:06:03,343
I wanted Kit Fox to exist in five or 10 years,

125
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,384
and now it's been five years, so goal one achieved.

126
00:06:06,465 --> 00:06:08,026
And so in many ways, this did translate

127
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:11,588
into safer, less risky, more conservative business

128
00:06:11,688 --> 00:06:12,748
development practices.

129
00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:16,150
The primary of which is actually that we

130
00:06:16,231 --> 00:06:19,372
felt diversifying our studio into developing

131
00:06:19,432 --> 00:06:20,873
multiple different kinds of products

132
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,615
was what was best for us and our goals.

133
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:30,737
So this decision of whether or not to diversify into multiple products or to develop just one game at a time

134
00:06:31,477 --> 00:06:36,438
Does impact everything else it determines what your studio is good at?

135
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:43,320
How it grows over time it's a cyclical thing or as soon as you start either diversifying or focusing on one game

136
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,041
Your personnel changes your strategy for dealing with crises changes

137
00:06:48,822 --> 00:06:51,163
And of course you can change your goals midway.

138
00:06:52,023 --> 00:06:54,324
You can start to diversify after developing only one game.

139
00:06:54,344 --> 00:06:57,025
You can start to focus after deciding

140
00:06:57,065 --> 00:06:58,286
that diversifying was bad for you.

141
00:06:59,226 --> 00:07:03,068
But the way that you develop even your first project

142
00:07:03,988 --> 00:07:06,729
could change depending on how you want to orient

143
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,930
your studio and its strengths.

144
00:07:11,143 --> 00:07:16,086
The short answer is that Kit Fox is very diversified oriented.

145
00:07:16,826 --> 00:07:19,547
Some successful studios diversify, such as Clay.

146
00:07:20,548 --> 00:07:22,649
Clay is one of my favorite game studios.

147
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:24,089
And honestly, a lot of the advice

148
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,270
I'm going to give you today is actually advice

149
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:29,052
that Jamie Chang of Clay gave me back in 2013.

150
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:31,593
And I immediately started trying to act on.

151
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:34,694
Lots of game studios are happy to bet it all

152
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:37,056
on one big release, especially they have.

153
00:07:38,196 --> 00:07:38,936
Nothing to lose.

154
00:07:39,557 --> 00:07:42,779
You're making your first game, why not make it your big only thing?

155
00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:47,901
But I preferred, again, to bet on survival and calculate our risks and

156
00:07:47,921 --> 00:07:48,762
take the safer bet.

157
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,503
So when we were in the middle of developing Shattered Planet,

158
00:07:51,523 --> 00:07:57,286
I saw an announcement online that the Square Enix collective was going to exist.

159
00:07:58,448 --> 00:08:01,210
And there was no call for pitches or anything like that.

160
00:08:01,571 --> 00:08:04,173
I just cold emailed Square Enix saying,

161
00:08:04,213 --> 00:08:06,796
can I please pitch something to your weird new thing?

162
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:08,057
And they said, I guess.

163
00:08:08,097 --> 00:08:10,099
I don't know who you are, but OK.

164
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,241
You have to get it in by Friday, though.

165
00:08:13,262 --> 00:08:15,484
So we hadn't even soft launched.

166
00:08:16,145 --> 00:08:17,867
our first game yet, Shattered Planet.

167
00:08:17,887 --> 00:08:20,990
We had four people, and when I told the team,

168
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,052
I was like, no, no, no, let's stop for two days,

169
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,534
make a pitch document, and send it to these randos.

170
00:08:25,935 --> 00:08:27,516
They were like, what are you doing?

171
00:08:27,797 --> 00:08:30,079
We're behind schedule, we have assets to make.

172
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,043
And our business partners also, our investors,

173
00:08:34,643 --> 00:08:37,366
said maybe you should be focusing a little bit more, Tanya.

174
00:08:37,386 --> 00:08:38,727
This is a recurring theme with me.

175
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:44,034
It worked out. We actually pitched the Moon Hunters, which was our next game,

176
00:08:44,134 --> 00:08:46,016
and it was actually a really great opportunity for us.

177
00:08:46,076 --> 00:08:49,640
And we had no way of knowing that at the time, but we decided it was worth risking two days

178
00:08:50,141 --> 00:08:54,206
to explore this new opportunity for diversification, because I had already known

179
00:08:54,226 --> 00:08:58,411
that I wanted to be developing multiple projects in parallel as much as possible.

180
00:08:59,252 --> 00:09:01,813
So over time, Kid Fox has become maximally diversified,

181
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,794
like maybe way too diversified, actually.

182
00:09:04,455 --> 00:09:06,596
In five years, we've released three major projects

183
00:09:06,776 --> 00:09:08,217
and we spent a year on work for hire.

184
00:09:09,497 --> 00:09:11,298
And 2018 marks our very first time

185
00:09:11,578 --> 00:09:14,300
with two games solidly in production together,

186
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,461
even though I was just here on Monday

187
00:09:17,862 --> 00:09:19,302
talking about how Moon Hunters

188
00:09:19,342 --> 00:09:20,843
had initially disappointing sales.

189
00:09:21,985 --> 00:09:26,471
So there's good and bad sides of diversifying and developing

190
00:09:26,511 --> 00:09:28,473
multiple games at once.

191
00:09:28,974 --> 00:09:31,717
I mean, sure, yeah, it's lower risk, obviously.

192
00:09:32,418 --> 00:09:35,883
If one project does well, we can split it up

193
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:37,304
into multiple other things.

194
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:39,828
And if no single failure can close the studio.

195
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,450
And because we're having multiple little revenue streams,

196
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,111
things are generally more stable.

197
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:49,153
We don't need to rely on one individual sale.

198
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:52,874
Of course, it's still a little spiky because Steam,

199
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:56,656
but more games equals a stronger back catalog

200
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,458
and steadier flow, and I sleep better at night.

201
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:03,255
And our team members are quite flexible now

202
00:10:03,295 --> 00:10:05,096
because they've worked on lots of different projects together

203
00:10:05,236 --> 00:10:07,077
in lots of different configurations.

204
00:10:08,017 --> 00:10:10,798
Hybrid team members stay more excited and refreshed

205
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,359
because they're not working the same thing

206
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,279
for years and years and years.

207
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,700
And so people are less likely, I think,

208
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,541
to feel cynical or bitter on a project

209
00:10:18,581 --> 00:10:20,062
because they know they have other options.

210
00:10:20,282 --> 00:10:23,123
And if there isn't one right now, there probably will be soon.

211
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,504
So we can adjust to change

212
00:10:25,564 --> 00:10:27,565
according to team members' interests pretty quickly.

213
00:10:28,813 --> 00:10:30,074
And with a large number of projects,

214
00:10:30,134 --> 00:10:32,757
we can experience a very junior team member

215
00:10:32,777 --> 00:10:34,619
can join in straight from school

216
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,761
and experience from pre-production

217
00:10:36,821 --> 00:10:38,944
all the way to shipping very quickly

218
00:10:39,144 --> 00:10:41,426
because they can see the whole life cycle

219
00:10:41,627 --> 00:10:43,228
of a project happening right next to them.

220
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:45,491
So there's a lot of different opportunities

221
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:46,071
from start to finish.

222
00:10:46,592 --> 00:10:50,833
Unfortunately, hybrid team members are also not particularly specialists.

223
00:10:50,873 --> 00:10:52,533
I mean, this is no new problem in indie.

224
00:10:52,593 --> 00:10:54,613
We're all kind of wearing a lot of hats.

225
00:10:55,654 --> 00:11:00,575
But this is another thing altogether when you are doing something

226
00:11:00,595 --> 00:11:03,495
completely different on a different kind of project every year or so.

227
00:11:03,515 --> 00:11:06,056
I mean, at this point, we have specialized a little bit

228
00:11:06,076 --> 00:11:08,517
into system-driven RPGs, I guess.

229
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:11,857
But the art styles are all over the place,

230
00:11:11,917 --> 00:11:13,318
the technology is all over the place.

231
00:11:13,538 --> 00:11:15,698
So you can't say, like, we have the world's best.

232
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:19,841
person at anything. They're the best at making that one game that one time.

233
00:11:21,503 --> 00:11:29,129
And we also start projects constantly. Thankfully, I like coming up with new ideas. I don't really

234
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:35,655
mind having blank pages all the time, but it is a little bit stressful to say, oh,

235
00:11:35,675 --> 00:11:38,557
we got to start again every year and a half or so.

236
00:11:39,577 --> 00:11:41,138
But at least it's better than finishing projects.

237
00:11:41,178 --> 00:11:43,498
Finishing projects is the worst.

238
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:47,259
I mean, I don't know how many of you have survived a game.

239
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:48,939
Games are terrible to finish.

240
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,540
And diversification makes that worse

241
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,761
because every time you shut down one crisis,

242
00:11:53,801 --> 00:11:55,301
there's another one coming in the door.

243
00:11:56,701 --> 00:12:00,962
So we do have regular upending of priorities and tasks.

244
00:12:01,462 --> 00:12:04,943
The good news being that we definitely have to prioritize.

245
00:12:06,469 --> 00:12:12,310
well, but as the director, I mean, I still do end up with more difficult decisions per

246
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:12,750
week.

247
00:12:13,871 --> 00:12:19,612
Last fall, we were actually shipping the Shrouded Isle while also hiring up for Boyfriend Dungeon

248
00:12:20,512 --> 00:12:25,653
and shipping Moon Hunters on Switch, and also our tech lead was doing R&D on his own personal

249
00:12:25,693 --> 00:12:28,294
project, so we had like four projects for six people.

250
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,114
Not ideal.

251
00:12:31,595 --> 00:12:34,457
This is what diversification tends to look like for us.

252
00:12:34,717 --> 00:12:40,520
So on the left you have the spend per game and then on the right you have the income

253
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:40,941
per game.

254
00:12:42,601 --> 00:12:44,082
Or maybe it's the other way around.

255
00:12:44,382 --> 00:12:44,763
Which way?

256
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,083
We forgot to label that one.

257
00:12:48,846 --> 00:12:52,709
Yeah, no, it's income on the left and revenue on the right.

258
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:54,430
Yes, because on the left, you see

259
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:58,293
there's a canceled project that we spent on, which oddly enough

260
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,313
did not make us any money.

261
00:13:00,975 --> 00:13:04,257
But yes, so Shrouded Isle is a special case, by the way.

262
00:13:04,777 --> 00:13:07,379
I keep referring to it as if we developed it, but in actuality,

263
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:08,160
we published it.

264
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,621
So we spent almost nothing on development.

265
00:13:10,802 --> 00:13:12,563
It was a side project of one of our members.

266
00:13:12,923 --> 00:13:14,905
But then we also don't get to keep most of the revenue,

267
00:13:15,345 --> 00:13:15,865
unfortunately.

268
00:13:17,058 --> 00:13:18,518
So the other hand, the other side of this

269
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:21,100
are the companies like Supergiant Games,

270
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,600
who focus on one game at a time.

271
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,481
So Supergiant, you might know from Bastion,

272
00:13:24,521 --> 00:13:25,682
then Transistor, and Pyre.

273
00:13:26,442 --> 00:13:28,683
They manage to make amazing games every time,

274
00:13:28,783 --> 00:13:29,623
all the time, somehow.

275
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:32,085
And they're only focusing on one at a time.

276
00:13:33,265 --> 00:13:36,508
In our case, Ultimate Chicken Horse was a game that

277
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:38,590
came out of a game jam originally,

278
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,412
so we kind of fell into this one game that we were starting.

279
00:13:42,233 --> 00:13:43,955
And throughout the process, we'd have to make the decision,

280
00:13:44,015 --> 00:13:45,116
okay, we're working on this,

281
00:13:45,136 --> 00:13:46,437
do we want to start another project,

282
00:13:46,517 --> 00:13:48,058
or do we just full steam ahead?

283
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,381
And we've still been working on Ultimate Chicken Horse.

284
00:13:51,421 --> 00:13:53,823
Like I said, it came out March 2016 on Steam.

285
00:13:54,224 --> 00:13:56,086
We're still on it, and we're still adding stuff to it,

286
00:13:56,226 --> 00:13:58,067
and while we're going to start prototyping new stuff,

287
00:13:58,127 --> 00:13:58,668
hopefully soon.

288
00:14:00,249 --> 00:14:03,394
it's still been the main, well, the only moneymaker,

289
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:06,039
and it's been worth our time to continue it.

290
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:09,143
So with these goals in mind,

291
00:14:09,584 --> 00:14:12,288
or the idea of focusing on one project at a time,

292
00:14:12,489 --> 00:14:14,051
there are, again, some pros and cons.

293
00:14:15,317 --> 00:14:18,580
So one of the positive things that we think that we can try to achieve high

294
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,723
quality by focusing on one thing we don't have to split our mind between

295
00:14:21,743 --> 00:14:25,947
many different things. We know we can focus our design efforts and our feedback

296
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:31,752
on this one game and hopefully the same way Supergiant do it we're going to try

297
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:34,314
and achieve really high quality in each of the games that we're working on.

298
00:14:35,847 --> 00:14:41,252
The next thing is that there's a simplified cash flow, pretty straightforward, less projects to spend money on.

299
00:14:41,773 --> 00:14:48,660
But not only simplified in terms of the sales and in terms of the budgets, but also in terms of if you're going to pitch to people,

300
00:14:49,241 --> 00:14:53,725
choosing which events you're going to, what kind of business development you're doing, that is very much more simplified.

301
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,970
So the decision process is simplified as well as the actual spending.

302
00:14:59,435 --> 00:15:01,036
Project management is a similar thing.

303
00:15:01,977 --> 00:15:03,698
As someone who's helping manage the project,

304
00:15:04,578 --> 00:15:07,080
it's a lot easier to know that all of our employees

305
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,641
and our partners know what everyone is working on

306
00:15:09,661 --> 00:15:11,222
at all times because there's only one thing.

307
00:15:11,642 --> 00:15:13,763
It simplifies the process quite a lot.

308
00:15:13,783 --> 00:15:14,704
So we're all on the same page,

309
00:15:14,764 --> 00:15:16,165
we know what other people on the team need.

310
00:15:16,825 --> 00:15:19,106
We're not gonna bug someone to pull them off a project

311
00:15:19,146 --> 00:15:20,807
for a second because we need some help

312
00:15:20,867 --> 00:15:21,788
last second on this thing.

313
00:15:22,408 --> 00:15:23,289
That simplifies it a lot.

314
00:15:23,849 --> 00:15:24,069
Zing.

315
00:15:25,995 --> 00:15:30,097
Another sort of interesting point, which might be debatable, but I was thinking of this one

316
00:15:30,117 --> 00:15:34,418
when we were writing this, was that I feel like we can meet the expectations better by

317
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:35,299
focusing on one project.

318
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:41,021
What I mean by that is if we were a 30-person team making three projects and spent putting

319
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:46,662
10 people on each of those teams, the expectation is that we are a 30-person AA or III or whatever

320
00:15:46,682 --> 00:15:48,923
you want to call it, those kind of teams, and that we're going to...

321
00:15:49,563 --> 00:15:52,264
produce something that has that kind of quality that kind of Polish well if it's

322
00:15:52,344 --> 00:15:56,365
actually 3 games made by teams of 10 people we're probably not going to hit

323
00:15:56,405 --> 00:16:00,666
that far so I think the expectation can be kept consistent with the size if you

324
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:02,786
well if we're focusing on this one game.

325
00:16:04,386 --> 00:16:08,307
On the other hand, as I was saying the opposite of the the many eggs in many

326
00:16:08,347 --> 00:16:12,108
baskets is that we only have one revenue source right so there's no other

327
00:16:12,408 --> 00:16:15,809
additional revenue streams everything is coming well almost everything as we'll

328
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:17,549
see in a minute is coming from this one game.

329
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:20,201
If it fails, it fails.

330
00:16:20,582 --> 00:16:24,748
You don't have any additional resources to,

331
00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:27,252
well, you're not getting any additional revenue sources.

332
00:16:27,673 --> 00:16:29,596
So we think this can be balanced out

333
00:16:29,616 --> 00:16:30,577
by the high quality argument,

334
00:16:30,737 --> 00:16:32,280
but I guess that's to be seen in the future.

335
00:16:34,276 --> 00:16:35,758
The next thing is after a game launches,

336
00:16:35,798 --> 00:16:37,500
there's a lot of pressure to produce, right?

337
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:40,184
So right when the game launches, you say, okay,

338
00:16:40,204 --> 00:16:41,025
we're on to the next thing.

339
00:16:41,105 --> 00:16:43,088
Well, all of a sudden, you've got X amount of money

340
00:16:43,308 --> 00:16:44,429
and X amount of time to survive,

341
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:45,831
and you have to be creative right away.

342
00:16:46,712 --> 00:16:48,134
Having projects that are dispersed,

343
00:16:48,214 --> 00:16:49,416
more like Kit Fox is doing,

344
00:16:49,736 --> 00:16:51,458
gives a little bit less pressure to produce.

345
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,136
So that's something that can be tough

346
00:16:54,196 --> 00:16:56,136
for the people running the company.

347
00:16:56,156 --> 00:16:57,017
It can be tough for the people

348
00:16:57,037 --> 00:16:58,117
who are forced to be creative.

349
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,737
Like, hey, we need an art style right now.

350
00:16:59,777 --> 00:17:01,278
You have a week to go.

351
00:17:01,338 --> 00:17:02,298
That's not ideal either.

352
00:17:02,678 --> 00:17:06,379
So these are our charts.

353
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,500
They're a little less complicated.

354
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:13,361
So most of our money went to Ultimate Chicken Horse

355
00:17:13,801 --> 00:17:16,341
and most of it came in from Ultimate Chicken Horse.

356
00:17:17,062 --> 00:17:19,042
But just because it's a simplified thing

357
00:17:19,102 --> 00:17:20,302
doesn't mean we shouldn't be careful

358
00:17:20,342 --> 00:17:21,523
about how we spend our money.

359
00:17:22,545 --> 00:17:24,726
So with that I'd like to talk about burn rates.

360
00:17:25,526 --> 00:17:27,587
Burn rates is how much money you spend.

361
00:17:28,507 --> 00:17:29,648
So it's going to be how much money you spend

362
00:17:29,668 --> 00:17:31,509
within a given amount of time.

363
00:17:31,529 --> 00:17:33,590
And that can be a weekly burn, a monthly burn,

364
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,231
yearly, however you want to call it.

365
00:17:35,771 --> 00:17:37,952
Either way, you have to make sure that you're aware

366
00:17:38,032 --> 00:17:39,012
of how much money you're burning

367
00:17:39,172 --> 00:17:40,373
and hopefully not actually burning,

368
00:17:40,553 --> 00:17:42,734
but spending on useful things for game development.

369
00:17:43,554 --> 00:17:44,615
So there are some obvious things

370
00:17:44,755 --> 00:17:46,496
that your burn is going to go towards.

371
00:17:46,676 --> 00:17:50,117
Things like salaries, rent, software,

372
00:17:50,137 --> 00:17:51,898
if you're using game engines, et cetera.

373
00:17:52,603 --> 00:17:54,224
There's the next level that we call,

374
00:17:54,244 --> 00:17:56,865
there are things that are a little bit more under the hood.

375
00:17:56,885 --> 00:17:59,586
So they could be contractors or outsourced work.

376
00:17:59,706 --> 00:18:01,687
That can be things like employee training,

377
00:18:02,007 --> 00:18:03,007
things you probably consider,

378
00:18:03,087 --> 00:18:06,128
but aren't necessarily at the forefront of your mind

379
00:18:06,148 --> 00:18:07,068
when you're thinking of these things.

380
00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:09,409
Beyond that, there's the things

381
00:18:09,649 --> 00:18:10,790
that you really don't want to think about.

382
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,651
And often we fail to realize how important they are.

383
00:18:15,367 --> 00:18:18,770
things like taxes, loan repayment, and royalties, and things like that.

384
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,071
We'll see a little bit later.

385
00:18:20,231 --> 00:18:24,335
It's not ideal when at the end of your quarter or your year,

386
00:18:24,455 --> 00:18:26,877
you find out that you're losing 40% of your money to taxes.

387
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:30,240
So you got to be aware when the money is coming in, of course,

388
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,203
what you're spending it on and what you're going to be spending it on later.

389
00:18:35,937 --> 00:18:39,859
So our theme of Kitfox is scrappy survival.

390
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:43,700
And so we do what we can to save up enough money

391
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,161
during release years to make up for our lean years.

392
00:18:46,681 --> 00:18:50,403
And part of this means that we pay ourselves much less

393
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,704
than we could probably get at a bigger studio.

394
00:18:53,264 --> 00:18:54,525
We all decided that together,

395
00:18:54,665 --> 00:18:56,705
that we were more interested in stability

396
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,906
than in cash out right now,

397
00:18:59,186 --> 00:19:02,168
so that we can invest in projects for longer years to come.

398
00:19:03,428 --> 00:19:07,511
And we try to minimize the numbers of recurring payments

399
00:19:07,571 --> 00:19:09,172
that we're spending on as well,

400
00:19:09,252 --> 00:19:12,594
because that also helps increase the longevity of the studio.

401
00:19:13,154 --> 00:19:16,036
So cut out all those extra subscriptions if possible.

402
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:18,898
I'd rather take the team out to lunch than have a,

403
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:20,339
I don't know, recurring thing, but.

404
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:24,725
I mean unlike a lot of indie studios, probably most,

405
00:19:24,805 --> 00:19:27,707
Kitfox exists because we did find an investor on day one.

406
00:19:28,447 --> 00:19:30,349
None of us had significant savings,

407
00:19:30,449 --> 00:19:34,252
none of us could bootstrap, nobody had much leeway.

408
00:19:35,192 --> 00:19:39,115
One team member, me, I am supported somewhat by my spouse,

409
00:19:40,056 --> 00:19:40,216
but

410
00:19:40,716 --> 00:19:45,923
that was it. All of us had rent to pay, all of us had to find income from somewhere. So

411
00:19:46,423 --> 00:19:50,068
that stability of revenue that I mentioned from diversification

412
00:19:50,108 --> 00:19:53,552
was very important to us and we continue to do that.

413
00:19:54,578 --> 00:19:58,440
So the diversification approach does bite us here a little bit

414
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,461
because burn rates are very complicated for us

415
00:20:00,582 --> 00:20:03,924
to calculate, which makes some business partners nervous.

416
00:20:03,984 --> 00:20:05,665
So I act very confident.

417
00:20:06,485 --> 00:20:07,646
I hope no publishers are watching this.

418
00:20:09,727 --> 00:20:14,210
No, we can't quite to the dollar say exactly how much we're

419
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:17,071
spending on any one thing because someone's

420
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:19,893
spending 40% of their time sort of on this project.

421
00:20:20,173 --> 00:20:23,115
I'm sort of 5% on this project, et cetera.

422
00:20:24,685 --> 00:20:27,348
And we also try to avoid loans where possible

423
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:29,451
because the more we lean on them now,

424
00:20:29,511 --> 00:20:30,372
the more we'll pay later,

425
00:20:30,412 --> 00:20:32,695
but we obviously didn't have a choice early on.

426
00:20:34,137 --> 00:20:36,399
So because stability is more important to us

427
00:20:36,439 --> 00:20:37,280
and continues to be,

428
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:39,844
some loans are worth the peace of mind,

429
00:20:40,725 --> 00:20:43,128
even if it means in the long run, we're going to lose money.

430
00:20:44,434 --> 00:20:47,616
So early on, like this is a couple years ago now,

431
00:20:47,696 --> 00:20:50,558
payroll was so dominant a cost

432
00:20:50,638 --> 00:20:52,760
that nothing really came close at all.

433
00:20:54,021 --> 00:20:56,442
But then, I mean a side effect of shipping things,

434
00:20:57,363 --> 00:20:58,504
that when they sell okay,

435
00:20:58,544 --> 00:21:00,545
you start having to pay those loans back.

436
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:03,587
And pay royalties that you promised.

437
00:21:03,687 --> 00:21:07,110
So the last year hurt a little bit more,

438
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,011
but that was because we were more successful.

439
00:21:10,801 --> 00:21:14,623
And remember that cost chart that I showed you per game?

440
00:21:14,643 --> 00:21:16,744
This is how much we spent per game, right?

441
00:21:17,165 --> 00:21:18,726
Totally, totally sensible.

442
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:20,647
Except that I have no idea how to turn that

443
00:21:20,687 --> 00:21:25,149
into actual spend because a lot of those costs

444
00:21:25,349 --> 00:21:26,990
are across multiple projects.

445
00:21:28,451 --> 00:21:34,517
There's often some back of the napkin things I can do about rent was sort of 60% on this project and sort of not

446
00:21:35,357 --> 00:21:38,060
But at the end of the day, I kind of know what we spent per the year

447
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,663
But it's very hard for me to calculate specific burn rates per project

448
00:21:44,926 --> 00:21:48,689
So the clever never story is a little bit different at least in the way that it started so

449
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,773
the first thing was that we did start pretty much completely unpaid for a year and

450
00:21:53,763 --> 00:21:58,972
There was a Kickstarter in there, but the Kickstarter raised about enough money to pay us,

451
00:21:59,312 --> 00:22:04,241
I don't know, let's say well below minimum wage for about a month out of the year.

452
00:22:04,562 --> 00:22:06,385
So not huge in terms of salaries.

453
00:22:08,492 --> 00:22:10,853
But at that point, actually, I'd sort of counter

454
00:22:10,893 --> 00:22:12,774
to what Tanya was saying, was two of the three

455
00:22:12,794 --> 00:22:14,735
of the partners who started the company were living at home.

456
00:22:15,536 --> 00:22:16,516
We didn't have any expenses.

457
00:22:16,596 --> 00:22:18,437
We don't have any kids, didn't have any kids,

458
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:19,958
no cars, et cetera.

459
00:22:20,018 --> 00:22:22,800
So it was a lot cheaper and we were able to do that

460
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,860
for about a year.

461
00:22:25,601 --> 00:22:27,062
After that, there was investment and so on,

462
00:22:27,102 --> 00:22:28,603
and we'll talk more about that in a little bit.

463
00:22:29,243 --> 00:22:31,745
But on our side, we have a slightly higher burn rate.

464
00:22:32,645 --> 00:22:36,568
We're around 30 to 35 USD, sorry, it's really tiny here,

465
00:22:37,768 --> 00:22:38,088
per month.

466
00:22:38,996 --> 00:22:42,299
And so this has been partially due to the game's success.

467
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:45,482
We've been able to increase salaries.

468
00:22:46,443 --> 00:22:48,785
And so salaries have been good.

469
00:22:48,805 --> 00:22:50,266
We're trying to increase employee salaries

470
00:22:50,326 --> 00:22:52,088
and keep them competitive, of course.

471
00:22:52,108 --> 00:22:56,512
But one of the interesting things that we have admitted

472
00:22:56,592 --> 00:22:59,314
to or are going to be accepting doing

473
00:22:59,695 --> 00:23:01,616
is partner salaries that are variable.

474
00:23:01,676 --> 00:23:03,798
So we understand that if a game's doing well,

475
00:23:04,038 --> 00:23:05,320
then the salaries can go up.

476
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,461
Of course, the employees, you're not going to tell them,

477
00:23:07,501 --> 00:23:09,143
hey, you're earning less this year than you did last year.

478
00:23:09,163 --> 00:23:09,643
That doesn't work.

479
00:23:09,683 --> 00:23:11,825
But the partners are very aware of the fact

480
00:23:11,865 --> 00:23:14,627
that if the next thing doesn't take off,

481
00:23:14,947 --> 00:23:17,309
we're accepting the fact that we might be taking significantly

482
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,951
lower salaries from one year to the next.

483
00:23:23,414 --> 00:23:25,255
So most of the burn comes from salary.

484
00:23:25,635 --> 00:23:28,137
And that's the same thing as we've seen across many studios,

485
00:23:28,898 --> 00:23:30,059
including the two of ours.

486
00:23:33,113 --> 00:23:36,655
And lastly, this is just a point that I figured out

487
00:23:36,675 --> 00:23:39,116
fit into the slide, because it just seems to make sense.

488
00:23:40,477 --> 00:23:42,078
I really want to say not to ignore your own pay.

489
00:23:42,178 --> 00:23:43,999
It sounds almost like the opposite of us

490
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:45,159
not paying ourselves for the first year.

491
00:23:45,879 --> 00:23:47,000
But what I mean by that is that I've

492
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,081
seen a lot of people in the indie dev world,

493
00:23:49,141 --> 00:23:50,962
especially in the startup world in general,

494
00:23:51,402 --> 00:23:54,183
who will spend two years of their lives

495
00:23:54,243 --> 00:23:56,144
working 60 hours a week not paying themselves.

496
00:23:57,545 --> 00:24:00,406
And they don't realize that that's not sustainable.

497
00:24:01,487 --> 00:24:06,511
you really need to pay yourself a certain amount or be able to sustain a kind of lifestyle

498
00:24:07,292 --> 00:24:10,094
where you're going to be earning enough money to survive and not working 60 hours a week

499
00:24:10,174 --> 00:24:10,475
every week.

500
00:24:10,995 --> 00:24:15,159
So I just wanted to make sure to say that we should pay ourselves.

501
00:24:15,618 --> 00:24:17,820
I mean, I think even if you can afford,

502
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,222
let's say you do go two years without paying yourself,

503
00:24:20,763 --> 00:24:22,444
you should be mentally tracking

504
00:24:22,565 --> 00:24:24,666
what would that burn rate have been.

505
00:24:25,287 --> 00:24:27,068
Because if you go around, I've seen this happen,

506
00:24:27,109 --> 00:24:28,550
if you go around saying, oh, you know,

507
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:31,252
I'm 1,000% ROI or whatever,

508
00:24:31,753 --> 00:24:33,154
because you didn't pay your salary,

509
00:24:33,274 --> 00:24:36,977
like that's not actually something usable going forward.

510
00:24:37,197 --> 00:24:39,099
Yeah, the break-even point when you spend no money

511
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:40,500
is not very high, right?

512
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:46,902
So this is a breakdown of our 2016-17 fiscal year

513
00:24:46,922 --> 00:24:48,563
in terms of what we spent.

514
00:24:48,983 --> 00:24:51,864
And so you see that giant big green beast at the bottom,

515
00:24:52,465 --> 00:24:53,205
which is taxes.

516
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:55,346
So I'm putting that in the spend,

517
00:24:55,386 --> 00:24:57,308
this is I guess just money out in general.

518
00:24:57,868 --> 00:24:59,149
That was somewhat of a surprise,

519
00:24:59,169 --> 00:25:01,950
but of course it's a mixed sort of blessing and a curse

520
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:03,151
because if the taxes are high,

521
00:25:03,171 --> 00:25:04,171
it probably means the revenue's high.

522
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,633
So that year we had done well and we're paying more taxes,

523
00:25:06,773 --> 00:25:08,634
but again, you have to keep in mind

524
00:25:08,714 --> 00:25:09,815
that that's a number that you have to pay.

525
00:25:11,195 --> 00:25:14,658
The next thing was there was some royalty repayment,

526
00:25:15,118 --> 00:25:16,739
that's loans and royalties that you see in blue,

527
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,380
that was paid back to investors.

528
00:25:19,201 --> 00:25:20,342
And then the rest of it is payroll.

529
00:25:20,482 --> 00:25:22,023
So if we ignore the big taxes part,

530
00:25:22,043 --> 00:25:23,584
you can see a big chunk of that,

531
00:25:23,624 --> 00:25:27,467
majority of that, the remaining chunk is payroll.

532
00:25:29,675 --> 00:25:32,916
So we also looked at some other studios in Montreal,

533
00:25:33,237 --> 00:25:37,098
and we asked them what percent of their monthly burn

534
00:25:37,138 --> 00:25:37,658
was payroll.

535
00:25:38,198 --> 00:25:39,439
Now, there is a caveat here.

536
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:42,000
We're not entirely sure if they were including things

537
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,680
like loan repayments in their burn.

538
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,801
So these numbers might be a little steep.

539
00:25:45,881 --> 00:25:46,381
Or taxes, even.

540
00:25:46,521 --> 00:25:46,881
Or taxes.

541
00:25:46,961 --> 00:25:48,182
We're not sure.

542
00:25:48,462 --> 00:25:50,002
But across the board, you can see

543
00:25:50,022 --> 00:25:53,584
that the minimum is around 55-ish percent, up to 90%

544
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,144
payroll.

545
00:25:55,244 --> 00:25:58,385
So obviously, that is a big chunk of everyone's spending.

546
00:26:01,974 --> 00:26:04,315
So there are different companies that have different ways

547
00:26:05,735 --> 00:26:07,495
of spending money, and in this case,

548
00:26:07,515 --> 00:26:09,216
we wanna talk about how companies

549
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,196
reinvest in their employees.

550
00:26:11,076 --> 00:26:15,097
So one of the things that some companies do,

551
00:26:15,237 --> 00:26:17,698
like Kitfox, is slow and steady raises,

552
00:26:17,778 --> 00:26:20,678
and they wanna try to basically slowly keep that up

553
00:26:20,878 --> 00:26:22,279
and keep their employees happy

554
00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:24,379
by keeping those raises coming.

555
00:26:25,575 --> 00:26:27,957
There's another company in Montreal called Spearhead Games,

556
00:26:28,037 --> 00:26:30,238
which we got permission to talk about here.

557
00:26:30,898 --> 00:26:32,479
They do a sort of profit sharing.

558
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,539
So once the game has made its money back,

559
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,861
and that means let's say the game costs however much money,

560
00:26:38,321 --> 00:26:41,763
once it makes that back, anything beyond that,

561
00:26:41,923 --> 00:26:43,864
profit, sort of net profit, is split,

562
00:26:44,284 --> 00:26:45,644
10% of that is split among employees.

563
00:26:46,185 --> 00:26:48,546
It doesn't matter seniority, it doesn't matter salary,

564
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:49,646
it doesn't matter any of that.

565
00:26:49,726 --> 00:26:51,687
If you worked on the game, you get a cut of that.

566
00:26:54,408 --> 00:26:56,548
There are some other ideas that we've thrown out here.

567
00:26:56,608 --> 00:26:59,249
So one of the things is game performance leading to bonuses.

568
00:26:59,389 --> 00:27:01,570
The game's doing well, you can give it out in bonuses

569
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,691
without necessarily increasing salaries

570
00:27:03,771 --> 00:27:04,791
because like we said before,

571
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:05,932
those are hard to bring back down.

572
00:27:06,052 --> 00:27:08,533
So you just give bonuses instead if the game's doing well.

573
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:09,993
You're considering something like that.

574
00:27:10,073 --> 00:27:12,374
Yeah, and this is something we've considered as well.

575
00:27:13,352 --> 00:27:18,556
Another idea is to designate some sort of source of revenue as bonus money.

576
00:27:18,877 --> 00:27:23,340
So one idea for that was, let's say you're going on sale for, you know,

577
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,423
Steam had recently the lunar, lunar, what was it called? Lunar New Year sale.

578
00:27:27,644 --> 00:27:28,625
And so you could say, okay,

579
00:27:28,665 --> 00:27:30,626
anything above our baseline that we make during that sale,

580
00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:33,008
that will go as bonus money to employees and partners.

581
00:27:34,449 --> 00:27:40,051
Also, if you're living in a region that happens to have tax credits, you could then designate

582
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:42,132
that money as employee reinvestment money.

583
00:27:42,533 --> 00:27:46,334
Whatever it is that helps you kind of separate it emotionally from the rest of your income

584
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,695
will probably help you see it as employee money.

585
00:27:48,715 --> 00:27:52,657
Yeah, so we're all decently good at spending money.

586
00:27:53,618 --> 00:27:54,698
That's not the hard part.

587
00:27:55,198 --> 00:27:56,619
But how do we make money?

588
00:27:57,566 --> 00:28:00,088
Our money comes from lots of different places, right?

589
00:28:00,849 --> 00:28:02,851
So yeah, we're maximally diversified,

590
00:28:03,011 --> 00:28:05,714
but again, most of our money doesn't actually come

591
00:28:05,754 --> 00:28:07,976
from sales, or it didn't for the first million.

592
00:28:09,257 --> 00:28:10,839
Because we can't handle bootstrapping,

593
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:13,822
we had to go out hunting for other sources of cash.

594
00:28:14,383 --> 00:28:16,386
Our first game, Shattered Planet, there,

595
00:28:17,808 --> 00:28:20,511
did not make back its initial investment for like a year.

596
00:28:21,072 --> 00:28:22,454
So how did we survive?

597
00:28:23,395 --> 00:28:25,318
Well, there's lots of different places you can get money from.

598
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,244
I don't think I've technically done every single one of those,

599
00:28:29,304 --> 00:28:30,666
but almost all of them.

600
00:28:32,527 --> 00:28:34,748
And it's not really much of an exaggeration.

601
00:28:34,908 --> 00:28:38,170
So here are the major ones in chronological order.

602
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:38,950
I can leave that up.

603
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,891
I see a few phones are taking pictures.

604
00:28:40,911 --> 00:28:42,892
But yeah, you should definitely investigate

605
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:45,353
each and every one of those if you're looking

606
00:28:45,413 --> 00:28:47,875
for another few thousand to put in your pocket there.

607
00:28:48,987 --> 00:28:50,747
So first we had Execution Labs.

608
00:28:51,467 --> 00:28:53,488
They were our very first believers.

609
00:28:54,048 --> 00:28:56,049
They invested about 85K USD.

610
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,209
And about nine months later,

611
00:28:58,289 --> 00:28:59,470
we started running out of money.

612
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,630
And so we panicked a little bit

613
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:04,211
and we applied to lots of different places, actually.

614
00:29:04,551 --> 00:29:05,971
And a lot of them paid out.

615
00:29:06,091 --> 00:29:09,192
So we had, technically we had venture capital.

616
00:29:10,032 --> 00:29:11,813
In reality, it was actually kind of

617
00:29:11,873 --> 00:29:13,493
through a government weird program.

618
00:29:13,954 --> 00:29:16,315
But there are startup programs in lots of different places,

619
00:29:16,395 --> 00:29:17,796
like places you wouldn't expect.

620
00:29:18,017 --> 00:29:21,599
So you might actually want to ask your local officials

621
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:24,301
about any kind of entrepreneurial thing,

622
00:29:24,321 --> 00:29:26,823
because everyone wants to be the next San Francisco or whatever.

623
00:29:28,084 --> 00:29:29,025
But we also ran a Kickstart.

624
00:29:29,065 --> 00:29:29,365
Sorry.

625
00:29:29,505 --> 00:29:30,406
Sorry, San Francisco.

626
00:29:32,347 --> 00:29:35,389
So Kickstarter also gave us a little bit, which was great.

627
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,831
We also did a very small contract with Cartoon Network

628
00:29:37,851 --> 00:29:38,712
during this time.

629
00:29:39,873 --> 00:29:42,395
But around that time, we, oops, nope.

630
00:29:43,624 --> 00:29:45,786
We also started doing some work for hire.

631
00:29:45,806 --> 00:29:49,230
Something I mentioned on Monday was that

632
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,973
Moonhunter's initial sales were not great

633
00:29:52,093 --> 00:29:54,175
and I was worried that they would be zero.

634
00:29:54,715 --> 00:29:56,057
So in preparation for that,

635
00:29:56,097 --> 00:29:57,679
I actually set up a contract for work for hire.

636
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,821
although that didn't end up really going anywhere,

637
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,822
it was still helpful for us to keep going

638
00:30:04,042 --> 00:30:07,463
and surviving through to help moon hunters get nourished.

639
00:30:07,944 --> 00:30:09,144
And I'm calling it loans here.

640
00:30:09,444 --> 00:30:11,185
The Canada Media Fund, although it sounds

641
00:30:11,205 --> 00:30:13,786
like a grant organization, is actually a loan organization.

642
00:30:13,826 --> 00:30:15,306
So it is a very favorable loan,

643
00:30:16,267 --> 00:30:18,208
but theoretically we could have also gotten

644
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:20,509
that kind of loan from a bank or something like that

645
00:30:20,849 --> 00:30:23,310
at much worse terms, but that is also a source

646
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,750
that we could have looked at.

647
00:30:25,678 --> 00:30:28,222
uh... so our sales are mostly from steam

648
00:30:29,003 --> 00:30:32,688
our sales are very steam focused but consoles aren't doing bad either

649
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:37,676
we've got almost nothing from mobile uh... that was even back in two thousand

650
00:30:37,997 --> 00:30:40,541
fourteen so i imagine it would be worse now

651
00:30:41,161 --> 00:30:48,807
We are focused on premium games, and I do think that in an ideal world, we would do more direct sales by kitfoxgames.com.

652
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:57,053
There's a really great blog article recently from Jason Rohrer about how he's doing really well selling his games on his website in 2018,

653
00:30:57,213 --> 00:31:05,439
so that's definitely worth checking out because Steam does add value, I think, and they earn their 30%, but being able to get my own 30% would also be nice.

654
00:31:08,154 --> 00:31:09,694
So here we go again.

655
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:11,835
Remember this simple, clean chart?

656
00:31:13,295 --> 00:31:15,495
Well, those sales are only half the equation.

657
00:31:16,396 --> 00:31:20,056
So in reality, although everyone only asks about sales,

658
00:31:20,096 --> 00:31:21,677
everyone only talks about sales,

659
00:31:22,337 --> 00:31:25,137
in reality, the survival of a studio like Kit Fox

660
00:31:25,237 --> 00:31:27,498
is only possible through having lots

661
00:31:27,538 --> 00:31:28,878
of different sources of revenue

662
00:31:29,338 --> 00:31:32,999
and being able to put aside my pride for a little bit

663
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:35,179
and be willing to pay some interest in a few years.

664
00:31:37,561 --> 00:31:40,423
We still have years without as much income as other years.

665
00:31:40,483 --> 00:31:42,405
We're still a little bit spiky because that's

666
00:31:42,445 --> 00:31:43,946
how premium game launches work.

667
00:31:45,067 --> 00:31:47,289
But unless we're willing to transition

668
00:31:47,349 --> 00:31:49,651
into games as a service, which I don't know, it could happen.

669
00:31:50,231 --> 00:31:51,573
But this seems kind of unavoidable for now,

670
00:31:51,613 --> 00:31:53,554
but we're making the best of it that we can.

671
00:31:55,396 --> 00:31:58,098
So from Clever Endeavor's side, Ultimate Chicken Rice,

672
00:31:58,118 --> 00:32:00,820
like we said, has been the only real revenue source

673
00:32:01,521 --> 00:32:03,663
except for a small investment, which we

674
00:32:03,683 --> 00:32:04,663
got before the game launched.

675
00:32:05,497 --> 00:32:07,781
So we're going to talk about that in a second.

676
00:32:08,361 --> 00:32:12,207
The first million dollars and overall game sales, of course,

677
00:32:12,247 --> 00:32:14,150
have been the major source of revenue for us.

678
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,927
So if we look at overall, this is

679
00:32:18,067 --> 00:32:19,568
going to be the all-time revenue sources,

680
00:32:19,588 --> 00:32:22,149
and then I'll show you one with just the first million.

681
00:32:22,569 --> 00:32:24,710
So we see PC sales is really high.

682
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,971
Console sales are there, but we've only

683
00:32:27,991 --> 00:32:29,712
been out on console for about two, three months.

684
00:32:29,892 --> 00:32:32,593
So hopefully that red piece will start getting bigger.

685
00:32:33,474 --> 00:32:34,994
And there was a small investment that you

686
00:32:35,034 --> 00:32:37,175
see there as well, along with the Kickstarter.

687
00:32:39,056 --> 00:32:42,337
So on the PC sales side, most of our income comes from Steam.

688
00:32:42,517 --> 00:32:42,918
About 91% of our.

689
00:32:45,526 --> 00:32:47,086
around 91% of it is from steam.

690
00:32:47,987 --> 00:32:50,088
The next highest contributor is going to be Humble Bundle,

691
00:32:50,208 --> 00:32:51,729
which included two Humble Bundles,

692
00:32:51,889 --> 00:32:54,910
as well as just being on the Humble store itself,

693
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,611
which I believe is on this part.

694
00:32:58,532 --> 00:33:00,833
So our PC console focused so far,

695
00:33:01,414 --> 00:33:03,495
that's what Ultimate Chicken Norse has been launched on.

696
00:33:04,135 --> 00:33:06,256
And we sort of plan to stay that way,

697
00:33:06,416 --> 00:33:08,137
but we're not really sure.

698
00:33:08,717 --> 00:33:10,398
Right now we haven't had any interest in mobile

699
00:33:10,438 --> 00:33:11,158
because none of the.

700
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,580
people on the team are really mobile gamers.

701
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,201
But obviously we're not going to close any doors.

702
00:33:16,281 --> 00:33:17,601
So we'll see what happens.

703
00:33:19,142 --> 00:33:19,402
We're not...

704
00:33:20,482 --> 00:33:21,943
Yeah, actually, let's not get into that.

705
00:33:22,243 --> 00:33:24,784
I had a note about mobile, but yeah.

706
00:33:25,464 --> 00:33:26,784
So the other thing I wanted to note is

707
00:33:27,264 --> 00:33:29,005
we're not on a lot of the small stores.

708
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:30,326
So we have the Humble store

709
00:33:30,446 --> 00:33:33,006
because they helped us set up a cool four-pack deal

710
00:33:33,927 --> 00:33:34,767
and we're on Steam.

711
00:33:35,307 --> 00:33:39,870
But we're not on a bunch of little stores because we take the contracts that we sign very...

712
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,731
We scrutinize them quite closely.

713
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:46,293
And we've seen a lot of really, really, really, really awful contracts.

714
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:49,775
And I think the amount of money and time we would spend just sorting that out

715
00:33:49,895 --> 00:33:52,997
is probably more than the sum of all that we would make on all of those small stores.

716
00:33:53,517 --> 00:33:55,638
So we're going to leave that out for now.

717
00:33:57,139 --> 00:33:59,080
If we look at the first million...

718
00:33:59,951 --> 00:34:04,593
this is again a little bit simpler than than what could Fox games has you can

719
00:34:04,633 --> 00:34:08,074
see investment is a small chunk and the rest of it is simply game sales.

720
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:14,136
So again like with the burn rates we talk to some different Montreal studios

721
00:34:14,256 --> 00:34:18,278
about how much money or where their first million came from and we had a

722
00:34:18,358 --> 00:34:23,299
pretty wide variety of of revenue sources in this first million so the

723
00:34:23,319 --> 00:34:25,980
first 3 that you see on the top are just sales.

724
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:31,611
The next one, the purple and the blue, is 75% Kickstarter and 25% sales.

725
00:34:31,671 --> 00:34:37,359
And then there's one on the bottom that's a mix of work for hire, government funding,

726
00:34:38,641 --> 00:34:40,083
and I think there's something else in there.

727
00:34:41,323 --> 00:34:44,666
And then the last one, interestingly, was all from a publisher.

728
00:34:44,866 --> 00:34:50,071
So this was an advance on sales that they made the first million on that, and I don't

729
00:34:50,091 --> 00:34:51,393
know how much they might have made after that.

730
00:34:51,473 --> 00:34:55,537
But the point is, the revenue sources obviously can be quite different in the first million

731
00:34:55,557 --> 00:34:57,859
dollars that you're making, or in the first $100,000 that you're making.

732
00:34:58,917 --> 00:35:01,918
So I mean, obviously, this probably isn't a representative

733
00:35:01,938 --> 00:35:03,839
sample of the entire indie community.

734
00:35:03,919 --> 00:35:07,260
But I think it's interesting that in a city as indie

735
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:10,962
healthy as Montreal, you still see that only about half

736
00:35:11,002 --> 00:35:13,963
of the companies who are still around,

737
00:35:13,983 --> 00:35:17,604
it looks like who answered my email,

738
00:35:17,744 --> 00:35:20,346
were initially bootstrapped, apparently,

739
00:35:20,426 --> 00:35:22,366
because they didn't get any money from anywhere but sales.

740
00:35:25,073 --> 00:35:27,314
So the next thing I want to talk about is projections.

741
00:35:27,974 --> 00:35:30,255
I think you should do projections.

742
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:34,237
So we talk a lot about the cash flow,

743
00:35:34,277 --> 00:35:35,137
the money that's coming in,

744
00:35:35,457 --> 00:35:38,559
and cash flow in terms of revenue sources,

745
00:35:38,859 --> 00:35:40,740
also in terms of burn rates, how much is going out.

746
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,061
So we try to look at the runway that we have,

747
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:46,122
which is basically how much time we have to survive

748
00:35:46,442 --> 00:35:47,423
based on the money that we make.

749
00:35:48,415 --> 00:35:51,436
It's fairly simple, it's the revenue minus the burn.

750
00:35:52,196 --> 00:35:54,217
And this way you'll be able to see how many years

751
00:35:54,317 --> 00:35:57,918
or months you can survive in your current situation.

752
00:35:58,978 --> 00:36:00,819
There's a few things we want to point out about this

753
00:36:00,979 --> 00:36:02,239
before we get too deep into it.

754
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:04,740
So the first one is to know your limit.

755
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,740
Obviously you can't project accurately

756
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,021
five years down the line.

757
00:36:08,061 --> 00:36:10,422
So if you're spending hours calculating pennies

758
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:12,182
five years down the line, that's probably silly

759
00:36:12,242 --> 00:36:13,322
because we can't do that.

760
00:36:15,307 --> 00:36:18,768
The next thing is to always add contingency and to estimate high.

761
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:20,828
So every time I make budgets for anything,

762
00:36:21,168 --> 00:36:23,809
I always make them quite a bit higher than I expect.

763
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:25,469
And I can tell you from experience,

764
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:29,091
you'll be happier when you're $1,000 under budget as opposed

765
00:36:29,131 --> 00:36:30,311
to $100 over budget.

766
00:36:30,491 --> 00:36:32,772
So the accuracy might be less, but you'll

767
00:36:32,792 --> 00:36:35,432
be happier if you didn't go over the budget, even by a bit.

768
00:36:36,493 --> 00:36:38,393
Also, it's nice to find you have extra money based

769
00:36:38,433 --> 00:36:39,173
on the budget that you've made.

770
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:43,021
The next point is somewhat obvious.

771
00:36:44,022 --> 00:36:45,223
Every situation must be considered,

772
00:36:45,243 --> 00:36:48,125
but I want to point out the way in which we look at

773
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:51,348
every single situation or try to think of every situation

774
00:36:51,608 --> 00:36:54,611
is to look at it from, so my perspective is

775
00:36:54,691 --> 00:36:56,472
the business marketing PR perspective,

776
00:36:56,552 --> 00:36:58,514
but also try to think of it as,

777
00:36:58,534 --> 00:37:00,195
okay, well if I'm the lead artist,

778
00:37:00,235 --> 00:37:01,376
maybe there's gonna be software I need,

779
00:37:01,396 --> 00:37:02,037
maybe there's gonna be.

780
00:37:02,857 --> 00:37:06,039
things that are going to come up, maybe we're going to want to hire people, what does this company do?

781
00:37:06,179 --> 00:37:10,440
They must have had to consider what was happening when they did this promotion, or this, or this, or this.

782
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:14,462
So really trying to think of everything from your perspective,

783
00:37:14,502 --> 00:37:17,163
but also from the perspective of other people in your milieu,

784
00:37:17,883 --> 00:37:22,785
will help you to get a good handle on how much money you're going to be spending,

785
00:37:22,805 --> 00:37:23,946
and how much money you're going to be earning.

786
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:28,279
Yeah, so I find money really scary.

787
00:37:30,202 --> 00:37:32,164
I come from humble origins,

788
00:37:32,545 --> 00:37:35,088
and the idea of the number of dollars

789
00:37:35,428 --> 00:37:37,932
that we spend per month is literally terrifying.

790
00:37:37,952 --> 00:37:40,515
And it can be really emotional at first.

791
00:37:41,256 --> 00:37:43,777
But I also very much believe in projections,

792
00:37:44,017 --> 00:37:47,819
and we do a very basic calculation every six months or so.

793
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,561
It is definitely completely worth it.

794
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:52,682
So here's some example numbers.

795
00:37:52,722 --> 00:37:54,162
They're a little bit fudged,

796
00:37:54,283 --> 00:37:56,864
but it gives an idea of how we calculate.

797
00:37:56,924 --> 00:38:00,086
So as a small team, our variance from month to month

798
00:38:00,186 --> 00:38:02,947
can be very high, because although salary is the.

799
00:38:03,307 --> 00:38:04,808
the majority of our spend.

800
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,008
We still, you know, when PAX comes in

801
00:38:07,068 --> 00:38:09,989
and blows our budget by an extra $10,000, that's a lot.

802
00:38:10,049 --> 00:38:12,010
That's like, you know, half of our usual burn.

803
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:16,051
So between travel costs, like in 2016,

804
00:38:16,471 --> 00:38:19,231
our month-to-month costs varied by up to 50%.

805
00:38:19,651 --> 00:38:21,112
So we couldn't just take a random month

806
00:38:21,152 --> 00:38:22,472
and then multiply it by 12.

807
00:38:22,572 --> 00:38:23,833
That absolutely wouldn't work.

808
00:38:24,013 --> 00:38:25,493
We have to actually see what the average is

809
00:38:25,533 --> 00:38:26,733
and what the variance is, both.

810
00:38:27,634 --> 00:38:33,781
So 15% is what I've heard tossed around as an average contingency plan or in the budget

811
00:38:33,821 --> 00:38:34,562
for projects.

812
00:38:35,283 --> 00:38:40,229
But even last year, in our fourth year of existing, Kitfox still had a variance from

813
00:38:40,269 --> 00:38:45,615
month to month of 34%, which is still high, but maybe it'll slow down a little bit over

814
00:38:45,655 --> 00:38:45,835
time.

815
00:38:46,816 --> 00:38:50,178
So if we hire two more people this year, which is the plan,

816
00:38:50,958 --> 00:38:52,439
that does increase the monthly burn

817
00:38:52,479 --> 00:38:55,081
by a certain amount per month, right?

818
00:38:55,621 --> 00:38:56,621
And then you multiply that by 12,

819
00:38:57,222 --> 00:39:00,363
and you have an idea of what you might be spending in 2018.

820
00:39:01,444 --> 00:39:03,485
And then if I see how much money we have left in the bank

821
00:39:03,865 --> 00:39:06,206
and pessimistically add how much we'll get this year,

822
00:39:06,627 --> 00:39:09,208
again, very, very rounded numbers, but you get the idea,

823
00:39:09,228 --> 00:39:11,709
and divide how much we spend per month,

824
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:13,430
it looks kind of like this.

825
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:17,772
So it's like, oh, we kind of have enough for about a year.

826
00:39:17,932 --> 00:39:19,492
And in six months, I can calculate that again

827
00:39:19,532 --> 00:39:20,633
and see if that's actually true.

828
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:24,394
And I know this is a little bit crazy.

829
00:39:24,914 --> 00:39:26,275
Actual business people are probably like,

830
00:39:26,355 --> 00:39:27,255
what are you doing, Tanya?

831
00:39:27,675 --> 00:39:30,016
But I do actually put in our burn

832
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,577
as if it was at its highest, like continuously.

833
00:39:32,717 --> 00:39:35,638
And also, what if suddenly steam crashed tomorrow

834
00:39:35,738 --> 00:39:37,979
and didn't give us any money, or there was a legal problem?

835
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:38,560
I don't know.

836
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,941
But I still am seeing in the very worst case,

837
00:39:42,521 --> 00:39:43,801
Can we survive six months?

838
00:39:44,001 --> 00:39:46,822
Yes or no, because I feel like we absolutely have to.

839
00:39:47,443 --> 00:39:49,563
And if that ever becomes a no, we're

840
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:51,424
not really sure if we're going to survive for six months.

841
00:39:51,944 --> 00:39:54,065
Then I'm suddenly no longer a game designer.

842
00:39:54,765 --> 00:39:57,566
I am now a business developer full time.

843
00:39:58,566 --> 00:40:00,147
And I don't like that, so I try to avoid it.

844
00:40:00,407 --> 00:40:00,907
And this is how.

845
00:40:02,261 --> 00:40:05,044
and so yeah we check in on that that's that every six months

846
00:40:05,885 --> 00:40:07,787
and because we're spending conservatively

847
00:40:07,807 --> 00:40:09,009
and we can also

848
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:14,315
have a moment where the whole team takes the day and they guess how

849
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:17,820
much will we sell before we launch. Now of course nobody has an idea. Nobody knows

850
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,863
how much their game is going to sell before they launch and anyone who tells you otherwise is lying.

851
00:40:21,344 --> 00:40:26,570
But having your employees actually go through the mental exercise of how many

852
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:31,076
would I think it would sell is interesting because it is kind of like a

853
00:40:31,136 --> 00:40:34,860
cross-disciplinary learning moment because people don't even realize what

854
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,223
assumptions they're making, what expectations they have until they put

855
00:40:37,243 --> 00:40:39,786
them on paper and look at what other people's expectations are. It can be

856
00:40:39,866 --> 00:40:40,527
really wild.

857
00:40:41,447 --> 00:40:43,188
So this is the kind of thing that I do with the team.

858
00:40:43,248 --> 00:40:45,829
I tell them these are some example sales.

859
00:40:45,849 --> 00:40:48,290
These are not actual sales, these are my guesstimates

860
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:51,891
based on, by the way, Steam reviews times 12

861
00:40:52,551 --> 00:40:53,531
at a certain point in time.

862
00:40:54,312 --> 00:40:57,493
I don't have any secret source for sales numbers, I'm sorry.

863
00:40:57,513 --> 00:40:59,734
I actually think that multiplying Steam reviews

864
00:40:59,774 --> 00:41:02,414
is a better source for this kind of thing than Steamspy.

865
00:41:02,534 --> 00:41:04,015
Steamspy is wonderful and amazing,

866
00:41:04,935 --> 00:41:07,236
but I don't use them for sales estimates at all

867
00:41:07,296 --> 00:41:08,436
because of bundles and stuff.

868
00:41:09,177 --> 00:41:11,417
So anyway, I give the team this kind of thing,

869
00:41:11,477 --> 00:41:14,558
like here's some comparable games and their sales over time.

870
00:41:14,958 --> 00:41:16,678
So what do you think it'll sell in a month

871
00:41:16,798 --> 00:41:17,658
compared to these things?

872
00:41:18,539 --> 00:41:21,799
Of course, the scary thing is that employees stop here.

873
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,100
They don't really need to know the rest of it.

874
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,740
They don't need to know the financials.

875
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,120
I mean, if they want to, I don't mind.

876
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,081
I'm a transparent kind of business owner,

877
00:41:28,141 --> 00:41:31,161
but most people are stressed out like I am

878
00:41:31,241 --> 00:41:33,822
when they see lots of zeros and things everywhere

879
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:35,162
going out of their bank account.

880
00:41:36,284 --> 00:41:38,046
So for them, all they need to do is say,

881
00:41:38,086 --> 00:41:40,050
oh, I think it'll be about 5,000 in three months.

882
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:40,951
That sounds reasonable.

883
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,074
Of course, in real life,

884
00:41:43,475 --> 00:41:45,358
sales are very rarely in the middle.

885
00:41:47,102 --> 00:41:49,383
and that's a whole other lecture for a whole other time.

886
00:41:49,963 --> 00:41:52,385
But I generally, I like to sense,

887
00:41:52,825 --> 00:41:54,766
are my employees feeling very pessimistic

888
00:41:54,806 --> 00:41:55,826
about the sales coming up?

889
00:41:55,886 --> 00:41:57,507
Are they feeling optimistic?

890
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,969
What do they think it will perform like and why?

891
00:41:59,989 --> 00:42:01,690
And that is an interesting thing.

892
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:02,790
You'll get a different conversation

893
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:04,011
based on whether you're talking to an artist

894
00:42:04,051 --> 00:42:05,812
or a programmer or what games they play

895
00:42:05,872 --> 00:42:07,353
or if they're in this genre, that kind of thing.

896
00:42:07,633 --> 00:42:08,693
Or just a pessimistic person.

897
00:42:08,974 --> 00:42:10,795
Yes, yes, I have those two.

898
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:16,292
So yeah, we do lots of pessimistic things,

899
00:42:16,712 --> 00:42:17,713
and we're very conservative.

900
00:42:18,933 --> 00:42:22,896
So I go back to this kind of projection, or this sales idea,

901
00:42:22,936 --> 00:42:25,437
and actually calculate how much I need to make

902
00:42:25,517 --> 00:42:26,918
before I spend on a game.

903
00:42:27,318 --> 00:42:30,580
So I know I made a big fuss about how my burn is

904
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,381
very hard to calculate, but I still

905
00:42:32,421 --> 00:42:34,542
want to know a general idea.

906
00:42:34,742 --> 00:42:38,024
In a general way, am I going to spend $100,000 on this game?

907
00:42:38,064 --> 00:42:39,365
Am I spending $400,000 on this game?

908
00:42:39,445 --> 00:42:40,666
Am I spending a million on this game?

909
00:42:41,326 --> 00:42:47,491
and I actually calculate all of that and I see how much I feel like I would need to sell at a minimum.

910
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:52,235
These are basically all of my numbers that I use. This is as deep as I go. I'm sorry.

911
00:42:53,556 --> 00:42:58,419
But it generally works for me that I can see whether I have a realistic expectation.

912
00:42:58,599 --> 00:42:59,840
Is it realistically...

913
00:43:00,914 --> 00:43:04,277
possible for this game to sell the number of copies that I need?

914
00:43:05,078 --> 00:43:09,081
Usually the answer is maybe, but that is still a better answer

915
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:13,325
than literally no, I cannot find a game on Steam that is like this at all,

916
00:43:13,365 --> 00:43:14,606
that has sold anything like this.

917
00:43:15,046 --> 00:43:16,788
That is a scary reality.

918
00:43:16,888 --> 00:43:20,451
That was actually true for Boyfriend Dungeon until Dream Daddy came out.

919
00:43:20,551 --> 00:43:21,772
Oh my god, that was the best day.

920
00:43:24,752 --> 00:43:26,914
And projections are really hard without historical data.

921
00:43:27,535 --> 00:43:29,416
Unfortunately, in the first couple of years of Kit Fox,

922
00:43:29,456 --> 00:43:30,777
it was much, much harder than it is now.

923
00:43:31,558 --> 00:43:33,820
The more data you get from your own games,

924
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:36,362
the better you'll get at your own projections, obviously.

925
00:43:37,703 --> 00:43:39,144
But it's, like I mentioned before,

926
00:43:39,184 --> 00:43:41,346
it is dangerous to assume your game will perform

927
00:43:41,506 --> 00:43:43,187
in the middle, because almost no games do.

928
00:43:43,308 --> 00:43:44,348
We've been really lucky that way.

929
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:47,791
We've been very middle-classy, release-y developer.

930
00:43:48,552 --> 00:43:50,293
But usually you'll sell either very poorly

931
00:43:50,353 --> 00:43:52,715
or very well, unfortunately.

932
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:54,560
But yeah, good luck with that.

933
00:43:57,883 --> 00:43:59,765
I'm very uplifting, I'm very uplifting.

934
00:44:00,586 --> 00:44:03,128
I am an optimist, this is part of why I hate money.

935
00:44:03,168 --> 00:44:05,911
Anyway, so assuming that we've met

936
00:44:05,971 --> 00:44:07,352
our long-term goal of survival,

937
00:44:07,592 --> 00:44:10,635
now we reach this existential moment in Kid Fox's history.

938
00:44:10,655 --> 00:44:12,336
I think we're actually gonna look back

939
00:44:12,356 --> 00:44:12,697
at 2018 in the future.

940
00:44:14,298 --> 00:44:15,719
Because we have money projected to be coming in,

941
00:44:15,799 --> 00:44:17,960
how can we best meet these other goals?

942
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,461
Do we have other goals?

943
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:22,742
We need to think as a company, now that we are surviving,

944
00:44:22,782 --> 00:44:23,703
what is our third goal?

945
00:44:24,723 --> 00:44:26,324
Should we give ourselves better raises?

946
00:44:26,584 --> 00:44:27,765
Should we hire more people?

947
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:30,186
We've actually talked about maybe moving to Japan

948
00:44:30,266 --> 00:44:31,707
would be a fine trade-off.

949
00:44:32,167 --> 00:44:32,968
Like, we don't really know.

950
00:44:33,568 --> 00:44:36,089
I mostly just want to keep designing cool games.

951
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:38,711
So I guess, wish us luck.

952
00:44:38,831 --> 00:44:40,732
But in the meantime, Clever Endeavor

953
00:44:40,812 --> 00:44:43,533
does a little bit more than we do on the projection side.

954
00:44:44,226 --> 00:44:46,168
Also, we're going to try and make sure that she stays in Montreal.

955
00:44:46,628 --> 00:44:47,830
That's hard.

956
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:52,054
Yeah, so we have a little bit more of a complicated system that we use at Clever Endeavor.

957
00:44:52,174 --> 00:44:55,497
I should mention, I didn't put this in the slides, but you're talking about the employees

958
00:44:55,517 --> 00:44:56,958
making projections, and we actually did that.

959
00:44:57,561 --> 00:44:59,382
three, well we were just three partners at the time,

960
00:45:00,022 --> 00:45:01,503
made projections before our game launched,

961
00:45:01,963 --> 00:45:04,204
and we got a very wide range,

962
00:45:04,384 --> 00:45:07,185
like I think it was like 10,000 units

963
00:45:07,265 --> 00:45:09,386
to like 400,000 units was the range.

964
00:45:10,226 --> 00:45:12,387
That was the most pessimistic and the least pessimistic,

965
00:45:12,407 --> 00:45:14,248
or the most optimistic, and only three people,

966
00:45:14,288 --> 00:45:15,068
so you can imagine.

967
00:45:16,049 --> 00:45:19,071
Any who, so yeah, so we're a little bit more in depth.

968
00:45:19,492 --> 00:45:21,113
Part of that is because a couple of us

969
00:45:21,153 --> 00:45:22,614
kind of like playing with Google Sheets

970
00:45:22,674 --> 00:45:23,956
and formulas and things.

971
00:45:24,576 --> 00:45:25,717
And part of it is because,

972
00:45:26,518 --> 00:45:27,599
well we think there are some upsides

973
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:29,220
and we'll discuss the upsides and the downsides

974
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,281
after I go through this.

975
00:45:31,342 --> 00:45:33,764
So we have this big complicated document

976
00:45:33,804 --> 00:45:36,226
that we update monthly or whenever we need

977
00:45:36,406 --> 00:45:37,287
to make an adjustment.

978
00:45:37,547 --> 00:45:39,949
It's not that complicated, but it'll look complicated,

979
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:41,370
but I'll try to explain.

980
00:45:42,832 --> 00:45:42,952
So,

981
00:45:44,166 --> 00:45:48,789
This is the main tab of the projections document.

982
00:45:49,249 --> 00:45:50,610
And you can download this.

983
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:52,951
I actually made a template that people can download,

984
00:45:53,111 --> 00:45:55,112
and I'll show you the link to download that

985
00:45:55,132 --> 00:45:56,873
throughout the slides and at the end.

986
00:45:58,474 --> 00:46:01,356
So this thing is gonna help us consider

987
00:46:01,396 --> 00:46:03,397
many different scenarios and play out

988
00:46:03,437 --> 00:46:04,538
different scenarios in our minds

989
00:46:04,598 --> 00:46:06,439
and see how long we have to survive.

990
00:46:07,375 --> 00:46:09,136
So just breaking this down a little bit.

991
00:46:10,297 --> 00:46:11,897
So we see there's one section with cash on hand,

992
00:46:11,937 --> 00:46:14,398
that's whatever money you have, bank accounts,

993
00:46:14,658 --> 00:46:16,099
if you have investments or anything like that.

994
00:46:17,659 --> 00:46:19,600
The next section is gonna be receivables.

995
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,601
So that's gonna be money that you're expecting

996
00:46:21,661 --> 00:46:22,982
to, that's coming in from Steam,

997
00:46:23,002 --> 00:46:24,202
let's say that you haven't received yet,

998
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:27,483
or whatever money that's coming from a deal in the future.

999
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:32,121
And then you've got all the stuff that you have to spend in general and it's

1000
00:46:32,141 --> 00:46:35,863
sorry when I say projections document, it's not just projections, it's all the

1001
00:46:35,883 --> 00:46:39,844
cash in all the cash out and then this sort of runway calculation. So this

1002
00:46:40,205 --> 00:46:43,886
this other part is expenses which are broken down based on monthly or annual

1003
00:46:44,306 --> 00:46:48,288
expenses or per project expenses or simply one time expenses so something

1004
00:46:48,328 --> 00:46:51,750
like audio have to pay per project where something like accounting fees,

1005
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:55,571
let's say maybe that's monthly or yearly. So I allow for breaking that

1006
00:46:55,631 --> 00:46:57,352
those down into the different categories.

1007
00:46:58,033 --> 00:47:01,954
and then when you're doing your actual projections,

1008
00:47:01,974 --> 00:47:03,114
you can see the highlighted part here

1009
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:05,015
is how many months ahead do you want to calculate

1010
00:47:05,315 --> 00:47:06,655
and how many projects you think you're gonna make.

1011
00:47:06,715 --> 00:47:08,055
So you say, okay, 36 months,

1012
00:47:08,416 --> 00:47:09,596
we're gonna make two new projects.

1013
00:47:10,056 --> 00:47:11,856
So that'll pull the per project costs

1014
00:47:11,916 --> 00:47:16,178
and that'll put that in the calculations

1015
00:47:16,878 --> 00:47:18,218
and it'll include the monthly costs

1016
00:47:18,298 --> 00:47:19,378
based on how many months.

1017
00:47:20,398 --> 00:47:21,659
But look at all those tabs.

1018
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:22,720
There's a lot of tabs.

1019
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:25,321
So each tab is a separate chunk.

1020
00:47:25,361 --> 00:47:27,543
And I try to make it simpler by having these tabs.

1021
00:47:28,544 --> 00:47:32,767
The idea being that each tab can be one chunk.

1022
00:47:32,827 --> 00:47:34,388
So salaries, for example, is one tab.

1023
00:47:35,068 --> 00:47:39,071
But the power of this was that we have a list of employees

1024
00:47:39,392 --> 00:47:41,013
and how much they're being paid.

1025
00:47:41,053 --> 00:47:42,034
This isn't actual numbers.

1026
00:47:42,054 --> 00:47:42,954
These are just made up numbers.

1027
00:47:44,575 --> 00:47:46,796
There's also, so you can see the employee

1028
00:47:46,817 --> 00:47:47,517
and how much they're getting paid.

1029
00:47:47,537 --> 00:47:49,278
There's also government contributions.

1030
00:47:49,418 --> 00:47:52,840
So in Canada and Quebec, there's a certain amount

1031
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:54,620
that you remit to the government for taxes.

1032
00:47:54,761 --> 00:47:56,902
I presume that in the US there's similar things.

1033
00:47:57,442 --> 00:47:58,482
So it allows you to calculate

1034
00:47:58,522 --> 00:48:00,023
by whatever government contribution,

1035
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:02,004
so you can find out how much your company's actually paying

1036
00:48:02,645 --> 00:48:04,005
as opposed to just the gross salary.

1037
00:48:05,286 --> 00:48:07,607
The other thing is you can put potential raises.

1038
00:48:07,627 --> 00:48:09,268
So you're saying, okay, well what if we gave everybody

1039
00:48:09,308 --> 00:48:10,088
a raise of this much?

1040
00:48:10,609 --> 00:48:12,550
What would that do to our bottom line?

1041
00:48:13,539 --> 00:48:16,501
and the other thing is you can put potential place they're thinking okay

1042
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:19,643
what if we hire two employees and we give a raise to one employee

1043
00:48:20,183 --> 00:48:21,524
uh... how is that can affect it

1044
00:48:21,944 --> 00:48:25,887
and all that gets fed back into the main sheet which gives us our our final

1045
00:48:25,927 --> 00:48:28,908
output which is okay you have fourteen months to survive or whatever

1046
00:48:30,881 --> 00:48:37,208
So the game projections are done in an interesting way that was done by one of my colleagues, Alex.

1047
00:48:37,849 --> 00:48:42,154
And we've sort of argued about it and fixed it throughout the process.

1048
00:48:43,075 --> 00:48:44,437
The page looks a little like this.

1049
00:48:45,859 --> 00:48:47,380
So the way it works is...

1050
00:48:47,961 --> 00:48:51,203
We say if the game is already out, we know how much we've earned one month.

1051
00:48:52,203 --> 00:48:54,965
Most games do this sort of, you know, curve down,

1052
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:57,527
and so we assume that our game is going to do the same.

1053
00:48:58,447 --> 00:49:02,169
And what we do there is that we can choose if we want a fast decay rate,

1054
00:49:02,209 --> 00:49:03,690
so it means it's going to go down very quickly,

1055
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:06,031
or a slower decay rate if we think the game is doing well.

1056
00:49:06,612 --> 00:49:09,476
The nice thing with this is that we can actually check back

1057
00:49:09,616 --> 00:49:11,839
after each month and say, okay, how are we doing

1058
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,822
compared to what we're calling the medium estimate

1059
00:49:13,862 --> 00:49:14,703
or the slow estimate?

1060
00:49:15,404 --> 00:49:17,427
You can also flip this and just make it immediate.

1061
00:49:17,527 --> 00:49:19,711
So it decays immediately, you stop making money forever.

1062
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:21,653
That's the super pessimistic thing you were talking about.

1063
00:49:22,163 --> 00:49:28,606
Except that it's interesting to me that we both had a better year two in our major game

1064
00:49:28,646 --> 00:49:30,026
than we had a year one, right?

1065
00:49:30,046 --> 00:49:30,226
Yes.

1066
00:49:31,087 --> 00:49:36,929
And that's why, so actually there's a couple things in the slide that I'm, I guess I have

1067
00:49:36,949 --> 00:49:38,349
a couple minutes, I'll go into a bit of detail.

1068
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:42,531
So there are also percent bumps that you can do, so you can say, okay, well we know summer

1069
00:49:42,551 --> 00:49:45,352
sale is happening at this point, we expect we're going to make 200% what we usually make.

1070
00:49:46,712 --> 00:49:50,433
So then you put that in and that will just bump it and bring it back down to

1071
00:49:50,473 --> 00:49:52,094
the same decay that it was using before.

1072
00:49:53,314 --> 00:49:55,134
But I believe this is...

1073
00:49:55,955 --> 00:49:58,155
Okay, yeah. So it is somewhat complicated looking,

1074
00:49:58,635 --> 00:50:00,796
but it does allow us to think of actual scenarios.

1075
00:50:00,816 --> 00:50:03,376
So we will think of a scenario that's, like I said before,

1076
00:50:03,396 --> 00:50:05,357
hiring two people or giving one person a raise,

1077
00:50:05,737 --> 00:50:09,498
or starting a new project, or going to Gamescom and GDC and PAX.

1078
00:50:10,238 --> 00:50:10,938
How does that affect us?

1079
00:50:12,022 --> 00:50:14,664
And another thing which I didn't mention here

1080
00:50:15,044 --> 00:50:17,826
is that there's also for future game projections,

1081
00:50:17,906 --> 00:50:20,968
so future game sales, we don't do this decay thing

1082
00:50:21,069 --> 00:50:23,671
because it's about as useful to pick a random number

1083
00:50:23,731 --> 00:50:25,772
and decay from there as it is to just have an overall.

1084
00:50:26,673 --> 00:50:28,134
But there is a sheet on that spreadsheet

1085
00:50:28,194 --> 00:50:29,315
that gives you a breakdown of,

1086
00:50:29,855 --> 00:50:32,938
you set how much money is going to a publisher,

1087
00:50:32,958 --> 00:50:34,078
how much money is going to an investor,

1088
00:50:34,098 --> 00:50:35,560
how much money is going to the platforms

1089
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:36,320
that are taking their cut.

1090
00:50:36,901 --> 00:50:41,644
and then you can see how many copies of games you have to sell at what price to

1091
00:50:41,684 --> 00:50:44,326
be able to make a certain amount of money. So there's just this big table and

1092
00:50:44,346 --> 00:50:47,988
you can kind of find out like, oh, if we're selling our game at $40, then we

1093
00:50:48,028 --> 00:50:52,551
only have to sell half as many and things like that. You can grab this

1094
00:50:53,172 --> 00:50:58,535
Cashflow document thing at cleverendeavorgames.com slash cashflow or

1095
00:50:59,116 --> 00:51:02,278
I wrote a Gamasutra article about this that was just sort of a really short

1096
00:51:02,318 --> 00:51:04,680
blurb and it links to this website as well.

1097
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:06,511
It'll also be on the last slide.

1098
00:51:06,571 --> 00:51:07,992
Yeah, it'll be on the question slide as well.

1099
00:51:08,573 --> 00:51:10,835
And as Tanya was saying, it's kind of hard

1100
00:51:10,875 --> 00:51:12,797
to know how your sales are going to be

1101
00:51:12,817 --> 00:51:17,762
in the future, which makes this an interesting endeavor.

1102
00:51:18,182 --> 00:51:22,106
You can see our launch was the first little tiny blip, which

1103
00:51:22,186 --> 00:51:22,867
is somewhat rare.

1104
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:26,530
When you look at most games, the launch is obviously higher,

1105
00:51:26,971 --> 00:51:28,072
and they scale down.

1106
00:51:28,212 --> 00:51:30,274
Ours launched really tiny.

1107
00:51:30,714 --> 00:51:34,595
there for summer sales big and then our next winter sales even bigger and

1108
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:39,156
somehow our winter sale after the game was almost two years old was better

1109
00:51:39,276 --> 00:51:42,517
than our winter sale after the game was one year old with the same discount.

1110
00:51:43,838 --> 00:51:46,478
So there's a lot of things I mean at that point the game was probably more

1111
00:51:46,518 --> 00:51:50,179
popular more people who had wish listed it and so on but the point is that

1112
00:51:50,699 --> 00:51:53,280
it's not always it's not standard across the board for sure.

1113
00:51:53,988 --> 00:51:56,409
And it's always good to be pessimistic because you never

1114
00:51:56,429 --> 00:51:58,570
know if your second year winter sale for some reason

1115
00:51:58,631 --> 00:52:00,732
is going to do better than the first one or significantly

1116
00:52:00,752 --> 00:52:00,952
worse.

1117
00:52:02,553 --> 00:52:04,394
So there are some pros and cons to this.

1118
00:52:05,775 --> 00:52:07,676
So one of the pros is that you can see where you can save

1119
00:52:07,736 --> 00:52:07,896
money.

1120
00:52:08,516 --> 00:52:09,677
When I say pros and cons to this,

1121
00:52:09,737 --> 00:52:11,018
I mean going in depth about this.

1122
00:52:11,578 --> 00:52:14,720
And that is, like I said, you'd flip one employee on or off,

1123
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,541
and you can see how much extra money

1124
00:52:16,561 --> 00:52:18,122
you're going to spend or save.

1125
00:52:19,153 --> 00:52:22,674
The other thing is you can understand your sort of short term decisions.

1126
00:52:22,734 --> 00:52:26,736
So if we go to PAX this year, how much is that actually going to cost us in terms of

1127
00:52:26,796 --> 00:52:27,756
months of survival?

1128
00:52:28,557 --> 00:52:30,937
You can also think about longer term strategy.

1129
00:52:31,057 --> 00:52:35,939
So that was again with employees or starting several projects at once or going into a new

1130
00:52:35,979 --> 00:52:36,460
office space.

1131
00:52:38,056 --> 00:52:39,376
On the other hand, it takes time,

1132
00:52:40,076 --> 00:52:42,457
and there is certainly a strong argument to be made

1133
00:52:42,557 --> 00:52:44,818
for maybe you should spend your time making better games,

1134
00:52:45,218 --> 00:52:47,118
and they're gonna sell however they sell.

1135
00:52:47,798 --> 00:52:50,119
So that's definitely an argument that can be valid.

1136
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:53,760
The other thing is that we're never actually sure.

1137
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,741
This isn't a super reliable thing.

1138
00:52:56,781 --> 00:52:57,421
Like we said before,

1139
00:52:57,461 --> 00:52:59,141
you can't predict five years into the future.

1140
00:53:01,316 --> 00:53:03,297
But we like doing it at Clever Endeavor.

1141
00:53:04,458 --> 00:53:05,659
Tiny doesn't like doing it quite as much,

1142
00:53:05,759 --> 00:53:07,440
but they still do some amount.

1143
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,001
And I think that across the board,

1144
00:53:09,121 --> 00:53:11,203
regardless you should be thinking about this

1145
00:53:11,243 --> 00:53:12,423
and you should be doing these projections,

1146
00:53:13,024 --> 00:53:15,185
the level of detail is, of course, up to you.

1147
00:53:16,406 --> 00:53:18,067
So, how do we wrap this all up?

1148
00:53:19,268 --> 00:53:21,550
So, oh, that's incorrect.

1149
00:53:22,615 --> 00:53:28,417
So regardless of how you feel, I do think that it is important as a business owner to

1150
00:53:28,457 --> 00:53:30,457
think about what strategies you're going to have.

1151
00:53:30,837 --> 00:53:35,719
And even beyond strategy, I actually think that it's maybe most important to keep your

1152
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:40,360
eyes open and stay reactive to what opportunities come available because that is definitely

1153
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,781
the most common thing across both of our strategies.

1154
00:53:43,381 --> 00:53:44,843
is that we were opportunistic in some way.

1155
00:53:44,903 --> 00:53:47,425
We had an amazing opportunity and we had to keep,

1156
00:53:47,765 --> 00:53:48,506
we had to do that.

1157
00:53:48,586 --> 00:53:50,128
Whether it was me jumping on Moon Hunters

1158
00:53:50,708 --> 00:53:52,730
or it was doubling down on the success

1159
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:54,372
of Ultimate Chicken Horse,

1160
00:53:55,673 --> 00:53:58,656
you really have to respond when you get new information.

1161
00:53:59,437 --> 00:54:01,157
So I mean, different studios obviously

1162
00:54:01,177 --> 00:54:02,537
have different methods, different goals,

1163
00:54:02,557 --> 00:54:03,297
different constraints.

1164
00:54:03,337 --> 00:54:05,258
There's no one right way to run your company.

1165
00:54:06,418 --> 00:54:08,179
And I think anyone who claims otherwise

1166
00:54:08,239 --> 00:54:09,419
is trying to sell you something.

1167
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:13,980
But as a business owner to other potential business owners,

1168
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,360
treat your employees well.

1169
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,601
Maybe allow them to unionize.

1170
00:54:17,941 --> 00:54:21,142
And think carefully about why you're doing what you're doing.

1171
00:54:22,222 --> 00:54:24,962
Calculate your costs, your risks, your consequences.

1172
00:54:25,343 --> 00:54:26,763
And you'll have a strategy that works for you

1173
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:29,283
and for your team to achieve your goals.

1174
00:54:29,944 --> 00:54:30,284
Thank you.

1175
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:42,592
All right, so we have time for one or two questions.

1176
00:54:42,672 --> 00:54:46,235
There are microphones there and there, but if you leave, I'm not hurt at all.

1177
00:54:47,256 --> 00:54:48,436
So please, any questions?

1178
00:54:53,613 --> 00:54:59,241
This is mostly for Tanya. Do you find it hard to resist kind of or do you feel pressure to

1179
00:54:59,802 --> 00:55:06,211
Keep investing in your existing games and like do the games as a service thing and how do you sort of resist that and make?

1180
00:55:06,231 --> 00:55:07,813
Sure, you're putting resources into your new game

1181
00:55:09,117 --> 00:55:12,419
For Moon Hunters, we did end up reinvesting quite a bit.

1182
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:15,901
We were porting it to multiple platforms,

1183
00:55:16,201 --> 00:55:18,242
and even when it wasn't selling very well,

1184
00:55:18,282 --> 00:55:20,383
we had decided to make a free DLC

1185
00:55:21,323 --> 00:55:22,564
for six months after that.

1186
00:55:23,424 --> 00:55:25,726
And part of that was that we didn't want to leave it

1187
00:55:25,766 --> 00:55:27,226
in a state that we weren't proud of it.

1188
00:55:28,614 --> 00:55:33,437
So that was kind of an emotional, like, can we survive making this thing?

1189
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:39,020
Yes, then we probably should because otherwise we'll just have this project that we're always kind of embarrassed by, whereas now

1190
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:42,322
I don't, I don't feel that way. I mean, I'm not gonna go around saying it's the perfect game,

1191
00:55:42,362 --> 00:55:46,184
but I'm not embarrassed by it, and that was more important to me. I think

1192
00:55:47,124 --> 00:55:48,667
It is a question of personality,

1193
00:55:48,687 --> 00:55:51,491
whether you enjoy LiveOps or hate it.

1194
00:55:52,853 --> 00:55:53,914
I personally enjoy LiveOps.

1195
00:55:53,954 --> 00:55:56,859
My first few jobs were on Live MMOs, actually.

1196
00:55:56,899 --> 00:55:58,882
I was hired onto Age of Conan right as it launched,

1197
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:00,003
and it was the best job ever.

1198
00:56:01,866 --> 00:56:03,668
So I don't have a good answer for you,

1199
00:56:04,489 --> 00:56:06,892
except that some reinvestment is probably wise.

1200
00:56:07,052 --> 00:56:09,175
And obviously for us, porting to different platforms

1201
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:10,757
has definitely been helpful for us

1202
00:56:11,518 --> 00:56:12,840
and making those business relationships.

1203
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:15,042
Every time we've released on a new console,

1204
00:56:15,383 --> 00:56:16,424
our Steam sales have boosted.

1205
00:56:16,925 --> 00:56:19,687
So for us, we've decided that simultaneous launch,

1206
00:56:19,728 --> 00:56:22,090
although it's common wisdom, is not best for us

1207
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:24,813
because our community is fractured

1208
00:56:24,853 --> 00:56:25,794
and it's all over the place,

1209
00:56:26,154 --> 00:56:29,057
and by having it have new news cycles

1210
00:56:29,157 --> 00:56:30,999
and press cycles and influencer cycles,

1211
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,681
we can actually make our primary platform, Steam,

1212
00:56:33,721 --> 00:56:34,182
sell better.

1213
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:36,530
Yes, I should also add it is an opportunity thing, right?

1214
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:39,252
Like we're continuing this because the game's doing well.

1215
00:56:39,332 --> 00:56:41,693
If it wasn't, if it tanked, then we would say,

1216
00:56:41,713 --> 00:56:43,414
well, forget it, we're onto the next thing.

1217
00:56:44,315 --> 00:56:46,136
Not to say a game that is doing badly

1218
00:56:46,156 --> 00:56:47,237
can't be sort of revived,

1219
00:56:47,757 --> 00:56:50,479
but it is like we talked about, really an opportunity thing.

1220
00:56:51,279 --> 00:56:52,220
Let's go on this side this time.

1221
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,501
Well, first of all, thank you for your talk.

1222
00:56:54,962 --> 00:56:56,283
My name is Nacho, like the Mexican food.

1223
00:56:56,963 --> 00:57:00,385
Anyhow, I have a quick question regarding ecosystems,

1224
00:57:00,945 --> 00:57:01,306
for instance.

1225
00:57:03,141 --> 00:57:07,026
I, I am from Mendoza, Argentina, right? Uh, and one of the issues we have over there is

1226
00:57:07,066 --> 00:57:13,013
that our ecosystem doesn't provide any sort of help. So, uh, the only solution that we

1227
00:57:13,053 --> 00:57:20,602
have is bootstrapping. Uh, uh, how would you say, uh, uh, I mean, is bootstrapping for real

1228
00:57:20,622 --> 00:57:22,564
the only option we got down there, for instance?

1229
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,944
I mean, there's Kickstarter, there's, I mean,

1230
00:57:27,224 --> 00:57:28,846
every country has the idea of loans,

1231
00:57:28,986 --> 00:57:31,008
but it depends how favorable they will be

1232
00:57:31,088 --> 00:57:32,890
and who they will lend to, obviously.

1233
00:57:33,607 --> 00:57:38,371
There's also the idea of starting working part-time or working full-time while working

1234
00:57:38,411 --> 00:57:40,953
on your project part-time, a lot of people do, to get started.

1235
00:57:41,714 --> 00:57:46,257
And then sometimes that, again, it's a different ecosystem, but in our ecosystem, if you have

1236
00:57:46,277 --> 00:57:50,180
something that you can show, that's a lot more likely to get some publisher attention

1237
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,862
or someone who can put some money into it.

1238
00:57:51,922 --> 00:57:58,507
So maybe the project starts part-time or remote or something, and then you're at a point where

1239
00:57:58,847 --> 00:58:00,608
you might be able to more favorably get a loan.

1240
00:58:00,968 --> 00:58:05,830
Like one of the most common ways to survive for a studio that we almost never talk about is work for hire

1241
00:58:06,111 --> 00:58:11,593
Which is taking some or all of your employees and working on someone else's game and they pay you to do it

1242
00:58:12,553 --> 00:58:17,675
And that gives you experience it gives you contacts and it can level your team up a bit

1243
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:23,138
The problem is getting those contracts when you haven't made a single game together before is very difficult.

1244
00:58:23,178 --> 00:58:27,420
Because like me, I wouldn't contract you out, I wouldn't give you money to do work for hire until you've made a game.

1245
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:31,602
So before making your first game, one thing that we didn't mention on any of our slides

1246
00:58:32,022 --> 00:58:34,824
is the fact that we can't account for the number of studios that have closed.

1247
00:58:35,464 --> 00:58:38,726
Like that Montreal Studios thing, like those are six studios who still exist.

1248
00:58:39,206 --> 00:58:42,309
as opposed to all the studios that probably almost existed

1249
00:58:42,369 --> 00:58:42,969
and then didn't.

1250
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:46,052
So short answer is that yes,

1251
00:58:46,092 --> 00:58:48,254
it is absolutely much harder in some studios,

1252
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:49,955
or some cities and some locations,

1253
00:58:50,015 --> 00:58:52,758
and Montreal is maybe an ideal place in a lot of ways.

1254
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,101
But if you can't bootstrap,

1255
00:58:56,561 --> 00:58:58,563
definitely find money wherever you can

1256
00:58:58,603 --> 00:59:00,585
and think about what services you can provide

1257
00:59:00,625 --> 00:59:01,786
to other people and businesses.

1258
00:59:02,226 --> 00:59:03,007
Well, thank you very much.

1259
00:59:03,027 --> 00:59:03,587
Thank you.

1260
00:59:03,607 --> 00:59:03,908
Welcome.

1261
00:59:05,409 --> 00:59:06,590
Thanks for the talk, guys.

1262
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:07,110
It was really cool.

1263
00:59:07,708 --> 00:59:10,653
I had some questions about early investment,

1264
00:59:11,013 --> 00:59:12,315
and the projection stuff was really neat,

1265
00:59:12,355 --> 00:59:15,400
but when you were meeting early on with investors,

1266
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:17,903
what kind of breakdown were they looking for?

1267
00:59:17,963 --> 00:59:19,846
How much of that was on the creative side?

1268
00:59:19,906 --> 00:59:21,829
How much of that was, hey, can we see your projections?

1269
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:23,211
Do they feel accurate to us?

1270
00:59:24,411 --> 00:59:29,695
So for us it was really, it was a standard program actually for both the VEC-ish thing

1271
00:59:30,015 --> 00:59:32,357
and the Execution Labs incubator thing.

1272
00:59:32,397 --> 00:59:36,980
They were both a situation where they had a certain amount of money set aside for these

1273
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:40,983
kinds of profiles and then I just had to convince them I was that profile.

1274
00:59:41,603 --> 00:59:45,246
So like the more information I could get about what they wanted to hear was the best.

1275
00:59:47,929 --> 00:59:51,111
And in those cases, I mean, they assume that it's all going to be payroll.

1276
00:59:51,151 --> 00:59:53,894
Like, they know that you're not going to spend all this money on a Lamborghini or whatever.

1277
00:59:54,534 --> 00:59:58,277
So it really wasn't about, like, tell me exactly where this dollar is going.

1278
00:59:58,318 --> 01:00:00,119
It was more like, how much are you paying yourselves?

1279
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:02,121
How many people do you have for how long?

1280
01:00:02,521 --> 01:00:04,543
And they can do it in their own head to figure out, like,

1281
01:00:04,643 --> 01:00:06,665
oh, if you pay yourself minimum wage, this will last you this long.

1282
01:00:06,705 --> 01:00:09,187
If you pay yourself normal salary, it'll last you this long.

1283
01:00:10,308 --> 01:00:10,748
And that's kind of...

1284
01:00:11,449 --> 01:00:17,318
been fine. I mean even for fairly late stage like publisher money it was still

1285
01:00:17,378 --> 01:00:23,527
kind of what is your burn rate was the number one question rather than how much

1286
01:00:23,567 --> 01:00:25,490
are you spending on audio or whatever.

1287
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:28,972
And I should say, when we were pitching investors,

1288
01:00:28,992 --> 01:00:31,493
so we ended up actually having a fortunate situation.

1289
01:00:31,513 --> 01:00:34,514
We had a family friend investor, and then a bunch of family

1290
01:00:34,534 --> 01:00:35,134
sort of jumped on.

1291
01:00:36,415 --> 01:00:38,436
And so we got favorable terms, but we still

1292
01:00:38,476 --> 01:00:39,556
did the full pitch thing.

1293
01:00:39,816 --> 01:00:42,657
And for us, the big thing was comparing other games that

1294
01:00:43,358 --> 01:00:46,019
are out already and comparing their sales and saying, OK,

1295
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:48,820
if we do badly, then we're sorry.

1296
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:50,240
There are some that did really, really badly,

1297
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:51,121
and we think this is why.

1298
01:00:51,501 --> 01:00:53,122
there are some that did fairly badly

1299
01:00:53,222 --> 01:00:54,142
and you'll make your money back

1300
01:00:54,503 --> 01:00:56,324
and this is what will happen if we do fairly badly.

1301
01:00:56,684 --> 01:00:57,724
And this is the upshot.

1302
01:00:57,905 --> 01:01:00,426
So it's kind of like show the probable situation

1303
01:01:01,326 --> 01:01:02,267
and then sell the dream

1304
01:01:02,667 --> 01:01:03,988
and they understand that that's the dream

1305
01:01:04,068 --> 01:01:05,789
but that's what they're investing in, right?

1306
01:01:06,389 --> 01:01:07,050
So there's the burn rate

1307
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:08,370
and then there's what you think you're gonna make.

1308
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:09,391
And if you have comparisons,

1309
01:01:09,511 --> 01:01:10,772
I mean, Boyfriend Dungeon will be harder

1310
01:01:10,852 --> 01:01:12,993
because there's not as much comparison

1311
01:01:13,013 --> 01:01:15,014
but in our case, it was a lot easier to find games

1312
01:01:15,054 --> 01:01:17,035
that were like, well, here's seven games that are similar

1313
01:01:17,395 --> 01:01:18,556
that have all done this well.

1314
01:01:18,596 --> 01:01:21,058
Oh, I absolutely told a venture capitalist at some point

1315
01:01:21,098 --> 01:01:23,000
that we were intending to grow to 100 people

1316
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:24,922
and that was a total lie.

1317
01:01:25,122 --> 01:01:26,964
But thank you, it was put to good use.

1318
01:01:28,085 --> 01:01:30,507
Yeah, so we are past time, so thank you very much.

1319
01:01:30,527 --> 01:01:31,588
We will take more questions over here.

1320
01:01:31,628 --> 01:01:31,909
Thank you!
