1
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:06,259
Hi everyone, thank you for coming to my talk.

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,083
My name's Tyler and this is Dream Daddy,

3
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:14,805
how we created player inclusivity and you can too.

4
00:00:16,567 --> 00:00:21,911
This is the first talk I've given in about 10 years.

5
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:24,093
So come on this journey with me.

6
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,572
Is anyone else really nervous?

7
00:00:33,592 --> 00:00:35,093
OK, no.

8
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:37,175
So here's me.

9
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:38,496
I'm Tyler J. Hutchison.

10
00:00:40,478 --> 00:00:42,620
I work for a company called Game Grumps.

11
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:44,341
You might know them.

12
00:00:46,563 --> 00:00:52,889
And I was the director and lead developer of a video game

13
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:54,550
called Dream Daddy.

14
00:00:57,973 --> 00:00:59,153
Hey, Dad Dating Simulator.

15
00:01:00,334 --> 00:01:03,555
For those of you who aren't aware of what Dream Daddy is,

16
00:01:03,675 --> 00:01:06,756
I feel like some of you might know since you came to this

17
00:01:06,836 --> 00:01:09,457
talk and it's in front of the door.

18
00:01:10,177 --> 00:01:13,298
But for those of you who don't know what Dream Daddy is,

19
00:01:13,858 --> 00:01:15,779
it was a very successful game that came out

20
00:01:15,839 --> 00:01:17,079
on Steam this summer.

21
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:23,521
In Dream Daddy, you play as a dad whose goal is to meet

22
00:01:24,142 --> 00:01:27,423
and romance the dad of his dreams.

23
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:31,045
It's a gay dad dating simulator.

24
00:01:34,257 --> 00:01:37,639
So this talk, how we created player inclusivity,

25
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:38,720
and you can too.

26
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:43,143
It's kind of important for a game that's

27
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:45,184
a dating simulator about men dating other men.

28
00:01:47,165 --> 00:01:50,747
And you might expect the next slide

29
00:01:50,967 --> 00:01:55,230
to answer a very important question for you.

30
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,211
This is an advocacy talk after all,

31
00:01:57,591 --> 00:01:58,952
so you might expect me to say, why?

32
00:02:01,076 --> 00:02:02,337
Why should you care about this talk?

33
00:02:02,377 --> 00:02:04,899
Why should you care about player inclusivity?

34
00:02:06,701 --> 00:02:08,122
Well, it's 2018.

35
00:02:08,722 --> 00:02:12,946
I'm not going to answer this question for you.

36
00:02:13,086 --> 00:02:14,527
It's kind of already been answered

37
00:02:14,607 --> 00:02:16,389
by numerous other people.

38
00:02:18,832 --> 00:02:21,973
I'm going to draw your attention to these talks, which you can watch on the GDC Vault.

39
00:02:22,814 --> 00:02:25,175
Most of them are between 30 to 60 minutes.

40
00:02:25,775 --> 00:02:31,358
So if you bring them up on your phone right now and watch it at 60 times speed, we can

41
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:34,019
all get done with them within about a minute.

42
00:02:41,447 --> 00:02:44,528
OK, so I think we're probably all on the same page now.

43
00:02:44,588 --> 00:02:47,190
We agree that player inclusivity is really important

44
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:47,910
to have in your games.

45
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,511
And it probably makes for better games.

46
00:02:49,611 --> 00:02:51,491
And no, it definitely makes for better games.

47
00:02:51,531 --> 00:02:52,072
Not probably.

48
00:02:52,092 --> 00:02:52,572
What's wrong with me?

49
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,531
So you also might be coming to this talk

50
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:02,812
hoping and expecting me to be an expert to tell you

51
00:03:02,872 --> 00:03:08,113
how to make your game diverse and what to strive for,

52
00:03:08,213 --> 00:03:09,974
how to make a really excellent, diverse game.

53
00:03:10,754 --> 00:03:16,655
You might even expect that this talk will be, oh, what?

54
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:17,195
Oh, no.

55
00:03:18,716 --> 00:03:19,456
This killed my joke.

56
00:03:21,643 --> 00:03:22,484
Comprehensive!

57
00:03:23,584 --> 00:03:24,045
It's not.

58
00:03:24,425 --> 00:03:28,427
Player inclusivity and diversity is a ginormous topic.

59
00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:31,868
There's so much to cover, and I could not possibly

60
00:03:31,908 --> 00:03:34,149
hope to cover it in a 30-minute talk.

61
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:38,692
If you want a longer version, and probably a better version

62
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:41,053
of this talk that's just all more encompassing

63
00:03:41,253 --> 00:03:43,974
and expansive, I highly recommend

64
00:03:44,194 --> 00:03:46,135
you check out this talk by Meg Giant,

65
00:03:47,076 --> 00:03:48,877
10 Ways to Make Your Game More Diverse.

66
00:03:49,537 --> 00:03:49,677
It's...

67
00:03:50,337 --> 00:03:53,360
very broad and it is also very specific at the same time,

68
00:03:53,521 --> 00:03:55,022
and it's just a great resource.

69
00:03:55,342 --> 00:03:55,923
Please check it out.

70
00:03:56,464 --> 00:03:59,887
Also, it features pictures of baby sloths and puppies.

71
00:04:00,928 --> 00:04:03,130
And now my talk also features pictures

72
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,091
of baby sloths and puppies.

73
00:04:06,474 --> 00:04:09,917
OK, so this isn't the be all, end all talk

74
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:11,018
on player inclusivity.

75
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,341
I'm not an expert.

76
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,416
In case you haven't noticed, I'm like a straight cis white dude.

77
00:04:18,876 --> 00:04:24,084
I'm probably not the best person to be talking about this, but here I am.

78
00:04:26,187 --> 00:04:28,069
So what is this talk about?

79
00:04:29,552 --> 00:04:30,974
Well, Dream Daddy.

80
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,512
is a really cool game that had a lot of big dreams.

81
00:04:36,492 --> 00:04:38,733
We knew we were kind of doing something really cool

82
00:04:38,913 --> 00:04:40,553
and that had not been explored.

83
00:04:41,254 --> 00:04:44,535
And we knew we wanted diversity and inclusivity

84
00:04:44,815 --> 00:04:45,755
as a part of our game.

85
00:04:46,696 --> 00:04:48,016
We felt it was pretty important.

86
00:04:49,076 --> 00:04:52,958
But we had a short timeline to make the game

87
00:04:53,158 --> 00:04:54,238
and we had a small budget.

88
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,140
So a lot of these big dreams and cool ideas we had

89
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,040
were.

90
00:05:00,815 --> 00:05:02,668
Totally out of scope.

91
00:05:05,363 --> 00:05:07,023
If we wanted to accomplish these things,

92
00:05:07,443 --> 00:05:11,244
we had to find a way to make them work within our means.

93
00:05:12,364 --> 00:05:15,105
So what we had to do was figure out a way

94
00:05:15,225 --> 00:05:18,626
to add as much inclusivity and diversity and fun,

95
00:05:18,906 --> 00:05:20,247
the primary thing we really want to make,

96
00:05:20,267 --> 00:05:23,968
it's a fun game, with minimal scope increase.

97
00:05:24,508 --> 00:05:26,548
If you're a developer, you are probably familiar

98
00:05:26,568 --> 00:05:28,849
with the term scope, which is how much stuff

99
00:05:28,869 --> 00:05:29,849
are you going to add to your game?

100
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:31,610
Or how much stuff are you going to add to a project?

101
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:37,615
We needed to find that balance of scope between budget and time.

102
00:05:38,836 --> 00:05:40,637
So we needed minimal scope increases.

103
00:05:40,717 --> 00:05:43,280
You could say we needed no scope increases.

104
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:48,604
Hi, I'm Tyler, did I mention I worked on a game

105
00:05:49,805 --> 00:05:51,467
filled with dad jokes and bad puns.

106
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:53,529
I apologize for that.

107
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,103
The title of this talk, How We Created Player Inclusivity

108
00:05:59,203 --> 00:06:01,844
and You Can Too, might better be summarized

109
00:06:02,165 --> 00:06:05,286
as how we created player inclusivity while still being

110
00:06:05,326 --> 00:06:08,547
mindful of our budget and our timeline.

111
00:06:10,008 --> 00:06:12,609
And it made our game better, just overall.

112
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:13,369
Pretty cool.

113
00:06:14,349 --> 00:06:17,431
So before we begin, there's a few exceptions

114
00:06:18,931 --> 00:06:19,812
I would like to cover.

115
00:06:22,113 --> 00:06:23,033
Your results may vary.

116
00:06:27,756 --> 00:06:28,716
So, some exceptions.

117
00:06:29,077 --> 00:06:30,978
Dream Daddy is not a perfect game.

118
00:06:30,998 --> 00:06:33,819
I mean, like, I think we did a really great job on it,

119
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,001
but it's not the be-all, end-all for player inclusivity and diversity.

120
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:40,283
Again, these are really diverse topics,

121
00:06:40,403 --> 00:06:42,324
and there's a lot of different ways you can approach this.

122
00:06:42,965 --> 00:06:46,047
But I think we did some pretty cool stuff that's worth talking about.

123
00:06:50,013 --> 00:06:52,836
Dream Daddy is a small game, which

124
00:06:53,136 --> 00:06:56,439
allowed us to kind of experiment and do things that you might

125
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:57,700
not see in a very large game.

126
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,604
So as a result, some of the things we did

127
00:07:01,684 --> 00:07:04,026
may not scale to a AAA game.

128
00:07:04,987 --> 00:07:07,910
But I think they would work very well in any small budget,

129
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,494
or even a medium budget game that has a lot of heart.

130
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,332
Hopefully, though, the takeaway from this

131
00:07:17,472 --> 00:07:18,853
is that you'll see some of the things we did,

132
00:07:19,193 --> 00:07:22,476
and it might inspire you to come up with your own ideas

133
00:07:22,796 --> 00:07:25,579
for larger projects and figure out

134
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:28,261
how to make things that scale and also don't eat

135
00:07:28,301 --> 00:07:31,664
into your budget of your game.

136
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:35,567
Because if we can find a way to make our game inclusive

137
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,229
without spending millions of dollars,

138
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:40,046
Why wouldn't you, right?

139
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:43,027
So I think a lot of people seem to think that inclusivity

140
00:07:43,227 --> 00:07:45,048
costs money or it's hard.

141
00:07:45,468 --> 00:07:47,329
You need to have experts and stuff like that.

142
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:48,749
But you don't.

143
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,991
You just need to kind of be thoughtful

144
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:53,952
and take a step back sometimes.

145
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:56,693
OK.

146
00:07:58,453 --> 00:08:00,174
The first way we did things.

147
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:01,995
Let's get to the obvious thing.

148
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:03,836
Sorry, this is zero indexed.

149
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:04,736
I'm a developer.

150
00:08:08,385 --> 00:08:21,613
We told a story, Dream Daddy is a story that features a cast of hot dads who are gay or bisexual or, I don't know, sapiosexual maybe?

151
00:08:23,915 --> 00:08:31,860
But one of the best ways to increase player inclusivity and diversity in your game is to feature characters who are diverse. I can't stress this enough.

152
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,853
Just do it. Tell diverse stories.

153
00:08:35,633 --> 00:08:38,716
It improves the stories. It opens up new creative paths.

154
00:08:39,457 --> 00:08:42,099
But I think everyone here probably knows this already.

155
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,342
If you're coming to a talk about how to increase player inclusivity,

156
00:08:45,902 --> 00:08:48,825
you're probably like, yeah, let's tell stories about diverse characters.

157
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,413
So the next thing we added to Dream Daddy

158
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:56,536
that I think really helped increase player inclusivity

159
00:08:57,116 --> 00:08:57,897
is a character creator.

160
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:01,021
A character creator is a fantastic way

161
00:09:01,361 --> 00:09:04,705
to add diversity to your game, because players

162
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:09,370
are more diverse than I can predict, or you can predict,

163
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,213
or really anyone can predict.

164
00:09:11,793 --> 00:09:16,997
So letting a player represent themselves instantly opens the experience up for them.

165
00:09:18,338 --> 00:09:21,320
And providing players with plenty of options and choices

166
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,182
and how they represent themselves in a game is just fantastic.

167
00:09:27,404 --> 00:09:31,126
The problem we ran into is dating sims and visual novels

168
00:09:31,927 --> 00:09:33,408
normally don't have character creators,

169
00:09:33,668 --> 00:09:37,691
so adding one into ours seemed a little like...

170
00:09:38,837 --> 00:09:43,578
out of scope. Remember, we're on a budget. Adding a character creator to a visual novel,

171
00:09:43,598 --> 00:09:52,602
that's totally out of scope. But we wanted one anyways. So we needed to figure out a

172
00:09:52,642 --> 00:09:56,444
way to add one. We felt it was really important because obviously it helps players feel more

173
00:09:56,464 --> 00:10:02,106
invested in the story. It allows players to be represented. Character creators are fun,

174
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:06,508
right? And also our character creator is going to be called Bill the Dad.

175
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:09,291
And it's for building dad sonas!

176
00:10:09,311 --> 00:10:11,412
We gotta have that!

177
00:10:13,794 --> 00:10:18,958
Except, character creators are usually expensive.

178
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,901
Assets, details, sliders.

179
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:23,902
On a small game like Dream Daddy,

180
00:10:24,282 --> 00:10:26,464
we could never do something like this.

181
00:10:28,386 --> 00:10:29,006
Or this.

182
00:10:29,026 --> 00:10:31,068
Look at that.

183
00:10:31,468 --> 00:10:33,029
Is it, say, jowl depth?

184
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:33,870
What is that?

185
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,397
Or this! This is an amazing character creator.

186
00:10:37,457 --> 00:10:39,939
Like, really cool.

187
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,181
This one is a beautiful character creator from The Sims.

188
00:10:42,822 --> 00:10:45,564
Look at all the choices of how you can make a pair of lips look

189
00:10:45,764 --> 00:10:48,707
almost exactly the same to all these other pairs of lips.

190
00:10:50,548 --> 00:10:52,710
This was really expensive, I bet.

191
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,291
But totally worth it for The Sims.

192
00:10:54,752 --> 00:10:56,813
And this would have looked great in Dream Daddy.

193
00:10:57,474 --> 00:10:59,375
Like, how cool would that be if your dads could look like that?

194
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,535
Here's a modified version of Skyrim's character creator.

195
00:11:04,595 --> 00:11:06,576
Someone decided they didn't have enough sliders

196
00:11:06,636 --> 00:11:08,077
and needed to add more sliders.

197
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:12,720
So people love character creators.

198
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,041
And the amount of effort and detail

199
00:11:14,061 --> 00:11:15,382
that goes into building something like this,

200
00:11:15,803 --> 00:11:17,404
it is really expensive.

201
00:11:17,524 --> 00:11:18,404
And it's a lot of work.

202
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,246
But seriously, so awesome, guys.

203
00:11:21,366 --> 00:11:23,188
Great job.

204
00:11:23,648 --> 00:11:25,549
Please keep making character creators like this.

205
00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:26,270
I love them.

206
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,791
I'm not here to tell you, don't make character creators.

207
00:11:30,933 --> 00:11:33,054
So we wanted one of these.

208
00:11:34,175 --> 00:11:35,075
So we had to do this.

209
00:11:36,836 --> 00:11:39,598
K-I-S-S. If you know what this stands for,

210
00:11:39,618 --> 00:11:42,480
it is keep it simple stupid.

211
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,141
We had to work within our means and come up with something

212
00:11:45,301 --> 00:11:47,102
that we could manage.

213
00:11:48,363 --> 00:11:51,825
So number one, things to building our buildadad,

214
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:54,206
no sliders.

215
00:11:54,487 --> 00:11:55,787
Sliders are really complicated.

216
00:11:56,608 --> 00:11:58,589
You have to create rules and boundaries for them.

217
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:01,393
None.

218
00:12:01,573 --> 00:12:02,773
Sorry, Jerry O'Connell.

219
00:12:04,394 --> 00:12:06,775
So we took a look at the original character

220
00:12:06,795 --> 00:12:08,175
creator, Paper Dolls.

221
00:12:09,616 --> 00:12:12,096
It's maybe not obvious that, hey, this

222
00:12:12,177 --> 00:12:14,697
is a totally functional way to have a character creator.

223
00:12:14,857 --> 00:12:15,778
And it's pretty simple.

224
00:12:15,798 --> 00:12:17,458
You just slap things on top of each other.

225
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,300
Paper dolls are great, especially if you

226
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,920
have tons and tons of assets.

227
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,160
You can just start swapping images in and adding

228
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,901
all kinds of stuff.

229
00:12:26,741 --> 00:12:30,122
But I can't stress how much money we did not

230
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:31,882
have to work with at all times.

231
00:12:32,642 --> 00:12:36,063
So we needed to have some limited choices

232
00:12:36,743 --> 00:12:37,683
in our character creator.

233
00:12:38,403 --> 00:12:41,484
And we really wanted to make these choices count.

234
00:12:42,004 --> 00:12:46,725
So to do that, we focused on big tonal shifts for assets

235
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:48,786
and options rather than subtle ones.

236
00:12:49,546 --> 00:12:51,887
we can't afford to have a thousand pairs of lips

237
00:12:51,967 --> 00:12:53,188
that all kind of look the same.

238
00:12:54,188 --> 00:12:56,349
But we can afford to make big changes

239
00:12:56,569 --> 00:13:00,491
and do things like create three body types

240
00:13:00,591 --> 00:13:05,733
that are all varying in size and shape and are different.

241
00:13:06,894 --> 00:13:11,936
So in Dream Daddy, you can play as this athletic guy,

242
00:13:11,956 --> 00:13:14,757
a thick dad, and a slim daddy.

243
00:13:15,918 --> 00:13:17,598
All of them are, I think,

244
00:13:18,273 --> 00:13:18,913
pretty attractive.

245
00:13:19,373 --> 00:13:21,194
They look great, and they're fun,

246
00:13:21,314 --> 00:13:24,675
and they kind of encompass a wide range of body types.

247
00:13:25,735 --> 00:13:27,675
The important thing is we didn't focus

248
00:13:27,835 --> 00:13:31,336
on letting people adjust their shoulder to width to height

249
00:13:31,376 --> 00:13:37,298
ratio, or their ulna size, or whatever, femur length.

250
00:13:38,598 --> 00:13:41,999
Most people can identify with one of these body types

251
00:13:42,319 --> 00:13:43,720
and say, hey, cool.

252
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,521
This represents me.

253
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,042
We also knew that once your dad Sona was built in the game,

254
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:54,883
you'd mostly be seeing him from the shoulders up.

255
00:13:55,724 --> 00:14:01,006
So we focused on creating a lot of hair assets,

256
00:14:01,647 --> 00:14:04,108
because this is one of the most distinguishing features

257
00:14:04,368 --> 00:14:05,789
on a face, if you like.

258
00:14:06,689 --> 00:14:08,650
looked at someone from 20 feet away,

259
00:14:09,471 --> 00:14:12,032
you can't really focus on their eyes or nose shape,

260
00:14:12,072 --> 00:14:13,313
but you can totally tell someone

261
00:14:14,013 --> 00:14:15,394
who someone is just based on their hair.

262
00:14:15,714 --> 00:14:18,736
So it's a really good way to get a lot of diversity.

263
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:23,018
So we focused on hair texture, color, silhouette,

264
00:14:23,298 --> 00:14:24,519
all of these things that players use

265
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:28,801
to reflect a player's style, race, and gender identity.

266
00:14:30,822 --> 00:14:37,087
We start off with a standard bald, but we also have a pompadour and a lot of hair colors

267
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:40,329
that are not just like white people, only hair.

268
00:14:40,549 --> 00:14:42,111
So when you're making hair...

269
00:14:42,251 --> 00:14:45,794
Oh, I forgot I added that in there.

270
00:14:46,154 --> 00:14:48,596
This is an important hair option in all cases.

271
00:14:51,534 --> 00:14:55,559
Make the effort to make as many hair options for your players

272
00:14:55,599 --> 00:14:58,062
as possible, because hair is extremely diverse.

273
00:14:59,504 --> 00:15:01,687
And we got a lot of bang for our buck just by adding lots

274
00:15:01,727 --> 00:15:02,568
and lots of hair options.

275
00:15:05,368 --> 00:15:07,289
created a pre-selected color palette.

276
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,691
And we did this for some specific reasons.

277
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:13,434
We did not add a full color gradient

278
00:15:13,574 --> 00:15:15,656
so you could create any color skin

279
00:15:16,076 --> 00:15:18,458
because we wanted to be representational

280
00:15:18,698 --> 00:15:22,601
of skin colors specifically and not rainbows.

281
00:15:23,602 --> 00:15:25,223
And if you give someone the ability

282
00:15:25,263 --> 00:15:28,225
to pick one of 256 million colors,

283
00:15:28,505 --> 00:15:30,527
it becomes really hard to find something

284
00:15:30,547 --> 00:15:34,110
that actually you can kind of identify with.

285
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:39,271
So instead, we tried to just develop a nice range of skin colors.

286
00:15:39,891 --> 00:15:43,192
And Leighton, here in the front, spent a long time going through

287
00:15:43,392 --> 00:15:47,633
and just making sure we had a diverse rainbow of flesh tones.

288
00:15:48,493 --> 00:15:51,194
This makes it really nice when you're actually building your character

289
00:15:51,234 --> 00:15:55,154
to quickly identify, like, oh, here's some nice colors that I want to look at.

290
00:15:55,315 --> 00:15:58,515
And I think Leighton went through and just kind of picked.

291
00:16:00,137 --> 00:16:03,100
I think every color in Dream Daddy is a beautiful color,

292
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,801
and you can make a beautiful dad with it.

293
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:15,068
Overall, we aimed to focus on stylization over realism.

294
00:16:15,348 --> 00:16:18,690
We didn't want our players to build an exact replica

295
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,310
of themselves.

296
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,651
We wanted them to build a cool dad Sona

297
00:16:21,691 --> 00:16:23,291
that they could identify with.

298
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:27,533
Our goal was for people to self-identify and express

299
00:16:27,573 --> 00:16:28,033
themselves.

300
00:16:28,313 --> 00:16:31,134
So even though you can't tweak the focal distance

301
00:16:31,174 --> 00:16:34,155
between eyeballs or jowl depth, you

302
00:16:34,176 --> 00:16:36,476
can build a dad who looks cool.

303
00:16:44,401 --> 00:16:47,242
And that, I think, is probably one of the most effective uses

304
00:16:47,282 --> 00:16:49,043
of a character creator, saying, hey,

305
00:16:49,503 --> 00:16:51,964
this is a cool version of myself or something

306
00:16:52,004 --> 00:16:53,285
I aspire to be on screen.

307
00:16:54,926 --> 00:16:55,386
That's fun.

308
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:01,048
Our next thing is fill in the blanks.

309
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:06,679
After announcing Dream Daddy online, before it came out,

310
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,462
there was a lot of excitement on the internet.

311
00:17:08,582 --> 00:17:09,864
People talked about it all the time.

312
00:17:10,385 --> 00:17:13,109
But there were also a few questions that came up.

313
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,011
Frequently, this was one.

314
00:17:15,031 --> 00:17:17,235
I saw this a lot of.

315
00:17:18,242 --> 00:17:24,369
on Twitter. How do all of these gay dads have kids? And I think the expectation of the person

316
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:30,816
asking this was usually to try and offer a counterpoint of like, this game's not possible

317
00:17:30,836 --> 00:17:35,701
because gay dads can't have kids. And that's silly.

318
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,440
It's not 1999.

319
00:17:38,981 --> 00:17:41,682
There's tons of avenues for gay couples to become parents.

320
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,744
And with Dream Daddy, we, of course,

321
00:17:44,884 --> 00:17:46,084
wanted to cater to that.

322
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,646
If you've not played the game, Amanda

323
00:17:49,786 --> 00:17:51,087
is your dad's son's daughter.

324
00:17:51,467 --> 00:17:53,408
And one of the ways we wanted to answer this question

325
00:17:53,508 --> 00:17:56,230
was to have the player answer it for themselves.

326
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,331
We're not in the business of telling you

327
00:17:58,791 --> 00:17:59,712
exactly how you're going to play.

328
00:18:00,232 --> 00:18:03,774
We want you to feel represented and included.

329
00:18:04,816 --> 00:18:08,097
So of course, the first answer is Amanda could be adopted,

330
00:18:09,178 --> 00:18:11,118
or she could be birthed by a surrogate,

331
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:15,620
or birthed by a partner, like a cis-female one.

332
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,281
Perhaps your dead sona is bisexual

333
00:18:17,421 --> 00:18:18,801
or previously had a female partner.

334
00:18:19,962 --> 00:18:22,262
Maybe it took them longer to come to terms

335
00:18:22,322 --> 00:18:23,223
with their sexuality.

336
00:18:23,763 --> 00:18:26,084
There's a lot of history and reasons why.

337
00:18:27,514 --> 00:18:29,095
A gay man might have a child.

338
00:18:29,355 --> 00:18:32,617
It could also be that your daughter was born by you

339
00:18:32,757 --> 00:18:37,141
if you are a trans male, or born by a partner

340
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:37,961
who's a trans male.

341
00:18:38,842 --> 00:18:43,225
There are a lot of ways that couples can have children.

342
00:18:43,946 --> 00:18:45,927
And we wanted to cater to all of them.

343
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,950
Some of these, though, start to bring

344
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:52,572
in the question of a character, or your dad,

345
00:18:52,592 --> 00:18:54,854
Sona's sexual orientation.

346
00:18:54,894 --> 00:18:55,194
Because...

347
00:18:56,893 --> 00:18:59,215
just because your dad is dating other dads,

348
00:18:59,235 --> 00:19:01,737
that does not mean we should assume your dad, Sona, is gay.

349
00:19:02,237 --> 00:19:06,261
But we also kind of want to know if your dad is gay, bi,

350
00:19:06,321 --> 00:19:08,763
pansexual, sapiosexual, or heterosexual,

351
00:19:08,783 --> 00:19:11,165
who is maybe coming to new realizations.

352
00:19:12,406 --> 00:19:14,888
We wanted to make sure that, canonically, there

353
00:19:14,908 --> 00:19:17,150
was a way for the player to represent

354
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,691
their diverse stories.

355
00:19:19,672 --> 00:19:20,573
This was important to us.

356
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,901
Pretty quickly, when you start matching these up,

357
00:19:25,001 --> 00:19:26,222
some of them are interlinked.

358
00:19:26,842 --> 00:19:29,904
These options can turn into a complex decision tree

359
00:19:29,964 --> 00:19:31,865
with lots of edge cases.

360
00:19:33,326 --> 00:19:36,788
As I mentioned before, we had a small budget.

361
00:19:37,728 --> 00:19:37,908
Poor.

362
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:40,450
This tree looks very expensive.

363
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,851
It would be nice to cater to and have specific stories

364
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:44,952
for every single case.

365
00:19:47,774 --> 00:19:48,435
We couldn't do that.

366
00:19:48,996 --> 00:19:51,139
So we had to ask ourselves, how do we

367
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:53,422
allow people to explore this without getting

368
00:19:53,462 --> 00:19:54,303
into a crazy tree?

369
00:19:56,186 --> 00:19:58,089
Or worse, doing something like this.

370
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,673
How many people have fun filling out one of these?

371
00:20:03,255 --> 00:20:04,397
Okay, one person. Great.

372
00:20:06,979 --> 00:20:08,161
Now, let me ask you this.

373
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:11,184
Can you imagine filling out one of these for sexual preferences?

374
00:20:11,504 --> 00:20:14,167
I think it's already kind of awkward enough just for race,

375
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:17,831
but I imagine that getting into the nitty gritty of something like this

376
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:21,535
is even more awkward, and that's not necessarily an experience

377
00:20:21,635 --> 00:20:22,917
we want our player to have.

378
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:27,100
this also can become technically complex.

379
00:20:28,001 --> 00:20:29,862
And it doesn't make sense narratively

380
00:20:29,942 --> 00:20:31,642
to all of a sudden have a questionnaire

381
00:20:31,682 --> 00:20:33,303
at the end of your character creator of like,

382
00:20:33,543 --> 00:20:35,684
hey, what's your sexual orientation?

383
00:20:35,704 --> 00:20:37,225
How's your daughter here?

384
00:20:37,265 --> 00:20:37,766
Fill us in.

385
00:20:38,966 --> 00:20:42,068
And we obviously don't want to make people feel categorized.

386
00:20:44,663 --> 00:20:46,645
The answer was narrative choices.

387
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:51,911
We realized that it doesn't actually,

388
00:20:53,373 --> 00:20:56,136
we don't need to know your exact sexual orientation,

389
00:20:56,196 --> 00:20:58,719
we don't need to know Amanda's exact status

390
00:20:58,779 --> 00:21:01,322
of if she was born from surrogate or was adopted.

391
00:21:04,295 --> 00:21:10,919
born by you, but by making our questions part of the narrative and making the questions

392
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:18,564
about Amanda and your relationship, we were able to, and keeping the questions simple,

393
00:21:19,084 --> 00:21:23,847
it leaves the door open for a lot of scenarios, and it keeps you involved in your universe

394
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:25,188
of Dream Daddy.

395
00:21:25,268 --> 00:21:26,028
So we don't.

396
00:21:27,395 --> 00:21:30,516
deny a player's existence, we keep it open.

397
00:21:30,676 --> 00:21:33,537
This allows us to acknowledge the player's preferences

398
00:21:33,557 --> 00:21:35,497
without forcing them into a category.

399
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:40,579
So instead, we ask you, what was your ex-partner?

400
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,400
Did you call them father or mother?

401
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,761
Or did Amanda call them father or mother?

402
00:21:46,161 --> 00:21:49,162
And we also ask you, you tell Amanda a story,

403
00:21:49,342 --> 00:21:51,503
and if it was a story about when she was born

404
00:21:51,703 --> 00:21:52,843
or when she was adopted.

405
00:21:54,024 --> 00:21:54,524
We do this.

406
00:21:55,524 --> 00:21:58,685
rather than in a questionnaire, in the actual game.

407
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:01,425
So we use a narrative where you are looking

408
00:22:01,465 --> 00:22:02,946
through a series of old photographs,

409
00:22:04,046 --> 00:22:06,986
and you go through and you basically tell Amanda

410
00:22:07,086 --> 00:22:08,727
a series of stories about each photograph,

411
00:22:09,047 --> 00:22:11,567
which helps us build your character's past.

412
00:22:12,328 --> 00:22:14,108
I think this is ultimately more effective

413
00:22:14,368 --> 00:22:18,549
in creating your dad's sona's canon.

414
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:21,649
than just filling out a questionnaire.

415
00:22:21,969 --> 00:22:24,150
And also it lends to some, I think,

416
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,670
really beautiful and fun moments with Amanda,

417
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:29,651
where it kind of brings you to this area

418
00:22:29,671 --> 00:22:30,791
of being a little sentimental

419
00:22:30,831 --> 00:22:32,231
and going through some old photographs

420
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,872
with your daughter, who you love very much

421
00:22:34,932 --> 00:22:35,652
and want to protect.

422
00:22:38,452 --> 00:22:38,672
So,

423
00:22:41,953 --> 00:22:43,833
next we have number three.

424
00:22:44,934 --> 00:22:47,194
Enable your team with tools.

425
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:56,883
This is, I think, very important if you are like me and like a white guy who's non-diverse.

426
00:22:57,804 --> 00:23:03,407
Something you can do is if you are in a position of leadership is make sure you're striving

427
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:07,689
as best as possible to make sure that everyone is heard and enable everyone on your team

428
00:23:08,229 --> 00:23:13,892
to have access to creating and participating in the overall narrative and story of your

429
00:23:13,932 --> 00:23:14,132
game.

430
00:23:15,313 --> 00:23:17,135
With Dream Daddy, we had an evolving story

431
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:18,696
that was regularly changing.

432
00:23:19,277 --> 00:23:22,680
And if we were building Dream Daddy using a node-based visual

433
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,522
novel tool like Twine or Yarn or Fungus,

434
00:23:26,523 --> 00:23:27,824
we wouldn't necessarily have been

435
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,746
able to explore our character development

436
00:23:30,767 --> 00:23:32,748
and make changes to the game simultaneously

437
00:23:32,788 --> 00:23:34,590
with our teeny weeny budget.

438
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:37,252
Because the writers, Leighton and Vernon,

439
00:23:37,553 --> 00:23:38,594
would write something, and then we'd

440
00:23:38,634 --> 00:23:41,216
have to bring it into an engine and like,

441
00:23:42,056 --> 00:23:49,440
translate things and then add scripting for characters sliding across and actions and changing their expressions.

442
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,602
Our writers would have been locked into time restraints with traditional dating sim tools,

443
00:23:54,483 --> 00:23:57,124
and whatever they wrote would have required extra build time.

444
00:23:57,224 --> 00:23:58,685
So this kind of sucks.

445
00:23:58,965 --> 00:24:03,467
But I found this really cool tool called Ink.

446
00:24:06,934 --> 00:24:07,734
I highly recommend it.

447
00:24:07,874 --> 00:24:10,235
It's super easy to use, kind of.

448
00:24:10,655 --> 00:24:12,435
I think Leighton sometimes has some,

449
00:24:13,095 --> 00:24:14,616
she had some problems with it crashing once,

450
00:24:14,716 --> 00:24:16,516
but that's fine, we figured it out.

451
00:24:16,936 --> 00:24:18,116
For the most part, it's a great tool.

452
00:24:18,616 --> 00:24:22,017
And it allowed our writers to have direct control of the game.

453
00:24:23,518 --> 00:24:25,138
The only problem is it was geared

454
00:24:25,258 --> 00:24:27,738
towards text-based games specifically,

455
00:24:28,038 --> 00:24:29,339
and we were building a visual novel.

456
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:33,400
So, we created a tool called the DDML.

457
00:24:34,657 --> 00:24:39,420
compiler. This is the Dream Daddy markup language compiler. It's based on an altered version

458
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:46,464
of Inc. syntax and it would allow us to generate every single scene in our game based on these

459
00:24:46,504 --> 00:24:50,847
scripts. It was inspired by things like Ruby on Rails, which means you could just hand

460
00:24:50,887 --> 00:24:54,790
it something and plop, there's everything in your scene. All of our animations, facial

461
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:58,612
expressions, eggplants, it would parse through this and figure everything out and build it

462
00:24:58,652 --> 00:25:02,935
for you. Our entire Unity scene was just there. So look at that. Cool.

463
00:25:04,414 --> 00:25:07,255
That got built not by me, but it was generated.

464
00:25:08,756 --> 00:25:14,420
So our project became more agile.

465
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,921
We could iterate through concepts easier

466
00:25:15,941 --> 00:25:17,002
than if we were building Dream Daddy

467
00:25:17,022 --> 00:25:18,222
with the standard visual novel tools.

468
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,164
It allowed our story to keep changing

469
00:25:20,244 --> 00:25:22,405
while still making progress on the rest of the games.

470
00:25:23,226 --> 00:25:25,647
I stress that because diversity was something

471
00:25:25,667 --> 00:25:27,468
we were conscientious of, and that

472
00:25:27,488 --> 00:25:30,250
meant bringing in consultants with diverse points of view

473
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,952
and sexualities to look at our script.

474
00:25:34,689 --> 00:25:37,811
So bring in experts and outside voices.

475
00:25:38,391 --> 00:25:39,491
This is always a good idea.

476
00:25:41,412 --> 00:25:44,533
We brought in lots of consultants,

477
00:25:44,873 --> 00:25:47,594
and it helped Leighton and Vernon know

478
00:25:47,614 --> 00:25:48,474
they were on the right track.

479
00:25:49,055 --> 00:25:51,376
It helped them figure out parts that they maybe were not

480
00:25:51,436 --> 00:25:56,217
happy with to have expert voices and identify things.

481
00:25:57,398 --> 00:26:01,379
Consultants also may have increased our budget, I know.

482
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:02,360
But.

483
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:04,505
I don't think it changed our timeline,

484
00:26:05,086 --> 00:26:07,047
and it was totally worth it, because it got us

485
00:26:07,087 --> 00:26:08,507
to our final product faster.

486
00:26:09,127 --> 00:26:12,709
By having outside consultants come in and give notes

487
00:26:12,769 --> 00:26:15,690
on our scripts, we were able to get through things faster.

488
00:26:16,651 --> 00:26:19,752
And having the DDML compiler made it easy for us

489
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:22,494
to listen to them and make changes

490
00:26:22,554 --> 00:26:24,114
based on their suggestions.

491
00:26:25,675 --> 00:26:31,337
Also, one of our consultants for the game happened to be this like kinda popular famous

492
00:26:31,397 --> 00:26:31,878
musician.

493
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:38,320
He's a gay man who loves dads, if you follow his Twitter.

494
00:26:39,741 --> 00:26:42,002
And he came in and checked out Dream Daddy.

495
00:26:42,902 --> 00:26:44,984
And he really, really loved it.

496
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:49,806
And as a result of doing this, he went home

497
00:26:49,886 --> 00:26:52,528
and he wrote the theme song for Dream Daddy

498
00:26:52,608 --> 00:26:53,689
because he loved it so much.

499
00:26:54,669 --> 00:26:55,870
And this would have never happened

500
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:59,172
if we had not brought him in as a consultant

501
00:26:59,272 --> 00:27:00,753
to consult just on the script in general.

502
00:27:00,793 --> 00:27:01,994
We weren't hiring him as a musician,

503
00:27:02,034 --> 00:27:03,534
we were hiring him for his opinions.

504
00:27:04,895 --> 00:27:08,517
But as like, just synergy, so.

505
00:27:09,653 --> 00:27:14,897
Do it. It's great. Also pay people. We paid our consultants. Don't forget to pay your consultants.

506
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,518
It's important. Their voices are important.

507
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,740
It's going to make everything better. I promise.

508
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:22,541
Okay.

509
00:27:23,702 --> 00:27:25,343
The devils and the details.

510
00:27:26,964 --> 00:27:29,065
Dream Daddy had a problem.

511
00:27:29,766 --> 00:27:32,387
It had gendered pronouns in a lot of places.

512
00:27:32,927 --> 00:27:37,450
And we went through the game. We discovered that sometimes we were using gendered pronouns when we didn't need to.

513
00:27:39,387 --> 00:27:41,408
We wanted to change this, but remember,

514
00:27:41,749 --> 00:27:44,470
our game is on a budget, and doing something like this

515
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:47,852
is totally actually fine and in scope.

516
00:27:47,912 --> 00:27:49,113
It was actually really easy.

517
00:27:49,193 --> 00:27:51,674
If you're not doing this, please start doing it now.

518
00:27:52,035 --> 00:27:54,696
It cost us nothing to be conscientious.

519
00:27:55,016 --> 00:27:56,397
Vernon and Leighton just went through

520
00:27:56,477 --> 00:27:58,798
and tried to remove a lot of gendered pronouns

521
00:27:58,818 --> 00:28:00,059
when referring to groups.

522
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,721
So right now, if you want, you can go through your game

523
00:28:03,781 --> 00:28:05,102
and find, for example,

524
00:28:05,662 --> 00:28:08,824
any place where you use the phrase,

525
00:28:08,864 --> 00:28:11,285
ladies and gentlemen, and try saying something else,

526
00:28:11,425 --> 00:28:15,647
like, treasured guests, fellow humans,

527
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:18,008
good people of Earth.

528
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,842
or even esteemed buttheads.

529
00:28:23,663 --> 00:28:26,263
Regardless, the important thing is this forced us

530
00:28:26,384 --> 00:28:28,144
to think outside of a comfort zone

531
00:28:28,724 --> 00:28:29,905
and think outside of the box.

532
00:28:29,965 --> 00:28:32,586
And the results were that we ended having a lot more fun

533
00:28:33,026 --> 00:28:34,206
and I think richer text

534
00:28:35,287 --> 00:28:37,107
with the dialogue that Ferdinand Leighton wrote.

535
00:28:37,167 --> 00:28:38,468
Like, there's some great stuff in there.

536
00:28:38,868 --> 00:28:41,489
It got us to a better place than if we'd just left it.

537
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:44,830
Okay.

538
00:28:46,951 --> 00:28:47,991
You'll probably make mistakes.

539
00:28:49,857 --> 00:28:51,479
DreamDaddy's not perfect.

540
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:56,084
And if you're not constantly checking things,

541
00:28:56,464 --> 00:28:57,866
even if you are constantly checking things,

542
00:28:58,146 --> 00:28:59,948
things still might fly under the radar.

543
00:29:03,168 --> 00:29:05,810
In the start of the game, here's a mistake we made.

544
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:07,871
In the start of the game, you have the option

545
00:29:07,891 --> 00:29:09,772
of sleeping with Robert the first time you meet him.

546
00:29:10,573 --> 00:29:14,175
If you do this, you unlock an achievement called Bad Dad.

547
00:29:14,895 --> 00:29:18,057
And some players interpret this as us chastising them

548
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:22,360
for expressing their sexuality, when in reality,

549
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,461
we did not mean that at all.

550
00:29:25,241 --> 00:29:30,124
We literally just meant this because Robert's the bad dad.

551
00:29:30,444 --> 00:29:31,725
He's got a leather jacket.

552
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,061
And he likes knives.

553
00:29:37,221 --> 00:29:39,643
So we did not even consider that.

554
00:29:40,423 --> 00:29:41,284
You can't win them all.

555
00:29:42,144 --> 00:29:45,446
And it's not going to be perfect, but please don't let this prevent you from trying.

556
00:29:46,087 --> 00:29:51,210
And please don't let a fear of this prevent you from attempting to make inclusive games.

557
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,550
This might happen.

558
00:29:53,011 --> 00:29:59,995
For instance, be careful with that old, unfinished, never meant to be published thing you might

559
00:30:00,035 --> 00:30:01,716
have left lying around in your code.

560
00:30:03,351 --> 00:30:06,373
It turns out if people really like your game,

561
00:30:06,953 --> 00:30:07,673
they will find it.

562
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:10,595
And they will publish it on the internet.

563
00:30:10,755 --> 00:30:12,396
And they will talk about it like it's canon.

564
00:30:12,756 --> 00:30:14,757
And they will have a lot of opinions and thoughts

565
00:30:14,817 --> 00:30:17,279
on something that maybe wasn't even

566
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:18,379
meant to see the light of day.

567
00:30:18,459 --> 00:30:19,540
We were still figuring it out.

568
00:30:22,982 --> 00:30:23,802
So take a deep breath.

569
00:30:24,723 --> 00:30:26,944
There will be criticism, but this is a good thing.

570
00:30:27,964 --> 00:30:29,645
It will either be something you can change now

571
00:30:29,825 --> 00:30:30,646
or change in the future.

572
00:30:31,146 --> 00:30:31,626
Listen to it.

573
00:30:33,738 --> 00:30:36,919
Fear of imperfection should not prevent you from trying to be inclusive at all.

574
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:37,840
Just go for it.

575
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:43,903
If you get it right, for someone that normally doesn't get a slice of the pie, you've made

576
00:30:43,963 --> 00:30:46,864
progress and I think on the whole, you've done a good thing.

577
00:30:47,064 --> 00:30:50,926
So you may not be able to cater to every single person on earth, but if you manage to do it

578
00:30:50,966 --> 00:30:54,787
for someone who's not normally being catered to, who doesn't normally get to see themselves

579
00:30:54,847 --> 00:30:55,368
represented, A+.

580
00:30:59,382 --> 00:31:00,964
Okay, here's the final thing.

581
00:31:01,104 --> 00:31:02,085
This is an important takeaway.

582
00:31:03,306 --> 00:31:04,547
Four hours of time invested.

583
00:31:05,267 --> 00:31:08,750
And let me see if we can figure out if it was worth it or not.

584
00:31:09,531 --> 00:31:13,114
We included an option in Dream Daddy to do this.

585
00:31:15,776 --> 00:31:16,497
So what this is...

586
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:19,018
is it's a binder.

587
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:21,759
And we wanted to include a binder option

588
00:31:21,859 --> 00:31:24,901
for player characters who wanted to play as a trans male.

589
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:28,923
And this is a way to do that without checking a box

590
00:31:29,243 --> 00:31:30,263
or questioning someone.

591
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:32,464
But it does recognize like, hey.

592
00:31:33,578 --> 00:31:36,940
you might be a man who wears a binder and we want to provide you with that

593
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,102
representation. It took us four hours investment to make this change to our

594
00:31:42,122 --> 00:31:47,684
game. We had assets already. All we had to do was kind of change up some

595
00:31:47,704 --> 00:31:52,987
appearances and like drop it in. We'd kind of already built everything so it

596
00:31:53,027 --> 00:31:59,209
was really easy to do. We were able to do this because we kind of built things out

597
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:01,470
and all we needed to do was just be conscientious of it.

598
00:32:03,987 --> 00:32:06,168
Let's find out if this was worth it or not.

599
00:32:06,448 --> 00:32:07,168
What do you guys think?

600
00:32:08,168 --> 00:32:08,868
All right.

601
00:32:10,349 --> 00:32:12,009
So four hours of investment in time

602
00:32:12,649 --> 00:32:19,351
garnered results like this, and this, and this, and this.

603
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:23,052
As a fat trans man, there's little representation

604
00:32:23,092 --> 00:32:24,632
for me and my brothers in similar body types.

605
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,333
Thank you all so much for this rep.

606
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:30,522
When I saw you could just casually make a Transbinder wearing Dad, I kind of almost cried.

607
00:32:31,222 --> 00:32:34,043
As a gay trans guy, the trans options in the game made me cry.

608
00:32:34,063 --> 00:32:35,003
It was touched.

609
00:32:36,063 --> 00:32:37,924
Thank you for representation, Dream Daddy.

610
00:32:38,544 --> 00:32:39,044
I'm in tears.

611
00:32:39,404 --> 00:32:41,324
Sorry, it was hard to go through and read all of these.

612
00:32:43,685 --> 00:32:44,365
There's a lot.

613
00:32:45,045 --> 00:32:48,686
Canon trans characters and options that make your Dad so into trans literally brought tears

614
00:32:48,726 --> 00:32:49,106
to my eyes.

615
00:32:49,346 --> 00:32:50,607
Literally in tears about Dream Daddy.

616
00:32:52,807 --> 00:32:57,711
This one really means a lot of support that I've never gotten from a game before.

617
00:33:01,134 --> 00:33:03,095
This one. I love this one.

618
00:33:04,276 --> 00:33:06,618
I'm crying. My dad actually looks like me.

619
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:12,123
Thank you so much for having heavier and trans options.

620
00:33:12,743 --> 00:33:14,224
He's a cool dad-ass.

621
00:33:17,187 --> 00:33:17,968
Thank you all very much.

622
00:33:20,494 --> 00:33:21,355
I may have run long.

623
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:23,858
I don't know if there's time for questions.

624
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,401
Nope, there's no time for questions.

625
00:33:26,461 --> 00:33:30,366
So if you have questions, meet me over in the Overlook room

626
00:33:30,726 --> 00:33:31,447
on the second floor.

627
00:33:32,248 --> 00:33:34,891
Thank you all so much for coming and watching me.
