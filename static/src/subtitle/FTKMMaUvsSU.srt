1
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:13,574
Hey everybody. It's 11 o'clock so I'm going to go ahead and kick it off, but we'll wait for some folks to come in as they sort of mill on and we'll go from there.

2
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:16,955
My name's Eli Simmet, thank you so much for taking the time to come today.

3
00:00:17,316 --> 00:00:19,697
Just off the top I wanted to kick off with a few standard reminders.

4
00:00:19,717 --> 00:00:23,739
So if you have phones on, of course, and you need text alerts, meetings to come, feel free to keep looking at them.

5
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:28,461
But if possible, turning them to silent helps anybody else in the audience take notes and focus and absorb the information.

6
00:00:29,122 --> 00:00:31,544
In addition, your badge was scanned as soon as you came in the door today,

7
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:34,085
which means you'll be receiving an email sometime during the day

8
00:00:34,286 --> 00:00:37,948
which contains a survey about how I did, how the talk was, what you feel you learned.

9
00:00:38,028 --> 00:00:41,331
Please definitely fill that out as it helps the conference and it definitely helps me.

10
00:00:42,011 --> 00:00:44,693
So, as I said, my name's Eli and I'm the lead producer

11
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,715
at a small Toronto-based studio by the name of Snowman.

12
00:00:46,835 --> 00:00:49,757
And we'll be talking today, as the sort of intro slide says,

13
00:00:49,797 --> 00:00:52,059
about our creation of the merchandise collection

14
00:00:52,139 --> 00:00:54,240
for one of our flagship titles, Alto's Adventure,

15
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:55,601
and the lessons that we learned,

16
00:00:55,902 --> 00:00:58,243
including not to knock over your water bottle as you swing your hands around.

17
00:00:58,844 --> 00:01:03,226
So, I think, for me, what I'd really love for anybody in the audience is that by the

18
00:01:03,246 --> 00:01:07,149
end of this talk I hope that if you're a producer, a designer, an artist, a merchandiser, anyone

19
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:11,611
at your company that's interested in or curious about merchandise for your game, you leave

20
00:01:11,651 --> 00:01:14,953
feeling like you know a little bit more about it, you have maybe some wider eyes about what

21
00:01:14,993 --> 00:01:19,016
goes into it, and you realize that there are ultimately a ton of skills and tactics you

22
00:01:19,036 --> 00:01:21,017
can use that don't require any specialized knowledge.

23
00:01:21,537 --> 00:01:25,359
So before we really get into it and get into the Alto Collection, I wanted to, as I said,

24
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:26,860
give you a little bit of info about Snowman.

25
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:31,236
We're a small Toronto-based studio that grew recently to just the size where we felt like

26
00:01:31,256 --> 00:01:34,716
we needed a mission statement, a sort of encapsulation of what we do and who we are.

27
00:01:35,076 --> 00:01:39,017
And we settled on this notion that we like to call ourselves a small studio at the centre

28
00:01:39,077 --> 00:01:40,178
of artful experiences.

29
00:01:40,658 --> 00:01:43,939
What that means is that we like to collaborate and be involved in projects that you might

30
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,479
sit with for a short time, but that sit with you for a longer time after and linger in

31
00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:50,760
your heart and in your mind and feel special to you long after you finish the game.

32
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,163
The games we're most known for, of course, are our flagship titles in the Alto series, Alto's Adventure,

33
00:01:55,203 --> 00:01:57,585
and the recently released Alto's Odyssey, which came out last month.

34
00:01:58,006 --> 00:02:02,369
Though we are collaborating on a really exciting suite of projects coming out well into 2018 and beyond,

35
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:05,632
including titles like Where Cards Fall, Skate City, and Distant.

36
00:02:06,332 --> 00:02:11,036
But the title we'll be focusing on today, of course, is our sort of flagship, most known title, Alto's Adventure,

37
00:02:11,276 --> 00:02:15,659
which released in February of 2015, and for which I was the lead in crafting the game's merchandise.

38
00:02:16,742 --> 00:02:19,423
Before we get into the merchandise though, I want to give anyone who might not know a

39
00:02:19,443 --> 00:02:23,364
sense of what Alto's Adventure is and why we felt it was a game that was special enough

40
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:24,684
to craft merchandise for.

41
00:02:25,484 --> 00:02:28,805
We started working on Alto's Adventure in a collaboration we like to call Team Alto

42
00:02:28,985 --> 00:02:31,766
with an artist and developer in the UK by the name of Harry Nesbitt.

43
00:02:32,306 --> 00:02:36,127
Together with Harry we wanted to craft a game that was designed to encapsulate a feeling.

44
00:02:36,707 --> 00:02:40,668
It sits in the endless runner genre, but our hope was that it would feel more like an escape

45
00:02:40,688 --> 00:02:44,989
to somewhere familiar and cozy and warm and that players could go to it for a few minutes

46
00:02:45,029 --> 00:02:46,349
each day to calm down and relax.

47
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:55,255
The game came out in 2015 and in the three years that have followed, we've been very, very fortunate that it's been downloaded across all of its platforms over 30 million times.

48
00:02:55,375 --> 00:03:04,362
But this isn't, for me, a vanity statistic. It actually sits at the center of one of the very important lessons I'm going to revisit later in the talk that ultimately ended up deceiving us when it comes to merchandise.

49
00:03:04,942 --> 00:03:14,830
So, before we get into the collection itself, I want to set the scene, set the tone, and for anyone that might not know the universe of Alto, play its launch trailer back from February 2015 to immerse you in that game's universe.

50
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,921
but I will first actually do it right.

51
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,182
So Alto's Adventure came out nearly three years ago, or rather just over three years

52
00:05:12,222 --> 00:05:16,944
ago on February 19th, 2015, and what we were most blown away with in the months that followed

53
00:05:16,964 --> 00:05:21,045
the game's release was the way that players identified with it the way we felt about when

54
00:05:21,085 --> 00:05:21,645
we created it.

55
00:05:21,806 --> 00:05:25,867
As not just a game that you played, but for a small amount of time each day, a place that

56
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,508
they went to experience some serenity and some calm.

57
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:31,830
We started to receive fan art, physical mail in some cases,

58
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,453
from players reimagining our characters in ways that we hadn't even envisioned

59
00:05:35,553 --> 00:05:39,835
and letting us know that for them it was something that could help them cope with stress

60
00:05:39,895 --> 00:05:40,876
or in some cases illness.

61
00:05:40,996 --> 00:05:44,578
And this for us was a real signal that there was a universe here

62
00:05:44,618 --> 00:05:47,380
that we wanted to be loving stewards of for many years to come.

63
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,785
And one of the first thoughts we had in crafting an extended universe for this Alto brand

64
00:05:53,005 --> 00:05:55,548
was of course the idea that we might be excited to create merchandise,

65
00:05:55,608 --> 00:06:00,212
that players could feel like they were reaching into the world of the game and pulling that merchandise out of.

66
00:06:00,732 --> 00:06:05,237
But before we really embarked on the road to merchandise, we learned our first hard lesson,

67
00:06:05,617 --> 00:06:07,999
that your game absolutely has to come first.

68
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,682
So as a tiny team then of three people at the time,

69
00:06:11,282 --> 00:06:14,244
making a premium game that was the bulk of our studio's revenue.

70
00:06:14,544 --> 00:06:18,246
We needed to keep the product alive and make sure that as many players as possible

71
00:06:18,366 --> 00:06:19,947
were able to experience Altas Adventure.

72
00:06:20,267 --> 00:06:22,208
So merchandise, which we deeply wanted to do,

73
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:25,229
took a backseat to things like our Android version of the game,

74
00:06:25,249 --> 00:06:28,191
releasing nearly a year after the initial release on iOS,

75
00:06:28,571 --> 00:06:30,552
and a major update known as Zen Mode,

76
00:06:30,592 --> 00:06:32,753
which stripped away all the game's challenges

77
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:37,095
and let players really truly play with sort of no goal or a fail state in mind.

78
00:06:37,395 --> 00:06:39,836
Both of these things ended up being huge boons for the product.

79
00:06:40,157 --> 00:06:42,218
Huge boons to allow our studio to continue to grow,

80
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:45,359
but still continue to get in the way of creating that merchandise.

81
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:48,460
And I think I want to really emphasize here that that's a good thing,

82
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,301
and that's okay.

83
00:06:49,881 --> 00:06:52,022
It's most important to consider merchandise

84
00:06:52,362 --> 00:06:54,163
as an extension of the universe of your game

85
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,104
and a way to bring it into your players' hands

86
00:06:56,144 --> 00:06:57,324
in a special and meaningful way,

87
00:06:57,605 --> 00:06:59,786
not as a replacement for doing that with the game itself.

88
00:07:00,626 --> 00:07:02,947
When we did settle down on the idea of doing merchandise,

89
00:07:02,967 --> 00:07:05,587
I, as a team's producer, was tasked with doing the research

90
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:07,168
on how we might source product,

91
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:08,828
think about what products we might sell,

92
00:07:08,868 --> 00:07:10,129
and ultimately mount the collection.

93
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:12,789
And I came upon two sort of big options

94
00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:15,170
that I feel like sit on one side of the same coin.

95
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,951
The first side of that coin was to do it mostly ourselves

96
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:21,232
with CMS-based platforms like Shopify, Squarespace,

97
00:07:21,272 --> 00:07:23,492
and BigCommerce, platforms that allow you essentially

98
00:07:23,532 --> 00:07:24,993
to list a suite of products online.

99
00:07:25,673 --> 00:07:29,114
process credit card transactions for those products and sell them to your customers.

100
00:07:29,794 --> 00:07:33,075
One thing I didn't realize though at first, as silly as it sounds, is that merchandise

101
00:07:33,135 --> 00:07:34,296
doesn't just appear.

102
00:07:34,816 --> 00:07:37,817
I kind of think I had some subconscious thought when I started on this collection that you

103
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:41,938
press a I want Alto branded t-shirts button and they just sort of appeared somewhere and

104
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:42,899
got sold to customers.

105
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,320
So I think the first thing you really want to do if you're embarking on a solution where

106
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,560
you are really doing it yourself.

107
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,702
is acknowledge up front that there's going to have to be someone on your team

108
00:07:51,102 --> 00:07:53,844
or a task sort of set that's spread across your team

109
00:07:54,184 --> 00:07:57,406
involving researching the act of getting products into players hands.

110
00:07:57,746 --> 00:08:00,788
Let's use that shirt as an example. In the case of a shirt you have to source

111
00:08:00,808 --> 00:08:02,089
what are known as blinks, which are

112
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:05,691
just the raw t-shirts on which a logo or branding will go. And the sourcing

113
00:08:05,731 --> 00:08:06,491
process involves

114
00:08:06,731 --> 00:08:10,293
reaching out to companies, checking on prices, getting those shirts sent to you

115
00:08:10,313 --> 00:08:12,275
so you can touch and feel and wear them and think about

116
00:08:12,515 --> 00:08:15,176
how they might feel on a customer's body and then ultimately

117
00:08:15,737 --> 00:08:18,099
Choose how you're going to dye and brand those shirts.

118
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:21,182
Are you going to use discharge ink, which dyes each thread,

119
00:08:21,222 --> 00:08:22,443
but costs quite a bit more?

120
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,025
Are you going to screen print at the source of creation,

121
00:08:25,085 --> 00:08:27,607
so you don't actually ever have to see the branding process happen,

122
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:30,970
but when the customer purchases, it gets sort of inked on and it's sent out?

123
00:08:31,751 --> 00:08:34,252
All of these things require a ton of research,

124
00:08:34,312 --> 00:08:36,133
but I want to emphasize that this is research

125
00:08:36,394 --> 00:08:38,395
I really didn't have any knowledge of beforehand.

126
00:08:38,675 --> 00:08:41,056
So it's accessible, it's really doable yourself,

127
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,377
but I think you have to really acknowledge going in

128
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:46,619
that you're going to have to master the act of really Googling, essentially.

129
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,541
Thinking of the question you want to ask and asking it in the right way.

130
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:52,842
And the process for that shirt alone can take as much as a month,

131
00:08:53,183 --> 00:08:55,584
and that's one of many products that sit in a collection.

132
00:08:55,624 --> 00:08:58,826
So the time really does need to be allotted up front for a solution like these.

133
00:08:59,869 --> 00:09:02,830
The good thing, though, is that when you start selling that product on a do-it-yourself solution,

134
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:05,272
there's really no sense of profit or revenue share.

135
00:09:05,552 --> 00:09:10,114
There's a standard basic transaction fees, or 2 to 4% per transaction through the credit

136
00:09:10,154 --> 00:09:13,715
card process, but you're keeping the lion's share of the profit for a solution like this.

137
00:09:14,075 --> 00:09:17,777
And more than the upfront profit, you're keeping the lion's share of your brand's ownership.

138
00:09:18,177 --> 00:09:23,003
Shopify, BigCommerce, Squarespace, none of these teams require you to sign over any merchandise rights to them,

139
00:09:23,284 --> 00:09:27,849
which means that if you do a do-it-yourself solution, you have the flexibility to add more products in the future.

140
00:09:27,869 --> 00:09:30,933
So that's something I think is really advantageous if you're an independent creator

141
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:34,457
and someone who wants to really value your brand as it grows over the long term.

142
00:09:35,238 --> 00:09:41,243
But if that upfront work is really just not feasible because of your team size or your desires or your next set of updates you need for the game,

143
00:09:41,504 --> 00:09:44,066
there are the other solutions where you do it sort of mostly with help.

144
00:09:44,566 --> 00:09:48,870
These sit alongside the brands like IM8Bit, WeLoveFine, Fangamer, that I'm sure you all know about,

145
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:52,013
which are known for helping you source and create those products,

146
00:09:52,253 --> 00:09:57,398
and selling them online in their own web stores where they sit alongside other branded products from series that you may know.

147
00:09:58,179 --> 00:10:01,320
The huge advantage here, of course, is you're hands-off for most of this process.

148
00:10:01,641 --> 00:10:04,202
If you're able to reach out and make a deal with a team like this,

149
00:10:04,482 --> 00:10:07,964
you're often having the expertise of a massive staff lent your way,

150
00:10:08,224 --> 00:10:09,845
where they source the products, create them,

151
00:10:09,865 --> 00:10:13,888
and really just get the okay from you on making sure they're what you want for your brand.

152
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:16,029
And then, they do the selling themselves.

153
00:10:16,669 --> 00:10:18,651
By consequence, though, if you choose a solution like this,

154
00:10:18,691 --> 00:10:21,712
you are giving up the lion's share of both the upfront profit

155
00:10:21,993 --> 00:10:23,914
and in some ways the long-term flexibility.

156
00:10:24,534 --> 00:10:28,941
On the upfront profit front, many of these solutions do take between 60 and 80% of each

157
00:10:28,981 --> 00:10:33,228
sale for themselves, giving you sort of a quarterly purse from what's made after that.

158
00:10:33,768 --> 00:10:36,913
And in addition, there's often this concept of category exclusivity.

159
00:10:36,953 --> 00:10:39,257
So if I wanted to make, say, a plush, which we did.

160
00:10:40,018 --> 00:10:41,279
and I did it with one of these teams,

161
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:43,860
it might very well be the case that that plush,

162
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,641
and all plushes in the Alto universe,

163
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:48,023
have right of first refusal for these teams,

164
00:10:48,063 --> 00:10:50,905
meaning what you can make and how you can expand that collection

165
00:10:50,985 --> 00:10:52,146
is limited in some degree.

166
00:10:52,626 --> 00:10:55,448
So it's something to go in with true open eyes

167
00:10:55,748 --> 00:10:57,129
and know that as an independent creator,

168
00:10:57,169 --> 00:10:58,810
you are your brand's hugest advocate,

169
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,471
and everything is negotiable.

170
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:05,457
So what you give up, what contracts you ink, and how much exclusivity you give over your merchandise

171
00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:07,880
really depends on what your net desire is.

172
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,385
Do you want to stay hands-off and see cool things from your game, make it into the hands of players?

173
00:11:12,745 --> 00:11:17,151
Or do you want to really run that process from top to tail and have control over how that grows?

174
00:11:18,697 --> 00:11:22,578
I want to insert a quick caveat here, which is that we make mobile games, primarily,

175
00:11:22,618 --> 00:11:25,659
although we are branching into other platforms, and I don't have all the answers.

176
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:30,701
So, if you're a maker of games for platforms like Xbox One, PS4, and most recently Nintendo Switch,

177
00:11:31,241 --> 00:11:35,382
teams like Limited Run are known for their expertise in bringing these games to physical disk form

178
00:11:35,402 --> 00:11:38,683
in a limited capacity, and this is nothing I have any experience with.

179
00:11:39,203 --> 00:11:43,445
Or, for example, if you have more minor goals of making a one-off product release

180
00:11:43,725 --> 00:11:47,306
of something like 100 to 200 products, and you want to work directly with Etsy artisans,

181
00:11:47,586 --> 00:11:48,366
you can do that as well.

182
00:11:48,827 --> 00:11:52,989
Cotton Bureau there on the right is sort of a known for the similar process as an Etsy artisan

183
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:55,771
But for shirts just a one-run sort of product release

184
00:11:56,131 --> 00:11:59,013
So depending on what the goals are for a merchandise release for you

185
00:11:59,454 --> 00:12:03,436
It really isn't only a choice between someone doing it for you or doing a whole collection yourself

186
00:12:03,716 --> 00:12:06,178
And I'd encourage you to explore the range of options that exist

187
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:13,303
So with all of that out of the way we embarked in the summer of 2016 on creating what we call the Alto collection

188
00:12:14,242 --> 00:12:15,882
Something we were really privileged to have

189
00:12:16,282 --> 00:12:18,883
is a very hands-on, very doting designer and creator

190
00:12:18,943 --> 00:12:20,723
of the series in the form of Harry Nesbitt.

191
00:12:21,164 --> 00:12:23,404
He and I worked together over the course of about six months

192
00:12:23,724 --> 00:12:25,505
to craft and design our product line.

193
00:12:25,965 --> 00:12:28,045
But it's very important to note that if you don't have someone

194
00:12:28,065 --> 00:12:30,466
on your team who's designing these products with you,

195
00:12:30,826 --> 00:12:32,847
you might have to reach out, source someone like that,

196
00:12:32,887 --> 00:12:35,087
and bring them in-house to get to know your brand,

197
00:12:35,127 --> 00:12:36,908
spend some time acclimating to your team,

198
00:12:37,248 --> 00:12:39,529
and really find a way to translate that

199
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:40,689
from game to product.

200
00:12:41,548 --> 00:12:45,650
So Harry and I divided our product line into what we sort of think of as three categories.

201
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:50,791
There are artisan products, which are meant to feel like true, limited-edition pieces of merchandise

202
00:12:51,091 --> 00:12:54,032
come directly from the Alto world that you can't get anywhere else,

203
00:12:54,052 --> 00:12:56,673
and in many cases, can't even get for that long.

204
00:12:57,073 --> 00:12:59,254
So we had two products at this category.

205
00:12:59,294 --> 00:13:03,175
The Alto Touque, which was designed by Harry with a very stringent series of specifications

206
00:13:03,195 --> 00:13:07,076
you can see there on what colors could be used, what fabric should be used, how the tassels should look.

207
00:13:07,596 --> 00:13:10,718
and a run of 100 limited edition felted llamas

208
00:13:10,979 --> 00:13:12,600
that looked like the llamas you saw in the trailer

209
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,921
that you catch as you go down the hill.

210
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:17,564
These products were made with individual organizations, respectively,

211
00:13:17,604 --> 00:13:21,347
and then shipped to what's called a sort of warehousing solution

212
00:13:21,487 --> 00:13:22,728
or a sourcing solution.

213
00:13:23,128 --> 00:13:25,069
We used a sourcing solution by the name of Amplifier,

214
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:26,050
which is based in Texas,

215
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,072
but I encourage you again to do research

216
00:13:28,092 --> 00:13:29,333
for what works in your price range

217
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:31,855
and where you want to ship your products to and from.

218
00:13:32,255 --> 00:13:35,517
The majority of our players, sort of demographically and statistically,

219
00:13:35,618 --> 00:13:36,578
sit in the United States.

220
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:39,441
So we made the conscious decision that if product was shipping out,

221
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:41,643
it would likely be going into the hands of a US purchaser.

222
00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:45,085
Amplifier is a team that stocks your product in their warehouse,

223
00:13:45,446 --> 00:13:48,829
sends it out as soon as it's ordered by hooking into our Shopify solution,

224
00:13:49,249 --> 00:13:52,792
and then manages that process by sending us a bill on a monthly basis.

225
00:13:53,212 --> 00:13:55,674
But there is also the option of taking any product you create

226
00:13:55,895 --> 00:13:57,976
and shipping it directly to your office or to your home.

227
00:13:58,277 --> 00:14:00,438
It really depends on how fast you want to scale up

228
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:03,081
and the long-term vision you have for the brand as a whole.

229
00:14:04,072 --> 00:14:06,792
In the case of our tuks, we made them with a non-government organization by the name

230
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:13,434
of Threads of Peru, which pays local Peruvian artisans in remote villages above market fair

231
00:14:13,474 --> 00:14:17,374
wages to create authentic, ethically sourced products from real alpaca wool.

232
00:14:17,654 --> 00:14:20,395
And we created 50 tuks, the result of which you see there on the left.

233
00:14:20,955 --> 00:14:24,256
In the case of the llamas, we worked with a German needle felter by the name of Annika

234
00:14:24,276 --> 00:14:28,957
Brenner to create that run of 100 llamas and custom brand everything from the stamp that

235
00:14:28,977 --> 00:14:32,478
went on those boxes to the sort of unboxing experience where you're pulling those llamas

236
00:14:32,558 --> 00:14:33,058
out of the snow.

237
00:14:33,858 --> 00:14:36,001
We bolstered this with what we called our bespoke designs,

238
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:38,384
things that could be easily reordered if they needed,

239
00:14:38,724 --> 00:14:40,967
but which also had a sense of care and craftsmanship.

240
00:14:41,368 --> 00:14:44,371
We created a sort of custom set of alto socks in a design

241
00:14:44,391 --> 00:14:46,174
that Harry spent a few weeks with me doing up,

242
00:14:46,574 --> 00:14:49,057
and a series of posters which we called our mountain memories.

243
00:14:49,498 --> 00:14:52,582
We have a photo mode in our game where players can snap and share photos with each other,

244
00:14:52,903 --> 00:14:58,190
and we want to sort of make an ode to them by custom composing screens we felt we would have done if we were in the game ourselves.

245
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:02,496
And here too, we try to embed the tone and the voice of our game in the product,

246
00:15:02,536 --> 00:15:05,300
and I want to sort of emphasize that this is something I strongly suggest.

247
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,301
I think that there's room for a wide swath of merchandise from branded mugs to keychains to stickers

248
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:15,483
But I think the merchandise that has sold best for us as we'll see later in the presentation and that continues to warm fans

249
00:15:15,503 --> 00:15:19,684
The most is the merchandise that feels as if it's speaking to the player in the same way that our game does

250
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,344
So on the belly band of our socks

251
00:15:21,384 --> 00:15:25,806
We say that we hope they stay warm on their next adventure and we try to keep sort of that pleasant loving tone and voice

252
00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:26,706
That we feel the game has

253
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,331
And finally rounding out our collection,

254
00:15:29,371 --> 00:15:31,672
we started a sort of standard fair approach

255
00:15:31,712 --> 00:15:33,874
with shirts and other merchandise you might find

256
00:15:33,954 --> 00:15:35,074
in stores or on racks.

257
00:15:35,415 --> 00:15:36,575
We started with four shirts,

258
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:39,377
branded to look like the colors of our night and day

259
00:15:39,417 --> 00:15:40,318
and weather sequences.

260
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:43,440
And we stocked them in sort of a series of colors

261
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,260
sitting at $25 or 18 on sale.

262
00:15:46,482 --> 00:15:48,764
If it sounds like there's something missing here, you're absolutely right.

263
00:15:48,964 --> 00:15:53,549
One category we have yet to explore, and I think I would strongly encourage anyone to look into as well,

264
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:55,170
are true impulse purchases.

265
00:15:55,591 --> 00:15:59,795
Things that cost players between $5 and $10, and don't actually cost that much to make.

266
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,817
Stickers, buttons, die-cast pins...

267
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:05,381
One thing to really keep in mind when you're exploring these products though,

268
00:16:05,742 --> 00:16:12,110
is that the bottom line on a true impulse purchase is often a little risky or at least a little less advantageous.

269
00:16:12,451 --> 00:16:19,040
The cost to source, create, ship and sell stickers often leaves you with something like a 50 cent to one dollar profit on each sale,

270
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:19,560
which...

271
00:16:20,201 --> 00:16:21,662
ultimately shouldn't be your only angle,

272
00:16:21,702 --> 00:16:23,403
but if it's something that's important to you in your team,

273
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:24,783
it's something you should keep in mind.

274
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:28,706
And for us, the ethos of Alto as a well-crafted, beautiful game

275
00:16:28,726 --> 00:16:31,587
that we feel sort of sat above in the genre

276
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:33,668
was one that lent itself to a collection that

277
00:16:33,968 --> 00:16:36,610
was a little more dotingly crafted, but ultimately

278
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,470
a little more expensive.

279
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,592
And that's really what I'm sure a ton of you are curious about,

280
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:41,732
so we'll get into that right now.

281
00:16:42,413 --> 00:16:44,574
This is the cost breakdown for the first run

282
00:16:44,634 --> 00:16:45,434
of the Alto collection.

283
00:16:46,115 --> 00:16:48,255
Our tux, our lamas, our socks, our prints, our shirts,

284
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:50,996
giving us roughly 750 pieces of merchandise,

285
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:52,677
or something a little more than that,

286
00:16:52,977 --> 00:16:55,337
sat at $16,000 US approximately,

287
00:16:55,737 --> 00:16:57,838
with a projected profit potential of $35,000.

288
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,879
And this is something I think I really want to sit on

289
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,799
for a second and starkly contrast against

290
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,540
that 30 million player base I floated,

291
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,560
that lovely metric everyone loves to talk about.

292
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,961
Because for a brand that we felt was beloved and valued,

293
00:17:10,221 --> 00:17:12,002
the profit potential wasn't in the tens,

294
00:17:12,302 --> 00:17:13,362
or sorry, rather, hundreds or,

295
00:17:13,922 --> 00:17:16,603
thousands of dollars or millions, it really was the low tens of thousands.

296
00:17:16,843 --> 00:17:19,704
And I think you need to consider that when you're selling merchandise,

297
00:17:20,145 --> 00:17:23,206
doing it as a purely profit-driven endeavor is something that

298
00:17:23,706 --> 00:17:26,807
ultimately might not be a success because when it comes to selling

299
00:17:26,827 --> 00:17:29,848
merchandise for games especially, the game is your primary business.

300
00:17:30,428 --> 00:17:32,069
That caveat there too is really important.

301
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:35,190
Every bit of the cost you see here excludes time investment

302
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,210
on the part of myself, working during the peak

303
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,751
of the collection's creation between four and five days

304
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,371
a week on it, Harry's time and effort helping me design

305
00:17:42,391 --> 00:17:44,192
and craft the products, and even the effort

306
00:17:44,252 --> 00:17:46,492
of our in-house artist and photographer, Matthias,

307
00:17:46,712 --> 00:17:48,993
on creating the composed product photos

308
00:17:49,013 --> 00:17:50,033
you see online in our store.

309
00:17:50,413 --> 00:17:52,774
And with that in mind, you really ultimately

310
00:17:52,814 --> 00:17:55,094
get down to a very slim margin of profit

311
00:17:55,294 --> 00:17:57,535
that is realized over a long period of time.

312
00:17:57,915 --> 00:17:59,255
And that's another important point when

313
00:17:59,275 --> 00:18:00,155
you're crafting merchandise.

314
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:05,477
This $35,000 was what we could possibly make if every item in our collection sold out.

315
00:18:05,777 --> 00:18:08,697
And that's something you have to consider when investing a large amount of money up front,

316
00:18:08,997 --> 00:18:10,538
that if you're going to realize profit,

317
00:18:11,018 --> 00:18:15,019
in the case of a team that isn't Nintendo, that isn't snapping their fingos and putting, you know,

318
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:17,739
branded merchandise in department stores across the country,

319
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:21,220
you really have to assume that that profit will be realized over a longer period of time.

320
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:26,245
So, from the summer of 2016 to about the late fall of that year,

321
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:28,827
we spent the time crafting the products, building the store,

322
00:18:29,048 --> 00:18:30,409
and mounting it online with Shopify.

323
00:18:30,769 --> 00:18:33,432
And what we resulted in was sort of an Alto collection

324
00:18:33,452 --> 00:18:36,755
which we felt clean and sleek and minimalist in the same way that the game was.

325
00:18:37,035 --> 00:18:40,259
And I strongly encourage you, if you are taking the do-it-yourself approach,

326
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:42,361
to try to associate each product with a feeling,

327
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:45,968
or a slogan or something that really sells it in one image.

328
00:18:46,349 --> 00:18:49,256
And I think doing that across your store is a great way to draw players in

329
00:18:49,597 --> 00:18:53,325
and draw people into exactly what they'll feel when they touch and hold this product.

330
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:57,703
And what's really exciting here is that, while as game creators and, you know, independent

331
00:18:57,723 --> 00:19:01,407
designers and developers, we're often dependent on the whims of curated storefronts like Google

332
00:19:01,427 --> 00:19:05,692
Play and the App Store, we get to be our own curated storefront when we're selling merchandise.

333
00:19:05,992 --> 00:19:09,636
And so I think taking that time to editorialize is also really exciting.

334
00:19:09,656 --> 00:19:13,059
And in the case of our two here, and many of our products, but especially this one.

335
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,362
We wanted to dive deep into the actual creation process.

336
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:19,244
And I think what really delighted players and delighted fans

337
00:19:19,304 --> 00:19:21,026
when we launched our store was the sense

338
00:19:21,046 --> 00:19:22,607
that each product had a story to it

339
00:19:22,867 --> 00:19:25,549
and that that story was linked inexorably to the feeling

340
00:19:25,569 --> 00:19:26,430
of owning the product.

341
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,993
So we launched in November of 2016,

342
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,795
November 25th specifically, trying

343
00:19:32,815 --> 00:19:36,157
to target the holiday Black Friday shopping craze.

344
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,179
And I think that's also something very important

345
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:38,939
to take into account.

346
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:42,552
We're all told not to launch our sweet little indie mobile game on the same day as a Call

347
00:19:42,592 --> 00:19:42,892
of Duty.

348
00:19:43,232 --> 00:19:45,733
And I think the same rule applies when you're launching merchandise.

349
00:19:46,174 --> 00:19:49,315
You want to take into account the trends of the market, when people are at their sort

350
00:19:49,335 --> 00:19:53,637
of shopping best, and try to target releases, even if it might result in a small artificial

351
00:19:53,677 --> 00:19:56,478
delay around when people are most interested in merch.

352
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:58,820
And our launch months were really exciting.

353
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,021
We burst right out of the gate, and this

354
00:20:01,081 --> 00:20:03,202
represents the November, December sales leading up

355
00:20:03,342 --> 00:20:05,483
just to the new year for the Alto collection.

356
00:20:05,723 --> 00:20:07,223
As a small indie team that wasn't looking

357
00:20:07,263 --> 00:20:09,024
to shatter the earth with our merchandise collection,

358
00:20:09,284 --> 00:20:10,985
we were very optimistic here.

359
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:13,826
125 orders right out of the gate for a total net sale of $6,200.

360
00:20:14,707 --> 00:20:18,048
An average order price of $50, which is really exciting,

361
00:20:18,088 --> 00:20:20,810
because that told us that the love we thought fans might have

362
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:23,231
for this Alto universe held true when they went to purchase

363
00:20:23,271 --> 00:20:24,811
something in our store, and that to them,

364
00:20:24,851 --> 00:20:27,172
this was a brand that was worth a high amount of that sort

365
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:27,873
of value to them.

366
00:20:28,213 --> 00:20:29,715
and a peak sales day of around $1,500.

367
00:20:30,055 --> 00:20:34,521
And at this rate, I feel like I kind of was ready to kick back, relax,

368
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,584
pour myself a glass of wine because I'd done it.

369
00:20:36,924 --> 00:20:40,609
At this sort of profit rate, I was going to break even in three or four months max.

370
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:41,590
Right?

371
00:20:42,811 --> 00:20:44,854
Except that's not exactly how it happened.

372
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:49,358
What you're seeing here are the ensuing six months of the store's collection.

373
00:20:49,758 --> 00:20:53,979
Definitely some post-launch, sort of stomach-sinking feeling for us.

374
00:20:54,499 --> 00:21:00,021
Over the six months that ensued, we sold roughly 16 products, or 16 orders rather,

375
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:07,944
for a total sale of $790, and a peak sales day of one-tenth the peak sales day of our previous period.

376
00:21:08,444 --> 00:21:10,426
for an average order price of $49.

377
00:21:10,806 --> 00:21:13,188
And it was this last point that kept us optimistic

378
00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:15,210
and sort of helped us turn it around.

379
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:17,432
We could tell that fans loved Alto,

380
00:21:17,613 --> 00:21:18,954
and they loved the merchandise they purchased

381
00:21:18,974 --> 00:21:20,896
from the universe and felt it had high value.

382
00:21:21,236 --> 00:21:23,238
But nobody was purchasing anything anymore.

383
00:21:23,758 --> 00:21:24,819
And I think in reflection,

384
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:26,601
this taught us a few key hard lessons

385
00:21:26,621 --> 00:21:27,382
that I want to pass on.

386
00:21:28,002 --> 00:21:29,624
One is that you should never, ever, ever

387
00:21:29,744 --> 00:21:30,665
operate on anic data.

388
00:21:31,025 --> 00:21:35,366
And when it comes to the sale of merchandise, even the sales of your game are annexed data.

389
00:21:35,626 --> 00:21:40,207
The fact that we had 30 million players across our platforms didn't in any tangible or meaningful way

390
00:21:40,447 --> 00:21:44,108
mean that we had 30 million merchandise purchasers across all of the Alto brand.

391
00:21:44,488 --> 00:21:49,969
And that love here, that second point, that love does not equal any sort of tangible sales guarantee.

392
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,310
Players emailing us by the hundreds, telling us they'd buy merchandise if they could,

393
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,070
or they'd really love to buy a plush llama,

394
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:58,671
aren't necessarily going to have their feet held to the fire when the time comes, and nor should they.

395
00:21:59,071 --> 00:22:04,393
It's not the player's responsibility to buy a thing from a game that they just happen to like.

396
00:22:04,713 --> 00:22:09,635
And I think we convinced ourselves a little that it would be, and they'd sort of embrace it in the same way we would,

397
00:22:09,655 --> 00:22:12,776
and that our love for the brand and the collection would be their love.

398
00:22:13,216 --> 00:22:16,657
And I think it's this last point that really, really sort of makes the difference.

399
00:22:17,277 --> 00:22:19,298
Time and distance ultimately trumped for us,

400
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,418
and I think trumped for anything,

401
00:22:20,438 --> 00:22:22,179
a sense of craftsmanship and quality.

402
00:22:22,439 --> 00:22:23,680
And this functions in two ways.

403
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,960
So it had been about a year and a half

404
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,341
since Alto's Adventure had launched

405
00:22:27,561 --> 00:22:29,242
before we were able to launch our merch collection.

406
00:22:29,282 --> 00:22:31,122
That, as I mentioned, is because our game came first

407
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:32,543
and should always come first.

408
00:22:32,863 --> 00:22:34,423
But I don't think we readily acknowledged

409
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:36,504
how much that year and a half created

410
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:39,025
a sort of distance for the most die-hard players

411
00:22:39,265 --> 00:22:40,466
from the love for our brand.

412
00:22:40,866 --> 00:22:43,547
But most importantly, there was a ton of friction and distance

413
00:22:43,767 --> 00:22:46,068
for the actual act of purchasing a thing to begin with.

414
00:22:46,628 --> 00:22:50,934
So, before you even bought something from the Alto Collection, you had to put down the game, if you were playing it,

415
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:54,018
visit us on social media, where we, I guess, hoped you were following us,

416
00:22:54,638 --> 00:22:59,465
look at our web link, find our web store, go through a product, click on add to...

417
00:22:59,525 --> 00:23:01,367
I mean, it's boring already, I'm falling asleep just saying it.

418
00:23:01,687 --> 00:23:05,132
So, I think the realities are that at every point of that process...

419
00:23:05,572 --> 00:23:09,095
Players could get a call, decide they were hungry, get bored,

420
00:23:09,335 --> 00:23:11,056
realize an $18 sock was a rip-off.

421
00:23:11,396 --> 00:23:14,878
Anything that they felt in their minds or guts wasn't worth it

422
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:18,721
or was better use of their time got in the way of that purchase process.

423
00:23:19,589 --> 00:23:22,732
So we kind of took things back to square one, I think,

424
00:23:22,972 --> 00:23:24,934
thought a little bit about sort of taking our licks,

425
00:23:24,954 --> 00:23:26,636
and ultimately were ready to just assume

426
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:27,917
that the collection was a lost leader

427
00:23:27,997 --> 00:23:29,238
where profit is concerned,

428
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:31,500
but that it was a worthwhile fan investment

429
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,441
for the love of the brand

430
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,142
and for sort of an ode to our players.

431
00:23:34,523 --> 00:23:35,404
What came next, though,

432
00:23:35,484 --> 00:23:36,865
taught us a few really exciting lessons

433
00:23:36,885 --> 00:23:38,166
that I'm very optimistic about.

434
00:23:39,006 --> 00:23:44,409
The Alto gift shop is sort of the next phase of our Alto merchandising sort of journey, I think.

435
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:47,090
And for us, this happened in around March of 2017,

436
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:51,833
when we were approached by our platform partner Shopify, where we were sort of running the store,

437
00:23:52,113 --> 00:23:56,135
and they had for us sort of a debut prospect that they wanted us to consider.

438
00:23:56,435 --> 00:24:00,557
They had what they called the Unity Buy SDK, which was an experimental early prototype

439
00:24:00,577 --> 00:24:03,859
of a way that you could essentially wrap your products in a little Unity wrapper.

440
00:24:04,199 --> 00:24:06,420
put them into your game, provided you sold them on Shopify,

441
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,101
and sell the products you made directly in your game.

442
00:24:09,722 --> 00:24:11,702
And while it sounded exciting, it wasn't an instant yes,

443
00:24:11,782 --> 00:24:13,563
or really even a guarantee for us,

444
00:24:13,623 --> 00:24:15,484
because we'd already invested time and money

445
00:24:15,724 --> 00:24:18,365
in what we thought might have been a loss later on the merchandise front,

446
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,726
so we sat with it for a bit, we talked to our designer,

447
00:24:20,766 --> 00:24:22,907
we evaluated the product, and ultimately decided

448
00:24:23,127 --> 00:24:25,168
that for the time it would take, it was worth at least seeing

449
00:24:25,408 --> 00:24:27,829
if getting the merchandise into the game would have an effect.

450
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:29,910
And what resulted is what we call our gift shop.

451
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:36,755
The Alto Gift Shop is an in-game integration that allows you as a player to visit an area

452
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:38,897
that sits right alongside our in-game workshop.

453
00:24:38,957 --> 00:24:42,459
You enter from the title screen, you press the menu where you go to your workshop to

454
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:45,902
upgrade your digital items, and sitting right alongside that is a little gift shop tab.

455
00:24:46,202 --> 00:24:51,307
where you see listed in a grid in a very familiar visual sort of language that you would in the workshop

456
00:24:51,507 --> 00:24:53,108
the same products we have in our store.

457
00:24:53,449 --> 00:24:57,352
You can click through into those products, view them, select sizes on your shirt,

458
00:24:57,592 --> 00:25:00,575
and visit our cart online where you can pay with Apple Pay

459
00:25:00,955 --> 00:25:04,138
and any other One Touch payment systems you might have, such as Android Pay.

460
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:08,042
And so in that way, it was a way for players to sort of engage with the merch

461
00:25:08,262 --> 00:25:10,043
in that exit-through-the-gift-shop mentality,

462
00:25:10,063 --> 00:25:12,586
where they're seeing the merch inside the universe of the game itself.

463
00:25:13,046 --> 00:25:17,211
We worked on this integration and launched it in June of 2017, or July rather,

464
00:25:17,531 --> 00:25:19,614
and what we saw next was really, really encouraging.

465
00:25:20,054 --> 00:25:22,037
So this was us sort of hitting our stride.

466
00:25:22,597 --> 00:25:26,422
This represents the six months that have followed since the launch of our Alto gift shop,

467
00:25:26,462 --> 00:25:28,384
leading up to just about the month before GDC,

468
00:25:28,565 --> 00:25:30,647
and I have some more data since I've arrived here.

469
00:25:31,107 --> 00:25:36,672
So this is a total of 305 sales with $13,151 in revenue,

470
00:25:37,172 --> 00:25:40,215
and what's perhaps most exciting is this green chart for me,

471
00:25:40,555 --> 00:25:44,418
that there hasn't been really a single day since the launch of the Alto gift shop

472
00:25:44,438 --> 00:25:46,340
where we haven't made at least one sale.

473
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,502
And this functions in a couple of ways.

474
00:25:48,942 --> 00:25:50,684
Not all of these sales are through the gift shop,

475
00:25:50,704 --> 00:25:52,805
though the gift shop has buoyed up those sales,

476
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:56,068
which is telling me that by introducing players to the merchandise

477
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:57,389
inside the world of our game,

478
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:59,050
we've given them a sort of...

479
00:26:00,051 --> 00:26:04,133
lingering memory of it that they take with them and use to visit that shop at a later date.

480
00:26:04,673 --> 00:26:09,175
And the purchase price too has stayed right there just at that almost below $50 level.

481
00:26:09,615 --> 00:26:15,177
With this sort of profit over time, we've just now, about a month before I came,

482
00:26:15,497 --> 00:26:19,399
reached profitability on the collection and are looking on any dollar we make being profit,

483
00:26:19,419 --> 00:26:22,940
which is very exciting, but it isn't the sort of rags to riches story it might sound like,

484
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,061
and I'll talk about this in a sec.

485
00:26:24,661 --> 00:26:27,384
The thing that's most exciting though is this consistency that we're seeing.

486
00:26:27,644 --> 00:26:31,007
This sense that players are finding, accessing and purchasing our merchandise

487
00:26:31,247 --> 00:26:34,610
without any prodding, encouragement or marketing dollar investment from us.

488
00:26:35,351 --> 00:26:40,655
So since the launch of the gift shop, we have 57% of all merch sales coming through the app itself.

489
00:26:41,296 --> 00:26:42,737
And of those sales, the distribution

490
00:26:42,777 --> 00:26:44,419
sits roughly where I think a lot of developers

491
00:26:44,459 --> 00:26:46,680
see the sales for the games themselves.

492
00:26:47,101 --> 00:26:48,021
82% of those are through iOS.

493
00:26:48,762 --> 00:26:49,763
18% are for Android.

494
00:26:50,023 --> 00:26:51,704
What's stark about that Android statistic,

495
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:55,548
though, is that we have an order of magnitude higher

496
00:26:55,608 --> 00:26:57,449
number of Android players for Alto's Adventure

497
00:26:57,709 --> 00:26:59,751
because we chose consciously to experiment

498
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:02,053
with making it a free-to-play SKU on that platform

499
00:27:02,293 --> 00:27:03,914
rather than a $4.99 premium game.

500
00:27:03,974 --> 00:27:05,916
So the fact that Android purchases still

501
00:27:05,976 --> 00:27:09,179
sit at such a lower proportion is very worth noting.

502
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:14,843
Among those who do choose to purchase on iOS, over 90% engage with purchases through Apple Pay,

503
00:27:15,323 --> 00:27:18,365
which tells us that friction was a huge barrier in the way that we thought it was.

504
00:27:19,066 --> 00:27:22,408
And as I mentioned, that purchase price per user has stayed around an average of $40.

505
00:27:23,754 --> 00:27:25,075
So what does this tell us?

506
00:27:25,115 --> 00:27:26,476
What are some of the broader takeaways here?

507
00:27:26,516 --> 00:27:28,538
Like I said, this isn't a rags to riches story.

508
00:27:28,578 --> 00:27:30,520
There really aren't many riches to be found in a

509
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,464
collection that's made a total of $24,000 and $6,000 in

510
00:27:34,504 --> 00:27:36,907
profit, but there are some exciting opportunities and

511
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,729
some lingering lessons for us that I think we're going to

512
00:27:38,769 --> 00:27:39,509
take into the future.

513
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:42,512
So in what is ultimately the biggest example of burying the

514
00:27:42,552 --> 00:27:44,014
lead in any GDC talk in history.

515
00:27:45,015 --> 00:27:48,858
Any sufficiently advanced technology is, as my talks say, indistinguishable from magic.

516
00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:53,903
What you see here are a few tweets of players who are just extra excited to even access the store the day that it launched.

517
00:27:54,203 --> 00:27:58,887
But ultimately what this sort of slogan from the futurist Arthur C. Clarke represents to me is the idea

518
00:27:59,227 --> 00:28:03,071
that if you can make the act of engaging with the merchandise you sell for your game

519
00:28:03,451 --> 00:28:06,673
feel in any way like the act of engaging with the game itself

520
00:28:07,073 --> 00:28:09,695
and capture the same feelings, emotions, and perhaps

521
00:28:09,715 --> 00:28:11,136
a little bit of magic in doing so,

522
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:13,357
you remove a ton of the friction that players

523
00:28:13,437 --> 00:28:14,878
feel when they're trying to think

524
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:16,118
about purchasing your products.

525
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:19,160
And for us, something that really, really sort of was

526
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,002
sold for us, and I think we bet on and that really worked out,

527
00:28:22,402 --> 00:28:24,463
was that merchandise as an extension of your game's

528
00:28:24,523 --> 00:28:26,725
universe is the most exciting merchandise.

529
00:28:27,065 --> 00:28:28,306
This doesn't mean that there isn't room

530
00:28:28,566 --> 00:28:30,867
for branded t-shirts or mugs or simple products that

531
00:28:30,887 --> 00:28:31,688
are more practical.

532
00:28:32,088 --> 00:28:34,310
But I think some of the places we took inspiration from,

533
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,812
like Campo Santo's pulp novel-based notebooks

534
00:28:36,832 --> 00:28:38,694
that you see in the Firewatch Towers around the game,

535
00:28:38,834 --> 00:28:41,096
or the Retro City Rampage Deluxe Edition, which

536
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:44,839
has a set of VR, sorry, 3D glasses, VR, because it's GDC,

537
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,962
3D glasses that you can use to see the actual game in 3D,

538
00:28:49,002 --> 00:28:51,685
feel like they come tangibly from the universe of the game.

539
00:28:52,025 --> 00:28:53,126
And Stardew Valley, of course, has

540
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:55,768
its posters, which you see around the town as you visit.

541
00:28:56,008 --> 00:28:57,890
So these types of merchandise have been far and away

542
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:58,651
our best sellers.

543
00:28:59,091 --> 00:29:02,553
and they've also been the ones that I think have engendered the most player excitement and joy.

544
00:29:03,113 --> 00:29:06,674
And this is a point that I think is most exciting for us as indie creators.

545
00:29:07,475 --> 00:29:11,477
If possible, and this is a very lucky thing to be able to say, so I acknowledge that 100% up front,

546
00:29:11,797 --> 00:29:16,119
you need to go into the creation of merchandise considering the act of making massive profit

547
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,641
or turning it into a whole new leg of your business, a bonus, not the thesis.

548
00:29:21,101 --> 00:29:25,563
And I think there is a ton of goodwill to be gained by having your players engage with the world.

549
00:29:25,823 --> 00:29:29,927
bring it into their world and feel like they own a little bit of that game experience.

550
00:29:30,308 --> 00:29:34,312
But I think ultimately you have to sort of approach the act of creating merchandise with open eyes

551
00:29:34,712 --> 00:29:39,857
and assume that in doing so you are building long-term value for your game and for the universe of your game,

552
00:29:40,258 --> 00:29:44,322
not necessarily making a quick buck, because there are far better ways to do that if that is your goal.

553
00:29:45,439 --> 00:29:47,780
This last point, though, is what I think is the most exciting to me.

554
00:29:48,801 --> 00:29:51,542
Beyond the charts and the numbers, this is kind of a rough look at the lay of the land

555
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:53,143
of an industry that I'm sure you've all heard before.

556
00:29:53,403 --> 00:29:56,505
About $50 billion a year gets spent on games,

557
00:29:56,885 --> 00:29:58,806
you know, subdivided into a small amount of paid,

558
00:29:59,927 --> 00:30:01,288
a larger amount of advertisement,

559
00:30:01,308 --> 00:30:03,729
and almost equal amount of in-app purchases in digital games.

560
00:30:04,089 --> 00:30:07,313
And sitting outside games is this sort of indirect revenue stream.

561
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:10,776
$13 billion last year was spent on toy and collectible merchandise,

562
00:30:11,537 --> 00:30:13,459
in many cases across stores like GameStop,

563
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,823
which are making conscious efforts to rebrand a lot of their locations

564
00:30:16,863 --> 00:30:18,645
to merch primary locations.

565
00:30:19,406 --> 00:30:21,348
This last point, though, is what's particularly stark,

566
00:30:21,368 --> 00:30:23,730
this in-app payment part of the direct revenue for our industry.

567
00:30:24,471 --> 00:30:27,152
As I'm sure you've all heard, 5% of game players

568
00:30:27,212 --> 00:30:29,952
represent that 43% of in-app purchase revenue,

569
00:30:30,192 --> 00:30:32,593
meaning about $22 billion for the industry.

570
00:30:32,993 --> 00:30:36,294
And what this means to me is that besides the whole concept

571
00:30:36,314 --> 00:30:38,514
of the whale, which I think is a bit of a denigrating term,

572
00:30:38,794 --> 00:30:40,335
it really is just telling me that there

573
00:30:40,355 --> 00:30:41,675
are a whole ton of players out there

574
00:30:41,955 --> 00:30:44,536
that feel like beyond the act of playing a game that they love,

575
00:30:44,836 --> 00:30:46,476
there isn't a lot in that game that

576
00:30:46,516 --> 00:30:48,016
has value that's worth investing in,

577
00:30:48,376 --> 00:30:50,677
and that there's a chance to create value for players that

578
00:30:50,777 --> 00:30:52,457
goes beyond the existing ways that we

579
00:30:52,497 --> 00:30:54,258
think of monetizing the things that we make.

580
00:30:54,878 --> 00:30:58,822
And I think what we've learned, even in small part, from selling our Alto collection, is

581
00:30:58,842 --> 00:31:03,205
that there's a chance to sort of in any way reshape the future by bringing some of that

582
00:31:03,545 --> 00:31:07,469
indirect revenue directly into the world of your game, and not only getting to do that,

583
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:12,353
but getting to control how it feels to players, and to sort of ensure that when players experience

584
00:31:12,373 --> 00:31:16,056
your merchandise, they experience it just the way you want, in the same way you would

585
00:31:16,076 --> 00:31:17,217
want them to for your game itself.

586
00:31:18,192 --> 00:31:21,813
And I want to return now to sort of the thesis lesson that we learned when we first embarked

587
00:31:21,914 --> 00:31:26,396
on this road to merchandise, which is that your game really, really has to come first.

588
00:31:26,956 --> 00:31:31,078
I plan to come today with some learnings that we sort of absorbed from taking our licks,

589
00:31:31,479 --> 00:31:35,461
forgetting to make merchandise for a little too long, and then sort of turning around

590
00:31:35,501 --> 00:31:38,782
by creating merchandise at the launch of our newest game, Alto's Odyssey, to tell you about

591
00:31:38,822 --> 00:31:39,923
how that collection fared.

592
00:31:40,303 --> 00:31:40,403
But...

593
00:31:41,124 --> 00:31:47,032
In the last month stretch of making that game, we had to choose between making it free of bugs or making it with merchandise.

594
00:31:47,453 --> 00:31:54,964
And we ultimately chose that the best and most important thing we could do for the world of Alto and for any future merchandise we sell associated with our game was to focus on that game.

595
00:31:56,025 --> 00:32:00,247
what I would sort of encourage you to do is continue to focus on crafting beautiful things

596
00:32:00,287 --> 00:32:03,609
that matter to you and hopefully matter to the players that play the things you make.

597
00:32:03,969 --> 00:32:08,391
But that thinking of merchandise as a way to extend that universe, bring it into players'

598
00:32:08,431 --> 00:32:12,092
hands and trying to find ways, whether it's through an integration like the one we used

599
00:32:12,132 --> 00:32:16,434
or something you rig up on your own, to get players access to that merchandise in a way

600
00:32:16,454 --> 00:32:20,336
that doesn't require them to sort of go through all of that time and all of that distance.

601
00:32:21,116 --> 00:32:23,017
Thanks everybody for taking the time to come and to listen today.

602
00:32:23,057 --> 00:32:24,077
It's meant a lot to have you.

603
00:32:27,548 --> 00:32:29,489
I know we're like super short on time.

604
00:32:29,529 --> 00:32:31,830
It's 11.33 and I've been generously running over time.

605
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,791
I'll look to the back of the room if there's any qualms

606
00:32:33,831 --> 00:32:34,671
with questions.

607
00:32:35,231 --> 00:32:37,392
I have time for maybe a few if anybody would like to ask.

608
00:32:37,412 --> 00:32:39,333
But of course my email's there and if anyone wants to reach

609
00:32:39,393 --> 00:32:42,254
out after taking some time to think and maybe consider a

610
00:32:42,274 --> 00:32:43,115
question there, that's good too.

611
00:32:43,135 --> 00:32:44,895
But I'll hover around for maybe three or four minutes

612
00:32:44,915 --> 00:32:46,016
and see if anyone wants to ask a question.

613
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,097
There are mics right there at the center row that you can

614
00:32:48,117 --> 00:32:48,497
walk up to.

615
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,792
Thank you.

616
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:21,573
Yeah, so for those who didn't hear the question was, maybe we've touched on it before, but are we planning to do the same experience for Odyssey?

617
00:33:21,613 --> 00:33:27,015
We definitely have in-motion plans to create a merchandise collection for Odyssey, they're happening behind the scenes right now.

618
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:32,838
I think we wanted to do it day and date, but it was just a small team stretched thin and we had to make the decision that merchandise,

619
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:38,080
while probably the most exciting part of the game for us and one of the most joyful parts because we like to see the things that we make,

620
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,342
had to come second. But we definitely plan on releasing merchandise for Altos Odyssey, yeah.

621
00:33:44,295 --> 00:33:50,588
Curious if you guys have thought about using merchandise as a retention or an advertising

622
00:33:51,049 --> 00:33:52,111
piece of the game, you know?

623
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:59,628
perhaps as a reward for somebody in the game or something like, you know, encouraging stickiness

624
00:33:59,908 --> 00:34:00,089
or...

625
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:00,689
For sure.

626
00:34:01,069 --> 00:34:04,573
And even giving them a free shirt at some point so that they can kind of self-advertise.

627
00:34:04,593 --> 00:34:06,234
Did you guys consider that in your model at all?

628
00:34:06,495 --> 00:34:06,655
Right.

629
00:34:06,675 --> 00:34:10,899
So to repackage in tighter form, the question was, have we thought as a team about potentially

630
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:14,942
integrating merchandise even more tightly, using it as rewards for playing the game and

631
00:34:14,962 --> 00:34:19,086
maybe sort of signing certain milestones in the game to the act of getting discounts or

632
00:34:19,126 --> 00:34:19,807
free merchandise?

633
00:34:20,287 --> 00:34:23,468
I think for us, it's definitely something that's been on our minds,

634
00:34:23,488 --> 00:34:25,869
and it's something I've seen other games do to interesting effect,

635
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,750
but I think what's very important for us is that the games we craft

636
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:32,191
are meant to feel like small worlds you visit for a small amount of time,

637
00:34:32,231 --> 00:34:34,152
and we want those to feel deeply authentic.

638
00:34:34,532 --> 00:34:36,853
And so our gift shop, while not perhaps authentic,

639
00:34:37,153 --> 00:34:37,893
is meant to feel...

640
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:42,536
as close as possible to the idea that you're visiting maybe a small place in Altos village

641
00:34:42,796 --> 00:34:46,058
and purchasing something as you've spent some time there. And I think for us we don't want

642
00:34:46,078 --> 00:34:49,861
to integrate merchandise in a way that will detract from the quality of the act of playing

643
00:34:49,901 --> 00:34:52,482
the game. But I think for the right game it's absolutely an option.

644
00:34:55,488 --> 00:35:03,916
Thanks for the talk. Very fascinating. I was curious, you mentioned this pretty dramatic spread between revenue from iOS versus Android.

645
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:04,176
Sure.

646
00:35:04,617 --> 00:35:10,702
And I was wondering, have you noticed any differences in the products that players are interested in?

647
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:11,843
You know, is it sort of...

648
00:35:12,244 --> 00:35:16,145
You know, this kind of thing is for some reason more popular among iOS players, whereas Android

649
00:35:16,205 --> 00:35:17,166
gravitates toward this.

650
00:35:17,686 --> 00:35:18,166
Great question.

651
00:35:18,186 --> 00:35:23,708
So the question was, in the spread that we're seeing across revenue for iOS and for Android,

652
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:28,010
are we seeing a similar or interestingly unique spread for what's being purchased from those

653
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:29,111
players in our store?

654
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:33,252
And for us, while we're not seeing that, what we are seeing that I want to draw attention to

655
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:36,713
are the regions to which those merchandise items are being purchased.

656
00:35:37,153 --> 00:35:40,294
A disproportionate amount of our overseas shipping goes to Android players

657
00:35:40,835 --> 00:35:44,476
among the shipping that goes for the in-game items, the items purchased in-game.

658
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:47,517
So a lot of the items purchased in-game through our Android integration

659
00:35:47,877 --> 00:35:50,978
are done to Russia, China, Japan, Vietnam,

660
00:35:51,418 --> 00:35:56,240
whereas the disproportionate amount of the iOS purchases go to Canada, the UK, and the United States.

661
00:35:56,925 --> 00:36:00,227
And do you have sort of unsupported countries?

662
00:36:00,287 --> 00:36:05,029
Has it become a problem at all where somebody will order something from, you know, the far corners of the earth

663
00:36:05,089 --> 00:36:08,050
and you have to call them and be like, we actually don't ship there or whatever?

664
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:10,812
That's a great question. So are there any unsupported countries for us?

665
00:36:10,852 --> 00:36:13,913
Have we run into problems where players want to buy a thing, but we can't send a thing?

666
00:36:15,134 --> 00:36:18,976
There haven't, and part of that is that for this particular solution we chose Shopify,

667
00:36:19,216 --> 00:36:22,999
they enable the sort of e-commerce seller to sell worldwide,

668
00:36:23,379 --> 00:36:25,901
and we've, our shipping solution in the form of Amplify,

669
00:36:25,921 --> 00:36:28,283
or the warehouse solution we chose, also supports that,

670
00:36:28,543 --> 00:36:31,305
but it's absolutely a thing that as a merchandise creator you have to consider.

671
00:36:31,605 --> 00:36:35,628
Because, for example, if you've chosen as somebody to not pay a warehousing solution,

672
00:36:35,648 --> 00:36:37,649
and stock your merch in your house or in your office,

673
00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:41,071
you're only going to be able to ship where you've set up the capacity to do so,

674
00:36:41,091 --> 00:36:42,252
and have the bandwidth to do so.

675
00:36:42,572 --> 00:36:46,058
So we haven't run into it, but it's absolutely a thing you have to preemptively avoid

676
00:36:46,338 --> 00:36:48,782
by choosing scaffolding that allows you to ship worldwide.

677
00:36:49,182 --> 00:36:49,863
Awesome. Thanks.

678
00:36:50,104 --> 00:36:50,745
Thank you very much.

679
00:36:51,946 --> 00:36:53,309
I think we'll use this as the final question,

680
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:56,033
as I've already taken seven more minutes of your day than I promised you.

681
00:36:56,979 --> 00:37:01,883
I'm not sure if you addressed this, but how do you actually get eyeballs to it outside

682
00:37:01,903 --> 00:37:02,284
of the game?

683
00:37:02,684 --> 00:37:07,909
Do you use paid advertising at all, or is it just messaging on your social platforms?

684
00:37:08,509 --> 00:37:09,410
And do you use all of them?

685
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:10,591
That's a really great question.

686
00:37:10,611 --> 00:37:13,533
So how do we draw eyeballs to our merchandise outside the game?

687
00:37:13,834 --> 00:37:14,654
Do we pay for ads?

688
00:37:14,694 --> 00:37:15,715
Do we put it on our social media?

689
00:37:15,735 --> 00:37:16,556
Do we send newsletters?

690
00:37:17,076 --> 00:37:17,177
So...

691
00:37:18,378 --> 00:37:23,920
For us, I think we made the very conscious decision going in that because Alta was a game that was meant to feel very unobtrusive

692
00:37:24,341 --> 00:37:29,383
and not like it was in your face or pestering or bugging you and rather acting as a relaxation aid,

693
00:37:29,823 --> 00:37:33,184
that merch was very much going to be a pleasant complimentary part of our universe,

694
00:37:33,245 --> 00:37:36,446
not a sort of big neon billboard part of our universe.

695
00:37:36,726 --> 00:37:39,467
So we actually, since the integration of the in-game store,

696
00:37:39,747 --> 00:37:42,769
have spent no marketing money drawing eyeballs to the store beyond...

697
00:37:43,629 --> 00:37:48,652
allowing players to access it when they play the game, and we see the existence of our web store as a pleasant

698
00:37:48,913 --> 00:37:54,516
complementary piece of the puzzle for players who choose to access it when they're visiting us on social media or

699
00:37:54,536 --> 00:37:57,598
you know, hearing about a new update or game in a newsletter.

700
00:37:57,638 --> 00:38:02,061
We always do keep it there as sort of a coda to that, but we haven't consciously chosen to do that.

701
00:38:02,341 --> 00:38:04,383
However, we're a seven-person team.

702
00:38:04,723 --> 00:38:08,165
So one of my huge caveats is that if you're a 20 person team or a 200 person team,

703
00:38:08,546 --> 00:38:11,408
the amount of importance you're going to put on merchandise

704
00:38:11,668 --> 00:38:15,290
becoming maybe a tertiary part of your main revenue is going to increase.

705
00:38:15,611 --> 00:38:18,453
And that way it would absolutely be worth creating sort of an in-house

706
00:38:18,733 --> 00:38:20,974
think tank around how to advertise and get that word out.

707
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:23,296
Thank you again everybody for taking the time to attend.

708
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:23,856
Cheers.
