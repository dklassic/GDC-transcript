1
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:08,014
So this talk is about defying expectations.

2
00:00:08,455 --> 00:00:10,156
Seven lessons from The Sims FreePlay.

3
00:00:12,597 --> 00:00:13,858
So first a little bit about me.

4
00:00:15,038 --> 00:00:17,620
So I'm Mavis, I'm the lead product manager at FireMonkeys.

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,841
I've been with EA for more than five years.

6
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:23,351
More than three of it was spent on The Sims FreePlay.

7
00:00:24,012 --> 00:00:26,736
Previously, I worked on shooters in Ubisoft Singapore,

8
00:00:26,796 --> 00:00:28,899
where I started as a monetization analyst.

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,784
My background is both in business and analytics,

10
00:00:33,785 --> 00:00:38,771
and spent more than eight years working on free-to-play titles on both PC and mobile.

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,381
So the agenda of what we're gonna cover today.

12
00:00:43,761 --> 00:00:45,302
So first, we're gonna cover some history.

13
00:00:45,322 --> 00:00:48,443
We're gonna start by anchoring ourselves

14
00:00:49,404 --> 00:00:50,485
on the product lifecycle,

15
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:52,506
and then we'll go through each stage

16
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:55,287
and the ensuing lessons that we've learned.

17
00:00:55,787 --> 00:00:57,588
And finally, we'll sum up with some takeaways.

18
00:01:03,393 --> 00:01:06,096
So first, some history, a bit vague,

19
00:01:06,196 --> 00:01:10,021
but some of you may or may not know Firemonkeys.

20
00:01:10,281 --> 00:01:12,744
It's an EA mobile studio in Melbourne, Australia.

21
00:01:12,764 --> 00:01:18,310
It was formed through the merger of acquisition

22
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,053
of two indie companies, Ironmonkey Studios and Firemint,

23
00:01:21,694 --> 00:01:24,177
and they creatively named themselves Firemonkeys.

24
00:01:25,614 --> 00:01:28,056
So the games that we're currently running

25
00:01:28,156 --> 00:01:31,418
include The Sims Replay, Real Racing 3, and Need for Speed.

26
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:33,980
No limits, previous titles include

27
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:35,822
Flight Control and Spy Mouse.

28
00:01:39,925 --> 00:01:42,827
So, let's go back to the beginning.

29
00:01:43,867 --> 00:01:46,669
What did The Sims Replay actually start out being?

30
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:52,249
So sometime in 2009, 2010, the initial plan was to port

31
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:58,113
existing premium mobile Sims title that the

32
00:01:58,153 --> 00:01:59,754
studio had to iPad.

33
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:05,038
I think in 2010, that was where the iPad was slated to

34
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:05,798
launch in April.

35
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:10,882
And the studio wanted to take advantage of being the first

36
00:02:10,902 --> 00:02:11,783
mover on a new platform.

37
00:02:12,807 --> 00:02:17,930
However, as the team near its end of its development cycle,

38
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,271
the EA mobile label decided that instead of premium,

39
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:22,552
it should go free to play.

40
00:02:24,893 --> 00:02:26,454
At that time, that kind of made sense

41
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:30,596
given the whole movement in social games on Facebook

42
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:32,337
being free and very successful.

43
00:02:33,497 --> 00:02:37,299
Next, it did not really make sense to be iPad only

44
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:39,900
given that free to play games work best with a large funnel.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,541
So therefore.

46
00:02:42,774 --> 00:02:45,616
the plan was made for the game to be on both mobile and tablet.

47
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:50,120
So the label didn't quite understand or know

48
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,522
what live services meant, because at that point,

49
00:02:52,562 --> 00:02:54,604
all we were shipping were premium titles, of which

50
00:02:55,024 --> 00:02:58,887
the expectation was really for us to keep the game around

51
00:02:58,927 --> 00:03:02,510
and kind of, you know, where the game would really only last

52
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:06,373
for like one to two years of expected lifetime and revenue.

53
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:08,755
But as I'm speaking here today,

54
00:03:09,804 --> 00:03:13,185
since WePlay has been alive for more than seven years in live service.

55
00:03:15,227 --> 00:03:21,871
So how do we do this and how do we defy the expectations of our longevity and the genre

56
00:03:22,051 --> 00:03:22,731
platform fit?

57
00:03:24,532 --> 00:03:29,035
So it starts by anchoring ourselves to the product lifecycle, which I find is an interesting

58
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:34,098
theory that fits quite well, particularly for the Sims WePlay and the way our revenue

59
00:03:34,138 --> 00:03:37,260
and performance is kind of mapped onto this theory.

60
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:41,748
So the seven lessons that we'll be covering today

61
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,989
map alongside this, and there are different challenges

62
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:46,911
in different stages of the product lifecycle.

63
00:03:49,052 --> 00:03:51,533
And what I like most about the product lifecycle

64
00:03:51,593 --> 00:03:53,454
is that it reminds us that live service

65
00:03:53,494 --> 00:03:55,115
is a marathon, not a sprint.

66
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:58,697
So let's start.

67
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:00,759
Well, the first stage is development,

68
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:03,800
which, from my personal experience,

69
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,182
is one of the most challenging parts of game making.

70
00:04:07,263 --> 00:04:10,105
primarily because you have no revenue and you have high uncertainty.

71
00:04:10,305 --> 00:04:12,166
And as a product manager, you also have no data.

72
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:17,569
So I would, you know, I guess an analogy that I frequently use is

73
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:22,713
it's like being stuck in a long, dark tunnel where you're walking

74
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:25,975
with a group of people and hoping that you've picked the right direction to walk in.

75
00:04:28,007 --> 00:04:31,529
So decisions in this stage have a large impact on the product.

76
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,551
So this is why the first lesson that we learned

77
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:37,393
at this first stage is the foundation setter.

78
00:04:37,594 --> 00:04:38,935
We were trying to answer the question,

79
00:04:39,575 --> 00:04:40,556
how can we start right?

80
00:04:42,185 --> 00:04:44,947
So development is risky business and in 2010,

81
00:04:45,947 --> 00:04:47,708
the good part about being on a new platform

82
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:52,191
is that you are at the cusp of crazy growth.

83
00:04:52,732 --> 00:04:54,973
However, the other thing that's pretty bad about it

84
00:04:55,053 --> 00:04:59,156
is that you really don't have that many references

85
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:00,116
of what good looks like.

86
00:05:00,156 --> 00:05:01,277
You kinda need to figure it out.

87
00:05:03,602 --> 00:05:05,284
In development, we ask lots of questions.

88
00:05:05,664 --> 00:05:06,985
Things like, where do we start?

89
00:05:07,325 --> 00:05:08,046
What do you build?

90
00:05:08,526 --> 00:05:09,627
What should the gameplay be?

91
00:05:09,868 --> 00:05:10,728
What should the meta be?

92
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:13,471
How are we going to attain, retain, and monetize?

93
00:05:14,311 --> 00:05:15,853
And how can we make good decisions

94
00:05:15,913 --> 00:05:17,954
while lacking any data?

95
00:05:19,676 --> 00:05:22,038
So I suppose with some good fortune,

96
00:05:22,418 --> 00:05:24,100
the Sims FreePlay team was able to leverage

97
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,762
some of its existing strengths and manage some risk.

98
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:31,364
So as mentioned previously, FireMonkeys has a long,

99
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:35,248
a pretty strong legacy of building mobile titles

100
00:05:35,308 --> 00:05:36,909
even before smartphones were around.

101
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:40,232
There was a similar team that had previously shipped

102
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:43,315
premium Sims titles, so they were familiar with each other

103
00:05:43,415 --> 00:05:45,117
and also familiar with the brand on mobile.

104
00:05:45,798 --> 00:05:48,000
So that was how we leveraged some of our strengths.

105
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:51,737
A key unknown was free-to-play.

106
00:05:53,078 --> 00:05:55,020
The studio had no experience doing free-to-play.

107
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,761
We were one of the first free-to-play titles

108
00:05:56,801 --> 00:05:58,202
that were launched by EA Mobile.

109
00:05:59,963 --> 00:06:03,605
And we didn't quite know how do you turn a sandbox simulation

110
00:06:03,645 --> 00:06:04,606
game to be free-to-play.

111
00:06:06,391 --> 00:06:07,712
So how do we mitigate unknowns?

112
00:06:07,772 --> 00:06:09,873
Well, you honestly make some guesses

113
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,894
and just try to use your best judgment

114
00:06:12,294 --> 00:06:14,875
of studying some successful competitors in the market,

115
00:06:15,015 --> 00:06:18,817
of which clearly there was some in social Facebook space.

116
00:06:20,558 --> 00:06:23,740
And I guess again, good fortune was that

117
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,261
the development was time box.

118
00:06:26,381 --> 00:06:28,541
Because historically, at least at that point,

119
00:06:28,561 --> 00:06:30,842
with premium mobile titles, we really

120
00:06:30,862 --> 00:06:32,162
needed to ship them quite quickly.

121
00:06:32,202 --> 00:06:33,843
And you really couldn't take your own sweet time.

122
00:06:34,223 --> 00:06:37,023
So that meant that while you were taking risks,

123
00:06:37,243 --> 00:06:39,164
you were forced to make decisions and just get it out.

124
00:06:44,665 --> 00:06:45,985
So these are some of the foundations

125
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:46,946
that we ended up picking.

126
00:06:47,686 --> 00:06:49,886
Just so if you're not aware of how the game works,

127
00:06:49,926 --> 00:06:53,067
this is kind of like the core loop and the broad meta.

128
00:06:55,065 --> 00:06:58,450
So players have sims who they just give them appointments.

129
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,434
For instance, in this case, we're asking sim to do a movie marathon.

130
00:07:02,376 --> 00:07:03,958
Set up the appointment. It takes time.

131
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,226
And then in exchange, once it's done, you collect simoleons and XP, XP that.

132
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:13,531
you know, this gives you progression in your player level. And simoleons you can spend in

133
00:07:13,731 --> 00:07:18,095
something like the build mode store where you have small amounts of spend and then you go into

134
00:07:18,115 --> 00:07:23,200
the town map which is a higher level where you can spend on building more houses and community

135
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:29,446
lots which lets you expand your sim town. So these were the foundations that we kind of set the game

136
00:07:29,526 --> 00:07:29,746
upon.

137
00:07:31,802 --> 00:07:34,844
And so to summarize, the foundation setter,

138
00:07:35,024 --> 00:07:36,605
well, first thing is you need to be honest,

139
00:07:36,945 --> 00:07:38,986
leverage what you do know, and mitigate what you don't.

140
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:41,748
Generally, try to resist the temptation

141
00:07:41,788 --> 00:07:43,669
to innovate on everything, because if you do,

142
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,752
there's too many ways that things can go wrong.

143
00:07:49,513 --> 00:07:52,115
And lastly, there's no recipe for success, right?

144
00:07:52,495 --> 00:07:55,537
Like there's no kind of fixed thing that you can do

145
00:07:55,557 --> 00:07:57,458
where you guarantee any sort of success,

146
00:07:57,498 --> 00:07:59,840
you just need to exercise your best judgment.

147
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,234
So for development, we're going to launch.

148
00:08:06,075 --> 00:08:08,517
In launch, quite usually, you know,

149
00:08:08,557 --> 00:08:10,819
hopefully you're lucky enough that you get high installs

150
00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:12,661
and then with high installs, your revenue spikes.

151
00:08:13,221 --> 00:08:14,542
Your return is normally not that great

152
00:08:14,663 --> 00:08:17,846
because perhaps your team is quite large at that point

153
00:08:18,266 --> 00:08:20,008
or maybe you haven't quite figured out

154
00:08:20,048 --> 00:08:23,531
how do you actually drive your key KPIs.

155
00:08:24,352 --> 00:08:24,992
So in stage two,

156
00:08:26,497 --> 00:08:28,377
It's the puzzle solver, where we really

157
00:08:28,397 --> 00:08:30,438
try to solve the puzzle of live service,

158
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:32,880
answering the question of, how can we set the game up

159
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,160
for long-term success?

160
00:08:37,522 --> 00:08:42,964
So to use Sims Replay as an example, at launch,

161
00:08:43,604 --> 00:08:46,026
this is what a DAU roughly mapped at.

162
00:08:47,366 --> 00:08:49,987
The Sims is an extremely strong brand and well-loved.

163
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,289
So it naturally came with really strong installs.

164
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,542
However, you can see our DAU started to slide,

165
00:08:57,463 --> 00:08:59,744
and it seems like our initial life service plan

166
00:08:59,764 --> 00:09:00,664
wasn't quite working out.

167
00:09:03,006 --> 00:09:03,786
So what was wrong?

168
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:06,548
So I think to answer that question,

169
00:09:06,568 --> 00:09:09,169
we firstly need to understand what life service actually is.

170
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,131
And the way I understand life service,

171
00:09:12,471 --> 00:09:16,213
it's like a puzzle which you have to kind of do

172
00:09:16,453 --> 00:09:17,774
under time pressure.

173
00:09:20,008 --> 00:09:21,630
There's a couple of elements that you're working with.

174
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,252
That includes dev time, your spending development time

175
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:28,634
to get some sort of output, of which the output then

176
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,376
drives some of your numbers, like your installs, retention,

177
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:31,856
and revenue.

178
00:09:33,297 --> 00:09:35,979
So how best you solve this puzzle

179
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,081
will determine your success.

180
00:09:39,782 --> 00:09:41,002
Problem is that development time can

181
00:09:41,022 --> 00:09:42,584
be spent on multiple different things,

182
00:09:42,744 --> 00:09:45,766
like maintenance, events, content, new features,

183
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:46,866
a whole heap of other things.

184
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:49,950
And it's how you find that balance

185
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,491
of managing the input and output

186
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:54,114
that effectively lets you get the best results

187
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,916
in order to try to achieve some growth.

188
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,023
So different games will definitely face

189
00:10:02,063 --> 00:10:03,104
different problems at launch.

190
00:10:03,684 --> 00:10:05,166
And in some free play, the first thing you had to do

191
00:10:05,226 --> 00:10:07,288
is really try to identify what was wrong.

192
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:14,711
So through updates, our live service plan was basically to put content directly into the Buildmode store.

193
00:10:15,271 --> 00:10:23,835
Remember, again, this is more than seven years ago, and there really wasn't a lot of competitor games that could give us some guidance.

194
00:10:25,085 --> 00:10:27,046
So put the content in the store, and then we saw the

195
00:10:27,066 --> 00:10:28,848
numbers, or our DAU saw the slide.

196
00:10:29,848 --> 00:10:33,231
And the reality is that just putting things directly into

197
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:36,053
the store really doesn't quite sustain DAU, because players

198
00:10:36,073 --> 00:10:37,835
can just consume the content immediately.

199
00:10:38,175 --> 00:10:39,576
If I want that so far, I would just buy it.

200
00:10:39,856 --> 00:10:43,399
I don't really need to wait four weeks to buy it.

201
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,443
And the problem was that the way we were delivering content

202
00:10:48,483 --> 00:10:50,224
was not giving us the return that we needed.

203
00:10:50,444 --> 00:10:52,826
So we needed to really find a way to

204
00:10:52,866 --> 00:10:54,147
retain players for longer.

205
00:10:56,168 --> 00:10:57,449
So how do we solve this problem?

206
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,711
We knew that, yes, the problem was the way

207
00:11:00,031 --> 00:11:01,051
we were delivering content,

208
00:11:01,472 --> 00:11:03,553
so we figured a different way of delivering it.

209
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:06,415
So one thing that the team experimented with

210
00:11:06,495 --> 00:11:07,835
was the notion of quests.

211
00:11:08,436 --> 00:11:10,757
We started putting content behind quests,

212
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,339
where players had to engage in a quest

213
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:15,020
in order to win content at the end.

214
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,262
And how it works is really quite simple.

215
00:11:19,282 --> 00:11:19,963
The update drops.

216
00:11:21,393 --> 00:11:24,294
Players have to go through a quest for 5 to 14 days,

217
00:11:24,454 --> 00:11:26,095
actually engaging and sticking around.

218
00:11:26,655 --> 00:11:28,356
And then if they're successful, they

219
00:11:28,376 --> 00:11:29,956
get to win the content as we want.

220
00:11:31,097 --> 00:11:34,598
So this is some UI showing both the timer, the prize,

221
00:11:34,678 --> 00:11:36,879
as well as progression, as well as story

222
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:39,199
that we have to write for the quest.

223
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,981
So it worked well in extending the content lifespan

224
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,261
and helped to solve the puzzle.

225
00:11:46,642 --> 00:11:50,205
And so as a result, we started seeing numbers start moving

226
00:11:50,345 --> 00:11:54,388
slowly upwards as we started introducing Quests more and

227
00:11:54,408 --> 00:11:55,189
more in our updates.

228
00:11:57,811 --> 00:11:59,713
And DAU gradually started to grow.

229
00:12:00,934 --> 00:12:06,639
So to summarize, lesson two is a puzzle solver, where the

230
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,681
first thing you have to do is identify the key problems at

231
00:12:09,741 --> 00:12:13,845
launch, and then solve, use live services, and solve that

232
00:12:13,885 --> 00:12:14,906
puzzle of live services.

233
00:12:16,857 --> 00:12:19,119
And solving the puzzle is actually really key to actually

234
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:20,179
having a viable product.

235
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:21,900
If not, all your numbers start dropping,

236
00:12:22,081 --> 00:12:24,762
and it really doesn't make sense to continue, really

237
00:12:24,802 --> 00:12:27,284
continue running live service.

238
00:12:33,888 --> 00:12:38,391
So after launch, we go into this is probably the best stage,

239
00:12:38,411 --> 00:12:40,352
because it's where you feel kind of invincible.

240
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:42,053
But it really is the growth stage.

241
00:12:43,175 --> 00:12:47,497
where revenue starts to increase, you can start reducing your costs and your return

242
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:53,339
actually increases. It's worth noting that, of course, if you take too long to actually

243
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:57,461
invest in growth, and if you don't realize that you're actually, you've solved the puzzle

244
00:12:57,481 --> 00:13:01,142
and you're not, and you're kind of moving to the growth stage, you will be missing out

245
00:13:01,182 --> 00:13:06,524
on a chance to really quickly, you know, kickstart, you know, some of the growth of some of your

246
00:13:06,544 --> 00:13:10,626
numbers. So lesson three is the growth investor.

247
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,470
Where we try to answer the question here,

248
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,951
which is how can we scale?

249
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:18,091
If you've solved the puzzle, you know what works,

250
00:13:18,391 --> 00:13:19,152
how do you scale?

251
00:13:20,952 --> 00:13:23,033
So the Sims FreePlay is a simulation sandbox game.

252
00:13:24,033 --> 00:13:26,594
And as explained previously with the quests,

253
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:33,336
we work best, we basically know how to drive our numbers

254
00:13:33,436 --> 00:13:36,076
provided that we know how to use content.

255
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:40,417
And given that we've solved the puzzle of delivering content,

256
00:13:40,877 --> 00:13:43,118
now what we need to do is just increase.

257
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:45,318
One thing we need to do to scale is to increase content

258
00:13:45,338 --> 00:13:45,819
production.

259
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:49,400
First thing we did was grow the internal art team.

260
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,580
Now we know where if we build more assets,

261
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:53,721
you can drive more KPIs.

262
00:13:55,122 --> 00:13:57,042
The benefit about growing the internal art team as well is

263
00:13:57,082 --> 00:14:00,243
that it allows us to work more on outsourcing as well, which

264
00:14:00,363 --> 00:14:02,344
multiplies the amount of content that you

265
00:14:02,364 --> 00:14:03,204
can put into your game.

266
00:14:04,547 --> 00:14:07,209
As a result, over the past seven years with every update,

267
00:14:07,249 --> 00:14:11,031
we've been steadily adding assets with every update.

268
00:14:11,211 --> 00:14:14,072
Some numbers include like we have more than 6,000

269
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,954
built-in objects and more than 11,000 customization

270
00:14:16,974 --> 00:14:18,155
and coding options.

271
00:14:22,644 --> 00:14:25,766
For a simulation sandbox game, this actually

272
00:14:25,806 --> 00:14:29,289
has the added benefit of making it really hard for new titles

273
00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:29,909
to compete.

274
00:14:30,189 --> 00:14:32,131
And if you have any sense of how the market is,

275
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:35,533
a lot of the titles that still continue

276
00:14:35,553 --> 00:14:37,215
to be in the top grossing actually

277
00:14:37,235 --> 00:14:39,036
tend to be quite old, because they actually

278
00:14:39,356 --> 00:14:40,577
get stronger over time.

279
00:14:41,878 --> 00:14:45,301
By virtue of the fact that if it's a simulation sandbox,

280
00:14:45,461 --> 00:14:46,682
the more options they give players,

281
00:14:46,702 --> 00:14:48,904
the more likely they are going to just stick with the game,

282
00:14:48,924 --> 00:14:50,525
because it allows them to tell more stories

283
00:14:50,605 --> 00:14:51,686
and just do a lot more.

284
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:58,157
So the next thing that we did to try to scale and grow,

285
00:14:58,778 --> 00:15:01,101
invest in growth, was to reduce costs.

286
00:15:02,763 --> 00:15:04,706
So we reduced costs through tools.

287
00:15:06,023 --> 00:15:08,325
Tools help to reduce engineering time, which is

288
00:15:08,385 --> 00:15:11,847
highly valuable, and really shouldn't be spent on

289
00:15:11,887 --> 00:15:13,449
repetitive things like live events.

290
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,671
Engineering time could be better spent building

291
00:15:16,711 --> 00:15:17,111
features.

292
00:15:17,972 --> 00:15:20,514
And the other thing that tools gave us was the opportunity to

293
00:15:20,574 --> 00:15:21,835
empower other disciplines.

294
00:15:22,556 --> 00:15:24,817
Like for instance, we have the data tool for tuning where

295
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:30,382
designers can just put in tuning without

296
00:15:30,422 --> 00:15:31,202
needing an engineer.

297
00:15:32,225 --> 00:15:35,487
Same way with quests, when we knew that quests were working,

298
00:15:35,527 --> 00:15:37,389
we started to create templates for quests

299
00:15:37,589 --> 00:15:41,331
so that it was just, in general, there was less room for error.

300
00:15:41,511 --> 00:15:45,493
And then design could put things in with minimal code effort.

301
00:15:46,554 --> 00:15:49,796
We built sales tools so that PMs could create sales and rerun

302
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:51,637
sales easily without needing any code.

303
00:15:51,837 --> 00:15:54,039
And we also built a scheduler tool

304
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:56,380
so that if we, in the event that we

305
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,982
needed to move our events around or just push in new events,

306
00:16:00,022 --> 00:16:00,523
we could do it.

307
00:16:01,163 --> 00:16:02,184
extremely quickly.

308
00:16:05,266 --> 00:16:09,488
Another thing worth noting is that definitely there are economies of scale where the more we

309
00:16:09,508 --> 00:16:16,053
do something the better that we will get at it. So the third thing that we did to invest in growth

310
00:16:16,273 --> 00:16:20,816
was to actually look at the features themselves. So we knew that quests work, however of course

311
00:16:21,236 --> 00:16:26,700
once the quest ended you would see your numbers drop again. So what we figured was we should just

312
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,421
chain all the quests together.

313
00:16:30,091 --> 00:16:39,234
Where here you can see examples of the different quests that unlock at different levels, like cooking on the spin plant, or horses for instance.

314
00:16:40,872 --> 00:16:43,435
And for simulation sandbox game, this is quite interesting

315
00:16:43,515 --> 00:16:47,580
because it gave players a path to progress,

316
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,801
where they could unlock features,

317
00:16:50,463 --> 00:16:53,646
where if not everyone is extremely creative

318
00:16:53,827 --> 00:16:55,889
and not everyone knows how to set goals

319
00:16:55,929 --> 00:16:58,993
in a sandbox space, but now with this sort of progression

320
00:16:59,013 --> 00:17:00,935
that we're able to offer players where

321
00:17:01,635 --> 00:17:05,158
as they level up they get an opportunity to play through quests that unlock new features which

322
00:17:05,178 --> 00:17:11,082
makes them feel like they are really kind of growing and expanding the possibility of what

323
00:17:11,122 --> 00:17:16,166
they can do in the game. So this helped to strengthen our baselines in general and to

324
00:17:16,206 --> 00:17:23,631
give players something to do in between updates and in between events. So the fourth thing that we did to

325
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:31,566
investing growth was this really cool thing where we started looking at user-generated content.

326
00:17:34,816 --> 00:17:38,459
So houses are actually very expensive for us to build.

327
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:41,842
It takes an artist probably several days

328
00:17:42,903 --> 00:17:43,864
just to put a house together.

329
00:17:43,884 --> 00:17:46,586
And this is just using our assets that exist.

330
00:17:46,606 --> 00:17:50,509
However, it's highly demanded and valued by players.

331
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:53,772
As you saw briefly previously, there was a town map.

332
00:17:53,832 --> 00:17:55,514
And players actually set goals on,

333
00:17:55,654 --> 00:17:58,156
I want to put all these amazing mansions on my town map.

334
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,338
But real problem was that we just could not

335
00:18:00,398 --> 00:18:01,138
afford to build them.

336
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,001
So we built this feature, which is

337
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,462
one of our most successful features,

338
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,483
called the Architect Homes, which allows players

339
00:18:09,503 --> 00:18:10,743
to submit their houses.

340
00:18:11,504 --> 00:18:14,785
And we actually pick them manually every two weeks.

341
00:18:15,325 --> 00:18:18,506
And we data push them out to players,

342
00:18:19,027 --> 00:18:20,707
allowing them to both preview and purchase.

343
00:18:20,727 --> 00:18:24,949
I would say that this feature has been around for years.

344
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:28,290
And more than 80% of our houses are actually

345
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,671
user-generated houses.

346
00:18:31,382 --> 00:18:33,263
Effectively, this removes us completely.

347
00:18:33,283 --> 00:18:35,565
With the exception of picking, it removes us completely

348
00:18:35,605 --> 00:18:36,745
as a bottleneck for content.

349
00:18:37,506 --> 00:18:40,367
And it allows players to showcase what they've built.

350
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:44,209
And to a large extent, the things that they build

351
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:45,790
are way better than anything that we could build.

352
00:18:49,012 --> 00:18:52,314
So to summarize, lesson three, in the growth stage.

353
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,731
What you really want to do is invest in growth.

354
00:18:56,611 --> 00:18:57,712
Invest in the thing that works,

355
00:18:58,092 --> 00:18:59,712
and clearly as explained,

356
00:18:59,732 --> 00:19:01,713
there are multiple ways of investing in growth.

357
00:19:03,153 --> 00:19:04,794
You can gain efficiencies in content creation

358
00:19:04,854 --> 00:19:06,555
and consumption, that's basically the goal.

359
00:19:07,535 --> 00:19:10,136
And if you don't know much about simulation games,

360
00:19:10,196 --> 00:19:12,217
really, they actually do get stronger over time.

361
00:19:14,897 --> 00:19:16,898
And the opportunity cost if you can't scale,

362
00:19:16,918 --> 00:19:18,239
there's definitely opportunity cost

363
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:21,220
if you're not trying to scale when the time is right.

364
00:19:27,024 --> 00:19:28,986
So the paradox of content.

365
00:19:29,486 --> 00:19:31,828
Well, it's easy to say, let's build a pipeline.

366
00:19:32,028 --> 00:19:33,350
Let's just, we know content works,

367
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,731
let's just build lots of content, right?

368
00:19:35,711 --> 00:19:37,053
So we know that we need to build content.

369
00:19:37,713 --> 00:19:38,774
We know how to build it.

370
00:19:40,435 --> 00:19:41,937
The real problem is what should we build?

371
00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:47,461
So this Afro guy says that if you build it, they will come.

372
00:19:49,334 --> 00:19:51,075
But reality is no, that's not true.

373
00:19:51,835 --> 00:19:54,437
And we learned that the hard way by building things

374
00:19:54,497 --> 00:19:56,237
that players just didn't want.

375
00:19:57,698 --> 00:20:01,220
And the difference between a good content that people want

376
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,341
and a dark content can be more than 50%.

377
00:20:04,902 --> 00:20:06,422
An example that comes to mind is

378
00:20:07,443 --> 00:20:13,365
Christmas events tend to be our biggest and most expensive events because it's great seasonality.

379
00:20:13,945 --> 00:20:18,747
So there was one Christmas where we decided to go fantasy. We were like, oh fantasy, you know, it would be quite cool.

380
00:20:19,547 --> 00:20:23,849
The update dropped, the event started, and then on Facebook people started asking

381
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:25,769
where's the Christmas event?

382
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:33,572
So there's a really painful lesson because players, you know, if they're not really into it, they're just not going to actually play it.

383
00:20:35,073 --> 00:20:36,773
So lesson four is the keen listener.

384
00:20:38,832 --> 00:20:40,915
And really we're trying to answer the question here

385
00:20:41,275 --> 00:20:43,098
of what should we build?

386
00:20:47,244 --> 00:20:50,810
And surprise, well, at least for the Sims,

387
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,013
we have great audience, so the players will tell you.

388
00:20:54,444 --> 00:20:56,547
Since we play an audience, SKU is younger.

389
00:20:57,227 --> 00:20:59,590
They're highly vocal with lots of opinions.

390
00:21:00,491 --> 00:21:02,413
And the challenge, or the thing that we have to do,

391
00:21:02,533 --> 00:21:04,856
is actually just manage those channels.

392
00:21:05,577 --> 00:21:08,079
So we use channels like Facebook, Twitter,

393
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,282
EA runs this thing called Game Changers

394
00:21:10,362 --> 00:21:11,603
with our community managers.

395
00:21:12,324 --> 00:21:16,726
We have forums, websites, and customer support, as well as internal channels where we actually

396
00:21:16,886 --> 00:21:22,388
ask questions like customer satisfaction surveys, user experience research. These are all the

397
00:21:22,408 --> 00:21:27,010
different things that we do in order to get a sense of what should we build, what do players

398
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:27,570
actually want.

399
00:21:28,984 --> 00:21:30,625
Some of the things that we can learn include

400
00:21:31,285 --> 00:21:32,305
what content do they want?

401
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:35,066
When it comes to surveys, we actually brainstorm

402
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:39,187
a list of things like, do they want Venetian mansions?

403
00:21:39,588 --> 00:21:42,729
Or do they want submarines?

404
00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:43,949
Or do they wanna be in space?

405
00:21:43,989 --> 00:21:45,930
We actually force them to stack rank it.

406
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:49,591
And that is how we use to prioritize our content roadmap.

407
00:21:51,712 --> 00:21:53,912
We ask them things like, what would you like to see again?

408
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:55,633
And that's something that we also use

409
00:21:55,693 --> 00:21:58,594
to plan our calendar of reruns.

410
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,611
This is something that we can tell actually

411
00:22:01,671 --> 00:22:03,712
through telemetry, but because we have different sources

412
00:22:03,732 --> 00:22:06,154
of information, triangulating that is normally

413
00:22:06,174 --> 00:22:06,754
quite a good thing.

414
00:22:09,456 --> 00:22:11,477
Sometimes you also come up with hypotheses

415
00:22:11,557 --> 00:22:13,379
of what some features might be,

416
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,760
like for instance, professions or pregnancy.

417
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:18,902
These were all things that we had hypothesized

418
00:22:18,942 --> 00:22:22,324
and then we put into a survey and then figured

419
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,226
which ones would actually work the best,

420
00:22:24,286 --> 00:22:26,507
so which ones were actually most highly desired.

421
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:31,012
And also understanding how the players feel about the features that we release.

422
00:22:31,072 --> 00:22:33,973
For instance, you know, how many people are actually using the relationship system?

423
00:22:34,013 --> 00:22:35,194
How important is it for them?

424
00:22:35,734 --> 00:22:38,215
And trying to get a sense of should we actually iterate?

425
00:22:38,235 --> 00:22:40,476
Should we spend any time optimizing this system?

426
00:22:42,309 --> 00:22:47,171
Lastly, it's hard, but sometimes it is possible to try to understand some of their motivations,

427
00:22:47,211 --> 00:22:49,693
the kind of why, why do they actually want this thing.

428
00:22:50,793 --> 00:22:55,535
It's challenging given that we are a simulation sandbox and different people have different

429
00:22:55,595 --> 00:22:58,337
goals and different reasons for wanting certain things.

430
00:22:59,937 --> 00:23:05,600
But most recently we had done a customer satisfaction survey that kind of clarified something that

431
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,202
gave us insight to something that we never thought of, actually.

432
00:23:10,042 --> 00:23:10,222
So...

433
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:15,066
Hair is something that does very well in our game.

434
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:17,748
It's been doing very well for years.

435
00:23:17,768 --> 00:23:20,009
It's something that players have always been,

436
00:23:20,089 --> 00:23:21,210
just an example of hair,

437
00:23:22,051 --> 00:23:25,933
players have been asking on all channels for years,

438
00:23:26,053 --> 00:23:27,334
and we've always, you know,

439
00:23:27,354 --> 00:23:29,435
we've started running like a hair hobby event,

440
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:32,197
and we've since added more hair hobby events

441
00:23:32,337 --> 00:23:33,718
and more hair live events.

442
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,343
Our understanding of why players wanted hair was basically,

443
00:23:39,783 --> 00:23:42,525
we just thought that they look just like customization

444
00:23:42,845 --> 00:23:44,106
and hair is just cool.

445
00:23:44,246 --> 00:23:48,870
And another thought that we had was that hair is actually,

446
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,053
some, you know, hair means more

447
00:23:53,113 --> 00:23:56,195
because our hair that we had launched initially

448
00:23:56,215 --> 00:23:58,197
with the game didn't look very good.

449
00:23:58,257 --> 00:24:00,258
So as such, players actually wanted more hair.

450
00:24:02,398 --> 00:24:06,419
So in the customer satisfaction survey that we had run recently, we asked,

451
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:11,560
why did you really enjoy this recent boutique hair life event?

452
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,201
And it gave us some insight that we never,

453
00:24:15,681 --> 00:24:18,421
it kind of gave us insight that we had never thought of,

454
00:24:18,501 --> 00:24:21,422
at least in the development team who have been building hair for years.

455
00:24:21,462 --> 00:24:23,282
You know, we didn't actually realize this.

456
00:24:24,202 --> 00:24:25,623
So the insight was...

457
00:24:27,144 --> 00:24:33,148
Look at this. This is our sim tracker. The sim tracker is something that we use for, that players use to

458
00:24:33,629 --> 00:24:37,832
select between their sims because players have lots of sims. Some players have 30 plus sims.

459
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:41,155
And if we look a bit closer,

460
00:24:41,175 --> 00:24:45,098
you can notice something.

461
00:24:53,564 --> 00:24:53,865
So,

462
00:24:54,865 --> 00:24:56,226
players actually want hair.

463
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:59,326
because sims have the same face.

464
00:25:01,509 --> 00:25:04,049
And hair is actually, you know,

465
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,430
cheaper for us to create than face.

466
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:10,411
But this was insight that we actually didn't realize

467
00:25:10,491 --> 00:25:12,932
because of us, the sim track is actually really small

468
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:15,853
and, you know, the tiny little thumbnail of sims

469
00:25:15,953 --> 00:25:18,434
meant that players of, or same face sims

470
00:25:18,594 --> 00:25:20,575
meant that players actually couldn't tell them apart.

471
00:25:21,055 --> 00:25:22,715
So with more hair options,

472
00:25:22,815 --> 00:25:25,856
they now had more ways of solving that problem

473
00:25:25,956 --> 00:25:27,737
in ways that we didn't ever think of.

474
00:25:28,797 --> 00:25:32,360
So that's one of the things that you get to learn and I think it's pretty cool to learn that

475
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:40,646
years after we've been beating the drum of hair is great because players just like hair. Turns out there's actual utility in hair for our players.

476
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:46,029
So to summarize, lesson four, the keen listener.

477
00:25:48,211 --> 00:25:54,215
So we earn our target audience, that's pretty clear since we play as SKUs young and SKUs female.

478
00:25:56,149 --> 00:25:59,152
We have to build multiple channels to both listen and ask questions

479
00:26:00,053 --> 00:26:03,497
because of how much it costs to develop content.

480
00:26:04,358 --> 00:26:07,321
This helps to guide development and guide the way we do things

481
00:26:07,361 --> 00:26:09,484
so it reduces risk of things not working out.

482
00:26:10,305 --> 00:26:13,128
And this is something that's really relevant all throughout the product lifecycle,

483
00:26:13,188 --> 00:26:15,731
although perhaps more relevant when you actually have a product out there.

484
00:26:20,087 --> 00:26:22,628
So we move on to stage four, after growth,

485
00:26:22,808 --> 00:26:24,129
which is the real fun part,

486
00:26:24,469 --> 00:26:25,870
you go into something called maturity.

487
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:30,272
Here, your revenue kind of flattens,

488
00:26:30,372 --> 00:26:32,393
you can still continue to reduce costs,

489
00:26:32,653 --> 00:26:36,635
and your return is perhaps increasing but not as fast.

490
00:26:38,696 --> 00:26:42,297
Hopefully you hit maturity years into your life cycle,

491
00:26:42,337 --> 00:26:44,618
and not immediately, because that would be quite strange.

492
00:26:48,043 --> 00:26:53,585
Operating this long at a fixed pace of maybe six to eight weeks, you ship an update.

493
00:26:54,186 --> 00:26:56,226
It is fast, it's fast-paced.

494
00:26:56,707 --> 00:27:05,010
There's always going to be mistakes in live service, and so general issues that kind of snowball as you keep kicking the can down the road for many years.

495
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:08,292
So lesson five is the fixer, which is

496
00:27:09,612 --> 00:27:10,553
how do we recover?

497
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:21,021
So for mistakes in live service, there are several categories.

498
00:27:21,781 --> 00:27:23,862
The obvious ones are bugs, of which

499
00:27:23,902 --> 00:27:26,022
if you worked in a simulation game,

500
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:27,623
they're always very hilarious bugs,

501
00:27:28,463 --> 00:27:30,223
things clipping each other and whatnot.

502
00:27:32,564 --> 00:27:34,345
As mentioned previously, there's

503
00:27:36,049 --> 00:27:37,609
Mistakes of not getting the content right,

504
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,870
of which that's really hard to fix, right?

505
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:44,111
Like if you invested lots of days building something

506
00:27:44,191 --> 00:27:46,772
and you kind of need to launch it effectively,

507
00:27:46,812 --> 00:27:48,993
and then you just probably won't launch it again.

508
00:27:52,133 --> 00:27:53,994
Next one is not getting the feature right, which

509
00:27:54,034 --> 00:27:57,055
is quite common, given that we, at least in 3Play,

510
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:59,175
we don't really soft launch our features.

511
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:00,756
We don't really have a way of testing

512
00:28:00,796 --> 00:28:02,616
whether it works or not, other than playing it

513
00:28:02,776 --> 00:28:03,937
before we launch it.

514
00:28:05,881 --> 00:28:08,262
These sorts of mistakes impact following, including stability,

515
00:28:08,882 --> 00:28:13,264
sentiment on social channels, and feature

516
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:14,185
and event performance.

517
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:19,467
So in general, you kind of need to decide how you deal with it.

518
00:28:19,487 --> 00:28:21,448
And like any good life service, you

519
00:28:21,468 --> 00:28:23,609
will need to have a triage process, which

520
00:28:23,649 --> 00:28:26,070
you kind of evaluate the severity, the impact,

521
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,131
and kind of decide how urgent it is to fix.

522
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,222
using the different channels that we mentioned previously,

523
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:32,603
you have to communicate transparently

524
00:28:32,623 --> 00:28:35,787
and as well as obviously, I guess, timely.

525
00:28:37,609 --> 00:28:38,510
And with the other mistakes,

526
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,512
you have to kind of try to find a way to deal with them

527
00:28:41,232 --> 00:28:45,077
based on the impact of what it's currently causing

528
00:28:45,577 --> 00:28:47,679
as well as the return of what it can get you,

529
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,781
perhaps, if you solve it.

530
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:52,151
You have to consider both the risks to player sentiment

531
00:28:52,191 --> 00:28:53,994
and KPIs, given that we are a live game.

532
00:28:54,254 --> 00:28:57,198
If you start changing things, players will notice

533
00:28:57,238 --> 00:28:58,199
and they will talk about it.

534
00:28:58,219 --> 00:29:00,282
So are you prepared for that?

535
00:29:01,925 --> 00:29:03,567
In general, rule of thumb is that if you are going

536
00:29:03,587 --> 00:29:05,389
to change something, it's easier to add something

537
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:06,391
than it is to remove it.

538
00:29:12,007 --> 00:29:14,489
So another, this is not really a mistake,

539
00:29:14,529 --> 00:29:16,070
but it's just something that applies

540
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:18,332
if you're running a long-term life service.

541
00:29:18,772 --> 00:29:20,514
It's the weakening foundations.

542
00:29:21,534 --> 00:29:22,615
These are some challenging things

543
00:29:22,655 --> 00:29:24,657
to overcome in a state of maturity.

544
00:29:26,445 --> 00:29:29,467
So one of the things that would happen is diminishing returns.

545
00:29:29,628 --> 00:29:31,589
If you keep doing the same thing over and over,

546
00:29:31,609 --> 00:29:33,070
an example would be SimCount.

547
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:36,152
We give players SimCount if they level up

548
00:29:36,332 --> 00:29:38,574
so that they get to add more Sims to their SimTown,

549
00:29:38,614 --> 00:29:39,174
which is great.

550
00:29:40,915 --> 00:29:41,756
But like anything that.

551
00:29:42,336 --> 00:29:48,738
any reward, the first few times, maybe the first 10 sims is great, but by the 30th, 35th one,

552
00:29:48,898 --> 00:29:55,679
is it as valuable or do you still feel as much joy from getting it? Then they add a problem of

553
00:29:55,739 --> 00:30:02,541
course, scalability, like as previously seen, the sim tracker is going to keep, you know,

554
00:30:02,561 --> 00:30:05,282
you need a place where you have to keep scrolling through it.

555
00:30:08,238 --> 00:30:09,319
The next thing is expectation.

556
00:30:09,339 --> 00:30:11,261
So this is interesting because good design

557
00:30:11,301 --> 00:30:12,963
means that players know how to set expectations.

558
00:30:13,744 --> 00:30:15,725
However, it also would hamstring us

559
00:30:16,026 --> 00:30:18,048
because something like quests, for instance,

560
00:30:18,128 --> 00:30:19,489
is a fixed way of doing things.

561
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:21,531
Players expect it to work in that same way.

562
00:30:21,651 --> 00:30:24,153
And even if we find ways, problems with it,

563
00:30:24,173 --> 00:30:25,214
or ways to optimize it.

564
00:30:26,284 --> 00:30:27,766
Players understand the rules, and they're not

565
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,848
going to be super happy you start changing things

566
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:30,329
around them.

567
00:30:30,349 --> 00:30:33,913
At the same time, they've also ritualized and figured out

568
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:35,475
a solution of min-maxing it.

569
00:30:35,495 --> 00:30:37,878
So that's something that you need to take into account,

570
00:30:37,918 --> 00:30:41,702
knowing that the longer you run your live service,

571
00:30:41,802 --> 00:30:43,484
the more likely that players will have

572
00:30:43,544 --> 00:30:44,786
built up those expectations.

573
00:30:47,503 --> 00:30:48,384
The next is anchoring.

574
00:30:48,404 --> 00:30:53,889
On the PM side, you know, obviously if you anchor too low of a price,

575
00:30:54,309 --> 00:30:58,013
like what I mentioned previously, it's going to be quite hard for you to increase it, at least immediately.

576
00:30:59,632 --> 00:31:03,416
And when it comes to rewards, we tended to go really big

577
00:31:03,676 --> 00:31:06,599
with our whenever we launched a new event, where we went,

578
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:10,322
like, here are heaps of rewards, and here are super high quality

579
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:12,884
ones at the same time, only to realize that we can't actually

580
00:31:13,005 --> 00:31:14,005
keep up that pace.

581
00:31:15,387 --> 00:31:19,611
So that's quite hard, because in live service, players are like,

582
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,472
but the other event was much stronger.

583
00:31:21,492 --> 00:31:22,814
I expected more.

584
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:25,856
But yet, you kind of can't keep up that pace.

585
00:31:28,074 --> 00:31:29,455
So we have to be careful and thoughtful in how

586
00:31:29,495 --> 00:31:31,796
we solve these problems because it is,

587
00:31:33,017 --> 00:31:35,258
players have been used to something and you can't just,

588
00:31:35,318 --> 00:31:37,819
you know, it's not great to pull the rug from under them.

589
00:31:41,001 --> 00:31:43,282
So lesson five is immaturity.

590
00:31:43,302 --> 00:31:44,823
It's the fixer.

591
00:31:45,043 --> 00:31:47,184
It's normal and expected to trip up.

592
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:49,465
Sometimes they're game-breaking things,

593
00:31:49,505 --> 00:31:50,566
so that's where you trip immediately,

594
00:31:50,586 --> 00:31:52,127
or there's weakening foundations

595
00:31:52,187 --> 00:31:55,088
where you do a slow motion fall, basically.

596
00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:00,513
You have to be prepared to fix bugs with an effective triage

597
00:32:00,553 --> 00:32:01,013
process.

598
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:06,477
And regularly try to assess the fundamental problems

599
00:32:06,537 --> 00:32:09,759
in your games, because it keeps changing as the foundations

600
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:10,980
weaken and things change.

601
00:32:11,661 --> 00:32:12,701
And consider solutions.

602
00:32:14,403 --> 00:32:17,205
This we found quite hard to do when

603
00:32:17,225 --> 00:32:19,726
you have been working on a title for so long.

604
00:32:19,786 --> 00:32:22,148
It's hard to take a step back and then evaluate what's

605
00:32:23,529 --> 00:32:26,190
Are we doing something wrong or actually what's happening?

606
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:30,473
And we found that a good solution to this is actually to bring new people in.

607
00:32:30,493 --> 00:32:35,375
With a set of fresh eyes, we were able to find things like, you know, we were pricing certain

608
00:32:35,416 --> 00:32:40,178
things the exact same way because our engineering team was just duplicating the price and we forgot

609
00:32:40,198 --> 00:32:44,701
to actually price things. So these were all things that we uncovered when we brought new people in.

610
00:32:48,978 --> 00:32:51,199
And finally, be both careful and thoughtful

611
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,801
with weakening foundations.

612
00:32:55,002 --> 00:32:58,064
So you can learn things clearly by making mistakes,

613
00:32:58,444 --> 00:33:01,306
but live service is primarily about launching and learning.

614
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:04,829
So in six-week cycles, you learn by building,

615
00:33:04,869 --> 00:33:05,749
measuring, and learning.

616
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:09,452
I look at every update as an opportunity

617
00:33:09,512 --> 00:33:11,333
to try new things and learn something.

618
00:33:11,353 --> 00:33:13,214
So I think that's a good approach to have.

619
00:33:14,474 --> 00:33:17,536
Two ways of testing hypotheses include launching and then measuring after,

620
00:33:17,556 --> 00:33:21,938
or of course, during A-B testing, or multivariate testing,

621
00:33:22,118 --> 00:33:24,819
where you are trying out different variables and seeing what works.

622
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:30,842
For both, a very important principle applies, which is

623
00:33:31,463 --> 00:33:34,704
we have to set up your expectations and hypotheses in both instances

624
00:33:35,265 --> 00:33:36,525
before you actually do the thing.

625
00:33:36,885 --> 00:33:40,347
So this is one of the key ways in which you sharpen your judgment.

626
00:33:41,747 --> 00:33:45,950
My personal view is that it really doesn't matter if you're completely inaccurate of

627
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:50,713
saying like, for instance, if we do this thing, the uplift might be 10 to 20% and then in

628
00:33:50,973 --> 00:33:51,834
reality it might be 40%.

629
00:33:51,954 --> 00:33:57,057
It doesn't matter because you took a stab at it and then, you know, it prevents you

630
00:33:57,077 --> 00:34:00,779
from falling into the trap of confirmation bias knowing like, yeah, I knew it would increase

631
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:05,342
but you know, you said 10 to 20% so now you can adjust the way you're thinking to get

632
00:34:05,402 --> 00:34:09,605
closer to understanding how features perform in the future.

633
00:34:11,295 --> 00:34:14,357
So lesson six is the validated learner,

634
00:34:14,537 --> 00:34:17,199
which is how do we really make sure that we are learning

635
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,180
and not just trying a bunch of things?

636
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:28,246
So with A-B testing,

637
00:34:29,847 --> 00:34:31,608
general principle is to try to test changes

638
00:34:31,628 --> 00:34:33,109
where you're not certain on the impact.

639
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,231
If you really know that it's gonna do something,

640
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:38,773
unless you're trying to optimize it further,

641
00:34:38,793 --> 00:34:39,974
there's really no need to test it.

642
00:34:41,863 --> 00:34:46,567
A couple of things that we have done include optimizing the first-time user experience,

643
00:34:46,927 --> 00:34:50,950
where if you know anything about simulation titles, it's that there are heaps to teach

644
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:53,652
players, and we wanted to reduce the number of steps.

645
00:34:55,592 --> 00:34:57,714
The real problem here with Sims FreePlay, I believe,

646
00:34:57,734 --> 00:35:00,956
was that creating another first-time user experience

647
00:35:01,237 --> 00:35:03,138
was a really expensive task.

648
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:05,020
So that's the problem of A-B testing.

649
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,181
If you're going to test something that you've already

650
00:35:06,201 --> 00:35:09,924
spent so much time on, you are much more likely to just go

651
00:35:09,944 --> 00:35:11,625
with the thing that you spent time on anyway.

652
00:35:12,586 --> 00:35:18,330
Fortunately, I believe in this instance, the test cohort was

653
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,851
the winner, but only marginally.

654
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,969
The next thing that we wanted to test was quest progression.

655
00:35:24,829 --> 00:35:27,970
So after five, six years of adding content,

656
00:35:28,791 --> 00:35:31,232
we actually found that we had the problem

657
00:35:31,252 --> 00:35:32,772
of having too much content.

658
00:35:33,012 --> 00:35:35,753
And players were actually not getting to the content.

659
00:35:36,073 --> 00:35:38,054
They were leaving before they saw the cool things.

660
00:35:38,754 --> 00:35:41,815
So we figured, OK, maybe let's shake it up.

661
00:35:41,855 --> 00:35:44,436
Let's try to get players to the content sooner.

662
00:35:44,596 --> 00:35:47,337
And we wanted to shorten the length of time

663
00:35:47,397 --> 00:35:48,677
it took to go through the quest.

664
00:35:50,928 --> 00:35:52,649
So again, this was a quite expensive endeavor,

665
00:35:52,689 --> 00:35:54,470
because you had to change a lot of the tuning,

666
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:55,770
and you had to go through testing

667
00:35:56,211 --> 00:35:57,211
through the entire progression.

668
00:35:58,111 --> 00:36:01,013
Again, here, the winner was the shorter quest,

669
00:36:01,073 --> 00:36:04,354
but however, only marginally, because my suspicion here

670
00:36:04,414 --> 00:36:09,016
is that time it takes is actually just one thing,

671
00:36:09,036 --> 00:36:12,237
one thing that impacts the decision of whether players

672
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:13,818
decide to stay with your game and retain.

673
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,541
Another thing that we optimized was where features were locked.

674
00:36:20,701 --> 00:36:22,703
Again, we had a hypothesis here was

675
00:36:22,743 --> 00:36:25,745
that if we put feature x earlier in the game,

676
00:36:25,985 --> 00:36:28,727
maybe they will retain better because players now

677
00:36:28,767 --> 00:36:30,008
have access to more features.

678
00:36:31,029 --> 00:36:33,610
So this, again, fell into the, I think, again,

679
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,852
we didn't quite realize that we still

680
00:36:35,872 --> 00:36:37,493
had a problem having too much content.

681
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:41,136
So moving more content earlier, again, probably

682
00:36:41,596 --> 00:36:43,157
really didn't do anything in this case.

683
00:36:46,019 --> 00:36:48,601
So another thing worth noting is that be wary of the cost of

684
00:36:48,641 --> 00:36:49,963
testing every small change.

685
00:36:50,503 --> 00:36:53,486
Because every time, at least on Sims 3 Play, it wasn't super

686
00:36:53,506 --> 00:36:54,286
cheap to do everything.

687
00:36:54,326 --> 00:36:56,428
It was reasonably cheap, but it was still time.

688
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:59,811
It was still time setting up the test, figuring out what we

689
00:36:59,831 --> 00:37:02,554
should test, as well as QA time.

690
00:37:10,121 --> 00:37:12,483
So when it came to validating learning.

691
00:37:13,825 --> 00:37:17,888
in the stage of maturity many years down the road,

692
00:37:18,728 --> 00:37:21,971
one of the things that we actually found was very hard

693
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:24,252
was storing the lessons as memories.

694
00:37:26,234 --> 00:37:28,996
So most ideally, you imagine that we're spending years

695
00:37:29,076 --> 00:37:30,757
of doing something and all the mistakes

696
00:37:30,797 --> 00:37:31,738
and lessons that you've learned,

697
00:37:32,198 --> 00:37:34,279
we would like to build on the lessons of the past.

698
00:37:34,299 --> 00:37:37,562
However, this is a major challenge as we age

699
00:37:38,262 --> 00:37:40,023
because team members really, in reality,

700
00:37:40,104 --> 00:37:42,065
do not stay on the title forever.

701
00:37:43,183 --> 00:37:47,946
and that knowledge is normally, you know, disappears with them or at least different

702
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:54,171
bits are left behind but not everything is left behind. This is hard because the team

703
00:37:54,631 --> 00:37:57,353
executes better if they understand why and how we got here.

704
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:01,863
We don't have answers for this.

705
00:38:02,123 --> 00:38:03,665
We don't have great answers at least.

706
00:38:04,105 --> 00:38:07,328
We do have some things that we do with discipline,

707
00:38:07,748 --> 00:38:10,951
like we do an update telemetry review after every update,

708
00:38:10,991 --> 00:38:12,152
looking at our performance,

709
00:38:12,893 --> 00:38:15,615
looking at the things that we've tried and how they perform.

710
00:38:16,696 --> 00:38:18,237
We do some basic documentation,

711
00:38:18,257 --> 00:38:20,199
and we do things like that,

712
00:38:20,219 --> 00:38:21,560
just like as give talks,

713
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:25,303
and hopefully there's some hand-me-down lessons

714
00:38:25,323 --> 00:38:26,965
that the new team members will learn.

715
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:33,481
I really discovered that this was an issue when our team was trying to figure out

716
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:35,462
what can we do with Quest?

717
00:38:35,642 --> 00:38:40,363
And this was seven years in, and I came to the realization that most people had no idea

718
00:38:40,383 --> 00:38:43,244
what had we tried before and what worked, what didn't.

719
00:38:44,244 --> 00:38:48,366
And in fact, a lot of the best practices that we had put in place previously had just been

720
00:38:48,446 --> 00:38:54,007
rolled back because of the different handovers that we had to keep doing as we changed designers,

721
00:38:54,087 --> 00:38:55,048
as we changed PMs.

722
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:59,179
So what we did at least was the PM team put together

723
00:39:01,012 --> 00:39:03,613
all the different analysis that we had done on Quest,

724
00:39:03,653 --> 00:39:05,955
which was heaps, because we had tried anywhere

725
00:39:05,995 --> 00:39:09,097
between 10 to 15 to 20 different new things with Quest

726
00:39:09,157 --> 00:39:10,358
in the course of the years.

727
00:39:10,758 --> 00:39:12,679
And the good part was that they were all documented

728
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,760
in telemetry reviews.

729
00:39:14,321 --> 00:39:18,023
So we created this massive Quest retrospective document,

730
00:39:18,864 --> 00:39:20,565
PowerPoint that we then presented to the team,

731
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,346
explaining what worked, what didn't,

732
00:39:22,446 --> 00:39:25,068
what drove numbers, what did not,

733
00:39:25,188 --> 00:39:26,349
and where the opportunities were.

734
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,091
And we presented it back to the team.

735
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:33,040
And once we did that, we found that at least everyone

736
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:36,662
started with close to the same amount of information, which

737
00:39:36,722 --> 00:39:40,524
then allowed us to then build on top of that in terms of

738
00:39:40,624 --> 00:39:41,485
what else can we do.

739
00:39:42,725 --> 00:39:43,786
But this is a lot of effort.

740
00:39:44,406 --> 00:39:47,768
And this is something that we really have to take into

741
00:39:47,788 --> 00:39:51,269
account as we go through hopefully what will be a very

742
00:39:51,309 --> 00:39:52,070
long life service.

743
00:39:55,107 --> 00:39:57,571
So lesson six, the validated learner.

744
00:39:58,292 --> 00:40:00,095
Every update is an opportunity to learn.

745
00:40:02,158 --> 00:40:03,540
Set up expectations ahead of time

746
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,802
in order to improve your judgment.

747
00:40:06,665 --> 00:40:08,408
A-B testing is generally a really good way

748
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,071
of measuring impact as well as uplift.

749
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:15,680
And lastly, have a good plan to store lessons

750
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,823
so that new team members can avoid making the same mistakes.

751
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:21,085
But granted, sometimes people do have to make mistakes

752
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:21,746
in order to learn.

753
00:40:21,806 --> 00:40:23,208
So this is kind of like, you know,

754
00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:26,551
we just have to figure out how best do we do this.

755
00:40:31,607 --> 00:40:36,170
So the product life cycle is, I guess, a very convenient theory and hypothesis.

756
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:40,913
You'll find that not every game kind of matches it really one-to-one, but that's not really the point.

757
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:45,155
The real challenge, you know, it's not really about knowing how the stages work.

758
00:40:46,136 --> 00:40:52,719
It's actually about knowing how long each stage lasts, because for every game it's different.

759
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,941
Some games, well, unfortunately they don't last very long.

760
00:40:56,061 --> 00:40:58,303
For some games, like some 3Play, they last a long time.

761
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:06,553
And the challenge here is that, you know, if you don't really know how long you're going to be in each stage,

762
00:41:06,694 --> 00:41:10,176
how are you really going to plan and act for the future when you might feel like,

763
00:41:10,196 --> 00:41:12,177
oh yeah, I can be in maturity forever, that's great.

764
00:41:13,278 --> 00:41:16,160
But you know, there's a whole point about knowing the product life cycle,

765
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,021
it's knowing what's next so that you can act now.

766
00:41:19,202 --> 00:41:22,064
Because after maturity, we go into decline.

767
00:41:22,264 --> 00:41:22,484
Here.

768
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:27,611
Your revenue decreases, your costs stay the same,

769
00:41:28,932 --> 00:41:30,112
and your returns reducing.

770
00:41:31,132 --> 00:41:35,633
So it's, you know, the reality is nothing ever stays constant

771
00:41:35,713 --> 00:41:37,734
when there's competition and the market shifts every day.

772
00:41:38,374 --> 00:41:40,555
So it's only natural that we're constantly fighting aging.

773
00:41:41,855 --> 00:41:42,995
Given some sweet place age,

774
00:41:43,095 --> 00:41:46,516
we face declines multiple times, and it's natural,

775
00:41:46,696 --> 00:41:48,697
and we constantly have to fight to stay relevant.

776
00:41:50,137 --> 00:41:52,077
So why do we find ourselves in this state,

777
00:41:52,137 --> 00:41:53,458
and how do we get ourselves out?

778
00:41:55,372 --> 00:41:58,113
So the first is the paradox of strategy.

779
00:41:58,133 --> 00:42:02,654
A strategy works when you're in that life stage,

780
00:42:02,955 --> 00:42:05,356
but then it normally stops working once the context changes.

781
00:42:05,636 --> 00:42:07,836
And context changes can happen when the markets change

782
00:42:07,876 --> 00:42:10,558
in terms of growth, like I showed the chart

783
00:42:10,578 --> 00:42:12,018
of smartphone growth, for instance,

784
00:42:12,038 --> 00:42:13,579
you're clearly not in that state anymore.

785
00:42:13,759 --> 00:42:16,200
Installs are stabilizing, if not decreasing.

786
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,841
The market size, if it stays the same,

787
00:42:20,101 --> 00:42:22,102
preferences change, competitors come up.

788
00:42:23,403 --> 00:42:25,805
And formula reliance is great when you actually

789
00:42:25,825 --> 00:42:27,426
know that you can invest.

790
00:42:27,526 --> 00:42:30,568
But then there's a problem once you move out of that phase.

791
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:34,812
So what happens is that it ironically

792
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:39,035
puts us in a path towards both player and developer fatigue,

793
00:42:39,055 --> 00:42:41,096
where they've been doing the same thing

794
00:42:41,116 --> 00:42:43,859
and expecting the same thing for a long time, when they really

795
00:42:43,939 --> 00:42:44,839
actually want something else.

796
00:42:47,006 --> 00:42:48,406
So the real hard part that we found

797
00:42:48,506 --> 00:42:50,327
is that it's particularly challenging

798
00:42:50,347 --> 00:42:53,487
to build for a difficult stage,

799
00:42:53,647 --> 00:42:55,208
to tell the team, for instance,

800
00:42:55,248 --> 00:42:57,968
like the good days are not gonna stay forever

801
00:42:58,028 --> 00:42:59,689
when you are in the good days, right?

802
00:42:59,709 --> 00:43:02,069
Like that has always been quite hard.

803
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:06,570
So lesson seven is the perpetual challenger,

804
00:43:06,891 --> 00:43:08,251
where we really try to answer

805
00:43:08,291 --> 00:43:11,232
the extremely difficult question of how can we live forever?

806
00:43:13,531 --> 00:43:19,976
And it starts by really acknowledging that after years of doing the same things, or similar

807
00:43:20,016 --> 00:43:22,818
things, or trying new things, that we've built up a legacy.

808
00:43:23,298 --> 00:43:24,839
And the legacy is shackling us.

809
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:30,403
So this is a term that our producer had coined to try to, you know, encourage the team to

810
00:43:30,423 --> 00:43:33,506
think differently, that we have to break the legacy shackles.

811
00:43:35,454 --> 00:43:39,757
The main challenge here is that we are spending development time on things that don't work as well anymore.

812
00:43:39,937 --> 00:43:45,441
Hence, reducing, you know, reduction of our return due to things like weakening foundations.

813
00:43:45,461 --> 00:43:48,003
We are doing the same thing by getting just less in return.

814
00:43:49,223 --> 00:43:54,387
Processes were set up for us to do the same thing over and over, when in reality, we actually should be trying new things.

815
00:43:57,289 --> 00:44:03,933
And we have to overcome inertia by identifying what are the key problems again, which are now different, and build innovative solutions.

816
00:44:05,481 --> 00:44:10,943
So if we can do that, then effectively, you kick us into a new stage of sort of like growth,

817
00:44:11,143 --> 00:44:15,424
but it's what you would term in the product lifecycle as the product extension.

818
00:44:15,844 --> 00:44:19,706
So this kicks us into, you know, gives us more life, it gives us more years.

819
00:44:20,346 --> 00:44:22,247
So how do we do that?

820
00:44:22,267 --> 00:44:27,168
SimCity Play has done this multiple times by developing entirely new features that give

821
00:44:27,668 --> 00:44:28,949
new experiences to players.

822
00:44:30,169 --> 00:44:33,230
And each time that we do that, we are finding more ways to stay relevant.

823
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:41,572
So we do so by embracing reinvention, where our goal

824
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:45,753
here is to take a longer horizon when it comes to

825
00:44:45,793 --> 00:44:46,593
developing features.

826
00:44:46,653 --> 00:44:50,075
We are trying to build something that has longevity

827
00:44:50,135 --> 00:44:55,857
for two to four years, not just let's build something where

828
00:44:55,897 --> 00:44:57,677
players can consume it in the next six weeks.

829
00:44:57,997 --> 00:45:00,978
Because if you do that, then you'll find yourself very

830
00:45:01,018 --> 00:45:02,639
quickly ending up in a decline state.

831
00:45:04,364 --> 00:45:06,225
Next thing is, it's very important to align the team.

832
00:45:06,805 --> 00:45:07,846
You need to stay ambitious.

833
00:45:08,606 --> 00:45:09,367
So that's interesting.

834
00:45:09,387 --> 00:45:11,908
I mean, that's in the maturity phase where you go,

835
00:45:12,248 --> 00:45:13,989
you know what, the numbers are not really moving.

836
00:45:14,029 --> 00:45:16,650
We actually should try to kind of push them harder.

837
00:45:17,751 --> 00:45:19,291
And embracing change in order to get there.

838
00:45:22,347 --> 00:45:25,369
When we develop features, we develop them

839
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:28,212
with the goal of really hitting three different things.

840
00:45:28,832 --> 00:45:32,075
One, they have to hit our hopefully new and ambitious

841
00:45:32,115 --> 00:45:32,715
business goals.

842
00:45:33,396 --> 00:45:36,118
The next is they should hit what the players want,

843
00:45:36,278 --> 00:45:38,700
which we should have figured out by being keen listeners.

844
00:45:39,681 --> 00:45:41,983
And lastly, they should also fix some problems

845
00:45:42,483 --> 00:45:44,825
that we would definitely encounter over time.

846
00:45:45,506 --> 00:45:47,728
So that's ambitious, but you're basically

847
00:45:47,788 --> 00:45:50,450
trying to build something that hits all these three goals.

848
00:45:52,617 --> 00:45:54,839
some features that we've introduced over the years

849
00:45:54,859 --> 00:45:56,721
that have managed to move the needle include

850
00:45:57,461 --> 00:45:59,343
we shipped a new live event system,

851
00:45:59,603 --> 00:46:01,805
where the goal here was to actually remove,

852
00:46:02,705 --> 00:46:04,387
reduce design time substantially,

853
00:46:04,587 --> 00:46:07,489
and allow us to kind of push our content to players

854
00:46:07,549 --> 00:46:08,490
with minimal effort,

855
00:46:09,231 --> 00:46:11,152
while still allowing players to earn lots of content.

856
00:46:11,873 --> 00:46:13,895
So by doing so, we basically were able

857
00:46:13,935 --> 00:46:15,576
to grow the live ops return,

858
00:46:15,816 --> 00:46:19,119
and save a lot on design and code time,

859
00:46:19,139 --> 00:46:22,181
which can be used on feature development.

860
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,082
Another thing that we did was professions,

861
00:46:26,122 --> 00:46:28,183
which we had found was something that players had wanted.

862
00:46:28,203 --> 00:46:30,165
This grew the baseline.

863
00:46:30,485 --> 00:46:32,486
It helped to solve a problem of not

864
00:46:32,546 --> 00:46:37,769
having second-to-second gameplay in the game,

865
00:46:37,789 --> 00:46:40,311
because the game is basically all about appointments.

866
00:46:43,793 --> 00:46:46,375
Next, we built Pregnancy and shipped it last year,

867
00:46:46,435 --> 00:46:48,896
which was one of the most highly demanded features.

868
00:46:49,717 --> 00:46:52,699
Again, the goal here was to grow the baseline

869
00:46:52,779 --> 00:46:53,199
and reduce...

870
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:56,893
reduced amount of effort that we had to spend in maintaining

871
00:46:57,614 --> 00:46:58,855
more event systems.

872
00:46:58,875 --> 00:47:01,818
So here, players could actually, they could just

873
00:47:01,878 --> 00:47:03,660
opt in to a pregnancy event.

874
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:06,983
And they just go, yes, I want to start this pregnancy event.

875
00:47:07,023 --> 00:47:08,084
It lasts for nine days.

876
00:47:08,685 --> 00:47:10,466
And they get to go through the experience of pregnancy.

877
00:47:10,486 --> 00:47:12,208
Or at least the sim gets to go through the experience,

878
00:47:12,388 --> 00:47:14,210
and they get to win cool prizes as a result.

879
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:21,785
The last was the VIP system, which was a hard one to attribute any lifts to,

880
00:47:21,925 --> 00:47:27,209
but what we found was that in the CSATs, lots of spenders actually

881
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:30,012
reviewed that that was one of the key motivations for spending.

882
00:47:30,172 --> 00:47:32,574
So that was actually quite an interesting finding.

883
00:47:35,917 --> 00:47:39,480
So lesson seven, in the state of decline,

884
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:44,865
we're trying to kick ourselves into extending the product.

885
00:47:46,583 --> 00:47:48,764
we really have to be perpetual challengers.

886
00:47:49,884 --> 00:47:52,785
Because firstly, it's too easy to cruise on success,

887
00:47:53,765 --> 00:47:55,526
especially when the good times are here.

888
00:47:56,866 --> 00:47:58,126
And we have to have ambitious goals,

889
00:47:58,387 --> 00:47:59,787
or keep trying to do better,

890
00:47:59,807 --> 00:48:02,868
and have actually good plans on getting there.

891
00:48:04,228 --> 00:48:05,268
It helps to think long haul,

892
00:48:05,448 --> 00:48:07,969
because life service is a marathon, not a sprint.

893
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:13,221
And develop features that satisfy your business goals,

894
00:48:13,301 --> 00:48:16,462
player wants, and fixes the problems of your game.

895
00:48:18,263 --> 00:48:21,624
And lastly, be prepared to face the legacy that has obviously

896
00:48:21,644 --> 00:48:22,444
been built in the game.

897
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:30,827
So there we have it, the seven key lessons

898
00:48:30,847 --> 00:48:32,307
that we've learned over the seven years

899
00:48:32,747 --> 00:48:33,808
across the product lifecycle.

900
00:48:34,857 --> 00:48:35,818
Clearly we've been quite busy.

901
00:48:35,998 --> 00:48:38,781
We've had to set foundations, solve some problems,

902
00:48:39,342 --> 00:48:42,065
invest in growth, keep listening, fixing things,

903
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:43,867
making sure that we're learning

904
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,109
and constantly challenging ourselves.

905
00:48:48,539 --> 00:48:49,719
The lessons have been the blood,

906
00:48:50,139 --> 00:48:51,740
result of the blood, sweat, and tears

907
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,100
of many of the team members

908
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:55,820
who have cycled in and out of the team over these years.

909
00:48:56,621 --> 00:48:58,721
But fortunately, these lessons remain,

910
00:48:59,201 --> 00:49:01,381
and as we get new team members onto the project,

911
00:49:01,881 --> 00:49:04,422
they still continue to actually guide the way we operate.

912
00:49:05,562 --> 00:49:07,843
It's a strong legacy that we've built that keeps us alive,

913
00:49:07,963 --> 00:49:09,863
and hopefully we'll do so for the years to come.

914
00:49:13,904 --> 00:49:16,124
So finally, some key takeaways.

915
00:49:18,927 --> 00:49:21,888
One, the product lifecycle of free-to-play games.

916
00:49:23,629 --> 00:49:25,509
This, at least I personally feel,

917
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:28,791
reflects quite well on what a live service works,

918
00:49:29,031 --> 00:49:30,491
at least in Sims Replay.

919
00:49:30,932 --> 00:49:32,452
Performance actually quite clearly

920
00:49:33,273 --> 00:49:34,613
maps onto this very nicely.

921
00:49:36,794 --> 00:49:38,635
Where we have to understand the stages

922
00:49:38,795 --> 00:49:39,955
and determine the one that you're in.

923
00:49:40,976 --> 00:49:42,176
And then once you understand that,

924
00:49:42,216 --> 00:49:43,837
be prepared for the challenges that are coming

925
00:49:43,957 --> 00:49:45,398
or the challenges that you're already facing.

926
00:49:47,223 --> 00:49:49,964
I've dropped some tidbits about how simulation games actually

927
00:49:49,984 --> 00:49:52,725
work, and primarily they are very content-driven.

928
00:49:53,685 --> 00:49:56,806
And as a result of surviving for longer,

929
00:49:57,026 --> 00:49:58,166
they actually get better over time.

930
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:03,468
Lastly, free-to-play live service is hard but rewarding.

931
00:50:05,904 --> 00:50:08,848
And there really is no recipe for success.

932
00:50:08,948 --> 00:50:10,910
It's just an approach of understanding,

933
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:13,413
this is roughly how a live service is going to work.

934
00:50:13,453 --> 00:50:15,215
This is how the product lifecycle is going to be.

935
00:50:15,235 --> 00:50:18,638
Then how best should I navigate these waters?

936
00:50:18,718 --> 00:50:20,280
Because you'll have different problems.

937
00:50:20,741 --> 00:50:23,023
Your game will have many different issues

938
00:50:23,083 --> 00:50:26,327
that are not issues that, say, a simulation title like Sims

939
00:50:26,387 --> 00:50:27,068
Replay would face.

940
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:30,326
But with the right approach,

941
00:50:31,346 --> 00:50:33,187
hopefully you get to learn multiple lessons

942
00:50:33,827 --> 00:50:35,728
that will both determine your success

943
00:50:35,848 --> 00:50:36,909
as well as shape your future.

944
00:50:42,031 --> 00:50:45,433
So to conclude, finally, well, the at launch

945
00:50:45,593 --> 00:50:47,234
or even before launch, the Sims Replay team,

946
00:50:47,254 --> 00:50:49,635
I don't think a single one of them ever thought

947
00:50:49,655 --> 00:50:51,756
that we could have ever made it this far.

948
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,081
Right?

949
00:50:54,582 --> 00:50:56,964
We never thought that we could turn a premium simulation

950
00:50:56,984 --> 00:51:00,467
sandbox game into a staple that millions of players

951
00:51:00,527 --> 00:51:03,049
continue to play and continue to love.

952
00:51:05,211 --> 00:51:07,472
So if there's anything that you can take from this,

953
00:51:08,033 --> 00:51:12,016
it's really just to be brave, to keep learning,

954
00:51:12,677 --> 00:51:15,599
and then go out there and defy some expectations.

955
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:17,841
Thank you.

956
00:51:25,965 --> 00:51:31,108
I believe we have some time for questions and also a reminder to rate this talk.

957
00:51:37,366 --> 00:51:37,886
I have a question.

958
00:51:38,306 --> 00:51:38,507
Yes.

959
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,968
During the development phase, obviously,

960
00:51:41,988 --> 00:51:43,229
there's a ton of uncertainty.

961
00:51:43,609 --> 00:51:45,810
You don't have that user base to get the information.

962
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:50,892
What would you say are sort of the baseline indicators

963
00:51:50,932 --> 00:51:52,833
and metrics, however sparse they may be,

964
00:51:52,953 --> 00:51:55,354
that you're looking for before you actually launch a game?

965
00:51:57,435 --> 00:52:00,017
Because it would seem kind of like a bet the company kind

966
00:52:00,057 --> 00:52:01,617
of thing to come out with a game without having

967
00:52:01,677 --> 00:52:04,219
some level of understanding about how well the game is

968
00:52:04,259 --> 00:52:04,639
going to do.

969
00:52:04,659 --> 00:52:04,699
So.

970
00:52:07,822 --> 00:52:11,527
Given that, say, you have some reasonable amount of time to sort of build up maybe a

971
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:17,154
smaller user base to kind of learn, what are sort of the things that you would try to hit

972
00:52:17,294 --> 00:52:23,362
before launch or have some trending metrics that would give you a good understanding or

973
00:52:23,482 --> 00:52:26,667
some measure of confidence that the launch is going to be not a complete failure?

974
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:31,616
Yeah, I think when Sims 3Play launched,

975
00:52:31,636 --> 00:52:34,538
that was when there probably wasn't any good best practice

976
00:52:34,638 --> 00:52:35,818
around what to do at launch.

977
00:52:35,858 --> 00:52:39,140
But of course, more recently, at least in the past few years,

978
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:42,362
we do lots of soft launches, or betas, and things like that.

979
00:52:42,382 --> 00:52:43,742
I would say retention is probably the first thing

980
00:52:43,762 --> 00:52:44,383
that you look at.

981
00:52:45,283 --> 00:52:48,225
But like anything, as any product manager would do,

982
00:52:48,425 --> 00:52:50,966
you are making assumptions on everything, like acquisition,

983
00:52:52,187 --> 00:52:54,988
installs, your retention, as well as your monetization.

984
00:52:57,397 --> 00:52:59,198
If you can't keep your players, there's

985
00:52:59,238 --> 00:53:00,639
no way that you can drive any revenue.

986
00:53:00,739 --> 00:53:02,260
So I would say retention is a big one.

987
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,921
But I'm actually personally quite interested

988
00:53:04,941 --> 00:53:07,583
in how do you actually forecast installs or test installs,

989
00:53:08,203 --> 00:53:10,465
which so far, I think there are some ways,

990
00:53:10,505 --> 00:53:13,586
but I haven't quite figured it out.

991
00:53:13,947 --> 00:53:16,388
The way of mitigating that risk is using strong IP,

992
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:19,790
like the SIEMS, which is clearly an advantage that we have.

993
00:53:20,851 --> 00:53:22,272
But definitely, retention will be the thing

994
00:53:22,292 --> 00:53:22,912
that I'll be looking at.

995
00:53:24,212 --> 00:53:29,315
Quick follow-up, is there a specific retention sort of number that you look at or?

996
00:53:30,096 --> 00:53:34,779
Well, it really is, you know, short term and then you go into your mid and then your long. Yeah.

997
00:53:46,206 --> 00:53:47,087
Any other questions?

998
00:53:50,309 --> 00:53:51,289
No, if not,

999
00:53:52,550 --> 00:53:53,551
That's it. Thanks for coming.
