1
00:00:06,156 --> 00:00:10,879
Welcome to Force and Fire, Making Your Game More Metal.

2
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:14,180
And I am Dr. Jeff Howard.

3
00:00:15,241 --> 00:00:16,142
I'm a little out of breath.

4
00:00:16,762 --> 00:00:20,944
And I'm Associate Professor of Game Development and Design

5
00:00:20,964 --> 00:00:23,105
at Dakota State University.

6
00:00:23,706 --> 00:00:25,667
And I've written a couple books.

7
00:00:26,787 --> 00:00:28,208
One is on quest design,

8
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,912
quests, design, theory, and history in games and narratives.

9
00:00:33,813 --> 00:00:35,594
And the other is about magic systems.

10
00:00:35,694 --> 00:00:36,976
It's called Game Magic,

11
00:00:37,616 --> 00:00:40,318
a game designer's guide to constructing magic systems.

12
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:42,380
I'm also the lead designer

13
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,862
of an ongoing project called Arcana,

14
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,525
which is a ceremonial magic simulator,

15
00:00:48,105 --> 00:00:50,487
as well as a tool set for constructing

16
00:00:50,527 --> 00:00:51,608
your own magic systems.

17
00:00:53,393 --> 00:00:56,456
And this talk is about turning it up to 11.

18
00:00:58,757 --> 00:01:01,940
It's about infusing your ordinary leather whip

19
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,303
with abyssal fire, turning it into a metal whip,

20
00:01:06,783 --> 00:01:08,584
a metal flaming chain whip.

21
00:01:09,585 --> 00:01:12,267
And the structure of the talk is going

22
00:01:12,287 --> 00:01:13,968
to take the form of a double LP.

23
00:01:15,938 --> 00:01:19,041
For those of you perhaps not initiated into vinyl culture,

24
00:01:19,942 --> 00:01:24,405
a double LP would be two long playing albums.

25
00:01:24,445 --> 00:01:25,266
That's the LP.

26
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:26,587
That's what LP stands for.

27
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,289
Such as Black Sabbath's We Sold Our Soul for rock and roll.

28
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:33,292
So the first disc would have a side A and a side B.

29
00:01:33,992 --> 00:01:37,455
The second disc would have a side C and a side D.

30
00:01:38,435 --> 00:01:42,639
And the name of this double LP is Force and Fire.

31
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:46,550
Side A, in the beginning, is the song.

32
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:51,473
Side B, the song spawns the word.

33
00:01:53,134 --> 00:01:56,496
Side C, the word forges the world.

34
00:01:57,797 --> 00:02:02,020
And side D, the mechanics energize the world.

35
00:02:03,561 --> 00:02:06,182
This is a fourfold process, but it's

36
00:02:06,223 --> 00:02:09,505
important to remember that this process of making your game

37
00:02:09,565 --> 00:02:10,045
more metal.

38
00:02:10,863 --> 00:02:12,824
It's not strictly linear or one way.

39
00:02:13,505 --> 00:02:15,506
Instead, it's cyclical and intertwined,

40
00:02:16,206 --> 00:02:17,987
like a snake biting its own tail,

41
00:02:18,047 --> 00:02:20,408
or many snakes swirling together

42
00:02:20,448 --> 00:02:22,069
and biting all of their own tails.

43
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:24,110
So you wouldn't have to start with audio

44
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,111
to make a metal game.

45
00:02:25,751 --> 00:02:27,472
You could start with an art style,

46
00:02:28,132 --> 00:02:30,493
or a mechanic, or a story element.

47
00:02:31,154 --> 00:02:33,555
And as long as the experience that you're delivering

48
00:02:34,335 --> 00:02:38,017
is brutally sublime, broodingly gothic,

49
00:02:38,777 --> 00:02:40,098
magically rebellious.

50
00:02:41,016 --> 00:02:41,616
than its metal.

51
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:50,500
But just in terms of history, in the beginning of heavy metal is the song, specifically in

52
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:56,822
the beginning of Steppenwolf, who in their song Born to be Wild said, I like smoke and

53
00:02:56,903 --> 00:03:04,045
lightning, heavy metal thunder, thereby cementing a connection between the rebellious biker

54
00:03:04,266 --> 00:03:09,488
counterculture of the 1960s and a particular musical style.

55
00:03:10,503 --> 00:03:12,666
But metal's been around for a lot longer than that.

56
00:03:13,987 --> 00:03:18,874
Beethoven was eminently metal, as we can hear in Dan Mumm's

57
00:03:18,934 --> 00:03:21,377
version of the Moonlight Sonata.

58
00:03:43,986 --> 00:03:50,043
The Moonlight Sonata is metal before the term exists because of its passion, its intensity,

59
00:03:50,524 --> 00:03:51,968
its sweeping grandeur.

60
00:03:54,344 --> 00:03:59,666
At the same time, it's important to remember that metal is a crossroads.

61
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:06,287
It's a crossroads of culture and geography, Europe, Africa,

62
00:04:06,868 --> 00:04:08,968
Southern America, by way of the blues.

63
00:04:09,488 --> 00:04:14,490
It's a crossroads of time, the ancient, the medieval, the 19th, 20th,

64
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:18,831
and 21st centuries, all converging diabolically,

65
00:04:19,371 --> 00:04:22,372
as in Robert Johnson's Crossroad Blues.

66
00:04:24,232 --> 00:04:30,382
I went to the crossroads, well down on my knees

67
00:04:36,656 --> 00:04:41,418
And while Robert Johnson's acoustic guitar might not immediately suggest metal,

68
00:04:41,978 --> 00:04:46,521
its intervals, its use of an interval called the devil's interval

69
00:04:46,561 --> 00:04:49,422
that we'll get into later, and its subject matter,

70
00:04:50,202 --> 00:04:53,344
the Robert Johnson's partially self-constructed,

71
00:04:54,284 --> 00:04:58,386
semi-autobiographical legend of meeting a dark man at the crossroads

72
00:04:58,426 --> 00:05:02,508
to make a deal, a diabolic pact that would seal his musical fate,

73
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,109
these things are imminently metal.

74
00:05:07,065 --> 00:05:11,728
Indeed, we might speak less of one metal, but of many metals,

75
00:05:12,148 --> 00:05:15,511
of many subgenres and sub-experiences.

76
00:05:16,171 --> 00:05:21,034
And we can circumvent any potential interfactional fights

77
00:05:21,114 --> 00:05:23,856
between these various sub-branches of metal

78
00:05:24,677 --> 00:05:27,379
if we understand that the most important thing is

79
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:29,280
that metal is magic.

80
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,797
And magic is energy.

81
00:05:32,497 --> 00:05:35,818
So when Ronnie James Dio makes the sign of the horns,

82
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:38,439
he says that he learned it from his grandmother,

83
00:05:39,059 --> 00:05:40,180
called it the mallochio.

84
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,321
This is apotropaic magic, the magic

85
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:49,343
of warding off evil energies and drawing energies of power inward.

86
00:05:50,282 --> 00:05:56,608
When Dio says, I cry out for magic, he is invoking energy to suffuse everything he makes.

87
00:05:56,948 --> 00:05:59,891
And this is what we can do as we make our games more metal.

88
00:06:00,972 --> 00:06:06,617
If we begin then with the song, the song can be broken down in part to the riff.

89
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:30,553
A riff is a driving rhythmic motif, a powerful and repeated melody that is instantly memorable

90
00:06:30,773 --> 00:06:31,453
and addictive.

91
00:06:32,213 --> 00:06:38,436
In games, and in game narrative, riffs resemble narrative pacing with steady forward movement

92
00:06:38,696 --> 00:06:45,118
along a critical path, as well as in mechanics, the addictive grind of a repeated core mechanic.

93
00:06:47,758 --> 00:06:53,800
At the same time, the power of the riff is often rooted in dissonant elements, elements

94
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,302
which are deliberately grotesque, horrific, disturbing.

95
00:06:58,322 --> 00:07:03,904
The modus diaboli, an interval, either the diminished fifth or the augmented fourth,

96
00:07:03,944 --> 00:07:08,865
depending how you analyze it, which was outlawed by the medieval Christian church because it

97
00:07:08,905 --> 00:07:14,928
was thought to contain pagan energies, erotic energies, the energy of tension.

98
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:16,888
And you can hear it in this classic.

99
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:20,230
self-titled song, Black Sabbath.

100
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,933
The Devil's Interval reminds us that sometimes,

101
00:07:39,554 --> 00:07:42,657
elements which deliberately do not fit with our whole,

102
00:07:42,717 --> 00:07:43,759
which clash with it,

103
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:47,142
can provoke fascination through their contrasts.

104
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:51,396
And the devil's interval is not the only type of contrast in metal.

105
00:07:51,796 --> 00:07:54,117
Metal revolves around contrast.

106
00:07:54,237 --> 00:07:55,697
It's the essence of its energy.

107
00:07:56,577 --> 00:08:01,139
Riffs provide contrast to solos, bursts of virtuosic, often

108
00:08:01,299 --> 00:08:08,061
neoclassically influenced melody, as in this moment from Bloody Tears

109
00:08:08,401 --> 00:08:11,722
from the soundtrack of Castlevania II, Simon's Quest.

110
00:08:31,884 --> 00:08:38,427
And you can hear it, that delicate beauty amid the violence and the horror of the riff.

111
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:45,126
Once the song is firmly in place, the song spawns the word.

112
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:49,567
It can inspire lyrics and other verbal elements.

113
00:08:50,348 --> 00:08:54,209
The song is generative in the sense of procedural generation

114
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:56,509
and different types of metal will inspire

115
00:08:56,949 --> 00:08:59,070
different lyrical flights of fancy,

116
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,510
whether it is the high fantasy of power metal

117
00:09:02,951 --> 00:09:07,932
with much soaring triumphantly on the backs of unicorns

118
00:09:08,392 --> 00:09:09,892
or whether it's more doom metal.

119
00:09:10,492 --> 00:09:13,354
reveling in brutality and the grotesque.

120
00:09:16,415 --> 00:09:22,577
One example of this potential of the song to generate the word,

121
00:09:22,597 --> 00:09:27,859
to spawn the word, is Paradise Lost, John Milton's Paradise Lost,

122
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:31,721
which in some sense is the ultimate metal poem.

123
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:36,503
And you can see the generative power of Milton's epic poem,

124
00:09:36,683 --> 00:09:37,863
which he regarded as song.

125
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:44,049
in a random Twitter bot tweeting lines from various books of Paradise Lost,

126
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:49,255
and any one of those lines could serve as the title for a metal album,

127
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:53,780
or part of it could be used as a metal band, or even...

128
00:09:54,801 --> 00:10:00,064
The dialogue or item descriptions from a metal-inspired game.

129
00:10:00,524 --> 00:10:06,488
Into this wild abyss the weary fiend stood on the brink of hell and looked a while,

130
00:10:06,968 --> 00:10:10,571
pondering his voyage, for no narrow firth he had to cross,

131
00:10:10,891 --> 00:10:15,474
nor was his ear less peeled with noises loud and ruinous.

132
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:22,549
this inspiring power of the story of the Devil's Rebellion,

133
00:10:23,071 --> 00:10:24,034
the Rebel Angel.

134
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:33,192
is a heavy metal archetype whose power has not been lost on heavy metal musicians and the creators of their visual art,

135
00:10:33,392 --> 00:10:34,933
their merchandise, and their posters.

136
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:43,196
And while Led Zeppelin's poster may be as much the fall of Icarus as the fall of Lucifer,

137
00:10:43,616 --> 00:10:49,898
Black Sabbath has clearly embraced the Miltonic vision of the rebel angel.

138
00:10:50,887 --> 00:10:58,777
But these are all signs and portents foreshadowing the figure of Raziel, who was cast down from

139
00:10:58,877 --> 00:11:05,306
Soul Reaver 2, in which the generative power of Milton's song has become a reality.

140
00:11:06,226 --> 00:11:11,788
even more powerful through the work of Amy Hennig, who takes the name Raziel from the

141
00:11:11,909 --> 00:11:18,691
Apocrypha, who weaves together strands of Gnosticism and Lovecraft to suggest that the

142
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:24,714
god of Nosgoth is in fact an evil, oppressive Demiurge.

143
00:11:25,334 --> 00:11:32,237
And the logic of that cosmic metaphysical rebellion against the very laws of the multiverse

144
00:11:32,297 --> 00:11:32,817
themselves.

145
00:11:33,964 --> 00:11:43,699
inspires, inspires tales, it functions almost as a generator through its logic of rebellion.

146
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,508
And so what we're looking at is a diagram of the great Andrew Plotkin, aka Zarf.

147
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:58,351
who created timelines of the many forking and intertwining tales of rebellion and vampiric

148
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:05,294
possession and demonic imbuing of weapons that run throughout the multiverse of the

149
00:12:05,354 --> 00:12:09,655
Soul Reaver 2 series, infusing it with metal energy.

150
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:19,137
I would suggest that the reason why this tale of the rebellion of a fallen angel resonates

151
00:12:19,277 --> 00:12:26,223
with heavy metal musicians and game writers alike is William Blake's insight.

152
00:12:26,423 --> 00:12:31,287
The reason Milton wrote in fetters when he wrote of angels and God and at liberty when

153
00:12:31,307 --> 00:12:37,091
of devils and hell is because he was a true poet and of the devil's party without knowing

154
00:12:37,151 --> 00:12:37,191
it.

155
00:12:38,282 --> 00:12:45,153
We have been taught in countless game writing workshops to rein in our deathless prose,

156
00:12:45,694 --> 00:12:52,725
to kill our darlings, and while an editorial voice is certainly a useful thing to have,

157
00:12:53,547 --> 00:12:58,889
a little bit of Sturm und Drang, a little bit of breaking out of our strictures and

158
00:12:58,949 --> 00:13:03,851
limitations, our players will thank us for it, because it will infuse their experience

159
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:04,811
with energy.

160
00:13:05,091 --> 00:13:09,013
In Blake's definition, evil is when we call a riff evil.

161
00:13:09,713 --> 00:13:16,216
Evil is the active springing from energy, and good is anything that tries to restrict

162
00:13:16,276 --> 00:13:16,896
that energy.

163
00:13:17,577 --> 00:13:22,899
If we listen too much to those who would restrict our energy and our rebellion.

164
00:13:23,777 --> 00:13:29,178
we become pawns of the false god Drew who hates Dark Souls.

165
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:38,760
As in the horrific tale of the writer will do something in which Drew is an obnoxious

166
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:45,202
fictionalized producer whose marketing research suggests that no one should use Dark Souls

167
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:50,863
as an inspiration, even if it would be highly useful in helping to bring a team together

168
00:13:51,043 --> 00:13:52,083
in its narrative design.

169
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:59,784
In contrast to this negative horror story is the narrative implied by Darkest Dungeon

170
00:14:00,265 --> 00:14:03,207
in which a put-upon scribe

171
00:14:04,264 --> 00:14:06,566
gives into the power of his own madness.

172
00:14:07,327 --> 00:14:08,227
And in so doing,

173
00:14:08,808 --> 00:14:11,371
takes a more active and directing role

174
00:14:11,871 --> 00:14:12,472
in design.

175
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:14,013
Narrative design

176
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:17,437
that pulls together art elements and mechanical elements

177
00:14:17,997 --> 00:14:19,419
and audio elements

178
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:20,960
to create a whole

179
00:14:21,441 --> 00:14:23,122
that is greater than the sum of its parts.

180
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:24,704
And in this whole,

181
00:14:25,748 --> 00:14:27,189
Writing is not neglected.

182
00:14:27,729 --> 00:14:30,470
Writing is allowed to soar majestically.

183
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,871
Darkness closes in, haunting the hearts of men.

184
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:37,872
And now the darkness holds dominion, black as death,

185
00:14:38,392 --> 00:14:40,413
teetering on the brink facing the abyss,

186
00:14:40,953 --> 00:14:44,354
as life ebbs, terrible vistas of emptiness

187
00:14:44,834 --> 00:14:45,734
reveal themselves.

188
00:14:46,055 --> 00:14:48,155
These are bursts of blackened prose.

189
00:14:49,131 --> 00:14:51,372
like the riff that pervade the game,

190
00:14:51,732 --> 00:14:53,933
deathly intertwined with its mechanics,

191
00:14:54,613 --> 00:14:57,255
often indicating state changes as characters

192
00:14:57,775 --> 00:15:00,276
lose and gain afflictions

193
00:15:00,296 --> 00:15:04,418
in various other dark forms of romantic madness.

194
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:07,859
And sometimes, the writers of Darkest Dungeon

195
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:09,420
engage in a solo.

196
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,001
They let themselves go free to write

197
00:15:12,021 --> 00:15:15,242
a majestic Lovecraftian monologue

198
00:15:16,063 --> 00:15:17,343
that can fill entire pages.

199
00:15:18,814 --> 00:15:23,561
And when we do this, the Word can inspire our visual artists.

200
00:15:23,601 --> 00:15:26,365
The Word forges a vision of the world.

201
00:15:27,697 --> 00:15:36,285
As in the work of Iron Maiden's cover artist, Eddie Riggs, whose cover for Life After Death

202
00:15:36,445 --> 00:15:44,052
and all of his Iron Maiden covers involve a rebellious mascot named Eddie who is breaking

203
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:50,718
free of chains, sometimes even the chains of death, always inspired by the lyrics of

204
00:15:50,858 --> 00:15:51,899
Iron Maiden's songs.

205
00:15:53,678 --> 00:15:57,580
which can move through a variety of settings and suggest a variety of worlds

206
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:04,344
from ancient Egyptian to Bedlam to futuristic cyberpunk world.

207
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:11,408
The key here is that music and lyrics are helping visual artists to create worlds.

208
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:14,970
And when those worlds are so richly created...

209
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:20,060
They function as generators for not one game, but for multiple,

210
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:25,082
for Power Slave, for Iron Maiden's Ed Hunter, most recently for Iron Maiden

211
00:16:25,162 --> 00:16:29,905
Legacy of the Beast, a mobile game, a mobile game on your phone in which

212
00:16:30,305 --> 00:16:34,907
every aspect of the game, from its loading screens to its progress bars

213
00:16:34,967 --> 00:16:40,690
to its upgrades, is suffused with the metal energy of Maiden's lyrics

214
00:16:41,391 --> 00:16:44,032
and visual art and audio.

215
00:16:44,952 --> 00:16:51,117
This is what it feels like to live inside the world of a metal album cover.

216
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:58,183
What is required here is not just art, but art direction, art in the style of a particular

217
00:16:58,243 --> 00:17:03,747
something designed to create a particular effect, as in Pusshead's work on Damage Incorporated,

218
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:07,110
which became a game by Paranoid Productions.

219
00:17:08,251 --> 00:17:10,793
But there isn't simply one metal visual style.

220
00:17:10,813 --> 00:17:12,114
There's many ways to look metal.

221
00:17:12,575 --> 00:17:15,037
Could be the psychedelia of Skinner

222
00:17:15,097 --> 00:17:16,799
in his video for the Black Plot.

223
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:22,223
It could be the art nouveau stylings of Florian Bertmer.

224
00:17:22,664 --> 00:17:27,408
It could be the print monotypes on parchment of Karamazov.

225
00:17:27,648 --> 00:17:31,572
All these are metal for their world building.

226
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:35,893
This has not been lost on the fan communities of various

227
00:17:37,174 --> 00:17:41,836
metal-inspired games, so that at least two and many more

228
00:17:42,216 --> 00:17:45,838
metal t-shirts have emerged out of the universe of Dark Souls,

229
00:17:46,758 --> 00:17:50,480
so that the battles with various bosses become

230
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:55,462
death metal t-shirts, and Ceaseless Discharge, the most death metal name ever,

231
00:17:55,882 --> 00:17:58,803
directly taken from one of the bosses in Dark Souls.

232
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:04,993
And Slain, Back From Hell, describes by its developers

233
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:07,475
as an interactive heavy metal album cover.

234
00:18:08,235 --> 00:18:12,098
The reason this works is because there's a soundtrack

235
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:15,401
by former Celtic Frost bassist, Kurt Victor Bryant.

236
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:21,014
And there is Art Direction by Andrew Gilmore, a self-described metal goth.

237
00:18:21,295 --> 00:18:26,200
And through this collaboration between these two individuals across disciplines, they're

238
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:30,926
able to forge a metal vision that is greater than the sum of its parts.

239
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:38,992
When we build metal worlds, we're often thinking in terms of tableau, less of linear plots and more as brief episodes.

240
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:46,458
Here now, the Requiem of Blood in Castlevania, Rondo of Blood, Castlevania Drascula X,

241
00:18:46,598 --> 00:18:51,682
in which a naked succubus rides on the back of a skull that shoots laser beams.

242
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:59,000
or in which our protagonist leaps on the back of a horse-drawn hearse

243
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,081
and does whip-based battle against the Grim Reaper himself

244
00:19:03,421 --> 00:19:06,522
atop the corpses of thy brethren, literally,

245
00:19:07,122 --> 00:19:12,043
giving us the feeling of what it would be like to live inside of King Diamond's Abigail album.

246
00:19:12,983 --> 00:19:15,164
When we're building these sorts of metal worlds,

247
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:21,946
at the highest level, there are four traits or attributes that define a metal world.

248
00:19:22,606 --> 00:19:23,226
The sublime...

249
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:27,581
the gothic, the weird, and the grimdark.

250
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:35,853
The sublime refers to an aesthetic experience beyond human comprehension, a vision of natural

251
00:19:35,913 --> 00:19:39,894
and cosmic grandeur in which human beings are insignificant.

252
00:19:40,214 --> 00:19:44,795
Looking down over the edge of that canyon, not only does it dwarf the man looking down

253
00:19:44,835 --> 00:19:51,157
into it, but a single step would kill him, and in that danger is the power of the sublime.

254
00:19:51,837 --> 00:19:58,398
The gothic, featuring wild landscapes, ruined architecture, supernatural horror.

255
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:05,803
Ravenloft is metal, because Ravenloft is gothic, directly derived from the gothic.

256
00:20:05,883 --> 00:20:10,367
It's the gothic pocket dimension of the Dungeons and Dragons universe.

257
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:18,533
Innistrad is metal, because its cards are a machine for generatively combining gothic

258
00:20:18,653 --> 00:20:21,675
elements in the Magic the Gathering multiverse.

259
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:24,797
The Shire is not metal.

260
00:20:30,192 --> 00:20:33,002
But ringwraiths are metal as fuck.

261
00:20:37,224 --> 00:20:46,311
Michael Moorcock fused together the traits of epic fantasy with those of weird fiction

262
00:20:46,471 --> 00:20:53,215
in his Elric saga, producing a world that is decadent, psychedelic, mind-warping.

263
00:20:53,656 --> 00:20:59,500
In the words of Alan Moore, Elric's Melnibony is warped with a touch of fractal horrors

264
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,962
and fluoresces with toxic elf repellent.

265
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:05,384
Melnibony is metal.

266
00:21:06,554 --> 00:21:09,876
And Warhammer 40K, it's very metal.

267
00:21:11,016 --> 00:21:14,317
It is, its motto is that in the grim darkness

268
00:21:14,377 --> 00:21:16,698
of the far future, there is only war.

269
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:20,420
And out of this motto comes the aesthetic trait

270
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:25,202
of grimdark and an entire anti-Tolkien movement

271
00:21:25,262 --> 00:21:27,443
of fantasy from George R.R. Martin

272
00:21:27,963 --> 00:21:31,205
to Mark Lawrence's Broken Empire series.

273
00:21:31,845 --> 00:21:35,426
And when we fuse these aspects of metal worlds together,

274
00:21:36,814 --> 00:21:46,180
we get Yharnam in Bloodborne, which is gothic, grimdark, weird, and sublimely metal.

275
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:51,150
We could take a cue here from Dan Pinchbeck's excellent book on doom,

276
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:55,513
which he titled Scary Dark Fast, to suggest that all three of those words

277
00:21:55,873 --> 00:21:59,416
become one word, because doom is characterized

278
00:21:59,836 --> 00:22:03,699
by one unified experience that fuses all of those traits.

279
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,781
We might say, taking a page from Pinchbeck,

280
00:22:07,442 --> 00:22:10,144
that metal is defined by gothic weird sublime.

281
00:22:11,221 --> 00:22:15,467
And this is certainly true at the macro level of the overall world,

282
00:22:16,048 --> 00:22:21,196
but it's also true at the micro level, at the level of level design.

283
00:22:22,629 --> 00:22:27,351
Metal level design is a surreal non-Euclidean nightmare.

284
00:22:28,071 --> 00:22:31,153
It is the castle and the inverted castle

285
00:22:31,633 --> 00:22:33,394
of Castlevania Symphony of the Night,

286
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:36,416
threatening always to topple over on itself

287
00:22:36,876 --> 00:22:38,957
in its involuted, twisting hallways,

288
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,960
or the Winchester house-like stairways to nowhere

289
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,542
in the second level of the Tower of Latria from Demon's Souls.

290
00:22:48,463 --> 00:22:49,643
Metal level design.

291
00:22:50,665 --> 00:22:58,670
is the architecture of madness. Always different, yet somehow always the same, as in the many

292
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:05,574
iterations of Castle Ravenloft, its spires corkscrewing off into the void.

293
00:23:07,856 --> 00:23:14,060
And for a level design, for a world to draw our players in, to energize them,

294
00:23:14,841 --> 00:23:18,805
It is ultimately the role of mechanics to energize the world.

295
00:23:19,426 --> 00:23:24,911
But we have to understand that for a level to be fully metal...

296
00:23:25,877 --> 00:23:29,800
It's not enough for the gameplay to be simply brutal,

297
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:34,223
to be Kratos diving in willy-nilly with his chain blades.

298
00:23:34,903 --> 00:23:37,345
There is the riff, and it is brutal,

299
00:23:37,825 --> 00:23:39,446
but there is also the solo,

300
00:23:40,047 --> 00:23:44,029
and the solo is above all elegant and graceful.

301
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,311
So that Devil Daggers, one of the most metal games,

302
00:23:48,032 --> 00:23:53,994
of the last year at least has the rhythms of the riff and the grace of the solo. It's

303
00:23:54,034 --> 00:24:02,378
a ballet of circle strafing and explosions of fire. Which brings us back to the title

304
00:24:02,418 --> 00:24:10,082
of this talk. Which comes from an invocation of the occultist Alistair Crowley who intoned

305
00:24:10,102 --> 00:24:16,865
about me flames my father's face, the star of force and fire.

306
00:24:18,085 --> 00:24:20,546
Crowley is begging for magic.

307
00:24:20,586 --> 00:24:23,047
He's calling it down, commanding it down.

308
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:27,589
And when we pull it down into our world,

309
00:24:28,129 --> 00:24:32,391
it can infuse the entire thing with abyssal fires,

310
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:36,373
as in this flaming pentagram from Doom 3.

311
00:24:38,674 --> 00:24:42,235
I urge you then to go forth

312
00:24:44,256 --> 00:24:44,376
and

313
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:53,247
at play in the contrary between your inner editorial voices and the energy of infinite

314
00:24:53,307 --> 00:24:58,692
cosmic rebellion, I urge you to go forth and live deliciously.

315
00:25:02,495 --> 00:25:05,338
And we might have time for a question or two.

316
00:25:14,652 --> 00:25:18,315
And if we run out of time, I'll be over in the wrap-up room.

317
00:25:19,076 --> 00:25:22,799
It's 3014, and I'd love to talk to people about Metal Games.

318
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,021
Do we have time for a question or two?

319
00:25:26,863 --> 00:25:27,563
About three minutes.

320
00:25:27,704 --> 00:25:27,984
OK.

321
00:25:28,484 --> 00:25:29,205
So sure.

322
00:25:29,845 --> 00:25:31,707
If anybody's got anything, I'd love to jam.

323
00:25:36,696 --> 00:25:43,822
So, in most of your examples, you have like a complete diegetic world that is metal from

324
00:25:43,882 --> 00:25:44,363
inch to inch.

325
00:25:45,924 --> 00:25:51,509
But my curiosity is when you encounter like in Overwatch, for example, you have this character

326
00:25:51,529 --> 00:25:57,095
of Reaper or you have this emergent genre of like cute metal with baby metal in Japan

327
00:25:57,135 --> 00:25:59,237
and like these other manipulations of genre.

328
00:25:59,817 --> 00:26:00,157
Is this...

329
00:26:01,505 --> 00:26:07,608
Do you think that the appeal here is the same appeal as completely saturated metal, or is

330
00:26:07,648 --> 00:26:11,791
this sort of like interacting with other genres, having a counterplay?

331
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:17,815
Yeah, so the question there, you know, does an entire metal world have to be suffused

332
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:22,317
by metal, or is it possible that some of the energy could come from the contrast of metal

333
00:26:22,337 --> 00:26:23,358
and non-metal elements?

334
00:26:23,638 --> 00:26:24,979
And I think both are possible.

335
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:26,540
I think metal is inherently...

336
00:26:27,958 --> 00:26:30,159
energized by contraries and contradictions,

337
00:26:30,219 --> 00:26:32,261
so the riff and the solo dialectic,

338
00:26:32,701 --> 00:26:34,863
but you could have something like,

339
00:26:35,843 --> 00:26:38,465
called, you know, my little pony souls,

340
00:26:38,565 --> 00:26:39,746
friendship is darkness.

341
00:26:40,347 --> 00:26:43,789
And which I believe actually is a meme somewhere,

342
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:44,630
I'm pretty sure it is.

343
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:47,512
And there, what we're simply doing is

344
00:26:47,892 --> 00:26:50,974
creating a stronger contrast between the good and the evil,

345
00:26:51,315 --> 00:26:53,216
the energy and that which puts a boundary

346
00:26:53,256 --> 00:26:54,337
outward circumference around it.

347
00:26:54,397 --> 00:26:55,197
So both are possible.

348
00:26:55,798 --> 00:26:56,439
Excellent, thank you.

349
00:26:56,999 --> 00:26:58,681
Thank you, yeah.

350
00:26:59,062 --> 00:27:03,146
Yeah, a question on a similar vein, I think.

351
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:08,032
So even this My Little Pony's example, it's still mixing

352
00:27:08,933 --> 00:27:12,216
something that is not metal with something that is metal,

353
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,058
but that metal still just seems aesthetic.

354
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:15,640
So like.

355
00:27:17,907 --> 00:27:21,408
How does this idea work with something that doesn't have the aesthetic of metal?

356
00:27:21,428 --> 00:27:23,369
Like what, is that just not metal?

357
00:27:23,829 --> 00:27:26,570
Like can a game be metal but not have any of the aesthetic?

358
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:27,630
Yes.

359
00:27:28,851 --> 00:27:32,252
So the question is, is it possible for a game to sort of have the spirit of

360
00:27:32,332 --> 00:27:34,713
metal even if none of its elements individually

361
00:27:35,513 --> 00:27:38,954
would be recognized by themselves as aesthetically metal? And I guess like to

362
00:27:38,974 --> 00:27:40,275
that, what is that?

363
00:27:40,955 --> 00:27:43,116
What is the spirit of metal without the aesthetic?

364
00:27:44,364 --> 00:27:50,449
I think that the spirit of metal is the energy of cosmic rebellion, and cosmic rebellion

365
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:55,134
would not have to take the form of something that's loud or brutal or dark.

366
00:27:55,654 --> 00:28:03,301
So if the cosmos in which someone exists is ruled by metal deities, then it would be a

367
00:28:03,361 --> 00:28:07,465
form of metaphysical rebellion to worship Steven Universe.

368
00:28:08,265 --> 00:28:13,689
or to be part of Eternia's power of friendship.

369
00:28:13,769 --> 00:28:16,091
So I think it's the rebellion and the energy that's key,

370
00:28:16,791 --> 00:28:18,932
and when we recognize that that rebellion is cosmic

371
00:28:19,473 --> 00:28:23,395
and not sort of inherently violent,

372
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:25,997
then I think that's how something

373
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:28,579
with no explicitly metal elements

374
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:29,740
could nonetheless have the spirit of metal.

375
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,281
Okay, thanks.
