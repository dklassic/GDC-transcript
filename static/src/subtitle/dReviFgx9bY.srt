1
00:00:05,945 --> 00:00:06,757
Good afternoon, everybody.

2
00:00:06,818 --> 00:00:07,427
How's everyone doing?

3
00:00:08,945 --> 00:00:14,206
I'm going to go ahead and say that we're going to break the flow of the presentation near

4
00:00:14,226 --> 00:00:17,027
the very end because the PowerPoint gods hate me.

5
00:00:17,667 --> 00:00:21,227
And so just close your eyes and we'll go and we'll transition into it.

6
00:00:21,307 --> 00:00:27,749
But I'm here today to talk to you about live operations in Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes.

7
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:33,570
For those of you that aren't familiar with it, Galaxy of Heroes is a mid to hardcore

8
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,190
mobile character collection game with RPG progression elements.

9
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,871
Say that five times fast.

10
00:00:40,132 --> 00:00:46,315
I was asked to talk about, originally, about our live events and about what we do and how we do them.

11
00:00:47,235 --> 00:00:52,958
And the more I dug into it, the more the presentation originally started to look like,

12
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,681
ah, and here's this event that requires these characters and it yields X thing.

13
00:00:57,701 --> 00:00:58,441
And that wasn't...

14
00:00:59,302 --> 00:01:02,523
Really satisfying in the way that I had hoped that it would be.

15
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:05,004
And so instead, after digging a bit more,

16
00:01:05,124 --> 00:01:07,585
I decided instead that it might be better to approach this as

17
00:01:07,605 --> 00:01:10,827
a post-mortem, with a little bit of theory and philosophy,

18
00:01:11,027 --> 00:01:13,368
and then at the very end sort of touch on our mechanics

19
00:01:14,448 --> 00:01:17,469
and how we deploy sort of the solutions from this philosophy

20
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:22,552
into the way that we make and design live events.

21
00:01:22,692 --> 00:01:24,673
And so, but before I spend 30 minutes

22
00:01:24,713 --> 00:01:26,313
just showing off my sweet key art...

23
00:01:27,374 --> 00:01:28,355
Let's go ahead and hop in.

24
00:01:28,395 --> 00:01:32,638
And one of the things you're going to notice immediately in this presentation is the power

25
00:01:32,778 --> 00:01:33,459
of three.

26
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,064
Star Wars has a lot of trilogies, and so I thought it was pretty appropriate to also

27
00:01:39,124 --> 00:01:41,265
have the number three show up quite a bit.

28
00:01:41,305 --> 00:01:45,029
And so the way this talk is going to be lined out is that we're going to do some introductions.

29
00:01:45,169 --> 00:01:45,669
Who am I?

30
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:46,470
Who sent me?

31
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:47,330
What do they do?

32
00:01:48,011 --> 00:01:51,214
I'm going to talk about the product, Galaxy of Heroes itself.

33
00:01:51,774 --> 00:01:52,715
And then we're going to talk about...

34
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:57,926
The three fundamental pillars of the game, and the three problems that come from those

35
00:01:57,966 --> 00:02:02,068
three fundamental pillars, and the three solutions to the three problems from the three fundamental

36
00:02:02,108 --> 00:02:02,469
pillars.

37
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:05,651
And then the three mechanics to the three solutions to the three problems from the three

38
00:02:05,691 --> 00:02:06,411
fundamental pillars.

39
00:02:07,171 --> 00:02:10,493
Sort of a nesting doll of Star Wars-y goodness.

40
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:13,235
So, moving forward.

41
00:02:14,285 --> 00:02:18,410
If it will let me. I want to give a big shout out to my team more than anything else.

42
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:22,475
These are the people that make Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes happen every day, all day,

43
00:02:22,836 --> 00:02:28,363
and some other like sports preppy stuff. But more than anything, for those of you up there,

44
00:02:28,563 --> 00:02:31,447
if I ruin this, I'm so sorry for besmirching your good names.

45
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:34,029
So, who am I?

46
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,970
My name is Nick Reinhart.

47
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:37,772
On the forums I go by Top Hat.

48
00:02:38,112 --> 00:02:39,213
See that Vader with the top hat?

49
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:40,513
That's me.

50
00:02:41,774 --> 00:02:46,958
My schooling background is that I have a BA in political science and an MA in international

51
00:02:46,978 --> 00:02:50,160
relations, which means I functionally have two holes in my head.

52
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,743
And I also have an MS in statistics, which feels like a real degree, maybe.

53
00:02:57,064 --> 00:03:13,949
I did some unfun jobs for a long time, like a lot of them, but I think most recently the most unfun was I worked in the oil industry where I did compliance and logistics. And yes, it is that dismal. It is that dismal sounding. I also worked in the government where I worked for the Agency for International Development.

54
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:16,731
On a joint task force with the State Department.

55
00:03:17,332 --> 00:03:18,573
That work was actually really cool.

56
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:21,655
I worked on the Bureau for Europe and Eurasia desk,

57
00:03:21,715 --> 00:03:23,317
and we came up with some really cool things,

58
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:24,418
but it was a little too slow,

59
00:03:24,678 --> 00:03:26,099
and outside of my core competency,

60
00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:27,760
which was mainly playing video games.

61
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:30,823
And so, then I did some fun jobs.

62
00:03:31,243 --> 00:03:32,925
I started working as a data scientist,

63
00:03:32,985 --> 00:03:35,367
which is another job that's sort of made up.

64
00:03:35,787 --> 00:03:37,649
Data scientists make up a lot of models

65
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:38,630
that no one looks at.

66
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:39,390
But they do.

67
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,651
And then you use like one or two of them.

68
00:03:41,811 --> 00:03:42,511
And they're pretty cool.

69
00:03:42,591 --> 00:03:44,912
But one of them we did use, and we'll talk about it later.

70
00:03:45,432 --> 00:03:47,233
I also worked as a product manager.

71
00:03:48,053 --> 00:03:50,094
And what a product manager inside of Electronic Arts is,

72
00:03:50,154 --> 00:03:52,434
is they're responsible for monetization design,

73
00:03:52,515 --> 00:03:53,915
balancing the economy, et cetera.

74
00:03:54,555 --> 00:03:56,376
But currently, I am a car salesman,

75
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,237
also known as a live producer.

76
00:03:58,897 --> 00:04:01,498
And so what I do is I'm specifically in charge

77
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:03,598
of the live game, meaning my team owns

78
00:04:03,638 --> 00:04:06,680
making the game feel fresh and alive every day.

79
00:04:07,797 --> 00:04:11,507
We accomplished this largely through releasing new characters, ships, and you guessed it,

80
00:04:12,048 --> 00:04:12,329
events.

81
00:04:13,312 --> 00:04:16,159
So here are all the other games that I've worked on.

82
00:04:19,816 --> 00:04:21,217
It's a lot.

83
00:04:21,357 --> 00:04:23,279
So take this with a grain of salt,

84
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:24,220
all the things I'm saying.

85
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,061
I know that I am new to the industry and what I do.

86
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:28,783
But I hope that what I'm saying resonates with you all.

87
00:04:29,824 --> 00:04:31,246
So let me tell you a little bit about Capital Games.

88
00:04:32,226 --> 00:04:34,869
So Capital Games got established in 2008.

89
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,332
You can see that there is a Mochi store in that picture.

90
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:42,295
The development happened above the Mochi store.

91
00:04:42,395 --> 00:04:42,795
That's right.

92
00:04:43,756 --> 00:04:48,720
Back in the wild days of Facebook games, they were cranking out all sorts of crazy things.

93
00:04:48,781 --> 00:04:53,565
And so eventually, after having some success there, they moved into that middle picture,

94
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:58,970
which is actually where we still currently reside to this day, which is Capital Games proper,

95
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:02,873
although we're in the process of actually moving into a new building and starting another project.

96
00:05:04,154 --> 00:05:08,515
Because of the success in some of their Facebook games, most notably Superhero City, ClickNation

97
00:05:08,535 --> 00:05:13,877
was acquired by Electronic Arts in December 2011, where, if you do or do not remember,

98
00:05:14,057 --> 00:05:16,097
they released a game called Heroes of Dragon Age.

99
00:05:16,137 --> 00:05:18,578
And let's go ahead and take a look at some of those real quick.

100
00:05:18,598 --> 00:05:23,179
On the far left, that's Superhero City, and on the far right is Heroes of Dragon Age.

101
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:26,180
Look at the far right picture, because you can actually see...

102
00:05:27,304 --> 00:05:30,010
So much of the DNA that's Galaxy of Heroes show up right there.

103
00:05:33,922 --> 00:05:40,263
The team as a whole has largely worked on RPG sort of core experiences for a very long time.

104
00:05:40,283 --> 00:05:45,064
And in many ways, the studio is just a reflection of all those previous games that have come and gone.

105
00:05:45,564 --> 00:05:49,485
And Galaxy of Heroes is the culmination of that, hopefully, great experience.

106
00:05:49,565 --> 00:05:51,105
Yes, excellent, great experience.

107
00:05:51,686 --> 00:05:54,026
So let's go on.

108
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:55,586
So let's talk about the product.

109
00:05:55,626 --> 00:05:57,727
And let's talk about Galaxy of Heroes more proper.

110
00:05:58,347 --> 00:05:58,487
So...

111
00:06:00,606 --> 00:06:04,788
So take a look at this picture and just close your eyes, let it come over here.

112
00:06:05,148 --> 00:06:09,850
There's this feeling that comes from watching a Star Wars movie that is difficult to describe,

113
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,090
but we all know it.

114
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:17,373
It's a sense of fantastic and wonder, and it goes beyond just watching the movies.

115
00:06:17,973 --> 00:06:20,154
Most of us probably have a cherished Star Wars memory.

116
00:06:20,894 --> 00:06:22,675
Mine, I'm from Alabama originally.

117
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,276
That's an okay place.

118
00:06:25,697 --> 00:06:28,058
In the backwoods of Alabama, we're out tromping around in the woods.

119
00:06:28,178 --> 00:06:32,522
Me and my buddy, we're trying to force lift a log so that we can prove to a stump, Yoda,

120
00:06:32,722 --> 00:06:34,403
that we're actually, we could be Jedi.

121
00:06:35,364 --> 00:06:39,326
But in that same vein, so many of us grew up playing with the toys.

122
00:06:39,807 --> 00:06:43,790
And while this picture is clearly from the 70s, I'm willing to bet that most of us played

123
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:44,390
with the toys.

124
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,192
Galaxy of Heroes is an extension of that toy experience.

125
00:06:48,253 --> 00:06:50,394
It's a sandbox where you can mix and match

126
00:06:50,434 --> 00:06:52,575
your favorite characters and engage in epic battles.

127
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:55,777
So it's no different than sitting down with the toys

128
00:06:55,838 --> 00:06:57,539
and saying, I wonder what would happen

129
00:06:57,719 --> 00:06:59,800
if Ray and Luke fought Count Dooku.

130
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:02,782
I tend to think of even weirder ones like Jawas,

131
00:07:03,242 --> 00:07:05,704
you know, Rota, Rancor, that feels pretty good.

132
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,001
Oh, there we go.

133
00:07:10,101 --> 00:07:10,721
So this is the game.

134
00:07:11,861 --> 00:07:13,442
These are some handy GIFs.

135
00:07:14,662 --> 00:07:16,163
As you recall from earlier, I described it

136
00:07:16,183 --> 00:07:18,524
as a mid-to-hardcore character collection game

137
00:07:18,544 --> 00:07:19,864
with RPG progression elements.

138
00:07:20,104 --> 00:07:21,565
I failed the five times fast on that.

139
00:07:22,605 --> 00:07:24,546
So you can think Final Fantasy-style combat

140
00:07:24,586 --> 00:07:27,447
with mix-and-match Star Wars squads across factions and eras.

141
00:07:28,087 --> 00:07:29,988
Those factions and eras are represented

142
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:31,729
on the characters as faction tags.

143
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:35,070
So if you're a Stormtrooper, you have an Empire tag.

144
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,711
If you're a Plo Koon, you have a Jedi tag.

145
00:07:38,251 --> 00:07:40,312
But this isn't important now, but it will be important later.

146
00:07:40,332 --> 00:07:42,173
But just sort of put that in the back of your mind.

147
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:48,136
So let's talk about the game as it stands today,

148
00:07:48,236 --> 00:07:50,297
or in today in sort of a broader sense.

149
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:54,459
When we originally launched the game, we had 60 characters.

150
00:07:54,739 --> 00:07:56,620
We had several saga maps.

151
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,282
We had asymmetrical PVP with rank swap.

152
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:01,403
And we had a mode called Galactic War,

153
00:08:01,423 --> 00:08:04,304
where we harvested PVP teams and served them up

154
00:08:04,344 --> 00:08:06,545
in sort of a PV style lineup.

155
00:08:08,386 --> 00:08:13,911
Now we have 170 characters. We have 40 ships. We've had 15 title updates.

156
00:08:14,792 --> 00:08:19,495
There's some argument amongst the team about what counts as a content update, but I think we've had about 150 of them.

157
00:08:20,176 --> 00:08:27,002
We release about every two weeks, and oftentimes in every two weeks it's a new character or it's a new event. It's definitely a new something.

158
00:08:28,282 --> 00:08:32,403
Some of the features we've released is we've released raids, we've released guilds, we've

159
00:08:32,443 --> 00:08:33,943
released territory battles.

160
00:08:33,983 --> 00:08:39,344
You can think play sets where you fight against a big environment using a bunch of characters.

161
00:08:39,765 --> 00:08:41,385
Territory wars, that's guild versus guild.

162
00:08:41,905 --> 00:08:45,686
And Grand Arena, which is player versus player leveraging a wide amount of the collection.

163
00:08:46,766 --> 00:08:51,967
So let's start to dig into these three pillars that we were talking about.

164
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:53,307
This thing won't click over.

165
00:08:57,062 --> 00:08:58,343
There we go.

166
00:08:59,144 --> 00:09:00,265
So we're about to get started.

167
00:09:00,285 --> 00:09:02,687
And you're going to actually hear me regularly say, OK,

168
00:09:02,707 --> 00:09:03,108
here we go.

169
00:09:03,308 --> 00:09:06,211
But before we get started, so we can get a counter of it.

170
00:09:07,392 --> 00:09:10,035
But before we do, let's talk about the retrospective nature

171
00:09:10,435 --> 00:09:11,937
of the pillars of a live service.

172
00:09:12,117 --> 00:09:15,140
And the pillars of a live service, as we understand them,

173
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,902
change as the game ages.

174
00:09:17,002 --> 00:09:17,102
So

175
00:09:18,623 --> 00:09:22,305
When we were three days out of launch, the pillars as we would have evaluated them would

176
00:09:22,325 --> 00:09:23,286
have been very different.

177
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:27,388
Characters that they happen, like it's just here, have them, please.

178
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:32,171
When we were three months out of launch, the pillars likely would be evaluated differently

179
00:09:32,211 --> 00:09:32,512
as well.

180
00:09:32,932 --> 00:09:38,495
How do we find, what is the value of having these characters and sort of thinking about

181
00:09:38,515 --> 00:09:39,096
it in those terms?

182
00:09:39,656 --> 00:09:45,119
So what we're about to talk about right now is the pillars of the live service as we understand

183
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:47,721
it right now, moving into our fourth year of service.

184
00:09:48,201 --> 00:09:54,384
So the three pillars, and this always feels like there should be like a dork column or something.

185
00:09:55,225 --> 00:09:59,767
We'll review each of them, but they basically boil down into an economy consideration,

186
00:10:00,227 --> 00:10:04,550
the inherent play incentive that comes from playing the game,

187
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:07,071
and a player sentiment consideration as well.

188
00:10:09,451 --> 00:10:12,172
So, the first pillar, the durable economy.

189
00:10:13,032 --> 00:10:14,553
To talk about what a durable economy is,

190
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:17,094
you have to talk about what is a consumable economy first.

191
00:10:17,694 --> 00:10:20,455
So a consumable economy is an economy where,

192
00:10:20,635 --> 00:10:22,036
and specifically speaking about characters,

193
00:10:22,096 --> 00:10:24,737
where you have characters that exist

194
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:26,577
and other characters can absorb them

195
00:10:26,617 --> 00:10:27,618
and become more powerful.

196
00:10:27,658 --> 00:10:30,059
So your roster is more ephemeral

197
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:32,500
or something that's a strategic resource to be leveraged,

198
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,620
sort of the way to think of it.

199
00:10:35,603 --> 00:10:40,407
You can also have other parts of a consumable economy, potions that give you power or speed

200
00:10:40,467 --> 00:10:41,448
ups, things like that.

201
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:46,193
And while it's nuanced, the key difference between a consumable economy and the durable

202
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:50,016
economy, and specifically our durable economy, is that the characters that you have in the

203
00:10:50,056 --> 00:10:52,058
game, they last in perpetuity.

204
00:10:52,338 --> 00:10:56,842
Everything you do to them is subject to the further perfection of that character.

205
00:10:58,044 --> 00:11:02,448
So now that said, there are things in the economy that aren't durable.

206
00:11:02,488 --> 00:11:05,851
For instance, like we have soft currencies, credits, experience points, etc.

207
00:11:05,891 --> 00:11:11,918
But at its core, the character is the most durable part of the economy and subsequently the economy itself.

208
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:18,244
So, you know, sort of restated, this is a durable economy, not a consumable economy.

209
00:11:18,604 --> 00:11:18,865
Duh.

210
00:11:20,492 --> 00:11:22,113
Okay, second pillar, incremental progress.

211
00:11:22,233 --> 00:11:25,857
With durable characters, we made a core systems decision

212
00:11:25,897 --> 00:11:28,919
to have RPG-like gear and ability progression systems.

213
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,802
Coupled with the durability of the character economy,

214
00:11:31,962 --> 00:11:34,464
this means that progress is slow and incremental.

215
00:11:34,504 --> 00:11:36,186
And you may say, oh, that sounds boring.

216
00:11:36,646 --> 00:11:41,310
But what we have found is that our players love that process

217
00:11:41,471 --> 00:11:42,812
of perfecting their characters.

218
00:11:42,872 --> 00:11:44,834
It's a key motivation and satisfaction.

219
00:11:45,574 --> 00:11:47,895
Furthermore, because of the incrementality,

220
00:11:48,235 --> 00:11:49,816
players oftentimes use words like,

221
00:11:49,936 --> 00:11:51,837
well my Darth Vader is gear eight,

222
00:11:52,197 --> 00:11:54,938
or my Hermit Yoda is maxed on their abilities.

223
00:11:55,658 --> 00:11:57,679
This sense of ownership over the process

224
00:11:57,859 --> 00:11:59,620
is incredibly powerful.

225
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,021
And what this means is that incremental progress

226
00:12:02,061 --> 00:12:03,882
is a key motivation and satisfaction.

227
00:12:05,676 --> 00:12:07,758
And the third pillar here is respect investments.

228
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:12,102
So when players start developing a language of their Darth Vader

229
00:12:12,563 --> 00:12:14,545
and as an outgrowth of the other two pillars,

230
00:12:14,805 --> 00:12:17,708
it becomes incredibly important to respect the time and effort

231
00:12:17,748 --> 00:12:19,810
that they put in advancing and crafting their characters.

232
00:12:20,445 --> 00:12:24,668
Changing a beloved ability or interaction can turn off players and make them not want

233
00:12:24,688 --> 00:12:25,428
to engage anymore.

234
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:31,272
That's why if we do have to change something, we do our best to be transparent and we try

235
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,353
to have a well-reasoned answer as to why.

236
00:12:33,894 --> 00:12:37,296
And oftentimes we try to do our best to make it as positive as possible.

237
00:12:37,496 --> 00:12:38,316
We aren't perfect.

238
00:12:38,336 --> 00:12:41,398
I don't think that any game team can tackle this problem perfectly.

239
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:44,800
There's more on this later where I'm going to say some more mea culpas about it.

240
00:12:45,701 --> 00:12:47,742
But ultimately, rampant nerfing equals bad.

241
00:12:49,577 --> 00:12:54,921
OK, so based on the above, at the game's core, the atomic unit of value, and this is really

242
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:59,906
important, it's like the single building block, the atomic unit of value and fun in the game

243
00:13:00,286 --> 00:13:01,127
is the character.

244
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:08,873
All considerations of time, effort, substitution, demand, is driven by characters, and characters

245
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:11,576
relative to one another, their power synergistically, et cetera.

246
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,963
So let's dive into what are the three problems that arrive from these decisions that we've

247
00:13:17,983 --> 00:13:18,183
made.

248
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:19,544
If it will click.

249
00:13:20,465 --> 00:13:21,006
Will it click?

250
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:23,608
Okay.

251
00:13:24,308 --> 00:13:24,969
Talking about events.

252
00:13:25,409 --> 00:13:25,729
Not yet.

253
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:30,593
But what we're going to talk about now are the three problems that come from it.

254
00:13:30,753 --> 00:13:32,615
And the first of these is power creep.

255
00:13:33,376 --> 00:13:37,219
You can see here this is Supreme Leader Snoke's capital ship, the Supremacy.

256
00:13:37,979 --> 00:13:38,640
It's very big.

257
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,280
Very big.

258
00:13:40,607 --> 00:13:44,530
And it's so big, it dwarfs all other Star Destroyers that ever existed, right?

259
00:13:45,131 --> 00:13:47,993
It's like Death Star 1, Death Star 2, Starkiller Base.

260
00:13:48,013 --> 00:13:50,776
And that's fine, like, you know, things get bigger and they destroy more stuff.

261
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:51,376
Very scary.

262
00:13:51,876 --> 00:13:55,619
But I think it's actually a really good analogy for games, you know.

263
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:00,724
So with a game that has such a focus on characters, power creep is necessarily going to occur.

264
00:14:01,344 --> 00:14:06,309
You launch a game with 60 characters, you have strong base combat and a good litany of buffs and debuffs,

265
00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:11,694
and over time though, you can't just keep recycling the same abilities and buffs.

266
00:14:12,455 --> 00:14:17,920
You have to add something to enhance notability rotations or even just throw in things just to flip it on its head.

267
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:25,167
Managing that meta, that larger play experience of how all these characters interact together is critical.

268
00:14:25,647 --> 00:14:30,750
But that also means that you necessarily have to keep making it more interesting, and in

269
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,512
keeping it more interesting, if you have a bunch of characters that are durable, how

270
00:14:34,532 --> 00:14:35,752
do you keep them all relevant?

271
00:14:36,093 --> 00:14:37,413
Can you keep them all relevant?

272
00:14:39,014 --> 00:14:40,935
So let's talk about too many toys, second problem.

273
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:45,981
As you add more characters into a game, you need more and more ways to engage with the

274
00:14:46,021 --> 00:14:46,861
entire collection.

275
00:14:46,881 --> 00:14:48,223
Let's look at Darth Vader here.

276
00:14:48,783 --> 00:14:49,664
He's looking pretty boss.

277
00:14:49,844 --> 00:14:56,811
He's got his stormtroopers, and that's a pretty compelling fantasy there.

278
00:14:56,831 --> 00:15:01,375
I think all people, whether you're light side or dark side, have thought about this sort

279
00:15:01,415 --> 00:15:01,935
of thing.

280
00:15:01,996 --> 00:15:03,117
I'm leading him into battle.

281
00:15:03,157 --> 00:15:03,797
It's super cool.

282
00:15:04,645 --> 00:15:08,029
So how do you keep a player interested or organized around having stormtroopers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5?

283
00:15:09,851 --> 00:15:12,033
How do you keep them around wanting 5 and 6 and 7?

284
00:15:12,554 --> 00:15:17,699
And now layer in all the other troopers. You've got shore trooper, you've got death trooper, you've got snow trooper, you've got range trooper.

285
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,782
And there are more, believe me.

286
00:15:20,282 --> 00:15:24,387
And then you also have General Veers, who's very good with stormtroopers. Great leader, dies in an AT-AT.

287
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,434
Now, later on, you have to collect all these toys,

288
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:30,957
but then you also have to be able to show them all off.

289
00:15:31,578 --> 00:15:35,403
So with 170 characters, this is a real problem for us.

290
00:15:36,084 --> 00:15:39,189
How do you get players to engage with the toys

291
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:41,352
and not let them collect dust on the shelf?

292
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:45,631
And our third problem is preventing nerves.

293
00:15:45,671 --> 00:15:47,794
Now, I just said respect investments,

294
00:15:47,854 --> 00:15:49,816
but we can respect them.

295
00:15:50,237 --> 00:15:52,579
But sometimes things go wrong, right?

296
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,903
In fact, if you are a player of the game,

297
00:15:55,943 --> 00:15:57,345
you will notice last week we announced

298
00:15:57,365 --> 00:15:59,567
we were making some changes to some beloved characters

299
00:15:59,607 --> 00:16:02,791
and their interactions, HK47 being most notable of them.

300
00:16:03,952 --> 00:16:06,412
Preventing nerfs is easier said than done.

301
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:09,053
Because of the expanding size of the roster,

302
00:16:09,273 --> 00:16:11,813
the number of interactions between characters

303
00:16:11,853 --> 00:16:13,233
grows exponentially.

304
00:16:13,933 --> 00:16:15,854
And over time, there are plenty of things that either,

305
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:18,954
A, are interactions that we could never have accounted for

306
00:16:19,014 --> 00:16:20,394
no matter how much testing we do,

307
00:16:20,895 --> 00:16:22,875
or B, are abilities that made sense

308
00:16:22,895 --> 00:16:24,035
at the time of their release,

309
00:16:24,455 --> 00:16:26,155
but maybe deserve a second look,

310
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:27,296
or maybe don't make as much sense

311
00:16:27,336 --> 00:16:28,796
in the way the game has progressed.

312
00:16:29,896 --> 00:16:30,896
You know, going back to this idea

313
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,236
of the retrospective live service,

314
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,366
That's an important part of it, right?

315
00:16:34,447 --> 00:16:36,368
You may have made a decision in the past,

316
00:16:36,508 --> 00:16:38,871
but you have to be open and willing to sort of till it.

317
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,413
But in tilling it, you invite some snakes

318
00:16:41,493 --> 00:16:43,455
and some other scary things to maybe come after you.

319
00:16:44,035 --> 00:16:46,397
So the problem for us is, how do you prevent nerfs?

320
00:16:46,578 --> 00:16:48,159
Or if you do have to nerf,

321
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:50,201
how do you make it as positive as possible?

322
00:16:51,822 --> 00:16:54,405
Okay, so let's talk about three solutions.

323
00:16:55,486 --> 00:16:56,927
Not events yet, but soon.

324
00:17:00,321 --> 00:17:03,547
Solution number one for us is called managing diversity.

325
00:17:04,587 --> 00:17:05,987
So you have all these characters,

326
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,567
and they all do different things,

327
00:17:07,847 --> 00:17:09,768
and they've all been released at various parts

328
00:17:09,808 --> 00:17:12,628
of the game's lifecycle, meaning some characters are newer

329
00:17:12,808 --> 00:17:16,109
and perhaps more powerful, and some characters are older

330
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:17,869
and perhaps less powerful.

331
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:21,230
So you could just let the characters exist where they are,

332
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,591
with many of them being edged out over time.

333
00:17:24,131 --> 00:17:26,651
And at this point, you're considering a practical roster

334
00:17:27,011 --> 00:17:29,232
versus an actual one, or stated another way,

335
00:17:29,552 --> 00:17:31,412
how many characters are actually used

336
00:17:31,492 --> 00:17:33,553
versus how many actually exist.

337
00:17:34,644 --> 00:17:38,006
And if you think back to our problem statements, this fits under, like, all the headings.

338
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:41,568
Too many toys, power creep, and in some ways preventing nerves.

339
00:17:42,489 --> 00:17:51,013
So if you instead recontextualize designing characters and as an ecosystem, you can instead

340
00:17:51,053 --> 00:17:56,076
think of them as animals filling very specific ecological niches, instead of all of them

341
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,418
being apex predators at the time that they exist, right?

342
00:17:59,118 --> 00:18:02,739
Or in some instances, one apex predator that everything else is fodder.

343
00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:07,901
So similar to our pond up there, we think it becomes a more interesting problem and

344
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:13,903
one with some interesting gameplay impacts for how you design and develop inside of it.

345
00:18:14,263 --> 00:18:18,525
Now the character discussion becomes, when you think about it as an ecosystem, which

346
00:18:18,605 --> 00:18:20,986
characters beat which other characters in PvP?

347
00:18:21,626 --> 00:18:24,147
Which characters are useful in one mode or another?

348
00:18:25,008 --> 00:18:28,240
What places can we create that these characters shine

349
00:18:28,962 --> 00:18:31,090
and that you feel good for using them regularly?

350
00:18:32,303 --> 00:18:34,864
And if some characters have been edged out by Power Creep,

351
00:18:35,324 --> 00:18:37,685
then maybe we can target them for an update

352
00:18:38,126 --> 00:18:39,346
and flip the ecosystem.

353
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:41,767
Like literally say, oh, Shore Trooper, Death Trooper,

354
00:18:41,807 --> 00:18:43,989
they just need Range Trooper, and they'll be much better.

355
00:18:45,109 --> 00:18:47,530
And all the while, we're still introducing new creatures

356
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:48,511
into the system.

357
00:18:48,631 --> 00:18:50,492
So it's constantly evolving and changing,

358
00:18:50,512 --> 00:18:52,453
which for a live operation, I think

359
00:18:52,493 --> 00:18:54,894
is actually, that's really the most exciting part, right?

360
00:18:54,974 --> 00:18:57,795
That the game is not static, that it changes all the time.

361
00:18:58,797 --> 00:19:06,360
So as such, we've even gone so far as to use biodiversity measurements and statistics to

362
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,883
analyze our game and to think about all the different characters and the ways in which

363
00:19:10,923 --> 00:19:12,483
players use them and where they use them.

364
00:19:13,004 --> 00:19:18,446
So we seek to manage the diversity of the system rather than consider it from one local

365
00:19:18,566 --> 00:19:21,148
optimum to the next, one character to the next.

366
00:19:22,507 --> 00:19:25,950
This manifest is creating events that are unique to certain characters,

367
00:19:26,211 --> 00:19:28,253
areas of the game where some characters perform best,

368
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:32,658
reworking old characters, and introducing new characters that revitalize old groups.

369
00:19:34,838 --> 00:19:36,559
Back to this idea of nesting utility.

370
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:38,220
So we're back.

371
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,400
Star Wars stuff.

372
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,962
When we sit down to release a character, we oftentimes work backwards from the place where

373
00:19:44,982 --> 00:19:50,183
we release a high affinity game changing character and think about all the other stuff that has

374
00:19:50,203 --> 00:19:50,844
to go along with it.

375
00:19:50,964 --> 00:19:54,605
And so the example I oftentimes use here is Commander Luke Skywalker.

376
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,946
You know him as Luke with lightsaber and beige fatigues.

377
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,246
But Empire Strikes Back Luke.

378
00:20:00,687 --> 00:20:02,008
So we looked at ourselves and we said,

379
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:04,509
it'd be super cool to put this Luke into the game.

380
00:20:04,889 --> 00:20:06,230
But what do we think players want to do?

381
00:20:06,631 --> 00:20:08,992
Well, they probably want to put Luke with his friends.

382
00:20:09,132 --> 00:20:11,154
Princess Leia, Han Solo.

383
00:20:11,714 --> 00:20:13,535
Okay, so those characters, they're old.

384
00:20:13,555 --> 00:20:14,796
We're going to have to do some work around them

385
00:20:14,816 --> 00:20:16,097
to make sure that that's fun, right?

386
00:20:16,557 --> 00:20:17,258
Oh, but wait a second.

387
00:20:17,498 --> 00:20:19,159
Luke is missing his best buddy, R2-D2.

388
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:24,352
OK, well let's make a kit for R2-D2, and let's put him in the game, and he's going to do well with Luke.

389
00:20:24,372 --> 00:20:26,893
But wait a second. R2's a big deal, right?

390
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:31,475
Like, you can't just release R2-D2, and you have to create some sort of aspiration.

391
00:20:31,836 --> 00:20:36,838
Having R2 is a mark of honor, a badge, you know, that you've done something great in the game.

392
00:20:36,938 --> 00:20:40,620
OK, well, so who's looking for R2? The Empire.

393
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,301
OK, we've got these faction tags we talked about earlier.

394
00:20:44,387 --> 00:20:49,270
So now, okay, so you need, the Empire is looking for R2-D2 for the plans for the Death Star.

395
00:20:49,951 --> 00:20:53,033
Let's make Empire characters get R2-D2.

396
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:55,074
Okay, well let's go look at the Empire characters.

397
00:20:55,415 --> 00:20:57,596
Okay, they're old and not so great too.

398
00:20:57,796 --> 00:21:01,619
Not the Empire itself, but our abilities, our old school abilities for them aren't as

399
00:21:01,639 --> 00:21:02,460
good as they used to be.

400
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,962
Okay, so now we need to rework the Empire as well.

401
00:21:06,883 --> 00:21:07,644
So now it goes.

402
00:21:08,794 --> 00:21:15,723
Empire characters need to be reworked, and then we release R2D2, and then you get R2D2,

403
00:21:16,003 --> 00:21:19,648
and then Luke's friends get reworked, and then we ask for you to have all of them to

404
00:21:19,688 --> 00:21:20,088
get Luke.

405
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:22,399
That sounds like a content roadmap.

406
00:21:22,479 --> 00:21:24,680
That sounds like a way in which we can release characters

407
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,640
to light up the entire amount of people's rosters

408
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,061
and collections as they go through.

409
00:21:30,741 --> 00:21:32,141
And that actually was what we did.

410
00:21:32,201 --> 00:21:34,501
That is one of our very successful ones.

411
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:37,022
But it's also, in many ways, it's the spine.

412
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:39,202
It's the spine of a content roadmap, right?

413
00:21:39,822 --> 00:21:42,043
Players can sense and see it once you

414
00:21:42,063 --> 00:21:43,043
start showing it to them.

415
00:21:43,163 --> 00:21:45,383
Hey, they've got bigger plans here.

416
00:21:45,423 --> 00:21:47,084
And the things that I'm doing now

417
00:21:47,684 --> 00:21:49,744
roll up into things that are going to happen later.

418
00:21:50,204 --> 00:21:52,187
And by being able to show that time and time again,

419
00:21:52,207 --> 00:21:56,071
they stick around to see what that experience looks like.

420
00:21:56,752 --> 00:21:58,955
So in many ways, we think of that

421
00:21:59,155 --> 00:22:00,577
as it's a year's worth of content,

422
00:22:00,857 --> 00:22:02,739
and we've created an interesting game story

423
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,901
as players follow along.

424
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:09,005
Okay, so let's talk about solution number three, authenticity.

425
00:22:09,185 --> 00:22:12,248
And I'm going to go ahead and preface that I'm lucky to work on a Star Wars game

426
00:22:12,268 --> 00:22:16,232
and not everybody has the IP of Star Wars, but I do think the result here,

427
00:22:16,272 --> 00:22:18,294
and especially if you just watched the Candy Crush talk,

428
00:22:18,675 --> 00:22:22,679
I think it shows that it generalizes, that the IP, that story that's told is important.

429
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,683
We exist in what we think of as an enviable state.

430
00:22:25,983 --> 00:22:27,986
Star Wars, as we talked about earlier with the toys,

431
00:22:28,106 --> 00:22:30,089
is a story that is very well understood.

432
00:22:30,689 --> 00:22:32,672
And in many ways, we get to leverage our audience's

433
00:22:32,772 --> 00:22:34,535
nostalgia for characters that they love

434
00:22:34,755 --> 00:22:36,898
to serve them the content that we believe they will love.

435
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,402
All of the characters in Star Wars have relationships between one another, so we get ready-made

436
00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:43,202
play interaction.

437
00:22:43,402 --> 00:22:48,324
So from row one, Chirrut and Baze, they're best friends, they're life-bonded.

438
00:22:49,084 --> 00:22:51,365
Their character abilities actually reference one another.

439
00:22:51,465 --> 00:22:53,386
If Chirrut is present, if Baze is present.

440
00:22:53,746 --> 00:22:58,207
Back to that idea of the troopers from Empire Strikes Back, we have General Veers, a commander

441
00:22:58,247 --> 00:23:01,148
of Imperial Trooper who provides powerful synergies for all troopers.

442
00:23:02,772 --> 00:23:07,996
This boils down to abilities that reference other characters, characters having factions

443
00:23:08,016 --> 00:23:10,357
they are a part of, with game relevant outcomes.

444
00:23:11,097 --> 00:23:14,840
We aren't telling any new stories in Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes.

445
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,502
What we are doing, though, is remembering them, which we think the fans really like.

446
00:23:19,563 --> 00:23:19,703
Okay.

447
00:23:19,723 --> 00:23:25,567
A lot of talk about characters, but I hope that you can understand that this is the

448
00:23:26,937 --> 00:23:30,339
You know, it goes back to that idea of the character is the atomic unit of value, right,

449
00:23:30,479 --> 00:23:30,859
and fun.

450
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:35,140
And that you really can't have a conversation about how you do anything else in the game

451
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,162
without first considering the way that characters fit into it.

452
00:23:39,022 --> 00:23:42,944
I've been describing how we use events to release characters, how characters, you need

453
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:45,064
other characters to gain access into events.

454
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:50,186
The character is ultimately, serves the value and the fun of the game.

455
00:23:50,667 --> 00:23:53,274
And so you have, for us, you can talk about the events

456
00:23:53,334 --> 00:23:54,177
and what all we do with them,

457
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:55,862
but you first have to talk about characters.

458
00:23:55,882 --> 00:23:57,165
You have to be very mindful of that.

459
00:23:57,879 --> 00:24:05,724
Okay. So one more before we get started. One more. I want to make just a technical note,

460
00:24:05,785 --> 00:24:10,468
but it's one that should be made, in that we think of our live events portfolio as covering

461
00:24:10,528 --> 00:24:16,112
both our feature events, quotations, things that require significant engineering, and

462
00:24:16,152 --> 00:24:19,615
our regular events. And those are ones where the system is well understood, the designers

463
00:24:19,655 --> 00:24:23,638
can easily implement inside of it, they can just hop in and do some XML and attach assets

464
00:24:23,678 --> 00:24:23,778
to.

465
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:31,341
The reason we think of both of them as a part of the live events portfolio is because the daily excitement of having different experiences

466
00:24:31,981 --> 00:24:38,543
turn on and off is something that has to be managed and can be optimized to provide what is hopefully the ideal player experience.

467
00:24:39,203 --> 00:24:44,825
So as we talk about our mechanics and our event design, bear in mind I'm talking about both large and small scale events

468
00:24:45,685 --> 00:24:48,066
and that they are relatively equal in our mind.

469
00:24:48,626 --> 00:24:51,807
All part of the day-to-day mix of experiences in Galaxy of Heroes.

470
00:24:53,324 --> 00:24:59,315
Okay, so you can draw a pretty straight line between managing utility and managing diversity here.

471
00:25:01,218 --> 00:25:03,439
What we mean by that is that I said,

472
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:05,942
let's create a niche in the ecosystem, right?

473
00:25:05,982 --> 00:25:08,844
Well, events are a very easy way for us to do that.

474
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,325
You can think of the pond as a metaphor

475
00:25:10,365 --> 00:25:11,206
for a bunch of events,

476
00:25:11,766 --> 00:25:13,188
and that different characters fit into that

477
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:14,189
where they are very good,

478
00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:15,790
or not so good in some other places.

479
00:25:16,531 --> 00:25:18,732
So we regularly use our events to create a home

480
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:20,114
for languishing characters,

481
00:25:20,354 --> 00:25:21,275
upcoming characters,

482
00:25:21,435 --> 00:25:23,236
or characters we don't even know about yet.

483
00:25:23,496 --> 00:25:24,357
I mean, we know about them,

484
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:25,558
but they don't exist yet.

485
00:25:26,895 --> 00:25:30,798
So up there to the far left and on the far right you can see the Rancor and the AAT,

486
00:25:30,878 --> 00:25:31,698
those are two raids.

487
00:25:32,139 --> 00:25:35,762
And the middle one is for our playset battle, the Battle of Hoth.

488
00:25:37,866 --> 00:25:40,368
The Battle of Hoth requires rebels and empire characters.

489
00:25:40,448 --> 00:25:46,992
And the Rancor and A.T., the raids, early on there was a really novel Ewok Jedi squad

490
00:25:47,032 --> 00:25:51,574
that could best the Rancor, whereas before the Jedi and Ewoks weren't doing so great.

491
00:25:51,995 --> 00:25:56,197
So the mechanics of designing events to manage utility is twofold.

492
00:25:56,698 --> 00:26:00,960
It can give us a direction on how we design and re-wear characters, such as let's make

493
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,501
this character good for a raid.

494
00:26:03,122 --> 00:26:08,045
It can also be a place to show off the vast roster of characters that exist with requirements.

495
00:26:10,127 --> 00:26:16,431
Next second mechanic is faction gating, which I actually described perfectly earlier with

496
00:26:16,511 --> 00:26:22,635
R2D2, but more broadly stated or defined, nesting utility is using specific groups of

497
00:26:22,696 --> 00:26:24,317
characters to get something in game.

498
00:26:24,637 --> 00:26:27,159
Credits, mods, other characters, et cetera.

499
00:26:28,012 --> 00:26:29,653
So R2D2 gets you Luke.

500
00:26:29,673 --> 00:26:31,493
You can see there in the middle there's Chewbacca.

501
00:26:31,653 --> 00:26:33,594
Chewbacca is always being chased by bounty hunters.

502
00:26:33,914 --> 00:26:35,835
Take some bounty hunters, get some Chewbacca.

503
00:26:37,235 --> 00:26:39,076
But we use faction gating even outside

504
00:26:39,176 --> 00:26:41,136
of just unlocking characters.

505
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:42,577
Scoundrels steal credits.

506
00:26:42,697 --> 00:26:43,917
The Empire fights Ewoks.

507
00:26:44,337 --> 00:26:45,338
The Jedi fight Sith.

508
00:26:45,978 --> 00:26:47,578
And those all yield rewards as well.

509
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:52,430
So, in doing so, we can light up different parts of the player's collection regularly

510
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:55,594
and make their toys feel special in the context they are being used.

511
00:26:56,115 --> 00:27:00,362
And in using an event structure, we believe we can keep the experience novel by requiring

512
00:27:00,402 --> 00:27:01,844
different things on different days.

513
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:05,227
And finally, let's talk about telling a story.

514
00:27:05,247 --> 00:27:09,128
I want to reiterate that we do not tell any new stories in Galaxy of Heroes.

515
00:27:09,448 --> 00:27:11,469
But we do lean into the stories that have been told.

516
00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:16,010
So wherever we can, we use our events to make nods to the stories that have been told, and

517
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:19,832
in some instances, create retellings of stories with the characters that exist in the game.

518
00:27:20,552 --> 00:27:22,973
Above you can see the panel art from our journey event type.

519
00:27:23,593 --> 00:27:26,555
That's Jedi Knight Revan, that's Rey, and that's Luke Skywalker.

520
00:27:26,915 --> 00:27:28,837
We just announced Darth Revan, who's coming soon.

521
00:27:29,597 --> 00:27:33,100
The details of the requirements of this event type isn't really that important.

522
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,342
What's more important is that we acknowledge that there is a broader universe,

523
00:27:36,923 --> 00:27:40,826
and that universe is something our players want to engage with as often as they can,

524
00:27:40,846 --> 00:27:42,106
and as deeply as they can.

525
00:27:43,153 --> 00:27:47,955
So ultimately, our game enables fans to experience the full breadth and depth of the Star Wars

526
00:27:48,015 --> 00:27:50,176
universe through holotable set in a cantina.

527
00:27:50,876 --> 00:27:54,177
We never tell the players where they are or when they are, so we can always bring new

528
00:27:54,218 --> 00:27:57,239
Star Wars content into the game without messing with the narrative timelines.

529
00:27:57,939 --> 00:28:01,300
And this is where I had some really sweet transitions that all broke.

530
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,361
So we're going to pause for a second.

531
00:28:03,661 --> 00:28:05,682
Yes, that's Ronald Reagan riding a velociraptor.

532
00:28:34,028 --> 00:28:52,662
Statement. This should be fun.

533
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:56,825
Observation. Now that is the master I remember.

534
00:29:00,944 --> 00:29:02,410
That's a trailer for our latest event,

535
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,718
and you can see even just across all of the language,

536
00:29:04,758 --> 00:29:06,826
it's about remember, relive.

537
00:29:08,027 --> 00:29:09,668
Remember the story that was told.

538
00:29:10,068 --> 00:29:12,569
So we embrace that wholeheartedly,

539
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:14,409
and it's a really important part of the way

540
00:29:14,429 --> 00:29:15,169
that we make the game.

541
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:20,031
So what I want to do now is, of course, go to the,

542
00:29:22,112 --> 00:29:24,892
cool, this is neat.

543
00:29:24,912 --> 00:29:26,373
I am not taking questions right now,

544
00:29:26,393 --> 00:29:27,673
but I will catch you guys in the lounge.

545
00:29:27,693 --> 00:29:29,154
But I do want to make sure, since I've

546
00:29:29,214 --> 00:29:32,475
used up all the time available, that I leave my email address.

547
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:35,756
And if you have any questions, feel free to email me at.

548
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:39,544
My email address that ended terribly.

549
00:29:39,564 --> 00:29:41,228
I besmirched the good name of my people.

550
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,494
Thank you everybody for your patience and everything else.
