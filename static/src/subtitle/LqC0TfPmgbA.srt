00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:19,154
Hello and welcome to my presentation about how a time loop influenced Deathloop's narrative

2
00:00:19,195 --> 00:00:19,555
design.

3
00:00:21,036 --> 00:00:26,640
Before we begin, be aware that there are some pretty massive, unavoidable story spoilers

4
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,100
for the game.

5
00:00:29,334 --> 00:00:30,175
So you have been warned.

6
00:00:30,535 --> 00:00:33,015
And my name is, as you heard, Paweł Krajenka.

7
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:37,196
And I used to do some translation and interpreting,

8
00:00:37,877 --> 00:00:40,017
and then I switched to game development in 2013,

9
00:00:40,057 --> 00:00:43,338
and I started out as a game designer.

10
00:00:43,358 --> 00:00:46,699
I did a little production, and then I specialized in narrative.

11
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,420
And I am currently lead narrative designer at Arcane.io.

12
00:00:50,247 --> 00:00:53,451
And some of the games I worked on include Heart West,

13
00:00:54,032 --> 00:00:57,435
which is a turn-based tactical, Phantom Doctrine,

14
00:00:57,636 --> 00:00:59,998
which is the same genre but a different setting,

15
00:01:00,779 --> 00:01:02,241
and most recently Deathloop,

16
00:01:02,661 --> 00:01:05,064
which we're gonna cover in more detail today.

17
00:01:06,245 --> 00:01:11,629
So Deathloop is a next-gen first-person shooter from Mark and Neil, and in Deathloop there are

18
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:18,273
two rival assassins who are trapped in a mysterious time loop on the island of Blackreef and are doomed

19
00:01:18,293 --> 00:01:20,295
to repeat the same day for eternity.

20
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:23,902
You play as Colt, a soldier without memory,

21
00:01:24,442 --> 00:01:27,885
who can only break the cycle by killing eight key targets

22
00:01:27,925 --> 00:01:28,866
before the day ends.

23
00:01:30,047 --> 00:01:31,548
And you need to learn from each cycle,

24
00:01:31,588 --> 00:01:34,491
try new paths, gather intel, find new weapons and abilities,

25
00:01:35,031 --> 00:01:37,093
and do whatever it takes to break the loop.

26
00:01:37,876 --> 00:01:43,984
But beware, Juliana, who is the other assassin, is out on the prowl and she's doing her best to stop you.

27
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:46,688
And she can be another player.

28
00:01:47,248 --> 00:01:50,152
So if at first you don't succeed, die and die again.

29
00:01:50,172 --> 00:01:54,698
This is more or less the back of the box description of the game.

30
00:01:56,619 --> 00:02:00,082
And here's how it looked a little bit more under the hood.

31
00:02:00,123 --> 00:02:03,746
So we have four distinct areas on the island.

32
00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:07,851
There's Abdam, there's Carls Bay, the complex, and Fristad Rock.

33
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:12,496
And you can visit those areas, each of those areas, four times during...

34
00:02:13,697 --> 00:02:19,065
during one of the four times of the day. So there's morning, noon, the afternoon, and the evening.

35
00:02:19,846 --> 00:02:27,397
So basically, if you multiply areas by the times of day, you get up the morning, which is the area

36
00:02:27,457 --> 00:02:28,058
of up them.

37
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:35,461
in the morning and it has some quests and some content. Then there's up down noon, which is

38
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:39,801
more or less the same area. The layout looks similar, but there are some new paths that open

39
00:02:39,881 --> 00:02:45,903
up or close in this time period. And there's new content completely different from the morning.

40
00:02:46,143 --> 00:02:51,024
And the same is true for the afternoon. So you get a third set of content on the vaguely the

41
00:02:51,064 --> 00:02:56,465
same layout, but still there are some changes that apply. And in the evening again, the content is

42
00:02:56,505 --> 00:02:56,805
different.

43
00:02:58,626 --> 00:03:01,626
is the same area, but it evolves over time.

44
00:03:02,107 --> 00:03:05,928
And the same is true for Crawl's Bay and for the remaining two areas.

45
00:03:06,488 --> 00:03:09,409
And if you want to be really nitpicky in the game,

46
00:03:09,429 --> 00:03:12,490
those two periods that just disappeared are not actually available.

47
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,731
And if you want to learn more about this,

48
00:03:15,771 --> 00:03:18,131
you may have seen the presentation of my colleague,

49
00:03:18,151 --> 00:03:24,673
Sébastien Mégane-Agné, who talked about the level design of those areas and over time.

50
00:03:25,952 --> 00:03:30,894
And if you haven't seen them, maybe you will be able to see it in replay or on the vault.

51
00:03:31,854 --> 00:03:36,356
So in terms of narrative structure, we first start with the prologue mission,

52
00:03:36,396 --> 00:03:39,898
which is on a special map. And this is basically the tutorial where we introduce

53
00:03:40,818 --> 00:03:42,799
stuff like, you know, movement and

54
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:47,341
the main characters and the main conflict.

55
00:03:48,182 --> 00:03:50,544
And then we proceed into the guided tour,

56
00:03:50,784 --> 00:03:54,928
which happens on those main core maps

57
00:03:55,108 --> 00:03:56,029
that I've mentioned before.

58
00:03:56,089 --> 00:03:57,850
So Abdaam and the rest of those areas,

59
00:03:58,351 --> 00:04:00,372
but they're arranged in a linear fashion.

60
00:04:00,412 --> 00:04:04,656
We are forcing the player to go to a specific map

61
00:04:04,676 --> 00:04:05,777
at a specific time period.

62
00:04:05,877 --> 00:04:07,879
And we are using this progression to teach them

63
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,300
how the time loop works,

64
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,902
to introduce the main characters,

65
00:04:11,002 --> 00:04:11,562
to introduce...

66
00:04:12,646 --> 00:04:20,013
the main quest, so how do you break the loop, what is necessary to break it, and you may learn

67
00:04:20,253 --> 00:04:25,238
more about the guided tour and how it was conceived from the talk of Danganite

68
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:28,662
and all that happened on Monday, and you should be able to see it in replay.

69
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:36,119
by now. So at any rate, by the time you end the guided tour, two things can happen. You can either

70
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:43,322
die or if you survive, then you go to an evening mission. And after that, the loop is over and the

71
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:49,304
day starts over in the morning and the player, the game opens up. The player is now able to pick

72
00:04:49,604 --> 00:04:52,204
any of the four available maps from the morning period.

73
00:04:53,065 --> 00:04:59,727
So we as narrative designers have no idea what the player is going to pick beyond the end of the guided tour.

74
00:05:00,847 --> 00:05:05,488
And within any of those maps, there are a whole bunch of stuff that the player can do.

75
00:05:06,249 --> 00:05:13,371
So for instance, if one of the visionaries, so if one of those key targets is present in the map, the player might try to take them out.

76
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:19,473
Or they might go and do a side mission of some sort, which is not directly connected to any of those main targets.

77
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:25,097
and there are vignettes, which are just smaller pieces of content, and there are leads, which

78
00:05:25,177 --> 00:05:31,943
are effectively the leads that lead you to breaking the loop, your clues in that direction.

79
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:38,849
You can also go and explore freely, just play around with the systems and just don't engage

80
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:43,453
in anything specific. If you are invaded by another player, then you engage in multiplayer,

81
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:46,016
or you can just, as soon as you enter the map, you can leave.

82
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:49,650
and that will advance the time to the next time period.

83
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,052
So again, as narrative designers,

84
00:05:52,272 --> 00:05:53,974
we have no guarantee that the player

85
00:05:54,034 --> 00:05:55,255
is going to do any of this stuff

86
00:05:55,275 --> 00:05:57,057
because all of it is completely optional.

87
00:05:58,318 --> 00:05:59,799
And when you leave the map

88
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:01,961
and you advance into the noon period,

89
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:05,144
then again, you can pick from the available maps

90
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:08,768
or you could skip directly to the afternoon

91
00:06:08,848 --> 00:06:11,030
and pick one of the available maps in the afternoon.

92
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:16,260
Or if you skip to the evening, then you can pick one of the four maps in the evening,

93
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,005
or you can even skip over and start another loop iteration from the morning.

94
00:06:20,225 --> 00:06:24,751
So again, as narrative designers, we have no idea where the player is going to go.

95
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,374
And this level of choice...

96
00:06:28,295 --> 00:06:30,916
is available to the player on each loop iteration.

97
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:34,817
So if they do one, two, three, four, or more loops,

98
00:06:34,837 --> 00:06:37,477
however long it takes them to complete the game,

99
00:06:37,878 --> 00:06:40,058
each time they have the choice of those,

100
00:06:40,298 --> 00:06:42,679
all of those maps and time periods as they please.

101
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:44,659
They can skip time as they please, et cetera.

102
00:06:46,179 --> 00:06:50,080
So summarizing Deathloop is an FPS arcane style.

103
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,901
So it has a strong component of immersive sim DNA.

104
00:06:54,022 --> 00:06:56,302
It is not a roguelike or roguelite.

105
00:06:57,602 --> 00:06:59,283
And it has the central time loop mechanic,

106
00:06:59,343 --> 00:07:01,703
which influences basically everything in the game.

107
00:07:02,243 --> 00:07:03,664
And it's gloriously non-linear.

108
00:07:04,704 --> 00:07:08,285
So our big question as narrative designers

109
00:07:08,665 --> 00:07:11,265
was, how do we design the narrative of this game

110
00:07:12,006 --> 00:07:14,286
to support this core mechanic of a time loop,

111
00:07:14,946 --> 00:07:18,547
to support all of this player choice and reward it?

112
00:07:19,247 --> 00:07:22,348
And how do we tell a relevant story in those conditions?

113
00:07:24,747 --> 00:07:34,457
So there were a lot of things that we need to think about and we tried to narrow it down and ultimately we came up with a couple of basic design goals for this project.

114
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:42,125
And right now it looks very top-down, but this is not what it looked like when we were designing it.

115
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,619
you know, evolved organically.

116
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,740
So our main, our first design goal was that

117
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,401
players must feel that they are in the time loop,

118
00:07:51,641 --> 00:07:54,042
as opposed to a game where if you die, you respawn,

119
00:07:54,162 --> 00:07:56,163
or you, you know, load up an earlier save game

120
00:07:56,203 --> 00:07:56,723
or something like that.

121
00:07:56,883 --> 00:07:59,083
It needed to feel like a time loop story.

122
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:01,584
In other words, we need to pay off the core fantasy.

123
00:08:02,545 --> 00:08:05,646
So the player must feel that they are in a time loop

124
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:06,826
and they're looking for a way out of it.

125
00:08:08,227 --> 00:08:12,849
So in that, to achieve this, we tried to create a new normal for the player.

126
00:08:12,929 --> 00:08:14,830
We tried to make the time loop feel normal.

127
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,731
So the time loop is actually mentioned absolutely everywhere.

128
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:21,832
It's on graffiti, people talk about it, it's in advertisements,

129
00:08:22,513 --> 00:08:26,354
it's in virtually everywhere you go, there's a mention of the time loop.

130
00:08:26,374 --> 00:08:30,476
So obviously, the NPCs are aware of the existence of the time loop.

131
00:08:30,496 --> 00:08:31,536
They know that they're in it.

132
00:08:32,056 --> 00:08:34,757
They are just unaware how long it has been going.

133
00:08:36,284 --> 00:08:38,386
they still think it's the first day.

134
00:08:38,606 --> 00:08:39,868
And the next morning they wake up

135
00:08:39,908 --> 00:08:41,430
and they still think it's the first day.

136
00:08:43,212 --> 00:08:46,475
So unlike Groundhog Day, for instance,

137
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,178
where people are unaware that they're stuck

138
00:08:49,218 --> 00:08:51,881
in this repeating cycle,

139
00:08:53,823 --> 00:08:56,166
here, the NPCs are aware that they're in a time loop,

140
00:08:56,226 --> 00:08:58,028
but they don't know how long it's been going.

141
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:05,297
And so we are enforcing several ideas that are typical of a time loop story, and we are just

142
00:09:05,397 --> 00:09:11,383
executing them differently. So for instance, everything is replenished the next day. So

143
00:09:11,483 --> 00:09:16,327
there is no money, no possessions, because everything you take, everything you use,

144
00:09:16,527 --> 00:09:17,929
everything you destroy...

145
00:09:18,852 --> 00:09:22,373
is going to be there the next day, just unchanged, unharmed,

146
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:24,814
completely back to its original state.

147
00:09:25,734 --> 00:09:27,135
And this is also true for people.

148
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:30,816
So anybody who dies wakes up the next morning,

149
00:09:30,856 --> 00:09:31,836
and they're bright as rain.

150
00:09:32,437 --> 00:09:34,717
So that's why actually Colt, in order to break the loop,

151
00:09:34,737 --> 00:09:36,878
he needs to kill all of those visionaries

152
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:38,218
within a single day.

153
00:09:38,258 --> 00:09:40,459
Because if he only kills like three or four of them

154
00:09:40,499 --> 00:09:43,800
during a day, they will be revived the next morning.

155
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:48,081
So he needs to accomplish this task while the day is on.

156
00:09:49,518 --> 00:09:53,859
And so by doing those things in multiple places,

157
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,520
we are establishing the rules of the time loop.

158
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,080
And now that we have the rules,

159
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,561
we can stick to them to create a feeling of consistency

160
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:04,421
of the setting that, you know,

161
00:10:04,441 --> 00:10:05,862
there are rules of the time loop

162
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,422
and the world operates according to those rules.

163
00:10:08,502 --> 00:10:12,703
So any choices that the player does, makes during the day,

164
00:10:13,623 --> 00:10:17,664
they persist and then they are reset on the next morning.

165
00:10:18,687 --> 00:10:21,950
And it boosts intentionality.

166
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:25,753
So intentionality is something that is extremely important in an arcane game.

167
00:10:26,806 --> 00:10:29,248
because we want the player to be able to formulate a plan

168
00:10:29,348 --> 00:10:31,611
and then execute it based on the information that they have.

169
00:10:32,191 --> 00:10:33,993
And in a time loop, this works really well

170
00:10:34,073 --> 00:10:37,336
because you repeat the same environments all the time.

171
00:10:37,377 --> 00:10:40,340
You see the same things happen all the time in the same way.

172
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,963
So that gives you mastery over the environment.

173
00:10:43,983 --> 00:10:45,765
You can anticipate what's going to happen

174
00:10:45,805 --> 00:10:47,106
because you've already seen it.

175
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:50,150
Everybody else has done it before, but they don't remember.

176
00:10:51,925 --> 00:10:55,588
and actually made things cheaper in production overall

177
00:10:55,908 --> 00:11:00,551
because fewer speech variations and less reactivity

178
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,914
because even though you revisit the same location

179
00:11:04,974 --> 00:11:07,255
over and over again, those are always the same people

180
00:11:07,295 --> 00:11:08,636
and they always do the same thing.

181
00:11:08,716 --> 00:11:11,458
And it's important that they always do the same thing

182
00:11:11,718 --> 00:11:13,359
to maintain the solution of a time loop.

183
00:11:15,835 --> 00:11:22,522
So we actually needed to write fewer variations than we would have if, for instance, we were making a linear game,

184
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:29,568
you know, with a linear passage of time, and you would revisit a certain area and people would need to remember that you've been there already.

185
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:36,044
So our second goal was that players must progress despite the time loop.

186
00:11:36,545 --> 00:11:39,769
So we have this time loop that repeats infallibly each time,

187
00:11:40,249 --> 00:11:42,012
but we still, in this environment,

188
00:11:42,052 --> 00:11:44,655
we need to give the player a sense that they are progressing in the story.

189
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:53,213
And to us, the most important thing here was to have a unity of player and the player character in terms of their memory.

190
00:11:53,673 --> 00:12:00,675
So the player starts playing the game, they have never seen it before, so they start taking this world in,

191
00:12:01,196 --> 00:12:04,317
and so must the hero, they must be aligned at any point.

192
00:12:04,377 --> 00:12:06,498
Because if the hero knows more than the player does...

193
00:12:07,158 --> 00:12:10,360
then the player feels like they maybe did a bad job following the story,

194
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,721
and that creates a disconnect.

195
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:13,902
And we didn't want that, absolutely.

196
00:12:13,962 --> 00:12:17,084
So we need to make sure each time that the hero

197
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:19,345
knows exactly the same things as the player.

198
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:22,807
So the hero in our game is Amnesiac.

199
00:12:23,328 --> 00:12:24,208
He's an Amnesiac.

200
00:12:24,609 --> 00:12:24,789
And...

201
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:27,230
But that created a problem.

202
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:31,052
Why would our hero suddenly start remembering

203
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:32,633
now that you start playing him,

204
00:12:33,614 --> 00:12:35,455
although this loop has been going on for...

205
00:12:36,642 --> 00:12:37,503
God knows how long.

206
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:41,967
So we actually wrote it into the backstory of Cult, Our Hero,

207
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,571
a cycle of amnesia where he forgets everything,

208
00:12:46,671 --> 00:12:49,214
and then he goes back into a period

209
00:12:49,254 --> 00:12:50,575
where he starts remembering things.

210
00:12:51,196 --> 00:12:54,639
And this is where we introduced what

211
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,180
we call the pre-intro scene.

212
00:12:56,841 --> 00:12:58,322
And that's a scene where Juliana.

213
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,565
A picture here is murdering Colt with a machete.

214
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:04,608
And that is the very first thing that you see in the game.

215
00:13:04,788 --> 00:13:08,032
Then Colt wakes up on the beach, and maybe at first he

216
00:13:08,072 --> 00:13:09,813
thinks it was just a nightmare.

217
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:14,358
But then the woman contacts him, and he realizes that.

218
00:13:15,987 --> 00:13:16,808
it actually happens.

219
00:13:16,888 --> 00:13:19,189
So the player has seen that, the player now remembers it.

220
00:13:19,429 --> 00:13:20,929
And when Colt makes reference to this,

221
00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:23,670
then the player knows what Colt is talking about.

222
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,571
So they are united.

223
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,552
And the player does a lot of exploration, obviously,

224
00:13:27,592 --> 00:13:28,472
to learn about the world,

225
00:13:28,592 --> 00:13:30,173
but we needed a source of information

226
00:13:30,193 --> 00:13:32,234
that would bring them up to speed more rapidly.

227
00:13:32,894 --> 00:13:34,655
And this is also Juliana, actually,

228
00:13:35,075 --> 00:13:36,936
your nemesis, your antagonist.

229
00:13:37,618 --> 00:13:42,319
of the game. She's the guide and the sounding board. And that is all thanks to the fact

230
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:48,602
that she also has a persistent memory. She can remember from loop to loop. So we introduced

231
00:13:48,642 --> 00:13:55,444
a couple of characters who have this kind of persistent memory, but we found out that

232
00:13:55,784 --> 00:14:02,306
anybody who was not the hero or the antagonist creates actually a danger to the setting consistency.

233
00:14:04,245 --> 00:14:09,448
Because in most time loop stories, characters don't generally remember that they're in the time loop,

234
00:14:09,989 --> 00:14:13,711
unless they're the hero, and sometimes if they are the antagonist.

235
00:14:14,752 --> 00:14:20,936
Because when there is anybody else who remembers, that's an anomaly,

236
00:14:20,996 --> 00:14:24,419
and the audience starts looking for a pattern. And if they don't find anything,

237
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,624
it's confusing, like why doesn't anybody remember except this guy, even though he is not the hero.

238
00:14:33,885 --> 00:14:40,790
And that was confirmed by our user research team, where we found out after, you know, in the report

239
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:48,075
that people considered anybody who was not called or Juliana and who had persistent memory,

240
00:14:48,195 --> 00:14:53,479
that it was an anomaly, that there was something wrong, that the rules of the time were broken.

241
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:59,497
So our solution to this was to make a big reveal out of the fact that somebody remembers.

242
00:15:00,577 --> 00:15:04,898
So for instance, we have this semi-sentient computer called 2-bit in the game,

243
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:08,699
and this computer can remember from one loop iteration to another.

244
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:15,781
And before, that was just like a gameplay gimmick, you know, well, not gimmick, but like a gameplay mechanic.

245
00:15:15,821 --> 00:15:19,102
So you would revisit this area, and because this computer remembered the thing,

246
00:15:19,122 --> 00:15:22,103
he would change things around just to make life more difficult for you.

247
00:15:23,358 --> 00:15:27,879
And then it kind of became a part of the bigger story.

248
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:31,980
And we've decided to make a big reveal out of the fact

249
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:32,961
that Tubit can remember.

250
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,181
So when you first meet this computer,

251
00:15:35,221 --> 00:15:38,882
when you first talk to it, he makes it a big deal

252
00:15:38,922 --> 00:15:41,322
that, ooh, to tell you that he can remember.

253
00:15:41,362 --> 00:15:44,103
And this is made in a scene where

254
00:15:44,183 --> 00:15:47,504
we take all the control away from the player.

255
00:15:47,524 --> 00:15:49,364
And this is not something that we do lightly.

256
00:15:50,545 --> 00:15:51,165
at Arcane.

257
00:15:52,366 --> 00:15:54,988
So suddenly it becomes a big reveal

258
00:15:55,268 --> 00:15:57,250
that there's this important character called Tubit

259
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,791
who can remember from loop to loop.

260
00:15:59,352 --> 00:16:00,973
And because of making it a big deal,

261
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:02,314
it becomes part of the story.

262
00:16:02,334 --> 00:16:03,615
And the players are reassured

263
00:16:04,055 --> 00:16:05,897
that this is not just an omission on your part.

264
00:16:06,477 --> 00:16:07,798
And that kind of solved the trouble.

265
00:16:09,119 --> 00:16:13,322
There was also the question why Tubit remembers

266
00:16:13,383 --> 00:16:14,443
or anybody else remembers.

267
00:16:14,483 --> 00:16:16,345
So this is, we consider this part

268
00:16:16,405 --> 00:16:17,626
of the magic of the island.

269
00:16:19,705 --> 00:16:24,289
And we know within the dev team why people remember,

270
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:26,091
but we never explain it explicitly.

271
00:16:26,831 --> 00:16:28,933
In fact, in DevLoop, we leave a lot

272
00:16:28,953 --> 00:16:33,857
of hints that allow players to make

273
00:16:34,298 --> 00:16:35,359
some assumptions about that.

274
00:16:36,359 --> 00:16:38,501
But we ultimately left it entirely

275
00:16:38,521 --> 00:16:40,343
to players' imagination and interpretation.

276
00:16:41,611 --> 00:16:44,672
And of course, there were people who complained about that.

277
00:16:44,853 --> 00:16:47,594
They felt like we were, you know, just...

278
00:16:48,934 --> 00:16:50,835
We had no idea what we were maybe doing,

279
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,276
and we didn't want to explain that.

280
00:16:52,356 --> 00:16:55,678
But we actually didn't want to explain the magic,

281
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:57,819
because if you explain the magic,

282
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:00,720
it will not be as magical as people imagined it will be.

283
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,302
And we thought it would be better to just leave it to players.

284
00:17:07,595 --> 00:17:09,957
So, to summarize, we had two main design goals.

285
00:17:11,098 --> 00:17:12,619
The players must feel they're in a time loop,

286
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,560
and players must have a sense of progression.

287
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:19,024
And you will see that it informs everything else that we've done, more or less.

288
00:17:19,785 --> 00:17:20,745
So, for instance, themes.

289
00:17:22,287 --> 00:17:26,110
Somewhere over time, or in between time, or it's difficult to say,

290
00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:31,214
the goals that I just presented became aligned with the themes of our story.

291
00:17:31,954 --> 00:17:33,756
Or maybe it was the...

292
00:17:33,776 --> 00:17:34,677
Or anyway...

293
00:17:36,025 --> 00:17:38,965
Yeah, they kind of reflect one another.

294
00:17:39,005 --> 00:17:41,906
And you will see that it's true in a moment.

295
00:17:42,006 --> 00:17:46,127
Because, for instance, our theme number one is people are stuck in vicious cycles

296
00:17:46,707 --> 00:17:48,808
because they aren't mature enough to break out of them.

297
00:17:49,788 --> 00:17:51,728
And that's a big theme.

298
00:17:51,828 --> 00:17:54,709
It's a very relatable image if you have, I don't know, a bad habit

299
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:56,749
or you've maybe gone through a bad relationship

300
00:17:57,329 --> 00:17:59,930
or you had writer's block or anything like that.

301
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:03,731
You know that you can relate to an image of being stuck in a rut.

302
00:18:04,371 --> 00:18:06,713
and having difficulty getting out of it.

303
00:18:07,774 --> 00:18:09,955
So in Deathloop, this is presented literally

304
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:14,078
and figuratively as well, because the time loop itself

305
00:18:14,298 --> 00:18:17,360
is a very explicit illustration of a vicious cycle.

306
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,041
You are stuck on the island.

307
00:18:19,261 --> 00:18:21,023
The same day repeats over and over again.

308
00:18:21,163 --> 00:18:23,524
Everybody is trying to kill you.

309
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:28,808
That's a sick cycle, if I ever heard about one.

310
00:18:29,505 --> 00:18:31,908
And there's cold and Juliana and they have very flawed

311
00:18:31,928 --> 00:18:34,451
relationship where they're basically killing one another

312
00:18:34,611 --> 00:18:38,416
over and over again and they cannot seem to find a way out

313
00:18:38,456 --> 00:18:41,780
of it. And the same is true for the visionary. So the main

314
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,104
targets and the eternalists which are just the any all the

315
00:18:45,144 --> 00:18:47,727
other inhabitants of the island who are not visionaries or

316
00:18:47,807 --> 00:18:48,548
colder Juliana.

317
00:18:50,507 --> 00:18:54,489
And after a while, we realized that by illustrating this theme,

318
00:18:55,029 --> 00:18:57,750
we are getting awfully close to realizing also the goal number

319
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,111
one, which is the players must feel they are in a time loop.

320
00:19:00,251 --> 00:19:02,712
Because if we can show that you are in the time loop,

321
00:19:02,732 --> 00:19:05,714
then we are making this very explicit illustration

322
00:19:05,754 --> 00:19:10,156
of a vicious cycle being felt by the player and vice versa.

323
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:16,426
And so our second theme was that memory can be a treasure but also a curse.

324
00:19:16,806 --> 00:19:20,907
And this is basically an exploration of memory in a time loop.

325
00:19:21,287 --> 00:19:25,528
So some characters have persistent memory and how does that affect them?

326
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:29,609
How does living in a time loop affect their memory and their personality?

327
00:19:30,089 --> 00:19:32,530
And there are other characters who don't have persistent memory,

328
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,290
so how do they function in a time loop?

329
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:39,231
And Colt is in between those two worlds because sometimes he is

330
00:19:39,991 --> 00:19:41,211
facing the challenges of having...

331
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:46,494
persistent memory and sometimes he faces the challenges of not having persistent memory.

332
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:51,476
And that again connects to our second goal, which is to give players a sense of progression

333
00:19:51,996 --> 00:19:57,398
despite everything repeating. Because if you can remember what happens from loop to loop,

334
00:19:58,218 --> 00:20:04,541
then you have a chance of progressing in it. So basically the player's real life memory

335
00:20:04,901 --> 00:20:05,861
becomes Colt's memory.

336
00:20:07,463 --> 00:20:13,146
And we needed systems that would illustrate this divergence

337
00:20:13,186 --> 00:20:15,448
between people who can remember

338
00:20:15,468 --> 00:20:16,708
and people who cannot remember.

339
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:20,551
Because that creates opportunities for the player

340
00:20:20,571 --> 00:20:23,392
to exploit the lack of memory in the other characters

341
00:20:23,752 --> 00:20:26,294
to form a plan of getting out of the loop,

342
00:20:26,774 --> 00:20:28,355
manipulating the events that, you know.

343
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:34,968
in their service. And it also creates conflict. And as you know, conflict drives the story and

344
00:20:34,988 --> 00:20:37,453
the world and everything that you do in the narrative.

345
00:20:39,277 --> 00:20:46,042
So Deathloop is a game, in its most general sense, the story of Deathloop is about being stuck in a rut.

346
00:20:46,682 --> 00:20:52,506
And by the end of the game, Colt manages to break his own vicious cycle and therefore,

347
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:58,611
you know, the big loop. And by doing so, he gives everyone else on the island a chance

348
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:02,354
to re-evaluate their lives and do something with them.

349
00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:08,093
So let's talk about Colton and Juliana, who are our hero and antagonist.

350
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:12,837
And they're inextricably linked, not just because they have both persistent memory.

351
00:21:13,858 --> 00:21:17,581
They're also father and daughter, and they're best frenemies on the island.

352
00:21:17,741 --> 00:21:20,803
They kind of really like and really hate each other at the same time.

353
00:21:21,963 --> 00:21:26,628
And they are locked in this vicious cycle, because when Colt is trying to break the loop,

354
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:31,653
he starts remembering again. So he has this persistent memory. And that is very exciting

355
00:21:31,693 --> 00:21:38,561
for Giuliano because now he is, you know, in equal, they can like talk and have some sort of report.

356
00:21:39,979 --> 00:21:42,120
But Colt is really good at trying to break the loop.

357
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,221
So Juliana, and Juliana loves the loop.

358
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,662
She doesn't want it to be broken.

359
00:21:46,663 --> 00:21:48,904
So she needs to stop Colt from breaking the loop,

360
00:21:48,984 --> 00:21:51,226
but still keep him motivated to try to break it

361
00:21:51,566 --> 00:21:52,987
so he keeps being interested.

362
00:21:53,027 --> 00:21:56,189
Because if Colt, you know, quits, gives up,

363
00:21:56,229 --> 00:21:57,950
and doesn't want to break the loop anymore,

364
00:21:58,591 --> 00:22:00,652
he slides back into amnesia and becomes boring again.

365
00:22:00,672 --> 00:22:03,194
And then Juliana needs to murder him to kind of, you know,

366
00:22:03,394 --> 00:22:05,915
shake him up and make him want to break the loop again.

367
00:22:07,168 --> 00:22:12,031
So as a result, they really have no hope for a healthy family relationship.

368
00:22:13,251 --> 00:22:17,614
And Colt realizes that at some point and he decides that, okay, I need really need to break

369
00:22:17,654 --> 00:22:23,157
this loop, but this time I really need to break it. Because Colt has been doing this many, many

370
00:22:23,237 --> 00:22:28,320
times. He has arrived many times at a point where he was just an inch away from breaking the loop

371
00:22:29,001 --> 00:22:31,982
and he always failed for some reason. And we don't know why.

372
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,583
And the reason why is that he needs to kill all of the visionaries, and Juliana is one of them.

373
00:22:38,343 --> 00:22:42,986
And she stages it so that Colt needs to shoot her at point-blank range in the face,

374
00:22:43,747 --> 00:22:47,889
where she is basically defenseless. I mean, she also holds a gun, but she doesn't fire it.

375
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:57,816
So that is not an easy choice to make for the player, actually. And this is by design, because

376
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:03,911
we needed to illustrate why Colt has failed so many times

377
00:23:03,931 --> 00:23:04,591
to break the loop.

378
00:23:05,191 --> 00:23:08,432
And if we can make the player have qualms about shooting

379
00:23:08,472 --> 00:23:10,772
Juliane in the face, then it explains

380
00:23:10,812 --> 00:23:12,912
why Colt did not do it before.

381
00:23:14,133 --> 00:23:17,553
The player feels what all those Colts felt before.

382
00:23:17,853 --> 00:23:18,894
It's kind of meta.

383
00:23:19,994 --> 00:23:24,235
And why you would have trouble shooting her in the face,

384
00:23:25,073 --> 00:23:28,594
is because maybe you like Juliana. Juliana is a pretty cool character.

385
00:23:28,834 --> 00:23:32,115
And there's the trait of that. Breaking the loop will also break Juliana's heart.

386
00:23:32,135 --> 00:23:36,496
She makes it very clear. So actually, if you kill Juliana and break the loop,

387
00:23:38,497 --> 00:23:41,317
she will disappear from Colt's life. So again, they have no

388
00:23:41,737 --> 00:23:46,278
way of having a healthy relationship. But this is up to you to decide.

389
00:23:48,188 --> 00:23:51,531
And because you don't have to shoot, obviously, you can stay in the loop.

390
00:23:52,032 --> 00:23:56,216
And that was this choice that, you know, you will finish the game,

391
00:23:56,777 --> 00:24:00,460
you can only break the loop and finish the game by shooting Juliana in the face

392
00:24:02,162 --> 00:24:04,484
and at point-blank range was very controversial,

393
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:09,349
within and without of the narrative team. And that is understandable.

394
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:15,554
But because it was controversial, it made it clear that people really cared about it.

395
00:24:15,774 --> 00:24:21,036
And if there's one moment where I would like you to care about, you know, in Deathloop,

396
00:24:21,076 --> 00:24:21,656
it's this moment.

397
00:24:23,397 --> 00:24:29,179
So my takeaway here is that you always need to take into account what your team has to

398
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:29,379
say.

399
00:24:30,483 --> 00:24:40,267
and the reservations, etc. But sometimes it will not be maybe what you think is best for the story

400
00:24:40,287 --> 00:24:46,770
and you also need to listen to your story. So my reason for keeping this difficult moment in

401
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:53,673
is that shooting is the core action of this game. It's a shooter. You spend 20 plus hours

402
00:24:53,893 --> 00:24:55,774
shooting people. So

403
00:24:57,018 --> 00:25:00,963
ending the game with something else in a shot suggests that there is a third option,

404
00:25:01,203 --> 00:25:06,169
that you can do it, you can break the loop without harming everybody, without killing those people.

405
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,313
And that makes it a very different game, if it's the case.

406
00:25:10,154 --> 00:25:13,518
That will also be a very cool game, but it's not the game that we were making.

407
00:25:18,157 --> 00:25:22,038
you know, Colt has gone on the shooting spree to kill everybody,

408
00:25:22,218 --> 00:25:24,479
and you needed to kill all those visionaries,

409
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:27,259
not because Colt likes doing it, necessarily,

410
00:25:27,699 --> 00:25:29,100
but because it is the only way out.

411
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,200
And if it's the only way out, then it's the only way out until the end.

412
00:25:33,781 --> 00:25:37,802
And one important note is that actually very few players appreciate the ending of Deathloop.

413
00:25:38,802 --> 00:25:40,282
And if you look online, people say like,

414
00:25:40,302 --> 00:25:41,742
dude, this ending is garbage.

415
00:25:43,581 --> 00:25:47,831
but I think it's mostly due to, well, reading the comments.

416
00:25:49,555 --> 00:25:57,337
Yes, people had a hard time pulling the trigger facing Juliana, but what they were most disappointed

417
00:25:57,877 --> 00:26:03,399
with was that there is not enough payoff. So after you shoot Juliana and break the loop,

418
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:09,920
the game ends really quickly. There is very little of this, you know, the new wall. So you don't

419
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,501
really have the time to, I don't know, explore the island, talk to the people and see how they react

420
00:26:13,521 --> 00:26:14,362
to the breakage of the loop.

421
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:19,341
And my takeaway here would be to, if you make people make a difficult choice,

422
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:25,244
make sure that you are paying off that choice by taking your time to show the consequences.

423
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:34,069
Another group of characters are other cults. So while we're in production,

424
00:26:34,149 --> 00:26:35,690
we start asking ourselves the question,

425
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,921
Why did Colt fail to break the loop before?

426
00:26:39,522 --> 00:26:41,263
And why would he succeed this time?

427
00:26:42,103 --> 00:26:44,204
In other words, we realized that we needed

428
00:26:44,344 --> 00:26:45,905
a character arc for Colt.

429
00:26:46,626 --> 00:26:50,388
But the problem was that it's really difficult to execute

430
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:52,409
in a game like Deathloop because

431
00:26:55,751 --> 00:26:58,813
if Colt were supposed to go through changes

432
00:26:58,873 --> 00:27:03,415
and kind of start having a different opinion of things

433
00:27:04,135 --> 00:27:04,816
during the game.

434
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:11,339
we had no guarantee that the player would feel the same way as Colt and would evolve with Colt in the same direction.

435
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:17,220
So that would create a rift between the player and the character, which we didn't want.

436
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:23,121
So our solution to this was to give Colt a retroactive character arc, meaning that

437
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:29,723
Colt is already fully evolved as a character. He already has all the capacity to break the loop,

438
00:27:30,043 --> 00:27:33,163
but he just needs to realize it. He needs to remember that he has

439
00:27:33,723 --> 00:27:36,104
arrived at all those conclusions and that they are right.

440
00:27:37,404 --> 00:27:43,607
So as Colt discovers his past, he grows more confident about the views that he held of Blackreef,

441
00:27:43,687 --> 00:27:46,929
you know, and this whole thing that he needs to break the loop.

442
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,731
And we also needed a source of information that was not Juliana,

443
00:27:50,751 --> 00:27:52,632
because Juliana has too much of an agenda.

444
00:27:54,193 --> 00:27:56,774
It needed to be somebody who the player could trust unconditionally,

445
00:27:57,134 --> 00:28:03,218
so he could trust himself, right? That's where we have to visit Colt.

446
00:28:04,611 --> 00:28:09,917
So in the lore of the game, these are cults from different timelines of the same time loop.

447
00:28:09,937 --> 00:28:12,700
So as time loop goes on, it creates a bunch of parallel timelines,

448
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,702
and those cults come from those other timelines.

449
00:28:15,442 --> 00:28:20,828
And they reflect what Colt was in his previous cycles of memory and amnesia.

450
00:28:21,048 --> 00:28:25,273
What kind of opinions he had and how long he has come in his evolution as a character.

451
00:28:26,717 --> 00:28:30,978
So this actually harkens back to both main themes that I've mentioned,

452
00:28:31,238 --> 00:28:33,839
which is memory, because it shows a progression of cult.

453
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:36,940
So now he kind of can catch a glimpse of what he was before.

454
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,501
And also being stuck in a cycle, because those cults,

455
00:28:42,482 --> 00:28:45,282
through their faulty opinions or I know undeveloped...

456
00:28:45,802 --> 00:28:46,763
Oh, sorry.

457
00:28:50,784 --> 00:28:53,865
They could not break out of this.

458
00:28:56,893 --> 00:29:03,982
cycle. And it was realized in the game with, again, blocking cutscenes where we take control

459
00:29:04,022 --> 00:29:08,467
away from the player and they're pretty difficult to set up. They have a lot of overheads for LD

460
00:29:08,548 --> 00:29:13,494
and animation, etc. So they're pretty expensive, but we wanted something that would grab the

461
00:29:13,534 --> 00:29:14,255
player's attention 100%.

462
00:29:16,865 --> 00:29:23,790
And yeah, my takeaway here is that it was, I feel it was pretty successful because we gave the player

463
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:28,893
the information they needed in a way that they could not skip. And my takeaway here is that

464
00:29:28,953 --> 00:29:34,617
sometimes you need to go expensive with those things. So the visionaries, which are the main,

465
00:29:34,777 --> 00:29:39,420
the key targets that you need to kill, they're all the embodiment of the theme that you're

466
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:43,903
being stuck in a cycle due to immaturity. And some examples include like Charlie and Fia, who

467
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,162
are a couple and they break up every day and then they get back together the next day and

468
00:29:48,182 --> 00:29:51,585
they break up again and go back together and break up again and go back together. This is

469
00:29:51,645 --> 00:29:57,329
really horrible to watch. We have Igor who has this childish dream of being a respected scientist

470
00:29:57,369 --> 00:30:04,034
but he never puts in the work to gain either respect or scientific expertise. And we have

471
00:30:04,654 --> 00:30:09,918
Alexis. If you play the game, you know that this is a man who never left puberty, basically. He is

472
00:30:10,298 --> 00:30:12,060
immature in the most literal sense of the word.

473
00:30:14,142 --> 00:30:19,867
And the challenge with visionaries was to make them likeable and hateable at the same time.

474
00:30:20,648 --> 00:30:24,931
And it was a pretty difficult balance because we wanted players to like them and be interested in

475
00:30:24,971 --> 00:30:31,797
them so they would want to know more about them. But we also wanted players to think they suck

476
00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:37,482
as people and not feel very sorry about having to kill them because the player cannot finish

477
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,303
the game without killing all those visionaries.

478
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:47,964
And the likability part was actually turned out to be pretty easy. So we gave every one of those visionaries like a big

479
00:30:47,984 --> 00:30:54,369
personality that they were all larger than life and you know pre-bombasting and everything. And that doesn't necessarily

480
00:30:54,469 --> 00:30:55,430
make them likable.

481
00:30:57,071 --> 00:30:57,231
But.

482
00:30:57,593 --> 00:30:58,554
it creates interest.

483
00:30:58,654 --> 00:31:01,054
And over time, interest creates attachment.

484
00:31:01,774 --> 00:31:03,435
And I'm saying over time, and that

485
00:31:03,635 --> 00:31:05,795
is the unique benefit of having a time loop story,

486
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:08,855
is that you see those characters over and over again.

487
00:31:09,676 --> 00:31:14,216
And so you can get to know them better.

488
00:31:15,477 --> 00:31:17,417
And our saving grace was the humor.

489
00:31:17,877 --> 00:31:19,717
The game has a pretty light tone.

490
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:20,418
It's very humorous.

491
00:31:21,078 --> 00:31:23,598
So we made those characters very entertaining.

492
00:31:26,605 --> 00:31:29,327
If somebody makes you laugh, you cannot fully hate them.

493
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:35,572
And the testability part was pretty difficult on the other hand.

494
00:31:35,953 --> 00:31:39,716
So we had the original sin of the visionaries in that they are they

495
00:31:39,796 --> 00:31:44,740
escape the world to create this isolated party island that goes on for eternity.

496
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:49,964
And they used all of the resources in towns to escape rather than to help.

497
00:31:50,805 --> 00:31:57,992
you know make the world a better place. So the very foundation of what they were doing was wrong morally. And that makes them

498
00:31:58,032 --> 00:32:01,776
acceptable targets. But that didn't really land.

499
00:32:02,444 --> 00:32:04,927
for we need something more immediate, more practical.

500
00:32:05,727 --> 00:32:08,330
So we made them pretty depraved every single one of them.

501
00:32:09,031 --> 00:32:11,714
So for instance, Frank, who is the singer and a mobster,

502
00:32:12,634 --> 00:32:13,796
he shot a man in cold blood

503
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:16,478
for allegedly beating up his pianist

504
00:32:16,819 --> 00:32:18,741
and he claimed it was self-defense afterwards.

505
00:32:18,961 --> 00:32:20,502
And that was before the time loop started.

506
00:32:20,622 --> 00:32:23,866
So that person would not wake up the next day.

507
00:32:24,887 --> 00:32:32,053
And there's Harriet, who is leader of this cult, and she dips people in vats of corrosive gas

508
00:32:32,393 --> 00:32:41,581
just to, you know, get off. And there's obviously Alexis. So, in conclusion, I think we were pretty

509
00:32:41,661 --> 00:32:48,207
successful here. When you read the discussions online, people are saying that each of everybody

510
00:32:48,227 --> 00:32:49,928
has their favorite visionary. One of the...

511
00:32:51,491 --> 00:32:57,555
8 Visionaries is somebody's favorite and somebody felt sorry for killing one of them, but not too sorry.

512
00:32:57,635 --> 00:33:00,797
So we feel that we managed to strike a good balance there.

513
00:33:02,158 --> 00:33:07,802
And if we look at the eternalists, who are regular, mostly unnamed people who you kill by the hundreds,

514
00:33:07,842 --> 00:33:12,045
and it's really difficult to follow their stories because they die so easily and frequently.

515
00:33:13,382 --> 00:33:17,985
So we only were able to explore some of the stuck in a rut ideas

516
00:33:18,506 --> 00:33:20,327
with those characters, often, literally.

517
00:33:20,427 --> 00:33:24,910
So, you know, they start doing something really pointless

518
00:33:24,951 --> 00:33:26,632
and they say like, oh, I'm doing this thing today,

519
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:27,893
but tomorrow it's going to be better.

520
00:33:27,913 --> 00:33:29,434
I'm just going to make it better tomorrow.

521
00:33:29,814 --> 00:33:31,135
And tomorrow never comes, obviously.

522
00:33:31,696 --> 00:33:33,737
There's only one exception, which is Pick Craxley.

523
00:33:34,317 --> 00:33:38,420
And that's one of the eternalists, one eternalist who remembers.

524
00:33:38,561 --> 00:33:39,761
This is what she looks like.

525
00:33:39,802 --> 00:33:40,542
You meet her in the game.

526
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:42,506
in a side quest.

527
00:33:43,207 --> 00:33:46,029
And she's the only non-hostile Eternalist in the whole game.

528
00:33:47,169 --> 00:33:49,251
She is the only one person who is not wearing a mask.

529
00:33:50,211 --> 00:33:52,493
And she is sort of the voice of the Eternalist.

530
00:33:52,553 --> 00:33:55,615
So when you meet her and you talk to her,

531
00:33:55,655 --> 00:33:57,796
it's kind of a save the cat moment for a cult

532
00:33:58,277 --> 00:34:02,119
because the players understand that the cult's quest

533
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,761
is no longer for the sake of cult

534
00:34:04,881 --> 00:34:05,842
or for the sake of Juliana,

535
00:34:05,882 --> 00:34:07,503
but for the sake of everybody on the island.

536
00:34:08,606 --> 00:34:13,210
Peck-Rex, he makes it clear that, oh, you know, those people, those journalists who want to kill you,

537
00:34:15,092 --> 00:34:18,396
they maybe made a mistake. They were used by this, by those visionaries,

538
00:34:18,596 --> 00:34:24,322
and they certainly don't deserve being stuck on an island for eternity, without any memory to put.

539
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:30,359
So, for to summarize, Deathloop's story is about being stuck in a rut, as I've mentioned.

540
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,141
And we have two main themes, one being stuck in a vicious cycle due to immaturity.

541
00:34:34,602 --> 00:34:38,904
And this is explored with virtually all of the characters in the game

542
00:34:39,584 --> 00:34:41,885
on different levels, more implicitly, more explicitly.

543
00:34:41,905 --> 00:34:44,446
We have the other theme of memory.

544
00:34:44,466 --> 00:34:49,129
And this theme is mostly explored with characters who have persistent memory,

545
00:34:49,149 --> 00:34:50,569
like called Julian or Pic.

546
00:34:51,742 --> 00:34:56,324
And we don't really have character arcs.

547
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,944
In fact, the actions that the characters take

548
00:34:59,604 --> 00:35:00,885
illustrate their personalities.

549
00:35:01,185 --> 00:35:03,085
But those characters don't evolve over time

550
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:05,266
because it's a time loop and they have no memory.

551
00:35:05,346 --> 00:35:10,247
So they are back to their regular selves

552
00:35:10,747 --> 00:35:11,468
on the next morning.

553
00:35:14,488 --> 00:35:16,209
So let's talk about the features.

554
00:35:18,664 --> 00:35:21,245
So our narrative systems, and we have radio calls,

555
00:35:21,405 --> 00:35:22,885
which are called in Juliana banter.

556
00:35:23,345 --> 00:35:26,506
We have floating messages, which is just floating text,

557
00:35:27,666 --> 00:35:31,366
and hammer lines, which are called one-liners

558
00:35:31,667 --> 00:35:33,327
who are made for the benefit of the player.

559
00:35:34,127 --> 00:35:35,467
And we have all sorts of systems

560
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:37,028
that are staples of the genre,

561
00:35:37,808 --> 00:35:40,748
and that provide background lore and gameplay hints.

562
00:35:41,468 --> 00:35:44,269
So the radio calls, they sound something like this.

563
00:35:44,349 --> 00:35:45,129
I hope you have the audio.

564
00:35:45,438 --> 00:35:46,939
Frank, know you're coming. No need to thank me.

565
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:48,840
I wouldn't do that in a million years.

566
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,901
Huh. So you're going to kill your friend.

567
00:35:51,341 --> 00:35:52,021
How does that feel?

568
00:35:52,181 --> 00:35:53,802
What can I say that will make you shut up?

569
00:35:54,062 --> 00:35:54,902
Oh, so rocky.

570
00:35:55,363 --> 00:35:56,603
What are you, hungover or something?

571
00:35:56,883 --> 00:35:57,144
No.

572
00:35:57,444 --> 00:36:00,085
I know for a fact that you are, like every morning since we've met.

573
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:04,767
Yeah, so this is what it sounds like.

574
00:36:05,007 --> 00:36:08,349
Their conversation between Colt and Juliana over the radio.

575
00:36:09,544 --> 00:36:16,891
And the intention behind the system was to have a vehicle for the narrative that would be unlikely

576
00:36:16,911 --> 00:36:20,594
to be ignored or skipped by the player. There is nothing else interesting happening when those

577
00:36:20,774 --> 00:36:21,815
conversations are happening.

578
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,960
And originally the idea was that we would Frankenstein

579
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,361
those conversations from a collection of openings,

580
00:36:28,421 --> 00:36:29,061
middles and ends.

581
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:31,922
But that proved to be pretty difficult to execute

582
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:34,923
from the technical standpoint and in writing as well.

583
00:36:36,243 --> 00:36:38,804
And we were only allowed those conversations

584
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:39,524
at mission start.

585
00:36:39,584 --> 00:36:42,945
So we had a maximum 20 seconds before the player

586
00:36:42,985 --> 00:36:44,465
would engage it with some other content.

587
00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:51,751
And we couldn't play those conversations in combat because we couldn't swap out, you know,

588
00:36:51,811 --> 00:36:56,836
the reeds of lines for like a higher projection ones or something like that.

589
00:36:59,198 --> 00:37:04,443
And we really, really wanted to make those conversations feel as natural and as fun as

590
00:37:04,483 --> 00:37:04,823
possible.

591
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:10,636
And we need to remember as well that both Juliana and Colt have persistent memory.

592
00:37:10,676 --> 00:37:15,001
So Juliana should remember everything that she's saying and everything that Colt is saying

593
00:37:15,842 --> 00:37:21,088
and they should not repeat anything without acknowledging that they have already said that.

594
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:24,111
So this links back to the theme of memory.

595
00:37:25,246 --> 00:37:30,769
obviously. And in our final design, there were really short pieces of dialogue, like 15 seconds

596
00:37:30,789 --> 00:37:36,753
a piece. It was mostly style over substance to make those conversations really fun and free-flowing.

597
00:37:37,614 --> 00:37:41,876
And we only would sell you one piece of information per conversation. So they were easier

598
00:37:41,916 --> 00:37:46,659
to parse and we wouldn't have to, you know, do some kind of acrobatics to put in a lot of

599
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:52,343
information in it. And each of those conversations only happens once. If it plays, it's gone and you

600
00:37:52,383 --> 00:37:54,284
need to reset the play through to hear it again.

601
00:37:55,506 --> 00:38:01,750
So ultimately we hit a tone that we liked, which is this snarky banter between the two characters.

602
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:07,174
And of course there was the question of how much content we need to cover the entire game.

603
00:38:08,215 --> 00:38:13,999
So in preparation for that we listed all of the meaningful actions that the players could take

604
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:17,342
within a map, anything that warranted some kind of reaction.

605
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,363
and maybe, you know, what are the things that happen

606
00:38:21,403 --> 00:38:23,225
in those maps that the player should react to

607
00:38:23,405 --> 00:38:25,767
and would maybe want to discuss that with Giuliano.

608
00:38:27,168 --> 00:38:29,050
Also, we picked a list of interesting topics

609
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:31,793
from the lore, the backstory of the characters and the place.

610
00:38:33,594 --> 00:38:35,035
And we had some story choke points.

611
00:38:35,076 --> 00:38:38,158
So the critical information that the player needed to find

612
00:38:38,278 --> 00:38:39,760
out before they finished the game

613
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,341
to understand what the story was about.

614
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:47,861
And that list was obviously developed in close collaboration with our campaign designer, Dana,

615
00:38:49,043 --> 00:38:54,390
to make sure that we are covering everything. And initially we had a list of about 60 of those

616
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:58,857
conversations and then as the game evolved we ended up with about 70-75 of them.

617
00:39:00,846 --> 00:39:03,467
And only a couple of choke points have a fixed order.

618
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,927
For instance, when Colt finds out that he is Julianna's father,

619
00:39:07,588 --> 00:39:11,469
it triggers a conversation and there are a couple of conversations that come after that,

620
00:39:11,509 --> 00:39:13,989
that can only play after Colt has found out this information.

621
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:20,791
But everything else, like 90% of those conversations can happen at any time.

622
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:23,932
So they need to be written in a way that there is no conflict,

623
00:39:23,952 --> 00:39:26,812
that they don't reference some other conversation that maybe happened

624
00:39:26,872 --> 00:39:28,453
or maybe didn't happen at this point.

625
00:39:29,978 --> 00:39:33,419
And we were testing this with a prototype that we called the Trash Talker 9000.

626
00:39:33,919 --> 00:39:38,000
And unfortunately, we don't have time to go into any detail at all about it.

627
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:45,362
But luckily, I already did a presentation about this during the Digital Dragons conference

628
00:39:45,902 --> 00:39:48,382
two years ago, and it's called Don't Believe Everything You Think.

629
00:39:48,602 --> 00:39:54,124
And if you screen grab this slide, then you can watch it on YouTube in its entirety.

630
00:39:56,890 --> 00:40:02,515
But we executed this system with a massive linear visual script.

631
00:40:03,035 --> 00:40:05,157
It was the second biggest script of the whole game,

632
00:40:05,177 --> 00:40:08,920
and it was maintained by our scripter, Jean.

633
00:40:09,629 --> 00:40:10,790
who was not very happy about it.

634
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:17,174
And so we had a whole list of very specific triggers

635
00:40:17,234 --> 00:40:19,656
and conditions and priorities for those conversations.

636
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:23,018
And it needed to be enforced like really tightly

637
00:40:23,058 --> 00:40:23,678
in the script.

638
00:40:24,579 --> 00:40:27,441
And it was obviously revised multiple times

639
00:40:27,521 --> 00:40:29,762
as the game evolved and things were shifting, et cetera.

640
00:40:30,903 --> 00:40:33,724
And I wish we had invested more resources

641
00:40:34,284 --> 00:40:38,526
and more efficient nodes for Jean to use

642
00:40:39,466 --> 00:40:41,547
and some more robust debugging options

643
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:46,209
because that would have saved us a lot of time and stress.

644
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:50,110
So yeah, invest in your main features.

645
00:40:51,391 --> 00:40:52,131
Floating messages.

646
00:40:54,462 --> 00:40:59,464
look a little bit something like this and this is glowing non-UI text that contains vague thoughts

647
00:40:59,744 --> 00:41:05,966
and an occasional bit of useful information. Only Colt can see them but he talks to them

648
00:41:06,306 --> 00:41:11,808
and that makes it clear for the player that this is not UI, this is diegetic. And he also told

649
00:41:11,848 --> 00:41:16,970
Juliana that he's seeing those things so Juliana sometimes mentions it and that further confirms

650
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:17,710
that this is not UI.

651
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,081
And in the lore of the game, these are Colt's thoughts

652
00:41:22,141 --> 00:41:23,721
that were through the magic of the silent,

653
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,462
preserved somehow across time,

654
00:41:25,582 --> 00:41:27,222
and now they're popping back up for Colt.

655
00:41:27,262 --> 00:41:31,124
These are things that Colt had already thought some time ago,

656
00:41:31,784 --> 00:41:33,564
not in this playthrough, in any case.

657
00:41:34,605 --> 00:41:35,805
And from the design perspective,

658
00:41:35,825 --> 00:41:37,326
this is a really inexpensive system

659
00:41:37,546 --> 00:41:39,466
to provide mood and gameplay hints to the player,

660
00:41:39,646 --> 00:41:40,727
because this is just text.

661
00:41:41,107 --> 00:41:42,327
We can put it anywhere in the game.

662
00:41:42,707 --> 00:41:43,608
It doesn't break save games,

663
00:41:44,688 --> 00:41:45,948
and it's cheap in localization.

664
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:49,986
And this is an expression of the memory theme,

665
00:41:50,006 --> 00:41:52,687
because these are memories of past thoughts, obviously.

666
00:41:53,027 --> 00:41:56,008
And they also offer some reactivity to players' actions.

667
00:41:57,408 --> 00:42:01,369
And Sandra Duval, who was the lead narrative designer

668
00:42:01,409 --> 00:42:04,470
on Deathloop before I was in the company,

669
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:07,311
she originally came up with the system,

670
00:42:07,351 --> 00:42:10,311
and she spoke briefly about it at the Narrative Innovation

671
00:42:10,351 --> 00:42:10,752
Showcase.

672
00:42:11,012 --> 00:42:12,912
So if you've seen it, good for you.

673
00:42:12,972 --> 00:42:15,313
If not, maybe you will be able to watch it again.

674
00:42:17,352 --> 00:42:22,155
So the funny thing with those messages is that initially they were not actually very reactive.

675
00:42:22,555 --> 00:42:28,117
I mean, the system that runs those messages checks display conditions on map load. So

676
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:33,780
if you did something during the map, it would not trigger a message. It will only trigger a message

677
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:38,563
on the next map. So for instance, if you did something in the morning, you would get some

678
00:42:38,603 --> 00:42:41,484
payoff for it in the next time period at noon.

679
00:42:42,205 --> 00:42:44,246
And that was okay in the early stages of the game

680
00:42:44,286 --> 00:42:47,489
when missions took like five to 10 minutes,

681
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:49,411
but as the game evolved and grew bigger,

682
00:42:49,931 --> 00:42:52,053
people started spending in maps like 30, 40 minutes.

683
00:42:52,854 --> 00:42:57,818
And that was just too distant a payoff.

684
00:42:58,456 --> 00:43:03,039
to work. So we had to circumvent it with scripting. We have some messages that always pop up and they

685
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:09,303
are provide mood and there are a couple of messages that provide reactivity. So when we first tested

686
00:43:09,343 --> 00:43:14,627
this with players we got feedback that there were way too many messages. They obscured the

687
00:43:14,867 --> 00:43:19,250
scenery which was not appreciated by our colleagues in the level art department

688
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:25,414
and they were not very useful and therefore they were pretty forgettable.

689
00:43:26,678 --> 00:43:31,740
So we made some changes to this design, we streamlined the lore a little bit, and we

690
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:37,463
identified four distinct moods that showcase the evolution of cults' thoughts. And actually,

691
00:43:37,503 --> 00:43:41,385
those moods were consistent with those visitor cults.

692
00:43:42,379 --> 00:43:44,640
you know, the other cults from the past they meet.

693
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:50,702
And so for instance, if there was a cult who is like this very,

694
00:43:50,762 --> 00:43:54,944
you know, brooding, kind of, oh my god, nothing is going to work,

695
00:43:55,104 --> 00:43:58,865
but just doom and gloom cult, and we have such doom and gloom messages.

696
00:43:59,646 --> 00:44:02,327
And there's another cult who is like crazy and he just wants to kill

697
00:44:02,347 --> 00:44:04,367
everybody and he doesn't care because he doesn't remember.

698
00:44:04,548 --> 00:44:08,109
And we also have messages that kind of reflect that berserk feeling.

699
00:44:08,929 --> 00:44:12,072
And each of those moods is slightly visually different.

700
00:44:13,793 --> 00:44:15,315
We include some gameplay information,

701
00:44:15,375 --> 00:44:16,756
some, you know, pull this lever

702
00:44:16,976 --> 00:44:19,718
or watch out there are enemies nearby

703
00:44:19,879 --> 00:44:22,661
or this is a good place to snipe, this kind of thing.

704
00:44:23,542 --> 00:44:26,444
And we made those messages a lot less frequent.

705
00:44:26,704 --> 00:44:30,007
So there were fewer of them, so they would pop up more.

706
00:44:31,309 --> 00:44:34,492
And we added the time variant, which was more visually pleasing,

707
00:44:34,532 --> 00:44:36,414
because you had like one message that would pop up,

708
00:44:36,454 --> 00:44:38,716
and there was a sequence of other messages that went after it.

709
00:44:40,218 --> 00:44:43,000
And we opted for more dramatic setups overall,

710
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:44,562
just to make them more memorable.

711
00:44:45,102 --> 00:44:47,425
And this is one example of such a dramatic setup,

712
00:44:47,445 --> 00:44:49,226
where you have this giant billboard.

713
00:44:52,109 --> 00:44:55,893
And here is how the four different moods look like.

714
00:44:57,588 --> 00:44:59,848
The difference in the visuals is pretty subtle.

715
00:45:00,328 --> 00:45:01,269
It's pretty subliminal.

716
00:45:01,929 --> 00:45:05,069
But it gives the eye something different to process.

717
00:45:05,249 --> 00:45:10,810
So immediately, it's a little bit more memorable.

718
00:45:12,771 --> 00:45:14,211
So let's talk about the hammer lines.

719
00:45:15,511 --> 00:45:17,632
And hammer lines are just one-liners

720
00:45:17,672 --> 00:45:19,532
from Colt who comments on stuff.

721
00:45:19,752 --> 00:45:21,753
And here's an example.

722
00:45:21,893 --> 00:45:23,533
And in this example, Colt is dealing

723
00:45:23,573 --> 00:45:25,153
with a voice-activated door lock.

724
00:45:29,192 --> 00:45:29,432
Ocean.

725
00:45:30,612 --> 00:45:31,173
Pearl diver.

726
00:45:31,193 --> 00:45:32,454
No, no, no, no, no, no.

727
00:45:33,114 --> 00:45:34,775
It's got to be military.

728
00:45:36,676 --> 00:45:37,096
Bomb.

729
00:45:39,058 --> 00:45:39,558
How is this?

730
00:45:41,699 --> 00:45:44,601
So yeah, these are lines spoken by Colt,

731
00:45:44,901 --> 00:45:49,144
and he comments on objectives, discoveries that he makes,

732
00:45:49,484 --> 00:45:51,305
and attracts the player's attention

733
00:45:51,345 --> 00:45:52,586
to some objects in the environment.

734
00:45:53,891 --> 00:45:58,733
And initially, we wanted to avoid this kind of thing at all costs.

735
00:45:58,793 --> 00:46:02,494
We didn't want the player to, you know, the characters just going around and say like,

736
00:46:02,534 --> 00:46:04,435
hmm, this door looks like it could be opened.

737
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:09,136
Because we've seen it in many games and we thought that it was really unimmersive

738
00:46:09,316 --> 00:46:11,777
and because nobody talks to themselves like that.

739
00:46:13,665 --> 00:46:16,406
But when we started testing the game with players,

740
00:46:16,966 --> 00:46:20,167
it became clear that people had a really hard time

741
00:46:20,187 --> 00:46:22,227
following the story because it's plenty of discoveries,

742
00:46:22,267 --> 00:46:23,428
plenty of realizations.

743
00:46:24,308 --> 00:46:26,428
And the players were reading something

744
00:46:26,568 --> 00:46:30,109
that had this amazing reveal, et cetera,

745
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:32,070
and it just wasn't landing.

746
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:33,130
People were like, okay, whatever.

747
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:36,211
And suddenly they were asking themselves,

748
00:46:36,291 --> 00:46:38,992
why does the character know something that I don't?

749
00:46:39,232 --> 00:46:42,033
Why do I have those objectives that I don't understand?

750
00:46:42,908 --> 00:46:46,109
So we tested a couple of those hammer lines,

751
00:46:46,169 --> 00:46:48,749
because you know, you hammer the player on the head with it.

752
00:46:50,589 --> 00:46:53,010
And they really worked well.

753
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:55,270
People started grokking basically that,

754
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:59,251
oh, something important happened here, now I understand.

755
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:04,252
And so in the end, we added a whole bunch of those,

756
00:47:04,312 --> 00:47:07,313
like plenty, and this had a pretty interesting effect.

757
00:47:08,398 --> 00:47:15,200
on Colt as a character because it fleshed him out as a pretty chatty guy and it aligned very well

758
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:20,561
with his persona in the radio calls where he was throwing those one-liners with Juliana.

759
00:47:21,562 --> 00:47:26,863
So my takeaway here is even if you think something is overused or doesn't really work well,

760
00:47:27,683 --> 00:47:28,983
if it aligns with your character,

761
00:47:29,795 --> 00:47:36,078
And if you really take your time to write it and try to make it original and funny and interesting,

762
00:47:36,578 --> 00:47:43,441
then it can work. And that is actually a confirmation of a very old lesson that any

763
00:47:43,501 --> 00:47:49,523
trope cliche or any overused tool can be effective if you use it well in the right context.

764
00:47:51,544 --> 00:47:53,285
So let's go through the

765
00:47:54,277 --> 00:47:59,704
the other systems. So things as notes, tapes, etc. They are known to any Arkane fan and they're

766
00:47:59,744 --> 00:48:04,770
pretty very widespread in the other games. So notes are basically collectible pieces of text

767
00:48:05,371 --> 00:48:10,277
that provide lore and gameplay information. Tapes are basically or audio logs. They're

768
00:48:10,297 --> 00:48:11,959
basically notes but with voiceover.

769
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,822
Overheard conversations is when two or more NPCs discuss something

770
00:48:16,863 --> 00:48:19,204
and their conversation reveals some sort of information

771
00:48:19,945 --> 00:48:22,527
or maybe leads you to some sort of side content.

772
00:48:23,648 --> 00:48:25,729
And speaker announcements are just, you know,

773
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:30,793
a voice oozing from a speaker and providing some information

774
00:48:30,833 --> 00:48:32,394
about content that you may have missed.

775
00:48:33,816 --> 00:48:36,718
So all of those features in Deathloop are pretty similar

776
00:48:37,759 --> 00:48:40,381
in that they have very little to no dynamic

777
00:48:40,421 --> 00:48:41,361
or reactive content.

778
00:48:42,443 --> 00:48:46,046
they are in fact the embodiment of the infallible repetition of the loop.

779
00:48:47,047 --> 00:48:50,109
They always happen at the same time, they always provide the same information,

780
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:54,994
they always happen in the same places. And so they reflect the theme of being stuck in a cycle

781
00:48:55,314 --> 00:48:56,495
or of being in a time loop.

782
00:48:58,264 --> 00:49:03,627
So it builds familiarity of the player with the map and the lore of the game,

783
00:49:04,707 --> 00:49:05,828
and it helps them make plans.

784
00:49:05,988 --> 00:49:09,830
So because those things always happen the same way and always provide the same information,

785
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:13,532
you can plan around them to exploit them for your own benefit.

786
00:49:15,113 --> 00:49:19,535
And we did really our best to make them as funny, varied, and original as we could,

787
00:49:20,355 --> 00:49:24,778
so you would enjoy listening to them or reading them, you know, after a hundred times, etc.

788
00:49:26,008 --> 00:49:28,709
And there's one notable variation in this system,

789
00:49:28,769 --> 00:49:29,770
which are the minicomps.

790
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:31,591
And minicomps are those computers.

791
00:49:33,732 --> 00:49:36,614
And it's a chat system used by the visionaries that

792
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,114
reacts to player actions.

793
00:49:39,215 --> 00:49:40,916
So they are, in fact, notes.

794
00:49:41,376 --> 00:49:45,358
But they're linked with sort of a script tree.

795
00:49:46,467 --> 00:49:48,950
and they are reactive to some of the actions of the player.

796
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:52,272
So they're visionaries, they're just talking, you know, shit.

797
00:49:53,033 --> 00:49:56,075
And sometimes if somebody dies, then it loads up a note

798
00:49:56,136 --> 00:49:58,618
where this visionary who is dead is no longer present.

799
00:49:58,778 --> 00:50:00,219
And maybe some of the other characters come in,

800
00:50:00,379 --> 00:50:01,780
oh, have you heard that this guy is dead?

801
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,241
Oh, I didn't know, who killed him?

802
00:50:03,582 --> 00:50:04,502
Well, called, obviously.

803
00:50:05,443 --> 00:50:10,167
And those minicoms provide very important progression information.

804
00:50:10,187 --> 00:50:11,929
They give you a lot of hints on how to break the loop.

805
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,152
And they have this very unique in-game look

806
00:50:15,193 --> 00:50:16,394
with this computer, basically.

807
00:50:16,915 --> 00:50:20,479
So my takeaway here is that if you give a different aspect

808
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:22,742
to something that is already familiar,

809
00:50:22,922 --> 00:50:25,185
you effectively make it different in the eyes of the player.

810
00:50:25,586 --> 00:50:27,548
So you can get more mileage out of the same,

811
00:50:27,929 --> 00:50:29,150
you know, gameplay system that you have.

812
00:50:30,687 --> 00:50:33,787
And minicoms reflect both main themes.

813
00:50:33,807 --> 00:50:37,608
They're stuck in a cycle because the visionaries always

814
00:50:37,648 --> 00:50:38,369
say the same thing.

815
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:42,550
And also memory, because if the player does something weird,

816
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:44,950
then it will comment on that.

817
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:47,871
So it responds to player actions.

818
00:50:47,991 --> 00:50:50,792
But as soon as the next day falls over,

819
00:50:52,532 --> 00:50:53,993
it's back to the same conversation again.

820
00:50:54,033 --> 00:50:56,013
If you do nothing, they will repeat 100 times

821
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:56,553
the same thing.

822
00:50:58,654 --> 00:50:58,854
So.

823
00:51:00,882 --> 00:51:03,664
Our main themes, which are also realizations

824
00:51:03,724 --> 00:51:05,645
of our main design goals, are expressed

825
00:51:05,805 --> 00:51:07,285
across all of the narrative systems.

826
00:51:07,746 --> 00:51:10,367
And anything that has persistent or reactive content

827
00:51:10,447 --> 00:51:12,968
links to memory, because it offers players progression.

828
00:51:13,649 --> 00:51:15,670
So radio calls, floating messages, and minicoms

829
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:16,430
are all part of this.

830
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:19,171
And any non-reactive content, links

831
00:51:19,191 --> 00:51:22,093
to being stuck in a cycle, illustrates the repeatability

832
00:51:22,133 --> 00:51:22,613
of the loop.

833
00:51:23,093 --> 00:51:24,774
So it gives you an impression of being in the loop.

834
00:51:24,814 --> 00:51:27,616
So those are notes, tapes, the overheard conversations,

835
00:51:27,676 --> 00:51:28,316
et cetera, et cetera.

836
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:32,923
And so in conclusion of this talk,

837
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:37,566
each game offers challenges because of its setting

838
00:51:37,586 --> 00:51:39,027
and its gameplay loop.

839
00:51:39,568 --> 00:51:43,190
So you as narrative designer needs to embrace that.

840
00:51:44,365 --> 00:51:49,347
and identify what are your key design problems and maybe try to align them with your themes.

841
00:51:49,867 --> 00:51:54,370
And then you can use that to orient your work because anything you do to realize a theme

842
00:51:54,790 --> 00:52:02,353
also realizes one of your design goals. And each time you try to realize a design goal and

843
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:06,615
make sure that you're really executing it, it also illustrates your themes.

844
00:52:07,256 --> 00:52:10,798
So it gives a very consistent experience to the player.

845
00:52:12,131 --> 00:52:17,956
And in Deathloop, this was an organic process that evolved through many iteration cycles,

846
00:52:18,236 --> 00:52:21,019
and we were fortunate to have enough time to make it work.

847
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:25,864
And we couldn't have done that without testing with players and user research.

848
00:52:26,684 --> 00:52:28,686
It was an extremely valuable tool.

849
00:52:30,055 --> 00:52:34,516
And when you have big moments, then make sure to pay them off

850
00:52:34,896 --> 00:52:39,657
correctly to the player. And if you have things that kind of go outside of the story,

851
00:52:39,677 --> 00:52:44,999
make sure to make them big moments and then pay them off. And of course, we should never forget

852
00:52:45,019 --> 00:52:50,240
the rudiments. So themes, consistency, characters, conflict, all of that is important in a time

853
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:57,822
loop story, in any story. And I would like to thank the whole narrative team at Arkane.

854
00:52:59,082 --> 00:53:06,887
people who we worked with, the people who worked on the narrative before I came and who were very

855
00:53:06,927 --> 00:53:13,292
kind and shared their insights on the early days of the project. So, Saszka and Sophie, thank you very much.

856
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:19,876
And I'd like to thank everybody at GDC. It's my first time here. And particularly, I would like

857
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:26,081
to thank Osama Dorias, who invited me to do this talk and who also helped me get into the industry

858
00:53:26,101 --> 00:53:31,685
to begin with. I'm sorry I couldn't be there this year in person, but, you know, sometime we'll

859
00:53:31,705 --> 00:53:35,708
finally do it. And Caroline Marshall, without whom this presentation would be...

860
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:44,594
a complete mess. So thank you very much for reading my stuff and my fellow speakers from

861
00:53:44,654 --> 00:53:51,358
Arkane Lyon, Dana, Megan and Gilles and literally the whole team at Arkane. And anybody who may have

862
00:53:51,398 --> 00:53:56,100
forgotten, thank you. And if you would like to be in the thank yous, we are actually hiring

863
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,622
a whole bunch of positions, so don't hesitate.

864
00:54:01,623 --> 00:54:05,788
And in case you missed, we had a whole bunch of talks this year.

865
00:54:05,888 --> 00:54:07,109
They're all already done.

866
00:54:07,389 --> 00:54:09,572
But maybe you can see them in a replay or on the vault.

867
00:54:10,593 --> 00:54:11,394
So thank you very much.

868
00:54:11,494 --> 00:54:12,174
I'll take questions now.

869
00:54:21,601 --> 00:54:23,983
Hello, thanks for giving such a great talk.

870
00:54:24,103 --> 00:54:27,346
I wanted to ask about one key shift that happens in the game

871
00:54:27,366 --> 00:54:30,148
that you mentioned, the revelation of Juliana

872
00:54:30,168 --> 00:54:31,049
being Colt's daughter.

873
00:54:31,069 --> 00:54:34,372
This is a giant tonal shift from sort of how the game

874
00:54:34,392 --> 00:54:36,353
was both advertised and how you first experienced it.

875
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:38,155
There's a line early in the game where Colt wonders

876
00:54:38,175 --> 00:54:38,835
a lot of these data.

877
00:54:38,855 --> 00:54:39,276
Juliana.

878
00:54:40,256 --> 00:54:42,377
There is a narrative reason why they're close to the same age.

879
00:54:43,117 --> 00:54:44,657
What was the consideration for that point?

880
00:54:44,717 --> 00:54:47,598
Because for me and some other people who played the game,

881
00:54:47,638 --> 00:54:50,578
that was a very big shock to suddenly go have this character

882
00:54:50,598 --> 00:54:53,099
who you're in kind of a flirty spy versus spy thing going.

883
00:54:53,579 --> 00:54:55,559
And then suddenly it's like, oh, she's your daughter.

884
00:54:55,579 --> 00:54:59,020
That's a very... that was just suddenly like a big, like, tunnel shift.

885
00:54:59,380 --> 00:54:59,660
Thank you.

886
00:55:00,801 --> 00:55:01,921
Yeah, so...

887
00:55:04,421 --> 00:55:04,741
We...

888
00:55:06,182 --> 00:55:06,502
It was...

889
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:11,391
you know, the wish of, well, basically,

890
00:55:12,672 --> 00:55:14,152
it was supposed from the beginning

891
00:55:14,172 --> 00:55:15,993
that Colt and Juliana are actually related.

892
00:55:16,053 --> 00:55:19,395
This was a thing that we had to make sure

893
00:55:19,515 --> 00:55:22,416
was revealed fairly late in the game.

894
00:55:23,277 --> 00:55:28,940
So, this whole, let's say, red herring

895
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,142
with them being flirty was basically to conceal,

896
00:55:33,582 --> 00:55:36,503
to prevent people from guessing too early

897
00:55:36,563 --> 00:55:37,924
that they are related.

898
00:55:39,156 --> 00:55:48,105
And because of how fiction works and how relationships

899
00:55:48,145 --> 00:55:54,010
between the main characters are shaped in storytelling overall,

900
00:55:55,252 --> 00:55:57,374
there was actually not many things

901
00:55:57,414 --> 00:55:58,535
that we could use to conceal that.

902
00:56:01,248 --> 00:56:06,092
And so we opted to go in the direction of them having...

903
00:56:06,212 --> 00:56:08,834
Because Colt is completely unaware that Juliana could be his daughter.

904
00:56:08,874 --> 00:56:12,477
Like you said, there's a narrative reason why they appear to be the same age.

905
00:56:13,377 --> 00:56:19,482
And so they're basically two conclusions that you can draw based on the stereotypical

906
00:56:21,384 --> 00:56:24,426
storytelling is that either they are related or they have been a couple.

907
00:56:24,946 --> 00:56:27,187
or the Arab couple or love interests of some sort.

908
00:56:27,727 --> 00:56:30,928
So we leaned into that one thing to kind of distract players

909
00:56:30,988 --> 00:56:32,549
from thinking that the other was possible

910
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:37,590
and that made it possible to make this revelation

911
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:39,191
that Juliana is actually called stutter

912
00:56:39,211 --> 00:56:40,952
a big reveal later on.

913
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:42,792
Very good, thank you.

914
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:45,901
Hi, thanks so much for the talk.

915
00:56:46,381 --> 00:56:48,922
I recently finished Deathloop, and I really adored it.

916
00:56:48,942 --> 00:56:53,605
I had a question about the visionary missions and stuff.

917
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:57,988
So how you can, you know, they span through the entire game,

918
00:56:58,028 --> 00:56:59,729
and you can work on one mission in the morning,

919
00:56:59,769 --> 00:57:01,090
working on, like, Alexis,

920
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:02,851
and then handle another one in the afternoon.

921
00:57:03,271 --> 00:57:05,433
How did you guys handle kind of making it

922
00:57:05,493 --> 00:57:06,413
so the player could...

923
00:57:07,074 --> 00:57:12,179
Jump from mission to mission and kind of like, you know work on them all in tandem without it feeling

924
00:57:13,019 --> 00:57:14,701
Like disjointed there were some missions

925
00:57:14,761 --> 00:57:19,125
I started in like the beginning of the game and then I it was one of the like last ones I finished

926
00:57:19,546 --> 00:57:21,007
So like how did you guys tackle that?

927
00:57:22,008 --> 00:57:23,149
like a nonlinear

928
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:24,410
approach

929
00:57:25,376 --> 00:57:33,819
Yeah, so that's actually one of the biggest issues that we were facing with the game.

930
00:57:34,059 --> 00:57:39,621
So initially, the missions were a lot simpler than they ended up being.

931
00:57:40,441 --> 00:57:47,503
And we realized in testing that you could actually beat the game in like one hour if you optimize your actions.

932
00:57:47,723 --> 00:57:50,043
So that's where the leads came from.

933
00:57:50,163 --> 00:57:59,225
We basically shifted away from focusing on missions that feature the visionaries, you know, where you need to kill them as the main attraction.

934
00:57:59,965 --> 00:58:06,567
And that was only that started being only the thing that appears on the outside that this is what you need to focus on.

935
00:58:06,827 --> 00:58:09,848
But what you actually need to focus on is to getting the visionaries.

936
00:58:11,549 --> 00:58:14,872
to move from their usual routines to put them,

937
00:58:15,373 --> 00:58:18,035
to align them in a way that you could take them out

938
00:58:18,295 --> 00:58:18,896
at the same time.

939
00:58:19,497 --> 00:58:20,157
And that took...

940
00:58:21,067 --> 00:58:26,330
an enormous amount of iteration and testing and brainstorming and,

941
00:58:26,790 --> 00:58:28,592
you know, redoing the missions over and over again

942
00:58:29,913 --> 00:58:35,676
to make sure that we gave you we give players enough steps in those missions

943
00:58:35,836 --> 00:58:40,339
to for them to feel sufficiently complex so they can complete them very quickly.

944
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:54,412
But also to be simple enough so you could follow what is even going on, what is the idea behind those leads, those stratagems to put them in different places.

945
00:58:54,492 --> 00:58:59,117
So actually the idea is always very simple.

946
00:59:02,229 --> 00:59:05,472
prevent Igor from going to the party by sabotaging his experiment.

947
00:59:05,552 --> 00:59:10,336
So you sabotage Igor's experiment, and then he goes to the party.

948
00:59:10,416 --> 00:59:16,141
And this in itself is like a very simple idea, but it's built around several actions that

949
00:59:16,161 --> 00:59:18,623
you need to undertake to make it happen.

950
00:59:18,863 --> 00:59:23,247
And I guess that, well, the reply is really a lot of time and iteration.

951
00:59:24,048 --> 00:59:24,468
Gotcha.

952
00:59:24,528 --> 00:59:24,688
Cool.

953
00:59:24,728 --> 00:59:25,029
Thank you.

954
00:59:26,009 --> 00:59:26,250
Thank you.

955
00:59:35,282 --> 00:59:37,364
I have a question then if there's time for one.

956
00:59:37,845 --> 00:59:43,793
So there's this moment in the game that a character goes on a rant and it's called

957
00:59:43,873 --> 00:59:44,353
The Runt.

958
00:59:44,474 --> 00:59:45,595
I think it's Alexis.

959
00:59:46,196 --> 00:59:48,399
And I used to be a management consultant.

960
00:59:48,479 --> 00:59:51,763
I used to be a business person and I literally sent that.

961
00:59:52,704 --> 00:59:58,289
sequence to all of my friends that I used to work with because it reflects the psyche of high

962
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:06,276
ambition business people extremely well. What gave you the insight or who on the team had insight to write a sequence like this?

963
01:00:08,454 --> 01:00:17,801
I believe this sequence was originally written by Joe Fielder, who is one of our contract writers on Deathloop.

964
01:00:18,602 --> 01:00:28,349
And we asked him, can you do like a rant of Alex's where he kind of talks all about his business prowess, etc.

965
01:00:28,429 --> 01:00:31,311
And he sent us this and it was...

966
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:37,385
amazing, but yeah, Joe Fielder, I believe he is actually in person at the GDC.

967
01:00:37,825 --> 01:00:40,509
So if you manage to find him, you can ask him the question directly.

968
01:00:40,529 --> 01:00:41,490
Awesome.

969
01:00:41,530 --> 01:00:41,830
Thank you.

970
01:00:42,531 --> 01:00:42,771
Thank you.

971
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:47,341
Hello, my name is Kim.

972
01:00:47,381 --> 01:00:48,662
Thank you so much for the talk.

973
01:00:48,743 --> 01:00:51,125
I'm a huge fan of Arcane and especially Deathloop.

974
01:00:51,685 --> 01:00:56,269
I wanted to ask if during the building of Deathloop,

975
01:00:56,329 --> 01:00:59,632
if there was any inspiration to either add more visionaries

976
01:01:00,092 --> 01:01:01,894
or reduce the amount of visionaries.

977
01:01:02,935 --> 01:01:05,437
And if there was any thought about like why there's seven,

978
01:01:05,497 --> 01:01:08,119
seven and a half, if you count Tuba or Juliana.

979
01:01:09,605 --> 01:01:17,751
Yeah, so, no, as far as I can tell, it was always meant to be this number of visionaries and not any other number.

980
01:01:18,072 --> 01:01:24,577
Of course, it's an odd number because odd numbers are objectively better in storytelling than anything else.

981
01:01:24,697 --> 01:01:30,402
So you always get three acts, five chapters, seven evil acts and nine visionaries.

982
01:01:31,403 --> 01:01:32,724
or eight or seven.

983
01:01:32,824 --> 01:01:35,866
Well, in any case, no, there was never any plan

984
01:01:35,926 --> 01:01:37,688
to have fewer visionaries than this

985
01:01:37,728 --> 01:01:39,489
because it needed to be difficult.

986
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:42,352
The idea that you have four periods of day,

987
01:01:42,592 --> 01:01:44,934
so only four missions per day,

988
01:01:45,374 --> 01:01:49,017
but eight people to kill, it sounds impossible.

989
01:01:49,197 --> 01:01:52,060
And that's what was needed for Deathloop to,

990
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:53,901
you know, how do you break the slope

991
01:01:54,462 --> 01:01:56,303
if there's this impossible task to achieve?

992
01:01:57,604 --> 01:01:58,245
Thank you so much.

993
01:01:58,906 --> 01:01:59,186
Thank you.

994
01:02:00,924 --> 01:02:03,367
And that's all the time I have.

995
01:02:03,407 --> 01:02:04,028
Thank you very much.

996
01:02:04,048 --> 01:02:10,957
Thank you.
