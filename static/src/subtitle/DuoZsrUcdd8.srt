1
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:11,391
Just to say at the beginning, remember to rate all the talks and things, especially

2
00:00:11,391 --> 00:00:15,973
this one, and turn off your cell phones, make them quiet.

3
00:00:15,973 --> 00:00:18,935
I'm Brandon Sheffield from Necrosoft Games.

4
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:24,438
I also am the person who runs this career seminar thing.

5
00:00:24,438 --> 00:00:25,558
So if you...

6
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:29,820
I appreciate all the ratings that you give because it helps me know what you like and

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,063
don't and leave comments in there and just feel free to tell me anything about what you

8
00:00:34,063 --> 00:00:37,445
like and don't so we can improve for next year.

9
00:00:37,445 --> 00:00:46,870
So this talk is called How and When to Not Give Up on Your Game because I believe that

10
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:47,891
if you have a game...

11
00:00:49,195 --> 00:00:53,817
of any type that is good, you can get money from it.

12
00:00:53,817 --> 00:00:56,479
Not necessarily from selling it to people,

13
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:58,660
because that's incredibly difficult,

14
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,702
but perhaps more easily through selling to platforms.

15
00:01:01,702 --> 00:01:07,145
So this is all about our kind of weird production model

16
00:01:07,145 --> 00:01:08,626
and business model that we have.

17
00:01:09,162 --> 00:01:19,446
Because we make games that are not that popular, we've never had a hit, but we've survived for five years anyway.

18
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:23,567
So, I mean, that's got to stand for something.

19
00:01:24,688 --> 00:01:29,813
So yeah, essentially the thing that we're talking about is getting new platforms to

20
00:01:29,813 --> 00:01:35,258
pay us for a small version of our game, then another new platform to pay for a slightly

21
00:01:35,258 --> 00:01:39,242
larger version of that game, then another, until the game is finished.

22
00:01:40,837 --> 00:01:47,778
This is how we get finished games that we own 100% with no publisher, even if the games

23
00:01:47,778 --> 00:01:52,799
themselves don't necessarily sell like gangbusters because they're on these small platforms.

24
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,920
Then eventually we can put them on a wider platform and hopefully do well.

25
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,262
So with a little luck I will be able to teach you to scam platforms out of their hard-earned

26
00:02:02,262 --> 00:02:04,682
cash in order to fund your own games.

27
00:02:06,023 --> 00:02:08,585
How'd that get there?

28
00:02:08,585 --> 00:02:10,567
How it works is this.

29
00:02:10,567 --> 00:02:13,089
New platforms need new games.

30
00:02:13,089 --> 00:02:15,691
When they're new, they'll give you money

31
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:20,495
because they need games to attract players and users.

32
00:02:20,495 --> 00:02:23,317
And that's the thing that makes them popular.

33
00:02:23,317 --> 00:02:26,079
Because developers don't want to release games on new platforms

34
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,841
usually because they're unproven.

35
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:32,304
And it's less likely you will be able to get revenue

36
00:02:32,304 --> 00:02:32,985
on the back end.

37
00:02:34,444 --> 00:02:36,786
So they have to pay for the first games they get,

38
00:02:36,786 --> 00:02:39,647
and this is when we try to swoop in

39
00:02:39,647 --> 00:02:42,249
because once they're popular,

40
00:02:42,249 --> 00:02:43,610
they don't need you anymore,

41
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,071
and that's it for you.

42
00:02:46,071 --> 00:02:49,173
They don't need to fund games

43
00:02:49,173 --> 00:02:51,054
if they have a popular platform.

44
00:02:51,054 --> 00:02:54,617
Like, imagine if you went to Valve

45
00:02:54,617 --> 00:02:56,538
and was like, hey, can you give me money

46
00:02:56,538 --> 00:02:58,839
to release my game on your platform?

47
00:02:58,839 --> 00:02:59,900
They're gonna say no.

48
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:04,003
But yeah, look at Sony for example.

49
00:03:04,003 --> 00:03:07,985
They, at the start of every console cycle,

50
00:03:07,985 --> 00:03:11,107
they're like, yay, indies, look at all these amazing indies

51
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,668
that we have funded and put on our platform.

52
00:03:12,668 --> 00:03:15,110
And then as the console gets more mature,

53
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:19,313
they're like, yay, Call of Duty, it's here.

54
00:03:19,313 --> 00:03:24,236
So, like I said, we take a small amount of money,

55
00:03:24,236 --> 00:03:26,237
make a small version of this game idea that we have.

56
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:30,916
We build the core of a game that is fun and good as it is,

57
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,798
but isn't huge or expansive.

58
00:03:32,798 --> 00:03:36,902
It's not, it's like the very center of our idea

59
00:03:36,902 --> 00:03:39,804
because these platforms don't really care

60
00:03:39,804 --> 00:03:41,766
if you've got the longest game in the world.

61
00:03:41,766 --> 00:03:43,688
They care that it's fun and good

62
00:03:43,688 --> 00:03:45,910
and most importantly, there.

63
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:50,915
So then what do you do with that game next?

64
00:03:51,661 --> 00:03:55,644
After you've made that core and it's released on this small obscure platform, then you find

65
00:03:55,644 --> 00:04:00,469
another. And you get a little more money and you release it there. And you keep doing that

66
00:04:00,469 --> 00:04:06,014
until you have it in the state where it has matched your vision.

67
00:04:09,065 --> 00:04:12,469
So the traditional way to make money off of your games

68
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:16,113
is to sell them, but it's incredibly hard to sell things

69
00:04:16,113 --> 00:04:19,297
now, especially if nobody knows who you are

70
00:04:19,297 --> 00:04:23,862
and what your game is about from having previous hit

71
00:04:23,862 --> 00:04:25,143
games or something.

72
00:04:25,143 --> 00:04:28,407
Like, a bajillion games are released every five minutes,

73
00:04:28,407 --> 00:04:29,488
so it's impossible to.

74
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:35,955
get noticed practically. But by selling to platforms you can expect about

75
00:04:35,955 --> 00:04:40,160
twenty to thirty thousand dollars per one of these deals

76
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,144
and if you can make that work for yourself then

77
00:04:43,144 --> 00:04:45,186
there's something you might be able to do there.

78
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:49,491
Look at that guy.

79
00:04:49,491 --> 00:04:53,575
Most companies do the top model.

80
00:04:53,575 --> 00:04:55,977
By the way, my girlfriend did these graphics here,

81
00:04:55,977 --> 00:05:00,683
which is why some slides look way better than other slides.

82
00:05:00,683 --> 00:05:02,765
I can't do anything but write terrible text.

83
00:05:04,026 --> 00:05:09,835
So, on the top there, most traditional companies will do a prototype, then they'll try to get funding,

84
00:05:09,835 --> 00:05:12,880
then they will finish the game, and then they release version 1.0.

85
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,066
Or in the case of Free-to-Play, they'll update it forever, or as long as they're getting money.

86
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,108
What we do is...

87
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,611
First two steps are the same, prototype, get funding.

88
00:05:22,611 --> 00:05:25,592
And then initial, sometimes rough, version 1.0

89
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:27,312
is on a small platform.

90
00:05:27,312 --> 00:05:29,732
1.25 on a different small platform.

91
00:05:29,732 --> 00:05:30,393
1.5 on yet another.

92
00:05:30,393 --> 00:05:33,133
And then we get to version 2.0, which we

93
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:34,933
can release on a big platform.

94
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:38,554
And our version 2.0 is kind of close

95
00:05:38,554 --> 00:05:40,274
to the traditional models 1.0, except we've

96
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:44,175
had a lot of iterative releases.

97
00:05:44,175 --> 00:05:47,676
And so we're sometimes able to iron out.

98
00:05:47,956 --> 00:05:49,737
more of the bugs that way.

99
00:05:49,737 --> 00:05:56,481
So, let's look, oh right, also just in both models of course,

100
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:59,382
once you've released it on a larger platform,

101
00:05:59,382 --> 00:06:02,104
you can also then curate down again,

102
00:06:02,104 --> 00:06:06,206
like say you go to PC as your big platform you're going to.

103
00:06:06,206 --> 00:06:08,187
After that you can go to console,

104
00:06:08,187 --> 00:06:11,689
and then like a handheld console or something like that.

105
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:11,789
And so.

106
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:17,504
options continue to exist. I see so many people who

107
00:06:17,504 --> 00:06:21,706
they have a game, they put it out, doesn't really go anywhere and they're like

108
00:06:21,706 --> 00:06:23,006
well I guess that's it

109
00:06:23,006 --> 00:06:26,568
I guess I lose, I guess that's what happened to me but I believe

110
00:06:26,568 --> 00:06:30,149
you can keep injecting life into

111
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:34,951
a game that you know is good. So I'm gonna show you, talk about a couple of

112
00:06:34,951 --> 00:06:37,072
our games for example

113
00:06:37,072 --> 00:06:39,093
that's a little note for me

114
00:06:39,093 --> 00:06:39,193
and

115
00:06:39,193 --> 00:06:39,733
there we are

116
00:06:45,395 --> 00:06:47,017
Okay, so I'm going to play a trailer.

117
00:06:47,017 --> 00:06:52,241
Ooh, a little echoey.

118
00:06:52,241 --> 00:06:54,884
So, um, this is Gunhouse.

119
00:06:54,884 --> 00:06:59,128
Gunhouse is a puzzle tower defense hybrid thing

120
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:03,311
that we first released on PlayStation Mobile in 2014.

121
00:07:03,311 --> 00:07:06,134
Sony paid for the development of that game

122
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,876
because they needed games on PlayStation Mobile at the time.

123
00:07:09,628 --> 00:07:12,128
So then Microsoft needed games on Windows Phone.

124
00:07:12,128 --> 00:07:16,789
So they gave us a grant to bring that game over to Windows Phone,

125
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:21,350
and in the process, we were able to port the game from PlayStation Mobile's

126
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,591
rather obscure SDK over to Unity.

127
00:07:23,591 --> 00:07:26,831
Now that it was in Unity, we could put it wherever we wanted.

128
00:07:26,831 --> 00:07:29,712
And so we were able to do something like,

129
00:07:29,712 --> 00:07:32,332
my programmer needed a new phone,

130
00:07:32,332 --> 00:07:37,033
so I was like, I bet we could get a phone from Amazon if we put...

131
00:07:37,793 --> 00:07:39,274
the game on their platform.

132
00:07:39,274 --> 00:07:41,555
So we did and we got a new phone for him.

133
00:07:41,555 --> 00:07:45,856
And it only took us two weeks.

134
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:50,397
So yeah, and we killed a bunch of bugs in the process as we kept iterating on it and

135
00:07:50,397 --> 00:07:55,179
then we finally self-funded the port to iOS and Android, did a whole bunch more work to

136
00:07:55,179 --> 00:08:01,821
make sure that this was like the best version of this game that we could make at the time.

137
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:04,702
Oh wow, I made it almost to the end of the trailer.

138
00:08:04,702 --> 00:08:06,583
Well too bad, we're going to the next one.

139
00:08:07,443 --> 00:08:10,847
This right here is O'Deer.

140
00:08:10,847 --> 00:08:13,089
Oh, I didn't even maximize it last time, sorry.

141
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:15,091
Um...

142
00:08:15,091 --> 00:08:25,003
Uh, O'Deer is a pseudo-3D driving game about drifting your way to grandmas while hitting or avoiding as many deer as possible.

143
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:31,101
For this one, we also got Sony funding at the beginning for a PlayStation Mobile version,

144
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:33,162
which released in 2015.

145
00:08:33,162 --> 00:08:38,064
But later we pitched Humble on bringing the game to their Humble subscription, and we

146
00:08:38,064 --> 00:08:44,226
released that just a few weeks ago, so our beta is now out for people to buy on Humble.

147
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,693
And so now we're awaiting the final version funding to make this happen.

148
00:08:49,693 --> 00:08:53,016
So one thing that's interesting about both of these games is

149
00:08:53,016 --> 00:08:58,720
the first platform was PlayStation Mobile, which is now a dead platform.

150
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,983
And in a way, this doesn't hurt us because

151
00:09:02,983 --> 00:09:09,208
they can't really compare this game to the one that came before.

152
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,609
Uh, okay, that's done. Goodbye.

153
00:09:13,162 --> 00:09:14,463
Yeah, Dumbo.

154
00:09:14,463 --> 00:09:19,246
So here's some things that are good about this model.

155
00:09:19,246 --> 00:09:22,188
First, you get money to make your own game.

156
00:09:22,188 --> 00:09:26,650
Like, it's rare that you can come

157
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,512
from a place of not being super known,

158
00:09:29,512 --> 00:09:32,274
but be given the opportunity to make

159
00:09:32,274 --> 00:09:36,616
your own game on someone else's money and continue to own that.

160
00:09:36,616 --> 00:09:37,517
So that's great.

161
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,770
You can keep improving it on each platform.

162
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,171
As I said, iteratively make it better.

163
00:09:43,171 --> 00:09:47,092
You're also building expertise at launching games,

164
00:09:47,092 --> 00:09:48,473
which is really important,

165
00:09:48,473 --> 00:09:52,514
because each platform has its idiosyncrasies,

166
00:09:52,514 --> 00:09:56,356
and frankly, even just knowing that is important,

167
00:09:56,356 --> 00:09:58,676
but having gone through the process many times,

168
00:09:58,676 --> 00:10:01,818
going through ESRB rating and PEGI rating,

169
00:10:03,238 --> 00:10:09,840
figuring out what you have to do to get your game released in Portuguese-speaking countries,

170
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,461
which is slightly different, you know?

171
00:10:11,461 --> 00:10:13,821
This stuff is all really important,

172
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:18,183
and it gives you great experience for when you finally do launch it on a big platform,

173
00:10:18,183 --> 00:10:19,923
you're going to be better at it.

174
00:10:23,472 --> 00:10:25,857
It's also better than contract work, because it's yours.

175
00:10:25,857 --> 00:10:28,543
A lot of people do contract work early on

176
00:10:28,543 --> 00:10:31,329
to try to make ends meet,

177
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:33,173
but if you can work on your own thing, that's better.

178
00:10:34,113 --> 00:10:41,295
It also gives you a bunch of games that you can put on different platforms which helps

179
00:10:41,295 --> 00:10:42,736
you with this model.

180
00:10:42,736 --> 00:10:46,757
So we've got a touch screen game and we've got a controller game, controller keyboard

181
00:10:46,757 --> 00:10:47,437
game.

182
00:10:47,437 --> 00:10:50,699
So if a new platform arises that has touch, we can put that on it.

183
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:53,600
If a controller thingy happens, we can put that on it.

184
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:02,007
You can also use funding if you wind up making a game for some obscure technology

185
00:11:02,007 --> 00:11:04,569
that doesn't exist elsewhere.

186
00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:09,414
You can use future funding to port it to a more universal platform.

187
00:11:09,414 --> 00:11:12,538
A lot of releases, having a lot of releases also gives you a lot to talk about.

188
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:14,720
It makes you look more active as a company.

189
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:23,668
And it hasn't harmed us in very many ways because, like I said, when, you know, when

190
00:11:23,668 --> 00:11:30,770
Gunhouse and ODIHR get new versions, very few people actually know that it has existed

191
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,530
on a small platform before because those platforms were small.

192
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:34,651
They never saw them.

193
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:41,797
And then after that you kind of have something really good to show publishers if you want

194
00:11:41,797 --> 00:11:47,082
to get more money because, like to make the final version, because you have built the

195
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:49,504
core of your game and it's there and you can just be like, do you like this?

196
00:11:49,504 --> 00:11:50,165
Here it is.

197
00:11:50,165 --> 00:11:51,086
Wow, look at those tough buddies.

198
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:51,346
Tough as heck.

199
00:11:58,516 --> 00:12:03,199
So here are some things that you need in order to make this model work.

200
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,620
You have to own your own IP.

201
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:10,283
If you don't work that into your deal, then none of it works.

202
00:12:10,283 --> 00:12:13,364
So that's number one.

203
00:12:13,364 --> 00:12:19,588
Obviously it always has to be good, it's stupid to say, but if you half-ass it, it's not going

204
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:20,028
to go anywhere.

205
00:12:21,143 --> 00:12:24,704
And don't expect these platforms to last necessarily.

206
00:12:24,704 --> 00:12:27,145
It doesn't really matter if they do.

207
00:12:27,145 --> 00:12:31,226
What matters is you're getting your game out there.

208
00:12:31,226 --> 00:12:33,607
It also only works if you got a very small team.

209
00:12:33,607 --> 00:12:36,867
$30,000 is good if you're three people.

210
00:12:36,867 --> 00:12:39,728
If you're 10 people, it's basically worthless.

211
00:12:41,609 --> 00:12:45,853
You also need someone on the team who can, like me, spend time thinking about business

212
00:12:45,853 --> 00:12:52,258
and chasing down leads and doing this stuff because otherwise you'll just get overwhelmed

213
00:12:52,258 --> 00:12:57,523
with making the game and not thinking about what's next and how to sell it again.

214
00:12:57,523 --> 00:13:03,348
You also have to be reliable because if you're delivering quality at a good pace, then people

215
00:13:03,348 --> 00:13:06,951
are going to know that and they're going to come back to you and be like, we need another

216
00:13:06,951 --> 00:13:07,191
thing.

217
00:13:08,312 --> 00:13:13,415
And you must plan for not making any additional money on those platforms

218
00:13:13,415 --> 00:13:20,580
because it's going to be a small platform and you make it and then it's not going to be a tower fall

219
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,982
because nothing is going to be a tower fall ever again probably.

220
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,683
This guy, he needs a hug.

221
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:33,470
There's some things that can go wrong with this as well.

222
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,974
You can definitely get some potentially lean times there.

223
00:13:35,974 --> 00:13:40,641
We, like I said, we've survived for five years doing this

224
00:13:40,641 --> 00:13:42,123
and that's great, but.

225
00:13:43,184 --> 00:13:46,706
At the beginning of December of 2016,

226
00:13:46,706 --> 00:13:48,407
we had $200,000 in handshake,

227
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:51,609
definitely gonna do this deals.

228
00:13:51,609 --> 00:13:54,090
It was looking fantastic for 2017.

229
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:57,312
We had it all laid out.

230
00:13:57,312 --> 00:14:02,014
By mid-February, that went down to $0,000, zero K.

231
00:14:02,014 --> 00:14:05,416
That is not enough K to make anything.

232
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:05,456
So.

233
00:14:06,897 --> 00:14:08,078
It's rough.

234
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:12,899
Also, publishers may not understand what you're doing.

235
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:15,340
We have talked to publishers who,

236
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,940
looking at the beta of Odeer,

237
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,721
they're like, why would we fund this?

238
00:14:20,721 --> 00:14:21,061
It's out.

239
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:23,942
It's like, yeah, it's out, but it's not finished.

240
00:14:23,942 --> 00:14:25,283
It's kind of like early access.

241
00:14:25,283 --> 00:14:26,023
We're building it.

242
00:14:26,023 --> 00:14:27,823
But not everybody understands that.

243
00:14:29,063 --> 00:14:31,445
It also takes a lot of work to get this going.

244
00:14:31,445 --> 00:14:35,708
You have to do a lot of legwork to figure out what these platforms are, because sometimes

245
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,751
they are obscure and not everybody knows about them.

246
00:14:39,751 --> 00:14:46,596
It's because not everybody knows about them that you can kind of make this thing work,

247
00:14:46,596 --> 00:14:49,338
but it's a double-edged sword there.

248
00:14:49,338 --> 00:14:50,599
Oh, look who's back.

249
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,840
That's weird.

250
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,302
How do you identify these platforms?

251
00:14:58,271 --> 00:15:03,274
You should look for new platforms that fit what you're already making, first and foremost.

252
00:15:03,274 --> 00:15:04,315
That's the best thing.

253
00:15:04,315 --> 00:15:07,538
And right now, VR is a good place for that.

254
00:15:07,538 --> 00:15:13,622
The VR funny money where they were just dumping barrels of it, that's kind of over.

255
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:18,986
But all the major VR platforms are still funding projects.

256
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:22,309
Not maybe for a huge amount, but they are funding them.

257
00:15:22,309 --> 00:15:24,851
And I believe that even at this stage...

258
00:15:25,331 --> 00:15:29,354
If you're making a VR game, you should not be spending your own money on it.

259
00:15:29,354 --> 00:15:35,199
At least past the prototype phase, you should be getting paid for it by a platform.

260
00:15:36,324 --> 00:15:38,146
Look also for new business models.

261
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:39,327
Subscriptions are cool.

262
00:15:39,327 --> 00:15:40,968
There's some subscription things coming to iOS.

263
00:15:40,968 --> 00:15:44,151
There are already some in other countries.

264
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,133
And bundles are good.

265
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:48,996
The Humble subscription was good for us.

266
00:15:48,996 --> 00:15:52,479
Well, don't do bundles until you're absolutely desperate

267
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:54,081
and out of money, though, by the way,

268
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:58,685
because after that, it really gets devalued

269
00:15:58,685 --> 00:16:00,747
and it's hard to come back and bring it back up.

270
00:16:02,288 --> 00:16:09,494
A new technology that you can easily support is cool, like a new physics thing or a new weird haptics thing.

271
00:16:09,494 --> 00:16:13,917
If you can easily integrate that into your game, they...

272
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:20,501
I mean, you want to talk to them about this first, but they may fund you to have an example of like,

273
00:16:20,501 --> 00:16:24,304
here's our technology working in a video game and it's good.

274
00:16:24,304 --> 00:16:27,807
And then you just put their logo at the front and then you get a bunch of money.

275
00:16:29,582 --> 00:16:32,205
Look for stores in new and emerging markets.

276
00:16:32,205 --> 00:16:34,247
Sometimes this requires localization,

277
00:16:34,247 --> 00:16:36,830
but sometimes they'll do it for you.

278
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,952
If you've ever released a game on Android,

279
00:16:38,952 --> 00:16:41,876
it is highly likely that you have been contacted

280
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,298
by some publisher in China asking

281
00:16:44,298 --> 00:16:47,482
if they can release your game over there.

282
00:16:47,482 --> 00:16:50,005
And if they're legit, give it a try.

283
00:16:52,724 --> 00:16:57,610
I like that chipmunk guy so much that I made a comic about him.

284
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:05,720
So people have been doing some version of this sort of thing for many years.

285
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,784
So think about companies like...

286
00:17:10,165 --> 00:17:16,328
Capcom or SNK or Konami, they have this huge backlog of titles, which most of us don't

287
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:23,292
have, of course, but they're essentially not giving up on their game by saying, okay, we

288
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:29,635
released this game on the Genesis. That's 20 years old. They're putting it on virtual

289
00:17:29,635 --> 00:17:34,818
console and Steam and stuff like this, and they're just continually getting revenue from

290
00:17:34,818 --> 00:17:34,858
it.

291
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,731
The costs are really low on that.

292
00:17:38,731 --> 00:17:41,933
Obviously, most of us can't do that though.

293
00:17:41,933 --> 00:17:44,896
But let's look at Sega as an example.

294
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:48,959
They have done some interesting, weird things.

295
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:54,023
That's Vegeta from Dragon Ball in Streets of Rage 2.

296
00:17:54,023 --> 00:17:57,366
That is an official selling product on Steam

297
00:17:57,366 --> 00:18:00,689
because Sega has opened up their platform,

298
00:18:00,689 --> 00:18:03,711
essentially, to ROM hackers.

299
00:18:05,012 --> 00:18:08,114
On Steam, you can release a ROM hack,

300
00:18:08,114 --> 00:18:09,775
Sega gets some money and you get some money.

301
00:18:09,775 --> 00:18:13,117
It's weird, but they're doing that and it's great.

302
00:18:13,117 --> 00:18:14,798
I was trying to get some more information about this.

303
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:17,840
I couldn't get much, but a representative said to me,

304
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,802
we are keen to offer the back catalog

305
00:18:19,802 --> 00:18:22,363
onto as many relevant platforms as possible

306
00:18:22,363 --> 00:18:24,645
and also embrace all community-created content

307
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,107
where legally viable to do so.

308
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:29,968
Fan-made modified ROMs are hugely appealing

309
00:18:29,968 --> 00:18:31,750
to the PC community in particular.

310
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:36,157
Archiving is therefore taken very seriously so we'll never give up on our games.

311
00:18:37,998 --> 00:18:40,340
Double Fine is another good example.

312
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,442
They kept the PC rights in publisher deals

313
00:18:43,442 --> 00:18:46,044
for Brutal Legend, Costume Quest, and Stacking,

314
00:18:46,044 --> 00:18:47,925
and then eventually they wound up getting

315
00:18:47,925 --> 00:18:51,688
the PC rights back to Psychonauts and Iron Brigade.

316
00:18:51,688 --> 00:18:55,570
They self-funded PC ports of all of those titles,

317
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:58,512
and they have all made them continuous income streams

318
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:01,874
that they've been able to use to partially fund

319
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:04,076
every other game that they've made, pretty much.

320
00:19:06,117 --> 00:19:12,023
These PC releases also allowed them to spin up their publishing division because, like I was saying before,

321
00:19:12,023 --> 00:19:16,807
constant releases give you a lot of experience launching games,

322
00:19:16,807 --> 00:19:25,596
and that's a lot of what a publisher does, is launch your game, talk about it, and put all that stuff out there.

323
00:19:25,596 --> 00:19:28,358
Like, every time you release a game, you get some learning from it.

324
00:19:29,357 --> 00:19:32,763
Then they did remasters of those classic LucasArts games

325
00:19:32,763 --> 00:19:35,086
like Grim Fandango and Day of the Tentacle.

326
00:19:35,086 --> 00:19:37,790
And they broke even for the studio in just a few days

327
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,713
and have both gone on to earn more revenue

328
00:19:39,713 --> 00:19:43,038
than their original versions.

329
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:43,920
But then on the flip side.

330
00:19:44,947 --> 00:19:48,769
Broken Age and Grim Fandango both got Android ports

331
00:19:48,769 --> 00:19:51,470
that were paid for by hardware manufacturers,

332
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:54,591
and that money didn't totally cover the cost of the port,

333
00:19:54,591 --> 00:19:57,473
and then they didn't sell super well

334
00:19:57,473 --> 00:19:58,393
on the Android platform,

335
00:19:58,393 --> 00:20:01,275
so they've basically stopped supporting Android devices.

336
00:20:01,275 --> 00:20:05,797
But if Double Fine were five people

337
00:20:05,797 --> 00:20:08,499
instead of 30 people or whatever they are,

338
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:10,940
those hardware deals might actually have been

339
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,860
really useful for them.

340
00:20:13,709 --> 00:20:21,631
Another kind of my company size example is Adam Ripon from Muteki, who released Dragon

341
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,972
Fantasy, self-funded for iOS first.

342
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,432
Then they got an advance from Sony for Vita and PS3.

343
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:34,734
And then they released the Vita version, like the third revenue stream from this was a thing

344
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,775
called Limited Run, which if you don't know, releases...

345
00:20:38,592 --> 00:20:41,014
boxed versions of Vita and PS4 games.

346
00:20:41,014 --> 00:20:43,516
Because that's something that Sony has set up

347
00:20:43,516 --> 00:20:45,937
that you can do, but Limited Run has like a store

348
00:20:45,937 --> 00:20:46,758
and shop for it.

349
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:51,627
And so when he released the limited run version,

350
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:53,827
it was actually the most lucrative version

351
00:20:53,827 --> 00:20:54,928
that he released.

352
00:20:54,928 --> 00:20:57,428
He said it was roughly one million times

353
00:20:57,428 --> 00:20:59,068
the return of our Steam version.

354
00:20:59,068 --> 00:21:01,349
I might be exaggerating that number, but not by much.

355
00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:04,670
So for him, once the game is done,

356
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,730
he actually thinks that the more highly curated

357
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:09,891
the market is, that is to say closed,

358
00:21:09,891 --> 00:21:12,771
the easier it is for traditionally built games to succeed,

359
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,832
which is genre titles built without Kickstarter funding.

360
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:21,340
So for him, he said each time we did a new release, we aimed for more and more curated

361
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,923
markets.

362
00:21:22,923 --> 00:21:25,729
He also said Android was a waste of time, so sorry, Android.

363
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:30,128
Here's some more advice.

364
00:21:30,128 --> 00:21:33,731
Keep your code base up to date.

365
00:21:33,731 --> 00:21:39,696
We had a big problem when we ported Odir to PC

366
00:21:39,696 --> 00:21:43,860
because the previous coder hadn't documented anything

367
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:48,944
and there's magic numbers in there

368
00:21:48,944 --> 00:21:53,228
and sprites were named with numbers instead of names

369
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,470
and so you had to figure out retroactively.

370
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,671
It was a big archive work.

371
00:21:59,255 --> 00:22:00,302
So don't do that to yourself.

372
00:22:02,056 --> 00:22:07,137
And also don't spend time chasing money that you're not sure will ever exist.

373
00:22:07,137 --> 00:22:10,118
We spent some time trying to get...

374
00:22:10,118 --> 00:22:13,399
I was really thinking we could get one of those Unreal grants that they were giving

375
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:14,599
out a while ago.

376
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:21,700
But the thing we were making was 2D and it wasn't really the kind of thing that they

377
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:29,962
were signing and we wound up spending like a month and a half trying to put a square

378
00:22:29,962 --> 00:22:31,283
peg in a round hole sort of thing.

379
00:22:32,563 --> 00:22:36,825
So don't, but I mean, do chase award shows,

380
00:22:36,825 --> 00:22:40,526
but not grants, unless they're easy.

381
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:44,988
Keep up relationships with publishers.

382
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:49,029
We continually talk to publishers all the time,

383
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:49,949
even if they're sick of us,

384
00:22:49,949 --> 00:22:52,130
even if they've seen our things already,

385
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,611
because just having, continuing those relationships,

386
00:22:54,611 --> 00:22:57,652
eventually maybe they're gonna want something from you.

387
00:22:58,112 --> 00:23:02,937
and don't just give up because they don't like what you're doing right now.

388
00:23:02,937 --> 00:23:08,102
And then, you know, selling your game is still going to be super hard.

389
00:23:08,102 --> 00:23:13,708
I mean, streamers are tougher than ever to get hold of

390
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:19,353
and they're also, oh look at that, they're also way more important than ever before.

391
00:23:21,784 --> 00:23:23,506
I'm just going to get my slide back.

392
00:23:23,506 --> 00:23:23,726
Yeah, cool.

393
00:23:23,726 --> 00:23:24,386
I'm good at this.

394
00:23:24,386 --> 00:23:33,595
Yeah, we spent actually a lot of time

395
00:23:33,595 --> 00:23:37,458
trying to get streamers to talk about Odir.

396
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:42,623
And we mailed 25 people, and of them,

397
00:23:42,623 --> 00:23:44,945
one replied with a maybe we'll look at it.

398
00:23:44,945 --> 00:23:45,865
Maybe we'll look at it.

399
00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:48,948
I found people respond better on Twitter.

400
00:23:48,948 --> 00:23:50,490
I'm not sure that's true across the board,

401
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:55,454
but one little trick that I've been using lately for that

402
00:23:55,454 --> 00:23:57,256
is I ask my friends on Twitter,

403
00:23:57,256 --> 00:24:00,739
like, who would you like to see stream this game?

404
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:04,183
And then my friends wind up adding a streamer

405
00:24:04,183 --> 00:24:05,964
and being like, this person.

406
00:24:05,964 --> 00:24:06,645
And so then I reply,

407
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:09,207
and then we're already two replies deep into a conversation

408
00:24:09,207 --> 00:24:12,090
and it's more likely to actually pop up on their feed.

409
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:16,752
And just as a final word, I called the platforms suckers.

410
00:24:16,752 --> 00:24:17,753
They're not really suckers.

411
00:24:17,753 --> 00:24:20,854
They need a thing that you can provide to them.

412
00:24:20,854 --> 00:24:23,636
And they're paying you for a reason.

413
00:24:23,636 --> 00:24:25,657
And if you're making original games

414
00:24:25,657 --> 00:24:27,517
that people like in the process,

415
00:24:27,517 --> 00:24:29,378
like what could be better than that?

416
00:24:29,378 --> 00:24:31,019
So thanks, and if you have any questions,

417
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:32,360
please come up to the mic.

418
00:24:42,152 --> 00:24:43,834
Hi, thanks for the talk.

419
00:24:43,834 --> 00:24:49,802
I have a question about when you're putting a pitch deck together and you're doing this

420
00:24:49,802 --> 00:24:54,848
multi-platform targeting, how do you make considerations for that and change it up?

421
00:24:56,385 --> 00:25:04,310
When I'm doing a pitch, I do target it for that platform.

422
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:07,492
If I know that I'm pitching a new platform,

423
00:25:07,492 --> 00:25:11,475
I'm probably not gonna include how much it's gonna cost

424
00:25:11,475 --> 00:25:13,897
because I know that they're just gonna give me

425
00:25:13,897 --> 00:25:17,820
this smallish chunk of money and I know that that's there.

426
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,880
But then I, of course, change it

427
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,042
when I'm going to talk to a publisher

428
00:25:21,042 --> 00:25:23,664
and I'm like, we need $100,000 to finish this.

429
00:25:25,305 --> 00:25:28,506
And just as a little piece of advice,

430
00:25:28,506 --> 00:25:31,568
definitely overestimate how much you need,

431
00:25:31,568 --> 00:25:34,849
because I have underestimated it so many times,

432
00:25:34,849 --> 00:25:37,410
just so many times, and I keep thinking,

433
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,971
this time, this time I'm gonna do it.

434
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:41,352
But then you get publishers being like,

435
00:25:41,352 --> 00:25:42,592
oh, that's a little too much money,

436
00:25:42,592 --> 00:25:44,453
I don't know about that.

437
00:25:44,453 --> 00:25:48,015
And then you want to bring that cost down,

438
00:25:48,015 --> 00:25:50,716
and then it can wind up screwing you.

439
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:53,397
I don't know if that answered enough of your question, but.

440
00:25:53,397 --> 00:25:54,058
Yeah, thanks.

441
00:25:54,058 --> 00:25:54,438
Okay, thanks.

442
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,802
Over there.

443
00:25:56,802 --> 00:26:01,669
Hey, I just wanted to know, when you got started and you got started with your team, how did

444
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:06,676
you guys decide what you were going to do first and then assign roles and basically

445
00:26:06,676 --> 00:26:10,221
go through your iterative design process until you felt satisfied?

446
00:26:10,413 --> 00:26:16,536
Oh yeah, well it was a little easier for me to start that process because I am not a coder

447
00:26:16,536 --> 00:26:21,960
and I'm not an artist, so who was I going to be but the design, biz, production person?

448
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:28,224
And so that meant that I was naturally going to be defining the roles of the team.

449
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:31,125
But in general I find that a really...

450
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:36,369
For me anyway, if you can find someone who's good at a thing,

451
00:26:36,369 --> 00:26:37,990
and you let them do that thing,

452
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,892
but you also keep them in the loop

453
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:41,753
on all of these decisions,

454
00:26:41,753 --> 00:26:43,555
you're transparent about like,

455
00:26:43,555 --> 00:26:45,597
you make this money off of this deal,

456
00:26:45,597 --> 00:26:47,578
I make this money off of this deal,

457
00:26:47,578 --> 00:26:49,179
here's how much revenue share split

458
00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:51,041
we're gonna have after this,

459
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:53,403
and this is what the actual amount of money is

460
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:54,323
that's coming in.

461
00:26:55,204 --> 00:26:59,752
I think transparency is really good and just keep talking about it with your teammates

462
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:04,961
because they may have ideas you didn't think of.

463
00:27:04,961 --> 00:27:07,165
So I don't know if I went on a tangent, but that's...

464
00:27:08,222 --> 00:27:14,485
Okay, so how much of the non-design work did you have to do and then how did you keep your

465
00:27:14,485 --> 00:27:18,746
teammates around even though you guys weren't generating any revenue at the time?

466
00:27:18,746 --> 00:27:27,209
Right, so I did, I would say that about half of my work is not design.

467
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:31,073
And it obviously fluctuates.

468
00:27:31,073 --> 00:27:35,417
Like when Odir needs to get done I'm like making tracks and that's all I'm doing.

469
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:41,003
But in between those times I'm doing a lot of biz stuff.

470
00:27:41,003 --> 00:27:47,110
And basically I always make sure that I have some money in the bank.

471
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,631
first, and that can be really hard to do.

472
00:27:50,631 --> 00:27:57,573
I got it by just, when I left my old job, I didn't ever claim vacation days, and in

473
00:27:57,573 --> 00:28:03,315
California they have to give you that money back, and so I got like, I started with that.

474
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:06,335
But sorry, I am out of time.

475
00:28:06,335 --> 00:28:11,537
If you want to talk to me, you can get at me here, my email's on my website, or I can

476
00:28:11,537 --> 00:28:13,877
go to the, I'll go outside, or to the wrap up room.

477
00:28:13,877 --> 00:28:13,997
Bye.
