1
00:00:05,448 --> 00:00:06,329
My name is Christopher King.

2
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:08,751
Over the last couple of years, I made a game called 20XX,

3
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:09,712
which we'll talk about in a bit.

4
00:00:10,672 --> 00:00:14,035
We were in early access for a really long time on 20XX,

5
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:15,356
for about two and a half years.

6
00:00:16,337 --> 00:00:17,958
This is a talk about community building

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,239
and how to leverage your community

8
00:00:19,259 --> 00:00:20,260
during your game's development,

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,541
specifically during access,

10
00:00:21,581 --> 00:00:23,622
but I think the lessons kind of apply outside of that too.

11
00:00:24,403 --> 00:00:25,784
We're gonna talk about how to build goodwill

12
00:00:25,824 --> 00:00:27,485
and build trust in your early access community,

13
00:00:27,505 --> 00:00:29,246
and then use that to make your game better.

14
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:31,028
So let's dive right into it

15
00:00:31,088 --> 00:00:32,349
with a couple of quick facts about 20XX.

16
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:36,273
20XX is a co-op action platformer.

17
00:00:36,674 --> 00:00:40,599
It's very heavily inspired by Mega Man X, so the very similar kind of old-school action

18
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:43,903
platforming gameplay, but it's multiplayer, so you can play it online or on the couch,

19
00:00:44,204 --> 00:00:48,289
and it's a roguelike, so it features high arcade-style replayability through random

20
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:51,834
game generation and permanent death, and it's out on every current generation platform.

21
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,722
On day one of Early Access, we sold a whopping 64 copies of 20XX.

22
00:00:58,182 --> 00:00:59,363
I was very thrilled by this.

23
00:00:59,763 --> 00:01:00,924
I thought this was outstanding.

24
00:01:01,344 --> 00:01:06,607
The idea that, for this first game I had made, that 64 whole people were like, yeah, I think

25
00:01:06,687 --> 00:01:09,808
I can pay my money for this thing that you've made was outstanding.

26
00:01:09,948 --> 00:01:12,210
Obviously, in hindsight, that was kind of terrible.

27
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,511
and counts as a bit of a slow launch.

28
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:18,032
And here today, we are gonna talk about one of the factors

29
00:01:18,433 --> 00:01:22,175
that got us towards selling over 220,000 copies of 20XX

30
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:23,015
as of today.

31
00:01:23,735 --> 00:01:26,016
An awful lot of factors contributed to our success,

32
00:01:26,157 --> 00:01:27,817
but we're here today to really dig into one of them,

33
00:01:27,877 --> 00:01:29,678
which is our community management strategies.

34
00:01:31,773 --> 00:01:32,454
Just a quick outline.

35
00:01:32,594 --> 00:01:35,116
I'm not going to dig into too much here but there's going to be a brief introduction.

36
00:01:35,697 --> 00:01:39,901
I'm going to hit on these six points about specific things we did with our community

37
00:01:39,961 --> 00:01:44,465
to either build goodwill, build trust, build loyalty or use it to get better feedback.

38
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:48,188
And in the event that I haven't run out of time, I'm going to take a couple questions.

39
00:01:48,468 --> 00:01:50,090
So let's get into it.

40
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:51,471
What is this talk?

41
00:01:51,931 --> 00:01:56,914
When you properly nurture your early access community, you can get a fantastic source

42
00:01:57,154 --> 00:01:58,454
of design feedback and testing.

43
00:01:59,055 --> 00:02:02,456
If you treat your fans right, they will treat you better and help you make a better game

44
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:03,497
and they will love doing it.

45
00:02:04,177 --> 00:02:08,720
So today's goal is actionable second level information about how to build community goodwill

46
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,440
and use it effectively.

47
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,303
And when I say second level information, I'm referring to actionable stuff that's one level

48
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:16,324
of detail past what's blatantly obvious.

49
00:02:16,624 --> 00:02:18,285
Hopefully stuff you can go ahead and use today.

50
00:02:20,112 --> 00:02:23,173
First things first though, before we get into the meat of this talk, it's point zero, it's

51
00:02:23,213 --> 00:02:23,873
not one through six.

52
00:02:24,633 --> 00:02:26,054
Early access is not free.

53
00:02:26,454 --> 00:02:28,675
This is a chart of my time spent on 20XX.

54
00:02:29,355 --> 00:02:32,916
That's 17% in the middle is my time spent managing our early access community.

55
00:02:33,636 --> 00:02:39,678
Over our 142 weeks in early access, that's two and three quarters years or so, I spent

56
00:02:39,718 --> 00:02:42,019
about eight hours a week interacting with our community.

57
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:47,681
And as our game's primary designer, creative, tech guy, level designer, all that stuff.

58
00:02:48,341 --> 00:02:50,103
That's a very, very large cost.

59
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:53,105
It's about 28 full-time weeks or seven full-time months

60
00:02:53,165 --> 00:02:53,946
of community management.

61
00:02:54,526 --> 00:02:56,768
And if you're not interested in really integrating

62
00:02:56,808 --> 00:02:59,030
player feedback into your game or helping your players

63
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,732
help you design your game, this is a huge cost.

64
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:03,654
And you obviously have to account for this.

65
00:03:03,774 --> 00:03:05,335
If you just assume that community management

66
00:03:05,415 --> 00:03:07,197
is free or effortless or doesn't take any time,

67
00:03:07,757 --> 00:03:09,258
you're gonna be real disappointed.

68
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,851
So one, establish a schedule and keep your word.

69
00:03:13,131 --> 00:03:14,431
This section is about loyalty building.

70
00:03:15,051 --> 00:03:18,072
As a developer, you want to build loyalty because it increases your player retention,

71
00:03:18,452 --> 00:03:22,154
it makes your players more likely to give you better, more detailed feedback, it engenders

72
00:03:22,334 --> 00:03:26,715
kinder communities, and I really can't overstate how nice it is to have people not be dicks

73
00:03:26,735 --> 00:03:31,057
to you over the internet, especially when Steam communities can be very toxic places

74
00:03:31,117 --> 00:03:32,117
and thankfully ours was not.

75
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:36,285
and it makes players more likely to be your fans going forward.

76
00:03:36,305 --> 00:03:37,547
So when you work on more projects,

77
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,410
the people who have played your games before

78
00:03:39,471 --> 00:03:41,614
will remember your positive interactions and be like,

79
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,880
oh, I kind of have some basic default trust with that guy.

80
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,761
I'm going to check that out.

81
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,492
So first thing, set an update schedule and stick to it.

82
00:03:49,532 --> 00:03:50,633
This is a very concrete thing.

83
00:03:50,653 --> 00:03:56,637
On 20XX we updated the game every other Wednesday at 6pm Eastern throughout our 142 weeks on

84
00:03:56,657 --> 00:03:57,318
early access.

85
00:03:57,338 --> 00:04:00,020
So that's 72 bi-weekly updates.

86
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,621
They were very, very, very on time.

87
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:05,564
One of them was off by a single hour, one of them was off by a day, and the other 70

88
00:04:05,924 --> 00:04:06,845
were smack on time.

89
00:04:07,826 --> 00:04:11,148
And it really builds a sense of reliability in your fan base.

90
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:14,030
Even if you don't have a lot of players immediately,

91
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,993
the players you do have will come to rely on the schedule that you've set

92
00:04:18,053 --> 00:04:19,374
and they'll plan play sessions.

93
00:04:19,414 --> 00:04:22,196
Like 20XX has two-player online multiplayer,

94
00:04:22,236 --> 00:04:25,038
so we'd have people, like, organizing sessions with their friends.

95
00:04:25,058 --> 00:04:27,279
Oh, we're going to play at 6.05 on Wednesday

96
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,421
because I am confident that the game will have updated

97
00:04:29,461 --> 00:04:30,582
and we can rely on that plan.

98
00:04:31,683 --> 00:04:33,765
and it really builds a lot of loyalty in your fans

99
00:04:33,785 --> 00:04:35,446
when they know exactly when they can come back

100
00:04:35,486 --> 00:04:36,447
and see the cool new stuff.

101
00:04:37,148 --> 00:04:39,670
And if you take absolutely nothing else from this talk,

102
00:04:40,892 --> 00:04:42,873
take that, add an update timer to your main menu.

103
00:04:43,214 --> 00:04:44,275
Here is an example of that.

104
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,837
So this is a picture of 20XX's main menu

105
00:04:46,877 --> 00:04:47,878
at one point during development.

106
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:53,881
You can see that very professionally drawn green circle around next update in and then a timer

107
00:04:54,702 --> 00:04:57,343
Very simple just look at the time that you're going to update

108
00:04:57,543 --> 00:05:00,865
Compute the difference between now and then and put it right on your right on your front page

109
00:05:01,845 --> 00:05:05,627
Much harder than this is actually adhering to your schedule. You know sometimes

110
00:05:06,187 --> 00:05:08,829
You're going to have to make cuts to features you intended to push on time.

111
00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:13,791
Being reliable here is important, and it's much better to release a small update now

112
00:05:13,851 --> 00:05:18,034
and then than be late, and it's much better to not set a schedule at all than set a schedule

113
00:05:18,054 --> 00:05:19,714
that you reliably cannot adhere to.

114
00:05:20,355 --> 00:05:21,896
If you're going to do this, make sure you actually can.

115
00:05:22,796 --> 00:05:26,839
And finally on this, make sure that the time you set is life-friendly for you.

116
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,280
This is actually a mistake we made on 20XX.

117
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:34,563
I set our update timer at 6pm Eastern every other Wednesday, and I lived on the East Coast,

118
00:05:35,404 --> 00:05:38,686
so we would be pushing regular patches right before I was supposed to either go out to

119
00:05:38,726 --> 00:05:43,088
dinner or go to an evening social thing or do something right after I was off of work,

120
00:05:43,148 --> 00:05:43,308
right?

121
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:46,991
And instead, because of my very poorly chosen timer time...

122
00:05:48,072 --> 00:05:52,356
I would very frequently either have to push a patch and then just leave and not bring

123
00:05:52,396 --> 00:05:56,099
a computer and potentially have crashes or other bad bugs in the live build for a few

124
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:59,843
hours or I'd have to cancel going out or I'd be like, hey friends, I brought my laptop

125
00:05:59,863 --> 00:06:00,844
because also I have to work.

126
00:06:02,025 --> 00:06:04,747
Pick a good time, preferably right in the middle of your workday.

127
00:06:04,828 --> 00:06:08,931
If we had done 2pm instead of 6pm, we would have been much better off and we will do that

128
00:06:08,972 --> 00:06:09,472
going forward.

129
00:06:10,831 --> 00:06:15,175
Lastly, on this guy, never promise anything unless you're 100% sure it's going to happen.

130
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:19,599
I'm sure you guys can think of more than one game community that's been kind of ticked

131
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:25,585
off by a developer making lofty promises or specific, or promising specific release dates

132
00:06:25,605 --> 00:06:28,347
for features pretty far in advance and then letting their community down.

133
00:06:29,068 --> 00:06:30,850
And this is really just about, oopsie.

134
00:06:31,676 --> 00:06:31,956
One back.

135
00:06:32,857 --> 00:06:34,558
This is really about expectation management.

136
00:06:35,278 --> 00:06:37,079
Announcing features too early really doesn't win you a lot,

137
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:38,920
especially when you're on a slow launch

138
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,041
or a relatively small team

139
00:06:40,081 --> 00:06:41,342
and don't have a huge player base.

140
00:06:41,982 --> 00:06:44,143
And it risks eroding community faith and trust

141
00:06:44,183 --> 00:06:44,964
if those dates slip.

142
00:06:45,744 --> 00:06:47,525
When you do tell your fans what you're working on,

143
00:06:47,745 --> 00:06:48,486
pick better language.

144
00:06:49,046 --> 00:06:51,067
Instead of saying feature X is gonna be available

145
00:06:51,087 --> 00:06:54,149
on date Y, say we are actively working on feature X,

146
00:06:54,249 --> 00:06:56,451
say feature X is really high priority for us,

147
00:06:56,871 --> 00:06:58,012
and then don't announce a ship date

148
00:06:58,032 --> 00:06:59,913
until it is tested and ready to go.

149
00:07:02,774 --> 00:07:05,276
Oh, actually, lastly, on this guy, be open about your mistakes.

150
00:07:06,097 --> 00:07:10,540
In a lot of cases, making a mistake, admitting it, and then fixing it leaves you with a lot

151
00:07:10,561 --> 00:07:12,022
more goodwill than just trying to cover it up.

152
00:07:12,782 --> 00:07:18,667
If you goof in a publicly visible way, admit it, say, we goofed, our bad, explain how you

153
00:07:18,687 --> 00:07:19,188
plan to fix it.

154
00:07:19,848 --> 00:07:21,109
This is a high priority fix for us.

155
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,370
We understand there's a crash in the game.

156
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,251
We're working on it right now.

157
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:25,232
If you can't fix it, explain why.

158
00:07:25,573 --> 00:07:27,394
This is a relatively small issue

159
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:29,476
and we've got a lot of hotter irons in the fire.

160
00:07:30,056 --> 00:07:32,638
We're gonna take care of it at this point-ish down the line.

161
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:34,740
But of course, note the publicly visible part.

162
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,681
There's no reason that you have to

163
00:07:37,162 --> 00:07:38,943
sort of make up fake mistakes

164
00:07:39,163 --> 00:07:40,985
or mistakes that nobody has noticed

165
00:07:41,025 --> 00:07:42,206
because they're relatively invisible.

166
00:07:42,246 --> 00:07:43,326
You don't need to tell anybody

167
00:07:43,386 --> 00:07:44,607
that you did those sorts of things.

168
00:07:45,606 --> 00:07:47,209
When you patch a crash out, announce it.

169
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,212
When you fix a balance issue, announce it.

170
00:07:49,413 --> 00:07:50,234
Pretty straightforward stuff.

171
00:07:50,915 --> 00:07:52,137
It's not some kind of life hack.

172
00:07:52,177 --> 00:07:53,579
People just like honest developers.

173
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,207
A lot of developers don't seem terribly human in the way they interact with their fan bases.

174
00:07:58,828 --> 00:08:00,250
When you can appear human, it's nice for you.

175
00:08:01,472 --> 00:08:04,153
Two, maintain an active, visible relationship.

176
00:08:04,394 --> 00:08:05,674
This section is about making sure

177
00:08:06,034 --> 00:08:07,715
that your presence and your actions are known

178
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:08,736
and felt in your community.

179
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,097
When you make changes, nope, that's one slide too many.

180
00:08:12,898 --> 00:08:15,019
When you make changes that players have suggested,

181
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:15,859
do so very visibly.

182
00:08:16,219 --> 00:08:18,220
Call them out in your patch notes, post in the forums.

183
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,581
Like if there's a Steam community post

184
00:08:19,601 --> 00:08:20,802
where you got a really good suggestion,

185
00:08:21,182 --> 00:08:22,182
post after you've made it.

186
00:08:22,242 --> 00:08:23,503
Post when it's made it to the backlog

187
00:08:23,543 --> 00:08:25,564
and say, hey, this is a fantastic idea, thank you.

188
00:08:26,284 --> 00:08:32,225
closing that loop with a player and making sure that they're aware that their awesome suggestion actually resonated with you

189
00:08:32,665 --> 00:08:35,086
makes them a lot more likely to give you stuff like that in the future.

190
00:08:36,106 --> 00:08:42,267
Similarly, take advantage of low-hanging fruit here. If a user suggests something to you that is already in your backlog,

191
00:08:42,967 --> 00:08:46,988
so it's not actually a new suggestion, feel free to say that's fantastic. It's in our backlog anyway.

192
00:08:49,168 --> 00:08:53,309
Keep early access sexy. Armstrong gets a fade transition. It's the only one.

193
00:08:54,657 --> 00:08:56,098
Be ready to shuffle around your backlog.

194
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,701
Be ready to shuffle around your backlog?

195
00:08:58,841 --> 00:08:59,262
Yeah, sure.

196
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:01,862
Yeah, be ready to shuffle around your backlog.

197
00:09:02,603 --> 00:09:05,485
Once you're developing your game in front of what's basically a live studio audience,

198
00:09:05,765 --> 00:09:09,368
you suddenly have a major priority that you weren't dealing with before,

199
00:09:09,388 --> 00:09:13,531
the immediate now customer experience, and your backlog has to take that into account.

200
00:09:14,251 --> 00:09:16,653
You're going to have to address player pain points sooner than you intended.

201
00:09:16,713 --> 00:09:19,695
If you know there's like a really bad quality of life issue in your game,

202
00:09:20,055 --> 00:09:22,837
or if you know there's an awful crash, you're going to have to come back and

203
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:24,578
fix those things earlier than you intended.

204
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:27,681
And you need to be aware that whatever your regular development process was,

205
00:09:28,181 --> 00:09:31,464
isn't going to be exactly that way once you also have a whole bunch of users

206
00:09:31,884 --> 00:09:34,366
like telling you about their experience on a day-to-day basis.

207
00:09:35,046 --> 00:09:37,768
Similarly, you might want to ration out exciting things you're working on

208
00:09:38,189 --> 00:09:41,711
if you have a whole lot at once. Like for example, maybe you have 10 new levels

209
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:45,514
that you're ready to drop, two new modes, and you know that the next month of early

210
00:09:45,594 --> 00:09:49,997
access is a pretty dry time. Consider putting the modes in one patch

211
00:09:50,038 --> 00:09:52,720
and then one mode in another patch and then the other mode in the third patch

212
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,662
so that your users coming back always have something exciting about your

213
00:09:56,823 --> 00:09:57,543
constant updating.

214
00:09:58,404 --> 00:10:01,386
Finally, though, don't ration bug fixes.

215
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:02,567
Don't do that.

216
00:10:03,087 --> 00:10:06,130
Basically, if the thing you're working on, the rule of thumb, if the thing you're working

217
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:10,813
on is a detrimental to player experience kind of thing, don't ration that out.

218
00:10:10,853 --> 00:10:11,754
Fix it as soon as you can.

219
00:10:12,274 --> 00:10:13,315
Hot fix it if you have to.

220
00:10:13,355 --> 00:10:14,416
Don't wait for a patch cycle.

221
00:10:14,796 --> 00:10:18,639
Make sure that anything that might be turning your users off that is an unintended part

222
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:19,860
of the experience gets out right away.

223
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:20,821
Never ration that.

224
00:10:22,945 --> 00:10:25,445
As an aside, here's a quick example of our community

225
00:10:25,485 --> 00:10:27,026
forcing us to shuffle around our backlog.

226
00:10:27,606 --> 00:10:30,106
So it's August of 2015, we're getting ready for PAX West,

227
00:10:30,706 --> 00:10:34,087
and a major competitor of ours screws the pooch big time

228
00:10:34,527 --> 00:10:35,948
and gives us a press opportunity.

229
00:10:35,988 --> 00:10:38,508
This is another game pretty heavily inspired by Mega Man

230
00:10:38,528 --> 00:10:39,609
that had built a big hype wave

231
00:10:40,109 --> 00:10:42,609
and ended up kind of disappointing their fan base.

232
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:44,850
And they gave us a press opportunity.

233
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,250
So we got together and we said,

234
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,431
okay, what do we have, what do we have that's ready?

235
00:10:48,851 --> 00:10:51,131
If we wanna sort of set an announcement,

236
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,351
if we wanna set a milestone.

237
00:10:53,112 --> 00:10:55,113
what can we put in this milestone to be kind of major?

238
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:58,135
And we said, okay, we've got a couple character redesigns.

239
00:10:58,295 --> 00:11:00,657
If you guys have followed the development of 20xx at all,

240
00:11:00,697 --> 00:11:02,258
you know that we changed the art,

241
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:04,500
we iterated on the art style numerous times.

242
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,661
I think we had six different main character designs

243
00:11:06,741 --> 00:11:08,683
between the very first Steam launch

244
00:11:08,783 --> 00:11:10,344
and 1.0 a couple years later.

245
00:11:10,944 --> 00:11:12,505
So we said, okay, we've got these new character designs

246
00:11:12,525 --> 00:11:13,386
we're really excited about.

247
00:11:13,426 --> 00:11:14,487
We've got a couple of new modes.

248
00:11:14,527 --> 00:11:15,467
We can throw all that in there.

249
00:11:15,487 --> 00:11:15,888
That'll be great.

250
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:16,388
That's perfect.

251
00:11:16,428 --> 00:11:16,948
Let's go with that.

252
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:20,150
So 11 days before this big beta launch,

253
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,031
which was sort of the day that our competitor

254
00:11:22,071 --> 00:11:23,552
was supposed to have had a major event,

255
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,214
we pushed that stuff to our Steam community first,

256
00:11:26,234 --> 00:11:27,655
to our early access users to say,

257
00:11:27,935 --> 00:11:29,476
hey, can you guys gut check this for us?

258
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,677
Let us know if anything here is super broken

259
00:11:31,717 --> 00:11:34,198
or if there are any immediate feedback bits you have

260
00:11:34,238 --> 00:11:34,899
or anything like that.

261
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,381
And this was our response.

262
00:11:39,922 --> 00:11:41,222
These are a little bit cherry picked,

263
00:11:41,282 --> 00:11:42,583
but this was pretty much the response

264
00:11:42,623 --> 00:11:43,824
of our entire Steam community.

265
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:49,154
It was overwhelmingly the most negative feedback we've gotten about anything at all we've done with 20XX.

266
00:11:49,454 --> 00:11:53,255
We're 11 days before our biggest press push of the entire development cycle,

267
00:11:53,895 --> 00:11:55,595
and we're getting this about our main character.

268
00:11:56,536 --> 00:12:00,156
So we scramble to fix it. We cancel a vacation, we build new character models

269
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:04,277
using a lot of the lessons that we learned from the sort of failed character designs we had.

270
00:12:05,117 --> 00:12:08,138
And of course our characters feature very prominently in all of our promotional media.

271
00:12:08,158 --> 00:12:09,738
They're in our trailers, they're in our screenshots.

272
00:12:10,392 --> 00:12:14,836
So a couple of days before this major event, we have to remake all of our trailers and

273
00:12:14,856 --> 00:12:15,577
all of our screenshots.

274
00:12:15,998 --> 00:12:18,000
And we end up doing all of this.

275
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,861
We loop in the community with every single step.

276
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:26,568
The moment it is clear that we have something approaching outrage on our hands, we say,

277
00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:28,070
We goofed.

278
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,411
We're working on this.

279
00:12:29,611 --> 00:12:30,672
You know, please bear with us.

280
00:12:30,913 --> 00:12:31,433
Trust in us.

281
00:12:31,613 --> 00:12:32,334
We're going to work on this.

282
00:12:32,775 --> 00:12:35,117
And every single day we would post our new concepts.

283
00:12:35,157 --> 00:12:36,458
We would post models in progress.

284
00:12:36,478 --> 00:12:37,399
We would post animations.

285
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:42,585
We would basically just show our entire community day by day, this is the new stuff we're building.

286
00:12:43,226 --> 00:12:45,388
does this fit your expectations better?

287
00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:47,431
And if we hadn't done this,

288
00:12:48,051 --> 00:12:50,094
we would have just gotten toasted, honestly.

289
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:51,836
This was a really big press push for us.

290
00:12:52,236 --> 00:12:53,998
There's a really solid chance that if we had pushed

291
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:56,541
that beta with unappealing main character designs

292
00:12:56,581 --> 00:12:58,003
that we just would have been dead in the water right there.

293
00:12:58,424 --> 00:13:00,646
Like this moment is one of the major sparks

294
00:13:00,826 --> 00:13:03,389
that made us successful, and we almost wasted it.

295
00:13:04,582 --> 00:13:06,663
This was some of the feedback we got after having done this.

296
00:13:07,363 --> 00:13:10,384
So keep in mind that these were community members who were downright pissed.

297
00:13:11,044 --> 00:13:15,186
We had turned their beloved characters into something they found so hideous that they

298
00:13:15,206 --> 00:13:15,987
couldn't even play with.

299
00:13:16,027 --> 00:13:17,847
They didn't want to look at these characters while playing the game.

300
00:13:18,388 --> 00:13:22,589
And even though we had made a mistake of that magnitude, once we sat down with them and

301
00:13:22,609 --> 00:13:24,330
we fixed it, they loved us.

302
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,331
And we got a lot of this.

303
00:13:25,391 --> 00:13:28,932
We got a lot of, I can't believe you guys were willing to go that far for us.

304
00:13:28,992 --> 00:13:30,453
Like, thank you for listening to us.

305
00:13:30,473 --> 00:13:32,254
And we're like, thank you for telling us.

306
00:13:32,734 --> 00:13:33,314
We need that stuff.

307
00:13:35,304 --> 00:13:37,445
Three, develop and maintain a group of super friends.

308
00:13:37,765 --> 00:13:39,666
These are early, early access players,

309
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:42,048
they're sort of a side group from your basic EA community

310
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:43,909
that you're gonna use to test content

311
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:45,590
that isn't ready for your entire user base.

312
00:13:46,731 --> 00:13:48,852
They're gonna get to see cool new content

313
00:13:48,893 --> 00:13:49,873
before it's ready for release,

314
00:13:49,953 --> 00:13:52,095
or maybe it's work in progress or experimental stuff.

315
00:13:52,615 --> 00:13:54,456
And you're gonna get last line of defense QA

316
00:13:54,496 --> 00:13:55,457
before stuff goes live,

317
00:13:55,677 --> 00:13:57,278
you're gonna get an awesome source of feedback

318
00:13:57,658 --> 00:13:59,499
before you're really ready to show

319
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,561
your greater player base something you're working on.

320
00:14:02,221 --> 00:14:03,983
Feel free to handle membership in this group, however you like.

321
00:14:04,423 --> 00:14:07,486
You can opt in, you can have people send you a nice email or say I like your video game

322
00:14:07,506 --> 00:14:07,986
that you're making.

323
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:12,731
You can just have it be invite only if you have a big enough community that you can afford

324
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:13,211
to cherry pick.

325
00:14:13,671 --> 00:14:16,474
As long as you're getting the feedback you need, the way you handle membership, the size

326
00:14:16,494 --> 00:14:17,315
of your group doesn't really matter.

327
00:14:18,785 --> 00:14:20,426
Set your group's expectations accordingly.

328
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:25,589
If your superfriend's content is going to be full of garbage or pushed relatively infrequently,

329
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:27,730
it's very important that your fans know that.

330
00:14:28,731 --> 00:14:32,974
You can afford to push less frequently or less consistently.

331
00:14:33,194 --> 00:14:35,275
You can afford to push relatively lower quality stuff.

332
00:14:35,655 --> 00:14:38,357
As long as the people you are pushing to understand that that's what you're doing.

333
00:14:39,137 --> 00:14:43,780
If they are expecting the same level of quality in your regular releases and then you push

334
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,762
them kind of garbagey stuff, they're going to feel bad about it.

335
00:14:47,956 --> 00:14:49,556
Respect the shared value relationship here.

336
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:52,638
Remember that your super friends are a two-way street.

337
00:14:52,978 --> 00:14:54,719
You're getting something really valuable out of them

338
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,601
because you're getting sort of an earlier line of feedback,

339
00:14:57,641 --> 00:14:59,002
you're getting awesome testing from them,

340
00:14:59,102 --> 00:15:00,783
and they're getting to see a lot of cool new stuff

341
00:15:00,803 --> 00:15:02,424
that you haven't actually pushed yet before it's ready.

342
00:15:03,204 --> 00:15:06,126
Accordingly, don't push super friends content

343
00:15:06,146 --> 00:15:08,407
that are only full of relatively boring stuff.

344
00:15:08,768 --> 00:15:10,669
If you have performance enhancements,

345
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:11,809
if you have engine changes,

346
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:14,051
if you have things that are not really impactful

347
00:15:14,071 --> 00:15:16,652
to the average user experience, like content, really.

348
00:15:17,436 --> 00:15:19,017
Don't push these things to super friends,

349
00:15:19,057 --> 00:15:20,157
at least don't push them alone.

350
00:15:20,817 --> 00:15:21,978
If you have to test this stuff,

351
00:15:22,058 --> 00:15:23,078
maybe you have engine changes

352
00:15:23,118 --> 00:15:24,138
that you're really excited about

353
00:15:24,198 --> 00:15:26,379
or you have optimizations you've written in

354
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:28,000
that you're not sure are safe

355
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,400
because they might break other things

356
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,681
that you can't really test on your own.

357
00:15:31,601 --> 00:15:33,061
Either wrap them up with other stuff,

358
00:15:33,161 --> 00:15:35,002
wait until you have other content to test to push them

359
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:37,883
or push them to just another public facing build

360
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:38,903
that isn't super friends.

361
00:15:38,943 --> 00:15:40,624
Say this is an optional test build on Steam,

362
00:15:40,644 --> 00:15:42,705
this will go live in a month, whatever like that.

363
00:15:43,685 --> 00:15:46,666
Lastly, your super friends are not

364
00:15:47,461 --> 00:15:48,806
They're not employees.

365
00:15:54,255 --> 00:15:56,316
are gonna have something that you could possibly show

366
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:57,997
that would ruin your plans if it gets out.

367
00:15:58,037 --> 00:16:00,538
Like these people are in your super friends group

368
00:16:00,678 --> 00:16:01,438
because they love you,

369
00:16:02,018 --> 00:16:04,600
but you can't just explicitly trust them 100%.

370
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,301
Don't show anything in this group

371
00:16:06,321 --> 00:16:08,342
that will absolutely ruin your plans if it gets out.

372
00:16:09,142 --> 00:16:10,383
It's very likely that if you're

373
00:16:10,743 --> 00:16:12,123
kind of a slow early access launch,

374
00:16:12,143 --> 00:16:13,024
this doesn't apply to you.

375
00:16:13,104 --> 00:16:15,545
And if the special stuff you're working on gets out

376
00:16:15,605 --> 00:16:17,726
to whoever actually cares about it at the time,

377
00:16:17,826 --> 00:16:19,827
that's probably fine, but just be aware.

378
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,380
Four, interact efficiently.

379
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:24,121
Section's about cutting down on the time

380
00:16:24,161 --> 00:16:25,282
that it takes to do this job right.

381
00:16:26,102 --> 00:16:27,863
Encourage public space feedback.

382
00:16:28,784 --> 00:16:30,044
So when you're communicating with your players,

383
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:31,865
encourage the use of forums,

384
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:33,406
encourage the use of Discord,

385
00:16:33,466 --> 00:16:36,188
encourage the use of any kind of public space

386
00:16:36,248 --> 00:16:38,429
where your words have a force multiplier,

387
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:40,250
where when you respond to something,

388
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,251
you can reach a whole lot of players at once

389
00:16:42,331 --> 00:16:44,372
instead of any one-to-one mediums

390
00:16:44,452 --> 00:16:47,613
like email or Twitter or calling me at three in the morning.

391
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,853
Reducing the number of times that you personally need

392
00:16:50,873 --> 00:16:52,514
to deliver a given message saves a lot more time

393
00:16:52,534 --> 00:16:54,335
for other stuff, just makes this take less time.

394
00:16:55,837 --> 00:16:59,039
Similarly, once your fans are using these public spaces,

395
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:01,341
once you have veteran players in your Steam community,

396
00:17:01,381 --> 00:17:02,802
in your Discord chats, stuff like that,

397
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,585
they're gonna answer a lot of questions for you.

398
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,206
They're gonna take over a lot of the softballs.

399
00:17:07,366 --> 00:17:09,328
If they've seen you answer a question once,

400
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:11,850
they're gonna come in the next time somebody else asks

401
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,311
and either directly link to your comment

402
00:17:13,371 --> 00:17:16,453
or say, here is the answer, and it's a huge win-win-win.

403
00:17:16,554 --> 00:17:18,575
You don't have to spend any time on this at all.

404
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:23,084
your veteran player gets to feel like they contributed to the community and they get to feel like they helped somebody, which they did,

405
00:17:23,646 --> 00:17:26,251
and the fan gets their question answered. Everybody wins, and it's awesome.

406
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:31,688
Here is an example of how we tried to encourage this with 20XX using the same awesome main

407
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:32,488
menu screenshot.

408
00:17:33,108 --> 00:17:37,310
You can see on the bottom there we've circled our community button, which at the time linked

409
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,630
directly to our Steam community because we hadn't done Discord yet.

410
00:17:40,571 --> 00:17:43,412
And we had a similar circle over there linking people to the subreddit.

411
00:17:43,992 --> 00:17:46,573
In hindsight, I don't know why we didn't just make that a separate button.

412
00:17:46,653 --> 00:17:48,153
We probably could have gotten away with that pretty easily.

413
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,814
This is also a perfect example of a mistake.

414
00:17:51,214 --> 00:17:53,115
I have an email address on my main menu screen.

415
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:56,376
And I have no idea where people are getting this email address,

416
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:59,677
but to this day, I still receive support emails for 20XX,

417
00:17:59,837 --> 00:18:02,478
even though this has been gone for literally two-plus years.

418
00:18:03,338 --> 00:18:05,099
Somehow this email address has circulated,

419
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:07,160
and now I'm doomed and stuck with it forever.

420
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,260
Always encourage public spaces.

421
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,061
Never encourage one-to-one mediums.

422
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:14,102
Of course, there will be some users that are not comfortable

423
00:18:14,142 --> 00:18:16,263
speaking out in a public space, and they will find your email

424
00:18:16,283 --> 00:18:18,383
or they will tweet at you anyway, and that's totally fine.

425
00:18:18,484 --> 00:18:20,864
But in general, make it clear that your preferred method

426
00:18:20,924 --> 00:18:21,645
is anything public.

427
00:18:23,576 --> 00:18:24,877
Like this, use a public bug database.

428
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:27,139
You're going to get fewer bug threads in the other communities.

429
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,381
If you're not already using a public database, please do.

430
00:18:29,782 --> 00:18:31,603
We use Mantis, but there are a ton of really good ones.

431
00:18:32,684 --> 00:18:34,146
Lead all of your bug complaints there.

432
00:18:34,286 --> 00:18:35,507
Get them out of your other communities.

433
00:18:35,587 --> 00:18:37,209
It turns them into more positive places.

434
00:18:37,889 --> 00:18:41,653
How many times have you loved playing a game and then the subreddit or the community for

435
00:18:41,713 --> 00:18:46,597
it after a big patch just turns into a big mess of bug complaints and nothing else?

436
00:18:47,358 --> 00:18:48,118
It really drags you down.

437
00:18:49,744 --> 00:18:51,125
Strategy two does apply here.

438
00:18:51,225 --> 00:18:52,885
You have to make sure you're visible in your bug tracker.

439
00:18:52,985 --> 00:18:54,646
If you have people reporting a lot of bugs,

440
00:18:54,686 --> 00:18:55,906
you need to make sure that you're spending

441
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,407
at least some amount of periodic time

442
00:18:57,827 --> 00:18:58,807
looking at your bug tracker,

443
00:18:58,907 --> 00:19:00,788
visibly fixing bugs, marking them complete,

444
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,428
submitting notes for feedback, stuff like that.

445
00:19:02,928 --> 00:19:04,489
Otherwise, people are gonna come to your bug tracker,

446
00:19:04,509 --> 00:19:06,350
they're gonna see a whole mess of open bugs

447
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,070
that haven't been interacted with in a long time,

448
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,671
assume the bug tracker is dead,

449
00:19:09,711 --> 00:19:10,811
and either not report the bug

450
00:19:10,931 --> 00:19:12,172
or report it on one of the other forums.

451
00:19:15,148 --> 00:19:15,689
Pick your battles.

452
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:16,589
Don't respond to everything.

453
00:19:17,009 --> 00:19:20,431
Over time you're going to get a really good sense of the kinds of messages that your veterans

454
00:19:20,471 --> 00:19:21,212
can handle for you.

455
00:19:21,592 --> 00:19:22,413
Ignore them entirely.

456
00:19:22,473 --> 00:19:23,233
Let your veterans do it.

457
00:19:24,114 --> 00:19:27,896
Take the time to respond to a player when they just make up a love thread.

458
00:19:27,936 --> 00:19:32,078
If they say thank you, developers, so much for this game, put yourself in their shoes.

459
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:36,201
If you are telling the developer of your absolute favourite game,

460
00:19:37,081 --> 00:19:38,922
how much it's meant to you and how much you've enjoyed playing it.

461
00:19:39,502 --> 00:19:42,964
There's really nothing that would make you happier than that developer coming right around and saying,

462
00:19:43,004 --> 00:19:47,147
God, thank you. This is the kind of thing, like, this is what I love. This is what keeps me going.

463
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:51,569
And closing that loop really cements them as a fan pretty much permanently.

464
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:55,111
This is a very easy way to convert somebody who likes your game into a permanent fan.

465
00:19:56,842 --> 00:19:59,064
Respond to popular feedback that you disagree with.

466
00:19:59,804 --> 00:20:04,548
If there's a long thread of comments or a big discussion about something in your game

467
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:09,752
that people want changed, that isn't aligned with your vision, that you don't intend to

468
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:13,235
do, your fan base is going to understand if you explain.

469
00:20:13,635 --> 00:20:17,158
This is where we are and here's why, instead of just completely ignoring them.

470
00:20:19,149 --> 00:20:20,370
Lastly, you can respond to feedback.

471
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:24,293
You should respond to feedback if it's not very popular, but is a good idea.

472
00:20:25,173 --> 00:20:29,277
The whole point of doing all of this is to get as much good feedback as possible, and

473
00:20:29,297 --> 00:20:33,280
it only takes one person with one idea, sometimes even in a single sentence to get a point across,

474
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,623
and responding to those sorts of people makes them a lot more likely to give you good feedback

475
00:20:37,663 --> 00:20:38,063
in the future.

476
00:20:40,165 --> 00:20:42,847
Don't respond to everything unless they're negative Steam reviews.

477
00:20:43,881 --> 00:20:46,723
Negative reviews can be a really good solid source of actionable information.

478
00:20:47,504 --> 00:20:52,367
For example, if multiple users post the same technical issue, I crashed when doing X, this

479
00:20:52,427 --> 00:20:56,831
is my negative review, you have no idea how many players are experiencing the exact same

480
00:20:56,871 --> 00:20:58,192
issue and just not telling you.

481
00:20:58,252 --> 00:21:00,533
They're either walking away from your game, they're leaving a negative review.

482
00:21:00,994 --> 00:21:03,796
Either way, they're not your fans and they don't like your game because of this thing.

483
00:21:04,636 --> 00:21:08,260
If multiple users post the same misconception, and we'll talk about this in a bit,

484
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,123
you probably have a messaging problem.

485
00:21:10,263 --> 00:21:13,106
If a lot of people are posting negative reviews in your Steam review section

486
00:21:13,526 --> 00:21:18,872
and saying, I didn't like certain thing about your game that you didn't actually intend for people to think,

487
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:23,597
you probably have some way that you're messaging your game or some way that you're appealing to users

488
00:21:24,138 --> 00:21:25,460
that doesn't align with what your game actually is.

489
00:21:26,517 --> 00:21:29,118
And if users have a pain point about the game's design

490
00:21:29,138 --> 00:21:31,899
that is intentional, for us, we were very heavily inspired

491
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:32,600
by Mega Man X.

492
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,621
The game is very challenging, the action is very precise,

493
00:21:36,281 --> 00:21:37,722
and for some people it's just real hard,

494
00:21:37,982 --> 00:21:39,283
and they wanna get into that kind of thing,

495
00:21:39,303 --> 00:21:40,243
and it's just not their cup of tea

496
00:21:40,263 --> 00:21:41,204
because it's real difficult.

497
00:21:42,104 --> 00:21:43,705
You may or may not have actionable information.

498
00:21:43,765 --> 00:21:47,166
Like, sometimes your vision is very solidly on the side of,

499
00:21:47,627 --> 00:21:49,528
well, you know, this game just isn't for these players,

500
00:21:49,568 --> 00:21:50,348
and that's kind of how it is,

501
00:21:50,408 --> 00:21:52,169
but sometimes you may realize

502
00:21:52,189 --> 00:21:53,830
that you can do something relatively small

503
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,190
to alleviate those pain points.

504
00:21:57,392 --> 00:22:00,514
As an aside, just a short story about how we learned something from our Steam reviews.

505
00:22:01,215 --> 00:22:07,238
In this super great pie chart, the green is the 31% of, oh, I didn't want to roguelike

506
00:22:07,298 --> 00:22:07,718
complaints.

507
00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:12,240
So just as a brief refresher, 20XX is an action platformer where everything is randomly generated

508
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:12,921
every time you play it.

509
00:22:12,941 --> 00:22:14,882
So you go through a set of levels, you die, you retry.

510
00:22:15,742 --> 00:22:19,846
And we had a lot, a lot, a lot of negative views, 31% of them, where it basically boiled

511
00:22:19,866 --> 00:22:23,108
down to, I wanted to play this style of game, but I didn't want to roguelike.

512
00:22:23,829 --> 00:22:26,190
And we were very sure that we had covered our bases on this.

513
00:22:26,491 --> 00:22:30,213
We said roguelike all over the place on our Steam page, pretty much all of our press stuff,

514
00:22:30,334 --> 00:22:33,196
all of our marketing sort of showcased this game loop.

515
00:22:33,656 --> 00:22:36,638
And for some reason, a lot of our fans, or a lot of our unfans, I guess, just weren't

516
00:22:36,658 --> 00:22:37,279
really getting that.

517
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:41,482
And we just sort of figured, you know, some people aren't going to read your game store page,

518
00:22:41,522 --> 00:22:43,324
some people are just going to look at your game, they're just going to buy it,

519
00:22:43,504 --> 00:22:44,485
and there's nothing you can do about it.

520
00:22:45,126 --> 00:22:48,248
And we eventually had a fan point out, hey, maybe, you know, games are really,

521
00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:52,652
these days, they're implementing a lot of different kinds of sets of roguelike elements,

522
00:22:52,692 --> 00:22:56,456
like some of them don't do permanent death, some of them do permanent expression, some don't.

523
00:22:57,056 --> 00:23:01,000
If you laid out exactly what you're doing, not only would fans of roguelike games

524
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,142
understand exactly what about your game is a roguelike.

525
00:23:03,462 --> 00:23:05,303
but people who don't understand roguelike games

526
00:23:05,323 --> 00:23:07,185
would also know exactly what those terms mean.

527
00:23:07,205 --> 00:23:09,807
And we're like, oh, oh Jesus, they're right.

528
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:10,647
Oh man.

529
00:23:11,468 --> 00:23:13,850
So we did that, and those reviews basically vanished.

530
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,772
We stopped seeing that influx almost entirely.

531
00:23:17,472 --> 00:23:18,913
And this was kind of a painful point for us.

532
00:23:18,973 --> 00:23:20,114
You know, we stopped the bleeding,

533
00:23:20,174 --> 00:23:21,555
but if we had done this off the break,

534
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,637
if we had messaged this properly from the get-go,

535
00:23:24,037 --> 00:23:25,658
there's a really good chance we'd still be over

536
00:23:25,698 --> 00:23:28,180
that 95% review threshold on Steam,

537
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,301
that overwhelmingly positive.

538
00:23:30,222 --> 00:23:32,404
And we believe that has an impact on sales,

539
00:23:32,464 --> 00:23:33,024
but we don't really know.

540
00:23:34,582 --> 00:23:36,944
Five, develop a motion agnostic evaluation.

541
00:23:37,185 --> 00:23:39,627
You have to learn to read feedback out of context.

542
00:23:40,287 --> 00:23:44,571
When you get a suggestion, when you get feedback, strip it of any context whatsoever.

543
00:23:44,931 --> 00:23:47,813
Ignore the way it's written, ignore the tone of the writer, ignore your relationship with

544
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:50,075
the writer, ignore the fact that the fan might be angry with you.

545
00:23:50,876 --> 00:23:53,598
Is the suggestion good for the game, and is it within scope?

546
00:23:54,018 --> 00:23:54,519
It's all that matters.

547
00:23:55,479 --> 00:23:59,620
Angry fans and players are often going to have good points and they're just mad because

548
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,681
they really care about your game and something has happened that is not the way they wanted

549
00:24:02,701 --> 00:24:03,222
the game to go.

550
00:24:03,902 --> 00:24:05,122
Obviously, this has its limits.

551
00:24:05,502 --> 00:24:09,904
If you have an upset or angry user who is resorting to either harassing you, harassing

552
00:24:09,944 --> 00:24:13,065
other players, hate speech, anything like that, ban them straight away.

553
00:24:13,245 --> 00:24:13,825
Don't deal with that.

554
00:24:14,145 --> 00:24:17,606
But somebody who is upset is not somebody you should inherently ignore.

555
00:24:18,627 --> 00:24:21,089
you know, try and forgive their undiplomatic approach

556
00:24:21,109 --> 00:24:21,810
to contacting you.

557
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,711
Similarly, don't reject feedback

558
00:24:23,731 --> 00:24:25,853
just because it's poorly written or poorly worded.

559
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:29,696
We have a user who speaks in some of the most broken English

560
00:24:29,736 --> 00:24:30,277
I've ever seen.

561
00:24:30,877 --> 00:24:32,439
It is as though I can't tell if it's,

562
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:35,341
it seems like he's kind of speaking in memes all the time,

563
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:38,664
but he's still like one of the best players of the game.

564
00:24:38,704 --> 00:24:40,025
He has really sharp suggestions.

565
00:24:40,065 --> 00:24:42,187
He has like specific design critiques

566
00:24:42,287 --> 00:24:43,888
and taking the time to like try

567
00:24:43,928 --> 00:24:45,129
and actually understand what he's saying.

568
00:24:45,169 --> 00:24:46,490
And sometimes it takes a really long time.

569
00:24:47,071 --> 00:24:48,192
has been entirely worth it for us.

570
00:24:48,872 --> 00:24:52,513
On the other hand, don't favor suggestions just because the community is clamoring for

571
00:24:52,553 --> 00:24:55,415
them or they are popular or because they are from your favorite players.

572
00:24:56,115 --> 00:24:57,175
And yes, we have favorite players.

573
00:24:57,936 --> 00:24:59,716
Popular suggestions aren't necessarily good ones.

574
00:25:00,517 --> 00:25:01,977
And lastly, hone your evaluation skills.

575
00:25:02,378 --> 00:25:06,639
All of this is about getting your community to trust you enough to give you all the feedback

576
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:07,080
you want.

577
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,341
And if you can't decide what good feedback is from bad, all of this is kind of worthless.

578
00:25:12,042 --> 00:25:14,183
Unfortunately, this is a little bit subjective.

579
00:25:14,944 --> 00:25:17,165
You have to define the ways that you judge feedback.

580
00:25:17,485 --> 00:25:19,126
For us, how well does it fit with the game?

581
00:25:19,426 --> 00:25:20,987
How well does it fit with our current community?

582
00:25:21,007 --> 00:25:23,789
Because once you're making a game on early access, you have to take that into account.

583
00:25:24,509 --> 00:25:25,570
What's the scope cost of this?

584
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:26,911
And what's the impact?

585
00:25:27,211 --> 00:25:28,232
Is this going to be good for my game?

586
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:29,813
Is it going to make my fans happy?

587
00:25:30,533 --> 00:25:32,314
Can I implement it quickly enough to be worth it?

588
00:25:32,334 --> 00:25:32,835
Do I have time?

589
00:25:33,595 --> 00:25:34,856
And is it actually impactful?

590
00:25:34,876 --> 00:25:37,798
You might have things that are really good fits but end up, when you think about them

591
00:25:37,838 --> 00:25:40,880
being kind of very minor or maybe only 1% of your fans are going to see them.

592
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,421
and so they're nowhere near as important.

593
00:25:43,402 --> 00:25:45,143
Each dimension obviously has weights that are gonna shift

594
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:46,284
over the course of development.

595
00:25:47,165 --> 00:25:49,186
When you are right at the beginning of production,

596
00:25:49,487 --> 00:25:50,968
you have plenty of scope, probably,

597
00:25:51,028 --> 00:25:52,409
as long as you have money to deal with it.

598
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:55,111
As you get closer and closer to shipping,

599
00:25:55,371 --> 00:25:56,793
you're probably gonna have to cut stuff

600
00:25:56,813 --> 00:25:58,294
and you're gonna have to be looking at great feedback

601
00:25:58,314 --> 00:26:00,616
you've already taken that you can no longer deal with

602
00:26:00,676 --> 00:26:00,756
by 1.0.

603
00:26:02,097 --> 00:26:03,278
So when evaluating suggestions,

604
00:26:03,638 --> 00:26:05,920
try and maximize positive community,

605
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,822
positive game stuff per unit scope.

606
00:26:09,893 --> 00:26:13,874
And as a final example of some of the concrete value we've gotten from our community, netplay

607
00:26:13,914 --> 00:26:14,634
testing sucks.

608
00:26:15,795 --> 00:26:17,255
Netplay testing sucks really hard.

609
00:26:18,055 --> 00:26:22,776
Setting up networked bug conditions, even if you get full repro steps, setting it up

610
00:26:22,816 --> 00:26:26,317
and testing it and trying to figure out what the hell is going on is so much worse and

611
00:26:26,457 --> 00:26:29,397
so much more time consuming than almost anything else we've dealt with.

612
00:26:30,117 --> 00:26:34,078
And as we built the game's online community, we got hundreds and hundreds and hundreds

613
00:26:34,118 --> 00:26:38,579
of hours of co-op footage of people playing the game with a friend online with fraps open

614
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:39,199
or something like that.

615
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,221
and sort of bug hunting.

616
00:26:41,241 --> 00:26:42,864
They'll play the game and then they will go through

617
00:26:42,884 --> 00:26:44,386
their hours and hours and hours of footage

618
00:26:44,786 --> 00:26:46,248
and they will clip out all of the bugs

619
00:26:46,329 --> 00:26:47,891
and they will say, here is a bug reel.

620
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:49,793
And they'll give us a ton of information

621
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:51,115
on every single last little thing.

622
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:53,298
So not only will they post all of that stuff

623
00:26:53,318 --> 00:26:54,680
in our tracker very neatly for us.

624
00:26:55,233 --> 00:26:56,914
but they even have video footage for everything.

625
00:26:57,454 --> 00:27:00,095
And without getting the respect of our community,

626
00:27:00,195 --> 00:27:03,056
if those fans didn't know that I was going to go over

627
00:27:03,196 --> 00:27:04,536
every single inch of that footage

628
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,316
and fix as much of stuff as I possibly could,

629
00:27:06,776 --> 00:27:07,397
they wouldn't have done it.

630
00:27:07,537 --> 00:27:10,317
We got thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars

631
00:27:10,377 --> 00:27:12,978
of free value out of them submitting these bug reports,

632
00:27:13,078 --> 00:27:14,478
and there's no way we could have shipped

633
00:27:14,538 --> 00:27:17,259
20XX's online multiplayer at 1.0 on time

634
00:27:17,479 --> 00:27:18,840
without their help, full stop.

635
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,302
And on top of that, most of your fans that are reporting these bugs do so with a really

636
00:27:23,502 --> 00:27:24,982
intimate knowledge of how the game works.

637
00:27:25,022 --> 00:27:28,984
They've played for hundreds of hours, they know exactly what this looks like, they have

638
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:32,846
a good feel for why something might be occurring because they know how your systems interlock

639
00:27:33,306 --> 00:27:35,467
better than third-party QA might.

640
00:27:35,548 --> 00:27:38,389
Obviously internal QA should know the game just as well as anybody else in the team,

641
00:27:39,069 --> 00:27:43,111
but if you try and use external QA that hasn't really seen your game a lot before instead,

642
00:27:44,012 --> 00:27:46,353
they're not going to do as good of a job, at least in our experience.

643
00:27:48,857 --> 00:27:54,200
This is a blank slide so a little bit of additional reading two years ago after we finished 20xx 1.0 on PC

644
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:57,321
I wrote a really really really detailed post-mortem on gama Sutra

645
00:27:58,002 --> 00:27:59,843
That has all of this stuff and an awful lot more

646
00:28:00,123 --> 00:28:03,785
Less than the kind of stuff that I learned over the course of making 20xx for four years

647
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,931
And I have two additional articles here.

648
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:10,713
I linked an article about community building on Discord from Andy Nguyen, in case you wanted

649
00:28:10,733 --> 00:28:14,795
more concrete stuff on how to actually get more eyeballs and build awareness of your

650
00:28:14,835 --> 00:28:15,856
community while you're making it.

651
00:28:16,376 --> 00:28:20,898
And I also linked Tanya Short's excellent Medium article about building Boyfriend Dungeons

652
00:28:20,938 --> 00:28:22,159
community pre-Kickstarter.

653
00:28:22,479 --> 00:28:23,619
I just sort of see those as...

654
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,822
supplemental information to the kinds of strategies that I used while making 20XX

655
00:28:28,503 --> 00:28:30,924
because they're much more about getting the people there in the first place

656
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:34,707
and my stuff is much more about keeping them engaged, keeping them loving you,

657
00:28:34,827 --> 00:28:36,348
and making the best use out of their feedback.

658
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:40,290
And that's my talk. Thank you so much for coming.

659
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,551
We probably have time for one question.

660
00:28:47,591 --> 00:28:50,894
If you have a question for Chris, please come to one of the mics in the aisles.

661
00:28:52,115 --> 00:28:55,018
And while we wait to see if anybody else has a question, I have one for you.

662
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:56,099
Okay.

663
00:28:56,119 --> 00:29:00,202
So how did you keep your update schedules consistent even when you were doing things like packs?

664
00:29:00,282 --> 00:29:01,764
Because it's pretty dang disruptive.

665
00:29:01,864 --> 00:29:04,446
So how did you manage to actually release something two weeks later?

666
00:29:04,958 --> 00:29:07,078
We would just plan all of that stuff out far enough in advance.

667
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:10,439
If we knew that there was going to be a week where we weren't going to get anything done,

668
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:14,880
we would basically finish an entire patch way ahead of schedule and then just release

669
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,480
it when it was time.

670
00:29:16,901 --> 00:29:17,501
It's all about planning.

671
00:29:17,921 --> 00:29:18,061
Right.

672
00:29:18,761 --> 00:29:21,442
Makes sense.

673
00:29:21,482 --> 00:29:21,582
Hi.

674
00:29:21,602 --> 00:29:28,383
I was wondering how many people you had and if each person kind of took a different medium,

675
00:29:28,443 --> 00:29:30,924
like one person did Reddit, one person did Steam.

676
00:29:32,496 --> 00:29:33,476
We had a couple of them.

677
00:29:33,756 --> 00:29:34,577
We had two full-timers.

678
00:29:34,617 --> 00:29:39,739
Sorry, the question was how many people did we have working, I guess, on the project or

679
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,060
just the community aspect of it.

680
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,922
There were two full-timers on 20XX and then a big army of part-timers doing things like

681
00:29:45,982 --> 00:29:47,343
sound and music and stuff like that.

682
00:29:47,603 --> 00:29:51,285
In terms of community engagement, it was basically just me, full stop.

683
00:29:52,286 --> 00:29:56,248
This might be something very particular about me as a person, but I am very anal when it

684
00:29:56,268 --> 00:29:58,649
comes to messaging and making sure that...

685
00:29:59,369 --> 00:30:02,510
my way of communicating with the community is upheld.

686
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,850
And as a result, I just kind of did all of that work myself.

687
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:08,751
You know, every so often, somebody else working on the project would interface with a fan,

688
00:30:09,091 --> 00:30:12,752
just sort of happen stancely, but it wouldn't be like, this is their job to do it.

689
00:30:12,792 --> 00:30:14,912
They would just see it every so often. So it was really all me.

690
00:30:16,572 --> 00:30:17,053
Was that helpful?

691
00:30:17,073 --> 00:30:17,313
Thanks.

692
00:30:18,853 --> 00:30:19,073
All right.

693
00:30:19,733 --> 00:30:23,934
All right, so please make sure you fill out your email surveys to give Chris feedback on his talk.

694
00:30:24,034 --> 00:30:24,654
Thank you so much, Chris.
