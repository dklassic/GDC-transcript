1
00:00:05,458 --> 00:00:06,658
My name is Corinne Scrivens.

2
00:00:07,479 --> 00:00:09,119
I am a principal artist at PolyArc

3
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:11,501
with eight years of experience in the games industry.

4
00:00:12,321 --> 00:00:14,862
Previously, I worked at Arena on Guild Wars 2,

5
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:16,163
and while at Bungie,

6
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:18,904
I helped create memorable Destiny characters

7
00:00:19,044 --> 00:00:22,505
like Aeris Morn, Amanda Holliday, Hawthorne, and others.

8
00:00:25,867 --> 00:00:28,948
In Moss, the player finds himself summoned to Helquil,

9
00:00:29,608 --> 00:00:31,789
a young mouse with dreams of greatness

10
00:00:31,809 --> 00:00:35,031
beyond the confines of a small and tranquil village.

11
00:00:36,298 --> 00:00:41,062
Quill must embark on an epic journey, and she needs you there by her side.

12
00:00:42,403 --> 00:00:48,929
Together you'll travel to forgotten realms, solve challenging puzzles, and battle menacing enemies.

13
00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:55,874
Alone, no one can conquer what you're up against. But united, you may defeat even the darkest of villains.

14
00:00:58,428 --> 00:01:01,090
Today, I will be going over how we created this story

15
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,051
and how embracing constraints,

16
00:01:03,371 --> 00:01:06,613
whether it be from technology, team size, or schedule,

17
00:01:07,153 --> 00:01:09,254
actually helped lead us to finding

18
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:10,695
even more creative solutions.

19
00:01:11,596 --> 00:01:14,157
Today, I will be going over the processes that we used

20
00:01:14,717 --> 00:01:16,739
to make sure that these solutions fit

21
00:01:16,779 --> 00:01:18,620
within the constraints of our production

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,801
while playing up the strengths of the medium of VR.

23
00:01:25,443 --> 00:01:27,144
But first, some background on who we are.

24
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,001
Moss was the first game developed by Polyarc.

25
00:01:30,462 --> 00:01:33,444
We're a small, independent studio dedicated

26
00:01:33,504 --> 00:01:35,706
to creating compelling characters

27
00:01:35,866 --> 00:01:37,787
and developing a world's.

28
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,891
For Moss, we had 15 employees,

29
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:45,593
only 12 of which were full-time game developers.

30
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:49,556
And two full-time dogs.

31
00:01:52,675 --> 00:01:55,317
Today, I will start with how understanding the medium led

32
00:01:55,337 --> 00:01:56,998
to designing our characters in a way

33
00:01:57,058 --> 00:01:59,140
that they could take full advantage of VR.

34
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:03,022
From there, I will cover how gameplay

35
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:04,843
helped form our story and the approach

36
00:02:04,883 --> 00:02:06,704
that we used for building our world.

37
00:02:09,907 --> 00:02:11,888
Lastly, I go over our process for finding

38
00:02:11,928 --> 00:02:13,549
how to deliver a story to players

39
00:02:14,029 --> 00:02:16,171
in a way that works well for both our medium

40
00:02:16,491 --> 00:02:17,612
and our production schedule.

41
00:02:20,806 --> 00:02:22,407
But first, our medium and characters.

42
00:02:23,287 --> 00:02:24,568
Like any game developer,

43
00:02:24,588 --> 00:02:27,309
you want to make good games that people want to play.

44
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,510
Creating for a new medium like VR,

45
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,451
the first step is figuring out

46
00:02:33,851 --> 00:02:35,592
what even makes a good VR game.

47
00:02:36,873 --> 00:02:38,913
This is why a postmortem about the story

48
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:41,715
and narrative of Moss has to start with its medium.

49
00:02:43,094 --> 00:02:45,635
And the reason why I'll be saying the word medium

50
00:02:45,696 --> 00:02:48,578
so much in my talk is because a lot of these principles

51
00:02:48,618 --> 00:02:50,719
could be applied to any cutting-edge medium,

52
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,301
like AR, MR, et cetera.

53
00:02:54,822 --> 00:02:58,225
To tackle these new challenges, we turn to these principles.

54
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:00,667
Deer.

55
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:05,691
The first part of deer is defining

56
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:07,532
what is needed to achieve your goals,

57
00:03:08,413 --> 00:03:10,654
to find out how to create a good VR game.

58
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:14,514
This means taking the time to truly understand the medium,

59
00:03:14,974 --> 00:03:18,796
the current state of it, its strengths, and its weaknesses.

60
00:03:20,637 --> 00:03:23,339
In early 2015, when we first started working on Moss,

61
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:25,080
we took a look at the state of VR.

62
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,902
And one of our founders, Danny Bulla, observed that

63
00:03:30,223 --> 00:03:33,184
the state of VR was equivalent to the early 8-bit days

64
00:03:33,304 --> 00:03:34,805
of flat-screen game development.

65
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,880
Tracked head and hand headsets like the Oculus, Vive,

66
00:03:38,961 --> 00:03:41,622
and PlayStation VR, they hadn't even come out yet.

67
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:44,323
And most people never even put on a headset.

68
00:03:45,704 --> 00:03:48,625
Everything in VR could be a new experience for players,

69
00:03:49,386 --> 00:03:50,786
like the 8-bit days of games.

70
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:54,768
We suspected that the newness of this experience

71
00:03:54,808 --> 00:03:56,469
would be engaging enough where we didn't

72
00:03:56,529 --> 00:03:59,371
need the complex gameplay systems used in modern-day

73
00:03:59,391 --> 00:03:59,691
games.

74
00:04:01,005 --> 00:04:05,849
And I think you can see this nowadays in hits like Beat Saber or Tetris Effect.

75
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:12,514
Over time, this will probably change. I mean, compare Super Mario Brothers to Super Mario

76
00:04:12,594 --> 00:04:17,397
Odyssey, and you'll see that, yeah, the gameplay has become more complex over time.

77
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:23,922
But looking at the state of VR at that time, this was something that we thought we could use.

78
00:04:27,692 --> 00:04:29,253
Because of this, our game's controls

79
00:04:29,293 --> 00:04:31,675
would mirror the simple controls used in 8-bit games.

80
00:04:32,516 --> 00:04:35,438
This would enable our game to be accessible to as many people

81
00:04:35,498 --> 00:04:40,182
as possible, which was important in a new and slowly growing VR

82
00:04:40,222 --> 00:04:40,642
market.

83
00:04:41,983 --> 00:04:44,745
We focused on first-time players because we suspected

84
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,787
that whatever appealed to them would also

85
00:04:46,847 --> 00:04:48,949
appeal to any of the early adopters.

86
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:54,273
Next, we looked at existing games

87
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,835
to find the strengths and weaknesses of this new medium.

88
00:04:59,404 --> 00:05:02,686
In Portal Aperture Robot Repair, a drawer opens up,

89
00:05:02,766 --> 00:05:06,109
revealing a tiny Pocky universe of tiny office workers.

90
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:10,973
This showed us how enjoyable it is to look over a diorama in VR.

91
00:05:13,235 --> 00:05:16,958
In Job Simulator, it highlighted how fun it was to reach out

92
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:19,400
and physically interact with objects in the environment.

93
00:05:21,742 --> 00:05:25,605
This research helped us define what we want to achieve in our game.

94
00:05:28,105 --> 00:05:31,368
The first was creating our own tiny diorama world

95
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:33,089
to interact with.

96
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,833
This identified the need for some kind of smaller character

97
00:05:36,853 --> 00:05:39,375
to interact with our player.

98
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:44,019
The second was forming the pillars of what would

99
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:45,180
be important to our game.

100
00:05:46,361 --> 00:05:47,743
The first pillar came from the games

101
00:05:47,763 --> 00:05:50,265
that showed us what did not work well in VR,

102
00:05:50,805 --> 00:05:53,248
and it showcased the challenges of this new medium.

103
00:05:56,208 --> 00:06:03,013
Comfort. This was our number one concern because a person putting on a bulky headset for the first time

104
00:06:03,593 --> 00:06:05,655
is already in a position of discomfort.

105
00:06:07,296 --> 00:06:13,380
To make this game accessible to as many people as possible, we had to make it as comfortable as possible.

106
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:17,743
Our research showed that couch scale games were the most accessible

107
00:06:18,243 --> 00:06:23,227
and that moving the player's camera was a bad idea because we would likely be making them sick.

108
00:06:24,688 --> 00:06:25,488
Our number two pillar

109
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,611
physical interactions.

110
00:06:30,312 --> 00:06:33,694
Job simulators showed us that reaching out and interacting

111
00:06:33,714 --> 00:06:36,976
with objects pulled players into the world in a way that

112
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:39,017
couldn't be replicated in non-VR.

113
00:06:40,538 --> 00:06:45,382
And our third pillar, an extraordinary world

114
00:06:45,442 --> 00:06:46,663
that you want to be in.

115
00:06:48,164 --> 00:06:50,865
The immersion of VR provides a unique opportunity

116
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:53,487
to transport players, and we were really

117
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:55,408
excited to take players to a place

118
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:57,450
that they couldn't get to ordinarily.

119
00:06:59,578 --> 00:07:01,798
By taking the time to truly understand the medium,

120
00:07:01,998 --> 00:07:03,859
we knew we wanted to make a couch scale game

121
00:07:04,359 --> 00:07:07,840
with simple controls and a tiny diorama world to look over.

122
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,541
Our focus would be on comfort, physical interactions,

123
00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:14,201
and an extraordinary world.

124
00:07:17,442 --> 00:07:19,142
We revisited our friend, the deer,

125
00:07:20,102 --> 00:07:23,443
and next we embraced both our constraints and our strengths.

126
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,912
This ensured that our plans take full advantage

127
00:07:26,952 --> 00:07:27,913
of our team's strengths,

128
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:30,674
while ensuring that we're planning to address

129
00:07:30,874 --> 00:07:33,135
any of the constraints that we might have to produce with it.

130
00:07:34,756 --> 00:07:37,918
What were our constraints while we were creating Moss?

131
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:43,761
Well, a big one was no one knew who we were.

132
00:07:44,682 --> 00:07:47,263
Polyarch was a little unknown indie studio

133
00:07:47,303 --> 00:07:48,584
that had yet to ship the title.

134
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,523
This meant we had a small budget to work with,

135
00:07:51,643 --> 00:07:55,525
which translated to a short development cycle of just 18 months.

136
00:07:57,066 --> 00:07:59,527
And we couldn't afford to slip on our deadline.

137
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:05,331
A smaller budget also meant a smaller team.

138
00:08:06,331 --> 00:08:08,112
Our team's background included

139
00:08:09,353 --> 00:08:13,075
three business and operations for character artists,

140
00:08:14,316 --> 00:08:16,217
three combatant and sandbox designers,

141
00:08:17,226 --> 00:08:22,367
three engineers, one sound designer, and one animator.

142
00:08:23,848 --> 00:08:25,788
And if you're wondering how one animator

143
00:08:25,828 --> 00:08:27,629
did all the animations in our game,

144
00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:32,430
you can check out Rick Lico's 2018 GDC talk,

145
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,710
Animating Quill, and his SIGGRAPH talk,

146
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,151
Freeform Space Switching.

147
00:08:39,472 --> 00:08:44,393
While small, combined our team has over a century of experience

148
00:08:44,473 --> 00:08:45,693
working on well-known titles.

149
00:08:46,707 --> 00:08:52,548
This experience and the fact that most of our team is character focused were strengths that we knew we could use.

150
00:08:54,228 --> 00:08:59,650
Looking at our research results, our short time frame, small team and our developer strengths,

151
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:05,951
a third person puzzle action adventure game seemed like it might be a good fit for our first title.

152
00:09:11,612 --> 00:09:13,473
Next was the second Ian Deer.

153
00:09:15,265 --> 00:09:16,846
experimenting and exploring.

154
00:09:17,587 --> 00:09:20,409
This is an important step, but even more so

155
00:09:20,549 --> 00:09:22,770
in an unexplored medium like VR.

156
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:25,852
Because we are a character-focused team,

157
00:09:26,213 --> 00:09:29,275
we decided to start with exploring our characters.

158
00:09:32,176 --> 00:09:35,939
We knew we had a small character for a tiny diorama world,

159
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,641
but who was this character?

160
00:09:38,921 --> 00:09:40,882
Why were they so much smaller than the player?

161
00:09:42,354 --> 00:09:45,815
The first idea was inspired by the third person perspective

162
00:09:45,855 --> 00:09:47,296
in traditional flat screen games.

163
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,678
What if the player was a giant

164
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,098
and the character was actually normal sized?

165
00:09:56,099 --> 00:09:58,580
We ended up not going with this idea

166
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,441
because being a giant isn't a relatable experience

167
00:10:01,481 --> 00:10:02,141
for most people.

168
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:07,263
At that size, the world would feel strange and different.

169
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:12,513
Also, making a believable human character is hard,

170
00:10:12,573 --> 00:10:14,013
and it takes a lot of time.

171
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:16,375
A lot of time that we didn't have.

172
00:10:18,816 --> 00:10:21,577
We decided our character had to be a smaller scale

173
00:10:21,618 --> 00:10:22,238
than the player.

174
00:10:22,258 --> 00:10:25,740
How can we theme the visuals to explain this?

175
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,183
Toys could explain the size difference,

176
00:10:31,763 --> 00:10:34,364
and there's plenty of prior art for toys coming to life.

177
00:10:35,557 --> 00:10:36,737
It's very relatable.

178
00:10:36,997 --> 00:10:40,259
Nearly everyone has had toys or played with toys growing up.

179
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:44,681
However, concerns arose that because it was our first idea,

180
00:10:45,202 --> 00:10:48,403
that other VR developers could come up with the same solution.

181
00:10:50,224 --> 00:10:52,685
Also important, not everyone on our team

182
00:10:52,725 --> 00:10:54,847
was excited to work on a game about toys.

183
00:10:58,148 --> 00:11:00,669
The next idea was a little alien companion.

184
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,102
This also has plenty of prior art,

185
00:11:04,822 --> 00:11:07,024
and we could have more fun with the character designs.

186
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:10,748
However, there are concerns that it could be hard

187
00:11:10,888 --> 00:11:13,030
to get players to connect emotionally

188
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,391
with an alien companion.

189
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:20,557
So we needed a theme that explained the size difference,

190
00:11:21,398 --> 00:11:22,899
was not an obvious solution,

191
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:27,323
yet was relatable and easy to connect with.

192
00:11:29,108 --> 00:11:32,032
What type of visuals could accomplish all of this?

193
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:39,579
The next idea, small animals in armor.

194
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,164
Cute animals are easy to evoke emotional connection with.

195
00:11:45,065 --> 00:11:47,708
They are relatable, tapping into people's memories

196
00:11:47,788 --> 00:11:49,550
of having and caring for a pet.

197
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:53,960
And while yes, prior art does exist for this genre,

198
00:11:54,241 --> 00:11:56,702
Polyarch felt like it was a unique enough solution

199
00:11:57,242 --> 00:11:59,683
that it was unlikely another VR developer

200
00:11:59,703 --> 00:12:00,944
would come up with the same theme.

201
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,126
Also important, this was an idea

202
00:12:06,246 --> 00:12:08,948
that everyone in the studio was excited to work on.

203
00:12:12,477 --> 00:12:14,618
Chris Alderson, the art director on Moss,

204
00:12:15,219 --> 00:12:17,160
did some concept experiments to see

205
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,341
if this theme could hold up for multiple characters.

206
00:12:20,221 --> 00:12:21,682
People wanted to go on adventures

207
00:12:21,722 --> 00:12:23,743
with the small, roguish mouse to the left.

208
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:26,465
So this became the starting point for our hero.

209
00:12:29,847 --> 00:12:32,288
The next experiment was a gameplay prototype

210
00:12:32,488 --> 00:12:36,070
with this hero in a third-person puzzle action adventure game.

211
00:12:37,011 --> 00:12:38,731
This gave us real production times

212
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:40,993
that we could use to see if creating this game

213
00:12:41,033 --> 00:12:42,113
would fit our deadline.

214
00:12:43,409 --> 00:12:47,153
Fun fact, it was this demo that convinced me to take a chance

215
00:12:47,314 --> 00:12:49,496
and leave my job at Bungie to join PolyArk.

216
00:12:50,617 --> 00:12:52,920
I mean, where else would I get the chance

217
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,523
to work on a game with a tiny, adorable,

218
00:12:55,563 --> 00:12:56,724
sword-wielding mouse in it?

219
00:12:59,307 --> 00:13:01,049
To figure out if this was the type of game

220
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:04,333
we wanted to create, we turned to the last letter of deer.

221
00:13:07,405 --> 00:13:10,688
This ensures that we aren't making subjective decisions,

222
00:13:11,328 --> 00:13:13,349
but data and fact-based ones.

223
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,231
When working in a new medium like VR,

224
00:13:16,431 --> 00:13:19,453
playtesting is essential for challenging

225
00:13:19,473 --> 00:13:20,494
your preconceptions.

226
00:13:21,395 --> 00:13:23,676
This can reveal unexpected paths

227
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,357
for your development to explore.

228
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,322
Playtests showed the gameplay was a success,

229
00:13:33,163 --> 00:13:35,864
and they revealed something unexpected for our pillars.

230
00:13:37,021 --> 00:13:39,042
People would talk to the little character,

231
00:13:39,442 --> 00:13:41,443
giving it encouragement if it missed a jump,

232
00:13:41,843 --> 00:13:43,483
even though it was the player themself

233
00:13:43,543 --> 00:13:45,424
that was either making or missing that jump.

234
00:13:46,964 --> 00:13:48,125
They tried to high-five them

235
00:13:48,185 --> 00:13:49,685
after making it through challenges,

236
00:13:49,825 --> 00:13:52,907
and they spent way too long trying to pet them.

237
00:13:56,148 --> 00:13:57,768
This revealed a fourth pillar

238
00:13:57,788 --> 00:13:59,929
and a new focus for our development.

239
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,051
Meaningful character relationships.

240
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:10,213
we knew that we had to make the hero a pillar of our game.

241
00:14:13,495 --> 00:14:14,876
With our main character figured out,

242
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:16,737
it was on to developing the player.

243
00:14:17,878 --> 00:14:19,439
Our pillar of physical interaction

244
00:14:19,539 --> 00:14:22,301
meant that we wanted the player to reach out into a world

245
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:23,882
to physically interact with it.

246
00:14:25,363 --> 00:14:27,945
This took our game from a third-person perspective

247
00:14:28,005 --> 00:14:29,786
into a first-person perspective.

248
00:14:30,487 --> 00:14:33,108
The player themself would be a character in the world

249
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:34,870
and not just a camera.

250
00:14:38,196 --> 00:14:41,457
To do this, we went through this process all over again.

251
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:46,340
We looked over a medium, which was a state of VR tech

252
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:46,860
at the time.

253
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,702
Our third-person gameplay meant that we wanted a joystick,

254
00:14:50,842 --> 00:14:53,383
and the PlayStation Move controllers didn't have one.

255
00:14:56,044 --> 00:14:58,305
But there is a joystick on the DualShock controller.

256
00:14:59,126 --> 00:15:02,087
This gave the player two track points, one for the head

257
00:15:02,647 --> 00:15:03,888
and one between both hands.

258
00:15:05,975 --> 00:15:10,218
Unlike the Move Controller, the DualShock Controller only has a small light bar on the

259
00:15:10,238 --> 00:15:16,202
front of the controller, and this could lose sight of the tracking camera, and thus temporarily

260
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,623
lose positional tracking.

261
00:15:18,664 --> 00:15:26,169
What this meant was, if we used a realistic in-game hand, it could give the disturbing

262
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:28,891
feeling that your hand was detaching from your body.

263
00:15:32,189 --> 00:15:34,470
So I started with this experiment.

264
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:37,292
This is a block model for a weird,

265
00:15:37,372 --> 00:15:38,953
stylized version of a hand.

266
00:15:39,834 --> 00:15:42,916
The idea was your hand floating off into space

267
00:15:43,096 --> 00:15:44,897
might be less disturbing if it was themed

268
00:15:44,997 --> 00:15:47,659
as some strange energy undersea creature,

269
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,440
as opposed to a physical part of your body.

270
00:15:51,321 --> 00:15:54,003
And what we found was it worked.

271
00:15:54,503 --> 00:15:55,784
It was less disturbing.

272
00:15:56,965 --> 00:15:58,105
The downside was...

273
00:15:59,573 --> 00:16:01,274
This hand felt weird.

274
00:16:02,715 --> 00:16:06,056
The fingers would reach out and stretch towards objects to grab them.

275
00:16:06,736 --> 00:16:08,717
This helped if we lost positional tracking,

276
00:16:09,257 --> 00:16:13,118
but we lost the physical feeling of reaching out into the world.

277
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:16,920
Having a non-physical hand felt good,

278
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,481
but we needed something less alien-feeling.

279
00:16:23,062 --> 00:16:26,843
So, I removed the fingers, and the next test was a simple orb.

280
00:16:28,008 --> 00:16:31,870
A ribbon particle effect was added to make the hand feel like a toy that could be played

281
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,752
with, adding personality to the orb.

282
00:16:34,572 --> 00:16:39,195
Playtests showed that players thought of the orb as mischievous when it floated off, instead

283
00:16:39,255 --> 00:16:40,496
of feeling disturbed by it.

284
00:16:43,998 --> 00:16:48,681
Instead of fingers, the hand used the idea of a stretchy hand toy to grab to objects.

285
00:16:50,617 --> 00:16:52,338
The core of the orb would stay in place,

286
00:16:52,619 --> 00:16:54,820
and the outside of the orb would attach to the object.

287
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,821
The player then interacted with the object

288
00:16:57,241 --> 00:16:59,123
by pulling on it as if they were pulling on it

289
00:16:59,163 --> 00:16:59,763
with a string.

290
00:17:01,364 --> 00:17:03,986
If you're interested in learning more about how we use this hand

291
00:17:04,006 --> 00:17:05,347
with our interactions in our game,

292
00:17:05,887 --> 00:17:10,050
you can check out Brendan Walker and Joss Dixma's 2018 VRDC

293
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:12,731
talk, The Design of VR Interactions in MOS.

294
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,190
With the hands done, it was on to figuring out a face

295
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,310
for our player character.

296
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,071
We did not have the time to create

297
00:17:28,231 --> 00:17:30,752
any type of convincing human face

298
00:17:30,772 --> 00:17:32,753
or any type of facial animations.

299
00:17:34,874 --> 00:17:37,135
This made a mask a good solution for us.

300
00:17:37,955 --> 00:17:40,056
While simple, it still does a great job

301
00:17:40,076 --> 00:17:42,217
of showing exactly where a player is looking.

302
00:17:43,478 --> 00:17:46,239
With our limited schedule and only having two tracked points,

303
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:50,861
creating a full body that felt good was also out of scope.

304
00:17:51,952 --> 00:17:55,694
However, making a neck was feasible.

305
00:17:56,454 --> 00:17:58,475
This helped turn the mask from a floating object

306
00:17:58,636 --> 00:17:59,996
into a full character.

307
00:18:01,277 --> 00:18:03,538
By fading out the neck before it reached the shoulders,

308
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,820
we didn't have to create a full body.

309
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,401
This led to the character being themed

310
00:18:08,581 --> 00:18:13,204
as some kind of non-physical energy character,

311
00:18:13,304 --> 00:18:15,065
instead of the typical physical character.

312
00:18:16,873 --> 00:18:19,553
Giving the player a face lets us show them

313
00:18:19,613 --> 00:18:21,974
that they themselves are a character in the world.

314
00:18:25,015 --> 00:18:26,695
When you meet our hero for the first time,

315
00:18:27,215 --> 00:18:29,655
players notice the reflection in the water beneath them.

316
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:32,036
Being a character in the world enables

317
00:18:32,096 --> 00:18:34,797
a stronger connection with the other characters, like Quill.

318
00:18:36,037 --> 00:18:37,537
This adds to the immersion of VR,

319
00:18:37,637 --> 00:18:40,318
making this reflection moment a powerful experience

320
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,778
that can't be experienced flat on a screen like this.

321
00:18:48,058 --> 00:18:50,799
We used our understanding of the medium to design our characters

322
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,060
in a way where they could take full advantage

323
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,100
of the strengths of VR.

324
00:18:55,321 --> 00:18:57,902
We combined this with embracing our strengths and constraints

325
00:18:58,342 --> 00:19:01,083
to help us figure out what type of game to create.

326
00:19:02,864 --> 00:19:04,685
Now we know who our characters are.

327
00:19:06,205 --> 00:19:10,047
But how do we make sense of a tiny mouse with a sword

328
00:19:10,647 --> 00:19:13,228
who is somehow partnered up with the mysterious

329
00:19:13,388 --> 00:19:15,829
masked energy figure with the orb for a hand?

330
00:19:17,005 --> 00:19:21,329
How do we make a game out of these elements that feels well thought out and put together?

331
00:19:25,253 --> 00:19:29,677
For us, next was developing the world and story that made sense of these characters.

332
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:32,840
We began with our hero.

333
00:19:35,303 --> 00:19:40,267
We started with players expressing themselves by picking the gender that they wanted to play.

334
00:19:41,518 --> 00:19:43,919
Problem was, this made the players feel like

335
00:19:44,019 --> 00:19:45,800
that they themselves were the hero,

336
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,561
making any type of meaningful relationship

337
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:50,482
between the two impossible.

338
00:19:53,703 --> 00:19:56,164
Taking away this choice made the hero

339
00:19:56,224 --> 00:19:58,065
a separate character from our player,

340
00:19:58,946 --> 00:20:00,686
making our game not a third-person

341
00:20:00,906 --> 00:20:03,928
or a first-person game, but a new hybrid of the two.

342
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:08,770
Playtests showed that people either A,

343
00:20:09,807 --> 00:20:11,468
didn't care about the hero's gender,

344
00:20:12,108 --> 00:20:16,151
or B, they were really excited to see a female character.

345
00:20:17,451 --> 00:20:19,773
And our team was excited about creating

346
00:20:19,793 --> 00:20:21,494
a strong female protagonist.

347
00:20:21,794 --> 00:20:25,436
So we picked this gender for our hero.

348
00:20:26,937 --> 00:20:30,900
And our hero had to be strong because gameplay

349
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,021
showed it was more fun if the hero was capable.

350
00:20:33,862 --> 00:20:35,563
She could attack to take out enemies.

351
00:20:37,425 --> 00:20:40,286
and there are triggers in the world that only she could activate.

352
00:20:43,407 --> 00:20:46,188
This established the player and hero relationship.

353
00:20:46,988 --> 00:20:50,270
It was a partnership, and they would have to work together to succeed.

354
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,771
But how do we explain this partnership?

355
00:20:55,112 --> 00:20:58,273
Why is this mouse being followed by a masked energy figure?

356
00:21:00,194 --> 00:21:02,895
To figure this out, we look to our gameplay again.

357
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:08,347
The book was added to the gameplay prototype for the pillar of wanting

358
00:21:08,407 --> 00:21:11,089
to take players to a world they couldn't get to ordinarily.

359
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,592
By bookending this experience with the book,

360
00:21:16,273 --> 00:21:20,576
what happens is this book becomes the portal to a new world.

361
00:21:23,398 --> 00:21:28,081
This book motif led to the idea of naming our player, the reader,

362
00:21:28,401 --> 00:21:32,364
and our hero, Quill, after the pen because it's

363
00:21:32,484 --> 00:21:34,725
through her actions that the story is written.

364
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,137
Next was explaining the connection

365
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:39,678
between their two worlds.

366
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,943
The reader enters the world of Moss by reading a book

367
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:47,104
within an old, mysterious library.

368
00:21:47,985 --> 00:21:50,487
The book is the library's connection to Quill's world.

369
00:21:51,288 --> 00:21:53,930
So what's Quill's connection to the reader's world?

370
00:21:56,892 --> 00:21:59,675
The glass was created as a physical representation

371
00:21:59,715 --> 00:22:00,295
of this link.

372
00:22:01,757 --> 00:22:03,378
She finds it while exploring the woods

373
00:22:03,498 --> 00:22:04,859
and is chosen by the reader.

374
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:08,301
Through the glass, you feel what Quill does.

375
00:22:10,483 --> 00:22:13,366
You can see this from its brightness when Quill runs around,

376
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:18,452
to the red pulse and sparks whenever Quill is injured,

377
00:22:21,055 --> 00:22:23,998
or from its soft glow to the pulse of Quill's heartbeat

378
00:22:24,318 --> 00:22:26,260
when reaching out to hold and heal her.

379
00:22:28,853 --> 00:22:30,354
With this connection identified,

380
00:22:30,374 --> 00:22:32,935
Nex was finding the reason to adventure together,

381
00:22:33,795 --> 00:22:36,736
a hero's incentive that players could relate to

382
00:22:36,976 --> 00:22:38,356
and get invested in.

383
00:22:41,237 --> 00:22:44,458
We experimented with a vague campfire story for the game.

384
00:22:45,258 --> 00:22:47,419
Playtesting this, we found that everyone

385
00:22:47,639 --> 00:22:49,780
responded positively to the phrase,

386
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,941
to save a loved one.

387
00:22:55,617 --> 00:22:57,378
This pulled at people's heartstrings,

388
00:22:57,518 --> 00:22:59,679
and it made them want to help her succeed.

389
00:22:59,699 --> 00:23:04,700
To find her loved one, we needed more characters in our world.

390
00:23:08,702 --> 00:23:10,842
Argus was created to contrast Quill.

391
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:13,723
Where Quill is young and inexperienced,

392
00:23:14,084 --> 00:23:15,744
Argus is old and grizzled.

393
00:23:16,864 --> 00:23:18,465
Argus is Quill's uncle and mentor,

394
00:23:18,685 --> 00:23:20,466
and the reason why she could use a sword.

395
00:23:21,749 --> 00:23:26,230
He has seen plenty of battle and he wants to protect Quill from the dangers in the world.

396
00:23:31,171 --> 00:23:37,452
This relationship, the connection between the two, is vital for providing our hero's incentive.

397
00:23:39,813 --> 00:23:45,094
So when he disappears, it's believable that Quill would follow a mysterious ally to adventure.

398
00:23:48,098 --> 00:23:51,041
And the journey lets us introduce enough interesting characters

399
00:23:51,101 --> 00:23:54,184
to showcase the variety and complexity contained

400
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:54,945
within our world.

401
00:23:56,707 --> 00:23:59,129
Now we needed something to save our uncle from.

402
00:24:01,812 --> 00:24:03,694
Ideally, something that would let us avoid

403
00:24:03,754 --> 00:24:05,515
the trap of the larger Death Star,

404
00:24:06,536 --> 00:24:08,598
providing an organic and believable way

405
00:24:08,678 --> 00:24:11,001
of raising the stakes without reusing

406
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:12,422
the same threat repeatedly.

407
00:24:15,318 --> 00:24:17,359
This led to the idea of the arcane.

408
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,042
These enemies come in all different forms,

409
00:24:20,322 --> 00:24:21,623
each with different abilities,

410
00:24:22,644 --> 00:24:25,726
all powered by the same strange shadowy energy.

411
00:24:26,987 --> 00:24:29,769
This lets us change the form of the threat to our hero.

412
00:24:32,311 --> 00:24:35,774
To include beasts of monstrous size, like Sarfog,

413
00:24:36,215 --> 00:24:39,157
a giant snake who has destroyed the mice's old home

414
00:24:39,257 --> 00:24:40,758
and sent them running to the forest.

415
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:46,712
And who now has Quill's uncle, hopeless in its grasp?

416
00:24:49,073 --> 00:24:50,614
With the heroes and scent to figure it out,

417
00:24:50,854 --> 00:24:52,775
we moved on to building our world.

418
00:24:55,277 --> 00:24:57,278
To figure out how to approach world building,

419
00:24:57,858 --> 00:24:59,259
we looked to these stories.

420
00:25:02,121 --> 00:25:04,442
The first Harry Potter book took JK Rowling

421
00:25:04,642 --> 00:25:08,044
five years to write because she was developing the world

422
00:25:08,105 --> 00:25:09,966
and she was planning out all seven books

423
00:25:10,026 --> 00:25:11,446
in the series at the same time.

424
00:25:13,837 --> 00:25:16,818
Meanwhile, J.R.R. Tolkien took 10 years

425
00:25:17,498 --> 00:25:18,639
to write The Lord of the Rings,

426
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:21,159
spending the time not only writing the book,

427
00:25:21,579 --> 00:25:24,140
but literal books worth of appendix material

428
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,761
so he could understand his stories

429
00:25:25,821 --> 00:25:27,221
in the context of the world.

430
00:25:30,022 --> 00:25:33,043
And George Lucas was known to have binders full of profiles

431
00:25:33,163 --> 00:25:34,903
about different planets in his universe.

432
00:25:35,603 --> 00:25:38,084
These planets, they never showed up in the films,

433
00:25:38,724 --> 00:25:40,885
but they helped inform his story

434
00:25:41,025 --> 00:25:42,605
in the universe that they were within.

435
00:25:45,369 --> 00:25:49,131
All this work developed worlds that fans wanted to spend more time in.

436
00:25:50,112 --> 00:25:54,275
They felt like actual places, complete with history and rules.

437
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:57,436
Characters had factions with rivalries and

438
00:25:57,477 --> 00:26:00,458
friendships based off their past experiences with one another.

439
00:26:00,478 --> 00:26:05,041
And any fantastical or magical elements of the world

440
00:26:05,401 --> 00:26:08,663
followed a set of rules that made it all feel more believable.

441
00:26:11,384 --> 00:26:15,568
We, we did not have 10 years to build our world.

442
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:20,211
But these examples showed us the value of taking the time

443
00:26:20,892 --> 00:26:22,573
to create a world with depth

444
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:26,216
and to plan for any possible future storylines.

445
00:26:27,678 --> 00:26:29,519
So we invested our time.

446
00:26:32,936 --> 00:26:38,581
And Chris Alderson created storyboards that covered this story as well as future storylines.

447
00:26:39,402 --> 00:26:44,067
These were play-tested to help ensure that our story and characters would remain compelling

448
00:26:44,127 --> 00:26:52,116
throughout. And while none of us were professional writers, two of us wrote as a hobby.

449
00:26:53,497 --> 00:26:55,479
Tam Armstrong and Shauna Perry.

450
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:59,789
They created documents developing the history in rules and moths,

451
00:26:59,969 --> 00:27:03,192
and short stories to see if our world and rules

452
00:27:03,252 --> 00:27:05,374
were generative enough to create within.

453
00:27:07,115 --> 00:27:09,477
These were never going to go into game.

454
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:14,041
But they were a great source for quotes

455
00:27:14,161 --> 00:27:16,783
for last-minute marketing requests like cards,

456
00:27:17,384 --> 00:27:18,785
or for later in production

457
00:27:18,865 --> 00:27:21,708
when creativity might be running a little bit lower.

458
00:27:23,457 --> 00:27:27,940
We won't directly reveal everything that we developed for the world of Moss.

459
00:27:30,962 --> 00:27:33,823
But you see its influence reflected in its mystery.

460
00:27:36,425 --> 00:27:38,046
The unanswered questions.

461
00:27:41,728 --> 00:27:42,508
And the wonder.

462
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,091
Seen throughout it.

463
00:27:52,077 --> 00:27:53,339
With the world and story built,

464
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:54,921
the last thing was figuring out

465
00:27:55,181 --> 00:27:57,784
how to use virtual reality to deliver a story.

466
00:27:59,046 --> 00:27:59,967
As with our gameplay,

467
00:28:01,909 --> 00:28:04,512
we created a prototype so we could track production times

468
00:28:04,552 --> 00:28:05,533
for schedule estimates.

469
00:28:08,345 --> 00:28:10,325
This is still rough and unfinished,

470
00:28:10,465 --> 00:28:13,486
but being able to lean in and look around their small home

471
00:28:13,686 --> 00:28:16,307
and take in all the details was pretty immersive.

472
00:28:16,927 --> 00:28:19,248
Watching the two interact was really charming.

473
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:21,408
And there's a lot of personality that could be shown

474
00:28:21,528 --> 00:28:23,489
in Quill's excitement to show her uncle

475
00:28:23,529 --> 00:28:26,450
the treasure she's found from exploring the local forest,

476
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,190
or even like the subtle movements,

477
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,731
like the way Argus adjusts his glasses.

478
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:33,452
And VR meant we could do fun things

479
00:28:33,492 --> 00:28:36,593
like make characters react or look at you.

480
00:28:38,841 --> 00:28:42,062
This experiment showed us that watching a tiny stage play come

481
00:28:42,102 --> 00:28:44,803
alive in front of you really was as enchanting

482
00:28:44,843 --> 00:28:45,743
as we thought it would be.

483
00:28:45,763 --> 00:28:49,845
And the scene is much more immersive in virtual reality

484
00:28:50,285 --> 00:28:52,866
than it ever could be experienced flat

485
00:28:53,266 --> 00:28:54,166
on a screen like this.

486
00:28:57,848 --> 00:28:59,408
Creating this prototype cinematic

487
00:28:59,528 --> 00:29:01,829
taught us how creating sequences in VR

488
00:29:01,969 --> 00:29:04,430
differs from creating sequences in flat screen games.

489
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:06,811
The biggest difference?

490
00:29:09,317 --> 00:29:12,718
The in-game camera is now literally the player's head.

491
00:29:12,738 --> 00:29:18,340
A camera cut is teleporting the player around,

492
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,601
and a panning shot is like sending him

493
00:29:21,641 --> 00:29:22,481
flying through space.

494
00:29:23,541 --> 00:29:25,862
And you're probably making him sick in the process.

495
00:29:28,703 --> 00:29:31,403
Because of this, directing shots becomes

496
00:29:31,463 --> 00:29:33,304
directing the player's attention,

497
00:29:34,104 --> 00:29:36,505
getting them to look where you want them to look,

498
00:29:37,205 --> 00:29:38,705
when you want them to look there.

499
00:29:40,803 --> 00:29:43,504
Luckily, we found a few tricks to accomplish this.

500
00:29:44,444 --> 00:29:46,625
The first of which comes from another medium

501
00:29:46,665 --> 00:29:50,506
that can't use camera cuts or pans, theater plays.

502
00:29:53,787 --> 00:29:56,048
This scene uses stage lighting techniques.

503
00:29:57,008 --> 00:29:59,829
The house itself is a stage with the player watching

504
00:29:59,869 --> 00:30:01,269
from the darkened area of the room,

505
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,850
much like an audience watching a live play.

506
00:30:05,051 --> 00:30:07,311
By lighting where we want the players to look,

507
00:30:07,471 --> 00:30:09,732
we can effectively direct their attention.

508
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:17,382
Movement. If you toss a ball towards someone, you can see

509
00:30:17,402 --> 00:30:21,064
for yourself how well this works to grab a player's attention.

510
00:30:21,944 --> 00:30:25,286
Because movement draws attention to itself, it could also be used

511
00:30:25,426 --> 00:30:27,787
to direct a player's gaze around an environment.

512
00:30:29,508 --> 00:30:32,790
In this prototype cinematic, Argus suddenly runs upstairs,

513
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:35,972
his quick and unexpected movement grabbing attention

514
00:30:36,092 --> 00:30:38,573
and leading the player's eyes up the stairs

515
00:30:38,733 --> 00:30:39,734
and towards the library,

516
00:30:40,254 --> 00:30:42,095
and thus towards the book that he's grabbing.

517
00:30:46,126 --> 00:30:49,888
Color is a familiar attention director for any artist.

518
00:30:50,969 --> 00:30:54,030
Much in the same way a bright color can draw a viewer's eye

519
00:30:54,131 --> 00:30:55,291
to a section of an image,

520
00:30:55,731 --> 00:30:59,634
color can draw a player's eye to a section of an environment.

521
00:31:01,835 --> 00:31:04,857
In the cinematic, the cool, unnaturally vibrant blue

522
00:31:04,897 --> 00:31:07,138
of the relic pops against the warm,

523
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:08,699
fire-lit colors of the house.

524
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:14,553
This is why Quill's trademark bandana eventually becomes red instead of green.

525
00:31:15,493 --> 00:31:19,596
Red contrasted a lot nicer with the green that was in a lot of our environments.

526
00:31:23,463 --> 00:31:25,404
An earlier version of the prototype cinematic

527
00:31:25,764 --> 00:31:28,606
had the ambient sounds of a warm, crackling fire

528
00:31:28,626 --> 00:31:31,787
to help players feel how cozy and safe the home was.

529
00:31:32,828 --> 00:31:35,409
Playtesting this, we felt the volume of the audio

530
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:37,911
made players feel like the fireplace,

531
00:31:38,711 --> 00:31:39,852
it had to be important.

532
00:31:40,953 --> 00:31:42,473
So they focused in on this area

533
00:31:42,914 --> 00:31:44,414
to the point where they would miss out

534
00:31:44,454 --> 00:31:46,576
on the entire expensive cinematic

535
00:31:46,616 --> 00:31:48,117
that we had playing out in front of them.

536
00:31:50,078 --> 00:31:52,661
Audio, especially directional audio,

537
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:55,504
is a really effective attention director.

538
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:58,427
If you'd like to hear more on this,

539
00:31:58,747 --> 00:32:00,650
our audio director, Stephen Hottie,

540
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:04,374
has a GDC talk this year called Design Before Sound

541
00:32:04,514 --> 00:32:05,515
that is later on today.

542
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,681
The last is gaze detection.

543
00:32:11,517 --> 00:32:13,938
Originally, the cinematic started when the level loaded.

544
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:17,900
But what we found was a lot of people actually missed it

545
00:32:18,321 --> 00:32:19,641
because they had their heads set up

546
00:32:19,702 --> 00:32:21,182
to listen to playtest instructions

547
00:32:21,943 --> 00:32:25,225
or they were turned around taking in the environment.

548
00:32:26,846 --> 00:32:30,208
Basically, what we found was all the attention direction

549
00:32:30,328 --> 00:32:32,969
in the world won't help if your player's

550
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:33,770
not looking at them.

551
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:37,652
This is why it's really important to be able to tell

552
00:32:37,752 --> 00:32:38,913
where your player is looking.

553
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:45,299
That way, you can start up your animations and sequences confident that they can see them.

554
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:52,641
If you take a look here, you can see all these attention directions in action

555
00:32:53,021 --> 00:32:57,882
in this introduction cinematic for Quill. Notice how the butterfly's bright orange color

556
00:32:57,962 --> 00:33:00,423
and its movement direct your attention over to the tree.

557
00:33:01,314 --> 00:33:07,297
Once it lands, a glow and some directional audio draws your focus to the glass as it falls,

558
00:33:07,497 --> 00:33:11,300
bringing your eye line down to the same level as the bit of grass behind the tree.

559
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:16,903
The grass will make noise and shake until the gaze detection senses that you're looking at it,

560
00:33:17,444 --> 00:33:21,186
and if you aren't looking at it, you send the butterfly off to help draw your attention back

561
00:33:21,226 --> 00:33:27,230
to this area again. This makes sure that you don't miss when our hero, Quill, pops into frame.

562
00:33:28,413 --> 00:33:31,334
Here, you'll notice some lovely character animation from Rick

563
00:33:31,354 --> 00:33:33,255
that really showcases her personality.

564
00:33:33,275 --> 00:33:36,456
And we have a light shine on a key introduction moment,

565
00:33:36,976 --> 00:33:39,137
helping ensure that no one will miss it.

566
00:33:42,118 --> 00:33:44,039
So, exploration done, right?

567
00:33:44,579 --> 00:33:47,541
We had found the perfect delivery method for our story.

568
00:33:49,281 --> 00:33:52,703
Well, the downside to this method?

569
00:33:55,404 --> 00:33:57,425
Animations take a long time to create.

570
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:01,135
Our animator, Rick, has 18 years of experience,

571
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:04,017
and he's optimized his workflow to the point

572
00:34:04,057 --> 00:34:07,280
where he can create 10 to 15 seconds worth of animation

573
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:07,660
a day.

574
00:34:08,581 --> 00:34:09,941
With figuring out the pipeline, it

575
00:34:09,982 --> 00:34:13,524
took six weeks to create this three minute prototype

576
00:34:13,544 --> 00:34:14,064
cinematic.

577
00:34:16,126 --> 00:34:17,767
This time, it could be optimized,

578
00:34:18,167 --> 00:34:20,709
but Rick only had a three to four month window

579
00:34:20,829 --> 00:34:22,971
that he can spend on story animations.

580
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:27,476
Because of this, in-game cinematics were too expensive

581
00:34:27,616 --> 00:34:30,057
for anything other than key story moments.

582
00:34:32,439 --> 00:34:35,441
The typical solution would be to cut all the story moments

583
00:34:35,461 --> 00:34:36,742
that we couldn't afford to create.

584
00:34:39,063 --> 00:34:41,785
But while this isn't a major story moment,

585
00:34:42,285 --> 00:34:44,827
this scene is important because it serves two purposes.

586
00:34:45,807 --> 00:34:47,488
The first is it introduces Argus

587
00:34:47,748 --> 00:34:50,430
and it shows a close relationship that he shares with Quill.

588
00:34:51,855 --> 00:34:58,898
And this is vital, because our hero's incentive is to save a loved one.

589
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:03,880
The other thing the scene does is it introduces the glass, and

590
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,501
with Argus's reaction to it, it shows the glass's role within the world.

591
00:35:10,502 --> 00:35:12,143
This adds depth to our world.

592
00:35:13,668 --> 00:35:16,770
Argus reacts because of his past with the glass relic.

593
00:35:17,711 --> 00:35:20,072
This shows the central role that the glass has played

594
00:35:20,112 --> 00:35:22,093
in the events leading up to the game of Moss.

595
00:35:23,994 --> 00:35:26,335
So we have scenes that contribute

596
00:35:26,355 --> 00:35:27,676
to our story's narrative goals,

597
00:35:28,396 --> 00:35:31,258
but we cannot afford to create the in-game cinematics

598
00:35:31,318 --> 00:35:32,238
associated with them.

599
00:35:33,879 --> 00:35:35,840
How can we deliver our story in a way

600
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,602
where it won't cheapen the player's experience,

601
00:35:38,782 --> 00:35:40,223
but it's cheaper to create?

602
00:35:43,348 --> 00:35:46,651
To solve this, we look to our gameplay prototype.

603
00:35:49,012 --> 00:35:52,074
Very early ideas for the game had the player spending their

604
00:35:52,114 --> 00:35:55,196
whole time in the library, reaching through the book to

605
00:35:55,256 --> 00:35:59,299
interact with the world the moss. As polyar playtest in

606
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:03,642
prototype, the gameplay pivoted away from this idea. But the

607
00:36:03,682 --> 00:36:05,263
book itself remained.

608
00:36:05,283 --> 00:36:10,406
The art style for the book was inspired by other media that

609
00:36:10,526 --> 00:36:12,508
used a book as his introduction and end.

610
00:36:14,628 --> 00:36:15,849
Disney's Sleeping Beauty.

611
00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:19,150
The film starts with video of a real book opening up.

612
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:22,071
And the backstory of the world is told

613
00:36:22,111 --> 00:36:23,472
through its text and images.

614
00:36:26,033 --> 00:36:28,394
Until a zoom into the book illustration

615
00:36:28,474 --> 00:36:32,595
takes the viewer into the world of the animated film.

616
00:36:33,676 --> 00:36:35,836
This fit perfectly with what we were trying to do.

617
00:36:39,211 --> 00:36:42,753
And the art style worked great with our small animals and armor theme.

618
00:36:43,474 --> 00:36:47,516
Playtesters found that the book format was really appealing and charming

619
00:36:47,536 --> 00:36:50,058
because it made them feel like they were entering a fairy tale.

620
00:36:51,619 --> 00:36:55,642
This book seemed like a great way to bring more story moments into our game.

621
00:37:00,204 --> 00:37:01,705
But what about our pillars?

622
00:37:03,827 --> 00:37:06,288
Specifically, the one about an extraordinary world.

623
00:37:07,828 --> 00:37:13,411
How do we take something as ordinary as reading a book and make it feel like something special?

624
00:37:16,292 --> 00:37:20,654
Our first thought was, well, what if the images in the book moved?

625
00:37:23,296 --> 00:37:26,998
Our animator, Rick, experimented with 2D animations.

626
00:37:27,758 --> 00:37:32,120
He loves Frank and Ollie's style, so he went for the loose, sketchy feel of Disney's Jungle Book.

627
00:37:33,269 --> 00:37:35,670
With this, we could use drawings for both the story

628
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:38,351
and save animations for the important moments.

629
00:37:40,531 --> 00:37:44,192
To create this, Rick started by animating the scene in 3D.

630
00:37:45,533 --> 00:37:48,334
He then sketched over printouts at 15 FPS

631
00:37:48,454 --> 00:37:50,774
and scanned them into Photoshop for a quick color pass.

632
00:37:51,835 --> 00:37:54,976
The entire process took three days for this two-second clip.

633
00:37:56,296 --> 00:37:58,017
We probably could have made this more efficient,

634
00:37:58,597 --> 00:38:01,418
but it still showed that this method could be a risk.

635
00:38:02,384 --> 00:38:05,885
And also, I had concerns that the style and feel of this

636
00:38:05,965 --> 00:38:07,786
didn't quite match the rest of our game.

637
00:38:10,627 --> 00:38:13,829
For the next exploration, I created a simple looping

638
00:38:13,889 --> 00:38:15,810
flipbook animation in the book's material.

639
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,591
With ambient animations like this,

640
00:38:18,911 --> 00:38:21,272
even a non-animator like myself could help

641
00:38:21,352 --> 00:38:23,133
add some magic to the pages.

642
00:38:24,954 --> 00:38:27,235
This test, as simple as it was, helped

643
00:38:27,275 --> 00:38:30,836
confirm that it was cool to see images moving on the page.

644
00:38:34,117 --> 00:38:37,600
And this simple technique worked great to bring pages to life in the game.

645
00:38:38,961 --> 00:38:42,363
Except if we wanted to build an emotional connection with players,

646
00:38:42,924 --> 00:38:46,286
we probably wanted some way of animating our characters.

647
00:38:48,148 --> 00:38:52,111
Could we do this without requiring too much work from our one animator?

648
00:38:52,131 --> 00:38:58,335
Around this time, I watched some tutorials on scene captures.

649
00:38:59,605 --> 00:39:03,406
A scene capture is a camera that records a scene onto a texture,

650
00:39:03,747 --> 00:39:05,007
which is then used in a material.

651
00:39:05,767 --> 00:39:08,749
Normally, this is used for things like mirror reflections.

652
00:39:09,509 --> 00:39:11,190
But this got me thinking.

653
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:14,811
Could this be the solution that we're looking for?

654
00:39:17,993 --> 00:39:19,694
This led to my next experiment.

655
00:39:20,474 --> 00:39:22,695
On the lower left hand corner of the left page,

656
00:39:23,335 --> 00:39:26,056
you can see my test in the idle movement of the mouse soldier.

657
00:39:27,145 --> 00:39:29,185
I was going for a moving concept art look

658
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:31,646
that could be animated without animation support.

659
00:39:34,267 --> 00:39:35,827
By cutting out the existing image

660
00:39:35,887 --> 00:39:38,448
and separating them out onto different planes of geometry,

661
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,808
we could animate a character like this one,

662
00:39:40,908 --> 00:39:42,329
like you would a shadow puppet.

663
00:39:43,709 --> 00:39:45,950
And the art style of this matched the visuals

664
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:47,050
of the rest of our game.

665
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:51,071
However, its movement did not.

666
00:39:52,855 --> 00:39:56,537
Animation worried that this method couldn't support the fidelity needed

667
00:39:56,637 --> 00:40:00,420
for a performance that players could feel emotionally connected to.

668
00:40:02,581 --> 00:40:05,343
So I had to figure out a way to deliver our story

669
00:40:05,984 --> 00:40:09,906
with the high animation quality bar set everywhere else in the game.

670
00:40:11,287 --> 00:40:14,329
But I had to do this without overburdening animation.

671
00:40:16,071 --> 00:40:17,311
Like, how could I do this?

672
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:25,072
With the realization that if the scene capture could record a model like this one,

673
00:40:26,852 --> 00:40:29,373
I could use it to record our in-game models as well.

674
00:40:30,253 --> 00:40:33,915
This meant I could reuse any existing animation for the book

675
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:36,775
and save custom animations for key moments.

676
00:40:37,916 --> 00:40:40,377
Even for pages without animations, it helped

677
00:40:41,057 --> 00:40:44,378
because I could use these poses as a starting point for the illustrations.

678
00:40:47,082 --> 00:40:51,343
Not only that, but we could use screenshots of our in-game levels, like this one here,

679
00:40:51,843 --> 00:40:54,023
as a starting point for the book's illustrations.

680
00:40:56,284 --> 00:41:00,165
By painting over these, we could help ensure that the locations in the book would match

681
00:41:00,225 --> 00:41:01,665
up with their in-game locations.

682
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:06,486
This also made it quick and easy to try out different camera angles or shots to see what

683
00:41:06,526 --> 00:41:08,267
would best sell a story moment.

684
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,520
Scene captures, they're expensive.

685
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,561
So we optimized the models used in our book.

686
00:41:18,921 --> 00:41:21,022
This is actually an unlit model.

687
00:41:22,162 --> 00:41:25,884
Developer Chad Taylor created a material that fakes lighting.

688
00:41:26,864 --> 00:41:28,424
In addition to being super cheap,

689
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,745
it helps add a painterly look to our characters.

690
00:41:31,926 --> 00:41:33,006
This helps integrate them

691
00:41:33,086 --> 00:41:34,626
into the painted backgrounds of the book.

692
00:41:36,197 --> 00:41:38,879
And if you're wondering to yourself, wait, wait a moment.

693
00:41:38,979 --> 00:41:41,500
Does that mean when I'm in the library reading the book,

694
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,322
that somewhere out in space, there's a whole bunch of models animating

695
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:47,043
and being recorded by some camera?

696
00:41:48,864 --> 00:41:49,684
The answer is yes.

697
00:41:50,744 --> 00:41:51,525
Yes, it does.

698
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:55,567
You will actually get a slight performance hit from this

699
00:41:55,687 --> 00:41:59,209
if you turn all the way around from the book and face the wall behind you.

700
00:42:00,174 --> 00:42:03,317
But so far, nobody has noticed or complained.

701
00:42:04,177 --> 00:42:06,499
So I think we got away with this one.

702
00:42:10,343 --> 00:42:12,465
With our visuals figured out, the next challenge

703
00:42:12,485 --> 00:42:15,007
was how to deliver the written parts of our story.

704
00:42:18,231 --> 00:42:20,673
Our gameplay prototype had the words incorporated

705
00:42:20,693 --> 00:42:21,994
into the images themselves.

706
00:42:23,255 --> 00:42:23,796
This works.

707
00:42:24,194 --> 00:42:28,498
But our goal of accessibility meant we wanted to support as many languages as possible.

708
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:32,142
And incorporating the text for all these different languages

709
00:42:32,722 --> 00:42:35,845
would have been a nightmare for art and a lot to maintain.

710
00:42:37,066 --> 00:42:39,809
We could have just used subtitles, but the thought was

711
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:44,113
a narrator could add a lot to our childhood fairy tale vibes.

712
00:42:46,742 --> 00:42:49,063
Luckily, our audio director, Stephen Hoddy,

713
00:42:49,243 --> 00:42:52,164
had worked with a talented voice actor on Destiny of the Taken

714
00:42:52,204 --> 00:42:55,665
King, and he knew that Morla had the range

715
00:42:55,685 --> 00:42:56,565
to pull off this role.

716
00:42:57,885 --> 00:43:01,086
And personally, I was kind of excited to work

717
00:43:01,126 --> 00:43:03,467
with the voice actor of a character I created again.

718
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:04,667
So that was cool.

719
00:43:06,348 --> 00:43:08,788
Out past the bell again, he scolded.

720
00:43:09,489 --> 00:43:11,449
Quill, I've told you countless times.

721
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:12,950
I know.

722
00:43:13,704 --> 00:43:17,185
Quill replied, crestfallen, I didn't mean to worry you.

723
00:43:19,745 --> 00:43:24,386
A narrator, meant one voice actor, played the role of all six of our characters.

724
00:43:25,926 --> 00:43:30,307
One voice doing multiple voices as charmed players by reminding him

725
00:43:30,347 --> 00:43:34,588
of fond, nostalgic memories of being read bedtime stories as a child.

726
00:43:36,248 --> 00:43:38,349
In fact, Marla prepared for the role

727
00:43:38,769 --> 00:43:42,690
by reading our story to her son as an actual bedtime story.

728
00:43:45,008 --> 00:43:46,749
With the narration for the book figured out,

729
00:43:47,069 --> 00:43:48,590
we moved on to play testing.

730
00:43:51,531 --> 00:43:54,553
We discovered players would be so overwhelmed

731
00:43:54,593 --> 00:43:57,054
with the experience of being transported to the library

732
00:43:57,514 --> 00:43:58,935
that they wanted to look around

733
00:43:58,995 --> 00:44:01,996
and take the time to adjust to their new environment.

734
00:44:02,596 --> 00:44:04,877
They wouldn't notice that there was a book in front of them

735
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:05,718
to interact with,

736
00:44:05,878 --> 00:44:08,699
or that a narrator had started reading them the story.

737
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,381
Basically, we found that even when using

738
00:44:13,441 --> 00:44:14,501
a simple book format.

739
00:44:15,218 --> 00:44:18,279
Effectively directing the player's attention is important

740
00:44:18,399 --> 00:44:21,319
to make sure that they can see what you're trying to show them.

741
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,981
The first thing we did was add an interactive glow

742
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:28,661
that lit up whenever the hand was near.

743
00:44:29,481 --> 00:44:32,162
Subtle directional audio was added to this glow.

744
00:44:32,682 --> 00:44:34,162
This made the book feel magical

745
00:44:34,322 --> 00:44:37,003
and encouraged players to try interacting with it.

746
00:44:39,625 --> 00:44:44,548
Next, we added a gaze target so we could tell when players looked at the book.

747
00:44:45,208 --> 00:44:49,650
This let the player take all the time they wanted to look around the environment or get settled in.

748
00:44:50,391 --> 00:44:54,353
The story would only start when they looked at the page so they wouldn't miss it.

749
00:44:57,574 --> 00:45:00,196
The glow on the cover was added to the pages.

750
00:45:01,116 --> 00:45:05,178
The page borders glowed to let players know which page the narrator was referring to

751
00:45:06,219 --> 00:45:08,120
and then pulsed when she was done talking.

752
00:45:09,316 --> 00:45:11,478
This worked great with simple test pages.

753
00:45:13,639 --> 00:45:16,842
Yet, as we added more images and animations to the book,

754
00:45:17,322 --> 00:45:18,763
playtest showed that players started

755
00:45:18,783 --> 00:45:20,344
to be distracted by the visuals.

756
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:22,906
They stopped noticing when the trim glowed.

757
00:45:23,767 --> 00:45:25,729
People began turning the pages to early

758
00:45:25,749 --> 00:45:28,190
and could no longer figure out which page

759
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:29,712
the narrator was referring to.

760
00:45:32,394 --> 00:45:35,396
What we found was the more complexity there is,

761
00:45:36,237 --> 00:45:38,478
the more attention direction that is needed.

762
00:45:41,645 --> 00:45:44,688
We fixed this by darkening and desaturing the images

763
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:46,589
that the narrator was not talking about.

764
00:45:47,329 --> 00:45:50,512
The color and vibrancy of the active page made it clear

765
00:45:50,712 --> 00:45:52,673
which page the narrator was referring to.

766
00:45:55,956 --> 00:45:58,617
Next was controlling when animations played in the book.

767
00:45:59,198 --> 00:46:02,420
By making sure any ambient or character animations only played

768
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,601
when that page was active,

769
00:46:04,321 --> 00:46:07,704
we knew movement could no longer distract the player's focus.

770
00:46:08,882 --> 00:46:11,103
With this additional attention direction,

771
00:46:11,263 --> 00:46:14,506
playtest went smoothly and players knew when to turn the page

772
00:46:14,966 --> 00:46:16,928
and which page the narrator was referring to.

773
00:46:16,948 --> 00:46:20,350
We were free to experiment with other ways

774
00:46:20,891 --> 00:46:23,913
we can make the book experience feel even more enchanting.

775
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:30,238
Like adding a subtle ink effect to the fade in of the images

776
00:46:30,718 --> 00:46:32,279
so it felt like the book was being written

777
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,480
as you're reading it.

778
00:46:36,357 --> 00:46:38,138
And VR meant we could do fun things,

779
00:46:38,218 --> 00:46:40,238
like having book characters point at you

780
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:41,979
and follow you around as you move.

781
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:49,861
Or let players see themselves reflected in his pages,

782
00:46:50,401 --> 00:46:52,601
drawing them even further into our story.

783
00:46:53,782 --> 00:46:56,082
With virtual reality, we could do things with the book

784
00:46:56,162 --> 00:46:57,723
that couldn't be done in real life.

785
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:00,604
However, that doesn't mean

786
00:47:00,644 --> 00:47:02,184
that the book was a perfect solution.

787
00:47:03,573 --> 00:47:06,614
We learned too late that we needed gameplay systems in place

788
00:47:06,734 --> 00:47:08,915
so Quill would react in a way that made sense

789
00:47:08,995 --> 00:47:10,735
with what just had happened in the book.

790
00:47:13,396 --> 00:47:15,297
In this let's play by Salsa Ketchup,

791
00:47:15,957 --> 00:47:17,057
the player has just gone through

792
00:47:17,097 --> 00:47:19,138
a very emotional chapter with Quill.

793
00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:26,720
Her first chance to take out Saurthog

794
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,901
ends with her ally sacrificing himself to save her.

795
00:47:32,702 --> 00:47:34,943
All she could do is run for her life.

796
00:47:35,823 --> 00:47:38,245
She has failed, and her friend is gone.

797
00:47:39,405 --> 00:47:41,907
Alone and hopeless, Quill wants to give up,

798
00:47:43,067 --> 00:47:46,989
until a gentle touch on her shoulder reminds her that you,

799
00:47:47,209 --> 00:47:49,150
the reader, still believe in her.

800
00:47:52,812 --> 00:47:54,533
After a heartfelt plea from Quill,

801
00:47:54,733 --> 00:47:57,375
you can see the player wipe tears from his eyes.

802
00:47:59,116 --> 00:48:01,477
He goes to pet his dear companion to comfort her.

803
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:05,693
and basically ends up getting waved away.

804
00:48:05,713 --> 00:48:09,215
Attempt to wave to her also disappoints.

805
00:48:10,056 --> 00:48:11,417
All the gameplay systems knew

806
00:48:11,577 --> 00:48:13,398
was that there's an enemy in the next room,

807
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:15,419
so she's actually in combat mode here.

808
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,042
This could have been a great immersive bonding experience,

809
00:48:20,203 --> 00:48:22,344
and to be honest, watching this lost potential

810
00:48:22,464 --> 00:48:23,705
was a little hard for us.

811
00:48:27,631 --> 00:48:33,193
However, the biggest downside to the book was how much less impactful moments like this felt like.

812
00:48:34,873 --> 00:48:37,474
My friend, I need your help.

813
00:48:39,135 --> 00:48:42,536
If we don't face our fault now, my uncle will die.

814
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:50,338
Moments like this felt much more amazing outside the book.

815
00:48:50,818 --> 00:48:53,339
With no layer of removal, you're right in the middle of it.

816
00:48:53,739 --> 00:48:56,500
The story happens epically right in front of you.

817
00:48:58,664 --> 00:49:03,306
Yet, with all this said, we're able to deliver a game that we could be proud of.

818
00:49:04,427 --> 00:49:08,009
One that accomplished our narrative goals within the constraints of our production,

819
00:49:08,029 --> 00:49:11,390
and all without killing one animator.

820
00:49:13,331 --> 00:49:16,473
By exploring options, we're able to spread out the workflow

821
00:49:17,453 --> 00:49:20,075
and find creative solutions for these challenges.

822
00:49:23,828 --> 00:49:26,992
To summarize, we did not start with the story

823
00:49:27,473 --> 00:49:29,315
when trying to figure out a game's narrative.

824
00:49:31,138 --> 00:49:33,140
We started with understanding the medium

825
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:36,385
that we were developing for and using that understanding

826
00:49:36,445 --> 00:49:39,228
to design characters that take full advantage

827
00:49:39,329 --> 00:49:40,530
of the strengths of our medium.

828
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:45,575
We then use these characters and gameplay

829
00:49:45,655 --> 00:49:47,637
to help craft our world and story,

830
00:49:48,217 --> 00:49:50,699
making sure to take the time to create a world with depth

831
00:49:50,939 --> 00:49:53,581
and plan for any possible future storylines.

832
00:49:56,424 --> 00:49:58,885
Then finally experimenting with creative ways

833
00:49:58,945 --> 00:49:59,966
to tell our story,

834
00:50:00,607 --> 00:50:02,728
the ones that fit our production constraints

835
00:50:02,888 --> 00:50:04,570
while adding to the appeal of our game

836
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:06,691
and taking full advantage

837
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:09,173
of the unique possibilities of our medium.

838
00:50:12,712 --> 00:50:14,694
We did all this with the help of Deere.

839
00:50:17,577 --> 00:50:20,140
Deere ensured that we started with the question of

840
00:50:21,102 --> 00:50:22,824
how to even make a good VR game.

841
00:50:23,985 --> 00:50:27,169
From there, we moved on to making sure that we're taking

842
00:50:27,389 --> 00:50:30,533
our team's strengths and our production's constraints

843
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:31,554
into consideration.

844
00:50:33,215 --> 00:50:37,617
We experimented and explored and made sure to review with playtesting,

845
00:50:38,637 --> 00:50:41,939
which made sure our decisions were fact-based instead of subjective,

846
00:50:42,399 --> 00:50:47,181
and which ensured that we weren't following any assumptions that could lead us astray.

847
00:50:49,323 --> 00:50:52,264
These basic principles can be applied to any medium.

848
00:50:53,765 --> 00:50:57,527
And we are lucky enough to live in a time where with

849
00:50:58,219 --> 00:51:05,748
AR, MR, and VR, there are multiple cutting-edge mediums full of unexplored potential, still

850
00:51:05,848 --> 00:51:08,391
at their early 8-bit days.

851
00:51:08,411 --> 00:51:15,419
I mean, we had no idea that our game could have this effect on people.

852
00:51:18,176 --> 00:51:20,698
I have been in the games industry for over eight years,

853
00:51:21,479 --> 00:51:23,080
and this is the first game I've worked on

854
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:26,143
that has caused people, multiple people,

855
00:51:26,323 --> 00:51:27,944
to burst into tears of joy.

856
00:51:27,964 --> 00:51:34,490
I have seen the toughest looking men break into a smile

857
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:36,411
full of childlike wonder and joy

858
00:51:36,431 --> 00:51:37,752
the first time they meet Quill.

859
00:51:39,714 --> 00:51:42,396
And we've gotten a lot of heartfelt messages from fans.

860
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:47,080
There is just so much.

861
00:51:58,604 --> 00:52:01,746
And people feel so connected to our little hero.

862
00:52:03,666 --> 00:52:05,787
None of us knew what type of game we were making

863
00:52:05,907 --> 00:52:07,208
when we first started production.

864
00:52:08,128 --> 00:52:10,590
If we had followed the assumptions of flat screen games,

865
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:14,151
there is no way that anyone would have thought

866
00:52:14,191 --> 00:52:16,552
making a game where you play a supportive character

867
00:52:16,912 --> 00:52:19,334
to a tiny swordswoman mouse was a good idea.

868
00:52:19,354 --> 00:52:22,375
And this is why

869
00:52:23,694 --> 00:52:29,117
I am so excited to be here at GDC, surrounded by so many talented developers.

870
00:52:30,697 --> 00:52:34,059
With all of these new mediums, who knows what's possible?

871
00:52:35,499 --> 00:52:38,741
I hope you take some of what you learn here to do your own experiments,

872
00:52:39,461 --> 00:52:42,062
free from any preconceptions or assumptions,

873
00:52:42,162 --> 00:52:44,884
to see what exciting things that you can discover.

874
00:52:47,465 --> 00:52:51,447
I can't wait to see what engaging stories you all come up with.

875
00:52:55,437 --> 00:52:57,869
This has been my postmortem on the storytelling of Moss.

876
00:52:58,432 --> 00:52:59,999
Thank you all so much for listening.

877
00:53:13,572 --> 00:53:18,274
I'd like to take a quick moment, a big thank you to the entire team of PolyArch and my

878
00:53:18,314 --> 00:53:19,495
advisor Amy Hanig.

879
00:53:20,695 --> 00:53:25,177
This was my first ever talk at a conference, so I'm very grateful to have had everybody's

880
00:53:25,598 --> 00:53:26,338
help and advice.

881
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:33,001
And a small plug for our other GDC talks this year, audio director Stephen Hottie will be

882
00:53:33,041 --> 00:53:37,523
going over the sound design of Moss later on today, and our composer Jason Graves had

883
00:53:37,563 --> 00:53:39,864
a talk going over the music of Moss yesterday.

884
00:53:41,504 --> 00:53:45,566
And we have six minutes, so I could take any questions

885
00:53:45,606 --> 00:53:46,567
if anyone has any.

886
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:52,951
Congratulations on your first talk.

887
00:53:53,371 --> 00:53:53,891
That was great.

888
00:53:53,911 --> 00:53:54,852
Thanks.

889
00:53:55,092 --> 00:53:57,313
You talked a lot about how you discovered

890
00:53:57,333 --> 00:53:58,374
these things through playtest.

891
00:53:58,754 --> 00:54:02,296
Did you, how formal and structured were your playtests?

892
00:54:02,336 --> 00:54:03,477
You have informal playtests.

893
00:54:04,097 --> 00:54:05,918
Formal ones, how did you collect the data?

894
00:54:05,938 --> 00:54:07,820
I'd be interested to hear about that.

895
00:54:08,184 --> 00:54:09,267
Oh, that's a great question.

896
00:54:09,848 --> 00:54:12,314
The question was about our play tests, the structure of them,

897
00:54:12,394 --> 00:54:13,397
and how formal they were.

898
00:54:15,742 --> 00:54:17,863
Basically, a small team of 15, right?

899
00:54:17,943 --> 00:54:20,804
So, we did a lot of internal playtesting,

900
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:24,806
where near the end, like, there were departments

901
00:54:24,866 --> 00:54:26,166
that had less work near the end,

902
00:54:26,226 --> 00:54:29,528
so they spent their entire time obsessively playing the game

903
00:54:31,088 --> 00:54:33,329
and seeing who could get, like, the fastest times.

904
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:37,511
And then other than that, we also invited people

905
00:54:37,631 --> 00:54:38,852
in to playtest the game.

906
00:54:39,112 --> 00:54:42,393
And because we're so small, we just did friends and family.

907
00:54:43,714 --> 00:54:48,037
We just made an effort to make sure that we're constantly doing it during production.

908
00:54:48,697 --> 00:54:50,859
But other than that, it wasn't more structured than that.

909
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,341
Thanks, great question.

910
00:54:54,642 --> 00:54:57,244
Hi, thanks for your talk. Excellent game.

911
00:54:57,804 --> 00:55:04,789
I just wanted to ask about if you could talk about your decision to split the initial meeting of Sarlog

912
00:55:04,809 --> 00:55:09,053
with the confrontation later on and having that chapter in the middle.

913
00:55:11,277 --> 00:55:14,839
I was a little surprised to kind of see that violation of the show don't tell.

914
00:55:16,701 --> 00:55:19,282
So interesting.

915
00:55:19,502 --> 00:55:19,783
Okay.

916
00:55:19,943 --> 00:55:27,068
The question was why we decided to show Sarfag earlier before the big confrontation.

917
00:55:27,088 --> 00:55:34,833
And I can say that the writing team, like no professional writers, right?

918
00:55:35,557 --> 00:55:38,438
So what we did was we actually did a whole bunch of research

919
00:55:38,518 --> 00:55:40,279
into how to write a good story.

920
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:46,161
And we also looked a lot at common story structures

921
00:55:46,281 --> 00:55:49,483
and the structures of how to make an engaging story.

922
00:55:49,583 --> 00:55:53,104
And one of those is looking at the classic hero's journey.

923
00:55:54,705 --> 00:55:58,087
And so basically, the reason why we decided to do that

924
00:55:58,167 --> 00:56:00,848
was our research into story structure showed us

925
00:56:00,888 --> 00:56:02,689
that that would go really well,

926
00:56:02,749 --> 00:56:04,670
that the hero had to meet a low point.

927
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:12,511
before that it she takes on her greatest challenge and overcomes it so that was why the decision was and it just kind of

928
00:56:13,111 --> 00:56:16,312
Raises the stakes and makes our fog even more intimidating. So

929
00:56:17,092 --> 00:56:20,233
okay, I was just wondering you know, why the

930
00:56:20,833 --> 00:56:26,954
Player didn't have the character escaping which I was kind of thankful for that gets really intense at the end of that chapter

931
00:56:27,054 --> 00:56:28,034
So thank you for your answer

932
00:56:31,697 --> 00:56:33,858
Yeah, I think I echo a lot of the audience.

933
00:56:33,878 --> 00:56:36,900
This is a great talk and I think you knocked it out of the park.

934
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,002
So my question is on reflecting on this.

935
00:56:41,042 --> 00:56:43,924
I think a lot of this is postmortem reflection, right?

936
00:56:43,964 --> 00:56:48,707
But was there a few assumptions that were super challenged

937
00:56:48,847 --> 00:56:52,169
and some people really wanted this to happen that just really

938
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:54,531
completely fell apart once you play tested?

939
00:56:55,521 --> 00:57:02,005
Okay, so the question is what assumptions did people feel really strongly about that fell apart during playtesting?

940
00:57:05,147 --> 00:57:11,031
I do know, well, this is slightly different than what you're asking, but I do know

941
00:57:11,532 --> 00:57:15,815
we weren't expecting people to feel so connected to the hero, so that wasn't an assumption,

942
00:57:15,855 --> 00:57:22,119
but it was something that kind of caught us by surprise, yeah, from playtesting. And then a lot of it was...

943
00:57:23,742 --> 00:57:31,328
I mentioned it briefly, but the original idea for the game was you open a book and you interact

944
00:57:31,368 --> 00:57:34,751
through a world, through the book, and then you're in the library the whole time.

945
00:57:35,371 --> 00:57:40,315
So we actually went through a whole bunch of different ideas and we just kept pivoting

946
00:57:41,356 --> 00:57:43,017
based off of feedback from playtests.

947
00:57:43,577 --> 00:57:45,439
And the great thing about playtests is it...

948
00:57:47,195 --> 00:57:49,077
if there are disagreements in the studio at all,

949
00:57:49,298 --> 00:57:51,260
it makes it really easy to deal with them,

950
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,822
because then the decision isn't subjective.

951
00:57:53,862 --> 00:57:56,365
It's not like, I feel this is the right thing,

952
00:57:56,385 --> 00:57:57,066
so we're doing this.

953
00:57:57,326 --> 00:57:59,668
It's, hey, the data and facts show

954
00:57:59,708 --> 00:58:01,690
that this isn't as important as we thought it was.

955
00:58:02,271 --> 00:58:03,552
We should move on to the next thing.

956
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:05,214
So that's, yeah.

957
00:58:05,494 --> 00:58:07,435
Maybe as a follow-up to that, just real quick,

958
00:58:07,675 --> 00:58:11,718
how could you fit a lot of that loop going through assumption,

959
00:58:11,778 --> 00:58:14,099
build, prototype, playtest?

960
00:58:14,579 --> 00:58:17,281
That seems like a long loop to fit in an 18-month cycle.

961
00:58:17,321 --> 00:58:20,042
So did you have something unique?

962
00:58:20,182 --> 00:58:23,024
Or how did you tackle going through those iterative cycles

963
00:58:23,404 --> 00:58:24,885
with such a tight schedule?

964
00:58:27,326 --> 00:58:30,488
Basically, with the prototyping and playtesting,

965
00:58:30,648 --> 00:58:32,769
just making really rough versions of the game

966
00:58:33,069 --> 00:58:33,850
and testing it out.

967
00:58:35,493 --> 00:58:42,415
And we had, I think, yeah, that's basically how it is.

968
00:58:42,475 --> 00:58:43,496
We started really simple.

969
00:58:43,676 --> 00:58:48,557
And even from when it was just a vague story,

970
00:58:48,697 --> 00:58:51,138
like even when it was just words,

971
00:58:51,178 --> 00:58:53,338
we were testing that out and play testing with people.

972
00:58:53,518 --> 00:58:57,299
So very early on, every stage we were.

973
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,600
And it does take a while, but I think

974
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:01,820
the game is stronger for it.

975
00:59:02,601 --> 00:59:02,781
Cool.

976
00:59:02,841 --> 00:59:03,161
Thank you.

977
00:59:03,521 --> 00:59:03,821
Thank you.

978
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:08,983
I really loved the talk and I loved the animations in MOS and I was surprised to learn there

979
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:10,183
was only one animator.

980
00:59:10,984 --> 00:59:16,427
My question is, did you guys consider using mocap data and cleaning up mocap data to make

981
00:59:16,568 --> 00:59:20,150
cheaper animations as opposed to like hand keyframe animations?

982
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:26,674
So the question is if we considered using mocap to help with our one animator.

983
00:59:27,455 --> 00:59:27,675
And so...

984
00:59:28,817 --> 00:59:31,820
The answer is like, we had a very small budget.

985
00:59:32,401 --> 00:59:36,265
Well, there's like a lot of mocap, I was referring to like mocap libraries and...

986
00:59:36,786 --> 00:59:38,027
Oh, mocap libraries and stuff.

987
00:59:38,047 --> 00:59:38,948
Doing your own mocap.

988
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:44,715
So we actually have looked into that before, and the thing is, the interesting thing is,

989
00:59:44,735 --> 00:59:46,097
because cool is a mouse, right?

990
00:59:46,737 --> 00:59:48,239
And what we found is if you put...

991
00:59:49,722 --> 00:59:55,105
mocap date on her, she instantly looks like someone in a mouse costume instead of actually

992
00:59:55,145 --> 00:59:55,505
a mouse.

993
00:59:56,486 --> 01:00:04,210
So yeah, and it was just so important to the game that people be able to relate to her

994
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:06,551
and stuff, and that's why we want the keyframe now.

995
01:00:06,571 --> 01:00:09,173
Oh, I guess until they invent mouse mocap, we'll have to do it hand-painted.

996
01:00:09,213 --> 01:00:09,653
Yeah, yeah.

997
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:11,654
Thanks.

998
01:00:13,415 --> 01:00:13,655
Cool.

999
01:00:14,315 --> 01:00:14,475
Sweet.

1000
01:00:15,676 --> 01:00:15,716
So.

1001
01:00:15,736 --> 01:00:16,576
Thank you.

1002
01:00:17,984 --> 01:00:20,290
Well, that's all the time, but I'll be hanging out

1003
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:22,335
in the hallway if you wanna talk or anything, so.

1004
01:00:22,595 --> 01:00:22,956
Thank you.

1005
01:00:22,976 --> 01:00:24,159
Thank you.
