1
00:00:07,568 --> 00:00:09,849
Hi, so we're going to get started.

2
00:00:09,849 --> 00:00:14,271
Everybody ready?

3
00:00:14,271 --> 00:00:16,431
All right.

4
00:00:16,431 --> 00:00:19,372
All right, so hopefully you guys are all in the right location.

5
00:00:19,372 --> 00:00:22,494
Our presentation today is Marketing Indie Style.

6
00:00:22,494 --> 00:00:25,374
And why don't you introduce yourselves?

7
00:00:25,374 --> 00:00:26,915
My name is Justin Woodward.

8
00:00:26,915 --> 00:00:30,116
I am the founder and creative director

9
00:00:30,116 --> 00:00:31,457
at Interrobang Entertainment.

10
00:00:31,457 --> 00:00:33,957
I'm also a part-time marketer.

11
00:00:33,957 --> 00:00:36,378
And I help to co-found The Mix.

12
00:00:37,336 --> 00:00:39,013
The Media in the Exchange.

13
00:00:40,234 --> 00:00:42,336
And we'll talk a little bit about what the Media India

14
00:00:42,336 --> 00:00:44,737
Exchange is during our presentation today.

15
00:00:44,737 --> 00:00:45,858
My name is Joel Dreskin.

16
00:00:45,858 --> 00:00:47,319
I'm an independent marketer.

17
00:00:47,319 --> 00:00:49,501
I work with Justin on the Mix, which

18
00:00:49,501 --> 00:00:50,882
we will tell you a little bit about as sort

19
00:00:50,882 --> 00:00:53,363
of a piece of our presentation.

20
00:00:53,363 --> 00:00:56,706
And I'm just finishing up a book on indie game marketing, which

21
00:00:56,706 --> 00:00:58,367
is going to be coming out later this year.

22
00:00:58,367 --> 00:01:00,569
There's a link at the end of the presentation

23
00:01:00,569 --> 00:01:03,931
with more information about Justin and myself

24
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:05,812
and where you can get more information on some

25
00:01:05,812 --> 00:01:07,273
of the things we talked about today.

26
00:01:09,428 --> 00:01:13,390
So for today's presentation, we've

27
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,250
got two different perspectives.

28
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,671
My background is in marketing.

29
00:01:16,671 --> 00:01:19,972
I've done product marketing for LucasArts.

30
00:01:19,972 --> 00:01:22,213
I did work with Telltale from their second

31
00:01:22,213 --> 00:01:23,654
through their seventh year.

32
00:01:23,654 --> 00:01:25,215
I've worked in tech and other different places.

33
00:01:25,215 --> 00:01:29,156
So I come to this, and I do work now for Indies,

34
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:31,097
helping them with their marketing programs.

35
00:01:31,097 --> 00:01:32,858
So I bring that perspective to the presentation.

36
00:01:32,858 --> 00:01:34,919
And then Justin's going to talk about.

37
00:01:35,199 --> 00:01:42,064
how this all affects him is he's working as an indie game developer and other things that he does as well.

38
00:01:42,064 --> 00:01:47,128
And we'll also talk about how our experiences have come together in different ways and sort of intersected and overlapped.

39
00:01:47,128 --> 00:01:53,472
So let's start with a quick question in terms of

40
00:01:53,472 --> 00:01:58,156
how many people here have released an indie game?

41
00:01:58,156 --> 00:02:04,300
Great. And how many of you have marketed on your own?

42
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,523
And how many have worked with someone outside of your studio

43
00:02:10,523 --> 00:02:11,524
to market your game?

44
00:02:11,524 --> 00:02:12,085
OK, so it's a smaller number.

45
00:02:12,085 --> 00:02:14,386
So we're going to try and, you know,

46
00:02:14,386 --> 00:02:19,471
when we're putting this together, we have an hour,

47
00:02:19,471 --> 00:02:21,152
and there's only so much you can cover.

48
00:02:21,152 --> 00:02:23,414
And so we're trying to get the right level of content

49
00:02:23,414 --> 00:02:24,975
that will hopefully help with.

50
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,981
where you start and some of the fundamentals.

51
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,043
So I think some of this might be information

52
00:02:31,043 --> 00:02:33,784
that has a level of awareness already with you,

53
00:02:33,784 --> 00:02:35,986
but I think it's also important to think about things

54
00:02:35,986 --> 00:02:38,247
in a very fundamental way.

55
00:02:38,247 --> 00:02:39,207
You might have marketed a game,

56
00:02:39,207 --> 00:02:40,528
but you might not have approached it this way.

57
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:43,850
So while it feels like maybe I've already done that,

58
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,412
what I'd like to try and do is encourage you

59
00:02:46,412 --> 00:02:48,113
to step back a little and think about

60
00:02:48,113 --> 00:02:49,614
your planning process a little bit different

61
00:02:49,614 --> 00:02:51,915
and see if that might affect how you shape

62
00:02:51,915 --> 00:02:53,376
your marketing plan as it comes together.

63
00:02:55,703 --> 00:02:59,366
So I'm going to talk about where, when, and how to start.

64
00:02:59,366 --> 00:03:01,287
Some things to think about as you're

65
00:03:01,287 --> 00:03:02,248
developing your marketing plan.

66
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:05,330
I'll talk about different kinds of programs and vehicles

67
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,771
you can use while you're marketing a game.

68
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,913
We're going to use some specific examples,

69
00:03:09,913 --> 00:03:11,934
both from a launch that I recently worked on,

70
00:03:11,934 --> 00:03:14,015
as well as a launch that Justin did,

71
00:03:14,015 --> 00:03:15,797
and also fold in some other examples too.

72
00:03:17,546 --> 00:03:21,088
And importantly, don't be this guy.

73
00:03:21,088 --> 00:03:26,532
I still have people come to me and say,

74
00:03:26,532 --> 00:03:28,633
oh, I just released my game yesterday.

75
00:03:28,633 --> 00:03:30,054
Can you help me market this game?

76
00:03:30,054 --> 00:03:32,035
Or my game's coming out tomorrow.

77
00:03:32,035 --> 00:03:33,176
Can you help me market this game?

78
00:03:33,176 --> 00:03:35,178
Or it's coming out in a couple days.

79
00:03:35,178 --> 00:03:38,039
And I think the main point is, think about it

80
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,400
as early as you possibly can.

81
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,522
And you might not actually be actively marketing your game

82
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:43,503
from the very beginning.

83
00:03:44,363 --> 00:03:52,585
It surprises me that I still get a good number of people who don't integrate this into their plans at an early stage and then the game is coming out.

84
00:03:52,585 --> 00:04:01,547
And it's much, you have a much easier task starting, you know, six months out, nine months out and further in terms of how you're going to approach your marketing.

85
00:04:01,547 --> 00:04:04,308
You might not actually do active programs at that point.

86
00:04:04,308 --> 00:04:07,569
Also important, there's not really a magic bullet.

87
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:10,582
you see games out there and you say,

88
00:04:10,582 --> 00:04:12,183
man, that game is amazing, and look what it did,

89
00:04:12,183 --> 00:04:15,846
and it's so awesome, and they just did this one thing.

90
00:04:15,846 --> 00:04:19,469
But that's really, that's kind of a rarity.

91
00:04:19,469 --> 00:04:21,230
There are people who do get that magic bullet,

92
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,851
and they do have a program that just hits,

93
00:04:22,851 --> 00:04:24,092
or they have a game that just hits.

94
00:04:24,092 --> 00:04:27,975
But I think way more often, it takes a lot of persistence.

95
00:04:27,975 --> 00:04:28,756
It takes a lot of

96
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:34,603
you know, some trial and error, and not every program's going to be right for every single game.

97
00:04:34,603 --> 00:04:37,608
So you've sort of got to work your way around that and see what's going to,

98
00:04:37,608 --> 00:04:39,470
you know, understand your game and who it's going to appeal to

99
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:44,158
and what's going to be the best fit for a marketing program for your game.

100
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:44,839
In terms of...

101
00:04:45,775 --> 00:04:49,596
starting. I mean, I think there's some fundamental concepts that will really help you as you

102
00:04:49,596 --> 00:04:56,138
work your way through the marketing plan development process. And I tried to avoid, you know, some

103
00:04:56,138 --> 00:05:00,679
of the jargon, but I'm going to lapse into that briefly because it's useful. You know,

104
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:03,880
I mean, some of the jargon is useful because it's been around for a while. And, you know,

105
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,521
traditional marketers will talk about the four Ps. And when you're starting your marketing

106
00:05:07,521 --> 00:05:09,602
plan, you think about, um...

107
00:05:10,512 --> 00:05:11,532
What is my product?

108
00:05:11,532 --> 00:05:12,533
Let me define it.

109
00:05:12,533 --> 00:05:14,354
What are the features?

110
00:05:14,354 --> 00:05:15,414
What's going to be compelling about it?

111
00:05:15,414 --> 00:05:18,716
Where am I going to distribute my product?

112
00:05:18,716 --> 00:05:22,218
I think the way that you would market a casual game on mobile

113
00:05:22,218 --> 00:05:26,840
is going to be very different than you would market a deep.

114
00:05:27,203 --> 00:05:34,068
game to a core audience, a more experienced audience, on something like Steam or Humble.

115
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:39,253
It's a really important thing about the price. I think that's another thing that becomes

116
00:05:39,253 --> 00:05:44,777
an afterthought for people sometimes. The day before launch, they say, I'm just going

117
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:49,501
to sell it for a dollar, or $5, or $20. So there's some ways that you can be really intelligent

118
00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:56,166
about how you approach your pricing and survey the field and see who's performing well.

119
00:05:56,985 --> 00:05:58,867
price points that work better and worse than others,

120
00:05:58,867 --> 00:06:00,808
and not just say, oh, everyone's doing free-to-play,

121
00:06:00,808 --> 00:06:01,809
I'd better do free-to-play.

122
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:06,092
So I think it's really important to think about that P,

123
00:06:06,092 --> 00:06:07,894
of the four Ps, and then promotion.

124
00:06:07,894 --> 00:06:10,475
What are the vehicles and initiatives you're going to use

125
00:06:10,475 --> 00:06:11,837
to get visibility for your game?

126
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,081
Also, as part of the fundamentals early on,

127
00:06:16,081 --> 00:06:17,702
is who's my game for?

128
00:06:17,702 --> 00:06:20,844
The kind of audience is really going

129
00:06:20,844 --> 00:06:22,024
to affect the kind of program you do.

130
00:06:22,024 --> 00:06:24,325
If it's a casual game, if it's a core game,

131
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:26,546
if it's a quick pick up and play game,

132
00:06:26,546 --> 00:06:29,127
or if it's a game that has an established audience

133
00:06:29,127 --> 00:06:30,328
or a specialized genre.

134
00:06:32,878 --> 00:06:34,780
Your game pitch we'll talk a little bit more about

135
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,600
in a few minutes.

136
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,441
What's your elevator pitch?

137
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:37,562
How do you describe it to people

138
00:06:37,562 --> 00:06:40,183
in a succinct and compelling way?

139
00:06:40,183 --> 00:06:42,105
Think about environmental factors

140
00:06:42,105 --> 00:06:44,206
and the release landscape, seasonality,

141
00:06:44,206 --> 00:06:46,328
and then who's gonna drive marketing for your game,

142
00:06:46,328 --> 00:06:47,248
whether it's gonna be you,

143
00:06:47,248 --> 00:06:49,350
or it's gonna be someone in your studio,

144
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,151
or are you gonna think about hiring somebody?

145
00:06:51,151 --> 00:06:53,693
Also, as you're developing your plan,

146
00:06:53,693 --> 00:06:56,675
another helpful building block is thinking about

147
00:06:56,675 --> 00:07:00,117
what shape do I want my initiatives to take?

148
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:04,607
A great model is, I definitely encourage you guys

149
00:07:04,607 --> 00:07:06,247
to take pictures, there's no problem with that at all,

150
00:07:06,247 --> 00:07:08,828
but I also want you to know that this is all gonna be

151
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:12,329
posted on the GDC Vault shortly after the show.

152
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:16,470
So yeah, it's gonna be online somewhere,

153
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,110
but definitely take as many pictures as you want.

154
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,231
And I forgot to mention too that if anyone hasn't

155
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:22,611
turned off the ringers on their cell phone,

156
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:24,152
please do that so that phones don't ring

157
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,252
in the middle of the presentation.

158
00:07:27,241 --> 00:07:33,873
So yeah, so getting back to this point, I mean, I think you want to have your activities peak right as your game is launching.

159
00:07:33,873 --> 00:07:36,056
So be smart and strategic about...

160
00:07:36,658 --> 00:07:39,880
you know, what are your best kind of assets?

161
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,621
You know, what are the best things that you can have

162
00:07:42,621 --> 00:07:43,482
to generate interest?

163
00:07:43,482 --> 00:07:45,042
You know, trailers tend to be really good,

164
00:07:45,042 --> 00:07:47,964
or you might have an announcement about, you know,

165
00:07:47,964 --> 00:07:49,824
some really cool content that's in there,

166
00:07:49,824 --> 00:07:52,165
or you might sort of stagger out features

167
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:54,066
so that you're kind of building to a critical mass,

168
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:55,767
or you might have some contributors.

169
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,008
So, you know, again, just sort of thinking about

170
00:07:58,008 --> 00:08:00,109
all the things that you're gonna talk about from...

171
00:08:01,256 --> 00:08:05,478
your announce time to launch and how are you going to stage those in such a way that you're

172
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:06,418
kind of fueling this ramp.

173
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:12,320
And also important to think about how long you can sustain those communications.

174
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,042
There might be a tendency of people to get so excited about their game that they just

175
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:20,523
want to announce it and the game's not actually coming out, you know, realistically it's maybe

176
00:08:20,523 --> 00:08:23,444
not going to come out for two years or three years or four years and you sort of...

177
00:08:24,266 --> 00:08:26,487
it's hard to keep that interest sustained

178
00:08:26,487 --> 00:08:27,628
over a long period of time.

179
00:08:27,628 --> 00:08:31,229
So sometimes it's important to restrain yourself a little bit

180
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:34,231
and say, I'm going to announce it when I really

181
00:08:34,231 --> 00:08:36,572
feel like I've got all my ducks in a row,

182
00:08:36,572 --> 00:08:39,313
and I can build this launch and have a sustainable communication

183
00:08:39,313 --> 00:08:42,575
plan leading up to my release date.

184
00:08:42,575 --> 00:08:44,976
And just a quick last point here is just

185
00:08:44,976 --> 00:08:47,998
kind of thinking about that last two to four weeks

186
00:08:47,998 --> 00:08:50,319
as kind of the critical mass as you're building interest.

187
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:53,668
When you create the plan, I think

188
00:08:53,668 --> 00:08:55,310
it can be helpful to think about it the same way you

189
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,731
think about your game development.

190
00:08:56,731 --> 00:08:59,473
I imagine a lot of people in this room are game developers.

191
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:02,136
The indie studios tend to be the programmers and game designers

192
00:09:02,136 --> 00:09:03,897
and artists and so on.

193
00:09:03,897 --> 00:09:06,660
So take that same rigorous and structured approach,

194
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,662
calendarize it all out, and say,

195
00:09:09,762 --> 00:09:12,623
These are the things I need to do to get my marketing plan in place

196
00:09:12,623 --> 00:09:15,344
to have an effective launch.

197
00:09:15,344 --> 00:09:17,505
I'm going to have the plan done at this time.

198
00:09:17,505 --> 00:09:19,065
I'm going to do my announcements at this time.

199
00:09:19,065 --> 00:09:21,846
I'm going to stage my releases at this time.

200
00:09:21,846 --> 00:09:24,907
And so on. Just kind of really be kind of smart and intelligent

201
00:09:24,907 --> 00:09:26,688
in the same way you are about your game development.

202
00:09:26,688 --> 00:09:30,129
And while you're doing that, too, think about the calendar.

203
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:32,490
Think about seasonality.

204
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,830
What is the right time to launch my game?

205
00:09:35,721 --> 00:09:37,984
November is really, really crowded,

206
00:09:37,984 --> 00:09:41,849
and there's lots of AAA games, so think about that.

207
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:43,351
Summer can be a little bit quiet,

208
00:09:43,351 --> 00:09:45,553
so there's kind of some pros and cons of that,

209
00:09:45,553 --> 00:09:47,576
but think about that, think about big holidays.

210
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:50,929
Launching on July 4th is maybe not great,

211
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:53,350
unless you've got a game about American independence.

212
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,851
Maybe that might be an OK time.

213
00:09:55,851 --> 00:09:58,152
But also, like the Steam Christmas sale.

214
00:09:58,152 --> 00:10:00,392
If you want to launch on Steam and the Christmas sale is going

215
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,313
on, they take over the whole website

216
00:10:02,313 --> 00:10:03,594
and it's all about discounted games.

217
00:10:03,594 --> 00:10:05,934
So think about all those things and just kind of

218
00:10:05,934 --> 00:10:08,875
be as complete as you can while you're plotting out your launch

219
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,616
and then kind of build back from that.

220
00:10:10,616 --> 00:10:11,956
Also think about other competitive games,

221
00:10:11,956 --> 00:10:14,557
similar games or games that you think

222
00:10:14,557 --> 00:10:16,578
might be vying for attention against your game.

223
00:10:19,857 --> 00:10:23,640
I'm going to briefly touch on the marketing mix here, and we're going to get into more

224
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,261
detail as we get into some examples.

225
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:29,764
But as you're approaching your plan, think about all the different kinds of things you

226
00:10:29,764 --> 00:10:30,425
could do.

227
00:10:30,425 --> 00:10:32,487
And this is sort of tuned for Indies.

228
00:10:32,487 --> 00:10:36,250
Some vehicles, I think, can lend themselves to Indies a little bit more than AAA.

229
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,171
So PR can work really well.

230
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:42,715
I always encourage people to develop their audience as early as they possibly can.

231
00:10:42,715 --> 00:10:44,256
And what I mean by that is...

232
00:10:44,396 --> 00:10:47,559
get an email sign up front and center on your website.

233
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:48,760
And if someone's interested, then you

234
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,242
could get their information and have a conduit

235
00:10:51,242 --> 00:10:53,264
to communicate with them.

236
00:10:53,264 --> 00:10:55,306
And nowadays, Twitter works really well.

237
00:10:55,306 --> 00:10:56,407
Facebook works really well.

238
00:10:56,407 --> 00:10:58,609
So build your followers, and then you've

239
00:10:58,609 --> 00:11:00,731
got a direct channel of communication

240
00:11:00,731 --> 00:11:01,912
to all these people.

241
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:04,194
While PR can be great, you've got gatekeepers at PR.

242
00:11:04,194 --> 00:11:06,896
And it's all up to the editors about whether you

243
00:11:06,896 --> 00:11:07,697
get covered or not.

244
00:11:07,697 --> 00:11:10,239
But when you start having your audience of hundreds, thousands,

245
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:11,360
and more of followers.

246
00:11:12,409 --> 00:11:15,051
you can sort of have another supplemental form

247
00:11:15,051 --> 00:11:17,754
of communication if PR is not firing for you.

248
00:11:17,754 --> 00:11:21,098
We'll talk a little bit about events and promotions.

249
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:22,639
You know, these are kind of all the different things

250
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,761
that you could do in your marketing mix.

251
00:11:24,761 --> 00:11:27,344
And you, not all these initiatives are right for every game

252
00:11:27,344 --> 00:11:28,746
so you should think about this

253
00:11:28,746 --> 00:11:30,828
and what's gonna be most appropriate for your game.

254
00:11:32,298 --> 00:11:35,440
And also think about how the landscape is changing

255
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,902
and how new vehicles are emerging.

256
00:11:37,902 --> 00:11:40,443
And a lot of these things are very great for indies

257
00:11:40,443 --> 00:11:43,105
and not so appropriate for AAA games.

258
00:11:43,105 --> 00:11:46,528
So Game Jams, editors pay attention to Game Jams

259
00:11:46,528 --> 00:11:50,630
and they look for those content coming from there.

260
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:53,372
YouTube and Twitch, I think the visibility of those

261
00:11:53,372 --> 00:11:55,474
is getting really well established with indies now.

262
00:11:55,474 --> 00:11:57,295
I think three, six months ago.

263
00:11:58,055 --> 00:12:14,994
people weren't thinking about the video channels as much as they are now, but I'll just kind of re-emphasize again that that is a super important and impactful channel that also can supplement traditional PR and can work just as well as traditional PR in a lot of cases.

264
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,371
Again, I'm not going to go through every bullet here

265
00:12:17,371 --> 00:12:18,832
because we've got limited time, but I

266
00:12:18,832 --> 00:12:19,853
wanted to get these in front of you

267
00:12:19,853 --> 00:12:24,295
and also say, pay attention to other things that are emerging.

268
00:12:24,295 --> 00:12:26,476
I find Twitter to be one of the most useful news sources.

269
00:12:26,476 --> 00:12:28,537
And so follow a lot of indies and see what they're doing

270
00:12:28,537 --> 00:12:30,879
and see what's working for them and what's resonating.

271
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:33,800
And when someone announces something,

272
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,241
that can spark some ideas for you.

273
00:12:35,241 --> 00:12:37,102
So I think that's been one of the most useful vehicles

274
00:12:37,102 --> 00:12:39,263
I've found, not only for communication,

275
00:12:39,263 --> 00:12:42,425
but also for getting intelligence in the space.

276
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:48,644
So now I'm going to segue into an example of a campaign that I worked on and sort of

277
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:51,405
walk through some of the points that I was just relaying.

278
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:58,128
So Mini Motor Racing was released by a game, by a company called The Binary Mill, they're

279
00:12:58,128 --> 00:13:00,389
based in Australia.

280
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:03,791
They had done a variety of games in different genres, all the way from...

281
00:13:06,761 --> 00:13:10,344
you know, kind of a comedy game to, you know, an action game.

282
00:13:10,344 --> 00:13:15,068
And so this was a brand new genre, a new franchise that they were looking to establish,

283
00:13:15,068 --> 00:13:17,230
but they didn't have visibility in racing games,

284
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,432
or this mini motor franchise was kind of an unknown entity.

285
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:23,996
They were planning for a December launch, which as I talked about seasonality,

286
00:13:23,996 --> 00:13:26,599
I think there can be pros of cons of that, but that was their plan.

287
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:29,381
And so I think we thought about how are we going to work with that

288
00:13:29,381 --> 00:13:31,743
and see if that could work towards our advantage.

289
00:13:32,806 --> 00:13:37,538
And so that's kind of the broad strokes of Minimotor Racing.

290
00:13:37,538 --> 00:13:40,225
It launched first on iOS, was the lead platform.

291
00:13:42,218 --> 00:13:45,599
So we thought about what are the fundamental components

292
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,460
of mini motor racing.

293
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,101
It's an arcade style casual game.

294
00:13:50,101 --> 00:13:52,261
It's RC radio control games, and it's

295
00:13:52,261 --> 00:13:53,141
got some breadth and depth.

296
00:13:53,141 --> 00:13:55,722
It's a small studio.

297
00:13:55,722 --> 00:13:58,163
At peak, it was about 17 people.

298
00:13:58,163 --> 00:14:01,324
But as we looked at the game, I think indie,

299
00:14:01,324 --> 00:14:03,364
there could be a long discussion about what's

300
00:14:03,364 --> 00:14:05,425
indie and what's not indie.

301
00:14:05,425 --> 00:14:06,365
But I think a lot of times, you'll

302
00:14:06,365 --> 00:14:09,026
kind of see these alternative, crafty, artistic games.

303
00:14:09,026 --> 00:14:10,166
And that can really.

304
00:14:11,088 --> 00:14:14,110
work well for the indie terminology in the press.

305
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,570
So while we talked about indie to some degree,

306
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,071
that wasn't our main messaging point.

307
00:14:18,071 --> 00:14:20,712
And we landed at a quick messaging line,

308
00:14:20,712 --> 00:14:22,192
which was Little Cards, Big Fun.

309
00:14:22,192 --> 00:14:23,153
Developing the marketing plan, we

310
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,453
thought about some of the considerations

311
00:14:25,453 --> 00:14:29,455
I mentioned before, the nature of the game,

312
00:14:29,455 --> 00:14:30,535
seasonality, the genre.

313
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:36,105
what we thought was going to work best for it, whether it was going to be, you know,

314
00:14:36,105 --> 00:14:39,306
we had some good partner opportunities, which I'll talk about in a second.

315
00:14:39,306 --> 00:14:41,526
We looked at the channel.

316
00:14:41,526 --> 00:14:44,447
We put together some timed promotions, which I'll talk about.

317
00:14:44,447 --> 00:14:47,148
And then the team was also very nimble, so they were able to take advantage

318
00:14:47,148 --> 00:14:48,788
of different opportunities as they emerge.

319
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:55,842
So one of the first things we decided to do was, you know, at the December launch, we

320
00:14:55,842 --> 00:14:57,403
came up with some seasonal content.

321
00:14:57,403 --> 00:14:58,204
When I say we, it was them.

322
00:14:58,204 --> 00:14:59,785
It was the game developers.

323
00:14:59,785 --> 00:15:04,268
So there was a, but we had that conversation and said, you know, is there something we

324
00:15:04,268 --> 00:15:05,228
could do to fit there?

325
00:15:05,228 --> 00:15:11,312
And they came up with a great holiday themed track and, you know, Santa's sleigh was one

326
00:15:11,312 --> 00:15:11,992
of the vehicles.

327
00:15:11,992 --> 00:15:16,475
And, you know, this thing had so much legs that one year later we did it again.

328
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,612
They actually, they used the gyroscope on the phone,

329
00:15:19,612 --> 00:15:21,413
so it was like a snow globe on the main interface.

330
00:15:21,413 --> 00:15:22,694
So they did some fun things with that

331
00:15:22,694 --> 00:15:25,836
to really help that connect with the seasonality.

332
00:15:25,836 --> 00:15:28,698
They also knew the half-brick folks well,

333
00:15:28,698 --> 00:15:31,500
so they, and Fruit Ninja was kind of at its peak

334
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,781
at the time, it still is really well,

335
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:36,084
but they were able to get some Fruit Ninja content

336
00:15:36,084 --> 00:15:39,226
in there with a track and a car

337
00:15:39,226 --> 00:15:41,688
that was loaned out from the folks there.

338
00:15:42,726 --> 00:15:45,588
So that was helpful.

339
00:15:45,588 --> 00:15:47,050
PR, I think a lot of times you'll pitch things

340
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,051
and see how it resonates with people.

341
00:15:49,051 --> 00:15:53,715
And we were fortunate that IGN responded well to the game,

342
00:15:53,715 --> 00:15:55,397
and they put it on their home page.

343
00:15:55,397 --> 00:15:57,659
But again, we needed a balanced marketing plan.

344
00:15:57,659 --> 00:15:58,920
So if PR hits, that's great.

345
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,183
But if it doesn't, we needed other things in our arsenal

346
00:16:02,183 --> 00:16:03,344
if that wasn't going to hit.

347
00:16:03,344 --> 00:16:04,725
But we had the good fortune of getting

348
00:16:04,725 --> 00:16:07,887
on the home page of IGN by pitching them.

349
00:16:07,887 --> 00:16:09,849
Reviewed well, which helps tremendously.

350
00:16:11,229 --> 00:16:15,312
I think game quality is always kind of spoken about repeatedly

351
00:16:15,312 --> 00:16:16,733
is a really important thing, but I'll just

352
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:18,394
kind of re-emphasize that here.

353
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:22,557
And then we worked with the folks on the App Store,

354
00:16:22,557 --> 00:16:26,200
and we got a great slot at launch day, which, again, when

355
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,662
it works, it's fantastic, but it doesn't always work,

356
00:16:28,662 --> 00:16:31,284
so you've got to have other things in your arsenal.

357
00:16:31,284 --> 00:16:33,925
And then that carried over into best of 2012

358
00:16:33,925 --> 00:16:36,107
on the App Store, and it was a choice on Google Play.

359
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:43,744
We also came up with a plan that had different components over time.

360
00:16:43,744 --> 00:16:50,709
So we launched in December, so we had a really nice peak.

361
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:54,352
We went full price at $2.99 on tablet and $1.99 on phone.

362
00:16:54,352 --> 00:17:00,396
And then we had kind of a staged promotion where we were going to go discounted about

363
00:17:00,396 --> 00:17:01,777
two to three months in.

364
00:17:01,777 --> 00:17:04,580
So you could see we had a nice peak as we got into February.

365
00:17:05,782 --> 00:17:08,543
And then that peak you see in May,

366
00:17:08,543 --> 00:17:09,843
we were back at full price.

367
00:17:09,843 --> 00:17:11,684
And the team was thinking about an update.

368
00:17:11,684 --> 00:17:14,905
And what we did was we collected some features

369
00:17:14,905 --> 00:17:18,847
and we turned it into not just 1.1, but we turned it in 1.5.

370
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,728
And we made it a bigger release.

371
00:17:20,728 --> 00:17:21,708
And we got more attention.

372
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,630
And we got another feature on the App Store.

373
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,351
And I think part of the point here

374
00:17:27,351 --> 00:17:29,352
is not thinking just about the launch,

375
00:17:29,352 --> 00:17:31,192
but thinking about what's your sustaining plan.

376
00:17:31,192 --> 00:17:33,413
And don't have everything just about day one,

377
00:17:33,413 --> 00:17:33,853
because.

378
00:17:34,773 --> 00:17:38,235
again, when it works, it's great, but you've spent, you know, one, two, three years on

379
00:17:38,235 --> 00:17:43,298
your game, and, you know, if you don't make it all in the first week, think about monetizing

380
00:17:43,298 --> 00:17:44,718
it over a longer period of time.

381
00:17:44,718 --> 00:17:47,700
So I think that's a really important part of the planning process as well.

382
00:17:50,321 --> 00:17:52,923
We subsequently launched on Android,

383
00:17:52,923 --> 00:17:56,044
which simultaneous releases can be great.

384
00:17:56,044 --> 00:17:57,865
And I recommend that as often as possible,

385
00:17:57,865 --> 00:18:00,367
but I know it's not always possible.

386
00:18:00,367 --> 00:18:02,228
So fortunately, it worked out well for this game.

387
00:18:02,228 --> 00:18:06,270
We got another wave of interest, and activity, and reviews,

388
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:10,833
and app store placements.

389
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,114
And when I talk about opportunism,

390
00:18:12,114 --> 00:18:16,096
interest grew to such a degree that someone came to them

391
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:18,737
and wanted to do arcade cabinets and different arcades

392
00:18:18,737 --> 00:18:19,198
around there.

393
00:18:19,786 --> 00:18:20,586
around the world.

394
00:18:20,586 --> 00:18:22,648
So that's a little visual you see off to the side.

395
00:18:22,648 --> 00:18:25,510
Ultimately, the game's gone on to do

396
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,071
6 million downloads, which is great.

397
00:18:27,071 --> 00:18:28,812
There was a free app of the day promotion,

398
00:18:28,812 --> 00:18:29,992
which worked out really well.

399
00:18:29,992 --> 00:18:33,395
And they had in-app purchasing to help monetize that.

400
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:35,156
So I think the summary point here

401
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:37,217
is think about your plan holistically

402
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:40,259
and think about all the different things

403
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:41,820
that you could layer into it and come up

404
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,981
with a plan over time that could be strategic.

405
00:18:43,981 --> 00:18:46,223
With that, I will turn things over to Justin.

406
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,460
Hey, what's happening?

407
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,282
I'm going to tell everything, or tell the main points

408
00:18:51,282 --> 00:18:55,804
through my perspective, which is an indie.

409
00:18:55,804 --> 00:18:58,225
I believe that marketing and sales

410
00:18:58,225 --> 00:19:00,306
emanates from the inside out.

411
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,127
So when you're marketing, you're not only

412
00:19:02,127 --> 00:19:05,308
marketing to the consumer.

413
00:19:05,308 --> 00:19:07,089
You're also marketing towards your team.

414
00:19:07,089 --> 00:19:11,431
You're marketing towards your publisher,

415
00:19:11,431 --> 00:19:13,652
anyone you're going to work with.

416
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:13,752
So.

417
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,642
These are my main points for the whole talk.

418
00:19:16,642 --> 00:19:19,005
Socialize and relate to people.

419
00:19:19,005 --> 00:19:21,267
Add value to people's lives.

420
00:19:21,267 --> 00:19:22,609
Cultivate mentors.

421
00:19:22,609 --> 00:19:24,290
Be persistent, resilient, and tenacious.

422
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,312
Pursue visibility.

423
00:19:26,312 --> 00:19:30,116
And what works for them works for them.

424
00:19:30,116 --> 00:19:34,201
So I say that because when we spoke last time,

425
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:35,582
people had questions about.

426
00:19:37,133 --> 00:19:44,601
you know, specific points and it didn't quite relate to what we did. It only relates to

427
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:49,585
you. So this is, the game that we released is called Super Combo Man. This is our elevator

428
00:19:49,585 --> 00:19:55,230
pitch and it is 2D side-scrolling fighters set in a sticker world with custom combos

429
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:59,995
and hand-drawn animations. And it took us a while to get to the point where that our

430
00:19:59,995 --> 00:20:00,876
vision was complete.

431
00:20:02,575 --> 00:20:05,337
I'm going to explain everything through chapters of my journey.

432
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:08,440
And the journey was the plan, the journey, the hustle,

433
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:08,960
and the launch.

434
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,222
And it took us four years to complete this game,

435
00:20:12,222 --> 00:20:15,765
and many struggles, a lot of pitches.

436
00:20:15,765 --> 00:20:19,167
And this is how we rolled and did things.

437
00:20:20,168 --> 00:20:25,592
So as Joel mentioned, we, so my background

438
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:27,914
was a graphic designer, I had a graphic design business.

439
00:20:27,914 --> 00:20:33,438
I graduated from the Art Institute as a game artist,

440
00:20:33,438 --> 00:20:36,120
environment game artist, and I went and worked for THQ

441
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,221
for a few months and I hated it.

442
00:20:38,221 --> 00:20:42,324
So then I turned to develop, someone laughing.

443
00:20:43,073 --> 00:20:51,278
But, yeah, so I started a graphic design business, and I cultivated some mentors that helped

444
00:20:51,278 --> 00:20:57,721
me through the strategies of business operation. And we released the first game, which was

445
00:20:57,721 --> 00:21:04,864
on iOS, and we said as a team, let's create something that's bigger, has more production

446
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:06,585
value, and that we can release on a console.

447
00:21:07,005 --> 00:21:10,690
So we created a marketing plan, we created a business plan,

448
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:13,854
and the marketing plan kind of rolled into the business plan.

449
00:21:13,854 --> 00:21:17,298
And we wanted to spend most of our time on the game production,

450
00:21:17,298 --> 00:21:22,604
because, you know, we're artists first, and then, you know, business people second.

451
00:21:22,604 --> 00:21:24,887
So one of the things that we wanted to do early on

452
00:21:25,528 --> 00:21:28,510
was figure out how we can market with someone else.

453
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:32,133
And we figured early on that we would work with a publisher.

454
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:33,714
We weren't sure how we were going to do that,

455
00:21:33,714 --> 00:21:35,875
but the numbers kind of spoke for themselves.

456
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:39,418
So when we talked to mentors and we created a business plan,

457
00:21:39,418 --> 00:21:41,600
we understood that it would cost a lot for us

458
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,462
to just pay someone to outright market for us.

459
00:21:44,462 --> 00:21:48,485
So we decided that may be the next, the best step.

460
00:21:50,106 --> 00:21:55,327
We did a lot of market research, figured out the visibility mechanisms for each platform,

461
00:21:55,327 --> 00:22:01,089
and that's basically how we talked to, I talked to a lot of mentors.

462
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:06,830
I had a mentor, Clinton Keith, who brought agile development to the games industry,

463
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,171
and he helped me with the business plan as well,

464
00:22:09,171 --> 00:22:13,472
and it showed us, you know, concrete details on how we were going to press forward with this game.

465
00:22:15,151 --> 00:22:18,493
So in the early stages, we had our business plan.

466
00:22:18,493 --> 00:22:21,435
There was a contest for Nexon where

467
00:22:21,435 --> 00:22:24,878
they wanted to create the next Maple story.

468
00:22:24,878 --> 00:22:28,941
And they had like a $100,000 pot for the winner.

469
00:22:28,941 --> 00:22:31,222
And we felt that our art style was perfect.

470
00:22:31,222 --> 00:22:32,623
That's our little character.

471
00:22:32,623 --> 00:22:35,325
Struggles with the talking fanny pack

472
00:22:35,325 --> 00:22:37,166
and the mullet nuggets on top.

473
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:39,908
We were going for this anime, wacky feel.

474
00:22:39,908 --> 00:22:43,531
And we had this whole idea that

475
00:22:43,711 --> 00:22:46,014
the characters were all going to be stickers.

476
00:22:46,014 --> 00:22:49,339
And so when we pitched it to Nexon, we were like, OK,

477
00:22:49,339 --> 00:22:53,644
so they have these Nexon cards at Walmart and at Target,

478
00:22:53,644 --> 00:22:56,128
which they have different keys on them

479
00:22:56,128 --> 00:22:59,512
to get different abilities or just money for their store.

480
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:04,955
And so the way we pitched it was we had little animations and different characters and we

481
00:23:04,955 --> 00:23:10,361
had our business plan and the idea was you peel the stickers back and you get a key for

482
00:23:10,361 --> 00:23:13,825
different abilities and items that you can use.

483
00:23:14,939 --> 00:23:20,685
We didn't, it didn't work out well, we didn't win the contest, but we did get some good

484
00:23:20,685 --> 00:23:25,931
feedback from that and we knew where to move forward with our next steps.

485
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:30,295
And it was a very iterative process as far as our marketing plan was concerned and that

486
00:23:30,295 --> 00:23:31,737
really helped us because we understood

487
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:34,639
who they were trying to reach at that moment.

488
00:23:34,639 --> 00:23:38,141
The next thing we did was we did a Kickstarter campaign,

489
00:23:38,141 --> 00:23:40,503
and this was in the early days before, this was 2010,

490
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:43,905
so you could see how long this game stretched back.

491
00:23:43,905 --> 00:23:47,848
We released the game in July 2014.

492
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:53,773
But we did a video and the video was super ridiculous. It didn't have a lot of game play. We

493
00:23:53,773 --> 00:23:58,917
showed a lot of the team. We were marketing our team to people and I think like our moms and

494
00:23:58,917 --> 00:24:03,621
uncles were the only ones who actually, you know, put in. You could see the total amount was

495
00:24:03,621 --> 00:24:09,125
a thousand bucks. So it really didn't get us far but it did give us a, you know, a good video

496
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:13,889
that we can, and the video was really ridiculous. I went to Walmart and had, you know, those

497
00:24:13,889 --> 00:24:17,933
little styrofoam earths and stuff, you know, the planets.

498
00:24:18,193 --> 00:24:21,575
And I wore those on my head to be this character.

499
00:24:21,575 --> 00:24:23,436
So it was very entertaining, and we just

500
00:24:23,436 --> 00:24:26,318
kept iterating on our process for marketing.

501
00:24:26,318 --> 00:24:27,578
And that's what I was talking about,

502
00:24:27,578 --> 00:24:30,240
is we were marketing not only for the people who

503
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,821
were going to buy the game, but to the publishers

504
00:24:32,821 --> 00:24:34,462
that we were talking to.

505
00:24:34,462 --> 00:24:37,004
Right here, you see the product positioning chart,

506
00:24:37,004 --> 00:24:38,805
which my mentor showed me how to do.

507
00:24:38,805 --> 00:24:43,187
It was a good exercise to show where our target market was.

508
00:24:43,187 --> 00:24:45,428
You see at the very end, it's.

509
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:49,311
A more of a hardcore game on the other side,

510
00:24:49,311 --> 00:24:51,873
it's more of a casual, ours fit in between.

511
00:24:51,873 --> 00:24:54,155
It was like a combination of Marvel vs. Capcom,

512
00:24:54,155 --> 00:24:57,138
Street Fighter meets Streets of Rage.

513
00:24:57,138 --> 00:24:58,339
Those are some of the stickers,

514
00:24:58,339 --> 00:25:01,501
and we have our product plan right here,

515
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:02,482
our development plan.

516
00:25:02,482 --> 00:25:06,185
So different key points in time were like GDC,

517
00:25:06,185 --> 00:25:08,147
where we thought we were gonna show PAX.

518
00:25:08,147 --> 00:25:09,408
We thought we would show,

519
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:12,090
those were some of our milestones.

520
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:14,512
And how we also created the elevator statement

521
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:15,513
is there to the left too.

522
00:25:16,658 --> 00:25:20,943
So as a graphic designer, I knew the importance of presentation

523
00:25:20,943 --> 00:25:24,186
and how presentation plays into who you're marketing towards

524
00:25:24,186 --> 00:25:26,428
and who you're contacting.

525
00:25:26,428 --> 00:25:27,790
So we were talking to PlayStation.

526
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:31,233
So I created this two-sheet with the Sony Vita

527
00:25:31,233 --> 00:25:34,416
and how it would work when you're swiping

528
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:36,618
and the stickers would peel back.

529
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:37,980
And it really resonated with them.

530
00:25:38,861 --> 00:25:43,326
at the time, I don't even know why they did this, but Gamefly had an Android program and we were

531
00:25:43,326 --> 00:25:49,012
trying to find any opportunities possible to, you know, get the money and the marketing to move

532
00:25:49,012 --> 00:25:55,619
forward with our game. So that kind of talks about the, you know, the pre-production and the

533
00:25:55,619 --> 00:25:57,041
plans that we came up with.

534
00:25:58,238 --> 00:26:01,882
it obviously doesn't turn out the way you want to exactly.

535
00:26:01,882 --> 00:26:06,406
So I'm going to tell you a little bit about my team story.

536
00:26:06,406 --> 00:26:11,890
So after I was in my master's program for production

537
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:14,633
and design and management.

538
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:22,822
And the opportunity came up to help my mentor with a leadership forum at the IGDA.

539
00:26:22,822 --> 00:26:31,483
And during that time, we also, there was also a contest to be at IGN Game Spy and have office

540
00:26:31,483 --> 00:26:31,923
space.

541
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,264
They had an incubator.

542
00:26:33,264 --> 00:26:39,725
And when that happened, we pitched to them and we used everything that we gathered beforehand

543
00:26:39,725 --> 00:26:43,526
and they saw our video, they saw our marketing plan and really dug it.

544
00:26:43,526 --> 00:26:45,446
So they gave us an opportunity.

545
00:26:46,718 --> 00:26:49,079
They gave us the go ahead, they loved our pitch,

546
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,720
and they were like, come up here.

547
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,901
So we had to figure out within a week's time

548
00:26:53,901 --> 00:26:55,702
whether we were going to take that opportunity.

549
00:26:55,702 --> 00:26:59,623
And one of my mentors was, he's like,

550
00:26:59,623 --> 00:27:01,504
you got to take life by the balls

551
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,925
and just go with it because it's a once in a lifetime

552
00:27:03,925 --> 00:27:04,385
opportunity.

553
00:27:04,385 --> 00:27:05,385
So I took the opportunity.

554
00:27:05,385 --> 00:27:08,807
I'm a very opportunistic person, and every time I see something,

555
00:27:08,807 --> 00:27:09,907
I'll go for it.

556
00:27:09,907 --> 00:27:11,548
And it ended up turning out well.

557
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:14,009
We were in IGN, and we worked for three months

558
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:15,610
straight on the prototype.

559
00:27:17,238 --> 00:27:19,680
Um, so this, this goes to the training.

560
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:26,287
So we had GDC after the three months of, of hard development, we, uh, had a GDC demo

561
00:27:26,287 --> 00:27:26,867
space.

562
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:34,216
and that was a great opportunity to talk to press and 47 communications which is actually

563
00:27:34,216 --> 00:27:40,220
here in San Francisco, they had their lead Kramer who used to work with Capcom and they

564
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:43,782
trained us. They actually came in and told us how to talk to people because I had a,

565
00:27:43,782 --> 00:27:50,266
I was very nervous to talk to press about our game or just to talk to people in general

566
00:27:50,266 --> 00:27:54,489
and I didn't know exactly what to say. I would fumble my words or I would give these lengthy

567
00:27:54,989 --> 00:27:59,525
explanations of things and they helped me become succinct and concise.

568
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:07,512
They also had press pitch sessions at IGN where they had like seven people from members

569
00:28:07,512 --> 00:28:11,714
of the press come in and just rapidly fire off different questions, take pictures of

570
00:28:11,714 --> 00:28:15,876
us and talk to us in a press junket type of fashion.

571
00:28:15,876 --> 00:28:21,038
I remember at one point I completely froze up in front of everyone and I didn't know

572
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:24,220
if I was going to jump back from that, but it wasn't as bad as I thought.

573
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:27,101
So it was really interesting to do that training.

574
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:33,125
just to understand how you market towards other people because marketing towards other people,

575
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:39,490
each member of the press, each publisher that you talk to, each person that you're selling to

576
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:44,994
has a different story, a different background, and you want to make sure that you create that story

577
00:28:44,994 --> 00:28:48,857
that, you know, works with them, you know, and reflects their ideals.

578
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:54,450
So these images represent our time there,

579
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,411
my mentor in the middle, Clinton Keith,

580
00:28:56,411 --> 00:28:58,833
and we were at the Indy Open House.

581
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:02,195
We won the next Game Boss, which was this reality show on IGN.

582
00:29:02,195 --> 00:29:03,936
We worked very hard.

583
00:29:03,936 --> 00:29:09,539
You see the cast of the Indy Open House,

584
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,320
and just different people playing the game.

585
00:29:13,283 --> 00:29:15,784
So I'll say this is the hustle phase one,

586
00:29:15,784 --> 00:29:18,626
even though this is like the hustle phase eight.

587
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:20,066
We showed at multiple events

588
00:29:20,066 --> 00:29:23,268
and try to figure out how we can show free.

589
00:29:23,268 --> 00:29:24,549
And that's really important too,

590
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:29,571
is when you're pitching, you show your plan

591
00:29:29,571 --> 00:29:31,572
and you figure out how you align

592
00:29:31,572 --> 00:29:34,654
with specific products and product holders.

593
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:40,017
We, we at that time, you know, I lost my team so I jumped back and had to figure

594
00:29:40,017 --> 00:29:42,298
out how we were going to pitch and raise more money.

595
00:29:42,298 --> 00:29:47,722
And, um, there, you know, there was a lot of rejection and I had to figure

596
00:29:47,722 --> 00:29:49,223
out how to bounce back from that.

597
00:29:49,223 --> 00:29:53,285
We jumped, uh, to a second Kickstarter fundraising campaign.

598
00:29:54,620 --> 00:30:00,202
At the end of the Indie Open House, we had a large presentation and it gathered the attention

599
00:30:00,202 --> 00:30:04,863
of Adam Boyes, who is now one of the VPs at Sony.

600
00:30:04,863 --> 00:30:08,263
And he just took me under his wing and he was like, I want you to pitch to every publisher

601
00:30:08,263 --> 00:30:12,724
possible because that was one of the only ways I felt that we were going to actually

602
00:30:12,724 --> 00:30:15,585
get the game out and market it towards a broad audience.

603
00:30:15,585 --> 00:30:17,325
So he took me to Capcom.

604
00:30:17,785 --> 00:30:20,608
He took me to Sega, he took me to EA,

605
00:30:20,608 --> 00:30:21,709
all these different places.

606
00:30:21,709 --> 00:30:23,090
Some people I just went to on my own,

607
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,892
I was just pitching, pitching, pitching.

608
00:30:24,892 --> 00:30:28,896
And also, my other mentor who was in business,

609
00:30:28,896 --> 00:30:31,598
she knew nothing about video games.

610
00:30:31,598 --> 00:30:33,700
So she was teaching it from a different standpoint,

611
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,221
which is very interesting.

612
00:30:35,221 --> 00:30:38,304
And it's good to get multiple angles and paradigms

613
00:30:38,304 --> 00:30:40,706
when you're trying to figure out.

614
00:30:41,087 --> 00:30:45,769
your road to success with marketing and developing your game. So at one point I was in

615
00:30:45,769 --> 00:30:50,351
Berkeley and I was like there's this place called Cream, I don't know if you guys know of

616
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:56,494
it, it's an ice cream sandwich stop, ice cream sandwich store and I was like yeah my

617
00:30:56,494 --> 00:31:02,496
character eats cookies and it would be a perfect mascot for your marketing campaigns and

618
00:31:02,496 --> 00:31:07,519
they totally got it. They dug it and they wanted to do it but the thing was we actually

619
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:07,899
wanted.

620
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:12,661
We needed money too, so marketing wasn't the only thing we were searching after.

621
00:31:12,661 --> 00:31:18,264
So it didn't completely fit, but us pitching how the marketing would work

622
00:31:18,264 --> 00:31:21,646
completely fit with their campaign. It was a good experience.

623
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:25,128
These are some of the other events that we showed at.

624
00:31:25,128 --> 00:31:30,150
Hot Import Nights, they had a Dead or Alive 5 booth there.

625
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:33,212
The Comic Con, Evo, our game's a fighting game,

626
00:31:33,212 --> 00:31:37,374
so we went to the biggest fighting game competition in Vegas in July.

627
00:31:39,113 --> 00:31:41,414
So this is Hustle phase 100.

628
00:31:41,414 --> 00:31:42,194
So we were going 100%.

629
00:31:42,194 --> 00:31:47,635
We just raised more investment, and we

630
00:31:47,635 --> 00:31:50,276
started a second Kickstarter fundraiser campaign.

631
00:31:50,276 --> 00:31:53,477
The second fundraiser campaign, I

632
00:31:53,477 --> 00:31:57,258
understood how the media and the press worked more,

633
00:31:57,258 --> 00:31:59,638
and I already had a lot of different contacts there.

634
00:31:59,638 --> 00:32:02,639
So all I did was reach back to them,

635
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:05,600
told them that we were making this game,

636
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,380
or we progressed in our game.

637
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:12,662
further, showed them new builds, and they were really interested in it. It got a lot of buzz

638
00:32:12,662 --> 00:32:19,765
that way. I also talked to the publishers as well. So I always reached back at different stages of

639
00:32:19,765 --> 00:32:26,228
development when we were trying to move forward with marketing, investment, whatever.

640
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,431
At this time, the mix was born.

641
00:32:29,431 --> 00:32:36,257
So as Joel spoke about, we created this media indie

642
00:32:36,257 --> 00:32:40,180
exchange at IGN where just the press and the indies

643
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,320
got together.

644
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,983
And they were able to vibe off of each other.

645
00:32:44,983 --> 00:32:47,025
The press got to see games they've never seen

646
00:32:47,025 --> 00:32:48,846
from the hottest indies.

647
00:32:48,846 --> 00:32:51,909
And the indies who, some of them don't really

648
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:54,310
speak out to press, even though they have great content

649
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,211
and great tech.

650
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:59,710
we're able to talk to them in a more closed manner, you know?

651
00:33:01,962 --> 00:33:06,205
So we did a second Kickstarter. It was, it ended up being successful.

652
00:33:06,205 --> 00:33:09,627
We, I reached back to publishers. Capcom really liked the game,

653
00:33:09,627 --> 00:33:12,429
but the deal wasn't really, didn't really fit with us.

654
00:33:12,429 --> 00:33:17,993
And at the second GDC we were at, I went and pitched to Adult Swim Games.

655
00:33:17,993 --> 00:33:21,996
They loved the idea, and they, they didn't take it right away,

656
00:33:21,996 --> 00:33:23,637
because they weren't working with Steam.

657
00:33:23,637 --> 00:33:27,000
But when they did start working with Steam, they were like,

658
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,500
OK, let's...

659
00:33:28,169 --> 00:33:32,513
let's do this. And it was good because we understood their marketing. They already had

660
00:33:32,513 --> 00:33:37,438
influencer marketing campaigns and people on Twitch and that's kind of where things

661
00:33:37,438 --> 00:33:42,703
were going. And it really helped us to push the game along and get other people interested

662
00:33:42,703 --> 00:33:47,528
because once they got interested, we were able to get more investor support, more press

663
00:33:47,528 --> 00:33:50,831
support and the people that I contacted before, I used that as leverage.

664
00:33:52,848 --> 00:33:57,392
So this is like, so we were supposed to launch,

665
00:33:57,392 --> 00:33:59,974
I believe, in April, and it took a little longer

666
00:33:59,974 --> 00:34:04,978
to release, because this was our first large game.

667
00:34:04,978 --> 00:34:08,100
And we launched on Steam and Humble.

668
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:11,403
There was initial PR fumble with the publisher

669
00:34:11,403 --> 00:34:13,785
and the production staff there.

670
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:17,748
Early build got sent out to all of the press, but.

671
00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:24,522
Marketing wise it was a complete success because we got hit by every single

672
00:34:24,522 --> 00:34:27,048
Not every single but most of major press

673
00:34:28,184 --> 00:34:31,447
checked our game out, gave our game previews or reviews.

674
00:34:31,447 --> 00:34:34,950
We had Northern Lion, some of the largest YouTubers

675
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:35,830
checked our game out.

676
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:37,492
And regardless if they liked it or not,

677
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:40,695
because they got a buggy build, it still got a lot of press.

678
00:34:40,695 --> 00:34:46,980
And the whole education of what we did in that four years

679
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,662
kind of escalated to that point, which was really good.

680
00:34:50,743 --> 00:34:52,904
We maximized coverage.

681
00:34:52,904 --> 00:34:55,726
We built a mix out of it.

682
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:58,448
We had our initial Humble Bundle with Adult Swim,

683
00:34:58,448 --> 00:35:01,029
and I cultivated a relationship with Humble Bundle.

684
00:35:01,029 --> 00:35:05,132
So what ended up happening was we got our rights back

685
00:35:05,132 --> 00:35:07,794
from Adult Swim because we wanted

686
00:35:07,794 --> 00:35:09,735
to start doing things on our own because they didn't want

687
00:35:09,735 --> 00:35:11,556
to support it anymore.

688
00:35:11,556 --> 00:35:13,638
And we released all of these updates,

689
00:35:13,638 --> 00:35:16,019
and we did another Humble Bundle,

690
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:17,300
which was a Brawler Humble Bundle,

691
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,221
which was pretty successful.

692
00:35:19,862 --> 00:35:23,648
And it also built our foundation for the next game.

693
00:35:28,233 --> 00:35:32,314
All right, so yeah, so just kind of, you know, quick, quick point to sort of wrap

694
00:35:32,314 --> 00:35:35,035
them, things together from my part and Justin's point, part.

695
00:35:35,035 --> 00:35:39,097
You know, I think there are two different approaches to marketing and I think some

696
00:35:39,097 --> 00:35:42,058
really great takeaways from Justin's presentation is, you know, a lot of

697
00:35:42,058 --> 00:35:45,959
persistence and, and creating things that could be leveraged for another program

698
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:49,820
later on and just being really open and nimble and flexible and, and thinking how

699
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,661
you could kind of keep things going and.

700
00:35:51,961 --> 00:35:54,082
you know, kind of forge your way to launch.

701
00:35:54,082 --> 00:35:56,503
And as Justin was saying too,

702
00:35:56,503 --> 00:35:58,904
they came out with the game, they got the rights back,

703
00:35:58,904 --> 00:36:00,425
they kind of keep plowing ahead,

704
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:01,945
you know, they kind of think about the longer tail

705
00:36:01,945 --> 00:36:03,406
as opposed to just the launch burst

706
00:36:03,406 --> 00:36:05,527
if it didn't go exactly how they wanted.

707
00:36:05,527 --> 00:36:07,428
And, you know, part of the end result is,

708
00:36:07,428 --> 00:36:10,089
you know, here we are post-launch

709
00:36:10,089 --> 00:36:11,309
and now they're working on their next game.

710
00:36:11,309 --> 00:36:13,410
So I think that's part of the vision of the indie world

711
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:15,491
is, you know, best case, your launch comes out

712
00:36:15,491 --> 00:36:16,711
and it fires on all cylinders,

713
00:36:16,711 --> 00:36:18,752
but kind of next best is, you know,

714
00:36:18,752 --> 00:36:21,413
you do well enough so you can keep going on to your next game.

715
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:27,120
Something else that comes out of the indie world is that it's a great community, and

716
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:32,605
I think there's great opportunities to think about programs that not only help your game,

717
00:36:32,605 --> 00:36:34,466
but also help other games.

718
00:36:34,466 --> 00:36:36,588
And I think it's excellent how people work together.

719
00:36:36,588 --> 00:36:38,309
And The Mix is a great example.

720
00:36:38,309 --> 00:36:41,692
As Justin was saying, he was working at IGN.

721
00:36:41,692 --> 00:36:47,016
GDC rolled around, and they said, hey, let's have some journalists in here, and let's get

722
00:36:47,016 --> 00:36:48,598
some other indie games, too.

723
00:36:48,598 --> 00:36:49,378
And here we are.

724
00:36:49,378 --> 00:36:50,179
So that was in 2012.

725
00:36:50,179 --> 00:36:51,880
Here we are years later.

726
00:36:52,448 --> 00:36:55,090
And that's really turned into a tremendous platform

727
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:57,412
for indie game developers.

728
00:36:57,412 --> 00:36:58,693
We do it every year now.

729
00:36:58,693 --> 00:37:01,895
And we have expanded from four events last year.

730
00:37:01,895 --> 00:37:04,577
We're planning to do six or seven this year,

731
00:37:04,577 --> 00:37:05,518
including E3.

732
00:37:05,518 --> 00:37:08,801
We're going to South by Southwest next week, Comic-Con,

733
00:37:08,801 --> 00:37:09,521
SIGGRAPH.

734
00:37:09,521 --> 00:37:13,464
And so we're doing things that not only help

735
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:15,385
some of the Justin's game and other games,

736
00:37:15,385 --> 00:37:18,488
but we're helping other indies and give them a platform.

737
00:37:19,056 --> 00:37:21,819
So that's kind of a little bit about the mix and how things tie together.

738
00:37:21,819 --> 00:37:24,382
And how we started working together was, I was thinking as a marketer,

739
00:37:24,382 --> 00:37:28,367
it's great to work with individual indies, but how could I do programs

740
00:37:28,367 --> 00:37:31,430
that benefit multiple people at the same time and get some efficiency?

741
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:35,435
So that's part of the connection with how our worlds have come together.

742
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:39,676
And it happens a number of times.

743
00:37:39,676 --> 00:37:40,937
It's been fantastic.

744
00:37:40,937 --> 00:37:45,320
The Humble Bundle started, as some of you may well know,

745
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,061
as that was Wolfire.

746
00:37:46,061 --> 00:37:47,462
And they were marketing their game.

747
00:37:47,462 --> 00:37:50,024
And they were inspired by what World of Goo

748
00:37:50,024 --> 00:37:51,825
did with the pay what you want.

749
00:37:51,825 --> 00:37:54,507
And things kind of evolved and evolved.

750
00:37:54,507 --> 00:37:56,669
And they were just thinking, hey, let's do a bundle.

751
00:37:56,669 --> 00:37:59,411
And then next thing you know, it was tremendously successful.

752
00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:00,452
And it became its own business.

753
00:38:03,121 --> 00:38:06,524
So, yeah, so that's one example.

754
00:38:06,524 --> 00:38:17,515
Yeah, some of the developers at the IGN in the open house, we started meetups and a lot

755
00:38:17,515 --> 00:38:22,880
of the developers came and cultivated and we worked together.

756
00:38:23,914 --> 00:38:30,760
contacted Tim Schafer and that presented an option to have an incubator there as well,

757
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:36,785
a double fine. Someone in the audience, Dylan, has Games Nest and that's blowing up too.

758
00:38:36,785 --> 00:38:40,448
And that's how some of the indies work together.

759
00:38:41,526 --> 00:38:44,828
So yeah, so I think it's interesting that you market

760
00:38:44,828 --> 00:38:46,349
your game, but as you're doing it,

761
00:38:46,349 --> 00:38:48,831
there could be opportunities that not only help your game,

762
00:38:48,831 --> 00:38:52,373
but also can benefit others in the community.

763
00:38:52,373 --> 00:38:56,016
I think a lot of people know about Rami Ismail's Press Kit.

764
00:38:56,016 --> 00:38:57,957
It was something he developed to start his game,

765
00:38:57,957 --> 00:39:01,380
but now a lot of people use it to help make their press

766
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,381
communications efficient.

767
00:39:03,381 --> 00:39:05,383
And there's some other examples here that I think

768
00:39:05,383 --> 00:39:06,203
people are familiar with.

769
00:39:06,203 --> 00:39:07,604
I'm going to segue into.

770
00:39:09,382 --> 00:39:14,148
one more example for you that is connected with this not on Steam icon that you see here.

771
00:39:14,148 --> 00:39:22,018
And this is a case of another studio that created their game.

772
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:27,160
released it and found that it didn't perform how they wanted.

773
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,561
And you'll see the first couple months,

774
00:39:29,561 --> 00:39:31,762
if this was you in your game studio,

775
00:39:31,762 --> 00:39:33,363
it might be a little bit discouraging.

776
00:39:33,363 --> 00:39:34,903
But they kept plowing ahead.

777
00:39:34,903 --> 00:39:37,864
And they were really tenacious and persistent.

778
00:39:37,864 --> 00:39:39,745
And I'll talk about some of the things

779
00:39:39,745 --> 00:39:41,726
they did to be successful.

780
00:39:41,726 --> 00:39:45,407
But one big takeaway here is that of their year one

781
00:39:45,407 --> 00:39:46,007
revenues.

782
00:39:46,594 --> 00:39:49,955
they got 90% of the revenue in months four through 12.

783
00:39:49,955 --> 00:39:53,636
So I think people might stereotypically think,

784
00:39:53,636 --> 00:39:54,877
you know, everything I'm going to make

785
00:39:54,877 --> 00:39:55,937
is going to be in the first month,

786
00:39:55,937 --> 00:39:56,777
or the first three months.

787
00:39:56,777 --> 00:39:57,998
And if I don't do it then, I'm sunk.

788
00:39:57,998 --> 00:40:00,338
And I think these guys are a great example.

789
00:40:00,338 --> 00:40:03,079
I don't know when they're speaking,

790
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:04,460
but they might have already spoken.

791
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,300
But if you hear GDC, if they're speaking tomorrow,

792
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,441
I would suggest check them out, and they'll

793
00:40:08,441 --> 00:40:12,002
talk more about what they did.

794
00:40:12,002 --> 00:40:14,223
And so, you know, so they launched.

795
00:40:14,223 --> 00:40:16,063
It didn't perform what they wanted.

796
00:40:16,943 --> 00:40:20,364
they did a blog on Gamasutra and on their own website.

797
00:40:20,364 --> 00:40:23,044
And it was one month later, losing Steam.

798
00:40:23,044 --> 00:40:25,985
And I think their takeaway was, we self-released,

799
00:40:25,985 --> 00:40:27,685
but we weren't able to get on Steam.

800
00:40:27,685 --> 00:40:29,466
And that's been a big part of why we're not

801
00:40:29,466 --> 00:40:30,626
performing how we want.

802
00:40:30,626 --> 00:40:31,806
That got some press attention.

803
00:40:31,806 --> 00:40:35,567
And Greenlight was going on.

804
00:40:35,567 --> 00:40:38,228
And they launched this.

805
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:39,748
I'm just going back to the icon real quick.

806
00:40:39,748 --> 00:40:41,508
They launched the Not On Steam sale.

807
00:40:41,508 --> 00:40:44,189
And that was their own creation.

808
00:40:44,189 --> 00:40:46,390
And they said, we're not on Steam.

809
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:49,691
And here's a whole bunch of other game developers that aren't on Steam,

810
00:40:49,691 --> 00:40:51,631
and how can we kind of come up with a program?"

811
00:40:51,631 --> 00:40:53,512
So they did what you know about Steam sales.

812
00:40:53,512 --> 00:40:55,273
They did discounted pricing.

813
00:40:55,273 --> 00:40:57,273
They had a Humble widget on there,

814
00:40:57,273 --> 00:41:00,194
so people can buy directly through this, not on Steam sale.

815
00:41:00,194 --> 00:41:03,556
And they also had a link to everyone's Greenlight page,

816
00:41:03,556 --> 00:41:05,356
so they can help kind of build their—

817
00:41:05,356 --> 00:41:07,177
fuel their Greenlight campaign.

818
00:41:07,177 --> 00:41:07,597
And, um...

819
00:41:08,837 --> 00:41:12,119
And so that really resonated.

820
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:14,261
Press found it interesting and they wrote about it.

821
00:41:14,261 --> 00:41:17,544
They had dozens of developers over the course of this promotion.

822
00:41:17,544 --> 00:41:20,686
And then the other thing that happened was not only did

823
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:24,429
Race the Sun get greenlit, but a number of other games got greenlit.

824
00:41:24,429 --> 00:41:26,911
And so you'll see this bump in December.

825
00:41:26,911 --> 00:41:29,313
And then they finally came out on Steam.

826
00:41:29,813 --> 00:41:31,735
They monetized it, they did really well.

827
00:41:31,735 --> 00:41:33,897
They kept plugging ahead.

828
00:41:33,897 --> 00:41:36,359
They decided to add Steam Workshop in March.

829
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:38,100
And that gave them another really nice bump

830
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,401
in their promotional pricing.

831
00:41:39,401 --> 00:41:42,704
And then they had other promotions as time went on.

832
00:41:42,704 --> 00:41:44,185
And they're continuing on, and they're

833
00:41:44,185 --> 00:41:47,208
getting ready for a PlayStation release and so on.

834
00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:49,290
So again, quick summary point here is just,

835
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:52,172
while it can be discouraging, sometimes

836
00:41:52,172 --> 00:41:53,813
there's some trial and error, and sometimes just

837
00:41:53,813 --> 00:41:55,655
kind of trying and experimenting with different things

838
00:41:55,655 --> 00:41:56,976
to go after success.

839
00:41:59,676 --> 00:42:02,057
Just kind of quickly here, this is just,

840
00:42:02,057 --> 00:42:04,517
we talked about channel, we talked about PR,

841
00:42:04,517 --> 00:42:05,718
this is just kind of really quickly,

842
00:42:05,718 --> 00:42:08,298
there's examples of people who have done well

843
00:42:08,298 --> 00:42:10,679
with advertising, there's some people who have done well

844
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:13,199
with releasing playable code with early access.

845
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:15,080
There's people who've achieved their success

846
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,520
through promotions, and not just price promotions,

847
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,521
but sometimes working with other indies

848
00:42:19,521 --> 00:42:22,721
to have compelling content, and PR.

849
00:42:22,721 --> 00:42:22,781
So,

850
00:42:23,842 --> 00:42:31,833
Some of these examples are written up in more detail on the link that I'm going to have in a couple slides, so you can read more about these.

851
00:42:31,833 --> 00:42:37,220
And in conclusion, just a couple of takeaways to take with you.

852
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:40,384
Going back to earlier points from the presentation, begin early.

853
00:42:42,085 --> 00:42:46,307
Be nimble, be flexible, the plan is very likely going to change.

854
00:42:46,307 --> 00:42:49,708
Be flexible, be nimble, and stay tenacious.

855
00:42:49,708 --> 00:42:50,688
Just go after it.

856
00:42:50,688 --> 00:42:51,409
This is important.

857
00:42:51,409 --> 00:42:55,590
You're spending months and years of your life in this game, working on this game.

858
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:57,151
Stay after it.

859
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:02,413
It can be discouraging sometimes, but tenacity will help you be successful.

860
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,014
And if not the first time, maybe the next time.

861
00:43:04,654 --> 00:43:06,976
We talked a lot about relationship building and networking.

862
00:43:06,976 --> 00:43:10,538
You know, Justin talked about how he was just so aggressive

863
00:43:10,538 --> 00:43:13,320
and persistent in talking to as many people as possible,

864
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,222
and you never know what's gonna pan out for you.

865
00:43:15,222 --> 00:43:16,763
So get out there, go to shows,

866
00:43:16,763 --> 00:43:19,505
cultivate your relationships,

867
00:43:19,505 --> 00:43:21,466
meet people in person as often as possible,

868
00:43:21,466 --> 00:43:23,968
and that can bear tremendous fruit for you.

869
00:43:24,108 --> 00:43:27,792
Have a mix of vehicles in your marketing plan.

870
00:43:27,792 --> 00:43:30,496
While it can be tempting to rely on just one thing,

871
00:43:30,496 --> 00:43:33,079
it's useful to have a balance so that if one thing doesn't fire,

872
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:35,722
you've got other things to support your program.

873
00:43:35,722 --> 00:43:40,307
And I'm sorry to end with a cliché, but it's a marathon, not a sprint.

874
00:43:40,307 --> 00:43:42,550
Just think about it in the long term.

875
00:43:44,763 --> 00:43:46,104
This would be a great place to take pictures,

876
00:43:46,104 --> 00:43:47,945
because these are some links where we've got a little bit

877
00:43:47,945 --> 00:43:48,726
more information.

878
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:50,468
I know this is going to be posted soon,

879
00:43:50,468 --> 00:43:52,750
but there's more examples from what

880
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:55,412
we talked about the presentation in the second link.

881
00:43:55,412 --> 00:43:57,233
So that's my blog.

882
00:43:57,233 --> 00:44:00,096
It's not super populated right now,

883
00:44:00,096 --> 00:44:03,138
but I've got some resources and some other links in there.

884
00:44:03,138 --> 00:44:06,561
The last URL here is Justin's studio in Terabang.

885
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:09,344
And mediainexchange.com is the events

886
00:44:09,344 --> 00:44:11,385
that we run together that we talked a little bit about.

887
00:44:12,757 --> 00:44:15,278
And with that, we have time.

888
00:44:15,278 --> 00:44:16,618
I'm just going to check my clock real quick.

889
00:44:16,618 --> 00:44:19,399
We have 15 minutes for questions.

890
00:44:19,399 --> 00:44:21,819
So invite people to come up to the microphone.

891
00:44:21,819 --> 00:44:27,360
And if you ask questions, please make

892
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,000
sure you ask your question in the microphone

893
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,861
so it'll be recorded for the video.

894
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:42,971
Is the microphone on for the audience?

895
00:44:46,306 --> 00:44:47,446
Doesn't seem to be.

896
00:44:47,446 --> 00:44:50,107
OK, there it goes.

897
00:44:50,107 --> 00:44:53,308
So briefly, right at the end, you mentioned early access.

898
00:44:53,308 --> 00:44:57,210
And early access, there seems to be a desire from it

899
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:57,870
on the consumer side.

900
00:44:57,870 --> 00:44:59,530
Like there have been several games

901
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,951
that have been really successful.

902
00:45:00,951 --> 00:45:05,632
It also seems to have tanked games when it's been botched.

903
00:45:05,632 --> 00:45:07,233
So I wondered if you had any more thoughts

904
00:45:07,233 --> 00:45:09,194
you could expand upon with early access

905
00:45:09,194 --> 00:45:11,534
and how it ties into marketing and eventual success

906
00:45:11,534 --> 00:45:11,954
of the game.

907
00:45:11,954 --> 00:45:13,815
Yeah, I think part of it is, if I can,

908
00:45:13,815 --> 00:45:15,876
I'm going to try and flip back real quick.

909
00:45:17,942 --> 00:45:18,843
is uh...

910
00:45:18,843 --> 00:45:25,588
if I could briefly like I think you gotta sometimes when you're looking at early access

911
00:45:25,588 --> 00:45:29,571
you gotta think of it like a kickstarter campaign

912
00:45:29,571 --> 00:45:34,694
some of your sales will migrate from the actual sales when you release the game

913
00:45:34,694 --> 00:45:38,017
to the early access so it won't dictate

914
00:45:38,017 --> 00:45:40,018
how the the margin of sales you'll get later

915
00:45:40,018 --> 00:45:41,419
does that make any sense?

916
00:45:41,419 --> 00:45:41,740
yes

917
00:45:43,913 --> 00:45:46,554
So, and you know, I think the point I was going to make with this slide is, you know,

918
00:45:46,554 --> 00:45:48,315
think about the shape of your marketing plan.

919
00:45:48,315 --> 00:45:52,957
If you do early access 12 months before you're really going to release the game, you know,

920
00:45:52,957 --> 00:45:55,638
you have the potential to lose momentum.

921
00:45:55,638 --> 00:46:00,500
And I think another thing that I, like Clay was talking about, how when they did early

922
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:04,062
access and were successful with something like Don't Starve, they had a really good

923
00:46:04,062 --> 00:46:06,983
schedule and communication plan about how they were doing it.

924
00:46:07,324 --> 00:46:12,206
I believe it was every month they had a new content release and they told people what they were doing and when they were going to do it.

925
00:46:12,206 --> 00:46:18,869
And there's a lot of things that made Don't Starve successful, but I think in terms of how they did early access, there's some good lessons learned there.

926
00:46:18,869 --> 00:46:22,590
I think it's important to think about having a good game experience.

927
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:24,411
I think some people might fall down with...

928
00:46:24,811 --> 00:46:27,112
putting a game on early access that's not representative

929
00:46:27,112 --> 00:46:28,972
of their final game, it creates a bad impression.

930
00:46:28,972 --> 00:46:30,973
And so that doesn't work well for them.

931
00:46:30,973 --> 00:46:33,454
So I think there's a lot of considerations that go into it.

932
00:46:33,454 --> 00:46:34,954
But I think the ones who have done it well,

933
00:46:34,954 --> 00:46:35,995
they think about their timing.

934
00:46:35,995 --> 00:46:37,855
They think about updates to communications.

935
00:46:37,855 --> 00:46:40,576
They think about the experience.

936
00:46:40,576 --> 00:46:42,777
So I think there's pros and cons.

937
00:46:42,777 --> 00:46:45,438
But when you do it well, you've got the opportunity

938
00:46:45,438 --> 00:46:47,898
to start generating revenue before you

939
00:46:47,898 --> 00:46:50,519
do the full game release and then can do kind of a polish.

940
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:51,780
Another quick thing there is.

941
00:46:53,485 --> 00:46:55,806
if all the content is there in early access,

942
00:46:55,806 --> 00:46:57,167
then there's kind of nothing to follow through on

943
00:46:57,167 --> 00:46:58,648
when you release the full game.

944
00:46:58,648 --> 00:47:01,029
So you want to think about that part of it.

945
00:47:01,029 --> 00:47:03,110
So when all those things work well,

946
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:04,450
then you can prepare yourself

947
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:07,172
for a successful launch afterwards.

948
00:47:07,172 --> 00:47:08,772
All right, thank you.

949
00:47:08,772 --> 00:47:09,913
Yep.

950
00:47:09,913 --> 00:47:11,254
Hello, thank you.

951
00:47:11,254 --> 00:47:12,334
This is strong.

952
00:47:12,334 --> 00:47:15,075
Thank you for the talk.

953
00:47:15,075 --> 00:47:18,497
I want to, I feel, I don't know how to ask this.

954
00:47:18,497 --> 00:47:20,978
I feel maybe for some people, I'm from Argentina,

955
00:47:20,978 --> 00:47:21,118
and

956
00:47:22,247 --> 00:47:31,096
Maybe I feel some of those tips are not reachable for us,

957
00:47:31,096 --> 00:47:35,861
because being on festivals, or maybe in GDC, for us

958
00:47:35,861 --> 00:47:42,548
it's really difficult. And when you need your resources

959
00:47:42,548 --> 00:47:44,530
to develop your game, it's really hard to.

960
00:47:46,164 --> 00:47:48,345
you know, use those resources for marketing.

961
00:47:48,345 --> 00:47:52,328
And the thing is, what do you think about,

962
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:56,151
you didn't talk too much about creativity, I think,

963
00:47:56,151 --> 00:47:59,533
because it's like, those are the ways of marketing

964
00:47:59,533 --> 00:48:03,736
your game, but I think there are a lot of more ways

965
00:48:03,736 --> 00:48:07,699
of marketing that doesn't exist yet, you know?

966
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:10,619
So I could talk about Supercommon Man.

967
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:12,320
So Supercommon Man was a fighter.

968
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:16,202
There's something called influencer marketing.

969
00:48:16,202 --> 00:48:18,843
And we geared a lot of our marketing

970
00:48:18,843 --> 00:48:20,824
towards the fighting game community.

971
00:48:20,824 --> 00:48:25,586
And we got top fighting game personalities to play our game.

972
00:48:25,586 --> 00:48:27,707
We showed at different fighting game

973
00:48:27,707 --> 00:48:29,488
festivals and tournaments.

974
00:48:29,488 --> 00:48:31,669
And we creatively tried to figure out

975
00:48:31,669 --> 00:48:33,970
where it would fit within that audience.

976
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:38,734
So yeah, you definitely, while you're marketing your game or anything, you got to think of like

977
00:48:38,734 --> 00:48:45,880
how to get in where you fit in, you know what I mean? Like, so to speak. So is that what you're

978
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:52,987
talking about as far as the creative aspects of... I mean, for example, do you know Dumb Boys Today?

979
00:48:52,987 --> 00:48:53,467
Yeah. Okay.

980
00:48:54,301 --> 00:49:02,925
the video was something that they created previously, but what if it were like the other, you know?

981
00:49:02,925 --> 00:49:07,167
I have the game done with today, and then I make the video.

982
00:49:07,167 --> 00:49:10,188
The video goes viral, and then I have my game.

983
00:49:10,188 --> 00:49:11,028
Yeah, I mean, I think...

984
00:49:11,028 --> 00:49:12,009
Different ways, you know?

985
00:49:12,009 --> 00:49:16,191
Yeah, if I'm getting your point, I think it's creative content is sort of a...

986
00:49:16,811 --> 00:49:18,372
a way of attracting people.

987
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:21,614
I mean, I've been talking about programs a lot,

988
00:49:21,614 --> 00:49:23,295
and you're talking about sometimes it's

989
00:49:23,295 --> 00:49:24,015
the creative content.

990
00:49:24,015 --> 00:49:28,958
Am I understanding your point correctly, the content?

991
00:49:28,958 --> 00:49:31,820
It's like I felt like that technique

992
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:35,602
of marketing your product, it was out of the talk.

993
00:49:35,602 --> 00:49:38,404
And I think creativity, when you don't have those resources,

994
00:49:38,404 --> 00:49:41,586
is the main thing you have to, as indie developers,

995
00:49:41,586 --> 00:49:43,887
creativity is our main strength.

996
00:49:44,432 --> 00:49:45,653
I think you're absolutely right.

997
00:49:45,653 --> 00:49:50,637
Sometimes you have just this incredibly compelling concept,

998
00:49:50,637 --> 00:49:53,639
and you have something that really resonates,

999
00:49:53,639 --> 00:49:56,081
and the job becomes a lot easier.

1000
00:49:56,081 --> 00:50:01,705
And sometimes you have this incredibly compelling piece

1001
00:50:01,705 --> 00:50:03,507
of marketing content.

1002
00:50:03,507 --> 00:50:05,848
Maybe it's like this great viral video,

1003
00:50:05,848 --> 00:50:09,271
or maybe it's a program.

1004
00:50:09,271 --> 00:50:10,752
So absolutely, I think there's.

1005
00:50:11,234 --> 00:50:13,775
There's tons of value in that, and thank you

1006
00:50:13,775 --> 00:50:15,035
for bringing that into the conversation.

1007
00:50:15,035 --> 00:50:17,856
If I can, I would just one more thing.

1008
00:50:17,856 --> 00:50:19,837
As game designers and developers,

1009
00:50:19,837 --> 00:50:24,498
I think we have to ask the game to marketing itself.

1010
00:50:24,498 --> 00:50:27,519
Like tools like Twitter, or I don't know.

1011
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:30,620
There's a lot of ways of making your game create content

1012
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:32,660
automatically by the user content,

1013
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:34,701
or other ways that you don't have

1014
00:50:34,701 --> 00:50:36,642
to work for creating that content.

1015
00:50:36,782 --> 00:51:05,805
Yeah. I mean, I think there's, you know, there's people who want to believe in the field of dreams, you know, where you, if you build it, they will come. And, and, uh, when you're lucky that works. But I think depending on that can be a challenge. And so I, I guess from a marketer perspective, I encourage you to, you know, to think about what else you could do. I mean, if you're lucky, it's great. And I, and I think also from the outside, it, it looks easier than it really is. You know, you, you see these great examples and you say, Oh, that was super easy for them. But in reality,

1016
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:11,939
they might have done like five games before that, or they might have done 20 other things

1017
00:51:11,939 --> 00:51:14,961
for that game before the thing really fired. So, yeah, so next question.

1018
00:51:14,961 --> 00:51:22,908
Hey guys. Holy, whoa. Good to see you. So you talked about all the things that you shouldn't

1019
00:51:22,908 --> 00:51:28,192
do, and we just released a game a little less than a month ago, and we did all of those

1020
00:51:28,192 --> 00:51:31,855
things. We didn't advertise it at all, and we built it and they haven't really come.

1021
00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:38,038
the big reason for that, oh by the way the game is called Blitz Keep, it's on IOS and Android,

1022
00:51:38,038 --> 00:51:43,179
go get it right now. Please. Okay. Thank you. It's creative right? That's what he's talking

1023
00:51:43,179 --> 00:51:49,181
about. It's a new thing. Anyway. So we work on it totally part time. That's kind of a big

1024
00:51:49,181 --> 00:51:54,143
challenge I've had. I've always been making indie games part time. And yeah, I've gone to

1025
00:51:54,143 --> 00:51:59,204
some of your events and stuff. And how do you really ever, is there kind of like,

1026
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:07,769
few things that you can do when you're someone who's working on a game 10 15 hours a week like to get this stuff rather than

1027
00:52:07,769 --> 00:52:15,233
You know someone who's got all of their time like would you say what's like the top things or something? Well, I'm gonna hire somebody

1028
00:52:16,344 --> 00:52:21,230
like Joel or John, there's a lot of people out there now that used to be, you know, full time

1029
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:25,695
marketers and now want to do it for indie game companies and they will take that off your

1030
00:52:25,695 --> 00:52:31,903
hands. Because that was an issue I had. I mean, I didn't market full time at all. You know, I

1031
00:52:31,903 --> 00:52:35,347
wanted to spend most of my time in production. I was producing full time.

1032
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,262
But I wanted to figure out different ways

1033
00:52:38,262 --> 00:52:40,383
to implement marking without me spending as much time.

1034
00:52:40,383 --> 00:52:42,444
So I completely understand what you're talking about.

1035
00:52:42,444 --> 00:52:45,407
And I think part of it is having the discipline to just,

1036
00:52:45,407 --> 00:52:47,388
even if you're not going to be spending

1037
00:52:47,388 --> 00:52:49,229
a lot of time executing, just having a discipline

1038
00:52:49,229 --> 00:52:49,870
to think about.

1039
00:52:50,855 --> 00:52:52,636
what do I want my marketing plan to be?

1040
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:54,899
Like, you have your milestones in development,

1041
00:52:54,899 --> 00:52:56,460
and you have your development tasks,

1042
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:58,242
and either you're doing it yourself

1043
00:52:58,242 --> 00:52:59,042
or someone's helping you,

1044
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:01,325
but having the discipline to say,

1045
00:53:01,325 --> 00:53:03,407
you know, six, nine, 12 months before launch,

1046
00:53:03,407 --> 00:53:04,307
what do I want to do?

1047
00:53:04,307 --> 00:53:06,169
And I might not have time to do it every week,

1048
00:53:06,169 --> 00:53:07,951
but you could at least think about the content,

1049
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:09,492
you could think about kind of the big beats,

1050
00:53:09,492 --> 00:53:10,393
I'm sorry I'm using another...

1051
00:53:10,733 --> 00:53:13,897
cliche, but you could, you know, think about what are the big beats you want to have.

1052
00:53:13,897 --> 00:53:20,424
And that can help, um, you know, it can help drive a program, even if you can't

1053
00:53:20,424 --> 00:53:21,666
spend a lot of time doing it.

1054
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:24,969
And then you think, you know, but I'm really going to like three months before

1055
00:53:24,969 --> 00:53:28,453
launch, I'm going to do X, Y, and Z, you know, the previous time I've only got 15

1056
00:53:28,453 --> 00:53:30,896
hours a week, I'm going to be developing like.

1057
00:53:31,691 --> 00:53:32,331
90% of the time.

1058
00:53:32,331 --> 00:53:35,272
But you would say, I'm going to do 10% on marketing.

1059
00:53:35,272 --> 00:53:37,373
And that'll give you some structure

1060
00:53:37,373 --> 00:53:41,235
and kind of an intelligent approach to it,

1061
00:53:41,235 --> 00:53:42,315
even if your time is limited.

1062
00:53:42,315 --> 00:53:43,796
And as Justin was saying, at some point,

1063
00:53:43,796 --> 00:53:46,397
maybe two months before launch or three months before launch,

1064
00:53:46,397 --> 00:53:49,238
I'm going to allocate some money to, if I can't do it myself,

1065
00:53:49,238 --> 00:53:50,178
have someone help me with it.

1066
00:53:50,178 --> 00:53:53,080
You could also have someone on your team spearhead it.

1067
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:56,001
Or work with, create a plan.

1068
00:53:56,001 --> 00:53:57,881
Spend like a week creating a plan.

1069
00:53:58,613 --> 00:54:04,180
for marketing and then have some interns help you with some of the social outreach, work

1070
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:11,831
with someone on Elance, and or have someone on your team who's really good at that, vocalizing

1071
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:13,994
that to help you with your marketing campaign.

1072
00:54:19,229 --> 00:54:27,654
Hello? Okay, good. How abstract or rigid should your marketing plan be when you're

1073
00:54:27,654 --> 00:54:33,357
developing or when you're brainstorming on it in the beginning of development? I was going to

1074
00:54:33,357 --> 00:54:39,320
say I think your plan should be really rigid but you should be flexible on your plan if that

1075
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:43,722
makes any sense. So you create a concrete plan. Right, you create a guideline.

1076
00:54:44,065 --> 00:54:47,889
It's just, yeah, you create guidelines and you have to iterate on it. It's just like game

1077
00:54:47,889 --> 00:54:51,673
production. It's just another aspect of game production. When you create your plan for

1078
00:54:51,673 --> 00:54:56,918
producing a game, you're going to have an idea and a vision of what you want, but you're never

1079
00:54:56,918 --> 00:55:00,182
going to stick to that. Because you know some things aren't going to work, the timing doesn't

1080
00:55:00,182 --> 00:55:02,124
work, the press that you wanted to

1081
00:55:02,861 --> 00:55:07,323
to look at your game, aren't going to look at it when you want it, but at least you have these guidelines to go by.

1082
00:55:07,323 --> 00:55:10,325
And then you, you know, adjust accordingly.

1083
00:55:10,325 --> 00:55:17,488
Yeah, I think there's very few marketing plans that I've done that have held up from like development time to execution time.

1084
00:55:18,049 --> 00:55:23,436
You know, almost all the time, you know, date shift or detail shift and, you know, great

1085
00:55:23,436 --> 00:55:27,461
military quote is, you know, there's very few battle plans that survive contact with

1086
00:55:27,461 --> 00:55:27,942
the enemy.

1087
00:55:27,942 --> 00:55:31,567
You know, it's the same kind of thing that create a plan, give yourself structure, but

1088
00:55:31,567 --> 00:55:34,110
it's just the same, be flexible and be ready to...

1089
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:37,734
you know, adjust it as you go. Yeah, you would drive yourself crazy if you just create a plan.

1090
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:41,097
You're like, oh, this isn't working. You know what I mean? You can't force stuff. You got to go

1091
00:55:41,097 --> 00:55:44,340
with the flow. And I think development is probably the same way. I don't know anything about it as a

1092
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:47,804
developer, but I suspect, you know, that same kind of mentality is useful. It's exactly the same.

1093
00:55:47,804 --> 00:55:50,246
Yeah. All right. Thank you. Yep. Thanks. Hey, guys. Great talk.

1094
00:55:54,829 --> 00:55:58,730
I'm currently building a fairly hardcore PC title,

1095
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:02,811
and I find most marketing resources are geared

1096
00:56:02,811 --> 00:56:07,872
towards casual and mobile game sort of platforms,

1097
00:56:07,872 --> 00:56:10,773
where I think the consumers are much less educated

1098
00:56:10,773 --> 00:56:12,353
about the product they're buying,

1099
00:56:12,353 --> 00:56:15,674
and can be much more influenced by marketing.

1100
00:56:15,674 --> 00:56:17,514
You talked about Super Combo Man

1101
00:56:17,514 --> 00:56:20,115
being more on the hardcore side.

1102
00:56:20,115 --> 00:56:23,016
Have you got any other tips for influencing

1103
00:56:23,016 --> 00:56:24,736
the more hardcore market?

1104
00:56:24,996 --> 00:56:33,060
I think that's changing and you know casual was where mobile was and now that's shifting to more hardcore

1105
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:39,103
you can see it in the Korean and Japanese markets and you're getting a lot more people who used to work in the industry

1106
00:56:39,103 --> 00:56:43,585
that want to help market hardcore games. You got to kind of figure your niche.

1107
00:56:44,026 --> 00:56:48,748
And so I've been working part-time as an influencer

1108
00:56:48,748 --> 00:56:49,488
marketer.

1109
00:56:49,488 --> 00:56:53,149
And what that means is working with YouTubers and Twitch

1110
00:56:53,149 --> 00:56:57,191
streamers and people in the Vine community, Instagram community,

1111
00:56:57,191 --> 00:56:59,831
to help boost up your community for your game.

1112
00:56:59,831 --> 00:57:04,613
So you've got to kind of figure the different chess pieces

1113
00:57:04,613 --> 00:57:05,613
that will help boost.

1114
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:12,365
the visibility of your game. And if you create a plan, you could work with someone like Joel,

1115
00:57:12,365 --> 00:57:17,148
or I keep like, you know, boosting him up, but you could work with someone who's strategic

1116
00:57:17,148 --> 00:57:24,033
that can help that, help you with that. When I was working with Adult Swim, just an example

1117
00:57:24,033 --> 00:57:27,275
of when I was working with them, they were just shooting it out to every,

1118
00:57:27,583 --> 00:57:29,704
Twitch streamer and it like that didn't really help us.

1119
00:57:29,704 --> 00:57:37,126
So I was, I had to, I actually formulated a plan that I wanted to work with them on

1120
00:57:37,126 --> 00:57:39,166
that would shoot it to, to the right trajectory.

1121
00:57:39,166 --> 00:57:43,707
Unfortunately we did it a little late, but when, if you're even thinking about

1122
00:57:43,707 --> 00:57:48,168
working with a publisher or outside, you should kind of cultivate a vision of

1123
00:57:48,168 --> 00:57:53,450
where you're, who your gamer is and you want to connect with that person.

1124
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:56,390
So, you know, personality is key in figuring out how you want to.

1125
00:57:56,782 --> 00:58:00,960
relate to them and connect with them with different influencers in the market.

1126
00:58:01,263 --> 00:58:05,384
Yeah, so this, um, you know, in terms of YouTubers, there's this, uh, YouTubers

1127
00:58:05,384 --> 00:58:09,764
mega list that, um, I have a, I have a link from it on the, the indie game, uh,

1128
00:58:09,764 --> 00:58:10,625
IndieMarketer.com.

1129
00:58:10,625 --> 00:58:13,785
Um, so that's a tremendous resource.

1130
00:58:13,785 --> 00:58:18,046
It's got, um, all the, a lot of YouTubers by follower size.

1131
00:58:18,046 --> 00:58:20,327
It's got contact information you could get, and it also talks

1132
00:58:20,327 --> 00:58:21,787
about genres they follow.

1133
00:58:21,787 --> 00:58:25,247
Um, events can be super useful for getting to core gamers.

1134
00:58:25,247 --> 00:58:26,948
You know, PAX is amazing.

1135
00:58:27,224 --> 00:58:30,865
The Indie Megabooth at PAX is a great avenue to get there.

1136
00:58:30,865 --> 00:58:33,507
PR is another great way to reach core gamers.

1137
00:58:33,507 --> 00:58:36,448
Again, it's like, can you get through to them, I think,

1138
00:58:36,448 --> 00:58:39,989
is it can be challenging, but it's important.

1139
00:58:39,989 --> 00:58:41,350
So it's worth the attention, but also

1140
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:43,150
have other things in your marketing mix

1141
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:44,451
that can help supplement you if you're not

1142
00:58:44,451 --> 00:58:45,311
getting the coverage.

1143
00:58:45,311 --> 00:58:48,993
I think we might have one last question we could cover,

1144
00:58:48,993 --> 00:58:51,534
and then we're going to get to the end of our time.

1145
00:58:51,534 --> 00:58:52,614
Or are we out of time?

1146
00:58:52,614 --> 00:58:52,834
One more.

1147
00:58:53,815 --> 00:58:54,275
Time or no?

1148
00:58:54,275 --> 00:58:56,876
Oh, yeah, we have time for the last question.

1149
00:58:56,876 --> 00:58:58,417
What's a good percentage of your budget

1150
00:58:58,417 --> 00:59:00,558
to dedicate towards a launch?

1151
00:59:00,558 --> 00:59:03,900
Traditional would be 10% to 15%.

1152
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:05,361
For marketing is your question, right?

1153
00:59:05,361 --> 00:59:08,042
Yeah, just for the launch or the whole year?

1154
00:59:08,042 --> 00:59:11,724
Well, I would say marketing 10% to 15% of what

1155
00:59:11,724 --> 00:59:16,467
you want your revenues to be is the way I would approach it.

1156
00:59:16,467 --> 00:59:18,088
Like, what's my target revenues?

1157
00:59:18,088 --> 00:59:19,269
And then carve out 10% to 15%.

1158
00:59:19,269 --> 00:59:23,131
That's sort of a formula that's used in the marketing world.

1159
00:59:23,131 --> 00:59:23,631
And.

1160
00:59:24,139 --> 00:59:26,499
But I'm sorry, before revenue.

1161
00:59:26,499 --> 00:59:27,280
Before revenue.

1162
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,760
I think budget.

1163
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,540
It'd be 10% to 15% of your budget, straight up.

1164
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:32,701
That's why I was trying to figure out,

1165
00:59:32,701 --> 00:59:35,221
when I was working with my marketing plan,

1166
00:59:35,221 --> 00:59:37,201
it really brought light to that.

1167
00:59:37,201 --> 00:59:38,742
I was like, oh, shit.

1168
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:39,762
Oh, crap, sorry.

1169
00:59:39,762 --> 00:59:42,102
But from a practical point of view,

1170
00:59:42,102 --> 00:59:44,302
I think there's so many startup studios that they're

1171
00:59:44,302 --> 00:59:48,303
bootstrap, and they're living day to day and week to week.

1172
00:59:48,303 --> 00:59:52,864
And the majority of the time, there's

1173
00:59:52,864 --> 00:59:53,624
people just.

1174
00:59:54,097 --> 00:59:55,917
and they don't have the budget to support it.

1175
00:59:55,917 --> 00:59:58,757
So that's why the programs that we talked about here

1176
00:59:58,757 --> 01:00:01,698
and the programs that will often get executed are,

1177
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:03,718
you know, I try and go for lean programs.

1178
01:00:03,718 --> 01:00:05,599
I mean, I'm used to working in bigger studios

1179
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:08,159
and I had to sort of adapt my approach

1180
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:09,180
when I'm working with indies.

1181
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:12,200
And what is the AAA budget for like a launch?

1182
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,341
Well, again, that's like the 10 to 15%

1183
01:00:14,341 --> 01:00:16,881
of expected revenues is the number

1184
01:00:16,881 --> 01:00:19,382
that I would work on in that world, so.

1185
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:21,422
So same for an indie?

1186
01:00:21,422 --> 01:00:22,182
Yeah.

1187
01:00:22,182 --> 01:00:22,662
Okay.

1188
01:00:22,662 --> 01:00:22,822
Yeah.

1189
01:00:23,627 --> 01:00:27,332
So I want to remind you to please fill out your evaluations.

1190
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:30,095
They're super useful to us as well as GDC.

1191
01:00:30,095 --> 01:00:33,800
I think you'll be getting an email right after this session,

1192
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,743
so I encourage you to please do that.

1193
01:00:35,743 --> 01:00:37,806
And we'll stick around for a few minutes.

1194
01:00:37,806 --> 01:00:38,847
And thank you all for coming.
