1
00:00:04,412 --> 00:00:09,734
Welcome to the final day and final session in GDC 2017.

2
00:00:10,955 --> 00:00:15,017
So this is Epic and Interactive Music in Final Fantasy XV.

3
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:17,898
I'm really honored to be here and

4
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:20,253
Oh, it's crowded.

5
00:00:22,054 --> 00:00:25,315
Actually, how many of you guys are not audio guys?

6
00:00:25,335 --> 00:00:28,796
How many of you guys are not doing audio stuff?

7
00:00:29,156 --> 00:00:30,877
Oh, thank you very much.

8
00:00:31,437 --> 00:00:33,498
So you guys are coming because of Final Fantasy?

9
00:00:33,758 --> 00:00:35,839
So how many of you played this game?

10
00:00:36,819 --> 00:00:37,579
Yeah, great.

11
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,780
And how many of you finished?

12
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,641
Wow, that's great.

13
00:00:42,161 --> 00:00:45,342
OK, so today.

14
00:00:46,572 --> 00:00:49,373
I will talk about the interactive music features

15
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:52,715
in Final Fantasy XV, tools and technique

16
00:00:52,955 --> 00:00:54,376
we use to achieve them.

17
00:00:55,237 --> 00:00:57,178
And finally, the issues we faced

18
00:00:57,838 --> 00:01:00,880
when synchronizing music to the game.

19
00:01:02,961 --> 00:01:06,003
I will not talk about the composing technique or story

20
00:01:06,263 --> 00:01:07,644
because I'm not a composer.

21
00:01:09,284 --> 00:01:12,286
But I think there are some of composers

22
00:01:12,326 --> 00:01:14,707
who worked with Final Fantasy here.

23
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:16,622
Maybe, no?

24
00:01:17,563 --> 00:01:19,284
Maybe they will, but so,

25
00:01:19,304 --> 00:01:22,466
I will introduce them at the end of the talk.

26
00:01:23,427 --> 00:01:26,669
So, let me introduce myself.

27
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,011
My name is Sho Iwamoto.

28
00:01:29,551 --> 00:01:33,594
I'm an audio programmer at Square Enix from 2014.

29
00:01:34,575 --> 00:01:36,116
I developed MAGI system,

30
00:01:37,016 --> 00:01:39,518
the interactive music system for our audio engine.

31
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:43,721
So since I entered Square Enix in just two years ago,

32
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,722
From where I studied developed Magi system,

33
00:01:46,922 --> 00:01:51,107
the music of Final Fantasy XV was partly finished

34
00:01:51,728 --> 00:01:55,232
because, you know, the game previously named

35
00:01:55,332 --> 00:01:58,335
as Final Fantasy Versus XIII has,

36
00:01:59,096 --> 00:02:02,781
in that trailer, already has iconic musics such as.

37
00:02:25,058 --> 00:02:27,200
Yeah, that was before I entered Square Enix,

38
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,003
so Epic as a help.

39
00:02:31,043 --> 00:02:34,466
So I, as a developer of this MAGI system,

40
00:02:35,047 --> 00:02:37,709
got involved in the game development team

41
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:41,052
and taking the role of designing and implementing

42
00:02:41,532 --> 00:02:43,874
interactive music system for Final Fantasy XV.

43
00:02:45,475 --> 00:02:49,179
At first, it was like a crash of Epic music

44
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:51,160
and interactive system.

45
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,363
How can I make this music interactive

46
00:02:57,203 --> 00:02:59,385
while maintaining their epic melodies?

47
00:03:00,405 --> 00:03:03,207
So making music interactive could change

48
00:03:03,507 --> 00:03:05,389
or even screw up the music itself,

49
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:09,291
or making music not memorable enough.

50
00:03:11,573 --> 00:03:14,475
The thinking about our Final Fantasy music,

51
00:03:14,935 --> 00:03:15,936
I mean, in the series,

52
00:03:16,836 --> 00:03:19,378
a lot of work done with Uematsu-san,

53
00:03:19,578 --> 00:03:20,919
and this time Shimomura-san,

54
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:21,099
but...

55
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:31,960
They are epic and has a number of memorable themes and has many orchestral concerts around the world, you know,

56
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,202
and has strong melody line most of the time.

57
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:42,228
And I think the music itself is kind of one of the sales point of this game.

58
00:03:42,468 --> 00:03:46,952
So I don't want to lose these good parts of this music.

59
00:03:49,473 --> 00:03:53,236
So our goal is to make epic and interactive music

60
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:55,437
for wide and seamless gameplay.

61
00:03:56,798 --> 00:03:59,099
You know, Final Fantasy series are also known

62
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:02,281
as challenging new systems and technology.

63
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:07,144
And this time we headed to open world and seamless gameplay.

64
00:04:07,784 --> 00:04:10,546
So it means that music should do the same,

65
00:04:11,966 --> 00:04:15,208
seamless transition, but should not losing its epicness.

66
00:04:16,349 --> 00:04:19,590
So this is the goal and move down to our concept.

67
00:04:21,691 --> 00:04:23,292
Okay, so this is a slide for me.

68
00:04:23,872 --> 00:04:26,013
Calm down, show, and speak slowly.

69
00:04:26,954 --> 00:04:28,754
Take water, okay?

70
00:04:35,917 --> 00:04:38,178
So first of all, I want to clarify that

71
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:41,440
the reason we decided to implement interactive music

72
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,161
is not for reduce repetition.

73
00:04:46,707 --> 00:04:48,868
Repeating music is not evil.

74
00:04:49,868 --> 00:04:51,789
Of course, it could be annoying sometimes.

75
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:55,811
But everyone loves to repeat their favorite music.

76
00:04:57,231 --> 00:05:00,913
And also, repetition makes the music much more memorable.

77
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:06,815
Instead, we use that to enhance the user's emotional experience

78
00:05:07,935 --> 00:05:11,697
by playing music that is most suitable to the situation.

79
00:05:13,097 --> 00:05:15,038
And one more thing, make transitions.

80
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:17,964
musical as much as possible.

81
00:05:20,325 --> 00:05:24,508
To be specific, for bidirectional change,

82
00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:27,751
where situation can move back and forth freely,

83
00:05:28,471 --> 00:05:29,792
we use vertical remixing,

84
00:05:30,573 --> 00:05:33,455
because you can easily move back and forth

85
00:05:34,215 --> 00:05:38,038
the vertical layer in any musical situation, basically.

86
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:43,222
On the other hand, for unidirectional progress,

87
00:05:44,147 --> 00:05:46,070
we use horizontal re-sequencing.

88
00:05:47,151 --> 00:05:51,739
This way, the music will flow from A to B and B to C

89
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:55,485
and so on musically as it was composed.

90
00:05:56,981 --> 00:06:00,124
So just in case maybe some of you guys are,

91
00:06:00,585 --> 00:06:02,086
many of you guys are not audio guy,

92
00:06:02,807 --> 00:06:05,230
the vertical and horizontal is kind of

93
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,832
interactive music words.

94
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:11,036
And maybe it was just confusing.

95
00:06:12,117 --> 00:06:13,038
Let's make it clear.

96
00:06:13,318 --> 00:06:17,362
The vertical is changing what vertical layer

97
00:06:17,562 --> 00:06:18,483
you play or mute.

98
00:06:20,161 --> 00:06:28,815
by remixing and horizontal is changing horizontal time or horizontal sequence of the music by

99
00:06:28,915 --> 00:06:29,637
re-sequencing.

100
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:33,323
So I use these two words in this session.

101
00:06:35,335 --> 00:06:38,957
Then here is the list of features we've implemented.

102
00:06:39,798 --> 00:06:43,440
So I will go into the details, some of these features,

103
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,601
in this session, but before that,

104
00:06:46,001 --> 00:06:49,163
let's see a video of very basic examples

105
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,844
that these features were used.

106
00:06:52,565 --> 00:06:53,366
Real nice here.

107
00:06:54,006 --> 00:06:54,567
Yeah.

108
00:06:58,889 --> 00:06:59,970
How about we grab a bite?

109
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,351
Yeah, let's do it.

110
00:07:05,822 --> 00:07:06,442
Come with us, Nacht!

111
00:07:06,462 --> 00:07:18,313
There's more dangerous things prowling about these days.

112
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:27,361
Sir, try this on for size.

113
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,285
The game's on.

114
00:07:41,126 --> 00:07:48,687
Yeah!

115
00:07:48,947 --> 00:07:51,987
You're out!

116
00:07:52,828 --> 00:07:54,348
It's over!

117
00:07:54,428 --> 00:07:59,989
Hey, are we all still here?

118
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:06,590
Yep.

119
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:08,750
Ignis!

120
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:51,736
Okay, so to achieve these features,

121
00:08:52,457 --> 00:08:54,599
I've developed the system called MAGI.

122
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,544
It stands for Music API for Gaming Interaction.

123
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:03,948
The features of this system is,

124
00:09:04,909 --> 00:09:08,732
first, enables vertical and horizontal transition,

125
00:09:09,493 --> 00:09:10,714
because, you know, it's basic.

126
00:09:11,495 --> 00:09:12,096
And second,

127
00:09:13,277 --> 00:09:16,460
It needs to accept any tempo or time signature

128
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,781
and the changes in the music.

129
00:09:20,182 --> 00:09:23,565
I think, despite the fact that not many interactive music

130
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:28,008
systems support this, I believe this is really important.

131
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,672
To setting up the tempo and time signatures

132
00:09:32,732 --> 00:09:37,495
can be done by hand, but it's maybe troublesome.

133
00:09:37,635 --> 00:09:39,937
So we had a MIDI import function.

134
00:09:41,733 --> 00:09:43,874
Just by dropping the midi file to 02,

135
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:47,677
tempo and time signatures are set automatically.

136
00:09:49,158 --> 00:09:51,500
And lastly, easy to use.

137
00:09:52,481 --> 00:09:56,704
Because we will use very simple and basic approaches,

138
00:09:57,304 --> 00:10:00,787
I want to make it easier than versatile.

139
00:10:02,465 --> 00:10:06,406
So here's our OSILINK tool for interacting with music.

140
00:10:07,647 --> 00:10:10,248
And this is our proprietary tool.

141
00:10:10,848 --> 00:10:14,250
And I guess most of you here will not have a chance to use

142
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:18,612
this, but I will use this tool through the demo.

143
00:10:19,132 --> 00:10:24,134
So please take a look at how we can implement music easily

144
00:10:24,694 --> 00:10:25,795
and iterate rapidly.

145
00:10:27,035 --> 00:10:29,497
So let's take a look at our tool.

146
00:10:30,457 --> 00:10:30,797
Here it is.

147
00:10:33,527 --> 00:10:37,108
So this is the view of interactive music,

148
00:10:37,368 --> 00:10:40,469
and everything you need to authorize is in this view.

149
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:45,430
So left side is list of musics,

150
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,570
and right side is all of what is

151
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,151
in an interactive piece of music.

152
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:55,072
To test a transition, just hit spacebar and play. ♪♪

153
00:11:00,853 --> 00:11:02,373
Select others and hit spacebar.

154
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:08,790
That's it.

155
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:15,276
And to test vertical remixing,

156
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:24,124
just throw a mode in here, top of this.

157
00:11:26,826 --> 00:11:29,769
And just select other mode from these tabs.

158
00:11:42,962 --> 00:11:44,903
And the parameters of these modes

159
00:11:45,224 --> 00:11:47,085
are usually folded behind here.

160
00:11:48,947 --> 00:11:50,888
And other options or customization

161
00:11:51,008 --> 00:11:53,250
is also folded in here or here.

162
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:57,133
So again, everything you need to authorize is in this view.

163
00:11:58,915 --> 00:12:03,299
So now, let's take a look at how to implement music

164
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:06,041
into the game by using this tool.

165
00:12:14,117 --> 00:12:16,278
So first is vertical remixing.

166
00:12:16,918 --> 00:12:18,959
We call that mode transition.

167
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,740
What is mode?

168
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,042
Mode is shortly the set of layer volumes.

169
00:12:25,742 --> 00:12:28,783
It lets you play or mute each of the layered tracks.

170
00:12:30,344 --> 00:12:33,965
And also you may have other parameters

171
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:37,266
like total volume or pitch or low-pass filter, et cetera.

172
00:12:39,147 --> 00:12:40,748
And in this mode view,

173
00:12:41,853 --> 00:12:45,316
The lower half of this is a transitional parameter,

174
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:49,178
such as fade time, fade offset, fade curve, and sync type,

175
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:50,479
and stinger.

176
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,121
So back to your tool.

177
00:12:56,123 --> 00:12:57,503
So here is the mode tab.

178
00:12:58,804 --> 00:13:05,429
And you can play each layer just by clicking mute button.

179
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:07,990
And on and off.

180
00:13:08,491 --> 00:13:08,951
Gorgeous.

181
00:13:12,086 --> 00:13:13,206
adjusting the volume,

182
00:13:16,568 --> 00:13:18,388
and adjust the fade curve over here,

183
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:21,349
like that.

184
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:27,251
Okay, so let's move on more concrete example.

185
00:13:29,752 --> 00:13:31,713
We use mode transition in Chocobo.

186
00:13:32,633 --> 00:13:35,434
The mode is changed according to Chocobo's speed.

187
00:13:36,755 --> 00:13:37,555
So there is...

188
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,940
Here is Chocobo's song in run mode. ♪♪

189
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:47,962
Maybe you heard a thousand times.

190
00:13:48,882 --> 00:13:50,423
And walk mode. ♪♪

191
00:13:55,264 --> 00:13:58,425
Okay, so let's see the transition of this.

192
00:14:23,232 --> 00:14:23,294
you

193
00:14:59,471 --> 00:15:01,973
And there is a little challenge about this.

194
00:15:02,894 --> 00:15:06,177
As you can see, Chocobo can go nearly anywhere.

195
00:15:06,838 --> 00:15:09,580
That makes the speed of Chocobo quite shaky,

196
00:15:10,321 --> 00:15:13,123
because Chocobo is not only running on a flat land.

197
00:15:14,785 --> 00:15:17,167
So if the speed of Chocobo is reflected

198
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:18,788
directly to the music,

199
00:15:19,469 --> 00:15:21,911
the transition would be kind of messy.

200
00:15:22,932 --> 00:15:25,793
So I want to hear the music, but I don't want to hear

201
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:29,375
the transition of the music every time I bump into trees

202
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:31,236
or I just turn around.

203
00:15:32,376 --> 00:15:33,877
So let's see the implementation.

204
00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:39,360
To avoid the messy transition,

205
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,461
I set it transition time longer.

206
00:15:42,321 --> 00:15:45,282
I set it from run to walk transition.

207
00:15:46,203 --> 00:15:48,084
There is a four bar transition time.

208
00:15:48,204 --> 00:15:48,404
So.

209
00:16:00,546 --> 00:16:04,568
So four bars transition time.

210
00:16:05,528 --> 00:16:06,188
It's really slow.

211
00:16:07,088 --> 00:16:10,310
And then, if you try to transition back and forth,

212
00:16:15,872 --> 00:16:19,093
maybe you almost can't hear the transition.

213
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:24,355
Maybe bumping into trees, or just curving.

214
00:16:24,435 --> 00:16:27,756
It's not so messy, okay?

215
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:33,691
But long transition means late feedback.

216
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:40,953
So actually, we use different transition time for each mode.

217
00:16:41,673 --> 00:16:46,035
Longer transition from run to walk, and shorter transition

218
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:47,075
from walk to run.

219
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:49,396
OK, let's check it.

220
00:16:50,896 --> 00:16:55,277
From walk to run, we use six units.

221
00:16:58,274 --> 00:17:07,701
transition time. It means one and a half beats. So just quick. Sorry.

222
00:17:19,229 --> 00:17:25,893
And you can see and edit each transition curve over here. Transition time

223
00:17:26,899 --> 00:17:29,260
to walk and transition time to run.

224
00:17:32,062 --> 00:17:34,925
And it looks like similar of each other,

225
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:38,968
but actually they has a different time unit.

226
00:17:40,289 --> 00:17:42,230
And you can select time unit from here.

227
00:17:42,951 --> 00:17:47,674
It may be bars or beats or 16th notes

228
00:17:48,175 --> 00:17:49,276
or samples or seconds.

229
00:17:50,076 --> 00:17:54,740
So I use bars unit for longer transition, four bars.

230
00:17:55,838 --> 00:18:00,773
And I use 16s nodes units for shorter transition.

231
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:02,899
So that makes this difference.

232
00:18:23,967 --> 00:18:25,648
So why I made this difference?

233
00:18:25,988 --> 00:18:30,271
Because the player doesn't always intentionally stop running.

234
00:18:31,752 --> 00:18:33,293
Simply bumping into something

235
00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:36,916
or making turn will stop Chocobo, but not vice versa.

236
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:40,498
Pressing the R trigger is going to make Chocobo run,

237
00:18:40,598 --> 00:18:42,700
so it is all player's will.

238
00:18:44,681 --> 00:18:47,423
So it's because of player's intention or not.

239
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,966
I believe this implementation is the best way

240
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:52,707
to reflect player's control.

241
00:18:55,847 --> 00:18:59,510
And so this is how we avoid annoying transition

242
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,752
while having quick music feedback.

243
00:19:04,133 --> 00:19:07,195
However, when a player lies at chocobo,

244
00:19:07,935 --> 00:19:11,057
he or she probably wants to get somewhere quick,

245
00:19:11,758 --> 00:19:15,360
indicating that the chocobo will be running most of the time.

246
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:20,523
So actually, there's few chance to hear the slow version,

247
00:19:20,803 --> 00:19:23,926
maybe, except for swimming.

248
00:19:25,073 --> 00:19:31,038
As you saw, while Choco is swimming, walking mode becomes active. So that is a good chance to enjoy

249
00:19:31,158 --> 00:19:41,367
walk mode of Choco music. Okay, so let's move on. Next case is Garden Quay. Garden Quay is a

250
00:19:41,467 --> 00:19:49,294
seaside outpost and the building you can see at the end of this pier is a restaurant. The music

251
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:52,817
changes between this gorgeous restaurant and relaxing seaside.

252
00:19:54,062 --> 00:19:57,145
It's one of my favorite.

253
00:19:57,185 --> 00:19:58,026
Seaside version.

254
00:19:58,046 --> 00:20:02,550
And restaurant version.

255
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:03,911
Okay, let's see.

256
00:21:21,427 --> 00:21:24,388
Okay, so this is also a vertical remixing,

257
00:21:25,189 --> 00:21:28,150
more transition, but not just crossfading.

258
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,731
It's based on the musical timing.

259
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:38,933
I know it's basic thing, but because as you hear this music,

260
00:21:42,235 --> 00:21:42,375
see.

261
00:21:57,027 --> 00:22:00,810
You can see that musical accent is on nearly every two bars.

262
00:22:01,691 --> 00:22:05,394
So I want to make transition in sync with this musical accent.

263
00:22:06,735 --> 00:22:12,119
So for mode transition information here,

264
00:22:12,139 --> 00:22:17,063
I set this sync type to next two bar.

265
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:23,128
So that makes the transition occurs around the next two bars.

266
00:22:24,211 --> 00:22:35,629
And in this setting, the transition starts two beats before the next two bars and ends at the next two bars.

267
00:22:35,649 --> 00:22:36,611
So that makes this...

268
00:23:20,703 --> 00:23:24,246
Okay, so by making transition in sync with musical accent,

269
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:27,989
it sounds as if not just crossfading,

270
00:23:28,069 --> 00:23:31,932
but instead it gives like the impression of

271
00:23:32,893 --> 00:23:35,916
as if a pianist and a drummer playing along your game

272
00:23:36,476 --> 00:23:37,977
and make the musical change.

273
00:23:38,738 --> 00:23:43,122
So, just one thing you need to keep in mind

274
00:23:43,182 --> 00:23:45,303
about this transition is that

275
00:23:45,684 --> 00:23:48,006
this causes two bars wait sometimes.

276
00:23:48,766 --> 00:23:49,247
And button.

277
00:23:50,248 --> 00:23:52,329
In this case, it's not a problem.

278
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:56,950
Okay, wrap up the mode transition.

279
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:01,432
We use different transition time for each mode

280
00:24:01,552 --> 00:24:03,652
in Chocobo run and walk transition,

281
00:24:03,953 --> 00:24:08,214
and we use transition on musical timing in Garlin Quay.

282
00:24:12,475 --> 00:24:14,156
So that's it for vertical remixing,

283
00:24:14,256 --> 00:24:16,517
and next is horizontal re-sequencing.

284
00:24:17,317 --> 00:24:19,318
We call that section transition.

285
00:24:20,373 --> 00:24:20,733
in MAGI.

286
00:24:22,154 --> 00:24:24,896
So section makes musical progression

287
00:24:25,637 --> 00:24:29,560
and there are parameters of section transition

288
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,602
such as fade in and fade out and fade curve

289
00:24:33,262 --> 00:24:36,085
and entry point is here.

290
00:24:37,866 --> 00:24:41,128
Entry point is our start point of each section.

291
00:24:41,969 --> 00:24:44,010
So if you transition from A to B,

292
00:24:44,511 --> 00:24:47,973
section B is always starts from around the entry point.

293
00:24:49,324 --> 00:24:52,286
So back to O2, let's see this.

294
00:24:53,486 --> 00:24:57,529
So each of these tracks are the section.

295
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:04,453
And you can adjust the fade in and out curve over here,

296
00:25:05,093 --> 00:25:05,473
like this.

297
00:25:06,754 --> 00:25:07,194
So,

298
00:25:10,336 --> 00:25:12,977
this zero bar is our entry point.

299
00:25:14,899 --> 00:25:15,559
So that makes

300
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,521
So this section entries from here.

301
00:25:28,342 --> 00:25:30,803
And we use this section transition,

302
00:25:31,283 --> 00:25:32,644
especially in boss battles,

303
00:25:34,004 --> 00:25:36,065
which has several sequences in battle,

304
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:40,267
but sequence is basically unidirectional.

305
00:25:41,788 --> 00:25:42,948
And most importantly,

306
00:25:43,589 --> 00:25:45,369
end the music in Sync with the Game.

307
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:50,171
So let's take a look at this boss battle music.

308
00:25:53,864 --> 00:25:57,748
OK, so this music contains three sections, main loop

309
00:25:57,788 --> 00:26:04,055
section, and pre-end section, and end section.

310
00:26:05,236 --> 00:26:09,240
So music will be transitioned from main loop to pre-end, and

311
00:26:09,561 --> 00:26:11,183
pre-end to end.

312
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:14,546
So let's take a look at this video.

313
00:26:27,929 --> 00:26:27,989
You

314
00:27:41,584 --> 00:27:42,564
Thank you, thank you.

315
00:27:44,925 --> 00:27:45,305
All right.

316
00:27:46,525 --> 00:27:48,666
So in this implementation,

317
00:27:49,366 --> 00:27:51,047
there was three challenges we have.

318
00:27:51,527 --> 00:27:54,388
And first thing is time signature changes.

319
00:27:57,328 --> 00:28:00,769
The music from last video was named Invidia,

320
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:03,650
what has a lot of time signature changes.

321
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:05,391
It's a mix of 3-4 and 4-4.

322
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:11,635
Actually, there are a lot of time signature variations, or

323
00:28:11,655 --> 00:28:13,977
it changes in JRPG music.

324
00:28:14,678 --> 00:28:16,819
So I designed Magi to support them.

325
00:28:18,621 --> 00:28:20,002
Let's see how to implement that.

326
00:28:23,344 --> 00:28:24,665
So it's really easy.

327
00:28:28,891 --> 00:28:29,891
Nope, looks like easy.

328
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:31,792
Easy for me.

329
00:28:32,492 --> 00:28:35,153
So just divide meter into two.

330
00:28:35,273 --> 00:28:37,794
So that makes the same time signature.

331
00:28:38,135 --> 00:28:43,977
And you can easily input your time signature you want.

332
00:28:44,657 --> 00:28:48,939
And actually, you can do any time signature.

333
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,580
3, 4, 7, 4, or 90, 60, or whatever you want.

334
00:28:58,054 --> 00:28:59,536
So, I mean, it's any.

335
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:04,381
So the result is like this.

336
00:29:04,401 --> 00:29:08,926
Okay, let's see this 3, 4, and 4, 4.

337
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,530
Oh, I actually have a quick feature.

338
00:29:39,051 --> 00:29:39,771
Okay, that's nice.

339
00:29:40,172 --> 00:29:44,154
And the other case, such as Omnis Lacrimar.

340
00:29:47,555 --> 00:29:47,896
This one.

341
00:29:48,616 --> 00:29:51,157
This music has a lot of tempo changes,

342
00:29:51,317 --> 00:29:54,899
I mean, little than those, but you can do that.

343
00:29:57,541 --> 00:29:59,281
Maybe big noise, big sound.

344
00:30:14,877 --> 00:30:15,457
Yeah, that's it.

345
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:17,580
So the procedure is same again.

346
00:30:18,921 --> 00:30:21,464
It's really easy for me.

347
00:30:23,346 --> 00:30:25,929
Just divide a meter and a divided region

348
00:30:26,229 --> 00:30:30,995
and input the tempo or just drag the boundary.

349
00:30:31,395 --> 00:30:35,160
So that makes, that calculates the tempo automatically.

350
00:30:41,783 --> 00:30:47,504
Eventually, this music had no interactive feature in the game, but I think this was

351
00:30:47,564 --> 00:30:49,585
a great example to demonstrate.

352
00:30:52,006 --> 00:30:55,706
Now I can use any music in this system.

353
00:30:56,527 --> 00:31:00,748
So the next thing is custom sync points.

354
00:31:02,568 --> 00:31:06,729
The sync points are the musical timing that transitions are allowed.

355
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:08,890
So let me show you some demo.

356
00:31:15,852 --> 00:31:17,114
So the sync point is...

357
00:31:17,134 --> 00:31:25,485
This red bar is one of the sync points.

358
00:31:25,746 --> 00:31:25,866
Or...

359
00:31:25,886 --> 00:31:30,953
This red bar.

360
00:31:31,694 --> 00:31:32,014
Or this.

361
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:44,403
So normally, like this music, each bar or each two bars or each four bars, the constant sync point

362
00:31:44,763 --> 00:31:53,408
will suffice as sync points. In that case, all you have to do is just select this sync type

363
00:31:54,168 --> 00:32:02,793
from this, from here. So this time I set our next two bar.

364
00:32:04,265 --> 00:32:07,807
or four bar, or next bar, or anything.

365
00:32:10,488 --> 00:32:12,249
However, in many of the music

366
00:32:12,469 --> 00:32:14,330
we use our horizontal re-sequences,

367
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:18,651
constant sync points will not be musical.

368
00:32:20,112 --> 00:32:23,594
So, like the music of last one.

369
00:32:27,255 --> 00:32:28,596
This music in video,

370
00:32:28,936 --> 00:32:31,777
basically has 80 bars constant sync points,

371
00:32:31,837 --> 00:32:33,478
but for example.

372
00:32:35,214 --> 00:32:40,904
say, like this region contains the time signature changes.

373
00:32:41,064 --> 00:32:47,355
So, actually this length is like 14 bars, I think.

374
00:33:03,545 --> 00:33:06,906
OK, so this region is not 8-bar, so it's not constant.

375
00:33:08,907 --> 00:33:12,268
So we had to customize these sync points for every music.

376
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:16,729
Now I will demonstrate setting up these custom sync points.

377
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:24,451
So first, you had to add custom points from here.

378
00:33:26,172 --> 00:33:32,413
But before that, if you said these are sync type to, say,

379
00:33:32,473 --> 00:33:36,495
next to bar or next bar, then you add the custom points.

380
00:33:37,775 --> 00:33:41,996
You already have the same sync points by default.

381
00:33:42,716 --> 00:33:48,238
So all you have to do is just move or delete

382
00:33:50,579 --> 00:33:53,239
that you think transitions are not musical.

383
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,000
Or.

384
00:33:55,024 --> 00:33:58,807
add the sync points that you think transitions is musical.

385
00:34:04,011 --> 00:34:05,553
And the result is like this.

386
00:34:10,377 --> 00:34:10,577
Here.

387
00:34:12,118 --> 00:34:14,200
So these are the sync points for this music

388
00:34:14,801 --> 00:34:18,344
and the system will wait for the next sync points

389
00:34:18,504 --> 00:34:19,125
to transition.

390
00:34:42,852 --> 00:34:46,353
But as you can see, this custom sync point has a

391
00:34:46,413 --> 00:34:48,795
disadvantage for synchronization.

392
00:34:51,696 --> 00:34:56,599
Sometimes sync points are hard to find, and you may have to

393
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,780
wait 16 bars or more to transition.

394
00:35:02,242 --> 00:35:08,185
So in that regard, we use pre-end section for every

395
00:35:08,225 --> 00:35:10,486
music that has an end section.

396
00:35:12,217 --> 00:35:16,342
Because, say, like the last song,

397
00:35:18,464 --> 00:35:21,507
he wants to end the music from this main loop section. ♪♪

398
00:35:26,212 --> 00:35:28,494
Yeah, I already triggered the transition,

399
00:35:28,534 --> 00:35:30,596
but you have to wait until here.

400
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,579
Come on!

401
00:35:41,557 --> 00:35:43,317
Maybe I already defeated the boss.

402
00:35:43,397 --> 00:35:47,418
So it's really awkward if music keeps playing

403
00:35:47,558 --> 00:35:50,919
or keeps transitioning after you defeated your boss.

404
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:57,240
So that's why we use the pre-end section.

405
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:03,302
And pre-end section is designed to have more dense

406
00:36:03,622 --> 00:36:04,822
and constant sync points.

407
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:05,702
So that makes.

408
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,261
It's really quick transition.

409
00:36:19,762 --> 00:36:23,463
All right, so transition from main loop to pre-end

410
00:36:23,883 --> 00:36:26,224
is music first, because we don't have to

411
00:36:26,944 --> 00:36:28,744
make severe synchronization.

412
00:36:29,384 --> 00:36:32,005
But, transition from pre-end to end

413
00:36:32,585 --> 00:36:36,526
is synchronization first, because we want to end the music

414
00:36:36,766 --> 00:36:39,447
in sync with the boss was defeated.

415
00:36:42,343 --> 00:36:45,785
So this main loop, pre-end, and end structure

416
00:36:45,905 --> 00:36:48,186
is same for all other boss battle music.

417
00:36:49,987 --> 00:36:51,667
Sorry.

418
00:36:53,328 --> 00:36:57,089
Okay, so let's take a look at Titans as an example.

419
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:02,552
Oh, here is our Apocalypse Noctis.

420
00:37:06,353 --> 00:37:09,935
So this also has a main loop, pre-end, end structure, and.

421
00:37:11,384 --> 00:37:18,307
is the custom point and you can see the main loop has not dense but a customized sync point

422
00:37:19,568 --> 00:37:24,851
and pre-end section has more dense and constant sync point so that makes

423
00:37:24,871 --> 00:37:38,237
yeah easy to synchronize

424
00:37:40,528 --> 00:37:43,510
So this main loop, pre-end, end structure,

425
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:47,012
I think is the key to make epic and interactive music.

426
00:37:49,974 --> 00:37:51,975
Okay, wrap up this section transition.

427
00:37:53,376 --> 00:37:55,657
Epic music that has strong melody line

428
00:37:56,538 --> 00:38:00,520
needs to, any tempo and time signature support.

429
00:38:01,961 --> 00:38:04,282
And needs custom sync points,

430
00:38:05,563 --> 00:38:09,485
but this makes the synchronization issue,

431
00:38:09,545 --> 00:38:09,705
so.

432
00:38:11,002 --> 00:38:13,564
We need pre-end section for each music.

433
00:38:17,466 --> 00:38:21,049
OK, so the last topic is synchronization.

434
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:24,231
But this time is more severe one.

435
00:38:24,252 --> 00:38:28,915
Because last video you see, versus Rocky, was quite easy.

436
00:38:29,926 --> 00:38:32,547
because it don't contain any cut scenes

437
00:38:32,867 --> 00:38:34,808
or special attacks kind of thing.

438
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:36,629
So it's quite simple.

439
00:38:37,009 --> 00:38:40,650
But boss battles with the astral gods,

440
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:45,092
like Titan and Leviathan and Eflit,

441
00:38:45,112 --> 00:38:47,113
requires more strict synchronization

442
00:38:48,313 --> 00:38:52,935
because each finish blow is scripted to each battle

443
00:38:53,535 --> 00:38:57,357
and music must synchronize to each special attack.

444
00:38:59,864 --> 00:39:01,185
So, ah, okay.

445
00:39:01,565 --> 00:39:04,666
By the way, the videos I will show you from now on

446
00:39:04,767 --> 00:39:07,008
are possibly spoilers, so be careful.

447
00:39:08,088 --> 00:39:11,530
And if you really don't want to see the spoiler,

448
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:12,630
just close your eye.

449
00:39:13,771 --> 00:39:14,952
Listen to the music, okay?

450
00:39:16,392 --> 00:39:19,094
So let's see the Leviathan's battle theme.

451
00:39:19,514 --> 00:39:19,734
Again.

452
00:39:22,227 --> 00:39:26,729
This music also has our main loop and pre-end and end section.

453
00:39:27,429 --> 00:39:32,750
And transition to pre-end section will trigger when the tornado happens.

454
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:38,052
And transition to end section will trigger during the ending scene.

455
00:39:38,992 --> 00:39:39,972
So, let's take a look.

456
00:42:08,979 --> 00:42:11,901
OK, let's talk about synchronization.

457
00:42:12,341 --> 00:42:15,103
The last thing, including the finish blow,

458
00:42:15,223 --> 00:42:17,245
is about 20 seconds long.

459
00:42:18,225 --> 00:42:22,748
So to make sure the ending music syncs to this finish

460
00:42:22,768 --> 00:42:27,591
blow, you have to care about the transition time and transition

461
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:28,452
time error.

462
00:42:29,433 --> 00:42:31,494
So let's see the transition time.

463
00:42:33,595 --> 00:42:38,018
So I want to test transition from pre-end to end section.

464
00:42:39,672 --> 00:42:40,352
Let's see.

465
00:42:53,955 --> 00:43:02,217
So this transition takes at least about three seconds, but it depends on the timing you trigger the transition.

466
00:43:02,297 --> 00:43:03,317
So it may be

467
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:18,311
It may take five or six seconds at max.

468
00:43:19,232 --> 00:43:22,714
So, taking account of this transition time,

469
00:43:24,955 --> 00:43:28,797
I said transition trigger six seconds

470
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:30,498
after the last thing started.

471
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:33,700
So, it looks good.

472
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,522
It has some errors, but will be fine.

473
00:43:37,462 --> 00:43:41,785
But then, we decided to make quick time event.

474
00:43:43,341 --> 00:43:48,315
Just before the final blow, you mean to enhance the player engagement?

475
00:43:49,864 --> 00:43:51,746
Oh, wait, who cares the music?

476
00:43:52,266 --> 00:43:55,349
So transition takes three to six seconds,

477
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:59,012
and we can't trigger the transition after this QTE.

478
00:43:59,072 --> 00:43:59,633
It's too late.

479
00:43:59,913 --> 00:44:05,117
So lucky I confirmed that this QTE takes three seconds

480
00:44:05,317 --> 00:44:10,882
at max, but maybe there's three seconds here

481
00:44:10,962 --> 00:44:12,123
and three seconds here,

482
00:44:12,183 --> 00:44:16,927
so maybe six seconds error at max.

483
00:44:18,667 --> 00:44:20,108
Maybe it's quite big.

484
00:44:21,229 --> 00:44:22,910
So I did the comparison.

485
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:26,012
The longest QTE completion and shortest.

486
00:44:26,953 --> 00:44:28,194
So let's see the longest one.

487
00:44:37,981 --> 00:44:38,501
I triggered.

488
00:44:40,583 --> 00:44:41,063
Wait for QTE.

489
00:44:51,246 --> 00:44:56,188
Okay, it works I think. And the shortest one.

490
00:44:56,948 --> 00:45:04,671
Trigger.

491
00:45:15,075 --> 00:45:15,875
Sounds good.

492
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:22,278
So, the two game scenes make actually different

493
00:45:22,758 --> 00:45:25,520
music synchronization, but I think both

494
00:45:26,101 --> 00:45:27,501
has an impacted ending.

495
00:45:29,123 --> 00:45:32,024
So still, there are edge cases such as

496
00:45:32,405 --> 00:45:34,906
music transition go really fast,

497
00:45:35,226 --> 00:45:37,508
and the player not pushing any button.

498
00:45:38,389 --> 00:45:41,350
Then synchronization could possibly not work, I think.

499
00:45:41,571 --> 00:45:41,871
Sorry.

500
00:45:42,231 --> 00:45:43,372
But, um,

501
00:45:44,933 --> 00:45:47,614
in most cases, player will push the button.

502
00:45:48,275 --> 00:45:48,595
I believe.

503
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:58,222
You know, so in about a second, so we actually did nothing related to this QTE to help music

504
00:45:58,282 --> 00:46:05,704
transition. The transition is already triggered before the QTE, and after that, believe the player.

505
00:46:08,645 --> 00:46:17,987
So, lastly, I will show you the Ifrit battle music, titled Hellfire, which I'm really

506
00:46:18,147 --> 00:46:19,328
emotionally involved with.

507
00:46:21,139 --> 00:46:34,303
To be honest, there are no technical issues about this music because the composer Suzuki-san and I worked very close and we already had the know-how to synchronize music to these boss battles.

508
00:46:35,344 --> 00:46:50,028
And I sent him our gameplay video of this boss battle and he wrote our music that has really heroic progression and is easy to transition in power.

509
00:46:53,799 --> 00:46:56,161
Okay, so this is Hellfire.

510
00:46:58,905 --> 00:47:01,588
And first transition from main loop to pre-end

511
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,431
happens when you damage ifrit enough

512
00:47:04,792 --> 00:47:07,215
and ifrit gets kind of serious mode

513
00:47:07,856 --> 00:47:09,037
and background darkens.

514
00:47:37,059 --> 00:47:45,845
And last transition from pre-end to end aims to synchronize the one minute long ending scene of this battle.

515
00:48:03,931 --> 00:48:07,073
So just one thing I have to care about

516
00:48:07,213 --> 00:48:11,356
is this long intro of this pre-end section

517
00:48:11,396 --> 00:48:14,638
because the transition from this loop region

518
00:48:14,978 --> 00:48:17,399
was quite works well, as you hear,

519
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:20,021
but transition from this loop region.

520
00:48:29,575 --> 00:48:30,295
Maybe it's not.

521
00:48:31,315 --> 00:48:34,356
I put these transition sync points

522
00:48:34,836 --> 00:48:37,917
just in case if it's really quick.

523
00:48:38,617 --> 00:48:42,718
But actually, I tested this bottle

524
00:48:43,178 --> 00:48:44,379
without any debug cheats.

525
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:45,739
I'm just playing.

526
00:48:46,399 --> 00:48:48,500
And I confirmed that the bottle

527
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,121
after the transition of pre-end

528
00:48:51,601 --> 00:48:52,921
lasts more than one minute.

529
00:48:53,041 --> 00:48:56,382
So it may be transition from this loop region.

530
00:49:00,361 --> 00:49:07,703
OK, so let's take a look at the epic and interactive music

531
00:49:08,223 --> 00:49:08,823
in if we parted.

532
00:49:08,923 --> 00:49:09,303
Oh, sorry.

533
00:49:09,583 --> 00:49:13,144
Before that, we checked the synchronization overview.

534
00:49:13,604 --> 00:49:17,125
And the gameplay after the pre-end section start,

535
00:49:17,786 --> 00:49:19,546
we lost more than one minute.

536
00:49:20,986 --> 00:49:23,327
And after that, ending scene starts.

537
00:49:23,567 --> 00:49:28,048
And I triggered the transition to end section at the same

538
00:49:28,088 --> 00:49:28,268
time.

539
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:37,460
and ending music in sync to the finished blog. Again, there is two to three seconds error

540
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:45,948
at the transition time, but ending the music right where it needs to. So, please watch

541
00:49:46,229 --> 00:49:52,715
the epic and interactive music in the Eflite bottle. Sorry, this is maybe a huge spoiler.

542
00:49:54,596 --> 00:49:59,558
And this is my gameplay video, and actually all video was played by me.

543
00:49:59,978 --> 00:50:03,799
And I played this game maybe more than 100 hours.

544
00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:06,740
And so I beat Ifrit so fast, actually.

545
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:11,402
But in most cases, things were not the same as this.

546
00:50:12,182 --> 00:50:13,002
So please take a look.

547
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:47,785
Hey, what's up? Hey, what's up?

548
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:14,049
You

549
00:53:32,865 --> 00:53:33,485
Oh, thank you.

550
00:53:33,505 --> 00:53:35,225
It was fantastic.

551
00:53:38,947 --> 00:53:39,287
All right.

552
00:53:39,607 --> 00:53:41,567
So wrap up the synchronization.

553
00:53:42,348 --> 00:53:46,569
So if you want to make or implement music for games

554
00:53:46,609 --> 00:53:50,650
like Final Fantasy, I mean games that need strong melody line

555
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:52,931
and, at the same time, interactivity.

556
00:53:54,179 --> 00:54:00,685
Be considerate of durations, such as duration of transition and its error,

557
00:54:01,066 --> 00:54:06,311
and duration of loop region, and duration of cutscene, duration of gameplay.

558
00:54:06,511 --> 00:54:09,634
It depends on the player, but you can predict and you can believe.

559
00:54:10,374 --> 00:54:13,437
And duration of player's emotional change.

560
00:54:14,458 --> 00:54:17,901
It's not just a single moment, but I think it's the range of time.

561
00:54:20,779 --> 00:54:22,620
And move to conclusions.

562
00:54:24,141 --> 00:54:26,462
Maybe I just say again, so,

563
00:54:27,483 --> 00:54:29,804
epic music that has strong melody line

564
00:54:30,245 --> 00:54:32,506
needs any tempo or time signature support

565
00:54:32,766 --> 00:54:34,087
and needs custom sync points,

566
00:54:34,527 --> 00:54:37,549
but this makes synchronization harder,

567
00:54:37,589 --> 00:54:39,670
so we use pre-end section to synchronize

568
00:54:40,671 --> 00:54:43,873
and be considerate of duration of transition gameplay,

569
00:54:44,253 --> 00:54:45,173
emotion, et cetera.

570
00:54:47,982 --> 00:54:51,504
And for the future, depend, sorry,

571
00:54:53,485 --> 00:54:55,446
I want to make some new features.

572
00:54:56,747 --> 00:54:58,708
First is custom transition destination.

573
00:54:59,328 --> 00:55:02,210
This time we had a custom transition start point,

574
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:06,352
but the destination is fixed to the entry point,

575
00:55:06,392 --> 00:55:09,434
but I think sometimes we need to change

576
00:55:09,474 --> 00:55:11,595
that depends on the situation.

577
00:55:13,716 --> 00:55:16,238
And interactive versus short loop program.

578
00:55:17,258 --> 00:55:23,681
Actually, I tried to divide some songs into the sections to make it interactive, but the

579
00:55:23,701 --> 00:55:29,765
dividing music leads to short loops and maybe it's annoying.

580
00:55:31,326 --> 00:55:35,668
So to avoid that, you have to make longer songs.

581
00:55:37,169 --> 00:55:40,531
And finally, more interactive music features in the future.

582
00:55:43,012 --> 00:55:46,834
Okay, so thank you for that, and I have to say,

583
00:55:46,854 --> 00:55:47,874
ah, sorry.

584
00:55:49,475 --> 00:55:52,337
Thank you for coming today, and welcome your questions.

585
00:55:52,817 --> 00:55:55,098
And if you have questions,

586
00:55:55,478 --> 00:55:58,479
please are cued to that sound camera.

587
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:03,882
And, okay, please speak slowly and clearly.

588
00:56:04,342 --> 00:56:06,323
Maybe my listening skill is not good.

589
00:56:06,523 --> 00:56:10,405
And before that, I want to thank you,

590
00:56:10,425 --> 00:56:12,366
thank to these people.

591
00:56:13,556 --> 00:56:15,137
from the main composer Shimomura-san,

592
00:56:16,118 --> 00:56:18,540
and Shibata-san and Aoki-san as composer,

593
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,303
and Suzuki-san and Nakama-san as additional composer.

594
00:56:22,503 --> 00:56:22,924
Are you there?

595
00:56:25,065 --> 00:56:25,706
No? Really? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

596
00:56:41,762 --> 00:56:46,045
And Aota-san as arranger, and Kaomori-san as music supervisor, and Osanai-san as music

597
00:56:46,105 --> 00:56:46,466
drummer.

598
00:56:46,546 --> 00:56:48,067
So, welcome to your question.

599
00:56:49,628 --> 00:56:49,948
Thank you.

600
00:56:56,614 --> 00:56:57,334
Thank you.

601
00:56:57,354 --> 00:56:58,355
Thank you very much for the talk.

602
00:56:58,776 --> 00:57:01,618
I guess I have a question about how much...

603
00:57:02,854 --> 00:57:06,677
of the music was planned in advance to do this,

604
00:57:07,217 --> 00:57:09,618
and how much was figured out later?

605
00:57:10,679 --> 00:57:11,159
How much?

606
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:15,702
Actually, you know, I entered Square Enix

607
00:57:15,822 --> 00:57:19,204
in just two years ago, and it was already composed,

608
00:57:20,045 --> 00:57:24,368
and many of these are not planned to be interactive.

609
00:57:24,468 --> 00:57:26,289
So actually, I made

610
00:57:28,441 --> 00:57:29,941
the music for the trailer.

611
00:57:30,621 --> 00:57:36,423
And I made that music for the trailer divide into sections

612
00:57:36,923 --> 00:57:38,723
and make the end section.

613
00:57:38,803 --> 00:57:44,285
So the last one, Hellfire, is actually planned for the

614
00:57:44,325 --> 00:57:46,665
interactive feature.

615
00:57:46,725 --> 00:57:48,726
So I think it was good.

616
00:57:50,766 --> 00:57:51,086
OK?

617
00:57:51,226 --> 00:57:51,506
Thank you.

618
00:57:51,526 --> 00:57:54,587
Hi, thank you so much.

619
00:57:54,847 --> 00:57:55,107
Thank you.

620
00:57:55,555 --> 00:58:02,558
How much of the features that you showed us in the Magi,

621
00:58:03,298 --> 00:58:06,319
is possible in FMOD or Wwise?

622
00:58:09,241 --> 00:58:10,541
That's a great question, I think.

623
00:58:10,841 --> 00:58:14,163
All these, hi, I'm Atsushi from Square Enix.

624
00:58:14,223 --> 00:58:14,363
Hi.

625
00:58:16,943 --> 00:58:19,444
Well, all these two is in-house basically.

626
00:58:19,784 --> 00:58:23,106
So you can't do all this Wwise stuff

627
00:58:23,486 --> 00:58:26,367
because there's no connection between them.

628
00:58:27,088 --> 00:58:30,209
So you couldn't really do anything like that in Wwise,

629
00:58:30,269 --> 00:58:30,930
is what you're saying?

630
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:32,090
Oh, OK.

631
00:58:32,791 --> 00:58:37,053
I don't really know what the features are on Wwise.

632
00:58:38,413 --> 00:58:39,394
Maybe you might be able to.

633
00:58:39,414 --> 00:58:40,414
You might be able to.

634
00:58:40,434 --> 00:58:40,494
OK.

635
00:58:40,554 --> 00:58:43,176
You might be able to, though.

636
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:52,703
Of course you can do batch code and follow it into Wwise, but I think Wwise don't have...

637
00:58:54,924 --> 00:58:58,166
I don't blame them, but they don't have...

638
00:58:59,784 --> 00:59:03,905
such as time signature change or tempo change support.

639
00:59:04,505 --> 00:59:09,566
So if you want to use that kind of music, it's hard.

640
00:59:10,106 --> 00:59:12,967
Maybe you can because they has a custom cue feature,

641
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:15,807
so you can manually put the custom cues

642
00:59:15,948 --> 00:59:18,048
for each wave file.

643
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:20,088
You can do that, but it's troublesome.

644
00:59:20,108 --> 00:59:21,909
For each bar, yeah.

645
00:59:21,929 --> 00:59:22,629
Okay, thank you so much.

646
00:59:22,909 --> 00:59:23,169
Thank you.

647
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:28,499
Hi, thanks for the talk.

648
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:29,580
I have a question.

649
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:34,002
I haven't played all the way through the FF515,

650
00:59:34,042 --> 00:59:37,043
but was there any music non-diegetic?

651
00:59:38,524 --> 00:59:39,525
Like diegetic music?

652
00:59:40,425 --> 00:59:41,666
source music, like underscore,

653
00:59:41,726 --> 00:59:44,448
I think most Final Fantasy have underscore type music,

654
00:59:44,508 --> 00:59:47,371
but there was really beautiful bossa nova music

655
00:59:47,411 --> 00:59:49,212
in a restaurant, you know, layers,

656
00:59:49,292 --> 00:59:51,314
but was there any source music,

657
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:53,055
like music coming from radio,

658
00:59:53,555 --> 00:59:55,357
and if so, how did you manage

659
00:59:55,377 --> 00:59:57,358
with the regular underscore music,

660
00:59:57,418 --> 00:59:59,680
and how did you interact?

661
01:00:01,083 --> 01:00:04,686
Actually we had kind of non-diet music in rest town.

662
01:00:05,006 --> 01:00:06,967
That is one of the outposts.

663
01:00:07,567 --> 01:00:11,169
And there was kind of street musicians.

664
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:16,713
And all we do is just ducking the other music.

665
01:00:16,913 --> 01:00:19,074
It's a crossway between them.

666
01:00:19,274 --> 01:00:20,095
Okay.

667
01:00:20,415 --> 01:00:21,936
It is interactive.

668
01:00:22,096 --> 01:00:22,996
Okay, wow.

669
01:00:23,136 --> 01:00:23,777
Simple stuff.

670
01:00:24,157 --> 01:00:24,617
Okay, thanks.

671
01:00:25,258 --> 01:00:25,518
Thank you.

672
01:00:29,071 --> 01:00:33,872
This is kind of a new question, is it possible to buy Maggi tool?

673
01:00:39,193 --> 01:00:42,473
Yeah, it's a great question actually. We'll think about that.

674
01:00:43,613 --> 01:00:44,154
Maybe not.

675
01:00:44,194 --> 01:00:45,194
It depends on the money.

676
01:00:45,234 --> 01:00:47,554
You know?

677
01:00:49,034 --> 01:00:50,735
Okay. Thank you.

678
01:00:51,055 --> 01:00:53,795
Thank you. But currently not, sorry.

679
01:00:55,596 --> 01:00:57,916
Okay. That's maybe the last one.

680
01:01:00,391 --> 01:01:00,691
Thank you.

681
01:01:00,711 --> 01:01:01,571
Thank you.

682
01:01:02,772 --> 01:01:10,415
Did you look into or plan to look into adding custom bars for transitions?

683
01:01:10,455 --> 01:01:16,397
Like, for example, the restaurant music, when you switch between the two, you have the sync

684
01:01:16,497 --> 01:01:20,758
points to go to the kind of heavier version with the drums.

685
01:01:22,098 --> 01:01:28,709
But are you looking into stuff like being able to specify like a drum roll to get the

686
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:31,193
drums into the music as opposed to just...

687
01:01:32,297 --> 01:01:35,658
starting to play them at the right point.

688
01:01:36,579 --> 01:01:40,000
So just like a custom one bar drum roll

689
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,801
that you would play at the time of the sync.

690
01:01:42,941 --> 01:01:45,281
So I don't know if you looked into

691
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:47,422
or if it's too much work on the composers.

692
01:01:47,462 --> 01:01:48,902
Actually, thank you.

693
01:01:48,982 --> 01:01:49,203
Yeah.

694
01:01:50,223 --> 01:01:51,943
And the question is, I think.

695
01:01:53,824 --> 01:01:58,468
can we put the transitional stinger

696
01:02:00,030 --> 01:02:04,555
when the transition mode A to B, and I can.

697
01:02:05,235 --> 01:02:08,278
But maybe we couldn't use this

698
01:02:08,459 --> 01:02:13,343
because we don't have plan to do that,

699
01:02:13,424 --> 01:02:16,627
but I had a function for that.

700
01:02:19,038 --> 01:02:20,139
I call it instrument.

701
01:02:20,919 --> 01:02:21,799
Sorry, where is it?

702
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:23,761
Okay, see, Garden Quay,

703
01:02:24,261 --> 01:02:26,262
and this has our transition here,

704
01:02:27,082 --> 01:02:27,243
and

705
01:02:31,345 --> 01:02:32,526
these are instrument,

706
01:02:32,906 --> 01:02:36,368
and if you add some, say, symbol switch

707
01:02:36,508 --> 01:02:38,009
or something into the instrument,

708
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:39,990
you can select the instrument from here

709
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:44,152
and play it with the transition.

710
01:02:44,492 --> 01:02:44,793
You can.

711
01:02:45,473 --> 01:02:46,654
But we didn't.

712
01:02:47,695 --> 01:02:49,276
Oh, sorry.

713
01:02:49,896 --> 01:02:53,077
Is it mostly because the music was already written

714
01:02:53,438 --> 01:02:57,239
or is it because it's too much work to use that feature?

715
01:02:57,419 --> 01:03:00,961
Or is it because it doesn't make too much difference?

716
01:03:00,981 --> 01:03:05,523
Maybe I think in just this setting I feel good,

717
01:03:05,583 --> 01:03:06,344
so it's okay.

718
01:03:06,764 --> 01:03:07,024
Okay.

719
01:03:07,804 --> 01:03:09,725
The two can do it, two can do it, definitely.

720
01:03:10,066 --> 01:03:10,306
Thanks.

721
01:03:10,786 --> 01:03:11,146
Thank you.

722
01:03:11,366 --> 01:03:13,087
Thank you very much for coming.
