1
00:00:05,712 --> 00:00:09,695
All right, so you're in Music of Battletech, Big Sound on a Budget.

2
00:00:10,075 --> 00:00:11,496
Let's go over the agenda real quick.

3
00:00:12,097 --> 00:00:15,940
I'm basically going to start with the anatomy of the Battletech score.

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,944
I'm going to move on into how I built the team and how I hired the orchestras.

5
00:00:23,145 --> 00:00:25,367
And that'll move us into budget and planning,

6
00:00:25,647 --> 00:00:30,210
and then ways that we increased mileage using these recordings that we had.

7
00:00:32,172 --> 00:00:35,134
But first, you might be asking, who am I?

8
00:00:36,252 --> 00:00:39,615
It's kind of existential, but my name is John Everest.

9
00:00:39,675 --> 00:00:43,838
I'm a freelance composer from Seattle, mostly work in video games.

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,323
And I've scored several games, most notably Dragonfall, Shadowrun,

11
00:00:49,343 --> 00:00:54,087
Dragonfall, Shadowrun Hong Kong, Necropolis.

12
00:00:55,613 --> 00:00:58,315
and most recently Battletech, the one we're talking about today.

13
00:00:58,335 --> 00:01:05,058
And I'm currently doing the music for V1 Interactive, which will probably be announcing some stuff

14
00:01:05,078 --> 00:01:08,979
in the next few months and then some other unannounced goodness as well.

15
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,161
But today, as I said, we're going to mostly focus on Battletech.

16
00:01:14,602 --> 00:01:19,304
And I'm going to dig as deep as I can in 30 minutes on how I recorded the score.

17
00:01:20,768 --> 00:01:26,151
try to help you with your next gig if you are getting a larger budget to work with larger

18
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:26,751
ensembles.

19
00:01:28,032 --> 00:01:32,034
But first, have any of you played Battletech or know what Battletech is?

20
00:01:32,054 --> 00:01:33,715
All right.

21
00:01:35,956 --> 00:01:39,058
So I'm going to play a little bit of the opening cinematic.

22
00:01:39,238 --> 00:01:42,300
Mike McCain, the art director in the crowd, is going to get mad at me because I used old

23
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:42,620
art.

24
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,782
But this will give you an idea of what Battletech is.

25
00:01:53,023 --> 00:01:54,564
Thank you for watching.

26
00:03:32,808 --> 00:03:34,169
So that's BattleTech.

27
00:03:34,749 --> 00:03:36,910
You get the gist, it's kind of Game of Thrones in space,

28
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,452
little medieval with a lot of sci-fi elements,

29
00:03:39,772 --> 00:03:42,693
basically giant robots punching each other

30
00:03:42,713 --> 00:03:43,914
in the face in space.

31
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:48,516
So let's dig into the anatomy of the soundtrack.

32
00:03:48,556 --> 00:03:51,478
First, it was 240 minutes of music.

33
00:03:51,738 --> 00:03:52,939
It's about four hours of music.

34
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:56,061
60 minutes of that was recorded with live ensembles.

35
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:58,642
So we had a pretty decent ratio

36
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:01,403
of what was kind of a largely orchestral score.

37
00:04:04,738 --> 00:04:12,485
We chose to record most of the score in Europe, spanning from Germany, Hungary, and all the way to Latvia,

38
00:04:13,445 --> 00:04:18,170
and of course back to Seattle, where we did some recordings ourselves.

39
00:04:20,082 --> 00:04:23,124
So first, in Germany, that you saw in that opening,

40
00:04:23,404 --> 00:04:25,526
we recorded with a 74-piece orchestra

41
00:04:25,626 --> 00:04:28,568
in the CPE Bach Chapel in Frankfurt.

42
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,111
We recorded the full ensemble in a chapel

43
00:04:33,632 --> 00:04:35,493
to give it kind of the lush, romantic sound

44
00:04:35,513 --> 00:04:37,655
we were going for for things like our main theme,

45
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,576
where all the players in the room together

46
00:04:39,596 --> 00:04:41,758
kind of have this magic happen

47
00:04:41,778 --> 00:04:44,200
where you can kind of be one unit.

48
00:04:45,521 --> 00:04:46,562
This was a two-hour session.

49
00:04:46,622 --> 00:04:48,323
We did it in a shared session format.

50
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,092
For those of you that aren't familiar, that's where you can actually split up the day with

51
00:04:53,132 --> 00:04:57,013
an orchestra with other composers and save a lot of money doing that.

52
00:04:57,053 --> 00:04:59,715
So it's definitely a way to push your budget further.

53
00:05:00,255 --> 00:05:03,576
So we've got about 20 minutes of total music from that two-hour session.

54
00:05:05,397 --> 00:05:09,258
So here's a dry clip from that session so you can get an idea of what it sounds like

55
00:05:09,298 --> 00:05:13,760
with all the added drums and whatnot that I had on that opening cinematic.

56
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:38,519
So, they sound great.

57
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:42,420
Nice cohesive sound in that great chapel.

58
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:50,500
Then the rest or the majority of the rest of the score was done in Budapest with a 66-piece

59
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,767
orchestra for about a four-hour session for that full kind of altogether 2D session.

60
00:05:56,625 --> 00:06:00,827
And then we also had a two-hour session beyond that with just 41 strings.

61
00:06:01,888 --> 00:06:06,850
We recorded the strings only primarily to use later on for things like interactive stems,

62
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:13,153
but also to overdub existing material we had to create a larger sound with the string sections.

63
00:06:14,453 --> 00:06:19,415
We did things like have string players put on their mutes in the second session, split

64
00:06:19,455 --> 00:06:22,077
between them to just add a little bit of a different sound.

65
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:27,960
We also did a solo cello there in Budapest.

66
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,001
And so these sessions brought us

67
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:31,481
about 40 minutes of additional music.

68
00:06:33,462 --> 00:06:36,983
And, oh, should have gone to that earlier, sorry.

69
00:06:38,183 --> 00:06:40,784
Here's a little bit of that session.

70
00:06:40,804 --> 00:06:42,945
This is just the strings in Budapest.

71
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:54,988
If you are seeing this comments in the chat box say Hi or LeafyGurl

72
00:06:55,088 --> 00:06:56,989
it will become very useful for you together.

73
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:06,776
Check out my other videos to see how I used the code.

74
00:07:06,956 --> 00:07:08,978
had a chat while reviewing this I meet Hurgie

75
00:07:09,018 --> 00:07:10,559
he was on theσηuller last week

76
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:11,880
Tell him I love him

77
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,261
Has Hurgie been in the game since March?

78
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:28,121

79
00:07:52,897 --> 00:07:56,621
This transcript was provided by Transcription Outsourcing, LLC.

80
00:08:09,358 --> 00:08:10,999
Laying it on pretty thick there.

81
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:18,501
Then they recorded in Latvia with a 24-piece choir, members of the Latvian radio choir,

82
00:08:19,002 --> 00:08:26,705
and we primarily used those to overlay existing tracks, add a little bit of variation to already choral arrangements.

83
00:08:27,645 --> 00:08:32,167
Here's a quick example of how I used them in a combat cue,

84
00:08:32,307 --> 00:08:37,829
and I literally just asked them to grunt over the track, so I'm sure they were happy about that.

85
00:08:49,624 --> 00:08:53,606
And then we also, in Seattle, recorded with a very talented vocalist, Emily Ridgway.

86
00:08:53,887 --> 00:08:56,428
She did overlays and also solo voice work for us.

87
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:00,650
And then of course I did some of my own recordings myself.

88
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:06,313
Battletech is kind of, the whole aesthetic of Battletech is, it's far in the future but

89
00:09:06,393 --> 00:09:10,795
we have this aging technology, they're using equipment that's just laying around, repurposing

90
00:09:10,835 --> 00:09:11,435
it in different ways.

91
00:09:11,496 --> 00:09:16,398
So I tried to create, you know, stuff that I just had laying around, create something

92
00:09:16,418 --> 00:09:17,639
I called the Fragrance Ring, which...

93
00:09:19,346 --> 00:09:24,428
I just bowed, I plucked, I hit with things, and made some interesting noises to add a

94
00:09:24,448 --> 00:09:27,729
little bit of that gritty texture to the score.

95
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:33,531
And here's a quick, I'll just show a quick video of a track that is primarily the Frankenstring,

96
00:09:33,551 --> 00:09:38,173
there's some piano and guitar over it, but the rest of it is actually just this weird

97
00:09:38,213 --> 00:09:38,413
box.

98
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,260
You get the idea.

99
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:12,144
Yeah, that's me in my sweatpants hitting garbage, turning it into a percussion instrument, pretty

100
00:10:12,164 --> 00:10:13,104
much whatever I could find.

101
00:10:14,945 --> 00:10:20,268
And then of course this was all edited and implemented by me using Wwise, which was the

102
00:10:20,308 --> 00:10:21,649
choice of middleware for us.

103
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,792
So that's the gist of the anatomy of the Battletech score.

104
00:10:27,632 --> 00:10:29,413
So let's dig a little bit deeper.

105
00:10:30,444 --> 00:10:32,805
overview of how to pull this sort of thing off.

106
00:10:32,845 --> 00:10:36,987
This is kind of the first big orchestral score for me, so there's a lot of learning on my

107
00:10:37,047 --> 00:10:37,187
end.

108
00:10:38,528 --> 00:10:43,391
The goal, of course, is to avoid this feeling, showing up and kind of being a little bit

109
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:46,273
unprepared.

110
00:10:47,733 --> 00:10:51,376
It's always thrilling to record with orchestra, but it's always scary, I think.

111
00:10:51,516 --> 00:10:53,597
You know, it's a lot of things coming together at once.

112
00:10:54,778 --> 00:11:01,401
The perception is something like this photo where composers are kind of this monolithic

113
00:11:02,222 --> 00:11:08,586
artist who's doing every little part of every piece along the way. That's really not the case.

114
00:11:08,606 --> 00:11:14,269
I mean this was literally the last take of a session that I had for a demo I was recording

115
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:20,092
and they forced me up on stage to conduct because I'm not a conductor myself.

116
00:11:21,205 --> 00:11:26,628
There's professionals that I rely on to do those sorts of things for me since I feel

117
00:11:26,648 --> 00:11:29,630
like I'm better served back in the engineering room.

118
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:35,274
So it looks like I'm calm and collected, but I'm terrified.

119
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:38,316
I am terrified.

120
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:42,899
And it's most likely that I have soiled my pants at this point.

121
00:11:45,965 --> 00:11:52,267
So that concept that the composer's out here doing everything, it's possible to wear multiple hats,

122
00:11:52,347 --> 00:11:59,049
but I think that the reality is more something like this, where that's my head in the middle there.

123
00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:05,951
The professional Peter Petschik is conducting over there. You saw him in the

124
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,471
string cue that I played before.

125
00:12:10,762 --> 00:12:14,984
And I'm basically surrounded by a team of professionals that are helping me bring my

126
00:12:15,064 --> 00:12:17,105
ideas to life, really.

127
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:23,828
So what I'm trying to say is it takes a team.

128
00:12:25,349 --> 00:12:27,290
Not the A team, but a team.

129
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:32,913
It might kind of feel like delegating is giving up some of your artistic soul.

130
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:36,732
But I think the reality is that's not the case.

131
00:12:37,512 --> 00:12:40,013
I think for Battletech, I really felt like if I gave up

132
00:12:41,314 --> 00:12:43,715
parts of it to other people, it would feel less mine.

133
00:12:43,895 --> 00:12:46,296
But I think the biggest lesson I learned from that is that

134
00:12:47,477 --> 00:12:50,198
collaboration to bring these ideas to life is

135
00:12:50,258 --> 00:12:50,979
always a good thing.

136
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:54,560
So I probably should have hired additional composers to

137
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,921
help me for such a massive scale for one person.

138
00:12:56,981 --> 00:12:59,603
But I chose to suffer for some reason.

139
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:06,732
So it takes a team. What do I mean by that?

140
00:13:07,793 --> 00:13:13,756
For those that don't know, or have never done this before, like I was in your place several years ago,

141
00:13:15,757 --> 00:13:17,518
a team is made up of a bunch of people.

142
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,700
Who's on your team? These numbers are by no means gospel.

143
00:13:22,441 --> 00:13:26,543
Take them with a huge grain of salt. They can be much cheaper, much more expensive.

144
00:13:26,923 --> 00:13:31,507
It depends on so many different things, but the team needs to be paid for their work,

145
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:32,067
hopefully.

146
00:13:33,168 --> 00:13:37,151
You know, anyone from an orchestrator, score part and prep, printing, which is way more

147
00:13:37,171 --> 00:13:42,776
expensive than you think it is, librarian, conductor, engineer, music editing, mixing,

148
00:13:43,617 --> 00:13:49,041
pro tools operator, implementation support, MIDI mockup support, remote soloists, obviously,

149
00:13:49,341 --> 00:13:50,322
additional composers.

150
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:53,724
It's a lot, but it's necessary.

151
00:13:56,005 --> 00:14:00,510
Good thing for you, though, is if building a team sounds daunting, there's actually producing

152
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:03,572
and contracting companies out there that can help build a team for you.

153
00:14:05,234 --> 00:14:07,456
And so, you know, team within a team.

154
00:14:07,536 --> 00:14:09,037
It's kind of like team inception.

155
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,283
Companies like Nashville Music Scoring down in Nashville, obviously.

156
00:14:15,784 --> 00:14:22,029
DynaMedian, who I worked with in Battletech, work a lot in Eastern Europe and are really

157
00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:22,310
great.

158
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,710
You can see that it's a little bit more complicated than that.

159
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,571
But, it's a great way to help you book your sessions and manage the whole thing.

160
00:14:25,611 --> 00:14:27,433
They even offer orchestration if you need it.

161
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:32,555
Seattle Music, Bastyr, David Sabia over there, does amazing work.

162
00:14:32,595 --> 00:14:33,836
Works on a lot of great scores.

163
00:14:34,116 --> 00:14:39,059
And then, Hollywood Scoring does a lot of very, very cool contracting work down in LA.

164
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,200
And there's many also.

165
00:14:46,566 --> 00:14:49,267
got your orchestra figured out, now you got to budget and plan.

166
00:14:49,887 --> 00:14:56,230
I have kind of three basic overview tips for budgeting and planning your orchestra session.

167
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,291
The one is just to do it early.

168
00:14:58,511 --> 00:15:03,493
So when you get, when you sign a contract or you're in the process of signing a contract

169
00:15:03,573 --> 00:15:07,895
with a studio, try to build in some R&D time into your, into your agreement.

170
00:15:08,935 --> 00:15:13,857
You know, say you want to really approach the score in the appropriate way and it takes

171
00:15:13,897 --> 00:15:14,357
time to do that.

172
00:15:14,377 --> 00:15:15,698
So you want to research the proper.

173
00:15:17,454 --> 00:15:19,915
You've got to build your templates, start building your templates.

174
00:15:19,955 --> 00:15:23,856
You've got to gather your bids from several different people, interview subcontractors,

175
00:15:23,896 --> 00:15:26,817
decide what composers you want to work with if you're having additional music.

176
00:15:28,017 --> 00:15:30,878
You know I'd love to have one month of R&D time.

177
00:15:31,338 --> 00:15:35,300
Sometimes you won't, I mean most times you probably won't get that but ask for it because

178
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,040
you'd be surprised.

179
00:15:37,984 --> 00:15:42,265
On top of that, make sure you're setting aside enough funds for yourself and your team.

180
00:15:43,106 --> 00:15:48,708
I know we're composers, we love to suffer, but you have to be very realistic about your

181
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:49,568
project duration.

182
00:15:50,508 --> 00:15:56,310
So fees associated with recording, fees associated with running your business, taxes, healthcare,

183
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:03,232
savings, all the sample libraries you want to buy, you know, it's important.

184
00:16:03,792 --> 00:16:05,053
You're in this for the long haul, right?

185
00:16:08,493 --> 00:16:11,194
So building a buffer, once you feel like you've comfortably

186
00:16:11,354 --> 00:16:13,215
established what it's gonna cost to do this,

187
00:16:13,635 --> 00:16:15,156
building in a buffer just helps you plan

188
00:16:15,176 --> 00:16:16,797
for those unforeseen circumstances.

189
00:16:17,737 --> 00:16:19,938
An example of that is the Lafayette Choir

190
00:16:19,998 --> 00:16:20,739
that we worked with.

191
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:22,560
It was a really important cue,

192
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,641
it was one of the last ones in the game

193
00:16:26,201 --> 00:16:27,482
and I really wanted to nail it,

194
00:16:27,562 --> 00:16:29,283
we just weren't getting it the way I wanted

195
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,084
so I had to add another hour to the session

196
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:31,344
and that.

197
00:16:31,738 --> 00:16:34,159
you know, that extra four grand comes out of me, right?

198
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:37,620
So it's important to kind of build that in.

199
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,420
You can obviously set up a scenario

200
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,661
where the studio themselves are paying

201
00:16:42,621 --> 00:16:44,462
the contractors directly.

202
00:16:45,482 --> 00:16:48,322
That can be preferred depending on how you like to operate,

203
00:16:48,362 --> 00:16:50,083
but it also can slow things down too.

204
00:16:53,064 --> 00:16:56,544
So just kind of a quick order of like basic

205
00:16:57,981 --> 00:17:01,223
understanding of how expensive it is to record by ranking.

206
00:17:01,883 --> 00:17:03,665
L.A. is typically the most expensive.

207
00:17:04,865 --> 00:17:08,267
London shortly after that, places like Abbey Road or Ayr.

208
00:17:08,988 --> 00:17:11,790
Nashville is very competitive and top-notch players.

209
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:17,233
There's actually a discount going on right now where if you have a session that's above

210
00:17:17,413 --> 00:17:22,236
$50,000, you get a 25% discount from the Nashville Department of Commerce.

211
00:17:23,177 --> 00:17:24,478
So that makes them very competitive.

212
00:17:25,834 --> 00:17:29,454
and then Budapest, which is where we chose to record,

213
00:17:29,914 --> 00:17:34,055
and then also Prague is on there too somewhere around,

214
00:17:34,075 --> 00:17:36,576
and these are all mixed around too.

215
00:17:36,876 --> 00:17:40,476
Depends on your ensemble, on your engineer, on everything.

216
00:17:40,676 --> 00:17:42,437
So keep that in mind.

217
00:17:47,018 --> 00:17:48,338
Once you've got all that figured out

218
00:17:48,938 --> 00:17:51,078
and you're kind of pushing the edge of that budget.

219
00:17:51,608 --> 00:17:53,789
There's a bunch of ways to increase mileage

220
00:17:54,749 --> 00:17:56,930
after you've got these recording sessions.

221
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,691
So, you know, you're always gonna be relying

222
00:18:01,031 --> 00:18:03,152
on your mock-ups, the quality of your mock-ups

223
00:18:03,192 --> 00:18:05,073
to save you when things go wrong,

224
00:18:06,793 --> 00:18:12,155
and the quality of the mock-up to extend the perception

225
00:18:12,395 --> 00:18:15,397
of how much live recording you have on a soundtrack.

226
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:24,868
So if you have good mock-ups, you're really going to kind of save yourself from making a budget that's small stick out as being small.

227
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:42,063
So here's an example. We ran into a problem in Budapest where it was in the end of the day we had a kind of like loaf and fanfare-ish moment that needed a specific brass part that was actually that was not right on the paper.

228
00:18:43,447 --> 00:18:44,667
And we didn't have time to fix it.

229
00:18:44,967 --> 00:18:49,309
And we also didn't have really the correct orchestration to support what I was trying to do.

230
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:55,552
Knowing or hearing the sound that you'll hear in a second, I was like, okay, this is not working.

231
00:18:56,272 --> 00:19:00,914
But then I remember my mock-up is actually, it's probably going to save the day on this one.

232
00:19:00,994 --> 00:19:07,236
So I was able to go back and add the mock-up underneath, take out as much as I could,

233
00:19:07,756 --> 00:19:11,098
and then seamlessly kind of mix those together.

234
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,555
so that I could pull it off.

235
00:19:14,576 --> 00:19:15,216
So here's that. ♪♪

236
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:19,418
Yikes. ♪♪

237
00:19:43,868 --> 00:19:44,570
I like that one better.

238
00:19:47,822 --> 00:19:52,986
Another way good mockups and overlays can give you extra mileage is they really allow

239
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:56,089
you to reuse material in interesting ways.

240
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:01,332
And what I mean by that is you're in these recording sessions, you've got tons of material

241
00:20:01,392 --> 00:20:07,577
coming at you, you've got, you know, multiple mics, multiple takes, all this stuff that

242
00:20:07,597 --> 00:20:11,620
you have access to that I would say if you're in a recording session, really try to get

243
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,263
your hands on as much of the material as possible because you can reuse it in cool ways.

244
00:20:17,902 --> 00:20:21,245
and these can be reused by augmenting them.

245
00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:23,827
So say you have just an isolated string part

246
00:20:23,907 --> 00:20:25,048
that you've got from a mic

247
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:28,551
and you can put that as the basis for another track

248
00:20:28,571 --> 00:20:30,633
and start adding extra digital elements over it.

249
00:20:33,736 --> 00:20:37,119
And here is the example of that

250
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:39,281
is actually from the opening cinematic.

251
00:20:39,381 --> 00:20:39,501
So.

252
00:20:40,441 --> 00:20:43,763
The live players themselves playing the cue that I wrote, it was originally going to be

253
00:20:43,803 --> 00:20:45,024
a much more delicate piece.

254
00:20:46,004 --> 00:20:52,028
I decided to amplify it with digital overlays and we ended up, we were able to use it in

255
00:20:52,108 --> 00:20:56,211
multiple places because basically there was a version that was kind of more quiet and

256
00:20:56,251 --> 00:20:59,233
then there was a version that was more amped up.

257
00:20:59,273 --> 00:21:01,654
So here's, you'll see when I play the video.

258
00:21:02,155 --> 00:21:05,577
This is live only.

259
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:23,309
It's basically two different songs.

260
00:21:37,892 --> 00:21:38,112
Right.

261
00:21:39,852 --> 00:21:43,393
Another way to increase mileage off your existing recordings is to use middleware.

262
00:21:43,573 --> 00:21:48,814
So we use Wwise, and like I was saying before, you have these

263
00:21:50,104 --> 00:21:56,568
stems you've got just tons and tons of stems and other recording takes that you can use

264
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,268
and repurpose.

265
00:21:58,249 --> 00:22:04,313
So reusing these recordings is a way of increasing your mileage and they make this, what is a

266
00:22:04,373 --> 00:22:06,134
relatively small budget, go a lot further.

267
00:22:07,167 --> 00:22:16,215
An example of that that we did with Battletech was we had basically a 35 second piece, 35

268
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:21,060
second like stem that was a combined mix of a take that we really didn't use.

269
00:22:22,922 --> 00:22:25,403
But I thought, you know, this could be a great basis for something.

270
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:32,446
In the game, there's a moment where you're headed to a waypoint on the map.

271
00:22:32,806 --> 00:22:36,068
And I knew we had data from the engine that basically told,

272
00:22:36,248 --> 00:22:39,229
could tell Wwise the distance you were from that waypoint.

273
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:45,492
So attaching that to the RTPC, I knew that the closer you got to this waypoint,

274
00:22:45,552 --> 00:22:51,815
I could start to fade in extra digital elements that I'd added on this 35-second string and horn stem.

275
00:22:53,568 --> 00:23:05,880
That basically allowed me to turn what was a 35 second throwaway thing as kind of the basis for part of the soundtrack that is supposed to be kind of an epic moment of you going to get your ship for the first time.

276
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,661
So I'll play that for you here.

277
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:17,310
That's the basic stem there.

278
00:23:23,008 --> 00:23:26,790
The SFX are turned down, by the way.

279
00:23:28,731 --> 00:23:30,511
The percussion starts to come in a little bit.

280
00:23:30,531 --> 00:23:40,395
You can see in Wwise it's just basically RTPCs with stems.

281
00:23:40,655 --> 00:23:43,776
Volume curve up top.

282
00:23:49,878 --> 00:23:51,399
Synth stems start to kind of add in.

283
00:24:20,528 --> 00:24:24,809
So turn a 35 second throwaway stem into something that I could actually use.

284
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:32,212
Another quick tip for increasing mileage with Wwise, I use subtracts a lot in Wwise.

285
00:24:32,252 --> 00:24:36,934
So a subtract, if you don't know, I'm going through a very basic overview of what a subtract

286
00:24:37,014 --> 00:24:37,114
is.

287
00:24:37,174 --> 00:24:37,954
But it's basically...

288
00:24:38,695 --> 00:24:44,740
A way for Wyze to choose which essentially stems to play as a song continues to loop

289
00:24:45,121 --> 00:24:47,523
or when a song gets into a one-shot scenario.

290
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:53,328
So for Battletech, you're on your ship that's called the Argo, and each time you go into

291
00:24:53,348 --> 00:24:56,751
a new room, I wanted to change the music ever so slightly.

292
00:24:57,647 --> 00:25:00,808
And so that way, the way I was going to do that was,

293
00:25:01,808 --> 00:25:05,589
we already had a switch for each room

294
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:08,571
that the engine was going to send into Wwise.

295
00:25:09,171 --> 00:25:11,031
And then each switch that would come into Wwise

296
00:25:11,091 --> 00:25:14,293
would actually tell the sub-track what stems to play,

297
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,494
and it would play basically changing the music,

298
00:25:18,094 --> 00:25:20,595
making what was basically a two-minute loop

299
00:25:20,655 --> 00:25:23,356
into a loop that's always kind of changing and evolving.

300
00:25:23,616 --> 00:25:26,537
So I will play that right now too.

301
00:25:27,888 --> 00:25:31,731
I've got to hand it to Dr. Morales.

302
00:25:31,751 --> 00:25:39,159
This is far more than I can handle for sure.

303
00:26:12,092 --> 00:26:18,116
A way to take what is a two minute track and actually add a lot of variation just by adding subtracts.

304
00:26:18,196 --> 00:26:25,782
Some of those subtracts are just stems from a solo cello recording or stems from our string sections.

305
00:26:27,343 --> 00:26:29,605
It's a really good way to increase your mileage there.

306
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:36,096
So key takeaway, I would say plan early, build R&D into your contract if you can, gather

307
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:40,842
your bids, make sure you work with an entire team you can trust and rely on.

308
00:26:40,902 --> 00:26:41,903
It's a creative effort.

309
00:26:41,963 --> 00:26:43,405
It takes all people working together.

310
00:26:44,651 --> 00:26:46,913
Try to build in a budget buffer for things that go wrong.

311
00:26:47,174 --> 00:26:51,017
If the studio is on the line for that budget, then you're fine.

312
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:57,422
Make sure you use mockups that are convincing that you could ship as is.

313
00:26:57,442 --> 00:27:03,467
And then try to find ways using middleware to reuse recordings in interesting ways.

314
00:27:04,368 --> 00:27:05,909
So that's all I have.

315
00:27:05,929 --> 00:27:06,589
Thanks for your time.

316
00:27:06,629 --> 00:27:08,631
If you have questions, I can take them.

317
00:27:19,182 --> 00:27:19,702
Questions?

318
00:27:24,003 --> 00:27:24,343
Hi, thanks.

319
00:27:24,704 --> 00:27:25,144
Yeah.

320
00:27:25,164 --> 00:27:30,766
You seem to have a lot of processing going on, not necessarily in the music, but in the

321
00:27:30,826 --> 00:27:31,806
producing of the score.

322
00:27:32,466 --> 00:27:36,368
How did you keep track of all the different things that were going on and that were coming

323
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:39,669
from different parts of the world and fit it together into one coherent piece?

324
00:27:40,605 --> 00:27:47,231
Yeah, so I think for me, for this particular product project, that's DynaMedian helped a lot with that.

325
00:27:47,711 --> 00:27:59,161
So they, the things that they helped me with was session contracting, booking, and then delivery of, of editing of the edited live sessions.

326
00:27:59,581 --> 00:28:04,765
So I would go in and we would sit there in the sessions and we would actually take notes on what takes that we liked.

327
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:09,869
I had a whole ledger of that myself, but I relied mostly on their session producer, David

328
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:15,575
Christensen, who's amazing, to work with him on getting the best takes possible and then

329
00:28:15,855 --> 00:28:19,879
digesting those over transfer files and tracking documents and stuff like that.

330
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,742
So those contractors help a lot.

331
00:28:23,062 --> 00:28:27,727
I think doing it yourself is also possible, but I just didn't have the time to do that.

332
00:28:28,468 --> 00:28:28,668
Thanks.

333
00:28:28,928 --> 00:28:29,048
Yeah.

334
00:28:31,217 --> 00:28:31,958
Awesome job, man.

335
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:36,383
So I was curious, what was it like hearing your notes played by real players for the

336
00:28:36,404 --> 00:28:36,884
first time?

337
00:28:37,144 --> 00:28:37,645
How did that feel?

338
00:28:38,933 --> 00:28:43,157
It was terrifying and exciting, right?

339
00:28:43,237 --> 00:28:51,725
Because a lot of times, especially when someone like me who didn't grow up with any live players playing my music,

340
00:28:52,946 --> 00:28:57,149
it was exciting and you're surprised at how things can turn out.

341
00:28:57,209 --> 00:29:02,174
Things that you think will be really easy to play can sometimes be a lot more difficult.

342
00:29:02,734 --> 00:29:05,917
So it's another reason why to hire a good orchestrator.

343
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:11,049
or that things you think will be really difficult just turn out amazingly beautiful

344
00:29:11,089 --> 00:29:14,632
and you're like, wow, I actually know what I'm doing a little bit.

345
00:29:18,034 --> 00:29:23,878
How long did you have from start to finish to produce all of that music?

346
00:29:24,808 --> 00:29:29,030
So I was on the project for about just under three years, I think.

347
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:36,012
And so a lot of that initial stuff, you know, you're writing digital versions of the soundtrack

348
00:29:36,513 --> 00:29:40,054
and then setting up the basis for me because I was doing the implementation myself, setting

349
00:29:40,074 --> 00:29:44,195
up the basis for the game and its implementation structure and stuff.

350
00:29:45,504 --> 00:29:51,208
So, a lot of the groundwork is kind of planning and setting up the Wwise project and stuff,

351
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:55,451
and then, you know, the recording comes much later in the game.

352
00:29:55,811 --> 00:30:01,094
We did record the main theme and some other stuff in Germany about a year and a half into

353
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:03,076
that, so we had some recorded material.

354
00:30:03,956 --> 00:30:10,200
And then Budapest was about, I think, eight months before, or six months before launch,

355
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,922
so it would be a good amount of time.

356
00:30:14,189 --> 00:30:19,554
I really love the blend of orchestral and electronic sounds throughout.

357
00:30:19,574 --> 00:30:25,819
I was wondering if you had any advice for kind of mixing those two sound qualities and

358
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:28,361
making it sound cohesive and unified.

359
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:47,498
Yeah, I agree. I think it's I think they just go really well together, especially, you know, I'm not like an analog synth snob or anything like that. But there's something physical about synths, analog synths in particular. I mean, soft synths also. They just blend really well with strings. I don't know what it is. I'm not sure. But

360
00:30:49,335 --> 00:31:01,110
Yeah, I think it's just trusting your ears. And then also, I think on that list too, is like if your ears are deceiving you, run it by a mixer and just say, hey, what advice do you have? Or say, you know, I'll pay for...

361
00:31:02,018 --> 00:31:03,779
half an hour of looking through a few of my songs.

362
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:11,224
And we have a mixer for our cinematics, which were a lot of hybrid stuff, and he did a great

363
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:11,484
job.

364
00:31:11,804 --> 00:31:16,187
His name's Chris Burgess, and he's also good, he's really into analog synths, too, so he

365
00:31:16,227 --> 00:31:17,188
knows that sound.

366
00:31:17,948 --> 00:31:20,890
But it just all comes down to trusting your ears, you know, if it sounds good to you,

367
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:23,352
it's probably going to sound good to some other people also.

368
00:31:27,915 --> 00:31:28,856
All right, we got time.

369
00:31:29,896 --> 00:31:30,156
Thanks, guys.

370
00:31:30,176 --> 00:31:30,397
Thanks, guys.
