1
00:00:05,317 --> 00:00:10,779
Basically, over the years, Great Britain has actually had some very, very talented

2
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:17,283
developers. People like Jez Sand, Tony Crowther, David Braben, Jeff Minter. These are the

3
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:23,766
people that I grew up like. They were the stars when I was first playing games. These

4
00:00:23,766 --> 00:00:29,989
guys became very, very famous in England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. However,

5
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:34,291
very few British developers really make a name for themselves here in America.

6
00:00:34,837 --> 00:00:37,778
and no, calling yourself Lord British, that doesn't count.

7
00:00:37,778 --> 00:00:42,940
Judging by how many people there are here today, actually,

8
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,841
you can see that our speaker has actually already started

9
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:46,801
to change all of that.

10
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:52,283
In the time that he's been making games,

11
00:00:52,283 --> 00:00:55,704
he's already accomplished a lot more than most video game

12
00:00:55,704 --> 00:00:57,204
designers would ever hope for.

13
00:00:57,204 --> 00:00:59,845
He can be as creative as he likes.

14
00:00:59,845 --> 00:01:03,846
He can design absolutely anything that comes into his mind.

15
00:01:04,741 --> 00:01:10,163
he's extremely talented and so people are dying to work with him. Any publisher out there would

16
00:01:10,163 --> 00:01:16,284
be really happy to fund a project with his name on it and most importantly, when he makes a

17
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:21,246
game, he decides whenever the publisher is going to get to ship it, which is a great situation.

18
00:01:22,267 --> 00:01:27,028
I personally look up to him as a true visionary in this business. I recently spent a few hours

19
00:01:27,028 --> 00:01:32,651
with him in the Cheers bar in Boston. And if you get to spend some time with him, you'll

20
00:01:32,651 --> 00:01:38,533
realize how much he truly loves this industry. His passion for creativity and his interest

21
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:43,815
in new design ideas is really infectious. And as he's demonstrated in the past with

22
00:01:43,815 --> 00:01:48,317
Populous, Theme Park, with Dungeon Keeper, and now with Black and White.

23
00:01:49,573 --> 00:01:55,177
I think he's shown that he's never scared to steer his ship into uncharted waters.

24
00:01:55,177 --> 00:01:59,660
Peter is an advisory board member of this conference, and we are truly honored that

25
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,963
he's taken the time to fly over here to share his insights with all of us.

26
00:02:03,963 --> 00:02:08,726
So if you'd join me in a round of applause, I'd like to welcome Mr. Peter Malno.

27
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:24,610
Well, thank you very much Dave, and I could endorse and repeat all the things you say about Dave.

28
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,175
He's been a visionary to me as well.

29
00:02:26,715 --> 00:02:28,417
What I thought we'd do today is,

30
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:31,359
what I'd like to do is show you and share with you

31
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:35,522
some of the visions that have been going through my mind

32
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,463
when I've been creating the latest game

33
00:02:37,463 --> 00:02:39,185
called Black and White.

34
00:02:39,185 --> 00:02:43,608
And what I'm gonna do is go through a number of slides

35
00:02:43,608 --> 00:02:47,151
that really give an indication of what that vision was

36
00:02:47,151 --> 00:02:48,412
and where it came from.

37
00:02:48,412 --> 00:02:52,595
So, start off with the first one, who I am.

38
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:54,997
I started in the industry back in 1987.

39
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,182
I started in the industry because I was starving

40
00:02:59,182 --> 00:03:03,024
and running a company and thinking how the hell am I going to get enough money

41
00:03:03,024 --> 00:03:06,767
together to eat the next meal.

42
00:03:07,873 --> 00:03:12,116
And I've been very, very lucky to work with some extremely talented people.

43
00:03:12,116 --> 00:03:15,599
My first game ever was a game called Populous.

44
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,682
And I had no idea, absolutely no idea

45
00:03:20,682 --> 00:03:25,665
that what I was creating other people would even like, let alone buy.

46
00:03:25,665 --> 00:03:28,207
And that's where it all started. And since then...

47
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,963
the games industry has been a total, total passion for me,

48
00:03:31,963 --> 00:03:34,246
and I think, I hope you'll realize that

49
00:03:34,246 --> 00:03:35,627
from what I'm saying today.

50
00:03:35,627 --> 00:03:40,573
So, where did the black and white inspiration come from?

51
00:03:40,573 --> 00:03:42,315
Just to set the scene a little bit,

52
00:03:42,315 --> 00:03:44,898
I started a company up called Lionhead

53
00:03:44,898 --> 00:03:47,140
almost three years ago now.

54
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,723
And the first game that Lionhead did

55
00:03:49,723 --> 00:03:51,205
had to be very impressive.

56
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:55,506
And I've always got my inspiration from a number of sources.

57
00:03:55,506 --> 00:03:58,448
Films and music are terribly, terribly important to me.

58
00:03:58,448 --> 00:04:01,170
In particular, there were two films

59
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,492
that gave me inspiration for this.

60
00:04:03,492 --> 00:04:05,954
The first one, which I'd love to show you a clip from,

61
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,457
but I haven't got it, is a film called King Kong.

62
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:13,221
The original 1933 film of King Kong, with a huge ape.

63
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:17,202
which unbelievably the filmmakers made you care about.

64
00:04:17,202 --> 00:04:21,304
And I wept like a baby within the final scene

65
00:04:21,304 --> 00:04:23,485
when the little biplanes were flying over

66
00:04:23,485 --> 00:04:24,545
and shooting King Kong.

67
00:04:24,545 --> 00:04:27,207
And I thought, when I was thinking about the next game,

68
00:04:27,207 --> 00:04:30,188
God, if I could weep over a giant.

69
00:04:30,739 --> 00:04:32,280
ugly creature like that.

70
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,302
That is just an amazing emotional pull.

71
00:04:35,302 --> 00:04:37,383
So that was the first film that inspired me.

72
00:04:37,383 --> 00:04:41,045
The second film was an episode of The Outer Limits.

73
00:04:41,045 --> 00:04:44,027
I love science fiction, like I'm sure we all do.

74
00:04:44,027 --> 00:04:47,189
We wouldn't be in this industry if we didn't.

75
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:50,431
And I'm going to show you a tiny little clip,

76
00:04:50,431 --> 00:04:52,372
and when I saw this scene,

77
00:04:52,372 --> 00:04:54,873
the idea for Black and White popped into my mind.

78
00:04:54,873 --> 00:04:56,514
It's not a very long clip, and it's...

79
00:04:56,514 --> 00:04:58,335
The Outer Limits.

80
00:05:00,248 --> 00:05:02,451
There's basically an episode called The Sand Kings,

81
00:05:02,451 --> 00:05:05,073
and this guy finds these alien eggs and brings them up

82
00:05:05,073 --> 00:05:07,716
and realizes that they have intelligence.

83
00:05:07,716 --> 00:05:10,378
And it was when he realized that they had intelligence,

84
00:05:10,378 --> 00:05:12,060
in this very scene here,

85
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,022
where he was standing in front of the cage

86
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:14,943
and there was this little...

87
00:05:15,624 --> 00:05:19,706
These little creatures just running around his feet.

88
00:05:19,706 --> 00:05:23,128
I realized that that was the feeling of power.

89
00:05:23,128 --> 00:05:28,032
And it's a feeling of power that I really wanted to imbue...

90
00:05:28,032 --> 00:05:30,393
imbue to people that played games.

91
00:05:31,013 --> 00:05:38,237
And also the feeling of fun as well, that they react to what you do, that they seem to be intelligent, if you like.

92
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:44,260
And it's this seeming to be intelligent bit in the game that I really, really enjoy.

93
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:50,662
But this scene coming up here is really what I want games players to feel when they play Black & White.

94
00:05:50,662 --> 00:05:53,824
I want them to feel what it would be like...

95
00:05:54,204 --> 00:05:56,625
to be a god amongst these masses.

96
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:59,127
And it's the expression on this guy's face

97
00:05:59,127 --> 00:06:00,447
in a second that when you see it

98
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:03,429
is kind of what I want people to feel

99
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:04,790
when they play the game.

100
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:12,314
He's going to make the expression in a second.

101
00:06:12,314 --> 00:06:17,096
It's that expression there that I really wanted to

102
00:06:17,096 --> 00:06:19,357
wanted to get from people.

103
00:06:19,357 --> 00:06:19,397
So...

104
00:06:21,285 --> 00:06:22,686
That is a huge experience.

105
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:26,687
The other experience is about being a child.

106
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:29,769
When you're a kid, those images in my mind

107
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:31,449
are still incredibly strong.

108
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:36,111
And I remember a key, key moment in my childhood

109
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:39,032
was when I was walking through the woods one day

110
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:41,073
and I happened upon an ant's nest.

111
00:06:41,073 --> 00:06:42,553
Like every kid.

112
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:44,495
has ever, ever happened upon.

113
00:06:44,495 --> 00:06:45,595
It happened upon my ancestors.

114
00:06:45,595 --> 00:06:47,656
Of course, the very first thing I wanted to do

115
00:06:47,656 --> 00:06:49,558
is pick up a stick and just destroy

116
00:06:49,558 --> 00:06:52,920
as many of these little suckers as I possibly could.

117
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,021
So I got the stick and rummaged around in there,

118
00:06:55,021 --> 00:06:57,242
but actually I found that, you know,

119
00:06:57,242 --> 00:06:59,043
if I dropped a little sweet by the side,

120
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,185
they'd come out and they'd start eating the sweet,

121
00:07:01,185 --> 00:07:03,967
and it kind of, in a way, was like that film clip.

122
00:07:04,147 --> 00:07:11,108
But when I was a when I was kid the fact that you had this world this little ant colony world

123
00:07:11,108 --> 00:07:16,049
which you were sort of dealing and interacting with with you which again is just a feeling of

124
00:07:16,049 --> 00:07:18,230
immense pleasure for me and

125
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:23,431
Also, the other thing is a toy called action man now most of you

126
00:07:23,431 --> 00:07:29,152
Probably as kids had action men and if you're anything like me you are unspeakably cruel to your action man

127
00:07:29,692 --> 00:07:34,314
After a while, you know, my action man ended up torched with a blowtorch,

128
00:07:34,314 --> 00:07:36,755
and was the final thing that I did for them.

129
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:40,876
But it was these scenarios I used to make with the kid, with my action man,

130
00:07:40,876 --> 00:07:45,198
always involving him dying in some horrible, horrible way.

131
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:49,519
And it's this marriage between those two which is particularly interesting.

132
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,902
Those are two big experiences, so you can get the feeling that I wanted to create a world,

133
00:07:55,902 --> 00:07:58,063
but also from the action man and the King Kong side,

134
00:07:58,063 --> 00:08:02,544
I also wanted to create a creature, something that seemed real.

135
00:08:02,544 --> 00:08:07,446
And what I'm going to do now is just go back through a few of my games

136
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:14,569
and just have a look at those games and what mistakes that I've made in those games

137
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:18,051
and how I hope Black & White will rectify some of those mistakes.

138
00:08:19,163 --> 00:08:21,204
So the first game I did was Populous.

139
00:08:21,204 --> 00:08:24,324
Well, the game was really, really simple.

140
00:08:24,324 --> 00:08:26,205
You just clicked, raise and lower land,

141
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,245
and you had little people reacting to it.

142
00:08:28,245 --> 00:08:30,746
But the big problem with Populous,

143
00:08:30,746 --> 00:08:34,286
or the huge problem, the problem that always came

144
00:08:34,286 --> 00:08:36,247
when I showed it to any members of the press

145
00:08:36,247 --> 00:08:38,107
is there was no story.

146
00:08:38,107 --> 00:08:41,168
There was 500 levels which you played through,

147
00:08:41,168 --> 00:08:42,308
and I have to confess now,

148
00:08:42,308 --> 00:08:44,308
this is a confession that I'm going to make.

149
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:49,292
that those 500 levels were all completely randomly generated.

150
00:08:49,292 --> 00:08:53,876
It wasn't that I handcrafted each one of the 500 levels

151
00:08:53,876 --> 00:08:57,219
and personally tweaked it all, not at all.

152
00:08:57,219 --> 00:09:00,923
In fact, it was a column of numbers which I,

153
00:09:00,923 --> 00:09:04,346
which were filled in which generated the world.

154
00:09:04,346 --> 00:09:07,729
And the biggest confession of all was the data disks,

155
00:09:07,729 --> 00:09:11,192
if anybody you've played called the Promised Lands,

156
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:14,714
What I did was take that column of numbers

157
00:09:14,714 --> 00:09:15,715
and reversed it round.

158
00:09:15,715 --> 00:09:20,157
And that was the balancing on the promised lands.

159
00:09:20,157 --> 00:09:21,498
And I'm ashamed about it,

160
00:09:21,498 --> 00:09:23,339
and I feel I need to confess about it,

161
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:26,541
and I'm really, really sorry, but there you go.

162
00:09:29,728 --> 00:09:34,350
The other problem with Populous was the fact that it was repetitive gameplay.

163
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,850
It was the same thing over and over again.

164
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,711
Now that's fine, that's cool.

165
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:44,032
It's cool to do that, but also one of the real excitements for me about playing games is discovery.

166
00:09:44,032 --> 00:09:49,873
It's discovering that I can get more powerful, it's discovering more and more features in the game.

167
00:09:49,873 --> 00:09:52,974
And once you played the first level of Populous, that was it, really.

168
00:09:53,374 --> 00:09:55,936
So, you know, there's certainly room for improvement there.

169
00:09:55,936 --> 00:10:01,119
Now, the next game I'd like to talk about is a game called Powermonger.

170
00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:07,003
It was probably the biggest disappointment in all of the games that I've done.

171
00:10:07,003 --> 00:10:09,064
It was a real world that I was trying to build,

172
00:10:09,064 --> 00:10:15,468
you know, that was full of little people again, and they went out and did their jobs.

173
00:10:15,468 --> 00:10:16,869
But it didn't have a story again.

174
00:10:16,869 --> 00:10:20,051
Another problem was a succession of levels.

175
00:10:20,271 --> 00:10:23,612
it was a terribly over-complicated interface.

176
00:10:23,612 --> 00:10:26,172
If you can just see down in the bottom section,

177
00:10:26,172 --> 00:10:29,093
the number of icons that were around there,

178
00:10:29,093 --> 00:10:30,953
I think there was something like 32 icons.

179
00:10:30,953 --> 00:10:34,434
Now asking somebody to remember 32 icons

180
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,134
and what they do is just too much.

181
00:10:36,134 --> 00:10:39,735
You know, one of the things that I try and think about

182
00:10:39,735 --> 00:10:43,456
these days is to realize that in your short-term memory,

183
00:10:43,456 --> 00:10:46,016
in the average human short-term memory,

184
00:10:46,016 --> 00:10:48,277
you can remember seven things.

185
00:10:48,277 --> 00:10:49,737
And that's if you're pretty exceptional.

186
00:10:49,979 --> 00:10:53,521
If you're not exceptional, it's probably more like five things.

187
00:10:53,521 --> 00:10:56,564
And so once you've asked someone to do the sixth thing,

188
00:10:56,564 --> 00:11:00,627
to remember where the sixth thing is, it's an effort.

189
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:04,210
And you feel like, oh god, now where was that icon?

190
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,331
What did that icon do?

191
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,613
Where was that person in the world?

192
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:10,536
And that is the sort of things that we have to really,

193
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:11,477
really think about now.

194
00:11:11,477 --> 00:11:15,800
So a little bit of inspiration on the interface side

195
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,382
from Powermonger.

196
00:11:18,983 --> 00:11:21,466
And then Syndicate, which is, you know,

197
00:11:21,466 --> 00:11:24,488
was a really, which was a little bit different for me.

198
00:11:24,488 --> 00:11:28,091
One of the things you'll notice with all of these slides

199
00:11:28,091 --> 00:11:30,814
is that there is a common link between all my games.

200
00:11:30,814 --> 00:11:33,256
And the common link is little people.

201
00:11:33,256 --> 00:11:35,838
Every single game I've done has a little person

202
00:11:35,838 --> 00:11:37,079
in it somewhere in there.

203
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:39,781
Even Syndicate, even Magic Carpet,

204
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:41,803
which seemed to be flying around on a carpet

205
00:11:41,803 --> 00:11:43,044
and shooting down monsters,

206
00:11:43,044 --> 00:11:44,605
they've all got little people in there.

207
00:11:45,265 --> 00:11:52,127
Now the cool thing about Syndicate, yes it was an action game set in a simulation, a simulation of a city.

208
00:11:52,127 --> 00:11:56,228
But again, I tried to sort of think about a story for it

209
00:11:56,228 --> 00:12:01,810
and the story behind Syndicate was that you had these chips that you could plug into your head

210
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,211
but it was completely outside the game.

211
00:12:04,211 --> 00:12:09,272
Once you got into a level, then that was it. You were playing a shoot-em-up, essentially.

212
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:15,253
There wasn't any of the story sort of coming out within the gameplay side.

213
00:12:15,253 --> 00:12:19,274
And part of that was the limitation of the systems we were playing on now,

214
00:12:19,274 --> 00:12:21,415
and part of that was that, you know,

215
00:12:21,415 --> 00:12:27,196
I had always focused on the gameplay element and not the story element.

216
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:29,816
I now think that that's a little bit of a mistake.

217
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:34,757
I think the story and the narrative is as important as the gameplay mechanism,

218
00:12:34,757 --> 00:12:36,398
providing the two marry themselves together.

219
00:12:38,515 --> 00:12:46,420
Then came Magic Carpet. It was really the first 3D game as such.

220
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:52,343
It had a fantastic 3D engine written by a brilliant person called Glenn Corpus

221
00:12:52,343 --> 00:12:55,225
who worked with me on all of the games.

222
00:12:55,225 --> 00:12:57,226
And really he excelled himself here.

223
00:12:57,226 --> 00:12:59,607
We still had little people, as you can see, down the bottom there.

224
00:12:59,607 --> 00:13:01,508
I sneaked them in there at the last moment.

225
00:13:01,508 --> 00:13:03,709
I just couldn't bear having a game without them.

226
00:13:04,678 --> 00:13:08,080
And the trouble with, the only problem with Magic Carpet,

227
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,381
its interface was quite simple,

228
00:13:09,381 --> 00:13:12,663
but it was repetitive gameplay again.

229
00:13:12,663 --> 00:13:14,564
And I tried to construct opponents.

230
00:13:14,564 --> 00:13:17,887
I tried to encourage the team to construct opponents,

231
00:13:17,887 --> 00:13:19,968
but really they lacked personality.

232
00:13:19,968 --> 00:13:22,690
There wasn't any way for them to express

233
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:26,032
their personality to you and to offer challenges to you.

234
00:13:26,717 --> 00:13:32,061
And it turned out that towards the middle and the end of the project,

235
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,582
it was just too darn difficult.

236
00:13:34,582 --> 00:13:37,945
One of the things that I try to think to myself is,

237
00:13:37,945 --> 00:13:41,107
we're not trying to build games that beat people.

238
00:13:41,107 --> 00:13:44,190
We're trying to build games that entertain people.

239
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,632
And that means you have to make a game challenging, absolutely,

240
00:13:47,632 --> 00:13:51,735
but not challenging to the point where it's just so darn difficult

241
00:13:51,735 --> 00:13:53,537
that you just can't complete it.

242
00:13:53,617 --> 00:13:59,118
The perfect game, I believe, is one where you can go through and you can play it

243
00:13:59,118 --> 00:14:02,739
and you have a challenge, you have to think about a challenge a little bit,

244
00:14:02,739 --> 00:14:04,039
but you get to solve it.

245
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:06,860
And there's many, many fine game examples of those.

246
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:13,201
The next game, which was madly successful in Japan and in Europe,

247
00:14:13,201 --> 00:14:17,102
but not very successful in America at all, was a game called Theme Park,

248
00:14:17,102 --> 00:14:19,283
where you design and build your own theme park.

249
00:14:20,347 --> 00:14:23,308
The big problem here was, again, no challenges,

250
00:14:23,308 --> 00:14:27,129
but the graphics were just too childish for the US market.

251
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:29,130
You know, when people saw it,

252
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:34,192
they naturally thought it was an entertainment product,

253
00:14:34,192 --> 00:14:36,093
sorry, an edutainment product.

254
00:14:36,093 --> 00:14:38,254
And they were, you know, a little bit turned off

255
00:14:38,254 --> 00:14:40,475
by the graphical portion of it.

256
00:14:40,475 --> 00:14:43,737
Also, there wasn't nearly enough destruction in it.

257
00:14:44,352 --> 00:14:50,201
I should have put in just these death-defying roller coasters that just killed off half the people that traveled on them.

258
00:14:51,102 --> 00:14:56,264
You know, I should have put in food poisoning at the hamburger store.

259
00:14:56,264 --> 00:15:01,405
I should have had mass global deaths on the extreme fast rides,

260
00:15:01,405 --> 00:15:03,125
and it would have been so much cooler.

261
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:07,106
Anyone making a theme park game out of there, just go do it.

262
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,927
The disasters, when you're sitting on a roller coaster,

263
00:15:09,927 --> 00:15:11,207
you're always thinking,

264
00:15:11,207 --> 00:15:14,948
is this sucker going to keep together before I reach the end of the ride?

265
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:18,269
And wouldn't it be cool to have a game where, well, it didn't quite do that.

266
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:26,203
And the last game that I did, and probably the game I made the biggest mistakes over,

267
00:15:26,203 --> 00:15:28,164
was a game called Dungeon Keeper.

268
00:15:28,164 --> 00:15:32,286
I thought that concept for a game where you play the bad guy,

269
00:15:32,286 --> 00:15:36,328
where you play, you know, everything you do has to be bad,

270
00:15:36,328 --> 00:15:42,192
you're the big opponent in this dungeon, was a very cool concept.

271
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:44,473
But it was just an awful interface.

272
00:15:44,473 --> 00:15:47,294
I mean the icons, there were tons of them.

273
00:15:47,294 --> 00:15:50,356
And I managed to double the number of icons that...

274
00:15:50,476 --> 00:15:55,499
that Powermonger had to some 64 different icons.

275
00:15:55,499 --> 00:15:59,561
The game features were too hidden.

276
00:15:59,561 --> 00:16:02,582
I mean, I've never seen a hint book

277
00:16:02,582 --> 00:16:06,184
that actually uncovers all the tricks

278
00:16:06,184 --> 00:16:08,165
within the game that you could do.

279
00:16:08,165 --> 00:16:10,106
I mean, there was a little cheat in there

280
00:16:10,106 --> 00:16:12,027
that enabled you to have the...

281
00:16:12,027 --> 00:16:14,969
There was a character called the Mistress,

282
00:16:14,969 --> 00:16:17,190
and there was a cheat in there that enabled her to...

283
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:20,193
become naked, which I don't think anybody ever found.

284
00:16:20,193 --> 00:16:24,616
It's all very well putting these little Easter eggs

285
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:27,219
in there, but if they're so darn hard to find,

286
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:30,582
then you just wasted your time and the graphic artist's time.

287
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,831
Again, no opponent personality.

288
00:16:33,831 --> 00:16:37,272
It would have been so cool in that game to have the heroes,

289
00:16:37,272 --> 00:16:41,633
the people trying to conquer your dungeon, to have real personalities

290
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:47,214
that were kings of the land that were trying to send questing knights in there.

291
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,315
I could have done a lot more with it.

292
00:16:49,315 --> 00:16:54,056
And what it ended up with is a sort of dungeon fest, if you like,

293
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:56,196
where you could...

294
00:16:56,677 --> 00:17:02,539
Build your dungeon up put your creatures in there and fight against someone else. It could have been an awful lot more

295
00:17:02,539 --> 00:17:07,681
so those are the sort of influences bubbling around in my mind and

296
00:17:07,681 --> 00:17:14,883
that led us to the first meeting of Lionhead where we sat down and I

297
00:17:14,883 --> 00:17:19,645
Knew I kind of knew what black and white must have I sort of must have list

298
00:17:20,702 --> 00:17:24,767
And the first in the must-have list was it had to be so impressive.

299
00:17:24,767 --> 00:17:27,731
The games industry is a deeply scary place.

300
00:17:27,731 --> 00:17:33,157
I've walked around the Royal Toronto D.C. this time and it terrifies me.

301
00:17:33,157 --> 00:17:36,922
The quality which all you guys are putting out is amazing.

302
00:17:37,675 --> 00:17:40,796
And you know, as a small studio you have to compete with that

303
00:17:40,796 --> 00:17:45,157
and you have to compete with it on a level and make something which is

304
00:17:45,157 --> 00:17:47,097
fantastic in every aspect.

305
00:17:47,097 --> 00:17:52,459
Fantastic graphics, fantastic gameplay, fantastic story, fantastic narrative

306
00:17:52,459 --> 00:17:55,099
and it's just a really, really, really tough thing to do.

307
00:17:55,099 --> 00:17:59,140
But with all that, fantastic things that we can put together,

308
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,921
all this complexity we can put together,

309
00:18:01,921 --> 00:18:06,042
one of the things it must have, it must be simple to play.

310
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:07,502
It's got to be simple to play.

311
00:18:08,222 --> 00:18:13,765
You all watch MTV now, and MTV has destroyed your minds completely

312
00:18:13,765 --> 00:18:17,827
because your attention span is about 10 seconds now.

313
00:18:17,827 --> 00:18:20,008
That means I've got 10 seconds,

314
00:18:20,008 --> 00:18:25,931
10 seconds to firstly explain about what the game is,

315
00:18:25,931 --> 00:18:30,033
10 seconds to persuade you to play the game,

316
00:18:30,033 --> 00:18:34,795
10 seconds to show you something cool happening in the game.

317
00:18:34,975 --> 00:18:38,238
And that is tough to do, and the secret is simplicity.

318
00:18:38,238 --> 00:18:41,001
Not dumbing down, but just pure simplicity.

319
00:18:41,001 --> 00:18:44,944
The other thing, as you can see from my past games,

320
00:18:44,944 --> 00:18:48,267
what it had to have, what black and white had to have,

321
00:18:48,267 --> 00:18:50,048
was a compulsive story.

322
00:18:50,048 --> 00:18:54,392
But not just any old story, a story, and this was real ambition of mine,

323
00:18:54,392 --> 00:18:57,535
a story which would be unique to you.

324
00:18:57,535 --> 00:18:59,897
And this is what represents black and white,

325
00:18:59,897 --> 00:19:02,319
the uniqueness to the player himself.

326
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,921
And that's what computer games can do.

327
00:19:05,921 --> 00:19:09,322
The fantastic thing that they can do is they can,

328
00:19:09,322 --> 00:19:11,983
we can make games now that are unique

329
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:13,284
to each person that plays it.

330
00:19:13,284 --> 00:19:16,525
And there is no other entertainment medium

331
00:19:16,525 --> 00:19:18,286
in the history of our civilization

332
00:19:18,286 --> 00:19:20,367
that's had the ability to do that

333
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,668
since the tribal storyteller,

334
00:19:22,668 --> 00:19:25,569
who used to go from town to town and tell his stories.

335
00:19:25,569 --> 00:19:27,010
And what he used to do,

336
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:28,931
a tribal storyteller used to go from town to town

337
00:19:28,931 --> 00:19:30,691
and explain and tell a story.

338
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:32,112
And if you've got to laugh.

339
00:19:32,812 --> 00:19:34,634
He changed the story a bit.

340
00:19:34,634 --> 00:19:37,317
If he got people crying, he's changed the story a bit.

341
00:19:37,317 --> 00:19:40,139
And that's what we can do in the games industry.

342
00:19:40,139 --> 00:19:42,802
We can look at players, and if we're clever,

343
00:19:42,802 --> 00:19:45,084
we can modify our games and change our games

344
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:46,946
to enable everybody who plays a game

345
00:19:46,946 --> 00:19:48,848
to have an entertaining experience.

346
00:19:48,848 --> 00:19:49,889
Absolutely fantastic.

347
00:19:50,907 --> 00:19:54,069
It had to have state-of-the-art technology, state-of-the-art gameplay,

348
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:56,930
state-of-the-art AI engine, state-of-the-art physics engine,

349
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:02,434
state-of-the-art graphics 3D engine, state-of-the-art interface, all of those.

350
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:06,636
And it had to be unique and original, but it had to be understandable.

351
00:20:06,636 --> 00:20:09,518
You know, uniqueness and originality has its risks.

352
00:20:09,518 --> 00:20:15,022
And the risk is that you make something so unique that nobody understands it.

353
00:20:15,022 --> 00:20:16,903
And that is a huge, huge problem.

354
00:20:16,903 --> 00:20:16,943
So...

355
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:21,176
The next thing I did was that we did at Lionhead,

356
00:20:21,176 --> 00:20:22,877
it was to make a team.

357
00:20:22,877 --> 00:20:25,559
And it's all very well for me to stand up on this forum

358
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:29,222
and say all these things, but it's all of these people here

359
00:20:29,222 --> 00:20:32,124
on this list that make this game, not just me.

360
00:20:32,124 --> 00:20:36,428
And they're all totally, totally brilliant people.

361
00:20:36,428 --> 00:20:38,589
And then when we constructed the team,

362
00:20:38,589 --> 00:20:41,311
the first thing that we did was to make

363
00:20:41,311 --> 00:20:43,113
what's called a test bed version.

364
00:20:43,865 --> 00:20:46,251
which I'll show you now.

365
00:20:46,251 --> 00:20:50,583
This is the first screenshot of black and white

366
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,068
that I showed some 18 months ago.

367
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:57,531
You'd be pretty disappointed if that was all you were going to see today, I'm sure.

368
00:20:57,531 --> 00:21:02,513
But it really, this testbed, allows us to try some of the game mechanics out.

369
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:11,796
When you're making something new, it is incredibly hard and difficult to actually wait until the end of the project

370
00:21:11,796 --> 00:21:15,057
before you test the most risky elements of it.

371
00:21:15,057 --> 00:21:16,018
It's far better.

372
00:21:16,578 --> 00:21:20,583
to actually make the most graphically horrible thing that you could ever imagine.

373
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:23,467
And in fact, if you look very closely at this,

374
00:21:23,467 --> 00:21:28,113
those little dots down in the middle are little sprites from Theme Park.

375
00:21:28,113 --> 00:21:31,237
The buildings are from another game that I was working on.

376
00:21:31,638 --> 00:21:35,980
The landscape is obviously no engine at all, it's just a mesh.

377
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:40,401
But what you could do in this testbed is play the game.

378
00:21:40,401 --> 00:21:42,702
You could try some of the elements out.

379
00:21:42,702 --> 00:21:47,404
And that's so darn important if you're going to spend years,

380
00:21:47,404 --> 00:21:52,466
literally years of your life working and playing on the game.

381
00:21:52,466 --> 00:21:59,349
So, that led to the design of the black and white.

382
00:22:00,405 --> 00:22:08,288
What is it? Well, what Black and White is, is a role-playing game where you play the role of a god.

383
00:22:08,288 --> 00:22:17,492
As you play a role of the god, as the story unfolds, you find you have the ability to

384
00:22:17,492 --> 00:22:21,473
take one creature in the world, and I'll be demonstrating this in a minute,

385
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:26,135
one creature in the world and nurture it and grow it up and give it whatever personality you like.

386
00:22:27,503 --> 00:22:31,885
It is set within an amazing simulated world,

387
00:22:31,885 --> 00:22:35,766
which is the most realistic which I could possibly imagine at the moment,

388
00:22:35,766 --> 00:22:40,307
and a world that allows you to do absolutely anything you like in.

389
00:22:40,307 --> 00:22:43,648
It's a game which hopefully balances itself,

390
00:22:43,648 --> 00:22:48,290
and that's a very, very bold claim, and I hope it's going to come off,

391
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:53,091
but what it does is tries to pace itself

392
00:22:53,091 --> 00:22:55,332
by looking at the way that you're playing the game.

393
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:59,852
And it's a game that allows the player to be himself.

394
00:22:59,852 --> 00:23:02,894
In other words, within this world, within the story,

395
00:23:02,894 --> 00:23:08,858
you can be as evil, cruel, nasty and despicable as you like.

396
00:23:08,858 --> 00:23:13,121
Or you can be wonderfully kind, generous and caring as you want.

397
00:23:13,121 --> 00:23:17,565
And it's those two opposites and everything in between

398
00:23:17,565 --> 00:23:19,946
which came up with the name of Black and White.

399
00:23:19,946 --> 00:23:24,089
From the darkest, deepest black to the brightest white.

400
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:27,393
And what Black and White doesn't do is say,

401
00:23:27,393 --> 00:23:30,677
thou shalt be, thou shalt be good, thou shalt be evil,

402
00:23:30,677 --> 00:23:33,199
thou shalt be this character, thou shalt be that character.

403
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:36,143
It allows you to be whichever character you like.

404
00:23:37,852 --> 00:23:43,494
And these shots down here are the first conceptual shots, if you like, of the game.

405
00:23:43,494 --> 00:23:49,757
Now, the one in the middle is a character from Dungeon Keeper.

406
00:23:49,757 --> 00:23:53,798
And you can just see probably these tiny little dots down the bottom.

407
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:58,740
And that's the feeling of scale that I got from King Kong.

408
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,061
You know, this feeling that this is your creature.

409
00:24:01,061 --> 00:24:04,782
He's not a little thing. He's a hugely powerful, incredibly strong creature.

410
00:24:04,782 --> 00:24:06,443
And you can make him whatever you like.

411
00:24:06,803 --> 00:24:12,068
And there on the left or right is the ape creature,

412
00:24:12,068 --> 00:24:15,691
the first idea we had for a creature in the game.

413
00:24:15,691 --> 00:24:21,056
And the image on the left is your citadel where you reside.

414
00:24:21,056 --> 00:24:25,780
So before we have a look at the demo,

415
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:32,306
let's have a look at some of the technology within Black & White.

416
00:24:33,112 --> 00:24:37,453
It's all very well having these great ideals for a game,

417
00:24:37,453 --> 00:24:40,634
but you need some great technology to make that happen.

418
00:24:40,634 --> 00:24:42,794
Firstly, there's a multi-view 3D engine

419
00:24:42,794 --> 00:24:46,995
that allows you to view the world from any aspect you like.

420
00:24:46,995 --> 00:24:53,497
Secondly, there's what we're calling multi-scaling AI,

421
00:24:53,497 --> 00:24:56,418
which allows you to see this world

422
00:24:56,418 --> 00:24:58,698
in simulation at any point.

423
00:24:59,537 --> 00:25:02,159
Also, that AI is applied to the creature.

424
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:07,683
The creature is certainly the most amazing AI that I've ever worked on.

425
00:25:07,683 --> 00:25:10,345
I think it's, some would say, foolishly ambitious,

426
00:25:10,345 --> 00:25:15,309
but I can really honestly say that the creature that you're going to see today

427
00:25:15,309 --> 00:25:19,753
is the most amazing creature that I've certainly seen in any games industry,

428
00:25:19,753 --> 00:25:22,855
and it even stands up against some academic AI.

429
00:25:24,505 --> 00:25:27,286
A world-class physics engine.

430
00:25:27,286 --> 00:25:31,107
I wanted the things that you move around and that you manipulate

431
00:25:31,107 --> 00:25:33,607
to actually be real physics objects.

432
00:25:33,607 --> 00:25:37,028
So you're going to see a real physics engine working.

433
00:25:37,028 --> 00:25:41,549
A multi-threaded story, a multi-threaded interactive story interface

434
00:25:41,549 --> 00:25:45,350
which allows you to trigger story events when you like

435
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:51,671
and also allows there to be a huge number of different solutions to that story.

436
00:25:53,116 --> 00:25:59,198
The idea of gesture recognition, that you can make shapes and the game recognizes which shapes you make,

437
00:25:59,198 --> 00:26:03,200
which activates certain power-ups within the spells.

438
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:10,462
An icon-less interface which allows you to manipulate the world without the need of the clutter of my previous games.

439
00:26:12,472 --> 00:26:15,594
Things like real-time lip syncing and emotion syncing,

440
00:26:15,594 --> 00:26:21,199
which means that the creature's face, when you interact with him,

441
00:26:21,199 --> 00:26:25,222
will actually animate and speak words,

442
00:26:25,222 --> 00:26:28,765
and you'll actually be able to recognise them from the motions.

443
00:26:29,984 --> 00:26:32,546
A thing called conversation learning,

444
00:26:32,546 --> 00:26:35,388
where when your creature will learn how to speak

445
00:26:35,388 --> 00:26:38,611
and talk like you when you're online with him.

446
00:26:38,611 --> 00:26:39,852
I won't be showing that today,

447
00:26:39,852 --> 00:26:42,774
but it's incredibly, incredibly cool.

448
00:26:42,774 --> 00:26:46,658
And a world which essentially balances himself.

449
00:26:46,658 --> 00:26:50,941
So, in summary, black and white is a role-playing game

450
00:26:50,941 --> 00:26:52,623
where you play the role of a god.

451
00:26:52,623 --> 00:26:53,964
The world is what you make it.

452
00:26:53,964 --> 00:26:55,625
You nurture a creature.

453
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:01,002
into whatever you want him to be, an unspeakable killing machine

454
00:27:01,002 --> 00:27:03,183
or wonderfully benevolently kind creature.

455
00:27:03,183 --> 00:27:07,224
You play through a story which has a beginning, a middle and an end.

456
00:27:07,224 --> 00:27:12,186
Everything I'm going to show you today will be just features in the game.

457
00:27:12,186 --> 00:27:15,208
I'm not going to be able to show you the whole game, it'll just be features.

458
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:18,209
It may confuse you, but please always remember

459
00:27:18,209 --> 00:27:20,650
that you are playing through this interactive story

460
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:25,632
and making learning to play the game part of the game itself.

461
00:27:26,191 --> 00:27:28,473
I just don't think tutorials work.

462
00:27:28,473 --> 00:27:31,815
It's far better to say, to look at what console games do

463
00:27:31,815 --> 00:27:34,637
and make the learning part of it part of the game,

464
00:27:34,637 --> 00:27:36,919
part of the story, enabling you to,

465
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:38,480
you know, it takes pressure off you.

466
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,462
The last thing I want to do when I get a game home

467
00:27:41,462 --> 00:27:43,363
and unwrap it and put it in the drive

468
00:27:43,363 --> 00:27:45,305
is spend two hours learning to play it.

469
00:27:45,305 --> 00:27:46,786
It feels like going to school.

470
00:27:46,786 --> 00:27:48,427
It's far better if that's part of the story.

471
00:27:50,255 --> 00:27:53,957
So the last slide is when it's going to be finished.

472
00:27:53,957 --> 00:27:59,461
It'll be released, I hope, on the 23rd of September this year.

473
00:27:59,461 --> 00:28:02,884
There'll be three different versions.

474
00:28:02,884 --> 00:28:05,706
Black & White Tales, which is a single-player version,

475
00:28:05,706 --> 00:28:09,028
Black & White Gathering, which is the online chat program,

476
00:28:09,028 --> 00:28:11,610
which I'll talk about a little later,

477
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:14,612
and Black & White Worlds, which is the full-blown online side.

478
00:28:14,612 --> 00:28:18,075
And currently those are the formats it's going to.

479
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:23,951
Right, I've delayed long enough, so now it's time for me to show the game.

480
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:29,487
I'm very, very, very nervous about showing it, I have to say.

481
00:28:29,487 --> 00:28:37,213
The chances of it lasting to the end of this demo, to the end of this show, is, well, thousands and thousands to run.

482
00:28:37,213 --> 00:28:42,957
So, please remember this is a game that's still under development.

483
00:28:42,957 --> 00:28:48,200
A lot of the stuff, especially the speech, is still got to be done.

484
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:54,685
All the speech you're going to hear in the game now is done by members of the Lionhead team, and they don't know how to.

485
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:57,797
to talk at all.

486
00:28:57,797 --> 00:29:03,479
It sounds cheesy, it sounds horrible, but please forgive them.

487
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:06,321
The two assistants you're going to see are still scratched.

488
00:29:06,321 --> 00:29:08,902
So let me show you something of the world.

489
00:29:10,506 --> 00:29:16,232
For a start, you'll notice that it is completely free of icons.

490
00:29:16,232 --> 00:29:18,294
The only thing in the game is this hand.

491
00:29:18,294 --> 00:29:21,357
This hand enables you to move around freely.

492
00:29:21,357 --> 00:29:24,540
We've tried to do away with the keyboard completely.

493
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:29,165
I can move around in the world just by clicking and pulling the world around.

494
00:29:29,165 --> 00:29:33,589
Or I can point to places I want to go to and just double-click and move back.

495
00:29:34,771 --> 00:29:38,033
I can go and look at the world in incredible detail.

496
00:29:38,033 --> 00:29:40,575
For example, this is the...

497
00:29:40,575 --> 00:29:44,997
And incidentally, this is such a cheap trick, but everyone always comments on it.

498
00:29:44,997 --> 00:29:49,820
It took about two seconds to do this little trick that I showed you here.

499
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:53,382
I can go and look at the world in incredible detail.

500
00:29:53,382 --> 00:29:54,503
For example...

501
00:29:56,115 --> 00:30:05,999
This is a barrel with an apple on it, and in the apple you can see a worm,

502
00:30:05,999 --> 00:30:10,401
and I can pull back from that and look at the whole world.

503
00:30:10,401 --> 00:30:15,123
A persistent frame rate of 25 frames a second.

504
00:30:18,943 --> 00:30:22,704
You know, being inspired by the consoles is something that I've really tried to do here.

505
00:30:22,704 --> 00:30:28,866
Keep the framerate consistent. It absolutely relies upon that.

506
00:30:28,866 --> 00:30:37,068
And even when you do look a long way away, it will try and maintain that framerate.

507
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:40,969
Okay, so what can you do in this world? Well, let me tell you the first game rule.

508
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:47,710
The first game rule is you are a god, and as such, you can do anything. Anything you like.

509
00:30:48,274 --> 00:30:51,156
in the area that believes in you.

510
00:30:51,156 --> 00:30:55,639
And this red flash that is going across the land you see here

511
00:30:55,639 --> 00:31:00,223
denotes the area that actually believes in you at the moment.

512
00:31:00,223 --> 00:31:02,704
So I can, outside this area I can do nothing at all.

513
00:31:02,704 --> 00:31:05,346
I can't pick rocks up, I can't do anything.

514
00:31:05,346 --> 00:31:07,408
Inside this area I can do anything.

515
00:31:07,408 --> 00:31:13,972
So clearly one of the things I might want to do is pick this woman up.

516
00:31:15,218 --> 00:31:19,701
And I can just be, you know, I might need to teach these fellas a lesson.

517
00:31:19,701 --> 00:31:22,643
You know, I don't want them to be cheeky to me, I want them to believe in me,

518
00:31:22,643 --> 00:31:25,905
and maybe I want to make a world that is really horrible and evil.

519
00:31:25,905 --> 00:31:28,767
So let's just, uh, let's just chuck her around a little bit.

520
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:34,110
So there she is. Oh, she's still alive.

521
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:37,392
Let's see what happens if I pick up this rock,

522
00:31:37,392 --> 00:31:42,716
and I just, uh, sort of kind of just let this rock on top of her.

523
00:31:44,097 --> 00:31:50,446
You can do anything you like within the world. I can...

524
00:31:50,446 --> 00:31:52,609
I can start bowling, if I like.

525
00:31:52,609 --> 00:31:59,840
You can even...

526
00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:04,061
do cool things, you can be nice to people, you don't have to be nasty.

527
00:32:04,061 --> 00:32:07,984
I can pick up this woman here and I can take her over to this field.

528
00:32:07,984 --> 00:32:12,407
This is what I call the micro-management portion of the game. You don't have to do it,

529
00:32:12,407 --> 00:32:16,770
it's there, it's cool, if you do do it you'll find your villagers a little bit better,

530
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:21,293
but if you want to get on with the game and do something else you can do.

531
00:32:21,293 --> 00:32:24,235
So I can take this woman and just say to her,

532
00:32:24,235 --> 00:32:30,160
I want you to farm this field, so let's just gently drop her down.

533
00:32:31,028 --> 00:32:32,129
That was unfortunate.

534
00:32:32,129 --> 00:32:36,071
Yeah, I had her in my hand a little bit too long.

535
00:32:36,071 --> 00:32:36,391
Sorry about that.

536
00:32:36,391 --> 00:32:43,554
I suppose I shouldn't have been quite so vicious to her.

537
00:32:43,554 --> 00:32:44,695
Let's do that again, sorry.

538
00:32:44,695 --> 00:32:47,036
It is cool being nasty, honestly.

539
00:32:47,036 --> 00:32:50,918
Don't have to be awful.

540
00:32:50,918 --> 00:32:53,379
I've played some of them before.

541
00:32:53,379 --> 00:32:55,780
There we go, he made it.

542
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,761
He should now...

543
00:32:56,761 --> 00:32:58,081
They're all actually mourning.

544
00:32:58,081 --> 00:32:59,502
He is going to...

545
00:32:59,502 --> 00:33:00,182
They're all upset.

546
00:33:01,652 --> 00:33:05,657
by that. But they're getting back to it, I'll just take that distraction out of the way

547
00:33:05,657 --> 00:33:10,422
for them and that will be absolutely fine. So you can do that, you can do some cool things

548
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:17,970
maybe, this village needs some wood to build some more houses for you so that town becomes

549
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:23,636
bigger, there's more of them, they'll believe in you more. So you can even do things like

550
00:33:23,636 --> 00:33:23,876
I can...

551
00:33:25,177 --> 00:33:29,839
pick up trees and I can chuck trees around, I can drop trees down and you'll

552
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:36,522
notice the little villagers will actually start interacting with those

553
00:33:36,522 --> 00:33:42,745
trees and start self-chopping those trees up into firewood and enabling them to build more things.

554
00:33:42,905 --> 00:33:51,488
You know, it is an amazingly interactable place, you can do cool things like steal their food from one village and put it into another village.

555
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:57,411
Anything you want. That is the sandpit idea, the ants nest that I discovered as a kid.

556
00:33:57,411 --> 00:34:04,453
But where the game really, really comes into its own is when I introduce the creature.

557
00:34:04,453 --> 00:34:04,713
Now...

558
00:34:06,382 --> 00:34:08,184
The creature is...

559
00:34:08,184 --> 00:34:12,989
Actually, this is a bug. I have to tell you about this bug. It's quite amusing.

560
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:17,094
You can pick up a little person and put them down near a tree.

561
00:34:17,094 --> 00:34:19,356
And she should...

562
00:34:19,356 --> 00:34:27,125
This little person should now know that what I mean is for her to go and chop the tree down.

563
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:27,645
The unfortunate thing is...

564
00:34:28,812 --> 00:34:32,637
I forgot to tell her to get out of the way of the fallen trees.

565
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:36,081
So, quite often trees can fall on the people who chop them,

566
00:34:36,081 --> 00:34:39,466
which is a little detail of a bug that needs to be got over.

567
00:34:39,466 --> 00:34:42,049
So, let's just look at the creature side of it now.

568
00:34:42,049 --> 00:34:44,373
Incidentally, you'll notice that it's actually getting,

569
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:45,814
the weather is actually changing.

570
00:34:46,315 --> 00:34:50,658
I love playing, I love adding things into games.

571
00:34:50,658 --> 00:34:57,002
One of the cool things about Black & White is it's a fully, fully weather simulation.

572
00:34:57,002 --> 00:34:59,504
If you have this option on install, you can actually...

573
00:34:59,504 --> 00:35:02,526
Black & White, every time you play it, will go onto the web.

574
00:35:02,526 --> 00:35:05,448
It will go onto www.weathercities.com

575
00:35:05,448 --> 00:35:10,011
and download weather information about the city that you live in.

576
00:35:10,011 --> 00:35:15,455
And the weather you see in Black & White will be the same as the weather outside your window.

577
00:35:15,815 --> 00:35:16,996
which is quite cool.

578
00:35:16,996 --> 00:35:24,963
So let's introduce you to the creature.

579
00:35:28,307 --> 00:35:36,415
The idea is that in the first 15 minutes you discover these creatures and you have a choice

580
00:35:36,415 --> 00:35:39,237
of three creatures you can pick up and care for.

581
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:46,264
There is a lion, there is a cow and there is an ape.

582
00:35:46,264 --> 00:35:47,826
And it's up to you which one you pick.

583
00:35:47,826 --> 00:35:51,350
Once you pick one, that's your creature, you do have an opportunity to change it.

584
00:35:51,929 --> 00:35:56,853
So let's just show you one of those creatures. I'm going to cheat now. I haven't got time to play the story.

585
00:35:56,853 --> 00:36:02,077
And we'll just create an ape. And here he is. He's a little baby thing at the moment.

586
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:07,301
I'm actually going to cheat and make him a little bit bigger.

587
00:36:08,267 --> 00:36:14,611
He grows up, and as he grows up, he can get, by the end of the game, he can get absolutely huge.

588
00:36:14,611 --> 00:36:19,494
And you can see him comparatively, the comparative distance and scale to him.

589
00:36:19,494 --> 00:36:23,497
Now, the creature himself has, learns in different ways.

590
00:36:23,497 --> 00:36:27,159
And what I said is, you can teach him anything you like.

591
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:32,923
Absolutely anything, anything in the world you can teach him.

592
00:36:32,923 --> 00:36:34,204
I'll just bring him over here.

593
00:36:36,062 --> 00:36:42,423
And there is two distinct ways that your creature learns the first way was inspired by watching

594
00:36:42,423 --> 00:36:48,224
Watching children, and I just gonna put it on pause a second while I explain this point

595
00:36:48,224 --> 00:36:56,566
The cool thing about children or the very uncool thing about children depending which way you look at it is that children never stop learning

596
00:36:56,566 --> 00:37:03,027
Just because I turn around to a kid and say look. This is a lovely blue pen and

597
00:37:03,027 --> 00:37:04,807
They'll say blue pen blue pen

598
00:37:05,527 --> 00:37:10,708
And that teaches them a very strong lesson that this is called the blue pen.

599
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:14,370
If I then turn back and carry on watching the football game and say,

600
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:17,611
come on you bastards, score a goal,

601
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:20,532
then don't expect your kid to suddenly switch off learning.

602
00:37:20,932 --> 00:37:27,036
Expect, and indeed you will experience, the fact the next time you go down to the supermarket,

603
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,877
your kid will actually say,

604
00:37:28,877 --> 00:37:31,739
come on daddy you bastard, I want to get home.

605
00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:37,082
And that key thing, that key way of learning, was an inspiration for Black and White.

606
00:37:37,082 --> 00:37:39,263
Your creature watches you play the game.

607
00:37:39,263 --> 00:37:43,686
And every time you're mean, every time you're nasty, every time you do anything in the world,

608
00:37:43,686 --> 00:37:45,887
he is taking that as inspiration.

609
00:37:46,427 --> 00:37:49,730
That means he is a reflection of the way that you play the game.

610
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:53,553
That's the first way he learns, but more importantly what he learns,

611
00:37:53,553 --> 00:37:57,717
maybe more importantly, is your ability to say,

612
00:37:57,717 --> 00:37:59,158
that was good, that was bad.

613
00:37:59,158 --> 00:38:02,121
I showed him this object, he didn't do anything with him, I'm going to tell him off now.

614
00:38:02,121 --> 00:38:06,764
You tell him off just by clicking on him, holding down the mouse,

615
00:38:06,764 --> 00:38:10,668
and I'm just going to change it to daylight so you can see what's going on.

616
00:38:10,668 --> 00:38:12,870
And I'm now interacting with him.

617
00:38:13,609 --> 00:38:15,691
He's a bit cheeky and he's got to be told off.

618
00:38:15,691 --> 00:38:21,258
You tell him off by just by slapping him around a little bit.

619
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:25,523
If you really, really want to tell him off then, you know, just...

620
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:35,420
And that actually tells him bad, you know, bad.

621
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,562
It's like rolling up a newspaper and hitting a dog.

622
00:38:37,562 --> 00:38:39,503
I mean, it's, you know, it's a bad lesson.

623
00:38:39,503 --> 00:38:42,025
He's depressed now, and you've got to feel sorry for him.

624
00:38:42,025 --> 00:38:45,327
The other way is just moving the mouth slowly over him

625
00:38:45,327 --> 00:38:47,809
and just stroking him.

626
00:38:47,809 --> 00:38:50,151
And he really, really likes being stroked.

627
00:38:50,151 --> 00:38:53,053
He likes hands being run through his hair.

628
00:38:53,053 --> 00:38:55,394
He understands about all his body parts.

629
00:38:55,394 --> 00:38:58,236
You can stroke his tummy if he's got some, okay,

630
00:38:58,236 --> 00:39:00,578
you can tickle his feet.

631
00:39:00,578 --> 00:39:02,840
And for that extra special reward, of course,

632
00:39:03,221 --> 00:39:08,124
Roy from my side is one of the particular ones.

633
00:39:13,944 --> 00:39:18,668
So, you know, trying to make this real living creature is a real ambition.

634
00:39:18,668 --> 00:39:23,552
What I'm going to do now is, again, because we don't have the side,

635
00:39:23,552 --> 00:39:26,495
I really want to show off some of the things that Creatures can do.

636
00:39:26,495 --> 00:39:27,616
I'm going to bring up an editor.

637
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:30,638
What I'm going to show you now is not part of the game at all.

638
00:39:30,638 --> 00:39:34,882
It just allows me to activate cool features about the creature

639
00:39:34,882 --> 00:39:37,724
just to show you some of the things that happen during the game.

640
00:39:37,724 --> 00:39:42,448
So I'll activate that editor and load in one of another creature, which is a tiger.

641
00:39:43,507 --> 00:39:51,232
This creature, as I said, it starts off in the game as this tiny little thing,

642
00:39:51,232 --> 00:39:56,375
and as the game goes on he grows up until he ends up this huge mammoth thing.

643
00:39:56,375 --> 00:40:02,619
Now obviously, if you've made this huge creature and you've made him a caring, kind creature,

644
00:40:02,619 --> 00:40:06,482
then him walking through a village is a problem,

645
00:40:06,482 --> 00:40:10,424
because he'll end up squishing more little people than he will saving them.

646
00:40:11,141 --> 00:40:14,905
But not only does the creature change in size, but he actually morphs.

647
00:40:14,905 --> 00:40:18,068
He morphs in real time to reflect his state.

648
00:40:18,068 --> 00:40:20,910
For example, if you've encouraged him to eat a lot,

649
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:23,973
then he will start putting on weight.

650
00:40:23,973 --> 00:40:25,555
He'll end up really, really fat.

651
00:40:25,555 --> 00:40:26,876
Now, you're going to have to...

652
00:40:26,876 --> 00:40:28,878
What you can do with your creature, a cool thing is,

653
00:40:28,878 --> 00:40:31,220
while you're playing through the single-player game,

654
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,103
you can take your creature out of the single-player game,

655
00:40:34,103 --> 00:40:34,783
take him online...

656
00:40:35,772 --> 00:40:38,056
and meet other people's creatures.

657
00:40:38,056 --> 00:40:41,603
Now you're the one that has to justify why your creature is hugely overweight.

658
00:40:43,929 --> 00:40:48,012
or perhaps why your creature is completely underfed.

659
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:50,894
So your creature changes in size from what he eats,

660
00:40:50,894 --> 00:40:54,617
but he also changes in size, he's not part of the game,

661
00:40:54,617 --> 00:40:58,020
so that's why he walked through him, by the way.

662
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,942
He changes in size in terms of size and strength.

663
00:41:00,942 --> 00:41:03,604
Your creature can lift things up,

664
00:41:03,604 --> 00:41:04,985
he can do manual tasks for you,

665
00:41:04,985 --> 00:41:08,188
he can fight for you, the more he fights,

666
00:41:08,188 --> 00:41:11,050
the more muscles that he actually puts on.

667
00:41:11,922 --> 00:41:13,864
or any combination of those two.

668
00:41:13,864 --> 00:41:18,030
So he can be fat and thin, fat and strong,

669
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:21,194
or he can be fat and weak, any combination of those two.

670
00:41:21,194 --> 00:41:24,779
But most importantly, as you develop his personality,

671
00:41:25,503 --> 00:41:27,864
He visually changes.

672
00:41:27,864 --> 00:41:31,184
Now, clearly, the creature that I'm developing is going to be a hard bastard.

673
00:41:31,184 --> 00:41:33,025
He's not going to be someone who, uh...

674
00:41:33,025 --> 00:41:35,246
He's not going to be someone you mess with,

675
00:41:35,246 --> 00:41:38,447
and so, you know, he's going to be a little bit evil.

676
00:41:38,447 --> 00:41:44,868
So he will slowly change and morph to become more evil and vicious looking.

677
00:41:44,868 --> 00:41:47,249
Or, if you've decided to make him nice and caring,

678
00:41:47,249 --> 00:41:51,390
he'll change and morph and become more good and godly looking.

679
00:41:52,495 --> 00:41:57,378
And the sheer number of things that your creature can do is amazing.

680
00:41:57,378 --> 00:42:04,163
He has all the facial expressions that the human face can possibly make.

681
00:42:04,163 --> 00:42:13,329
He can smile, he can laugh, he can make all the lip motions, all the 44 phoneme motions that a human

682
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:16,831
voice can make and that enables you to take him online and chat with him

683
00:42:16,831 --> 00:42:21,894
and him actually mail the words you're either typing or saying across a microphone.

684
00:42:23,654 --> 00:42:25,875
You have to train him up in a variety of things.

685
00:42:25,875 --> 00:42:28,975
One of the things that you do have to train him up about,

686
00:42:28,975 --> 00:42:32,716
which I apologize for, but British people just love

687
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:36,457
anything to do with toilets and lavatory humor.

688
00:42:36,457 --> 00:42:40,518
And one of the things that you can teach him is

689
00:42:40,518 --> 00:42:42,699
where and when he can go to the toilet.

690
00:42:42,699 --> 00:42:47,360
So you can literally, and I apologize for this word,

691
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,061
but I can't think of any better one.

692
00:42:49,061 --> 00:42:52,062
You can literally train him to shit all over your opponent.

693
00:42:52,517 --> 00:42:54,137
You can absolutely do that.

694
00:42:54,137 --> 00:42:58,179
You can also train him to go to the toilet on fields.

695
00:42:58,179 --> 00:43:03,321
If he goes to the toilet on fields a lot, it will be used as fertilizers.

696
00:43:03,321 --> 00:43:06,282
You can persuade your little people to pick up the poo.

697
00:43:06,282 --> 00:43:11,624
It may make you feel a little bit nauseous to see all this poo moving around the world,

698
00:43:11,624 --> 00:43:13,785
but they will put it down on the fields.

699
00:43:13,785 --> 00:43:18,727
Just before the show we had this terrible, terrible bug with the AI where...

700
00:43:20,168 --> 00:43:23,510
Basically what was happening, the creatures got obsessed with their own...

701
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:29,552
their own feces and ended up learning to fight with them

702
00:43:29,552 --> 00:43:32,313
by picking them up and throwing them at each other

703
00:43:32,313 --> 00:43:33,653
which made me feel ill.

704
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:41,436
And I tell you, I am nervous about showing you the fighting in case this bug wasn't fixed

705
00:43:41,436 --> 00:43:45,577
because if that happens again, it just is, you know, it'll turn you off the whole...

706
00:43:45,577 --> 00:43:47,778
I'm going to have to get rid of...

707
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:54,334
my creature soon. But where the game really really comes into its own is the fighting system. What I

708
00:43:54,334 --> 00:44:01,340
wanted to do is create a fighting system that was as comprehensive as any fighting game you can get

709
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:08,706
on any system ever and enable you to teach and encourage your your creature to fight. So if I

710
00:44:08,706 --> 00:44:14,130
just uh if I just what I'm gonna do is set up a fight I'll just do one thing first. Yes goody two shoes.

711
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:16,071
Why are we always arguing? Because I hate you.

712
00:44:17,517 --> 00:44:24,262
What I'm going to do is, I'm not taking any chances there,

713
00:44:24,262 --> 00:44:28,525
is set up a fight between two creatures.

714
00:44:28,525 --> 00:44:33,169
And I'm going to set up a fight between the tiger and, surprisingly, the cow.

715
00:44:33,169 --> 00:44:36,491
You may think, I know what the outcome of this is going to be,

716
00:44:36,491 --> 00:44:37,652
that the tiger's going to win.

717
00:44:37,652 --> 00:44:41,555
Well, we spent a little time on the cow,

718
00:44:41,555 --> 00:44:45,198
and he's not the wimpy thing that you might have thought of.

719
00:44:52,295 --> 00:44:57,141
Right, here they go, they're just sizing each other up.

720
00:44:57,141 --> 00:44:59,023
Okay, come on cow.

721
00:44:59,023 --> 00:45:07,733
And what you'll notice is, as they fight, we have this very, very cool...

722
00:45:09,026 --> 00:45:14,813
persistent damage going in on the creatures.

723
00:45:14,813 --> 00:45:21,501
You can just see down there the cow has been hit on the belly.

724
00:45:21,501 --> 00:45:25,146
You can just see that a bruise is starting to develop.

725
00:45:37,193 --> 00:45:40,256
Oh, and you see the cow special, it is quite cool.

726
00:45:40,256 --> 00:45:43,318
Anyway, a bruise is starting to develop where he's been hit.

727
00:45:43,318 --> 00:45:48,943
Now, that damage that is done by the lion is persistent.

728
00:45:48,943 --> 00:45:53,826
In other words, it will heal over time and the scar will remain.

729
00:45:53,826 --> 00:45:57,589
That means that your creatures are completely unique.

730
00:45:57,589 --> 00:45:58,750
When you're...

731
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:04,594
He's starting to climb and you see another creature and he's walking over the hill.

732
00:46:04,594 --> 00:46:07,256
He looks hunched and mean and vicious.

733
00:46:07,256 --> 00:46:10,819
You know exactly what the play is like.

734
00:46:10,819 --> 00:46:15,482
I just need to change the odds because my technique is getting mashed up here.

735
00:46:15,482 --> 00:46:22,226
What I'm going to do is just make the tiger a little bit more evil.

736
00:46:22,226 --> 00:46:26,289
And also just make the beast a little bit in the tiger's favour.

737
00:46:26,289 --> 00:46:27,010
Just a little bit.

738
00:46:29,197 --> 00:46:36,982
Yeah, that's better. I mean I could have... I could have done...

739
00:46:36,982 --> 00:46:44,346
Okay, okay, we'll change it back again.

740
00:46:44,346 --> 00:46:51,050
So, the creatures are incredibly cool things. There's one more thing...

741
00:47:00,656 --> 00:47:04,718
There's one more thing I've got to show about the creature, but it is nightfall.

742
00:47:04,718 --> 00:47:11,001
And this cool thing, this moon that's going up here, is what the moon will be like outside this hall tonight.

743
00:47:11,001 --> 00:47:14,142
You know, trying to make it as real as possible.

744
00:47:14,142 --> 00:47:25,388
One last thing, one last trick with the creature. There's loads and loads of stuff which I haven't really shown.

745
00:47:25,388 --> 00:47:26,988
I'll show a different creature.

746
00:47:26,988 --> 00:47:27,389
This is the wolf.

747
00:47:27,389 --> 00:47:29,610
It walks in quite a cool way.

748
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:38,031
One last thing I didn't share with the creature is some of the individual stuff that he does.

749
00:47:38,031 --> 00:47:40,552
He can get happy, he can get cold, he can get hot.

750
00:47:40,552 --> 00:47:47,574
If you do decide to take your creature online, what we will be doing is introducing colds

751
00:47:47,574 --> 00:47:50,315
and flu to the online, when you're online.

752
00:47:50,315 --> 00:47:55,397
So if your creature's been going around with other creatures,

753
00:47:55,397 --> 00:47:58,118
he can actually catch a cold from those other creatures.

754
00:47:59,095 --> 00:48:04,897
The other cool thing is that you will notice that your creature, if you are playing a CD in the drive,

755
00:48:04,897 --> 00:48:08,719
you can play any music CD you like while playing Black and White or any MP3,

756
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:13,900
you will notice that after a while your creature will start tapping his foot.

757
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:19,242
And you'll further notice that after a little longer he will learn to dance in perfect time to...

758
00:48:19,242 --> 00:48:24,924
he'll learn to dance in perfect time to the CD you're listening to.

759
00:48:33,847 --> 00:48:38,452
Now, that means what we are actually doing is we're going to www.tunes.com,

760
00:48:38,452 --> 00:48:43,116
downloading information on the music track, finding out what the type of music is,

761
00:48:43,116 --> 00:48:47,841
and so your creature will learn to breakdance. If you can imagine what it's like going online

762
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:53,146
with your creature who is just an expert at breakdancing and showing them off to everyone else,

763
00:48:53,146 --> 00:48:55,468
it's ultimately cool.

764
00:48:59,112 --> 00:49:05,635
So enough about the creature, I'll show you a bit more about the creature a little bit later on.

765
00:49:05,635 --> 00:49:10,697
What I'd like to show you now is something to do with the magic system.

766
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:18,460
The idea of the magic system is that you need little people to pray and worship you.

767
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,141
to enable you to to

768
00:49:20,141 --> 00:49:24,945
Utilize the magic and that's what this thing is here rather strangely

769
00:49:24,945 --> 00:49:32,090
They built it in your honor and what you can do is you can move this up and tell them right?

770
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:35,312
It's time that you all came and started worshipping me

771
00:49:35,312 --> 00:49:39,055
And they're all starting to run towards the citadel

772
00:49:40,217 --> 00:49:42,438
And when they get there, they'll start crying.

773
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:46,700
Now, what I'm going to show you now is the inside of the Citadel,

774
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,921
which is extremely important.

775
00:49:48,921 --> 00:49:51,983
It allows you to look at certain things within the world.

776
00:49:51,983 --> 00:49:58,266
And this is showing off some of our new engine technology,

777
00:49:58,266 --> 00:50:00,627
which I haven't shown before, but it's quite cool.

778
00:50:01,953 --> 00:50:10,735
This is the inside of the Citadel, this is our new 3D engine, it has real-time ray tracing and a thing called Real Materials.

779
00:50:10,735 --> 00:50:16,817
If you look at this bronze statue here, you can see the light sourcing, reflecting off the bronze statue.

780
00:50:16,817 --> 00:50:24,960
You can see all the reflections on the floor, all the lighting effects that are going on.

781
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:30,341
I think it's really cool and it's going to enable us to do some amazing things with our next game.

782
00:50:31,665 --> 00:50:38,717
What is inside the citadel are different rooms. There is a room for your creature, there's a room for the story...

783
00:50:39,397 --> 00:50:42,338
and these rooms have different pictures in.

784
00:50:42,338 --> 00:50:47,441
You can do an incredibly cool thing with these pictures.

785
00:50:47,441 --> 00:50:54,303
If it's a story, if it's an element, a part of the story that you've completed, a challenge,

786
00:50:54,303 --> 00:50:57,425
what you can do is you can go up to one of these pictures

787
00:50:57,425 --> 00:50:59,926
and click on the picture and think to yourself,

788
00:50:59,926 --> 00:51:01,767
I didn't like the way I did that challenge.

789
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,247
I really didn't, you know, I thought...

790
00:51:03,707 --> 00:51:08,450
it wasn't right. You can click on that challenge, the game will allow you to do that challenge again

791
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:15,653
and then it will fast forward all the effects that the difference that you made in that challenge would have taken.

792
00:51:15,653 --> 00:51:23,877
It's like going back in time, making a little tiny change and then going forward in time again and seeing what that change does.

793
00:51:23,877 --> 00:51:26,898
I think it enables people to absolutely get things right.

794
00:51:28,277 --> 00:51:34,021
You know the citadel is there designed to be a really beautiful really really beautiful beautiful place

795
00:51:34,021 --> 00:51:38,203
Okay, let's have a look at some of the things. I don't like it. I do

796
00:51:38,203 --> 00:51:45,909
The what I'm going to do is ask me my little people here all chanting away

797
00:51:45,909 --> 00:51:49,291
I'm going to ask them to pray for a fireball

798
00:51:51,524 --> 00:51:52,866
And that charges up the fireballs.

799
00:51:52,866 --> 00:51:55,108
Where would faith be without fireballs?

800
00:51:55,108 --> 00:51:56,990
Now we're getting into bad voiceover stuff now.

801
00:51:56,990 --> 00:52:00,033
Use them wisely. You are using the prayers of your people.

802
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:02,976
And what I can do with these fireballs is I can throw them.

803
00:52:02,976 --> 00:52:08,821
So I'm going to now throw this across the landscape and you can see that it just shoots across the landscape.

804
00:52:08,821 --> 00:52:14,347
What I've tried to do with this is try and make this as intuitive as possible.

805
00:52:14,347 --> 00:52:15,328
I'm just going to cheat now.

806
00:52:16,118 --> 00:52:17,919
give myself free access to the spells.

807
00:52:17,919 --> 00:52:19,940
Try and make this as intuitive as possible.

808
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:24,002
Also, allow you to get good at casting magic.

809
00:52:24,002 --> 00:52:26,043
So you can do some cool stuff with it.

810
00:52:26,043 --> 00:52:27,904
For example, I can throw a fireball

811
00:52:27,904 --> 00:52:31,205
and just give it a little tiny bit of aftertouch,

812
00:52:31,205 --> 00:52:32,906
just like you do in a football game.

813
00:52:32,906 --> 00:52:33,986
Just a little bit of aftertouch

814
00:52:33,986 --> 00:52:36,528
and you can curl it round mountains.

815
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:37,888
If we're playing a multiplayer game,

816
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:40,870
I can start bombarding your places with fireballs.

817
00:52:41,557 --> 00:52:47,101
The other thing that you can do is, using the gesture technology,

818
00:52:47,101 --> 00:52:50,843
I can just paint on the landscape a symbol.

819
00:52:50,843 --> 00:52:54,146
And this symbol powers up the fireball.

820
00:52:54,146 --> 00:53:01,691
So if I cast it now, you can see that it actually turns into three fireballs.

821
00:53:01,691 --> 00:53:05,033
Some of those gestures can be really complex.

822
00:53:05,033 --> 00:53:09,617
For example, I can do a gesture like this, which is a pentagram,

823
00:53:09,617 --> 00:53:11,318
which really powers up the fireball.

824
00:53:11,924 --> 00:53:19,570
It just allows it to be a really explosive fireball.

825
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:26,015
The other thing is that these gestures are really flexible.

826
00:53:26,015 --> 00:53:30,499
I must warn you now, if anybody of you plays me at multiplayer, one of the gestures in

827
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:36,063
the game is my signature, which is the ultimate cheat for me, which allows me to cheat with

828
00:53:36,063 --> 00:53:36,964
everybody else.

829
00:53:37,666 --> 00:53:42,991
The spells are not only destructive, there are creative spells.

830
00:53:42,991 --> 00:53:48,076
This is a storm spell, which allows me to create a storm.

831
00:53:48,076 --> 00:53:53,861
Again, I just paint down on the landscape the area of which I want the storm to cover.

832
00:53:53,861 --> 00:53:57,505
And if you have a look, it'll actually start raining now.

833
00:53:59,326 --> 00:54:04,707
You can then push that storm across the landscape towards somebody else.

834
00:54:04,707 --> 00:54:10,088
Again, trying to make things as realistic as you possibly can.

835
00:54:10,088 --> 00:54:17,229
There are spells which allow you to create things.

836
00:54:17,229 --> 00:54:20,010
For example, I can click on this.

837
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:22,750
Maybe my villagers have run out of wood.

838
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:26,851
What I'll do is just create a magic forest.

839
00:54:27,469 --> 00:54:30,751
And I apologize that the woman hasn't got any clothes on.

840
00:54:30,751 --> 00:54:31,331
But she should do.

841
00:54:31,331 --> 00:54:36,173
She'll go out and create a magic forest for you to...

842
00:54:36,173 --> 00:54:39,274
for the little people to shop down the road.

843
00:54:39,274 --> 00:54:49,018
There's also...

844
00:54:49,018 --> 00:54:53,560
One second.

845
00:54:55,696 --> 00:55:00,798
There's also the ability to cast magic on your creature.

846
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:03,499
For example, if I have a creature,

847
00:55:03,499 --> 00:55:05,060
I can cast a magic spell on him.

848
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:08,782
I may want to send him out of my territory.

849
00:55:08,782 --> 00:55:12,883
I may want him to try and persuade other villagers

850
00:55:12,883 --> 00:55:15,064
to come across to my cause.

851
00:55:15,064 --> 00:55:19,786
And so one of the spells that is extremely useful for that

852
00:55:19,786 --> 00:55:21,267
is the crash spell.

853
00:55:22,617 --> 00:55:27,907
Sorry about this, one second.

854
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:30,312
I told you it'd crash. It's a miracle it's lasted this long.

855
00:55:30,312 --> 00:55:32,376
Let's just quickly go back in.

856
00:55:32,614 --> 00:55:36,956
Yeah, you can... What you can do is you can cast magic on your creature,

857
00:55:36,956 --> 00:55:41,177
but very coolly, any of the spells that you've seen me cast,

858
00:55:41,177 --> 00:55:43,018
you can teach your creature any of those spells.

859
00:55:43,018 --> 00:55:46,059
That means when one creature meets another creature,

860
00:55:46,059 --> 00:55:48,180
instead of fighting out hand to hand,

861
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:52,641
they can actually have this incredibly cool battle of magic.

862
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:58,063
I mean, just this immensely cool battle of magic that's there.

863
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:00,824
So, that's very cool. I'll just go forward.

864
00:56:03,303 --> 00:56:15,107
and just very quickly create a creature and show you a couple of their friends.

865
00:56:15,107 --> 00:56:20,788
I'm just completely cheating now.

866
00:56:20,788 --> 00:56:26,510
Just find the right spell.

867
00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:30,831
One second.

868
00:56:31,529 --> 00:56:40,276
I'll let the creature entertain you while I do this.

869
00:56:40,276 --> 00:56:43,679
Right, this is the invisibility spell.

870
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:48,143
If I cast it on my creature, then it pours a potion over the top of him

871
00:56:48,143 --> 00:56:53,548
and he'll slowly go invisible and, of course, while he's asleep, which is useful.

872
00:56:53,548 --> 00:56:57,311
And the only thing that doesn't go invisible are his eyes.

873
00:56:58,092 --> 00:57:06,580
So you can still see his eyes, so if I just start slapping him around you can still see his eyes there.

874
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:14,467
You can turn creatures to stone, if I just show you my creature actually casting a spell,

875
00:57:14,467 --> 00:57:16,449
all I'm going to do is...

876
00:57:16,449 --> 00:57:20,072
That was a mistake.

877
00:57:34,629 --> 00:57:36,570
Sorry about that, it's just a little weight.

878
00:57:36,570 --> 00:57:40,913
What I'm going to do is I'm going to force my creature to cast a spell.

879
00:57:40,913 --> 00:57:47,897
For example, I'll force him to cast the fireball spell that you just saw against this creature

880
00:57:47,897 --> 00:57:48,197
here.

881
00:57:48,197 --> 00:57:53,680
Now you notice that he is actually casting, doing the same gesture that I actually used

882
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,662
earlier and he's going to cast that against me.

883
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,882
four unsuspecting tigerns there.

884
00:57:58,882 --> 00:58:03,285
So your creatures, there is no limit to the,

885
00:58:03,285 --> 00:58:06,647
yeah, look at the smile on his face after that.

886
00:58:06,647 --> 00:58:10,470
There is absolutely no limit to the amount

887
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:12,372
that your creature can learn.

888
00:58:12,372 --> 00:58:16,275
Now we're running a little bit out of time at the moment,

889
00:58:16,275 --> 00:58:17,856
but what I'd like to do is show you

890
00:58:17,856 --> 00:58:22,660
some of the story stuff in the game now.

891
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:22,720
Now.

892
00:58:24,128 --> 00:58:27,730
The idea of the story stuff is that you have these two advisors.

893
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:30,571
You've seen them pop up occasionally.

894
00:58:30,571 --> 00:58:34,032
They're like the Hollywood angel and devil on your shoulder.

895
00:58:34,032 --> 00:58:37,614
There's the angel that's always trying to get you to do good stuff.

896
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:39,334
She's always trying to get you to be nice and kind.

897
00:58:39,334 --> 00:58:45,077
And there's a devil that just wants you to be mean and cruel and nasty.

898
00:58:45,077 --> 00:58:49,418
And as you play the game, they are listening out for prayers.

899
00:58:49,818 --> 00:58:51,779
The woman inside this house is praying to you for help.

900
00:58:51,779 --> 00:58:54,060
Prayers of the little people.

901
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:57,161
And you can choose to activate those prayers or not.

902
00:58:57,161 --> 00:59:04,164
And it's essentially these challenges which enable you to progress through the story.

903
00:59:04,164 --> 00:59:07,045
So I'll kick off one of these challenges.

904
00:59:07,045 --> 00:59:10,526
The speech you're going to hear there is very, very cheesy.

905
00:59:10,526 --> 00:59:14,407
I apologize for it, but it gives you an example.

906
00:59:14,407 --> 00:59:18,028
Oh Great One, I kneel before you.

907
00:59:19,643 --> 00:59:25,348
My brother Tarvis in a fever has left his sickbed and wandered into the forest where he must be lost.

908
00:59:25,348 --> 00:59:26,810
He is so weak I fear for his life.

909
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:30,453
Hear my pleas for help, I beg you.

910
00:59:30,453 --> 00:59:39,021
Help this woman and her poor brother and you will surely reap the benefits.

911
00:59:39,404 --> 00:59:41,204
She has put her faith in you.

912
00:59:41,204 --> 00:59:43,065
You can't run around after these people.

913
00:59:43,065 --> 00:59:44,206
They have to live their own lives.

914
00:59:44,206 --> 00:59:47,168
If you want them to respect you as a god,

915
00:59:47,168 --> 00:59:48,608
carry out an act of a god.

916
00:59:48,608 --> 00:59:50,609
Kill one of them.

917
00:59:50,609 --> 00:59:51,790
Right.

918
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:53,411
Well, what shall I do?

919
00:59:53,411 --> 00:59:55,312
How evil or how good shall I be?

920
00:59:55,312 --> 00:59:57,133
Well, clearly for this demonstration,

921
00:59:57,133 --> 00:59:59,154
it seems evil is good, so I'll be evil.

922
00:59:59,154 --> 01:00:00,975
Now, I could be a little bit evil.

923
01:00:00,975 --> 01:00:02,516
I could perhaps just ignore this.

924
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:04,416
I could perhaps go to the brother

925
01:00:04,416 --> 01:00:05,597
and pick him up and kill him.

926
01:00:06,367 --> 01:00:09,449
But I could be hugely evil if I liked.

927
01:00:09,449 --> 01:00:14,614
And the hugely evil answer to this is to pick up a woman,

928
01:00:14,614 --> 01:00:26,565
to kill her in any way you see fit, basically.

929
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:33,641
pick her up and to put her by her dead brother.

930
01:00:33,641 --> 01:00:35,822
So, by her close to death brother.

931
01:00:35,822 --> 01:00:42,843
That means what you're doing is killing the woman that prayed to you in the first place,

932
01:00:42,843 --> 01:00:46,224
killing her off and then dropping her by the...

933
01:00:46,224 --> 01:00:47,405
Oh, there we go.

934
01:00:47,405 --> 01:00:49,345
I'll just do that one more time.

935
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:52,786
Just... because there's one little tiny bug with it.

936
01:00:56,941 --> 01:00:59,924
The woman inside this house is praying to you for help.

937
01:00:59,924 --> 01:01:02,806
Right, if I just activate that again.

938
01:01:02,806 --> 01:01:05,688
So you choose how you solve this challenge.

939
01:01:05,688 --> 01:01:09,452
Do you want to be kind and nice?

940
01:01:09,452 --> 01:01:11,613
Or do you want to be evil and nasty?

941
01:01:11,613 --> 01:01:16,317
And that is the whole key to the way that this story actually unfolds.

942
01:01:16,317 --> 01:01:20,601
He is so weak. I fear for his life.

943
01:01:20,601 --> 01:01:24,224
Hear my pleas for help. I beg you.

944
01:01:24,224 --> 01:01:24,324
Right.

945
01:01:25,174 --> 01:01:28,676
Help this woman and her poor brother and you will surely be benefited.

946
01:01:28,676 --> 01:01:30,798
I could send my creature to help me do this as well.

947
01:01:30,798 --> 01:01:31,478
She has put a faith in you.

948
01:01:31,478 --> 01:01:33,840
You can't run around after these people.

949
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:37,242
They have to live their own lives.

950
01:01:37,242 --> 01:01:39,143
So if I pick her up now.

951
01:01:39,143 --> 01:01:43,667
If you want them to respect you as a god, carry out an act of a god.

952
01:01:43,667 --> 01:01:44,487
Kill one of them.

953
01:01:44,487 --> 01:01:47,429
So I'm just going to pick her up.

954
01:01:47,429 --> 01:01:51,172
And just throw her around a bit.

955
01:01:51,172 --> 01:01:53,813
That's not too far now.

956
01:01:53,813 --> 01:01:54,754
So there she is.

957
01:01:56,321 --> 01:01:59,663
So I'll pick her up now and I'll take her to...

958
01:01:59,663 --> 01:02:02,524
That'll teach her to meddle with nature.

959
01:02:02,524 --> 01:02:06,867
But it's terrible! We can't run a religion like this.

960
01:02:06,867 --> 01:02:13,050
So I'll just take her to the forest where her lost brother is.

961
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:18,513
And just drop her down next to her brother.

962
01:02:23,048 --> 01:02:26,450
My sister, dead? How can this be?

963
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:26,510
Oh!

964
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:30,892
Now, that was a pretty evil thing to do.

965
01:02:30,892 --> 01:02:33,053
Equally, I could have gone in and I could...

966
01:02:33,053 --> 01:02:35,394
Of course, my creature's just seen this

967
01:02:35,394 --> 01:02:38,275
and he's realised that, you know, I've been pretty evil and vicious.

968
01:02:38,275 --> 01:02:42,958
He's gonna learn something from that, from that side of it.

969
01:02:42,958 --> 01:02:44,878
And for that, you get a little reward.

970
01:02:44,878 --> 01:02:46,699
You get an extra... An extra spell.

971
01:02:48,212 --> 01:02:55,678
So that's essentially Black and White. I could show you, I could talk about it all night,

972
01:02:55,678 --> 01:03:00,762
and I'd love to talk about it all night, but maybe if we have enough time,

973
01:03:00,762 --> 01:03:08,228
if anybody's got any very quick questions they want to ask whilst I leave the game in

974
01:03:08,228 --> 01:03:11,771
the creature's capable hands. Does anyone have any questions?

975
01:03:13,643 --> 01:03:14,224
Nobody?

976
01:03:14,224 --> 01:03:16,545
A stranger has been seen putting the children into trances.

977
01:03:16,545 --> 01:03:17,126
Yes, we've got one person.

978
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:19,147
He has him imprisoned in his secret hideaway.

979
01:03:19,147 --> 01:03:19,707
Thank you.

980
01:03:19,707 --> 01:03:20,108
Thank you.

981
01:03:20,108 --> 01:03:20,348
Thank you.

982
01:03:20,348 --> 01:03:33,016
Thank you.

983
01:03:33,016 --> 01:03:36,878
Thank you.

984
01:03:36,878 --> 01:03:37,739
Thank you.

985
01:03:37,739 --> 01:03:38,019
Thank you.

986
01:03:38,019 --> 01:03:38,440
Thank you.

987
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:38,600
Thank you.

988
01:03:39,303 --> 01:03:41,744
It looks like a wonderful game, Peter. Thanks for showing it to us.

989
01:03:41,744 --> 01:03:48,347
I was wondering if you saw the recent remake of Populous, and if so, what you thought of it.

Populous, the beginning. I thought it was a very, very beautiful game.

991
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:59,093
They did a fantastic job. I know the person who developed it. I respect him an awful lot.

992
01:03:59,093 --> 01:04:05,936
I still think that the idea of Populous being a very, very simple game was a very compulsive one.

993
01:04:06,682 --> 01:04:07,442
Any other questions?

994
01:04:07,442 --> 01:04:09,104
Actually, we're running awfully late.

995
01:04:09,104 --> 01:04:10,565
Maybe we should hold the questions.

996
01:04:10,565 --> 01:04:12,207
Thank you very much indeed.

997
01:04:12,207 --> 01:04:26,301
Thank you very much indeed.
