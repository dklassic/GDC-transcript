1
00:00:04,368 --> 00:00:11,597
Yeah, thankfully they understand that a lot of us are game developers and we don't expect

2
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:15,381
to do anything before 10am, so a nice late morning start.

3
00:00:15,401 --> 00:00:19,907
So we're going to be talking about building VR communities, asymmetry, asynchrony and

4
00:00:19,927 --> 00:00:20,187
abuse.

5
00:00:20,227 --> 00:00:22,630
I'm sure it was the alliteration that drew you all to this talk.

6
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:25,994
Or maybe just the confusion about what the heck are you going to be talking about.

7
00:00:26,755 --> 00:00:27,416
My name is Rob.

8
00:00:27,896 --> 00:00:31,200
I am currently the manager for Google Earth VR.

9
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,082
It's with a company called Google.

10
00:00:33,103 --> 00:00:33,723
You might have heard of it.

11
00:00:33,823 --> 00:00:38,309
We do some search stuff and some crazy stuff on a team called Daydream.

12
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,432
Previously, I worked with Daydream Labs.

13
00:00:41,452 --> 00:00:46,637
So if you've seen me speak at VRDC before, or GDC, it was probably my work on Daydream

14
00:00:46,657 --> 00:00:47,898
Labs that I was up here talking about.

15
00:00:48,018 --> 00:00:52,782
So during my time there, I think we did about 120 different crazy little VR prototypes one

16
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:53,403
week at a time.

17
00:00:53,443 --> 00:00:54,784
I think that team is now up to about 160, 170 prototypes.

18
00:00:56,686 --> 00:01:00,908
And before Google, about two and a half years ago, I spent eight years running a small game

19
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:05,029
studio called Lazy 8 Studios. We did a really cool game called Cogs that you might have

20
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:09,831
heard of, a really cool game called Extrasolar that you probably haven't heard of, but you

21
00:01:09,851 --> 00:01:12,993
should play anyway because it's really cool and I'm going to have to discontinue it soon

22
00:01:13,013 --> 00:01:17,295
because it's way too expensive to run. We're going to be talking today about basically

23
00:01:17,335 --> 00:01:23,197
design considerations for VR and AR applications. So let's dig into this. What am I talking

24
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:24,938
about when I'm talking about design considerations?

25
00:01:26,191 --> 00:01:29,892
Let's take a trip into the future 10 years from now

26
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,694
and look back at this era in VR development

27
00:01:32,774 --> 00:01:34,954
from that perspective and see what we see.

28
00:01:37,115 --> 00:01:39,316
We have this huge number of dimensions

29
00:01:39,336 --> 00:01:40,137
that we can develop in.

30
00:01:40,197 --> 00:01:43,118
So you can think about solo versus multiplayer experiences,

31
00:01:43,778 --> 00:01:45,959
entertainment experiences, educational experiences,

32
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,279
functional experiences like tools,

33
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,700
cooperative versus adversarial,

34
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:52,141
consumer versus enterprise applications.

35
00:01:52,762 --> 00:01:57,686
In my mind, when I look at these categories, what I see is this huge multidimensional space

36
00:01:58,126 --> 00:02:04,732
of various experiences that can exist in VR and AR, and we have explored almost none of that area.

37
00:02:04,972 --> 00:02:08,115
Like, if you take the cross product of all of these different categories,

38
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:11,157
our explorations are so small right now.

39
00:02:12,411 --> 00:02:13,471
So what do we do about this?

40
00:02:13,651 --> 00:02:14,872
We're gonna look back in 10 years

41
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,572
and we're gonna be like,

42
00:02:15,872 --> 00:02:19,813
oh my god, how did no one even see genre X coming?

43
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,953
There are entire genres of games

44
00:02:21,973 --> 00:02:23,313
that we have not imagined yet.

45
00:02:24,534 --> 00:02:26,474
But specifically for this talk,

46
00:02:26,634 --> 00:02:28,895
I wanna talk about three of these attributes

47
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:31,395
that I think are not getting enough discussion right now.

48
00:02:32,395 --> 00:02:35,356
Asymmetric experiences, asynchronous experiences,

49
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:36,836
and dealing with abuse,

50
00:02:37,096 --> 00:02:39,197
and abuse especially for embodied avatars

51
00:02:39,257 --> 00:02:40,657
in VR to VR experiences.

52
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:46,350
So we're going to dig into all of these in detail, but let me first of all roll back

53
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:51,074
a little bit more to the familiar experiences that we all know and love, VR to VR experiences.

54
00:02:51,114 --> 00:02:56,658
You've got two players with compatible hardware, you know, six-off headsets, you've got head

55
00:02:56,699 --> 00:02:57,199
and hands.

56
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,902
This is like, this is an amazing space in VR.

57
00:03:01,102 --> 00:03:03,984
This absolutely represents the future unquestionably.

58
00:03:04,465 --> 00:03:05,506
And it's just a ton of fun.

59
00:03:05,546 --> 00:03:07,227
So I'm going to show just a few examples here.

60
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:10,769
This one is from a Tilt Brush prototype we put together.

61
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,051
Not officially launched yet, but we've shared this a little

62
00:03:13,071 --> 00:03:16,754
bit, representing here the explosion, the volcanic

63
00:03:16,814 --> 00:03:18,955
explosion of possibilities in virtual reality.

64
00:03:19,756 --> 00:03:21,657
This is one of those little experiments that we did with

65
00:03:21,677 --> 00:03:22,358
Daydream Labs.

66
00:03:22,538 --> 00:03:26,100
So we've got a couple players in a space together working on a

67
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,261
shared interface, which was specifically what we were

68
00:03:28,281 --> 00:03:31,122
looking at here, how that would work, doing some educational

69
00:03:31,162 --> 00:03:31,703
stuff together.

70
00:03:31,783 --> 00:03:33,884
So they're solving some physics problems together.

71
00:03:34,644 --> 00:03:39,347
We've talked at Google I O about YouTube.

72
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:40,547
So we have a Co-Presence YouTube

73
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:41,408
application on the way.

74
00:03:41,428 --> 00:03:43,309
It's a little bit different form of Co-Presence.

75
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:45,830
So your friends appear on kind of a doc space in front of you

76
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,751
and you can interact with them.

77
00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:51,945
We've got Rec Room. I think everybody here has probably spent a little bit of time in Rec Room.

78
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:58,311
This is a great multiplayer experience. The other day I went into the Wave VR. This is kind of one of the newer co-presence applications.

79
00:03:58,331 --> 00:04:03,174
It's like this virtual rave, really beautiful experience, different every time you go into it.

80
00:04:03,955 --> 00:04:06,577
But in this particular case, when I went into the Wave VR,

81
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,100
I was the only person there.

82
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,521
And that's kind of expected.

83
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:13,302
The way that the Wave deals with

84
00:04:14,062 --> 00:04:15,543
this kind of the slow emergence,

85
00:04:15,563 --> 00:04:17,885
the slow growth of VR and VR communities

86
00:04:18,165 --> 00:04:19,986
is that they schedule times

87
00:04:20,006 --> 00:04:21,908
that people come in together and rave together,

88
00:04:22,268 --> 00:04:23,749
which depending on what time zone you're on

89
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:25,710
may work well or may not work very well.

90
00:04:26,491 --> 00:04:28,052
So it's a beautiful event.

91
00:04:28,072 --> 00:04:30,613
This is definitely the future of VR to VR.

92
00:04:31,214 --> 00:04:31,974
But at the same time,

93
00:04:31,994 --> 00:04:34,996
this need to schedule events indicates a limitation.

94
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:41,282
How can we get around these limitations? So specifically let's think about like with VR to

95
00:04:41,302 --> 00:04:47,368
VR experiences, what's the probability that your close friend also has a VR headset that's

96
00:04:47,388 --> 00:04:52,133
compatible with yours? They've purchased the same application. They're online right now in

97
00:04:52,153 --> 00:04:55,516
the same application that you're in. It's basically zero.

98
00:04:55,897 --> 00:04:59,559
So when we talk about VR to VR experiences, we're going to fill out this chart over time.

99
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:04,382
When we talk about VR to VR experiences, we know that's the future. It's really cool. It's

100
00:05:04,462 --> 00:05:08,865
really engaging. You feel like you're there with your friends. But the audience right now is

101
00:05:09,305 --> 00:05:12,867
basically zero friends and a few strangers. How are we going to fix this?

102
00:05:13,761 --> 00:05:17,382
So let me put out a kind of a bold statement out there that I want to toss around for the

103
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:23,804
duration of this talk. The most inviting VR applications are going to be the ones that

104
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:29,526
understand how to engage those who aren't in VR. So one more time, the most inviting

105
00:05:29,566 --> 00:05:34,967
VR apps are going to be the ones who understand how to engage those who aren't in VR. So why

106
00:05:35,027 --> 00:05:40,369
is this important? There just aren't that many people in VR. So let's get back to those

107
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:45,012
criteria that I brought up previously, asymmetry,

108
00:05:45,032 --> 00:05:48,534
asynchrony, and abuse, and sort of express this

109
00:05:48,594 --> 00:05:49,794
as a series of lenses.

110
00:05:50,755 --> 00:05:53,696
So the first lens is, how can I engage a larger audience

111
00:05:53,816 --> 00:05:55,677
by making this experience asymmetric?

112
00:05:56,478 --> 00:05:57,859
And Daniel's gonna get up here later

113
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:00,440
and talk about this in a lot more detail.

114
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,682
The second lens is, how can I build an audience

115
00:06:03,922 --> 00:06:06,243
by considering different modalities of engagement?

116
00:06:06,423 --> 00:06:08,304
And this is, like, this one didn't fit into our,

117
00:06:10,565 --> 00:06:16,608
This is closely coupled with that first design lens. So when we talk about asymmetry, we're

118
00:06:16,628 --> 00:06:20,911
going to talk a lot about modalities of engagement. The third one is what's the benefit of allowing

119
00:06:20,971 --> 00:06:26,634
my users to engage with an experience asynchronously over time. And finally, how is your application

120
00:06:26,654 --> 00:06:29,896
going to handle abuse? Sai is going to get up here and talk extensively about abuse.

121
00:06:30,798 --> 00:06:35,060
So let's dig into a little bit more of the definitions of these words. So when I talk about asymmetric

122
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,422
experiences, what I'm talking about is letting users on different devices interact with a

123
00:06:39,462 --> 00:06:44,103
shared experience. And this is very tightly coupled with this idea of modalities of engagement.

124
00:06:44,143 --> 00:06:49,325
So we've talked about VR to VR. But what about VR to desktop, the mirror window that we take

125
00:06:49,365 --> 00:06:53,767
for granted that Daniel is going to talk about? What about VR to TV via your Chromecast? VR

126
00:06:53,787 --> 00:06:55,928
to phone? VR to AR? And we're going to ‑‑

127
00:06:56,128 --> 00:07:01,449
Also toss out a fun experimental piece that Daniel is going to show on AR to AR experiences.

128
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:07,370
Next we have asynchronous. In this case we're talking about allowing users to participate

129
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:13,232
in a shared experience even though they're not participating at the same time. Maybe

130
00:07:13,272 --> 00:07:16,673
the classic example of this is Farmville. You can go in and see your other friend's

131
00:07:16,753 --> 00:07:21,514
farms and see how they're changing. You can see they recently adopted a purple cow even

132
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:25,215
if they're not on their farm right now. And finally abuse. This is just going to be a

133
00:07:25,255 --> 00:07:25,675
big one.

134
00:07:26,455 --> 00:07:31,099
I think we're going to be talking about this a lot more as we go through VRDCs and GDCs

135
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:32,640
and figure out how to deal with this issue.

136
00:07:33,701 --> 00:07:38,645
This fourth design lens, we just need to consider potential for abuse in the very earliest stages

137
00:07:38,685 --> 00:07:39,166
of design.

138
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:41,327
Once again, Sai is going to get up and talk about that later.

139
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:47,452
So next I'm going to hand it off to Daniel and he's going to talk about asymmetry, asynchrony

140
00:07:47,473 --> 00:07:48,493
and modalities of engagement.

141
00:07:55,363 --> 00:07:55,744
Thanks, Rob.

142
00:07:56,144 --> 00:07:56,504
Hi there.

143
00:07:56,524 --> 00:07:57,225
I'm Daniel.

144
00:07:57,545 --> 00:08:00,528
I'm a VR and AR designer and prototyper at Google.

145
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:03,291
Today I'm going to be talking to you about two of the lenses

146
00:08:03,351 --> 00:08:05,212
Rob brought up earlier, specifically

147
00:08:05,232 --> 00:08:07,014
asymmetry and asynchrony.

148
00:08:07,735 --> 00:08:09,616
I'm going to be showing a bunch of different experiments

149
00:08:09,836 --> 00:08:11,338
and examples that we've done in these areas

150
00:08:11,878 --> 00:08:13,880
and focus on a variety of different modalities

151
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,224
engagements, including VR to 2D, VR to AR, and AR to AR.

152
00:08:20,058 --> 00:08:24,042
First, I'd like to talk to you about a type of asymmetry that we often take for granted,

153
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:25,263
the mirror window mode.

154
00:08:25,743 --> 00:08:30,748
The mirror window mode is a fantastic way of getting people who are in the room with

155
00:08:30,828 --> 00:08:34,111
someone in VR, but not in VR, engaged within the experience.

156
00:08:34,892 --> 00:08:38,436
Great tools like Unity and Unreal have made it super easy to implement.

157
00:08:38,736 --> 00:08:40,077
It's often a no-brainer.

158
00:08:40,638 --> 00:08:44,461
However, it's surprising how much you miss it when it's not implemented.

159
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:52,021
A great example of this is when we launched Google Earth initially. We didn't have a mirror

160
00:08:52,061 --> 00:08:53,164
window mode in Oculus.

161
00:08:54,227 --> 00:08:56,008
When Google Earth came out, I was super excited.

162
00:08:56,028 --> 00:08:57,589
I invited my parents over to try it.

163
00:08:57,889 --> 00:09:00,291
My dad jumped into VR, and my mom sat on the couch.

164
00:09:00,812 --> 00:09:01,552
My dad loved it.

165
00:09:01,572 --> 00:09:03,574
He was exploring all these different cities.

166
00:09:03,894 --> 00:09:05,435
But my mom kind of sat there frustrated.

167
00:09:05,455 --> 00:09:08,017
She kept asking what's going on, and I couldn't really help her out.

168
00:09:08,037 --> 00:09:09,858
It was overall kind of a frustrating experience.

169
00:09:10,499 --> 00:09:14,882
A couple weeks later, the team updated to have a mirror window mode, and it was a completely

170
00:09:14,942 --> 00:09:15,743
different experience.

171
00:09:16,464 --> 00:09:21,028
My dad again jumped into VR, but now I was offering different places he could explore.

172
00:09:21,068 --> 00:09:22,730
My mom was pointing out things that he missed.

173
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,492
Ultimately, we were kind of like backseat driving in VR.

174
00:09:25,512 --> 00:09:26,073
It was great.

175
00:09:26,093 --> 00:09:26,753
It was a lot of fun.

176
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,442
On Daydream, we saw how valuable the second screen experience was.

177
00:09:34,363 --> 00:09:38,545
So over the summer, we announced that we're going to be adding casting support to the

178
00:09:38,565 --> 00:09:39,186
Daydream headset.

179
00:09:39,506 --> 00:09:44,909
This means that you can share the view of any of your Daydream experiences to any cast-enabled

180
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:45,870
device in the house.

181
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:50,732
This transforms a single-person VR experience to something that's fun for anyone on the

182
00:09:50,773 --> 00:09:51,913
couch or anyone in the room.

183
00:09:54,235 --> 00:09:56,316
So like I said, we love the mirror window mode.

184
00:09:56,756 --> 00:09:58,297
But we think we can take it a step further.

185
00:09:59,576 --> 00:10:05,237
Interactive asymmetry lets the users not in VR engage in the experience in a much more

186
00:10:05,557 --> 00:10:06,157
meaningful way.

187
00:10:06,177 --> 00:10:09,638
A couple of examples of this could be super simple things.

188
00:10:10,258 --> 00:10:14,419
Giving the user the ability to move the camera around, look at the scene from different perspectives.

189
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:19,080
Or coming up with interesting interaction models between those in VR and those not in

190
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,721
VR that lean on the advantages of both mediums.

191
00:10:22,061 --> 00:10:23,741
An example of this could be someone's in...

192
00:10:24,806 --> 00:10:28,613
A cave in VR and the other person has a map and they have to work together and talk together

193
00:10:28,673 --> 00:10:30,496
so it becomes a fun experience for everyone around.

194
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:37,067
Alchemy Labs in their app Job Simulator launched a spectator cam feature.

195
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:42,794
As you can see here, it's the normal mirror window mode initially, first person, but simply

196
00:10:42,834 --> 00:10:46,097
by clicking click to cycle cameras, you're able to switch views.

197
00:10:46,518 --> 00:10:48,059
Now, why is this important?

198
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,380
Mirror window is great.

199
00:10:49,641 --> 00:10:53,304
However, when it's a first person view in VR, it's often a little confusing for people

200
00:10:53,344 --> 00:10:54,926
outside VR to understand what's happening.

201
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:59,249
The camera moves around a lot. You kind of just get a sense of what people are looking at in

202
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:02,851
that moment in their hands. However, once you start allowing people to move the cameras

203
00:11:02,891 --> 00:11:07,274
around, get different perspectives, you get a sense of the avatars, you get a better sense of

204
00:11:07,314 --> 00:11:12,018
the environment and what's happening throughout the experience. More fun for the people

205
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:15,100
outside, more able to understand.

206
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,881
You can also do this through a Chromecast.

207
00:11:19,342 --> 00:11:20,944
So this is a custom Chromecast view.

208
00:11:21,345 --> 00:11:24,590
This was an app that the Daydream Labs team put

209
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,574
together, where you could see a lot of what makes this app fun

210
00:11:27,734 --> 00:11:31,199
is the expressions on the people's faces, the character

211
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:33,342
design, and the interactions between them.

212
00:11:33,883 --> 00:11:38,946
Had this just been simply a mirror mode, then all you would see would be lots of great shots

213
00:11:39,007 --> 00:11:42,349
of the environment. And while the environment is beautiful, that's not kind of what makes

214
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:48,593
this app special. So simply by writing a custom Chromecast protocol and putting in a third

215
00:11:48,633 --> 00:11:53,276
camera, you're able to achieve a much more exciting experience for those outside of VR.

216
00:11:55,958 --> 00:12:00,762
Now, this expands beyond just TVs and your monitors. It also expands to devices that

217
00:12:00,782 --> 00:12:01,342
are in your pocket.

218
00:12:02,457 --> 00:12:07,161
This was an experiment that our Daydream Labs team did where they were analyzing how to

219
00:12:07,201 --> 00:12:11,484
translate the great act of reading your kid a storybook to VR.

220
00:12:11,885 --> 00:12:16,609
So in this case, the child goes into VR and gets to witness all the exciting, amazing

221
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:18,010
things of immersive storytelling.

222
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:23,275
The parent using the device that's just in their pocket can not only see where that child is

223
00:12:23,315 --> 00:12:26,218
looking but what they're focusing on, what they're excited about, what they're interacting

224
00:12:26,498 --> 00:12:31,243
and can walk them through the story. It becomes a much more interactive experience and becomes

225
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:34,206
more of a conversation than a single person isolating experience.

226
00:12:37,428 --> 00:12:42,453
Another great way of doing asymmetry is through live streaming. While the other examples were

227
00:12:42,493 --> 00:12:46,197
specifically for the people who were in that room, live streaming gives you the opportunity

228
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:51,262
to share out through YouTube or Twitch to anyone who happens to be watching in real

229
00:12:51,282 --> 00:12:53,405
time and then save it for later for anyone who is not.

230
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:58,752
Now, this is also another method that you can enhance by making more interactive.

231
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:03,873
You can see here that the team at Fantastic Contraption did this awesome thing where not

232
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:08,194
only are they streaming out live, but they're also bringing in the live Twitch comments.

233
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:12,596
So again, it becomes this more interactive conversation between the people in VR and

234
00:13:12,636 --> 00:13:13,496
those outside of VR.

235
00:13:15,997 --> 00:13:19,378
So asymmetry lets us share experiences across devices.

236
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:20,258
This is awesome.

237
00:13:21,178 --> 00:13:23,999
Asymmetry lets us share experiences across time.

238
00:13:26,018 --> 00:13:32,720
So why is this important? VR to VR, asymmetry, these are awesome experiences. However, the

239
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,961
amount of simultaneous users is inherently limited at the moment, either by the people

240
00:13:37,021 --> 00:13:41,181
who are in the room or those who are there in realtime online.

241
00:13:43,402 --> 00:13:47,963
By sharing out, you dramatically increase your potential audience, not only through

242
00:13:48,023 --> 00:13:51,623
the amount of users through time, but also through the amount of form factors that can

243
00:13:51,723 --> 00:13:52,143
access it.

244
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:56,852
A great example of this is through YouTube.

245
00:13:56,872 --> 00:13:59,876
You can see here, this is a video from Tilbrush.

246
00:13:59,956 --> 00:14:03,942
Someone painted this incredibly beautiful painting of Wonder Woman.

247
00:14:04,062 --> 00:14:04,622
It's 3D.

248
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:05,303
It's awesome.

249
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:08,648
But not only is this just a video capture, it's actually a stereo 360 capture.

250
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:10,970
of the scene.

251
00:14:11,331 --> 00:14:16,492
So that means as a viewer online, I'm able to interact with the scene, look and focus

252
00:14:16,532 --> 00:14:19,672
on what I think is interesting and important, if I think the background is awesome, I can

253
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,773
focus on that, if I like these characters or explosions, whatever I want.

254
00:14:22,993 --> 00:14:26,734
And what's great about this is not only is it available on your web, but it's also available

255
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:28,714
on a variety of different form factors.

256
00:14:28,954 --> 00:14:32,995
So if I just take my phone, open this video, I can navigate the scene by just moving my

257
00:14:33,015 --> 00:14:37,136
phone around, or if I pop in a cardboard or a Daydream device, I can view it in beautiful

258
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:37,476
stereo.

259
00:14:40,606 --> 00:14:43,268
Another avenue for sharing out is through mixed reality captures.

260
00:14:44,068 --> 00:14:44,829
This is super cool.

261
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:50,053
So what this basically is, if you haven't seen it before, is it's superimposing a real

262
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:55,897
video of the person who's using the VR experience within the VR experience itself.

263
00:14:56,357 --> 00:14:57,178
So why is this important?

264
00:14:57,758 --> 00:15:01,581
Well, there are a lot of people out there who have yet to try the awesomeness of VR.

265
00:15:02,725 --> 00:15:07,029
And when thinking about sharing out, this is a great way that we can make VR much more

266
00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:10,432
accessible for people who have an experience, who don't understand what motion controllers

267
00:15:10,592 --> 00:15:11,693
are or what a headset are.

268
00:15:12,794 --> 00:15:14,876
And ultimately make it a much more human experience.

269
00:15:17,539 --> 00:15:20,341
Now what about asynchrony within VR and AR experiences?

270
00:15:21,662 --> 00:15:25,166
How can we make more awesome asynchronous experiences?

271
00:15:25,564 --> 00:15:29,947
Well, we love the idea that when you interact with the virtual world, just like in the real

272
00:15:29,967 --> 00:15:35,210
world, it leaves a lasting effect. Your presence matters in this world. In this demo above,

273
00:15:35,391 --> 00:15:39,213
you can see someone tending to their garden, making changes, choosing what veggies to plant.

274
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:44,276
They're making an effect on the world. The next time someone goes into the app, they

275
00:15:44,296 --> 00:15:49,160
can see all the decisions the previous person made. It allows for a sense of community even

276
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:54,823
when people aren't in the app at the same time. So that's sharing apps.

277
00:15:57,215 --> 00:15:59,117
Now we got another one in here, VR to AR.

278
00:15:59,538 --> 00:16:01,199
With the launch of AR-enabled smartphones,

279
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,021
soon to be on hundreds of millions of phones,

280
00:16:04,022 --> 00:16:06,084
soon many people will have a six-off

281
00:16:06,224 --> 00:16:07,566
enabled device in their pockets.

282
00:16:08,547 --> 00:16:10,529
This enables new types of interactivity

283
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:12,170
that build off of some of the things

284
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,451
I talked about with sharing out,

285
00:16:14,032 --> 00:16:16,595
but allow you to also utilize spatial information

286
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:17,936
and touch interaction.

287
00:16:20,807 --> 00:16:24,849
This was an example we built. It's kind of dark. You can't see it. But it's of a social

288
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:29,753
movie making app. Basically you can grab a bunch of objects and props from the scene,

289
00:16:29,993 --> 00:16:33,996
throw it onto the stage and animate them with another person simply by picking them up,

290
00:16:34,336 --> 00:16:36,837
clicking record and moving them around and animating them throughout the scene.

291
00:16:37,438 --> 00:16:42,383
We wanted an awesome way to share out. So we came up with this idea of putting a little

292
00:16:42,403 --> 00:16:47,028
camera in the scene. You can see a view finder on that camera. And one person can shrink

293
00:16:47,068 --> 00:16:52,033
down to the size of the stage and film the scene, creating an awesome video for YouTube,

294
00:16:52,393 --> 00:16:56,958
viewable in many different formats. We think it's super fun. People came up with really,

295
00:16:56,978 --> 00:16:59,821
really fun stories that we shared out internally.

296
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,643
We thought this was fun but we wanted to push ourselves to think about new ways to engage

297
00:17:05,683 --> 00:17:14,348
other form factors, particularly AR. We came up with this concept. How can we use the 6-off

298
00:17:14,728 --> 00:17:21,212
AR phones that we have to interact with this kind of scene? In this case, you can see that

299
00:17:21,232 --> 00:17:27,076
we replaced that camera I showed in the last scene with the actual AR view. So what that

300
00:17:27,116 --> 00:17:29,217
means is it's no longer just a viewing experience.

301
00:17:30,388 --> 00:17:35,050
The person in AR is actually the person who creates the output, the thing that goes on

302
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:35,410
YouTube.

303
00:17:36,031 --> 00:17:36,771
It engages them.

304
00:17:36,871 --> 00:17:42,473
It becomes less of I get the lesser experience because I'm not in VR and more of a working

305
00:17:42,513 --> 00:17:43,674
together companion experience.

306
00:17:44,534 --> 00:17:48,516
There's a lot of possibilities when building AR to VR interactions.

307
00:17:48,836 --> 00:17:50,576
We're really excited to see what you guys come up with.

308
00:17:52,557 --> 00:17:54,138
So finally, AR to AR.

309
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:59,140
We're incredibly excited with how multiplayer can make AR experiences more awesome.

310
00:18:00,069 --> 00:18:06,717
We wanted to show a fun experiment that we did in this area. We call this AR boat race. Both

311
00:18:06,757 --> 00:18:07,919
people have their own boats.

312
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:12,604
in their hand from their phone. They're placed spatially within the scene and all they have

313
00:18:12,644 --> 00:18:17,448
to do is blow on the phone and push the sails down the scene. You can see it's super simple,

314
00:18:17,689 --> 00:18:22,893
it's really fun and people who do it get really competitive. You can see right now Kevin's

315
00:18:22,933 --> 00:18:28,618
in the lead but Samantha's catching up quickly and Samantha gets across the finish line.

316
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:31,601
So like I said, it's super simple but just ‑‑

317
00:18:32,539 --> 00:18:36,984
The easy way of making this multiplayer using the space and using novel input methods makes

318
00:18:37,024 --> 00:18:39,387
it a really, really fun interactive experience.

319
00:18:43,031 --> 00:18:45,834
So there's a lot of awesome right now in VR and AR.

320
00:18:46,675 --> 00:18:49,818
Incredible platforms, new tech, and new experiences.

321
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:50,980
More and more every day.

322
00:18:52,445 --> 00:18:54,767
We think it's super important to be creative

323
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,288
in thinking about how you can combine

324
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,029
all these awesome emerging technologies

325
00:18:58,509 --> 00:19:02,051
to better create, interact, and make the content

326
00:19:02,331 --> 00:19:05,213
more consumable for those in VR and non-VR.

327
00:19:06,453 --> 00:19:08,815
We've talked a lot about creating awesome social experiences

328
00:19:09,555 --> 00:19:10,736
but creating these experiences

329
00:19:11,336 --> 00:19:12,837
also comes with a large responsibility,

330
00:19:13,537 --> 00:19:15,118
thinking about and mitigating abuse.

331
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:17,920
To talk more about this, sorry.

332
00:19:26,938 --> 00:19:33,404
Oh, people are tall. Hi, new friends. I'm Cy Wise. I work at Alchemy Labs. I am their

333
00:19:33,864 --> 00:19:40,009
studio director, owlmancer, and also science. You may have noticed that Job Simulator and

334
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:45,154
Rick and Morty Virtual Reality, neither one are multipresence VR experiences. So why the

335
00:19:45,174 --> 00:19:50,759
heck am I here? So, oh, what is going on? I want that one.

336
00:19:52,563 --> 00:19:57,966
Hello. So my background in academia and things, so my background is in sociology. I focus

337
00:19:58,007 --> 00:20:03,610
specifically on video game communities, digital tribes, internet fandoms, in addition to that

338
00:20:03,751 --> 00:20:06,753
also computer mediated communication, basically looking at

339
00:20:10,996 --> 00:20:19,523
I'm also an 11-year industry vet, and the majority of that was actually massively multiplayer

340
00:20:19,623 --> 00:20:20,663
online role-playing games.

341
00:20:21,404 --> 00:20:25,587
I worked for NCSoft for a long time, worked on Ion, Lineage, City of Heroes, Guild Wars,

342
00:20:25,607 --> 00:20:26,728
all these games.

343
00:20:26,868 --> 00:20:30,711
And a lot of what I did there was I actually managed the harassment department, sort of

344
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:34,795
dealing with people who had been harassed, looking at different types of harassment and

345
00:20:34,815 --> 00:20:35,355
helping people out.

346
00:20:36,262 --> 00:20:40,308
I also happen to be both privately and publicly a woman on the internet.

347
00:20:40,848 --> 00:20:45,835
I have occasionally engaged in business or entertainment activities on the internet,

348
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:50,501
given opinions, all of which add up to knowing about harassment.

349
00:20:52,021 --> 00:20:55,746
So before I get too far along, I want to preemptively apologize.

350
00:20:56,827 --> 00:20:58,669
It sucks that we have to talk about this.

351
00:20:59,229 --> 00:21:06,398
VR is such a cool medium and it's so optimistic and we think about all the things like VR alone makes you think about what's

352
00:21:06,478 --> 00:21:12,965
possible that was never possible before and then we have to spend time talking about abuse and people are gonna be rude.

353
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:18,472
So, I want to thank you all for being here and being willing to think about this and

354
00:21:18,532 --> 00:21:19,293
talk about this.

355
00:21:19,813 --> 00:21:22,016
And also, now that I've said it, now you can't leave early.

356
00:21:22,276 --> 00:21:23,237
Ah, did you see what I did there?

357
00:21:25,057 --> 00:21:29,181
So I want to start with some definitions, sort of a taxonomy of harassment.

358
00:21:30,162 --> 00:21:34,166
So this can sort of break down into several modes that people are going to be gross to

359
00:21:34,186 --> 00:21:34,506
each other.

360
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,369
One is auditory, saying gross things.

361
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:43,996
This is basically using voice chat or text, sending e‑mails, just being rude, saying

362
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:48,080
rude things to other people in a rude way is auditory.

363
00:21:49,236 --> 00:21:53,178
Gestural is using rudimentary gestures to convey gross concepts.

364
00:21:54,439 --> 00:22:00,643
In massively multiplayer games, this has been sort of like using emotes or whatever, using

365
00:22:00,723 --> 00:22:04,245
rough gestures that are available and stringing them together in a sort of way that conveys

366
00:22:04,285 --> 00:22:05,165
gross concepts.

367
00:22:06,306 --> 00:22:13,450
In VR, especially with six-off hands, you have a whole new range of gross gestural experiences

368
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,451
because we are very creative as human beings.

369
00:22:16,932 --> 00:22:22,054
We also have environmental. This is basically using the elements of the environment in gross ways.

370
00:22:23,055 --> 00:22:27,476
In traditional games, this could be the sort of thing of dragging higher level monsters into a low level area.

371
00:22:32,979 --> 00:22:41,224
In VR, especially with six to off head and hands and interactable environment, this can

372
00:22:41,244 --> 00:22:45,707
be the sort of things like, you know, throwing things at people constantly, you know, putting

373
00:22:46,227 --> 00:22:49,609
objects on people's heads, obscuring their ability to sort of interact with the world.

374
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:58,404
with VR, there's bodily. Bodily is using one's own body to be gross to another person's body.

375
00:22:59,085 --> 00:23:05,510
And this is sort of new to VR. Basically because we have embodied avatars, you're able to sort

376
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:06,751
of interact with each other.

377
00:23:07,932 --> 00:23:11,956
It's a game that's designed to touch and interact and move around other people's bodies in heck and gross ways.

378
00:23:12,477 --> 00:23:15,360
And between the sense of presence and the freedom of sixth-dof movement,

379
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,683
even if these existed in other sorts of environments,

380
00:23:18,803 --> 00:23:21,806
it becomes incredibly heightened and magnified in VR.

381
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:25,477
So what's currently being talked about?

382
00:23:26,337 --> 00:23:27,919
Because I am not the first to talk about it.

383
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:33,523
VR has actually identified this as a problem and a lot of people engaging or who are creating

384
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:35,805
social VR experiences are talking about VR.

385
00:23:36,446 --> 00:23:38,127
And they are trying to implement things.

386
00:23:38,487 --> 00:23:43,351
So most of what's being talked about right now really revolves around tools, specifically

387
00:23:43,411 --> 00:23:44,392
tools for the harassed.

388
00:23:45,393 --> 00:23:50,134
The block and ignore feature is one that is in most VR games now.

389
00:23:50,854 --> 00:23:54,715
This is alt space. It has the ability to basically block any character.

390
00:23:55,435 --> 00:24:01,156
This is useful for VR with limited or a broad range of interaction abilities.

391
00:24:01,577 --> 00:24:06,018
So alt space is you can use it in the Oculus Rift or you can use it in the Vive,

392
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:08,798
but you can also access it with a cardboard or Gear VR,

393
00:24:09,098 --> 00:24:11,099
and you can even get through it with a web browser.

394
00:24:11,459 --> 00:24:14,880
So having the same way to block somebody no matter what.

395
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:20,363
technology you're using is really useful for them so that people don't have to figure

396
00:24:20,403 --> 00:24:24,085
out the new way to block somebody in a new situation.

397
00:24:26,587 --> 00:24:27,848
Rec room is another one.

398
00:24:27,888 --> 00:24:31,390
They have a gestural movement which is actually being talked about a lot.

399
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,712
This is basically the ability to, oh, hello.

400
00:24:36,277 --> 00:24:36,397
Yeah.

401
00:24:36,857 --> 00:24:40,180
So this is basically when you actually use an actual gesture.

402
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:45,224
This works incredibly well with 6DoF hand tracking.

403
00:24:45,664 --> 00:24:50,388
And it's commonly agreed upon that this gesture-based or other physical resource is really instant

404
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:51,148
and gratifying.

405
00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:55,432
Not only does it act sort of as like it's just constantly in your back pocket.

406
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:58,494
You don't have to go through menu systems to try and figure out where the block is.

407
00:24:58,814 --> 00:25:01,056
It's just always there and available to you.

408
00:25:01,636 --> 00:25:04,138
And the other thing is that in a resource and in a...

409
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:10,822
In a VR experience that is very physical, having a physical response matches that sort of

410
00:25:12,162 --> 00:25:17,105
the desire to respond is to respond physically and having that physical response feels a lot more

411
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:22,067
useful. In addition to the fact that a lot of times when people are all getting up in your face

412
00:25:22,607 --> 00:25:27,329
they can actually like clip through any UI that you might be using. So having a gesture that again

413
00:25:27,369 --> 00:25:30,451
you have access to instantly is really useful in this situation.

414
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:35,548
I want to take a quick note here about ghosting versus invisibility.

415
00:25:35,848 --> 00:25:37,629
So once you block somebody, what does it do?

416
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:44,474
So in the past, Rec Room has done a lot of experiences and a lot of experiments.

417
00:25:44,854 --> 00:25:48,917
Rec Room used to use this ghosting ability, which is once you blocked, basically everyone

418
00:25:48,957 --> 00:25:49,678
turned into a ghost.

419
00:25:49,818 --> 00:25:51,539
I turned, if someone was harassing me,

420
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:53,440
they turned into a ghost, I turned into a ghost,

421
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,781
we're all ghosts to each other.

422
00:25:55,461 --> 00:25:56,922
And basically what that was supposed to do

423
00:25:56,942 --> 00:25:58,763
was sort of tone down the harassment.

424
00:25:58,803 --> 00:26:01,345
It was supposed to put like a mute on the experience.

425
00:26:01,585 --> 00:26:02,846
You couldn't hear them anymore,

426
00:26:02,926 --> 00:26:04,507
you couldn't see their face, you know,

427
00:26:04,627 --> 00:26:07,268
or what their face was doing, they didn't have hands.

428
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:10,110
And it worked really well in terms of like

429
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,451
dimming the emotional response, right?

430
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:14,493
And again, you had an effect on the world.

431
00:26:14,593 --> 00:26:16,714
I blocked someone, something happened.

432
00:26:17,996 --> 00:26:23,003
Unfortunately, everybody else could see both of these characters as non-ghosts.

433
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:29,253
This is really important because harassment often isn't just to harass the individual.

434
00:26:29,273 --> 00:26:31,094
It isn't just to hurt the target.

435
00:26:31,414 --> 00:26:32,995
It is often very performative.

436
00:26:33,376 --> 00:26:38,919
Harassment is often done for the audience of everyone else to see how edgy they are

437
00:26:39,019 --> 00:26:40,140
in harassing these people.

438
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:44,363
So even though they're both ghosts, the harasser could still see where the originally harassed

439
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:48,205
person was and could still act on them in a way that everybody else could see.

440
00:26:48,845 --> 00:26:50,406
This is no longer what Rec Room does.

441
00:26:51,087 --> 00:26:55,590
Rec Room now does the invisibility method, where both parties become invisible to each

442
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:55,790
other.

443
00:26:56,670 --> 00:27:00,133
But this was a really interesting experiment and allowed us to find these things out.

444
00:27:03,074 --> 00:27:06,056
Another thing that people are talking about is the personal space bubble.

445
00:27:06,717 --> 00:27:08,818
High Fidelity has one of these, which I love.

446
00:27:09,198 --> 00:27:14,281
It basically allows sort of a ring around people that if they try and cross that ring,

447
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:15,882
they just sort of zoop out.

448
00:27:16,223 --> 00:27:16,903
They don't exist.

449
00:27:16,923 --> 00:27:17,283
They're like...

450
00:27:17,724 --> 00:27:19,565
are not allowed to come into your personal space.

451
00:27:20,266 --> 00:27:24,208
This is really great in terms of being able to protect people

452
00:27:24,529 --> 00:27:28,151
and set their own boundaries based on what sort of interaction they want.

453
00:27:28,411 --> 00:27:32,955
And it goes a long way in terms of stopping the harassment before it begins,

454
00:27:33,055 --> 00:27:34,696
at least in terms of bodily harassment.

455
00:27:35,376 --> 00:27:37,578
They can't even get to you to hurt you.

456
00:27:38,999 --> 00:27:43,420
The last thing that's being talked about a lot is surveillance and specifically audio

457
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,260
and video surveillance.

458
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,300
It's talked about a lot, but it isn't solved.

459
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:51,561
This is an incredibly hard problem to solve right now.

460
00:27:52,321 --> 00:27:58,083
Everybody sort of wants the ideal world where like all audio and all video is always recorded

461
00:27:58,103 --> 00:27:59,823
and there's just a buffer running at all times.

462
00:28:00,243 --> 00:28:03,644
So if somebody gets harassed, they can be like, ah, I can prove it to you.

463
00:28:03,984 --> 00:28:06,785
It happened and it was recorded and I have now given you the thing.

464
00:28:07,425 --> 00:28:12,668
And that would be an ideal situation in order to take action on these individuals who are

465
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:13,548
harassing others.

466
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,390
Unfortunately, that's incredibly resource intensive.

467
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:22,333
For every single interaction of every human being in every lobby, in every private lobby,

468
00:28:22,473 --> 00:28:25,695
it's a huge task and is unsolved.

469
00:28:28,029 --> 00:28:29,249
So, what isn't being talked about?

470
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,913
Messaging and sharing isn't actually being talked about a whole lot.

471
00:28:36,213 --> 00:28:37,253
This is getting the word out.

472
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:43,076
There are ways that people are talking about their harassment tools and sharing code of

473
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,397
conducts and expectations.

474
00:28:45,117 --> 00:28:48,859
Rec Room has a video series called How to Rec Room that shows a bunch of different...

475
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:50,961
There are tools that they have available.

476
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:53,263
There are blogs that people can go and read.

477
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:56,006
These all happen outside of the VR experience.

478
00:28:57,207 --> 00:29:01,531
Inside the VR experience, people are still working on ways that they can best communicate

479
00:29:01,591 --> 00:29:07,596
expected behavior and tools that people have access to, whether this is tutorials or notices.

480
00:29:08,097 --> 00:29:09,378
Reading in VR is kind of rough.

481
00:29:09,598 --> 00:29:12,601
I don't know if I would recommend that, but this is the problem.

482
00:29:14,443 --> 00:29:17,165
The reason why this is so much a problem is that there are no best practices yet.

483
00:29:18,085 --> 00:29:22,248
Which there's a larger discussion of can there be best practices in VR yet when we're still

484
00:29:22,368 --> 00:29:26,691
only been out for about a year and should we have stopped experimenting yet.

485
00:29:27,272 --> 00:29:29,834
We do need to experiment and continue to do so.

486
00:29:30,154 --> 00:29:33,916
But the problem without having best practices on this yet is that players don't know where

487
00:29:33,956 --> 00:29:34,917
to look for these things.

488
00:29:35,417 --> 00:29:39,481
If there are best practices and everyone sort of agrees that this is how you find and access

489
00:29:39,521 --> 00:29:42,163
this information, then players know where to look for this.

490
00:29:42,223 --> 00:29:44,285
Until we have that, it's going to be a little bit rough.

491
00:29:45,626 --> 00:29:49,069
Persistent identity, permanence of consequences.

492
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:54,614
There's still a lot of ability for people to log out and switch avatars and switch names

493
00:29:54,634 --> 00:29:56,195
and come back in and harass people again.

494
00:29:56,636 --> 00:29:59,938
So even if somebody's been blocked by every single person in that game, they can just

495
00:29:59,978 --> 00:30:01,800
go out and create a new identity and come back in.

496
00:30:03,141 --> 00:30:05,163
It makes consequences really impermanent.

497
00:30:06,384 --> 00:30:10,167
There are ideas that you can actually pull on from other online experiences, say

498
00:30:11,088 --> 00:30:15,291
reputation systems, where you have the sort of persistent like

499
00:30:16,052 --> 00:30:19,875
judgment from the community that basically says, I am a giant jerk.

500
00:30:20,796 --> 00:30:26,541
This won't keep people from harassing people entirely, but it will help some people decide not to harass people.

501
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:30,810
If there is that consequence that they have to carry their actions with them.

502
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:35,916
It also allows the community to sort of identify somebody and be like, ah, that guy's a heckin'

503
00:30:35,956 --> 00:30:36,256
troll.

504
00:30:36,537 --> 00:30:40,321
I want nothing to do with that human being and sort of avoid that person to begin with.

505
00:30:40,441 --> 00:30:42,404
So that's something that needs to be talked about a little bit more.

506
00:30:43,785 --> 00:30:46,347
Another thing that's not being talked about much is lack of agency.

507
00:30:47,527 --> 00:30:53,291
VR is a medium of agency, and when an individual is harassed, especially bodily, when someone's

508
00:30:53,311 --> 00:30:57,373
all up in their face, like you want to have a physical response, right?

509
00:30:57,413 --> 00:30:59,054
This is why the gesture works really well.

510
00:30:59,754 --> 00:31:04,277
But again, a lot of times you get the sense that you've lost agency over your own body.

511
00:31:04,337 --> 00:31:09,720
Someone has affected you bodily, and you weren't able to stop them, and you can't really affect

512
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,562
them in the way that you want to affect them, because they're intangible.

513
00:31:13,182 --> 00:31:18,163
A lot of these tools that we're designing need to have the concept of how do we also

514
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:23,025
give agency back to these players and make them feel comfortable and safe and one with

515
00:31:23,065 --> 00:31:27,986
their avatar again. The last thing I want to talk about that isn't being talked about

516
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:33,327
is tools for the not immediately harassed. This is a really nuanced sort of thing that's

517
00:31:33,367 --> 00:31:40,048
come up recently. This is a quote from Cameron from Against Gravity. It's a really difficult

518
00:31:40,088 --> 00:31:41,949
problem. Full disclosure, this was me.

519
00:31:43,249 --> 00:31:46,112
I was harassed in VR, in rec room.

520
00:31:46,692 --> 00:31:49,054
And I went through the whole gamut,

521
00:31:49,114 --> 00:31:50,996
like the whole, I went through the taxonomy,

522
00:31:51,056 --> 00:31:53,117
I had the whole survey.

523
00:31:53,618 --> 00:31:55,559
And so as I'm sitting there trying to navigate

524
00:31:55,579 --> 00:31:56,660
through my menu system,

525
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,221
because I didn't know about the gesture yet,

526
00:31:58,582 --> 00:32:00,103
as I was trying to go through the menu system

527
00:32:00,123 --> 00:32:01,344
to figure out I was having a rough time,

528
00:32:01,384 --> 00:32:02,965
the guy was clipping through my arm,

529
00:32:03,365 --> 00:32:04,987
so I couldn't get to my menu system.

530
00:32:05,587 --> 00:32:07,969
And what I did is something that a lot of people do.

531
00:32:08,069 --> 00:32:10,211
I looked up at my friends who had been spending

532
00:32:10,271 --> 00:32:11,532
the past couple of hours with me.

533
00:32:12,512 --> 00:32:13,833
And they're all looking at their watch.

534
00:32:14,634 --> 00:32:19,016
Now, I know, because they are my friends, that they were also looking for the block

535
00:32:19,056 --> 00:32:20,116
button to block somebody.

536
00:32:20,576 --> 00:32:25,159
But the optics of it actually read very much like someone trying to disengage from the

537
00:32:25,219 --> 00:32:25,599
experience.

538
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:26,920
This is awkward.

539
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,141
I don't want to be a part of this.

540
00:32:29,301 --> 00:32:31,802
So I'm just going to flip through my phone.

541
00:32:33,443 --> 00:32:37,424
So the idea of the optics of the people who want to help out

542
00:32:38,204 --> 00:32:41,585
is really important there in terms of giving support to the people who are being harassed.

543
00:32:41,945 --> 00:32:45,506
Additionally, there are some people who want to, like maybe off to the side,

544
00:32:45,906 --> 00:32:48,867
watching this behavior, may find it gross and want nothing to do with it,

545
00:32:48,887 --> 00:32:51,408
but they don't want to necessarily announce to the world.

546
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:57,912
that they're blocking somebody. They may be afraid of being attacked themselves if they announce that they're blocking this person.

547
00:32:58,593 --> 00:33:02,055
So maybe they want to do something a little bit privately. Maybe they want to make a show of like,

548
00:33:02,135 --> 00:33:06,338
yes, I support this person. And there's some nuances there that hasn't really been discussed.

549
00:33:08,793 --> 00:33:15,160
So we can experiment right now. There's a lot to experiment with in terms of what we can make for VR that works in VR.

550
00:33:16,742 --> 00:33:21,648
There's some, there's, you can basically break these down into preemptive and reactive sort of tool sets.

551
00:33:22,228 --> 00:33:28,295
So preemptive, these are like making design decisions that encourage positive behavior or sort of stop the harassment before it begins.

552
00:33:29,356 --> 00:33:35,398
This can be like allowing players to customize their own levels of interaction before they even get into the space.

553
00:33:36,418 --> 00:33:42,200
Rec Room has a little private lobby where people log in and the first thing they end up is in their dorm room and they

554
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:48,402
can choose their avatar like shirts and hair and customize what they want to look like and this is fantastic.

555
00:33:49,322 --> 00:33:53,483
But could you also choose perhaps the level of interaction you want to have that day?

556
00:33:53,884 --> 00:33:56,805
Maybe you want to meet a whole bunch of cool new people and you want to go out and

557
00:33:57,405 --> 00:33:59,166
If it's me, I'm going to talk about my cats.

558
00:33:59,266 --> 00:34:03,588
But you want to go out and meet new people and have conversations about VR and you're

559
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:04,468
feeling really positive.

560
00:34:04,508 --> 00:34:07,550
You could just go out and set yourself to public and meet all sorts of new people.

561
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:13,693
But if you're having a rough day and you just kind of want to hang out with your friends

562
00:34:13,953 --> 00:34:19,575
and just talk about your cats or play disc golf or Cards Against Humanity or whatever

563
00:34:19,595 --> 00:34:20,156
it is you want to do.

564
00:34:20,956 --> 00:34:23,939
Could you actually set yourself to basically kind of being invisible,

565
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:28,202
so that you can like go out and only be visible to other people on your friends list?

566
00:34:28,523 --> 00:34:31,665
Could you make it so you don't see anyone besides people on your friends list?

567
00:34:32,366 --> 00:34:37,430
There are ways with VR that people can customize their own experience in VR,

568
00:34:38,271 --> 00:34:39,652
which I'd really like to see us play with.

569
00:34:41,378 --> 00:34:49,962
The other thing that you could do is basically remind people sort of what the expected behavior is.

570
00:34:50,263 --> 00:34:53,404
And there are things like code of conduct, you could do like cool posters on the wall or whatever

571
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,226
to sort of remind people of expected behavior.

572
00:34:55,486 --> 00:34:58,708
But there are also design considerations that you can make.

573
00:34:59,685 --> 00:35:01,166
This is something that Daydream was working on.

574
00:35:01,486 --> 00:35:02,326
It's the dog demo.

575
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:03,506
The dog's playing poker demo.

576
00:35:03,886 --> 00:35:05,747
If I were playing poker, I'd want to be a dog.

577
00:35:06,887 --> 00:35:11,908
So basically the idea is that you have a multi-present VR experience where people are playing poker

578
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:16,669
and one person loses, and it's always me that loses, and they get heckin' mad, and so they

579
00:35:16,769 --> 00:35:22,551
stand up and they go over to like, I don't give peace of my mind, and the entire world

580
00:35:22,611 --> 00:35:26,171
goes black and white and it dims a little bit, and the person looks around and the only

581
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:29,372
thing that's highlighted is the chair that they were previously sitting in.

582
00:35:30,353 --> 00:35:34,456
Maybe they should go back and sit in that chair. That would be fun.

583
00:35:35,156 --> 00:35:39,959
And that's the sort of like design sort of consideration you can do to encourage people to like

584
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:45,143
engage in good positive behaviors. Just sort of remind people what's expected.

585
00:35:46,704 --> 00:35:52,908
And for this sort of situation, which is fairly limited in terms of like, you know, you're seated and you're playing, that works really well.

586
00:35:55,276 --> 00:35:55,996
Reactive.

587
00:35:56,676 --> 00:35:59,637
Designing tools that allow victimized players to protect each other.

588
00:35:59,677 --> 00:36:01,838
This is after the harassment has occurred.

589
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:03,078
This is already sad times.

590
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:06,660
But we want the tools to report and remove the threat instantly.

591
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:10,221
We're already working on that with the block and report buttons.

592
00:36:11,441 --> 00:36:14,482
We want consistent and clear punishment for offending players.

593
00:36:14,963 --> 00:36:16,983
I talked about reputation systems earlier.

594
00:36:18,764 --> 00:36:20,665
These sorts of aspects can sort of make...

595
00:36:22,925 --> 00:36:32,212
So, I'm going to be talking about how to make sure that punishments can't be viewed as rewards,

596
00:36:32,672 --> 00:36:34,193
or they can't be viewed as fun.

597
00:36:34,433 --> 00:36:36,995
I've heard everything like, oh, what if we give them a dunce cap?

598
00:36:37,055 --> 00:36:40,077
Like if somebody's bad, we'll put a dunce cap.

599
00:36:40,677 --> 00:36:45,060
Well, apparently, if video games have taught me anything, it's that we are a hat-based

600
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:45,540
economy.

601
00:36:45,781 --> 00:36:46,281
And we want...

602
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:51,425
So, that's something that somebody might actually seek to go get.

603
00:36:52,526 --> 00:36:55,928
Another one that I love, I love this one, I hate it, but I love it, is the idea of like,

604
00:36:56,028 --> 00:36:57,609
oh, someone's attacking you, right?

605
00:36:57,629 --> 00:37:02,673
So, you just push them, and if you push them, they go flying back, and it's great because

606
00:37:02,693 --> 00:37:05,395
you feel super powerful, and you feel like you have your agency back.

607
00:37:05,797 --> 00:37:08,980
It has the added effect of, you know that that person's headset is going to go flying

608
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,781
and they might get a little sick and that could be cool.

609
00:37:10,801 --> 00:37:12,183
It just feels really good.

610
00:37:12,803 --> 00:37:18,088
But that's the sort of thing that harassing players would also use to harass people.

611
00:37:18,568 --> 00:37:20,410
So like, these are the sorts of things you have to think about.

612
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:24,054
Even when you're thinking of tools that, you know, could be used to help people

613
00:37:24,694 --> 00:37:27,016
you have to think about how they're going to be used to...

614
00:37:29,138 --> 00:37:29,758
Also, humor.

615
00:37:30,738 --> 00:37:35,301
Gosh, I love things that give me a chuckle, especially if it's like, oh, yeah, that's

616
00:37:35,341 --> 00:37:36,842
like perfect, that feels justified.

617
00:37:37,302 --> 00:37:44,526
So this is an example that also was tested, people were prototyping this, and it was the

618
00:37:44,586 --> 00:37:50,109
idea that if somebody started coming at the person, their hands would just fall off.

619
00:37:50,529 --> 00:37:53,931
Like if they tried to put their hands in the other person's face, their avatar's hands

620
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:54,571
would just drop.

621
00:37:55,930 --> 00:38:01,194
And it was awesome and hilarious and it felt right like yeah, we took your hands away.

622
00:38:01,795 --> 00:38:08,600
Unfortunately, everyone else thought it was funny too. And so people who might be harassing wanted their hands to fall off,

623
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,464
they thought it was hilarious. And so it inadvertently could encourage people

624
00:38:14,345 --> 00:38:16,247
to harass to see this funny effect.

625
00:38:17,107 --> 00:38:18,849
So we didn't go with that one.

626
00:38:21,086 --> 00:38:24,007
So, a note here, this is all a ton of work.

627
00:38:24,547 --> 00:38:28,108
These are really hard problems and it's a ton of work.

628
00:38:28,689 --> 00:38:34,731
It's hard, it's going to take a lot of time, a lot of human power, but the industry as

629
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:38,273
a whole is harmed by putting out a half-supported social experience.

630
00:38:38,813 --> 00:38:42,974
Just like all VR, a lot of people are going into their first social experiences in VR

631
00:38:43,775 --> 00:38:46,837
And a lot of times their first social experience is their first VR experience.

632
00:38:47,457 --> 00:38:51,300
And so there's a responsibility we have to make sure that the experiences that we're putting forth

633
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,242
are as responsible as we possibly can and make sure everyone's enjoying it.

634
00:38:54,722 --> 00:38:59,926
Somebody can be turned off from all of VR by going into a bad social experience, a bad any experience.

635
00:39:00,326 --> 00:39:03,088
So it's really important that we sort of keep these things in mind

636
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:06,210
and try and develop good practices as soon as we can.

637
00:39:07,231 --> 00:39:09,893
The other thing is that tools have to be considered during development.

638
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:17,118
Build your features and support structures into your design as you're building as early

639
00:39:17,158 --> 00:39:17,919
as you possibly can.

640
00:39:18,219 --> 00:39:22,883
If you're starting to put in tools after launch, like, it's way too late.

641
00:39:23,964 --> 00:39:26,265
Needs to be considered as part of your design.

642
00:39:26,285 --> 00:39:31,710
Because if you are designing a social experience, mitigating abuse is part of your experience.

643
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,091
I also want to touch on the culture thing.

644
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:39,753
We have the ability to reinforce culture and also social stigma, which is kind of cool.

645
00:39:40,634 --> 00:39:44,416
Culture isn't only enforced from the outside, it's encouraging the community to create and

646
00:39:44,456 --> 00:39:46,377
normalize behaviors amongst themselves.

647
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:51,900
So a lot of what you can do in your game as your making social experiences isn't just,

648
00:39:52,901 --> 00:39:57,286
A lot of times people think, like, oh, the devs are mean, and this is the nanny state,

649
00:39:57,386 --> 00:40:01,211
and they just don't want us to, they're no fun, and they don't want us to have fun, and

650
00:40:01,231 --> 00:40:04,034
they're overbanning everybody, and whatever.

651
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:09,360
You can actually encourage your community through culture, like, through the culture

652
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,863
of your game, the culture of your community outreach.

653
00:40:12,464 --> 00:40:15,066
and sort of transpose that onto your community as well.

654
00:40:15,106 --> 00:40:17,068
And your community will pick that up and run with it.

655
00:40:17,729 --> 00:40:20,031
If players have a sense of ownership of their own space

656
00:40:20,091 --> 00:40:21,873
and feel like they have the responsibility

657
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:25,317
of protecting their space, they will also do this work.

658
00:40:25,817 --> 00:40:28,020
They are happy to sort of make the space

659
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,521
the safe space that they want

660
00:40:29,641 --> 00:40:31,663
if you develop a community that sort of promotes that.

661
00:40:34,226 --> 00:40:36,669
So what am I taking home from all of this?

662
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:40,634
One, don't let abuse considerations be an afterthought.

663
00:40:41,535 --> 00:40:43,477
You want to design tools and empower your community

664
00:40:43,517 --> 00:40:44,538
from the very beginning.

665
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,061
So the minute your game launches,

666
00:40:47,121 --> 00:40:49,464
there should also be a set of tools and abilities

667
00:40:49,504 --> 00:40:51,026
for players to be able to protect themselves

668
00:40:51,326 --> 00:40:54,510
and sort of promote a good, healthy, happy community culture.

669
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:56,751
And second of all, you want to experiment.

670
00:40:57,331 --> 00:40:59,712
We're still really in the early days of VR,

671
00:41:00,253 --> 00:41:03,394
and there's so much that we can sort of play with.

672
00:41:03,554 --> 00:41:07,716
VR is best done when we're making things for VR that work in VR.

673
00:41:08,356 --> 00:41:10,637
So we can experiment a lot, and while...

674
00:41:11,397 --> 00:41:13,300
We're still sort of in our early days.

675
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,804
We have this opportunity to do so and really figure out what works best.

676
00:41:16,824 --> 00:41:20,128
We have some things that work, but we could find a lot...

677
00:41:20,148 --> 00:41:23,071
There could be a lot of other things out there that work better or interesting

678
00:41:23,271 --> 00:41:26,074
or have these additional side effects that are fantastic,

679
00:41:26,094 --> 00:41:28,297
but we only find that out through experimenting.

680
00:41:28,637 --> 00:41:33,161
So try various things, try unexpected things, silly things, stupid things.

681
00:41:33,842 --> 00:41:37,806
And I would actually encourage you to share with the developer community as well.

682
00:41:37,846 --> 00:41:39,607
We're actually constantly talking about it.

683
00:41:39,627 --> 00:41:40,788
There are a ton of resources.

684
00:41:41,309 --> 00:41:46,453
If you want to talk more about abuse and social VR, there's like Twitter, I highly recommend.

685
00:41:46,473 --> 00:41:48,816
There's constantly game devs talking about this on Twitter.

686
00:41:49,096 --> 00:41:51,958
But there are a bunch of Slack channels and groups where people are constantly sharing

687
00:41:52,038 --> 00:41:52,459
ideas.

688
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:58,645
And resources and research to sort of figure out this whole wacky wild world that we're in right now.

689
00:42:01,128 --> 00:42:02,069
And that's it for me.

690
00:42:04,071 --> 00:42:04,331
Thanks!

691
00:42:08,011 --> 00:42:08,992
Thank you, Sai.

692
00:42:09,132 --> 00:42:10,593
So I'm just going to summarize really quickly.

693
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:14,435
Some of you might be thinking, like, this talk is kind of all over the place, other

694
00:42:14,475 --> 00:42:18,638
than three major words that start with the letter A. Like, what ties this all together?

695
00:42:19,338 --> 00:42:24,221
What ties it all together is that we really feel like we looked around the design space

696
00:42:24,301 --> 00:42:25,402
that people are looking at right now.

697
00:42:25,982 --> 00:42:29,144
And from the perspective of, like, once again, I'm going to bring it up, we're looking back

698
00:42:29,745 --> 00:42:31,506
From 10 years in the future, what are we going to look at?

699
00:42:31,566 --> 00:42:33,348
Where did we not spend enough time?

700
00:42:34,068 --> 00:42:36,050
And we think that these areas that we're talking about

701
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:38,411
today are sort of these design elements where we're not

702
00:42:38,471 --> 00:42:41,994
spending enough time, not leveraging it enough to build

703
00:42:42,474 --> 00:42:45,977
social communities in different ways that are typical.

704
00:42:46,437 --> 00:42:49,198
So just to sort of give you the take home,

705
00:42:49,218 --> 00:42:51,298
I'm gonna once again list those four lenses

706
00:42:51,758 --> 00:42:53,158
that we really want you to think about

707
00:42:53,259 --> 00:42:55,359
and consider applying to your own projects

708
00:42:55,379 --> 00:42:58,459
and thinking about how these sort of design ideas

709
00:42:58,499 --> 00:42:59,700
fit into your personal space.

710
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,980
So once again, how can I engage a larger audience

711
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,621
by making my experiences asymmetric,

712
00:43:05,981 --> 00:43:07,001
using different devices?

713
00:43:07,061 --> 00:43:08,481
How can somebody on their smartphone

714
00:43:08,501 --> 00:43:11,282
that they have in their pocket interface

715
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:14,462
with an experience that somebody else is seeing

716
00:43:14,503 --> 00:43:15,483
on a high-end VR headset?

717
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:17,844
or a Daydream headset or a Gear VR.

718
00:43:18,964 --> 00:43:23,427
Closely coupled to that, how can I build an audience by considering different modalities of engagement?

719
00:43:23,927 --> 00:43:30,931
So again, VR to phone, VR to AR, you know, think about where that audience is and how we can pull those people in.

720
00:43:31,691 --> 00:43:32,652
Which also includes...

721
00:43:33,492 --> 00:43:37,115
Well, let's go to this one, asynchronous. What's the benefit of allowing my users to engage

722
00:43:37,135 --> 00:43:41,597
with an experience asynchronously? If we want to build viral channels for our VR experiences,

723
00:43:42,378 --> 00:43:46,300
being able to export those experiences to YouTube, a place where we have an audience of

724
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,642
billions, that's going to be an important channel.

725
00:43:49,622 --> 00:43:53,722
And finally, how is your application going to handle abuse? We just can't let this be an

726
00:43:53,802 --> 00:43:59,023
afterthought. So many people are having their first experience in VR today. And if their

727
00:43:59,043 --> 00:44:03,084
experience is a negative one because of a culture of abuse or because it wasn't handled

728
00:44:03,124 --> 00:44:07,125
properly, they're not going to come back for a long time. We need to think about abuse from

729
00:44:07,165 --> 00:44:13,386
the very beginning and make sure that we're prototyping and thinking more broadly and

730
00:44:13,426 --> 00:44:18,187
working hard to answer these questions. And with that, we have about 15 minutes left for Q&A.

731
00:44:20,075 --> 00:44:20,375
Thank you.

732
00:44:29,606 --> 00:44:32,329
It's early and nobody ever jumps up so I'll get this started.

733
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:34,491
So great talk, thanks everybody.

734
00:44:34,911 --> 00:44:40,177
I'm Aaron from Google and my question or comment I guess is directed more toward SIA's area.

735
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:48,061
I've been fascinated and terrified by abuse, like all of us, a little bit for a long time.

736
00:44:48,681 --> 00:44:53,544
I think the problem underlying all of it is the moment we take a conflict-driven approach

737
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:58,566
where we build complex systems to keep people on one side of a wall, doing things that we

738
00:44:58,606 --> 00:45:04,629
approve of, not doing other things, we're actually building a very beautiful complex video game

739
00:45:04,709 --> 00:45:05,229
for trolls.

740
00:45:05,849 --> 00:45:16,464
So the more energy, the more lines in GDDs, and the more lines of code we write to try and block a behavior proactively, you know, beforehand, I kind of feel like that's the struggle we're in.

741
00:45:17,045 --> 00:45:20,530
So it almost feels like we need a completely new way to think about it, other than...

742
00:45:25,471 --> 00:45:27,532
I don't know that there's a question so much as has there

743
00:45:27,552 --> 00:45:30,453
been any thinking in terms of completely new ways of thinking

744
00:45:30,533 --> 00:45:33,913
about it. For example, when you're welcoming someone into

745
00:45:33,953 --> 00:45:37,214
their very first VR experience, when we go out on the street we

746
00:45:37,254 --> 00:45:39,735
know there are certain risks we take, we know there are police

747
00:45:39,795 --> 00:45:43,016
about, we kind of know the rules of that world. I almost feel

748
00:45:43,036 --> 00:45:45,576
like there's an element, like you said, of getting the message

749
00:45:45,696 --> 00:45:49,537
out, hey, this might happen. I feel like we need sort of

750
00:45:49,957 --> 00:45:54,578
completely new modes of thought around it. Do you have any comments or pointers or anything

751
00:45:54,598 --> 00:46:07,101
we can use? Yeah, it's heck and rough. That's no joke. And it is, again, you don't want

752
00:46:07,121 --> 00:46:11,202
to have to build for the harassers. You don't want to build for the lowest common denominator

753
00:46:11,322 --> 00:46:12,642
of people who are going to be rude to each other.

754
00:46:13,703 --> 00:46:16,405
I have seen some other experiments in things that people are doing.

755
00:46:16,665 --> 00:46:20,448
I know AltSpace, I believe High Fidelity does as well, has greeters.

756
00:46:20,488 --> 00:46:24,852
People who will meet you for, like, they have a great team of volunteers

757
00:46:24,912 --> 00:46:27,114
and they sort of leverage the community to sort of, like,

758
00:46:27,394 --> 00:46:28,875
and they give them that responsibility.

759
00:46:28,956 --> 00:46:30,537
So, like, in terms of giving your community...

760
00:46:32,059 --> 00:46:36,744
agency and responsibility to make that community and reinforce those norms themselves. They do

761
00:46:36,784 --> 00:46:40,668
this in the form of greeters who show up and say hello, welcome, are you having problems? Let me

762
00:46:40,708 --> 00:46:44,713
try to help you figure out. Here are some cool things you can do. And leveraging that has been

763
00:46:44,753 --> 00:46:48,938
really useful. Again, I'm really into actually preemptive.

764
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:57,366
sort of experiments in terms of allowing players to sort of customize the social experience that they would like to have before they even

765
00:46:57,906 --> 00:46:58,386
reach into it.

766
00:46:59,387 --> 00:47:04,051
Yes, people are talking about it, but we're still in a super experimental phase.

767
00:47:05,254 --> 00:47:10,958
And I want to remind you also of the video that we had, the video that we showed previously of the YouTube experience.

768
00:47:11,818 --> 00:47:17,002
In that experience, the other people who are in that room with you are on the dock in front of you.

769
00:47:17,602 --> 00:47:19,684
And it leaves very limited room for...

770
00:47:20,624 --> 00:47:25,605
A lot of the categories of abuse that Cy brought up are simply impossible. Bodily and

771
00:47:25,645 --> 00:47:32,027
environmental abuse, they're impossible. This was a design decision that came from

772
00:47:32,167 --> 00:47:36,968
considering abuse from day one. This is exactly what we're talking about when we say you

773
00:47:36,988 --> 00:47:42,849
need to consider abuse from the beginning, design it into it. No one is going to arrive at

774
00:47:42,889 --> 00:47:49,591
that solution by first starting with full six off, head and hands, traditional VR to VR

775
00:47:49,631 --> 00:47:50,171
experiences.

776
00:47:50,912 --> 00:47:54,855
You have to, like that experience was born out of,

777
00:47:55,997 --> 00:47:59,060
like, criteria one, make a,

778
00:48:00,361 --> 00:48:02,463
create a situation where abuse is basically impossible.

779
00:48:03,224 --> 00:48:04,825
And there needs to be a lot more creativity

780
00:48:04,845 --> 00:48:05,406
around that space.

781
00:48:08,863 --> 00:48:14,008
Thank you very much for your enlightening talk. I really appreciate it and I feel there's a lot to learn.

782
00:48:14,569 --> 00:48:21,696
So just following up on that train of thought of having consequences or not letting abuse occur.

783
00:48:23,982 --> 00:48:29,443
Doesn't that restrict freedom as well? For example, right now I could go up to anyone and do weird

784
00:48:29,483 --> 00:48:37,065
gestures. Like I'm not restricted to do that. But right now in VR so far it seems like you're

785
00:48:37,085 --> 00:48:41,747
trying to restrict that. So instead why not create identity like...

786
00:48:43,767 --> 00:48:47,709
I don't know if you've used Steam a lot, but there's a VAC ban.

787
00:48:47,769 --> 00:48:52,771
A VAC ban is usually if you've used cheats or have been hacking in games,

788
00:48:52,811 --> 00:48:55,732
and everybody kind of knows, oh, this guy's a cheater.

789
00:48:55,792 --> 00:49:01,294
So is there like a global identity that's being worked on for VR games,

790
00:49:01,994 --> 00:49:06,136
shared across experiences, or because there's Facebook, Google, and Steam,

791
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:10,557
and it creates a weird issue of how to keep track of all of that.

792
00:49:11,478 --> 00:49:13,880
Yeah, no, that does not currently exist.

793
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,381
It would be incredibly interesting.

794
00:49:16,441 --> 00:49:19,403
So I spent a lot of time in Rec Room.

795
00:49:19,683 --> 00:49:23,825
If I went to High Fidelity and I was being a big old jerk, because that's not where I

796
00:49:23,885 --> 00:49:27,467
usually hang out, so there are minimal consequences, but then I went back to Rec Room and that

797
00:49:27,507 --> 00:49:28,507
reputation followed me.

798
00:49:29,368 --> 00:49:33,551
Maybe I wouldn't go to other social experiences and be a big old jerk.

799
00:49:33,871 --> 00:49:35,873
But that hasn't been talked about right now. That's really hard.

800
00:49:36,033 --> 00:49:43,399
And you're talking about a lot of teams across and various companies working together on this one project.

801
00:49:43,579 --> 00:49:46,261
It'd be interesting. I would really like to see something like that experimented with.

802
00:49:47,689 --> 00:49:54,171
Yeah, I mean, my experience was in the VR's alt room, I think, and it was funny but ridiculous

803
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:58,172
when a guy came up to me and just started yelling in my face, just at the top of his

804
00:49:58,212 --> 00:49:58,473
mic.

805
00:49:58,573 --> 00:50:01,614
It was the most jarring experience.

806
00:50:01,674 --> 00:50:06,255
So it's way worse than, let's say, playing a video game online and then having people

807
00:50:06,755 --> 00:50:07,395
yell and chat. 100%.

808
00:50:07,876 --> 00:50:08,416
Yep.

809
00:50:09,716 --> 00:50:10,336
Thank you very much.

810
00:50:10,536 --> 00:50:10,817
Thank you.

811
00:50:14,904 --> 00:50:16,345
This is also for Sai.

812
00:50:16,365 --> 00:50:17,466
Sorry, guys.

813
00:50:18,587 --> 00:50:19,948
You guys have opinions about abuse, though.

814
00:50:19,968 --> 00:50:21,369
Feel free to just have opinions.

815
00:50:22,906 --> 00:50:33,993
So thanks for that talk. I hadn't thought about the way that I kind of synthesized it in my mind is that you mentioned you as a woman online are harassed in a variety of media.

816
00:50:35,234 --> 00:50:48,502
And now the closer virtual reality gets to real reality, the more we can have this terrible perfect storm of the frequency of online harassment with the impact of in-person harassment, which is a real bad problem.

817
00:50:49,943 --> 00:50:52,384
And so that got me thinking about like,

818
00:50:52,904 --> 00:50:55,505
why is like, maybe I'm wrong about this,

819
00:50:55,605 --> 00:50:57,726
but I would think that real world harassment

820
00:50:58,246 --> 00:51:00,347
might be less frequent or like,

821
00:51:00,607 --> 00:51:02,448
it's obviously they're both huge problems,

822
00:51:02,528 --> 00:51:04,848
but like there might be less frequency

823
00:51:04,868 --> 00:51:06,889
because of like a social contract

824
00:51:06,909 --> 00:51:09,510
or the permanence of consequences of someone like knowing,

825
00:51:10,791 --> 00:51:11,011
you know.

826
00:51:11,491 --> 00:51:19,418
I mean, like, you can, there's cops, there's authorities, there's like, your identity is tied to your like physical presence, right?

827
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,622
I'm wondering if anyone's kind of broken down

828
00:51:24,043 --> 00:51:25,624
sociologically like what that

829
00:51:26,185 --> 00:51:33,451
physical real-world social contract is based on and whether we can have like a super version of it in VR.

830
00:51:33,491 --> 00:51:34,232
Does that make any sense?

831
00:51:34,292 --> 00:51:34,672
Yeah.

832
00:51:35,793 --> 00:51:40,375
Yeah, I spend a lot of time late at night thinking about this stuff because, of course,

833
00:51:40,435 --> 00:51:41,475
I'm going to think about stuff like that.

834
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:42,516
It is different.

835
00:51:42,536 --> 00:51:47,597
It's sort of in the real world, we have the thought of actual consequences happening to

836
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:48,318
an actual person.

837
00:51:49,678 --> 00:51:54,180
In any online environment, there's sort of like a divide between the actual person and

838
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:55,360
how they're represented online.

839
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:58,041
So consequences don't feel quite like they apply to people.

840
00:51:59,182 --> 00:52:05,190
Yeah, ultimately the idea would be how do we sort of reinforce that and bring sort of

841
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:08,554
those structures that exist in the real world into VR.

842
00:52:08,634 --> 00:52:09,755
A lot of it's actually social.

843
00:52:10,256 --> 00:52:15,022
A lot of it actually is, you know, fear of getting caught, it's fear of peers not accepting

844
00:52:15,062 --> 00:52:15,322
this.

845
00:52:15,362 --> 00:52:15,723
Totally.

846
00:52:16,584 --> 00:52:16,724
So.

847
00:52:17,862 --> 00:52:21,443
One of the things that we've seen in a lot of our VR to VR experiments with Daydream Labs

848
00:52:21,884 --> 00:52:26,666
is that because the avatars that we tend to use are very sparse, literally just a floating

849
00:52:26,686 --> 00:52:33,169
head and hands, we have a different physical relationship with that other avatar, the other

850
00:52:33,209 --> 00:52:38,892
person's avatar, and I have seen it over and over again, people completely innocuously

851
00:52:39,452 --> 00:52:44,014
go into their first VR to VR experience and they'll say, oh, what does it feel like when

852
00:52:44,054 --> 00:52:45,095
I stand inside your body?

853
00:52:46,225 --> 00:52:50,947
And I mean, you might laugh, but this is super common for first time VR users if you don't

854
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:53,768
do something to create a negative experience around that.

855
00:52:54,448 --> 00:52:55,689
And it's completely innocent.

856
00:52:55,869 --> 00:52:58,389
It's just like, wow, I've never been able to have this experience before.

857
00:52:58,409 --> 00:52:59,410
What does it look like?

858
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:01,090
Do you see my head clipping through?

859
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:02,271
Where does it start to disappear?

860
00:53:02,291 --> 00:53:02,851
Right, it doesn't hurt.

861
00:53:02,871 --> 00:53:05,772
These are just like engineers who are just like, ah, what are the physical limitations?

862
00:53:05,792 --> 00:53:07,392
Is it going to push me backwards?

863
00:53:07,773 --> 00:53:11,394
They're just querying the physics of that space.

864
00:53:12,234 --> 00:53:14,716
But if the person on the other side isn't ready for that,

865
00:53:14,796 --> 00:53:17,057
it's an incredibly invasive experience.

866
00:53:17,458 --> 00:53:19,899
And so it is going to be more common

867
00:53:20,359 --> 00:53:21,580
unless we do something about it.

868
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:24,282
People do have a different connection to their body

869
00:53:24,662 --> 00:53:25,803
than they do to their avatar.

870
00:53:27,324 --> 00:53:27,504
Cool.

871
00:53:28,045 --> 00:53:28,345
Thank you.

872
00:53:28,845 --> 00:53:29,165
Thank you.

873
00:53:31,596 --> 00:53:37,679
Hi, I'm Andrew from Apple, and this is kind of a question, kind of a comment.

874
00:53:38,759 --> 00:53:44,242
I have children who I like to spend time with, my children obviously, who I like to spend

875
00:53:44,282 --> 00:53:47,684
time with in VR, and I like to introduce them into new VR experiences.

876
00:53:47,904 --> 00:53:52,806
But introducing someone into a VR experience is kind of like debugging a software problem

877
00:53:52,846 --> 00:53:53,467
over the phone.

878
00:53:53,927 --> 00:53:55,488
Like you really have to kind of...

879
00:53:56,168 --> 00:53:59,191
There's no direct agency there to really help them through the experience.

880
00:53:59,231 --> 00:54:04,436
And I would love to introduce my kids to Rec Room, but I'm too worried about just being

881
00:54:04,476 --> 00:54:06,038
able to say, all right, back off.

882
00:54:06,959 --> 00:54:12,244
There's someone along with me that can help me through the experience.

883
00:54:12,344 --> 00:54:14,086
And what I'm getting at is...

884
00:54:15,227 --> 00:54:20,635
Should there be a mechanism to be able to, both considering abuse and asynchronous experiences,

885
00:54:20,675 --> 00:54:25,402
to be able to guide someone, to be able to ride along with someone in VR, and in some

886
00:54:25,422 --> 00:54:29,888
ways to reach out directly and affect or improve their experiences?

887
00:54:30,029 --> 00:54:31,130
Is this something that you've considered?

888
00:54:31,953 --> 00:54:32,733
Yeah, I mean, 100%.

889
00:54:33,873 --> 00:54:36,734
Like, this is something that I would love to see experiments with.

890
00:54:36,814 --> 00:54:40,535
Especially, this kind of falls into a lot of my, and I didn't get to expand on it more,

891
00:54:40,575 --> 00:54:45,616
but about the idea of, for people who aren't immediately harassed, for example, you know,

892
00:54:45,656 --> 00:54:48,897
one of these might be, you know, if you're in with your kids and somebody starts harassing

893
00:54:48,917 --> 00:54:52,358
your kids and you're with them, like, how do you as a parent sort of take charge of

894
00:54:52,398 --> 00:54:53,778
that situation and protect your kids?

895
00:54:55,138 --> 00:54:58,479
These are some of the things that we need a whole lot of experimentation with.

896
00:54:59,252 --> 00:54:59,733
Asynchrony?

897
00:54:59,833 --> 00:55:00,173
You have thoughts?

898
00:55:00,393 --> 00:55:00,613
Yeah.

899
00:55:00,673 --> 00:55:01,874
I mean, Daniel hinted at this.

900
00:55:02,154 --> 00:55:05,816
When we added the mirror window to Google Earth,

901
00:55:06,117 --> 00:55:07,697
everyone was sort of able to follow along.

902
00:55:07,798 --> 00:55:10,059
But there has been a lot of discussion about, well,

903
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:12,420
what if I can point to a place and draw your attention there?

904
00:55:12,781 --> 00:55:14,502
And for a rec room, you can imagine,

905
00:55:14,522 --> 00:55:17,143
if you want to be that chaperone for your child, what

906
00:55:17,163 --> 00:55:20,165
if you have the block controls available for every avatar

907
00:55:20,545 --> 00:55:21,626
right from that mirror window?

908
00:55:21,966 --> 00:55:24,788
And those are exactly the types of asynchronous experiences.

909
00:55:25,669 --> 00:55:28,730
I'm sorry, the asymmetric experiences that we would love to see more of.

910
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:31,791
You know, what if you can, your child can be in a daydream phone,

911
00:55:31,831 --> 00:55:34,652
but you can be following right alongside on your phone

912
00:55:35,272 --> 00:55:38,754
and have a mirror view of what they're seeing here,

913
00:55:38,834 --> 00:55:41,575
but then some controls to control their experience on the other side of your screen.

914
00:55:42,615 --> 00:55:42,735
Yeah.

915
00:55:44,682 --> 00:55:50,525
I think a similar example is the storybook example that we showed, where again it's directly

916
00:55:50,565 --> 00:55:55,568
bringing your kid into a VR experience, which the book we chose is a slightly frightening

917
00:55:55,628 --> 00:55:56,428
book for children.

918
00:55:57,529 --> 00:56:01,310
And the idea being that you can see where the kid is looking, you can see what they're

919
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:05,573
focused on, so if they do get scared, it's pretty easy to talk with them, to pull them

920
00:56:05,693 --> 00:56:08,434
out, to take them back, to navigate them through the space.

921
00:56:09,547 --> 00:56:10,468
Cool, all right, thank you.

922
00:56:10,688 --> 00:56:11,108
Thank you.

923
00:56:11,168 --> 00:56:13,129
That's great ideas, and that's the sort of stuff

924
00:56:13,189 --> 00:56:14,850
I'd love to see people experiment with

925
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:16,130
and try and see what works.

926
00:56:16,651 --> 00:56:17,671
Reminding everyone, of course,

927
00:56:17,731 --> 00:56:21,493
that VR is currently for 13 years old and up.

928
00:56:21,573 --> 00:56:24,274
Yes, 13 years of age and up.

929
00:56:24,294 --> 00:56:26,696
So when you're reading stories to your 13-year-old.

930
00:56:27,036 --> 00:56:30,097
Right.

931
00:56:30,337 --> 00:56:30,978
As one does.

932
00:56:31,358 --> 00:56:33,059
Hi.

933
00:56:34,399 --> 00:56:36,801
So firstly, Rob, I played X for Solo, and it's great.

934
00:56:38,597 --> 00:56:42,320
In fact, I first saw it here at Casual Connect four years ago, I think it was.

935
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:44,441
There you go.

936
00:56:44,781 --> 00:56:45,422
On to the questions.

937
00:56:45,462 --> 00:56:50,225
So I've done a lot of thinking about the asynchronous sort of player in VR as well.

938
00:56:50,765 --> 00:56:54,067
More from the side of like cooperative or competitive gaming.

939
00:56:54,107 --> 00:56:58,149
So you could have a VR player and then a desktop player with a keyboard and mouse if it's a shooter.

940
00:56:58,189 --> 00:57:00,671
Maybe there's people that are on the ground and then people that are flying around.

941
00:57:01,612 --> 00:57:06,054
So, or maybe someone's like on a phone and they're like doing the tower defense and they're placing things.

942
00:57:06,134 --> 00:57:07,595
And the guy at the end of the hour, which is more.

943
00:57:08,099 --> 00:57:09,701
Agile and movement can sort of do different things.

944
00:57:09,721 --> 00:57:11,503
So is there any sort of things you've thought of

945
00:57:11,583 --> 00:57:14,166
at like cooperative or competitive multiplayer?

946
00:57:15,327 --> 00:57:18,610
In asynchronously, that is?

947
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:19,231
What's the question?

948
00:57:19,251 --> 00:57:20,652
Should you be doing more of that stuff?

949
00:57:20,692 --> 00:57:21,713
Hang on, I have a slide for that.

950
00:57:24,777 --> 00:57:25,017
Yes.

951
00:57:27,279 --> 00:57:29,341
Yeah, experiment, awesome, thank you.

952
00:57:29,401 --> 00:57:30,162
I'd love to see your work.

953
00:57:32,196 --> 00:57:39,139
Have you guys done anything with that or any prototyping or looking into anything specific?

954
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:42,061
Do you have a slide for that too?

955
00:57:42,261 --> 00:57:51,265
We have some pretty goofy, I mean we actually took one of the slides out with some of our really really goofy sort of asymmetric games because they were terrible.

956
00:57:52,826 --> 00:57:55,667
Sometimes you have to go down a lot of dead ends to find good stuff.

957
00:57:56,567 --> 00:58:01,508
The lessons that we learned in some of that process is that asymmetric experience is great,

958
00:58:02,289 --> 00:58:07,170
but how do you make the players on both sides feel equally engaged in the experience?

959
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:12,931
How do you balance that? Balance becomes really hard across devices and interfaces.

960
00:58:12,951 --> 00:58:19,213
I mean, already in many cases, they don't let the console players play against the desktop players

961
00:58:19,293 --> 00:58:20,813
because it doesn't seem balanced.

962
00:58:21,593 --> 00:58:25,834
So when you're talking about completely different interfaces and viewpoints, that gets to be an even harder

963
00:58:25,894 --> 00:58:26,255
question.

964
00:58:26,715 --> 00:58:28,017
Right.

965
00:58:28,077 --> 00:58:29,699
Just a slightly different question as well.

966
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:35,906
So Google Earth VR seems like it would be a perfect platform for more social experiences

967
00:58:35,966 --> 00:58:36,307
as well.

968
00:58:36,327 --> 00:58:38,910
Is there anything you're doing taking it in that direction?

969
00:58:39,728 --> 00:58:42,410
I mean, I know we have a ton of G Plus users out there, right?

970
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:46,332
So honestly, it's tough.

971
00:58:47,313 --> 00:58:50,014
Figuring out who's going to win the social space, and

972
00:58:50,054 --> 00:58:53,056
whether we should log into Facebook, and whether you have

973
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:54,397
persistent identities.

974
00:58:55,337 --> 00:58:57,919
Honestly, Google hasn't delved a whole lot into that space

975
00:58:57,959 --> 00:58:58,339
that much.

976
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:00,661
OK, one final question.

977
00:59:00,681 --> 00:59:02,121
It's a little bit off topic, but have you thought about

978
00:59:02,201 --> 00:59:04,883
opening up Google Earth VR as a platform for other

979
00:59:04,903 --> 00:59:06,364
developers to build experiences on?

980
00:59:07,825 --> 00:59:08,765
Come talk to me afterwards.

981
00:59:11,682 --> 00:59:13,124
Okay, we have one more minute.

982
00:59:13,565 --> 00:59:14,906
Oh my God, we're already almost out of time.

983
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:15,467
We're almost out of time.

984
00:59:15,728 --> 00:59:16,408
But give me a question.

985
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:17,129
I want to hear a question.

986
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:17,770
I'll be very quick.

987
00:59:18,431 --> 00:59:22,396
So I had an experience recently regarding abuse where a female co-worker and I were

988
00:59:22,416 --> 00:59:24,499
in a game for a few seconds and we were...

989
00:59:25,112 --> 00:59:29,417
People were grabbing at us like crazy and yeah, but just as I was about to start telling them off

990
00:59:29,537 --> 00:59:35,444
They started talking about what they were doing and the short version is they didn't feel that anybody has a right to any kind

991
00:59:35,484 --> 00:59:41,670
Of bodily integrity in a virtual space and that it shouldn't matter unless they're abusing people in real life after

992
00:59:41,991 --> 00:59:45,575
Practicing it in VR basically. Well, that's certainly an opinion. Yeah

993
00:59:46,738 --> 00:59:50,582
So I was just wondering if you had any experience encountering that particular perspective and

994
00:59:50,902 --> 00:59:53,985
how best to speak to it in dissuading people from behaving that way.

995
00:59:54,406 --> 00:59:57,649
Yeah, I totally absolutely have had that experience.

996
00:59:58,130 --> 00:59:58,850
It is an opinion.

997
01:00:00,752 --> 01:00:03,375
I think that's probably why people, I think that's the root of it, right?

998
01:00:03,415 --> 01:00:05,357
I think that's why people are abusing to begin with.

999
01:00:05,938 --> 01:00:07,740
The people who are engaging in those sorts of behaviors.

1000
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:10,421
Generally would not do so in real life.

1001
01:00:11,041 --> 01:00:14,662
And again, it comes from this idea that the avatar's body is not your own body.

1002
01:00:14,702 --> 01:00:16,383
It's not a real body. It doesn't count.

1003
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:17,383
It's not real.

1004
01:00:17,403 --> 01:00:19,904
If you don't like it, why not you just get out of VR?

1005
01:00:21,024 --> 01:00:23,865
Which I refuse to believe that VR is for the people who are harassing people.

1006
01:00:24,785 --> 01:00:26,245
Just as a standard baseline.

1007
01:00:26,846 --> 01:00:27,886
It's really hard to combat.

1008
01:00:28,466 --> 01:00:31,087
A lot of this has to do, honestly,

1009
01:00:31,707 --> 01:00:34,028
I believe a lot of it has to do with the fact that VR is still so new.

1010
01:00:34,628 --> 01:00:36,670
And that the experiences with VR are still so new.

1011
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:40,433
And a lot of people are equating VR as more similar to video games.

1012
01:00:41,254 --> 01:00:45,758
And not making sort of that divide of like, no, the avatar's body is my own body.

1013
01:00:45,819 --> 01:00:47,060
It represents where I am.

1014
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:52,385
And when you enact in that behavior, to my perspective, it is happening to me and my body.

1015
01:00:52,805 --> 01:00:55,367
I have a sense of proprioception of where my body is.

1016
01:00:55,408 --> 01:00:56,949
And it is exactly where you're grabbing.

1017
01:00:57,089 --> 01:00:58,090
And that's heckin' gross.

1018
01:00:59,351 --> 01:01:05,653
So, I'm hoping in some ways, I'm an optimist generally, so I'm hoping that as VR becomes

1019
01:01:05,713 --> 01:01:11,696
more prevalent and prolific that people start understanding and have more empathy in terms

1020
01:01:11,916 --> 01:01:14,137
of what that experience is like for others.

1021
01:01:15,777 --> 01:01:16,178
Does that help?

1022
01:01:16,478 --> 01:01:17,678
It does, thank you very much.

1023
01:01:20,901 --> 01:01:22,121
Last one, can we do one more?

1024
01:01:22,141 --> 01:01:24,941
Hello, so I'm Ken.

1025
01:01:25,662 --> 01:01:31,383
So speaking of having your own body in VR, what do you think of motion capturing of your

1026
01:01:31,403 --> 01:01:38,944
body in VR instead of just moving a controller and moving stuff around in VR?

1027
01:01:40,265 --> 01:01:43,365
Do you think there's a potential market in that?

1028
01:01:45,296 --> 01:01:45,836
Mocap.

1029
01:01:46,497 --> 01:01:51,318
The line between mocap, it's funny we have like working with academic systems in the

1030
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:58,361
past we have these $150,000 Vicon motion capture systems and now all of a sudden you can buy

1031
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:02,643
your $600 Vive and it does almost as much.

1032
01:02:03,043 --> 01:02:06,764
Sure all you have is head and hands but you can guess the rest of your body and do a pretty

1033
01:02:06,784 --> 01:02:07,144
good job.

1034
01:02:07,985 --> 01:02:12,529
What I'll definitely say about MoCap is that animation system that we showed in one of the videos,

1035
01:02:12,549 --> 01:02:14,110
the really dark video that Daniel was showing,

1036
01:02:16,192 --> 01:02:22,097
the life that you breathe into everything that you touch through your motion feels incredible.

1037
01:02:22,417 --> 01:02:25,901
It really feels like you're giving life to those spaces.

1038
01:02:30,603 --> 01:02:35,089
I don't know quite how to answer the question but there's definitely, I feel like we've

1039
01:02:35,129 --> 01:02:40,956
just made mocap really easy and it's going to be a wonderful thing and we need more people

1040
01:02:41,036 --> 01:02:44,661
to understand and explore the implications of where that's going to go.

1041
01:02:46,826 --> 01:02:50,888
As Rob touched on, I think anything you can do to make the experience feel more human,

1042
01:02:51,208 --> 01:02:54,549
you know, hands and head are great, but anything you can do to sort of put me in.

1043
01:02:54,589 --> 01:03:00,471
Yeah, it helps not only with the experience, but it helps with what the previous questioner asked about,

1044
01:03:00,511 --> 01:03:03,892
which is how can we make people feel more like people, not just avatars?

1045
01:03:04,312 --> 01:03:05,933
How can we help mitigate abuse through that?

1046
01:03:06,413 --> 01:03:07,313
Right. Thank you.

1047
01:03:07,986 --> 01:03:14,772
I want everyone to run an experiment. If you're experiencing a lot of abuse, deliberately recalibrate

1048
01:03:14,792 --> 01:03:18,996
your floor so you're six inches taller than everybody else and see what changes. I don't

1049
01:03:19,036 --> 01:03:21,558
know what it will do but I want people to do this and report back to me.

1050
01:03:23,459 --> 01:03:28,324
You can tweet at us. See, those are our names. Tweet at us your results. I'm really curious.

1051
01:03:29,925 --> 01:03:31,967
And I think that's it. Thanks, everybody, for coming.
