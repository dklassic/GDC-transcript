00:00:06,815 --> 00:00:10,538
Thanks for coming to my talk, a historian's guide to researching your historical game.

2
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:12,159
My name is James Coltrane.

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,463
I'm an assistant professor of history at the University of Nebraska, and I'm also a game

4
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:16,903
developer.

5
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:22,607
I'm currently working as a solo dev on a first-person narrative exploration game called Cassius,

6
00:00:23,067 --> 00:00:27,931
in which players explore an evacuated plantation estate during the American Revolution to confront

7
00:00:27,971 --> 00:00:29,452
our memory of the founding fathers.

8
00:00:29,853 --> 00:00:31,974
and their relationship with colonial slavery.

9
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,835
The game is based closely on historical research,

10
00:00:34,995 --> 00:00:37,616
and every plot point, environment, and object

11
00:00:37,736 --> 00:00:40,857
is based on a documented analog from museums, archives,

12
00:00:40,937 --> 00:00:41,777
and historic sites.

13
00:00:42,497 --> 00:00:44,838
It's not yet formally announced, but if you're interested,

14
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,299
you can see some screens and a draft trailer on my studio

15
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:50,760
site at historiated.com.

16
00:00:52,381 --> 00:00:53,281
Here's just a couple more.

17
00:00:54,334 --> 00:00:54,955
shots of that.

18
00:00:56,035 --> 00:01:00,559
Now of course historical settings have long been popular topics for games and recent years

19
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:01,339
are no exceptions.

20
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,862
So today I want to talk to you a little bit about how you might begin to research your

21
00:01:04,962 --> 00:01:08,965
own historically themed games and I'll use some of my own examples but I'll also talk

22
00:01:09,005 --> 00:01:13,288
about how thinking like a historian as you're researching might give you some really cool

23
00:01:13,368 --> 00:01:15,690
and thought provoking ideas for your game narratives.

24
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,793
It's a lot to do in 30 minutes but you should at least have an idea of how to get started

25
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:20,493
once we're done.

26
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:24,495
But first, let's talk a little bit about the way that history works.

27
00:01:25,215 --> 00:01:30,357
Sometimes we tend to think that the past is very set and established, only occasionally

28
00:01:30,437 --> 00:01:31,598
updated with new discoveries.

29
00:01:32,238 --> 00:01:34,759
But in reality, history is very messy right from the beginning.

30
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,741
If you look at any claim made in a normal textbook, the evidence often begins to look

31
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:44,963
more like this, a messy pile of garbage, which historians must then piece together to construct

32
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:46,503
a narrative of what happened.

33
00:01:47,184 --> 00:01:50,348
So this leads us to some key principles about the way history works.

34
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:53,692
The first is that history is not the truth.

35
00:01:54,473 --> 00:01:55,775
We are only following traces.

36
00:01:56,275 --> 00:02:00,361
And even if we could get inside the mind of a historical witness, this still wouldn't

37
00:02:00,401 --> 00:02:04,025
be the truth because other people would have experienced the moment differently.

38
00:02:05,206 --> 00:02:11,152
Second, history is a discussion, and that's because every historian who looks at the same

39
00:02:11,212 --> 00:02:13,834
pile of garbage is going to draw different conclusions.

40
00:02:14,795 --> 00:02:19,779
Finally, history is always changing because each generation of historians will view their

41
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:21,000
garbage piles differently.

42
00:02:22,361 --> 00:02:26,004
For instance, historians in the early 20th century would have rated Andrew Jackson as

43
00:02:26,044 --> 00:02:30,148
one of our best presidents for his military victories and his role in expanding democracy.

44
00:02:30,668 --> 00:02:34,311
while contemporary ones rightly criticize him for his slave

45
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:35,993
holding and role in the Trail of Tears,

46
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,515
leaving room for other alternatives.

47
00:02:38,736 --> 00:02:43,080
There's Andrew Jackson, proposed Harriet Tubman $20 bill.

48
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,120
OK.

49
00:02:45,146 --> 00:02:47,129
Let's talk a little bit about how to structure your research.

50
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,632
When you're choosing a topic, it's

51
00:02:49,672 --> 00:02:51,735
important to lean on the work that historians have already

52
00:02:51,775 --> 00:02:52,216
done for you.

53
00:02:52,736 --> 00:02:54,599
There's no shame in focusing on topics

54
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:55,881
with accessible resources.

55
00:02:56,121 --> 00:02:57,903
And historians often make the same choice

56
00:02:57,963 --> 00:02:59,305
when we're choosing our own projects.

57
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:00,307
For instance.

58
00:03:00,927 --> 00:03:05,429
I chose Eastern Virginia for the setting of my game, Cassius, in part because I could

59
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:09,671
draw on the expertise of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, where I had a research fellowship,

60
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:15,094
and learn from the restored buildings, an ample library, and hundreds of expert interpreters.

61
00:03:15,874 --> 00:03:17,655
This is especially true for visual evidence.

62
00:03:17,895 --> 00:03:21,797
If people have already reconstructed the settings you're interested in at museum exhibits or

63
00:03:21,817 --> 00:03:24,378
for documentaries, this can save you a ton of time.

64
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:28,621
It's also important to remember that just like in other aspects of game design,

65
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:31,623
your research is going to be an iterative process.

66
00:03:32,144 --> 00:03:34,385
So remember, you'll likely be skipping back and forth

67
00:03:34,445 --> 00:03:36,307
between the next few steps that I'm going to go through.

68
00:03:37,328 --> 00:03:40,310
And you're going to have new ideas, which point you to new evidence,

69
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,831
and then back to new ideas.

70
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,329
So if we're looking for a place to start,

71
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:47,070
getting your hands on a broad, accessible book

72
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,711
from a reliable scholar is a pretty good first step.

73
00:03:50,311 --> 00:03:51,991
For instance, when I wanted an introduction

74
00:03:52,051 --> 00:03:54,532
into Aztec culture for one of my history lectures,

75
00:03:54,932 --> 00:03:57,372
this short, sweet book by archaeologist Michael Smith

76
00:03:57,752 --> 00:03:59,793
succinctly covered almost every aspect.

77
00:04:00,853 --> 00:04:02,173
But how do we know that what we're reading

78
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:04,554
is reliable and not absurdist pseudo-history?

79
00:04:05,694 --> 00:04:10,999
Well, Good History works under peer review, where before publication, other expert historians

80
00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:16,664
critique a draft, which offers some insurance against fraudulent or other unreliable interpretations.

81
00:04:17,305 --> 00:04:19,627
Books from university presses are all peer reviewed.

82
00:04:20,287 --> 00:04:23,851
And you can just see also if you have a book that's not from a university press, if it's

83
00:04:23,871 --> 00:04:29,255
been blurbed or positively reviewed by working historians, or if it's connected to an established

84
00:04:29,275 --> 00:04:31,077
museum or a government agency.

85
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:36,133
Once you've read broadly in a book or two, you should be full of ideas and also topics

86
00:04:36,173 --> 00:04:37,693
that you'd like to investigate further.

87
00:04:38,294 --> 00:04:40,395
So now's our time to start gathering sources.

88
00:04:41,095 --> 00:04:43,596
Historians divide our sources into two types.

89
00:04:43,937 --> 00:04:49,359
Primary sources, which are things like diaries, letters, records, interviews, maps, photographs,

90
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:54,022
but also artifacts, art, and architecture that come directly from the period that we're

91
00:04:54,062 --> 00:04:54,402
studying.

92
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:59,584
For instance, this slave pass that featured in the research of my game,

93
00:04:59,704 --> 00:05:03,406
and also this map of the area surrounding Williamsburg,

94
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:06,287
both of which were featured nearby in Virginia.

95
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:10,528
And of course, you're also going to use a lot of secondary sources.

96
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:14,050
These are things like books and articles by historians and other scholars

97
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,631
who interpret primary sources and draw their own conclusions.

98
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,473
And there are some things like a historical newspaper,

99
00:05:20,773 --> 00:05:22,273
which actually qualify as both.

100
00:05:23,534 --> 00:05:27,118
Secondary sources are pretty easy to come by via your book's bibliographies,

101
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:29,060
but there may be a lot to process.

102
00:05:29,361 --> 00:05:30,402
So a couple of tips.

103
00:05:30,942 --> 00:05:36,068
First, even just looking at the recommended books that come up on Amazon or some other site

104
00:05:36,608 --> 00:05:39,251
can give you a pretty good indication of important books in your field,

105
00:05:39,391 --> 00:05:42,154
especially if you're already starting out with a respected title.

106
00:05:43,136 --> 00:05:48,302
Also, Google Scholar is a very useful tool because it can show you the most cited books

107
00:05:48,442 --> 00:05:52,346
in your topic and that can give you a sense of both the reliability of the scholarship

108
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:55,089
and also how prominent the interpretations you're considering are.

109
00:05:56,371 --> 00:05:58,773
Primary sources, on the other hand, are going to take more effort.

110
00:05:59,374 --> 00:06:01,556
The most obvious place to find original documents

111
00:06:01,636 --> 00:06:04,258
is to actually visit the archives and the libraries

112
00:06:04,278 --> 00:06:05,199
that have the originals.

113
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:07,421
But that's a lot to ask of a busy developer.

114
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,423
Instead, you can start in your bibliographies

115
00:06:10,563 --> 00:06:12,525
and see which manuscript collections were

116
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,988
used in writing the book and look up those archives online.

117
00:06:16,828 --> 00:06:19,230
Many are going to have the actual documents available

118
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:19,670
to read.

119
00:06:21,452 --> 00:06:24,795
And in some cases, this will be available completely for free.

120
00:06:24,815 --> 00:06:26,396
So here's that pass that I showed again.

121
00:06:26,456 --> 00:06:28,758
You can view directly on the Williamsburg website.

122
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:34,574
In addition, bibliographies will also show published primary sources,

123
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:39,577
like collections of letters, and even books and other print media from your period.

124
00:06:40,278 --> 00:06:43,260
These are available in public domain and many of them complete online,

125
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,122
like this collection of Thomas Jefferson's letters.

126
00:06:45,902 --> 00:06:50,426
Some great sites to check for these types of public sources include archive.org

127
00:06:50,906 --> 00:06:54,429
and the Digital Public Library of America, and even in some cases, Google Books.

128
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:56,551
There's the Digital Public Library of America.

129
00:06:57,231 --> 00:07:01,292
For Cassius, I found many complete digital copies of books that were actually owned by

130
00:07:01,332 --> 00:07:05,354
George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, like this gardening manual, which was available

131
00:07:05,434 --> 00:07:06,934
complete and for free online.

132
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:11,476
Additionally, you can search for modern primary source collections targeted to high school

133
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:12,376
or college students.

134
00:07:13,336 --> 00:07:17,498
You also want to visit the websites of the relevant historic sites and museums for visual

135
00:07:17,558 --> 00:07:17,898
evidence.

136
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:22,637
The online collections at the Williamsburg Museum have been invaluable for me in making Cassius,

137
00:07:23,118 --> 00:07:26,342
and many incredibly important museums, like the Metropolitan Museum of Art,

138
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:28,625
the Art Institute of Chicago, and the British Museum,

139
00:07:28,986 --> 00:07:34,093
have nearly their complete collections viewable online, sometimes with royalty-free images.

140
00:07:35,072 --> 00:07:38,713
In addition to these sources, you're going to want to get help from experts.

141
00:07:39,874 --> 00:07:43,235
So there are two broad categories of historians who can potentially help you.

142
00:07:43,955 --> 00:07:48,637
Scholarly historians, like me, are mostly university professors, and these are people

143
00:07:48,657 --> 00:07:52,678
who are actively trying to produce totally new interpretations and discoveries based

144
00:07:52,758 --> 00:07:53,599
on original research.

145
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:56,140
So they probably won't be able to fact-check your game.

146
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,580
And in some cases, they may know even less than you do about some of your topics.

147
00:08:01,161 --> 00:08:07,742
However, because academics are in the habit of extrapolating very large themes from their

148
00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:11,303
areas of original research, they're going to be very good for helping you with things

149
00:08:11,423 --> 00:08:17,784
like politics, economics, empire, religion, race, gender, and especially also debates

150
00:08:17,824 --> 00:08:20,944
and controversies that may be happening in the academic field that you're going to want

151
00:08:20,965 --> 00:08:21,525
to be aware of.

152
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:25,787
The other kind of expert that you'll be looking for are public historians,

153
00:08:26,307 --> 00:08:29,568
and these can include archivists, museum officials, park rangers,

154
00:08:29,929 --> 00:08:33,490
anybody else who's tasked with preserving and educating the public about history.

155
00:08:34,131 --> 00:08:38,093
These are experts who are likely to be able to tell you about the everyday life in your period.

156
00:08:38,693 --> 00:08:42,357
And these days, even bloggers, YouTubers, and Pinterest boards can be helpful,

157
00:08:42,777 --> 00:08:44,239
and sometimes even pretty reliable.

158
00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:46,521
For instance, Townsend & Sons,

159
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:49,564
a company that makes props for American Revolution reenactors,

160
00:08:49,944 --> 00:08:53,348
runs an awesome YouTube channel on 18th century life and cooking.

161
00:08:53,528 --> 00:08:58,593
And yes, this is where you can get all your pressing earthen ovens questions answered.

162
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:04,437
And even though he isn't a professional historian, he routinely cites peer-reviewed scholars,

163
00:09:04,537 --> 00:09:07,979
primary documents, and also collaborates with public history officials.

164
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,141
Now a few pieces of advice when you're reaching out to experts.

165
00:09:13,442 --> 00:09:18,305
First, do as much research as you can, especially about the expert in question, before you make

166
00:09:18,345 --> 00:09:18,825
contact.

167
00:09:19,365 --> 00:09:23,168
Look up their books and articles, and go on YouTube and see if they have any lectures,

168
00:09:23,408 --> 00:09:26,509
so that if they give you the time, you're not asking about things that you could have

169
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:27,410
easily learned yourself.

170
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,592
Second, ease them into the idea of your game.

171
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:32,534
If somebody looks particularly cranky,

172
00:09:32,554 --> 00:09:34,575
maybe don't even say game in that first email.

173
00:09:36,216 --> 00:09:38,578
Lots of experts may not know how far games have come

174
00:09:38,698 --> 00:09:40,099
as a serious storytelling medium,

175
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,641
and they may need a few quick examples

176
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,123
to know that you're not doing something totally trivial.

177
00:09:46,024 --> 00:09:51,066
Also, keep in mind that the most famous experts may not always be as useful as young up-and-coming

178
00:09:51,106 --> 00:09:56,409
scholars who may be more open to sharing and possibly be more up-to-date on recent discoveries.

179
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:01,251
You can find these experts by looking through your list of secondary authors on the websites

180
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:05,253
of public history institutions and also by looking through the faculty pages of your

181
00:10:05,273 --> 00:10:06,093
local universities.

182
00:10:07,884 --> 00:10:12,228
Finally, if you're a bigger studio, paying a small consulting fee can go a long way.

183
00:10:12,989 --> 00:10:18,173
Also, be prepared and respectful if the expert isn't enthusiastic about your game, and make

184
00:10:18,213 --> 00:10:21,736
sure to credit them, but only after you've allowed them to see the final project and

185
00:10:21,756 --> 00:10:23,518
make sure they want their name associated with it.

186
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,702
Now one important way that experts can help you

187
00:10:31,202 --> 00:10:32,883
is in dealing with cultural sensitivity.

188
00:10:33,364 --> 00:10:35,925
And now of course, we don't have time in such a short talk

189
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:38,227
to adequately cover very complicated issues

190
00:10:38,287 --> 00:10:41,469
like representation, diversity, and cultural appropriation,

191
00:10:41,669 --> 00:10:42,770
but a few points of advice.

192
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,312
First, pitch your idea early to as many experts

193
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:48,374
from as many different backgrounds as you can

194
00:10:48,794 --> 00:10:49,955
and get their gut reactions.

195
00:10:50,575 --> 00:10:53,819
If they're critical at first, but you still feel really confident in your concept,

196
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,843
you can try again once you've put together mock-ups or prototypes,

197
00:10:57,263 --> 00:10:59,366
but you need to take their advice seriously.

198
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:03,811
Also, it's really important to talk with people who have different sets of expertise.

199
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,956
Your game design peers may have very culturally thoughtful suggestions that...

200
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,450
for your game that don't actually turn out

201
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:13,550
to be historically accurate.

202
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:15,691
And while the historians should be able to help you

203
00:11:15,731 --> 00:11:17,251
do justice to past subjects,

204
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:19,132
they may have game design ideas

205
00:11:19,192 --> 00:11:21,152
that are either artistically unworkable

206
00:11:21,252 --> 00:11:22,593
or even clumsy and offensive

207
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:24,093
when you actually put them into practice.

208
00:11:24,753 --> 00:11:26,994
You'll need to get a lot of feedback from a lot of people

209
00:11:27,434 --> 00:11:30,094
and use your own judgment to balance all of that input.

210
00:11:31,755 --> 00:11:33,495
So now that you've gathered a lot of evidence

211
00:11:33,895 --> 00:11:35,236
and you have people to help guide you,

212
00:11:35,496 --> 00:11:38,056
let's talk about how we actually interpret that evidence.

213
00:11:38,838 --> 00:11:42,079
First of all, no matter how silly or weird your game idea,

214
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:44,920
I always encourage everyone to read at least a little bit

215
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,121
from primary records of that period.

216
00:11:47,621 --> 00:11:49,761
In my experience, nothing is going to spark

217
00:11:49,801 --> 00:11:52,402
your imagination faster or show you the weirder side

218
00:11:52,422 --> 00:11:55,043
of your topic quicker than reading directly from the past.

219
00:11:55,763 --> 00:11:57,584
But we also need to keep in mind some principles

220
00:11:57,644 --> 00:11:59,444
to help us evaluate what we're reading.

221
00:12:00,045 --> 00:12:02,465
First, we need to remember that if our documents

222
00:12:02,525 --> 00:12:04,686
are sometimes, that our documents are sometimes

223
00:12:04,726 --> 00:12:07,307
going to contradict one another, or just not make sense.

224
00:12:07,907 --> 00:12:09,829
And we're going to have to use our secondary sources

225
00:12:09,869 --> 00:12:12,651
and our expert advice to try to figure out what they mean

226
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:13,752
or which are more accurate.

227
00:12:14,413 --> 00:12:15,914
And when we consider a given document,

228
00:12:16,214 --> 00:12:18,897
we want to think about the biases that every author has.

229
00:12:19,797 --> 00:12:22,300
And not just whether or not they're being honest with us,

230
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,803
but broader questions like, why is the author even writing this?

231
00:12:26,023 --> 00:12:27,164
Who are they writing it for?

232
00:12:27,344 --> 00:12:28,925
What does that audience expect of them?

233
00:12:29,506 --> 00:12:31,728
How does the author's identity affect what they're saying?

234
00:12:32,248 --> 00:12:33,789
What societal pressures are on them

235
00:12:33,849 --> 00:12:34,970
to say things a certain way?

236
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:39,044
There are also biases that are present in the documents themselves.

237
00:12:39,904 --> 00:12:41,005
One is survival bias.

238
00:12:41,605 --> 00:12:44,647
This means that the more likely a kind of document is to survive,

239
00:12:45,087 --> 00:12:48,449
the more disproportionate influence it will have on our record of the past.

240
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,311
A great example of this is Neolithic cave art.

241
00:12:52,211 --> 00:12:54,133
Most prehistoric people lived outdoors.

242
00:12:54,713 --> 00:12:58,515
But because the objects they left in caves are much more likely to survive until today,

243
00:12:58,996 --> 00:13:03,698
we give them such outsized attention that the public often refers to these people colloquially as cavemen.

244
00:13:04,712 --> 00:13:07,433
Another important bias to watch is for document bias.

245
00:13:08,193 --> 00:13:09,954
If the only records you have from a town

246
00:13:10,034 --> 00:13:11,975
are from the church, you may be tempted

247
00:13:12,015 --> 00:13:14,476
to overstate the importance of religion in daily life

248
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:17,458
because that's all those documents are intended to tell you.

249
00:13:18,408 --> 00:13:20,849
Let's look at an example of an excellent primary source.

250
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:25,832
One of the most valuable kinds of documents for my game Cassius and for the history of

251
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:30,615
slavery overall are newspaper advertisements for escaped slaves, like this one placed by

252
00:13:30,655 --> 00:13:31,456
Thomas Jefferson.

253
00:13:32,056 --> 00:13:36,539
From these short ads, we can extrapolate all kinds of details that we wouldn't otherwise

254
00:13:36,599 --> 00:13:41,722
have about enslaved people's daily lives, including their diet, clothing, health.

255
00:13:42,082 --> 00:13:45,984
family structure, names, spoken languages, ethnic backgrounds,

256
00:13:46,405 --> 00:13:49,326
personal properties, punishments, skills, and more.

257
00:13:50,547 --> 00:13:53,928
But the ads are obviously subject to significant biases.

258
00:13:54,489 --> 00:13:57,971
First, they're completely limited to only things masters knew

259
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,592
about these people and wanted to share in public.

260
00:14:01,152 --> 00:14:02,933
But second, we also have a document bias,

261
00:14:03,473 --> 00:14:05,695
and that's the generalizations that we make from them

262
00:14:05,955 --> 00:14:08,236
may only really apply to slaves who run away,

263
00:14:08,656 --> 00:14:10,537
rather than the broader group of enslaved people.

264
00:14:11,736 --> 00:14:14,337
It's important for us to think about how we interpret evidence

265
00:14:14,798 --> 00:14:17,479
because when we recreate a historical world in our game,

266
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:20,361
we're actually creating our own historic interpretation.

267
00:14:21,021 --> 00:14:23,562
So let's talk a little bit about the issue of accuracy.

268
00:14:24,283 --> 00:14:27,144
A lot of game designers get excited about a quote unquote

269
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:28,805
hardcore approach to realism.

270
00:14:29,516 --> 00:14:32,698
This instinct is already common to war games and survival games,

271
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:34,740
and sometimes that mentality carries over

272
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,800
into history-themed games.

273
00:14:36,581 --> 00:14:38,903
But while this might work for little details like sword

274
00:14:38,943 --> 00:14:40,704
pommels or dress floral patterns,

275
00:14:41,144 --> 00:14:44,086
these aspirations usually break down and prove insufficient

276
00:14:44,487 --> 00:14:47,028
once we start trying to depict effectively larger

277
00:14:47,108 --> 00:14:48,429
social and cultural realities.

278
00:14:49,134 --> 00:14:51,916
And of course, complete accuracy is impossible.

279
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,597
And that should be obvious to us,

280
00:14:54,097 --> 00:14:55,838
as shown in this classic Onion video,

281
00:14:55,918 --> 00:14:58,320
satirizing a super realistic Iraq War game

282
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,821
where you sit bored for eight hours fixing trucks.

283
00:15:01,982 --> 00:15:05,184
Thus, even the quote unquote super realistic games

284
00:15:05,284 --> 00:15:06,905
have to make a lot of compromises

285
00:15:06,945 --> 00:15:08,806
to be anything somebody is going to want to play.

286
00:15:10,404 --> 00:15:13,388
There are also different kinds of accuracy that we can consider.

287
00:15:14,108 --> 00:15:17,052
Sometimes it may make sense to choose accuracy in tone

288
00:15:17,352 --> 00:15:20,976
rather than accuracy in detail, be it using an EDM track

289
00:15:21,377 --> 00:15:24,140
for a decadent Roman feast instead of the possibly

290
00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:27,404
shrill and unfamiliar ancient music that actually would have played.

291
00:15:28,105 --> 00:15:30,750
or skipping the exhaustive Elizabethan pleasantries,

292
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:33,515
not to mention all the things we'd have a hard time depicting,

293
00:15:33,575 --> 00:15:36,461
the accents, the cadences, the unfamiliar vocabulary

294
00:15:36,921 --> 00:15:40,047
that might slow NPC dialogue to a crawl.

295
00:15:41,204 --> 00:15:43,025
But that doesn't mean that we have to abandon

296
00:15:43,085 --> 00:15:44,986
deep historical engagement just because we're

297
00:15:45,006 --> 00:15:47,407
willing to make some sacrifices in the name of making

298
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,348
our games more playable.

299
00:15:49,008 --> 00:15:51,529
Despite interdimensional travel and robotic songbirds,

300
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:53,690
Bioshock Infinite directly engages

301
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:56,632
with 19th century immigration, racism, and colonialism.

302
00:15:57,132 --> 00:15:59,273
And even though there is a very, very fierce debate

303
00:15:59,453 --> 00:16:02,174
over its success in dealing with these topics,

304
00:16:03,235 --> 00:16:06,196
it makes much more of an effort than the supposedly sturdy

305
00:16:06,356 --> 00:16:06,856
Oregon Trail.

306
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,501
which significantly overlooks the presence

307
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,982
of Native Americans, themes of colonialism,

308
00:16:12,022 --> 00:16:13,623
and all kinds of other important elements.

309
00:16:14,444 --> 00:16:16,345
More recently, the return of the Obra Dinn

310
00:16:16,885 --> 00:16:19,146
mixed fantastical horror elements

311
00:16:19,607 --> 00:16:22,408
with a great deal of pretty accurate daily life

312
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:23,789
from 19th century sailing,

313
00:16:24,169 --> 00:16:25,670
including a really excellent portrayal

314
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,991
of maritime diversity.

315
00:16:28,332 --> 00:16:30,393
Another way that accuracy comes into play

316
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,394
is when you're dealing with historical myths.

317
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:34,996
There are plenty of pop culture bubbles to burst.

318
00:16:35,815 --> 00:16:37,215
Napoleon wasn't really that short.

319
00:16:38,016 --> 00:16:39,797
Vikings didn't really have horns on their helmets.

320
00:16:40,437 --> 00:16:42,258
And Paul Revere never said the British are coming

321
00:16:42,298 --> 00:16:43,619
because he was the British.

322
00:16:44,939 --> 00:16:47,441
Your commitment to accuracy will help you decide

323
00:16:47,481 --> 00:16:49,982
whether you're going to affirm or dispel myths.

324
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,303
And some of these may just be fun to play with

325
00:16:52,743 --> 00:16:53,404
with your audience.

326
00:16:54,144 --> 00:16:56,228
You do, however, need to think about which tropes,

327
00:16:56,688 --> 00:17:00,114
like, say, the common one of Columbus as a historic explorer,

328
00:17:00,675 --> 00:17:03,380
may actually be covering up for historic abuses,

329
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:08,047
and whether or not it's desirable to perpetuate those even in a less serious game.

330
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:12,387
And of course, no matter how seriously we take the issue

331
00:17:12,427 --> 00:17:15,268
of historical accuracy, your research

332
00:17:15,388 --> 00:17:17,668
is going to provide you with a lot of rich content

333
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:19,749
to drive your storytelling and your design.

334
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:22,170
So let's take a little time to consider

335
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,311
how thinking like a historian can help your game.

336
00:17:25,071 --> 00:17:25,971
Let's start with characters.

337
00:17:26,631 --> 00:17:28,912
It's a common maxim to say that each character should

338
00:17:28,932 --> 00:17:30,413
be the hero of their own story.

339
00:17:30,953 --> 00:17:32,853
And heroes have goals that they want to achieve.

340
00:17:33,373 --> 00:17:35,174
And while lots of human aspirations,

341
00:17:35,294 --> 00:17:38,375
like love and success and family and creative expression,

342
00:17:39,897 --> 00:17:44,321
are relatively universal, how your character seeks out those things

343
00:17:44,761 --> 00:17:46,803
is going to be radically different period to period.

344
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:52,569
You'll want to know how common important modern categories of identity,

345
00:17:52,709 --> 00:17:54,650
like race, class, and gender were expressed,

346
00:17:55,071 --> 00:17:57,453
which sometimes may be very, very different than the present.

347
00:17:58,053 --> 00:18:01,296
For instance, let me present you with a very manly portrait

348
00:18:01,336 --> 00:18:03,078
of George Washington from the 18th century.

349
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,222
even though his curvy body, relaxed posture, and frilly clothing

350
00:18:07,362 --> 00:18:09,604
might signal femininity to some people in the present.

351
00:18:10,204 --> 00:18:13,326
In his day, manliness was expressed by the ease and grace

352
00:18:13,386 --> 00:18:15,868
powerful people had when they had command over others,

353
00:18:16,348 --> 00:18:19,310
including the people he owned, unfortunately.

354
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,292
You also want to pay attention to other categories

355
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:25,214
that may be more important in the past than they are today.

356
00:18:25,555 --> 00:18:27,836
Depending on the area, this could include things like

357
00:18:28,237 --> 00:18:32,219
religious identity, imperial affiliation, tribe, language group.

358
00:18:32,914 --> 00:18:37,097
For instance, it may be hard to imagine a Baptist and a Methodist coming to blows today

359
00:18:37,177 --> 00:18:42,402
over their theological differences, but that was a real possibility at certain periods

360
00:18:42,442 --> 00:18:42,942
in the past.

361
00:18:44,464 --> 00:18:48,708
Your research will also enrich the setting and the environmental design incredibly.

362
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:52,951
Two great questions to be asking over and over again as you learn about past spaces

363
00:18:53,152 --> 00:18:55,494
are, number one, why is this here?

364
00:18:56,174 --> 00:18:58,076
And number two, how did this get here?

365
00:18:58,817 --> 00:19:01,758
The why is going to tell you not only about practical demands,

366
00:19:02,298 --> 00:19:05,080
the way that societies manage resources and concerns

367
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,781
like water, transportation, shelter, security,

368
00:19:08,401 --> 00:19:10,082
but also their symbolic priorities.

369
00:19:11,103 --> 00:19:12,883
Why did they build in a particular place?

370
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,584
Why did they build in the style they did?

371
00:19:14,644 --> 00:19:16,245
Why did they decorate in the style they did?

372
00:19:17,005 --> 00:19:19,026
The how question is also very important

373
00:19:19,427 --> 00:19:21,768
because it's going to reveal how things like agriculture,

374
00:19:21,908 --> 00:19:25,649
technology, and economies work, but especially how money

375
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,110
and labor help produce spaces.

376
00:19:28,004 --> 00:19:30,566
The secret pirate towns of Uncharted 4, for instance,

377
00:19:31,267 --> 00:19:33,769
show a ton of attention to 18th century architecture

378
00:19:33,869 --> 00:19:36,871
that reflects a lot of careful thinking about the why.

379
00:19:38,232 --> 00:19:40,314
But the how is a little bit hardly established.

380
00:19:40,754 --> 00:19:42,415
I mean, who in these secret pirate towns

381
00:19:42,475 --> 00:19:43,896
is paying for hundreds of sculptors

382
00:19:43,956 --> 00:19:46,518
to produce decades of work on all of these statues?

383
00:19:47,499 --> 00:19:49,861
These pirates were very committed to public art.

384
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:51,102
Yeah.

385
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:53,864
So here's some of their statues.

386
00:19:55,064 --> 00:20:00,507
In my own game, balancing the questions of scale, architectural style, natural light,

387
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:04,968
and other practical concerns in the design of the main house not only made my environmental

388
00:20:04,988 --> 00:20:10,131
design more accurate, but taught me a lot about how the characters, enslaved and free,

389
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,851
inhabited and lived in this house.

390
00:20:13,372 --> 00:20:16,093
Here's a little bit of that house exterior.

391
00:20:17,654 --> 00:20:18,214
And of course...

392
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:21,351
What you learn about the past is going to impact a way

393
00:20:21,691 --> 00:20:24,011
of what you think is possible for your narrative arcs

394
00:20:24,132 --> 00:20:24,752
and plot threads.

395
00:20:25,352 --> 00:20:28,032
I found a useful exercise to think about is

396
00:20:28,152 --> 00:20:30,073
what sort of stories are only possible

397
00:20:30,193 --> 00:20:31,413
in your historical moment?

398
00:20:32,053 --> 00:20:34,534
For instance, think of a typical mission quest

399
00:20:34,574 --> 00:20:35,554
in an open world game.

400
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:38,495
If your game is set like Assassin's Creed Origins

401
00:20:38,535 --> 00:20:40,775
in ancient Egypt, could this same mission

402
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:41,635
fit into The Witcher?

403
00:20:41,815 --> 00:20:43,556
And these are things like, find my dog.

404
00:20:44,856 --> 00:20:46,216
Could it fit into Grand Theft Auto?

405
00:20:47,574 --> 00:20:51,555
Or, when you think about the beliefs and pressures and priorities of your characters,

406
00:20:51,915 --> 00:20:54,336
what sorts of stories could only happen in your period?

407
00:20:54,876 --> 00:20:56,816
These may end up being some of the most interesting.

408
00:20:57,877 --> 00:20:59,497
There are a lot of other questions we can ask.

409
00:21:00,857 --> 00:21:05,359
People often critique horror movies and say that all of the tension would dissipate

410
00:21:05,379 --> 00:21:07,739
in a particular moment if someone only had cell service.

411
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,301
What stories are possible in worlds that exist long before electricity or printing?

412
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:15,270
How does resource management in your game change

413
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:17,311
when a drink of water means a five mile walk?

414
00:21:17,932 --> 00:21:19,552
How does inventory management change

415
00:21:19,592 --> 00:21:22,574
when objects like silver buttons are relatively commonplace,

416
00:21:22,954 --> 00:21:24,775
but paper sheets remain expensive?

417
00:21:25,556 --> 00:21:27,216
Just by learning how to light a candle

418
00:21:27,316 --> 00:21:29,738
using an 18th century tinderbox from my own game

419
00:21:30,098 --> 00:21:31,439
had all kinds of ramifications

420
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:33,059
about how I might manage light,

421
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,401
which bled over into level design

422
00:21:35,481 --> 00:21:37,382
and even elements of story tension.

423
00:21:38,873 --> 00:21:45,157
And finally, while a lot of historical games concentrate on trying to reconstruct past events and spaces literally,

424
00:21:45,177 --> 00:21:51,941
I think there's an exciting opportunity to start trying to represent past mentalities, worldviews, religious beliefs, and cosmologies.

425
00:21:52,662 --> 00:21:56,984
That is to say, to try to make our players feel the way historical people did in a place,

426
00:21:57,385 --> 00:22:00,947
or see historical scenes the way that historical actors did.

427
00:22:01,527 --> 00:22:02,028
For instance...

428
00:22:02,687 --> 00:22:07,529
We in the present may be tempted to view a medieval chapel cathedral as having a timeless

429
00:22:07,649 --> 00:22:13,391
ethereal mystique, when period visitors may have viewed it more like this, thinking the

430
00:22:13,411 --> 00:22:19,854
patronage was tacky or crass, to say nothing of how modern Assassin's Creed players view

431
00:22:19,914 --> 00:22:22,295
it.

432
00:22:22,315 --> 00:22:27,337
Or for another interesting example, consider the ancient Egyptians, who in using hieroglyphs

433
00:22:27,377 --> 00:22:29,598
had no formal distinction between writing and art.

434
00:22:30,524 --> 00:22:32,005
That meant to literate Egyptians,

435
00:22:32,586 --> 00:22:36,729
this could be writing, as could this, but also this.

436
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:41,133
But even seemingly decorative items like this pectoral

437
00:22:41,313 --> 00:22:45,156
from King Tutankhamun could also be writing, in this case,

438
00:22:45,196 --> 00:22:47,318
incorporating the hieroglyphs from his throne name,

439
00:22:47,898 --> 00:22:50,620
as you can see, both having the sun disk, the scarab,

440
00:22:50,961 --> 00:22:51,942
and the basket glyphs.

441
00:22:52,842 --> 00:22:55,183
This means that scenes that appear wholly pictorial

442
00:22:55,223 --> 00:22:58,384
to a modern audience, some Egyptians would have looked at

443
00:22:58,484 --> 00:23:01,265
and heard letter sounds and saw words

444
00:23:01,445 --> 00:23:02,565
as they looked at these images.

445
00:23:03,165 --> 00:23:05,586
And these are the types of very core cultural differences

446
00:23:05,626 --> 00:23:08,146
that could be really exciting to capture in a game.

447
00:23:09,027 --> 00:23:12,067
All right, to finish, let's take a scenario.

448
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:16,829
Say you wanna make yet another pirate-themed game, okay?

449
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:20,130
And you've done your research as we've discussed.

450
00:23:21,014 --> 00:23:23,376
You have primary documents, manuscripts,

451
00:23:23,717 --> 00:23:24,998
published primary documents.

452
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:26,920
You have some visual references.

453
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,641
You have some secondary sources.

454
00:23:29,142 --> 00:23:31,264
You may have even found an expert or two to advise.

455
00:23:31,764 --> 00:23:33,746
I could potentially advise a little bit about pirates.

456
00:23:34,827 --> 00:23:36,469
And once you've gone over the material,

457
00:23:37,089 --> 00:23:38,591
this is how your research findings

458
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:41,794
might compare to the pop culture reality of how

459
00:23:41,834 --> 00:23:42,895
people think about pirates.

460
00:23:45,527 --> 00:23:46,848
Here's a little research diagram.

461
00:23:47,328 --> 00:23:49,269
So we have all these tropes about pirates.

462
00:23:50,109 --> 00:23:51,890
Some of these end up being pretty accurate.

463
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:55,712
Pirates were often after Spanish loot, especially silver.

464
00:23:56,272 --> 00:23:58,573
They really did use black flags in some cases

465
00:23:58,653 --> 00:24:00,334
to signal that they were coming.

466
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:03,596
We have from pirate documents that they were often,

467
00:24:04,136 --> 00:24:06,077
people in an argument were forced on duels,

468
00:24:06,157 --> 00:24:08,638
especially on marooned islands.

469
00:24:09,178 --> 00:24:10,479
They definitely drank a lot of rum.

470
00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:15,201
We have evidence of eye patches and even a kind of a quirky

471
00:24:15,281 --> 00:24:19,022
theory that healthy people may have used an eye patch to keep

472
00:24:19,122 --> 00:24:22,703
one of their eyes ready for night vision in the below cabin.

473
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:25,964
Blackbeard was a real person with a lot of really crazy

474
00:24:26,645 --> 00:24:27,585
stories attributed to him.

475
00:24:28,545 --> 00:24:30,826
And we have evidence of some pretty crazy pirate towns like

476
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,367
Port Royal, where people wrote about there being so many

477
00:24:33,407 --> 00:24:35,948
taverns that the parrots and the monkeys were often drunk.

478
00:24:38,249 --> 00:24:40,972
We have lots of pirate tropes that are myths.

479
00:24:41,073 --> 00:24:46,620
The yarrr pirate voice was invented by the actor who played Long John Silver for Disney's

480
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,321
Treasure Island.

481
00:24:47,421 --> 00:24:51,486
And of course pirates were very diverse, so they would have had lots of other weird noises

482
00:24:51,566 --> 00:24:52,848
if they were French or Dutch.

483
00:24:53,329 --> 00:24:57,994
right? Um, we don't have any evidence of anybody walking the plank. Uh, certainly there were

484
00:24:58,014 --> 00:25:01,578
people who lost their legs as pirates, but they're probably not going to be climbing too many

485
00:25:01,638 --> 00:25:06,824
ropes after that. Um, and we have one instance of Captain Kidd in buried treasure, but this

486
00:25:06,864 --> 00:25:11,129
probably wasn't a great place to hide your loot, right? In addition to that, this, we'd find

487
00:25:11,169 --> 00:25:12,411
things that we never expected.

488
00:25:14,051 --> 00:25:16,352
The life of pirates is often really unglamorous.

489
00:25:16,672 --> 00:25:20,353
Sometimes when they take cities hostage, they would ask for things like food

490
00:25:20,453 --> 00:25:23,874
because they were hungry, because they're on the run, they don't get to relax a lot.

491
00:25:24,694 --> 00:25:28,855
A lot of pirate raids were less violent than you might expect akin to

492
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:32,116
a mugging where somebody quickly hands over their wallet because they don't want any trouble.

493
00:25:32,897 --> 00:25:37,178
We have evidence of a lot of women contributing to pirate culture, including in some cases women

494
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:41,199
who disguise their gender to pass as men and serve on pirate ships.

495
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:44,541
There's a tremendous amount of ethnic and racial diversity

496
00:25:44,601 --> 00:25:47,663
represented among pirate crews, a lot more religious influence

497
00:25:47,683 --> 00:25:49,704
than we see exhibited in a lot of games.

498
00:25:50,244 --> 00:25:53,246
And perhaps most surprising, a lot of pirate crews

499
00:25:53,366 --> 00:25:57,909
operated as democracies, agreeing on a set of agreed

500
00:25:58,009 --> 00:25:59,971
terms before they would carry out a voyage,

501
00:26:00,411 --> 00:26:03,373
oftentimes having pretty equal shares of the potential loot.

502
00:26:03,933 --> 00:26:05,254
And many of these agreements even

503
00:26:05,354 --> 00:26:07,335
incorporated health insurance, something

504
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:08,896
that a number of us would like to see

505
00:26:08,936 --> 00:26:10,037
included in our daily lives.

506
00:26:10,357 --> 00:26:10,577
All right?

507
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,343
Now, there's lots of different directions that you could go with this material.

508
00:26:16,603 --> 00:26:20,666
You could make a more silly game like Sea of Thieves or a more straightforward game

509
00:26:20,786 --> 00:26:25,790
like Black Flag, but no matter your strategy, you're going to have a lot of potential resources

510
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:32,094
to draw upon and you're going to have a much better possible amount of narratives to draw

511
00:26:32,134 --> 00:26:32,175
on.

512
00:26:32,595 --> 00:26:34,676
because of your historical research.

513
00:26:35,456 --> 00:26:37,817
So, I hope that regardless of your goals,

514
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:40,878
that you and your fearless crew won't be afraid

515
00:26:40,998 --> 00:26:42,798
of another trip to the library.

516
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:44,739
So, thank you for listening.

517
00:26:54,143 --> 00:26:55,463
And do we have time for questions?

518
00:26:58,024 --> 00:26:59,024
Yeah, take a couple.

519
00:27:00,565 --> 00:27:01,585
Ready, a little hard to see.

520
00:27:04,344 --> 00:27:08,448
You talked a lot about accurately representing

521
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:11,270
certain visual or physical elements of an error.

522
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:15,874
But I guess I wonder about viable counterfactual outcomes.

523
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:18,456
So I'm a huge fan of historical simulations.

524
00:27:18,556 --> 00:27:21,098
But of course, the player is the wild card

525
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,580
and will optimize and optimize.

526
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,042
And so often, these things that should

527
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:30,245
have been virtually impossible, as far as we know,

528
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:32,427
turn out to be very viable.

529
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:33,528
And so like, you know, like.

530
00:27:34,329 --> 00:27:39,711
I guess I'm curious about your thoughts about making more likely or more common outcomes

531
00:27:39,871 --> 00:27:41,992
actually more common in historical simulation.

532
00:27:42,032 --> 00:27:44,673
Yeah, I think there's a couple of theoretical approaches to that.

533
00:27:44,933 --> 00:27:45,934
One is with story.

534
00:27:46,154 --> 00:27:49,495
A lot of times you may want to feature things that are based closely on historic records,

535
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:52,937
but obviously as soon as we have play and reaction, we do have a counterfactual,

536
00:27:52,957 --> 00:27:54,097
so that's something that didn't happen.

537
00:27:54,557 --> 00:27:58,419
And so I think a good approach to that is by using what I'm doing in my own game,

538
00:27:58,439 --> 00:28:00,360
which is a composite historical fiction,

539
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,241
where it's a piece of original...

540
00:28:03,121 --> 00:28:05,242
plot, but you're drawing from all these influences.

541
00:28:05,702 --> 00:28:11,023
And then I think even though if we're allowing players to interact a lot, that that also

542
00:28:11,103 --> 00:28:15,804
generates counterfactuals, that we can sort of think about accuracy in terms of modeling

543
00:28:15,844 --> 00:28:16,444
a process.

544
00:28:17,204 --> 00:28:23,326
So in other words, if we build a virtual pirate ship, no one with the name of our online player

545
00:28:23,406 --> 00:28:28,147
ever actually sailed that, but we could try our best to sort of duplicate the mechanisms

546
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:32,428
of it and the other people that they encounter so that their input...

547
00:28:32,868 --> 00:28:35,630
is receiving a similar feedback as a historical character

548
00:28:35,651 --> 00:28:36,651
in that period might have.

549
00:28:37,372 --> 00:28:37,592
I see.

550
00:28:37,712 --> 00:28:38,033
Thank you.

551
00:28:38,053 --> 00:28:38,313
Thank you.

552
00:28:40,034 --> 00:28:40,915
Thank you for the talk.

553
00:28:41,255 --> 00:28:45,039
I played a lot of Civ IV, and Gandhi was a Christian,

554
00:28:45,199 --> 00:28:46,440
and he declared war on me.

555
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,543
So that wasn't very accurate.

556
00:28:50,564 --> 00:28:54,447
How comfortable are you in breaking history in Cassius?

557
00:28:54,547 --> 00:28:56,068
Or do we have to wait and see?

558
00:28:57,196 --> 00:29:02,438
I think my particular goals in Cassius are really to address a lot of misconceptions

559
00:29:02,498 --> 00:29:06,760
that both people get at historic sites when they go visit places like Monticello and also

560
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,461
that I get in my own classrooms.

561
00:29:08,641 --> 00:29:15,524
So it's got a pretty sober tone and it's designed to really put the focus on the scale of enslavement.

562
00:29:15,624 --> 00:29:19,405
You know, in a place like Monticello, if you go today, you'll see a restored house and

563
00:29:19,445 --> 00:29:21,666
maybe a cabin or two and they're trying to improve that.

564
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:22,506
But in a lot of cases...

565
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:24,607
You know, you would have one white family living

566
00:29:24,627 --> 00:29:25,307
in one of these houses.

567
00:29:25,327 --> 00:29:27,428
There could be up to 1,500 people that are

568
00:29:27,468 --> 00:29:28,608
working in the service of that.

569
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:30,948
And so, but that's my particular aim.

570
00:29:31,188 --> 00:29:34,349
You know, if your particular aim in a lighter area of history

571
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:36,009
is to be really, really silly, you know,

572
00:29:36,029 --> 00:29:37,850
I think some of those things can be productive.

573
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:39,770
And they can also get people thinking.

574
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:43,211
You know, when you play Siv and Gandhi is both a Christian

575
00:29:43,331 --> 00:29:48,672
and kills you, that dissonance is in itself educational,

576
00:29:48,752 --> 00:29:51,253
right, because you're noticing the difference from reality.

577
00:29:52,213 --> 00:29:52,313
Yeah.

578
00:29:53,527 --> 00:29:56,409
Hi, I'm a game designer and also a writer.

579
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:59,312
So I believe there's always a fantasy

580
00:29:59,392 --> 00:30:01,894
about rewrite the history, especially

581
00:30:02,074 --> 00:30:05,737
about becoming the hero who rewrite this history.

582
00:30:06,097 --> 00:30:09,640
But we rarely see that coming to part of the gameplay.

583
00:30:10,681 --> 00:30:14,364
I believe it's a really difficult design decision.

584
00:30:15,165 --> 00:30:19,108
since people already know what happened in real life,

585
00:30:19,188 --> 00:30:23,451
but if we have a rewrite the history at some point,

586
00:30:23,712 --> 00:30:27,134
that opens the Pandora's box to some extent.

587
00:30:27,455 --> 00:30:31,478
And especially that when we have that in the gameplay,

588
00:30:32,278 --> 00:30:38,383
we find that it's not as impactful as we expected.

589
00:30:38,823 --> 00:30:43,687
So how do you think about, what could you change about it?

590
00:30:44,488 --> 00:30:45,008
Yeah, that's it.

591
00:30:45,448 --> 00:30:46,709
I think it's just a really important thing

592
00:30:46,749 --> 00:30:47,910
to know what your goals are

593
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,752
and also to manage that tone effectively.

594
00:30:50,892 --> 00:30:52,954
So I think in all kinds of simulations,

595
00:30:53,334 --> 00:30:55,415
you could have a very respectful tour

596
00:30:55,435 --> 00:30:57,697
of a very serious battlefield

597
00:30:58,417 --> 00:31:00,259
where a lot of people died

598
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:01,740
and you want people to have a somber tone,

599
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,121
but if you're able to jump up

600
00:31:04,202 --> 00:31:05,943
and bounce on the gravestones like Mario

601
00:31:05,963 --> 00:31:06,703
or something like that,

602
00:31:06,863 --> 00:31:09,065
then that breaks that level of tone.

603
00:31:09,145 --> 00:31:09,285
So.

604
00:31:09,705 --> 00:31:14,928
I think you want to think ahead and account for the types of unexpected actions that people

605
00:31:14,969 --> 00:31:15,369
might have.

606
00:31:15,869 --> 00:31:19,471
But then again, like I said, in other cases, that sort of playfulness actually may have

607
00:31:19,531 --> 00:31:20,872
its own educational objectives.

608
00:31:21,172 --> 00:31:29,777
You just want to make sure that it's not sending kind of unfortunate or even misguided conclusions

609
00:31:29,837 --> 00:31:31,498
in the experience that players are having.

610
00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:32,299
Thank you.

611
00:31:32,779 --> 00:31:35,662
So I think it's 4.20 now, so we're going to go ahead and

612
00:31:35,682 --> 00:31:36,042
wrap up.

613
00:31:36,142 --> 00:31:38,945
I will hang out in the breakout room if anybody else

614
00:31:38,985 --> 00:31:39,586
wants to chat.

615
00:31:39,786 --> 00:31:41,107
And thank you so much again for coming.
