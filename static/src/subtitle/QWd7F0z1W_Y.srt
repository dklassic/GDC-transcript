1
00:00:06,453 --> 00:00:07,614
Thank you everyone for coming.

2
00:00:07,614 --> 00:00:10,036
This is Trailer Made, how to make successful

3
00:00:10,036 --> 00:00:14,060
and memorable trailers for games.

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,421
My name is Derek Liu,

5
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:18,123
and also please turn off your cell phones

6
00:00:18,123 --> 00:00:21,286
and don't forget to fill out your evaluations after this.

7
00:00:21,286 --> 00:00:26,311
And just, I'm curious, who here is a game developer?

8
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:29,393
And who here specifically wants to edit trailers for games?

9
00:00:30,494 --> 00:00:32,676
Oh, nice, cool.

10
00:00:32,676 --> 00:00:34,677
All right, so yeah, my name is Derek Liu,

11
00:00:34,677 --> 00:00:37,919
and I've been an editor for 15 years.

12
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:42,442
About a little bit over five has been specifically with games.

13
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:46,605
I've worked with some agencies in AAA games,

14
00:00:46,605 --> 00:00:48,927
but the last few years it's all been indies,

15
00:00:48,927 --> 00:00:51,809
and these are some of the games that I've worked on.

16
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:54,591
I work on both on very gamey games

17
00:00:54,591 --> 00:00:56,372
and also very story-driven games,

18
00:00:56,372 --> 00:00:58,053
which are lighter on game mechanics.

19
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:05,364
So today we're going to talk first about kind of the unique strength of trailers,

20
00:01:05,364 --> 00:01:10,107
some common pitfalls that I just see people doing all the time with their game trailers,

21
00:01:10,107 --> 00:01:13,809
talk a little bit about finding the hook for your game trailer,

22
00:01:13,809 --> 00:01:16,410
a little bit about teaching the audience about your game,

23
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,812
a little bit about basic trailer structure,

24
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:21,673
and then we'll have a whole bunch of tips and takeaways at the end.

25
00:01:23,086 --> 00:01:26,169
So first, let's talk about the goals of a game trailer.

26
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:31,053
The goals are to teach, to excite, and to tease.

27
00:01:31,053 --> 00:01:31,793
That's pretty much it.

28
00:01:31,793 --> 00:01:37,939
One or two out of three isn't bad,

29
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:41,001
but if you can do all three of these things

30
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:44,584
with your game trailers, then that's fantastic.

31
00:01:44,584 --> 00:01:46,045
First, just a bit of advice.

32
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:54,114
just generally don't use a trailer to communicate ideas which are easily described with words

33
00:01:54,114 --> 00:02:01,959
because a trailer lets you show the game's mood, the mechanics, the experience, and if well done

34
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:05,641
you can really like evoke feelings from the audience. For example...

35
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:11,550
This is from Untitled Goose Game, and just a few seconds of this tells you a whole lot.

36
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,475
It really just speaks for itself.

37
00:02:14,475 --> 00:02:17,601
But for example, what if instead it was like this?

38
00:02:19,263 --> 00:02:21,766
You know, in many cases just words aren't necessary,

39
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,428
but people just put them in anyway.

40
00:02:23,428 --> 00:02:25,870
I think sometimes they feel a little worried

41
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,272
that people won't get it.

42
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,834
But a lot of games really are good

43
00:02:28,834 --> 00:02:30,295
when they speak for themselves.

44
00:02:30,295 --> 00:02:33,399
And also, when you have a lot of text on a trailer,

45
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:35,841
I think it can feel very salesy.

46
00:02:35,841 --> 00:02:37,683
I think it can really turn people off

47
00:02:37,683 --> 00:02:39,766
if you kind of push a little bit too hard.

48
00:02:41,807 --> 00:02:45,348
And the exciting thing, I think, about trailers is,

49
00:02:45,348 --> 00:02:48,210
trailers use the language of film.

50
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,930
And you should really take advantage

51
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,412
of all the unique strengths of film language.

52
00:02:53,412 --> 00:02:58,834
For example, basic tools of film,

53
00:02:58,834 --> 00:03:03,075
visuals, sound, which also includes music and voiceover,

54
00:03:03,075 --> 00:03:04,396
and editing.

55
00:03:05,474 --> 00:03:10,656
And another way to think about a game trailer is this is the most control you're ever going

56
00:03:10,656 --> 00:03:12,537
to have over how people see your game.

57
00:03:12,537 --> 00:03:15,858
And in fact, it might be the only way a lot of people see your game.

58
00:03:15,858 --> 00:03:20,340
So why just throw a whole bunch of capture over music and then call it a day?

59
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,421
It's a really unique opportunity.

60
00:03:23,217 --> 00:03:28,600
Another thing that I need to say is a trailer is not a montage of random clips.

61
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,382
The order that you put things in, it really, really matters.

62
00:03:32,382 --> 00:03:36,445
You know, if you have two shots, each of them will have their own individual meaning, but

63
00:03:36,445 --> 00:03:39,466
you cut them together, then you create a third meaning.

64
00:03:40,392 --> 00:03:42,513
And that's really powerful.

65
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:46,495
For example, editing can really highlight cause and effect,

66
00:03:46,495 --> 00:03:49,136
which is something that you really want to teach people

67
00:03:49,136 --> 00:03:49,676
in a trailer.

68
00:03:49,676 --> 00:03:52,958
So for example, this is from Quadrilateral Cowboy,

69
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:56,560
which a lot of the game you spend typing on this computer.

70
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,662
and doing things like typing in these commands.

71
00:03:59,662 --> 00:04:03,686
So after you type this string for deactivating lasers,

72
00:04:03,686 --> 00:04:05,447
somewhere in the level, lasers turn off.

73
00:04:05,447 --> 00:04:08,270
But in the actual shot of the moment,

74
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,171
you might not see them because maybe they're above you

75
00:04:10,171 --> 00:04:10,892
or something like that.

76
00:04:10,892 --> 00:04:13,174
But in the trailer, you can easily just

77
00:04:13,174 --> 00:04:16,117
put the shot of the keyboard and then do a close-up

78
00:04:16,117 --> 00:04:17,177
of lasers turning off.

79
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:23,181
You know, you don't have to be totally adhering to exactly what the game looks like.

80
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:29,427
You can just do things like this to draw attention to how the game works.

81
00:04:29,427 --> 00:04:34,232
And in games, like, it's really hard to direct the player's eye unless you just kind of take

82
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:38,376
control from them, but in a trailer you have all that freedom and people will accept that.

83
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,647
And also editing, it can be simple.

84
00:04:42,647 --> 00:04:45,068
You don't have to be 2001 or Lawrence of Arabia

85
00:04:45,068 --> 00:04:47,410
with every single thing that you cut.

86
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:51,132
You can just be simply saying, if this, and then this.

87
00:04:51,132 --> 00:04:54,353
And often that's enough to just spark people's imagination

88
00:04:54,353 --> 00:04:55,814
when they can see the potential.

89
00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:02,931
Another thing I want to say is don't think of a trailer as a video of bullet points or

90
00:05:02,931 --> 00:05:08,073
like a delivery system for bullet points, which yes, you can get the job done if you

91
00:05:08,073 --> 00:05:12,775
just say like weapons and then show shots of weapons and then boss battles and then

92
00:05:12,775 --> 00:05:16,537
show boss battles and guns and show all the different guns.

93
00:05:16,537 --> 00:05:21,779
But I think that format can get very predictable and the audience, I think when they kind of

94
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:25,040
get keyed in to where you're going, then it gets a little less interesting.

95
00:05:26,347 --> 00:05:31,691
Another way to put this is don't waste time telling people

96
00:05:31,691 --> 00:05:34,834
the way your game is similar to other games.

97
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,435
A lot of times when you use bullet points,

98
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:37,676
it tends to turn out that way.

99
00:05:37,676 --> 00:05:41,279
Because when people watch a trailer for a new game,

100
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,200
they're going in wanting something new.

101
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,122
They're not thinking like, oh my God,

102
00:05:45,122 --> 00:05:46,383
I'm gonna watch this trailer,

103
00:05:46,383 --> 00:05:48,625
and I hope it's exactly like every other game

104
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,206
I've played before this.

105
00:05:50,206 --> 00:05:51,507
You know, and they're looking for like,

106
00:05:51,507 --> 00:05:52,968
what's the different thing about this one?

107
00:05:53,309 --> 00:05:55,410
So you should try to give that to them.

108
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:59,032
I mean, imagine if a restaurant opened in your town

109
00:05:59,032 --> 00:06:03,896
and they were like, we have chicken and vegetables,

110
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:06,517
and we use salt and pepper, and we have utensils.

111
00:06:06,517 --> 00:06:08,178
It'd be like, hmm, that's a little weird.

112
00:06:08,178 --> 00:06:11,861
You know, it'd only work if they're the only people

113
00:06:11,861 --> 00:06:12,641
in town who serve chicken.

114
00:06:12,641 --> 00:06:15,383
But other than that, it'd be a little suspicious.

115
00:06:15,383 --> 00:06:18,946
Another way to think about it is just like,

116
00:06:19,586 --> 00:06:23,128
familiar terms that you're used to can just really bog down a unique game.

117
00:06:23,128 --> 00:06:25,830
There are a lot of unique games which have a lot in common,

118
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,271
but if you focus on those things,

119
00:06:28,271 --> 00:06:31,313
then it doesn't differentiate your game.

120
00:06:31,313 --> 00:06:34,995
And again, it can be a little bit weird that if you're focusing on these things

121
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:37,556
that just are very familiar to the audience,

122
00:06:37,556 --> 00:06:39,438
they'd be like, is there nothing else?

123
00:06:39,438 --> 00:06:41,979
You know, it could be like, if you've ever read a resume

124
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:46,282
which people put like, knowledge of Windows and Google Chrome on it.

125
00:06:46,681 --> 00:06:49,783
okay it's a little bit weird that this is what you're focusing on, there must be nothing

126
00:06:49,783 --> 00:06:50,444
special here.

127
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:56,828
Or another way to think about it is, it could be like the most generic dating profile you

128
00:06:56,828 --> 00:06:58,129
could possibly imagine.

129
00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:03,252
Like if you've ever been unfortunate enough to be on dating apps, like everyone says these

130
00:07:03,252 --> 00:07:03,933
things.

131
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:08,796
The last one is specifically for men, because I've talked to some friends of mine, like

132
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:10,837
everyone mentions Quentin Tarantino as their favorite director.

133
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:17,163
So, you might think like you're saying a lot,

134
00:07:17,163 --> 00:07:21,366
but actually, if you do your research,

135
00:07:21,366 --> 00:07:22,387
you find out it's not very original.

136
00:07:22,387 --> 00:07:26,310
But the best time to use kind of familiar game terms

137
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:30,594
is maybe if your game has a unique combination of things.

138
00:07:30,594 --> 00:07:34,037
So, for example, like Splunky combined platformer

139
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:37,740
with roguelikes, and Dicey Dungeons combined

140
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,782
like dice rolling and dungeon crawler.

141
00:07:40,425 --> 00:07:45,195
and Puzzle Quest had like match three combined with a story RPG so that was interesting and novel.

142
00:07:46,355 --> 00:07:49,017
But if your game isn't kind of this combination

143
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:52,340
of familiar genres, you really need to focus

144
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,140
on what is unique.

145
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,523
Just, you know, one or two things.

146
00:07:56,523 --> 00:08:01,587
What is something that can only be said about your game?

147
00:08:01,587 --> 00:08:03,588
And it's really, I think it's better for people

148
00:08:03,588 --> 00:08:06,631
to remember one or two things about your game

149
00:08:06,631 --> 00:08:09,112
versus if you just kind of throw everything at them,

150
00:08:09,112 --> 00:08:11,254
like a dozen different ideas,

151
00:08:11,254 --> 00:08:13,856
and then they kind of don't retain any of that information.

152
00:08:14,902 --> 00:08:20,628
The other thing I think I see a lot is a lot of games seem kind of afraid to put their

153
00:08:20,628 --> 00:08:25,213
best foot forward when they have something unique and novel.

154
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:30,258
I think that what it feels like showing something new, they can be like, OK, here's my new idea.

155
00:08:30,258 --> 00:08:31,480
And they're like, ha ha.

156
00:08:32,401 --> 00:08:33,461
They're really afraid.

157
00:08:33,461 --> 00:08:34,682
They think it's risky.

158
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:37,343
But I really think the opposite is true.

159
00:08:37,343 --> 00:08:41,565
I think it's riskier to say, oh, it's a roguelike RPG,

160
00:08:41,565 --> 00:08:43,926
and there's action and stuff.

161
00:08:43,926 --> 00:08:49,409
So I think you shouldn't be coy about what is unique.

162
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:51,830
What you should do is just embrace

163
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,011
what is unique about your game and just make

164
00:08:54,011 --> 00:08:55,292
it look as good as possible.

165
00:08:57,082 --> 00:08:59,063
And if you're unsure about whether or not

166
00:08:59,063 --> 00:09:01,523
your trailer's working, you should think about

167
00:09:01,523 --> 00:09:05,024
what would someone tell a friend about your game

168
00:09:05,024 --> 00:09:07,005
after seeing your trailer?

169
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,625
You know, people generally, when they're sharing something,

170
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,866
like they watch a trailer, they don't go to their friend

171
00:09:11,866 --> 00:09:15,407
and say, oh, yeah, it has 50 hours of gameplay,

172
00:09:15,407 --> 00:09:18,827
it has 10 bosses, it has 12 levels,

173
00:09:18,827 --> 00:09:20,128
and it has, you know, 100 guns.

174
00:09:20,128 --> 00:09:23,208
They usually pick on something, kind of like

175
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,989
one little thing that they remember.

176
00:09:26,869 --> 00:09:29,150
So if you can figure out what that is gonna be

177
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,311
for your game, then that's great.

178
00:09:31,311 --> 00:09:33,572
So for example, like Ooblets,

179
00:09:33,572 --> 00:09:36,293
you grow cute animals on a farm.

180
00:09:36,293 --> 00:09:39,874
Or Firewatch, you're a lonely, middle-aged man in the woods.

181
00:09:39,874 --> 00:09:42,735
Also does a turtle.

182
00:09:42,735 --> 00:09:45,816
Heaven's Vault, you're a space archaeologist

183
00:09:45,816 --> 00:09:47,857
who deciphers an ancient language.

184
00:09:47,857 --> 00:09:49,838
Or Tokyo Jungle, like you're in Tokyo,

185
00:09:49,838 --> 00:09:52,118
but it's a jungle, and you're a Pomeranian.

186
00:09:52,118 --> 00:09:55,020
Tokyo Jungle's awesome.

187
00:09:56,674 --> 00:09:59,756
Super hot, the FPS where time only moves when you do.

188
00:09:59,756 --> 00:10:02,879
Just these little things that people,

189
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,761
just think about what you want people to say

190
00:10:05,761 --> 00:10:09,564
after watching the trailer and focus on making that work.

191
00:10:09,564 --> 00:10:12,126
So when you have your hook,

192
00:10:12,126 --> 00:10:15,368
you really need to consider the needs of the audience.

193
00:10:15,368 --> 00:10:17,290
Think about what the audience is looking for

194
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,891
when they're gonna watch your trailer.

195
00:10:18,891 --> 00:10:20,692
What do they need to know about your game

196
00:10:20,692 --> 00:10:22,714
in order to get excited about it?

197
00:10:23,471 --> 00:10:27,274
because there's a really unique burden on game trailers,

198
00:10:27,274 --> 00:10:30,636
which is that the audience needs to comprehend

199
00:10:30,636 --> 00:10:32,557
what they're seeing when they're watching it.

200
00:10:32,557 --> 00:10:36,480
What I mean is, when the audience hits play,

201
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,521
usually they're immediately trying to understand,

202
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:40,263
okay, how is this a game?

203
00:10:40,263 --> 00:10:41,804
What does the player do?

204
00:10:41,804 --> 00:10:45,086
They're looking for the gameplay, the unique things,

205
00:10:45,086 --> 00:10:46,507
or if it's not gameplay related,

206
00:10:46,507 --> 00:10:48,868
maybe they're looking for a story hook,

207
00:10:48,868 --> 00:10:51,971
or some really pretty art, or music that they really like.

208
00:10:52,931 --> 00:10:56,595
And just a lot of times people you can look at YouTube comments. They're like where's the gameplay?

209
00:10:56,595 --> 00:11:01,659
I don't understand it. Maybe it could just be right there, but it's not illustrated in a way that they understand

210
00:11:03,672 --> 00:11:08,033
Because game trailers, they really need to teach how the player fits into the game.

211
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:12,755
Because people just want to know what they're going to do when they're playing the game.

212
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:17,476
And they want to decide for themselves if it's going to be interesting or fun.

213
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:21,597
So, for example, like if we just showed this environment in Firewatch,

214
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:25,939
it's a little bit less clear than if you show the environment, like, holding the walkie-talkie.

215
00:11:25,939 --> 00:11:28,099
It's like, okay, I'm walking around and I have a walkie-talkie.

216
00:11:28,099 --> 00:11:29,720
It just gives you that much more information.

217
00:11:30,965 --> 00:11:34,509
And this idea, it's a little bit less important

218
00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:37,152
for announced trailers, I would say.

219
00:11:37,152 --> 00:11:39,394
I'd say kind of the closer you get to release,

220
00:11:39,394 --> 00:11:40,636
the more people will want to know,

221
00:11:40,636 --> 00:11:42,758
but if you kind of start out early,

222
00:11:42,758 --> 00:11:44,640
you just want to get kind of some buzz going,

223
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,563
then it's okay to be a little bit vague.

224
00:11:47,563 --> 00:11:49,245
It's less important for them to understand

225
00:11:49,245 --> 00:11:52,349
like the how of the game versus like the what.

226
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:58,993
But it's also just good to think of a game trailer like a tutorial.

227
00:11:58,993 --> 00:12:03,996
Just like when you're playing a game, the tutorial doesn't start with the most complicated ideas.

228
00:12:03,996 --> 00:12:08,519
You start simple and then you kind of escalate because, again, the trailer has to teach what's going on

229
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:15,744
so then people can get excited about the potential of when the mechanic gets turned on its head and all that.

230
00:12:15,744 --> 00:12:18,466
So, for example, like from Super Mario Odyssey here...

231
00:12:19,683 --> 00:12:23,813
uh... in one of the trailers fish first they show capi and then they show mario

232
00:12:23,813 --> 00:12:24,575
just kind of

233
00:12:24,575 --> 00:12:25,337
throwing

234
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:28,664
cappy and just doing all this basic platforming stuff and then they kind of

235
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:32,686
take this moment here with a really really big point of this one mechanic

236
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:37,690
they spend all this time we like it goes into the frog is alternate dimension and

237
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,212
then after this like oh man this is the thing you can do and then they start

238
00:12:41,212 --> 00:12:44,474
exploring all these different possibilities and then hopefully at this

239
00:12:44,474 --> 00:12:48,097
point you're like oh my god what could Mario throw his hat at you know it could

240
00:12:48,097 --> 00:12:49,858
be this could be this and then you know

241
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:57,059
So, it's important for certain ideas to just get introduced early, especially new and novel

242
00:12:57,059 --> 00:12:58,199
mechanics.

243
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:04,603
You really need to build that knowledge, because if they can't understand, then that means

244
00:13:04,603 --> 00:13:05,004
that they're...

245
00:13:05,724 --> 00:13:08,105
just trying to understand the entire time,

246
00:13:08,105 --> 00:13:09,706
which means they're just missing everything

247
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:10,586
you're trying to throw at them

248
00:13:10,586 --> 00:13:12,727
because they don't have the context to know what's going on.

249
00:13:12,727 --> 00:13:17,570
But so like, you know, the way they did it,

250
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:20,971
then it totally works because they understand,

251
00:13:20,971 --> 00:13:23,412
throw a copy at things and then you can possess things.

252
00:13:23,412 --> 00:13:24,273
So now they're thinking, oh my God.

253
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:31,100
I want to know what else I can do it with, and the possibility space is just expanding.

254
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,886
This sounds very, very basic, but I've seen a lot of trailers where they put this important

255
00:13:35,886 --> 00:13:39,350
information in the middle or late in the trailer.

256
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,071
So for example...

257
00:13:40,952 --> 00:13:47,137
If all the first shots in this trailer were of animals with mustaches, you might think

258
00:13:47,137 --> 00:13:51,420
to yourself, like, oh, is this, it looks like Mario, is this actually a Mario game?

259
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:56,304
And then later on, they show Mario jumping into a thing, then kind of all the shots that

260
00:13:56,304 --> 00:13:59,907
came before then would have been hard to remember at that point.

261
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:05,191
It sounds very basic, but there are a lot of trailers I see where this is a problem.

262
00:14:07,683 --> 00:14:11,705
So just think about one or two pieces of information

263
00:14:11,705 --> 00:14:12,905
needed to kind of recontextualize

264
00:14:12,905 --> 00:14:14,686
all the rest of the footage that you want to show,

265
00:14:14,686 --> 00:14:15,946
which is really exciting.

266
00:14:15,946 --> 00:14:21,169
Again, because the audience won't get excited or invested

267
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:24,410
if they're just working, spending all their mental energy

268
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,731
to think about what is going on,

269
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:28,832
and then it will be much more exciting and engaging

270
00:14:28,832 --> 00:14:30,213
when they understand the basics.

271
00:14:33,475 --> 00:14:39,219
Like just think about, imagine if there was a trailer for Portal where all the first shots

272
00:14:39,219 --> 00:14:46,245
were walking and running and on jump platforms and going through doors and then later on

273
00:14:46,245 --> 00:14:47,325
they showed the Portal.

274
00:14:47,325 --> 00:14:47,886
It's like...

275
00:14:48,226 --> 00:14:50,707
it doesn't really make sense because people don't need all the information

276
00:14:50,707 --> 00:14:55,028
beginning so they have the portal at the beginning and then after that they

277
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:57,729
start thinking about oh my god I could shoot there I could shoot there and I

278
00:14:57,729 --> 00:15:01,430
could do this sort of thing. Basically you want the audience to see the game's

279
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:04,371
potential and understand the possibilities and then they get when

280
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:07,411
they get really excited like oh my god and then when I get the game I could do

281
00:15:07,411 --> 00:15:11,793
this and I could do this I want to play it you know. So let's talk a little bit

282
00:15:11,793 --> 00:15:14,734
about basic trailer structure. This is all about pacing.

283
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:25,238
Pacing is hard, but so here we have this graph where the bottom is time and the other is

284
00:15:25,238 --> 00:15:25,939
intensity.

285
00:15:25,939 --> 00:15:30,483
Intensity could mean several things, but I just generally mean like how exciting is the

286
00:15:30,483 --> 00:15:31,664
trailer at that moment.

287
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:37,169
Thing is, you know, if the intensity is low the entire time, of course that's boring.

288
00:15:37,994 --> 00:15:41,601
But conversely, if it's high all the time,

289
00:15:41,601 --> 00:15:43,144
that also gets kind of boring,

290
00:15:43,144 --> 00:15:44,446
kind of like the Michael Bay effect,

291
00:15:44,446 --> 00:15:47,071
where when everything's exploding all the time,

292
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,356
then you kind of get inured to it.

293
00:15:50,981 --> 00:15:54,545
And you'd think that maybe this is the best,

294
00:15:54,545 --> 00:15:57,748
where it kind of increases and gets more and more exciting

295
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:58,989
as you go along.

296
00:15:58,989 --> 00:16:00,731
But even that is almost kind of boring

297
00:16:00,731 --> 00:16:02,433
because it becomes kind of predictable.

298
00:16:02,433 --> 00:16:05,816
It's like counting one, two, three, four, five.

299
00:16:05,816 --> 00:16:09,920
So the curve that I like is this one.

300
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,791
So basically, you have a cold open,

301
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,171
which starts very exciting,

302
00:16:17,171 --> 00:16:20,772
and then you kind of, just to kind of hook the audience,

303
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:23,492
and then after that, hopefully you have their attention.

304
00:16:23,492 --> 00:16:26,613
Then you start introducing some new ideas.

305
00:16:26,613 --> 00:16:29,293
And then you just kind of escalate,

306
00:16:29,293 --> 00:16:30,614
maybe turn them on their head,

307
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,794
and then hopefully by the end,

308
00:16:32,794 --> 00:16:34,634
you have put the most exciting footage,

309
00:16:34,634 --> 00:16:36,715
and then maybe you have your title card,

310
00:16:36,715 --> 00:16:38,615
and if you want, sometimes you put a button.

311
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,063
which is kind of like this one last little tease.

312
00:16:42,063 --> 00:16:46,346
So to give you some more specifics about each act,

313
00:16:46,346 --> 00:16:50,029
cold open is to hook the audience,

314
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:54,573
whether it's exciting editing or pretty visuals

315
00:16:54,573 --> 00:16:56,855
or action or humor, you just wanna.

316
00:16:57,806 --> 00:16:59,948
get them in, kind of like stand-up comedians.

317
00:16:59,948 --> 00:17:02,550
They always have to have the first joke be the best,

318
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,672
because if it isn't, then the audience

319
00:17:04,672 --> 00:17:06,033
doesn't want to laugh with them.

320
00:17:06,033 --> 00:17:08,415
It's also why a lot of times on YouTube

321
00:17:08,415 --> 00:17:10,617
you see movie trailers, they put a little teaser

322
00:17:10,617 --> 00:17:12,239
before the trailer, which is really annoying,

323
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:15,041
but it works apparently, unfortunately.

324
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,123
But the better thing to do is if you just

325
00:17:17,123 --> 00:17:19,125
make the beginning exciting and have

326
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,406
that be part of the trailer.

327
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,808
But if you want to do the mini teaser thing, too,

328
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:23,989
it's proven to work.

329
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,947
So then the introduction, you just kind of educate the audience kind of where the chess

330
00:17:29,947 --> 00:17:30,628
pieces are.

331
00:17:30,628 --> 00:17:35,555
And then escalation is like, ooh, there's something going on here.

332
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,497
You got to introduce some complexity into the story.

333
00:17:39,143 --> 00:17:41,045
And then you get the climax.

334
00:17:41,045 --> 00:17:42,566
It's really, really exciting.

335
00:17:42,566 --> 00:17:43,407
And then you have a title.

336
00:17:43,407 --> 00:17:45,389
And then there's a button for a little thing

337
00:17:45,389 --> 00:17:47,010
to delight the audience at the end.

338
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:50,593
And then also, don't forget your call to action, your end slate.

339
00:17:50,593 --> 00:17:52,415
There's all these different things.

340
00:17:52,415 --> 00:17:54,456
Maybe you don't want to do them all.

341
00:17:54,456 --> 00:17:55,858
Maybe pick the ones that are most important,

342
00:17:55,858 --> 00:17:57,999
because I feel like when you have a ton of stuff,

343
00:17:57,999 --> 00:18:01,022
then people are less likely to want to do any of it.

344
00:18:01,022 --> 00:18:02,803
But end slate's very important.

345
00:18:04,445 --> 00:18:07,348
Okay, so best and worst thing about game trailers

346
00:18:07,348 --> 00:18:09,670
is you get to create all your own shots.

347
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:12,492
And I did a talk before about Game Capture.

348
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:14,213
If you go to gametrailerdebugtools.com,

349
00:18:14,213 --> 00:18:18,437
I have a really in-depth thing about Game Capture.

350
00:18:18,437 --> 00:18:21,099
But just something to help you right now

351
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:22,640
is questions you can help,

352
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,561
you can use to help ask your,

353
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:27,264
you can ask yourself to evaluate your shots for your trailers.

354
00:18:27,264 --> 00:18:29,186
Basically, these all build up on top of each other.

355
00:18:29,186 --> 00:18:32,128
So first, ask yourself, is it clear?

356
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:33,990
It's no point in having a shot

357
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,131
if you can't tell what's going on.

358
00:18:35,131 --> 00:18:37,013
Is it interesting?

359
00:18:37,013 --> 00:18:40,277
It could be clear, but it could be really boring,

360
00:18:40,277 --> 00:18:41,758
so then that's no good.

361
00:18:41,758 --> 00:18:42,079
Is it new?

362
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:46,244
You always wanna have a lot of variety in your trailer,

363
00:18:46,244 --> 00:18:48,586
because once you start repeating yourself,

364
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:49,467
people will start thinking,

365
00:18:49,467 --> 00:18:51,029
oh, I guess there was nothing new to show.

366
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:53,758
And then last is, is it pretty?

367
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:56,640
If you can get all of them, fantastic.

368
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,720
If you don't get all of them,

369
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,522
then your game just better be like incredibly pretty

370
00:19:02,522 --> 00:19:04,183
or have amazing music.

371
00:19:04,183 --> 00:19:06,504
Which, if you have that, Yahtzee.

372
00:19:06,504 --> 00:19:09,885
How do you decide the order of shots?

373
00:19:09,885 --> 00:19:11,125
This is also really hard,

374
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,987
but here's a kind of basic way to think about things.

375
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:18,883
So this is something I do, is first inventory the game's objects,

376
00:19:18,883 --> 00:19:23,467
like player verbs, enemies, environments, obstacles, powerups, all those things.

377
00:19:23,467 --> 00:19:27,310
Just think about what's in the game that we could show.

378
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,752
And then I like to rate my clips.

379
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,974
So for example, this first shot, it's like a one star.

380
00:19:32,974 --> 00:19:35,136
It's kind of really basic part of Super Mario.

381
00:19:35,136 --> 00:19:37,858
Then this other one's two, because there's some enemies there.

382
00:19:37,858 --> 00:19:40,561
And then this one's three, because it's a boss battle.

383
00:19:41,461 --> 00:19:44,703
And then you can just look at the curve here,

384
00:19:44,703 --> 00:19:45,604
and then you can say, okay,

385
00:19:45,604 --> 00:19:47,646
we'll start with a three-star shot,

386
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:48,887
and then we'll go down to one,

387
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:53,010
and then we'll do two, and then three.

388
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,311
You can think about it that way,

389
00:19:54,311 --> 00:19:56,252
just as a starting point.

390
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,620
But even that can be kind of predictable,

391
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,542
and then you could end up with a lot of boring shots

392
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:02,503
in the beginning.

393
00:20:02,503 --> 00:20:06,147
So actually what I like to do is kind of do things in waves.

394
00:20:06,147 --> 00:20:10,230
So for Spelunky 2, I would have kind of mini montages

395
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,151
within the montage.

396
00:20:11,151 --> 00:20:14,515
So this is like a one-star shot where they're just running,

397
00:20:14,515 --> 00:20:16,276
then there's a shopkeeper moment,

398
00:20:16,276 --> 00:20:19,159
then there's this mini boss.

399
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:20,480
And then after that, we go back down

400
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,601
to something less interesting.

401
00:20:21,842 --> 00:20:23,683
which is like this crossbow thing,

402
00:20:23,683 --> 00:20:26,305
and then there's these traps,

403
00:20:26,305 --> 00:20:27,786
and this other shot with this kind of

404
00:20:27,786 --> 00:20:29,567
flying gray snake thingy.

405
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:33,130
And then you can imagine, like, on the graph in waves.

406
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:36,072
You know, one, two, three, one, two, three.

407
00:20:36,072 --> 00:20:36,712
It's like music.

408
00:20:36,712 --> 00:20:38,254
All right, let's get into some.

409
00:20:43,219 --> 00:20:46,322
Tips and takeaways.

410
00:20:46,322 --> 00:20:48,843
Again, focus on what's unique.

411
00:20:48,843 --> 00:20:51,425
Find the hook and really focus on the hook.

412
00:20:51,425 --> 00:20:54,448
If there's time, then I'd say it's fine

413
00:20:54,448 --> 00:20:56,950
to put in other things that people will find familiar,

414
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,171
but not at the expense of showing what's unique.

415
00:21:01,012 --> 00:21:03,232
and let the game speak for itself.

416
00:21:03,232 --> 00:21:04,753
You know, a narrator that says like,

417
00:21:04,753 --> 00:21:09,114
this is a cool game, doesn't make the game seem cool.

418
00:21:09,114 --> 00:21:12,015
And it just, it's like a car salesman basically

419
00:21:12,015 --> 00:21:15,517
in the trailer saying, check out this game, it's so cool.

420
00:21:15,517 --> 00:21:17,017
If you do want to have a narrator,

421
00:21:17,017 --> 00:21:19,078
something I like when people do is

422
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:21,118
when they put the narrator kind of in universe,

423
00:21:21,118 --> 00:21:23,379
where it's like their character in the game,

424
00:21:23,379 --> 00:21:25,260
so it feels a little bit more like

425
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,420
the game is talking for itself

426
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,441
instead of like they hired a trailer person

427
00:21:28,441 --> 00:21:30,222
to be like, I'm the hype man, you know.

428
00:21:31,908 --> 00:21:35,114
Again, is it clear?

429
00:21:35,114 --> 00:21:37,237
Is it interesting?

430
00:21:37,237 --> 00:21:38,921
Is it new?

431
00:21:38,921 --> 00:21:39,722
And is it pretty?

432
00:21:42,346 --> 00:21:44,426
Next, get good music.

433
00:21:44,426 --> 00:21:47,907
Music and art style are the most important part

434
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:49,528
of the trailer, but music especially.

435
00:21:49,528 --> 00:21:52,548
Like I've seen a lot of trailers where I can see

436
00:21:52,548 --> 00:21:57,110
that they really didn't mind just mixing the music way down

437
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,730
until it was completely inaudible,

438
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,330
which means the music wasn't good enough,

439
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:02,051
so why'd they use it?

440
00:22:02,051 --> 00:22:04,971
If you look at a lot of top 10 game trailer lists,

441
00:22:04,971 --> 00:22:07,472
a lot of them, like they're not really reinventing the wheel,

442
00:22:07,472 --> 00:22:09,733
but they all have amazing music.

443
00:22:09,733 --> 00:22:10,573
So people say,

444
00:22:10,653 --> 00:22:15,542
this is the best trailer ever like mad world in years of war

445
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:15,723
uh...

446
00:22:16,322 --> 00:22:18,964
Another thing is listen to trailer music for inspiration.

447
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:21,526
There's a lot of companies that work with,

448
00:22:21,526 --> 00:22:23,167
like movie trailer companies,

449
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:25,469
that make music specifically for trailers.

450
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,170
And, I mean, it's not royalty free.

451
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:30,573
It's always like individual license per use.

452
00:22:30,573 --> 00:22:32,534
But a lot of people upload it to YouTube.

453
00:22:32,534 --> 00:22:33,975
And if you just look up trailer music,

454
00:22:33,975 --> 00:22:36,577
you'll find a lot where they basically build in

455
00:22:36,577 --> 00:22:39,399
the pacing of a trailer into those tracks,

456
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,301
where they like build in like the stop down moment,

457
00:22:41,301 --> 00:22:44,263
and then they resume and it's like a second climax, so.

458
00:22:44,824 --> 00:22:48,987
It's a good kind of cheat sheet for thinking about trailer structure.

459
00:22:48,987 --> 00:22:51,089
Put things in sync.

460
00:22:51,089 --> 00:22:55,413
People like when stuff is cut on the beat.

461
00:22:55,413 --> 00:22:57,494
It's just fun to watch.

462
00:22:57,494 --> 00:22:59,116
How you do it is up to you.

463
00:22:59,116 --> 00:23:01,318
Some people like to put the cuts on the beat.

464
00:23:01,318 --> 00:23:03,920
I like to put the actions on the beat.

465
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,902
It kind of goes back and forth, but it's all personal preference.

466
00:23:06,902 --> 00:23:08,564
But it's fun.

467
00:23:10,251 --> 00:23:13,533
Next is read your trailer dialogue from beginning to end.

468
00:23:13,533 --> 00:23:16,475
So if you have a very narrative-focused game

469
00:23:16,475 --> 00:23:19,456
and you have a lot of dialogue, or even if it's text-based,

470
00:23:19,456 --> 00:23:24,679
just put all your dialogue on a notepad or something like that

471
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:27,641
and just read it through and see if from beginning to end

472
00:23:27,641 --> 00:23:29,782
you can kind of chart the through line of the story.

473
00:23:29,782 --> 00:23:32,104
Because a lot of times in trailers,

474
00:23:32,104 --> 00:23:36,006
you can tell they just took random scenes

475
00:23:36,006 --> 00:23:38,127
and they don't tell the story within the trailer.

476
00:23:39,128 --> 00:23:45,654
And it ends up just kind of going in one ear and out the other because nothing connects.

477
00:23:45,654 --> 00:23:47,956
So it's good to read it all through.

478
00:23:47,956 --> 00:23:51,840
Shots should end once their main idea is expressed.

479
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,802
So just don't overstay your welcome.

480
00:23:53,802 --> 00:23:57,005
As soon as you get to the point, just cut.

481
00:23:57,005 --> 00:24:00,568
And everything will be nice and tight.

482
00:24:00,568 --> 00:24:01,089
Logos.

483
00:24:04,889 --> 00:24:08,791
If people won't recognize your logo, don't show it in the opening.

484
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:09,831
Just swallow your pride.

485
00:24:09,831 --> 00:24:15,634
There are very, very few companies, especially indies, who when they see the logo, they're

486
00:24:15,634 --> 00:24:16,134
like, yes!

487
00:24:16,134 --> 00:24:16,374
Oh my god!

488
00:24:17,032 --> 00:24:18,172
And even some that are well-known,

489
00:24:18,172 --> 00:24:19,713
people don't know their names.

490
00:24:19,713 --> 00:24:21,334
So you're just wasting time.

491
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,935
In some cases, people might think

492
00:24:22,935 --> 00:24:25,196
that's the name of your game.

493
00:24:25,196 --> 00:24:29,518
And you're just giving more time for people to stop watching,

494
00:24:29,518 --> 00:24:31,239
because people get very impatient when they're watching

495
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:34,040
stuff on YouTube, and especially if you're fading in and out

496
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,281
to black.

497
00:24:35,281 --> 00:24:37,562
So just put it on your end slate.

498
00:24:37,562 --> 00:24:38,423
It's fine.

499
00:24:38,423 --> 00:24:40,284
If you have a very good track record,

500
00:24:40,284 --> 00:24:44,546
then someday you can put your logo at the beginning,

501
00:24:44,546 --> 00:24:45,567
and people will cheer for it.

502
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:49,271
Turn off the HUD.

503
00:24:49,271 --> 00:24:52,794
Most games don't need the HUD turned on in the trailer.

504
00:24:52,794 --> 00:24:57,478
I basically say to people it's kind of like when you're driving and a leaf shows up on

505
00:24:57,478 --> 00:24:58,058
your windshield.

506
00:24:58,058 --> 00:25:02,102
Or if you ever tried to watch a movie with subtitles on and not read the subtitles, this

507
00:25:02,102 --> 00:25:04,865
is basically what HUD is like in a game trailer.

508
00:25:04,865 --> 00:25:09,549
HUD is information that's needed for the player to play the game, not for people watching

509
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:09,929
a trailer.

510
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:14,711
but like just some exceptions ish

511
00:25:14,711 --> 00:25:16,892
is like a real-time strategy games,

512
00:25:16,892 --> 00:25:18,813
which a lot of the game is HUD,

513
00:25:18,813 --> 00:25:21,354
but in those situations I usually tell people,

514
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:24,615
if you can, maybe only show the parts of the HUD

515
00:25:24,615 --> 00:25:26,295
relevant to that particular shot,

516
00:25:26,295 --> 00:25:27,956
and then get rid of everything else,

517
00:25:27,956 --> 00:25:30,156
which it is extra work, but it makes things much clearer.

518
00:25:30,156 --> 00:25:34,098
And then just really consider the HUD

519
00:25:34,098 --> 00:25:36,638
as just anything else that's in the trailer.

520
00:25:36,638 --> 00:25:38,639
Is this necessary for this shot

521
00:25:38,639 --> 00:25:40,340
to communicate the idea that I want?

522
00:25:41,945 --> 00:25:45,407
Bless you.

523
00:25:45,407 --> 00:25:46,948
Don't get hung up on editing style.

524
00:25:46,948 --> 00:25:50,189
Worry about the trailer's goals.

525
00:25:50,189 --> 00:25:52,471
I see a lot of YouTube tutorials where people are like,

526
00:25:52,471 --> 00:25:53,571
oh, try cutting to black,

527
00:25:53,571 --> 00:25:55,913
and then try flashing to black and white

528
00:25:55,913 --> 00:25:56,733
and that sort of thing,

529
00:25:56,733 --> 00:25:59,255
or everything should be cut really fast at the end,

530
00:25:59,255 --> 00:26:01,616
but it's all kind of arbitrary

531
00:26:01,616 --> 00:26:05,278
unless it's for a particular feeling or something like that.

532
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,700
So think more about what your trailer is trying to achieve

533
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,622
and find the best way to do that.

534
00:26:13,893 --> 00:26:17,156
Show your trailer to someone who doesn't know anything about your game.

535
00:26:17,156 --> 00:26:19,659
Other people will notice things that you don't see.

536
00:26:19,659 --> 00:26:23,763
And even sometimes if you just have a person with you while you're watching the trailer,

537
00:26:23,763 --> 00:26:27,166
you'll immediately kind of see it through their eyes and be like, oh crap, there's this

538
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:28,828
thing there that I didn't realize was there.

539
00:26:28,828 --> 00:26:29,869
I gotta fix that.

540
00:26:29,869 --> 00:26:32,651
And the other thing is that...

541
00:26:33,112 --> 00:26:36,675
especially if you're a game developer making your own trailer,

542
00:26:36,675 --> 00:26:39,278
it can be really easy to kind of forget

543
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:40,860
what was special about your game,

544
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:44,724
and at the same time, you can have things that you think are really special

545
00:26:44,724 --> 00:26:47,787
that other people are like, I don't really care,

546
00:26:47,787 --> 00:26:49,909
but to you, it took months to implement this one thing

547
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:52,372
or something like that, so you want to put it in.

548
00:26:52,372 --> 00:26:53,513
So it's good to have another person.

549
00:26:54,385 --> 00:26:55,505
Again, don't show everything.

550
00:26:55,505 --> 00:26:57,106
Gotta tease the audience.

551
00:26:57,106 --> 00:26:58,887
It's just enough to get them interested,

552
00:26:58,887 --> 00:27:01,388
but not enough for them to really understand fully,

553
00:27:01,388 --> 00:27:03,989
especially with announced trailers.

554
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,150
Because, I mean, a game that can be really summed up

555
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,630
completely in a trailer,

556
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:09,831
it won't seem like it has a lot to it.

557
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:16,526
uh... more information can be less interesting like my i have my cats here

558
00:27:16,526 --> 00:27:19,891
all the time sometimes i was waving the toy in front of them and they're like

559
00:27:19,891 --> 00:27:23,536
yeah whatever and then i put it underneath a blanket like i need to get

560
00:27:23,536 --> 00:27:24,578
the toy

561
00:27:24,578 --> 00:27:26,500
people like that would trailers to

562
00:27:27,121 --> 00:27:28,662
and I think if you say too much,

563
00:27:28,662 --> 00:27:31,064
you can kind of go past the sail and turn people off.

564
00:27:31,064 --> 00:27:32,846
Like I have this friend,

565
00:27:32,846 --> 00:27:34,907
he gets really excited about movies,

566
00:27:34,907 --> 00:27:36,108
and he'll be like, oh Derek,

567
00:27:36,108 --> 00:27:38,710
there's this movie called Inception,

568
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:39,851
and they go into people's dreams,

569
00:27:39,851 --> 00:27:41,272
I'm like, oh, that sounds cool,

570
00:27:41,272 --> 00:27:42,173
and then he just keeps going.

571
00:27:42,173 --> 00:27:43,294
He's like, and then they have this heist,

572
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:45,075
and then the heist goes wrong,

573
00:27:45,075 --> 00:27:46,116
and then they have to go even deeper,

574
00:27:46,116 --> 00:27:46,957
and then there's snow,

575
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:48,398
I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

576
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:50,239
Okay, I'm already interested, just stop.

577
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:53,722
Don't rob people that sense of discovery.

578
00:27:55,438 --> 00:28:00,521
And again, start the trailer with the most important, unique, or exciting idea.

579
00:28:00,521 --> 00:28:03,963
And you might blow people's minds the more they watch the trailer.

580
00:28:03,963 --> 00:28:10,507
Because you think about it, a lot of games are about exploring this one idea and turning

581
00:28:10,507 --> 00:28:12,408
it on its head and exploring it.

582
00:28:12,408 --> 00:28:14,749
You basically want to kind of give that feeling for the trailer.

583
00:28:16,769 --> 00:28:19,435
And also just think about trailers as early as possible.

584
00:28:19,435 --> 00:28:23,043
It could even be before you design a game

585
00:28:23,043 --> 00:28:24,566
or while you're doing it,

586
00:28:24,566 --> 00:28:26,089
because it's really, really important

587
00:28:26,089 --> 00:28:26,811
to have a good trailer.

588
00:28:27,797 --> 00:28:31,338
And if you find out your game is really hard to make a trailer for,

589
00:28:31,338 --> 00:28:36,139
then maybe that could be an opportunity to think about its visuals or its design

590
00:28:36,139 --> 00:28:38,679
in a way that would make it better for that.

591
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:41,300
And it's really important too because, you know, it's going to...

592
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,460
you're going to need to make animated GIFs,

593
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:46,321
and then people are going to make YouTube videos and stream on Twitch.

594
00:28:46,321 --> 00:28:49,842
So you want the visual communication to be really good.

595
00:28:49,842 --> 00:28:52,062
And that's it. Thank you for coming.

596
00:28:52,062 --> 00:28:53,142
This is my website.

597
00:28:56,388 --> 00:28:59,369
I also have a website, GameTrailerSpecs,

598
00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:02,371
where all those little nitty gritty console things,

599
00:29:02,371 --> 00:29:05,252
like the bit rate, I just put them on one site

600
00:29:05,252 --> 00:29:07,213
and ESRB sort of regulation stuff.

601
00:29:07,213 --> 00:29:10,355
And then again, I have a whole bunch of debug tools

602
00:29:10,355 --> 00:29:12,736
that I listed that are good to implement your games

603
00:29:12,736 --> 00:29:15,198
specifically for trailers.

604
00:29:15,198 --> 00:29:17,539
And do we have time for questions?

605
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:18,099
Okay, I think we do not.

606
00:29:18,099 --> 00:29:22,141
But I'll stick around if you have questions.

607
00:29:22,141 --> 00:29:23,982
Everyone, thank you for coming.
