1
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:05,960
Cool.

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,401
Hi, my name is Nicolae Berbece.

3
00:00:10,021 --> 00:00:11,742
I'm a self-proclaimed game designer,

4
00:00:12,322 --> 00:00:14,323
but I actually use a Microsoft Surface instead of a Mac.

5
00:00:15,003 --> 00:00:16,584
And I founded a company called Those Awesome Guys,

6
00:00:16,604 --> 00:00:18,884
which is like a super small team from all over the world.

7
00:00:19,745 --> 00:00:21,205
And we made a game called Move or Die.

8
00:00:21,585 --> 00:00:25,207
And I'm here today to talk about the success of Move or Die.

9
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:26,787
And in order to do that,

10
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:28,068
I'm gonna have to go back a few years.

11
00:00:28,868 --> 00:00:30,889
Really quickly, Move or Die is a four-player,

12
00:00:31,069 --> 00:00:33,610
competitive, friendship-winning party game

13
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:34,830
that looks.

14
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:35,867
Something like this.

15
00:00:36,707 --> 00:00:37,648
It's very fast-paced.

16
00:00:38,428 --> 00:00:39,669
And people react to it like this.

17
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,132
So 2010, I used to make a lot of flash games,

18
00:00:45,352 --> 00:00:46,452
a lot of weird flash games.

19
00:00:46,472 --> 00:00:48,534
Like I made a game where you play with two players

20
00:00:48,654 --> 00:00:49,414
at the same time.

21
00:00:49,994 --> 00:00:51,835
I made a flash game where you have to literally punch

22
00:00:51,855 --> 00:00:54,457
your keyboard, a competitive drinking game where

23
00:00:54,477 --> 00:00:56,978
you play as a vulture, and a fighting game where

24
00:00:56,998 --> 00:00:58,139
you slap microphones.

25
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,841
And one particular flash game was called Concerned Joe.

26
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:04,822
And it was a single-player, narration-based.

27
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:09,391
puzzle platformer, which is quite unusual for a Flash game, and players liked it a lot.

28
00:01:10,312 --> 00:01:14,134
And because they liked it a lot, I wasn't really happy with it because it wasn't performing

29
00:01:14,234 --> 00:01:15,554
as well as I wanted it to be.

30
00:01:16,615 --> 00:01:20,377
And I basically wanted to do a reimagining of that game.

31
00:01:21,077 --> 00:01:28,321
So a game from scratch with new art, new graphics, new soundtrack, everything from scratch.

32
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,202
A real game, not a Flash game.

33
00:01:31,142 --> 00:01:34,043
In order to do that, we started looking into what...

34
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:41,081
languages we could use our frameworks and back then unity didn't have a dedicated 2d option if I'm not mistaking and

35
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,681
Unreal was way too complicated for what we needed

36
00:01:44,202 --> 00:01:50,103
So we tried c++ for a while and after about three weeks of development we had this and we basically said no

37
00:01:50,123 --> 00:01:54,823
Thank you, and we stumbled upon love 2d and love 2d is the super cool open source

38
00:01:55,424 --> 00:01:58,144
framework running in Lua and

39
00:01:59,004 --> 00:02:01,105
Not only the scripting parts are running in Lua

40
00:02:01,564 --> 00:02:03,005
the whole damn thing is running in Lua.

41
00:02:03,045 --> 00:02:05,347
So Concerned Joe was running in Lua as a whole.

42
00:02:06,068 --> 00:02:08,770
So we started development, and we made a lot of bad decisions

43
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,351
in the process.

44
00:02:10,772 --> 00:02:12,273
Because we weren't on Steam, we decided,

45
00:02:12,293 --> 00:02:14,274
oh, we're going to make our own distribution system, where

46
00:02:14,294 --> 00:02:15,916
you would log in with your credentials,

47
00:02:16,756 --> 00:02:19,038
and the passwords were properly salted, by the way.

48
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:22,301
And we stored the build on our server as raw files.

49
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:24,022
And whenever you would get an update,

50
00:02:24,042 --> 00:02:27,145
you would basically make an HTTP request for every single file.

51
00:02:27,725 --> 00:02:29,046
So we were DDoSing ourselves.

52
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:32,802
But Concerned Joe was a single-player puzzle game.

53
00:02:33,042 --> 00:02:34,963
And one night, I was like, what happens

54
00:02:35,184 --> 00:02:36,644
if we add three more players?

55
00:02:37,585 --> 00:02:40,186
And we did that, and we added a party mode to the game,

56
00:02:40,387 --> 00:02:42,568
where you basically had some mini-games

57
00:02:42,588 --> 00:02:45,069
where you would avoid falling blocks or pass bombs.

58
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,231
And I showed this version to friends,

59
00:02:47,691 --> 00:02:49,652
and friends really liked it.

60
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:51,853
And that was very interesting, because it

61
00:02:51,873 --> 00:02:54,955
was the kind of game you could enjoy with a crowd of people.

62
00:02:55,555 --> 00:02:56,616
So what I thought was, OK.

63
00:02:56,972 --> 00:03:01,537
I would take this party mode from Concern Joe and I would release it as a standalone

64
00:03:01,597 --> 00:03:02,898
title called Move or Die.

65
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:08,423
And my reasoning to doing this was many games are not remembered and this would allow Move

66
00:03:08,463 --> 00:03:12,407
or Die to grow on its own and it would also give us some practice of releasing a game

67
00:03:12,467 --> 00:03:14,729
before we release Concern Joe, the big game.

68
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,914
Spoiler alert, Concern Joe never got released and the focus completely went on Move or Die.

69
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:26,282
But yeah, the year is 2015 and after four years of working on it, we went through green light.

70
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:28,364
It took us around three weeks.

71
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:33,388
And in early 2015, in January, we hit early access.

72
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:37,431
And I've been told that you only get one release.

73
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:44,537
So this means that you either get a huge explosion during early access and then a smaller one when the game actually comes out, or the opposite.

74
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:50,486
are quite quiet during early access and then a big explosion during the final release.

75
00:03:51,327 --> 00:03:57,109
So I picked the second option and I priced the early access version of the game higher than the

76
00:03:57,149 --> 00:04:02,631
final release, which was quite an unusual thing, but I wanted to keep the entire early access period

77
00:04:03,271 --> 00:04:08,133
under a low profile. I didn't want to yell about it too much and I wanted to make it very clear

78
00:04:08,253 --> 00:04:14,495
that it's an unfinished game. So as a result, this was the main promotional video and I said things

79
00:04:14,535 --> 00:04:14,895
like this.

80
00:04:15,426 --> 00:04:19,628
If you want to play the game when it's polished and done, wait until it comes out of Early Access.

81
00:04:19,788 --> 00:04:21,109
Do not buy it now.

82
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:23,550
Check out the next video for some gameplay footage.

83
00:04:24,491 --> 00:04:25,671
Not sure if I'm pointing in the right way.

84
00:04:28,312 --> 00:04:32,615
And all the videos literally told you do not buy it now, which again, quite unusual.

85
00:04:33,637 --> 00:04:36,219
But yeah, it was in early access and I want to make it clear that it's unfinished.

86
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:40,382
So the first thing you would see when you open the game was this screen, and on this

87
00:04:40,402 --> 00:04:42,584
screen you would see the best contributors.

88
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:46,868
They were basically players who submitted a lot of bugs and we put their name on the

89
00:04:46,888 --> 00:04:47,488
splash screen.

90
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:52,432
Recent changes we made in the last patch, what we're working on, and my personal favorite,

91
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:57,616
a progress until release bar, which was a bar that I would manually update with each

92
00:04:57,696 --> 00:05:01,319
patch to give you an idea of how close you are to getting the final game.

93
00:05:01,806 --> 00:05:04,847
and it's a cool visual representation of a release date.

94
00:05:05,828 --> 00:05:07,869
But during Early Access, we released two updates,

95
00:05:07,929 --> 00:05:09,690
the Workshop update and the Sugar Rush update.

96
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,311
And the Workshop update was all about mods

97
00:05:12,571 --> 00:05:14,032
and user-generated content.

98
00:05:14,152 --> 00:05:18,153
So we released a level editor that was very user-friendly,

99
00:05:18,474 --> 00:05:19,934
and we encouraged mods.

100
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:22,375
So I made the whole process of making a new character

101
00:05:22,495 --> 00:05:24,416
super easy with trailers and all that.

102
00:05:25,277 --> 00:05:27,658
And even in the game, when you finish a match,

103
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:30,712
the game recommends you a mod, like, hey,

104
00:05:31,012 --> 00:05:33,133
check out this cool thing, because I think

105
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:33,993
that's a cool thing to do.

106
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,674
I also had a GDC talk about the polish in Move or Die

107
00:05:37,774 --> 00:05:39,835
around that time, and I think that kind of helped

108
00:05:39,975 --> 00:05:41,816
with spreading the word.

109
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:45,417
And we also started showcasing the game at various events.

110
00:05:45,917 --> 00:05:49,318
And because we did that, we went at PAX East in Boston,

111
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:51,879
and there we ran into Richard Hammer,

112
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,940
who played the game on the show floor,

113
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,201
and then later that night we ended up in his car.

114
00:05:56,778 --> 00:06:01,840
going to his Airbnb where we made a temporary live streaming setup where he played Move or Die live.

115
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:08,903
NortonLine played the game on the show floor and then he followed up with several videos about

116
00:06:08,943 --> 00:06:14,585
Move or Die that kind of totaled in around 400,000 views. And Jesse Cox also played the

117
00:06:14,605 --> 00:06:18,666
game on the show floor and during the co-optional podcast he kind of nodded his head.

118
00:06:18,886 --> 00:06:23,728
Uh, Move or Die. Oh yeah! Move or Die is fun. One year anniversary update. Twitch integration.

119
00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:25,008
Yeah.

120
00:06:25,856 --> 00:06:29,199
Also the Giant Bomb guys played the game and then they mentioned us on their panel.

121
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:33,924
One thing I really liked though is that I really liked at the AniMega booth was this thing called Move or Die.

122
00:06:34,404 --> 00:06:34,604
Woo!

123
00:06:35,345 --> 00:06:38,608
I think I got that on the subscreen.

124
00:06:38,628 --> 00:06:39,049
That was us.

125
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:46,456
But yeah, and also during events we gave out promotional cards and some guys tried to sell those on eBay for $28.

126
00:06:47,036 --> 00:06:48,237
So it's kind of a compliment.

127
00:06:50,472 --> 00:06:52,473
But yeah, the release day came around,

128
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:54,575
and we released the game in early 2016.

129
00:06:54,955 --> 00:06:57,397
So we spent one year in early access.

130
00:06:57,497 --> 00:07:00,119
And for those of you who haven't experienced this yet,

131
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:02,180
this is how it feels to release your game.

132
00:07:03,101 --> 00:07:03,822
Check this out.

133
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:15,691
So yeah, version 1.0.

134
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:16,331
It went live.

135
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:20,159
We added a lot of features to make kind of a build-up.

136
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,801
We added a leveling up system, new game modes,

137
00:07:22,861 --> 00:07:25,603
new characters, and we ended up on the front page of Steam,

138
00:07:25,623 --> 00:07:26,743
which was mind-blowing.

139
00:07:28,044 --> 00:07:29,905
And we also got assigned a Metacritic score.

140
00:07:30,005 --> 00:07:31,106
Now, for those of you who don't know,

141
00:07:31,266 --> 00:07:32,727
Metacritic score is kind of an average

142
00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:34,748
of like some reviews out there.

143
00:07:35,268 --> 00:07:36,609
And in order to get a Metacritic score,

144
00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:38,730
you need a minimum amount of reviews,

145
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,451
and that minimum amount is four,

146
00:07:40,871 --> 00:07:42,372
which is exactly the number we got.

147
00:07:42,532 --> 00:07:44,994
And because most of them were positive,

148
00:07:45,054 --> 00:07:46,034
we ended up with a score of 80.

149
00:07:47,276 --> 00:07:51,677
That makes us as good as Elite Dangerous and better than Kingdom Come Deliverance,

150
00:07:53,017 --> 00:07:54,277
based on what Metacritic says.

151
00:07:55,377 --> 00:07:58,338
And that's how the sales chart looked during release.

152
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,418
I don't have to point out where the game came out.

153
00:08:00,818 --> 00:08:01,619
It was very obvious.

154
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:03,899
But even though the game was doing quite well,

155
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:06,839
I wasn't happy because the game was kind of rushed

156
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,280
and it still lacked in certain aspects.

157
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,921
So I had these four pillars that I wanted to fix about the game,

158
00:08:14,001 --> 00:08:15,041
which was content,

159
00:08:15,575 --> 00:08:18,336
replay value, online gameplay, and marketing.

160
00:08:19,156 --> 00:08:21,017
And so the updates era started.

161
00:08:21,597 --> 00:08:24,118
And I wanted to maintain the game with updates

162
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:27,739
with the no paid DLC mentality.

163
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,939
And I wanted to really stick to that.

164
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:34,000
So back then, I was looking at what Team Fortress was doing.

165
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,901
And they had these very cool updates

166
00:08:36,061 --> 00:08:39,762
that had their own logo, their own website, a tiny trailer.

167
00:08:39,882 --> 00:08:41,782
And all the features were presented super nicely

168
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:42,583
on that website.

169
00:08:43,363 --> 00:08:43,483
So.

170
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,141
We started working on the first update, which

171
00:08:46,201 --> 00:08:49,083
was focused on fixing the replay value problems of the game.

172
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:52,405
And so the Mutators update was released in March.

173
00:08:52,805 --> 00:08:56,108
And the Mutators update was all about adding

174
00:08:56,368 --> 00:08:59,870
mutators that add new mechanics to the game as you're playing.

175
00:09:00,531 --> 00:09:03,373
And the game was kind of getting popular

176
00:09:03,473 --> 00:09:04,674
with YouTubers back then.

177
00:09:04,994 --> 00:09:08,076
I also ended up on local television for some reason.

178
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,431
And a lot of YouTubers play the game, so what I figured I could do for the trailer was to

179
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:17,593
get snippets from their gameplay videos and kinda match those snippets up to the game's

180
00:09:17,673 --> 00:09:18,133
soundtrack.

181
00:09:18,633 --> 00:09:19,994
So I'm gonna just play you that trailer.

182
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:51,566
So, yeah, I also think it's important to show how players react to your game, not only gameplay

183
00:09:51,586 --> 00:09:51,866
footage.

184
00:09:52,446 --> 00:09:55,507
Also, in terms of content, we added, like, new game modes, new characters.

185
00:09:55,908 --> 00:09:57,869
And in terms of online, we added the ability

186
00:09:57,909 --> 00:10:01,070
to join ongoing matches, more local players in online games,

187
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,911
and a friends list.

188
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:04,112
And in terms of marketing, we managed

189
00:10:04,132 --> 00:10:05,753
to get some announcers for the game,

190
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:07,714
like the YouTuber Critical, Brutal Muse,

191
00:10:08,014 --> 00:10:09,415
and a random Japanese guy.

192
00:10:10,595 --> 00:10:13,577
And those were quite fun, because these updates kind

193
00:10:13,617 --> 00:10:16,418
of covered all those pillars, not just one.

194
00:10:17,098 --> 00:10:18,279
And I also wanted to make.

195
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:22,202
every trailer end kind of in the same way. So I'm just gonna show you that.

196
00:10:22,482 --> 00:10:26,044
What the hell? Oh my god, I forgot to move!

197
00:10:26,064 --> 00:10:35,749
This is the Mutator update. All of this already in your Steam library right now. Available now on Steam.

198
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:40,132
So I wanted to make it very clear that this update is completely free and it's already in

199
00:10:40,152 --> 00:10:45,154
your Steam library. And so we started working on the next update which was the viewers versus

200
00:10:45,174 --> 00:10:45,815
streamers update.

201
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,733
And this was all about marketing.

202
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:49,334
Again, I'm just gonna play you the trailer.

203
00:10:49,594 --> 00:10:51,915
Aren't you tired of just watching streamers

204
00:10:51,975 --> 00:10:53,356
play games on Twitch?

205
00:10:53,636 --> 00:10:56,037
What if you could actually influence their game

206
00:10:56,217 --> 00:10:57,778
while they are playing it live?

207
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,940
Everything you type shows up in the game.

208
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,121
Pick what game modes a streamer will play.

209
00:11:04,241 --> 00:11:05,862
Vote for upcoming mutators.

210
00:11:06,162 --> 00:11:08,443
Try to kill the streamer by using lasers.

211
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,059
So while I was working on this update,

212
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:13,839
I saw what Choice Chamber was doing,

213
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:16,480
which was, I think, the first game that did this thing.

214
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,480
And I kind of combined that with that flash game

215
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,041
I mentioned where you punch your keyboard.

216
00:11:20,361 --> 00:11:23,201
So I took the keyboard layout and I mapped it on the screen

217
00:11:23,321 --> 00:11:25,862
and I made a game mode where a Twitch viewer,

218
00:11:25,982 --> 00:11:28,922
if he presses a key, he would drop a bomb

219
00:11:29,102 --> 00:11:30,323
on that spot on the screen.

220
00:11:30,663 --> 00:11:33,743
And we tested that for the first time during PAX live

221
00:11:33,963 --> 00:11:36,224
on the Twitch stage with like 10,000 live viewers

222
00:11:37,004 --> 00:11:37,924
and it looked something like this.

223
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:47,052
Just run! They can't get us all!

224
00:11:47,112 --> 00:11:48,493
I guess they can get us all.

225
00:11:48,513 --> 00:11:51,256
So yeah, that was fun and he didn't catch on fire, so that was good.

226
00:11:52,036 --> 00:11:56,100
We also reached out to some other developers and we managed to get cameo characters

227
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,682
like Shovel Knight, the Twitch logo and the Newgrounds character.

228
00:11:59,369 --> 00:12:01,811
We managed to get Eager Raptor as an announcer in the game,

229
00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:03,472
and we added a new mutator.

230
00:12:03,632 --> 00:12:05,314
And also, I was playing Heavy Bullets,

231
00:12:05,374 --> 00:12:06,875
which is a really cool game, and I really

232
00:12:06,895 --> 00:12:07,655
like the mechanic of it.

233
00:12:07,755 --> 00:12:10,437
And I asked the developer if I can adapt that mechanic

234
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:12,799
in a move or die game mode, and he said yes.

235
00:12:12,979 --> 00:12:15,381
And so the Heavy Bullets game mode was introduced.

236
00:12:16,021 --> 00:12:17,723
Also, around this time, I've sent

237
00:12:18,123 --> 00:12:21,485
Justin Roiland, the creator of Rick and Morty, an email

238
00:12:21,645 --> 00:12:24,087
asking if we can use their characters in the game.

239
00:12:24,808 --> 00:12:27,089
And we started working on the next update, which

240
00:12:27,169 --> 00:12:28,270
was the Toxic update.

241
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:31,070
And this one was all about the online.

242
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:33,411
So we added an online chat emote,

243
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,473
so you can taunt your fellow players.

244
00:12:36,373 --> 00:12:38,034
Host migration, AFK, AI bots,

245
00:12:38,054 --> 00:12:40,336
we basically made the whole online experience much better.

246
00:12:40,356 --> 00:12:42,337
In terms of content and replay value,

247
00:12:42,357 --> 00:12:43,958
we added new characters, new game modes,

248
00:12:44,238 --> 00:12:45,519
mutators and all that stuff.

249
00:12:46,319 --> 00:12:49,041
And around this time, Vodafone reached out to us

250
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:51,943
asking if we're interested in being featured

251
00:12:52,103 --> 00:12:53,864
in one of their ads where like a kid

252
00:12:53,904 --> 00:12:55,285
would play Move or Die on his tablet

253
00:12:55,345 --> 00:12:56,766
and the parents came in the room.

254
00:12:57,311 --> 00:12:58,953
and we were trying to explain to them that MoverDie

255
00:12:58,993 --> 00:13:01,916
is not on tablets, and they ended up going with

256
00:13:01,977 --> 00:13:04,299
Pokemon Go in the end, so yeah, that was a thing.

257
00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:04,800
I don't know.

258
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:08,204
But after this, my personal favorite update came out

259
00:13:08,244 --> 00:13:09,806
called the Best Value Update.

260
00:13:09,866 --> 00:13:13,450
So we were really stupid and we decided to make an update

261
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:16,594
with an infomercial themed to it, so this is the trailer.

262
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:20,967
Aren't you tired of waiting around for a new move or die update?

263
00:13:21,127 --> 00:13:25,809
Don't you wish there would be a new update announcement with a thematically mocking trailer?

264
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:27,810
Well, it's your lucky day.

265
00:13:28,071 --> 00:13:29,952
We have exactly what you need.

266
00:13:30,152 --> 00:13:33,053
And what you need is the best value update.

267
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:37,856
Just to understand what you saw there, it was stock footage that I paid money for

268
00:13:37,876 --> 00:13:41,858
to remove the watermark and re-add my own watermark saying stock footage.

269
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:44,439
So yeah, in terms of content and replay value,

270
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:47,221
we added a lot of mutators and some game modes.

271
00:13:47,591 --> 00:13:51,253
including the VVVVV mutator, again with approval.

272
00:13:51,853 --> 00:13:55,134
In terms of online, we added an abandoned cool down,

273
00:13:55,474 --> 00:13:57,595
various improvements, and in terms of marketing,

274
00:13:57,635 --> 00:13:59,396
we got Lillipitchu as a voice actor.

275
00:14:00,197 --> 00:14:02,278
And even though the other updates were completely free,

276
00:14:02,678 --> 00:14:05,919
this one was free 99, and we did a really stupid thing

277
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:08,200
where I went on Google and I found a service

278
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,222
where I could buy a hotline, so I bought a hotline.

279
00:14:11,902 --> 00:14:13,923
And it sounds like this when you actually call it.

280
00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:19,155
Welcome to the Move or Die Best Value Hotline.

281
00:14:19,595 --> 00:14:21,336
You weren't sure if that number was real.

282
00:14:21,676 --> 00:14:23,237
For one second, you thought,

283
00:14:23,617 --> 00:14:27,199
Nah, they couldn't possibly register a phone number.

284
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:28,140
Could they?

285
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,121
Well, yes we can.

286
00:14:30,421 --> 00:14:31,241
And we did.

287
00:14:32,142 --> 00:14:34,883
And a lot of players called that hotline

288
00:14:35,063 --> 00:14:37,825
and they left us very interesting voice messages.

289
00:14:38,225 --> 00:14:39,966
And I'm just going to play some of them.

290
00:14:40,406 --> 00:14:42,667
I love the fact that you can move or die.

291
00:14:43,191 --> 00:14:44,011
Go f*** yourself.

292
00:14:44,411 --> 00:14:46,992
By far, the best ad for a game.

293
00:14:47,072 --> 00:14:48,793
I just bought the 4-pack because of this.

294
00:14:48,853 --> 00:14:52,575
Hey, so uh, I think you should give me this game for free.

295
00:14:53,155 --> 00:14:55,656
Uh, my name in Steam is Hun-

296
00:14:55,836 --> 00:14:56,996
You guys got a...

297
00:14:57,256 --> 00:14:57,737
What?

298
00:14:58,657 --> 00:15:01,098
Wait, what number is this?

299
00:15:01,118 --> 00:15:03,859
Why? Why did you guys feel that this was a good idea?

300
00:15:04,895 --> 00:15:06,516
So we still don't know why that was a good idea.

301
00:15:06,536 --> 00:15:07,376
But it's my favorite thing.

302
00:15:08,017 --> 00:15:09,717
Also, around this time, we were contacted

303
00:15:09,777 --> 00:15:13,039
by a random Chinese company basically asking us

304
00:15:13,219 --> 00:15:16,220
if we're interested in selling them the Moveboard IP

305
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,602
so they can add it as some sort of loading screen

306
00:15:19,622 --> 00:15:21,803
to their game because their game is very stressful

307
00:15:21,883 --> 00:15:24,404
and they wanted their players to play a relaxing game

308
00:15:24,444 --> 00:15:25,404
during the loading screens.

309
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:28,109
Yeah, okay.

310
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,150
And finally, the last update for 2016

311
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,311
was the non-denominational winter holiday update,

312
00:15:34,671 --> 00:15:35,772
which was very inclusive,

313
00:15:35,892 --> 00:15:37,712
and this was all about replay value.

314
00:15:38,392 --> 00:15:40,473
We added themes, you can finally play like 2v2.

315
00:15:41,053 --> 00:15:43,354
In terms of content, we added a lot of game modes,

316
00:15:43,594 --> 00:15:45,255
and one of my personal favorites,

317
00:15:46,135 --> 00:15:49,316
the super hot game mode, again, with approval.

318
00:15:50,736 --> 00:15:52,077
A lot of characters, meat-eaters,

319
00:15:52,457 --> 00:15:55,458
and around this time, we found out that at TwitchCon,

320
00:15:55,718 --> 00:15:56,198
a shack.

321
00:15:56,783 --> 00:15:59,964
played Move or Die on stage while Snoop Dogg was watching.

322
00:16:01,185 --> 00:16:01,985
That was a thing.

323
00:16:03,285 --> 00:16:04,906
So that was 2016 for Move or Die.

324
00:16:05,026 --> 00:16:06,567
All those updates in one year.

325
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:10,308
And then in early 2017, we hit the first year anniversary

326
00:16:10,408 --> 00:16:10,728
update.

327
00:16:10,748 --> 00:16:13,229
So this was, we even made some cool, cute art

328
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,590
with the characters going on an adventure.

329
00:16:16,171 --> 00:16:17,471
And during this time, we had 105,000 crashes,

330
00:16:17,511 --> 00:16:17,751
100,000 crashes.

331
00:16:22,163 --> 00:16:25,684
We pushed 106 patches, we got around 300 key requests

332
00:16:26,144 --> 00:16:29,745
on email and the game was pirated by 44.7% of players,

333
00:16:30,505 --> 00:16:31,305
which is perfectly fine.

334
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:32,466
I made the game so people can play it,

335
00:16:32,486 --> 00:16:33,666
so I'm perfectly okay with that.

336
00:16:34,366 --> 00:16:36,347
So that was our one-year anniversary,

337
00:16:36,947 --> 00:16:40,188
and around this time, Justin replied to my email

338
00:16:40,308 --> 00:16:41,969
and he basically said, okay, you can do this.

339
00:16:42,249 --> 00:16:43,569
You can use Rick and Morty as a character.

340
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:49,022
And an important thing that I did that I think is very important to to get these things was I showed them

341
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:55,146
How Rick would look in the game with that initial email so they can basically trust us with their IP

342
00:16:55,527 --> 00:16:58,528
And I also showed him that we handled other IPs like Shovel Knight

343
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,730
so he said we can use it, but

344
00:17:02,651 --> 00:17:08,635
Only if we release on the 28th of June they were basically building hype for their season 3 and

345
00:17:08,675 --> 00:17:11,497
The problem was that the steam summer sale started on June 22nd

346
00:17:11,537 --> 00:17:12,738
So this would mean that

347
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:17,256
the game would go on sale and we wouldn't have any content to show.

348
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:24,322
So we said yes, we did that, Rick and Morty, the Rick and Morty update was released and

349
00:17:24,363 --> 00:17:29,447
it was obviously all about marketing, we made a really quick video with a cool splash screen

350
00:17:29,487 --> 00:17:33,711
showcasing how the characters would look like and a lot of press picked up on this.

351
00:17:34,131 --> 00:17:39,576
Apparently we were doing the same thing with other games like Gang Beasts and Rocket League

352
00:17:39,936 --> 00:17:40,336
and because of

353
00:17:40,857 --> 00:17:43,799
that we had the only cool video about this.

354
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:47,901
So we kind of ended up being the focus of those press releases.

355
00:17:48,642 --> 00:17:50,663
And a lot of press websites cover that.

356
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:52,944
So just to give you an idea, usually

357
00:17:52,984 --> 00:17:55,246
when you go on sale during the summer or the winter sale,

358
00:17:55,546 --> 00:17:57,087
you get one big spike at the beginning

359
00:17:57,227 --> 00:17:58,908
and then another spike at the end

360
00:17:58,948 --> 00:18:01,629
when people remember that they should buy the game because it's

361
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:02,190
on a discount.

362
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:07,051
This is how that graph looked with the Rick and Morty update.

363
00:18:07,491 --> 00:18:10,553
We managed to create an even bigger spike in the middle of the sale,

364
00:18:10,573 --> 00:18:11,754
so this was super important.

365
00:18:13,315 --> 00:18:16,577
Later that year, we released the Discord update,

366
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:20,739
which we basically partnered with the guys over at Discord.

367
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:21,840
It was all about marketing.

368
00:18:23,021 --> 00:18:26,042
We added some cool features where you can invite friends through Discord,

369
00:18:26,163 --> 00:18:30,145
and we also added their characters as playable characters in MoverDi,

370
00:18:30,185 --> 00:18:30,785
and they're adorable.

371
00:18:31,814 --> 00:18:37,097
And after that in December of 2017, we released the green and gold update.

372
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:40,920
And this was basically the biggest update that we've ever made for Move or Die.

373
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,623
It was all about online and replay, and the theme was kind of greed.

374
00:18:47,404 --> 00:18:51,266
And we made the trailer into a sort of a Christmas carol thing.

375
00:18:51,846 --> 00:18:55,870
Old man Nick's face did not seem that frightened. That sounds pretty good

376
00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:02,376
He said with excitement without any doubt or sense of remorse. He started to make a new update, of course

377
00:19:03,057 --> 00:19:05,399
And yes, I am writing code on a piece of paper

378
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:11,725
But yeah, we we added our own in-game currency and our own in-game store

379
00:19:12,265 --> 00:19:17,610
And because we don't have any micro transactions, we called it not a store and the currency is called not coins

380
00:19:18,732 --> 00:19:22,457
And to make it very clear to the players that we don't take real money

381
00:19:22,858 --> 00:19:26,563
The first time you open the store this video plays in the game

382
00:19:27,393 --> 00:19:30,155
Okay, so you just clicked on something that we like to call not a store.

383
00:19:30,215 --> 00:19:32,897
Now, I know what you're thinking and I want to make this very clear.

384
00:19:33,037 --> 00:19:36,019
There's absolutely no microtransactions in the entire game.

385
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:40,823
This means that there's no way for you to pay real-world money to unlock any kind of content in the game.

386
00:19:40,943 --> 00:19:45,026
And we intend to keep it that way because just like you, we f***ing hate microtransactions.

387
00:19:45,126 --> 00:19:48,708
And that's why the design of the game hasn't been changed at all by this new addition,

388
00:19:48,728 --> 00:19:50,849
nor have the drop rates when you actually level up.

389
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,712
That's why we like to call this section not a store and the in-game currency not coin.

390
00:19:56,252 --> 00:19:56,992
So yeah, that was the thing.

391
00:19:57,452 --> 00:20:03,714
And we also allowed mods online to encourage more user-generated content.

392
00:20:04,594 --> 00:20:10,215
And in terms of content, we added game modes, mutators, characters, and that was 2017.

393
00:20:11,876 --> 00:20:17,277
Less action than 2016, but still we maintained some updates.

394
00:20:17,337 --> 00:20:20,858
And now 2018 came around and we got our second year anniversary.

395
00:20:22,705 --> 00:20:27,427
This time I made a really quick trailer showcasing the entire evolution of Move or Die.

396
00:20:27,507 --> 00:20:32,708
Apparently you can do a thing where you can map all the files that you change in real time

397
00:20:33,349 --> 00:20:37,390
if you use some sort of source control. And I did that and it looks super interesting.

398
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:41,071
Everything you see there, every blue dot is like a file that we're changing.

399
00:20:41,351 --> 00:20:47,873
And we also added some consumables where players could basically, it's kind of the end game,

400
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:51,254
you can get some cool cosmetic stuff on your characters like set them on fire.

401
00:20:51,978 --> 00:20:54,320
And I recorded the sound effect for that in my basement.

402
00:20:55,941 --> 00:20:56,702
Not a good idea.

403
00:20:57,082 --> 00:20:59,304
But yeah, during our two-year journey,

404
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,445
we managed to get over 500,000 players.

405
00:21:00,465 --> 00:21:01,746
The game crashed 240, 100, yeah, a lot of times.

406
00:21:02,226 --> 00:21:03,887
And the piracy rate dropped from 44% to 37.3%.

407
00:21:03,927 --> 00:21:04,968
I don't know why, but it did.

408
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:08,111
And this is how the overall sales graph looked from the.

409
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,682
game getting early access to basically today.

410
00:21:24,402 --> 00:21:25,763
And during this period of two years,

411
00:21:25,843 --> 00:21:28,564
we released a lot of updates,

412
00:21:28,664 --> 00:21:29,905
and all of them completely free.

413
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:32,646
And some interesting things happened in this period,

414
00:21:32,686 --> 00:21:35,547
like players play the game in cinemas,

415
00:21:35,887 --> 00:21:37,368
which is still quite unusual.

416
00:21:37,788 --> 00:21:40,549
We ended up being featured in the Blue Air Magazine.

417
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:41,729
I still don't know why.

418
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,771
And some weird French quiz website

419
00:21:44,831 --> 00:21:47,452
stole our character as a loading page.

420
00:21:48,232 --> 00:21:49,013
That's still a thing.

421
00:21:50,287 --> 00:21:55,091
So I can finally say that I managed to address those pillars that bothered me when the game

422
00:21:55,131 --> 00:22:00,635
came out and after two years of development I was finally happy with the game and it was

423
00:22:00,895 --> 00:22:07,160
in a place where I could be proud of it and I could show it to people. But I'm still not sure

424
00:22:07,241 --> 00:22:12,465
why the game was popular and why the game did as well as it did. So I asked people, I made a

425
00:22:12,525 --> 00:22:17,749
YouTube video asking people why they bought Move or Die or why they think the game was successful

426
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,390
and we got a lot of replies.

427
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:22,094
Some of them said that it's the concept.

428
00:22:22,614 --> 00:22:25,175
Others said that it's because we don't have microtransactions,

429
00:22:25,255 --> 00:22:28,577
or because we have mods, or the art, or all these things.

430
00:22:29,297 --> 00:22:32,519
And some players even made videos answering that question.

431
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:36,220
I think the successfulness of Move or Die came from how you advertised it.

432
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,902
All of your videos were either incredibly hilarious,

433
00:22:39,162 --> 00:22:40,883
or showed people actually having fun.

434
00:22:41,023 --> 00:22:44,324
There wasn't any Nintendo canned family fun on the couch bullshit.

435
00:22:44,484 --> 00:22:45,965
And I saw Rick and Morton, and I was like,

436
00:22:45,985 --> 00:22:47,046
hey, that's pretty good.

437
00:22:47,126 --> 00:22:48,866
And then I bought the game.

438
00:22:50,075 --> 00:22:53,258
I like those little details in the game, like the character's face is changing depending

439
00:22:53,298 --> 00:22:56,660
on their life bar, the little splashes when you die which don't necessarily add something

440
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,221
to the gameplay.

441
00:22:57,241 --> 00:22:59,243
I love the developers' closeness to the community.

442
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:02,285
And for the PC, it pretty much became THE Steam Party game.

443
00:23:03,106 --> 00:23:09,391
So yeah, we got all these reasons that are more or less valid, but I noticed one specific

444
00:23:09,451 --> 00:23:15,076
trend in those comments, which was that a lot of players mentioned that it was basically

445
00:23:15,136 --> 00:23:16,918
because of us, because the developers.

446
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:22,675
Some said it's because the way we treat our players, or because how funny we are, or the videos we make.

447
00:23:23,656 --> 00:23:27,799
And yeah, it's not one thing. I realize that it's not one thing that I can pinpoint.

448
00:23:27,879 --> 00:23:30,120
It's like the collection of a million tiny things.

449
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:35,804
And it's scary because I have to recreate the success of Move or Die for my next project,

450
00:23:35,945 --> 00:23:43,890
and I'm still not 100% sure how to do that, especially because there's also some non-trivial amount of luck involved in making a successful game.

451
00:23:44,411 --> 00:23:44,531
So...

452
00:23:44,987 --> 00:23:50,611
And after all those comments and after this entire journey, the conclusion I reached and

453
00:23:50,811 --> 00:23:57,075
I guess the takeaway would be that both you and me, we should be the developers that we

454
00:23:57,095 --> 00:23:58,376
would support as gamers.

455
00:23:59,717 --> 00:24:00,017
Thank you.

456
00:24:08,743 --> 00:24:12,545
So even though I had 180 slides, I managed to make it on time.

457
00:24:12,946 --> 00:24:14,186
Do we have time for questions?

458
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:19,150
Yes, so if there are any questions, now is the time.

459
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:32,381
Hello.

460
00:24:37,846 --> 00:24:42,650
Are there any mutators that you had to just throw away that just?

461
00:24:43,975 --> 00:24:45,815
that is interesting enough to talk about?

462
00:24:46,335 --> 00:24:46,716
I had...

463
00:24:47,836 --> 00:24:50,537
So, because Move or Die is kind of a platform

464
00:24:50,577 --> 00:24:52,017
where I can just throw ideas

465
00:24:52,077 --> 00:24:55,278
because it has this format of random minigames,

466
00:24:55,298 --> 00:24:56,519
I had a lot of stupid ideas

467
00:24:56,539 --> 00:24:58,319
that would only work in specific scenarios.

468
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:00,200
For example, I really wanted to make a mutator

469
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:03,401
where you would get swapped

470
00:25:03,421 --> 00:25:06,222
to what character you're controlling,

471
00:25:06,702 --> 00:25:08,883
and you would have to steal someone else's controller

472
00:25:08,923 --> 00:25:10,483
and figure out if that's your character or not.

473
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,721
But this would only work in a local game.

474
00:25:12,781 --> 00:25:15,182
It wouldn't work online, so I kind of had to give that up.

475
00:25:16,002 --> 00:25:16,522
So yes.

476
00:25:18,463 --> 00:25:18,723
Hello.

477
00:25:20,084 --> 00:25:20,844
Hi.

478
00:25:20,924 --> 00:25:24,105
I'm wondering if you could tell us about online versus local

479
00:25:24,145 --> 00:25:25,946
co-op, or sorry, local multiplayer,

480
00:25:25,986 --> 00:25:29,648
and how that impacted your sales or your reception.

481
00:25:30,148 --> 00:25:32,709
It's tricky because I released Move or Die

482
00:25:32,729 --> 00:25:35,510
with an online multiplayer mod, and I

483
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,731
don't have a frame of reference of how

484
00:25:37,771 --> 00:25:38,952
the game would do without it.

485
00:25:39,592 --> 00:25:43,593
So I feel like it's very important to have online in your party game because otherwise

486
00:25:43,613 --> 00:25:50,677
there are so many local games out there and I think this online aspect brings a very valuable

487
00:25:50,997 --> 00:25:52,017
element to your game work.

488
00:25:52,237 --> 00:25:55,439
Not a lot of people have friends to invite over.

489
00:25:55,639 --> 00:25:57,200
So yeah, I think that's very important.

490
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:01,942
In our case, we made our own engine, so adding online was a pain in the ass, but I think

491
00:26:01,982 --> 00:26:02,542
it was worth it.

492
00:26:02,582 --> 00:26:04,963
So I'd say yes, definitely go for online if you can.

493
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:13,398
When you talk about getting things like a super hot mutator or a VVVV mutator,

494
00:26:14,338 --> 00:26:21,125
what is the process that you went through to get those and how is that different from getting Rick and Morty in the game?

495
00:26:21,325 --> 00:26:24,708
It's no different at all. I literally send people an email.

496
00:26:24,968 --> 00:26:30,293
It's people I look up to and I like what they're doing and I want to collaborate in a way or another.

497
00:26:31,398 --> 00:26:38,324
And I think an important part of getting those collaborations is to show people that they can trust you with their work with their

498
00:26:38,584 --> 00:26:40,806
Baby, basically because that was their game and their ideas

499
00:26:41,306 --> 00:26:48,191
So that's why I showed Justin how Rick would look in the game even so I'd spend the time of developing that character

500
00:26:48,412 --> 00:26:55,097
Before I send that email. So basically they can understand that. Okay, these guys maybe know what they're doing

501
00:26:55,897 --> 00:26:57,839
It's not a guaranteed. Yes, but I feel like it

502
00:26:59,138 --> 00:27:02,561
skyrockets your chances of getting that done.

503
00:27:03,141 --> 00:27:04,162
So yeah, literally an email.

504
00:27:04,743 --> 00:27:05,063
Thank you.

505
00:27:05,343 --> 00:27:05,603
Thank you.

506
00:27:07,945 --> 00:27:08,165
Hi.

507
00:27:08,465 --> 00:27:09,026
Hello.

508
00:27:09,446 --> 00:27:13,449
So obviously you made a stand about

509
00:27:13,469 --> 00:27:15,551
how you're gonna sell your game with all free updates

510
00:27:15,631 --> 00:27:19,453
and no paid content, except for the initial purchase.

511
00:27:19,974 --> 00:27:20,134
Yeah.

512
00:27:20,734 --> 00:27:22,976
Could you, would you be willing to elaborate

513
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,918
like how you think that worked out for you financially?

514
00:27:26,404 --> 00:27:28,185
Was that a good investment for two years?

515
00:27:28,345 --> 00:27:33,007
I would say yes. The game, surprisingly, is still selling and it's still doing well.

516
00:27:33,247 --> 00:27:38,449
It's doing almost as well as it did when it came out initially.

517
00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:40,150
I mean, there's no obvious...

518
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:47,032
I don't know, it's not getting worse over time or if it is, it's not obvious enough.

519
00:27:47,652 --> 00:27:50,694
And the majority of sales happen during discounts,

520
00:27:50,854 --> 00:27:53,375
like summer sale, winter sale, you get huge spikes.

521
00:27:53,913 --> 00:27:56,755
But I think it helped to keep those updates going

522
00:27:56,815 --> 00:27:59,436
because players get that feeling that the game is still

523
00:27:59,476 --> 00:28:01,357
being worked on and it's not a dead thing

524
00:28:01,377 --> 00:28:04,419
they just buy and then throw away after a few hours.

525
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:09,221
So again, I cannot quantify the importance of the update.

526
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:12,002
I can only go by gut feel and tell you

527
00:28:12,042 --> 00:28:13,523
that I think it's worth it.

528
00:28:14,864 --> 00:28:17,625
I did it part because I wanted to keep the game updated,

529
00:28:17,725 --> 00:28:19,366
but also because I wasn't happy with the game.

530
00:28:19,386 --> 00:28:21,407
So I wanted to bring it to a point where I'm happy with it.

531
00:28:22,226 --> 00:28:24,607
But yeah, I'm not sure what I'm going to do with any future game.

532
00:28:25,067 --> 00:28:27,048
I'm still not a fan of microtransactions.

533
00:28:27,368 --> 00:28:27,888
So yeah.

534
00:28:29,129 --> 00:28:29,369
Thank you.

535
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:36,232
So being independent and mostly by yourself, how did you find you kind of kept yourself

536
00:28:36,512 --> 00:28:40,373
motivated during the initial development, especially doing things like online or things

537
00:28:40,393 --> 00:28:43,615
that aren't necessarily as interested in as other parts of it?

538
00:28:44,177 --> 00:28:48,978
Right, that was the tricky part because we are a super small team from all over the world

539
00:28:49,138 --> 00:28:52,039
and in the beginning it was just me and a friend of mine working on the game.

540
00:28:52,659 --> 00:28:57,381
So we wore a lot of hats and when you're working remotely with people online you start questioning

541
00:28:57,421 --> 00:29:00,822
yourself and asking yourself like, hey, is it worth it what I'm doing here?

542
00:29:01,962 --> 00:29:06,003
So a huge source of motivation for me was going to events and showcasing the game and

543
00:29:06,043 --> 00:29:09,624
see people play the game and having fun and smiling.

544
00:29:10,465 --> 00:29:12,245
And that was mind-blowing because that told me that.

545
00:29:12,777 --> 00:29:16,838
Yes, I should keep going, I should keep developing the game and release it at one point because

546
00:29:17,238 --> 00:29:21,819
people enjoy it and it's that question that are you doing it for yourself, are you doing

547
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:22,959
it for the players?

548
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:29,361
So yeah, it was one of the trickiest thing, keeping myself motivated and I think it would

549
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:34,622
help a lot working with other people in the same room and be able to bounce ideas off

550
00:29:34,642 --> 00:29:35,083
of each other.

551
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:36,503
So yeah.

552
00:29:38,063 --> 00:29:38,263
Thank you.

553
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:40,559
Hey, hello.

554
00:29:40,719 --> 00:29:43,060
So as a developer, how do you decide

555
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,942
when your game is ready to be on the access?

556
00:29:48,482 --> 00:29:49,843
Especially as a developer,

557
00:29:49,903 --> 00:29:51,984
you will never think that your game is ready.

558
00:29:52,304 --> 00:29:55,305
You will always know that you have to keep adding things

559
00:29:55,665 --> 00:29:58,947
and you basically either have to have a lot of,

560
00:30:01,488 --> 00:30:03,408
I don't know, self control and understand

561
00:30:03,448 --> 00:30:04,849
that you have to release this thing

562
00:30:05,149 --> 00:30:06,830
because like it's a financial decision.

563
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,481
or have someone from the outside come in and look at your game,

564
00:30:09,802 --> 00:30:13,263
someone who doesn't know all the tiny cracks and problems

565
00:30:13,303 --> 00:30:15,864
that only you can see, and basically have them tell you

566
00:30:15,884 --> 00:30:17,765
that, OK, this is good enough to get out there.

567
00:30:18,085 --> 00:30:20,947
In our case, we went with early access, not because I wanted to,

568
00:30:20,987 --> 00:30:22,728
but it was a financial decision.

569
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:25,469
We needed that extra money to keep developing the game.

570
00:30:26,169 --> 00:30:27,830
Otherwise, I wouldn't do that again.

571
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:32,192
But yeah, from my point of view, you can put out a game anytime,

572
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:33,793
especially with early access now,

573
00:30:33,893 --> 00:30:35,594
as long as you make it clear that it's unfinished

574
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:36,634
and you're still working on it.

575
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:43,914
Players understand and people at conventions understood that the game was crashing because we're still working on it

576
00:30:43,934 --> 00:30:48,257
So yeah, the sooner the better. Thank you. Thank you

577
00:30:50,999 --> 00:30:53,701
Any plans to move to other platforms

578
00:30:55,102 --> 00:30:59,786
Yes, not I don't know if with move or die with move or die right now. We're porting it on consoles

579
00:31:00,126 --> 00:31:04,269
It's kind of weird that it's a party game on PC and it's doing well

580
00:31:04,698 --> 00:31:09,922
It's kind of counterintuitive and we want to bring it to consoles because that's the natural place for a party game.

581
00:31:10,723 --> 00:31:16,668
I wouldn't see it on mobile because personally I'm not a fan of games that are adapted to another

582
00:31:16,788 --> 00:31:21,412
platform that was designed for a different kind of gameplay. So I definitely want to explore

583
00:31:21,452 --> 00:31:26,416
different platforms but with different projects. For example I'm a fan of games where the gameplay

584
00:31:26,436 --> 00:31:30,740
happens outside the screen so I would be curious to make a mobile game where the gameplay happens

585
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,902
like socially with the people around you.

586
00:31:33,704 --> 00:31:38,666
So yes, absolutely, but I'm not a fan of adapting stuff and like forcing them.

587
00:31:38,906 --> 00:31:44,949
Cool. I love the marketing. Did you do this by yourself or did you have an agency or other people?

588
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:52,252
It was part myself and later in development I teamed up with other people like that guy there, Rick.

589
00:31:52,472 --> 00:31:54,993
He did most of the logos for the updates.

590
00:31:56,254 --> 00:32:01,637
And I think that's important because I kind of go in like one direction style-wise.

591
00:32:02,165 --> 00:32:04,166
So it was helpful to team up with someone else who

592
00:32:04,186 --> 00:32:07,648
can handle these other marketing tasks

593
00:32:07,668 --> 00:32:09,469
so I can focus on actual development.

594
00:32:10,089 --> 00:32:13,591
But it was all done by my team, so to speak.

595
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:17,553
I had a publisher that was in charge of putting out

596
00:32:17,593 --> 00:32:18,253
press releases.

597
00:32:18,874 --> 00:32:20,274
But I made all the trailers.

598
00:32:20,334 --> 00:32:22,636
We did all the stupid ideas like the hotline.

599
00:32:23,216 --> 00:32:23,516
So yeah.

600
00:32:23,736 --> 00:32:23,956
Great.

601
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:24,457
Thank you.

602
00:32:24,797 --> 00:32:25,077
Thank you.

603
00:32:28,959 --> 00:32:29,339
Hello.

604
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:29,679
Hello.

605
00:32:31,228 --> 00:32:35,371
How did you financially stay afloat until the game hit early access?

606
00:32:35,631 --> 00:32:36,131
Noodles.

607
00:32:38,433 --> 00:32:44,317
I made a lot of flash games, as I mentioned, and back then there was this weird business

608
00:32:44,357 --> 00:32:48,699
model where you would make a weird flash game, you would put it on a website, and sponsors

609
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:50,421
would come in and bid on your game.

610
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:54,463
And they basically would throw a bunch of money at you so you could put their logo at

611
00:32:54,483 --> 00:32:55,344
the beginning of the game.

612
00:32:55,784 --> 00:32:59,646
And that's why most players think that Armor Games made so many games.

613
00:33:00,224 --> 00:33:01,665
when realistically they didn't,

614
00:33:01,705 --> 00:33:03,226
they just sponsored those games.

615
00:33:03,866 --> 00:33:07,008
So I got a bunch of Flash games made by me, sponsored,

616
00:33:07,448 --> 00:33:09,209
and that brought me some pocket money

617
00:33:09,309 --> 00:33:11,530
that I invested in future Flash games,

618
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:13,031
and kind of snowballed,

619
00:33:13,931 --> 00:33:15,692
and finally I managed to get enough money

620
00:33:15,732 --> 00:33:18,234
that I could invest in a real .exe game,

621
00:33:18,554 --> 00:33:19,735
and that game was Move or Die.

622
00:33:20,215 --> 00:33:22,716
So it was a very slow and tedious process

623
00:33:22,756 --> 00:33:23,617
that took a lot of time,

624
00:33:23,677 --> 00:33:25,718
and it wasn't something that happened overnight.

625
00:33:26,858 --> 00:33:27,439
Cool, thank you.

626
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:27,979
Thank you.

627
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:29,100
I guess that's it.

628
00:33:30,078 --> 00:33:31,042
Thank you again for coming here.

629
00:33:31,163 --> 00:33:32,186
If you have any other questions,

630
00:33:32,829 --> 00:33:33,973
the guy in the weird yellow jacket.
