00:00:03,646 --> 00:00:09,548
Join me, Cole Hicks, composer and sound designer, and Chris Hunt, the creator of Kenshi, as we

2
00:00:09,588 --> 00:00:15,089
discuss the details of crafting audio for a world that doesn't care if your characters

3
00:00:15,189 --> 00:00:16,170
live or die.

4
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:23,752
Kenshi is a gritty squad-based RPG, but unlike traditional games, and RPGs especially, we

5
00:00:23,792 --> 00:00:29,214
didn't want the music to fulfill the typical role of positively reinforcing player actions.

6
00:00:29,774 --> 00:00:32,435
Rather, Kenshi's oral world feels subdued.

7
00:00:33,015 --> 00:00:38,078
It makes use of silence, and its music almost exists separately from the game.

8
00:00:38,858 --> 00:00:45,242
At GDC17, join us as we discuss the details of not only how we created Kenshi's Oral World,

9
00:00:45,582 --> 00:00:49,784
but how it was implemented in Wwise, and of course, why we made those decisions.

10
00:00:50,404 --> 00:00:51,685
Thanks, and hope to see you there.
