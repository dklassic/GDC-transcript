1
00:00:09,727 --> 00:00:11,648
Okay, I guess, oh, this is really loud.

2
00:00:12,729 --> 00:00:13,770
I guess we can get started.

3
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,572
Thank you all for joining me for, I guess,

4
00:00:16,772 --> 00:00:18,893
the first full talk of GDC.

5
00:00:20,514 --> 00:00:21,935
We have a long week ahead of us,

6
00:00:22,115 --> 00:00:24,257
but I'm glad you guys are here with me instead.

7
00:00:25,497 --> 00:00:29,220
So, this is a live 2D animation demo.

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,741
I think it's kind of self-explanatory.

9
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:35,424
I'm just gonna sit here and animate for you guys.

10
00:00:36,407 --> 00:00:39,491
The point of this is less about the tools,

11
00:00:40,092 --> 00:00:42,996
because my tools actually aren't really ideal for animating,

12
00:00:43,016 --> 00:00:44,238
and I'll go over that really quick.

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,865
But it's more about the thought process behind what I'm doing

14
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:51,729
and how I apply 2D animation to games.

15
00:00:54,104 --> 00:00:57,045
I'm the lead animator on the indie fighting game Skullgirls,

16
00:00:57,185 --> 00:00:58,665
which was released in 2012.

17
00:00:59,965 --> 00:01:03,026
And I think what makes it special is that the whole game

18
00:01:03,387 --> 00:01:07,348
is entirely hand animated frame by frame by myself,

19
00:01:08,348 --> 00:01:11,229
our in-house team of five artists,

20
00:01:12,309 --> 00:01:15,991
and we have a huge, awesome army of contract animators

21
00:01:16,031 --> 00:01:16,971
that also help us out.

22
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:21,092
So today I'm gonna show you what we do in-house.

23
00:01:23,957 --> 00:01:29,724
I'm going to animate a punch that then can go back into the idle, or then can combo into

24
00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:31,687
a kick before returning into the idle.

25
00:01:32,408 --> 00:01:36,272
But I'm going to skip the part where I key it, because it's, I think...

26
00:01:37,052 --> 00:01:39,774
Keys are kind of the easier part.

27
00:01:40,054 --> 00:01:45,238
It's fun to kind of draw cool poses and figure that out.

28
00:01:45,818 --> 00:01:47,700
But I think what makes it hard and what

29
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,042
makes it relevant to game animation

30
00:01:50,202 --> 00:01:52,023
is knowing how to do those in-betweens

31
00:01:52,503 --> 00:01:55,886
and work within the restrictions that your game designer is

32
00:01:55,906 --> 00:01:56,826
going to impose on you.

33
00:01:58,968 --> 00:02:01,570
So before we start animating, I just

34
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,612
want to go over a few quick technical details

35
00:02:04,652 --> 00:02:05,312
about Skullgirls.

36
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:12,413
Skullgirls runs at 60 FPS, but it's kind of ridiculous to animate at 60 FPS.

37
00:02:12,973 --> 00:02:21,217
So our closest approximation is to animate at 30, which turns into holding every drawing for about four frames.

38
00:02:22,417 --> 00:02:29,280
It's kind of like animating at twos at 30, but we also change how long each frame is held depending on what we need.

39
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,921
Like a smear frame might be held for less or a key might be held for longer.

40
00:02:34,444 --> 00:02:36,984
Today, let's say, and you totally didn't,

41
00:02:37,044 --> 00:02:39,345
but let's say my animator, or sorry, my designer

42
00:02:39,825 --> 00:02:44,247
asked me to animate a medium punch and then a hard kick.

43
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:49,849
For us, a medium hits around frame 10 at 60 FPS,

44
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:53,690
and the hard hits around frame 16 at 60.

45
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,351
So in Skullgirls, what that turns into for us

46
00:02:57,591 --> 00:03:00,592
is that the medium move is gonna have something like.

47
00:03:01,245 --> 00:03:05,127
three drawings of startup, one drawing of the active,

48
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:08,329
like attacking key frame, and then three drawings

49
00:03:08,429 --> 00:03:09,609
returning back to the idle.

50
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,952
And then the hard is going to have five drawings startup,

51
00:03:14,552 --> 00:03:18,174
one drawing active, and then five returning to idle.

52
00:03:19,295 --> 00:03:21,376
These are more just kind of rules of thumb.

53
00:03:21,696 --> 00:03:23,737
So we refer to our designer, Mike,

54
00:03:23,757 --> 00:03:26,058
for the specifics of what he wants for each move.

55
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:28,140
But this is kind of how we get started.

56
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,377
So I'm going to take a seat.

57
00:03:43,251 --> 00:03:44,113
Can you guys still hear me?

58
00:03:45,234 --> 00:03:45,654
Okay, cool.

59
00:03:48,658 --> 00:03:49,379
Okay, so.

60
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:55,896
Again, I think you guys can use whatever tool works best.

61
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,420
I'm going to talk about what I use really quick, which

62
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,441
is Photoshop.

63
00:04:01,502 --> 00:04:03,844
I animate entirely in Photoshop.

64
00:04:04,165 --> 00:04:06,527
I have, I can actually get rid of this here.

65
00:04:09,865 --> 00:04:18,428
I set my F keys to switch frames back and forth, Spacebar plays, and it's really, it's

66
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,410
not great for animating, honestly.

67
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,670
But the reason we use it is...

68
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:28,032
Because I'm used to it. That's the main thing.

69
00:04:29,593 --> 00:04:32,914
Skullgirls uses raster images. We export everything as PNGs.

70
00:04:33,515 --> 00:04:37,996
And we also have a few like Photoshop scripts that help us get things into the game.

71
00:04:39,337 --> 00:04:42,298
And also a big thing is that Photoshop is the most

72
00:04:42,718 --> 00:04:46,280
accessible program to all of our contract animators, which is a big deal.

73
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,943
So just, you know, say saying, you know, give us your files back in PSDs is the easiest thing.

74
00:04:55,689 --> 00:04:57,510
So, you know, whatever gets the job done.

75
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,111
Maybe we'll switch someday, but this is what we use for now.

76
00:05:01,971 --> 00:05:03,612
So I guess I can get started.

77
00:05:04,072 --> 00:05:11,155
This character is a little girl I just designed for this talk.

78
00:05:12,316 --> 00:05:14,097
She's probably never going to be anywhere again.

79
00:05:15,257 --> 00:05:18,198
But I have come here with my keys already done.

80
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:21,580
So you can see I have this first move.

81
00:05:23,683 --> 00:05:27,785
where she kind of does this like force palm thing before going back to the idle

82
00:05:28,526 --> 00:05:34,769
and then she can do it before kicking and then returning back to idle.

83
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,431
And she kind of, she's swinging her leg around the back there.

84
00:05:42,572 --> 00:05:46,394
So I guess I can just start drawing.

85
00:05:49,836 --> 00:05:51,216
So one thing I try to do first.

86
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,762
is on impacts, actually pretty much any move,

87
00:06:01,802 --> 00:06:03,263
I try to have a smear.

88
00:06:07,885 --> 00:06:12,908
So here, right before she hits,

89
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:16,390
I want it to overshoot and then smear it

90
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,650
before hitting that final key.

91
00:06:18,271 --> 00:06:20,051
And these are gonna be really scribbly

92
00:06:20,232 --> 00:06:22,193
because I wanna get through as much of it as I can.

93
00:06:22,493 --> 00:06:25,134
So it's not gonna look great, but I'll try my best.

94
00:06:31,972 --> 00:06:40,494
So just for a split second, she'll kind of like overshoot before going into that final key.

95
00:06:48,536 --> 00:06:56,018
And I find what this helps do is really give you the impression of kind of like that snap

96
00:06:56,779 --> 00:07:00,900
before going into the final key.

97
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,311
Let's see.

98
00:07:10,353 --> 00:07:12,574
So even just that, it's really close to the key,

99
00:07:14,155 --> 00:07:16,136
but it just very slightly overshoots.

100
00:07:18,497 --> 00:07:22,678
You can kind of see that it gives it a little bit more of that impression of impact.

101
00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:27,060
And I can add it here as well.

102
00:07:30,637 --> 00:07:35,799
So already, we have two of the three drawings of Startup before going into the key here.

103
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,480
So we can just add one more in between.

104
00:07:51,743 --> 00:07:55,544
She can kind of start to shift her body forward.

105
00:07:59,122 --> 00:08:02,986
Actually, I have her hands smearing just a little bit as she comes out because it has to go fast.

106
00:08:04,347 --> 00:08:07,370
So she can kind of shift her upper body forward a little bit.

107
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,562
And one thing I like to do is to think about...

108
00:08:21,947 --> 00:08:25,189
when you're moving your body, what part is moving first?

109
00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:27,070
Where are you moving your weight first?

110
00:08:27,731 --> 00:08:31,033
So in this punch, I'm thinking,

111
00:08:31,994 --> 00:08:33,735
she kind of throws her chest forward,

112
00:08:33,815 --> 00:08:37,798
but her hand is actually still towards the back.

113
00:08:38,939 --> 00:08:42,221
And that's another thing that can help

114
00:08:44,963 --> 00:08:48,326
kind of give that contrast and give that snap into the move.

115
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:50,788
Add it here.

116
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:57,302
So let's see how this looks.

117
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,041
Yeah, so...

118
00:09:18,728 --> 00:09:25,352
So, it goes fast. My computer doesn't play it very fast, which is actually kind of one of the things that's a pain about Photoshop.

119
00:09:27,714 --> 00:09:34,259
But I think you can see just from that, you can kind of get a sense of just this quick snap and impact.

120
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,900
And it's only three frames.

121
00:09:38,562 --> 00:09:41,043
So really quick, we can just have her go back to the idle.

122
00:09:42,741 --> 00:09:46,463
One thing that I find super helpful for 2D animation,

123
00:09:46,483 --> 00:09:48,283
that maybe you've noticed,

124
00:09:48,343 --> 00:09:51,445
is that I keep my idle frame on the whole time.

125
00:09:52,645 --> 00:09:55,086
And that kind of helps me keep my proportions in check,

126
00:09:55,206 --> 00:09:56,687
because when you're 2D animating,

127
00:09:56,727 --> 00:10:00,248
it's very easy for things to change in size

128
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,109
or go off model.

129
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:08,957
So having my idle frame on all the time, like you don't really notice it, but that is a huge

130
00:10:08,997 --> 00:10:12,521
help for me in trying to keep stuff the right shape and the right size.

131
00:10:19,481 --> 00:10:23,082
So, let's kind of quickly get her back to idle.

132
00:10:24,202 --> 00:10:29,063
I really try to emphasize my keyframes as much as possible,

133
00:10:29,143 --> 00:10:32,144
because when you're moving as fast as you need to for games,

134
00:10:33,184 --> 00:10:38,305
I think you want to make sure everything reads as clear as possible.

135
00:10:41,146 --> 00:10:45,807
So here, she's kind of...

136
00:10:48,084 --> 00:10:50,286
favoring her key. So I basically have

137
00:10:51,368 --> 00:10:52,048
three frames

138
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,273
that are really close to that key.

139
00:11:06,723 --> 00:11:08,425
And I think that helps it read a lot more.

140
00:11:25,908 --> 00:11:29,350
I try not to make the return to idle too complex.

141
00:11:31,071 --> 00:11:36,755
I've seen some animations where they kind of try to put a bit of flourish into the return to idle,

142
00:11:37,355 --> 00:11:43,418
but I think the main point of it is just to get back to your starting point,

143
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:48,381
but also one thing that might be the case in your game that's the case in Skullgirls

144
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,663
is that you can cancel out of a lot of the moves.

145
00:11:55,145 --> 00:11:58,568
after hitting this key, if you press something else, you're going to do a different move.

146
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:04,953
So if you try to do some crazy animation on the return to idle, then it's going to look

147
00:12:04,973 --> 00:12:05,473
kind of funny.

148
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,641
Kind of have her leaning back.

149
00:12:17,022 --> 00:12:19,564
Her front foot there is still kind of in the same place.

150
00:12:27,522 --> 00:12:28,083
in here.

151
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:44,794
I'm just gonna have a blobby smear here for her hand to go back. I'm not worrying too much

152
00:12:45,635 --> 00:12:51,619
about her back arm here because it's actually going to all be hidden by her little cape thing,

153
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:53,920
but I'm still trying to keep it in mind.

154
00:12:56,392 --> 00:12:59,754
And here, she's sliding that book back foot.

155
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:30,768
Okay, so we can kind of check out how that looks.

156
00:13:36,393 --> 00:13:38,735
Zooming out makes it play faster on my computer.

157
00:13:42,978 --> 00:13:47,281
Yeah, so, it's rough, you know, it's very quick,

158
00:13:47,802 --> 00:13:50,484
but I think you can kind of get the impression

159
00:13:51,325 --> 00:13:52,085
of where it's going.

160
00:13:57,297 --> 00:13:59,820
So now we can just start on that second move.

161
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:08,529
So from here, if you keep pressing, I mean I made this up so I don't know,

162
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:12,553
but say you keep pressing and she can do a different move from here.

163
00:14:43,231 --> 00:14:50,933
I have her shifting her hips forward as she's going to do this kick around the back.

164
00:14:53,114 --> 00:14:59,376
One thing, again, I'm going to try to do is to delay the limb that she's going to actually

165
00:14:59,436 --> 00:15:01,576
end up attacking with for as much as possible.

166
00:15:05,457 --> 00:15:08,858
Again, still closer to the key.

167
00:15:35,608 --> 00:15:37,829
So she just moves her butt forward basically.

168
00:15:45,471 --> 00:15:46,152
From here

169
00:15:50,593 --> 00:15:55,395
I'm gonna have her twist her upper body way more than she's twisting

170
00:15:56,895 --> 00:15:58,836
her lower because she's leading

171
00:15:58,956 --> 00:16:01,677
with her upper body before her lower half kinda catches up.

172
00:16:21,057 --> 00:16:29,204
and still having this leg delayed as much as possible.

173
00:16:31,486 --> 00:16:34,329
Even though I think technically her body's kind of breaking here.

174
00:16:38,447 --> 00:16:41,888
when you play the full thing you don't really see it but you feel it.

175
00:16:41,988 --> 00:16:46,929
And I think if you watch a lot of game animations step-by-step,

176
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:49,890
Dead or Alive is actually something that does this a ton.

177
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:54,291
If you go frame-by-frame through any, actually, since the first one

178
00:16:54,531 --> 00:16:58,232
of the Dead or Alive games, they break the bodies like crazy and it looks insane.

179
00:17:00,392 --> 00:17:01,633
But they do a great job at that.

180
00:17:16,904 --> 00:17:29,747
So here, I think her torso is going to almost be where it ends up.

181
00:17:33,888 --> 00:17:37,369
But her lower body...

182
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:45,131
I'm gonna have her foot kind of back here.

183
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:51,323
and smear all the way down so you really get that clear arc.

184
00:18:06,774 --> 00:18:12,078
Yeah, so from here you can kind of get that sense of weight as she's throwing

185
00:18:12,118 --> 00:18:15,140
her leg up super high before hitting that final key.

186
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:25,637
And I think even though they're just scrubbles, you can still get the sense of what's happening.

187
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:36,324
So I want to add one more frame before hitting my key.

188
00:18:47,812 --> 00:18:49,393
And again, I'm going to have this one...

189
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:58,725
pretty much almost be a trace over of my final key.

190
00:19:01,186 --> 00:19:04,969
I'm going to end the smear here.

191
00:19:10,773 --> 00:19:15,917
And this time I'm not doing an overshoot because she's kind of swinging around.

192
00:19:19,745 --> 00:19:21,687
So the motion will continue afterwards.

193
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:26,912
But I'm still trying to keep it pretty close to my key.

194
00:19:49,377 --> 00:19:53,841
Also, if you rotate in Photoshop, using the little anchor point is very useful.

195
00:20:06,513 --> 00:20:08,635
Okay, so let's see how that looks.

196
00:20:40,545 --> 00:20:42,126
Again, zooming out is kind of annoying.

197
00:20:44,947 --> 00:20:51,450
But, yeah, super rough, but you can kind of get the sense of what's happening, and I think

198
00:20:52,231 --> 00:20:55,252
it does an okay job of conveying that kind of weight,

199
00:20:56,993 --> 00:21:00,954
despite, you know, having such a strict limitation put on it.

200
00:21:04,876 --> 00:21:09,738
Some of my arcs are kind of broken, but it's okay this time.

201
00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:20,897
So again, let's just try to get her back to the idol.

202
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:33,195
When I tried animating this before, I kind of had her shift her weight forward before returning back to the idle,

203
00:22:34,456 --> 00:22:37,557
and it kind of made the whole motion muddy.

204
00:22:38,377 --> 00:22:45,820
So I feel like, physically, if she's throwing her leg back, I would want her to move her torso forward,

205
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,901
but it honestly just didn't really look good.

206
00:22:51,242 --> 00:22:54,243
So I ended up just trying to have her...

207
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,124
keep her upper torso pretty much in the same place

208
00:23:04,692 --> 00:23:05,753
for as much as possible

209
00:23:12,302 --> 00:23:13,283
before returning back.

210
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,352
So she's kind of falling back into the idle here

211
00:24:29,292 --> 00:24:32,375
because she has all the weight of her legs swinging around her,

212
00:24:32,455 --> 00:24:34,297
kind of catching up to her.

213
00:24:34,317 --> 00:24:42,024
And one last frame.

214
00:25:13,785 --> 00:25:14,966
Let's see if that works okay.

215
00:25:25,092 --> 00:25:27,673
So, I'd want to kind of work it over a little bit more,

216
00:25:29,134 --> 00:25:30,095
because it's so scribbly.

217
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:39,320
But I think it works okay, and it hits

218
00:25:40,201 --> 00:25:41,841
at all the right times that our designer needs.

219
00:25:46,472 --> 00:25:49,133
And in game, we would actually kind of mess

220
00:25:49,213 --> 00:25:50,854
with how long each frame is held.

221
00:25:50,994 --> 00:25:53,955
So right here, in my timeline,

222
00:25:54,035 --> 00:25:55,516
I have them all evenly spaced.

223
00:25:58,817 --> 00:26:01,738
But realistically, we would be holding,

224
00:26:01,918 --> 00:26:05,139
not this one, holding like this smears

225
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,581
for way less.

226
00:26:11,161 --> 00:26:13,662
That kind of aids in not seeing them.

227
00:26:16,527 --> 00:26:17,747
feeling them a bit more.

228
00:26:23,768 --> 00:26:27,929
I'm not going to worry about it too much this time, but just as a test and

229
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:29,669
seeing if my computer can play it.

230
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:36,571
Yeah, so it's a little bit better.

231
00:26:40,112 --> 00:26:43,152
Okay, so we have the whole thing very, very,

232
00:26:43,653 --> 00:26:44,813
very roughly roughed out.

233
00:26:46,584 --> 00:26:53,149
So one thing I added to this character that I thought would be fun is her big cape thing there.

234
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:59,833
So when you're working with so few frames in 2D animation, I find that using your follow-through

235
00:26:59,873 --> 00:27:07,399
animation is super helpful in kind of bridging the gap between your widely spaced frames.

236
00:27:11,722 --> 00:27:14,964
And it can kind of emphasize a motion that you want to make.

237
00:27:28,682 --> 00:27:30,611
So I'm just going to do kind of the rough shapes here.

238
00:27:57,703 --> 00:28:05,721
the bottom of her cape is kind of staying in the same place as she moves the part that

239
00:28:05,741 --> 00:28:07,786
kind of like has to move with her forward.

240
00:28:26,363 --> 00:28:33,586
And here, despite it being the impact, you can have it still be on its way up.

241
00:28:38,628 --> 00:28:39,949
So it kind of balloons out.

242
00:28:46,012 --> 00:28:46,732
And then here.

243
00:29:06,992 --> 00:29:11,414
Here it's kind of finally up and open.

244
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:24,600
And in-game, we have Hit Stop,

245
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,702
which is basically where, on an impact,

246
00:29:28,102 --> 00:29:30,063
both of the characters will freeze for a second

247
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:31,424
before playing the rest of the animation.

248
00:29:31,464 --> 00:29:32,924
You'll see it a lot in, like, Street Fighter.

249
00:29:34,645 --> 00:29:42,211
So that's one thing you have to keep in mind when you're doing your keys, is that this is going to be held just for a bit longer, and you're going to see it.

250
00:29:42,712 --> 00:29:48,736
So that's where follow-through can get a little tricky, because she's going to stop, and you're going to see it, and that's kind of it.

251
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:55,581
So it's just one thing you have to keep in mind in your animations if you have hitstop in your game.

252
00:30:04,528 --> 00:30:05,088
And here.

253
00:30:13,911 --> 00:30:16,371
Even as she's starting to return to the idol,

254
00:30:19,412 --> 00:30:23,853
I want her cape to still be coming up afterwards.

255
00:30:55,725 --> 00:30:58,406
And here's one thing that gets tricky in games.

256
00:31:00,087 --> 00:31:00,687
follow through

257
00:31:00,707 --> 00:31:07,349
in real life, you know, if you're wearing like a cape or your hair is long, it's going to keep

258
00:31:07,709 --> 00:31:11,490
continuing its motion even after your body has stopped moving.

259
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:17,812
And in games, in 2D animation at least, you know, if you have procedural, it's not an issue, but

260
00:31:18,832 --> 00:31:20,473
when you're hand animating every frame,

261
00:31:21,133 --> 00:31:23,294
everything has to stop at once and

262
00:31:24,114 --> 00:31:25,914
there's not really any way to get around it.

263
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,115
So you kind of have to BS.

264
00:31:31,708 --> 00:31:32,769
the follow through a little bit.

265
00:31:39,674 --> 00:31:42,696
So it's going to come back a little faster than it would normally.

266
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:32,774
Okay, let's see how that looks.

267
00:32:38,517 --> 00:32:40,518
Photoshop's timeline is kind of a pain.

268
00:32:40,818 --> 00:32:44,239
If you put everything in folders, then they'll just disappear out of your other frames.

269
00:32:47,061 --> 00:32:47,301
Okay.

270
00:32:52,063 --> 00:32:52,883
So I think you can see...

271
00:32:52,903 --> 00:32:58,286
it kind of emphasizes the impact a little bit more.

272
00:32:59,656 --> 00:33:06,638
But it also kind of smooths the motion because it has to go so fast and then sometimes your spacing can be kind of big.

273
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:19,602
So really quick, I'm going to go ahead and add her her little side bang things because that's another thing

274
00:33:22,223 --> 00:33:22,903
that helps it out.

275
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:11,912
And right now I'm having her hair kind of mirror.

276
00:34:11,932 --> 00:34:17,637
A thing in animation you generally never want to do is have stuff move at exactly the same

277
00:34:17,697 --> 00:34:17,917
time.

278
00:34:17,957 --> 00:34:22,361
Like if you raise your arms, your arms don't move at exactly the same rate.

279
00:34:23,222 --> 00:34:26,685
But right now I'm just being lazy and I'm having them mirror.

280
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:03,664
Okay, so just a small thing helps fill in the motion a little bit.

281
00:35:06,767 --> 00:35:11,671
And you might not have anything to follow through in your character design, and that's okay.

282
00:35:12,191 --> 00:35:16,134
That's when you can kind of use smears to your benefit.

283
00:35:19,037 --> 00:35:20,438
But if you do, it's super helpful.

284
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:39,890
Oops.

285
00:35:42,871 --> 00:35:44,331
So, from here.

286
00:36:02,257 --> 00:36:05,158
Same thing, as she's starting the second motion.

287
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:13,152
I have her cape still kind of continuing the motion it was making.

288
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:56,332
And here, I'm going to have it kind of fall as she starts twisting.

289
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,903
I think technically the cape is kind of over her arm there.

290
00:37:34,379 --> 00:37:37,061
Still falling, even though, you know, she's still...

291
00:37:37,921 --> 00:37:39,242
She's starting her turn.

292
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:12,448
And here I'm going to have it finally do that big twist with her.

293
00:39:02,274 --> 00:39:03,976
She's almost to where she needs to be.

294
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:07,799
But the cape still is catching up.

295
00:39:34,587 --> 00:39:39,152
And here finally, because this is the frame that's going to be held in game.

296
00:39:42,136 --> 00:39:46,121
I want it up and out. So it kind of looks cool. Since you'll see it.

297
00:40:20,913 --> 00:40:23,916
Okay, starting to return back to idle.

298
00:40:35,507 --> 00:40:39,491
Same thing here. It's still kinda continuing its motion up

299
00:40:39,672 --> 00:40:40,793
even as she starts to go back.

300
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:25,491
How much time do we have left?

301
00:41:25,531 --> 00:41:25,791
10 minutes?

302
00:41:25,811 --> 00:41:26,211
Okay.

303
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:46,414
So again, it's kind of twinning.

304
00:41:49,635 --> 00:41:52,295
But if I flush it out more, I would probably tweak that.

305
00:42:58,035 --> 00:43:00,437
Okay, so it kind of works, I think.

306
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:08,993
So I think that's kind of as far as I can get today, obviously.

307
00:43:09,013 --> 00:43:10,113
There's a lot of work to be done.

308
00:43:10,933 --> 00:43:14,155
But I had finished the animation before.

309
00:43:14,295 --> 00:43:15,695
Not, you know, I tied it down.

310
00:43:15,755 --> 00:43:16,635
It's not completely done.

311
00:43:17,436 --> 00:43:20,297
And I had our designer Mike put it into Skullgirls.

312
00:43:20,997 --> 00:43:22,538
So I have this.

313
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:34,932
So, again, you can kind of see how much faster it is, which is something that we just kind

314
00:43:34,972 --> 00:43:35,772
of have to deal with.

315
00:43:37,432 --> 00:43:39,613
And it's still super scribbly.

316
00:43:40,473 --> 00:43:45,374
You know, if I had the time, I'd rather I spent the time, but I would tie it down a

317
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:48,035
lot more so her face wouldn't go all over the place.

318
00:43:49,035 --> 00:43:53,776
But you can kind of see, you know, how it works out.

319
00:43:55,184 --> 00:43:57,305
And I think that's it.

320
00:43:57,846 --> 00:43:59,027
I guess we have a few minutes for Q&A.

321
00:43:59,087 --> 00:44:01,148
Does anyone have questions?

322
00:44:01,168 --> 00:44:01,529
Sure, right here.

323
00:44:01,549 --> 00:44:02,870
I think it's about frame 4.

324
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:07,513
When she's transferring from her punch to her kick,

325
00:44:07,533 --> 00:44:09,575
is that still kind of out?

326
00:44:09,595 --> 00:44:12,597
It's kind of a contextual frame.

327
00:44:12,617 --> 00:44:18,862
What if she's going from a low kick to a hard kick?

328
00:44:18,882 --> 00:44:19,842
How do you keep that transition?

329
00:44:19,862 --> 00:44:20,863
So if you're canceling...

330
00:44:21,864 --> 00:44:22,064
Sorry?

331
00:44:23,398 --> 00:44:26,140
Oh, okay. I can go back here.

332
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:30,442
So he's asking, on frame 14, was it 14?

333
00:44:32,483 --> 00:44:32,684
Um...

334
00:44:35,725 --> 00:44:38,647
Yeah, so she's going from one move to another.

335
00:44:39,908 --> 00:44:43,530
Yeah, in this case, because these animations are just animated

336
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:46,732
to be linked, there's not that much of an issue.

337
00:44:47,292 --> 00:44:48,993
One thing our designer always likes...

338
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:57,079
is if you do cancel, you do want it closer to the key so it reads still.

339
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:04,023
But in terms of cancelling one animation and just going to a different animation,

340
00:45:04,163 --> 00:45:07,485
it honestly happens so fast that you don't really notice it.

341
00:45:08,146 --> 00:45:11,268
And that's where having really strong and clear keys

342
00:45:11,388 --> 00:45:14,550
and making your animation build around your keys helps,

343
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:18,893
because in the end, what you're going to be reading is just that punch or the kick.

344
00:45:23,734 --> 00:45:24,454
Any other questions?

345
00:45:25,075 --> 00:45:26,035
A moving hold?

346
00:45:26,055 --> 00:45:26,476
What's that?

347
00:45:41,749 --> 00:45:43,210
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, we do that too.

348
00:45:44,911 --> 00:45:47,553
Yeah, if it's something that's held a particularly long time,

349
00:45:47,693 --> 00:45:50,475
or say, on their jump animations,

350
00:45:50,555 --> 00:45:53,558
where they have this, we have a three frame

351
00:45:53,598 --> 00:45:56,340
loop of basically the same frame as she moves up.

352
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:59,783
And then she'll continue her animation

353
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:02,945
as she goes to the apex pose, and then start to descend,

354
00:46:03,005 --> 00:46:04,526
and then they have one pose.

355
00:46:04,566 --> 00:46:06,308
I wish I had the game open or something.

356
00:46:06,888 --> 00:46:13,010
But yeah, they have like one pose that we animate like, you know, their hair moving, just looping.

357
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:17,252
And then we can hold that as we move the character down before she hits the ground.

358
00:46:17,312 --> 00:46:18,412
So yeah, we do that a lot too.

359
00:46:24,706 --> 00:46:26,288
Yeah, it's all hand-drawn.

360
00:46:27,249 --> 00:46:32,916
We have a lighting system that kind of lights the edges of the characters,

361
00:46:33,517 --> 00:46:39,624
and you can see that even though the rough character is just blocked in,

362
00:46:40,004 --> 00:46:44,389
she still has the atmospheric blue that we're painting on all the characters.

363
00:46:45,351 --> 00:46:48,394
But as far as like, just their shadows,

364
00:46:49,095 --> 00:46:51,018
just on her skirt, on her face,

365
00:46:51,698 --> 00:46:53,701
the thing that's casting on Squiggly's hair,

366
00:46:53,721 --> 00:46:56,184
that's all hand animated and drawn in.

367
00:46:57,526 --> 00:46:59,949
I wish we could make a way to have it just procedural,

368
00:46:59,989 --> 00:47:00,890
but we don't know how.

369
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:02,352
Uh-huh?

370
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:14,548
Oh, second one.

371
00:47:15,428 --> 00:47:15,688
OK.

372
00:47:17,149 --> 00:47:19,369
He asked, how long do we hold the hit stops?

373
00:47:19,429 --> 00:47:20,229
Sorry, was that a five?

374
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:21,510
OK.

375
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:24,611
How long do we hold the hit stops?

376
00:47:25,151 --> 00:47:25,571
I don't know.

377
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:29,172
That's up to our designer.

378
00:47:30,552 --> 00:47:34,173
And the second one was, can I make the PSD available online?

379
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:35,753
And sure.

380
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:37,994
Should I put it up on the reanimator site?

381
00:47:39,054 --> 00:47:39,674
Yeah, OK.

382
00:47:40,854 --> 00:47:41,674
OK, I'll do that.

383
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:42,215
It'll be there.

384
00:47:42,946 --> 00:47:44,427
Look at that. Look at what I just did.

385
00:47:47,949 --> 00:47:49,690
Okay. So we have five minutes left.

386
00:47:50,811 --> 00:47:52,952
Uh-huh. Over here.

387
00:47:58,777 --> 00:48:02,060
He asked, how rough is it when we put it in game?

388
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,083
Honestly, we would put this in game right now.

389
00:48:06,684 --> 00:48:09,287
And we try to do it as early as possible.

390
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:15,212
So, like, this still hits at the right time.

391
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:18,075
It hits in generally the right place.

392
00:48:18,735 --> 00:48:18,935
So.

393
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:24,641
I actually don't tie it down this much before putting it in game.

394
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:28,704
We put them in as scribbles and then figure it out, see how it feels,

395
00:48:30,106 --> 00:48:31,647
you know, kind of get it all worked out.

396
00:48:32,848 --> 00:48:35,291
And then our designer gets it back to us and says,

397
00:48:35,351 --> 00:48:37,873
hey, I want this and this changed or maybe this works.

398
00:48:38,453 --> 00:48:41,416
Maybe, you know, we need a frame out, we need another frame here.

399
00:48:42,217 --> 00:48:43,317
Then we tie it down

400
00:48:44,457 --> 00:48:46,978
You know knowing that it'll work in game

401
00:48:48,338 --> 00:48:50,158
But yeah getting it in as early as possible

402
00:48:50,298 --> 00:48:52,959
Even if it looks like crap as long as it works

403
00:48:52,999 --> 00:48:56,619
That's what matters and that's kind of how we get the gameplay feeling as good as it does

404
00:49:12,046 --> 00:49:15,690
Yes, so right now we're working on kind of a more mechanical character

405
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:20,394
So how do we balance the squash and stretch versus being like a robot? Do you mean big band?

406
00:49:22,476 --> 00:49:22,716
Right

407
00:49:24,894 --> 00:49:26,435
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

408
00:49:27,175 --> 00:49:30,977
Um, yeah, so we have this character now that's just a straight-up robot.

409
00:49:31,317 --> 00:49:33,958
Um, and what's actually really interesting about her is that

410
00:49:34,458 --> 00:49:36,539
it's kind of a test to see how much

411
00:49:37,439 --> 00:49:39,940
we can reuse from an existing character.

412
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:43,581
We have a character that's already been done, named Miss Fortune,

413
00:49:44,242 --> 00:49:45,982
and actually is kind of a joke.

414
00:49:46,543 --> 00:49:50,324
Um, we had the idea to do just a robot version of her.

415
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,905
So she has a lot of the same animations.

416
00:49:54,486 --> 00:49:56,327
just from the original character, Miss Fortune,

417
00:49:56,527 --> 00:50:01,190
and we've been just giving them to our cleanup team

418
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:04,232
and saying, hey, change this into the robot version.

419
00:50:04,953 --> 00:50:09,355
Which, if we were probably smarter

420
00:50:09,395 --> 00:50:10,876
about how we did it in the first place,

421
00:50:10,916 --> 00:50:13,078
like if we used Flash or something,

422
00:50:13,098 --> 00:50:14,418
we could just skin it differently.

423
00:50:15,339 --> 00:50:16,280
But that's not the case for us.

424
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,760
We actually have to redraw everything.

425
00:50:18,741 --> 00:50:23,824
So now we're turning this super like squishy organic character into a robot.

426
00:50:24,684 --> 00:50:32,588
And it's been interesting. What we've been doing actually is redrawing frames less

427
00:50:33,949 --> 00:50:37,851
and actually just kind of like moving and transforming parts of her.

428
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:43,015
Which is something kind of like the old sprite Capcom games did like Sentinel

429
00:50:43,955 --> 00:50:48,498
he's just like built in pieces and they move the pieces up and down and that kind of

430
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:52,661
one makes a little faster to do and

431
00:50:53,322 --> 00:50:55,183
Two, you know just makes him look more robotic

432
00:50:55,203 --> 00:50:58,786
So that's kind of what we've been doing as far as the squash and stretch goes

433
00:50:59,066 --> 00:51:02,288
We have honestly just trying we're trying to do a little less

434
00:51:04,689 --> 00:51:10,810
So, it'll be interesting to see if we can convey her being robotic without looking too

435
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:11,250
stiff.

436
00:51:14,311 --> 00:51:14,871
Anything else?

437
00:51:14,891 --> 00:51:16,192
I think we have one over here.

438
00:51:32,721 --> 00:51:36,704
He's asking, like I mentioned, that Photoshop is kind of difficult to use.

439
00:51:37,785 --> 00:51:39,666
Would Flash be a better option?

440
00:51:40,707 --> 00:51:44,930
I think it kind of depends on the look you want.

441
00:51:45,391 --> 00:51:48,533
I think Flash kind of comes with a certain look.

442
00:51:49,214 --> 00:51:50,114
Oh, we're wrapping up.

443
00:51:54,818 --> 00:52:00,022
Yeah, Flash has a certain look to it. I know like Clay Entertainment uses Flash

444
00:52:00,062 --> 00:52:04,946
for their animations and they still achieve this really awesome like fluid

445
00:52:05,607 --> 00:52:10,190
2D style animation but their things are their animations are essentially like

446
00:52:10,251 --> 00:52:13,013
puppet based so they have kind of like different pieces that they're moving and

447
00:52:13,053 --> 00:52:16,335
they draw you know just different angles.

448
00:52:17,136 --> 00:52:19,877
So it kind of depends on what you're doing.

449
00:52:20,957 --> 00:52:23,198
For Skullgirls, we really wanted to emphasize

450
00:52:23,338 --> 00:52:25,259
just everything being hand-drawn.

451
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:29,241
So that's why we use, well,

452
00:52:29,721 --> 00:52:31,201
there's other animation programs too,

453
00:52:31,282 --> 00:52:35,323
like there's Toon Boom, there's TV Paint, I think,

454
00:52:35,463 --> 00:52:37,684
and you still can 2D animate in Flash.

455
00:52:38,824 --> 00:52:40,545
But yeah, just for us, honestly,

456
00:52:40,605 --> 00:52:41,766
because I'm just used to it.

457
00:52:43,046 --> 00:52:45,287
I kind of made it work for me, but.

458
00:52:46,087 --> 00:52:51,331
Yeah, if there's something else that you find works for you and can achieve the look you want, then go for it.

459
00:52:52,832 --> 00:52:58,216
And I think we're good. Thank you all so much. That was really weird.
