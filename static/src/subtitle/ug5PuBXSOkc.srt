1
00:00:07,952 --> 00:00:10,094
Wonderful glad to see everyone here.

2
00:00:10,254 --> 00:00:16,199
I know it's early 930 first session of Tuesday, but we're super super excited to have you here with us.

3
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:30,951
So First of all, we're gonna start our panel and you're gonna have a blast We had a blast preparing it and I'm very sure that you're gonna enjoy it as well remember to silence or at least turn off your phones just so you don't get distracted by it and

4
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:39,696
If you did scan your badge at the entrance, later after the session, and I'm going to remind this at the end as well, you're going to get a evaluation form.

5
00:00:40,176 --> 00:00:44,318
And it means a lot if you could take the time to evaluate this talk and share your thoughts.

6
00:00:44,918 --> 00:00:47,039
And just, yeah, that feedback is always valuable.

7
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:49,440
So just a quick reminder for that.

8
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,261
And with that said, I think we're ready to get started.

9
00:00:53,902 --> 00:00:54,122
Okay.

10
00:00:56,932 --> 00:01:00,033
Officially now, good morning and welcome to our panel.

11
00:01:00,453 --> 00:01:06,054
As you can see, a decade unveiled the Brazilian indie game scene's transformative journey.

12
00:01:06,614 --> 00:01:18,017
I'm Arthur Portazio, and you may be surprised to learn that this sequel is actually, sorry, this talk is actually a sequel to a talk that we gave, Bruno and I, ten years ago here at GDC.

13
00:01:18,937 --> 00:01:21,619
That was actually at the localization summit back in 2014.

14
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,945
And at that talk, we explored the state of the Brazilian game industry as an emerging and budding game development scene.

15
00:01:29,366 --> 00:01:33,609
Today, of course, we're back, 10 years later, to show how things have changed.

16
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:34,410
Why?

17
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,913
Because, just a quick show of hands here, how many Brazilians we have in the house?

18
00:01:38,945 --> 00:01:39,665
Amazing.

19
00:01:39,965 --> 00:01:44,066
Which is also super cool that we have a lot of people who are not necessarily from Brazil.

20
00:01:44,247 --> 00:01:49,928
So our focus here is to talk about developing countries, to talk about Latin America, and to talk about what has changed.

21
00:01:50,288 --> 00:01:51,289
We are at a turning point.

22
00:01:51,429 --> 00:02:00,351
And over the past decade, the Brazilian game development community has grown from around 100 studios to over 1,000 companies, employing about 10,000 individuals.

23
00:02:00,851 --> 00:02:02,952
But it's not just about the numbers.

24
00:02:03,552 --> 00:02:11,325
This reflects a significant cultural and global shift, with 57% of sales now targeting international markets.

25
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:15,312
And behind those numbers and changes, there are people.

26
00:02:15,692 --> 00:02:16,092
Look at us.

27
00:02:16,672 --> 00:02:25,656
People make Brazil a diverse country, and at the same time, play a significant role in the industry by forging different, unconventional paths.

28
00:02:26,136 --> 00:02:31,158
That's why we've assembled an amazing range of speakers with unique and instrumental experiences.

29
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:41,462
From developers to scholars, each will share their stories and lessons learned, highlighting collective and individual actions that have shaped the Brazilian game development scene in recent years.

30
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:51,012
So join us as we explore the transformative journey of the Brazilian indie game scene, reviewing the past, shaping the present, and envisioning the future.

31
00:02:51,513 --> 00:02:56,138
Now, to kick us off and to get us started, let's welcome first speaker, Bruno Campagnolo.

32
00:03:04,157 --> 00:03:04,737
Thank you, Arthur.

33
00:03:05,397 --> 00:03:05,638
Okay.

34
00:03:06,238 --> 00:03:10,900
Hi, I'm Bruno Campagnolo de Paula, and I lead the gaming course at PUC Paraná.

35
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,441
I'm from Curitiba, the land of capybaras.

36
00:03:16,002 --> 00:03:19,123
And I also organize the global game jam Curitiba.

37
00:03:19,663 --> 00:03:28,727
I love to organize jams and play parties, and I think these kind of events are really important for us in Brazil to get better at making games.

38
00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:33,753
They make our community unique and I think others can benefit from that too.

39
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:42,906
And I'm sure of that mainly because of what happened the first professional job I had at the industry, at Continuum Entertainment.

40
00:03:44,593 --> 00:03:50,458
But before explaining this, I want to tell you a little what Global Game Jam Curitiba is.

41
00:03:51,980 --> 00:04:04,671
In the last 15 years, our jam has become one of the world's biggest and most productive game jams, attracting around 500 regular jammers in nearly 100 games each year.

42
00:04:05,652 --> 00:04:10,758
I'm proud that our jam inspired many new developers to start in the industry.

43
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,504
And I began organizing this jam because I was sad.

44
00:04:16,996 --> 00:04:17,756
Really sad.

45
00:04:18,637 --> 00:04:24,579
OK, my mission is to talk a bit about Brazil over the last 10 years, since our last talk, OK?

46
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:29,761
But I also want to tell you a little about my personal journey, my personal journey first.

47
00:04:31,321 --> 00:04:34,563
I've been making games as a hobby since the 90s, OK?

48
00:04:34,883 --> 00:04:40,505
But my professional journey began at Continuum Entertainment, one of Brazil's pioneering international companies.

49
00:04:41,045 --> 00:04:46,227
Sadly, after two years of hard work and a superb game,

50
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:52,831
We had Inferno, a unique health simulator with advanced AI and lots of humor.

51
00:04:53,591 --> 00:05:03,137
The company shut down, because it ran out of money, leaving me sad and deeply disappointed with game development.

52
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:08,901
And I did not want anyone else to face the same kind of disappointment as me.

53
00:05:11,016 --> 00:05:28,736
Large and non-competitive gems like ours inspire and teach how developers enjoy helping each other, and also make it clear in practice that we need more thematic diversity in games, and small games can help us to be better.

54
00:05:29,777 --> 00:05:31,539
But I have to make it clear, very clear.

55
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:38,845
Gems should be used as an opportunity to elevate people, more than creating games.

56
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:44,350
In our gems we place the jammer in the center and he receives full support.

57
00:05:44,991 --> 00:05:52,378
Play parties are more than a celebration of the created games, it is a celebration of the bonds between the people who produced the games.

58
00:05:54,176 --> 00:06:07,440
In these 10 years since our last presentation, I've seen gems like ours establish themselves in Brazil as talent incubators, as part of the Brazilian game development culture, and I am very proud to be part of this context.

59
00:06:08,812 --> 00:06:23,105
So when the continuum broke down, I naturally shifted to a career in academia as a professor at the Games Program at PUC Paraná, one of the top private universities in Brazil.

60
00:06:23,486 --> 00:06:32,074
My goal was to show others how to avoid such disappointments or, at the very least, how to handle these situations better.

61
00:06:32,674 --> 00:06:43,698
Well, but I was still sad, very sad, when I saw my students fail, imagining and even trying to create big, big, large games, but doomed to failure.

62
00:06:44,358 --> 00:06:55,702
Then I direct my work to more experimental, small-like games and games that welcome failure, like Game Jam games, like Game Jam games, like the games we produced during Global Game Jam.

63
00:06:56,582 --> 00:07:13,647
So, ten years ago, when I took over the coordination of our gaming course and brought this jam vibe to our program, always focusing on prototyping, publishing, implementing a constant feedback culture, and preparing the students to make small games before trying a big one.

64
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:32,689
Then we grew from 70 students to almost 300 now, and I feel very gratified when I see a student succeed with a game, but even more so when I see a student fail and continue to be motivated, to stay in the field, keeping creating games.

65
00:07:34,397 --> 00:07:36,717
That was my story.

66
00:07:36,858 --> 00:07:38,358
Okay, I'm very happy now.

67
00:07:38,778 --> 00:07:39,998
Yes, okay.

68
00:07:40,578 --> 00:07:47,800
But I have the mission now to provide an overview of the Brazilian market before my friends here, okay, present their stories.

69
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:54,021
So now I need to draw attention to some numbers, numbers about our market.

70
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:59,582
Firstly, we are an emerging market, probably the 10th largest in the world, probably.

71
00:07:59,942 --> 00:08:03,103
And most of the population place and considers themselves

72
00:08:03,523 --> 00:08:05,144
gamers.

73
00:08:05,565 --> 00:08:14,591
Half people prefer mobile gaming, and games like Genshin Impact, Chinese games like Genshin Impact, are a strong part of the pop culture here.

74
00:08:15,331 --> 00:08:19,074
Unfortunately, we still have some problems, like many countries.

75
00:08:19,554 --> 00:08:26,519
Just to give an idea, a PS5 here in Brazil costs five times the normal price.

76
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,723
Top Apple products are almost impossible to have for most people.

77
00:08:32,183 --> 00:08:33,385
because of taxes.

78
00:08:35,187 --> 00:08:36,929
The language barrier is still there.

79
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:46,002
We speak Portuguese and many Brazilians do not speak English well and it doesn't look like it's getting better in the last ten years.

80
00:08:47,381 --> 00:08:55,905
But even with these issues, our industry grows with a focus on external market and mainly producing entertainment games.

81
00:08:56,366 --> 00:09:07,552
We have grown from 200 to over 1,000 developer groups and from 2,000 people to about 13,000 professionals since our last presentation.

82
00:09:08,672 --> 00:09:16,775
And these groups, as mentioned, in our most recent research on Brazilian industry, are very different, very heterogeneous.

83
00:09:17,195 --> 00:09:33,101
From unicorns like Wildlife, companies focused on earth-sourcing like Cocoo, large companies with international operations like Aquiris, now Epic Games Brazil, from Sandro, medium devs like BitCake, indie devs like Thais from JoyMasher,

84
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:41,470
and even groups of students who grow stronger in gems, like our gem, like Manalith Studios from Dungeon Drafters.

85
00:09:42,947 --> 00:09:49,151
And of course, we have Brazilians in global teams bringing our creativity and adaptability to another level.

86
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:56,075
I'm very proud to have followed, for example, part of the Celeste team since the beginning of their international career.

87
00:09:56,496 --> 00:10:00,318
For me, it's a great emotion to have their presence in our first Gems.

88
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:09,064
By the way, we have here Ana from Árvore, which made a very interesting partnership with Atari in her latest game.

89
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:16,712
And to conclude about our ecosystem, we Brazilians love events and associations.

90
00:10:17,012 --> 00:10:20,113
We love to socialize, and we are good at it.

91
00:10:20,793 --> 00:10:29,576
Some of the world's largest gaming events, such as Big Festival, which is now Gamescom Latin America, and BGS, are huge.

92
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:37,238
And there is a strong role played by the national association, ABRA Games, and our 17 regional associations.

93
00:10:37,878 --> 00:10:46,764
And of course, gems like Game Jam Plus and Women Game Jam and even Global Game Jam Curitiba started in our domestic market.

94
00:10:48,665 --> 00:10:49,306
Ten years ago,

95
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:55,947
this image summarized most of our Brazilian indie production.

96
00:10:56,908 --> 00:11:02,431
Today, it's impossible to represent our production in just one image.

97
00:11:02,751 --> 00:11:16,899
So we'll close my presentation now and reuse here the image from the latest Brazilian bundles, which we have more than 500 games, and call on my friends to continue talking about their personal experience as game developers.

98
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:26,525
Before calling my neighbor, Thais Weiler, she's my neighbor, really, to the stage, I want to remember my main takeaway for you, okay?

99
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:32,408
Creating small games is the key to developing better game creators.

100
00:11:33,349 --> 00:11:34,770
Thank you very much, Thais.

101
00:11:42,215 --> 00:11:43,055
Hello, everyone.

102
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:44,596
Can you hear me okay?

103
00:11:45,257 --> 00:11:45,517
Great.

104
00:11:46,617 --> 00:11:50,880
So I'm Thais, that's a weird name, I know, but that's what I'm called.

105
00:11:52,141 --> 00:12:05,371
I'm in the industry for almost 15 years now, and when I talk about that, that sounds really exciting and really professional, and as if I know exactly what I was doing since the beginning.

106
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:12,337
But the truth is, I started as a creator, a writer, a painter, and

107
00:12:13,017 --> 00:12:13,738
I sucked at it.

108
00:12:14,498 --> 00:12:16,979
And then I tried to work as a stylist.

109
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,422
I was kind of good, but kind of shit also.

110
00:12:21,662 --> 00:12:24,503
And I had to get out of this field.

111
00:12:25,164 --> 00:12:27,085
But yeah, sure, let's do something else.

112
00:12:27,485 --> 00:12:29,686
So I started doing headgear.

113
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:32,848
I'm fascinated for headgear, as you can see, obviously.

114
00:12:33,608 --> 00:12:37,330
And this is a Japanese technique called kanzashi.

115
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,031
I used to make a rice paste to do that.

116
00:12:41,392 --> 00:12:42,332
It also failed.

117
00:12:42,852 --> 00:12:46,513
So that's how I felt at 22 years old.

118
00:12:46,613 --> 00:12:51,374
I felt like that character in Undertale that I think we all can relate a little bit.

119
00:12:52,355 --> 00:13:00,136
Everything I tried was shit and nothing ever ends nowhere until I entered in the game industry.

120
00:13:01,097 --> 00:13:06,058
And for the first time, I really felt like I was part of something.

121
00:13:06,838 --> 00:13:12,344
So, I'm going to continue talking about community as Bruno already started.

122
00:13:12,864 --> 00:13:23,695
But my point of view is that without community, people like me and a lot of the developers Brazil has now, some of our best developers, wouldn't be here.

123
00:13:24,556 --> 00:13:28,780
And I want to give some small tips of what worked for us.

124
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,162
Maybe it worked for you too.

125
00:13:31,203 --> 00:13:35,485
In your own countries on your own situations, maybe not, but let's see.

126
00:13:35,725 --> 00:13:58,660
I will just start then When I first joined the industry, I don't I never even thought it was a possibility something you could do as a professional you see games were made by rich people from other countries like Europe the country Europe or the country USA and I

127
00:13:59,742 --> 00:14:06,544
It's impossible to do in Brazil, of course, but when I started I saw, no, there are a lot of people that already do that here.

128
00:14:07,743 --> 00:14:22,526
It was felt like it was an impossible thing to do and still I was there And when I enter I discovered actually games were made in Brazil since the 80s They're just not very talked about in anywhere else.

129
00:14:22,726 --> 00:14:29,468
That is not the industry So you need to get into it to start hearing about it, which is not very good, right?

130
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:41,984
There were many, many dev groups already and many companies, but mostly there are people trying to create companies and not many people just doing games for the fun of it.

131
00:14:42,024 --> 00:14:47,187
There were people doing that, but there were smaller groups or they weren't very talked about.

132
00:14:48,739 --> 00:14:51,740
And people really didn't talk to each other.

133
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:57,001
There were people that talked to each other, but small groups, not everybody.

134
00:14:57,481 --> 00:15:00,162
And I don't know if you noticed, but Brazil is really big.

135
00:15:00,862 --> 00:15:03,002
It's almost as big as America.

136
00:15:03,782 --> 00:15:07,303
So it is hard for people from all over to talk.

137
00:15:08,403 --> 00:15:15,605
And then happened something very small, very little, I don't know if you guys heard of it, called Indie Game the Movie.

138
00:15:16,145 --> 00:15:16,565
Yeah.

139
00:15:17,824 --> 00:15:20,505
Almost no one knows about that movie, silly.

140
00:15:21,025 --> 00:15:25,706
But anyway, that movie had a great impact on our place, too.

141
00:15:25,927 --> 00:15:35,990
Because even though it was a completely different reality from Brazil, it made indie developers feel empowered for the first time.

142
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,070
They felt like they were seen.

143
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,511
They felt like people cared about their games.

144
00:15:40,591 --> 00:15:43,232
And they started talking to each other.

145
00:15:43,832 --> 00:15:52,939
So that beautiful image Bruno showed us with the main characters of our games in 2013, that's a result of that.

146
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:55,180
People start talking, creating communities.

147
00:15:55,981 --> 00:16:01,325
And the difference in Brazil at the time, filming the game, the movie, Brazil was completely different.

148
00:16:01,365 --> 00:16:05,408
There was no funding from the government.

149
00:16:05,848 --> 00:16:09,951
Everything was done as a hobby, as a side job, as a hustle.

150
00:16:10,452 --> 00:16:11,893
Me, in particular, I had

151
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:15,494
two jobs at the same time just to keep making my games.

152
00:16:17,255 --> 00:16:20,676
It was very, very hard to get dev kits.

153
00:16:21,656 --> 00:16:24,297
It's still hard, but it was almost impossible.

154
00:16:24,357 --> 00:16:27,838
You had to smuggle them, literally, almost as if they were drugs.

155
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:31,000
There weren't many companies present there.

156
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,201
It was very hard to talk with a game publisher, for instance.

157
00:16:34,681 --> 00:16:37,102
There was almost no publisher presence.

158
00:16:38,022 --> 00:16:41,684
So people start talking and creating groups and creating communities.

159
00:16:42,224 --> 00:16:49,008
As Bruno told, I don't know if that's a Brazilian thing, but we just like to be around people.

160
00:16:49,248 --> 00:16:49,908
It's crazy.

161
00:16:50,428 --> 00:16:53,510
So students started creating small groups.

162
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,732
We also had some artists creating some small groups.

163
00:16:59,313 --> 00:17:07,557
What started with small Discord servers for artists now, they are huge and they are creating their homes, their hosting bundles now.

164
00:17:08,117 --> 00:17:18,323
But some junior developers started getting together, and of course the weirdos, that's my part, that's where I come in, and what we started doing.

165
00:17:19,563 --> 00:17:26,587
That's what, in my opinion, is different from most countries, or at least most first-world countries.

166
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,483
we started doing more informal gatherings.

167
00:17:31,983 --> 00:17:35,907
So bars, expositions, small expositions.

168
00:17:36,707 --> 00:17:48,977
I remember a friend of mine made an exposition of Atari cartridges that were labels created by developers of imaginary games and games that they dreamed about making.

169
00:17:49,017 --> 00:17:51,159
And some people even did the game afterwards.

170
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:55,122
Jams, especially global game jam,

171
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:59,084
It was one of the biggest of the world, right?

172
00:17:59,384 --> 00:18:00,005
It's amazing.

173
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,526
Especially hangouts.

174
00:18:02,746 --> 00:18:08,469
A lot of hangouts that generally happen at bars, but sometimes they happen elsewhere.

175
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,612
Online forums start also being a big thing.

176
00:18:12,912 --> 00:18:16,494
We had a small community called Boteco Gamer.

177
00:18:16,654 --> 00:18:18,015
No one knows about that.

178
00:18:19,851 --> 00:18:24,572
But especially, the most important thing was the informal part of it.

179
00:18:25,032 --> 00:18:32,534
Because people started talking and got to know each other, and to understand each other, and making connections.

180
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:40,736
And that was the most important thing, at least at that moment for us, because it made our

181
00:18:41,656 --> 00:18:41,736
our

182
00:19:05,292 --> 00:19:05,933
workshop

183
00:19:22,134 --> 00:19:27,916
that shouldn't happen, and starting doing collabs and other games.

184
00:19:28,036 --> 00:19:37,160
And when people work together in bigger projects, they can make even greater games with more ambitious ideas and more interesting concepts.

185
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:43,562
And also, when we are together, we have bigger bargaining power.

186
00:19:44,088 --> 00:19:53,718
We can even be a bit louder and talk a little bit stronger and higher so people in higher places can hear us.

187
00:19:54,899 --> 00:20:04,008
And also, very important, it's so nice to be part of something, to be part of a community and feel like you belong somewhere.

188
00:20:05,647 --> 00:20:09,869
So, sometimes not everybody plays nice, right?

189
00:20:09,949 --> 00:20:13,711
Because I'm talking about how it's cool to have a community, everybody works together.

190
00:20:14,211 --> 00:20:17,692
Sometimes people don't work together in the community, right?

191
00:20:18,533 --> 00:20:22,735
And that's okay too, because that's what the community is about.

192
00:20:23,535 --> 00:20:34,360
When someone is not working very well with everybody or is not behaving well, as a community, we stand strong to make them change or to make them leave.

193
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:39,999
So how things changed since people started organizing in Brazil.

194
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,222
There is more government funding now, that was something that didn't exist.

195
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:54,248
It's not like a fixed thing, it doesn't happen every year, but it happens, so better than nothing.

196
00:20:55,308 --> 00:20:57,429
We do have some very big companies.

197
00:20:58,409 --> 00:21:03,830
In Brazil, we already had presence of Ubisoft, of EA Games, and they always left.

198
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:13,112
But now we have stronger presence of them, which is very good for, I don't know, all devs that want a little bit of stability.

199
00:21:13,552 --> 00:21:20,234
Before, we didn't have any stability, and people started working in games and they have to leave after a while.

200
00:21:20,574 --> 00:21:24,635
Now we can actually have people that work for 10 years and keep working in it.

201
00:21:26,376 --> 00:21:30,159
People know each other from all over the country, which is amazing.

202
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:37,785
We have even laws being discussed in the Congress about making game developing better and easier for everybody.

203
00:21:39,371 --> 00:21:47,213
We have communities that are organized around state interests of developers of that state and city interest.

204
00:21:47,734 --> 00:21:57,236
And people from all around the world have people that discuss things that are important for genders in the industry, which is amazing.

205
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,677
We finally have people fighting together about things that they believe.

206
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:06,219
There are so many small studios now that it's impossible to count them.

207
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,720
We just know they exist because they are in the discord.

208
00:22:09,847 --> 00:22:10,607
And hello to them.

209
00:22:10,868 --> 00:22:13,349
I can't name you, but you know who you are.

210
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:15,550
And thanks for asking.

211
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:16,671
I'm doing great now.

212
00:22:16,811 --> 00:22:18,492
I don't feel like a failure anymore.

213
00:22:19,893 --> 00:22:21,854
And that's the end of it.

214
00:22:22,154 --> 00:22:26,417
Please remember that we can change ourselves when we work alone.

215
00:22:26,497 --> 00:22:30,919
But if we are together, we can change our whole reality.

216
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,060
Thank you.

217
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,260
That was amazing, Thais.

218
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:43,682
All right, so I'm back.

219
00:22:44,002 --> 00:22:47,323
And I'm back, which means I get to share a little bit about my story as well.

220
00:22:47,964 --> 00:22:54,927
So thrilled to share my journey as not just a creative professional, but also my insights into the Brazilian game industry.

221
00:22:55,527 --> 00:22:56,228
I was born in Rio.

222
00:22:57,028 --> 00:23:05,093
You probably know Rio from the Land of Beaches or maybe the Christ the Redeemer or the Sugarloaf, but I guess that's also why my passion has always been storytelling.

223
00:23:05,413 --> 00:23:12,457
To make sense of the world and life through stories is my drive, and that's what, after quite a long journey, but it led me to become

224
00:23:12,897 --> 00:23:17,138
and Emmy-nominated writer-director with over a decade of experience in digital entertainment.

225
00:23:17,738 --> 00:23:25,641
What I really like is that from games to VR, TV, film, comics, and even telenovelas, I was able to journey through different franchises.

226
00:23:26,021 --> 00:23:37,104
That went all the way from Asimov's Foundation to Disney's Mickey Mouse, Netflix's Cobra Kai, DreamWorks' Trolls, even Destruction All-Stars, and I got the chance to explore a bunch of different narrative formats.

227
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:46,185
Each project I tackle and I work on is an opportunity to craft a modern-day fable with the intention of blending culture and sharing meaningful messages.

228
00:23:46,685 --> 00:23:55,315
But it's been a long road, as I mentioned, to get here, and that's why I want to share how these adventures that I've faced have connected Brazil with the world, plus the lessons along the way.

229
00:23:56,485 --> 00:24:00,487
To talk about my journey, I have to contextualize the market and industry in Brazil.

230
00:24:00,927 --> 00:24:06,310
While the market is massive and consumers play AAA games, the industry isn't on the same scale.

231
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,291
Yes, it has grown.

232
00:24:07,391 --> 00:24:08,791
Obviously, as you've seen, it's amazing.

233
00:24:09,272 --> 00:24:16,555
But it's a little bit different, because this creates a gap for those who aspire to get into game making and make a career out of games.

234
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:23,219
The same games that inspire the medium also can many times feel like a distant dream, especially in developing countries.

235
00:24:24,152 --> 00:24:30,597
And at the same time, which is interesting, you see here the logo for TV Globo, that is the equivalent to Brazil's Hollywood, let's put it this way.

236
00:24:30,737 --> 00:24:42,167
It's the second largest commercial TV network in the world, and it's synonymous with high-profile, large-scale productions that reach millions of viewers, not just in Brazil, but also with that content exported worldwide.

237
00:24:42,707 --> 00:24:48,272
What that means is, within Brazil, working for and with TV Globo is huge.

238
00:24:48,732 --> 00:24:49,793
It's a massive achievement.

239
00:24:50,213 --> 00:24:53,757
And I'm one that I'm very proud of to have worked and worked on different productions in there.

240
00:24:54,298 --> 00:25:02,908
But imagine my surprise when I realized that being a screenwriter at TV Globo didn't mean much to people outside of the country, despite the network's numbers.

241
00:25:03,689 --> 00:25:09,836
It was only usually in conversations when I mentioned, oh, we worked on an Emmy-nominated show, that people would start paying attention.

242
00:25:10,437 --> 00:25:16,843
So this is just a simple example of how navigating from a developing country to the global stage is especially challenging.

243
00:25:17,344 --> 00:25:29,916
The gap between underrepresented talent and global recognition is real, because if you can't acquire industry-valued references nationally, achieving recognition becomes much harder, requiring many years to build trust and develop that career.

244
00:25:30,677 --> 00:25:37,560
Of course, this struggle isn't unique to me or to Brazilians because it's shared by creatives from all over the world from different communities.

245
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:47,664
However, this was what fueled my determination to amplify Latin American stories globally and ensuring that Brazilian voices are heard and acknowledged for their achievements.

246
00:25:49,345 --> 00:25:55,509
That's why my career has been a journey of self-realization, filled with gratitude for the wild opportunities that allow me to connect with diverse fields.

247
00:25:56,129 --> 00:26:03,093
I started actually as a Bachelor of Laws, because again, it's very hard to figure out if you're going to get into game development at an early age.

248
00:26:03,753 --> 00:26:11,738
But being in the academia, I got the chance to explore the intersection of digital media, art, culture, free speech, and intellectual property.

249
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:25,990
This led me to work on unique projects, and many of them international, but for example, Creative Commons, which was super relevant in the realm of copyright and getting people to share knowledge and access to content, but also researching game censorship across the world.

250
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:30,874
We had a series of cases of games that were banned, not just in Brazil, but across the world.

251
00:26:31,334 --> 00:26:38,661
This was also connected to the Supreme Court case in the US, and that was part of my field of my research, understanding games as art and culture as well.

252
00:26:39,381 --> 00:26:49,771
And of course, in a very creative and different way that also led to putting together a performance, as you can see here, where cosplayers were criticizing absurd judicial decisions.

253
00:26:50,491 --> 00:27:04,604
So that's something that we were very proud of to put together in the sense of how can we communicate the value of games as a medium, how we can communicate the relevance of it in Brazil, but through different means and tackling different issues that are of social relevance.

254
00:27:05,385 --> 00:27:12,551
So motivated to bridge the gap between academia and the game development community, I also created Ludobardo, which is what you can see here in the GIF in the middle.

255
00:27:13,032 --> 00:27:22,459
This was a YouTube channel where I presented my academic insights as video essays and explored the rich narratives in games while discussing the cultural and legal aspects surrounding them.

256
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:29,263
Eventually, I also founded the Rio de Janeiro chapter of the International Game Developers Association, and specifically Rio, of course.

257
00:27:29,883 --> 00:27:32,504
And that was done with the intention of helping people connect.

258
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:37,846
It's very much related to what Thais said, to what Bruno said, the idea that we needed people to get together.

259
00:27:37,926 --> 00:27:39,327
People needed to get to know each other.

260
00:27:39,987 --> 00:27:52,894
And it showed me, of course, that even if we had games made in Brazil since the 1980s, aspiring professionals had no clear way of becoming, they had no path to becoming an intern or a junior at a AAA studio.

261
00:27:53,035 --> 00:27:54,055
That wasn't a possibility.

262
00:27:54,676 --> 00:27:58,358
So, of course, many people considered leaving the country to pursue an international career.

263
00:27:59,373 --> 00:28:03,256
Fortunately, and this is super cool, because Thais mentions Indie Game the Movie as well.

264
00:28:03,676 --> 00:28:07,519
So fortunately, Indie Game the Movie, as said, was a huge impact.

265
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:13,223
Specifically in Rio, I got the chance to translate the movie to Brazilian Portuguese.

266
00:28:13,283 --> 00:28:16,886
So we got it subtitled to Brazil, and then I hosted a Brazilian premiere.

267
00:28:17,206 --> 00:28:25,232
It was wonderful in the sense that we had the theater sold out, and everyone was inspired by, of course, this potential new path in career, in the game development career.

268
00:28:25,752 --> 00:28:26,954
But, of course, it wasn't as simple.

269
00:28:26,974 --> 00:28:29,738
The reality in the movie was different than the Brazilian reality.

270
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:40,173
And I felt that as well, because when I decided to transition from academia or from screenwriting, etc., to games, I noticed that there weren't any jobs for a writer or a narrative designer.

271
00:28:41,726 --> 00:28:57,119
So of course, because I was already involved with the building of communities in the games I've seen, and already had the narrative experience from writing for TV and film, I was able to, as soon as I wrapped up my master's degree in design, out of necessity and passion, start my storytelling studio, Fableware.

272
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:23,557
I applied for and was selected by Rio Criativo, this was the creative economy business incubator of Rio, and this marked our beginning as a service provider, since there was no studio that had the budget for an in-house narrative professional, but it opened my eyes to the business model of contractors, consultants, and co-developers, which are crucial in game development, and was also very important specifically in the Brazilian scenario, and still is.

273
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:28,559
Not by chance, one of our narrative consultations evolved to a full co-development partnership.

274
00:29:28,999 --> 00:29:42,403
We joined forces with a local studio in Rio to develop the tactical RPG Sword Legacy Omen, and then taking on the role of the creative director, I was able to pitch the game to Team17, and it became, and we're very proud to say, the first Latin American game as part of their portfolio.

275
00:29:43,443 --> 00:29:55,365
As we won awards and nominations in both Brazil and abroad, we would always proudly announce the game as a Brazilian production, and that even led it to being featured on national TV, which is the image you can see on the left.

276
00:29:56,105 --> 00:30:11,828
It wasn't an easy feat, but the point is, Fableware's journey showed me that the company wasn't just about crafting our original projects, it was also about empowering other creators who face the same struggle, either because we could provide narrative development opportunities, or helping them with showcasing their talent.

277
00:30:12,368 --> 00:30:21,534
In 2018, which is the GIF you can see on the right, I curated and organized a three-day event in one of Rio's most prestigious museums to celebrate Brazilian digital culture.

278
00:30:21,934 --> 00:30:30,040
Digifestival was the name of the event, and it featured over 50 Brazilian games, films, and VR experiences for thousands of people to play, watch, and connect with.

279
00:30:31,532 --> 00:30:33,593
And the journey continued throughout the past decade.

280
00:30:33,733 --> 00:30:35,733
Each year has brought new adventures and achievements.

281
00:30:36,453 --> 00:30:43,836
But my primary focus has been on expanding our business internationally and fostering collaborations to highlight Latin American and Brazilian projects and visions.

282
00:30:44,456 --> 00:30:47,577
In 2019, I relocated from Rio to Vancouver in Canada.

283
00:30:48,217 --> 00:30:49,940
and to expand Fableware's global reach.

284
00:30:50,200 --> 00:31:02,096
It was a tough decision because I didn't want to contribute to the exodus of talent, but then on the other hand there was this unique opportunity to represent, support and spotlight Brazilian voices from that international setting.

285
00:31:03,037 --> 00:31:15,626
This includes, of course, working on diverse projects, as I mentioned before, Destruction All-Stars, which was developed in the UK, and has characters from all over the world, including Brazil and Argentina, but also collaborating with remote-first studios such as Good Dog and Pixano.

286
00:31:16,187 --> 00:31:24,332
Narrative development and cultural authenticity are closely connected with one another, and this is a great example of how we champion our voices and support other developers.

287
00:31:24,753 --> 00:31:30,397
We dive deep into cultural heritage and lore to ensure the narrative is consistent and the representation is accurate.

288
00:31:32,138 --> 00:31:41,682
all the way from a management sim game about a Brazilian jiu-jitsu gym in Rio, to an RPG with ties of Mesoamerican-inspired tales and themes.

289
00:31:42,582 --> 00:31:47,784
All of this points out how valuable, in fact, remote work has been for these cultural collaborations.

290
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:58,348
It helps connect countries, build partnerships, and generate jobs for Latin American talent, be it from Brazil, Mexico, any other country from Latin America, or even Latins in North America.

291
00:31:59,855 --> 00:32:05,139
Looking ahead, the Brazilian game industry finds itself as a pivotal moment of both opportunity and challenge.

292
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:12,746
Over the past decade, it has evolved significantly, with the emergence of larger, successful studios along vibrant indie communities.

293
00:32:13,186 --> 00:32:22,934
Remote work has been a game changer, enabling talented developers from Brazil to contribute to a wider way of projects, from AAA to indies, as employees or co-developers.

294
00:32:23,861 --> 00:32:29,446
I've worked on fostering not just games, as I mentioned, but building communities that facilitate this network of inclusivity.

295
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:37,532
In Vancouver, we've organized panels featuring local developers and pitching competitions, all dedicated to diversity and career development.

296
00:32:38,092 --> 00:32:47,099
I've collaborated with other BIPOC-focused events, including the Brazilian Consulate and the Brazil-Canada Chamber of Commerce, discussing the challenges immigrant entrepreneurs face.

297
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:55,325
Through Fableware, we've helped Brazilian developers connect with the global industry and provided opportunities for them to work on high-profile international projects.

298
00:32:56,105 --> 00:33:02,189
However, of course, we can't ignore the impact of the industry's layoffs, which have affected Brazil and beyond.

299
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:13,957
We've seen closely that stability is not guaranteed, but that's why I also believe these collaborations between talent in developing countries and established industries are vital to generate jobs.

300
00:33:14,477 --> 00:33:28,961
The indie scene, with its capacity for experimentation and community support, provides a strong path for us to build a new standard of sustainable careers, redefine what success means, and shape the future of our medium, not just in Brazil, but across the world.

301
00:33:29,701 --> 00:33:30,361
And that's it for me.

302
00:33:30,841 --> 00:33:31,481
Thank you so much.

303
00:33:32,082 --> 00:33:33,462
Now, let's have Ana.

304
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:42,350
Hi, everyone.

305
00:33:42,971 --> 00:33:45,251
I am the creator of Pixel Ripped.

306
00:33:45,432 --> 00:33:46,452
It's a VR series.

307
00:33:46,852 --> 00:33:48,593
And I also love cosplaying.

308
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:50,374
That's why I'm dressed like this.

309
00:33:50,914 --> 00:33:52,394
I try my best to promote this game.

310
00:33:53,135 --> 00:33:54,915
I'm with Arvory Immersive Experience.

311
00:33:54,955 --> 00:33:55,736
We are in Brazil.

312
00:33:56,456 --> 00:33:58,477
And we focus in VR, AR.

313
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,098
I have been working with XR.

314
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,278
All the R's, right?

315
00:34:01,898 --> 00:34:02,999
We call AR VR.

316
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,379
Nowadays, it's just so many things.

317
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:05,220
But just say XR.

318
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:05,780
It's fine.

319
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,182
I've been working with this for 10 years now.

320
00:34:11,743 --> 00:34:13,324
Actually, more than 10 years.

321
00:34:14,005 --> 00:34:16,387
But how did I get here, right?

322
00:34:16,447 --> 00:34:17,628
Everyone's sharing their stories.

323
00:34:17,668 --> 00:34:18,549
I'm going to share my story.

324
00:34:18,569 --> 00:34:22,993
It also took a long time to find myself.

325
00:34:23,454 --> 00:34:27,337
Like Thais said, I didn't see games as a way of work.

326
00:34:27,617 --> 00:34:28,638
I always loved playing games.

327
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:36,305
But then I got a degree in psychology, and I ended up working at the Justice Council, making divorces and paperwork.

328
00:34:37,286 --> 00:34:38,047
It was weird.

329
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:45,133
People like asking for the divorce and I was typing the documents, listening to Mario tunes and it was just weird.

330
00:34:45,874 --> 00:34:51,679
And at some point, I think in a way to escape from that bureaucracy, I start like making pies and bringing pies for my friends.

331
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:53,121
This is the picture to prove it.

332
00:34:54,782 --> 00:34:55,583
I wish I had the pies.

333
00:34:55,763 --> 00:34:59,865
Actually, I thought I'd bring the pies for you guys to eat, but there was no oven in the hotel.

334
00:35:01,326 --> 00:35:08,451
So I started selling pies, and in a moment, it was like in a couple of months, six months, I ended up selling like 4,000 pies a month.

335
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:09,531
It grew really quick.

336
00:35:10,032 --> 00:35:11,913
And at some point, it was super weird.

337
00:35:11,953 --> 00:35:13,494
People were asking for a divorce paper.

338
00:35:13,534 --> 00:35:14,494
Where is my divorce?

339
00:35:14,855 --> 00:35:15,695
Give me a chicken pie.

340
00:35:15,735 --> 00:35:19,558
And then I ended up, people were like, OK, we need a pie shop.

341
00:35:20,278 --> 00:35:29,740
All right, and I entered this entrepreneur's course where you learn how to, where you're going to be, your business, and I was like, OK, I'm going to open the pie shop.

342
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,700
And in this course, I realized I was in the wrong business.

343
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:37,801
And I found myself, and I'm like, wait a minute, I don't want to be making pies for 10, 15 years.

344
00:35:38,221 --> 00:35:39,201
I love playing games.

345
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:43,042
This is me, actually, in the corner on the left playing Counter-Strike.

346
00:35:43,082 --> 00:35:47,083
I had a female Counter-Strike 1.6 professional team.

347
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,023
This is a long time ago.

348
00:35:48,863 --> 00:35:50,284
And then I took the leap.

349
00:35:50,304 --> 00:35:52,006
I was like, OK, I'm going to change my life.

350
00:35:52,046 --> 00:35:52,967
Everyone thought I was crazy.

351
00:35:53,027 --> 00:35:55,989
My family is just like a big thing going on.

352
00:35:56,109 --> 00:35:58,492
I changed career, but I also changed country.

353
00:35:59,012 --> 00:36:02,095
I always wanted to live in Europe, the country Europe.

354
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:07,357
I decided, OK, I'm going to start games and I'm going to learn this.

355
00:36:07,397 --> 00:36:09,758
I don't know nothing about anything, how to make this.

356
00:36:09,798 --> 00:36:12,159
And then I joined the SAE in London.

357
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:16,080
And it was one year of games programming course, C++, hardcore.

358
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,601
And then I realized, OK, I'm more of a game designer.

359
00:36:18,621 --> 00:36:22,642
Then I managed to enter a master's degree at the NFTS.

360
00:36:22,782 --> 00:36:24,043
It's not NFT.

361
00:36:24,623 --> 00:36:26,664
It's the National Film and Television School.

362
00:36:29,308 --> 00:36:31,390
But nowadays, every time I say it, it's NFTs.

363
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,791
No, it's not NFTs.

364
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:33,551
It's NFTS.

365
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,233
And this is me trying VR for the first time.

366
00:36:37,414 --> 00:36:39,816
This was a two-year degree course.

367
00:36:39,936 --> 00:36:46,860
And in the first year, I had the opportunity to meet a student from the previous year, Albert, that showed me VR.

368
00:36:46,921 --> 00:36:48,442
And this is me using the Oculus DK1.

369
00:36:49,142 --> 00:36:53,443
So I fell in love, and I was like, oh my god, I want to make a game in VR.

370
00:36:53,463 --> 00:36:55,324
And I was really into it.

371
00:36:55,444 --> 00:36:58,465
And then the final year of this course, you could make anything.

372
00:36:58,485 --> 00:36:59,445
It was your final project.

373
00:36:59,465 --> 00:37:00,865
You could make a project the whole year.

374
00:37:01,505 --> 00:37:02,666
So I had this dream.

375
00:37:03,286 --> 00:37:05,167
And I was playing this game on the TV.

376
00:37:05,207 --> 00:37:08,447
And this game was involving from 16-bit, 32.

377
00:37:08,728 --> 00:37:11,348
And it was involving from 2D graphics, 3D graphics.

378
00:37:11,408 --> 00:37:13,209
And the whole living room around me was changing.

379
00:37:13,709 --> 00:37:14,929
And I woke up with that idea.

380
00:37:14,949 --> 00:37:17,070
Oh my god, I want to build a time machine.

381
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:22,371
make people go back in time and play video games the way it used to be, how it was in the 80s and the 90s.

382
00:37:22,411 --> 00:37:26,353
So that's how the inspiration came, and I knew I wanted to make a VR game.

383
00:37:26,753 --> 00:37:33,235
So that's how the creation of Pixel Ripped came, the game I'm still with this game, 10 years now since I created.

384
00:37:33,275 --> 00:37:35,335
This is 2014, the picture on the left.

385
00:37:35,956 --> 00:37:37,456
And then I put this game online.

386
00:37:37,716 --> 00:37:41,757
At the time, there wasn't a store, or a VR store like we have nowadays.

387
00:37:42,538 --> 00:37:43,978
There was an Oculus Open

388
00:37:46,899 --> 00:37:47,739
I forgot the name now.

389
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:50,580
But anyways, there was a website where you could share.

390
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,040
It was from Oculus.

391
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:52,700
You could just share.

392
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,001
Everyone was just sharing their games.

393
00:37:54,621 --> 00:37:56,441
And the new one was selling.

394
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:58,222
And there was a lot of roller coasters.

395
00:37:58,702 --> 00:37:59,862
So I put my game there.

396
00:38:00,042 --> 00:38:03,983
And I was really lucky to put a student game and get some annotation.

397
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:06,844
Because of the roller coasters, I ended up being in the first place.

398
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:09,064
And I got YouTubers, investors looking.

399
00:38:09,124 --> 00:38:11,765
And I was like, oh my god, OK, maybe I have to release this game.

400
00:38:12,325 --> 00:38:13,205
So I finished.

401
00:38:13,705 --> 00:38:16,586
The university ended up in this journey, VR journey.

402
00:38:17,186 --> 00:38:17,567
a lot of

403
00:38:35,943 --> 00:38:36,744
in Silicon Valley.

404
00:38:36,764 --> 00:38:38,425
I lived in San Mateo for like three years.

405
00:38:38,885 --> 00:38:40,466
Got some investment in BoostVC.

406
00:38:41,206 --> 00:38:43,988
And then 2016, my whole money was gone.

407
00:38:44,008 --> 00:38:45,048
It was like really hard.

408
00:38:45,148 --> 00:38:46,149
Friends were helping.

409
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:51,232
And then in 2017, I found Arvory, the company I am with.

410
00:38:51,672 --> 00:38:55,454
And it was like really good to have this long journey and find the perfect partner.

411
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,896
When I joined, Arvory was like eight people in the room.

412
00:38:59,697 --> 00:39:01,918
There's actually some people from Arvory here today.

413
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:03,319
And yeah.

414
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,840
Actually, this picture, the lead artist of Picture of 1995.

415
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,042
And now we're going to be, to the end of the year, 100 people working at Arvory.

416
00:39:12,062 --> 00:39:15,603
This is like the picture from last year's celebration.

417
00:39:16,043 --> 00:39:18,684
So when I joined Arvory, we put one more year.

418
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:21,405
I had already worked for three years on this first episode.

419
00:39:21,565 --> 00:39:22,245
It's a series.

420
00:39:23,085 --> 00:39:26,627
And we put one more year together, working, release Pixel Rift 1989.

421
00:39:27,668 --> 00:39:29,309
And then the work was good.

422
00:39:29,389 --> 00:39:35,253
We keep working and we start from scratch Pixel Rift 1995, released during pandemic.

423
00:39:35,933 --> 00:39:39,655
And last year we released Pixel Rift 1978 with Atari publishing.

424
00:39:41,393 --> 00:39:47,797
It is, today, Arvory is actually the largest XR company in South America.

425
00:39:48,497 --> 00:39:53,500
And we released many other projects, apart from Pixel Ripped Series, which was the first game we released.

426
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,702
We released Yuki, it's a bullet hell in VR.

427
00:39:56,202 --> 00:39:59,884
The Lion, which ended up winning an Emmy Award during pandemic.

428
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:04,867
And we have today like around five projects going on in the house.

429
00:40:04,927 --> 00:40:06,848
Many projects, I cannot say, big projects coming.

430
00:40:07,589 --> 00:40:08,930
And yeah, it's...

431
00:40:10,215 --> 00:40:13,256
Everything going good, we are big in our industry.

432
00:40:13,356 --> 00:40:16,797
But unfortunately, we are more well-known outside Brazil than inside Brazil.

433
00:40:17,198 --> 00:40:17,938
It's just crazy.

434
00:40:18,018 --> 00:40:22,319
But all the games we sell, this is the numbers we got.

435
00:40:22,419 --> 00:40:25,741
Less than 1% is the public of our games from Brazil.

436
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:27,961
Less than 1% buy our games from Brazil.

437
00:40:28,502 --> 00:40:31,343
And 70% is America.

438
00:40:31,483 --> 00:40:35,224
So America today is dominating the market, but it's also 31%

439
00:40:37,965 --> 00:40:41,230
growing fastest, growing industries are also in Asia.

440
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:44,394
So Pacific Asia, it's also growing really quick.

441
00:40:44,474 --> 00:40:48,920
But why Brazil is not on this graph as one of the growing markets?

442
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:52,284
It's small today and it's also not growing as fast as the other ones.

443
00:40:52,705 --> 00:40:53,566
I blame the price.

444
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:57,148
This is actually real prices of the headsets in Brazil.

445
00:40:57,168 --> 00:40:58,548
We don't have officially released.

446
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:04,829
When you're here in America, you enter Best Buy, you can try a headset, put it in your head, and you can buy it on the go and try it.

447
00:41:05,009 --> 00:41:08,610
In Brazil, you have to go online and buy from people that are basically reselling.

448
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:11,891
Like, this is the Quest 3, the major headset today.

449
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,052
In Brazil, it's $958.

450
00:41:14,492 --> 00:41:16,692
All of them, you can see, is like double the price.

451
00:41:17,572 --> 00:41:23,334
Basically, VR is for rich people in Brazil and really enthusiastic people that are selling their souls to have VR.

452
00:41:25,434 --> 00:41:34,996
So, for XR industry to go mainstream, we in the world and everyone in the industry actually become like something common on a daily basis for everyone.

453
00:41:35,377 --> 00:41:39,498
We need VR and XR industry to leave the boundaries of USA and China.

454
00:41:39,578 --> 00:41:41,738
So, yeah, that's my take.

455
00:41:42,438 --> 00:41:45,039
I'm gonna pass the word to Sandra, my friend.

456
00:41:56,069 --> 00:41:56,289
Hello.

457
00:41:56,309 --> 00:41:57,150
Good morning, everyone.

458
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:00,172
I think it's hard to keep up with a story like Anna.

459
00:42:00,312 --> 00:42:05,516
I think Anna is the perfect representation of the passion and talent that Brazil has in our country.

460
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:09,298
And despite every difficulty, we're going to find our way.

461
00:42:09,398 --> 00:42:10,959
So I think congratulations, Anna.

462
00:42:11,019 --> 00:42:12,440
It's great to hear your story again.

463
00:42:14,682 --> 00:42:15,683
Well, good morning.

464
00:42:15,743 --> 00:42:16,923
My name is Sandro Manfredini.

465
00:42:18,067 --> 00:42:19,469
I'm the co-founder of Aquiris.

466
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:23,713
Nowadays, I'm a business development director at Epic.

467
00:42:23,854 --> 00:42:26,477
Epic acquired my studio last year, in May last year.

468
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:35,527
And as of background, I also volunteered at Abra Games for 10 years, from 2011 to 2021.

469
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:41,194
And I was president from 2018 to 2021.

470
00:42:42,676 --> 00:42:48,543
And my whole background, my whole career in games was basically developing my own studio in Brazil.

471
00:42:49,865 --> 00:42:55,532
Before that I was working on advertising agencies and marketing, but also on the business side of it.

472
00:42:56,133 --> 00:43:07,717
So today I'm going to tell a story of Kyrris, very briefly, as another example of what was going on in Brazil and how we got here.

473
00:43:08,597 --> 00:43:13,439
I will divide the story in some milestones to make it shorter, as we have just five minutes to go.

474
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:15,639
So let's jump right in.

475
00:43:16,019 --> 00:43:19,360
In 2007, we started Aquiris.

476
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:24,001
Actually, it was three of my co-founders that started the company before.

477
00:43:24,421 --> 00:43:27,062
I jumped in a little bit after.

478
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:34,224
And so we didn't start the company dreaming about doing any specific kind of game, like a shooting game or racing game, et cetera.

479
00:43:34,724 --> 00:43:43,886
Basically, our business mantra was stay in business first, basically doing a lot of work for hire and everything that was necessary to stay in the business.

480
00:43:44,887 --> 00:43:54,038
Part of that is because all the founders, we came from a very humble background, so economic stability was very important for us, not only for the company.

481
00:43:55,510 --> 00:44:03,997
Moving forward, I think I can say that the first years of the company, the most important power of us was the tech ability.

482
00:44:04,537 --> 00:44:11,502
We were fortunate to start working with Unity since the very beginning of Unity as an engine.

483
00:44:12,163 --> 00:44:16,206
And that gave us a lot of experience while Unity was growing.

484
00:44:19,268 --> 00:44:22,849
And it's licensing business across the world.

485
00:44:23,269 --> 00:44:33,651
And they liked so much what we were doing in the first years that they invited us to do the tech demo for Unity 3.0, which gave us a lot of visibility internationally.

486
00:44:33,851 --> 00:44:35,012
We gave speeches.

487
00:44:35,452 --> 00:44:48,635
We were able to call ourselves as one of the most specialists in Unity and help us to make business and deals here in Europe with Cartoon Network, DreamWorks, and some other publishers.

488
00:44:52,703 --> 00:44:58,757
2014 was one of the most important milestones for us, as we were able to secure one of

489
00:45:00,209 --> 00:45:20,170
venture capital round for the company that allow us to start developing our own IPs and also save us from a big layoff as in the same year, later in the same year, we got a business publishing contract cancelled and so we were able to save the jobs and also start our own IP.

490
00:45:22,702 --> 00:45:23,383
And here it is.

491
00:45:23,683 --> 00:45:27,727
So Horizon Chase, our first game, was launched in August 2015.

492
00:45:28,207 --> 00:45:34,273
Horizon Chase is an arcade race pretty much inspired by Top Gear and Cruising USA kind of games.

493
00:45:35,254 --> 00:45:38,476
And the game was released in August with huge support from Apple.

494
00:45:39,217 --> 00:45:47,846
Actually, the game was the best of the week for one week worldwide, and that gave us a lot of visibility and revenue.

495
00:45:48,286 --> 00:45:53,051
We were able to recoup our investment in the first couple of weeks.

496
00:45:55,090 --> 00:46:05,515
Moving forward and brick after brick, actually the success of Horizon Chase brought us the opportunity to work with Scopely on the mobile, on the Looney Tunes World of Mayhem to mobile.

497
00:46:06,936 --> 00:46:09,957
It was a very big and ambitious project.

498
00:46:10,437 --> 00:46:15,119
We never had 50 people on the same team work together for one title only.

499
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:22,683
So that gave us a lot of new experiences and muscles to keep growing and also being recognized by the industry.

500
00:46:25,003 --> 00:46:26,924
And again, one thing caused the other.

501
00:46:26,964 --> 00:46:39,530
So Apple knew our work on Horizon Chase and some other titles, and they invited us to do a new game that would be part of the Apple Arcade portfolio down the road.

502
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:43,051
So we decided to do Wonder Box and Adventure Maker.

503
00:46:43,572 --> 00:46:48,694
That was our first game when we migrated from Unity to Unreal.

504
00:46:49,234 --> 00:46:52,576
And again, that will play an important role in our future.

505
00:46:54,706 --> 00:46:59,231
Moving forward, also Horizon Chase 2 was a game that we did in partnership with Apple.

506
00:46:59,991 --> 00:47:09,961
Continue and following up on the real development until Epic decided to invest in our studio in 2021.

507
00:47:10,602 --> 00:47:13,545
And last year, they acquired the whole studio.

508
00:47:14,608 --> 00:47:21,053
So here is the part that I want to connect some of my takeaways with Akira's history.

509
00:47:22,013 --> 00:47:25,696
So international relationship is quite difficult for us in Brazil.

510
00:47:26,096 --> 00:47:35,343
We are far from the main markets like here, like the country Europe, or Asia, or Canada, for example.

511
00:47:36,163 --> 00:48:01,543
So I want to give a big shout out to two institutions here, Abra Games that have been mentioned before, but also to Apex, the Brazilian Trade Investment Promotions Agency, that together, for more than 10 years, they created this program called Brazil Games that actually invites investors and publishers to go down to Brazil to visit the studios and to participate on the business rounds at big festival events.

512
00:48:03,123 --> 00:48:12,107
As an example of how important was that for Aquiris, I think the relationship that we built with Apple wouldn't be possible if we didn't have this kind of program.

513
00:48:12,487 --> 00:48:17,969
Because we do have meetings with Apple here at GDC or Gamescom in Europe, et cetera.

514
00:48:18,649 --> 00:48:30,414
But having the chance that a half day coming down to Brazil, visit our studios, have a closer relationship was key to the success of Horizon Chase and some other projects in our history.

515
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:45,360
No funding, I think we have mentioned that here as well, but basically we have immense difficulty to find private funding and also public funding.

516
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:52,962
In this recent study, only 70% of the studios mentioned that they had the opportunity to have a VC round in Brazil.

517
00:48:53,582 --> 00:49:00,043
So basically, again, how important is the Brazil Games program to help us to have access to funding?

518
00:49:02,051 --> 00:49:04,532
Last but not least, world class talents.

519
00:49:04,652 --> 00:49:13,054
I think you guys have seen with the stories that we shared here, but also I think in all disciplines we have the talent in Brazil.

520
00:49:13,434 --> 00:49:17,395
And I think what you guys can expect is more great and great games coming from us.

521
00:49:18,115 --> 00:49:18,975
This is it for my part.

522
00:49:19,115 --> 00:49:19,395
Thank you.

523
00:49:29,058 --> 00:49:29,458
Amazing.

524
00:49:29,518 --> 00:49:30,398
Thank you so much, Sandro.

525
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:36,911
All right, so as you can see, whoops, that went away, now it's back.

526
00:49:37,911 --> 00:49:41,532
I'm back, and I'm back because that means we're very close to our end.

527
00:49:42,032 --> 00:49:47,673
Have you seen, over the past decade, the Brazilian game development community has made tremendous strides forward.

528
00:49:48,333 --> 00:49:58,755
We've witnessed the effectiveness of low-cost internationalization strategies, the transformative impact of community-building initiatives, and the significant role of educational programs and fostering the Seed Grove.

529
00:49:59,659 --> 00:50:07,182
Additionally, of course, there's a rise of outsourcing, co-development studios, Brazilian publishers that have further propelled the industry forward.

530
00:50:08,183 --> 00:50:21,108
Our speakers, as you saw, have shared inspiring stories of not just resilience, but innovation through different forms of success, showcasing the Brazilian game industry as a model of possibility for developers worldwide.

531
00:50:22,133 --> 00:50:32,740
And I think it's super important to emphasize what Sandra just said about also the fact that having this world-class talent access the international stage is a challenge.

532
00:50:33,461 --> 00:50:38,724
And it is a challenge, and at the same time, it's amazing for us to have this opportunity to have this conversation with all of you right here.

533
00:50:39,485 --> 00:50:43,188
But it also shows that it's a step forward, a step in the right direction.

534
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:44,548
So instead of

535
00:51:06,154 --> 00:51:08,536
don't go alone, because you're not.

536
00:51:09,056 --> 00:51:14,601
Take these nuggets of wisdom that we are sharing with you from our experiences.

537
00:51:15,141 --> 00:51:17,383
So coming from Bruno, make small games.

538
00:51:18,644 --> 00:51:21,086
From Thais, together we can change the world.

539
00:51:22,367 --> 00:51:25,910
From myself, don't hesitate to embrace your voice and experiment.

540
00:51:27,386 --> 00:51:31,388
From Ana, XR is here to stay and it's not too late to dive in.

541
00:51:32,148 --> 00:51:36,150
And from Sandro, any industry relationship can be helpful in the future.

542
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:40,191
So as we look to the next decade, keep these lessons in mind.

543
00:51:40,651 --> 00:51:48,955
We learned them in Brazil, but we know that many other regions and communities face similar struggles and can benefit from these insights as well.

544
00:51:49,735 --> 00:51:53,880
Thank you for joining us on this reflective journey and inspiring experience.

545
00:51:54,321 --> 00:51:57,124
We look forward to connecting and building the future with you.

546
00:51:57,945 --> 00:52:04,293
Now, before we move on to questions, though, just a reminder that, again, please fill out your evaluation forms once you get the chance.

547
00:52:04,473 --> 00:52:05,294
It means a lot to us.

548
00:52:06,075 --> 00:52:07,377
And thank you so much.

549
00:52:15,997 --> 00:52:17,739
We're ready for questions if anyone has one.

550
00:52:17,919 --> 00:52:22,444
Just let us know if it's a question for the whole panel or for a specific person.

551
00:52:23,333 --> 00:52:24,954
Yes, I have a question for the whole panel.

552
00:52:26,174 --> 00:52:38,500
As a game development student, I see lots of my friends talking about how difficult it is to enter the game industry there in Brazil, and talking about leaving to other countries to start a career.

553
00:52:38,861 --> 00:52:41,002
And I saw you talking about this too.

554
00:52:41,842 --> 00:52:51,607
Does the companies there in Brazil see this as a problem and are addressing this in some ways, or they don't care, or I don't know?

555
00:52:52,928 --> 00:52:55,290
OK, I'm just going to repeat it so we have it for the recording.

556
00:52:55,630 --> 00:53:06,338
So the question is, with the challenge of getting into the games industry from a student perspective, how do local companies or national companies see that issue of the exodus of talent and what is being done to deal with that?

557
00:53:07,138 --> 00:53:07,518
Wonderful.

558
00:53:08,679 --> 00:53:09,560
Anyone want to take it?

559
00:53:12,492 --> 00:53:12,953
Okay.

560
00:53:13,814 --> 00:53:19,760
I was going to say that the first thing I would do, I would just start doing projects.

561
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:26,026
I think you're having a good portfolio where you have a bunch of stuff that actually done it, that do a lot of game jams.

562
00:53:27,128 --> 00:53:27,828
It's really important.

563
00:53:27,868 --> 00:53:29,850
When we're hiring people, we want to see what they've done.

564
00:53:30,571 --> 00:53:34,693
It's important to have the course, of course, or degrees, but then most importantly, what you've done.

565
00:53:35,014 --> 00:53:41,698
When I finished the university, my best, the best thing I had wasn't my degree, my master's degree in the game industry.

566
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,759
It was the game I created in the demo.

567
00:53:43,799 --> 00:53:47,181
Like, make a demo, make it short, and have, like, a good pitch.

568
00:53:47,281 --> 00:53:54,225
I think if you have stuff you've done and you create it, and it's going to be much, much more important than anything to get a job.

569
00:53:54,425 --> 00:53:56,386
I think you have to show you've done and you have experience.

570
00:53:56,706 --> 00:53:59,288
So do game jams and, yeah, start doing stuff.

571
00:54:00,783 --> 00:54:03,784
Yeah, in addition to that, yes, go to Game Jams.

572
00:54:03,804 --> 00:54:04,744
This is super important.

573
00:54:04,784 --> 00:54:06,664
You've got to obviously develop this report.

574
00:54:06,764 --> 00:54:10,045
But I also think that it taps into a little bit of what I said.

575
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:17,427
Even though, for example, Fableware is based in Canada, we're always looking for opportunities to collaborate with Brazilian studios.

576
00:54:17,947 --> 00:54:20,967
So that means that we're looking into co-development possibilities.

577
00:54:21,507 --> 00:54:23,668
And in many ways, because, again, of remote work,

578
00:54:24,328 --> 00:54:24,408
I'm

579
00:54:44,925 --> 00:54:55,271
And I think that that's one of the ways in which we can still leverage the world-class talent in Brazil without necessarily having a full mass exodus of people.

580
00:54:56,532 --> 00:54:58,393
Thank you and congratulations for the talk.

581
00:54:58,573 --> 00:54:59,174
It was amazing.

582
00:54:59,554 --> 00:55:00,555
Thank you so much.

583
00:55:02,456 --> 00:55:02,716
Hello.

584
00:55:04,905 --> 00:55:06,226
Thank you, guys, so much for the talk.

585
00:55:06,346 --> 00:55:06,806
I loved it.

586
00:55:07,647 --> 00:55:08,788
This question is for Arthur.

587
00:55:09,949 --> 00:55:15,713
So you mentioned the importance of remote work in helping Brazilians kind of connect with studios abroad and create jobs locally.

588
00:55:16,433 --> 00:55:25,200
As someone who's also from a developing country, I noticed that it can be hard to build trust with foreign studios when people from your country haven't worked abroad that much.

589
00:55:26,401 --> 00:55:32,185
So how do Brazilians kind of create that trust in order to solve the chicken and egg problem and get the job in the first place?

590
00:55:32,565 --> 00:55:37,869
Excellent question and as I mentioned with when it comes specifically to my story, it's oh, yeah.

591
00:55:37,889 --> 00:55:38,129
Yeah.

592
00:55:38,149 --> 00:55:43,213
Sorry So just to repeat what you're asking and let me know if I got it, right?

593
00:55:43,954 --> 00:55:49,618
What you're saying is also coming from a developing country How do you build that trust or how do you build that?

594
00:55:49,938 --> 00:55:57,043
Possibility to tap into the international market when you're in a place where you don't have access to already those opportunities Exactly.

595
00:55:57,284 --> 00:55:57,984
Okay, perfect.

596
00:55:58,424 --> 00:56:01,026
Yeah, as you saw, I mean there's a challenge which is

597
00:56:01,927 --> 00:56:05,830
What are the references from specifically the country you're in or the region you're in?

598
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:08,492
As I mentioned, that's why I use TV Globe as an example.

599
00:56:08,933 --> 00:56:13,796
It's massive, it's huge, it has big numbers, but lots of people don't know it, right?

600
00:56:15,337 --> 00:56:30,049
I think that thankfully, though, unlike, for example, TV and film, where there is this very strong regional element of even the live action factor, with games and animation, there is a bigger possibility of exporting that content more easily.

601
00:56:30,629 --> 00:56:44,681
So, connected to what has been said about going to game jams and making games, I think the most important part is there are lots of places, not just game festivals that are in person, but also opportunities online for you to showcase your work.

602
00:56:45,682 --> 00:56:55,330
Not just, and then of course that extends all the way to the discords and servers and communities, of course, and this has been, this is actually good timing, because this has been enhanced

603
00:56:56,250 --> 00:57:02,015
by the necessity of remote work and remote connection that took place because of the pandemic, because of COVID, right?

604
00:57:02,315 --> 00:57:12,524
So it's not that, for example, Faberware, I have been working remotely since 2015, but at the same time, that factor allowed us to start working more easily with people across the globe.

605
00:57:13,024 --> 00:57:19,530
Even based, for example, in Canada, there are lots of connections with Asia, where I've worked with the country of Europe.

606
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:23,853
So it's, there's this connection of how can we tap into

607
00:57:24,814 --> 00:57:27,736
world connections, but from where we are.

608
00:57:27,916 --> 00:57:30,218
The thing is, exposure is a necessity.

609
00:57:31,179 --> 00:57:37,063
And that's why I highly encourage you, depending on the factor, to go to these, even if they're remote events, right?

610
00:57:37,103 --> 00:57:38,024
Connect with people.

611
00:57:38,985 --> 00:57:45,029
There are several events that are even more active now here at GDC that weren't before the pandemic.

612
00:57:45,109 --> 00:57:52,335
So the fact that it is remote, there are events that take place in different time zones for people to be able to make those connections.

613
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:54,373
Sure, thank you so much.

614
00:57:54,614 --> 00:57:55,074
You're welcome.

615
00:57:57,895 --> 00:57:59,116
Hi, this is for everyone.

616
00:57:59,156 --> 00:58:00,196
Great talk.

617
00:58:00,436 --> 00:58:12,042
I was wondering, and I thought the statistics were really interesting, so I was wondering if you see any trends as for types of games or genres that are really booming in Brazil.

618
00:58:12,502 --> 00:58:14,743
I'm thinking stylized art realism.

619
00:58:16,164 --> 00:58:19,766
Anything that you see is growing really rapidly in the next year or two.

620
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:30,297
And for context, I'm thinking from a small indie studio, what might be a great match for a limited marketing budget to go after Brazil?

621
00:58:30,917 --> 00:58:31,117
OK.

622
00:58:31,457 --> 00:58:37,942
So repeating the question, just what are the most relevant genres and trends that we identify in the Brazilian market?

623
00:58:38,482 --> 00:58:44,966
And also from an indie studio that is not based in Brazil, how can you also make that connection with the Brazilian market, right?

624
00:58:45,487 --> 00:58:46,688
The answer is Free Fire.

625
00:58:47,688 --> 00:58:50,151
Free Fire is everywhere.

626
00:58:50,271 --> 00:58:58,618
I know everywhere else is Fortnite and other games, but mobile has a much bigger penetration in Brazil.

627
00:58:58,658 --> 00:59:01,461
Anything you can do mobile, it's going to work much better there.

628
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:13,012
And right now, I can see children that are seven years old playing Free Fire and being very well ranked.

629
00:59:14,573 --> 00:59:15,674
Okay, perfect.

630
00:59:15,994 --> 00:59:17,015
Xiaoma, thank you.

631
00:59:17,275 --> 00:59:17,636
No problem.

632
00:59:17,656 --> 00:59:17,996
Welcome.

633
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:22,740
This question is for everybody, but maybe mostly Thais.

634
00:59:23,621 --> 00:59:28,866
You had talked about how prior to Indie Game the movie coming out, the community was really sort of spread apart and hadn't come together.

635
00:59:28,966 --> 00:59:34,471
Was there anything specific you all did to like find each other or like kind of create the community and bring folks in?

636
00:59:34,951 --> 00:59:36,453
Nothing really specific.

637
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:38,651
Oh, sorry.

638
00:59:38,871 --> 00:59:43,274
So just to confirm, repeating the question, what are the best ways to get the community to connect, right?

639
00:59:43,554 --> 00:59:46,796
As in like before, everyone knowing each other, right?

640
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:47,256
Yeah, 100%.

641
00:59:47,656 --> 00:59:48,337
To find each other.

642
00:59:49,913 --> 00:59:56,235
Not specifically, but at the time Facebook was getting big in Brazil, so most people started connecting in Facebook.

643
00:59:57,576 --> 01:00:00,397
I don't know if you noticed I mentioned a name, Botaco Gamer.

644
01:00:00,877 --> 01:00:06,319
It was a community in Facebook that was very toxic, but everybody was there.

645
01:00:06,759 --> 01:00:18,263
So people started knowing each other, and actually it was bad, but it was good because you could see how people behaved even when they weren't behaving very well.

646
01:00:18,943 --> 01:00:19,503
Right now.

647
01:00:19,723 --> 01:00:35,967
I'm not sure which way is the best but one way I did when I started it I move I move it a lot for jobs and for money and whatever but after the past six years or so I'm Kurichiba and when I Started living there.

648
01:00:36,067 --> 01:00:47,410
I started looking for indie hangouts there and no one had organized one yet So I decided to start organizing one and we started meeting monthly every first

649
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:52,013
for Saturday of the month in a specific place.

650
01:00:52,593 --> 01:00:57,157
And in the beginning, only two or three people appeared, but we kept on.

651
01:00:57,818 --> 01:01:01,841
And after a year, like 10 people always came.

652
01:01:02,382 --> 01:01:05,204
And sometimes five new people appeared.

653
01:01:05,404 --> 01:01:06,885
Sometimes no one appeared.

654
01:01:07,206 --> 01:01:08,366
But that's part of it.

655
01:01:09,507 --> 01:01:10,849
That is my strategy.

656
01:01:11,029 --> 01:01:12,630
I don't know if it's going to work with you.

657
01:01:12,990 --> 01:01:13,691
I like bars.

658
01:01:13,811 --> 01:01:14,552
I like drinking.

659
01:01:15,272 --> 01:01:23,776
and that helps but maybe get together in a board game place or a coffee just to get to know each other.

660
01:01:24,136 --> 01:01:25,817
That makes a lot of difference.

661
01:01:27,057 --> 01:01:28,097
I like bars too, so that works.

662
01:01:28,218 --> 01:01:28,518
Thank you.

663
01:01:30,638 --> 01:01:44,704
Just to give an addition, I think another strategy is thinking game jams not only as game producing events, but as events for making people work together and making relationships.

664
01:01:45,264 --> 01:01:50,286
I think there's another way to make this kind of connection.

665
01:01:51,973 --> 01:01:52,935
without alcohol, yes.

666
01:01:52,955 --> 01:01:56,262
But there is Game Jams with alcohol and pizza, so... Of course.

667
01:01:56,442 --> 01:02:03,396
You just get all together, you can stop at every break in the bar, is where the best ideas come for the Game Jams.

668
01:02:04,261 --> 01:02:12,106
And another addition to that, if you have access to any, this was mentioned before, like either national associations or regional associations, look for those.

669
01:02:12,166 --> 01:02:21,032
That's why at the time I started the IGDA chapter, because it was a name that people could identify and recognize, but it doesn't even have to be an existing association.

670
01:02:21,092 --> 01:02:24,314
You can start, as Taiz mentioned, start a meetup, be consistent.

671
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:30,138
That's super important, because then people will know that this is the spot for other indie devs or other developers to meet.

672
01:02:31,397 --> 01:02:31,517
call.

673
01:02:31,698 --> 01:02:31,958
Thank you.

674
01:02:32,239 --> 01:02:32,660
You're welcome.

675
01:02:33,662 --> 01:02:35,566
Alright, we are unfortunately out of time.

676
01:02:38,481 --> 01:02:40,922
We're unfortunately out of time, so we're going to wrap it up.

677
01:02:41,102 --> 01:02:49,346
But speaking of wrapping it up, we are also going to, if anyone's interested, we can talk more at the wrap-up room here after the session.

678
01:02:49,826 --> 01:02:53,728
And again, just a friendly reminder, please fill out your evaluation sessions.

679
01:02:54,348 --> 01:02:58,971
And a big thank you to Bruno, Thais, Ana, Sandro.

680
01:02:59,211 --> 01:03:02,272
We're very proud to be Brazilians and we're very proud to have shared our stories with you.

681
01:03:02,692 --> 01:03:03,693
Thank you and have a great GDC.
