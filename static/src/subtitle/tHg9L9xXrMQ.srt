1
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:06,721
All right, so we're running a little bit behind.

2
00:00:06,721 --> 00:00:08,322
So let's get this one going.

3
00:00:08,322 --> 00:00:10,524
Don't forget to silence your cell phones

4
00:00:10,524 --> 00:00:12,365
and fill out that cute little questionnaire

5
00:00:12,365 --> 00:00:14,587
when you're all done.

6
00:00:14,587 --> 00:00:16,308
I'm Rob Ruppel, and this talk is going

7
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:18,410
to be on cinematography and concept art

8
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,612
and how they're related to one another.

9
00:00:20,612 --> 00:00:24,795
As an artist, my expertise is in images and design.

10
00:00:24,795 --> 00:00:26,996
So I'm going to focus on their appearance

11
00:00:26,996 --> 00:00:28,938
and why that even matters in video games.

12
00:00:28,938 --> 00:00:30,519
So where do we start?

13
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:33,662
Let's do a quick overview of the history of images.

14
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,884
Cave art.

15
00:00:36,884 --> 00:00:40,048
Renaissance.

16
00:00:40,048 --> 00:00:40,869
French salon, 1800s.

17
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:42,832
Perspectives getting better.

18
00:00:42,832 --> 00:00:43,453
That's good.

19
00:00:43,453 --> 00:00:49,441
Photography, cinematography, giggle, pixel photography.

20
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:53,384
All right, that covers about 40,000 years of image

21
00:00:53,384 --> 00:00:53,924
evolution.

22
00:00:53,924 --> 00:00:58,326
So all art is a translation of what our senses see.

23
00:00:58,326 --> 00:01:02,728
It's a replication of the real world,

24
00:01:02,728 --> 00:01:05,970
and we will never be able to match it

25
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,391
for its fidelity or complexity because

26
00:01:08,391 --> 00:01:10,712
of the vastness of the experience of our own senses

27
00:01:10,712 --> 00:01:11,712
perceiving the world.

28
00:01:11,712 --> 00:01:14,513
That's going to be so much richer than anything we ever

29
00:01:14,513 --> 00:01:15,734
put on a screen or on a frame.

30
00:01:16,768 --> 00:01:21,431
So until we're actually able to record those perceptions from the mind and play them back,

31
00:01:21,431 --> 00:01:25,033
which may be pretty soon, we still have to work within a frame of some kind.

32
00:01:25,033 --> 00:01:29,095
So the mind is constantly selecting and focusing from a sea of information, okay?

33
00:01:29,095 --> 00:01:30,715
This is what makes us different.

34
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:34,757
We have to make those same choices that our mind does when we're crafting an image.

35
00:01:47,093 --> 00:01:53,034
So great artists and photographers all understand this implicit truth and work within the limitations

36
00:01:53,034 --> 00:01:54,314
of their chosen art form.

37
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:57,035
This is an old book on photography from the 1950s.

38
00:01:57,035 --> 00:02:03,196
What makes this book amazing was that the author completely understood the camera sees

39
00:02:03,196 --> 00:02:10,477
the world differently than we do as human beings.

40
00:02:10,477 --> 00:02:15,998
And by understanding that difference, we can make it work to say what we want to say.

41
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,643
Because today, we're still going to make images that go on some kind of screen.

42
00:02:21,643 --> 00:02:25,045
Even though we move through them, and they're built in the third dimension,

43
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:28,248
and they're contained, they're still contained within a frame of some kind.

44
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:32,051
Now, they need to be readable.

45
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:34,873
And that is, they need to be visually understandable.

46
00:02:34,873 --> 00:02:39,676
And this is an example of failing to do that, but they're failing to do it on purpose.

47
00:02:39,676 --> 00:02:42,358
But it illustrates why readability is crucial

48
00:02:42,358 --> 00:02:46,502
to surveying and understanding the setting and the intent behind it.

49
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:54,432
Now, the technical side is getting better and better at reproducing what our eye sees as an HDR photography.

50
00:02:54,432 --> 00:02:58,615
And that begins to mimic the value range that we are able to perceive.

51
00:02:58,615 --> 00:03:03,397
But I don't think the goal has ever been to merely record what we see.

52
00:03:03,397 --> 00:03:07,179
Now this is a snapshot of Yosemite Valley.

53
00:03:07,179 --> 00:03:07,680
And...

54
00:03:09,363 --> 00:03:11,344
This is an image taken by an artist, Ansel Adams

55
00:03:11,344 --> 00:03:12,865
in this case, of that same location.

56
00:03:12,865 --> 00:03:16,327
Now one of these images is dramatic and tells a story

57
00:03:16,327 --> 00:03:17,648
and has a point of view.

58
00:03:17,648 --> 00:03:20,350
And one is merely a record of what it looked like that day.

59
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,471
So let's begin at looking at film

60
00:03:21,471 --> 00:03:27,474
since most realistic games are trying to emulate a film look.

61
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:28,335
What does that mean?

62
00:03:28,335 --> 00:03:31,037
In the beginning, films were not much more than

63
00:03:31,037 --> 00:03:32,958
photographed plays.

64
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:36,240
The camera itself was the viewer in the audience,

65
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,481
fixed distance from the scene.

66
00:03:39,907 --> 00:03:42,649
The subject was usually in the middle of the frame.

67
00:03:42,649 --> 00:03:46,371
And the staging, that is the way the characters

68
00:03:46,371 --> 00:03:50,074
related to one another, was generally pretty flat.

69
00:03:50,074 --> 00:03:53,497
Now as the art form evolved, characters

70
00:03:53,497 --> 00:03:54,958
were staged in depth.

71
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:58,100
We had stronger contrast from background to foreground.

72
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:04,245
Dramatic compositions added a dynamic element to the frame.

73
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:08,088
No longer is everything stuck in the middle, very evenly placed.

74
00:04:10,604 --> 00:04:15,488
Liberties could be taken and then dramatic license used

75
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,070
to tell a more interesting story to the point

76
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,732
where we don't even know what's real anymore.

77
00:04:20,732 --> 00:04:23,715
So when I started putting together this presentation,

78
00:04:23,715 --> 00:04:26,557
I really noticed that film and art inspired each other

79
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:27,878
at the same time.

80
00:04:27,878 --> 00:04:32,121
Illustrators in the 20s and 30s were the stars of their day

81
00:04:32,121 --> 00:04:34,883
in terms of dynamic visual storytellers.

82
00:04:37,096 --> 00:04:39,138
And these ideas and compositions quickly

83
00:04:39,138 --> 00:04:42,521
found their way into the new visual medium film.

84
00:04:42,521 --> 00:04:44,683
The way Dean Cornwell and Howard Pyle

85
00:04:44,683 --> 00:04:46,465
grouped and organized their compositions

86
00:04:46,465 --> 00:04:48,286
can be seen in Ivan the Terrible, which

87
00:04:48,286 --> 00:04:51,109
is Eisenstein's masterpiece of Russian cinema.

88
00:04:51,109 --> 00:04:55,213
The same with Roy Krinkle.

89
00:04:55,213 --> 00:04:57,255
His unique play of shape and value,

90
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,797
particularly in his exotic world illustrations,

91
00:04:59,797 --> 00:05:01,859
seemed to inspire the compositions of Ivan.

92
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:11,171
I can't help but think that Jack Cardiff was paying homage to Vermeer in this shot from Black Narcissus.

93
00:05:11,171 --> 00:05:20,994
Now, the way cameramen photographed the stars paralleled to how the top illustrators painted their subjects.

94
00:05:20,994 --> 00:05:27,156
The modeling of the form, the quality of the light, was due in no small part to the equipment available.

95
00:05:27,156 --> 00:05:32,197
Fresnel units cast a very strong shadow which mimicked the effect of direct sunlight.

96
00:05:35,324 --> 00:05:37,785
It also helped sculpt the form of the actor

97
00:05:37,785 --> 00:05:40,567
to separate him from the background.

98
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:43,048
Early cameramen really understood

99
00:05:43,048 --> 00:05:44,609
how flat the screen was.

100
00:05:44,609 --> 00:05:48,511
And they used every visual trick that they could to add depth,

101
00:05:48,511 --> 00:05:49,932
overlap, contrast, foreground, background, silhouette.

102
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,193
And this thinking carried through

103
00:05:52,193 --> 00:05:53,854
to the early color films, too.

104
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,775
Color film, the early ones, needed a lot of light

105
00:05:55,775 --> 00:05:56,855
to get proper exposure.

106
00:05:56,855 --> 00:05:58,776
So they used the exact same principles

107
00:05:58,776 --> 00:05:59,837
that they were accustomed to.

108
00:05:59,837 --> 00:06:02,578
And the illustration of that period

109
00:06:02,578 --> 00:06:04,760
still echoed the look of films and photography.

110
00:06:05,858 --> 00:06:08,520
until new technology and faster cameras and equipment

111
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,522
came along, which led to a more natural, softer look,

112
00:06:13,522 --> 00:06:16,704
mimicking the way the eye perceives the world.

113
00:06:16,704 --> 00:06:20,886
But the good cinematographer still

114
00:06:20,886 --> 00:06:23,047
knows it's about sculpting the form.

115
00:06:24,225 --> 00:06:26,386
like these examples from The Last Emperor,

116
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,727
shot by Vittorio Storaro.

117
00:06:27,727 --> 00:06:30,710
He still shapes the head with light,

118
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,351
but now he can use a soft light and a hard light source,

119
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,672
and he's got some more variety to it,

120
00:06:34,672 --> 00:06:37,434
and it still has a very naturalistic feel,

121
00:06:37,434 --> 00:06:39,436
but it's still very, very, very deliberate

122
00:06:39,436 --> 00:06:40,797
and very, very designed.

123
00:06:40,797 --> 00:06:41,337
So, more than most films,

124
00:06:41,337 --> 00:06:44,380
the next one inspired a generation of artists

125
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,521
and concept designers to the point

126
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:48,743
where the look established in this film

127
00:06:48,743 --> 00:06:51,805
still find its way into our visual vocabulary today,

128
00:06:51,805 --> 00:06:53,426
even though the film is 30 years old.

129
00:06:54,391 --> 00:06:57,172
I'm talking about Blade Runner.

130
00:06:57,172 --> 00:06:59,232
So before that, science fiction films

131
00:06:59,232 --> 00:07:01,212
were photographed rather conventionally

132
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:05,173
because the art of the time looked a certain way.

133
00:07:05,173 --> 00:07:10,034
These are some paintings by Chesley Bonestell.

134
00:07:10,034 --> 00:07:13,235
He was the leading science fiction artist from the 40s

135
00:07:13,235 --> 00:07:15,196
all the way through the 60s.

136
00:07:15,196 --> 00:07:18,156
His vision of the future shaped the look and feel

137
00:07:18,156 --> 00:07:19,677
of the films of that time.

138
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:23,423
But also the way he lit his world

139
00:07:23,423 --> 00:07:26,165
was very typical to the photographic style of his time.

140
00:07:26,165 --> 00:07:29,708
He was a map painter as well as a futuristic illustrator.

141
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:38,876
Even the amazing 2001 was pretty reserved in its use of light.

142
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:43,681
Now, one could argue, though, that this film won't date

143
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:45,302
as quickly either, though.

144
00:07:47,185 --> 00:07:49,406
And as groundbreaking as Star Wars was,

145
00:07:49,406 --> 00:07:52,267
it still paid a huge homage to 2001

146
00:07:52,267 --> 00:07:55,708
in terms of the look of the film and the effects.

147
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,889
Now, Blade Runner began with a unique director

148
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:01,870
and some great pre-production art by Sid Mead.

149
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:07,452
But it was the way the effects were photographed.

150
00:08:07,452 --> 00:08:09,233
That approach is what began to set it apart.

151
00:08:10,712 --> 00:08:12,794
So Dave Dreyer, the effects supervisor,

152
00:08:12,794 --> 00:08:16,236
was watching how Ridley Scott was lighting his sets.

153
00:08:16,236 --> 00:08:19,099
The director would layer in all his elements for the depth,

154
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:21,180
and he would strongly, strongly backlight it.

155
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:26,284
And then to match that technique for the effects,

156
00:08:26,284 --> 00:08:29,266
they lit their miniatures the exact same way

157
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:33,309
so that the effects in the film would be consistent,

158
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:36,812
which of course led the way to a new and very unique look

159
00:08:36,812 --> 00:08:37,933
to science fiction.

160
00:08:44,132 --> 00:08:45,493
Here's a few of the effect shots.

161
00:08:45,493 --> 00:08:48,394
And here's a few random contemporary concept

162
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:49,035
illustrations.

163
00:08:49,035 --> 00:08:51,776
And so hopefully you can see the similarities, the use of

164
00:08:51,776 --> 00:08:57,178
atmosphere, the strong silhouettes, that have all

165
00:08:57,178 --> 00:09:01,620
become part of our vocabulary from this one film.

166
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:11,825
Concept art has become very photographic in its style now.

167
00:09:13,822 --> 00:09:17,304
So let's look at some great examples of some classically

168
00:09:17,304 --> 00:09:17,925
photographed films.

169
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:21,187
But first, I want to start with this quote from Roger Deakins,

170
00:09:21,187 --> 00:09:24,349
which really sums up what's important about image making.

171
00:09:24,349 --> 00:09:25,450
It is not the equipment.

172
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:29,013
It's what you're doing with the image and why.

173
00:09:29,013 --> 00:09:31,194
It's their context, so to speak.

174
00:09:31,194 --> 00:09:34,977
And here he's basically talking about, yeah, sure,

175
00:09:34,977 --> 00:09:38,399
Citizen Kane, the film grain was all over the place.

176
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,700
Their lenses weren't as good.

177
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,922
But is it a great piece of cinematography?

178
00:09:41,922 --> 00:09:43,003
Absolutely, it is.

179
00:09:44,812 --> 00:09:49,334
And another quote by someone who knows his craft well.

180
00:09:49,334 --> 00:09:52,595
And that's important.

181
00:09:52,595 --> 00:09:53,756
That idea is so important.

182
00:09:53,756 --> 00:09:56,197
Every good photographer alters reality.

183
00:09:56,197 --> 00:09:58,958
They shape the light.

184
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,740
No professional just wanders out there and snaps away.

185
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:08,182
So why are we trying to dogmatically recreate

186
00:10:08,182 --> 00:10:10,703
natural light when the professionals completely

187
00:10:10,703 --> 00:10:13,904
shape and design it to suit their needs and their vision,

188
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:16,665
even though the final effect may be completely

189
00:10:16,665 --> 00:10:17,406
natural looking?

190
00:10:17,406 --> 00:10:21,988
Even on a set lit mostly by practicals,

191
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:25,129
there's still directed light sources to shape the actors

192
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:29,090
and to alter their values for a better read.

193
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,411
We'll start with Black Narcissus, which

194
00:10:30,411 --> 00:10:31,752
was photographed by Jack Cardiff.

195
00:10:32,855 --> 00:10:35,076
He definitely uses the direction of light and framing

196
00:10:35,076 --> 00:10:37,638
to lead the eye into the picture.

197
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:41,520
His staging is always the very easiest to read,

198
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,462
dark against light or light against dark.

199
00:10:44,462 --> 00:10:48,965
And I can guarantee you he kept that corner dark in order

200
00:10:48,965 --> 00:10:49,666
to get the nuns to read better.

201
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:52,948
And look how high key this is.

202
00:10:52,948 --> 00:10:54,009
It's for a reason.

203
00:10:54,009 --> 00:10:56,490
High key is light, airy, angelic.

204
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,645
And the angle of light again leads the eye.

205
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:03,786
Seems like a really simple concept,

206
00:11:03,786 --> 00:11:06,628
but it takes a very skilled hand to know what to emphasize

207
00:11:06,628 --> 00:11:07,428
and how best to do it.

208
00:11:07,428 --> 00:11:11,070
Notice the light on the door where the little boy enters.

209
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,491
There's a series of contracting rectangles

210
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:15,652
that surround the boy,

211
00:11:15,652 --> 00:11:18,673
that compositionally forces our eye

212
00:11:18,673 --> 00:11:20,334
to look where they want us to look.

213
00:11:20,334 --> 00:11:21,274
And this is a great example too

214
00:11:21,274 --> 00:11:25,756
of how a nun can be made to look sinister.

215
00:11:25,756 --> 00:11:27,637
The underlining.

216
00:11:28,492 --> 00:11:31,273
the lower key compared to the beginning of the film,

217
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,594
illustrates what's happened with the character.

218
00:11:33,594 --> 00:11:37,575
She's gone through a big emotional change.

219
00:11:37,575 --> 00:11:40,357
Same costume, same actress, different lighting though.

220
00:11:40,357 --> 00:11:43,158
Totally drastically changes how we are now perceiving her.

221
00:11:45,265 --> 00:11:48,028
Third Man, one of my favorites, shot by Robert Krasker.

222
00:11:48,028 --> 00:11:50,530
Most of the compositions were known as Dutch tilt,

223
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:53,913
which means off horizon, which in this film

224
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:56,915
leads to the sense of unease that the character has

225
00:11:56,915 --> 00:11:58,397
throughout his stay in Vienna.

226
00:11:58,397 --> 00:12:00,078
He's trying to piece together a mystery,

227
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:02,140
and he isn't sure what is true and what is not.

228
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,723
Of course, the classic three-point lighting formula,

229
00:12:05,723 --> 00:12:07,684
meaning key, fill, and rim.

230
00:12:07,684 --> 00:12:10,467
This formula, particularly in the rim of the hair,

231
00:12:10,467 --> 00:12:13,069
really helped etch out the character from the background.

232
00:12:15,185 --> 00:12:16,346
And why is that important?

233
00:12:16,346 --> 00:12:17,728
Because the early cameraman understood

234
00:12:17,728 --> 00:12:19,029
that the screen was flat.

235
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,573
And they needed to do everything they can

236
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:22,754
to add dimension to it.

237
00:12:22,754 --> 00:12:26,259
Especially in black and white, because you have one less tool

238
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:26,819
to deal with.

239
00:12:26,819 --> 00:12:29,342
One less tool to work with, rather.

240
00:12:29,342 --> 00:12:31,645
Very, very bold use of shape and silhouette throughout the film.

241
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:39,641
Amazing depth as well, which we'll get into right now when we talk about Orson Welles.

242
00:12:39,641 --> 00:12:44,623
In Touch of Evil, Welles and Russell Metty composed nearly every shot in depth,

243
00:12:44,623 --> 00:12:47,784
meaning a large distance from the front to the back.

244
00:12:47,784 --> 00:12:51,885
Welles seems to have always favored a very wide-angle lens,

245
00:12:51,885 --> 00:12:54,126
and most of his films have this very deep focus look.

246
00:12:55,654 --> 00:12:59,117
Here's a great example of keeping the frame active,

247
00:12:59,117 --> 00:13:00,177
even in a static shot.

248
00:13:00,177 --> 00:13:05,441
The cinematographer has set up a dynamic triangle

249
00:13:05,441 --> 00:13:11,866
to keep the eye moving throughout the frame.

250
00:13:11,866 --> 00:13:13,528
Dark foreground, light midground,

251
00:13:13,528 --> 00:13:15,649
and a lighter background behind the door

252
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:16,970
gives this shot its dimension.

253
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,292
And that's all designed.

254
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:21,674
Another nice triangle of faces.

255
00:13:21,674 --> 00:13:23,415
Once you get used to this motif, you see it

256
00:13:23,415 --> 00:13:24,596
used everywhere in the film.

257
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,910
And I love how dark the characters are to the right

258
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,892
and how well grouped they are.

259
00:13:31,892 --> 00:13:34,713
This makes a great shape and a great composition.

260
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:36,754
You can see how interesting it is in the abstract form.

261
00:13:36,754 --> 00:13:38,655
Here's a great shot.

262
00:13:38,655 --> 00:13:41,317
Light background, dark foreground, which is an X and O.

263
00:13:41,317 --> 00:13:42,917
I mean, how many cinematographers

264
00:13:42,917 --> 00:13:44,938
would have thought they needed the main character

265
00:13:44,938 --> 00:13:46,219
to be lit a lot more than that?

266
00:13:50,217 --> 00:13:51,938
Gordon Willis, another master.

267
00:13:51,938 --> 00:13:54,499
His lens choice, his light setups, his simplicity,

268
00:13:54,499 --> 00:13:57,161
and sophistication are pretty much unequaled.

269
00:13:57,161 --> 00:13:58,702
These are from The Godfather 2.

270
00:13:58,702 --> 00:14:02,003
And while they seem naturalistic enough,

271
00:14:02,003 --> 00:14:04,765
almost like they just sat down and started filming,

272
00:14:04,765 --> 00:14:06,806
it's actually very, very well orchestrated.

273
00:14:06,806 --> 00:14:09,527
All the characters have really good form.

274
00:14:09,527 --> 00:14:12,849
They all stand out from the backgrounds.

275
00:14:12,849 --> 00:14:15,730
There's always a good ratio of dark to light within the frame.

276
00:14:16,998 --> 00:14:20,780
Now this is the rig that Willis developed to light Brando and the sets,

277
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,801
which everyone imitated after The Godfather came out.

278
00:14:23,801 --> 00:14:27,743
They called it a coffin or a chicken coop, and it's that thing on the top of the frame.

279
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:31,825
It gives a soft, even, overhead light to the actor Brando,

280
00:14:31,825 --> 00:14:35,307
who wanted the freedom to move around the set.

281
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,908
So it was done for a practical reason,

282
00:14:37,908 --> 00:14:40,069
but in the hands of a master like Gordon Willis,

283
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:41,670
it becomes art.

284
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:46,077
And even though this lighting feels natural,

285
00:14:46,077 --> 00:14:49,278
it's completely balanced and completely deliberate.

286
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:51,959
He also uses framing elements to trap and isolate

287
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,359
and silhouette Michael.

288
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:56,720
And in this shot, it's all about the intensity in Pacino's eyes.

289
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,881
That couch leads directly to them,

290
00:14:59,881 --> 00:15:01,882
and nothing distracts on the wall.

291
00:15:01,882 --> 00:15:05,243
A lesser artist wouldn't have been

292
00:15:05,243 --> 00:15:08,244
aware of subtracting things in order

293
00:15:08,244 --> 00:15:09,465
to emphasize something else.

294
00:15:11,832 --> 00:15:14,474
And Stora, one of the greatest living cinematographers,

295
00:15:14,474 --> 00:15:16,856
all these other guys can sort of be analyzed,

296
00:15:16,856 --> 00:15:19,157
but this guy to me, just completely artful.

297
00:15:19,157 --> 00:15:21,078
Simple, striking, powerful images.

298
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:24,961
You can analyze and say, well, it's naturalistic lighting,

299
00:15:24,961 --> 00:15:27,223
it's shallow depth of field, it's harmonious color,

300
00:15:27,223 --> 00:15:29,744
but it's his level of artistry, the gestalt,

301
00:15:29,744 --> 00:15:33,787
and that means the sum is greater than the parts,

302
00:15:33,787 --> 00:15:36,449
that for me makes his work so, so amazingly artful.

303
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,010
Every frame was a masterpiece because of its simplicity,

304
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,271
its design, balance, and the choices he makes.

305
00:15:42,271 --> 00:15:45,692
Conrad Hall won Oscars for American Beauty

306
00:15:45,692 --> 00:15:46,412
and Road to Production.

307
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:49,453
In this shot, look how he isolates Kevin Spacey

308
00:15:49,453 --> 00:15:50,673
on purpose in the frame.

309
00:15:50,673 --> 00:15:55,954
Kevin's afloat, lost in this bleak, gray reality.

310
00:15:55,954 --> 00:15:59,135
The static composition of his dinner

311
00:15:59,135 --> 00:16:01,596
to accentuate the static false nature

312
00:16:01,596 --> 00:16:03,436
of the ceremony of dinner.

313
00:16:03,436 --> 00:16:07,057
The marriage, his life are stuck and stagnant.

314
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,954
Now later, notice the harsh yellow light

315
00:16:10,954 --> 00:16:15,176
in those prison-like bars that make the interior so alien

316
00:16:15,176 --> 00:16:19,639
compared to Lester's change in attitude towards life.

317
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:22,941
The striking angle of light, too, points directly at them.

318
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:26,063
In this scene, he's caught off guard by the girl,

319
00:16:26,063 --> 00:16:29,164
so Conrad traps him visually with framing devices.

320
00:16:29,164 --> 00:16:33,327
This is another great scene.

321
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,523
put a lot more color into it. There's a lot more bright natural light

322
00:16:38,523 --> 00:16:42,946
because Lester has changed his outlook on life

323
00:16:42,946 --> 00:16:46,468
and this contrast to his grown-up world and his grown-up job

324
00:16:46,468 --> 00:16:48,630
this one's more bright, more fun, more happy.

325
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:53,813
Very small spot on the face while the rest of the body goes completely black

326
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:55,935
strongly silhouetted against the wall.

327
00:16:55,935 --> 00:17:01,999
Road to Perdition. Last film and he won the Oscar for it posthumously.

328
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:03,660
So this is really brave.

329
00:17:04,777 --> 00:17:06,858
to put the lighter values near the bottom,

330
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:10,382
it forces us to squint more and pay attention to the face.

331
00:17:10,382 --> 00:17:11,803
He did this in a lot of other films, too,

332
00:17:11,803 --> 00:17:13,264
like Searching for Bobby Fisher.

333
00:17:13,264 --> 00:17:15,046
He knows, as human beings, we're always

334
00:17:15,046 --> 00:17:16,968
going to seek out the face.

335
00:17:16,968 --> 00:17:19,730
And by placing it in an area of lesser contrast,

336
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,331
it forces our involvement.

337
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,714
Great shot of Daniel Craig.

338
00:17:23,714 --> 00:17:26,516
Even the composition is stretched out horizontally

339
00:17:26,516 --> 00:17:27,377
like he is.

340
00:17:27,377 --> 00:17:31,741
Long lens, fog, rain, beautiful silhouettes.

341
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:37,644
So simple, but deliberate and designed, not accidental.

342
00:17:37,644 --> 00:17:40,346
The window lighting hitting the cabinets

343
00:17:40,346 --> 00:17:42,688
leads us to look directly at Tom Hanks.

344
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:44,629
Daniel Craig, isolated in the frame

345
00:17:44,629 --> 00:17:47,051
for going against his father's wishes.

346
00:17:47,051 --> 00:17:49,673
He's completely in trouble, and his father looms menacingly

347
00:17:49,673 --> 00:17:52,395
in the foreground, all told with visuals.

348
00:17:52,395 --> 00:17:54,637
Another great long shot of old Chicago.

349
00:17:54,637 --> 00:17:56,438
It was probably shot this way to lessen

350
00:17:56,438 --> 00:17:59,120
the amount of modern buildings around them,

351
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,022
but still incredibly effective.

352
00:18:01,022 --> 00:18:02,383
What can you say?

353
00:18:02,383 --> 00:18:02,503
Art.

354
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,525
Great shot of Stanley Tucci.

355
00:18:05,525 --> 00:18:08,713
Now look how clearly he reads against that background.

356
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,097
In an amateur's hand, the background

357
00:18:10,097 --> 00:18:11,400
would be cluttered and distracting.

358
00:18:12,913 --> 00:18:15,535
Now in this shot, it does have a noisier background,

359
00:18:15,535 --> 00:18:17,396
but it's all designed for a purpose.

360
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:20,797
The main character, framed against a red covered light,

361
00:18:20,797 --> 00:18:23,899
most of the space taken up with his black and white

362
00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:27,280
photographs in one image, the character and what he does

363
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,401
is introduced.

364
00:18:28,401 --> 00:18:30,442
He's a crime scene photographer, and everything

365
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:34,964
draws us into what he's writing like a giant spiral.

366
00:18:40,306 --> 00:18:42,888
Who thought Jude Law could be menacing?

367
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:45,130
Beautiful, beautiful pools of light.

368
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,372
Tom Hanks in the midground standing out,

369
00:18:47,372 --> 00:18:50,715
but not competing with the dialogue in the foreground.

370
00:18:50,715 --> 00:18:54,618
He's there, a presence, menacing, but in the distance.

371
00:18:54,618 --> 00:18:56,560
These are not technical ideas.

372
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,661
These are storytelling, artful ideas.

373
00:18:58,661 --> 00:19:01,684
Pools of light for Tom and his son.

374
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,943
And in this scene, so Paul Newman sits down.

375
00:19:06,943 --> 00:19:09,165
Tom Hanks' head is down, so he blends in with the background.

376
00:19:09,165 --> 00:19:13,348
But when we change focus, once he comes up and starts talking,

377
00:19:13,348 --> 00:19:15,430
and Newman starts looking around surprised

378
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:18,052
but not wanting to show it, because he's

379
00:19:18,052 --> 00:19:19,113
waiting for him in a church.

380
00:19:19,113 --> 00:19:19,834
Sorry, there's spoilers.

381
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:22,676
Great shot, great shot, great sequence.

382
00:19:22,676 --> 00:19:27,080
Very loose framing, no sound in this particular sequence.

383
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,681
Music.

384
00:19:27,681 --> 00:19:29,803
We, the audience, do not know where

385
00:19:29,803 --> 00:19:30,803
the bullets are coming from.

386
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:36,263
closer in, but Paul Newman knows.

387
00:19:36,263 --> 00:19:38,444
The rest are still looking around,

388
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:40,565
but he's completely still.

389
00:19:40,565 --> 00:19:44,668
Finally, he's accepted his fate with resignation.

390
00:19:44,668 --> 00:19:46,409
It's all told with pictures and no sound.

391
00:19:46,409 --> 00:19:47,369
So his son has been waiting up.

392
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:48,590
Tom Hanks' son has been waiting up all night,

393
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:52,452
not knowing if his father's dead or alive.

394
00:19:52,452 --> 00:19:58,576
And that doorway separates him from what we know.

395
00:19:58,576 --> 00:20:01,898
The doorway is a deliberate framing device.

396
00:20:03,968 --> 00:20:06,068
Now, in Raise the Red Lantern, the director

397
00:20:06,068 --> 00:20:10,370
wanted us to feel the same distance, the same disconnect,

398
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:13,571
that the latest wife feels as she enters her new life.

399
00:20:13,571 --> 00:20:16,912
Her new husband, whom she rarely sees, is a mystery to her.

400
00:20:16,912 --> 00:20:22,093
So the director mimics this with the visual idea

401
00:20:22,093 --> 00:20:26,515
of never letting the audience see him either.

402
00:20:26,515 --> 00:20:29,436
He's always shown in a far shot or from the back.

403
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:32,637
So we're kept in the dark as to his appearance.

404
00:20:35,963 --> 00:20:38,404
Once film went digital, everything changed.

405
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:46,269
With a digital intermediate, whole scenes could be altered,

406
00:20:46,269 --> 00:20:47,650
color schemes twisted, manipulated,

407
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,511
contrast ratios completely clamped,

408
00:20:49,511 --> 00:20:51,192
white points completely shifted.

409
00:20:51,192 --> 00:20:54,013
Creates a whole other visual reality,

410
00:20:54,013 --> 00:20:57,936
and one that only exists in that particular film.

411
00:20:57,936 --> 00:21:01,878
It's unique signature, as you were.

412
00:21:01,878 --> 00:21:04,500
These are from Jean Junot's latest film called Mic Mac.

413
00:21:06,376 --> 00:21:08,497
He has a definite color palette in mind,

414
00:21:08,497 --> 00:21:11,898
one that lends a surreal edge to this film.

415
00:21:11,898 --> 00:21:15,319
And if it were color time so that everything was normal,

416
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:18,241
I think it would really lessen the type of story

417
00:21:18,241 --> 00:21:19,301
he's telling.

418
00:21:19,301 --> 00:21:22,502
So let's see what happens when we take out that color shift.

419
00:21:22,502 --> 00:21:23,303
Not as interesting.

420
00:21:23,303 --> 00:21:24,363
It's pretty ordinary, actually.

421
00:21:24,363 --> 00:21:24,843
So let's put it back.

422
00:21:33,729 --> 00:21:35,951
So his films all have a rule set to themselves.

423
00:21:35,951 --> 00:21:40,895
It's a slightly altered version of reality.

424
00:21:40,895 --> 00:21:45,839
So it's natural the visuals reflect and support that.

425
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:54,185
His use of extreme wide angles and very theatrical lighting help sell that idea.

426
00:22:01,435 --> 00:22:04,516
Same thing with Munich photographed by Janusz Kaminski.

427
00:22:04,516 --> 00:22:06,156
Different rule set.

428
00:22:06,156 --> 00:22:09,657
This film tends towards a higher contrast look

429
00:22:09,657 --> 00:22:11,297
with lots of heavy filtration.

430
00:22:11,297 --> 00:22:13,298
And these are just tools.

431
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:16,319
And they're used to create a style,

432
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:17,659
just as any artist would.

433
00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:20,960
So what are some of the tools or choices, and why?

434
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,382
Each artist makes choices based on many factors.

435
00:22:26,382 --> 00:22:30,683
But they should be choices, and deliberate artistic choices.

436
00:22:31,314 --> 00:22:38,776
Hero, photographed by the Australian cinematographer Christopher Doyle, is one of the most stylized films in recent memory.

437
00:22:38,776 --> 00:22:41,857
He and the director really pushed the idea of color for this film.

438
00:22:41,857 --> 00:22:44,677
Each section had its own strong and very unique palette.

439
00:22:44,677 --> 00:22:45,477
Gray and magenta.

440
00:22:45,477 --> 00:22:47,038
Green and blue-gray.

441
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:47,218
Gray.

442
00:22:47,218 --> 00:22:47,578
All blue.

443
00:22:47,578 --> 00:22:48,178
Red-orange.

444
00:23:02,459 --> 00:23:04,881
They're all for emotional reasons.

445
00:23:04,881 --> 00:23:06,461
Sleepy Hollow is another good example,

446
00:23:06,461 --> 00:23:08,663
but for shape, probably more than strong color.

447
00:23:08,663 --> 00:23:12,125
Even though most of this is a matte painting,

448
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:14,987
it still has a very strong Tim Burton feel to it.

449
00:23:14,987 --> 00:23:18,329
The film was photographed by Emanuel Lebesgue,

450
00:23:18,329 --> 00:23:20,910
who's really known for his soft light.

451
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:23,912
But you can definitely see Tim's influence.

452
00:23:23,912 --> 00:23:27,334
The shape and the sensibility are his alone.

453
00:23:29,678 --> 00:23:32,019
All of these things we consider when we're making a game.

454
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:33,780
This is an overview of a color script

455
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,920
that we use to map out the emotional beats

456
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,101
as the story progresses.

457
00:23:37,101 --> 00:23:40,001
More detailed section of the lighting change

458
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,442
that's going to take place within the game, in this case,

459
00:23:42,442 --> 00:23:43,022
the cargo plane.

460
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:46,823
And a different overview of just color bars

461
00:23:46,823 --> 00:23:50,684
we look at to map out where we want the visual design

462
00:23:50,684 --> 00:23:51,745
to be over the entire game.

463
00:23:53,235 --> 00:23:55,458
So where we go next is anyone's guess.

464
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:57,540
It's exciting, but it's unknown.

465
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,523
And for the time being, it still needs

466
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:01,285
to take place in a frame of some kind.

467
00:24:01,285 --> 00:24:04,149
And it still needs to use the rules of picture making

468
00:24:04,149 --> 00:24:08,214
we have developed as a species for the past 2,000 years.

469
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:08,394
Thanks.
