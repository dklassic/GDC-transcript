00:00:06,242 --> 00:00:11,146
Hello. My name is Ian. I'm an accessibility specialist, and I'm here to talk to you about

2
00:00:11,206 --> 00:00:17,231
subtitles. And I'm going to start with a little bit of audience participation, because I know

3
00:00:17,272 --> 00:00:22,036
everybody loves that. So I'd like to see a show of hands of how many of you have played

4
00:00:22,076 --> 00:00:31,084
with subtitles turned on. That's a healthy slice of the crowd. And that actually tallies

5
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:31,224
up.

6
00:00:31,662 --> 00:00:33,102
with usage data.

7
00:00:33,282 --> 00:00:35,403
There's a game a few of you might have heard of

8
00:00:35,463 --> 00:00:36,883
called Assassin's Creed Origins.

9
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:40,384
Assassin's Creed Origins actually tracked usage data

10
00:00:40,484 --> 00:00:42,905
on how many of their players played with subtitles turned on

11
00:00:43,665 --> 00:00:45,366
and it was averaged across all platforms,

12
00:00:45,486 --> 00:00:47,606
just over 60% of their players.

13
00:00:49,187 --> 00:00:50,347
So this is of all kinds of reasons.

14
00:00:50,387 --> 00:00:51,908
I mean, I know there's at least two people

15
00:00:51,928 --> 00:00:54,609
in the audience here who are deaf and hard of hearing.

16
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:56,949
I bet there are a lot of people here who aren't as well.

17
00:00:57,489 --> 00:00:58,430
Maybe your subtitles,

18
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,230
because they're playing in a noisy room.

19
00:01:00,974 --> 00:01:03,456
because they're playing on low-quality audio hardware,

20
00:01:04,536 --> 00:01:06,818
because audio mixes in games are unpredictable.

21
00:01:06,978 --> 00:01:08,660
You never know when there's going to be an explosion.

22
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,581
At the same time, it's an important exposition.

23
00:01:12,103 --> 00:01:13,804
Also, because your baby's asleep.

24
00:01:14,204 --> 00:01:16,126
The only chance you get to play is when your baby's asleep,

25
00:01:16,146 --> 00:01:17,867
and you don't want to wake him up, so you play on mute.

26
00:01:18,148 --> 00:01:20,309
There's all kinds of reasons why people use subtitles.

27
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,372
So they can have a really, really profound impact

28
00:01:23,412 --> 00:01:26,575
on how enjoyable the experience of your game

29
00:01:26,655 --> 00:01:27,996
is for most of your players.

30
00:01:30,387 --> 00:01:32,669
So it obviously justifies doing a good job of them.

31
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:34,810
But nobody does.

32
00:01:35,591 --> 00:01:38,494
There are no good subtitles in the games industry.

33
00:01:38,614 --> 00:01:40,155
And I do mean in all of your games.

34
00:01:42,377 --> 00:01:44,559
So who am I to be here judging your games?

35
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,180
I'm sure there's people feeling defensive, right?

36
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:46,841
I probably haven't.

37
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:48,062
Well, I may not have played your game.

38
00:01:48,582 --> 00:01:50,384
But I'm actually not talking from my perspective.

39
00:01:50,604 --> 00:01:51,805
I am quoting gamers.

40
00:01:53,286 --> 00:01:55,228
So this is a selection of quotes just

41
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:58,351
from one single NeoGAF thread.

42
00:02:09,787 --> 00:02:11,728
So most gaming subtitles are ass.

43
00:02:11,868 --> 00:02:12,849
I think you get the general idea.

44
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,251
So what is it people are complaining about?

45
00:02:16,331 --> 00:02:18,533
Well, they're complaining about stuff like this.

46
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,215
So there is going to be quite a bit of this in this

47
00:02:22,255 --> 00:02:22,696
presentation.

48
00:02:22,716 --> 00:02:25,098
There are going to be quite a few examples of games that are

49
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:26,899
not doing things so well.

50
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:29,240
I'm not going to name these games, even if you do

51
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,182
recognize them, even if they are a game you worked on.

52
00:02:31,662 --> 00:02:33,984
I don't want to do anyone down at all.

53
00:02:34,324 --> 00:02:34,904
There's reasons.

54
00:02:34,945 --> 00:02:36,125
There's production issues.

55
00:02:36,145 --> 00:02:36,926
There's lack of awareness.

56
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,063
If you're doing this kind of stuff,

57
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,044
you're not a bad person at all.

58
00:02:39,244 --> 00:02:40,645
I'm just trying to give you some information

59
00:02:40,685 --> 00:02:41,706
so you can do better in the future.

60
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:46,931
So this is the kind of things people are complaining about.

61
00:02:47,431 --> 00:02:49,373
There's three main issues above all else

62
00:02:49,393 --> 00:02:50,294
that people complain about.

63
00:02:50,374 --> 00:02:53,297
It's size, contrast, amount of text that's on the screen.

64
00:02:53,597 --> 00:02:55,299
It's really not rocket science to sort out.

65
00:02:57,781 --> 00:03:00,163
So this is an example of more what you should be aiming for

66
00:03:00,784 --> 00:03:01,344
as a base level.

67
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:07,223
So you can see here there's a clear, easy-to-read font.

68
00:03:07,663 --> 00:03:09,044
There isn't too much text on the screen.

69
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,745
It's easy to distinguish from the background.

70
00:03:12,305 --> 00:03:14,446
And the reason why I said as a base level

71
00:03:14,646 --> 00:03:16,407
is because there is actually different use cases

72
00:03:16,427 --> 00:03:17,328
for subtitles, right?

73
00:03:17,628 --> 00:03:20,769
So some people are deaf and need to understand

74
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,230
every single word that's on the screen

75
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,591
and need them to be as clear and obvious as possible.

76
00:03:25,752 --> 00:03:26,552
Other end of the spectrum.

77
00:03:27,192 --> 00:03:30,014
people who just have subtitles on to glance at occasionally,

78
00:03:30,234 --> 00:03:32,655
just in case, like I said earlier, an explosion goes off

79
00:03:32,695 --> 00:03:33,736
in the middle of some exposition.

80
00:03:34,156 --> 00:03:36,217
You want the subtitles to be really unnoticeable

81
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:37,818
until that moment they glance at them.

82
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:43,562
So, actually, each one of these examples

83
00:03:44,482 --> 00:03:47,224
is the preferred approach for a certain group,

84
00:03:48,184 --> 00:03:49,545
which gives you a bit of a problem, right?

85
00:03:50,205 --> 00:03:51,006
Which one do you choose?

86
00:03:53,307 --> 00:03:55,688
Well, the joy of digital media, including games,

87
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:56,729
is you don't have to choose.

88
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,632
you can just provide options and let people choose themselves.

89
00:04:01,013 --> 00:04:02,754
So as I go through these practices,

90
00:04:02,874 --> 00:04:04,555
keep that in mind, the principle of options.

91
00:04:04,575 --> 00:04:06,637
I'm going to revisit the principle of options

92
00:04:06,657 --> 00:04:07,318
at the end as well.

93
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,042
So I'm going to move on to practices now.

94
00:04:13,703 --> 00:04:15,324
There's a whole bunch of good practices you can use.

95
00:04:15,404 --> 00:04:17,866
A lot of these are just from other industries,

96
00:04:17,886 --> 00:04:20,388
from TV and film, who've been doing this stuff for decades.

97
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,871
And people have been talking about these good practices

98
00:04:24,771 --> 00:04:26,452
in the games industry for a long time.

99
00:04:26,672 --> 00:04:30,713
So why am I here now in 2019 talking to you about this stuff?

100
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,134
It's because the industry is changing.

101
00:04:34,094 --> 00:04:36,815
It's because finally, after all that advocacy by so many people,

102
00:04:37,755 --> 00:04:38,995
studios are starting to do this stuff.

103
00:04:40,376 --> 00:04:42,696
Subtitles are beginning to evolve from terrible to bad.

104
00:04:43,096 --> 00:04:44,357
Soon they'll be good, soon they'll be great.

105
00:04:46,757 --> 00:04:50,058
And when games like Spider-Man, like Assassin's Creed,

106
00:04:51,798 --> 00:04:54,579
like Shadow the Tomb Raider.

107
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,361
Shadow the Tomb Raider, sorry.

108
00:04:58,681 --> 00:05:01,883
Like when big AAA-named games like that do stuff like this,

109
00:05:02,123 --> 00:05:02,763
people notice.

110
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:05,225
Other developers notice and copy them.

111
00:05:06,165 --> 00:05:08,927
Gamers notice, and their expectations change.

112
00:05:10,948 --> 00:05:13,229
So I'm sure everyone's familiar with WoW and with Spyro.

113
00:05:14,109 --> 00:05:16,410
It doesn't just apply to Weather and Lucky Gobstar titles, though.

114
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,611
It goes into the fine details.

115
00:05:18,435 --> 00:05:21,057
So when Assassin's Creed Origins that I showed,

116
00:05:21,098 --> 00:05:22,399
when that came out a couple of years ago,

117
00:05:23,059 --> 00:05:26,382
it had options for text size, it had options for backgrounds,

118
00:05:26,422 --> 00:05:27,483
it had options for speaker name.

119
00:05:27,863 --> 00:05:29,164
It won awards because of that.

120
00:05:30,345 --> 00:05:32,407
Fast forward to today, Metro Exodus comes out,

121
00:05:33,227 --> 00:05:35,329
reaction for the community, yeah, cool.

122
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:36,550
It kind of does what we expect.

123
00:05:37,351 --> 00:05:39,753
So expectations change, they change quickly.

124
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,375
So I can guarantee you that if you're starting work

125
00:05:42,395 --> 00:05:45,157
in a game now, there are things that are not even seen

126
00:05:45,197 --> 00:05:46,738
in games yet that will be expected

127
00:05:46,778 --> 00:05:47,719
by the time the game launches.

128
00:05:48,844 --> 00:05:52,025
So that's what I'm hoping from this, that this is a good time to revisit all those principles

129
00:05:52,065 --> 00:05:54,625
and hopefully allow you to get a bit ahead of that curve.

130
00:05:55,025 --> 00:05:59,066
And rather than fall victim to those changing expectations, actually be the people setting

131
00:05:59,086 --> 00:05:59,886
those expectations.

132
00:06:02,387 --> 00:06:06,887
So as you can see, three basics, also some best practices, and if we've got time as well,

133
00:06:07,007 --> 00:06:09,748
a couple of closing thoughts on some other related things.

134
00:06:12,228 --> 00:06:13,909
Basics number one, size.

135
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:16,929
Size.

136
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:18,630
Obvious problem here.

137
00:06:19,938 --> 00:06:23,261
And the thing is that kind of text size, that can look entirely reasonable to you

138
00:06:23,681 --> 00:06:26,063
when you're developing on your nice big screen

139
00:06:26,103 --> 00:06:27,324
about a foot away from your face.

140
00:06:28,185 --> 00:06:30,567
Even for people who've got no kind of vision loss whatsoever,

141
00:06:31,047 --> 00:06:33,569
if you're sat ten feet from a 40-inch screen,

142
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:34,790
it's a very, very different story.

143
00:06:39,374 --> 00:06:41,075
So this is what you should be aiming for.

144
00:06:41,336 --> 00:06:42,737
This is from Far Cry New Dawn.

145
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,380
And there is actually a size to design to as well.

146
00:06:47,046 --> 00:06:48,906
So again, if you look outside at other industries,

147
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:52,227
if you look at Amazon's 10-fit UI guidelines,

148
00:06:52,888 --> 00:06:55,208
if you look at Channel 4's sub-targeting guidelines,

149
00:06:55,228 --> 00:06:56,488
this kind of stuff is already defined.

150
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,931
So this is the figure to work to, at least 46 pixels at 1080p.

151
00:07:07,091 --> 00:07:08,072
I'm sure there's people in the room who

152
00:07:08,092 --> 00:07:11,452
are imagining some interesting discussions with art directors

153
00:07:11,713 --> 00:07:13,313
over including text of that size.

154
00:07:14,073 --> 00:07:14,953
But again, options.

155
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,101
If somebody wants to have tiny, tiny subtitles in their game,

156
00:07:19,501 --> 00:07:22,022
let them design that, but at least offer the option

157
00:07:22,062 --> 00:07:23,983
so that people who can't read that can bump it up.

158
00:07:26,204 --> 00:07:26,504
Like this.

159
00:07:32,046 --> 00:07:34,187
So, basic number two, contrast.

160
00:07:34,547 --> 00:07:37,068
Again, this is an obvious issue.

161
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,349
So there are a few techniques you can use to get around this.

162
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:45,930
You could try putting an outline on the text,

163
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,311
you could put a drop shadow on the text,

164
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:49,753
but those approaches themselves have issues,

165
00:07:51,034 --> 00:07:52,254
particularly for dyslexia.

166
00:07:52,775 --> 00:07:53,955
So there's a lot of people who,

167
00:07:54,616 --> 00:07:56,677
if there's some kind of imagery behind the text,

168
00:07:57,037 --> 00:07:58,338
that interferes with letter shapes

169
00:07:58,398 --> 00:07:59,539
and makes it really difficult to read.

170
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:01,560
So if you are offering outlines,

171
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,241
if you are offering drop shadows, great,

172
00:08:03,462 --> 00:08:06,644
but also offer something like this in Spider-Man.

173
00:08:07,164 --> 00:08:08,385
So they have the option to turn on.

174
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:13,822
a black box behind it, which is called letterboxing, and ideally allow people to adjust the transparency

175
00:08:13,842 --> 00:08:21,968
of that as well. Basic number three, the amount of text per

176
00:08:21,988 --> 00:08:26,251
subtitle. And this relates to two things, really. The first one is the amount of text

177
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:35,057
that is in a single line. Like this. It also relates to the number of lines that are in

178
00:08:35,117 --> 00:08:37,239
a subtitle. Like this.

179
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,737
So again, you can see from the reaction

180
00:08:42,757 --> 00:08:46,339
that these seems like obvious problems, but they still appear.

181
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,480
And this is what you should be aiming for instead.

182
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,021
So this is an example from The Witness.

183
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,562
And you can see here, as well as having

184
00:08:52,722 --> 00:08:55,424
a reasonable amount of text per line, a reasonable number

185
00:08:55,444 --> 00:08:57,645
of lines, it's also got a sensible line break

186
00:08:57,665 --> 00:08:58,426
in the middle.

187
00:08:59,066 --> 00:09:01,968
That text string has been manually broken at a point

188
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,008
that makes editorial sense.

189
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:06,670
And again, from looking at other industries,

190
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,731
just looking slightly sideways at other screen-based

191
00:09:08,771 --> 00:09:09,132
industries.

192
00:09:09,603 --> 00:09:11,845
you can find guidelines to work to.

193
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,026
And this is what should be.

194
00:09:15,027 --> 00:09:18,250
Maximum of two lines per subtitle, maybe three sometimes.

195
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:19,170
Try and avoid it, though.

196
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,552
And a maximum of 38 characters per line.

197
00:09:23,994 --> 00:09:24,835
So that's the basics.

198
00:09:24,895 --> 00:09:26,556
Those are the things that you really, really

199
00:09:26,656 --> 00:09:27,537
have to be considering.

200
00:09:27,637 --> 00:09:28,858
And you can see from those examples,

201
00:09:28,978 --> 00:09:31,220
if you don't consider those things, what you have

202
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,320
really isn't subtitles.

203
00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:33,722
They are not functional.

204
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,620
So next I'm going to talk about some good practices.

205
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,601
So this is the way to go a bit above and beyond

206
00:09:39,861 --> 00:09:42,042
and move from beyond functional subtitles

207
00:09:42,202 --> 00:09:44,862
to actually usable subtitles, enjoyable subtitles,

208
00:09:44,902 --> 00:09:46,863
subtitles that are useful and pleasant to read.

209
00:09:50,004 --> 00:09:51,224
And the first one is accuracy.

210
00:09:52,605 --> 00:09:53,765
Make sure that your subtitles

211
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:54,966
actually match what's being said.

212
00:09:55,326 --> 00:09:57,687
You can't rely on your voice actors

213
00:09:57,967 --> 00:09:59,787
having perfectly stuck to the script.

214
00:10:02,508 --> 00:10:03,568
And people really do notice.

215
00:10:06,637 --> 00:10:09,198
And you can guarantee, as well as it being a pain to use,

216
00:10:09,218 --> 00:10:10,918
you can guarantee that every single typo,

217
00:10:11,098 --> 00:10:14,019
there will be somebody posting a screenshot of it,

218
00:10:14,119 --> 00:10:15,280
correcting the typos in there.

219
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,660
You can look up examples from Last of Us if you really want to.

220
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,901
So yeah, make sure that you really need to do a QA pass

221
00:10:21,341 --> 00:10:23,282
on your subtitle text to make sure it all matches up.

222
00:10:28,464 --> 00:10:29,484
Second one, comprehensive.

223
00:10:29,544 --> 00:10:31,905
Make sure that everything is actually subtitled.

224
00:10:32,405 --> 00:10:34,445
Seems kind of obvious, but often you see games where...

225
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,756
either the gameplay of subtitles and the cutscenes aren't,

226
00:10:37,836 --> 00:10:40,337
or vice versa, or a really, really common one,

227
00:10:42,278 --> 00:10:44,719
the opening cinematic isn't subtitles.

228
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,821
Often that can be because the option to turn on the subtitles

229
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:50,622
isn't available until you get to the options screen,

230
00:10:50,642 --> 00:10:52,423
which doesn't appear until after the cutscene.

231
00:10:53,963 --> 00:10:56,784
So based on the usage data I was talking about earlier,

232
00:10:57,004 --> 00:10:58,825
you know, Assassin's Creed Origins,

233
00:10:59,145 --> 00:11:01,226
60% of their players playing with subtitles turned on,

234
00:11:01,586 --> 00:11:04,848
the usage data actually supports having subtitles turned on by default.

235
00:11:06,102 --> 00:11:08,523
But if you don't, at least allow people the means of doing so.

236
00:11:09,424 --> 00:11:10,165
Like in Infamous.

237
00:11:11,766 --> 00:11:15,568
So in Infamous, as soon as, or just before the first person starts speaking

238
00:11:15,588 --> 00:11:17,210
the opening cinematic, you get that little prompt

239
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,651
to allow people to turn them on.

240
00:11:24,535 --> 00:11:25,636
Number three, central.

241
00:11:26,576 --> 00:11:29,719
Put your subtitles at the bottom in the middle.

242
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,622
Not up the top, not down at the bottom right.

243
00:11:35,845 --> 00:11:37,525
So I don't mind using this example of Forza

244
00:11:37,545 --> 00:11:39,585
because actually John Knowles gave a talk on Monday

245
00:11:40,085 --> 00:11:41,866
highlighting the same thing and telling people,

246
00:11:41,906 --> 00:11:43,906
don't do what we did, so don't do what they did.

247
00:11:49,527 --> 00:11:50,967
Number four, add them from the bottom.

248
00:11:51,968 --> 00:11:53,388
This doesn't actually come up very often.

249
00:11:53,868 --> 00:11:55,728
It came up here.

250
00:11:56,688 --> 00:11:58,569
So in this example, you can see

251
00:11:58,609 --> 00:12:00,089
there's two different people speaking,

252
00:12:00,549 --> 00:12:02,890
actually with indication of which speaker is which,

253
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:03,430
which is nice.

254
00:12:04,744 --> 00:12:07,526
In this game, they were aiming at consistency.

255
00:12:07,746 --> 00:12:10,688
So when each person spoke, they tried

256
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:11,949
to keep the position consistent.

257
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:14,070
So they tried to keep speaker two always at the bottom,

258
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,091
speaker one always at the top.

259
00:12:15,671 --> 00:12:17,272
Really, really confused people.

260
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:20,875
So generally speaking, most of the time,

261
00:12:20,915 --> 00:12:22,596
you'll only have one subtitle on the screen.

262
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:24,197
That's how most subtitle systems work.

263
00:12:25,095 --> 00:12:27,376
If you don't, if for some reason you need to have lots on there,

264
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:30,417
like in the Division 2 or way back in Left 4 Dead,

265
00:12:30,637 --> 00:12:33,339
where you have lots of subtitles, just keep scrolling them up from the bottom

266
00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:34,339
and knocking the top one off.

267
00:12:42,842 --> 00:12:45,283
Number five, indicate who is speaking.

268
00:12:50,205 --> 00:12:52,206
Like this. So this example from the start.

269
00:12:52,746 --> 00:12:54,487
Simply putting the name of the speaker on there.

270
00:12:55,472 --> 00:12:57,533
And there's other games that have variations on this,

271
00:12:57,593 --> 00:12:59,794
sometimes showing the little portrait next to the name as well.

272
00:13:00,535 --> 00:13:02,196
Some games, again, back to the last example,

273
00:13:02,236 --> 00:13:05,278
do it by using color to separate the speakers.

274
00:13:06,498 --> 00:13:08,740
Color can be really preferential for some people.

275
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,441
It's an instant quick recognition.

276
00:13:11,021 --> 00:13:13,382
But people who use subtitles

277
00:13:13,763 --> 00:13:15,864
are no less likely to be colorblind than anyone else.

278
00:13:16,825 --> 00:13:18,125
So if you are taking this approach,

279
00:13:18,245 --> 00:13:21,247
at least give people the option to have the written speaker names as well.

280
00:13:27,861 --> 00:13:29,841
Number six, indicate direction.

281
00:13:30,942 --> 00:13:33,982
This is something that is very, very rarely seen in games,

282
00:13:34,082 --> 00:13:36,062
but in other media, it's standard.

283
00:13:36,402 --> 00:13:38,383
Like if you watch a TV, in the UK at least,

284
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,503
if you watch a TV program on the BBC,

285
00:13:41,023 --> 00:13:43,104
anytime there is a speaker who is out of shot,

286
00:13:43,664 --> 00:13:45,504
it shows a little arrow next to their name,

287
00:13:45,984 --> 00:13:47,204
pointing to the direction where they are.

288
00:13:49,005 --> 00:13:51,205
An example of a game that does this is Minecraft.

289
00:13:53,906 --> 00:13:55,686
So you can see here, that little arrow.

290
00:13:56,643 --> 00:13:59,065
to the left and to the right to show you which direction something's in.

291
00:13:59,445 --> 00:14:01,687
Now, Minecraft, actually, in the early stages of development,

292
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:05,149
they had a much more complex, comprehensive approach than this.

293
00:14:05,249 --> 00:14:06,990
They basically had, like, a 3D compass

294
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,731
showing you exactly where the sound effects were.

295
00:14:09,572 --> 00:14:11,933
They actually took that out and stripped it back

296
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:13,414
on the basis of competition.

297
00:14:14,235 --> 00:14:16,256
They figured out that if people are playing online,

298
00:14:16,696 --> 00:14:19,698
that level of information is actually way, way more accurate

299
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:20,739
than what you get from sound.

300
00:14:21,703 --> 00:14:24,325
So they scaled it back a bit to make the amount of information

301
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:27,127
you get through the text equivalent to what you get through stereo speakers.

302
00:14:28,908 --> 00:14:33,352
But not every game strips it back like that. Division 2 has this.

303
00:14:33,712 --> 00:14:35,453
It's a little bit hard to see from the screenshot,

304
00:14:35,493 --> 00:14:38,375
but Division 2 basically does exactly the same thing

305
00:14:38,776 --> 00:14:41,398
as the early prototype of Minecraft.

306
00:14:42,238 --> 00:14:44,680
So their captions actually update to show you

307
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,382
exactly where in 3D space they're coming from.

308
00:14:56,472 --> 00:15:00,552
Number seven, give people enough time to read the subtitles.

309
00:15:02,573 --> 00:15:05,113
So this, on the surface of it, seems pretty straightforward.

310
00:15:05,133 --> 00:15:06,674
Don't have them flying past really quickly.

311
00:15:08,634 --> 00:15:10,855
But the reality of it is that people speak quickly.

312
00:15:12,095 --> 00:15:15,936
You are going to be in situations where there is just loads of audio

313
00:15:15,996 --> 00:15:16,936
going on at the same time.

314
00:15:22,697 --> 00:15:25,318
And in those circumstances, meeting these guidelines.

315
00:15:25,946 --> 00:15:26,486
can be tricky.

316
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,068
And what you need to resort to in those circumstances

317
00:15:30,148 --> 00:15:31,589
is editing the subtitles.

318
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:33,830
Now, editing the subtitles is something

319
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,951
that you shouldn't do unless it's a real last resort.

320
00:15:36,031 --> 00:15:37,792
Wherever possible, it should always

321
00:15:37,892 --> 00:15:39,253
match exactly what's being spoken.

322
00:15:40,233 --> 00:15:42,574
But in those circumstances where there's lots of stuff going on,

323
00:15:43,255 --> 00:15:44,175
you can edit.

324
00:15:44,215 --> 00:15:46,276
For example, if someone's saying, like, no, no, no, no,

325
00:15:46,296 --> 00:15:48,757
no, like edit that down to just one line, that kind of thing

326
00:15:48,777 --> 00:15:49,758
can just about get away with.

327
00:15:50,378 --> 00:15:51,058
It's a bit of an art.

328
00:15:51,904 --> 00:15:56,406
There are actually professional captioners who do this kind of stuff day in, day out,

329
00:15:56,526 --> 00:15:58,106
who know exactly how to do this stuff.

330
00:15:58,306 --> 00:15:59,927
If you can hire one of those people, amazing.

331
00:16:00,747 --> 00:16:03,369
If you can't, check out the BBC's guidelines.

332
00:16:03,549 --> 00:16:07,811
That's actually where these guidelines themselves come from.

333
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:12,032
But they also have a ton of good information on exactly how to do all those tricky bits

334
00:16:12,052 --> 00:16:12,433
of editing.

335
00:16:12,453 --> 00:16:15,834
And these are their guidelines.

336
00:16:16,982 --> 00:16:19,543
And even just in general, please check out these guidelines.

337
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,024
There's a ton of really, really good stuff.

338
00:16:21,224 --> 00:16:24,785
And like I said, this is an industry that's been doing subtitling for decades.

339
00:16:25,065 --> 00:16:28,107
There's a lot of good information behind this, so please, please read this.

340
00:16:28,267 --> 00:16:30,248
There's a lot of good stuff you can take out of that for your games.

341
00:16:40,211 --> 00:16:41,852
Number eight, clear font.

342
00:16:43,695 --> 00:16:46,578
This is where we start getting into interesting discussions

343
00:16:46,618 --> 00:16:47,578
with art directors again,

344
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,140
about things like this.

345
00:16:53,363 --> 00:16:55,945
So in this game, the reason for this text

346
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,806
was to keep it on brand.

347
00:16:58,707 --> 00:17:01,229
This was a text that was used throughout the rest of the game's interface.

348
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:03,010
It was keeping it consistent with the feel.

349
00:17:04,771 --> 00:17:07,994
But that clashes directly with it being easy to read,

350
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:09,935
especially using full caps.

351
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:14,752
If you're using full caps, that means you lose out on word shape, everything is just

352
00:17:14,832 --> 00:17:18,594
like a plain rectangle, the outline of the word, which is quite a big deal if you're

353
00:17:18,614 --> 00:17:20,115
expecting people to read it at speed.

354
00:17:21,836 --> 00:17:26,639
And also it's a bit hard to tell in the screenshot, it's a bit low resolution, sorry, but that's

355
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:30,121
actually in copperplate font, which is like a serif font as well.

356
00:17:34,383 --> 00:17:35,564
So this is what you should be aiming for.

357
00:17:36,845 --> 00:17:37,805
Clear Sans Serif font.

358
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,619
and in sentence case, not full caps.

359
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:45,120
And again, like I said, this might lead to some interesting discussions with art directors.

360
00:17:45,461 --> 00:17:47,421
Like, if art directors really want to do this kind of stuff,

361
00:17:47,621 --> 00:17:50,583
and, you know, there are people who literally, obviously, it is their job to ensure,

362
00:17:50,623 --> 00:17:53,724
like, brand consistency and emotional impact and that kind of stuff.

363
00:17:54,544 --> 00:17:57,285
You know, if you've got people in your team who want to do this kind of stuff, let them do it.

364
00:17:58,246 --> 00:18:01,067
But also have an option so that people who can't read that

365
00:18:02,007 --> 00:18:03,868
can customize it to something that suits their needs.

366
00:18:13,946 --> 00:18:16,487
Number nine, this is a biggie, captions.

367
00:18:18,587 --> 00:18:20,988
So the definitions, the terminology,

368
00:18:21,108 --> 00:18:23,488
vary a little bit from country to country.

369
00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:26,569
But in most places, the difference

370
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:29,430
in terminology between subtitles and between captions

371
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:33,691
is that subtitles relates to speech specifically.

372
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,952
And that can be for localization as well as accessibility.

373
00:18:37,432 --> 00:18:40,113
Captions refers to audio as well.

374
00:18:40,713 --> 00:18:42,153
It refers to translating everything

375
00:18:42,193 --> 00:18:43,553
that you need to be able to hear.

376
00:18:44,068 --> 00:18:53,432
into text. Things like this. So this is from Shadow of the Tomb Raider. You can see where

377
00:18:53,452 --> 00:19:01,295
it says wind screaming there. So this is something that's been really, really rare in games.

378
00:19:01,895 --> 00:19:08,377
Not in other media. So in TV, cinema. Honestly, when you're flying back from, I'm seeing most

379
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:09,398
of you flying back from GDC.

380
00:19:10,261 --> 00:19:14,384
Turn on the movie, watch it, you'll see a lot of the things I'm talking about here,

381
00:19:14,805 --> 00:19:18,648
decent text size, speaker indication, closed captions for background sounds,

382
00:19:19,148 --> 00:19:19,468
are there.

383
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:22,430
We just need to bring it across into this industry as well.

384
00:19:22,991 --> 00:19:24,052
There have been some examples.

385
00:19:24,752 --> 00:19:26,854
Early pioneer of this was Valve.

386
00:19:27,995 --> 00:19:31,057
And Valve, it was kind of reactive.

387
00:19:31,517 --> 00:19:35,080
So the first Half-Life game, it had no subtitles at all.

388
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,042
And this was in the days before social media, the days before Reddit.

389
00:19:39,182 --> 00:19:41,363
So they didn't have lots of angry people on social media.

390
00:19:41,383 --> 00:19:44,605
They had people writing polite letters to them, saying, you know,

391
00:19:44,665 --> 00:19:46,827
I'm deaf. Do you have a transcript?

392
00:19:46,847 --> 00:19:48,208
I've heard Half-Life has got a good story.

393
00:19:48,248 --> 00:19:49,168
I'd love to know what they're saying.

394
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:52,070
So Valve were like, no, no, OK, forget transcripts.

395
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,651
From now on, we are going to do this properly.

396
00:19:53,991 --> 00:19:56,473
And from that point, just ensure that any time they do user research,

397
00:19:56,893 --> 00:19:59,355
they include people with hearing loss in their user research.

398
00:20:00,496 --> 00:20:02,757
That resulted in them having closed captioning.

399
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,509
But all the background sounds in Half-Life 2,

400
00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:08,010
in Portal, and Portal 2 really pushed the industry forward.

401
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,310
And it's only now that we're starting

402
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,611
to see more games doing this.

403
00:20:12,292 --> 00:20:14,072
So Shadow of the Tomb Raider, a really nice example.

404
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,754
Division 2, another really nice example.

405
00:20:18,774 --> 00:20:20,255
So I already showed that screenshot earlier

406
00:20:20,535 --> 00:20:22,916
of those captions with the direction arrows on.

407
00:20:23,876 --> 00:20:25,597
Ubisoft are doing really nice work on this.

408
00:20:26,177 --> 00:20:28,558
I'd also recommend checking out Far Cry New Dawn.

409
00:20:29,139 --> 00:20:31,400
That has similar functionality to Division 2.

410
00:20:31,845 --> 00:20:34,067
and just tons of really good accessibility stuff in general.

411
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:37,128
So for a really nice showcase, just those two Ubisoft games.

412
00:20:37,388 --> 00:20:40,510
I don't want to big up Ubisoft too much, there's loads of other people doing good things,

413
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:43,132
but Division 2, Far Cry New Dawn, please check them out.

414
00:20:44,933 --> 00:20:46,634
And there's something else that's really, really nice here

415
00:20:46,674 --> 00:20:49,315
that I've only seen a few games do, which is at the bottom,

416
00:20:49,835 --> 00:20:52,497
it actually shows you an example of what it's going to look like.

417
00:20:52,617 --> 00:20:55,839
It shows you a preview of the actual presentation, the actual size,

418
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:58,660
so that people can see it in-situ without having to do trial and error

419
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,622
of going back and forwards. So please do that as well.

420
00:21:02,282 --> 00:21:04,163
And that kind of brings me on to the last one neatly,

421
00:21:04,323 --> 00:21:05,283
which is options.

422
00:21:05,904 --> 00:21:07,525
So in all these various different ones,

423
00:21:07,565 --> 00:21:10,066
I've been talking about options, talking about customizing.

424
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,589
This is an example set of the kind of things

425
00:21:14,629 --> 00:21:15,230
that you can offer.

426
00:21:17,731 --> 00:21:20,733
And in some industries, this kind of stuff isn't optional.

427
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:28,418
So if you are actually, it may apply to games.

428
00:21:29,258 --> 00:21:30,959
I don't want to say it won't ever apply to games,

429
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:31,280
because.

430
00:21:31,893 --> 00:21:33,954
somebody somewhere is going to have some idea about shoving

431
00:21:34,014 --> 00:21:35,174
broadcast video into games.

432
00:21:35,714 --> 00:21:38,575
But basically, if any video footage

433
00:21:38,595 --> 00:21:41,455
has previously been shown on TV and is then shown digitally,

434
00:21:42,955 --> 00:21:45,676
there is a set of features quite similar to this, which

435
00:21:45,736 --> 00:21:47,696
is actually required by law for the playback.

436
00:21:48,256 --> 00:21:50,517
So that's why if you open up the settings of YouTube,

437
00:21:50,537 --> 00:21:52,517
you open up the settings of Netflix,

438
00:21:53,657 --> 00:21:55,498
you see settings very similar to this.

439
00:21:55,558 --> 00:21:58,218
You also see it within the system options of the Xbox,

440
00:21:58,258 --> 00:22:00,018
PlayStation, iOS, Android.

441
00:22:01,631 --> 00:22:03,312
I don't know if that kind of stuff will come to games someday,

442
00:22:03,672 --> 00:22:07,174
but it's sensible to think about this kind of stuff,

443
00:22:07,335 --> 00:22:08,115
just in case it does.

444
00:22:08,555 --> 00:22:10,256
It's also sensible to think about this kind of stuff

445
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:11,517
because it's good for your players.

446
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:16,981
I think something's worth mentioning when it comes to options,

447
00:22:17,221 --> 00:22:19,422
and this applies to accessibility options in general,

448
00:22:19,842 --> 00:22:20,683
is that the more you add,

449
00:22:21,323 --> 00:22:23,385
that is actually the accessibility barrier in itself,

450
00:22:24,025 --> 00:22:25,946
like navigating, configuring.

451
00:22:26,547 --> 00:22:28,548
It's for some people difficult and confusing.

452
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:33,162
and presets come to the rescue.

453
00:22:34,082 --> 00:22:36,444
So if you are starting to put in lots of configuration options,

454
00:22:36,704 --> 00:22:38,685
just think of it in the same way that you would do with controls.

455
00:22:39,065 --> 00:22:42,467
So like with controls, you might have like default, bumper jumper,

456
00:22:42,948 --> 00:22:44,849
custom, custom lets you do remapping.

457
00:22:45,189 --> 00:22:46,530
Just think of subtitles in the same way.

458
00:22:50,172 --> 00:22:51,673
So I have five minutes left.

459
00:22:51,693 --> 00:22:52,693
Should I talk about VR?

460
00:22:52,773 --> 00:22:54,114
Does anyone want me to talk about VR?

461
00:22:55,215 --> 00:22:55,415
Yeah?

462
00:22:55,655 --> 00:22:55,935
OK.

463
00:22:56,316 --> 00:22:57,356
Right, so VR.

464
00:22:58,297 --> 00:23:00,098
VR presents some interesting issues.

465
00:23:01,068 --> 00:23:03,870
Firstly, because in all other media,

466
00:23:04,571 --> 00:23:07,813
what I was saying about putting the subtitles at the bottom, in the middle,

467
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:09,715
in VR, there is no bottom, there is no screen.

468
00:23:11,016 --> 00:23:14,780
Also, in other media, the subtitles, regardless of what happens within the game,

469
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,383
in the actual physical world, the subtitles are exactly the same depth

470
00:23:18,743 --> 00:23:21,005
as the gameplay footage or the TV footage or anything else.

471
00:23:21,205 --> 00:23:22,627
In VR, that's no longer an issue.

472
00:23:23,087 --> 00:23:24,648
They're actually floating in the virtual space.

473
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:28,312
That results in problems. Where do you put them?

474
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,342
you could have them floating in front of your face

475
00:23:34,782 --> 00:23:37,103
in roughly the same kind of position as they would be

476
00:23:37,163 --> 00:23:38,024
if you were looking at a screen.

477
00:23:39,505 --> 00:23:42,567
That means to avoid occlusion, like my subtitles are here,

478
00:23:42,947 --> 00:23:43,748
I'm in front of the mic,

479
00:23:43,948 --> 00:23:45,829
the mic is now in the middle of the subtitles, right?

480
00:23:45,849 --> 00:23:47,430
So you need to put them really, really close to your face.

481
00:23:48,611 --> 00:23:50,332
That means that the subtitles themselves

482
00:23:50,632 --> 00:23:51,813
and the thing making the noise,

483
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:53,814
there's a big difference in depth between them.

484
00:23:54,775 --> 00:23:55,836
So if you go like this

485
00:23:56,136 --> 00:23:58,197
and focus on your two fingers in front of you,

486
00:23:58,337 --> 00:23:59,558
shift focus near and far,

487
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:01,199
it strains your eyes really quickly.

488
00:24:01,962 --> 00:24:03,323
So you're risking the same thing in VR,

489
00:24:03,363 --> 00:24:05,204
and you really don't want to give people eye strain in VR.

490
00:24:05,464 --> 00:24:07,385
That's a good way to induce simulation sickness.

491
00:24:07,525 --> 00:24:09,927
So that option has problems.

492
00:24:10,947 --> 00:24:11,688
So what else can you do?

493
00:24:12,588 --> 00:24:13,769
Next thing people often think about

494
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,930
is maybe I could attach them to the source of the audio.

495
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:18,831
So if, so where's the speaker?

496
00:24:18,911 --> 00:24:19,232
Here we go.

497
00:24:19,272 --> 00:24:21,313
So the sound from my voice is coming out from that speaker.

498
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:25,055
Physically attach a subtitle to that speaker, which is great.

499
00:24:25,295 --> 00:24:27,596
That the text is at the same depth

500
00:24:27,936 --> 00:24:28,917
as the source of the audio.

501
00:24:29,757 --> 00:24:31,518
Then I turn over here, and I can't see the subtitles

502
00:24:31,578 --> 00:24:31,718
anymore.

503
00:24:33,534 --> 00:24:36,056
So that approach has issues as well.

504
00:24:36,717 --> 00:24:38,699
So that's something that I think there's

505
00:24:38,719 --> 00:24:41,262
going to be a nice solution that has come to.

506
00:24:41,402 --> 00:24:42,423
I don't think we're there yet.

507
00:24:42,883 --> 00:24:45,086
The most promising solution I've seen so far

508
00:24:45,306 --> 00:24:47,668
is a modal approach, something that switches between the two.

509
00:24:48,269 --> 00:24:50,191
So something that's attached to the audio source

510
00:24:50,391 --> 00:24:51,633
when it's within your field of vision.

511
00:24:52,253 --> 00:24:54,355
When you move away, it detaches from that

512
00:24:54,736 --> 00:24:55,937
and snaps into your vision.

513
00:24:56,355 --> 00:24:59,877
you do get that issue with having to focus on something close to you,

514
00:25:00,357 --> 00:25:02,998
but at least if it indicates where it is, you know to then turn back

515
00:25:03,238 --> 00:25:04,579
so it snaps back to the right depth again.

516
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,801
So, like I said, that's like an early approach to it,

517
00:25:09,082 --> 00:25:10,722
but that's something that I think is going to grow and evolve.

518
00:25:10,762 --> 00:25:11,923
But if you want to see that in action,

519
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:15,065
have a look at a game called Virtual Virtual Reality.

520
00:25:15,505 --> 00:25:16,866
That's got an example of that approach in it.

521
00:25:19,947 --> 00:25:21,408
So, I'm going to finish on...

522
00:25:23,869 --> 00:25:25,370
this question, reinventing the wheel.

523
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,520
That's what everybody's doing at the moment.

524
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,081
Every example I've shown you,

525
00:25:30,961 --> 00:25:33,202
these are all bespoke custom-rolled solutions,

526
00:25:35,183 --> 00:25:37,645
despite the approaches being the same across all these different games.

527
00:25:38,185 --> 00:25:40,606
That's wasted work. People shouldn't be repeating this work all the time.

528
00:25:41,226 --> 00:25:44,508
So wouldn't it be nice if there was just a centralized tool

529
00:25:44,548 --> 00:25:45,688
that took care of this stuff for you?

530
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:48,810
Like this.

531
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:51,911
So this is a $20 Unreal plugin.

532
00:25:54,175 --> 00:25:56,536
It includes most of the accommodations

533
00:25:56,556 --> 00:25:57,797
that I've been talking about so far.

534
00:25:58,777 --> 00:26:00,258
It also includes some other ones as well.

535
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:04,500
So things like the, like at the, sorry,

536
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,181
what the appropriate gap is to have in between each subtitle

537
00:26:07,221 --> 00:26:09,042
to avoid simulation sickness from them flicking in.

538
00:26:09,983 --> 00:26:11,984
And so this is available for Unreal.

539
00:26:13,024 --> 00:26:14,745
Plenty of people in the room aren't using Unreal.

540
00:26:15,586 --> 00:26:18,467
On that page, he also links to a free PDF

541
00:26:18,507 --> 00:26:20,608
which details the full specification he built it to.

542
00:26:20,868 --> 00:26:22,509
So you can take that and apply it to your own game as well.

543
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,452
So great, plug-in, $20, low barrier to entry.

544
00:26:27,213 --> 00:26:28,974
But this is not where it needs to be.

545
00:26:31,496 --> 00:26:34,338
This is where it needs to be, built directly into the engines.

546
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:39,001
I mean, saving the $20, that'd be nice,

547
00:26:39,502 --> 00:26:41,563
but the real benefit is that it's on by default.

548
00:26:42,884 --> 00:26:45,786
So if within Unity and Unreal, in particular,

549
00:26:45,886 --> 00:26:47,928
particularly Unity because of so much games,

550
00:26:47,948 --> 00:26:51,130
I'm sure most of the people in the room are aware of what percentage

551
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,591
of games are built in Unity.

552
00:26:53,065 --> 00:26:55,947
Like if Unity had a nice subtitling system baked in

553
00:26:56,267 --> 00:26:57,468
that took care of these requirements,

554
00:26:58,148 --> 00:26:59,429
you would get people who would just be like,

555
00:26:59,449 --> 00:27:00,870
oh, I've got to put subtitles in my game.

556
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,931
Cool, Unity has a system, I'll use it.

557
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:05,032
And then without ever even having thought

558
00:27:05,052 --> 00:27:06,853
about accessibility, they'd have a ton

559
00:27:07,193 --> 00:27:08,114
of good stuff in their game.

560
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:12,036
So that's the thought I want to leave you on,

561
00:27:12,096 --> 00:27:12,877
the call to action.

562
00:27:12,997 --> 00:27:14,498
Please, please, please, if you want your lives

563
00:27:14,518 --> 00:27:17,099
to be easier with subtitling, harass these guys.

564
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:18,200
Get them to do it at engine level.

565
00:27:19,821 --> 00:27:21,041
If Unity and Unreal are in the room,

566
00:27:21,421 --> 00:27:22,522
sorry for getting people to harass you,

567
00:27:22,542 --> 00:27:22,682
but...

568
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:23,579
they kind of should.

569
00:27:26,022 --> 00:27:26,943
So quick summary.

570
00:27:27,203 --> 00:27:29,145
Basics, size, contrast, and amount of text.

571
00:27:29,906 --> 00:27:32,288
Best practices, accurate, comprehension is essential.

572
00:27:32,709 --> 00:27:34,711
Add from the bottom, indicate speakers and direction,

573
00:27:35,291 --> 00:27:36,573
let people have enough time to read them,

574
00:27:37,033 --> 00:27:39,996
use a clear font, offer captions, and offer options.

575
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:41,858
Thank you.
