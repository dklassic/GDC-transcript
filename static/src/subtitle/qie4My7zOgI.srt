00:00:06,613 --> 00:00:08,934
I'm Dan Hudson, and thanks for coming to my talk entitled,

2
00:00:09,034 --> 00:00:10,755
Player-Driven Stories, How Do We Get There?

3
00:00:11,415 --> 00:00:12,375
You'll see a link here.

4
00:00:12,735 --> 00:00:13,796
The slides are already available,

5
00:00:13,816 --> 00:00:15,056
so don't worry about taking pictures

6
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:16,297
or trying to copy everything down.

7
00:00:16,477 --> 00:00:17,558
You can just go to that site.

8
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:19,178
And that link is also on the last slide,

9
00:00:19,238 --> 00:00:20,659
so don't worry about scribbling it now,

10
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:22,400
unless you leave in the middle.

11
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,861
Anyways, about me, real quick.

12
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:26,881
I started my career at Ion Storm Austin,

13
00:00:26,982 --> 00:00:29,763
where I worked on Deus Ex Invisible War, the PS2

14
00:00:29,803 --> 00:00:31,123
version of Deus Ex, and Thief 3.

15
00:00:32,285 --> 00:00:38,126
Then I went to Midway Austin where I worked on a open-world action game that was canceled when Midway started to go under

16
00:00:39,067 --> 00:00:42,887
After that, I moved to 2k Marin up in the North Bay where I worked on Bioshock 2

17
00:00:43,787 --> 00:00:50,509
And the new XCOM project and I recently moved to LucasArts where I'm making a new game with Clint Hocking and Matthias Wortsch

18
00:00:51,589 --> 00:00:56,390
Quick spoiler alert here. Yeah, it's a good picture of him quick spoiler alert here

19
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,410
I am going to discuss some stories in games and if you haven't played these games you might consider these

20
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,312
A spoiler, so those games are Red Dead Redemption, Morrowind,

21
00:01:05,113 --> 00:01:07,275
Deus Ex, Passage, and Portal.

22
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:09,657
There's a little title slide before each of these,

23
00:01:09,697 --> 00:01:11,278
so if you want to close your eyes and cover your ears

24
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:13,099
if you haven't played those games, go for it.

25
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,083
So yeah, quick overview of the talk.

26
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:18,504
First, I'm going to talk about the problem

27
00:01:18,524 --> 00:01:20,285
as I see it with story and games right now,

28
00:01:20,926 --> 00:01:22,627
talk about a goal we should be striving for,

29
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:25,109
some common stumbling blocks in reaching that goal,

30
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,031
look at some possible solutions along with analysis

31
00:01:28,071 --> 00:01:30,553
of how certain games have tackled those types of things.

32
00:01:31,122 --> 00:01:34,085
And finally, of course, some closing thoughts.

33
00:01:34,326 --> 00:01:35,507
So let's jump right in.

34
00:01:36,588 --> 00:01:37,870
The problem that I'm putting forth

35
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,213
is that games really aren't taking advantage

36
00:01:40,253 --> 00:01:42,496
of what makes games games, which is interactivity.

37
00:01:43,197 --> 00:01:45,960
We're often copying these Hollywood linear stories

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,542
and just kind of moving the player from one cut

39
00:01:47,562 --> 00:01:49,845
scene to the next or from one scripted sequence to the next.

40
00:01:50,262 --> 00:01:53,944
and kind of telling these linear stories that frankly would be told better in other mediums.

41
00:01:54,304 --> 00:01:58,145
Whereas in games, we do have the advantage of that interactivity and can be telling games that

42
00:01:58,486 --> 00:02:03,087
are more about, you know, what the player's doing and letting the player actually build and construct those narratives.

43
00:02:03,808 --> 00:02:08,990
The interactive elements of games are often, you know, simple and unengaging when compared to the cutscenes that you find in games.

44
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:13,031
You just shoot a bunch of dudes and then go fall in love in a cutscene and then go back to shoot a bunch of strangers.

45
00:02:13,872 --> 00:02:14,692
So basically right now...

46
00:02:15,153 --> 00:02:16,534
Players aren't driving the story,

47
00:02:16,654 --> 00:02:18,335
even if the character that they're playing is.

48
00:02:18,635 --> 00:02:20,236
And like I said, this is something

49
00:02:20,256 --> 00:02:22,118
that we and our medium have a unique ability

50
00:02:22,158 --> 00:02:24,940
to address because we do have that element of interactivity.

51
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,322
So I'd like us to try to make stories that are a little bit

52
00:02:28,342 --> 00:02:29,443
more specific to our medium.

53
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,085
And the question of what we should be aiming for,

54
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:35,207
the goal I'm putting forth is a story in which the player makes

55
00:02:35,327 --> 00:02:37,729
influential decisions that create a unique narrative

56
00:02:37,869 --> 00:02:39,410
that's not prescribed by a designer.

57
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,451
And I want to call out a couple of words there

58
00:02:41,471 --> 00:02:43,673
that might seem obvious, but the first one is influential.

59
00:02:44,144 --> 00:02:45,946
What that means is that the choices are meaningful.

60
00:02:45,986 --> 00:02:47,087
They're not just short loops.

61
00:02:47,107 --> 00:02:47,948
They're not cosmetic.

62
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,910
They actually fundamentally change where the story is

63
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:50,691
going in the game.

64
00:02:51,432 --> 00:02:53,574
The second one is create, which means that these choices

65
00:02:53,634 --> 00:02:55,356
actually generate new story events.

66
00:02:55,436 --> 00:02:58,179
It's not just choosing linear branches that have been picked

67
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,100
by a designer.

68
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,142
But again, you're creating new story content,

69
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:01,923
new story events.

70
00:03:02,643 --> 00:03:03,845
And finally, the word is narrative.

71
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,884
What this means basically is that we need to be creating

72
00:03:07,064 --> 00:03:09,066
a coherent series of events over time

73
00:03:09,126 --> 00:03:10,807
that hang together as an actual story

74
00:03:10,847 --> 00:03:12,889
as opposed to a bunch of little micro interactions

75
00:03:12,929 --> 00:03:15,270
that don't really have any long-term benefit.

76
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,831
That's what a story is, you know,

77
00:03:17,172 --> 00:03:19,153
long buildups and releases of tension

78
00:03:19,193 --> 00:03:20,434
and blah, blah, blah, all that good stuff.

79
00:03:21,275 --> 00:03:21,895
We'll get to it later.

80
00:03:22,716 --> 00:03:23,016
So yeah.

81
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:28,456
When we try to create stories like this, we need to understand what people strive for.

82
00:03:28,516 --> 00:03:29,676
What do people want in their lives?

83
00:03:29,716 --> 00:03:31,216
And what do people want for happiness?

84
00:03:31,276 --> 00:03:34,597
Because if we are trying to give them worlds in which they can create their own stories,

85
00:03:34,617 --> 00:03:36,257
we have to understand what motivates them.

86
00:03:36,757 --> 00:03:41,778
And so when I started looking for a framework to talk about that, I came upon self-determination

87
00:03:41,818 --> 00:03:46,019
theory, which is basically a theory that's been studied for about 30 or 40 years now.

88
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:50,340
It's been verified independently and borne out again and again in experiments.

89
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,160
And it basically says...

90
00:03:51,735 --> 00:03:54,016
that when people are seeking happiness or well-being,

91
00:03:54,196 --> 00:03:55,777
they're looking for three primary things.

92
00:03:56,257 --> 00:03:59,378
They want autonomy, competence, and relatedness.

93
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,500
To talk about autonomy first, that basically

94
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,661
means being a causal agent within your environment.

95
00:04:05,701 --> 00:04:07,742
It means being able to simply make decisions that matter,

96
00:04:07,782 --> 00:04:09,543
make choices that affect what's around you.

97
00:04:10,604 --> 00:04:12,204
Since that's very similar to a term

98
00:04:12,224 --> 00:04:14,926
that I'm sure we're all more familiar with called agency,

99
00:04:15,226 --> 00:04:16,727
for the purposes of this talk, I'm actually just

100
00:04:16,747 --> 00:04:18,467
going to use the word agency because, again, it's

101
00:04:18,487 --> 00:04:19,408
just a more familiar term.

102
00:04:19,805 --> 00:04:21,346
But they mean equivalent things.

103
00:04:21,486 --> 00:04:23,286
And so just want to call that out at the start.

104
00:04:24,127 --> 00:04:25,707
Competence is exactly what it sounds like.

105
00:04:25,747 --> 00:04:26,727
It's being good at something.

106
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,828
It's being able to have your actions affect your environment

107
00:04:29,848 --> 00:04:30,549
in a positive way.

108
00:04:30,589 --> 00:04:32,589
And that's something games actually do very well,

109
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,529
at least in gameplay.

110
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:36,630
A lot of games are about skill mastery and competition

111
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:37,231
and those things.

112
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,011
But again, it's not something that we really bring

113
00:04:39,051 --> 00:04:40,252
into our stories very often.

114
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,252
And the last one is relatedness, which is simply

115
00:04:43,593 --> 00:04:45,873
the desire to interact with and connect to and develop

116
00:04:45,913 --> 00:04:47,234
relationships with other people.

117
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:48,514
Pretty basic human desire.

118
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,790
Remember these three words because I'm going to be calling back to them a lot during the

119
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,070
talk.

120
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,851
Agency, competence, and relatedness.

121
00:04:55,131 --> 00:04:57,711
It might not come up on the screen, but you'll hear me say them a lot, so try to keep them

122
00:04:57,751 --> 00:04:58,131
in mind.

123
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:02,152
So yeah, with those in mind, let's talk about our original goal again.

124
00:05:02,252 --> 00:05:05,913
I actually wrote this definition for a previous version of the talk where I used a completely

125
00:05:05,953 --> 00:05:08,413
different psychological framework that's not as good as this one.

126
00:05:08,573 --> 00:05:12,374
And it's weird because I had those three words called out last time, and I realized that

127
00:05:12,394 --> 00:05:16,015
this one actually they map better to this new self-determination theory than my old

128
00:05:16,035 --> 00:05:16,175
talk.

129
00:05:16,195 --> 00:05:17,575
So that was kind of a nice little surprise.

130
00:05:18,196 --> 00:05:20,697
The first one, agency, influential decisions, i.e.

131
00:05:20,977 --> 00:05:21,857
what I'm doing matters.

132
00:05:21,897 --> 00:05:23,798
What I'm doing has meaningful change in the environment

133
00:05:23,818 --> 00:05:24,278
that I'm in.

134
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:26,059
The second one is creation.

135
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:28,620
And that maps to competence, which is basically

136
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,501
if I'm good at something, if I'm interacting well

137
00:05:30,521 --> 00:05:32,582
with my environment, that actually creates new events.

138
00:05:32,762 --> 00:05:34,582
That competence that I'm developing as a player

139
00:05:34,963 --> 00:05:36,023
feeds into the story.

140
00:05:36,823 --> 00:05:38,784
And finally, narrative and relatedness.

141
00:05:38,824 --> 00:05:41,705
Stories are about relationships with people and those dynamics

142
00:05:41,725 --> 00:05:43,086
that happen over time.

143
00:05:43,746 --> 00:05:46,107
So we'll go into depth on each one of these.

144
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,948
But we will start with agency.

145
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,003
and specifically the concept of disparate agency, which is kind of where I see a lot

146
00:05:53,063 --> 00:05:56,325
of games going right now where you've got the player who has a pretty limited set of

147
00:05:56,385 --> 00:05:59,987
abilities when compared to what the character he's playing is doing in a story.

148
00:06:00,387 --> 00:06:04,549
And basically, the agency that the player has within the game is actually a subset of

149
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:06,490
the character's agency that he's playing.

150
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:08,752
And so when it comes to the story...

151
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:13,005
It's almost like the story is subtly telling the player who's sitting on his couch with a controller,

152
00:06:13,445 --> 00:06:16,507
you can't do anything that really matters in this world that you're inhabiting right now.

153
00:06:16,547 --> 00:06:19,009
You know, the big stuff, we're saving that for the super sweet scenes,

154
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:21,090
and we're saving that for the cut scenes, and all that kind of stuff like that.

155
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,372
And the stories where you're going to get that compelling content.

156
00:06:24,412 --> 00:06:28,714
And really, your job is to just keep an avatar alive to get to the next trigger, to the next cut scene.

157
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,377
So, that in mind, what should we be striving for?

158
00:06:33,177 --> 00:06:33,857
Pretty simple, right?

159
00:06:34,258 --> 00:06:35,038
Unified agency.

160
00:06:35,118 --> 00:06:38,640
Basically, creating worlds in which the player and the character have all the same.

161
00:06:39,017 --> 00:06:43,620
impacts in which the character and the player can both affect all systems and relationships

162
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,461
in the game, and giving the player agency across all of the game.

163
00:06:47,322 --> 00:06:52,405
We need to get rid of as many player-excluding dynamics and mechanics as we can, and if there's

164
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:55,247
a particular emotion you're trying to put into your game, figure out a way to express

165
00:06:55,287 --> 00:06:56,047
that mechanically.

166
00:06:56,107 --> 00:07:00,170
Don't just think about the next cool cut scene or scripted moment that you're going to try

167
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:03,572
to evoke those emotions with, because you want the player to feel those for himself,

168
00:07:03,672 --> 00:07:06,834
not necessarily watch that character he's playing on the screen experience them.

169
00:07:07,931 --> 00:07:11,252
Player verbs should really affect even the mid and high

170
00:07:11,292 --> 00:07:12,292
level parts of the story.

171
00:07:12,312 --> 00:07:15,133
And the player basically needs to speak the language

172
00:07:15,213 --> 00:07:16,393
of the narrative with his actions.

173
00:07:16,493 --> 00:07:18,134
So let's look at an interesting example

174
00:07:18,154 --> 00:07:20,854
of a game that has done some of this, didn't quite get there,

175
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:22,675
but it had some really interesting things

176
00:07:22,695 --> 00:07:23,195
to talk about.

177
00:07:23,435 --> 00:07:24,295
That game is Morrowind.

178
00:07:25,235 --> 00:07:27,076
It's a game where the player has an incredible amount

179
00:07:27,096 --> 00:07:28,536
of agency across the game, all sorts

180
00:07:28,556 --> 00:07:29,977
of crazy customization and powers

181
00:07:29,997 --> 00:07:30,777
and everything else like that.

182
00:07:31,177 --> 00:07:33,998
And a perfect example is the main quest giver,

183
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:36,378
who I'm going to butcher his name, Caius Cossades, I think.

184
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:39,037
I didn't really listen to how they said it in the game,

185
00:07:39,177 --> 00:07:40,297
because I played this like five years ago,

186
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:42,839
but he's basically the main quest giver in the game,

187
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,960
and he gives you all your objectives and goals

188
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,681
in the early part of the story,

189
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:50,183
and he's the central guy to guide you through the story.

190
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,184
That said, in Morrowind,

191
00:07:52,504 --> 00:07:54,505
you do have a really high level of agency in the world,

192
00:07:54,525 --> 00:07:55,405
and you can kill anyone,

193
00:07:55,485 --> 00:07:57,106
including the main quest giver of the game.

194
00:07:57,426 --> 00:07:58,627
So if you actually kill this guy,

195
00:07:59,127 --> 00:08:01,028
this little message pops up at the bottom of the screen

196
00:08:01,228 --> 00:08:02,229
that's really, really awesome,

197
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:02,709
and it says,

198
00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:06,191
With this character's death, the thread of prophecy is severed.

199
00:08:06,935 --> 00:08:11,479
restore a saved game to restore the weave of fate or persist in the doom world you've created.

200
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:18,044
And it's really cool because this is like an accessibility feature. Like, they're just like,

201
00:08:18,084 --> 00:08:20,746
hey dude, this is your game, this is your world, this is the choice you made.

202
00:08:21,246 --> 00:08:24,208
Just want to let you know you can't finish this story, but if you want to keep playing,

203
00:08:24,228 --> 00:08:27,611
go for it. Like, they didn't make you reload the game, they didn't make them invulnerable,

204
00:08:27,971 --> 00:08:31,414
you know, they didn't make them always, you know, kill you and overpower you. They were like, look,

205
00:08:31,714 --> 00:08:33,815
just letting you know, dude, if you want to keep playing, go for it.

206
00:08:34,835 --> 00:08:38,560
So it's really cool that they allowed that sort of agency within the world.

207
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,446
Unfortunately, the story ultimately couldn't compensate for that level of agency on the

208
00:08:43,466 --> 00:08:47,091
player's part and it did break the main narrative and so you did lose a lot of cool content

209
00:08:47,111 --> 00:08:47,712
going into the game.

210
00:08:48,373 --> 00:08:50,395
But it makes you ask, why didn't they take this further?

211
00:08:51,688 --> 00:08:55,249
Morrowind is actually a game that could have tolerated a lot more variance and more in

212
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:58,550
the narrative because, you know, it's basically got a player with extensive verbs that are

213
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:01,991
mapped very closely to what the, you know, characters in the world it's interacting with

214
00:09:02,031 --> 00:09:02,251
have.

215
00:09:02,271 --> 00:09:06,412
So there's a lot of parity between the player and those other agents in the world.

216
00:09:06,432 --> 00:09:08,132
A lot of customization.

217
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:08,912
There's alliances.

218
00:09:08,952 --> 00:09:11,173
You can be in good or bad with different groups.

219
00:09:11,613 --> 00:09:12,933
You can kind of shape the world around you.

220
00:09:13,294 --> 00:09:14,814
And it's also a game that relies on text.

221
00:09:14,914 --> 00:09:15,234
So it's...

222
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,936
as you can see, relies on text a lot, even in conversations and not a lot of VO.

223
00:09:18,996 --> 00:09:21,777
So it would have been pretty cheap for them to anticipate a lot of this stuff

224
00:09:21,817 --> 00:09:23,917
and let the story react in more robust ways.

225
00:09:24,757 --> 00:09:26,558
So it's a little disappointing they didn't go further with it,

226
00:09:26,598 --> 00:09:29,579
but I at least applaud them for letting you keep playing

227
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,939
and just kind of letting you know what's up,

228
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:33,080
as almost like I said, an accessibility feature.

229
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,181
So killing that guy was really goofy.

230
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:37,841
It wasn't like a sweet cut scene.

231
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:39,622
It was like the combat's actually not that great.

232
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:44,123
Morwen is just kind of chop wood on him for a while and then he falls over and that's kind of it.

233
00:09:44,463 --> 00:09:44,603
But...

234
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:47,065
I don't know that's necessarily a problem.

235
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:49,786
You might ask, why not turn that into a super awesome cut scene

236
00:09:49,846 --> 00:09:51,867
or do whatever instead of just popping up a little text box?

237
00:09:52,447 --> 00:09:54,668
And the thing I realize is that players

238
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,009
are willing to put themselves into an experience

239
00:09:57,049 --> 00:09:58,290
if you give them that level of agency.

240
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,571
And they'll add meaning to systemic interactions

241
00:10:01,311 --> 00:10:02,992
in ways that you didn't anticipate.

242
00:10:03,452 --> 00:10:06,353
And they will accept a huge drop in fidelity

243
00:10:06,393 --> 00:10:07,954
when it comes to allowing them to make

244
00:10:08,014 --> 00:10:09,414
more meaningful decisions in the world.

245
00:10:09,454 --> 00:10:10,795
You don't have to pay everything off

246
00:10:10,835 --> 00:10:14,456
with these super deluxe cut scenes or scripted moments

247
00:10:14,496 --> 00:10:14,857
or whatever.

248
00:10:15,984 --> 00:10:17,786
players will add that meaning themselves.

249
00:10:17,866 --> 00:10:20,128
So hold that thought about agency.

250
00:10:20,268 --> 00:10:21,189
I'm gonna come back to that,

251
00:10:21,229 --> 00:10:22,670
but first I wanna talk a little bit about

252
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:26,134
why I think we haven't been able to deliver as much agency

253
00:10:26,154 --> 00:10:27,175
and why this problem's actually getting

254
00:10:27,195 --> 00:10:28,096
a lot worse recently.

255
00:10:28,816 --> 00:10:31,839
And that issue is the concept of chasing reality.

256
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,502
Oh, Pat's laughing.

257
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:35,382
I'm sorry, dude.

258
00:10:35,763 --> 00:10:37,424
You worked on co-op, not the single player.

259
00:10:37,624 --> 00:10:38,085
It's cool.

260
00:10:38,866 --> 00:10:39,066
Um.

261
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:40,908
Hehehe.

262
00:10:41,894 --> 00:10:43,895
I'm not making fun of Splinter Cell Conviction.

263
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,416
It's actually a really fun, cool game.

264
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,016
I really enjoyed it.

265
00:10:46,336 --> 00:10:50,419
But, in this scene at the very beginning of the game, you're basically interrogating

266
00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:51,059
this guy in the bathroom.

267
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:53,200
And if you look, the fidelity of this scene is amazing.

268
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,000
It is phenomenal.

269
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,222
You can crash his head into the mirror and it breaks the sink.

270
00:10:57,262 --> 00:11:00,083
If you crash him through the stall door, there's a guy in there taking a dump and he's like,

271
00:11:00,164 --> 00:11:00,884
ah, get out of here, dude.

272
00:11:01,004 --> 00:11:02,585
And like, there's all kinds of stuff that happens.

273
00:11:03,345 --> 00:11:06,547
But the thing I realized, it kind of made me depressed when I was playing that because

274
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:09,188
I was like, man, it took so much work to do this.

275
00:11:09,908 --> 00:11:10,969
And it means there's one outcome.

276
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:17,064
Because when you start to, you know, have this arms race of fidelity that games are getting into, at least in the AAA space,

277
00:11:18,384 --> 00:11:23,027
it just gets more and more expensive to create the same sort of story content as we were creating, you know, five years ago.

278
00:11:23,487 --> 00:11:27,450
And it ultimately is really limiting agency because the more expensive it is to do one thing,

279
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,933
it means that you're less likely to do two or three or four different options in a given story scene.

280
00:11:32,413 --> 00:11:37,796
And even branching stories, you know, in something like a Mass Effect, even those are limited by manpower.

281
00:11:37,896 --> 00:11:40,818
How much, how many of these, you know, discrete branches can we make?

282
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:47,141
So, you know, and branching isn't really true agency. You're still choosing from a number of linear paths. So, ultimately,

283
00:11:48,162 --> 00:11:52,004
it's, you know, troubling to me because as fidelity goes up, agency basically goes down.

284
00:11:52,964 --> 00:11:56,926
And the question is, do we really need this level of fidelity and this level of, you know,

285
00:11:57,146 --> 00:12:01,048
we do need higher agency, but do we need this level of fidelity to create emotionally compelling content?

286
00:12:01,668 --> 00:12:07,872
And I'd say no, because like I mentioned before, players are willing to trade off a significant amount of fidelity to, you know,

287
00:12:08,704 --> 00:12:11,826
have more agency in the game and feel like that world is reacting to them a little bit

288
00:12:11,866 --> 00:12:12,046
more.

289
00:12:12,587 --> 00:12:16,070
So let's break down what goes into a scene like that and see if we can find some solutions

290
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,811
on how to do this stuff a little bit more smartly.

291
00:12:18,211 --> 00:12:20,613
So I'm using the word cutscene here, by the way.

292
00:12:20,693 --> 00:12:24,877
It's just a handy shorthand, but please don't think that I'm just ranting against cutscenes

293
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:25,397
in this talk.

294
00:12:25,717 --> 00:12:30,481
This also goes for any sort of really scripted, you know, objective design or the kind of

295
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,284
game where you're just moving from trigger to trigger and watching stuff happen and just

296
00:12:33,304 --> 00:12:34,385
moving along a linear path.

297
00:12:34,745 --> 00:12:35,946
All that stuff falls under this.

298
00:12:36,026 --> 00:12:37,887
It's just cutscenes are sort of the most...

299
00:12:39,082 --> 00:12:43,906
you know, dramatic example of you putting the controller down just watching and having literally no agency.

300
00:12:43,966 --> 00:12:46,328
So that's just shorthand here.

301
00:12:46,388 --> 00:12:48,450
But anyways, we look at what goes into this.

302
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:54,676
We've got, you know, obviously VO, custom writing, environments, modeling, and animation.

303
00:12:54,776 --> 00:12:55,837
You know, pretty high-level breakdown.

304
00:12:55,877 --> 00:12:57,078
No need to explain too much here.

305
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:05,625
But let's take a look at, you know, how far you can go when you start to strip these elements away and still create an emotional experience.

306
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:11,271
This is the game Passage, which is, I don't know, I'm sure if Hans has played this, anybody played Passage?

307
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:14,972
Oh my gosh, it's awesome, I love you all.

308
00:13:15,693 --> 00:13:20,155
So this is a really sweet game, it's really awesome, it's a five minute game about life,

309
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:26,378
and to me, personally, I can only speak for myself, it was more emotionally compelling than Mass Effect, Alan Wake, all these big story games.

310
00:13:26,838 --> 00:13:29,919
I liked both of those games a whole lot, so I'm not making fun of them again.

311
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:33,681
But the important thing about Passage is it's super simple, super low fidelity.

312
00:13:34,202 --> 00:13:36,003
and the mechanics in the presentation

313
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:38,525
actually define the story in some really interesting ways.

314
00:13:38,966 --> 00:13:40,867
So I'll do like a quick run through here.

315
00:13:41,408 --> 00:13:42,488
Basically, it's a game about life.

316
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:43,669
You're this little dude on the left,

317
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:46,131
and you start on the left, and your only verb is movement.

318
00:13:47,252 --> 00:13:48,513
I'm really glad they put this on the iPhone,

319
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:50,715
because the little D-pad makes it easier to talk about this.

320
00:13:51,382 --> 00:13:54,844
uh... movements your only for and that's how you make choices and your fidelity

321
00:13:54,884 --> 00:13:57,326
is low enough to the mechanics in this game are the story

322
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,968
so you start on the left and you start to move across the screen you know going

323
00:14:00,988 --> 00:14:02,349
to your life and time passes

324
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:05,450
and they do a couple clever things here for example if you notice on the right

325
00:14:05,491 --> 00:14:07,252
side of the screen it's really garbled and blurry

326
00:14:07,872 --> 00:14:11,214
that's the future and the further out the future gets the less certain it is

327
00:14:11,234 --> 00:14:14,216
and you don't know we're gonna be in twenty years and and it's a very simple

328
00:14:14,256 --> 00:14:17,517
mechanical representation of that that you just you bracket instantly playing

329
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:18,718
like oh yeah

330
00:14:19,178 --> 00:14:20,199
you start walking to the world

331
00:14:21,017 --> 00:14:25,739
And you meet a girl, you get a little closer to her, and you just walk up to her and fall

332
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:26,099
in love.

333
00:14:26,439 --> 00:14:29,000
Movement's the only verb, you simply express that intent very simply.

334
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,120
I want to fall in love with her.

335
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,262
By the way, a little callback to relatedness, one of our friends from the self-determination

336
00:14:34,302 --> 00:14:34,542
theory.

337
00:14:35,002 --> 00:14:39,423
So, you meet up with this girl, you join forces, and you start to move through life together.

338
00:14:40,164 --> 00:14:42,845
And as you notice, as you move through life, you start to move from the left side of the

339
00:14:42,885 --> 00:14:45,025
screen to the right side, sort of demonstrating.

340
00:14:45,486 --> 00:14:47,847
This is moving through my own timeline.

341
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,168
And you notice that the future and the past

342
00:14:50,188 --> 00:14:51,808
start to become both kind of blurry.

343
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:55,370
Because as you get in the future and have less life,

344
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,930
you know kind of more what's coming.

345
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,471
And the past and the memories start to fade.

346
00:14:59,491 --> 00:15:00,672
And there's a number at the top that

347
00:15:00,712 --> 00:15:02,853
starts to increment and show your age and stuff like that.

348
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,873
And you start to move through life and get old.

349
00:15:04,893 --> 00:15:05,654
And you get even older.

350
00:15:05,694 --> 00:15:06,554
Your hair falls out.

351
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,474
Your hair turns gray.

352
00:15:07,514 --> 00:15:09,135
And you guys are sort of an elderly couple

353
00:15:09,195 --> 00:15:09,875
moving through life.

354
00:15:10,155 --> 00:15:11,596
And again, this is simply movement,

355
00:15:11,936 --> 00:15:13,717
just moving these guys across the screen slowly

356
00:15:13,737 --> 00:15:14,897
and watching these changes happen.

357
00:15:15,298 --> 00:15:16,798
There's no VO, there's no anything else.

358
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:20,279
And then one of the saddest things in a video game ever happens,

359
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:21,539
she passes away.

360
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:23,880
And you turn into this sad old man,

361
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,940
who's got no hair,

362
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,240
and they do a really, really powerful thing.

363
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,301
They simply reduce your movement speed.

364
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:32,862
So at the very end of the game, you just start moving half as fast.

365
00:15:33,382 --> 00:15:34,762
And you don't need to see the guy cry,

366
00:15:34,802 --> 00:15:36,162
you don't need to have a message on the screen,

367
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:37,062
you don't need VO.

368
00:15:37,963 --> 00:15:39,563
You can just tell, he's moving half as fast.

369
00:15:39,603 --> 00:15:40,703
He has nothing to live for.

370
00:15:40,763 --> 00:15:41,923
He's this guy at the end of his life,

371
00:15:42,404 --> 00:15:43,644
the love of his life has died,

372
00:15:43,684 --> 00:15:44,624
who's been through this whole...

373
00:15:45,055 --> 00:15:48,016
you know, life experience with, and you start going through life alone.

374
00:15:48,696 --> 00:15:53,137
And that tombstone moves into the blurry past with everything else that's gone and you get

375
00:15:53,177 --> 00:15:55,078
to the end of the screen and you die.

376
00:15:55,218 --> 00:15:56,138
And that's the whole game.

377
00:15:56,978 --> 00:15:58,259
And it's incredibly powerful.

378
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:02,600
When you play it, you know, the simplicity of it and the simple verbs of simply moving

379
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,581
through the world, it makes you think about these things.

380
00:16:04,601 --> 00:16:07,821
You're looking at the screen and you're thinking about your own life and your own relationships

381
00:16:07,861 --> 00:16:08,682
and your own friendships.

382
00:16:09,242 --> 00:16:10,002
And it's amazing.

383
00:16:10,362 --> 00:16:12,043
But another really cool thing about it is...

384
00:16:13,023 --> 00:16:15,284
Again, movement is your only, you know, verb here.

385
00:16:15,504 --> 00:16:17,365
And if you start the game over or start a new game,

386
00:16:17,405 --> 00:16:18,445
and you walk up to the girl and you say,

387
00:16:18,465 --> 00:16:19,606
you know what? I'm gonna go it alone.

388
00:16:20,086 --> 00:16:20,906
You just walk around her.

389
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:22,787
You just don't walk up to her.

390
00:16:23,227 --> 00:16:24,628
And you can start to go through life yourself.

391
00:16:25,148 --> 00:16:26,289
And the same kind of thing happens.

392
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:28,049
You move from the left side to the right side,

393
00:16:28,109 --> 00:16:30,631
and the future gets more and more sharply focused,

394
00:16:30,671 --> 00:16:32,251
and the past fades into memory,

395
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,532
your hair falls out, you get old.

396
00:16:34,532 --> 00:16:36,293
And then you die at like half the age.

397
00:16:36,553 --> 00:16:37,654
You don't turn into the old man,

398
00:16:37,794 --> 00:16:38,574
you don't slow down,

399
00:16:38,634 --> 00:16:40,735
you simply go, go, go alone and die.

400
00:16:42,241 --> 00:16:43,261
And it's really, really sad.

401
00:16:43,361 --> 00:16:46,043
And you don't kind of have to explain how profound that is

402
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,423
and what the implication is there.

403
00:16:48,704 --> 00:16:52,106
It's just a really simple way to express these complex emotions

404
00:16:52,126 --> 00:16:52,986
that come with living life.

405
00:16:53,086 --> 00:16:54,327
And it's a very, very powerful game.

406
00:16:54,367 --> 00:16:55,107
I'd encourage you to play it.

407
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,768
It's on every platform imaginable.

408
00:16:58,228 --> 00:16:59,829
So let's quantify a passage real quickly

409
00:16:59,869 --> 00:17:01,130
against those elements we talked about.

410
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,810
VO, there's none.

411
00:17:03,871 --> 00:17:05,272
Custom writing, there's none.

412
00:17:06,012 --> 00:17:08,353
Modeling, by my count, there are five models.

413
00:17:08,393 --> 00:17:10,134
There's the man, the woman, the middle-aged man,

414
00:17:10,194 --> 00:17:11,414
the old man, and the tombstone.

415
00:17:11,675 --> 00:17:11,915
I'm going to.

416
00:17:12,251 --> 00:17:13,611
be generous and call the tombstone a model.

417
00:17:14,631 --> 00:17:17,912
Animation, there's three by my count, the man, the woman,

418
00:17:17,972 --> 00:17:18,532
and the old man.

419
00:17:18,892 --> 00:17:21,073
And the environments, obviously, are at a very low level

420
00:17:21,093 --> 00:17:21,573
of fidelity.

421
00:17:22,113 --> 00:17:23,573
Now, I'm not sitting here contending and saying

422
00:17:23,613 --> 00:17:25,994
that Passage is a reasonable AAA game that you could put

423
00:17:26,014 --> 00:17:27,114
in a box and sell for $60.

424
00:17:27,834 --> 00:17:30,295
But I did want to demonstrate that you can really move players

425
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,355
with a very low level of fidelity

426
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,596
if you're trading off and giving them agency

427
00:17:34,676 --> 00:17:37,337
and allowing them to fully inhabit that experience,

428
00:17:37,377 --> 00:17:39,877
as opposed to watching a scripted series of events.

429
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:46,443
Let's move back to the AAA discussion and free these elements from cut scenes or scripted moments or whatever you want to call them

430
00:17:46,703 --> 00:17:49,944
and consider them one by one and see if there's things we can do to use them more efficiently.

431
00:17:49,984 --> 00:17:53,605
Because ultimately the goal should be, let's take all the things at our disposal, you know,

432
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:59,706
really good VO and really good writing and really cool environments and all these wonderful things that we have at our disposal now.

433
00:17:59,766 --> 00:18:04,567
Let's think about how we can use them more efficiently so that we can enable more agency for players

434
00:18:04,987 --> 00:18:08,988
and create a larger possibility space and create worlds that can react to players a little bit better.

435
00:18:09,168 --> 00:18:09,288
So...

436
00:18:10,278 --> 00:18:11,318
First one up is VO.

437
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,299
Basically, isolate it if you can.

438
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:15,980
Just because you want to have VO in the game

439
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,580
doesn't mean that you have to also have a really sweet lip

440
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,201
syncing model, and animations, and cool cut scenes,

441
00:18:21,261 --> 00:18:22,862
and cool camera angles, and all that stuff like that.

442
00:18:23,222 --> 00:18:25,543
There are ways to just simply put the VO into the world

443
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:26,743
without all those attendant costs.

444
00:18:26,843 --> 00:18:28,303
Lots of games do that kind of thing.

445
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:32,165
AAA games, data links in Deus Ex, or radios in Bioshock,

446
00:18:32,965 --> 00:18:34,525
the voice coming over the speakers in Portal.

447
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:39,599
Don't, you know, as you consider these things, don't assume that you have to do it to the fullest degree.

448
00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:41,860
Think about clever ways to get more in the world.

449
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:47,481
Because if you do it for cheaper, you can do more of it and you can react to more different, you know, scenarios from the player.

450
00:18:47,981 --> 00:18:48,581
Custom writing.

451
00:18:49,141 --> 00:18:53,262
If you can systematize that writing a little bit and sort of make it react to a little bit more generic of events,

452
00:18:53,322 --> 00:18:57,743
and I don't mean make the writing generic and sucky, you know, still have lots of flavor and cool characters and all that,

453
00:18:57,863 --> 00:19:02,123
but basically just make it to where it can react to a series of events, you know.

454
00:19:02,526 --> 00:19:06,228
character is mad at you, character is happy, character is pleased, character is confused,

455
00:19:06,328 --> 00:19:10,890
stuff like that. That might seem a little bit egregious at first because you want to

456
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:14,612
have every scene crafted and, you know, have this awesome, awesome dialogue for every possible

457
00:19:14,632 --> 00:19:18,273
thing that could happen. But, again, players, if they feel like the game is reacting to

458
00:19:18,313 --> 00:19:22,175
what they're doing, they will accept a much lower level of fidelity. And if they simply

459
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:25,257
feel like the game noticed what they did, they're not going to say, oh, that sounds

460
00:19:25,277 --> 00:19:29,919
like a generic response. I remember playing System Shock 2, it was pretty clear that they

461
00:19:29,979 --> 00:19:30,139
had

462
00:19:30,741 --> 00:19:34,022
three or four generic lines of Shodan saying,

463
00:19:34,302 --> 00:19:35,422
I've uploaded some modules.

464
00:19:35,663 --> 00:19:37,723
Good job for when you would complete an objective.

465
00:19:37,763 --> 00:19:39,764
And you heard the same lines over and over in the game.

466
00:19:40,544 --> 00:19:42,345
But it always happened whenever you did something cool

467
00:19:42,365 --> 00:19:43,685
that you felt you should be rewarded for.

468
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:44,705
And so you never were like, ah, they're

469
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:45,666
using that stupid line again.

470
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:46,746
You're like, sweet, yeah.

471
00:19:46,946 --> 00:19:47,506
Like, they noticed.

472
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:48,286
Awesome.

473
00:19:48,547 --> 00:19:49,287
It's a good feeling.

474
00:19:50,487 --> 00:19:53,148
So try to systematize your writing where you can,

475
00:19:53,168 --> 00:19:54,328
which, of course, frees up your VO.

476
00:19:55,334 --> 00:19:57,617
and also try to isolate the writing as well.

477
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:01,361
Just because you wrote something cool doesn't necessarily mean you have to have it voice

478
00:20:01,481 --> 00:20:04,765
acted and presented on a model and animated and lip synced and all that stuff like that.

479
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:09,631
There's lots of games right now that are doing things that are really interesting with sort

480
00:20:09,651 --> 00:20:10,071
of making

481
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,271
your writing stand on its own.

482
00:20:12,351 --> 00:20:15,412
So you can have games like Costume Quest and Stacking,

483
00:20:15,432 --> 00:20:17,493
which are two really cool games on Xbox Live right now.

484
00:20:18,053 --> 00:20:19,633
They've got little, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr,

485
00:20:19,733 --> 00:20:21,454
when people talk, and they just put text on the screen.

486
00:20:21,614 --> 00:20:23,334
And if you can just afford to put text on the screen,

487
00:20:23,595 --> 00:20:24,695
that lets you do a lot more of it

488
00:20:25,115 --> 00:20:28,556
and make stuff that really reacts to more situations.

489
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,457
You can also use Simlish, like The Sims had,

490
00:20:31,657 --> 00:20:34,618
or this might be a stupid example, but whatever.

491
00:20:35,898 --> 00:20:37,679
Voice synthesis, you know, like people are like,

492
00:20:37,699 --> 00:20:38,419
oh, it's not good enough.

493
00:20:38,479 --> 00:20:39,660
It's not believable as human characters.

494
00:20:40,088 --> 00:20:42,409
then don't make a game where it's coming from human characters.

495
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,350
Like, make robots or something, or make computers that talk.

496
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,371
Because it would sound OK for that, because it sounds like a computer.

497
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:50,333
So like, you know, think about how you can extend your writing

498
00:20:50,353 --> 00:20:52,894
and make it to where you can get more in the game for cheaper costs.

499
00:20:53,714 --> 00:20:56,536
For environments, try to reuse where you can.

500
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:58,597
There's sort of two reasons for this.

501
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:01,258
If you can use gameplay spaces for your story scenes

502
00:21:01,298 --> 00:21:02,118
and allow the story to...

503
00:21:02,612 --> 00:21:06,954
occur in spaces that players are inhabiting otherwise in gameplay, then number one, you

504
00:21:07,094 --> 00:21:10,476
just have more real estate and you have more time to simply build more game environments

505
00:21:10,516 --> 00:21:12,358
for playing the game, which is great.

506
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:18,221
But also, a lot of times games will have sort of hero scenes, you know, not about heroes,

507
00:21:18,301 --> 00:21:21,783
but sort of like really sweet looking environments that are really carefully crafted for story

508
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:22,063
events.

509
00:21:22,404 --> 00:21:25,626
And players can tell in the back of their minds that the fidelity of those areas is

510
00:21:25,726 --> 00:21:26,006
higher.

511
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,682
And it's a subtle way, again, of the game saying, hey,

512
00:21:29,702 --> 00:21:31,084
the story's where the really cool stuff happens.

513
00:21:31,104 --> 00:21:34,647
We built a special, sweet penthouse with a helicopter

514
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:35,448
outside of it or whatever.

515
00:21:35,908 --> 00:21:37,189
And that's where it's going to happen.

516
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,471
And it's a little subtle diss to the player, again,

517
00:21:39,511 --> 00:21:41,253
saying that the story's important, you're not.

518
00:21:41,673 --> 00:21:43,675
So if you can reuse those spaces and just

519
00:21:43,715 --> 00:21:46,698
be sort of cost-conscious with it, then, again,

520
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:50,782
you have more opportunities to allow for more agency

521
00:21:50,822 --> 00:21:51,482
on the player's part.

522
00:21:52,804 --> 00:21:53,164
Next one.

523
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,882
Modeling, basically just use some restraint here.

524
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:59,184
Don't model story-only characters that only exist in cut scenes,

525
00:21:59,224 --> 00:22:01,266
because that's a pretty poor use of resources.

526
00:22:01,306 --> 00:22:04,088
Either try to figure out how those characters can be in the gameplay

527
00:22:04,328 --> 00:22:08,591
and take part in that world that allows the player to have unified agency,

528
00:22:08,971 --> 00:22:11,633
or find other ways, again, for that story character to communicate.

529
00:22:11,693 --> 00:22:13,294
Maybe they are calling you over a radio.

530
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,212
Maybe they're emailing you.

531
00:22:15,553 --> 00:22:17,395
Reading emails is a really fun thing to do in games.

532
00:22:18,577 --> 00:22:21,260
Do comic book style cut scenes so that you can use a pretty

533
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,043
cheap drawing of them as opposed to 3D.

534
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:26,627
But again, think about how if your intent is this character

535
00:22:26,667 --> 00:22:28,450
says this, don't just immediately assume, OK, then

536
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:30,092
we've got to build out the huge Excel sheet of all the

537
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,055
dependencies that go into creating a huge character.

538
00:22:32,383 --> 00:22:34,264
Think about clever ways to have people communicate.

539
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:35,825
And that doesn't even have to be VO.

540
00:22:35,985 --> 00:22:37,465
I'll talk about some examples of that in a little bit.

541
00:22:38,186 --> 00:22:40,527
And animation, pretty much hand-in-hand with modeling.

542
00:22:40,907 --> 00:22:42,908
The less models that you have to animate in those scenes,

543
00:22:42,968 --> 00:22:44,228
then the more animation you can do

544
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:46,789
for just making your gameplay better, which we make games,

545
00:22:46,829 --> 00:22:47,409
so that's cool.

546
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:51,031
So when you look at all these individual elements,

547
00:22:52,551 --> 00:22:54,612
try to use them separately and or efficiently,

548
00:22:55,132 --> 00:22:57,073
and ultimately use them in ways that

549
00:22:57,093 --> 00:22:58,213
give the player more agency.

550
00:22:58,834 --> 00:22:59,714
But the key thing is this.

551
00:23:01,077 --> 00:23:01,838
own your choices.

552
00:23:02,318 --> 00:23:05,681
Like, don't look at how you can be cheap and scramp and be like,

553
00:23:05,741 --> 00:23:07,943
ah, the animation doesn't have to be that good for the scene, or,

554
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:09,844
you know, maybe we can get away without lip syncing.

555
00:23:10,385 --> 00:23:13,007
Because players will definitely recognize if you're trying to do a cheap version

556
00:23:13,127 --> 00:23:14,949
of something that's done really well in like, you know,

557
00:23:15,109 --> 00:23:17,671
Call of Duty or some like really high polish, high fidelity game.

558
00:23:18,411 --> 00:23:20,994
They will recognize that and they will think you're cheap and they will know it.

559
00:23:21,414 --> 00:23:22,995
So, instead of doing that, find...

560
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:29,136
a version of, you know, a cheaper storytelling method that you can own and really make cool.

561
00:23:29,877 --> 00:23:33,817
Here's an example of that from Infamous, which is a, this is from the beginning of the game

562
00:23:33,837 --> 00:23:36,978
so it's not really a spoiler, but they basically had a really cool style for their cut scenes,

563
00:23:37,178 --> 00:23:38,078
so I'll show that here.

564
00:23:41,999 --> 00:23:49,380
While sliding into unconsciousness, I can somehow, I don't know, hear the voices of

565
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:49,900
the dying.

566
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,484
Thousands crushed by falling buildings burned alive in the fires.

567
00:23:57,205 --> 00:23:59,888
Trish lost her sister. Homeless lost me.

568
00:24:00,489 --> 00:24:06,094
Zeke was always there, somehow sure that I'd wake up while outside the city he fell apart.

569
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,061
So they gave you a lot of information in that scene.

570
00:24:10,562 --> 00:24:11,582
They established the timeline.

571
00:24:11,603 --> 00:24:12,663
This is the beginning of the game.

572
00:24:13,424 --> 00:24:15,185
The hero, he's unconscious, and he's apparently

573
00:24:15,225 --> 00:24:17,387
been affected with some weird electrical powers.

574
00:24:18,068 --> 00:24:20,129
There's people being killed and burned out in the city.

575
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:21,651
There's all these disasters going on.

576
00:24:22,131 --> 00:24:24,473
The player's got a girlfriend named Trish, whose sister died.

577
00:24:24,953 --> 00:24:28,336
The hero has almost died, and he's on death's door.

578
00:24:28,816 --> 00:24:30,238
And he has this loyal friend named

579
00:24:30,258 --> 00:24:32,139
Zeke, who's sure that he's going to come back to life.

580
00:24:32,439 --> 00:24:35,682
They got that across in like 15 seconds with, uh,

581
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:40,143
2D art, really, really stylish, but more importantly, they owned that style.

582
00:24:40,244 --> 00:24:42,245
They said, we're going to do something that's cheaper.

583
00:24:42,445 --> 00:24:45,007
The VO was completely isolated. There was no 3D modeling.

584
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:48,190
There was no animation, da-da-da, you know, long list of stuff.

585
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:52,993
They isolated the VO, used it as a voiceover, used this really cool 2D hand-drawn style.

586
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:54,975
And when I saw that as a player, when I popped that disc in,

587
00:24:55,255 --> 00:24:56,976
I was like, wow, that's really neat. That's interesting.

588
00:24:57,016 --> 00:24:59,178
I really like this game. It did something different. You know what I'm saying?

589
00:25:00,543 --> 00:25:03,164
they embraced it as opposed to just trying to find a cheap way out.

590
00:25:03,244 --> 00:25:06,924
So please keep that in mind, because I'm not saying just like, try to, you know, pinch those pennies.

591
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:11,346
I'm saying simply consider where your, you know, development resources are going.

592
00:25:11,366 --> 00:25:16,187
And if there's ways you can do stuff in really cheap, but also really cool ways, then go for it.

593
00:25:16,867 --> 00:25:18,207
Another game that did this was Portal.

594
00:25:18,527 --> 00:25:20,608
Used a lot of those similar things I talked about.

595
00:25:21,248 --> 00:25:25,189
The voice, you know, from the antagonist character simply comes over loudspeakers in the environment,

596
00:25:25,209 --> 00:25:29,610
so they can very quickly write and record stuff and just play it to the player through a, you know, convention.

597
00:25:30,448 --> 00:25:31,449
that's established in the world.

598
00:25:31,809 --> 00:25:33,809
And they also have a lot of environmental storytelling,

599
00:25:33,889 --> 00:25:36,250
where instead of having to create all these scenes,

600
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,490
animate them, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

601
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:39,370
you come across the remnants of things

602
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,131
that have happened in the past that are static scenes.

603
00:25:41,631 --> 00:25:43,271
And it's actually more engaging for the player,

604
00:25:43,311 --> 00:25:44,591
because you're trying to solve a mystery,

605
00:25:44,611 --> 00:25:46,372
and you're trying to puzzle together what's going on.

606
00:25:46,412 --> 00:25:46,652
You know?

607
00:25:46,672 --> 00:25:47,892
There's this little crack in the wall.

608
00:25:47,972 --> 00:25:48,832
Ooh, what's back there?

609
00:25:48,872 --> 00:25:49,813
It's actually engaging.

610
00:25:49,873 --> 00:25:51,533
It's not, you don't sit there thinking,

611
00:25:51,573 --> 00:25:52,993
like, man, I really would have wished

612
00:25:53,033 --> 00:25:54,193
I'd seen the soldier kill that guy.

613
00:25:54,213 --> 00:25:55,434
You're like, wow, what happened here?

614
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:55,794
You know?

615
00:25:56,094 --> 00:25:57,274
It's actually cool.

616
00:25:57,494 --> 00:25:58,534
It makes it more engaging.

617
00:25:58,794 --> 00:25:59,975
But it's also very economical.

618
00:26:02,393 --> 00:26:03,693
And that's just the storytelling methods.

619
00:26:03,733 --> 00:26:05,174
But another thing I want to get back to

620
00:26:05,194 --> 00:26:07,515
is that we've sort of left competence behind

621
00:26:07,615 --> 00:26:09,156
from that self-determination theory.

622
00:26:09,896 --> 00:26:11,237
And so I want to talk about that a little bit.

623
00:26:12,098 --> 00:26:14,399
Basically, the gameplay of Portal

624
00:26:14,859 --> 00:26:17,560
was defeating these really cool geographical puzzles.

625
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,261
Like you're trying to figure out how do I get from one side

626
00:26:19,281 --> 00:26:19,641
to the other.

627
00:26:20,001 --> 00:26:21,342
And you're always constantly thinking

628
00:26:21,662 --> 00:26:25,364
in terms of geometry, geography, and your own abilities,

629
00:26:25,924 --> 00:26:28,025
and how you can defeat each of these test chambers.

630
00:26:28,445 --> 00:26:29,466
And the story of the game.

631
00:26:30,203 --> 00:26:32,906
is thinking about how you can use your abilities to escape this facility.

632
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,929
It's a macro version of what you're doing in every level of the game.

633
00:26:35,949 --> 00:26:38,231
So the micro and the macro were unified.

634
00:26:38,391 --> 00:26:41,114
What you were doing moment to moment, second to second as a player

635
00:26:41,575 --> 00:26:43,997
was directly in line with your motivations as a character.

636
00:26:44,057 --> 00:26:46,039
And those, you know, they never broke from first person.

637
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:50,303
They never, you know, tried to inject story stuff that didn't fit with that motif.

638
00:26:50,664 --> 00:26:53,166
And basically you felt like what I'm doing every second.

639
00:26:54,394 --> 00:26:57,395
goes along with what's going on in the world and what my story is.

640
00:26:57,475 --> 00:27:01,937
So a really nice way to allow the player's competence, the player's skill as they're

641
00:27:01,957 --> 00:27:04,038
playing through the game to contribute directly to the narrative.

642
00:27:05,858 --> 00:27:09,880
Another scene is the companion cube, which if you haven't played, you basically have

643
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,742
this special cube that you've got to, you know, the game's all about taking these cubes

644
00:27:13,782 --> 00:27:16,142
and putting them on different switches to make doors open and stuff like that.

645
00:27:16,483 --> 00:27:19,564
And there's a particular level where you have this cube that has a heart on it.

646
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:23,604
uh... the you know disembodied voice over the speakers tells you it's your

647
00:27:23,664 --> 00:27:27,226
weighted companion cube. And you're like, oh what's this? And so you go through the whole level and it's one of the

648
00:27:27,266 --> 00:27:28,946
longer more complex levels in the game

649
00:27:29,427 --> 00:27:30,127
and you grow that you

650
00:27:30,647 --> 00:27:32,868
create like an actual legitimate attachment to this

651
00:27:33,969 --> 00:27:38,331
box this with a heart on it like it that there there's not that's it like there's

652
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:40,992
you don't need a video that's that's the companion cube

653
00:27:41,512 --> 00:27:43,213
and at the end of the level

654
00:27:43,633 --> 00:27:46,615
there's a twist where the uh... disembodied voice makes you kill your

655
00:27:46,635 --> 00:27:47,395
companion cube

656
00:27:47,655 --> 00:27:49,756
and it's the only way to proceed and like gamers like

657
00:27:51,925 --> 00:27:54,046
you know, you're looking like, ah, I can't, mm.

658
00:27:54,566 --> 00:27:55,847
And it's a box.

659
00:27:56,807 --> 00:28:00,609
So, but it's really great because they

660
00:28:00,669 --> 00:28:02,610
use really economical storytelling devices.

661
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:05,591
And, you know, it again, it used the core verbs.

662
00:28:05,791 --> 00:28:08,192
It's the player picking up, putting down, solving puzzles.

663
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:09,953
All of that stuff was completely unified,

664
00:28:09,993 --> 00:28:11,313
and yet it was a really powerful moment.

665
00:28:11,714 --> 00:28:14,635
Now, it's not a perfect example of a player-driven story,

666
00:28:14,675 --> 00:28:16,275
which I'll get back to that concept, I promise.

667
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,956
It's not a perfect example of a player-driven story

668
00:28:18,977 --> 00:28:20,537
because ultimately there was only one outcome.

669
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,602
But it does ask the question, would it

670
00:28:23,642 --> 00:28:25,463
have been more expensive, that much more expensive,

671
00:28:25,483 --> 00:28:27,924
for them to allow for more possibilities in that story?

672
00:28:28,444 --> 00:28:31,846
It really wouldn't be, because again, it's disembodied VO.

673
00:28:31,926 --> 00:28:33,027
It's simple player verbs.

674
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:34,168
It's a static object.

675
00:28:35,848 --> 00:28:37,469
It's not that I'm knocking Valve for not doing that,

676
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:39,871
because Portal is a beautiful game in every sense.

677
00:28:40,591 --> 00:28:43,533
And systemic story just simply wasn't a priority for them

678
00:28:43,573 --> 00:28:44,113
on the project.

679
00:28:44,233 --> 00:28:46,674
But it does demonstrate interesting possibilities.

680
00:28:46,835 --> 00:28:49,956
Again, it's a AAA game by one of the best publishers

681
00:28:49,976 --> 00:28:50,497
in the industry.

682
00:28:50,805 --> 00:28:54,306
or developers in the industry, sorry,

683
00:28:54,326 --> 00:28:55,627
and used some very simple devices

684
00:28:55,647 --> 00:28:57,447
to make a very cool scene happen.

685
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:58,607
So again, keep that in mind.

686
00:28:58,647 --> 00:28:59,748
There are ways to do this where you

687
00:28:59,788 --> 00:29:02,708
don't have to talk about writing your little failed

688
00:29:02,748 --> 00:29:04,069
novel into a video game.

689
00:29:06,049 --> 00:29:08,750
So again, the interesting thing is that your player's

690
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,450
competence in Portal was the story.

691
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,931
It was your ability carrying you through that narrative.

692
00:29:14,451 --> 00:29:17,112
And so when you take that sort of story relevant competence

693
00:29:17,152 --> 00:29:18,412
and you combine it with agency.

694
00:29:18,955 --> 00:29:21,096
an achievable level of fidelity, like the stuff we talked

695
00:29:21,116 --> 00:29:23,138
about being more economical with the tools

696
00:29:23,158 --> 00:29:25,159
that you have available to you, then

697
00:29:25,179 --> 00:29:27,341
you can start to create emergent story outcomes

698
00:29:27,381 --> 00:29:28,782
without a heavy content burden.

699
00:29:30,003 --> 00:29:31,624
So let's talk about that connection just a little bit

700
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:31,804
more.

701
00:29:32,765 --> 00:29:35,687
Game mechanics and the story, they

702
00:29:35,727 --> 00:29:39,950
need to be implement or game mechanics and character

703
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:42,692
interactions need to be implemented as mechanic or,

704
00:29:42,852 --> 00:29:43,072
sorry.

705
00:29:43,132 --> 00:29:45,073
Let me start that one more time because I can't read my slides.

706
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:49,256
Game mechanics and story need to be communicating seamlessly.

707
00:29:49,276 --> 00:29:51,338
And so you want to implement your story and character

708
00:29:51,378 --> 00:29:52,599
interactions as systems.

709
00:29:52,939 --> 00:29:55,021
So the player-generated story events

710
00:29:55,201 --> 00:29:58,604
and the computer-generated story events occur at the same level.

711
00:29:58,784 --> 00:30:00,405
The player should not distinguish a difference

712
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:03,928
between what I did and what the world did in any sort of way.

713
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,330
Because at that point, they're just

714
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,651
looking at how the world works.

715
00:30:07,351 --> 00:30:09,653
If there's no rift between the fidelity of the story

716
00:30:09,693 --> 00:30:11,035
and the fidelity of the gameplay.

717
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,941
then the player perceives those things at the same level

718
00:30:13,981 --> 00:30:15,401
and they become one experience.

719
00:30:15,662 --> 00:30:16,982
So let's talk about some ways you

720
00:30:17,002 --> 00:30:19,003
can do that and some examples from games

721
00:30:19,403 --> 00:30:20,204
that have accomplished this.

722
00:30:21,104 --> 00:30:23,505
One example is conversation systems in games.

723
00:30:24,815 --> 00:30:30,117
If they have not only story utility, but also bartering or gameplay utility,

724
00:30:30,658 --> 00:30:33,058
and if social interaction is part of the game,

725
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,180
then that simply becomes something the player perceives as a system in the game,

726
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,700
and just one of the things I do.

727
00:30:38,821 --> 00:30:41,181
So sometimes I talk to people because I want information.

728
00:30:41,281 --> 00:30:43,842
Sometimes I just want some knowledge about the world.

729
00:30:43,922 --> 00:30:48,304
Sometimes I'm trying to buy my way through a guard post and bribe this guard.

730
00:30:48,344 --> 00:30:50,045
Sometimes I'm buying something from someone.

731
00:30:51,026 --> 00:30:55,070
If you can get it to where all of the story and the gameplay are funneling through the same system,

732
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:57,653
and you should have many of these systems in your game, but this is one example,

733
00:30:58,013 --> 00:31:00,516
if that's all coming through one system, the player simply sees it as,

734
00:31:00,796 --> 00:31:02,398
this is how the world that I'm in works.

735
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:06,082
And so they don't start to, you know, distinguish between this is a story scene,

736
00:31:06,122 --> 00:31:09,225
this is a gameplay scene, and these things are, you know, at opposite ends of the spectrum.

737
00:31:10,306 --> 00:31:10,907
Another example.

738
00:31:11,732 --> 00:31:14,473
is games that use sort of abstracted representations

739
00:31:14,513 --> 00:31:17,755
of story content and expose those elements as game systems.

740
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:22,157
So for example, notes that you find in World of Warcraft

741
00:31:22,177 --> 00:31:23,718
when you loot a body that give you a quest.

742
00:31:24,438 --> 00:31:26,239
Usually in that game, you go talk to a character

743
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:28,680
and a bubble comes up that describes the quest,

744
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,721
and you hit accept, and you've got it.

745
00:31:29,761 --> 00:31:30,982
But every now and then, you're out in the world

746
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:32,903
and you kill a monster, and you go to loot it,

747
00:31:32,923 --> 00:31:34,303
which is something you do all the time.

748
00:31:34,343 --> 00:31:35,844
It's just a game system, it's a game mechanic.

749
00:31:36,211 --> 00:31:37,913
And there's a note and you're like, that looks curious.

750
00:31:37,953 --> 00:31:40,915
And you open it the same way that you would open a lockbox or, you know, one of

751
00:31:40,935 --> 00:31:42,377
those pearls you find on the beach and stuff.

752
00:31:42,997 --> 00:31:44,779
And it pops up the quest thing.

753
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,661
You're like, oh wow, I found this thing in this dude's pocket.

754
00:31:46,701 --> 00:31:47,582
And whoa, it's mysterious.

755
00:31:47,622 --> 00:31:48,062
It's a quest.

756
00:31:48,102 --> 00:31:48,763
I'll accept that.

757
00:31:48,843 --> 00:31:50,564
And ding, it goes in your quest log.

758
00:31:50,604 --> 00:31:53,587
And all of a sudden you feel like, I was out in the world and I did something and I

759
00:31:53,627 --> 00:31:57,411
picked something up using this system that I use all the time and found a little neat

760
00:31:57,431 --> 00:31:58,331
little story bit.

761
00:31:58,532 --> 00:31:59,613
And now I'm on a new quest.

762
00:32:00,034 --> 00:32:03,396
And it's a really interesting way to sort of mix it up for players and also, again,

763
00:32:03,497 --> 00:32:08,040
integrate that story a little bit more into the gameplay through a simple existing mechanic.

764
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,982
Another example of that is hacking in a game like Deus Ex.

765
00:32:11,622 --> 00:32:15,084
Players simply say, you know, if you invest in hacking, you're like, I can hack stuff.

766
00:32:15,565 --> 00:32:19,407
Sometimes I'm going to hack a security station to turn off a camera to make it easier to

767
00:32:19,447 --> 00:32:20,888
get into this, you know, guard outpost.

768
00:32:21,269 --> 00:32:23,450
Sometimes I'm going to hack an ATM to steal some money.

769
00:32:24,031 --> 00:32:26,392
Sometimes I'm going to hack someone's computer to read their email.

770
00:32:26,939 --> 00:32:31,120
And that kind of runs the gamut of gameplay to story relevance.

771
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,621
When you read those emails, you get insight into the world.

772
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:36,621
And it doesn't feel cheap.

773
00:32:36,641 --> 00:32:39,382
You actually feel like you're invading their privacy a little

774
00:32:39,402 --> 00:32:42,223
bit and getting into the stories of the bad guys.

775
00:32:42,763 --> 00:32:45,623
And it's also, by the way, a cheap way for text and writing

776
00:32:45,823 --> 00:32:47,644
to be isolated, like we talked about,

777
00:32:48,224 --> 00:32:50,245
in a way that allows the player to absorb information

778
00:32:50,265 --> 00:32:52,345
without, again, creating these super expensive cut

779
00:32:52,365 --> 00:32:52,985
scenes and whatnot.

780
00:32:54,295 --> 00:32:57,618
The player simply says, I can hack stuff and I hack different things for different results,

781
00:32:57,738 --> 00:33:00,121
but sometimes that's story and sometimes that's gameplay,

782
00:33:00,181 --> 00:33:01,842
and they don't really perceive that difference that much,

783
00:33:01,882 --> 00:33:03,684
because it's simply how the world works.

784
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:06,387
And I want to take a quick detour here,

785
00:33:06,527 --> 00:33:09,771
because I'm talking a lot about systems and a lot about mechanics

786
00:33:09,891 --> 00:33:12,313
and a lot about systematizing things and all that stuff,

787
00:33:12,413 --> 00:33:15,576
and I want to be very clear that I'm not trying to...

788
00:33:16,168 --> 00:33:20,169
make everything super bland and make everything just boil down to ones and zeros

789
00:33:20,869 --> 00:33:24,210
and say that we shouldn't be creating really awesome interesting fictional

790
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:27,891
worlds. I love that stuff. I really think we definitely should be creating those

791
00:33:27,931 --> 00:33:31,152
worlds. We should create fascinating worlds with vibrant characters because

792
00:33:31,172 --> 00:33:34,113
that's where players want to go. They want to step into a scene like that and

793
00:33:34,193 --> 00:33:35,334
find out what's around the corner.

794
00:33:36,894 --> 00:33:41,396
This isn't about removing fiction or flavor or personality from your games.

795
00:33:41,416 --> 00:33:42,276
This is simply about...

796
00:33:42,817 --> 00:33:45,920
removing a really prescriptive linear narrative from your game.

797
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,841
So you want to create worlds that are really interesting,

798
00:33:47,862 --> 00:33:50,624
where the player wants to interact with different people and different elements,

799
00:33:51,045 --> 00:33:53,527
and tell his own story and explore and all that stuff.

800
00:33:54,428 --> 00:33:55,529
You want to create all that stuff.

801
00:33:56,009 --> 00:33:59,813
It's just about not necessarily making it a completely linear narrative within that world.

802
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:01,975
So, just wanted to make sure I was clear that I'm not saying

803
00:34:02,035 --> 00:34:04,357
just make everything bland and make it all just, you know,

804
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,240
these little 16-bit indie games.

805
00:34:08,953 --> 00:34:12,415
So let's look at a couple games that have actually expressed key story moments through mechanics.

806
00:34:12,515 --> 00:34:14,757
And the first one I was just talking about, I'll talk about Deus Ex.

807
00:34:15,377 --> 00:34:19,040
And this is the scene where you find Paul Denton back at the apartment, he's your brother.

808
00:34:19,681 --> 00:34:22,963
And you're at his apartment and you're getting ready to get raided by the bad guys.

809
00:34:23,383 --> 00:34:24,904
And so you walk up to him, you're like, hey, we gotta go.

810
00:34:24,984 --> 00:34:27,606
And then the bad guys beat on the door and they're like, come out, come out.

811
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:29,588
And you're like, shit, man, we gotta roll.

812
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:31,289
And he says, oh, I'm hurt, I can't make it.

813
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:32,570
You say, I can't just leave you here.

814
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:35,011
And he goes, run, don't worry about me, don't be a fool, just go.

815
00:34:35,646 --> 00:34:38,167
And then the guys break in and there's a firefight and there's Paul.

816
00:34:38,207 --> 00:34:40,128
He gets up and he's fighting and you have a choice.

817
00:34:40,568 --> 00:34:43,029
Am I going to stay and fight with my brother or am I going to bail?

818
00:34:43,049 --> 00:34:44,850
Because he said, get out of here, save yourself.

819
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:46,171
That's a heroic thing for him to say.

820
00:34:46,671 --> 00:34:47,191
What do you do?

821
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:51,754
So and you know, one version of this, you head out the window like a coward.

822
00:34:52,354 --> 00:34:56,296
And in the next level, you find his dead body because you left him to die.

823
00:34:56,316 --> 00:34:57,096
You left him to his fate.

824
00:34:57,116 --> 00:34:58,097
You're like, crap.

825
00:34:58,277 --> 00:35:02,819
When I made that decision, which wasn't, you know, a press X or Y to do whatever.

826
00:35:02,879 --> 00:35:03,139
It was a.

827
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:07,221
you know, using the verbs of the game, movement, combat, conversation.

828
00:35:08,702 --> 00:35:12,085
When you made that decision, those results came out again in the game.

829
00:35:12,145 --> 00:35:13,746
You found that body through exploration.

830
00:35:14,587 --> 00:35:16,228
But let's roll back the clock a little bit.

831
00:35:16,828 --> 00:35:17,929
Back to that scene in the apartment.

832
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,290
What if you did fight your way out with him?

833
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:21,691
And you go out in the hallway and you're brave and you stand beside your brother

834
00:35:21,712 --> 00:35:24,393
and you kill everybody and, you know, it's a very heroic moment.

835
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,355
You fight your way out the lobby and you guys survive.

836
00:35:26,815 --> 00:35:28,796
And the next level in the same spot you find him alive.

837
00:35:28,816 --> 00:35:30,037
You're like, wow, that's awesome.

838
00:35:30,197 --> 00:35:32,479
I made a choice as a player and it played out in the game.

839
00:35:33,408 --> 00:35:37,551
And more importantly, that choice was expressed seamlessly through mechanics.

840
00:35:37,631 --> 00:35:42,576
It wasn't, again, like a big choose, you know, X or Y to make a decision or a conversation

841
00:35:42,616 --> 00:35:43,216
tree or whatever.

842
00:35:44,297 --> 00:35:48,301
You've got these systems like combat and navigation and conversation and these data links that,

843
00:35:48,341 --> 00:35:49,622
you know, people will talk to you from.

844
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:53,125
And you simply took in your environment and made a call right there in a very heat of

845
00:35:53,145 --> 00:35:54,847
the moment, you know, decision.

846
00:35:55,387 --> 00:35:56,028
And you lived with it.

847
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,783
You know, the results of that decision were fed back to you through those same means.

848
00:36:01,803 --> 00:36:03,904
You got data links about, you know, where your brother was.

849
00:36:04,284 --> 00:36:09,248
You even discovered his fate, either dead or alive, by exploring hostile territory and playing the game.

850
00:36:09,288 --> 00:36:11,849
And you came across it in one of the rooms that you hacked your way into.

851
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:14,171
So it's all very unified.

852
00:36:14,956 --> 00:36:19,519
Ultimately, though, it wasn't, again, an example of a true player-driven story because in the

853
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:21,160
game it was a sort of short loop.

854
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,581
It was mostly cosmetic.

855
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:27,624
It didn't change the narrative for the long haul of the game and didn't meaningfully open

856
00:36:27,664 --> 00:36:28,965
up new branches or anything else like that.

857
00:36:29,025 --> 00:36:34,249
So it's not a perfect example of a true player-driven story, but it does show that core mechanics

858
00:36:34,309 --> 00:36:39,292
can let players express intent seamlessly because Paul was just another guy fighting

859
00:36:39,312 --> 00:36:42,094
in that firefight with you and you just followed him and stayed with him and that's how you

860
00:36:42,114 --> 00:36:43,135
made your decision, or not.

861
00:36:44,355 --> 00:36:46,156
Next example I want to talk about is Red Dead Redemption.

862
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:48,558
This is just a huge spoiler.

863
00:36:48,578 --> 00:36:51,140
So if you haven't played this game, beware.

864
00:36:51,601 --> 00:36:56,004
But despite the fact that in traditional Rockstar style,

865
00:36:56,745 --> 00:36:59,767
Red Dead is a very, very sort of cut scene heavy, dialogue

866
00:36:59,787 --> 00:37:01,589
heavy, character story heavy game.

867
00:37:02,049 --> 00:37:04,591
It had some very, very powerful moments that were expressed

868
00:37:04,611 --> 00:37:05,232
through mechanics.

869
00:37:05,712 --> 00:37:07,854
If you played the game, you remember riding into Mexico.

870
00:37:08,134 --> 00:37:10,056
You're riding through the desert on your horse

871
00:37:10,076 --> 00:37:10,837
like you always do.

872
00:37:11,297 --> 00:37:12,818
Or when you're training your son to hunt,

873
00:37:13,508 --> 00:37:16,410
going out and doing the same hunting verbs you did as a player, and when you see him

874
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:19,612
do it, it's like really touching because you feel like you're actually teaching him something.

875
00:37:20,152 --> 00:37:25,234
And one example of this I really want to dig into is the Deadeye mechanic, which is basically

876
00:37:25,294 --> 00:37:28,416
it's bullet time, it's a way that, you know, as a player you can initiate a mode where

877
00:37:28,436 --> 00:37:32,398
it goes in a slow-mo and you can tag different, you know, three or four, maybe even five if

878
00:37:32,418 --> 00:37:35,860
you're really good guys, and then when the slow-mo releases you, boom, boom, boom, shoot

879
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,622
them down, you know, like a, you know, Wild West kind of gunfight.

880
00:37:39,662 --> 00:37:41,843
So here's an example of the Deadeye mechanic.

881
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:47,071
Experienced players can place the shots individually to devastating effect.

882
00:37:50,633 --> 00:37:52,234
So that's what the Deadeye mechanic is.

883
00:37:53,135 --> 00:37:55,236
And now we're going to look at the endgame cutscene.

884
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:56,396
At this point,

885
00:37:57,157 --> 00:38:01,419
John Marston, who's our hero, has sent his wife and kid off to safety

886
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:05,341
and he's kind of at his own personal Waterloo. He's surrounded by federal

887
00:38:05,381 --> 00:38:08,643
agents, he's in his barn and it's come to, you know, the showdown in the game.

888
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:11,425
Here's the last scene of this part of the game.

889
00:39:09,899 --> 00:39:15,564
Now that's 90% cutscene and 10% gameplay, but that 10% of gameplay was brilliant because

890
00:39:16,025 --> 00:39:19,308
as you play through the game, you've probably gone into Dead Eye hundreds of times and you

891
00:39:19,348 --> 00:39:22,772
knew instinctively what the system did, what it was capable of, and what the outcomes would

892
00:39:22,792 --> 00:39:22,952
be.

893
00:39:23,332 --> 00:39:26,275
You knew that you could, if you were really good, maybe, you know, peel off like five

894
00:39:26,315 --> 00:39:27,376
guys before they got to you.

895
00:39:27,697 --> 00:39:30,560
So when you stepped out there and the game forced you into Dead Eye and you're surrounded

896
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:30,820
by 20 people.

897
00:39:31,621 --> 00:39:38,609
You panicked yourself, not for him, yourself, because you identified so closely with that viewpoint and with what was happening right there.

898
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:43,675
And you said, oh my god, my competence as a player, this isn't enough, I'm doomed, I'm dead, oh shit.

899
00:39:43,775 --> 00:39:46,718
And that all went through your head, you know, in a flash.

900
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:50,082
And you realized viscerally in a way that really identified with that player.

901
00:39:50,683 --> 00:39:53,303
exactly what was going to happen, and you knew it.

902
00:39:53,423 --> 00:39:57,004
And they, you know, they sold that sense of despair and finality

903
00:39:57,384 --> 00:40:00,605
through using that mechanic better than any cutscene could have, you know?

904
00:40:00,645 --> 00:40:03,845
The rest of that cutscene looked great and it was cool and it's a wonderful thing to watch,

905
00:40:03,905 --> 00:40:08,286
but inserting that dead-eye mechanic into the middle of it made it so powerful.

906
00:40:09,446 --> 00:40:11,667
So yeah, you just felt like, I am doomed with him.

907
00:40:11,727 --> 00:40:14,567
You felt like you were going to lose that, not watch him lose it.

908
00:40:14,627 --> 00:40:17,748
So it's a very, very powerful example, especially if you played the game up to that point,

909
00:40:18,148 --> 00:40:20,188
of how mechanics can be used to really...

910
00:40:20,814 --> 00:40:24,816
heighten the emotional impact of a story moment, even if it is a scripted story moment like

911
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:25,036
that.

912
00:40:26,516 --> 00:40:30,638
So, to wrap up the discussion of agency and fidelity and competence, which we've been

913
00:40:30,718 --> 00:40:34,740
talking about for a while, I want to talk about a quote from my friend J.P. Labreton,

914
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,761
who was a level designer on Bioshock.

915
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:40,042
He was a lead level designer on Bioshock 2, and in general is one of the smartest dudes

916
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,402
you'll ever meet talking about games.

917
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:45,724
And this is from an article he wrote on Rock, Paper, Shotgun about Deus Ex.

918
00:40:45,744 --> 00:40:48,925
It was sort of like a little retrospective series they did last year.

919
00:40:49,706 --> 00:40:49,826
And...

920
00:40:50,828 --> 00:40:51,488
The quote is this,

921
00:40:52,309 --> 00:40:54,810
the capitalized word that comes to me now is fidelity.

922
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:57,411
I ponder how incredibly difficult it would be

923
00:40:57,491 --> 00:40:59,932
to make a game like Deus Ex for a major publisher today.

924
00:41:00,612 --> 00:41:02,233
Reasonably advanced for 2000,

925
00:41:02,413 --> 00:41:04,774
today it's clear DX's simple environments

926
00:41:04,954 --> 00:41:08,496
and primitive people enabled both its scope and its depth.

927
00:41:09,396 --> 00:41:10,897
Our standards have risen in some ways,

928
00:41:11,037 --> 00:41:13,158
but are they unequivocally the right ways?

929
00:41:13,799 --> 00:41:15,779
I love that, I'm in love with that quote.

930
00:41:15,819 --> 00:41:17,620
Like I wanna kiss him on the mouth every time I read that.

931
00:41:18,315 --> 00:41:21,136
Uh, because, you know, when you look back at Deus Ex now, people joke,

932
00:41:21,216 --> 00:41:24,418
oh yeah, the characters look terrible and the voice acting was actually kind of bad.

933
00:41:25,018 --> 00:41:25,898
But people are joking.

934
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,540
Like, it's sort of like you laugh about it a little bit,

935
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,961
but like that doesn't diminish the experience in any way.

936
00:41:31,461 --> 00:41:32,642
So, so think about that.

937
00:41:32,722 --> 00:41:33,982
And, you know, when you're building games,

938
00:41:34,122 --> 00:41:36,804
don't just assume that we have to do things in the fanciest way possible.

939
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:40,746
And consider how we can give players more agency and let them be more expressive.

940
00:41:41,326 --> 00:41:43,407
Uh, and use our, you know, abilities in smarter ways.

941
00:41:43,727 --> 00:41:45,268
Um, so we've talked about.

942
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:49,178
Given the player-unified agency, we've talked about trying to find a manageable level of

943
00:41:49,218 --> 00:41:54,360
fidelity by using those elements in more intelligent ways, more efficient ways that are still stylish

944
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:54,860
and cool.

945
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:59,761
And we've also talked about how the player's competence can contribute to stories, but

946
00:41:59,801 --> 00:42:01,802
that only covers the mechanics half of this discussion.

947
00:42:03,002 --> 00:42:03,822
How are we going to...

948
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:08,391
create actual stories out of those sort of lessons we've learned as developers there.

949
00:42:09,312 --> 00:42:13,694
We haven't addressed relatedness yet, so let's come back to our friend here, which again

950
00:42:13,754 --> 00:42:17,735
is the desire to interact with or connect to or develop relationships with other people.

951
00:42:18,876 --> 00:42:23,378
If we just have unified agency and a competence that contributes to the narrative, we've likely

952
00:42:23,418 --> 00:42:28,180
created a new problem that I think of as system soup, which is basically saying that like,

953
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,841
yeah, this game's really reactive, the player can do a whole bunch of stuff.

954
00:42:31,771 --> 00:42:33,832
But it's just this series of flat interactions

955
00:42:33,872 --> 00:42:34,812
that have no resolution.

956
00:42:34,873 --> 00:42:38,494
It's just a bunch of just moment to moment type stuff

957
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,675
that over eight hours doesn't amount to anything.

958
00:42:40,796 --> 00:42:43,757
It's a toy box, which is fine.

959
00:42:43,897 --> 00:42:47,019
But good stories come from peaks and valleys and relationships

960
00:42:47,059 --> 00:42:49,680
that resolve over time and increasing tension and conflict

961
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,361
and all the great stuff that you can

962
00:42:51,381 --> 00:42:53,302
look at in any sort of screenwriting book or whatever.

963
00:42:54,162 --> 00:42:55,463
So how do we solve that?

964
00:42:55,483 --> 00:42:56,884
How do we go from this system soup

965
00:42:56,984 --> 00:42:58,745
into allowing the systems we've created

966
00:42:59,025 --> 00:43:01,486
to actually create a narrative that means something over time?

967
00:43:02,757 --> 00:43:06,639
We have to look at the chaos that we've created with these uncontrolled systems and figure

968
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:10,221
out how to bring order from that chaos, how to understand what's there.

969
00:43:10,401 --> 00:43:12,202
But what kind of order are we looking for?

970
00:43:12,382 --> 00:43:13,343
What has meaning?

971
00:43:14,824 --> 00:43:19,146
The game that you're making needs to understand and respond to key interactions and comprehend

972
00:43:19,246 --> 00:43:19,546
meaning.

973
00:43:19,667 --> 00:43:23,989
It needs to, you know, understand the times when events culminate in turning points that

974
00:43:24,049 --> 00:43:25,010
resonate with the players.

975
00:43:25,931 --> 00:43:29,133
These are things like, you know, in a traditional story, the death of a lover, or parting with

976
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:33,657
a friend, leaving home for the first time, having your life saved, you know, all the

977
00:43:33,697 --> 00:43:37,000
major moments, you know, finally having that big conflict with your mortal enemy.

978
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:38,921
How do we do that?

979
00:43:40,022 --> 00:43:43,625
Well, first off, the game has to listen to what the player's doing and figure out what

980
00:43:43,645 --> 00:43:44,746
the player's actions mean.

981
00:43:44,926 --> 00:43:47,208
That's step one, which is basically discerning meaning.

982
00:43:47,528 --> 00:43:51,392
And I'll use a cheesy little graph here to talk about sort of...

983
00:43:52,291 --> 00:43:56,852
Understanding the qualitative value and quantitative impact of a given gameplay interaction in a game.

984
00:43:56,972 --> 00:44:03,794
So, here's a graph, very simple, good on the right, evil on the left, and amplitude, which is basically the impact of the event.

985
00:44:04,234 --> 00:44:09,215
So let's put some points on here just to demonstrate what we can, you know, try to get from a series of interactions.

986
00:44:09,635 --> 00:44:11,155
First, giving a homeless man food.

987
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:18,177
It's a nice thing to do, it's like a three, but it's a homeless dude, he's probably not super important in the story, so it's only a two on the amplitude scale.

988
00:44:19,737 --> 00:44:20,958
Snubbing the mayor at a party.

989
00:44:21,738 --> 00:44:24,979
Not really a big deal, it's not super, you know, you didn't murder the guy.

990
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:27,719
But he's also an important guy, so it's still a 5 on the amplitude scale,

991
00:44:27,739 --> 00:44:28,799
because he's going to remember that.

992
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:31,940
So that has a different sort of quantitative value.

993
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,220
Killing a dictator.

994
00:44:34,461 --> 00:44:37,101
That's pretty sweet, because he was oppressing a whole nation of people,

995
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:38,861
and you've, you know, freed them from oppression.

996
00:44:39,642 --> 00:44:42,922
And it's, you know, really big deal, because it affects not only you and the story,

997
00:44:42,942 --> 00:44:44,943
but also, you know, a whole nation.

998
00:44:44,983 --> 00:44:47,483
So that's a pretty sweet, like, good, big event.

999
00:44:48,303 --> 00:44:50,184
Opposite end of the spectrum, killing your best friend.

1000
00:44:50,484 --> 00:44:51,144
Terrible thing to do.

1001
00:44:52,174 --> 00:44:57,676
It's evil to kill someone and it's also super bad because, you know, one would assume that

1002
00:44:57,696 --> 00:45:01,577
your best friend, that's a relationship that's been built up over 10, 20, 30, however many

1003
00:45:01,617 --> 00:45:01,897
years.

1004
00:45:02,457 --> 00:45:09,359
So basically, if you have a game that can understand these individual events and understand

1005
00:45:09,419 --> 00:45:14,340
what they mean and understand the value and the amplitude of these events, how do we have

1006
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:16,081
that have an effect over time?

1007
00:45:16,641 --> 00:45:19,862
And basically what we have to do is take those assigned values, those events that the game

1008
00:45:19,882 --> 00:45:20,502
can understand.

1009
00:45:21,094 --> 00:45:26,077
and apply them to long-term relationships and, you know, allow a series of events to

1010
00:45:26,117 --> 00:45:29,359
develop an understanding of a relationship in basically a database somewhere.

1011
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:34,002
For example, you know, if you do a lot of nice things to another character in a game,

1012
00:45:34,062 --> 00:45:38,485
healing them or joining them in a firefight or giving them food or whatever, that could

1013
00:45:38,525 --> 00:45:40,166
develop over time into a friendship.

1014
00:45:40,567 --> 00:45:44,289
And then once the game understands those relationships and understands sort of that relationship

1015
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:48,352
database that you're building as a player with your actions, not what the story is defined

1016
00:45:48,372 --> 00:45:49,693
for you but what you have expressed.

1017
00:45:50,329 --> 00:45:52,250
through your intent as a player through these systems,

1018
00:45:54,031 --> 00:45:55,692
the game can start to react in proportion

1019
00:45:55,732 --> 00:45:57,093
to the strength of those relationships.

1020
00:45:58,053 --> 00:45:59,814
So what's an example of a game that

1021
00:45:59,914 --> 00:46:02,135
understands the meaning of events over time

1022
00:46:02,155 --> 00:46:04,516
and is able to create gameplay out of those player-creator

1023
00:46:04,556 --> 00:46:05,077
relationships?

1024
00:46:05,897 --> 00:46:08,218
And there's actually a lot of really good examples of this.

1025
00:46:08,838 --> 00:46:10,739
This is Civilization V, but it's probably

1026
00:46:10,759 --> 00:46:11,940
true of most strategy games.

1027
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:14,141
And basically, this is actually a solved problem.

1028
00:46:15,282 --> 00:46:16,742
It's pretty fundamental to strategy games

1029
00:46:16,762 --> 00:46:18,843
that all of the entities, be that players or AIs.

1030
00:46:19,415 --> 00:46:20,275
have all of the verbs.

1031
00:46:20,435 --> 00:46:22,135
So there's our unified agency again.

1032
00:46:22,175 --> 00:46:22,935
Let's not forget that.

1033
00:46:23,555 --> 00:46:24,776
And they all have the same abilities.

1034
00:46:25,216 --> 00:46:26,816
And they track relationships over time

1035
00:46:26,836 --> 00:46:28,976
and let those relationships feed into decisions.

1036
00:46:29,016 --> 00:46:31,677
So attack means, oh my god, now we've gone hostile.

1037
00:46:31,717 --> 00:46:34,917
That would be sort of up and on the left on our chart

1038
00:46:34,957 --> 00:46:35,297
back there.

1039
00:46:37,018 --> 00:46:38,918
And that becomes a war.

1040
00:46:38,938 --> 00:46:40,338
And maybe you sign a peace treaty,

1041
00:46:40,358 --> 00:46:42,419
but it's tenuous because you know that that war is still

1042
00:46:42,459 --> 00:46:42,739
lingering.

1043
00:46:42,759 --> 00:46:44,559
That hasn't yet still in the database somewhere,

1044
00:46:44,679 --> 00:46:47,160
or an alliance, or factions, all that stuff.

1045
00:46:48,085 --> 00:46:49,446
That's a big part of strategy games.

1046
00:46:49,767 --> 00:46:52,489
Now, it's not terribly emotionally compelling,

1047
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:54,290
because strategy games are generally played

1048
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:55,971
from an isometric view, and you're not

1049
00:46:56,072 --> 00:46:59,674
relating to characters on a daily basis

1050
00:46:59,714 --> 00:47:00,775
or moment-to-moment basis.

1051
00:47:00,835 --> 00:47:02,677
And there's a lot of exposed math,

1052
00:47:02,717 --> 00:47:03,757
and so they're not really making it

1053
00:47:04,118 --> 00:47:05,759
into an emotional state of affairs.

1054
00:47:05,779 --> 00:47:07,480
But that's really a matter of presentation.

1055
00:47:07,901 --> 00:47:10,142
That's not saying that you can't do this sort of relationship

1056
00:47:10,182 --> 00:47:11,003
tracking under the hood.

1057
00:47:11,383 --> 00:47:14,766
So it's worth asking, how could that proven backbone?

1058
00:47:15,129 --> 00:47:18,652
of relationship tracking be ported to a game with more traditional characters and subject

1059
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:18,872
matter.

1060
00:47:20,114 --> 00:47:23,437
And when the relationship is there, characters in the story should be able to take advantage

1061
00:47:23,477 --> 00:47:27,341
of it and express what's going on behind the scenes in a more human way.

1062
00:47:28,442 --> 00:47:31,846
And this is heavily connected to that level of manageable fidelity we talked about before.

1063
00:47:32,847 --> 00:47:36,931
The challenge is deciding how to reasonably feedback these moments, and that is a big

1064
00:47:36,951 --> 00:47:37,932
challenge with human characters.

1065
00:47:38,863 --> 00:47:41,745
Hopefully, some of the techniques we talked about can get you a leg up there in terms

1066
00:47:41,785 --> 00:47:46,329
of isolating your VO or finding a really cool storytelling style that isn't as expensive.

1067
00:47:46,729 --> 00:47:50,773
But one approach is to basically, you know, you know what the verbs are in your game.

1068
00:47:50,793 --> 00:47:51,693
You know what the player can do.

1069
00:47:51,753 --> 00:47:53,035
You know what the big moments are going to be.

1070
00:47:53,075 --> 00:47:56,217
That's going to be different for every game, but you understand what the player's capabilities

1071
00:47:56,257 --> 00:47:57,799
are because you're giving him those verbs.

1072
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,082
So that probably means that you can understand what some of the biggest things that he could

1073
00:48:02,122 --> 00:48:02,422
do is.

1074
00:48:02,442 --> 00:48:06,146
And so, let's say you were to take your top five events that the player could do that,

1075
00:48:06,326 --> 00:48:06,526
you know.

1076
00:48:07,063 --> 00:48:08,824
you would understand to have big impact,

1077
00:48:09,264 --> 00:48:10,604
and just create a suite of reactions,

1078
00:48:10,644 --> 00:48:11,704
kind of like we talked about before,

1079
00:48:11,724 --> 00:48:15,785
of happy, mad, angry, surprised, confused, stuff like that.

1080
00:48:16,605 --> 00:48:18,706
And basically have a suite of reactions expressed

1081
00:48:18,746 --> 00:48:21,566
however makes sense in your game that are waiting

1082
00:48:21,606 --> 00:48:22,466
for the player's inputs.

1083
00:48:22,546 --> 00:48:25,367
This is not branching, but it's more like a switchboard,

1084
00:48:25,427 --> 00:48:26,707
where the game is saying they're listening,

1085
00:48:26,727 --> 00:48:28,648
and they're like, OK, player did this, connect it to this one.

1086
00:48:28,668 --> 00:48:29,928
Player did this, connect it to this one.

1087
00:48:30,368 --> 00:48:32,088
And basically listening for what the player's doing,

1088
00:48:32,128 --> 00:48:33,749
listen for the player's intent, and then

1089
00:48:33,809 --> 00:48:35,709
connecting it to the right response from the game.

1090
00:48:36,187 --> 00:48:39,028
And if you have that suite of reactions on cue,

1091
00:48:39,369 --> 00:48:41,430
cued up, ready to go, waiting for the player to poke

1092
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:44,172
the systems, that's significantly different

1093
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:44,952
than story branching.

1094
00:48:44,972 --> 00:48:46,233
Because story branching is taking

1095
00:48:46,633 --> 00:48:48,715
a series of predetermined events and giving the player

1096
00:48:48,755 --> 00:48:49,515
finite choice.

1097
00:48:49,555 --> 00:48:51,416
Whereas, if the game is listening and waiting

1098
00:48:51,456 --> 00:48:54,358
to react and feed back, then that

1099
00:48:54,418 --> 00:48:56,099
is allowing a lot more expressivity

1100
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:56,960
on the player's part.

1101
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,361
And again, when we go back to that relationship tracking

1102
00:48:59,381 --> 00:48:59,922
we talked about.

1103
00:49:01,131 --> 00:49:05,653
You can understand if it's the homeless guy versus the dictator or your best friend,

1104
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:08,095
you can understand the amplitude with which to feed back.

1105
00:49:08,675 --> 00:49:14,258
So you could have happy but doesn't really care, happy ecstatic, or angry but just kind of miffed

1106
00:49:14,298 --> 00:49:16,079
versus, oh my god, I'm going to kill your whole family.

1107
00:49:16,279 --> 00:49:21,462
You could have degrees of those reactions and basically just have those sitting in a hopper

1108
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:25,344
waiting for the player to poke the system so you can feed it back appropriately.

1109
00:49:26,205 --> 00:49:27,905
That's the beauty of agency and emergence, right?

1110
00:49:29,103 --> 00:49:31,565
And if the system has a reaction at the ready,

1111
00:49:31,605 --> 00:49:33,026
then if we use that kind of unified

1112
00:49:33,046 --> 00:49:34,807
for the other we talked about, so for example,

1113
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:36,448
a series in Deus Ex of data links

1114
00:49:36,468 --> 00:49:38,470
that are waiting for one of maybe 10 things

1115
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:39,170
the player could do.

1116
00:49:40,011 --> 00:49:41,832
Ultimately, you're going to have to pick a finite list,

1117
00:49:41,852 --> 00:49:43,593
so at least try to take your best guess.

1118
00:49:44,034 --> 00:49:47,296
But then you can kind of combine that robust relationship

1119
00:49:47,336 --> 00:49:49,357
tracking that is a solved problem again,

1120
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:52,499
and the story delivery methods that resonate with the player

1121
00:49:52,659 --> 00:49:54,681
and, again, allow for those emergent outcomes.

1122
00:49:55,846 --> 00:49:58,509
So tracking and learning, that is a solved problem.

1123
00:49:58,529 --> 00:50:00,630
We just have to apply these known solutions

1124
00:50:01,091 --> 00:50:03,693
to new territory in terms of presentation

1125
00:50:03,733 --> 00:50:04,633
and making it more human.

1126
00:50:04,693 --> 00:50:06,415
If you are making a character about human,

1127
00:50:06,435 --> 00:50:07,496
let's not make too many assumptions.

1128
00:50:08,596 --> 00:50:10,238
But how does that create a narrative?

1129
00:50:10,578 --> 00:50:11,339
Is that all it takes?

1130
00:50:11,939 --> 00:50:14,041
And no, I think there's a final piece left,

1131
00:50:14,141 --> 00:50:15,862
because that at least lets us understand

1132
00:50:15,882 --> 00:50:17,303
what the player has placed value in

1133
00:50:17,483 --> 00:50:19,645
and respond to actions related to that.

1134
00:50:20,185 --> 00:50:21,587
But stories still need structure.

1135
00:50:21,667 --> 00:50:23,088
They need a beginning and a middle and an end.

1136
00:50:25,353 --> 00:50:26,754
and they need form.

1137
00:50:27,074 --> 00:50:29,915
So let's look at a really, really simple example of this.

1138
00:50:29,935 --> 00:50:31,696
Everybody probably recognizes this.

1139
00:50:31,756 --> 00:50:33,057
It's a simple three-act structure.

1140
00:50:33,597 --> 00:50:35,818
And what that is is basically just time and tension.

1141
00:50:36,198 --> 00:50:38,279
Over time, dramatic tension rises and falls,

1142
00:50:38,339 --> 00:50:39,500
and like any good story,

1143
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,542
you basically have moments where big relationships resolve,

1144
00:50:44,582 --> 00:50:46,543
and you have falling action to give the audience a break,

1145
00:50:46,563 --> 00:50:47,984
and then you build up the tension over time,

1146
00:50:48,024 --> 00:50:49,284
and you have your climax at the end,

1147
00:50:49,304 --> 00:50:51,485
and then you quickly fall off and finish the story.

1148
00:50:51,526 --> 00:50:52,406
That's pretty standard.

1149
00:50:53,264 --> 00:50:55,105
This is a perfectly good example to work with.

1150
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:59,429
So if you have a game that can track the player's actions

1151
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:01,991
and understand how those actions create relationships,

1152
00:51:02,572 --> 00:51:04,193
and knows the kind of timeline that we

1153
00:51:04,233 --> 00:51:06,275
want to start feeding those relationships back on

1154
00:51:06,395 --> 00:51:08,556
and seeding events into the system,

1155
00:51:09,037 --> 00:51:10,418
then how does the game make that happen?

1156
00:51:10,758 --> 00:51:12,280
And to do that, you have to create moments.

1157
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:13,941
You have to understand enough about the player

1158
00:51:13,981 --> 00:51:15,522
that you can force those issues.

1159
00:51:16,523 --> 00:51:19,485
An example of this is, let's look at the movie Jaws.

1160
00:51:19,525 --> 00:51:20,767
This should be pretty familiar to everybody.

1161
00:51:21,619 --> 00:51:27,224
You've got your characters, you've got Chief Brody, you've got Quint, and you've got this big shark out in the ocean that's eating people.

1162
00:51:27,524 --> 00:51:30,307
And, you know, so these guys go out on a boat and they're going to hunt for this shark.

1163
00:51:30,847 --> 00:51:34,130
And they have some initial encounters that are scary but don't resolve.

1164
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:35,752
That's a little spike and then it falls back down.

1165
00:51:36,372 --> 00:51:41,437
And then you start getting into the heavy stuff at the end where Quint just eats it or gets eaten, I guess.

1166
00:51:41,998 --> 00:51:45,521
And then, of course, the final showdown between Brody and the shark.

1167
00:51:47,431 --> 00:51:50,253
You basically want to, you know, in this, when you're talking about creating moments,

1168
00:51:50,293 --> 00:51:53,756
you want to take that timeline that you agree that your story is going to occur on

1169
00:51:54,276 --> 00:51:57,059
and simply try to inject major moments at appropriate times.

1170
00:51:57,099 --> 00:51:59,200
And this is not to say that you pick what those moments are.

1171
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,401
In fact, you definitely shouldn't.

1172
00:52:01,142 --> 00:52:02,863
What you should do is basically, again,

1173
00:52:03,023 --> 00:52:06,046
peek into those relationships that the player has invested in over time

1174
00:52:06,666 --> 00:52:10,149
and say, hey, if this is the end of, you know, if this is in Act 3, this is our big shebang,

1175
00:52:10,549 --> 00:52:12,691
let's pick, you know, the biggest relationship the player's got.

1176
00:52:13,202 --> 00:52:16,004
and find the most opposite thing we could do, or a big twist,

1177
00:52:16,044 --> 00:52:16,504
or whatever.

1178
00:52:16,524 --> 00:52:18,425
You can actually quantify this stuff mathematically

1179
00:52:18,445 --> 00:52:19,526
and say, we want a big bang.

1180
00:52:19,566 --> 00:52:20,967
Let's pick one of those big relationships

1181
00:52:21,007 --> 00:52:22,168
and do something interesting with it.

1182
00:52:22,528 --> 00:52:24,669
Again, based off those verbs that the player has.

1183
00:52:24,709 --> 00:52:25,930
So it's going to be different for every player.

1184
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:28,391
And you probably don't want to have an exact schedule

1185
00:52:28,432 --> 00:52:30,493
on your timeline of when these events happen.

1186
00:52:30,513 --> 00:52:32,514
Probably build some variance in so it's not the same

1187
00:52:32,534 --> 00:52:36,657
and repetitive chronologically as the player replays the game.

1188
00:52:37,677 --> 00:52:41,081
But in general, you can have an understanding of what kind of arc resonates with players

1189
00:52:41,201 --> 00:52:44,924
and resonates with audiences without necessarily mandating exactly what those moments are.

1190
00:52:45,845 --> 00:52:49,188
And the key thing is when you do inject those moments into the game, when you do say, hey,

1191
00:52:49,229 --> 00:52:50,229
it's time for a big event.

1192
00:52:50,775 --> 00:52:53,817
that's the best time to listen and build your relationship data because, you know,

1193
00:52:54,077 --> 00:52:56,658
when the player's under pressure and reacting to extreme circumstances,

1194
00:52:56,758 --> 00:52:58,559
you're going to find out a lot about who that player is

1195
00:52:58,899 --> 00:53:00,060
and where their allegiances lie.

1196
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:01,200
Do they fight with their friend?

1197
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:02,201
Do they run?

1198
00:53:02,281 --> 00:53:03,581
Do they turn on somebody?

1199
00:53:03,601 --> 00:53:04,642
You know, all those kind of things.

1200
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,082
So, that's a good time to listen.

1201
00:53:06,102 --> 00:53:09,104
So, you sort of are benefiting yourself and helping to feed back into that database,

1202
00:53:09,764 --> 00:53:13,006
you know, by, uh, by injecting these big moments into games.

1203
00:53:13,606 --> 00:53:17,548
Um, one example of, of those big moments I'll talk about, uh, is actually something I know.

1204
00:53:17,932 --> 00:53:19,993
pretty well because it's Bioshock 2, a game I worked on.

1205
00:53:20,373 --> 00:53:23,455
And the story of the game revolved around a player who

1206
00:53:23,475 --> 00:53:26,737
was a Big Daddy and his little sister named Eleanor,

1207
00:53:26,957 --> 00:53:29,038
and her mother, Dr. Sophia Lamb.

1208
00:53:29,098 --> 00:53:29,899
It's kind of a triangle.

1209
00:53:29,999 --> 00:53:31,239
They were kind of fighting over Eleanor.

1210
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,041
And Big Daddies and Little Sisters

1211
00:53:34,081 --> 00:53:35,862
also had a mechanical relationship in the game.

1212
00:53:36,222 --> 00:53:37,863
Big Daddies could adopt Little Sisters.

1213
00:53:38,403 --> 00:53:39,884
There were more than one in the city.

1214
00:53:40,245 --> 00:53:42,186
And you could pick them up, and you could save them,

1215
00:53:42,366 --> 00:53:44,727
you could kill them, you could exploit them

1216
00:53:44,867 --> 00:53:47,048
to try to gather resources for your own power up.

1217
00:53:48,511 --> 00:53:53,476
And so it was sort of a relationship that was not only narrative but also mechanical in the game.

1218
00:53:53,656 --> 00:53:57,400
And then you had big sisters, which was the sort of larger character there,

1219
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:58,801
who were little sisters who had grown up.

1220
00:53:59,302 --> 00:54:02,585
And in Bioshock 2, they were LAM, the enemies,

1221
00:54:02,705 --> 00:54:05,948
personal sort of assassin force or personal protection force.

1222
00:54:06,488 --> 00:54:08,931
And so every now and then, those big sisters would come attack you.

1223
00:54:10,425 --> 00:54:14,409
And this is really an example of how game systems and story

1224
00:54:14,449 --> 00:54:15,910
systems were very closely tied.

1225
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:17,611
For example, how you dealt with the little sisters

1226
00:54:17,651 --> 00:54:19,293
over the course of the game and gameplay

1227
00:54:19,593 --> 00:54:22,475
defined what story outcomes you got at the end of the game,

1228
00:54:22,495 --> 00:54:23,696
you know, what ending you got.

1229
00:54:24,317 --> 00:54:26,218
So it's basically an example of the story and the theme

1230
00:54:26,278 --> 00:54:29,201
and the relationships and the gameplay very closely tied

1231
00:54:29,241 --> 00:54:29,541
together.

1232
00:54:29,961 --> 00:54:31,943
Now, how do we use that to create moments

1233
00:54:31,983 --> 00:54:32,904
like we were just talking about?

1234
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:34,785
What we were doing under the hood

1235
00:54:35,626 --> 00:54:37,087
was every time you dealt with a little sister,

1236
00:54:37,442 --> 00:54:38,523
we had a point value for that.

1237
00:54:39,124 --> 00:54:40,505
If you ignored them, that was zero.

1238
00:54:40,805 --> 00:54:41,686
If you killed them, that was...

1239
00:54:42,026 --> 00:54:43,528
I don't remember exactly, but it was like a five.

1240
00:54:44,349 --> 00:54:45,910
If you save them, that's a different number.

1241
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:47,311
And if you exploit them, that's a different number.

1242
00:54:47,331 --> 00:54:48,392
So we sort of had put a...

1243
00:54:49,253 --> 00:54:51,675
or not monetary, but numerical value

1244
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:54,057
on how you interacted with those in gameplay.

1245
00:54:54,818 --> 00:54:56,920
And then we had, separately, a schedule where we said,

1246
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:58,701
hey, we want to have some sweet boss fights

1247
00:54:58,741 --> 00:55:00,243
with these big sister characters who are...

1248
00:55:00,619 --> 00:55:03,020
you know, the most fearsome, you know, combatants in the game.

1249
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,801
And they are sent after you by Sophia Lam,

1250
00:55:05,841 --> 00:55:07,921
who cares about the little sisters that you're interacting with.

1251
00:55:07,961 --> 00:55:10,202
So there's a story and a gameplay connection there.

1252
00:55:10,762 --> 00:55:13,163
And those fights happened not on a story schedule.

1253
00:55:13,203 --> 00:55:15,163
It's not like we built a bunch of battle arenas and said,

1254
00:55:15,203 --> 00:55:17,164
at this point, you know, this thing happens in the story,

1255
00:55:17,184 --> 00:55:18,224
and you go in and boom.

1256
00:55:19,085 --> 00:55:20,405
You know, we did that like for the intro fight,

1257
00:55:20,425 --> 00:55:21,485
because you have to introduce mechanics.

1258
00:55:21,525 --> 00:55:24,106
But over the, you know, meat of the game,

1259
00:55:24,126 --> 00:55:25,427
the bread and butter, it was all systemic.

1260
00:55:25,898 --> 00:55:27,299
And so we basically had this schedule,

1261
00:55:27,339 --> 00:55:30,222
and we said whenever the player reaches a threshold

1262
00:55:30,262 --> 00:55:33,104
in dealing with little sisters, based on how he's doing it,

1263
00:55:33,164 --> 00:55:34,385
so it's going to be different for every player

1264
00:55:34,405 --> 00:55:36,067
because some players ignore them, some players kill them

1265
00:55:36,107 --> 00:55:37,488
all, some players save them all, whatever,

1266
00:55:38,269 --> 00:55:39,670
any combination of that math, once it

1267
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:41,591
reaches a certain threshold, say 10 points

1268
00:55:41,631 --> 00:55:44,114
or whatever that was, we'll send a big sister after the player.

1269
00:55:45,014 --> 00:55:47,036
And we actually did a lot of work on the AI side

1270
00:55:47,056 --> 00:55:48,978
to make sure that big sisters could fight you anywhere.

1271
00:55:49,614 --> 00:55:51,795
It wasn't like there were certain arenas or anything else like that.

1272
00:55:51,915 --> 00:55:54,816
No matter where you were and what you were doing, you could be in the middle of another

1273
00:55:54,856 --> 00:55:55,256
boss fight.

1274
00:55:55,316 --> 00:55:55,776
It didn't matter.

1275
00:55:55,816 --> 00:55:56,876
It was purely systemic.

1276
00:55:58,156 --> 00:56:01,097
So we made it so that this event could happen at any time.

1277
00:56:01,577 --> 00:56:06,339
And so, as the player started defining his relationship with those story slash gameplay

1278
00:56:06,379 --> 00:56:10,580
characters, those characters, you know, the big sisters, with a deep connection to the

1279
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:14,741
story and to the theme, interacted with the player based on the player's actions over

1280
00:56:14,801 --> 00:56:17,362
time in a way that no designer ever authored or set up.

1281
00:56:17,842 --> 00:56:19,283
So over the course of the game, we

1282
00:56:19,323 --> 00:56:21,064
listened to how the player was interacting with these.

1283
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:24,185
We agreed on this is about how often we want these to happen

1284
00:56:24,225 --> 00:56:26,226
if you're doing these different values.

1285
00:56:26,266 --> 00:56:28,307
And we just took our hands off the system and said, hey,

1286
00:56:28,988 --> 00:56:31,329
let's let the players decide when these things happen.

1287
00:56:32,349 --> 00:56:34,931
As with most examples here, it's not a true player-driven story

1288
00:56:35,371 --> 00:56:37,612
example because we didn't take it all the way.

1289
00:56:37,652 --> 00:56:39,333
If you saved all the little sisters, for example,

1290
00:56:39,373 --> 00:56:41,154
you couldn't cause the big sisters to revolt

1291
00:56:41,194 --> 00:56:42,094
against Lam or anything.

1292
00:56:42,134 --> 00:56:44,275
It wasn't like a full ecosystem where we closed the loop.

1293
00:56:44,595 --> 00:56:45,796
But it still was an example of.

1294
00:56:46,514 --> 00:56:48,635
taking those sort of tracking and learning and discerning

1295
00:56:49,135 --> 00:56:50,696
methods that are found in strategy games

1296
00:56:50,796 --> 00:56:54,199
and applying them to a more sort of emotional first person

1297
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:56,620
type game, more traditional AAA game.

1298
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:00,583
So that said, I think that seeding the system, once we've

1299
00:57:00,603 --> 00:57:02,744
done all that under the hood work, and trying

1300
00:57:02,804 --> 00:57:04,926
to create those moments actually kind of

1301
00:57:05,006 --> 00:57:06,707
is the final piece of the puzzle to creating these.

1302
00:57:07,187 --> 00:57:08,588
And we are almost out of time.

1303
00:57:08,628 --> 00:57:09,949
So I'm going to do a really quick recap.

1304
00:57:11,589 --> 00:57:13,910
Game stories aren't taking advantage of interactivity.

1305
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:15,110
We're copying other mediums.

1306
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:17,571
We're telling linear stories that players and our audience

1307
00:57:17,751 --> 00:57:18,611
are not contributing to.

1308
00:57:18,931 --> 00:57:21,071
We should be creating stories in which the player makes

1309
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:23,452
influential decisions that create unique narratives that

1310
00:57:23,552 --> 00:57:24,872
aren't prescribed by a designer.

1311
00:57:25,572 --> 00:57:27,913
And if we use the interactivity that's unique to our medium

1312
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:29,873
and look at what people want in their lives

1313
00:57:30,274 --> 00:57:32,074
and apply those desires to our goal,

1314
00:57:32,634 --> 00:57:33,794
then we can start letting players

1315
00:57:33,854 --> 00:57:35,915
affect every part of the worlds that we're building for them.

1316
00:57:36,855 --> 00:57:38,976
We've got to give up this arms race with fidelity that's

1317
00:57:38,996 --> 00:57:40,316
flimming our abilities so badly.

1318
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:43,882
And instead, look at how we can use the tools at our disposal

1319
00:57:43,962 --> 00:57:45,943
in smarter, more efficient ways that

1320
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:48,644
allow us to give our players more agency and ownership

1321
00:57:48,704 --> 00:57:49,665
in the worlds we're creating.

1322
00:57:50,005 --> 00:57:52,767
And if we own our choices and create systems

1323
00:57:53,107 --> 00:57:55,388
that allow our gameplay to communicate seamlessly

1324
00:57:55,428 --> 00:57:57,630
with our narratives, then we can start

1325
00:57:57,650 --> 00:57:59,491
to understand what the players' actions mean.

1326
00:57:59,731 --> 00:58:01,472
And from that data, we can build relationships.

1327
00:58:01,492 --> 00:58:02,713
And those are relationships that we

1328
00:58:02,733 --> 00:58:05,174
can manipulate in a way that forms a cohesive narrative

1329
00:58:05,474 --> 00:58:08,196
that's full of moments that mean something to our players based

1330
00:58:08,256 --> 00:58:10,117
on their own choices and their actions.

1331
00:58:10,527 --> 00:58:13,849
And if we can do those things, then we can create stories that are possible only in our

1332
00:58:13,909 --> 00:58:16,350
medium and players will make those stories their own.

1333
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:20,951
So if we as developers can get out of our own way and create worlds in which we're asking

1334
00:58:21,011 --> 00:58:24,793
our players to be the authors, then we really do have a chance to create meaningful player-driven

1335
00:58:24,813 --> 00:58:25,113
stories.

1336
00:58:25,473 --> 00:58:26,013
Thank you very much.
