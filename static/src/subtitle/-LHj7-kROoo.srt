1
00:00:07,075 --> 00:00:08,916
Big hand for Ozzy, he's doing a great job.

2
00:00:09,456 --> 00:00:09,977
And then, yeah.

3
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:14,740
So yeah, the joke is that Jeff finally passed the baton

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,042
over to Oz, and it's great, and we're looking forward

5
00:00:17,062 --> 00:00:19,304
to kind of the next few years of GDC.

6
00:00:20,064 --> 00:00:22,646
So my name is Luis Kruel, and I'm a senior technical artist

7
00:00:22,686 --> 00:00:23,226
at SideFX.

8
00:00:23,647 --> 00:00:27,490
SideFX is a software company, and I'll go into that

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,491
a little bit later, but welcome to my talk.

10
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:31,973
This is a great crowd, I'm super excited to be here.

11
00:00:34,317 --> 00:00:35,738
What I'm gonna be talking about a little bit,

12
00:00:35,778 --> 00:00:37,660
I'm gonna talk about the definition of proceduralism.

13
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,321
It's kind of like a weird buzzword right now

14
00:00:39,341 --> 00:00:40,602
to where it's kind of like PBR

15
00:00:40,702 --> 00:00:43,685
and there's people think that it's a magic silver bullet

16
00:00:43,725 --> 00:00:45,386
and everything can be solved with proceduralism.

17
00:00:46,267 --> 00:00:47,588
Then I wanna talk a little bit about

18
00:00:47,608 --> 00:00:49,990
how we roll out a procedural tool system.

19
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,211
And basically you're gonna start out

20
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:52,692
by basically building tools for you

21
00:00:53,172 --> 00:00:55,114
and then you're gonna move on and building tools for others

22
00:00:55,154 --> 00:00:56,775
and then you're gonna start building tools for everybody.

23
00:00:56,895 --> 00:00:58,717
And then there's kind of mind shifts that change

24
00:00:59,117 --> 00:01:00,638
when you kind of hit each of those stages.

25
00:01:02,349 --> 00:01:04,069
My background, so I was in game development

26
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:06,451
for about 10 years, and then recently I switched

27
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:09,612
to be a software developer, and my job is exactly the same.

28
00:01:11,153 --> 00:01:13,014
So basically before I used to write tools

29
00:01:13,034 --> 00:01:15,335
and maybe like 10, 20 people in the studio to use them,

30
00:01:15,716 --> 00:01:17,076
and then every now and then I would get an email

31
00:01:17,096 --> 00:01:18,737
and be like, hey, this is broken, can you fix this?

32
00:01:18,777 --> 00:01:19,378
Come to my desk.

33
00:01:19,798 --> 00:01:21,979
Same thing happens, but now it's just the whole industry,

34
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:22,579
which is awesome.

35
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,701
So I write tools, and then the tools get built into Houdini,

36
00:01:25,741 --> 00:01:26,842
and then everybody can use it,

37
00:01:26,882 --> 00:01:28,563
and then they'll still email me with broken stuff,

38
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:30,183
and I'll go to fix them, and I'll go visit them.

39
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,852
and help them, so it's an awesome.

40
00:01:33,512 --> 00:01:34,473
It's done a really great job.

41
00:01:34,773 --> 00:01:36,134
And this is not a Houdini sales pitch,

42
00:01:36,174 --> 00:01:37,755
so I'm gonna try as much as possible

43
00:01:37,795 --> 00:01:38,756
to kind of keep it up here,

44
00:01:38,836 --> 00:01:40,737
to where as a procedural software system,

45
00:01:40,757 --> 00:01:42,618
you could implement this in anything with scripting,

46
00:01:43,218 --> 00:01:44,659
but just kind of like at a high level.

47
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,281
I'm gonna mention a little bit of Houdini,

48
00:01:47,321 --> 00:01:50,083
but this is not like entirely about it.

49
00:01:50,963 --> 00:01:53,425
So what the hell is procedural content generation?

50
00:01:53,585 --> 00:01:55,066
And then some people call it PCG,

51
00:01:55,106 --> 00:01:56,447
which is procedural content generation.

52
00:01:56,747 --> 00:01:58,028
There's some talks in the AI Summit

53
00:01:58,048 --> 00:01:59,369
that I'm gonna be immediately after,

54
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:00,470
so there's this weird kind of.

55
00:02:01,483 --> 00:02:03,984
misconception of like, what is this and how does it work?

56
00:02:04,764 --> 00:02:05,785
If you're familiar with substance,

57
00:02:05,805 --> 00:02:07,886
which most people here are, that's proceduralism.

58
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:10,307
So it's basically you're writing little algorithms

59
00:02:10,807 --> 00:02:11,588
to make content.

60
00:02:12,028 --> 00:02:13,208
And that's the simplest of it.

61
00:02:13,248 --> 00:02:15,730
Like I would even consider auto-rigging proceduralism

62
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,371
because you're basically just writing procedures

63
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:19,771
to build content at the end of it.

64
00:02:20,592 --> 00:02:21,872
So this is a couple of examples.

65
00:02:21,932 --> 00:02:22,573
So Brad Smith.

66
00:02:23,287 --> 00:02:24,929
He's an awesome artist, used to be a Naughty Dog,

67
00:02:24,969 --> 00:02:26,690
now it's at Epic, and then he just does a bunch

68
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,591
of substance designer stuff, and yeah,

69
00:02:28,631 --> 00:02:30,913
we're building art with these little node networks

70
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:32,254
to kind of make content.

71
00:02:32,674 --> 00:02:35,056
And then Magnus Larsson does the same thing,

72
00:02:35,096 --> 00:02:37,498
but instead of using 2D, he does it in 3D.

73
00:02:38,018 --> 00:02:39,199
And that's where Houdini comes in.

74
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:40,740
It's the same kind of workflow,

75
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,641
it's just you're working with nodes,

76
00:02:42,681 --> 00:02:44,062
but instead of doing 2D operations,

77
00:02:44,082 --> 00:02:45,083
you're doing 3D operations.

78
00:02:46,344 --> 00:02:47,785
So this is the only Houdini.

79
00:02:48,453 --> 00:02:51,174
slide that I'll show just for people that are not familiar what it is.

80
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:55,456
The same operations that you would have in any other software like extrusion,

81
00:02:55,916 --> 00:03:01,037
creating primitives, beveling, so it's all basically nodes that you just drop down

82
00:03:01,257 --> 00:03:04,618
and then you would use it like you would. And then the nice thing is that it's

83
00:03:04,658 --> 00:03:06,499
non-destructive because of the procedural nature.

84
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,120
So you can kind of go back up to the level, the top level, change the input and

85
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,961
then everything would just kind of calculate itself and update it. So here I

86
00:03:13,981 --> 00:03:15,042
just have a simple sphere.

87
00:03:15,508 --> 00:03:17,270
and then I have a cube that I can kind of

88
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,812
boolean them together, move them around,

89
00:03:18,872 --> 00:03:20,634
and then at any point I can go into that chain

90
00:03:20,694 --> 00:03:21,735
and then change the inputs.

91
00:03:22,596 --> 00:03:24,778
So this is a super, super basic tool,

92
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:27,601
but you get the idea of if you're kind of familiar

93
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:30,304
with what Substance is to Photoshop,

94
00:03:30,984 --> 00:03:33,327
Houdini is to any other kind of 3D software app.

95
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:35,088
So at least now you guys have some context

96
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:36,290
of what I'm talking about.

97
00:03:37,191 --> 00:03:38,011
The other thing too is,

98
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,244
There's different types of proceduralism.

99
00:03:40,284 --> 00:03:41,765
That's where some of the confusion comes from.

100
00:03:41,866 --> 00:03:43,587
So there's like offline proceduralism,

101
00:03:43,607 --> 00:03:45,149
which is like the Substance and Houdini thing

102
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:46,951
that like basically we're building things offline

103
00:03:46,971 --> 00:03:48,312
and then we're just baking static meshes

104
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,273
that go into a game engine.

105
00:03:49,714 --> 00:03:50,995
There's load time proceduralism,

106
00:03:51,015 --> 00:03:51,996
which is kind of like Minecraft.

107
00:03:52,036 --> 00:03:53,838
That's like while the game is loading,

108
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:55,921
things will get generated and then they'll get baked down

109
00:03:55,961 --> 00:03:56,742
into static content.

110
00:03:57,148 --> 00:03:58,709
And then there's runtime proceduralism,

111
00:03:58,749 --> 00:04:00,710
which is kind of like the Vive and the Tilt Brush

112
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,450
to where people are sweeping curves,

113
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,151
and then as they're moving their hands,

114
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:06,511
a proceduralist kind of taking that curve input

115
00:04:06,531 --> 00:04:07,712
and then doing things to it

116
00:04:07,752 --> 00:04:08,892
and placing a ribbon around it.

117
00:04:09,632 --> 00:04:11,933
For this talk, I'm gonna focus mainly on the offline,

118
00:04:12,373 --> 00:04:13,993
because I feel that's the most relevant

119
00:04:14,113 --> 00:04:15,754
for kind of game development as a whole.

120
00:04:16,434 --> 00:04:18,395
Sure, some people might be already

121
00:04:18,455 --> 00:04:20,936
kind of going into the runtime and the load time,

122
00:04:20,976 --> 00:04:23,076
but for like 90% of the population,

123
00:04:23,116 --> 00:04:24,337
I think that the trick is just.

124
00:04:24,704 --> 00:04:26,065
how do you automate your pipelines

125
00:04:26,085 --> 00:04:27,527
and how do you make them a little bit faster.

126
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,348
So I'm hoping that out of this talk,

127
00:04:29,388 --> 00:04:31,690
you guys can get at least enough ammunition

128
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,911
to where you can go back to your studio

129
00:04:32,931 --> 00:04:33,912
and be like, hey, this is something

130
00:04:33,932 --> 00:04:35,594
that we should at least think about

131
00:04:35,634 --> 00:04:36,995
and kind of further explore a little bit.

132
00:04:38,296 --> 00:04:39,097
So why should you care?

133
00:04:40,498 --> 00:04:41,138
Do you like crunch?

134
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:43,040
Have you ever crunched?

135
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:45,903
Have you ever lost work because someone came back

136
00:04:45,943 --> 00:04:47,644
and it was like, yeah, the art is final,

137
00:04:47,724 --> 00:04:50,186
but design had changed, we play tested

138
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:50,907
and it played like crap.

139
00:04:51,307 --> 00:04:52,668
So we have to go back and we have to change it.

140
00:04:53,109 --> 00:04:54,450
And then you just have to eat that work

141
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,771
and you just have to rebuild everything.

142
00:04:56,651 --> 00:04:58,072
And then you have to cut stuff

143
00:04:58,092 --> 00:05:00,394
because you just couldn't have enough man cycles

144
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:02,595
to build something because the idea was too big

145
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,236
or there was just way too much work

146
00:05:04,276 --> 00:05:05,037
to be able to pull it off.

147
00:05:05,457 --> 00:05:07,378
So the idea with proceduralism is that then

148
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:08,879
you try to minimize all of those.

149
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:10,160
You're still gonna have crunch probably.

150
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,461
You're still gonna have a little bit of lost work.

151
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:13,582
But the idea is that if you have a kind of

152
00:05:13,622 --> 00:05:15,803
automated pipeline that you can change the input

153
00:05:15,823 --> 00:05:17,184
in the beginning and then kind of have things

154
00:05:17,244 --> 00:05:18,305
funnel way the way through,

155
00:05:18,825 --> 00:05:20,786
ideally you're minimizing all of these problems.

156
00:05:22,313 --> 00:05:24,454
So the first misconception is that procedure content

157
00:05:24,494 --> 00:05:26,514
generation is this weird ball thing that indies do

158
00:05:26,554 --> 00:05:28,414
for rogue-likes with procedural dungeon generation.

159
00:05:29,415 --> 00:05:32,455
Sure, that's also true, but that's not exclusively

160
00:05:32,495 --> 00:05:33,955
what procedural content generation is.

161
00:05:34,456 --> 00:05:36,636
And then on the flip side, people say procedural

162
00:05:36,656 --> 00:05:37,936
content generation is this thing that you need

163
00:05:37,956 --> 00:05:39,876
a whole development team for, so like you have

164
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:42,057
the snowdrop engine that you have like volumes

165
00:05:42,077 --> 00:05:43,877
that you can push and pull and buildings generate

166
00:05:43,897 --> 00:05:45,777
and then the whole cities get generated automatically.

167
00:05:46,618 --> 00:05:48,518
So there's this, they're both true,

168
00:05:48,658 --> 00:05:49,698
but they're also both false.

169
00:05:49,838 --> 00:05:51,638
So the scope is so big.

170
00:05:52,296 --> 00:05:56,438
that don't get too hung up on the definition of it,

171
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,679
just kind of figure out how can I apply this to me,

172
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,780
don't look at too much at what other people are doing,

173
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,101
just use it as inspiration,

174
00:06:02,141 --> 00:06:04,402
but try to kind of frame it in your own problems

175
00:06:04,422 --> 00:06:05,183
that you're trying to solve.

176
00:06:06,423 --> 00:06:08,785
So the usual evolution that I see

177
00:06:08,925 --> 00:06:10,025
in kind of different studios,

178
00:06:10,085 --> 00:06:12,807
and it's kind of fun to see where the stages of development

179
00:06:12,847 --> 00:06:14,347
of kind of adopting proceduralism is,

180
00:06:14,427 --> 00:06:16,268
usually you start with one kind of champion.

181
00:06:16,812 --> 00:06:18,493
that is like, I have a crazy idea,

182
00:06:18,513 --> 00:06:21,515
and I used to say that I have this crack smoking idea

183
00:06:21,535 --> 00:06:22,635
that is just like off the wall,

184
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,637
and I'm gonna pitch this for this whole crazy system,

185
00:06:26,117 --> 00:06:27,778
and then they'll do it, and they'll pull it off.

186
00:06:28,358 --> 00:06:29,879
And then now people start to notice,

187
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:31,680
and they're like, holy, that actually worked.

188
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,281
And then you're gonna have a few people

189
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:34,622
kind of gathering around them and being like,

190
00:06:34,682 --> 00:06:36,443
okay, how did you do that?

191
00:06:36,483 --> 00:06:38,043
Can you build this something slightly different?

192
00:06:38,063 --> 00:06:39,224
Can I use your tools to do it?

193
00:06:39,824 --> 00:06:41,265
And then those people start using it,

194
00:06:41,285 --> 00:06:43,166
and that's gonna be like the badass team of the studio,

195
00:06:43,186 --> 00:06:44,367
and that's the hard problem team.

196
00:06:44,707 --> 00:06:46,228
And they're basically like the wizards.

197
00:06:46,661 --> 00:06:48,963
And then ideally, you'll be able to distill that out

198
00:06:49,504 --> 00:06:51,005
into a production at large.

199
00:06:51,025 --> 00:06:52,486
And that's the really hard part, is basically

200
00:06:52,506 --> 00:06:56,690
kind of going from this kind of small team agile movement

201
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,033
to a big engine deployment kind of level.

202
00:07:01,314 --> 00:07:02,895
So I'm going to go through each of these stages

203
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:04,977
and kind of help you through, at least know

204
00:07:05,037 --> 00:07:06,699
what you're going to run into and kind of how

205
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:08,600
to muscle your way through or just understand

206
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,501
what the problems are going to be.

207
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,203
So we'll start with proof of concept.

208
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,520
So this you're gonna see is a lot like

209
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,760
just regular tool development.

210
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,201
So you just identify the problem,

211
00:07:17,661 --> 00:07:19,681
figure out how to make time to fix the problem,

212
00:07:19,801 --> 00:07:20,661
and then you fix the problem.

213
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:22,822
So how do you identify the problem?

214
00:07:22,962 --> 00:07:23,382
Walk around.

215
00:07:23,682 --> 00:07:25,382
And this is like if you guys are tech artists,

216
00:07:25,402 --> 00:07:28,723
you know, just walk around the tool, the studio,

217
00:07:28,763 --> 00:07:30,783
and figure, like, talk to people, and walk around.

218
00:07:30,803 --> 00:07:32,343
And then the one thing that I would say

219
00:07:32,423 --> 00:07:33,924
is for proceduralism in particular,

220
00:07:34,284 --> 00:07:35,704
find out what's boring and repetitive.

221
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,624
Because I'm gonna talk a little bit about this,

222
00:07:37,684 --> 00:07:39,585
but some people are scared of proceduralism,

223
00:07:39,645 --> 00:07:40,265
and they think that,

224
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,070
that's gonna displace their jobs.

225
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,370
But the idea here is you're taking things

226
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,371
that no one wants to do,

227
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,291
they're kind of just shoveling assets through pipelines,

228
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:50,532
and then all the boring and repetitive things

229
00:07:50,572 --> 00:07:51,592
and all the little bottlenecks

230
00:07:51,612 --> 00:07:53,492
are the perfect candidates to be automated.

231
00:07:53,532 --> 00:07:55,173
Because if something is so repetitive

232
00:07:55,653 --> 00:07:57,533
that basically the artist can just shut off their brain

233
00:07:57,573 --> 00:07:59,774
and then just do, oh, I just, yeah, I click this,

234
00:07:59,794 --> 00:08:01,114
then I click this, then I click this,

235
00:08:01,134 --> 00:08:02,374
and then I move this file to here,

236
00:08:02,434 --> 00:08:03,635
and then I bring this file over here,

237
00:08:04,055 --> 00:08:05,135
that should just be automated,

238
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,735
and that's a perfect candidate for you to hit.

239
00:08:07,995 --> 00:08:09,697
The other thing too is understand the art flow.

240
00:08:09,817 --> 00:08:12,559
So people joke that I say that you have to basically

241
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:14,100
talk to robots, or talk to artists,

242
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,681
and then build robots that will replace them.

243
00:08:16,642 --> 00:08:17,243
That's not true.

244
00:08:17,643 --> 00:08:19,845
But the idea is that you do talk to artists,

245
00:08:19,865 --> 00:08:21,506
and then you figure out what the workflow is,

246
00:08:21,566 --> 00:08:23,367
and then you try to automate as much as possible

247
00:08:23,688 --> 00:08:24,969
while leaving control points.

248
00:08:25,369 --> 00:08:26,610
And that's the key show part,

249
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,352
is that you want to build an automated system,

250
00:08:29,392 --> 00:08:30,693
but you want to leave control

251
00:08:30,853 --> 00:08:31,934
where the artist wants control.

252
00:08:31,994 --> 00:08:33,435
So you need to kind of expose the hooks

253
00:08:33,475 --> 00:08:34,796
to where any point in the pipeline,

254
00:08:34,836 --> 00:08:36,698
they can go in and they feel like they have control.

255
00:08:37,206 --> 00:08:38,627
and then go through the process yourself.

256
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,310
And this is especially good for tech artists

257
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,371
because we can actually do it.

258
00:08:42,431 --> 00:08:44,033
So sometimes with like tools programmers,

259
00:08:44,453 --> 00:08:46,755
they'll just get a list of this is all the stuff

260
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:48,057
that we want and then they'll just go

261
00:08:48,397 --> 00:08:50,019
checklist, checklist, checklist, checklist

262
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:52,161
and just give you the tool and it's like,

263
00:08:52,181 --> 00:08:54,002
yeah, technically it does what I want it to do

264
00:08:54,063 --> 00:08:55,284
but you missed half the point.

265
00:08:56,031 --> 00:08:58,131
I forgot to say that yeah, there's this other pain point.

266
00:08:58,411 --> 00:09:00,192
So if you actually do the process yourself,

267
00:09:00,632 --> 00:09:03,552
you will see that, yeah, no, you guys don't even bother

268
00:09:03,612 --> 00:09:05,833
doing any of this, just like completely hot wire

269
00:09:05,873 --> 00:09:07,833
the whole thing and go from A to B way faster.

270
00:09:09,374 --> 00:09:11,394
This is, it's fun because it is the same process

271
00:09:11,434 --> 00:09:14,274
as a tech artist too, so a little bit, yeah.

272
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:17,775
So the other misconception is that I'm training

273
00:09:17,795 --> 00:09:19,736
my replacement, and this is an actual conversation

274
00:09:19,756 --> 00:09:21,036
that I had with someone too, where I was like,

275
00:09:21,096 --> 00:09:22,756
okay, talk to a designer, how do you build

276
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,736
procedural levels, and then the guy was like,

277
00:09:24,776 --> 00:09:25,157
listen, man.

278
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:30,501
I went to China one time and then I had to train a replacement team to basically,

279
00:09:30,641 --> 00:09:33,722
I came back and then I got laid off because basically I trained my outsourcers.

280
00:09:33,742 --> 00:09:35,443
So I feel like I'm having the same conversation.

281
00:09:36,003 --> 00:09:41,426
And this is not just in the games industry, just like everywhere you hear a lot

282
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:43,407
about automation, we had conversations last night about it.

283
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:47,469
Just know that people are going to have that kind of built-in resentment

284
00:09:47,549 --> 00:09:50,530
and built-in resistance sometimes and you just kind of have to know how to word it.

285
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:51,931
And the way I like to word it is.

286
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:53,590
We don't want to take your job,

287
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,471
we want to make you more productive.

288
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:56,452
That's why we build tools.

289
00:09:56,692 --> 00:09:57,792
And then it's the same way,

290
00:09:57,832 --> 00:09:59,894
but there's a little bit of a mind shift

291
00:09:59,914 --> 00:10:01,274
that needs to happen with people.

292
00:10:01,815 --> 00:10:02,735
With procedural system,

293
00:10:03,115 --> 00:10:04,676
they don't see them necessarily as tools,

294
00:10:04,696 --> 00:10:06,337
they see them as the next step of tools.

295
00:10:06,917 --> 00:10:07,818
So there's a little bit of that.

296
00:10:08,538 --> 00:10:11,319
And then there's this thing as the goldfish paradigm,

297
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:12,200
which kind of ties into that,

298
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,781
which is you will build as much content

299
00:10:14,821 --> 00:10:15,582
as you have time for.

300
00:10:15,742 --> 00:10:17,983
So the goldfish will grow for as much size

301
00:10:18,063 --> 00:10:18,883
as the fish tank is.

302
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,681
So the fact that now we kind of displaced the time

303
00:10:21,741 --> 00:10:22,921
and we made production shorter,

304
00:10:23,262 --> 00:10:24,662
that just means you're going to build more content.

305
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:26,743
And then sure, maybe down the line,

306
00:10:26,763 --> 00:10:28,364
you're going to get someone greedy that's going to see it

307
00:10:28,424 --> 00:10:30,245
and be like, oh, I can make a game in six months.

308
00:10:30,265 --> 00:10:31,746
That means I'm going to make 10 games a year

309
00:10:31,786 --> 00:10:32,666
with a bunch of teams.

310
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:34,867
That's technically, yeah, that could happen,

311
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:37,008
but that's not what we're aiming for.

312
00:10:37,048 --> 00:10:37,969
We're just aiming for,

313
00:10:38,309 --> 00:10:39,790
you still have the regular game cycle,

314
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,371
but you're building more content, better games,

315
00:10:42,531 --> 00:10:43,852
more fulfilling experiences,

316
00:10:44,532 --> 00:10:47,313
and ideally you're changing the things in the beginning,

317
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:47,753
so you're like,

318
00:10:48,277 --> 00:10:50,599
alleviating the crunch, and you're kind of making

319
00:10:50,619 --> 00:10:52,300
the ideas kind of stick a little bit better.

320
00:10:52,821 --> 00:10:54,542
And that's really the true goal for it,

321
00:10:54,582 --> 00:10:56,824
but like any kind of tool, you can take it for good

322
00:10:56,844 --> 00:10:57,685
or you can take it for bad.

323
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,287
So the first example I want to talk about

324
00:11:00,307 --> 00:11:02,929
is basically the simplest kind of tool

325
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:04,570
that I could come up with, which is making

326
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,731
baseboards and crowd molding.

327
00:11:06,311 --> 00:11:08,333
So the usual workflow is you would go

328
00:11:08,373 --> 00:11:10,535
and you Google baseboards, and then you find out

329
00:11:10,575 --> 00:11:12,456
the profile that you want, and then you're like,

330
00:11:12,496 --> 00:11:14,578
okay, cool, I like those, and then I want to try

331
00:11:14,618 --> 00:11:17,180
to build this for my game, and then you bring it in,

332
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:17,600
and then you.

333
00:11:18,642 --> 00:11:20,643
bring in the image and then you go with the trace tool

334
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:23,285
and you go boom, boom, boom, and you start to kind of going

335
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:25,767
and then nobody got time for that.

336
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,328
This is just a giant waste of time.

337
00:11:28,849 --> 00:11:31,070
So the first change I would do is I would look

338
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,011
at manufacturer specs.

339
00:11:32,031 --> 00:11:33,652
So like a lot of these things that we're building

340
00:11:33,712 --> 00:11:34,593
is out in the real world.

341
00:11:34,633 --> 00:11:36,614
So you can just go directly to the manufacturer

342
00:11:37,014 --> 00:11:39,256
and get the exact specs that you need.

343
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,231
and then you would do, instead of tracing things by hand,

344
00:11:42,251 --> 00:11:44,452
you would build a trace node that we have,

345
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:47,292
and then you just build the line, and then you sweep it,

346
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:48,693
and now you have the same kind of tool

347
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:50,213
that would do the same workflow.

348
00:11:50,273 --> 00:11:51,513
And because it's procedurally,

349
00:11:52,293 --> 00:11:53,954
instead of every time you need to make a change

350
00:11:53,974 --> 00:11:55,394
or every time you need to make a variation,

351
00:11:56,314 --> 00:11:59,195
you just have a system that you don't have to go

352
00:11:59,255 --> 00:12:00,916
and kind of fudge the points by hand again.

353
00:12:00,936 --> 00:12:02,296
You just kind of feed it more things,

354
00:12:02,496 --> 00:12:04,777
and then the system would just kind of go and make things,

355
00:12:05,577 --> 00:12:07,497
which is a better way of working, in my opinion.

356
00:12:08,298 --> 00:12:09,378
So now you have this kind of.

357
00:12:10,317 --> 00:12:11,338
procedural straight line.

358
00:12:11,718 --> 00:12:15,261
For this stuff, we want corners, right?

359
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:18,403
So we want the kind of concave and convex versions of it

360
00:12:18,443 --> 00:12:19,864
so we can make a modular set out of it.

361
00:12:20,305 --> 00:12:21,826
And then again, the worst case scenario

362
00:12:22,046 --> 00:12:24,668
is someone would just put two of them together

363
00:12:24,728 --> 00:12:26,770
and then vert weld them hand by hand,

364
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,031
and then they'll kind of fudge them

365
00:12:28,071 --> 00:12:29,492
and then kind of get it aligned.

366
00:12:30,352 --> 00:12:31,433
Again, nobody got time for that.

367
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:36,171
So the way I like to do it is actually clip it.

368
00:12:36,271 --> 00:12:37,671
So it's kind of like a real operation

369
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:39,072
that's like you just mitered the thing.

370
00:12:39,152 --> 00:12:40,473
So you just cut it at 45 and then 45

371
00:12:40,513 --> 00:12:42,314
and then you shove them both together.

372
00:12:42,794 --> 00:12:44,916
Some people, even on some of the comments,

373
00:12:45,036 --> 00:12:46,837
is you wanna sweep it along a curve.

374
00:12:47,337 --> 00:12:49,578
The problem with that is that that's not generic enough.

375
00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:51,500
So you could do it with just like a,

376
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,080
instead of sweeping it along a straight line,

377
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,621
you sweep it across a 90 degree angle.

378
00:12:55,062 --> 00:12:57,823
But then if you have any kind of minute variations

379
00:12:57,863 --> 00:12:59,224
or if you wanna build a general system,

380
00:12:59,244 --> 00:13:01,325
which I'm gonna talk a little bit further down the line.

381
00:13:02,011 --> 00:13:03,752
A mitering approach is a little bit better

382
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:04,932
and more kind of general purpose.

383
00:13:05,132 --> 00:13:07,052
So keep that in mind,

384
00:13:07,092 --> 00:13:08,353
towards like if you're building something,

385
00:13:08,393 --> 00:13:10,373
if you can extrapolate that to the next level

386
00:13:10,593 --> 00:13:12,814
of how this can be useful for another thing

387
00:13:12,954 --> 00:13:14,735
and not just for the one problem I'm trying to solve,

388
00:13:15,355 --> 00:13:15,815
that's helpful.

389
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:17,775
So now I have a full set.

390
00:13:17,815 --> 00:13:19,296
So now I basically have a baseboard

391
00:13:19,616 --> 00:13:21,477
with a concave corner and a convex corner.

392
00:13:21,957 --> 00:13:23,417
And then because it's non-destructive,

393
00:13:23,717 --> 00:13:25,538
I can just feed any input into it

394
00:13:25,878 --> 00:13:27,998
and then I just get the whole set.

395
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,519
So this is by far like,

396
00:13:31,367 --> 00:13:32,467
the argument that's like,

397
00:13:32,527 --> 00:13:34,348
oh, it doesn't take me too long to trace a curve, right?

398
00:13:34,388 --> 00:13:36,469
It's just like, a couple of hours, I'll go in,

399
00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:38,110
and it's like, yeah, but you could do it in seconds.

400
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,271
And then the idea is like,

401
00:13:39,931 --> 00:13:41,892
the next step is instead of feeding one input,

402
00:13:41,972 --> 00:13:43,793
we just feed a sheet of inputs.

403
00:13:43,873 --> 00:13:47,195
And now, any tool or any asset that you need to build,

404
00:13:47,295 --> 00:13:49,537
you just kind of run it through the pipeline,

405
00:13:49,557 --> 00:13:51,278
and you just have like infinite number of assets.

406
00:13:51,538 --> 00:13:52,878
Basically, but it's still art directed,

407
00:13:52,918 --> 00:13:53,619
it's still controlled,

408
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,680
it still fit what you want it to look like.

409
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,441
But all of the kind of boring, little repetitive work

410
00:13:58,982 --> 00:13:59,722
is just kind of gone.

411
00:14:01,763 --> 00:14:03,945
So now you have a tool and then maybe you make this tool

412
00:14:03,965 --> 00:14:05,005
or maybe you make something else.

413
00:14:05,065 --> 00:14:06,787
And then it's like people start to notice

414
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,689
and the way it usually works is you'll make a tool

415
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:11,010
and then you just use it yourself

416
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,511
because it's so fast that you'll be like,

417
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:13,712
you're the guy and then it's like,

418
00:14:13,732 --> 00:14:15,333
hey, do you need a baseboard?

419
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,255
You just ask me the baseboards, feed me the thing,

420
00:14:17,275 --> 00:14:18,396
I'll just run it through my system

421
00:14:18,436 --> 00:14:20,337
and then I'll spit it out for you and it takes no time.

422
00:14:21,258 --> 00:14:22,979
But ideally you wanna kind of diffuse that out

423
00:14:22,999 --> 00:14:25,021
because then you become a bottleneck yourself

424
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:26,202
and you kinda wanna displace that.

425
00:14:26,222 --> 00:14:27,663
You wanna make the tools easy enough

426
00:14:27,683 --> 00:14:28,484
for other people to use.

427
00:14:30,943 --> 00:14:32,884
then you're gonna start basically building tools

428
00:14:32,904 --> 00:14:34,565
for other people, but the problem with building tools

429
00:14:34,585 --> 00:14:36,966
for other people is that you have to convince

430
00:14:37,006 --> 00:14:38,787
the kind of task keepers and the producers

431
00:14:39,687 --> 00:14:41,188
that it is worth spending the time,

432
00:14:41,228 --> 00:14:43,089
and now it needs to be a little bit more robust,

433
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:45,069
and you have to kind of encapsulate the problem a little bit.

434
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:47,110
You can't just have like this hacky tool

435
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,491
that you just know where all the inputs are.

436
00:14:48,511 --> 00:14:50,392
You kind of have to kind of extrapolate it up a level.

437
00:14:50,812 --> 00:14:53,513
Again, much like regular tool development.

438
00:14:54,537 --> 00:14:55,818
The one thing that I will say is,

439
00:14:56,319 --> 00:14:57,800
don't argue for time, just show it.

440
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,922
There will always be people saying that it can't be done.

441
00:15:01,102 --> 00:15:02,583
There's always, always gonna be people

442
00:15:02,643 --> 00:15:04,124
that's saying they can do it faster by hand.

443
00:15:05,265 --> 00:15:07,326
If you believe strongly on it, just do it.

444
00:15:07,346 --> 00:15:08,567
So I had a great example.

445
00:15:09,188 --> 00:15:10,488
I used to work in a previous company

446
00:15:10,528 --> 00:15:11,889
and we just had like head topologies

447
00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:13,931
and we had like 200 heads that we needed

448
00:15:13,951 --> 00:15:16,052
to change the topology on and there was a big argument

449
00:15:16,072 --> 00:15:17,233
whether or not that was worth doing.

450
00:15:17,994 --> 00:15:19,755
And I was like, well, if we change to another head,

451
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:21,036
then we're in line with other studios

452
00:15:21,076 --> 00:15:22,077
and they give us better tools.

453
00:15:22,437 --> 00:15:23,858
But the argument was like, well, there's gonna be like,

454
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,151
It's like 200 heads, it's gonna take you like two man weeks

455
00:15:27,171 --> 00:15:29,071
to kinda go and re-topologize all of them,

456
00:15:29,111 --> 00:15:30,572
and it's just like, it's not worth the time.

457
00:15:31,032 --> 00:15:32,812
The real problem was like a political thing,

458
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:34,793
so it was kinda being disguised,

459
00:15:34,813 --> 00:15:38,193
so one of the guys, Johnny, who's a Houdini wizard over at EA,

460
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:39,734
basically he just went and was like,

461
00:15:39,774 --> 00:15:40,834
I just wrote a script overnight,

462
00:15:41,294 --> 00:15:42,294
and I just batched all the heads,

463
00:15:42,594 --> 00:15:43,574
and now the problem is gone.

464
00:15:43,954 --> 00:15:45,475
And it's like, the next time we went to the meeting,

465
00:15:45,515 --> 00:15:47,095
they were like, okay, well, this is gonna take forever,

466
00:15:47,115 --> 00:15:47,935
and it's like, no, it's not just done.

467
00:15:48,723 --> 00:15:50,565
And then the real problem like surfaced that it's like,

468
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:51,465
oh, they don't want to change it.

469
00:15:51,505 --> 00:15:53,467
It wasn't because of the tool or the time,

470
00:15:53,587 --> 00:15:54,788
it was because of some other reason.

471
00:15:55,169 --> 00:15:57,531
But kind of being able to just do it by yourself

472
00:15:57,611 --> 00:15:59,953
and being like just take out the whole middle layer

473
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:03,997
of argument and there's no time and it's worth doing.

474
00:16:04,077 --> 00:16:06,679
And a little bit of the ask for forgiveness

475
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,241
and not permission kind of applies here.

476
00:16:09,061 --> 00:16:09,862
The other thing too is that.

477
00:16:10,575 --> 00:16:11,515
Build a little prototype.

478
00:16:11,535 --> 00:16:14,056
A lot of these tools can be built with very simple nodes,

479
00:16:14,096 --> 00:16:15,656
and you can do a proof of concept

480
00:16:15,716 --> 00:16:16,156
and then show it.

481
00:16:16,536 --> 00:16:19,297
If you can't, look at examples of people doing it.

482
00:16:19,337 --> 00:16:21,317
There's a lot of people doing proceduralism now.

483
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,078
So there's a lot of talks from EA.

484
00:16:24,098 --> 00:16:25,638
They have a great stuff on SSX, how

485
00:16:25,658 --> 00:16:27,539
they built the whole mountain generation system.

486
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,359
There's a lot of stuff of Uncharted,

487
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:31,560
how they're doing procedural destruction

488
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,880
and using Houdini for that stuff.

489
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,220
And then there's, yeah, just go out and then

490
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,561
see generally what you're trying to do.

491
00:16:37,641 --> 00:16:39,601
And there's a lot of resources, either on GDC,

492
00:16:39,661 --> 00:16:40,262
at SIGGRAPH.

493
00:16:40,852 --> 00:16:41,832
or on our website.

494
00:16:42,973 --> 00:16:46,316
The other way to approach pitching tools

495
00:16:46,536 --> 00:16:47,296
is your buying time.

496
00:16:47,496 --> 00:16:49,137
And this is kind of a weird mind thing

497
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:52,460
because if you say, hey, I need, whatever, $5,000

498
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,181
to buy this piece of software,

499
00:16:54,922 --> 00:16:56,242
but that's gonna save you a lot of time,

500
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:59,665
people don't see that as, like on a budgeting mindset,

501
00:16:59,745 --> 00:17:00,846
it's like people are free

502
00:17:01,246 --> 00:17:02,607
because I'm already paying for people.

503
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,429
So I don't wanna pay this much money

504
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:06,410
that will give me.

505
00:17:07,002 --> 00:17:10,524
theoretically, like x more people that are just production, like man time.

506
00:17:11,145 --> 00:17:15,388
It's a weird kind of like non-logical argument that you have to have.

507
00:17:16,048 --> 00:17:17,969
But just try to pitch it as time.

508
00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:20,271
It's like you're not buying software for

509
00:17:20,311 --> 00:17:22,132
then you need more people to write the software.

510
00:17:22,412 --> 00:17:25,855
You're just buying the software that can just automate the whole process.

511
00:17:25,955 --> 00:17:28,016
Or you're building the software, not necessarily buying, but

512
00:17:28,056 --> 00:17:30,198
the time that you're using to build it.

513
00:17:31,198 --> 00:17:33,379
The other thing, too, is like, get the buy-ins from the team.

514
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,759
So the worst thing you can do is come up

515
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:38,860
with a cool idea about how the terrain system should be built,

516
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,361
and then you go and you try to shove it down the terrain team's

517
00:17:41,381 --> 00:17:41,661
throat.

518
00:17:42,121 --> 00:17:43,141
That's never going to work.

519
00:17:43,181 --> 00:17:44,441
Sometimes you can muscle through it,

520
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,222
and sometimes you get some people that are like, oh, yeah,

521
00:17:46,322 --> 00:17:47,002
I can see the light.

522
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,182
90% of the time, you need to kind of work

523
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:50,723
with them throughout the whole process

524
00:17:50,783 --> 00:17:53,583
and kind of get buy-in from them as you're developing the tool

525
00:17:53,623 --> 00:17:54,684
so then they feel vested in it.

526
00:17:55,064 --> 00:17:57,764
Otherwise, they're just like, even if the tool is good,

527
00:17:57,804 --> 00:17:59,005
and it's better, and it's faster.

528
00:17:59,628 --> 00:18:02,029
just a logical argument of like, I didn't build it,

529
00:18:02,109 --> 00:18:03,989
I don't know who did this, it's not good enough

530
00:18:04,009 --> 00:18:05,090
because I didn't come up with it.

531
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,931
And those are, again, in the kind of argument land,

532
00:18:08,991 --> 00:18:11,131
it's subtle differences, but you're gonna run into it.

533
00:18:11,171 --> 00:18:12,551
And I know tech artists, me personally,

534
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:14,512
very logical, very just like, hey,

535
00:18:14,772 --> 00:18:16,312
just clearly this is more efficient,

536
00:18:16,352 --> 00:18:17,212
we should just use this.

537
00:18:17,753 --> 00:18:18,733
And then people are like,

538
00:18:18,753 --> 00:18:21,033
you get kind of more emotional arguments with it.

539
00:18:21,973 --> 00:18:23,054
The other thing to say is like,

540
00:18:23,834 --> 00:18:25,094
to show how fast people can do it.

541
00:18:25,634 --> 00:18:27,395
I've showed some tools to some clients and they're like,

542
00:18:28,887 --> 00:18:31,808
This just shows me that we're working way too slow.

543
00:18:32,349 --> 00:18:33,649
And then just looking at some of these tools,

544
00:18:33,689 --> 00:18:35,270
is like see people just like drawing curves

545
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,230
and then the whole city's applied.

546
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,551
And it's like, Jesus Christ,

547
00:18:37,571 --> 00:18:39,652
we're placing parking meters by hand.

548
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:40,893
And we've did that in games.

549
00:18:40,993 --> 00:18:43,214
It's like, why?

550
00:18:43,234 --> 00:18:45,034
It's like, yeah, but I need control

551
00:18:45,054 --> 00:18:46,095
of where the parking meters are

552
00:18:46,155 --> 00:18:47,516
because of the way it's framed.

553
00:18:47,536 --> 00:18:48,676
It's like, no, you don't.

554
00:18:48,716 --> 00:18:49,156
Just please.

555
00:18:50,287 --> 00:18:51,707
Just see how fast you can do it.

556
00:18:51,747 --> 00:18:53,128
And then people are going to be like, well,

557
00:18:53,168 --> 00:18:54,768
placing a parking meter is just really fast.

558
00:18:54,828 --> 00:18:55,828
I can do it super fast.

559
00:18:55,848 --> 00:18:57,848
I can just click it, and then I'll drag, I'll drag,

560
00:18:57,868 --> 00:18:58,449
I'll drag, I'll drag.

561
00:18:58,469 --> 00:18:59,689
And it's like, yeah, but if you want change

562
00:18:59,729 --> 00:19:02,149
and if the street moved, now you have either floating parking

563
00:19:02,189 --> 00:19:04,210
meters you have to go in, and every time someone changes it,

564
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,870
you have to go and update it.

565
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,210
So there's a little bit of that.

566
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,310
Again, like, oh, it just takes me five minutes,

567
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,611
but it shouldn't take you any time.

568
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:14,551
Those little five minutes is what bleeds production dry.

569
00:19:14,591 --> 00:19:16,952
It's not like the big tools that take months.

570
00:19:16,992 --> 00:19:18,292
The big tools that take months usually

571
00:19:18,332 --> 00:19:19,652
are the things that kind of solve production.

572
00:19:20,093 --> 00:19:22,475
The little paper cuts is what kind of destroys you.

573
00:19:23,656 --> 00:19:26,800
The second example that I'll go into is this pipe tool.

574
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,741
And this is basically like something

575
00:19:28,761 --> 00:19:30,123
that you want to hand off to an artist

576
00:19:30,163 --> 00:19:32,125
and you want to kind of extrapolate things out a little bit

577
00:19:32,165 --> 00:19:35,388
and then you just, now you have a tool

578
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,610
that you just take a curve and then you get a pipe out of it

579
00:19:38,031 --> 00:19:40,853
and this is kind of just a traditional problem that you have.

580
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:43,236
The thing I have is you want to break down

581
00:19:43,276 --> 00:19:44,037
the problem a little bit.

582
00:19:44,782 --> 00:19:45,743
So you want to take the curve.

583
00:19:45,763 --> 00:19:47,504
You want to understand how that workflow is

584
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:50,026
and how you would come up with the solution for it.

585
00:19:50,046 --> 00:19:52,548
So the way I would come up with this is you take the curve

586
00:19:52,588 --> 00:19:54,489
input, and then you would separate the corners

587
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:55,090
from the straights.

588
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,551
And then you would build the straights,

589
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:57,471
and then you would build the corners,

590
00:19:57,511 --> 00:19:58,432
and then you assemble it together,

591
00:19:58,452 --> 00:19:58,952
and you have a pipe.

592
00:19:59,193 --> 00:20:01,534
So fairly straightforward workflow.

593
00:20:02,255 --> 00:20:04,617
So let's go that step by step.

594
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:05,898
So you start with the curve as an input.

595
00:20:06,678 --> 00:20:09,100
As a nice bonus, another thing that people like to do

596
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,422
is align curves to surfaces, which

597
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:12,603
is a giant waste of time.

598
00:20:13,531 --> 00:20:15,852
So basically what I like to do is you take the curves

599
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,453
and then you take the first and last points

600
00:20:17,473 --> 00:20:18,814
and then you project it into the surface

601
00:20:18,834 --> 00:20:20,955
that you're gonna do it, get the surface normals out,

602
00:20:21,015 --> 00:20:22,856
and then you stitch that back into the curve.

603
00:20:23,297 --> 00:20:25,738
So now the kind of connections are always gonna be perfect

604
00:20:26,178 --> 00:20:28,680
because that's the giant most waste of time thing

605
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,360
that I've ever seen.

606
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,362
But it's one of those that's like, we don't know what's,

607
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:34,443
like I just came up with this and it's like,

608
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,024
we don't know what's out there

609
00:20:36,044 --> 00:20:37,044
and we don't know how to fix it,

610
00:20:37,084 --> 00:20:38,285
so we don't know what problems we have.

611
00:20:39,145 --> 00:20:40,706
Then we wanna separate the straight from the corners.

612
00:20:40,726 --> 00:20:41,627
This is very straightforward.

613
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:42,387
Basically you just take.

614
00:20:42,952 --> 00:20:46,294
each line segment and then you kind of like carve them a little bit so you kind of spread

615
00:20:46,314 --> 00:20:51,576
them out a little bit and now you have basically the two kind of problem sets isolated and

616
00:20:51,596 --> 00:20:52,397
then you model a pipe.

617
00:20:52,537 --> 00:20:59,220
So the way I model a pipe in that example is you take a cylinder and then you sweep

618
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,963
a circle through a line and then you put two cylinders at the end of it and then I made

619
00:21:03,983 --> 00:21:09,305
some little BS screws that just look like something and then you merge the long kind

620
00:21:09,345 --> 00:21:09,385
of.

621
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:13,402
pipe part of it with the kind of end caps with it and then you do a little bit of a beveling at the

622
00:21:13,422 --> 00:21:18,926
end of it. So not fancy but really really basic modeling but it kind of from a far away it kind

623
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:20,227
of looks and that's the other thing too that's like

624
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,940
If you talk to an artist, they'll be like,

625
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,281
oh no, I will bring this into ZBrush

626
00:21:24,341 --> 00:21:28,802
and manually do the welding and all this other thing.

627
00:21:28,882 --> 00:21:31,143
It's like, yeah, but then there's this little tiny pipe

628
00:21:31,183 --> 00:21:32,823
on the corner of the ceiling that no one's gonna see.

629
00:21:33,363 --> 00:21:34,664
Does it need that much attention?

630
00:21:34,764 --> 00:21:36,564
Sometimes, yeah, and then that's the part

631
00:21:36,584 --> 00:21:37,525
that you kinda have to go through,

632
00:21:37,565 --> 00:21:39,105
is do you build something procedurally,

633
00:21:39,145 --> 00:21:40,946
or then you give that freedom back to the artist

634
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,546
and be like, okay, fine, just build the pipes,

635
00:21:43,026 --> 00:21:46,387
give me the pipe pieces, and then I'll manually place those.

636
00:21:47,027 --> 00:21:48,048
So those are the two approaches.

637
00:21:48,795 --> 00:21:55,397
So then I'll just place those, just take each of those little side light segments that I did and then I would run it through the little pipe generator too,

638
00:21:55,857 --> 00:22:00,438
that just kind of extrudes the main cylinder and puts the two things at the end and then does the beveling.

639
00:22:00,998 --> 00:22:07,320
And then the corner is actually the same tool, because you just have something that sweeps the circle along the curve and then you put two caps at the end of it,

640
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,801
and then you add the little screws to it.

641
00:22:10,261 --> 00:22:16,442
So now you're done, and you have a tool that is kind of fairly straightforward, fairly logical, anyone should be able to go in and do it.

642
00:22:17,147 --> 00:22:18,648
but now you have this kind of cool system

643
00:22:18,668 --> 00:22:19,949
that is like just pipes are solved.

644
00:22:20,249 --> 00:22:21,930
And now for your production of the rest of the game,

645
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:24,311
it's like you can be the pipe guy,

646
00:22:24,391 --> 00:22:26,173
or ideally you hand this off to the artist

647
00:22:26,253 --> 00:22:28,534
where you just be like, okay, here's your pipe tool,

648
00:22:28,594 --> 00:22:31,236
just draw as many curves as your heart desires,

649
00:22:31,696 --> 00:22:33,177
and then you just run this through this tool,

650
00:22:33,217 --> 00:22:35,198
and then you have all the pipes you need.

651
00:22:36,639 --> 00:22:38,700
So in the last stage, which is the hard stage,

652
00:22:38,761 --> 00:22:41,722
is now you kind of have, maybe you did this pipe tool,

653
00:22:41,742 --> 00:22:43,323
and maybe like five environment artists use it,

654
00:22:43,343 --> 00:22:44,144
and that's all you need,

655
00:22:44,164 --> 00:22:45,265
you don't have that many pipes in your game.

656
00:22:45,714 --> 00:22:50,618
But now you're trying to build these kind of like larger systems like a building generator or like a room generator.

657
00:22:50,938 --> 00:22:56,022
How do you get into that? So the way I like to think of it is basically you have this in connected subsystems

658
00:22:56,603 --> 00:22:59,906
And I used to have a friend that any problem that you ask him he'd be like, you know, man

659
00:22:59,926 --> 00:23:06,271
The spaceship is a complex problem. There's a lot of moving parts. It's not like you you can't just it's it's it's it's complicated

660
00:23:06,912 --> 00:23:07,852
But kind of try to feed

661
00:23:08,773 --> 00:23:10,435
What that critical path is and know what?

662
00:23:11,092 --> 00:23:12,853
You're starting over here, you need to get over there,

663
00:23:13,174 --> 00:23:15,235
build little milestones of failure points

664
00:23:15,255 --> 00:23:16,977
that you can abort, but then kind of know

665
00:23:17,057 --> 00:23:19,760
what's the minimum viable product that you need to build,

666
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,342
like any other tool, but it applies very much so

667
00:23:22,362 --> 00:23:24,364
to proceduralism.

668
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,786
The idea here too is that if you kind of know

669
00:23:26,826 --> 00:23:29,108
what the whole pipeline, you can just selectively

670
00:23:29,168 --> 00:23:31,591
replace pieces of the pipeline with proceduralism,

671
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,593
and then leave the kind of things that are a little bit

672
00:23:33,633 --> 00:23:35,334
more close to people's heart, or things that people

673
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:35,755
want to do.

674
00:23:36,394 --> 00:23:37,895
And then you still keep the eye on the prize.

675
00:23:37,955 --> 00:23:39,756
So you might be like, yeah, I built you a pipe tool,

676
00:23:40,116 --> 00:23:42,378
but that pipe tool is gonna tie with the cable tool,

677
00:23:42,639 --> 00:23:43,920
which is gonna tie to the room tool,

678
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,861
which is gonna tie to the city tool.

679
00:23:46,562 --> 00:23:48,103
So you kind of start with little pieces,

680
00:23:48,143 --> 00:23:49,424
but kind of keep an eye on the prize

681
00:23:49,464 --> 00:23:51,406
and kind of know where you're gonna go.

682
00:23:51,446 --> 00:23:53,587
The other approach for this is that there is no plan B.

683
00:23:54,148 --> 00:23:55,449
And we either do it or we fail.

684
00:23:56,109 --> 00:23:58,751
And that's a bold move, but it works sometimes.

685
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,313
So Caleb Howard from EA was like,

686
00:24:00,353 --> 00:24:02,174
when we did SSX, we needed to do 300 tracks.

687
00:24:03,464 --> 00:24:05,085
We either did 300 tracks or we failed.

688
00:24:05,185 --> 00:24:06,085
We couldn't do this by hand.

689
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:08,486
The problem was so big that if proceduralism didn't work,

690
00:24:08,926 --> 00:24:09,926
we would just not ship the game.

691
00:24:10,486 --> 00:24:11,807
And that's the opposition.

692
00:24:12,107 --> 00:24:13,848
And then that puts a little bit of,

693
00:24:14,308 --> 00:24:15,688
what I like to say, the panic threshold,

694
00:24:16,328 --> 00:24:17,689
which producers will start to,

695
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,910
because procedural systems aren't like regular art

696
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:23,131
that's just like, every week I make five widgets,

697
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:25,412
and then I can see five widgets being built every week.

698
00:24:25,732 --> 00:24:27,312
And then if a week, five widgets weren't built,

699
00:24:27,352 --> 00:24:28,413
I know that I dipped a little bit.

700
00:24:28,673 --> 00:24:30,573
Proceduralism is like, okay, I don't have anything,

701
00:24:31,294 --> 00:24:32,614
and then I have a thousand widgets.

702
00:24:33,218 --> 00:24:35,419
and then that panic kind of goes away.

703
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:36,580
But then it didn't work,

704
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,541
and then the widgets need to change somehow,

705
00:24:38,641 --> 00:24:40,082
and then the panic starts to creep back up,

706
00:24:40,802 --> 00:24:43,824
and then finally the widgets work,

707
00:24:43,864 --> 00:24:45,145
and then the panic kind of goes away,

708
00:24:45,185 --> 00:24:46,546
and then the thing system is stable,

709
00:24:46,606 --> 00:24:48,046
and people kind of,

710
00:24:48,407 --> 00:24:48,927
but know that,

711
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:52,989
and it's uncomfortable to kind of be in those meetings,

712
00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:53,610
because people are like,

713
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:55,591
hey, what's happening with this thing?

714
00:24:55,611 --> 00:24:57,332
It's like, it's coming, it's really close,

715
00:24:57,392 --> 00:24:58,092
and it's like, how close?

716
00:24:58,132 --> 00:24:58,813
It's like, I don't know.

717
00:24:59,373 --> 00:24:59,653
It's like,

718
00:25:02,263 --> 00:25:05,404
It's like I'll keep building it and then I'll keep hitting another wall and then

719
00:25:05,444 --> 00:25:08,166
I'll go through that wall and then I'll go to the next wall and at one point

720
00:25:08,186 --> 00:25:11,727
there's no more walls and it works but until that point happens I can't tell

721
00:25:11,747 --> 00:25:14,088
you and then people get really nervous and they're like well let's start with

722
00:25:14,108 --> 00:25:16,689
plan B and let's start getting some people actually building the widgets by

723
00:25:16,729 --> 00:25:20,631
hand but kind of try to stick with it and kind of try to kind of show them

724
00:25:20,691 --> 00:25:24,873
that it's normal to kind of panic and it's normal to kind of not trust the new

725
00:25:24,913 --> 00:25:25,513
system but

726
00:25:26,114 --> 00:25:27,395
know that other people are doing it

727
00:25:27,435 --> 00:25:29,096
and that it's a proven thing at this point.

728
00:25:29,136 --> 00:25:32,658
It's not like this weird oddball new workflow.

729
00:25:32,718 --> 00:25:34,700
The other misconception is that once it starts working,

730
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,741
people are like, proceduralism everything.

731
00:25:37,001 --> 00:25:37,962
We don't need artists.

732
00:25:38,002 --> 00:25:39,563
Let's make a game with five guys

733
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:41,745
and let's just like, it's like software development

734
00:25:41,765 --> 00:25:42,245
like anything.

735
00:25:42,285 --> 00:25:43,786
So there's gonna be bugs on the design.

736
00:25:43,806 --> 00:25:45,888
There's gonna be things like ambiguity

737
00:25:45,928 --> 00:25:47,469
that an artist said that they needed something

738
00:25:47,509 --> 00:25:48,310
and that they don't have it.

739
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:50,591
Or then you're gonna build this beautiful building tool

740
00:25:50,631 --> 00:25:52,653
and then someone gives you just bad modular sets

741
00:25:53,033 --> 00:25:54,214
that completely break everything.

742
00:25:54,677 --> 00:25:55,497
and then it doesn't work.

743
00:25:55,657 --> 00:25:58,560
So there's no such thing as an off the shelf solution yet,

744
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,481
and that's the part that we kind of need to build

745
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:02,583
as a community, and kind of start getting

746
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:04,284
kind of more standards and kind of building it

747
00:26:04,324 --> 00:26:05,665
to where we get to the point that's like,

748
00:26:06,786 --> 00:26:08,588
everyone wants to build their own procedural system

749
00:26:08,628 --> 00:26:10,809
because there isn't the one building generator

750
00:26:10,829 --> 00:26:13,191
that's like, just works for everybody.

751
00:26:13,431 --> 00:26:14,412
So everybody has their own thing.

752
00:26:14,432 --> 00:26:15,753
It's like, oh, I want to do a Parisian building,

753
00:26:15,773 --> 00:26:17,094
so my buildings are completely different.

754
00:26:17,114 --> 00:26:18,135
I want to do an Old West building,

755
00:26:18,155 --> 00:26:19,036
so it's completely different.

756
00:26:19,436 --> 00:26:21,518
Until someone comes up with the PBR of buildings.

757
00:26:22,008 --> 00:26:23,749
that is like, you just can't mess this up.

758
00:26:23,869 --> 00:26:24,989
You just give it a curve,

759
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:26,530
and then you select which style you want,

760
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,430
and then you get better curves than anything.

761
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,091
And that's I think where Substance did really well,

762
00:26:30,111 --> 00:26:30,671
to where it's just like,

763
00:26:31,412 --> 00:26:33,172
you just have a library of really good materials.

764
00:26:33,552 --> 00:26:34,913
Yeah, you wanna make gold, go make gold,

765
00:26:34,953 --> 00:26:36,353
but the gold that they gave you is pretty good.

766
00:26:36,493 --> 00:26:39,815
So then people start to kinda go down that kinda pedestal

767
00:26:39,835 --> 00:26:41,075
of like, my gold is better than,

768
00:26:41,175 --> 00:26:42,676
and it's like, yeah, do you really wanna spend?

769
00:26:43,661 --> 00:26:45,063
30 hours building a procedural wood,

770
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:47,084
sure, go and spend and do that,

771
00:26:47,124 --> 00:26:49,186
but like 90% of the time you can just find something

772
00:26:49,206 --> 00:26:51,568
that is already done at a quality that you like

773
00:26:51,729 --> 00:26:52,429
and then kind of move on.

774
00:26:54,231 --> 00:26:56,913
So for my final example, I have this modular set,

775
00:26:57,414 --> 00:26:59,375
which is, as you can see, is very similar

776
00:26:59,435 --> 00:27:01,237
to something that I showed earlier today.

777
00:27:02,578 --> 00:27:04,059
But it's kind of like the extrapolation.

778
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,021
So the problem that I have in this one

779
00:27:06,141 --> 00:27:07,923
is I have something that is X size

780
00:27:07,983 --> 00:27:09,825
and I need to fit it in something that is Y size.

781
00:27:10,456 --> 00:27:12,758
And then the way I usually start with it is like,

782
00:27:12,818 --> 00:27:14,359
okay, I'll just place it there,

783
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,261
and then I'll place another one,

784
00:27:16,721 --> 00:27:18,282
and then the way we do it by hand is like,

785
00:27:18,342 --> 00:27:19,263
okay, I have a wall segment,

786
00:27:19,283 --> 00:27:20,604
I'll put wall segment, wall segment,

787
00:27:20,904 --> 00:27:23,106
and then I'll put some weird oddball little corner shape

788
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:25,028
that didn't fit because people didn't really apply

789
00:27:25,048 --> 00:27:27,470
to the grid, or it didn't just kind of fell off,

790
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,732
and now I have this one custom piece

791
00:27:29,752 --> 00:27:30,832
that it's like a weird corner,

792
00:27:31,433 --> 00:27:32,854
and ideally what I would like to do

793
00:27:32,954 --> 00:27:34,255
is I would like the procedural system

794
00:27:34,275 --> 00:27:35,856
to calculate how many

795
00:27:36,623 --> 00:27:38,843
things can I fit there and then distribute the weight

796
00:27:39,123 --> 00:27:41,744
of that scaling slightly by all the pieces.

797
00:27:41,784 --> 00:27:44,225
So then you get a little bit like a 5% squish

798
00:27:44,605 --> 00:27:46,145
on each asset, but it's not noticeable

799
00:27:46,205 --> 00:27:48,666
and you don't have all these weird little custom end caps

800
00:27:48,686 --> 00:27:49,846
that you have to figure out how to do it.

801
00:27:50,806 --> 00:27:51,786
So again, the math of this,

802
00:27:51,966 --> 00:27:53,227
this is the only math of the whole talk.

803
00:27:53,807 --> 00:27:54,847
It's fairly straightforward.

804
00:27:55,187 --> 00:27:57,408
So if you have something that is two wide

805
00:27:57,448 --> 00:27:58,848
and you have something that is one wide,

806
00:27:58,888 --> 00:28:00,888
you put, you figure out what the size needs to be

807
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,029
so you need to multiply it by two.

808
00:28:02,449 --> 00:28:05,029
So that's just like a basic kind of ratio

809
00:28:05,069 --> 00:28:05,850
what you have to multiply.

810
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,623
And then if you do it one by one, it starts to get easy,

811
00:28:09,663 --> 00:28:11,705
but then the real problem is when you have something

812
00:28:12,365 --> 00:28:15,388
that is like 367.58 divided by eight.

813
00:28:15,989 --> 00:28:17,710
And it's like, okay, then I just want a system

814
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:20,253
that deals with that and I don't wanna worry about that.

815
00:28:20,593 --> 00:28:21,714
So if you have something that's five,

816
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:23,356
you divide five by two and you kind of figure out

817
00:28:23,396 --> 00:28:23,756
how to do it.

818
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,360
And then the other problem they have to do

819
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,240
is the number of segments.

820
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,041
So how many of these,

821
00:28:27,061 --> 00:28:28,981
because I don't want to just get one really long segment,

822
00:28:29,321 --> 00:28:31,402
I want to figure out how many of these segments

823
00:28:31,442 --> 00:28:32,923
can I fit in this wall size.

824
00:28:33,263 --> 00:28:34,543
And then I want to kind of subdivide it.

825
00:28:34,883 --> 00:28:36,644
So you just divide it by two and you kind of round it

826
00:28:36,664 --> 00:28:37,464
so you get an integer.

827
00:28:38,144 --> 00:28:40,245
And then you figure out the individual size of those.

828
00:28:40,265 --> 00:28:42,786
So you kind of have the individual piece.

829
00:28:43,006 --> 00:28:45,807
It's going to be a scale of like a small scale

830
00:28:45,827 --> 00:28:46,967
of what the original one was.

831
00:28:47,387 --> 00:28:48,508
So you kind of get the full,

832
00:28:50,088 --> 00:28:51,388
whatchamacallit, like how do you call it?

833
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:52,789
Just the whole math.

834
00:28:52,949 --> 00:28:53,129
And it.

835
00:28:53,795 --> 00:28:56,016
I know you guys will look over it and kind of look it over,

836
00:28:56,216 --> 00:28:58,457
but it's really simple math.

837
00:28:58,838 --> 00:29:01,619
You have the wall piece, you figure out how many widgets

838
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:03,660
you want to put in it, and then you figure out

839
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,421
what is the delta of the full size

840
00:29:06,821 --> 00:29:08,682
versus the widget size that I got divided,

841
00:29:08,782 --> 00:29:10,803
and then that's just how much you need to scale things by.

842
00:29:11,763 --> 00:29:13,764
But once you have that, now you have a system

843
00:29:13,784 --> 00:29:14,465
that you can do this.

844
00:29:15,345 --> 00:29:17,366
And then it's just like, oh crap, that's magic.

845
00:29:17,426 --> 00:29:19,147
But it's like three little equations.

846
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,362
It's really like now you have a tool

847
00:29:22,402 --> 00:29:24,843
that just places things along a wall panel

848
00:29:25,144 --> 00:29:26,224
and you don't have to deal with it

849
00:29:26,344 --> 00:29:28,645
and then things will stretch up to a threshold

850
00:29:28,765 --> 00:29:31,446
and then they'll kind of move to the next stretch

851
00:29:31,506 --> 00:29:33,247
but on the opposite way and then they'll kind of start growing

852
00:29:34,128 --> 00:29:35,728
and then if you put that with a real asset,

853
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:37,489
you get something that looks like that

854
00:29:38,089 --> 00:29:39,250
and as you can see, it's like,

855
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,590
yeah, you get a little bit of a stretching

856
00:29:40,771 --> 00:29:42,871
and you can see it really bad when it's moving

857
00:29:43,432 --> 00:29:45,813
but when you kind of freeze it, it's kind of imperceptible.

858
00:29:46,753 --> 00:29:48,514
So now you have this thing that you can squish.

859
00:29:49,058 --> 00:29:51,539
But I also have a way to kind of miter things, right?

860
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:54,380
So then I have ways to kind of make things squish this way,

861
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,881
but then I can also figure out how to put corner pieces.

862
00:29:57,321 --> 00:29:59,402
So what this means is that I can have a room generator.

863
00:29:59,863 --> 00:30:02,904
So I can just make a thing that just takes a box as an input,

864
00:30:03,064 --> 00:30:05,645
and then I can make rooms with it with really basic math,

865
00:30:07,146 --> 00:30:07,886
and it just works.

866
00:30:08,026 --> 00:30:09,987
And you can see how this starts to extrapolate.

867
00:30:10,007 --> 00:30:11,708
So we started with the baseboard that everybody was like,

868
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:12,728
what the hell is this baseboard for?

869
00:30:13,408 --> 00:30:14,829
But now we get to the point that you could see

870
00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:16,090
how it extrapolated this to a building.

871
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,731
to where now this is the first floor,

872
00:30:17,751 --> 00:30:19,412
instead of kind of having things facing inside,

873
00:30:19,452 --> 00:30:21,432
I'll face them outside, same kind of technique,

874
00:30:21,813 --> 00:30:23,113
and then you just build things up,

875
00:30:23,673 --> 00:30:24,774
and then you do the same thing

876
00:30:24,794 --> 00:30:25,614
when you're building things up,

877
00:30:25,634 --> 00:30:27,215
to where it's like you divide things equally,

878
00:30:27,235 --> 00:30:28,716
and you kind of put the first floor and the last floor,

879
00:30:28,736 --> 00:30:29,676
and kind of squish the middle parts.

880
00:30:31,477 --> 00:30:33,238
But getting to this stage to where it's like,

881
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:34,798
now you have tools, and that's how people work,

882
00:30:35,179 --> 00:30:37,019
that's a hard kind of mind thing.

883
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,880
People need to drink the Kool-Aid,

884
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,541
and they have to be like, yeah, I'm in, I get it,

885
00:30:40,621 --> 00:30:41,421
that's how I want to work,

886
00:30:41,481 --> 00:30:43,522
I don't want to place things by hand ever again.

887
00:30:44,354 --> 00:30:46,494
So there's the cost involved in kind of getting to that.

888
00:30:46,794 --> 00:30:48,955
There's a lot of ego of people being like,

889
00:30:49,415 --> 00:30:50,616
I'm really fast and unreal,

890
00:30:50,656 --> 00:30:51,576
and then there's a bunch of tools

891
00:30:51,636 --> 00:30:52,596
and I can just blue, blue, blue.

892
00:30:52,757 --> 00:30:53,977
And it's like, yeah, I'm sure you could,

893
00:30:54,017 --> 00:30:57,318
but getting to that stage is really important.

894
00:30:57,658 --> 00:30:58,539
You're gonna get pushback,

895
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,279
and the best way is kind of like,

896
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,700
use these talks, use other talks

897
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,220
that people are doing with proceduralism,

898
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,741
and kind of help drive that home,

899
00:31:04,801 --> 00:31:08,822
and kind of show the light a little bit, as it were.

900
00:31:09,202 --> 00:31:10,303
So the other thing too is that.

901
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:16,232
I like to think about it as a vertical monopoly to where if you have one driverless car in

902
00:31:16,273 --> 00:31:19,233
the road, that's great because you have something that's automated and it's driving by yourself.

903
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:23,535
But the moment that you have a person driving the car, now the automated system needs to

904
00:31:23,555 --> 00:31:27,476
figure out how to drive around the bad driver and there's all these other kind of problems

905
00:31:27,516 --> 00:31:28,236
associated with it.

906
00:31:28,556 --> 00:31:32,178
So the real system is like when all of the driverless, when the whole pipeline is automated,

907
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:33,198
what does that open up?

908
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,299
So it's like when you have the whole thing that you can make a room, you can make a building,

909
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:36,979
you can make a city.

910
00:31:37,412 --> 00:31:39,314
you can place anything, what does that open up?

911
00:31:39,354 --> 00:31:40,655
Like now you can have massive worlds,

912
00:31:40,735 --> 00:31:42,316
or you can have small worlds and lots of them.

913
00:31:43,016 --> 00:31:45,258
So getting to that stage that like the whole pipeline

914
00:31:45,318 --> 00:31:47,400
is automated is kind of like the golden grail.

915
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,361
A few studios are getting really close to it,

916
00:31:50,102 --> 00:31:52,043
but you're gonna start to see that kind of paradigm shift

917
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:53,825
of just like, now games are massive,

918
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:54,865
and there's just a lot of content,

919
00:31:54,885 --> 00:31:55,626
and they're all AAA.

920
00:31:56,006 --> 00:31:57,147
And then a lot of people won't know

921
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:58,388
that they're being used procedurally,

922
00:31:58,808 --> 00:31:59,529
which is the nice part.

923
00:32:00,269 --> 00:32:01,751
So it doesn't have that kind of stank on it

924
00:32:01,771 --> 00:32:03,772
that is like, oh, it was just fractals and random seeds.

925
00:32:06,054 --> 00:32:07,135
So that's, that's, there's.

926
00:32:07,657 --> 00:32:08,117
A little bit of that.

927
00:32:09,078 --> 00:32:13,600
So just overall, the pros and cons of going procedural.

928
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,981
So it's non-destructive, so you can change your mind,

929
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:17,322
because that never happens in production.

930
00:32:18,222 --> 00:32:20,243
You have a whole pipeline that is as much automated as

931
00:32:20,283 --> 00:32:20,603
possible.

932
00:32:20,863 --> 00:32:22,664
And the really nice thing is that you can have a process

933
00:32:22,704 --> 00:32:23,364
that is parallel.

934
00:32:23,724 --> 00:32:25,865
So now you don't have this waterfall pipeline anymore.

935
00:32:26,186 --> 00:32:28,226
You can have the character starting, and you can already

936
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:30,507
start rigging and animating, and know that once the

937
00:32:30,527 --> 00:32:31,148
character's done.

938
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:33,551
the system will just pick it up and transfer weights

939
00:32:33,591 --> 00:32:34,472
and everything is done.

940
00:32:34,532 --> 00:32:37,053
So now you don't have this like, oh, lighting gets screwed

941
00:32:37,133 --> 00:32:40,154
always because they're just at the end of the pipeline

942
00:32:40,194 --> 00:32:42,195
and then they're just going to eat the little crunch

943
00:32:42,215 --> 00:32:42,696
at the end of it.

944
00:32:42,716 --> 00:32:44,757
It's like, no, they can start lighting in the beginning

945
00:32:45,137 --> 00:32:46,718
because everything is already in place.

946
00:32:47,138 --> 00:32:49,699
And we're just kind of building the shelf for it.

947
00:32:49,999 --> 00:32:51,720
But as things kind of res in, everything

948
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,480
kind of comes together.

949
00:32:53,181 --> 00:32:54,901
The cons for it is that there is a long arrangement.

950
00:32:54,981 --> 00:32:56,902
There is an investment up front that you

951
00:32:56,922 --> 00:32:57,803
kind of have to go through it.

952
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,842
there's this perceived loss of control,

953
00:32:59,882 --> 00:33:01,423
which is perceived in the beginning.

954
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:02,904
And there's a lot of people that are like,

955
00:33:03,585 --> 00:33:04,606
yeah, I don't have the control,

956
00:33:04,666 --> 00:33:05,887
but then really it's like, well,

957
00:33:06,147 --> 00:33:07,549
did I really need the control of like

958
00:33:07,589 --> 00:33:09,170
manually placing the screws on the wall?

959
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:10,852
No, like if I just draw a spline on it,

960
00:33:10,892 --> 00:33:11,812
that's enough control for me.

961
00:33:12,373 --> 00:33:13,254
And then it's new and different,

962
00:33:13,514 --> 00:33:14,415
and that means it's scary.

963
00:33:14,875 --> 00:33:16,396
And that's something that you kind of have to be

964
00:33:16,517 --> 00:33:18,578
cognizant of as you're kind of pitching things through

965
00:33:18,618 --> 00:33:20,280
that just on that emotional level,

966
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,422
people are like, I've been doing games for 20 years.

967
00:33:23,252 --> 00:33:24,173
And that's how I've done it.

968
00:33:24,373 --> 00:33:25,613
And we've always done it this way.

969
00:33:25,693 --> 00:33:26,734
You're coming in and you're telling me

970
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:28,255
that there's a completely different way of working.

971
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:29,195
I don't like that.

972
00:33:29,575 --> 00:33:31,596
I wanna, like, there's job security

973
00:33:31,636 --> 00:33:33,877
in me knowing the pipeline and me knowing how it's done.

974
00:33:34,177 --> 00:33:35,898
If you come in and displace that, that's scary.

975
00:33:36,518 --> 00:33:38,319
So it's something that you kinda have to be aware of

976
00:33:38,379 --> 00:33:39,440
and just work with them.

977
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,161
And it's as much of an emotional coaching

978
00:33:41,581 --> 00:33:43,522
as it is just like a production building.

979
00:33:44,802 --> 00:33:47,323
So then, as you kinda like, if you hitch that level of,

980
00:33:47,744 --> 00:33:49,104
okay, now we have a procedural system

981
00:33:49,144 --> 00:33:51,465
and we can build anything that we want, it's just iterating.

982
00:33:51,845 --> 00:33:54,026
And basically, each of those modules can be better.

983
00:33:54,126 --> 00:33:55,548
You can build a better poly reducer.

984
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:57,409
You can build a better quad remesher.

985
00:33:57,489 --> 00:33:58,950
You can build a better transfer of weights.

986
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,291
You can build a better UV.

987
00:34:00,631 --> 00:34:02,233
So you can kind of start driving that.

988
00:34:02,593 --> 00:34:05,415
And then you can also start tying AI-driven systems to it,

989
00:34:05,575 --> 00:34:07,356
which I have a talk in 10 minutes over there,

990
00:34:07,997 --> 00:34:11,019
which is basically, now you have this black box

991
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:13,201
that takes input, but now we have this other thing

992
00:34:13,441 --> 00:34:15,843
that can make inputs to drive this black box.

993
00:34:16,203 --> 00:34:18,125
And then now you start to get a really cool,

994
00:34:18,165 --> 00:34:19,806
interesting approach that you have.

995
00:34:20,466 --> 00:34:22,227
The artists are kind of curating the content

996
00:34:22,607 --> 00:34:24,128
more than manually generating them,

997
00:34:24,769 --> 00:34:25,950
which is a little bit different,

998
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:28,552
but it's kind of democratizes it a little bit.

999
00:34:29,032 --> 00:34:31,694
So it's a little bit of, if I can just draw a paper map

1000
00:34:31,894 --> 00:34:34,136
and make a level out of it, now QA can build maps.

1001
00:34:34,376 --> 00:34:37,999
Like you don't need to be a master world builder

1002
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:40,180
and Unreal wizard to be able to make a map.

1003
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,202
Anyone can make a map, even if it's just a white box.

1004
00:34:42,582 --> 00:34:45,744
And that gets us really closer to where we need to be,

1005
00:34:45,804 --> 00:34:46,145
which is.

1006
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:48,296
3D is too expensive to make right now.

1007
00:34:48,616 --> 00:34:50,997
There's all sorts of fields that are trying to get into 3D

1008
00:34:51,417 --> 00:34:55,440
with photogrammetry and historical preservation

1009
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,020
and archeology and all these other things

1010
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,821
that are trying to get it,

1011
00:34:57,861 --> 00:34:59,022
but it's just too damn expensive

1012
00:34:59,062 --> 00:35:00,222
because it just takes too long.

1013
00:35:00,903 --> 00:35:03,924
So getting it to where building content is cheaper,

1014
00:35:04,505 --> 00:35:06,005
you're not gonna be running out of jobs.

1015
00:35:06,025 --> 00:35:07,786
There's plenty of 3D work to go around.

1016
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:09,647
It's just a matter of distributing it

1017
00:35:09,667 --> 00:35:12,729
from being in the games industry to going out wide,

1018
00:35:13,049 --> 00:35:15,151
which I think is the next evolution for our crew.

1019
00:35:16,994 --> 00:35:18,114
So that's the rest of it.

1020
00:35:18,874 --> 00:35:20,955
Come say hi tomorrow, we have a Houdini training day.

1021
00:35:21,795 --> 00:35:24,576
So I'm gonna be talking from noon to one,

1022
00:35:25,076 --> 00:35:26,477
and it's gonna be over at the Marriott,

1023
00:35:26,857 --> 00:35:28,098
and then we're gonna have booth talks.

1024
00:35:28,138 --> 00:35:30,679
I have two talks every day, and then you can just come by.

1025
00:35:30,699 --> 00:35:32,499
I have another talk right after this,

1026
00:35:32,819 --> 00:35:34,760
so I don't think I can hang around too much for questions,

1027
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,160
but I will.

1028
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,781
But then if you can't grab me, grab me over there.

1029
00:35:38,661 --> 00:35:40,282
And that's all I got.

1030
00:35:40,482 --> 00:35:42,803
And how long do I have, 10 minutes?

1031
00:35:42,823 --> 00:35:42,903
Oh, 20. 20?

1032
00:35:43,503 --> 00:35:44,384
Okay, so we have...

1033
00:35:44,404 --> 00:35:45,824
Okay.

1034
00:35:47,257 --> 00:35:48,078
Thanks.

1035
00:35:51,179 --> 00:35:52,000
So we have two options.

1036
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,481
Choose your own adventure.

1037
00:35:55,562 --> 00:35:57,243
We can do QA and we can just chat

1038
00:35:57,423 --> 00:35:59,544
and kind of talk over whatever questions you guys have,

1039
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:01,345
or I have more content that I can just ramble

1040
00:36:01,365 --> 00:36:02,185
for another 20 minutes.

1041
00:36:03,206 --> 00:36:04,406
Show of hands, who wants questions?

1042
00:36:04,426 --> 00:36:05,027
Who has questions?

1043
00:36:07,768 --> 00:36:08,028
Okay.

1044
00:36:08,949 --> 00:36:10,530
Then I will go on to Bono's round.

1045
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,351
And then just lightning round more shit.

1046
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:15,372
Okay, Bono's round.

1047
00:36:16,456 --> 00:36:18,537
So these are the things that didn't make it to the talk.

1048
00:36:20,797 --> 00:36:22,538
And then now I just get to talk because the talk is over.

1049
00:36:23,178 --> 00:36:24,739
So another example that I wanted to talk about

1050
00:36:24,779 --> 00:36:25,359
was Dirt Skirts.

1051
00:36:25,979 --> 00:36:28,800
This didn't really fit my perfect paradigm of you

1052
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,061
have a perfect little thing, and then you move on,

1053
00:36:31,141 --> 00:36:33,541
and it's a sequence of examples.

1054
00:36:33,582 --> 00:36:35,422
But it's just another thing that people do.

1055
00:36:35,842 --> 00:36:39,483
We lost months of work doing this in a previous title.

1056
00:36:39,937 --> 00:36:42,518
And then the idea here is you have a piece of geometry

1057
00:36:42,538 --> 00:36:43,939
that's colliding with another piece of geometry

1058
00:36:43,959 --> 00:36:44,919
and you want to make a little trim

1059
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,640
because that line is really ugly.

1060
00:36:47,941 --> 00:36:49,822
So the two inputs to the system are gonna be,

1061
00:36:50,563 --> 00:36:52,244
have a piece of terrain or a piece of flat geometry

1062
00:36:52,264 --> 00:36:53,805
and then you're gonna have a rock that is a piece of,

1063
00:36:55,626 --> 00:36:56,626
just another piece of geometry.

1064
00:36:57,647 --> 00:36:59,508
So the way we do it is we Boolean them together.

1065
00:36:59,828 --> 00:37:02,089
And then that basically, with the new system,

1066
00:37:02,229 --> 00:37:04,250
you get a curve that is the Boolean,

1067
00:37:05,151 --> 00:37:07,372
that is basically where the two things meet.

1068
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:08,953
So now you have a piece of geometry

1069
00:37:08,973 --> 00:37:09,533
that is kind of like.

1070
00:37:10,115 --> 00:37:11,877
unified the rock with the terrain,

1071
00:37:13,178 --> 00:37:14,219
and then you can have a curve

1072
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:16,160
that is where the two of them meet.

1073
00:37:17,361 --> 00:37:19,103
Then you just sweep some geometry along that seam.

1074
00:37:20,144 --> 00:37:21,225
We convert that to a volume,

1075
00:37:21,585 --> 00:37:23,146
so now we kind of have like a little donut

1076
00:37:23,286 --> 00:37:24,827
that is like the kind of skirt for it.

1077
00:37:25,328 --> 00:37:26,349
And then we do an intersect

1078
00:37:26,649 --> 00:37:28,190
with that union that we had originally.

1079
00:37:28,611 --> 00:37:31,773
So now we kind of have just the skirt part

1080
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,234
of the kind of two parts of it.

1081
00:37:35,256 --> 00:37:36,677
Then we offset that by the normal,

1082
00:37:37,218 --> 00:37:38,479
and that just kind of makes it

1083
00:37:38,499 --> 00:37:39,640
so Z-fighting doesn't hate us.

1084
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:43,110
and then we add some vert alpha at the edges of it

1085
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,271
to kind of fade it a little bit.

1086
00:37:45,292 --> 00:37:46,894
And then we add UVs procedurally

1087
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:48,236
by just doing some like planar mapping

1088
00:37:48,256 --> 00:37:49,297
because it doesn't really matter

1089
00:37:49,317 --> 00:37:51,018
because you're gonna put some noisy texture here anyways.

1090
00:37:51,699 --> 00:37:52,620
And then you apply the material.

1091
00:37:53,301 --> 00:37:56,124
So that's kind of the secret of building dirt skirts.

1092
00:37:56,164 --> 00:37:57,545
And now you just have a system that it's like,

1093
00:37:57,625 --> 00:38:00,909
oh now you just have geometry and then things

1094
00:38:00,989 --> 00:38:02,771
and then just make dirt skirts for the whole map.

1095
00:38:03,536 --> 00:38:05,217
So we started to do that previously.

1096
00:38:05,237 --> 00:38:06,358
We didn't have this Boolean tool,

1097
00:38:06,378 --> 00:38:07,819
so it kind of didn't work as well,

1098
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:11,501
but now with 16 we have a lot of new stuff

1099
00:38:11,541 --> 00:38:13,322
that makes this super easy.

1100
00:38:14,143 --> 00:38:16,825
And then the other thing, which is my main talks

1101
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:19,306
in a lot of things, is basically this crazy stuff

1102
00:38:19,326 --> 00:38:21,007
that I'm doing called vertex animation textures.

1103
00:38:22,048 --> 00:38:23,629
Who has seen any of this stuff online?

1104
00:38:23,649 --> 00:38:25,170
All right, sweet.

1105
00:38:25,811 --> 00:38:26,631
So this is in 16.

1106
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:31,340
Houdini 16, and it's basically a way of getting

1107
00:38:31,921 --> 00:38:33,821
geometry caching, and Ben is gonna talk a little bit

1108
00:38:33,861 --> 00:38:36,262
about that too, in his talk, so I'm really happy to,

1109
00:38:36,302 --> 00:38:37,842
kind of like, as talks are happening at GDC,

1110
00:38:37,862 --> 00:38:39,623
you already have a DCC app that can do this stuff.

1111
00:38:40,363 --> 00:38:42,924
So it's a way of getting geometry caches

1112
00:38:43,204 --> 00:38:44,884
into a game engine using textures.

1113
00:38:45,744 --> 00:38:48,385
So the way that works is, and we had another skip button

1114
00:38:48,405 --> 00:38:50,946
in case we ran out of time, but there's four different ways

1115
00:38:50,986 --> 00:38:53,626
of doing this caching, so there's the, we call soft,

1116
00:38:53,987 --> 00:38:56,407
which is the same topology all the way through the pipeline.

1117
00:38:57,053 --> 00:38:59,455
So it's like cloth and soft body dynamics

1118
00:38:59,495 --> 00:39:00,075
and that kind of stuff.

1119
00:39:00,475 --> 00:39:01,636
Rigid, which is moving chunks.

1120
00:39:01,836 --> 00:39:03,918
So basically you have rigid body destruction.

1121
00:39:04,498 --> 00:39:06,359
Fluids, which is like a changing topology

1122
00:39:06,399 --> 00:39:07,800
and then sprite for camera facing cards.

1123
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,881
So I'm gonna go a little bit into those.

1124
00:39:10,442 --> 00:39:12,583
So the soft, basically you can get this stuff.

1125
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:15,245
So you can get cloth simulations, you can get oceans,

1126
00:39:15,345 --> 00:39:16,245
you can get soft bodies,

1127
00:39:16,266 --> 00:39:19,027
and you can actually get skin meshes, which is really cool.

1128
00:39:19,067 --> 00:39:21,909
So the Uncharted guys gave a little peek on this

1129
00:39:21,929 --> 00:39:23,390
and they're probably gonna have another talk this week

1130
00:39:24,031 --> 00:39:25,972
on how they did the chickens in Uncharted 4

1131
00:39:26,032 --> 00:39:26,472
by basically.

1132
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,711
using this kind of technique

1133
00:39:29,351 --> 00:39:31,592
and tying it with their particle system

1134
00:39:31,632 --> 00:39:32,753
because in the particle system,

1135
00:39:32,773 --> 00:39:34,554
you can just spit out static meshes,

1136
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:37,195
but then if you can have a shader that has animation on it,

1137
00:39:37,556 --> 00:39:39,196
now you have static meshes with animation

1138
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:40,677
just running around the world

1139
00:39:41,037 --> 00:39:42,899
and you can just spit out hundreds of these

1140
00:39:43,139 --> 00:39:44,099
and they're fairly fast.

1141
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,681
So what the hell is happening underneath the hood?

1142
00:39:47,221 --> 00:39:50,743
So the way we stored the data is we have these,

1143
00:39:50,943 --> 00:39:53,324
the textures, which is actually a really good format

1144
00:39:53,384 --> 00:39:53,965
because you have.

1145
00:39:54,732 --> 00:39:57,253
every pixel has a red, green, and blue component,

1146
00:39:57,614 --> 00:39:59,995
which means we can put a X, Y, and Z position in it.

1147
00:40:00,515 --> 00:40:01,976
And then we just basically store that,

1148
00:40:02,096 --> 00:40:02,877
and it's uncompressed.

1149
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:06,599
And then we make the UVs basically be lined up

1150
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:08,040
horizontally on the mesh.

1151
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,161
So you have a second UV set that just kind of like

1152
00:40:10,181 --> 00:40:11,322
gets stripped out horizontally,

1153
00:40:11,702 --> 00:40:12,923
and then on the texture side,

1154
00:40:13,183 --> 00:40:16,385
you basically just put every pixel is a point.

1155
00:40:17,017 --> 00:40:18,737
and then every frame is a row.

1156
00:40:19,157 --> 00:40:21,398
So then the shader actually needs to be super simple,

1157
00:40:21,738 --> 00:40:23,218
which is just you take that second UV set

1158
00:40:23,478 --> 00:40:24,398
and then you just scroll down.

1159
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,679
And then it kind of does a piano roll thing

1160
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:28,839
where it just kind of keeps setting the world positions

1161
00:40:28,879 --> 00:40:31,300
and the normals every frame, which works really well.

1162
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,140
So this is the Unreal shader,

1163
00:40:33,721 --> 00:40:35,081
which is not super complicated.

1164
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:37,442
So the kind of interesting part is in the bottom

1165
00:40:37,582 --> 00:40:40,222
to where, and this is online, I have it on my Twitter.

1166
00:40:40,902 --> 00:40:43,264
But basically, the hard part is just calculating the UVs

1167
00:40:43,304 --> 00:40:44,985
and kind of scrolling it down, but that's really it.

1168
00:40:45,005 --> 00:40:46,447
And then you just sample the two textures

1169
00:40:46,507 --> 00:40:48,708
on the vertex shader, and then you just set the position

1170
00:40:48,749 --> 00:40:51,030
and the world position offset, and then you set the normals.

1171
00:40:51,291 --> 00:40:53,412
And you have to do some shenanigans in Unreal in specific,

1172
00:40:53,793 --> 00:40:56,075
because you have to pass it through the custom UV channel

1173
00:40:56,295 --> 00:40:58,277
so it gets calculated in the vertex shader,

1174
00:40:58,337 --> 00:40:59,918
and then you pick it up from the vertex shader

1175
00:40:59,978 --> 00:41:00,959
and pass it to the pixel shader.

1176
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,261
So what else can we do with this?

1177
00:41:04,222 --> 00:41:05,483
So we can do destruction.

1178
00:41:06,203 --> 00:41:08,565
And instead of storing positions and normals,

1179
00:41:08,605 --> 00:41:10,006
we can store positions and rotation.

1180
00:41:10,477 --> 00:41:11,237
in your two textures.

1181
00:41:11,597 --> 00:41:13,538
So now you have this kind of same,

1182
00:41:13,558 --> 00:41:16,599
they have two exactly the same simulations,

1183
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:17,579
just exported different ways.

1184
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:19,560
So one way is using the texture animation,

1185
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,900
the other way is using joints.

1186
00:41:21,781 --> 00:41:23,241
So the same kind of system,

1187
00:41:23,281 --> 00:41:25,322
the way the artists work is the same,

1188
00:41:25,722 --> 00:41:26,943
and then they just output the data

1189
00:41:27,063 --> 00:41:27,963
the way they need to output it.

1190
00:41:28,603 --> 00:41:29,864
But the cool thing is if you were gonna try

1191
00:41:29,884 --> 00:41:31,584
to do something with like 3,000 joints,

1192
00:41:32,185 --> 00:41:34,205
that would cripple most of your consoles.

1193
00:41:34,876 --> 00:41:36,497
But with this thing, we can kind of get it,

1194
00:41:36,557 --> 00:41:38,578
and it's super fast, and it just works.

1195
00:41:38,618 --> 00:41:39,779
And the texture's not that huge,

1196
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:43,281
because you just have 3,000 by 100 texture.

1197
00:41:43,321 --> 00:41:44,942
And then you can kind of fudge it a little bit,

1198
00:41:44,962 --> 00:41:47,064
so you can basically get like a 1K by 1K texture.

1199
00:41:48,204 --> 00:41:51,026
So for this, we basically store the position

1200
00:41:51,046 --> 00:41:53,628
in the quaternion on the texture,

1201
00:41:53,688 --> 00:41:55,449
and then we store the pivot of each chunk

1202
00:41:56,009 --> 00:41:56,810
in the vertex color.

1203
00:41:58,623 --> 00:42:00,764
all of the chunks, verts, have the same UV.

1204
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:02,726
So basically, because they have the same UVs,

1205
00:42:02,766 --> 00:42:04,647
they sample the same position and rotation,

1206
00:42:04,687 --> 00:42:06,088
so they kind of move as a single unit.

1207
00:42:06,528 --> 00:42:10,791
And then they basically have to do just the movement

1208
00:42:10,932 --> 00:42:12,473
of the position and then the rotation.

1209
00:42:12,553 --> 00:42:13,613
But because you have the pivot,

1210
00:42:13,633 --> 00:42:14,894
you know how to rotate it from there,

1211
00:42:15,395 --> 00:42:16,676
and it just works.

1212
00:42:17,756 --> 00:42:18,657
And then, let's see.

1213
00:42:18,677 --> 00:42:20,578
So then the next one is the sexy one,

1214
00:42:20,718 --> 00:42:21,359
which I really like,

1215
00:42:21,379 --> 00:42:23,320
because there's really no way of doing this.

1216
00:42:24,234 --> 00:42:25,594
besides going into Alembic,

1217
00:42:25,634 --> 00:42:27,315
but then Alembic has its own problems

1218
00:42:27,355 --> 00:42:29,456
of basically recalculating the geometry of your frame.

1219
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:33,058
Ben is gonna talk Friday, a better way of doing this,

1220
00:42:33,098 --> 00:42:34,739
so I always like to say,

1221
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:37,060
this is the artist's solution to the problem.

1222
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,021
Ideally, you get a proper graphics engineer

1223
00:42:39,041 --> 00:42:41,342
that can hotwire the data into your graphics card,

1224
00:42:41,923 --> 00:42:44,104
but in our cases,

1225
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,845
that we're just bootstrapping things together,

1226
00:42:45,865 --> 00:42:47,105
it's like, yeah, we'll just write it to textures

1227
00:42:47,145 --> 00:42:47,986
and read it, because it works.

1228
00:42:48,006 --> 00:42:49,467
And then people end up, the graphics program's like,

1229
00:42:49,507 --> 00:42:51,588
no, textures are horrible, why are you doing that?

1230
00:42:52,377 --> 00:42:53,518
But it's like, hey man, it works.

1231
00:42:54,979 --> 00:42:55,959
And you kinda move on with it.

1232
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:00,381
So then you can get things like this kind of stuff,

1233
00:43:00,401 --> 00:43:01,042
which I really like.

1234
00:43:02,923 --> 00:43:04,623
You can change the topology and it just,

1235
00:43:05,324 --> 00:43:08,085
it opens up a lot of really cool effects.

1236
00:43:08,565 --> 00:43:10,506
And what we're doing here is the same thing

1237
00:43:10,566 --> 00:43:12,427
as we did before, it's where we're storing the position

1238
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:13,568
and the normals of every point,

1239
00:43:13,988 --> 00:43:15,829
and you have the option of an additional color texture

1240
00:43:15,869 --> 00:43:18,290
if you wanna get the color from the simulation.

1241
00:43:18,886 --> 00:43:20,647
But then you store a cloud of triangles,

1242
00:43:20,687 --> 00:43:22,789
which is basically the maximum amount of triangles

1243
00:43:22,829 --> 00:43:24,890
you could get in your whole sequence.

1244
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:28,112
And then every frame you just set the position

1245
00:43:28,152 --> 00:43:29,633
in the normals of the quads.

1246
00:43:29,753 --> 00:43:31,254
And then if there's no position in normals,

1247
00:43:31,274 --> 00:43:32,375
they'll get collapsed down to zero.

1248
00:43:32,715 --> 00:43:35,417
So every frame, the mesh gets reassembled.

1249
00:43:35,818 --> 00:43:37,179
And because it's already there

1250
00:43:37,339 --> 00:43:39,360
and you're not really creating geometry every frame,

1251
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:40,701
it's actually really fast.

1252
00:43:41,321 --> 00:43:42,082
And it's fairly cheap.

1253
00:43:42,562 --> 00:43:43,903
So like for this particle effect,

1254
00:43:44,604 --> 00:43:46,185
I have something that is 5,000 tries and 99 frames.

1255
00:43:47,974 --> 00:43:50,375
So you can see, I need to have uncompressed textures

1256
00:43:50,395 --> 00:43:52,035
because if I try to do block compression on this,

1257
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:53,376
just the whole data will get munched.

1258
00:43:54,476 --> 00:43:55,756
But we can kind of keep it uncompressed

1259
00:43:55,816 --> 00:43:58,197
and it's still like six megs for the whole particle.

1260
00:43:58,877 --> 00:44:01,898
I have some stuff to basically collapse the normal

1261
00:44:02,038 --> 00:44:05,399
into the alpha of the diffuse, or the position,

1262
00:44:05,459 --> 00:44:07,460
so then you only need one texture at six megs

1263
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,860
and then the mesh is tiny, it's like 600K.

1264
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,621
So compared to, if you're trying to try to do this

1265
00:44:12,681 --> 00:44:14,642
in Alembic and have like a 50 meg cache

1266
00:44:14,682 --> 00:44:15,822
or something more massive.

1267
00:44:17,088 --> 00:44:19,328
Yeah, this is fairly efficient.

1268
00:44:19,709 --> 00:44:20,929
I haven't run numbers on it yet

1269
00:44:21,009 --> 00:44:23,390
because it's too kind of bleeding, too new.

1270
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:25,790
I just finished getting the bugs worked out Saturday.

1271
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:26,850
That's why it's not on the main talk.

1272
00:44:28,671 --> 00:44:30,431
And then the last one is basically sprites.

1273
00:44:31,452 --> 00:44:34,032
And then this is if you want to kind of get GPU particles,

1274
00:44:34,092 --> 00:44:37,013
but you can actually sim it and get it art directed

1275
00:44:37,073 --> 00:44:39,054
and kind of get it doing exactly what I want it to do.

1276
00:44:39,554 --> 00:44:40,974
And then you kind of bring it into the game

1277
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:42,175
and kind of have the same look.

1278
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:45,035
So what we do here is similar to the other one.

1279
00:44:45,525 --> 00:44:48,026
to where instead of storing this triangle cloud,

1280
00:44:48,066 --> 00:44:49,286
we just store a quad cloud,

1281
00:44:49,746 --> 00:44:52,107
and then we basically move the positions of each of those

1282
00:44:52,187 --> 00:44:53,067
to where they need to be,

1283
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,848
and then we just make the shader be camera-facing.

1284
00:44:55,748 --> 00:44:57,888
So it's very, all the techniques

1285
00:44:57,908 --> 00:44:59,129
kind of build on top of each other.

1286
00:45:00,469 --> 00:45:03,329
And then, yeah, so this is the kind of whole shebang

1287
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:06,130
of the things, like the sprite is not on this one,

1288
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:09,371
but you can see how, and this is me making bad art,

1289
00:45:09,491 --> 00:45:10,851
because I'm like a lazy artist.

1290
00:45:10,871 --> 00:45:12,512
I went to art school, but I became a tech artist

1291
00:45:12,532 --> 00:45:14,392
because I'm lazy, and I don't like spending time

1292
00:45:14,432 --> 00:45:14,792
making art.

1293
00:45:15,978 --> 00:45:17,759
But if you get a real proper,

1294
00:45:17,779 --> 00:45:19,740
and you can swing by the booth,

1295
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,821
and we have better examples of Magnus doing

1296
00:45:21,861 --> 00:45:24,102
some amazing lava, you guys might have seen online.

1297
00:45:25,103 --> 00:45:26,824
If you give this to a proper artist

1298
00:45:26,844 --> 00:45:27,745
that knows what they're doing with,

1299
00:45:28,285 --> 00:45:29,406
you're gonna get some amazing stuff.

1300
00:45:30,206 --> 00:45:31,287
And that's really the end of it.

1301
00:45:31,987 --> 00:45:33,188
All right, so now I'll take questions,

1302
00:45:33,228 --> 00:45:34,909
and then we can go over the next thing.

1303
00:45:35,669 --> 00:45:36,270
Thank you again.

1304
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:36,910
Second.

1305
00:45:46,062 --> 00:45:46,463
Questions?

1306
00:45:49,626 --> 00:45:49,786
Hey.

1307
00:45:51,107 --> 00:45:52,668
So great talk.

1308
00:45:53,189 --> 00:45:55,791
Just I feel much less alone right now.

1309
00:45:56,432 --> 00:45:58,234
OK.

1310
00:45:58,254 --> 00:46:01,477
This is absolutely everything, I think, since many years.

1311
00:46:01,517 --> 00:46:05,100
So it's really cool to see all these people listening to this.

1312
00:46:06,339 --> 00:46:12,404
the sometimes when you take artists in a company you feel a bit alone with all the things that

1313
00:46:12,464 --> 00:46:20,610
nobody believes it's magic and okay it's not possible so it's very interesting and I feel

1314
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:27,356
something is missing a bit to this talk maybe many things because it's short but it's

1315
00:46:28,756 --> 00:46:34,399
Most of the time we try to solve problems, we try to automate things, so there is some

1316
00:46:34,499 --> 00:46:40,082
kind of defined problem and we try to find a solution, but also sometimes we find something

1317
00:46:40,142 --> 00:46:40,322
new.

1318
00:46:40,782 --> 00:46:41,443
Yeah.

1319
00:46:41,543 --> 00:46:43,864
We answer a question nobody asks.

1320
00:46:44,524 --> 00:46:51,811
And that's very interesting too because it's not always trying to fix a productivity problem.

1321
00:46:51,891 --> 00:46:53,272
Sometimes it's also art.

1322
00:46:53,833 --> 00:46:55,534
And it's another way to do art.

1323
00:46:55,714 --> 00:47:01,679
It's just using anything, code, scripts, software, anything to do art.

1324
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,082
And what do you think about this?

1325
00:47:04,462 --> 00:47:05,122
I think it's awesome.

1326
00:47:05,162 --> 00:47:07,585
I think that's where it gets into really interesting land because...

1327
00:47:08,044 --> 00:47:11,325
you move from TechCardist being this kind of firefighting unit

1328
00:47:11,765 --> 00:47:13,506
to being the people making the content

1329
00:47:13,826 --> 00:47:14,786
and being the people that,

1330
00:47:15,066 --> 00:47:16,567
they were the only people that could pull this off.

1331
00:47:16,587 --> 00:47:18,228
So when I was in production, I was that,

1332
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:19,348
like I was the river guy

1333
00:47:19,388 --> 00:47:20,668
and I was the kind of hard problem guy.

1334
00:47:21,148 --> 00:47:23,669
So, and it's still in the problem space,

1335
00:47:23,849 --> 00:47:25,570
but like if we can get to the point

1336
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:27,651
that TechCard is just driving that

1337
00:47:27,751 --> 00:47:29,411
and they'll be like, hey, there's this crazy new game

1338
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:32,132
that is possible only because of this new system

1339
00:47:32,172 --> 00:47:34,793
that I came up with, that is, that's absolutely.

1340
00:47:35,073 --> 00:47:35,753
Like I come from a,

1341
00:47:36,523 --> 00:47:38,644
a broken down production jaded environment.

1342
00:47:38,664 --> 00:47:39,985
So I'm just looking at the next problem.

1343
00:47:40,405 --> 00:47:41,886
But yeah, seeing it as a,

1344
00:47:43,147 --> 00:47:44,608
there's just a wide open field

1345
00:47:44,668 --> 00:47:46,709
and now a tech artist is kind of driving it.

1346
00:47:47,309 --> 00:47:48,610
And I went into another thing.

1347
00:47:50,151 --> 00:47:51,411
Okay, yeah, absolutely.

1348
00:47:51,471 --> 00:47:53,092
No, that's where I want to get to.

1349
00:47:53,373 --> 00:47:55,434
To where tech artists are the ones making the content

1350
00:47:55,794 --> 00:47:58,335
and then we're the ones kind of pushing it forward.

1351
00:47:58,636 --> 00:47:59,496
Very, very good point.

1352
00:48:00,056 --> 00:48:00,297
Thanks.

1353
00:48:00,737 --> 00:48:00,857
Yeah.

1354
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:03,698
All right, everybody.

1355
00:48:04,039 --> 00:48:04,599
Thank you so much.

1356
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:07,218
And then come talk to me afterwards there in the booth.

1357
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:09,442
And Bennett is up next.
