1
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:07,797
All right, good afternoon, everybody.

2
00:00:08,618 --> 00:00:11,100
Before I start, just a reminder to please

3
00:00:11,141 --> 00:00:13,643
mute your cell phones or anything else that will ring.

4
00:00:15,685 --> 00:00:17,307
So my name's Ian.

5
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:19,929
I'm the CEO and co-founder of Fox Club.

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,594
We're a distributed team, completely remote,

7
00:00:24,734 --> 00:00:25,955
and we make mobile slots games.

8
00:00:26,903 --> 00:00:29,345
So we started the team about three years ago.

9
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:32,567
And when we first started, my co-founder and I

10
00:00:32,627 --> 00:00:33,488
happened to be remote.

11
00:00:33,528 --> 00:00:35,430
He was living in Germany, and I was living here

12
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,210
in San Francisco.

13
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:39,213
And we did that because we both had lifestyle reasons

14
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:40,434
for wanting to work from home.

15
00:00:41,034 --> 00:00:43,856
And as we grew the team from there, we found out that

16
00:00:44,793 --> 00:00:47,675
there was no real reason to hire people where we were living,

17
00:00:47,695 --> 00:00:50,396
because we didn't want to be going to an office to work.

18
00:00:50,436 --> 00:00:51,316
We liked working from home.

19
00:00:51,617 --> 00:00:53,898
And so we continued building the team out completely remotely.

20
00:00:54,318 --> 00:00:56,759
So now we're about 30 people, and our team

21
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:59,280
is spread out in 12 different countries,

22
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,961
encompassing a lot of different time zones.

23
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:04,764
And along the way we've learned a lot about how to run a remote

24
00:01:04,804 --> 00:01:07,887
team, how to hire for a remote team. And there was really a

25
00:01:07,927 --> 00:01:11,390
critical point when we scaled past 8 or 10 people to kind of

26
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,033
the 20s where a lot of things changed for us. And so those are

27
00:01:15,053 --> 00:01:18,997
some of the main things I want to share. Before I start, how

28
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:23,661
many people here work remotely now? Cool. And how many don't

29
00:01:23,721 --> 00:01:27,005
but want to work remotely? All right.

30
00:01:28,132 --> 00:01:34,556
So I guess a lot of you guys already have experience with that. So we'll talk about maybe some of the things that have worked for us, maybe things that apply to you guys.

31
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:40,640
And afterwards, if anyone has ideas or suggestions, I'd love to hear them and chat some more after.

32
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:47,184
So I'm going to go through kind of three major things. One is, why is remote work attractive?

33
00:01:47,624 --> 00:01:53,228
For us as people who work, why is it fun to work remotely? I think that's going to be pretty obvious and we'll do that quickly.

34
00:01:53,928 --> 00:01:56,750
The second main one is really around hiring and team.

35
00:01:58,457 --> 00:02:01,481
as a business owner or manager,

36
00:02:01,901 --> 00:02:03,223
what does it mean to hire remotely

37
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:05,045
and why is hiring a competitive advantage

38
00:02:05,285 --> 00:02:06,287
for being a remote team?

39
00:02:07,148 --> 00:02:09,110
And third is a lot of operational things

40
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,452
that we've found to be successful.

41
00:02:10,512 --> 00:02:12,614
So how do we communicate and collaborate?

42
00:02:12,634 --> 00:02:13,435
What tools are useful?

43
00:02:13,455 --> 00:02:15,237
And so the third section is a lot more tactical.

44
00:02:16,975 --> 00:02:18,036
So just at a high level, right?

45
00:02:18,076 --> 00:02:20,218
Like there's already 10% of the workforce overall

46
00:02:20,258 --> 00:02:21,099
that's fully remote.

47
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,860
30% is partially remote.

48
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,422
This is gonna continue being a huge trend.

49
00:02:26,403 --> 00:02:28,425
We're big fans of Jacob Morgan

50
00:02:28,545 --> 00:02:30,907
and his overall thing about how work is changing.

51
00:02:30,927 --> 00:02:32,528
And the central thesis here is that

52
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:35,411
we have a generation of people who have grown up

53
00:02:35,471 --> 00:02:37,032
with technology in their lives.

54
00:02:37,873 --> 00:02:42,176
personally, and we also have this tremendous improvement in how communication

55
00:02:42,216 --> 00:02:46,599
collaborate collaboration technology has gotten better. And so when these two things come together,

56
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:52,063
there's going to be a push from the ground up of how work needs to change and how companies need to

57
00:02:52,383 --> 00:02:56,146
kind of interact with people differently, and remote is a huge component of that.

58
00:02:58,287 --> 00:03:00,749
So let's start with like why we want to work remote, right? So

59
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,532
for us, a lot of it is about family. My co-founder had a

60
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:09,629
four-month-old when we first started the company.

61
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,651
And he really wanted to spend more time with his daughter.

62
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:15,973
And he was able to actually be a pretty present parent.

63
00:03:15,993 --> 00:03:17,494
He wasn't the primary caretaker, right?

64
00:03:17,774 --> 00:03:19,135
But he was there a lot.

65
00:03:19,595 --> 00:03:21,756
And he was also a great CTO and co-founder.

66
00:03:22,556 --> 00:03:23,697
There were some sacrifices.

67
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:25,698
He couldn't play dota anymore, and he couldn't really sleep.

68
00:03:26,198 --> 00:03:28,200
But he did manage to make both those things work.

69
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,781
There's maybe a third of our team

70
00:03:30,841 --> 00:03:32,802
where family is the really big reason,

71
00:03:32,822 --> 00:03:34,943
being able to spend time and work more flexibly.

72
00:03:36,993 --> 00:03:41,355
There's another third of our team who did this because we wanted to have a particular lifestyle

73
00:03:41,535 --> 00:03:45,577
I was one of those so I wanted to travel and work and work from different places

74
00:03:46,097 --> 00:03:51,440
And I really have been able to enjoy doing that and go to different places stay there get an Airbnb for two or three weeks

75
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,461
And work from somewhere new and I really travel for food

76
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,903
So as long as I get to go out and eat and come back and do my work

77
00:03:57,323 --> 00:03:58,723
It didn't matter where I was working from

78
00:03:59,752 --> 00:04:02,294
our director of engineering really likes EDM concerts.

79
00:04:02,434 --> 00:04:04,495
So he'll go around to all these crazy locations,

80
00:04:04,935 --> 00:04:07,096
get completely ridiculous for two or three days

81
00:04:07,136 --> 00:04:09,397
on the weekend, and then somehow manage to get back

82
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,597
and focus and get the work done.

83
00:04:11,038 --> 00:04:13,159
And as a team, we rarely even notice it,

84
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:15,180
because as long as the people are being productive,

85
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:15,900
it doesn't matter.

86
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:21,563
Those two things, I think, really underscore

87
00:04:21,703 --> 00:04:22,823
one of the big things that we had to do

88
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,404
as a remote team that we had to do differently,

89
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,145
which was measure people on output and not on hours.

90
00:04:28,694 --> 00:04:31,555
when people talk to me about how do you run a remote team,

91
00:04:31,575 --> 00:04:32,415
how do you manage people,

92
00:04:32,675 --> 00:04:34,295
like you can't even see if they're working, right?

93
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,436
It's like, yeah, that's true.

94
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:36,876
You can't see what anyone is doing.

95
00:04:37,216 --> 00:04:38,877
And so the only thing you can do is look at

96
00:04:39,077 --> 00:04:39,957
what are you producing?

97
00:04:40,037 --> 00:04:41,817
Are you producing your fair share of the work?

98
00:04:41,937 --> 00:04:42,838
Is your results good?

99
00:04:42,878 --> 00:04:43,638
Is the quality good?

100
00:04:44,098 --> 00:04:46,278
And it turns out if you try to measure people based on that,

101
00:04:46,338 --> 00:04:47,339
it's actually not that hard.

102
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:49,959
We've been able to do that successfully across dev,

103
00:04:50,719 --> 00:04:54,220
art, design, UI, sound, and it works quite well.

104
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,914
And the third one is obviously if you just save on commute,

105
00:04:57,954 --> 00:05:00,938
you get an extra hour or two of your day back every day.

106
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:01,640
So it's great.

107
00:05:04,007 --> 00:05:07,608
So we've sort of stumbled upon this by accident initially,

108
00:05:07,688 --> 00:05:09,649
right, because this was a very selfish motivation for us

109
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:10,649
when we first started the company.

110
00:05:11,109 --> 00:05:13,289
But now that we've done this and actually experienced

111
00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:15,370
what the growth looks like, we think that this is

112
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,750
a huge opportunity, a huge competitive advantage.

113
00:05:18,171 --> 00:05:20,351
And the big one is actually not cost, right?

114
00:05:20,391 --> 00:05:21,771
We're gonna talk about cost in a little bit.

115
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:23,992
But I think that the biggest advantage we have

116
00:05:24,232 --> 00:05:25,412
is really around hiring.

117
00:05:25,912 --> 00:05:28,733
And it's more subtle.

118
00:05:29,453 --> 00:05:29,553
So.

119
00:05:30,534 --> 00:05:32,755
You kind of have three major ways you can hire right now, right?

120
00:05:32,855 --> 00:05:34,897
You can one, either be in a tech hub like San Francisco.

121
00:05:35,317 --> 00:05:39,081
And you can compete with like the hundreds of really, really well-funded companies.

122
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:42,263
But the advantage of being in a tech hub like this is that you get

123
00:05:42,503 --> 00:05:44,305
world-class talent in every discipline.

124
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:47,447
You have the best people at what they do in one place.

125
00:05:47,768 --> 00:05:51,351
And if you can find like the attractive mission for them,

126
00:05:51,391 --> 00:05:53,973
like the good goals for them to go after,

127
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,055
and you have the money, you can get world-class anything you want.

128
00:05:58,055 --> 00:05:58,775
That's one path.

129
00:05:59,235 --> 00:06:02,156
The other path is you find something that's not a hub city,

130
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,777
but still has a great source of talent.

131
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,617
Usually for that route, you want to find

132
00:06:05,677 --> 00:06:06,878
a really strong feeder, right?

133
00:06:06,898 --> 00:06:08,158
So there's a lot of stories of like,

134
00:06:08,658 --> 00:06:10,919
like Montreal has tremendous technical talent, right?

135
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:11,839
Like lots of great devs.

136
00:06:11,859 --> 00:06:13,640
So we see a lot of great dev shops in Montreal.

137
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,901
There are places with really great art schools

138
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:16,641
and art pipelines.

139
00:06:17,181 --> 00:06:19,962
A lot of the times in a place that's not one of the hubs,

140
00:06:20,582 --> 00:06:22,883
you can find great talent in one or two disciplines,

141
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,004
but it's hard to find a world-class talent in everything.

142
00:06:25,564 --> 00:06:27,726
So obviously, where's my story going?

143
00:06:29,327 --> 00:06:32,310
If you go globally, you can actually find and cherry pick

144
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,152
the best of the talent from everywhere.

145
00:06:34,992 --> 00:06:36,233
We believe we've been doing that,

146
00:06:36,314 --> 00:06:38,696
and we've actually been really surprised and impressed

147
00:06:38,736 --> 00:06:40,157
at the quality of the people that we've gotten

148
00:06:40,617 --> 00:06:42,299
in really random places around the world

149
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,200
that we never expected.

150
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,803
I worked at Zynga before, and so I calibrate a lot of our.

151
00:06:47,463 --> 00:06:49,325
art talent and engineering talent against that.

152
00:06:49,805 --> 00:06:53,148
And when I look at kind of the skill level comparisons,

153
00:06:53,468 --> 00:06:56,110
we have really, really world-class talented people.

154
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,151
And we've been able to find them

155
00:06:58,271 --> 00:07:00,153
for very attractive rates, right?

156
00:07:00,173 --> 00:07:02,835
Because they live in places that are often not tech hubs

157
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,556
and don't have the cost of living adjustments.

158
00:07:05,377 --> 00:07:06,178
And they're really happy

159
00:07:06,238 --> 00:07:09,020
because we have a long-term engagement with them

160
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,762
where they really like the work, the lifestyle we have

161
00:07:12,222 --> 00:07:14,464
and are like motivated to stay for longer.

162
00:07:15,815 --> 00:07:16,995
So that's kind of the hiring bit.

163
00:07:17,636 --> 00:07:21,318
We also think of hiring as like a long-term sales thing.

164
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:24,459
So the advantages that we offer in terms of lifestyle,

165
00:07:24,499 --> 00:07:26,240
work-life balance, communication,

166
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,841
being measured on impact, right?

167
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:29,442
These are all kind of the benefits that we have.

168
00:07:30,022 --> 00:07:31,964
And it's part of how like the,

169
00:07:32,304 --> 00:07:34,725
it needs to be sold throughout the entire hiring process.

170
00:07:35,345 --> 00:07:38,408
So we've adjusted how we hire in order to suit that.

171
00:07:38,448 --> 00:07:40,269
So what we do is with every discipline,

172
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,872
we give them a quick test, like a one to two day test.

173
00:07:44,292 --> 00:07:45,974
And the goal of the test is twofold.

174
00:07:46,094 --> 00:07:47,295
One is, can you do the work?

175
00:07:47,515 --> 00:07:48,235
That's the obvious part.

176
00:07:48,555 --> 00:07:51,137
The other one is, can you do the work in our environment?

177
00:07:51,218 --> 00:07:53,599
So we try to mimic our actual operating environment

178
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:55,501
as much as possible during this two day test.

179
00:07:55,941 --> 00:08:00,823
We set them up with the same tools. We communicate with them the same way that we would if they were fully with us.

180
00:08:01,543 --> 00:08:04,604
We give them feedback the same way. And then we just look at the outcomes.

181
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:10,586
And it tells us, can you work in a way that's unsupervised? Can you do it in a time frame that's reasonable?

182
00:08:10,646 --> 00:08:13,126
Are you able to communicate clearly? And it lets them know.

183
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,428
Is this kind of the flexibility I want?

184
00:08:15,548 --> 00:08:17,570
Are they actually giving me the experience that I want

185
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,653
in terms of work life, in terms of having ownership over my work?

186
00:08:21,053 --> 00:08:21,874
And is this something I can do?

187
00:08:22,234 --> 00:08:24,837
And it's definitely helped us both attract people

188
00:08:24,897 --> 00:08:26,699
who go through the test with us and say,

189
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:29,101
oh, this is actually really good, I'm really excited.

190
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:30,582
It's also helped us find people who are like,

191
00:08:30,602 --> 00:08:33,145
well, this really isn't the kind of company I want to work for

192
00:08:33,225 --> 00:08:35,267
where we're kind of completely remote all the time.

193
00:08:36,463 --> 00:08:39,345
So I'm going to run through quickly the main ways that we

194
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:41,506
hire artists and devs and run through the test real quick.

195
00:08:41,846 --> 00:08:44,788
So for us, because we develop in Unity, we found that the

196
00:08:44,868 --> 00:08:48,170
Unity forum and the Reddit, particularly subreddits for

197
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,751
Game Dev and Unity Dev, are really good.

198
00:08:50,391 --> 00:08:53,873
And then what we do is we give them a set of assets.

199
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:56,494
And so this is two examples of a successful candidate and a

200
00:08:56,554 --> 00:08:57,615
not so successful candidate.

201
00:08:58,475 --> 00:08:59,516
And we give them the same assets,

202
00:08:59,536 --> 00:09:01,257
we give them the same spec that we would on the team,

203
00:09:01,537 --> 00:09:02,377
and we just look at the results.

204
00:09:02,437 --> 00:09:04,898
So this one was basically, here are some assets

205
00:09:04,918 --> 00:09:05,699
that are really simple.

206
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:10,681
Can you make a slot machine that spins?

207
00:09:13,022 --> 00:09:14,603
Sorry, I'm trying to play this.

208
00:09:18,584 --> 00:09:23,066
So this is one where it's not super fancy,

209
00:09:23,106 --> 00:09:24,247
but spins like a slot machine.

210
00:09:25,767 --> 00:09:26,488
And then this one.

211
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:32,829
Doesn't look so much like a slot machine.

212
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:35,970
Same level of feedback, same level of instructions.

213
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,291
So that was dev.

214
00:09:38,591 --> 00:09:40,551
On R, the kind of traditional places

215
00:09:40,571 --> 00:09:43,192
that you find online contract R seem to work pretty well,

216
00:09:43,532 --> 00:09:45,712
and we basically start people on this test

217
00:09:45,912 --> 00:09:47,473
and then get them one project

218
00:09:47,573 --> 00:09:48,773
and then bring them on fully.

219
00:09:49,233 --> 00:09:51,453
And we communicate that kind of up front with people

220
00:09:51,473 --> 00:09:53,634
in terms of here's what the expectations are.

221
00:09:54,974 --> 00:09:57,816
Similarly, we tell them this is the target style that we're looking for.

222
00:09:58,396 --> 00:10:00,437
And then here are the two portfolios of two people.

223
00:10:00,477 --> 00:10:04,038
So one is, this is the portfolio beforehand, and here's another one.

224
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:07,300
And I'm not an art director, so like these two both look pretty reasonable,

225
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,281
but neither of them is the style that we're really looking for.

226
00:10:10,061 --> 00:10:13,305
But when we took both people through the process and we go black white sketches first

227
00:10:13,325 --> 00:10:15,807
Which is how we normally do it and then give them some feedback

228
00:10:16,007 --> 00:10:20,212
Sorry, the right one is a little bit hard to see but it's it's like a pretty reasonable line drawing

229
00:10:20,652 --> 00:10:24,136
And then we go through to color like by the time we get to this and there's two rounds of feedback

230
00:10:24,496 --> 00:10:26,058
Kind of the difference in style is pretty clear

231
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:31,923
This is a lot more of what we're looking for on the left and this is kind of not really a good slots part

232
00:10:33,887 --> 00:10:39,765
And again, the overall thing here is get people to see how you actually work as much as possible and get them in on your process.

233
00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:45,070
So just to summarize in terms of what we're looking for in terms of hiring,

234
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:48,271
like the advantages or the core things that we're looking for.

235
00:10:48,671 --> 00:10:50,792
One is communicating your culture upfront and how you work.

236
00:10:51,432 --> 00:10:54,713
Um, the second one is actually, this might be part of just, uh,

237
00:10:54,913 --> 00:10:56,234
because we're a small growing company.

238
00:10:56,274 --> 00:10:59,735
We've had a really hard time hiring people and then training them on it.

239
00:10:59,795 --> 00:11:03,396
We've really found more success finding people with the core skills that we want

240
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,537
and kind of treating them on the remote piece.

241
00:11:05,677 --> 00:11:07,838
So like a lot of training seems to be difficult.

242
00:11:08,818 --> 00:11:13,901
The third one is time zone. So I said up front that we have people across a lot of time zones already.

243
00:11:14,901 --> 00:11:18,603
We found that with artists, with people who are able to work relatively individually,

244
00:11:19,864 --> 00:11:22,886
being in different time zones and working in different time zones, not so much of a problem.

245
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:26,708
For everyone else, developers, designers, UI, where you need a lot of collaboration.

246
00:11:27,368 --> 00:11:32,511
Our rule is you can work from anywhere you want, but you've got to be working primarily core hours Pacific time

247
00:11:32,551 --> 00:11:34,412
So we've set Pacific time as our core hours

248
00:11:34,873 --> 00:11:38,935
And so you can travel anywhere around the world you want as long as you're working core hours there

249
00:11:39,316 --> 00:11:43,138
And if you have stuff that come up during the day, whatever you need to go take care of doctors kids

250
00:11:43,158 --> 00:11:48,662
That's fine. But we know when most of the team is going to be on and available and like ready to work together

251
00:11:52,227 --> 00:11:53,989
Cool, so that was kind of all the hiring stuff.

252
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,712
Next we have a whole bunch around operational

253
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:57,573
and tactical things.

254
00:12:05,482 --> 00:12:09,247
So, one of the things that we saw in terms of like

255
00:12:09,267 --> 00:12:10,148
when we talk to people is.

256
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:14,441
We coordinate around Slack in almost everything,

257
00:12:14,481 --> 00:12:17,123
and we're able to work pretty effectively online

258
00:12:17,163 --> 00:12:17,623
with everything.

259
00:12:18,023 --> 00:12:19,644
But there was a whole bunch of work

260
00:12:19,684 --> 00:12:20,965
that went into getting to that.

261
00:12:21,345 --> 00:12:23,367
And so when we talk to people now about,

262
00:12:23,407 --> 00:12:25,728
like, does this work, does remote work,

263
00:12:26,229 --> 00:12:27,009
we tell them it does.

264
00:12:27,169 --> 00:12:28,870
But, like, when people try to do it,

265
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,752
and they do it incrementally or they try it

266
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,293
without having all the fixes in place,

267
00:12:32,673 --> 00:12:34,294
it seems like it's just impossible.

268
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,478
So, there was a lot of work that goes into finding out

269
00:12:37,538 --> 00:12:39,981
what the differences are between co-located work,

270
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:42,003
which we're used to, and switching to remote.

271
00:12:42,984 --> 00:12:44,206
So, let's start with Slack.

272
00:12:44,787 --> 00:12:46,569
Everyone, everyone here use Slack?

273
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,152
Okay, yeah, Slack's huge, right?

274
00:12:49,172 --> 00:12:49,672
Slack's awesome.

275
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,190
When we moved everything onto Slack,

276
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,251
one of the big things that we realized was

277
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,573
we have to have a ton of channels.

278
00:12:58,133 --> 00:13:01,295
We have gotten super ridiculously aggressive

279
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:02,496
with making new channels.

280
00:13:02,936 --> 00:13:05,658
And the way we use channels is each conversation thread,

281
00:13:05,698 --> 00:13:06,998
each thing that used to be an email

282
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,179
is actually a separate channel.

283
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,741
And so we basically have hundreds of channels.

284
00:13:13,365 --> 00:13:16,267
The way we manage it is the start section in the top,

285
00:13:16,307 --> 00:13:18,689
right, your favorites, those are only channels

286
00:13:18,809 --> 00:13:20,870
that you would initiate conversations into.

287
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:24,472
So for me, I have all of our production channels start,

288
00:13:24,552 --> 00:13:26,273
all of our design channels start, sign off,

289
00:13:28,294 --> 00:13:31,677
kind of like planning, those are all my start channels,

290
00:13:31,697 --> 00:13:33,157
because those are the things I start conversations in.

291
00:13:33,818 --> 00:13:35,419
There are like hundreds of other channels.

292
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,302
Dev, R, lots of execution channels that I'm in,

293
00:13:38,762 --> 00:13:39,663
but I'm not starred.

294
00:13:39,963 --> 00:13:41,304
And so those are kind of all down here,

295
00:13:41,925 --> 00:13:42,946
and I don't look at those.

296
00:13:43,266 --> 00:13:44,947
Like if someone needs me in one of those channels,

297
00:13:45,308 --> 00:13:47,770
they know to ping me with an at ping.

298
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,092
And so I can basically go through most of my day

299
00:13:50,172 --> 00:13:51,072
and not read any of this.

300
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:53,354
And that's how you can keep a lot of channels

301
00:13:53,434 --> 00:13:56,397
and have kind of message and thought segregation

302
00:13:56,737 --> 00:13:58,318
without being completely overwhelmed

303
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,099
with the different things.

304
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:06,218
The other thing that we find really useful is muting most of the channels that you're not in,

305
00:14:06,258 --> 00:14:08,580
so that you can be in channels, you can actually respond to things,

306
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,161
but you don't get constantly pinged.

307
00:14:10,802 --> 00:14:13,984
We've worked with a lot of other partners who also use Slack

308
00:14:14,044 --> 00:14:16,366
and found a lot of different feedback that they've had, where like,

309
00:14:16,906 --> 00:14:19,408
you know, I can't get anything done because I'm on Slack.

310
00:14:19,548 --> 00:14:20,489
Everything is on Slack.

311
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:22,811
And we believe that everything needs to be on Slack,

312
00:14:22,831 --> 00:14:24,132
but you don't need to be reading everything.

313
00:14:24,212 --> 00:14:26,774
Otherwise, you're just getting the same problem as you had with email,

314
00:14:27,054 --> 00:14:28,255
with just content overwhelming.

315
00:14:31,244 --> 00:14:32,945
And then once everything is on Slack, right?

316
00:14:32,965 --> 00:14:34,926
Like, I'm not gonna go into all the details

317
00:14:34,966 --> 00:14:35,787
of all the integrations,

318
00:14:35,807 --> 00:14:37,368
but obviously you can integrate all your servers,

319
00:14:37,388 --> 00:14:38,309
all your notifications,

320
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:40,831
all your kind of like dev related things into Slack.

321
00:14:41,472 --> 00:14:42,152
Once we have that,

322
00:14:42,192 --> 00:14:43,653
then we try to bring as much of the art

323
00:14:43,693 --> 00:14:45,134
and creative side into it as possible.

324
00:14:45,215 --> 00:14:47,616
So Jing is a tool that we found really useful.

325
00:14:47,676 --> 00:14:49,918
And the main advantage here is that it paces as a link.

326
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:51,159
So you can take a screenshot,

327
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,521
you can do some like quick editing on it

328
00:14:53,641 --> 00:14:54,722
to tell people what you're looking at,

329
00:14:55,042 --> 00:14:56,103
and then you can share it as a link.

330
00:14:57,164 --> 00:15:02,030
Sharing it as a link over an embedded attachment or an uploaded file is really useful because

331
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:07,215
if you bring this from Slack into another chat with someone else or you bring it into

332
00:15:07,476 --> 00:15:11,300
Trello or Google Docs, you don't have to find the asset and paste it around.

333
00:15:14,171 --> 00:15:15,653
SoundCloud for audio stuff.

334
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:19,817
So the Slack doesn't have, like, they're constantly building out their integrations, right?

335
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:21,379
But SoundCloud is one of their better integrations,

336
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:23,401
where if you have an audio file, you upload it into SoundCloud,

337
00:15:23,802 --> 00:15:25,123
it plays in line in Slack.

338
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:28,046
So the more you can get people to sit inside of this for all of their work,

339
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,990
and the more seamless you can make it, the more, like, consistent it'll be.

340
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:34,754
So that's kind of, like, tactical Slack tools.

341
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,549
The other thing that, like, there's like three other main things that we found that are different

342
00:15:39,609 --> 00:15:44,296
between co-located teams and remote teams, and we've kind of like segregated those three

343
00:15:44,316 --> 00:15:48,441
problems into different solutions. So, when we, when we approach the problem of like,

344
00:15:48,561 --> 00:15:52,747
how do we figure out how to have communications that replace in-person communication?

345
00:15:53,448 --> 00:15:57,770
How do we have like casual conversations where two people are talking about a problem

346
00:15:58,111 --> 00:16:02,053
and because they happen to be in an office, there's a third person that sits near them, right?

347
00:16:02,553 --> 00:16:05,995
That is part of the conversation or listens in and decides they want to be part of it.

348
00:16:06,235 --> 00:16:08,837
How do we replicate that? How do we replicate casual conversations?

349
00:16:09,743 --> 00:16:12,586
So we tried a whole bunch of real time chat systems and end

350
00:16:12,646 --> 00:16:14,528
up on TeamSpeak as our solution.

351
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:18,012
And we have a pretty customized setup where every

352
00:16:18,052 --> 00:16:19,574
single person is full admin.

353
00:16:19,634 --> 00:16:22,217
And so every single person can move every other person in

354
00:16:22,257 --> 00:16:22,918
between channels.

355
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:26,462
And the reason here is that we want to have as low friction

356
00:16:26,482 --> 00:16:28,865
as possible between two people talking to each other.

357
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:33,751
And how we set it up is we have a green channel where this

358
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,072
basically means I'm working, but I'm

359
00:16:35,112 --> 00:16:36,173
available for conversations.

360
00:16:36,793 --> 00:16:39,395
We have a yellow channel, which is I'm working, but I

361
00:16:39,435 --> 00:16:41,076
don't really want to talk to you for casual things.

362
00:16:41,096 --> 00:16:43,498
And this is the equivalent of I have my headphones on, I have

363
00:16:43,518 --> 00:16:46,019
the little barrier up, and I'm over my computer.

364
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,741
And then we have red, which is just like I am not here,

365
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:49,302
don't talk to me.

366
00:16:51,163 --> 00:16:52,984
On top of those three things, we have a whole bunch of

367
00:16:53,064 --> 00:16:53,684
public channels.

368
00:16:53,844 --> 00:16:55,926
And every channel is like a conference room.

369
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,571
And so we have the main one that people hang out in,

370
00:16:58,611 --> 00:17:00,633
like a main dev channel and a main art channel.

371
00:17:00,993 --> 00:17:03,254
And people can just move themselves into the channel

372
00:17:03,335 --> 00:17:04,015
and start talking.

373
00:17:04,695 --> 00:17:07,698
And so now you don't have to be asking someone,

374
00:17:07,718 --> 00:17:08,758
can I call you on Skype?

375
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:09,359
Can we talk?

376
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:10,560
You just go in and start talking.

377
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,542
If it's a long conversation, then whoever is involved

378
00:17:13,582 --> 00:17:15,483
go into a separate room so they don't disturb everyone else,

379
00:17:15,523 --> 00:17:16,684
just like you would in a real office.

380
00:17:17,684 --> 00:17:19,606
And if it's something where I just have a question,

381
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,407
then anyone who's around could answer my question.

382
00:17:23,028 --> 00:17:25,109
The conference rooms also behave in normal conference rooms

383
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:27,011
in the sense that people can see who else is talking.

384
00:17:27,071 --> 00:17:30,113
So if I see our designer and our UI person

385
00:17:30,153 --> 00:17:31,754
having conversation, I can be like,

386
00:17:31,874 --> 00:17:33,295
oh, that's probably something I'm interested in.

387
00:17:33,555 --> 00:17:34,656
I can just drop myself in there.

388
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:38,459
And so this is kind of our like really aggressive push

389
00:17:38,499 --> 00:17:40,740
towards open, transparent conversations everywhere.

390
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:43,843
Just like on Slack where all of our channels are public.

391
00:17:44,023 --> 00:17:45,444
Every conversation is default public.

392
00:17:45,804 --> 00:17:47,405
Every conversation here is default public.

393
00:17:48,323 --> 00:17:52,146
We do have three private rooms that you're not supposed to invite yourself into,

394
00:17:52,226 --> 00:17:55,288
and those are for really feedback, like personal stuff, right?

395
00:17:55,328 --> 00:17:57,149
Like one-on-ones and like performance stuff.

396
00:17:57,629 --> 00:18:01,151
But everything else that we do is, it's an opt, it's like a,

397
00:18:01,671 --> 00:18:03,753
everyone is like default allowed into the conversation.

398
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:08,493
So that was the kind of open office.

399
00:18:08,533 --> 00:18:09,754
How do we mimic the open office?

400
00:18:10,234 --> 00:18:12,236
The second piece that we thought was really important

401
00:18:12,296 --> 00:18:15,298
to have a mimic or have like an analogy for

402
00:18:15,378 --> 00:18:17,259
was the water cooler or the hallway conversation.

403
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,601
So this is something where it's more about like

404
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:22,683
team building or it's about having different disciplines

405
00:18:22,743 --> 00:18:23,824
know what each other are doing.

406
00:18:24,325 --> 00:18:28,328
And the reason that teams like to be co-located

407
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:31,350
is that you get more dispersal ideas and for casual things.

408
00:18:33,531 --> 00:18:38,454
This is one of the problems that we really had difficulty with when we scaled from the 8 to the 10 people range.

409
00:18:38,955 --> 00:18:41,756
When we were at 8, everyone was talking to just about everyone else.

410
00:18:42,197 --> 00:18:45,939
And as we added each extra person, we started kind of dividing into smaller teams,

411
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:48,580
and we ended up with like teams of like 4 or 5.

412
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:51,362
And so people started feeling really siloed.

413
00:18:52,062 --> 00:18:54,203
and that was kind of a big issue for us.

414
00:18:54,623 --> 00:18:55,944
So our solution to this is actually,

415
00:18:55,964 --> 00:18:57,305
it's not organic, right?

416
00:18:57,365 --> 00:18:59,786
The rest of our solutions have been really technological

417
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:00,986
and organic solutions.

418
00:19:01,347 --> 00:19:02,587
This one was just process.

419
00:19:03,288 --> 00:19:06,349
So we basically said, we are going to write down

420
00:19:06,489 --> 00:19:08,130
every decision in every public channel,

421
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,711
and that's what led to all of our Slack channels

422
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:10,211
being public.

423
00:19:10,571 --> 00:19:14,553
So we said, we still want people working in the groups with the people they mostly need to talk to,

424
00:19:14,933 --> 00:19:17,915
but after every conversation, you need to tell everyone else,

425
00:19:18,035 --> 00:19:19,876
here's what we talked about and here's what we decided.

426
00:19:20,156 --> 00:19:21,977
And that needs to be in a publicly available channel.

427
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:24,899
So someone else could either just come by and see it,

428
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:28,020
or you can ping somebody and they can see the history of the conversation.

429
00:19:29,824 --> 00:19:31,947
The second one was we made all the channels public, right?

430
00:19:32,647 --> 00:19:38,994
The third one was we basically created like very formal daily and weekly updates for everyone.

431
00:19:39,354 --> 00:19:44,940
So we created a weekly update where we had every discipline talk about what they got

432
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,543
done, like what they are about to do.

433
00:19:48,423 --> 00:19:54,608
I'm sure most companies have something like that within all hands, but we basically forced it to be a bit more formal and a bit more

434
00:19:55,028 --> 00:20:01,153
robust than normal because that's the kind of contextual information that normally you would expect people to just organically get

435
00:20:01,453 --> 00:20:04,255
But when you don't see each other, that's that's not something that happens by itself

436
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:08,790
In terms of daily, we extend, like we use kind of a scrum

437
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,932
where people have a stand up and talk about what they do,

438
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,954
but we extend that into text as well.

439
00:20:13,114 --> 00:20:14,956
So everyone talks about, here's what I'm doing,

440
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:18,800
and here's what I'm doing for the rest of the week.

441
00:20:19,141 --> 00:20:20,642
And we share that across the whole team.

442
00:20:21,712 --> 00:20:24,793
We also use something called callouts, where you basically

443
00:20:25,594 --> 00:20:27,554
share things that are really cool that someone else did.

444
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:31,356
And that's specifically a low volume channel, so it's not a

445
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,477
whole lot of content each week.

446
00:20:32,877 --> 00:20:34,318
But it's shared across the whole team.

447
00:20:34,638 --> 00:20:38,760
So lots of formal tricks to get people to see what the

448
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,920
rest of the organization is doing.

449
00:20:42,629 --> 00:20:45,631
And the third one is just in-person communication,

450
00:20:45,651 --> 00:20:46,192
face-to-face.

451
00:20:46,572 --> 00:20:49,435
So what I've been talking about is mostly text and voice,

452
00:20:49,555 --> 00:20:51,597
which is 90% of what we're doing.

453
00:20:51,937 --> 00:20:54,779
But there is obviously still a place for the in-person stuff.

454
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,902
And the two biggest things is, one, creative conversations,

455
00:20:57,942 --> 00:21:00,044
where you need the gestures, the facial expressions,

456
00:21:00,064 --> 00:21:03,507
the full range of communication, like motions and emotion,

457
00:21:03,768 --> 00:21:04,328
to communicate.

458
00:21:04,668 --> 00:21:06,070
So for that, we still use Skype.

459
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,051
And for feedback sessions, where it's

460
00:21:08,071 --> 00:21:08,232
kind of

461
00:21:09,713 --> 00:21:10,874
Personal, it gets intense.

462
00:21:11,594 --> 00:21:13,195
Helps a lot to be able to make eye contact,

463
00:21:13,275 --> 00:21:15,157
even if it's through like a video screen.

464
00:21:16,338 --> 00:21:20,060
We also try to have as many in-person meetings as possible

465
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,381
when we can get people together.

466
00:21:22,302 --> 00:21:25,324
It's hard when there's no like center for us

467
00:21:25,364 --> 00:21:26,825
to be like, this is the convenient place

468
00:21:26,905 --> 00:21:27,526
everyone can get to.

469
00:21:28,006 --> 00:21:30,668
But we'll have smaller meetups for people

470
00:21:30,688 --> 00:21:33,350
that are like kind of all in Europe or all in North America.

471
00:21:34,271 --> 00:21:37,433
We had a session where a couple of us worked from France for a couple of weeks.

472
00:21:37,453 --> 00:21:41,036
That was really fun. Got to get to the lifestyle thing and got to actually meet and bond.

473
00:21:42,017 --> 00:21:46,160
We recently had our producer who's out in England come over here and meet with our art director for a week.

474
00:21:46,801 --> 00:21:50,844
And that was really good for just like spending time together. So those things are still important.

475
00:21:50,884 --> 00:21:55,387
We still need that in order to like build the relationships and build kind of interpersonal trust.

476
00:21:56,268 --> 00:21:58,130
But it's kind of like an addition to everything else.

477
00:22:02,022 --> 00:22:03,623
And then finally we have like the whiteboard.

478
00:22:03,643 --> 00:22:08,906
A lot of teams use the whiteboard as a single common visual reference for

479
00:22:09,146 --> 00:22:11,787
what is our priority, what are we working on, what are our goals.

480
00:22:12,388 --> 00:22:14,269
And this kind of goes in line with like

481
00:22:14,749 --> 00:22:16,790
communicating context gets harder online.

482
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,571
So for us, it's a combination of Trello

483
00:22:20,152 --> 00:22:22,893
and the meetings that I talked about where we formally step through everything.

484
00:22:23,654 --> 00:22:28,057
Trello is really nice because we have every single person's tasks on there and we also have our roadmap on there.

485
00:22:28,357 --> 00:22:30,879
So it's another opportunity for people to

486
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,203
like eavesdrop on what everyone else is doing and see the context of what our overall plan is.

487
00:22:42,502 --> 00:22:44,223
Three more tactical little things here.

488
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:46,085
One is we have the Scrum channel, right?

489
00:22:46,105 --> 00:22:48,867
I talked about that, where in addition to our verbal update,

490
00:22:48,908 --> 00:22:50,829
we have a very short daily Scrum update.

491
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,891
That's also nice for people who work

492
00:22:52,991 --> 00:22:54,592
on the different time zones, especially artists

493
00:22:54,693 --> 00:22:55,814
who aren't working at the same time,

494
00:22:56,234 --> 00:22:57,615
so that there's kind of a history

495
00:22:57,675 --> 00:22:59,417
and more a public accountability of,

496
00:22:59,757 --> 00:23:01,839
here's what I said I would do, here's what I've done,

497
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:02,640
here's what I'm going to do.

498
00:23:03,793 --> 00:23:07,574
We have an AFK channel so that people can feel good about coming and leaving.

499
00:23:07,994 --> 00:23:12,174
This is one of those places where whoever the leadership of the team is really needs to set an example.

500
00:23:12,214 --> 00:23:17,716
Like if you're leaving and you're doing something personal, you need to demonstrate that it's okay to go out and do something personal in the middle of the day,

501
00:23:18,056 --> 00:23:20,736
as long as you're being transparent about it, as long as you still get your work done.

502
00:23:21,596 --> 00:23:24,737
And it's also one of the ways to model the fact that, like, we believe in the culture,

503
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:28,698
and we're not just saying, like, oh, you have flexibility, we're doing it, and saying that it's okay.

504
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:32,838
And then priorities and production update is what we talked about already.

505
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,235
I talked about the time zone.

506
00:23:37,776 --> 00:23:39,560
We found that it's best just to pick a single one

507
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,301
that people work from.

508
00:23:42,586 --> 00:23:43,948
So that was a lot of operational stuff,

509
00:23:44,029 --> 00:23:46,413
like tactical execution, how do we get stuff done.

510
00:23:48,441 --> 00:23:50,602
The kind of final bit is really culture.

511
00:23:50,642 --> 00:23:52,864
And culture, I mean, every team has to build culture,

512
00:23:52,924 --> 00:23:54,705
regardless if you're remote or co-located.

513
00:23:54,986 --> 00:23:56,367
But we have to work a little bit harder

514
00:23:56,407 --> 00:23:57,567
on a remote team to build culture.

515
00:23:57,948 --> 00:24:00,169
So the kind of in-person gathering that I talked about

516
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:00,990
is a big part of it.

517
00:24:01,811 --> 00:24:03,912
One thing that we found really useful is having game night.

518
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:07,575
So we actually try to say, like, after our all-hands,

519
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:09,917
we try to say, okay, all right, let's not work for an hour,

520
00:24:10,037 --> 00:24:11,318
play a game, play any game,

521
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:12,659
like just do it with someone else,

522
00:24:13,479 --> 00:24:14,740
and we'll pay for whatever the games are.

523
00:24:15,941 --> 00:24:20,903
people seem like... yeah, it seems like it's a good way to bond. We've had like D&D sessions,

524
00:24:20,923 --> 00:24:26,745
we've had Minecraft, we've had Heroes of the Storm obviously. Another one that was kind of a

525
00:24:26,785 --> 00:24:30,747
surprise to me but really shouldn't have been is that we had a photo sharing channel and that was

526
00:24:30,787 --> 00:24:35,369
like wildly popular. It's probably the best bonding like method that we've had. People

527
00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:39,831
really just like sharing and if you just copy Facebook but make it kind of in your team...

528
00:24:41,556 --> 00:24:47,058
it really fills the gap where we want to have our personal lives mixed with our work

529
00:24:47,098 --> 00:24:48,399
and we like the people that we work with.

530
00:24:48,979 --> 00:24:54,341
And Facebook really isn't targeted enough to share some of the more crazy things that you're doing

531
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:55,382
or shared interests.

532
00:24:55,822 --> 00:24:58,423
So that was a big useful one.

533
00:25:00,824 --> 00:25:02,704
And then finally, be clear about the rules.

534
00:25:02,744 --> 00:25:04,345
So this one is...

535
00:25:05,562 --> 00:25:10,930
Kind of what I talked about with the afk channel where kind of the leadership needs to model the behavior that you think is good

536
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:12,473
We want to

537
00:25:13,254 --> 00:25:17,581
We want to have like a culture right which includes all these unspoken things all these things under the surface

538
00:25:18,565 --> 00:25:21,006
But we can't just allow all of that to develop on its own,

539
00:25:21,046 --> 00:25:23,907
because people are generally going to be hesitant about it.

540
00:25:23,927 --> 00:25:24,707
They don't want to feel like they're

541
00:25:24,727 --> 00:25:25,707
taking advantage of the system.

542
00:25:25,727 --> 00:25:27,028
They don't want to feel like they're letting

543
00:25:27,048 --> 00:25:27,848
the rest of their team down.

544
00:25:28,268 --> 00:25:31,189
So having even a small set of rules that are explicit,

545
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:33,230
like these things are OK, these things you should do,

546
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:36,291
and saying it, allows the rest of the unspoken things

547
00:25:36,311 --> 00:25:37,611
to develop more organically.

548
00:25:40,152 --> 00:25:40,372
Cool.

549
00:25:40,392 --> 00:25:41,732
So it looks like that's pretty much it.

550
00:25:42,132 --> 00:25:43,553
I have five minutes left, if anyone

551
00:25:43,573 --> 00:25:44,993
wants to ask any questions.

552
00:25:47,394 --> 00:25:47,594
Thank you.

553
00:25:47,614 --> 00:25:47,794
Thank you.

554
00:25:54,361 --> 00:25:57,010
Yeah, I just wanted to, great talk by the way, thank you.

555
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,474
I'm super interested in this stuff.

556
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:04,677
Could you just be a little bit more specific about, you said you formalized the weekly updates.

557
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:09,539
I wasn't clear on what form those actually took.

558
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:17,243
Sure, so we start with having the, like, our producer or dev producer talk about what everything, what specific tasks got done.

559
00:26:17,783 --> 00:26:21,525
We talk about the roadmap for the next, like, month formally.

560
00:26:21,605 --> 00:26:24,506
So, like, here are the releases that are coming out, here's exactly what's going into it.

561
00:26:25,266 --> 00:26:26,887
We call out the people that did the work.

562
00:26:26,927 --> 00:26:28,548
So it can be pretty tedious, right?

563
00:26:28,568 --> 00:26:30,790
Where we go through what each person did for each release.

564
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:34,172
But the point is to let the devs know,

565
00:26:34,232 --> 00:26:35,233
here's what the artists are doing

566
00:26:35,253 --> 00:26:35,993
to contribute to the release.

567
00:26:36,033 --> 00:26:37,574
Let the artists know, here's what the devs are doing

568
00:26:37,634 --> 00:26:39,896
to make the art that you made really go into it.

569
00:26:39,976 --> 00:26:42,818
And so we actually go through a pretty thorough thing

570
00:26:42,898 --> 00:26:44,719
of here's what everyone did to do everything.

571
00:26:45,259 --> 00:26:47,541
And on a normal team, I think that it feels like a waste of time.

572
00:26:48,342 --> 00:26:50,804
But we found that even if it takes an extra half hour, hour,

573
00:26:51,045 --> 00:26:54,187
that that level of detail on each release, what we have done,

574
00:26:54,288 --> 00:26:57,230
and then what we are about to do, and who's doing what on each release,

575
00:26:57,631 --> 00:26:58,251
is really useful.

576
00:26:58,271 --> 00:26:58,772
Yeah.

577
00:27:01,034 --> 00:27:02,615
Oh, no, it's on a weekly call.

578
00:27:03,616 --> 00:27:03,776
Yeah.

579
00:27:04,157 --> 00:27:07,420
And we also record it for the people that aren't on at the same time.

580
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,162
So we just have a recording, and people can listen to it afterwards as a podcast.

581
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,631
Hi, thank you for your talk.

582
00:27:14,472 --> 00:27:16,095
I have a pretty large remote team

583
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,797
with varying degrees of tech savvy.

584
00:27:18,218 --> 00:27:20,060
And sometimes I feel a little bit of resistance

585
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,083
to change when I try to incorporate a new tool.

586
00:27:22,343 --> 00:27:24,046
I know you mentioned quite a lot of tools.

587
00:27:24,066 --> 00:27:26,169
Do you have any tips for sort of getting your team ready

588
00:27:26,209 --> 00:27:27,330
to adapt to those changes?

589
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,532
How big is your team?

590
00:27:28,993 --> 00:27:29,453
About 10.

591
00:27:30,213 --> 00:27:35,576
Okay. So, um, yeah, it was, it was a pain. Like we switched like the voice chat thing.

592
00:27:35,636 --> 00:27:40,099
I said, where we use team speak, I literally switched chat systems, my team four times.

593
00:27:40,199 --> 00:27:43,120
And we actually went to team seek, went to discord and went back to team speak.

594
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:46,922
And they were not happy about that. Um, I think some of it is just like with,

595
00:27:47,362 --> 00:27:50,504
when you want to make this work, you just need to push it through. So is your team,

596
00:27:50,604 --> 00:27:53,825
sorry, is your team partially remote and partially co-located or was there all?

597
00:27:54,066 --> 00:27:57,147
Yes. So there's partially three of us in the office and then there's like six others.

598
00:27:57,187 --> 00:27:59,931
So that's one of the main, like it's a really big problem actually, I think.

599
00:28:00,391 --> 00:28:04,377
When we, when I was at Zynga, I actually worked on a partially co-located, partially remote team,

600
00:28:04,717 --> 00:28:09,283
and we had a huge problem where the co-located people didn't feel the same pain that the remote people did.

601
00:28:09,683 --> 00:28:13,809
And for us, because everyone's feeling the same pain, even though it was painful doing the different transitions,

602
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:17,133
people understood this is a problem that we need to solve,

603
00:28:17,253 --> 00:28:19,095
even though this is a very painful process,

604
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:20,356
we need to go through it together.

605
00:28:21,297 --> 00:28:23,400
So I don't have specific first-hand advice

606
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,621
on how to do this, but I would say that

607
00:28:24,841 --> 00:28:27,204
the more you can get the co-located team

608
00:28:27,404 --> 00:28:29,487
to feel the pain that the remote team is having,

609
00:28:29,527 --> 00:28:31,609
I think that'll be a good way to get everyone

610
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,312
on the same page, and they'll be more open

611
00:28:34,352 --> 00:28:35,594
to experimenting for a solution.

612
00:28:36,354 --> 00:28:36,575
Thank you.

613
00:28:39,475 --> 00:28:43,316
Hi, I was wondering how you prevent work any time

614
00:28:43,456 --> 00:28:45,136
from being work all the time.

615
00:28:45,336 --> 00:28:47,237
Like how do you give people reasonable expectations

616
00:28:47,297 --> 00:28:48,937
about this is what we expect from you

617
00:28:49,178 --> 00:28:51,878
and if it's got you working more than the standard,

618
00:28:52,318 --> 00:28:54,139
well I'm gonna say 40 and we all know that's a lie,

619
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:55,699
but like the standard 60 hours a week.

620
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:57,000
Like tell me that that's,

621
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,920
like how do you manage that kind of scheduling?

622
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:04,583
Absolutely, and I think that's one of the things where I say it's important for the leadership to set the rules and follow the rules

623
00:29:05,003 --> 00:29:07,405
So we have the scrum in and scrum out chat

624
00:29:07,805 --> 00:29:10,946
And so when we come in we say like I'm starting work now, right?

625
00:29:10,966 --> 00:29:14,668
Like I I'm starting work late today because I had to do something or like no I'm starting on time today

626
00:29:15,028 --> 00:29:19,731
And then when we leave we say I'm out for the day. So especially for me and my co-founder

627
00:29:20,031 --> 00:29:21,131
We really try to like

628
00:29:21,692 --> 00:29:26,014
to model that. If I'm starting work late, I'm just like, I'm starting work late today.

629
00:29:26,354 --> 00:29:29,876
If I leave and I'm going to go play frisbee for four hours, that's what I say.

630
00:29:30,216 --> 00:29:34,098
And so I think that a lot of that just comes from what the leadership does and how they

631
00:29:34,138 --> 00:29:39,801
demonstrate this. We do actually work a lot. One of the problems with Slack is that you can

632
00:29:39,841 --> 00:29:42,643
be working everywhere. I was texting my team on Slack right before this talk.

633
00:29:43,563 --> 00:29:45,745
I think that to some extent it's okay if it's healthy,

634
00:29:46,185 --> 00:29:48,407
and the main thing is to respect the core hours.

635
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:50,728
So because we set everyone to Pacific time hours,

636
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:52,149
we expect people to be around,

637
00:29:52,209 --> 00:29:53,971
and it's okay if you have a reason for not being there,

638
00:29:54,031 --> 00:29:55,432
but that's really when we expect you to work.

639
00:29:55,912 --> 00:29:58,294
And if you're kind of past that,

640
00:29:58,474 --> 00:30:01,356
and we don't expect people to be responsive at that time.

641
00:30:01,456 --> 00:30:03,598
And it's really coming from how you model the behavior.

642
00:30:03,618 --> 00:30:04,578
Okay, thank you.

643
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:07,460
Hello.

644
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:13,980
I work on Call of Duty, so for us, like, security and preventing everything from leaking is really important.

645
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:21,282
And when it comes to working remote, I find that having, like, all the VPN and all this stuff in to protect my data are really a problem.

646
00:30:21,362 --> 00:30:29,304
Is it something that you care about doing when working remote, or do you, like, play the bet of nobody's gonna do that?

647
00:30:29,544 --> 00:30:33,848
I think we probably play a bit faster and looser with data security than you guys do.

648
00:30:34,328 --> 00:30:38,231
We make mobile slots games and there's like a million mobile slots games on the market.

649
00:30:39,012 --> 00:30:43,055
We are fairly careful with our art in the sense that we have like...

650
00:30:44,036 --> 00:30:46,298
we're able to do stuff like removing it from Dropbox.

651
00:30:46,358 --> 00:30:48,920
But like if somebody really wants to mess with your content,

652
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,362
like anyone, doesn't matter if they're remote or co-located,

653
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:54,685
I feel like if someone is maliciously trying to do something or trying to steal something...

654
00:30:55,205 --> 00:30:57,546
I don't think it's actually that easy to stop, regardless of what we do.

655
00:30:57,946 --> 00:31:02,367
So we've pretty much just based this on like, if, if we give you access to it,

656
00:31:02,408 --> 00:31:03,628
then we trust you to not screw with it.

657
00:31:05,228 --> 00:31:05,428
Great.

658
00:31:05,468 --> 00:31:05,748
Thank you.

659
00:31:07,249 --> 00:31:07,369
Yeah.

660
00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:07,589
Hi.

661
00:31:07,629 --> 00:31:08,089
Great talk.

662
00:31:08,149 --> 00:31:08,369
Thanks.

663
00:31:08,969 --> 00:31:12,170
You said you have approximately 30 people in the team in total.

664
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:16,092
So how many developers and how many game artists and do you split them to the

665
00:31:16,112 --> 00:31:18,372
teams when they work on the different products maybe?

666
00:31:19,017 --> 00:31:23,799
Sure, so we have like five or six devs,

667
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,701
like a dozen artists and designers,

668
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:30,743
and then we have like kind of me, design,

669
00:31:31,003 --> 00:31:33,544
couple UI, sound, like some miscellaneous people.

670
00:31:34,364 --> 00:31:36,365
So the core development team is like six.

671
00:31:37,686 --> 00:31:41,728
We work on, we do only slot stuff, so everything is on a

672
00:31:41,788 --> 00:31:43,189
single core engine.

673
00:31:43,209 --> 00:31:46,411
So we have one GitHub repo that most of our code is in.

674
00:31:47,192 --> 00:31:49,594
We have a dozen different games, though.

675
00:31:49,734 --> 00:31:51,975
So in terms of art, we actually have a lot of

676
00:31:51,995 --> 00:31:53,876
different art pipelines that are happening at the same time.

677
00:31:54,156 --> 00:31:56,758
So we manage our art pipeline pretty separately from the dev

678
00:31:56,778 --> 00:31:57,178
pipeline.

679
00:31:57,799 --> 00:31:59,120
Was that to answer your question?

680
00:31:59,340 --> 00:31:59,560
Thanks.

681
00:32:02,262 --> 00:32:03,823
All right, maybe last one.

682
00:32:04,493 --> 00:32:07,515
Hey, I wanted to know kind of how you get leadership involved

683
00:32:07,555 --> 00:32:08,935
in these communication pieces.

684
00:32:09,035 --> 00:32:11,176
Because I think one of the problems that we most frequently

685
00:32:11,216 --> 00:32:15,338
have is that we need feedback from business leaders

686
00:32:15,438 --> 00:32:18,559
or different members of some of our other distributed teams

687
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:21,000
that don't typically get in on the day-to-day work that's

688
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,860
done by the teams.

689
00:32:22,301 --> 00:32:24,501
Getting our teams to communicate is easy.

690
00:32:24,581 --> 00:32:26,602
Getting our leaders to communicate with the teams

691
00:32:26,722 --> 00:32:29,283
or even with each other is very difficult. Any advice?

692
00:32:30,107 --> 00:32:32,028
What type of communication are you referring to specifically?

693
00:32:32,148 --> 00:32:36,130
So, you know, if we need to have business deals being made, I work for PlayStation,

694
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:41,012
so, you know, we have different, you know, potentially new, you know, game discussions

695
00:32:41,032 --> 00:32:43,693
that happen to come out or, you know, platform decisions, things like that.

696
00:32:44,167 --> 00:32:46,287
Yeah, so it's hard.

697
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:51,608
Because I do most of our organizing the weekly meetings,

698
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:53,768
I feel an obligation each week to say stuff

699
00:32:53,808 --> 00:32:54,489
about what's going on.

700
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:56,629
But definitely a lot of the other leaders

701
00:32:56,649 --> 00:32:58,429
in the different disciplines get lazy about it.

702
00:32:58,709 --> 00:32:59,750
So what I do is I just call them out.

703
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:03,290
I'm like, you need to say something about this next week.

704
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:06,251
Or be ready for me to ask you and tell everyone else what's

705
00:33:06,271 --> 00:33:08,031
going on, because I know there's something big.

706
00:33:08,391 --> 00:33:09,751
I think that just whoever is running it

707
00:33:09,791 --> 00:33:11,532
needs to be able to call out people for,

708
00:33:11,592 --> 00:33:13,192
I think there's something interesting going

709
00:33:13,212 --> 00:33:13,872
on in your department.

710
00:33:14,113 --> 00:33:14,815
say something about it.

711
00:33:14,835 --> 00:33:16,160
Cool, thank you.

712
00:33:17,304 --> 00:33:17,946
All right, thanks everyone.
