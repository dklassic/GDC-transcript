1
00:00:08,423 --> 00:00:09,584
So, yes, first time.

2
00:00:12,665 --> 00:00:13,505
OK, awesome.

3
00:00:13,945 --> 00:00:15,226
I did not know WriteClub's happening.

4
00:00:15,386 --> 00:00:15,826
I'm excited.

5
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:17,246
Maybe I can redeem myself this year,

6
00:00:17,286 --> 00:00:21,408
since I came in a really close fifth last time.

7
00:00:22,448 --> 00:00:23,368
Really close, I swore.

8
00:00:25,389 --> 00:00:27,049
OK, so thank you.

9
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:29,450
I'm pleasantly surprised to have this big a crowd.

10
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,491
When I saw the crowd outside the other room, I was like, OK.

11
00:00:32,391 --> 00:00:32,891
I'm forgotten.

12
00:00:33,531 --> 00:00:34,472
Thank you for not forgetting me.

13
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:36,730
So who am I?

14
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:39,571
I'm a narrative design researcher.

15
00:00:40,691 --> 00:00:41,291
Is this loud enough?

16
00:00:41,552 --> 00:00:41,832
We good?

17
00:00:42,632 --> 00:00:42,832
OK.

18
00:00:43,952 --> 00:00:46,293
The long answer is I'm a film student turned web designer,

19
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:48,013
turned art student, turned comic screenwriter,

20
00:00:48,033 --> 00:00:49,573
turned programming teacher, turned blah, blah, blah, blah,

21
00:00:49,593 --> 00:00:52,074
blah, blah, blah, turned narrative design researcher.

22
00:00:53,234 --> 00:00:54,354
This is why editing is important.

23
00:00:56,275 --> 00:00:58,255
Point is, I did a lot of stuff, came around

24
00:00:58,295 --> 00:01:00,096
to narrative design, and now that's

25
00:01:00,196 --> 00:01:03,256
what I call myself because explaining all of this

26
00:01:03,536 --> 00:01:03,957
is tough.

27
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:06,351
but who are you?

28
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,173
So just a show of hands,

29
00:01:09,553 --> 00:01:11,955
who here has written any interactive narrative,

30
00:01:11,995 --> 00:01:13,216
worked on a game, anything?

31
00:01:13,236 --> 00:01:14,537
Okay, good.

32
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:18,559
Who's designed an interactive narrative?

33
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,581
Okay.

34
00:01:21,782 --> 00:01:23,803
I may get to skip ahead on a lot of slides here.

35
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:26,585
Who's mapped an interactive narrative,

36
00:01:26,705 --> 00:01:28,526
like actually made maps for it?

37
00:01:28,607 --> 00:01:29,687
Okay, a few of you.

38
00:01:29,707 --> 00:01:29,787
Okay.

39
00:01:32,142 --> 00:01:33,603
I'll tell you guys when you can fall asleep then.

40
00:01:34,643 --> 00:01:36,764
And who's coded an interactive narrative?

41
00:01:37,724 --> 00:01:39,105
Yay, some ear-coding hands.

42
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:39,785
I always love those.

43
00:01:41,425 --> 00:01:42,526
OK.

44
00:01:42,706 --> 00:01:43,106
Twine?

45
00:01:44,306 --> 00:01:44,546
OK.

46
00:01:44,926 --> 00:01:45,467
Other tools?

47
00:01:48,027 --> 00:01:48,327
OK.

48
00:01:48,588 --> 00:01:48,848
Awesome.

49
00:01:49,768 --> 00:01:51,208
I still have to spend some time.

50
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:51,649
What?

51
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:54,169
If the twine counts, then sure.

52
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:54,409
Yeah.

53
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,550
Well, twine can't count.

54
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:57,530
Anyway.

55
00:01:58,331 --> 00:01:58,431
OK.

56
00:02:00,498 --> 00:02:02,399
So as you saw from that earlier slide,

57
00:02:02,419 --> 00:02:06,022
I have a lot of different things that I do in life

58
00:02:06,522 --> 00:02:07,102
and have done.

59
00:02:07,703 --> 00:02:09,364
But the one that I figured I'd focus on today

60
00:02:09,484 --> 00:02:10,885
is this annual challenge that I have,

61
00:02:11,085 --> 00:02:14,167
where every year in January and March,

62
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:18,070
I get 60 new digital media graduate students, most of whom

63
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:21,792
have had one programming class, one visual design class,

64
00:02:22,693 --> 00:02:23,814
zero creative writing classes.

65
00:02:24,094 --> 00:02:27,156
And 75% of them are in their first year

66
00:02:27,236 --> 00:02:28,497
of speaking English full time.

67
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:31,330
So it's a bit of a challenge.

68
00:02:31,811 --> 00:02:33,292
The last bit was kind of an accident.

69
00:02:33,332 --> 00:02:34,453
We thought it would be really cool

70
00:02:34,493 --> 00:02:35,995
to make our program more international,

71
00:02:36,835 --> 00:02:38,317
and we learned, careful what you wish for,

72
00:02:38,357 --> 00:02:40,259
because our program is very international,

73
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:43,021
and it's super cool, but it's a challenge.

74
00:02:44,743 --> 00:02:46,684
So over the course of 12 weeks

75
00:02:46,765 --> 00:02:48,606
with these relatively fresh faces,

76
00:02:48,846 --> 00:02:51,429
I asked them to create an interactive multimedia narrative

77
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,931
that is not a simple choose-your-own-adventure.

78
00:02:55,115 --> 00:02:59,477
It must not be game first, which is to say it has to be really about story.

79
00:03:01,077 --> 00:03:03,138
It has to be a good experience the first time you play it,

80
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:08,979
not necessarily a positive one, but an enjoyable, in whatever sense, one, engaging.

81
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,400
And it must invite replayability.

82
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,721
Oh, and also they have to learn three-act dramatic structure,

83
00:03:15,781 --> 00:03:18,802
learn character archetypes, learn basic screenwriting, cinematography,

84
00:03:18,882 --> 00:03:21,303
editing, and directing principles in the same 12 weeks.

85
00:03:24,718 --> 00:03:30,382
But somehow out of all of that, it's the prohibition against choose your own adventure that seems to actually freak them out the most.

86
00:03:32,243 --> 00:03:35,545
Which really confused me, but that caused me to go down this line of research.

87
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:42,309
So, then they go home and think about it, and at least a quarter of them actually come up with something kind of brilliant.

88
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,093
Usually things that would take at least a year to produce, but brilliant ideas.

89
00:03:49,422 --> 00:03:51,363
Usually we end up teaming the students up

90
00:03:51,383 --> 00:03:52,423
into groups of four or five,

91
00:03:52,564 --> 00:03:55,385
and we try to build small parts of those projects,

92
00:03:56,105 --> 00:03:57,966
trying to get them to scale back expectations.

93
00:04:00,047 --> 00:04:01,008
And sometimes they don't,

94
00:04:01,088 --> 00:04:02,489
and we get some glorious train wrecks.

95
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:04,410
I should say, I have not timed these remarks

96
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,331
to these slides, so these are not necessarily

97
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,231
the glorious train wrecks.

98
00:04:09,973 --> 00:04:12,054
But often there are some amazing moments of insight

99
00:04:12,114 --> 00:04:13,214
and some accidental brilliance,

100
00:04:13,554 --> 00:04:14,995
probably some intentional brilliance too

101
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:16,456
that we don't recognize until later.

102
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:22,802
So the weird thing is that again and again during the project,

103
00:04:23,342 --> 00:04:25,305
students come back to this idea of how

104
00:04:25,345 --> 00:04:27,026
do you give meaningful choices without it

105
00:04:27,046 --> 00:04:28,087
being a choose your own adventure.

106
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:31,291
And you guys know the answer to this.

107
00:04:31,992 --> 00:04:34,654
And we give them examples ranging from Alabaster

108
00:04:34,754 --> 00:04:36,196
to the Zombies of the Walking Dead.

109
00:04:36,456 --> 00:04:40,500
And they say, so we just have to add some action

110
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,723
to our choose your own adventure, maybe a mini game?

111
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:50,010
So then we go to F and G, used to be facade,

112
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:53,212
now it's fire watch for F, G being gone home of course,

113
00:04:54,393 --> 00:04:55,874
which students especially latch on to,

114
00:04:55,894 --> 00:04:57,635
which I find incredibly gratifying.

115
00:04:59,115 --> 00:05:01,177
And then they all decide they're gonna make a story

116
00:05:01,237 --> 00:05:02,697
about memories triggered by objects

117
00:05:02,737 --> 00:05:04,098
and therefore that must be amnesia

118
00:05:04,158 --> 00:05:06,379
and therefore we end up with 14 proposals

119
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:07,700
for stories about amnesia.

120
00:05:09,592 --> 00:05:11,233
And at first, we kind of wondered

121
00:05:11,253 --> 00:05:13,875
if this was maybe just because the starting

122
00:05:13,915 --> 00:05:15,816
point for New Riders of Interactive Fiction is

123
00:05:15,896 --> 00:05:16,977
the last game they played.

124
00:05:18,358 --> 00:05:22,181
But then we realized, because my main co-teacher and I

125
00:05:22,241 --> 00:05:27,544
are with it a decade of each other, a lot of these

126
00:05:27,585 --> 00:05:29,706
reminded us of games that we played way back

127
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:30,387
when we were kids.

128
00:05:32,688 --> 00:05:34,670
So we actually began to wonder if maybe the problem was

129
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,871
that a lot of our students don't have a sense of video game

130
00:05:36,891 --> 00:05:37,231
history.

131
00:05:39,387 --> 00:05:41,867
But that seemed kind of odd because a lot of our students

132
00:05:42,167 --> 00:05:43,728
are in their early 20s, but we also

133
00:05:43,768 --> 00:05:45,488
have some that are near retirement age.

134
00:05:46,749 --> 00:05:49,270
2 3rds of them come from China, India, North Africa, South

135
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,010
America.

136
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,231
There's such a diverse range of cultures and experiences

137
00:05:53,331 --> 00:05:54,951
and games that could influence their stories.

138
00:05:55,552 --> 00:05:57,592
We wondered, why did a quarter of the projects

139
00:05:57,652 --> 00:06:00,333
keep ending up being detective stories or amnesia stories?

140
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,381
This is territory that's been covered.

141
00:06:03,641 --> 00:06:06,042
There are still, I'm sure, many awesome amnesia stories

142
00:06:06,062 --> 00:06:07,903
to be told, and I love a good mystery.

143
00:06:08,783 --> 00:06:11,824
But we wanted to kind of see if maybe there's

144
00:06:11,844 --> 00:06:12,564
something else they could do.

145
00:06:17,786 --> 00:06:19,627
So this is the point when I actually

146
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:22,308
started looking at their maps, such as the one

147
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:24,229
over there on the right.

148
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:24,989
Sorry, the left.

149
00:06:27,192 --> 00:06:29,393
And I started looking at sort of classic adventure maps.

150
00:06:29,453 --> 00:06:31,054
That's actually part of Planetfall,

151
00:06:31,074 --> 00:06:32,154
I believe, on the other side there.

152
00:06:33,234 --> 00:06:37,496
And we realized that basically we'd

153
00:06:37,516 --> 00:06:39,636
been sort of treating the story maps as site maps.

154
00:06:40,056 --> 00:06:42,537
So they were basically kind of saying, oh, well,

155
00:06:42,557 --> 00:06:43,558
we're going to put this on the internet,

156
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:44,598
so it'll be a web page.

157
00:06:44,698 --> 00:06:46,118
So we'll make home pages.

158
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,199
You can see home page over there.

159
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:51,560
And that wasn't really giving a sense of story

160
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,741
or a sense of place.

161
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:57,938
But when we tried to actually get them to map out things in terms of place, then we ended up with basically...

162
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,267
Well, I wish we ended up with Planetfall, but, you know, we ended up with sort of maps.

163
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:06,149
And basically we'd end up with the classic inventory

164
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,292
oriented adventure game kind of thing that is great

165
00:07:09,352 --> 00:07:11,933
and I love playing, but again, since this class

166
00:07:11,994 --> 00:07:14,155
was interactive narrative, we wanted to sort of

167
00:07:14,195 --> 00:07:16,597
do something more, which is why I wanted to do this talk,

168
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,939
because I really wanted to sort of show a situation

169
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:20,720
where we're really pushing on this idea of,

170
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,821
no, you can't make a game.

171
00:07:23,362 --> 00:07:25,503
I mean, I would love it if I could tell the students,

172
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,064
ha ha, just kidding, you can make games now,

173
00:07:27,084 --> 00:07:28,946
because I love playing the games they make.

174
00:07:29,695 --> 00:07:32,058
but instead have to be the mean teacher who's like,

175
00:07:32,138 --> 00:07:33,879
no, this quarter, no games.

176
00:07:36,201 --> 00:07:38,844
So as I mentioned, we were trying

177
00:07:38,904 --> 00:07:41,346
to have them work with existing tools.

178
00:07:42,066 --> 00:07:43,167
And with the tight time crunch, we

179
00:07:43,207 --> 00:07:45,149
discovered that they often were just sort of using

180
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:47,031
the tutorials and saying, oh, well,

181
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:48,973
since the Undone tutorial has hit points,

182
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:50,053
then we have to have hit points.

183
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,275
And that must be how these things work.

184
00:07:53,216 --> 00:07:56,697
So it was sort of a strange variation on the whole language shapes thought thing

185
00:07:56,737 --> 00:08:01,320
I don't know if you guys went to the session yesterday about writing if English is your second language

186
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:08,824
But here we had two cases of English is the second language plus programming is a second language. So it was kind of a pain

187
00:08:09,985 --> 00:08:11,225
But then we had the overachievers

188
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,714
So these two groups, which I just put side by side

189
00:08:30,734 --> 00:08:34,896
to show quick clips, produced a fully interactive

190
00:08:34,936 --> 00:08:37,517
top-down prototype and a fully produced cut scene

191
00:08:37,677 --> 00:08:38,978
in the first week of the project.

192
00:08:39,098 --> 00:08:42,259
So we're expecting, you know, sketch prototypes

193
00:08:42,319 --> 00:08:44,520
and these students are jumping ahead to this.

194
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:47,601
But it's actually the advanced groups

195
00:08:47,681 --> 00:08:49,482
that I was more worried about

196
00:08:49,722 --> 00:08:51,463
and why I really wanted to do this mapping thing.

197
00:08:52,523 --> 00:08:54,104
Okay, another quick survey question.

198
00:08:54,384 --> 00:08:56,305
Who's played a really good looking game

199
00:08:56,325 --> 00:08:57,566
that just didn't make sense?

200
00:08:59,502 --> 00:09:04,847
Okay. Who's been sorely disappointed by a game that you know has some amazing programming

201
00:09:04,887 --> 00:09:16,297
behind it or some amazing ideas and it's just awkward? Yeah, okay.

202
00:09:16,317 --> 00:09:21,481
So My Secret Shame, I've never finished Heavy Rain, it's the only game where I've ever actually

203
00:09:21,521 --> 00:09:26,065
given up and read the walkthrough and watched the YouTube videos because I just could not

204
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:26,646
deal.

205
00:09:28,189 --> 00:09:31,772
I love a lot that's going on, and this is not a bash Heavy Rain session.

206
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:37,177
In fact, one of the things that I had to cut from this talk for length is a re-engineering

207
00:09:37,217 --> 00:09:41,120
of Heavy Rain that some students and I have been trying to work on.

208
00:09:41,501 --> 00:09:43,983
It's a theoretical exercise, we're not going to actually, like, make it.

209
00:09:45,704 --> 00:09:47,206
But we think there's enough good stuff in there.

210
00:09:47,246 --> 00:09:51,230
But the point is, it's difficult, as I'm sure many of you can appreciate.

211
00:09:52,603 --> 00:09:54,404
In fact, this is sort of the remnants

212
00:09:54,484 --> 00:09:55,905
of that part of the talk that I took out.

213
00:09:56,645 --> 00:10:00,046
This was our starting map for how heavy rain works.

214
00:10:01,126 --> 00:10:02,947
And without going into details,

215
00:10:03,007 --> 00:10:05,067
and there are no spoilers in case you haven't played it

216
00:10:05,087 --> 00:10:07,748
in the last six years, in which case, get on that.

217
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,770
But the dark area is actually the only part

218
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,451
where there's really a lot of evidence

219
00:10:15,871 --> 00:10:17,031
that you're having an impact on the world.

220
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:18,672
There's sort of the minor touches

221
00:10:18,712 --> 00:10:19,792
that happened in the first part.

222
00:10:21,257 --> 00:10:26,098
And that's roughly three quarters of the story that takes place with you only sort of having

223
00:10:26,138 --> 00:10:29,859
these sort of cosmetic changes and being led through the story.

224
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:35,000
And by the time you actually get to that part where it's super amazing what's going on,

225
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,880
you've cut off your finger, you've calmed a crying baby, you've microwaved a pizza,

226
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,161
you've set the table, you've run around yelling like a madman like five times.

227
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:46,062
And so in my case, I just didn't make it to the end.

228
00:10:46,322 --> 00:10:48,722
Just out of curiosity, how many people did make it to the end of Heavy Rain?

229
00:10:49,943 --> 00:10:50,223
Awesome.

230
00:10:50,243 --> 00:10:51,063
You're better people than I am.

231
00:10:54,433 --> 00:10:55,934
So this goes without saying for this crowd,

232
00:10:55,974 --> 00:10:58,156
but good stories have a beginning, a middle, and an end.

233
00:10:59,216 --> 00:11:01,657
And the reason we worry so much about mapping,

234
00:11:01,717 --> 00:11:03,498
or at least I do, and my group does,

235
00:11:03,678 --> 00:11:06,120
is because we want players to reach the end.

236
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,002
Or at least a stopping point where they feel happy.

237
00:11:12,703 --> 00:11:13,044
Usually.

238
00:11:15,665 --> 00:11:17,526
Basically, as long as they don't rage quit,

239
00:11:17,806 --> 00:11:20,167
and they say, okay, I'm stopping because

240
00:11:20,187 --> 00:11:22,389
I appreciate what's going on here,

241
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:24,170
I'm okay if they don't get to the end.

242
00:11:26,806 --> 00:11:29,267
So this next part is the part where I might

243
00:11:29,307 --> 00:11:30,148
fast forward a little bit.

244
00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:33,609
I decided I would sort of go through some of the

245
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,811
basic shapes that we look at just to sort of do a

246
00:11:35,851 --> 00:11:38,892
quick orienteering guide and then do one bigger

247
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:41,313
worked example at the end, time permitting.

248
00:11:43,614 --> 00:11:46,716
So show of hands, people who are familiar with

249
00:11:46,756 --> 00:11:50,218
the diamond structure, okay.

250
00:11:51,298 --> 00:11:54,800
Loops in stories, just saying, I'm sure many of you know.

251
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,461
Okay, we'll go through these then.

252
00:11:58,255 --> 00:12:00,655
So the diamond, which was actually brought up yesterday

253
00:12:00,735 --> 00:12:03,176
in Cassie's talk about all choice, no consequences,

254
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,316
basically is the title of her talk,

255
00:12:05,436 --> 00:12:06,636
all choice, no consequences.

256
00:12:07,556 --> 00:12:08,877
You give the player a choice,

257
00:12:10,077 --> 00:12:13,497
you then give them a result from the choice,

258
00:12:14,398 --> 00:12:16,678
and then maybe you give them some choices.

259
00:12:16,978 --> 00:12:19,459
In this case, I chose to use little emoji

260
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,419
because it seemed like there is no choice, why not?

261
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,420
And you go back to the thing you're at.

262
00:12:27,016 --> 00:12:29,377
So they're great because you don't break your story,

263
00:12:29,658 --> 00:12:32,679
but at the same time, some writers and players

264
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,301
hate them because they want to break their story.

265
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:38,043
If you do this, you're sort of in the safe zone of, OK,

266
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,404
I'm just kind of leading you along through my story now,

267
00:12:40,464 --> 00:12:41,685
because every choice you make might

268
00:12:41,825 --> 00:12:44,086
customize what happens a little bit, but not too much.

269
00:12:45,888 --> 00:12:47,949
But I bring up the diamond, because even though it

270
00:12:47,989 --> 00:12:49,750
seems like kind of an obvious loopback

271
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,911
technique in the time saver.

272
00:12:51,907 --> 00:12:54,008
it's often underappreciated for the things you can do with it,

273
00:12:55,249 --> 00:12:57,671
such as giving the player a different way of interpreting

274
00:12:57,711 --> 00:13:00,573
the same events, or giving players

275
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,795
a choice between the right road, if you

276
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,236
believe in having a right road in your story,

277
00:13:04,596 --> 00:13:05,597
and the hard road.

278
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,539
So maybe you're trying to make a fail-proof game.

279
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,201
Maybe you don't believe in having the death

280
00:13:11,241 --> 00:13:12,321
thing going on in your games.

281
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:15,564
Or maybe you want to go back to the days of Infocom

282
00:13:15,604 --> 00:13:17,385
and infinite saves and restarts.

283
00:13:18,726 --> 00:13:19,247
I wouldn't mind that.

284
00:13:21,232 --> 00:13:27,454
sometimes. But anyway, so maybe you give the players one way through where they just do

285
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:30,555
the right thing, they solve the puzzle, whatever you're on, and then the other way is, okay,

286
00:13:30,575 --> 00:13:36,477
you gotta do a whole bunch of stuff if you're gonna get there. This is that sort of diagrammed

287
00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:44,599
out. It's sort of a silly example because I wanted to just keep these super simple and

288
00:13:44,619 --> 00:13:46,160
get to the actual meaty stuff.

289
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:51,771
The diamond here sort of reads sideways,

290
00:13:52,471 --> 00:13:54,372
although you start at the top with,

291
00:13:54,452 --> 00:13:55,572
you have to choose correctly.

292
00:13:56,412 --> 00:13:58,413
And from there, you can either choose wrong or right.

293
00:13:59,073 --> 00:14:00,353
If you choose right, you're fantastic,

294
00:14:00,413 --> 00:14:02,174
and you miss out on going on your fabulous quest.

295
00:14:03,214 --> 00:14:05,955
If you wanted a shortcut in the game, great, you got it.

296
00:14:07,175 --> 00:14:09,656
On the other hand, maybe it's punishment

297
00:14:09,676 --> 00:14:10,596
for the player being wrong,

298
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,176
so suddenly you have to go on this quest,

299
00:14:12,997 --> 00:14:14,657
and you refuse to do it, so then you're in the dungeon.

300
00:14:15,695 --> 00:14:17,236
But then you're given a chance to redeem yourself.

301
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,558
So now it's sort of a redemption story.

302
00:14:19,618 --> 00:14:22,299
Like, you know, you've seen that you're a bad guy

303
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:24,261
in the eyes of the king, so you're gonna go on his quest.

304
00:14:25,801 --> 00:14:27,943
Or maybe you daringly escaped the dungeon,

305
00:14:28,003 --> 00:14:29,364
and so now you've decided that you're going to

306
00:14:29,384 --> 00:14:30,524
redeem yourself in the eyes of the people

307
00:14:30,564 --> 00:14:31,725
and go on that redemptive quest.

308
00:14:32,957 --> 00:14:35,798
So you might end up on the same quest three different ways,

309
00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:38,820
but in one sense it's you volunteered,

310
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,721
in another sense it's you've sort of been enslaved into it,

311
00:14:41,821 --> 00:14:44,462
and in a third sense you've decided to do it

312
00:14:44,542 --> 00:14:48,224
for your own sort of anti-heroic tendencies.

313
00:14:48,904 --> 00:14:52,666
So your point of view of your motivation for the quest

314
00:14:52,706 --> 00:14:53,406
changes a little bit.

315
00:14:54,281 --> 00:14:56,862
And you don't actually have to write any additional code

316
00:14:56,942 --> 00:14:58,823
or anything, you've just sort of thrown in a couple

317
00:14:58,843 --> 00:15:02,065
of extra writing options and ta-da, you're fantastic

318
00:15:02,085 --> 00:15:04,186
for whatever reason you thought you were fantastic.

319
00:15:09,349 --> 00:15:10,990
So this is the kind of stuff that I do with my students

320
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,211
that drives them crazy, we play games like Spot the Diamond

321
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:17,193
and it's not the two things that are diamond shaped

322
00:15:17,253 --> 00:15:17,653
as a hint.

323
00:15:17,673 --> 00:15:21,375
I'll just have you guys look at it for like 10 seconds.

324
00:15:24,984 --> 00:15:25,945
There's actually a couple of them.

325
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:33,674
So, this is a pretty simple story map,

326
00:15:33,754 --> 00:15:35,056
so there's not a lot going on,

327
00:15:35,096 --> 00:15:37,538
but you'll notice those aren't really diamond-shaped.

328
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:39,020
And this is actually one of the things

329
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,404
that the part of my research we're not gonna get to today

330
00:15:42,424 --> 00:15:44,046
is getting into, which is sort of.

331
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:51,156
auto-remapping to try to find these shapes in maps people draw. So, you know, when you

332
00:15:51,176 --> 00:15:54,979
draw your twine map and it's a mess, maybe you're just trying to get all your squares

333
00:15:55,019 --> 00:16:00,084
to line up nicely or not have too many crosses. And our concern is more, let's try to actually

334
00:16:00,104 --> 00:16:04,689
pull out these shapes that appear that might point to something going on in your story

335
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:06,731
that is desirable or not desirable.

336
00:16:08,025 --> 00:16:17,310
And those of you who have done graphics programming can probably appreciate it's a pain in the neck to try to actually get a bunch of objects to move and respect each other's space and so on.

337
00:16:18,091 --> 00:16:25,775
Our prototyping has been using OmniGraffle, which while a lovely tool, is not great when you get into like hundreds and hundreds of junctions on top of each other.

338
00:16:27,316 --> 00:16:28,877
Anyway, so here we have...

339
00:16:29,912 --> 00:16:31,352
these shapes that are not at all diamond-shaped.

340
00:16:31,372 --> 00:16:33,973
But there's actually two ways here,

341
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,835
where in one direction the player goes off to the side,

342
00:16:36,915 --> 00:16:39,016
and then down, and in the other the player goes

343
00:16:39,796 --> 00:16:41,317
over and down and then back up.

344
00:16:43,177 --> 00:16:44,878
But in this case it's not really up,

345
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:46,779
they just move the node down there.

346
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,420
So there's a lot of tricky stuff

347
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,500
to be done with directionality

348
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,321
as far as where are you trying to say

349
00:16:52,001 --> 00:16:53,422
the action actually is taking place.

350
00:16:53,702 --> 00:16:54,702
But if you follow the arrows,

351
00:16:55,023 --> 00:16:56,843
which again is part of what we're trying to automate.

352
00:16:57,762 --> 00:17:00,083
then you end up realizing, okay, well, pretty much

353
00:17:00,163 --> 00:17:02,905
all my choices are going to end up sticking me

354
00:17:03,085 --> 00:17:06,667
in this middle section here where something happens.

355
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:08,868
But there's also something else going on here

356
00:17:08,908 --> 00:17:12,570
that is not so good, and that is a loop.

357
00:17:14,271 --> 00:17:16,593
So loops are fantastic when you're trying to hit

358
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:18,034
every branch in a conversation tree,

359
00:17:18,334 --> 00:17:20,475
although they can make your NPCs sound like dimwits

360
00:17:20,795 --> 00:17:22,196
when you have the, you know,

361
00:17:23,577 --> 00:17:24,617
could you tell me that again?

362
00:17:27,322 --> 00:17:32,906
And they sometimes cause the player to realize that he or she is not making a difference in the world at all.

363
00:17:33,987 --> 00:17:40,111
So, once again, in the interest of simplicity, although there are many complex examples on my website,

364
00:17:41,272 --> 00:17:42,373
here's sort of the basic loop.

365
00:17:42,593 --> 00:17:43,494
You have to make a decision.

366
00:17:43,514 --> 00:17:45,035
Okay, I did it. Great.

367
00:17:45,796 --> 00:17:47,177
Okay, do you think we did the right thing?

368
00:17:47,617 --> 00:17:49,198
Hey, we have to make a big decision again.

369
00:17:49,218 --> 00:17:50,819
Okay, I did it. Great.

370
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,941
Oh, we're in a loop.

371
00:17:54,242 --> 00:17:56,483
So obviously there'd be a way out of this loop, but...

372
00:17:57,439 --> 00:18:02,382
It can be really frustrating if you're in something like this.

373
00:18:02,822 --> 00:18:05,623
This is a reduction project I'm currently working on.

374
00:18:07,765 --> 00:18:10,966
I would be super impressed if anyone can guess what I'm

375
00:18:10,986 --> 00:18:11,947
actually reducing here.

376
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,268
We can talk about it afterwards if you figure it out.

377
00:18:15,068 --> 00:18:20,351
But this is actually only act one of this particular story.

378
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:24,642
And I'm actually not even done with Act 1, I just had to, finally two nights ago, say

379
00:18:24,702 --> 00:18:26,905
this is going in as is, so my apologies.

380
00:18:26,985 --> 00:18:28,627
This is the cleanest version I have so far.

381
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:35,196
But as you can see, there are a lot of sort of potential loopy areas.

382
00:18:35,356 --> 00:18:37,719
I realize you can't see the arrows very well.

383
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,222
But you can certainly see there's a lot of areas

384
00:18:41,242 --> 00:18:43,623
where sort of things dovetail back into each other

385
00:18:43,724 --> 00:18:46,125
and you can get stuck in a corner really easily.

386
00:18:47,086 --> 00:18:49,608
So imagine you spend a bunch of time over there

387
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,449
on the left side as a player,

388
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,251
and you're wandering through all these nodes

389
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,372
and thinking I'm making progress,

390
00:18:54,412 --> 00:18:55,693
and then suddenly you're back to,

391
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:58,035
hey, you should investigate that same thing again.

392
00:18:59,516 --> 00:19:01,998
Really frustrating, and it kind of breaks the reality

393
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,960
of you're investigating this thing

394
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,341
and you have a competent team helping you.

395
00:19:08,978 --> 00:19:11,780
So once again, we'll do a little practice.

396
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,860
Can you spot the loop?

397
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:22,624
So again, I apologize.

398
00:19:22,644 --> 00:19:23,985
The arrows may be a little small.

399
00:19:24,185 --> 00:19:26,406
These slides will be up on my website as well as on the GDC

400
00:19:26,446 --> 00:19:29,487
site, so you can look at them later if you find this game at

401
00:19:29,527 --> 00:19:32,349
all entertaining, by which I mean the game of

402
00:19:32,389 --> 00:19:33,109
spotting these things.

403
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,691
But if you look at the arrows, you'll see that there's sort

404
00:19:36,711 --> 00:19:38,091
of a down over up.

405
00:19:38,982 --> 00:19:43,826
loop happening on the left and on the right. So basically we have to befriend that darn skunk.

406
00:19:44,546 --> 00:19:51,952
Which stinks. Sorry. I know. I know. I was reworking these slides at two in the morning.

407
00:19:52,152 --> 00:19:57,516
Give me a break. Okay. So you probably know if you're making these if you've been writing

408
00:19:57,536 --> 00:19:59,778
interactive narratives for a while, but

409
00:20:00,643 --> 00:20:04,685
One caution I have for people is that once you start actually mapping your work out,

410
00:20:04,785 --> 00:20:06,786
instead of sort of having that mental separation of,

411
00:20:07,286 --> 00:20:08,926
oh, well, I'm the writer and I'm writing my stuff,

412
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:11,608
and I'll just give that to the other guy who will do the interactions or whatever,

413
00:20:13,068 --> 00:20:14,629
then there becomes this temptation of,

414
00:20:15,129 --> 00:20:17,830
oh, I'm a really creative person and this thing connects to this thing,

415
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:18,971
and I can totally make this work,

416
00:20:19,031 --> 00:20:22,152
and then suddenly you've made a whole bunch of loops you didn't mean to make.

417
00:20:23,273 --> 00:20:25,534
which is in fact what happened here with this student project.

418
00:20:26,174 --> 00:20:27,595
One member of a five-person group

419
00:20:28,035 --> 00:20:30,916
came up with some brilliant ideas at the 11th hour

420
00:20:30,936 --> 00:20:32,717
and put them in without anyone else knowing.

421
00:20:33,737 --> 00:20:35,738
Yeah, it was a kind of ugly beta test.

422
00:20:35,758 --> 00:20:40,901
OK, in the interest of time, skipping ahead here.

423
00:20:41,661 --> 00:20:42,721
So the zipper.

424
00:20:43,782 --> 00:20:46,164
which is one that we named ourselves, as far as I know,

425
00:20:47,586 --> 00:20:48,507
which I think is kind of cute.

426
00:20:49,127 --> 00:20:52,390
Basically, lets players make minor non-story breaking

427
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,352
choices until you're ready to deal with major ones.

428
00:20:56,994 --> 00:20:58,956
Talk yesterday actually did a really good job of dividing

429
00:20:58,996 --> 00:21:01,438
things up into sort of choices and major branches.

430
00:21:01,518 --> 00:21:04,501
So this is sort of the choice area, and then at the bottom

431
00:21:04,581 --> 00:21:06,122
you have your major branch.

432
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:09,405
So it's basically an extended remix of the diamonds that we

433
00:21:09,445 --> 00:21:10,166
looked at at the beginning.

434
00:21:11,622 --> 00:21:12,742
The difference is that with this,

435
00:21:12,842 --> 00:21:15,063
you're at some point planning to have a major branch

436
00:21:15,784 --> 00:21:18,025
that actually is important, like an avoidable death,

437
00:21:18,505 --> 00:21:20,526
or an optional romance, or something else

438
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:21,666
where you actually wanna sort of have,

439
00:21:24,888 --> 00:21:25,908
where you sort of wanna have people

440
00:21:26,849 --> 00:21:28,569
having a real effect on the story.

441
00:21:31,031 --> 00:21:32,511
So, with the diamond, you can extend,

442
00:21:32,531 --> 00:21:34,572
or sorry, the zipper, you can extend the diamonds

443
00:21:34,612 --> 00:21:37,333
as much as you want, and then branch

444
00:21:37,694 --> 00:21:38,954
only when you absolutely need to,

445
00:21:39,154 --> 00:21:40,255
or when it's time to do it.

446
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:44,518
One example that people may not have seen of this

447
00:21:44,578 --> 00:21:48,381
is Long Story, which is a really cute game that I only

448
00:21:48,421 --> 00:21:50,743
found recently, which surprises me, given my job.

449
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:56,488
But it does a really nice job of balancing the there's

450
00:21:56,528 --> 00:21:58,969
a little light mystery going on, but at the same time,

451
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,471
you actually can have a relationship

452
00:22:01,511 --> 00:22:02,953
with most of the major characters.

453
00:22:03,353 --> 00:22:04,254
You pick your gender.

454
00:22:04,494 --> 00:22:05,735
You have three gender choices.

455
00:22:06,655 --> 00:22:06,795
And.

456
00:22:07,901 --> 00:22:13,363
the game is very nice about accommodating any of those decisions in different ways.

457
00:22:13,423 --> 00:22:18,365
So you don't just feel like it's, you know, hello, Marcel, you actually have some kind

458
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:22,006
of like sense that the story is actually going where you want it to.

459
00:22:22,626 --> 00:22:26,488
That being said, there are a lot of places where the story ends up sort of branching

460
00:22:26,528 --> 00:22:31,790
back and you're saying, well, why am I back in this weird mystery that I decided I didn't

461
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,090
care about because I'm more interested in my boyfriend right now.

462
00:22:35,231 --> 00:22:35,451
But.

463
00:22:36,909 --> 00:22:40,150
I mean, that's the backbone of the story, so you have to get back there eventually.

464
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:45,591
But what's really nice about Long Story is actually it's ironically very short episodes.

465
00:22:46,372 --> 00:22:50,573
So I think with the time between episodes, the Long Story folks are really able to sort

466
00:22:50,593 --> 00:22:56,454
of focus on, let's make sure every relationship option is meaningful and different and cool,

467
00:22:57,414 --> 00:23:01,415
and then we'll have the sort of mystery story that just plays out as it does.

468
00:23:01,495 --> 00:23:03,036
So it's an interesting shift in priorities.

469
00:23:03,889 --> 00:23:05,931
that works really well with the sort of zipper structure

470
00:23:06,331 --> 00:23:08,112
because they can jump off when they need to

471
00:23:08,152 --> 00:23:09,533
into these other parts.

472
00:23:11,134 --> 00:23:12,656
So I promised narrative mapping frameworks,

473
00:23:12,796 --> 00:23:16,318
so this will be the narrative mapping frameworks bit

474
00:23:16,819 --> 00:23:17,960
in my last five minutes here.

475
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:20,461
But that's probably for the best

476
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:23,624
because this part gets into the really dense stuff

477
00:23:23,724 --> 00:23:25,265
that I have a lot about online.

478
00:23:26,286 --> 00:23:29,188
So I created map templates to try to get my students to

479
00:23:30,297 --> 00:23:34,119
not basically recreate Zork or insert last game they played.

480
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,081
With the idea being that these are just starting points.

481
00:23:38,161 --> 00:23:40,742
The idea is that they fill in the blanks,

482
00:23:41,103 --> 00:23:44,684
or the lettered blanks, with story idea,

483
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:47,866
and they try to make a story that navigates.

484
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:49,467
You know, it's kind of like when you're in grade school

485
00:23:49,487 --> 00:23:50,988
and you get the five paragraph essay,

486
00:23:51,148 --> 00:23:52,528
and you're told, you know,

487
00:23:52,888 --> 00:23:54,990
paragraph one is your topic statement,

488
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:56,991
paragraph five is your conclusion.

489
00:23:57,831 --> 00:23:58,411
Same idea here.

490
00:23:59,988 --> 00:24:02,249
The main idea, though, is to get students to not think

491
00:24:02,269 --> 00:24:03,590
about programming constraints, and that's

492
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,671
why I wanted to present this to you guys as well.

493
00:24:07,692 --> 00:24:09,894
The idea being to really make things visible.

494
00:24:10,974 --> 00:24:13,156
It's really easy, especially with projects like the two

495
00:24:13,196 --> 00:24:15,997
that I showed with my superstar students who created

496
00:24:16,057 --> 00:24:17,138
cool stuff in the first week.

497
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,660
It's really easy to have the coding members of the team

498
00:24:21,441 --> 00:24:25,403
get buried in this stuff so the writers don't really

499
00:24:26,735 --> 00:24:31,681
necessarily fully appreciate what's going on anymore or maybe appreciate it but sort

500
00:24:31,701 --> 00:24:36,147
of don't quite understand, okay, do I assign seven points to that? Do I assign five points

501
00:24:36,187 --> 00:24:40,633
to that? Do I have to assign points? What's going on here? So with the mapping structures,

502
00:24:40,853 --> 00:24:44,258
the idea is that we have sort of a more open way of visually communicating.

503
00:24:45,362 --> 00:24:46,102
what you're trying to do.

504
00:24:47,082 --> 00:24:49,223
And on the writing side, the goal

505
00:24:49,283 --> 00:24:52,164
is to better communicate options and outcomes to your players

506
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:52,625
as well.

507
00:24:52,985 --> 00:24:54,265
They won't actually see your map, of course.

508
00:24:54,805 --> 00:24:56,786
But if you can say, oh, well, over here,

509
00:24:56,846 --> 00:24:58,067
this is going to have a major effect,

510
00:24:58,127 --> 00:25:01,568
then you might be able to actually write something

511
00:25:01,608 --> 00:25:02,489
to hint at that.

512
00:25:04,089 --> 00:25:05,730
So the one template I'm going to get to

513
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,391
is this lock and key template, which needs a new name.

514
00:25:08,451 --> 00:25:10,712
So if you have any ideas, let me know, because it implies puzzle.

515
00:25:11,352 --> 00:25:13,013
And it's not supposed to be just puzzles.

516
00:25:13,877 --> 00:25:17,099
It's based just on the idea that the player needs to do X before Y can happen.

517
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:20,441
It's basically Boolean logic for people who have trouble visualizing flowcharts.

518
00:25:21,702 --> 00:25:22,703
And it's a pretty simple idea.

519
00:25:23,263 --> 00:25:28,426
The idea is you have these numbered nodes, and any set that have the same number, or one unit,

520
00:25:30,536 --> 00:25:34,039
with L and U being locked and unlocked, and K being the key.

521
00:25:34,139 --> 00:25:37,241
So up at the top in the zoomed-in version, we have 2K,

522
00:25:37,681 --> 00:25:40,644
and we have 2L that can get us to 2K, which then lets us

523
00:25:40,704 --> 00:25:41,424
unlock 2U.

524
00:25:42,105 --> 00:25:43,626
And in this case, I put them all near each other

525
00:25:43,686 --> 00:25:45,748
for space saving, but you can have them farther apart.

526
00:25:46,368 --> 00:25:47,529
But the idea is that you actually

527
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:49,450
have a way of saying, no, these two things are actually

528
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:52,333
the same, they're just spatially apart.

529
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:54,913
which might seem a little weird,

530
00:25:55,033 --> 00:25:57,014
but this worked really well with one student group,

531
00:25:57,114 --> 00:25:59,275
the group that actually did the really nice looking video.

532
00:26:00,416 --> 00:26:01,757
They decided to use Twine initially,

533
00:26:01,937 --> 00:26:06,299
and they actually entered the template into Twine,

534
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,661
and then typed in their story idea.

535
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:11,182
And only after that did they say,

536
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:13,283
okay, now let's actually start breaking this thing up

537
00:26:13,343 --> 00:26:15,264
and figuring out what do we really wanna tell,

538
00:26:15,304 --> 00:26:16,705
let's throw out this template idea,

539
00:26:16,725 --> 00:26:18,966
and actually make it into something.

540
00:26:20,469 --> 00:26:25,692
What's funny is all their scribbles on the left actually ended up turning into something on the right

541
00:26:25,872 --> 00:26:28,353
that looked very much like the map I'd originally given them.

542
00:26:28,893 --> 00:26:31,914
But that's actually the physical layout of the insane asylum.

543
00:26:32,835 --> 00:26:34,976
The story's about a journalist investigating an insane asylum.

544
00:26:36,014 --> 00:26:38,976
because we still can't quite get away from the broken people,

545
00:26:39,036 --> 00:26:41,538
crazy theme of interactive fiction.

546
00:26:41,798 --> 00:26:43,799
But I think it's actually kind of a cool thing,

547
00:26:43,879 --> 00:26:44,800
so we'll go with it.

548
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,721
Anyway, but what was really cool here

549
00:26:46,881 --> 00:26:48,802
is that whether accidentally or on purpose,

550
00:26:49,343 --> 00:26:50,724
they actually ended up sort of creating

551
00:26:50,764 --> 00:26:54,106
this physical landscape that mapped the mental breakdown

552
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:56,227
of the woman, sort of the, if she goes one direction,

553
00:26:56,287 --> 00:26:59,149
it's more into she's going to be imprisoned forever.

554
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:00,730
And if she goes the other direction,

555
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,591
then she might get out.

556
00:27:02,673 --> 00:27:04,574
But since there's this whole question of is she crazy

557
00:27:04,654 --> 00:27:06,374
or is she not throughout the story,

558
00:27:06,914 --> 00:27:09,055
it was a really nice thematic overlay

559
00:27:11,435 --> 00:27:14,456
with puzzles and stuff, but it basically showed me

560
00:27:14,476 --> 00:27:16,176
they'd sort of learned something from their play through

561
00:27:16,236 --> 00:27:19,477
of Gone Home as far as like how to physically tell a story,

562
00:27:20,237 --> 00:27:21,717
but in a much more subtle way,

563
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:23,177
even though what they were really doing here

564
00:27:23,197 --> 00:27:24,818
was sort of puzzle making.

565
00:27:27,378 --> 00:27:29,539
So sadly, we do not have time to play the game

566
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:31,779
because I'm told I have one minute, but it is online.

567
00:27:33,323 --> 00:27:34,384
There's plenty more to see, however.

568
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,485
See, I knew this would happen.

569
00:27:37,306 --> 00:27:38,848
This is the stuff that we're currently working on.

570
00:27:39,328 --> 00:27:43,252
This is not a big walking ad for my lab, which is the narrative

571
00:27:43,292 --> 00:27:44,053
lab at Northeastern.

572
00:27:44,653 --> 00:27:47,396
But I do hope you guys will come visit stuff

573
00:27:47,476 --> 00:27:48,336
as we start to put it up.

574
00:27:52,387 --> 00:27:54,068
Since mapping is kind of a reductive process,

575
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:56,649
I figured I should end by sort of doing the reductive thing

576
00:27:56,669 --> 00:27:59,291
on my own talk, so that's the whole talk

577
00:27:59,391 --> 00:28:01,212
in sort of three things.

578
00:28:01,732 --> 00:28:03,633
The first two being things I hope everyone's doing.

579
00:28:04,133 --> 00:28:06,515
The last one being my advice of,

580
00:28:07,475 --> 00:28:09,136
if you wanted to tell an entirely cinematic story,

581
00:28:09,196 --> 00:28:11,417
well, it's actually gotten cheaper now to make a movie

582
00:28:11,457 --> 00:28:14,359
than to necessarily make a good game, so make a movie.

583
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,701
Speculation about the future.

584
00:28:21,402 --> 00:28:24,885
So we're still in the discovery phase on games like this,

585
00:28:25,266 --> 00:28:26,727
games like Gone Home, Her Story,

586
00:28:27,508 --> 00:28:29,350
currently all still are getting comments like,

587
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,852
I've never played anything like this before.

588
00:28:31,633 --> 00:28:32,674
Each is a unique experience

589
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,055
because the story is so personal.

590
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,218
But when you reduce these games to the most basic mechanics,

591
00:28:37,459 --> 00:28:39,421
hiding everything in plain sight through good level design,

592
00:28:40,202 --> 00:28:41,703
they point towards a future in which everyone

593
00:28:41,723 --> 00:28:43,085
will have seen something like these games.

594
00:28:44,008 --> 00:28:46,949
And that excites me, because if everybody

595
00:28:47,349 --> 00:28:49,090
has seen games like this, then maybe people

596
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,490
will invent more games like this,

597
00:28:50,651 --> 00:28:53,172
and this will become just a general medium

598
00:28:53,252 --> 00:28:54,272
for critical comment.

599
00:28:55,112 --> 00:28:57,433
Maybe your game will be our generation's Ulysses,

600
00:28:58,094 --> 00:28:59,274
although hopefully that means your game's

601
00:28:59,294 --> 00:29:00,435
an interesting and challenging work,

602
00:29:00,535 --> 00:29:02,095
and not that everyone says they'll read it,

603
00:29:02,255 --> 00:29:03,316
even though they're not going to.

604
00:29:05,897 --> 00:29:07,117
So finally, because I know I'm over time,

605
00:29:07,657 --> 00:29:09,178
good stories leave the player wanting more,

606
00:29:10,659 --> 00:29:11,879
because they relish the experience,

607
00:29:11,899 --> 00:29:13,040
not because it felt incomplete.

608
00:29:14,684 --> 00:29:16,365
unless the ending was supposed to make them feel that way,

609
00:29:17,787 --> 00:29:19,808
like this talk, which is perpetually to be continued.

610
00:29:21,891 --> 00:29:24,053
So this is my obligatory thank you,

611
00:29:24,113 --> 00:29:26,475
because the Lowell Institute actually paid for me to be here.

612
00:29:27,736 --> 00:29:30,679
And here is my contact info, so I hope you will be in touch.

613
00:29:30,879 --> 00:29:32,861
And thank you for staying over by one minute.

614
00:29:33,101 --> 00:29:33,822
Class dismissed.
