00:00:06,572 --> 00:00:12,082
Hello, everyone. My name is Ifrat Shaik and I want to talk a little bit about what can

2
00:00:12,123 --> 00:00:14,607
game designers learn from competitive reality show.

3
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,123
Before I start, I want to acknowledge the land in which I'm speaking to you

4
00:00:22,283 --> 00:00:24,825
is from the traditional territory of many nations,

5
00:00:24,905 --> 00:00:27,847
including the Mississauga of the Credit, the Anishinaabe,

6
00:00:27,907 --> 00:00:31,209
the Chippewa, the Aztec, and the Wendat people,

7
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:35,191
and is now home to many diverse First Nations, Inuit, and MÃ©tis people.

8
00:00:35,612 --> 00:00:39,174
I would also like to acknowledge that Toronto, also known as Toronto,

9
00:00:39,494 --> 00:00:42,656
is covered by Treaty 13 with the Mississauga of the Credit.

10
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:47,705
So who am I?

11
00:00:48,225 --> 00:00:49,206
My name is Ifat Cheikh.

12
00:00:49,226 --> 00:00:51,388
As I mentioned, I'm an assistant professor

13
00:00:51,828 --> 00:00:53,389
at York University in Canada.

14
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,573
I'm also an experimental game designer.

15
00:00:58,093 --> 00:00:59,494
I'm currently working on games that

16
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,916
are made in non-traditional game engine.

17
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:06,520
The current one uses Miro, and I made games in Excel as well,

18
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,403
and bots that examine issues around AI ethic.

19
00:01:11,425 --> 00:01:13,566
I am not going to talk about any of those here,

20
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:17,848
but rather I'm going to draw of my love of the trashier side

21
00:01:17,868 --> 00:01:21,290
of TV, which frankly I do not consider to be trash at all,

22
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,091
and examine the game design of specific reality show,

23
00:01:24,531 --> 00:01:26,752
as I believe that there is a lot we can learn from them.

24
00:01:27,732 --> 00:01:30,233
This to say, not this talk came to be

25
00:01:30,273 --> 00:01:31,894
because I really like Survivor, and I'm

26
00:01:31,934 --> 00:01:33,555
trying to convince more people to watch it.

27
00:01:34,655 --> 00:01:38,637
I should note, I tried to make this talk intro

28
00:01:39,782 --> 00:01:44,263
into a more practical look at this show with the idea that by the end of this talk you will come

29
00:01:44,343 --> 00:01:51,125
up with some idea of how you can use those games to implement in your own design.

30
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:57,227
But I only have about half an hour so I will probably only whet your appetite and interest

31
00:01:57,307 --> 00:02:02,149
on the topic or just make you think that it's not worth your time. I'm also an academic so

32
00:02:02,169 --> 00:02:05,350
sometimes I can have myself an overcomplicated thing.

33
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:12,696
So, on August 23rd, 2000, more than 50 million Americans watched the final of the first season

34
00:02:12,736 --> 00:02:18,763
of Survivor, making it a cultural milestone and birthing the age of reality shows. It seems silly

35
00:02:18,803 --> 00:02:22,688
nowadays, but looking back at the popularity of the first few seasons of Survivor,

36
00:02:23,609 --> 00:02:29,933
and later Big Brother, made the participant of this show a youth celebrity,

37
00:02:29,953 --> 00:02:33,755
if only for a very short while, and managed for at least a few years

38
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:38,117
to dominate the TV landscape until eventually being replaced by Prestige TV.

39
00:02:38,918 --> 00:02:43,802
It is important to note, Survivor was certainly not the first very popular reality show out there.

40
00:02:44,903 --> 00:02:51,448
I want to give credit to the real world, but, and can also be argued that game show also can fit

41
00:02:51,528 --> 00:02:57,352
into the term reality show, and I think some of them, I can think of something like the Crystal

42
00:02:57,913 --> 00:03:05,118
Maze is well worth exploring. So, this to say, reality shows are still being produced.

43
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,282
For one thing, they're cheaper to produce.

44
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:14,567
While Survivor, at this point, has a huge amount of people working for it,

45
00:03:15,368 --> 00:03:19,111
it's still cheaper than working on a more prestige TV drama.

46
00:03:20,392 --> 00:03:25,476
And a lot of them also share production with other countries, so

47
00:03:26,137 --> 00:03:32,803
the cost of running a reality show is still enormously less than other type of show.

48
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:34,840
They're still very popular.

49
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,522
While they do not reach the height of popularity and buzz

50
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:39,103
that they had in the early 2000s,

51
00:03:39,123 --> 00:03:43,085
they're still very successful and a huge part

52
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,306
of the media landscape.

53
00:03:44,366 --> 00:03:46,407
And they're still getting a really high rating.

54
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,830
I think Survivor is still one of the highest rated shows

55
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:50,690
on Wednesdays.

56
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:53,752
They proved that they're here to stay.

57
00:03:53,832 --> 00:03:55,553
Survivor has 40 seasons.

58
00:03:56,234 --> 00:03:57,875
Big Brother, the American version, has 22.

59
00:03:57,955 --> 00:04:01,297
The Circle is a huge hit for Netflix.

60
00:04:02,101 --> 00:04:06,063
And then shows like RuPaul's Drag Race, The Great British Air Cuff, etc.

61
00:04:06,943 --> 00:04:08,944
We did not talk about the cultural impact.

62
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:13,125
For both good and very bad, reality shows have affected our culture.

63
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:17,707
By all accounts, the image of the former president of the United States,

64
00:04:19,287 --> 00:04:21,868
which helped him get elected, was heavily influenced

65
00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:25,070
by the image constructed by a reality show.

66
00:04:28,158 --> 00:04:30,919
Lastly, there's a lot they can teach us.

67
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:34,620
Their design can teach us how to improve our own design.

68
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,580
There's a lot of things we can analyze and critique about the shows,

69
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,481
from issues of race, colonialism and gender, to the evolution of strategic gameplay.

70
00:04:43,982 --> 00:04:48,262
For the sake of this talk, I'm going to focus on how competitive reality shows,

71
00:04:48,743 --> 00:04:51,743
which I will describe in the next section, create emerging gameplay,

72
00:04:52,143 --> 00:04:55,664
and how player agency affects the overall thematic game.

73
00:04:56,737 --> 00:05:00,962
I'm going to look at the way the players interact with the system of rules set by the designer of the game,

74
00:05:01,383 --> 00:05:04,306
now they use those to create their own rule and game dynamic.

75
00:05:05,267 --> 00:05:09,191
While those rules of the show do not change that much, the way the player use them and

76
00:05:09,211 --> 00:05:13,496
interact with each other is ever-changing, creating surprising new interaction in narratives.

77
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,981
So let's talk about our competitive...

78
00:05:18,715 --> 00:05:25,499
reality shows first. What do I mean? So there's many genres of reality shows, and their popularity

79
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:31,183
tends to change over time. From documentaries like shows where there's very little production

80
00:05:31,203 --> 00:05:36,246
interference like The Real World, skill-based competition like Who Paul Drag Race, The Great

81
00:05:36,346 --> 00:05:42,110
British Bake Off, American Idol, etc., which are probably the most popular nowadays,

82
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:46,453
soap opera style like Docusoft and celebrity reality.

83
00:05:47,193 --> 00:05:49,215
like the Kardashian and the Real Housewife,

84
00:05:50,297 --> 00:05:52,939
which mimic sort of the liberty tries to mimic

85
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,861
the appearance and structure of a soap opera.

86
00:05:56,063 --> 00:05:57,604
Home Improvement Show, which there's

87
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,987
a full channel just for those kinds of show.

88
00:06:00,007 --> 00:06:01,569
Dating show like The Bachelor,

89
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:04,171
Too Hot to Handle, Marriage on First Sight, etc.

90
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:09,097
And there's many other genre in it.

91
00:06:10,062 --> 00:06:12,826
I would like to focus on one specific type of reality show,

92
00:06:13,267 --> 00:06:18,133
which I call competitive reality show, which might be a sub-genre.

93
00:06:18,153 --> 00:06:21,257
It's a bit hard to quantify, but those are competitive shows

94
00:06:21,778 --> 00:06:25,303
in which ordinary people compete to win a prize, usually a cash one.

95
00:06:26,732 --> 00:06:32,499
And they have a strong game like elements to them with specific game mechanic, the idea of

96
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:39,809
entering the magic circle, strategy, procedurally generated contact and etc.

97
00:06:42,211 --> 00:06:48,654
So what are the specific elements of the show? How do we differentiate them from other types of reality genre?

98
00:06:49,174 --> 00:06:53,496
So the first one is the prize. The show will generally involve a large cash prize.

99
00:06:54,317 --> 00:06:59,119
This will not include job offer, collection, etc. but strictly money.

100
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:05,441
Survivor probably has the largest prize which was a million dollars and I think since 40 was 2 million.

101
00:07:07,984 --> 00:07:13,527
because the amount of hardship they have to deal with and they're offered affect the amount they

102
00:07:13,547 --> 00:07:21,673
get. And I think like the circle is much less. I think it's like 100k. The second element is

103
00:07:21,793 --> 00:07:27,197
ordinary people. The contestants do not have specific skill and are often chosen for personality

104
00:07:27,257 --> 00:07:28,618
and archetype they embody.

105
00:07:29,527 --> 00:07:33,929
And the last thing, which is probably the biggest thing, is immunity,

106
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:37,452
in which contestants can win the right to be exempt the next time

107
00:07:37,472 --> 00:07:41,074
a contestant might be eliminated from the show.

108
00:07:42,075 --> 00:07:44,676
This allows for strategic gameplay as the players

109
00:07:45,237 --> 00:07:48,499
are not only trying to not lose but also to get immunity.

110
00:07:49,546 --> 00:07:54,050
In my opinion, as I said, this is the element which allows the game to become a complex strategic game

111
00:07:54,910 --> 00:08:00,895
as players are not only trying to win or to lose, but also trying to be safe

112
00:08:01,255 --> 00:08:04,638
and or trying to prevent other players from being safe.

113
00:08:07,504 --> 00:08:14,329
I'm gonna there's a few shows that fit the bill survivor obviously as I mentioned the amazing race big brother the American version

114
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:17,591
Canadian version not the more international version

115
00:08:17,611 --> 00:08:19,011
the circle

116
00:08:21,107 --> 00:08:23,929
But for the sake of time and keeping the top focus,

117
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:26,810
I will only focus on two shows, Survivor and The Circle.

118
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,852
For one thing, I'm the most familiar with them.

119
00:08:30,952 --> 00:08:33,854
And while there's a lot to say about Big Brother specifically,

120
00:08:35,154 --> 00:08:37,075
but the two different versions of the show

121
00:08:37,275 --> 00:08:38,876
and my lack of familiarity with it.

122
00:08:40,337 --> 00:08:45,118
American Canadian version, I felt I'm not an expert enough on those shows to talk about them.

123
00:08:46,078 --> 00:08:51,980
I also think there's something fitting in talking about the oldest and the newest show of the genre.

124
00:08:53,181 --> 00:08:59,743
So, level of engagement. You can look at those shows and games with four distinct

125
00:08:59,803 --> 00:09:05,624
level of engagement. The producer, the player, the editor, and the viewer, with each level

126
00:09:05,684 --> 00:09:08,485
separately contributing and helping with the success of the show.

127
00:09:10,241 --> 00:09:15,182
The producer, who act as both the game dungeon master and the game designer,

128
00:09:15,242 --> 00:09:19,383
they are there to design the rule of the game and make sure they are followed,

129
00:09:19,503 --> 00:09:22,584
as well as making sure the production of the show is running smoothly.

130
00:09:23,264 --> 00:09:27,325
I call this category producer, but it includes almost everyone involved

131
00:09:27,425 --> 00:09:30,726
in the overall production of the show, the behind the scene.

132
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:35,748
That includes survivor, vast medical staff, and the poor person whose job

133
00:09:35,788 --> 00:09:38,588
is to describe what the players in the circle say.

134
00:09:39,575 --> 00:09:44,718
While they are mostly silent, the host acts as their face and reinforcers,

135
00:09:45,558 --> 00:09:48,499
sort of we can look at them as the main dungeon masters,

136
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:52,401
and their job is to guide the player and make sure that the game is run smoothly

137
00:09:52,481 --> 00:09:57,383
and maintain the illusion of reality in a make-believe situation.

138
00:09:58,403 --> 00:10:02,245
In some cases, like Jeff Probst from Survivor, the host is also the executive

139
00:10:02,285 --> 00:10:05,046
producer and his control is much bigger than other hosts,

140
00:10:05,526 --> 00:10:08,287
and it can even change or modify rules on the fly.

141
00:10:09,813 --> 00:10:13,195
The amount of control the producers have is different from show to show

142
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:17,598
and reports of producer interference is always part of the conversation

143
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:18,419
around those shows.

144
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:24,804
Survivor especially was accused many times of having the production interference

145
00:10:24,844 --> 00:10:26,064
change the outcome of the vote.

146
00:10:26,104 --> 00:10:28,266
This has never been proven.

147
00:10:28,526 --> 00:10:31,628
Big Brother has also been accused and frankly,

148
00:10:31,849 --> 00:10:35,171
the producer interference is a lot more visible there.

149
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:39,094
There are actually quite a lot of fan theories around producer interference.

150
00:10:39,966 --> 00:10:40,927
which I won't get into.

151
00:10:41,847 --> 00:10:43,769
The second level of engagement is the players.

152
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:46,690
The players are the people chosen to play the game.

153
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:51,754
They are the ones who produce the majority of the emerging gameplay content

154
00:10:51,814 --> 00:10:54,095
of the show as they are the folks who are interacting

155
00:10:54,135 --> 00:10:55,756
with the rules set by the producers.

156
00:10:56,417 --> 00:10:58,818
Some of those interactions are amazing and wonderful.

157
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:03,201
There is wonderful humane moments, there are wonderful strategic elements.

158
00:11:04,021 --> 00:11:06,563
And some of them are extremely unpleasant,

159
00:11:06,683 --> 00:11:09,165
like the contents of being outed as a trans man.

160
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:14,333
I don't have time to specifically talk about the casting process,

161
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:19,596
but with a lot of them, players are chosen to fulfill a specific archetype

162
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:23,840
and are often presented that way.

163
00:11:26,161 --> 00:11:30,805
In a recent TikTok, Kelly Wentworth, a Survivor contestant,

164
00:11:30,845 --> 00:11:35,808
mentioned how her archetype was the farmer's daughter,

165
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,610
and so she was only allowed...

166
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:41,068
to bring in clothes that fit that archetype.

167
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,349
The next one are the editors.

168
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:46,870
The players are often filmed 24-7.

169
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,791
And the editor's job is to distill this narrative

170
00:11:49,851 --> 00:11:52,592
into a chunk of about 45 minutes,

171
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:54,732
depending on the show, which tells the viewer everything

172
00:11:54,752 --> 00:11:56,513
that happened in the span of a few days

173
00:11:56,933 --> 00:12:00,615
and craft a coherent narrative from the footage they have.

174
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:04,732
The editor have full control to pick and choose how to tell the narrative,

175
00:12:04,772 --> 00:12:08,614
but the narrative is also completely dependent on the player action themselves.

176
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,096
If the players have nothing to show,

177
00:12:11,236 --> 00:12:16,119
even the most interesting editing won't help with crafting an interesting story.

178
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:18,659
And the last ones are the viewers.

179
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:21,800
The last level of engagement is the audience itself,

180
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,660
which engage with the show as linear entertainment,

181
00:12:25,521 --> 00:12:28,781
sort of as a spectator in a sport event,

182
00:12:29,321 --> 00:12:31,842
and have no power to control the narrative of the show,

183
00:12:31,942 --> 00:12:36,642
but can engage in participatory action when the need arise.

184
00:12:37,443 --> 00:12:42,603
Example, anything like voicing their opinion on social media,

185
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:46,024
as well as creating games based on their show.

186
00:12:46,604 --> 00:12:48,806
which I will talk about in a later session.

187
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:54,611
So how does this mechanic of the game encourage player agency

188
00:12:54,671 --> 00:12:56,393
and create emerging narrative?

189
00:12:56,673 --> 00:12:59,075
How does the intention of the designer and the player

190
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,138
interaction with the game affect the gameplay?

191
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,120
And

192
00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:07,726
So before I give specific example,

193
00:13:07,806 --> 00:13:09,486
I'll talk a little bit about what it means

194
00:13:09,506 --> 00:13:10,687
when I talk about emergent.

195
00:13:11,607 --> 00:13:13,527
This is sort of my definition mixed

196
00:13:13,547 --> 00:13:14,908
with a lot of other definitions.

197
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,328
And some of you might say, oh, this is wrong.

198
00:13:17,628 --> 00:13:18,228
That's OK.

199
00:13:18,969 --> 00:13:22,409
But this is just sort of to put us in the same place.

200
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,090
In the simplest term, emergent is

201
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,831
when the game allows the player to craft their own experience

202
00:13:27,871 --> 00:13:28,291
in the game.

203
00:13:28,711 --> 00:13:31,132
It is the unexpected outcome of player interaction

204
00:13:31,152 --> 00:13:33,092
with the system of rules set by the designer.

205
00:13:34,192 --> 00:13:39,933
Emergent is sort of a buzzword nowadays as game companies are looking more and more into procedural techniques

206
00:13:40,394 --> 00:13:41,914
which will allow them to prolong

207
00:13:42,674 --> 00:13:44,314
player engagement with their product.

208
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:51,936
The problem with that is that unlike crafted story, emergent stories and systems are not something we necessarily know how to design

209
00:13:52,356 --> 00:13:56,477
and even how to approach it in a way that creates an engaging play experience.

210
00:13:57,395 --> 00:14:01,340
So the single most important act of emergence in Survivor

211
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,602
happened in the first season.

212
00:14:03,262 --> 00:14:06,807
And it defined not just the show, but the genre itself.

213
00:14:07,928 --> 00:14:10,391
Initially, Survivor was billed as the greatest social

214
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,014
experiment on the planet, a show in which

215
00:14:13,034 --> 00:14:15,917
a group of ordinary American are left stranded on an island

216
00:14:15,937 --> 00:14:17,780
that has to build a new society.

217
00:14:20,451 --> 00:14:24,952
Most players took it to heart and while they voted a player every week, those players were

218
00:14:24,972 --> 00:14:28,613
generally the people who could not handle the physical and social aspect of the game.

219
00:14:29,893 --> 00:14:34,794
It was Richard Hatch, the eventual winner, who understood something that not even the producer

220
00:14:34,894 --> 00:14:40,395
did. Survivor is not a social experiment about who can survive in the wilderness, rather it is a

221
00:14:40,435 --> 00:14:45,636
complex strategic game and in order to win you need to deploy game theory strategy like the

222
00:14:45,836 --> 00:14:48,077
prisoner's dilemma and the Nash equilibrium.

223
00:14:50,187 --> 00:14:52,649
On day 10, he formed a plan which led to his victory.

224
00:14:52,669 --> 00:14:57,132
He formed a voting bloc or an alliance with three other members of his tribe.

225
00:14:57,513 --> 00:15:00,675
For the rest of the season, the four-person alliance dominated the game,

226
00:15:00,755 --> 00:15:03,477
voting out everyone else until there were only four left.

227
00:15:04,017 --> 00:15:07,660
At this point, the alliance was shattered and the game became an individual game.

228
00:15:08,777 --> 00:15:11,177
And while this character constantly evolves since then,

229
00:15:11,717 --> 00:15:14,978
the concept of alliance become a pivotal part of Survivor

230
00:15:15,098 --> 00:15:16,899
and other competitive show like Big Brother

231
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:17,899
and The Amazing Race.

232
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:22,120
So there are other reasons that season was a resounding success.

233
00:15:24,021 --> 00:15:26,101
It was Richard's hatch strategy that

234
00:15:26,161 --> 00:15:28,902
cemented Survivor's success in its culture influence.

235
00:15:29,522 --> 00:15:29,862
It's also.

236
00:15:29,939 --> 00:15:32,260
from its core gameplay loop, creating an alliance

237
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,561
and understanding which path you need to follow in order

238
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:35,341
to win the game.

239
00:15:36,321 --> 00:15:39,282
And it was probably the main factor in survival longevity

240
00:15:39,322 --> 00:15:40,803
as it made the game interesting.

241
00:15:42,304 --> 00:15:48,086
Another sort of emergent thing that actually caused

242
00:15:48,106 --> 00:15:52,827
a new mechanic to be introduced was in, I believe,

243
00:15:52,847 --> 00:15:54,988
season 9, which was Palau.

244
00:15:56,448 --> 00:16:00,949
And in this case, one of the tribes, the Ulaan tribe, just couldn't win.

245
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:08,272
They basically lost every immunity challenge in the game and one by one they were just decimated

246
00:16:08,652 --> 00:16:14,994
until there was only one tribe member left, Stephanie La Grossa.

247
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:19,735
And because there was no merge, because there was just nothing left of that tribe,

248
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:30,599
Stephanie had to stay one full day at the island by herself, surviving by herself, and

249
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:35,921
sort of shining a new light on the hardship of the setting.

250
00:16:37,084 --> 00:16:45,691
And it was such a poignant TV moment that the producers saw that and actually sort of introduced,

251
00:16:45,731 --> 00:16:52,156
they never said it to us, but they did, introduced a new mechanic which is the Exile Island in which

252
00:16:52,556 --> 00:16:57,860
players have to stay by themselves alone on an island for a day.

253
00:17:00,568 --> 00:17:08,695
And that mechanic already was introduced in the next episode and sort of became kind of a

254
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:16,702
main mechanic of the game for at least a few more seasons until it became kind of redundant.

255
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:22,166
But yeah, that's a really good example of how that mechanic

256
00:17:22,804 --> 00:17:27,269
how the player and what happens in the game can lead to new mechanics.

257
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:33,256
There's also, there's countless other examples, this is just a few of them.

258
00:17:33,576 --> 00:17:40,844
In the circle, again, fairly new shows, so we don't really have that many examples.

259
00:17:41,425 --> 00:17:50,093
But we knew that the idea of the catfish mechanic, where a player can play as different people and not as themselves,

260
00:17:50,573 --> 00:17:59,782
was a huge success, at least in my opinion, when two players who play as catfish go on a date, a virtual date.

261
00:17:59,962 --> 00:18:04,206
So Alex was playing...

262
00:18:04,903 --> 00:18:13,546
as Adam. Alex was married, a married man, a straight married man. He was married, he played

263
00:18:13,606 --> 00:18:20,308
as Adam, like a very handsome single dude, and he had the ability to go on a dinner date with one of

264
00:18:20,368 --> 00:18:27,210
the players, and he chose Rebecca because they sort of had a connection. Rebecca was also a

265
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:32,252
catfish, it was actually Seabird who was Rebecca's boyfriend.

266
00:18:35,954 --> 00:18:42,235
So basically there was a bunch of awkward flirtation

267
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,475
and some really inappropriate questions

268
00:18:46,816 --> 00:18:48,916
and they sort of started this fake relationship.

269
00:18:48,996 --> 00:18:50,316
Again, if you have seen the circle,

270
00:18:50,376 --> 00:18:51,257
they can't see each other.

271
00:18:51,277 --> 00:18:56,758
And it turns to show Rebecca pretended

272
00:18:56,778 --> 00:18:58,618
to be completely crazy over Adam,

273
00:18:58,698 --> 00:19:01,359
while Adam accurately tries to keep the relationship going.

274
00:19:04,113 --> 00:19:08,414
Adam was, um, was Alex was cut from the game.

275
00:19:08,794 --> 00:19:10,935
Sibran actually was a finalist.

276
00:19:11,015 --> 00:19:15,116
But, um, these two guys going on a date,

277
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:19,637
these two, uh, not single guys going on a date,

278
00:19:19,757 --> 00:19:21,698
both playing totally different characters,

279
00:19:22,158 --> 00:19:25,159
was just, there was TV gold, frankly.

280
00:19:26,137 --> 00:19:28,741
So, a little development of the gameplay.

281
00:19:28,761 --> 00:19:32,847
So I want to talk a little bit about the development of gameplay strategy

282
00:19:33,027 --> 00:19:35,571
from setting up the alliance in season one of Survivor

283
00:19:36,072 --> 00:19:40,197
to the far more complex strategy deployed today in most of those games

284
00:19:40,598 --> 00:19:41,980
like Shift and Alliance, etc.

285
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:50,093
The simple mechanic and the player interaction means that the strategy of the games evolved over the years.

286
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:53,576
And I wanted to give a quick overview of those.

287
00:19:54,576 --> 00:19:59,439
I should note that most of this is based on Survivor and a bit of Big Brother, as the circle is still fairly new,

288
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,482
but I won't be surprised if it follows the same trajectory.

289
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:05,424
This to say, I might be completely wrong.

290
00:20:07,434 --> 00:20:12,937
So one thing to note is the way the game is played in season one really affects the way in which the

291
00:20:12,957 --> 00:20:19,680
game will be perceived in later season. In season one nobody knows what to do and the overall theme

292
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:27,885
of the game will be determined. So in season one of Survivor Richard Hatch forming an alliance

293
00:20:29,206 --> 00:20:35,909
submitted the game as a strategic game that is based around alliances and making alliances and

294
00:20:35,949 --> 00:20:36,470
breaking them.

295
00:20:37,286 --> 00:20:44,372
With The Circle, for example, Joey's niceness and his friendship with Siobhan

296
00:20:44,492 --> 00:20:52,578
sort of made The Circle a far more wholesome game, and far more, I would say, soft games.

297
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:59,902
And while the game is actually fairly different in international version,

298
00:21:00,783 --> 00:21:07,147
even today when you watch season two of The Circle, that particular strategy of being

299
00:21:07,568 --> 00:21:13,332
genuine and nice continues, even if there's more complex strategies.

300
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,702
By season two, strategies are more refined, players make less mistakes, but there's still

301
00:21:18,722 --> 00:21:21,202
a few cases that will show future players what not to do.

302
00:21:21,643 --> 00:21:27,344
So in Survivor, for example, Colby chose Tina and not a goat, which was Keith.

303
00:21:28,004 --> 00:21:33,166
I won't talk exactly what the goat dynamic is.

304
00:21:34,106 --> 00:21:38,327
And in the circle, for example, the use of Jack kind of...

305
00:21:40,459 --> 00:21:49,987
who was playing Emily, a very sweet sorority girl,

306
00:21:50,047 --> 00:21:53,390
failed the makeup challenge and sort of outed himself

307
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,131
as a catfish.

308
00:21:56,933 --> 00:21:58,714
And more fish are introduced, and it's usually

309
00:21:58,754 --> 00:21:59,815
a much better season.

310
00:22:00,935 --> 00:22:06,276
Season three, the mechanical strategy are more refined and dominant strategy is emerging.

311
00:22:06,396 --> 00:22:09,157
And this is where the game kind of gets a bit stale.

312
00:22:10,077 --> 00:22:13,378
And so at this point, new twists are introduced in order to counter it.

313
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:20,600
So in season three of Survivor, the dominant strategy at this point was begonning, which is

314
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:26,982
that one strong tribe will vote out, one bigger tribe will vote out the smaller tribe.

315
00:22:27,402 --> 00:22:28,743
And so they had to

316
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:36,947
introduce a new mechanic, which is the tribe swap, which is

317
00:22:37,407 --> 00:22:43,591
nowadays a main mechanic in the game, which will make players

318
00:22:43,991 --> 00:22:54,177
basically have more shifting alliance and not just be only

319
00:22:54,197 --> 00:22:56,278
with the alliance with the original tribe.

320
00:22:57,522 --> 00:23:02,445
By season four, new strategies are introduced, probably as a twist on the dominant strategy.

321
00:23:02,485 --> 00:23:12,349
This was very apparent in season four of Survivor, where the smaller tribe managed to basically

322
00:23:12,729 --> 00:23:21,153
vote out the bigger tribe by having two members of the bigger tribe join them as an alliance.

323
00:23:22,175 --> 00:23:23,996
In season one, twists are more common,

324
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:25,377
strategies getting more complex,

325
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:27,898
but new dominant strategies start to emerge.

326
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:31,080
So in season five of Survivor,

327
00:23:32,221 --> 00:23:35,783
there was the strategy of begonning still exists,

328
00:23:35,863 --> 00:23:39,225
but also a new strategy emerged, which was the goat,

329
00:23:39,686 --> 00:23:42,807
which is basically chosen the weaker player

330
00:23:42,867 --> 00:23:44,128
to sit with you at the end,

331
00:23:44,168 --> 00:23:47,630
so you will definitely vote, get the vote.

332
00:23:48,751 --> 00:23:50,292
So it's important to note a little bit

333
00:23:50,312 --> 00:23:51,373
of a dominant strategy.

334
00:23:52,984 --> 00:23:58,048
Dominant strategy is the optimal move for an individual regarding how the other player acts.

335
00:23:58,908 --> 00:24:03,892
And they will quickly make your game stale and so they need to be neutralized as fast as you can.

336
00:24:05,093 --> 00:24:10,137
In reality show it's often done by adding a twist. In Survivor it was the tribe swap and then

337
00:24:10,618 --> 00:24:14,100
idols and many others. There's Circus Season 2 introduced the Joker

338
00:24:14,681 --> 00:24:16,983
and Big Brother is filled with them.

339
00:24:18,281 --> 00:24:22,242
The dominant side can also create uncomfortable and often ugly situations

340
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:26,764
when players are too observed in the reality created in the game

341
00:24:26,804 --> 00:24:29,545
to understand the repercussions of their behavior.

342
00:24:30,285 --> 00:24:33,506
The most planted example was season 39 of Survivor,

343
00:24:33,886 --> 00:24:37,247
where the strategy was for the big player to be kept over the strong player

344
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:39,908
so the player in the middle will have greater chance to win.

345
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:46,041
which is a fairly regular strategy in both Survivor and Big Brother,

346
00:24:46,302 --> 00:24:48,562
but it doesn't make the most interesting of games.

347
00:24:49,682 --> 00:24:53,023
In this case, it means keeping the player that was accused of sexual harassment

348
00:24:53,143 --> 00:24:56,124
over a strong player who happened to be the person who was harassed.

349
00:24:57,284 --> 00:25:01,205
So a weak player was kept in the game despite actions that went beyond strategic

350
00:25:02,005 --> 00:25:04,586
just because everyone knows they can win against him.

351
00:25:05,026 --> 00:25:08,727
The person who accused him was voted out because she was a strong strategic player.

352
00:25:12,174 --> 00:25:13,515
Reality show and game.

353
00:25:13,655 --> 00:25:18,557
So can those show work as more interactive game?

354
00:25:18,657 --> 00:25:20,458
The answer is both yes and no.

355
00:25:20,918 --> 00:25:25,080
The answer is yes, but we have to look what fans have done.

356
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:25,741
Sorry.

357
00:25:27,461 --> 00:25:31,643
Rather, basically, Survivor does have an official release,

358
00:25:31,683 --> 00:25:34,425
a video game or interactive game.

359
00:25:34,505 --> 00:25:35,585
I think there's two of them.

360
00:25:37,961 --> 00:25:40,421
that follows the original mechanic of the game.

361
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:42,222
It's very, very bad.

362
00:25:42,282 --> 00:25:45,122
It's available to play on, I believe, archive.org.

363
00:25:45,342 --> 00:25:46,703
I post a link at the end.

364
00:25:47,323 --> 00:25:50,163
And so this was an example, but it didn't work.

365
00:25:50,544 --> 00:25:54,224
But it doesn't mean that the mechanics of Survivor

366
00:25:54,284 --> 00:25:58,625
cannot work in those order circles, stuff like that.

367
00:25:58,705 --> 00:26:01,806
But we want to look at what the fans have done.

368
00:26:02,767 --> 00:26:05,508
So some examples are, for example,

369
00:26:05,528 --> 00:26:08,750
Survivor Alexa, which was a fan, Alaska, sorry,

370
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:10,771
a fanfic that used dice to determine

371
00:26:10,791 --> 00:26:13,131
the result of each vote.

372
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:17,673
Survivor Edging, which slightly unfortunate name,

373
00:26:17,753 --> 00:26:19,994
but it's an editing metagame in which player

374
00:26:20,054 --> 00:26:22,435
analyzed the editing of the show to determine the result.

375
00:26:22,855 --> 00:26:31,200
the winner. There's a few survivor LARPs or tabletop RPGs like Survivor College Edition

376
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:36,803
and Survivor Quarantine which allow players to play online, usually in Zoom version of Survivor,

377
00:26:36,883 --> 00:26:42,626
and there's videos of those online, you can watch them. And there's the Circle Discord which is a

378
00:26:42,986 --> 00:26:50,771
LARP tabletop RPG that is played on Discord. So what can we learn from all of this?

379
00:26:51,682 --> 00:26:54,544
So first of all, pay attention to your player,

380
00:26:54,685 --> 00:26:58,008
and is there the one who's going to make and break your game?

381
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:05,655
And it's especially important in reality show,

382
00:27:05,855 --> 00:27:09,859
as the casting really changes how the game is every season.

383
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:12,001
Because the rules don't change that much.

384
00:27:13,619 --> 00:27:16,461
We can trace the way in which strategy is evolved in these games,

385
00:27:16,541 --> 00:27:20,324
which can be very useful when looking at games with strong strategic elements

386
00:27:20,425 --> 00:27:22,506
of tempo competition of sort.

387
00:27:23,867 --> 00:27:26,309
Dominant strategy will be introduced.

388
00:27:28,251 --> 00:27:30,953
Some ways in which the show tried to come to them,

389
00:27:31,613 --> 00:27:33,835
for example, in the circle,

390
00:27:34,276 --> 00:27:36,918
because players, especially catfish players,

391
00:27:36,978 --> 00:27:40,561
can just coast and just like...

392
00:27:41,722 --> 00:27:49,546
be nice. The producer actually used the weekly mini-games, which are usually fairly non-sickle,

393
00:27:50,007 --> 00:27:58,411
to out one of the catfish players who did not prepare well for being a catfish.

394
00:28:00,573 --> 00:28:02,895
with their own makeup.

395
00:28:02,995 --> 00:28:05,317
This will mean that next time players who are catfishing

396
00:28:05,337 --> 00:28:07,079
will have to make sure they're really prepared.

397
00:28:07,099 --> 00:28:10,563
In Survivor, the dominant strategy of begonning,

398
00:28:10,643 --> 00:28:17,950
I mentioned this before, was sort of twisted

399
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:22,594
by having the tribe swap, and so making

400
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:24,156
alliances that are more dynamic.

401
00:28:26,249 --> 00:28:31,114
Four, if the mechanic can only be countered by one dominant strategy, then remove it from the game.

402
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:39,564
Edge of extinction in Survivor, a. when losing players are sent to another island and have the chance to come back to the game,

403
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:44,597
really has one way for the player to win, by giving up immunity in the last try or cancel.

404
00:28:44,918 --> 00:28:53,426
And so by the second time this strategy appeared, the players themselves really disliked it and

405
00:28:53,466 --> 00:28:55,948
basically the mechanic was cancelled.

406
00:28:57,285 --> 00:29:00,808
Five, just because a mechanic was successful or unsuccessful in one season

407
00:29:01,168 --> 00:29:03,950
doesn't mean the dynamic in the next season will be the same.

408
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:09,934
One world in Survivor was a great idea, but the players in the season were so awful that the plan didn't work.

409
00:29:10,835 --> 00:29:18,140
XR Island was a great concept, but it ran its course fairly quickly.

410
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:23,404
Six, a very good mechanic will allow strategy to become complex and the game to not be stangled.

411
00:29:26,384 --> 00:29:31,367
Seven, simplicity is key for emergent but messy game can work if the overall gameplay

412
00:29:31,407 --> 00:29:33,048
compensates for the messiness.

413
00:29:33,789 --> 00:29:39,513
Big Brother and Survivor are very messy with a lot of useless twists, but if the contenders

414
00:29:39,573 --> 00:29:44,817
are interesting and there's enough interesting strategy, you'll be forgiven.

415
00:29:46,999 --> 00:29:52,500
Survivor Fiji has the worst twist in the game, but since the player were interested in it

416
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:57,161
and the gameplay was good, it's not a bad season despite being so messy.

417
00:29:59,581 --> 00:30:03,682
Eight, it doesn't matter if the gameplay is good, if the player are bad, the game is no longer enjoyable.

418
00:30:03,722 --> 00:30:08,223
Survivor World Apart had pretty good strategy and gameplay, but everyone involved was so helpful

419
00:30:08,543 --> 00:30:11,003
that it became an unpleasant viewing experience.

420
00:30:12,503 --> 00:30:15,424
The games are often unfair, but if the narrative is well constructed,

421
00:30:15,444 --> 00:30:15,724
it's worth it.

422
00:30:17,925 --> 00:30:18,965
the player will forgive you.

423
00:30:20,245 --> 00:30:21,646
For example, no player in the circle

424
00:30:21,726 --> 00:30:23,206
often does not have a chance to win,

425
00:30:23,686 --> 00:30:25,707
and luck plays a big role in Survivor.

426
00:30:26,927 --> 00:30:27,507
Give the player 10.

427
00:30:29,448 --> 00:30:30,948
Give the player freedom, but make sure

428
00:30:30,968 --> 00:30:34,249
that you still have control without being obvious about it.

429
00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:36,629
Adding twists to the game or new mechanic

430
00:30:36,689 --> 00:30:38,290
is a way to make sure you're still in control

431
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,570
of the overall gameplay.

432
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,931
The idol in Survivor is a good example.

433
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,092
giving a player enough freedom how to use it,

434
00:30:46,433 --> 00:30:48,054
but you're the one who decides where it is

435
00:30:48,114 --> 00:30:50,095
and how many there will be in the game.

436
00:30:50,976 --> 00:30:54,138
A little bit harder in the circle

437
00:30:54,218 --> 00:30:57,801
because there's only two seasons.

438
00:30:57,961 --> 00:31:01,864
And 11, moderation is important.

439
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,706
Something really bad thing will happen,

440
00:31:03,726 --> 00:31:05,507
and you need to anticipate them and stop them.

441
00:31:06,388 --> 00:31:08,309
The method of season 13 of Survivor

442
00:31:08,349 --> 00:31:09,810
would have been maybe not so awful

443
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:11,411
if the producer would have kicked out

444
00:31:11,511 --> 00:31:12,812
them the first time.

445
00:31:14,012 --> 00:31:15,954
in a properly touch female players.

446
00:31:17,114 --> 00:31:20,817
Okay, before I finish, just a bunch of links.

447
00:31:21,597 --> 00:31:23,518
This is some of the stuff I use

448
00:31:23,858 --> 00:31:27,000
or some of the connection,

449
00:31:27,381 --> 00:31:32,123
some of the videos and stuff I looked at.

450
00:31:33,444 --> 00:31:39,628
Once you have the slides, you can check the link.

451
00:31:40,589 --> 00:31:42,149
And thank you very much.

452
00:31:43,937 --> 00:31:48,705
If you have any questions, I will be in the Q&A after and this is all my information where

453
00:31:48,725 --> 00:31:52,691
you can find me on social media or the internet.
