1
00:00:06,296 --> 00:00:08,543
All right, my fellow hiring managers,

2
00:00:08,563 --> 00:00:10,972
a new job application has just come in.

3
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:12,798
Let's see what we have.

4
00:00:14,132 --> 00:00:15,373
Word nerd alert.

5
00:00:15,793 --> 00:00:19,436
Okay, a long time gamer, picks up new software quickly,

6
00:00:19,556 --> 00:00:21,317
no coding skills, not great.

7
00:00:22,178 --> 00:00:24,660
Bachelor of fine arts, a game artist then,

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,421
in creative writing.

9
00:00:26,921 --> 00:00:28,683
That sounds marketable.

10
00:00:28,703 --> 00:00:32,245
Okay, another degree, awesome.

11
00:00:33,506 --> 00:00:35,768
History, I'm just fending off the job offers

12
00:00:35,788 --> 00:00:36,949
with a bat here, huh?

13
00:00:38,313 --> 00:00:39,394
Any advanced degrees?

14
00:00:39,694 --> 00:00:39,954
No?

15
00:00:39,974 --> 00:00:40,614
OK.

16
00:00:41,255 --> 00:00:41,755
Hobbies?

17
00:00:42,295 --> 00:00:42,955
Hell's bells.

18
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:46,097
Just look at this mess.

19
00:00:46,877 --> 00:00:48,638
This is a parent's worst nightmare, isn't it?

20
00:00:48,658 --> 00:00:51,979
This is like, honey, the kid is never moving out of the basement.

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,801
And if you had not guessed by now, this is my skill set.

22
00:00:59,322 --> 00:01:03,686
I never imagined that I could not just use my love of storytelling in my job,

23
00:01:03,766 --> 00:01:08,249
but actually have it be the main reason I get paid in real human monies and everything.

24
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,494
Mind you, my career path to where I am now was deeply weird and inefficient.

25
00:01:14,154 --> 00:01:19,058
I essentially hurled myself off my career's diving board blindfolded.

26
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:23,103
I somehow ended up in the water instead of braining myself on the pool's edge,

27
00:01:23,223 --> 00:01:27,629
but I wish that a decade ago someone had given me the talk I'm about to give you.

28
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,052
It would have cut eye holes into that blindfold,

29
00:01:30,393 --> 00:01:33,437
and that's the first vital step towards becoming a superhero.

30
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:38,245
The TLDR about me, I've been in the industry since 2006.

31
00:01:38,925 --> 00:01:42,127
I've worked on a bunch of games in a bunch of genres,

32
00:01:42,348 --> 00:01:44,669
and I've been on both sides of the hiring desk

33
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:45,770
more than a few times.

34
00:01:46,571 --> 00:01:49,053
I convinced my current company to create a position for me,

35
00:01:49,273 --> 00:01:51,975
and yes, obviously, I go by Khan professionally,

36
00:01:51,995 --> 00:01:54,236
because if you have that last name, why wouldn't you?

37
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,391
Exactly. When I tell someone in the industry what I do,

38
00:02:00,232 --> 00:02:01,633
the most common question I'm asked is,

39
00:02:01,653 --> 00:02:03,694
ooh, how do you get into narrative design?

40
00:02:03,734 --> 00:02:05,535
Which is usually immediately followed by,

41
00:02:05,895 --> 00:02:08,216
and what is it that you do exactly?

42
00:02:09,013 --> 00:02:11,975
So I'll briefly cover what narrative design is and what it isn't,

43
00:02:12,295 --> 00:02:14,236
and which skills you might already have

44
00:02:14,757 --> 00:02:18,018
that would help you become one even without any narrative experience.

45
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:22,761
As with all game dev, getting your foot in the door is the hardest part.

46
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:26,023
But if you know how to find relevant jobs at home or abroad,

47
00:02:26,543 --> 00:02:28,644
you can stack the deck in your favor to get them.

48
00:02:29,472 --> 00:02:32,254
or even convince a studio to create the job you want.

49
00:02:32,954 --> 00:02:35,575
So I hope you'll walk a day knowing that you can take the plunge

50
00:02:36,275 --> 00:02:39,377
and successfully transition into narrative design from another discipline

51
00:02:39,457 --> 00:02:43,279
by making your existing expertise into your unique selling point,

52
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:47,061
and that if you love storytelling, you can get paid to do it.

53
00:02:48,881 --> 00:02:50,762
Two quick housekeeping notes before we move on.

54
00:02:50,942 --> 00:02:52,942
I talk fast, I cycle through slides quickly,

55
00:02:53,082 --> 00:02:54,863
and I don't want you to have to hover with your phone

56
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:56,543
ready to go at all times,

57
00:02:56,723 --> 00:02:59,524
so I have marked any vaguely useful reference slides

58
00:02:59,904 --> 00:03:01,284
with a camera icon in the top right.

59
00:03:01,384 --> 00:03:03,164
These are probably text-heavy slides.

60
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,485
I'm likely not going to be reading them all off,

61
00:03:05,925 --> 00:03:07,005
so take a pic, read them later,

62
00:03:07,185 --> 00:03:09,846
or check them out on GDC Vault after this.

63
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:13,647
And the other thing is I've had atrocious tech issues,

64
00:03:13,807 --> 00:03:16,668
so some animations may be a little funky.

65
00:03:16,728 --> 00:03:17,288
Please bear with me.

66
00:03:18,308 --> 00:03:22,452
So, what is it? It is mysterious and misunderstood.

67
00:03:23,873 --> 00:03:31,740
Last year, I met an executive. I said, hi, I'm Khan. I'm the senior narrative designer, and he immediately replied, yeah, that's not a real thing.

68
00:03:32,982 --> 00:03:39,628
You're gonna have to get used to explaining what it is and being a champion for it in your project as well as as a

69
00:03:39,668 --> 00:03:40,488
discipline as a whole.

70
00:03:41,369 --> 00:03:44,231
Narrative departments tend to be very small, if they exist at all.

71
00:03:44,572 --> 00:03:48,975
Big companies might have both writers and narrative designers on staff, but many only

72
00:03:49,035 --> 00:03:53,218
hire freelance writers when necessary and otherwise rely on game designers to do their

73
00:03:53,258 --> 00:03:53,638
own writing.

74
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:58,221
The main difference between it and writing is this.

75
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:04,747
A game writer's primary responsibility is to promote the story that is told in the scripts

76
00:04:05,008 --> 00:04:05,408
they write.

77
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:10,977
Their job is to choose the cleanest, clearest, highest quality words they can assemble and

78
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:13,041
give them to other devs to put them into the game.

79
00:04:14,634 --> 00:04:19,658
A narrative designer writes as well, but our primary job is getting the whole game to tell

80
00:04:19,698 --> 00:04:20,498
the same story.

81
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:24,881
We help create the story and then coordinate the different disciplines in the project to

82
00:04:24,901 --> 00:04:25,602
tell it together.

83
00:04:25,862 --> 00:04:29,184
Our most important storytelling tool is not the written word.

84
00:04:29,765 --> 00:04:32,247
We use the game's feature set to tell the story.

85
00:04:32,847 --> 00:04:35,029
And I do mean all of its features.

86
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:41,734
All of this is gameplay, and it will all tell a story with you or without you.

87
00:04:42,155 --> 00:04:47,119
So you better join forces. Ask me sometime about the hydrosimil animation. It's hilarious.

88
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:52,944
Anyway, the central part of this primary job is preventing the game's story and the player's

89
00:04:53,004 --> 00:04:59,110
experience from contradicting each other. You've all seen ludonarrative dissonance in some form.

90
00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:04,199
If the game's HUD, if it's the heads-up display,

91
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,422
is sci-fi and futuristic,

92
00:05:06,482 --> 00:05:09,826
but the story involves dragons and archers.

93
00:05:11,268 --> 00:05:13,370
Or if the music is super tense and dramatic

94
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,634
during dull crafting gameplay, you get the idea.

95
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:19,137
So, cool.

96
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:21,855
It depends on the project, the company,

97
00:05:21,975 --> 00:05:23,056
and the seniority of the position.

98
00:05:23,076 --> 00:05:24,496
I'm afraid there's no one answer to this.

99
00:05:24,556 --> 00:05:27,357
I've done a great many things in a decade of narrative design

100
00:05:27,397 --> 00:05:30,098
from script writing to monetizing live events.

101
00:05:30,178 --> 00:05:31,299
I mean, there's a real range here.

102
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:34,340
And we also handle normal game designer work

103
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,061
like tracking tasks and communicating and documenting

104
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:39,241
feature designs and using a game editor.

105
00:05:40,002 --> 00:05:42,945
But to give you a clearer idea, let's see what kind of skills

106
00:05:42,985 --> 00:05:44,426
you already have that would apply.

107
00:05:45,047 --> 00:05:47,029
Narrative design is intensely cross-functional,

108
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,631
so these are the ones to highlight in your job

109
00:05:49,671 --> 00:05:50,252
application.

110
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:51,253
And also, don't freak out.

111
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:53,495
I don't have half the skills I'm about to list,

112
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,496
and you don't have to either.

113
00:05:55,237 --> 00:05:56,078
Hi, audio people.

114
00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:00,072
You have skills that most narrative designers really need

115
00:06:00,292 --> 00:06:02,275
and don't acquire until we level up later.

116
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,358
And the ability to communicate with an audio designer

117
00:06:05,438 --> 00:06:08,421
or a sound engineer in their own jargon helps a lot.

118
00:06:08,522 --> 00:06:10,844
You will be able to cut a lot of time

119
00:06:10,944 --> 00:06:11,965
off of a recording session.

120
00:06:13,342 --> 00:06:18,144
Art, 2D or 3D, meatspace, digital, graphic design,

121
00:06:18,264 --> 00:06:20,565
fine art, tech art, cinematics, animation.

122
00:06:21,285 --> 00:06:23,126
Speaking to artists, again, in their own language

123
00:06:23,206 --> 00:06:24,786
means that you can contribute to discussions

124
00:06:24,846 --> 00:06:26,607
about visual elements and help create

125
00:06:26,727 --> 00:06:28,888
or give feedback on cut scenes.

126
00:06:30,664 --> 00:06:32,205
Non-game entertainment too.

127
00:06:32,945 --> 00:06:34,486
It's not just acting and directing.

128
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,309
Set and costume design and the research that goes into it

129
00:06:37,369 --> 00:06:39,430
comes up surprisingly often.

130
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:42,373
And behind the scenes logistics can be pretty similar

131
00:06:42,473 --> 00:06:43,954
from getting something on stage

132
00:06:43,994 --> 00:06:46,176
to getting something into a cinematic cut scenes.

133
00:06:46,216 --> 00:06:47,557
A lot of it is project management.

134
00:06:48,718 --> 00:06:52,420
Coding, oh, I really wish I had actual skills in this field.

135
00:06:53,381 --> 00:06:56,023
If you do, you probably know you can write your own ticket.

136
00:06:56,564 --> 00:06:58,465
So why not write one that takes you to career

137
00:06:58,505 --> 00:07:00,046
in storytelling if you like to do that?

138
00:07:01,423 --> 00:07:04,045
QA, a narrative designer needs to be able to spot plot holes.

139
00:07:04,705 --> 00:07:08,647
But more importantly, a good QA testers, meticulous,

140
00:07:08,747 --> 00:07:10,828
process-oriented thinking will help

141
00:07:10,868 --> 00:07:14,069
you keep pipelines and storylines alike straight.

142
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,151
Sales and marketing are about selling an idea.

143
00:07:18,631 --> 00:07:20,252
And that's what narrative design is too,

144
00:07:20,392 --> 00:07:22,213
except the idea is the game's story.

145
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,213
And you get to cuss a lot more.

146
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:27,590
Production, goodness gracious.

147
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,393
As we advance in our careers, these

148
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:32,775
are the skill sets that go from being nice to have

149
00:07:32,956 --> 00:07:34,617
to being the reason you get hired.

150
00:07:35,098 --> 00:07:36,720
Especially as you go up in narrative design,

151
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,803
a lot of your work is about coordinating other people.

152
00:07:41,084 --> 00:07:43,747
Game designers, you'll have an easier time of it than many,

153
00:07:43,867 --> 00:07:46,370
but you will need to perfect your creative writing

154
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:47,971
and technical writing skills.

155
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:51,484
Level designers, same as game design,

156
00:07:51,584 --> 00:07:53,849
your familiarity with editors and scripting

157
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:55,673
and player progression, all very useful,

158
00:07:56,194 --> 00:07:57,877
but you'll need to work probably even harder

159
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,202
on your technical documentation and creative writing chops.

160
00:08:01,491 --> 00:08:03,772
And writers, your writing chops are hopefully fine,

161
00:08:04,273 --> 00:08:06,694
but your task is to beef up your design skills,

162
00:08:06,914 --> 00:08:07,955
so it's time for a game jam.

163
00:08:09,196 --> 00:08:10,797
If I haven't mentioned a skill set you have,

164
00:08:10,837 --> 00:08:12,198
you're wondering how it would apply,

165
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:13,719
please do ask me afterwards.

166
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:17,221
So you might be wondering if these skills are enough,

167
00:08:17,461 --> 00:08:20,723
or if having no explicitly narrative design experience

168
00:08:20,803 --> 00:08:22,504
would prevent you from succeeding.

169
00:08:23,925 --> 00:08:25,486
To succeed, prepare.

170
00:08:26,046 --> 00:08:28,767
You'll need to learn your stuff beforehand as well as learning

171
00:08:28,827 --> 00:08:29,348
on the job.

172
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,429
Join the International Game Design Association's

173
00:08:32,569 --> 00:08:35,750
special interest groups for game design and game writing.

174
00:08:36,751 --> 00:08:37,651
Ask questions.

175
00:08:38,171 --> 00:08:39,272
Ask for recommended reading.

176
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:42,173
I have a few recommendations, but this is hardly

177
00:08:42,253 --> 00:08:43,273
an all-inclusive list.

178
00:08:44,394 --> 00:08:47,076
Look for the intersections of your current discipline

179
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:48,177
with narrative design.

180
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:51,159
In other words, find the people who are the storytellers

181
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:53,821
in your fields and then look for content

182
00:08:53,861 --> 00:08:55,222
made by narrative designers.

183
00:08:55,643 --> 00:08:57,564
Figure out how you can tell your stories.

184
00:08:58,765 --> 00:09:01,107
Start consuming games critically,

185
00:09:01,327 --> 00:09:03,829
looking at what stories they tell and how they tell them.

186
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,851
Play games outside your favorite genres,

187
00:09:05,971 --> 00:09:08,433
play on mobile as well as PC and console,

188
00:09:08,713 --> 00:09:10,695
take notes, take it seriously.

189
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:17,100
No one will pay you to tell stories in games if you can't explain how games tell stories.

190
00:09:19,362 --> 00:09:22,926
Communication and soft skills in general are not optional.

191
00:09:23,387 --> 00:09:30,054
Game design and narrative design are both basically 1% having an idea and 90% making people talk to each other.

192
00:09:30,975 --> 00:09:33,818
So work at becoming a facilitator if you want to succeed.

193
00:09:35,765 --> 00:09:37,867
If you poll your attendees, your fellow attendees,

194
00:09:37,927 --> 00:09:40,650
over a drink, you will get plenty of examples

195
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:45,074
and probably rants about major expensive problems

196
00:09:45,174 --> 00:09:48,216
caused by a lack of clear and consistent vision.

197
00:09:49,217 --> 00:09:51,419
I believe one of the best ways to succeed early on

198
00:09:51,439 --> 00:09:54,622
as a narrative designer is to become the designated driver

199
00:09:54,702 --> 00:09:55,623
for vision keeping.

200
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:58,365
Not the person who sets the vision, that'd be nice,

201
00:09:58,465 --> 00:09:58,806
but you know.

202
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:03,867
but an acknowledged point of contact for the team's questions about the project's direction.

203
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:07,107
Use your position as a newbie to your advantage.

204
00:10:07,447 --> 00:10:10,108
Question your teammates about the vision for their features.

205
00:10:11,048 --> 00:10:15,169
Use that to create a list of questions for the leads to further clarify what their intent

206
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:17,049
is and identify any misalignment.

207
00:10:17,609 --> 00:10:21,890
And then once you know who has the final word on the project's vision and direction, get

208
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:26,551
some time on the calendar and make sure you understand their vision using the questions

209
00:10:26,571 --> 00:10:26,991
you prepped.

210
00:10:27,926 --> 00:10:33,287
Then use their answers to make reference infographics and put them on the wall.

211
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:39,129
It is weird how much more useful a physical game on the wall is than digital documentation.

212
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:43,170
One thing you see every time you need to go to the bathroom and one you have to go looking for.

213
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:48,011
So keep these updated. Become the go-to person for questions anyone has.

214
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:52,749
If your new team is unused to including narrative

215
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,810
in its workflow, use the first few weeks

216
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,991
to start to identify the ways they could use you,

217
00:10:57,171 --> 00:11:00,272
including cheap, that's a very important word here,

218
00:11:00,352 --> 00:11:05,354
cheap ways to add narrative elements to the studio's games

219
00:11:07,555 --> 00:11:09,695
using the existing mechanics and feature set.

220
00:11:10,175 --> 00:11:12,396
You might want to use your fellow devs' voice talent,

221
00:11:12,876 --> 00:11:15,237
add flavor text using the tutorial system

222
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,178
that they already have, put character backgrounds

223
00:11:17,258 --> 00:11:18,458
on the game's website.

224
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:22,320
Prepare a list of ideas and refine it regularly.

225
00:11:23,241 --> 00:11:25,742
Before, however, you make any suggestions,

226
00:11:26,403 --> 00:11:28,424
get time and scope estimates

227
00:11:28,464 --> 00:11:30,665
from any other disciplines involved.

228
00:11:31,486 --> 00:11:33,987
I have an idea that will only take three days

229
00:11:34,047 --> 00:11:36,689
from UI to execute and look at all of these benefits

230
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:39,850
is much more convincing than I have an idea

231
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,671
and I think it would be super cool.

232
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:46,291
The one thing that will most stack the deck for you

233
00:11:46,851 --> 00:11:48,852
is a killer narrative design portfolio.

234
00:11:49,712 --> 00:11:51,993
Plan to work on it pretty much constantly

235
00:11:52,073 --> 00:11:53,213
from now until retirement.

236
00:11:54,773 --> 00:11:56,854
I was recently asked to critique someone's portfolio.

237
00:11:56,974 --> 00:11:58,575
They'd been hunting for months with no luck.

238
00:11:59,015 --> 00:12:00,775
I gave them advice and I will now give it to you

239
00:12:00,815 --> 00:12:01,976
in a more organized format.

240
00:12:03,136 --> 00:12:05,457
I got a nice box of chocolates and a bottle of wine

241
00:12:05,497 --> 00:12:07,778
from them when they were recently hired at Arkane Studios.

242
00:12:08,298 --> 00:12:10,659
So, that's the only reason I suppose you should listen to me.

243
00:12:12,516 --> 00:12:19,202
Every time you apply to a new role, the portfolio you submit has to be tailored to that application.

244
00:12:19,963 --> 00:12:24,527
Most relevant content at the top, fantasy writing at the top for a swords and sorcery RPG,

245
00:12:25,007 --> 00:12:29,832
military themed pieces at the top for an FPS, include only four or five separate pieces.

246
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:36,217
In fact, create two portfolios, a master one with absolutely everything that you're proud of

247
00:12:37,018 --> 00:12:38,980
and that is never shown to a hiring manager.

248
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:43,078
and a modular narrative design portfolio you can plug and play.

249
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,282
Writing samples alone, no matter how good they are,

250
00:12:48,322 --> 00:12:49,102
won't get you hired.

251
00:12:50,483 --> 00:12:52,585
And also, I don't care how talented you are,

252
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:57,028
writing is mostly about editing and revising, not talent.

253
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:00,751
Creative writing is about careful choice.

254
00:13:01,651 --> 00:13:04,113
Edit first with a machete and then with a scalpel.

255
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:09,306
Any older work you're even considering should be thoroughly revised and cleaned up before

256
00:13:09,346 --> 00:13:12,028
you consider including it in your master portfolio.

257
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,959
It should contain writing samples

258
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:18,461
that demonstrate your ability to set a scene in a few words,

259
00:13:19,121 --> 00:13:21,802
to convey different characters through their spoken dialogue,

260
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:24,924
and examples of game-specific or genre-specific writing.

261
00:13:25,524 --> 00:13:27,365
And also include technical writing.

262
00:13:27,865 --> 00:13:30,746
Tutorial steps or first-time user experiences

263
00:13:31,326 --> 00:13:33,547
are great to see in a portfolio,

264
00:13:34,068 --> 00:13:37,589
as are item names and maybe marketing descriptions

265
00:13:38,189 --> 00:13:38,890
for those items.

266
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,891
The portfolio you send out

267
00:13:41,731 --> 00:13:43,712
should, however, prove that you can write well

268
00:13:44,373 --> 00:13:46,714
and that you understand game design elements.

269
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,216
So mission design and dialogue,

270
00:13:49,777 --> 00:13:51,778
or names of achievements and an explanation

271
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:53,499
of why you chose them for that franchise.

272
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,661
Highlight any technical abilities you have

273
00:13:56,781 --> 00:13:59,903
if you've made working prototypes or mods or maps,

274
00:14:00,184 --> 00:14:02,565
link them early on and for God's sakes,

275
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:05,007
check that your links work.

276
00:14:06,062 --> 00:14:07,403
on Mac or mobile too.

277
00:14:08,063 --> 00:14:10,645
Don't ask me to download some sketchy .x file

278
00:14:10,665 --> 00:14:11,685
because I am not gonna.

279
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:15,207
A link to a play through video on YouTube will do just fine.

280
00:14:16,248 --> 00:14:17,529
Highlight any experience you have

281
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:20,511
with the process of getting narrative into games,

282
00:14:21,131 --> 00:14:22,772
briefs for outsourced artists,

283
00:14:23,192 --> 00:14:25,974
putting contracts out to tender if you're a project manager,

284
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,536
creating estimates or roadmaps.

285
00:14:28,936 --> 00:14:30,877
Leverage your existing knowledge set.

286
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:34,480
One last note on contents.

287
00:14:36,053 --> 00:14:37,915
Narrative design, like game writing,

288
00:14:38,255 --> 00:14:41,138
skews slightly more female than most disciplines.

289
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:45,122
If I am the hiring manager, and I

290
00:14:45,182 --> 00:14:47,965
see a portfolio full of lazy stereotypes

291
00:14:48,505 --> 00:14:50,968
or featuring only male characters

292
00:14:51,028 --> 00:14:53,010
so that I can't tell whether you can even write female

293
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,851
characters, then, well.

294
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,596
Now, on to formatting your portfolio.

295
00:15:00,747 --> 00:15:07,736
The TLDR is that navigating it should be a curated, organized experience, even from a recruiter's phone.

296
00:15:08,979 --> 00:15:12,122
Prevent a wall of text with a small intro section,

297
00:15:12,422 --> 00:15:13,884
even before the table of contents,

298
00:15:13,944 --> 00:15:16,586
which spells out which skills each piece illustrates.

299
00:15:16,706 --> 00:15:19,288
Use a Mad Libs style if that helps you remember

300
00:15:19,349 --> 00:15:20,249
what you want to talk about.

301
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:24,333
The ABC section shows mission dialogue

302
00:15:24,493 --> 00:15:28,817
in a blah genre setting where I had N lines per mission

303
00:15:28,897 --> 00:15:34,402
to establish, X, Y, and Z to an LMNOP audience.

304
00:15:35,243 --> 00:15:37,524
By contrast, in the DEF section, you get the idea.

305
00:15:38,444 --> 00:15:41,385
This is partly for the optics, so that the first thing

306
00:15:41,405 --> 00:15:44,366
that a hiring manager sees isn't this long, ugly table

307
00:15:44,406 --> 00:15:46,066
of contents, which will make you go,

308
00:15:46,086 --> 00:15:48,727
how much reading do I have to do today?

309
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:49,727
I've got a meeting in an hour.

310
00:15:50,007 --> 00:15:53,448
But it's mostly to prove that you can edit yourself

311
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:56,609
and that you can select appropriate content to show off.

312
00:15:57,751 --> 00:16:04,174
Don't make me read lots of irrelevant stuff to find out if you can actually write and design for my game's genre.

313
00:16:04,694 --> 00:16:07,516
Make it clear as to why you chose each sample.

314
00:16:09,297 --> 00:16:14,438
Revise and then edit and then get a second set of eyes on your spelling and grammar.

315
00:16:15,158 --> 00:16:20,159
A single typo can send your application right down the pile.

316
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:26,120
If you've let errors get through in your portfolio, which should demonstrate your best work, then

317
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,561
I'll assume it shows either a lack of attention to detail or a lack of command of your language

318
00:16:30,601 --> 00:16:30,942
or both.

319
00:16:32,412 --> 00:16:34,894
As for your CV or resume, there's a lot of good advice

320
00:16:34,954 --> 00:16:36,215
out there about polishing it up.

321
00:16:36,315 --> 00:16:39,257
So I'll just add that if you want to be a designer,

322
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:40,578
act like it.

323
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:43,440
Use white space deliberately.

324
00:16:44,221 --> 00:16:46,182
One page, 12 point font, easy to parse.

325
00:16:46,843 --> 00:16:47,663
That's it, moving on.

326
00:16:48,964 --> 00:16:54,408
So, your portfolio is in progress and you're on the hunt.

327
00:16:54,928 --> 00:16:57,850
So you start by going to one of the major industry websites

328
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,192
you know of and typing in narrative.

329
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:05,884
Yeah.

330
00:17:07,505 --> 00:17:09,667
Full disclosure, this is for the UK only, but still,

331
00:17:10,528 --> 00:17:13,430
you're going to have to cast a really wide net.

332
00:17:14,431 --> 00:17:17,233
Use keywords in your searches, and you'll

333
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:19,976
assemble a long list of mostly irrelevant jobs

334
00:17:20,056 --> 00:17:21,277
and narrow it down from there.

335
00:17:22,698 --> 00:17:25,861
Peer really closely at game writer job descriptions

336
00:17:25,901 --> 00:17:26,561
in particular.

337
00:17:27,102 --> 00:17:28,643
Do they really want just a pure writer,

338
00:17:28,763 --> 00:17:31,125
or is there scope to offer further services there?

339
00:17:31,786 --> 00:17:33,267
If they mention joining a writing team,

340
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:34,088
they want a writer.

341
00:17:35,591 --> 00:17:38,457
Aim for the salary range of a game designer.

342
00:17:40,241 --> 00:17:42,145
Non-Americans considering, oops, sorry.

343
00:17:43,895 --> 00:17:47,217
Non-Americans, considering the USA, you'll be offered a lot more.

344
00:17:47,537 --> 00:17:48,959
But remember, there's a lot of hidden costs.

345
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:51,040
Health care can be insanely expensive.

346
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,262
Rents in tech hubs are comparable to central London or Paris,

347
00:17:54,683 --> 00:17:55,664
and you will need a car.

348
00:17:56,484 --> 00:17:59,827
Americans, considering working abroad, their salaries

349
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:01,788
will sound low to you, but remember that you

350
00:18:01,808 --> 00:18:04,570
get a lot of hidden benefits paid for by your taxes.

351
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,913
And the cost of living tends to be much more predictable in Europe.

352
00:18:10,327 --> 00:18:14,254
As for the UK, oh sorry, la la la.

353
00:18:16,237 --> 00:18:20,404
Yeah, ask me again in April or June, yes, Christmas.

354
00:18:20,865 --> 00:18:21,606
Ask me on Valentine's Day.

355
00:18:23,595 --> 00:18:25,896
Look, sell everything you can, store what you can't bear

356
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,317
to sell, and don't be scared.

357
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,898
I moved to Scotland for a contract job

358
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,999
with two suitcases, a carry-on, and a backpack.

359
00:18:32,539 --> 00:18:34,559
Extra baggage fees, by the way, always cheaper

360
00:18:34,579 --> 00:18:35,360
than shipping boxes.

361
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,242
Whether at home or abroad, the type of studio you choose

362
00:18:41,122 --> 00:18:43,223
will determine what kind of work you do.

363
00:18:44,063 --> 00:18:46,304
So option one, spoiler alert, for those

364
00:18:46,324 --> 00:18:50,065
who enjoy Blood, Sweat, and Tears, there is indie

365
00:18:50,145 --> 00:18:50,986
and there is freelance.

366
00:18:52,148 --> 00:18:53,689
Your expertise from another discipline

367
00:18:54,029 --> 00:18:56,290
might make you a really much more attractive candidate here,

368
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,331
as you will need to wear several hats.

369
00:18:58,731 --> 00:19:01,692
And a large hat will be branding and marketing,

370
00:19:01,793 --> 00:19:04,614
because as the resident language person in a smaller studio,

371
00:19:04,694 --> 00:19:06,675
you will be writing a lot of ad copy.

372
00:19:08,596 --> 00:19:10,637
You'll also have to deal with clients

373
00:19:10,737 --> 00:19:12,858
without any protective layers of bureaucracy

374
00:19:12,878 --> 00:19:14,339
that larger companies might have,

375
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,860
which can be a serious threat to mental health.

376
00:19:21,382 --> 00:19:23,764
Option two is, of course, AAA.

377
00:19:25,225 --> 00:19:27,246
If you don't have any narrative experience yet,

378
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:31,290
being hired by a AAA studio as a narrative designer

379
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,812
is fairly unlikely, unless all the stars are aligned

380
00:19:33,992 --> 00:19:36,174
and your portfolio is face-meltingly awesome.

381
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,622
So option three might be more applicable,

382
00:19:40,742 --> 00:19:42,704
and these are the sort of corporate game mills.

383
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,787
I don't really know what the term for them is.

384
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:48,331
It's more casual, here we go,

385
00:19:49,132 --> 00:19:51,114
more casual free to play games,

386
00:19:51,194 --> 00:19:53,357
mobile, browser, small games.

387
00:19:55,064 --> 00:19:57,706
They can make amazing contributions

388
00:19:57,746 --> 00:19:58,987
to your CV and portfolio.

389
00:19:59,007 --> 00:20:00,007
They can really buff it up.

390
00:20:00,788 --> 00:20:02,829
High churn, multiple projects, that

391
00:20:02,889 --> 00:20:05,390
means you can pinch hit and learn new skills on the job.

392
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,833
Caveats, they do tend to approach games as a business,

393
00:20:08,993 --> 00:20:10,093
and depending on the country, can

394
00:20:10,133 --> 00:20:12,335
have quite corporate attitudes and company cultures.

395
00:20:12,955 --> 00:20:15,557
They can be less familiar with hiring from overseas,

396
00:20:15,597 --> 00:20:17,838
so you might need to help their HR department out

397
00:20:17,898 --> 00:20:19,379
a little more than you would normally

398
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:20,740
with things like visa processes.

399
00:20:21,941 --> 00:20:25,083
And you may need to be even more of an advocate

400
00:20:25,184 --> 00:20:27,145
for narrative design than normal,

401
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:29,568
because they will likely use dev pipelines

402
00:20:29,608 --> 00:20:31,289
in which they're not used to including narrative.

403
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:35,273
Option four, sorry, hold on.

404
00:20:36,154 --> 00:20:38,756
Option four, outsourcing studios, especially in Asia,

405
00:20:39,136 --> 00:20:40,137
who do work for hire.

406
00:20:41,058 --> 00:20:43,480
The caveats are about the same as they are for game mills,

407
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,482
but I have an ex-colleague who jumped

408
00:20:45,582 --> 00:20:47,784
a huge number of levels all at once.

409
00:20:48,325 --> 00:20:54,349
by virtue of being an English-speaking extrovert who understood Western game design practices.

410
00:20:55,070 --> 00:21:00,314
In exchange for working in an obscure studio in a less desirable city, he was immediately

411
00:21:00,374 --> 00:21:04,797
given a team of designers to train in those practices so that they could use them to make

412
00:21:04,838 --> 00:21:05,938
mobile games for other people.

413
00:21:08,116 --> 00:21:09,957
Option five is to grind for XP.

414
00:21:11,177 --> 00:21:12,978
If you've been applying around

415
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:14,659
and you're not getting any responses

416
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:16,260
because of lack of experience,

417
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,341
you might want to consider doing a narrative adjacent gig

418
00:21:19,401 --> 00:21:20,502
for a year or so.

419
00:21:21,502 --> 00:21:23,523
Adding even slightly relevant experience

420
00:21:23,603 --> 00:21:25,324
to your CV could tip the balance.

421
00:21:25,844 --> 00:21:28,186
I taught high school English in Pakistan for a year,

422
00:21:28,486 --> 00:21:29,526
with no training, by the way,

423
00:21:29,967 --> 00:21:32,528
but it put some really marketable skills on my resume.

424
00:21:33,288 --> 00:21:35,250
Speaking to a board audience was one, actually.

425
00:21:36,871 --> 00:21:39,252
Consider companies that provide outsourced translation

426
00:21:39,312 --> 00:21:41,833
or advertising or art or voiceover animation.

427
00:21:41,873 --> 00:21:45,315
They often need liaisons to help interpret the briefs

428
00:21:45,415 --> 00:21:47,897
and feedback they receive from their clients

429
00:21:48,097 --> 00:21:48,918
and communicate back.

430
00:21:50,093 --> 00:21:53,294
So whether you are job searching at home or abroad,

431
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:56,235
there is one more important tool in your toolbox,

432
00:21:56,616 --> 00:21:59,897
which is convincing a studio to create a job for you.

433
00:21:59,917 --> 00:22:05,218
A speculative application is you arguing

434
00:22:05,258 --> 00:22:07,739
for a studio's creation of a new narrative design position.

435
00:22:10,027 --> 00:22:11,629
It's how I got my job at Splash Damage, actually.

436
00:22:13,091 --> 00:22:15,294
These work when you can identify a need

437
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,237
that a studio has for narrative support

438
00:22:17,397 --> 00:22:20,561
before or soon after they realize they have that need.

439
00:22:21,714 --> 00:22:25,418
So, find an appropriate team lead on LinkedIn,

440
00:22:25,518 --> 00:22:27,820
ask for an informational interview.

441
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,523
Okay, informational interview is the important word there.

442
00:22:30,944 --> 00:22:33,246
See if you can get 20 minutes of their time

443
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:35,448
on the phone, in person, for their take

444
00:22:35,508 --> 00:22:37,510
on whether their studio could use narrative.

445
00:22:37,931 --> 00:22:39,993
Ask if the studio is organized by project

446
00:22:40,033 --> 00:22:41,774
or if there's central support departments

447
00:22:41,855 --> 00:22:43,556
like QA or narrative design.

448
00:22:44,917 --> 00:22:47,799
so that you would know what to suggest in your pain letter.

449
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:49,620
That is something that says,

450
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,541
hey, here is why you need story,

451
00:22:51,601 --> 00:22:52,582
and it's causing you trouble,

452
00:22:52,642 --> 00:22:54,503
and here is how I can provide it.

453
00:22:56,363 --> 00:22:59,526
To find the studio, scour industry news.

454
00:22:59,726 --> 00:23:02,348
You're looking for any hints of narrative projects coming up,

455
00:23:02,428 --> 00:23:05,811
any reviews of games that call out bad storytelling,

456
00:23:05,891 --> 00:23:07,973
bad voiceover, bad translation.

457
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:10,055
You can offer to help them with that problem.

458
00:23:11,236 --> 00:23:13,498
Look for ambitious studios who are trying to grow

459
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,159
beyond perhaps more humble roots.

460
00:23:18,002 --> 00:23:22,324
And also see if the studio has any writers already on staff.

461
00:23:22,445 --> 00:23:24,906
Look them up on LinkedIn to see if their game designers seem

462
00:23:24,926 --> 00:23:27,267
to be more systems-focused than content-focused.

463
00:23:28,128 --> 00:23:29,909
And try not to make assumptions based

464
00:23:30,089 --> 00:23:33,271
on the studio's preferred or historical genres of game.

465
00:23:34,111 --> 00:23:36,253
My partner's current mobile game addiction

466
00:23:36,473 --> 00:23:39,514
is a deck-building RPG with a surprising number

467
00:23:39,614 --> 00:23:42,576
of unique voiceover lines for a free-to-play game.

468
00:23:43,497 --> 00:23:46,787
it's too bad that their translation is not actually very good. It's very successful back

469
00:23:46,827 --> 00:23:49,615
home, but it would be nice if they had somebody to check their translations.

470
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:55,531
When you're writing this pain letter, to paraphrase Start

471
00:23:55,571 --> 00:23:58,672
With Why by Simon Sinek, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s

472
00:23:58,732 --> 00:24:03,353
speech was, I have a dream, not I have a plan.

473
00:24:03,894 --> 00:24:07,295
So your first sentence needs to elicit emotion,

474
00:24:07,835 --> 00:24:09,855
be an evocative and passionate statement

475
00:24:09,895 --> 00:24:12,476
about the importance of narrative in their games

476
00:24:12,556 --> 00:24:13,797
or how important it could be.

477
00:24:14,357 --> 00:24:16,458
And then you drop some facts, which I'm not

478
00:24:16,578 --> 00:24:17,918
going to do your research for you.

479
00:24:17,978 --> 00:24:20,159
But they mostly should be based around the fact

480
00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:21,039
that good narrative.

481
00:24:21,499 --> 00:24:23,640
sells more units, there is data out there.

482
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,900
And then you say, I have a plan,

483
00:24:26,081 --> 00:24:28,741
to reassure them that they won't have to do a lot of thinking

484
00:24:29,081 --> 00:24:31,182
to be able to say yes to you.

485
00:24:32,122 --> 00:24:33,763
If they support multiple live projects,

486
00:24:33,823 --> 00:24:35,623
offer yourself as a central resource.

487
00:24:35,744 --> 00:24:37,804
But if they focus on one or two big ones at a time,

488
00:24:38,284 --> 00:24:41,085
state how you would add value to those specifically.

489
00:24:42,386 --> 00:24:43,666
Offer them a probation period.

490
00:24:43,846 --> 00:24:45,046
If it doesn't work out within a year,

491
00:24:45,086 --> 00:24:47,587
you'll exit gracefully, but then you'll have experience.

492
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:51,176
The list of what they would need to do

493
00:24:51,196 --> 00:24:53,217
and what you'd need to do is really sort of should

494
00:24:53,237 --> 00:24:55,218
be ready for the second email, not necessarily

495
00:24:55,238 --> 00:24:55,838
in the first letter.

496
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:00,661
As with any job search, networking is not optional.

497
00:25:01,361 --> 00:25:03,322
Look for relevant networking events online

498
00:25:03,342 --> 00:25:06,243
and in Meetspace with any narrative or writing-focused

499
00:25:06,483 --> 00:25:07,524
groups that you should join.

500
00:25:07,604 --> 00:25:09,345
There's a lot of resources on networking out there.

501
00:25:09,745 --> 00:25:12,446
So I'll just say that, one, if you were

502
00:25:14,147 --> 00:25:18,450
Job searching, and you are not trying to attend at least two networking events per month,

503
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:19,991
you are not taking it very seriously.

504
00:25:20,691 --> 00:25:25,194
And two, the best piece of advice I ever got on how to introduce yourself at any networking

505
00:25:25,254 --> 00:25:25,494
event.

506
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:29,857
Hi, I'm Khan, I heard you might be making GameXYZ next year.

507
00:25:30,397 --> 00:25:31,237
Sounds challenging.

508
00:25:31,638 --> 00:25:34,879
I'd love to chat with you about it if you have five minutes, if not now, maybe this

509
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,140
week?

510
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:36,320
Done.

511
00:25:36,881 --> 00:25:37,201
Sorted.

512
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:42,795
Okay, let's pretend a training montage now happens in the horrible expanse of time that

513
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:46,940
stretches between applying to jobs and getting selected for an interview, and move right

514
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,680
on to interview prep.

515
00:25:48,968 --> 00:25:54,290
You may get a design test before you qualify for an interview,

516
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:57,791
or you may only get one after a successful first interview.

517
00:25:57,991 --> 00:26:00,011
But narrative-specific prep advice,

518
00:26:00,071 --> 00:26:02,032
again, there's other more general advice out there,

519
00:26:02,712 --> 00:26:04,492
narrative-specific advice for both is the same.

520
00:26:05,452 --> 00:26:09,994
Number one, have a very firm grasp of what text goes into a game.

521
00:26:10,794 --> 00:26:14,735
Think about how you would change each one to match a specific setting

522
00:26:14,815 --> 00:26:16,915
and what errors you might run into.

523
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:21,647
Number two, play that company's games

524
00:26:21,987 --> 00:26:24,731
and prepare opinions on what you would do differently

525
00:26:25,111 --> 00:26:27,374
and what you liked and didn't and why,

526
00:26:27,535 --> 00:26:29,457
all within the context, again, of narrative,

527
00:26:29,517 --> 00:26:30,799
character development, and story.

528
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,779
Think about and be prepared to answer or complete

529
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,421
common design test questions or tasks.

530
00:26:38,782 --> 00:26:40,503
This is a big one, so hold on for a second.

531
00:26:42,404 --> 00:26:44,466
The biggest reason to prep for these

532
00:26:44,666 --> 00:26:46,527
instead of trying to answer them on the fly

533
00:26:46,747 --> 00:26:49,429
is to figure out the intent behind the question.

534
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:51,991
If they're asking where you would start

535
00:26:52,071 --> 00:26:54,193
in creating a new region or a quest line

536
00:26:54,253 --> 00:26:55,134
for your favorite game,

537
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:59,915
What they want to know is where you instinctively look for inspiration.

538
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,936
They want to peek into your head and understand your process.

539
00:27:03,236 --> 00:27:05,477
Do you document first or afterwards?

540
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,538
Do you think out loud or on paper?

541
00:27:08,738 --> 00:27:11,719
Do you prefer to brainstorm with people or solo?

542
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:16,160
These are cultural fit questions as well as technical ability questions.

543
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:21,625
I'm happy to talk further about Interview Prep after this talk.

544
00:27:21,805 --> 00:27:24,968
We will be in overlook 3022, which is just across.

545
00:27:25,048 --> 00:27:26,990
So come find me if we run out of time for questions.

546
00:27:28,422 --> 00:27:32,543
So, after listening to me ramble at top speed for a while,

547
00:27:32,563 --> 00:27:36,204
I hope that you have learned a few things.

548
00:27:37,325 --> 00:27:39,545
Narrative design is a misunderstood discipline,

549
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:42,726
but the nice thing about that is that you can define

550
00:27:43,367 --> 00:27:46,808
what kind of narrative designer you wanna be for yourself.

551
00:27:46,908 --> 00:27:48,969
You can find the studio that fits you.

552
00:27:49,129 --> 00:27:52,290
You can define what narrative design means to you.

553
00:27:54,908 --> 00:27:56,149
Because it's a young discipline.

554
00:27:56,169 --> 00:27:57,590
as narrative design.

555
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,672
the same way you would to those.

556
00:28:12,995 --> 00:28:16,078
You can not only apply your current skill set to succeed,

557
00:28:16,158 --> 00:28:19,281
but that skill set is in fact the unique selling point

558
00:28:19,321 --> 00:28:21,924
that will set you apart from your competition

559
00:28:23,045 --> 00:28:27,869
if you can explain how it will add value to their projects.

560
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:32,630
You will succeed if you love language, if you come prepared,

561
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:35,453
if you're willing to learn on the job as well as on your own,

562
00:28:35,553 --> 00:28:36,914
and if you ask good questions.

563
00:28:37,754 --> 00:28:39,916
You will succeed harder if you actively

564
00:28:40,216 --> 00:28:42,598
use and improve your diplomacy and communication

565
00:28:42,618 --> 00:28:44,920
skills to support the team through vision keeping

566
00:28:45,421 --> 00:28:47,222
and adding narrative elements to the project that

567
00:28:47,322 --> 00:28:48,543
use the existing feature set.

568
00:28:50,024 --> 00:28:51,706
Creating an appropriate portfolio

569
00:28:51,786 --> 00:28:53,107
is going to make the difference between you're

570
00:28:53,127 --> 00:28:54,268
getting hired or not.

571
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:57,910
You can find or make a role for yourself.

572
00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:01,211
and you should prepare for interviews and design tests

573
00:29:01,231 --> 00:29:02,131
in about the same way.

574
00:29:03,152 --> 00:29:05,654
The point is, if you love storytelling,

575
00:29:05,674 --> 00:29:07,896
and if you keep the above in mind,

576
00:29:07,976 --> 00:29:10,278
you can get paid for it, and that's actually pretty cool.

577
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:12,300
So, thank you.

578
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:13,681
Any questions?

579
00:29:20,033 --> 00:29:21,474
Please go ahead and come on up to the mic

580
00:29:21,514 --> 00:29:22,435
if you have any questions.

581
00:29:24,017 --> 00:29:25,999
Oh, and we have no time for questions at all.

582
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,923
So I will see you across the hall in Overlook.

583
00:29:30,424 --> 00:29:31,164
Thank you very much.
