1
00:00:24,212 --> 00:00:27,013
Center. Center.

2
00:00:33,374 --> 00:00:35,215
Sound hardware initialized.

3
00:00:36,075 --> 00:00:39,836
This program will install command and conquer to the following directory.

4
00:00:41,116 --> 00:00:46,117
If you wish to install to another directory and or drive, please type it in below.

5
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:52,618
Thank you.

6
00:00:53,569 --> 00:00:59,433
Installing. Please stand by. While you are waiting, please fill out your registration card and send it in.

7
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:01,995
For last minute changes and notes, please examine the README file.

8
00:01:27,623 --> 00:01:28,824
Installation complete.

9
00:01:28,844 --> 00:01:33,086
We're going to have to act, if we want to live in a different world.

10
00:03:59,956 --> 00:04:00,296
All right.

11
00:04:00,516 --> 00:04:01,837
I need my mic, I think.

12
00:04:02,778 --> 00:04:05,519
So as Frank said, everybody, Frank Lepacki, one more time.

13
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:05,599
Woo!

14
00:04:10,943 --> 00:04:11,063
Woo!

15
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:11,243
Woo!

16
00:04:11,263 --> 00:04:11,343
Woo!

17
00:04:11,383 --> 00:04:11,443
Woo!

18
00:04:11,463 --> 00:04:11,523
Woo!

19
00:04:11,723 --> 00:04:11,843
Woo!

20
00:04:11,863 --> 00:04:11,943
Woo!

21
00:04:11,963 --> 00:04:12,023
Woo!

22
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:12,103
Woo!

23
00:04:12,123 --> 00:04:14,064
Welcome to the C&C Classic Game Postmortem.

24
00:04:15,285 --> 00:04:16,506
I got to tell you, I knew that was going

25
00:04:16,526 --> 00:04:17,446
to be really hard to follow.

26
00:04:17,847 --> 00:04:19,588
But at 10 o'clock in the morning on Thursday,

27
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:21,509
we've got to wake everybody up a little bit.

28
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:21,909
Excited.

29
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:23,590
Plus, we want everybody in the other rooms to go,

30
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,951
what the hell is going on in there?

31
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:25,011
So.

32
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,551
Oh.

33
00:04:27,723 --> 00:04:28,724
You know, I'm Lewis Castle.

34
00:04:28,784 --> 00:04:31,886
I'm the co-founder of Westwood Studios, the company that

35
00:04:31,906 --> 00:04:32,867
created Command & Conquer.

36
00:04:33,468 --> 00:04:38,312
And every year I'm on the game developers, the board, the

37
00:04:38,352 --> 00:04:38,912
conference board.

38
00:04:39,233 --> 00:04:43,036
And every year we talk about doing classic postmortems.

39
00:04:43,076 --> 00:04:43,897
We talk about C&C.

40
00:04:44,597 --> 00:04:46,519
And the problem that I always have with C&C is that we've

41
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:49,301
got some folks that aren't in the games industry anymore.

42
00:04:49,801 --> 00:04:52,003
And we've got other folks that just don't want to be on stage

43
00:04:52,023 --> 00:04:52,484
and talk about it.

44
00:04:52,504 --> 00:04:54,045
They're really important and pivotal.

45
00:04:54,565 --> 00:04:55,386
to command and conquer.

46
00:04:55,926 --> 00:04:59,188
And so I just always said, no, I just really don't think it's right.

47
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:04,330
But this year, and kind of serendipitously, I finally just said, you know what?

48
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,211
I have a way of doing this.

49
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:05,691
I figured it out.

50
00:05:05,731 --> 00:05:09,133
What we're just going to do is we're going to go record all of these folks, the ones

51
00:05:09,153 --> 00:05:15,876
that we can, video and audio, and we'll put it all together into something, and that'll

52
00:05:15,896 --> 00:05:16,016
work.

53
00:05:16,477 --> 00:05:18,097
So it's a different format.

54
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:20,178
You guys probably never see a GDC talk like this.

55
00:05:20,258 --> 00:05:22,179
If I had proposed it to myself, I'd probably refuse it,

56
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:24,040
because it's too many people, too complicated,

57
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,120
and really a live guitar.

58
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,281
That's crazy.

59
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:32,103
So on the stage, myself, Louis Castle,

60
00:05:32,403 --> 00:05:33,764
Frank Lepake, we've already talked about.

61
00:05:34,164 --> 00:05:35,785
We have Steve Weatherill, who's the technical director

62
00:05:35,845 --> 00:05:38,706
for Command & Conquer, and Eric Yeo, who is a lead designer.

63
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:47,307
So as I already said, this is going

64
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:49,287
to be a little bit of a different format for a talk.

65
00:05:50,348 --> 00:05:52,448
Like most great games, Command & Conquer,

66
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:55,309
it really wasn't made by any one person.

67
00:05:55,369 --> 00:05:57,790
And we have this cult of personality

68
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,051
that we build in our games industry around our heroes.

69
00:06:00,471 --> 00:06:01,891
And there are certainly some creative directors

70
00:06:01,931 --> 00:06:03,772
that without them, the games could never be made.

71
00:06:04,212 --> 00:06:06,853
But we can't forget the fact that so many people,

72
00:06:06,913 --> 00:06:08,593
so many people like everybody in this audience,

73
00:06:08,673 --> 00:06:11,414
put their hearts and souls into the products that we build.

74
00:06:11,874 --> 00:06:13,215
And it's when all that stuff comes together,

75
00:06:13,275 --> 00:06:15,135
and so many people put it together, that it makes it work.

76
00:06:15,755 --> 00:06:20,658
So these are the people that I was able to both con into putting themselves on video for me

77
00:06:20,698 --> 00:06:22,299
and get them to do a recording.

78
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:27,982
And I will point out right on the front, I recorded this all in Frank's little casita,

79
00:06:28,022 --> 00:06:29,662
which is like an audio recording booth.

80
00:06:30,063 --> 00:06:31,603
So this is not professional video.

81
00:06:31,663 --> 00:06:33,204
This is very much like Command and Conquer.

82
00:06:33,224 --> 00:06:36,226
It's just a bunch of people who are passionate, just throwing something together

83
00:06:36,266 --> 00:06:37,226
to try to entertain people.

84
00:06:37,686 --> 00:06:42,029
So I hope that you appreciate the authenticity of it and, you know, don't review it badly

85
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:45,310
because the AV production is not terribly great.

86
00:06:45,911 --> 00:06:47,572
But it's more important about what people are saying.

87
00:06:48,832 --> 00:06:52,555
So on the video, you're going to have Brett Sperry, who's the co-founder of Westwood Studios,

88
00:06:52,615 --> 00:06:56,117
and he's definitely the creative director behind Command & Conquer.

89
00:06:56,677 --> 00:07:02,741
Joe Koukun, who played Kane, who many people may not realize was actually a video director

90
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:03,121
also.

91
00:07:03,181 --> 00:07:04,001
So he actually cast.

92
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:05,803
and directed all the talent.

93
00:07:06,243 --> 00:07:07,804
Adele Castillo, who is our producer,

94
00:07:08,405 --> 00:07:10,126
Eric Gutch, one of the many artists

95
00:07:10,146 --> 00:07:11,467
that contributed to the videos,

96
00:07:12,228 --> 00:07:14,210
Maria Delmar-McCready-Legg,

97
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,251
who is the engineer

98
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,073
who did all the introduction sequences

99
00:07:18,173 --> 00:07:20,254
to all of the Command & Conquer games, all the way up to Renegade.

100
00:07:20,735 --> 00:07:22,556
I thought it was really cool to get her on there.

101
00:07:22,736 --> 00:07:24,877
And Ted Morris, who was our first community manager,

102
00:07:25,558 --> 00:07:29,100
Bill Randolph, who was one of our lead designer or lead

103
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,501
coders, and then Kaya Montgomery,

104
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:34,123
who was Kaya Hunsinger at the time, who was the voice of Eva.

105
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:36,222
So that's who you're going to hear from today.

106
00:07:36,242 --> 00:07:38,944
Again, this many people in a talk,

107
00:07:39,464 --> 00:07:40,525
I'm going to be moving pretty quickly

108
00:07:40,565 --> 00:07:41,625
because there's a lot to get through.

109
00:07:42,406 --> 00:07:44,927
So I guess without further, oh, sorry,

110
00:07:45,107 --> 00:07:46,068
I don't forget this too.

111
00:07:46,728 --> 00:07:48,989
That actually is just a very, very small sample

112
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:50,910
of all the people that contributed to Command & Conquer.

113
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,131
In fact, these are the credits, the official credits

114
00:07:53,151 --> 00:07:54,772
from the original, just the development team

115
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:55,393
for Command & Conquer.

116
00:07:55,413 --> 00:07:57,674
And this is 1995 when many games

117
00:07:57,694 --> 00:07:59,095
were only made by four or five people.

118
00:07:59,435 --> 00:08:00,715
So it was quite a large group of people.

119
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,878
names are the ones that you're actually going to be hearing from today.

120
00:08:03,898 --> 00:08:05,379
So you can see it's just a small sample.

121
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,001
And I would really be remiss.

122
00:08:07,661 --> 00:08:09,843
I hope they're watching or they'll watch it on the vault.

123
00:08:10,144 --> 00:08:11,885
If I didn't thank all the folks at Virgin

124
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:15,168
for from a series of things, maybe we can get to in the Q&A.

125
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:17,851
Virgin put so much effort behind.

126
00:08:18,191 --> 00:08:22,235
the Westwood games, especially Command & Conquer, and without all the effort they put into it,

127
00:08:22,796 --> 00:08:25,639
I don't know that any of you would be here today and I don't know that it would have

128
00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:26,240
been a success.

129
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:31,866
It's impossible to tell because when so many people contribute so much, how do you sort

130
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:32,206
it all out?

131
00:08:32,226 --> 00:08:33,488
It's just like a big bowl of spaghetti.

132
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:35,750
That's how I've always felt about it.

133
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,912
You'll see that I'm not in the credits actually,

134
00:08:38,472 --> 00:08:39,933
although I did a lot of stuff on the compression

135
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:40,734
and a bunch of other things.

136
00:08:41,295 --> 00:08:44,517
At that time I was working on, oh gosh,

137
00:08:44,597 --> 00:08:46,940
Lion King and Blade Runner and Monopoly

138
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,860
and a bunch of other stuff too.

139
00:08:48,101 --> 00:08:49,642
There's a bunch of folks in the front row here

140
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:50,743
that contributed to Command & Conquer

141
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:51,644
but also not in the credits.

142
00:08:52,084 --> 00:08:53,866
So it's actually only a small sampling

143
00:08:53,886 --> 00:08:54,827
of the people that were kind of on it

144
00:08:54,847 --> 00:08:56,028
from the beginning all the way to the end

145
00:08:56,368 --> 00:08:57,569
and really drove the vision of the game.

146
00:08:58,711 --> 00:09:01,973
So I guess without further ado, let's hear it from Eva.

147
00:09:02,214 --> 00:09:05,056
Tell us what inspired Command & Conquer.

148
00:09:06,437 --> 00:09:11,860
Command & Conquer came about as a result of years and years

149
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,522
of me thinking about what kind of game I wanted to do next,

150
00:09:14,943 --> 00:09:16,704
and a little bit of the zeitgeist,

151
00:09:16,784 --> 00:09:22,288
the spirit of the time, and also a kind of a bet

152
00:09:22,568 --> 00:09:25,530
that I made with another industry executive about.

153
00:09:27,097 --> 00:09:28,338
real-time strategy games.

154
00:09:29,179 --> 00:09:31,541
And the basic bet went something like this.

155
00:09:32,802 --> 00:09:35,303
He said, nobody wants to play strategy games.

156
00:09:35,364 --> 00:09:38,846
And I said, well, no offense, but the reason

157
00:09:38,866 --> 00:09:40,808
why nobody wants to play your strategy games

158
00:09:40,888 --> 00:09:42,189
is because they're really, really boring

159
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:44,411
and you're not doing anything new.

160
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:47,473
You're not pulling anybody into the real meat

161
00:09:47,513 --> 00:09:49,294
and the guts and the fun of what it's all about.

162
00:09:52,705 --> 00:09:55,467
That's Brett Sperry, of course, the creator of Command & Conquer.

163
00:09:56,688 --> 00:10:00,891
I think the next thing I would like to hear from is Frank because I don't know if you

164
00:10:00,911 --> 00:10:04,755
guys have picked up on this or if you remember, but the music of Command & Conquer was like

165
00:10:04,795 --> 00:10:06,776
nothing else anybody's ever heard.

166
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:11,400
So Frank, if you could tell us a little bit about what inspired the style of C&C Music

167
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,703
and where you got your inspiration from and what kind of guided your choices.

168
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:23,103
Yeah, so basically at the time I was 20 years old, and it was a new kind of thing.

169
00:10:23,163 --> 00:10:30,486
We were technologically moving from what at the time was MIDI playback only through sound

170
00:10:30,526 --> 00:10:33,527
chips and whatnot from sound cards, and we were going to streaming audio.

171
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:38,229
Command & Conquer was one of the first games to do that, so I was using synthesizers and

172
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:40,910
live guitar for the first time in a soundtrack that was going to be...

173
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:46,613
used that way. So the kickoff meeting went something like this. I got in, Paul Mudra,

174
00:10:46,653 --> 00:10:51,716
who is the audio director, went into his office with Brett Sperry, and the three of us sat

175
00:10:51,756 --> 00:10:57,680
around and just had a listening party, basically, with stacks of CDs, compact discs.

176
00:10:59,221 --> 00:11:05,588
And we shared different music influences that we thought would be fun to include into the game.

177
00:11:06,128 --> 00:11:08,831
The only problem with that was it was all over the board.

178
00:11:09,112 --> 00:11:15,178
It was everything from movie soundtracks, orchestral stuff, to heavy metal, techno music, hip hop,

179
00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:18,762
you know, and anything in between. Ambient, moody stuff.

180
00:11:19,863 --> 00:11:24,186
So the takeaway from the meeting was, okay, well, we figured out we like a lot of these

181
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:26,127
different elements from all of these things.

182
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,430
Why not try to put them all together and see what sticks?

183
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,372
So it was a big experiment, really.

184
00:11:32,732 --> 00:11:37,596
And the cool thing about this process was that I was allowed to be experimental and

185
00:11:37,636 --> 00:11:40,738
have creative freedom to kind of do what I wanted with that.

186
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:45,101
So that ended up being what C&C became,

187
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:48,202
which was a variety of styles put into that game

188
00:11:48,222 --> 00:11:50,764
that were all allowed to coexist together

189
00:11:50,804 --> 00:11:54,706
and somehow made that environment work in that capacity.

190
00:11:55,526 --> 00:11:57,067
And then the other cool thing we added to that,

191
00:11:57,107 --> 00:11:58,408
of course, was the jukebox mode,

192
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,489
which allowed players to select which tracks

193
00:12:01,549 --> 00:12:03,310
were their favorites that they wanted to go

194
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,731
and annihilate their enemy to.

195
00:12:05,472 --> 00:12:07,453
So that was another fun tidbit.

196
00:12:08,093 --> 00:12:08,433
Thanks, Frank.

197
00:12:09,245 --> 00:12:10,765
And we're going to hear from Brett now a little bit more

198
00:12:10,785 --> 00:12:12,146
about the Command & Conquer universe.

199
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:15,307
Just one little riff, because it's not in the presentation,

200
00:12:15,327 --> 00:12:18,248
but I still remember when Brett said, hey, we've got to

201
00:12:18,268 --> 00:12:20,449
have the full screen audio video for Command & Conquer.

202
00:12:20,469 --> 00:12:22,110
And I was working with Steve and some other folks on the

203
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,371
video compression, because new technology that was built on

204
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,892
some stuff I had written way back in the past.

205
00:12:27,272 --> 00:12:28,333
And I go, I don't know, Brett.

206
00:12:28,953 --> 00:12:31,434
If you look at data entropy and the conversion rate,

207
00:12:31,694 --> 00:12:35,436
there's no video codec that can play on a single-speed CD-ROM

208
00:12:35,456 --> 00:12:37,697
at 44 kilohertz, full-screen audio and video.

209
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,477
It just doesn't exist.

210
00:12:38,497 --> 00:12:40,678
And he goes, oh, Lou, you're just being lazy.

211
00:12:41,239 --> 00:12:44,620
So on to Brett.

212
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:48,702
And the CNC universe was developed very, very slowly

213
00:12:48,762 --> 00:12:50,843
over a long period of time.

214
00:12:52,164 --> 00:12:55,385
Partly, it was created by.

215
00:12:56,836 --> 00:13:02,177
fiction that I had in my brain about some kind of future world and the central

216
00:13:02,298 --> 00:13:09,140
character who we call Cain and the rise of a global defense initiative as the

217
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,061
various armies of Earth

218
00:13:12,181 --> 00:13:16,745
Countries as the order were kind of starting to fade away and there's the rise of sort of a new world order.

219
00:13:16,765 --> 00:13:22,089
You have to remember this was in the late 80s and early 90s when I was thinking about all this kind of stuff.

220
00:13:22,489 --> 00:13:28,133
And then working with team members and saying, well, hey, I want to do this and I want this central theme and I want this central character.

221
00:13:28,153 --> 00:13:32,376
And here's this massive backstory, you know, that I've been thinking about for a long time.

222
00:13:32,897 --> 00:13:36,720
And so, you know, they would contribute parts and pieces to that whole thing.

223
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,382
But, yeah, it took...

224
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:43,813
Like a lot of good stories and a lot of good backstories, you know, the foundation upon

225
00:13:43,873 --> 00:13:50,037
which the game fiction was built on took many, many years of just quiet contemplation and

226
00:13:50,158 --> 00:13:56,963
notes and thinking about how this can make sense also.

227
00:13:57,223 --> 00:14:00,926
Where is the intersection between the fiction and the gameplay?

228
00:14:03,262 --> 00:14:05,443
And so Eric, we'll get you up next,

229
00:14:05,483 --> 00:14:06,423
then why don't you tell us a little bit

230
00:14:06,463 --> 00:14:08,104
about developing Command & Conquer

231
00:14:08,505 --> 00:14:09,725
and what did the world mean to you

232
00:14:09,785 --> 00:14:10,926
and what are your favorite memories

233
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:11,866
of the development process?

234
00:14:13,807 --> 00:14:15,909
Well, the world was really interesting at the time

235
00:14:15,949 --> 00:14:17,970
and it was rife with inspiration,

236
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,750
which was really helpful.

237
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,831
There was a lot of stuff going on in the world at that time.

238
00:14:21,452 --> 00:14:23,333
But I think, as Brett noted,

239
00:14:23,873 --> 00:14:25,354
there was a lot to draw from from the backstory

240
00:14:25,374 --> 00:14:26,935
that he and Joe Bostic had been creating.

241
00:14:27,055 --> 00:14:28,516
So that was a big inspiration

242
00:14:28,556 --> 00:14:30,757
and trying to work with the writers and...

243
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:38,871
milled the story that was being built into the missions and then back out again was interesting

244
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:40,792
and difficult, but also really, really fun.

245
00:14:41,952 --> 00:14:45,773
But I think that was one of the more interesting parts for us was trying to find that intersection

246
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:48,394
and trying to merge the two pieces together.

247
00:14:48,414 --> 00:14:54,655
And a lot of folks have asked in the past, too, where do we get the visual inspiration

248
00:14:54,675 --> 00:14:54,815
stuff?

249
00:14:54,835 --> 00:14:57,116
And at the time, there was like Soldier of Fortune magazines and all this stuff.

250
00:14:57,136 --> 00:14:58,356
There was no real internet.

251
00:14:58,376 --> 00:14:59,177
We're talking pre-1995, before...

252
00:15:01,575 --> 00:15:03,896
Windows put browsers into the operating system.

253
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,238
So you couldn't just go Google it.

254
00:15:06,298 --> 00:15:07,398
You had to go find stuff.

255
00:15:07,418 --> 00:15:11,100
So they probably thought we were ready to go do some great

256
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,481
takeover of the government or something, because we had all

257
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:15,703
these subscriptions to magazines that would bring in

258
00:15:15,743 --> 00:15:17,044
all these new technologies.

259
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:20,046
And we're trying to really be fans of what's happening in

260
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,887
the world and what might be being done by the government.

261
00:15:21,907 --> 00:15:24,008
So Command & Conquer was always meant to be a near

262
00:15:24,428 --> 00:15:26,629
future version of the world.

263
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:29,471
And we're going to hear from Ed DelCastillo next, who is the

264
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:29,791
producer.

265
00:15:32,003 --> 00:15:39,666
I think my favorite memory revolves around those things that we did that were unexpected

266
00:15:39,686 --> 00:15:46,508
and unasked for that pushed that product above and beyond to be the success it was.

267
00:15:46,928 --> 00:15:53,630
So I'll give you one example of that and for me that's the mission briefings.

268
00:15:54,671 --> 00:15:59,873
So you know we were on a path of doing mission briefings that were going to be straight teletype

269
00:15:59,913 --> 00:16:00,373
you know just.

270
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:06,993
you know, just spitting text out slowly across the screen to tell people what they needed to do.

271
00:16:07,754 --> 00:16:14,538
And, you know, the team was so enthused about the game and was so in love with the game that

272
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:21,883
that just didn't seem like enough for us. And so we came up with this idea to kind of take,

273
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:27,347
at the time it was really early, but take television style graphics and put them on top of

274
00:16:27,867 --> 00:16:30,649
a video briefing to produce a

275
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:47,501
a briefing that was something people hadn't seen before, something that, you know, the story we had come up with was that there was this interactive panel between the player, who was this remote general commanding armed forces from afar,

276
00:16:48,182 --> 00:16:53,083
and the guy giving the briefing, be it Kane or be it General Shepard.

277
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:57,807
And that interactive screen could be touched by the briefing giver,

278
00:16:58,207 --> 00:17:00,490
could have graphics thrown up onto it,

279
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:04,093
could have all sorts of wonderful things done to it.

280
00:17:04,594 --> 00:17:07,657
And so one day we went into the studio,

281
00:17:08,297 --> 00:17:12,761
we just did this really, really, really bootleggy kind of demo.

282
00:17:13,022 --> 00:17:16,605
We did it on a weekend, so we weren't pulling away from company time.

283
00:17:17,025 --> 00:17:19,467
We edited the whole thing using Lightwave.

284
00:17:19,947 --> 00:17:23,490
And the guy I was doing with, Felix, was really good.

285
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,630
We had come from New Tech.

286
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,651
He knew Lightwave.

287
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:28,413
And we just kind of spent that whole weekend.

288
00:17:28,453 --> 00:17:29,493
I mean, we barely slept.

289
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:35,512
putting graphics onto a briefing and making it so that, you know, it was me doing the briefing,

290
00:17:35,532 --> 00:17:41,895
it was, I was throwing maps out onto a screen between the player and the briefing giver.

291
00:17:42,275 --> 00:17:46,197
We were showing, you know, I would open my hand and a world appeared in my hand.

292
00:17:46,517 --> 00:17:49,478
I pointed at the world and Angola got highlighted and zoomed out.

293
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:54,861
I mean, we did all of these really, really cool things and no one had asked that of us.

294
00:17:56,899 --> 00:18:03,883
One of my favorite memories from the first Command & Conquer was when the user interface worked as well as I had hoped.

295
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:10,587
The refinements and some of the additional changes that came as we kept perfecting it more and more and more.

296
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:20,133
You know, I would play the game and see the interface that Joe and some of the other guys had put together for me along the lines of what I was really, really hoping for.

297
00:18:20,173 --> 00:18:25,476
And then when it worked so well, finally, because it took a lot, a lot of iterations.

298
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:28,999
in the precursor to C&C and C&C itself,

299
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:31,099
that when it finally came together, you just had this...

300
00:18:31,459 --> 00:18:32,740
I had this great heartfelt...

301
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,080
Ah! This is it! Finally!

302
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,821
What it really, really wants to be.

303
00:18:37,841 --> 00:18:40,341
It was a lot of fun, and it was so elegant and smooth,

304
00:18:40,881 --> 00:18:43,862
and it allowed you to just play the game in a whole new way.

305
00:18:43,882 --> 00:18:47,342
In fact, you got to focus more on playing the game

306
00:18:47,762 --> 00:18:49,003
than in controlling the game,

307
00:18:49,143 --> 00:18:54,063
which was one of the DNA components of the C&C universe.

308
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:01,453
One of my favorite stories about Command and Conquer was actually about Joe Bostic.

309
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:09,058
A group of us had decided to go skiing and we were sitting, I think, at dinner and I looked over at him

310
00:19:09,138 --> 00:19:14,322
and he had this notebook out and he was working on something and I asked him,

311
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:17,303
what are you doing? And he said, oh, I'm working on Command and Conquer.

312
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:22,127
And I was just so struck by how dedicated and passionate.

313
00:19:22,688 --> 00:19:28,652
He was. Here we were trying to have a vacation and he was just living and breathing Command & Conquer.

314
00:19:28,672 --> 00:19:33,956
It was really like that for everybody on the team. It was truly an amazing experience.

315
00:19:37,017 --> 00:19:43,401
My favorite moment from Command & Conquer development was

316
00:19:44,802 --> 00:19:50,306
something I always just kind of remember was the way that we could all

317
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:53,761
provide input into the game experience and the development.

318
00:19:54,681 --> 00:19:58,124
I was a community guy, I was a customer service guy at the time.

319
00:19:59,325 --> 00:20:04,549
My input into the game wasn't as great as other people obviously,

320
00:20:04,649 --> 00:20:08,052
but the nice thing is that we all got to play in the evenings

321
00:20:08,232 --> 00:20:11,895
and we would play multiplayer and then we would all submit ideas into it and

322
00:20:11,935 --> 00:20:16,298
because the game team was so small we all had a

323
00:20:16,358 --> 00:20:19,881
really valuable voice into the game.

324
00:20:21,461 --> 00:20:23,421
things that I would suggest got in there,

325
00:20:23,441 --> 00:20:25,222
things that other people would suggest got in there,

326
00:20:25,262 --> 00:20:26,082
and it was very quick,

327
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,042
because we were such a small team at the time.

328
00:20:28,723 --> 00:20:31,463
So, you know, I would mention something to Joe Bostic,

329
00:20:31,503 --> 00:20:32,704
and then like an hour later, he said,

330
00:20:32,724 --> 00:20:34,264
okay, there's a new build, and your idea's in there.

331
00:20:34,284 --> 00:20:35,984
And it's like, oh, that's awesome, you know?

332
00:20:36,504 --> 00:20:41,386
And so, it was really fun to play even a small part

333
00:20:41,426 --> 00:20:43,846
in the development of the original Command & Conquer.

334
00:20:43,866 --> 00:20:49,007
It was just, it felt like a very small and dedicated team,

335
00:20:49,087 --> 00:20:50,168
and we were just so...

336
00:20:52,476 --> 00:20:58,498
involved in every way in making it better because we just loved it so much.

337
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:03,540
But it was people going above and beyond because they loved the product

338
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:08,422
and they really, really, really wanted it to be better than even expectation.

339
00:21:11,123 --> 00:21:17,885
My favorite memory was, I think it was Mike running into my office with one of the PC

340
00:21:18,105 --> 00:21:20,786
games magazines and it was awards.

341
00:21:22,165 --> 00:21:25,067
And Command & Conquer, of course, was nominated.

342
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:28,368
But in the corner was this little block

343
00:21:28,508 --> 00:21:30,729
that said we should have a special category

344
00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:34,030
for installations because this one was so awesome.

345
00:21:34,931 --> 00:21:37,572
And that just made me feel so good

346
00:21:37,932 --> 00:21:40,373
because somebody, the audience out there,

347
00:21:40,413 --> 00:21:43,174
the players appreciated all the effort that went into it.

348
00:21:43,214 --> 00:21:45,775
So that was a really good moment for me.

349
00:21:47,585 --> 00:21:52,913
One of the interesting things that CNC did was this idea of kind of telecaster broadcast interruption.

350
00:21:53,293 --> 00:21:57,539
We even did it during the installation of Command & Conquer, and that was really, really fun.

351
00:21:57,955 --> 00:22:02,559
where the gameplay actually began at a space that it normally didn't begin.

352
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:08,083
And the idea, of course, given the limits of technology and graphics,

353
00:22:08,563 --> 00:22:14,207
was, oh, there's this kind of interruption, like it's a signal, a video signal coming from somewhere.

354
00:22:14,227 --> 00:22:18,270
It's encrypted and it's actually breaking onto your game screen.

355
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:19,491
So that was really, really fun.

356
00:22:19,711 --> 00:22:24,194
And the idea of continuing to use cinematics and outtakes and things like that...

357
00:22:24,705 --> 00:22:30,089
just felt right. It made sense for the time and the place and the game and to create this

358
00:22:30,189 --> 00:22:37,353
this immersion, this larger-than-life sort of strange mythos that only you, the game player,

359
00:22:37,373 --> 00:22:41,796
you're being talked to directly. It's kind of like a secret agent commander sort of thing.

360
00:22:41,816 --> 00:22:49,901
It's a lot of fun. It started really with the art, because I would get all the art of what

361
00:22:49,941 --> 00:22:51,542
they wanted the whole thing to look like.

362
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:56,251
and then I had to have them break those animations down into pieces.

363
00:22:57,191 --> 00:23:01,893
Then I used the last image of each animation as my background,

364
00:23:02,494 --> 00:23:06,255
because some of them already had built-in where they wanted all the gadgets to be.

365
00:23:07,156 --> 00:23:13,939
So I had to basically do my gadgets on top of that background and fill it in.

366
00:23:13,979 --> 00:23:16,720
Sometimes they had invisible backgrounds, sometimes not,

367
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,021
just depending on what they wanted to do.

368
00:23:20,255 --> 00:23:24,718
That way we got through in pieces and sections.

369
00:23:24,758 --> 00:23:27,240
And as soon as that information was gathered,

370
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,021
we played the next animation

371
00:23:29,061 --> 00:23:31,143
and seamlessly go into the next sequence.

372
00:23:31,163 --> 00:23:35,226
So there's a lot of things that I won't remember,

373
00:23:36,587 --> 00:23:37,307
but I'll do my best.

374
00:23:37,427 --> 00:23:40,529
So in putting together the video sequences,

375
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:43,912
what I recall was that it was relatively piecemeal.

376
00:23:46,356 --> 00:23:48,977
Now, like, we made a lot of stuff up as we went along.

377
00:23:49,017 --> 00:23:51,458
There were things that were being written and then rewritten.

378
00:23:52,138 --> 00:23:55,999
I remember doing some writing myself on some of the monologues and some of the scenes

379
00:23:56,059 --> 00:24:03,182
because, you know, we had hired a screenwriter to come in who was completely unfamiliar with the genre.

380
00:24:03,222 --> 00:24:06,703
I guess as unfamiliar with the genre as any of us were because it was such a brand new genre.

381
00:24:07,243 --> 00:24:11,984
But I remember doing a lot of rewrites.

382
00:24:12,004 --> 00:24:14,665
I remember sort of doing a lot of things piecemeal.

383
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,361
We were in a smaller space at this point.

384
00:24:19,381 --> 00:24:21,861
Westwood was, we were growing,

385
00:24:21,921 --> 00:24:24,882
and we were soon to move to our larger space

386
00:24:25,002 --> 00:24:28,403
and the big 40 by 40 green screen

387
00:24:28,443 --> 00:24:30,164
and then the back lot and the soundstages that we had.

388
00:24:30,924 --> 00:24:31,744
But that hadn't happened yet.

389
00:24:32,184 --> 00:24:35,805
So what we had done is we had rented another space

390
00:24:36,105 --> 00:24:39,526
in the same complex, but it was a quarter of a mile away

391
00:24:39,566 --> 00:24:42,007
across three parking lots and upstairs.

392
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:46,830
So when it was time to record, we'd go over to the studio,

393
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:49,611
and we'd hike ourselves over there,

394
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:51,532
and everything was upstairs.

395
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,232
Now, all of these were shot with a,

396
00:24:53,632 --> 00:24:57,053
well, like this, on sticks with a dead-hung camera.

397
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:00,054
But any sort of movement across the stage,

398
00:25:00,094 --> 00:25:02,974
we were sort of bouncing on a suspended floor.

399
00:25:05,612 --> 00:25:09,992
Like, it feels very primitive in recollection.

400
00:25:10,052 --> 00:25:12,113
And I don't think it felt that way at the time.

401
00:25:12,133 --> 00:25:16,074
I think it felt very new and, you know,

402
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:21,115
avant-garde and exciting and envelope crushing

403
00:25:21,155 --> 00:25:22,535
and brave new world, envelope pushing

404
00:25:22,575 --> 00:25:23,595
and brave new world and all that.

405
00:25:25,596 --> 00:25:27,496
When we first started out with our videos,

406
00:25:28,016 --> 00:25:31,477
it was so seat of the pants, it was kind of hilarious.

407
00:25:32,177 --> 00:25:33,237
I don't know if you remember, but we-

408
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:45,822
warehouse and I had gone to a carpet store and bought a roll of linoleum

409
00:25:45,922 --> 00:25:52,203
flooring, brought that back and we stapled that to the wall and we didn't

410
00:25:52,223 --> 00:25:55,204
even have chroma key paint. I just went to our hardware store and said,

411
00:25:55,224 --> 00:26:01,426
I need some green paint. And then painted that and that was our first green screen.

412
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,736
So Eric, why don't you tell us a little bit about the design process of CNC.

413
00:26:10,057 --> 00:26:14,525
How did we work, how did you guys work with the technical team and how did you come up with the missions and,

414
00:26:15,026 --> 00:26:17,530
and the, you know, deal with the AI and all those things?

415
00:26:18,732 --> 00:26:19,514
I think, um.

416
00:26:19,949 --> 00:26:22,570
For me, it was probably one of the most collaborative games I've ever worked on.

417
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:26,291
As other people noted, the tech team was really approachable.

418
00:26:26,391 --> 00:26:29,612
So you could walk into Joe's office or talk to Steve and go, I've got this idea.

419
00:26:29,652 --> 00:26:33,973
They'd look at you cross-eyed and say, we'll figure it out.

420
00:26:34,313 --> 00:26:35,873
And inevitably, they would.

421
00:26:36,113 --> 00:26:40,254
And one of the really great things was you could ask Joe for something, and

422
00:26:40,274 --> 00:26:42,835
you'd get it really quick, and it would be like 90%

423
00:26:44,461 --> 00:26:48,423
right. You know, there wasn't this high iteration back and forth where you had to go,

424
00:26:48,443 --> 00:26:52,964
well, it's not really what I wanted and this and that. And he'd add his stuff on top of that.

425
00:26:53,004 --> 00:26:58,726
So you'd get this really great collaboration of pieces parts. So that process was really

426
00:26:58,766 --> 00:27:02,988
seamless and it wasn't necessarily by design. It was just, we had such a good group of people

427
00:27:03,048 --> 00:27:05,649
that worked really well together. And it.

428
00:27:06,045 --> 00:27:08,467
The whole process felt like lightning had kind of struck.

429
00:27:08,487 --> 00:27:11,049
You know, we had the right people working on the right product at the right time.

430
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:12,910
And it just felt good.

431
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:16,153
I don't remember any of the process being by design.

432
00:27:16,353 --> 00:27:19,295
It was just a group of people that had an idea and wanted to make it work.

433
00:27:19,695 --> 00:27:24,058
And as others have noted, we did a lot of stuff just unasked for

434
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:25,680
and just because it sounded cool at the time.

435
00:27:27,622 --> 00:27:36,582
Thanks. And so Steve, why don't you tell us a little bit about your favorite memories and maybe some of the technical challenges and things that you guys might have run into?

436
00:27:37,115 --> 00:27:40,477
Yeah, so favorite memory for me is around the multiplayer.

437
00:27:41,377 --> 00:27:43,778
And, you know, many people over the years have told me

438
00:27:44,298 --> 00:27:46,579
that they played Command & Conquer in their dorm room.

439
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:49,580
And it's always great to hear that.

440
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,741
And I think there was a sort of a viral aspect to that too,

441
00:27:52,801 --> 00:27:54,242
because there were two discs for the game.

442
00:27:54,262 --> 00:27:55,923
You had the Nod disc and GDI disc.

443
00:27:56,403 --> 00:27:58,363
So you could play with a friend with one copy of the game.

444
00:27:58,383 --> 00:27:59,724
And I think that actually benefited us.

445
00:28:00,568 --> 00:28:03,550
But the thing about it is, as a player,

446
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:06,471
you don't see how the game is created.

447
00:28:06,491 --> 00:28:09,152
The multiplayer obviously was evolved over time.

448
00:28:10,152 --> 00:28:14,634
And so for me, I remember the very first time

449
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:15,795
you could play multiplayer.

450
00:28:16,635 --> 00:28:19,596
And the only thing you could build were rocket soldiers.

451
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:20,937
That was the only thing you could build.

452
00:28:21,657 --> 00:28:23,978
And so you've got four guys who jump in.

453
00:28:24,018 --> 00:28:26,059
You'd all build your horde of rocket guys,

454
00:28:26,499 --> 00:28:28,700
send them over to the other guy's horde of rocket guys,

455
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,620
and try and win.

456
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:29,980
It was very.

457
00:28:30,701 --> 00:28:32,302
very primitive, but it was the

458
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:36,466
The baseline for the tech and send that over the coming

459
00:28:37,247 --> 00:28:42,492
Days and weeks after that we'd add more and more units the buildings the tech tree all got into the game

460
00:28:43,193 --> 00:28:46,376
and so the memory for me is sort of a

461
00:28:46,897 --> 00:28:48,458
realization moment that

462
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:54,605
You know every night after work basically the whole company was staying behind to play multiplayer

463
00:28:55,512 --> 00:28:57,353
And there's tons of excitement in the office,

464
00:28:57,373 --> 00:28:59,614
you know, what new unit got added to the game,

465
00:28:59,634 --> 00:29:01,235
that's in the commandos in the game today,

466
00:29:01,255 --> 00:29:02,936
you can blow buildings up, you know, that kind of stuff.

467
00:29:03,816 --> 00:29:07,438
And lots of excitement using the company phone system

468
00:29:07,478 --> 00:29:09,699
intercom for the real time communications.

469
00:29:09,719 --> 00:29:11,520
So, you know, you're gonna form an alliance

470
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,021
with your friend and get the other guys,

471
00:29:13,061 --> 00:29:13,822
all this kind of stuff.

472
00:29:14,262 --> 00:29:16,623
And the realization was, wow, we're actually building

473
00:29:16,663 --> 00:29:18,104
something that's pretty freaking special.

474
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:20,045
And it kind of hit me at that point,

475
00:29:20,585 --> 00:29:23,546
that, wow, we've got something very unique on our hands.

476
00:29:24,589 --> 00:29:25,670
So that's my favorite memory.

477
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:30,273
In terms of technical challenges, there were a lot.

478
00:29:30,293 --> 00:29:32,195
You know, there was multiplayer, I talked about that.

479
00:29:33,315 --> 00:29:34,817
But I think the thing that stands out

480
00:29:35,097 --> 00:29:38,439
is the sort of computation limits that we ran into.

481
00:29:39,495 --> 00:29:40,556
And I'll explain what I mean.

482
00:29:40,656 --> 00:29:43,538
So I think there were three components of that.

483
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,981
The first one is all of the 3D animations

484
00:29:47,081 --> 00:29:49,824
that became like a signature part of the game.

485
00:29:49,884 --> 00:29:51,825
All of the mission briefings, all the tanks and planes,

486
00:29:51,885 --> 00:29:52,886
all this action going on.

487
00:29:53,587 --> 00:29:55,408
And of course, the artists wanted to render out

488
00:29:55,448 --> 00:29:57,250
these animations, and it was prohibitive.

489
00:29:57,971 --> 00:30:01,834
It took hours to render seconds of animation.

490
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,917
And so at the time, Autodesk came out

491
00:30:04,977 --> 00:30:06,958
with their network render.

492
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,682
functionality so you could have a farm of machines which we did so we set up

493
00:30:13,602 --> 00:30:17,504
10 20 30 40 machines in racks and it got bigger over time I think we got up to

494
00:30:17,925 --> 00:30:21,667
over 100 machines eventually and we started out with these machines and so

495
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:25,989
the artists could then submit their animation jobs and get reasonable

496
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:30,412
turnaround times so so the compute cost in that respect was solved

497
00:30:31,677 --> 00:30:33,378
But the next problem was, of course,

498
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:35,760
we have all this live action, and we're

499
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,363
going to do this compositing with the 3D videos.

500
00:30:39,603 --> 00:30:41,625
And we have all this video we have to play in the game.

501
00:30:42,186 --> 00:30:44,087
So we came up with our own, as Lewis mentioned,

502
00:30:44,147 --> 00:30:45,508
we built our own video tech.

503
00:30:46,029 --> 00:30:47,970
So the real-time part of that was fine.

504
00:30:48,571 --> 00:30:50,292
We could play back at a reasonable frame rate,

505
00:30:51,013 --> 00:30:52,775
glorious 15 frames per second, 320, 200,

506
00:30:53,635 --> 00:30:55,357
which was fine for the time.

507
00:30:56,278 --> 00:30:57,098
And it fit on a CD.

508
00:30:58,178 --> 00:31:00,260
But again, the compression times were crazy.

509
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,262
It would take hours and hours to render

510
00:31:02,302 --> 00:31:03,242
a couple of minutes of video.

511
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:07,526
So one of the lead engineers at the time, Bill Randolph,

512
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:09,868
said, hey, I think I can fix this.

513
00:31:10,709 --> 00:31:12,731
And so he spent some time, and he came up with a way

514
00:31:13,231 --> 00:31:16,494
of using the render farm to batch out the video

515
00:31:16,514 --> 00:31:16,895
compression.

516
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:21,725
So we had these machines, and we could use them for the 3D rendering,

517
00:31:21,785 --> 00:31:23,466
we could use them for the video compression.

518
00:31:23,987 --> 00:31:26,248
But of course, the artists wanted to render their movies,

519
00:31:26,308 --> 00:31:30,951
and we wanted to also, the video guys wanted to compress their movies.

520
00:31:31,892 --> 00:31:33,033
And there weren't enough machines.

521
00:31:33,833 --> 00:31:36,215
So to solve that, we came up with a policy.

522
00:31:36,855 --> 00:31:39,977
We basically realized that when people went home in the evenings,

523
00:31:40,117 --> 00:31:41,538
there was a machine sitting there doing nothing.

524
00:31:42,238 --> 00:31:44,380
So we came up with this policy where when you left for the day,

525
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,401
you ran your machine in VQ slave mode.

526
00:31:46,901 --> 00:31:48,862
So we went from 50 machines to 100 machines.

527
00:31:49,643 --> 00:31:52,824
And we were able to get decent turnaround time on the movies that way.

528
00:31:54,885 --> 00:31:59,348
So the third thing, though, we sort of ran into code complexity issues.

529
00:31:59,408 --> 00:32:00,368
So we were using C++.

530
00:32:00,388 --> 00:32:04,271
We were learning C++ and using every feature the language has.

531
00:32:04,951 --> 00:32:06,932
And so the build time started to increase.

532
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:09,353
And we were talking about an hour plus build time,

533
00:32:09,373 --> 00:32:10,374
which was crazy for us.

534
00:32:11,753 --> 00:32:14,057
So again, Bill Randolph, I think it was, said,

535
00:32:14,097 --> 00:32:15,338
hey, I think I can fix this.

536
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,864
And he came out with a way of using the render farm

537
00:32:18,924 --> 00:32:21,708
and the slave machines to do distributed builds.

538
00:32:22,329 --> 00:32:24,272
So we got the build times, we could build in parallel,

539
00:32:24,292 --> 00:32:27,377
and it brought the build times down dramatically.

540
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,871
And a sort of interesting footnote to that,

541
00:32:29,911 --> 00:32:32,773
I was talking to the Petroglyph Games guys the other night,

542
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:34,874
and you guys may have heard they're doing the

543
00:32:35,355 --> 00:32:36,616
CNC HD remasters.

544
00:32:37,776 --> 00:32:39,538
And so it's come full circle.

545
00:32:39,978 --> 00:32:44,461
Petroglyph is basically the sort of

546
00:32:44,521 --> 00:32:46,102
continuation of Westwood, I guess the co-founders

547
00:32:46,162 --> 00:32:48,444
of Petroglyph are from Westwood, Mike, Joe, and Steve.

548
00:32:49,144 --> 00:32:50,605
And I was talking to Steve and I said, you know,

549
00:32:50,765 --> 00:32:52,867
I'm going to be talking about the build time problems we had.

550
00:32:53,267 --> 00:32:55,668
And he said, oh yeah, we're working with the original

551
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,969
CNC source code.

552
00:32:57,774 --> 00:33:00,782
And it takes five seconds to build.

553
00:33:00,802 --> 00:33:06,616
So I guess that's 25 years we'll do that, right?

554
00:33:09,209 --> 00:33:09,690
That's awesome.

555
00:33:11,011 --> 00:33:12,232
Just a bit off script here, too.

556
00:33:12,252 --> 00:33:13,112
The thing was really funny.

557
00:33:13,152 --> 00:33:16,155
Eventually we had hundreds of these Pentium 90s in racks,

558
00:33:16,195 --> 00:33:17,316
gorilla racks all lined up.

559
00:33:17,876 --> 00:33:20,138
And they were sitting in an area that was kind of a

560
00:33:20,158 --> 00:33:20,519
common area.

561
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:23,321
And what was happening was we got toward the, it was fine in

562
00:33:23,341 --> 00:33:25,243
the winter in Vegas, but it was starting to get toward the

563
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:28,766
summer, these are basically little BTU farms.

564
00:33:28,826 --> 00:33:30,928
And they were driving the heat up in the building.

565
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:33,029
We were like, we were basically cooking ourselves

566
00:33:33,069 --> 00:33:33,830
with our computers.

567
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:39,372
And so we created our own zero pressure room by taking a small room, closing it all off,

568
00:33:39,412 --> 00:33:43,813
having a big air conditioning unit added to the roof, it was like a 15 ton air conditioning

569
00:33:43,873 --> 00:33:47,975
unit and having only little slits at the door, at the bottom of the door with a brush was

570
00:33:47,995 --> 00:33:51,436
the only way for the air to get out so you would actually open the door and you'd feel

571
00:33:51,456 --> 00:33:51,816
a pop.

572
00:33:52,956 --> 00:33:55,277
And that cold air would come in and cool off the whole room.

573
00:33:55,297 --> 00:33:57,677
And it had no return air, Mike Ligg, no return air.

574
00:33:58,177 --> 00:34:02,158
So anyways, we have a little bit more from Brett.

575
00:34:02,198 --> 00:34:03,399
We all played every single night.

576
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:05,539
And as you can imagine, probably you've already got a

577
00:34:05,579 --> 00:34:06,759
sense of Brett's personality.

578
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,140
So I wanted to conclude this little clip here because he

579
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,841
talked a little bit about his play sessions at night.

580
00:34:13,371 --> 00:34:18,315
I know it sounds like bragging, but I could beat almost anybody, head to head, playing any side, any time.

581
00:34:19,336 --> 00:34:22,258
Every time there would be this argument, because I had this big...

582
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:28,263
I had these strong feelings about what makes a game balanced and what made our game really, really balanced and fair.

583
00:34:28,323 --> 00:34:30,305
And so every now and then somebody would challenge me and say,

584
00:34:30,745 --> 00:34:35,209
Hey, you know, Nod is stronger than GDI, or this unit's better than that.

585
00:34:35,349 --> 00:34:36,290
And I said, No, you're just...

586
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,272
You're not taking the unit until merits, and watch.

587
00:34:39,292 --> 00:34:40,954
And we'd just play head to head, and so we would.

588
00:34:43,774 --> 00:34:45,115
I used to be Overlord.

589
00:34:46,935 --> 00:34:48,716
I think it's Brett's very Overlord, yeah.

590
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,297
Yeah, his memory's a little fuzzy, I think.

591
00:34:50,377 --> 00:34:51,237
It might be a little fuzzy.

592
00:34:52,678 --> 00:34:57,160
Brett does have his own version of reality that is very, very cool.

593
00:35:00,563 --> 00:35:04,746
So Steve, why don't you tell us a little bit about the technical challenges that you, Joe,

594
00:35:04,766 --> 00:35:05,627
and the team faced.

595
00:35:06,628 --> 00:35:07,408
I think there was actually two of them.

596
00:35:07,428 --> 00:35:10,331
There's the networking stuff, because there were multiple networking layers, and then

597
00:35:10,351 --> 00:35:11,372
there was pathfinding stuff.

598
00:35:11,552 --> 00:35:13,193
Yeah, the networking was interesting.

599
00:35:13,213 --> 00:35:18,697
It was pre-internet, so we had local area network play with IPX.

600
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:21,940
Then we supported modem and non-modem connections.

601
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:26,183
So the latency and bandwidth characteristics of those are very different.

602
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:28,625
And we would add a bunch of stuff.

603
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,581
that worked great in the local area network

604
00:35:32,601 --> 00:35:34,522
and then poor Dave Detmer was doing

605
00:35:34,542 --> 00:35:35,902
the modem connection stuff.

606
00:35:35,922 --> 00:35:38,503
He's like, there's too much data, it will never work.

607
00:35:39,123 --> 00:35:41,184
Yeah, so we spent a lot of time with

608
00:35:41,744 --> 00:35:43,324
trying to figure out ways of minimizing

609
00:35:43,544 --> 00:35:45,925
the amount of stuff that was sent over the wire.

610
00:35:46,725 --> 00:35:48,726
And unfortunately, one of the things

611
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:49,966
that we didn't get into the game

612
00:35:50,006 --> 00:35:51,967
that we wanted to get into the game was internet play.

613
00:35:52,787 --> 00:35:55,868
But that would follow in Red Alert, we figured that out.

614
00:35:56,801 --> 00:35:59,603
So, yeah, some interesting challenges there with the networking.

615
00:36:00,223 --> 00:36:03,405
And the pathfinding stuff, it was actually, it was a challenge.

616
00:36:04,646 --> 00:36:05,706
I was generally pretty pleased.

617
00:36:05,726 --> 00:36:08,368
I mean, you could select, you know, 50, 100 units,

618
00:36:08,388 --> 00:36:12,531
and they behaved in a pretty solid manner,

619
00:36:12,731 --> 00:36:14,112
and would path around each other,

620
00:36:14,152 --> 00:36:18,054
and there were no practical limits on how many units you could select,

621
00:36:18,074 --> 00:36:20,015
and they would behave predictably.

622
00:36:21,034 --> 00:36:26,797
Except maybe for the harvesters, which sometimes had a mind of their own.

623
00:36:28,277 --> 00:36:34,300
Me and Steve Weatherill and Jonathan Lanier were pulling an all-nighter trying to find a bug.

624
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:40,342
And we left the office around 2am to go get donuts to try and keep us awake,

625
00:36:40,642 --> 00:36:42,843
because we thought donuts would keep us awake, I guess.

626
00:36:43,663 --> 00:36:46,304
And I had this car that I inherited from my dad.

627
00:36:46,324 --> 00:36:48,605
It was a really hideous car, but it was the car I drove.

628
00:36:49,043 --> 00:36:52,285
So we hopped into the station wagon and drove to the donut place and it was 2 a.m.

629
00:36:52,345 --> 00:36:57,890
And we were leaving and I got lost in the parking lot and I couldn't find the way out.

630
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:02,213
And so one of the guys says, where are you, a harvester driver?

631
00:37:02,233 --> 00:37:05,355
And from that moment on, that car became known as the harvester.

632
00:37:07,257 --> 00:37:10,219
How did the cast of C&C get assembled?

633
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,241
So casting was.

634
00:37:14,703 --> 00:37:16,924
Kind of a challenge, you know, I come from a.

635
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:22,985
theatrical background. My, my, the entirety of my career was spent either in

636
00:37:23,025 --> 00:37:29,847
teaching or directing in theater in Las Vegas. And so I had some access to

637
00:37:31,488 --> 00:37:36,289
actors, but a great many of them were community theater actors. They were

638
00:37:36,309 --> 00:37:39,910
hobbyists, people that were bankers during the day and actors at night. So

639
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:43,992
sort of reaching out into the professional acting community of Las

640
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:44,372
Vegas.

641
00:37:45,992 --> 00:37:50,994
another brave new world for me. So I talked to the talent agencies in town

642
00:37:51,014 --> 00:37:54,356
that I was familiar with and we set up auditions and we started bringing people

643
00:37:54,416 --> 00:37:58,198
in and we found pretty quickly that you know we we started getting access to

644
00:37:58,578 --> 00:38:02,700
some of the performers on the strip that were looking to expand and do some

645
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,923
things. Eric, I can't remember Eric's last name, played

646
00:38:07,003 --> 00:38:11,785
Shepard. He was actually a one of the Blues Brothers impersonators back in the

647
00:38:11,825 --> 00:38:12,225
day when

648
00:38:12,715 --> 00:38:15,197
Imperial Palace was doing impersonator shows.

649
00:38:15,597 --> 00:38:17,698
So he came from that call.

650
00:38:19,259 --> 00:38:21,740
A lot of the performers were people that I knew.

651
00:38:22,721 --> 00:38:24,402
And truth be told, a lot of the performers

652
00:38:24,462 --> 00:38:26,603
were people that were in or around Westwood at the time,

653
00:38:26,623 --> 00:38:30,425
because it was just easier to snag somebody

654
00:38:30,505 --> 00:38:31,625
once a script had been finished,

655
00:38:32,186 --> 00:38:34,227
and bring them over to the studio

656
00:38:34,267 --> 00:38:35,667
for a quick recording session.

657
00:38:37,388 --> 00:38:39,710
Joe Coogan was in my office one day.

658
00:38:40,815 --> 00:38:43,217
And we were talking about some shots that were coming up,

659
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:46,098
because we rendered our own background plates.

660
00:38:46,838 --> 00:38:48,399
And then after we shot green screen,

661
00:38:48,419 --> 00:38:50,180
we dropped that footage into those plates.

662
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,520
So we're talking about some plates.

663
00:38:52,201 --> 00:38:56,423
And Joe said something like, and that's when we see Seth.

664
00:38:56,963 --> 00:38:58,264
And then he stops all of a sudden.

665
00:38:58,284 --> 00:38:59,084
He's like, oh, crap.

666
00:38:59,104 --> 00:39:00,325
I'm like, what?

667
00:39:00,345 --> 00:39:02,246
He said, we forgot to cast Seth.

668
00:39:03,246 --> 00:39:04,106
And I'm like, who's Seth?

669
00:39:05,786 --> 00:39:07,666
And he looks at me and goes, you could be Seth.

670
00:39:07,686 --> 00:39:08,747
Do you want to be Seth?

671
00:39:09,287 --> 00:39:11,707
So I said, yeah, sure.

672
00:39:11,827 --> 00:39:13,508
So that's how Seth started.

673
00:39:15,008 --> 00:39:17,069
Well, I was working at Westwood at the time.

674
00:39:17,149 --> 00:39:20,550
I believe I had been the receptionist for a while.

675
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:25,271
And so my voice was on all the away messages

676
00:39:25,411 --> 00:39:28,171
and voicemail messages for Westwood.

677
00:39:28,812 --> 00:39:31,592
And one day, Paul Mudra came to me

678
00:39:31,672 --> 00:39:33,653
and asked me to record some.

679
00:39:34,393 --> 00:39:41,116
holder lines, place lines for command and conquer. And we went into this little tiny room basically,

680
00:39:41,196 --> 00:39:47,558
it was I think a closet that he had put up a whole bunch of soundproofing. And he had me read the

681
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:54,681
lines from there. And so I did. And I think the team, you know, liked what I had done. And so

682
00:39:54,801 --> 00:39:57,202
they decided that they wanted to use me going forward.

683
00:39:57,663 --> 00:40:02,804
So a lot of other people at Westwood had done various voices for the game.

684
00:40:02,824 --> 00:40:07,726
I was super excited. It was my first time doing something like that.

685
00:40:07,926 --> 00:40:13,848
And I was just tickled pink that he liked what I had done and that they wanted me to do even more.

686
00:40:13,988 --> 00:40:16,148
So I was super, super happy.

687
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:20,130
Yeah, and it was the closet. It was the janitor's closet that used to be attached to the

688
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:24,051
bathrooms, which we turned into our server farm, which we later got sued for.

689
00:40:27,911 --> 00:40:29,932
And we'd shave the orangutan down.

690
00:40:30,693 --> 00:40:32,775
And we'd put the orangutan in front of the camera.

691
00:40:32,795 --> 00:40:37,258
And we'd hang, we'd put a whiteboard with the cane lines over the orangutan.

692
00:40:37,879 --> 00:40:41,001
And so that, you know, we would change, wipe them off and change every line.

693
00:40:41,942 --> 00:40:45,745
But when we put, when we compressed all that down into the game...

694
00:40:47,508 --> 00:40:48,888
You couldn't read the lines at all.

695
00:40:49,389 --> 00:40:50,729
The orangutan was great, don't get me wrong.

696
00:40:50,889 --> 00:40:53,410
Everyone loved the orangutan.

697
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:56,711
I think his name was Sparky or, yeah, Sparky.

698
00:40:58,652 --> 00:40:59,672
Anyway, everyone loved the orangutan,

699
00:41:00,352 --> 00:41:01,333
but we couldn't read his lines,

700
00:41:01,453 --> 00:41:05,714
so I went in and I dubbed all of the orangutan's lines,

701
00:41:06,354 --> 00:41:09,736
and we had a guy in a green screen glove

702
00:41:09,796 --> 00:41:11,896
come in and move the orangutan's mouth like this,

703
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:14,397
just move his lips, while I would say the lines.

704
00:41:14,838 --> 00:41:17,880
And then we took out, of course, the green screen glove.

705
00:41:19,201 --> 00:41:20,842
But that wasn't very convincing either.

706
00:41:20,862 --> 00:41:21,983
So finally we looked around and we said,

707
00:41:22,023 --> 00:41:23,845
who looks the most like a shaved orangutan?

708
00:41:24,745 --> 00:41:26,246
And it was me.

709
00:41:26,426 --> 00:41:30,129
So I mean, because of my,

710
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:31,610
if you look at the original game,

711
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:32,351
a lot of people don't know this.

712
00:41:32,391 --> 00:41:33,532
If you look at the original game,

713
00:41:33,872 --> 00:41:34,933
a lot of those sequences,

714
00:41:35,533 --> 00:41:37,555
we have used some of the frames of the orangutan

715
00:41:37,635 --> 00:41:39,536
and just switched me out really quickly.

716
00:41:39,836 --> 00:41:41,618
And it's nearly impossible to tell the difference.

717
00:41:41,638 --> 00:41:42,358
It was really, really weird.

718
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:48,500
Remind us what it was like to work on C&C.

719
00:41:50,501 --> 00:41:52,562
Actually, I'm really, really, really demanding.

720
00:41:52,762 --> 00:41:54,983
And I'm in everybody's little details.

721
00:41:55,063 --> 00:41:57,424
And I'm very, very specific about what I want.

722
00:41:57,504 --> 00:42:02,066
So it can be, at times, a little bit challenging.

723
00:42:03,067 --> 00:42:04,047
But you know what?

724
00:42:04,547 --> 00:42:07,408
In the end, that's how we got to create

725
00:42:07,448 --> 00:42:09,249
this amazing, amazing game.

726
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,190
The meetings where we would all get together

727
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,291
with bread at the end of the table.

728
00:42:15,587 --> 00:42:21,830
Yeah, you know, we used to, some of us used to call those the Savannah Meeting,

729
00:42:22,771 --> 00:42:29,574
because the way we would say it is there was this hungry lion who would come into the room,

730
00:42:30,575 --> 00:42:32,916
and he was always looking for the slowest moving gazelle.

731
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:40,680
And it was everybody's job not to be the slowest moving gazelle, because the lion was going to eat.

732
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:45,621
no matter what which day it was, what meeting it was, the lion was going to eat.

733
00:42:46,101 --> 00:42:48,042
It was just a matter of who he was going to eat.

734
00:42:50,623 --> 00:42:57,845
The dinosaur levels came about through this odd way where Joe Bostic introduced a little bit of

735
00:42:57,905 --> 00:43:03,627
code and there was a little bit of art for a couple of dinosaurs. And I learned about it when

736
00:43:03,767 --> 00:43:06,608
I stumbled across this in the code and I asked him about it.

737
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:14,516
And he told me, yeah, this is a little Easter egg we're putting in, but Brett Sparrow, he doesn't know, so you can't tell him.

738
00:43:14,776 --> 00:43:15,476
So I said, okay.

739
00:43:16,737 --> 00:43:23,503
But then the art guys made a big art plate for the sidebar that was an homage to the Jurassic Park logo.

740
00:43:24,304 --> 00:43:25,785
And they made more dinosaurs.

741
00:43:26,626 --> 00:43:29,128
And then the sound guys got involved and made sounds.

742
00:43:29,809 --> 00:43:32,831
And then the video guys got involved and made a whole video.

743
00:43:33,672 --> 00:43:35,894
And at this point, Joe and I realized...

744
00:43:36,591 --> 00:43:37,951
Brett still didn't know about this.

745
00:43:38,112 --> 00:43:41,473
And when he found out, we didn't know what was gonna happen.

746
00:43:42,033 --> 00:43:45,754
And we were both really scared about what was gonna happen

747
00:43:45,794 --> 00:43:48,656
because we were ending up using company resources

748
00:43:49,296 --> 00:43:51,056
on this dumb little toy.

749
00:43:51,377 --> 00:43:56,779
So one day in QA, a bug caused that sidebar art to reveal.

750
00:43:57,519 --> 00:43:59,800
And suddenly the sidebar became a big dinosaur head

751
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,120
and Brett was there when it happened.

752
00:44:02,341 --> 00:44:04,482
So he and some QA guys showed up in our office.

753
00:44:05,295 --> 00:44:06,436
And he was pretty mad.

754
00:44:06,596 --> 00:44:09,079
He pulled Joe into his office and they closed the door.

755
00:44:09,339 --> 00:44:10,800
And I don't know what all was said,

756
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:13,402
but when Joe came out, he looked pretty shaken.

757
00:44:13,422 --> 00:44:15,804
And I said, Joe, what happened?

758
00:44:16,305 --> 00:44:17,426
And Joe said, we're pulling it all out.

759
00:44:17,546 --> 00:44:18,286
We're taking it all out.

760
00:44:18,326 --> 00:44:18,927
It's just gone.

761
00:44:19,167 --> 00:44:19,527
It's over.

762
00:44:19,547 --> 00:44:20,588
I'm like, what?

763
00:44:21,869 --> 00:44:24,111
And so we gave Brett some time to cool off.

764
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:26,913
And I went into his office, I think in the next day or two,

765
00:44:27,194 --> 00:44:28,835
and I begged him to keep this stuff.

766
00:44:29,656 --> 00:44:30,677
I just pleaded with him.

767
00:44:30,777 --> 00:44:31,818
And he basically said, okay,

768
00:44:31,858 --> 00:44:33,439
but you have to do it all yourself.

769
00:44:33,929 --> 00:44:36,911
and you have to do it all in your spare time, you cannot impact the game with this."

770
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,551
I said, okay.

771
00:44:41,294 --> 00:44:43,435
And, you know, Command & Conquer, I didn't know it at the time,

772
00:44:43,455 --> 00:44:47,677
we were creating such a big and amazing game,

773
00:44:48,438 --> 00:44:54,101
I had no idea how much it would move the needle in game development itself,

774
00:44:54,862 --> 00:44:58,684
and how many people would, quite liberally, directly,

775
00:44:59,302 --> 00:45:02,624
take and copy elements of our interface, our gameplay, etc.

776
00:45:02,684 --> 00:45:09,328
But it created this huge wave of other games and admirers and things like that.

777
00:45:09,488 --> 00:45:11,169
And so that was a form of...

778
00:45:11,189 --> 00:45:16,112
It was a little frustrating sometimes when the copying was so direct.

779
00:45:16,473 --> 00:45:20,275
And then other times it was very, very flattering to see that people were building on our work.

780
00:45:20,335 --> 00:45:23,717
And sometimes even taking it to the next level a little bit.

781
00:45:25,398 --> 00:45:28,500
One of the things I'd really love to leave people with is the idea

782
00:45:29,376 --> 00:45:35,240
that just because something's hard or just because you don't like the way something's going

783
00:45:36,481 --> 00:45:42,346
doesn't mean you can't learn anything from it and that you won't become better for it.

784
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:50,372
You know, there were a lot of unforgiving days in CNC. There were a lot of days when I walked home

785
00:45:51,052 --> 00:45:55,155
feeling incredibly defeated, like I did not accomplish what I was supposed to.

786
00:45:55,664 --> 00:45:57,285
for any number of reasons, right?

787
00:45:57,465 --> 00:45:59,606
Whether my boss was saying that or I was feeling that,

788
00:45:59,646 --> 00:46:00,346
it doesn't even matter.

789
00:46:00,987 --> 00:46:02,848
But I would go home feeling defeated.

790
00:46:03,788 --> 00:46:09,051
And what pulled me through that was not quitting,

791
00:46:09,131 --> 00:46:12,393
was just the idea that I'm gonna stick this through

792
00:46:12,493 --> 00:46:16,195
and rather than having the situation dictate me,

793
00:46:16,895 --> 00:46:18,436
I'm gonna dictate that situation.

794
00:46:18,536 --> 00:46:20,697
I'm gonna learn and I'm gonna be better.

795
00:46:21,177 --> 00:46:23,838
And I can say today that I have never had

796
00:46:24,413 --> 00:46:28,139
a more challenging time than when I was at Westwood.

797
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:35,631
And I can also say today that I never learned more from any institution than when I was

798
00:46:35,671 --> 00:46:36,092
at Westwood.

799
00:46:37,882 --> 00:46:40,105
It had everything that I wanted.

800
00:46:40,125 --> 00:46:43,390
It met every goal that I wanted to set out.

801
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:44,251
It was fun to play.

802
00:46:44,271 --> 00:46:45,232
It had a lot to replay.

803
00:46:45,252 --> 00:46:46,854
It was balanced really, really well.

804
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,196
I like the graphics.

805
00:46:48,276 --> 00:46:49,197
I like the effects.

806
00:46:49,498 --> 00:46:50,699
I like the story.

807
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,943
It came together beyond my wildest imagination.

808
00:46:54,164 --> 00:46:55,846
So it was incredible.

809
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:01,111
So that's the end of the material we have.

810
00:47:01,131 --> 00:47:04,011
We're going to move to Q&A. But before we do, give me a

811
00:47:04,151 --> 00:47:05,832
round of applause for all the people that worked on

812
00:47:05,852 --> 00:47:06,532
Command & Conquer.

813
00:47:06,552 --> 00:47:07,612
So they hear this.

814
00:47:24,156 --> 00:47:24,437
Thank you.

815
00:47:26,691 --> 00:47:30,533
As a good advisory board member, I always like to leave a little bit of time for questions.

816
00:47:30,993 --> 00:47:35,535
So we have about five minutes because there's a special thing we want to close with just

817
00:47:35,595 --> 00:47:36,315
before the end.

818
00:47:36,835 --> 00:47:39,537
So if there are any questions, there are microphones.

819
00:47:39,577 --> 00:47:41,478
Some people have already figured out they can stand up to them.

820
00:47:42,038 --> 00:47:45,319
And we'll be happy to answer those to the best of our ability.

821
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:49,221
Thankfully, we don't have to worry about lawsuits anymore, so we can be pretty candid.

822
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:55,933
Hi, I just wanted to say to Frank your song Mechanical Man is incredible.

823
00:47:57,554 --> 00:48:03,618
As you may know, World of Warcraft released a take or riff on that song, I'm a Medieval

824
00:48:03,638 --> 00:48:05,239
Man, which was a lot of fun.

825
00:48:05,259 --> 00:48:09,642
I wanted to know what you thought of that and are you planning on releasing a riff to

826
00:48:09,682 --> 00:48:10,042
their riff?

827
00:48:12,008 --> 00:48:13,009
Thank you for that, first of all.

828
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:15,913
Yeah, that was a popular theme for sure,

829
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:18,336
and I did hear the Medieval Man version,

830
00:48:18,356 --> 00:48:20,058
and I actually met the composer of that

831
00:48:20,378 --> 00:48:22,921
at a Video Games Live show a few years back,

832
00:48:22,981 --> 00:48:25,104
and so we had a fun chat about that.

833
00:48:26,797 --> 00:48:32,880
Yeah, it's just one of those things where you just come up with a fun idea and you make

834
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:35,962
a song out of it and it ends up in the game and it catches on.

835
00:48:37,943 --> 00:48:43,127
Same thing with the main theme to Red Alert, like Hellmarch, everybody just caught on to

836
00:48:43,167 --> 00:48:43,307
that.

837
00:48:43,347 --> 00:48:48,930
It's still a video meme for so many people to this day, so it's a fun homage.

838
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:50,351
So thank you for that, appreciate it.

839
00:48:52,334 --> 00:48:54,997
Because we're to both sides so we get everybody go ahead. Yeah

840
00:48:55,317 --> 00:49:01,585
During development were there any expectations of what would be more popular single-player versus multiplayer and

841
00:49:02,266 --> 00:49:04,008
Were you guys surprised by reactions to it?

842
00:49:05,761 --> 00:49:06,602
Take that one for design.

843
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:07,682
Yeah, sure.

844
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:10,124
I think at the time, multiplayer was still pretty new,

845
00:49:10,164 --> 00:49:11,906
so we didn't have a lot of expectations on it,

846
00:49:12,006 --> 00:49:14,368
but as people noted, people were staying late

847
00:49:14,468 --> 00:49:16,569
every night to play, which made my job

848
00:49:16,609 --> 00:49:17,550
balancing the game really easy,

849
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:19,091
because I was used to wander around the office

850
00:49:19,131 --> 00:49:21,533
and lurk over shoulders and get ideas.

851
00:49:22,093 --> 00:49:24,135
So I think going into it, we didn't know

852
00:49:24,175 --> 00:49:25,256
it would be as popular as it was,

853
00:49:25,316 --> 00:49:27,257
but we did get a sense of that before it came out,

854
00:49:27,317 --> 00:49:30,900
because people were literally staying 10, 11, 12 a night

855
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:33,802
to play on their own time, on their own dime, essentially.

856
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:35,776
Cool, thanks.

857
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:41,892
So for me the first RTS was mostly Dune II,

858
00:49:42,392 --> 00:49:44,313
which I was surprised wasn't mentioned at all

859
00:49:44,814 --> 00:49:45,474
during the talk.

860
00:49:45,874 --> 00:49:47,735
I don't know if there's a specific reason for it.

861
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,656
No, none whatsoever.

862
00:49:48,756 --> 00:49:51,177
Dune II was absolutely the first of the style of games

863
00:49:51,597 --> 00:49:54,259
that are recognized as RTSs and it had animated sequences.

864
00:49:54,279 --> 00:49:56,120
They just were on a single floppy

865
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,301
so they weren't full screen and video and all that.

866
00:49:58,921 --> 00:50:00,042
Postmortem is about Command and Conquer,

867
00:50:00,062 --> 00:50:00,762
but you're absolutely right.

868
00:50:00,782 --> 00:50:02,563
That's the very first game, also made by Joe Bostic,

869
00:50:03,063 --> 00:50:06,625
and he was a principal designer as well as coder on that.

870
00:50:06,885 --> 00:50:08,726
Which was amazing, thank you for that.

871
00:50:08,746 --> 00:50:17,010
But I was wondering if, because one of the biggest additions was being able to move multiple units at the same time,

872
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:19,011
which was a huge pain in the ass in Dune.

873
00:50:19,591 --> 00:50:21,853
But did you take other inspirations?

874
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:25,814
Did you try to improve on what was done with Dune?

875
00:50:25,834 --> 00:50:28,656
Because, yeah, multiple people worked on both games.

876
00:50:29,236 --> 00:50:34,420
Yeah, I mean, I don't want to... I mentioned earlier there's some folks that just don't like doing public speaking, so I'm not gonna...

877
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:34,920
Okay.

878
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:37,642
I'm not gonna... I'm gonna hit poor Joe. He is here, but...

879
00:50:37,662 --> 00:50:38,183
Okay, fair enough.

880
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:39,203
I'm not gonna make him do that.

881
00:50:39,804 --> 00:50:44,307
So I'll answer for him, and he can correct me if I was wrong later, but we absolutely got inspiration from all sorts of games,

882
00:50:45,148 --> 00:50:50,812
everything from Horse Ox-Fi to Cytron Masters. There was three games. There was Rescue Raiders...

883
00:50:51,833 --> 00:50:55,135
Populous 2, Rescue Raiders, Military Madness,

884
00:50:55,416 --> 00:50:57,938
Military Madness, and I can't remember the third one,

885
00:50:57,958 --> 00:50:59,179
but there were these three games that,

886
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:01,020
Middleman, Military Madness on the NEC,

887
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:04,803
and they had this sort of feeling about them

888
00:51:04,843 --> 00:51:07,085
of being able to do, strategy games at that time

889
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:08,866
were thought to have to be turn-based

890
00:51:08,886 --> 00:51:09,587
so you had time to think.

891
00:51:10,047 --> 00:51:12,409
And all these games had a way of putting you under pressure

892
00:51:12,449 --> 00:51:14,130
and making you have to think and move at the same time.

893
00:51:14,551 --> 00:51:15,912
And so there was lots of inputs from all that.

894
00:51:16,232 --> 00:51:17,893
And I have to say, somebody mentioned it earlier

895
00:51:17,953 --> 00:51:18,654
for the songs.

896
00:51:19,654 --> 00:51:20,835
In the beginning, there was some tension

897
00:51:20,855 --> 00:51:22,316
between Westwood and Blizzard.

898
00:51:22,336 --> 00:51:24,178
I could tell you all about this some other time why that was.

899
00:51:24,258 --> 00:51:28,201
But once the team started really deviating the products

900
00:51:28,261 --> 00:51:29,982
and they were clearly distinctive,

901
00:51:30,623 --> 00:51:32,204
I always found that it was really inspiring.

902
00:51:32,764 --> 00:51:34,225
And having another company out there

903
00:51:34,245 --> 00:51:35,686
that was trying to one-up the game.

904
00:51:36,047 --> 00:51:37,388
really made you work a little bit harder.

905
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:40,730
And I think healthy competition is really important

906
00:51:41,191 --> 00:51:43,712
in any medium, and it's great to have somebody

907
00:51:43,752 --> 00:51:45,674
like Blizzard that kept us on our toes,

908
00:51:46,214 --> 00:51:47,836
and each time we would wanna outdo each other.

909
00:51:47,856 --> 00:51:50,718
And obviously you see where they've gone

910
00:51:50,798 --> 00:51:53,059
as far as quality is one of the most revered

911
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,141
and rightfully so game companies in the world.

912
00:51:55,541 --> 00:51:57,783
So yeah, we took inspiration from all sorts of places.

913
00:51:57,843 --> 00:51:59,304
And I don't know if you guys wanna add anything.

914
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:02,447
Yeah, if I remember correctly, I could be misremembering,

915
00:52:02,467 --> 00:52:04,268
but I think early on with C&C,

916
00:52:06,449 --> 00:52:07,690
we wanted to make it so you didn't have to

917
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:10,632
sort of repeatedly click on the sidebar to the actions.

918
00:52:11,432 --> 00:52:12,973
So I think the early versions of the games,

919
00:52:13,013 --> 00:52:14,433
you could click a unit and move it,

920
00:52:15,114 --> 00:52:16,314
but you could not drag select.

921
00:52:16,475 --> 00:52:17,995
And the drag select was added, it was like,

922
00:52:18,015 --> 00:52:19,936
hey, what if, it wasn't sort of a design,

923
00:52:20,356 --> 00:52:23,238
it wasn't sort of, hey, we will do massive drag select.

924
00:52:23,278 --> 00:52:24,399
Well we experienced the same pain

925
00:52:24,419 --> 00:52:25,419
that everybody else was experiencing.

926
00:52:25,439 --> 00:52:26,039
Yeah, it was like, you know,

927
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:27,320
we want to move a lot of stuff at once.

928
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,822
So I kind of have this memory of staying late one night

929
00:52:31,102 --> 00:52:32,903
and sitting with the engineers,

930
00:52:32,963 --> 00:52:34,984
and it's like, what if we just try drag select?

931
00:52:36,071 --> 00:52:38,352
and we just put it in and it seemed very natural

932
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:39,873
and we went with that obviously.

933
00:52:40,753 --> 00:52:42,774
So yeah, but I think initially we had,

934
00:52:42,794 --> 00:52:45,355
it was more context driven way,

935
00:52:45,395 --> 00:52:47,156
you could click on a unit and then click move,

936
00:52:47,757 --> 00:52:49,618
but it still didn't feel quite right

937
00:52:49,678 --> 00:52:52,099
and so the drag select I think made it a lot more fluid.

938
00:52:52,379 --> 00:52:53,860
Absolutely, thank you very much.

939
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:55,961
Yes, over here.

940
00:52:56,501 --> 00:52:59,622
Thank you all, and I gotta say that Command & Conquer

941
00:52:59,642 --> 00:53:01,423
had a big influence on not only me,

942
00:53:01,443 --> 00:53:02,683
but also my entire family,

943
00:53:02,903 --> 00:53:04,464
and our go-to was always Red Alert.

944
00:53:05,124 --> 00:53:08,886
So if Red Alert came out, as I'm just sort of

945
00:53:08,906 --> 00:53:10,106
double-checking, Red Alert came out in 1996,

946
00:53:10,526 --> 00:53:13,327
but as you mentioned, making Command & Conquer,

947
00:53:13,347 --> 00:53:15,848
which came out in 1995, took a long time.

948
00:53:16,189 --> 00:53:18,910
Can you talk a little bit about the transition

949
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:23,051
into the second game, and what was easy to redo,

950
00:53:23,131 --> 00:53:24,172
and what wasn't easy to redo?

951
00:53:24,192 --> 00:53:24,972
You wanna take?

952
00:53:25,346 --> 00:53:29,128
Yeah, I think, and again, it's been 25 years, so my memory is hazy as well.

953
00:53:30,328 --> 00:53:33,850
As I recall, Red Alert was originally going to be an add-on to Command & Conquer.

954
00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:34,310
That's right.

955
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:39,713
And it just kept growing and taking on a life of its own and eventually became its own product.

956
00:53:40,073 --> 00:53:45,416
But, yeah, originally we were just going to do a release for the 50th anniversary of World War II or something.

957
00:53:45,536 --> 00:53:47,557
Yeah, I think it was supposed to be like a four-month project.

958
00:53:47,598 --> 00:53:50,960
Actually, I can add a little bit to that, because the original one was supposed to be...

959
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:56,684
I told you earlier, the inspiration, a lot of discussions with Brett about the near-future technology

960
00:53:56,704 --> 00:53:58,386
that was just around the corner, that was Command & Conquer,

961
00:53:58,406 --> 00:54:00,968
was supposed to be just beyond reach, we could imagine it existing today.

962
00:54:02,289 --> 00:54:04,970
And so Red Alert, as we were doing historical research,

963
00:54:05,391 --> 00:54:07,432
came up quite a bit, that there was a lot of stuff

964
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:08,933
like the Philadelphia experiment,

965
00:54:09,113 --> 00:54:10,775
and most of the stuff in the original,

966
00:54:10,795 --> 00:54:12,176
in fact everything in the original Red Alert,

967
00:54:12,236 --> 00:54:15,118
was actually, somebody thought that would work, right?

968
00:54:15,198 --> 00:54:16,699
So that was the fun of it,

969
00:54:16,739 --> 00:54:18,620
was like the attack of the 50 foot woman,

970
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,862
the 50s where science was kind of like magic,

971
00:54:20,902 --> 00:54:21,743
anything could happen.

972
00:54:22,723 --> 00:54:23,904
That was actually inspiration,

973
00:54:23,924 --> 00:54:26,326
and it was like, hey, after covert operations,

974
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:28,628
which were really just hard versions in the dino missions,

975
00:54:29,088 --> 00:54:33,891
Let's do something that's more thematic around this sort of historical,

976
00:54:34,131 --> 00:54:38,074
almost magical kind of technology, this magical revering of technology.

977
00:54:38,595 --> 00:54:40,316
And as it started getting bigger and bigger,

978
00:54:40,336 --> 00:54:43,358
it was pretty clear that it just had a different sense to it.

979
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:47,281
And it was, certainly in the early days, people always ask this,

980
00:54:47,661 --> 00:54:49,142
was it part of the Command and Conquer universe?

981
00:54:49,442 --> 00:54:50,943
In the early days, it was undecided.

982
00:54:51,343 --> 00:54:53,085
It was intentionally not.

983
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:55,326
forced to be one thing or another,

984
00:54:55,406 --> 00:54:57,126
that's actually why Cain shows up in there and everything.

985
00:54:57,146 --> 00:54:58,206
That's more about Cain's backstory

986
00:54:58,226 --> 00:54:58,927
than it is about Red Alert.

987
00:54:59,867 --> 00:55:02,787
And it was fun too, just we ended up asking

988
00:55:02,847 --> 00:55:04,408
some what if questions about a lot of it

989
00:55:04,488 --> 00:55:05,588
to determine what would happen.

990
00:55:05,828 --> 00:55:07,129
And one of the questions was,

991
00:55:07,689 --> 00:55:09,489
what if Einstein had invented a time machine?

992
00:55:09,669 --> 00:55:10,629
No, he's too smart.

993
00:55:10,669 --> 00:55:12,190
He would never have actually used it.

994
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:13,290
He knows the repercussions.

995
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:15,931
Well, maybe he would remove Hitler from history.

996
00:55:16,291 --> 00:55:18,131
So then that led to a lot of other ideas

997
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:20,032
and it just kept going and going and going

998
00:55:20,052 --> 00:55:21,812
until it was out of control and had to be its own product.

999
00:55:22,388 --> 00:55:23,809
So we've got one time for one more question.

1000
00:55:24,169 --> 00:55:26,371
Got two minutes because then we have a special thing to end

1001
00:55:26,391 --> 00:55:26,732
this with.

1002
00:55:26,752 --> 00:55:27,693
OK?

1003
00:55:28,473 --> 00:55:28,654
Hi.

1004
00:55:29,634 --> 00:55:35,059
My question for each of you four is GDI or not?

1005
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:40,204
When those Tiberium crystals crash land on our planet and

1006
00:55:40,464 --> 00:55:44,188
kick off the eternal war, who will you swear

1007
00:55:44,208 --> 00:55:45,108
your allegiance to?

1008
00:55:45,268 --> 00:55:46,309
Brotherhood, unity, peace.

1009
00:55:50,445 --> 00:55:52,906
You know, I can't take sides because then it would...

1010
00:55:53,346 --> 00:55:53,887
Aww.

1011
00:55:53,927 --> 00:55:55,067
Wah, wah, wah.

1012
00:55:55,948 --> 00:55:59,270
If I had taken sides, one side would have been way out of balance.

1013
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:04,072
It wouldn't have been fair and everyone would have complained about how I favor GDI over

1014
00:56:04,132 --> 00:56:04,513
Nod.

1015
00:56:06,834 --> 00:56:11,056
Yeah, in my mind I want to say GDI, but I suspect in real life I might be tempted by

1016
00:56:11,096 --> 00:56:11,797
the Nod side.

1017
00:56:14,438 --> 00:56:18,521
Well, I wore the Nod jacket at MAGFest, so I think that's been an appearance.

1018
00:56:19,941 --> 00:56:20,062
So...
