00:00:05,749 --> 00:00:08,251
Welcome to Exploring Hidden Stories in the World of XCOM 2.

2
00:00:08,251 --> 00:00:12,894
GDC's almost done, guys, so this should be good.

3
00:00:12,894 --> 00:00:15,195
Just a couple more talks.

4
00:00:15,195 --> 00:00:16,897
My name is Justin Rodriguez.

5
00:00:16,897 --> 00:00:19,758
I'm a senior environment artist at Firaxis Games.

6
00:00:19,758 --> 00:00:22,200
I've been at Firaxis for nine years.

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,542
And throughout that time, I've worked on all the XCOM titles

8
00:00:24,542 --> 00:00:27,564
that Firaxis has shipped, from XCOM Enemy Unknown, which

9
00:00:27,564 --> 00:00:29,805
you'll hear me today talking about as XCOM EU,

10
00:00:29,805 --> 00:00:32,767
all the way till XCOM 2 War of the Chosen.

11
00:00:34,181 --> 00:00:37,527
Before we get started, how many of you have played XCOM?

12
00:00:37,527 --> 00:00:38,148
Very cool.

13
00:00:38,148 --> 00:00:40,952
How about War of the Chosen?

14
00:00:40,952 --> 00:00:42,074
Awesome.

15
00:00:42,074 --> 00:00:44,478
Before we get started, I'm going to show a video so we can

16
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:46,661
get into the mood of XCOM.

17
00:01:46,337 --> 00:01:49,959
So XCOM 2 is a tactical turn-based, cover-based strategy game.

18
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:54,242
It's safe to say that working on environments for this game is complex.

19
00:01:54,242 --> 00:01:58,545
What you're seeing right now is basically just our pathing visualization,

20
00:01:58,545 --> 00:02:00,247
and that's just not everything that we can look at.

21
00:02:00,247 --> 00:02:05,050
It could be even more complex looking if we start adding collision to this.

22
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:08,713
And not only was the game complex just from a markup side,

23
00:02:08,713 --> 00:02:10,634
but it also had multiple camera angles.

24
00:02:10,634 --> 00:02:14,897
What you see right now is the default camera angle and the glam cam shot when

25
00:02:15,413 --> 00:02:19,277
you're picking your shot and shooting at the aliens.

26
00:02:19,277 --> 00:02:22,199
And most of our buildings and environments were destructible.

27
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:25,962
And all the levels were procedural.

28
00:02:25,962 --> 00:02:32,108
This is one of the small town levels that you guys might have seen in the game.

29
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:34,990
And this is the exact same level with a supermarket.

30
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:39,434
And this snowy church level with a playground to the left is also the same level.

31
00:02:39,434 --> 00:02:41,916
All of these factors...

32
00:02:42,587 --> 00:02:45,308
led to extensive markup in all the levels

33
00:02:45,308 --> 00:02:48,829
for both environment artists and the level designers.

34
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:50,670
So how do you weave narrative storytelling

35
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,091
into a procedural environment?

36
00:02:53,091 --> 00:02:54,351
During XCOM 2 production,

37
00:02:54,351 --> 00:03:00,113
I was responsible for creating props, textures, and world building

38
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:03,015
and decorating roughly 76 out of the 174 core levels.

39
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:06,656
If we were to count all the smaller levels in the game,

40
00:03:06,656 --> 00:03:08,136
there was 508 level components in XCOM 2.

41
00:03:08,136 --> 00:03:11,758
I had the help of, with Prop Create,

42
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:12,198
I had the help.

43
00:03:12,933 --> 00:03:16,354
of two junior artists, interns, and one lighting artist.

44
00:03:16,354 --> 00:03:20,435
Now before we go any further,

45
00:03:20,435 --> 00:03:24,437
I'm going to do a quick explanation of just how these levels worked. So what you see here is the

46
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:26,497
same small town level

47
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:29,378
and this is how the levels were actually put together.

48
00:03:29,378 --> 00:03:32,599
The whole entire level was called a

49
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:36,481
plot and we had holes so the actual levels could socket

50
00:03:36,481 --> 00:03:38,882
into this and those we called parcels.

51
00:03:40,105 --> 00:03:43,688
Most of these levels could also be rotated 360 degrees.

52
00:03:43,688 --> 00:03:48,272
And many levels had to work in different biomes and weather

53
00:03:48,272 --> 00:03:51,395
conditions, like we saw before.

54
00:03:51,395 --> 00:03:54,017
A lot of time was spent marking up textures and adding weather

55
00:03:54,017 --> 00:03:55,238
assets for biome swapping.

56
00:03:55,238 --> 00:03:58,041
What you see right here is one of the two small town homes.

57
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:02,185
And there's icicles in the snow version of this level.

58
00:04:02,185 --> 00:04:05,247
All of those were hand placed and hand filtered

59
00:04:05,247 --> 00:04:07,089
in different layers in game.

60
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:11,510
With doing all this, we knew that larger narrative elements

61
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:15,632
would not work in procedural environments, at least for ours.

62
00:04:15,632 --> 00:04:17,574
We could limit the map rotation and limit

63
00:04:17,574 --> 00:04:18,974
the randomness of levels.

64
00:04:18,974 --> 00:04:22,537
But it made the maps feel, look, and play too similar.

65
00:04:22,537 --> 00:04:25,118
Uncertain how we would solve this issue,

66
00:04:25,118 --> 00:04:27,880
we began art passes and world building on the levels.

67
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,141
During this time, we made an effort

68
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:30,762
to update levels with level design.

69
00:04:30,762 --> 00:04:32,963
What you see here is actually a couple tests

70
00:04:32,963 --> 00:04:35,705
to see how we could add a pop of color

71
00:04:35,705 --> 00:04:37,085
within the interior spaces.

72
00:04:37,085 --> 00:04:37,866
Because at the time.

73
00:04:38,176 --> 00:04:43,400
We didn't know whether or not we wanted really colorful exteriors of the buildings,

74
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:49,626
because what if a very red building came in and procedurally plopped right next to a very blue building?

75
00:04:49,626 --> 00:04:51,307
It would start to look rainbowy, and we didn't want that.

76
00:04:51,307 --> 00:04:56,712
So working on each one of these levels, we wanted to make sure that they still felt distinct,

77
00:04:56,712 --> 00:04:58,593
but worked in any random combination.

78
00:04:58,593 --> 00:05:05,139
After a few levels, we became confident we could look, make the procedural levels work and look good.

79
00:05:06,104 --> 00:05:08,945
But we thought we could do more than just a quick set dressing pass.

80
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:12,447
We wanted every level in XCOM to feel fun and interesting,

81
00:05:12,447 --> 00:05:14,147
like the first game we shipped, XCOM EU.

82
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:18,769
Also, it's a tactical turn-based strategy game.

83
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:21,690
So that means that in between turns,

84
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,752
we know that the players are going to be looking at the environments.

85
00:05:24,752 --> 00:05:28,693
So with limited concept support and hundreds of levels to work on,

86
00:05:28,693 --> 00:05:32,055
a few of us were constantly brainstorming to find an identity for each level.

87
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:38,411
It was at this point that someone had proposed that we looked at old XCOM EU maps for inspiration.

88
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:41,452
We created new brands for stores and restaurants in the game for XCOM 2,

89
00:05:41,452 --> 00:05:44,733
but we thought it would be cool to give an old nod to the XCOM EU businesses.

90
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:49,875
This is when I loaded up one of my favorite levels from the old game,

91
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,915
Office Paper.

92
00:05:51,915 --> 00:05:58,137
The shop paper company was a funny detail that came from the in the path of XCOM 2's micro stories.

93
00:05:59,503 --> 00:06:02,925
Jeremy was the lead graphics programmer on the project for XCOM EU,

94
00:06:02,925 --> 00:06:07,848
and we thought it would be cool to put his name in the game with a couple of ours.

95
00:06:07,848 --> 00:06:13,512
So, when I saw this, I was inspired enough to follow this story

96
00:06:13,512 --> 00:06:15,513
of the Shup paper company into XCOM 2.

97
00:06:15,513 --> 00:06:19,855
I wanted to explore what happened to it in the world of alien occupation.

98
00:06:19,855 --> 00:06:23,738
I figured Shup, the company CEO, with his quick initiative,

99
00:06:23,738 --> 00:06:26,640
would have diversified his company knowing that alien occupation

100
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,701
would bring a swift end to the paper industry on Earth.

101
00:06:30,033 --> 00:06:32,954
So Shuff Paper Company became Shuff Material Industries in XCOM 2.

102
00:06:32,954 --> 00:06:40,836
After doing this, finishing levels became easier and had better results when embracing the impression of smaller details.

103
00:06:40,836 --> 00:06:46,158
The team loves seeing stories created from the inclusion of one or two extra story props in a level.

104
00:06:46,158 --> 00:06:50,179
As you can see here, this is one of our small town levels.

105
00:06:50,179 --> 00:06:55,741
We made it to make sure it fit into our feel of the small town, kind of run down, but at one point...

106
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,581
When working with one of the other artists, he said,

107
00:06:58,581 --> 00:07:00,141
you know what would just really make this?

108
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:00,682
I said, what?

109
00:07:00,682 --> 00:07:02,683
He said, just a little detail.

110
00:07:02,683 --> 00:07:04,523
So I found a Frisbee and just put it on the roof.

111
00:07:04,523 --> 00:07:05,244
He said, that's great.

112
00:07:05,244 --> 00:07:09,285
I was now thinking up stories first too, before decorating.

113
00:07:09,285 --> 00:07:12,547
And this was a great way to stay actively engaged

114
00:07:12,547 --> 00:07:14,007
in world building for almost 80 levels.

115
00:07:14,007 --> 00:07:16,068
It helped do away with generic deco passes.

116
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:16,989
The narrative details are small

117
00:07:16,989 --> 00:07:20,070
and delicately placed around each level.

118
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,911
And all of these details are small enough

119
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:24,692
to work in any level layout or rotation.

120
00:07:25,498 --> 00:07:29,240
I also began to add various ranges of micro stories to the levels.

121
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,361
What you see here on the screen, there's a blanket and a pillow on the ground.

122
00:07:33,361 --> 00:07:35,482
I used to call those the sleepers when we were working on those.

123
00:07:35,482 --> 00:07:40,705
And basically I had this idea that within the alien occupied Earth,

124
00:07:40,705 --> 00:07:42,946
the Vaxcom-2, people were kind of misplaced.

125
00:07:42,946 --> 00:07:43,766
They didn't have homes.

126
00:07:43,766 --> 00:07:47,608
So you would just see somewhere where they shacked up for the night or

127
00:07:47,608 --> 00:07:51,730
basically try to sleep somewhere and they would leave the next day or

128
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,191
maybe that was the last place that they spent.

129
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:59,475
Now also with that, that's a detail that I put all over the place.

130
00:07:59,475 --> 00:08:03,376
I also had specific ones that were just in one level, like the pizza party.

131
00:08:03,376 --> 00:08:03,736
Cowabunga.

132
00:08:03,736 --> 00:08:07,037
So throughout production of XCOM 2 and expansion of War of the Chosen,

133
00:08:07,037 --> 00:08:12,638
I actively worked to refine my process and establish a few techniques

134
00:08:12,638 --> 00:08:17,279
that became helpful in creating the small-town narratives

135
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,400
decorated throughout the game.

136
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,121
I'll just share some of these with you right now.

137
00:08:22,121 --> 00:08:23,221
So, first...

138
00:08:24,054 --> 00:08:24,614
Be resourceful.

139
00:08:24,614 --> 00:08:26,155
Not much time to create.

140
00:08:26,155 --> 00:08:30,056
You don't have much time to create stories

141
00:08:30,056 --> 00:08:32,277
with unique assets, especially in XCOM.

142
00:08:32,277 --> 00:08:36,259
Getting in the mindset of creating unique from generic

143
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:39,060
is something really good that you can kind of adhere to.

144
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,242
And create characters and follow them.

145
00:08:43,242 --> 00:08:45,083
I created anonymous characters for all the props

146
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:48,404
that I used to decorate within XCOM 2.

147
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:50,465
And you'll see that in a few minutes here.

148
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:53,259
and gather small deco to make landmarks.

149
00:08:53,259 --> 00:08:55,580
There's no need for giant statues and set pieces.

150
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,020
Unique props take time and you don't have much reuse.

151
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:04,421
So try to make a story with just a few small assets.

152
00:09:04,421 --> 00:09:06,282
Establish breadcrumbs and motifs.

153
00:09:06,282 --> 00:09:08,962
Basically, whenever you use something

154
00:09:08,962 --> 00:09:11,103
as small as a flower pot,

155
00:09:11,103 --> 00:09:13,583
and you know if you're gonna use it somewhere else,

156
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:16,664
make sure that you think about why these assets

157
00:09:16,664 --> 00:09:19,264
are being placed in multiple locations or multiple levels.

158
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:21,482
and flow with level design.

159
00:09:21,482 --> 00:09:24,524
When you do deco your maps and your levels,

160
00:09:24,524 --> 00:09:28,728
make sure that the player will see them,

161
00:09:28,728 --> 00:09:33,352
or they enhance the story by, or enhance the player's

162
00:09:33,352 --> 00:09:34,653
exploration.

163
00:09:34,653 --> 00:09:37,015
I worked very hard with the level designers

164
00:09:37,015 --> 00:09:39,477
to make sure everything that I did place in the game

165
00:09:39,477 --> 00:09:43,441
was near cover points or specific locations

166
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:44,802
that we knew that the player would travel.

167
00:09:47,116 --> 00:09:51,238
I knew I didn't have much time or space for large narrative set pieces, so small assets

168
00:09:51,238 --> 00:09:54,140
became my go-to props in creating stories and leaving narrative hints.

169
00:09:54,140 --> 00:10:00,964
These are just some of my favorite props to use, and if you play Dexxon 2, you'll see

170
00:10:00,964 --> 00:10:02,285
them in a lot of places.

171
00:10:02,285 --> 00:10:06,807
Now I'm going to take you through a few examples of my micro-stories.

172
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:08,728
Flowerpot Man.

173
00:10:08,728 --> 00:10:15,412
Slums levels and buildings were some of the last levels to be designed by Level Design.

174
00:10:15,412 --> 00:10:16,213
They were...

175
00:10:16,606 --> 00:10:19,767
two-story buildings that had business on the bottom and an apartment up top.

176
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:23,327
So before I started decorating in the levels, I went through each level and assigned a business

177
00:10:23,327 --> 00:10:28,528
to the first floor and a character who lived above. This apartment belongs to the flowerpot man.

178
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:34,929
Flowerpot man is a single male and he's extremely passionate about growing plants and living in a

179
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:40,590
better environment. You can basically see here that on the rooftop I reused some of the small

180
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:45,511
town assets and had a little water collection for him and just flowerpots. This guy was just

181
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:46,332
growing as much.

182
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:52,655
plants as he possibly could, hopefully to bring back the ozone of this alien occupied

183
00:10:52,655 --> 00:10:52,935
Earth.

184
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:58,457
So whenever I placed the flowerpots in slums, I always thought about Flowerpot Mountain

185
00:10:58,457 --> 00:10:59,498
and how they got there.

186
00:10:59,498 --> 00:11:04,800
My hope was to use these flowerpots all over this house to landmark the level for the player.

187
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,062
This asset was made and primarily used in small town, like I said, and I hoped the cross-pollination

188
00:11:10,062 --> 00:11:13,024
would help seat slums in the same world or universe of XCOM 2.

189
00:11:15,804 --> 00:11:21,088
Since these flower pots were so small, it also helped me keep these slums levels feeling utilitarian.

190
00:11:21,088 --> 00:11:28,254
The decision to follow Flowerpot Man also helped me make the rooftops of slums feel unique as well.

191
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:34,399
So when you're on top, as you know if you play XCOM, you do get bonuses for shooting

192
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,822
on rooftops. So I thought that would be kind of a cool place to put most of my deco.

193
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:38,703
So here's another story that I've

194
00:11:43,962 --> 00:11:46,082
worked on is called the family in the shrine.

195
00:11:46,082 --> 00:11:48,043
When I when

196
00:11:48,043 --> 00:11:49,404
some of the concept paintings started

197
00:11:49,404 --> 00:11:51,865
being finished for the paintings

198
00:11:51,865 --> 00:11:54,005
that you find in the game.

199
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,166
There was one that one of our concept artists

200
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,067
made that was of a family.

201
00:11:58,067 --> 00:12:00,168
And I almost went back to the concept artist

202
00:12:00,168 --> 00:12:01,928
and said listen this is too

203
00:12:01,928 --> 00:12:03,869
unique. I want to have something

204
00:12:03,869 --> 00:12:05,810
that's generic enough that I can place in a lot of levels.

205
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,830
And before I went over I said you know what I'm going

206
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,271
to try to make a story out of this and I'm going to make sure

207
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,552
that I'm only going to put it in one or two

208
00:12:11,552 --> 00:12:12,432
levels in the game.

209
00:12:13,965 --> 00:12:17,587
So I decided to leverage this unique painting to make a story.

210
00:12:17,587 --> 00:12:20,428
So as you can see, it's a family of three.

211
00:12:20,428 --> 00:12:25,551
My whole idea was that the father and mother split because of the alien invasion.

212
00:12:25,551 --> 00:12:31,093
And I left breadcrumbs trying to show that the aliens were attempting to kind of coerce the humans

213
00:12:31,093 --> 00:12:35,175
to move through the alien-made city centers or our futuristic cities in XCOM 2.

214
00:12:37,368 --> 00:12:47,115
As you can see here, this is kind of a culmination of not only the painting and slums that you would see in the small town building or the house, but there's also just other little details here.

215
00:12:47,115 --> 00:13:03,267
So I figured that the mother would live in this slum's apartment, and there's a little, you know, pillow and a blanket here where she would basically think about her family or, you know, while looking at this kind of shrine that she made.

216
00:13:03,267 --> 00:13:04,268
And you can also see that.

217
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,823
That was hard to see, but I actually have an XCOM symbol over the father's head.

218
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:14,585
She must have been cursed by the aliens, but the father actually was trying to support XCOM.

219
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:22,568
Actually, let me just go back here. You can also see right to the right, there's a propaganda center cross.

220
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:29,932
That was one of the alien symbols that the Advent had in their propaganda centers.

221
00:13:29,932 --> 00:13:31,753
I had it here, kind of...

222
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,292
trying to create a breadcrumb to this small town level where we had a church

223
00:13:36,292 --> 00:13:40,995
and the propaganda symbol is also on the back of the church wall.

224
00:13:40,995 --> 00:13:50,520
So here's one of my last stories I'll share with you guys. The eye doctor. Really quick,

225
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:58,765
we'll get through this one. We only had so many futuristic assets for slums and there was one

226
00:13:58,765 --> 00:14:02,507
asset that wasn't being used, just a set of 3D printers that we used for cover.

227
00:14:03,447 --> 00:14:07,889
And I decided to kind of place these in the bottom of the business.

228
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:10,970
Now, like I said, the second story was always the apartment,

229
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:14,971
the first story was a restaurant or some sort of business.

230
00:14:14,971 --> 00:14:17,752
But we didn't have any doctors' offices or anything,

231
00:14:17,752 --> 00:14:19,072
so I decided to make an optometrist.

232
00:14:19,072 --> 00:14:22,374
So I thought it would be cool that you would walk into his optometrist,

233
00:14:22,374 --> 00:14:25,995
this futuristic one, and immediately get your eyes scanned,

234
00:14:25,995 --> 00:14:27,875
and they would 3D print your glasses right there.

235
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,936
And when I was trying to figure out who would live above,

236
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:33,337
that the doctor that worked there was...

237
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:38,371
actually living in the apartment above. At around the same time I got a set of

238
00:14:38,371 --> 00:14:40,432
children's toys to help deco the levels.

239
00:14:40,432 --> 00:14:43,713
I thought it would be cool that if

240
00:14:43,713 --> 00:14:48,194
that the doctor would after his, you know, after work day would

241
00:14:48,194 --> 00:14:51,654
use the 3D printers to print out toy cars for

242
00:14:51,654 --> 00:14:57,116
the children in the slums neighborhood. So you can see here there's actually a little

243
00:14:57,116 --> 00:14:59,356
toy car there, and in his apartment on the deck

244
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,637
he's priming some of these toy cars or painting them.

245
00:15:04,062 --> 00:15:08,005
And then I would start to try and decorate any other house

246
00:15:08,005 --> 00:15:10,607
that I knew that I had children living in the apartment

247
00:15:10,607 --> 00:15:11,868
with some of these toy cars.

248
00:15:11,868 --> 00:15:13,329
So you can't see them here, but if you

249
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,790
look in the satellite dish, they're

250
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,451
actually kind of pushing them around and racing them

251
00:15:17,451 --> 00:15:18,152
around there.

252
00:15:18,152 --> 00:15:21,154
So real quick, let's just summarize the techniques

253
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:23,055
and tips that I used.

254
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:26,598
Try your best with props you have available to you.

255
00:15:26,598 --> 00:15:30,380
You won't always have this ability to have unique assets,

256
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,262
but you can make something out of nothing.

257
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:35,760
Assign characters and create specific,

258
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,341
assign characters to specific props you use to decorate.

259
00:15:40,341 --> 00:15:41,982
And don't rely on large set pieces

260
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,963
and unique assets to create landmarks for the player.

261
00:15:43,963 --> 00:15:47,904
As you can see here, I just had a couple of folding chairs.

262
00:15:47,904 --> 00:15:49,225
This is in our sewers level.

263
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:54,972
XCOM War of the Chosen. And I just kind of used these right next to the wall,

264
00:15:54,972 --> 00:15:59,354
and I propagated some of them near cover pieces where the soldiers can take cover.

265
00:15:59,354 --> 00:16:05,877
And my whole idea with this is that maybe there's a couple old men from New York City that were

266
00:16:05,877 --> 00:16:09,919
still trying to play chess even though they had to live in the sewers.

267
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:12,140
And establish breadcrumbs and motifs.

268
00:16:13,517 --> 00:16:17,140
Like I said, if I used the chess set,

269
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,982
I have used a chess set in the sewers,

270
00:16:18,982 --> 00:16:21,123
I would always think it was kind of the same guys

271
00:16:21,123 --> 00:16:22,705
that were finding these chess sets

272
00:16:22,705 --> 00:16:25,347
and playing chess before the adjunct came in

273
00:16:25,347 --> 00:16:25,848
and broke it up.

274
00:16:25,848 --> 00:16:27,469
One other tip for you guys,

275
00:16:27,469 --> 00:16:30,032
keep your Deco characters anonymous.

276
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:32,814
It just makes it easier to kind of move through

277
00:16:32,814 --> 00:16:37,558
these levels faster and you don't have to worry about

278
00:16:37,558 --> 00:16:38,940
doing a little too much with these stories

279
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,640
if you don't have time.

280
00:16:41,236 --> 00:16:45,298
The deck of characters in the space don't need to be identified to be effective.

281
00:16:45,298 --> 00:16:50,180
However, if one of your characters is received well by the team or fans,

282
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,001
maybe they can be identified.

283
00:16:53,001 --> 00:16:55,523
This is the, I don't know if you can see it,

284
00:16:55,523 --> 00:16:59,384
but this is the last resting place of our poor graphics programmer, Jeremy Shop.

285
00:16:59,384 --> 00:17:04,127
It says on the wall, I was the paper king.

286
00:17:04,127 --> 00:17:06,868
So he definitely regrets moving to material industries.

287
00:17:06,868 --> 00:17:10,090
And trust yourself for inspiration.

288
00:17:10,927 --> 00:17:19,731
Flowerpot man's silly, I know, but having these characters and stories helped me deco all these levels and give them the bespoke details they deserved.

289
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:22,432
Small details and little stories you create will be enough to fill these spaces.

290
00:17:22,432 --> 00:17:24,273
And it's okay to be weird. In fact, try to be.

291
00:17:24,273 --> 00:17:29,395
We only use mannequins in one of the abandoned city levels in War of the Chosen.

292
00:17:29,395 --> 00:17:34,998
I thought it was a missed opportunity, and I wanted to use more of them, but I was working on the sewers.

293
00:17:34,998 --> 00:17:36,938
So I decided to make a sewer fashion show.

294
00:17:36,938 --> 00:17:37,319
And try to up the ante.

295
00:17:40,588 --> 00:17:46,490
You know, when I did this and it received, you know, some interest from some of the other artists,

296
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:51,631
I said, what am I going to do next, you know, without making it too unique?

297
00:17:51,631 --> 00:17:57,012
Now, all these stories and details are helpful because it reinforces emergent gameplay.

298
00:17:57,012 --> 00:17:58,793
And XCOM thrives off that.

299
00:17:58,793 --> 00:18:02,193
You know, from playing XCOM, you really start to have a connection with your soldiers,

300
00:18:02,193 --> 00:18:03,354
especially if they're still living.

301
00:18:03,354 --> 00:18:07,995
And it adds depth to player experience.

302
00:18:08,716 --> 00:18:11,577
It helps fill in and reinforce XCOM 2's main story.

303
00:18:11,577 --> 00:18:13,597
All of these stories that I was working on,

304
00:18:13,597 --> 00:18:16,358
I always considered the fact of alien occupation

305
00:18:16,358 --> 00:18:18,918
and that all these people were either coerced

306
00:18:18,918 --> 00:18:21,679
and moved into the futuristic alien cities

307
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,619
or trying to make their way into smaller towns.

308
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:27,040
And most importantly, it inspires a player

309
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,800
to make their own.

310
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,000
And seeing these player stories,

311
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,741
I can be inspired to create new stories.

312
00:18:31,741 --> 00:18:35,722
This process has been rewarding during development

313
00:18:35,722 --> 00:18:36,742
of XCOM 2 and War of the Chosen,

314
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:38,322
and I hope to refine it in future products.

315
00:18:40,211 --> 00:18:43,812
I hope to refine my cooperation with the level design team.

316
00:18:43,812 --> 00:18:46,333
I hope earlier on in our next projects,

317
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,574
we can work on the mood and pacing of levels

318
00:18:48,574 --> 00:18:51,535
with some of these deco pieces.

319
00:18:51,535 --> 00:18:54,115
And it'll make it easier for me to hide these stories

320
00:18:54,115 --> 00:18:56,796
or put these stories in the levels.

321
00:18:56,796 --> 00:18:59,117
And the deco assets, I hope that we

322
00:18:59,117 --> 00:19:01,958
can work to get the scale and color

323
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,899
complement the gameplay interactables,

324
00:19:04,899 --> 00:19:05,579
like the cover assets.

325
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:09,100
And I would love to have heat maps in our future games.

326
00:19:09,805 --> 00:19:12,126
I could decorate these levels using these heat pads

327
00:19:12,126 --> 00:19:13,806
and inversely use them to hide cool details

328
00:19:13,806 --> 00:19:16,627
and promote exploration somewhere the player wouldn't go.

329
00:19:16,627 --> 00:19:19,868
I think it's important to note as well,

330
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:22,269
not every player will find or appreciate this work,

331
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:26,710
but the ones that do will enjoy more depth of the game that they love.

332
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:27,991
And it isn't wasted work.

333
00:19:27,991 --> 00:19:30,791
It allows you to have a direction when decorating the space

334
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:33,352
and will make sure that the levels you create are full of life.

335
00:19:33,981 --> 00:19:38,643
In fact, at the end of our slums production, we had a little bit of extra time.

336
00:19:38,643 --> 00:19:42,144
And they said, is there any other assets that we can make for you, Justin?

337
00:19:42,144 --> 00:19:46,745
And I said, you know, it'd be really cool if we could get some cool graffiti set pieces

338
00:19:46,745 --> 00:19:49,286
that kind of reference what's happening in the story.

339
00:19:49,286 --> 00:19:54,348
So one of our artists, Andrew, made these awesome graffiti pieces, and I hid them in

340
00:19:54,348 --> 00:19:58,149
the kind of the alleyways of the slums, and it really helped kind of landmark some of

341
00:19:58,149 --> 00:19:58,850
these other levels.

342
00:20:00,536 --> 00:20:05,460
And don't be afraid to get time or try to make time to do this.

343
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,003
Having rough estimates of how long this deco pass takes

344
00:20:09,003 --> 00:20:12,305
allows you to plan for it accurately with production.

345
00:20:12,305 --> 00:20:13,726
Balancing cost and time to decorate

346
00:20:13,726 --> 00:20:16,228
can be explored even by blocking out your deco assets

347
00:20:16,228 --> 00:20:18,050
in a proxy gray box phase.

348
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,172
This also helps you establish a sense of scale in your level.

349
00:20:21,172 --> 00:20:23,454
As you can see here, I'm actually

350
00:20:23,454 --> 00:20:28,878
walking you through the process of making the sewers.

351
00:20:28,878 --> 00:20:30,019
So what you're seeing is gray box.

352
00:20:31,123 --> 00:20:34,005
But even earlier on when I got some base textures in here,

353
00:20:34,005 --> 00:20:35,966
you can see that I'm already placing small deco down

354
00:20:35,966 --> 00:20:36,586
on the level.

355
00:20:36,586 --> 00:20:38,588
I wanted to make sure that everything

356
00:20:38,588 --> 00:20:41,870
that I wanted to outline in this level

357
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:45,152
was there so we could plan for it accordingly.

358
00:20:45,152 --> 00:20:47,553
You can even see gray box pictures on the walls,

359
00:20:47,553 --> 00:20:49,755
so I knew that I had time to make these assets,

360
00:20:49,755 --> 00:20:51,856
and I knew how they would fit into the space.

361
00:20:51,856 --> 00:20:54,097
And let your sense of wonder drive you

362
00:20:54,097 --> 00:20:56,399
when you decorate these environments in the game.

363
00:20:56,399 --> 00:20:58,020
It makes a task more rewarding and inspiring

364
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,041
to those around you.

365
00:21:00,996 --> 00:21:01,296
Let's go.

366
00:21:01,296 --> 00:21:03,817
So guys, thank you so much for coming to the talk.

367
00:21:03,817 --> 00:21:06,658
I'm always excited to talk about environment art

368
00:21:06,658 --> 00:21:08,158
and environmental storytelling.

369
00:21:08,158 --> 00:21:10,639
And feel free to contact me by email or Twitter.

370
00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:13,059
I also started the Environment Art Podcast

371
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:15,780
with the talented Ryan Benno from Somniac.

372
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,161
And let me know what you think.

373
00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:20,602
We just shipped the episode two

374
00:21:20,602 --> 00:21:22,542
of the podcast earlier this week.

375
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:26,443
And if you haven't played XCOM, which most of you have,

376
00:21:26,443 --> 00:21:27,324
or were the chosen, pick it up.

377
00:21:27,324 --> 00:21:27,804
It's a blast.

378
00:21:27,804 --> 00:21:28,884
Thank you guys.
