1
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:06,111
I'm going to go ahead and get started.

2
00:00:06,111 --> 00:00:08,992
Everyone, welcome. Thank you for showing up today.

3
00:00:08,992 --> 00:00:12,173
Good morning, good afternoon, depending on your state

4
00:00:12,173 --> 00:00:14,054
of jet-laggedness. Is that a word?

5
00:00:14,054 --> 00:00:15,334
Can I use jet-laggedness?

6
00:00:15,334 --> 00:00:18,195
Please remember to turn off your cell phones

7
00:00:18,195 --> 00:00:20,576
and all that other fun stuff that we typically tell you

8
00:00:20,576 --> 00:00:23,877
before one of these talks. My name is Jim Brown.

9
00:00:23,877 --> 00:00:26,197
I am from Epic Games,

10
00:00:26,197 --> 00:00:30,179
and my talk today is rational to emotional designs

11
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:31,319
that increase retention.

12
00:00:32,297 --> 00:00:36,938
And the word rational generally has very positive connotations,

13
00:00:36,938 --> 00:00:40,279
which might lead people to believe that if they're making rational decisions,

14
00:00:40,279 --> 00:00:42,060
they are therefore making good decisions.

15
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:48,622
And that's not always the case, because we're actually very often influenced

16
00:00:48,622 --> 00:00:50,982
by powerful emotions first,

17
00:00:50,982 --> 00:00:54,563
that we then try to rationalize the why after the fact.

18
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:59,303
And as I talk about emotions today, I want to be very clear that I'm not talking about

19
00:00:59,303 --> 00:01:02,045
ways to make players happy or sad.

20
00:01:02,045 --> 00:01:03,086
Those are feelings.

21
00:01:03,086 --> 00:01:08,790
Emotions are those core parts of us that are physical and instinctive.

22
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,213
They're programmed into us after years and years of evolution.

23
00:01:14,225 --> 00:01:16,646
And that makes them more universal to us as humans,

24
00:01:16,646 --> 00:01:19,168
as opposed to the feelings which make it,

25
00:01:19,168 --> 00:01:22,710
which are more unique to us as individuals.

26
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,732
And emotional design, therefore,

27
00:01:24,732 --> 00:01:28,694
gives us the capability to reach a broader audience

28
00:01:28,694 --> 00:01:29,915
in a deeper way.

29
00:01:29,915 --> 00:01:32,757
So I'll start today with a brief introduction

30
00:01:32,757 --> 00:01:33,898
to what emotional design is,

31
00:01:33,898 --> 00:01:35,059
because not a lot of people

32
00:01:35,059 --> 00:01:37,020
are really familiar with it, I believe.

33
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,642
And then roll into some more concrete examples

34
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:41,503
of how you can use it in your designs

35
00:01:41,503 --> 00:01:42,964
to help improve retention.

36
00:01:45,395 --> 00:01:50,999
While he likely doesn't need too much introduction with this audience, I hope, I do want to cover my bases.

37
00:01:50,999 --> 00:01:55,782
So this Dapper Fellow is of course Don Norman, a UX pioneer and icon.

38
00:01:55,782 --> 00:02:02,667
And he actually has a book about emotional design where he describes the specific design elements

39
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:09,031
that help us form attachments to things and how those attachments can help or can influence

40
00:02:09,031 --> 00:02:10,933
our experience using them.

41
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:16,207
He says that good emotional design has three major components.

42
00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:20,414
The visceral component, behavioral component, and a reflective component.

43
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:22,891
Now, the visceral, of course, is your gut reactions

44
00:02:22,891 --> 00:02:24,752
or how you respond to a stimulus.

45
00:02:24,752 --> 00:02:29,455
The behavioral asks, is something actually useful?

46
00:02:29,455 --> 00:02:32,257
Does it perform the way it's supposed to?

47
00:02:32,257 --> 00:02:35,960
And can it, through its use, somehow influence or change

48
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,641
your behavior?

49
00:02:36,641 --> 00:02:39,363
And then the reflectant component is,

50
00:02:39,363 --> 00:02:40,804
does it make me think about it?

51
00:02:40,804 --> 00:02:43,966
Especially after it's gone, do I think about it,

52
00:02:43,966 --> 00:02:46,248
the object that I was using, when it's no longer there?

53
00:02:46,248 --> 00:02:46,308
Now.

54
00:02:48,457 --> 00:02:55,501
Looking at each of these individually, that visceral component is really, really easy for us to get as a designer.

55
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:59,723
But visceral reactions tend to be very unpredictable.

56
00:02:59,723 --> 00:03:01,824
And as an example, I give you this.

57
00:03:01,824 --> 00:03:09,068
I can almost guarantee that everyone here has some sort of visceral reaction to seeing this image.

58
00:03:09,068 --> 00:03:15,432
But the problem is, I can't tell whether you're going to respond positively or negatively.

59
00:03:16,358 --> 00:03:19,762
because those reactions tend to be very personal

60
00:03:19,762 --> 00:03:22,344
based on your own context and experience.

61
00:03:23,463 --> 00:03:25,263
Visceral reactions are also very transient.

62
00:03:25,263 --> 00:03:27,684
So even though I've left this up here

63
00:03:27,684 --> 00:03:29,325
while I've continued to talk,

64
00:03:29,325 --> 00:03:30,725
it's probably even in that short time,

65
00:03:30,725 --> 00:03:33,306
any emotional response that you had

66
00:03:33,306 --> 00:03:35,887
has probably started to fade away.

67
00:03:35,887 --> 00:03:37,868
So as a designer, you need to be very careful

68
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:40,829
with your use of visceral design.

69
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:42,829
Monster closets stop being fun,

70
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:47,851
large explosions stop having the impact that they had,

71
00:03:47,851 --> 00:03:49,932
and the transient.

72
00:03:50,332 --> 00:03:54,514
unpredictable nature of these visceral reactions means that alone they aren't

73
00:03:54,514 --> 00:04:01,477
very good for retention except that they are incredibly important for making

74
00:04:01,477 --> 00:04:07,080
first impressions. So visceral designs can be a crutch that you can use to get

75
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,122
people interested early or to obtain very short-term retention goals like hey

76
00:04:12,122 --> 00:04:17,225
come back the next day while you rely on other methods for longer-term retention.

77
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:26,745
By contrast, game systems are specifically designed to affect the player over long periods.

78
00:04:26,745 --> 00:04:32,429
As time goes on, the systems can affect player emotion, and that can in turn affect their

79
00:04:32,429 --> 00:04:32,969
behavior.

80
00:04:33,923 --> 00:04:36,026
And the really cool thing about game systems

81
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,029
is that they can then respond to those changes,

82
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:42,055
which resets or continues the cycle.

83
00:04:42,055 --> 00:04:43,637
And this sets up a feedback loop,

84
00:04:43,637 --> 00:04:46,501
so the game system actually has the ability

85
00:04:46,501 --> 00:04:51,248
to respond to both behavioral and emotional state changes.

86
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:59,491
As an example, spree systems tend to have very good emotional design.

87
00:04:59,491 --> 00:05:03,973
In many games, including Epic's own Paragon and Unreal Tournament that I have up here,

88
00:05:03,973 --> 00:05:09,315
an announcer will come on and say things like, oh, killing spree or your power grows.

89
00:05:09,315 --> 00:05:14,797
These messages are feedback that communicate how well you're doing in a match, but they

90
00:05:14,797 --> 00:05:16,918
also serve a much larger purpose.

91
00:05:17,528 --> 00:05:20,069
When you're on a spree, your heart rate rises,

92
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,650
that adrenaline starts to pump,

93
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,851
and this is your visceral emotional reaction.

94
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:26,651
And since you're doing well,

95
00:05:26,651 --> 00:05:29,372
you might push the attack on an enemy

96
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:32,553
that you would not have otherwise,

97
00:05:32,553 --> 00:05:33,954
and that is a behavioral reaction.

98
00:05:33,954 --> 00:05:36,615
In fact, by broadcasting your spree

99
00:05:36,615 --> 00:05:38,275
to everyone in the match,

100
00:05:38,275 --> 00:05:41,516
this system can also affect teammates,

101
00:05:41,516 --> 00:05:43,177
maybe by inspiring them,

102
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:45,478
or enemies by intimidating them.

103
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,642
meaning that your killing spree has the potential

104
00:05:49,642 --> 00:05:52,706
to affect everyone's behavior in the entire match.

105
00:05:52,706 --> 00:05:56,131
The system can then respond to that spree

106
00:05:56,131 --> 00:05:57,713
by making you a more high-value target

107
00:05:57,713 --> 00:05:59,455
or various other systems that people use,

108
00:05:59,455 --> 00:06:03,900
which encourages further behavioral and emotional change.

109
00:06:04,926 --> 00:06:14,009
And the design of these systems is so effective that this UltraKill t-shirt has become one of the top selling items in our online store

110
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:21,952
showing that the Spree system is also very reflective, playing into the last of Norman's components for good emotional design

111
00:06:21,952 --> 00:06:27,333
And while these components are all interesting individually

112
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:32,271
It really gets interesting when they start to come together

113
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:34,792
all at the same time in one single design.

114
00:06:34,792 --> 00:06:39,574
And that's what Norman calls providing a emotional context.

115
00:06:39,574 --> 00:06:42,816
If you think about your typical game interaction,

116
00:06:42,816 --> 00:06:45,597
that you start with this kind of physical influence

117
00:06:45,597 --> 00:06:47,998
that's imposed by the input device,

118
00:06:47,998 --> 00:06:50,239
mouse, keyboard, VR helmet, touchscreen,

119
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:51,279
whatever it is that you're using.

120
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:54,541
And that determines the boundaries of what you can do.

121
00:06:55,505 --> 00:06:58,387
But then that logical or rational side of our brain kicks in

122
00:06:58,387 --> 00:07:02,752
and tries to figure out what we should be doing

123
00:07:02,752 --> 00:07:04,133
in the face of those physical limitations.

124
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:08,197
But at an even higher level, what we can do, the physical,

125
00:07:08,197 --> 00:07:11,300
and even what we should do, the rational,

126
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,923
often plays second fiddle to what we want to be doing,

127
00:07:14,923 --> 00:07:17,005
even if we can't explain why.

128
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:25,108
And this is why I think emotional design is so important.

129
00:07:25,108 --> 00:07:28,991
By designing for emotion, we can reach that part of us

130
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:32,653
that is universal to us as human beings

131
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:34,515
and create a lasting impression

132
00:07:34,515 --> 00:07:38,578
that people want to come back for over and over again.

133
00:07:38,578 --> 00:07:41,660
But what does emotional design look like in actual practice

134
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,402
and how does that lead to retention?

135
00:07:48,046 --> 00:07:49,667
Retention can actually manifest itself

136
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:51,148
in a myriad of different ways,

137
00:07:51,148 --> 00:07:54,450
whether it's number of matches played,

138
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:57,411
hours played, or days played in a row.

139
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:59,452
It could be, is the user spending money

140
00:07:59,452 --> 00:08:01,593
or engaging with the game systems,

141
00:08:01,593 --> 00:08:03,755
combinations amongst all of those things.

142
00:08:04,304 --> 00:08:09,287
The one thing that they really have in common is that sense of attachment.

143
00:08:09,287 --> 00:08:12,469
And if you can recall, the purpose of emotional design

144
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:19,352
is to give the user an emotional context that causes them to form attachments.

145
00:08:19,352 --> 00:08:23,074
So I want to go over some of the factors that might influence attachment today

146
00:08:23,074 --> 00:08:26,817
and discuss them alongside some examples from the games that I've worked on.

147
00:08:28,023 --> 00:08:32,126
And the categories I want to talk about in general are memory,

148
00:08:32,126 --> 00:08:35,608
patterns, feedback, and mental models.

149
00:08:35,608 --> 00:08:41,213
First on that list, of course, is memory.

150
00:08:41,213 --> 00:08:44,535
If we can design systems or games

151
00:08:44,535 --> 00:08:46,517
that stay in someone's memory,

152
00:08:46,517 --> 00:08:49,559
they're more likely to be reflective

153
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:53,121
and therefore more likely to retain in the longer term.

154
00:08:54,135 --> 00:08:56,818
but the brain isn't a computer that stores

155
00:08:56,818 --> 00:08:59,662
and retrieves information.

156
00:08:59,662 --> 00:09:03,267
So memories can't just be programmed into them.

157
00:09:03,267 --> 00:09:05,029
We sometimes talk about brains that way.

158
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:10,948
I even do it a lot in this presentation, but that's more just a shorthand that we use.

159
00:09:10,948 --> 00:09:16,650
The reality is that the brain is actually more akin to a system that is affected by

160
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:19,811
and responds to stimuli.

161
00:09:19,811 --> 00:09:27,014
And we are constantly awash in an avalanche of feedback and input from our surroundings,

162
00:09:27,014 --> 00:09:27,534
from everywhere.

163
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:32,657
So the way that we compensate for this is that we filter.

164
00:09:33,768 --> 00:09:36,648
And memory is therefore tied to attention.

165
00:09:36,648 --> 00:09:39,569
Where we choose to focus our attention

166
00:09:39,569 --> 00:09:43,090
affects what we will remember.

167
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:48,931
But attention is, of course, a very limited resource.

168
00:09:48,931 --> 00:09:51,751
And when you're focused on playing a game,

169
00:09:51,751 --> 00:09:53,532
your brain is locked in this battle

170
00:09:53,532 --> 00:09:56,072
to prioritize what's happening in the moment,

171
00:09:56,072 --> 00:09:57,572
what's happening in the story,

172
00:09:57,572 --> 00:09:58,772
what are your short-term goals,

173
00:09:58,772 --> 00:10:00,253
what are your long-term goals.

174
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:07,729
And so the peak-end rule is a very good way to help you determine when is a good time

175
00:10:07,729 --> 00:10:12,735
to try and focus the player's attention so that it has the most lasting potential.

176
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,708
When we look at something that's happened to us,

177
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:20,892
our brains kind of look at how we felt at the peak

178
00:10:20,892 --> 00:10:23,714
and the end of that experience.

179
00:10:23,714 --> 00:10:27,817
And over time, those two points are much more likely

180
00:10:27,817 --> 00:10:29,578
to be the brain's reference

181
00:10:29,578 --> 00:10:32,741
for our overall emotional experience.

182
00:10:32,741 --> 00:10:35,723
So if you can focus on making the peak and the end

183
00:10:35,723 --> 00:10:38,945
the most vivid, the most meaningful to the player,

184
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:41,367
then they become the most available

185
00:10:41,367 --> 00:10:43,268
and lasting to long-term memory.

186
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,965
And this is one of the reasons that people can suffer through extremely difficult encounters,

187
00:10:48,965 --> 00:10:52,348
or long levels, or difficult quest chains,

188
00:10:52,348 --> 00:10:55,731
and still come away from that experience feeling very good.

189
00:10:55,731 --> 00:10:59,734
Quick example from Gears of War.

190
00:10:59,734 --> 00:11:06,160
The sequence shown in this shot was, for many of our players, the peak experience of the game.

191
00:11:06,908 --> 00:11:11,712
There's this cool dramatic intro that led to an extremely difficult combat sequence

192
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:15,555
where we introduced a key new enemy for the first time.

193
00:11:15,555 --> 00:11:18,698
And the line at the end of that intro, which you can see up here,

194
00:11:18,698 --> 00:11:22,361
look at all that juice, was funny, it was memorable,

195
00:11:22,361 --> 00:11:24,582
and it actually did become a meme

196
00:11:24,582 --> 00:11:27,565
that we saw resonating through the internet for a while.

197
00:11:27,565 --> 00:11:31,428
It showed up in other games and forms of achievements and all this other craziness.

198
00:11:31,428 --> 00:11:34,850
And during development, we knew that this was going to be a key moment in the game.

199
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,346
And we didn't want players to miss that funny,

200
00:11:37,346 --> 00:11:38,867
we didn't want them to miss the drama,

201
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:40,929
and we definitely didn't want them to miss

202
00:11:40,929 --> 00:11:42,550
the introduction to this new enemy

203
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,872
because it was a key part of the game.

204
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:46,594
So we decided to put a checkpoint right here.

205
00:11:46,594 --> 00:11:50,397
But that was a very rational decision.

206
00:11:50,397 --> 00:11:53,179
On paper, it sounded smart, it sounded reasonable.

207
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,521
In the end, this actually turned out

208
00:11:55,521 --> 00:11:59,485
to be one of the biggest drop points in the entire game.

209
00:12:00,516 --> 00:12:07,319
Even years later, there is a thread on NeoGAF that discusses games with the worst checkpoints

210
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:08,980
of all time.

211
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,021
And you can guess what that thread is called.

212
00:12:12,021 --> 00:12:13,201
Look at all that juice.

213
00:12:13,201 --> 00:12:19,224
This sequence had a very strong rational design, but poor emotional design.

214
00:12:19,942 --> 00:12:24,467
It showed no empathy for players stuck in a very difficult part of the game,

215
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:28,151
and no respect for their time as they had to repeat this over and over

216
00:12:28,151 --> 00:12:31,294
and walk through this long sequence and watch that same cinematic

217
00:12:31,294 --> 00:12:34,938
and go through that same fight every single time they died.

218
00:12:34,938 --> 00:12:39,963
And my favorite post in that thread says,

219
00:12:39,963 --> 00:12:43,586
it's amazing that game designers still don't get things like that.

220
00:12:43,973 --> 00:12:48,836
And they're right, because it's so easy for us to rationalize a poor decision

221
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:51,658
and forget the power of emotional design.

222
00:12:51,658 --> 00:12:57,461
Compare that to a more recent example that we're working on in our game Fortnite.

223
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:03,780
Instead of generic loot crates, Fortnite uses llama pinatas.

224
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,040
And as one does with a pinata,

225
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,840
the way you open it is to beat it with a stick.

226
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:12,021
So there's this really strong affordance for hitting it,

227
00:13:12,021 --> 00:13:14,702
which is a very strong visceral reaction.

228
00:13:14,702 --> 00:13:17,582
And when you pull back and you're about to unleash

229
00:13:17,582 --> 00:13:21,143
your attack, at the peak of this experience,

230
00:13:21,143 --> 00:13:24,504
the llama reacts, inciting a behavioral response from you,

231
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,024
because now you want to hit it even harder.

232
00:13:26,963 --> 00:13:30,266
Or maybe you feel sorry for it, whatever your deal is there.

233
00:13:30,266 --> 00:13:34,829
The pinata theme, the actions, and of course,

234
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:37,551
the end result, getting all the loot,

235
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:40,413
help players remember that it's more than just a loot crate,

236
00:13:40,413 --> 00:13:43,055
making an experience that players reflect on.

237
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:45,237
But opening this thing is a really long sequence,

238
00:13:45,237 --> 00:13:48,940
and you have to use this broom to clean up

239
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,441
all the pieces at the end.

240
00:13:51,878 --> 00:13:54,720
and you do it pretty regularly every time you earn something,

241
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,281
but then up in the top right, there's also a fast-forward button

242
00:13:57,281 --> 00:14:00,243
that shows empathy and respect for the player's time.

243
00:14:00,243 --> 00:14:05,485
Now, each of these sequences from the two games are memorable,

244
00:14:05,485 --> 00:14:06,746
but for opposite reasons,

245
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:09,227
both insight and emotional response from the player,

246
00:14:09,227 --> 00:14:14,210
but Gears does it in a way that pushes the player out of the game experience,

247
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:18,032
and it takes their attention away from what they're actually trying to do.

248
00:14:18,995 --> 00:14:21,517
while Fortnite grabs the player's attention

249
00:14:21,517 --> 00:14:25,060
at the peak and the end of the experience,

250
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,063
focuses on the positive emotional context,

251
00:14:28,063 --> 00:14:31,886
and creates a lasting memory that you want to do this

252
00:14:31,886 --> 00:14:33,287
over and over again.

253
00:14:33,287 --> 00:14:37,631
And that's important because memory is biased

254
00:14:37,631 --> 00:14:39,172
toward these emotional events.

255
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:39,492
Now,

256
00:14:43,434 --> 00:14:49,199
The easiest and most obvious way to capture someone's attention is through the use of simplicity.

257
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:57,207
Simplicity means focus. Simplicity means elegance. Simplicity means clarity.

258
00:14:57,207 --> 00:15:04,975
And when done well, simplicity has a real emotional power, and that alone can be quite memorable.

259
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,321
And I know that talking about simplicity

260
00:15:10,321 --> 00:15:11,801
with a group of designers,

261
00:15:11,801 --> 00:15:13,702
which I saw many of you were when we started this,

262
00:15:13,702 --> 00:15:15,824
it's like this basic design concept

263
00:15:15,824 --> 00:15:18,385
that you're all like, yes, I understand that.

264
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:20,906
But again, that's very rational thinking.

265
00:15:20,906 --> 00:15:23,848
In actual practice, you know there's always that executive

266
00:15:23,848 --> 00:15:25,329
who wants you to add a monster to the door

267
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:26,730
because it'll look scarier, right?

268
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,411
And then the art director comes in

269
00:15:28,411 --> 00:15:30,412
and wants you to add some better shaders

270
00:15:30,412 --> 00:15:31,392
and some other elements

271
00:15:31,392 --> 00:15:33,493
to really show off their cool art techniques.

272
00:15:34,387 --> 00:15:37,728
And even just these small differences are striking.

273
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,149
I mean, that image went from something

274
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:42,070
that you were staring at silently

275
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,111
to I hear people giggling, right?

276
00:15:43,111 --> 00:15:45,752
Simplicity has become complexity.

277
00:15:45,752 --> 00:15:50,855
And that really detracts from that overall visceral component

278
00:15:50,855 --> 00:15:53,676
that you originally had with the simple image.

279
00:15:53,676 --> 00:15:57,118
So as a designer, you need to be able to find a way

280
00:15:57,118 --> 00:16:00,119
to compromise in a way that doesn't sacrifice

281
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:02,160
that important component of your design.

282
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:08,981
Without that emotional pull, the player isn't likely to notice the things that you want them to focus on,

283
00:16:08,981 --> 00:16:13,622
which means they're less likely to remember, so they're less likely to retain.

284
00:16:13,622 --> 00:16:21,825
Stories are also a very important component to memory. This doll was part of a research

285
00:16:21,825 --> 00:16:28,087
study called the Significant Objects Project. Researchers bought it just randomly off of eBay

286
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:28,867
for three dollars.

287
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:31,749
And then they made up a background story about it,

288
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:34,711
about how it was infused with the spirit of the dollmaker,

289
00:16:34,711 --> 00:16:37,753
and on moonless nights, it would come alive

290
00:16:37,753 --> 00:16:38,833
and dance in the streets.

291
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,794
It was a complete fantasy,

292
00:16:40,794 --> 00:16:43,255
but then they put the doll back on eBay.

293
00:16:43,255 --> 00:16:47,598
But instead of selling for $3, the original purchase price,

294
00:16:47,598 --> 00:16:49,218
it now sold for almost $200.

295
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:55,001
The story made the buyers think about the doll.

296
00:16:55,001 --> 00:16:57,403
It became significantly more reflective.

297
00:16:58,326 --> 00:17:06,128
And stories lead to attachment because they create actual connections and associations in our brain,

298
00:17:06,128 --> 00:17:14,811
actual measurable physical changes. And this is why in Paragon we include very simple, very vague

299
00:17:14,811 --> 00:17:21,213
stories, background stories about each of our characters. The story encourages players to

300
00:17:21,213 --> 00:17:24,914
think about the hero, to form an association with him,

301
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:28,400
And then as they start to play, their own personal story

302
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,762
gets all mixed up with the character's background story

303
00:17:31,762 --> 00:17:33,762
and the two start to merge.

304
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:36,343
And because those stories are physically

305
00:17:36,343 --> 00:17:38,004
part of our players' memories,

306
00:17:38,004 --> 00:17:40,545
they're more likely therefore to stick with playing them

307
00:17:40,545 --> 00:17:42,306
and to become attached to them,

308
00:17:42,306 --> 00:17:43,846
therefore retaining over longer periods of time.

309
00:17:43,846 --> 00:17:45,407
In Fortnite, bacon is used for healing.

310
00:17:45,407 --> 00:17:46,548
And sometimes it can be found in toilets.

311
00:17:55,681 --> 00:18:01,768
Now this decision to create toilet bacon was actually pretty deliberate.

312
00:18:01,768 --> 00:18:06,212
First off, bacon heals you. It's also delicious.

313
00:18:06,212 --> 00:18:09,436
So it serves a useful purpose that benefits you.

314
00:18:09,436 --> 00:18:13,901
Therefore, it fulfills that behavioral component.

315
00:18:13,901 --> 00:18:17,164
And when a a new

316
00:18:17,787 --> 00:18:23,068
item comes in your inventory like hey this this thing equals health it lights

317
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:27,949
up pathways in your brain that are associated with cognition and learning

318
00:18:27,949 --> 00:18:35,231
but when that item is also something like coffee or in this case bacon it'll

319
00:18:35,231 --> 00:18:39,052
also light up the pathways that are associated with your olfactory response

320
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:45,134
and that is something that is will give you a very instant visceral reaction as

321
00:18:45,134 --> 00:18:45,394
well

322
00:18:47,153 --> 00:18:50,655
So in addition to bacon, you have another

323
00:18:50,655 --> 00:18:53,997
and hopefully different, but just as strong association

324
00:18:53,997 --> 00:18:54,838
to the word toilet.

325
00:18:54,838 --> 00:18:57,519
And we now have these two concepts

326
00:18:57,519 --> 00:18:59,861
where you have an attachment to both of them,

327
00:18:59,861 --> 00:19:03,403
and we've created a link between them.

328
00:19:03,403 --> 00:19:05,505
Your brain knows them, your body knows them,

329
00:19:05,505 --> 00:19:08,667
so they're really easy targets for our emotional design.

330
00:19:09,922 --> 00:19:14,243
And lastly, bacon is actually a very rare find in Fortnite.

331
00:19:14,243 --> 00:19:16,624
So when it pops out of a toilet, it's surprising,

332
00:19:16,624 --> 00:19:20,466
it's funny, it grabs your attention at a peak moment,

333
00:19:20,466 --> 00:19:22,367
and it's memorable.

334
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:25,348
So it creates a story that you want to share.

335
00:19:25,348 --> 00:19:27,269
It's therefore become reflective.

336
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:29,490
And all of these components combine

337
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:32,311
to create a strong emotional design

338
00:19:32,311 --> 00:19:34,312
that is more likely to retain players.

339
00:19:34,312 --> 00:19:34,612
And lastly,

340
00:19:38,855 --> 00:19:41,815
Memory is important to retention because the emotional

341
00:19:41,815 --> 00:19:46,497
connections that it creates can be very, very enduring.

342
00:19:46,497 --> 00:19:50,498
If you think about the most recent Doom game that came out,

343
00:19:50,498 --> 00:19:51,758
when you look at it in isolation,

344
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:54,139
that multiplayer beta that came out first,

345
00:19:54,139 --> 00:19:55,899
it was a pretty cool experience,

346
00:19:55,899 --> 00:19:58,780
but critically, it was panned,

347
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,201
and the community started to get out their pitchforks

348
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:04,942
because it didn't feel like the Doom of their memory.

349
00:20:06,385 --> 00:20:10,612
Then a few weeks later, the single player campaign comes out and all of a sudden, bam,

350
00:20:10,612 --> 00:20:16,040
this game is a major hit because that single player component of the game matched very

351
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,546
well with the player's memories of the past Doom games.

352
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:24,156
That original doom is now ancient by video game standards,

353
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,558
but the memories that you have from playing it

354
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,119
will last you a lifetime.

355
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:31,121
And whether or not that game actually holds up

356
00:20:31,121 --> 00:20:33,702
by modern standards is irrelevant

357
00:20:33,702 --> 00:20:35,804
as long as the new game that is built

358
00:20:35,804 --> 00:20:39,126
on those modern standard measures up to your memories.

359
00:20:39,126 --> 00:20:42,188
And if it does, that means that players

360
00:20:42,188 --> 00:20:44,730
are more likely to keep playing.

361
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:50,467
So if we can grab the player's attention,

362
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:52,267
focus it at the right time and place,

363
00:20:52,267 --> 00:20:54,227
and let it develop into something

364
00:20:54,227 --> 00:20:57,348
that they can actually associate their own personal stories

365
00:20:57,348 --> 00:20:59,669
and personal emotional context to,

366
00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:03,530
then we can create a design that stays in someone's memory

367
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,830
and they're more likely to retain.

368
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,150
Okay, next component I'd like to focus on is patterns.

369
00:21:15,961 --> 00:21:18,784
Patterns help us establish a sense of continuity.

370
00:21:18,784 --> 00:21:21,787
Instead of action leading to reward,

371
00:21:21,787 --> 00:21:24,631
you can also get reward that leads to further action.

372
00:21:24,631 --> 00:21:28,475
Every endpoint becomes a new starting point

373
00:21:28,475 --> 00:21:30,357
for the continuity of the pattern.

374
00:21:30,357 --> 00:21:33,480
And this helps us form habits,

375
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,043
and habits lead to retention.

376
00:21:37,787 --> 00:21:40,508
Take a moment and think about social media that you use,

377
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:43,590
whether it's Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, whatever.

378
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:46,131
Now I highly doubt that you can recall

379
00:21:46,131 --> 00:21:48,932
every single time you've ever logged into Facebook

380
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,573
and checked a post.

381
00:21:50,573 --> 00:21:54,275
I bet you can barely remember what you did yesterday.

382
00:21:54,275 --> 00:21:57,016
But just me mentioning it, I'd also be willing to bet

383
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:59,158
that several of you have itchy hands

384
00:21:59,158 --> 00:22:00,818
that want to reach for your phones.

385
00:22:00,818 --> 00:22:03,960
Because that pattern of daily use

386
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,982
has turned into a habit or ritual behavior.

387
00:22:08,395 --> 00:22:14,701
Rain Man is a great reminder that experiences that develop from patterns are also much more

388
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:19,466
memorable. I just finished talking about how memory is important to retention, and this is

389
00:22:19,466 --> 00:22:25,072
because repetition is a key component of the process that helps us encode information and

390
00:22:25,072 --> 00:22:30,117
move it from short-term to long-term memory. Yes, Ben, wherever you are, I know that's shorthand

391
00:22:30,117 --> 00:22:31,858
for not what actually what happens.

392
00:22:33,626 --> 00:22:39,632
But this is why games offer daily rewards, timed rewards, or notification systems that

393
00:22:39,632 --> 00:22:42,214
invite you back as often as possible.

394
00:22:42,214 --> 00:22:47,279
Some even have significant components to their game that require ritual visitation in order

395
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:48,760
for the player to be successful.

396
00:22:49,448 --> 00:22:55,372
These types of patterns set up strong, short and long-term goals

397
00:22:55,372 --> 00:22:58,074
and help players track their progress.

398
00:22:58,074 --> 00:23:00,355
Log in tomorrow and get a reward.

399
00:23:00,355 --> 00:23:02,676
Gain one more level and you'll get a custom skin.

400
00:23:02,676 --> 00:23:07,059
The more you come back, the better you become.

401
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:11,522
And the more you're building more of those physical connections in your brain

402
00:23:11,522 --> 00:23:16,585
that make it easier for you to access the memories associated with the game.

403
00:23:19,052 --> 00:23:22,154
Streamers also rely on ritual behavior

404
00:23:22,154 --> 00:23:24,275
to enhance their viewer retention rates.

405
00:23:24,275 --> 00:23:27,156
If you watch Hearthstone or Paragon streams,

406
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:29,998
they'll take the simple process of opening a card pack

407
00:23:29,998 --> 00:23:31,798
and draw it out.

408
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:34,560
There's a whole button there that says reveal all

409
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,161
and they all ignore it.

410
00:23:36,161 --> 00:23:39,362
They'll hover over each of the cards individually

411
00:23:39,362 --> 00:23:40,403
to find out their rarity.

412
00:23:40,403 --> 00:23:42,764
And then they'll start with the most common card

413
00:23:42,764 --> 00:23:46,686
and work their way up slowly to the big reveal at the end.

414
00:23:47,488 --> 00:23:50,950
There's no rules that say you need to open card packs this way,

415
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:55,312
and yet in almost every single instance on YouTube and Twitch that you'll find,

416
00:23:55,312 --> 00:23:58,054
people do it in this exact same way.

417
00:23:58,054 --> 00:24:01,696
They follow these patterns because they know it's likely to grab your attention

418
00:24:01,696 --> 00:24:03,657
and burn into your memory.

419
00:24:03,657 --> 00:24:06,659
They're betting on the fact that their patterned behavior

420
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:08,920
will lead to better viewer retention.

421
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,102
And if you want to develop this kind of ritual behavior,

422
00:24:12,102 --> 00:24:16,885
you need to give your player repeatable actions.

423
00:24:17,738 --> 00:24:21,600
This is the entire foundation for Paragon.

424
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,021
You load into a game, you select an ability,

425
00:24:24,021 --> 00:24:26,081
you select a deck, you add a card,

426
00:24:26,081 --> 00:24:27,622
and you set off to lane.

427
00:24:27,622 --> 00:24:31,583
It's the same sequence and it repeats every time you play.

428
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:34,244
The game is separated into a pregame phase,

429
00:24:34,244 --> 00:24:37,365
laning phase, a mid game, a late game.

430
00:24:37,365 --> 00:24:39,806
Every phase is a pattern of its own

431
00:24:39,806 --> 00:24:42,226
and repetition builds memory.

432
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:49,658
After the match, you see the reward screens, you upgrade your deck, and then you head back

433
00:24:49,658 --> 00:24:51,599
in and start all over again.

434
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:57,404
Every aspect of the game is a pattern that induces ritual behavior that makes players

435
00:24:57,404 --> 00:24:59,025
want to come back for more.

436
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:04,701
I was too big of a chicken to get video, but here's a character that's fighting some AI

437
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:05,182
minions.

438
00:25:05,182 --> 00:25:10,143
And when you see them in game, the speed of the animations and the sound that it creates

439
00:25:10,143 --> 00:25:13,484
is a very strong pattern.

440
00:25:13,484 --> 00:25:18,165
It establishes a rhythm that lets the player know exactly how long they can stand in this

441
00:25:18,165 --> 00:25:19,985
one spot before they're going to die.

442
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:25,428
It also allows them to pattern match against the countdown on their ability timer,

443
00:25:25,428 --> 00:25:29,131
so they know when those are going to be available,

444
00:25:29,131 --> 00:25:31,712
and how long until another enemy is going to spawn in that location,

445
00:25:31,712 --> 00:25:37,116
and all sorts of various other components all fit into the same pattern.

446
00:25:37,116 --> 00:25:41,959
And by intentionally creating patterns like this,

447
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:45,081
we help players understand the game better,

448
00:25:45,081 --> 00:25:49,664
and they start to develop these ritual behaviors of their own.

449
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:57,045
The constant feedback-repeating loop of action and reward is visceral. It drives its players

450
00:25:57,045 --> 00:26:02,490
to think, oh, if I stay here, I'll get just one more point, just one more try, hey, just one more

451
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:09,778
match. So it's become behavioral. Ritual behaviors become ingrained in our memory, so you tend to

452
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:12,580
think about them even when you're not playing the game.

453
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,540
They're reflective.

454
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:18,022
Each of these components drives you to play more,

455
00:26:18,022 --> 00:26:23,044
to play again, leading to better retention over time.

456
00:26:23,044 --> 00:26:26,366
Patterns also help us to establish muscle memory.

457
00:26:26,366 --> 00:26:28,667
Paragon uses a series of key presses

458
00:26:28,667 --> 00:26:30,628
for quick communication in game.

459
00:26:30,628 --> 00:26:31,988
In here, you hit left, right, right,

460
00:26:31,988 --> 00:26:34,029
and it says, hey, good job.

461
00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:37,951
Now, I would really have to strain and think about it

462
00:26:37,951 --> 00:26:40,833
to tell you how to say in game,

463
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,313
I'm on my way to left lane,

464
00:26:42,313 --> 00:26:42,493
or...

465
00:26:42,991 --> 00:26:44,832
hey, I need help in mid lane.

466
00:26:44,832 --> 00:26:48,055
But the point is that when I'm playing,

467
00:26:48,055 --> 00:26:50,377
I don't actually need to think about it anymore.

468
00:26:50,377 --> 00:26:52,578
My fingers know these patterns automatically

469
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:54,520
after hours and hours of patterning.

470
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,222
Now, of course, just going through the motions

471
00:26:57,222 --> 00:26:59,164
and doing a pattern doesn't mean

472
00:26:59,164 --> 00:27:00,645
that they're going to stick.

473
00:27:00,645 --> 00:27:03,447
That pattern also has to be meaningful.

474
00:27:04,203 --> 00:27:09,367
And significantly, these messages are more than just a somatic pattern.

475
00:27:09,367 --> 00:27:12,509
They're used, again, as a reward mechanism.

476
00:27:12,509 --> 00:27:16,712
Good job pops up across the server when anyone on your team gets a kill

477
00:27:16,712 --> 00:27:17,913
or takes down a tower.

478
00:27:17,913 --> 00:27:21,575
I send these messages to other people that I'm playing with,

479
00:27:21,575 --> 00:27:24,818
even if I'm in the same room with them and could have easily just said it out loud

480
00:27:24,818 --> 00:27:27,240
because it's become an automatic motion.

481
00:27:28,375 --> 00:27:31,320
And when complex actions become second nature,

482
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,043
like these messages,

483
00:27:33,043 --> 00:27:35,907
it can reduce the overall cognitive load

484
00:27:35,907 --> 00:27:38,832
that helps with enjoyment and of course, retention.

485
00:27:40,568 --> 00:27:44,031
Now patterns don't have to be a collection of movements

486
00:27:44,031 --> 00:27:45,511
or a collection of moments,

487
00:27:45,511 --> 00:27:49,914
and they aren't limited just to player actions and behaviors.

488
00:27:49,914 --> 00:27:51,895
Here's an example from Unreal Tournament,

489
00:27:51,895 --> 00:27:54,617
which is a game that has tons of different weapons.

490
00:27:54,617 --> 00:27:56,538
Each weapon has two, sometimes three,

491
00:27:56,538 --> 00:27:59,199
sometimes even four different firing modes.

492
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:00,520
It's a lot to learn.

493
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,281
And in a game that's really fast-paced,

494
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:04,583
it's also really difficult to keep up with

495
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:05,763
and understand what's happening.

496
00:28:06,653 --> 00:28:13,999
So to get over this, we originally tried to give every firing mode for every weapon a unique rhythm,

497
00:28:13,999 --> 00:28:19,683
and then assign each of those to a specific time signature and musical key.

498
00:28:19,683 --> 00:28:25,948
So the link gun you see is actually a 4-4 beat, and then the sniper rifle is a 6-8 beat,

499
00:28:25,948 --> 00:28:28,090
so it does a longer and then a reload.

500
00:28:30,577 --> 00:28:32,538
flat cannons 2-4, rocket launcher was 3-4,

501
00:28:32,538 --> 00:28:35,879
I mean these patterned through all of our weapons.

502
00:28:35,879 --> 00:28:38,301
This made them easier to use

503
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:42,103
because the recognizable patterns allowed players

504
00:28:42,103 --> 00:28:44,864
to predict the firing state of an enemy,

505
00:28:44,864 --> 00:28:47,585
to understand the length of their reloads,

506
00:28:47,585 --> 00:28:50,147
and time the button presses on their shots.

507
00:28:50,147 --> 00:28:53,508
And best of all, this requires no effort

508
00:28:53,508 --> 00:28:54,789
on the part of the player.

509
00:28:55,282 --> 00:28:58,545
because it's affecting them at an unconscious, emotional level.

510
00:28:58,545 --> 00:29:02,129
These patterns exist purely to help the player,

511
00:29:02,129 --> 00:29:04,952
but from their perspective, they're not being helped,

512
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:06,254
they're just playing the game better.

513
00:29:06,254 --> 00:29:08,616
And since they feel more successful,

514
00:29:08,616 --> 00:29:11,159
they experience growth and progression,

515
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:14,203
which means they're more likely to come back and try for more.

516
00:29:16,712 --> 00:29:19,854
Social patterns are very important to retention.

517
00:29:19,854 --> 00:29:21,555
This could be an entire talk of its own.

518
00:29:21,555 --> 00:29:23,616
I don't have time to go into everything today,

519
00:29:23,616 --> 00:29:26,398
but just as a brief summary, I wanted to go over them

520
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:30,060
because they can be so incredibly compelling.

521
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,822
Whether people are in a guild or a clan

522
00:29:32,822 --> 00:29:35,864
or whatever your game's social group is,

523
00:29:35,864 --> 00:29:38,525
or even if they're just playing as part of a team.

524
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:43,152
that social structure itself leads to increased engagement.

525
00:29:43,152 --> 00:29:45,493
Congregate is a mobile publisher,

526
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:51,136
they released this data a while back that shows that more than half of

527
00:29:51,136 --> 00:29:54,698
their revenue comes from 0.5 percent of

528
00:29:54,698 --> 00:29:58,080
the population that has played their game for more than 500 hours.

529
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,382
Every single one of their top 10 games has a guild,

530
00:30:02,382 --> 00:30:06,244
and guild players spend 10 times more than non-guild players.

531
00:30:06,953 --> 00:30:09,073
Among the people who do spend money,

532
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:12,994
guild players spend three times more than people who aren't in a guild.

533
00:30:12,994 --> 00:30:15,634
Most relevant to today's talk,

534
00:30:15,634 --> 00:30:19,555
social ties led to an increase in engagement.

535
00:30:19,555 --> 00:30:23,416
Players in social groups spend more money,

536
00:30:23,416 --> 00:30:26,356
they play longer, and they play deeper.

537
00:30:26,356 --> 00:30:28,536
They retain much, much better.

538
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:32,897
We saw the same effect when we introduced co-op to Gears of War

539
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:34,958
and our Unreal series,

540
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,378
especially when we hit...

541
00:30:37,363 --> 00:30:42,425
horde mode, led to huge gains in player retention for us

542
00:30:42,425 --> 00:30:46,106
because we created a social pattern.

543
00:30:46,106 --> 00:30:47,926
Co-op game types encourage repeat play

544
00:30:47,926 --> 00:30:50,027
because every time you go to play,

545
00:30:50,027 --> 00:30:51,407
you're with a different group

546
00:30:51,407 --> 00:30:53,888
and you're gonna have a different experience.

547
00:30:53,888 --> 00:30:57,069
And if you didn't do so well this time,

548
00:30:57,069 --> 00:30:58,170
try again with a different group.

549
00:30:59,289 --> 00:31:03,093
Cooperation is also more motivating and rewarding

550
00:31:03,093 --> 00:31:06,317
than competition because the social connections

551
00:31:06,317 --> 00:31:09,100
create a sense of belonging and a sense of duty.

552
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,723
They give you a reason to stick around and keep playing

553
00:31:11,723 --> 00:31:14,427
because you don't want to leave and hurt your team.

554
00:31:17,595 --> 00:31:21,176
Another really important social pattern in games is gifting.

555
00:31:21,176 --> 00:31:25,397
Gifts help us establish positive emotional responses

556
00:31:25,397 --> 00:31:29,218
from players and, thanks to our lovely human nature,

557
00:31:29,218 --> 00:31:30,779
feelings of reciprocity.

558
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:35,941
A gift serves as a reminder of the person who gave it to you.

559
00:31:35,941 --> 00:31:37,981
It starts setting up a relationship

560
00:31:37,981 --> 00:31:42,743
with that other person, and it encourages you to respond.

561
00:31:42,743 --> 00:31:46,584
This reciprocal pattern of behavior leads to engagement.

562
00:31:47,393 --> 00:31:49,915
in our new mobile game, which was just announced this morning,

563
00:31:49,915 --> 00:31:50,917
Battle Breakers.

564
00:31:50,917 --> 00:31:51,357
Go play it.

565
00:31:51,357 --> 00:31:54,600
The more engaged you are, the more you participate

566
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,203
in daily activities, the better your gifts

567
00:31:57,203 --> 00:31:58,765
are for your friends.

568
00:31:58,765 --> 00:32:01,548
And this fosters a sense of social engagement

569
00:32:01,548 --> 00:32:04,611
and rewards players and their friends

570
00:32:04,611 --> 00:32:06,493
for the investment of their time, which

571
00:32:06,493 --> 00:32:10,637
encourages them to come back and return that favor again for you.

572
00:32:13,887 --> 00:32:18,628
You can also create social patterns by adding friends lists to your game.

573
00:32:18,628 --> 00:32:23,250
I mean, have you ever been compelled to accept a friend request from someone who you've never actually met?

574
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:29,712
And when you send a friend's request, isn't there an automatic expectation that whoever you send it to is going to reply?

575
00:32:29,712 --> 00:32:36,375
Social networking is all about that expectation that there is a pattern there and that it will continue.

576
00:32:37,335 --> 00:32:40,798
So we carry on every day trying to build relationships

577
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:46,042
and collect friends and likes and followers on social media.

578
00:32:46,042 --> 00:32:51,747
And we report our status with people who in reality,

579
00:32:51,747 --> 00:32:52,908
we have no actual relationship with.

580
00:32:52,908 --> 00:32:55,790
But we tend to think that we do.

581
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:58,613
And that ever important emotional context

582
00:32:58,613 --> 00:33:01,155
motivates us to continue to come back

583
00:33:01,155 --> 00:33:03,176
again and again and again.

584
00:33:04,147 --> 00:33:06,328
And the key takeaway I want people to get here

585
00:33:06,328 --> 00:33:07,930
is that when you're designing patterns,

586
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:11,332
consider not only how they affect player behavior,

587
00:33:11,332 --> 00:33:15,456
but also how they could impact player relationships.

588
00:33:15,456 --> 00:33:19,038
Because relationships provide a much larger

589
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:23,082
emotional context that can dramatically improve retention.

590
00:33:24,835 --> 00:33:28,417
One final, one word of caution before moving on from patterns.

591
00:33:28,417 --> 00:33:31,079
Once a pattern is established, you

592
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:34,361
have to be very careful about breaking it or interrupting it.

593
00:33:34,361 --> 00:33:37,663
There were times in Gears where we wanted to create a very

594
00:33:37,663 --> 00:33:40,064
impactful moment, like this scene here,

595
00:33:40,064 --> 00:33:43,486
where Dom visits the grave of his wife,

596
00:33:43,486 --> 00:33:46,547
who he had to euthanize after she had

597
00:33:46,547 --> 00:33:49,569
been tortured and lobotomized.

598
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,430
Gears is a fun place.

599
00:33:52,105 --> 00:33:54,347
We really wanted this scene to have weight,

600
00:33:54,347 --> 00:33:55,808
to build up those feels in the player,

601
00:33:55,808 --> 00:33:59,450
and watching this sequence develop in our daily stand-ups,

602
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,851
we were really happy with the way it was coming together.

603
00:34:01,851 --> 00:34:04,033
We finally get it in game, and there's Dom,

604
00:34:04,033 --> 00:34:07,695
kneeling next to the grave, saying his final goodbye.

605
00:34:07,695 --> 00:34:10,436
And then he stands up right afterwards,

606
00:34:10,436 --> 00:34:12,277
runs into combat, and starts yelling,

607
00:34:12,277 --> 00:34:15,459
this is gonna be awesome, oh yeah!

608
00:34:15,459 --> 00:34:15,519
Now.

609
00:34:17,645 --> 00:34:20,787
These were his dynamically generated combat scenes,

610
00:34:20,787 --> 00:34:25,011
which were playing as designed by our combat system,

611
00:34:25,011 --> 00:34:28,754
but contextually were really, really wrong.

612
00:34:28,754 --> 00:34:33,477
And the inclusion of this emotional scene

613
00:34:33,477 --> 00:34:36,260
broke that established pattern of combat.

614
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:41,184
And it was so obvious that it made this scene with Dom

615
00:34:41,184 --> 00:34:43,305
comical instead of impactful.

616
00:34:43,305 --> 00:34:46,148
It was really bad emotional design.

617
00:34:47,408 --> 00:34:50,412
So of course we ended up modifying the system before we shipped

618
00:34:50,412 --> 00:34:52,354
so that we had a series of switches

619
00:34:52,354 --> 00:34:54,456
that would filter out specific lines

620
00:34:54,456 --> 00:34:58,902
in areas where we wanted to maintain an emotional momentum

621
00:34:58,902 --> 00:35:03,007
and to do it in a way that was so seamless to the player

622
00:35:03,007 --> 00:35:07,292
that it didn't interrupt that pattern of their emotional context.

623
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:12,170
Patterns have a significant impact

624
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:14,632
on the player's perception of your game.

625
00:35:14,632 --> 00:35:19,096
They determine that sense of pacing and flow.

626
00:35:19,096 --> 00:35:21,399
Repetition helps us build memories,

627
00:35:21,399 --> 00:35:25,563
and the consistency of action, feedback,

628
00:35:25,563 --> 00:35:29,186
and reward and expectation help players set goals

629
00:35:29,186 --> 00:35:31,008
and find meaning in your game,

630
00:35:31,008 --> 00:35:33,330
which can dramatically improve retention.

631
00:35:38,347 --> 00:35:40,308
All right, signs and feedback.

632
00:35:40,308 --> 00:35:44,590
Good feedback is obviously essential to UX,

633
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,031
especially in game design.

634
00:35:46,031 --> 00:35:48,692
This is one of the biggest

635
00:35:48,692 --> 00:35:50,833
do not miss opportunities for any designer.

636
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:55,456
Feedback is vital for clarity, communication,

637
00:35:55,456 --> 00:35:57,237
and successful pattern recognition.

638
00:35:57,237 --> 00:35:59,898
The player has to know what state they're in

639
00:35:59,898 --> 00:36:02,219
if you expect them to respond.

640
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:03,100
Can they attack?

641
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,920
Should they move?

642
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,761
How should they react?

643
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:12,011
Now we experience emotion as a direct and immediate result

644
00:36:12,011 --> 00:36:13,931
of our interaction with the world.

645
00:36:13,931 --> 00:36:18,372
So feedback needs to be just as immediate and crystal clear.

646
00:36:18,372 --> 00:36:21,753
We took this to the extreme in Gears.

647
00:36:21,753 --> 00:36:24,714
We focused on explosions with deep audio,

648
00:36:24,714 --> 00:36:27,775
visual effects that really kind of shook you to your core.

649
00:36:27,775 --> 00:36:30,795
We spent weeks working on just how much the screen

650
00:36:30,795 --> 00:36:31,916
would shake while you were running

651
00:36:31,916 --> 00:36:34,196
and the feedback that you would get

652
00:36:34,196 --> 00:36:35,437
when you were locked in a chainsaw duel.

653
00:36:36,383 --> 00:36:41,906
In Gears, you don't just get into cover, you slam into cover, and dust crumbles off the wall,

654
00:36:41,906 --> 00:36:47,468
and you hear the character grimace, and you can see the expression on their face.

655
00:36:47,468 --> 00:36:54,070
And that feedback helps the player feel the game experience in a very visceral way.

656
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:57,571
In Paragon, we do very much the same thing.

657
00:36:58,402 --> 00:37:01,464
Whether it's launching a meteor or the impact against a shield,

658
00:37:01,464 --> 00:37:05,487
we do our best to ensure that this conflict is felt,

659
00:37:05,487 --> 00:37:07,208
not just seen or heard.

660
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:11,150
In a lot of our marketing, like this image here,

661
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:14,372
Gideon pulls a meteor out of a dimensional rift

662
00:37:14,372 --> 00:37:17,474
and slams it down into the enemy.

663
00:37:17,474 --> 00:37:20,296
But in the actual game, he actually

664
00:37:20,296 --> 00:37:24,119
launches a series of small meteors consecutively

665
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,640
instead of just the one big one.

666
00:37:26,847 --> 00:37:29,710
And we tried to rationalize that decision by telling our players

667
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:34,874
that the small meteors actually did more damage over a larger area,

668
00:37:34,874 --> 00:37:37,936
so it was actually a more effective way to attack.

669
00:37:37,936 --> 00:37:41,439
But from that visceral, emotional point of view,

670
00:37:41,439 --> 00:37:43,961
our players were still very disappointed.

671
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:49,025
So we switched it to be a meteor, one big meteor, just like in that image.

672
00:37:49,932 --> 00:37:52,414
And sure enough, right when we did that,

673
00:37:52,414 --> 00:37:54,916
the use of Gideon in Paragon spiked.

674
00:37:54,916 --> 00:37:59,340
He almost instantly became one of the most popular heroes

675
00:37:59,340 --> 00:37:59,840
in the game.

676
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,664
It's also important to note that at the same time

677
00:38:03,664 --> 00:38:06,606
we did this, we actually nerfed his abilities.

678
00:38:06,606 --> 00:38:09,749
So if you look at his win rate over that same period,

679
00:38:09,749 --> 00:38:13,672
it actually stays pretty consistent.

680
00:38:13,672 --> 00:38:17,715
He didn't actually get any better by any metric.

681
00:38:19,071 --> 00:38:23,515
But we improved retention by changing the game's effects

682
00:38:23,515 --> 00:38:28,399
in a way that provided better emotional feedback

683
00:38:28,399 --> 00:38:28,739
for our players.

684
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:31,682
Feedback doesn't always need to be physical

685
00:38:31,682 --> 00:38:36,946
or even really obvious in order to be effective.

686
00:38:36,946 --> 00:38:39,809
Paragon uses these absolutely insane shaders

687
00:38:39,809 --> 00:38:40,950
for skin and hair.

688
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:45,533
We have eyes that can actually dilate in response to light.

689
00:38:45,533 --> 00:38:47,295
It's completely over the top.

690
00:38:48,265 --> 00:38:52,587
but it makes our characters feel that much more human.

691
00:38:52,587 --> 00:38:56,589
And as humans, we're hardwired to react to another human

692
00:38:56,589 --> 00:38:59,730
differently than we would to a game character.

693
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:04,472
And if the player's brain reacts to this character

694
00:39:04,472 --> 00:39:06,533
as it would to another human,

695
00:39:06,533 --> 00:39:09,014
instead of reacting to it like it would

696
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:11,135
a collection of painted polygons,

697
00:39:11,135 --> 00:39:12,656
there's a much higher chance

698
00:39:12,656 --> 00:39:14,997
that they'll form that emotional connection.

699
00:39:15,903 --> 00:39:19,865
And while your standard visceral reactions to game characters

700
00:39:19,865 --> 00:39:24,408
tend to be very transient, these types of influences

701
00:39:24,408 --> 00:39:27,749
tend to stick around because we're cementing them

702
00:39:27,749 --> 00:39:29,470
at that emotional level.

703
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:34,013
Now, of course, you don't need over-the-top visual effects

704
00:39:34,013 --> 00:39:35,394
to achieve those same goals.

705
00:39:35,394 --> 00:39:38,575
Sometimes even just a simple color shift

706
00:39:38,575 --> 00:39:40,356
can affect someone's retention.

707
00:39:41,218 --> 00:39:46,180
As I demonstrated earlier, Gears had a very, very dark storyline.

708
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:49,701
And it got darker with every single iteration of the game.

709
00:39:49,701 --> 00:39:53,163
The first game was about the loss of home and family.

710
00:39:53,163 --> 00:39:57,824
The second game transitioned from small battles to these huge wars.

711
00:39:57,824 --> 00:40:01,686
And instead of losing friends, we were losing entire populations and cities.

712
00:40:01,686 --> 00:40:05,667
By the third game, we're dealing with the extinction of the human race

713
00:40:05,667 --> 00:40:07,968
and the potential destruction of the entire planet.

714
00:40:08,965 --> 00:40:12,407
Every game was more depressing than the last.

715
00:40:12,407 --> 00:40:15,509
And we really feared that this oppressive tone

716
00:40:15,509 --> 00:40:19,171
might overwhelm or turn away a lot of our players.

717
00:40:19,171 --> 00:40:23,233
So to counter that, we very intentionally tried to contrast

718
00:40:23,233 --> 00:40:26,615
the visual and emotional feedback channels.

719
00:40:26,615 --> 00:40:31,258
When the story became darker, the visuals became brighter,

720
00:40:31,258 --> 00:40:33,179
more colorful, and more saturated.

721
00:40:34,244 --> 00:40:37,025
This was less emotionally oppressive to people,

722
00:40:37,025 --> 00:40:38,265
so they stuck around longer.

723
00:40:38,265 --> 00:40:40,166
And while there are obviously

724
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:43,347
a bajillion other factors involved,

725
00:40:43,347 --> 00:40:45,367
we actually saw a 10% increase in retention

726
00:40:45,367 --> 00:40:48,328
in campaign completion rates,

727
00:40:48,328 --> 00:40:52,690
and a 14% increase in co-op completion rates across titles.

728
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:58,531
And this type of tactic is actually a lot more common

729
00:40:58,531 --> 00:40:59,091
than you think.

730
00:40:59,091 --> 00:41:01,572
It's actually referred to as developing the color script

731
00:41:01,572 --> 00:41:02,912
for your story.

732
00:41:02,912 --> 00:41:05,533
We were heavily influenced by the color script

733
00:41:05,533 --> 00:41:08,454
for Pixar's Up during the development of Gears,

734
00:41:08,454 --> 00:41:11,034
which follows a similar type of progression.

735
00:41:11,034 --> 00:41:13,755
It's completely desaturated in the intro,

736
00:41:13,755 --> 00:41:14,616
cooler in the middle,

737
00:41:14,616 --> 00:41:17,877
and then warm and hyper saturated near the end.

738
00:41:20,592 --> 00:41:30,856
Schindler's List shows how color can serve as a way to really focus someone's attention,

739
00:41:30,856 --> 00:41:35,297
but more importantly, recall those memories at the height of emotional impact

740
00:41:35,297 --> 00:41:36,157
to ensure that they stick around.

741
00:41:36,157 --> 00:41:42,179
Our struggles with game tone in the Gears franchise heavily influenced the development

742
00:41:42,179 --> 00:41:48,041
of our later games. We really asked ourselves what changes we could make to the game

743
00:41:48,041 --> 00:41:49,502
without changing the actual

744
00:41:50,231 --> 00:41:56,253
Gameplay that would hold on to people, more people, for longer periods of time.

745
00:41:56,253 --> 00:42:01,595
And when we were at that point in our discussions, this was Fortnite.

746
00:42:01,595 --> 00:42:05,236
It was very gritty and very violent, just like Gears.

747
00:42:05,236 --> 00:42:10,738
This is Fortnite now. It's whimsical, it's lighthearted, they look completely different.

748
00:42:10,738 --> 00:42:15,080
But the gameplay and the core loop hasn't actually changed.

749
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:28,209
So if you were going to play Fortnite and retain for days, hours, weeks, months, even years,

750
00:42:28,209 --> 00:42:32,232
which of those two worlds would you want to spend a thousand hours in?

751
00:42:32,232 --> 00:42:35,254
At the time, this barren landscape was Paragon.

752
00:42:35,254 --> 00:42:42,580
This lush environment is Paragon now. Again, where would you want to spend a thousand hours?

753
00:42:43,668 --> 00:42:46,490
It's not to say that you can't make a compelling experience

754
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:47,530
that's dark or moody.

755
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:51,133
What I'm trying to say is that with a directed effort,

756
00:42:51,133 --> 00:42:54,855
you can use all of those various feedback channels

757
00:42:54,855 --> 00:42:55,896
to influence retention.

758
00:42:55,896 --> 00:42:59,478
And for us, the intent was to pair

759
00:42:59,478 --> 00:43:01,620
the tactile feedback of the game

760
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:05,242
with the more visceral feedback of tone and mood

761
00:43:05,242 --> 00:43:07,223
so that we could create an experience

762
00:43:07,223 --> 00:43:10,185
that you look forward to returning to

763
00:43:10,185 --> 00:43:12,087
day after day after day.

764
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:19,052
So good feedback that helps player understand their feeling

765
00:43:19,052 --> 00:43:23,476
or understand their surroundings at a physical, sensory,

766
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:26,258
and emotional level can make them feel comfortable,

767
00:43:26,258 --> 00:43:29,200
and powerful, and successful,

768
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,262
leading to the perception that your game is better,

769
00:43:32,262 --> 00:43:35,084
and therefore fostering repeat play.

770
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:41,518
All right, last category for the day is mental models.

771
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:43,820
If you understand your player's frame of reference,

772
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:46,482
you can use it to enhance your design

773
00:43:46,482 --> 00:43:48,003
rather than fight against it

774
00:43:48,003 --> 00:43:50,925
and risk player confusion or even abandonment.

775
00:43:52,352 --> 00:43:55,733
In Fortnite, there are dozens of different objects that you can collect.

776
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:58,494
Some are meant to be weapons used in combat.

777
00:43:58,494 --> 00:44:02,055
Others are meant as tools that are used for scavenging.

778
00:44:02,055 --> 00:44:04,176
And on paper, this makes perfect sense.

779
00:44:04,176 --> 00:44:07,717
Someone with a broom is unlikely to use it to try and chop down a tree.

780
00:44:07,717 --> 00:44:10,718
Someone with a samurai sword is unlikely to use it to smash rocks.

781
00:44:10,718 --> 00:44:12,039
These are all very rational concepts, right?

782
00:44:16,666 --> 00:44:20,870
But our UX testing actually proved the unreliability

783
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:22,992
of those rational design decisions.

784
00:44:22,992 --> 00:44:25,894
This is a player from one of our UX tests

785
00:44:25,894 --> 00:44:29,197
who tried for several minutes

786
00:44:29,197 --> 00:44:31,379
to smash rocks with a sledgehammer.

787
00:44:31,379 --> 00:44:33,661
But in the world of Fortnite,

788
00:44:33,661 --> 00:44:35,563
hammers are weapons, not tools.

789
00:44:35,563 --> 00:44:37,445
So they don't work for harvesting.

790
00:44:38,582 --> 00:44:44,044
In another test, players were totally confused when a stick was actually three times faster

791
00:44:44,044 --> 00:44:46,986
at chopping down a tree than an axe was.

792
00:44:46,986 --> 00:44:50,227
The axe is a dedicated weapon, not a tool.

793
00:44:50,227 --> 00:44:56,710
The design intent didn't match with the player's mental model of how these objects should function.

794
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:59,111
This caused frustration.

795
00:44:59,111 --> 00:45:04,353
It made the game feel very much like a long grind, which pushed players away.

796
00:45:05,499 --> 00:45:12,144
Eventually, we separated the weapon and harvesting systems so that each progresses and operates

797
00:45:12,144 --> 00:45:12,565
independently.

798
00:45:12,565 --> 00:45:18,469
And after that change, we saw significantly less confusion about harvesting in our UX

799
00:45:18,469 --> 00:45:18,810
tests.

800
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:24,434
And, again, while there's a million other things that went into the two builds, we actually

801
00:45:24,434 --> 00:45:29,038
saw a 10% increase in repeat play amongst new players.

802
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:35,730
Conventions like using an ax to chop wood

803
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:38,811
can be important in other ways as well.

804
00:45:38,811 --> 00:45:42,373
Diablo has a red globe of liquid health on the left

805
00:45:42,373 --> 00:45:45,335
and a blue globe of liquid mana on the right.

806
00:45:45,335 --> 00:45:48,017
So when you find a red potion in game,

807
00:45:48,017 --> 00:45:50,578
there's a pretty strong affordance for what it'll do.

808
00:45:50,578 --> 00:45:53,700
It matches player expectations, making it easy to learn.

809
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:54,160
But that's not Diablo.

810
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,622
That's actually Path of Exile.

811
00:45:56,622 --> 00:45:58,102
And here is Arbiter's Judgment.

812
00:46:01,811 --> 00:46:04,894
And here is torchlight, I could go on.

813
00:46:04,894 --> 00:46:09,718
Similar games, similar genres, similar gameplay, similar UI.

814
00:46:09,718 --> 00:46:11,720
Why reinvent the wheel?

815
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:17,065
People use known conventions as a means to learn new things.

816
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:19,107
So you can make their experience better

817
00:46:19,107 --> 00:46:20,288
by taking advantage of that.

818
00:46:20,288 --> 00:46:24,012
The less that players have to struggle to learn new things,

819
00:46:24,012 --> 00:46:26,414
the more likely they are to stick around.

820
00:46:27,556 --> 00:46:32,140
This means that affordances are actually pretty fantastic for retention.

821
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:35,523
You see a piñata, you want to hit the piñata.

822
00:46:35,523 --> 00:46:36,604
How do you hit it?

823
00:46:36,604 --> 00:46:38,386
You swing back your weapon.

824
00:46:38,386 --> 00:46:42,730
And sometimes when you hit them, the piñata switches from paper to silver,

825
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:45,733
or from silver to diamond-studded gold.

826
00:46:45,733 --> 00:46:49,657
And you get a pretty good sense that it's actually been upgraded

827
00:46:49,657 --> 00:46:52,239
and that the items inside will be more valuable.

828
00:46:53,273 --> 00:46:56,475
We never taught players this because what's intuitive

829
00:46:56,475 --> 00:46:57,615
doesn't need to be learned.

830
00:46:57,615 --> 00:46:59,856
It hits us at that visceral level

831
00:46:59,856 --> 00:47:02,137
and positively affects our behavior.

832
00:47:02,137 --> 00:47:05,298
So gameplay is more natural and with fewer hurdles,

833
00:47:05,298 --> 00:47:07,098
people are more likely to stick around,

834
00:47:07,098 --> 00:47:10,179
to think about the game more, to be reflective

835
00:47:10,179 --> 00:47:12,140
and to come back and play more.

836
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:15,121
And I know that sounds like a totally obvious,

837
00:47:15,121 --> 00:47:17,222
pointless statement to make,

838
00:47:17,222 --> 00:47:20,183
but when you're caught up in the complexities of development

839
00:47:20,654 --> 00:47:24,357
with interacting goals and personalities and deadlines.

840
00:47:24,357 --> 00:47:27,780
These sort of things really often tend to slip through.

841
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,541
Take the tower design in Paragon.

842
00:47:29,541 --> 00:47:32,243
This giant thing right here is a tower.

843
00:47:32,243 --> 00:47:33,844
It's several stories tall,

844
00:47:33,844 --> 00:47:36,947
arguably the most important thing in the game,

845
00:47:36,947 --> 00:47:38,048
pretty hard to miss.

846
00:47:38,048 --> 00:47:40,910
It's right there in the middle of the screen.

847
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:43,232
It's the focal point for all team play.

848
00:47:43,232 --> 00:47:46,054
You destroy towers to advance and win the game.

849
00:47:46,695 --> 00:47:49,617
So we put tons of resources into their design.

850
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:52,018
And yet, in our original implementation,

851
00:47:52,018 --> 00:47:54,419
we totally over-rationalized.

852
00:47:54,419 --> 00:47:57,420
When you're in a game, the actual physical tower

853
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:58,561
is completely off screen.

854
00:47:58,561 --> 00:48:03,203
And what you attack is the gem that powers it.

855
00:48:03,203 --> 00:48:05,184
The gem doesn't look dangerous or protected.

856
00:48:05,184 --> 00:48:07,965
It's completely amorphous.

857
00:48:07,965 --> 00:48:10,847
And when it does attack, the tower hits you

858
00:48:10,847 --> 00:48:13,488
from somewhere completely disconnected from your view.

859
00:48:14,168 --> 00:48:16,109
So it's difficult to make that association

860
00:48:16,109 --> 00:48:17,809
between cause and effect.

861
00:48:17,809 --> 00:48:20,550
And in our UX test, we saw people tower diving

862
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:23,291
over and over and dying over and over.

863
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:25,652
Rather than attack the gem,

864
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,993
some of them even turn to attack the actual tower

865
00:48:27,993 --> 00:48:31,014
that was shooting them, which makes perfect sense,

866
00:48:31,014 --> 00:48:34,155
but that has no gameplay effect whatsoever.

867
00:48:34,155 --> 00:48:35,715
All it does is get you killed.

868
00:48:36,734 --> 00:48:39,437
This poor participant from one of our UX tests

869
00:48:39,437 --> 00:48:41,279
played on easy mode versus AI,

870
00:48:41,279 --> 00:48:44,962
which is, in theory, nearly impossible to lose.

871
00:48:44,962 --> 00:48:48,686
And after a brutal hour and a half match,

872
00:48:48,686 --> 00:48:52,931
lost the game and came away with zero kills, 35 deaths,

873
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:55,713
almost every single one of them

874
00:48:55,713 --> 00:48:58,116
due to repeatedly running under a tower and dying.

875
00:48:59,465 --> 00:49:01,645
And we saw this type of behavior very regularly

876
00:49:01,645 --> 00:49:02,345
with new players.

877
00:49:02,345 --> 00:49:04,406
It was a critical issue in our UX reports

878
00:49:04,406 --> 00:49:06,646
because it was frustrating

879
00:49:06,646 --> 00:49:09,287
and it pushed players away from the game.

880
00:49:09,287 --> 00:49:09,867
So we changed tower designs.

881
00:49:09,867 --> 00:49:14,048
Now the gems actually look more like towers.

882
00:49:14,048 --> 00:49:17,148
They have shields over them to protect them

883
00:49:17,148 --> 00:49:20,049
and the shields fall when they're vulnerable.

884
00:49:20,049 --> 00:49:21,970
And when that tower attacks you,

885
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:25,670
the beam comes straight from the thing that you're attacking

886
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:28,091
so you can better associate cause and effect.

887
00:49:28,731 --> 00:49:32,915
and they now have rings around the outside that are red when it's dangerous to approach

888
00:49:32,915 --> 00:49:37,299
and green when it's safe. Sorry if you're colorblind, still a work in progress.

889
00:49:37,299 --> 00:49:44,145
But as of our most recent UX tests, tower deaths have actually significantly decreased

890
00:49:44,145 --> 00:49:49,129
and players seem to understand towers much better and are less frustrated overall.

891
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:56,061
This goes to show that affordances run deeper than just looking at an object in the world.

892
00:49:56,061 --> 00:49:58,062
They apply to game systems as well.

893
00:49:58,062 --> 00:50:05,103
So if you can design situations and systems so that it's easy and intuitive to do the

894
00:50:05,103 --> 00:50:11,705
right thing and hard to do the wrong thing, people will find success, feel empowered,

895
00:50:11,705 --> 00:50:13,085
and stay in your game.

896
00:50:15,536 --> 00:50:19,997
Now, of course, these are only a few of the factors that could enhance retention in games,

897
00:50:19,997 --> 00:50:25,559
and when I was putting together this talk, I couldn't decide whether I wanted to talk

898
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:31,000
about the way that emotion affects design, or the way that design affects emotion.

899
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:37,482
And in the end, I really couldn't easily separate the two, and that's one of the reasons that

900
00:50:37,482 --> 00:50:39,523
I think emotional design is so important.

901
00:50:40,238 --> 00:50:41,819
It's universal.

902
00:50:41,819 --> 00:50:45,441
So if you can address the visceral, behavioral,

903
00:50:45,441 --> 00:50:47,923
and reflective components all in one design,

904
00:50:47,923 --> 00:50:50,264
you're more likely to hit on something

905
00:50:50,264 --> 00:50:54,046
that is applicable to a broad audience of humans

906
00:50:54,046 --> 00:50:59,230
rather than satisfy one small group or niche audience.

907
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:01,071
That's all I have for today.

908
00:51:01,071 --> 00:51:05,073
Thank you very much for your time.

909
00:51:05,073 --> 00:51:05,393
Thank you.

910
00:51:11,946 --> 00:51:14,487
I think we still have about five minutes or so. Yes.

911
00:51:14,487 --> 00:51:17,929
For questions and please do fill out surveys.

912
00:51:17,929 --> 00:51:21,551
We'd love to hear what you thought. Tell me how I screwed it up or how I was

913
00:51:21,551 --> 00:51:22,852
wrong. Yeah, go ahead.

914
00:51:23,381 --> 00:51:27,203
Hi Jim, this is Ryan Miller from Deep Silver Volition.

915
00:51:27,203 --> 00:51:29,484
When you were discussing the social aspect,

916
00:51:29,484 --> 00:51:32,205
you were referring primarily to the multiplayer aspect.

917
00:51:32,205 --> 00:51:34,986
I do remember that Gears of War, you had squads with you.

918
00:51:34,986 --> 00:51:37,327
And I know that players respond relatively well

919
00:51:37,327 --> 00:51:41,209
to the mentor effect of seeing an AI ally do something.

920
00:51:41,209 --> 00:51:43,750
Did that have any effect, do you think, on retention?

921
00:51:44,329 --> 00:51:53,474
Yeah absolutely, as I mentioned it's not just guilds or clans or whatever, just being on a team has that same kind of impact.

922
00:51:53,474 --> 00:51:59,137
And in Gears we actually specifically designed Dom to be more like your conscious.

923
00:51:59,137 --> 00:52:05,060
So he would say the obvious things that we wanted players to notice but they didn't necessarily.

924
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:08,281
And that helped players understand kind of puzzles and situations.

925
00:52:08,802 --> 00:52:14,889
And then each of the characters in your squad had kind of a specific personality that would offset different things

926
00:52:14,889 --> 00:52:19,674
that would really basically existed to help you understand the game or

927
00:52:19,674 --> 00:52:25,761
get more into the story or more attached to them as people. Each of them had a very specific role that we were hoping they

928
00:52:25,761 --> 00:52:26,803
would fill out.

929
00:52:26,803 --> 00:52:28,104
Okay, thank you for that information.

930
00:52:30,574 --> 00:52:35,737
Hi, I'm Hannah Murphy. I'm a new user researcher. I do freelance game user research.

931
00:52:35,737 --> 00:52:35,897
Uh-huh.

932
00:52:35,897 --> 00:52:42,161
Um, as you're talking about character design and becoming more realistic, um,

933
00:52:42,161 --> 00:52:47,204
what are your thoughts on Uncanny Valley and do you see that being an issue?

934
00:52:47,204 --> 00:52:53,488
It's, it is. It's a huge issue, right? And it's something you have to be very, very careful with.

935
00:52:53,488 --> 00:52:55,349
Uh, generally speaking, it's a lot easier.

936
00:52:56,057 --> 00:53:03,661
cheaper, faster, all of those good things to embrace kind of the cartoony side of things because

937
00:53:03,661 --> 00:53:07,182
if you don't make it all the way across the uncanny valley you're going to fall into it

938
00:53:07,182 --> 00:53:13,505
and so you have to be very very careful with that kind of stuff. As time has gone on we have

939
00:53:13,505 --> 00:53:18,827
actually realized the high production cost of these kind of characters and just recently have

940
00:53:18,827 --> 00:53:20,848
kind of started to pull back from that a little bit more.

941
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:25,773
So you'll probably start seeing the effects of that later as we get into game,

942
00:53:25,773 --> 00:53:28,335
but I was just talking to one of our animators this week who is,

943
00:53:28,335 --> 00:53:31,798
their entire design philosophy has shifted because of that.

944
00:53:31,798 --> 00:53:33,860
Just knowing how much effort is involved,

945
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:38,024
and there's no guarantee that you're always going to make it across that uncanny valley,

946
00:53:38,024 --> 00:53:39,545
so it can be very dangerous to even try.

947
00:53:39,545 --> 00:53:39,926
Thanks.

948
00:53:43,927 --> 00:53:45,267
Hi Jim, Gina Smith from 2K.

949
00:53:45,267 --> 00:53:49,968
So I really appreciate that you used a lot of different games

950
00:53:49,968 --> 00:53:52,148
as examples throughout this from different platforms

951
00:53:52,148 --> 00:53:53,909
and different genres.

952
00:53:53,909 --> 00:53:56,209
And I guess my question is, have you found that

953
00:53:56,209 --> 00:53:59,290
the platform on which a game stands

954
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:00,710
or even the genre that it comes from

955
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:02,350
affects these design principles at all?

956
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:06,631
It definitely can, but I would say it's more about

957
00:54:06,631 --> 00:54:08,771
how well you reach your target audience.

958
00:54:08,771 --> 00:54:10,792
You know, it doesn't matter if you're making

959
00:54:10,792 --> 00:54:12,672
a platformer versus a shooter.

960
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:16,662
What matters is if you're making a platform for shooter people, right?

961
00:54:16,662 --> 00:54:19,344
That's going to affect it more than just, I think, the general platform.

962
00:54:19,344 --> 00:54:20,786
Absolutely.

963
00:54:20,786 --> 00:54:23,168
And access to whatever platform that is.

964
00:54:23,168 --> 00:54:26,351
Mobile maybe, higher, because there's more of them.

965
00:54:26,351 --> 00:54:26,751
Thank you.

966
00:54:29,827 --> 00:54:31,287
Hi Jim, thanks for your talk.

967
00:54:31,287 --> 00:54:34,089
Nikki Crenshaw, I'm a PhD candidate at UC Irvine.

968
00:54:34,089 --> 00:54:35,870
So you were talking about kind of like,

969
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:37,991
if it looks like Diablo, we expect it to play like Diablo,

970
00:54:37,991 --> 00:54:40,552
that kind of like establishing player patterns and stuff

971
00:54:40,552 --> 00:54:41,493
from the way a game looks.

972
00:54:41,493 --> 00:54:44,494
And this is something I've been thinking about for a while

973
00:54:44,494 --> 00:54:46,816
where like, does this limit kind of what devs are able to do

974
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:48,497
in terms of creativity?

975
00:54:48,497 --> 00:54:50,017
James Berg, I don't know if he's in here still,

976
00:54:50,017 --> 00:54:51,478
but he gave a talk a few years ago

977
00:54:51,478 --> 00:54:52,759
about they were doing some testing

978
00:54:52,759 --> 00:54:54,180
and it was a character that had a spear,

979
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:56,581
but shot fireballs and all of these players were dying.

980
00:54:56,641 --> 00:55:00,163
they weren't expecting it to have magic abilities if it was holding a spear.

981
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:05,487
So is there a way for us to get out of kind of like, like breaking player expectations

982
00:55:05,487 --> 00:55:09,710
in a way that helps them learn or helps them break out of patterns that we've already like

983
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:10,070
really deep.

984
00:55:10,454 --> 00:55:15,236
established. I think so it's not about I think limiting our creativity in terms

985
00:55:15,236 --> 00:55:19,198
of like oh if I'm making a Diablo like game it should look like Diablo it's

986
00:55:19,198 --> 00:55:23,980
more about finding those particular aspects of your game that you don't need

987
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:28,562
to reinvent the wheel on so that you can focus on those new elements that

988
00:55:28,562 --> 00:55:32,404
actually enhance learning and creativity and you don't spend your dev cycles

989
00:55:32,404 --> 00:55:35,845
working on the things that you don't need to worry about so you can make them

990
00:55:36,425 --> 00:55:39,647
easier by making them intuitive or by using their own conventions,

991
00:55:39,647 --> 00:55:41,167
matching mental models, all those things.

992
00:55:41,167 --> 00:55:43,768
So that the player gets those things intuitively,

993
00:55:43,768 --> 00:55:47,930
and then your dev effort can go into the more creative and new elements

994
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:51,231
that are unique to your game, whatever that is,

995
00:55:51,231 --> 00:55:54,913
and really, you know, shining the spotlight on those,

996
00:55:54,913 --> 00:55:56,554
because that's what's going to make your game stand out.

997
00:55:56,554 --> 00:55:56,814
Cool. Thank you.

998
00:56:00,337 --> 00:56:02,280
Hey Jim, Mustafa Talgi from Xbox.

999
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:07,067
So my question is, what are the various ways and methods

1000
00:56:07,067 --> 00:56:10,232
you use to effectively and accurately

1001
00:56:11,545 --> 00:56:16,546
measure, engage, emotional involvement of user. So one

1002
00:56:16,546 --> 00:56:19,667
quick example you gave is in Paragon when the character

1003
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:22,507
became popular. So you're looking at probably in-game

1004
00:56:22,507 --> 00:56:27,748
data, how it rose of that character's playability and the

1005
00:56:27,748 --> 00:56:31,389
count. But for some trickier ones like the bacon out of the

1006
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:35,890
toilet, how do you kind of get that data and effectively and

1007
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:40,111
accurately measure like, oh, the user's engagement rose? Is it

1008
00:56:40,111 --> 00:56:41,111
just looking at...

1009
00:56:41,592 --> 00:56:45,915
Twitter data, forum data, collating and correlating it.

1010
00:56:45,915 --> 00:56:47,736
Are there any other effective ways you have?

1011
00:56:47,736 --> 00:56:51,059
There's... getting that data is incredibly difficult.

1012
00:56:51,059 --> 00:56:54,642
It's one of those things that you have to...

1013
00:56:54,642 --> 00:56:57,023
Okay, so back in the days of Gears of War,

1014
00:56:57,023 --> 00:56:58,925
we collected data on everything.

1015
00:56:58,925 --> 00:57:02,588
And we actually ended up with so much data coming back.

1016
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:06,113
we were doing a denial of service attacks on ourselves

1017
00:57:06,113 --> 00:57:08,055
because we had more coming back than was going out.

1018
00:57:08,055 --> 00:57:09,837
So we had this huge amount of data

1019
00:57:09,837 --> 00:57:12,360
that we had for no purpose and nothing to do with it,

1020
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,443
and so we ended up throwing a lot of it away.

1021
00:57:14,443 --> 00:57:17,927
So now we try and be a lot more targeted

1022
00:57:17,927 --> 00:57:21,030
in where you collect data on a specific thing

1023
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:23,093
that we are trying to research

1024
00:57:23,093 --> 00:57:24,234
and find more information of.

1025
00:57:24,704 --> 00:57:27,166
But if you don't think about that in advance,

1026
00:57:27,166 --> 00:57:29,347
that means you won't have the data available.

1027
00:57:29,347 --> 00:57:31,808
So a lot of it has to do with collaboration

1028
00:57:31,808 --> 00:57:33,649
between our teams and the dev teams,

1029
00:57:33,649 --> 00:57:37,752
where we say, we're looking at this specific thing for x.

1030
00:57:37,752 --> 00:57:41,974
Will you put the analytics hooks in the game

1031
00:57:41,974 --> 00:57:43,375
so that we can collect that data?

1032
00:57:43,375 --> 00:57:45,797
And then over the course of several builds,

1033
00:57:45,797 --> 00:57:47,938
we'll send out surveys or do UX tests

1034
00:57:47,938 --> 00:57:50,800
and see how that information changes.

1035
00:57:52,242 --> 00:57:56,886
that's not always easy to do because you need the dev team out to be able to do

1036
00:57:56,886 --> 00:57:58,168
that for you to put the hooks in.

1037
00:57:58,168 --> 00:58:01,250
You need a data analyst to go through the data and all, you know,

1038
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:02,351
all those various aspects.

1039
00:58:02,351 --> 00:58:06,255
This is for predetermined, uh, emotional engagement.

1040
00:58:06,255 --> 00:58:10,379
Like you know that you want to measure this event because you know it may

1041
00:58:10,379 --> 00:58:13,441
create that emotional engagement.

1042
00:58:13,622 --> 00:58:16,463
there's other a lot of others where it's aha

1043
00:58:16,463 --> 00:58:20,684
I just discovered this emotional these are probably the trickier ones of how do you

1044
00:58:20,684 --> 00:58:24,465
yeah in a lot of those cases you won't have the data you just kind of have to

1045
00:58:24,465 --> 00:58:28,967
to look at it and you might be able to find some sort of data that supports

1046
00:58:28,967 --> 00:58:32,028
that that's dangerous because it may not always be accurate

1047
00:58:32,028 --> 00:58:37,130
uh so I wouldn't I wouldn't recommend that but it's possible

1048
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:37,950
um and some of it is just

1049
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:41,654
as a designer you kind of have to think about these things in advance

1050
00:58:41,654 --> 00:58:45,097
so you don't get into that state where you need to make the change and if you

1051
00:58:45,097 --> 00:58:49,341
can think about it beforehand chances are better that at the end

1052
00:58:49,341 --> 00:58:50,342
you'll come out ahead. Thank you.

1053
00:58:50,342 --> 00:58:54,926
Hi, Joyce Wong from WB Games. So you're talking about patterns

1054
00:58:54,926 --> 00:58:58,529
and creating rituals for players by making them repeat the things over and

1055
00:58:58,529 --> 00:59:01,572
over again. So how do you combat repetitiveness that can come out of that?

1056
00:59:02,117 --> 00:59:07,480
So that's where I was saying at that one point where just doing a pattern can start to feel like a grind

1057
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,561
It doesn't it in and of itself doesn't become

1058
00:59:10,561 --> 00:59:13,322
Important or significant unless that pattern is meaningful

1059
00:59:13,322 --> 00:59:19,685
So like those those reward messages that I had the example I use where you go left right right good job

1060
00:59:20,146 --> 00:59:23,028
those are actual rewards therefore they become meaningful to the player

1061
00:59:23,028 --> 00:59:27,310
and so they're more than just a somatic pattern of pressing buttons

1062
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:31,113
and you have to you do have to be careful about things becoming a grind

1063
00:59:31,113 --> 00:59:36,096
or things becoming repetitive. One way to address that I would say is

1064
00:59:36,096 --> 00:59:39,858
start by establishing your pattern and then once it's established start

1065
00:59:39,858 --> 00:59:42,680
building it and layering in more and more difficult

1066
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:46,783
things or new things to kind of keep that experience fresh

1067
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:46,963
and

1068
00:59:47,247 --> 00:59:57,090
allow players to feel mastery of the thing that they're doing repeatedly while also being

1069
00:59:57,090 --> 01:00:01,172
challenged by the new thing so that you kind of have helped them experience growth in the long term.

1070
01:00:01,172 --> 01:00:03,813
So my question's kind of a follow-up in the other direction.

1071
01:00:03,813 --> 01:00:09,414
What advice do you have in terms of making sure your patterns aren't so good that it leads to

1072
01:00:09,414 --> 01:00:15,496
addictive behavior? That, you know, dark patterns and all that is a very...

1073
01:00:16,806 --> 01:00:18,227
It's a slippery slope.

1074
01:00:18,227 --> 01:00:20,048
I specifically tried to avoid it today.

1075
01:00:20,048 --> 01:00:22,589
I didn't want to talk about ways to get players

1076
01:00:22,589 --> 01:00:26,072
to spend more money or ways to manipulate them.

1077
01:00:26,072 --> 01:00:29,574
I think you have to go in with clear goals

1078
01:00:29,574 --> 01:00:32,896
and a clear conscience to actually know

1079
01:00:32,896 --> 01:00:36,238
that you're doing the right thing for the right reasons.

1080
01:00:36,238 --> 01:00:39,019
You know, you'll know if you're not, right?

1081
01:00:39,019 --> 01:00:40,240
But you do have to be careful

1082
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:44,743
because there still can be times where you want...

1083
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,881
a pattern for the right reason.

1084
01:00:46,881 --> 01:00:49,643
But like you said, people become addicted.

1085
01:00:49,643 --> 01:00:51,964
People play hours and hours of MMOs,

1086
01:00:51,964 --> 01:00:53,786
you get addicted to them and can't break the loop,

1087
01:00:53,786 --> 01:00:54,486
all that stuff.

1088
01:00:54,486 --> 01:00:59,630
I don't know, that's a very sticky ethical area

1089
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:02,612
that I'm not sure I wanna get into right now.

1090
01:01:02,612 --> 01:01:03,092
Sure, thank you.

1091
01:01:05,056 --> 01:01:07,197
Hi, Dana Ludwig from Xbox.

1092
01:01:07,197 --> 01:01:11,739
You have mentioned a couple of times about UX testing.

1093
01:01:11,739 --> 01:01:14,781
How is that different from user research testing?

1094
01:01:14,781 --> 01:01:18,743
Can you just kind of describe what the goals are?

1095
01:01:18,743 --> 01:01:20,744
I don't know that I could address that one.

1096
01:01:20,744 --> 01:01:22,925
I would guess, I have my UX people down here.

1097
01:01:22,925 --> 01:01:25,166
I'm gonna guess they're just different terms

1098
01:01:25,166 --> 01:01:26,867
for the same sort of thing, really.

1099
01:01:26,867 --> 01:01:28,488
I mean, I say our UX test,

1100
01:01:28,488 --> 01:01:31,089
but we have our researchers come in, set up the test,

1101
01:01:31,089 --> 01:01:32,410
we do the observation, all that stuff.

1102
01:01:32,410 --> 01:01:34,251
So it's pretty much the same thing.

1103
01:01:35,127 --> 01:01:39,103
Yeah. Cool. Thank you everyone for your time. Appreciate it.
