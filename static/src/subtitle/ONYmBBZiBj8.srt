1
00:00:05,985 --> 00:00:06,546
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:08,187 --> 00:00:08,867
Good afternoon.

3
00:00:09,328 --> 00:00:12,230
I'm going to talk to you about my specific process of how

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,792
I go about immersing a creative world into a game user

5
00:00:15,812 --> 00:00:16,232
interface.

6
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:17,693
My name is Steph Chow.

7
00:00:18,073 --> 00:00:19,935
I am a UX UI consultant for games,

8
00:00:20,155 --> 00:00:21,676
and I'm really excited to be here.

9
00:00:22,216 --> 00:00:25,478
My first GDC was back in 2014, and it

10
00:00:25,498 --> 00:00:27,860
was such a great experience to attend these sessions.

11
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:31,362
And the fact that I'm standing here giving my own talk

12
00:00:31,422 --> 00:00:32,643
is truly unbelievable.

13
00:00:33,404 --> 00:00:35,465
So I really hope you folks get something good out of it today.

14
00:00:37,146 --> 00:00:38,447
To give a short background on myself,

15
00:00:39,007 --> 00:00:41,108
before entering the game industry,

16
00:00:41,468 --> 00:00:43,169
I worked in the field of graphic design,

17
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,911
primarily with branding consumer products for entertainment.

18
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:51,334
I then joined the game industry back in 2012 with Disney Games

19
00:00:51,854 --> 00:00:54,255
to help out with art direction and UI UX.

20
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:56,296
And even after my time at Disney,

21
00:00:56,496 --> 00:00:58,097
I was able to work on other big brands

22
00:00:58,137 --> 00:01:00,659
with my consulting work for both new and live games.

23
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,600
And so I've had the opportunity to work

24
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,862
with really terrific brands that revolve around unique worlds.

25
00:01:08,662 --> 00:01:10,143
And for today, I have a couple goals

26
00:01:10,183 --> 00:01:11,425
I hope I can achieve with you.

27
00:01:12,225 --> 00:01:13,366
I hope that at the end of this talk,

28
00:01:13,426 --> 00:01:15,588
you will have a knowledge of the impact

29
00:01:15,688 --> 00:01:17,690
UI can have on your game's overall branding.

30
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,412
You will have learned a method of how to go about

31
00:01:20,432 --> 00:01:22,033
producing creative UI elements

32
00:01:22,194 --> 00:01:23,655
that complements your game's world.

33
00:01:24,315 --> 00:01:26,917
And last but not least, an understanding of the balancing

34
00:01:27,038 --> 00:01:30,200
act required between your narrative UI and usability.

35
00:01:32,448 --> 00:01:34,830
So with my history embedded in working with art direction

36
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,651
and UI and UX for games, I learned a lot of what it means

37
00:01:37,711 --> 00:01:39,752
to work on games backed by great IP.

38
00:01:40,772 --> 00:01:43,153
And as I worked on these games, I grew to realize

39
00:01:43,193 --> 00:01:45,934
that one of the reasons why players play these games

40
00:01:46,174 --> 00:01:48,075
is not just because the game is fun itself,

41
00:01:48,816 --> 00:01:51,337
but it's because of the world these IPs stem from,

42
00:01:51,677 --> 00:01:53,418
that fans grow to love for years

43
00:01:53,658 --> 00:01:55,058
and sometimes even their entire life.

44
00:01:57,397 --> 00:02:00,260
And when I say worlds, I mean the fictitious universe

45
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,583
created from mediums like film, games,

46
00:02:02,963 --> 00:02:04,785
and have their own individual culture,

47
00:02:04,985 --> 00:02:06,346
visual rules, and aesthetics.

48
00:02:07,407 --> 00:02:09,530
These worlds are the things people fall in love with

49
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,311
because of the unique perspective they present

50
00:02:11,592 --> 00:02:12,813
that isn't of our world.

51
00:02:13,594 --> 00:02:14,835
And when it comes to games,

52
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:16,397
and when it comes to games,

53
00:02:16,557 --> 00:02:18,339
the entire screen is an opportunity

54
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:19,840
to help immerse a player in that world.

55
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,912
So within a world, there are so many different visuals

56
00:02:25,092 --> 00:02:27,815
that one can take reference from when developing their game

57
00:02:27,835 --> 00:02:28,775
and their user interface.

58
00:02:29,796 --> 00:02:31,978
It's with the details that go beyond character art

59
00:02:32,138 --> 00:02:34,841
and environments like typography, iconography,

60
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:37,483
color palettes that help keep a player immersed

61
00:02:37,743 --> 00:02:38,684
and engaged in a game.

62
00:02:39,565 --> 00:02:41,146
And in my years of working on interface,

63
00:02:41,767 --> 00:02:44,629
really what I've aimed for with Art Direction for UIUX

64
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,291
is a branded experience.

65
00:02:48,197 --> 00:02:52,779
Creative worlds presented in games can make for a game's holistic brand vision and journey.

66
00:02:53,899 --> 00:02:56,580
And that's what you can achieve within a game's world and experience.

67
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,881
A truly creative and exciting experience that through visuals, but also through functionality.

68
00:03:02,661 --> 00:03:08,963
While we often talk about user experience through via functionality, this player experience along with world immersion

69
00:03:09,463 --> 00:03:11,424
becomes defining of a great brand experience.

70
00:03:13,003 --> 00:03:16,566
Take for example Bioshock Infinite Game by Irrational Games.

71
00:03:17,066 --> 00:03:18,827
Yes, the game is a first-person shooter

72
00:03:19,087 --> 00:03:20,408
set in the early 1900s,

73
00:03:20,948 --> 00:03:22,609
but while you're not shooting up enemies

74
00:03:22,749 --> 00:03:24,750
or engaging in psychokinetic powers,

75
00:03:25,311 --> 00:03:27,492
you're still able to be immersed within the world

76
00:03:27,732 --> 00:03:30,474
while navigating crucial UI that enables the game

77
00:03:31,414 --> 00:03:33,375
to be played by the player in the first place.

78
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,797
And that brings me to an important point.

79
00:03:38,297 --> 00:03:41,420
Just as important for a game to be visually immersive,

80
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:44,783
games as interactive experiences need to be usable

81
00:03:44,883 --> 00:03:45,724
and easy to use.

82
00:03:46,404 --> 00:03:48,566
We want as little friction to happen

83
00:03:48,606 --> 00:03:50,388
so the player can enjoy the game's world

84
00:03:50,448 --> 00:03:52,209
because it plays into the bigger picture

85
00:03:52,369 --> 00:03:54,051
of defining a great brand experience.

86
00:03:54,812 --> 00:03:57,634
A pretty game is nothing with a bad user experience.

87
00:03:57,994 --> 00:04:00,416
So it's imperative that you focus on creating a UI

88
00:04:00,797 --> 00:04:03,379
that is simultaneously usable and immersive.

89
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,535
Even with the Dead Space series by EA,

90
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:10,516
the team successfully created a diegetic user interface

91
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:12,376
that had yourself and the main character

92
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,257
immersed in the same world and seeing the same UI.

93
00:04:16,017 --> 00:04:18,538
There is still, though, a simultaneous focus, however,

94
00:04:18,698 --> 00:04:20,758
on how everything is laid out and designed

95
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:23,299
that enables the player to frictionlessly

96
00:04:23,499 --> 00:04:24,720
navigate the game's content.

97
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,740
So when we talk about immersive elements with your game,

98
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,921
which equals out to the entire user experience,

99
00:04:31,461 --> 00:04:34,422
UI has the same capability to immerse a player

100
00:04:34,462 --> 00:04:36,043
into a world just like characters,

101
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:38,124
visual effects, and environments.

102
00:04:39,164 --> 00:04:41,685
UI is an opportunity to reflect your game's world

103
00:04:41,805 --> 00:04:43,586
and strengthen your game's visual branding

104
00:04:43,646 --> 00:04:46,927
through narrative, graphics, and of course, usability.

105
00:04:48,985 --> 00:04:52,288
So in a compact amount of time, I will discuss how to embed

106
00:04:52,328 --> 00:04:55,570
a game's world in its UI via these three phases,

107
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,612
research, exploration, and iteration.

108
00:05:00,313 --> 00:05:02,875
So step one, let's create the foundation,

109
00:05:02,995 --> 00:05:04,816
power up and research your world.

110
00:05:05,457 --> 00:05:07,458
What is the world you are presenting to the player?

111
00:05:07,638 --> 00:05:09,860
What is the world influenced by culturally?

112
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,542
What visuals, patterns, textures can you take on

113
00:05:12,582 --> 00:05:13,422
with your UI?

114
00:05:14,516 --> 00:05:16,618
This is a time to seek out the visual elements

115
00:05:16,658 --> 00:05:17,799
that make your world distinct.

116
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,742
And it's quite possible that the same references

117
00:05:20,842 --> 00:05:22,443
your game's world is inspired by

118
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:25,626
can be the same references that your UI can be inspired by.

119
00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:27,568
But there's so many different places

120
00:05:27,848 --> 00:05:30,070
your UI can get inspiration from.

121
00:05:31,472 --> 00:05:32,933
UI can be inspired by history,

122
00:05:33,473 --> 00:05:35,994
most notably how the Bethesda's Fallout series

123
00:05:36,134 --> 00:05:39,816
took inspiration from American 1950s post-war signage

124
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,117
and technology interfaces.

125
00:05:41,817 --> 00:05:44,258
The Fallout series has a remarkably branded image

126
00:05:44,638 --> 00:05:45,399
through its UI.

127
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:48,300
Typography, color, textures, all of it plays a part

128
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,202
of keeping your universe immersed into the game.

129
00:05:53,383 --> 00:05:55,163
The UI evokes a powerful brand,

130
00:05:55,804 --> 00:05:57,565
while the player enacts with contact

131
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,326
in a way that allows them a fun experience.

132
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,402
UI can even be inspired by nature,

133
00:06:04,843 --> 00:06:06,345
as seen here in King's Paradise Bay.

134
00:06:07,105 --> 00:06:09,889
You can see how the button's color palette and treatment

135
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,151
is reminiscent of oceans and natural rocks.

136
00:06:13,453 --> 00:06:16,256
UI can even be inspired by, say, a subculture,

137
00:06:16,936 --> 00:06:19,539
where it's very clear how games like Nintendo's Splatoon 2

138
00:06:19,619 --> 00:06:21,922
gets its inspiration from punk and urban references.

139
00:06:22,863 --> 00:06:25,144
While this universe is out of this world,

140
00:06:25,444 --> 00:06:27,625
their UI draws actually from very familiar,

141
00:06:27,685 --> 00:06:30,187
fun color palettes that you will see often in graffiti

142
00:06:30,327 --> 00:06:32,168
and other fashionable punk patterns.

143
00:06:33,108 --> 00:06:36,150
So big picture, UI doesn't have to just be

144
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,091
a bright, juicy green button.

145
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:40,052
There are plenty of ways to dress it up.

146
00:06:40,132 --> 00:06:42,873
So in a natural way that fits with your game's narrative

147
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:43,573
if you desire it.

148
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,181
Now all those games that I showed were already live,

149
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:51,602
and for example of myself with this process,

150
00:06:52,122 --> 00:06:54,143
when I was working on Moana's Island Life,

151
00:06:54,883 --> 00:06:56,884
I had spent hours researching myself

152
00:06:56,964 --> 00:06:58,305
in the Oceania culture,

153
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,886
which is what the movie itself is based off of.

154
00:07:01,606 --> 00:07:02,986
And when you are researching,

155
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:06,408
you start to not only find keywords that define your world,

156
00:07:06,788 --> 00:07:09,009
but you start seeing inspiration for your UI.

157
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:12,212
You start to see how icons can be designed,

158
00:07:12,252 --> 00:07:13,452
how silhouettes can be used,

159
00:07:13,952 --> 00:07:16,233
or what even kind of color palettes or typography

160
00:07:16,273 --> 00:07:18,653
you can dot to these three key words.

161
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:22,514
And that is going to allow you to start researching

162
00:07:22,594 --> 00:07:24,875
handful of fonts that can complement your world,

163
00:07:25,715 --> 00:07:27,476
start developing a UI color palette

164
00:07:27,496 --> 00:07:28,936
that guides the user naturally

165
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:31,137
while still maintaining a branded experience,

166
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:33,377
or even provide inspiration

167
00:07:33,517 --> 00:07:35,638
of what kind of pop-up container shapes

168
00:07:36,058 --> 00:07:37,958
you can house your UI content in.

169
00:07:39,985 --> 00:07:41,905
So after researching your world,

170
00:07:42,245 --> 00:07:43,866
picking up visual cues and palettes,

171
00:07:44,066 --> 00:07:46,807
you can then take this all into exploration

172
00:07:46,847 --> 00:07:48,167
for a couple of sample screens.

173
00:07:48,907 --> 00:07:51,108
And by doing so, you can see what portions

174
00:07:51,128 --> 00:07:52,608
of your research is going to work

175
00:07:52,768 --> 00:07:54,209
and maybe not work so well.

176
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:57,790
My suggestion would be to apply this exploration

177
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,011
with something like perhaps a main game HUD,

178
00:08:00,171 --> 00:08:01,171
a character screen.

179
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:06,157
So to recap, within research that acts as your foundation

180
00:08:06,197 --> 00:08:08,418
for your UI immersion, I would recommend

181
00:08:08,618 --> 00:08:10,980
looking into reference visuals and their details

182
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,381
that inspire your game's world.

183
00:08:12,981 --> 00:08:14,842
If you can do that beyond Google by, say,

184
00:08:14,963 --> 00:08:18,745
watching movies, museum visits that

185
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,627
are similar to the world that has inspired your game,

186
00:08:22,027 --> 00:08:23,388
that makes for even better reference.

187
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:26,291
And finally, once you have all this research,

188
00:08:26,351 --> 00:08:29,655
you can then start taking it to the exploration phase.

189
00:08:30,336 --> 00:08:32,419
So then when we go into the exploration phase,

190
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:35,103
this is our chance to build out our UI

191
00:08:35,203 --> 00:08:36,745
on perhaps a couple of key screens.

192
00:08:36,865 --> 00:08:38,748
And we want to answer the question of

193
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:41,131
how do you immerse the world into your UI?

194
00:08:43,645 --> 00:08:46,809
And it's exciting, because all you have to do is just explore.

195
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:48,531
I think this is a great opportunity

196
00:08:49,553 --> 00:08:52,476
to be able to explore all different kind of spectrums

197
00:08:52,537 --> 00:08:55,781
of visuals when you're setting out for your UI direction.

198
00:08:56,422 --> 00:08:59,886
To me, it's almost like, let's say, baking a cake.

199
00:09:01,145 --> 00:09:03,187
There's so many different ingredients to play with

200
00:09:03,528 --> 00:09:06,491
that not only influences the way that your cake tastes,

201
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:07,752
but also how it looks.

202
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:10,274
There's an endless amount of variations

203
00:09:10,334 --> 00:09:11,255
that you can proceed with,

204
00:09:11,456 --> 00:09:13,998
but this is a time with the range of UI elements

205
00:09:14,038 --> 00:09:15,720
for your game that you can think about

206
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,221
how your player will enjoy the most.

207
00:09:17,842 --> 00:09:20,104
But what's important is that you explore the spectrum

208
00:09:20,284 --> 00:09:21,726
offered by your ingredients.

209
00:09:22,802 --> 00:09:25,605
These UI ingredients can allow for immersion,

210
00:09:26,045 --> 00:09:29,208
but within each one, there are different spectrums

211
00:09:29,428 --> 00:09:31,590
you can experiment with during your exploration.

212
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,993
For example, diegetic UI or non-diegetic UI.

213
00:09:35,673 --> 00:09:37,155
Which one will work better for your game?

214
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:41,236
And as a quick recap, diegetic UI is interface

215
00:09:41,256 --> 00:09:42,978
that is included in the game's world.

216
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:46,203
For example, it can be seen and heard by the game characters.

217
00:09:46,843 --> 00:09:48,486
Non-diegetic, however, is interface

218
00:09:48,706 --> 00:09:50,669
that is rendered outside the game world,

219
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,713
only visible and audible to the players in the real world.

220
00:09:55,478 --> 00:09:57,740
So with diegetic, you're able to gain

221
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,281
a fully immersive narrative visually.

222
00:10:00,841 --> 00:10:03,502
It's great when the narrative is very natural,

223
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:05,223
like let's say looking at a map

224
00:10:05,303 --> 00:10:07,824
the same way that Campo Santos Firewatch does,

225
00:10:08,284 --> 00:10:10,686
or even in Dead Space, because you and your character

226
00:10:10,806 --> 00:10:12,947
are in a spaceship, ultimately,

227
00:10:13,307 --> 00:10:15,128
you're looking at the same heads-up display.

228
00:10:16,328 --> 00:10:19,230
But there's also risk to diegetic UI.

229
00:10:20,778 --> 00:10:22,500
If you have a lot of information to show,

230
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,382
there is a chance that crucial information

231
00:10:24,422 --> 00:10:27,925
can get buried due to the narrative UI.

232
00:10:28,145 --> 00:10:31,649
Complex tasks in the game may have a lot of friction

233
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:34,111
due to a heavy cognitive load required by these tasks.

234
00:10:34,792 --> 00:10:36,493
And when you commit to a diegetic look,

235
00:10:36,713 --> 00:10:38,655
you're committing to preserving the fourth wall,

236
00:10:39,016 --> 00:10:40,617
which could prove later difficult,

237
00:10:40,817 --> 00:10:42,539
depending on your player's task in the game.

238
00:10:45,017 --> 00:10:47,879
And non-diegetic shouldn't be considered a loss of narrative,

239
00:10:48,239 --> 00:10:52,322
as it's there to help guide the player through complex tasks

240
00:10:52,422 --> 00:10:53,143
and strategies.

241
00:10:53,963 --> 00:10:56,525
And as you see with even games such as Riot's League

242
00:10:56,545 --> 00:10:58,646
of Legends or Atlas' Persona series,

243
00:10:59,107 --> 00:11:02,009
the two keep to non-diegetic because they

244
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:04,110
have complex tasks and content that

245
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:07,452
should be clearly separated so the player can easily

246
00:11:07,472 --> 00:11:07,913
play the game.

247
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:11,584
But of course, the risk of non-diegetic

248
00:11:11,925 --> 00:11:14,967
is depending on how it is laid out and designed.

249
00:11:15,527 --> 00:11:17,769
Because the way, if it's badly laid out,

250
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:21,731
you can risk further complicating your complex task.

251
00:11:22,212 --> 00:11:23,913
And if it's not designed correctly,

252
00:11:23,993 --> 00:11:26,895
then it will distract from the world being presented,

253
00:11:27,335 --> 00:11:29,236
in addition to just breaking the fourth wall.

254
00:11:30,337 --> 00:11:32,879
So, how do you explore the decision

255
00:11:32,979 --> 00:11:35,801
to have a UI that is more diegetic or non-diegetic?

256
00:11:36,742 --> 00:11:37,442
Well, it depends.

257
00:11:38,693 --> 00:11:39,754
Both can be narrative.

258
00:11:40,174 --> 00:11:42,156
This should be more of a decision based

259
00:11:42,196 --> 00:11:43,977
on your game's mediums and mechanics.

260
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:46,038
For simple mechanics or console games,

261
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:48,940
you may not need a non-diegetic UI

262
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,482
and can project through characters

263
00:11:51,702 --> 00:11:52,883
or other diegetic methods.

264
00:11:53,483 --> 00:11:55,724
But perhaps your game is significantly complex

265
00:11:56,285 --> 00:11:58,806
with strategy that creating that UI layer

266
00:11:58,986 --> 00:12:01,028
in between the player will make

267
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,589
for a frictionless experience

268
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:04,890
between a player and a game's world.

269
00:12:06,945 --> 00:12:09,929
So depending on how you pursue via diegetic

270
00:12:09,969 --> 00:12:11,130
or non-diegetic UI,

271
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:14,454
there are still several other ingredients you can play with

272
00:12:14,494 --> 00:12:16,417
that immerse your world into the UI.

273
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:19,701
Skeuomorphic UI creates a sense of familiarity

274
00:12:19,801 --> 00:12:21,022
by emulating materials,

275
00:12:21,503 --> 00:12:24,046
while flat design stays true to its medium,

276
00:12:24,366 --> 00:12:26,188
often feeling minimal and utilitarian.

277
00:12:28,421 --> 00:12:33,102
But for Blizzard's Hearthstone, the developer commits to a skeuomorphic UI

278
00:12:33,222 --> 00:12:37,403
that enforces their narrative for a player literally playing with cards

279
00:12:37,664 --> 00:12:39,804
in this tavern that's in the game.

280
00:12:40,604 --> 00:12:43,285
The game is a card game, yet through its UI elements,

281
00:12:43,485 --> 00:12:46,426
we are kept in a world that preserves such a narrative

282
00:12:46,806 --> 00:12:48,286
that feels tangible to the user.

283
00:12:50,463 --> 00:12:53,606
And while flat design stays true to its minimal style,

284
00:12:53,927 --> 00:12:57,450
it can help focus the player on what the bigger focus

285
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:58,732
of the world is in the game.

286
00:12:59,252 --> 00:13:01,355
For example, Nintendo's Pokemon Go

287
00:13:01,515 --> 00:13:03,857
solely wants to focus on the Pokemon.

288
00:13:04,038 --> 00:13:07,481
So they aim to keep their UI rather minimal and flat

289
00:13:08,042 --> 00:13:10,645
in order to focus consistently on the Pokemon.

290
00:13:11,593 --> 00:13:15,434
And then you have things like our games like Nintendo's Zelda Breath of the Wild

291
00:13:16,054 --> 00:13:19,315
where the minimal flat design allows the player to focus on Link,

292
00:13:19,475 --> 00:13:23,716
to focus on his inventory, which plays a huge part of the adventurous world within the game.

293
00:13:25,857 --> 00:13:28,877
And while these few examples are extremities,

294
00:13:29,598 --> 00:13:33,098
you often see many games will adopt almost a mixture,

295
00:13:33,219 --> 00:13:37,199
but they do so in a way that tries to complement the world in a consistent manner

296
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,420
and to not look fractured within their UI.

297
00:13:43,474 --> 00:13:45,195
So when going through your exploration,

298
00:13:45,455 --> 00:13:48,618
even testing out designs through a similar visual scale

299
00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:51,221
can help you create a wide variety of choices.

300
00:13:51,721 --> 00:13:53,603
While I tend to do this specific exercise

301
00:13:53,663 --> 00:13:55,966
just with one layout, even different layouts

302
00:13:56,026 --> 00:13:59,329
are worth exploring as well when looking

303
00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:01,291
at the visual scale of each design.

304
00:14:03,845 --> 00:14:08,308
Layout as well has the ability to promote easy usability and world immersion.

305
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:12,912
Within Nintendo's Fire Emblem Heroes, the way they lay out their gacha feature

306
00:14:13,092 --> 00:14:17,436
plays in line with their narrative of using magical stones to summon heroes through a

307
00:14:17,476 --> 00:14:23,280
mystical gateway. The layout of the orbs is not only easy to interact with by simply tapping,

308
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:28,244
but they're also able to clearly explain the benefits of each orb and what kind of hero

309
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,026
you can gain while summoning the stone's hero.

310
00:14:32,192 --> 00:14:34,894
Another fun example is with Dragon Ball Z Dokkan Battle.

311
00:14:35,214 --> 00:14:36,515
When you're about to go into battle,

312
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,176
not only is the screen laid out

313
00:14:38,296 --> 00:14:41,218
in this exciting action-packed manga-inspired layout,

314
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:43,020
but it also clearly communicates

315
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,261
who you are fighting against.

316
00:14:44,961 --> 00:14:46,222
Or even the way that they decide

317
00:14:46,242 --> 00:14:47,423
to display their characters,

318
00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:50,926
that even though it's just about communicating basic stats,

319
00:14:50,966 --> 00:14:52,567
they do so in mimicking

320
00:14:52,687 --> 00:14:54,989
a traditional trading card layout style,

321
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:58,552
which is very familiar to the brand's long history

322
00:14:59,052 --> 00:15:00,093
of selling trading cards.

323
00:15:02,003 --> 00:15:04,565
And then if we even go beyond just static visuals,

324
00:15:04,645 --> 00:15:07,568
but animation, animation of your UI

325
00:15:07,768 --> 00:15:10,630
can still keep the player immersed within the world.

326
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,152
Here in Quantic Dream's Heavy Rain,

327
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:17,455
the developers clearly develop an animation UI

328
00:15:17,675 --> 00:15:20,517
that helps communicate timing urgency of specific commands

329
00:15:20,937 --> 00:15:22,799
that were pinned to their related actions,

330
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,080
such as punching and dodging.

331
00:15:25,547 --> 00:15:27,510
And even with EA's Mirror's Edge,

332
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:30,773
the team was able to use animation with their UI

333
00:15:30,813 --> 00:15:33,316
to not only direct the player in the right direction,

334
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,659
but simultaneously promote the game spirit

335
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:37,201
of being a fast-paced action game.

336
00:15:39,597 --> 00:15:43,822
So, in short, there is so much you can explore in these phases

337
00:15:44,222 --> 00:15:46,144
with just using these four UI elements.

338
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:49,368
When you're trying to figure out how to immerse a game's world into the UI,

339
00:15:50,229 --> 00:15:52,912
just know that variety is king in this phase,

340
00:15:52,972 --> 00:15:55,495
and exploring different varieties of each ingredient

341
00:15:55,575 --> 00:15:57,658
will provide for a wholesome building process.

342
00:15:59,395 --> 00:16:01,957
But then once you've built out these UI options,

343
00:16:02,677 --> 00:16:03,437
how do you pick?

344
00:16:03,998 --> 00:16:07,019
In the iteration phase, you get to decide the balance

345
00:16:07,059 --> 00:16:09,841
between narrative UI and its impact

346
00:16:09,901 --> 00:16:11,501
on the overall user experience.

347
00:16:13,247 --> 00:16:16,149
You've done a bunch of exploration of what your UI can be,

348
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:18,170
but at the end of the day, we need to remember

349
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:22,473
that UI needs to enable interaction with the game's world,

350
00:16:22,993 --> 00:16:23,914
not distract from it.

351
00:16:24,815 --> 00:16:27,176
Sometimes this decision can be very clear,

352
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:31,319
but I have found that focusing on these four main elements

353
00:16:31,739 --> 00:16:35,522
often help me edit, revise, and decide a solid direction

354
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:38,224
when it comes to critical UI visuals for a game.

355
00:16:39,642 --> 00:16:40,243
Readability.

356
00:16:40,963 --> 00:16:43,025
Am I sacrificing readability for style?

357
00:16:43,745 --> 00:16:47,488
Am I looking at the game's info or the info's styling?

358
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:51,612
Consider the risk you could be over-designing your UI.

359
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:54,994
Perhaps due to color or more visual iteration

360
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,415
in a decoration.

361
00:16:57,036 --> 00:16:58,297
You could be distracting the player

362
00:16:58,337 --> 00:16:59,878
from the content you're presenting to them.

363
00:17:01,299 --> 00:17:01,900
Personality.

364
00:17:02,494 --> 00:17:06,076
Can I see my world's keywords when I look at the UI,

365
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:09,298
even without the visual support of characters and environments?

366
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:12,720
What's important to see is in those games,

367
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,762
brands or keywords are visually implied in the design.

368
00:17:15,882 --> 00:17:17,903
So visuals have the ability to stand on their own,

369
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:19,864
but still reflect the game's brand.

370
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:22,245
Implication.

371
00:17:22,265 --> 00:17:24,807
Are interactive elements distinct

372
00:17:24,887 --> 00:17:26,448
from non-interactive elements?

373
00:17:26,948 --> 00:17:29,650
How much can I edit down to a more essential core look?

374
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:34,354
Your UI doesn't have to be literal to your references.

375
00:17:34,974 --> 00:17:37,597
Perhaps color palettes and light iconography

376
00:17:37,797 --> 00:17:39,599
is enough to communicate a brand in a world.

377
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,062
Also, I need to make sure that the player can tell

378
00:17:43,102 --> 00:17:45,104
the difference between interactive objects

379
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,066
and non-interactive objects.

380
00:17:48,728 --> 00:17:49,368
And finally, scale.

381
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:55,930
Does the visual UI language have legs to expand to other UI elements?

382
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,711
Can I scale without breaking the memory bank within the game?

383
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:03,672
Can I possibly scale this distinct look to even perhaps marketing or community assets?

384
00:18:05,052 --> 00:18:09,873
You may find that perhaps some of your ideas, while looking really cool, have a really heavy

385
00:18:09,913 --> 00:18:14,014
memory load or can't even scale, let's say, from a nine-slicing perspective.

386
00:18:15,698 --> 00:18:18,439
So when you look and start to iterate your designs,

387
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:21,380
you just need to be judicious about these four categories.

388
00:18:21,961 --> 00:18:23,821
You need a balance between narrative impact

389
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:24,982
and player usability.

390
00:18:26,262 --> 00:18:27,923
Remember, during our process,

391
00:18:28,003 --> 00:18:30,324
how good UI should enhance and promote

392
00:18:30,364 --> 00:18:32,505
a frictionless experience for a player

393
00:18:32,605 --> 00:18:34,126
and the world they are interacting with.

394
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:38,246
UI is just one of the many visual elements

395
00:18:38,407 --> 00:18:40,089
that can be included in your game.

396
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,393
To enhance the game's world,

397
00:18:42,673 --> 00:18:45,238
and once you have chosen a UI direction,

398
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:48,182
likely you'll need to keep iterating on it too.

399
00:18:50,173 --> 00:18:54,336
And when that happens, it's always good to keep some key principles in mind

400
00:18:54,436 --> 00:18:57,958
to make sure your UI's narrative isn't jeopardizing usability.

401
00:18:58,778 --> 00:19:02,280
As I am creating UI for an entirely new game,

402
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,341
I will always refer to these 10 usability heuristics

403
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:09,964
provided by the Nielsen Norman Group to help me revise my immersive UI.

404
00:19:09,984 --> 00:19:10,044
And...

405
00:19:12,033 --> 00:19:13,815
Even though a lot of the examples I had

406
00:19:13,935 --> 00:19:16,058
were very much console or mobile-based,

407
00:19:16,158 --> 00:19:18,440
I just wanted to give some thoughts on, as well,

408
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,324
of how I can see UI immersion continuing on

409
00:19:21,364 --> 00:19:22,846
with some new mediums within games.

410
00:19:24,047 --> 00:19:26,890
So for AR and UI immersion, I think

411
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:30,134
there's going to be a very interesting balancing act.

412
00:19:31,132 --> 00:19:34,275
Since AR's focus with games will be based on the camera

413
00:19:34,335 --> 00:19:35,836
and real world interactions,

414
00:19:36,076 --> 00:19:38,558
I feel like the user interface will be kept to a minimal

415
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:40,539
to balance out with the camera visuals.

416
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:43,982
Especially if the intent is to blend a player's environment

417
00:19:44,462 --> 00:19:46,083
with game visuals such as characters,

418
00:19:46,724 --> 00:19:48,185
a focus on that experience

419
00:19:48,385 --> 00:19:50,847
would require minimal interface on your screen.

420
00:19:52,668 --> 00:19:53,989
And when it comes to VR,

421
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:57,111
I think that there's a huge opportunity for a diegetic UI.

422
00:19:58,111 --> 00:20:01,954
With VR, the additional access to haptic audio

423
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,876
and animation features that provides good player feedback

424
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:08,059
mechanisms can also be considered for world immersion

425
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:08,699
opportunities.

426
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,601
And you'll also likely need to still

427
00:20:11,641 --> 00:20:13,823
have some kind of visual interface, like type

428
00:20:13,983 --> 00:20:15,764
or perhaps even buttons for accessibility.

429
00:20:16,405 --> 00:20:18,146
But there's going to be some really exciting stuff that

430
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:21,649
goes on, I think, between VR and immersion for UI.

431
00:20:23,397 --> 00:20:27,361
So to conclude, it's really crucial during the entire process

432
00:20:27,581 --> 00:20:32,526
that you keep a very open mind of how you can inject story into your UI.

433
00:20:33,673 --> 00:20:36,994
There are visual ways both diegetic and non-diegetic to do so.

434
00:20:37,614 --> 00:20:41,616
And by doing so, you're going to keep a player immersed in a game's world,

435
00:20:42,096 --> 00:20:44,377
which will be beneficial to your overall brand.

436
00:20:45,097 --> 00:20:47,858
It is just your job as a UI UX designer

437
00:20:48,178 --> 00:20:51,479
to make sure that this UI does not distract from the world.

438
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,880
And you can do that using heuristic principles.

439
00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:00,833
And this is just even more important because we live in a time in a market

440
00:21:00,953 --> 00:21:06,356
where not invest investing in your U I's ability to add on to your brand it to

441
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:10,958
pass up on that opportunity is a mistake. There are so many user interfaces that

442
00:21:11,178 --> 00:21:16,741
are generic and can be mistaken for any other let's say sci-fi game or even any

443
00:21:16,801 --> 00:21:21,684
other farm building game your U I is an opportunity to be as unique as your

444
00:21:21,704 --> 00:21:23,885
games world so take advantage of it.

445
00:21:25,899 --> 00:21:28,881
So if you only take a smidgen away from today's presentation,

446
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,463
here's a few things to remember.

447
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:34,645
To acquire a well-designed immersive UI,

448
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,527
split your process into research, exploration,

449
00:21:37,607 --> 00:21:38,267
and iteration.

450
00:21:39,628 --> 00:21:41,209
And then during your exploration,

451
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:45,112
make sure to test a design out with a variety of designs,

452
00:21:45,232 --> 00:21:46,313
a variety of layouts.

453
00:21:47,213 --> 00:21:50,235
Think about how animation can play a part in your UI.

454
00:21:52,237 --> 00:21:52,917
And then finally,

455
00:21:54,241 --> 00:21:59,828
When you want to decide that balance between your UI's immersion and usability, you can

456
00:21:59,928 --> 00:22:03,133
use these four elements to iterate and improve your UI.

457
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,337
So that's it for me.

458
00:22:06,918 --> 00:22:09,621
Thank you everyone for listening, and hopefully I can take some questions.

459
00:22:26,963 --> 00:22:30,786
First of all, thank you very much for delivering this incredible speech.

460
00:22:31,366 --> 00:22:34,589
Now, with regards to diegetic and non-diegetic UI,

461
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:40,072
I know that there are games that do it fully on one end or the other,

462
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:43,915
and then there are games like the Metro series that kind of have a balance

463
00:22:44,355 --> 00:22:48,318
between that in terms of stealth and objectives for diegetic,

464
00:22:48,858 --> 00:22:53,221
for in-game objects and things like ammo counts, for instance, being...

465
00:22:53,682 --> 00:23:03,068
Non-diegetic, do you think that there's a risk of a conflict between immersion, readability,

466
00:23:03,088 --> 00:23:07,111
and all those aspects that you mentioned when you try to strike a middle ground?

467
00:23:08,692 --> 00:23:13,876
So your question is, is there a risk in going for a more diegetic UI

468
00:23:14,116 --> 00:23:16,298
and risking usability for immersion's sake?

469
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,015
basically if immersion is going to be impacted somewhat if you try to go in the middle, if

470
00:23:22,055 --> 00:23:24,783
you try to incorporate components from both ends.

471
00:23:25,408 --> 00:23:29,589
I would say if you try and strike a balance that's in between those two, you have to do

472
00:23:29,649 --> 00:23:30,809
so in a consistent manner.

473
00:23:31,189 --> 00:23:35,910
And pending on the user task, whether it's something that's really complex, the more

474
00:23:35,991 --> 00:23:39,972
complex a task is, diegetic UI may not be...

475
00:23:40,492 --> 00:23:45,053
Diegetic UI is useful when it feels very first nature to the player.

476
00:23:45,113 --> 00:23:49,854
And so if it's a very complicated task that a user doesn't, say, experience in the real

477
00:23:49,894 --> 00:23:51,915
world, it will be tough.

478
00:23:53,075 --> 00:23:54,215
But you should always explore if you can.

479
00:23:55,422 --> 00:23:56,143
Thank you kindly.

480
00:24:02,271 --> 00:24:02,672
Hi, Steph.

481
00:24:02,712 --> 00:24:03,193
I'm Kevin.

482
00:24:03,313 --> 00:24:04,975
I'm a UX designer at Google Maps.

483
00:24:06,473 --> 00:24:12,117
I love what I do, but I'm really torn when it comes to in-game navigation UI.

484
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:19,722
And one of the things I've always found conflicting was reaching your destination or seeing in

485
00:24:19,762 --> 00:24:26,447
an abstract, simplistic 2D view of your goals or enemies on the map, and sometimes that

486
00:24:26,487 --> 00:24:27,868
would break immersion.

487
00:24:28,729 --> 00:24:31,351
And sometimes I would actually play games very differently,

488
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:33,252
turning off the UI entirely.

489
00:24:33,392 --> 00:24:36,294
Games like Far Cry, Assassin's Creed Syndicate.

490
00:24:36,694 --> 00:24:39,937
My first experience turning off UI was the Radar in Metal Gear Solid 2,

491
00:24:40,057 --> 00:24:41,678
and it completely blew my mind.

492
00:24:41,698 --> 00:24:46,241
I was curious as to if you have any insights,

493
00:24:47,202 --> 00:24:50,944
the balance between reaching your goal and objectives

494
00:24:51,164 --> 00:24:54,046
versus immersion in nav UI.

495
00:24:55,209 --> 00:24:57,771
Right. So in regards to you said Google Maps.

496
00:24:58,151 --> 00:24:59,613
Yeah. Um, so for Google Maps,

497
00:24:59,853 --> 00:25:04,236
I would just turn to the user for your, your answer.

498
00:25:04,456 --> 00:25:06,198
Why is your user using Google Maps?

499
00:25:06,358 --> 00:25:07,699
It's because they're trying to get somewhere.

500
00:25:08,019 --> 00:25:10,861
They're not necessarily looking for an immersive experience,

501
00:25:10,901 --> 00:25:12,042
like let's say with games.

502
00:25:12,543 --> 00:25:17,847
And so I think if being able to optimize for that process of for them,

503
00:25:18,127 --> 00:25:19,608
the experience will be much better if it's.

504
00:25:20,629 --> 00:25:21,670
more clear to them, just like,

505
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,411
I just want to get from point A to point B.

506
00:25:23,892 --> 00:25:26,374
But then it's always thinking about,

507
00:25:26,514 --> 00:25:28,195
I guess you would say, the user's intent

508
00:25:28,255 --> 00:25:29,797
of why they're doing that task.

509
00:25:30,477 --> 00:25:31,238
Okay, cool.

510
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:32,079
Thank you very much.

511
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:32,459
Thank you.

512
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:38,414
Hi, so you mentioned a few times about animated UI elements.

513
00:25:38,515 --> 00:25:41,377
I was just wondering if you had any specific methods or tools

514
00:25:41,397 --> 00:25:44,278
for kind of communicating the intended animation

515
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:46,800
to developers or clients when you're kind of exploring?

516
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,702
Right, yeah, I mean, it really depends on your resources

517
00:25:49,802 --> 00:25:50,383
at that point.

518
00:25:50,483 --> 00:25:52,224
Sometimes, depending on your games team,

519
00:25:52,244 --> 00:25:54,686
you have people who are naturally animators.

520
00:25:54,746 --> 00:25:57,247
Sometimes you have only resources,

521
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,989
let's say, like PowerPoint, right?

522
00:25:59,709 --> 00:26:00,510
And I say that.

523
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:03,552
from, it really depends on your comfort level.

524
00:26:04,033 --> 00:26:06,695
Sometimes even for myself, I will just use

525
00:26:06,755 --> 00:26:09,077
like a quick keynote, pending on the animation,

526
00:26:09,097 --> 00:26:11,399
just to demonstrate, okay, this UI element

527
00:26:11,459 --> 00:26:15,223
should move over here once I acquire this goal.

528
00:26:15,803 --> 00:26:18,145
So I would say it really depends on your resources.

529
00:26:18,165 --> 00:26:18,606
Yeah.

530
00:26:19,346 --> 00:26:19,667
Thanks.

531
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,454
Do you recommend any

532
00:26:28,872 --> 00:26:34,401
practices or pieces of work that new UX designers should try and add to their

533
00:26:34,441 --> 00:26:37,105
portfolio if they're just trying to get into the industry?

534
00:26:38,307 --> 00:26:40,150
Right, I would say...

535
00:26:41,236 --> 00:26:46,861
That's an interesting question and I would say from that perspective, I think the best

536
00:26:46,881 --> 00:26:55,430
thing you can do as a UI designer starting out is just to create your own projects and

537
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:58,833
to do so in a way that I think what's always a lovely demonstration.

538
00:26:59,634 --> 00:27:01,596
is when you show something like a game HUD

539
00:27:01,776 --> 00:27:03,418
and a character profile screen

540
00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:06,402
because that demonstrates your skill of layout,

541
00:27:06,582 --> 00:27:08,925
your skill of colors and typography,

542
00:27:08,945 --> 00:27:10,828
and you wanna be able to tell them

543
00:27:10,888 --> 00:27:13,631
that you can balance in between screens

544
00:27:13,671 --> 00:27:15,894
that have a lot of information that needs to be digested

545
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:17,656
versus very minimal information.

546
00:27:17,676 --> 00:27:18,497
Thank you.

547
00:27:25,961 --> 00:27:27,983
So does localization ever play a factor?

548
00:27:28,003 --> 00:27:29,785
I know in my personal experience, I have artists

549
00:27:29,825 --> 00:27:32,207
pick great fonts that fit the world, and they don't have any

550
00:27:32,267 --> 00:27:34,349
European characters, so we can't localize.

551
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,851
And maybe on the flip side, you need to do something like

552
00:27:36,891 --> 00:27:40,675
an IKEA manual that there's no text at all, but that might

553
00:27:40,715 --> 00:27:41,196
fit the world.

554
00:27:42,307 --> 00:27:43,188
That's a really good question.

555
00:27:43,248 --> 00:27:44,789
So in terms of localization,

556
00:27:44,849 --> 00:27:46,731
I think from an exploration perspective,

557
00:27:46,851 --> 00:27:49,914
you should be, when you're creating these UI screens,

558
00:27:50,155 --> 00:27:51,656
it should be very inspirational.

559
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,258
And so from that perspective,

560
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:57,902
you should try and find fonts that feel true to your brand.

561
00:27:58,002 --> 00:27:59,724
But then, and then afterwards,

562
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:03,268
you can take that as kind of your goal

563
00:28:03,588 --> 00:28:05,530
and then look at fonts that are.

564
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:09,854
that are able to be like localized for your game.

565
00:28:09,914 --> 00:28:13,497
And so I would say for your research and exploration part,

566
00:28:13,837 --> 00:28:16,579
you just look at what you feel like is the best font.

567
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:20,002
And then after that, you go into localization fonts

568
00:28:20,022 --> 00:28:23,345
and then work with your font vendor

569
00:28:23,505 --> 00:28:25,587
to see which font will match closest to it.

570
00:28:30,448 --> 00:28:36,432
Do you have any, like, ideas or guidelines or recommendations for, say, user interfaces

571
00:28:36,472 --> 00:28:41,917
and user experience in games or immersive environments where there isn't necessarily

572
00:28:41,937 --> 00:28:42,677
a fourth wall?

573
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:47,244
where instead of playing a character, you are more or less the character in something

574
00:28:47,264 --> 00:28:51,849
that is either slightly augmented reality or an alternate reality that is still making

575
00:28:51,949 --> 00:28:53,090
callbacks to the current reality.

576
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:58,476
A lot of what I like to do is in those situations where there is a little bit of a blur between

577
00:28:58,956 --> 00:29:02,500
game reality and reality, so UX and UI there for me gets a little...

578
00:29:03,601 --> 00:29:10,127
confusing because I'm not quite sure what to do because there's not really a

579
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:15,092
fourth wall and the only information presented to you is entirely separate

580
00:29:15,952 --> 00:29:18,735
and also the same as the character as you are the character

581
00:29:19,981 --> 00:29:25,582
Right, so in that respect, I would say that it depends on your game's nature, right?

582
00:29:25,622 --> 00:29:32,064
If it's a very story-driven game, then I think that you want to not necessarily, like UI is important,

583
00:29:32,084 --> 00:29:35,825
but then you want to make sure it's not distracting as well from the main experience.

584
00:29:35,845 --> 00:29:39,746
So especially if you're doing something like mixed reality, augmented reality,

585
00:29:39,886 --> 00:29:44,107
I would say that you want, if anything, you want user interface at that point to be very minimal.

586
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:48,968
In terms of resources, I would say just being able to...

587
00:29:51,709 --> 00:29:57,231
Really being able to, I think, research about just like any other games that have been working on it,

588
00:29:57,251 --> 00:29:59,492
just seeing their findings as well would be a good idea.

589
00:29:59,512 --> 00:30:05,794
Because especially with AR, there's going to be new usability issues that

590
00:30:06,094 --> 00:30:09,915
you're going to be finding yourself. So it's a whole process, I think.

591
00:30:11,516 --> 00:30:11,756
Thank you.

592
00:30:15,744 --> 00:30:19,027
And I think actually we're out of time right now.

593
00:30:19,168 --> 00:30:23,052
And so I'll be just on the side if you have more questions.

594
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,734
And thank you so much for listening.
