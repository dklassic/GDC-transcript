00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,364
Hello everyone. Sorry for the delay there.

2
00:00:10,384 --> 00:00:13,467
Alright, so the year is 1993.

3
00:00:13,507 --> 00:00:17,471
Let me set the mood. One sec. Alright, there we go.

4
00:00:17,491 --> 00:00:20,374
The year is 1993. I'm 16 years old. I'm a junior in high school.

5
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,432
The world of graphic design is insane.

6
00:00:27,913 --> 00:00:29,475
My father, who worked at IBM at the time,

7
00:00:29,955 --> 00:00:32,037
was invited to take a tour of Citizen Hall

8
00:00:32,437 --> 00:00:34,299
at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,

9
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,463
which at that time was a leading institution in R&D

10
00:00:38,563 --> 00:00:39,904
of a thing called virtual reality.

11
00:00:42,106 --> 00:00:43,947
Here's what a poster looked like from around that era.

12
00:00:45,569 --> 00:00:46,750
That is actually from UNC.

13
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:49,252
And that is pretty much what the 90s looked like.

14
00:00:51,308 --> 00:00:54,631
Being a high schooler, I was at that time playing games every day,

15
00:00:55,371 --> 00:00:58,153
like Castle Wolfenstein 3D, Syndicate.

16
00:00:59,534 --> 00:01:02,436
And on this tour, I got to see a lot of neat applications for VR.

17
00:01:02,837 --> 00:01:05,879
But the demo that I remember the most was of a molecule.

18
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,661
So you basically put on this, like, 14-pound helmet,

19
00:01:09,642 --> 00:01:12,624
and you can look at the molecular structure of an organic compound.

20
00:01:13,525 --> 00:01:15,466
And actually, if we look back at this poster here...

21
00:01:16,474 --> 00:01:18,596
That right there is what I saw in VR.

22
00:01:19,617 --> 00:01:23,141
And if you think that it looks like some colored spheres

23
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:24,642
with rudimentary lighting, you would be correct.

24
00:01:26,384 --> 00:01:28,826
So I probably was not as impressed with this demo

25
00:01:29,227 --> 00:01:30,448
as maybe I should have been at that time.

26
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:32,730
Last for a couple of years,

27
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,592
Nintendo brings us into the future in 1995.

28
00:01:34,672 --> 00:01:35,653
It looks something like this.

29
00:01:38,513 --> 00:01:40,574
And of course, inside it looks like this.

30
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,196
So, fighting giant robots, right?

31
00:01:44,236 --> 00:01:45,457
Back in the mid-90s, we were all about

32
00:01:45,477 --> 00:01:46,257
fighting giant robots.

33
00:01:48,498 --> 00:01:50,239
Also, I was a little less than impressed

34
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:51,760
with this particular experience.

35
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:54,622
If we fast forward to GDC 2013,

36
00:01:54,762 --> 00:01:57,183
this is where I had my first opportunity

37
00:01:57,243 --> 00:01:59,364
to try out a device called the Oculus Rift.

38
00:01:59,824 --> 00:02:01,265
It's an early generation version.

39
00:02:01,545 --> 00:02:02,566
This is a DK1, I believe.

40
00:02:03,506 --> 00:02:05,488
And it looks something like that.

41
00:02:06,482 --> 00:02:07,423
It's fighting giant robots.

42
00:02:08,203 --> 00:02:11,345
So back in the mid-2010s, we were all about fighting giant robots.

43
00:02:12,726 --> 00:02:13,486
This game was Hawken.

44
00:02:14,787 --> 00:02:16,448
And I remember when I put the headset on,

45
00:02:16,488 --> 00:02:18,269
my first thought was, I really hope no one's

46
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:19,289
taking a picture of me right now.

47
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,531
It was a cool experience piloting a mech.

48
00:02:23,671 --> 00:02:24,172
It's got guns.

49
00:02:24,192 --> 00:02:24,892
It's got jump jets.

50
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:31,334
I thought I was going to be fairly clever and ambush some of my fellow demo players.

51
00:02:32,254 --> 00:02:36,536
So I jumped up onto a roof and I did the thing that you would do if you're up on a roof going

52
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:39,678
to ambush people below you, which is I walked over to the edge and I looked down.

53
00:02:42,859 --> 00:02:49,522
The reaction was immediate and sort of physical, visceral, fear of falling.

54
00:02:50,382 --> 00:02:52,783
So my reaction was, of course, I wanted to back up.

55
00:02:53,843 --> 00:02:56,385
And it was at that moment that I realized that something had changed,

56
00:02:57,005 --> 00:03:01,308
and that 20 years of promises of VR were finally being made good,

57
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:03,510
and that VR had arrived.

58
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:06,973
Which sort of brings me to today and to this lecture,

59
00:03:07,753 --> 00:03:11,416
which is Punch It Up! Writing for Star Trek in VR.

60
00:03:12,617 --> 00:03:15,379
And by which I mean, of course, the Star Trek is in VR, not the writing part.

61
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,262
It probably would be cool to write in VR, but we're not quite there yet.

62
00:03:20,123 --> 00:03:22,105
So, obligatory bio.

63
00:03:23,408 --> 00:03:28,069
I am Jay Posey, I am an expert narrative designer at Ubisoft, at Red Storm Entertainment.

64
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,150
That is actually my title, that's not just something I put on LinkedIn.

65
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:34,692
I've been there for a little over 12 years.

66
00:03:35,332 --> 00:03:37,052
Started in game development in 1998, so kind of old.

67
00:03:39,676 --> 00:03:41,177
I'm also a traditionally published author.

68
00:03:41,738 --> 00:03:42,959
My fifth novel will be out this summer.

69
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,480
And I actually got my start as a screenwriter,

70
00:03:46,401 --> 00:03:48,382
doing script development for a Hollywood producer.

71
00:03:49,003 --> 00:03:50,744
So all that is just to say,

72
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:52,806
I've had the opportunity to work in a lot of different media.

73
00:03:53,726 --> 00:03:55,427
And I'm genuinely excited about VR

74
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:57,429
and about the opportunity that it is affording us,

75
00:03:58,129 --> 00:03:59,931
that the technology is open for storytelling.

76
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:02,973
I think there's a lot of new experiences out there for us to discover.

77
00:04:03,673 --> 00:04:05,615
And I'm really looking forward to doing some of that.

78
00:04:07,017 --> 00:04:08,439
All right, so finally, Star Trek.

79
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,482
Has anybody in here actually gotten to try a demo

80
00:04:11,822 --> 00:04:13,003
of Bridge Crew yet?

81
00:04:13,023 --> 00:04:13,824
A couple people?

82
00:04:14,144 --> 00:04:14,585
OK, good.

83
00:04:14,705 --> 00:04:16,307
Yes, Mr. Dansky in the back, back there.

84
00:04:16,447 --> 00:04:17,688
Very good.

85
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:21,412
So for those of you who haven't got a chance to check it out,

86
00:04:21,792 --> 00:04:22,433
very quick primer.

87
00:04:23,276 --> 00:04:26,917
You play as one of four officers on the bridge of the USS Aegis,

88
00:04:26,977 --> 00:04:31,058
which is a brand new ship that we created in conjunction with CBS just for this game.

89
00:04:31,078 --> 00:04:33,319
So you're up there.

90
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:38,080
And you're exploring sort of a poorly understood section of space called the trench.

91
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,541
And of course, awesome and exciting things happen.

92
00:04:42,721 --> 00:04:44,482
Our four officers are the helm officer.

93
00:04:45,324 --> 00:04:48,487
We have the pilot who pilots the ship and manages impulse and warp travel.

94
00:04:49,668 --> 00:04:53,753
We have the tactical officer who operates weapons, shields, and scanners.

95
00:04:54,874 --> 00:04:58,318
We have our trusty engineer who distributes and reroutes power

96
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,901
and then if it's ever necessary manages repairs.

97
00:05:02,143 --> 00:05:04,325
And of course we have the captain who just tells everyone what to do.

98
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:08,845
And if playtesting is any indication, also constantly turns red alert on and off.

99
00:05:10,086 --> 00:05:15,192
You can actually see in this image the red lighting is of course because red alert is on,

100
00:05:15,372 --> 00:05:17,615
which is probably because it hadn't been on in like 30 seconds.

101
00:05:19,697 --> 00:05:23,341
So I wanted to take a little bit of a different approach from usual with this talk,

102
00:05:23,361 --> 00:05:25,824
so it's not going to be kind of the three bullet points of lessons learned.

103
00:05:26,444 --> 00:05:31,625
It's really more of a high-level survey of some of the challenges that we ran into developing

104
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:35,126
and writing specifically for VR, and then some of the solutions that we came up with.

105
00:05:36,506 --> 00:05:40,167
That being said, here are three bullet points to tie all these things together.

106
00:05:40,227 --> 00:05:44,508
So I want to talk about presence, talk about franchise, and talk about cooperation.

107
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:50,490
So each of the topics that I cover in my remaining two and a half hours are going to touch on

108
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,430
one or more of these pillars.

109
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,411
So I'm just going to quickly define what I mean by them.

110
00:05:56,665 --> 00:05:57,607
First off, presence.

111
00:05:58,809 --> 00:06:02,596
How many people have tried VR at all of any of the current hardware?

112
00:06:02,717 --> 00:06:03,157
Okay, good.

113
00:06:03,338 --> 00:06:03,919
Most everybody.

114
00:06:06,183 --> 00:06:08,548
If you haven't had a chance to, I definitely recommend.

115
00:06:09,383 --> 00:06:12,745
Give it a try, take advantage of the expo floor.

116
00:06:12,765 --> 00:06:13,765
I'm sure we'll have demos out there.

117
00:06:14,826 --> 00:06:16,867
Primarily because the experience is very difficult

118
00:06:17,027 --> 00:06:19,169
to describe if you haven't really seen it for yourself.

119
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:21,510
So I've got some screenshots up here that we'll go through.

120
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:25,752
But they really don't do justice to the VR experience.

121
00:06:27,113 --> 00:06:27,933
We're talking about presence.

122
00:06:29,474 --> 00:06:30,994
As game devs, we talk a lot about immersion,

123
00:06:31,734 --> 00:06:34,715
which basically is just engaging our players enough

124
00:06:34,755 --> 00:06:37,036
so that controllers and screens disappear,

125
00:06:37,376 --> 00:06:40,456
and we're really engrossing our players in the created world.

126
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:42,917
It turns out with VR, that's practically free.

127
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:46,338
And it's much stronger in VR, so we call that presence.

128
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,399
That's why I had such a strong fear reaction in Hawken.

129
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:53,679
And you're really no longer just seeing and hearing things,

130
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:55,979
but you have this sense that you've brought your physical

131
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:57,700
body into the space with you.

132
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,981
So that's what I'm talking about when I talk about presence.

133
00:07:03,341 --> 00:07:06,601
Secondly, franchise, Star Trek just celebrated its 50th

134
00:07:06,621 --> 00:07:08,002
anniversary last year.

135
00:07:08,482 --> 00:07:11,422
So that's 50 years of TV, movies, books, comic books,

136
00:07:11,642 --> 00:07:13,543
video games, fan fiction.

137
00:07:13,563 --> 00:07:16,763
And I don't know if you're all aware of it, but Star Trek has

138
00:07:17,023 --> 00:07:17,563
several fans.

139
00:07:18,124 --> 00:07:19,124
Sometimes they have opinions.

140
00:07:21,082 --> 00:07:27,705
So that was really a mountain of content for us to kind of pour through and try to condense into this VR game.

141
00:07:28,405 --> 00:07:31,807
So it presented some challenges, but it also turned out to be a source of a lot of our solutions.

142
00:07:32,127 --> 00:07:33,047
So I'll touch on that too.

143
00:07:35,048 --> 00:07:35,348
Franchise.

144
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,269
And finally, cooperation.

145
00:07:38,372 --> 00:07:40,093
And I know this picture is a little bit creepy,

146
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:42,133
but this was literally the only one I could find

147
00:07:42,173 --> 00:07:43,394
on the internet about cooperation

148
00:07:43,434 --> 00:07:45,795
that wasn't just a bunch of hands on top of each other.

149
00:07:46,495 --> 00:07:49,316
So, okay, fine, we'll use the hands.

150
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:50,356
That's fine.

151
00:07:51,997 --> 00:07:54,097
So Star Trek Bridge Crew was really designed

152
00:07:54,157 --> 00:07:55,638
as a social VR game first.

153
00:07:56,318 --> 00:07:59,559
So you can play solo, but we intended it primarily

154
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:01,500
and we designed it primarily as a multiplayer game.

155
00:08:02,891 --> 00:08:05,612
And it was really important for us to foster an environment

156
00:08:05,632 --> 00:08:08,114
of cooperation, both for the gameplay but also

157
00:08:08,274 --> 00:08:09,655
for the narrative and for the franchise.

158
00:08:09,835 --> 00:08:12,557
It just seemed appropriate for this franchise.

159
00:08:12,597 --> 00:08:13,497
So we'll touch on that.

160
00:08:15,098 --> 00:08:18,520
And I'm going to use these sort of three images just

161
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,542
as keys going forward, mostly because I'm old

162
00:08:21,582 --> 00:08:23,203
and pictures help me remember what I'm talking about.

163
00:08:24,425 --> 00:08:26,108
All right, so first off, pacing.

164
00:08:26,648 --> 00:08:28,391
It's not really new for narrative, obviously,

165
00:08:29,032 --> 00:08:30,854
but I wanted to touch on it because this is one

166
00:08:30,874 --> 00:08:33,097
of the big lessons that I learned working in VR.

167
00:08:34,319 --> 00:08:36,022
Not because it was a surprise to us.

168
00:08:36,102 --> 00:08:37,704
We obviously knew we had to consider it,

169
00:08:37,764 --> 00:08:39,747
but we just didn't know how different

170
00:08:39,807 --> 00:08:40,748
it was going to be in VR.

171
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:46,310
As game devs, we're always very concerned

172
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,530
about keeping our players engaged.

173
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,091
There are lots of different ways to do that.

174
00:08:49,131 --> 00:08:51,051
There's sort of the call of duty model of spectacle.

175
00:08:51,691 --> 00:08:53,172
As long as you continue moving forward,

176
00:08:53,192 --> 00:08:54,332
you're going to see awesome things.

177
00:08:55,032 --> 00:08:56,973
So it's kind of a thrill ride mechanic.

178
00:08:57,493 --> 00:08:59,973
There's the more open world model

179
00:09:00,253 --> 00:09:02,214
of a Far Cry or Assassin's Creed

180
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,754
where you have a wealth of choices to choose from.

181
00:09:04,894 --> 00:09:07,635
So it's player directed, but they can always open up a menu

182
00:09:07,675 --> 00:09:10,536
and see any number of things that they can do.

183
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,316
And obviously we never want our players to get bored.

184
00:09:13,896 --> 00:09:15,837
So this is something that we brought a lot of our previous

185
00:09:15,877 --> 00:09:18,357
experience of designing more traditional games.

186
00:09:19,198 --> 00:09:21,538
And we're always very concerned about perceived downtime.

187
00:09:21,578 --> 00:09:23,819
So things like traveling between objectives, we wanted

188
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,539
to make sure that players always felt like they were

189
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:27,619
kind of in the middle of the action.

190
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,900
But our main menu actually taught us a

191
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,700
really important lesson.

192
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,661
So I'm going to pop up some screenshots

193
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:33,781
here of our main menu.

194
00:09:34,521 --> 00:09:36,481
And you can see just down there in the corner, that is

195
00:09:36,521 --> 00:09:36,942
our main menu.

196
00:09:37,662 --> 00:09:39,902
When you first load into Star Trek, bridge crew.

197
00:09:40,842 --> 00:09:42,546
You start in an inspection shuttle.

198
00:09:43,087 --> 00:09:45,292
You kind of come out around this space shuttle,

199
00:09:45,693 --> 00:09:47,156
space shuttle, come around the space station

200
00:09:47,858 --> 00:09:50,904
and do this lazy orbit around the ship.

201
00:09:51,763 --> 00:09:53,664
And that will continue for as long as you want to sit in there.

202
00:09:54,305 --> 00:09:56,226
And of course, being devs, we hop in there and we kind of

203
00:09:57,027 --> 00:09:58,628
boop our way around real quick and we're into the next,

204
00:09:59,008 --> 00:09:59,869
kind of on to the next thing.

205
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:02,390
But as we started taking this out to the public

206
00:10:02,711 --> 00:10:04,112
and started giving demos,

207
00:10:04,552 --> 00:10:06,513
we found that players were wanting to spend

208
00:10:06,553 --> 00:10:09,175
three, five, seven, ten minutes

209
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,217
just sitting in the shuttle.

210
00:10:11,937 --> 00:10:14,139
And one of our guys that ran a lot of these demos,

211
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:16,360
actually not once, but on two separate occasions,

212
00:10:16,981 --> 00:10:18,662
had people who had to take their headsets off

213
00:10:18,742 --> 00:10:20,003
to wipe tears from their eyes.

214
00:10:20,997 --> 00:10:24,018
Because they were just so emotionally excited

215
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:26,419
and overwhelmed by this opportunity.

216
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:28,800
So, you know, and this is just our main menu, right?

217
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,782
So that really, really surprised us

218
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,183
at just the emotional impact that this,

219
00:10:35,743 --> 00:10:37,564
you know, this franchise has on people.

220
00:10:37,744 --> 00:10:39,825
And literally this is a dream come true for some people

221
00:10:39,865 --> 00:10:41,505
when they put that headset on and they feel like

222
00:10:41,545 --> 00:10:44,587
they are literally on the bridge of this starship.

223
00:10:45,047 --> 00:10:46,227
And so that really opened our eyes

224
00:10:46,287 --> 00:10:47,988
to how much we needed to respect

225
00:10:49,454 --> 00:10:52,055
and give people breathing room to really fully experience

226
00:10:52,095 --> 00:10:54,035
and appreciate the experience that they were having.

227
00:10:54,995 --> 00:10:58,016
So we kind of had to resist some of our natural urges

228
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:01,497
to pressure, put pressure on players

229
00:11:01,677 --> 00:11:04,818
or to kind of distract them with other things.

230
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:08,399
And that also impacted how many moments of kind of narrative

231
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:10,259
that we needed to push on people.

232
00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:12,860
Because sometimes just sitting there on the bridge

233
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,380
and looking at space is apparently enough

234
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:17,461
to capture that experience.

235
00:11:18,652 --> 00:11:20,013
Of course, that impacts storytelling.

236
00:11:20,773 --> 00:11:22,734
And when I say storytelling, I mean the actual mechanics

237
00:11:22,774 --> 00:11:24,995
that we use to deliver narrative information.

238
00:11:26,256 --> 00:11:27,476
So there's this well-known

239
00:11:27,536 --> 00:11:30,138
and generally accepted solution in games,

240
00:11:30,658 --> 00:11:32,339
which is basically having some authority figure

241
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,540
somewhere far away telling you everything you need to know.

242
00:11:35,646 --> 00:11:38,890
Good news is Star Trek franchise gave us a great solution for this.

243
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:42,655
And that was the Starfleet Admiral on the B-screen.

244
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,319
And sorry for the slight tilt.

245
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:46,921
I actually took this while I was in a headset.

246
00:11:47,181 --> 00:11:51,526
And of course because the headset adjusts with you, I didn't realize my head was tilted slightly.

247
00:11:51,647 --> 00:11:52,007
But anyway.

248
00:11:53,401 --> 00:12:00,586
So the Starfleet Admiral, people talking to you on the view screen is across pretty much all Star Trek properties at some point.

249
00:12:00,606 --> 00:12:07,031
So that was great for us. It was kind of a good way that we could use the franchise to do something that we always do in video games.

250
00:12:07,631 --> 00:12:11,013
Bad news is, in a shared virtual environment, no one wants to listen to a talking head.

251
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:17,552
So, when you have multiple people in VR and that sense that you are all there together

252
00:12:17,592 --> 00:12:20,394
in the shared virtual environment is so strong.

253
00:12:20,434 --> 00:12:26,498
I think the contrast between natural human interaction and some guy on a screen talking

254
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:31,581
to you who's clearly not a human is just so stark that this method of delivering information

255
00:12:31,601 --> 00:12:36,685
is just not as compelling or really as acceptable as it might have become in sort of traditional

256
00:12:36,705 --> 00:12:38,046
media, other games.

257
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:42,192
So this is something that we had to really evaluate and think about.

258
00:12:42,973 --> 00:12:46,395
And our Admiral does show up a couple of times, but it's something that we've used pretty sparingly.

259
00:12:47,015 --> 00:12:48,856
And generally only for high-level information.

260
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:53,319
So it was kind of story information from back home that you couldn't really get any other way.

261
00:12:54,319 --> 00:12:56,641
And it felt appropriate, the way we're using it,

262
00:12:56,861 --> 00:12:59,783
but we just couldn't rely on it as much as we might have otherwise.

263
00:13:00,651 --> 00:13:01,892
So that left us with a couple of needs.

264
00:13:02,613 --> 00:13:06,718
One was to provide narrative context for missions and for moment-to-moment gameplay.

265
00:13:07,478 --> 00:13:09,621
And then the other was just for directing player action.

266
00:13:12,336 --> 00:13:14,318
The first point, the narrative context.

267
00:13:14,819 --> 00:13:16,861
Again, the Star Trek franchise really came through for us

268
00:13:16,901 --> 00:13:19,103
and gave us a gift, and that was the captain's log.

269
00:13:19,904 --> 00:13:22,307
So each of our missions starts with a captain's log,

270
00:13:22,327 --> 00:13:24,029
which is really just an establishing shot,

271
00:13:24,469 --> 00:13:25,650
the voiceover from a captain.

272
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:28,173
This was great for us because it really roots

273
00:13:28,233 --> 00:13:31,096
the experience of this game in something that's familiar

274
00:13:31,237 --> 00:13:32,418
and iconic from the franchise.

275
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:35,220
So it was a good fit for us.

276
00:13:36,301 --> 00:13:39,003
It also allows us to provide narrative context

277
00:13:39,063 --> 00:13:40,164
from missions before.

278
00:13:40,764 --> 00:13:43,386
So it can kind of serve as a reminder of, you know,

279
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:46,789
what you did earlier and also the results of those actions.

280
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,831
And then also, of course, sets up our coming mission.

281
00:13:49,851 --> 00:13:51,592
So it kind of gives you a little idea of what you're in for.

282
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:57,131
From a traditional game writing standpoint, this isn't really a surprise, right?

283
00:13:57,151 --> 00:13:58,152
This is kind of a cinematic.

284
00:13:58,252 --> 00:13:59,172
We've been using these forever.

285
00:13:59,192 --> 00:14:03,433
The thing that was interesting to me about this was that it works in VR.

286
00:14:04,554 --> 00:14:10,536
And actually players seem to be more receptive to narrative information in this format than

287
00:14:10,556 --> 00:14:12,836
they were from a guy on a screen talking to them.

288
00:14:14,197 --> 00:14:16,098
And obviously this is anecdotal.

289
00:14:16,418 --> 00:14:17,999
I think it's worth exploring though.

290
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:20,700
Maybe this is due to some sort of observer effect

291
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,241
where people have a natural sense

292
00:14:22,281 --> 00:14:25,082
of whether they're inhabiting a camera versus an avatar.

293
00:14:26,603 --> 00:14:29,844
Or if it's just this is a familiar framing device

294
00:14:29,904 --> 00:14:31,405
and so people kind of go into the,

295
00:14:31,565 --> 00:14:33,826
oh, I'm watching movie slash TV now.

296
00:14:33,926 --> 00:14:34,066
So.

297
00:14:35,287 --> 00:14:36,748
I'm kind of in a more passive mode.

298
00:14:37,949 --> 00:14:38,509
I don't really know.

299
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:43,273
This is kind of a hypothesis right now, but this was a good solution for us for the narrative

300
00:14:43,313 --> 00:14:43,773
context.

301
00:14:44,774 --> 00:14:49,317
It still left for us the second challenge of directing player action, of making sure

302
00:14:49,357 --> 00:14:51,258
that players had critical mission information.

303
00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:54,441
And here we decided to take a little bit of a risk.

304
00:14:54,841 --> 00:15:00,024
And that was entrusting our captains, actually, to help us as storytellers.

305
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,395
Which is of course meaning we're trusting a human player

306
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:07,797
to actually pull information and then share that with the crew

307
00:15:08,318 --> 00:15:10,919
and do it in a way that contributes to the overall narrative experience.

308
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:14,521
So if you look here on the armrest of the captain's chair,

309
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,862
there's Captain Edwards, you can see some little buttons.

310
00:15:18,997 --> 00:15:22,681
So the captain actually has a UI that they can bring up all these different screens

311
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:23,661
and get information.

312
00:15:24,462 --> 00:15:27,124
And some of it is privileged information that no one else gets.

313
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:33,089
So not only do we have sort of outlining mission goals and requirements, there are also hints

314
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:38,374
or optional ways to complete objectives or things that you would really have no other

315
00:15:38,414 --> 00:15:43,098
way to know, like the, you know, damage radius of a warp core breach, things like that.

316
00:15:44,616 --> 00:15:47,662
Internally, we sort of couched this as the captain's experience.

317
00:15:48,283 --> 00:15:51,669
And this was sort of our way of thinking, you know, if you're a captain in Starfleet

318
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:56,138
and you're responsible for an entire starship, you've probably been around for a while, you've

319
00:15:56,158 --> 00:15:57,160
probably seen some stuff.

320
00:15:57,904 --> 00:15:59,664
So this was really our way of letting new players kind

321
00:15:59,684 --> 00:16:01,385
of benefit from those years of experience

322
00:16:01,405 --> 00:16:04,746
that they don't actually have, kind of getting that from this UI.

323
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:08,367
That did mean for us that it was up to the captain to communicate

324
00:16:08,407 --> 00:16:09,508
and coordinate with the crew.

325
00:16:10,468 --> 00:16:14,150
And in some situations, there's not clearly a right answer

326
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,010
for solving a situation.

327
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,911
So it's sort of the classic, you know,

328
00:16:17,931 --> 00:16:19,152
do you risk your own crew members

329
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:20,972
to rescue some civilians in harm's way?

330
00:16:22,013 --> 00:16:23,893
And it's really up to the captain to make that sort of decision.

331
00:16:24,986 --> 00:16:26,167
The good news is it seems to have paid off.

332
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,569
So from play testing and iterating on that stuff,

333
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,130
turns out that good captains,

334
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,553
people who are decisive and kind of know what they're doing,

335
00:16:35,314 --> 00:16:36,074
make for great crews.

336
00:16:36,715 --> 00:16:39,917
It's been really interesting to see when captains,

337
00:16:39,937 --> 00:16:42,539
you know, we bring in four people who've never met before,

338
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:45,221
and you see somebody really embrace that captain's role,

339
00:16:45,721 --> 00:16:47,623
and the other three players who don't know this guy

340
00:16:48,123 --> 00:16:50,985
still seem to kind of come together under that authority.

341
00:16:51,665 --> 00:16:53,527
and really buy into the experience.

342
00:16:53,547 --> 00:16:55,068
And it's really, really cool to see that happen.

343
00:16:56,429 --> 00:16:58,251
And as I said, of course, there was a bit of a risk

344
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,073
because when you get this guy,

345
00:17:03,215 --> 00:17:06,418
you end up with a less than ideal experience.

346
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,422
So, that was one thing that we really had to work on

347
00:17:11,682 --> 00:17:12,143
quite a bit.

348
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:17,815
A lot of this came down to, we went through a lot of iterations about what kind of information

349
00:17:17,855 --> 00:17:22,400
do we present to the captain, how do we present it, how do we write it so that it's digestible

350
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,587
and then players can read from here and parrot that back and sound authoritative.

351
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:29,989
So some of that stuff has helped out.

352
00:17:31,811 --> 00:17:37,573
And, again, you know, that was the interesting, another interesting thing about this is I

353
00:17:37,613 --> 00:17:42,355
think we're requiring a lot from our captains to pull information to go find it and synthesize

354
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:42,995
it and share it.

355
00:17:43,676 --> 00:17:47,317
And we as an industry have done a pretty great job of training players to be very passive

356
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:50,258
and just sort of like sit here and wait until we tell you exactly what to do.

357
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:52,880
You know, hey, the room you're in is on fire.

358
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,620
You should find a way to escape kind of thing.

359
00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:00,133
So we had to go through a lot of iteration to figure out how do we train our captain players

360
00:18:00,194 --> 00:18:03,377
to understand that, oh, wait, I'm responsible for making these calls

361
00:18:03,637 --> 00:18:04,738
and for driving our gameplay.

362
00:18:05,939 --> 00:18:07,621
So we're leaning pretty heavily on our captains.

363
00:18:08,676 --> 00:18:10,077
But it's not all about captains, obviously.

364
00:18:10,497 --> 00:18:14,461
Our entire player crew really participates in sort of that moment-to-moment story experience.

365
00:18:15,842 --> 00:18:17,944
And so it was very important for us to...

366
00:18:18,605 --> 00:18:19,466
Sorry about the ant picture there.

367
00:18:20,087 --> 00:18:23,750
It was very important for us to continually bring our thinking back to the cooperation of the crew

368
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:28,094
and to really capture that proper experience of all of us working together.

369
00:18:29,363 --> 00:18:34,024
In case you couldn't tell from the name, really the heart of Star Trek Bridge Crew is the crew.

370
00:18:34,604 --> 00:18:34,924
Shocking.

371
00:18:36,105 --> 00:18:40,566
And so we really wanted to create a narrative experience of sort of this trustworthy crew

372
00:18:40,726 --> 00:18:41,266
off the leash.

373
00:18:43,127 --> 00:18:47,588
Which just means that Starfleet has already checked you guys out and yep, we trust you

374
00:18:47,608 --> 00:18:51,269
to go off into the reaches of space and represent us and do a good job.

375
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:58,835
So I also wanted to empower players with a sense of responsibility that they were out there to do the proper things.

376
00:19:00,817 --> 00:19:05,401
And this is one of the reasons I think that the constant updates from Starfleet, the Starfleet Admiral, felt wrong.

377
00:19:05,621 --> 00:19:14,008
Because it gave you the sense that Starfleet was always watching you and, you know, waiting for you to make a mistake or not trusting you completely.

378
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,550
So that was another thing we had to work on.

379
00:19:17,651 --> 00:19:21,473
And spotlighting was something that we settled on.

380
00:19:22,174 --> 00:19:26,076
Where our mission designs really provide challenges specifically designed

381
00:19:26,156 --> 00:19:31,339
for one officer or more commonly for a pairing of officers to kind

382
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:35,521
of give them a chance to be the hero for a particular thing.

383
00:19:35,621 --> 00:19:39,663
So instead of every player feeling like they are the hero of this story,

384
00:19:40,004 --> 00:19:43,125
kind of everyone's taking it in turn to be the hero of this moment.

385
00:19:43,903 --> 00:19:47,966
Which I think feels authentic to the franchise where you've got sort of the episode where it's,

386
00:19:48,006 --> 00:19:51,567
you know, the science officer is figuring things out, or the engineer,

387
00:19:51,687 --> 00:19:52,968
or people working together.

388
00:19:52,988 --> 00:19:59,191
So, you know, a very simple example in our game, there's a mission where you start out,

389
00:19:59,211 --> 00:20:02,633
the ship is damaged, and you are being pursued by enemy forces.

390
00:20:02,693 --> 00:20:06,355
So it's really up to the helm officer to coordinate.

391
00:20:07,535 --> 00:20:10,876
with the engineer to figure out sort of how much power they need, you know,

392
00:20:10,896 --> 00:20:13,397
when they should make a run for it and when they should kind of hide out

393
00:20:13,437 --> 00:20:14,657
and make repairs and that sort of thing.

394
00:20:14,697 --> 00:20:18,798
So that mission is really built around that constant back and forth between the two of them.

395
00:20:21,879 --> 00:20:24,379
Which of course leads us to overall campaign and mission design.

396
00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:27,860
And when we sat down and did our sort of initial campaign design,

397
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,720
our campaign arc and narrative.

398
00:20:31,838 --> 00:20:33,819
We really went with sort of a more typical structure,

399
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,841
similar to sort of a long movie plot.

400
00:20:36,021 --> 00:20:38,644
You know, our A plot and our B plot, some twists

401
00:20:38,724 --> 00:20:41,786
and some villainous heroes and some heroic villains

402
00:20:41,806 --> 00:20:42,387
and that sort of thing.

403
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,669
And at the end of it, when we evaluated it,

404
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:46,931
I realized we had Tom Clancy's Star Trek bridge crew,

405
00:20:48,312 --> 00:20:49,293
which it was a good story,

406
00:20:49,313 --> 00:20:50,574
but obviously it was not the right story

407
00:20:50,694 --> 00:20:51,535
for what we were looking for.

408
00:20:51,995 --> 00:20:53,817
And we kind of threw that out and went back to the well.

409
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:57,058
And when we started as a narrative team talking about,

410
00:20:57,539 --> 00:20:59,622
you know, well, what is Star Trek to each of us?

411
00:20:59,862 --> 00:21:01,224
The things that kept coming up where people were like,

412
00:21:01,244 --> 00:21:03,106
ah, well, there's this one episode where blah, blah, blah,

413
00:21:03,126 --> 00:21:06,030
blah, blah, or that one episode when hmm, you know, happened.

414
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:09,592
And it kept coming back to that sort of,

415
00:21:10,292 --> 00:21:11,593
that episodic approach, right?

416
00:21:12,334 --> 00:21:13,654
Which again, you think about the franchise,

417
00:21:13,714 --> 00:21:15,695
it makes so much sense, it was rooted in television.

418
00:21:16,536 --> 00:21:19,498
So this led us to take kind of a flipped approach

419
00:21:19,718 --> 00:21:22,159
to mission design and narrative design,

420
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:26,101
which was kind of identifying these iconic

421
00:21:26,482 --> 00:21:28,383
Star Trek experiences, exploration,

422
00:21:28,443 --> 00:21:30,464
being chased by a strange entity,

423
00:21:30,904 --> 00:21:32,685
searching for enemies in a nebula, that sort of thing.

424
00:21:33,586 --> 00:21:34,486
And building these sort of,

425
00:21:35,564 --> 00:21:38,306
Missions and narratives around that core experience,

426
00:21:39,707 --> 00:21:41,247
both from a gameplay and a narrative standpoint.

427
00:21:42,148 --> 00:21:43,629
And once we kind of had figured out

428
00:21:43,949 --> 00:21:45,510
what those experiences were that we wanted,

429
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,091
then we went and arranged them in a way

430
00:21:47,371 --> 00:21:50,393
that gave us a nice sort of long-term narrative arc

431
00:21:50,513 --> 00:21:51,593
that felt more like a season.

432
00:21:52,874 --> 00:21:54,675
And we really had to be comfortable with the idea

433
00:21:54,715 --> 00:21:56,596
that not every mission had to have

434
00:21:56,736 --> 00:21:57,957
every Star Trek thing in it.

435
00:21:58,997 --> 00:22:00,899
And we really wanted to focus on sort of each,

436
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,621
each mission having a distinctive feeling.

437
00:22:05,389 --> 00:22:13,532
And recognizing that we had to be comfortable with the idea that players were going to argue about which was the best mission based on kind of what they wanted their personal Star Trek experience to be.

438
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:19,855
From a mission framework standpoint, we kind of settled on this three-point thing of a concern, a complication, a crisis.

439
00:22:20,556 --> 00:22:24,758
And that just means that we had kind of an initial setup for why you are where you are.

440
00:22:25,398 --> 00:22:26,799
Sometimes it's something benign.

441
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:27,719
Oh, we're exploring this.

442
00:22:28,326 --> 00:22:31,368
area or sometimes it's, oh, we're trying to help this ship in distress.

443
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:37,492
Inevitably, there's more to it than you first imagined, and usually that leads to some sort

444
00:22:37,652 --> 00:22:39,993
of decision point for the captain.

445
00:22:41,051 --> 00:22:42,933
So it wasn't really a formula that we followed

446
00:22:42,953 --> 00:22:44,054
so much as one that we played with.

447
00:22:44,194 --> 00:22:47,056
We kind of settled on this as feeling like Star Trek to us.

448
00:22:47,637 --> 00:22:49,258
And then we kind of adjusted those weights.

449
00:22:49,698 --> 00:22:50,739
But that was very helpful for us.

450
00:22:53,221 --> 00:22:54,823
Obviously trying to define what makes Star Trek,

451
00:22:54,863 --> 00:22:56,884
Star Trek is a bad idea because it's so many things

452
00:22:56,924 --> 00:22:57,785
to so many different people.

453
00:22:58,906 --> 00:23:01,388
But for us, one of the core ideas that we latched onto

454
00:23:01,568 --> 00:23:03,130
was this idea of an interaction of experts.

455
00:23:04,171 --> 00:23:06,172
So sort of the crew is the heart of every solution.

456
00:23:07,073 --> 00:23:12,697
And again, giving each player an opportunity to shine at some point in the mission and over the campaign.

457
00:23:14,078 --> 00:23:15,739
So we identified some iconic roles.

458
00:23:15,899 --> 00:23:19,822
So we had our captain, our helm, our engineer, obviously,

459
00:23:19,862 --> 00:23:22,804
but also communications, science officer, medical, you know,

460
00:23:22,884 --> 00:23:25,986
any of those people that you've seen from across various properties.

461
00:23:27,107 --> 00:23:29,109
And we selected the most that were compelling for gameplay.

462
00:23:30,221 --> 00:23:34,385
which sometimes required us to collapse or combine roles.

463
00:23:35,066 --> 00:23:37,288
This is one of the reasons that working with CBS was so great.

464
00:23:37,328 --> 00:23:40,851
When we designed the ship that we made, it's smaller than the Enterprise.

465
00:23:41,031 --> 00:23:42,933
It's not a flagship, obviously.

466
00:23:42,953 --> 00:23:44,594
It's a smaller, different role.

467
00:23:45,876 --> 00:23:47,978
And so we were able to kind of work with them to figure out

468
00:23:48,498 --> 00:23:52,201
where it would make sense to combine roles that we see on the shows.

469
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:58,360
And then, for example, a tactical officer handles scanning, for example, which, you know,

470
00:23:58,401 --> 00:24:01,428
typically we think of as more of a science officer role, but it made sense for us to do that.

471
00:24:03,417 --> 00:24:08,159
And really it was important for us to make sure that players

472
00:24:08,179 --> 00:24:10,159
who had never seen an episode of the show could still feel

473
00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:11,560
like they were expert at their role.

474
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:16,422
So that helped, had to work a lot with making sure

475
00:24:16,442 --> 00:24:18,042
that the stations were very learnable,

476
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:20,643
that each of the actions themselves were fairly

477
00:24:20,683 --> 00:24:21,284
straightforward.

478
00:24:22,184 --> 00:24:26,205
And then we got a lot of the sort of expertise

479
00:24:26,225 --> 00:24:29,207
that we were looking for out of the combination of actions

480
00:24:29,327 --> 00:24:30,847
or the coordination of actions with other people.

481
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:35,217
All of which required us to develop kind of a shared vocabulary.

482
00:24:36,538 --> 00:24:39,379
So a major part of the Star Trek franchise, obviously,

483
00:24:39,439 --> 00:24:41,720
is in its sort of particular use of language.

484
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,421
So helping people communicate authentically was something

485
00:24:45,441 --> 00:24:50,624
that we really had to tackle, which was a challenge for us.

486
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,765
So there's sort of this feeling about Star Trek that, you know,

487
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:55,886
that sounds like science.

488
00:24:55,926 --> 00:24:59,287
There's so much jargon and technical jargon that sounds...

489
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:00,810
plausible.

490
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,970
And we went through a lot of transcripts.

491
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,211
And I don't know if anybody's familiar with the Memory Alpha

492
00:25:06,231 --> 00:25:06,671
website.

493
00:25:06,711 --> 00:25:10,452
We use that quite a bit to try and capture that language

494
00:25:10,492 --> 00:25:11,072
that we were after.

495
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:13,692
And we recognized that players are contributing

496
00:25:13,732 --> 00:25:14,952
to each other's experiences.

497
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:20,353
So again, we had to make sure that new players could

498
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:21,934
sound expert, could use that language,

499
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:25,074
even when they weren't familiar with it from the shows.

500
00:25:25,935 --> 00:25:27,895
So a lot of what we did was build the language

501
00:25:27,915 --> 00:25:29,975
that we wanted people to use directly into the UI.

502
00:25:31,792 --> 00:25:34,093
So phasers, detection range, shield level, that sort of thing.

503
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:35,493
It's people reporting on things.

504
00:25:35,513 --> 00:25:37,254
It sounds like what you'd hear on the shows.

505
00:25:38,775 --> 00:25:44,417
And for example, our warp core process is actually going to warp requires helm

506
00:25:44,457 --> 00:25:47,238
and engineer to work together to go through these sort of protocol.

507
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:52,720
And what we found is after a couple of play throughs, people start to develop this cadence

508
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,281
and pattern as a crew of when they're hitting their marks.

509
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:56,701
Okay, I'm ready, I'm ready, this is ready.

510
00:25:56,861 --> 00:25:57,401
Okay, hit it.

511
00:25:58,482 --> 00:26:01,104
And that was really encouraging to us that we were kind of hitting our marks

512
00:26:01,124 --> 00:26:02,085
with what we were going for there.

513
00:26:03,046 --> 00:26:06,569
And again, that coordination of the team as to the authenticity

514
00:26:06,589 --> 00:26:08,671
that we're looking for for the entire environment, right?

515
00:26:08,691 --> 00:26:10,813
You start to feel like a crew because it sounds like a crew.

516
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:11,934
So that was great.

517
00:26:13,295 --> 00:26:15,496
Sorry, I'm trying to blast through these because I know we got a late start, so.

518
00:26:16,334 --> 00:26:19,775
Finally, filling out the bridge, obviously it's not enough just to have four people running

519
00:26:19,795 --> 00:26:22,195
around, running a starship.

520
00:26:22,315 --> 00:26:28,357
So to kind of fill out the rest of the crew, make sure this advances.

521
00:26:30,857 --> 00:26:32,097
Ready, go ahead.

522
00:26:32,778 --> 00:26:33,918
Sorry, I have a shot here.

523
00:26:36,238 --> 00:26:37,179
Did we just lock up?

524
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:38,919
My slides aren't advancing.

525
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,160
There we go.

526
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:42,460
All right.

527
00:26:43,355 --> 00:26:46,097
So, as I said, you can't play this solo,

528
00:26:46,197 --> 00:26:47,458
so anytime you've got a partial crew,

529
00:26:47,478 --> 00:26:49,300
if you don't have humans at one of the,

530
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,981
either helm, tactical, or engineer,

531
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:54,724
it'll be taken over by what we internally called a crew bot.

532
00:26:55,825 --> 00:26:56,806
And from a writing standpoint,

533
00:26:57,226 --> 00:26:59,007
we wrote the VO for crew bots.

534
00:27:00,446 --> 00:27:02,328
Really in a way that we hoped would instruct players

535
00:27:02,408 --> 00:27:04,369
on how they should communicate when they are in that role.

536
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:08,353
So a tactical officer only ever reports on tactical things

537
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:09,794
like when a new enemy appears.

538
00:27:11,075 --> 00:27:12,717
Engineers reporting on things like subsystem health.

539
00:27:13,478 --> 00:27:15,880
And we're really using those as a way

540
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,901
so that when players don't have a human there,

541
00:27:18,442 --> 00:27:19,723
they're learning what it should,

542
00:27:20,143 --> 00:27:22,205
when they play in that role, they should be reporting on.

543
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:27,867
Secondly, we had info shirts, which were our communications officer, who's back here,

544
00:27:28,067 --> 00:27:30,508
and our camera-shy science officer.

545
00:27:31,548 --> 00:27:33,068
We put them in because they were iconic roles.

546
00:27:33,628 --> 00:27:37,649
We just couldn't find enough gameplay to support human players for that.

547
00:27:37,749 --> 00:27:42,331
So what we did was we made them critical for narrative information and for gameplay information

548
00:27:42,951 --> 00:27:45,451
and used them kind of to replace the talking head.

549
00:27:45,611 --> 00:27:48,272
So now you've got somebody on the crew who's giving you this information

550
00:27:48,372 --> 00:27:51,413
in a way that felt natural to the franchise.

551
00:27:52,215 --> 00:27:54,076
And then finally we have these guys over here,

552
00:27:55,356 --> 00:27:57,836
our red shirts, and they're actually all around

553
00:27:57,856 --> 00:27:59,677
the outer ring of the bridge.

554
00:28:00,177 --> 00:28:02,017
And this is really where we packed in a lot of that

555
00:28:02,137 --> 00:28:03,417
technical and scientific jargon.

556
00:28:03,818 --> 00:28:05,538
These are the guys that when everything's normal,

557
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:08,638
they're reporting on how Jeffrey 2.14 is,

558
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:11,599
and when things are bad that there's fire

559
00:28:11,659 --> 00:28:12,579
on deck six or whatever.

560
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:14,620
So none of this is critical information,

561
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,100
but it does give you general game state information,

562
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,000
and that was really where we were able to kind of

563
00:28:19,501 --> 00:28:21,001
pack in that jargon that we were looking for.

564
00:28:22,222 --> 00:28:23,062
How are we doing for time?

565
00:28:23,082 --> 00:28:23,663
Are we out?

566
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:24,623
Do people?

567
00:28:25,104 --> 00:28:25,964
We're pretty much out.

568
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:27,545
All right, let me just go over the drama.

569
00:28:27,905 --> 00:28:32,448
Turns out, interpersonal drama happens pretty naturally.

570
00:28:32,468 --> 00:28:36,050
So if you take a skilled crew and you apply a little pressure

571
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:36,290
to them.

572
00:28:37,025 --> 00:28:40,466
You start ending up with things like this where everybody is calling for things.

573
00:28:41,046 --> 00:28:43,847
And, you know, anyway.

574
00:28:44,167 --> 00:28:49,229
So we had to be very careful about, we found that we needed to be careful

575
00:28:49,249 --> 00:28:51,190
about how much narrative information we were trying to push

576
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:54,491
because sometimes you get these high interaction moments between crew

577
00:28:54,991 --> 00:28:57,792
and there wasn't any room for us to give more information into that.

578
00:28:57,892 --> 00:28:58,873
So we had to balance that stuff out.

579
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:03,989
So we've come a very long way, all the way from here to now here.

580
00:29:05,771 --> 00:29:09,155
I would say that, you know, this is sort of the known area of video games.

581
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:14,201
We on the Star Trek Bridge Crew team have very boldly gone forward into the future,

582
00:29:14,261 --> 00:29:16,244
probably maybe roughly about here.

583
00:29:17,845 --> 00:29:23,009
Which is to say, we really have no idea what's out there for VR.

584
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:26,932
And that's not to say anything about, you know, all these other places,

585
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:28,433
some of which aren't even on the map.

586
00:29:29,053 --> 00:29:31,815
So, I'm really excited about a lot of the tools and techniques

587
00:29:31,835 --> 00:29:34,858
that we're going to be discovering in VR.

588
00:29:35,198 --> 00:29:37,940
I think we're just really, just now getting started on figuring

589
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,581
out some of the techniques for exploring this stuff.

590
00:29:40,081 --> 00:29:40,682
And that is time.

591
00:29:41,102 --> 00:29:41,923
And thank you all so much.

592
00:29:42,043 --> 00:29:42,543
Appreciate it.

593
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,839
Contact information, hit me up on Twitter.

594
00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:49,326
I'll take questions out there.
