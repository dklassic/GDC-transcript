00:00:05,924 --> 00:00:12,528
Hello everyone, and welcome to rewarding explorations with collectibles and gatherables.

2
00:00:12,528 --> 00:00:17,232
My name is Leah Miller, and let me tell you a little bit more about myself.

3
00:00:18,212 --> 00:00:20,452
I've made a lot of MMOs.

4
00:00:20,452 --> 00:00:25,754
I worked on Dark Age of Camelot, which was one of the first-gen 3D MMOs.

5
00:00:25,754 --> 00:00:29,795
I worked on its spiritual successor, Warhammer Online, and I worked on Wildstar.

6
00:00:29,795 --> 00:00:37,017
I've also done a bunch of research in this space on things like how location and population

7
00:00:37,017 --> 00:00:43,039
density affects gameplay in Pokemon Go, how gatherable density affects gameplay in PUBG,

8
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:44,140
that kind of thing.

9
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,164
I'm super interested in this subject. It's always been one of my favorite parts of game design.

10
00:00:49,164 --> 00:00:51,346
I've always wondered why people don't talk about it more.

11
00:00:53,418 --> 00:00:56,900
I had a formative experience when I was playing,

12
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,743
wandering through this gorgeous woods in 2002.

13
00:01:01,743 --> 00:01:03,905
Look at the top of the line graphics there.

14
00:01:03,905 --> 00:01:08,148
And as I was wandering along, I saw this cool construct thing

15
00:01:08,148 --> 00:01:09,609
wandering around.

16
00:01:09,609 --> 00:01:12,010
I'd never seen a monster like this before.

17
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,252
As I went deeper in, there was a bigger, scarier, more

18
00:01:15,252 --> 00:01:15,873
impressive one.

19
00:01:15,873 --> 00:01:18,074
Again, unlike anything else I'd seen in the area.

20
00:01:19,075 --> 00:01:25,280
Eventually, I came upon a tower that was so mysterious that I can't find screenshots of it anymore.

21
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,241
This was from 15 years ago.

22
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:29,003
But it was gorgeous.

23
00:01:29,003 --> 00:01:34,347
And when I went inside, there was like obviously this factory where these constructs had been made.

24
00:01:34,347 --> 00:01:36,248
And there was a secret tower.

25
00:01:36,248 --> 00:01:38,390
And I went up to the top of the tower.

26
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:43,313
And there was this mysterious bedroom that it looked like someone had been living in really recently.

27
00:01:43,313 --> 00:01:46,576
And in that bedroom, there was nothing.

28
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:50,642
absolutely nothing to indicate what this place was,

29
00:01:50,642 --> 00:01:51,763
what had happened there,

30
00:01:51,763 --> 00:01:54,083
what kind of content took place there.

31
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:56,564
I would never find out, and I worked there.

32
00:01:56,564 --> 00:02:00,046
I asked my coworkers, and they said,

33
00:02:00,046 --> 00:02:00,186
oh,

34
00:02:01,227 --> 00:02:03,868
one of those quests, but the quests in the area

35
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:06,429
were sort of not highly relevant anymore.

36
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:07,929
People weren't doing them.

37
00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:11,551
And so this gorgeous space that had been created

38
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:13,512
and that had been really fun to explore

39
00:02:13,512 --> 00:02:15,152
had no payoff, had no reward.

40
00:02:15,152 --> 00:02:17,874
And while it's a good memory for me,

41
00:02:17,874 --> 00:02:19,754
I can find screenshots of these monsters

42
00:02:19,754 --> 00:02:24,616
because they're relevant to content that's frequently done.

43
00:02:24,616 --> 00:02:27,758
I can't find any screenshots of that super cool tower.

44
00:02:30,057 --> 00:02:31,618
Breath of the Wild is the opposite of this.

45
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:34,500
In Breath of the Wild, if you see something cool,

46
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,362
there's almost always something there.

47
00:02:38,362 --> 00:02:41,245
It teaches you as you play a visual language

48
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:43,606
that suggests the presence of something.

49
00:02:43,606 --> 00:02:46,488
If you're wandering along really early,

50
00:02:46,488 --> 00:02:48,330
you'll see a rock that looks out of place

51
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,671
lifted up, one of your first Korok seeds.

52
00:02:51,309 --> 00:02:54,272
It teaches you to notice patterns.

53
00:02:54,272 --> 00:02:56,034
It teaches you to look for things.

54
00:02:56,034 --> 00:02:59,458
It teaches you that exploration is always valuable.

55
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:02,521
And then later on, it gives you tools like Treasure Radar

56
00:03:02,521 --> 00:03:06,085
and other systems to allow you to sort of shape

57
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:09,008
your own exploration and choose your own goals

58
00:03:09,008 --> 00:03:11,010
and outline your own motives.

59
00:03:12,856 --> 00:03:16,077
I've developed some terms for discussing this.

60
00:03:16,077 --> 00:03:19,357
Collectibles are finite number and set in locations.

61
00:03:19,357 --> 00:03:21,438
There are checklists, which are items

62
00:03:21,438 --> 00:03:25,199
where the goal is to collect them all, basically,

63
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,360
for completion's sake or to achieve a sub-goal.

64
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,461
Tomes are items that give you information about the world.

65
00:03:34,671 --> 00:03:38,314
Specific gear, which I know is the most generic label ever,

66
00:03:38,314 --> 00:03:40,976
is an item that always appears in a set place

67
00:03:40,976 --> 00:03:43,117
and there are a limited amount of them

68
00:03:43,117 --> 00:03:44,158
in the total gameplay.

69
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:48,441
Gatherables are the other side of the coin.

70
00:03:48,441 --> 00:03:52,545
They're fungible resources that are theoretically infinite.

71
00:03:52,545 --> 00:03:57,388
You'll never not be able to get more wood or more tin.

72
00:03:58,808 --> 00:04:03,771
Advancement currency is things like coins or bonus XP,

73
00:04:03,771 --> 00:04:07,174
things that collecting them allows you to either

74
00:04:07,174 --> 00:04:10,176
buy upgrades to your gear, advance your character,

75
00:04:10,176 --> 00:04:11,337
that kind of thing.

76
00:04:11,337 --> 00:04:13,878
And then there's randomized lootables,

77
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:17,321
which are the opposite of specific gear

78
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:19,222
where you don't know for sure

79
00:04:19,222 --> 00:04:20,403
what you're going to get in them

80
00:04:20,403 --> 00:04:22,304
and their location is not fixed.

81
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,792
And the three tree Korok puzzles in Zelda

82
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:32,135
are a perfect example of these working together.

83
00:04:32,135 --> 00:04:35,618
You're trained early on to see the bright red apples,

84
00:04:35,618 --> 00:04:37,639
to know that they're a resource.

85
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,881
And then you see this visual language

86
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:42,643
that you'll eventually learn is showing you a puzzle

87
00:04:42,643 --> 00:04:45,205
that will result in a Korok seed, which is a collectible,

88
00:04:45,205 --> 00:04:46,906
where there's a limited amount

89
00:04:46,906 --> 00:04:48,627
and you're trying to either reach a goal

90
00:04:48,627 --> 00:04:50,689
in how many you've collected or collect them all.

91
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:56,558
This basically rewards exploration, draws the player's eye,

92
00:04:56,558 --> 00:04:58,341
and teaches them about the world.

93
00:04:58,341 --> 00:05:03,769
The opposite of this is this beautiful photo

94
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:05,371
that I took while playing Pokemon Go.

95
00:05:06,647 --> 00:05:08,068
In the first iteration of Pokemon Go,

96
00:05:08,068 --> 00:05:10,409
going to a gym and keeping your Pokemon there

97
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:12,970
for a long time was actually really valuable.

98
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:16,872
So if you could find a gym that was in the middle of a park,

99
00:05:16,872 --> 00:05:21,374
like, I would go out and hike there every two or three weeks

100
00:05:21,374 --> 00:05:24,295
and leave my Pokemon in this gorgeous place.

101
00:05:24,295 --> 00:05:26,396
The gym was called the Abandoned Mill,

102
00:05:26,396 --> 00:05:27,717
which is, how cool is that?

103
00:05:29,178 --> 00:05:31,840
Ever since they changed their gameplay

104
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,321
so that turnover is more important than longevity,

105
00:05:34,321 --> 00:05:36,161
now you only get coins from Pokemon

106
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:38,222
not every day if they're there,

107
00:05:38,222 --> 00:05:40,243
but from when the gym turns over.

108
00:05:40,243 --> 00:05:42,884
This means that the more remote places

109
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,425
are actually less good as targets now

110
00:05:45,425 --> 00:05:48,406
and have been heavily disincentivized.

111
00:05:48,406 --> 00:05:50,767
You've gotta be careful when you make these changes

112
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:55,229
to your economy because economy will motivate behavior.

113
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,250
I used to make this hike.

114
00:05:57,616 --> 00:05:59,839
every month, sometimes more often,

115
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,881
and I honestly haven't been back

116
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:06,406
since they changed the system.

117
00:06:06,406 --> 00:06:07,267
Everything is the economy.

118
00:06:08,173 --> 00:06:10,234
Every balance you make and where items are found,

119
00:06:10,234 --> 00:06:13,135
every balance you make and where content is found

120
00:06:13,135 --> 00:06:15,035
will weigh on players' decisions,

121
00:06:15,035 --> 00:06:17,216
and they will always weigh it as if everything

122
00:06:17,216 --> 00:06:19,016
were a currency.

123
00:06:19,016 --> 00:06:21,797
Is plot advancement is a currency?

124
00:06:21,797 --> 00:06:23,057
Leveling is a currency.

125
00:06:23,057 --> 00:06:24,857
Exploration is a currency.

126
00:06:24,857 --> 00:06:27,238
Players will often do what is efficient

127
00:06:27,238 --> 00:06:28,958
rather than doing what they consider fun.

128
00:06:33,317 --> 00:06:36,800
They'll also there's also a stigma sometimes against

129
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,484
focusing too much on the kind of gameplay that is suboptimal

130
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,085
for a particular game.

131
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:45,488
If somebody is wandering around exploring they're seen as less

132
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,291
serious of a player if it's a game with competitive aspects.

133
00:06:51,214 --> 00:06:53,976
Wildstar actually had a big problem with this at launch.

134
00:06:53,976 --> 00:06:57,138
We wanted to set up a Plex-like system.

135
00:06:57,138 --> 00:07:01,061
Plex is EVE Online's pay-to-subscribe model

136
00:07:01,061 --> 00:07:03,763
where players can buy subscriptions,

137
00:07:03,763 --> 00:07:05,925
put them on the auction house, and then other players can

138
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,846
buy them for in-game currency.

139
00:07:07,846 --> 00:07:10,968
It works really well if players have a reason

140
00:07:10,968 --> 00:07:12,869
to want to get in-game currency.

141
00:07:13,965 --> 00:07:17,267
Wildstar's economy was rebalanced shortly before launch,

142
00:07:17,267 --> 00:07:19,629
and it removed multiple gold sinks,

143
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:21,911
which meant that farming for gold

144
00:07:21,911 --> 00:07:24,594
was no longer an efficient enterprise.

145
00:07:24,594 --> 00:07:26,315
It was no longer a core part

146
00:07:26,315 --> 00:07:28,557
of what players were doing in game.

147
00:07:28,557 --> 00:07:31,459
Because of that, several relevant systems

148
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:33,641
became less relevant for players,

149
00:07:33,641 --> 00:07:37,204
and the cred system wasn't as strongly utilized

150
00:07:37,204 --> 00:07:38,045
as we had hoped.

151
00:07:40,868 --> 00:07:44,190
At the same time, people still like gathering.

152
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:49,994
There's this really cool kind of love

153
00:07:49,994 --> 00:07:53,897
of the mix between gathering and more intense play.

154
00:07:53,897 --> 00:07:55,638
While there are plenty of total chill games,

155
00:07:55,638 --> 00:07:59,321
a lot of people will spend hours and hours

156
00:07:59,321 --> 00:08:01,422
working on something in Minecraft

157
00:08:01,422 --> 00:08:03,063
or wandering around Monster Hunter

158
00:08:03,063 --> 00:08:05,665
and still like the punctuation of combat,

159
00:08:05,665 --> 00:08:08,547
even when most of the gameplay is gathering-centric.

160
00:08:08,607 --> 00:08:10,889
The balance between these is really important.

161
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:13,631
And I don't think it's something we highlight as much

162
00:08:13,631 --> 00:08:15,273
because players will often not say,

163
00:08:15,273 --> 00:08:19,396
oh man, I'm looking for a game with really good gathering.

164
00:08:19,396 --> 00:08:21,919
But when they're given one, they'll really enjoy it.

165
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,723
So I want to distinguish that last tweet

166
00:08:26,723 --> 00:08:28,764
had a good example of the interplay

167
00:08:28,764 --> 00:08:30,646
between collecting and gathering versus grinding.

168
00:08:30,646 --> 00:08:33,669
For me, collecting and gathering is

169
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:35,750
interacting with static objects or entities

170
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,371
placed in the world.

171
00:08:37,743 --> 00:08:40,783
Action may be involved but it usually doesn't imply violence

172
00:08:40,783 --> 00:08:44,524
and rare monster spawning can leverage similar principles.

173
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,184
If you're putting in rare monsters

174
00:08:46,184 --> 00:08:47,925
where the combat is not the point,

175
00:08:47,925 --> 00:08:51,145
you can still apply a lot of these design principles

176
00:08:51,145 --> 00:08:54,766
because it's really just finding an object to interact with

177
00:08:54,766 --> 00:08:56,866
only in that case you're interacting

178
00:08:56,866 --> 00:08:59,007
with your sword or whatever.

179
00:08:59,007 --> 00:09:00,807
I'm still gonna stick primarily

180
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:03,308
to object-based gatherables here

181
00:09:03,308 --> 00:09:05,268
but I just wanted to let you know

182
00:09:05,268 --> 00:09:06,988
in the increased applications.

183
00:09:08,807 --> 00:09:09,807
But why?

184
00:09:09,807 --> 00:09:11,369
Why do people like gathering?

185
00:09:11,369 --> 00:09:13,450
Why do people like this?

186
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,691
There's a bunch of reasons.

187
00:09:14,691 --> 00:09:17,773
One is that it provides a way to socialize.

188
00:09:17,773 --> 00:09:21,136
A friend of mine used to do data gathering

189
00:09:21,136 --> 00:09:22,937
based on WoW add-ons.

190
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:26,740
And he found that people spent a huge amount of time

191
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,481
doing mining and herbalism in WoW.

192
00:09:29,172 --> 00:09:32,272
He also had another one add-on that saved chat logs

193
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:34,533
and found out that people were really likely

194
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:39,795
to combine herbalism and mining with chatting activities,

195
00:09:39,795 --> 00:09:40,735
with their social time.

196
00:09:40,735 --> 00:09:45,756
And people who used their social time for gathering

197
00:09:45,756 --> 00:09:48,357
were actually more likely to continue playing

198
00:09:48,357 --> 00:09:51,298
than people who spent their social time

199
00:09:51,298 --> 00:09:53,418
dancing in the storm wind fountain

200
00:09:53,418 --> 00:09:57,259
or any of the other non-productive ways

201
00:09:57,259 --> 00:09:58,060
to engage with that.

202
00:10:02,876 --> 00:10:06,440
So this is my big point.

203
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,606
Gatherables and collectibles are more interconnected

204
00:10:12,606 --> 00:10:15,670
than any other aspect of game design.

205
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,513
Other things may be the focus, and these are really,

206
00:10:18,513 --> 00:10:20,775
a lot of the times, the connective tissue in your game.

207
00:10:20,775 --> 00:10:24,059
You have to be aware of a lot of things

208
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:25,040
when doing this placement.

209
00:10:25,801 --> 00:10:28,321
you have to be aware of combat in the area,

210
00:10:28,321 --> 00:10:30,882
story and characters relevant to the space,

211
00:10:30,882 --> 00:10:32,302
what the world in prop art is

212
00:10:32,302 --> 00:10:34,123
so that your things look appropriate

213
00:10:34,123 --> 00:10:35,463
and so that you're teaching players

214
00:10:35,463 --> 00:10:37,583
the rules of where to find things

215
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:40,084
and the economic and symbolic weight

216
00:10:40,084 --> 00:10:42,204
of the items that you're placing.

217
00:10:42,204 --> 00:10:46,525
And I wanna talk about how different principles of design

218
00:10:46,525 --> 00:10:49,245
apply to the different types

219
00:10:49,245 --> 00:10:52,526
of collectibles and gatherables.

220
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,547
My favorite type of collectible and gatherable is the tome.

221
00:10:56,675 --> 00:11:02,142
This is basically holocrons, recorders in Bioshock,

222
00:11:02,142 --> 00:11:06,047
journal entries, those little hits of narrative and lore.

223
00:11:06,047 --> 00:11:09,712
For this one, you'll be collaborating a lot with narrative,

224
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:12,075
but you'll also be collaborating a lot with art

225
00:11:12,075 --> 00:11:13,397
and world art and props.

226
00:11:14,346 --> 00:11:16,548
you can actually add a lot to the story

227
00:11:16,548 --> 00:11:19,231
and save the narrative designer some work

228
00:11:19,231 --> 00:11:22,374
by strategic placement of lore items.

229
00:11:22,374 --> 00:11:24,656
If a letter from a random scientist

230
00:11:24,656 --> 00:11:27,599
is just scattered on the floor, whatever,

231
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:30,421
but what if it's in the desk of a rival scientist?

232
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:34,525
That adds a layer to the story that would not be there

233
00:11:34,525 --> 00:11:37,528
by just placing an item in a slightly more strategic place.

234
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,701
The big thing to be careful with about these though

235
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,162
is not to halt flow.

236
00:11:43,162 --> 00:11:44,822
One of the biggest design no-no's

237
00:11:44,822 --> 00:11:46,923
if you're going to have narrative gatherables

238
00:11:46,923 --> 00:11:49,204
is to force the player to stop and read

239
00:11:49,204 --> 00:11:50,244
or listen to it right then.

240
00:11:50,244 --> 00:11:53,805
You can have it follow them.

241
00:11:53,805 --> 00:11:56,486
There's an option that very few places have done

242
00:11:56,486 --> 00:11:57,986
but that I'm in favor of which is

243
00:11:57,986 --> 00:12:00,907
adding audio gatherables to a queue

244
00:12:00,907 --> 00:12:03,888
that you can then decide to play yourself during downtime.

245
00:12:03,888 --> 00:12:07,649
The next major type, oh sorry.

246
00:12:09,548 --> 00:12:12,489
The next major type I wanna talk about is checklists.

247
00:12:12,489 --> 00:12:16,910
Checklists covers a really wide array

248
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,771
of different implementations.

249
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:22,472
It's basically anything where collecting them all

250
00:12:22,472 --> 00:12:26,073
is the vital part, like the letters in Donkey Kong

251
00:12:26,073 --> 00:12:29,334
or secrets like the orbs in Inside.

252
00:12:29,334 --> 00:12:31,214
I don't know if you guys have played Inside,

253
00:12:31,214 --> 00:12:33,675
but it's this cool platformer and in it,

254
00:12:33,675 --> 00:12:36,536
there are a few orbs you'll probably run into like,

255
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:40,476
three of them if you play the game normally,

256
00:12:40,476 --> 00:12:42,097
but then you can play through multiple times,

257
00:12:42,097 --> 00:12:44,517
explore everywhere, and find them all,

258
00:12:44,517 --> 00:12:47,838
which leads to a secret ending.

259
00:12:47,838 --> 00:12:49,299
Quest items and checklists share a lot,

260
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:52,760
and I don't always like to group them in the same thing,

261
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,221
but it's important to draw that comparison

262
00:12:56,221 --> 00:12:58,642
because if you find a quest isn't working,

263
00:12:58,642 --> 00:12:59,882
that it's not satisfying,

264
00:12:59,882 --> 00:13:02,183
or the story related to it isn't capturing people,

265
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:06,466
you can convert it into a gatherable

266
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:10,691
that rewards something less significant and less important,

267
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:15,576
like an achievement or an optional item or a cosmetic.

268
00:13:15,576 --> 00:13:19,079
You can draw focus away from it from making it ambient

269
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:22,122
instead of the kind of necessity

270
00:13:22,122 --> 00:13:24,945
that implementing it as a quest gives it.

271
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:29,025
The next type of collectible I want to talk about

272
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:32,667
is specific gear, which again, very generic term,

273
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:36,790
but it's when items are placed in a set place

274
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,471
and you know where you're going to get them,

275
00:13:38,471 --> 00:13:40,672
you're going to get them in the same place

276
00:13:40,672 --> 00:13:42,553
in every type of playthrough,

277
00:13:42,553 --> 00:13:44,575
and there's a limited amount of them.

278
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:48,737
It can be a piece of equipment, a decorative item,

279
00:13:48,737 --> 00:13:51,319
or even just like a jokey fluff souvenir.

280
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,100
If you run enough MMOs, you'll be amazed at what people keep.

281
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,843
I know people who have had vendor trash items from Vanilla

282
00:13:58,843 --> 00:14:03,366
WoW in their banks since whenever Vanilla WoW launched.

283
00:14:03,366 --> 00:14:08,029
What is time?

284
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:10,831
Chests in old school Final Fantasy games

285
00:14:10,831 --> 00:14:13,452
are this type of collectible.

286
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,854
Metrovanias, RPGs, and games with RPG elements

287
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:18,956
are the ones that are most likely to design gear

288
00:14:18,956 --> 00:14:20,837
acquisition around stuff like this.

289
00:14:22,843 --> 00:14:26,586
Now I want to move from collectibles to gatherables.

290
00:14:26,586 --> 00:14:30,368
The most common gatherable type is crafting materials.

291
00:14:30,368 --> 00:14:33,971
Like, literally everything in Minecraft is a gatherable.

292
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:38,034
Herbalism and mining nodes are the most common type

293
00:14:38,034 --> 00:14:39,215
in other genres.

294
00:14:39,215 --> 00:14:42,737
The best way to implement this is

295
00:14:42,737 --> 00:14:44,718
to use it as a way to teach players rules

296
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:45,919
and make them feel smart.

297
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:49,362
There's the rule that you have to dig to a certain depth

298
00:14:49,362 --> 00:14:50,362
to get diamonds.

299
00:14:51,042 --> 00:14:56,885
In other games, there are certain props around which certain other gatherables are likely to spawn.

300
00:14:56,885 --> 00:15:03,408
Like in Wildstar, we had these cool owl statues and we had specific herbs and specific mining nodes

301
00:15:03,408 --> 00:15:06,389
that would be more likely to be found around the owl statues.

302
00:15:12,227 --> 00:15:15,128
This is the most sort of obscure gatherable type

303
00:15:15,128 --> 00:15:18,010
that people often don't think of as a gatherable.

304
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,891
They think of it as its own thing.

305
00:15:19,891 --> 00:15:23,734
Advancement currency can be gold, experience,

306
00:15:23,734 --> 00:15:26,315
anything that you basically gather a lot of,

307
00:15:26,315 --> 00:15:28,817
like a near infinite supply,

308
00:15:28,817 --> 00:15:30,378
and use to advance your character.

309
00:15:30,378 --> 00:15:31,859
As you can see here,

310
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:35,401
These are advancement currency trails.

311
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,762
There are two gold trails on the bottom

312
00:15:37,762 --> 00:15:39,543
and then hovering sort of in the middle

313
00:15:39,543 --> 00:15:41,444
is a circle of XP nodes.

314
00:15:41,444 --> 00:15:44,706
This lets the player know that both of those trails

315
00:15:44,706 --> 00:15:46,367
are an option for where they can go

316
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:49,649
in this sort of fast-paced downhill slide event.

317
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:52,691
And also that there's a bonus for making a jump.

318
00:15:53,172 --> 00:15:55,613
It teaches players mechanics, it shows them paths,

319
00:15:55,613 --> 00:15:57,935
and it does it with a resource

320
00:15:57,935 --> 00:15:59,736
that will pay off for them later.

321
00:15:59,736 --> 00:16:02,538
This is one of the types of gatherals

322
00:16:02,538 --> 00:16:05,299
people are most familiar with and most often encounter,

323
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:08,241
since even the old Mario games would often

324
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:11,443
show you hidden or alternate paths with coin trails.

325
00:16:14,911 --> 00:16:16,633
And the final category of gatherables

326
00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:20,117
I'm going to talk about right now is randomized lootables.

327
00:16:20,117 --> 00:16:24,503
This used to primarily be in the form of treasure chests,

328
00:16:24,503 --> 00:16:28,868
but PUBG and Fortnite have sort of revolutionized this variety

329
00:16:28,868 --> 00:16:32,272
by skipping the middlemen and just putting them

330
00:16:32,272 --> 00:16:33,514
right out there.

331
00:16:33,514 --> 00:16:34,935
And this actually provides

332
00:16:35,963 --> 00:16:40,105
a way to reward observation, a way to reward visual knowledge,

333
00:16:40,105 --> 00:16:42,206
which is something we don't often see rewarded

334
00:16:42,206 --> 00:16:43,106
in this kind of game.

335
00:16:43,106 --> 00:16:46,808
It's also ways to give players an instant dopamine hit.

336
00:16:46,808 --> 00:16:49,209
They don't have to open the chest in order

337
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:51,690
to see what's available.

338
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:54,911
They can walk into a room and see that, as in this picture,

339
00:16:54,911 --> 00:16:57,432
there's a Kar98 with a scope right next to it.

340
00:16:57,432 --> 00:17:01,013
Even if the player doesn't win, that's

341
00:17:01,013 --> 00:17:03,874
a huge victory dopamine hit you give them

342
00:17:03,874 --> 00:17:04,515
early on in.

343
00:17:04,955 --> 00:17:06,076
to keep their process.

344
00:17:06,076 --> 00:17:11,160
I wanna talk about when collectibles and gatherables fail.

345
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:18,026
A lot of people find collectibles and gatherables tedious.

346
00:17:18,026 --> 00:17:21,990
They feel like completing them is too grueling.

347
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,851
And if they're completionists,

348
00:17:23,851 --> 00:17:25,593
they feel like they have to 100% a game.

349
00:17:25,593 --> 00:17:28,155
And if you go too far with gatherables,

350
00:17:28,155 --> 00:17:29,536
then they get frustrated.

351
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:36,434
There's also the famous problem when gatherables are incongruous, when somebody's wandering

352
00:17:36,434 --> 00:17:42,679
through a high-tech place and like half of the gatherables are magic orbs.

353
00:17:45,488 --> 00:17:49,793
You can try to be clever and end up being antagonistic.

354
00:17:49,793 --> 00:17:51,854
If somebody has a collection quest

355
00:17:51,854 --> 00:17:55,498
and every single other collection quest item

356
00:17:55,498 --> 00:17:57,159
has been on a floor or on a bookshelf

357
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,141
and you hide one in the ceiling

358
00:17:59,141 --> 00:18:01,624
and that makes the player finish this level

359
00:18:01,624 --> 00:18:03,826
they spent a lot of time on with 99% completion,

360
00:18:03,826 --> 00:18:06,288
they'll get really frustrated.

361
00:18:06,288 --> 00:18:09,271
Unless you've taught them that that's how the game works.

362
00:18:10,328 --> 00:18:14,552
And economically unsupported is the most common problem I see.

363
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:19,176
People will put a lot of work into coming up with gatherables

364
00:18:19,176 --> 00:18:20,957
and they don't end up being useful.

365
00:18:20,957 --> 00:18:24,440
You can spend all this time on herbalism and potions suck.

366
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,224
So what constitutes a successful gatherable?

367
00:18:29,224 --> 00:18:30,585
The problem is that tastes vary.

368
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:36,021
My brother and I really enjoyed 100%ing Donkey Kong 64

369
00:18:36,021 --> 00:18:39,422
when we were kids, and a man recently tortured himself

370
00:18:39,422 --> 00:18:42,603
for charity for several days with how unpleasant

371
00:18:42,603 --> 00:18:44,784
he felt the experience was.

372
00:18:44,784 --> 00:18:48,124
So does Donkey Kong 64 have a good implementation

373
00:18:48,124 --> 00:18:49,225
of gatherables?

374
00:18:49,225 --> 00:18:50,825
It's impossible to say.

375
00:18:50,825 --> 00:18:53,166
You have to sort of tune for your audience

376
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,346
and try to get to a spot where enough people

377
00:18:55,346 --> 00:18:56,846
are having fun with your gatherables.

378
00:18:57,507 --> 00:19:00,709
and it doesn't feel as required for the people

379
00:19:00,709 --> 00:19:01,850
who aren't having as much fun.

380
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:06,673
Gatherables are also good for rewarding

381
00:19:06,673 --> 00:19:08,775
different gameplay types.

382
00:19:08,775 --> 00:19:11,677
You can motivate people towards challenge

383
00:19:11,677 --> 00:19:17,641
by hiding appealing items behind gameplay.

384
00:19:17,641 --> 00:19:21,163
You can look into your player heat maps

385
00:19:21,163 --> 00:19:26,047
and put items where there's less player play.

386
00:19:26,047 --> 00:19:26,527
And...

387
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:31,897
You can tell the story, you can teach players

388
00:19:31,897 --> 00:19:32,899
and make them feel smart.

389
00:19:32,899 --> 00:19:37,544
I wanna look at an individual zone

390
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:41,468
and talk a little bit about gatherables in shared spaces.

391
00:19:41,468 --> 00:19:45,273
First, before you're going to place things in a shared area,

392
00:19:46,263 --> 00:19:48,303
You have to know a bunch of things about that area.

393
00:19:48,303 --> 00:19:50,824
You have to know what the main route through the area is,

394
00:19:50,824 --> 00:19:52,844
where the mandatory quests are,

395
00:19:52,844 --> 00:19:55,664
where the alternate quests that will probably be popular are,

396
00:19:55,664 --> 00:19:58,425
where the safe routes are that don't have many mobs,

397
00:19:58,425 --> 00:20:03,086
what the story is, and what the place's aesthetic is.

398
00:20:03,086 --> 00:20:05,646
Now I'm gonna do the most technical part of my talk.

399
00:20:05,646 --> 00:20:08,167
You have to know about hotspots,

400
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:11,307
which are the places where there will almost always be

401
00:20:11,307 --> 00:20:12,707
a decent chunk of players.

402
00:20:12,707 --> 00:20:15,408
I've circled them on this map of Celestia in here.

403
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,927
There are the major quest hubs.

404
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:21,609
And then over there on the east, you

405
00:20:21,609 --> 00:20:24,491
can see the transition between the major city

406
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:25,912
and the rest of the zone.

407
00:20:25,912 --> 00:20:29,275
Those are places you know will always be high traffic.

408
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:33,198
You can also see in yellow the other player paths.

409
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:34,739
The map actually clearly shows you

410
00:20:34,739 --> 00:20:36,620
where players will regularly be walking.

411
00:20:38,227 --> 00:20:39,448
Now, these are the cool spots.

412
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:41,128
There aren't many quests here.

413
00:20:41,128 --> 00:20:43,529
They require jumping puzzles to get to.

414
00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:46,490
The content there is optional,

415
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:49,872
or it's content that's limited.

416
00:20:49,872 --> 00:20:51,812
It's actually cool to put gatherables here

417
00:20:51,812 --> 00:20:55,014
as a way of intrinsically exploring,

418
00:20:55,014 --> 00:20:59,595
rewarding exploration, but the problem is

419
00:20:59,595 --> 00:21:02,076
that you can then make it so that people

420
00:21:02,076 --> 00:21:04,077
who are playing the game in a less explorative manner

421
00:21:04,077 --> 00:21:05,618
don't get anything, and that's bad too.

422
00:21:07,428 --> 00:21:10,931
I want to talk about the ways in some central design

423
00:21:10,931 --> 00:21:13,553
principles about shared world spawn systems.

424
00:21:13,553 --> 00:21:16,796
This is my read from the slide part of the talk.

425
00:21:16,796 --> 00:21:19,217
Spawn groups are spawn points that are managed together.

426
00:21:19,217 --> 00:21:22,400
Spawn minimum is the lowest before a respawn is triggered.

427
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,482
Spawn low is spawning is sped up.

428
00:21:25,482 --> 00:21:27,904
It's a threshold where if there are fewer

429
00:21:27,904 --> 00:21:31,186
than that number of items up, it'll be sped up.

430
00:21:31,186 --> 00:21:34,709
Spawn max is the maximum number of objects

431
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:37,231
that are allowed to exist on a single spawn group.

432
00:21:38,492 --> 00:21:41,255
The example is I could have an herb spawn group

433
00:21:41,255 --> 00:21:43,376
that has 30 potential points where an herb could spawn.

434
00:21:43,376 --> 00:21:45,098
A new herb will show up every 60 seconds.

435
00:21:45,098 --> 00:21:46,899
If the spawn minimum is five,

436
00:21:46,899 --> 00:21:49,902
there will never be less than five herbs spawned.

437
00:21:49,902 --> 00:21:51,443
You can check for this a bunch of ways.

438
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,205
You can have it check as frequently

439
00:21:53,205 --> 00:21:54,366
as your server will allow.

440
00:21:54,366 --> 00:21:56,707
You can have it check whenever an herb is gathered.

441
00:21:56,707 --> 00:21:58,529
It depends on your personal infrastructure.

442
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:05,213
Low is 10. When there are fewer than 10 herbs spawned on this theoretical spawn point,

443
00:22:05,213 --> 00:22:07,915
a new herb will spawn every 30 seconds instead of every 60.

444
00:22:07,915 --> 00:22:11,837
The max is 15. This is a really important thing about implementing

445
00:22:11,837 --> 00:22:18,621
gatherables in shared spaces. You almost never want to end up with a full spawn index.

446
00:22:18,621 --> 00:22:21,743
You want there to always be some variation where things are found.

447
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:23,946
And of course the optimal numbers

448
00:22:23,946 --> 00:22:25,689
and the way you set these things

449
00:22:25,689 --> 00:22:28,675
will vary a lot based on your individual design,

450
00:22:28,675 --> 00:22:30,999
your server structure, your population, all that stuff.

451
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:34,105
Okay, now back to the good part.

452
00:22:35,915 --> 00:22:39,938
There are a couple ways to implement item spawns.

453
00:22:39,938 --> 00:22:42,400
This one is an illustration of discrete spawn groups.

454
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,983
Every colored dot shares a spawn group

455
00:22:45,983 --> 00:22:48,465
with all the other dots that share its color.

456
00:22:48,465 --> 00:22:50,687
They don't influence each other at all.

457
00:22:50,687 --> 00:22:53,289
There's no what is called spawn migration,

458
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:56,772
which is when because people more frequently

459
00:22:56,772 --> 00:22:58,734
interact with spawns in one area,

460
00:22:58,734 --> 00:23:01,657
the active spawns move to less populated areas.

461
00:23:03,725 --> 00:23:05,245
This is the other implementation,

462
00:23:05,245 --> 00:23:06,925
all spawns in a single group,

463
00:23:06,925 --> 00:23:08,986
which maximizes spawn migration.

464
00:23:08,986 --> 00:23:12,586
This is good because it will eventually

465
00:23:12,586 --> 00:23:16,047
algorithmically reward exploration,

466
00:23:16,047 --> 00:23:19,668
but it's bad because after people have been playing

467
00:23:19,668 --> 00:23:22,508
in it for a while, as you can see,

468
00:23:22,508 --> 00:23:24,389
the hotspots have nothing in them.

469
00:23:24,389 --> 00:23:26,849
The places where players are more frequently,

470
00:23:26,849 --> 00:23:28,209
they're not just gonna find less,

471
00:23:28,209 --> 00:23:30,270
they're gonna find none.

472
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,410
Because every time a herb spawns there,

473
00:23:33,231 --> 00:23:37,316
and somebody collects it, it randomly rolls where else it can spawn.

474
00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:42,143
And, you know, odds as they work out, eventually they'll be clustered in the cold spots.

475
00:23:42,143 --> 00:23:45,568
Which is, again, great for the people who go to the cold spots.

476
00:23:45,568 --> 00:23:49,434
When you go there, there's a huge bonanza. You feel super rewarded for exploration.

477
00:23:50,967 --> 00:23:52,148
So the best is a hybrid.

478
00:23:52,148 --> 00:23:54,748
And I'm sorry that this is confusing.

479
00:23:54,748 --> 00:23:58,250
This is actually a simplified version

480
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:01,311
of what our spawn system looked like for Celestian.

481
00:24:01,311 --> 00:24:05,332
So you know what kind of stuff we're dealing with here.

482
00:24:05,332 --> 00:24:07,373
But the pink Saminy on the left is one.

483
00:24:08,342 --> 00:24:15,707
big spawn group, the violet on the bottom is a big spawn group, and the maroon on the upper right

484
00:24:15,707 --> 00:24:21,711
is a big spawn group. And then you'll see that the other colors, the cooler colors, are individual

485
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:30,417
spawn groups in the specific areas. This way, there will always be, basically take that yellow

486
00:24:30,417 --> 00:24:34,540
group in the middle as an example, there will always be at least a couple herbs up there.

487
00:24:35,772 --> 00:24:39,055
But there will always also be a higher concentration

488
00:24:39,055 --> 00:24:40,417
in those more remote areas.

489
00:24:40,417 --> 00:24:42,659
And so this is sort of the aftermath

490
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:44,520
of people being around there.

491
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,444
As you can see, there's still significant clustering

492
00:24:48,444 --> 00:24:49,845
in the hot spots.

493
00:24:49,845 --> 00:24:52,368
But there's no place where there's just nothing.

494
00:24:52,368 --> 00:24:55,250
Every region has at least a little bit

495
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:57,092
to offer, which is a good balance.

496
00:24:58,906 --> 00:25:02,071
Now I'm going to move away from that and just talk a little bit,

497
00:25:02,071 --> 00:25:05,215
really quick refresher on the different principles

498
00:25:05,215 --> 00:25:08,119
and how they're applied to the different genres.

499
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:10,142
Platformers and nonlinear action games

500
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:13,700
primarily use their gatherables to alert players

501
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,762
to alternate paths, reward memory and backtracking.

502
00:25:16,762 --> 00:25:18,903
For instance, if you're wandering around

503
00:25:18,903 --> 00:25:21,784
and you see a piece of set gear in a Castlevania game

504
00:25:21,784 --> 00:25:22,925
and you can't reach it yet,

505
00:25:22,925 --> 00:25:25,746
you know that you can remember it and come back to it.

506
00:25:25,746 --> 00:25:27,467
That's a different kind of exploration

507
00:25:27,467 --> 00:25:30,688
and a different kind of reward, but it's really important.

508
00:25:30,688 --> 00:25:31,909
They can also challenge skills.

509
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:34,290
If you see an item that you want

510
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:37,371
and it's at the end of a really complicated jumping puzzle,

511
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:39,272
that motivates you to do that puzzle.

512
00:25:41,431 --> 00:25:43,513
In RPGs and story exploration games,

513
00:25:43,513 --> 00:25:47,038
treat every space as a mini open world.

514
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:49,260
If somebody is wandering through an old house,

515
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,043
you might think that these principles don't apply,

516
00:25:52,043 --> 00:25:53,825
but they do, just on a smaller scale.

517
00:25:53,825 --> 00:25:59,412
You can also really leverage environmental storytelling

518
00:25:59,412 --> 00:26:00,713
in these kind of games, like

519
00:26:01,506 --> 00:26:04,708
The placement of items has huge impacts for characters.

520
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:08,090
We actually often find characters or find players

521
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:11,012
and streamers telling stories about, well,

522
00:26:11,012 --> 00:26:13,734
why was there a chair in this bathroom?

523
00:26:13,734 --> 00:26:18,958
Or why was there a mystical jewel in the shoe box

524
00:26:18,958 --> 00:26:20,999
in this abandoned shoe store?

525
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:24,301
People love making up their own little stories

526
00:26:24,301 --> 00:26:28,824
as to why things are in certain places.

527
00:26:28,824 --> 00:26:30,886
And also, there's always secret tunnel.

528
00:26:31,955 --> 00:26:34,677
Everybody loves finding a secret tunnel,

529
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:38,321
even if it doesn't actually offer any gameplay advantage,

530
00:26:38,321 --> 00:26:40,082
even if it's totally missable,

531
00:26:40,082 --> 00:26:42,725
because good secrets are often missable.

532
00:26:42,725 --> 00:26:45,647
You still reward them by putting some gatherables

533
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:49,010
or collectibles in there that are non-essential.

534
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,722
And more linear and narrow worlds,

535
00:26:53,722 --> 00:26:57,244
you have to be more careful to match the visibility of items

536
00:26:57,244 --> 00:27:01,107
and the difficulty of obtaining them to the play style

537
00:27:01,107 --> 00:27:02,848
that those items are compatible with.

538
00:27:02,848 --> 00:27:05,590
You shouldn't put narrative items

539
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:09,092
between really intense content challenges,

540
00:27:09,092 --> 00:27:11,754
because often the kind of people who are really just

541
00:27:11,754 --> 00:27:14,335
playing the game for narrative won't be able to do

542
00:27:14,335 --> 00:27:15,516
the content challenges.

543
00:27:16,137 --> 00:27:22,343
One thing I like to do with hiding items behind content challenges is to...

544
00:27:23,322 --> 00:27:27,265
put an item that's really only usable by high-skilled players

545
00:27:27,265 --> 00:27:29,707
behind a high-skilled challenge.

546
00:27:29,707 --> 00:27:33,651
So if there's a cool item that massively lowers your defense

547
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:35,452
but raises your attack, something

548
00:27:35,452 --> 00:27:38,295
that only a skilled player would be able to get good use of,

549
00:27:38,295 --> 00:27:40,176
you can hide that behind a content challenge,

550
00:27:40,176 --> 00:27:42,418
make it visible so that players know

551
00:27:42,418 --> 00:27:44,279
that it's a reward for doing that.

552
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:46,441
And it's a reward that is suited specifically

553
00:27:46,441 --> 00:27:47,362
to their play style.

554
00:27:49,526 --> 00:27:54,827
And one of the big provisos is only include completionist

555
00:27:54,827 --> 00:27:57,968
tasks if a game is designed for replayability.

556
00:27:57,968 --> 00:27:59,529
It's like that example I gave earlier,

557
00:27:59,529 --> 00:28:04,090
where you hide one of your checklist collectibles

558
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:06,030
in a really obscure place.

559
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:09,151
Player spent two hours getting through your level,

560
00:28:09,151 --> 00:28:12,492
gets to the end of it, and is at 99%, and is super frustrated.

561
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:17,142
If your game is designed to have people play through it

562
00:28:17,142 --> 00:28:18,984
a bunch of times and you know for a fact

563
00:28:18,984 --> 00:28:21,446
based on playtesting that people enjoy doing that,

564
00:28:21,446 --> 00:28:24,109
then go ahead and pull gags like that, that's fine.

565
00:28:24,109 --> 00:28:26,391
But if you really think that players are going to be

566
00:28:26,391 --> 00:28:29,354
mostly playing through it once for the story,

567
00:28:29,354 --> 00:28:30,876
be a little nicer to them.

568
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:35,820
And this is sort of my lightning round things

569
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,942
that don't fit on any of the other slides.

570
00:28:37,942 --> 00:28:38,863
People like secrets.

571
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:42,441
Visibility is good, and you've gotta decide

572
00:28:42,441 --> 00:28:44,862
how much visibility you want and keep it consistent.

573
00:28:44,862 --> 00:28:48,164
Like, a good example is the balloon challenges in Zelda,

574
00:28:48,164 --> 00:28:50,285
where they'll hide them somewhat,

575
00:28:50,285 --> 00:28:52,307
but they won't ever be completely hidden.

576
00:28:52,307 --> 00:28:54,408
Breadcrumb trails work, everybody knows how they work,

577
00:28:54,408 --> 00:28:56,709
everybody sees them, instantly understands them.

578
00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:00,412
teach people where to look and do it early.

579
00:29:00,412 --> 00:29:02,413
Too many empty things is bad.

580
00:29:02,413 --> 00:29:04,934
If sometimes items are in barrels,

581
00:29:04,934 --> 00:29:05,895
but 99% of barrels are empty,

582
00:29:05,895 --> 00:29:09,377
people are gonna be either stop looking in barrels

583
00:29:09,377 --> 00:29:11,999
or look in every barrels while getting increasingly furious

584
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:12,719
with you as they do it.

585
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:16,762
The same thing as achievements.

586
00:29:16,762 --> 00:29:20,184
They're nice, but they can be compulsive.

587
00:29:20,184 --> 00:29:22,805
The number one complaint I get about gatherables

588
00:29:22,805 --> 00:29:24,246
is there were too many of them.

589
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:30,026
I felt like they were unnecessary and I want to get my platinum trophy.

590
00:29:30,026 --> 00:29:34,348
I'll never get my platinum trophy because of all those damn collectibles.

591
00:29:34,348 --> 00:29:40,711
And that's something you really do want to be conscious of because often the kind of people

592
00:29:40,711 --> 00:29:46,474
who are really valuing this sort of exploration and emotional engagement with your game, they aren't.

593
00:29:46,772 --> 00:29:48,655
they aren't the completionists.

594
00:29:48,655 --> 00:29:53,180
And sometimes the people who are really into your combat system

595
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,002
won't want to do all of the exploration.

596
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:58,846
And you sort of have to weigh their respective wants

597
00:29:58,846 --> 00:29:59,828
and needs against each other.

598
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,228
There are exceptions to all of these rules.

599
00:30:03,228 --> 00:30:05,430
I've pointed out a few of them now,

600
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,432
but it's sort of, this is a guide

601
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:10,455
that you should follow, some principles to keep in mind.

602
00:30:10,455 --> 00:30:13,278
You'll know when it's time to break them.

603
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:14,979
But when you decide to break them,

604
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,221
make sure you subject that aspect of your design

605
00:30:17,221 --> 00:30:20,344
to increased scrutiny and to increased player testing

606
00:30:20,344 --> 00:30:23,748
to make sure you haven't made something frustrating.

607
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:29,846
So just play with it.

608
00:30:29,846 --> 00:30:33,148
Like, my favorite part of implementation

609
00:30:33,148 --> 00:30:35,610
is actually flying around a map,

610
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:38,673
looking for cool stuff that my artists have put in

611
00:30:38,673 --> 00:30:43,197
that I can enhance with the gatherables I put in there.

612
00:30:43,197 --> 00:30:45,258
I've actually been, not entirely,

613
00:30:45,258 --> 00:30:47,380
but somewhat ruined for MMOs

614
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,342
because I'm used to being able to fly around,

615
00:30:50,342 --> 00:30:53,705
look at cool stuff, be the herb fairy.

616
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:58,052
put everything in all of the cool nooks and crannies.

617
00:30:58,052 --> 00:31:01,314
And when I am trying to do that in real MMOs,

618
00:31:01,314 --> 00:31:03,635
I'm like, oh wow, there's a really cool tree.

619
00:31:03,635 --> 00:31:05,396
I wonder if it could climb it.

620
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:07,617
Oh, it's full of wolves.

621
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:09,018
Why are there wolves in the tree?

622
00:31:09,018 --> 00:31:09,479
I don't know.

623
00:31:09,479 --> 00:31:12,020
And it's disrupting my exploration experience.

624
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,641
It's fun to place these,

625
00:31:13,641 --> 00:31:17,303
and if you don't find it fun to place these,

626
00:31:17,303 --> 00:31:20,425
see if there's somebody else at your studio

627
00:31:20,425 --> 00:31:21,766
who actually does enjoy this.

628
00:31:21,766 --> 00:31:22,867
Because.

629
00:31:25,028 --> 00:31:27,969
I, you know, this is a task that I often find

630
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,430
when I'm doing consulting, has been given to

631
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:34,871
whoever didn't say not it when the tasks were given out.

632
00:31:34,871 --> 00:31:37,632
And it's something that especially people

633
00:31:37,632 --> 00:31:41,353
with interdisciplinary interest in art and design

634
00:31:41,353 --> 00:31:46,295
or narrative and design are often really good at this task.

635
00:31:46,295 --> 00:31:48,455
So when you're looking to assign this task,

636
00:31:48,455 --> 00:31:50,136
when you're looking to volunteer for this task,

637
00:31:50,136 --> 00:31:52,276
know that those are kind of the skills

638
00:31:52,276 --> 00:31:53,977
that are shared between them.

639
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,804
And I think this is a really cool design space

640
00:31:57,804 --> 00:32:00,488
because it's something that there

641
00:32:00,488 --> 00:32:01,950
are very few experts on this.

642
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:04,814
And so you have a chance to innovate with this in a way

643
00:32:04,814 --> 00:32:08,158
that you might not have with some other systems that

644
00:32:08,158 --> 00:32:10,561
are a similar level of complexity.

645
00:32:11,242 --> 00:32:14,765
So go out there, explore, have fun.

646
00:32:14,765 --> 00:32:17,587
If you have any questions, please feel free

647
00:32:17,587 --> 00:32:19,889
to hit me up on Twitter, email me.

648
00:32:19,889 --> 00:32:22,331
I will certainly tell you about this.

649
00:32:22,331 --> 00:32:24,093
If you are colorblind and you could not see

650
00:32:24,093 --> 00:32:27,155
the details on that map really well, I apologize.

651
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:28,076
Please email me.

652
00:32:29,456 --> 00:32:31,337
I will try to upload them,

653
00:32:31,337 --> 00:32:33,898
some of the colorblind sensitive slides I've made,

654
00:32:33,898 --> 00:32:37,360
but they're less legible to everyone else.

655
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,681
And so if you're interested in versions of this map

656
00:32:40,681 --> 00:32:43,902
that are designed for teaching people

657
00:32:43,902 --> 00:32:46,063
who are colorblind to use these systems,

658
00:32:46,063 --> 00:32:48,464
please do get in contact with me.

659
00:32:48,464 --> 00:32:49,085
Thank you guys very much.

660
00:32:49,085 --> 00:32:50,965
I don't know, how much time do I have for questions?

661
00:32:50,965 --> 00:32:51,906
Okay, we are out of time.
