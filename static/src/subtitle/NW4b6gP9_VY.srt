1
00:00:07,362 --> 00:00:10,123
So I'll start with just a short introduction.

2
00:00:10,123 --> 00:00:15,464
My name is Kjartan Emilsson, CEO and co-founder at Solfar.

3
00:00:15,464 --> 00:00:19,146
Like I said, it's a small studio based in Iceland.

4
00:00:19,146 --> 00:00:22,247
We are three co-founders that all of us came,

5
00:00:22,247 --> 00:00:23,887
were working previously at CCP Games,

6
00:00:23,887 --> 00:00:28,349
so we've been like, our background is really in gaming.

7
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:34,631
But we decided to jump ship to do a pure VR studio startup

8
00:00:34,631 --> 00:00:35,391
in late 2014.

9
00:00:36,507 --> 00:00:39,769
And what fascinated us with VR is the concept

10
00:00:39,769 --> 00:00:41,590
basically of putting people in impossible situations.

11
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,132
And that's kind of the theme of the type of products

12
00:00:44,132 --> 00:00:44,972
that we're looking at.

13
00:00:44,972 --> 00:00:46,934
And, but if, as this talk is specifically about Everest VR,

14
00:00:46,934 --> 00:00:48,315
there might be a question why we chose Everest specifically.

15
00:00:58,938 --> 00:01:05,821
And like I said, one of our goals as a company was to put people in difficult situations,

16
00:01:05,821 --> 00:01:11,563
and Everest is certainly one that most people will not have the opportunity to experience.

17
00:01:11,563 --> 00:01:20,586
And we also thought, as gamers, that we didn't feel that VR at that point had...

18
00:01:21,558 --> 00:01:28,741
enough knowledge about how people react and how people play VR games, such that we felt

19
00:01:28,741 --> 00:01:33,504
confident in doing a bet on a single game with maybe two, three year budget or something

20
00:01:33,504 --> 00:01:39,667
like that. So we wanted to try out several different things and experiential products

21
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:40,788
is one of those.

22
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:48,779
After having been working now on Everest for the last half a year or so, it taught us an

23
00:01:48,779 --> 00:01:55,225
enormous amount of things and I think all of these things will trickle back into the

24
00:01:55,225 --> 00:02:01,711
games because you need to master a little bit how to create emotions in VR and how to

25
00:02:01,711 --> 00:02:05,695
control them and experiential products are good for that.

26
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:12,954
But why Everest? There's another reason for that, which is the name of the other company

27
00:02:12,954 --> 00:02:19,598
that is involved in Everest, called RVX. It's actually a special effects company based in

28
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,621
Iceland as well, a good friend of ours. And they have been working on a lot of Hollywood

29
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:27,423
movies, notably Gravity, and they have been working on Everest as well.

30
00:02:28,335 --> 00:02:30,716
And through that, they had actually acquired

31
00:02:30,716 --> 00:02:33,677
sort of a know-how to create landscapes

32
00:02:33,677 --> 00:02:35,937
using advanced techniques.

33
00:02:35,937 --> 00:02:38,678
So in this talk, I'm just going to go through

34
00:02:38,678 --> 00:02:40,299
basically all the steps that we went through

35
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:43,059
to create this product.

36
00:02:43,059 --> 00:02:44,860
And it's not launched yet, but it's not ready,

37
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,000
but it will be soon.

38
00:02:47,061 --> 00:02:51,342
But first I want to show you very quickly what this product looked like one year ago.

39
00:02:51,342 --> 00:02:55,044
It was basically the pitch that we were making.

40
00:02:55,044 --> 00:03:01,567
So our goal with Everest was to try to recreate the emotions that you have at various milestones

41
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:03,908
that you have in climbing Everest.

42
00:03:03,908 --> 00:03:05,969
For us that was the most important thing.

43
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:08,910
We didn't want to do a climbing simulator.

44
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:13,632
at this stage, but really just mastering how to create these emotions.

45
00:03:13,632 --> 00:03:16,833
And there are all kinds of emotions involved in climbing a mountain.

46
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:22,695
It's not only vertical, it's also a sense of awe, a sense of beauty, a sense of foreboding,

47
00:03:22,695 --> 00:03:22,775
etc.

48
00:03:25,967 --> 00:03:29,269
What we do is basically we create first-person experiences

49
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:32,731
that are pretty well framed within a given milestone

50
00:03:32,731 --> 00:03:37,814
of climbing Everest, and give you simple things to do,

51
00:03:37,814 --> 00:03:39,375
but it's not very complex.

52
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:42,758
For us, this had to be a very accessible product.

53
00:03:42,758 --> 00:03:46,660
And we go through some of the major milestones, like I said.

54
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,142
Base camp, Kumbu Icefall, the Lhasa phase,

55
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:52,124
camp four, which is just above the death zone,

56
00:03:52,124 --> 00:03:53,785
the Hillary step, that's the one that we've

57
00:03:53,785 --> 00:03:55,166
been climbing at this show.

58
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:57,069
And then finally the summit.

59
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:58,189
And so yeah, this was our storyboard that we make.

60
00:03:58,189 --> 00:04:03,971
We started designing this with the interesting design

61
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:08,813
for Vive because we thought it was

62
00:04:08,813 --> 00:04:11,634
cool to try to experiment a little bit what you could do

63
00:04:11,634 --> 00:04:12,875
with a room scale tracking.

64
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:17,016
But then we also have an interaction design

65
00:04:17,016 --> 00:04:20,378
that works for Rift and also just a sitting experience.

66
00:04:20,378 --> 00:04:22,478
Though obviously it might be less immersive.

67
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,930
So here's a few of the milestones that we have.

68
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,431
Base camp is one.

69
00:04:29,431 --> 00:04:32,471
It's basically like you're witnessing the puja ceremony

70
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:35,092
where the Sherpas do offerings to the mountain gods

71
00:04:35,092 --> 00:04:36,852
at the start of the season.

72
00:04:36,852 --> 00:04:39,053
We wanted this to be a very simple scene,

73
00:04:39,053 --> 00:04:41,533
but serene, early morning.

74
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:44,254
And you sort of like take some food

75
00:04:44,254 --> 00:04:46,174
and give it to the gods,

76
00:04:46,174 --> 00:04:47,914
so through this altar that they raise.

77
00:04:47,914 --> 00:04:49,715
And then there's a crow that comes,

78
00:04:49,715 --> 00:04:52,615
and depending on which way she flies, or it flies,

79
00:04:53,832 --> 00:04:56,753
it's a good omen for the expeditions.

80
00:04:56,753 --> 00:04:59,994
And then we have more dramatic kind of a situation,

81
00:04:59,994 --> 00:05:03,135
the Kumbu Icefall is like a tumbling glacier

82
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:06,237
that is at the start of the mountain.

83
00:05:06,237 --> 00:05:08,738
And here, of course, there are all kinds of opportunity

84
00:05:08,738 --> 00:05:11,039
to recreate a vertigo and also experiment

85
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,340
with the type of movement that you can do.

86
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,641
And so you're crossing crevices on ladders

87
00:05:16,641 --> 00:05:17,841
that actually Sherpa's put up there.

88
00:05:17,841 --> 00:05:18,361
And then Hillary's Step, it's a...

89
00:05:22,432 --> 00:05:27,395
It's one of the more dangerous hurdles on the Everest,

90
00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:30,858
because it's a slightly technical part of the climb.

91
00:05:30,858 --> 00:05:33,099
But it's in a death zone, and this

92
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:34,760
is where people are really tired,

93
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,041
and they are running out of oxygen.

94
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:39,504
And there's only one file that can go through.

95
00:05:39,504 --> 00:05:42,626
So there are often lots of incidents

96
00:05:42,626 --> 00:05:43,927
that happen at this stage.

97
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,188
This is just before the summit.

98
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,384
And you might have had the opportunity to try it here already.

99
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:58,771
I was really pleased yesterday, Dean Hall, the game designer at DayZ, he's actually gone

100
00:05:58,771 --> 00:05:59,292
to Everest.

101
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:05,077
He's a friend of ours, he's been to Iceland and all, but we put him into a hilarious step

102
00:06:05,077 --> 00:06:06,559
yesterday and he got goosebumps.

103
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:10,442
So if somebody has climbed Everest, get goosebumps, we're happy.

104
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,332
Yeah, no, there's a summit, obviously.

105
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:17,294
But I'll skip through this and go to the part

106
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,116
of building a mountain.

107
00:06:19,116 --> 00:06:23,880
Everest is a big mountain, and building it

108
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,162
takes a little bit of effort.

109
00:06:26,162 --> 00:06:28,504
And especially knowing the constraints of VR,

110
00:06:28,504 --> 00:06:31,886
as you probably all know, where you

111
00:06:31,886 --> 00:06:36,550
have to put yourself under the constraints of having

112
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,833
90 frames a second, overdraw 140%.

113
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:42,642
and the min spec of 970.

114
00:06:42,642 --> 00:06:46,825
It's quite a challenge to get at least graphical quality

115
00:06:46,825 --> 00:06:49,086
to a level that is acceptable.

116
00:06:49,086 --> 00:06:52,268
But we really wanted that to be the case in this case.

117
00:06:52,268 --> 00:06:55,430
So we worked a lot on the optimization part of it.

118
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,792
And throughout, I'll tell you a little bit the tools

119
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:58,873
that we're using.

120
00:06:58,873 --> 00:07:00,394
We don't have many programmers.

121
00:07:00,394 --> 00:07:03,035
We actually have only one programmer in our team.

122
00:07:03,035 --> 00:07:06,538
So a lot of things we do are optimizations and shaders.

123
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:08,679
And then we use tools from third parties

124
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:10,200
that we integrate into the Unreal Engine.

125
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,670
But let's start first from the source.

126
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,251
So RVX, as I told you, is the special effects company

127
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:21,612
that has been working with the techniques

128
00:07:21,612 --> 00:07:23,553
of stereophotogrammetry.

129
00:07:23,553 --> 00:07:26,133
So for those that are not familiar with that technique,

130
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:31,375
it basically consists of if you want to acquire a 3D

131
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,275
landscape, for example.

132
00:07:34,644 --> 00:07:38,466
You basically take pictures of it from numerous directions,

133
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:41,507
and as many directions as you can,

134
00:07:41,507 --> 00:07:43,928
and with knowing also the position of the cameras.

135
00:07:43,928 --> 00:07:48,009
And then you take all this data of photos,

136
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,650
basically two-dimensional photos,

137
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:53,332
that have 3D information on how they were taken.

138
00:07:53,332 --> 00:07:56,853
And you run that through a computer

139
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:59,834
to crunch for a long time,

140
00:07:59,834 --> 00:08:02,695
and then recreate the 3D mesh that is underlying,

141
00:08:02,695 --> 00:08:03,596
and also the color maps.

142
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:15,540
So in this case, Davi, this is the creative director of DarbyX, he actually was at Deverest and took some photos.

143
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,122
A lot of photos actually.

144
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:21,464
And this is for example the Khumbu Icefall.

145
00:08:21,464 --> 00:08:24,987
You can see like little dots there, it's a tent actually.

146
00:08:24,987 --> 00:08:28,770
To give you a little bit of a sense of scale there.

147
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,131
And then there were like...

148
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:40,004
helicopter rides. So one thing with this for Everest, you can fly a helicopter up to a

149
00:08:40,004 --> 00:08:44,967
certain altitude, but after that it loses lift, so you cannot actually capture all the

150
00:08:44,967 --> 00:08:50,090
summit. So in this case, we actually had to also do sculpting, hand sculpting of some

151
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:56,274
parts of the mountain. But otherwise, it was basically the whole mountain that was there.

152
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:02,782
Then we use the service of another Icelandic company

153
00:09:02,782 --> 00:09:03,902
called Designing Reality.

154
00:09:03,902 --> 00:09:08,244
So they have a custom solution to do stereophotogrammetry

155
00:09:08,244 --> 00:09:12,046
that they build themselves and the software as well.

156
00:09:12,046 --> 00:09:16,787
It's kind of like a mini supercomputer in a box.

157
00:09:16,787 --> 00:09:20,849
28 cores, 128 gigs of RAM, six GeForce Titan X and SLI.

158
00:09:22,293 --> 00:09:26,254
bunch of straight SSD and all this database of photos,

159
00:09:26,254 --> 00:09:28,634
high definition photos that you put in.

160
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:31,295
In the end, you get I think something like 105 gigapixel

161
00:09:31,295 --> 00:09:34,316
of point cloud data.

162
00:09:34,316 --> 00:09:39,717
And the resulting mesh is 1.5 trillion polygons,

163
00:09:39,717 --> 00:09:41,017
which is quite a lot.

164
00:09:41,017 --> 00:09:48,819
And I think it took about two or three months to calculate.

165
00:09:48,819 --> 00:09:51,620
So this was like all part of pre-production for this.

166
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:57,157
And after that, you need to somehow get hold of that data

167
00:09:57,157 --> 00:10:02,058
because the resulting meshes, of course, you need to adjust it

168
00:10:02,058 --> 00:10:04,118
a little bit.

169
00:10:04,118 --> 00:10:05,879
We split things up in 126 patches,

170
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:07,339
and I explained to you why.

171
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:11,560
Internally, it's easier to work with smaller data sets,

172
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,380
in Maya, for example.

173
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:19,522
And so we reduced down to 24 million polygons in the end.

174
00:10:21,211 --> 00:10:23,532
But note also that in the experience,

175
00:10:23,532 --> 00:10:25,953
we need to recreate near field often.

176
00:10:25,953 --> 00:10:28,754
And the near field actually takes more polygons

177
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:30,675
than the whole range mountain.

178
00:10:30,675 --> 00:10:34,917
Because you need to have a lot of three dimensional detail

179
00:10:34,917 --> 00:10:38,058
in VR as people can get very close to the surfaces.

180
00:10:38,058 --> 00:10:42,180
You don't want to break the immersion by failing on that.

181
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:47,411
So coming to Unreal, we do all our work in Unreal,

182
00:10:47,411 --> 00:10:50,232
and here we show you a bit,

183
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:53,212
this is like the whole range that we have.

184
00:10:53,212 --> 00:10:55,493
We have this far field as well,

185
00:10:55,493 --> 00:10:57,133
which is in a much less resolution.

186
00:10:57,133 --> 00:11:00,894
And then you see the little patch in the middle there,

187
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:03,034
that's the actual average range.

188
00:11:03,034 --> 00:11:05,755
I don't remember the size of it,

189
00:11:05,755 --> 00:11:08,135
I think it's about three or four kilometers on the side.

190
00:11:11,798 --> 00:11:17,845
So there's like four big patches there that take care of the far field.

191
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:22,390
But then this range itself, we split up in this 126 patches.

192
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:30,520
And so they were both the reasons to do that was to be able to work with it in a healthy manner.

193
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:36,501
And also to be able to do visual culling of these meshes.

194
00:11:36,501 --> 00:11:39,923
So like often when you position yourself somewhere

195
00:11:39,923 --> 00:11:43,086
within a scene you don't see much of the range

196
00:11:43,086 --> 00:11:46,149
so we can get away with losing all of it.

197
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:48,631
But we still wanted this to be able to run

198
00:11:48,631 --> 00:11:51,653
the whole scene in one scene.

199
00:11:51,653 --> 00:11:54,936
So here you see a little bit more of the patches there.

200
00:11:57,021 --> 00:12:00,844
I think each patch like this is typically about maybe 100,000

201
00:12:00,844 --> 00:12:02,025
to 200,000 polygons.

202
00:12:02,025 --> 00:12:03,646
And at this point, also, there's a lot of hand tweaking

203
00:12:03,646 --> 00:12:09,490
that goes into choosing the right edges and stuff like that,

204
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:14,635
because edges are pretty important on mountains,

205
00:12:14,635 --> 00:12:17,417
as we see them a lot in profile.

206
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:21,900
So all these patches are not regular, actually.

207
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,042
It's adapted a little bit to the landscape.

208
00:12:27,415 --> 00:12:32,497
And then, like I said, there is also this near field that we need to recreate.

209
00:12:32,497 --> 00:12:36,299
This is like both snow and rocks.

210
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:40,402
And as I said, people go pretty close to objects,

211
00:12:40,402 --> 00:12:45,865
so there are probably a lot more polygons in this piece of snow than there is in the mountain behind.

212
00:12:49,156 --> 00:12:54,039
So for further reducing the mesh and make it runnable

213
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:57,400
in Unreal, we need to use some loading strategy.

214
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,562
And because this is like the mesh,

215
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:04,604
as it's, this is not the one point trillion polygon mesh,

216
00:13:04,604 --> 00:13:07,286
but it's the one we reduced, I guess,

217
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,786
to 25 million polygons.

218
00:13:08,786 --> 00:13:11,568
And you can see it's quite dense,

219
00:13:11,568 --> 00:13:13,629
like this little detail there.

220
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:16,951
And it's not a very intelligent tessellation.

221
00:13:18,296 --> 00:13:21,457
So for creating the LODs in Unreal,

222
00:13:21,457 --> 00:13:25,518
we use the tool SimpliGum that we integrated in Unreal.

223
00:13:25,518 --> 00:13:30,860
And this gives us a sequence of LODs.

224
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,881
We have five LOD levels, I guess.

225
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:35,401
This is the highest LOD level.

226
00:13:35,401 --> 00:13:39,863
And you can see successively finer and finer detail.

227
00:13:41,928 --> 00:13:45,752
And so typically, when you're looking at the mountain,

228
00:13:45,752 --> 00:13:49,796
you will have five different levels of LODs playing,

229
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,898
coming in, depending on your view.

230
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:55,361
And this has worked very well for us.

231
00:13:55,361 --> 00:13:58,764
This is just for those that want numbers,

232
00:13:58,764 --> 00:14:02,707
this is kind of the LOD hierarchy

233
00:14:02,707 --> 00:14:04,669
for a typical patch that we have.

234
00:14:08,212 --> 00:14:11,573
Then the next problem were the textures and the color maps,

235
00:14:11,573 --> 00:14:13,873
normal maps, occlusion.

236
00:14:13,873 --> 00:14:19,915
And if we wanted to have like 8K resolution on the textures,

237
00:14:19,915 --> 00:14:24,776
and as I said before, we wanted the whole scene to be able to,

238
00:14:24,776 --> 00:14:26,496
or the whole range to be possible in view.

239
00:14:26,496 --> 00:14:30,797
So that gave us a texture budget of 24 gigs, which

240
00:14:30,797 --> 00:14:32,837
was not the main spec.

241
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:41,053
So we had some problems resolving that until we found

242
00:14:41,053 --> 00:14:44,215
this solution, Granite for Unreal, which is quite

243
00:14:44,215 --> 00:14:44,836
remarkable.

244
00:14:44,836 --> 00:14:50,380
So basically what it does, it does both memory compression,

245
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,302
both on disk and in memory.

246
00:14:53,302 --> 00:14:56,183
And then it does streaming as well.

247
00:14:56,183 --> 00:14:58,625
And it integrates really nicely into Unreal.

248
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:02,368
So once you have created this, you basically create sort of

249
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:03,088
like a

250
00:15:04,332 --> 00:15:07,114
a database of textures or a texture atlas,

251
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,395
where you put all the textures that you have,

252
00:15:09,395 --> 00:15:13,338
and Granite then sort of optimizes the data structures.

253
00:15:13,338 --> 00:15:15,479
They do their own compression algorithm

254
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:18,601
that they claim are more suitable

255
00:15:18,601 --> 00:15:23,544
for a lot of typical scenes in 3D.

256
00:15:23,544 --> 00:15:25,385
And I can attest to that,

257
00:15:25,385 --> 00:15:28,087
that we've seen some pretty impressive compressions

258
00:15:28,087 --> 00:15:32,630
in there without seeing any difference in quality.

259
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,432
I can't really show you much picture of it here.

260
00:15:36,432 --> 00:15:39,135
This is a tool that we use to create the tile set.

261
00:15:39,135 --> 00:15:42,538
So in the end, you sort of think of just you're

262
00:15:42,538 --> 00:15:44,419
using an infinitely big texture.

263
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:46,201
It doesn't matter how big it is.

264
00:15:46,201 --> 00:15:49,784
And then within Unreal, you get texture proxy objects

265
00:15:49,784 --> 00:15:53,127
that you can use just as it was a normal texture in Unreal.

266
00:15:53,127 --> 00:15:56,129
And everything is done behind the scenes.

267
00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:59,312
So here I'm showing the texture atlas at different levels.

268
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:05,100
and I don't remember how many levels they have, like I think eight or something.

269
00:16:07,293 --> 00:16:13,898
And yeah, the texture compression that we got for

270
00:16:13,898 --> 00:16:17,381
this, I don't have the exact measurements because it has

271
00:16:17,381 --> 00:16:19,883
been changing a lot since we're still working on the product.

272
00:16:19,883 --> 00:16:23,065
But I remember distantly one case where we went from an 8

273
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:29,150
gig to 1 gig in our build in texture memory, and still using

274
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,832
8K texture everywhere and normal maps, et cetera.

275
00:16:31,832 --> 00:16:35,195
So we're quite happy with that solution.

276
00:16:38,481 --> 00:16:44,606
I also mention here TrueSky from Simul, even though we haven't had the time to integrate

277
00:16:44,606 --> 00:16:50,611
it yet, or not in the demos at least, but we think it's a great product, and we've done

278
00:16:50,611 --> 00:16:52,072
a lot of experiments with it.

279
00:16:52,072 --> 00:16:58,778
And at some point we need to start looking out whether we can tweak it to still fit within

280
00:16:58,778 --> 00:16:59,578
our frame budget.

281
00:17:00,176 --> 00:17:03,199
but the nice thing that it gives you is our volumetric clouds,

282
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,022
especially seen from above, and a very efficient kind

283
00:17:07,022 --> 00:17:08,043
of time of day effect.

284
00:17:08,043 --> 00:17:10,685
So by the way, that's something I

285
00:17:10,685 --> 00:17:14,749
forgot to tell you in the stereophotogrammetry process.

286
00:17:14,749 --> 00:17:16,250
When you get the color maps, they

287
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:20,654
do include the shadows from the time the pictures were taken.

288
00:17:20,654 --> 00:17:22,575
So part of the work that has to be done

289
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:24,397
is also to paint away the shadows

290
00:17:24,397 --> 00:17:25,898
so we can relit this thing.

291
00:17:26,727 --> 00:17:30,349
So there are some very patient artists painting shadows

292
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:34,511
of the whole mountain.

293
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:40,936
And then we do a lot of shader work for shading the scenes.

294
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:46,739
And the problem is that snow is not an easy thing to light.

295
00:17:46,739 --> 00:17:50,421
It's essentially white.

296
00:17:50,421 --> 00:17:52,463
And it has a lot of subsurface scattering.

297
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:59,525
We use a lot of Fresnel effects for those that are familiar with that.

298
00:17:59,525 --> 00:18:07,148
I can show you here, this is like the final frame for a given scene.

299
00:18:07,148 --> 00:18:12,670
This is a ledge, just the hiller step.

300
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,450
This is a column map.

301
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:15,731
This is a specular map.

302
00:18:15,731 --> 00:18:18,112
And this is a subsurface scattering.

303
00:18:18,112 --> 00:18:19,112
Combine it all to this.

304
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:24,238
And then you need to run this at 90 frames per second,

305
00:18:24,238 --> 00:18:26,099
and then you have to turn everything off.

306
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:31,523
So these are all the things we turn off in the Unreal Engine.

307
00:18:31,523 --> 00:18:34,746
And we just have this early z-pass on.

308
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,928
And so, yeah, a lot of the things

309
00:18:36,928 --> 00:18:40,110
are just done through the shader.

310
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,011
It looks pretty well.

311
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:48,385
And then for more interesting effects,

312
00:18:48,385 --> 00:18:51,627
we also played around with GameWorks Turbulence.

313
00:18:51,627 --> 00:18:54,569
And they had excellent people at NVIDIA working with us

314
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:55,510
and integrating that.

315
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:59,432
It's part of the integration into the Unreal Engine.

316
00:18:59,432 --> 00:19:02,534
And it's a very simple metaphor.

317
00:19:02,534 --> 00:19:05,937
Basically, they have a grid that you

318
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:08,718
can place in your level that has multiple levels.

319
00:19:09,734 --> 00:19:17,317
multiple cubes and in that grid they basically solve the fluid equations, Navier-Stokes fluid

320
00:19:17,317 --> 00:19:24,920
equations, so they can have like a dynamic simulation of fluids within that grid.

321
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:29,862
And it can also include a certain amount of convex collision volumes in that simulation.

322
00:19:29,862 --> 00:19:36,585
So like if you want to have like your flow break on a certain path, you can put certain

323
00:19:36,585 --> 00:19:37,085
volumes there.

324
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:41,853
And once you have that, you can basically spawn any GPU

325
00:19:41,853 --> 00:19:44,816
particles within that grid, and they will follow the velocity

326
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:47,358
fields, the turbulent field there.

327
00:19:47,358 --> 00:19:51,963
And then the nice thing, of course, is that the GPU

328
00:19:51,963 --> 00:19:55,827
particles, they also have screen space collision

329
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,890
detection on any objects, which is independent of the

330
00:19:58,890 --> 00:19:59,430
collision in the.

331
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,410
in the fluid simulation.

332
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,690
So, and we found it works extremely well

333
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:08,191
to recreate spin drifts and such weather effects

334
00:20:08,191 --> 00:20:11,412
that are very like, iconical for Everest,

335
00:20:11,412 --> 00:20:14,612
where you see them at the edge of the mountains,

336
00:20:14,612 --> 00:20:16,113
like little vortices, swim around.

337
00:20:16,113 --> 00:20:17,653
And the nice thing about this is that

338
00:20:17,653 --> 00:20:20,193
these are all real time and interactive,

339
00:20:20,193 --> 00:20:22,194
so like, when you're in the scene,

340
00:20:22,194 --> 00:20:24,254
you can actually like, put your hands in it

341
00:20:24,254 --> 00:20:25,674
and you'll stir the pots, so to speak,

342
00:20:25,674 --> 00:20:27,895
and the things drift around you, it's quite cool.

343
00:20:29,808 --> 00:20:32,549
Unfortunately, I couldn't get a video of this

344
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:35,551
because maybe you can sort of imagine how it looks.

345
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:40,694
And another technology that we use from NVIDIA is multi-res.

346
00:20:40,694 --> 00:20:44,156
This is like a VR-specific optimization.

347
00:20:44,156 --> 00:20:48,219
The idea there is that because of the pin cushion

348
00:20:48,219 --> 00:20:51,901
transformation that is necessary for the big lenses

349
00:20:51,901 --> 00:20:57,124
that are used in VR, you actually have less resolution

350
00:20:57,124 --> 00:20:58,285
on the pixels on the edge.

351
00:20:59,436 --> 00:21:03,317
And in addition to that, your visual acuity is also reduced

352
00:21:03,317 --> 00:21:04,157
on the edge anyway.

353
00:21:04,157 --> 00:21:07,198
And people tend to be looking always straight ahead in VR.

354
00:21:07,198 --> 00:21:09,758
Even though you can move your eyes, people usually

355
00:21:09,758 --> 00:21:11,218
don't do that.

356
00:21:11,218 --> 00:21:14,259
So the idea there is that you could get away

357
00:21:14,259 --> 00:21:17,640
with rendering with less density on the edges.

358
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:22,461
And if you just fade it, then the boundary,

359
00:21:22,461 --> 00:21:25,922
well, with some ATLiasing, it isn't really noticeable.

360
00:21:27,158 --> 00:21:30,320
So basically they create, they split the scenes

361
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,022
or the screen into like nine different grids

362
00:21:34,022 --> 00:21:38,545
and with less resolution on the edges.

363
00:21:38,545 --> 00:21:39,946
Then they blend it all together.

364
00:21:39,946 --> 00:21:43,087
And this gives, when we were measuring this,

365
00:21:43,087 --> 00:21:46,409
this gives us like one or two milliseconds per frame,

366
00:21:46,409 --> 00:21:49,671
which is huge for us, it's like 30% or something.

367
00:21:49,671 --> 00:21:51,552
So this.

368
00:21:52,927 --> 00:21:57,851
gives us the ability to squeeze more things into the actual scene.

369
00:21:57,851 --> 00:22:05,459
One thing to note though is that this affects post-processing effects and they have adapted

370
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:09,383
to a lot of the post-processing effects, but maybe not all of them.

371
00:22:09,383 --> 00:22:13,647
But we are not using any post-processing effects, so that was okay for us.

372
00:22:17,902 --> 00:22:19,963
And I can't notice this.

373
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:22,445
Like, I have a button that turns it on and off.

374
00:22:22,445 --> 00:22:24,346
And I never know whether it's on or off,

375
00:22:24,346 --> 00:22:27,428
except I see the frame rate increase a little bit.

376
00:22:27,428 --> 00:22:27,728
So that's great.

377
00:22:27,728 --> 00:22:31,791
So this was the parts of actually creating this mountain

378
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:36,093
and sort of the technical part of it.

379
00:22:36,093 --> 00:22:41,997
But then it comes to actually how it feels in VR.

380
00:22:41,997 --> 00:22:42,958
And I think they

381
00:22:44,335 --> 00:22:54,242
The thing that was maybe a little bit surprising is that none of all of this great graphical fidelity helped in any way in...

382
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:57,585
or of course it helped, but it wasn't enough to create an immersion.

383
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:02,795
when you actually stood there in this great environment.

384
00:23:02,795 --> 00:23:04,336
You had no sense of scale.

385
00:23:04,336 --> 00:23:08,678
You didn't know whether this was like a small hill

386
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,699
or a big mountain.

387
00:23:10,699 --> 00:23:12,419
You didn't really feel where to go, et cetera.

388
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:15,901
So there are all kinds of things that we need to look at

389
00:23:15,901 --> 00:23:19,303
just to make this like an immersive experience.

390
00:23:19,303 --> 00:23:20,643
And this is probably what is the most,

391
00:23:20,643 --> 00:23:23,025
the biggest learning experience for us.

392
00:23:24,618 --> 00:23:27,860
So of course there are lots of level design constraints

393
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,521
and how you can make your scenes.

394
00:23:29,521 --> 00:23:32,983
And we've been looking both at solutions

395
00:23:32,983 --> 00:23:35,345
to work with the room scale tracking

396
00:23:35,345 --> 00:23:38,067
and also with standing experience.

397
00:23:38,067 --> 00:23:39,468
And the different input mechanisms.

398
00:23:39,468 --> 00:23:42,690
This is of course all familiar to most of you

399
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,531
that have been working in the VR field.

400
00:23:44,531 --> 00:23:48,153
And the things that we came down to

401
00:23:48,153 --> 00:23:51,456
are pretty standard I guess now.

402
00:23:51,456 --> 00:23:52,736
It wasn't maybe standard like a...

403
00:23:53,462 --> 00:23:57,723
half a year ago or one year ago. But basically try to optimize

404
00:23:57,723 --> 00:24:02,504
the space and the level so that you can reposition the user at

405
00:24:02,504 --> 00:24:06,726
certain moments. So for example, you're crossing a ledge, then

406
00:24:06,726 --> 00:24:10,127
you're sort of like crossed maybe two and a half meters, so

407
00:24:10,127 --> 00:24:14,328
you don't have enough tracking space left. So the trick is then

408
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:18,950
to do a blink and reposition the player in the scene.

409
00:24:19,645 --> 00:24:21,928
And then suddenly you have more tracking space in front of you

410
00:24:21,928 --> 00:24:22,929
because you've turned.

411
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:25,371
But the problem, you can't turn them arbitrarily

412
00:24:25,371 --> 00:24:29,395
because you could lose orientation of where you were.

413
00:24:29,395 --> 00:24:31,337
And so this is a little tricky.

414
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:33,699
But by being smart about it, you can sort of

415
00:24:33,699 --> 00:24:36,442
create the sensation this space is much bigger than the room

416
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:38,023
that you're actually able to walk in.

417
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:43,923
And then the other thing that was, of course,

418
00:24:43,923 --> 00:24:46,564
really good news for us,

419
00:24:46,564 --> 00:24:49,946
we didn't really know it beforehand,

420
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:52,628
but is to find out that vertical movement

421
00:24:52,628 --> 00:24:55,309
does not induce motion sickness.

422
00:24:55,309 --> 00:25:00,572
And because usually if you do horizontal movement in VR,

423
00:25:00,572 --> 00:25:03,013
where you move in horizontal path

424
00:25:03,013 --> 00:25:05,015
and you're not moving physically yourself,

425
00:25:05,015 --> 00:25:08,456
that's like a very immediate motion sickness.

426
00:25:09,396 --> 00:25:11,377
But if you go up, there's none.

427
00:25:11,377 --> 00:25:14,939
And that's good for a mountain product.

428
00:25:14,939 --> 00:25:18,141
So we have a lot of mechanisms where you're actually

429
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,862
climbing ropes and ladders and stuff like that.

430
00:25:20,862 --> 00:25:23,324
And there is an infinite amount of vertical space

431
00:25:23,324 --> 00:25:24,744
in tracking in this case.

432
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:30,261
Another thing that we thought a lot about

433
00:25:30,261 --> 00:25:33,384
was how to do establishing shots.

434
00:25:33,384 --> 00:25:37,667
Because we are partly telling stories in this product,

435
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:40,750
like for each sort of scene, we want

436
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:43,011
to introduce it a little bit and explain

437
00:25:43,011 --> 00:25:44,513
what is happening there.

438
00:25:44,513 --> 00:25:47,815
So you want to be able to show some shots that

439
00:25:47,815 --> 00:25:49,657
sort of establish the scene where you are.

440
00:25:49,657 --> 00:25:53,080
Standard stuff in movie making, but it's

441
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,361
quite difficult to do in VR if you

442
00:25:55,361 --> 00:25:57,063
are doing it in full immersion.

443
00:25:58,775 --> 00:26:02,597
And, but at the same time we wanted to get that feeling

444
00:26:02,597 --> 00:26:05,259
that you have when like you're looking down

445
00:26:05,259 --> 00:26:07,040
to the landscape from high above

446
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,501
and it's very majestic feeling.

447
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:11,883
And usually that is not a good idea

448
00:26:11,883 --> 00:26:14,624
because again it leads to motion sickness

449
00:26:14,624 --> 00:26:17,205
when you move like that in the scene.

450
00:26:17,205 --> 00:26:20,647
But what we found out by accident, in a way,

451
00:26:20,647 --> 00:26:22,728
was that if you put a frame to start with,

452
00:26:25,995 --> 00:26:30,818
and you accustom the player to just look like at a cutscene really in the frame.

453
00:26:30,818 --> 00:26:35,381
It's not an actual cutscene, we actually put the player in a black box with a window

454
00:26:35,381 --> 00:26:36,382
and then we just move the box.

455
00:26:36,382 --> 00:26:41,705
But it feels like it's a movie playing on the screen and you're just standing there.

456
00:26:42,707 --> 00:26:45,929
and there you can have all kinds of shots with rotation and everything and that's okay

457
00:26:45,929 --> 00:26:51,291
but at a certain moment what we do is that we convert to

458
00:26:51,291 --> 00:26:53,473
linear velocity shots

459
00:26:53,473 --> 00:26:55,874
and with just cuts so there's no rotation

460
00:26:55,874 --> 00:26:57,194
and we dissolve the frame away

461
00:26:58,384 --> 00:27:02,546
And we found out that if you start with a frame like that and then you dissolve it,

462
00:27:02,546 --> 00:27:06,188
people still feel anchored somehow in the room.

463
00:27:06,188 --> 00:27:10,570
And they do get like a sensation of like, you know, the floor just went out under you.

464
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:14,412
But they don't get sick, or at least very, very few people have gotten sick.

465
00:27:14,412 --> 00:27:19,635
And we were quite happy to have that because once you're flying like that,

466
00:27:19,635 --> 00:27:23,416
it gives you like a great sense of majesty for the whole thing.

467
00:27:24,868 --> 00:27:30,112
Because otherwise we wouldn't have to put you in a cockpit, for example, helicopter,

468
00:27:30,112 --> 00:27:32,553
which we tried and really didn't like.

469
00:27:32,553 --> 00:27:36,396
And other people sometimes put a platform under your feet, and it's kind of immersion

470
00:27:36,396 --> 00:27:37,757
breaking.

471
00:27:37,757 --> 00:27:39,838
So we're happy with that solution.

472
00:27:39,838 --> 00:27:49,364
That brings me to some things that I like to call the reality cues, which are like this

473
00:27:49,364 --> 00:27:50,625
small little psychological...

474
00:27:51,054 --> 00:27:54,355
cues or pokes that you can poke your brain with,

475
00:27:54,355 --> 00:27:58,197
and that sort of help in establishing what some people

476
00:27:58,197 --> 00:28:01,258
have called the reality contract,

477
00:28:01,258 --> 00:28:03,738
which is when your body sort of agrees

478
00:28:03,738 --> 00:28:09,480
that what it is experiencing is there and it is real.

479
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,162
And you need to hit a few check boxes like that,

480
00:28:13,162 --> 00:28:16,143
and then suddenly that happens.

481
00:28:16,143 --> 00:28:19,164
And one of them, for example, is touching things.

482
00:28:20,252 --> 00:28:26,004
It's extremely powerful to touch things and see the world react to it.

483
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:29,191
It sort of gives you a sense that it is there.

484
00:28:30,123 --> 00:28:32,504
And we try to integrate as much,

485
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:34,025
and it doesn't need to be much,

486
00:28:34,025 --> 00:28:37,207
but as much as possible, when you touch the scene,

487
00:28:37,207 --> 00:28:38,547
you can feel some kind of reaction.

488
00:28:38,547 --> 00:28:43,570
So you have gloves in the, or mittens, in the experience.

489
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:48,172
And we let the gloves block collide on surfaces,

490
00:28:48,172 --> 00:28:50,513
and gives you a small tactile feedback on it.

491
00:28:50,513 --> 00:28:52,655
And even though your physical hand goes through,

492
00:28:52,835 --> 00:28:57,256
The glove stays there and it feels okay because you don't want to go farther

493
00:28:57,256 --> 00:29:03,078
You just got like a response from the world and say okay. You're solid. I won't I won't push you and

494
00:29:03,078 --> 00:29:12,382
it's nice also to put things in your field where you need to avoid them because you naturally tend to avoid things and

495
00:29:12,382 --> 00:29:13,522
when you're like

496
00:29:13,522 --> 00:29:18,104
Physically doing things like that it feels real like you see like a big rock here

497
00:29:18,104 --> 00:29:21,125
And you try to avoid it even though you could perfectly put your head through it

498
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,592
and get the clipping and everything,

499
00:29:23,592 --> 00:29:25,354
then most people just never do that.

500
00:29:25,354 --> 00:29:25,974
Then there's a sense of scale,

501
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:28,937
and that was really the most difficult for Everest,

502
00:29:28,937 --> 00:29:34,442
because Everest you need to have that sense of scale,

503
00:29:34,442 --> 00:29:37,685
but even in real life it's sometimes difficult

504
00:29:37,685 --> 00:29:39,947
to get a sense of scale of mountains.

505
00:29:41,515 --> 00:29:43,957
So you have to use familiar objects,

506
00:29:43,957 --> 00:29:46,919
so in this case, in our case, it's mostly people, climbers.

507
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:50,221
You have to put them somewhere at different ranges

508
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:52,563
so you can see how the landscape is changing.

509
00:29:52,563 --> 00:29:55,165
The establishing shots also help

510
00:29:55,165 --> 00:29:58,228
because then you have memories of certain pieces

511
00:29:58,228 --> 00:30:00,309
that you're now looking at closer

512
00:30:00,309 --> 00:30:03,872
and you realize the scale of things.

513
00:30:03,872 --> 00:30:07,155
And you can also make it with sound, obviously, and light.

514
00:30:07,823 --> 00:30:11,805
and things that fall, for example.

515
00:30:11,805 --> 00:30:16,228
If something falls, you can see it,

516
00:30:16,228 --> 00:30:18,349
and then you see the scale reducing,

517
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:20,130
and you realize how steep a slope is, or how big it is.

518
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:23,592
And the vertigo was also interesting.

519
00:30:23,592 --> 00:30:27,514
There are all kinds of ranges of vertigo, apparently.

520
00:30:27,514 --> 00:30:30,536
And, for example, the vertigo that was the worst for us

521
00:30:30,536 --> 00:30:33,478
was when we were just doing early blockouts,

522
00:30:33,478 --> 00:30:35,379
just using cubes, not real models.

523
00:30:36,257 --> 00:30:42,003
When you have sharp edges that you're walking on, like on a cube, it's absolutely terrifying.

524
00:30:42,003 --> 00:30:47,608
It's like your brain tells you that you have absolutely no chance, when it's just like a sharp edge.

525
00:30:48,529 --> 00:30:52,231
As soon as we put like the real model of snow and ice,

526
00:30:52,231 --> 00:30:54,092
it's like your brain is telling you like,

527
00:30:54,092 --> 00:30:57,015
yeah, I might grab that stone on the way when I'm falling.

528
00:30:57,015 --> 00:30:59,296
And you know, so it's like it says, you know,

529
00:30:59,296 --> 00:31:01,057
it's not that bad.

530
00:31:01,057 --> 00:31:03,739
So we actually had to change a little bit reality

531
00:31:03,739 --> 00:31:07,442
in this case to pull your brain and tell you yes it is.

532
00:31:07,442 --> 00:31:09,363
And other things that are interesting

533
00:31:09,363 --> 00:31:11,345
is also the length of things.

534
00:31:11,345 --> 00:31:14,347
So for example, we have a scene

535
00:31:14,347 --> 00:31:17,189
where you cross a crevice on ladder.

536
00:31:18,161 --> 00:31:24,026
And if the ladder was very long, then the sense of vertigo was very much increased.

537
00:31:24,026 --> 00:31:26,408
It was shorter, it was reduced.

538
00:31:26,408 --> 00:31:31,593
And I think it was just the brain telling you, like, if I have to cross this, I will

539
00:31:31,593 --> 00:31:33,635
feel bad for a long time.

540
00:31:33,635 --> 00:31:38,039
But if it's short, I will only feel bad for like a few seconds and it will be okay.

541
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:41,862
So that's one way of scaling the vertigo effect, actually.

542
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:50,063
And then there's this thing that I find the most intriguing.

543
00:31:50,063 --> 00:31:58,710
It's the way the brain actually at some points, when the brain decides that you have reality,

544
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:01,172
it has accepted the reality contract.

545
00:32:01,901 --> 00:32:07,143
it starts patching things up for you. So you as a content developer, you don't need to do

546
00:32:07,143 --> 00:32:14,546
anything anymore. And I had a friend that went through one of our demos, and he was describing

547
00:32:14,546 --> 00:32:20,669
the experience to me afterwards. And he was telling me he was looking down on the ledge, and

548
00:32:20,669 --> 00:32:26,591
he was looking at his boots, his yellow boots, and I told him, we don't have boots in the game.

549
00:32:26,591 --> 00:32:31,293
His yellow boot doesn't exist. And the fact is, is that...

550
00:32:32,836 --> 00:32:37,199
We actually, we cannot put like feet on our model

551
00:32:37,199 --> 00:32:38,820
because there's no tracking.

552
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,862
And it will be very strange if you have like,

553
00:32:41,862 --> 00:32:43,923
for example, footprints coming out

554
00:32:43,923 --> 00:32:46,946
that are not where your feet are.

555
00:32:46,946 --> 00:32:48,207
So we avoid that.

556
00:32:48,207 --> 00:32:52,470
But what we did instead is that we took the acceleration

557
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,572
of your head and used that to trigger a...

558
00:32:57,001 --> 00:32:59,463
snow crunch effects or sound effects.

559
00:32:59,463 --> 00:33:01,284
So, coming from here.

560
00:33:01,284 --> 00:33:04,226
So when you move a little bit, you hear like,

561
00:33:04,226 --> 00:33:06,467
and it sort of follows what you would expect

562
00:33:06,467 --> 00:33:08,088
when you're walking.

563
00:33:08,088 --> 00:33:10,310
And that seemed to be enough to like,

564
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,310
okay, I'm standing there.

565
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,672
I'm on snow, I can hear the snow.

566
00:33:13,672 --> 00:33:17,935
And that's how probably he ended up seeing those boots

567
00:33:17,935 --> 00:33:21,377
because his brain has just decided that this was all real.

568
00:33:21,377 --> 00:33:21,897
Another thing is shadow.

569
00:33:26,152 --> 00:33:29,394
Because you don't have a body in this kind of VR experience.

570
00:33:29,394 --> 00:33:32,636
Usually you just have these hands.

571
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:34,537
Then it's kind of weird you don't have a shadow.

572
00:33:34,537 --> 00:33:36,758
But we found that shadows actually

573
00:33:36,758 --> 00:33:40,181
help a lot in providing a sense of immersion.

574
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,783
it sort of like projects you somewhere.

575
00:33:44,783 --> 00:33:47,065
And it also gives a good sense of scale

576
00:33:47,065 --> 00:33:48,986
because your shadow can extend for a long time.

577
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:51,388
But the problem is that you don't have an avatar,

578
00:33:51,388 --> 00:33:52,589
so we can't really cast a shadow.

579
00:33:52,589 --> 00:33:55,111
But we've experimented both,

580
00:33:55,111 --> 00:33:57,874
we cast shadow from the gloves, and that is helpful.

581
00:33:57,874 --> 00:34:00,556
And we would also put like very simple...

582
00:34:01,322 --> 00:34:05,845
volumes like just a cylinder and even that is enough because your brain is just...

583
00:34:05,845 --> 00:34:09,608
see it's like it's a shadow that moves with me it's sort of like

584
00:34:09,608 --> 00:34:13,190
it is me and I don't really care if it's not actually me or

585
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:18,294
looks like a body it's just a shadow and it doesn't need to have very sharp

586
00:34:18,294 --> 00:34:21,756
edges and such but it makes the things much more

587
00:34:21,756 --> 00:34:25,078
physical when you see it and it makes you also feel more physical

588
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:38,016
And then there's also things which are probably things that are already well familiar from movies and such,

589
00:34:38,016 --> 00:34:44,981
but controlling physiological factors subtly is very efficient.

590
00:34:44,981 --> 00:34:47,923
So we do have like heartbeat tracks in the audio.

591
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:54,041
that we can sort of like, we can like pump them up at some certain places

592
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:59,103
and people tend to empathize with heartbeats so you can sort of like

593
00:34:59,103 --> 00:35:02,884
increase people's stress level just with a heartbeat and we also have a

594
00:35:02,884 --> 00:35:07,665
breathing track and and that's the same thing people empathize a lot with

595
00:35:07,665 --> 00:35:11,666
breathing like if you have like a shallow breathing sound you start to

596
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:13,767
feel like you're out of air yourself

597
00:35:14,853 --> 00:35:18,495
So that helps us in recreating the right emotions and feelings,

598
00:35:18,495 --> 00:35:20,116
depending on the scenes that we have.

599
00:35:20,116 --> 00:35:22,538
So for example, in the Everest, you

600
00:35:22,538 --> 00:35:26,721
do go above a level where you will

601
00:35:26,721 --> 00:35:29,723
feel the effect of oxygen deficiency,

602
00:35:29,723 --> 00:35:32,344
even though you have an oxygen tank.

603
00:35:32,344 --> 00:35:38,748
And it's good to be able to recreate that aspect using

604
00:35:38,748 --> 00:35:39,749
these techniques.

605
00:35:40,831 --> 00:35:46,834
And another thing that we are also experimenting with is controlling your movement.

606
00:35:46,834 --> 00:35:52,357
Because also when you're up in a death zone or up a hill or step or even to the summit,

607
00:35:52,357 --> 00:35:57,960
again because of the altitude, you tend to move very slowly in real life.

608
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,061
So you don't rush through things.

609
00:36:01,483 --> 00:36:06,204
And there's nothing in VR that prohibits the user to just run

610
00:36:06,204 --> 00:36:07,785
through the whole experience.

611
00:36:07,785 --> 00:36:09,785
So we experiment a little bit with,

612
00:36:09,785 --> 00:36:13,926
like, if you go too fast to start blacking out.

613
00:36:13,926 --> 00:36:15,507
And after a while, you realize, OK,

614
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,047
if I want to go through this experience,

615
00:36:17,047 --> 00:36:17,908
I need to go slowly.

616
00:36:17,908 --> 00:36:21,849
And in that way, you're sort of conditioning the user

617
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:25,630
to a point where he becomes more immersed in the situation.

618
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:28,571
And I think that's interesting things to do as well.

619
00:36:28,571 --> 00:36:31,192
All these little brain hacks.

620
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,761
Another thing that we found is that the wind makes you cold.

621
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:40,242
A lot of people complain about being cold after the experience, which kind of makes

622
00:36:40,242 --> 00:36:46,664
sense when you have snow all around you and wind and particle effects swirling around

623
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:47,464
you.

624
00:36:47,464 --> 00:36:49,465
And we also want to have the breathing when you...

625
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:53,356
when you like breathe out of your air.

626
00:36:53,356 --> 00:36:57,037
And that's also a very efficient reality cue

627
00:36:57,037 --> 00:36:59,558
to tell you that you're there.

628
00:36:59,558 --> 00:37:04,100
What I'm doing now is breathing out,

629
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,741
and it is in this world.

630
00:37:05,741 --> 00:37:06,621
So that's kind of a cool thing to add as well.

631
00:37:06,621 --> 00:37:12,544
And that's all the slides I have.

632
00:37:12,544 --> 00:37:16,166
So I was just wondering if we want to go to Q&A.

633
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:16,806
That's like a, I think.

634
00:37:16,806 --> 00:37:17,046
It's cool.

635
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:37,607
I think there's an open mic there if somebody wants to...

636
00:37:44,957 --> 00:37:49,638
Hi. Just a quick question. You said that you disabled depth of

637
00:37:49,638 --> 00:37:53,519
field in your passes. Now, when you're playing, I haven't had a

638
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:57,459
chance to try the Everest demo, but without depth of field, do

639
00:37:57,459 --> 00:38:02,060
you find that anybody, like, you don't feel it as real as it

640
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,961
should be? Because obviously you have natural depth of field

641
00:38:03,961 --> 00:38:07,781
with your real vision without it being present in the demo. Is

642
00:38:07,781 --> 00:38:08,801
there like a disconnect there?

643
00:38:08,801 --> 00:38:09,222
Well, it depends. From

644
00:38:14,975 --> 00:38:17,383
From my experience, you as a real person,

645
00:38:17,383 --> 00:38:19,691
you don't really experience depth of field.

646
00:38:21,022 --> 00:38:24,584
because usually your eyes are always adapting.

647
00:38:24,584 --> 00:38:24,764
Yeah, yeah.

648
00:38:24,764 --> 00:38:27,626
So it's more like a movie trick where people use that

649
00:38:27,626 --> 00:38:31,408
to sort of change the plane of interest.

650
00:38:31,408 --> 00:38:33,690
But in our case, first, of course,

651
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,931
the panorama is often very far away,

652
00:38:35,931 --> 00:38:38,432
so there is really not so much depth of field.

653
00:38:38,432 --> 00:38:41,174
And then we do have some atmospheric fog

654
00:38:41,174 --> 00:38:44,356
that sort of simulates the effect of distance,

655
00:38:44,356 --> 00:38:46,637
and I guess maybe that sort of works

656
00:38:46,637 --> 00:38:48,719
in a similar way as depth of field.

657
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:49,579
Okay, cool, thank you.

658
00:39:10,122 --> 00:39:12,224
How big is the room going to be, please?

659
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:16,827
How large a room do you need for the experience?

660
00:39:16,827 --> 00:39:24,773
So we've just been following the recommended min specs that have been issued by the device

661
00:39:24,773 --> 00:39:25,413
manufacturers.

662
00:39:25,413 --> 00:39:32,418
I think it's like for the Vive it's like 2 by 2 meters nearly.

663
00:39:32,418 --> 00:39:37,302
And for Rift it's slightly smaller, like 2 times 1.5 for a standard experience.

664
00:39:42,363 --> 00:39:46,206
We also tried experimenting with actually scaling the content,

665
00:39:46,206 --> 00:39:49,029
depending on the room, to try to make the most of it.

666
00:39:49,029 --> 00:39:51,251
But it's kind of difficult to do that.

667
00:39:51,251 --> 00:39:53,193
So if you had a crevice, we could actually

668
00:39:53,193 --> 00:39:55,775
move, shift it a little bit.

669
00:39:55,775 --> 00:39:59,618
But as we use pre-computed lighting,

670
00:39:59,618 --> 00:40:03,161
it's not easy to do, to have such a dynamic scene.

671
00:40:05,104 --> 00:40:09,772
I'm wondering, you talked about having breathing effects when they breathe as well as like

672
00:40:09,772 --> 00:40:11,254
a breathing track.

673
00:40:11,254 --> 00:40:15,421
How do you deal with that, like not being in sync with their actual breathing?

674
00:40:15,421 --> 00:40:17,644
So there is a microphone that you can use.

675
00:40:18,824 --> 00:40:22,628
So it would be in sync with their actual breathing then?

676
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:23,049
Sorry?

677
00:40:23,049 --> 00:40:24,050
So it can be in sync?

678
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:24,871
Yeah, it can be in sync.

679
00:40:24,871 --> 00:40:30,217
The only problem is that you want to maybe filter it quite heavily because of course

680
00:40:30,217 --> 00:40:32,640
you can't really control what goes into that microphone.

681
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,324
You know, people may be banging their fingers on it.

682
00:40:37,027 --> 00:40:38,508
But you can sort of cue it.

683
00:40:38,508 --> 00:40:41,590
I think also head motions can help.

684
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:44,612
There are subtle motions that you do with your head

685
00:40:44,612 --> 00:40:46,753
when you breathe.

686
00:40:46,753 --> 00:40:49,635
But it doesn't need to be very enforced.

687
00:40:49,635 --> 00:40:54,337
It's just like a very wispy kind of particle effect

688
00:40:54,337 --> 00:40:56,779
is kind of enough to feel that there's air

689
00:40:56,779 --> 00:40:57,799
coming out of you.

690
00:40:57,799 --> 00:40:58,400
Cool, thank you.

691
00:41:04,203 --> 00:41:05,824
Just a quick question.

692
00:41:05,824 --> 00:41:10,106
I'm wondering whether you could share

693
00:41:10,106 --> 00:41:12,786
the total ballpark of the cost that went into production?

694
00:41:12,786 --> 00:41:13,127
The cost?

695
00:41:13,127 --> 00:41:14,687
Yeah.

696
00:41:14,687 --> 00:41:19,709
I can share with you the info that we've,

697
00:41:19,709 --> 00:41:22,910
it's about 10 persons for six months.

698
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:23,910
What about other materials?

699
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:26,051
If you own a helicopter, it's a little cheaper.

700
00:41:26,051 --> 00:41:26,531
Sorry?

701
00:41:26,531 --> 00:41:31,053
If you own a helicopter, it's a little cheaper.

702
00:41:31,855 --> 00:41:40,911
That's of course in the acquisition of the pictures and all that, which is a fixed cost for our internal production budgets.
