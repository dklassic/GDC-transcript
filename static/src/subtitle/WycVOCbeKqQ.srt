1
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:08,915
It's not so warm because apparently I brought the weather with me.

2
00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:11,678
So I apologize for bringing the depressing weather.

3
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:13,140
And also some numbers.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,862
So here's the thing.

5
00:00:18,948 --> 00:00:27,130
In February, around 850 games launched on Steam, which is about 40 a day, and about

6
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,391
82% of those didn't even make minimum wage.

7
00:00:30,751 --> 00:00:35,692
Now later in the talk I'm going to explain where these numbers are coming from, but by

8
00:00:35,732 --> 00:00:41,633
this I mean that a singular person, the money that came out of 82% of the games that came

9
00:00:41,713 --> 00:00:47,355
out on Steam would not support a singular person on American minimum wage, which I had

10
00:00:47,395 --> 00:00:47,835
to Google.

11
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:57,679
And of every other game, 7% of those games that launched on Steam actually made enough

12
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,640
money that the studio would survive.

13
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:06,743
Again, this surviving thing is kind of my opinion of how much money you would need to

14
00:01:06,803 --> 00:01:12,705
survive, but yeah, roughly about 7% could actually go on and make another game.

15
00:01:14,558 --> 00:01:16,841
So anyway, hello, I am Mike.

16
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:20,765
I have been writing about games for a very long time.

17
00:01:21,245 --> 00:01:27,672
If you know me already, you maybe know me from when I was at IndieGames.com many moons

18
00:01:27,732 --> 00:01:31,636
ago, Gamasutra, and other places.

19
00:01:31,876 --> 00:01:35,179
I then joined publisher TinyBuild several years ago.

20
00:01:35,199 --> 00:01:36,801
We did a bunch of cool stuff.

21
00:01:37,582 --> 00:01:40,883
And then last year, because I'm an egotistical maniac,

22
00:01:40,943 --> 00:01:43,284
I decided I had to start my own publishing label

23
00:01:44,024 --> 00:01:45,945
because I need to control everything.

24
00:01:46,705 --> 00:01:50,566
And that has been going all right, actually.

25
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:51,647
Thank you very much for asking.

26
00:01:52,227 --> 00:01:55,848
We released Descenders last month.

27
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:58,369
The developers, RageSquid, indeed, woo!

28
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,591
They made Action Henk before, which was an incredible game.

29
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:07,316
And then they stepped it up for Descenders, made a downhill mountain biking game,

30
00:02:07,917 --> 00:02:09,719
and it has done pretty well for us.

31
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:12,983
It's made more money in the first month

32
00:02:14,165 --> 00:02:17,630
than Rage Squid made in the lifetime of Action Hank.

33
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:24,058
So, I'm obviously a marketing genius, but it's been really good.

34
00:02:24,078 --> 00:02:30,339
It means that all of us, we can all continue to publish slash develop games for a while

35
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:30,519
now.

36
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,861
And I have other games, I've just not announced them yet, because I like to keep things close

37
00:02:36,881 --> 00:02:41,101
to my chest, so we're actually announcing the second No More Robots game next week,

38
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:43,402
and maybe if you're polite I'll show it to you.

39
00:02:45,483 --> 00:02:49,175
So yeah, as you probably knew going into this talk,

40
00:02:49,616 --> 00:02:50,559
I don't know why you're here.

41
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,462
This is gonna be horrible.

42
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,066
I'm gonna just give you loads of numbers now.

43
00:02:56,047 --> 00:02:58,228
Some of them are going to be more meaningful than others.

44
00:02:58,268 --> 00:02:59,689
I'll say that straight up front now.

45
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,471
I'm giving you all the numbers

46
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:03,512
so that you can then decide afterwards,

47
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,153
well, I think those ones were bull

48
00:03:05,534 --> 00:03:06,314
and all this kind of stuff.

49
00:03:06,374 --> 00:03:08,376
But I felt like if I gave you everything,

50
00:03:09,316 --> 00:03:10,117
then it might help.

51
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:12,078
So I'm gonna tell you what the average game

52
00:03:12,138 --> 00:03:13,159
is selling on Steam now,

53
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,022
how much money you can actually hope to make,

54
00:03:17,342 --> 00:03:19,764
because obviously the average game on Steam

55
00:03:21,265 --> 00:03:27,751
is cack. Whether being in early access does anything, whether having a publisher does

56
00:03:27,811 --> 00:03:32,134
anything, whether pricing your game, like the price that you choose for your game makes

57
00:03:32,175 --> 00:03:36,658
any difference, and whether there are certain genres that just seem to sell better, in case

58
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:37,800
you want to try and do that.

59
00:03:38,967 --> 00:03:42,509
So, before I start showing numbers, this is the reason why I need to give this talk.

60
00:03:42,529 --> 00:03:48,273
This is a genuine email that I've received, and I receive emails like this all the time.

61
00:03:49,093 --> 00:03:53,396
The problem is that games aren't selling on Steam anymore.

62
00:03:53,616 --> 00:03:59,080
I mean, not on many platforms, but specifically Steam, but a lot of developers still think

63
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,480
they are.

64
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,902
And that's kind of because developers are looking at these three things here.

65
00:04:04,922 --> 00:04:09,003
A lot of people are coming to me saying things like,

66
00:04:09,543 --> 00:04:11,483
oh well, our game's a bit like Limbo,

67
00:04:11,663 --> 00:04:15,104
and Limbo sold millions of copies, so my game will as well.

68
00:04:16,064 --> 00:04:17,425
Oh, God, that's not how it works.

69
00:04:17,745 --> 00:04:20,506
But I get that all the time, genuinely, weekly.

70
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:24,067
I get people talking about games that came out two years ago.

71
00:04:25,507 --> 00:04:27,127
Even games that came out one year ago,

72
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,988
you can't even use them for comparison anymore.

73
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:32,969
Because a lot has happened in the last year, right?

74
00:04:33,349 --> 00:04:35,550
Video games are all over the place.

75
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,611
Especially with Steam Direct opening up.

76
00:04:40,431 --> 00:04:41,852
Anyone can put a game on Steam now.

77
00:04:42,752 --> 00:04:45,833
And you can't rely on just being on Steam

78
00:04:45,913 --> 00:04:46,533
to sell your game.

79
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:47,493
A year ago you couldn't.

80
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:52,355
Now you are, you're gonna not do well if you're doing that.

81
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,395
And I really need to drill this home

82
00:04:54,455 --> 00:04:56,096
because a lot of people do not listen.

83
00:04:58,434 --> 00:05:00,796
So I'm going to show you numbers now.

84
00:05:01,937 --> 00:05:04,019
So all of these numbers are estimates.

85
00:05:04,219 --> 00:05:07,001
I don't have some magic backdoor to Steam, OK?

86
00:05:07,942 --> 00:05:10,644
However, I have been doing this for a while.

87
00:05:10,704 --> 00:05:12,906
Even back from when I was writing about games,

88
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:17,690
I was working out sales figures, et cetera.

89
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,812
In fact, if you were here three years ago,

90
00:05:19,872 --> 00:05:22,354
I gave a talk about sales figures across all platforms.

91
00:05:24,236 --> 00:05:29,203
And that was, as far as I understand, pretty close to the right numbers.

92
00:05:29,283 --> 00:05:31,025
So, I've been doing this for a while.

93
00:05:31,045 --> 00:05:34,810
I think these numbers are pretty spot on.

94
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:38,415
Let's just do it, shall we?

95
00:05:40,028 --> 00:05:44,809
So a year ago, a year ago, this is kind of how games were selling.

96
00:05:44,829 --> 00:05:46,050
And it was bad a year ago.

97
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,030
It wasn't good.

98
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:53,292
On average, games that were coming out on Steam round about February to March in 2017

99
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:58,014
were selling about 500 copies and making about $2,000 in their first month.

100
00:06:01,991 --> 00:06:08,359
And I include the average price there as well because I think the price is going to be an interesting thing.

101
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:14,967
Maybe you want to take some things away from how much people are pricing their games at

102
00:06:15,107 --> 00:06:17,270
and how much money they actually get out of that.

103
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:27,430
This is now, so this is me taking every single game that came out on Steam in February,

104
00:06:27,931 --> 00:06:34,339
working out pretty close estimates for how much they made.

105
00:06:34,739 --> 00:06:36,482
I'll say that I've been optimistic.

106
00:06:38,685 --> 00:06:44,534
I would say there's a lot of games that sold zero copies, but I can't prove if they sold

107
00:06:44,574 --> 00:06:48,299
zero copies or not, because it's a difficult thing to check.

108
00:06:50,063 --> 00:06:54,225
On average, the average game on Steam now is selling about 50 copies in its first month

109
00:06:54,685 --> 00:06:56,646
and making about $250 in revenue.

110
00:06:56,746 --> 00:07:01,228
I'm using all the medians here because there's also some big launches, right?

111
00:07:01,268 --> 00:07:03,309
That's not to say there aren't massive games that come out.

112
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:07,471
It's just that they are a very small piece of the pie, really.

113
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,212
The average price is $5.

114
00:07:11,903 --> 00:07:13,764
which I think is just ridiculous.

115
00:07:15,425 --> 00:07:20,989
But yeah, basically Steam is very rapidly

116
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,111
just becoming like the App Store before it and everything.

117
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:27,613
And it means that you haven't been able to rely

118
00:07:28,334 --> 00:07:30,535
on Steam to sell your game for a while now,

119
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,316
but now especially, please, though,

120
00:07:32,677 --> 00:07:34,718
I see a lot of new developers coming in and thinking,

121
00:07:34,758 --> 00:07:36,759
if I put my game on Steam, people will just buy it.

122
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,040
It's not gonna happen.

123
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,841
Being on Steam means nothing now.

124
00:07:41,102 --> 00:07:43,504
It hasn't for a while and now it does not at all.

125
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:48,268
So yeah, Steam Direct launched last summer.

126
00:07:48,308 --> 00:07:52,832
It means anyone can pay $100 to put their game on Steam.

127
00:07:53,232 --> 00:07:56,355
We're getting nearly 900 games.

128
00:07:56,515 --> 00:07:59,457
I imagine it's going to break 1,000 games a month soon.

129
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:04,121
So on the day, like we launched Ascenders last month.

130
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:07,762
I think there were like 45 games that came out that day.

131
00:08:08,582 --> 00:08:13,204
And not even small ones, there was a couple of other games which were big names.

132
00:08:15,185 --> 00:08:17,386
So it's a problem.

133
00:08:17,946 --> 00:08:25,570
So yeah, this is horrible, but I'm sure a lot of you right now are sitting thinking,

134
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,671
yeah, but they're all crap though, aren't they?

135
00:08:29,284 --> 00:08:32,406
and I'm not going to put out a crap game.

136
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,407
And you know what, you are right.

137
00:08:35,668 --> 00:08:37,850
A vast majority of these games

138
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:40,751
that I'm using to put these numbers together

139
00:08:40,772 --> 00:08:45,014
are just Unity Store asset flips

140
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,696
or just rubbish.

141
00:08:48,076 --> 00:08:51,098
I think the day the Descendants came out

142
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,679
I worked out that like

143
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:55,881
about 35 out of the 45 games that came out

144
00:08:56,702 --> 00:09:01,445
One of them was like a clone of, you remember that helicopter game where you hold the space bar?

145
00:09:01,905 --> 00:09:03,346
And made the helicopter go like that.

146
00:09:03,366 --> 00:09:04,186
Um...

147
00:09:05,027 --> 00:09:06,988
You're not competing with MRE, let's be honest.

148
00:09:07,008 --> 00:09:08,309
You're not competing with those games.

149
00:09:08,629 --> 00:09:11,991
So those numbers I just showed you, remove them from your brain immediately.

150
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:13,372
I don't even know why I showed them to you.

151
00:09:13,912 --> 00:09:15,674
Um, let's look at some proper ones.

152
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:19,236
Now this is incredibly objective because this is, uh...

153
00:09:19,316 --> 00:09:20,016
Is that the right word?

154
00:09:20,397 --> 00:09:23,218
This is me removing the crap.

155
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,464
Your idea of crap might be different to mine, so maybe these numbers will look slightly different to yours.

156
00:09:29,804 --> 00:09:37,131
This is when I am trying to decide how my games are going to sell, I am using these numbers right here.

157
00:09:37,871 --> 00:09:45,358
So these, once I have taken that over average, and then I have removed all the games that I think were never going to sell in the first place,

158
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,302
and only left the ones that I think have a shot of doing well.

159
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,580
It looks a bit better.

160
00:09:53,621 --> 00:09:56,823
2,000 copies on average in the first month.

161
00:09:56,943 --> 00:09:57,784
12,500 in revenue.

162
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:00,826
And you see that average price is like double now.

163
00:10:01,026 --> 00:10:01,786
The average price is $12.

164
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,688
Again, I'm going to talk a little bit more about this

165
00:10:05,728 --> 00:10:08,730
later, but I think price is important.

166
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:12,532
And anybody who stupidly follows me on Twitter knows

167
00:10:12,552 --> 00:10:15,314
that every now and again I'll go off about people pricing

168
00:10:15,354 --> 00:10:16,175
their games too low.

169
00:10:18,102 --> 00:10:18,862
Let me get to that.

170
00:10:19,142 --> 00:10:24,683
So this guy, Jake, he's been doing some interesting,

171
00:10:24,723 --> 00:10:25,884
cool stuff, he's British as well.

172
00:10:25,904 --> 00:10:28,965
I don't know why I had to tell you that.

173
00:10:29,925 --> 00:10:31,645
And he has essentially worked out

174
00:10:31,685 --> 00:10:33,406
this incredibly rough formula.

175
00:10:33,426 --> 00:10:35,826
I say it's incredibly rough,

176
00:10:35,847 --> 00:10:38,367
but it's matched Descenders perfectly up to now,

177
00:10:38,407 --> 00:10:40,168
and a bunch of other people I've talked to as well

178
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,668
have said it's matched them pretty well.

179
00:10:42,168 --> 00:10:44,549
So essentially, you take your first week of sales,

180
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:49,171
times that by two and you get roughly your first month,

181
00:10:49,331 --> 00:10:51,652
times it by five and you get roughly your first year.

182
00:10:53,813 --> 00:10:57,214
So again, this is an even super rougher estimate

183
00:10:57,234 --> 00:10:58,254
than things I've been giving you.

184
00:10:59,415 --> 00:11:02,676
But taking my numbers and using his formula,

185
00:11:02,716 --> 00:11:07,238
you're looking at about $30,000 in revenue on average

186
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:09,519
for the first year.

187
00:11:11,993 --> 00:11:16,617
So, then what I've done is I've gone through, I've been, I've not just been taking how much

188
00:11:16,657 --> 00:11:22,862
games sell and how much revenue they make, I've been then just pulling together all information

189
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:26,004
about what kind of games they are, whether they're an early access, etc.

190
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:29,654
Early Access is just a funny one.

191
00:11:30,235 --> 00:11:31,896
We did Early Access with Descenders.

192
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:38,319
And I think for a while now, the perception of Early Access,

193
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,121
I think sometimes we get a little bit worried

194
00:11:41,161 --> 00:11:43,442
that people aren't going to buy it because it's in Early Access

195
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,243
and it will put them off.

196
00:11:46,284 --> 00:11:49,065
From what I can see, it's just not true at all.

197
00:11:49,105 --> 00:11:51,607
It seems like, if anything, sometimes a lot

198
00:11:51,647 --> 00:11:54,889
of the biggest releases in February were Early Access

199
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:55,229
games.

200
00:11:56,929 --> 00:12:03,512
People, a lot of players are used to being involved in the development of games now and

201
00:12:03,552 --> 00:12:07,113
actually find it a bit of a turn on when a game is early access.

202
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:13,936
So the numbers aren't that much bigger, but you can see if anybody has been worrying about

203
00:12:13,976 --> 00:12:17,837
putting their game in early access and thinking, what if no one wants to buy it, I don't think

204
00:12:17,857 --> 00:12:18,878
that's the case at all.

205
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,878
And I don't think you should worry about that kind of thing.

206
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,061
Does having a publisher help?

207
00:12:25,701 --> 00:12:29,203
So, the answer seems to be yes.

208
00:12:30,823 --> 00:12:31,843
It's a tricky one, right?

209
00:12:31,923 --> 00:12:34,524
Because it depends as well on so many factors.

210
00:12:34,584 --> 00:12:36,725
It depends on the kind of deal you get with the publisher.

211
00:12:37,805 --> 00:12:40,867
Being a publisher myself, I know what some of those deals look like.

212
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:46,910
So the numbers are higher, the numbers are making five times as much money,

213
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,971
but of course then the publisher's taking their cut,

214
00:12:49,671 --> 00:12:51,072
and I don't know what else they're taking.

215
00:12:51,873 --> 00:12:52,513
Your dignity.

216
00:12:53,393 --> 00:12:56,255
But you've got to keep that in mind, right?

217
00:12:56,275 --> 00:13:00,878
And you'll see as well, the publishers on average price their games higher as well.

218
00:13:02,018 --> 00:13:03,879
I keep going on about price, so let's talk about it.

219
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:10,423
When we were launching Descenders and we were talking about the price of it, Rage Squid

220
00:13:10,663 --> 00:13:12,484
was scared to go with a higher price.

221
00:13:12,965 --> 00:13:18,008
And I don't blame them because it looks like, when you look at the price of games, it looks

222
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:21,149
like you players aren't buying games that are higher prices.

223
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:29,595
I did a horrible publisher thing and thought, no I didn't, I just talked them into a higher price.

224
00:13:29,915 --> 00:13:37,703
We launched it for $25, and that higher price point has honestly done incredible things for the game.

225
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:43,389
Now, that's not to say that that translates perfectly to your game, I'm not saying...

226
00:13:43,909 --> 00:13:46,791
I'd just knock it up by $5. That's not how it works.

227
00:13:47,311 --> 00:13:52,595
If your game is worth $15, then it's worth $15.

228
00:13:54,356 --> 00:13:59,679
All I would say to you is that people are paying more for games.

229
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:00,940
They are. They absolutely are.

230
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,723
And I honestly, sometimes when I talk to people in our community, for example,

231
00:14:06,183 --> 00:14:07,384
a lot of players will say that...

232
00:14:08,145 --> 00:14:11,126
when they're looking at all the games that are coming out on Steam that day,

233
00:14:11,427 --> 00:14:13,928
the ones that are higher priced will actually jump out at them

234
00:14:14,268 --> 00:14:18,510
because they're like, well, why do they think they can charge more than everybody else?

235
00:14:19,451 --> 00:14:21,152
So, in a really weird way,

236
00:14:21,172 --> 00:14:25,314
if your game, if you think, you know what, my game might be worth

237
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:27,655
more than I'm giving it credit for.

238
00:14:29,522 --> 00:14:30,723
It makes such a big difference.

239
00:14:30,763 --> 00:14:33,925
Because as well, down the line, you know, when it comes to sales,

240
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,627
when we eventually, far, far, far down the line,

241
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,508
do a half-price sale for Descenders now,

242
00:14:39,148 --> 00:14:43,171
it's basically like a full-price launch for the average game on Steam.

243
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,255
which is amazing for us.

244
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:51,616
But yeah, this is one of those situations where

245
00:14:52,136 --> 00:14:55,457
maybe you know what your game should be priced

246
00:14:55,857 --> 00:14:57,958
but do have a think about it.

247
00:14:58,018 --> 00:15:00,979
I really urge you to because I talk to developers all the time

248
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:03,679
who are just pricing themselves lower

249
00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:05,300
and it makes a massive difference, you know.

250
00:15:07,001 --> 00:15:11,262
I did one of these word clouds. I've not done one of these in years and I thought it might be funny.

251
00:15:11,622 --> 00:15:16,663
So I took all the genres of the top 100 games and turned them into one of these word cloud things.

252
00:15:17,043 --> 00:15:22,484
I mean, survival and crafting are big, did you know? I couldn't believe it.

253
00:15:23,885 --> 00:15:27,506
And shooters, who would have thought? I like that bikes was there.

254
00:15:27,786 --> 00:15:30,666
I feel like I was doing one for the team.

255
00:15:30,866 --> 00:15:34,827
I mean, there was a couple of other bike games that came out as well, but ours was best.

256
00:15:36,028 --> 00:15:39,610
And then there's a few smaller ones as well, which were interesting.

257
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,812
Visual novels do pretty well.

258
00:15:42,472 --> 00:15:45,695
I don't know how many of you play that many visual novels and stuff, but

259
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:48,296
visual novels rarely explode,

260
00:15:48,897 --> 00:15:53,260
but they, a lot of the time, do pretty darn well.

261
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,882
So, yeah, it's...

262
00:15:56,962 --> 00:15:59,724
This is probably the least useful slide in the whole thing, don't worry, but

263
00:16:00,185 --> 00:16:02,586
I just thought it was pretty, so I don't care.

264
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,344
Right, I talked really fast and showed you a bunch of numbers.

265
00:16:08,045 --> 00:16:09,607
So here's a bit of a recap.

266
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:16,414
About 93% of people who are releasing games on Steam

267
00:16:16,454 --> 00:16:19,478
right now, they don't make enough money

268
00:16:19,798 --> 00:16:21,260
that after they've released that game,

269
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,722
they can go make another money.

270
00:16:23,222 --> 00:16:23,663
Another money?

271
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:24,704
Another game.

272
00:16:26,506 --> 00:16:34,677
And I mean, of course, you got to be, you know, I'm sure a lot of people are doing it while also having a full-time job or whatever.

273
00:16:34,717 --> 00:16:40,745
So that's not taking that into consideration. This is, I'm talking doing games full-time.

274
00:16:41,746 --> 00:16:43,228
So ignore me if you're not one of those people.

275
00:16:44,518 --> 00:16:48,740
But the average PC game, even after you cut out all the crap,

276
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,882
is making about $30,000 in the first year.

277
00:16:53,942 --> 00:16:59,765
What you should take away from that is that you should have a plan, basically.

278
00:17:00,065 --> 00:17:01,026
You need to have a plan.

279
00:17:02,727 --> 00:17:07,649
Myself and RageSquid, we planned for what if no one cares about mountain biking.

280
00:17:07,749 --> 00:17:09,490
There was every chance no one was going to care.

281
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,851
So we planned what happens if this game tanks.

282
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:16,333
and we had backup plans for what we were going to do.

283
00:17:17,513 --> 00:17:18,754
You need to have one of those,

284
00:17:19,034 --> 00:17:22,956
because you don't want to get caught in a horrible situation

285
00:17:22,976 --> 00:17:23,976
where you release your game,

286
00:17:26,037 --> 00:17:27,918
it doesn't do as well as you were hoping,

287
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:29,538
you feel like crap,

288
00:17:29,658 --> 00:17:30,639
because everybody does.

289
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:32,700
Even if your game does well, you feel like crap, right?

290
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,121
So you're going to feel like crap.

291
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:37,882
And then you just, you know,

292
00:17:38,082 --> 00:17:40,123
you just spiral because you don't know what to do.

293
00:17:42,153 --> 00:17:45,854
So I just urge you to please look at this number

294
00:17:45,894 --> 00:17:48,114
and think, what happens if I make that in year one?

295
00:17:48,314 --> 00:17:49,155
Will I be okay?

296
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:50,595
What can I do on the side?

297
00:17:50,675 --> 00:17:51,775
What can I do about it?

298
00:17:54,276 --> 00:17:57,116
So things you can do about it,

299
00:17:58,837 --> 00:18:00,517
you can come to one of these talks.

300
00:18:01,638 --> 00:18:03,478
There's not enough time for me to talk,

301
00:18:04,078 --> 00:18:05,018
you know, in this talk,

302
00:18:05,258 --> 00:18:09,439
about how you actually do be in that top 7%.

303
00:18:12,636 --> 00:18:17,678
However, I am giving talks tomorrow and then the same talk on Friday, so if you can't make

304
00:18:17,698 --> 00:18:19,639
it tomorrow, then you can come to the Friday one.

305
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:20,399
Don't go to both.

306
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:21,259
That would be silly.

307
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:28,022
But it's going to be a talk that doesn't cover all of the things you've already heard before.

308
00:18:28,342 --> 00:18:32,124
I'm not going to be talking about how to write a press release or make a trailer or talk

309
00:18:32,164 --> 00:18:33,404
to YouTubers or anything like that.

310
00:18:33,824 --> 00:18:35,985
I'm going to be talking about what I...

311
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:39,887
found were the most important things that

312
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,029
guaranteed us success with Descenders.

313
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,992
That no one ever talks about.

314
00:18:47,512 --> 00:18:50,494
Just the sort of image of your game

315
00:18:51,074 --> 00:18:55,857
and the way that you, the way your approach deals with the game and all that kind of

316
00:18:56,698 --> 00:18:59,499
stuff that maybe you haven't thought about, but you really should be.

317
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,962
Because it's the kind of stuff that actually makes games sell now.

318
00:19:05,085 --> 00:19:05,386
Cool, that's it.

319
00:19:05,486 --> 00:19:05,747
Thank you.

320
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:07,151
I hope you're okay.

321
00:19:07,693 --> 00:19:08,034
Thank you.

322
00:19:08,275 --> 00:19:08,516
Thank you.

323
00:19:08,536 --> 00:19:08,756
Thank you.
