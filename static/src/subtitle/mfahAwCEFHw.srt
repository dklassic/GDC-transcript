1
00:00:12,378 --> 00:00:13,559
Hello, GDC.

2
00:00:13,579 --> 00:00:16,162
Yeah, we can get a little crazy.

3
00:00:16,222 --> 00:00:16,963
It's the end of the day.

4
00:00:17,003 --> 00:00:18,966
Let's hear some applause for these panelists right now.

5
00:00:24,321 --> 00:00:27,403
Welcome, this is the state and future of tabletop games.

6
00:00:28,003 --> 00:00:32,486
If you're not in the right spot, this is your moment to walk awkwardly out of the room while we all watch.

7
00:00:33,407 --> 00:00:35,008
Everybody's in the right spot? That's good to know.

8
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:38,411
This is going to be a discussion, it's going to be an open discussion.

9
00:00:38,451 --> 00:00:42,814
I've got some amazing panelists here, and I'm going to introduce them here in just a moment.

10
00:00:43,274 --> 00:00:46,696
But before we start, I want to introduce myself. My name is Noxweiler Berff.

11
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:50,441
I am the creative director and general manager at Hunters Entertainment.

12
00:00:51,122 --> 00:00:55,287
I'm honored to be here, and I'm just as interested to hear how this panel goes as all of you.

13
00:00:55,307 --> 00:01:00,393
I'm really excited by the people that are up here, and we're going to go a little bit more into that in just a minute.

14
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:05,739
But before we start, they've asked me here at GDC to make sure that you know a few things.

15
00:01:06,644 --> 00:01:09,126
First of all, the silence is for your phone, not for you.

16
00:01:09,946 --> 00:01:13,790
We definitely want to make sure that all your devices are turned off, out of respect.

17
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,514
We're not getting rings and interruptions in the middle of this engaging conversation we're about to have.

18
00:01:19,635 --> 00:01:23,218
The other thing, though, is that feel free to interact. You just applauded. You can do more.

19
00:01:26,992 --> 00:01:29,473
Great. Let's keep the energy high and let's have a good time.

20
00:01:30,193 --> 00:01:33,074
Without further ado, I'd like to introduce you to your panel today.

21
00:01:34,015 --> 00:01:35,615
We have some amazing guest speakers up here.

22
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:38,416
Elizabeth Sampat, would you like to introduce yourself?

23
00:01:38,885 --> 00:01:41,787
Sure. Hi, my name is Elizabeth Sampat.

24
00:01:42,788 --> 00:01:47,231
Mostly, I've been working in digital games, a lot of mobile games.

25
00:01:47,271 --> 00:01:51,474
I've worked on Subway Surfers, Plants vs. Zombies 2, Hungry Shark World,

26
00:01:51,514 --> 00:01:55,517
but what a lot of people don't know is I actually got my start in indie role-playing games

27
00:01:56,257 --> 00:01:56,758
back in like 2006, 2007.

28
00:01:57,358 --> 00:02:03,062
I also made an independent game called Deadbolt that was an IndieCade nominee,

29
00:02:03,262 --> 00:02:06,605
I think back in 2013, and I'm just really excited to be up here.

30
00:02:07,303 --> 00:02:08,043
Thank you so much.

31
00:02:08,984 --> 00:02:10,145
Carol Mertz, you're next.

32
00:02:10,225 --> 00:02:11,206
What do you want to say about yourself?

33
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:13,108
Hi, I'm Carol Mertz.

34
00:02:13,308 --> 00:02:15,430
I am a senior game designer at Exploding Kittens,

35
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,371
which is a mass market board game publisher.

36
00:02:18,032 --> 00:02:20,954
And I work on design and development

37
00:02:21,195 --> 00:02:22,396
of those mass market games.

38
00:02:22,436 --> 00:02:24,457
So I worked on Hand to Hand Wombat,

39
00:02:24,537 --> 00:02:27,140
which had an accessibility post-mortem earlier today,

40
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,740
you may have seen,

41
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:31,143
as well as Exploding Kittens Recipes for Disaster,

42
00:02:31,824 --> 00:02:32,764
Exploding Kittens Two-Player,

43
00:02:32,845 --> 00:02:35,707
and many, many more that are coming out later this year.

44
00:02:36,247 --> 00:02:40,030
So I also, before I was in board games, I worked on a lot of indie games.

45
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,092
Some of you may have played Hell Couch at a previous GDC,

46
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:47,635
and other various indie video games and things.

47
00:02:48,195 --> 00:02:48,936
But yeah, that's me.

48
00:02:49,716 --> 00:02:50,377
Thanks for being here.

49
00:02:50,497 --> 00:02:51,097
Thank you.

50
00:02:51,618 --> 00:02:54,059
Ming Liu, would you like to talk a little bit about yourself and what you do?

51
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,941
Hi, everybody. My name is Ming Liu.

52
00:02:56,961 --> 00:03:01,765
I now work for 90s Soundfire UX as a Senior UX Research Manager.

53
00:03:02,105 --> 00:03:05,387
I'm a big fan of tape top games and Half-Rich.

54
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:11,599
experience. This time I attend to this round table. I'm really happy I have this chance to

55
00:03:12,339 --> 00:03:18,261
talk with everybody about the tabletop game. We're really excited to have you. Thanks for being here.

56
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:23,062
Last but certainly not least, we have Cole Worley. Would you like to talk a little bit about

57
00:03:23,082 --> 00:03:28,283
yourself and what you do? Hi, my name is Cole. Hello. My name is Cole. I'm the creative director

58
00:03:28,324 --> 00:03:34,085
at Leader Games, co-founder of Worley Games. I designed Root and Oath and Pax Premier and the

59
00:03:34,145 --> 00:03:34,825
upcoming game ARX.

60
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,884
And I do a lot of work helping to organize the studio as well.

61
00:03:39,924 --> 00:03:42,505
We're a small studio based in St. Paul, Minnesota.

62
00:03:43,285 --> 00:03:46,787
But we have about 15 people and we are dedicated to making our weird games.

63
00:03:47,587 --> 00:03:48,947
Amazing. Thank you again for being here.

64
00:03:49,528 --> 00:03:52,769
So we've got a number of great panelists here. We're going to get right into it.

65
00:03:52,809 --> 00:03:54,029
We're going to have a conversation.

66
00:03:54,189 --> 00:03:58,471
I've prepared a few questions just to get us started, but then we're going to want to open it up to all of you.

67
00:03:58,991 --> 00:04:03,132
So when the time comes, if you have questions, we're going to ask that you very orderly,

68
00:04:03,613 --> 00:04:07,434
in a way that you can understand each other, you're going to break up here onto either side.

69
00:04:07,474 --> 00:04:10,135
There is a microphone here and a microphone on this side.

70
00:04:10,915 --> 00:04:14,977
But only when I give you the word that we're going to actually break off into audience questions,

71
00:04:15,017 --> 00:04:16,697
I'd say don't start lining up right away.

72
00:04:16,717 --> 00:04:17,978
You're going to be standing there for a little while.

73
00:04:18,995 --> 00:04:27,743
All right, well, let's jump right into it and let's talk about this and find out exactly how these panelists feel about where we're at now with tabletop games in the year 2023.

74
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:36,150
The first question that I have is a pretty straightforward basic question that's going to give us a bit of an overview of what we're talking about today.

75
00:04:37,351 --> 00:04:40,934
What is the most important innovation in the tabletop space at this time?

76
00:04:42,255 --> 00:04:44,597
I'm going to start with Carol. Carol, do you want to speak a little bit on that?

77
00:04:45,913 --> 00:04:47,234
This is the simple question.

78
00:04:48,814 --> 00:04:55,458
I honestly, what I'm seeing right now is a lot of publishers really pushing toward ecological sustainability.

79
00:04:56,178 --> 00:05:01,321
I think this is also, you know, when we get into the future, this is going to be shocking also what I talk about there.

80
00:05:02,342 --> 00:05:08,425
But we're seeing a lot of publishers getting really excited about looking for ways that we can go to production and use...

81
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:12,967
recycled materials, think about ways that we can cut down on

82
00:05:13,327 --> 00:05:18,710
components and, you know, space in shipping containers, things like that.

83
00:05:20,852 --> 00:05:23,533
It's really interesting to see. And then we've got like the Green Games Alliance,

84
00:05:23,553 --> 00:05:27,335
which I don't know if any y'all have heard of this, but they just released this amazing paper

85
00:05:27,856 --> 00:05:30,517
specifically covering this and specifically on how

86
00:05:31,017 --> 00:05:35,000
publishers and designers can be taking this into greater consideration. So yes, that's

87
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:40,061
To me, I think, is the number one biggest innovation and most important innovation that we're seeing right now.

88
00:05:40,421 --> 00:05:46,303
It uses a lot of paper. It's no joke what we do in our industry and creating so much waste.

89
00:05:46,423 --> 00:05:49,084
And there are ways that we can improve that. So that makes a lot of sense.

90
00:05:50,264 --> 00:05:52,685
Thanks, Carol. Elizabeth, do you want to take the question?

91
00:05:53,194 --> 00:05:58,718
Sure. As you probably won't be surprised from my background, I think one of the most interesting

92
00:05:58,738 --> 00:06:04,242
things that's been happening lately is sort of the blurring of lines between tabletop games and

93
00:06:04,562 --> 00:06:09,746
digital games. A lot of digital games having companion apps or getting digital versions of

94
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:13,589
games so that you can, you know, play Lords of Waterdeep on the airplane without bringing a

95
00:06:13,609 --> 00:06:19,553
whole bunch of cards or that kind of thing. I think the sort of, you know, they've always been

96
00:06:20,053 --> 00:06:21,474
quite separate, I think, but I think

97
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:29,559
In a way, that's bringing the joy and the togetherness of sitting side by side and playing a board game together,

98
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,560
places where you wouldn't normally be able to.

99
00:06:31,841 --> 00:06:36,103
It's interesting that you bring that up. We're actually going to talk a little bit more about that in depth in just a little while.

100
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:38,144
It's exciting, yeah. Cole, do you have a thought?

101
00:06:38,705 --> 00:06:44,788
Well, just building on that, I think one of the biggest changes in the past two, three years

102
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:48,310
that is really changing how games get made and played is

103
00:06:49,024 --> 00:06:55,671
Not just the shift to digital spaces, but also the shift of the conversation around games to digital places.

104
00:06:55,711 --> 00:06:57,754
Now, they've been in digital places for a long time, obviously.

105
00:06:57,794 --> 00:07:02,799
We have websites like BoardGameGeek and venues like Reddit and Twitter, where there's always been a lot of discussion about board games.

106
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:08,306
But increasingly, sites like Discord and Discord servers are becoming real hubs for not just...

107
00:07:08,806 --> 00:07:11,907
the discussion of games, but the generation of new games.

108
00:07:11,967 --> 00:07:15,948
So, you know, many game series, and I'll just sort of reference two,

109
00:07:16,988 --> 00:07:20,289
in the conflict simulation world, the COIN series,

110
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:24,791
the counterinsurgency series, and the levying campaign series,

111
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:28,051
which are two fairly complex historical game series,

112
00:07:28,432 --> 00:07:31,292
both have extremely active discords that have produced

113
00:07:31,472 --> 00:07:34,373
literally dozens of new iterations of the games,

114
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:36,854
many of which are going right into publication pipelines.

115
00:07:37,254 --> 00:07:42,598
So we're seeing a real democratization of the publishing process and of the development process,

116
00:07:42,618 --> 00:07:44,540
and it's happening in those kinds of digital spaces.

117
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,241
Yeah, I don't think anybody can argue that it's changing everything.

118
00:07:47,982 --> 00:07:52,165
You know, there's a lot of different tools that are out there, but Discord has definitely changed the game.

119
00:07:52,986 --> 00:07:55,027
Ming, would you like to take the question? Do you have anything you'd like to say?

120
00:07:55,147 --> 00:08:03,533
Yeah, I want to talk. Because in China, the tabletop development history is quite different with the Western world.

121
00:08:05,246 --> 00:08:14,029
Maybe in these three years, because of from maybe from 2020, because during the pandemic,

122
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:22,591
in China the main case of this is that the modern technology has made it possible for gamers to

123
00:08:22,631 --> 00:08:30,133
select to play with friends online. Now a lot of tabletop games, the players can use the app.

124
00:08:30,723 --> 00:08:31,926
play with friends online.

125
00:08:32,347 --> 00:08:35,896
So more and more times, like such as us,

126
00:08:35,997 --> 00:08:39,145
we talked with our friends, said.

127
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,020
Let's play together this night.

128
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:48,521
We open a new room on the app, so we can simplify the process

129
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:51,021
by only needing to click on application

130
00:08:51,582 --> 00:08:55,662
and lowering the entry bar when we play the game.

131
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:58,263
So mobile apps are making things more accessible for everybody.

132
00:08:58,303 --> 00:09:00,423
Yeah, I don't think any of us are going to argue with that.

133
00:09:01,224 --> 00:09:02,964
OK, let's move on to the next question.

134
00:09:04,172 --> 00:09:06,933
What game or games do you feel are innovating the space

135
00:09:06,973 --> 00:09:07,913
currently and why?

136
00:09:08,713 --> 00:09:10,313
Ming, why don't we start with you this time, if you,

137
00:09:10,573 --> 00:09:11,753
or do you want some time to think about it

138
00:09:11,773 --> 00:09:12,774
and I can bounce back?

139
00:09:13,234 --> 00:09:13,714
Yeah.

140
00:09:17,274 --> 00:09:19,935
This part I will talk about maybe like such as

141
00:09:20,175 --> 00:09:24,196
script murder I just talked with during my themes.

142
00:09:24,976 --> 00:09:27,556
Because script murder is the most famous,

143
00:09:29,877 --> 00:09:31,897
famous, sorry.

144
00:09:32,397 --> 00:09:33,577
That's okay, no, take your time.

145
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:43,208
The form and design of the most popular tiktok in China, because people can play the character

146
00:09:43,308 --> 00:09:49,578
they choose and play with other fans together, be like such like a LARP game.

147
00:09:54,316 --> 00:09:58,100
The core of this game is to create a social and immersive experience,

148
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,624
making players feel like they are not just playing a board game,

149
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,846
but also part of our ARP,

150
00:10:04,207 --> 00:10:07,650
where they can perform and fully immerse themselves.

151
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:13,716
Okay. Cole, what game or games do you feel like are innovating the space currently, and why?

152
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:20,609
Well, I think one of the interesting things about tabletop is how the different sectors of innovation often don't talk to each other.

153
00:10:20,669 --> 00:10:24,990
And then there'll be these moments where a particular mechanism or idea sort of cross pollinates.

154
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:34,232
And I think we're right on the edge of one of those moments or maybe in one when it comes to the cross pollination between what's happening in the indie RPG scene and what's happening in tabletop.

155
00:10:34,632 --> 00:10:39,613
One of the games that really blew me away that I've played recently is Ross Cowan's The City of Winter.

156
00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:41,914
I played The Fall of Magic, was quite impressed with it.

157
00:10:42,014 --> 00:10:43,294
But The City of Winter.

158
00:10:44,967 --> 00:10:49,608
does something really remarkable, which is that it's essentially a collaborative storytelling

159
00:10:49,628 --> 00:10:54,470
game, but it provides about two steps more structure than most collaborative storytelling

160
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:54,690
games.

161
00:10:54,730 --> 00:11:01,853
And the result is that it has an incredibly intimate and profound storytelling generation

162
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:05,494
system that is great for players who are usually uncomfortable working in that form.

163
00:11:05,534 --> 00:11:10,036
And I think we're going to see a lot more games, tabletop, more traditional board games

164
00:11:10,296 --> 00:11:12,037
building on some of those storytelling practices.

165
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,402
If I could jump in there instead of giving my own answer.

166
00:11:15,422 --> 00:11:17,463
I couldn't agree more.

167
00:11:17,483 --> 00:11:21,585
I think that you even see that coming from the indie RPG section.

168
00:11:21,645 --> 00:11:25,926
Those role-playing games becoming almost more board game-like.

169
00:11:25,967 --> 00:11:31,509
I'm thinking a lot about the work of Avery Alder, who's a phenomenal RPG designer with

170
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:33,370
The Quiet Year, where you're sort of making a map.

171
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:41,295
Also, she has Ribbon Drive, which is a game where basically you're telling a story about a road trip that you're all taking together.

172
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:47,860
And one of the core mechanics of the game is actually that everybody brings their own mix CD or their own playlist.

173
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,882
And the playlist actually informs what happens in the games.

174
00:11:51,342 --> 00:11:56,086
So I think particularly when you're talking about what's happening on the bleeding edge in tabletop RPGs.

175
00:11:56,486 --> 00:12:01,469
You see them pushing more and more towards having more tactility and physical components,

176
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:06,391
and I think we're also going to see sort of the lines blurring between tabletop board games

177
00:12:06,431 --> 00:12:08,492
and tabletop role-playing games in the future.

178
00:12:08,832 --> 00:12:14,055
Can I offer just a small footnote to your reminder, which is that both a lot of Avery Adler's games

179
00:12:14,115 --> 00:12:19,018
and also The City of Winter and Fall of Magic, it's worth noting, are produced domestically.

180
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:23,800
And they have really amazing physical productions, but they're produced in Washington State.

181
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:28,728
and are very conscious about the sustainability of their materials.

182
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:31,849
Great job just tying like all three of us together there.

183
00:12:32,549 --> 00:12:33,209
Perfect.

184
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:34,169
Carol you want to add anything?

185
00:12:34,489 --> 00:12:37,850
Yeah so for me I think it's less about necessarily innovation and more about

186
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:42,831
leaning into the needs that we kind of discovered among ourselves during the pandemic.

187
00:12:42,871 --> 00:12:46,431
Like this sense of isolation, the sense of needing connection.

188
00:12:46,511 --> 00:12:50,092
We're seeing a lot of these really beautiful games like we're not really strangers.

189
00:12:50,552 --> 00:12:53,574
and the mind and wavelength and these things that kind of develop

190
00:12:54,855 --> 00:13:01,419
more verbal intimacy among players in a really interesting way that allows people to feel more

191
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:05,902
connected even if they can't play in the same space which I think is something that is really

192
00:13:05,942 --> 00:13:10,245
special that we're seeing right now in the mass market. So this is stuff that people who are not

193
00:13:10,285 --> 00:13:14,248
traditional board game players are seeing and engaging with and to me I think that's really

194
00:13:14,308 --> 00:13:18,811
special and a really interesting way of pulling people into this space that we're seeing more

195
00:13:18,871 --> 00:13:20,111
now than we've ever seen before.

196
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,981
I mean, the pandemic changed everything.

197
00:13:22,221 --> 00:13:22,521
Oh, yeah.

198
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,463
Especially with GameSpace, I think it carried people through a lot, you know?

199
00:13:25,663 --> 00:13:30,205
And the way that it's evolving because of that, I think is really interesting.

200
00:13:31,266 --> 00:13:32,707
All right, let's move on a little bit here.

201
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:38,270
What advice would you give to designers for developing games for the future?

202
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:41,571
In kind of the, I don't want to say post-pandemic,

203
00:13:41,591 --> 00:13:43,412
but the pandemic world that we're in now?

204
00:13:43,633 --> 00:13:46,634
I mean, like, what advice would you give those designers?

205
00:13:46,874 --> 00:13:47,535
Do you want to start, Carol?

206
00:13:48,115 --> 00:13:48,295
Sure.

207
00:13:48,355 --> 00:13:50,416
I mean, like I said earlier, thinking

208
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,857
with environmental sustainability in mind,

209
00:13:53,137 --> 00:13:55,078
that starts at the design concept.

210
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:58,460
So thinking about how you can develop games that just use

211
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,941
less but do more is something that

212
00:14:02,102 --> 00:14:02,962
is going to be really important.

213
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,243
Also, right now, as we're seeing,

214
00:14:04,503 --> 00:14:07,104
obviously the economy is softening a little bit,

215
00:14:07,144 --> 00:14:09,245
and publishers have less money to put into games.

216
00:14:09,705 --> 00:14:11,186
Cost of goods have to stay lower.

217
00:14:11,646 --> 00:14:15,328
So figuring out how you can keep your component costs down

218
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:15,908
is going to be.

219
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:20,257
how you're going to find a publisher who actually wants to publish your work, right?

220
00:14:20,739 --> 00:14:26,071
So, you know, thinking in those lines, we're, you know, we're solving two problems here.

221
00:14:26,828 --> 00:14:29,709
helping the planet by reducing greenhouse gases,

222
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:33,530
and we're also making games that are more affordable

223
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,811
for our players and that are more affordable

224
00:14:35,851 --> 00:14:36,891
to produce in general.

225
00:14:36,971 --> 00:14:39,912
So that's kind of where I would suggest

226
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,072
that especially new designers start thinking,

227
00:14:43,073 --> 00:14:44,453
especially as they're starting to pitch

228
00:14:44,473 --> 00:14:45,473
to their first publishers,

229
00:14:45,913 --> 00:14:48,594
doing that conscientiously and being able to say

230
00:14:48,614 --> 00:14:50,134
to their publishers, hey,

231
00:14:52,095 --> 00:14:54,255
let me help you become more sustainable

232
00:14:54,455 --> 00:14:56,336
is I think a really, really smart move right now.

233
00:14:57,946 --> 00:15:00,207
Great. Elizabeth, do you want to start with something?

234
00:15:00,247 --> 00:15:03,009
Sure. My answer is a little bit more touchy-feely,

235
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:05,350
just based on the kinds of games that I make.

236
00:15:06,231 --> 00:15:10,053
I would really strongly suggest that you think about what is

237
00:15:10,193 --> 00:15:13,975
missing in your social interactions with the people that you want to play with.

238
00:15:14,075 --> 00:15:18,978
Because if any game is a two-player game or has more than one player,

239
00:15:19,358 --> 00:15:21,939
that game is fundamentally about social interaction,

240
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:23,820
first and foremost, before anything else.

241
00:15:24,401 --> 00:15:27,203
So, if you're starting, when you're starting working on a game,

242
00:15:27,243 --> 00:15:29,825
think about what you want the social experience to be,

243
00:15:29,865 --> 00:15:31,846
what you want the social dynamics to look like,

244
00:15:32,327 --> 00:15:35,049
and then start thinking about what is an experience

245
00:15:35,349 --> 00:15:38,492
that you would like to have that you haven't had in games.

246
00:15:38,572 --> 00:15:41,574
I think something a lot of new designers sort of get hung up on

247
00:15:41,634 --> 00:15:44,597
is wanting to almost recreate their favorite game

248
00:15:44,697 --> 00:15:47,299
or the game that made them love games as a child.

249
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:50,982
But really, if you look at all of the wonderful experiences you're having,

250
00:15:51,142 --> 00:15:51,202
and...

251
00:15:51,622 --> 00:15:53,604
You sort of catalog them and you ask yourself,

252
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:56,426
what's missing and how can I get there?

253
00:15:56,887 --> 00:15:58,168
I think you'll end up with something

254
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,290
that has a really unique proposition

255
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,412
that would be highly marketable

256
00:16:03,592 --> 00:16:05,354
and also compelling to people.

257
00:16:05,574 --> 00:16:07,315
Yes, I love telling people to think

258
00:16:07,415 --> 00:16:08,917
about their players as components.

259
00:16:09,037 --> 00:16:11,599
Yes, so like these are bodies that you can utilize.

260
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,641
Use it, like, right?

261
00:16:13,821 --> 00:16:14,061
Yeah.

262
00:16:14,481 --> 00:16:15,182
That's interesting.

263
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:16,883
Players as components, that makes sense.

264
00:16:17,764 --> 00:16:19,285
Cole, do you wanna talk a little bit about this?

265
00:16:19,626 --> 00:16:20,106
Yeah, I think.

266
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:28,146
It's so important to tell new designers to emphasize the degree to which games aren't

267
00:16:28,226 --> 00:16:29,768
created by a single person.

268
00:16:30,048 --> 00:16:33,211
Even if you are a single person alone, you need those player components.

269
00:16:33,271 --> 00:16:34,973
You need them to help you make the thing.

270
00:16:35,545 --> 00:16:39,608
And so any game that gets made is made because there was a community that rallied around it

271
00:16:39,668 --> 00:16:41,910
and that helped you take the game across the finish line.

272
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:42,991
So you have to pay attention.

273
00:16:43,051 --> 00:16:47,195
A good starting game designer is also going to be a good community manager

274
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:48,396
at some very core level.

275
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:53,720
And one way to do that, kind of riffing off the recent comment,

276
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,703
is to think about the urgency of the game.

277
00:16:56,743 --> 00:16:59,085
There has to be a reason for them to want to play.

278
00:16:59,105 --> 00:17:01,167
And one of the best things that you can do as a new game designer

279
00:17:02,835 --> 00:17:06,638
is ask yourself, why does this game need to exist at all?

280
00:17:06,678 --> 00:17:07,359
What is the urgency?

281
00:17:07,379 --> 00:17:09,621
What's the thing that is making me want to finish this?

282
00:17:10,382 --> 00:17:13,024
And if you could find that argument,

283
00:17:13,084 --> 00:17:14,486
the urgency of your game, then you'll

284
00:17:14,506 --> 00:17:16,207
be able to rally other people to that flag.

285
00:17:16,227 --> 00:17:17,769
And that's going to help create the community that's

286
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:19,310
going to take the game across the finish line.

287
00:17:20,431 --> 00:17:20,752
Great.

288
00:17:21,572 --> 00:17:22,333
Would you like to talk, Ming?

289
00:17:22,613 --> 00:17:22,874
OK.

290
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:26,657
I will give some advice based on Chinese background.

291
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:32,432
So my advice is IP crossover and mutual learning

292
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:35,333
can better complement the tabletop game and the video

293
00:17:35,353 --> 00:17:38,635
game, which are not at odds with one another.

294
00:17:39,295 --> 00:17:43,697
And the second is for the tabletop game

295
00:17:43,757 --> 00:17:45,858
to grow in popularity in China, they

296
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:49,000
must be combined with other entertainment medium,

297
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,262
like variety shows and the internet and the television

298
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:54,082
in order to gain.

299
00:17:54,509 --> 00:18:05,175
Mutual publicity, strengthening their social aspects as a selling point, and drawing more players as a fresh form of entertainment for daily life.

300
00:18:06,396 --> 00:18:12,320
Great. I'm going to actually veer us off the road here a little bit, because I have kind of a sub-question to what I just asked.

301
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:20,725
As designers yourselves, what tools and methods do you use to start a project? And anybody who wants to jump in can just start.

302
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:26,636
Interestingly, during the pandemic, we leaned so hard on tabletop simulator.

303
00:18:26,656 --> 00:18:27,436
Oh yeah.

304
00:18:27,516 --> 00:18:31,078
And now that we're also just in a hybrid work environment, we still use it a lot.

305
00:18:31,158 --> 00:18:37,540
It sucks. It feels like you have forks for hands, but it's so helpful because you can rapidly iterate,

306
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,361
you can change things up, you can pop in a brand new game in seconds.

307
00:18:41,741 --> 00:18:43,261
And that's made a really big difference.

308
00:18:44,222 --> 00:18:46,424
Fuck, having forks for hands isn't so bad sometimes.

309
00:18:46,444 --> 00:18:47,124
Forks for hands.

310
00:18:47,164 --> 00:18:50,427
Do you feel like you would have used it if you had been in a position where you kind

311
00:18:50,447 --> 00:18:50,867
of had it?

312
00:18:50,887 --> 00:18:51,748
Absolutely not.

313
00:18:51,808 --> 00:18:54,290
No, we would have avoided it at all costs.

314
00:18:55,371 --> 00:18:59,555
Like you know, obviously we do prototyping in-house, you know, like we'll do rapid prototypes

315
00:18:59,635 --> 00:19:02,758
as quickly as we can, mock it up in Illustrator or whatever and print it out.

316
00:19:03,238 --> 00:19:06,941
But again, talking about sustainability, that uses a lot of materials and if you're wanting

317
00:19:06,981 --> 00:19:11,665
to rapidly iterate, moving into a digital space is such a good way of doing that.

318
00:19:12,226 --> 00:19:20,071
Can I ask you really quickly, how do you gather playtest materials and like when you're working with a team and they're giving you feedback on something that you're testing out in that space?

319
00:19:20,971 --> 00:19:23,693
What do you do to kind of collect that information and then utilize it?

320
00:19:24,648 --> 00:19:43,886
Are you talking about just play test data play test data specifically with a digital space like working with folks. Yeah, I love recording it like that's it. That's something that I pulled from video games is like you'll see a lot of play test discussions talking about like well, you can just record your play tests if they're digital. So I like you know will play over zoom. So I'll record the zoom call will do screen share.

321
00:19:44,246 --> 00:19:47,668
We record what's happening on the table and we record players' reactions.

322
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,089
And that's ultimately where you get your information.

323
00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:52,450
It's so truthful because sometimes you get playtest,

324
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:55,411
you have to filter everything because you're not sure how the people who are

325
00:19:55,431 --> 00:19:59,433
undergoing the playtest are honestly responding to what you've given them.

326
00:19:59,453 --> 00:20:00,954
And so you've got to kind of filter it through that.

327
00:20:00,974 --> 00:20:03,195
But when you have that video content that you can look back on,

328
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:07,677
being able to then kind of witness their reactions to things tells you a lot.

329
00:20:07,757 --> 00:20:09,217
Yeah, you can tell when people check out.

330
00:20:09,257 --> 00:20:10,558
You can tell when people are having fun.

331
00:20:10,618 --> 00:20:11,398
It's so important.

332
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,357
Yeah, we do it at hunters all the time.

333
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:14,658
Anybody else want to jump in?

334
00:20:14,778 --> 00:20:18,901
So I want to say something about TTS, a tabletop simulator, because it really, I mean it trans,

335
00:20:18,961 --> 00:20:22,544
I think everyone who works in the industry professionally, it transformed our workflow.

336
00:20:22,644 --> 00:20:26,967
The iterative loop that used to depend on your poor play tester having to go to FedEx

337
00:20:27,027 --> 00:20:31,410
after work to print and assemble a new copy and hope it's done in time for their Friday

338
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,611
game night, that's gone now.

339
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:37,115
Now we get to push out versions and it starts looking a lot more like video game development.

340
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:43,458
And so I want to offer a very technical comment about TTS for people who use it to test, which

341
00:20:43,518 --> 00:20:47,784
is the most valuable thing you can do when you're using TTS, and this is so specific,

342
00:20:47,844 --> 00:20:52,070
so sorry about narrowing the scope of this panel, is to turn off caching.

343
00:20:53,383 --> 00:20:58,307
And to host the files somewhere where you have direct access to their links.

344
00:20:58,347 --> 00:21:00,208
So getting a direct Dropbox link.

345
00:21:00,228 --> 00:21:03,791
And the reason for this is then when you export using InDesign and you

346
00:21:03,831 --> 00:21:06,933
export all your files, you load up TTS and you don't have to do anything.

347
00:21:07,193 --> 00:21:09,395
All of the cards are now the most current version.

348
00:21:09,715 --> 00:21:12,196
And I wish someone would have told me that eight months into the pandemic

349
00:21:12,236 --> 00:21:15,859
after we spent so long updating all these silly JSON files.

350
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:18,741
I mean, the main tool that I feel like I use are.

351
00:21:20,075 --> 00:21:22,680
You basically ask yourself the question when you're starting to design,

352
00:21:23,141 --> 00:21:28,331
what do I need to implement a new adjustment to this game and to test it?

353
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:32,136
And just write out the test as if you were doing a factory study.

354
00:21:32,396 --> 00:21:33,176
What are the steps?

355
00:21:33,676 --> 00:21:35,677
And then get better at those steps.

356
00:21:35,937 --> 00:21:37,438
Spend some time learning InDesign.

357
00:21:37,478 --> 00:21:39,559
Spend some time learning Tabletop Simulator.

358
00:21:39,859 --> 00:21:41,420
And if you don't want to pay for Tabletop Simulator,

359
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,881
know that there are many good free alternatives, including

360
00:21:43,961 --> 00:21:46,462
ScreenTop, which is fully browser-based.

361
00:21:46,843 --> 00:21:49,444
Likewise, many of the things that InDesign does

362
00:21:49,484 --> 00:21:51,325
can be done in other pieces of software.

363
00:21:52,585 --> 00:21:52,845
Great.

364
00:21:52,885 --> 00:21:54,046
Does anybody else want to jump in on this?

365
00:21:54,435 --> 00:22:01,258
I guess one thing that's more geared towards indie developers than people who are already

366
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:03,220
working inside of a company.

367
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:09,283
I know one question, when I was doing a lot of talks about tabletop game design, one of

368
00:22:09,343 --> 00:22:13,325
the number one questions I would get is, how do I even get playtesters?

369
00:22:14,426 --> 00:22:19,811
And I would say that the number one most important tool you have are your friends and your family,

370
00:22:19,852 --> 00:22:25,097
because if you pitch them a game idea and they don't want to playtest it, that's already information for you.

371
00:22:26,909 --> 00:22:30,492
Like, I hate to say it, but that's the first and best funnel,

372
00:22:30,552 --> 00:22:33,534
because if what you really want to do is make games,

373
00:22:33,654 --> 00:22:35,696
you need to make sure that you're working on something

374
00:22:35,716 --> 00:22:37,297
that people are interested in playing.

375
00:22:37,738 --> 00:22:41,441
And so relying on the people who care about you most,

376
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:44,223
first and foremost, and who might be willing to go

377
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:45,804
a little bit outside of their comfort zone

378
00:22:45,844 --> 00:22:48,486
because they like you, if they're saying no to you,

379
00:22:48,847 --> 00:22:50,168
maybe move on to the next idea.

380
00:22:50,622 --> 00:22:54,843
Yeah, like if your pitch can't be on the back of the box and somebody looks at it in retail and is like,

381
00:22:54,883 --> 00:22:56,723
yeah, I want to buy it, then nobody's going to buy it.

382
00:22:56,924 --> 00:22:59,104
Right. Even if it's the greatest game in the world,

383
00:22:59,464 --> 00:23:03,565
you have to get the first couple people to buy it and tell their friends about it

384
00:23:03,885 --> 00:23:05,025
and force them to play it.

385
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:08,266
And if you can't get those first couple people, no one will ever know.

386
00:23:08,526 --> 00:23:11,807
So, it's a little like the practice of writing rules,

387
00:23:11,847 --> 00:23:15,107
where if you find yourself having a hard time articulating a rule,

388
00:23:15,707 --> 00:23:17,188
there's a problem with the design.

389
00:23:18,095 --> 00:23:22,198
The English language is a fabulous tool. It should be able to handle the rules of your game.

390
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,823
When you're actually boiling it down and you get that log line for your game,

391
00:23:26,883 --> 00:23:30,846
do you do that at the beginning of your process or at the end after you have the entire game?

392
00:23:31,227 --> 00:23:36,291
To me it's more like, I don't know if you're familiar with the way that music is made,

393
00:23:36,351 --> 00:23:41,696
but often what a vocalist will do is come in and almost a cappella do what they call a scratch track,

394
00:23:41,716 --> 00:23:42,177
which is just...

395
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:48,492
laying down the vocals and then the session musicians will come in and they'll lay down

396
00:23:48,532 --> 00:23:54,318
the instrumental tracks and then at the end the singer comes back and does the actual vocals

397
00:23:54,398 --> 00:23:58,722
and that's sort of the way I think about like the elevator pitch or the log line.

398
00:23:59,242 --> 00:24:02,523
You come up with one first, and that gets people into the door.

399
00:24:02,683 --> 00:24:04,924
And then the more you see how the game evolves,

400
00:24:05,764 --> 00:24:07,804
the very last thing you do is you go back

401
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:10,205
to that original elevator pitch or that log line,

402
00:24:10,545 --> 00:24:12,045
and you ask yourself if that makes sense

403
00:24:12,086 --> 00:24:13,466
and if there needs to be any alteration.

404
00:24:13,726 --> 00:24:14,026
Yeah, man.

405
00:24:14,046 --> 00:24:15,166
We're game designers.

406
00:24:15,186 --> 00:24:15,866
We playtest that shit.

407
00:24:15,967 --> 00:24:16,487
Exactly.

408
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:18,007
Iterate everything.

409
00:24:18,267 --> 00:24:20,428
Well, I think about a pitch for a game

410
00:24:20,968 --> 00:24:24,789
as the star that everything else is orbiting around.

411
00:24:24,949 --> 00:24:26,989
I've been working over the past couple of years

412
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:28,310
with this designer, Joe Kelly.

413
00:24:28,841 --> 00:24:33,804
on their game Molly House, which is about queer culture in 1720s London.

414
00:24:34,164 --> 00:24:39,587
And it's mostly about these houses where people were allowed to explore all kinds of different

415
00:24:39,627 --> 00:24:44,669
identities and the crackdown by the various early versions of the police, even before

416
00:24:44,709 --> 00:24:46,350
the police had really formed as an institution.

417
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:51,133
And the first time I played their game, I found the game to be a total mess, but the

418
00:24:51,173 --> 00:24:53,414
design, there was something about it that was very compelling.

419
00:24:53,614 --> 00:24:54,815
The core pitch was good.

420
00:24:55,295 --> 00:24:58,277
And then every time I would play a new version, the game was completely different.

421
00:24:58,838 --> 00:25:01,201
but they were still orbiting the same star.

422
00:25:01,561 --> 00:25:02,842
And so when I'm looking at a design,

423
00:25:02,882 --> 00:25:04,964
I don't really care if they're using the same mechanism

424
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,586
or if they have a clever little mechanical hook.

425
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:10,969
I'm really interested in what are the attributes of the star?

426
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:14,092
Because, and so allow yourself, if you're working on a game,

427
00:25:14,393 --> 00:25:17,275
to change things, to really dramatically reconfigure

428
00:25:17,295 --> 00:25:20,118
your game, especially if it's true to that initial pitch.

429
00:25:20,718 --> 00:25:22,080
I want to make a little space here for Ming.

430
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,521
Ming, do you want to jump in on this?

431
00:25:24,742 --> 00:25:24,922
Yeah.

432
00:25:26,945 --> 00:25:37,394
I maybe talk about skills based on China, because I will give our guys an example.

433
00:25:38,915 --> 00:25:47,683
Such as the whereof of mirror host initial user based on what's small due primarily to

434
00:25:48,204 --> 00:25:49,405
the offline experience.

435
00:25:50,192 --> 00:25:52,553
To ensure a positive gaming experience,

436
00:25:53,173 --> 00:25:55,394
every player needs a qualified host,

437
00:25:55,474 --> 00:25:57,955
and the players need to master extremely fine

438
00:25:58,015 --> 00:25:59,996
turn-design communication techniques.

439
00:26:00,836 --> 00:26:04,638
But after the app launched,

440
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,740
so more and more people can play by easier handle.

441
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,642
They can talk to each other by voice

442
00:26:14,862 --> 00:26:17,723
and tap the walls with other things.

443
00:26:20,129 --> 00:26:22,691
the same group, they can talk with them.

444
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:28,716
So the designer need to think, maybe based in China,

445
00:26:29,356 --> 00:26:34,200
need to think how it can be easily understand for the players.

446
00:26:34,841 --> 00:26:38,024
Because in China, most people just want to play the game

447
00:26:38,064 --> 00:26:40,125
with friends for a short time.

448
00:26:40,526 --> 00:26:45,710
They don't want to pay a lot of time to study.

449
00:26:46,124 --> 00:26:47,225
how to play the game.

450
00:26:47,825 --> 00:26:51,927
So based on China, need to be quite easier

451
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:53,207
for everybody can play.

452
00:26:53,828 --> 00:26:55,168
It's the most important part.

453
00:26:55,569 --> 00:26:57,670
That accessibility, do you have any advice

454
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,971
for how to create that in your game design?

455
00:27:00,171 --> 00:27:00,451
Yeah.

456
00:27:02,512 --> 00:27:06,033
It's most for them, it's easier to understand

457
00:27:06,253 --> 00:27:07,214
how to play the game.

458
00:27:07,814 --> 00:27:12,196
And they can use the tool or the other mechanics

459
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:15,538
to easy to join the game and play the game.

460
00:27:16,184 --> 00:27:16,845
Great, thank you.

461
00:27:18,086 --> 00:27:20,368
All right, does anybody want to jump in on the last of that,

462
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:21,168
or should we move on?

463
00:27:21,789 --> 00:27:22,429
Let's keep going.

464
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,852
Now, we've already talked a lot about this already,

465
00:27:26,092 --> 00:27:28,634
but I think there's so much more space for us to explore it.

466
00:27:29,075 --> 00:27:32,317
How do you see digital tools interacting with tabletop games

467
00:27:32,357 --> 00:27:34,259
in the future, and should it?

468
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,581
I think we all have opinions on this,

469
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:37,862
but let's start with Cole.

470
00:27:37,882 --> 00:27:39,263
Cole, do you want to take this?

471
00:27:40,004 --> 00:27:42,146
I'm curious if hand-to-hand wombat was developed

472
00:27:42,226 --> 00:27:43,307
using Tabletop Simulator.

473
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:46,405
And so I just, I want to ask that question before I provide my answer.

474
00:27:46,425 --> 00:27:47,066
Do it! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

475
00:27:48,107 --> 00:27:49,148
It's a long story.

476
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:50,889
We've got the time.

477
00:27:51,189 --> 00:27:54,432
So Hand to Hand Wombat evolved from a very, very different game

478
00:27:54,492 --> 00:27:57,014
that was testable in Tabletop Simulator,

479
00:27:57,054 --> 00:28:00,377
but unfortunately, obviously the physicality of it prevented.

480
00:28:00,437 --> 00:28:02,119
So for those of you who are unfamiliar,

481
00:28:02,199 --> 00:28:05,361
Hand to Hand Wombat is a very tactile social deduction game

482
00:28:05,381 --> 00:28:07,323
where you close your eyes and you build towers.

483
00:28:07,443 --> 00:28:08,364
And one of the people is...

484
00:28:09,505 --> 00:28:10,746
sabotaging those towers.

485
00:28:11,026 --> 00:28:14,008
So, you don't know who that is.

486
00:28:15,229 --> 00:28:16,930
It's just some bad wombat.

487
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:20,873
And doing that in Tabletop Simulator

488
00:28:21,053 --> 00:28:22,615
and getting all of the sizing right

489
00:28:22,675 --> 00:28:24,236
and importing all of the models and everything,

490
00:28:24,956 --> 00:28:26,057
you need the physicality.

491
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:26,878
You need the hands.

492
00:28:26,898 --> 00:28:29,500
Like I said, the players are components in this game.

493
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,161
So unfortunately, Tabletop Simulator.

494
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:36,175
But we did push it as far as we could go until we got to that point.

495
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:40,619
But it was an interesting process because we had to playtest it during the pandemic.

496
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,444
But yeah, Handy Hand Wombat is one where we actually decided to cut down on cost of goods.

497
00:28:47,024 --> 00:28:50,187
by incorporating the phone timer instead of incorporate,

498
00:28:50,207 --> 00:28:53,769
like we didn't want to add the additional cost

499
00:28:53,809 --> 00:28:57,612
for our players by having some custom design plastic,

500
00:28:58,113 --> 00:29:01,875
you know, timer that has an audio alarm.

501
00:29:02,536 --> 00:29:05,398
We decided folks already have phones in their pockets,

502
00:29:06,139 --> 00:29:08,941
you know, those phones are accessible

503
00:29:09,021 --> 00:29:11,723
so they can modify how the alarm goes off,

504
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:13,965
they can set it to vibrate, they can set it to a sound,

505
00:29:14,065 --> 00:29:14,785
whatever they want.

506
00:29:15,365 --> 00:29:17,326
and that that's gonna cut down on the cost of the game.

507
00:29:17,346 --> 00:29:19,546
Well, the reason I asked you about it

508
00:29:19,586 --> 00:29:21,227
is because it's one of the few games I knew

509
00:29:21,247 --> 00:29:22,287
that was made during the pandemic,

510
00:29:22,307 --> 00:29:25,688
which to me doesn't show its pandemic pedigree.

511
00:29:27,248 --> 00:29:30,609
We were working on my game Oath during the pandemic

512
00:29:30,709 --> 00:29:33,850
and its development took a turn, mostly for the better,

513
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:36,050
during the pandemic because it changed

514
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:37,391
the way the game worked.

515
00:29:37,731 --> 00:29:40,511
We had a version of Oath that we played literally

516
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:42,312
the day in the office before we shut it down

517
00:29:42,612 --> 00:29:44,372
where players took single action impulses.

518
00:29:44,728 --> 00:29:46,229
It was a kind of radical branch of the game.

519
00:29:46,269 --> 00:29:47,229
It was sort of promising.

520
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:50,290
Then the pandemic happened, and we changed how the game worked

521
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,970
to give players a little bit longer turns

522
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:55,131
because it was so much easier to play test digitally

523
00:29:55,511 --> 00:29:56,831
if someone just takes their turn,

524
00:29:56,911 --> 00:29:58,412
and then we know that in the course of the game,

525
00:29:58,432 --> 00:29:59,612
you're going to be taking eight turns

526
00:30:00,052 --> 00:30:03,313
with four or five actions rather than 60 turns

527
00:30:03,473 --> 00:30:04,673
with lots of little interrupts.

528
00:30:05,213 --> 00:30:07,834
And I think that we're starting to actually see

529
00:30:07,934 --> 00:30:09,214
in the crop of games that have come out

530
00:30:09,254 --> 00:30:10,154
in the past couple of years,

531
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,535
the marks of design during pandemic, for better and worse.

532
00:30:13,905 --> 00:30:18,068
You know, one of the examples that comes to mind is Isaac Childress's new Gloomhaven

533
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:22,571
title, Frosthaven, which to me is like barely a physical object.

534
00:30:22,591 --> 00:30:27,794
And I like a lot of things about the design, but if you've ever tried to open up the

535
00:30:27,854 --> 00:30:31,737
box you'll ask yourself the question, is this supposed to be a board game at all?

536
00:30:31,777 --> 00:30:33,058
I mean, it's so large.

537
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:39,902
And one can see how they developed it extensively using digital tools, but it maybe wasn't

538
00:30:40,103 --> 00:30:42,044
as designed to be a physical object.

539
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:49,146
You know, so I've had this, you know, we've been sorting through this problem when it comes to questions of, you know, introducing games with interrupts.

540
00:30:49,246 --> 00:30:51,208
Interrupts are really hard to do in a digital space.

541
00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:55,534
Even when you're running cameras and you can see people, it's just hard to communicate that.

542
00:30:55,734 --> 00:31:03,263
And I compare that to design work, you know, something like Sid Saxon's I'm the Boss from the early 90s, which is a game entirely built around interrupts.

543
00:31:03,709 --> 00:31:06,552
Something like that I feel like just couldn't exist in the current mode because of these digital tools.

544
00:31:06,572 --> 00:31:10,397
It's hard enough to have a logistical conversation on Zoom, let alone an interrupting mechanic.

545
00:31:10,718 --> 00:31:14,863
Right, and so I think that there's been a lot that we've gained from using these digital tools,

546
00:31:15,264 --> 00:31:19,409
but they are also steering the design conversation away from certain kinds of designs.

547
00:31:20,048 --> 00:31:24,929
Do you, as a follow-up to that, do you feel like there are things that you now do completely

548
00:31:24,969 --> 00:31:27,730
different in your design studio based on what you've learned from that?

549
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:32,812
Or are you trying to move yourself back over to some of your original techniques and processes?

550
00:31:32,952 --> 00:31:36,993
When it came to the development of ARX, I didn't build the TTS kit for the first year

551
00:31:37,033 --> 00:31:38,653
of iteration, which was a lot of work.

552
00:31:38,733 --> 00:31:43,195
And it was done on purpose because I wanted to make sure that the core action loop of

553
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:46,816
the game was players sitting around a table and having that back and forth.

554
00:31:47,109 --> 00:31:48,730
And then once we got to the more serious development work,

555
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,250
of course we had to move it into DTS.

556
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,931
But we've had to introduce kind of safeguards

557
00:31:53,331 --> 00:31:56,593
to protect our design practice from too much digital thinking

558
00:31:57,033 --> 00:31:59,774
in that early stage where it's particularly vulnerable.

559
00:32:01,094 --> 00:32:01,434
Amazing.

560
00:32:02,715 --> 00:32:04,055
Ming, do you have anything you'd like to add to this?

561
00:32:04,535 --> 00:32:09,117
Yeah, for this question, I think the digital is quite

562
00:32:09,537 --> 00:32:12,658
useful for the board game, such as some games.

563
00:32:13,292 --> 00:32:17,554
When we first take the box, we play the game, we need to read the rule.

564
00:32:17,915 --> 00:32:24,499
But it's the first time, we can't make sure the rules I understand is right or is wrong.

565
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:34,205
So the first time if I use the board game and use an app, we can check my think is right.

566
00:32:34,685 --> 00:32:41,970
Okay, we can play together and use the app help us to check every step is good.

567
00:32:43,177 --> 00:32:49,343
We think it can help us, okay, maybe it's kind of easier for everybody to play the game

568
00:32:49,483 --> 00:32:50,304
as the first time.

569
00:32:50,764 --> 00:32:53,106
So it's a guide in initially learning the game.

570
00:32:53,206 --> 00:32:53,406
Yeah.

571
00:32:54,007 --> 00:32:54,667
Okay, great.

572
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:55,929
Do you want to jump in?

573
00:32:55,949 --> 00:32:57,390
Do you have anything that you'd like to add, Elizabeth?

574
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:58,050
Sure.

575
00:32:58,231 --> 00:33:02,675
I think one thing that's really important when we think about this is that

576
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:08,885
There are definitely things, as we've sort of discussed already, that you can do on tabletop

577
00:33:08,905 --> 00:33:13,709
that you just can't emulate in digital, but also the other way around is very much true.

578
00:33:13,769 --> 00:33:19,694
Like if you look at what's going on in a typical CCG versus Marvel Snap, like there are just

579
00:33:19,734 --> 00:33:23,397
some mechanics that work better in digital that you would not really be able to emulate

580
00:33:23,878 --> 00:33:24,959
in a tabletop space.

581
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:30,784
But on the other hand, you know, as somebody who was initially, you know, designing tabletop

582
00:33:30,804 --> 00:33:31,164
games.

583
00:33:31,604 --> 00:33:34,625
back in 2006 when there weren't a lot of digital components,

584
00:33:35,165 --> 00:33:41,327
what I really learned in sort of like trying to create like Java apps to help with my,

585
00:33:41,567 --> 00:33:45,388
so that people could play my RPGs on IRC to let you know how old I am,

586
00:33:47,289 --> 00:33:52,250
is that the magic of a tabletop game is that when players are bought in

587
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:57,933
If you've missed something in your rules, sort of the social contract or the fact that

588
00:33:58,433 --> 00:34:03,816
human brains are sort of elastic and nimble, they can sort of, you know, glide over that.

589
00:34:03,956 --> 00:34:08,479
But if you, for example, forget to say what size dice to put in your game blowback,

590
00:34:08,539 --> 00:34:13,382
which definitely happened to me, if you try to emulate that in a computer,

591
00:34:13,522 --> 00:34:16,563
computer doesn't give a shit. Like, it will just break.

592
00:34:16,864 --> 00:34:19,765
And so I think one thing that's super useful about

593
00:34:20,306 --> 00:34:26,613
Getting more digital tools involved or trying to digitize parts of the tabletop game experience

594
00:34:26,633 --> 00:34:29,176
is that it makes you a much tighter designer.

595
00:34:29,236 --> 00:34:33,622
You have to make sure that everything is really buttoned up in a way that you can sort of

596
00:34:33,662 --> 00:34:35,945
get away with if you're not trying to make it digital.

597
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:43,039
Let me ask you really quickly, how do you integrate or even think about video content when you're making something?

598
00:34:43,059 --> 00:34:51,491
Do you consider that? Do you think about how maybe a tutorial might be used or how maybe you can utilize it within the course of your game itself?

599
00:34:53,078 --> 00:34:58,223
I think when we start thinking about incorporating digital content into board games, I think

600
00:34:58,383 --> 00:35:02,367
the most important thing is to think about how players are interacting with it and to

601
00:35:02,407 --> 00:35:07,011
make sure that it makes the game more accessible and more approachable in some way.

602
00:35:08,112 --> 00:35:14,318
The idea of just tossing in something digital because it feels trendy I think is really

603
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:15,719
frightening to me because that

604
00:35:16,152 --> 00:35:26,360
Takes away a lot of what makes board games magical and that is engaging with people around the table. Right? And so I think that's a heavy consideration.

605
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:38,769
Do you ever think we're going to get to a place where like VR or some other technology is going to allow for that intimacy still and be able to be digitized so that you'll be able to find that still but not be at the same table?

606
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:41,572
In my opinion? Yeah, absolutely not. Yeah.

607
00:35:41,752 --> 00:35:43,252
The physicality is so key.

608
00:35:43,452 --> 00:35:45,933
If you're not in the same room, it's not happening.

609
00:35:45,953 --> 00:35:50,355
I mean, you can have a valuable experience digitally, sure.

610
00:35:50,935 --> 00:35:53,436
But you're not going to have that same level of presence,

611
00:35:53,496 --> 00:35:55,437
that same level of human interaction

612
00:35:55,937 --> 00:35:57,438
as when you're sitting around the table,

613
00:35:57,858 --> 00:35:59,718
as when you're sharing cards, as when you're

614
00:35:59,758 --> 00:36:01,299
touching the same components.

615
00:36:01,339 --> 00:36:04,800
It is just such a core human experience to me

616
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,362
that no digital replacement is ever going to take over that.

617
00:36:08,382 --> 00:36:09,302
That's well said.

618
00:36:09,902 --> 00:36:11,043
Does anybody else want to jump in on that?

619
00:36:13,493 --> 00:36:14,194
I couldn't say it better.

620
00:36:14,634 --> 00:36:16,054
Oh yeah, no, I mean, neither could I.

621
00:36:16,414 --> 00:36:16,774
Well said.

622
00:36:17,554 --> 00:36:18,374
Okay, let's move on.

623
00:36:18,734 --> 00:36:22,195
This is again, you know, we've talked a little bit around this, but let's codify some of it.

624
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:27,436
What are some of the best lessons from the past four years that creators can carry into the future?

625
00:36:27,456 --> 00:36:30,457
Do you want to start, Cole?

626
00:36:31,317 --> 00:36:32,337
The last four years?

627
00:36:32,497 --> 00:36:34,738
Is this a pandemic question to Scott?

628
00:36:34,758 --> 00:36:35,338
This is a pandemic question.

629
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:38,318
Specifically, like we've already talked around it a little bit, but the idea that, you know,

630
00:36:38,338 --> 00:36:41,219
we have changed the way that we design, we've changed the way that games are made.

631
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:42,599
We've changed the way that games are made.

632
00:36:42,914 --> 00:36:46,556
Well, I mean, I'm going to kind of circle back to what I was saying earlier, which is,

633
00:36:46,576 --> 00:36:51,838
I think it's important to recognize that we're making games, we're making these objects,

634
00:36:51,938 --> 00:36:54,859
and we can think about the games as objects that we're selling.

635
00:36:54,879 --> 00:37:01,401
And the problem with that way of thinking is that after the game is sold, our relationship

636
00:37:01,421 --> 00:37:02,382
with the player ends.

637
00:37:02,822 --> 00:37:06,423
They've bought the house, they're the new owner, and they're not going to call us for

638
00:37:06,603 --> 00:37:07,144
plumbing advice.

639
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,368
I think that one of the things that I feel like I've had to really learn, and Root is

640
00:37:14,408 --> 00:37:20,179
a big part of this, is that players want a lot more from the publishers, and we should

641
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:20,680
think about...

642
00:37:21,655 --> 00:37:23,915
a continuing relationship with the player.

643
00:37:23,935 --> 00:37:27,496
And this doesn't just mean expansions and DLCs and other kinds of content.

644
00:37:27,576 --> 00:37:31,177
It means treating the game and the players who gather around it

645
00:37:31,357 --> 00:37:33,377
as sort of parts of a community.

646
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,537
And I don't mean community in a cynical way.

647
00:37:35,557 --> 00:37:39,578
I mean like an actual community that is oriented around a passion for something.

648
00:37:40,698 --> 00:37:43,979
One of the things about Root that I don't mention very often,

649
00:37:43,999 --> 00:37:46,600
but I guess I'll mention here because, you know, not that many people are watching.

650
00:37:47,353 --> 00:37:49,777
is that Root was not designed to be expanded at all.

651
00:37:50,277 --> 00:37:54,484
We built sort of four factions, and then we did really well on Kickstarter,

652
00:37:54,544 --> 00:37:56,667
and so we thought, OK, we'll figure out how to put two more in.

653
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:59,230
But we had no idea that we would ever expand the game.

654
00:37:59,968 --> 00:38:04,770
And at this point, it would probably cost someone about $300 to buy all of the expansion content for Root.

655
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:09,312
But we didn't build that content because we wanted to make that money.

656
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:12,853
We built the content because the community wanted us to support the game.

657
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:18,695
And so we realized that what Root was wasn't something that we got full control over,

658
00:38:18,795 --> 00:38:21,096
that it was something that we were negotiating with the audience.

659
00:38:21,156 --> 00:38:22,876
And so I think one of the big takeaways I've had,

660
00:38:22,896 --> 00:38:29,338
I just think that the pandemic made this clearer because it made the communities a little bit more graspable.

661
00:38:29,438 --> 00:38:29,778
Even though...

662
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:32,420
We weren't sharing the same kind of convention spaces with them.

663
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,122
I could see them on Discord playing the game.

664
00:38:34,442 --> 00:38:36,443
I could read their conversations in different forums.

665
00:38:36,804 --> 00:38:40,546
And I realized the games that we were making weren't just products that we were selling.

666
00:38:40,586 --> 00:38:42,588
They weren't just objects that we were creating internally.

667
00:38:42,928 --> 00:38:45,590
These were objects that people were gathering around and forming communities around.

668
00:38:45,804 --> 00:38:49,487
Yeah, you've mentioned Discord a couple of times now, and that's obviously been a tool that's helped you a lot.

669
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:52,850
Do you feel like the—and community's a loaded word, right?

670
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:56,934
But like, the groups that have formed there, the community input that you've gotten,

671
00:38:57,154 --> 00:39:00,557
do you think that that is something that in the future you're going to lean on more heavily than you have in the past?

672
00:39:00,777 --> 00:39:02,418
Yeah, well, we already do. I mean, we have...

673
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:07,293
Leader Games is oriented around the Woodland Warriors Discord, which is a wonderful place.

674
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:09,114
We sponsor all kinds of contests there.

675
00:39:09,394 --> 00:39:14,698
And we even design our games in such a way that we create kind of a new, smaller Discord

676
00:39:14,718 --> 00:39:15,678
to handle a lot of the testing.

677
00:39:15,698 --> 00:39:18,020
And then over the course of testing, we build that Discord up.

678
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:22,303
And then eventually it can launch its own community or just sort of re-merge with the

679
00:39:22,343 --> 00:39:22,783
main community.

680
00:39:22,803 --> 00:39:27,326
But it's something that we think about a community's engagement with the game basically in the

681
00:39:27,346 --> 00:39:30,688
very first design meetings where we're talking about the nature of the game.

682
00:39:31,476 --> 00:39:34,917
I don't want to talk too much about my group and my company, but we do have a group called

683
00:39:34,977 --> 00:39:39,838
Action Rangers, and we built them in as community managers, moderators, and playtesters.

684
00:39:40,338 --> 00:39:44,239
They use our Discord in a very similar way, where they become the experts on the game

685
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:49,900
for us, so that they're also able to self-regulate and help build and answer questions, even

686
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,721
when we're not able to.

687
00:39:50,741 --> 00:39:54,621
I mean, they beat us to most of the explanations about our own games before we can even get

688
00:39:54,661 --> 00:39:55,082
in there now.

689
00:39:56,538 --> 00:40:01,981
Well, I'll add one small thing about that, which is a lot of our community members will generate digital tools for supporting the games.

690
00:40:02,341 --> 00:40:05,643
We have a chance to do anything in one of those tools.

691
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:09,745
In the case of Oath, players would have frequently asked questions about cards.

692
00:40:09,765 --> 00:40:10,866
We would post them on our website.

693
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:20,645
And eventually a player built a fully searchable, wonderful card database that basically houses all of the different interactions with Oath's huge card base.

694
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:26,848
And they've even built that back into the tabletop simulator so that if you mouse over a card it'll start loading all the community answers.

695
00:40:27,369 --> 00:40:29,510
So these are people that you want to empower.

696
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:32,011
Yeah, absolutely. You never want to say no to enthusiasm.

697
00:40:32,302 --> 00:40:37,526
If I can riff a little bit on something you just said earlier, I think one of the biggest

698
00:40:37,606 --> 00:40:44,651
lessons from the last four years is that even though it has been a significant amount of

699
00:40:44,712 --> 00:40:49,175
time since the very first lockdown, I think for a lot of people, social interaction is

700
00:40:49,235 --> 00:40:50,456
still fairly fraught.

701
00:40:51,779 --> 00:40:58,847
And people are still reaching for not just their comfort TV shows or their comfort movies, but also like their comfort games.

702
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:03,391
And so I think you are going to see more of like the idea of...

703
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:10,423
Games as a service or expansions or sequels moving more into the tabletop realm because

704
00:41:10,883 --> 00:41:17,307
people are really, you know, having structured rules for social interaction takes away some

705
00:41:17,347 --> 00:41:22,591
of that anxiety about, you know, learning how to interact with people again.

706
00:41:23,331 --> 00:41:28,495
And I think reaching for a game that is familiar, that you already love, but is just a little

707
00:41:28,515 --> 00:41:29,095
bit deeper or...

708
00:41:29,875 --> 00:41:33,439
A sequel to that just makes that a little bit more comforting, I guess.

709
00:41:33,499 --> 00:41:37,283
I think people are getting really into like cozy games and that kind of thing.

710
00:41:37,323 --> 00:41:42,608
I think people just, yeah, they just want to be, want to feel comfortable with their friends.

711
00:41:42,988 --> 00:41:46,071
And that's not something that a lot of the last four years has given us.

712
00:41:46,372 --> 00:41:46,592
Yeah.

713
00:41:47,453 --> 00:42:05,365
If I can jump in, I totally agree with that and I feel like whether or not it's about, you know, developing community through expansions and continuing to support the same project, I think from, you know, from my perspective as a mass market designer, I'm thinking about how can I create approachable, accessible games to bring new people into the community.

714
00:42:05,725 --> 00:42:10,727
To introduce new people into this way of experiencing each other, of playing with each other, of building relationships.

715
00:42:11,187 --> 00:42:17,330
And that to me is something that, like, I think the pandemic, like I said earlier, like, that has introduced such a great need for that.

716
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:21,551
And also thinking about, like, can this game be played over a Discord call?

717
00:42:21,932 --> 00:42:26,293
Can this game be something that brings people together even if they're not in the same space?

718
00:42:27,194 --> 00:42:31,655
I think that that's something that's really important to be thinking about as a designer in this current age.

719
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:43,883
Do you feel like you have also found, like Cole had said earlier, that there's a desire for your games to be, not that they weren't before, but perhaps more organic and to be expandable and to have more built upon them?

720
00:42:44,177 --> 00:42:48,038
potentially i mean so again coming from mass market we're thinking about

721
00:42:48,378 --> 00:42:52,540
like what what is actually going to sell on the shelves at target or walmart and

722
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,260
frankly expansions don't

723
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,961
i mean if we're being honest so so it's less we're thinking less about

724
00:42:58,021 --> 00:42:59,442
necessarily expansions

725
00:42:59,902 --> 00:43:03,043
and more about how can we continue to support our players so

726
00:43:03,423 --> 00:43:06,124
for the game that i did uh... exploding kittens recipes for disaster

727
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:11,727
We gave you 130 cards and we gave you some recipes that we developed in-house and then

728
00:43:12,087 --> 00:43:13,068
blank recipe books.

729
00:43:13,588 --> 00:43:18,511
And what I mean by recipes is ways of mixing those cards together for unique experiences,

730
00:43:18,651 --> 00:43:20,012
unique ways to play the game.

731
00:43:20,529 --> 00:43:24,230
So we're encouraging our players to engage with our game in new ways,

732
00:43:24,631 --> 00:43:28,932
engage with each other, be creative, and explore game design on their own.

733
00:43:29,932 --> 00:43:32,733
And beyond that, for Hand to Hand Wombat, for example, we posted

734
00:43:33,174 --> 00:43:37,055
some different alternative gameplay modes that they could play online. We

735
00:43:37,095 --> 00:43:39,716
posted accessibility recommendations so that

736
00:43:39,756 --> 00:43:43,977
new people could approach the game from a perspective that a game

737
00:43:43,997 --> 00:43:48,479
designer would recommend. Things like that, I think, are really

738
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:54,565
viable ways of continued support for players without necessarily having to

739
00:43:54,645 --> 00:43:59,691
enter into the expansion space. Great. Ming, do you have anything that you would

740
00:43:59,731 --> 00:44:06,799
like to add? Yeah. One time I talked with one creator that's the CEO of the

741
00:44:06,879 --> 00:44:10,683
Armyscape. He also gave me some some opinion.

742
00:44:11,418 --> 00:44:16,762
Because the tip-top game is a kind of leisure that allow people to interact in person and

743
00:44:16,842 --> 00:44:19,204
away from technology in the information age.

744
00:44:19,864 --> 00:44:27,429
But some people, they are not social driving and prefer a quiet experience and less competition.

745
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:38,317
So he makes the product, the guy can play by himself, because they make the perfect

746
00:44:38,397 --> 00:44:38,838
products.

747
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:42,332
Finally, crafted single player products are necessary

748
00:44:42,372 --> 00:44:43,772
for this type of player.

749
00:44:44,553 --> 00:44:44,793
So,

750
00:44:47,954 --> 00:44:51,296
so they focused on improving the quality of the product

751
00:44:51,336 --> 00:44:53,597
by having detailed historical research

752
00:44:54,177 --> 00:44:56,939
and to add correct gameplay elements.

753
00:44:57,799 --> 00:45:01,561
So this allows players to gain a great sense of fulfillment

754
00:45:01,721 --> 00:45:02,941
and reward well-play.

755
00:45:03,462 --> 00:45:06,623
So starting with solo play and building off of that

756
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:08,364
into your multiplayer experiences?

757
00:45:08,779 --> 00:45:11,542
Yeah, it's the opposite way with the multiplier.

758
00:45:11,943 --> 00:45:12,163
Great.

759
00:45:13,004 --> 00:45:15,907
Well, listen, I only have one more question, and then I'm going to open it up to the floor.

760
00:45:15,947 --> 00:45:19,391
If you do have questions, you can start to line up at either of these microphones.

761
00:45:19,811 --> 00:45:22,474
I appreciate you bearing with me as I've asked these questions.

762
00:45:22,514 --> 00:45:26,358
I want to say right now that the panelists didn't have any idea what these questions

763
00:45:26,378 --> 00:45:28,160
were going to be, and they've done a phenomenal job.

764
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,403
So as you're lining up, can we give them a round of applause?

765
00:45:38,349 --> 00:45:42,091
Uh, yeah. Uh, the last thing I'm gonna ask, and I warned some of you about this one question,

766
00:45:42,171 --> 00:45:45,412
but if you were on a desert island and you could bring three games with you, what would they be?

767
00:45:45,912 --> 00:45:47,233
We'll start over here. Carol?

768
00:45:47,873 --> 00:45:51,334
Yeah. How many people are on the devil- the desert island with us?

769
00:45:51,454 --> 00:45:53,515
As many as you want. As many people, but only three games.

770
00:45:53,675 --> 00:45:56,096
Okay. A fake artist goes to New York.

771
00:45:57,852 --> 00:45:58,532
Consenticle.

772
00:46:00,353 --> 00:46:00,613
And...

773
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:04,875
A deck of cards.

774
00:46:05,075 --> 00:46:05,335
Okay.

775
00:46:05,355 --> 00:46:06,735
Yeah, that's a good answer, actually.

776
00:46:06,776 --> 00:46:08,016
That is a really good answer.

777
00:46:08,036 --> 00:46:08,536
Thank you.

778
00:46:08,556 --> 00:46:08,836
I do my best.

779
00:46:08,916 --> 00:46:09,517
It's like a mini-game.

780
00:46:09,537 --> 00:46:10,737
What do you think?

781
00:46:12,218 --> 00:46:14,599
There's an out-of-print board game that I love called Attica.

782
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,221
It's probably my favorite board game of all time.

783
00:46:19,561 --> 00:46:22,122
I'd say Sentinels of the Multiverse with every single expansion.

784
00:46:22,142 --> 00:46:22,462
That's a lot.

785
00:46:22,522 --> 00:46:23,343
And then I'd probably say Mon Cala.

786
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:23,543
I love it.

787
00:46:23,563 --> 00:46:23,743
I love it.

788
00:46:23,763 --> 00:46:23,943
I love it.

789
00:46:23,963 --> 00:46:24,143
I love it.

790
00:46:24,163 --> 00:46:24,343
I love it.

791
00:46:24,383 --> 00:46:24,563
I love it.

792
00:46:24,583 --> 00:46:24,763
I love it.

793
00:46:24,783 --> 00:46:24,963
I love it.

794
00:46:24,983 --> 00:46:25,164
I love it.

795
00:46:25,184 --> 00:46:25,364
I love it.

796
00:46:25,384 --> 00:46:25,584
I love it.

797
00:46:25,604 --> 00:46:25,784
I love it.

798
00:46:25,804 --> 00:46:25,984
I love it.

799
00:46:26,004 --> 00:46:26,324
I love it.

800
00:46:26,458 --> 00:46:28,059
Okay. What about you, Cole?

801
00:46:28,959 --> 00:46:29,479
Oh my goodness.

802
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:32,621
Alright. This answer would change daily.

803
00:46:32,741 --> 00:46:34,042
But at this moment,

804
00:46:34,562 --> 00:46:35,883
I would say a deck of cards,

805
00:46:36,243 --> 00:46:38,164
probably a copy of Blood on the Clock Tower,

806
00:46:38,344 --> 00:46:40,465
and maybe an obscure, not obscure,

807
00:46:40,505 --> 00:46:41,305
but a train game. 1817.

808
00:46:41,345 --> 00:46:41,966
Okay.

809
00:46:42,186 --> 00:46:46,088
And poker chips for the train game.

810
00:46:46,188 --> 00:46:47,869
Yeah, poker chips. You've got to have the poker chips.

811
00:46:48,569 --> 00:46:50,030
Ming, do you have games that you'd like to

812
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:51,090
name out?

813
00:46:52,551 --> 00:46:54,472
The game now, I'm like,

814
00:46:54,892 --> 00:46:55,012
it's...

815
00:46:56,961 --> 00:47:04,386
I already take the game today.

816
00:47:04,626 --> 00:47:05,727
Okay, you've got it right here.

817
00:47:05,947 --> 00:47:07,448
So you're already ready for your desert island.

818
00:47:07,468 --> 00:47:07,809
Yeah.

819
00:47:08,369 --> 00:47:10,791
Okay, let's go ahead and move over to some questions.

820
00:47:10,851 --> 00:47:11,692
We'll start over here.

821
00:47:11,832 --> 00:47:12,512
Would you like to start?

822
00:47:13,933 --> 00:47:15,875
I'm not really sure how to best ask this,

823
00:47:15,955 --> 00:47:19,657
but as we move through, you know, 10, 15 years from now

824
00:47:19,717 --> 00:47:20,438
where 3D printing is...

825
00:47:22,336 --> 00:47:29,280
Much cheaper and you know basically everyone under 30 has interacted with one in some meaningful way.

826
00:47:30,541 --> 00:47:40,667
Sort of business or design wise how can tabletop design kind of cope with that and utilize it, leverage it to create different experiences?

827
00:47:42,308 --> 00:47:48,592
We've started, we're having a real active conversation at our company about 3D printing because

828
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:51,374
what we're finding is that it's not worth

829
00:47:51,809 --> 00:47:58,516
the money and the time and the effort to design extremely good box inserts, because some fan

830
00:47:58,616 --> 00:48:00,518
is going to make one that is better.

831
00:48:00,739 --> 00:48:04,623
And they're going to post the STLs on Thingiverse or sell them.

832
00:48:05,163 --> 00:48:05,504
And so

833
00:48:07,399 --> 00:48:13,141
It's kind of meaning that for us, we move away from the auxiliary stuff, because rather

834
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:18,642
than making something calibrated for the ultra true fan, we know they're going to make their

835
00:48:18,682 --> 00:48:22,223
own bespoke solution to those problems, so we'll just focus on the things that they would

836
00:48:22,243 --> 00:48:22,943
have trouble making.

837
00:48:22,963 --> 00:48:23,824
That's great.

838
00:48:25,224 --> 00:48:26,124
All right.

839
00:48:26,464 --> 00:48:27,225
Thank you for the question.

840
00:48:28,262 --> 00:48:33,184
I will say, we had a fan that actually created an entire Discord bot for us for Alice's

841
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:36,965
Bissing, and we of course ended up paying them for the work and ingesting it into our

842
00:48:37,006 --> 00:48:41,067
full process, but it was incredible the amount of work that people are willing to put into

843
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:41,528
those things.

844
00:48:42,488 --> 00:48:43,488
What do you have for a question?

845
00:48:43,917 --> 00:48:48,578
Hi. So, picking up on some of the themes that you've been discussing this afternoon,

846
00:48:49,878 --> 00:48:56,399
post-pandemic in this more isolated world, I feel like 2022 was a bit of a watershed moment for solo

847
00:48:56,799 --> 00:49:03,421
gaming, games like Final Girl. And I feel very conflicted about this myself, because I do agree

848
00:49:03,481 --> 00:49:09,762
with the idea that in tabletop games, at least 50% of the components are the people. And the value

849
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:12,342
for me in tabletop gaming over digital gaming is...

850
00:49:12,882 --> 00:49:13,823
The social interaction.

851
00:49:14,463 --> 00:49:18,544
But on the other hand, I have friends now who have gotten deep into tabletop games,

852
00:49:19,004 --> 00:49:23,285
who were never interested before, but they've done so through solo games.

853
00:49:23,446 --> 00:49:25,246
So I just have an open question to all of you.

854
00:49:25,986 --> 00:49:29,587
Do you feel threatened by solo games?

855
00:49:29,607 --> 00:49:30,628
Do you feel like they're...

856
00:49:31,607 --> 00:49:34,952
If they can have an interaction with multiplayer games,

857
00:49:35,012 --> 00:49:38,257
how you design for solo versions of, for example,

858
00:49:38,277 --> 00:49:39,539
something like Exploding Kittens,

859
00:49:41,162 --> 00:49:42,724
is there a mass market appeal to that?

860
00:49:42,964 --> 00:49:45,088
Big, broad, open question, but just, yeah, solo games.

861
00:49:45,128 --> 00:49:45,568
How do you feel?

862
00:49:46,054 --> 00:49:48,096
Should visual novels feel threatened by books?

863
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:57,527
I think that while my practice with game design is fundamentally around human interaction,

864
00:49:58,027 --> 00:50:03,593
I think if you're designing a solo game, there are things that you can do, again, in a tabletop

865
00:50:03,613 --> 00:50:05,595
game that you can't do in a digital experience.

866
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:07,237
The tactility, I think, is great.

867
00:50:08,558 --> 00:50:18,065
There was a great game, oh I'm forgetting the name, by Kevin Allen Jr. way, way back in the early 2000s.

868
00:50:18,706 --> 00:50:24,390
I think it was called Sweet Agatha, where basically it was a book and it was a mystery and you sort of had to cut it apart

869
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:27,332
and put it back together to figure out what happened to Agatha.

870
00:50:27,853 --> 00:50:30,775
And I think there's something really magical about that.

871
00:50:32,042 --> 00:50:36,664
It's, you know, sometimes you want to have that kind of interesting tactile experience

872
00:50:36,704 --> 00:50:38,785
and you don't have other players.

873
00:50:38,985 --> 00:50:42,806
And I think, you know, there's nothing wrong with that as long as you're really thinking

874
00:50:42,866 --> 00:50:47,467
about what is this solo experience providing that you can't get in any other medium.

875
00:50:48,868 --> 00:50:49,088
Great.

876
00:50:49,108 --> 00:50:49,748
Thanks for the question.

877
00:50:49,768 --> 00:50:50,569
Do you want to add anything?

878
00:50:50,629 --> 00:50:55,490
I'll just add that, you know, solo games are played alone but experienced together.

879
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:55,850
Yeah.

880
00:50:55,870 --> 00:50:59,011
Because solo players love talking to each other about the experiences playing their

881
00:50:59,031 --> 00:50:59,271
games.

882
00:50:59,391 --> 00:51:00,932
And when they're in a real community, that means that.

883
00:51:00,952 --> 00:51:01,032
Yeah.

884
00:51:01,052 --> 00:51:01,212
I agree.

885
00:51:01,232 --> 00:51:01,392
I agree.

886
00:51:01,412 --> 00:51:01,572
I agree.

887
00:51:01,993 --> 00:51:07,540
Even for a game like John Company, a negotiation game, it was worth the time and the effort

888
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:12,387
to find a good solo designer to build a negotiating bot for that design, because the community

889
00:51:12,427 --> 00:51:13,248
is that organized.

890
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:15,190
Great.

891
00:51:15,491 --> 00:51:16,532
Let's take a question from over here.

892
00:51:18,126 --> 00:51:26,009
I'm a game developer, but I absolutely love playing board games, especially when I can get the friend group together.

893
00:51:26,929 --> 00:51:33,452
But because I'm a game developer, I'm not familiar with the design process for board games.

894
00:51:33,472 --> 00:51:37,773
So one of the things that you said that I found was very interesting was that you use tabletop simulator for prototyping.

895
00:51:37,793 --> 00:51:39,294
So I was curious what...

896
00:51:40,234 --> 00:51:44,295
If you think post-pandemic, if that will continue to be an important prototyping tool?

897
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:49,776
And if, what particular feature is the most important?

898
00:51:49,916 --> 00:51:54,337
And what doesn't it do that you wish it did or could do better?

899
00:51:55,597 --> 00:51:58,718
So I use it primarily at this point for viability testing,

900
00:51:59,678 --> 00:52:02,499
because player response is not going to be the same.

901
00:52:02,859 --> 00:52:06,320
They're processing so many more things when they're trying to figure out the software.

902
00:52:06,701 --> 00:52:08,222
They're trying to figure out how to interact.

903
00:52:08,262 --> 00:52:10,663
They're trying to understand why there are forks for hands.

904
00:52:11,204 --> 00:52:16,527
So, like, doing all of that makes the gameplay experience notably different.

905
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:21,690
And it's really, really important to do, you know, the tail end, the very least of your work.

906
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:22,870
So, it's a little bit of a challenge.

907
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:24,010
I think it's a good thing that we're

908
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:25,051
able to do this work in the physical space.

909
00:52:25,071 --> 00:52:28,232
But it has been great for rapid iteration and viability testing

910
00:52:28,412 --> 00:52:31,113
for, you know, identifying where's the fun factor, where do

911
00:52:31,153 --> 00:52:33,674
we dig into this, that sort of thing. And balancing, like,

912
00:52:33,694 --> 00:52:36,535
basic balancing type of stuff. It's so good for that.

913
00:52:39,415 --> 00:52:41,516
Great. Thanks for the question. Let's start with a question over

914
00:52:41,556 --> 00:52:41,896
here, please.

915
00:52:46,022 --> 00:52:51,703
I'm getting into the board game space, coming from the digital end of things, and I've been

916
00:52:51,723 --> 00:52:56,765
doing a lot of physical testing with playgroups and stuff like that, but as someone who doesn't

917
00:52:56,785 --> 00:53:02,827
have a huge following, what's the easiest way, or the various ways that you would recommend

918
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,727
to actually get a game onto shelves?

919
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:09,909
Because I have a game that's working, but it's like, how do I find the audience for

920
00:53:09,949 --> 00:53:10,289
that game?

921
00:53:10,329 --> 00:53:12,130
And maybe that's a longer question.

922
00:53:13,165 --> 00:53:14,507
I have an answer for this.

923
00:53:14,747 --> 00:53:15,928
So I'd say two things.

924
00:53:16,168 --> 00:53:18,851
One, look for other communities of designers.

925
00:53:20,232 --> 00:53:22,414
If you live in a city that has an active pro spiel scene,

926
00:53:22,554 --> 00:53:23,535
it's a great scene.

927
00:53:24,215 --> 00:53:25,797
One of the people, you know, there

928
00:53:25,817 --> 00:53:27,598
are a lot of designers who are in a similar place.

929
00:53:27,819 --> 00:53:29,680
And one thing you can all do to help each other

930
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,781
is to play each other's games.

931
00:53:31,582 --> 00:53:33,103
In terms of finding the right publisher,

932
00:53:33,524 --> 00:53:35,285
the biggest piece of advice I give to folks

933
00:53:35,365 --> 00:53:37,507
is that publishers are not here to grade your game,

934
00:53:38,088 --> 00:53:40,130
to say that this is an A-plus game, we'd love to publish it.

935
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:44,052
What's happening is that you have something you want, which is your game to be published,

936
00:53:44,092 --> 00:53:48,174
and the publisher is also looking for a successful game, and they have their own interests and

937
00:53:48,194 --> 00:53:52,216
market share and all these concerns, and if those two tumblers line up, then the game

938
00:53:52,256 --> 00:53:55,198
gets published, and if they don't line up, it doesn't mean anything's wrong with your

939
00:53:55,238 --> 00:53:56,479
game, it just means they didn't line up.

940
00:53:56,939 --> 00:53:59,080
So look for publishers that are doing work.

941
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:01,412
that is adjacent to what your game is doing.

942
00:54:01,932 --> 00:54:03,833
And think about your pitch to the publisher,

943
00:54:03,893 --> 00:54:05,995
not just this game's going to be the next Magic.

944
00:54:06,035 --> 00:54:06,975
Actually, don't tell them that

945
00:54:07,055 --> 00:54:09,757
because they'll stop listening to you.

946
00:54:09,777 --> 00:54:10,938
But what you can say is you can say,

947
00:54:10,978 --> 00:54:13,340
look, I saw the kinds of games that you're working on.

948
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,801
I think there's a little bit of a hole

949
00:54:15,141 --> 00:54:15,981
in what you're publishing,

950
00:54:16,022 --> 00:54:18,443
and I think this game would fit in that spot.

951
00:54:19,424 --> 00:54:20,064
That's great advice.

952
00:54:20,104 --> 00:54:21,825
I mean, it's apples and oranges, you know,

953
00:54:21,865 --> 00:54:23,887
when you pitch something and it just doesn't land.

954
00:54:23,907 --> 00:54:25,768
It doesn't necessarily mean that the game's not right

955
00:54:25,988 --> 00:54:27,669
somewhere, it's just not right with that publisher.

956
00:54:29,518 --> 00:54:30,699
All right, thanks for the question.

957
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:31,840
Over here, sir.

958
00:54:33,181 --> 00:54:37,685
Hi, so one thing that I'm seeing a bit with, for example,

959
00:54:37,805 --> 00:54:41,567
Mansions of Madness that ties in with a lot of the things

960
00:54:41,607 --> 00:54:44,069
that you have all been talking about today

961
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:49,513
is leveraging the tactile experience,

962
00:54:49,633 --> 00:54:51,935
but still providing for expandability

963
00:54:52,335 --> 00:54:55,258
in the digital through a digital medium.

964
00:54:57,279 --> 00:55:04,062
and how do you think, because I'm suspecting that this is going to become more common,

965
00:55:04,242 --> 00:55:05,882
it just makes a lot of business sense as well,

966
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:12,484
but when you have these communities that form around the game, like you're mentioning,

967
00:55:12,604 --> 00:55:17,486
and you also have potentially publishers that want to continue to capitalize on it,

968
00:55:18,378 --> 00:55:27,522
How do you feel about sort of retaining control of that core idea when you've provided more

969
00:55:27,562 --> 00:55:34,685
a tool set and the game is sort of infinitely expandable, or do you just not do that?

970
00:55:36,846 --> 00:55:37,707
Does anybody want to take that?

971
00:55:40,228 --> 00:55:41,108
You've got to let it go.

972
00:55:41,128 --> 00:55:46,531
I mean, when Root came out, we started getting fan factions about every week.

973
00:55:47,342 --> 00:55:51,887
And at first they were, to use a word used earlier today, curios, just kind of fun little

974
00:55:51,927 --> 00:55:52,227
things.

975
00:55:52,788 --> 00:55:56,432
And then there were 20, and then there were 50, and then there were hundreds of them.

976
00:55:57,212 --> 00:55:59,515
And we just sort of let it happen.

977
00:55:59,835 --> 00:56:02,438
And we actually tried to support our games.

978
00:56:02,698 --> 00:56:06,322
At Whirlygig, we actually put all of our games in the Creative Commons, which feels right

979
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:07,023
because many of them...

980
00:56:08,601 --> 00:56:13,363
use art that's in the public domain. So I want all the games, all the icons, everything,

981
00:56:13,403 --> 00:56:19,606
it's all in the Creative Commons. And we include very easy to disassemble kits for people who want to raid those files.

982
00:56:20,046 --> 00:56:27,009
And at Leader, we always build card templates, things like that, provide access to the community. We love sharing our files

983
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:31,712
because it's going to bring a lot more people into the tent than it's going to scare away.

984
00:56:32,824 --> 00:56:40,808
Yeah, I think that would be the one thing that I would suggest too, is developing creative tools that can also guide your players in the direction that you would like to see them go.

985
00:56:41,808 --> 00:56:49,972
Like I said, like about recipes for disaster, right? Like, we don't necessarily want our players developing their own cards because that can break the game in Exploding Kittens really, really quickly.

986
00:56:50,432 --> 00:56:57,675
But developing a recipe and assembling a handful of cards is a really fun way to explore and learn and grow with the game.

987
00:56:58,937 --> 00:57:05,349
So just as an example of ways that you can sort of help create some guardrails for your players.

988
00:57:06,471 --> 00:57:07,854
Great, thanks. Thanks for the question.

989
00:57:09,398 --> 00:57:15,821
Hi, I think today you've talked about digital tools such as Discord and Tabletop Simulator.

990
00:57:15,841 --> 00:57:22,764
And I'm wondering whether there are other digital tools that you have been using such as like

991
00:57:22,864 --> 00:57:32,809
tools for balancing game economy or say generative tools for like rapid prototyping.

992
00:57:34,349 --> 00:57:35,010
Does anyone want to take that?

993
00:57:36,325 --> 00:57:39,667
My favorite, although this is mostly used in the digital space,

994
00:57:39,727 --> 00:57:43,869
my favorite tool for modeling a player economy is something called machinations.

995
00:57:43,989 --> 00:57:44,189
Yes.

996
00:57:44,689 --> 00:57:46,210
Yes, it's so good.

997
00:57:47,331 --> 00:57:50,873
Basically, you put in all of your faucets and your sinks,

998
00:57:51,733 --> 00:57:56,415
and then you can simulate hundreds or thousands of rounds of play,

999
00:57:56,435 --> 00:57:59,417
and you can see where you need to tweak things,

1000
00:57:59,457 --> 00:58:02,519
and you can do that all in real time without having to get out any components.

1001
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:03,579
It's brilliant.

1002
00:58:04,502 --> 00:58:06,743
And my favorite, Google Spreadsheets.

1003
00:58:07,203 --> 00:58:07,403
Yes.

1004
00:58:08,064 --> 00:58:08,724
It's essential.

1005
00:58:09,324 --> 00:58:11,746
I use a fair bit of Python, actually,

1006
00:58:11,806 --> 00:58:15,668
if I'm working on any kind of event system

1007
00:58:15,688 --> 00:58:16,749
that I can build a model of.

1008
00:58:16,789 --> 00:58:18,630
I'll build it just with Python.

1009
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:20,131
And then more recently, I've started

1010
00:58:20,271 --> 00:58:23,813
using MC Dice, which is a Monte Carlo Dice simulator

1011
00:58:24,373 --> 00:58:25,774
developed by a person who's probably in this room.

1012
00:58:26,446 --> 00:58:33,588
And it is exceptionally good if you need to very quickly model anything that involves

1013
00:58:33,628 --> 00:58:36,248
different kinds of die rolling and things like that.

1014
00:58:36,268 --> 00:58:40,369
And I use this both when doing kind of preliminary design work, but also when we're actually

1015
00:58:40,389 --> 00:58:44,470
doing play tests after we run a particular combat, I will run it through the simulator

1016
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:46,890
and say, okay, how likely was what happened?

1017
00:58:48,131 --> 00:58:48,871
That's really smart.

1018
00:58:49,831 --> 00:58:51,151
Ming, do you have any tools that you use?

1019
00:58:51,871 --> 00:58:54,692
Yeah, the tool I use is when I play.

1020
00:58:57,018 --> 00:59:01,700
So we were mirror hosts because I played with my friends.

1021
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:06,062
I just create a room, my friends joined the room.

1022
00:59:06,082 --> 00:59:11,324
We wrote the character and then we played the game.

1023
00:59:11,624 --> 00:59:16,126
When I was on the evil side, I just said,

1024
00:59:16,186 --> 00:59:19,708
I'm a good person and I tapped the decision

1025
00:59:19,768 --> 00:59:22,129
with my partner, fantastic.

1026
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:25,171
So the voice and the text is quite different.

1027
00:59:25,411 --> 00:59:27,691
I think it's quite easier for us to play,

1028
00:59:28,652 --> 00:59:32,273
such as because in the past, we need to open the eye,

1029
00:59:32,573 --> 00:59:36,814
no words, just use the words, kill this guy,

1030
00:59:37,094 --> 00:59:38,254
or do the other things.

1031
00:59:39,015 --> 00:59:40,115
It's quite easy for us.

1032
00:59:40,935 --> 00:59:41,776
One last question here.

1033
00:59:43,956 --> 00:59:48,017
So this question is for Ming, specifically on Chinese market.

1034
00:59:49,058 --> 00:59:49,278
So.

1035
00:59:51,597 --> 00:59:57,358
under the current circumstance of the tightening up of publication number.

1036
00:59:59,349 --> 01:00:00,729
issued by the government.

1037
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:05,552
What do you see, and especially since you pointed out, it's very important

1038
01:00:06,012 --> 01:00:11,095
to have a combined force from all platforms to gain publicity of your game,

1039
01:00:11,215 --> 01:00:11,976
of your IP.

1040
01:00:13,096 --> 01:00:18,499
Usually it takes a lot of resource to do that, to pull that up successfully.

1041
01:00:18,579 --> 01:00:22,381
So what do you think, where do you see the future of indie

1042
01:00:22,782 --> 01:00:24,703
tabletop games developers?

1043
01:00:25,531 --> 01:00:28,976
in Chinese market in the next five years maybe.

1044
01:00:29,497 --> 01:00:29,677
Yeah.

1045
01:00:30,338 --> 01:00:34,864
In Chinese market, the most important I think is about the culture.

1046
01:00:35,505 --> 01:00:39,390
Like just this morning, the course says about the history.

1047
01:00:41,195 --> 01:00:45,959
We currently also have the script and products that come in with history elements.

1048
01:00:46,539 --> 01:00:51,083
Because based on this, more culture come in with the products.

1049
01:00:51,663 --> 01:00:56,747
Kind of like the Chinese famous culture, separates to the overseas.

1050
01:00:57,328 --> 01:01:01,451
As more and more people know about the Chinese culture and new products.

1051
01:01:01,931 --> 01:01:10,958
I think this during this part can make more people know the Chinese culture and then also for the Chinese person

1052
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:13,240
because like some children

1053
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:14,661
if you

1054
01:01:15,279 --> 01:01:17,800
If you ask them, listen, history,

1055
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:19,461
they think, oh, it's quite difficult.

1056
01:01:19,542 --> 01:01:20,142
I don't want to.

1057
01:01:20,622 --> 01:01:22,824
But you tell them this is a game.

1058
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:24,025
You are a player.

1059
01:01:24,505 --> 01:01:25,726
They want to play the game.

1060
01:01:26,146 --> 01:01:28,688
And during the play, they know the knowledge.

1061
01:01:29,368 --> 01:01:32,430
They learn the history and a lot of other things.

1062
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:36,133
It's a good way for them to education

1063
01:01:36,293 --> 01:01:37,193
or a lot of other things.

1064
01:01:38,622 --> 01:01:41,507
Amazing. We are out of time. I want to thank everybody for joining us.

1065
01:01:41,527 --> 01:01:44,853
And I want to thank the panelists, and you can too now by applauding for them, please.

1066
01:01:46,922 --> 01:01:48,303
I have all their information up here.

1067
01:01:48,323 --> 01:01:49,804
It's been up here for a little while.

1068
01:01:49,864 --> 01:01:53,207
If you take a photo, you'll be able to contact these folks across the internet.

1069
01:01:53,247 --> 01:01:55,930
Make sure to let them know on social media how you feel about this panel.

1070
01:01:56,310 --> 01:02:00,554
And I want to remind each and every one of you, you have the ability to fill out a survey.

1071
01:02:00,694 --> 01:02:03,677
If you like these panelists, if you like this panel, please fill it out.

1072
01:02:03,717 --> 01:02:05,218
It takes less than 30 seconds.

1073
01:02:05,278 --> 01:02:05,959
It helps us out.

1074
01:02:05,979 --> 01:02:07,020
It helps GDC out.

1075
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:08,261
It helps everybody out.

1076
01:02:08,281 --> 01:02:10,683
It helps you out so that you can have good content next year as well.

1077
01:02:11,264 --> 01:02:12,745
I want to thank every single one of these panelists.

1078
01:02:13,006 --> 01:02:14,707
They will be outside for a little while.

1079
01:02:14,828 --> 01:02:15,909
If you have further questions, they

1080
01:02:15,929 --> 01:02:17,290
may be there to follow up with you.

1081
01:02:17,731 --> 01:02:18,552
And thank you again.

1082
01:02:18,592 --> 01:02:19,272
Enjoy your GDC.
