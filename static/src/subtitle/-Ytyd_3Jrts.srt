1
00:00:06,016 --> 00:00:10,045
Alright, I'm gonna get started, uh, since we're about five minutes off now. Alright, so,

2
00:00:10,045 --> 00:00:14,435
like Tim said, uh, I'm Mike Junkerbluth, I work at Zenimax online, uh, currently we're

3
00:00:14,435 --> 00:00:16,199
finishing up Elder Scrolls online.

4
00:00:17,534 --> 00:00:23,495
And prior to ZeniMax, I've really worked at a handful of different studios on an assortment of

5
00:00:23,495 --> 00:00:29,297
different games. And it seems like at every studio, on every game, we seem to run into a

6
00:00:29,297 --> 00:00:33,478
similar problem. Which is, how can we essentially take all that great awesome stuff that

7
00:00:33,478 --> 00:00:37,618
Jalil was talking about, all that stuff about really studying a performance and figuring out

8
00:00:37,618 --> 00:00:42,840
what's unique to the character. How can we do that, not just on these main characters that

9
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,727
are featured on the covers, but actually to all those secondary NPC characters in the game

10
00:00:47,727 --> 00:00:51,392
that never seem to get the right amount of love, right?

11
00:00:52,313 --> 00:00:54,974
Of course the big reason why that doesn't seem to happen is

12
00:00:54,974 --> 00:00:57,174
what we always hear, right? There's not enough time, there's

13
00:00:57,174 --> 00:01:01,335
not enough resources, so unlike the main characters, which

14
00:01:01,335 --> 00:01:05,136
usually have defined traits and objectives that everyone on the

15
00:01:05,136 --> 00:01:09,717
team is aware of, NPCs often times are just a name on a page

16
00:01:09,717 --> 00:01:12,718
with maybe, at best, a short bio, some random abilities

17
00:01:12,718 --> 00:01:16,979
assigned to them, which of course leads to characters that

18
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,120
can feel generic, unrelated to the world, to each other or to

19
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,860
the player, right?

20
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:28,085
And to top it off, everyone on the team may actually have a different idea as to what

21
00:01:28,085 --> 00:01:32,609
any of those traits are for a character when they're implementing their aspect of the character

22
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:40,315
into the game, right? So, with so many characters and production time always limited, what we

23
00:01:40,315 --> 00:01:45,980
really need to do and what we want to do is create a dedicated process for creating an

24
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:50,304
ecology. Alright, so what do I mean when I say ecology?

25
00:01:50,991 --> 00:01:54,774
Well, the textbook definition is, it's the study of how

26
00:01:54,774 --> 00:01:57,976
organisms interact amongst their environment and one

27
00:01:57,976 --> 00:02:01,899
another. For our purposes and for the purposes of this talk,

28
00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:05,842
when I say ecology, what I mean is how a character fits into the

29
00:02:05,842 --> 00:02:10,566
world. So, what follows are some of the approaches I've been a

30
00:02:10,566 --> 00:02:13,749
part of on different games to try and do that, to create a

31
00:02:13,749 --> 00:02:15,890
process for establishing ecology.

32
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,932
Because most oftentimes a lot of these problems

33
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:23,534
actually become most glaring mid-production,

34
00:02:23,534 --> 00:02:25,695
they really are created to be adapted

35
00:02:25,695 --> 00:02:27,256
into any workflow at any point.

36
00:02:27,256 --> 00:02:29,878
But of course, like anything, the sooner

37
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:31,579
you can get these into the pipeline,

38
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:34,000
the sooner they're established, the more beneficial they'll be.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,482
All right, so the first step to create a process that

40
00:02:38,482 --> 00:02:42,145
allows you to find a character's personality as quickly

41
00:02:42,145 --> 00:02:43,866
as possible.

42
00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:45,246
The way to do that is, of course,

43
00:02:45,246 --> 00:02:46,707
with defining their objective.

44
00:02:47,978 --> 00:02:54,700
every single person in their life operates with some sort of objective, right? It could be that

45
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:59,802
the objective is enough money to, you know, to save up enough money to buy a house, that could

46
00:02:59,802 --> 00:03:08,184
be one. Or to be liked by someone in particular. Or simply just to survive. Whatever it is,

47
00:03:08,184 --> 00:03:14,807
without a provable and concrete objective, a character has no connection to their world and

48
00:03:14,807 --> 00:03:16,407
we're really unable to empathize with them.

49
00:03:17,776 --> 00:03:25,482
Oftentimes, the objective of an NPC is really simply defined as either impeding or helping

50
00:03:25,482 --> 00:03:33,009
the player, right? But we know that's way too broad for animation purposes and honestly

51
00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:38,713
it's even too mechanically shallow for designers, right? But oftentimes this is all we have

52
00:03:38,713 --> 00:03:42,997
to go on when we're given a new character. So let's start from there, right? If that's

53
00:03:42,997 --> 00:03:43,617
all you have...

54
00:03:44,745 --> 00:03:50,051
Let's get a universal touchstone that we can use to quickly establish a character's specific objective.

55
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:55,337
For my purposes, I like to use Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs,

56
00:03:55,337 --> 00:04:01,103
as it can quickly classify a character and give focused direction on how to brainstorm.

57
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:09,080
What each level of the pyramid depicts is the needs that drive the decisions and lifestyle

58
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,501
of the person living within it.

59
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:15,927
Everything below the level that they're at is already established to them.

60
00:04:15,927 --> 00:04:16,948
They don't even care about it.

61
00:04:16,948 --> 00:04:19,750
They don't have to worry about it anymore.

62
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:24,595
So essentially, how a character that functions within the esteem block...

63
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:30,184
right, which is focused primarily on respect, how they react to the world

64
00:04:30,184 --> 00:04:34,328
would be entirely different than someone in the physiological block

65
00:04:34,328 --> 00:04:38,932
who's driven by the bare essentials to survive. Alright, so let's see how this

66
00:04:38,932 --> 00:04:39,392
works.

67
00:04:39,392 --> 00:04:42,996
This is when I used it on Elder Scrolls Online.

68
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:48,633
So the problem was, we started with a graveyard that was full of skeletons.

69
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:55,301
And we were trying to figure out some animations we could give them to spice up the scene a little bit.

70
00:04:55,301 --> 00:05:02,308
But in a way that didn't make them seem like the normal undead zombie creatures you've seen a million times in a million games, right?

71
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:06,292
So I went to the hierarchy and I looked to see where they might fall.

72
00:05:06,292 --> 00:05:10,696
And it was pretty clear that they don't really have any physiological needs, right?

73
00:05:10,696 --> 00:05:15,320
Like they don't need to breathe or eat or drink or anything like that, right?

74
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,442
So then I move up to the next one, which is safety.

75
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:21,746
And instantly a lot more ideas came into what they could be doing.

76
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,663
The way I saw it, skeletons were essentially guardians, right?

77
00:05:26,663 --> 00:05:31,405
With a single focus in their actions, which was to protect this graveyard, right?

78
00:05:31,405 --> 00:05:38,629
They were essentially like the soldiers posted at the tomb of the unknown soldier at Arlington, Virginia.

79
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:43,392
And, you know, instantly, there's...

80
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:49,429
their whole purpose became a lot more clear, right? They didn't seem like zombies anymore,

81
00:05:49,429 --> 00:05:52,673
which exists really only on that physiological block, right?

82
00:05:52,673 --> 00:05:57,020
The need to eat, or being driven by that want to survive,

83
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,543
you know? And I think that's a big reason why when...

84
00:06:00,164 --> 00:06:06,049
you don't have something in place. Oftentimes, since physiological needs are the go-to behavior

85
00:06:06,049 --> 00:06:10,312
because they're so basic of what everyone understands, when you're not given time, that's

86
00:06:10,312 --> 00:06:14,936
where you're instantly going to oftentimes put characters and creatures and probably

87
00:06:14,936 --> 00:06:19,219
explains why zombies are so prevalent and easily successful in games, right? Because

88
00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:25,504
they match. But to take it even one step further and complete the undead holy trinity, uh,

89
00:06:26,492 --> 00:06:29,534
we can also define ghosts, which is important because we have a

90
00:06:29,534 --> 00:06:33,016
lot of those as well. Um, and those are above both safety and

91
00:06:33,016 --> 00:06:36,818
physiological needs and operate really only for emotional

92
00:06:36,818 --> 00:06:41,321
purposes. So they're driven by love and belonging as that's

93
00:06:41,321 --> 00:06:44,763
often the unfinished business that keeps them from passing on.

94
00:06:44,763 --> 00:06:48,986
So by using the hierarchy and simply identifying where all

95
00:06:48,986 --> 00:06:53,168
three of these token undead types fell, uh, they can feel

96
00:06:53,168 --> 00:06:55,650
unique to themselves but still be grounded within the same

97
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:55,870
world.

98
00:06:58,312 --> 00:07:00,233
But that's only the first step in this process.

99
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:03,814
Because oftentimes, even within those hierarchies,

100
00:07:03,814 --> 00:07:07,455
you're going to have overlap in specific defining traits.

101
00:07:07,455 --> 00:07:10,236
So to drill down even a bit further,

102
00:07:10,236 --> 00:07:13,116
but not lose their driving objective,

103
00:07:13,116 --> 00:07:16,037
rather than create that typical character lineup

104
00:07:16,037 --> 00:07:18,338
you've seen a million times, we had an idea

105
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:19,678
of why not try to line up the groups.

106
00:07:19,678 --> 00:07:22,679
And the way this came about was to fix an issue

107
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:26,440
we kept running into while doing R&D on Shadows of Mordor

108
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,240
at Monolith.

109
00:07:29,527 --> 00:07:35,071
See, how intelligent enemies were in regards to one another got really muddy and we were kind of

110
00:07:35,071 --> 00:07:39,815
in the weeds about how it should work. A sticking point that we kept getting hung up on was that

111
00:07:39,815 --> 00:07:45,860
while cave trolls are rather dumb, we wanted a version that was more intelligent. One that might

112
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,363
have been able to be trained and educated to actually command an army, not just be a wrecking

113
00:07:50,363 --> 00:07:52,745
ball that runs through it. And...

114
00:07:53,727 --> 00:07:58,630
While we wanted that, we still wanted to make sure that they maintained that core feeling of a troll, right?

115
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,251
So that they still had their objective.

116
00:08:00,251 --> 00:08:05,715
So when we tried to do a traditional lineup, that you've seen, where we thought everyone would belong,

117
00:08:05,715 --> 00:08:07,696
our opinions were all over the map.

118
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:09,598
So the idea of, you know, why not try lining up the groups?

119
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:15,992
So the way that works is, I started with enemies that were animals, and those were, you know,

120
00:08:15,992 --> 00:08:20,394
obviously easily grouped by their nature, as well as being primarily physiologically

121
00:08:20,394 --> 00:08:26,057
driven on the hierarchy, which is signified by their red bar. On one end of the lineup

122
00:08:26,057 --> 00:08:30,479
was spiders, right, they're not very intelligent, but on the other end was wards, which are

123
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,240
apparently quite intelligent creatures.

124
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:40,389
Then as more creatures needed to be added to the lineup, we can easily do so while still staying true to the needs of their hierarchy.

125
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:46,312
So if great eagles became enemies, they would go to the end of the block and push the wargs towards the middle.

126
00:08:46,312 --> 00:08:52,794
Then you bring in the next group. In this case, the root of our problems, which was the trolls.

127
00:08:52,794 --> 00:08:58,997
Again, you do the same as last time, but this time also line up the group in relation to the animals group.

128
00:08:59,755 --> 00:09:06,137
Here we can see that a warg would scoff at taking orders from a cave troll, but would

129
00:09:06,137 --> 00:09:10,618
certainly respect the commands of a more intelligent captain.

130
00:09:10,618 --> 00:09:13,219
On it goes, so we bring in the next group which is goblins.

131
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:18,700
They're much more communal, as you can see by being yellow, and driven by some basic

132
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,541
sociological needs on the hierarchy.

133
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:25,702
So while they are higher on it, they're clearly not much smarter than trolls, making it clear

134
00:09:25,702 --> 00:09:27,863
that they could be commanded by a trained troll.

135
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:33,203
bring in the orcs, who are driven by needs of respect,

136
00:09:33,203 --> 00:09:36,827
esteem, and achievement, yet intelligence-wise,

137
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:39,870
grunts could still be dumber than a troll or a goblin.

138
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:45,135
And then, as a reference point, the elves who just are way beyond everything else

139
00:09:45,135 --> 00:09:46,216
of those brutal creatures, right?

140
00:09:48,053 --> 00:09:53,216
So, while a standard lineup of characters can give you a lot of the same animation, or the

141
00:09:53,216 --> 00:09:59,459
same information, by grouping them you can quickly identify and modify the relation of key

142
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:04,141
traits while maintaining the consistency of their objective and needs, right? And if a new

143
00:10:04,141 --> 00:10:09,104
character is created for the game, it can quickly be added into the group without throwing the

144
00:10:09,104 --> 00:10:12,786
other groups and characters out of whack. So there, there it was, that's what we were missing.

145
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:16,007
Kind of a big picture that we could establish and maintain quite easily.

146
00:10:17,697 --> 00:10:24,638
like everything, that's not enough. And we needed to drill down even further. Specifically, we

147
00:10:24,638 --> 00:10:29,919
wanted to be able to quickly compare individual characters against one another. But the

148
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:35,800
answer to this one wasn't creative or methodical, actually it was very methodical and it

149
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,401
comes from math, right? It's a coordinate graph. So this one we didn't come up with on our

150
00:10:39,401 --> 00:10:44,102
own. I found this in Jesse Schell's The Art of Game Design. Who owns this book?

151
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,232
Awesome. Everyone in here should own it.

152
00:10:47,232 --> 00:10:49,774
Without a doubt, this is one of those game design books

153
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,795
that every animator should have on their shelf

154
00:10:51,795 --> 00:10:53,216
right next to the Illusional Life.

155
00:10:53,216 --> 00:10:56,398
Alright, so the way this works.

156
00:10:56,398 --> 00:10:59,340
You start by creating an axis

157
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,422
with two sets of binary traits on each end.

158
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,166
For our purposes, we needed to define how characters applied or modified the intelligence

159
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:15,753
within what we used in the groups, um, to one another. So we used sly to inept, wild to

160
00:11:15,753 --> 00:11:21,299
civil, and then on the second graph, uh, dominant to submissive and evil to good, as those

161
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:22,680
often seem to come up as well.

162
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:27,811
Then create a key with the characters you want.

163
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:30,253
Again, use the colors of the hierarchy.

164
00:11:30,253 --> 00:11:33,815
It helps to keep the needs and visual language consistent

165
00:11:33,815 --> 00:11:35,276
across all this stuff.

166
00:11:35,276 --> 00:11:37,738
We also added the player character as a reference point.

167
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:43,342
So to start, place a dot within the spectrum

168
00:11:43,342 --> 00:11:45,463
that represents each character on the game.

169
00:11:45,463 --> 00:11:50,547
So the warg is certainly wild, yet slightly sly.

170
00:11:50,547 --> 00:11:54,490
It's also rather evil and slightly dominant.

171
00:11:56,065 --> 00:11:57,566
And then on it goes with each character.

172
00:11:57,566 --> 00:12:00,909
And quickly you'll find how similar or unique

173
00:12:00,909 --> 00:12:01,529
your characters are.

174
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:05,472
If you find a few characters are plotting almost identically,

175
00:12:05,472 --> 00:12:09,635
then either move one to an open area of the charts,

176
00:12:09,635 --> 00:12:10,916
or if you need to, cut it.

177
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:14,699
Likewise, when a new character is being created,

178
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:16,900
you can easily see where an opening exists

179
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,362
for that specifically needed personality.

180
00:12:19,362 --> 00:12:22,724
So we needed somebody in like civil and inept, right?

181
00:12:22,724 --> 00:12:24,866
Maybe that would be a good buddy cop or I don't know.

182
00:12:26,422 --> 00:12:29,784
Lord of the Rings had buddy cops, right? I know the lore.

183
00:12:29,784 --> 00:12:36,347
Uh, uh, but in cases where characters are inherently rather similar to, to others in

184
00:12:36,347 --> 00:12:41,590
some ways, such as was the case with the orcs, they kind of were close to some others. You

185
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:46,632
can, uh, quickly compare one against the rest, uh, using coordinate graphs as well. Simply

186
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:52,415
place the character's dot in the center of the graph, like the orc in this instance.

187
00:12:54,335 --> 00:12:59,823
Then plot the other character's dots in relation to the specific traits of the orc.

188
00:12:59,823 --> 00:13:04,470
Instantly you'll see how they would behave if one another was in a scene with each other,

189
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:07,474
and how the social hierarchies would be established and actually play out.

190
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:14,944
Alright, so by this point, you'll know what their objective is, and how they would go

191
00:13:14,944 --> 00:13:18,165
about their life within the world to try and achieve it, right? You've got that base knowledge

192
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:24,167
kind of figured out. The last visual chart I like to use then is a path chart. And what

193
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:29,429
this does is, this will show how a character is meant to path throughout the world, so

194
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:35,151
when you deliver the animations to designers and world builders and audio people, their

195
00:13:35,151 --> 00:13:39,032
pathing is going to be consistent with the personality of the animations you created.

196
00:13:39,672 --> 00:13:44,714
So let's return to the skeletons and zombies of Elder Scrolls to show this in practice.

197
00:13:44,714 --> 00:13:52,637
So the skeleton which we established was like those militant-esque robot guardians, right?

198
00:13:52,637 --> 00:13:56,798
They would travel in like straight uninterrupted lines like you've seen in other games, right?

199
00:13:56,798 --> 00:14:03,721
And when they need to turn, right, they wouldn't just turn like this.

200
00:14:03,721 --> 00:14:06,922
You know, they're going to stop, turn.

201
00:14:08,024 --> 00:14:12,949
and then walk, right? That needs to be consistent with how they're actually moving in the animation.

202
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:20,276
Contrast this with how the zombies would move, right? And they stumble and lurch to their

203
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:26,703
destination. They're all over the place, right? I mean, it's, you know, it's like they're

204
00:14:26,703 --> 00:14:31,028
sensing that next bit of food that they want or they've even forgotten where it is they're

205
00:14:31,028 --> 00:14:31,128
going.

206
00:14:32,118 --> 00:14:34,999
And then when it turns, you know, it's not gonna turn like

207
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:38,301
that, that same robot, uh, skeleton. It's gonna, you know,

208
00:14:38,301 --> 00:14:42,883
it's gonna go way out and then come back in. Whatever. Make it

209
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:47,145
messy. Uh, right? I mean, these are, these are obviously the

210
00:14:47,145 --> 00:14:51,167
behaviours you're building already into the animation,

211
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:55,409
right? But if a zombie's given a path, like a skeleton, no matter

212
00:14:55,409 --> 00:14:59,651
how successful your animation, I mean, you got, if you got this

213
00:14:59,651 --> 00:15:01,212
and it's in a straight line.

214
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:07,153
That just, it feels at odds and it's not going to feel as good as if you actually paid attention to that pathing.

215
00:15:07,153 --> 00:15:13,886
Alright, so now that you've established and defined all these charts, right, for your purposes.

216
00:15:14,657 --> 00:15:23,799
You want to create a one sheet with all of these charts together that you can have to quickly remind yourself when you're coming back to a character or as you're working throughout it.

217
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:33,122
Not just for yourself though, but so that you can hand this off to other people working on it, because remember that's half the problem, is everyone might have a different opinion on how these characters should work in the game.

218
00:15:35,272 --> 00:15:36,792
And that's the beauty of these charts, right?

219
00:15:36,792 --> 00:15:39,694
Once everyone working on the characters

220
00:15:39,694 --> 00:15:42,916
knows the visual language that's established,

221
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,637
you can quickly refer to the one sheet

222
00:15:44,637 --> 00:15:48,780
and get all the information that's needed

223
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,661
without reading or, let's be honest, skimming, right?

224
00:15:51,661 --> 00:15:52,802
A giant, lengthy bio.

225
00:15:52,802 --> 00:15:56,424
Think of this as a visual, you know, TLDR.

226
00:15:56,424 --> 00:15:58,786
So, in the case of the goblins,

227
00:15:58,786 --> 00:16:00,847
by looking at their one sheet,

228
00:16:00,847 --> 00:16:03,088
we know they are highly communal.

229
00:16:03,993 --> 00:16:08,296
We can see how intelligent, submissive, and cruel they are in relation to one another.

230
00:16:08,296 --> 00:16:16,601
We can also see how they would move through spaces, often stopping to inspect the world

231
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:17,782
and others around them.

232
00:16:17,782 --> 00:16:23,026
And they're also aware or scared enough of other things in their ecosystem to always

233
00:16:23,026 --> 00:16:28,850
be looking ahead and turning or getting out of the way of others long before the movement

234
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:29,670
is actually required.

235
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,972
That should be enough to get everyone onto the same page in a flash.

236
00:16:34,972 --> 00:16:39,253
And if they really want more info, they can go back to that giant lore bio or whatever

237
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:41,734
if they really need it.

238
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,815
Okay, so that's the first half of ecology, right?

239
00:16:43,815 --> 00:16:45,655
How they interact with one another.

240
00:16:45,655 --> 00:16:51,737
But the second half is equally important, and that's how they interact with their environment.

241
00:16:51,737 --> 00:16:55,978
And for this, we refer to everyone's favorite principle, staging.

242
00:16:56,929 --> 00:17:02,794
It's one of those 12 principles that always is cited as being lost to game animation, right?

243
00:17:02,794 --> 00:17:05,016
But we know it really isn't lost.

244
00:17:05,016 --> 00:17:08,119
It's simply in the hands of other disciplines oftentimes.

245
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:12,043
So, level designers, world builders, content designers.

246
00:17:12,043 --> 00:17:17,248
Oftentimes, they're the ones in control of staging the character using your animations.

247
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:21,714
And they might even just have a giant large database

248
00:17:21,714 --> 00:17:23,337
that they're pulling animations from, right?

249
00:17:23,337 --> 00:17:24,859
That you don't necessarily have control over.

250
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:27,002
So it's important to empower them,

251
00:17:27,002 --> 00:17:28,785
to give them a pair of glasses

252
00:17:28,785 --> 00:17:31,369
that will allow them to see the world

253
00:17:31,369 --> 00:17:33,792
in the same way as you're trained Animator Eye.

254
00:17:36,258 --> 00:17:39,564
recommending books, writing docs, all that's fine first step.

255
00:17:39,564 --> 00:17:43,151
And honestly, they're pretty helpful for you because they allow you to get

256
00:17:43,151 --> 00:17:47,179
incredibly specific with the principles and explanations and put all your

257
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:48,562
thoughts in the paper in long form.

258
00:17:49,238 --> 00:17:53,762
But just like when we were defining the character's personality, and when we're given a bio,

259
00:17:53,762 --> 00:17:56,445
a wall of text isn't the end goal.

260
00:17:56,445 --> 00:18:01,911
And even if it is read, it's not really probably going to be returned to after that first viewing.

261
00:18:01,911 --> 00:18:07,917
So how can we make a more visual and quickly digested approach when we're talking to designers and other creators?

262
00:18:10,062 --> 00:18:18,790
Early on when I started at ZeniMax, a part of the group I was on was to help define and improve staging of areas within the game.

263
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:26,578
To get away from a wall of text, I took a screenshot, so this is a few years ago, and it was of the Mages Guild.

264
00:18:26,578 --> 00:18:32,303
And I asked the questions that I thought most important to the scene and the player.

265
00:18:32,303 --> 00:18:34,746
Who looks to be the most important person within the building?

266
00:18:35,827 --> 00:18:39,410
If I was going to ask someone here about joining the guild,

267
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,812
their name's the magister, who would that be?

268
00:18:41,812 --> 00:18:43,814
Which characters look to be trainers,

269
00:18:43,814 --> 00:18:45,215
and which character is the vendor?

270
00:18:45,215 --> 00:18:47,597
So in the big picture, I don't know if you can

271
00:18:47,597 --> 00:18:48,538
tell any of that stuff.

272
00:18:51,258 --> 00:18:55,179
Alright, so these are the answers, right? And there's a few issues here. First off, everyone's

273
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:59,540
really far away from you the moment you walk into the door, right? This is supposed to be a big

274
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:04,782
lived in place, but everyone's in the back. Worst of all is the magister, who's, you know, the

275
00:19:04,782 --> 00:19:09,863
admissions officer for all intents and purposes. And they're the front facing person of the

276
00:19:09,863 --> 00:19:14,565
guild, why are they back there? The vendor is appropriately behind the counter, but they're

277
00:19:14,565 --> 00:19:19,566
lost within the pillar and missing a perfect opportunity to be framed within the environment.

278
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,246
And the trainers aren't in places or postures

279
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:25,247
that would be associated with such a role.

280
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:28,889
So using my quick and dirty Photoshop skills,

281
00:19:28,889 --> 00:19:31,451
I restaged it so that they could see quickly

282
00:19:31,451 --> 00:19:32,491
how the scene could look better.

283
00:19:32,491 --> 00:19:37,814
So make it so that the moment the player enters the space,

284
00:19:37,814 --> 00:19:41,456
you break the room into three planes of foreground,

285
00:19:41,456 --> 00:19:43,637
middle ground, and background, with thought

286
00:19:43,637 --> 00:19:46,339
given to which characters the player would most often

287
00:19:46,339 --> 00:19:48,260
be interacting with when they're coming into the space.

288
00:19:48,886 --> 00:19:52,847
The magister is brought up front to greet visitors and talk to new prospects.

289
00:19:52,847 --> 00:19:57,849
The trainers are moved to the middle ground and given actions that are appropriate to their title.

290
00:19:57,849 --> 00:20:05,171
And the vendor is moved to be framed within the archway of the bookshelf, while still being behind the counter.

291
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:09,552
And a role that I thought was missing, that of a headmaster or person in charge,

292
00:20:09,552 --> 00:20:13,893
was put up on the walkway above, using the verticality to imply higher social standing.

293
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:18,175
So, with a few pictures, essentially eliminates a lot of a doc's need, right?

294
00:20:20,421 --> 00:20:24,083
But even that, they're going to see that and they'll go,

295
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:24,503
OK, how do I?

296
00:20:24,503 --> 00:20:25,464
I didn't know that stuff.

297
00:20:25,464 --> 00:20:26,504
How do I think about this stuff?

298
00:20:26,504 --> 00:20:28,405
How do I keep it in mind all the time?

299
00:20:28,405 --> 00:20:31,987
So what I wanted to do is give a cheat sheet that they can

300
00:20:31,987 --> 00:20:33,007
stick up at their desk for reference.

301
00:20:33,007 --> 00:20:35,669
You've gotten Post-it notes and all that stuff posted to

302
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:36,829
yours, they need something similar.

303
00:20:36,829 --> 00:20:39,691
So for our purposes, I broke that picture

304
00:20:39,691 --> 00:20:42,732
into a few sections.

305
00:20:42,732 --> 00:20:44,753
First up was finding the character's objective.

306
00:20:44,753 --> 00:20:46,274
What do they want?

307
00:20:46,274 --> 00:20:48,115
What actions reflect that?

308
00:20:48,115 --> 00:20:50,156
And what emotions are they feeling?

309
00:20:52,548 --> 00:20:58,532
And to answer that last question, I included visuals of the seven universal emotions.

310
00:20:58,532 --> 00:21:07,018
Not to mention having the faces on there adds some life to the page, as well as subtly influencing the person reading it to always be more aware of the mood of the scene.

311
00:21:07,018 --> 00:21:09,660
That's really important, keep that in mind like Julia was saying.

312
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:14,804
You need to think of what happened before and after and what they're actually feeling.

313
00:21:14,804 --> 00:21:16,185
Next, how do these characters fit together?

314
00:21:16,185 --> 00:21:19,788
What are the relationships and social hierarchies?

315
00:21:19,788 --> 00:21:21,009
Who's the star of the scene?

316
00:21:21,817 --> 00:21:23,877
where do they expect help or danger to come from?

317
00:21:23,877 --> 00:21:27,618
In all of these, right, it's that one sheet becomes important again,

318
00:21:27,618 --> 00:21:30,538
because a lot of that's defined for them already.

319
00:21:30,538 --> 00:21:35,860
But the characters, the NPCs, aren't the only ones in the scene,

320
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:39,820
and their reaction to the player, of course, needs to be taken into account,

321
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:44,341
as that's often either a direct help or hindrance in completing their objective.

322
00:21:44,341 --> 00:21:44,441
So...

323
00:21:46,008 --> 00:21:47,889
Are they expecting the player to arrive?

324
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,351
What were they doing before the player shows up?

325
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:52,573
And what do they want to do after the player leaves?

326
00:21:52,573 --> 00:21:57,717
And then finally, a reminder of the shot elements

327
00:21:57,717 --> 00:21:59,939
that were used within the example.

328
00:21:59,939 --> 00:22:02,821
Where is the primary entrance or exit of the scene?

329
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,963
Define the three planes and make use of framing devices

330
00:22:05,963 --> 00:22:08,285
within the environment.

331
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,946
In all of these little cheat sheets,

332
00:22:09,946 --> 00:22:12,628
I was conscious not to have more than three bullet points.

333
00:22:13,042 --> 00:22:16,990
Because honestly, at that point, people are just going to stop reading and you want something

334
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:21,079
they can quickly glance and hopefully internalize, right?

335
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:24,346
And then of course, the most important thing, when in doubt, act it out, right?

336
00:22:27,405 --> 00:22:31,166
So once you've got a doc and a one sheet and all that good stuff, you need to get it out there to

337
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:36,667
people as, as many ways as possible. Email, put it up on an internal directory, print it out and

338
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:41,308
give it to the people in each department, you know will evangelize it and really glom onto it.

339
00:22:41,308 --> 00:22:47,410
Hold a workshop that, that covers it and allows for Q&A. Sit down with people one on one to

340
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:52,731
help put it into practice. Relying on only one or two of these methods isn't going to cut it.

341
00:22:52,731 --> 00:22:53,931
I've tried and it fails every time.

342
00:22:56,818 --> 00:22:59,440
Okay, interactions between characters, check.

343
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,481
Their environment, check.

344
00:23:00,481 --> 00:23:03,422
The final piece of the puzzle

345
00:23:03,422 --> 00:23:06,244
and how this all informs their personality

346
00:23:06,244 --> 00:23:09,205
is specifically how they engage with the player,

347
00:23:09,205 --> 00:23:10,946
yet maintain their established ecology.

348
00:23:10,946 --> 00:23:14,729
Here's a story I imagine sounds like

349
00:23:14,729 --> 00:23:18,331
one that you may have experienced yourself.

350
00:23:18,331 --> 00:23:20,392
On Singularity, while many of the creatures

351
00:23:20,392 --> 00:23:23,273
had defined personality traits within their animations,

352
00:23:23,772 --> 00:23:28,718
all their gameplay and abilities seemed to boil down to really the same thing. Uh, they

353
00:23:28,718 --> 00:23:33,503
had a melee attack if you got close, a ranged projectile attack if you stood far and usually

354
00:23:33,503 --> 00:23:39,370
some sort of scream when they became aware of you. Making their combat match the personalities

355
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:43,054
we put within the animation was honestly something we were really struggling with.

356
00:23:44,102 --> 00:23:46,263
But when armed with what makes characters tick,

357
00:23:46,263 --> 00:23:50,085
there's actually a great tool inherent to the medium

358
00:23:50,085 --> 00:23:53,106
that we can use to help define and connect their gameplay

359
00:23:53,106 --> 00:23:54,547
with their personality.

360
00:23:54,547 --> 00:23:56,568
Remember when in doubt, act it out.

361
00:23:58,379 --> 00:23:59,560
I've got like one minute.

362
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,040
All right, let's go.

363
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,404
Our solution came from the game's multiplayer,

364
00:24:03,404 --> 00:24:04,986
which to give it a more unique spin,

365
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:07,989
had creatures as playable on one team

366
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:08,890
and soldiers on the other.

367
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,252
While originally we were worried it would force us

368
00:24:11,252 --> 00:24:13,575
to change the personalities we had established

369
00:24:13,575 --> 00:24:14,376
within our animations,

370
00:24:14,376 --> 00:24:16,578
actually once we took control of them,

371
00:24:16,578 --> 00:24:18,941
it was the gameplay weaknesses that came about

372
00:24:18,941 --> 00:24:21,003
because the animations had the personality.

373
00:24:21,203 --> 00:24:22,643
forcing ourselves to actually role play,

374
00:24:22,643 --> 00:24:24,564
to step into their shoes within the game,

375
00:24:24,564 --> 00:24:25,924
we knew what they wanted to do in a way

376
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:28,205
that just acting them out at our desk actually couldn't.

377
00:24:28,205 --> 00:24:30,405
So in the instance of the revert,

378
00:24:30,405 --> 00:24:34,006
which was that dreaded zombie affliction again,

379
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:36,547
we didn't know what to do for a long time.

380
00:24:36,547 --> 00:24:38,548
And while we had the personality

381
00:24:38,548 --> 00:24:40,968
of like a wounded animal that would have

382
00:24:40,968 --> 00:24:42,809
this interesting contrast of agony

383
00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:45,469
versus adrenaline emotionally,

384
00:24:45,469 --> 00:24:47,150
playing it actually helped us figure out

385
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,630
how it should actually attack and fight.

386
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:54,085
We wanted to make it a bit slower and pack a harder punch

387
00:24:54,085 --> 00:24:55,586
with a high tolerance for pain, right?

388
00:24:55,586 --> 00:24:57,988
Like a wounded animal, they don't necessarily feel that

389
00:24:57,988 --> 00:25:00,150
because they've got all this adrenaline going.

390
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:03,193
And we realized that we had this charge and rush attack

391
00:25:03,193 --> 00:25:04,854
that just wasn't appropriate.

392
00:25:04,854 --> 00:25:06,816
Honestly, they should force you to come to them.

393
00:25:07,775 --> 00:25:10,616
So we gave it a proximity mine, like a mucus thing,

394
00:25:10,616 --> 00:25:13,517
so it could corral soldiers into a desired location.

395
00:25:13,517 --> 00:25:17,158
It was given a medium-range vomit to blur their vision

396
00:25:17,158 --> 00:25:18,439
so they couldn't escape.

397
00:25:18,439 --> 00:25:20,680
And then a sonar-like ability to see through walls

398
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,940
and plan your ambush.

399
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,021
And just like that, the idea of a wounded animal

400
00:25:25,021 --> 00:25:27,102
really started to match the personality

401
00:25:27,102 --> 00:25:28,742
and the gameplay and the animation.

402
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,072
Alright, and that's really what it's about, right?

403
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,133
Like, role-playing, acting.

404
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:37,656
You know, we want to sit and we want to focus on that cool craft stuff that Jaleel was talking about.

405
00:25:37,656 --> 00:25:40,678
We want to sit there and think about these little tics and moments.

406
00:25:40,678 --> 00:25:44,900
But, oftentimes, we're not setting ourselves up to a point or given enough information

407
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,042
to be able to spend the time to think that, because we're having to define the space layer.

408
00:25:48,603 --> 00:25:51,364
the quicker you can come up with a system like this.

409
00:25:51,364 --> 00:25:52,745
Use this one, create your own, whatever.

410
00:25:52,745 --> 00:25:55,527
The quicker you're going to be able to get those core things

411
00:25:55,527 --> 00:25:57,768
of knowing who that character is out of the way,

412
00:25:57,768 --> 00:25:59,629
so then you can really take the time

413
00:25:59,629 --> 00:26:02,971
to figure out what makes them unique within themselves.

414
00:26:02,971 --> 00:26:04,372
Thank you.

415
00:26:04,372 --> 00:26:06,753
Thank you.

416
00:26:06,753 --> 00:26:08,674
I don't think there's a.

417
00:26:12,832 --> 00:26:19,878
I don't think we have time for questions, but that's my contact information on Twitter and email.

418
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:21,459
I'd love to talk to you guys about this.

419
00:26:21,459 --> 00:26:24,801
I think we're also going to have overflow Q&A today after 6 in an overflow room.

420
00:26:24,801 --> 00:26:25,862
We can figure that out.
