00:00:05,565 --> 00:00:07,466
Welcome to the Art of Journey. Thank you for coming.

2
00:00:08,347 --> 00:00:14,989
All right. Cool.

3
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,810
So, have any of you guys played Journey?

4
00:00:17,671 --> 00:00:19,872
Yeah? Right on. That's cool.

5
00:00:19,892 --> 00:00:24,394
All right. So, I'm Matt Nava. I was the art director on this game.

6
00:00:25,214 --> 00:00:27,855
I joined that game company on Flower,

7
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,896
and this game I was on from the very beginning.

8
00:00:31,935 --> 00:00:34,016
a really fun experience.

9
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,637
So today we're going to talk a little bit about

10
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:41,380
the kind of ideas behind the character,

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,441
creatures, landscapes, architecture,

12
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:44,541
and the sequences in the game,

13
00:00:46,142 --> 00:00:49,644
and how we got to the final look.

14
00:00:50,524 --> 00:00:52,045
So this is the character,

15
00:00:53,066 --> 00:00:56,187
as you know him, or her, or it.

16
00:00:58,408 --> 00:01:04,090
You might be surprised to know that one of the earliest drawings I did of this character actually looked like this.

17
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:06,430
Very different.

18
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:16,532
This drawing, the very beginning of the project, Genova and I talked about this idea of characters that could communicate without language.

19
00:01:17,032 --> 00:01:20,333
And so one of our first ideas was to have them communicate with their eyes only.

20
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:22,093
So I drew this character with big eyes.

21
00:01:22,713 --> 00:01:24,494
And that didn't work out, so...

22
00:01:28,193 --> 00:01:31,654
So we moved on and we had this idea of cloth in the world.

23
00:01:31,714 --> 00:01:36,116
So I drew a lot of drawings of these characters

24
00:01:36,617 --> 00:01:38,117
who had cloth all over them.

25
00:01:38,377 --> 00:01:41,459
And I really wanted the character to be dynamic

26
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:44,180
and jump around, so I drew them jumping around

27
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,681
and generally waving their cloth around.

28
00:01:48,382 --> 00:01:51,203
So this is kind of, in the very early stages,

29
00:01:51,243 --> 00:01:53,464
I did this color piece to kind of get a mood.

30
00:01:55,804 --> 00:02:02,069
feeling of the game. And this is a, one of the cloth-clad characters, and in the foreground

31
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:06,153
you see this kind of giant snake idea. So the snake, the floating snakes that you see

32
00:02:06,173 --> 00:02:13,640
in the game were kind of an idea from the very beginning. But the style kept changing,

33
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,462
and one day I drew this drawing.

34
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,142
which I think really set the tone of the game.

35
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,623
This was done in the first couple weeks of development

36
00:02:24,203 --> 00:02:27,165
and really kind of helped the team get a sense

37
00:02:27,245 --> 00:02:29,506
for the mood of the game we wanted to make.

38
00:02:29,907 --> 00:02:33,829
And the character on the left, the mask that he's wearing

39
00:02:33,929 --> 00:02:36,550
is kind of very similar to the final mask

40
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,051
that we ended up going with.

41
00:02:38,351 --> 00:02:39,352
So we took this character,

42
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:41,253
this is one of the first characters that we...

43
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:45,172
built in 3D and animated for the game,

44
00:02:45,192 --> 00:02:47,072
and you could actually run around in the game as this guy.

45
00:02:47,092 --> 00:02:49,493
He had like 25 animations or something,

46
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:51,594
so he could fly around and jump around

47
00:02:51,634 --> 00:02:52,594
and do all sorts of silly stuff.

48
00:02:53,034 --> 00:02:54,895
We also did a 2D prototype.

49
00:02:56,775 --> 00:02:58,316
So I did these guys, and they're super fun.

50
00:03:00,117 --> 00:03:01,457
Yeah, it used to be that you could change your color

51
00:03:01,937 --> 00:03:02,677
in the beginning of the game,

52
00:03:02,817 --> 00:03:04,538
because we thought that people needed to

53
00:03:05,198 --> 00:03:06,839
be able to tell each other apart via color,

54
00:03:07,779 --> 00:03:09,660
but that idea changed.

55
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,001
When we first,

56
00:03:14,232 --> 00:03:17,655
pitch this idea of this game to Sony. We made an animated trailer

57
00:03:17,995 --> 00:03:21,197
and it had this character and I'm gonna play that for you. So this is a very early

58
00:03:21,758 --> 00:03:24,219
version of how the game might have turned out.

59
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,021
Let's see if this works.

60
00:03:40,806 --> 00:03:41,287
Amen.

61
00:04:04,142 --> 00:04:04,602
You

62
00:04:37,012 --> 00:04:37,632
Thank you for watching!

63
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:25,137
So, you might notice that that music that was in that trailer is actually the exact same music that is in the first trailer that we actually announced the game with.

64
00:05:25,998 --> 00:05:32,701
Austin Wintory, the composer, he came up with the theme on the first day. It was kind of crazy. The guy's amazing.

65
00:05:33,102 --> 00:05:40,306
So, that trailer really helped us get the game started in terms of its design.

66
00:05:40,806 --> 00:05:41,286
And from there...

67
00:05:42,381 --> 00:05:45,962
I wanted to iterate on the character and make it better.

68
00:05:46,142 --> 00:05:49,404
And one thing I tried to do was add more detail.

69
00:05:49,524 --> 00:05:51,904
And it got more and more complex.

70
00:05:51,945 --> 00:05:54,245
And this character took a really long time to make.

71
00:05:54,285 --> 00:05:57,567
He actually had completely animated fingers and everything.

72
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:58,427
And it was really crazy.

73
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,368
He was in the game for one day.

74
00:06:01,568 --> 00:06:02,769
And then the programmers were like,

75
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,650
this is way too hard to make actually work.

76
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,850
So forget it.

77
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:11,776
So I actually had this drawing and this character

78
00:06:11,816 --> 00:06:12,997
that I made, I was like, oh my god,

79
00:06:13,017 --> 00:06:15,318
what if we put like 100 arms on him?

80
00:06:15,658 --> 00:06:19,520
And they were just like, no.

81
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,602
So I kind of had to go back to drawing board

82
00:06:23,843 --> 00:06:25,243
and I started thinking about flower

83
00:06:25,303 --> 00:06:29,025
and that game had basically like flower petals.

84
00:06:29,065 --> 00:06:30,226
That was what you played as.

85
00:06:30,246 --> 00:06:32,147
I was like, how do I make the character

86
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:33,848
for the next That Game Company game?

87
00:06:33,888 --> 00:06:34,828
It has to be more simple.

88
00:06:34,888 --> 00:06:38,010
So actually the next design was this version.

89
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:44,530
And this is where I started to think about removing anything that really wasn't necessary for the gameplay.

90
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:49,011
Gameplay at that point wasn't about climbing or anything with arms, so I took the arms off.

91
00:06:49,531 --> 00:06:50,331
It's all about walking.

92
00:06:52,092 --> 00:06:52,972
So he's got little feet.

93
00:06:53,712 --> 00:06:55,013
And eventually we took the feet off, too.

94
00:06:55,173 --> 00:06:58,173
And then I was like, well, what if we took off even more?

95
00:06:58,213 --> 00:07:00,494
So I took off the feet, as you can see on that drawing down there.

96
00:07:00,514 --> 00:07:01,694
And I took off the head.

97
00:07:02,635 --> 00:07:03,475
And then it was just a kite.

98
00:07:03,955 --> 00:07:06,495
And I was like, well, maybe that's a little too much.

99
00:07:10,258 --> 00:07:14,440
But that kite character actually did end up appearing in the game.

100
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,100
You see them in the desert, these kind of flying...

101
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,321
We call them the fish, but they were basically like these kind of cloth kites.

102
00:07:20,821 --> 00:07:23,662
So this kind of experimentation in removing even more

103
00:07:24,042 --> 00:07:28,624
actually was where that idea for those characters came.

104
00:07:29,204 --> 00:07:33,785
So, but eventually we realized we need to have this character

105
00:07:33,805 --> 00:07:37,026
use completely simulated cloth because...

106
00:07:37,786 --> 00:07:40,027
The previous characters were all joint-driven animation,

107
00:07:40,087 --> 00:07:42,488
and it was just like this looping, waving animation

108
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:43,569
on the cloth that looked really stiff.

109
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:48,211
So these drawings were done to kind of create

110
00:07:49,831 --> 00:07:51,532
an idea for how the character might go together

111
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:52,593
with a dynamic piece of cloth.

112
00:07:54,113 --> 00:07:55,854
And that's kind of the progression

113
00:07:56,314 --> 00:07:58,555
into how we got to our final guy.

114
00:07:58,575 --> 00:08:00,556
And here you can see him in his different states,

115
00:08:01,277 --> 00:08:02,397
painting all these different textures

116
00:08:02,517 --> 00:08:04,858
for when he's glowing, or when he's white,

117
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:05,779
or when he's freezing.

118
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:13,043
And so, here are kind of all the characters that were at one time playable in the game, I think.

119
00:08:13,444 --> 00:08:16,546
Except for that second to last one. He was never in the game, but...

120
00:08:17,327 --> 00:08:20,169
And that's kind of how the progression went. You can see how it got more and more complex,

121
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:26,855
and then it went back to this more simplified, iconic idea that we ended up going with.

122
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:30,598
So the next part I'm going to talk about is the creatures that you see in the game.

123
00:08:31,018 --> 00:08:31,759
And this is actually...

124
00:08:33,322 --> 00:08:39,467
from one of the tapestries that you see in one of the ancestor visions of one of these creatures.

125
00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:48,314
This is actually the very first drawing I did of what eventually became the kind of bad guys in Journey.

126
00:08:49,635 --> 00:08:52,217
This is one of the very first drawings I did for Journey at all.

127
00:08:52,558 --> 00:09:00,384
It was the very first drawing that had the concept of the slit of light that you walk into at the end of the game.

128
00:09:00,424 --> 00:09:00,925
You can see on the...

129
00:09:02,785 --> 00:09:06,147
far side that there's like this white vertical line, it's kind of confusing, but that's what it is.

130
00:09:06,768 --> 00:09:12,251
And the idea is that these floating scary things are kind of hunting you and there's like this idea of stealth gameplay.

131
00:09:14,313 --> 00:09:17,595
So yeah, the first ideas I had for these were these kind of organic sandworms.

132
00:09:18,715 --> 00:09:23,699
That's kind of cliche. For a long time we had this guy in the game.

133
00:09:23,739 --> 00:09:26,841
He was just kind of flying around in the sky. And I put these little funny eyeballs on him.

134
00:09:29,294 --> 00:09:35,737
We eventually figured out that if we wanted to make this interact with the player in the way that they do in the game,

135
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:42,041
we wouldn't be able to easily animate a character that was organic like this.

136
00:09:42,201 --> 00:09:46,964
So we actually decided to go with a segmented character because of that.

137
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:51,527
So I started thinking about what if they were kind of more like these robotic, sculptural...

138
00:09:52,395 --> 00:09:59,580
creatures. And this is one of the very first versions we had of what we call the guardians,

139
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,303
but they're also kind of like the stone dragon snakes that chase you.

140
00:10:06,285 --> 00:10:14,290
So we also tried creating this character out of cloth. And what we found was that the cloth

141
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:20,134
felt... it didn't feel scary. It felt good. So we actually decided to...

142
00:10:21,614 --> 00:10:23,736
make another character in the game that you run into.

143
00:10:24,336 --> 00:10:27,478
This guy, who uses the exact same technology

144
00:10:27,518 --> 00:10:28,899
as the ones that are frightening.

145
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,281
And you ride on him and he's super fun.

146
00:10:32,802 --> 00:10:36,884
So, that technology got reused for that, obviously.

147
00:10:37,325 --> 00:10:40,006
But one thing that was probably the most difficult thing

148
00:10:40,046 --> 00:10:42,368
to design for these bad guys was the face.

149
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:46,711
I wanted to have this very scary and memorable

150
00:10:48,032 --> 00:10:49,032
face to any bad guy.

151
00:10:51,511 --> 00:10:57,494
It took me a long time to come up with this, and the way that I came up with it was actually by doing this drawing here, which is kind of like...

152
00:10:58,494 --> 00:11:03,857
My idea was, well, what if your character you control was actually, you know, was this dark side?

153
00:11:03,877 --> 00:11:14,381
So I did this Cyclops kind of version, and that was really what guided me to the actual design that we went with for the bad guys.

154
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:18,843
And so here you can see kind of how they ended up.

155
00:11:19,338 --> 00:11:26,541
And they have two kind of states in the game where you see them as a sculptural form and then they turn alive, chase you.

156
00:11:27,342 --> 00:11:32,424
We had to make sure that they could do all of those things.

157
00:11:32,544 --> 00:11:34,185
So it was quite a challenging thing to design.

158
00:11:37,927 --> 00:11:39,528
Okay, so the landscapes of the game.

159
00:11:39,548 --> 00:11:45,371
This is actually a painting I did. I started this painting on Nintendo DS with Colors app.

160
00:11:45,391 --> 00:11:46,271
Anybody use that?

161
00:11:47,371 --> 00:11:48,772
No? It's really good. It's still my favorite.

162
00:11:49,648 --> 00:11:56,930
mobile painting app. Anyway, so the way we approached the landscapes and journey was

163
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:01,931
with this kind of color guide where the left side represents the beginning of the game

164
00:12:02,491 --> 00:12:06,632
and the right side represents the end. And on the top you can see this kind of very basic

165
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:11,293
idea of how the colors progress and then it becomes more and more complex as you look

166
00:12:11,413 --> 00:12:17,075
further down this diagram. And we actually stuck pretty close to these color diagrams.

167
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,831
We added a couple more sections later on,

168
00:12:21,313 --> 00:12:23,595
but you can really see how that affects the game

169
00:12:23,715 --> 00:12:25,456
in this early concept art that I did.

170
00:12:25,476 --> 00:12:28,719
This is basically a cross-section of the Journey World

171
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,263
and the colors that you would see there.

172
00:12:37,035 --> 00:12:39,476
This is a really early landscape painting I did.

173
00:12:39,716 --> 00:12:43,038
We were just at this time implementing the cloth technology.

174
00:12:43,318 --> 00:12:46,800
I wanted to figure out a way that we could have cloth in this landscape.

175
00:12:47,761 --> 00:12:55,305
Eventually this idea of these wooden flag posts, essentially, became the kind of stone

176
00:12:55,345 --> 00:12:58,666
gravestones you see everywhere in the game.

177
00:13:02,731 --> 00:13:04,793
And I was doing, on the early part of the project,

178
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:05,854
I was doing a lot of paintings.

179
00:13:05,874 --> 00:13:07,515
This is probably a little bit too dark to see here,

180
00:13:07,535 --> 00:13:09,657
but I was doing these paintings,

181
00:13:09,917 --> 00:13:18,364
and I was told to try and make these work in 3D.

182
00:13:18,504 --> 00:13:20,525
And so I tried to recreate this painting in 3D,

183
00:13:20,645 --> 00:13:22,547
and I kind of failed miserably.

184
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:26,110
And I really learned that we had to think,

185
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,991
approach the graphics completely differently.

186
00:13:28,972 --> 00:13:31,774
Couldn't use regular Lambert shaders and things

187
00:13:31,814 --> 00:13:32,055
for these.

188
00:13:32,944 --> 00:13:40,589
objects, we needed to really think about the 3D in a different way and think about how we can make it more like an illustration and less like a 3D graphic.

189
00:13:41,109 --> 00:13:57,419
And so this idea of this kind of cavern eventually turned into this area of the game that's really frightening and you can see that the way that it looks is much more atmospheric than the original designs.

190
00:14:01,445 --> 00:14:07,330
We did a lot of things where we would take screenshots of the game as it was, and I would paint over them.

191
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:11,313
This is actually a paint over of a screenshot of one of the first areas in the game,

192
00:14:12,474 --> 00:14:17,678
where I added these towers and these rocks and all sorts of things.

193
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:23,783
And then we tried to quantify the game to actually look like that, and this is how it turned out.

194
00:14:24,504 --> 00:14:25,584
You guys probably remember this part.

195
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:37,827
This level was pretty interesting. We wanted this sense of openness and happiness in the desert level,

196
00:14:38,387 --> 00:14:41,469
where players kind of, at this point in the game, know how to play the game,

197
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:44,911
and are meeting other people, and are having a lot of fun.

198
00:14:45,531 --> 00:14:51,434
And one thing that we did visually was we let the player see further.

199
00:14:51,514 --> 00:14:54,195
We pushed the fog back, and it's more clear.

200
00:14:54,215 --> 00:14:57,276
That kind of represents, in the journey across the game, if it's...

201
00:14:58,243 --> 00:15:02,406
clearer than it's kind of a place where you're supposed to feel more happy and if it's more

202
00:15:02,506 --> 00:15:10,630
dim and the fog is closer it becomes less happy and more scary. And I went for the sky

203
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:14,913
being green because I actually wanted to save the color blue for the last part of the game.

204
00:15:14,933 --> 00:15:20,396
I wanted that blue color to become a reward for players, kind of like a breath of fresh

205
00:15:20,456 --> 00:15:24,298
air. You never see any blue sky until that last area. So I was like, well, if I can't

206
00:15:24,338 --> 00:15:26,019
do blue, I'm just going to do green, I guess.

207
00:15:28,868 --> 00:15:32,489
So that's how that kind of worked out. This is a 3D prototype I did of that area.

208
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:37,431
And then, this is kind of how it ended up in the game.

209
00:15:41,092 --> 00:15:47,874
Here's another early 3D prototype I did for one of the early levels we had.

210
00:15:47,894 --> 00:15:53,675
We were going to have a level called the canyon where players would run around in a steep canyon.

211
00:15:54,295 --> 00:15:58,277
But it eventually turned into this area in the game.

212
00:15:59,397 --> 00:16:00,358
Quite a transformation.

213
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,721
The idea of the character sliding came in later,

214
00:16:04,101 --> 00:16:06,863
and we needed to have a cool level where you could slide around.

215
00:16:08,104 --> 00:16:11,087
So we changed the canyon level to be the sliding level.

216
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:17,472
One interesting thing is the evolution of the mountain itself,

217
00:16:17,612 --> 00:16:19,594
the iconic mountain that you're traveling towards in the game,

218
00:16:19,994 --> 00:16:24,138
was originally a cliff, not a mountain at all.

219
00:16:25,808 --> 00:16:33,812
In the very early days of the project, I was exploring this idea of having a very highly textured, painterly, kind of watercolor look to the game.

220
00:16:34,612 --> 00:16:36,693
We eventually realized that would be really hard to do well.

221
00:16:37,293 --> 00:16:41,275
So I later had an idea, well, what if we removed all texture?

222
00:16:42,676 --> 00:16:47,458
So I did this 3D mock-up of the mountain. You can see it's getting taller now.

223
00:16:49,936 --> 00:16:52,818
where I tried to emphasize flat shapes

224
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:56,800
and actually make the 3D space look as flat as I could.

225
00:16:59,501 --> 00:17:01,222
Give it more of an illustration look.

226
00:17:01,983 --> 00:17:04,084
And eventually, when we finished the game,

227
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:07,306
a little bit of that texture started to creep back in,

228
00:17:07,586 --> 00:17:09,367
and it became kind of this blend between

229
00:17:10,187 --> 00:17:13,509
my ideas about making this kind of flat 3D

230
00:17:14,149 --> 00:17:17,812
and also this idea of bringing in textural elements.

231
00:17:22,224 --> 00:17:23,605
So, I'll talk a little bit about the architecture.

232
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:29,547
So, this is one of the largest buildings in Journey that you climb.

233
00:17:30,407 --> 00:17:34,628
One of the early models started from this drawing.

234
00:17:35,729 --> 00:17:38,450
Everything in Journey started from about a million drawings.

235
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:42,231
I spent like a week straight scanning drawings to make the Art of Journey book.

236
00:17:44,472 --> 00:17:45,512
This is how it turned out in the game.

237
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:48,093
It had a lot of atmosphere and stuff you can actually see.

238
00:17:49,852 --> 00:17:51,492
I guess there's a sandstorm around the building and stuff.

239
00:17:51,592 --> 00:17:54,713
But this is not how the buildings looked originally.

240
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:57,534
Originally, I was doing a lot of studies

241
00:17:57,814 --> 00:18:01,696
of existing architecture from Greek and Roman design.

242
00:18:01,716 --> 00:18:04,757
I was really fascinated by this idea

243
00:18:04,877 --> 00:18:07,678
of a canon of architecture, of kind of a rule set

244
00:18:08,398 --> 00:18:11,379
that dictated how the buildings were designed back then.

245
00:18:11,419 --> 00:18:13,260
Everybody used the same proportions of the system

246
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,621
to make things look good.

247
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:19,062
So I took that idea and I made my own kind of structures

248
00:18:19,102 --> 00:18:19,362
with it.

249
00:18:19,717 --> 00:18:22,378
and then tried to incorporate the idea of Journey cloth

250
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:23,819
into it.

251
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:25,920
And eventually, I decided I really

252
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,061
needed to make my own canon of architecture

253
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:29,902
for this game, which was super fun.

254
00:18:30,922 --> 00:18:32,563
And this is another Nintendo DS drawing.

255
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,064
But it's very interesting because you

256
00:18:34,104 --> 00:18:36,585
can see that I started to think about these arches.

257
00:18:38,386 --> 00:18:42,147
And the arches in Journey are kind of memorable

258
00:18:42,227 --> 00:18:43,868
because they have this stair-step design here.

259
00:18:43,888 --> 00:18:46,229
You can see an arch that has like half stair-step and half.

260
00:18:47,757 --> 00:18:51,659
round arch, so it's kind of like when that idea formed.

261
00:18:52,439 --> 00:18:56,000
And here's a final building and a mock-up building,

262
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,481
and you can see kind of how they transitioned

263
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:00,662
in terms of architecture and style.

264
00:19:04,183 --> 00:19:07,904
So this is one area where the player is surfing

265
00:19:07,964 --> 00:19:09,265
and he flies out of a waterfall,

266
00:19:09,325 --> 00:19:11,745
and this is really cool because I got to really integrate

267
00:19:11,805 --> 00:19:13,606
the landscape with the architecture.

268
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:14,646
And this drawing,

269
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:22,681
actually ended up being almost exactly how it turned out in the game, which is kind of rare to nail it right on the spot like that.

270
00:19:22,701 --> 00:19:23,641
It's pretty cool.

271
00:19:24,741 --> 00:19:29,562
We also had a level that was basically this underground cavern, which I wanted to be completely architectural,

272
00:19:29,582 --> 00:19:36,083
and it was a very difficult task to figure out how to implement that.

273
00:19:36,123 --> 00:19:37,664
This is one early version of it.

274
00:19:38,604 --> 00:19:40,264
I did this painting of this tower.

275
00:19:41,724 --> 00:19:42,765
This is an underdrawing.

276
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:45,535
and then we have the painting I did.

277
00:19:46,616 --> 00:19:48,056
And this is one of the final levels

278
00:19:48,076 --> 00:19:49,356
where you're climbing this tower.

279
00:19:50,057 --> 00:19:51,397
And this painting is blue, right?

280
00:19:51,437 --> 00:19:54,718
It's like, it used to actually be the same level

281
00:19:54,838 --> 00:19:56,358
as the previous level, which is very blue.

282
00:19:56,418 --> 00:19:59,359
So in the very end, I decided I needed to change level color.

283
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:01,720
So it actually ended up like this in the game.

284
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,040
I swapped it to be orange,

285
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,141
and it kind of really was a good choice, I think,

286
00:20:06,181 --> 00:20:09,062
because that gave it more of a holy feel.

287
00:20:09,122 --> 00:20:10,783
It sort of became like this temple.

288
00:20:11,423 --> 00:20:12,783
And it kind of worked with the music

289
00:20:12,803 --> 00:20:13,423
and everything like that.

290
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:17,549
The final area of Journey had this bridge.

291
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:20,190
I wanted to have this very scary bridge.

292
00:20:22,091 --> 00:20:24,152
So I did this painting of it.

293
00:20:26,093 --> 00:20:28,154
And then this is kind of how it turned out in the game.

294
00:20:28,535 --> 00:20:30,556
This is one of the most punishing moments in Journey

295
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,317
if you fall off this thing, because you

296
00:20:32,337 --> 00:20:33,557
have to walk all the way back around.

297
00:20:33,597 --> 00:20:34,698
It's really bad.

298
00:20:35,018 --> 00:20:36,119
And you used to be able to fall off

299
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:40,701
of these buildings, which would have been so punishing.

300
00:20:42,337 --> 00:20:43,658
So we decided to change that.

301
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:46,860
But there you can see some of the preliminary drawings I did

302
00:20:46,981 --> 00:20:51,143
for the very final architecture you see in the snow level.

303
00:20:54,966 --> 00:20:57,528
Which contrasts heavily with the architecture you see

304
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,349
in the very final level, which is very spare.

305
00:20:59,369 --> 00:21:00,190
You don't see a lot of it.

306
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:03,412
But I took inspiration from the Japanese Torii gate,

307
00:21:04,032 --> 00:21:05,353
which is kind of, in the Shinto religion,

308
00:21:05,413 --> 00:21:08,496
it represents kind of where the sacred space

309
00:21:08,596 --> 00:21:10,497
is delineated from profane space.

310
00:21:10,597 --> 00:21:11,558
And I wanted to have.

311
00:21:12,258 --> 00:21:14,319
This final level had this very dreamlike quality

312
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:16,620
where you would feel like you were

313
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,601
in a very magical and spiritual zone.

314
00:21:18,741 --> 00:21:20,562
So I put this kind of architecture in there

315
00:21:20,622 --> 00:21:22,283
to reinforce that idea.

316
00:21:25,464 --> 00:21:27,646
So the last part I'm going to talk about is sequences.

317
00:21:28,506 --> 00:21:31,387
So in Journey, I did a lot of storyboard drawings.

318
00:21:31,508 --> 00:21:37,110
So this is storyboard drawing for the part

319
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,972
where you wake up and you blast off into the clouds.

320
00:21:43,662 --> 00:21:45,163
We did a lot of storyboards for the gameplay.

321
00:21:45,183 --> 00:21:47,724
We also did a lot of storyboards for the ancestors.

322
00:21:47,825 --> 00:21:50,906
We call them the ancestors that you see at each level.

323
00:21:50,946 --> 00:21:53,067
And the game didn't actually always have these characters.

324
00:21:53,468 --> 00:21:56,389
We put them in because players didn't really

325
00:21:56,429 --> 00:21:59,571
know when the level ended without them,

326
00:21:59,691 --> 00:22:02,353
and they didn't really have a sense of completion

327
00:22:02,393 --> 00:22:04,894
without some sort of storytelling

328
00:22:04,934 --> 00:22:06,135
at the end of each level, some sort of.

329
00:22:06,602 --> 00:22:08,924
feeling that they understand the space a little bit more.

330
00:22:09,004 --> 00:22:12,226
So my first idea, this is one of the very early ideas

331
00:22:12,246 --> 00:22:13,587
for how this character would appear.

332
00:22:13,607 --> 00:22:15,469
He would kind of materialize in the air.

333
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,472
And it was really, really weird.

334
00:22:18,512 --> 00:22:20,213
So I have this kind of old footage of the game.

335
00:22:21,454 --> 00:22:24,136
You can kind of hear Jenova snickering about it, I think.

336
00:22:24,737 --> 00:22:26,318
So basically, this is one of the early versions

337
00:22:26,358 --> 00:22:27,539
of these ancestor interactions.

338
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,020
You see two guys kind of like.

339
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:33,411
overlapping because there's no code at that point to tell them to not sit around and talk to each other.

340
00:22:34,032 --> 00:22:37,073
And what he does is he just kind of comes out and then he flies away.

341
00:22:38,613 --> 00:22:41,074
And it's really awkward and you can kind of see up his skirt and

342
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:45,155
then he just like disappears. It's like, oh great.

343
00:22:45,255 --> 00:22:47,596
Okay, what was that about?

344
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:51,997
So we had to change that. They just didn't seem meaningful at all.

345
00:22:52,157 --> 00:22:55,958
And you can see that the game was really ugly back then.

346
00:22:57,672 --> 00:23:01,893
So I was like, okay, well, how can they leave in a way that is not so weird?

347
00:23:02,313 --> 00:23:07,934
So my next idea was like, okay, so I did this painting, and I was like, well, what if they, like, just totally explode?

348
00:23:08,734 --> 00:23:13,275
And, um, like that, you know?

349
00:23:13,295 --> 00:23:15,516
It's like, well, no, that's not really good either, so.

350
00:23:16,256 --> 00:23:20,817
Um, it kind of put that problem off, and I started to think about, um...

351
00:23:22,592 --> 00:23:23,392
what they were going to say.

352
00:23:23,972 --> 00:23:26,213
And so we wanted to communicate without language.

353
00:23:26,633 --> 00:23:28,574
So I started doing these designs for these kind of

354
00:23:28,634 --> 00:23:29,994
hieroglyphs that they would show you

355
00:23:30,054 --> 00:23:31,155
the kind of history of the world with.

356
00:23:31,915 --> 00:23:34,716
And I instantly was told this is too high resolution.

357
00:23:34,736 --> 00:23:40,278
We can't do that many images, so try a 128 by 64 texture.

358
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:41,258
Okay?

359
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:42,979
And so we tried to do that.

360
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:48,140
So these images eventually became scattered

361
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,281
throughout the world and you see

362
00:23:52,888 --> 00:24:03,891
little secrets. And I also created this really long image that kind of goes from left to right. You kind of uncover throughout the game.

363
00:24:04,371 --> 00:24:17,774
You can see some details of it here. And it kind of tells you the back story of the game. So the ancestors had something meaningful to present.

364
00:24:18,254 --> 00:24:21,355
And the final thing that we figured out what the ancestor was.

365
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:24,937
they just can't be in the same world as you.

366
00:24:25,037 --> 00:24:28,059
So the player actually enters this kind of trance,

367
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,280
or vision, and they see the ancestor,

368
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,102
and then when they wake up, the ancestor disappears.

369
00:24:32,162 --> 00:24:33,963
So then, that way you didn't have to fly away,

370
00:24:34,023 --> 00:24:34,784
or explode, or anything.

371
00:24:34,924 --> 00:24:36,685
It just kind of worked a lot better.

372
00:24:36,705 --> 00:24:39,507
So that was good.

373
00:24:39,847 --> 00:24:42,669
Very ending of the game, I had this storyboard

374
00:24:42,749 --> 00:24:46,352
for this guy who kind of like, walks and touches this light,

375
00:24:47,032 --> 00:24:49,294
and there's like one frame where you can kind of see his hand.

376
00:24:50,047 --> 00:24:52,808
touching the light and it was like the TGC logo and I thought that was really cool.

377
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,831
But eventually what we found was that the players

378
00:24:57,111 --> 00:25:00,614
really didn't want a cutscene at the end. They wanted to be able to control the

379
00:25:00,654 --> 00:25:01,594
character all the way

380
00:25:02,175 --> 00:25:04,957
to the end and so we actually removed the entire sequence

381
00:25:05,057 --> 00:25:07,859
and it became much more meaningful for players.

382
00:25:08,439 --> 00:25:11,281
So that's kind of how the ending

383
00:25:11,541 --> 00:25:16,365
turned out. So yeah, that's kind of...

384
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:20,540
my talk, we started with a lot of drawings like this,

385
00:25:21,241 --> 00:25:23,081
and then we did a lot of prototypes like this,

386
00:25:24,561 --> 00:25:26,882
and after a lot of iteration, we finally

387
00:25:27,042 --> 00:25:30,103
kinda came to the final art of Journey.

388
00:25:31,643 --> 00:25:33,244
So, thank you very much.

389
00:25:34,964 --> 00:25:35,504
Thank you.

390
00:25:35,524 --> 00:25:36,144
Thank you.

391
00:25:36,184 --> 00:25:36,784
Thank you.

392
00:25:36,804 --> 00:25:37,525
Thank you.

393
00:25:37,705 --> 00:25:38,325
Thank you.

394
00:25:38,365 --> 00:25:39,145
Thank you.

395
00:25:39,465 --> 00:25:40,325
Thank you.

396
00:25:40,345 --> 00:25:40,565
Thank you.

397
00:25:46,638 --> 00:25:48,219
So if you have any questions or anything,

398
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:50,640
also, there's an art book that I made about the book.

399
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,261
And it has a lot more pictures if you're interested.

400
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:54,442
And also, I just started a company.

401
00:25:54,542 --> 00:25:58,565
So if you're an engineer, you want a job, come talk to me.

402
00:25:58,985 --> 00:26:00,526
But yeah, if you want to ask questions,

403
00:26:00,546 --> 00:26:01,406
we have time for questions, I think.

404
00:26:03,247 --> 00:26:04,628
OK, so I'll be out in the hallway

405
00:26:04,648 --> 00:26:05,288
if you have any questions.

406
00:26:06,049 --> 00:26:06,249
Thank you.
