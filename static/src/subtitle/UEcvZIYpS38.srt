1
00:00:03,869 --> 00:00:04,269
Let's do it.

2
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:04,950
There we go.

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:05,571
All right.

4
00:00:05,891 --> 00:00:07,453
We're going to get going, guys.

5
00:00:07,473 --> 00:00:07,513
Hi.

6
00:00:08,094 --> 00:00:08,835
Thanks for coming out.

7
00:00:12,069 --> 00:00:17,271
So we are here to talk about making mixed reality trailers and live streams.

8
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:23,554
So before we dive into the meat of this, we'll just give you a real quick background on who we are and why we're up in front of you talking today.

9
00:00:24,114 --> 00:00:30,437
So I am from the middle of nowhere in Canada, called Winnipeg, and Colin is from a wonderful, beautiful city called Vancouver.

10
00:00:31,038 --> 00:00:37,541
And Colin spent about five years sort of traveling the world and making games and doing wonderful things and exploring awesome places.

11
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:40,725
On his travels he made a game called Incredipede, which is really cool.

12
00:00:40,945 --> 00:00:44,230
And way back before that, he made the 2D version of Fantastic Contraption.

13
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,953
And then decided to come back to Vancouver.

14
00:00:47,234 --> 00:00:48,515
And VR was amazing.

15
00:00:48,635 --> 00:00:52,601
And then decided to make the virtual reality version of Fantastic Contraption, which we're going to talk about today.

16
00:00:53,502 --> 00:01:00,426
For myself, I spent about 8 years in the visual effects industry working on about 25 or so B to C grade Hollywood movies.

17
00:01:00,486 --> 00:01:04,008
They were all pretty bad except for maybe Chum Scrubber. That one was kind of okay.

18
00:01:05,128 --> 00:01:07,930
But basically, you know, I decided to try to get into something different.

19
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:12,693
And to make a really long story short, I now make indie game trailers full-time, which is like crazy.

20
00:01:13,513 --> 00:01:15,134
And thanks! Yay!

21
00:01:15,434 --> 00:01:17,795
Which led me to the creation of these two trailers.

22
00:01:18,196 --> 00:01:21,417
Now, just due to the time, we're just only going to be talking about Contraption today.

23
00:01:22,238 --> 00:01:40,943
But basically what ended up happening is calling in about January of last year before the vibe was launched. He's like hey Kurt. You want to try to make in this virtual reality fantastic attraction trip. Yes, I am so on board with that and so Devin Reimer who worked with alchemy was just outside of Winnipeg at the time before he moved down to Austin and I knew they were working on jobs him.

24
00:01:41,484 --> 00:01:45,048
And what we decided to do was shoot both of these trailers at the exact same time.

25
00:01:45,488 --> 00:01:49,613
And when I said yes to this, I actually had no idea that they were going to be the two launch trailers,

26
00:01:49,633 --> 00:01:53,478
or two of the three launch games for the Vive 2, so yeah, pressure was on, so to speak.

27
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:59,204
So, before we look at the Contraption trailer and what we did, I just want to talk really briefly about VR,

28
00:01:59,404 --> 00:02:00,686
and it has this like awful...

29
00:02:00,766 --> 00:02:05,609
communications for a problem right now it's really really hard to explain what

30
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:09,551
it's like to be inside a virtual reality and obviously everyone remembers the

31
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:13,373
cover of time it was endlessly mocked and these are actual stock images that

32
00:02:13,413 --> 00:02:17,456
you can pay money for you can you you want that in your PowerPoint you can you

33
00:02:17,476 --> 00:02:21,838
can get that so but yeah it's like you're in this 360 world where you can

34
00:02:21,858 --> 00:02:24,780
touch things and move around interact with stuff and it's absolutely amazing

35
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,321
and it's so not whatever that is right

36
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:31,004
So we were like, how do we communicate this awesomeness of VR?

37
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:34,006
So at the time, we kind of looked at what everybody else was doing.

38
00:02:34,586 --> 00:02:36,387
And when the Oculus first came out, everyone

39
00:02:36,427 --> 00:02:38,509
was doing these dual fisheye views, because that

40
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:39,790
was the raw output you got.

41
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,811
And it was really just the easiest thing to do.

42
00:02:42,251 --> 00:02:43,392
But it is awful.

43
00:02:43,492 --> 00:02:44,433
Why would you release that?

44
00:02:44,473 --> 00:02:46,274
That makes everything you're doing look so bad.

45
00:02:46,714 --> 00:02:48,275
There's chromatic aberration on the edges.

46
00:02:48,315 --> 00:02:49,536
Everything is fisheye distorted.

47
00:02:49,796 --> 00:02:51,918
There's two views of the same thing.

48
00:02:52,018 --> 00:02:53,039
Why would you even do that?

49
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:53,919
It doesn't make any sense.

50
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:55,160
So that's just really, really bad.

51
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,482
So the next thing people started doing was just doing the raw output of the head mount display.

52
00:02:59,502 --> 00:03:03,004
And we're like, hey, we'll take that and we'll move it around and people can see what the person's looking at and all this.

53
00:03:03,424 --> 00:03:08,407
But the problem with that is your head is like literally the worst camera in the world.

54
00:03:08,967 --> 00:03:12,549
It's super jittery, you're not focusing on anything for any length of time,

55
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:14,110
and your eyes are kind of darting around.

56
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:19,213
And your brain and eyes kind of cancel out, like all these little micro adjustments that your head is doing.

57
00:03:19,653 --> 00:03:22,614
And when you look at the 2D footage, it's like this shaky mess.

58
00:03:23,215 --> 00:03:25,776
And when you just see this, you can't really concentrate on anything.

59
00:03:25,816 --> 00:03:26,917
It's really hard to look at.

60
00:03:27,698 --> 00:03:30,579
And personally, I get motion sick watching footage like this,

61
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,240
especially when it's at 60 frames a second.

62
00:03:32,281 --> 00:03:33,541
It's really, really gross to look at.

63
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:37,424
So the next thing people started doing was this picture-on-picture thing.

64
00:03:37,444 --> 00:03:38,644
It's like, well, this will solve it.

65
00:03:38,665 --> 00:03:41,426
We'll show the guy in his dirty room going like this

66
00:03:41,506 --> 00:03:42,727
and trying to interact with stuff.

67
00:03:42,747 --> 00:03:43,808
And you can see what he's doing.

68
00:03:44,168 --> 00:03:47,570
But the two images don't link up in any discernible way.

69
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,212
It's just two completely separate things that are going on.

70
00:03:51,052 --> 00:03:52,373
So we knew that was bad too.

71
00:03:53,194 --> 00:03:57,177
So at the time, Sony started promoting the Morpheus, which turned into PSVR, obviously,

72
00:03:57,197 --> 00:04:00,460
and we're like, okay, here's a company with bazillions of dollars, they'll know what to do, right?

73
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,983
And so their solution, which I kind of like in one way, and we'll talk about a little bit later

74
00:04:05,143 --> 00:04:06,865
in another little section here.

75
00:04:07,285 --> 00:04:11,206
They do these virtual head-mount displays, and what they do is they kind of put the person in,

76
00:04:11,806 --> 00:04:15,668
and, you know, they film them on a green screen or whatever, and they put tracking markers on their face,

77
00:04:15,988 --> 00:04:20,609
and then they remove those and pose, they 3D track the head, and they put this virtual thing on their face.

78
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:25,991
And it's great because you can see the person's eyes, and you can sense the emotion that's happening

79
00:04:26,031 --> 00:04:28,172
that's usually hidden behind the head-mount display.

80
00:04:28,912 --> 00:04:32,636
and that's really nice but the problem is all the shots are completely fake.

81
00:04:32,957 --> 00:04:36,380
They're just reaction shots cut into first-person footage

82
00:04:36,781 --> 00:04:38,723
and you can tell that they're fake because they're just going like

83
00:04:38,823 --> 00:04:40,324
Whoa! Yeah! Awesome!

84
00:04:40,565 --> 00:04:43,808
You know, and it's not like linking up to the game in any way at all.

85
00:04:43,928 --> 00:04:45,890
It's just like these things that are just spliced in.

86
00:04:46,591 --> 00:04:47,812
So that kind of sucks too.

87
00:04:48,613 --> 00:04:59,020
So when it came time to do the trailer for fantastic contraption, we were like, okay, we don't want to do any of this stuff. We want to do something new. And we wanted to try this mixed reality thing. So let's take a look at the trailer here. And you can see what we did.

88
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:07,146
Fantastic contraption is a game about building and using your creativity.

89
00:05:08,607 --> 00:05:12,390
The challenge of the game is simple. You have to get the pink ball to the pink goal.

90
00:05:16,053 --> 00:05:16,633
And to do that

91
00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:19,645
You have to build a fantastic contraption.

92
00:06:34,622 --> 00:06:35,002
All right.

93
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:39,046
So that's what we came up with.

94
00:06:39,306 --> 00:06:41,127
And I really think that works really, really well.

95
00:06:41,248 --> 00:06:43,750
So why would you want to shoot a mixed reality trailer?

96
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,993
Well, I just think it's the best way to convey what it's actually like to be

97
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,455
in virtual reality on a 2D screen.

98
00:06:49,835 --> 00:06:51,296
And I'm not the only person that thinks this.

99
00:06:51,376 --> 00:06:52,217
Even Valve agrees.

100
00:06:52,357 --> 00:06:55,560
When they launched the Vive, they did their own sort of mixed reality trailer

101
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,861
that mimicked ours in a lot of ways.

102
00:06:57,162 --> 00:06:59,083
They had a bunch of people kind of sitting on the couch

103
00:06:59,123 --> 00:07:00,645
to kind of show us like the social thing.

104
00:07:00,925 --> 00:07:01,966
They had a whole bunch of different.

105
00:07:02,106 --> 00:07:11,109
You can see the trailer for Tilt Brush.

106
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,030
The way they did theirs is a little different than ours.

107
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:18,112
It was more of a visual effects post-production workflow than what we did, but the end result

108
00:07:18,192 --> 00:07:19,212
is basically the same.

109
00:07:19,993 --> 00:07:23,354
Now that it's been a year since people have started doing this, people are doing it for

110
00:07:23,394 --> 00:07:24,014
crazy stuff.

111
00:07:24,474 --> 00:07:28,156
This is like a collaboration Marvel did for the movie Doctor Strange.

112
00:07:28,196 --> 00:07:32,518
They got all these like tilt brush artists to like come in and do all this like super crazy stuff inside a tilt brush.

113
00:07:32,838 --> 00:07:35,239
And they did a mixed reality trailer to kind of promote that.

114
00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:38,220
And now even HoloLens is getting in on this action.

115
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,681
So the five of you out there with HoloLens can try this out.

116
00:07:41,121 --> 00:07:45,083
And you know you get like this crazy DSLR rig with like an extra HoloLens on it.

117
00:07:45,123 --> 00:07:47,624
And you can do mixed reality now with a HoloLens.

118
00:07:48,304 --> 00:07:50,765
And people are doing this live too and Colin's going to kind of talk.

119
00:07:51,045 --> 00:07:54,246
But more about this, but this was a Tokyo game show a couple months back now.

120
00:07:54,706 --> 00:07:57,327
And you've got this woman, she's all dressed up, she's in character.

121
00:07:57,607 --> 00:08:01,248
You've got this crazy, like, camera on a jib, so you're getting these nice, like, smooth

122
00:08:01,308 --> 00:08:02,828
cinematic camera moves.

123
00:08:03,188 --> 00:08:06,609
And if you look at the results that are, like, on the top there, you can see it looks like

124
00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:07,709
she's part of the game world.

125
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:08,789
She is like an actor.

126
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:10,930
She is performing inside of this world.

127
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,071
And that's one of the really main things I want you to take away from this, is that when

128
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:18,372
you're doing a mixed reality video or trailer or livestream or whatever it is, you are performing

129
00:08:18,412 --> 00:08:18,912
that game.

130
00:08:21,092 --> 00:08:26,837
And to sort of like hit that home, not to pick on these guys, but this is like an earlier trailer from this game Blasters of the Universe.

131
00:08:27,217 --> 00:08:31,441
This is like when they were just in Alpha, and we can see like all the pieces are there.

132
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:37,486
Yes, this is mixed reality, but this game is like super fun to play, but it looks like he's like kind of bored, right?

133
00:08:37,506 --> 00:08:41,068
He's kind of just like shooting. He's not like moving around very much. He's doing his thing.

134
00:08:41,369 --> 00:08:46,433
The compositing is not super good. You're always looking at his butt, you know, because he's like in that way in the green screen.

135
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:50,597
So there's all these weird things that you need to kind of think about now when you're

136
00:08:50,617 --> 00:08:53,981
making a mixed reality video that just doesn't normally apply.

137
00:08:54,522 --> 00:08:56,324
And I had to throw this in there because it's great.

138
00:08:56,344 --> 00:08:59,347
Someone did this like, Tilt Brush Bob Ross, The Joy of Painting.

139
00:09:00,744 --> 00:09:03,645
It's it's like 5 minutes you just got to check it out. It's like super good.

140
00:09:05,366 --> 00:09:28,413
So getting back to fantastic contraption. So what we did we use 3 different techniques to kind of convey what it's like to be inside of VR. We composited the player into the virtual environment. That's all the stuff we should on green screen. Then we brought some of the virtual objects from the game into the real world and the 3rd one here. I'm going to talk about for a little bit is we shot an in game avatar with a camera with a physical camera move that was created in the real world.

141
00:09:28,954 --> 00:09:31,475
And this could be literally its own talk on its own,

142
00:09:31,495 --> 00:09:32,696
and maybe we'll do it next year or whatever.

143
00:09:33,096 --> 00:09:35,038
But it's like, this kind of technology

144
00:09:35,058 --> 00:09:37,199
of virtual cinematography and virtual filmmaking

145
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:39,901
has been used on high-end movies for years and years.

146
00:09:39,921 --> 00:09:41,422
Like, they shot a lot of Avatar this way

147
00:09:41,502 --> 00:09:42,223
with a rig like that,

148
00:09:42,523 --> 00:09:44,344
but it cost like hundreds of thousands of dollars.

149
00:09:44,404 --> 00:09:45,425
And now you can literally do it

150
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,267
with a $150 Vive controller and a $5 Steadicam.

151
00:09:48,767 --> 00:09:51,669
So for the updated Fantastic Contraption trailer,

152
00:09:51,689 --> 00:09:52,729
this is actually what we did.

153
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,551
In my basement, I'm just shooting my friend Vince who's playing the game,

154
00:09:55,571 --> 00:09:58,652
but we're shooting an avatar rather than a live-action person.

155
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:00,652
And this has a number of advantages.

156
00:10:00,712 --> 00:10:04,894
It's like way cheaper to do this because you don't have to do the green screen studio and the setup and yadda yadda yadda.

157
00:10:05,374 --> 00:10:06,574
And it works incredibly well.

158
00:10:06,614 --> 00:10:10,976
You still get the sense that there's a player actually playing the game inside of this environment,

159
00:10:11,016 --> 00:10:14,537
but you don't have all the overhead involved of actually worrying about a live-action person.

160
00:10:14,957 --> 00:10:17,698
and like an actor and all the things that kind of come along with that.

161
00:10:18,198 --> 00:10:20,618
So we also did this for the Space Pirate Trainer trailer.

162
00:10:20,698 --> 00:10:24,039
And this kind of took it up like another level where the developer for this game

163
00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:29,640
had this fully rigged like inverse-kinematic crazy avatar that was being driven by the head and hand positions.

164
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,100
And we kind of shot him mostly from the waist up just to avoid the problems with the feet.

165
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,621
But this works super well.

166
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:39,001
Like there's no way we could have built a costume that looked this good and filmed them in mixed reality.

167
00:10:39,342 --> 00:10:42,942
So doing it as an in-game avatar was like really advantageous in this situation.

168
00:10:43,382 --> 00:10:45,523
And literally to do this, all you need is this.

169
00:10:45,723 --> 00:10:47,683
It's me in my basement with my friend Vince,

170
00:10:47,743 --> 00:10:49,364
playing like this, and I've got my phone

171
00:10:49,404 --> 00:10:50,664
as a little remote viewfinder,

172
00:10:51,144 --> 00:10:52,945
and you have Vive Control on a Steadicam.

173
00:10:53,265 --> 00:10:54,645
It's a pretty interesting solution.

174
00:10:54,765 --> 00:10:56,566
So I don't wanna talk about this really in depth

175
00:10:56,586 --> 00:10:57,986
because it's not exactly mixed reality,

176
00:10:58,026 --> 00:11:00,687
but it's something to keep in mind that your game,

177
00:11:00,887 --> 00:11:02,528
depending on what it is, or game or product

178
00:11:02,548 --> 00:11:03,948
or whatever it is, might be more suited

179
00:11:03,968 --> 00:11:05,308
towards that than mixed reality.

180
00:11:06,128 --> 00:11:09,133
There's also this, which is kind of a weird problem with Mixed Reality.

181
00:11:09,413 --> 00:11:12,658
How do you fix that there's a giant box on the person's face, right?

182
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:15,042
And honestly, aside from what Sony was doing,

183
00:11:15,162 --> 00:11:17,586
I didn't really think that there would be a solution to this.

184
00:11:17,947 --> 00:11:19,730
But just like Google fixed it.

185
00:11:21,032 --> 00:11:26,796
They came up with this amazing solution where they get this rough 3D geometry of a person's face

186
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:29,258
and capture their eye movement all across the screen.

187
00:11:29,558 --> 00:11:34,262
Then they add pupil tracking inside of the Vive, put a QR code on the front of the Vive,

188
00:11:34,603 --> 00:11:38,986
and then in post they're able to map that new generated 3D face

189
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,808
and composite it on top of the head mount display.

190
00:11:42,229 --> 00:11:47,614
And it's kind of janky and a little bit creepy, but it's surprisingly okay.

191
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:51,978
And it solves that communications problem, it's like you want to connect with the person's eyes.

192
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:57,084
So it's this really amazing little thing here that hopefully we'll see where this goes in the future.

193
00:11:58,059 --> 00:12:01,420
So to back all the way up to the beginning here,

194
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,081
so we'll take you through this entire process.

195
00:12:03,802 --> 00:12:06,343
This all started when Colin and Sarah Northaway

196
00:12:06,363 --> 00:12:08,464
were both contacted by Unity,

197
00:12:08,484 --> 00:12:10,005
and I guess they sent out this film crew

198
00:12:10,045 --> 00:12:12,726
called Breakwater Studios to do this little developer diary

199
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:14,027
on Fantastic Attraction,

200
00:12:14,047 --> 00:12:15,208
because it was being built in Unity.

201
00:12:16,008 --> 00:12:18,189
And Colin came up with a brilliant idea of just like,

202
00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:21,450
hey, let's just strap a third Vive controller on top of a DSLR.

203
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,730
We'll make that third Vive controller a virtual camera.

204
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,651
We'll align the positions in the virtual space.

205
00:12:27,211 --> 00:12:29,492
And we'll overlay the footage on top, and we'll see what it looks like.

206
00:12:29,652 --> 00:12:30,912
And it looked amazing.

207
00:12:30,993 --> 00:12:32,653
I remember the day that this came out.

208
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:35,074
And I saw the video, and I'm tweeting at Colin.

209
00:12:35,094 --> 00:12:36,514
I'm like, holy crap, dude.

210
00:12:36,554 --> 00:12:38,095
This is amazing.

211
00:12:38,135 --> 00:12:39,155
We've got to figure this out.

212
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:39,835
This is super cool.

213
00:12:40,335 --> 00:12:45,179
And so then you know a couple weeks went by January came around. He's like hey, do you want to do this and then we started figuring out?

214
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:59,268
OK, how are we going to do this for real and Colin kind of looked at the live streaming approach of doing it live and I kind of approached it more from a post production kind of standpoint of like doing trailers and doing it all in After Effects. So that's what I'm going to talk about and then call and we'll talk about the other stuff.

215
00:12:59,888 --> 00:13:02,729
So basically the trick to that is, the troll trick to this is this.

216
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:05,731
You know, you take a third Vive controller, now you can get like the tracking puck,

217
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:08,612
which is way better than just like elastic bands and gapping tape here.

218
00:13:09,332 --> 00:13:12,313
But you align a virtual camera to your physical camera's location,

219
00:13:12,813 --> 00:13:16,734
and Colin gave me this little UI where you can offset the virtual camera in XYZ position,

220
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:19,155
XYZ rotation, you change the field of view of the lens.

221
00:13:19,595 --> 00:13:22,096
You know, I'm just sort of oversimplifying it, but that's basically it.

222
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,457
And then once everything is kind of lined up, you get magic.

223
00:13:24,897 --> 00:13:27,158
And so this is the first test I sort of did in my basement.

224
00:13:27,178 --> 00:13:28,398
It was casefully thrown together.

225
00:13:28,758 --> 00:13:30,599
I'm just like, yeah, the pieces are kind of there.

226
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,139
It's working.

227
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:32,919
And I got super excited really fast.

228
00:13:32,939 --> 00:13:34,300
And I'm like, I got to move the camera.

229
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,300
So I called my friend Vince over.

230
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,300
He's like, Vince, you got to come over

231
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,101
so I can move the camera and have the display.

232
00:13:38,481 --> 00:13:39,861
And so I'm like going through the process

233
00:13:39,901 --> 00:13:41,562
of figuring out what do we need to fix?

234
00:13:41,662 --> 00:13:42,862
And what do we need to do

235
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,783
to make this actually look really professional?

236
00:13:45,704 --> 00:13:48,786
And so I very quickly realized I needed a better camera.

237
00:13:48,866 --> 00:13:52,909
I needed a camera that was stabilized so you're not getting this jittery motion all over the place.

238
00:13:53,469 --> 00:13:57,452
And the main thing that I started to realize is that you needed to choreograph this.

239
00:13:57,492 --> 00:14:00,794
You need to choreograph the movement between the player and the cameraman.

240
00:14:01,255 --> 00:14:03,356
And you need to know exactly what people are doing.

241
00:14:03,396 --> 00:14:04,417
And you need to practice.

242
00:14:04,857 --> 00:14:08,141
because when you're doing this stuff live, it's literally like you're acting it out.

243
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,183
It's not like you're just playing the gameplay. You can do it 50 times.

244
00:14:10,303 --> 00:14:12,306
It's like when you're doing it 50 times with an actor,

245
00:14:12,346 --> 00:14:14,348
the time this is taking is exponentially longer.

246
00:14:14,948 --> 00:14:18,252
So we need to make sure we had a shot list of all the things we needed to get

247
00:14:18,272 --> 00:14:20,735
and like practice this all and just go through it over and over again.

248
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,237
So in the end what we...

249
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:26,100
We decided to do a shoot with a Sony a7S II on a Movi Steadicam.

250
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,681
This is just the gear that we had laying around.

251
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,883
There's other cameras, there's other solutions that you can use.

252
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:30,984
This is just what we used.

253
00:14:31,464 --> 00:14:35,248
And this is the final test that we shot in the basement where I was confident that this

254
00:14:35,288 --> 00:14:35,968
was going to work.

255
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:37,870
So this is me playing the game.

256
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,592
My friend Ray is working the camera with the stabilizer.

257
00:14:40,692 --> 00:14:42,073
And this feels really meaty.

258
00:14:42,153 --> 00:14:45,696
It feels like we got a nice wide field of view so we can capture the entire contraption.

259
00:14:46,237 --> 00:14:47,677
The camera movement feels stable.

260
00:14:47,737 --> 00:14:50,418
He's kind of working with me to figure out where we're going to shoot this.

261
00:14:50,738 --> 00:14:51,998
And it felt really, really good.

262
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:55,139
So once we did this, I was like, OK, we can shoot this on the green screen

263
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:56,100
and this is going to work great.

264
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,541
So then it actually came time to do it in production.

265
00:15:00,301 --> 00:15:03,442
And I don't know if anybody here has been on a film set or anything,

266
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:06,643
but there's dozens of people involved in making these things happen.

267
00:15:07,103 --> 00:15:08,444
There's a lot of people waiting around.

268
00:15:08,544 --> 00:15:09,725
And so when you're on the green screen,

269
00:15:09,805 --> 00:15:11,026
it's not the time to experiment.

270
00:15:11,126 --> 00:15:13,127
It's the time to execute what you plan to do.

271
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,469
So we had this whole shot list.

272
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:18,911
And I just want to show you here, this is what a whole rough take looks like.

273
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,393
So this is the very first thing we shot on the green screen.

274
00:15:21,493 --> 00:15:22,714
Camera is rolling.

275
00:15:23,034 --> 00:15:23,714
Camera's rolling.

276
00:15:24,075 --> 00:15:25,155
Gameplay is rolling.

277
00:15:26,036 --> 00:15:26,737
Slate one.

278
00:15:27,717 --> 00:15:27,997
Good.

279
00:15:28,118 --> 00:15:29,118
Controller calibration.

280
00:15:30,019 --> 00:15:33,561
You can't see the thing, right?

281
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:33,782
OK.

282
00:15:33,922 --> 00:15:35,243
Controller is off.

283
00:15:35,663 --> 00:15:36,223
And action.

284
00:15:37,127 --> 00:15:40,729
So we had to go through that entire process you just saw there for every single take.

285
00:15:40,849 --> 00:15:43,251
And we did 90 takes of various things.

286
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:46,413
And this was just kind of the first one just to kind of get in the flow of things.

287
00:15:46,453 --> 00:15:49,656
But you can kind of see the compositing is really rough in this because it's just a temp comp.

288
00:15:49,876 --> 00:15:52,738
But you can see the light stands get in the back, his hands are kind of going over that.

289
00:15:52,778 --> 00:15:55,240
So that needs to be rotoscoped out in post-production.

290
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,402
And you know, we're just, you go through it and you just sort of go through the shots

291
00:15:58,462 --> 00:16:01,384
and you put together what works in the end to make an interesting video.

292
00:16:02,165 --> 00:16:06,467
So, just to give a really high-level overview of what this actually looks like,

293
00:16:06,527 --> 00:16:07,927
Colin's going to go into this in more depth.

294
00:16:08,288 --> 00:16:12,089
But what we did in order to capture this is we split the computer screen up into quads,

295
00:16:12,189 --> 00:16:14,030
and so we have four pieces of footage to work with.

296
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:17,452
We have a foreground view in the upper right, background the upper left,

297
00:16:17,572 --> 00:16:21,173
and then we basically sandwiched the green screen footage in between those two views.

298
00:16:21,453 --> 00:16:25,235
And we also had a smooth head-mount display view in the lower right-hand corner

299
00:16:25,295 --> 00:16:27,436
just in case we needed to cut to first-person footage

300
00:16:27,476 --> 00:16:29,677
because, let's just say, the whole thing didn't work.

301
00:16:30,097 --> 00:16:33,160
You know, or whatever. Just as a backup, we had that in case we needed it.

302
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,162
And we did use it in one or two little shots here and there.

303
00:16:35,702 --> 00:16:37,584
So just so you can see this all kind of slapped together,

304
00:16:37,624 --> 00:16:40,466
this is just like a, you know, shows a compositing pass of all this stuff.

305
00:16:40,486 --> 00:16:42,508
So here's the green screen footage we shot with the camera.

306
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:46,652
And then the, this is the foreground layer, which we then kind of just like keyed out to blue.

307
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,693
So this is everything in front of the head mount display.

308
00:16:49,054 --> 00:16:51,376
Then we bring in everything behind the head mount display.

309
00:16:51,816 --> 00:16:53,697
And Colin's kind of sandwiched in between there.

310
00:16:53,837 --> 00:16:55,618
And then we do sort of like a compositing pass.

311
00:16:55,678 --> 00:16:57,919
And we do color correction, light wrap, motion blur,

312
00:16:57,939 --> 00:17:00,040
and things like that to kind of smooth everything together.

313
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,281
And that's one of the advantages of doing this in post,

314
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,682
is you're able to do things like that

315
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:07,203
to make it actually look a lot better than you would

316
00:17:07,223 --> 00:17:08,564
if it was being composited live.

317
00:17:09,284 --> 00:17:11,766
So that's kind of like the rough scope of it.

318
00:17:11,866 --> 00:17:14,848
And then it's just a matter of doing this for, you know, days and after effects

319
00:17:14,948 --> 00:17:16,189
and like putting it all together.

320
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:19,911
And the actual process of like making an interesting trailer is its own talk

321
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:20,472
on its own.

322
00:17:20,912 --> 00:17:23,714
But, you know, we just wanted to make sure we had a variety of shots

323
00:17:23,774 --> 00:17:26,436
that showed off the game in as many possible ways as we could.

324
00:17:26,896 --> 00:17:29,518
And then just put that all together in a really, really nice package.

325
00:17:30,118 --> 00:17:32,300
So, yeah, that's basically how you do it in post.

326
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,022
And now Colin's going to kind of talk about the nuts and bolts of this

327
00:17:35,082 --> 00:17:36,163
and how you do it live.

328
00:17:37,594 --> 00:17:38,194
Sorry, all right.

329
00:17:39,075 --> 00:17:41,436
So like Kurt says, as he introduced me,

330
00:17:41,496 --> 00:17:42,337
I'm Colin Northway.

331
00:17:43,697 --> 00:17:45,258
My wife and I are Northway Games.

332
00:17:45,378 --> 00:17:47,179
And along with Radial Games and Ashelm Peradio,

333
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:48,340
we made Fantastic Entraption.

334
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,463
This is actually the first ever live stream mixed reality

335
00:17:53,503 --> 00:17:55,804
video ever made, which I think is pretty cool.

336
00:17:56,144 --> 00:17:58,305
So I'm going to talk more about how to integrate this stuff

337
00:17:58,325 --> 00:17:58,845
into your game.

338
00:17:58,865 --> 00:18:00,026
I'm also going to talk a little more

339
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:01,527
from a streamer's perspective, because we

340
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:02,527
did a fair amount of streaming.

341
00:18:02,587 --> 00:18:05,269
And Kurt covered the post, the trailer post up pretty well.

342
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:09,211
Alright, so mixed reality is a pretty simple idea, right?

343
00:18:09,231 --> 00:18:10,472
You really have three planes.

344
00:18:10,492 --> 00:18:14,414
You've got the plane behind the player, you've got the player separated from their reality

345
00:18:14,454 --> 00:18:16,675
via green screen, and you've got the plane in front of the player.

346
00:18:17,853 --> 00:18:19,974
So you just need your game to output those three planes,

347
00:18:20,174 --> 00:18:21,674
and then you need to stick them together.

348
00:18:22,374 --> 00:18:24,175
A quick note about the rear plane.

349
00:18:25,035 --> 00:18:27,516
You notice in Kurt's footage, the rear plane actually

350
00:18:27,596 --> 00:18:29,776
held everything that was behind the player,

351
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:31,597
but now we just, in the rear plane,

352
00:18:31,637 --> 00:18:33,517
put the entire game in there.

353
00:18:33,937 --> 00:18:35,697
There's some smaller reasons to do that,

354
00:18:35,778 --> 00:18:38,438
like usually the ground is in the rear plane,

355
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,838
so if you start popping objects out of that,

356
00:18:39,858 --> 00:18:41,539
their shadows disappear, which obviously

357
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:42,219
doesn't look very good.

358
00:18:43,575 --> 00:18:47,058
So there's a couple different ways to do those splitting up of screens.

359
00:18:47,858 --> 00:18:49,920
There's kind of two broad approaches.

360
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,523
One of those is to do the compositing outside of the game, and one is to do the compositing

361
00:18:53,723 --> 00:18:54,404
inside of the game.

362
00:18:55,324 --> 00:18:58,647
So we're going to talk about compositing outside of the game first, and there's kind of two

363
00:18:58,707 --> 00:19:00,028
broad ways to approach that.

364
00:19:00,548 --> 00:19:05,512
There's compositing, there's moving objects between layers manually, and then there's

365
00:19:05,592 --> 00:19:06,893
using the camera clipping plane.

366
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:13,219
So I call this like object blipping because objects blip back and forth between the front

367
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:14,279
camera and the rear camera.

368
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,481
So this is really flexible.

369
00:19:17,002 --> 00:19:17,862
It's good for trailers.

370
00:19:17,922 --> 00:19:18,663
It looks good.

371
00:19:20,485 --> 00:19:22,586
But this takes some integration to get into your game.

372
00:19:23,147 --> 00:19:28,411
So I'm going to talk from a Unity point of view, but all of this applies to Custom Engine

373
00:19:28,471 --> 00:19:29,552
or also if you're using Unreal.

374
00:19:29,932 --> 00:19:33,435
Unreal is a little harder to do mixed reality because it's harder to have multiple cameras.

375
00:19:34,578 --> 00:19:40,923
But in Unity, all you need to do here is have some objects on a foreground camera layer

376
00:19:41,484 --> 00:19:43,526
and your other objects on a background camera layer.

377
00:19:44,206 --> 00:19:47,729
So the only reason that that might be tricky is because the Unity layer system is really

378
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:50,572
overloaded and they use those same layers for collision detection.

379
00:19:51,132 --> 00:19:56,476
So if you've already made a game and you've got thousands of objects and tons of prefabs already,

380
00:19:56,916 --> 00:20:01,720
and you have renderers and collision on the same game objects,

381
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:06,323
then it's going to be really hard to go through and separate those two things so you can change which layer things are on.

382
00:20:06,604 --> 00:20:10,406
Because if you have an existing game and you just start changing willy-nilly what layer things are on,

383
00:20:10,446 --> 00:20:12,148
it's going to totally screw up your collision system.

384
00:20:12,688 --> 00:20:18,871
So this can take some integration work to get in and might not be easy to do for everybody,

385
00:20:18,991 --> 00:20:25,793
but I think it's a really good way to do things if you can fit it into your game.

386
00:20:26,554 --> 00:20:29,695
A technique that is super easy to get into your game uses the clipping plane.

387
00:20:29,775 --> 00:20:33,057
So this is like conceptually by far the easiest way to do mixed reality.

388
00:20:33,637 --> 00:20:35,097
It's really simple to get into your game.

389
00:20:36,438 --> 00:20:40,582
You literally have background camera, it's fine, normal camera just like the previous one.

390
00:20:41,062 --> 00:20:48,829
The foreground camera, you just set the far clipping plane equal to the distance from the camera to the player, right?

391
00:20:48,969 --> 00:20:50,810
And then it just doesn't render anything behind.

392
00:20:51,671 --> 00:20:54,774
A couple of problems with this technique, it doesn't look quite as good as the object

393
00:20:54,814 --> 00:20:56,235
splitting between layers technique.

394
00:20:57,036 --> 00:21:00,539
You get that seam between the objects, which is hard to get rid of.

395
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,863
Obviously in the previous technique there is some visual difference between objects

396
00:21:05,903 --> 00:21:07,545
moving between layers, but it's much subtler.

397
00:21:08,646 --> 00:21:13,970
And also there's the toes problem, because the game, you can see Sarah's toe disappears.

398
00:21:15,221 --> 00:21:17,906
whenever it's in front of her headset,

399
00:21:17,926 --> 00:21:20,791
because the game doesn't know that the ground is a special object.

400
00:21:20,891 --> 00:21:22,374
If you're blipping objects between layers,

401
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,097
you can put in some custom logic,

402
00:21:24,398 --> 00:21:26,321
make sure the ground is always on the background layer.

403
00:21:28,523 --> 00:21:34,126
So, like I say, the compositing for this step is all done outside of your game.

404
00:21:34,506 --> 00:21:38,408
And so the streamer, if you're, so there's two options to do that.

405
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:41,990
If you're a streamer, then you'll have to download a program to do that.

406
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:45,192
Lots of streamers use this software called open broadcasting software.

407
00:21:45,212 --> 00:21:46,113
They're really familiar with it.

408
00:21:46,133 --> 00:21:47,053
It does everything you need.

409
00:21:47,733 --> 00:21:49,915
If you're doing a trailer, then you just like make Kurt do it.

410
00:21:51,656 --> 00:22:10,714
So set up is it's not super easy and there's no way to take it there's no way to do it for the user of us doesn't have the idea of like you can't make like configurations and and send send them to people or anything so you can read a good tutorial but it's going to add a lot of friction to the player that's doing it they have to take your game footage and thence.

411
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:26,789
Like literally type in numbers to split up which which quarter is for which screen and then they have to blow it all up and they do the green screen key in OBS and then smack it all together and so it's a fair amount of work for the player and there's also a really

412
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:35,657
big problem with this technique of doing the compositing outside of the game is getting to 1080 P footage right so.

413
00:22:36,895 --> 00:22:42,301
You need to get 2 screens out of your game, and the simplest way to do that is just to render them next to each other.

414
00:22:42,441 --> 00:22:46,285
So literally, that would be the output for Fantastic Contraption.

415
00:22:46,305 --> 00:22:49,749
We split the screen into quads, and then I have the foreground and the background separately.

416
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:53,553
But obviously, if you have a 1080 monitor, then those are half 1080 resolution.

417
00:22:53,653 --> 00:22:56,956
And when you blow it up, it looks a lot worse than it would if it was full 1080.

418
00:22:57,917 --> 00:23:03,042
So a couple solutions for that is the most obvious one is you can go out and buy a 4K screen,

419
00:23:03,202 --> 00:23:08,486
and then all of your quads are 1080, but then you're adding, for the potential streamer out there,

420
00:23:08,506 --> 00:23:11,548
you're adding like a big monetary investment for them to be able to do this.

421
00:23:12,409 --> 00:23:15,191
Another possibility is you can do like output to multiple screens,

422
00:23:15,332 --> 00:23:18,474
but then the setup is going to be even more confusing for the streamer.

423
00:23:20,247 --> 00:23:24,109
So a technique to avoid all of these downsides is to do the

424
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:25,690
compositing inside the game.

425
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:28,091
So doing the compositing inside the game has a couple

426
00:23:28,111 --> 00:23:28,831
good advantages.

427
00:23:29,751 --> 00:23:31,652
Big one is it looks really good.

428
00:23:31,932 --> 00:23:35,514
So it doesn't have, there's no seams or objects aren't moving

429
00:23:35,554 --> 00:23:37,595
around, they're always rendered in place with the

430
00:23:37,615 --> 00:23:39,535
proper background where they're supposed

431
00:23:39,575 --> 00:23:40,176
to be in the game.

432
00:23:41,237 --> 00:23:45,224
And then also a big advantage of this is for streamers, it's very low friction.

433
00:23:45,264 --> 00:23:48,049
They just like start your game up, they plug in their camera,

434
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,634
and then maybe they do some configuring of green screens,

435
00:23:50,915 --> 00:23:52,538
they set up their camera position, and they're good.

436
00:23:53,761 --> 00:23:55,803
So you'd be like, well, OK, perfect.

437
00:23:55,823 --> 00:23:56,723
We'll just all use this.

438
00:23:56,743 --> 00:23:58,425
We don't have to think about the external compositing.

439
00:23:58,805 --> 00:24:00,607
Except for two problems with that, of course.

440
00:24:01,427 --> 00:24:03,169
One, this only works with cameras

441
00:24:03,229 --> 00:24:05,250
that Unity can recognize.

442
00:24:06,671 --> 00:24:08,713
And that is only webcams.

443
00:24:08,973 --> 00:24:13,617
So Unity can't read capture cards, HDMI capture cards.

444
00:24:14,017 --> 00:24:16,720
And those are how you're going to get a really good camera

445
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,260
into your system.

446
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:25,705
So a lot of streamers do use webcams, but when they're using a webcam, they're really like, sitting about a meter away from it, like, you know, next to their monitor.

447
00:24:26,326 --> 00:24:35,031
And that's what webcams are designed to do, so they're good at it. But when you're doing mixed reality, now you're more like three or four meters away from the webcam, and they're really bad at resolving images that far away.

448
00:24:35,151 --> 00:24:45,277
So, like, one of the many reasons that my footage looks so much worse than Kurt's footage is because this is using a good webcam, but it's just a webcam instead of a really good camera.

449
00:24:46,158 --> 00:24:52,381
Definitely the number one thing streamers can do to improve the look of their stream is just dump money into a camera.

450
00:24:52,841 --> 00:24:55,563
So if you do the in-game system, they can't do that.

451
00:24:56,183 --> 00:24:59,525
There's kind of some tools on the market that are starting to pop up to let you

452
00:25:01,146 --> 00:25:05,308
put an HDMI camera into a USB and be readable by Unity.

453
00:25:05,808 --> 00:25:10,471
So that would be a good solution. A better solution would be is if anybody in this room works for Unity,

454
00:25:10,691 --> 00:25:14,313
when they get home, they can make Unity read catcher cards, which would be awesome.

455
00:25:16,404 --> 00:25:21,847
A potential problem with this is it has the same toes problem as the clipping plane technique,

456
00:25:22,067 --> 00:25:26,329
but since you are doing logic in your game, oh yeah, well I guess I'll talk a little bit

457
00:25:26,349 --> 00:25:27,309
about how we actually do it.

458
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:29,450
So this is one way to do it.

459
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:32,211
This is the kind of simplest, conceptually really simple.

460
00:25:32,251 --> 00:25:36,313
We literally just take a billboard, we put it in the game.

461
00:25:36,914 --> 00:25:49,309
To where the player is so from the player the word is like surrounding me and then we just draw the webcam on top of that. We the still here, but where you see Sarah with their arms out that would be webcam the moving webcam image.

462
00:25:50,999 --> 00:25:53,541
And then we move that to wherever the player is,

463
00:25:53,561 --> 00:25:54,401
we move the billboard.

464
00:25:54,521 --> 00:25:55,822
And then you just resize it to take up

465
00:25:55,842 --> 00:25:57,483
the entire of the camera frustum.

466
00:25:58,303 --> 00:26:00,565
And so this has the same toes problem

467
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:02,706
that the clipping plane has, but you can solve it

468
00:26:02,746 --> 00:26:05,868
by where your camera frustum overlaps with the ground.

469
00:26:05,928 --> 00:26:07,449
You can just draw yourself a quad there,

470
00:26:07,489 --> 00:26:08,830
and then project the camera on that as well.

471
00:26:10,851 --> 00:26:11,571
Which looks really good.

472
00:26:12,012 --> 00:26:12,792
I really like how this looks.

473
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:22,015
So I'm going to talk a little bit about if you don't want to write all these tools into

474
00:26:22,035 --> 00:26:24,878
the game yourself, there are some tools that can help you do it.

475
00:26:25,779 --> 00:26:30,264
And those, they're kind of popping up now.

476
00:26:30,284 --> 00:26:33,687
They're kind of just starting to get, people are kind of just starting to start release

477
00:26:33,728 --> 00:26:34,749
tools that are usable.

478
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:39,414
This is probably built into your game already if you are working in Unity.

479
00:26:39,995 --> 00:26:46,423
This, um, Kurt showed a little bit of footage of the Steam trailer for the Vive that was on Mixed Reality.

480
00:26:46,904 --> 00:26:51,691
And so Valve actually wrote this tool into SteamVR specifically to make that trailer.

481
00:26:52,171 --> 00:26:56,498
So, it's still in SteamVR from like a year ago when they wrote it.

482
00:26:57,838 --> 00:27:01,921
So you can use that. That's what streamers are using kind of today to do stuff.

483
00:27:01,961 --> 00:27:05,343
But it's really limiting. It was written for one very specific usage.

484
00:27:05,723 --> 00:27:10,666
It was written just to do their trailer and it did exactly what they needed it to do and 0% more.

485
00:27:11,727 --> 00:27:17,670
It's actually a particularly bad tool for streaming because when you do streaming output from your game...

486
00:27:18,788 --> 00:27:20,689
You can capture the alpha channel from your window,

487
00:27:21,149 --> 00:27:24,331
but the Valve tool nukes that alpha information,

488
00:27:24,391 --> 00:27:25,512
so OBS can't read it.

489
00:27:26,172 --> 00:27:28,534
Valve solves that problem by outputting

490
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:31,075
grayscale alpha information in one of the corners,

491
00:27:31,535 --> 00:27:34,037
but there is no streaming tool that can make use of that.

492
00:27:34,977 --> 00:27:38,279
So the best you get, and they use the clipping plane technique

493
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,160
that we talked about earlier.

494
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,542
Of course, it's easy to make a tool that uses the clipping plane technique

495
00:27:43,582 --> 00:27:44,983
that we talked about, so it makes sense.

496
00:27:46,084 --> 00:27:47,725
The big problem here is the alpha stuff.

497
00:27:47,825 --> 00:27:53,410
You can see there, when the clipping plane overcomes objects that are partially transparent,

498
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,211
it looks really terrible.

499
00:27:54,751 --> 00:27:59,115
You can also see there's a line going up that has a black edge around it because they just,

500
00:27:59,235 --> 00:28:00,857
you literally have to key out black.

501
00:28:01,577 --> 00:28:03,239
So it's a really, it's not a very good tool.

502
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:04,700
It was never really designed to do this.

503
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,083
So this is like where we're looking to improve upon from now.

504
00:28:09,524 --> 00:28:14,708
There's a company in Vancouver that is working on MixCast VR.

505
00:28:15,248 --> 00:28:16,149
I really like these guys.

506
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,212
We did a lot of streaming out of their studio,

507
00:28:20,312 --> 00:28:22,194
actually, before they were working on this tool.

508
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,916
So their priorities and our priorities

509
00:28:24,996 --> 00:28:25,956
overlap really closely.

510
00:28:27,197 --> 00:28:28,518
They're out now.

511
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:29,899
They just released last week.

512
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,162
And they have actually three ways

513
00:28:33,202 --> 00:28:34,803
of doing compositing in MixCast.

514
00:28:35,404 --> 00:28:37,385
So this is the in-game technique,

515
00:28:37,485 --> 00:28:38,406
like we talked about earlier.

516
00:28:39,792 --> 00:28:46,556
And then there's also, they have, okay, I'm going to talk a little bit about camera delay.

517
00:28:47,056 --> 00:28:51,878
So another downside of the in-game technique is if you watch Sarah, the game is a little

518
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:52,439
bit ahead of her.

519
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:55,260
You'll see the wheel bounces a little faster than she does.

520
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:01,623
So whenever you have, however you get a camera from the real world into the game, that real

521
00:29:01,663 --> 00:29:05,565
world image is always delayed a little bit and the game is always, you know, is much

522
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:06,406
closer to real time.

523
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:11,769
So you always get this weird look of the game knowing what the future is,

524
00:29:12,069 --> 00:29:15,211
and the person and the player being behind in time.

525
00:29:16,191 --> 00:29:19,733
So if you're compositing externally with OBS,

526
00:29:20,174 --> 00:29:21,214
you've got a good solution for that.

527
00:29:22,075 --> 00:29:25,437
Literally take your game, every game frame, just buffer it and add a delay.

528
00:29:25,677 --> 00:29:28,139
So you can solve this delay problem perfectly.

529
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:33,483
But if you do the in-game technique, then it's not obvious how you solve the delay because

530
00:29:33,643 --> 00:29:39,228
the player is inside the game already, so you can't delay it because they're also in

531
00:29:39,268 --> 00:29:39,308
it.

532
00:29:40,609 --> 00:29:45,552
So, um, MixCast is an interesting solution to this.

533
00:29:45,772 --> 00:29:48,694
Uh, they can't solve it entirely, so they give you two options.

534
00:29:49,274 --> 00:29:53,236
Uh, they give you this in-game option if you have a low lag camera,

535
00:29:53,476 --> 00:29:56,698
or if you are playing a game that doesn't have, like, really fast hand motions,

536
00:29:57,159 --> 00:29:58,800
then you can cheat it and get away with it.

537
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,962
Or they also have an in-game clipping plane technique.

538
00:30:03,242 --> 00:30:03,422
So...

539
00:30:04,143 --> 00:30:09,026
In-game, they render the background, they render the clipping ground foreground,

540
00:30:09,387 --> 00:30:12,189
they put your player in, in-game, with their own green screen tech,

541
00:30:12,649 --> 00:30:14,730
and then they delay the game.

542
00:30:15,071 --> 00:30:20,294
So you still have all the ease of setup, and you still have, but you get that delayed footage.

543
00:30:20,754 --> 00:30:25,718
They also have an output, they also have the split-screen quad output,

544
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:28,200
so if you want to do compositing outside of it, you can do that.

545
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,481
So I think this is a really good solution.

546
00:30:30,482 --> 00:30:33,645
As you can see, I implemented MixCast into Fantastic Entraption.

547
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:34,986
It literally took me under a minute.

548
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:38,869
I dragged in two prefabs and he'd go and like, this is the footage coming out of it,

549
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,431
which I think is pretty cool.

550
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:44,835
Something I kind of glossed over earlier is when...

551
00:30:46,797 --> 00:30:57,348
For any of this to work, you need a real-life camera and you need an in-game camera, and they have to be in the same place, in the same position in space, and also the same rotation in space.

552
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:04,596
So in that Valve tool that they made specifically for their trailer, the way you set that is, there's a configuration file.

553
00:31:05,077 --> 00:31:08,260
You've got like, you know, a camera here.

554
00:31:08,961 --> 00:31:10,683
And like a controller glued to it here.

555
00:31:11,223 --> 00:31:13,325
And then you start it up.

556
00:31:13,385 --> 00:31:15,147
You realize that, oh, the in-game controller

557
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:16,948
thinks it's facing straight up.

558
00:31:17,048 --> 00:31:19,811
And it's also off to the right because it's where it's taped.

559
00:31:20,392 --> 00:31:21,913
And so you go in the configuration file.

560
00:31:21,933 --> 00:31:24,135
And you take random guesses about where that might be.

561
00:31:24,155 --> 00:31:24,976
And then you start the game.

562
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:26,217
And you see that it's still off.

563
00:31:26,277 --> 00:31:27,158
And you close the game.

564
00:31:27,198 --> 00:31:27,899
And you make the changes.

565
00:31:27,939 --> 00:31:29,180
And then you start the game again.

566
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,101
And then you have to actually restart the game

567
00:31:31,142 --> 00:31:32,042
every time you make a change.

568
00:31:32,703 --> 00:31:38,851
Hugely painful so in contraption we have usually 2 people to do it. We've got one person.

569
00:31:38,871 --> 00:31:50,366
Do we think these radio somebody with controllers in the real world and in the game world right because you know your controllers in the real world and in the game world. So you have one person making these like T poses and kind of like.

570
00:31:50,787 --> 00:31:59,030
hinting to the person standing at the computer who is using like arrow keys and WASD to fly this real-life camera into the place and sync it up perfectly.

571
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:04,152
Mixcast has this really nice solution where they use the same general idea,

572
00:32:04,992 --> 00:32:06,953
but they put it all inside VR.

573
00:32:07,313 --> 00:32:14,215
So I put on the headset and then I grab the virtual camera and I put it over close to where the real camera is.

574
00:32:14,715 --> 00:32:19,136
I see the footage of me, and I can see the controllers in-game and in real life, and

575
00:32:19,156 --> 00:32:22,937
then they have these nice nudging buttons so I can get it to just where I want it, so

576
00:32:22,957 --> 00:32:23,858
I can get it looking perfect.

577
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:28,719
There's also, you have to set the camera field of view, which adds this weird complication

578
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:32,260
because you're never totally sure whether your camera is too far forward or too far

579
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,740
back or if the field of view is too wide or too shallow.

580
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,781
So their solution to that is...

581
00:32:38,142 --> 00:32:41,065
They actually just have a database of field of views of cameras.

582
00:32:41,285 --> 00:32:45,630
So when you plug your camera in, hit a button, it goes up to their database and you're like,

583
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:48,593
okay, well, field of view for that is 45, you don't have to worry about it.

584
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,516
Which actually is, surprises, simplifies things surprisingly enough.

585
00:32:54,996 --> 00:32:58,918
They also have a really nice built-in green screen system where you just like

586
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:03,240
flop to the green screen and then like hover over the green canvas and fade it all out.

587
00:33:04,261 --> 00:33:06,402
So I really like MixCast. I think it's really worth looking at.

588
00:33:07,342 --> 00:33:11,965
One more advantage is this is all done in an external tool launched from Steam rather than in your game.

589
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:14,626
So if players set it once, they never have to set it again.

590
00:33:14,706 --> 00:33:18,468
So for streamers, that's really low friction, which I think is what you're looking for for streamers.

591
00:33:19,549 --> 00:33:28,814
The last system we're going to look at is the kind of like crazy future tech left field job sim mixed reality, which is like the coolest.

592
00:33:30,155 --> 00:33:31,716
They use a depth camera.

593
00:33:33,183 --> 00:33:37,566
uh... and so in all of these systems the player is actually two-dimensional right

594
00:33:37,966 --> 00:33:38,487
so you have

595
00:33:39,087 --> 00:33:42,509
one position for where the player is and that's like where the headset is and

596
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:43,550
that's where they are in space

597
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:47,473
so if you try to reach over something your hand is not going to go over it

598
00:33:47,533 --> 00:33:50,435
like if i try to reach over the podium my hand would actually clip behind it

599
00:33:51,715 --> 00:33:52,816
but with the alchemy system

600
00:33:54,317 --> 00:33:55,898
I'll get back there you'll watch me grab the

601
00:33:56,479 --> 00:33:57,740
grab the donut off the tray

602
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,342
with the alchemy system they use the zed depth camera

603
00:34:03,415 --> 00:34:09,522
This guy, they use this Z-depth camera to actually get the depth of where your body

604
00:34:09,682 --> 00:34:12,205
is in real life.

605
00:34:12,406 --> 00:34:16,491
So your arm is in front of your body and they know roughly where that is.

606
00:34:16,511 --> 00:34:21,216
And so they can use that to composite you actually three-dimensionally into the game

607
00:34:21,256 --> 00:34:21,557
itself.

608
00:34:21,777 --> 00:34:21,997
And so.

609
00:34:23,527 --> 00:34:28,052
Um, it can't, right, so ideally that, you can even do that without a green screen because

610
00:34:28,093 --> 00:34:32,157
it's separating you perfectly from the world but depth cameras are not that good.

611
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:39,485
So you still need a green screen, this is like kind of a hybrid green screen, um, it's

612
00:34:39,505 --> 00:34:41,708
kind of a hybrid like green screen depth camera approach.

613
00:34:43,944 --> 00:34:49,907
They're also, since this is similar to the, right, this is in the same family as the in-game

614
00:34:50,147 --> 00:34:50,847
rendering techniques.

615
00:34:51,207 --> 00:34:55,168
And so since you're doing it in-game, you have, you can mess with the image in all these

616
00:34:55,188 --> 00:34:55,669
different ways.

617
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:58,410
And so they're like really taking advantage of that.

618
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:00,490
They do lighting effects.

619
00:35:02,611 --> 00:35:07,773
And if you watch when I teleport out, oh yeah, yeah, these are, I always like these.

620
00:35:08,727 --> 00:35:10,449
And if you watch when I teleport out, you'll see them like,

621
00:35:10,889 --> 00:35:13,731
push a blue, kind of some blue sparklies in front of me.

622
00:35:16,594 --> 00:35:19,136
And so you can like mess with the player and what it looks like,

623
00:35:20,657 --> 00:35:21,278
since it's in the game.

624
00:35:21,298 --> 00:35:22,899
They're also developing all of these,

625
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,721
they're developing tools to make all of this like lighting

626
00:35:25,781 --> 00:35:27,743
and player effect stuff work better and integrate better

627
00:35:27,763 --> 00:35:28,223
into your game.

628
00:35:30,734 --> 00:35:35,775
I remember there's that problem of thinking of where the cameras in real

629
00:35:35,795 --> 00:35:40,576
life and where it is in your game so how can he has this super interesting

630
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:46,898
technique to solving a problem in so they actually 3D print this like little

631
00:35:46,998 --> 00:35:52,119
mount that marries the said camera to a 3rd steam controller and then you always

632
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:55,740
if you know that transform is then you're good you don't have to like mess

633
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:59,821
with anything so that's great if you have a third controller

634
00:36:01,661 --> 00:36:08,743
All of these systems work with 3 controllers. Kurt was talking about handheld, because handheld footage, especially in trailer world, looks a lot better than, like, fixed, like, footage.

635
00:36:10,103 --> 00:36:17,544
So, all of the techniques I talked about before work super well with 3rd controller, or the Vive trackers that are coming out now.

636
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,725
It's, like, really obvious how to integrate all of that and set that up.

637
00:36:21,205 --> 00:36:25,046
It's really just like a moving mount point instead of a fixed one, and then when you...

638
00:36:25,926 --> 00:36:29,209
When you line up your in real life camera with your in game camera,

639
00:36:29,529 --> 00:36:32,031
that's just lining up the offset of the thing taped to it.

640
00:36:33,252 --> 00:36:36,174
So I think that's a really cool solution to the offset problem

641
00:36:36,935 --> 00:36:39,557
that I'd like to see more of.

642
00:36:39,577 --> 00:36:41,858
Hopefully that'll become like a standard mount in the future.

643
00:36:43,821 --> 00:36:47,804
Those are all the techniques and the tools that I think are worth mentioning right now.

644
00:36:48,264 --> 00:36:56,009
All of these have such clear upsides and downsides that I thought I'd just make some slides that are like simple pros and cons.

645
00:36:56,029 --> 00:37:01,012
So if you want to take a picture of slides right now, this is like the, this is the rundown.

646
00:37:01,792 --> 00:37:06,455
Like you'll know all the pros and cons simply if you catch these.

647
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,380
I don't want to talk about the webcam thing on that one.

648
00:37:22,021 --> 00:37:23,542
The webcam thing on the last one there.

649
00:37:23,562 --> 00:37:23,722
Yeah.

650
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:30,805
All right.

651
00:37:31,065 --> 00:37:34,566
And that's all i have to talk about, about mixed reality integration.

652
00:37:35,727 --> 00:37:36,247
Okay. Cool.

653
00:37:36,347 --> 00:37:40,068
So just to kind of sum everything up, we got time for a video?

654
00:37:40,108 --> 00:37:40,489
Yeah.

655
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:41,289
Oh, yeah, right.

656
00:37:41,349 --> 00:37:41,489
Yeah.

657
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,009
So we got here.

658
00:37:42,029 --> 00:37:42,109
Yeah.

659
00:37:42,129 --> 00:37:42,369
No worries.

660
00:37:42,389 --> 00:37:42,529
Yeah.

661
00:37:42,589 --> 00:37:44,950
It kind of just goes over everything here.

662
00:37:56,362 --> 00:38:00,025
We are working on the Job Simulator and Fantastic Contraption trailers right now.

663
00:38:00,525 --> 00:38:04,388
They're the two of the three launch games that are coming out with the Vive.

664
00:38:07,751 --> 00:38:09,952
So when they approached me I was really, really excited about it.

665
00:38:09,992 --> 00:38:12,314
I mean, I just really wanted to be on board with this kind of thing.

666
00:38:12,881 --> 00:38:17,248
My background is in visual effects and I used to work on a whole bunch of different Hollywood movies.

667
00:38:17,569 --> 00:38:22,416
After I got out of the visual effects industry, I sort of transitioned into video games and started doing more motion graphics.

668
00:38:22,877 --> 00:38:27,544
But these two trailers are the first ones that really merged those skills in a really, really nice way.

669
00:38:29,263 --> 00:38:32,945
So generally speaking, I'm literally a one-man shop in my basement making game trailers,

670
00:38:32,985 --> 00:38:36,427
but for this, I knew we would need a green screen studio, we'd need a camera crew,

671
00:38:36,527 --> 00:38:38,648
we'd need people on set, we'd need actors.

672
00:38:38,768 --> 00:38:41,550
And so all of a sudden, your needs are just growing exponentially.

673
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:44,812
So I called Handcraft and they were like, yes, let's do this.

674
00:38:45,152 --> 00:38:47,793
And so then we started thinking, okay, what cameras are we going to shoot with?

675
00:38:47,893 --> 00:38:49,654
What are we going to use to stabilize the camera?

676
00:38:49,974 --> 00:38:52,677
We needed to figure out which camera would actually fit in the stabilizers,

677
00:38:52,757 --> 00:38:55,460
and how do we attach the third Vive controller to that,

678
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,143
and will that throw the camera off, and blah blah blah blah blah blah,

679
00:38:58,163 --> 00:38:59,525
it just keeps mounting on top, right?

680
00:39:00,386 --> 00:39:02,027
And we did that first test in the basement,

681
00:39:02,288 --> 00:39:04,230
and I put it on Twitter and it just exploded.

682
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,032
People were like, whoa, my God, this is crazy!

683
00:39:06,412 --> 00:39:07,674
And so we knew we were onto something.

684
00:39:08,495 --> 00:39:14,798
Today here we're recording VR trailers, which is kind of this new thing that people haven't had to think about before.

685
00:39:14,878 --> 00:39:17,880
And we're doing that with a green screen and doing some mixed reality stuff,

686
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,942
where we can kind of superimpose people into the actual game,

687
00:39:21,082 --> 00:39:24,084
with the hope of being able to explain to people what VR is like.

688
00:39:24,564 --> 00:39:29,787
Actually showing people inside VR for the first time, that's really, really magical,

689
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,749
and I think will kind of allow people to understand without trying it,

690
00:39:33,009 --> 00:39:34,950
just a little bit of what this stuff is going to be like.

691
00:39:36,139 --> 00:39:39,663
Job Simulator is a game coming out for all three VR platforms,

692
00:39:39,703 --> 00:39:43,046
the Vive, the Oculus with the Touch, and PlayStation VR.

693
00:39:43,146 --> 00:39:46,209
It's a game where robots have taken over all jobs.

694
00:39:46,229 --> 00:39:48,871
It's the year 2050, and so they created the simulator

695
00:39:48,891 --> 00:39:50,373
to simulate what jobs used to be like,

696
00:39:50,433 --> 00:39:52,715
so these future humans could experience what it was like to job.

697
00:39:53,155 --> 00:39:59,822
Fantastic Contraption is a video game for VR, where you use your hands and you walk around.

698
00:40:00,543 --> 00:40:03,707
And you make a contraption, so you make a machine.

699
00:40:03,807 --> 00:40:09,132
You use these simple tools, you use just wheels and sticks, and you basically try to get from over here to over there.

700
00:40:10,223 --> 00:40:14,145
Basically, every single time we would do a take on set, there was like this checklist

701
00:40:14,225 --> 00:40:15,765
of things that we would need to go through.

702
00:40:15,805 --> 00:40:19,406
So like the first thing we would do is make sure that the camera is rolling and then make

703
00:40:19,446 --> 00:40:21,587
sure that I'm capturing gameplay on the computer.

704
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:26,309
And we would have to get people to do a calibration of their hands with the controllers visible.

705
00:40:26,729 --> 00:40:30,850
And the reason we needed to do that is we needed some way to align the footage from

706
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:33,491
the gameplay and the camera in post-production.

707
00:40:34,462 --> 00:40:39,828
So the screen would be split up into a foreground layer, a background layer, a composited layer,

708
00:40:39,928 --> 00:40:42,931
and then what the player was actually seeing through the head-mount display.

709
00:40:43,292 --> 00:40:48,978
So we're capturing all four of these views live at the exact same time as they were playing.

710
00:40:49,889 --> 00:40:51,611
This is awesome. Kurt's crazy.

711
00:40:51,891 --> 00:40:55,516
As soon as we had our first Skype call with Kurt and he was telling us all his ideas,

712
00:40:56,276 --> 00:40:57,298
I was like, that's impossible.

713
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:02,423
And after we saw the first few of his screen tests, it was pretty mind-blowing.

714
00:41:02,804 --> 00:41:04,526
People aren't going to realize how much work this was.

715
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:06,508
It's like, oh, they shot it on a green screen, it's all computer.

716
00:41:06,528 --> 00:41:10,092
But no, what we actually did is we shot the gameplay live.

717
00:41:10,532 --> 00:41:13,514
So the gameplay was actually being captured at the exact same time.

718
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:16,715
We didn't go in and Cinema 4D or Maya and rebuild all this stuff.

719
00:41:16,995 --> 00:41:21,297
So literally it took two days of doing rough composites of every single one of these shots

720
00:41:21,377 --> 00:41:24,839
and just layering everything in, lining them all up exactly on the right frame

721
00:41:25,219 --> 00:41:28,080
and spitting that all out into this big collection of files.

722
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:32,242
Then once you have that, you can actually start looking at it and sifting through the footage.

723
00:41:33,922 --> 00:41:37,164
It's really the best way to showcase virtual reality.

724
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:42,267
It's the best way to show that that person is in that environment and manipulating those objects.

725
00:41:42,547 --> 00:41:45,689
And a lot of people just say you have to try it and really experience it.

726
00:41:45,849 --> 00:41:49,932
And I think that these mixed reality videos are the best way that we can

727
00:41:49,952 --> 00:41:53,514
get that feeling across, you know, in a 2D format without having the headset on.

728
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:57,371
Being involved in the first of these kind of things

729
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:58,532
is really, really fun.

730
00:41:58,592 --> 00:42:00,653
It's fun to work through all the technical problems.

731
00:42:00,693 --> 00:42:04,114
And it's fun to figure out how to shoot in VR

732
00:42:04,174 --> 00:42:06,135
and what things you need to do to make that look good.

733
00:42:06,515 --> 00:42:08,316
So it was stressful, but it was really exciting

734
00:42:08,376 --> 00:42:08,856
at the same time.

735
00:42:08,916 --> 00:42:09,696
All right, that's all we got.

736
00:42:09,716 --> 00:42:09,977
Thanks, guys.

737
00:42:10,057 --> 00:42:10,337
Thanks.

738
00:42:10,357 --> 00:42:10,597
Thank you.

739
00:42:10,617 --> 00:42:10,857
Thank you.

740
00:42:10,877 --> 00:42:11,117
Thank you.

741
00:42:11,477 --> 00:42:11,777
Thank you.

742
00:42:11,797 --> 00:42:12,037
Thank you.

743
00:42:13,658 --> 00:42:13,878
Thank you.

744
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:14,138
Thank you.

745
00:42:14,158 --> 00:42:14,358
Thank you.

746
00:42:14,378 --> 00:42:15,439
Thank you.

747
00:42:15,459 --> 00:42:15,679
Thank you.

748
00:42:21,641 --> 00:42:21,822
Thank you.

749
00:42:21,842 --> 00:42:22,062
Thank you.

750
00:42:22,082 --> 00:42:22,322
Thank you.

751
00:42:22,342 --> 00:42:22,622
Thank you.

752
00:42:22,642 --> 00:42:22,862
Thank you.

753
00:42:22,902 --> 00:42:23,122
Thank you.

754
00:42:23,142 --> 00:42:23,342
Thank you.

755
00:42:31,558 --> 00:42:33,998
Oh, if you have a question, I think you have to go up to the mics in order to ask them there.

756
00:42:37,059 --> 00:42:42,580
Hi. Can you guys talk about time and cost of the first two trailers that you guys did?

757
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:47,181
Well, it depends, right? It's all... The answer everyone will give you, like...

758
00:42:47,701 --> 00:42:51,622
Like, for a... I can't give you exact numbers, but I mean, like, it's not cheap.

759
00:42:51,662 --> 00:42:53,182
You can't do these for, like, a few grand, right?

760
00:42:53,222 --> 00:42:55,602
You've got, like, the overhead of, like, a studio and production.

761
00:42:55,642 --> 00:42:57,263
It's like, you're literally shooting a commercial

762
00:42:57,623 --> 00:42:59,543
with all the overhead that's involved

763
00:42:59,583 --> 00:43:01,143
because of all the people you need on set.

764
00:43:01,584 --> 00:43:13,698
Because you need like, there's like food, you have to pay, you have to bring people, you have to bring food, you have to have people for lighting, you have to pay someone to work the lights, you have to pay someone to work the camera, you have to have like, I was trying to do like three jobs at once, you have to have someone doing slating, so it's really, it's expensive.

765
00:43:13,718 --> 00:43:20,606
But it depends on what you need to do, like for Fantastic Contraption we did a couple, two days of shooting, one on the green screen set, we did another day in my house.

766
00:43:20,987 --> 00:43:22,967
If your game needs four or five environments,

767
00:43:23,127 --> 00:43:25,028
your costs are going up by four or five times

768
00:43:25,048 --> 00:43:27,648
because you need to shoot more days and that's more overhead.

769
00:43:27,808 --> 00:43:29,469
So it's really impossible to give a number

770
00:43:29,549 --> 00:43:31,409
until you know exactly what you want to do.

771
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:33,030
But yeah, it's not cheap.

772
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:34,390
But that being said, if you don't

773
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:36,371
want the quality of a professional trailer,

774
00:43:36,411 --> 00:43:37,151
you could do it yourself.

775
00:43:37,391 --> 00:43:39,552
Just do it in OBS and you can get some footage out there

776
00:43:39,592 --> 00:43:40,192
for fairly cheap.

777
00:43:40,212 --> 00:43:41,792
You can rent a green screen and just put it up

778
00:43:41,812 --> 00:43:43,533
in your basement and get something

779
00:43:43,593 --> 00:43:46,614
going that looks all right for a couple grand, just all in.

780
00:43:46,774 --> 00:43:46,974
Yeah.

781
00:43:48,646 --> 00:43:53,070
Also, avatar footage looks, I mean if you're more, if you're like really more budget conscious,

782
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:58,054
then I think filming in-game avatar stuff is, still looks really good and costs like

783
00:44:00,044 --> 00:44:02,965
Yeah, exactly. Like the in-game avatar stuff, I really, really like it.

784
00:44:03,025 --> 00:44:06,487
And especially for right now, when VR is at an infancy, kind of, you know,

785
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:08,807
and developers aren't making millions of dollars on their games,

786
00:44:08,827 --> 00:44:11,008
they can't throw five figures at a trailer, right?

787
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:15,550
So if you can do in-game avatar, all your cost is really is dev time

788
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:18,931
in order to make that in-game avatar look good and fit within your world.

789
00:44:19,451 --> 00:44:22,952
And so, yeah, it's definitely an approach that I can see a lot of people going with.

790
00:44:23,292 --> 00:44:24,973
And it still looks great. It's really, really cool.

791
00:44:26,278 --> 00:44:27,900
I love the movies that you do, they're really great.

792
00:44:28,301 --> 00:44:29,742
But just a technical question,

793
00:44:29,802 --> 00:44:35,568
why are you using a Z camera when it's a passive optical depth camera

794
00:44:35,609 --> 00:44:38,792
rather than something like a Kinect which is an active IR one

795
00:44:38,892 --> 00:44:40,474
and seems more suited for the range?

796
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:45,906
Yeah, so the reason they're using a Zed camera is because the IR camera is screwed with the

797
00:44:45,926 --> 00:44:46,547
Vive tracking.

798
00:44:47,048 --> 00:44:52,773
So yeah, it needs to be just purely depth-based rather than IR-based because, yeah, like I'm

799
00:44:53,554 --> 00:44:54,175
the alchemy guys.

800
00:44:54,215 --> 00:44:56,597
If you find them walking around or whatever, they could probably answer it in more depth.

801
00:44:56,838 --> 00:44:57,698
But that's the rough answer.

802
00:44:57,718 --> 00:44:58,319
Yeah, it's the IR.

803
00:45:01,293 --> 00:45:06,680
I followed your step-by-step with DSLR, but I was kind of transparent.

804
00:45:06,721 --> 00:45:08,623
I was wondering, I think it's my green screen.

805
00:45:08,643 --> 00:45:11,407
Do you guys recommend any green screen paint brands or anything?

806
00:45:12,529 --> 00:45:15,413
Well, you know, the green screen is really the least of your problems.

807
00:45:15,473 --> 00:45:16,014
It's the lighting.

808
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:17,816
Spend your money on lights.

809
00:45:18,176 --> 00:45:21,298
You can key any color as long as it's even.

810
00:45:21,758 --> 00:45:25,862
So if you can pay $600 to get the big friggin' light boxes

811
00:45:25,942 --> 00:45:28,283
and make them as big and diffuse as possible

812
00:45:28,744 --> 00:45:31,186
and get two of them so they're lighting your green screen

813
00:45:31,306 --> 00:45:33,948
evenly from each side, and then have a third light

814
00:45:34,048 --> 00:45:35,629
that's lighting your player from the front.

815
00:45:35,969 --> 00:45:37,991
And if you do that, you have the one light behind here,

816
00:45:38,011 --> 00:45:39,172
you have the player in the middle,

817
00:45:39,212 --> 00:45:40,853
and then you have the two lights on your green screen.

818
00:45:41,153 --> 00:45:43,515
That'll create the most even green that you possibly can.

819
00:45:43,795 --> 00:45:44,976
And then that will key out easily,

820
00:45:44,996 --> 00:45:46,457
and then it doesn't matter what color it is.

821
00:45:46,657 --> 00:45:48,438
Thank you, sir. Do you have a wattage for the lights?

822
00:45:49,218 --> 00:45:52,800
Bright as possible without blowing out the power in your apartment or wherever you're setting it up.

823
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,342
Perfect, thank you.

824
00:45:56,362 --> 00:45:58,803
G'day, I caught your talk at our Full Indie Summit last year.

825
00:45:58,823 --> 00:46:00,623
It's good to see some new stuff in this one as well.

826
00:46:00,743 --> 00:46:01,344
Cool, thanks.

827
00:46:01,924 --> 00:46:04,205
Quick question about props with hand controllers.

828
00:46:04,305 --> 00:46:04,505
Yeah.

829
00:46:04,625 --> 00:46:08,207
I noticed in a lot of your trailers you keep it basically to just the controller to show.

830
00:46:08,227 --> 00:46:13,069
Do you find any issues with actually putting the props in people's hands when you're trying to film things in mixed reality?

831
00:46:14,608 --> 00:46:18,110
Well, the biggest problem with that is the camera delay problem, right?

832
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:22,092
If you solve the camera delay problem, then you're like 90% of the way there.

833
00:46:22,872 --> 00:46:27,695
For Fantastic Attraction, it's actually really nice when people spend a lot of time grabbing these big wheels.

834
00:46:28,155 --> 00:46:31,477
And that actually hides the delay a lot, because you can't really see where their hand is going.

835
00:46:31,797 --> 00:46:32,537
So that works really well.

836
00:46:34,298 --> 00:46:49,961
I think the biggest problems with having like literally if you try to put like a gun or an apple in someone's hand is that they're 2 dimensional right there hand is like going to be on top of the Apple underneath the Apple or the opposite of that and so it's going to be hard to make that look really good.

837
00:46:51,106 --> 00:46:54,988
Yeah, like for Space Pirate Trainer, there's a number of reasons for, like,

838
00:46:55,108 --> 00:46:58,330
God, I could talk about the virtual cinematography stuff, that would be another talk, but

839
00:46:58,831 --> 00:47:02,713
you know, one of the reasons we went with in-game avatar over mixed reality for that

840
00:47:02,873 --> 00:47:07,056
is we wanted the player to look badass in that player, in that thing, and like, honestly,

841
00:47:07,096 --> 00:47:09,938
like, I can't find an actor that's going to look as cool as that avatar was.

842
00:47:10,338 --> 00:47:12,478
But one of the other problems is, yeah, you've got this gun.

843
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:16,739
So in the game, the gun goes all around your hand.

844
00:47:17,179 --> 00:47:20,240
But there's no easy way to composite live action footage

845
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,140
where it's actually going in properly

846
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:24,061
without doing a ton of rotoscoping in post

847
00:47:24,461 --> 00:47:25,341
to make that look right.

848
00:47:25,701 --> 00:47:28,182
So we just solved that problem by just doing an avatar.

849
00:47:28,302 --> 00:47:31,282
And I think if you're having problems like that, where

850
00:47:31,302 --> 00:47:33,743
you're holding giant objects, and your hand looks

851
00:47:33,763 --> 00:47:35,743
like it's swimming inside of it because you can't

852
00:47:35,763 --> 00:47:36,803
get that layering proper.

853
00:47:37,444 --> 00:47:38,585
Yeah, that's an issue, right?

854
00:47:38,645 --> 00:47:40,648
And some people will notice that and take issue

855
00:47:40,688 --> 00:47:41,509
with it more than others.

856
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:43,632
For me that worked in VFX, I see that kind of stuff

857
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:44,714
and it makes me want to puke.

858
00:47:44,754 --> 00:47:46,416
So it's just like, I need to fix that.

859
00:47:46,476 --> 00:47:50,442
And so you have to sort of look at what's best for your game.

860
00:47:50,482 --> 00:47:52,224
And maybe a different option would be best

861
00:47:52,605 --> 00:47:53,646
to fix the hand problem.

862
00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:57,081
If you were using one gun, you could probably just actually make one.

863
00:47:57,561 --> 00:48:01,124
You could make a prop, but then it's got to line up really, really close.

864
00:48:01,164 --> 00:48:03,225
And you've got to get a really dead-on calibration.

865
00:48:03,265 --> 00:48:06,248
And that's really tough, too, depending on the amount of time you have to throw at this.

866
00:48:06,748 --> 00:48:09,710
So, yeah, there's no real easy solution to that problem right now.

867
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:12,632
Maybe you could put green gloves on or something and make your hands invisible.

868
00:48:12,652 --> 00:48:14,514
I don't know. Or make the whole Vive controller green.

869
00:48:14,574 --> 00:48:15,615
That might work, too.

870
00:48:16,836 --> 00:48:18,437
Someone could experiment with that. Maybe. I don't know.

871
00:48:19,398 --> 00:48:19,958
Thank you very much.

872
00:48:19,978 --> 00:48:20,438
Yeah, no problem.

873
00:48:21,434 --> 00:48:36,456
Hey guys, I was wondering when you're rendering for the trailers themselves and you're outputting all four images, are you doing it to a video capture card? Or is it just so yeah, like when we did the trailer, we didn't use a capture card.

874
00:48:37,236 --> 00:48:44,120
Collins game is light enough that we were basically able to render the two views for the head mount display and the four quads.

875
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:49,363
I was rendering at 2560x1440 which gave me four 720p quads.

876
00:48:49,863 --> 00:48:51,904
And his game is light enough that we were able to do that.

877
00:48:51,924 --> 00:48:53,865
The head mount display was getting 90 frames a second.

878
00:48:53,905 --> 00:48:55,586
I was getting 60 frames a second on the computer.

879
00:48:56,026 --> 00:48:59,688
And I just used Bandicam to record the in-game footage just on the computer.

880
00:49:00,068 --> 00:49:02,910
And it has like a video card GPU encoder on it.

881
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:05,731
And so you can hook up to it and it just worked.

882
00:49:05,931 --> 00:49:06,552
It worked well.

883
00:49:06,852 --> 00:49:08,933
But that being said, if your game is like raw data

884
00:49:09,073 --> 00:49:10,534
or something insane that's already

885
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:13,095
struggling to hit 90 frames a second inside of the Vive,

886
00:49:13,796 --> 00:49:15,557
you're going to have problems because now you're

887
00:49:15,597 --> 00:49:16,657
rendering everything else.

888
00:49:17,078 --> 00:49:18,618
You're rendering it again four times.

889
00:49:18,658 --> 00:49:20,680
And if you're doing smooth head-mount display,

890
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,461
now you're rendering another camera

891
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:23,301
for the head-mount display.

892
00:49:23,341 --> 00:49:25,422
So yeah, there's a lot of overhead involved there.

893
00:49:25,742 --> 00:49:26,983
The least of your problems is going

894
00:49:27,003 --> 00:49:28,484
to be the overhead of capturing the footage.

895
00:49:29,024 --> 00:49:31,646
Your main problem is going to be maintaining frame rate.

896
00:49:32,046 --> 00:49:33,567
For the footage in general, right?

897
00:49:34,348 --> 00:49:37,570
So a capture card, yeah, definitely can offload a little bit of that load.

898
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:41,033
But honestly, that's the least of most people's problems.

899
00:49:41,133 --> 00:49:42,974
Just maintaining frame rate is the biggest issue.

900
00:49:43,154 --> 00:49:46,717
So from a streamer's point of view, i think it's a little worse even.

901
00:49:47,978 --> 00:49:50,680
It's a real downside of the quarter screen technique.

902
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:53,401
As Kurt says, you have to render your game at like 4K

903
00:49:53,481 --> 00:49:54,302
with multiple cameras.

904
00:49:54,502 --> 00:49:56,283
And you do the capturing and the streaming

905
00:49:56,303 --> 00:49:57,003
all on the same machine.

906
00:49:57,324 --> 00:49:59,625
And so the problem with using a capture card

907
00:49:59,645 --> 00:50:02,647
and offloading that to another machine, which a lot of streamers

908
00:50:02,987 --> 00:50:05,949
already do, is you lose the alpha information out

909
00:50:05,989 --> 00:50:06,349
of the game.

910
00:50:08,674 --> 00:50:13,397
So OBS is, if you use game mode in OBS to capture a game,

911
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:16,039
then it'll get the alpha information out of Unity.

912
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:18,620
And so that'll be your partial transparencies will be perfect.

913
00:50:19,121 --> 00:50:22,463
But if you push it through a capture card, then you lose

914
00:50:22,503 --> 00:50:24,004
that, and you'll have to do a key on it, which

915
00:50:24,044 --> 00:50:24,744
doesn't look as good.

916
00:50:25,905 --> 00:50:29,747
Thank you guys.

917
00:50:29,987 --> 00:50:31,008
Thanks guys, great talk.

918
00:50:32,149 --> 00:50:35,691
Do you have any strategies for non-Unity game engines?

919
00:50:38,011 --> 00:50:38,151
No.

920
00:50:38,651 --> 00:50:38,852
No.

921
00:50:39,412 --> 00:50:39,612
Yeah.

922
00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:42,874
Well, I mean, there are people that are doing it in Unreal.

923
00:50:43,534 --> 00:50:46,676
I think they're modifying the source code to Unreal to actually make this work.

924
00:50:47,736 --> 00:50:50,718
I remember I was talking to another developer and he was like, yeah, they said they were

925
00:50:50,738 --> 00:50:54,960
going to put mixed reality in Unity like a year ago and we're, you know, still not there.

926
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:55,541
So I don't know.

927
00:50:55,921 --> 00:50:59,143
I think eventually they will do it because it's like the obvious thing to do.

928
00:50:59,303 --> 00:51:00,864
I don't know why it's not on Unreal yet.

929
00:51:00,904 --> 00:51:03,425
I mean, like they've got billions of dollars and tons of programmers.

930
00:51:03,485 --> 00:51:04,666
It should take them a weekend or whatever.

931
00:51:05,026 --> 00:51:10,011
Right? So maybe there's some fundamental flaw there in Unreal that's making it harder to do,

932
00:51:10,091 --> 00:51:12,473
but I don't know. There are games that have done it, though.

933
00:51:12,493 --> 00:51:17,117
The Everest guys have a mixed reality trailer that was done in it, so it's possible

934
00:51:17,457 --> 00:51:19,179
there's just going to be more overhead involved.

935
00:51:19,339 --> 00:51:21,060
Yeah, it seems like they're all custom solutions right now.

936
00:51:21,401 --> 00:51:21,521
Yeah.

937
00:51:22,257 --> 00:51:25,439
Hey guys, fantastic talk. This was a really, really great session.

938
00:51:26,279 --> 00:51:28,661
I just had a question about when you're directing the actors,

939
00:51:29,662 --> 00:51:31,883
when they're wearing the helmet, what's your process for that?

940
00:51:31,923 --> 00:51:34,685
Do you show them the gameplay on a computer first?

941
00:51:35,325 --> 00:51:39,308
Yeah, so for the Contraption trailer, I mean, the vibe wasn't even out yet, right?

942
00:51:39,908 --> 00:51:42,530
None of the VR headsets were out when we shot this thing.

943
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:45,611
And so none of them had even tried VR yet, right?

944
00:51:45,651 --> 00:51:50,813
And so I purposely got friends to help that I knew would be enthusiastic about this,

945
00:51:50,973 --> 00:51:53,574
and that I knew would be comfortable in front of a camera, too,

946
00:51:53,674 --> 00:51:55,155
and that would also take direction.

947
00:51:55,595 --> 00:52:01,077
And those are three really key things, and honestly, that's really hard to find in people.

948
00:52:01,457 --> 00:52:03,358
People freeze up in front of cameras.

949
00:52:03,498 --> 00:52:04,618
These were just friends that I had.

950
00:52:05,878 --> 00:52:08,240
And, you know, like a lot of people just aren't comfortable taking direction.

951
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:12,182
They're not comfortable feeling comfortable in front of a camera when there's people watching,

952
00:52:12,222 --> 00:52:13,303
even when they got a thing on, right?

953
00:52:13,823 --> 00:52:16,264
So yeah, we rehearsed.

954
00:52:16,725 --> 00:52:19,486
Like I brought them over to my house, you know, we spent an afternoon.

955
00:52:19,746 --> 00:52:23,669
Each of them played the game for like an hour or two, you know, to get comfortable in there,

956
00:52:23,749 --> 00:52:25,149
to understand what we were doing.

957
00:52:25,209 --> 00:52:26,390
I showed them the shot list.

958
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:28,812
Here's the things that you will be doing when we go on set.

959
00:52:29,192 --> 00:52:32,834
We rehearsed them, we showed them, and just because you need to be comfortable doing that,

960
00:52:33,254 --> 00:52:34,595
We were like, okay, do this thing, do this thing live.

961
00:52:34,615 --> 00:52:35,995
It's like, no, that's not working, do it like this.

962
00:52:36,275 --> 00:52:38,396
That creates pressure on the person when they're on set.

963
00:52:38,436 --> 00:52:39,817
You need to make them feel comfortable.

964
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,637
And this is like a directing thing.

965
00:52:41,697 --> 00:52:44,418
It's like like it's filmmaking basically at this point.

966
00:52:44,919 --> 00:52:47,179
So there's a lot to think about.

967
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:51,101
And dealing with actors is a very, very big headache, which

968
00:52:51,321 --> 00:52:52,081
I shouldn't say headache.

969
00:52:52,301 --> 00:52:54,642
If you find the right people, which we did fortunately, it

970
00:52:54,842 --> 00:52:55,883
Worked out very, very well.

971
00:52:55,963 --> 00:52:58,344
But if you don't have the right people, it can turn into a big

972
00:52:59,184 --> 00:53:03,825
Which is sort of another sort of point in the direction towards in-game avatars.

973
00:53:04,065 --> 00:53:08,026
Because then it's just you and one person not with the pressures of being on a green screen set

974
00:53:08,066 --> 00:53:10,626
and having a dozen other people around waiting for you.

975
00:53:10,646 --> 00:53:13,347
And you're screwing up and yada yada yada, right?

976
00:53:13,867 --> 00:53:16,307
So, yeah, that's a can of worms. Thanks.

977
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:19,968
I actually think performance stuff and streaming is a super interesting question.

978
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:24,729
And there's like a galaxy of tools that are eventually, and like techniques that are going to be built for that.

979
00:53:25,089 --> 00:53:26,069
So like in Contraption...

980
00:53:27,026 --> 00:53:32,469
Like one of the basic tools is being able to read your Twitch stream.

981
00:53:32,649 --> 00:53:35,770
Like if you're a Twitch streamer you have to be able to interact with your audience there.

982
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:42,833
And then we also have multiple cameras that you can switch to and direct your own experience.

983
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:47,315
And I think that's all going to end up being really important.

984
00:53:48,056 --> 00:53:53,058
It kind of shows how much work was just done, like the very toddler beginning of all this.

985
00:53:54,079 --> 00:54:00,067
Now we have to figure out how to do it basically, but then the real questions and the real tools are going to be how do you get expressive performance and...

986
00:54:00,367 --> 00:54:10,000
Yeah. And one of the interesting things, like Alchemy just had a new blog post about the latest and greatest with their Alchemy VR stuff, and one of the things they've added is actually like a live in-game composite...

987
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,943
Of you in VR that you can see while you are in the head-mount display.

988
00:54:13,983 --> 00:54:19,926
So what it is, it's like a screen, floating screen, that is like the final composite of what the streamer is seeing,

989
00:54:20,287 --> 00:54:24,569
but you can see it in VR. So you can see how you're fitting into that in-game world.

990
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:27,691
And that's really key too, because like you're blind when you're in there, right?

991
00:54:27,711 --> 00:54:30,013
You don't know what the viewer is seeing, but now they've got that,

992
00:54:30,053 --> 00:54:35,096
so they're kind of piping the output back into Unity somehow with not a lot of lag out.

993
00:54:35,136 --> 00:54:35,957
It's like magic, right?

994
00:54:36,157 --> 00:54:38,019
Yeah, and Mixcast has the same tool.

995
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,421
I think that's really valuable.

996
00:54:39,461 --> 00:54:44,807
Yeah, that's super valuable because you need to see how you look to your audience, especially if you're a streamer.

997
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:50,534
Do you know how many people are using the Mixed Reality for streaming?

998
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:56,501
Are most people just using straight eye output with your game, or are a lot of people doing Mixed Reality?

999
00:54:56,772 --> 00:54:59,313
So there are very few mixed reality streamers right now.

1000
00:54:59,353 --> 00:55:00,733
There's not that many VR streamers.

1001
00:55:01,333 --> 00:55:04,034
I don't understand the streaming ecosystem as well

1002
00:55:04,114 --> 00:55:05,255
as many people do.

1003
00:55:05,595 --> 00:55:07,776
But I think a lot of that is because there aren't that many

1004
00:55:08,376 --> 00:55:09,976
VR headsets out yet.

1005
00:55:10,177 --> 00:55:12,477
And people that watch games are people that usually play

1006
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:14,218
games, rather than watching games that they've

1007
00:55:14,238 --> 00:55:14,878
never seen before.

1008
00:55:17,169 --> 00:55:19,871
Right now people are doing interesting stuff.

1009
00:55:20,391 --> 00:55:22,853
Oz at Upload VR is making really interesting videos.

1010
00:55:22,893 --> 00:55:23,914
They do a lot of Tilt Brush stuff.

1011
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:27,456
And that's almost entirely done with the Steam tool.

1012
00:55:28,257 --> 00:55:32,259
And so they end up doing a lot more post videos than actually

1013
00:55:32,299 --> 00:55:35,161
streaming, because the Steam tool is much better as a post

1014
00:55:35,201 --> 00:55:37,323
tool than it is as a live tool.

1015
00:55:38,244 --> 00:55:41,986
The one thing I'll say, though, it's like I know when Contraption came out, like, and it launched,

1016
00:55:42,687 --> 00:55:47,110
like, all I saw were people streaming fantastic Contraption videos because it was this new thing.

1017
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:52,974
Right? They were able to get on green screen and they were able to do this, and it's something new that your audience, like, as a streamer,

1018
00:55:53,434 --> 00:55:56,196
can see that no other streamer is really doing, right?

1019
00:55:56,256 --> 00:56:03,160
So it was this really neat way for them to bring in viewers, and they're like, some of the videos had like, like, bazillions of views because they were the first ones to really get it up and working.

1020
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:05,401
And I remember getting emails from, like, streamers like,

1021
00:56:05,702 --> 00:56:07,403
And then you do the calibration, and I'm having trouble,

1022
00:56:07,443 --> 00:56:07,943
blah, blah, blah.

1023
00:56:07,963 --> 00:56:09,144
And people are all trying to figure it out

1024
00:56:09,164 --> 00:56:09,965
at the same time, right?

1025
00:56:10,365 --> 00:56:11,746
So that's kind of died down a little bit.

1026
00:56:11,806 --> 00:56:14,008
Now the tools are starting to gel,

1027
00:56:14,088 --> 00:56:16,310
and the techniques are starting to get a little bit easier.

1028
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:18,291
But yeah, initially, it seemed like there

1029
00:56:18,311 --> 00:56:21,293
was a lot of interest for streamers jumping on board.

1030
00:56:21,413 --> 00:56:23,115
Yeah, and we did our like second stream.

1031
00:56:23,135 --> 00:56:24,876
We did our first stream and someone at Twitch was like,

1032
00:56:24,916 --> 00:56:25,456
what the fuck?

1033
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:27,958
And then they were like, what are you doing this again?

1034
00:56:27,978 --> 00:56:29,438
And we're like, I don't know, next Tuesday.

1035
00:56:29,539 --> 00:56:31,100
And so they like put us on the front page

1036
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:32,981
and we had like 3,000 people in the stream.

1037
00:56:33,101 --> 00:56:34,282
And it was very surprising to us.

1038
00:56:34,722 --> 00:56:36,883
But that tapered off pretty quickly.

1039
00:56:36,983 --> 00:56:39,565
And I think the reason is we're just not good streamers.

1040
00:56:39,665 --> 00:56:43,587
Like I think for a stream of VR to be really compelling,

1041
00:56:43,607 --> 00:56:43,948
you need...

1042
00:56:44,648 --> 00:56:48,891
Not a webcam, you need like a real camera, and you need, yeah, good lighting and a good key.

1043
00:56:49,251 --> 00:56:55,335
And then you just need to, you know, be the, like, YouTuber, streamer person who's like really performative.

1044
00:56:55,727 --> 00:56:57,508
Yeah, and that's like an extra layer, right?

1045
00:56:57,829 --> 00:56:58,189
It's like...

1046
00:56:58,449 --> 00:56:59,170
That's their job.

1047
00:56:59,190 --> 00:56:59,910
That's their job.

1048
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:00,771
Like, their job...

1049
00:57:00,791 --> 00:57:03,694
When you're a YouTube streamer, or like a Twitch streamer, you're a performer.

1050
00:57:03,834 --> 00:57:04,274
Yeah.

1051
00:57:04,574 --> 00:57:06,596
But now you're like a full-body performer.

1052
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:08,338
It's not just what's coming out of your mouth.

1053
00:57:08,398 --> 00:57:11,921
It's your whole body and your acting, and that's just another level of...

1054
00:57:12,281 --> 00:57:16,005
So it's really the entire point is to give the tools, after we get past the basics,

1055
00:57:16,065 --> 00:57:17,906
is to give the tools for people to give good performance.

1056
00:57:17,946 --> 00:57:18,106
Yeah.

1057
00:57:18,974 --> 00:57:19,935
Hey guys, great talk.

1058
00:57:21,016 --> 00:57:21,576
Just a question.

1059
00:57:21,616 --> 00:57:24,718
This might be one of those areas where you go just go with the avatar.

1060
00:57:25,899 --> 00:57:30,182
But have you guys ever looked at trying to put in-game lighting

1061
00:57:30,362 --> 00:57:32,183
onto the mixed reality avatar?

1062
00:57:33,884 --> 00:57:35,386
Is that too hard?

1063
00:57:35,406 --> 00:57:36,987
Well, that's what Alchemy's tool does.

1064
00:57:37,307 --> 00:57:41,530
So they have magic, basically, that takes that z-depth information

1065
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:43,731
that they were getting from the zed camera.

1066
00:57:44,292 --> 00:57:46,152
And turns that into normal information or something

1067
00:57:46,172 --> 00:57:46,492
like that.

1068
00:57:46,572 --> 00:57:49,333
And then basically, they're able to do in-game interactive

1069
00:57:49,353 --> 00:57:49,953
lighting that way.

1070
00:57:50,473 --> 00:57:52,714
So if you check out their latest post

1071
00:57:52,734 --> 00:57:56,214
that they had a day or two ago, the first post they did

1072
00:57:56,234 --> 00:57:57,275
was like, yeah, it looks all right.

1073
00:57:57,315 --> 00:57:59,195
But the new one is like, holy crap.

1074
00:57:59,275 --> 00:58:01,496
The lighting is really dead on.

1075
00:58:01,536 --> 00:58:03,376
So I don't know what they fixed or what they improved.

1076
00:58:03,676 --> 00:58:05,436
But they've got this raver set up

1077
00:58:05,456 --> 00:58:07,217
where they've got two balls like this, and they're going like

1078
00:58:07,257 --> 00:58:09,297
this, and they've got flames, and they've got stuff.

1079
00:58:09,397 --> 00:58:10,718
In-game lighting is amazing.

1080
00:58:10,758 --> 00:58:12,778
And that's one of the big advantages, actually,

1081
00:58:12,858 --> 00:58:13,858
of doing it in-game.

1082
00:58:14,219 --> 00:58:16,441
Doing that in post is a major pain in the ass.

1083
00:58:16,762 --> 00:58:18,784
And what they did actually for the Tilt Brush trailer

1084
00:58:19,225 --> 00:58:22,889
is they had a guy with like an LED ball on like a boom

1085
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:25,252
that was like, you know, trying to like go like this

1086
00:58:25,372 --> 00:58:27,394
and matching it and they just rotoscoped it out in post

1087
00:58:27,434 --> 00:58:29,356
to get the in-game like lighting matching

1088
00:58:29,376 --> 00:58:30,298
the live action person.

1089
00:58:30,658 --> 00:58:35,461
And you can do that in a post with After Effects and things like that too, but it's never going to look as good as the lighting in game.

1090
00:58:35,801 --> 00:58:41,565
But the problem is, is with the Z camera, you're using these crappy little webcams essentially as like your image,

1091
00:58:41,925 --> 00:58:44,206
as opposed to like a full frame sensor on a DSLR.

1092
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:48,709
So you're not getting as good of an image, but you're getting that really good interactive lighting, right?

1093
00:58:48,749 --> 00:58:54,393
So there's like all these trade-offs with each of these methods, and there's no one clear winner depending on...

1094
00:58:54,493 --> 00:58:55,633
It all depends on what you want to do.

1095
00:58:55,893 --> 00:58:58,335
Yeah, and that Tilt Brush video was done with a crazy technique, right?

1096
00:58:58,395 --> 00:58:58,475
Yeah.

1097
00:58:58,495 --> 00:59:00,616
Where they actually tracked in space where the camera was.

1098
00:59:00,656 --> 00:59:03,837
Yeah, the Tilt Brush, I could talk for like half an hour on how they did the Tilt Brush trailer,

1099
00:59:03,897 --> 00:59:05,338
but it's not like what we did.

1100
00:59:05,398 --> 00:59:08,219
They did like, it was more of a post-visual effects approach.

1101
00:59:08,259 --> 00:59:12,021
What they, like, the short version, they tracked the camera

1102
00:59:12,961 --> 00:59:15,402
and then brought the camera information into Unity

1103
00:59:15,442 --> 00:59:16,803
and then like replayed out of Unity

1104
00:59:16,923 --> 00:59:19,184
and it's like, it's this insane setup, so yeah.

1105
00:59:20,336 --> 00:59:21,916
I mean, I think that's a really good point is like,

1106
00:59:22,637 --> 00:59:24,978
there's still tons of room for creative problem solving.

1107
00:59:25,178 --> 00:59:25,378
Yeah.

1108
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:27,820
Like, these are the techniques that people

1109
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:28,700
are kind of using right now.

1110
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:32,422
But I mean, I'm sure people in this room are like, well,

1111
00:59:32,442 --> 00:59:33,523
I don't know why they didn't just do it

1112
00:59:33,563 --> 00:59:34,524
like this and like that.

1113
00:59:34,584 --> 00:59:36,705
And that's probably like, maybe that's the future

1114
00:59:36,745 --> 00:59:37,545
of how we're all going to do it.

1115
00:59:37,665 --> 00:59:38,326
Maybe that's the thing.

1116
00:59:38,346 --> 00:59:39,827
It's still pretty early days.

1117
00:59:40,687 --> 00:59:42,068
I hope someone makes it better and easier,

1118
00:59:42,088 --> 00:59:43,569
because that would just make it better for everyone.

1119
00:59:43,649 --> 00:59:44,469
Yeah, definitely.

1120
00:59:44,509 --> 00:59:47,851
