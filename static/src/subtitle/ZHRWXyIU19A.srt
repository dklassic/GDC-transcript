00:00:07,085 --> 00:00:09,187
Hello everyone, my name's Andrew Barron.

2
00:00:09,447 --> 00:00:12,489
I'm the Director of Design at Bohemia Interactive Simulations

3
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:16,011
and my talk is called Depiction of War in Games.

4
00:00:16,331 --> 00:00:17,112
Can you do better?

5
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,174
For those of you who don't know,

6
00:00:20,194 --> 00:00:22,055
Bohemia Interactive Simulations,

7
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,657
we've taken the first person shooter game engine

8
00:00:24,697 --> 00:00:26,398
behind the Arma series of games

9
00:00:27,078 --> 00:00:30,320
and turned it into a real life military simulator

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,502
that's used to train thousands of soldiers

11
00:00:32,542 --> 00:00:34,103
around the world each year.

12
00:00:36,312 --> 00:00:42,954
My whole professional career, I've been in and around simulations, the military itself, and war.

13
00:00:42,974 --> 00:00:50,957
A little bit about myself, I started off as a modder in 2002 for Bohemian Interactive's first game, Operation Flashpoint.

14
00:00:51,957 --> 00:00:52,958
In 2006, I got a job as a designer.

15
00:00:55,657 --> 00:00:59,118
in their Australian studio, and we started working on Virtual

16
00:00:59,158 --> 00:00:59,638
Battlespace 2.

17
00:01:00,678 --> 00:01:03,679
This was the military simulator that really

18
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,380
changed the defense industry.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,761
It became a breakaway success and really changed the way

20
00:01:10,902 --> 00:01:12,302
that the military thought of games.

21
00:01:12,902 --> 00:01:14,923
They could be serious training tools, not just

22
00:01:14,943 --> 00:01:16,543
some experiment or some toy.

23
00:01:18,471 --> 00:01:21,233
In 2010, I moved to Orlando when we opened a studio there.

24
00:01:22,134 --> 00:01:24,295
But I was also in the United States Marine Corps Reserve.

25
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,058
And so again, in 2010, I actually

26
00:01:27,098 --> 00:01:29,960
volunteered for a deployment to Afghanistan.

27
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,282
So I was there for about seven months.

28
00:01:33,103 --> 00:01:36,005
And then afterwards, I decided I want to go back to Afghanistan.

29
00:01:36,045 --> 00:01:38,908
So I went there as a civilian working for DARPA.

30
00:01:39,268 --> 00:01:42,311
We were making smartphone apps for soldiers to use in combat.

31
00:01:43,112 --> 00:01:45,095
After a year, I decided I was tired of that,

32
00:01:45,336 --> 00:01:47,400
and I went back to work for Bohemia,

33
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,825
this time in the Prague office.

34
00:01:50,225 --> 00:01:51,788
And there goes my slides.

35
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:52,129
All right.

36
00:01:53,752 --> 00:01:54,774
And I've been in Prague ever since.

37
00:01:55,922 --> 00:02:01,605
So one of the things that I've noticed in my time in defense,

38
00:02:01,845 --> 00:02:03,486
in simulations, and around the military

39
00:02:03,546 --> 00:02:05,448
is that there's a bit of a disconnect

40
00:02:05,508 --> 00:02:09,630
between the expectation and reality of how

41
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,653
war is depicted in games and in books and movies

42
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:14,894
compared to how it actually is.

43
00:02:15,914 --> 00:02:19,456
And as a veteran, usually for me, when I talk to civilians,

44
00:02:19,856 --> 00:02:21,637
this is kind of how the conversations go.

45
00:02:22,398 --> 00:02:23,458
You know, it might start off like,

46
00:02:23,498 --> 00:02:24,619
hey, I'm off to boot camp.

47
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:25,819
Wish me luck, buddy.

48
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,541
And then the friend's just kind of not interested.

49
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:30,782
Awesome, kill some bad guys for me.

50
00:02:31,843 --> 00:02:34,224
Two years later, I just got back from Iraq.

51
00:02:34,424 --> 00:02:38,306
I had a lot of profound and life-changing experiences.

52
00:02:38,966 --> 00:02:41,247
Friend, cool, did you kill anyone?

53
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:42,928
Not very interested.

54
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:49,216
So in general, I would say people have a deep appreciation

55
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,421
for the military, but a very shallow understanding

56
00:02:52,642 --> 00:02:55,827
of what it is the military does and war itself.

57
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,932
And for example.

58
00:03:00,162 --> 00:03:03,683
When I was in Afghanistan, I was deployed to the Sangin District.

59
00:03:04,003 --> 00:03:06,564
And for years, Sangin was the bloodiest battleground

60
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:07,445
in the entire war.

61
00:03:07,925 --> 00:03:09,986
Units that were deployed there were suffering 10% to 20%

62
00:03:10,366 --> 00:03:12,367
casualties each deployment.

63
00:03:12,747 --> 00:03:14,088
Ours was no exception.

64
00:03:14,508 --> 00:03:16,349
And one of the reasons it was so bloody

65
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:17,529
is there were IEDs everywhere.

66
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:19,690
It was basically a low-density minefield.

67
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,011
So we would walk in single-file line like this.

68
00:03:22,732 --> 00:03:24,312
The guy in front would have a mind sweeper.

69
00:03:24,393 --> 00:03:26,253
Everyone else would walk behind in line.

70
00:03:27,154 --> 00:03:29,795
And if you stepped off of the path that had been cleared,

71
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:30,736
you might get blown up.

72
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:34,137
Or sometimes the guy in front might miss an IED,

73
00:03:34,157 --> 00:03:36,519
he might step over it, and then the next guy in line

74
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:38,360
might step on it and get blown up.

75
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:43,801
uh... before i got there uh... the last unit that was there they learned the

76
00:03:43,821 --> 00:03:47,324
hard way that the insurgents uh... had a little tactic where they would put

77
00:03:47,444 --> 00:03:48,204
ideas down

78
00:03:48,224 --> 00:03:52,167
uh... behind cover so good places to take cover and then they would set up an

79
00:03:52,227 --> 00:03:52,527
ambush

80
00:03:53,027 --> 00:03:54,008
and when the marines came

81
00:03:54,448 --> 00:03:55,529
they would fire at the marines

82
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,652
marines would run to cover lay down in those places and in the insurgents would

83
00:03:59,832 --> 00:04:01,874
detonate the IEDs and blow up the marines

84
00:04:02,334 --> 00:04:03,555
so by the time we got there

85
00:04:04,095 --> 00:04:07,197
we were told if you come under enemy fire you just stand still

86
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:09,960
and you just squat down, you fire back,

87
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,201
and you don't run for cover.

88
00:04:11,902 --> 00:04:14,484
So that's pretty much what we were deploying into.

89
00:04:15,085 --> 00:04:17,687
And you might imagine from what I described

90
00:04:17,747 --> 00:04:19,669
that it must have looked something like this.

91
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:22,832
You know, a lot of shooting, a lot of explosions,

92
00:04:23,413 --> 00:04:24,114
exciting stuff.

93
00:04:25,135 --> 00:04:27,117
In reality though, a typical day there

94
00:04:27,197 --> 00:04:28,858
looked a lot more like this.

95
00:04:32,316 --> 00:04:34,198
We'd basically be walking around talking to farmers

96
00:04:34,218 --> 00:04:37,442
about their donkey or about their house that was destroyed.

97
00:04:37,462 --> 00:04:41,507
In a low-density minefield, but just walking around talking.

98
00:04:41,967 --> 00:04:43,109
And in the middle of this deployment,

99
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:45,392
there was a young Marine, I remember very clearly,

100
00:04:45,472 --> 00:04:46,613
he had this quote.

101
00:04:47,674 --> 00:04:50,317
He said, this isn't what I expected.

102
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:52,680
I thought I'd be doing hero shit, like in Call of Duty.

103
00:04:55,755 --> 00:04:59,878
So what you might not realize is that your work as writers

104
00:05:00,198 --> 00:05:02,380
and as game developers really matters.

105
00:05:03,201 --> 00:05:05,722
It really helps set the expectation

106
00:05:05,762 --> 00:05:10,586
that society has of what war is and what the military is.

107
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:13,428
And the reason for this is because, as people,

108
00:05:13,528 --> 00:05:16,610
we're designed to learn through stories and through play

109
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,631
and through emotions.

110
00:05:18,211 --> 00:05:21,433
We don't learn from history or long-form journalism.

111
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:22,756
Unfortunately.

112
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:27,019
So really, you are society's teachers, in a way.

113
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,402
So my question is, what lessons are we teaching?

114
00:05:32,163 --> 00:05:32,984
Let's take an analogy.

115
00:05:33,805 --> 00:05:35,246
Let's say we were tasked with writing

116
00:05:35,286 --> 00:05:36,627
a movie about relationships.

117
00:05:37,148 --> 00:05:39,289
This is something that most of us have all experienced.

118
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:41,631
So we could brainstorm a lot of different themes

119
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:43,853
or different narrative topics that we could focus on.

120
00:05:44,413 --> 00:05:48,597
You know, love, dating, romance, maybe heartbreak, marriage.

121
00:05:49,665 --> 00:05:51,426
We have this huge narrative canvas

122
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:53,788
that we can choose from to write about.

123
00:05:54,808 --> 00:05:57,830
Now, what if, as we're brainstorming,

124
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,792
a movie executive comes up to us and says, hey,

125
00:06:00,832 --> 00:06:02,433
we did a lot of market research.

126
00:06:02,614 --> 00:06:05,475
And we've learned what excites our audience the most.

127
00:06:06,696 --> 00:06:10,799
I want you to focus just on this one theme, sex.

128
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,381
What kind of movie would be writing you at this point?

129
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,936
I mean, obviously, obviously we'd be making porn at this point.

130
00:06:19,396 --> 00:06:22,417
Which may be exciting, but it's a bit shallow.

131
00:06:23,318 --> 00:06:27,199
And although in a relationship, often there is sex, of course,

132
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:31,721
but you wouldn't really say that a porn is about relationships.

133
00:06:33,782 --> 00:06:36,023
So let's say we're gonna write about war.

134
00:06:36,923 --> 00:06:39,184
How big is our narrative canvas?

135
00:06:39,444 --> 00:06:42,746
What are all the themes that we tend to choose from when we're writing?

136
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:46,751
I would argue that it's fairly narrow most of the time.

137
00:06:47,732 --> 00:06:48,952
And really the purpose of this speech

138
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,594
is to give you a few examples of what else is out there,

139
00:06:52,054 --> 00:06:53,916
what else we can fit in this narrative.

140
00:06:54,676 --> 00:06:57,898
So to get started, my first narrative is less killing,

141
00:06:58,679 --> 00:06:59,179
more war.

142
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,200
What do I mean by that?

143
00:07:02,366 --> 00:07:04,728
One of the things I've found over the years that's

144
00:07:04,748 --> 00:07:06,969
very interesting about working on military simulations

145
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,132
is the difference between what's really in a military FPS

146
00:07:10,532 --> 00:07:12,694
versus what gamers think must be in there.

147
00:07:13,154 --> 00:07:15,035
And I would say, in general, video games

148
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:18,338
are much, much more violent than real military operations

149
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:19,539
or military simulations.

150
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,261
And I mean orders of magnitude more violent.

151
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:24,662
So for example, when the military's

152
00:07:24,682 --> 00:07:27,263
going to attack something, some defenders that

153
00:07:27,283 --> 00:07:29,064
are in a dug-in position, typically they

154
00:07:29,104 --> 00:07:32,305
want to use three times as many soldiers as the defenders have.

155
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:36,567
So if there's 30 defenders, you would attack with 90 soldiers.

156
00:07:37,688 --> 00:07:40,649
So let's say we have a level in a video game

157
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:42,230
where we're going to attack an enemy base,

158
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,570
and we're going to do it alone.

159
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,971
And let's say there's 30 soldiers in that base.

160
00:07:46,888 --> 00:07:51,952
Essentially, that level, you would be having the player doing the killing that would normally

161
00:07:51,992 --> 00:07:54,414
be done by 90 soldiers in real life.

162
00:07:55,415 --> 00:07:59,499
In other words, you could say that that level would be 90 times more violent than a military

163
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:00,039
simulation.

164
00:08:01,721 --> 00:08:05,984
And this, of course, really makes sense if the only gameplay mechanics you have revolve

165
00:08:06,024 --> 00:08:11,529
around shooting, because you have no other tool in your toolkit to work with.

166
00:08:13,831 --> 00:08:15,712
So some games, like Arma, for example,

167
00:08:16,673 --> 00:08:19,575
make simple changes to their game mechanics

168
00:08:19,695 --> 00:08:22,297
that really change how combat behaves.

169
00:08:23,398 --> 00:08:25,900
So for example, bullets can kill you easily.

170
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,141
If you get shot in the face, you don't get to heal.

171
00:08:28,581 --> 00:08:31,423
These types of changes really make the player more cautious

172
00:08:31,704 --> 00:08:35,246
and much more hesitant to get involved in a firefight.

173
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:38,489
And by letting you have a bunch of friendly troops,

174
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:39,749
dozens of friendly troops,

175
00:08:41,152 --> 00:08:46,597
troops with you. It really lets it look more like a real-life military operation.

176
00:08:47,998 --> 00:08:51,741
The other thing is a lot of the combat in this game is about positioning yourself before

177
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:55,825
you get into a firefight. And so it really gives the player something to do other than

178
00:08:55,865 --> 00:08:56,946
just shooting a gun.

179
00:08:58,308 --> 00:08:59,909
But even in MILSIM games like Arma,

180
00:09:00,932 --> 00:09:03,975
The feature set tends to focus mainly on killing.

181
00:09:04,696 --> 00:09:05,857
And you might find it interesting,

182
00:09:06,037 --> 00:09:08,079
but in military simulations, we actually

183
00:09:08,099 --> 00:09:10,241
have a lot of features that you would never really

184
00:09:10,281 --> 00:09:12,963
expect to find in a first-person shooter.

185
00:09:14,004 --> 00:09:14,424
Excuse me.

186
00:09:18,268 --> 00:09:18,748
So for example.

187
00:09:19,663 --> 00:09:23,425
Here's a convoy training in Iraq.

188
00:09:24,045 --> 00:09:26,186
In early 2000s, the US Marine Corps

189
00:09:26,206 --> 00:09:27,987
was doing a lot of this using our software.

190
00:09:28,907 --> 00:09:31,748
And what you can see here is there

191
00:09:31,788 --> 00:09:34,089
was a feature that we left out when we made BBS2.

192
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:36,250
We forgot to include this feature from BBS1.

193
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,811
And it really was crucial for their training.

194
00:09:40,391 --> 00:09:42,512
So they wouldn't upgrade to the latest version

195
00:09:42,652 --> 00:09:44,013
until we put that feature back in.

196
00:09:45,113 --> 00:09:47,454
And of course, the feature I'm talking about is turn signals.

197
00:09:48,264 --> 00:09:51,988
This is a critical feature for military training, at least for convoy operations.

198
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:52,489
Why?

199
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:57,396
The reason is, in this case at least, the way the Marine Corps operated was when they

200
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:01,140
were on a convoy, before they made a turn, they would signal.

201
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:07,228
The lead vehicle would signal, the other vehicles would signal behind, and then that way everyone

202
00:10:07,268 --> 00:10:11,674
knew the turn was coming and everyone else knew that that had been acknowledged.

203
00:10:12,094 --> 00:10:16,159
So they were basically using this to train communication and teamwork, and that's why

204
00:10:16,219 --> 00:10:20,604
something that normally you would only see in like a truck simulator game was crucial

205
00:10:20,664 --> 00:10:21,746
for military simulations.

206
00:10:23,644 --> 00:10:24,404
Here's another example.

207
00:10:24,964 --> 00:10:27,005
This was for the New Zealand Defense Force.

208
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,526
So again, they wouldn't upgrade from VBS1 to VBS2

209
00:10:30,106 --> 00:10:34,147
because they were doing training for peacekeeping operations

210
00:10:34,187 --> 00:10:35,527
in East Timor at the time.

211
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:40,128
And so they were training their rules of engagement.

212
00:10:40,228 --> 00:10:41,929
And so of course, the most important feature

213
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:44,029
was the ability to put a weapon on your back.

214
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,291
uh... what they're training was

215
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:54,236
if there was a guerrilla fighter and he had a weapon on his back you kinda leave

216
00:10:54,256 --> 00:10:54,657
him alone

217
00:10:55,638 --> 00:10:57,860
if he had a weapon in his hand he could be shot

218
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,381
he might be threatening you

219
00:11:00,142 --> 00:11:01,143
so this is how something that

220
00:11:01,804 --> 00:11:06,288
would basically be an emote in an mmo becomes a critical feature in a real

221
00:11:06,328 --> 00:11:07,089
military simulator

222
00:11:09,445 --> 00:11:12,246
And the thing is, in VBS, we have thousands of features,

223
00:11:12,386 --> 00:11:13,746
and a lot of them are like this.

224
00:11:13,886 --> 00:11:15,807
They're not very violent, not very kinetic.

225
00:11:16,487 --> 00:11:18,168
A lot of them are very violent and very kinetic.

226
00:11:19,088 --> 00:11:21,669
But the point is, military has so many different tasks

227
00:11:21,729 --> 00:11:23,990
that they have to do in war, hundreds and hundreds of tasks,

228
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,570
and that's why we need all these features.

229
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,231
And a lot of them you would never really see

230
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:28,451
in a first-person shooter.

231
00:11:29,632 --> 00:11:30,972
But because war is so complex,

232
00:11:31,312 --> 00:11:32,733
there's so many different things they have to train.

233
00:11:33,913 --> 00:11:35,794
Another reason that makes war so complex

234
00:11:35,854 --> 00:11:37,034
is that it's hard to even define

235
00:11:37,094 --> 00:11:38,295
what exactly you're trying to win.

236
00:11:39,284 --> 00:11:40,625
which leads me into my next narrative.

237
00:11:41,305 --> 00:11:42,806
One war, many conflicts.

238
00:11:44,527 --> 00:11:46,989
So one of the reasons I wanted to go to Afghanistan

239
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,511
was to try to end the conflict there,

240
00:11:49,571 --> 00:11:51,252
bring peace to that country.

241
00:11:51,832 --> 00:11:55,574
And I was deployed as a civil affairs specialist,

242
00:11:55,654 --> 00:11:56,055
it's called.

243
00:11:56,555 --> 00:11:58,156
So I had a suitcase full of money,

244
00:11:58,216 --> 00:11:59,017
I had an interpreter,

245
00:11:59,057 --> 00:12:00,638
and I could go talk to village elders

246
00:12:00,698 --> 00:12:02,179
and talk to religious leaders,

247
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,640
hand out some money, try to win some hearts and minds.

248
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:09,068
And one of the things I quickly discovered

249
00:12:09,568 --> 00:12:12,089
was that we weren't in the middle of just one conflict,

250
00:12:12,109 --> 00:12:14,030
of like the Taliban versus the government.

251
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,011
There was actually a lot of different conflicts.

252
00:12:16,691 --> 00:12:21,473
So for example, the Afghan army was made up mostly

253
00:12:21,553 --> 00:12:27,075
of ethnicities from the north, Tajiks, Hazaras, Uzbeks.

254
00:12:28,773 --> 00:12:32,094
And we were in the Pashtun area in the south.

255
00:12:32,774 --> 00:12:36,015
So these different ethnic groups had all had centuries

256
00:12:36,075 --> 00:12:37,255
of conflict with each other.

257
00:12:38,796 --> 00:12:41,877
And they even spoke different languages.

258
00:12:42,557 --> 00:12:45,858
The Afghan army actually had to use our interpreters to talk

259
00:12:45,878 --> 00:12:47,098
to the local population.

260
00:12:48,158 --> 00:12:51,619
One of the soldiers actually told my interpreter that if we

261
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:54,300
just killed all the Tajiks, then we'd finally have peace.

262
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,121
And my interpreter was a Tajik.

263
00:12:56,381 --> 00:12:57,301
But this guy was serious.

264
00:13:00,568 --> 00:13:04,109
The Afghan police, they were Pashtun, actually,

265
00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:05,449
but they were from different districts.

266
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:08,550
They were a lot of fun to hang out with,

267
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,810
but they were really corrupt people.

268
00:13:12,011 --> 00:13:14,291
So they usually knew where the Taliban were,

269
00:13:14,351 --> 00:13:15,472
they knew where they were hiding

270
00:13:15,532 --> 00:13:16,452
and who was supporting them,

271
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:19,293
but they weren't really interested in doing much about it.

272
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:22,834
Instead, they focused on getting money out of the locals.

273
00:13:22,894 --> 00:13:24,834
They would throw people in jail, for example,

274
00:13:24,874 --> 00:13:27,155
and then demand a bribe in order to release them.

275
00:13:29,926 --> 00:13:32,087
And the thing is, in Pashtun society,

276
00:13:32,867 --> 00:13:34,547
you have this concept of Pashtun Wali,

277
00:13:34,927 --> 00:13:38,308
which is like this honor code that really drives the culture.

278
00:13:38,348 --> 00:13:41,449
And part of the honor code is revenge.

279
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:44,130
So if someone wrongs you, you've got to get revenge on them.

280
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:47,411
So you end up with a lot of these blood feuds going

281
00:13:47,471 --> 00:13:51,152
on between different people and different tribes in the area.

282
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:55,753
And really, they're trying to leverage us, the Marines

283
00:13:56,033 --> 00:13:57,093
or the Afghan government.

284
00:13:58,453 --> 00:14:02,896
or the police, they're trying to use us to further their feud.

285
00:14:03,396 --> 00:14:05,638
And we had to be very careful not to get wrapped up in that.

286
00:14:06,218 --> 00:14:08,740
And so, eventually I started understanding

287
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,161
that it's not just two conflicts,

288
00:14:11,301 --> 00:14:13,122
but it's actually a pyramid of conflicts.

289
00:14:13,162 --> 00:14:14,243
This is a good way to visualize it.

290
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,385
You have, at the top, you have just a few conflicts,

291
00:14:17,405 --> 00:14:18,105
which are global.

292
00:14:19,046 --> 00:14:20,407
But then you go down this pyramid,

293
00:14:20,447 --> 00:14:22,468
and you get more and more conflicts as you go down.

294
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:25,130
And these are conflicts with smaller and smaller groups,

295
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,171
but there's more and more of them.

296
00:14:27,251 --> 00:14:27,351
So.

297
00:14:30,386 --> 00:14:36,511
For example, it starts with the, you know, Al-Qaeda and the US and it gets down to these

298
00:14:36,571 --> 00:14:37,652
blood feuds I'm talking about.

299
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:43,736
And really, if it sounds familiar, with all this intrigue and alliances that form and

300
00:14:43,756 --> 00:14:49,340
then they break and they shift and they backstab each other, it sounds a lot like Game of Thrones

301
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,081
and that's really the best way to describe it.

302
00:14:52,405 --> 00:14:55,786
So if you want a good dramatic example of it, look at Game of Thrones.

303
00:14:56,426 --> 00:14:58,847
And it's really complex in this book.

304
00:14:58,887 --> 00:15:03,849
You might know it's actually based off a real war from English medieval history.

305
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:05,850
At least that's how part of the inspiration.

306
00:15:09,063 --> 00:15:11,344
It's really complex, but audiences really love this.

307
00:15:11,784 --> 00:15:12,084
Why?

308
00:15:12,364 --> 00:15:12,924
Why is that?

309
00:15:13,504 --> 00:15:15,565
So I would argue that they love it

310
00:15:15,605 --> 00:15:18,546
because it's this narrative loop of discovery and surprise.

311
00:15:18,946 --> 00:15:20,246
So you enter the world.

312
00:15:20,506 --> 00:15:21,046
You're naive.

313
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:22,287
You're not quite sure what's going on.

314
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:25,207
You start to learn the game that's being played around you.

315
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,608
You start to learn who are the players, and who's who,

316
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:29,928
and what are the rules.

317
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,171
And just when you think you have it figured out,

318
00:15:32,611 --> 00:15:35,592
something surprises you, and you've got to learn everything all over again.

319
00:15:36,252 --> 00:15:39,213
So, this is a great narrative for TV and books,

320
00:15:39,293 --> 00:15:40,574
but does this work in video games?

321
00:15:41,534 --> 00:15:45,436
I would say there's a good example in Crusader Kings 2, for example.

322
00:15:45,836 --> 00:15:48,497
This is a game that's basically a medieval politics simulator.

323
00:15:49,097 --> 00:15:50,477
And there's thousands of nobles,

324
00:15:50,738 --> 00:15:52,558
and they're all vying for power against each other,

325
00:15:52,878 --> 00:15:56,059
and they're breaking alliances and forming alliances and having intrigues.

326
00:15:57,036 --> 00:15:59,882
And it's a very powerful, engaging gameplay loop.

327
00:15:59,942 --> 00:16:02,067
And six years later, this game is still popular.

328
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:04,994
A more recent example might be The Witcher 3.

329
00:16:06,587 --> 00:16:10,569
So in this game, they have a pyramid of conflict,

330
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:11,750
similar to what I described earlier,

331
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,891
which is kind of the backdrop of the world.

332
00:16:14,271 --> 00:16:15,111
At the very high level,

333
00:16:15,151 --> 00:16:17,573
you have Nilfgaard versus the Northern Kingdoms,

334
00:16:17,993 --> 00:16:20,134
and then you have these lower level conflicts,

335
00:16:20,274 --> 00:16:23,015
like the different clans in the Skellige Islands

336
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:24,396
that are fighting each other

337
00:16:24,476 --> 00:16:26,117
and debating whether to join the bigger war,

338
00:16:26,457 --> 00:16:27,718
and then you have personal conflicts.

339
00:16:28,218 --> 00:16:34,706
a really interesting complex backdrop that the writers can use to make all sorts of plots,

340
00:16:34,826 --> 00:16:38,771
all sorts of quests, and they can all tie into each other if they want to.

341
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:43,377
And these are just examples of what you can do if you have a little bit less killing in

342
00:16:43,397 --> 00:16:43,838
your games.

343
00:16:44,138 --> 00:16:46,241
You open up space for things like this.

344
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:52,532
And this complexity is something that a lot of audiences really enjoy and find really

345
00:16:53,072 --> 00:16:55,213
engaging, which brings me to my next narrative.

346
00:16:55,874 --> 00:16:57,935
Narrative number three, moral complexity.

347
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:02,581
So first of all, let me define what I do not mean

348
00:17:02,661 --> 00:17:03,561
by moral complexity.

349
00:17:04,062 --> 00:17:06,223
Moral complexity is not moral simplicity.

350
00:17:06,784 --> 00:17:09,406
It might sound obvious, but we get them mixed up a lot.

351
00:17:10,046 --> 00:17:12,868
So for example, if it's clear, all your choices,

352
00:17:13,048 --> 00:17:15,710
what your choices are, and if it's clear which choice

353
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,351
is right and which choice is wrong,

354
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:20,533
then you're actually faced with simplicity, not complexity.

355
00:17:21,134 --> 00:17:23,335
Just because you're given a choice doesn't make it complex.

356
00:17:24,636 --> 00:17:26,838
Moral ambiguity is also

357
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,101
not what I'm talking about here. So moral ambiguity

358
00:17:31,601 --> 00:17:33,001
is where there is no right, there is no

359
00:17:33,061 --> 00:17:35,802
wrong. Everything's just kind of gray. But that's not,

360
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:38,403
that's not really how, how war is. If you're

361
00:17:38,423 --> 00:17:40,104
a soldier in a war, your job is to

362
00:17:40,804 --> 00:17:43,485
do the right thing. But complexity means it's, it's

363
00:17:43,565 --> 00:17:45,505
hard to figure out what the right thing is.

364
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:47,286
You have to do a lot of work

365
00:17:48,306 --> 00:17:50,187
to figure it out. And you don't have a

366
00:17:50,227 --> 00:17:51,907
lot of time to figure it out sometimes. And

367
00:17:51,967 --> 00:17:52,828
lives are on the line.

368
00:17:55,349 --> 00:17:56,969
So let me give you an example.

369
00:17:59,697 --> 00:18:02,778
So one day, one of our bases got attacked by a rocket.

370
00:18:03,118 --> 00:18:04,959
A Marine got thrown out of the guard tower.

371
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:07,940
Luckily, he was completely uninjured.

372
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,181
About a week later, we were on patrol near that base, and we

373
00:18:12,201 --> 00:18:15,682
just randomly ran into two civilians on a motorcycle.

374
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:17,923
And hanging off the side of the motorcycle were bags of

375
00:18:18,023 --> 00:18:21,604
rockets, so the point man on the patrol immediately threw

376
00:18:21,664 --> 00:18:26,606
up and said, pointed at the motorcycle and said, put up

377
00:18:26,626 --> 00:18:26,926
your hands.

378
00:18:28,189 --> 00:18:29,590
So the guy here that you can see,

379
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,551
he threw up his hands and he surrendered.

380
00:18:31,912 --> 00:18:33,413
The other guy on the motorcycle ran away.

381
00:18:33,893 --> 00:18:35,815
The point man shot at him as he ran away.

382
00:18:37,136 --> 00:18:39,398
He got hit, but he ended up escaping,

383
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:41,480
and we found out later he bled to death.

384
00:18:42,381 --> 00:18:44,703
So the question is, how do we know

385
00:18:44,763 --> 00:18:47,065
if this is the right thing to do in that situation?

386
00:18:48,366 --> 00:18:50,948
And in fact, we actually have a legal code

387
00:18:51,469 --> 00:18:53,650
called the Law of Land Warfare that helps us here.

388
00:18:54,796 --> 00:18:58,137
And one thing you'll notice about this guy is he's not wearing a uniform.

389
00:18:58,217 --> 00:18:59,657
He looks like a civilian.

390
00:18:59,717 --> 00:19:02,238
He's trying to blend in with the civilian population.

391
00:19:03,218 --> 00:19:05,558
That makes him what's called an unlawful combatant.

392
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:09,579
So he and his buddies were unlawful combatant,

393
00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:11,500
and it's legal to fight them until they surrender.

394
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,041
But how do you know who's a combatant and who's a civilian

395
00:19:16,061 --> 00:19:16,881
when they all look the same?

396
00:19:18,011 --> 00:19:21,333
So the law actually, again, gives us a guide on this.

397
00:19:21,974 --> 00:19:24,895
If somebody is engaging in a hostile act against you,

398
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:28,498
or if they're demonstrating intent to engage in such an act,

399
00:19:28,898 --> 00:19:30,579
then you have an inherent right to self-defense,

400
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:31,180
and you can fight.

401
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,082
So it sounds pretty simple, but it actually

402
00:19:35,102 --> 00:19:36,983
gets really complicated in practice.

403
00:19:38,404 --> 00:19:40,946
Here's an example of insurgent tactic in Iraq.

404
00:19:42,227 --> 00:19:45,409
So in this case, you've got a freeway overpass.

405
00:19:46,777 --> 00:19:47,958
Mm-hmm, yes.

406
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:51,521
You've got an overpass, and you've got two insurgents

407
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:52,101
standing on it.

408
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:54,923
And they're not carrying any rifles, any weapons visibly.

409
00:19:56,285 --> 00:19:57,365
And one guy is the observer.

410
00:19:57,606 --> 00:19:58,606
He's watching for the convoy.

411
00:19:59,007 --> 00:20:01,508
The guy behind him is holding a homemade bomb.

412
00:20:02,049 --> 00:20:04,791
And when the observer sees the convoy go under the overpass,

413
00:20:04,831 --> 00:20:06,612
he signals to the guy with the bomb who's

414
00:20:06,632 --> 00:20:09,995
going to drop it down on top of the vehicles inside that hole

415
00:20:10,155 --> 00:20:11,776
and to blow up the crew inside.

416
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:15,979
And then they run away, usually.

417
00:20:17,493 --> 00:20:20,475
So imagine you're on a convoy and you see this happen to the vehicle in front of you.

418
00:20:21,575 --> 00:20:26,799
And let's say a few of your friends get killed and then let's say a week later you're on

419
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:31,022
a convoy again and you're driving down that same road and you're coming up on the same

420
00:20:31,082 --> 00:20:33,363
overpass and you see somebody watching you.

421
00:20:34,124 --> 00:20:37,266
And you're pretty sure that's the same guy you saw last week.

422
00:20:38,127 --> 00:20:39,588
So what do you do?

423
00:20:39,808 --> 00:20:42,029
Are you witnessing hostile intent here?

424
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,191
Should you defend yourself right now?

425
00:20:46,237 --> 00:20:47,157
Maybe you shoot that guy.

426
00:20:47,657 --> 00:20:48,978
Maybe you're trying to protect your friends.

427
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,580
And maybe afterwards you go search his body

428
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,681
and you find a bomb on it.

429
00:20:52,801 --> 00:20:55,142
And so maybe you were right, you protected them.

430
00:20:56,123 --> 00:20:57,964
But maybe you search him and you don't find anything

431
00:20:57,984 --> 00:20:59,685
and he was just some innocent civilian

432
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,986
that was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

433
00:21:03,447 --> 00:21:05,669
Or maybe you don't do anything because you can't be sure.

434
00:21:06,209 --> 00:21:08,731
And then maybe the vehicle in front of you gets blown up

435
00:21:09,071 --> 00:21:09,831
and your friends die.

436
00:21:11,617 --> 00:21:14,398
Or maybe there's some other choice that you're not seeing.

437
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:16,759
Maybe you can tell the convoy to stop,

438
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:19,580
and maybe we can send a team up there to search those guys.

439
00:21:23,801 --> 00:21:27,203
The point is, in modern warfare, in 21st century warfare,

440
00:21:27,243 --> 00:21:28,843
there's all sorts of events like this,

441
00:21:28,883 --> 00:21:31,124
where you have just a very little amount of time

442
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,905
to decide what to do and how to act.

443
00:21:35,226 --> 00:21:35,866
Military spends...

444
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:42,082
A lot of time and effort trying to train soldiers for these situations so that they'll know

445
00:21:42,122 --> 00:21:43,422
what to do when they're in them.

446
00:21:44,782 --> 00:21:49,203
But you know, this is all very interesting, but is there any way to put this into a video

447
00:21:49,223 --> 00:21:50,844
game and would it be interesting in a video game?

448
00:21:53,144 --> 00:21:57,165
And I would argue that the Telltale Games series do a great job of this all the time.

449
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,742
So in these games, you're given a very small amount of time

450
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,263
to make very big decisions.

451
00:22:03,043 --> 00:22:04,564
And your decisions have consequences,

452
00:22:04,724 --> 00:22:06,946
and it's not always clear what's right and what's wrong.

453
00:22:08,247 --> 00:22:11,169
And these are very engaging games,

454
00:22:11,729 --> 00:22:15,492
and they're very, very complex decisions that you have to make.

455
00:22:16,112 --> 00:22:18,234
You could basically use the same techniques here,

456
00:22:18,394 --> 00:22:20,735
the same narrative techniques, the same gameplay techniques.

457
00:22:21,688 --> 00:22:26,772
put this in, uh, set this in the Iraq or Afghan war and you'd have one of the most realistic

458
00:22:26,872 --> 00:22:34,399
and, and immersive war games ever made. Another good example comes from Spec Ops The Line.

459
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:41,285
In this scene, uh, you come across your squad mate Lugo who was just killed by an angry

460
00:22:41,325 --> 00:22:41,605
mob.

461
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:45,521
and then they're now surrounding you,

462
00:22:45,802 --> 00:22:47,543
and they're screaming, and they're yelling,

463
00:22:47,563 --> 00:22:48,484
and they're angry at you.

464
00:22:49,305 --> 00:22:52,267
And your other squad mate, who's still alive,

465
00:22:52,347 --> 00:22:54,089
he's getting nervous.

466
00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:56,351
He's afraid that you're gonna get killed as well

467
00:22:56,391 --> 00:22:57,452
by this crowd.

468
00:22:57,952 --> 00:23:00,214
And he's asking for permission to shoot the crowd.

469
00:23:01,535 --> 00:23:03,377
And you have to make a decision.

470
00:23:04,871 --> 00:23:07,792
And it's really interesting because actually in VBS,

471
00:23:07,952 --> 00:23:10,633
we have a lot of features that are designed to train soldiers

472
00:23:10,713 --> 00:23:12,014
for situations like this.

473
00:23:12,674 --> 00:23:14,975
So the technique you're supposed to use here

474
00:23:15,015 --> 00:23:16,696
is actually called escalation of force.

475
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:18,816
And the proper way to handle this,

476
00:23:18,936 --> 00:23:21,337
both professionally and morally, is

477
00:23:21,457 --> 00:23:24,098
you start with the lowest level of force

478
00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:26,479
that will diffuse the situation and that'll

479
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:27,800
keep you and your friends safe.

480
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,521
So that might start with strong language.

481
00:23:31,101 --> 00:23:33,182
It might escalate to like warning shots.

482
00:23:34,022 --> 00:23:36,943
uh... and but if necessary then you go to lethal force

483
00:23:37,424 --> 00:23:39,524
but only if necessary if nothing else will work

484
00:23:40,505 --> 00:23:41,185
but interestingly

485
00:23:41,205 --> 00:23:44,146
uh... a lot of players when they're faced with this situation

486
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:47,847
the game will actually let you fire warning shot and it will diffuse the

487
00:23:47,867 --> 00:23:49,508
situation the civilians will run away

488
00:23:50,548 --> 00:23:52,049
most players don't even try doing that at all

489
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:55,141
They're faced with all this pressure.

490
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:57,282
They've got their buddy yelling at them

491
00:23:57,422 --> 00:23:58,602
to shoot at the crowd.

492
00:23:58,662 --> 00:24:00,083
Their other buddy just got killed.

493
00:24:00,883 --> 00:24:03,764
They're nervous and they're angry

494
00:24:04,004 --> 00:24:05,524
and they just shoot the civilians.

495
00:24:05,684 --> 00:24:09,285
And the civilians run away and the soldiers

496
00:24:09,325 --> 00:24:10,185
make it out alive.

497
00:24:10,685 --> 00:24:13,206
But there's women and children that are just lying dead.

498
00:24:14,506 --> 00:24:16,307
And so that's sort of some of the complexity

499
00:24:17,107 --> 00:24:17,887
that can be faced.

500
00:24:18,247 --> 00:24:20,048
And that brings me to my last narrative.

501
00:24:21,187 --> 00:24:23,909
Narrative number four, the civilians pay the highest price.

502
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:27,052
So this is a pretty taboo subject, really,

503
00:24:27,152 --> 00:24:30,094
to touch or to talk about in a video game,

504
00:24:30,254 --> 00:24:33,096
especially even in regular conversation.

505
00:24:33,136 --> 00:24:34,657
It's something we don't really want to talk about.

506
00:24:36,078 --> 00:24:38,680
So I wouldn't blame anyone if you wanted to avoid this topic.

507
00:24:39,461 --> 00:24:41,522
But let me give you an example of what this looked like,

508
00:24:42,003 --> 00:24:42,803
in saying it, at least.

509
00:24:44,447 --> 00:24:47,489
Here's a picture of an IED in the ground.

510
00:24:48,169 --> 00:24:51,691
And what you'll see is you'll see a series of stones.

511
00:24:51,871 --> 00:24:53,672
This was placed there by the Taliban

512
00:24:54,152 --> 00:24:56,773
in order to warn the civilians that there's an IED there

513
00:24:56,853 --> 00:24:57,533
to stay away.

514
00:24:58,054 --> 00:25:00,115
So the civilians, the Taliban rather,

515
00:25:00,495 --> 00:25:02,776
they're trying to win hearts and minds just like we are.

516
00:25:03,096 --> 00:25:04,797
So they don't want collateral damage of civilians.

517
00:25:04,817 --> 00:25:06,017
They want to avoid it if they can.

518
00:25:07,598 --> 00:25:08,759
So when we first got to Sangin,

519
00:25:09,859 --> 00:25:11,200
the civilians knew where the IEDs were,

520
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,340
but they didn't really want to tell us.

521
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,301
They didn't really trust us.

522
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:16,978
After we'd been there for a while,

523
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:19,061
we must have been doing something right.

524
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:20,682
They started trusting us more, I guess,

525
00:25:20,722 --> 00:25:21,583
and they started coming to us

526
00:25:21,643 --> 00:25:23,145
and telling us where these IEDs were.

527
00:25:24,326 --> 00:25:27,370
And we would send our EOD teams out there to disarm them.

528
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:31,654
So the Taliban didn't really like that,

529
00:25:31,694 --> 00:25:34,137
so they stopped telling the civilians where the IEDs were.

530
00:25:34,217 --> 00:25:35,979
And then it ends up looking like this.

531
00:25:38,984 --> 00:25:42,445
In case you can't tell, the IED is buried right there.

532
00:25:43,365 --> 00:25:45,266
Now, obviously, these are very hard to spot,

533
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:48,067
and they're also very deadly if you step on them.

534
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:51,588
So, I have a question for you.

535
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:56,869
Do you think those two kids would be any better

536
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,350
at spotting those IEDs than you would be?

537
00:26:01,813 --> 00:26:03,234
So let me tell you another story.

538
00:26:03,794 --> 00:26:05,015
So one day we were at the base.

539
00:26:06,116 --> 00:26:06,837
We heard an explosion.

540
00:26:08,098 --> 00:26:09,759
We checked on the radio.

541
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:12,181
None of our patrols that were out got hit by anything.

542
00:26:13,122 --> 00:26:17,065
And we found out about a week later that a young boy stepped

543
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:18,566
on an IED and got blown up.

544
00:26:19,047 --> 00:26:21,469
It's not the kids pictured here, but it's actually very

545
00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:22,609
similar, they were similar in age.

546
00:26:25,201 --> 00:26:30,063
About a week later, we had a patrol that was out near the same house where that one boy

547
00:26:30,103 --> 00:26:30,643
got blown up.

548
00:26:31,564 --> 00:26:35,446
And they heard an explosion and they saw smoke.

549
00:26:36,446 --> 00:26:37,446
And they rushed over to help.

550
00:26:38,427 --> 00:26:43,489
And what they saw was another boy, similar age, again, not pictured here.

551
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:49,252
And he was laying there with his legs blown off in a pool of his blood, bleeding to death.

552
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,870
And his parents were nearby, and they were watching this,

553
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:53,750
and they were screaming.

554
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,831
They were watching their kid die in front of them.

555
00:26:56,571 --> 00:26:57,992
And it was actually the same parents

556
00:26:58,052 --> 00:27:00,513
that lost their other son a week earlier.

557
00:27:02,614 --> 00:27:05,415
So the squad leader that was with that patrol

558
00:27:05,475 --> 00:27:07,756
and his interpreter ran over and started

559
00:27:07,776 --> 00:27:11,398
putting tourniquets on the stumps of the kid's leg.

560
00:27:12,318 --> 00:27:14,319
But yeah, he bled out.

561
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:14,740
He died.

562
00:27:17,081 --> 00:27:18,981
And the thing is that.

563
00:27:20,828 --> 00:27:23,330
Those IEDs that those kids stepped on,

564
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:26,392
those weren't meant for those kids.

565
00:27:27,073 --> 00:27:29,835
Those were meant to kill us, to kill the Marines.

566
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:33,437
And they were there because we were there.

567
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:36,320
We were fighting in this kid's backyard,

568
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,922
and so there were bombs there.

569
00:27:39,562 --> 00:27:40,703
If we wouldn't have been there,

570
00:27:40,763 --> 00:27:41,964
those bombs wouldn't have been there,

571
00:27:42,384 --> 00:27:45,186
and this kid would have been okay.

572
00:27:46,767 --> 00:27:46,848
So.

573
00:27:48,112 --> 00:27:49,654
This is a pretty dark topic, obviously.

574
00:27:50,755 --> 00:27:53,518
And the question is, can games touch on this?

575
00:27:53,698 --> 00:27:54,880
And there's a few good examples of it.

576
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,762
One example is a game called This War of Mine.

577
00:27:57,183 --> 00:27:58,925
It's actually a game set in a war,

578
00:27:58,985 --> 00:28:00,647
but you don't play as soldiers.

579
00:28:00,687 --> 00:28:01,528
You play as civilians.

580
00:28:01,568 --> 00:28:03,470
And your job is to try to stay alive in the war.

581
00:28:04,862 --> 00:28:08,783
It's very dark, but it sold 2.5 million copies,

582
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:11,224
and it's received widespread critical acclaim.

583
00:28:11,964 --> 00:28:14,004
Very well received, 10 out of 10 on Steam.

584
00:28:14,725 --> 00:28:16,765
Another example is from Bohemia Interactive.

585
00:28:17,145 --> 00:28:18,386
I don't work on ARMA, by the way,

586
00:28:19,306 --> 00:28:20,846
but I was really interested in this DLC.

587
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:23,647
It's called The Laws of War, and in it you play as a

588
00:28:26,377 --> 00:28:31,019
aid worker basically, a humanitarian aid worker, which sounds super boring for a game about

589
00:28:31,219 --> 00:28:31,839
shooting people.

590
00:28:32,619 --> 00:28:36,981
And one reviewer called it a walking simulator because you spend most of the game walking

591
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:38,502
around disarming landmines.

592
00:28:38,942 --> 00:28:40,883
But that same reviewer was like, it was great.

593
00:28:40,923 --> 00:28:45,265
It was one of the most emotionally impactful experiences I've ever had in a first-person

594
00:28:45,285 --> 00:28:45,585
shooter.

595
00:28:45,865 --> 00:28:47,866
And there's a lot of other reviewers that say similar things.

596
00:28:49,067 --> 00:28:50,589
It's rated 9 out of 10 on Steam.

597
00:28:51,109 --> 00:28:56,315
So there is maybe some space for even uncomfortable topics

598
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:58,798
like this, and even in a game about war.

599
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:05,845
So to review, war, what else is there?

600
00:29:05,885 --> 00:29:06,806
What else can we write about?

601
00:29:08,926 --> 00:29:10,667
My first narrative was less killing, more war.

602
00:29:11,568 --> 00:29:14,830
Remember war, there's hundreds of tasks, not just shooting.

603
00:29:15,551 --> 00:29:16,471
Combat should be dangerous,

604
00:29:16,912 --> 00:29:19,854
and if you change your mechanics, it can be, not a cartoon.

605
00:29:20,254 --> 00:29:22,396
And if you give the player less killing to do,

606
00:29:22,456 --> 00:29:24,457
you have more space for other experiences.

607
00:29:25,178 --> 00:29:27,219
Some of them can be violent, some of them can be less violent.

608
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:29,321
Some of them can go from non-violent to violent

609
00:29:29,361 --> 00:29:31,082
in the moment, in a very short amount of time.

610
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,821
Next narrative, one war, many conflicts.

611
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:37,063
Remember, there's sort of a pyramid of different conflicts,

612
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:40,085
global, local, all the way down to personal.

613
00:29:40,185 --> 00:29:42,186
And this can lead you to a narrative loop

614
00:29:42,226 --> 00:29:44,127
of discovery, surprise, and rediscovery

615
00:29:44,227 --> 00:29:46,489
as you start to unravel all these conflicts

616
00:29:47,149 --> 00:29:48,370
and as you work your way through it.

617
00:29:49,271 --> 00:29:50,732
And again, a great example is Game of Thrones.

618
00:29:52,013 --> 00:29:53,394
Number three, moral complexity.

619
00:29:55,215 --> 00:29:56,516
Again, there's a difference between this

620
00:29:56,556 --> 00:29:58,057
and moral simplicity and ambiguity.

621
00:29:58,097 --> 00:29:59,118
This means you have to work hard

622
00:29:59,158 --> 00:30:00,278
to figure out the right thing to do,

623
00:30:00,378 --> 00:30:01,859
but you're trying to do the right thing.

624
00:30:02,923 --> 00:30:04,885
The problem is, in modern warfare,

625
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:07,608
you're forced into a lot of these complex situations,

626
00:30:07,668 --> 00:30:09,450
and you don't necessarily have a lot of time

627
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,691
to figure out what's right.

628
00:30:11,272 --> 00:30:12,914
So a great way to implement this in games

629
00:30:12,934 --> 00:30:14,596
would be things like time-limited decisions,

630
00:30:14,676 --> 00:30:15,937
branching narratives, et cetera.

631
00:30:16,902 --> 00:30:19,824
And finally, number four, civilians pay the highest price.

632
00:30:20,365 --> 00:30:21,866
Both sides in the conflict are always

633
00:30:21,906 --> 00:30:23,087
gonna cause collateral damage.

634
00:30:23,207 --> 00:30:24,368
There's no way it can be avoided

635
00:30:24,408 --> 00:30:25,289
no matter how hard you try.

636
00:30:25,309 --> 00:30:27,891
This is a very dark and risky subject, really,

637
00:30:27,931 --> 00:30:30,914
to touch on in a game, but if you try

638
00:30:30,934 --> 00:30:32,475
and if you do it successfully, this can lead

639
00:30:32,495 --> 00:30:34,757
to some powerful, memorable experiences.

640
00:30:35,738 --> 00:30:38,060
And I really just wanna kinda close on that note.

641
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,261
I wanna remind you that stories

642
00:30:40,382 --> 00:30:42,023
are very, very powerful things.

643
00:30:43,192 --> 00:30:46,015
And writing itself is not easy.

644
00:30:46,555 --> 00:30:49,759
Writing, like doing good writing is very hard.

645
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,602
For me, this speech was very hard to write

646
00:30:52,622 --> 00:30:53,363
and it's not even good.

647
00:30:53,383 --> 00:30:57,267
That means if you're a writer and you're a good writer

648
00:30:57,287 --> 00:30:58,648
and you're an effective writer,

649
00:30:59,189 --> 00:31:00,730
then you're a very powerful person.

650
00:31:01,331 --> 00:31:04,074
You can tell stories that are very powerful.

651
00:31:07,034 --> 00:31:09,659
So you have powerful things in your hands,

652
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:11,342
and I would just ask you to please

653
00:31:11,963 --> 00:31:13,205
use those things responsibly.

654
00:31:14,808 --> 00:31:15,309
Thank you very much.
