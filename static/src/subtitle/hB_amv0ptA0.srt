1
00:00:05,995 --> 00:00:06,935
I think we have to start.

2
00:00:08,256 --> 00:00:10,437
And welcome and good morning everyone.

3
00:00:13,459 --> 00:00:17,221
My name is Philip Ericsson and I work as a sound designer

4
00:00:17,261 --> 00:00:21,183
at EA DICE in Stockholm where I've been for like four years

5
00:00:21,423 --> 00:00:24,564
worked on both Battlefront titles and Battlefield.

6
00:00:26,506 --> 00:00:30,308
And during this talk, I will talk about the heroes,

7
00:00:30,608 --> 00:00:32,889
sounds for the heroes of Star Wars Battlefront 2.

8
00:00:36,824 --> 00:00:39,025
And these are the topics that I will cover

9
00:00:39,045 --> 00:00:40,105
during this presentation.

10
00:00:41,885 --> 00:00:44,106
I will talk about the sound design direction that we had

11
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:44,786
for this game.

12
00:00:46,687 --> 00:00:50,788
And I will go through some challenges that we had during

13
00:00:50,828 --> 00:00:51,568
this production.

14
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:56,669
I will show a lot of examples, both video and sound.

15
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,771
And I will go into detail, showing you the systems that I

16
00:01:02,811 --> 00:01:05,172
made to create these sounds and play them in the game.

17
00:01:07,707 --> 00:01:13,310
But first, let's look at some real gameplay video stuff

18
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,252
that contains a lot of different abilities, heroes, and action.

19
00:01:17,852 --> 00:01:18,092
Enjoy.

20
00:01:42,523 --> 00:01:42,644
Oh

21
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:22,750
How many heads did you miss?

22
00:03:02,296 --> 00:03:05,517
So, the sound design direction that we had for this game was...

23
00:03:06,813 --> 00:03:10,216
We wanted to try to get as far away from the game sounding

24
00:03:10,296 --> 00:03:13,718
gamey and let it sound more real, believable, immersive,

25
00:03:14,238 --> 00:03:16,299
and really put you in a galaxy far, far away.

26
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,082
It was, of course, the most important thing

27
00:03:21,162 --> 00:03:22,983
to stay true to the Star Wars universe

28
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,705
and make the game sound like the movies.

29
00:03:29,107 --> 00:03:32,909
We wanted to support the stories and create feelings

30
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:35,971
and enhance the characteristics of the heroes and the villains.

31
00:03:38,413 --> 00:03:44,177
And it was very important for us that it sounded like the sounds were actually created in the world,

32
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:49,541
interacting with the materials, the different environments and the characters,

33
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:53,323
like the newer Star Wars movies, for example Rogue One.

34
00:03:54,144 --> 00:03:58,707
And this made the soundscape feel a bit more realistic and a bit grittier,

35
00:03:59,648 --> 00:04:04,931
although we at the same time strived to make a very clean and dynamic mix and readable for the player.

36
00:04:08,877 --> 00:04:10,257
Some challenges that we had,

37
00:04:11,097 --> 00:04:13,398
one of the big ones was mixed eras.

38
00:04:13,618 --> 00:04:17,560
We didn't only have the original trilogy,

39
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,820
the prequel trilogy, and the sequel trilogy.

40
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,961
We also had stuff from the cartoons,

41
00:04:22,501 --> 00:04:24,802
and you could say that we also created a new era

42
00:04:24,862 --> 00:04:27,663
with the single player story with Iden.

43
00:04:29,504 --> 00:04:31,964
And we wanted these to sound different from each other

44
00:04:32,225 --> 00:04:34,825
and make their individual contrasts stand out

45
00:04:35,106 --> 00:04:36,166
while still treating them

46
00:04:36,953 --> 00:04:39,334
with the same philosophy to make them fit

47
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:40,774
into the shared soundscape.

48
00:04:44,195 --> 00:04:46,496
In order to handle all the abilities

49
00:04:46,576 --> 00:04:47,956
and the scope for this project,

50
00:04:48,336 --> 00:04:50,237
we needed to create smart solutions

51
00:04:50,597 --> 00:04:52,197
that would help us deliver fast,

52
00:04:52,277 --> 00:04:53,877
but still maintain high quality.

53
00:04:55,158 --> 00:04:57,158
So we created some versatile systems

54
00:04:57,198 --> 00:05:01,039
that could handle many different types of ability sounds.

55
00:05:02,059 --> 00:05:04,621
And these sounds, they shared strategies.

56
00:05:05,502 --> 00:05:09,545
And this system made it a lot easier to iterate.

57
00:05:09,925 --> 00:05:13,788
And you could do both general changes to all abilities,

58
00:05:13,868 --> 00:05:15,870
as well as individual tweaks per sound.

59
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:19,332
And this really helped both the design process

60
00:05:19,993 --> 00:05:22,375
and maintaining the sound throughout the project

61
00:05:22,895 --> 00:05:23,816
and the mixing stage.

62
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:30,921
We also wanted to focus a great deal on the gameplay feedback.

63
00:05:32,006 --> 00:05:37,150
We created a mix that was less compressed and clean and a lot

64
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,112
more readable, with clear distance feedback

65
00:05:40,172 --> 00:05:43,455
and directionality and other important gameplay indications.

66
00:05:45,196 --> 00:05:47,858
So as I said, the mix was less compressed,

67
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:50,560
and it left more space for each sound.

68
00:05:50,961 --> 00:05:52,842
And it was easier to give the power

69
00:05:52,882 --> 00:05:54,123
to a sound where it was needed.

70
00:05:55,592 --> 00:05:58,573
We also made distant content for all the abilities.

71
00:05:59,433 --> 00:06:02,374
And they are affected by the environment where they are

72
00:06:02,414 --> 00:06:04,535
created as well, where the sounds are created.

73
00:06:06,195 --> 00:06:11,017
And we also do a thing where the enemy sounds are higher in

74
00:06:11,057 --> 00:06:13,958
priority and louder than your friendliest sounds.

75
00:06:17,016 --> 00:06:21,038
We also really tried to focus on making different

76
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,661
perspectives, so for example, when you are being affected

77
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:27,983
by an ability, that was something that was important,

78
00:06:28,204 --> 00:06:31,446
and also dealing and taking damage so that you got

79
00:06:31,566 --> 00:06:32,306
feedback from that.

80
00:06:34,148 --> 00:06:36,810
We also in the sound design wanted to create clear

81
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,872
characteristics between the heroes and the villains

82
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:43,394
as well as an individual character's own sound signature

83
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,436
so that you could easily spot enemies.

84
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,571
One thing that is very hard when working with Star Wars

85
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:54,733
is the lack of variation and also the gameplay abilities

86
00:06:54,813 --> 00:06:56,913
being different from the reference in the movies.

87
00:06:58,414 --> 00:07:01,936
And we always try to take the reference from the movies

88
00:07:02,016 --> 00:07:05,257
and try to expand, find elements, and recreate sounds

89
00:07:05,917 --> 00:07:08,618
and a variation in perspective, but still

90
00:07:08,758 --> 00:07:10,999
keep the character of the reference sound,

91
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:13,220
but just making it fit gameplay, basically.

92
00:07:15,443 --> 00:07:18,766
Sometimes there was no reference or very vague reference in the films,

93
00:07:19,346 --> 00:07:23,389
but we needed to use the same recipes to make them fit into the Star Wars universe.

94
00:07:26,431 --> 00:07:29,154
Lucasfilm, they also wanted to approve some of our sounds,

95
00:07:29,754 --> 00:07:35,358
and something that was very important to them was that the Force sounds didn't sound too magical,

96
00:07:35,859 --> 00:07:38,701
too techy, or too similar to Marvel.

97
00:07:40,367 --> 00:07:46,794
And we tried to use the same principles as Ben Burtt, Matt Wood and David Accord to get the same feeling.

98
00:07:47,876 --> 00:07:53,823
And the direction from Lucasfilm was often less is more, or the more believable it was, the better they thought it was.

99
00:07:56,311 --> 00:07:58,852
In the game as well, sometimes the abilities

100
00:07:58,892 --> 00:08:00,593
have very little visual feedback.

101
00:08:00,953 --> 00:08:05,295
So a visual representation of an ability

102
00:08:05,335 --> 00:08:07,696
could just be an animation with a hand being lifted up

103
00:08:07,756 --> 00:08:10,817
in the air, like Darth Vader's force choke, for example.

104
00:08:11,337 --> 00:08:13,738
But the sound still needed to provide

105
00:08:13,758 --> 00:08:15,759
the diffuse but yet expected sound.

106
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,201
So let's move on to the examples.

107
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,882
And I will give three examples.

108
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:28,986
I will start with Kylo Ren and his ability Force Freeze.

109
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:32,747
And for this example, I used almost exclusively

110
00:08:33,107 --> 00:08:34,668
the sound effects from the movie stems,

111
00:08:35,088 --> 00:08:36,348
and he's from the sequel trilogy.

112
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:41,090
Next up is Darth Maul from the prequel trilogy

113
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,791
and his ability Force Push, which had a clear reference,

114
00:08:44,911 --> 00:08:47,191
but I needed to make a hybrid with new sounds.

115
00:08:48,551 --> 00:08:52,993
And last but not least, Luke Skywalker and Force Repulse.

116
00:08:54,307 --> 00:08:56,048
And this had never been shown in any movie,

117
00:08:56,108 --> 00:08:58,169
so I had to come up with a completely new sound,

118
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,052
but it still needed to sound original trilogy.

119
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,536
I will show you a few scenes from The Force Awakens

120
00:09:07,396 --> 00:09:08,717
with Kylo Ren's Force Freeze.

121
00:09:12,846 --> 00:09:16,228
So yeah, Kylo Ren and his ability Force Freeze,

122
00:09:16,408 --> 00:09:18,549
which surprisingly freezes the opponent

123
00:09:18,609 --> 00:09:19,749
for a duration of time,

124
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,830
which made this a looping ability,

125
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,171
it could differ in time.

126
00:09:24,212 --> 00:09:27,213
And as you saw, this ability had very clear reference

127
00:09:27,253 --> 00:09:29,174
from various scenes in The Force Awakens.

128
00:09:29,934 --> 00:09:32,476
And I could base my sound almost entirely

129
00:09:32,636 --> 00:09:34,317
on the sounds from the movie stems

130
00:09:34,477 --> 00:09:37,018
and the sounds that Lucas or Skywalker Sound

131
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:37,898
provided me with.

132
00:09:39,103 --> 00:09:41,785
Just a gentle massage to make them fit better into the game

133
00:09:42,045 --> 00:09:44,506
and some added elements for different perspectives

134
00:09:45,467 --> 00:09:46,728
and added variation.

135
00:09:48,469 --> 00:09:53,071
So when I started working on a new hero for this game,

136
00:09:53,271 --> 00:09:55,913
I always just wrote down a few words as a sound design

137
00:09:55,993 --> 00:09:58,274
direction for myself mainly.

138
00:09:58,754 --> 00:10:03,357
And for this character, I think Kylo Ren is, of course, evil.

139
00:10:03,577 --> 00:10:05,238
But he's still afraid as well.

140
00:10:05,881 --> 00:10:12,665
The sounds that David Accord made for him for the movie, they have a musical tone to them.

141
00:10:13,606 --> 00:10:20,711
They sound modern but also very distorted. So I started with extracting the sounds from the movie

142
00:10:20,731 --> 00:10:25,834
stems and I was quickly able to just make a loop out of the sounds.

143
00:10:27,102 --> 00:10:31,425
And I decided to split this looping sound into a noise

144
00:10:31,485 --> 00:10:32,766
layer and a tonal layer.

145
00:10:32,786 --> 00:10:35,307
And I will play you an example, and then I will tell

146
00:10:35,347 --> 00:10:36,128
you why I did this.

147
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:39,550
So the first sound you will hear is the reference from the

148
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,451
film and then my split loops.

149
00:11:13,811 --> 00:11:13,971
you

150
00:11:19,364 --> 00:11:22,025
So why did I do this?

151
00:11:23,126 --> 00:11:26,367
Since I split the loops, I could play them in two

152
00:11:26,387 --> 00:11:27,248
different samplers.

153
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:29,809
And I could have set them in time from each other.

154
00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:33,190
I could also apply different randomization, like LFOs and

155
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:36,712
the pitch and the amplitude, and just make a lot more

156
00:11:36,892 --> 00:11:39,133
randomization with quite short loops.

157
00:11:40,213 --> 00:11:43,715
And I could also route the tonal bass layer.

158
00:11:44,635 --> 00:11:46,597
into the subwoofer or the LFE channel

159
00:11:46,797 --> 00:11:51,782
without making the crisp noise layer unclear.

160
00:11:54,164 --> 00:11:56,786
After this, I needed to find some more variation

161
00:11:56,826 --> 00:11:58,407
for these sounds that I had extracted.

162
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:02,991
But I of course wanted them to have the exact same feeling

163
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:03,952
as the rest of the sounds.

164
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,355
And especially for the affected perspective,

165
00:12:07,615 --> 00:12:09,177
I needed to add some sounds.

166
00:12:10,632 --> 00:12:18,393
So I started searching and I found this boomy Canon sound that had the same kind of tonality

167
00:12:18,473 --> 00:12:20,974
and very nice tone to it.

168
00:12:22,014 --> 00:12:24,795
And I also did some sound effects recordings myself.

169
00:12:24,915 --> 00:12:33,196
I bought this huge party balloon and I took my LS100 Olympus recorder, handy recorder

170
00:12:34,229 --> 00:12:39,034
And I just pushed the membranes straight into the balloon

171
00:12:39,114 --> 00:12:40,075
and then ripped it away.

172
00:12:40,095 --> 00:12:42,818
And this made a really nice ripping sound.

173
00:12:43,699 --> 00:12:46,261
And I just added some distortion on that, and then

174
00:12:46,301 --> 00:12:49,204
it sounded quite a lot like Kylo Ren.

175
00:12:49,865 --> 00:12:51,227
I will play those two examples as well.

176
00:13:12,805 --> 00:13:16,566
Yeah, and after this, I basically just categorized

177
00:13:16,606 --> 00:13:18,867
the sounds that I had for the different perspectives

178
00:13:18,927 --> 00:13:20,828
and the different things that I needed to provide

179
00:13:22,228 --> 00:13:24,349
for Kylo Ren's close perspective,

180
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:26,549
the distant perspective, and also when you are

181
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:27,990
being affected by the ability.

182
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,030
And this is how it all sounds.

183
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:32,931
I will play the singles sounds first

184
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:34,192
and then a combined variation.

185
00:14:18,212 --> 00:14:22,862
And now let's look at it in game because it doesn't matter if it sounds good as a single sound,

186
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:25,809
it needs to be in the mix and it needs to fit there.

187
00:15:02,229 --> 00:15:06,412
So the next example is Darth Maul and I will start with

188
00:15:06,432 --> 00:15:08,033
showing a clip from the Phantom Menace.

189
00:15:30,245 --> 00:15:38,349
So yeah, Darth Maul from the prequel trilogy and this ability Force Bush had a clear reference

190
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:40,871
as you saw during the fight with Obi-Wan Kenobi.

191
00:15:42,052 --> 00:15:47,014
But I wasn't really able to use this sound for the game because the gameplay ability

192
00:15:47,055 --> 00:15:47,835
was quite different.

193
00:15:48,075 --> 00:15:51,557
So I needed to make a hybrid that hopefully worked equally well.

194
00:15:53,117 --> 00:15:56,043
And again, I started with the sound design direction.

195
00:15:57,186 --> 00:16:01,194
And to me, this character is angry, fast, silent.

196
00:16:01,274 --> 00:16:02,216
He doesn't speak a lot.

197
00:16:02,397 --> 00:16:03,599
He's furious and lethal.

198
00:16:06,334 --> 00:16:17,037
So I took the reference sound and sort of analyzed it and I found out that it's a soft kind of explosion with a lot of flanger on it.

199
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:26,500
And I wanted my sound to also keep that character of course, but I wanted it to sound a bit more 2018 and a lot more punchy.

200
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,401
So what I did is I created some new explosions with flanger on them.

201
00:16:31,721 --> 00:16:34,582
And I will play the reference sound and then my new explosions.

202
00:16:51,794 --> 00:17:00,136
And to be honest, when I started making this sound, I had a bit of a struggle to find a way and really know what I wanted to create.

203
00:17:01,517 --> 00:17:07,218
So at DICE in my studio, I always have an SM58 microphone just lying on my table.

204
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,600
So I can always grab it and just make sounds with my mouth and stuff.

205
00:17:13,014 --> 00:17:15,736
So what I did was that I booted up the game and just

206
00:17:15,796 --> 00:17:18,498
performed a sound with my voice.

207
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:22,381
And this is very silly, but it helps.

208
00:17:22,821 --> 00:17:26,884
And it makes just your thoughts or your sound that

209
00:17:26,904 --> 00:17:29,066
you have in your head, you can get it into Pro Tools or

210
00:17:29,106 --> 00:17:31,147
whatever in a very sort of fast way.

211
00:17:31,608 --> 00:17:34,289
And then you can start taking it apart and replacing it with

212
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,170
other sounds.

213
00:17:35,891 --> 00:17:37,552
And we'll play you the recording that I did.

214
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:40,214
And you will hear that it's actually not that far from the

215
00:17:40,254 --> 00:17:42,335
last, from the final result.

216
00:17:44,782 --> 00:17:45,823
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

217
00:17:46,484 --> 00:17:52,110
Roar, roar, yeah.

218
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:56,295
Bhai bhai yah!

219
00:17:58,478 --> 00:17:58,898
Very silly.

220
00:18:02,484 --> 00:18:09,687
So after this, I started thinking about what kinds of sounds that I could use to replace this

221
00:18:11,128 --> 00:18:16,270
and some evil sounds I wanted to create. And one of the most evil sounding things, I think, is

222
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:23,773
feedback. It sounds super, yeah, scary. So I recorded some feedback basically in my room. And

223
00:18:24,393 --> 00:18:27,974
then I also wanted to add some more sort of prequel-y tone to it.

224
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,642
So I got some synth sounds that Ben Mintow had made.

225
00:18:33,482 --> 00:18:37,624
And it added some raw power to it and the prequel character

226
00:18:37,664 --> 00:18:38,184
that I wanted.

227
00:18:39,404 --> 00:18:42,705
And this sound is basically very simple.

228
00:18:42,845 --> 00:18:47,127
It's the flanged explosions, the feedback, and the synth

229
00:18:47,207 --> 00:18:50,908
sound, and nothing too fancy, no fancy plugins and anything.

230
00:18:51,148 --> 00:18:53,089
And this could easily have been done by Ben

231
00:18:53,129 --> 00:18:54,550
Barrett very early.

232
00:18:56,275 --> 00:19:03,780
And I will play you the feedback recording and then some of the synth and then those two combined as well.

233
00:19:13,948 --> 00:19:17,050
This is probably very nice for you who are hangover as well.

234
00:19:34,835 --> 00:19:38,816
Yeah.

235
00:20:02,255 --> 00:20:09,427
And now let's listen to the whole sound with the flanged explosion as well and the distant variation.

236
00:20:40,397 --> 00:20:41,719
Let's look at it in game again.

237
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:17,032
And my next example is Luke Skywalker and since this ability doesn't exist in any movie,

238
00:21:17,273 --> 00:21:19,297
I will start with showing a clip from the game as well.

239
00:21:37,698 --> 00:21:46,704
So, Luke Skywalker and the Force repulse. And as I said, no reference at all from anywhere, so I had

240
00:21:46,724 --> 00:21:51,367
to come up with a completely new sound, but it still needed to sound very much like Star Wars,

241
00:21:51,607 --> 00:21:58,572
Luke Skywalker, and just expand the universe in a respectful way. And my sound design direction

242
00:21:58,592 --> 00:22:04,275
for this guy was powerful, trustful, dominant, natural and humane.

243
00:22:06,554 --> 00:22:13,459
And I started with doing some sound effect recordings for this ability and I wanted to

244
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:20,504
record some earthy tones, some sort of air sounds and the force from the ground because

245
00:22:20,544 --> 00:22:27,489
this ability basically has a charge up where the ground starts rumbling or like an earthquake

246
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:34,514
and then after that you have the force repulse explosion and for that I recorded some slinky.

247
00:22:36,697 --> 00:22:39,240
And I will play a few of the sounds that I found.

248
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:43,785
I found a baby alligator sound that I pitched down a lot,

249
00:22:43,865 --> 00:22:44,907
which sounded quite cool.

250
00:22:45,527 --> 00:22:47,129
And then some of the slinky stuff as well.

251
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:51,174
And I also used my balloon for this, for some air crackles.

252
00:22:52,255 --> 00:22:53,256
So yeah, let's listen.

253
00:23:45,897 --> 00:23:47,180
So that was my start.

254
00:23:48,462 --> 00:23:52,309
And I had to create a lot of content for disability because

255
00:23:52,329 --> 00:23:52,690
I had a

256
00:23:54,129 --> 00:23:57,890
the charge up or the sort of force from the ground sound

257
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:01,770
as a separate one shot, and then the force explosion as one.

258
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:05,351
And I needed to create first close

259
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:08,832
and distant perspectives for these sounds.

260
00:24:09,272 --> 00:24:11,472
And also they were quite modular in game.

261
00:24:11,552 --> 00:24:14,093
So for example, if you were outside,

262
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:16,133
you got debris effects and stuff like that.

263
00:24:16,253 --> 00:24:17,873
If you were inside, you didn't get that.

264
00:24:17,913 --> 00:24:20,554
So I needed to provide the sound that fit

265
00:24:20,594 --> 00:24:22,454
with the VFX and the visuals in the game.

266
00:24:23,234 --> 00:24:29,845
So we'll just play all the content that I made for this ability with the earthquakey stuff and the

267
00:24:30,766 --> 00:24:32,028
force repulse explosion.

268
00:26:04,214 --> 00:26:05,476
Let's look at it in game again.

269
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:25,411
I will do a quick conclusion on just the sound design part,

270
00:26:25,471 --> 00:26:27,372
but then I will talk about the system.

271
00:26:27,412 --> 00:26:29,774
So it's not done yet.

272
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:32,495
The sound design direction, I think,

273
00:26:32,555 --> 00:26:34,476
really helped making the sounds, especially

274
00:26:34,516 --> 00:26:36,758
in an early state of the sound design,

275
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:38,919
just to find the right path.

276
00:26:39,619 --> 00:26:42,081
And it feels like it's always good to think and search

277
00:26:42,121 --> 00:26:44,262
with an emotional direction in mind.

278
00:26:46,203 --> 00:26:51,766
The movie stems and the sound assets that we received from Skywalker Sound were extremely helpful.

279
00:26:52,146 --> 00:26:59,710
Even though we had to add a lot of sounds and change them, it provided us with a very good guide and also with a solid bass.

280
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:06,073
Unique sound effect recordings to try to find and record

281
00:27:06,113 --> 00:27:08,514
what is actually needed for a specific ability

282
00:27:08,674 --> 00:27:10,335
and tailored for a specific ability.

283
00:27:11,175 --> 00:27:13,456
It's always nicer to record something

284
00:27:13,496 --> 00:27:18,038
that sounds Star Wars or sounds correct for the ability

285
00:27:18,218 --> 00:27:20,278
than trying to shape something into sound,

286
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:21,379
sounding correctly.

287
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,080
Less is more.

288
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,941
The more in world and the more natural the sounds were,

289
00:27:28,121 --> 00:27:30,082
the better they fit the soundscape, it felt like.

290
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:39,837
The basic sound design technique that we used made it feel like we were just an extension of the creators of Star Wars from the beginning.

291
00:27:42,218 --> 00:27:47,440
And the vocalization sound design really helped. I will definitely use it in the future as well.

292
00:27:49,761 --> 00:27:51,362
So let's move on to the systems.

293
00:27:53,843 --> 00:27:58,605
So for this project our general philosophy was to make master patches.

294
00:27:59,989 --> 00:28:03,690
So we made master patches for explosions, blasters,

295
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,911
star fighters, hero abilities, all the big categories.

296
00:28:07,891 --> 00:28:11,632
And we had a lot of sounds to make for this game,

297
00:28:11,853 --> 00:28:15,354
so we needed to create solid, shared systems

298
00:28:15,834 --> 00:28:18,194
to be able to handle the large amount of sounds.

299
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:21,795
And for the last Battlefront game,

300
00:28:21,835 --> 00:28:23,936
we made a lot more unique solutions,

301
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:25,557
but we couldn't really do that this time.

302
00:28:27,153 --> 00:28:30,595
And this also helped keeping consistency.

303
00:28:32,116 --> 00:28:35,639
So the sounds were more consistent, and also between

304
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:37,920
different sound designers, since we all had to work on

305
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,141
different parts of the game.

306
00:28:43,204 --> 00:28:48,968
Also, these shared systems, a lot of sounds, they share

307
00:28:49,068 --> 00:28:49,869
sounds as well.

308
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:53,371
So it wouldn't really make sense to redo that logic for

309
00:28:53,471 --> 00:28:55,433
each sound and tweak it every time.

310
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:04,895
And this also helped the mixing process because we could do general changes to the whole category of sounds

311
00:29:05,416 --> 00:29:08,639
or otherwise just go in and tweak individual sounds very fast.

312
00:29:10,987 --> 00:29:14,529
And we had a thing called a sound patch configuration.

313
00:29:14,609 --> 00:29:18,471
So each sound had a sound patch configuration, which

314
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:23,014
inherits properties and parameters and values from the

315
00:29:23,054 --> 00:29:23,695
master patch.

316
00:29:24,335 --> 00:29:27,437
But it lets you switch out the sound assets that are used,

317
00:29:27,717 --> 00:29:29,158
even the ones that are shared, actually.

318
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:32,300
And you could enable and disable various layers.

319
00:29:33,801 --> 00:29:36,163
And you could tweak chosen properties from the master

320
00:29:36,203 --> 00:29:39,425
patch, but still maintain the foundation of it.

321
00:29:42,187 --> 00:29:45,489
So this is the master patch for hero abilities.

322
00:29:45,769 --> 00:29:48,430
And I will just quickly go through and tell you

323
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,031
what these red boxes are, and then we

324
00:29:50,071 --> 00:29:53,073
will zoom in and go into detail what they could be used for.

325
00:29:54,554 --> 00:29:58,056
So this is a SFX layer, an add-on one-shot layer

326
00:29:58,116 --> 00:29:59,937
for the main force element.

327
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:02,979
And this is the main force element.

328
00:30:04,674 --> 00:30:12,201
also one shot. And this is the loop SFX layer, an add on layer to the main loop part. And this is

329
00:30:12,421 --> 00:30:20,308
the main loop part. This box handles reflections and this abilities, I've said that so many

330
00:30:20,348 --> 00:30:24,852
times, debris. So, let's zoom in on this box. So, this is the main loop part. And this is the

331
00:30:26,027 --> 00:30:29,448
And just quickly first, an explanation what it is that

332
00:30:29,488 --> 00:30:30,649
you're looking at.

333
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:36,272
So these boxes here, we get a bunch of values from the game,

334
00:30:36,852 --> 00:30:37,653
triggers and stuff.

335
00:30:37,853 --> 00:30:43,575
We do logic, processing, math to modulate the amplitude of

336
00:30:43,616 --> 00:30:43,976
the pitch.

337
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:47,237
And then we send that into the sampler, or

338
00:30:47,718 --> 00:30:48,758
sound player, basically.

339
00:30:50,779 --> 00:30:57,203
math and the logic that we have before it will make the sampler play the sound in a

340
00:30:57,243 --> 00:31:09,811
certain way. So, with that, this layer I generally just added to give some gameplay feedback.

341
00:31:10,151 --> 00:31:15,314
And in this example I used it for the force choke ability. So when Darth Vader catches

342
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:18,956
someone in his grip, then I play a one shot sound and it could sound like this.

343
00:31:24,513 --> 00:31:25,014
Let's move on.

344
00:31:25,955 --> 00:31:27,316
The force main element.

345
00:31:28,717 --> 00:31:30,738
And this consists of three samplers.

346
00:31:31,659 --> 00:31:34,981
One force close, one force tail, one force distant.

347
00:31:35,822 --> 00:31:41,626
And the tail one is for the looping abilities.

348
00:31:41,706 --> 00:31:44,968
If I wanted to play a stop sound or a deactivate sound

349
00:31:45,008 --> 00:31:45,669
or something like that.

350
00:31:46,269 --> 00:31:48,931
And I didn't need to have a distant one of that one

351
00:31:48,971 --> 00:31:51,473
because it felt like I could instead just fade out

352
00:31:51,513 --> 00:31:52,394
the loop of distance.

353
00:31:53,342 --> 00:31:55,723
I will play you an example from Forest Lightning.

354
00:31:55,743 --> 00:31:58,183
Let's start with the forest close.

355
00:32:11,067 --> 00:32:13,507
And then the tail sound, or the stop, deactivate.

356
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,861
and a distant variation.

357
00:32:35,529 --> 00:32:35,910
Cool.

358
00:32:37,051 --> 00:32:38,832
So the loop SFX layer.

359
00:32:39,572 --> 00:32:42,295
This was very neat, because I could just add an element,

360
00:32:42,355 --> 00:32:45,337
but keep the main loop quite.

361
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:53,539
like as a foundation. I could also do stuff like fade in over time, pitch over time, increase the

362
00:32:53,579 --> 00:32:59,103
pitch for example, which I did for the four stroke ability as well. So if you're caught in a grip,

363
00:32:59,383 --> 00:33:05,807
I will slowly fade in the loop with the bone crackling and also increase the pitch slightly

364
00:33:05,867 --> 00:33:09,310
so that it becomes a bit nastier and it could sound like this.

365
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:26,214
And the next layer is the main loop layer.

366
00:33:26,494 --> 00:33:28,476
And it consists of two samplers.

367
00:33:29,598 --> 00:33:32,541
And they could fade in and out of each other seamlessly,

368
00:33:33,062 --> 00:33:35,905
depending if you're running towards the sound or away from

369
00:33:35,945 --> 00:33:36,365
the sound.

370
00:33:37,687 --> 00:33:41,351
And the example that I will play here is an ability called

371
00:33:41,371 --> 00:33:42,052
dark aura.

372
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:44,234
And I will start with a close one.

373
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:57,930
and then the distant.

374
00:34:11,352 --> 00:34:13,133
Let's move on to the reflections.

375
00:34:14,493 --> 00:34:16,893
A very important layer because this

376
00:34:17,353 --> 00:34:20,754
really makes it sound like it's coming from the world and the sound is

377
00:34:20,794 --> 00:34:23,675
being created and reverberating through the environment.

378
00:34:24,616 --> 00:34:27,599
And these sounds were all shared amongst all the ability sounds,

379
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,163
but I had the possibility to turn it off if I didn't need it.

380
00:34:32,264 --> 00:34:35,467
And we had five different area types for this game.

381
00:34:36,048 --> 00:34:40,072
Field, forest, canyon slash urban, indoor small,

382
00:34:40,192 --> 00:34:40,953
and indoor large.

383
00:34:41,113 --> 00:34:44,396
And I will play two samples per each area type.

384
00:35:19,793 --> 00:35:26,520
The debris. These sounds were also shared amongst all the ability sounds, and the same as the

385
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,784
reflection, so I could just turn it off if I didn't need it. And we had a lot of different

386
00:35:30,945 --> 00:35:38,012
debris sounds for different materials, but I will just play three of them. Rock, snow, and vegetation.

387
00:36:01,516 --> 00:36:06,663
Something that was also good with both these layers were that I could play them, for example, on the

388
00:36:06,783 --> 00:36:13,032
start sound. I could also play them on the activate or the tail sound so I could use this for

389
00:36:13,072 --> 00:36:17,899
different abilities. So let's move on to the processing or the DSP.

390
00:36:20,424 --> 00:36:25,807
This box handles the LFE filtering and this was a new approach for us.

391
00:36:26,307 --> 00:36:31,630
In previous titles we had always had a specific sample playing for the LFE but this was a

392
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:32,490
bit more costly.

393
00:36:32,871 --> 00:36:40,335
You needed a specific sample, a sampler for the LFE and it could also cause face cancellation

394
00:36:40,395 --> 00:36:40,995
and stuff like that.

395
00:36:41,095 --> 00:36:44,277
So we tried this approach for this game and I think it worked out really well.

396
00:36:45,192 --> 00:36:50,735
We could also, for example, ADSR the LFE send so that way it

397
00:36:50,755 --> 00:36:54,596
didn't rumble too long in the LFE to keep it clean.

398
00:36:56,157 --> 00:36:58,658
And this part is the distant filtering.

399
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:02,479
And this just helps gluing the close sound to the distant

400
00:37:02,499 --> 00:37:06,721
sound, and also then after a while on further distant,

401
00:37:06,821 --> 00:37:09,022
making the distant sound even more distant.

402
00:37:11,399 --> 00:37:16,121
And this part is a slapback delay that we do with raycast.

403
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:18,022
So we have four raycasts on the player.

404
00:37:18,783 --> 00:37:23,645
And so these raycasts calculate the slapback or the delay time.

405
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:29,908
And this really helps gluing the noisy reflection layer

406
00:37:30,068 --> 00:37:32,589
to the more tonal force layer.

407
00:37:32,649 --> 00:37:35,951
So I just route the force one shot, for example,

408
00:37:35,991 --> 00:37:36,351
through this.

409
00:37:37,131 --> 00:37:41,353
And this is, of course, depending on the environment you are standing in, you will get a different

410
00:37:41,393 --> 00:37:42,353
slapback in quad.

411
00:37:45,014 --> 00:37:46,495
And this part is a flanger.

412
00:37:46,895 --> 00:37:50,777
And this I mainly used for the looping abilities.

413
00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:56,379
So on angular velocity when you move your character, I add a slight flanging effect

414
00:37:56,419 --> 00:37:59,041
just to make it get some variation.

415
00:37:59,081 --> 00:38:00,681
And also it sounds a bit more Star Wars.

416
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,158
And these are the outputs.

417
00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:10,120
The LFE output in the top, the object output placed where the

418
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:17,701
sound is created, and last, the flat slapback in the quad.

419
00:38:21,482 --> 00:38:23,783
And as you see, I didn't show you the whole patch,

420
00:38:23,863 --> 00:38:27,304
actually, so there is a big block over here that I need to

421
00:38:27,344 --> 00:38:28,764
go through before we're done.

422
00:38:29,484 --> 00:38:30,765
And this is also extremely.

423
00:38:31,618 --> 00:38:37,581
important. It's a cam shake and a pad rumble, or the sound driven cam shake and pad rumble.

424
00:38:38,561 --> 00:38:45,944
So I could shake the camera and add pad rumble to my abilities and this really helps making them

425
00:38:47,285 --> 00:38:54,327
powerful. And I could also with this one do it on the start sound, on the stop sound,

426
00:38:54,427 --> 00:38:58,909
I could also do a slight cam shake throughout the looping ability, for example.

427
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:07,124
And uh, just to make it a bit more clear what I meant with the sound patch configuration. So, we

428
00:39:08,404 --> 00:39:15,909
looked at the master patch and then I take all these values and parameters and shared sounds

429
00:39:15,969 --> 00:39:21,413
and stuff and the, the sound patch configuration inherits those things in this view that you

430
00:39:21,433 --> 00:39:24,775
see. So, the sound patch configuration.

431
00:39:26,576 --> 00:39:29,758
And I could configure chosen parameters.

432
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:35,201
And this sound patch configuration have sound slots

433
00:39:35,261 --> 00:39:37,882
so I could switch out the sounds, even the shared assets,

434
00:39:37,962 --> 00:39:39,723
if I just wanted to change one of those.

435
00:39:40,604 --> 00:39:43,085
I could enable and disable various layers.

436
00:39:43,385 --> 00:39:45,366
And this also made it a bit more optimized.

437
00:39:46,187 --> 00:39:49,749
And this was also where I could start and stop various layers

438
00:39:49,829 --> 00:39:51,510
from each other, offset from each other.

439
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:53,511
I could do the cam shake per sound.

440
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,962
And since I can't go into too much detail,

441
00:39:57,982 --> 00:40:00,424
I will just show you a picture of how it looks.

442
00:40:01,005 --> 00:40:03,627
And then if you are interested in more,

443
00:40:03,727 --> 00:40:05,528
you can look at the GDC Vault.

444
00:40:06,169 --> 00:40:08,230
Martin Loxton from Frostbite Audio

445
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,831
had a presentation about it.

446
00:40:10,392 --> 00:40:13,334
And the presentation is called Smart Sound Design Using

447
00:40:13,434 --> 00:40:15,816
Modularity and Data Inheritance.

448
00:40:18,078 --> 00:40:20,480
So I will show you a few clips of how

449
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:24,303
the area types work in the game and the materials as well.

450
00:40:55,394 --> 00:41:01,063
and another video with how we handle the distant processing and also if the sound is created

451
00:41:01,183 --> 00:41:02,946
indoor and you are outdoor for example.

452
00:42:09,117 --> 00:42:10,638
So let's summarize.

453
00:42:13,179 --> 00:42:16,041
For this game, we had a lot more heroes.

454
00:42:16,081 --> 00:42:19,083
You can see it was more than twice as many.

455
00:42:20,243 --> 00:42:28,027
And to make around 180 WAV files with around 5 to 10 variations,

456
00:42:28,107 --> 00:42:29,308
so it was a lot to create.

457
00:42:30,249 --> 00:42:32,090
And we wouldn't have been able to do this

458
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,591
without the sound patch configuration

459
00:42:34,651 --> 00:42:35,651
and the shared systems.

460
00:42:38,012 --> 00:42:41,193
We also focused a lot more on the gameplay feedback

461
00:42:41,253 --> 00:42:45,496
and added content for distant sounds for the abilities

462
00:42:45,856 --> 00:42:47,977
and the affected perspective, as well as

463
00:42:48,157 --> 00:42:49,338
dealing and taking damage.

464
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:55,362
And we took one further step in making it even more in-world

465
00:42:55,942 --> 00:42:58,403
and with the debris and the reflections

466
00:42:58,683 --> 00:43:00,745
and the raycast-driven delay.

467
00:43:03,937 --> 00:43:07,039
And the mix was a lot less compressed, as I said,

468
00:43:07,059 --> 00:43:12,182
and more focused, and a lot more readable for the player.

469
00:43:12,562 --> 00:43:13,763
And this was a big improvement

470
00:43:13,803 --> 00:43:16,645
from Star Wars Battlefront, the first one.

471
00:43:21,769 --> 00:43:22,649
Questions you have?

472
00:43:22,669 --> 00:43:28,433
Thank you.

473
00:43:28,633 --> 00:43:28,813
Thank you.

474
00:43:28,833 --> 00:43:29,014
Thank you.

475
00:43:29,034 --> 00:43:29,614
Thank you.

476
00:43:29,934 --> 00:43:32,236
Thank you.

477
00:43:32,336 --> 00:43:32,516
Thank you.

478
00:43:32,536 --> 00:43:32,716
Thank you.

479
00:43:32,796 --> 00:43:32,976
Thank you.

480
00:43:33,016 --> 00:43:33,196
Thank you.

481
00:43:34,434 --> 00:43:44,516
Let me get started. I have a few. Um, let's see. Boop. Maybe someone here has a question already.

482
00:43:44,536 --> 00:43:52,737
Right? Uh, hey, great presentation and great sounding game. I enjoyed it a lot. Um, for the

483
00:43:52,837 --> 00:43:57,038
indoor and outdoor, are you marking this up manually or you're detecting this procedurally?

484
00:43:57,058 --> 00:44:01,459
Yeah, we are marking it manually. Just with areas.

485
00:44:04,697 --> 00:44:06,838
Alright, so now I got it.

486
00:44:07,698 --> 00:44:11,398
You mentioned that there was very little visual feedback for the abilities

487
00:44:11,478 --> 00:44:13,559
and that Lucas didn't want it to be magical.

488
00:44:13,979 --> 00:44:14,779
Yeah.

489
00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:20,100
How did you do that with the gameplay guys and you to make sure that it was still readable?

490
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:25,301
Because I imagine it was especially hard for the game designers to make sure that

491
00:44:25,881 --> 00:44:29,122
even though there's nothing visual there, that the mechanic was clear.

492
00:44:30,382 --> 00:44:34,303
Yeah, that was a hard question actually.

493
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,521
Yeah, I'm familiar with it.

494
00:44:37,561 --> 00:44:37,841
Yeah.

495
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,162
I'm not really sure, actually.

496
00:44:40,442 --> 00:44:43,202
Like, I collaborated with game designers a lot.

497
00:44:43,463 --> 00:44:46,703
So sometimes maybe they didn't actually

498
00:44:46,743 --> 00:44:50,504
need to have a super visual VFX for anything,

499
00:44:50,544 --> 00:44:52,845
because the sound could provide that sound,

500
00:44:52,885 --> 00:44:55,226
and you could easily know where it came from and stuff

501
00:44:55,246 --> 00:44:55,566
like that.

502
00:44:56,246 --> 00:45:00,167
And I think also Lucasfilm probably

503
00:45:00,207 --> 00:45:03,408
wanted the VFX and the visuals to be quite sort of.

504
00:45:04,398 --> 00:45:12,083
down to earth and simple as well in a way. Of course there are very sort of magical looking

505
00:45:12,123 --> 00:45:16,807
things as well but yeah I think it was just a combination so if we could do it with just

506
00:45:16,827 --> 00:45:22,430
the sound and the animation it it worked. Was it something that you gameplay tested a lot and

507
00:45:22,611 --> 00:45:27,714
did you iterate on it like that? Yeah yeah absolutely yeah we created a lot of abilities

508
00:45:27,754 --> 00:45:31,457
that we sort of scrapped as well and just had to start over.

509
00:45:32,218 --> 00:45:36,252
So we were playtesting a lot and just finding the right path.

510
00:45:37,264 --> 00:45:40,927
And on the question about actually the relationship with the gameplay guys and the visual guys,

511
00:45:40,987 --> 00:45:47,592
because you mentioned that the sound was driving the camera shake, which from a perspective

512
00:45:47,652 --> 00:45:50,254
of making it really work, sounds like a great idea.

513
00:45:50,754 --> 00:45:55,117
But I can also imagine that some of the people in the design team or possibly on the visual

514
00:45:55,137 --> 00:45:59,541
side might have a bit of a problem with the sound team being responsible for the actual

515
00:45:59,581 --> 00:46:00,021
camera.

516
00:46:01,242 --> 00:46:02,923
So how did you handle that?

517
00:46:02,963 --> 00:46:05,885
Did they have some control over it after you guys, or did you just...

518
00:46:06,292 --> 00:46:10,955
No, it was just me basically, but of course I also showed them what I did.

519
00:46:11,315 --> 00:46:21,120
And they also do some cam shake actually, but this was more for the actual moment where the sound is the biggest.

520
00:46:22,124 --> 00:46:28,045
But it's very hard with the camshake especially because some people don't like it at all.

521
00:46:28,765 --> 00:46:32,065
And of course it can prevent very fast gameplay.

522
00:46:32,585 --> 00:46:36,386
But it really does make a difference for the feel of the ability.

523
00:46:36,946 --> 00:46:42,347
So we just found the right path and not too much but we didn't overdo it either.

524
00:46:43,207 --> 00:46:47,488
Was that only for the multiplayer or was that also for the singleplayer?

525
00:46:47,508 --> 00:46:48,928
Also for the singleplayer for sure.

526
00:46:50,156 --> 00:46:51,158
And you mentioned that

527
00:46:53,192 --> 00:46:57,015
you couldn't have the unique solutions that you could on the previous project.

528
00:46:57,055 --> 00:47:00,757
Was that simply because of the scope increase and the same amount of time?

529
00:47:00,777 --> 00:47:05,781
Yeah, we had a lot less time and we had to create a lot more sounds.

530
00:47:06,521 --> 00:47:10,944
And we tried to make shared systems for the first one as well,

531
00:47:11,025 --> 00:47:17,069
but after a while it was like we had a lot of new gameplay features and stuff like that,

532
00:47:17,489 --> 00:47:18,550
so we just had to make it.

533
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:22,433
So we made a lot more sound patches with specific logic in them.

534
00:47:23,013 --> 00:47:28,175
But this time it was like, okay, so we have at least stuff to base on, like the first Star Wars game,

535
00:47:28,215 --> 00:47:35,678
so we could make those systems shared and just improve on those so that we could use them more easily for different kinds of sounds.

536
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:37,439
Cool. Thanks.

537
00:47:37,899 --> 00:47:38,139
Thank you.

538
00:47:40,094 --> 00:47:40,294
Hi.

539
00:47:41,035 --> 00:47:43,977
Thanks so much for the talk, and great talk, great sound

540
00:47:44,017 --> 00:47:44,677
examples as well.

541
00:47:45,458 --> 00:47:49,701
I have a curiosity about the close and distant perspective

542
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:52,143
specifically in terms of the asset creation.

543
00:47:52,863 --> 00:47:57,867
So as a process, is it more about finding different sounds

544
00:47:57,987 --> 00:48:01,349
to work from, or is it more of a processing thing

545
00:48:01,389 --> 00:48:04,371
that you do within your DAW, or is it a mix of two?

546
00:48:06,533 --> 00:48:11,663
It's a mix of course, but for example the explosions, like a real explosion,

547
00:48:11,723 --> 00:48:14,969
it will sound different depending on how far you are from it.

548
00:48:16,499 --> 00:48:21,482
So I always try to completely change those sounds for example

549
00:48:22,042 --> 00:48:25,184
But also try to just with the plugins and stuff

550
00:48:27,105 --> 00:48:34,049
Modulate or like create the sort of a real world behavior for I mean some of these sounds are quite

551
00:48:34,349 --> 00:48:40,472
Strange and there are not like a recording of these on distance, so I had to make something that that worked

552
00:48:41,233 --> 00:48:44,535
But yeah, we do try to change a lot of sounds so that they sound

553
00:48:45,535 --> 00:48:45,875
Distance

554
00:48:46,464 --> 00:48:46,724
Thank you.

555
00:48:48,866 --> 00:48:53,490
For the filtering LFE technique, was it really just

556
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:55,771
using the filter as a crossover?

557
00:48:55,831 --> 00:48:59,754
Was there any additional massaging processing to

558
00:48:59,954 --> 00:49:01,315
optimize the effect?

559
00:49:02,376 --> 00:49:03,877
It was a crossover.

560
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:06,202
Exactly.

561
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:10,924
And then we don't send the full sound into the LFE, we can

562
00:49:10,964 --> 00:49:14,766
just send a little bump of it so we can do the attack.

563
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:17,287
We don't have to rumble it all through the subwoofer.

564
00:49:17,767 --> 00:49:18,007
Terrific.

565
00:49:18,307 --> 00:49:18,547
Thank you.

566
00:49:20,419 --> 00:49:22,141
Hi, so I have a thank you for the talk.

567
00:49:22,162 --> 00:49:23,123
I have a couple of questions.

568
00:49:24,505 --> 00:49:27,729
So additionally to the different samples

569
00:49:27,869 --> 00:49:30,713
for the different perspectives, did you

570
00:49:30,833 --> 00:49:33,096
add some real-time processing to the sounds?

571
00:49:33,156 --> 00:49:36,080
Like do you still have, do you add reverb in real time?

572
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,883
Or is it just like the, yeah?

573
00:49:38,121 --> 00:49:45,165
Yeah, we do add reverb depending on the area that you're in and then also the stuff that I showed

574
00:49:45,205 --> 00:49:49,028
with the DSP processing like the filtering and the slap backs and stuff like that.

575
00:49:49,308 --> 00:49:56,192
Okay. Yeah. And did you have variations for like when you're playing a certain hero and when

576
00:49:56,232 --> 00:50:00,755
you're against a certain hero or is it exactly the same sounds in both cases?

577
00:50:02,789 --> 00:50:04,250
What do you mean exactly?

578
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:10,596
Like, is there a difference in the sounds you play when you're against a certain hero?

579
00:50:10,616 --> 00:50:11,116
Ah, I see, I see.

580
00:50:11,176 --> 00:50:14,039
And when you play it, or is it exactly the same?

581
00:50:14,259 --> 00:50:20,484
It's the same, but when you're in third person, like you have the camera, you know, you are the character.

582
00:50:21,065 --> 00:50:24,928
Then I play certain sounds, or you most of them.

583
00:50:25,269 --> 00:50:29,030
or you get the close perspective all the time of course but if you were

584
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:31,731
uh... an enemy or a friendly and uh...

585
00:50:32,191 --> 00:50:35,232
the hero runs around you will get the different sounds all the time so.

586
00:50:35,492 --> 00:50:39,014
Okay so the perspective makes the work for uh... yeah exactly.

587
00:50:39,514 --> 00:50:44,495
uh... and uh... so I uh... some sounds are really uh... long have a pretty long tail

588
00:50:44,516 --> 00:50:48,337
especially like Luke Skywalker's you can hear uh... the echo in the distance so what

589
00:50:48,357 --> 00:50:52,018
happens to to that kind of stuff when you have the full mix and uh...

590
00:50:52,138 --> 00:50:53,699
everybody's like firing and etc.

591
00:50:54,459 --> 00:51:01,625
Yeah, I mean you can't do that for every sound but it glues the mix together as well and makes it just have a sort of depth to it.

592
00:51:02,066 --> 00:51:07,210
But that was quite a specific case, that was very long.

593
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:14,096
But it was a very powerful ability and I wanted it to sound big so then I made it big.

594
00:51:16,043 --> 00:51:20,848
But we do sometimes as well, if you have a tail in the sound,

595
00:51:20,908 --> 00:51:23,890
we can make the release time shorter.

596
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:26,232
Or you make the tail shorter, for example,

597
00:51:26,272 --> 00:51:30,016
when you're indoors, so that you can add the indoor reflections

598
00:51:30,216 --> 00:51:33,038
on that instead of having the thunder tail.

599
00:51:34,237 --> 00:51:36,899
But is it something that you drop for example if you have too

600
00:51:36,939 --> 00:51:41,262
many uh person firing and uh some explosions so maybe you

601
00:51:41,302 --> 00:51:44,324
don't want to hear the tail that time? Yeah. Uh I mean our

602
00:51:44,344 --> 00:51:49,187
HD uh our system uh does that for us basically. And also some

603
00:51:49,247 --> 00:51:54,290
scoping. Okay. And last one um so you work um the your custom

604
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:58,213
audio engine is like you work 100 percent in it or do you uh

605
00:51:58,353 --> 00:52:01,895
okay. Yeah. So there is no wise or uh stuff like that. No. Not

606
00:52:02,335 --> 00:52:03,276
Thank you. Thank you.

607
00:52:05,788 --> 00:52:07,549
Hello, thank you very much for the talk.

608
00:52:08,269 --> 00:52:11,311
I'm wondering because there's so many super,

609
00:52:11,351 --> 00:52:14,474
very natural locations, like you're on Hoth,

610
00:52:14,494 --> 00:52:16,695
and there's the snow-covered canyon, or you're on Endor,

611
00:52:16,755 --> 00:52:18,036
and there's all this foliage.

612
00:52:18,516 --> 00:52:24,200
What kind of recording was done to make those locations seem

613
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,241
like they're real?

614
00:52:25,261 --> 00:52:27,322
Was there a lot of field recording done?

615
00:52:27,842 --> 00:52:34,585
Yeah, absolutely. A lot. I always have my recorder with me and I know that Ben Mintoy, he went to

616
00:52:34,765 --> 00:52:40,587
Iceland for example, recorded the real mud pits for the first game and also snow and stuff for

617
00:52:40,647 --> 00:52:46,030
Hoth. So we tried to go to the real locations. We also went to the Redwood Forest and but we

618
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:49,331
also tried to base it on what Ben Burtt and these other...

619
00:52:49,835 --> 00:52:51,275
fantastic sound designers made.

620
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:56,058
So we take their recordings and then we might change them

621
00:52:56,498 --> 00:53:00,460
and put in new content so that it sounds a bit fresher maybe.

622
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,182
But yeah, a lot of field recording.

623
00:53:03,922 --> 00:53:04,222
Thank you.

624
00:53:06,824 --> 00:53:07,404
Two more questions.

625
00:53:08,064 --> 00:53:09,905
First, what was your memory budget

626
00:53:10,026 --> 00:53:14,168
and how did you meet that using the swapping out sounds?

627
00:53:14,208 --> 00:53:15,228
Like how dynamic was the?

628
00:53:16,908 --> 00:53:18,029
the loading and unloading?

629
00:53:18,289 --> 00:53:21,190
So the memory body that I can't remember...

630
00:53:22,171 --> 00:53:22,471
It was...

631
00:53:24,031 --> 00:53:24,392
big enough.

632
00:53:24,892 --> 00:53:25,732
Big enough?

633
00:53:27,773 --> 00:53:30,614
And second question, how big was your sound team?

634
00:53:31,255 --> 00:53:34,256
Like both sound designers, audio programmers. It seems like maybe

635
00:53:34,976 --> 00:53:37,337
the sound designers here are doing a lot of like programming.

636
00:53:38,546 --> 00:53:39,327
in the tool?

637
00:53:39,367 --> 00:53:46,154
Yeah, we were, I think we peaked on like 12 people from Dice, but then we collaborated

638
00:53:46,234 --> 00:53:48,296
with Motive and Criterion as well.

639
00:53:48,816 --> 00:53:52,460
And so I think in total, Rosa, how many were we?

640
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:53,961
Like 25-ish?

641
00:53:54,121 --> 00:53:54,261
Yeah.

642
00:53:54,281 --> 00:53:57,264
Rosa is from Criterion.

643
00:53:57,324 --> 00:53:57,705
Cool, thank you.

644
00:53:57,745 --> 00:53:57,825
Yeah.

645
00:53:58,846 --> 00:53:58,966
Hey.

646
00:53:59,506 --> 00:53:59,887
Cool, thank you.

647
00:53:59,907 --> 00:53:59,987
Yeah.

648
00:54:00,227 --> 00:54:02,750
Cool, thank you.

649
00:54:03,847 --> 00:54:08,110
I had a question about the dynamic mix. I didn't see any

650
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:12,092
nodes in your master patch that sort of alluded to an HDR system

651
00:54:12,172 --> 00:54:13,493
or the mixing I would imagine.

652
00:54:14,055 --> 00:54:15,876
with all the force powers and the low end,

653
00:54:16,416 --> 00:54:18,778
the clutter of the mix had some challenges.

654
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:21,540
So how did you address that kind of dynamically in the mix?

655
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,081
Yeah.

656
00:54:22,681 --> 00:54:24,623
So we do the HDR.

657
00:54:24,663 --> 00:54:27,545
We set the loudness or the priority of it in the outputs.

658
00:54:27,805 --> 00:54:31,468
So there are no nodes for it, basically.

659
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:32,448
But yeah, we're.

660
00:54:34,833 --> 00:54:41,836
definitely needed the HDR to figure this out and also in the game mode, Heroes vs. Villains,

661
00:54:42,357 --> 00:54:46,619
there are a lot of sounds playing all the time and they are of course quite huge as

662
00:54:46,659 --> 00:54:52,581
well because you are all heroes. So yeah, it was a tough one. But it helped a lot with

663
00:54:52,621 --> 00:54:54,722
the HDR system. That I can tell you.

664
00:54:56,747 --> 00:55:04,389
Hey. So for every power, how many baked variations of every sound would you make for one

665
00:55:04,409 --> 00:55:13,431
perspective? I think, yeah, as I said in the conclusion, I think I made around five to ten

666
00:55:13,471 --> 00:55:19,112
variations of every sound. But then of course there were cases where I had a lot more

667
00:55:19,192 --> 00:55:22,933
sounds or I just found a lot more variations and then I could create that. So.

668
00:55:23,633 --> 00:55:26,414
some sounds probably had, I don't know, 25 even.

669
00:55:27,435 --> 00:55:32,297
So it could vary a lot, but that's sort of the ballpark of how many variations,

670
00:55:32,337 --> 00:55:34,038
so that you don't get too much repetition.

671
00:55:34,478 --> 00:55:39,100
And as for one power, how much time would you spend making just one power?

672
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,501
A day, two days?

673
00:55:40,521 --> 00:55:45,763
Yeah, I think like a day or something.

674
00:55:46,004 --> 00:55:49,165
Sometimes I had to redo and of course I iterated on it, but...

675
00:55:50,284 --> 00:55:51,665
Yeah, I would say maybe a day.

676
00:55:52,485 --> 00:55:54,025
Or half a day sometimes when it was quick.

677
00:55:54,506 --> 00:55:56,746
And a lot longer sometimes as well.

678
00:55:56,846 --> 00:56:00,768
But yeah.

679
00:56:01,248 --> 00:56:02,528
Reverb-related questions.

680
00:56:02,688 --> 00:56:05,649
So for reverb, are you guys programmatically sort

681
00:56:05,669 --> 00:56:08,150
of generating your reverb zones, or are you hand-tuning those?

682
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:10,491
And how many reverbs are you running?

683
00:56:11,571 --> 00:56:13,892
We are hand-tuning all the areas,

684
00:56:14,352 --> 00:56:18,133
and then we can set an IR reverb to that specific area.

685
00:56:19,274 --> 00:56:23,478
And I think we can have three IORs playing at the same time,

686
00:56:23,518 --> 00:56:25,459
but that's, of course, extremely costly.

687
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:29,483
And also, they can't be too long, because I did that once

688
00:56:29,583 --> 00:56:31,345
and I had a crash and people were angry.

689
00:56:32,065 --> 00:56:34,167
It sounded very good, but the game crashed.

690
00:56:34,187 --> 00:56:35,708
Yeah, I bet.

691
00:56:35,748 --> 00:56:35,969
Thanks.

692
00:56:40,252 --> 00:56:40,433
Yeah.

693
00:56:40,993 --> 00:56:42,014
Thank you so much for coming.
