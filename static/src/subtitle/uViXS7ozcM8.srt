1
00:00:08,128 --> 00:00:13,911
Okay, I'm going to get started. Thanks for coming down again. This is Keep It Together,

2
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:18,594
where we're going to be talking about how to get players to cooperate with each other

3
00:00:18,874 --> 00:00:26,718
when they're playing in co-op games. So, I'm Patrick Redding. I'm currently a game director

4
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:32,640
at the new Ubisoft Toronto studio. We opened a little over a year ago. Prior to that, I

5
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,162
spent about five and a half years, six years at the Ubisoft Montreal studio.

6
00:00:36,981 --> 00:00:41,463
where most recently I was the co-op game director on Splinter Cell Conviction.

7
00:00:42,344 --> 00:00:45,085
And then before that I was the narrative designer on Far Cry 2,

8
00:00:45,926 --> 00:00:51,909
and then played various game design roles on the last generation of consoles, Far Cry

9
00:00:51,949 --> 00:00:52,169
games.

10
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,472
But today, I'm going to talk about player cooperation.

11
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:03,055
And I mean this in the sort of most obvious, explicit possible way.

12
00:01:03,135 --> 00:01:04,535
I'm not talking about...

13
00:01:05,152 --> 00:01:10,795
cooperation in the sense of when players get together and agree to abide by the same rules.

14
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:15,917
I'm not talking about stepping into the magic circle or any of that stuff. I mean actually

15
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:22,019
players working together to try to overcome the challenges that are posed by the computer.

16
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,002
So co-op play. Before I get into that, I just want to step

17
00:01:27,042 --> 00:01:31,944
back a couple weeks ago to an article that I was reading on Greg Castigan's blog, which

18
00:01:32,024 --> 00:01:32,784
is Play This Thing.

19
00:01:33,645 --> 00:01:38,346
And there was an article posted by one of his regular blog contributors.

20
00:01:38,366 --> 00:01:40,167
It goes by JZW.

21
00:01:41,307 --> 00:01:46,788
And JZW was asking, he was sort of thinking about the current situation in the Mideast

22
00:01:46,968 --> 00:01:51,069
and some of the recent popular uprisings that have taken place in places like Egypt and

23
00:01:51,249 --> 00:01:52,069
Algeria and whatnot.

24
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:59,111
And he was asking, if someone was to make a game that was about a modern, non-violent

25
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:01,452
revolution, what would that game look like?

26
00:02:02,699 --> 00:02:06,040
And this, you know, this prompted kind of a lively discussion on the comments thread,

27
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,201
in which a variety of people brought up different games that they had seen over the years they

28
00:02:10,241 --> 00:02:11,402
thought kind of fit the bill.

29
00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:14,763
Games that this is a force more powerful from a few years ago.

30
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:20,124
And pretty quickly the author had to kind of push back and say, well hang on, a lot

31
00:02:20,164 --> 00:02:23,925
of the games that people are talking about are games in which the player is kind of a

32
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:25,306
revolution tycoon.

33
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:30,967
He's somebody who's sort of taking all of the resources that make up the populace.

34
00:02:31,565 --> 00:02:35,386
and figuring out how to allocate them in support of a revolutionary movement

35
00:02:35,686 --> 00:02:37,706
in order to take down the man, as it were.

36
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:41,407
And his point was that in real life, as we've seen

37
00:02:42,107 --> 00:02:44,668
somewhat vividly, somewhat tragically in some cases,

38
00:02:45,548 --> 00:02:47,368
real revolutions are started from within.

39
00:02:47,848 --> 00:02:50,849
They're started by people whose necks are every bit

40
00:02:51,369 --> 00:02:54,010
as much on the line as the people who they're organizing.

41
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:55,970
And that furthermore,

42
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,451
the nature of this kind of movement is that...

43
00:03:00,283 --> 00:03:06,888
It started by people reaching out to their friends and to their family and to members of their immediate community,

44
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:12,553
the people with whom they share all of the common interests that lead them to have a grievance in the first place.

45
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:21,380
That it's not about just simply sticking a YouTube video on the Internet and then having 20,000 people show up in a public square the next day.

46
00:03:22,441 --> 00:03:27,665
And there has been kind of a popular misconception, I think, in the last couple of years

47
00:03:28,326 --> 00:03:28,926
that somehow...

48
00:03:29,912 --> 00:03:32,234
modern non-violent revolutionary movements

49
00:03:32,935 --> 00:03:33,996
come about as a sort of

50
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:35,377
smart mob

51
00:03:35,397 --> 00:03:37,558
uh... with slightly higher stakes

52
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:42,282
uh... that the fabric of the twitterverse has somehow just kind of given rise to

53
00:03:42,302 --> 00:03:42,903
these movements

54
00:03:43,283 --> 00:03:44,384
in some kind of magical

55
00:03:44,944 --> 00:03:45,645
emergent way

56
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,327
and in fact this doesn't turn out to be true at all

57
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:52,150
it turns out that the same kinds of strong social links

58
00:03:52,991 --> 00:03:56,374
that were needed five thousand years ago or five hundred years ago or fifty years

59
00:03:56,434 --> 00:03:56,594
ago

60
00:03:57,822 --> 00:04:00,583
are just as critical and important now as ever.

61
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:05,165
That it's not going to be your 958 Facebook friends

62
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,867
that are going to help you when you're up against the tanks and the barricades.

63
00:04:10,268 --> 00:04:13,089
And the reason why this is ought to be relatively apparent,

64
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,431
but there's some non-trivial consequences to it.

65
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:19,413
Basically, if you're dangling at the end of the string,

66
00:04:19,713 --> 00:04:22,114
if it's an existential stake that you're up against,

67
00:04:23,415 --> 00:04:26,216
then those strong social links that you're depending on

68
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:29,180
are a mechanism for negotiation.

69
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:36,522
You're depending on the fact that you have license to negotiate action in the service

70
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:37,802
of some kind of collective goal.

71
00:04:38,502 --> 00:04:42,704
And what's interesting is that the negotiation actually helps to reinforce those strong social

72
00:04:42,744 --> 00:04:47,585
links and then the strong social links in turn help to reinforce and enable the negotiated

73
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:47,945
action.

74
00:04:50,646 --> 00:04:55,147
When we apply this to other types of collective goals.

75
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,862
say the collective goals associated with an alternate reality game or even an online multiplayer

76
00:05:00,882 --> 00:05:06,227
game, something like World of Warcraft. What we find is that the same effect is true, obviously

77
00:05:06,327 --> 00:05:12,752
slightly smaller stakes, but players become invested primarily in the success of their

78
00:05:12,772 --> 00:05:17,655
collaborative partners because of that ongoing process of negotiation, because of those leveraging

79
00:05:17,675 --> 00:05:21,298
of strong social links. The negotiation process converts.

80
00:05:21,726 --> 00:05:26,188
their individual selfish motives into the motives that are associated with the collective

81
00:05:26,228 --> 00:05:35,451
goal. Now, it's probably too dark, but that's okay. Like a lot of people within about five

82
00:05:35,491 --> 00:05:40,653
square blocks of this auditorium, I've occasionally been playing Minecraft in the last year.

83
00:05:41,594 --> 00:05:46,316
Mostly I've been playing Minecraft on a multiplayer server maintained by a small group of friends

84
00:05:46,356 --> 00:05:50,317
of mine who are scattered all over the world in different time zones. And what's interesting

85
00:05:50,397 --> 00:05:50,457
is...

86
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,162
We hardly ever actually see each other when we go on this multiplayer server.

87
00:05:55,762 --> 00:06:01,546
We show up, we do our mining, we do our crafting, we construct massive monuments to our personal

88
00:06:01,566 --> 00:06:06,770
hubris, but we don't actually see each other's avatar very often, and we don't even really

89
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:07,590
chat that often.

90
00:06:08,931 --> 00:06:12,874
So interestingly, a couple weeks ago, probably around the same time I was reading that article

91
00:06:13,134 --> 00:06:18,858
on PlayThisThing, I had to sort of take a bit of a hiatus from playing Minecraft.

92
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:21,620
To be honest, it wasn't a hard hiatus to take.

93
00:06:22,858 --> 00:06:27,899
As much as I enjoyed mining and crafting and building extravagant monuments to my hubris,

94
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:32,840
the truth was that, you know, I had a point where I had other things that I needed to

95
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,601
take care of, like creating GDC talks.

96
00:06:35,981 --> 00:06:40,302
But one weekend I decided to fire up the server because I was kind of, I needed a break and

97
00:06:40,322 --> 00:06:44,563
I was curious to see what had been happening in the two weeks since I'd been on there.

98
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:51,085
You see here in this kind of dark image is kind of an elaborate urbanized area with

99
00:06:51,822 --> 00:06:57,746
elevated light rail systems and waterworks and lava pipes and various barricades for

100
00:06:57,766 --> 00:07:02,470
the mutual defense of the inhabitants against marauding mobs. None of that had been there

101
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:09,096
two weeks before. It had been desert and waterfront and mountains. It was like visiting people

102
00:07:09,136 --> 00:07:14,220
in limbo in Inception. All of a sudden there was like these giant cityscapes that had emerged

103
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,444
from nowhere. And I was almost instantly overwhelmed by the need.

104
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,116
to devote the next 48 hours to working on my territory.

105
00:07:24,397 --> 00:07:29,821
I felt this powerful sense that I was not only missing out on all of the cool collective

106
00:07:29,861 --> 00:07:34,564
things that had been going on in the meantime, but that maybe I was actually not holding

107
00:07:34,604 --> 00:07:35,484
up my end of the bargain.

108
00:07:37,065 --> 00:07:41,908
And I think the point here is that players respond very, very powerfully to a sense of

109
00:07:41,968 --> 00:07:44,570
collective agency that's at work in the game space.

110
00:07:46,151 --> 00:07:47,932
It's more powerful and more potent.

111
00:07:48,299 --> 00:07:53,022
than maybe any one individual game motivation that they might experience as a single player.

112
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:59,967
And for scientists who study the psychology of people in games, in games that have multiple

113
00:07:59,987 --> 00:08:02,649
players, this is known as shared intentionality.

114
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:06,852
And it lies at the heart of what we're going to be talking about in terms of cooperation.

115
00:08:08,153 --> 00:08:10,034
So that's fine.

116
00:08:10,414 --> 00:08:11,195
That's Minecraft.

117
00:08:11,715 --> 00:08:16,398
That's eight weirdos playing a game that doesn't actually have victory conditions.

118
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,721
a game that hasn't technically been released yet.

119
00:08:20,161 --> 00:08:25,302
For those of us that are working on kind of these mass-market commercial mainstream games

120
00:08:25,362 --> 00:08:31,644
that have a co-op component, how do we achieve the conditions in which shared intentionality

121
00:08:31,684 --> 00:08:37,025
becomes an important factor in the enjoyment of the players and therefore causes them to

122
00:08:37,105 --> 00:08:39,026
want to work together and to want to cooperate?

123
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:45,468
Now this isn't trivial because by definition if it's an online game, the players are separated

124
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:46,128
geographically.

125
00:08:47,388 --> 00:08:51,990
If, to a large extent, our statistics are correct, and we think they probably are,

126
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,471
probably at least half of them don't even know each other.

127
00:08:54,811 --> 00:08:57,292
They're playing by a matchmaking and various other mechanisms.

128
00:08:58,352 --> 00:09:01,814
Also, let's face it, as game developers, as designers,

129
00:09:02,494 --> 00:09:06,516
we really prize and prioritize individual player agency.

130
00:09:07,076 --> 00:09:08,317
Right? We have huge fights about it.

131
00:09:08,337 --> 00:09:11,238
It's probably the one fight that every single designer has had at some point

132
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,399
with the rest of their team.

133
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:15,420
As we argue that...

134
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:20,004
regardless of what the production realities are, regardless of how polished the scripted

135
00:09:20,044 --> 00:09:25,848
events might look in a particular section, that if we're eroding somehow the agency of

136
00:09:25,888 --> 00:09:30,310
the individual player, if we're taking away from interactivity, that we're fundamentally

137
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,611
degrading the play experience.

138
00:09:31,731 --> 00:09:33,452
And we're actually correct about that.

139
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:39,636
However, sometimes I think we develop myopia because we don't stop to consider that also

140
00:09:39,696 --> 00:09:43,959
multiple players need to be able to have a kind of collective agency and that we need

141
00:09:43,979 --> 00:09:45,720
to support that systemically.

142
00:09:47,055 --> 00:09:51,978
So I'll talk about some lessons that I learned with my team while I was working on the co-op

143
00:09:51,998 --> 00:09:53,299
part of Splinter Cell Conviction.

144
00:09:55,721 --> 00:10:01,205
Well, the first big lesson is that players will work together if they determine that

145
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:06,229
there's a way for them to use that cooperation to optimize the output of the game's systems.

146
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:14,555
To talk about that, I'm going to just refer very, very loosely and very broadly to the

147
00:10:14,575 --> 00:10:16,857
detection model that we used in Splinter Cell.

148
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:19,980
This isn't going to be a technical discussion of this, by the way.

149
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,800
So if you're in the AI business, I apologize.

150
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,480
It's not very deep.

151
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:29,842
So the number one lesson that we obtained from observing our players is that stealth

152
00:10:29,882 --> 00:10:33,723
is a difficult enough thing to achieve in a single player game, but when you have more

153
00:10:33,763 --> 00:10:37,563
than one player running around in the game space, stealth becomes an extremely fragile

154
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:37,983
condition.

155
00:10:38,864 --> 00:10:40,544
Okay, well what do I mean by stealth?

156
00:10:40,684 --> 00:10:41,604
What am I talking about?

157
00:10:44,585 --> 00:10:49,988
Stealth for us is really a condition that we achieve by allowing the player to either

158
00:10:50,188 --> 00:10:55,311
be detected by the AI or not be detected by the AI, and it's all the various actions the

159
00:10:55,331 --> 00:10:57,632
player can take one way or the other in that direction.

160
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:02,214
And to understand how that works, we just need to sort of see that our AI has been kind

161
00:11:02,254 --> 00:11:07,017
of built to be tricked, but also been built to incrementally detect the player.

162
00:11:07,557 --> 00:11:09,158
So there's a number of states that permit this.

163
00:11:09,198 --> 00:11:12,860
We have kind of an idle default state, which is everything that the AI does.

164
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:17,489
between the time that it's instantiated and the time that it's killed or unloaded,

165
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:21,271
whether it's systemic or scripted, it's going about its business.

166
00:11:22,231 --> 00:11:25,673
But if something happens to disturb the AI while it's in that state,

167
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:28,574
then it can move into this kind of perturbed condition

168
00:11:28,614 --> 00:11:32,336
where the behaviors are all about searching for whatever the source of the disturbance was.

169
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:39,020
And if enough disturbances occur, or if the player just simply outright allows themselves to be detected,

170
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,801
then the AI will enter a state where its behaviors...

171
00:11:42,526 --> 00:11:44,287
are those that we would associate with combat,

172
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:45,728
with trying to close with the player,

173
00:11:45,768 --> 00:11:46,769
or trying to kill the player,

174
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,570
or more specifically and accurately,

175
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,031
trying to entertain the player

176
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,672
while looking like it's trying to kill them.

177
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:58,015
And an important point here, again, not technical at all,

178
00:11:58,115 --> 00:12:02,398
is that these transitions that I just described

179
00:12:02,418 --> 00:12:06,020
between states, these are thresholds, basically.

180
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,961
This represents an accumulation of events

181
00:12:08,722 --> 00:12:11,283
that cause the AI to move from one state to another.

182
00:12:12,153 --> 00:12:15,335
And if we look at just even a single player that's operating in the game space, what we

183
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:20,998
see is that it's actually kind of difficult to know exactly how any one little action

184
00:12:21,038 --> 00:12:24,260
or event contributes to those transitions taking place.

185
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:24,981
I mean, you can do it.

186
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,062
You can build a giant list or a log.

187
00:12:27,402 --> 00:12:31,564
You can build a big matrix that shows exactly how one particular action by the player under

188
00:12:31,604 --> 00:12:33,546
certain conditions will cause this to take place.

189
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:35,126
It would just be a lot of work.

190
00:12:37,013 --> 00:12:40,035
If we add a second player to the mix, well, we have to do all that as well.

191
00:12:40,055 --> 00:12:44,296
We have to see how the second player can contribute actions that will cause the second player

192
00:12:44,336 --> 00:12:44,937
to be detected.

193
00:12:45,237 --> 00:12:49,118
But then, very quickly, what we realize is that, actually, it's even worse than that,

194
00:12:49,198 --> 00:12:54,361
because then we have to account for how player one can cause actions that will cause player

195
00:12:54,421 --> 00:12:58,262
two to be detected, and then player two can do things that will cause player one to get

196
00:12:58,282 --> 00:12:58,442
detected.

197
00:12:58,782 --> 00:13:04,325
So you can see, I mean, it turns into a non-linear and highly messy combinatoric.

198
00:13:04,715 --> 00:13:11,741
expression that I wouldn't want to have to draw the matrix for. Bottom line, just because

199
00:13:11,761 --> 00:13:15,804
you have two players in the map doesn't mean you only have twice as much chance of being

200
00:13:15,844 --> 00:13:22,230
detected. In fact, it's possibly a whole lot worse than that. But the flip side is that

201
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:28,475
if the players are behaving intentionally and they are observing the AI and learning

202
00:13:28,495 --> 00:13:31,798
how the AI operates and learning how the detection model works.

203
00:13:32,451 --> 00:13:37,152
they can actually work together to reduce the chances that they're going to be detected substantially.

204
00:13:39,213 --> 00:13:47,296
And the point is here that players are acting with their knowledge and understanding of the game systems,

205
00:13:48,156 --> 00:13:50,697
not because the game has told them that that's what they should be doing,

206
00:13:51,017 --> 00:13:54,218
but because as they study the game and as they play the game,

207
00:13:54,318 --> 00:13:56,739
whether they're playing cooperatively or not to begin with,

208
00:13:57,319 --> 00:13:59,360
they realize that they have a better chance.

209
00:13:59,974 --> 00:14:02,295
of success if they work together under these conditions.

210
00:14:05,316 --> 00:14:11,699
And what's interesting, maybe even paradoxical, is that that power that comes from that knowledge

211
00:14:11,739 --> 00:14:16,701
and understanding of the game systems, that kind of procedural literacy, actually is giving

212
00:14:16,961 --> 00:14:21,183
the individual players more permission to express themselves as individual players.

213
00:14:22,284 --> 00:14:25,325
And this is something that we actually observed when we were doing our play tests and when

214
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,706
we were looking at other games as well.

215
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:28,847
Is that self-expression...

216
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:33,134
becomes a much more interesting and deep and rich thing when there's multiple players around.

217
00:14:33,494 --> 00:14:40,035
At the high level, what we saw was that players working together will do so to develop strategies

218
00:14:41,216 --> 00:14:46,337
in the pursuit of the game's objectives. That at a mid-level, those players will work together

219
00:14:46,597 --> 00:14:52,578
to create planning and to delegate individual low-level tasks in order to support those

220
00:14:52,638 --> 00:14:57,439
plans. And that when they carry out those low-level

221
00:14:57,539 --> 00:14:58,800
actions as individual players.

222
00:14:59,213 --> 00:15:02,774
they're more likely to take risks and to try things that they wouldn't have tried

223
00:15:03,174 --> 00:15:04,795
if they were playing as single-player players.

224
00:15:06,976 --> 00:15:10,037
And that over the course of the entire game, as they are developing this kind of

225
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:13,218
mastery, this kind of literacy in the game systems, their understanding of

226
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:17,040
how the AI works, how the 3D navigation system works, all of these things,

227
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,322
that they are willing, more willing than they are in single-player to explore

228
00:15:21,522 --> 00:15:24,063
optional paths and try alternate play styles,

229
00:15:24,403 --> 00:15:26,964
because they know that they have a reasonable

230
00:15:27,463 --> 00:15:31,945
chance of regrouping with their team and trying another approach if it doesn't work out.

231
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:39,108
And what we find is that if both of these conditions are present, if the players have

232
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:44,911
an understanding that they can use their cooperation to optimize the output of the game systems

233
00:15:45,691 --> 00:15:50,513
and that the game is letting them express themselves as individual players more because

234
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:56,015
of cooperation, then they actually enjoy the game more. In fact, their enjoyment from that

235
00:15:56,442 --> 00:16:02,784
from this, from what I'll call meaningful cooperation, is so good and so high that they're

236
00:16:02,804 --> 00:16:07,325
willing to forgive an awful lot of flaws and an awful lot of lack of polish in the game

237
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:10,886
that would maybe bother them if they were to scrutinize it while playing as solo players.

238
00:16:12,546 --> 00:16:16,707
Okay so I use this term meaningful cooperation. I want to examine meaningful because it's

239
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:22,789
a little bit loaded. But basically what I mean by this is that it's important in terms

240
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:24,129
of their actual success in the game.

241
00:16:24,694 --> 00:16:25,814
It's not just something we're telling them,

242
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:28,355
you ought to do this, because it says co-op on the box.

243
00:16:30,276 --> 00:16:32,197
But also, even though we're not telling them

244
00:16:32,217 --> 00:16:34,117
to jump through hoops, it does matter

245
00:16:34,598 --> 00:16:35,818
in the context of the game systems.

246
00:16:35,838 --> 00:16:38,979
The game systems recognize that they're doing something,

247
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:41,460
in this case cooperating, and it rewards them for it.

248
00:16:43,061 --> 00:16:46,342
Okay, so now we have this idea that we would like to try

249
00:16:46,382 --> 00:16:48,763
to create circumstances for conditions

250
00:16:48,803 --> 00:16:50,623
for meaningful cooperation.

251
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,904
Now we need design tools as designers.

252
00:16:53,544 --> 00:16:59,028
that are going to allow us to support that. We need specific strategies. Now, today I

253
00:16:59,068 --> 00:17:02,931
want to talk about the strategies that are hopefully usable by the largest number of

254
00:17:02,951 --> 00:17:06,894
people. So I want to talk about strategies that don't depend on any one particular aesthetic

255
00:17:06,934 --> 00:17:12,318
wrapper or particular genre. I want to talk about strategies that are hopefully scalable

256
00:17:12,938 --> 00:17:17,341
and are replicable across the whole game that are not dependent on a particular special

257
00:17:17,401 --> 00:17:21,845
case implementation, that are practical in the context of most productions.

258
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:28,393
So I'm going to talk today about what I'll call cooperative dynamics, which essentially

259
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:33,415
just means I'm talking about enabling cooperation through the game's dynamics. Okay. Another

260
00:17:33,455 --> 00:17:37,737
loaded term, dynamics. Actually, it's good that I'm talking on a Thursday because those

261
00:17:37,777 --> 00:17:41,198
of you who've been here for the week will likely have now had several opportunities

262
00:17:41,218 --> 00:17:46,500
to run into this usage of the term, notably Clint's talk from yesterday and if you've

263
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:51,583
attended the game design workshop, you've heard those guys talk about it.

264
00:17:52,765 --> 00:17:55,705
Basically, it's dynamics in the sense that we need it in the MDA model.

265
00:17:56,846 --> 00:18:05,107
And in Mark and Robin and Bob's paper in 2004, they describe it as the runtime behavior of

266
00:18:05,147 --> 00:18:09,948
the mechanics acting on the player's inputs and each other's outputs over time, which

267
00:18:10,028 --> 00:18:14,169
is a way of saying it's what the game does when you're actually playing it.

268
00:18:16,249 --> 00:18:19,430
Dynamics are what is delivering the final player experience.

269
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,410
In this case, it's cooperation.

270
00:18:22,262 --> 00:18:25,143
meaningful hopefully, but cooperation meaningful or otherwise.

271
00:18:26,343 --> 00:18:31,004
And what I'm going to talk about today are seven of the dynamics that we were looking

272
00:18:31,124 --> 00:18:32,264
at on Splinter Cell.

273
00:18:33,744 --> 00:18:39,586
This list I'm not going to pretend is complete, but what I am going to try to do is demonstrate

274
00:18:39,626 --> 00:18:45,247
or claim that all seven of these dynamics, which I'm going to go through, sit on a continuum

275
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:47,687
of what I would call coerciveness.

276
00:18:48,547 --> 00:18:50,828
They run the gamut from the top to the bottom of...

277
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:56,253
dynamics that are highly prescriptive, in the sense that the player can avoid them,

278
00:18:57,313 --> 00:19:02,055
down to those that are entirely voluntary. The player retains control over whether to

279
00:19:02,095 --> 00:19:05,297
participate in them or not. And interesting gameplay emerges out of that.

280
00:19:06,677 --> 00:19:12,880
Okay. So let's look at the first of these. What I'll call gating or tethering. This is

281
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:17,922
probably the one with which the majority of players and the majority of people here are

282
00:19:17,942 --> 00:19:21,964
familiar. It's kind of the most brute force. It essentially is just saying that

283
00:19:22,634 --> 00:19:27,318
no player is allowed to proceed in the game unless all players are allowed to proceed in the game.

284
00:19:28,619 --> 00:19:33,543
And this should be familiar to anybody who's ever run into an invisible wall

285
00:19:33,863 --> 00:19:36,526
because there was a teammate that was straggling behind them,

286
00:19:37,587 --> 00:19:43,132
or has been abruptly teleported forward because a teammate hit a checkpoint in advance of them.

287
00:19:45,354 --> 00:19:50,078
It should be pretty evident that this is a highly prescriptive approach towards keeping players together.

288
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,563
It's either straggler-centric or it's sprinter-centric in the sense of relying on these outliers

289
00:19:56,643 --> 00:19:58,125
to determine whether it works or not.

290
00:19:59,786 --> 00:20:06,470
And most importantly, maybe, is that there are lots of ways to tart this up and make

291
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:09,853
it look like something more and deeper than it actually is.

292
00:20:10,433 --> 00:20:16,037
But even if it is glossed over with a lot of production value, it is just going to be

293
00:20:16,077 --> 00:20:18,518
an invisible wall or an invisible tether mechanically.

294
00:20:19,878 --> 00:20:24,740
Now, that doesn't mean there aren't good implementations of it. In Uncharted 2, if you're playing Gold

295
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:31,883
Rush mode in their co-op, you'll encounter situations where the two teammates need to

296
00:20:31,924 --> 00:20:35,905
work together, for example, to move a burning obstacle out of the way so that they're able

297
00:20:35,925 --> 00:20:41,188
to advance forward. It's a good implementation. It fits the fiction of the game, the kind

298
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:46,771
of action-adventure sort of fiction that's been used there, and it's consistent with

299
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,012
the level of production value that you find elsewhere in the game.

300
00:20:51,198 --> 00:20:57,161
On Splinter Cell, we used, I have to admit, a lot of different gating strategies. Some

301
00:20:57,201 --> 00:21:03,825
of which were, I'd say, heavily realized, and some of which were just straight up gamey

302
00:21:04,126 --> 00:21:09,809
invisible collisions. We had things like exotic doors that needed both players to pry open.

303
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:14,072
But we also had our holding points between different sections of the map where one player

304
00:21:14,112 --> 00:21:16,953
would just simply be forced into an idle position until the second showed.

305
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,001
Okay, the next I'm going to talk about is what I call exotic challenges.

306
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:28,825
And the term exotic in this case means specifically that the normal camera and controls that the

307
00:21:29,045 --> 00:21:33,508
player is using during core gameplay have been altered and substituted with something

308
00:21:33,648 --> 00:21:33,808
else.

309
00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:39,752
A unique perspective and a unique set of controls that are for different types of gameplay.

310
00:21:41,373 --> 00:21:46,015
And what's interesting about this is that it creates the condition in which the player

311
00:21:46,095 --> 00:21:48,977
who is required to use these different controls.

312
00:21:49,595 --> 00:21:52,036
is still susceptible to all the same kinds of threats

313
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:54,737
and all the same kinds of defeats

314
00:21:55,237 --> 00:21:59,099
that he'd be confronted by when he has his core gameplay controls.

315
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,121
So, it's moderately coercive

316
00:22:03,001 --> 00:22:05,402
in the sense that it's not a binary threat.

317
00:22:05,462 --> 00:22:08,604
It's not something that is immediately going to snap and then it's kicked into effect

318
00:22:08,664 --> 00:22:09,724
and now you're unable to proceed.

319
00:22:10,885 --> 00:22:14,566
What it means is that the risks associated with the player playing by

320
00:22:14,606 --> 00:22:15,107
themselves

321
00:22:16,487 --> 00:22:17,788
grow sharply over time.

322
00:22:19,525 --> 00:22:24,347
and that furthermore, you need more than one player to avert trouble in order to survive

323
00:22:24,947 --> 00:22:28,949
because there are other players who've retained the core gameplay controls and are therefore

324
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:35,813
able to support you. So, classic example of this is the sort of wizard performing astral

325
00:22:35,853 --> 00:22:41,375
projection while the muscly fighter guy, you know, hangs out and keeps track of his lifeless

326
00:22:41,415 --> 00:22:46,838
body. The modern warfare equivalent to that is I equip my laptop in order to control the

327
00:22:46,878 --> 00:22:47,538
predator drone.

328
00:22:47,922 --> 00:22:52,603
while my friends continue to use their tactical movement and shooter mechanics in order to

329
00:22:52,643 --> 00:22:53,064
protect me.

330
00:22:53,964 --> 00:22:57,345
What's interesting is actually in the case of Modern Warfare 2 and the spec ops levels

331
00:22:57,385 --> 00:23:00,085
that they have is the flip side's also true, right?

332
00:23:00,306 --> 00:23:05,707
I could be in an AC-130 gunship and I'm actually the one helping to avert trouble for my friend

333
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:08,708
on the ground who's using the core gameplay mechanics.

334
00:23:09,248 --> 00:23:14,049
He's outnumbered, he's fleeing a larger force and I'm firing shells in order to help protect

335
00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:15,930
him and cover him and play, run interference.

336
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,813
On Conviction, we had a few different exotic gameplay moments.

337
00:23:21,473 --> 00:23:26,778
Probably the best realized was the wireless hacking sequences where one teammate would

338
00:23:26,818 --> 00:23:31,001
need to go up to a particular computer, interact with it, and then had to remain within a certain

339
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:35,785
radius of that object in order to be able to maintain the signal strength to download

340
00:23:35,845 --> 00:23:39,568
the secret data, which meant that they were constrained.

341
00:23:39,588 --> 00:23:43,231
They still had access to a lot of their core gameplay, but they couldn't move away from

342
00:23:43,271 --> 00:23:46,094
that point or it would interrupt the download.

343
00:23:47,623 --> 00:23:51,386
who retained free movement would have to run interference, move around, try to protect

344
00:23:51,466 --> 00:23:55,469
the two of them against the inevitable horde of security forces that were responding to

345
00:23:55,509 --> 00:24:00,513
the hack. So the next two systems I'm going to talk

346
00:24:00,533 --> 00:24:06,597
about are kind of two sides of the same coin. In the case of punitive systems, what we're

347
00:24:06,637 --> 00:24:12,222
saying is that really, one player is trapped. One player is trapped and another player needs

348
00:24:12,262 --> 00:24:14,363
to come to their rescue or it's game over for them.

349
00:24:16,533 --> 00:24:18,914
I think the obvious thing about this is just that it requires

350
00:24:19,534 --> 00:24:22,175
rescue by another player in order for the first player to survive.

351
00:24:23,215 --> 00:24:25,976
The less obvious thing is that it actually represents

352
00:24:26,317 --> 00:24:29,198
punishment and negative feedback to everyone involved,

353
00:24:29,858 --> 00:24:31,198
not just the player who's been trapped.

354
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:33,819
The player who's been trapped is being punished because he was careless

355
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,920
and wasn't paying attention and wandered away from the group,

356
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,261
all the usual things you would expect.

357
00:24:37,921 --> 00:24:41,682
The other players are being punished because they let the player wander away,

358
00:24:41,702 --> 00:24:44,283
but also they're punished if they don't respond in time

359
00:24:44,323 --> 00:24:45,924
and don't take the necessary action to.

360
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:52,082
to recover the situation. But the less obvious thing is that it's not a particularly coercive

361
00:24:52,303 --> 00:24:58,425
mechanic because it can be avoided. If you're smart and if you've mastered the game, you're

362
00:24:58,465 --> 00:25:03,246
able to recognize that the dangers are there and you're able to get away from them. Probably

363
00:25:03,267 --> 00:25:06,748
the best implementation of this that we've seen in recent years would be in the Left

364
00:25:06,768 --> 00:25:11,069
for Dead series with the smoker. I think the smoker is perfectly balanced in the sense

365
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:15,451
that the signs and feedback associated with it, the distinct sound that accompanies it.

366
00:25:15,778 --> 00:25:20,380
the smoker appearing on the scene sort of sets the entire party on edge. They quickly

367
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,182
look at each other to make sure they know where each other are. They quickly scan the

368
00:25:23,202 --> 00:25:28,345
rooftops to make sure that they can see where the smoker is. And maybe kind of disgustingly,

369
00:25:28,845 --> 00:25:33,728
the smoker's tongue is like the perfect progress bar, right? It's like the ultimate organic

370
00:25:33,808 --> 00:25:38,491
timer as it drags you to your doom. Everybody can see exactly how much time they have left

371
00:25:38,691 --> 00:25:43,613
in order to try to save you. We had a couple of punitive systems in.

372
00:25:44,815 --> 00:25:49,377
Splinter Cell Conviction co-op. We had the usual one that you associate with these kinds

373
00:25:49,397 --> 00:25:53,458
of games where one teammate has been wounded, is going to bleed to death unless the other

374
00:25:53,478 --> 00:25:58,379
teammate comes and rescues them. But we had an additional one which is at higher levels

375
00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:04,461
we started to encounter enemies that were capable of grabbing an unwary player and holding

376
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:08,842
them in a choke hold at which point they would start to asphyxiate. And then the second player

377
00:26:08,862 --> 00:26:12,263
would need to run to their aid and the first player could throw the elbow and duck down

378
00:26:12,303 --> 00:26:13,623
and create the window of opportunity.

379
00:26:14,064 --> 00:26:17,806
What's interesting is that these two systems actually ended up working together in a really

380
00:26:18,126 --> 00:26:21,307
surprising and delightful way, which I'm going to talk about a little bit later.

381
00:26:23,968 --> 00:26:27,890
The flip side to those would be buffing systems. Buffing systems are pretty familiar. It's

382
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:34,032
just the idea that one player is mechanically making another player more powerful. And as

383
00:26:34,072 --> 00:26:38,874
they are doing that, it's creating this kind of back and forth movement between the team

384
00:26:38,914 --> 00:26:40,355
being sort of unbalanced in a way.

385
00:26:41,438 --> 00:26:45,960
the buffer is probably rendered vulnerable by this and the buffy becomes very overpowered.

386
00:26:47,641 --> 00:26:50,542
One thing that's interesting is that it can be implemented in a way that's either passive

387
00:26:50,562 --> 00:26:53,563
or intentional. Passive in the sense that as long as you stay close to me, you'll be

388
00:26:54,023 --> 00:26:58,525
tougher or less visible. Or it can be intentional in that I actually have to target my teammate.

389
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:04,027
The benefits are almost always conditional and usually temporary in order to avoid a

390
00:27:04,447 --> 00:27:10,250
permanent unbalance. And it's entirely voluntary. Players can opt in or not opt in to this.

391
00:27:12,636 --> 00:27:16,517
An interesting approach to this on a game that's nominally pretty realistic would be

392
00:27:16,557 --> 00:27:21,919
in the Army of Two series, the aggro system, which literally allows one player to buff

393
00:27:22,419 --> 00:27:26,820
the stealthiness and the invisibility of his teammate just by standing up and making a

394
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:31,182
bigger target of themselves. And this is a system that's actually grafted above and beyond

395
00:27:31,262 --> 00:27:36,023
the normal behavior of the AI, accompanied by a bunch of signs and feedback in the HUD

396
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:41,124
and in the game. Now, we had a buffing system in Splinter Cell

397
00:27:41,144 --> 00:27:41,805
Conviction Co-op.

398
00:27:42,664 --> 00:27:44,425
And people definitely used it.

399
00:27:45,585 --> 00:27:47,726
However, if we're being honest with ourselves, we probably

400
00:27:47,746 --> 00:27:50,387
have to admit that a lot of them didn't realize that they

401
00:27:50,427 --> 00:27:51,027
were using it.

402
00:27:52,288 --> 00:27:54,209
We had the mark and execute system, which was developed

403
00:27:54,229 --> 00:27:57,230
for single player, which enabled the player to pre-mark

404
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:00,631
targets and then, under certain conditions, take them

405
00:28:00,651 --> 00:28:03,592
all out in one attack to sort of enforce that idea that

406
00:28:03,612 --> 00:28:06,253
you're the elite spy who's a crack shot and you're able to

407
00:28:06,293 --> 00:28:06,574
do this.

408
00:28:07,814 --> 00:28:10,655
In co-op, what we allowed players to do was jump in on

409
00:28:10,695 --> 00:28:12,396
each other's executes if they shared.

410
00:28:12,803 --> 00:28:16,986
line of sight on any targets, but also if any other marks were available nearby, so

411
00:28:17,006 --> 00:28:22,230
that we could essentially extend and boost the range of the area of effect of the mark

412
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:27,414
and execute. And it was a great system, and people definitely were using it, but when

413
00:28:27,494 --> 00:28:30,677
quizzed about it afterwards, a lot of them weren't even aware that they were using it.

414
00:28:30,777 --> 00:28:37,822
So, fail. Asymmetric abilities are, I think, a pretty straightforward notion to people

415
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:42,005
who played, for example, rock band style games, games that are supporting.

416
00:28:43,158 --> 00:28:47,201
different sets of abilities for the characters, and we're talking specifically about the characters

417
00:28:47,701 --> 00:28:53,245
in this case. The idea being that the group is constantly moving back and forth between

418
00:28:53,285 --> 00:28:58,329
conditions of being sort of overwhelmed by the challenges of the game or overpowered

419
00:28:58,609 --> 00:29:02,672
just as they sort of reconfigure themselves to tackle those challenges in the right way.

420
00:29:03,612 --> 00:29:08,896
It could be an entirely built out orthogonal class system like you might see in an RPG

421
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:09,116
game.

422
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:13,904
Or it could be the consequence of a customization system, players spending experience points

423
00:29:13,944 --> 00:29:16,826
in order to specialize, in order to give themselves unique abilities.

424
00:29:17,646 --> 00:29:22,951
But the one common assumption here is that no one player is going to be able to max out

425
00:29:23,451 --> 00:29:24,752
everything, right?

426
00:29:26,273 --> 00:29:28,295
They can't just turn themselves into a super generalist.

427
00:29:28,835 --> 00:29:33,179
But what's interesting is that players are still free to progress with their own limited

428
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:35,380
subset of those character abilities.

429
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:38,583
They can try it, and in some cases they can succeed at it.

430
00:29:39,102 --> 00:29:42,563
It's just that all of those complementary advantages and disadvantages tend to lend

431
00:29:42,603 --> 00:29:47,005
themselves in a fairly obvious way to the players to working together for mutual support.

432
00:29:48,985 --> 00:29:52,847
Borderlands is a game recently that I think has done a very good job of this because at

433
00:29:52,867 --> 00:29:56,108
the start of the game, while we have different stats, the different characters have different

434
00:29:56,148 --> 00:30:00,790
stats, nevertheless they do share a kind of core set of mechanics that they can kind of

435
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:01,870
learn to use at the same time.

436
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:03,791
And after about an hour of leveling up.

437
00:30:04,228 --> 00:30:08,370
they are able to unlock their unique abilities and then become very powerfully motivated

438
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:11,711
to explore those unique abilities even while they've retained their understanding of the

439
00:30:11,751 --> 00:30:12,292
core systems.

440
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:18,374
The fact of the matter is that on Splinter Cell Conviction, we didn't explore this particular

441
00:30:18,414 --> 00:30:19,214
dynamic very much.

442
00:30:20,075 --> 00:30:23,356
The both of the players, in spite of the fact that one of them is supposed to be an American

443
00:30:23,396 --> 00:30:27,578
Splinter Cell, the other one is supposed to be a Russian Voron agent, have identical abilities,

444
00:30:27,978 --> 00:30:32,580
identical movesets, they use the same animation, the same fighting ability, they just look

445
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,960
different and sound different when they talk.

446
00:30:35,282 --> 00:30:41,203
So the onus was entirely on the player to use the PEC challenge points in order to customize

447
00:30:41,223 --> 00:30:45,124
their weapons loadouts to give themselves either armor or more weapon ammo capacity

448
00:30:45,164 --> 00:30:49,924
or gadget capacity. And the sad reality is that most players didn't explore that system

449
00:30:49,964 --> 00:30:50,545
very much at all.

450
00:30:54,945 --> 00:31:00,787
So next is combined actions. Now, combined actions on first blush is going to sound a

451
00:31:00,827 --> 00:31:03,987
little bit like asymmetric abilities. It's the notion that there are different...

452
00:31:04,455 --> 00:31:10,897
player skills that are implicated in the gameplay and that players need to understand that no

453
00:31:11,037 --> 00:31:16,039
one player is going to be able to tackle those challenges by themselves, or at least it's

454
00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:17,639
going to be very, very difficult for them to do it.

455
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:26,362
And the key here is just that players are able to recognize the nature of the challenge,

456
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:31,203
break it down into its individual component challenges, and then divvy up.

457
00:31:31,621 --> 00:31:36,043
or delegate those roles between them, at which point it becomes almost a formality. Now,

458
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:41,626
this hinges on an idea. It's pretty simple, but it does merit some explanation. So the

459
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:47,649
notion that any game challenge that we describe can be defined by the specific player skills,

460
00:31:47,749 --> 00:31:52,572
not the character abilities, but the player skills that are required in order to overcome

461
00:31:52,592 --> 00:31:59,995
it. Now, here's a list of player skills, precision, timing, measurement in the sort of analog

462
00:32:00,216 --> 00:32:00,756
input sense.

463
00:32:01,527 --> 00:32:05,327
resource management, tactical choices, strategic choices, puzzle play.

464
00:32:06,487 --> 00:32:10,428
This might be a complete list, but I'm not going to stand up here and debate whether

465
00:32:10,468 --> 00:32:13,729
it should be like eight more things or five fewer things or whatever.

466
00:32:13,749 --> 00:32:17,309
I mean, the point is that if we accept the notion that there are skills and that the

467
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:23,150
skills are implicated by discrete gameplay challenges, then it's possible for us as designers

468
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:27,751
to ensure that the tempo of those challenges is just always beyond the comfort zone of

469
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:28,391
any one player.

470
00:32:29,331 --> 00:32:30,792
At which point, it's up to the players.

471
00:32:31,358 --> 00:32:33,560
to identify what those compound challenges are,

472
00:32:34,041 --> 00:32:36,162
agree amongst themselves as to who's going to take on what,

473
00:32:36,643 --> 00:32:38,664
and then at that point, it becomes a rather enjoyable

474
00:32:39,085 --> 00:32:40,186
process of overcoming it.

475
00:32:41,607 --> 00:32:44,189
Red Dead Redemption and the Outlast to the End co-op

476
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,191
does a very good job of this, actually.

477
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:51,014
The specific example I'll use of I'm driving the horse-drawn

478
00:32:51,655 --> 00:32:55,038
stagecoach, so I'm having to engage in precision and timing

479
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:56,379
in terms of controlling the horses,

480
00:32:56,879 --> 00:32:59,021
a certain amount of analog measurement in terms of my speed.

481
00:32:59,472 --> 00:33:03,575
at the same time that my buddy who's riding shotgun is having to use precision to line

482
00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:07,779
up targets with the crosshairs, is having to make tactical choices about which of the

483
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:12,102
bandits to shoot in which order. This is almost a classic example of how combined actions

484
00:33:12,122 --> 00:33:19,728
would work in order to help promote cooperation. In Splinter Cell, I mean, we call ourselves

485
00:33:19,848 --> 00:33:24,351
a stealth action game, and in co-op it was a mandate on the level design side to try

486
00:33:24,391 --> 00:33:26,153
to support multiple styles of play.

487
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:30,351
players being able to use action, being able to use stealth, being able to use gadgets

488
00:33:30,391 --> 00:33:34,112
in order to make their way through it. The reality is that an awful lot of the skills

489
00:33:34,172 --> 00:33:38,912
associated with those different styles of play are the same skills. They differ maybe

490
00:33:39,152 --> 00:33:42,853
by one or two skills in a couple different areas. But we didn't really fully explore

491
00:33:42,873 --> 00:33:45,734
or take advantage of this approach. But it's definitely something that we could.

492
00:33:48,914 --> 00:33:52,455
The last dynamic I'm going to talk about is one that I think is probably familiar to people

493
00:33:52,515 --> 00:33:55,475
who have played a lot of the bullet hell style shooter games.

494
00:33:56,071 --> 00:34:02,273
its notion of survival and attrition. And as a dynamic, it really is a kind of oscillation

495
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:08,376
in terms of player motive. So it's almost at the level of metagame. It's the notion

496
00:34:08,436 --> 00:34:15,118
that play can continue for as long as there is at least one player alive, which is essentially

497
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:18,280
saying you can be a hero, but you can also be dead.

498
00:34:22,034 --> 00:34:25,977
many players are possible, or many survivors are possible. In fact, all the players could

499
00:34:26,017 --> 00:34:30,821
survive until the very, very end. But if you die, you're out for the round. You're going

500
00:34:30,841 --> 00:34:34,784
to be waiting for however long the round lasts until your friends are done and you get to

501
00:34:34,824 --> 00:34:41,870
listen to them laughing and screaming and yelling and enjoying themselves. What's interesting

502
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:47,314
about this dynamic is that it makes survival itself a kind of victory. It just makes it

503
00:34:47,334 --> 00:34:49,756
kind of a slightly lower tier victory.

504
00:34:51,108 --> 00:34:54,448
At the end of the day, there can really only be one most valuable player.

505
00:34:56,069 --> 00:35:02,390
And that pressure to say, well, I've survived the last few levels, I'd really like to be

506
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:07,231
the hero, I'd like to be the MVP, means that players will, over time, tend to stick their

507
00:35:07,251 --> 00:35:07,551
neck out.

508
00:35:08,531 --> 00:35:10,892
They'll weigh the risks and the rewards and they'll give it a shot.

509
00:35:11,392 --> 00:35:15,192
And some of them will do it, and they'll be the hero, and some of them will die, and then

510
00:35:15,232 --> 00:35:17,413
the next round they'll probably play a bit more conservatively.

511
00:35:19,493 --> 00:35:20,933
This particular dynamic lens itself.

512
00:35:21,434 --> 00:35:27,515
really, really well to sort of the squad military style game, because that whole aesthetic,

513
00:35:27,555 --> 00:35:31,516
the whole conceit of we're a military unit, we have certain mission objectives we need

514
00:35:31,536 --> 00:35:36,397
to achieve, but at the same time, you know, we have to keep the squad alive, we leave

515
00:35:36,417 --> 00:35:41,458
no man behind, this kind of concept works very well with this dynamic. And the recent

516
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:45,939
Ghost Recon games, Grawl 1 and Grawl 2, did a very good job of leveraging this approach.

517
00:35:48,335 --> 00:35:52,818
Now, I can say with absolute certainty, we did not use this dynamic in Splinter Cell

518
00:35:52,838 --> 00:35:57,382
Conviction co-op at all. Because in Splinter Cell Conviction, when one player dies, it's

519
00:35:57,402 --> 00:36:02,166
game over for both sides. Now in our case, I think it was the right choice, because it

520
00:36:02,246 --> 00:36:09,672
fit the fantasy of the two covert agents placed in harm's way, unable to be able to complete

521
00:36:09,692 --> 00:36:13,956
the mission unless both players are able to do it. So it fit, and it wouldn't necessarily

522
00:36:13,976 --> 00:36:16,698
have made sense for us. Although, something we would explore.

523
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:24,823
Okay, so those are the seven dynamics. And I'm going to just go through some of the lessons

524
00:36:24,843 --> 00:36:29,366
that we learned on conviction as a result of seeing how these things worked in practice.

525
00:36:30,767 --> 00:36:37,050
The first thing that we found is that more players in co-op were tending to use the mark

526
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:42,694
and execute system intentionally than they were in single player. Why? Because we let

527
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:47,877
them share marks. We let the players mark individual targets on their own.

528
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:51,440
and then we let either of the players execute on those marks.

529
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,721
Now initially, players would mark targets because it was a great way to communicate

530
00:36:55,761 --> 00:36:58,801
with each other. It was a great way to say, oh, hey, there's a guy over there. He just

531
00:36:58,821 --> 00:37:03,902
walked around that, oh, there, okay, there he is. And then that created an opportunity

532
00:37:04,642 --> 00:37:08,083
as players were earning execute tokens for each other by taking enemies out hand to hand

533
00:37:09,483 --> 00:37:12,704
for the players to use, mark, and execute in exactly the way we designed it.

534
00:37:16,105 --> 00:37:18,185
Next, and this gets back to what I started to mention before.

535
00:37:19,198 --> 00:37:24,141
we got real drama, like real, the sort of true archetypal water cooler moment

536
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:27,063
out of the interaction between our punitive systems.

537
00:37:27,904 --> 00:37:31,926
Because it was possible for a player to be wounded

538
00:37:32,666 --> 00:37:34,788
and to be immobilized on the ground bleeding to death,

539
00:37:35,808 --> 00:37:38,450
to have their teammate come rushing to their rescue,

540
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:42,012
and to be within steps of reaching them

541
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:45,093
and then get grabbed by another enemy in a chokehold.

542
00:37:45,834 --> 00:37:48,155
At which point, the player on the ground...

543
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:50,279
was able to draw a sidearm.

544
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,860
They could scream at each other over their mics,

545
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,640
duck, duck now, duck.

546
00:37:55,341 --> 00:37:57,021
And the guy would duck and say, take the shot,

547
00:37:57,141 --> 00:37:58,241
take the shot, exactly like we've

548
00:37:58,261 --> 00:37:59,802
seen in every movie 100 times over.

549
00:38:00,962 --> 00:38:03,963
Pop them in a headshot with both of their health bars

550
00:38:04,183 --> 00:38:05,643
shrinking as the whole thing's going on.

551
00:38:06,103 --> 00:38:09,144
And then the freed teammate would race to his friend's aid

552
00:38:09,164 --> 00:38:10,464
and rescue him at the last second.

553
00:38:11,584 --> 00:38:14,245
We knew it was possible when we were designing the system,

554
00:38:14,585 --> 00:38:17,166
but we thought, eh, it's probably kind of an edge case.

555
00:38:17,226 --> 00:38:18,566
We'll be lucky if we see it once in a while.

556
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:20,479
Happened in our first playtest.

557
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:26,402
It was honestly probably the most ecstatic moment I've ever had as a game designer.

558
00:38:27,823 --> 00:38:31,165
And here we had these players who up until that point had been playing a pretty, to be

559
00:38:31,185 --> 00:38:33,166
blunt, shitty, mediocre build of a game.

560
00:38:34,787 --> 00:38:37,268
Struggling with all the different problems that we were having with the controls at that

561
00:38:37,288 --> 00:38:37,548
moment.

562
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:40,350
Didn't know each other, because they were just guys we pulled into the playtest.

563
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:43,892
Suddenly they're like high-fiving each other, and, you know, they're best friends.

564
00:38:43,912 --> 00:38:45,333
It's good stuff.

565
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:57,056
The fact is, while they were useful and they helped us to, in a very pre-planned way, author

566
00:38:57,156 --> 00:39:03,481
moments that fit the spy fantasy, the fact is, exotic gameplay moments and exotic challenges

567
00:39:04,461 --> 00:39:08,765
did have the effect of exposing limits on the interactivity of the player.

568
00:39:09,705 --> 00:39:12,067
Because up till that point, the players using core gameplay mechanics.

569
00:39:13,236 --> 00:39:16,698
is in the groove, is developing a kind of familiarity, that kind of literacy that we

570
00:39:16,718 --> 00:39:20,360
talked about, the ability to optimize the outputs of the game, the ability to cooperate

571
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,982
with each other and communicate with each other, and then all of a sudden we're imposing

572
00:39:24,042 --> 00:39:29,085
a very specific constraint on their action. It's still a tool, it's still a useful tool,

573
00:39:29,385 --> 00:39:35,829
but we need to be aware of the fact that it's a big sort of screech in the flow of social

574
00:39:35,869 --> 00:39:37,390
interaction in the course of the co-op game.

575
00:39:40,952 --> 00:39:44,693
Something that we realized, and this wasn't really a big surprise, because it's also true

576
00:39:44,733 --> 00:39:49,376
in single-player games to a large extent, is that high-level plot is never going to

577
00:39:49,396 --> 00:39:54,818
be as important as the kind of low-level interactions that we support between characters, and in

578
00:39:54,879 --> 00:39:55,939
our case, between players.

579
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,641
In our case, we were able to exploit that.

580
00:40:00,581 --> 00:40:07,165
We built a lot of the dialogue between our two-player characters around systemic output.

581
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:09,726
So in other words, when certain kinds of gameplay...

582
00:40:10,418 --> 00:40:14,400
outputs would occur. The two characters would acknowledge it, they would share a bit of

583
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,401
dialogue, and we allowed the nature of that dialogue to evolve over the course of the

584
00:40:18,441 --> 00:40:23,322
whole game. So that these two characters who, in the plot, aren't supposed to like each

585
00:40:23,362 --> 00:40:26,323
other at the beginning of the game, are kind of slowly beginning to respect each other.

586
00:40:26,343 --> 00:40:32,585
And this is reflected in their systemic barks in their gameplay dialogue. Players appreciated

587
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:36,786
this. In fact, it's the only thing they talked about when it came to story.

588
00:40:37,533 --> 00:40:41,055
when we read the forums. They'd long since forgotten what the plot was, something about

589
00:40:41,115 --> 00:40:47,859
EMPs and Russia and mobsters and things. But they talked a lot about Archer and Kestrel

590
00:40:47,899 --> 00:40:50,860
and the fact that these guys didn't really like each other, but they seemed like they

591
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,341
were buddies and then, well, I'm not going to spoil the ending.

592
00:40:56,263 --> 00:41:03,867
So just to kind of go over some generalized best practices in order to wrap up, I think

593
00:41:04,267 --> 00:41:06,288
the first thing is, if you don't have to...

594
00:41:07,436 --> 00:41:10,699
Try not to pour production values into highly prescriptive systems.

595
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,241
Alright? You're not fooling your players.

596
00:41:14,502 --> 00:41:17,625
If you stick an invisible collision or a glowing wall or whatever it is,

597
00:41:18,165 --> 00:41:20,568
your players will understand what it is.

598
00:41:20,668 --> 00:41:24,171
They'll realize what you've done and they'll understand that you had a reason for doing it.

599
00:41:24,311 --> 00:41:26,993
They might not like it, but they'll move on.

600
00:41:28,615 --> 00:41:33,679
If you attempt to make it look as though everything is normal and okay,

601
00:41:34,389 --> 00:41:38,511
then they are going to bump into that collision in a more painful way because they will be

602
00:41:38,571 --> 00:41:43,374
trying to use their collective agency. They'll be talking to each other. Wait, no, maybe

603
00:41:43,394 --> 00:41:45,915
we need to go around to the left. Okay, you try going to the right. Okay, see if you hit

604
00:41:45,935 --> 00:41:51,259
that. Okay. No, actually, no, you're just not allowed to do that. So better to go the

605
00:41:51,299 --> 00:41:56,201
gamey route and embrace it and have them deal with it than to try to convince them something

606
00:41:56,241 --> 00:42:03,726
else is happening. Whether or not you agree with any of the dynamics that I've described,

607
00:42:04,386 --> 00:42:08,389
just please, my appeal to you is give the players tools for mutual support. You can

608
00:42:08,429 --> 00:42:11,711
find your own language for it. You can find your own way of doing it. But that's really

609
00:42:11,751 --> 00:42:19,097
the key here. This is what matters. Recognize that when you have more than one player in

610
00:42:19,117 --> 00:42:24,361
the environment, that generates noise. It generates all kinds of noise. It generates

611
00:42:24,421 --> 00:42:31,326
the actual noise of multiple players' characters moving around in the game space. So the sensory

612
00:42:31,366 --> 00:42:33,427
noise. It generates a system's noise.

613
00:42:34,126 --> 00:42:37,467
of multiple players perturbing the system, the AI, and all these other things in lots

614
00:42:37,508 --> 00:42:42,410
of different ways that make the environment more chaotic. And you have the social noise

615
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:46,391
of these two people who might be sitting on a couch or might be talking over their microphones

616
00:42:47,372 --> 00:42:53,395
distracting each other. So when you're designing the ingredients at the level of kind of aesthetic

617
00:42:53,435 --> 00:42:59,377
level of level design, focus on readability, on the legibility of those ingredients first,

618
00:42:59,918 --> 00:43:03,279
then make it pretty. To give you a good example of this.

619
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:10,422
on conviction in the single-player maps, which were beautiful. Lighting was initially done

620
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:16,203
as a kind of an art pass. Basically, the lighting fit the logic, the architecture, the intentions,

621
00:43:16,263 --> 00:43:21,865
the mood of those maps, and it was beautiful. And once it was beautiful, then after multiple

622
00:43:21,905 --> 00:43:25,746
iterations, looking at heat map results, all this other stuff, the team was able to go

623
00:43:25,866 --> 00:43:30,888
in and tweak and adjust the lighting to work well with the AI's detection model. In the

624
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:31,628
case of co-op...

625
00:43:32,065 --> 00:43:34,646
we had to do it 180 degrees in the opposite direction.

626
00:43:35,826 --> 00:43:39,067
We built, our lighting was giant circles of light,

627
00:43:39,147 --> 00:43:40,747
like you'd see in a Bugs Bunny cartoon.

628
00:43:41,447 --> 00:43:43,088
And we would sort of string these circles of light

629
00:43:43,108 --> 00:43:44,148
to create our shadow paths.

630
00:43:44,168 --> 00:43:47,069
And once we knew that we had enough of a shadow path

631
00:43:47,109 --> 00:43:48,409
to accommodate more than one player,

632
00:43:49,309 --> 00:43:51,570
then we'd do a pass to try to substitute

633
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:52,650
those light sources with something

634
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:54,010
maybe it felt a little more logical.

635
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:56,851
And then we would go through and do these iterative passes

636
00:43:56,891 --> 00:43:58,311
to make it more discreet and more subtle,

637
00:43:58,891 --> 00:44:00,032
and have it look a little bit nicer.

638
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:03,332
And the message there is, players will forgive that.

639
00:44:03,652 --> 00:44:05,173
Even if they were to do a side-by-side comparison

640
00:44:05,193 --> 00:44:06,994
and go, woo, geez, man, co-op lighting

641
00:44:07,014 --> 00:44:07,894
looks a little old school.

642
00:44:08,474 --> 00:44:08,855
It's OK.

643
00:44:09,995 --> 00:44:11,816
They're more interested in having the ability

644
00:44:11,856 --> 00:44:13,317
to do what they want to do than they are

645
00:44:13,357 --> 00:44:16,178
in whether the lighting pass was done exactly the same way

646
00:44:16,218 --> 00:44:17,359
between single player and co-op.

647
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:23,222
Finally, and this is sort of the high level takeaway, I guess,

648
00:44:23,342 --> 00:44:27,745
is you need to trust that your players will find a way.

649
00:44:28,593 --> 00:44:31,936
they will, if you let them work together and if you give them a good reason to,

650
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:36,359
they will find interesting solutions to the gameplay challenges that you present them with

651
00:44:36,379 --> 00:44:38,280
that maybe you wouldn't have anticipated.

652
00:44:39,001 --> 00:44:41,742
So, after everything else I've said, at the same time,

653
00:44:42,303 --> 00:44:45,625
don't freak out, don't feel like you need to control the player experience

654
00:44:45,645 --> 00:44:47,686
for these two people or three people or four people.

655
00:44:48,807 --> 00:44:52,450
Their numbers will give them the added collective intelligence to tackle these problems.

656
00:44:55,296 --> 00:44:57,497
Now there's some things that I think would merit further investigation.

657
00:44:57,517 --> 00:44:58,918
They're outside of the scope of this talk.

658
00:44:59,438 --> 00:45:03,720
They were almost within the scope of this talk until I realized that it would be a two-hour-long talk.

659
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:11,083
I think we've talked about dynamic solutions that are meant to be relatively accessible to lots of different types of games,

660
00:45:11,503 --> 00:45:17,326
but it would be an interesting discussion to see how specific aesthetic directions,

661
00:45:17,346 --> 00:45:21,808
specific level design solutions could also help make a particular game type.

662
00:45:22,733 --> 00:45:25,855
more conducive to mutual cooperation and meaningful cooperation.

663
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:34,639
There's an entire discussion about how we can use presentation design. In other words,

664
00:45:35,139 --> 00:45:40,382
the HUD system, cues and prompts and visual signs and feedback inside the game environment

665
00:45:40,662 --> 00:45:45,304
in order to give players a stronger sense as to situations where they can cooperate

666
00:45:45,684 --> 00:45:47,385
or where cooperation might be a good idea.

667
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:58,185
And then I think there's an entire talk or two on the subject of tools for communication

668
00:45:58,265 --> 00:46:02,529
and coordination, which is really communication coordination being something entirely distinct

669
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:08,434
from just straight collaborative working together to solve problems, but it feeds into this

670
00:46:08,494 --> 00:46:11,997
and there's so many dependencies here that there would be an entire discussion on it.

671
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:16,321
So these are all topics that I encourage any of you who are involved in the development

672
00:46:16,341 --> 00:46:17,222
of co-op games to think about.

673
00:46:17,881 --> 00:46:22,263
and maybe offer suggestions on, but it's a GDC talk for at least a few people in this

674
00:46:22,303 --> 00:46:27,285
room if you want to give it a shot. And that's where I'll end it. So I'll start taking questions.

675
00:46:36,468 --> 00:46:37,869
We have two mics. There you go.

676
00:46:49,269 --> 00:46:56,152
in the neighborhoods and taking care of the lawns nice.

677
00:46:56,192 --> 00:46:58,514
But at some point, they get competitive about this.

678
00:46:58,534 --> 00:46:59,354
Like, mobile is a big part of the solution.

679
00:46:59,374 --> 00:47:00,455
Is there a role for cooperating or competitiveness

680
00:47:00,475 --> 00:47:09,499
with the agent cooperation in terms of ways of thinking about

681
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:10,019
these other platforms.

682
00:47:10,039 --> 00:47:12,100
Will you ever have a meeting?

683
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,081
Um, yes, absolutely.

684
00:47:14,101 --> 00:47:15,382
The, the...

685
00:47:17,141 --> 00:47:23,766
It's funny you say that. So, coopetition, which is the horrible portmanteau that we use for this,

686
00:47:24,266 --> 00:47:29,310
is absolutely, has a role in probably the majority of cooperative games.

687
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:32,973
Because at some point, when you reach that level of mastery,

688
00:47:33,473 --> 00:47:38,357
where there's so much shorthand and these strong social links are allowing players to use shared intentionality,

689
00:47:38,377 --> 00:47:40,979
and na-na-na-na-na-na-na, you start to want more.

690
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,963
And what's fascinating about that is, we can either, again, throw that entirely

691
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:52,882
to the player's discretion and just try to seed the world and seed the game system space

692
00:47:52,962 --> 00:47:58,586
with lots of opportunities for one player to kind of elbow aside his fellow citizens

693
00:47:58,686 --> 00:48:02,848
in his own pursuit of his own glory. Or we could do it in a really deliberate and intentional

694
00:48:02,868 --> 00:48:06,891
way. My suspicion is the more deliberately and intentionally we try to support co-opetition,

695
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:10,353
the more we'll screw it up. But the long and short of it is I absolutely think there's

696
00:48:10,393 --> 00:48:14,075
a role for that. I mean, I think there was clearly evidence of it in Splinter Cell.

697
00:48:14,661 --> 00:48:18,122
and I think probably we would love it if we could support that even better than we did.

698
00:48:44,687 --> 00:48:50,509
And how do you avoid the player from becoming a co-op?

699
00:49:14,712 --> 00:49:18,694
kind of punish that is going to fail badly. It's just simply going to degrade the experience

700
00:49:18,714 --> 00:49:21,495
for everybody. So there's a certain amount of this that just needs to be self-policed.

701
00:49:21,515 --> 00:49:24,796
It needs to be people trying to act somewhat like civilized human beings, although that's

702
00:49:24,816 --> 00:49:30,539
always a tall order online. But the other aspect to it is just that we need to bear

703
00:49:30,579 --> 00:49:37,682
in mind that co-op is often the easiest way for a new player to get into a game. So when

704
00:49:37,702 --> 00:49:41,244
we're designing our co-op modes, whoops, co-op modes, we need to be thinking about that.

705
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:44,893
It's, there is often a temptation to think that, oh, well, because it's multiplayer,

706
00:49:44,973 --> 00:49:47,134
it must be more hardcore, right?

707
00:49:47,214 --> 00:49:48,856
But maybe we don't need to think of it that way.

708
00:49:49,136 --> 00:49:52,079
Maybe what we ought to be trying to do is imagine that it's the perfect opportunity

709
00:49:52,139 --> 00:49:57,123
for an experienced player to kind of help bring up the speed, a less experienced player

710
00:49:57,183 --> 00:50:00,546
help them level up a bit faster, kind of twink them along a little bit, so that then they're

711
00:50:00,586 --> 00:50:02,908
able to get into playing single player and really get to know the system.

712
00:50:03,651 --> 00:50:07,513
I don't know how to change human nature, but I do know that maybe we as developers need

713
00:50:07,533 --> 00:50:12,317
to be careful that we're not deliberately making our co-op modes the more hardcore mode.

714
00:50:12,757 --> 00:50:13,618
That would be my solution.

715
00:50:23,245 --> 00:50:26,087
Yeah.

716
00:50:28,289 --> 00:50:28,489
Right.

717
00:50:30,677 --> 00:50:31,618
It's a super good question.

718
00:50:31,638 --> 00:50:34,278
I mean, we had local co-op on Conviction.

719
00:50:34,298 --> 00:50:35,639
We had split screen, for example.

720
00:50:36,679 --> 00:50:39,259
And we felt like it was super important to support it.

721
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:44,241
I think the main issue, there's a number of usability issues

722
00:50:44,301 --> 00:50:45,821
that come about when you're sharing

723
00:50:46,021 --> 00:50:47,861
the same kind of screen real estate, which is, again,

724
00:50:47,901 --> 00:50:48,742
outside of the scope of this.

725
00:50:49,242 --> 00:50:52,603
But I think, again, that almost is the perfect example

726
00:50:52,703 --> 00:50:56,964
of where you have two players who are co-located.

727
00:50:56,984 --> 00:50:58,964
They're geographically sitting on the couch with each other.

728
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:03,353
or at least in two different rooms if they're playing over SysLink or something like that.

729
00:51:03,613 --> 00:51:05,534
But presumably they know each other, right?

730
00:51:05,554 --> 00:51:07,654
They're talking to each other in like meatspace.

731
00:51:08,054 --> 00:51:11,115
They're not on their microphones. They're like throwing beer cans at each other and all this kind of stuff.

732
00:51:11,395 --> 00:51:14,736
So in a sense, that's a classic set of conditions in which

733
00:51:15,516 --> 00:51:21,597
the player in a sense is able to supply most of what's needed in order to facilitate the communication.

734
00:51:21,817 --> 00:51:25,578
The shared intentionality has spilled out of the game and into the real world,

735
00:51:25,638 --> 00:51:26,798
into the living room or wherever.

736
00:51:27,525 --> 00:51:30,048
So that they're able to kind of do that negotiated action

737
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:35,115
In a way that's very human and you know ancient so to a certain extent

738
00:51:35,196 --> 00:51:38,901
That's an example where we almost don't want to intervene because they're gonna figure it out on their own

739
00:51:39,662 --> 00:51:42,947
I know it probably sounds like that's my answer to everything is just don't intervene, but

740
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:44,280
But in this case, it's true.

741
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,821
It's like it's much harder for us

742
00:51:45,841 --> 00:51:47,682
to negotiate these things with online play,

743
00:51:47,962 --> 00:51:49,483
because we just don't know what the conditions are.

744
00:51:49,503 --> 00:51:51,384
I mean, you might have a guy in Lithuania

745
00:51:51,404 --> 00:51:52,804
playing with a guy in Buenos Aires.

746
00:51:53,384 --> 00:51:55,325
They literally have no common framework

747
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:56,286
in which to speak to each other.

748
00:51:56,326 --> 00:51:57,867
And one guy's been up since 3 a.m.

749
00:51:57,887 --> 00:51:59,027
and the other guy's just woken up.

750
00:51:59,387 --> 00:52:01,408
So it's, I mean, those are the hard problems

751
00:52:01,448 --> 00:52:03,189
for us to solve in terms of social interaction.

752
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:04,750
Thanks.

753
00:52:29,363 --> 00:52:29,624
Right.

754
00:52:30,384 --> 00:52:35,328
So I think, I mean, for me, when I'm using the term exotic challenges and exotic moments,

755
00:52:35,788 --> 00:52:39,711
I'm really talking about situations in which we have fundamentally altered.

756
00:52:40,148 --> 00:52:42,769
the sort of interaction space of one or more of the players.

757
00:52:42,969 --> 00:52:45,370
Like, we've changed their camera, we've changed their controls,

758
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:48,850
we've changed the way they move, we maybe even have altered their perspective completely.

759
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:54,091
So, the situation you're describing, where maybe one pl- the players have been forcibly separated,

760
00:52:54,111 --> 00:52:57,592
you know, one guy's fallen into the pit and is now fighting the Sarlacc,

761
00:52:57,632 --> 00:53:00,473
while, you know, so-and-so is trying to, whatever, call in an airstrike,

762
00:53:00,833 --> 00:53:02,553
um, I mean, those, those...

763
00:53:03,373 --> 00:53:07,794
what you're describing are situations where players still have access to their core game mechanics.

764
00:53:08,133 --> 00:53:10,915
and to the normal level of agency that they do in the game world.

765
00:53:11,135 --> 00:53:14,116
They're just, they've just been confronted by a level design constraint

766
00:53:14,436 --> 00:53:15,776
that causes them to be separated.

767
00:53:16,017 --> 00:53:19,658
Now in those situations, I think that, you know, that creates some interesting variety.

768
00:53:20,038 --> 00:53:21,279
I wouldn't want to abuse that.

769
00:53:21,479 --> 00:53:24,500
I wouldn't want to force players to go through that more than, for more than maybe 5 or 10 minutes

770
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:26,261
before they get back together.

771
00:53:26,361 --> 00:53:28,501
But I think that sort of situation works out rather well.

772
00:53:28,802 --> 00:53:30,262
I'm talking about situations where...

773
00:53:30,997 --> 00:53:32,677
you're the first guy to hit the trigger,

774
00:53:32,997 --> 00:53:34,218
and so now all of a sudden,

775
00:53:34,238 --> 00:53:36,698
you're the one that's flying the biplane around

776
00:53:36,758 --> 00:53:38,799
and you can't do any of the things you normally would do

777
00:53:38,899 --> 00:53:40,500
and you're vulnerable and you're, you know.

778
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,040
Those are the situations that I think

779
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,100
we need to use sparingly,

780
00:53:43,201 --> 00:53:43,881
or at the very least,

781
00:53:44,281 --> 00:53:46,101
understand that players will recognize

782
00:53:46,582 --> 00:53:48,322
that it's imposing some kind of limit on them.

783
00:53:49,943 --> 00:53:50,203
Thanks.

784
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:54,844
Yeah.

785
00:53:58,125 --> 00:53:58,365
Awesome.

786
00:54:07,299 --> 00:54:07,519
Right.

787
00:54:12,702 --> 00:54:12,902
Yeah.

788
00:54:20,947 --> 00:54:21,407
Yeah, yeah.

789
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:30,092
Yeah, no, really, really good point and I don't know if you noticed like for combined

790
00:54:30,212 --> 00:54:30,452
action.

791
00:54:30,936 --> 00:54:35,178
Yeah, I had my screenshot from StarCraft 2, that was like my token RTS moment, I didn't even talk about.

792
00:54:35,618 --> 00:54:49,105
But, but you're, no, you're correct. In fact, I mean, I find it actually weirdly, like, sports games and RTS are like, it's like these two sort of subgenres of game that we in everywhere, in everywhere else land often fail to look to in order to find lessons.

793
00:54:49,345 --> 00:54:56,449
But you're right, we absolutely looked at that. And actually, I'd say that, that over the course of the last few games I have worked on, and dot dot dot...

794
00:54:57,179 --> 00:55:02,221
We have spent more time paying attention to real-time strategy for the lessons that we can we can extract from it

795
00:55:02,582 --> 00:55:04,462
And and yeah, it's it's true like I think

796
00:55:05,463 --> 00:55:11,665
You know I think for like combined action in Stargate or Starcraft 2 is a perfect example of this right

797
00:55:11,705 --> 00:55:16,888
It's the that kind of ability to share resources as you know in a kind of intentional way that that I'd say

798
00:55:17,388 --> 00:55:18,608
Is perfectly exemplified by that

799
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:19,929
Thank you

800
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:33,491
Yeah. Yes. Yes, absolutely.

801
00:55:40,956 --> 00:55:48,601
Yeah. Oh, I see. I mean, I mean, okay, now you're getting into stuff that's under the

802
00:55:48,641 --> 00:55:52,423
hood that the players maybe either don't perceive or aren't sure about.

803
00:55:53,883 --> 00:55:55,803
It's interesting, we've had people ask us,

804
00:55:56,124 --> 00:55:57,924
oh hey, so if one guy's fallen,

805
00:55:57,944 --> 00:55:58,964
does that mean you're more likely

806
00:55:58,984 --> 00:55:59,825
to get grabbed in a chokehold?

807
00:55:59,985 --> 00:56:00,865
The answer is no.

808
00:56:00,985 --> 00:56:03,806
I mean, the only way in which it's more likely

809
00:56:04,126 --> 00:56:07,647
is that the second player is running to get to his friend,

810
00:56:07,667 --> 00:56:09,748
so he's automatically being not as careful,

811
00:56:10,068 --> 00:56:11,308
not as conservative in his movement,

812
00:56:11,728 --> 00:56:13,489
and he's heading straight for the place

813
00:56:13,569 --> 00:56:14,969
where there was enemy activity.

814
00:56:16,256 --> 00:56:19,018
it really is an emergent outcome of those two systems.

815
00:56:19,438 --> 00:56:21,220
And we didn't have to do anything to monkey wrench it,

816
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,361
and I probably would be very, very cautious,

817
00:56:23,401 --> 00:56:24,963
well, as no big surprise there,

818
00:56:25,003 --> 00:56:26,484
I don't think we should intervene.

819
00:56:26,664 --> 00:56:28,285
I wouldn't probably try to force the issue.

820
00:56:28,826 --> 00:56:30,047
What I think is interesting, though,

821
00:56:30,327 --> 00:56:31,428
it's a more interesting challenge is,

822
00:56:32,048 --> 00:56:33,590
can we come up with like a third system

823
00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:34,811
that fits in perfectly

824
00:56:34,851 --> 00:56:36,972
in a kind of rock, paper, scissors way with those two?

825
00:56:36,992 --> 00:56:38,313
That's a tougher problem.

826
00:56:38,614 --> 00:56:41,436
But you're right, it does seem like it gives us

827
00:56:41,916 --> 00:56:43,778
a more organic moment

828
00:56:43,838 --> 00:56:45,279
that players really feel ownership of.

829
00:56:45,577 --> 00:56:47,178
And I think I'm getting the eyeball from everybody.

830
00:56:47,198 --> 00:56:47,678
Okay, yeah, last question.

831
00:56:47,698 --> 00:56:48,579
Going back to the Capture 12 versus SolarWinds...

832
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:48,679
Yeah?

833
00:56:48,699 --> 00:56:49,419
...are there systems that you provide

834
00:56:49,439 --> 00:56:53,041
that only do one or the other,

835
00:56:53,061 --> 00:57:02,786
or that are not really...

836
00:57:02,806 --> 00:57:08,469
...succession-ready?

837
00:57:08,489 --> 00:57:08,669
I mean...

838
00:57:09,412 --> 00:57:14,138
anything which depends on incomplete information for one player or the other is probably not

839
00:57:14,178 --> 00:57:18,744
going to be very effective in split-screen or couch co-op. But I mean, I would have to

840
00:57:18,784 --> 00:57:22,990
look at the whole list and probably do a, kind of build a matrix for it, but yeah, yes,

841
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:26,755
yes, for sure. Cool. I think that's it. Thank you very much, everybody.
