1
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,160
Awesome, okay.

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,480
So what we're talking about today.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,041
The topic of the conversation today

4
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:13,101
is players are people too.

5
00:00:13,101 --> 00:00:15,822
And what we're talking about is how you can better engage

6
00:00:15,822 --> 00:00:18,163
the players in your game with your company

7
00:00:18,163 --> 00:00:20,563
and actually stop treating them like dollar signs

8
00:00:20,563 --> 00:00:21,343
instead of people.

9
00:00:21,343 --> 00:00:25,284
So I'll give you a little bit of background on myself

10
00:00:25,284 --> 00:00:27,885
just so you sort of know who I am, where I came from.

11
00:00:27,885 --> 00:00:29,465
I'm a senior producer at Big Viking Games.

12
00:00:29,907 --> 00:00:34,488
I've been a big Viking for, give or take, the last five years.

13
00:00:34,488 --> 00:00:40,610
I started off working in QA as well as other player-facing roles at DICE back in the early

14
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,551
2000s, and I've been in mobile and casual for about the last eight years.

15
00:00:44,551 --> 00:00:50,192
One of the big things about me is that I love games.

16
00:00:50,192 --> 00:00:52,013
I've loved games my entire life.

17
00:00:52,013 --> 00:00:54,833
That's why I've been in the industry for 13 years.

18
00:00:55,671 --> 00:00:57,472
When I was a kid, my parents would always say to me,

19
00:00:57,472 --> 00:00:59,433
you know, go outside.

20
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:00,433
You gotta go outside more.

21
00:01:00,433 --> 00:01:02,714
You can't just stay inside and play all day.

22
00:01:02,714 --> 00:01:03,995
So I would come home every day,

23
00:01:03,995 --> 00:01:06,416
I'd go up to my bedroom and I'd grab my Nintendo

24
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:09,037
and I'd grab my TV and I'd take them outside

25
00:01:09,037 --> 00:01:11,758
and play the Nintendo on the back porch.

26
00:01:11,758 --> 00:01:13,679
And it's that passion that's sort of driven

27
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:14,839
the last 13 years of my career.

28
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:16,880
And that's sort of where I'm coming from today.

29
00:01:21,142 --> 00:01:23,064
So as I mentioned, I did start in AAA

30
00:01:23,064 --> 00:01:24,125
back in the early 2000s.

31
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:27,567
A lot of QA work to start, which is pretty much

32
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:30,329
the normal production track for most people,

33
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:33,412
and then I moved into production from there.

34
00:01:33,412 --> 00:01:34,692
This is a look at our team.

35
00:01:35,605 --> 00:01:42,613
at Big Viking Games. Big Viking is a company that was founded back in 2012. We just recently

36
00:01:42,613 --> 00:01:48,579
â€“ 2011, sorry. We recently celebrated our five-year anniversary, and this is our current

37
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:54,185
team. As of right now, I don't have an exact count today because we are in a lot of flux.

38
00:01:54,185 --> 00:01:55,707
We're sitting at about 110 people.

39
00:01:56,488 --> 00:01:59,591
When I started about four and a half years ago, we had 11.

40
00:01:59,591 --> 00:02:06,699
So we've seen rapid growth, and a lot of that is due to all of the wonderful people that you see up on the screen right now.

41
00:02:06,699 --> 00:02:07,620
We couldn't have done it without them.

42
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:12,021
And a lot of that growth is actually built on our commitment

43
00:02:12,021 --> 00:02:15,363
to creating relationships with our players.

44
00:02:15,363 --> 00:02:17,364
From day one, one of our founding principles

45
00:02:17,364 --> 00:02:18,144
has been make fans.

46
00:02:18,144 --> 00:02:21,426
And we use make fans as a touchstone for the company,

47
00:02:21,426 --> 00:02:22,467
both internally and externally.

48
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:26,249
What that means is that people who work for Big Viking Games

49
00:02:26,249 --> 00:02:28,250
should be very big fans of the work that we're doing.

50
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,750
And the players that play our games

51
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,451
should be very big fans of the work that we're doing as well.

52
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:32,272
So this is just a quick look at Yo!World.

53
00:02:36,305 --> 00:02:39,026
Your World is an online social decorating and dress-up game.

54
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:42,348
As of right now, we have around 75,000 daily active users,

55
00:02:42,348 --> 00:02:43,588
about 200,000 MAU.

56
00:02:43,588 --> 00:02:48,670
Obviously, the numbers shift month to month based on current market trends,

57
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,831
but that's our general average number.

58
00:02:50,831 --> 00:02:54,512
The game was actually created by one of our founders back in 2011,

59
00:02:54,512 --> 00:02:58,693
and it had been in operation for about a year and a half when it was sold off to Zynga.

60
00:02:59,655 --> 00:03:03,697
And after years of success, Zynga did a wonderful job with it,

61
00:03:03,697 --> 00:03:05,678
the game was no longer a priority for Zynga.

62
00:03:05,678 --> 00:03:09,119
As the owners of the game and it being a smaller title,

63
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:10,820
they had basically bigger fish to fry.

64
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,421
It wasn't turning the profit that they would want it to turn,

65
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:15,462
didn't make sense in their portfolio.

66
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:19,304
Perfectly logical conclusion for a large company,

67
00:03:19,304 --> 00:03:21,465
but what they didn't necessarily anticipate

68
00:03:21,465 --> 00:03:23,005
was that they had a highly engaged.

69
00:03:23,922 --> 00:03:25,824
rabid and vocal fan base.

70
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:30,749
So what happened for us is that when they were going to sunset the title,

71
00:03:30,749 --> 00:03:31,810
the players reached out to us.

72
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,772
And what they said was,

73
00:03:33,772 --> 00:03:36,074
we love this game, can you do anything to save us?

74
00:03:36,074 --> 00:03:40,038
Because we are desperate to keep playing this game. We have years invested in

75
00:03:40,038 --> 00:03:44,662
social relationships and money and just friends and everything else.

76
00:03:44,662 --> 00:03:45,363
And so we did.

77
00:03:48,117 --> 00:03:53,842
So, falling on deaf ears is part of the important takeaway

78
00:03:53,842 --> 00:03:54,262
for our talk today.

79
00:03:54,262 --> 00:03:57,745
One of the things that happened when dealing

80
00:03:57,745 --> 00:04:00,368
with the previous owners is that players submitted

81
00:04:00,368 --> 00:04:01,909
numerous complaints over and over again,

82
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:06,713
but the developer chose not to listen to them,

83
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,154
partially because they weren't a priority

84
00:04:08,154 --> 00:04:09,736
and partially because they had their own agenda.

85
00:04:09,736 --> 00:04:12,878
One of the major things that happened was

86
00:04:13,369 --> 00:04:15,470
Security vulnerabilities are a very real thing.

87
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:19,273
Anybody who deals with Flash games knows it's Flash.

88
00:04:19,273 --> 00:04:20,554
It has security vulnerabilities.

89
00:04:20,554 --> 00:04:22,035
What are you going to do?

90
00:04:22,035 --> 00:04:23,536
So malicious cash injection actually

91
00:04:23,536 --> 00:04:27,019
became a very big problem for the game.

92
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:30,802
Malicious parties actually managed to get into the game,

93
00:04:30,802 --> 00:04:32,964
put hard currency into the game, and at that point,

94
00:04:32,964 --> 00:04:35,145
what is the purpose of a player supporting the game?

95
00:04:35,145 --> 00:04:36,686
Why would you buy currency when you can just

96
00:04:36,686 --> 00:04:39,228
get it from some random guy off the internet for free, right?

97
00:04:40,217 --> 00:04:43,019
One of the secondary results of that is that item quality

98
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:45,100
took a dive, and in a massive way.

99
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,203
As a hugely content-driven game,

100
00:04:48,203 --> 00:04:50,604
your world depends very much on its content economy.

101
00:04:50,604 --> 00:04:55,048
So because the profitability of the game was diving,

102
00:04:55,048 --> 00:04:57,329
they were looking for ways to cut costs on item creation.

103
00:04:57,329 --> 00:04:59,791
One of the ways you can cut costs on item creation

104
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:00,852
is outsourcing.

105
00:05:00,852 --> 00:05:03,614
This is not, I want to be really clear,

106
00:05:03,614 --> 00:05:04,575
this is not bad-mouthing outsourcing.

107
00:05:04,575 --> 00:05:06,796
There are a lot of great outsourcing firms in the world.

108
00:05:07,488 --> 00:05:09,570
but there are also very inexpensive ones

109
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,811
and you tend to get what you pay for.

110
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:14,214
And that was the case that we had with Yo! World.

111
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:17,637
So it started becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.

112
00:05:17,637 --> 00:05:20,039
As a result of the item quality going down,

113
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:22,842
the malicious cast injection, players started to leave.

114
00:05:22,842 --> 00:05:23,742
When you have players leaving,

115
00:05:23,742 --> 00:05:25,844
you have less players supporting,

116
00:05:25,844 --> 00:05:27,706
you make less and less good quality items

117
00:05:27,706 --> 00:05:29,568
because it can't be justified monetarily.

118
00:05:30,961 --> 00:05:32,802
And this is where we get to the point of not listening

119
00:05:32,802 --> 00:05:34,703
to players can kill your game.

120
00:05:34,703 --> 00:05:36,904
It's really important to recognize that players

121
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:39,945
have a voice and that they matter.

122
00:05:39,945 --> 00:05:43,087
They're really the lifeblood of every single game

123
00:05:43,087 --> 00:05:45,328
that we work on.

124
00:05:45,328 --> 00:05:48,509
So listening to them is the most important thing

125
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:49,089
that you can do.

126
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:52,411
The lack of listening and response is actually

127
00:05:52,411 --> 00:05:54,572
one of the biggest reasons that Yo!Ville,

128
00:05:54,572 --> 00:05:56,133
now Yo!World, almost died.

129
00:05:56,133 --> 00:05:58,094
So players are people too.

130
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,496
Players are a lot more than just dollar signs

131
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:04,216
and data points.

132
00:06:04,216 --> 00:06:08,860
One of the things that I noticed a couple years ago at GDC

133
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,062
was I went to a monetization roundtable

134
00:06:11,062 --> 00:06:14,004
and the direction that the conversation went about players

135
00:06:14,004 --> 00:06:16,486
made me seriously question what I was doing with my career.

136
00:06:16,486 --> 00:06:19,929
Because there were people talking about price anchoring

137
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:23,271
and psychological matrices and how you can trick players

138
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:24,392
into spending more money.

139
00:06:24,392 --> 00:06:27,574
And I started questioning sort of what has happened

140
00:06:27,574 --> 00:06:28,896
to us as developers.

141
00:06:29,635 --> 00:06:32,037
when every single person who got into games

142
00:06:32,037 --> 00:06:33,859
got into games because we love games.

143
00:06:33,859 --> 00:06:35,740
So why would we possibly treat people

144
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,623
who share that love with us any differently

145
00:06:38,623 --> 00:06:40,044
than we'd want to be treated ourselves, right?

146
00:06:40,044 --> 00:06:43,386
Our players are unique and interesting people.

147
00:06:44,317 --> 00:06:46,218
and they're all craving great experiences.

148
00:06:46,218 --> 00:06:48,039
And we can deliver those experiences,

149
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:50,401
especially with the player's input.

150
00:06:50,401 --> 00:06:51,722
So how do we go about doing that?

151
00:06:51,722 --> 00:06:53,263
Well, first of all, we need to recognize

152
00:06:53,263 --> 00:06:56,585
that there is far more of them than there are of us.

153
00:06:56,585 --> 00:06:58,246
And that can be, especially at GDC,

154
00:06:58,246 --> 00:06:59,687
that can be a tough thing to realize

155
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:01,829
because there's so many devs here.

156
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:02,950
But if we're putting it into context,

157
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,471
just a little bit of a visual aid.

158
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,332
So if we take a look at the size

159
00:07:06,332 --> 00:07:08,093
of the Yo! World development team

160
00:07:08,093 --> 00:07:10,115
versus what we like to call the player team,

161
00:07:10,115 --> 00:07:12,316
if you put them side by side,

162
00:07:13,055 --> 00:07:14,276
They look close to equal.

163
00:07:14,276 --> 00:07:16,757
But then you realize that there's more players,

164
00:07:16,757 --> 00:07:18,679
and there's more players,

165
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:21,841
and there's not another slide full of people

166
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,783
because I could do it for about another 100,000 slides.

167
00:07:23,783 --> 00:07:26,305
But there's so many of them,

168
00:07:26,305 --> 00:07:27,706
why wouldn't we take advantage

169
00:07:27,706 --> 00:07:29,667
of that great information and feedback loop

170
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:31,949
that we can use to improve the quality of our games

171
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:33,890
and improve the quality of our work?

172
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,052
So just to put the numbers

173
00:07:36,052 --> 00:07:37,413
into a little bit of perspective for you.

174
00:07:38,576 --> 00:07:43,621
One tester in one day of work can do about eight hours of testing exposure.

175
00:07:43,621 --> 00:07:46,064
And we're not going to get into ideal man hours or anything like that.

176
00:07:46,064 --> 00:07:49,088
Let's just assume that one person works eight hours in a day for the sake of simplicity.

177
00:07:49,088 --> 00:07:54,894
But 50,000 players playing your game in the first five minutes can do over 4,000 hours

178
00:07:54,894 --> 00:07:55,455
of testing.

179
00:07:56,175 --> 00:08:01,380
So that's a powerful thing because that's 520 workdays of testing in the first five minutes.

180
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:07,264
So when you realize, one, you have people who are really engaged and really interested in helping improve the quality of your game,

181
00:08:07,264 --> 00:08:13,930
and two, that there's a lot of them, you can leverage that to actually help your business grow inexpensively

182
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:17,933
while making the players happy because they have a voice in the destiny of the product.

183
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:18,994
It's a really powerful thing.

184
00:08:21,962 --> 00:08:27,327
So I'm going to talk a little bit about what our first steps were when recovering the game.

185
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:33,095
Your World, as I mentioned, was a game that had some serious trust issues with the previous

186
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:38,960
ownership, partially just due to lack of sun setting and players having sort of gone away

187
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,741
in droves.

188
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:43,825
So the first thing that we did when we took the game back was we sat down and we had a

189
00:08:43,825 --> 00:08:48,349
conversation about how we were going to reengage this group of players and how we were going

190
00:08:48,349 --> 00:08:49,931
to have this conversation with them.

191
00:08:49,931 --> 00:08:53,554
What could we possibly do to re-earn the trust of people who...

192
00:08:54,256 --> 00:08:56,458
felt like they had been abused for years, right?

193
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:57,359
That's a very hard thing.

194
00:08:57,359 --> 00:09:00,122
So the first thing that we did was we sat down

195
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,764
and we created what you see up on the screen there,

196
00:09:01,764 --> 00:09:03,345
which is our three pillars.

197
00:09:03,345 --> 00:09:05,267
And our three pillars for our players

198
00:09:05,267 --> 00:09:07,830
are number one, safe and secure,

199
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,031
number two, community engagement,

200
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:11,113
and number three, player-made experiences.

201
00:09:11,113 --> 00:09:12,875
And I'll go into those in a little bit more detail.

202
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,318
Safe and secure is fairly straightforward.

203
00:09:15,736 --> 00:09:18,697
When you think about the issue of malicious cash injection into a game,

204
00:09:18,697 --> 00:09:24,380
especially a game that is a virtual economy that thrives on the buying, selling, and trading of goods,

205
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,822
it becomes very important to realize that the safety and security of that system is paramount.

206
00:09:28,822 --> 00:09:30,543
It's higher than anything else.

207
00:09:30,543 --> 00:09:35,205
If you can't sell people goods and allow them to support the game, the game's going to die.

208
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:38,327
Secondarily, as a highly social game,

209
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,848
it's really important to recognize

210
00:09:39,848 --> 00:09:41,609
that people who are playing in a social context,

211
00:09:41,609 --> 00:09:44,711
especially Facebook or any other social network,

212
00:09:44,711 --> 00:09:47,593
are deeply concerned about their own security and privacy.

213
00:09:47,593 --> 00:09:48,994
You need to be able to guarantee

214
00:09:48,994 --> 00:09:50,155
that security and privacy for them.

215
00:09:50,155 --> 00:09:51,716
Otherwise, they're not going to trust you

216
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,998
and they're gonna find somebody or someone else to go to.

217
00:09:53,998 --> 00:09:59,281
So the second of our pillars is community engagement.

218
00:09:59,281 --> 00:10:02,183
Also fairly straightforward, but very, very important.

219
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,323
We made a commitment to our players from day one

220
00:10:06,323 --> 00:10:08,244
that we would engage them in the conversation

221
00:10:08,244 --> 00:10:08,845
every step of the way,

222
00:10:08,845 --> 00:10:10,866
that they were always going to be part.

223
00:10:10,866 --> 00:10:13,608
And what this means for us

224
00:10:13,608 --> 00:10:17,752
is that we've created forms of feedback

225
00:10:17,752 --> 00:10:20,073
and different avenues of communication

226
00:10:20,073 --> 00:10:21,815
so that players always have a say

227
00:10:21,815 --> 00:10:23,056
in the direction that the game's going,

228
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:25,317
which sounds very, very scary to a lot of people.

229
00:10:26,056 --> 00:10:28,837
because who's steering the ship, right?

230
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,359
Well, as a developer, you are ultimately steering the ship,

231
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:33,520
but you have to remember that the players

232
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,761
are the waves on which your ship crests, right?

233
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:39,503
They are the crux of everything that you do,

234
00:10:39,503 --> 00:10:40,643
so you can't forget that.

235
00:10:40,643 --> 00:10:43,345
And finally, player-made experiences.

236
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:47,981
This one's a little bit more tricky

237
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:51,443
in the way that it works, but essentially,

238
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,364
the way that Your World works as a game,

239
00:10:53,364 --> 00:10:55,085
because it is a design and dress-up game

240
00:10:55,085 --> 00:10:57,626
and a social game, players rely very much

241
00:10:57,626 --> 00:10:59,127
on the ability to build things

242
00:10:59,127 --> 00:11:00,488
and show them to other players.

243
00:11:00,488 --> 00:11:02,289
It's very important for them to be able

244
00:11:02,289 --> 00:11:04,310
to activate their own creativity

245
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,091
and show that to the rest of the people

246
00:11:06,091 --> 00:11:07,972
who are playing the game.

247
00:11:07,972 --> 00:11:11,914
So what this means for us is we create things

248
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:16,198
quite often feature-wise, roughly 60% of the way.

249
00:11:16,198 --> 00:11:18,000
And we let players fill in the other 40%.

250
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,144
So whether it be a feature that allows

251
00:11:22,144 --> 00:11:24,506
for user-generated content to be piped in

252
00:11:24,506 --> 00:11:26,448
and then shared with other users,

253
00:11:26,448 --> 00:11:29,151
or a first iteration of a feature

254
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,573
that then goes out to players, gets feedback,

255
00:11:31,573 --> 00:11:34,756
and then we build another 20% based on that feedback,

256
00:11:34,756 --> 00:11:36,718
we bring them along the journey every step of the way.

257
00:11:40,171 --> 00:11:42,173
So, in terms of regaining players' trust,

258
00:11:42,173 --> 00:11:45,055
the pillars were really important for us

259
00:11:45,055 --> 00:11:48,638
in that they created a touchstone for us,

260
00:11:48,638 --> 00:11:50,980
and that touchstone has been important

261
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:55,064
for the last three years of owning the game, essentially.

262
00:11:55,064 --> 00:11:57,446
We refer to them very frequently in our player discussions.

263
00:11:57,446 --> 00:11:59,227
We refer to them very frequently

264
00:11:59,227 --> 00:12:00,168
in our in-house discussions.

265
00:12:00,168 --> 00:12:02,109
When we're doing feature design,

266
00:12:02,109 --> 00:12:04,571
the first thing that we do is we go back

267
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,676
to that first pillar, right?

268
00:12:06,676 --> 00:12:09,796
We say, okay, is this feature gonna be safe and secure?

269
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:11,757
Is it going to be something that we can guarantee

270
00:12:11,757 --> 00:12:15,278
there's going to be no security flaws with whatsoever?

271
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:19,999
We've spent the last three years fighting off

272
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:22,259
very persistent people who it's,

273
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:25,120
I don't know where they got this mission from,

274
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,401
but it is their God-given mission to infiltrate the game.

275
00:12:28,401 --> 00:12:29,321
And in the last three years,

276
00:12:29,321 --> 00:12:31,741
we haven't had a single major security incident,

277
00:12:31,741 --> 00:12:33,002
which is a point of pride,

278
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,902
and that's because we use these touchstones.

279
00:12:36,483 --> 00:12:38,623
So every single time we do a feature,

280
00:12:38,623 --> 00:12:40,564
we ask one, is it safe and secure?

281
00:12:40,564 --> 00:12:41,745
Two, how does it engage the community?

282
00:12:41,745 --> 00:12:45,126
Does it engage the community in a meaningful way

283
00:12:45,126 --> 00:12:48,347
or is it just paying lip service to that engagement?

284
00:12:48,347 --> 00:12:50,728
And then how is it allowing players

285
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:51,908
to generate their own experience?

286
00:12:51,908 --> 00:12:52,628
Now don't get me wrong,

287
00:12:52,628 --> 00:12:55,829
not every feature can generate experiences for players.

288
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:57,890
You can't allow players to generate all of the content,

289
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:00,491
but allowing them to generate a lot of it

290
00:13:00,491 --> 00:13:01,211
is really important.

291
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,221
So one of the important things to remember

292
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:08,642
is that the industry is evolving,

293
00:13:08,642 --> 00:13:11,863
and player expectations are not what they used to be.

294
00:13:11,863 --> 00:13:13,124
And that's something,

295
00:13:13,124 --> 00:13:14,764
I've been around the industry for a while,

296
00:13:14,764 --> 00:13:16,425
and that's something that I've definitely noticed,

297
00:13:16,425 --> 00:13:18,306
particularly in the last five years,

298
00:13:18,306 --> 00:13:21,367
is that the savviness of players has gone way up.

299
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,488
Players are onto us,

300
00:13:22,488 --> 00:13:26,269
especially when it comes to pricing strategy

301
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:29,491
and how we approach microtransactions and things like DLC.

302
00:13:30,211 --> 00:13:31,652
There are goods and bads to this.

303
00:13:31,652 --> 00:13:33,413
Some players actually understand that yes,

304
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:36,134
ultimately we are running businesses

305
00:13:36,134 --> 00:13:38,775
and we have families to feed and that's a great thing,

306
00:13:38,775 --> 00:13:40,516
but at the same time, they will jump on top of you

307
00:13:40,516 --> 00:13:41,957
if they feel like you're taking advantage of them.

308
00:13:41,957 --> 00:13:44,438
And the second thing here is that the marketplace

309
00:13:44,438 --> 00:13:46,339
is a lot noisier than it used to be.

310
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:49,040
This is a good thing for a lot of indie developers

311
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,122
in that it's easier to be an entrant into the market

312
00:13:52,862 --> 00:13:54,524
but it's harder to succeed in the market.

313
00:13:54,524 --> 00:13:57,146
Because there's so many people who are now competing

314
00:13:57,146 --> 00:14:00,228
in all of these spaces, whether it be the Google Play Store

315
00:14:00,228 --> 00:14:01,289
or the App Store or Steam,

316
00:14:01,289 --> 00:14:03,511
there's so many people doing independent development,

317
00:14:03,511 --> 00:14:04,712
which is awesome and exciting,

318
00:14:04,712 --> 00:14:06,734
but there's so many of them, how do you break through?

319
00:14:06,734 --> 00:14:08,135
So we need to find ways to cut through,

320
00:14:08,135 --> 00:14:10,277
and one of the ways that you can actually do that

321
00:14:10,277 --> 00:14:11,998
is engaging your players directly

322
00:14:11,998 --> 00:14:14,000
and making them part of the conversation.

323
00:14:16,032 --> 00:14:18,154
So I'm gonna talk a little bit about some of the stuff

324
00:14:18,154 --> 00:14:20,536
that we do to engage our players

325
00:14:20,536 --> 00:14:22,899
and get feedback from them in a meaningful manner

326
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:24,380
that we can actually make use of.

327
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,044
The bread and butter for us, quite frankly,

328
00:14:28,044 --> 00:14:30,486
is the demographic survey.

329
00:14:30,486 --> 00:14:32,188
How many people here have used

330
00:14:32,188 --> 00:14:33,829
demographic surveys in their game?

331
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:36,072
Okay, so some, not a lot.

332
00:14:36,072 --> 00:14:39,015
If you've got a LiveOps game.

333
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:42,249
and you don't know the demographic of your game,

334
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:43,911
you need to really seriously reconsider

335
00:14:43,911 --> 00:14:45,092
the way that you're approaching your players.

336
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:47,253
Because if you don't know who they are,

337
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,215
how are you possibly gonna know what they want?

338
00:14:49,215 --> 00:14:51,277
You're just shooting in the dark.

339
00:14:51,277 --> 00:14:55,020
One of the really interesting things that we have learned

340
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,662
by way of our demographic survey is that in your world,

341
00:14:57,662 --> 00:14:59,143
70% of our players are actually female.

342
00:14:59,143 --> 00:15:03,547
Which makes us have a very, very unique demographic.

343
00:15:04,175 --> 00:15:07,759
One of the challenges, and lots of people can attest to this,

344
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:11,623
is the industry itself does tend to be very male-dominated.

345
00:15:11,623 --> 00:15:13,585
So how do we break through?

346
00:15:13,585 --> 00:15:16,108
How do we break that barrier of having a highly

347
00:15:16,108 --> 00:15:21,094
female-driven player base while still making sure

348
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:24,017
that our people are making things that they want to make?

349
00:15:24,017 --> 00:15:25,799
Well, one of the things that we do

350
00:15:26,661 --> 00:15:30,764
internally is we actually make sure that we actively hire

351
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,525
as many females as we possibly can.

352
00:15:32,525 --> 00:15:35,468
And the reason for that is if you're dealing

353
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:37,229
with a largely female base, then you should have

354
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:39,070
as many females on the team as possible.

355
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:42,633
The second thing that we do, and this is really important,

356
00:15:42,633 --> 00:15:46,996
is we never assume that any person fits a stereotype.

357
00:15:46,996 --> 00:15:49,938
So if you say, you know, 70% of the players are female,

358
00:15:49,938 --> 00:15:52,640
we need more female content, what does that possibly mean?

359
00:15:53,311 --> 00:15:55,111
That doesn't mean anything.

360
00:15:55,111 --> 00:15:57,712
That means that whatever assumption that you've generated

361
00:15:57,712 --> 00:16:00,513
about what female-generated content is,

362
00:16:00,513 --> 00:16:02,014
is what you're gonna push on them.

363
00:16:02,014 --> 00:16:03,794
But what you should actually be doing is saying,

364
00:16:03,794 --> 00:16:06,295
okay, now that we know that there's 70% of the players

365
00:16:06,295 --> 00:16:08,996
that are female, let's send out a survey

366
00:16:08,996 --> 00:16:11,476
to our female players and ask them

367
00:16:11,476 --> 00:16:12,617
what it is that they want.

368
00:16:12,617 --> 00:16:14,877
And then when they tell you, you can better deliver

369
00:16:14,877 --> 00:16:16,178
to them what they actually want.

370
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:20,884
The caveat here being, our information is going to be different than your information

371
00:16:20,884 --> 00:16:22,084
no matter what game you're working on.

372
00:16:22,084 --> 00:16:26,104
Every group of players is going to be different and that's why you want to get to know them.

373
00:16:26,104 --> 00:16:32,226
The really important other thing here is that 70% of our spenders are female, which means

374
00:16:32,226 --> 00:16:35,946
that they have a very powerful voice when it comes to driving the success of our game.

375
00:16:35,946 --> 00:16:42,527
Our female players are the by and large largest spending group of all of the players, so their

376
00:16:42,527 --> 00:16:44,528
voice is very loud.

377
00:16:45,906 --> 00:16:47,888
So this is just for the visual learners in the group.

378
00:16:47,888 --> 00:16:50,211
It's sort of a re-representation

379
00:16:50,211 --> 00:16:53,115
and a quickly thrown together infographic

380
00:16:53,115 --> 00:16:57,180
to let you know some of the distribution data.

381
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,443
So as I mentioned, I'll just point out

382
00:16:59,443 --> 00:17:03,468
that the current demographic data was added a week ago.

383
00:17:03,768 --> 00:17:05,691
the infographic was made a month ago.

384
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,933
So it shifts a little bit.

385
00:17:06,933 --> 00:17:10,519
But we're sitting about 72% female players right now

386
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:10,919
and 28% male.

387
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:13,403
One of the interesting things for us

388
00:17:13,403 --> 00:17:18,251
is that we know that roughly 62% of our players

389
00:17:18,251 --> 00:17:19,112
are in North America.

390
00:17:20,353 --> 00:17:23,534
with a further 12% being in either the UK or Australia.

391
00:17:23,534 --> 00:17:26,815
And what that means for us is that we actually know that our players are very

392
00:17:26,815 --> 00:17:27,136
driven

393
00:17:27,136 --> 00:17:30,557
by, for lack of better terminology, Western ideology.

394
00:17:30,557 --> 00:17:35,979
They look at things through that lens, which means that we can deliver things using

395
00:17:35,979 --> 00:17:36,239
that lens.

396
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:39,881
So how do we make that information matter?

397
00:17:39,881 --> 00:17:42,662
How do we use it? Australia Day.

398
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:46,766
So using demographic data, we learned that there's actually

399
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:49,372
a significant percent of players that are in Australia.

400
00:17:49,372 --> 00:17:51,197
Interestingly, when I say that 12% of the players

401
00:17:51,197 --> 00:17:53,362
are actually in either the UK or Australia.

402
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,243
What we found out on top of that is 6% of our paying players

403
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,384
are actually Australian.

404
00:17:59,384 --> 00:18:03,807
So Australian players really like investing in our game.

405
00:18:03,807 --> 00:18:06,409
And knowing that information allowed us to listen

406
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:08,331
to feedback from players because players told us

407
00:18:08,331 --> 00:18:11,113
that for the last six years, they had been asking

408
00:18:11,113 --> 00:18:13,574
for some sort of celebration of Australia Day.

409
00:18:13,574 --> 00:18:15,896
But it had never been done because there never seemed

410
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:18,358
to be any justification for it, right?

411
00:18:18,358 --> 00:18:21,040
It's a one-off, it's sort of a smaller group of people,

412
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,101
why would we do it?

413
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:22,862
Because.

414
00:18:22,942 --> 00:18:25,502
There's nothing wrong with Australians,

415
00:18:25,502 --> 00:18:26,863
just why would we do it?

416
00:18:26,863 --> 00:18:28,784
Because we tend to, as developers,

417
00:18:28,784 --> 00:18:31,384
target our largest groups first.

418
00:18:31,384 --> 00:18:33,385
But your small groups can have a voice too.

419
00:18:33,385 --> 00:18:35,226
And this is an instance in which we found out,

420
00:18:35,226 --> 00:18:37,566
well, if 6% of the players are Australian

421
00:18:37,566 --> 00:18:39,027
and they've been asking for something

422
00:18:39,027 --> 00:18:42,888
for the last six years, the odds are very, very good

423
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,749
that it's going to perform well.

424
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:46,890
And even if it doesn't perform well,

425
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:49,771
we have run an experiment and disproven the theory

426
00:18:49,771 --> 00:18:52,031
that Australian-themed content can work.

427
00:18:53,112 --> 00:18:54,872
So what we did is we put together

428
00:18:54,872 --> 00:18:58,413
very basic Australia Day bundles,

429
00:18:58,413 --> 00:19:01,734
and you can see that this is a tiered bundle.

430
00:19:01,734 --> 00:19:05,275
Now I will note, while I talk about how important it is

431
00:19:05,275 --> 00:19:06,875
to treat your players like people,

432
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,436
you will see pricing strategy up there.

433
00:19:09,436 --> 00:19:10,856
It's a reality of the business,

434
00:19:10,856 --> 00:19:13,177
so don't feel the need to call me out on it.

435
00:19:13,177 --> 00:19:16,558
But one of the things that we found

436
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:19,378
is that they actually responded really well to tropes.

437
00:19:19,378 --> 00:19:21,379
So we asked them, what's Australian content?

438
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:22,059
And they were like.

439
00:19:22,548 --> 00:19:24,431
give us whatever you think is Australian.

440
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:27,055
They were very happy if you look at the platinum pack

441
00:19:27,055 --> 00:19:28,117
that they got a drop there.

442
00:19:28,117 --> 00:19:29,859
So that worked out really well for us.

443
00:19:31,606 --> 00:19:35,188
The next type of survey that we do is an engagement survey.

444
00:19:35,188 --> 00:19:40,872
And we actually use engagement surveys to survey players on the effectiveness of how we're engaging them,

445
00:19:40,872 --> 00:19:44,215
which is fairly simple to say but fairly difficult to do.

446
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:48,478
We have a number of different engagement efforts that we actually make use of for our players.

447
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:53,561
One of them is we do a weekly podcast where we just sit down and talk about the game,

448
00:19:53,561 --> 00:19:55,643
chat, and the players have an opportunity to get to know us better.

449
00:19:56,023 --> 00:19:58,564
We also run in-game contests for allowing players

450
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,706
to create their own content for us.

451
00:20:00,706 --> 00:20:02,627
We also run in-game parties.

452
00:20:02,627 --> 00:20:04,468
Once a week, twice a week, players

453
00:20:04,468 --> 00:20:06,529
can sit down with members of our staff

454
00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:07,990
and just hang out in-game and socialize.

455
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,972
So these are all sort of our engagement efforts.

456
00:20:10,972 --> 00:20:12,472
But any of these things that you're doing,

457
00:20:12,472 --> 00:20:15,574
you need to find a way to measure and make sure

458
00:20:15,574 --> 00:20:16,995
that they're actually being effective.

459
00:20:18,062 --> 00:20:19,783
One of the other things that we do for engagement surveys

460
00:20:19,783 --> 00:20:22,985
is we actually make use of quarterly report cards.

461
00:20:22,985 --> 00:20:24,726
So once every quarter, we send a report card out

462
00:20:24,726 --> 00:20:27,768
to the players and we ask them, based on these criteria,

463
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,209
how are we performing this quarter?

464
00:20:29,209 --> 00:20:31,290
Are we better this quarter than we were last quarter,

465
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:32,631
or are we worse?

466
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,192
And they won't hesitate to tell you

467
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:36,013
that you're doing a worse job than you were.

468
00:20:36,013 --> 00:20:38,595
And it's a really good way of keeping you honest, right?

469
00:20:38,595 --> 00:20:40,797
And knowing what your flaws are.

470
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:45,009
And these actually have helped to drive our engagement significantly.

471
00:20:45,009 --> 00:20:49,394
One of the big takeaways that we had from one of our engagement surveys

472
00:20:49,394 --> 00:20:52,838
was that players liked the podcast, but listenership was down,

473
00:20:52,838 --> 00:20:54,280
and we couldn't figure out why.

474
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,704
The format hadn't really changed, the quality hadn't really changed.

475
00:20:58,454 --> 00:20:59,695
So we didn't know why.

476
00:20:59,695 --> 00:21:02,216
So our philosophy is generally,

477
00:21:02,216 --> 00:21:03,277
if you don't know why, then ask.

478
00:21:03,277 --> 00:21:07,280
Because the players know, they're gonna tell you.

479
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,402
We're very fortunate to have a highly engaged user base.

480
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:13,223
So what we did is we sent out a survey and we said,

481
00:21:13,223 --> 00:21:14,984
what do you like about the Your World podcast

482
00:21:14,984 --> 00:21:15,805
and what don't you like?

483
00:21:15,805 --> 00:21:18,086
And one of the things that we learned is that,

484
00:21:18,863 --> 00:21:20,504
Over time, we've gotten very comfortable

485
00:21:20,504 --> 00:21:22,505
with the longer format for the podcast.

486
00:21:22,505 --> 00:21:25,587
The podcast, and the number sounds crazy to most people,

487
00:21:25,587 --> 00:21:28,068
ran between 45 minutes to an hour,

488
00:21:28,068 --> 00:21:30,169
which is a lot of time invested in podcasting,

489
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:32,771
but they're a lot of fun to do, so whatever.

490
00:21:32,771 --> 00:21:34,191
But players provided the feedback

491
00:21:34,191 --> 00:21:35,452
that they wanted them to be shorter.

492
00:21:35,452 --> 00:21:39,234
And this is where the use of secondary feedback

493
00:21:39,234 --> 00:21:40,695
came in really handy.

494
00:21:40,695 --> 00:21:42,476
Because telling us that they want them shorter,

495
00:21:43,308 --> 00:21:46,251
isn't perfect, so we generally leave an area

496
00:21:46,251 --> 00:21:48,293
for subjective feedback so players can write it in,

497
00:21:48,293 --> 00:21:50,836
and the explanation that we got from players was brilliant.

498
00:21:50,836 --> 00:21:54,880
And their explanation was, I drive to work.

499
00:21:55,532 --> 00:21:58,272
and it takes about 10 to 15 minutes to drive to work.

500
00:21:58,272 --> 00:22:01,893
So I want the podcast to be between 10 and 15 minutes

501
00:22:01,893 --> 00:22:04,694
in length so when I get up the day that the podcast

502
00:22:04,694 --> 00:22:07,635
release I can get in the car, listen to the podcast,

503
00:22:07,635 --> 00:22:08,395
and drive to work.

504
00:22:08,395 --> 00:22:10,275
Awesome takeaway from players, right?

505
00:22:10,275 --> 00:22:13,296
Because what they told us is one, you're wasting your time.

506
00:22:13,296 --> 00:22:16,277
You know, you've got four people who are sort of involved

507
00:22:16,277 --> 00:22:17,557
in the whole podcast process.

508
00:22:17,557 --> 00:22:22,959
So that's basically three hours of just lost work

509
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:24,579
every week that we didn't need to be doing.

510
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:28,548
but also that they would be more highly engaged

511
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:30,529
with something that took them less time

512
00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:33,272
and that they listened to on their commute.

513
00:22:33,272 --> 00:22:35,534
And what happens is they listen to the podcast

514
00:22:35,534 --> 00:22:36,935
on their way to work and then they're thinking

515
00:22:36,935 --> 00:22:37,996
about the game throughout the day

516
00:22:37,996 --> 00:22:39,958
and you're keeping them engaged, right?

517
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:44,222
So here's some examples of player-generated content.

518
00:22:44,222 --> 00:22:46,725
This is based on player feedback that we've received.

519
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:51,131
What we actually do, some of our players,

520
00:22:51,131 --> 00:22:52,473
and you guys will find this actually

521
00:22:52,473 --> 00:22:53,874
with your player bases as well,

522
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:55,336
a lot of players are remarkably talented

523
00:22:55,336 --> 00:22:57,998
and are able to actually put together

524
00:22:57,998 --> 00:23:02,143
decent quality content, your world stylistically,

525
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:05,187
Look, it shows its age.

526
00:23:05,187 --> 00:23:07,127
We've been around for eight years.

527
00:23:07,127 --> 00:23:10,108
However, there are advantages to being an older game

528
00:23:10,108 --> 00:23:12,789
because our style is fairly simple to follow, right?

529
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:15,029
So that means that players, like amateur artists,

530
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:17,510
can create art that they want to see in game

531
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,450
and then we can generate that art based on it.

532
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,911
So this is all player-generated content

533
00:23:21,911 --> 00:23:24,031
that was submitted to us by different players.

534
00:23:24,031 --> 00:23:28,292
And what we found is that the player-generated content

535
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:30,653
that we receive is actually 20% more effective.

536
00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:33,620
than any of the other content that we release.

537
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,141
Now part of that is driven by exclusivity

538
00:23:35,141 --> 00:23:37,703
because it does tend to run for a shorter period of time,

539
00:23:37,703 --> 00:23:39,304
but the other part is because players feel

540
00:23:39,304 --> 00:23:42,747
a sense of ownership and they have actually voted

541
00:23:42,747 --> 00:23:45,409
on these designs through the contest system,

542
00:23:45,409 --> 00:23:49,712
they feel a sense of obligation to support the things

543
00:23:49,712 --> 00:23:51,513
that they've shown their support for up to this point,

544
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,115
which is really, really awesome.

545
00:23:53,115 --> 00:23:59,119
So this is one of our player report cards.

546
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:04,053
And what you'll see, this is a very basic look at one of the player report cards,

547
00:24:04,053 --> 00:24:08,054
but what you'll see here is we ask them how our customer service efforts are going

548
00:24:08,054 --> 00:24:10,394
and how effectively we're communicating with them.

549
00:24:10,394 --> 00:24:13,875
Now when you look at this survey, assume that this survey is about 20 times longer

550
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:18,016
than what you're seeing right now, and the rest just won't fit on the screen.

551
00:24:18,016 --> 00:24:18,197
But...

552
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:23,288
What we do is we always measure the three values.

553
00:24:23,288 --> 00:24:26,050
You'll hear me interchangeably refer to them as yo values,

554
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,952
which is what we refer to them as players,

555
00:24:27,952 --> 00:24:30,814
and pillars, which is what we refer to them as in-house.

556
00:24:30,814 --> 00:24:33,016
But we'll always measure those with players.

557
00:24:33,016 --> 00:24:34,797
In the last three months, do you feel like the game

558
00:24:34,797 --> 00:24:37,359
has been as safe and secure as you would expect it to be?

559
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:39,441
In the last three months, how effectively

560
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:41,363
have we been engaging you as a community?

561
00:24:41,363 --> 00:24:43,424
And in the last three months,

562
00:24:43,424 --> 00:24:45,927
how effective have you been in creating content,

563
00:24:45,927 --> 00:24:47,868
and how can we help you create more content?

564
00:24:48,288 --> 00:24:51,233
which is really, really useful information to have.

565
00:24:51,233 --> 00:24:54,337
So one of the big things with the engagement surveys

566
00:24:54,337 --> 00:24:58,363
is that coming up with new ideas isn't always easy.

567
00:24:59,783 --> 00:25:02,985
But we have this awesome resource in our players,

568
00:25:02,985 --> 00:25:04,906
and we know a lot of potential content generators.

569
00:25:04,906 --> 00:25:09,768
We know people who can actually fill our coffers with ideas

570
00:25:09,768 --> 00:25:13,510
when our well is starting to run a little bit dry,

571
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,311
which definitely happens with the live ops game.

572
00:25:15,311 --> 00:25:18,412
And we can find out exactly what it is that they want.

573
00:25:18,792 --> 00:25:20,273
and then we can deliver on it.

574
00:25:20,273 --> 00:25:22,754
As I mentioned, the demographic surveys revealed

575
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:24,555
a need for more female content.

576
00:25:24,555 --> 00:25:26,796
So what we did is we surveyed the players

577
00:25:26,796 --> 00:25:28,157
about what feminine meant to them

578
00:25:28,157 --> 00:25:30,558
and how we could better deliver on quote unquote

579
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:32,059
female content.

580
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:35,280
We took that feedback and we actioned on it.

581
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,902
The design contests, as I mentioned,

582
00:25:38,902 --> 00:25:40,343
are also really effective.

583
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,041
One of the important things to note here

584
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:47,202
is to beware of the vocal minority.

585
00:25:47,202 --> 00:25:50,123
That is one of the dangers in engaging communities.

586
00:25:50,123 --> 00:25:53,424
When you're dealing with large groups of players,

587
00:25:53,424 --> 00:25:55,064
say you have 100,000 players,

588
00:25:55,064 --> 00:25:58,425
it's very easy for a small group of players

589
00:25:58,425 --> 00:26:00,826
to railroad a conversation and overrepresent

590
00:26:00,826 --> 00:26:03,806
the size of their population through posting.

591
00:26:03,806 --> 00:26:05,827
And that's why you wanna use validation

592
00:26:05,827 --> 00:26:08,108
through strict data when the conversation

593
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:08,808
takes a turn on you.

594
00:26:11,184 --> 00:26:14,286
So another thing that we do is post-release surveys.

595
00:26:14,286 --> 00:26:18,468
What we do as an organization is we look at every release

596
00:26:18,468 --> 00:26:19,909
we do as an opportunity to improve.

597
00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:22,971
Every single time we push content out to players,

598
00:26:22,971 --> 00:26:25,993
that's an opportunity to do better next time.

599
00:26:25,993 --> 00:26:27,554
Now we don't do a survey every single time

600
00:26:27,554 --> 00:26:29,595
we release content, that would be far too cumbersome.

601
00:26:29,595 --> 00:26:33,938
But what we do is we release to our most engaged players

602
00:26:33,938 --> 00:26:36,179
a forum post, because we do still use forums,

603
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:39,642
and we ask them, what did you like about this release?

604
00:26:39,882 --> 00:26:41,383
what didn't you like this release,

605
00:26:41,383 --> 00:26:43,004
and how are we gonna do better?

606
00:26:43,004 --> 00:26:46,086
If that sounds very agile, that is the way that we operate.

607
00:26:46,086 --> 00:26:48,388
We are an agile shop, so we're always looking

608
00:26:48,388 --> 00:26:50,909
to iterate and improve on the things that we're working on.

609
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:54,032
And when we do those, we always make sure

610
00:26:54,032 --> 00:26:58,935
that we measure both objective and subjective feedback,

611
00:26:58,935 --> 00:27:01,657
because having players provide yes or no answers is great.

612
00:27:01,657 --> 00:27:05,279
Having them answer multiple choice questions is also great,

613
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,921
but you need some context

614
00:27:06,921 --> 00:27:08,302
for where those answers are coming from.

615
00:27:09,818 --> 00:27:11,519
And then what we do is after that release,

616
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:14,159
we'll plan our future releases based on feedback and data.

617
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,820
Now, if that sounds complicated, it is.

618
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:20,621
We move at a very fast pace, but it's very worthwhile

619
00:27:20,621 --> 00:27:24,502
because one of the reasons that we've seen such rapid growth

620
00:27:24,502 --> 00:27:27,043
is using the feedback of players to constantly iterate

621
00:27:27,043 --> 00:27:28,303
and improve on the things that we're doing.

622
00:27:28,303 --> 00:27:29,204
So this is just a real quick glance

623
00:27:29,204 --> 00:27:29,784
of a feedback forum thread.

624
00:27:37,234 --> 00:27:38,776
from players on a bundle that went out.

625
00:27:38,776 --> 00:27:41,319
You can see one of our community managers posted,

626
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:42,521
what do you guys think about the stuff

627
00:27:42,521 --> 00:27:44,884
that was released today?

628
00:27:44,884 --> 00:27:45,765
And players responded.

629
00:27:45,765 --> 00:27:47,867
Now as I mentioned, it's actually pretty difficult

630
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:50,210
to get a lot of information on a tiny screen.

631
00:27:52,405 --> 00:27:53,946
But what I'll point out is that there's two

632
00:27:53,946 --> 00:27:54,706
sort of side by sides here.

633
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:56,467
You've got the forum post on the one side

634
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:57,747
and then on the other side we actually have

635
00:27:57,747 --> 00:27:59,848
our measured data with the numbers removed

636
00:27:59,848 --> 00:28:00,608
for the sales figures.

637
00:28:00,608 --> 00:28:02,369
So what we'll do is we'll ask players

638
00:28:02,369 --> 00:28:04,170
how they feel about things,

639
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:06,511
we'll get their response and our community managers

640
00:28:06,511 --> 00:28:08,912
will feed that back up to us in production

641
00:28:08,912 --> 00:28:11,473
and then we will take that fed back data

642
00:28:11,473 --> 00:28:12,813
and compare it to the actual data

643
00:28:12,813 --> 00:28:13,973
that we're receiving on sales

644
00:28:13,973 --> 00:28:16,354
and make sure that the two gel.

645
00:28:16,354 --> 00:28:19,856
Because one of the things that our players have learned

646
00:28:20,829 --> 00:28:22,629
thank goodness, it's awesome,

647
00:28:22,629 --> 00:28:25,510
is that they can back up their opinions with their wallets,

648
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,411
which can be dangerous if they don't like things,

649
00:28:27,411 --> 00:28:29,171
but very, very good if they do.

650
00:28:29,171 --> 00:28:33,012
So as I mentioned, when you're measuring your feedback,

651
00:28:33,012 --> 00:28:34,872
always make sure that you're validating

652
00:28:34,872 --> 00:28:37,233
your feedback with data.

653
00:28:37,233 --> 00:28:39,873
Using things like sales figures and participation numbers

654
00:28:39,873 --> 00:28:42,254
and other analytics data is really, really, really critical.

655
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:44,855
And make sure that you're creating feedback

656
00:28:44,855 --> 00:28:46,615
and improvement loops for your team.

657
00:28:46,615 --> 00:28:50,216
If you're not validating data, you definitely should be,

658
00:28:50,216 --> 00:28:50,696
because.

659
00:28:51,476 --> 00:28:53,058
One, if you're getting subjective feedback

660
00:28:53,058 --> 00:28:55,000
from all of your players, especially if you're dealing

661
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,643
with a large scale title, you can't go through it

662
00:28:57,643 --> 00:28:59,846
fast enough, there's just too much information.

663
00:28:59,846 --> 00:29:02,629
And that's when you're gonna need really objective feedback.

664
00:29:02,629 --> 00:29:03,810
But if you need more clarity,

665
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,692
that's when you get into the subjective stuff.

666
00:29:05,692 --> 00:29:05,752
So.

667
00:29:10,388 --> 00:29:12,749
How do you decide what to listen to?

668
00:29:12,749 --> 00:29:14,350
That's a tough question.

669
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,771
Every player has an opinion,

670
00:29:16,771 --> 00:29:19,152
but not all feedback is created equally,

671
00:29:19,152 --> 00:29:20,993
interestingly enough.

672
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:23,454
Some players, we actually,

673
00:29:23,454 --> 00:29:27,536
we make a point of knowing our players really well

674
00:29:27,536 --> 00:29:28,937
with a relatively large player base

675
00:29:28,937 --> 00:29:29,717
that can be challenging,

676
00:29:29,717 --> 00:29:31,899
but our community managers happen to be particularly good

677
00:29:31,899 --> 00:29:34,180
at knowing who people are.

678
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,681
And we have certain players who we know will complain.

679
00:29:38,262 --> 00:29:39,202
no matter what we do.

680
00:29:39,202 --> 00:29:42,403
Every single day they'll complain about something,

681
00:29:42,403 --> 00:29:43,664
nothing's ever good enough.

682
00:29:43,664 --> 00:29:45,204
And that's when you get to the point where,

683
00:29:45,204 --> 00:29:47,305
okay, we just kind of discard your feedback.

684
00:29:47,305 --> 00:29:50,346
We still kind of hear it, but it becomes more white noise.

685
00:29:50,346 --> 00:29:52,106
And we try and train our players to behave

686
00:29:52,106 --> 00:29:54,407
in ways that we want them to behave.

687
00:29:54,407 --> 00:29:57,028
And what that means is teaching them

688
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:58,769
that there are good types of feedback

689
00:29:58,769 --> 00:29:59,989
and bad types of feedback.

690
00:29:59,989 --> 00:30:02,410
They can provide feedback in a constructive context,

691
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,250
but they need to know how.

692
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:07,814
We also try to balance the player feedback with long-term objectives.

693
00:30:07,814 --> 00:30:13,340
That can be very challenging when you have outside influences

694
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:17,965
on your product, for example, that players don't necessarily understand

695
00:30:17,965 --> 00:30:20,007
that you have to...

696
00:30:21,114 --> 00:30:23,036
deal with, right?

697
00:30:23,036 --> 00:30:26,598
So for example, if you have regulatory compliance,

698
00:30:26,598 --> 00:30:28,520
which doesn't happen to a lot of people,

699
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,462
I know it definitely happens in a lot more casino games,

700
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:33,163
but if you have things like that,

701
00:30:33,163 --> 00:30:34,985
or you have external stakeholders,

702
00:30:34,985 --> 00:30:38,807
or you have a technological requirement

703
00:30:38,807 --> 00:30:40,269
that you need to meet,

704
00:30:40,269 --> 00:30:42,310
for example, we did a large server transition

705
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:44,472
because we were dealing with

706
00:30:44,472 --> 00:30:47,134
a seven-year-old server infrastructure

707
00:30:47,134 --> 00:30:48,675
that just didn't make sense anymore.

708
00:30:49,355 --> 00:30:51,817
Players do have a difficult time understanding that.

709
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:54,679
And that's where your communication is gonna come in key.

710
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:57,940
Because the long-term objective is to provide

711
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,322
better server infrastructure so that you can provide them

712
00:31:00,322 --> 00:31:01,783
better features in the long-term,

713
00:31:01,783 --> 00:31:03,724
but you need to be able to communicate

714
00:31:03,724 --> 00:31:05,305
that to them effectively.

715
00:31:05,305 --> 00:31:08,507
Also, as I mentioned, pay close attention

716
00:31:08,507 --> 00:31:09,287
to your sample size.

717
00:31:09,287 --> 00:31:10,528
Don't let 1,000 people out of 100,000

718
00:31:10,528 --> 00:31:12,469
drive your decision making.

719
00:31:12,469 --> 00:31:14,370
They will if they can, so make sure

720
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:15,471
that you're maintaining control.

721
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,633
So while this is a wall of text,

722
00:31:20,633 --> 00:31:23,757
this is a very good example

723
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:25,739
of very helpful player feedback.

724
00:31:25,739 --> 00:31:29,785
First of all, the player's name's been blacked out

725
00:31:29,785 --> 00:31:33,630
because safe and secure is one of our values,

726
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,192
so if they wind up watching this, I got you.

727
00:31:37,115 --> 00:31:39,275
One of the really important things that this player told us

728
00:31:39,275 --> 00:31:41,336
is that they felt that the color use

729
00:31:41,336 --> 00:31:42,976
could be improved in items.

730
00:31:42,976 --> 00:31:46,117
So what that means is that we can provide that feedback

731
00:31:46,117 --> 00:31:48,197
to our artists and say, you know,

732
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,738
one of our top supporting players

733
00:31:50,738 --> 00:31:53,278
feels like color use is off right now.

734
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:55,299
Can you take a look at the last batch of stuff

735
00:31:55,299 --> 00:31:57,159
that's like, this is five minutes of work, right?

736
00:31:57,159 --> 00:31:58,280
Take a look at the last batch of releases,

737
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,280
make sure that everything is actually on palette

738
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,761
because when, for a decorating game in particular,

739
00:32:02,761 --> 00:32:03,261
if you have...

740
00:32:04,274 --> 00:32:05,975
10 or 12 artists that are all working

741
00:32:05,975 --> 00:32:07,976
towards decorating a room, but they're all making

742
00:32:07,976 --> 00:32:11,078
their pieces sort of in isolation,

743
00:32:11,078 --> 00:32:12,579
you're gonna wind up with color mismatches

744
00:32:12,579 --> 00:32:13,820
if you're not really, really careful.

745
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,721
So we always listen to that feedback.

746
00:32:15,721 --> 00:32:19,403
Secondly, the player pointed out that pricing seems high.

747
00:32:19,403 --> 00:32:21,224
And this was really good feedback for us

748
00:32:21,224 --> 00:32:24,026
because the player was interestingly both right and wrong.

749
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:25,887
Based on this player's feedback,

750
00:32:25,887 --> 00:32:28,288
and I'm gonna note that if you take a look at this post,

751
00:32:28,868 --> 00:32:33,314
This post had a hundred replies to it with 70% of the replies supporting the post.

752
00:32:33,314 --> 00:32:35,216
We don't just take one long forum post and say,

753
00:32:35,216 --> 00:32:38,159
okay, this person's got great ideas, let's dive right in.

754
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,224
But what we do is we say, okay, if there's a lot of support, we're going to look at it.

755
00:32:42,689 --> 00:32:45,730
The pricing feedback that we received in this instance

756
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,970
was that prices are higher than they used to be

757
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,591
and everything's more expensive.

758
00:32:49,591 --> 00:32:51,251
The player was wrong about that.

759
00:32:51,251 --> 00:32:53,472
The average price of the items in that theme

760
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:56,392
had actually gone down about five to 6%.

761
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:58,613
But the player was also right

762
00:32:58,613 --> 00:33:01,853
because the number of items that went out during that theme

763
00:33:01,853 --> 00:33:03,134
had increased by 20 to 30%.

764
00:33:03,134 --> 00:33:06,855
So organically, by process of playing the game,

765
00:33:06,855 --> 00:33:09,955
the player innately had an understanding

766
00:33:09,955 --> 00:33:12,476
of the total cost of ownership of the theme.

767
00:33:13,096 --> 00:33:16,419
It just felt like it was costing more.

768
00:33:16,419 --> 00:33:17,740
And having that kind of feedback,

769
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,221
having feedback from players where they're like,

770
00:33:19,221 --> 00:33:21,263
this doesn't feel the way it used to feel,

771
00:33:21,263 --> 00:33:22,804
sometimes it's right, sometimes it's wrong,

772
00:33:22,804 --> 00:33:23,925
but it's valuable to listen to.

773
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,332
And finally, the player also said

774
00:33:27,332 --> 00:33:28,973
that we're doing too much of the same thing.

775
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:30,934
If you take a look at the post, if you can find it,

776
00:33:30,934 --> 00:33:32,335
it's down near the bottom.

777
00:33:32,335 --> 00:33:35,377
Too many rugs, too many lamps, too many couches.

778
00:33:35,377 --> 00:33:36,217
That's great feedback.

779
00:33:36,217 --> 00:33:40,160
Because what that says to us, based on player feedback

780
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,101
and there being supporting evidence from other players,

781
00:33:42,101 --> 00:33:43,362
is that we should be taking a look

782
00:33:43,362 --> 00:33:46,164
into our sales figures directly for those items

783
00:33:46,164 --> 00:33:47,384
and finding out whether or not

784
00:33:47,384 --> 00:33:48,585
their sales are on the decline.

785
00:33:48,585 --> 00:33:49,686
If they're on the decline,

786
00:33:49,686 --> 00:33:51,387
then we're wasting effort on doing them

787
00:33:51,387 --> 00:33:52,988
and we can be making better offerings

788
00:33:52,988 --> 00:33:54,269
that make the players happier.

789
00:33:54,609 --> 00:33:59,912
and make us generate more profit at the same time.

790
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:03,714
So how do you get them to talk?

791
00:34:03,714 --> 00:34:06,335
Contrary to popular belief, not everybody wants to share their opinion

792
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,497
and sometimes you have to encourage them to do so.

793
00:34:08,497 --> 00:34:12,499
So sometimes what we need to do is we actually need to incentivize our players

794
00:34:12,499 --> 00:34:13,819
to engage us in conversation.

795
00:34:13,819 --> 00:34:17,602
And sometimes we actually need to start that conversation ourselves.

796
00:34:18,717 --> 00:34:22,919
One of the things that I'll point out is that rewarding players is highly, highly effective.

797
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:25,039
Rewards do not have to be large.

798
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:27,440
They can be very small things.

799
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,261
And a reward can be something as simple as a thank you.

800
00:34:30,261 --> 00:34:34,163
Just telling players that you appreciate the feedback and you're going to look into it

801
00:34:34,163 --> 00:34:37,244
is a reward for some people.

802
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:41,505
But using rewards, I'll point out, our most normal survey response rates for games that

803
00:34:41,505 --> 00:34:43,106
we've worked on are about 40%.

804
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:46,202
Which is, that's not bad.

805
00:34:46,202 --> 00:34:48,243
That's enough to get an idea.

806
00:34:48,243 --> 00:34:51,145
In your world, our average response rate is actually 63%.

807
00:34:51,145 --> 00:34:55,127
And that's because of the engagement effort.

808
00:34:55,127 --> 00:34:58,369
However, with rewards, our response rate goes up over 90%.

809
00:34:58,369 --> 00:35:01,130
For something as simple as an item

810
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:03,431
that could take an artist an hour to make,

811
00:35:03,431 --> 00:35:05,673
all of a sudden we've increased the effectiveness

812
00:35:05,673 --> 00:35:07,073
of our data significantly.

813
00:35:07,073 --> 00:35:11,336
So here's an example of how we sort of showed off

814
00:35:11,336 --> 00:35:12,556
our newsletter to our players.

815
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,861
And what we did, as you can see on the right-hand side,

816
00:35:16,861 --> 00:35:18,642
we incentivized it with a peacock hat,

817
00:35:18,642 --> 00:35:19,943
which is literally just a peacock

818
00:35:19,943 --> 00:35:22,105
that stands on top of your head.

819
00:35:22,105 --> 00:35:23,366
But players love the item,

820
00:35:23,366 --> 00:35:26,529
so the sign-up rate for our newsletter was over 70%,

821
00:35:26,529 --> 00:35:29,091
just through that incentivization.

822
00:35:29,091 --> 00:35:31,613
And the amazing thing about that for me

823
00:35:31,613 --> 00:35:35,316
is that we had created a separate channel of communication

824
00:35:35,316 --> 00:35:36,437
for players outside of the game,

825
00:35:36,437 --> 00:35:38,799
which is one of the biggest challenges everybody has,

826
00:35:38,799 --> 00:35:40,541
is how do you talk to them when they're not playing?

827
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:45,785
Just as an aside, if you're gonna do a newsletter for your game,

828
00:35:45,785 --> 00:35:49,007
I highly encourage you not to make it

829
00:35:49,007 --> 00:35:52,550
a sales initiative. Make it about communicating with players.

830
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:56,453
You can put sales stuff in there, but if you're only sending them another ad

831
00:35:56,453 --> 00:36:00,036
once a week to buy stuff, they're gonna unsubscribe really quickly.

832
00:36:02,792 --> 00:36:05,734
So rewarding player behavior is really important.

833
00:36:05,734 --> 00:36:08,335
We tend to use small tokens and character adornments

834
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:10,757
because we find that they're highly effective.

835
00:36:10,757 --> 00:36:12,018
One of the things I like to compare it to

836
00:36:12,018 --> 00:36:14,460
is if you think about the Rock the Vote badges

837
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,641
that you can get when you vote, it's the same idea.

838
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:18,362
It's a way for people to let other people know

839
00:36:18,362 --> 00:36:21,164
that their voice was heard and that they contributed.

840
00:36:21,164 --> 00:36:23,526
So it doesn't, again, it doesn't have to be big.

841
00:36:23,526 --> 00:36:24,647
It can be something small.

842
00:36:24,647 --> 00:36:26,228
It's just a matter of making it.

843
00:36:26,228 --> 00:36:28,729
And especially if you make it exclusive,

844
00:36:28,729 --> 00:36:30,571
it's all the more valuable.

845
00:36:30,571 --> 00:36:30,751
Also,

846
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,243
Always show your gratitude and appreciation for player feedback.

847
00:36:35,243 --> 00:36:36,645
Never stop saying thank you.

848
00:36:36,645 --> 00:36:42,790
Everything they have to say, even if it's terrible and mean and awful, is valuable.

849
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:44,351
And I'll talk about that in just a sec.

850
00:36:44,351 --> 00:36:49,435
Most of the time, you also want to make sure that you're rewarding after and not before,

851
00:36:49,435 --> 00:36:50,876
which makes a ton of sense, right?

852
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:55,460
If you want your kid to clean their room, you're not going to give them a chocolate bar before they clean the room.

853
00:36:55,460 --> 00:37:00,364
You're going to do it after, because otherwise you're just going to have a chocolated up kid in the dirty room.

854
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:06,625
So here's an example of one of the ways that we use feedback

855
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:08,267
in a sales context that we actually find very effective.

856
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:11,710
And this is what we call a you asked, we listened.

857
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:15,154
And this is part of a larger brand strategy

858
00:37:15,154 --> 00:37:17,276
that we use for the players to let them know

859
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,898
that we're listening to their feedback.

860
00:37:19,914 --> 00:37:22,496
while also presenting them with items for sale.

861
00:37:22,496 --> 00:37:24,897
And this is a great scenario because

862
00:37:24,897 --> 00:37:26,499
if you look at the two hairs that are here,

863
00:37:26,499 --> 00:37:30,161
these are both player-designed hairs that we released.

864
00:37:30,161 --> 00:37:32,382
And the player feedback that we got was

865
00:37:32,382 --> 00:37:34,964
we would like more colors for these hairs, if you please.

866
00:37:34,964 --> 00:37:36,625
Because the color selection is great,

867
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:38,026
but we think that there could be more.

868
00:37:39,547 --> 00:37:41,647
It's real hard to say no when people wanna buy

869
00:37:41,647 --> 00:37:44,928
more of your content, so we have a tendency to give in

870
00:37:44,928 --> 00:37:46,749
and just make that content for them.

871
00:37:46,749 --> 00:37:48,889
And then we'll package it up in one of these

872
00:37:48,889 --> 00:37:51,630
You Ask, We Listen, which is a standard format,

873
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,471
and players respond really well to them.

874
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:53,751
Sorry.

875
00:37:53,751 --> 00:37:58,472
So, how do we know that this works?

876
00:37:58,472 --> 00:38:02,373
It's a good question, Jacob, thank you.

877
00:38:02,373 --> 00:38:05,934
So, our DAU growth is currently about 30%

878
00:38:05,934 --> 00:38:06,855
of one-back players.

879
00:38:07,745 --> 00:38:09,625
And that's important to us,

880
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:12,346
because the players that have grown

881
00:38:12,346 --> 00:38:13,946
our actual daily active users

882
00:38:13,946 --> 00:38:16,346
are players who used to play Yoville,

883
00:38:16,346 --> 00:38:17,327
got fed up and left,

884
00:38:17,327 --> 00:38:18,747
and then have heard from their friends

885
00:38:18,747 --> 00:38:20,847
that things have changed and things are better,

886
00:38:20,847 --> 00:38:22,067
so now it's time to come back.

887
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:22,448
That's great,

888
00:38:22,448 --> 00:38:25,068
because these people also tend to be highly engaged players,

889
00:38:25,068 --> 00:38:26,528
and they're going to be contributing

890
00:38:26,528 --> 00:38:28,469
to the communication that we get back.

891
00:38:28,469 --> 00:38:30,029
Also on average, as I mentioned,

892
00:38:30,029 --> 00:38:33,390
the items that were created based on player feedback

893
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,610
do perform 20% better,

894
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:36,230
and our ARPDAU is up almost 40%.

895
00:38:37,115 --> 00:38:43,857
I can't go into direct numbers, but the product more than pays for itself, just by way of

896
00:38:43,857 --> 00:38:45,977
keeping communication open with players.

897
00:38:45,977 --> 00:38:52,018
So here's some of the added benefits to actually doing this.

898
00:38:52,018 --> 00:38:55,219
Caring can really help engage your players with your team.

899
00:38:55,219 --> 00:39:01,080
And more importantly, caring engages your team with your players, and that's a hard

900
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,200
thing to do for some titles.

901
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,340
How many people here work on a live ops title right now?

902
00:39:07,108 --> 00:39:09,690
So anybody who works on a LiveOps title knows

903
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,751
that live operations can be a grind, right?

904
00:39:11,751 --> 00:39:13,612
Especially if you're highly content driven.

905
00:39:13,612 --> 00:39:16,574
It does sometimes feel like an unending treadmill.

906
00:39:16,574 --> 00:39:20,397
The way that you can break yourself out of that cycle

907
00:39:20,397 --> 00:39:22,498
is to find a way to communicate with your players

908
00:39:22,498 --> 00:39:23,399
and really care about them,

909
00:39:23,399 --> 00:39:26,200
because then you're making content for your friends, right?

910
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,561
Then you're building stuff for people

911
00:39:27,561 --> 00:39:30,423
who love what you're doing and have your back as well.

912
00:39:30,423 --> 00:39:33,165
And that's a really good way to keep the flame burning

913
00:39:33,165 --> 00:39:36,307
between the team and yourself and the players.

914
00:39:37,688 --> 00:39:39,190
So this is one of our community managers.

915
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,811
This is Trevor.

916
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:45,595
Trevor is actually drinking coffee out of a mug that

917
00:39:45,595 --> 00:39:46,535
was sent to us by players.

918
00:39:46,535 --> 00:39:49,117
The postcard wall that you see behind him

919
00:39:49,117 --> 00:39:50,278
is all postcards sent by players.

920
00:39:50,278 --> 00:39:52,140
And the coffee in that mug is also coffee

921
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,382
that was sent to us by players.

922
00:39:54,382 --> 00:39:55,603
Trevor's very brave.

923
00:39:55,603 --> 00:39:57,584
I wouldn't drink the coffee, but Trevor would.

924
00:39:57,584 --> 00:39:59,426
So good job, Trevor.

925
00:39:59,426 --> 00:40:02,828
How many community managers do we have in the room?

926
00:40:02,828 --> 00:40:03,008
Thank you.

927
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:10,455
If anybody hasn't said that to you in the last month, I'm sorry. Thank you. Thank you so much for

928
00:40:10,455 --> 00:40:16,984
everything that you do. If you work with a community manager, thank them today. If you can't

929
00:40:16,984 --> 00:40:19,507
thank them today, thank them tomorrow, but thank them.

930
00:40:20,378 --> 00:40:22,479
of hard work that community managers do

931
00:40:22,479 --> 00:40:24,640
to bridge the gap between us and our players

932
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,781
and provide that feedback in a meaningful context,

933
00:40:27,781 --> 00:40:29,502
while keeping a smile on their face

934
00:40:29,502 --> 00:40:33,504
and dealing with sometimes very frustrating situations

935
00:40:33,504 --> 00:40:34,124
is immeasurable.

936
00:40:34,124 --> 00:40:36,505
So make sure that you're thanking them.

937
00:40:36,505 --> 00:40:37,726
Give them a hug.

938
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:38,987
They deserve it.

939
00:40:38,987 --> 00:40:42,228
So the takeaways for today.

940
00:40:42,228 --> 00:40:44,529
Number one, always remember the human side of gaming.

941
00:40:44,529 --> 00:40:46,610
One of the things I try to remind myself of,

942
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,831
the first thing I do when I get into the office

943
00:40:48,831 --> 00:40:49,412
in the morning.

944
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:52,914
is why did I start down this road?

945
00:40:52,914 --> 00:40:55,017
Why did I want to make video games?

946
00:40:55,017 --> 00:40:56,098
Because I love them.

947
00:40:56,098 --> 00:40:58,141
Okay, so why are people playing our games?

948
00:40:58,141 --> 00:40:59,062
Because they love them.

949
00:40:59,692 --> 00:41:01,252
They're not just another number on a spreadsheet.

950
00:41:01,252 --> 00:41:04,514
They're real, living, breathing people

951
00:41:04,514 --> 00:41:07,476
who are looking for an exciting and engaging experience

952
00:41:07,476 --> 00:41:09,777
that we can help deliver to them.

953
00:41:09,777 --> 00:41:13,199
And that will help drive your passion for building games

954
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:15,160
for years if you can find a way to engage

955
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:15,940
with players on that level.

956
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:20,463
Also find out who your players are and what engages them.

957
00:41:20,463 --> 00:41:22,884
Don't make assumptions based on the data that you have.

958
00:41:22,884 --> 00:41:25,585
Actually ask them who they are, where they're from.

959
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:29,663
what they did, as long as they love you.

960
00:41:29,663 --> 00:41:32,345
Also, create pillars and standards

961
00:41:32,345 --> 00:41:35,809
that you and your players will understand.

962
00:41:35,809 --> 00:41:37,130
And that's just for driving communication

963
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:37,790
in an effective manner.

964
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:42,294
So, behavior modeling is really important

965
00:41:42,294 --> 00:41:45,177
when it comes to dealing with player bases.

966
00:41:45,177 --> 00:41:46,878
So, if players are behaving in a way

967
00:41:46,878 --> 00:41:48,500
that is really admirable,

968
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,881
make sure that you're rewarding that.

969
00:41:49,881 --> 00:41:51,983
If they're providing feedback to a survey,

970
00:41:51,983 --> 00:41:53,024
great, reward that.

971
00:41:53,284 --> 00:41:56,045
If you have one player that goes out of their way

972
00:41:56,045 --> 00:41:58,827
to help other players, it can be as simple

973
00:41:58,827 --> 00:42:00,407
as recognizing that and saying,

974
00:42:00,407 --> 00:42:02,849
this player's awesome, they do what we want them to do.

975
00:42:02,849 --> 00:42:05,490
That encourages the other players

976
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:06,950
who are in the same, you know,

977
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:08,231
who are sort of in the same situation

978
00:42:08,231 --> 00:42:10,212
and thinking of helping other people

979
00:42:10,212 --> 00:42:11,713
to take that next step and become helpful,

980
00:42:11,713 --> 00:42:12,833
and it drives community.

981
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:15,094
Also make sure that you're making players

982
00:42:15,094 --> 00:42:16,695
a big part of the team.

983
00:42:16,695 --> 00:42:17,876
They have so much to offer.

984
00:42:17,876 --> 00:42:19,596
Don't leave that on the table.

985
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:24,281
So, caveats, really important.

986
00:42:24,281 --> 00:42:29,824
Always remember that if you're engaging your players in an effective way, you're essentially

987
00:42:29,824 --> 00:42:31,405
giving them agency over your title.

988
00:42:31,405 --> 00:42:35,808
You're still going to be in charge, but they're helping drive that decision making.

989
00:42:35,808 --> 00:42:41,251
So agency can really easily breed passion, and passion can very easily be misinterpreted

990
00:42:41,251 --> 00:42:41,491
as anger.

991
00:42:43,444 --> 00:42:45,646
Make sure you're not taking it too personally

992
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,307
and beware the vocal minority

993
00:42:47,307 --> 00:42:50,348
because they can break through if they really want to.

994
00:42:50,348 --> 00:42:53,610
And just maintain control of the conversation.

995
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:55,792
Ultimately, you get to decide

996
00:42:55,792 --> 00:42:57,373
how you engage with your players.

997
00:42:57,373 --> 00:42:59,274
If people are being overly toxic,

998
00:42:59,274 --> 00:43:02,456
you don't have to continue to engage in that conversation.

999
00:43:02,456 --> 00:43:04,017
You can give them timeouts, it's okay.

1000
00:43:06,608 --> 00:43:09,355
Also find ways to keep the players busy and engaged.

1001
00:43:09,355 --> 00:43:11,481
One of the things that we found most effective

1002
00:43:11,481 --> 00:43:14,247
with engaging the players on a day-to-day basis.

1003
00:43:15,173 --> 00:43:18,615
is keeping them busy by way of games,

1004
00:43:18,615 --> 00:43:20,456
by way of social interaction,

1005
00:43:20,456 --> 00:43:22,337
and by way of designing stuff.

1006
00:43:22,337 --> 00:43:25,479
And what that does is it takes away

1007
00:43:25,479 --> 00:43:26,600
the potential for boredom.

1008
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,221
If they're in an idle state

1009
00:43:28,221 --> 00:43:29,541
and they're not actively playing the game,

1010
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:31,983
but they are still interacting with the community,

1011
00:43:31,983 --> 00:43:34,644
boredom can sometimes feed drama

1012
00:43:34,644 --> 00:43:37,306
because they're bored and they're looking to start a fight

1013
00:43:37,306 --> 00:43:39,627
because they're looking to be entertained by anything.

1014
00:43:39,627 --> 00:43:41,988
So if you're finding ways to keep them entertained,

1015
00:43:41,988 --> 00:43:43,549
you're gonna nip that in the bud right away.

1016
00:43:44,033 --> 00:43:46,597
Don't take feedback personally.

1017
00:43:46,597 --> 00:43:51,264
As hard as it possibly is, try not to take feedback personally.

1018
00:43:51,264 --> 00:43:53,968
One of the challenging things, quite frankly,

1019
00:43:53,968 --> 00:43:57,534
in developing games is that we pour our lives

1020
00:43:57,534 --> 00:43:59,116
and our passion into games.

1021
00:43:59,116 --> 00:43:59,357
You know.

1022
00:44:00,225 --> 00:44:01,606
Nobody who works in games is a stranger

1023
00:44:01,606 --> 00:44:02,447
to 12 or 14 hour days.

1024
00:44:02,447 --> 00:44:04,548
We've all been through crunches,

1025
00:44:04,548 --> 00:44:06,689
we've all poured everything that we have into a title.

1026
00:44:06,689 --> 00:44:08,590
And to have somebody come along and tell you

1027
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:10,931
that the work that you've done isn't good enough

1028
00:44:10,931 --> 00:44:11,712
can be really hurtful.

1029
00:44:11,712 --> 00:44:13,613
But what you need to remember is that

1030
00:44:13,613 --> 00:44:15,074
where that player is coming from

1031
00:44:15,074 --> 00:44:18,976
is that they care very much about the game that you've made.

1032
00:44:19,355 --> 00:44:23,677
Remember that that anger is far better than indifference,

1033
00:44:23,677 --> 00:44:25,518
because an indifferent player is basically a dead player

1034
00:44:25,518 --> 00:44:26,818
and they're gonna be leaving very soon.

1035
00:44:26,818 --> 00:44:28,779
So remember that if they're coming at it

1036
00:44:28,779 --> 00:44:30,800
really passionately, they're coming at it

1037
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,021
from a place of truth, and make sure that you support that.

1038
00:44:34,021 --> 00:44:36,022
And finally, just have clear-cut rules of engagement

1039
00:44:36,022 --> 00:44:37,423
and be consistent in your follow-through.

1040
00:44:37,423 --> 00:44:41,404
Make sure that the rules always apply to all players.

1041
00:44:41,404 --> 00:44:42,685
Nobody is above the law.

1042
00:44:42,685 --> 00:44:45,246
That is a thing that we've dealt with in that.

1043
00:44:46,407 --> 00:44:49,150
Some of our platinum supporters, our high tier supporters,

1044
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:50,971
will sometimes feel like their opinion matters

1045
00:44:50,971 --> 00:44:51,952
more than other players.

1046
00:44:51,952 --> 00:44:53,594
Don't tell them.

1047
00:44:53,594 --> 00:44:54,995
Of course it kind of does in a way,

1048
00:44:54,995 --> 00:44:56,817
in that when it comes to sales and stuff,

1049
00:44:56,817 --> 00:44:57,758
we'll listen to it.

1050
00:44:57,758 --> 00:45:01,941
But when it comes to the treatment of other players,

1051
00:45:01,941 --> 00:45:03,122
no way.

1052
00:45:03,122 --> 00:45:05,665
Safe and secure is our number one YOLO value

1053
00:45:05,665 --> 00:45:06,425
and we always go back to it.

1054
00:45:06,425 --> 00:45:08,267
And that's it.

1055
00:45:08,267 --> 00:45:09,608
Questions?

1056
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:29,423
I apologize if you covered this and I just didn't hear, but how do you feel about compensating

1057
00:45:29,423 --> 00:45:31,044
players for user-generated content?

1058
00:45:31,044 --> 00:45:32,705
How do you go about it?

1059
00:45:32,705 --> 00:45:33,765
That's a fantastic question.

1060
00:45:33,765 --> 00:45:35,346
I actually didn't go directly into it.

1061
00:45:35,346 --> 00:45:40,649
So the question, just so to make sure everybody heard, is how do we feel about compensating

1062
00:45:40,649 --> 00:45:43,451
for user-generated content?

1063
00:45:43,451 --> 00:45:48,874
We're generally in favor of it, but the compensation tends to be an in-game currency.

1064
00:45:50,288 --> 00:45:52,249
One of the issues with compensating people,

1065
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,670
especially when they're across the world,

1066
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:56,351
is that sending direct money doesn't necessarily work.

1067
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:58,652
So we will do it in in-game currency.

1068
00:45:58,652 --> 00:46:00,413
The nice thing is that most of our players

1069
00:46:00,413 --> 00:46:02,534
who are generating that content

1070
00:46:02,534 --> 00:46:06,095
are actually pretty active players who are into spending.

1071
00:46:06,095 --> 00:46:08,376
So to them, it's a fair trade.

1072
00:46:08,376 --> 00:46:10,657
They are getting money in that they're not investing money

1073
00:46:10,657 --> 00:46:12,338
in the game for the next little bit.

1074
00:46:12,338 --> 00:46:14,559
And do you use soft currency or hard currency?

1075
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:16,300
We have two currencies.

1076
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:17,600
So you give them the-

1077
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,101
We give them the hard currency, yeah.

1078
00:46:19,101 --> 00:46:19,621
Absolutely.

1079
00:46:19,621 --> 00:46:20,102
Thanks.

1080
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:22,270
Hi.

1081
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:27,017
So at one point you mentioned, for example,

1082
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:30,662
trying to convey to users the importance of server downtime

1083
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:31,323
that you had.

1084
00:46:31,323 --> 00:46:36,330
Is there a place where you draw the line between like?

1085
00:46:37,623 --> 00:46:42,527
revealing information that is useful to them versus saying too much?

1086
00:46:42,527 --> 00:46:43,828
Is there a line there?

1087
00:46:43,828 --> 00:46:44,028
Yes.

1088
00:46:44,028 --> 00:46:44,488
Yes.

1089
00:46:44,488 --> 00:46:50,573
The problem with that line is that it is ever shifting.

1090
00:46:50,573 --> 00:46:51,714
Part of it is based on...

1091
00:46:52,818 --> 00:46:57,423
what we know we can tell them and what we know we can't tell them and I know that that's

1092
00:46:57,423 --> 00:47:00,246
a really vague answer.

1093
00:47:00,246 --> 00:47:04,510
But so for example, server downtime, where we're like, the server architecture is old,

1094
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:09,916
it needs to be upgraded because our server calls are taking 35 milliseconds and we would

1095
00:47:09,916 --> 00:47:12,218
like them to take .2 milliseconds.

1096
00:47:12,956 --> 00:47:14,517
Players don't necessarily understand

1097
00:47:14,517 --> 00:47:15,558
when you speak technically,

1098
00:47:15,558 --> 00:47:17,780
but then you're just like,

1099
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:18,781
that's a thousand times faster,

1100
00:47:18,781 --> 00:47:20,342
and they're like, okay, everything's faster.

1101
00:47:20,342 --> 00:47:21,783
That's a thing we can communicate effectively.

1102
00:47:21,783 --> 00:47:23,905
But when it comes to,

1103
00:47:23,905 --> 00:47:26,066
and I have to tiptoe around this a little bit.

1104
00:47:26,066 --> 00:47:28,788
You may have noticed that during the talk

1105
00:47:28,788 --> 00:47:30,610
I was tiptoeing around it a little bit.

1106
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:31,551
When it comes to certain things

1107
00:47:31,551 --> 00:47:34,873
that you have projects on the go

1108
00:47:34,873 --> 00:47:35,914
that have to deal with the title

1109
00:47:35,914 --> 00:47:39,016
that you can't necessarily talk about,

1110
00:47:39,016 --> 00:47:40,578
that's when it does get more difficult.

1111
00:47:41,618 --> 00:47:44,779
As an example, right now we have a number of our developers

1112
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:49,381
working on sort of a secret project for Yo! World

1113
00:47:49,381 --> 00:47:51,642
that players can't know about.

1114
00:47:51,642 --> 00:47:53,763
Just because if we told them about it,

1115
00:47:53,763 --> 00:47:55,944
they may react in a way that we didn't want.

1116
00:47:55,944 --> 00:47:57,604
And part of it is knowing how the players

1117
00:47:57,604 --> 00:47:58,865
are gonna react as well, right?

1118
00:47:58,865 --> 00:47:59,045
Yeah.

1119
00:47:59,045 --> 00:48:05,827
Do you have any tips on how to send surveys

1120
00:48:05,827 --> 00:48:07,228
to the right people?

1121
00:48:07,228 --> 00:48:08,068
Because we had...

1122
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:13,423
There was a time we sent a service to a thousand people and only three people responded.

1123
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:20,869
So how would you gauge, how do you filter who to send and to get the valuable information?

1124
00:48:20,869 --> 00:48:26,213
Sure, so the question was how do you filter the service that you're sending out to people

1125
00:48:26,213 --> 00:48:30,496
to make sure that you're getting meaningful information and sending stuff to the right people.

1126
00:48:30,496 --> 00:48:33,518
That in and of itself is a bit of an iterative process.

1127
00:48:34,219 --> 00:48:37,221
And we've come at this over time, right?

1128
00:48:37,221 --> 00:48:42,084
So step one for us was getting a survey infrastructure

1129
00:48:42,084 --> 00:48:43,985
in place that we could actually make use of.

1130
00:48:43,985 --> 00:48:46,467
So there's a number of tools that we had

1131
00:48:46,467 --> 00:48:48,188
to build along the way.

1132
00:48:48,188 --> 00:48:51,150
But we've measured, for example, sales data

1133
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:53,691
tends to be really good for basic demographic data.

1134
00:48:53,691 --> 00:48:56,473
You're gonna have basic sales data on all of your players.

1135
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:59,354
So one of the things that we'll do is we have our players

1136
00:48:59,354 --> 00:49:01,955
broken down into, I believe it's eight tiers,

1137
00:49:01,955 --> 00:49:03,615
eight different spend tiers.

1138
00:49:03,615 --> 00:49:06,836
So we will send out surveys to the eight different

1139
00:49:06,836 --> 00:49:08,956
spend tiers and just ask them questions

1140
00:49:08,956 --> 00:49:10,357
based on their tier of spend.

1141
00:49:10,357 --> 00:49:12,397
And what you can do is then you can measure

1142
00:49:12,397 --> 00:49:13,997
your response rate within tiers, right?

1143
00:49:13,997 --> 00:49:17,238
One of the things that we know is that our highest

1144
00:49:17,238 --> 00:49:19,559
tier of spender actually tends to be highly responsive.

1145
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:21,419
So if we have something that we absolutely need

1146
00:49:21,419 --> 00:49:23,900
information on, then we'll actually go to our

1147
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,900
high tier spenders and just ask for feedback that way.

1148
00:49:28,621 --> 00:49:32,384
As I said, if your response rate's about 3%,

1149
00:49:32,384 --> 00:49:35,386
rewarding is gonna help you a lot with that,

1150
00:49:35,386 --> 00:49:37,027
depending on the style of game.

1151
00:49:37,027 --> 00:49:40,269
Not all games allow for certain rewards.

1152
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:43,312
But, I mean, we've done rewards even where we've done

1153
00:49:43,312 --> 00:49:45,633
hard and soft currency as the reward

1154
00:49:45,633 --> 00:49:46,914
to get response rates up.

1155
00:49:46,914 --> 00:49:48,975
And part of that is the behavior modeling

1156
00:49:48,975 --> 00:49:51,777
that I talked about of teaching them

1157
00:49:51,777 --> 00:49:52,978
that you appreciate them taking the time

1158
00:49:52,978 --> 00:49:53,919
that you value it as well.

1159
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,299
Yeah, you're welcome.

1160
00:49:57,822 --> 00:49:59,256
Okay, looks like that's it.

1161
00:49:59,256 --> 00:50:00,003
Thanks guys.
