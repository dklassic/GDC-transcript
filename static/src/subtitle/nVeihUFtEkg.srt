1
00:00:06,995 --> 00:00:10,376
So this talk, it's all about capturing great footage for games.

2
00:00:10,896 --> 00:00:15,738
And the title says it's for trailers, but all of this will apply to any capture.

3
00:00:15,758 --> 00:00:21,779
This should be useful whether you're a developer, or trailer editor, or game capture artist.

4
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,921
And actually, on that note, who here is interested in being a capture artist?

5
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:29,982
Okay, a few. Trailer editor?

6
00:00:30,002 --> 00:00:33,543
Nice. And who's a developer?

7
00:00:34,882 --> 00:00:35,422
Okay, figured.

8
00:00:36,582 --> 00:00:41,444
All right, so also note, you can go to this link,

9
00:00:41,744 --> 00:00:44,406
which I'm gonna have a PDF of the slides

10
00:00:44,446 --> 00:00:46,666
with like the little tips and stuff,

11
00:00:46,686 --> 00:00:47,447
you can just download it.

12
00:00:47,467 --> 00:00:49,147
So you don't have to worry too much

13
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:50,488
about taking photos during this.

14
00:00:51,068 --> 00:00:52,329
So just take a photo of that,

15
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,950
and then I'll have this link at the end too,

16
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:55,770
so if you don't get it.

17
00:00:57,111 --> 00:00:57,351
Anyway.

18
00:00:58,364 --> 00:01:00,205
So like I said, I'm a trailer editor.

19
00:01:00,265 --> 00:01:01,105
My name is Derek Liu.

20
00:01:01,385 --> 00:01:03,746
I've been doing this for about five years now.

21
00:01:04,646 --> 00:01:07,287
And I worked on some games like Firewatch,

22
00:01:07,547 --> 00:01:09,968
Ooblets, Dead Cells, Battle Block Theater,

23
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,488
Subnautica, Tacoma, and lots more.

24
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:16,950
I've also worked at agencies in Los Angeles

25
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,151
where I've cut some trailers for AAA games

26
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:22,131
like Mortal Kombat X, Shadow of Mordor, Mad Max,

27
00:01:22,812 --> 00:01:24,132
and lots of Lego games.

28
00:01:25,788 --> 00:01:28,392
And I've worked on games from a wide variety of genres,

29
00:01:28,472 --> 00:01:30,015
and they all have unique needs

30
00:01:30,075 --> 00:01:31,818
when it comes to capturing footage for them

31
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,861
and the tools that make it easy.

32
00:01:35,152 --> 00:01:37,512
And so I'm going to talk a lot about shot composition

33
00:01:37,912 --> 00:01:40,393
and how to make shots both aesthetically pleasing

34
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:42,093
and easy to understand.

35
00:01:42,113 --> 00:01:45,574
I originally came up with the idea for this talk last year

36
00:01:45,674 --> 00:01:48,374
because every developer I've worked with

37
00:01:48,494 --> 00:01:50,095
had different debug tools.

38
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,775
So I thought I'd aggregate all that information

39
00:01:53,495 --> 00:01:55,396
and share the best of everyone's tools

40
00:01:55,496 --> 00:01:57,256
that helped me get the best possible shots

41
00:01:57,476 --> 00:01:58,256
for trailers I made.

42
00:01:58,276 --> 00:01:59,717
All right.

43
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:03,130
So, why care about game capture?

44
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,511
Game capture is simply video footage of the game.

45
00:02:07,071 --> 00:02:13,074
You need it for trailers, animated gifs, dev blogs, b-roll for montages and press coverage.

46
00:02:13,794 --> 00:02:16,996
But most importantly, a good way to think about it is...

47
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:21,371
more people will see your game capture than play your game.

48
00:02:22,131 --> 00:02:25,693
We'd love to think that every trailer view turns into a sale,

49
00:02:25,814 --> 00:02:28,735
but far more people will see footage of your game

50
00:02:28,955 --> 00:02:30,136
than actually play it.

51
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:36,100
And the game capture you release is the only time

52
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,901
you ever have full control over how your game looks.

53
00:02:39,622 --> 00:02:41,323
Once it's released, you have no idea

54
00:02:41,383 --> 00:02:43,664
what kind of footage will be someone's first impression

55
00:02:43,704 --> 00:02:44,224
of your game.

56
00:02:44,905 --> 00:02:46,646
So you should want to make it look good.

57
00:02:48,005 --> 00:02:53,068
Also, if you have friends, parents, or extended family who don't play games, then game capture

58
00:02:53,088 --> 00:02:55,929
might be the only way you can show them what it is that you do.

59
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:04,254
But the main thing to think about is successful game capture communicates effectively.

60
00:03:05,035 --> 00:03:09,357
And this seems like an obvious thing to say, but if someone watches a shot that you captured

61
00:03:09,577 --> 00:03:14,920
and they don't have any idea what's happening or what the shot is trying to say, then it's

62
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,741
not good capture.

63
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:20,837
All right, here's a quick overview of software

64
00:03:20,857 --> 00:03:22,700
and hardware for capturing and editing.

65
00:03:23,761 --> 00:03:25,983
There are a bunch of solutions for PC game capture,

66
00:03:26,184 --> 00:03:28,126
but they all essentially do the same thing.

67
00:03:29,287 --> 00:03:31,089
Just make sure it can capture at the frame rate

68
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,151
and resolution you want.

69
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,321
So for my indie work, I use NVIDIA ShadowPlay,

70
00:03:36,921 --> 00:03:39,382
which requires an NVIDIA card, but it's free,

71
00:03:40,103 --> 00:03:42,984
and it's good because it uses the GPU instead of the CPU.

72
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:45,326
And the same goes for Bandicam,

73
00:03:45,446 --> 00:03:46,766
which you can buy for 50 bucks.

74
00:03:47,647 --> 00:03:50,889
And these both capture to H.264 compressed video.

75
00:03:51,929 --> 00:03:54,331
But at high bit rates, the quality is still very good.

76
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:57,532
I've had trailers on big screens at press shows,

77
00:03:57,632 --> 00:03:59,774
and video quality has never been an issue.

78
00:04:01,005 --> 00:04:04,549
On Mac, I use ScreenFlow, which has lots of nice features

79
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:08,553
and can be used for editing, and that costs $129.

80
00:04:09,313 --> 00:04:13,237
There's also Fraps and OBS, but they can be a pain

81
00:04:13,277 --> 00:04:15,079
because the files need to be converted

82
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:18,302
before I can edit with them, and with Fraps especially,

83
00:04:18,543 --> 00:04:20,164
the files can get enormous.

84
00:04:22,231 --> 00:04:23,552
So a lot of hardware options.

85
00:04:23,772 --> 00:04:28,314
There's devices by Elgato, AverMedia, HotPog, Razer,

86
00:04:28,614 --> 00:04:30,435
and they all capture to H.264.

87
00:04:30,515 --> 00:04:32,617
I got a little head there.

88
00:04:32,637 --> 00:04:34,978
There's also Blackmagic Intensity Pro

89
00:04:35,238 --> 00:04:38,640
and Intensity Shuttle, which capture uncompressed video.

90
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,121
And right now you might be thinking,

91
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:46,144
well, obviously I should capture uncompressed video

92
00:04:46,224 --> 00:04:47,044
instead of H.264, but.

93
00:04:48,712 --> 00:04:50,974
Really, it doesn't matter that much.

94
00:04:52,214 --> 00:04:54,596
Uncompressed video is way faster to edit with,

95
00:04:54,776 --> 00:04:56,177
but the files are enormous,

96
00:04:56,957 --> 00:04:59,178
and most people won't be able to tell the difference

97
00:04:59,239 --> 00:05:02,420
in quality unless maybe they're played side by side.

98
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:05,402
And in the end, they're all gonna get filtered

99
00:05:05,442 --> 00:05:06,563
through YouTube compression

100
00:05:06,623 --> 00:05:08,244
and watched on someone's phone anyway.

101
00:05:08,924 --> 00:05:10,285
So don't worry about it too much.

102
00:05:12,165 --> 00:05:13,907
Editing software, I edit with Premiere Pro,

103
00:05:14,007 --> 00:05:16,709
but I tell people just use whatever editing software

104
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:17,810
you're most comfortable with,

105
00:05:18,391 --> 00:05:21,154
as long as the software supports multiple tracks of video

106
00:05:21,194 --> 00:05:23,736
and audio at the resolution and frame rates you want,

107
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,579
doesn't matter, especially if you're not sharing

108
00:05:26,619 --> 00:05:29,322
project files or working with someone else's equipment.

109
00:05:30,343 --> 00:05:33,485
I've also used Final Cut Pro and Avid Media Composer,

110
00:05:33,505 --> 00:05:37,709
and Sony, Vegas, HitFilm, and Lightworks

111
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,472
are others that I just know exist,

112
00:05:40,592 --> 00:05:41,633
but I've never used them.

113
00:05:42,654 --> 00:05:43,975
They all have different pricing structures,

114
00:05:44,055 --> 00:05:45,296
so pick what's right for your budget.

115
00:05:46,697 --> 00:05:48,299
They also all have trial versions too,

116
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:51,041
so check those out before dropping money on them.

117
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,363
And there's also a lot of good free editing software.

118
00:05:55,024 --> 00:05:57,307
There's Avid Media Composer First,

119
00:05:57,787 --> 00:05:59,169
there's DaVinci Resolve,

120
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,011
there's HitFilm Express,

121
00:06:01,492 --> 00:06:02,513
and Lightworks Express.

122
00:06:03,194 --> 00:06:04,395
These are all worth looking into

123
00:06:04,436 --> 00:06:05,477
if you have a limited budget,

124
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:07,800
and they'll all have way more features

125
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,103
than iMovie or Windows Movie Maker.

126
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,641
All right, so lastly, here's a few options

127
00:06:14,701 --> 00:06:16,241
for easily making animated GIFs.

128
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:19,902
Honey Kim and GIF Brewery all have lots of features,

129
00:06:20,002 --> 00:06:21,862
like being able to convert video

130
00:06:21,943 --> 00:06:23,883
or just capture straight from your screen.

131
00:06:24,863 --> 00:06:27,404
And you can adjust the resolution and lots of other things.

132
00:06:27,944 --> 00:06:30,505
And GIFGun is a great script for easily making GIFs

133
00:06:30,905 --> 00:06:31,905
straight out of After Effects.

134
00:06:33,405 --> 00:06:33,525
Okay.

135
00:06:34,804 --> 00:06:39,707
So next, I want to talk about capture difficulty factors.

136
00:06:39,988 --> 00:06:44,190
These are four things that determine just how difficult

137
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,132
it's gonna be to make capture for a game.

138
00:06:46,932 --> 00:06:50,434
And those are visual feedback, camera distance,

139
00:06:51,535 --> 00:06:55,178
number of objects on screen, and audience familiarity.

140
00:06:56,198 --> 00:06:58,480
If you look at your game through all four of these factors,

141
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,102
you can generally tell how hard a job you have ahead of you.

142
00:07:03,922 --> 00:07:06,382
Visual feedback is simply how easy it is

143
00:07:06,442 --> 00:07:09,043
to see something changing or being affected on screen

144
00:07:09,683 --> 00:07:11,724
and understanding what happened

145
00:07:12,404 --> 00:07:13,864
without prior knowledge of the game.

146
00:07:14,724 --> 00:07:18,005
And high visual feedback is usually great for capture.

147
00:07:18,585 --> 00:07:21,006
At the highest end, you have action-based games

148
00:07:21,146 --> 00:07:24,507
like Super Mario and Street Fighter.

149
00:07:24,567 --> 00:07:27,848
You can clearly see something on screen being affected.

150
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:30,669
Enemies are defeated, people are punched,

151
00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:32,009
and they go flying in the air.

152
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:36,752
But action and hitting things doesn't necessarily mean

153
00:07:36,852 --> 00:07:37,912
high visual feedback.

154
00:07:38,513 --> 00:07:40,674
For example, in games like Clash Royale,

155
00:07:41,275 --> 00:07:42,956
there are characters hitting things,

156
00:07:43,056 --> 00:07:45,317
but their effect generally isn't apparent

157
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,679
until something dies or blows up.

158
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,061
Everything before then is just a health meter

159
00:07:51,161 --> 00:07:52,042
slowly going down.

160
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,384
Then you have games like MOBAs, which have very flashy animation and visual effects,

161
00:07:58,504 --> 00:08:03,689
but they take a while before anything seems to be affected in a way that an uninformed

162
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:04,910
person can understand.

163
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:09,774
And then there are games like Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, where there are very

164
00:08:09,935 --> 00:08:11,216
few moving objects on screen.

165
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:16,465
But to figure out how much visual feedback a game has,

166
00:08:16,545 --> 00:08:18,169
just the question you need to ask is,

167
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,473
when a player does something,

168
00:08:20,854 --> 00:08:22,917
would someone not at the controls

169
00:08:23,318 --> 00:08:24,941
see anything changing on screen?

170
00:08:27,172 --> 00:08:30,854
Next factor is number of objects.

171
00:08:30,874 --> 00:08:33,696
It's gonna change, yes, there it goes.

172
00:08:33,836 --> 00:08:35,517
Generally, capture is more difficult

173
00:08:35,657 --> 00:08:37,478
when there are more objects on screen,

174
00:08:37,838 --> 00:08:39,459
especially if they're all moving

175
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,200
like they all have minds of their own.

176
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,161
And depending on the game,

177
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:45,542
it can be a lot of information to process.

178
00:08:46,721 --> 00:08:52,545
For example, again, games like single screen multiplayer games, strategy games, MOBAs,

179
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:57,188
they all have a lot of stuff on screen at any given time, so you have to kind of mitigate

180
00:08:57,228 --> 00:08:57,809
the confusion.

181
00:08:58,629 --> 00:09:04,513
Whereas games like Lego games or the Batman Arkham games and Super Mario have fewer moving

182
00:09:04,574 --> 00:09:10,277
parts and can be captured with their in-game camera with some debug camera shots mixed

183
00:09:10,338 --> 00:09:10,378
in.

184
00:09:11,493 --> 00:09:14,177
And then games like Street Fighter, Limbo,

185
00:09:14,658 --> 00:09:16,581
Everybody's Gone to the Rapture can often be captured

186
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:18,565
with very few debug camera shots.

187
00:09:20,007 --> 00:09:22,331
And the number of objects on screen

188
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:25,316
is very closely related to camera distance.

189
00:09:26,784 --> 00:09:29,147
pretty much further away the camera is in the game,

190
00:09:29,247 --> 00:09:31,469
the more difficult it's going to be to capture for,

191
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:34,271
because a faraway camera makes it more likely

192
00:09:34,351 --> 00:09:37,134
that there are more objects on screen at any given time.

193
00:09:37,935 --> 00:09:39,836
You can see that in games like League of Legends,

194
00:09:39,876 --> 00:09:41,138
where the camera's very far away.

195
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,201
But conversely, Limbo, the camera's also far away,

196
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:46,863
but since there's only one character,

197
00:09:46,923 --> 00:09:48,544
it's not as hard to capture for.

198
00:09:50,037 --> 00:09:52,459
And same with Lego games, kind of like a medium distance,

199
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:53,820
not as difficult.

200
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,082
And again, like Street Fighter, default camera's fine.

201
00:09:59,143 --> 00:10:01,165
The final thing that can make your job

202
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,906
either incredibly easy or incredibly hard

203
00:10:04,847 --> 00:10:07,449
is audience familiarity, which is simply

204
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:10,511
how likely it is the audience will already have

205
00:10:10,571 --> 00:10:13,093
some knowledge of what they're looking at when they see it.

206
00:10:14,018 --> 00:10:16,919
Like, it's easier to capture for an informed audience

207
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,020
than one you have to teach.

208
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,222
So, for example, we can generally assume

209
00:10:21,282 --> 00:10:22,843
that people understand real-life objects

210
00:10:22,863 --> 00:10:25,785
like a car or a fishing rod or a gun.

211
00:10:26,765 --> 00:10:29,747
And at this point, Nintendo can pretty safely assume

212
00:10:29,787 --> 00:10:31,448
that people don't need to be taught

213
00:10:31,528 --> 00:10:33,049
that Mario jumps on enemies.

214
00:10:34,169 --> 00:10:36,811
Whereas most people aren't going to understand footage

215
00:10:36,831 --> 00:10:37,991
from a MOBA if you show it to them.

216
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:41,329
So when capturing, you have to think,

217
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:44,691
are you targeting people who have a familiarity

218
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:47,872
with your game, or are you trying to get people who aren't?

219
00:10:48,072 --> 00:10:50,914
Because it's very different when you can't assume

220
00:10:50,974 --> 00:10:52,795
a base level of knowledge from the audience.

221
00:10:54,509 --> 00:10:56,971
All of this to say that's why Clash of Clans,

222
00:10:57,171 --> 00:10:59,612
League of Legends, Dota 2, World of Warcraft, Hearthstone,

223
00:11:00,252 --> 00:11:03,414
and strategy games tend to make fancy pre-rendered trailers

224
00:11:03,474 --> 00:11:04,675
instead of gameplay trailers.

225
00:11:05,235 --> 00:11:06,756
There's a ton of objects on screen,

226
00:11:07,196 --> 00:11:08,317
the camera's really far away,

227
00:11:08,337 --> 00:11:10,978
it takes so much prior knowledge to know what's going on,

228
00:11:10,998 --> 00:11:13,259
and even though there's lots of animation,

229
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,840
it's hard to see what's changing.

230
00:11:16,881 --> 00:11:17,442
With that said,

231
00:11:18,687 --> 00:11:22,989
If there are a large number of objects and a far away camera, but there's a way to create

232
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:25,490
focus then it'll be easier to watch.

233
00:11:26,331 --> 00:11:28,852
I added this slide after seeing kids at Day of the Devs.

234
00:11:30,453 --> 00:11:36,236
Or if you imagine in a real-time strategy game, several copies of one unit attacking

235
00:11:36,336 --> 00:11:40,958
simultaneously, like fire bats or zerglings in Starcraft, it'd be easier to understand

236
00:11:40,998 --> 00:11:43,319
if a whole bunch of stuff is doing one thing.

237
00:11:45,157 --> 00:11:47,359
but just anything that helps the audience see something

238
00:11:47,479 --> 00:11:48,839
other than random chaos.

239
00:11:51,021 --> 00:11:53,202
I mean, this isn't to make a qualitative judgment

240
00:11:53,302 --> 00:11:56,323
about these games, it's just that looking at these factors

241
00:11:56,363 --> 00:11:58,525
will help you know just how hard it is

242
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:00,666
it's going to be to capture for.

243
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:03,988
Also, this exercise might help developers

244
00:12:04,028 --> 00:12:05,728
design their game because if they're finding

245
00:12:05,748 --> 00:12:07,670
that their game doesn't communicate well visually,

246
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,330
there might be a way to improve it.

247
00:12:11,191 --> 00:12:12,252
And, okay, something.

248
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,663
that we need to clear up, which is game capture

249
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:21,546
isn't just playing the game and hoping

250
00:12:21,626 --> 00:12:22,647
that you get something good.

251
00:12:23,188 --> 00:12:25,189
That's how you start the process,

252
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:27,651
but once you find a good moment that you want,

253
00:12:27,931 --> 00:12:30,073
what you want to do is then perfect that moment

254
00:12:30,553 --> 00:12:32,975
until it's the ideal version of what you want,

255
00:12:33,516 --> 00:12:37,199
which doesn't necessarily mean perfectly played gameplay.

256
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:40,041
It's just getting a shot that shows what you want it to

257
00:12:40,842 --> 00:12:43,063
because game capture is filmmaking.

258
00:12:43,868 --> 00:12:46,571
you're communicating with film language, not game language.

259
00:12:47,371 --> 00:12:49,153
So you have to think purely visually,

260
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:51,175
since the audience doesn't have their hands

261
00:12:51,235 --> 00:12:51,856
on the controller.

262
00:12:53,417 --> 00:12:55,319
So when you're a capture artist,

263
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,261
you're wearing multiple hats.

264
00:12:58,042 --> 00:13:00,404
You're the director, because you're deciding

265
00:13:00,424 --> 00:13:02,867
the purpose of the shot, how to frame the action,

266
00:13:03,507 --> 00:13:05,069
and where and how the characters move,

267
00:13:05,489 --> 00:13:06,791
and the tempo of all those things.

268
00:13:07,678 --> 00:13:10,779
You're the camera person because obviously you move the camera.

269
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,661
And you're a puppeteer because when you capture,

270
00:13:15,681 --> 00:13:17,801
you're not really playing the game like you normally would.

271
00:13:18,182 --> 00:13:20,242
You're controlling the game and trying

272
00:13:20,282 --> 00:13:22,303
to create shots for a specific purpose.

273
00:13:22,943 --> 00:13:24,403
And like a puppeteer, you're trying

274
00:13:24,423 --> 00:13:27,224
to give a performance through the avatar you're controlling.

275
00:13:28,244 --> 00:13:31,986
So with that in mind, here are three things

276
00:13:32,086 --> 00:13:33,626
to focus on when you're capturing.

277
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:35,186
Composition.

278
00:13:36,754 --> 00:13:39,195
readability, and performance.

279
00:13:41,675 --> 00:13:44,236
Composition is simply deciding how to frame

280
00:13:44,516 --> 00:13:46,437
the character's objects or environment.

281
00:13:47,357 --> 00:13:48,177
Depending on the game,

282
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:49,918
the default camera will be different.

283
00:13:51,438 --> 00:13:53,739
Third-person games tend to be center-framed,

284
00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:57,059
and centering is a good, safe way to compose your shots.

285
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,980
If you want to keep things simple,

286
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,941
just keep the focus of the shot to the center at all times.

287
00:14:03,621 --> 00:14:05,202
2D games like platformers and,

288
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:11,745
sometimes need some reframing in post because either the character jumps all over the screen or

289
00:14:11,925 --> 00:14:15,188
favors the left or the right in like in a point-and-click adventure game.

290
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:19,670
Next tip, use the rule of thirds

291
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,511
to help your shot composition.

292
00:14:22,172 --> 00:14:25,234
Simply just dividing the shot into a three by three grid

293
00:14:25,474 --> 00:14:27,936
and composing your shot so the subject or subjects

294
00:14:28,636 --> 00:14:31,098
generally fall in the lines or in thirds.

295
00:14:31,798 --> 00:14:32,799
And when you do this,

296
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,721
the shots tend to look very aesthetically pleasing.

297
00:14:36,862 --> 00:14:38,203
If you're not gonna center frame things,

298
00:14:38,623 --> 00:14:39,584
this is a good way to do it.

299
00:14:40,805 --> 00:14:43,206
Which brings me to my next tip, which is...

300
00:14:44,457 --> 00:14:46,718
create a three by three grid for your monitor

301
00:14:46,878 --> 00:14:50,120
with string and tape or whatever else you have available.

302
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,742
This is a photo of my TV when I'm capturing

303
00:14:53,762 --> 00:14:56,443
which has my makeshift grid I just made out of string

304
00:14:56,484 --> 00:14:57,624
and some blue painter's tape.

305
00:14:58,885 --> 00:15:00,666
When I'm setting up I just open a JPEG

306
00:15:00,686 --> 00:15:03,688
of a three by three grid that I have on my computer

307
00:15:04,428 --> 00:15:05,709
and display it at full screen

308
00:15:06,109 --> 00:15:08,210
and then just align the string to the lines.

309
00:15:09,571 --> 00:15:10,472
And it helps me compose.

310
00:15:11,692 --> 00:15:12,153
Similarly,

311
00:15:13,364 --> 00:15:15,147
create a three by three grid image

312
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:16,731
to overlay in your editing software.

313
00:15:17,432 --> 00:15:19,797
This helps give you some nice guides

314
00:15:20,037 --> 00:15:22,743
if you ever need to zoom in and reframe your shots.

315
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:29,453
Next tip is put a sticky or piece of tape or whatever

316
00:15:29,953 --> 00:15:32,214
on your monitor to replace the crosshairs

317
00:15:32,274 --> 00:15:33,235
if there's one in your game.

318
00:15:34,335 --> 00:15:35,476
First person, third person.

319
00:15:35,496 --> 00:15:37,117
Because when you're capturing,

320
00:15:37,257 --> 00:15:39,898
you usually don't want to have the in-game crosshairs on,

321
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:41,979
so putting a sticky on the monitor

322
00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:44,061
allows you to know where the center is

323
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:45,401
even when it's turned off.

324
00:15:46,082 --> 00:15:47,102
It's a simple little thing.

325
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,502
Capture at higher resolution than your final output.

326
00:15:52,522 --> 00:15:55,384
You don't have to do this with all your capture,

327
00:15:55,444 --> 00:15:58,146
but for shots that you know you're gonna reframe in post,

328
00:15:58,887 --> 00:16:02,309
this lets you avoid blurriness if you scale the image up.

329
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,632
Or alternately, if you're working on a pixel art game,

330
00:16:06,072 --> 00:16:07,273
here's a tip that I learned

331
00:16:07,413 --> 00:16:10,075
from fellow trailer maker Kurt Gartner,

332
00:16:10,755 --> 00:16:14,398
which is to upscale video of pixel art in After Effects.

333
00:16:16,478 --> 00:16:19,139
Simply, when you put a video clip into After Effects,

334
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:21,040
you can set the quality to draft,

335
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,260
which enables nearest neighbor scaling.

336
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,401
So, the pixels won't get as blurry when you scale it up.

337
00:16:26,101 --> 00:16:28,162
And then you precomp that.

338
00:16:28,382 --> 00:16:30,263
So, if you had like a 1080p clip,

339
00:16:30,563 --> 00:16:32,664
scale it up to 4K, precomp it,

340
00:16:33,064 --> 00:16:34,845
and then edit in a 1080 sequence.

341
00:16:35,425 --> 00:16:37,345
And this will let the pixel art stay sharper

342
00:16:37,766 --> 00:16:38,586
when you want to zoom in.

343
00:16:40,215 --> 00:16:43,357
And that said, I frequently scale up footage to like 150%,

344
00:16:43,397 --> 00:16:48,201
and it doesn't really cause that much visual degradation.

345
00:16:48,822 --> 00:16:51,824
And again, all getting recompressed and put on YouTube

346
00:16:51,924 --> 00:16:53,045
and watched on the phone anyway.

347
00:16:55,928 --> 00:16:57,909
And another very important consideration

348
00:16:57,949 --> 00:17:01,892
for shot composition and editing in trailers is eye trace.

349
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:08,344
Eye trace is simply being aware of what the audience's eyes are looking at and making

350
00:17:08,404 --> 00:17:13,408
sure that when you cut to a shot, you're not forcing them to reorient their eyes too much.

351
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:18,692
This is especially important for games where the camera doesn't move too much, but the

352
00:17:18,712 --> 00:17:19,233
characters do.

353
00:17:20,033 --> 00:17:21,914
But most of the games I've worked on,

354
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,375
the action's pretty centered, so here's an example

355
00:17:24,515 --> 00:17:26,656
from Kurt Gartner's trailer for Celeste,

356
00:17:26,756 --> 00:17:28,137
which has very good eye trace.

357
00:17:28,977 --> 00:17:30,378
I overlaid a little pink circle,

358
00:17:30,398 --> 00:17:32,719
and it shows you how the subject moves from cut to cut,

359
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:34,600
and you can see what I'm talking about.

360
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,801
You don't have to move your eyes around too much

361
00:17:36,861 --> 00:17:38,482
to keep following what's going on,

362
00:17:38,622 --> 00:17:40,522
and it can get cut very fast because of that.

363
00:17:42,863 --> 00:17:45,765
Just to give you an idea of how bad eye trace

364
00:17:45,825 --> 00:17:46,665
can affect the trailer.

365
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:51,472
I cut together this reel, which while watching it,

366
00:17:51,512 --> 00:17:54,475
just try to keep track of the action and pay attention to,

367
00:17:55,396 --> 00:17:57,718
sorry, pay attention to how much more work it is

368
00:17:57,758 --> 00:17:58,639
to just do that.

369
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,003
And trailers are generally cut pretty fast,

370
00:18:02,063 --> 00:18:04,705
so if you have bad eye trace, forces the audience

371
00:18:04,745 --> 00:18:06,847
to work really hard to watch the trailer.

372
00:18:08,028 --> 00:18:08,929
And the thing is,

373
00:18:10,514 --> 00:18:12,395
When the audience's eyes get lost,

374
00:18:12,776 --> 00:18:14,257
they stop retaining information.

375
00:18:15,277 --> 00:18:17,138
So you just have to make your footage

376
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:18,860
as easy to watch as possible.

377
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:23,783
And to this point, I have some recommended viewing.

378
00:18:24,863 --> 00:18:28,246
Which first is, why is it so hard to remember

379
00:18:28,306 --> 00:18:31,087
what happens in Transformers by Lindsay Ellis

380
00:18:32,248 --> 00:18:34,770
and Mad Max Center Framed by Vasi Nedimanski.

381
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:37,830
These are very good video essays.

382
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:41,231
Also, Jackie Chan, My Stunts.

383
00:18:41,531 --> 00:18:42,631
This is a great documentary.

384
00:18:43,111 --> 00:18:45,933
It's really hard to find a DVD for, but it's on YouTube.

385
00:18:47,453 --> 00:18:50,874
This documentary's great first because it's amazing,

386
00:18:51,695 --> 00:18:54,476
and it's very inspiring, and mostly because...

387
00:18:55,316 --> 00:18:57,777
At the end of it, he choreographs a fight scene

388
00:18:57,877 --> 00:18:59,978
and shows you both the good takes and the bad takes

389
00:19:00,178 --> 00:19:03,280
and why a shot was rejected or put into the final edit.

390
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,121
So like here, he's trying to get the bottle

391
00:19:05,141 --> 00:19:06,021
in the center of the frame.

392
00:19:06,401 --> 00:19:08,002
So that last one was the best take.

393
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,743
It's really very instructional.

394
00:19:12,744 --> 00:19:16,266
Okay, moving on to readability.

395
00:19:17,204 --> 00:19:18,925
which is related to composition,

396
00:19:19,005 --> 00:19:21,307
but it has more to do with simplifying your shot

397
00:19:21,407 --> 00:19:23,688
so that it's very easy to digest very quickly.

398
00:19:24,989 --> 00:19:27,830
You can see each of these photos has two cats in them,

399
00:19:27,991 --> 00:19:31,513
but the one on the left takes you ever so slightly longer

400
00:19:31,573 --> 00:19:34,675
to be sure of it because I have a shirt on the floor

401
00:19:34,775 --> 00:19:36,536
and there's my shoulder bag there,

402
00:19:36,996 --> 00:19:38,137
whereas the photo on the right

403
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:39,798
has nothing else dark in the frame,

404
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,098
so it's much easier to read.

405
00:19:43,428 --> 00:19:46,510
because sometimes games can be very chaotic.

406
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,831
There's numbers and visual effects

407
00:19:48,931 --> 00:19:50,192
and explosions everywhere.

408
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:52,834
It's easy to understand when you're playing

409
00:19:53,374 --> 00:19:55,235
and being selective about your focus,

410
00:19:55,355 --> 00:19:57,296
but when the game is being shown to you

411
00:19:57,457 --> 00:19:59,178
as a series of rapid images,

412
00:19:59,778 --> 00:20:01,299
the simpler the frame, the better.

413
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:06,050
You might want to show as much as possible,

414
00:20:06,351 --> 00:20:07,991
but the goal is to make sure the audience

415
00:20:08,191 --> 00:20:11,453
remembers what they see, otherwise it's all useless.

416
00:20:12,093 --> 00:20:14,675
For example, in most of my dead cells capture,

417
00:20:15,155 --> 00:20:17,476
I made sure to kill all the extraneous enemies

418
00:20:17,696 --> 00:20:19,477
that would have been competing for attention.

419
00:20:20,658 --> 00:20:23,039
And the thing that I say is that

420
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:26,961
a shot that says too much communicates nothing.

421
00:20:28,015 --> 00:20:30,836
If I just flash this photo of cats onto the screen,

422
00:20:30,937 --> 00:20:34,198
the only information you could retain is probably,

423
00:20:34,218 --> 00:20:35,539
that's a whole lot of cats.

424
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,541
But if what I wanted you to know was

425
00:20:38,941 --> 00:20:40,462
how many gray tabbies there are,

426
00:20:40,903 --> 00:20:42,904
then there's no way you'd be able to figure it out

427
00:20:43,164 --> 00:20:44,104
in a short period of time.

428
00:20:46,026 --> 00:20:49,087
It's much better if you show the audience one thing

429
00:20:49,408 --> 00:20:50,208
and they remember it,

430
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,210
than showing them multiple and they just forget them all.

431
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,557
and it can be something as simple as,

432
00:20:56,577 --> 00:20:58,722
I'm sorry, I forgot to advance that.

433
00:21:00,531 --> 00:21:03,453
It's something as simple as just zooming in on the frame,

434
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,314
especially with 2D platformers.

435
00:21:05,774 --> 00:21:07,055
These are both the same shot,

436
00:21:07,616 --> 00:21:09,157
but the right one's zoomed in.

437
00:21:09,337 --> 00:21:11,599
You can see that there's so much more information

438
00:21:11,659 --> 00:21:12,920
on the left screen than the right.

439
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,881
It takes longer to read,

440
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:17,683
and by the time the audience finds the subject,

441
00:21:17,703 --> 00:21:19,185
the shot might be over.

442
00:21:20,706 --> 00:21:22,127
And there's a simple thing you can do

443
00:21:22,167 --> 00:21:23,908
to test how readable a shot is,

444
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:25,489
and that is to,

445
00:21:27,471 --> 00:21:28,211
once it advances,

446
00:21:30,531 --> 00:21:31,112
Any time now.

447
00:21:33,774 --> 00:21:33,994
Oops.

448
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:38,478
Squint at your shots to check their readability.

449
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:43,042
This blurs your vision and then instantly shows you

450
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:45,705
what stands out when you can't pay attention to the details.

451
00:21:46,485 --> 00:21:48,267
So take a look at these shots again.

452
00:21:48,287 --> 00:21:50,569
If I blur them out,

453
00:21:51,684 --> 00:21:53,405
like you're squinting, you can tell right away

454
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:55,006
that there are a lot of things competing

455
00:21:55,046 --> 00:21:56,086
for your attention on the left.

456
00:21:57,147 --> 00:21:59,208
If the thing that your eye gravitates to in the shot

457
00:21:59,848 --> 00:22:01,949
when it's blurry isn't what you want it to be,

458
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:03,770
then consider how you can change it.

459
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,891
Zooming in is just one possible solution.

460
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,413
It could be something as simple as just removing the items

461
00:22:10,573 --> 00:22:11,713
or enemies from the screen.

462
00:22:12,074 --> 00:22:15,155
For example, if I removed all the yetis and the gold

463
00:22:15,235 --> 00:22:17,736
on the shot on the left, it'd be way easier to understand.

464
00:22:19,437 --> 00:22:21,118
And a Twitter account that I recommend.

465
00:22:21,828 --> 00:22:23,769
is at micro trailers.

466
00:22:24,229 --> 00:22:27,110
This is a bot that just takes six random seconds

467
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,310
for the trailer of every single Steam release.

468
00:22:30,071 --> 00:22:32,692
And it's just like a good way to see which games look good

469
00:22:32,752 --> 00:22:34,052
in very short video clips.

470
00:22:34,192 --> 00:22:37,113
It's very educational and amusing.

471
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,615
Moving on to performance.

472
00:22:42,755 --> 00:22:44,216
Like I said before, when you're capturing,

473
00:22:44,356 --> 00:22:46,717
you're essentially puppeting the game character

474
00:22:46,877 --> 00:22:47,837
and creating a performance.

475
00:22:48,786 --> 00:22:50,547
But what you need to think about is,

476
00:22:51,007 --> 00:22:53,949
are you performing as the character in the game,

477
00:22:54,889 --> 00:22:58,371
or are you capturing the player interacting with the game?

478
00:23:00,892 --> 00:23:03,572
So here's some capture for Uncharted Lost Legacy

479
00:23:03,612 --> 00:23:05,493
that I got from AtSoonHeLegend,

480
00:23:05,793 --> 00:23:08,453
who posts amazing animated gifs on Twitter.

481
00:23:09,334 --> 00:23:11,054
This is captured like Chloe Frazier's

482
00:23:11,094 --> 00:23:13,755
just the most amazing adventurer in the world.

483
00:23:14,655 --> 00:23:17,896
Whereas in this version,

484
00:23:18,536 --> 00:23:20,256
it looks like it's by a person

485
00:23:20,436 --> 00:23:22,877
messing around on the couch in front of their TV.

486
00:23:23,997 --> 00:23:25,598
Each of these approaches are valid,

487
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:27,098
it just depends on the context

488
00:23:27,358 --> 00:23:28,638
that the capture is being used in.

489
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:31,350
every game has different capture needs.

490
00:23:31,691 --> 00:23:35,014
So games focused on character and story,

491
00:23:35,594 --> 00:23:38,256
it usually makes most sense to perform

492
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:40,158
according to what's happening in the scene

493
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:42,860
and play like you're a character in the game.

494
00:23:43,441 --> 00:23:46,123
Whereas games focused on the player,

495
00:23:46,203 --> 00:23:48,105
like multiplayer and competitive games,

496
00:23:48,725 --> 00:23:50,827
are all about the people at the controls.

497
00:23:50,947 --> 00:23:53,209
So the capture is about showing the audience

498
00:23:53,249 --> 00:23:55,211
what they'll literally be doing in the game.

499
00:23:56,475 --> 00:23:58,757
And then some games tread the line

500
00:23:58,817 --> 00:24:01,779
because they can both be about the characters in the game

501
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,522
or the player expressing themselves through the game.

502
00:24:04,542 --> 00:24:06,824
So you have to capture accordingly.

503
00:24:09,266 --> 00:24:11,728
So how the heck can you give a performance

504
00:24:11,848 --> 00:24:13,429
with a keyboard or a controller?

505
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,711
The thing that you need to remember

506
00:24:16,412 --> 00:24:18,434
is that movement is character.

507
00:24:19,888 --> 00:24:22,571
You might not have much control over character animation,

508
00:24:22,611 --> 00:24:24,853
but how you move a character or the camera

509
00:24:25,493 --> 00:24:27,035
conveys so much personality,

510
00:24:27,075 --> 00:24:29,618
whether it's a 2D platformer, third-person game,

511
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,560
or first-person game, or others.

512
00:24:32,641 --> 00:24:36,324
And even just how a mouse cursor moves

513
00:24:36,364 --> 00:24:37,986
can just show character and personality.

514
00:24:39,468 --> 00:24:41,630
Think about this, when you look at a car driving,

515
00:24:42,675 --> 00:24:43,816
You make assumptions about them

516
00:24:44,456 --> 00:24:46,997
that are usually not based at looking at the driver.

517
00:24:47,017 --> 00:24:48,418
It's just how the car moves.

518
00:24:49,118 --> 00:24:51,439
So, like, what do you think about this driver?

519
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,282
In first-person games, how you move the camera

520
00:24:59,342 --> 00:25:00,803
and what you look at communicates

521
00:25:01,003 --> 00:25:02,063
the thoughts of the character.

522
00:25:02,664 --> 00:25:04,304
This is from one of my Firewatch trailers

523
00:25:04,344 --> 00:25:05,985
where I wanted to put you in Henry's head

524
00:25:06,785 --> 00:25:08,786
as he decides whether or not to throw the fireworks

525
00:25:08,846 --> 00:25:09,466
in the fire pit.

526
00:25:10,818 --> 00:25:17,665
Here's another example I made where Henry just kind of walks to the lake and then he

527
00:25:17,845 --> 00:25:25,753
picks up the boombox and then he looks at the teenagers and just walks to the side and

528
00:25:25,793 --> 00:25:30,278
he kind of thinks for a second and then he throws the boombox in the water and he just

529
00:25:30,298 --> 00:25:32,980
kind of backs away without breaking eye contact.

530
00:25:33,807 --> 00:25:36,167
which, like, based on this, what kind of person

531
00:25:36,187 --> 00:25:37,168
do you think this Henry is?

532
00:25:38,128 --> 00:25:40,789
Whereas in this version, this Henry is just

533
00:25:41,049 --> 00:25:43,229
like a total spaz, it just runs in

534
00:25:43,249 --> 00:25:46,630
and then grabs the boombox and then throws it in the water.

535
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:49,531
It doesn't even wait for it to fall in, it just runs away.

536
00:25:50,352 --> 00:25:52,852
So you can see how different the capture is

537
00:25:52,892 --> 00:25:54,933
just from changing the speed that the player moves

538
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,453
and performs their actions.

539
00:25:58,649 --> 00:26:00,270
Here's another example from Spelunky.

540
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:03,312
Here I'm just playing quickly and recklessly

541
00:26:03,912 --> 00:26:06,734
and get into some very typical Spelunky moments.

542
00:26:09,856 --> 00:26:11,977
And in this version I just played very slowly

543
00:26:12,177 --> 00:26:14,178
as if I didn't have much experience playing it.

544
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,400
And the game looks very different

545
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,660
depending on how you play it.

546
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,362
These two approaches communicate

547
00:26:20,442 --> 00:26:21,723
very differently to the audience.

548
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,842
And here's another example from Firewatch.

549
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:29,064
In the game, you can easily select dialogue options

550
00:26:29,104 --> 00:26:32,086
while walking, but in this clip, which I'll play in a sec,

551
00:26:32,927 --> 00:26:36,410
it changed up my movement to just give the performance

552
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,410
a little more character.

553
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:41,854
Yeah, I'm not sure I got a lot of choice

554
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:42,734
in getting struck down.

555
00:26:43,215 --> 00:26:46,157
Especially not with your electric personality.

556
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,902
I see my joke did not spark your sense of humor.

557
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:55,964
UGH!

558
00:26:56,424 --> 00:26:57,525
What, you're not enjoying our...

559
00:26:57,946 --> 00:26:59,567
CURRENT conversation?

560
00:27:01,869 --> 00:27:02,890
Oh my God, lady!

561
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,712
The... the arc of our budding friendship.

562
00:27:08,034 --> 00:27:10,956
They put the entire wilderness in the hands of an insane person.

563
00:27:11,016 --> 00:27:12,377
How exactly are you in charge?

564
00:27:13,778 --> 00:27:15,340
Ah, charge, Henry.

565
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:16,790
You get the point.

566
00:27:18,131 --> 00:27:20,333
This isn't to say that you need to think of character

567
00:27:20,373 --> 00:27:22,915
and emotion for every single thing that you capture.

568
00:27:23,055 --> 00:27:26,358
Sometimes you just want to show competently done gameplay.

569
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:29,400
But if you're even just doing that,

570
00:27:30,841 --> 00:27:34,864
capture one idea at a time and then build on that.

571
00:27:35,505 --> 00:27:37,246
You pick one action, intent, or emotion,

572
00:27:37,686 --> 00:27:38,667
find the best way to show it.

573
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,992
And then I have some more recommended viewing,

574
00:27:42,692 --> 00:27:45,915
which is this episode of Every Frame a Painting

575
00:27:46,095 --> 00:27:49,158
by Tony Jo called The Spielberg One-er,

576
00:27:49,699 --> 00:27:52,141
which is about how Steven Spielberg does long shots

577
00:27:52,181 --> 00:27:54,163
that are essentially multiple shots in one,

578
00:27:54,544 --> 00:27:56,786
which game capture can be like that sometimes.

579
00:27:58,688 --> 00:28:01,789
Another tip, which is controllers are best for slow movement.

580
00:28:02,689 --> 00:28:06,750
I have an Xbox Elite controller for the games where I want to be

581
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:11,091
constantly adjusting the camera with my thumbs, but I still need to press the face buttons.

582
00:28:11,871 --> 00:28:16,172
So for example, it's useful in shots like this one for the Wild Eternal trailer,

583
00:28:16,212 --> 00:28:20,894
where I'm moving alongside this marker, and I wanted to activate it while I was moving it.

584
00:28:22,114 --> 00:28:26,635
And then the downside of a controller, of course, is that it's difficult to do fast camera movements.

585
00:28:27,355 --> 00:28:30,938
which is what keyboard and mouse is good for

586
00:28:31,198 --> 00:28:33,820
because sometimes you want quick and fast movements.

587
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,542
For example, I used keyboard and mouse

588
00:28:37,802 --> 00:28:39,523
in the opening shot of Firewatch's trailer

589
00:28:39,543 --> 00:28:42,425
because I really wanted to be able to spin around

590
00:28:42,505 --> 00:28:44,807
very quickly for when Henry says,

591
00:28:45,067 --> 00:28:46,208
seriously, it's totally fine in here.

592
00:28:46,948 --> 00:28:49,190
Just to make it funnier, hopefully.

593
00:28:50,471 --> 00:28:52,372
These are just a lot of the takes that I did

594
00:28:52,712 --> 00:28:54,093
in the process of making the trailer.

595
00:28:55,914 --> 00:28:56,114
And then.

596
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,442
The downside of keyboard and mouse is that you can't

597
00:28:59,502 --> 00:29:01,344
vary your walking speed unless you have

598
00:29:01,684 --> 00:29:02,786
speed settings for movement.

599
00:29:04,528 --> 00:29:05,589
Next performance tip.

600
00:29:07,111 --> 00:29:08,993
Use a metronome or a metronome app

601
00:29:09,353 --> 00:29:11,816
when timing and choreographing multiple actions.

602
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:14,359
This is especially good when you wanna synchronize

603
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:15,801
movements to the beat of your music.

604
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,343
This is something I did for my Cosmic Trip trailer.

605
00:29:19,944 --> 00:29:21,727
By using a metronome set to the tempo

606
00:29:21,747 --> 00:29:23,330
of the trailer's music, I could just add

607
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,914
some visual interest by having the capture

608
00:29:25,934 --> 00:29:27,937
and music in sync, which I'll play right now.

609
00:29:49,846 --> 00:29:52,068
Another solution I've used is just loop the trailer music

610
00:29:52,088 --> 00:29:53,469
in the background while I'm capturing.

611
00:29:53,489 --> 00:29:58,012
All right, moving on to debug tools for capture.

612
00:29:58,032 --> 00:30:00,834
A lot of these are about saving time,

613
00:30:01,014 --> 00:30:02,375
but they're also about the ability

614
00:30:02,455 --> 00:30:04,376
to capture a wide variety of shots.

615
00:30:05,477 --> 00:30:08,158
And I'm not saying you must implement all of these,

616
00:30:08,258 --> 00:30:11,421
because obviously time and resources are a finite thing,

617
00:30:11,981 --> 00:30:14,042
but I just want to show you what's worked best for me

618
00:30:14,182 --> 00:30:14,463
and why.

619
00:30:16,055 --> 00:30:20,418
Think about this stuff early, especially if you're planning on lots of developer updates

620
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:24,220
or having someone else do your own capture or trailer work, hint hint.

621
00:30:25,761 --> 00:30:29,383
Just to give you an idea of what a difference a nice debug camera makes, here's a trailer

622
00:30:29,423 --> 00:30:33,486
I made for Ooblets and a version I made without using the debug camera.

623
00:31:29,785 --> 00:31:31,487
Also, the one on the left was an older build,

624
00:31:31,547 --> 00:31:33,829
and you will not be able to get that many ooblets

625
00:31:33,869 --> 00:31:36,172
at one time next to you.

626
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,053
I think it's like 10.

627
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:41,137
Anyway, so I'm gonna start with what I consider

628
00:31:41,157 --> 00:31:44,040
the essential time-saving debug tools.

629
00:31:44,521 --> 00:31:46,843
Some of these might already be implemented

630
00:31:46,903 --> 00:31:49,006
for making the game, but just in case.

631
00:31:50,352 --> 00:31:52,954
Number one thing you need is the ability to turn off the HUD.

632
00:31:53,834 --> 00:31:55,936
On-screen text or any overlays.

633
00:31:56,016 --> 00:31:58,377
I'm still surprised at how many trailers out there

634
00:31:58,478 --> 00:31:59,118
have the HUD on.

635
00:31:59,218 --> 00:32:02,580
It's very distracting, especially anything with text.

636
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,962
Like, you ever try not reading subtitles?

637
00:32:05,802 --> 00:32:08,284
This is especially important for button prompts

638
00:32:08,364 --> 00:32:11,086
because if you have a cross-platform game,

639
00:32:11,266 --> 00:32:13,607
you don't want to have to capture multiple times

640
00:32:13,727 --> 00:32:15,648
or digitally add in button prompts,

641
00:32:15,788 --> 00:32:18,510
which yes, I worked at places that had to do that

642
00:32:19,131 --> 00:32:20,411
and sometimes motion track it.

643
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,997
The way I think of the HUD in Game Capture is,

644
00:32:24,717 --> 00:32:25,977
it's like when you're in a car

645
00:32:26,337 --> 00:32:28,038
and suddenly there's something on your windshield.

646
00:32:28,178 --> 00:32:30,798
It's so distracting, it feels invasive

647
00:32:30,878 --> 00:32:32,239
because you just can't look at it.

648
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,799
This is what I feel like you're doing to the audience

649
00:32:34,939 --> 00:32:35,599
when the HUD's on.

650
00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:38,140
So just have an option to turn it off

651
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,281
and everything will be good.

652
00:32:42,417 --> 00:32:48,460
Music toggle seems like an obvious thing, but I've worked on several games which didn't have an option to turn off the music.

653
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:54,323
This saves time because when making trailers if the music is mixed in you can't use any of the sound effects from that capture

654
00:32:54,343 --> 00:32:58,985
which means manually adding them in which can get very tedious and time-consuming.

655
00:32:59,925 --> 00:33:05,528
Also, if the game has nice audio panning this is an easy way to have it tied to the footage whereas doing it in post

656
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:06,468
requires extra work.

657
00:33:08,716 --> 00:33:13,839
Level skip just saves a ton of time going from place to place if you can just skip around to different levels

658
00:33:14,379 --> 00:33:15,619
Just by the press of a button

659
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,542
Related an option to teleport which is especially useful for big games

660
00:33:22,603 --> 00:33:24,464
Even when like flying around takes a long time

661
00:33:25,264 --> 00:33:31,407
Subnautica has a coordinate system that you can use to display your current position and then use a warp command

662
00:33:31,947 --> 00:33:33,048
To just go straight there

663
00:33:35,922 --> 00:33:41,305
level number display. I'm working on the Adventure Pals right now and in their menu they have a

664
00:33:41,325 --> 00:33:46,969
dev mode and one thing it turns on is the level number on the top right hand corner. It's super

665
00:33:47,049 --> 00:33:51,552
useful because I did a first pass of capture just to see what was in the game and because of

666
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:56,435
this label combined with the level skip ability, it's super easy to just go back and redo a shot.

667
00:33:58,755 --> 00:34:01,057
Inventory management, this is really important

668
00:34:01,077 --> 00:34:02,859
for games like Ooblets and Dead Cells,

669
00:34:02,899 --> 00:34:04,181
which have lots of objects in them.

670
00:34:04,841 --> 00:34:07,404
It meant I could do a lot of customizing

671
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:10,647
and also tailor-mix scenarios to capture for the trailer.

672
00:34:11,548 --> 00:34:13,630
Dead Cells in particular had a really good system

673
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,752
because it let me spawn any item in the game

674
00:34:16,273 --> 00:34:18,816
in any iteration and change its modifiers.

675
00:34:21,104 --> 00:34:23,325
Spawn enemy, another nice tool for dead cells.

676
00:34:24,306 --> 00:34:26,427
Sometimes I wanted to do this because I just found

677
00:34:26,467 --> 00:34:28,688
a very aesthetically pleasing part of a level

678
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:31,670
and then needed to do multiple takes to get the shot right

679
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,591
without reloading the game every single time.

680
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:37,473
And if the game has procedurally generated levels,

681
00:34:37,734 --> 00:34:39,375
it might be even harder to redo a shot.

682
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,037
Invincibility, this is just to avoid

683
00:34:44,097 --> 00:34:45,578
having to restart the game all the time

684
00:34:45,638 --> 00:34:46,559
if it has a health system.

685
00:34:47,459 --> 00:34:47,699
Simple.

686
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:53,131
Fast mode, this is another mode I had for Octageddon,

687
00:34:53,171 --> 00:34:55,892
just the ability to make everything go super fast.

688
00:34:56,193 --> 00:34:58,894
This let me skip to different parts of a level very quickly.

689
00:34:58,914 --> 00:35:02,375
I also had that for Thimbleweed Park.

690
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:06,097
Tourist mode, another thing from Dead Cells.

691
00:35:06,817 --> 00:35:09,719
Similar fashion, just lets me walk past all the enemies,

692
00:35:09,819 --> 00:35:12,980
which is great for saving time and scouting out a level

693
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,361
to see which parts I want to capture.

694
00:35:16,987 --> 00:35:20,050
Cursor visibility, especially important for point-and-click adventure games.

695
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:23,512
There's really no reason in those trailers to ever see the cursor.

696
00:35:23,992 --> 00:35:28,255
But of course, in your capture, you still need to be able to activate objects and move around,

697
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:30,617
but so you need an option to make it invisible.

698
00:35:31,157 --> 00:35:35,641
In fact, when in Wajidai's Unavowed, I was working on that trailer,

699
00:35:35,661 --> 00:35:36,962
there was no option to hide the cursor.

700
00:35:37,362 --> 00:35:39,804
So I wanted the shot where you're choosing your party members.

701
00:35:40,064 --> 00:35:43,286
So I had to erase the cursor in After Effects by using a patchwork of clips.

702
00:35:44,107 --> 00:35:46,708
And if I just had the ability to turn off the cursor, it would have saved me hours.

703
00:35:47,509 --> 00:35:51,451
I put this GIF in my blog post about the trailer and Dave Gilbert, the creator, felt really

704
00:35:51,491 --> 00:35:53,713
bad when he found out I had to do all this.

705
00:35:57,015 --> 00:35:57,655
Object highlights.

706
00:35:58,416 --> 00:36:01,458
These are distracting because by their nature, they draw attention.

707
00:36:02,098 --> 00:36:06,641
And unless you're capturing for showcasing UI, there's really no reason to have it on.

708
00:36:09,181 --> 00:36:09,721
Time of day.

709
00:36:10,822 --> 00:36:12,222
If your game has a day-night cycle,

710
00:36:12,282 --> 00:36:13,723
this option makes it very easy

711
00:36:13,763 --> 00:36:15,843
to get a variety of shots very quickly.

712
00:36:18,424 --> 00:36:20,105
With Subnautica's time of day system,

713
00:36:20,165 --> 00:36:22,346
I could speed up the rate that the day went by

714
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:24,006
and then just slow it down

715
00:36:24,086 --> 00:36:26,127
when I found the pattern of light that I liked.

716
00:36:26,147 --> 00:36:30,428
All right, on to some genre specifics.

717
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:34,721
First-person games have their own unique needs.

718
00:36:34,962 --> 00:36:37,604
First thing you need specific to first-person games

719
00:36:38,645 --> 00:36:40,306
is head bob toggle.

720
00:36:41,287 --> 00:36:44,850
This is a very exaggerated example from Quadrilateral Cowboy.

721
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,231
Sometimes you want to use head bob

722
00:36:47,272 --> 00:36:49,173
to show the point of view of the protagonist,

723
00:36:49,253 --> 00:36:51,895
but other times you just want a smooth camera movement

724
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:54,858
showing the environment, so put a toggle for head bob.

725
00:36:57,393 --> 00:37:01,696
Other essential thing is a free cam, which can fly around freely, get shots of the

726
00:37:01,736 --> 00:37:06,600
environment and close-ups on objects, or just to get from one area to another, just

727
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:12,385
really quickly. This is especially important for trailers because it adds to the

728
00:37:12,805 --> 00:37:16,128
variety of possible shots, which opens up the ways you can tell the story.

729
00:37:19,806 --> 00:37:21,828
which standard first-person game controls

730
00:37:21,908 --> 00:37:23,729
are typically how free cams are mapped.

731
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:26,731
I usually request the ability to move up and down

732
00:37:26,772 --> 00:37:28,493
with the triggers since they're the only other

733
00:37:28,693 --> 00:37:31,455
analog controls available in addition to thumb sticks.

734
00:37:32,276 --> 00:37:34,518
But the most important thing about a free cam

735
00:37:35,318 --> 00:37:37,940
is that you optimize it for smooth movement.

736
00:37:38,641 --> 00:37:40,402
You basically want the camera controls

737
00:37:40,442 --> 00:37:43,385
to be the exact opposite of high fidelity,

738
00:37:43,585 --> 00:37:45,506
one-to-one, super precise controls.

739
00:37:46,627 --> 00:37:48,229
And this means things like

740
00:37:49,375 --> 00:37:50,435
adjustable camera speed.

741
00:37:51,756 --> 00:37:52,956
This isn't first person game,

742
00:37:52,996 --> 00:37:55,257
but I had a good system in Ooblets,

743
00:37:55,517 --> 00:37:58,177
which is most of the time I want slow camera moves,

744
00:37:58,237 --> 00:38:00,778
but sometimes it helps to be able to move really fast.

745
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:06,780
For example, on Subnautica, I could trigger an event,

746
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,841
and then press five, make the free cam move really quickly,

747
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:11,702
and just get into position,

748
00:38:12,202 --> 00:38:14,762
and then press a lower number to make the camera move slow

749
00:38:14,842 --> 00:38:15,683
as it captured the shot.

750
00:38:17,206 --> 00:38:19,928
And in terms of how to adjust these settings,

751
00:38:21,809 --> 00:38:25,372
sliders and hotkeys are the most user-friendly way

752
00:38:25,452 --> 00:38:27,734
to adjust camera speed and sensitivity.

753
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:31,697
Console commands are difficult because a setting of,

754
00:38:31,857 --> 00:38:35,099
say, one can be totally different game to game.

755
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,121
You know, it could be fast in one and slow in another.

756
00:38:39,022 --> 00:38:42,024
Next free cam tip is that dead zones are great.

757
00:38:42,959 --> 00:38:47,265
If you don't know, dead zones are just how far the thumbstick has to move before the input is read.

758
00:38:47,706 --> 00:38:49,869
This is to prevent sudden jerky movements,

759
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:53,394
and it allows for smoother camera transitions.

760
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:57,420
Another thing that helps is camera smoothing.

761
00:38:58,427 --> 00:39:00,628
I worked with Scott Goodrow on The Wild Eternal.

762
00:39:01,429 --> 00:39:04,811
And on that game, they had an option for camera smoothing,

763
00:39:04,871 --> 00:39:06,832
where the game averaged out the inputs

764
00:39:06,933 --> 00:39:08,213
within a certain time frame,

765
00:39:08,794 --> 00:39:11,276
and that made it easier for me to get nice, smooth movements.

766
00:39:11,756 --> 00:39:14,438
And the hardest thing in this shot was transitioning

767
00:39:14,478 --> 00:39:16,539
from using both sticks at the same time

768
00:39:16,999 --> 00:39:19,521
to only one for when I track in at the end.

769
00:39:20,042 --> 00:39:21,563
And camera smoothing helped a bunch.

770
00:39:23,624 --> 00:39:25,185
And the other thing I had for that game was

771
00:39:26,206 --> 00:39:28,707
a thumbstick sensitivity based on the stick's position.

772
00:39:30,528 --> 00:39:34,850
Basically, in the center of the radius of the movement

773
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,791
that the stick can go in, it's less sensitive,

774
00:39:36,971 --> 00:39:38,372
and further out it's more sensitive.

775
00:39:40,413 --> 00:39:42,554
All this just to say that I just wanted to be able

776
00:39:42,574 --> 00:39:45,916
to start the camera and move it, start it gradually,

777
00:39:46,236 --> 00:39:47,737
and then end the movement gradually,

778
00:39:48,218 --> 00:39:49,638
whereas usually just very sudden.

779
00:39:51,836 --> 00:39:54,458
Moving on to third person games.

780
00:39:55,279 --> 00:39:57,340
Camera controls here can get more complicated

781
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,881
because you have a character on screen

782
00:39:59,622 --> 00:40:02,144
and here's where I tell you just copy the tools

783
00:40:02,444 --> 00:40:04,946
that I had for Ooblets because it has the best options

784
00:40:05,146 --> 00:40:06,807
I've used for third person games so far.

785
00:40:07,608 --> 00:40:10,550
So in Ooblets, the camera is always in a fixed position

786
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,132
and follows the player character positionally.

787
00:40:13,152 --> 00:40:15,874
So moving left stick moves the character

788
00:40:16,094 --> 00:40:17,675
and the camera follows along.

789
00:40:19,403 --> 00:40:21,105
And then when the free cam mode is activated,

790
00:40:21,705 --> 00:40:24,547
the camera is still following the character positionally,

791
00:40:25,028 --> 00:40:27,429
but the triggers, bumpers, face buttons,

792
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:30,432
and right thumb stick can offset the position of the camera.

793
00:40:31,192 --> 00:40:34,455
And this let me get some great wide shots,

794
00:40:36,736 --> 00:40:38,197
and steady cam shots,

795
00:40:40,299 --> 00:40:41,780
and then side angle shots.

796
00:40:43,797 --> 00:40:45,518
And I could even adjust the camera while moving.

797
00:40:45,638 --> 00:40:46,919
So for example, in this shot,

798
00:40:47,459 --> 00:40:48,980
I am moving with the left thumb stick

799
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,661
and tracking in at the same time

800
00:40:51,761 --> 00:40:52,861
by holding the right trigger.

801
00:40:56,323 --> 00:40:58,564
And I could also rotate around the character while moving.

802
00:40:59,064 --> 00:41:00,465
And since the camera's always attached,

803
00:41:00,645 --> 00:41:02,325
I didn't have to worry about keeping track of them.

804
00:41:05,587 --> 00:41:06,367
And like I showed earlier,

805
00:41:06,387 --> 00:41:08,648
I could change the speed of the camera using hotkeys.

806
00:41:09,348 --> 00:41:11,109
And there were some nice pop-ups there

807
00:41:11,149 --> 00:41:13,390
that told me how much higher or lower the speed was.

808
00:41:16,019 --> 00:41:18,001
And then the other great camera option was the ability

809
00:41:18,121 --> 00:41:21,023
to detach the camera from the character by pressing Y.

810
00:41:21,424 --> 00:41:23,085
This meant I could lock the camera in place

811
00:41:23,425 --> 00:41:26,008
and move the character freely, which, for example,

812
00:41:26,968 --> 00:41:30,251
is what let me get these montages of the character

813
00:41:30,311 --> 00:41:33,874
decorating the house or planting crops.

814
00:41:37,075 --> 00:41:39,340
And another good option for third-person games

815
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,384
is a toggle for player visibility.

816
00:41:41,404 --> 00:41:43,549
This is good for when you need to capture shots

817
00:41:43,629 --> 00:41:45,533
of the environment or NPCs.

818
00:41:46,807 --> 00:41:48,868
And so one caveat to all this is that

819
00:41:49,008 --> 00:41:51,470
these camera controls worked great for Ooblets

820
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,711
because the player controls are just movement

821
00:41:53,991 --> 00:41:55,232
and interacting with the A button.

822
00:41:56,212 --> 00:41:58,313
The setup wouldn't work with a game like Uncharted

823
00:41:58,353 --> 00:41:59,834
where you're just using all the buttons

824
00:41:59,874 --> 00:42:00,855
to control the character,

825
00:42:01,295 --> 00:42:02,956
which the ideal scenario would be

826
00:42:03,516 --> 00:42:06,037
the ability to say offset the camera position,

827
00:42:06,598 --> 00:42:07,758
lock in those new settings,

828
00:42:08,138 --> 00:42:09,259
and then control the character

829
00:42:09,299 --> 00:42:10,620
from that position like normal.

830
00:42:12,064 --> 00:42:14,525
But actually another great example of a third-person game

831
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:19,185
with a great debug camera is the Mad Max game from 2015,

832
00:42:19,426 --> 00:42:21,606
which I worked on at an agency in Los Angeles.

833
00:42:22,626 --> 00:42:24,407
The capture team there actually captured everything

834
00:42:24,587 --> 00:42:26,847
in the trailer that I worked on using the retail version,

835
00:42:27,267 --> 00:42:28,667
which shipped with a video mode.

836
00:42:30,168 --> 00:42:31,548
If you hook up a second controller,

837
00:42:31,568 --> 00:42:34,108
that becomes the camera controls,

838
00:42:34,409 --> 00:42:36,129
which have all these additional options

839
00:42:36,229 --> 00:42:38,089
when the first controller plays as Max.

840
00:42:41,345 --> 00:42:44,407
So just like an Ooblets, the camera follows positionally,

841
00:42:44,988 --> 00:42:46,269
and you can reposition it.

842
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:49,811
Then just walk around.

843
00:42:52,493 --> 00:42:53,514
You can

844
00:43:00,158 --> 00:43:02,760
change the field of view, which, zoom.

845
00:43:08,344 --> 00:43:10,725
And then you can move the camera up and down.

846
00:43:17,593 --> 00:43:19,235
And then you could also detach the camera.

847
00:43:25,281 --> 00:43:28,324
And then there was also a button for slow motion,

848
00:43:28,525 --> 00:43:30,046
which we'll get to in a sec.

849
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:33,910
Come on.

850
00:43:34,992 --> 00:43:35,372
There you go.

851
00:43:37,154 --> 00:43:37,434
And then.

852
00:43:38,447 --> 00:43:40,228
There's an option to tilt the camera.

853
00:43:41,569 --> 00:43:44,870
And then you could also set up multiple camera angles,

854
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:46,451
which are switchable back and forth.

855
00:43:46,651 --> 00:43:49,333
And there are also toggle for depth of field and focus.

856
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:52,294
And all this you can either do by yourself

857
00:43:52,774 --> 00:43:56,396
or by moving the camera with one controller,

858
00:43:56,416 --> 00:43:58,157
then switching to the other one and playing.

859
00:43:58,617 --> 00:44:00,198
Or you could just do it with a partner,

860
00:44:00,258 --> 00:44:01,899
so the second person's the camera person.

861
00:44:03,225 --> 00:44:06,788
And the only thing that would have made this mode better are speed settings for the camera,

862
00:44:06,828 --> 00:44:09,130
because the default sensitivity was quite high.

863
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:13,814
But there are a lot of games now that have a photo mode, but this is the only AAA game

864
00:44:13,834 --> 00:44:17,878
that I can think of that has a video mode, which I'd love to see this sort of feature

865
00:44:17,918 --> 00:44:22,161
in more AAA games, especially if you find an elegant way to do it without requiring

866
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:22,962
a second controller.

867
00:44:25,742 --> 00:44:30,006
Debug tools for 2D games, which aren't as complicated

868
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:31,788
since you're only dealing with x and y axes,

869
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:33,490
but here are a couple things.

870
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:38,116
First is free cam mode, which not as important

871
00:44:38,136 --> 00:44:40,058
as in 3D games, but sometimes it's useful.

872
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:42,841
For example, in a trailer I made for Dead Cells,

873
00:44:42,941 --> 00:44:44,763
the free cam let me show off the new levels.

874
00:44:47,158 --> 00:44:49,741
And this one here is more of an idea of mine,

875
00:44:50,302 --> 00:44:52,765
which would only really work if the game assets scale

876
00:44:52,845 --> 00:44:54,988
better in game than in editing software.

877
00:44:55,528 --> 00:44:57,591
But if there was a way to have a debug camera

878
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:59,814
that allowed zooming and position offsetting,

879
00:44:59,874 --> 00:45:01,175
that would be a great thing to have.

880
00:45:02,036 --> 00:45:03,398
Again, only if the assets scale.

881
00:45:04,439 --> 00:45:06,081
I'm guessing this would work best with pixel art.

882
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:10,211
And lastly, here are some debug tool extras.

883
00:45:10,991 --> 00:45:13,291
Not essential, but they're handy tools to have.

884
00:45:13,672 --> 00:45:15,652
I mean, kittens are essential, but anyway.

885
00:45:16,552 --> 00:45:18,192
Just an excuse to have another kitten photo.

886
00:45:20,193 --> 00:45:20,893
NPC control.

887
00:45:21,953 --> 00:45:24,634
Watch at eyes game unavowed had a nice debug option

888
00:45:24,654 --> 00:45:26,974
where I could switch control to other characters

889
00:45:27,034 --> 00:45:28,074
and just move them around.

890
00:45:28,494 --> 00:45:30,035
This helped for when I wanted the characters

891
00:45:30,175 --> 00:45:31,555
in a certain arrangement on screen

892
00:45:31,575 --> 00:45:32,595
to make the composition better.

893
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:36,651
And like I said with Mad Max,

894
00:45:36,972 --> 00:45:38,293
camera attached to a second controller

895
00:45:38,313 --> 00:45:39,934
is great to have for a third person game.

896
00:45:40,435 --> 00:45:42,216
Just allows for much more dynamic shots.

897
00:45:43,177 --> 00:45:44,238
In the second trailer for Ooblets,

898
00:45:44,258 --> 00:45:47,181
I was able to move a camera via the keyboard and mouse

899
00:45:47,421 --> 00:45:49,763
while controlling the character with a game pad,

900
00:45:50,223 --> 00:45:52,325
which would have been easier with a second set of hands,

901
00:45:52,425 --> 00:45:55,228
but for this shot, I was literally just holding the game pad

902
00:45:55,608 --> 00:45:58,090
and then with a free finger just pressing forward

903
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:58,831
to move the camera.

904
00:46:00,342 --> 00:46:04,744
Having a separate controller act as a camera also helps immensely for 3D games that have co-op play.

905
00:46:05,224 --> 00:46:10,826
I've worked on games where getting shots of two players moving at once required some very hacky solutions.

906
00:46:11,526 --> 00:46:14,407
In that case having a third controller be the camera would be great.

907
00:46:15,948 --> 00:46:18,769
And another handy tool for 3D games is

908
00:46:18,889 --> 00:46:19,469
time freeze.

909
00:46:20,829 --> 00:46:23,631
This is really useful for 3D games with lots of action.

910
00:46:23,651 --> 00:46:26,074
It's just a button to freeze the action,

911
00:46:26,694 --> 00:46:28,716
let me reposition the camera to a new angle,

912
00:46:29,216 --> 00:46:30,437
and then resume the action.

913
00:46:30,697 --> 00:46:32,839
This saves a lot of time for when it might be hard

914
00:46:32,879 --> 00:46:34,881
to control a game at a certain angle,

915
00:46:35,461 --> 00:46:37,623
and then it's great for creating match cuts.

916
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,762
And then slow motion's sometimes nice to have,

917
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:45,203
but I'm usually wary of using it

918
00:46:45,283 --> 00:46:47,145
because if the game doesn't have some sort of

919
00:46:47,605 --> 00:46:48,746
slow motion bullet time mode,

920
00:46:48,766 --> 00:46:50,227
I don't want to misrepresent the game.

921
00:46:51,128 --> 00:46:53,029
But it can help make some cool shots

922
00:46:53,209 --> 00:46:55,591
or make it easier to perform a succession of shots

923
00:46:55,811 --> 00:46:57,953
and then maybe speed it back up to normal speed.

924
00:46:59,214 --> 00:47:01,315
For example, Sunhi Legend does a lot of these

925
00:47:01,536 --> 00:47:02,877
uncharted capture in slow motion,

926
00:47:02,937 --> 00:47:06,159
so it's easier to queue up things one after another

927
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:10,002
and react and then later sped it back to normal speed.

928
00:47:11,624 --> 00:47:14,165
And some games I've worked on let me control the time scale

929
00:47:14,185 --> 00:47:16,267
down to like a third or fourth decimal,

930
00:47:16,287 --> 00:47:18,628
but it's really not necessary to be that granular.

931
00:47:19,349 --> 00:47:21,430
If adding options for multiple time scales,

932
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:22,811
just whole numbers are better,

933
00:47:22,891 --> 00:47:25,393
so then that when you would set it back to normal speed

934
00:47:25,433 --> 00:47:27,535
in editing software, it's simple to do.

935
00:47:29,436 --> 00:47:32,058
And next, I'm just gonna talk, that's a good one.

936
00:47:33,539 --> 00:47:34,399
Gonna talk a little bit about VR.

937
00:47:36,454 --> 00:47:39,035
just briefly, because really what you should do is

938
00:47:39,335 --> 00:47:41,956
go to fellow trailer maker Kurt Gartner's website.

939
00:47:41,996 --> 00:47:43,816
He has an entire talk that he did earlier this week

940
00:47:43,856 --> 00:47:45,557
about capturing footage for VR games.

941
00:47:46,657 --> 00:47:48,378
And his website has an in-depth article

942
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:50,899
about virtual cinematography for VR trailers.

943
00:47:51,559 --> 00:47:53,359
And in his talk he has a slide where he says,

944
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:56,960
your head is not a camera, because using footage

945
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,421
of only the first person view

946
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:00,341
isn't the best way to show VR games.

947
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:05,503
And I agree that having the option to show an avatar playing the games in VR

948
00:48:05,964 --> 00:48:09,787
is the best way to go because just like having a free cam for first-person games,

949
00:48:10,408 --> 00:48:13,050
an alternate angle just gives you more options for interesting shots,

950
00:48:13,751 --> 00:48:14,472
especially in VR.

951
00:48:15,773 --> 00:48:20,237
All that said, if you have to do first-person VR capture, here are some tips.

952
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:24,396
Implement motion smoothing on the external monitor.

953
00:48:24,616 --> 00:48:27,058
I'm still amazed at how many trailers for VR games

954
00:48:27,158 --> 00:48:28,198
don't have motion smoothing.

955
00:48:28,718 --> 00:48:30,199
It looks terrible, it's shaky,

956
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:31,980
and it might make your audience sick

957
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:32,901
just from looking at it.

958
00:48:33,321 --> 00:48:34,522
I once had to work on a VR game

959
00:48:34,542 --> 00:48:35,943
where there's no motion smoothing,

960
00:48:36,063 --> 00:48:38,404
and I just got nauseated just from going through footage.

961
00:48:39,939 --> 00:48:41,220
So if the footage is smooth,

962
00:48:41,821 --> 00:48:43,162
then the audience can simply focus on

963
00:48:43,222 --> 00:48:44,283
what's happening in the shot.

964
00:48:44,944 --> 00:48:46,786
And everything will just look much better.

965
00:48:47,687 --> 00:48:49,649
And also with a motion smooth camera,

966
00:48:50,249 --> 00:48:52,852
just make sure it doesn't break all your filters and effects

967
00:48:53,152 --> 00:48:54,053
which is something I've noticed.

968
00:48:55,774 --> 00:48:59,018
Next tip is use the eye that corresponds

969
00:48:59,078 --> 00:49:00,399
to the PC monitor window.

970
00:49:01,374 --> 00:49:03,516
The window that displays on your PC when in VR

971
00:49:03,836 --> 00:49:05,998
usually is signal from the right or left eye,

972
00:49:06,098 --> 00:49:08,681
so naturally you should only be using that eye

973
00:49:08,721 --> 00:49:09,341
when capturing.

974
00:49:09,662 --> 00:49:12,905
Otherwise, the footage might be at a slight angle

975
00:49:12,925 --> 00:49:13,706
when you're lining it up,

976
00:49:14,707 --> 00:49:16,048
which is especially obvious when you're trying

977
00:49:16,068 --> 00:49:18,290
to do something like aim down the sight of a gun.

978
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:20,833
So that's with the right eye, not the left one.

979
00:49:24,983 --> 00:49:29,357
Next is find the center of your view. If you're just capturing by yourself, you have to do

980
00:49:29,377 --> 00:49:31,624
some extra work to make sure everything is composed well.

981
00:49:33,151 --> 00:49:35,532
And in VR, a lot of the time, you can feel like you've,

982
00:49:36,072 --> 00:49:37,493
you're centered something in your view,

983
00:49:37,653 --> 00:49:40,475
but you're actually looking too high or too low

984
00:49:40,615 --> 00:49:41,895
or too much to the side.

985
00:49:42,576 --> 00:49:44,837
In this capture, I didn't have any guide for the center,

986
00:49:44,997 --> 00:49:46,738
but it felt like things were centered.

987
00:49:47,338 --> 00:49:50,599
But it turns out I'm mostly looking a little bit too high.

988
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,241
And the best way I found to center my view

989
00:49:54,141 --> 00:49:57,242
is to put a sticky on the lens of the monitor eye.

990
00:49:58,383 --> 00:50:01,890
I just start by putting it on the eye and then just do some test capture where I look

991
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:05,858
at something and if it's not centered then I just adjust the position until it's good.

992
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,646
Takes some trial and error but makes things way easier once you do it.

993
00:50:11,486 --> 00:50:13,408
Next, be aware of hand position.

994
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:17,852
You can play most VR games with your hands in a position

995
00:50:17,913 --> 00:50:20,075
that an external monitor will just never see.

996
00:50:21,336 --> 00:50:22,918
So if you want the controllers to be visible,

997
00:50:23,078 --> 00:50:25,901
you have to test to see how high they should be.

998
00:50:27,242 --> 00:50:29,024
Most of the time it will feel really unnatural

999
00:50:29,044 --> 00:50:31,386
to hold your hands so high, but it'll look better

1000
00:50:31,426 --> 00:50:33,088
if you want the audience to see the controllers.

1001
00:50:33,971 --> 00:50:35,611
Whereas you see in the right screen,

1002
00:50:35,731 --> 00:50:38,152
I was just holding my hands in a very comfortable position

1003
00:50:38,592 --> 00:50:40,753
and you can see I can play the game just fine

1004
00:50:40,853 --> 00:50:43,253
but everything isn't as clear as on the left version.

1005
00:50:45,774 --> 00:50:47,054
And capture with a partner.

1006
00:50:47,074 --> 00:50:50,235
All the previous tips were capturing alone

1007
00:50:50,295 --> 00:50:52,116
but having a capture partner is ideal

1008
00:50:52,156 --> 00:50:54,636
because they can tell you if you're looking

1009
00:50:54,656 --> 00:50:55,476
at the right thing or not.

1010
00:50:57,277 --> 00:50:58,417
Also mind the mouse cursor.

1011
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:03,586
is just make sure the mouse is in a place

1012
00:51:03,686 --> 00:51:04,767
that it's not on the monitor,

1013
00:51:04,947 --> 00:51:08,390
and maybe it is in a place where it can be nudged by cats,

1014
00:51:09,211 --> 00:51:09,992
because that can happen.

1015
00:51:12,554 --> 00:51:13,815
Yeah, just save you some time there.

1016
00:51:15,016 --> 00:51:17,358
Also, hire someone with physical training

1017
00:51:17,438 --> 00:51:19,500
to do your capture, like a professional dancer

1018
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:20,341
or a martial artist,

1019
00:51:20,921 --> 00:51:23,003
or someone who's just very good with their hands.

1020
00:51:23,103 --> 00:51:25,525
It's easier for them to repeat choreography,

1021
00:51:25,605 --> 00:51:26,586
make graceful motions,

1022
00:51:26,986 --> 00:51:28,948
and they probably won't get tired very quickly.

1023
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:32,500
Performance in VR is just so much more important

1024
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,421
because every little head and hand movement,

1025
00:51:34,461 --> 00:51:37,103
scene one to one, it's very easy for the performance

1026
00:51:37,123 --> 00:51:39,124
to have no energy or flow.

1027
00:51:39,264 --> 00:51:42,426
So get a dancer or martial artist, makes a big difference.

1028
00:51:44,647 --> 00:51:46,187
And make a free cam for your VR game.

1029
00:51:46,668 --> 00:51:48,149
More shot variety makes the footage

1030
00:51:48,209 --> 00:51:49,549
just much more fun to watch.

1031
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:51,970
So whatever you can do to create more shots

1032
00:51:51,991 --> 00:51:54,672
that aren't from the first person's perspective, do it.

1033
00:51:54,692 --> 00:51:56,133
All right.

1034
00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:02,925
So capture practice. Here's some great games if you want to practice capturing. Disclaimer, not

1035
00:52:02,945 --> 00:52:08,049
being paid by anyone here, but I did work on trailers for all these games. Like I said

1036
00:52:08,069 --> 00:52:14,255
before, the Mad Max game, great for third person game capture practice. So get this if you

1037
00:52:14,275 --> 00:52:15,576
want to practice for that.

1038
00:52:17,591 --> 00:52:19,912
First person games, Quadrilateral Cowboy, great,

1039
00:52:20,052 --> 00:52:22,414
because using a free cam's part of the game.

1040
00:52:22,434 --> 00:52:24,455
You have to enter some commands

1041
00:52:24,515 --> 00:52:25,776
to be able to use a controller,

1042
00:52:25,836 --> 00:52:27,457
but since it's a game about hacking,

1043
00:52:27,937 --> 00:52:29,838
the debug console is still in the game

1044
00:52:29,918 --> 00:52:32,440
as an option in the settings, because of course it is.

1045
00:52:33,861 --> 00:52:35,442
These are the instructions for what you need

1046
00:52:35,482 --> 00:52:36,463
to set up the free cam,

1047
00:52:36,483 --> 00:52:39,405
it's just some things you have to punch into the console,

1048
00:52:39,805 --> 00:52:40,665
and then you can use the controller.

1049
00:52:42,126 --> 00:52:43,747
Also in the console, you can just type find,

1050
00:52:43,967 --> 00:52:45,328
and find lots of other commands, which.

1051
00:52:45,933 --> 00:52:47,774
I'm sure the creator of the game would love for you to do.

1052
00:52:47,794 --> 00:52:49,635
I actually mean that.

1053
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:52,656
But yeah, so then the game, you just press F1

1054
00:52:53,156 --> 00:52:54,917
and you got a free cam, you can just turn it on and off.

1055
00:52:56,017 --> 00:52:56,618
And you can practice.

1056
00:52:58,338 --> 00:53:02,300
Also, Tacoma, fantastic for practicing framing NPCs

1057
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:03,540
in a first person camera.

1058
00:53:04,617 --> 00:53:07,599
because the game is all about having these scenes

1059
00:53:07,639 --> 00:53:09,540
that play out and then just rewinding them

1060
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,862
so you can just easily try different angles

1061
00:53:12,162 --> 00:53:14,143
over and over and over and over again.

1062
00:53:14,223 --> 00:53:16,004
This is just some of my raw capture

1063
00:53:16,024 --> 00:53:17,986
from when I was trying to get this shot for the trailer.

1064
00:53:19,246 --> 00:53:21,008
Next to Ooblets and Quadrilateral Cowboy,

1065
00:53:21,028 --> 00:53:22,989
Tacoma's just the easiest game to capture for.

1066
00:53:23,009 --> 00:53:27,972
Another fun thing you can do is...

1067
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:30,974
Oops, sorry.

1068
00:53:31,254 --> 00:53:32,755
I thought I turned the volume down on that one.

1069
00:53:33,616 --> 00:53:34,016
Doop-a-doo.

1070
00:53:37,686 --> 00:53:39,387
All right, another fun thing you can do in Tacoma

1071
00:53:39,888 --> 00:53:41,869
is treat it like a virtual film set

1072
00:53:42,049 --> 00:53:43,691
and practice editing scenes together.

1073
00:53:44,031 --> 00:53:46,373
This is just one I made just very quickly for this talk,

1074
00:53:46,933 --> 00:53:48,455
but it made me want to do more.

1075
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:54,519
All right, capture inspiration.

1076
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,601
Some good examples of video game

1077
00:53:56,661 --> 00:53:58,463
and film resources for inspiration.

1078
00:54:00,093 --> 00:54:04,498
Other Places by Andy Kelly, which is all about showing pretty environments in video games.

1079
00:54:05,299 --> 00:54:08,543
Unfortunately, he doesn't update anymore, but there's still a lot of great videos on

1080
00:54:08,583 --> 00:54:09,324
his YouTube channel.

1081
00:54:12,167 --> 00:54:15,271
At SoonHeLegend on Twitter posts amazing animated GIFs.

1082
00:54:15,531 --> 00:54:17,974
I already showed a whole bunch in this talk.

1083
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:19,035
Right now he's on Monster Hunter.

1084
00:54:24,834 --> 00:54:28,156
Next, oh, and Rebecca Cordingly's Twitter for oobletsgifs.

1085
00:54:28,656 --> 00:54:29,957
She's at nonplayercat.

1086
00:54:30,437 --> 00:54:32,999
Her development gifs are always lots of fun to look at.

1087
00:54:37,801 --> 00:54:39,602
Compositioncam is a Instagram account,

1088
00:54:39,963 --> 00:54:43,264
also not updated anymore, but they overlay grids and lines

1089
00:54:43,324 --> 00:54:45,866
to show how a lot of great shots from films are composed.

1090
00:54:49,588 --> 00:54:52,289
And at oneperfectshot tweets shots from films

1091
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:53,750
and articles about film.

1092
00:54:55,822 --> 00:55:00,325
Okay, so in summary, think about capture early.

1093
00:55:00,345 --> 00:55:02,466
The sooner you think about how your game looks

1094
00:55:02,506 --> 00:55:03,387
in video, the better.

1095
00:55:04,027 --> 00:55:05,088
Helps you market your game,

1096
00:55:05,408 --> 00:55:07,069
and it might even help you with the game's design.

1097
00:55:09,111 --> 00:55:10,752
Watch films with great cinematography,

1098
00:55:10,892 --> 00:55:12,593
good visual flow, and camera moves.

1099
00:55:13,293 --> 00:55:15,975
Not saying your shots have to rival Hollywood directors,

1100
00:55:16,035 --> 00:55:19,377
but might inspire you to, or give you some good ideas.

1101
00:55:21,983 --> 00:55:23,244
Watch films with great framing.

1102
00:55:23,704 --> 00:55:24,624
There are a lot of great directors,

1103
00:55:24,705 --> 00:55:26,245
but just start with Kurosawa.

1104
00:55:26,566 --> 00:55:28,527
Like, just watch all the Kurosawa films.

1105
00:55:29,047 --> 00:55:29,567
It's amazing.

1106
00:55:31,609 --> 00:55:33,170
Watch films with well-shot action.

1107
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:37,172
You know, good blocking, good spatial awareness in editing.

1108
00:55:37,232 --> 00:55:38,593
So watch Jackie Chan films.

1109
00:55:38,653 --> 00:55:41,235
Watch Yuen Woo-Ping choreographed films.

1110
00:55:41,335 --> 00:55:44,376
John Wick, Edgar Wright films, Guillermo del Toro.

1111
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:49,651
Give yourself the tools to create great shots.

1112
00:55:50,151 --> 00:55:52,491
Without good tools, just making it harder for everyone.

1113
00:55:54,732 --> 00:55:56,012
Think of yourself as a puppeteer.

1114
00:55:56,032 --> 00:55:59,173
Again, game capture isn't simply playing,

1115
00:55:59,213 --> 00:56:00,194
it's a performance.

1116
00:56:02,474 --> 00:56:03,494
Capture with intention.

1117
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:05,835
Think about what the intent of each shot is

1118
00:56:06,295 --> 00:56:08,396
and how to best achieve that visually.

1119
00:56:10,842 --> 00:56:12,543
And really, simplify your shots.

1120
00:56:12,884 --> 00:56:14,485
It makes them much more readable.

1121
00:56:14,665 --> 00:56:17,026
So strip away anything inessential.

1122
00:56:17,426 --> 00:56:21,109
And I'll leave you with some good advice from Jackie Chan.

1123
00:56:21,889 --> 00:56:26,252
The most difficult thing is when I throw the fan

1124
00:56:26,492 --> 00:56:30,295
and coming back for one shot, more than 120 tick.

1125
00:56:30,815 --> 00:56:32,996
When you see it in two minute or one second,

1126
00:56:33,097 --> 00:56:34,117
if, oh, Jackie, good.

1127
00:56:34,277 --> 00:56:34,778
It's not good.

1128
00:56:34,918 --> 00:56:35,438
You can do it.

1129
00:56:35,778 --> 00:56:37,940
Except do you have the patience or not?

1130
00:56:39,725 --> 00:56:46,647
And that's it. Thank you for coming. Uh, follow me on Twitter. Talk about trailers and post lots

1131
00:56:46,687 --> 00:56:51,529
of cat photos on my website. I write about trailers I make. I also have a page with trailer

1132
00:56:51,549 --> 00:56:56,011
submission specs for all the consoles and a weekly newsletter where I talk about movie and game

1133
00:56:56,031 --> 00:57:01,353
trailers. And also please fill out your session evaluation forms. Do we have time for

1134
00:57:01,473 --> 00:57:07,275
questions? Five? Four? Alright. If anyone has questions.

1135
00:57:10,585 --> 00:57:10,808
Hello.

1136
00:57:10,828 --> 00:57:11,316
Hi.

1137
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:17,834
Can you talk a little bit about interesting trailers for UI driven games?

1138
00:57:17,974 --> 00:57:21,235
Like maybe card games or visual novels, things like that?

1139
00:57:21,415 --> 00:57:21,635
Right.

1140
00:57:21,915 --> 00:57:27,337
There are really, what I try to do, so I did a trailer for Lady Killer in a Bind, which

1141
00:57:27,357 --> 00:57:33,198
is a visual novel, and what I did was, I actually kind of recreated the game's UI in After Effects

1142
00:57:33,238 --> 00:57:36,119
in that case, just so I could take out the parts that I didn't want.

1143
00:57:37,259 --> 00:57:40,540
So if you can find a way to take out the parts that aren't important in the shot, that's

1144
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:41,360
something I would recommend.

1145
00:57:43,269 --> 00:57:48,574
Yeah, just taking stuff out usually. And then if there's like text, just really stripping down

1146
00:57:48,614 --> 00:57:54,060
the text, rewriting it, whatever. Just make it so then that the reading is part of the

1147
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:58,003
trailer. It's not like text that you can tell that's not meant to be read when you're

1148
00:57:58,023 --> 00:57:58,344
watching it.

1149
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:00,610
Yes?

1150
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:01,130
Hello.

1151
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:03,873
I also do trailers, and it was great to see your talk

1152
00:58:03,933 --> 00:58:06,075
and validated a lot of the stuff that we do as well.

1153
00:58:06,836 --> 00:58:08,938
But I just wanted to ask, you talk a lot about capturing,

1154
00:58:08,958 --> 00:58:10,380
but not so much on the editing side.

1155
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,762
If you were starting a blank canvas,

1156
00:58:12,802 --> 00:58:14,744
you made a whole new trailer from scratch,

1157
00:58:15,165 --> 00:58:15,985
what's your first step?

1158
00:58:16,025 --> 00:58:17,046
Do you do music first?

1159
00:58:17,067 --> 00:58:18,308
Do you do narrative stuff first?

1160
00:58:18,548 --> 00:58:21,410
So question is about first step to start editing a trailer.

1161
00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:23,591
It depends, if it's like dialogue driven,

1162
00:58:23,672 --> 00:58:24,672
I'll start with a dialogue,

1163
00:58:24,752 --> 00:58:26,754
like give me the whole crap ton of dialogue,

1164
00:58:27,234 --> 00:58:29,436
and then I'll figure out that first, do the dialogue,

1165
00:58:29,876 --> 00:58:32,598
and then next is music, and then the shots.

1166
00:58:33,298 --> 00:58:38,462
So usually the, but music first is usually what I want.

1167
00:58:38,562 --> 00:58:41,384
I want it to sound like a trailer as soon as possible,

1168
00:58:41,404 --> 00:58:43,645
otherwise it's just agonizing to work on.

1169
00:58:43,866 --> 00:58:44,726
Absolutely, all right, thank you.

1170
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:46,240
Yes.

1171
00:58:46,581 --> 00:58:47,442
Hey.

1172
00:58:48,063 --> 00:58:50,487
So obviously I'm sure debug tools are one of the things

1173
00:58:50,507 --> 00:58:52,850
you ask for, but what's a list of assets?

1174
00:58:53,171 --> 00:58:56,095
Or do you ask for specific images in a certain way?

1175
00:58:56,295 --> 00:58:57,658
The original audio?

1176
00:58:57,678 --> 00:59:00,883
Or do you just get into the game and take what

1177
00:59:00,903 --> 00:59:01,423
you get from there?

1178
00:59:01,723 --> 00:59:04,905
Yeah, the question, so what assets do you need for a trailer to get started?

1179
00:59:05,525 --> 00:59:10,868
Usually you say like a build, the music files, sometimes sound effects.

1180
00:59:10,888 --> 00:59:14,050
If it's a game with a lot of sound effects that are playing all at the same time

1181
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:17,372
and I want to be able to just pick specific ones, I'll usually ask for sound effects.

1182
00:59:17,933 --> 00:59:19,554
And then maybe like graphic design stuff.

1183
00:59:19,674 --> 00:59:21,155
And then we have time for one more question.

1184
00:59:22,816 --> 00:59:25,457
Is there a rule of thumb for the length the trailer should be?

1185
00:59:25,477 --> 00:59:27,218
Like a lot of them seem to be 30 seconds.

1186
00:59:27,818 --> 00:59:30,239
Yeah, I mean, generally game trailers tend to be 90 seconds

1187
00:59:30,999 --> 00:59:31,399
or fewer.

1188
00:59:32,379 --> 00:59:34,920
But really, a lot of it's just the editing, too.

1189
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:38,301
Like, you can make a trailer that is 30 seconds long,

1190
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:41,202
but if the editing's bad, it just feels like forever.

1191
00:59:41,322 --> 00:59:43,203
Whereas you can have one that could be very snappy,

1192
00:59:43,243 --> 00:59:44,683
but it's a minute and a half.

1193
00:59:45,244 --> 00:59:48,265
So I usually just say, it's just as long as it needs to be.

1194
00:59:48,785 --> 00:59:51,006
But everything is better when it's shorter, usually.

1195
00:59:51,026 --> 00:59:52,886
Thank you.

1196
00:59:53,286 --> 00:59:54,707
All right, if anyone has more questions,

1197
00:59:54,767 --> 00:59:55,727
I can meet you outside.

1198
00:59:56,547 --> 00:59:57,408
Thank you for coming again.
