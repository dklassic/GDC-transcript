1
00:00:16,275 --> 00:00:21,358
New Orleans, a modern city with traditional southern values.

2
00:00:21,518 --> 00:00:25,021
I'm asking me how far he was going to go.

3
00:00:26,502 --> 00:00:27,663
What he was willing to do.

4
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:30,524
This is the city that survived the war in 1812.

5
00:00:30,585 --> 00:00:34,447
The Civil War and God knows how many hurricanes.

6
00:00:34,907 --> 00:00:43,033
But when Lincoln declared one after the war, he inflicted more damage than all wars and hurricanes combined.

7
00:00:50,825 --> 00:00:52,706
Good morning, everyone. Welcome. Thank you for coming along.

8
00:00:53,266 --> 00:00:56,427
My name is Matt Bauer. I'm the audio director for Hangar 13.

9
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:59,568
We are a studio within 2K Games,

10
00:01:00,368 --> 00:01:01,968
head by Hayden Blackman.

11
00:01:02,728 --> 00:01:04,649
Our audio team consists of myself,

12
00:01:05,709 --> 00:01:08,070
two junior sound designers, two senior sound designers.

13
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:11,210
Our engineering needs kind of fluctuated up and down a little bit,

14
00:01:12,171 --> 00:01:14,751
from one person part-time to three people,

15
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:17,912
and some really great external contractors that we worked with.

16
00:01:19,597 --> 00:01:23,199
If you're not familiar with the game Mafia 3, I'll just walk you through it very briefly.

17
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,861
It's an open world third person cover shooter.

18
00:01:26,042 --> 00:01:27,563
It's set in the town of New Bordeaux.

19
00:01:28,123 --> 00:01:30,565
That's our fictionalized version of New Orleans in 1968.

20
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:33,367
It's the story of Lincoln Clay.

21
00:01:33,587 --> 00:01:34,908
He is a man of mixed race.

22
00:01:35,168 --> 00:01:35,809
He's an orphan.

23
00:01:36,309 --> 00:01:37,270
He's a Vietnam vet.

24
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:43,414
And he's returned home from the war to find that his surrogate family, the black mob,

25
00:01:43,975 --> 00:01:45,776
are deeply indebted to the Italian mob.

26
00:01:48,047 --> 00:01:55,291
And throughout a period of time, his family is basically slaughtered by the Italian mob

27
00:01:55,331 --> 00:01:57,272
and he goes on this sort of quest for revenge.

28
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:02,495
It's important to note that even though this is an established franchise for 2K, Mafia

29
00:02:02,675 --> 00:02:04,976
1 and 2 were built by our studio in the Czech Republic.

30
00:02:05,576 --> 00:02:08,678
This is the first project that Hangar 13 dev team took on.

31
00:02:08,978 --> 00:02:12,900
So we were building a brand new team, a brand new engine, and an open world game all at

32
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,400
the same time.

33
00:02:15,921 --> 00:02:20,282
If you're not familiar with the game, I'm going to show you a quick clip that encapsulates

34
00:02:20,302 --> 00:02:21,663
a little bit of the story of what's going on.

35
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,730
Everybody alright?

36
00:02:53,411 --> 00:02:57,094
That was the craziest fucking thing I've ever saw!

37
00:02:57,194 --> 00:03:00,516
Why don't you give us something off the top?

38
00:03:00,536 --> 00:03:03,298
We need to celebrate!

39
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:04,179
I gotta tell you guys...

40
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,280
Scoot me up, man. Scoot me up.

41
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,922
You know something, Lincoln?

42
00:03:08,962 --> 00:03:18,349
You're possibly the baddest motherfucker I ever laid my eyes on.

43
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:20,831
You shouldn't have said no.

44
00:03:22,221 --> 00:03:24,982
Where the fuck do you think you're going?

45
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:39,169
Where the fuck did you go you goddamned moron?

46
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:40,630
Motherfucker!

47
00:04:06,602 --> 00:04:09,284
I forgot to mention it's a violent game, there's a little bit of language in there.

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,361
So, what to expect over the next hour.

49
00:04:12,822 --> 00:04:17,426
I'm going to walk you through how we attempted to deliver period authentic vehicle audio

50
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:18,687
in a large open world environment.

51
00:04:19,308 --> 00:04:20,689
Some of the things we learned along the way.

52
00:04:20,869 --> 00:04:24,773
I'm going to do a pretty deep dive into the recording techniques we did for cars, trucks,

53
00:04:24,813 --> 00:04:28,457
boats and tires and touch on some of the implementation methods that we chose.

54
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,019
Simple stats about the game.

55
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,541
I'll just run through this really quick.

56
00:04:33,713 --> 00:04:38,375
There were 90-plus vehicles, 40-plus weapons, about 10 districts, 10 full suburbs we had

57
00:04:38,415 --> 00:04:40,915
to build, a little over four hours of cinematic material.

58
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:46,397
We had a licensed soundtrack of about 106 songs, original composed score, three full

59
00:04:46,437 --> 00:04:50,698
radio stations, complete with commercials, news, all that kind of stuff.

60
00:04:51,719 --> 00:04:54,163
We were about half a million lines of dialogue once localized.

61
00:04:55,064 --> 00:04:57,547
We used WI's inside of our own proprietary engine.

62
00:04:58,309 --> 00:05:03,756
We mixed in 7.1 and our audio budget kind of peaked out at around 75% of one core and

63
00:05:03,796 --> 00:05:04,918
around 206 meg.

64
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:08,103
On average we were a little bit less than that, but that's kind of where we peaked.

65
00:05:10,163 --> 00:05:13,648
So really early in development, what we knew was that the time period was going to be 1968

66
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:18,313
and I needed to find cars from 68 and about 30 years earlier than that.

67
00:05:18,914 --> 00:05:23,600
And I knew I needed classic American and European cars, I needed trucks, boats and we had to

68
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,303
service about 90 fictional vehicles in the game.

69
00:05:27,905 --> 00:05:28,987
Our goals were...

70
00:05:29,893 --> 00:05:30,874
to deliver authenticity.

71
00:05:31,694 --> 00:05:34,316
Actually these first two goals really came from kind of studio pillars.

72
00:05:34,536 --> 00:05:39,018
One was to always remind the player that they were in New Orleans in 1968.

73
00:05:40,018 --> 00:05:43,000
So we wanted to always convey a sense of time and place and authenticity.

74
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,582
But then at the same time we had this other goal which was to deliver this Hollywood action

75
00:05:47,622 --> 00:05:50,323
driving which basically meant excitement versus simulation.

76
00:05:50,743 --> 00:05:54,485
So immediately there's a contradiction between being authentic and being over the top and

77
00:05:54,505 --> 00:05:55,806
we had to kind of draw a line there.

78
00:05:56,706 --> 00:06:00,490
We always wanted to immerse the player into the car and we did that through radio stations,

79
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:04,573
the vehicle interacting with the environment, all sorts of environmental changes when you're

80
00:06:04,593 --> 00:06:07,656
in the vehicle and we knew we wanted to provide a big variety.

81
00:06:09,297 --> 00:06:12,380
All the cars in our game were fictional makes and models so we had a little bit of freedom

82
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:12,580
there.

83
00:06:14,281 --> 00:06:15,763
Our recording goals were really simple.

84
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:19,686
You know, safety first, don't be stupid, try not to break shit.

85
00:06:20,457 --> 00:06:23,860
Capture great sound and then if we had time, take some photos and video while we were there.

86
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:27,143
And I'll show you a few of those recording sessions throughout the next hour.

87
00:06:29,228 --> 00:06:30,208
So how do we find these cars?

88
00:06:30,948 --> 00:06:34,650
We started by trying to plug into the local community, so we started going to classic

89
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:39,992
car shows and we ended up partnering with a car club who wasn't really tied to one

90
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:40,732
particular brand.

91
00:06:40,772 --> 00:06:44,593
It wasn't like the Corvette Club or the Mustang Club, it was just this local club of about

92
00:06:45,654 --> 00:06:45,954
650 members.

93
00:06:46,554 --> 00:06:50,695
And they had everything from old cars to new cars, fast cars, slow cars, and they ended

94
00:06:50,735 --> 00:06:53,516
up being kind of an agent that would help us find all the different cars we wanted.

95
00:06:54,421 --> 00:06:58,444
We had friends make suggestions, we ended up working with a truck service centre just

96
00:06:58,504 --> 00:07:03,027
north of here in Greenbrae, a marine service centre in Sausalito and we also went to a

97
00:07:03,067 --> 00:07:05,689
supercharger factory down in Southern California.

98
00:07:08,314 --> 00:07:10,016
So some of the challenges of scale.

99
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:13,600
We knew it was going to be time and cost prohibitive to record 90 unique vehicles.

100
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:18,064
So we decided to just find the most diverse group of engines that we possibly could.

101
00:07:18,364 --> 00:07:21,527
We needed a mixture of some regular cars and some high performance cars.

102
00:07:22,168 --> 00:07:25,051
And we had to figure out how and where we were going to do this.

103
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,213
And you know, I had these really early...

104
00:07:28,554 --> 00:07:33,597
goals of, you know, I love racing games and I wanted to be as detailed and as amazing

105
00:07:33,637 --> 00:07:35,719
as some of these really great racing games that I love to play.

106
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:40,061
And really quickly reality set in that, you know, this is just one slice of a much bigger

107
00:07:40,081 --> 00:07:40,361
pie.

108
00:07:40,442 --> 00:07:43,123
You know, it's an open world game, it's not purely a racing game.

109
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:48,687
And you know, we had to think about our allocation of resources, not just memory and CPU, but

110
00:07:48,947 --> 00:07:51,488
how much time we could devote to this, and of course the cost.

111
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:53,169
So you know, even though...

112
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,552
It was a smaller part of a much bigger game.

113
00:07:56,752 --> 00:08:00,797
Our goal was always to try and reach to be as good as possible or as close to these really

114
00:08:00,837 --> 00:08:02,759
amazing racing games that I love to play.

115
00:08:04,741 --> 00:08:09,886
Our final count ended in 30 recording sessions, which was 20 cars, two trucks, seven boats,

116
00:08:10,707 --> 00:08:14,111
one electric car, and now we're actively recording new cars for our DLC packs.

117
00:08:16,566 --> 00:08:20,028
When it comes to recording a car or any type of engine, there's a whole number of different

118
00:08:20,048 --> 00:08:20,628
ways you can go.

119
00:08:20,648 --> 00:08:24,451
And I'm not going to claim that our method was better or worse than anyone else's.

120
00:08:24,491 --> 00:08:26,993
I'm just going to walk you through some of those different methods you can choose from.

121
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:30,075
You can go out on an open track or an open road.

122
00:08:30,736 --> 00:08:34,498
You can use a roller dynamometer or you can use a hydraulic dynamometer, which I'll go

123
00:08:34,518 --> 00:08:35,419
into a little more detail.

124
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,462
And each one of those has unique challenges and advantages and disadvantages.

125
00:08:40,082 --> 00:08:41,463
And there's probably other methods out there.

126
00:08:41,503 --> 00:08:43,365
These are just the four that I was really familiar with.

127
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:48,217
What we chose to do was use a dynapack for our cars.

128
00:08:49,058 --> 00:08:53,122
We took our tyres to a racetrack, we did our trucks out on the open road, and then boats

129
00:08:53,202 --> 00:08:55,564
we recorded both in water and on dry land.

130
00:08:56,045 --> 00:08:57,806
And I'll go into more detail on that in a moment.

131
00:09:00,247 --> 00:09:02,128
If you're not familiar, what's a dyno?

132
00:09:02,148 --> 00:09:06,330
A dyno is basically a treadmill that lets you put your car on it and drive the car at

133
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,951
any speed you want while it's not moving.

134
00:09:08,371 --> 00:09:13,154
It's something that allows a mechanic to tune the car, measure the performance of the car

135
00:09:13,194 --> 00:09:17,736
and basically change the performance of a car at all different speeds while it's stationary.

136
00:09:19,897 --> 00:09:20,858
So why choose a dyno?

137
00:09:20,998 --> 00:09:26,561
It would be so much more fun to get out on a racetrack and thrash around in these cars.

138
00:09:26,681 --> 00:09:27,481
Why do this method?

139
00:09:28,804 --> 00:09:30,806
For us, it was a few things.

140
00:09:30,866 --> 00:09:32,047
It was really a matter of safety.

141
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:35,330
We're dealing with old cars that are 45 to 75 years old.

142
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,251
I don't know how reliable they are.

143
00:09:37,371 --> 00:09:38,412
I don't know if the brakes work.

144
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:39,513
I don't know if the steering works.

145
00:09:39,773 --> 00:09:43,436
I don't really want to put my team members in these cars and send them off at high speed

146
00:09:43,476 --> 00:09:44,117
down a racetrack.

147
00:09:46,205 --> 00:09:48,545
But it also provides a really controlled recording environment.

148
00:09:49,566 --> 00:09:53,747
We minimize the risk of damage to these cars and we have this hands-off miking approach.

149
00:09:54,787 --> 00:09:57,727
When I started speaking to some of the vehicle owners, they got really concerned.

150
00:09:57,747 --> 00:10:01,868
They imagined us driving around a racetrack with all sorts of stuff clamped and taped

151
00:10:01,888 --> 00:10:02,809
to the side of their cars.

152
00:10:02,989 --> 00:10:07,630
And these are old show cars with beautiful paint jobs and they take them to displays

153
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,970
but they don't really want to push them that hard.

154
00:10:09,691 --> 00:10:14,659
So when we started suggesting this as a method to record, we earned their trust much more

155
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:18,144
easily and they were willing to work with us because it was a much more hands-off approach,

156
00:10:18,204 --> 00:10:19,386
much more controlled environment.

157
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:24,956
The downside of recording with a dyno is that it can be kind of too clinical.

158
00:10:25,116 --> 00:10:27,337
Sometimes you lose some of that great character of an engine.

159
00:10:28,137 --> 00:10:29,738
And you also have a lot of overheating risks.

160
00:10:30,238 --> 00:10:33,599
When you're in a controlled room like that, you have to put really large fans in the front

161
00:10:33,619 --> 00:10:37,661
of the engine to bring airflow in and exhaust fans at the back to pull the exhaust out.

162
00:10:38,361 --> 00:10:41,743
And we don't want that for recording, so we would record with the fans off, which meant

163
00:10:41,783 --> 00:10:43,883
we had to be really, really careful to not overheat the cars.

164
00:10:46,244 --> 00:10:49,365
Here's a picture of the dyno we used with a 1940s Plymouth.

165
00:10:52,732 --> 00:10:55,293
So there's two different types of dynos that at least I'm aware of.

166
00:10:55,913 --> 00:11:00,395
There's a traditional roller dyno which is really quick, it's really easy, you just drive

167
00:11:00,415 --> 00:11:04,056
the car straight on, it works with almost any type of car and it's really common, easy

168
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:04,436
to find.

169
00:11:05,137 --> 00:11:08,878
The downside is that the rollers themselves produce so much noise that it kind of makes

170
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,039
it impractical for recording.

171
00:11:10,939 --> 00:11:14,480
There's also a slight safety risk in that there's a lot of inertia involved in the car

172
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,081
and it can break and launch forward into the wall.

173
00:11:18,462 --> 00:11:21,683
But really the biggest downside for us is the noise, it just ruins the recording.

174
00:11:23,084 --> 00:11:28,008
So if you use a DynaPak, which is a brand developed in New Zealand, it's basically a hydraulic

175
00:11:28,048 --> 00:11:28,308
brake.

176
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:32,772
You take the wheels off the car, you bolt this machine directly onto the wheels, and

177
00:11:32,812 --> 00:11:36,715
it's a computer-controlled brake that dials up the resistance and the load on the engine.

178
00:11:37,736 --> 00:11:39,678
The big bonus is that it's practically silent.

179
00:11:39,758 --> 00:11:40,659
It makes no noise at all.

180
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,682
It's really accurate, because we're working with old cars where the gauges probably aren't

181
00:11:44,722 --> 00:11:45,403
really that accurate.

182
00:11:46,243 --> 00:11:46,924
And it's really safe.

183
00:11:46,984 --> 00:11:47,724
There's no inertia.

184
00:11:47,765 --> 00:11:50,126
There's no chance the car can brake and launch forward.

185
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:56,103
The downside to it is that they're really rare, they're hard to find, and you usually

186
00:11:56,143 --> 00:11:58,726
have to work with a high performance workshop that's really expensive.

187
00:11:59,627 --> 00:12:03,651
It takes a lot longer to put the car on and off the dyno, you have to basically jack it

188
00:12:03,691 --> 00:12:06,013
up and take the wheels off, so there's more time invested.

189
00:12:07,398 --> 00:12:10,840
And one of the other downsides is that there's certain cars it just won't work with.

190
00:12:11,001 --> 00:12:15,404
You know, if you have side exhaust pipes or really wide fenders or non-standard wheel

191
00:12:15,424 --> 00:12:18,126
types, chances are you can't put the car on the dyno.

192
00:12:18,646 --> 00:12:22,950
And the little side story about this car on the lower left here, this is a...

193
00:12:24,856 --> 00:12:29,237
Late 1960s McLaren race car, when all said and done, it's about $800,000.

194
00:12:29,377 --> 00:12:34,479
The thing had just been rebuilt from head to toe and the owner agreed to let us record

195
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:34,579
it.

196
00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:38,440
But we had a 48-hour window that we had to record it before he was going to ship it off

197
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:38,920
to a race.

198
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,061
So we found a machine shop that basically built us custom adapters within two days so

199
00:12:44,081 --> 00:12:46,122
that we could stick this machine on the dyno and capture it.

200
00:12:46,402 --> 00:12:47,282
It was an 8 liter, 800 horsepower.

201
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,482
V8, it's the loudest car I've ever heard.

202
00:12:52,502 --> 00:12:56,084
If you can imagine a lion right here kind of roaring at you, that's what this thing

203
00:12:56,104 --> 00:12:56,585
sounded like.

204
00:12:57,865 --> 00:13:00,947
So there's a picture of that car on the dyno with the body removed, and you can kind of

205
00:13:00,987 --> 00:13:02,909
see where we had custom adapters to fit it in.

206
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:07,972
That was one of those cars where your ears ring for three days even with hearing protection.

207
00:13:09,953 --> 00:13:10,733
So typical schedule.

208
00:13:12,606 --> 00:13:15,448
Through a little trial and error we worked out we could record about three cars in one

209
00:13:15,468 --> 00:13:15,648
day.

210
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:21,392
It was a pretty long day, but it basically took us an hour to set up, 30 minutes to pack

211
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:21,532
up.

212
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:26,956
It's really important to note that before we turn the key on any car, myself, the vehicle

213
00:13:26,996 --> 00:13:30,998
owner and the dyno technician would have a quick conversation and we'd talk about the

214
00:13:31,038 --> 00:13:34,861
limitations of the car, the RPM ranges that they're comfortable with, the temperature

215
00:13:34,921 --> 00:13:38,363
ranges that they're comfortable with, and basically just let them know that we were

216
00:13:38,383 --> 00:13:41,365
going to respect their property and we weren't going to be irresponsible with it.

217
00:13:41,795 --> 00:13:44,638
And then the owner was really comfortable in letting us do what we wanted to do.

218
00:13:45,598 --> 00:13:49,401
It took up to an hour to mount the car and up to half an hour to dismount the car.

219
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,323
The recording itself was quite easy.

220
00:13:51,343 --> 00:13:53,524
It took us less than an hour per car.

221
00:13:54,345 --> 00:13:56,406
And then we'd do a foley session with each car afterwards.

222
00:13:59,347 --> 00:14:03,312
So some of the limitations we ran into was that we're dealing with old cars that have

223
00:14:03,412 --> 00:14:04,893
various levels of reliability.

224
00:14:05,494 --> 00:14:07,977
Their cooling systems are nowhere near as efficient as modern cars.

225
00:14:08,978 --> 00:14:10,560
Some of them just can't do what you want them to do.

226
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,543
We had one car that couldn't rev more than about 2,500 RPM.

227
00:14:16,441 --> 00:14:21,124
This car that's in the picture here, this is a 1930s American Bantam.

228
00:14:21,364 --> 00:14:26,887
For anyone who's familiar with engines, it's a 2.8 litre V8 with a flat head, supercharger

229
00:14:26,927 --> 00:14:27,528
and dual webbers.

230
00:14:28,328 --> 00:14:30,850
And it's a really inefficient cooling type car.

231
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:34,152
So this car, we could record for 12 seconds and then it would overheat and we'd have to

232
00:14:34,192 --> 00:14:34,912
stop for 10 minutes.

233
00:14:34,992 --> 00:14:37,394
And then we could record for 12 seconds and then stop for 10 minutes.

234
00:14:38,034 --> 00:14:39,455
But it sounded so amazing it was worth it.

235
00:14:40,616 --> 00:14:44,638
At the other end of the spectrum we had a European car whose name I'm not allowed to

236
00:14:44,658 --> 00:14:44,798
mention.

237
00:14:45,573 --> 00:14:48,455
mention, but they're Italian and they like red.

238
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:53,198
And the owner of that car basically said, you know, you

239
00:14:53,218 --> 00:14:54,819
can do whatever this thing lets you do.

240
00:14:54,939 --> 00:14:56,780
Push it to 8,500 RPM if you want.

241
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:57,780
And we did.

242
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,821
And it sounded fantastic.

243
00:15:00,063 --> 00:15:02,565
One of the things we learned, that regular cars just sound kind of boring.

244
00:15:03,565 --> 00:15:07,309
We had this idea of not everyone in the city owns a hot rod, so we have to have this mixture

245
00:15:07,349 --> 00:15:08,950
of regular and high performance cars.

246
00:15:09,631 --> 00:15:12,193
And the regular cars just sounded more boring than we thought they would.

247
00:15:12,673 --> 00:15:16,917
So I think for future, we will always go with slightly modified and heavily modified cars.

248
00:15:18,138 --> 00:15:20,960
And then the really obvious one was that anything with a rear engine was going to be really

249
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,282
difficult to get a separation of engine and exhaust.

250
00:15:25,187 --> 00:15:28,370
So specifically some of the things that went wrong, we had some cars with starter motor

251
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:33,773
issues, one car had a carburettor issue, two overheated, we had some cars that didn't show

252
00:15:33,853 --> 00:15:38,556
up on brief, they had different wheels and different exhaust pipes, we even had some

253
00:15:38,616 --> 00:15:42,159
car owners who they had these really beautiful show cars and they wouldn't drive them if

254
00:15:42,219 --> 00:15:43,940
it was a wet road the day after raining.

255
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,423
So the key there is really to have backups planned before your recording session.

256
00:15:50,304 --> 00:15:53,226
So now we know what we're going to record, where we're going to record and how we're

257
00:15:53,246 --> 00:15:53,727
going to record.

258
00:15:54,383 --> 00:15:57,685
But now we get down to the meat and potatoes of what we're actually going to capture.

259
00:15:58,565 --> 00:16:02,767
We decided to do engine start, stop, false start, idle, rev blips.

260
00:16:03,287 --> 00:16:07,889
We do ramp runs, which is basically getting the car from idle all the way to maximum RPM,

261
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:09,470
and we would do that fast and slow.

262
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:12,671
And that was mainly as a reference, so we could hear what the car should sound like

263
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,172
as it's accelerating and decelerating.

264
00:16:16,452 --> 00:16:20,554
We decided to record loops of about six seconds, which we didn't need that much, but it was

265
00:16:20,594 --> 00:16:21,594
just enough for us to work with.

266
00:16:22,462 --> 00:16:24,363
And we would put a really high load on the engine,

267
00:16:24,423 --> 00:16:27,284
and we'd do a really fine level of loops,

268
00:16:27,424 --> 00:16:29,724
you know, 200 RPM increments all the way up to 2,000,

269
00:16:30,024 --> 00:16:32,745
and then 500 RPM increments up to redline.

270
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:35,746
And then we'd repeat that whole process under a low load.

271
00:16:36,866 --> 00:16:38,266
Our goal was to get three perspectives.

272
00:16:38,466 --> 00:16:40,727
We wanted the engine, the exhaust, and the interior.

273
00:16:41,587 --> 00:16:43,348
And then afterwards, when one car was finished,

274
00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:45,548
we'd take it to another location and do a Foley session

275
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,049
of everything that opened and closed

276
00:16:47,109 --> 00:16:47,989
and clinked and clunked

277
00:16:48,969 --> 00:16:50,230
while we started preparing the next car.

278
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:55,996
The gear we used, I won't run through this in high detail, but basically it was an 8

279
00:16:56,136 --> 00:16:57,376
channel sound devices unit.

280
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:03,138
If I could only choose one microphone for vehicle recordings it would be the DPA 4060s.

281
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:08,880
They were reliable in every single situation and really versatile and if I could choose

282
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,800
one mic that would be it.

283
00:17:13,481 --> 00:17:17,164
I guess the other one to note is the AKG D112s, which are really designed for kick drums,

284
00:17:17,585 --> 00:17:20,947
but we used them on exhausts to get that really low rumble of the exhaust.

285
00:17:21,648 --> 00:17:24,230
And then over time as we did these sessions, you know, we expanded our kit.

286
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:27,233
We were recording directly into Pro Tools through an interface at one point.

287
00:17:27,933 --> 00:17:31,496
We added a Zoom F8 so that we could slave the two together and get 16 channels.

288
00:17:31,937 --> 00:17:33,598
So over time we kind of expanded our kit.

289
00:17:35,853 --> 00:17:38,775
Just really simple extra common sense stuff to bring to a recording session.

290
00:17:39,095 --> 00:17:43,697
Bring cameras, bring first aid kits, spare cables and batteries of every kind.

291
00:17:44,258 --> 00:17:46,399
And probably the most important thing to note there is sandbags.

292
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:52,783
The last thing I want to do is hang a boom over a $150,000 Porsche and have the mic stand

293
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:53,804
fall over and dent the car.

294
00:17:54,224 --> 00:17:57,386
So it's really important to get some really cheap sandbags and weight everything down.

295
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:02,234
Some really common sense tips when you're recording cars.

296
00:18:02,534 --> 00:18:04,095
Confirm everything the day before.

297
00:18:04,395 --> 00:18:06,996
It's not as important to them to show up to your session as it is to you.

298
00:18:08,197 --> 00:18:10,398
Plan plenty of backup cars in case if you can.

299
00:18:11,018 --> 00:18:11,579
Be flexible.

300
00:18:11,619 --> 00:18:12,980
Some of these cars don't do what you want.

301
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,681
So it's really important to adjust your priorities.

302
00:18:15,801 --> 00:18:19,243
And if a car is overheating, you may have to kind of decide what are the most important

303
00:18:19,283 --> 00:18:23,085
things that I need to record now and kind of change your plan around a little bit.

304
00:18:24,628 --> 00:18:26,409
And then just use whatever method is the easiest.

305
00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:30,230
It's really impractical to be typing into an iPad when you're moving on a boat at 90

306
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,011
miles an hour.

307
00:18:31,131 --> 00:18:36,273
So use pen and paper, use laminated sheets, use whatever is really simple and just easy.

308
00:18:37,253 --> 00:18:41,695
And then the biggest takeaway here is investigate what your legal issues and permits and insurance

309
00:18:41,735 --> 00:18:43,236
needs are really far in advance.

310
00:18:44,677 --> 00:18:48,418
For our Tire session, which I'll show you in a moment, we started working with our legal

311
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,519
team maybe three months before the recording session.

312
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:53,100
And their rules were really simple.

313
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,460
Don't break the law, be safe and responsible.

314
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,061
And everything from that they were willing to support us with.

315
00:18:58,321 --> 00:19:01,262
But sometimes that can take a really long time to prepare.

316
00:19:01,482 --> 00:19:04,443
We had to prepare nearly three months in advance for that recording session.

317
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,503
So, where to place the mic?

318
00:19:08,723 --> 00:19:11,444
Well, this is as open a question as any.

319
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:12,865
It's all down to choice.

320
00:19:13,525 --> 00:19:17,827
For an eight mic setup, we chose to put three in the engine bay, four on the exhaust for

321
00:19:17,867 --> 00:19:19,888
a dual exhaust system, and one on the interior.

322
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:23,650
Over time, we expanded to a 16 mic setup.

323
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,491
And that wasn't really because we needed more coverage of the car.

324
00:19:26,612 --> 00:19:29,253
It was just because we were getting different tonalities from different mics.

325
00:19:29,513 --> 00:19:32,914
And on some of those really expensive rare cars, we just wanted to have backup channels

326
00:19:32,974 --> 00:19:33,195
as well.

327
00:19:34,988 --> 00:19:39,390
But specifically we would put the DPA labs inside the engine bay and usually we would

328
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:43,431
put one close to the intake to get that kind of sucking air sound and then we'd look for

329
00:19:43,491 --> 00:19:45,632
something else that was unique and different inside the engine.

330
00:19:45,912 --> 00:19:49,894
And sometimes that was down at the back firewall, sometimes it was underneath the engine near

331
00:19:49,914 --> 00:19:51,114
the exhaust manifold.

332
00:19:52,535 --> 00:19:55,436
It was basically just looking for something that was different and unique about that engine.

333
00:19:56,536 --> 00:19:59,457
And then we would have one mic a few feet back from the engine to just get an overall

334
00:19:59,477 --> 00:19:59,738
picture.

335
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:05,350
And we would put two shotguns at the back of the exhaust and then the two AKG D112s

336
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,731
to get the low rumble of the exhaust.

337
00:20:07,371 --> 00:20:10,533
And then usually just one mic on the interior down where the passenger's feet would go.

338
00:20:13,575 --> 00:20:15,956
And I'll show you a video of the cars towards the end.

339
00:20:17,137 --> 00:20:19,158
When it comes to trucks, it's an entirely different beast.

340
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:22,661
The challenges we had was being able to record them in isolation.

341
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,382
We couldn't find a dyno for trucks.

342
00:20:25,483 --> 00:20:27,264
So we ended up recording them out on the open road.

343
00:20:28,035 --> 00:20:30,515
We did one day per truck just by myself.

344
00:20:31,576 --> 00:20:35,037
And the most important thing is a highly skilled driver is more important than the truck itself.

345
00:20:36,497 --> 00:20:37,518
And I'll get into that in a moment.

346
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,699
Trucks are really hot engines.

347
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:45,140
And I was really worried about these really thin mic cables just melting in five minutes.

348
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,321
So what I ended up doing was going to a hardware store and buying dishwasher hose.

349
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,241
It was really cheap.

350
00:20:50,761 --> 00:20:54,663
It was a way to run all the mic cables through and insulate them and we were able to do these

351
00:20:54,683 --> 00:20:55,923
sessions without damaging anything.

352
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:02,252
The truck itself is a big clunky machine, so you try and use the body of the truck to

353
00:21:02,292 --> 00:21:04,613
build natural windbreaks, and I'll show you a picture of that.

354
00:21:05,953 --> 00:21:09,955
Here you can see kind of towards the back of the truck, we used the frame to position

355
00:21:09,995 --> 00:21:13,696
our mics and we wrapped them in foam and tried to use the cabin of the truck to protect us

356
00:21:13,716 --> 00:21:14,157
from the wind.

357
00:21:15,757 --> 00:21:17,758
The real challenge was recording steady states.

358
00:21:19,357 --> 00:21:23,200
So, what we did, we had this really skilled driver who went all up through the hills of

359
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,583
Marin Headlands and he knew exactly which road to be on to be the right gradient of

360
00:21:27,623 --> 00:21:30,945
hill with the right amount of load on the engine and the right gear so that he could

361
00:21:31,005 --> 00:21:34,767
hold the truck really steady under load and let us get a usable loop.

362
00:21:35,688 --> 00:21:38,630
And then we did the whole process again by adding weight to the truck and he added the

363
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:38,930
trailer.

364
00:21:40,401 --> 00:21:44,084
With a truck, the one characteristic that I really wanted to capture is called the jake

365
00:21:44,104 --> 00:21:44,324
brake.

366
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:46,866
It's an exhaust system.

367
00:21:46,886 --> 00:21:50,008
I don't know if you hear trucks go downhill and they kind of make that ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

368
00:21:50,168 --> 00:21:51,629
sound that some people don't like.

369
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:57,574
That's a valve that uses the truck's pressure to help slow it down.

370
00:21:57,634 --> 00:22:00,136
And that was something we really wanted to capture and use in the game.

371
00:22:02,058 --> 00:22:05,941
I'd like to play you just a really quick sample of how our final results of our trucks ended

372
00:22:05,981 --> 00:22:06,461
up in the game.

373
00:22:06,521 --> 00:22:08,583
This runs for about a minute, a minute and a half.

374
00:22:22,516 --> 00:22:23,839
Thanks for watching.

375
00:23:28,555 --> 00:23:31,257
So, when it came to boats, again, that was an entirely different process.

376
00:23:35,169 --> 00:23:38,332
We did a three day recording session to capture seven different boat engines.

377
00:23:38,812 --> 00:23:42,575
And again, early on in the process, we didn't know exactly what the final art models would

378
00:23:42,615 --> 00:23:47,879
be, but we knew we had to provide small fishing boats, medium boats, some sort of high speed

379
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:53,724
drug smuggling boat, some sort of large police patrol or coast guard boat, and then the kind

380
00:23:53,764 --> 00:23:55,425
of bayou swamp fan boat.

381
00:23:58,507 --> 00:24:02,450
What we found was that the really small, less than 10 horsepower engines, it's really easy

382
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:03,311
to record them in a tank.

383
00:24:04,647 --> 00:24:08,692
We found that being out on the water wasn't so difficult for us to maintain steady RPM

384
00:24:08,732 --> 00:24:09,052
states.

385
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:13,998
If you can go out on a smooth, calm, nice weather day, that really helps compared to

386
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:14,559
choppy weather.

387
00:24:15,712 --> 00:24:20,114
And one thing we learned was that the exhaust of most boats is submerged under the water,

388
00:24:20,154 --> 00:24:24,276
so it really offers you nothing to record other than that slight kind of glug, glug,

389
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,436
glug sound when you're at idle.

390
00:24:26,236 --> 00:24:29,718
So what we decided to do was record a second pass of each boat on dry land.

391
00:24:30,238 --> 00:24:33,739
And what you can do is connect, you know, the boats need water for cooling, but you

392
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:37,641
can connect the hose to the engine and then you can record a second pass to get that exhaust

393
00:24:37,681 --> 00:24:40,222
and get that really aggressive bite that we wanted from the boats.

394
00:24:40,482 --> 00:24:41,942
And then we blended those recordings together.

395
00:24:45,811 --> 00:24:49,853
What we decided to do was take the engine covers off, put the DPAs under the engine.

396
00:24:50,713 --> 00:24:55,555
We knew that the blimps and shotgun mics were going to, at some level, they were going to

397
00:24:55,595 --> 00:24:58,417
work for low speeds and then at higher speeds they were going to become useless.

398
00:24:59,057 --> 00:25:03,039
So having those DPA mics under the engine covers, we had a natural windbreak and it

399
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:07,341
didn't matter what speed, what RPM we were at, we knew we would get some clean, reliable

400
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:08,181
recordings from them.

401
00:25:12,643 --> 00:25:14,104
I had this growing concern that...

402
00:25:15,312 --> 00:25:17,472
You know, salt water and microphones don't mix.

403
00:25:18,053 --> 00:25:21,374
And we could have very easily just destroyed all our gear in one day.

404
00:25:21,614 --> 00:25:23,394
And we knew everything was going to get really wet.

405
00:25:23,975 --> 00:25:27,716
So I decided to go to one of those fabric stores where they sell sewing material.

406
00:25:27,756 --> 00:25:30,857
And I said, do you guys sell anything, any kind of waterproof fabric that I could buy?

407
00:25:30,877 --> 00:25:32,878
And they said, yeah, sure.

408
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:34,218
This is our baby diaper section.

409
00:25:34,618 --> 00:25:37,119
You can have camouflage or you can have this.

410
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,720
And I thought about it for a while.

411
00:25:40,529 --> 00:25:44,793
We went with the camouflage, but we basically bought this fabric, wrapped up the mics, sprayed

412
00:25:44,813 --> 00:25:49,337
them with that Scotchgard stuff that's great for your shoes, and made sure we kind of pointed

413
00:25:49,357 --> 00:25:50,578
the back of the mic into the wind.

414
00:25:50,698 --> 00:25:54,421
And you know, these things got soaked every single day, but we were able to protect, you

415
00:25:54,641 --> 00:25:58,824
know, for maybe $30 worth of extra materials, we were able to protect all our gear and not

416
00:25:58,844 --> 00:25:59,385
break anything.

417
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:01,146
So, that was really worthwhile.

418
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:05,630
And then we used a contact mic on the hull of the boat to get all the thumps and bumps.

419
00:26:07,329 --> 00:26:11,312
What I would like to show you is a quick video of the recording session and one more quick

420
00:26:11,352 --> 00:26:13,074
video of how those boats ended up in game.

421
00:26:39,244 --> 00:26:40,385
Thanks for watching!

422
00:28:17,923 --> 00:28:18,904
That was a really, really fun day.

423
00:28:18,925 --> 00:28:22,829
Here's a little quick sample of how some of those sounds got used in game.

424
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:27,874
What you'll hear is more of the water spray, more of the thumps and bumps and some of the

425
00:28:27,894 --> 00:28:28,695
different things we did.

426
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:32,479
On the fan boat, you'll hear that we added vibrations for rudder control and all that

427
00:28:32,499 --> 00:28:32,939
kind of stuff.

428
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,663
So here's an example of how our final boat audio ended up in game.

429
00:29:31,698 --> 00:29:32,198
Don't forget to subscribe!

430
00:30:23,096 --> 00:30:27,859
Some of the additional pieces that we added to the engine, our designers wanted to add

431
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:33,083
forced induction, superchargers and turbochargers, and the difficult part about recording a supercharger

432
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:35,965
is that the engine that is underneath it, of course, is going to be loud.

433
00:30:36,705 --> 00:30:42,209
So we contacted a factory that makes superchargers down in Southern California, and by total

434
00:30:42,249 --> 00:30:46,652
luck, they have a completely soundproof room in their factory where they spool these up

435
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:50,315
on electric motors and test them and make sure that they're working properly before

436
00:30:50,355 --> 00:30:51,976
they package them off to their customers.

437
00:30:52,821 --> 00:30:55,023
I couldn't have been more lucky with the conditions.

438
00:30:55,203 --> 00:30:57,565
And they agreed to let us in there, so we recorded that way.

439
00:30:58,406 --> 00:30:59,687
The turbo was a little more difficult.

440
00:30:59,727 --> 00:31:03,770
We couldn't find a similar situation, so it became a combination of real turbos,

441
00:31:04,911 --> 00:31:06,693
sound design and foley.

442
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:10,917
We used ball-bearing keychains, compressed air, hospital defibrillators

443
00:31:10,977 --> 00:31:12,858
and all sorts of different things to make our turbo sounds.

444
00:31:14,729 --> 00:31:19,810
With the police sirens, we also had a real hard time finding a car with a 1960s siren.

445
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:24,871
It was early 60s where they started experimenting with electronic sirens and went away from

446
00:31:24,911 --> 00:31:27,051
the old rotating impeller type sirens.

447
00:31:27,812 --> 00:31:31,952
So we ended up going to eBay and just buying a siren and that's how we managed to capture

448
00:31:31,992 --> 00:31:32,133
that.

449
00:31:32,573 --> 00:31:37,274
We also found that a lot of the sounds from a 1960s police siren is due to the police

450
00:31:37,314 --> 00:31:41,835
officers messing with the buttons and kind of moving the siren halfway between two different

451
00:31:41,855 --> 00:31:43,775
positions and kind of messing with it that way.

452
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:44,155
So that's...

453
00:31:45,216 --> 00:31:47,076
That was something we really wanted to capture and recreate.

454
00:31:49,537 --> 00:31:53,038
Brings me to tires. This was also one of the most fun parts of the whole project for us.

455
00:31:54,878 --> 00:31:58,699
Our goals were to capture a clean set of tire sounds in isolation from an engine.

456
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:02,320
We wanted to capture multiple different surfaces, including a wet road,

457
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,101
and then share that same recording across all vehicles in the game.

458
00:32:07,181 --> 00:32:10,802
The challenge really was preparation.

459
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,991
You know, we looked at a whole bunch of different options of how to do this.

460
00:32:15,171 --> 00:32:19,853
We knew that by using an electric car that would provide us a quiet engine and there

461
00:32:19,873 --> 00:32:23,075
was only really one model of electric car that had enough horsepower to do what we wanted.

462
00:32:25,613 --> 00:32:29,935
We looked at private racetracks, runways, commercial racetracks, and for all different

463
00:32:29,975 --> 00:32:32,176
reasons it wasn't really a great option for us.

464
00:32:32,476 --> 00:32:33,956
Some people declined to record with us.

465
00:32:34,976 --> 00:32:38,658
There was a commercial racetrack really close to our office, but they have a go-kart track

466
00:32:38,698 --> 00:32:43,559
and a drag racing strip, and we really couldn't get a private, quiet place to record.

467
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:48,301
We could, but it would have been really expensive to rent out the entire facility.

468
00:32:49,681 --> 00:32:52,802
So what we settled on was Laguna Seca Mazda Raceway down in Monterrey.

469
00:32:53,162 --> 00:32:54,783
That's about two hours south of here.

470
00:32:55,966 --> 00:32:59,189
The reason for Laguna Seca was it was really reasonably priced.

471
00:33:00,069 --> 00:33:04,073
If I want the racetrack, it's about $15,000 a day, but the skid pad area is only $1,000

472
00:33:04,773 --> 00:33:05,074
per day.

473
00:33:06,715 --> 00:33:07,796
It's a really safe place.

474
00:33:08,356 --> 00:33:10,778
It's really away from any kind of main roads.

475
00:33:10,978 --> 00:33:12,399
It's not accessible to the public.

476
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,322
And the skid pad area is enclosed and locked.

477
00:33:15,542 --> 00:33:20,666
And again, speaking with our legal team, their rules were don't break the law, be safe and

478
00:33:20,686 --> 00:33:21,187
responsible.

479
00:33:21,267 --> 00:33:24,109
So that was kind of the mandate that I took when I was looking for this recording session.

480
00:33:25,727 --> 00:33:30,589
Where we really lucked out is that Laguna Seca is on county owned land and they have

481
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:34,370
a noise ordinance where they're not allowed to reach a certain average noise level.

482
00:33:35,051 --> 00:33:39,633
So the way they counter that is they actually close a couple days per month and do no racing

483
00:33:39,733 --> 00:33:41,814
and that brings their average noise level down for the month.

484
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:46,916
So to our luck they let us record on one of those no race days and we actually got the

485
00:33:46,956 --> 00:33:48,397
entire facility to ourself for $1,000.

486
00:33:48,437 --> 00:33:50,798
It was really terrific.

487
00:33:52,592 --> 00:33:56,834
We hired their lead driving instructor to be our driver.

488
00:33:57,014 --> 00:33:59,935
We had one technician to basically swap wheels on and off of the car.

489
00:34:00,656 --> 00:34:06,058
We rented this car from a private owner and we bought our own tires and wheels so that

490
00:34:06,078 --> 00:34:08,039
we weren't destroying his tires out on the track.

491
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:12,041
We had an ambulance on standby, which is really an inexpensive thing to do.

492
00:34:13,001 --> 00:34:15,662
And we had myself and one other sound designer and one producer.

493
00:34:17,335 --> 00:34:18,596
The whole session only ran one day.

494
00:34:18,616 --> 00:34:21,177
It was a really simple mic set up.

495
00:34:21,257 --> 00:34:24,438
We put four labs underneath each wheel.

496
00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:28,700
Basically right at the very base there where you can kind of see the corner just before

497
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,841
the wheels where we put our mics.

498
00:34:30,681 --> 00:34:34,503
And then we used these camera tripods called a cam tree gripper which is basically this

499
00:34:34,663 --> 00:34:40,225
really flexible industrial suction mount system to hang a couple of Sennheiser shotguns above

500
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:40,585
the wheels.

501
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:45,252
And then we would have the driver in the car, one person in the car, and then walkie-talkie

502
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:48,254
communication to just let everyone know if everything's okay.

503
00:34:50,415 --> 00:34:54,297
What we decided to record was really steady driving in a straight line.

504
00:34:54,657 --> 00:34:57,839
The kind of boring stuff was driving at five miles an hour, but we got this really nice

505
00:34:57,899 --> 00:34:58,719
grit from the tires.

506
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,460
All the way up to about 70.

507
00:35:01,836 --> 00:35:04,238
We did light braking but not actually skidding.

508
00:35:04,658 --> 00:35:06,360
We did braking where we were skidding.

509
00:35:07,321 --> 00:35:11,945
We drove around in circles and did light, medium and heavy sideways drifting.

510
00:35:11,965 --> 00:35:16,609
And then we got to do the really fun stuff which was pouring clouds of smoke off the

511
00:35:16,629 --> 00:35:17,830
car and getting the burnout sounds.

512
00:35:19,231 --> 00:35:24,054
Two things that we learnt in our research prior, we had to look at what type of tyres

513
00:35:24,074 --> 00:35:28,717
to purchase and we spoke to some drifting professionals who told us that basically if

514
00:35:28,757 --> 00:35:32,000
we went with the cheaper Korean tyres we were going to get the best sound out of them.

515
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,561
So that was great because it was cheap and it was what we wanted.

516
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:41,142
And we also learnt that the temperature of a tyre completely changes how it sounds.

517
00:35:41,442 --> 00:35:44,943
And this was something we didn't realise until we were on the track and the driver was explaining it to us.

518
00:35:45,783 --> 00:35:51,024
That squealing sound that you get from a tyre is actually when the rubber is cold and it's still making some grip

519
00:35:51,104 --> 00:35:53,104
and it's kind of losing its grip and making grip.

520
00:35:53,565 --> 00:35:55,185
And that's what produces that squealing sound.

521
00:35:55,745 --> 00:35:58,666
When a tyre gets so hot that it's starting to melt and turn soft,

522
00:36:00,026 --> 00:36:02,986
that sound disappears entirely and you get this really cool whizzing sound.

523
00:36:04,017 --> 00:36:07,219
And we were kind of fascinated by this, so we recorded it, and I went back to our designers

524
00:36:07,279 --> 00:36:10,200
and said, is there any chance that you are simulating temperature?

525
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,661
And he's like, yeah, of course.

526
00:36:12,161 --> 00:36:13,822
So we put that into the game.

527
00:36:14,162 --> 00:36:17,443
And in our game, as you're doing burnouts, over time that sound will change based on

528
00:36:17,463 --> 00:36:19,124
the temperature that's simulated of the tire.

529
00:36:20,585 --> 00:36:22,066
And then we repeated the entire process.

530
00:36:22,106 --> 00:36:26,148
We went down the road, did everything all over again, did it on dirt and gravel and

531
00:36:26,188 --> 00:36:27,888
a grass-leaf combination.

532
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:35,262
The two big challenges that we faced during this was as we started to get into the really

533
00:36:35,342 --> 00:36:39,964
high speed whipping around doing burnouts, I was concerned that those suction mounts

534
00:36:39,984 --> 00:36:44,726
were going to fall off and with the mic cable connected the thing was going to swing around

535
00:36:44,766 --> 00:36:46,106
like a wrecking ball and destroy this.

536
00:36:47,995 --> 00:36:48,235
$140,000 car.

537
00:36:48,795 --> 00:36:52,697
So I made a decision at some point to take those mics off and just go with the labs under

538
00:36:52,717 --> 00:36:53,097
the wheels.

539
00:36:53,397 --> 00:36:57,679
And I was a little disappointed because they really were the two best mics we had, but

540
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:03,461
in the nature of protecting and respecting this person's property, we decided to not

541
00:37:03,481 --> 00:37:03,721
do that.

542
00:37:04,581 --> 00:37:06,603
The other big challenge we had is traction control.

543
00:37:07,624 --> 00:37:10,507
This is a modern computer controlled electric car.

544
00:37:11,068 --> 00:37:14,731
Even when you turn the traction control off, it still has a number of systems involved

545
00:37:14,892 --> 00:37:16,733
that are trying to save your life.

546
00:37:16,914 --> 00:37:20,217
And so if you are sliding out of control, it shuts the power down to the engine and

547
00:37:20,237 --> 00:37:22,759
it was really restricting our driver from doing what he wanted to do.

548
00:37:23,998 --> 00:37:28,340
We knew about this early on, and luckily I had a friend that works at this company, and

549
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,702
he told me which fuses and relays to pull out and rearrange to fool the car into doing

550
00:37:33,742 --> 00:37:34,502
what we wanted it to do.

551
00:37:35,322 --> 00:37:36,623
So we kind of lucked out there.

552
00:37:36,863 --> 00:37:38,404
But again, this came down to preparation.

553
00:37:38,644 --> 00:37:42,765
We planned this session three months in advance, so I had maybe 50 conversations with this

554
00:37:42,805 --> 00:37:46,547
engineer about everything I could learn about this car, about what it would do, what it

555
00:37:46,587 --> 00:37:48,588
wouldn't do, and what my limitations were going to be.

556
00:37:51,693 --> 00:37:54,115
I'll show you a real quick video of how some of those recording sessions went.

557
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:03,702
I'm going to play this back just a little quieter just to kind of protect everyone's ears

558
00:38:05,263 --> 00:38:08,666
by the nature of this, how obnoxious this type of sound can be.

559
00:39:41,189 --> 00:39:43,350
It was a really fun day, we were really happy with the results.

560
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:45,051
Everything turned out exactly as we'd planned.

561
00:39:46,652 --> 00:39:50,854
What I'd like to do is show you a really quick sample of how that sounds in game, with everything

562
00:39:50,894 --> 00:39:52,815
that we did after the fact.

563
00:39:52,835 --> 00:39:55,576
What you're going to hear in this video is just the road sounds.

564
00:39:55,776 --> 00:39:57,997
Everything else has been disabled, it's just purely the tires.

565
00:39:58,377 --> 00:40:02,059
And I forgot to mention, if the surrounds are working in here, what you're hearing in

566
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,341
the quad speakers right now is a representation of each wheel in the game.

567
00:40:08,222 --> 00:40:09,063
Each wheel on your car.

568
00:41:16,924 --> 00:41:20,346
I don't know if you guys noticed the whizzing sound that kind of comes in and out at different

569
00:41:20,366 --> 00:41:26,911
times and the way we did the driving on the rims, I actually took a jack stand and just

570
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:31,054
connected a contact mic to it and then pointed one other shotgun mic at it and just rubbed

571
00:41:31,074 --> 00:41:34,416
it on the concrete and I was able to kind of create the loops that I wanted of different

572
00:41:34,436 --> 00:41:38,218
intensities and different speeds and kind of jiggled it on concrete and that was a way

573
00:41:38,238 --> 00:41:38,959
to come up with that sound.

574
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:43,554
When it came time to implementation, we were at this real crossroads.

575
00:41:43,654 --> 00:41:45,096
Do we go with a loop-based system?

576
00:41:45,857 --> 00:41:48,821
Granular synthesis is a really popular method that a lot of people are choosing.

577
00:41:50,102 --> 00:41:54,428
We evaluated granular synthesis and there was an off-the-shelf product we could buy

578
00:41:54,608 --> 00:41:57,331
and there were some things we liked about it and some things we didn't like about it.

579
00:41:58,795 --> 00:42:03,198
I didn't have the engineering resources to go and create our own brand new granular synthesis

580
00:42:03,238 --> 00:42:07,821
system so we ended up deciding to go with a very fine detailed loop based system for

581
00:42:07,841 --> 00:42:08,242
this game.

582
00:42:09,162 --> 00:42:12,885
That doesn't mean we won't evaluate that method again in future, and we are evaluating that

583
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:16,647
for future, but for this game we decided to go with a really fine detailed loop.

584
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:24,513
Again we were doing 200 RPM increments from idle to 2000 and then 500 RPM increments up

585
00:42:24,533 --> 00:42:24,993
to redline.

586
00:42:26,452 --> 00:42:29,995
Then we built everything we needed inside of Wyze with switches and blend containers

587
00:42:30,035 --> 00:42:30,716
and RTPCs.

588
00:42:31,897 --> 00:42:36,862
We ended up mixing everything down to a stereo engine, a stereo exhaust and it turned out

589
00:42:36,882 --> 00:42:40,746
the interior perspective camera angle was going to be cut from the game but at the time

590
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,788
of recording we didn't know that so we captured it anyway.

591
00:42:45,911 --> 00:42:49,353
We decided to keep the player's car completely 2D.

592
00:42:49,874 --> 00:42:53,436
Even though it's a third-person game and the car is kind of out there in front of you,

593
00:42:53,456 --> 00:42:57,218
you know, the camera moves around a lot, the car's spinning around a lot.

594
00:42:57,719 --> 00:43:01,341
Our camera had this really kind of chasing Dutch tilt kind of system going on

595
00:43:01,961 --> 00:43:05,224
and it was really kind of distracting for the player to hear their engine moving around so much.

596
00:43:05,284 --> 00:43:09,006
So we decided to keep everything in 2D and then completely change the mix state

597
00:43:09,566 --> 00:43:11,268
based on the camera angle that the player chose.

598
00:43:12,718 --> 00:43:17,862
3D cars of course were, sorry NPC cars were of course 3D and we had the original goal

599
00:43:17,882 --> 00:43:22,265
of keeping them just as high fidelity as everything else and again reality set in that we couldn't

600
00:43:22,285 --> 00:43:27,429
do that so we ended up having to optimise them and ship them with a mono single engine

601
00:43:27,469 --> 00:43:28,270
exhaust combination.

602
00:43:29,631 --> 00:43:33,273
We had some performance concerns and it was really more important to me to hear more cars

603
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:37,517
at once on the road in a traffic situation than to just have two or three cars sound

604
00:43:38,257 --> 00:43:39,458
as high as fidelity as possible.

605
00:43:40,523 --> 00:43:41,644
So that was one of our limitations.

606
00:43:42,685 --> 00:43:47,850
With tires, we shared those recordings, we did a slight pitch shift based on the size

607
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:48,270
of the car.

608
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:52,054
So trucks, we would pitch down and get a deeper howl and we'd pitch up for small cars.

609
00:43:53,115 --> 00:43:57,239
Each wheel was tracked independently in the game, so each wheel plays the appropriate

610
00:43:57,279 --> 00:43:58,019
surface that you're on.

611
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:02,103
And then for NPCs, we optimized by playing just the one wheel closest to you.

612
00:44:02,263 --> 00:44:02,924
And that was plenty.

613
00:44:06,948 --> 00:44:10,430
We were really lucky in that our design and engineering team made this really amazing

614
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:13,091
physics-based driving model that was built upon from Mafia 2.

615
00:44:13,831 --> 00:44:16,633
And so we had access to a huge wealth of information.

616
00:44:16,653 --> 00:44:21,055
You know, I won't go through every single one in detail, but the couple that I'll call

617
00:44:21,135 --> 00:44:26,838
out was we were able to do the jake brake on the truck by knowing the engine load, the

618
00:44:26,858 --> 00:44:31,401
clutch position, and the angle if the truck was only pointing its nose downhill.

619
00:44:31,521 --> 00:44:33,862
And so that allowed us to do everything we wanted to inside of Wwise.

620
00:44:39,845 --> 00:44:44,529
was spinning at a slower rotational speed relative to what it should be going for the

621
00:44:44,569 --> 00:44:46,810
vehicle speed, then we knew we were skidding to a halt.

622
00:44:47,391 --> 00:44:50,753
If it was running at a higher rotational speed, we knew we were doing a burnout.

623
00:44:51,014 --> 00:44:53,756
And of course, if it was drifting sideways, we had that information as well.

624
00:44:54,577 --> 00:44:59,180
So what you can see there is a series of blend containers nested inside of other blend containers.

625
00:44:59,761 --> 00:45:05,105
And using some RTPCs, we were able to build all of our drifting and burnouts and tire

626
00:45:05,145 --> 00:45:06,966
temperature simulation all inside of Wwise.

627
00:45:10,982 --> 00:45:14,885
And then in closing, I'd like to show you just a really quick clip of kind of everything

628
00:45:15,226 --> 00:45:16,046
culminated together.

629
00:45:16,386 --> 00:45:21,471
This is kind of the best driving experience that we strived for and what we thought we

630
00:45:21,511 --> 00:45:23,553
could deliver in Mafia III, so I hope you enjoy this.

631
00:46:08,538 --> 00:46:10,798
However, Google has recognized that MAGIC is not the only way out of this hell.

632
00:46:10,818 --> 00:46:11,279
Without further ado,

633
00:46:11,299 --> 00:46:11,659
May the

634
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:11,799
purple

635
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:11,919
reap

636
00:46:11,939 --> 00:46:11,999
the

637
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:12,299
Koh-i-Toon.

638
00:47:21,218 --> 00:47:22,299
This is what the actual engine sound would look like.

639
00:48:13,969 --> 00:48:14,949
So, thank you all for coming.

640
00:48:14,969 --> 00:48:17,090
I really appreciate you taking the time to get up here.

641
00:48:18,705 --> 00:48:19,605
early on a Friday morning.

642
00:48:20,385 --> 00:48:21,306
I hope you enjoyed that.

643
00:48:21,326 --> 00:48:23,846
I hope you kind of learned something about the process of recording cars.

644
00:48:24,566 --> 00:48:27,667
We have a little bit of time left, so if anyone would like to ask questions, feel free to

645
00:48:27,687 --> 00:48:28,488
come up to the microphone up in front.

646
00:48:28,508 --> 00:48:28,548
Hi.

647
00:48:28,568 --> 00:48:29,768
I'm a fan of the cars, so I'm going to ask a question.

648
00:48:29,788 --> 00:48:30,408
Do you know what a car is?

649
00:48:30,428 --> 00:48:30,548
Yes.

650
00:48:30,568 --> 00:48:30,968
I've heard about it.

651
00:48:30,988 --> 00:48:32,729
I'm not sure how many people have heard about it, but I don't think it's very well-known.

652
00:48:32,749 --> 00:48:34,009
I think it's a car that is typically driven by a man or a woman.

653
00:48:34,029 --> 00:48:35,170
And I think it's a car that is driven by a man or a woman.

654
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:36,330
And I think it's a car that is driven by a man or a woman.

655
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:37,510
And I think it's a car that is driven by a man or a woman.

656
00:48:38,448 --> 00:48:44,610
Hi, great talk. I was just curious about the tire recording session, what was the tape

657
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:50,132
for around the tires? It appeared to be tape.

658
00:48:50,752 --> 00:48:56,054
There was two purposes. One was to tape the mic cables down and the other was just a stone

659
00:48:56,094 --> 00:48:58,755
protection. The technician we worked with

660
00:48:59,505 --> 00:49:02,788
But particularly it's blue painter's tape which doesn't leave any kind of glue residue

661
00:49:02,828 --> 00:49:05,930
behind because we were conscious of not damaging the paint.

662
00:49:06,831 --> 00:49:10,394
But he basically said, you know, if we tape up certain areas of the car, this is where

663
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:12,856
all the stone chips are going to come from, this is where all the dirt's going to get

664
00:49:12,897 --> 00:49:13,277
kicked up.

665
00:49:13,357 --> 00:49:16,880
So particularly when we recorded on the gravel road, that was something we wanted to do to

666
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:17,681
just protect the car.

667
00:49:18,381 --> 00:49:20,323
But it also served as taping down mic cables.

668
00:49:20,343 --> 00:49:21,224
Awesome.

669
00:49:21,244 --> 00:49:21,544
Thank you.

670
00:49:21,564 --> 00:49:21,704
Yeah.

671
00:49:21,924 --> 00:49:22,085
Thanks.

672
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:29,940
When recording these cars on a DynaPak for instance, did you have to have hub adapters

673
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:34,023
made for some of the cars for like the bolt patterns to get them to match up?

674
00:49:34,484 --> 00:49:39,447
So the workshop had standard four and five bolt patterns and those adapters are adjustable

675
00:49:39,487 --> 00:49:40,148
for certain widths.

676
00:49:41,068 --> 00:49:45,752
We did have a special Volkswagen adapter made but it turned out we weren't permitted to

677
00:49:45,832 --> 00:49:48,214
use Volkswagen recordings so we had to throw that away.

678
00:49:49,058 --> 00:49:50,880
There are some brands out there that trademark their sound.

679
00:49:50,961 --> 00:49:53,684
So we learned over time there were certain cars we couldn't use.

680
00:49:54,826 --> 00:49:57,529
And then it was really just that McLaren that we had the special adapter made.

681
00:49:57,930 --> 00:50:02,916
But everything else we searched for cars that fit that particular bolt pattern.

682
00:50:02,936 --> 00:50:06,441
And then sometimes we would unfortunately have to turn down cars if they weren't going to fit.

683
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:15,861
Sorry, I have a question as well.

684
00:50:16,101 --> 00:50:16,241
Hi.

685
00:50:16,861 --> 00:50:21,925
Um, so you said that you recorded 30 different vehicles, but you used 90 in the game.

686
00:50:22,085 --> 00:50:25,487
Were you like mixing and matching sounds from different recordings?

687
00:50:25,547 --> 00:50:29,429
A little bit, a little bit. Mostly it was just we just shared those recordings across the 90.

688
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,611
So you just had like 30 like archetypes for vehicles and then...

689
00:50:32,951 --> 00:50:36,594
Pretty much, yeah. And then we would choose what we thought sounded the best or most appropriate based on...

690
00:50:37,114 --> 00:50:39,896
You know, the designers were tweaking what the performance of that car was going to...

691
00:50:39,916 --> 00:50:41,517
what the virtual performance of that car was going to be,

692
00:50:41,557 --> 00:50:43,218
so we would choose what we thought sounded the best.

693
00:50:43,995 --> 00:50:44,456
Cool, thank you.

694
00:50:44,936 --> 00:50:45,317
Thanks.

695
00:50:48,302 --> 00:50:52,489
During the recording session out on the track um...

696
00:50:53,786 --> 00:50:59,910
What did you use in terms of multi-track and like 64 gigabyte cards?

697
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:02,972
Did you just press record and just record all day long?

698
00:51:03,492 --> 00:51:04,013
For the tires?

699
00:51:04,293 --> 00:51:05,214
Yeah.

700
00:51:05,374 --> 00:51:10,437
We had a sound device, 788T, and we had one person sitting in the passenger seat recording.

701
00:51:11,157 --> 00:51:16,221
So we would use radio communication to talk back to our producer and tell her this is

702
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:17,882
what maneuvers we're about to do next.

703
00:51:18,662 --> 00:51:19,663
And then she would note.

704
00:51:20,551 --> 00:51:25,954
Note that and we'd talk time code back and forth across the radio and if we were forgetting

705
00:51:26,014 --> 00:51:29,015
something she would say, look, on your list you've got these three more things you haven't

706
00:51:29,035 --> 00:51:29,335
done yet.

707
00:51:29,975 --> 00:51:32,236
And so we were just communicating over radio that way.

708
00:51:32,937 --> 00:51:36,799
The radio was really mainly meant to be a safety feature, you know, if something caught

709
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:38,679
on fire or fell off we would have someone tell us.

710
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:42,921
But it also served as a way to kind of prompt us of what to do for whoever was sitting in

711
00:51:42,961 --> 00:51:43,482
the car itself.

712
00:51:47,715 --> 00:51:48,918
Cool, well thank you everyone for coming.

713
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,363
Enjoy the rest of your GDC.

714
00:51:51,045 --> 00:51:52,469
Really appreciate you taking the time to be here.
