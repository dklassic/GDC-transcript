1
00:00:11,488 --> 00:00:16,749
My name is Yesenia Cisneros, and I am the lead producer at Brassline Entertainment.

2
00:00:16,749 --> 00:00:17,909
And thank you, thank you.

3
00:00:17,909 --> 00:00:22,851
And today I'm going to be talking to you about production and empathy and how it can help

4
00:00:22,851 --> 00:00:25,871
you build a strong studio culture.

5
00:00:25,871 --> 00:00:29,392
But first, let me figure out how this thing works, because it's off.

6
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:37,258
Allow me to reintroduce myself since most of y'all have never heard of me before up until today.

7
00:00:37,258 --> 00:00:39,341
So I was born in Queens, New York.

8
00:00:39,341 --> 00:00:45,488
My family is from Ecuador and China, which makes me Ecuadorian American with a splash of Chinese.

9
00:00:45,488 --> 00:00:50,534
And I've been in this industry for 13 years.

10
00:00:50,534 --> 00:00:50,634
My.

11
00:00:52,013 --> 00:00:54,834
My journey into the industry started back in 2009

12
00:00:54,834 --> 00:00:57,436
as a Xbox Live enforcer.

13
00:00:57,436 --> 00:00:59,157
And from there, I went over into QA,

14
00:00:59,157 --> 00:01:02,278
working on titles as Batman Arkham City,

15
00:01:02,278 --> 00:01:06,020
Fear 3, and Mortal Kombat.

16
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,781
At that time, I really enjoyed working with people

17
00:01:08,781 --> 00:01:11,823
and problem solving and making sure

18
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:13,404
that everyone's talking to each other,

19
00:01:13,404 --> 00:01:14,724
working towards a common goal.

20
00:01:14,724 --> 00:01:18,707
And so that is when I figured out I wanted to be a producer.

21
00:01:18,707 --> 00:01:20,587
But what does a producer actually do?

22
00:01:21,563 --> 00:01:26,688
So at that time when I started my career, I really didn't know what a producer does since

23
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:32,553
I really didn't know anyone that I can talk to in my circle. I was just starting now, just moved to

24
00:01:32,553 --> 00:01:37,017
Seattle after deciding to not be a doctor and moved halfway across the country, disappointing

25
00:01:37,017 --> 00:01:45,204
my parents. And then I ended up learning a lot of what I did on the job over many years in the studio.

26
00:01:46,128 --> 00:01:53,317
And so today I'm going to briefly chat with you about what a producer does before we get into further details.

27
00:01:53,317 --> 00:01:56,781
And where are my team members at? All right, I see them here.

28
00:01:56,781 --> 00:02:00,125
So a lot of them don't know what I actually do for work.

29
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:03,289
So this is mostly for them so they can start taking notes.

30
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,711
There'll be a quiz at the end of this.

31
00:02:06,424 --> 00:02:09,607
So a producer, we wear a lot of many different hats.

32
00:02:09,607 --> 00:02:11,669
We wear the role of being a cheerleader

33
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:13,911
where we're constantly motivating the team,

34
00:02:13,911 --> 00:02:15,833
making sure everyone is high spirits,

35
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,495
keeping a pulse on the team health

36
00:02:17,495 --> 00:02:21,078
because we are tracking the day-to-day with everyone.

37
00:02:21,078 --> 00:02:22,459
We also do a lot of cat herding

38
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:24,702
because surprisingly enough, a lot of devs

39
00:02:25,737 --> 00:02:28,138
go work on features, and then they go into

40
00:02:28,138 --> 00:02:29,778
their own little bubbles and silo themselves

41
00:02:29,778 --> 00:02:31,139
and don't actually talk to each other.

42
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:33,740
So, kind of, we have to bring them all together

43
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,240
and make sure that they're talking to each other

44
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,841
so we can actually do the job right.

45
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:40,242
And we're also constantly removing roadblocks from everyone

46
00:02:40,242 --> 00:02:42,023
in order to keep the train moving

47
00:02:42,023 --> 00:02:46,045
just so they don't get blocked, essentially.

48
00:02:46,045 --> 00:02:49,326
I like to think of us producers as more of a support role,

49
00:02:49,326 --> 00:02:51,106
boosting everyone's performance around us.

50
00:02:52,177 --> 00:02:56,720
I also like to look at us as composers where we're taking all the features individually

51
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,543
and bringing them together into one beautiful user experience for our players.

52
00:03:00,543 --> 00:03:04,385
So over the many years that I've been doing this.

53
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:09,554
Everyone I've worked with has always rolled their eyes at producers.

54
00:03:09,554 --> 00:03:10,815
They hate producers.

55
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,575
They haven't had good experiences with them.

56
00:03:12,575 --> 00:03:18,877
And these are industry vets that have been doing this for 18 to 20 plus years.

57
00:03:18,877 --> 00:03:22,138
And not to toot my own horn, but I totally am gonna.

58
00:03:22,913 --> 00:03:27,156
Everywhere I've worked, they've told me that I am the best producer they've worked with

59
00:03:27,156 --> 00:03:29,838
and the best production team they've ever worked with.

60
00:03:29,838 --> 00:03:35,021
So it kind of had me wondering, what am I doing so much differently than other producers

61
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:35,782
in this industry?

62
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:38,464
I was leading with empathy.

63
00:03:39,614 --> 00:03:42,296
So what does that mean exactly?

64
00:03:42,296 --> 00:03:45,519
For me, it comes so natural and second nature for me

65
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,961
that I had to really take a step back and think

66
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,083
what does leading with empathy mean

67
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:53,166
other than making sure the team feels valued and cared for.

68
00:03:54,415 --> 00:03:59,157
It sounds pretty simple enough, but a lot of people actually forget that in our industry,

69
00:03:59,157 --> 00:04:02,859
especially when you're meeting tight deadlines and trying to get across the finish line,

70
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:07,802
you're working possibly publishers or like anything else, any other factors.

71
00:04:07,802 --> 00:04:13,245
So, these are kind of some principles that I put together myself because I was trying to figure out

72
00:04:13,245 --> 00:04:17,667
what am I doing differently, and hopefully that'll help some of you today if you're either a producer

73
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:22,350
or wanting to go into production, or maybe you can say, hey producer in your studio,

74
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,031
have you thought about doing this?

75
00:04:24,751 --> 00:04:28,212
So first off, show a genuine interest in their work.

76
00:04:28,212 --> 00:04:35,774
Devs love talking about their work and showing that you care about their craft plays attention

77
00:04:35,774 --> 00:04:37,015
to detail for them.

78
00:04:37,015 --> 00:04:41,856
This not only helps you with learning on the job and learning all the technical jargon

79
00:04:41,856 --> 00:04:46,318
and how the game development cycle works, which is how I learned is by asking a ton

80
00:04:46,318 --> 00:04:47,078
of questions.

81
00:04:47,942 --> 00:04:52,604
But it also helps you as a producer to put together a roadmap and timeline when you're

82
00:04:52,604 --> 00:04:57,667
planning because now you know how the feature works from end to end, what dependencies there

83
00:04:57,667 --> 00:05:02,249
are, and it helps avoid setting any arbitrary dates.

84
00:05:02,249 --> 00:05:03,469
Be human.

85
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:07,911
So this is also really simple, yet people forget about this.

86
00:05:07,911 --> 00:05:11,953
We as devs are not cogs in a machine.

87
00:05:11,953 --> 00:05:15,114
We don't just take a task in and output.

88
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:17,235
So we have to understand that.

89
00:05:17,545 --> 00:05:20,086
These are real people with real emotions and struggles,

90
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:22,927
and sometimes life stuff happens.

91
00:05:22,927 --> 00:05:27,368
And everywhere I've worked in over various industries,

92
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,609
it's always been leave your stuff at home

93
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:31,990
and only focus on work.

94
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,110
Sometimes that's really difficult to do.

95
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,251
You can't just separate them.

96
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,691
They're kind of intertwined.

97
00:05:36,691 --> 00:05:39,172
Especially right now for most of us,

98
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,892
we work in a remote environment

99
00:05:40,892 --> 00:05:43,633
where our office is our personal home.

100
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:46,334
So what I mean by being human is,

101
00:05:47,562 --> 00:05:50,823
make sure to put the people first before the work.

102
00:05:50,823 --> 00:05:52,744
Encourage them to take a mental health day.

103
00:05:52,744 --> 00:05:56,145
Encourage them to go outside for a walk.

104
00:05:56,145 --> 00:05:57,826
I know I have to do that sometimes.

105
00:05:57,826 --> 00:05:59,507
I also have to take mental health breaks

106
00:05:59,507 --> 00:06:01,047
when I just am overwhelmed.

107
00:06:01,047 --> 00:06:03,949
And then also, on my team specifically,

108
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:05,909
we have a lot of working parents.

109
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:09,271
We're very cognizant of that and we make sure it's like,

110
00:06:09,271 --> 00:06:10,771
yeah, you need to go take a half day

111
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:13,052
or you need to go take care of your family stuff.

112
00:06:13,052 --> 00:06:13,613
Go ahead and do it.

113
00:06:13,613 --> 00:06:16,914
Always put people before the work.

114
00:06:18,386 --> 00:06:20,607
Next thing is build a connection with your team.

115
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:26,325
don't make everything be about status updates with them.

116
00:06:26,325 --> 00:06:28,966
Don't constantly ask them, what's the status on this?

117
00:06:28,966 --> 00:06:31,886
Did you update your JIRA or anything like that?

118
00:06:31,886 --> 00:06:35,607
And you'll know that you're this producer

119
00:06:35,607 --> 00:06:37,908
if you start, when you ping someone on Slack

120
00:06:37,908 --> 00:06:39,869
or any other messaging app,

121
00:06:39,869 --> 00:06:41,809
and the first thing they say is,

122
00:06:41,809 --> 00:06:43,650
what do you need or what did I do?

123
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,310
So if you get those responses,

124
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,911
definitely you have to change and pivot

125
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:49,551
to have more non-work conversations.

126
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:50,292
I love.

127
00:06:51,835 --> 00:06:53,196
roasting my team a lot.

128
00:06:53,196 --> 00:06:57,158
I love making fun of them and having jokes.

129
00:06:57,158 --> 00:06:58,138
And it's great.

130
00:06:58,138 --> 00:07:00,859
And it just kind of helps build that rapport.

131
00:07:00,859 --> 00:07:03,341
And something that we did at Brass Line

132
00:07:03,341 --> 00:07:06,682
is we implemented Coffee Time on Monday,

133
00:07:06,682 --> 00:07:08,823
where we meet together as a team,

134
00:07:08,823 --> 00:07:11,304
chat for 30 minutes about non-work stuff.

135
00:07:11,304 --> 00:07:12,965
And this is how we just catch up

136
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,986
on what we did over the weekend.

137
00:07:14,986 --> 00:07:17,187
And something our lovely art producer did for us is

138
00:07:17,867 --> 00:07:21,369
also set up Donut Time, which is an app that gets integrated

139
00:07:21,369 --> 00:07:24,091
into Slack where you can get randomly paired

140
00:07:24,091 --> 00:07:25,311
with another team member.

141
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:28,693
And this also allows for more of the human connection

142
00:07:28,693 --> 00:07:30,574
that especially that we're not getting right now.

143
00:07:30,574 --> 00:07:34,076
And so this is how you build a connection with your team

144
00:07:34,076 --> 00:07:35,837
and it helps build that rapport.

145
00:07:37,175 --> 00:07:40,117
which takes us into making it a safe environment.

146
00:07:40,117 --> 00:07:44,600
Now, when I say make it a safe environment for everyone,

147
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,202
all devs want to feel seen and heard

148
00:07:47,202 --> 00:07:48,923
and want to be treated with respect.

149
00:07:48,923 --> 00:07:51,385
And so what I've done with everyone is I,

150
00:07:51,385 --> 00:07:54,607
regardless if they're a QA tester or they're a director

151
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:57,288
or whatever, a VP, I've always treated everyone

152
00:07:57,288 --> 00:07:59,350
with the same amount of respect.

153
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,532
And that has helped build a safe environment for all.

154
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:08,619
So, it helps bring their authentic selves every day and then also they feel a little

155
00:08:08,619 --> 00:08:12,463
bit more comfortable talking to you about any other problems that may arise.

156
00:08:12,463 --> 00:08:17,249
You want to continue to have that open line of communication with everyone.

157
00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:19,231
And lastly, be transparent with everyone.

158
00:08:20,816 --> 00:08:23,057
No one likes top-down management,

159
00:08:23,057 --> 00:08:25,979
or I like to call pigeon management,

160
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:28,240
where you just kind of swoop in shit on everyone's idea

161
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,461
and then swoop right off.

162
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:34,063
So I like to be super transparent with my team,

163
00:08:34,063 --> 00:08:38,105
even when there's deadlines or I have to pivot

164
00:08:38,105 --> 00:08:40,306
on any kind of planning that we originally thought of,

165
00:08:40,306 --> 00:08:42,987
anything like that, I always involve them in the process,

166
00:08:42,987 --> 00:08:44,388
I explain to them what the situation is.

167
00:08:45,548 --> 00:08:48,049
and we work on a solution together.

168
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:50,870
When you're doing this, all of these stuff,

169
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,830
essentially it all adds up together

170
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,811
and they're intertwined because when the team feels

171
00:08:55,811 --> 00:08:57,831
like you have their back, they will have your back.

172
00:08:57,831 --> 00:09:00,752
There's so many, there's been so many times

173
00:09:00,752 --> 00:09:03,632
where I have had to solve a hard problem

174
00:09:03,632 --> 00:09:05,713
and I go to my team like, this is really shitty,

175
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:06,773
we need to figure this out.

176
00:09:06,773 --> 00:09:07,533
And you know what?

177
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:09,133
More often than not, they're like,

178
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:10,194
yep, Yesenia, we got your back,

179
00:09:10,194 --> 00:09:11,574
we're gonna help you figure this out.

180
00:09:12,481 --> 00:09:16,765
So, in conclusion, don't separate the work from the person.

181
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,247
You wanna make sure that you create a sense of belonging

182
00:09:19,247 --> 00:09:23,691
for everyone, and even when shit hits the fan,

183
00:09:23,691 --> 00:09:26,053
make sure it's even more crucial to follow that.

184
00:09:26,053 --> 00:09:29,136
Because we all have deadlines, and that's okay,

185
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:31,598
but when that happens, take a deep breath,

186
00:09:31,598 --> 00:09:35,102
pause, figure out how you're gonna come across

187
00:09:35,102 --> 00:09:35,922
and fix a solution.

188
00:09:37,028 --> 00:09:38,469
pause before you respond to someone

189
00:09:38,469 --> 00:09:40,790
because if you say something impulsively

190
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,292
or act impulsively, it could create more detriment

191
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,453
to the overall goal.

192
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:47,235
And this is how you lead with empathy.

193
00:09:47,235 --> 00:09:47,895
Thank you so much.

194
00:09:47,895 --> 00:09:48,215
Thank you.

195
00:09:48,215 --> 00:09:51,898
Thank you.

196
00:09:51,898 --> 00:09:57,521
Thank you.

197
00:09:57,521 --> 00:09:57,982
Thank you.

198
00:09:57,982 --> 00:09:59,122
Hi.

199
00:09:59,122 --> 00:10:00,283
Welcome to GDC.

200
00:10:00,283 --> 00:10:02,585
Hope you guys are having a great day.

201
00:10:02,585 --> 00:10:04,546
My name is Karl Kuo and today I'm gonna talk to you

202
00:10:04,546 --> 00:10:06,287
about how behavior drives your culture.

203
00:10:07,383 --> 00:10:18,750
I've had the experience and privilege of working at a bunch of mission and values driven companies that are not showing up completely correctly on the slide, but it's fine.

204
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,052
I'm sure you can all LinkedIn stalk me if you wish.

205
00:10:22,052 --> 00:10:29,477
And through working at those studios, I've developed a lot of opinions and had a lot of experience of

206
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,763
how the words on the web page or on the wall

207
00:10:32,763 --> 00:10:34,884
map into what actually is experienced

208
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,846
day to day on the culture.

209
00:10:36,846 --> 00:10:39,208
And I had the experience of being able to talk to a friend

210
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,450
who was thinking of starting their own studio.

211
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,571
And I drew this Post-it note,

212
00:10:42,571 --> 00:10:45,393
like literally this is a picture of the Post-it note,

213
00:10:45,393 --> 00:10:47,375
to start explaining like, hey, yeah,

214
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,376
it matters what you put on those places,

215
00:10:49,376 --> 00:10:51,098
but what matters more is how you behave

216
00:10:51,098 --> 00:10:55,601
and how you think about your behavior in the workplace.

217
00:10:55,601 --> 00:10:58,744
And I've given that conversation or that soapbox talk,

218
00:10:58,744 --> 00:10:59,545
as I like to call them.

219
00:10:59,915 --> 00:11:06,521
a few times, and it sort of morphed into this GDC presentation.

220
00:11:06,521 --> 00:11:09,003
It starts with, you are what you do.

221
00:11:09,003 --> 00:11:12,646
Your behavior is what's going to drive the culture around you at every studio.

222
00:11:12,646 --> 00:11:17,631
A lot of this is because human beings tend to be observational learners.

223
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,912
They mimic what they see.

224
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:23,056
They look at how you behave, and they're going to try to emulate it, because that's how humans

225
00:11:23,056 --> 00:11:25,018
start to understand the social norms around them.

226
00:11:25,812 --> 00:11:28,393
When they read the definitions of the words

227
00:11:28,393 --> 00:11:30,594
or they read your mission or your value statements,

228
00:11:30,594 --> 00:11:32,696
they're going to inform what the actual definitions

229
00:11:32,696 --> 00:11:35,497
you're using, what the colloquial definitions you're using

230
00:11:35,497 --> 00:11:36,938
through watching your behavior.

231
00:11:36,938 --> 00:11:38,639
And it's not just when you're at your best

232
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:39,980
when you're in presentation mode,

233
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,281
during times of stress, during times of crisis,

234
00:11:42,281 --> 00:11:43,742
when you're at your worst,

235
00:11:43,742 --> 00:11:45,784
when you're thinking about your runway

236
00:11:45,784 --> 00:11:48,265
and acting out because you just got off the phone

237
00:11:48,265 --> 00:11:49,406
with your investor,

238
00:11:49,406 --> 00:11:50,967
that behavior is what people are gonna be,

239
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:53,048
ah, these are the bounds of the social norms.

240
00:11:53,048 --> 00:11:53,848
This is how I'm going.

241
00:11:55,130 --> 00:12:01,540
As an example, I was at a studio that had Candor as one of their values, and they talked

242
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:06,208
a lot about giving direct feedback and always being very transparent with the people that

243
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,496
you interact with as a way to improve the culture.

244
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:12,757
We did stuff during onboarding with this.

245
00:12:12,757 --> 00:12:17,758
And I gave a presentation one day to one of the CEOs.

246
00:12:17,758 --> 00:12:22,080
And what happened was that during that presentation,

247
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,261
the feedback was very positive, overall went well.

248
00:12:24,261 --> 00:12:28,122
About a week later, through one-on-one with my manager,

249
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,923
I started to get a lot of feedback of, hey,

250
00:12:29,923 --> 00:12:31,283
you could have done this better.

251
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:32,683
This wasn't quite working.

252
00:12:32,683 --> 00:12:34,724
Your presentation skills here weren't great,

253
00:12:34,724 --> 00:12:36,185
which was odd because that.

254
00:12:36,425 --> 00:12:38,947
that manager hadn't been in that presentation.

255
00:12:38,947 --> 00:12:42,109
And what ended up being the case was a lot of that feedback

256
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:44,911
from that leader, that most senior leadership group,

257
00:12:44,911 --> 00:12:46,332
was coming through secondhand.

258
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,994
And it started with this leader who

259
00:12:48,994 --> 00:12:51,676
did that not just with anyone who came to him,

260
00:12:51,676 --> 00:12:53,877
but also all of his direct reports.

261
00:12:53,877 --> 00:12:56,459
And in turn, his direct reports saw that behavior

262
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:59,821
and was like, ah, this is what we mean by feedback culture.

263
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,042
I will follow that in suit.

264
00:13:01,042 --> 00:13:02,243
And they began to act in this.

265
00:13:02,734 --> 00:13:07,756
And over time, what was represented as candor as culture became more of a,

266
00:13:07,756 --> 00:13:09,277
what is the narrative behind my back?

267
00:13:09,277 --> 00:13:14,119
What is the feedback I'm going to get unexpectedly weeks after I give a presentation

268
00:13:14,119 --> 00:13:16,660
or have a big moment in the studio?

269
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,721
You'll notice in that example that it started with one person's behavior

270
00:13:19,721 --> 00:13:21,602
and then started to propagate.

271
00:13:21,602 --> 00:13:24,563
And this is because you are what you tolerate.

272
00:13:24,563 --> 00:13:25,984
As people learn and...

273
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,384
start to behave within your studio, they're going to not just have behaviors that they're

274
00:13:31,384 --> 00:13:36,229
mimicking from people that they see around them, but also we all have habits and behaviors

275
00:13:36,229 --> 00:13:39,432
that we've learned from previous studios or even from school.

276
00:13:39,432 --> 00:13:43,357
And those habits are going to come in and are going to be default behaviors for people

277
00:13:43,357 --> 00:13:44,498
as they're learning the system.

278
00:13:45,526 --> 00:13:48,647
If you let those behaviors stand, that starts to map out

279
00:13:48,647 --> 00:13:50,288
what are the boundaries of the social norms

280
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:52,369
and will become your culture as well.

281
00:13:52,369 --> 00:13:56,031
You have to be present and watching and intervene quickly

282
00:13:56,031 --> 00:13:58,332
when behaviors are outside of the boundaries

283
00:13:58,332 --> 00:14:00,173
of what you want within your culture.

284
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:04,715
And with kindness, with empathy, as Yesenia mentioned,

285
00:14:04,715 --> 00:14:07,156
intervene and course correct that behavior

286
00:14:07,156 --> 00:14:09,917
so that it more closely matches the culture

287
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:12,318
you want in your studio.

288
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:15,120
This example has actually happened at multiple studios.

289
00:14:15,739 --> 00:14:20,942
where you end up in multiple offices, multiple locations, or multiple teams.

290
00:14:20,942 --> 00:14:25,085
And oftentimes studios will talk about wanting to have a one team culture.

291
00:14:25,085 --> 00:14:29,548
You don't want silos between the various game teams or the various locations.

292
00:14:29,548 --> 00:14:34,010
At some studios I've had, the language begins to...

293
00:14:34,602 --> 00:14:35,623
go into shorthand.

294
00:14:35,623 --> 00:14:38,826
It's very easy to say, oh, the LA team, or oh, the Montreal

295
00:14:38,826 --> 00:14:41,949
team, or game two team thinks this.

296
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:45,392
The other really common one is leadership thinks this,

297
00:14:45,392 --> 00:14:47,113
or management thinks that.

298
00:14:47,113 --> 00:14:50,456
And when that language stands, when we all fall

299
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,039
into the behavior and it's OK to use that shorthand,

300
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:54,540
we start to develop silos.

301
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,662
Because it's a very othering language,

302
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,504
it makes it this amorphous group,

303
00:14:58,504 --> 00:15:00,086
and everyone thinks the same thing.

304
00:15:00,646 --> 00:15:04,809
What we've tried to do at Phoenix Labs, where I'm at today, is try to intervene.

305
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:10,914
When I hear that language, I go, like, hey, I'm pretty sure the city of Montreal doesn't think that.

306
00:15:10,914 --> 00:15:12,595
Who on that team is saying these things, right?

307
00:15:12,595 --> 00:15:17,399
Like, how can we get better details there to intervene more quickly if there's an issue?

308
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:22,563
Or who could you connect with specifically in that regard to build a better relationship?

309
00:15:22,563 --> 00:15:26,686
Similarly, for, you know, if we're talking about specific game teams or LA.

310
00:15:26,686 --> 00:15:28,527
But also, you know, I am.

311
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,802
you know, honored to be considered a leader at the studio.

312
00:15:32,802 --> 00:15:34,543
And I'll be like, hey, you know,

313
00:15:34,543 --> 00:15:36,244
I didn't attend a leadership meeting

314
00:15:36,244 --> 00:15:38,085
where we all voted to agree on the same thing

315
00:15:38,085 --> 00:15:39,085
and speak with one voice.

316
00:15:39,085 --> 00:15:41,727
So could you help me understand where this is coming from?

317
00:15:41,727 --> 00:15:43,648
Which leader did you hear that from

318
00:15:43,648 --> 00:15:46,149
so that we can better solve the issue?

319
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:49,391
And that has really helped keep us feeling

320
00:15:49,391 --> 00:15:51,392
more like one team with fewer walls

321
00:15:51,392 --> 00:15:53,133
between locations and between games.

322
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,462
You'll, in that example, that's a lot of me going

323
00:15:58,462 --> 00:16:01,163
and seeing that moment and going and spending

324
00:16:01,163 --> 00:16:01,843
one time to fix it.

325
00:16:01,843 --> 00:16:05,385
And this is the sad truth of this,

326
00:16:05,385 --> 00:16:07,526
that wraps up this talk, which is,

327
00:16:07,526 --> 00:16:08,767
you are the work you put in, right?

328
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,968
There isn't a really easy way to scale this.

329
00:16:10,968 --> 00:16:13,529
I can't, unfortunately, I wish I could be like,

330
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:16,730
run these three meetings and have these five bullet points

331
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,051
and you're good, right?

332
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:20,872
Unfortunately, it's about being present and being perceptive.

333
00:16:21,232 --> 00:16:27,376
giving direct, timely, and specific feedback every time you notice a behavior that is off course from the culture that you want,

334
00:16:27,376 --> 00:16:33,560
being able to reinforce those pithy statements of your mission and your values with nuance and examples,

335
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:40,024
and really give those words more meaning through really specific examples of the behavior.

336
00:16:41,505 --> 00:16:44,728
And it doesn't scale, it just requires effort.

337
00:16:44,728 --> 00:16:47,390
And ideally, every leader at your organization,

338
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:51,214
and I hope that you have cast that with a wide net of anyone

339
00:16:51,214 --> 00:16:52,815
at your studio can be a leader.

340
00:16:52,815 --> 00:16:55,497
Hopefully, they're all putting this work in.

341
00:16:55,497 --> 00:16:57,379
But the only thing you can directly control is you.

342
00:16:57,379 --> 00:17:00,682
And so my call to action to you is really,

343
00:17:00,682 --> 00:17:02,163
you have to put the time and you have

344
00:17:02,163 --> 00:17:04,446
to put the work in to shape the behavior that creates

345
00:17:04,446 --> 00:17:05,426
the culture of your studio.

346
00:17:05,426 --> 00:17:07,308
And that's my talk.

347
00:17:07,308 --> 00:17:07,608
Thank you.

348
00:17:17,082 --> 00:17:18,903
Hi, I'm Christopher McGeorge.

349
00:17:18,903 --> 00:17:21,605
I'm the Chief Operating Officer for Wild Blue Studios.

350
00:17:21,605 --> 00:17:23,327
We're an external art development partner,

351
00:17:23,327 --> 00:17:26,969
and we're a little different than most of the other studios

352
00:17:26,969 --> 00:17:28,891
that you'll meet at GDC this week

353
00:17:28,891 --> 00:17:30,712
because we are a worker-owned cooperative.

354
00:17:30,712 --> 00:17:35,036
That means a few things that I'll talk about today,

355
00:17:35,036 --> 00:17:36,857
specifically something we call

356
00:17:36,857 --> 00:17:39,319
horizontal structure and vertical deployment.

357
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:42,082
I'll be talking about how we use those two

358
00:17:42,082 --> 00:17:43,262
to empower our workers and create

359
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,443
a positive company culture.

360
00:17:45,547 --> 00:17:48,748
And I'm sure you've all heard of vertical and horizontal

361
00:17:48,748 --> 00:17:51,688
structures, vertical being decisions made at the top,

362
00:17:51,688 --> 00:17:53,829
handed down to execute, top-down sort of structure.

363
00:17:53,829 --> 00:17:56,650
Horizontal, you flatten that a little bit,

364
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,650
so some of those decisions are made more laterally,

365
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,771
a little more collaboratively.

366
00:18:00,771 --> 00:18:02,792
You still have this sort of person at the top

367
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:05,072
or that sort of hierarchy of power.

368
00:18:05,072 --> 00:18:08,133
At Wild Blue, we're fully horizontal.

369
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:10,254
We each own an equal part of the studio.

370
00:18:10,254 --> 00:18:12,955
Every time we hire another employee,

371
00:18:12,955 --> 00:18:14,295
they become another owner.

372
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:20,641
That means that all of our employees then have an equal vote in decisions for things like electing the board.

373
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:24,405
That also means they have an equal vote and power to recall that board.

374
00:18:24,405 --> 00:18:28,830
So there's a lot of accountability built into that structure.

375
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:33,515
You'll also notice back in this example, both in the vertical and the horizontal structure,

376
00:18:33,515 --> 00:18:35,958
there's the person at the top holding the money bags.

377
00:18:37,545 --> 00:18:40,087
In the horizontal structure, because we're all equal owners,

378
00:18:40,087 --> 00:18:42,470
we all share equally in the profit,

379
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,012
or we call it the patronage, at the end of the year.

380
00:18:44,012 --> 00:18:46,474
So that means at the end, we see what our profit is

381
00:18:46,474 --> 00:18:48,697
at the end of the year, we reinvest some of that

382
00:18:48,697 --> 00:18:50,779
back into the cooperative, and then we take

383
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:54,082
a certain percentage of that, and that gets

384
00:18:54,082 --> 00:18:56,245
equally distributed across the studio.

385
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:00,620
Now, we still have vertical deployment,

386
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,002
which is gonna look a lot more familiar to everyone.

387
00:19:03,002 --> 00:19:08,145
We still have an elected, we have a board,

388
00:19:08,145 --> 00:19:09,926
we have senior leadership,

389
00:19:09,926 --> 00:19:12,048
we also have a hierarchy and compensation.

390
00:19:12,048 --> 00:19:16,390
So, right, while we are sharing profit

391
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,932
equally across the board, we aren't compensated equally.

392
00:19:18,932 --> 00:19:22,414
We still recognize differences in skill and experience

393
00:19:22,414 --> 00:19:23,435
and we compensate accordingly.

394
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,126
As you sort of move up this vertical deployment,

395
00:19:26,126 --> 00:19:28,052
you have greater levels of accountability,

396
00:19:28,052 --> 00:19:29,336
responsibility, et cetera.

397
00:19:30,661 --> 00:19:32,963
But we think there are a lot of benefits

398
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,404
to this flat horizontal structure.

399
00:19:34,404 --> 00:19:35,545
So it helps to start to dismantle

400
00:19:35,545 --> 00:19:39,969
some of those hierarchies that you experience.

401
00:19:39,969 --> 00:19:44,954
It makes our senior employees treat our more junior staff

402
00:19:44,954 --> 00:19:46,715
as equals, as peers.

403
00:19:46,715 --> 00:19:49,758
It really empowers a lot of our junior staff

404
00:19:49,758 --> 00:19:53,181
and makes sure that skill sets are allowed to shine,

405
00:19:53,181 --> 00:19:54,782
regardless of title.

406
00:19:55,423 --> 00:20:04,168
It also has a lot of our senior staff more invested in the growth and development of our junior employees because we share profit.

407
00:20:04,168 --> 00:20:09,031
The investment in that individual comes back and is an investment in the whole group.

408
00:20:09,031 --> 00:20:18,057
So there's a lot of investment all around, regardless of level of status where you fall in that vertical deployment.

409
00:20:19,068 --> 00:20:20,909
So we found these two things together, right?

410
00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:23,811
This horizontal structure and this vertical deployment

411
00:20:23,811 --> 00:20:26,593
creates a big culture of trust and accountability.

412
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:28,815
The question then becomes, how do you

413
00:20:28,815 --> 00:20:31,557
leverage that trust and accountability

414
00:20:31,557 --> 00:20:36,421
to make an even more inclusive and happy work environment?

415
00:20:36,421 --> 00:20:39,103
We do that in three main ways that I'll talk about briefly

416
00:20:39,103 --> 00:20:39,243
today.

417
00:20:39,243 --> 00:20:41,024
The first is education.

418
00:20:41,024 --> 00:20:43,546
The second is asking and acting.

419
00:20:43,546 --> 00:20:45,107
And the third is listen and implement.

420
00:20:46,467 --> 00:20:47,807
I'll start with education.

421
00:20:47,807 --> 00:20:50,288
So every Tuesday, we have an hour set aside

422
00:20:50,288 --> 00:20:52,229
where we do workshops, educational workshops.

423
00:20:52,229 --> 00:20:55,911
They cover a range of topics, some craft-based, some not.

424
00:20:55,911 --> 00:21:01,173
Also recently, the CEO of Wild Blue, Eli Allen and myself,

425
00:21:01,173 --> 00:21:02,814
ran all the members of our studio

426
00:21:02,814 --> 00:21:04,515
through a value creation workshop.

427
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:09,704
We're really interested in creating a bigger picture of how we create value in the marketplace,

428
00:21:09,704 --> 00:21:15,067
how we differentiate ourselves from competitors, and how we convey that value to our clients.

429
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:20,371
Some of you might be wondering what that has to do with our artists' ability to create good art.

430
00:21:22,146 --> 00:21:23,127
Nothing, right?

431
00:21:23,127 --> 00:21:26,049
Like the point wasn't to make our artists better

432
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:28,391
at creating art, it was to help them understand

433
00:21:28,391 --> 00:21:29,552
how the labor they're performing,

434
00:21:29,552 --> 00:21:32,854
how the art that they're creating creates value,

435
00:21:32,854 --> 00:21:35,276
how the processes that we use

436
00:21:35,276 --> 00:21:38,139
from tools and communication styles

437
00:21:38,139 --> 00:21:40,000
create some differentiation from our competitors,

438
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,861
and then how we leverage that differentiation,

439
00:21:41,861 --> 00:21:45,684
that value that they're creating and participating in,

440
00:21:45,684 --> 00:21:48,306
and use that to create good client relationships.

441
00:21:49,444 --> 00:21:52,127
We learned a lot in that workshop together,

442
00:21:52,127 --> 00:21:54,069
including that some of our most junior members

443
00:21:54,069 --> 00:21:55,870
have really good business ideas.

444
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:58,653
And it really helped us refine

445
00:21:58,653 --> 00:22:00,155
some of our internal strategies

446
00:22:00,155 --> 00:22:02,997
and also got a lot of internal alignment

447
00:22:02,997 --> 00:22:05,780
and buy-in in why we do the things the way that we do

448
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,042
and understand how we operate more broadly

449
00:22:08,042 --> 00:22:10,344
out of direct art-based tasks.

450
00:22:10,344 --> 00:22:13,027
So creating big pictures for your team members.

451
00:22:14,645 --> 00:22:16,765
Next, ask and then act.

452
00:22:16,765 --> 00:22:18,826
So, we recently conducted a survey

453
00:22:18,826 --> 00:22:20,786
where we just asked our team members,

454
00:22:20,786 --> 00:22:24,167
our employees, what do you need, sort of materially, right?

455
00:22:24,167 --> 00:22:25,947
These are some of the questions that were on our survey.

456
00:22:25,947 --> 00:22:27,868
But also, where do you want to go?

457
00:22:27,868 --> 00:22:29,148
What are your goals?

458
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:31,489
How do you want to get there?

459
00:22:31,489 --> 00:22:34,869
And I think at a lot of vertically structured studios

460
00:22:34,869 --> 00:22:38,030
or workplaces, you go and you sort of are given the menu

461
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,790
of the benefits that are available to you,

462
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:42,131
or there's a pre-established ladder that you climb

463
00:22:42,131 --> 00:22:44,251
and expectations for sort of how you're gonna get there.

464
00:22:44,852 --> 00:22:47,672
But going to your team and asking them, like, what do you need?

465
00:22:47,672 --> 00:22:53,354
And how can we help you meet those needs, both materially, but also, you know, professionally,

466
00:22:53,354 --> 00:22:55,655
and then helping them build that menu with you?

467
00:22:55,655 --> 00:23:01,436
You know, if your studio is predominantly artists or coders in their 20s or 30s, that

468
00:23:01,436 --> 00:23:04,137
menu is going to look different than if they're in their 40s and 50s.

469
00:23:04,137 --> 00:23:08,878
And sort of meeting your team where they're at is a good way to help build that positive

470
00:23:08,878 --> 00:23:09,258
culture.

471
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:12,082
So this was the asking.

472
00:23:12,082 --> 00:23:12,763
Here was our action.

473
00:23:12,763 --> 00:23:16,846
So this year, we reallocated our budget for marketing and

474
00:23:16,846 --> 00:23:18,226
web redevelopment.

475
00:23:18,226 --> 00:23:21,629
And we put that towards greater 401k contributions.

476
00:23:21,629 --> 00:23:24,591
And we are doing financial literacy training.

477
00:23:24,591 --> 00:23:26,812
We hired a financial advisor who's coming in.

478
00:23:26,812 --> 00:23:29,354
And during those Tuesday educational workshops, is

479
00:23:29,354 --> 00:23:32,256
running a series of three different workshops where we

480
00:23:32,256 --> 00:23:35,098
teach our employees on company time about

481
00:23:36,138 --> 00:23:41,019
budgeting, about retirement planning, about investing.

482
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:43,440
We also reassigned some project leadership tasks,

483
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,940
allowing some of our more junior members

484
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,200
to take greater leadership roles

485
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,041
so that they can expand and meet some of those career goals

486
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:50,901
that they identified in those surveys.

487
00:23:50,901 --> 00:23:52,242
We also scaled back a little bit

488
00:23:52,242 --> 00:23:53,482
some of those responsibilities

489
00:23:53,482 --> 00:23:55,923
for some of our more senior or mid-level artists

490
00:23:55,923 --> 00:23:58,923
who had been taking on more than was really appropriate

491
00:23:58,923 --> 00:24:00,204
for their particular title

492
00:24:00,204 --> 00:24:02,144
or didn't really align with their career goals.

493
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:06,888
Also, you can't just ask what's wrong.

494
00:24:06,888 --> 00:24:09,210
Sometimes you have to listen and find solutions

495
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:10,751
that your team doesn't even know are possible

496
00:24:10,751 --> 00:24:11,492
for you to provide.

497
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:14,874
One example is after the start of the pandemic,

498
00:24:14,874 --> 00:24:16,856
we started noticing a lot of people were complaining

499
00:24:16,856 --> 00:24:20,919
about more wrist pain, more back pain,

500
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:22,300
neck pain, elbow pain.

501
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,821
And this isn't that surprising.

502
00:24:23,821 --> 00:24:27,084
I'm sure we all spent a lot more time in front of the screen,

503
00:24:27,084 --> 00:24:29,706
didn't have the same sort of breaks or movements

504
00:24:29,706 --> 00:24:30,826
that we did pre-pandemic.

505
00:24:31,477 --> 00:24:37,943
So our solution proactively for this was to order a kit of different exercise equipment,

506
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:42,586
sent it to all of our studio members, and we hired a chiropractor who on Zoom taught

507
00:24:42,586 --> 00:24:47,991
us a different series of stretches and exercises that you can do to help with repetitive stress

508
00:24:47,991 --> 00:24:49,052
injuries.

509
00:24:49,052 --> 00:24:53,475
Now every day after our daily stand-up meeting we do 10 minutes of stretching, camera's off,

510
00:24:53,475 --> 00:24:57,438
but it's a time where we can all come together and invest in one another's health and really

511
00:24:57,438 --> 00:24:59,680
make sure that we're creating that culture of care in our company.

512
00:25:00,911 --> 00:25:04,233
Now, I've talked about listening and implementing,

513
00:25:04,233 --> 00:25:06,375
acting, I've talked about education,

514
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:10,098
but all of this is really built on that foundation

515
00:25:10,098 --> 00:25:11,338
of that trust and accountability.

516
00:25:11,338 --> 00:25:13,520
And I know the way that we have done that

517
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,922
isn't necessarily scalable or replicable for all of you.

518
00:25:15,922 --> 00:25:19,524
You can't go back and make all of your employees also owners

519
00:25:19,524 --> 00:25:22,006
but you can go back and interrogate how your systems

520
00:25:22,006 --> 00:25:24,908
and structures of power are built

521
00:25:24,908 --> 00:25:27,850
and whether or not there's accountability that can be.

522
00:25:28,191 --> 00:25:29,814
provided to your workers.

523
00:25:29,814 --> 00:25:35,826
And then you can retool that and create those opportunities

524
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:36,568
to listen, to act, and to educate.

525
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:38,932
And always empower your workers.

526
00:25:38,932 --> 00:25:39,353
Thank you.

527
00:25:57,749 --> 00:26:10,838
All right. Hi, everyone. My name is Irene Scholdt-Hadevosian. I'm the attorney of the group, so naturally my slides are going to have more words on it, but you're not expected to read any of them.

528
00:26:10,838 --> 00:26:13,280
They're just for me to present and for viewing.

529
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:18,544
So I'm going to talk about bettering workplace culture in the gaming industry.

530
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:24,848
And I've used what's going to be the outdated version of the saying, happy wife, happy life to create a more

531
00:26:25,832 --> 00:26:30,297
2021-2022 version of happy employee, happy company,

532
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,778
productive business.

533
00:26:31,778 --> 00:26:38,385
So why should you listen to what I have to say?

534
00:26:38,385 --> 00:26:40,888
So I'm a labor and employment attorney.

535
00:26:40,888 --> 00:26:45,633
I literally advise on the issues that we're all talking about.

536
00:26:45,633 --> 00:26:46,234
So

537
00:26:47,189 --> 00:27:04,820
I advise companies anywhere from small gaming studios to large publishers about how to implement certain policies and practices or consulting with how to create different structures that really better the workplace, both in the legal concept and in the practical concept.

538
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:11,164
So this is what I do. I also litigate issues that arise in the workplace.

539
00:27:11,164 --> 00:27:15,767
So I'll be using some examples as we go through this to discuss how this plays out.

540
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,211
Many different companies we've dealt with.

541
00:27:18,211 --> 00:27:23,393
Okay, why is a positive workplace culture important?

542
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:26,054
Well, one, you should want your employees to be happy,

543
00:27:26,054 --> 00:27:29,495
right, that end in and of itself should be enough.

544
00:27:29,495 --> 00:27:30,896
But let's say it's not enough.

545
00:27:30,896 --> 00:27:32,256
You're the executive of a company,

546
00:27:32,256 --> 00:27:34,117
you're focused on your financials.

547
00:27:34,117 --> 00:27:38,239
Well, let's talk about how having happy employees

548
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:41,460
gets you to that end, and not having employees

549
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,261
actually disrupts that end of having the numbers

550
00:27:44,261 --> 00:27:45,341
you need for your business.

551
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:48,486
So one, productivity.

552
00:27:48,486 --> 00:27:52,128
At the very end, I will show you some data that shows

553
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,609
when your employees are not happy,

554
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:59,053
your business is actually suffering, quantitatively.

555
00:27:59,053 --> 00:28:01,755
Two, it's a compliance issue, okay?

556
00:28:01,755 --> 00:28:05,957
If your workforce is unhappy for various reasons,

557
00:28:05,957 --> 00:28:09,340
and let's say they're legal, it's actionable,

558
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,340
it's legally actionable.

559
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,610
It's a compliance issue.

560
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,351
I mean, you all have seen the headlines, right?

561
00:28:13,351 --> 00:28:15,391
I mean, at this point, the U.S. government

562
00:28:15,391 --> 00:28:18,092
and state agencies are getting involved

563
00:28:18,092 --> 00:28:20,992
in litigating this dispute because they see a problem

564
00:28:20,992 --> 00:28:22,572
in the gaming industry.

565
00:28:22,572 --> 00:28:25,313
And if anyone here thinks there's not a problem, well,

566
00:28:25,313 --> 00:28:27,253
I'm here to tell you as an attorney,

567
00:28:27,253 --> 00:28:30,874
there is definitely a problem.

568
00:28:30,874 --> 00:28:33,534
Three, if you're a public company or if you're not,

569
00:28:33,534 --> 00:28:36,095
you wanna eventually sell your company,

570
00:28:36,095 --> 00:28:38,255
it's an investor and shareholder issue.

571
00:28:38,973 --> 00:28:43,216
If you want to eventually sell your company, the first thing that's going to get looked at are, you know,

572
00:28:43,216 --> 00:28:45,457
you're going to have the due diligence done.

573
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:48,279
Part of that due diligence is the employment practices, right?

574
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:50,340
So they're going to look into that.

575
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:55,044
And how much is what is wrong with the company is going to affect that final number

576
00:28:55,044 --> 00:28:57,245
of what you're selling your business for.

577
00:28:57,245 --> 00:29:01,768
Number four, doesn't need to be said at this point, it's a PR issue.

578
00:29:01,768 --> 00:29:05,971
It's a PR nightmare, potentially depending on how noncompliant the company is.

579
00:29:06,708 --> 00:29:10,090
Five, it's an employee retention issue.

580
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:12,971
If your workers are so unhappy that you have a high turnover

581
00:29:12,971 --> 00:29:15,733
rate, if you don't realize the amount of money

582
00:29:15,733 --> 00:29:20,615
you need to spend to retrain and rebring on and hire employees,

583
00:29:20,615 --> 00:29:23,737
I mean, that cost in and of itself is huge.

584
00:29:23,737 --> 00:29:26,258
Six, talent acquisition issue.

585
00:29:26,258 --> 00:29:29,780
If you have really great talent that you want to hire,

586
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:32,001
why would they come to a studio that

587
00:29:32,001 --> 00:29:35,323
has a reputation for being awful in its practices?

588
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:36,980
when they can go to another one

589
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,901
that has a positive reputation, right?

590
00:29:39,901 --> 00:29:42,803
Number seven, unionization.

591
00:29:42,803 --> 00:29:45,284
Full disclosure, I'm an employer-side attorney,

592
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:48,266
so unionization, we don't like it, right?

593
00:29:48,266 --> 00:29:51,208
My job is to make sure my clients' workplaces

594
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:52,468
are not unionized.

595
00:29:52,468 --> 00:29:54,189
It could be a positive thing,

596
00:29:54,189 --> 00:29:55,470
but here's why I bring it up,

597
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,392
because it's a huge cost for employers

598
00:29:58,392 --> 00:30:00,913
to run things through a union.

599
00:30:00,913 --> 00:30:02,094
If you are doing things right,

600
00:30:02,094 --> 00:30:03,895
you shouldn't need a third party.

601
00:30:04,546 --> 00:30:06,687
to engage with your employees.

602
00:30:06,687 --> 00:30:08,228
Having to go through a third party

603
00:30:08,228 --> 00:30:10,609
just raises business costs.

604
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:12,089
Unionization is being talked a lot

605
00:30:12,089 --> 00:30:13,750
about in the gaming community

606
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:18,652
because clearly there are problems.

607
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:22,134
Okay, so we've heard from all of our speakers

608
00:30:22,134 --> 00:30:24,915
about you can have all the paper that you want,

609
00:30:24,915 --> 00:30:26,155
but at the end of the day,

610
00:30:26,155 --> 00:30:28,777
if you're not practicing it in real life, it means nothing.

611
00:30:29,949 --> 00:30:32,871
So let's talk, like let's think of this as a house

612
00:30:32,871 --> 00:30:34,171
and let's talk about the foundation

613
00:30:34,171 --> 00:30:36,773
because the paperwork is important,

614
00:30:36,773 --> 00:30:41,035
but it doesn't trump the actual practice, right?

615
00:30:41,035 --> 00:30:44,957
So what are the type of things you should have in place

616
00:30:44,957 --> 00:30:47,018
to ensure you get to the next level

617
00:30:47,018 --> 00:30:48,259
of having the good house?

618
00:30:48,259 --> 00:30:52,141
So the foundation, policies, anti-discrimination,

619
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:55,763
anti-bullying, anti-harassment, anti-retaliation,

620
00:30:55,763 --> 00:30:58,344
consider having an open door policy.

621
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,502
examples of what's something every company should have.

622
00:31:04,502 --> 00:31:07,423
An actual reporting procedure, right?

623
00:31:07,423 --> 00:31:11,704
Reporting issues to your supervisors and managers.

624
00:31:11,704 --> 00:31:13,745
Highly recommend an anonymous hotline

625
00:31:13,745 --> 00:31:16,506
for companies that are able to implement it

626
00:31:16,506 --> 00:31:19,327
because sometimes the employee doesn't want,

627
00:31:19,327 --> 00:31:22,748
like is afraid that no matter how good of a workplace

628
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:25,669
that there is, that them being identified

629
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:27,910
as the complainant will result in certain things.

630
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:34,332
Having an HR team, if the company is, again, large enough for people to report to,

631
00:31:34,332 --> 00:31:38,254
and some very large companies have their own investigations team

632
00:31:38,254 --> 00:31:42,095
that reports can be sent directly to, internal investigation team.

633
00:31:42,095 --> 00:31:44,857
You have to have also an investigation procedure.

634
00:31:44,857 --> 00:31:50,199
If you're a smaller company, you refer that out externally for a neutral third party.

635
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:55,902
If you're a large enough company, you could potentially have your HR or designated executive

636
00:31:55,902 --> 00:31:59,283
or designated investigation team run the actual investigation.

637
00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:03,106
and actually run the investigation, not a fake one.

638
00:32:03,106 --> 00:32:05,086
There's real investigations and there's

639
00:32:05,086 --> 00:32:07,787
ones that are just for show.

640
00:32:07,787 --> 00:32:09,767
Diversity, equity, and inclusion.

641
00:32:09,767 --> 00:32:12,047
I mean, I can do a whole presentation on this.

642
00:32:12,047 --> 00:32:13,628
It is so important.

643
00:32:13,628 --> 00:32:16,928
I'll get into some of the statistics at the end.

644
00:32:16,928 --> 00:32:18,949
But what I'd recommend everyone here do

645
00:32:18,949 --> 00:32:23,129
is go look at the Microsoft report on diversity, equity,

646
00:32:23,129 --> 00:32:24,310
inclusion, the most recent one.

647
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:28,170
Because if you want a good standard for.

648
00:32:29,071 --> 00:32:31,372
the possibilities that exist in this workplace

649
00:32:31,372 --> 00:32:32,492
and how you can implement things

650
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,573
to make sure you have a diverse workforce,

651
00:32:34,573 --> 00:32:35,773
their report is pretty excellent.

652
00:32:35,773 --> 00:32:38,995
And in terms of the one thing I'll mention,

653
00:32:38,995 --> 00:32:41,396
for example, job descriptions.

654
00:32:41,396 --> 00:32:44,537
Who would have thought that job descriptions

655
00:32:44,537 --> 00:32:46,418
could change who's applying to your job?

656
00:32:46,418 --> 00:32:49,559
That has been proven to be fact

657
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:51,920
that if you put certain things in your job description,

658
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,521
you are not likely to get diverse candidates, right?

659
00:32:54,521 --> 00:32:55,901
Like women, for example.

660
00:32:55,901 --> 00:32:58,162
So that could be a major player.

661
00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:01,680
Okay, this is the structure.

662
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,780
So you built the foundation,

663
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,321
you have all the necessary paperwork.

664
00:33:05,321 --> 00:33:06,901
Now the structure.

665
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:09,882
Do you actually have a pulse on your people?

666
00:33:09,882 --> 00:33:13,223
Do you know what your employees are feeling like?

667
00:33:13,223 --> 00:33:15,624
So if you're a smaller company,

668
00:33:15,624 --> 00:33:17,744
what you would do is check in with your people directly.

669
00:33:17,744 --> 00:33:21,486
Every now and then, whether it's every month, quarter,

670
00:33:21,486 --> 00:33:23,426
if your employees are generally happy,

671
00:33:23,426 --> 00:33:25,827
and you know that, you can do it less often,

672
00:33:25,827 --> 00:33:28,448
or even then you can do it more often.

673
00:33:29,122 --> 00:33:40,188
Surveys, for large companies I highly recommend anonymous surveys because they're very, very helpful in telling you where problems might be.

674
00:33:40,188 --> 00:33:48,293
And you might have a part of the company population that feels really great and a part that's not doing so well, and you might want to look into why is that.

675
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:54,356
Committees, local, regional, national, global, a good example of this.

676
00:33:54,356 --> 00:33:57,238
And the committees have to include people from various job backgrounds.

677
00:33:57,873 --> 00:34:07,919
titles, right? So you are actually getting what the entire population is feeling. This is actually something I recommended for one of our international companies

678
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,481
because they were hearing different things from different

679
00:34:11,481 --> 00:34:17,445
countries in terms of how their employees were feeling. And so they actually implemented a global

680
00:34:17,445 --> 00:34:23,368
committee with people from various different job titles and actually then got to know

681
00:34:23,368 --> 00:34:26,970
better what's going on across different titles.

682
00:34:27,408 --> 00:34:30,270
and also across their whole universe.

683
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:32,332
So that actually worked out really well for them.

684
00:34:32,332 --> 00:34:32,672
Town halls.

685
00:34:32,672 --> 00:34:35,515
This is especially good for employees

686
00:34:35,515 --> 00:34:37,636
who want to hear from their executives, right?

687
00:34:37,636 --> 00:34:40,379
We've talked about, you know, be transparent.

688
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:42,400
Well, let your employees know what's going on

689
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,702
no matter how big or small.

690
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:57,630
When your employees feel like they're being communicated to as a last resort, right, you're just telling them what's happening rather than engaging with them and even listening to them about what's happening and taking their feedback and implementing it,

691
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:01,892
that makes them feel different versus, oh, and we're doing this now and you just have to accept it.

692
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:10,357
Dedicated chief people officer or, you know, having a great HR department can change a lot.

693
00:35:10,357 --> 00:35:15,500
And again, the whole point of this is employees want to know at the end of the day that their voice matters.

694
00:35:16,919 --> 00:35:20,024
All right, and I think this is the point of,

695
00:35:20,024 --> 00:35:21,406
everyone here has talked about this, right?

696
00:35:21,406 --> 00:35:23,829
You can build this great foundation,

697
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:25,892
you can build this great structure,

698
00:35:25,892 --> 00:35:26,814
but at the end of the day,

699
00:35:26,814 --> 00:35:29,297
if your house just has the foundation and the walls,

700
00:35:29,297 --> 00:35:31,561
and not the interior to make it feel homey and cozy,

701
00:35:31,561 --> 00:35:32,162
you have nothing.

702
00:35:33,018 --> 00:35:38,680
I had a big publisher contact us recently to set up all the, you know, better their structure.

703
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:42,742
And the first thing I said to them is, we're happy to do that for you,

704
00:35:42,742 --> 00:35:46,884
but the first thing I want you to do is go talk to your executives and ask them,

705
00:35:46,884 --> 00:35:50,105
are they willing to do the things we will recommend?

706
00:35:50,105 --> 00:35:55,347
Because if they're not, then I've just given you a whole bunch of paper, right?

707
00:35:55,347 --> 00:36:00,490
So every company, if you want to do this, hire, you know, whether it's a consultant or a law firm.

708
00:36:01,638 --> 00:36:05,499
Yeah, do it, but you have to be willing to go from A to Z,

709
00:36:05,499 --> 00:36:08,240
not just have the paperwork.

710
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,460
OK, productivity data.

711
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:13,262
I mean, the data is astounding, right?

712
00:36:13,262 --> 00:36:15,923
So in a poll of 1,000 US employees,

713
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:18,823
64% of workers said the employee experience impacts

714
00:36:18,823 --> 00:36:21,584
their ability to serve customers.

715
00:36:21,584 --> 00:36:27,766
In a Gallup poll, 80% are not engaged or actively disengaged

716
00:36:27,766 --> 00:36:28,147
at work.

717
00:36:29,003 --> 00:36:34,326
The lack of engagement cost the global economy $8.1 trillion.

718
00:36:34,326 --> 00:36:36,368
I mean, that's crazy.

719
00:36:36,368 --> 00:36:40,610
Nearly 10% of GDP in lost productivity each year.

720
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:43,993
Another important one on a poll recently

721
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:48,115
done by some universities really showing how lack of diversity

722
00:36:48,115 --> 00:36:51,758
affects companies, a 1% increase in racial diversity.

723
00:36:53,157 --> 00:37:00,799
Similarity between upper and lower management increases firm productivity by between $729 to $1,590 per employee per year.

724
00:37:00,799 --> 00:37:09,240
Lastly, I'll leave you with some demographic data that's honestly a little bit depressing.

725
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:17,842
And one of them includes the GDC report from this year. If you haven't read it, I encourage you to look at it.

726
00:37:17,842 --> 00:37:22,423
So that one said 73% identified as male in the video game industry, right?

727
00:37:22,854 --> 00:37:29,956
Activision Blizzard, after their accusations, released a report saying 24% of their total workforce is women,

728
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:37,699
whereas in the corporate world, it's 47%. Right? Why the disparity? There's the data shows that there's something wrong.

729
00:37:37,699 --> 00:37:40,180
And then another survey

730
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,521
indicated that there's, you know, people,

731
00:37:42,521 --> 00:37:48,763
74% of people feel that there's not equal treatment or opportunity in the gaming industry, and that statistic has worsened over time.

732
00:37:52,499 --> 00:37:53,740
So I know I'm ending with the depressing part,

733
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,102
but that is all a call to action to all of you,

734
00:37:56,102 --> 00:37:58,344
because each of you has a role in this, to change it, right?

735
00:37:58,344 --> 00:37:59,745
And you got to lay the foundation,

736
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:01,186
you have to have the structure,

737
00:38:01,186 --> 00:38:03,168
but you got to put the interior in there

738
00:38:03,168 --> 00:38:04,529
and be willing to put it to work.

739
00:38:04,529 --> 00:38:05,170
Thank you.

740
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:05,770
Thank you.

741
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:06,271
Thank you.

742
00:38:06,271 --> 00:38:06,471
Thank you.

743
00:38:06,471 --> 00:38:06,891
Thank you.

744
00:38:06,891 --> 00:38:07,311
Thank you.

745
00:38:07,311 --> 00:38:07,592
Thank you.

746
00:38:07,592 --> 00:38:08,032
Thank you.

747
00:38:08,032 --> 00:38:08,412
Thank you.

748
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:08,713
Thank you.

749
00:38:08,713 --> 00:38:09,533
Thank you.

750
00:38:09,533 --> 00:38:09,974
Thank you.

751
00:38:09,974 --> 00:38:10,154
Thank you.

752
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:10,394
Thank you.

753
00:38:10,394 --> 00:38:10,694
Thank you.

754
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:24,173
Because we were so wonderful, you have to fill out your evaluations.

755
00:38:24,173 --> 00:38:29,196
So, should I read the whole thing again?

756
00:38:29,196 --> 00:38:30,456
Do you guys know where they are?

757
00:38:30,456 --> 00:38:33,818
Okay, you'll find them. Okay, thank you.

758
00:38:33,818 --> 00:38:37,620
Yes, yes, we're going to do a...

759
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:40,441
We're happy to take Q&A.

760
00:38:40,441 --> 00:38:43,303
Just if you line up behind the mics, we'll switch back and forth.

761
00:38:44,624 --> 00:38:49,488
Hi, I've been to two different companies that have had,

762
00:38:49,488 --> 00:38:53,631
well, I guess technically three companies

763
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:55,993
who've had like town hall meetings,

764
00:38:55,993 --> 00:38:56,694
town hall style meetings,

765
00:38:56,694 --> 00:38:58,536
and I found them generally to be kind of disappointing.

766
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:04,160
Can you give some examples of what you see to be effective

767
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,582
or like well-structured,

768
00:39:06,582 --> 00:39:12,107
what the must-haves are for a good town hall style meeting?

769
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:15,712
That's a good question.

770
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:20,957
So I would say the bad ones are where people are talking at you, right?

771
00:39:20,957 --> 00:39:24,721
And the good ones are where there's a conversation.

772
00:39:24,721 --> 00:39:28,065
If a company is big enough to have the tech to be able to do it,

773
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:34,031
you could have people simultaneously polling via their phones or some other tech, right?

774
00:39:34,853 --> 00:39:38,075
live as it's happening so the feedback is coming in,

775
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:40,556
but you could also just have it be a conversation, right?

776
00:39:40,556 --> 00:39:42,617
Like let people speak to a certain extent.

777
00:39:42,617 --> 00:39:44,799
You might not be able to get to everyone,

778
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,960
but a good town hall is not just communicating information

779
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,841
but taking feedback.

780
00:39:49,841 --> 00:39:51,622
So if you're doing a town hall

781
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:53,903
where you're just communicating information as an employer,

782
00:39:53,903 --> 00:39:57,505
that's not a town hall, that's just a meeting, right?

783
00:39:57,505 --> 00:40:00,507
So at a very high level,

784
00:40:00,507 --> 00:40:01,727
that's the most, I think, important thing.

785
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:07,711
I would also add that what I've seen most in town halls is that when they scale, they

786
00:40:07,711 --> 00:40:08,751
can often scale poorly.

787
00:40:08,751 --> 00:40:14,613
And so often what you'll run into is as town halls scale, the authenticity of both questions

788
00:40:14,613 --> 00:40:15,453
and answers drop.

789
00:40:15,453 --> 00:40:21,015
What I would suggest there is one, just be aware of that problem and be thinking about

790
00:40:21,015 --> 00:40:21,235
it.

791
00:40:21,235 --> 00:40:21,835
Two, a lot of it is...

792
00:40:22,855 --> 00:40:26,820
on the folks who you send out to do the leadership side of the town hall.

793
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:32,907
Reinforce the authenticity of answers. Don't pre-prepare answers. Don't treat it as a

794
00:40:32,907 --> 00:40:37,973
quotey fingers rude Q&A, but instead really try to bring their whole selves and be present and

795
00:40:37,973 --> 00:40:39,895
listening to the questions and don't try to.

796
00:40:40,095 --> 00:40:43,718
change the questions and the questions they want to answer.

797
00:40:43,718 --> 00:40:47,340
And then third, just be ready to split up town halls when the scale gets too big

798
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,662
and be really transparent about why you're doing that.

799
00:40:49,662 --> 00:40:53,484
Don't don't hide town halls or make it feel like people

800
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:56,206
can't see all of the town halls that happen.

801
00:40:56,206 --> 00:41:00,089
But from an interaction standpoint, scale it wider

802
00:41:00,089 --> 00:41:01,510
so that it feels more authentic.

803
00:41:05,567 --> 00:41:10,131
Hi, so this one is mostly sort of directed at Christopher.

804
00:41:10,131 --> 00:41:11,612
Thank you for your presentation.

805
00:41:11,612 --> 00:41:13,294
You mentioned trust and accountability

806
00:41:13,294 --> 00:41:17,477
as a big part of what you do in your studio

807
00:41:17,477 --> 00:41:19,379
to make the horizontal structure work.

808
00:41:19,379 --> 00:41:22,201
I come from like mutual aid organizing

809
00:41:22,201 --> 00:41:25,985
and other sorts of non-work organizing work

810
00:41:25,985 --> 00:41:27,246
where a lot of things are horizontal

811
00:41:27,246 --> 00:41:30,328
and trust and accountability is something I feel like

812
00:41:30,328 --> 00:41:32,370
I've struggled even when there's no money involved,

813
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:34,011
no employment involved.

814
00:41:34,372 --> 00:41:40,444
nothing of that sort. I was wondering if you had any stories of successes

815
00:41:40,444 --> 00:41:43,490
in someone being accountable for something that they have done.

816
00:41:45,672 --> 00:41:54,277
First I'll say I think it's almost harder when there's not money and it's all volunteer-based

817
00:41:54,277 --> 00:41:59,580
because it's easier to sort of opt out of those engagements than it is if it's your

818
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,061
job.

819
00:42:01,061 --> 00:42:11,427
But an example of success of holding someone accountable, let's see, I'm trying to think

820
00:42:11,427 --> 00:42:13,068
of one that I can share.

821
00:42:15,675 --> 00:42:26,738
Yeah, I'll say that we had, let's say, a new client project that we were starting and there

822
00:42:26,738 --> 00:42:29,959
were some sort of communication pitfalls along the way.

823
00:42:29,959 --> 00:42:34,700
Some things were sort of dropped and at the end of the day we had to, you know, get it

824
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:39,444
gather around the wagons and like hold people accountable and point out like where we had

825
00:42:39,444 --> 00:42:44,769
sort of evaluate where we had, you know, fallen a little short in building up that, especially

826
00:42:44,769 --> 00:42:49,833
a new relationship. I think new relationships always require more energy as you're building

827
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:53,496
that. And I think one of the things that we do is, you know, always

828
00:42:54,537 --> 00:42:59,561
approach that accountability not as like a trial, right, but as an opportunity to do

829
00:42:59,561 --> 00:43:00,902
better the next time.

830
00:43:00,902 --> 00:43:03,004
So it wasn't like yelling, you did this.

831
00:43:03,004 --> 00:43:06,606
It was like, hey, here are some problems where we think this went wrong.

832
00:43:06,606 --> 00:43:09,088
Here's how we can do better the next time.

833
00:43:09,088 --> 00:43:14,092
And you know, you always give that person, you got to give that next time, though, right?

834
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:14,832
But it also helped us.

835
00:43:15,433 --> 00:43:18,794
even retool the way that we approach current client relationships.

836
00:43:18,794 --> 00:43:23,195
And so we became like an educational moment, not just in how we onboard new clients,

837
00:43:23,195 --> 00:43:26,556
but making sure that we give even better experiences to our existing ones.

838
00:43:26,556 --> 00:43:31,417
And it's because we're able to have those open conversations and hold one another accountable.

839
00:43:31,417 --> 00:43:35,118
But that accountability doesn't look like punishment, and I think that that's really important.

840
00:43:39,248 --> 00:43:44,370
Hi, my question is about the vertical horizontal system,

841
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:48,152
especially when a team is growing or trying to scale up.

842
00:43:48,152 --> 00:43:53,974
What kind of issues would you foresee needing to tackle

843
00:43:53,974 --> 00:43:56,515
or how would you prepare yourself and your team

844
00:43:56,515 --> 00:43:59,456
to face any issues that do arise

845
00:43:59,456 --> 00:44:01,237
if the team is growing really fast

846
00:44:01,237 --> 00:44:03,538
while trying to maintain that sort of structure

847
00:44:03,538 --> 00:44:04,618
and trust and accountability?

848
00:44:05,697 --> 00:44:14,666
I think that's a great question. We last year hired four new people, so we went from a team of six to a team of ten as kind of core members.

849
00:44:14,666 --> 00:44:25,738
And, you know, when you have suddenly 40% of your studio is new and doesn't know what the culture is or what it looks like, or a lot of the sort of casual conversations you've been having with each other.

850
00:44:26,278 --> 00:44:29,721
Suddenly you need to teach other people those conversations.

851
00:44:29,721 --> 00:44:34,424
So I think good documentation helps here to be able to point them to that.

852
00:44:34,424 --> 00:44:39,228
But this gets to, I think, everything, a kind of common thread that we've been saying throughout today is

853
00:44:39,228 --> 00:44:43,051
that documentation is great, but it's more about what you do, like Carl was saying,

854
00:44:43,051 --> 00:44:47,114
or how you demonstrate empathy, like Yuseni was saying, or building that foundation,

855
00:44:47,114 --> 00:44:50,356
but actually filling it with things, like Irene was saying.

856
00:44:50,356 --> 00:44:52,138
So all those things are important to have in place.

857
00:44:52,138 --> 00:44:54,840
But as you scale, especially making sure that you have systems in place

858
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:55,600
that allow you to...

859
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:01,402
onboard those new team members and know that the onboarding takes time and giving, making sure

860
00:45:01,402 --> 00:45:06,164
that you're building in, particularly if you have process or pipeline things and deadlines that,

861
00:45:06,164 --> 00:45:10,005
you know, you're going to need time to build culture just as much as you need time to build assets.

862
00:45:10,005 --> 00:45:18,908
Uh, first, I really just wanted to thank all of you for sharing your, um, experience and

863
00:45:18,908 --> 00:45:23,730
your perspective on this really important topic. Um, sorry, I get emotional. I just think it's

864
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:25,430
really important for us to.

865
00:45:27,127 --> 00:45:33,388
have this conversation so that we can all work together to build an industry we're all super proud of.

866
00:45:33,388 --> 00:45:34,628
So, thanks.

867
00:45:34,628 --> 00:45:47,530
Second of all, I was curious if you all had any more thoughts about or suggestions about how to build a strong culture with a distributed team, right, where everyone's not all in the same room.

868
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:49,210
Thanks.

869
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:51,691
I'm glad you asked.

870
00:45:51,691 --> 00:45:56,191
So I'll talk a little bit about Brass Lion Entertainment.

871
00:45:57,528 --> 00:46:02,992
I feel like we have a really strong studio culture and it's something really precious

872
00:46:02,992 --> 00:46:09,636
to me because as we continue to grow our team, that's something that we constantly look at

873
00:46:09,636 --> 00:46:10,817
in terms of who we bring in.

874
00:46:10,817 --> 00:46:17,742
And so some things that we do, as I mentioned, we do scheduled coffee time where 30 minutes

875
00:46:17,742 --> 00:46:19,603
every Monday we talk to each other.

876
00:46:19,603 --> 00:46:20,483
We also have...

877
00:46:21,251 --> 00:46:27,195
this thing, because I like naming conventions, but I have this thing that's called Film Fridays,

878
00:46:27,195 --> 00:46:30,358
Fun Fridays, and I also have Feeling Fridays.

879
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:35,962
So I kind of like put these in place to kind of help build that connection with everyone.

880
00:46:35,962 --> 00:46:40,905
And so we, every Friday we'll watch a movie together on, you know, over Zoom.

881
00:46:41,352 --> 00:46:44,254
or we'll play a game together, or we'll actually talk,

882
00:46:44,254 --> 00:46:46,216
I call it feelings privacy, because this is where it allows

883
00:46:46,216 --> 00:46:48,758
us to have more transparent and more honest conversations

884
00:46:48,758 --> 00:46:51,400
with each other, based on like, hey, I read this article,

885
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,301
can we all talk about it as a group?

886
00:46:53,301 --> 00:46:57,084
And I think another thing that makes our studio so strong

887
00:46:57,084 --> 00:46:59,125
is the fact that we're so diverse,

888
00:46:59,125 --> 00:47:02,368
and we can have more honest conversations a lot faster

889
00:47:02,368 --> 00:47:04,009
than any other studio I've worked at,

890
00:47:04,009 --> 00:47:08,893
where there is no ego and there's no hard feelings,

891
00:47:08,893 --> 00:47:10,394
no one's feelings getting hurt.

892
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:10,654
And so.

893
00:47:11,545 --> 00:47:13,846
Because we make it a safe environment,

894
00:47:13,846 --> 00:47:15,746
we're all able to talk to each other.

895
00:47:15,746 --> 00:47:21,568
So I think pretty much it goes the way I build that culture

896
00:47:21,568 --> 00:47:24,289
is that having that empathy and production adds onto that,

897
00:47:24,289 --> 00:47:25,330
essentially.

898
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:27,551
So it's like making sure you're talking to your team members,

899
00:47:27,551 --> 00:47:30,972
making sure that you're interacting with them.

900
00:47:30,972 --> 00:47:34,153
That's not always work, getting to know your team members.

901
00:47:34,153 --> 00:47:37,955
And checking in on them is such a big deal,

902
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:40,095
just because it's like.

903
00:47:41,005 --> 00:47:45,526
Man, I really wish other people gave a shit about me when I first started 13 years ago,

904
00:47:45,526 --> 00:47:49,567
and that's like such a big thing now because that's what makes my team happy.

905
00:47:49,567 --> 00:47:53,648
It's that they feel seen, that they feel heard, and they're involved in the process, and I'm

906
00:47:53,648 --> 00:47:54,708
very transparent with them.

907
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:57,449
So that's what I do, at least from my side.

908
00:47:57,449 --> 00:48:01,850
I don't know if anyone else has something else to add.

909
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:06,631
Yeah, so while Blue's always been a fully remote team, there are 10 of us, but we operate

910
00:48:06,631 --> 00:48:07,991
out of seven different states.

911
00:48:09,323 --> 00:48:13,005
So, you know, we Discord is sort of our home base, right?

912
00:48:13,005 --> 00:48:14,986
Or Slack sometimes.

913
00:48:14,986 --> 00:48:17,027
But I think part of that is creating spaces

914
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:19,168
where you're doing like non-production things.

915
00:48:19,168 --> 00:48:22,370
So some of those, like we have our Education Tuesdays.

916
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:24,110
Every Wednesday we do a Twitch stream together

917
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,132
or we just offer free portfolio reviews

918
00:48:26,132 --> 00:48:28,273
for anyone who wants to swing by.

919
00:48:28,273 --> 00:48:30,254
We do things like that that just sort of help us

920
00:48:30,254 --> 00:48:31,414
be part of a broader community

921
00:48:31,414 --> 00:48:33,855
but also build community together.

922
00:48:33,855 --> 00:48:36,277
I think it's also really important to like plan fun

923
00:48:36,277 --> 00:48:38,478
because you don't have those moments when you come together.

924
00:48:38,838 --> 00:48:42,963
like at the water cooler, or the lunch table, or the, you know, so I've done things like

925
00:48:42,963 --> 00:48:47,729
ask everyone to send me their favorite pump-up song. I've made a Spotify playlist, send it out

926
00:48:47,729 --> 00:48:51,854
to everybody. Everyone listens to the playlist and tries to guess who's who, and then we send

927
00:48:51,854 --> 00:48:56,379
like a coffee to whoever. I really found familiar coffee. I don't know if you're familiar with it

928
00:48:56,379 --> 00:48:57,640
or not, but it's like a...

929
00:48:58,081 --> 00:49:01,084
they do like gaming art, support the board game community.

930
00:49:01,084 --> 00:49:02,745
And so we would just send a bag of that

931
00:49:02,745 --> 00:49:05,167
to whoever like gets the most right.

932
00:49:05,167 --> 00:49:06,488
And we'll do, I'll come up with like different

933
00:49:06,488 --> 00:49:07,529
sort of things like that all the time.

934
00:49:07,529 --> 00:49:09,311
And we just always send out coffee, you know,

935
00:49:09,311 --> 00:49:11,092
so like just ways to kind of create fun

936
00:49:11,092 --> 00:49:11,893
and have people engage,

937
00:49:11,893 --> 00:49:14,075
but also like learn more about one another.

938
00:49:14,075 --> 00:49:16,197
So it's sort of like a fact finding mission

939
00:49:16,197 --> 00:49:16,837
about one another.

940
00:49:16,837 --> 00:49:19,640
So you learn a little about what people's music tastes are

941
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:22,202
or what your favorite Halloween movie is,

942
00:49:22,202 --> 00:49:23,663
or, but then like that kind of guessing

943
00:49:23,663 --> 00:49:25,945
and having to ask and like evaluate.

944
00:49:26,426 --> 00:49:28,878
that has nothing to do with production

945
00:49:28,878 --> 00:49:31,129
and everything to do with building those relationships.

946
00:49:33,163 --> 00:49:37,225
Lots of things, but I think the most important thing right now, or one of the most important

947
00:49:37,225 --> 00:49:39,426
things is inclusion.

948
00:49:39,426 --> 00:49:43,367
Making sure you have a diverse and inclusive workforce.

949
00:49:43,367 --> 00:49:48,329
It's clearly a huge problem in the industry, and oftentimes you hear, oh, well, there are

950
00:49:48,329 --> 00:49:50,510
not enough female engineers or game developers.

951
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:54,052
Well, then solve the problem, right?

952
00:49:54,052 --> 00:49:57,053
A good example is USC, for example.

953
00:49:57,053 --> 00:50:01,635
I think in their recent class had more female game developers than male.

954
00:50:02,512 --> 00:50:04,733
And they've been really pushing for that.

955
00:50:04,733 --> 00:50:07,436
So there's one way of doing it.

956
00:50:07,436 --> 00:50:08,817
But if you make an effort to do it,

957
00:50:08,817 --> 00:50:12,900
I guarantee you can have an inclusive workforce.

958
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:15,262
Yeah, the only thing I'd add in addition

959
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:20,806
to sort of the recommendations that have come up, which

960
00:50:20,806 --> 00:50:21,787
I think come back to.

961
00:50:23,421 --> 00:50:26,365
We take for granted very often the social norms

962
00:50:26,365 --> 00:50:29,149
and the easy ways we have of doing things in person

963
00:50:29,149 --> 00:50:31,914
because we're so used to it, it's all habitual.

964
00:50:31,914 --> 00:50:35,018
And so making sure that you really think about

965
00:50:35,018 --> 00:50:37,322
and be present for what are you lacking

966
00:50:37,322 --> 00:50:38,904
in distributed environments and.

967
00:50:39,465 --> 00:50:45,668
you have to put the work into making those moments happen, whether it's, you know, calling

968
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:50,109
attention time for outside of work conversations, building and stretching time, that kind of stuff,

969
00:50:50,109 --> 00:50:54,411
finding those social moments where people can find belonging, find connection is super important.

970
00:50:54,912 --> 00:51:01,778
The other piece that I would do that I see a lot of companies and a lot of individuals miss is that

971
00:51:01,778 --> 00:51:07,282
really making it everyone's problem, really bringing everyone into the fold of that challenge.

972
00:51:07,282 --> 00:51:13,988
Everyone owns a piece of that, right? Like how I show up to work in an office is I contribute to

973
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:17,811
everyone else's happiness around me and it should be no different in a distributed environment.

974
00:51:18,232 --> 00:51:23,334
And so don't try to solve it just at a leadership layer or just at a production layer, right?

975
00:51:23,334 --> 00:51:26,836
Really bring that problem to every member of your team and be like,

976
00:51:26,836 --> 00:51:28,637
hey, how can we make this better?

977
00:51:28,637 --> 00:51:30,698
How can we better capture presence?

978
00:51:30,698 --> 00:51:32,699
How can we better capture belonging, right?

979
00:51:32,699 --> 00:51:34,539
Like, what are we missing?

980
00:51:34,539 --> 00:51:36,360
What gaps do you see?

981
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,282
And bring everyone into solving the problem.

982
00:51:39,282 --> 00:51:41,963
I also really like to roast my team in stand-up.

983
00:51:41,963 --> 00:51:43,784
That is all.

984
00:51:45,447 --> 00:51:49,609
Everyone appreciates a good reason. I think we're on that side.

985
00:51:49,609 --> 00:51:55,732
Yeah, I'm wondering what your thoughts are around some of the more systemic, pernicious,

986
00:51:55,732 --> 00:52:02,815
or leadership issues around culture, where folks who may not have positions of power,

987
00:52:02,815 --> 00:52:07,477
what sorts of things would you recommend or suggest to folks who

988
00:52:07,477 --> 00:52:11,459
really feel powerless to influence positive workplace culture?

989
00:52:13,942 --> 00:52:22,207
I mean, that is the hard answer that I would give you is you have a lot of power, right?

990
00:52:22,207 --> 00:52:27,111
If you feel powerless, you do have a lot of power, you should use your voice, and you

991
00:52:27,111 --> 00:52:30,914
should use your actions, and you should try to safeguard your behavior.

992
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:33,035
And I know that I recognize that.

993
00:52:34,334 --> 00:52:36,935
in late-stage capitalism, which we can all enjoy.

994
00:52:36,935 --> 00:52:38,716
It doesn't always feel like that,

995
00:52:38,716 --> 00:52:42,537
and there are real consequences to those actions.

996
00:52:42,537 --> 00:52:43,778
But at the end of the day,

997
00:52:43,778 --> 00:52:46,299
I think we find ourselves in a time where...

998
00:52:46,926 --> 00:52:52,907
The voice of every worker is more listened to than ever before, and you have a lot of

999
00:52:52,907 --> 00:52:53,427
power.

1000
00:52:53,427 --> 00:52:59,528
And if you find yourself in a leadership position or transitioning into a leadership position,

1001
00:52:59,528 --> 00:53:05,309
really holding that accountability on yourself to act in the way that we all aspire to have

1002
00:53:05,309 --> 00:53:10,770
the great game industry that we can all be super proud of, and holding that near and

1003
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:13,371
dear to your heart, and holding your fellow leaders accountable.

1004
00:53:13,371 --> 00:53:16,431
But if you feel powerless, I...

1005
00:53:17,253 --> 00:53:19,354
As someone who does a lot of recruiting in their life,

1006
00:53:19,354 --> 00:53:22,535
I can tell you that the job market will reward you deeply

1007
00:53:22,535 --> 00:53:24,416
for using your voice and using your action

1008
00:53:24,416 --> 00:53:25,497
to find a better studio.

1009
00:53:25,497 --> 00:53:28,138
And that is the most powerful way you can give a message

1010
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:29,178
to the leaders of your studio

1011
00:53:29,178 --> 00:53:30,518
that it's not acceptable anymore.

1012
00:53:36,252 --> 00:54:03,293
Hi. So I was wondering how you deal with the risks of changing kind of culture building tactics or techniques too quickly or too often. So the context here is to create that safety, that culture of safety. People don't want the rug constantly pulled from under them. And I wonder, yeah, how you approach that idea of you see something going wrong. How long do you kind of slowly change it versus being like, hey, not doing that anymore. Here's what we're doing now.

1013
00:54:05,705 --> 00:54:08,347
So your question is if something's going wrong,

1014
00:54:08,347 --> 00:54:10,689
like how do we go about changing it instead of like,

1015
00:54:10,689 --> 00:54:12,871
whether we do it fast or we do it slowly kind of?

1016
00:54:12,871 --> 00:54:15,553
Yeah, and I guess just mitigating the risk

1017
00:54:15,553 --> 00:54:16,875
of if you change things too much too often,

1018
00:54:16,875 --> 00:54:19,057
people will start to feel unstable.

1019
00:54:19,057 --> 00:54:21,699
So I can speak on the, from the production side of things

1020
00:54:21,699 --> 00:54:22,480
just because.

1021
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:23,841
We do this a lot.

1022
00:54:23,841 --> 00:54:27,404
We're constantly having to pivot, especially not just

1023
00:54:27,404 --> 00:54:31,328
with the project itself, but also in process as well.

1024
00:54:31,328 --> 00:54:33,750
As I mentioned earlier, everywhere I work at,

1025
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:36,312
there's no process that fits every studio.

1026
00:54:36,312 --> 00:54:38,354
And even within a studio, each team,

1027
00:54:38,354 --> 00:54:41,377
they all have the different processes.

1028
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:45,413
what I do with my production team and my art producers here, so I'm calling her out as well.

1029
00:54:45,413 --> 00:54:51,658
She's amazing at her job, so just giving kudos to her. But something that we really do is we

1030
00:54:51,658 --> 00:54:56,882
really listen to the team on the production side of like, okay, what's not working? We have

1031
00:54:56,882 --> 00:55:02,627
retrospectives after each sprint and we don't have it just to have retrospectives. We actually do

1032
00:55:02,627 --> 00:55:06,590
stuff about it because our team actually gives us feedback of like what didn't work and what did

1033
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:07,591
work. And so...

1034
00:55:08,823 --> 00:55:15,047
Usually what I do is take that feedback and I do it incremental changes, especially in process,

1035
00:55:15,047 --> 00:55:20,290
because when I'm doing, for example, if I'm in pre-production versus actual production,

1036
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:25,734
I change the formality of things. So I do it very incremental of like, okay, I'm going to change

1037
00:55:25,734 --> 00:55:31,017
this one little thing and then, okay, see how that works and then we're going to change it again.

1038
00:55:31,017 --> 00:55:35,079
So one concrete example I can give is we're all remote.

1039
00:55:35,652 --> 00:55:43,999
and we, our team size has grown, and as our team has grown, our sprint and our planning days have

1040
00:55:43,999 --> 00:55:51,245
gone really long, and so I can see as we were doing it, everyone's eyes was glossing over,

1041
00:55:51,245 --> 00:55:56,190
I'm like, okay, we need to change this, and everyone's feedback is like, it's getting too

1042
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:58,812
long, we have too many people, so instead of

1043
00:55:59,881 --> 00:56:04,046
changing everything all at once. I was like, okay, first off, let's just do this one little

1044
00:56:04,046 --> 00:56:08,331
thing and see how it goes. Let's break it up into segments and give everyone breaks and be like an

1045
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:12,616
hour or 30 minute breaks in between like planning sessions versus like review sessions and

1046
00:56:12,616 --> 00:56:16,380
retrospectives and et cetera. And so I did that. And so now I'm kind of,

1047
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:21,002
testing the reason why I bring it up is because I'm still testing the waters and so far the

1048
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:26,363
Schedule change that I did with the team was working really well. And so now I'm going to evaluate and like, okay

1049
00:56:26,363 --> 00:56:27,983
What other changes do we need to do?

1050
00:56:27,983 --> 00:56:32,885
So I I recommend going incremental and kind of like testing see how it goes out and then do it because if you do too

1051
00:56:32,885 --> 00:56:38,006
Many changes in my experience everyone's like oh my god, that's too much and then they're overwhelmed and then they like shut down

1052
00:56:38,006 --> 00:56:38,847
And you don't want that

1053
00:56:41,556 --> 00:56:44,721
I also think be transparent with your people.

1054
00:56:44,721 --> 00:56:47,585
And if you need to go through some trial and error

1055
00:56:47,585 --> 00:56:49,188
to get to the optimal result.

1056
00:56:49,595 --> 00:56:54,620
And if your employees know that out front, right, we're going to try this.

1057
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:58,864
Maybe it's awful and it doesn't work for our team and might work for some other

1058
00:56:58,864 --> 00:57:03,068
company. Okay. That didn't work, but let's try. And again, don't do it too quickly.

1059
00:57:03,068 --> 00:57:08,274
Right. Because people need to take a breath before you go to the next one.

1060
00:57:08,274 --> 00:57:12,298
If you implement it without talking to them, then most likely they're going to be

1061
00:57:12,298 --> 00:57:12,998
unhappy or.

1062
00:57:14,168 --> 00:57:15,809
Again, people don't like things happening to them.

1063
00:57:15,809 --> 00:57:17,871
They want to be involved, right?

1064
00:57:17,871 --> 00:57:20,573
When they're involved and they feel like they're part of the process, even if maybe

1065
00:57:20,573 --> 00:57:24,477
it's changing quickly, you'll probably have a better result than if you're changing it.

1066
00:57:24,477 --> 00:57:28,440
And everyone's just sitting back trying to hang on for, you know, their life.

1067
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:28,680
Yeah.

1068
00:57:30,789 --> 00:57:31,189
Thank you.

1069
00:57:31,189 --> 00:57:31,349
Yeah.

1070
00:57:31,349 --> 00:57:32,951
As for criticism too, right?

1071
00:57:32,951 --> 00:57:35,053
Like if you're gonna implement a new process,

1072
00:57:35,053 --> 00:57:36,775
tell them what that new process is

1073
00:57:36,775 --> 00:57:38,117
and find out who your biggest critic is

1074
00:57:38,117 --> 00:57:40,539
and get their like worst complaints about it

1075
00:57:40,539 --> 00:57:42,882
and try to actively solve those

1076
00:57:42,882 --> 00:57:45,044
before you roll out full implementation.

1077
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:46,105
We did this recently where we.

1078
00:57:46,566 --> 00:57:50,869
completely changed how we handle our review process and even the platform that it takes place in.

1079
00:57:50,869 --> 00:57:53,451
And our art director straight up told us he hated it and didn't want to do it.

1080
00:57:53,451 --> 00:57:57,014
Right? And we're like, tell me why? Break that down.

1081
00:57:57,014 --> 00:58:00,577
Like, unpack that hatred for me a little bit so I can understand it.

1082
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:03,840
And then, like, I can work to solve that and make you not hate it.

1083
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:07,363
And if you still hate it at the end of the day, we can go back to the way things were before.

1084
00:58:07,363 --> 00:58:09,024
But we have to do something that's different.

1085
00:58:09,024 --> 00:58:11,366
And, like, let's try this together rather than, like...

1086
00:58:11,767 --> 00:58:19,354
This is sort of that like, don't hand down that decision and like stamp it as the way it's going to be because you'll just meet much more resistance that way.

1087
00:58:19,354 --> 00:58:33,627
Yeah, the main thing I would add to that is, I think it's when you're being transparent, being transparent about the why and why you're making that decision as much as possible, bring people into the problem in that way. Right. And two,

1088
00:58:35,109 --> 00:58:51,643
gauge how reactive you're being. And the best way I found for me to deal with that is to do as much scenario planning up front of like, hey, how will I know it's going bad? Or how will I know I'm in in scenario A or B? And what would I do if I was there?

1089
00:58:52,043 --> 00:58:56,568
And that also helps you potentially bring more people into the problem of like making it more

1090
00:58:56,568 --> 00:59:00,092
transparent about why reactions are happening. And if you find yourself in a place where

1091
00:59:00,092 --> 00:59:05,638
you've changed a couple times and you haven't fight the right answer, exposing the next set

1092
00:59:05,638 --> 00:59:10,864
of scenarios can help people understand like, ah, there's a plan. We're not just being reactive.

1093
00:59:10,864 --> 00:59:12,426
And I find that that

1094
00:59:12,762 --> 00:59:18,968
idea that like, hey, it's not just reacting to the moment, but being thoughtful about

1095
00:59:18,968 --> 00:59:23,552
the whole situation and then being brought into the problem can help increase the amount

1096
00:59:23,552 --> 00:59:27,396
of change that people can onboard at a time.

1097
00:59:27,396 --> 00:59:31,820
But you always have to like temperature check that with the humans involved.

1098
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:36,584
And you know, the only thing I would say in your specific wording of your question is

1099
00:59:37,385 --> 00:59:39,168
If it's a severe problem, don't wait.

1100
00:59:39,168 --> 00:59:45,398
It's better to deal with the problems of fast change management than really severe problems.

1101
00:59:45,398 --> 00:59:47,983
And just always gauge that.

1102
00:59:47,983 --> 00:59:48,985
Great. Thank you very much.

1103
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:55,763
Cool. You guys are rock stars. Thank you. This is awesome.

1104
00:59:55,763 --> 00:59:58,825
The previous answers I maybe are going into what I'm going to ask,

1105
00:59:58,825 --> 01:00:02,067
but what if your team over the course of quarantine and just remote work

1106
01:00:02,067 --> 01:00:04,408
transition to this new hybrid work style?

1107
01:00:04,408 --> 01:00:07,650
Has your, how have you been able to catch your

1108
01:00:08,773 --> 01:00:14,135
maybe bad habits of culture or like culture transitioning and adjusting in a way you,

1109
01:00:14,135 --> 01:00:20,277
but since it's not good for the workplace, how do you snip it or how do you like adjust it and

1110
01:00:20,277 --> 01:00:27,458
push it to start kind of adjusting towards your goals of your studios? I think from my perspective,

1111
01:00:27,458 --> 01:00:31,580
it's really about being very

1112
01:00:33,978 --> 01:00:38,541
I feel like I'm repeating myself, but it's about being really direct, timely, and specific

1113
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:42,403
in the feedback and in the moment and catching it and investing that time, right?

1114
01:00:42,403 --> 01:00:43,503
Don't wait for it to fester.

1115
01:00:43,503 --> 01:00:49,546
Don't spend too much time in analysis paralysis of how you'll fix it, but instead be like,

1116
01:00:49,546 --> 01:00:50,907
hey, this is what I'm seeing.

1117
01:00:50,907 --> 01:00:53,028
I feel like this is going off course.

1118
01:00:53,028 --> 01:00:57,030
Let's have a conversation about it, but I'd really like to readjust us to this, this,

1119
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:57,790
or this, right?

1120
01:00:58,031 --> 01:01:01,955
And it kind of depends on the severity of the issue and what you're seeing and is it

1121
01:01:01,955 --> 01:01:04,838
small behaviors, is it big behaviors?

1122
01:01:04,838 --> 01:01:08,962
To the example I gave in the talk of like if it's othering language, right?

1123
01:01:08,962 --> 01:01:12,866
Like just being able to call it out and put a spotlight at it in a nice way, right?

1124
01:01:12,866 --> 01:01:16,510
Like not in a way that is accusatory or makes someone feel defensive, but just be like,

1125
01:01:17,111 --> 01:01:19,692
hey, we're using shorthand and that probably doesn't work for us,

1126
01:01:19,692 --> 01:01:23,272
so let's be more specific so we can actually action on whatever you're saying.

1127
01:01:23,272 --> 01:01:28,854
Moments like that can really do it, but a lot of it is you,

1128
01:01:28,854 --> 01:01:32,695
you just have to jump in there and start addressing it as soon as you see it and

1129
01:01:32,695 --> 01:01:34,195
as specifically as possible.

1130
01:01:34,195 --> 01:01:38,496
Thank you very much. Yeah.

1131
01:01:39,288 --> 01:01:41,830
Yo, hello, I want to say thank you for your presentation.

1132
01:01:41,830 --> 01:01:43,871
I really like Yesenia's point about not necessarily

1133
01:01:43,871 --> 01:01:45,373
having to leave your life at home,

1134
01:01:45,373 --> 01:01:48,095
and you can bring it to work with the community.

1135
01:01:48,095 --> 01:01:50,837
My question comes from Game Heads,

1136
01:01:50,837 --> 01:01:53,219
where we teach students how to build video games 15 to 25

1137
01:01:53,219 --> 01:01:53,399
ages.

1138
01:01:53,399 --> 01:01:57,402
We have students who are virtual and hybrid in person.

1139
01:01:57,402 --> 01:01:58,963
We have introverts who act like extroverts,

1140
01:01:58,963 --> 01:02:00,084
and extroverts who act like introverts.

1141
01:02:00,084 --> 01:02:03,567
My question is, how do you cater activities, town hall

1142
01:02:03,567 --> 01:02:06,269
meetings, social gatherings, so that everybody's engaged

1143
01:02:06,269 --> 01:02:06,829
and included?

1144
01:02:09,471 --> 01:02:13,513
So your question is how do you interact and engage with everyone when they have all these

1145
01:02:13,513 --> 01:02:17,215
different kinds of backgrounds and how they interact and making sure everyone feels included?

1146
01:02:17,215 --> 01:02:20,417
Yeah, different personalities and energies, young and yeah.

1147
01:02:20,417 --> 01:02:28,101
Oh man, so I can only speak to a little bit about this because I feel like on our studio

1148
01:02:28,101 --> 01:02:30,623
the production team handles this very well.

1149
01:02:31,887 --> 01:02:33,588
It's a challenge, definitely, for sure,

1150
01:02:33,588 --> 01:02:37,210
because there's a lot of times where we're having like,

1151
01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:38,570
originally, here's an example.

1152
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:40,891
So originally when I did Coffee Time,

1153
01:02:40,891 --> 01:02:44,013
it was 30 minutes, all of us in one room together in Zoom

1154
01:02:44,013 --> 01:02:45,033
where we talked to each other.

1155
01:02:45,033 --> 01:02:48,615
And we realized the extroverted, hello,

1156
01:02:48,615 --> 01:02:52,397
the loud person that constantly likes to talk,

1157
01:02:52,397 --> 01:02:53,517
we were taking over the room in the call.

1158
01:02:53,517 --> 01:02:55,558
And so we had to figure out, okay,

1159
01:02:55,558 --> 01:02:58,000
how do we bring in more conversations into the fold?

1160
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:58,200
And so,

1161
01:02:58,968 --> 01:03:00,870
I kind of was watching and listening to people

1162
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:02,891
and getting their feedback in the retrospectives.

1163
01:03:02,891 --> 01:03:04,532
And then I pivoted where it's like,

1164
01:03:04,532 --> 01:03:05,753
okay, we're gonna spend,

1165
01:03:05,753 --> 01:03:07,454
now we're spending 15 minutes of it,

1166
01:03:07,454 --> 01:03:09,235
all of us kind of catching up together.

1167
01:03:09,235 --> 01:03:11,237
And then the next 15 minutes is actually,

1168
01:03:11,237 --> 01:03:13,558
I randomly assign everyone breakout rooms.

1169
01:03:13,558 --> 01:03:16,400
So this way it makes it a little bit more intimate groups

1170
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,181
and they can.

1171
01:03:17,321 --> 01:03:20,886
the people who want to talk have a chance to speak so they don't feel like

1172
01:03:20,886 --> 01:03:25,252
they're getting overpowered by people like me essentially. I totally am

1173
01:03:25,252 --> 01:03:30,780
calling myself out here and so it's really trying to find out what

1174
01:03:32,232 --> 01:03:36,976
what the problem is and like what are people's it's really about listening to your team it's

1175
01:03:36,976 --> 01:03:41,699
like okay what are what do they need what are the problem and asking the why like okay why do you

1176
01:03:41,699 --> 01:03:46,583
feel this way because once you find out why you can kind of figure out okay how do I fix this and

1177
01:03:46,583 --> 01:03:51,887
so I work really really closely with my production team and figuring out what do we need to adjust

1178
01:03:51,887 --> 01:03:57,090
and pivot on and how can we accommodate everyone else while giving

1179
01:03:57,494 --> 01:04:02,277
Yeah, unfortunately, I know we're not going to be able to fix everyone and make everyone happy.

1180
01:04:02,277 --> 01:04:08,281
I wish I could, but at least as long as I'm like 90, 95 percent there, I'm doing great.

1181
01:04:08,281 --> 01:04:10,943
All is well in my world.

1182
01:04:10,943 --> 01:04:17,467
For your specific situation, I would also encourage almost teaching a session on

1183
01:04:17,467 --> 01:04:22,991
facilitation exercises and facilitation skills, right? And in that way, you can help bring many

1184
01:04:22,991 --> 01:04:27,253
of those students into the problem of like, hey, this is.

1185
01:04:27,434 --> 01:04:32,598
Facilitation is a skill, being able to pay attention to Zoom, being able to do active listening is a skill.

1186
01:04:32,598 --> 01:04:45,828
And so one, you know, putting a spotlight on that, but then also giving some folks at least the bare bones basics of that can then help for everyone to be more of an active facilitator during those conversations.

1187
01:04:45,828 --> 01:04:50,372
I also find that it's about having a variety of activities, not a one size fits all, right?

1188
01:04:50,372 --> 01:04:56,377
Like, you're never going to be able to create a single Zoom meeting that solves for all the extroverts and all the introverts and all the people.

1189
01:04:56,817 --> 01:05:00,980
who are Star Wars versus Star Trek nerds or, you know, whatever combination you want to

1190
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:01,581
throw in there.

1191
01:05:01,581 --> 01:05:06,624
And so things that we found is where you have Zoom meetings that will tend to be taken up

1192
01:05:06,624 --> 01:05:11,207
by people who are more reactive, active speakers, right?

1193
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:15,530
Like if you have the ability to do stuff where people can prepare their thoughts ahead of

1194
01:05:15,530 --> 01:05:19,133
time, like during retros, we set up a mirror board where people can start putting their

1195
01:05:19,133 --> 01:05:19,914
thoughts ahead of time.

1196
01:05:19,914 --> 01:05:21,255
It allows people who are slower.

1197
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:25,800
processors to put that stuff ahead of time and then also having room where

1198
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:30,044
teams will often do just like hey we're gonna go hang out in discord and that

1199
01:05:30,044 --> 01:05:34,729
that change in vibe of an active meeting where you almost feel performative in a

1200
01:05:34,729 --> 01:05:38,353
zoom versus just chilling in discord while we all work allows different

1201
01:05:38,353 --> 01:05:42,438
voices to come to the fore and you sort of have to

1202
01:05:42,899 --> 01:05:49,664
do a little bit of all of it, and you have to know who the facilitators within your group are to make sure that they're watching for it as well.

1203
01:05:49,664 --> 01:05:52,667
But the more facilitators you can have, the more successful you'll be.

1204
01:05:52,667 --> 01:06:00,634
I've got to run everyone because I have a flight to catch, but if you need to reach out to me, feel free.

1205
01:06:00,634 --> 01:06:05,838
You guys are assuming you're hanging on. Yeah, we'll take this one last question. Thank you. Thank you.

1206
01:06:05,838 --> 01:06:08,881
Oh, did you see the... Okay, I got it.

1207
01:06:13,115 --> 01:06:14,476
Hi, yes.

1208
01:06:14,476 --> 01:06:16,657
First off, I want to thank you guys, great talk,

1209
01:06:16,657 --> 01:06:19,979
and especially thank you for talking all about transparency.

1210
01:06:19,979 --> 01:06:22,620
I feel like I'm so annoyed at just,

1211
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:24,141
not even just in the games industry,

1212
01:06:24,141 --> 01:06:25,862
but just in general life,

1213
01:06:25,862 --> 01:06:27,883
about everyone dancing around subjects

1214
01:06:27,883 --> 01:06:31,825
and just not talking about what they feel.

1215
01:06:31,825 --> 01:06:33,847
Me and my friends were talking the other day,

1216
01:06:33,847 --> 01:06:36,008
one of them said something and it upset the other one.

1217
01:06:36,008 --> 01:06:37,469
They actually had a conversation about it,

1218
01:06:37,469 --> 01:06:40,150
it was totally resolved and it was very refreshing.

1219
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:40,350
Bye.

1220
01:06:40,770 --> 01:06:45,054
The question I want to ask is, you guys talked a lot about like,

1221
01:06:45,054 --> 01:06:48,397
like, uh, there's like town halls and getting feedback and kind of like, uh.

1222
01:06:51,087 --> 01:06:54,410
like gauging how things are going from your teams

1223
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:55,531
and stuff like that.

1224
01:06:55,531 --> 01:06:59,874
And I've been in situations a lot where I go to my team

1225
01:06:59,874 --> 01:07:02,035
and I'm like, hey, how's everything going?

1226
01:07:02,035 --> 01:07:04,617
What are things that people are like doing things?

1227
01:07:04,617 --> 01:07:06,959
And like, it seems like things are going wrong,

1228
01:07:06,959 --> 01:07:09,101
but then just no one says anything.

1229
01:07:09,101 --> 01:07:11,602
So how do you kind of like draw people

1230
01:07:11,602 --> 01:07:14,384
to actually talk about things that they're worried about?

1231
01:07:14,384 --> 01:07:16,486
Oh my gosh.

1232
01:07:16,486 --> 01:07:19,949
Yeah, that, it's a very big topic.

1233
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:26,985
The piece that I would say to sort of broach it is a lot of that comes down to people are

1234
01:07:26,985 --> 01:07:32,932
going to speak up in places that they feel safe and that they have a lot of trust and

1235
01:07:32,932 --> 01:07:33,813
belonging.

1236
01:07:33,813 --> 01:07:38,157
And so if you find that folks in group settings are not doing that, then there's probably

1237
01:07:38,157 --> 01:07:41,721
work to be done in building the overall trust within the group.

1238
01:07:42,688 --> 01:07:46,132
That is in and of itself probably three GDC talks,

1239
01:07:46,132 --> 01:07:48,675
but really starting with understanding,

1240
01:07:48,675 --> 01:07:52,419
hey, how can we build trust and belonging within this group?

1241
01:07:52,419 --> 01:07:54,781
And that's gonna start at smaller scales, right?

1242
01:07:54,781 --> 01:07:56,263
Like you're not gonna be able to pull everyone

1243
01:07:56,263 --> 01:07:58,005
into a single room and do some trust falls

1244
01:07:58,005 --> 01:07:58,666
and it'll be all good.

1245
01:07:59,647 --> 01:08:04,212
You know, just slowly working on that problem and that kind of starts with you yourself,

1246
01:08:04,212 --> 01:08:06,575
making sure that you have the trust of the people in the room.

1247
01:08:06,575 --> 01:08:11,360
And so even if you can't get feedback in a group setting, can you get it in individual

1248
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:12,401
setting?

1249
01:08:12,401 --> 01:08:17,507
And if you're still having to pull really hard or not getting what or are you over here ... ... ... ... ... ... ...

1250
01:08:18,708 --> 01:08:24,050
people complain about things outside of your line of sight, it's like, okay, how can I build up my

1251
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:30,612
trust, build up my credibility with this group, make them feel safe and part of the crowd? Because

1252
01:08:30,612 --> 01:08:35,934
once they feel trusted and belonging to the group, they'll be much more open and candid with that

1253
01:08:35,934 --> 01:08:42,316
stuff. And that's a very long journey, but it's a worthwhile one and there's a lot of techniques out

1254
01:08:42,316 --> 01:08:42,416
there.

1255
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:44,322
Yeah, I totally agree with you.

1256
01:08:44,322 --> 01:08:47,725
It's all about setting those belonging cues with your team,

1257
01:08:47,725 --> 01:08:50,909
making them feel safe, because that's at the core value.

1258
01:08:50,909 --> 01:08:53,071
Everyone wants to feel safe, and if they don't feel safe,

1259
01:08:53,071 --> 01:08:54,973
they're not willing to talk to you or speak up.

1260
01:08:54,973 --> 01:08:58,517
And so, that's what my talk was mostly about,

1261
01:08:58,517 --> 01:08:59,699
is just building that environment

1262
01:08:59,699 --> 01:09:01,681
where people can talk to you,

1263
01:09:01,681 --> 01:09:03,282
and they enjoy working with you,

1264
01:09:03,282 --> 01:09:04,484
and they'll tell you about stuff.

1265
01:09:05,385 --> 01:09:11,549
I'm because of that I've had those situations where my team members tell me everything even

1266
01:09:11,549 --> 01:09:16,493
if it's not in a large setting they'll talk feel safe enough to talk to me individually

1267
01:09:16,493 --> 01:09:21,697
about issues and it's a lot of especially for us on the production side it's a lot of like

1268
01:09:21,697 --> 01:09:24,599
observing and noticing and we have like

1269
01:09:25,345 --> 01:09:26,866
our ears to the ground at all times.

1270
01:09:26,866 --> 01:09:29,028
Like we know what's happening at all moments.

1271
01:09:29,028 --> 01:09:30,810
And so just being observant as well too,

1272
01:09:30,810 --> 01:09:32,732
like listening, checking in on your team,

1273
01:09:32,732 --> 01:09:35,374
as I mentioned, really helps with that as well too.

1274
01:09:35,374 --> 01:09:37,236
Cause then you'll know like something's off,

1275
01:09:37,236 --> 01:09:38,637
let me go check in on this person.

1276
01:09:40,597 --> 01:09:47,765
I'd say it's also, it's easier to sort of build trust than it is to repair trust.

1277
01:09:47,765 --> 01:09:51,509
And so if you're operating in a system where that trust has already been violated and people

1278
01:09:51,509 --> 01:09:56,675
don't feel like there is that accountability or that they'll be heard or they don't feel

1279
01:09:56,675 --> 01:09:58,758
like there's that relationship already there.

1280
01:09:59,238 --> 01:10:05,284
that's a lot more difficult of an environment to go into than if you're sort of starting fresh.

1281
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:11,670
But if that is the case for your environment, then you still have to start somewhere

1282
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:17,536
in that sort of reparative journey. But as they were both saying, it takes time

1283
01:10:17,536 --> 01:10:20,439
and it takes even longer if that's already been violated.

1284
01:10:20,439 --> 01:10:22,301
So luckily it's not there yet.

1285
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:29,021
And this is totally not a sponsored advertising for this, but I recommend this book called The Culture Code,

1286
01:10:29,021 --> 01:10:34,582
where us at Brassline, we read it and we talk about it and it's great.

1287
01:10:34,582 --> 01:10:41,384
And it talks about setting those belonging cues with your team members to make sure that they feel valued and heard.

1288
01:10:41,384 --> 01:10:45,765
So it's called Culture Code. You can get it on Amazon. This is not a sponsored message.

1289
01:10:45,765 --> 01:10:48,145
Or at your local bookstore.

1290
01:10:57,310 --> 01:10:58,551
Awesome, well thank you very much.

1291
01:10:58,551 --> 01:10:58,811
Cool.

1292
01:10:58,811 --> 01:10:58,971
Thank you.

1293
01:10:58,971 --> 01:10:59,732
Thank you so much everyone.

1294
01:10:59,732 --> 01:11:00,192
Thanks for coming.

1295
01:11:00,192 --> 01:11:00,712
Thank you.

1296
01:11:00,712 --> 01:11:01,093
Thanks.

1297
01:11:01,093 --> 01:11:01,313
Thanks.

1298
01:11:01,313 --> 01:11:01,513
Thanks.

1299
01:11:01,513 --> 01:11:01,693
Thanks.

1300
01:11:01,693 --> 01:11:01,873
Thanks.

1301
01:11:01,873 --> 01:11:02,674
Thanks.

1302
01:11:02,674 --> 01:11:03,294
Thanks.
