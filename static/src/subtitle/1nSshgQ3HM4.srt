1
00:00:04,633 --> 00:00:05,915
Thanks, Tim.

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:09,341
All right.

3
00:00:10,142 --> 00:00:11,404
Well, thanks everyone for coming.

4
00:00:12,526 --> 00:00:14,850
I originally wanted a much longer title for our talk,

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,715
but Mike nixed it, so I can see why.

6
00:00:18,912 --> 00:00:21,092
Okay, introductions, quick introductions.

7
00:00:21,112 --> 00:00:23,213
So I'm Jeff Harawar, I'm senior software engineer

8
00:00:23,253 --> 00:00:27,274
at EA Vancouver, currently lead gameplay engineer on UFC.

9
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:29,795
I've been working in the industry since 2000,

10
00:00:30,435 --> 00:00:33,456
so I've been working at EA for 16 years,

11
00:00:33,636 --> 00:00:36,497
which, along with my increasingly thinning hair,

12
00:00:36,717 --> 00:00:37,937
makes me feel very, very old.

13
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:43,219
And I'm Jerry Matheson, lead gameplay animator

14
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:45,520
at EA Sports and the UFC 2 title.

15
00:00:47,507 --> 00:00:49,770
Been in the industry since like 1999.

16
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,492
Started at Mainframe Entertainment making kids cartoons

17
00:00:52,572 --> 00:00:54,154
and now I'm here making video games.

18
00:00:58,087 --> 00:00:58,407
All right.

19
00:00:59,027 --> 00:01:00,807
So here's an outline of what we're

20
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:01,788
going to be talking about today.

21
00:01:01,988 --> 00:01:03,848
So I'm going to go first, and I'll

22
00:01:03,888 --> 00:01:06,049
be talking about all the technical engineering stuff.

23
00:01:06,949 --> 00:01:09,589
I'll give you an overview of our dynamic grappling system,

24
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,070
kind of the design change that we went through from UFC 1

25
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,511
to UFC 2, and talk about how that influenced

26
00:01:16,631 --> 00:01:17,991
our animation requirements.

27
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:21,973
I'm going to do a bit of a technical deep dive on the relative IK system.

28
00:01:21,993 --> 00:01:23,534
I talked about that a little bit last year.

29
00:01:24,975 --> 00:01:27,876
Looking back at my talk, I don't think I explained it very well, and there's a lot more depth

30
00:01:27,936 --> 00:01:31,538
I could have gone into, so I'm going to dive into that because it's kind of a fundamental

31
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:34,879
building block to the procedural system we put together this year.

32
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,061
And then I'll go over what we called procedural mocap.

33
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:43,943
It's a term that Jeremy coined after seeing how this stuff worked, how we solved our grappling

34
00:01:44,144 --> 00:01:45,064
problems for this year.

35
00:01:46,432 --> 00:01:53,356
And I'm going to talk about essentially how one gameplay animator can create that much content for a feature.

36
00:01:53,757 --> 00:02:01,242
I'm going to start with UFC 1, you can see doing it the old way, how much content we created, and then on UFC 2, how we improved on that.

37
00:02:01,582 --> 00:02:07,026
And a big key part of that is just procedural techniques that kind of aided us in a big way on that.

38
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:10,208
And then I'll come to a conclusion where we've arrived.

39
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:14,261
So this is a big exciting week for us. Our game launches tomorrow.

40
00:02:14,622 --> 00:02:17,424
So if you're not familiar with our game or the UFC,

41
00:02:17,824 --> 00:02:22,348
here's a hype trailer to get you all excited for the talk.

42
00:02:58,681 --> 00:02:58,801
Wow!

43
00:02:58,822 --> 00:02:59,283
Holly Holm!

44
00:02:59,384 --> 00:02:59,826
Ronda Rousey!

45
00:03:48,205 --> 00:03:55,269
All right. There we go. Game looks fun. Yay. Thanks. Okay. So

46
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:58,111
one of the big back of the box features for this year's game is

47
00:03:58,131 --> 00:04:02,134
something that we called dynamic grappling. So to understand what

48
00:04:02,174 --> 00:04:05,216
that system is, I'll take you back to UFC 1 and talk about the

49
00:04:05,256 --> 00:04:09,099
grappling system there. So it's pretty straightforward kind of

50
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:12,821
stuff. So when you take the guy to the ground, you start off in

51
00:04:12,881 --> 00:04:14,823
some kind of idle depending on what position you're in.

52
00:04:15,543 --> 00:04:17,407
The top fighter has a bunch of things he can do.

53
00:04:17,448 --> 00:04:19,111
The bottom fighter has a bunch of things he can do.

54
00:04:20,314 --> 00:04:23,220
Let's simplify it a little bit and say the top guy can go left

55
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,284
or right, and the bottom guy can go left or right.

56
00:04:27,577 --> 00:04:30,478
So if the top guy presses to the left,

57
00:04:31,299 --> 00:04:33,780
he'll play an animation of him doing something to the left.

58
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,381
That could be a submission, a transition attempt.

59
00:04:36,421 --> 00:04:38,842
In this case, he's trying to pass the bottom guy's guard

60
00:04:39,602 --> 00:04:40,642
by pressing down on the knee.

61
00:04:41,122 --> 00:04:43,983
So you've got a start animation to initiate the action.

62
00:04:44,023 --> 00:04:47,125
You've got an idle pose where the game kind of figures

63
00:04:47,165 --> 00:04:48,305
out the transition logic.

64
00:04:48,825 --> 00:04:50,966
And then you have a cancel animation

65
00:04:51,026 --> 00:04:52,927
to bring you back from where you came from,

66
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,868
and a finish animation that executes the technique

67
00:04:55,908 --> 00:04:56,908
and takes you to where you're going.

68
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,020
Similarly, the guy on the bottom presses to the right,

69
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,482
he'll play some move in that direction.

70
00:05:05,742 --> 00:05:07,222
Similar thing, a submission, transition,

71
00:05:07,242 --> 00:05:07,742
something like that.

72
00:05:11,204 --> 00:05:14,585
So what happens if the top guy presses to the left

73
00:05:14,725 --> 00:05:16,166
and the bottom guy presses to the left

74
00:05:16,286 --> 00:05:17,186
at the exact same time?

75
00:05:18,006 --> 00:05:19,867
So in UFC 1,

76
00:05:23,988 --> 00:05:25,489
the top guy pressed to the left,

77
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:26,970
he would play his transition animation.

78
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:30,479
But if the bottom guy also pressed to the right

79
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:33,920
and the game registered the input just one frame later,

80
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,320
he would get absolutely nothing.

81
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,281
No response from the game that he had done anything.

82
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:40,882
He'd be locked out of any transitions.

83
00:05:40,982 --> 00:05:42,922
The only thing he could do is recognize

84
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,702
that the top fighter had started a transition

85
00:05:45,123 --> 00:05:46,423
and play a denial animation,

86
00:05:46,883 --> 00:05:48,683
which just prevents him from doing his action.

87
00:05:49,244 --> 00:05:51,184
So this wasn't very good for users.

88
00:05:51,304 --> 00:05:52,225
They felt frustrated.

89
00:05:53,605 --> 00:05:55,226
Oftentimes, they'd be pressing on the stick

90
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:56,186
and get no response.

91
00:05:56,246 --> 00:05:57,647
They thought the game was broken.

92
00:05:57,707 --> 00:05:58,467
It's unresponsive.

93
00:05:58,507 --> 00:05:59,527
I don't understand how to play.

94
00:06:00,668 --> 00:06:02,788
Just generally a bad, bad experience for people.

95
00:06:07,015 --> 00:06:08,937
So in an ideal world, we want something like this,

96
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:13,462
where top guy presses to the left, and he gets an action.

97
00:06:13,502 --> 00:06:15,565
Bottom guy presses to the right, he also gets an action.

98
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,927
So the two players could act independent of each other,

99
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:21,031
playing an animation that corresponded

100
00:06:21,051 --> 00:06:22,612
to what they were trying to do, no matter

101
00:06:22,653 --> 00:06:23,754
what the other guy was trying to do.

102
00:06:23,974 --> 00:06:27,818
Increase responsiveness, increase that sense

103
00:06:27,898 --> 00:06:29,120
of engagement with the game.

104
00:06:33,563 --> 00:06:36,043
So let's get a sense of what kind of numbers

105
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,904
we're looking at in order to support a feature like that.

106
00:06:39,664 --> 00:06:42,585
So just in full guard, this position here,

107
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,905
let's say the top guy has eight possible transitions.

108
00:06:45,925 --> 00:06:48,766
He could do eight transition submissions, whatever.

109
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:51,347
So left, right, up, down, and then holding a modifier,

110
00:06:51,547 --> 00:06:52,247
left, right, up, down.

111
00:06:53,127 --> 00:06:55,507
And the bottom guy also has eight transitions, say,

112
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:56,228
for example.

113
00:06:57,068 --> 00:06:57,548
Similar deal.

114
00:06:59,497 --> 00:07:02,538
This would represent all the different idle states

115
00:07:02,718 --> 00:07:04,880
that the players could get into in full guard.

116
00:07:07,121 --> 00:07:08,842
It's not 100% accurate.

117
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,044
This is kind of the back of the napkin kind of calculations

118
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:14,585
we were doing at the beginning to see what we were up against

119
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:15,486
to try and implement this.

120
00:07:15,506 --> 00:07:19,128
So you're looking at 8 times 8, 64 different states.

121
00:07:20,489 --> 00:07:22,370
That'd be like top guy's going to the right,

122
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,191
bottom guy's going to the left, top guy's going to the right,

123
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:25,091
bottom guy's going down.

124
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,792
All those permutations, right?

125
00:07:28,936 --> 00:07:32,460
So in order to figure out what kind of animations we need,

126
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,801
we need four different animations

127
00:07:33,841 --> 00:07:34,882
for each one of those states.

128
00:07:35,162 --> 00:07:37,385
We need something that takes you to that state,

129
00:07:37,765 --> 00:07:39,947
an idle animation once you're in that state,

130
00:07:40,408 --> 00:07:42,590
a cancel that brings you back to the state you came from,

131
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,792
and then a success animation that

132
00:07:44,812 --> 00:07:46,894
takes you to wherever you're going from each of those states.

133
00:07:46,914 --> 00:07:47,815
So we multiply by four.

134
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,594
And then the game has 15 different ground positions.

135
00:07:52,714 --> 00:07:54,537
So assuming every ground position

136
00:07:54,597 --> 00:07:57,501
has the same level of complexity as guard, which they don't,

137
00:07:57,601 --> 00:08:00,825
but some are close, some are bigger, some are smaller,

138
00:08:00,845 --> 00:08:02,688
we've got to multiply that number by 15.

139
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,831
So we've got a really big number here.

140
00:08:05,591 --> 00:08:11,976
To put that into context, this little piece that I cut out at the bottom, that's the number

141
00:08:11,996 --> 00:08:17,439
of animations that we built for the entire ground game in UFC 1, and the big picture

142
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:20,862
is what we would need to build in order to support this system for UFC 2.

143
00:08:21,842 --> 00:08:26,346
with the same budget, the same timeline, same number of animators, that kind of stuff.

144
00:08:26,386 --> 00:08:30,549
So on the face of it, it looks absolutely impossible unless we can come up with some

145
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:35,112
kind of procedural system or something, just some way to optimize this so that we can get

146
00:08:35,172 --> 00:08:37,814
like a tenfold increase in content creation.

147
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:39,635
Not trivial at all.

148
00:08:41,593 --> 00:08:45,436
So before I dive into how we did that, I want to talk about RelativeIK.

149
00:08:45,577 --> 00:08:50,440
So RelativeIK existed in EA MMA like four years ago.

150
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,722
It existed in EA UFC.

151
00:08:53,863 --> 00:08:56,845
It's used by a bunch of different games in EA Sports.

152
00:08:57,566 --> 00:09:03,710
It's a system primarily designed for playing two-player animations on characters of different scales.

153
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,733
That was kind of its first purpose, and it's taken on a different meaning this year for us.

154
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,317
I talked about it a little bit last year, but I'm going to dive into some details.

155
00:09:12,437 --> 00:09:15,380
Same rules apply. I'm not allowed to show any of the editors in our tool,

156
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:20,205
but I kind of mocked them up a little bit in PowerPoint to give you an idea of how it works.

157
00:09:20,305 --> 00:09:24,269
So, yeah, two-player animations. Let's take a look at a concrete example here.

158
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:28,814
So in this one, the bottom fighter is reaching up and grabbing the top fighter's head,

159
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:30,956
and then canceling back into the idle.

160
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:32,398
So...

161
00:09:33,895 --> 00:09:40,137
What does that look like if we make the bottom fighter's arm comically large?

162
00:09:42,977 --> 00:09:45,818
Obviously the contact points don't line up.

163
00:09:46,898 --> 00:09:48,119
The animation completely breaks.

164
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:53,620
So, with the relative IK system, what we do is we offer a constraint

165
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,181
between the left hand of the bottom fighter and the head of the top fighter.

166
00:09:59,021 --> 00:10:01,763
And we bake out the position of the hand relative to the head

167
00:10:02,263 --> 00:10:04,805
into a new channel in the rig for every frame

168
00:10:05,065 --> 00:10:05,746
of that animation.

169
00:10:06,686 --> 00:10:08,047
This is not how it works under the hood,

170
00:10:08,087 --> 00:10:10,969
but conceptually think of it as a bone that's

171
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:12,750
parented to the head of the top fighter

172
00:10:13,191 --> 00:10:17,974
in the top fighter's rig that's just constrained to the hand,

173
00:10:18,394 --> 00:10:20,075
say, in MotionBuilder, and then baked out

174
00:10:20,115 --> 00:10:21,036
with that global position.

175
00:10:22,277 --> 00:10:27,020
Now, you might be thinking, how are you going to generalize that?

176
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,982
There's, like, the hand could be relative to the head, to the arm,

177
00:10:30,642 --> 00:10:34,345
any number of joints on the other character's skeleton, and vice versa.

178
00:10:34,365 --> 00:10:36,787
Are you going to put that many joints in the skeleton?

179
00:10:37,507 --> 00:10:40,409
One of our really clever engineers, Dominic Parker,

180
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:42,891
figured out a way of encoding that information in the rig

181
00:10:42,951 --> 00:10:44,932
so that we could do it with a limited number of slots,

182
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,414
and it would blend across animations.

183
00:10:47,474 --> 00:10:49,635
That's kind of the secret sauce of this solution.

184
00:10:50,135 --> 00:10:53,438
But if you have like a limited number of joints you want to make relative to each other,

185
00:10:53,518 --> 00:10:56,200
the bone approach is pretty much exactly what we're doing here.

186
00:10:56,941 --> 00:11:00,263
So we bake out the path of the hand relative to the head all throughout the animation,

187
00:11:01,124 --> 00:11:08,929
and the animators can author a curve that defines how tightly the hand is following that constraint.

188
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:13,253
So it can become relative to the head, it can kind of ramp in as it starts approaching the head,

189
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:17,796
be at 100% when he's holding the head, and then ramp back down to zero as he lets go.

190
00:11:18,837 --> 00:11:23,902
So when we play back this long-armed character on the same animation,

191
00:11:24,322 --> 00:11:28,126
we now have a target point for the hand relative to the other guy's head.

192
00:11:28,506 --> 00:11:32,610
We just snap it to there using IK, and away we go.

193
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:36,274
So this is what that simple example looks like

194
00:11:36,874 --> 00:11:38,376
once you turn on the relative IK system.

195
00:11:39,397 --> 00:11:40,218
Pretty decent results.

196
00:11:42,675 --> 00:11:46,037
So, that works well for when the arm gets really long,

197
00:11:46,578 --> 00:11:47,959
and you need to figure out where to put it.

198
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:51,201
What happens if the top fighter's head gets really, really big?

199
00:11:51,441 --> 00:11:53,042
That same approach doesn't work.

200
00:11:54,643 --> 00:11:57,085
So what we did, this is new for UFC 2.

201
00:11:57,646 --> 00:12:01,408
In the talk last year, I was saying that we wanted to move our IK system

202
00:12:01,609 --> 00:12:06,252
into the physics system, because we're having a lot of fighting between the IK and physics.

203
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,682
One would be pulling in one direction, I could be pulling in the other, and you'd never really

204
00:12:09,742 --> 00:12:10,383
resolve anything.

205
00:12:10,923 --> 00:12:16,268
We accomplished that, and it gave us some new tools to use when trying to calculate

206
00:12:16,308 --> 00:12:16,968
these constraints.

207
00:12:17,489 --> 00:12:22,673
So what we do now is we cast a ray from the head to the hand.

208
00:12:23,214 --> 00:12:26,834
and figure out where that ray intersects with the collision volumes.

209
00:12:27,194 --> 00:12:30,895
And then we use those collision points on the surface of the mesh

210
00:12:31,235 --> 00:12:32,996
to define the relative constraints.

211
00:12:33,136 --> 00:12:34,716
So now, as the head gets bigger,

212
00:12:35,696 --> 00:12:38,357
the relative contact point moves out

213
00:12:38,437 --> 00:12:43,018
depending on the arbitrary size and shape of the collision geometry

214
00:12:43,418 --> 00:12:43,978
that's underneath.

215
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:48,639
So, let's look at that in action.

216
00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:50,120
If I grow the top guy's head...

217
00:12:51,326 --> 00:12:53,066
and grow the bottom guy's arm,

218
00:12:54,527 --> 00:12:56,807
you'll see the results that you'd expect.

219
00:12:57,567 --> 00:12:59,008
The animation plays back.

220
00:13:01,888 --> 00:13:04,689
So that's a simple example, but in our game,

221
00:13:05,949 --> 00:13:07,329
we've got animations like this,

222
00:13:08,349 --> 00:13:11,870
where the characters are all tangled up like spaghetti.

223
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:15,211
So someone has to go in and author all those constraints.

224
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,491
Now, that was a huge time-consuming process in UFC 1.

225
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:23,133
One of our engineers, John Tu, wrote an offline batch process

226
00:13:23,153 --> 00:13:24,953
to go through and analyze all the motion,

227
00:13:25,453 --> 00:13:28,534
figure out which joints were in close proximity to others

228
00:13:28,614 --> 00:13:31,055
and where they settled, and came up with a first pass

229
00:13:31,095 --> 00:13:32,696
of all the constraint authoring on these.

230
00:13:32,976 --> 00:13:34,356
And then sometimes they would work,

231
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:35,156
sometimes they wouldn't.

232
00:13:35,236 --> 00:13:36,537
Animators would have to go through and...

233
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:41,100
Tweak them in some cases just a little bit, in other cases a lot.

234
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:45,084
But we were able to speed up the process by automating that stuff,

235
00:13:45,384 --> 00:13:50,128
and every single animation in the game has a set of these constraints built into it.

236
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:54,252
That's kind of the base set of building blocks that I had to work with

237
00:13:55,073 --> 00:13:56,895
when putting together this procedural solution.

238
00:13:57,547 --> 00:14:02,092
Now, I've talked about using this for skill compensation,

239
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,614
but it can also be used for other techniques.

240
00:14:04,475 --> 00:14:07,258
One that we use often in UFC 1 is animating

241
00:14:07,318 --> 00:14:09,720
against a static punching dummy.

242
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:11,723
So you have a guy on top of another guy,

243
00:14:11,783 --> 00:14:14,325
and the bottom guy's animation is perfectly still.

244
00:14:15,006 --> 00:14:15,927
There's nothing animating there.

245
00:14:15,947 --> 00:14:18,110
And the other guy would just punch at his head,

246
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,071
grab his arm, or whatever.

247
00:14:19,631 --> 00:14:23,372
And then you could play that animation against any animation for the bottom guy,

248
00:14:23,392 --> 00:14:25,612
and it would just track and move appropriately.

249
00:14:25,692 --> 00:14:29,193
So it was a good way of kind of reusing animations in two-player context.

250
00:14:29,673 --> 00:14:35,175
And that type of technique is where we're going to go to with this dynamic grappling system.

251
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,055
It also worked on the feet.

252
00:14:37,475 --> 00:14:39,416
Now, I need a short volunteer.

253
00:14:39,656 --> 00:14:40,696
Tim, do you mind coming up here?

254
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:46,410
We were doing a rehearsal last night, and I know something in

255
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,391
the video that's coming up that I didn't really explain, so I

256
00:14:48,731 --> 00:14:49,731
don't have any slides for this.

257
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,652
And Tim was begging for us to do some sort of physical

258
00:14:52,712 --> 00:14:54,013
comedy, because we did it last year.

259
00:14:54,033 --> 00:14:58,514
So I'm going to use Tim as my, get closer, come on.

260
00:14:58,534 --> 00:14:59,215
We've got to get in camera.

261
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:03,222
All right, so in the next video that I show you,

262
00:15:03,883 --> 00:15:05,044
keep an eye out for this pose here.

263
00:15:05,084 --> 00:15:06,366
So this is the Muay Thai clinch.

264
00:15:07,027 --> 00:15:10,611
Now, obviously, I can do it to Tim, no problem, right?

265
00:15:11,131 --> 00:15:12,453
Now, try and do it to me.

266
00:15:13,965 --> 00:15:15,125
He's got to reach way up.

267
00:15:15,626 --> 00:15:16,506
Not easy to do, right?

268
00:15:17,366 --> 00:15:20,008
So we added a system where we could

269
00:15:20,068 --> 00:15:22,509
set constraints between arbitrary joints,

270
00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:25,631
same as in relative IK, but only on one axis.

271
00:15:25,851 --> 00:15:28,092
So you could define what axis it applies to.

272
00:15:28,392 --> 00:15:29,853
So if we're in the same pose here,

273
00:15:30,213 --> 00:15:31,934
I can apply a constraint between our hips

274
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:35,376
and IK my hips to his hips, but only in the y-axis.

275
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:36,436
So I can drop down like this.

276
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,778
And now similarly, if Tim's trying to do it to me.

277
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,895
I can drop my hips down and now he can do every move that he wants,

278
00:15:44,316 --> 00:15:46,177
I can do every move that I want against him.

279
00:15:46,818 --> 00:15:51,221
Now, obviously if Tim's doing it to me, he can't IK his hips up.

280
00:15:51,842 --> 00:15:52,822
Right? It's not possible.

281
00:15:53,503 --> 00:15:57,706
So what we did was we created conditional constraints

282
00:15:57,986 --> 00:16:01,069
where the condition could be the height difference between the fighters.

283
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:04,431
So those are a couple cool little tricks that we used in this system.

284
00:16:04,612 --> 00:16:04,932
Thanks, Tim.

285
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:06,753
Everyone, round of applause for Tim.

286
00:16:11,123 --> 00:16:15,925
So here's an example of this system working in game in UFC 2

287
00:16:15,965 --> 00:16:17,886
with one of the most extreme height differences

288
00:16:17,926 --> 00:16:18,286
that we have.

289
00:16:18,326 --> 00:16:21,087
This is Stefan Struve, who's I think 7 feet tall or 6.

290
00:16:21,127 --> 00:16:22,548
7-something.

291
00:16:22,568 --> 00:16:24,328
Yeah, close to 7 against Mike Tyson.

292
00:16:24,808 --> 00:16:26,309
Not sure how tall he is, but he's pretty short.

293
00:16:26,749 --> 00:16:29,510
So you see the animations hold up pretty well.

294
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:31,431
Here he takes his back.

295
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:35,632
Pretty soon he'll get to that same high clinch position

296
00:16:36,173 --> 00:16:37,253
that I was demoing with Tim.

297
00:16:38,313 --> 00:16:38,653
Right.

298
00:16:39,334 --> 00:16:39,654
Almost.

299
00:16:39,814 --> 00:16:40,174
Next one.

300
00:16:41,977 --> 00:16:44,378
Right here. So now look at this pose, look at this animation.

301
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:48,461
These are animated against same-scale characters.

302
00:16:49,061 --> 00:16:51,362
And then Mike Tyson's going to reverse it soon

303
00:16:52,062 --> 00:16:54,143
and get the Thai clinch on Stefan Struve.

304
00:16:56,244 --> 00:16:59,185
that's the exact same animation playing back. And I can't

305
00:16:59,205 --> 00:17:02,447
believe that this works. It holds up really, really well. I

306
00:17:02,487 --> 00:17:04,668
don't even think this combination was tested by QA. We

307
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:07,849
saw it, like, last week. And we're like, oh, crap. And then

308
00:17:07,889 --> 00:17:12,151
it actually worked. So our clinch engineer, Dominic, spent

309
00:17:12,171 --> 00:17:14,672
a lot of time hand authoring that stuff. And then just for

310
00:17:14,692 --> 00:17:15,573
fun, here's another.

311
00:17:15,593 --> 00:17:19,194
Okay, I'm backing away. I'm backing away. I'm not going to

312
00:17:19,214 --> 00:17:20,875
let you hear me at first.

313
00:17:44,207 --> 00:17:47,609
That's an example of another extreme height difference that we weren't expecting to have

314
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:52,011
to support in the game and really, really tall hair that can really mess with contact

315
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:52,231
points.

316
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:56,021
Anyway, let's go back to the problem we're trying to solve.

317
00:17:56,481 --> 00:17:59,883
Huge, complex animation tree that we need to build,

318
00:18:00,164 --> 00:18:01,965
and not enough time or manpower to do it.

319
00:18:03,426 --> 00:18:07,328
So let's dig into some concrete examples here.

320
00:18:07,428 --> 00:18:10,490
This is an example that inspired the technique

321
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,711
that we used to solve this problem.

322
00:18:12,111 --> 00:18:13,832
I was looking at this animation, so the bottom guy

323
00:18:13,872 --> 00:18:14,853
just puts his hand on his knee.

324
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:15,373
That's it.

325
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:15,993
Very simple.

326
00:18:17,645 --> 00:18:20,167
And then what do I want to mix that with the top guy?

327
00:18:20,227 --> 00:18:22,409
Top guy's putting his hand on the bottom guy's knee.

328
00:18:23,229 --> 00:18:24,630
It feels to me that those should be

329
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,632
able to play independent of each other

330
00:18:26,712 --> 00:18:28,413
without a whole lot of animation work,

331
00:18:28,453 --> 00:18:30,575
because the important things are moving

332
00:18:30,595 --> 00:18:31,436
independent of each other.

333
00:18:33,257 --> 00:18:34,498
You look at them side by side.

334
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,221
There's not a whole lot of overlap

335
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:41,063
in the important movement in both the start and the cancel.

336
00:18:44,638 --> 00:18:46,499
So in order to build this prototype,

337
00:18:46,719 --> 00:18:48,300
I asked Jeremy to throw together something

338
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,541
that we called a mixed idle.

339
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:53,503
So a mixed idle is just a regular hand-authored cycle

340
00:18:53,943 --> 00:18:56,864
that is what they should look like once they get

341
00:18:56,904 --> 00:18:58,805
to this state of one guy going to the right

342
00:18:58,865 --> 00:18:59,906
and the other guy going to the left.

343
00:18:59,966 --> 00:19:01,507
So this is what Jeremy put together for me.

344
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,428
There's a lot of these, but it's not

345
00:19:04,468 --> 00:19:06,369
that exponential number in that first slide.

346
00:19:06,389 --> 00:19:08,090
This is a manageable number of animations.

347
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,731
This is what I need from him in order to even start

348
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:11,712
on some sort of solution.

349
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:25,857
So this is what we need. We need, we go from the base idle to top guy going to the left, base idle, bottom guy going to the right, and then if the bottom guy is already going to the right, top guy going to the left, and vice versa.

350
00:19:25,897 --> 00:19:35,722
So the green arrows are the animations that we have from UFC 1 to work with, and the blue arrows are the animations that we need to figure out a way to produce in a very, very cheap kind of way.

351
00:19:40,765 --> 00:19:42,766
So we need to go from the idol on the left

352
00:19:42,967 --> 00:19:43,787
to the idol on the right.

353
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:44,948
Let's focus on that example.

354
00:19:48,251 --> 00:19:50,493
Here's the animation of the bottom guy putting

355
00:19:50,533 --> 00:19:51,554
his hand on the knee.

356
00:19:51,834 --> 00:19:52,875
That seems very important.

357
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,177
So let's make that the base.

358
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:57,819
So what I'm doing here is I'm building a set of layers.

359
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,162
I know that I need this animation because that's

360
00:20:01,202 --> 00:20:01,982
the piece that's missing.

361
00:20:02,022 --> 00:20:03,264
So I put that as the base layer.

362
00:20:04,364 --> 00:20:06,386
Now, he's not coming from the right pose

363
00:20:06,426 --> 00:20:08,288
or going to the right pose in this base layer.

364
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:09,669
So I'm going to toss in the.

365
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:15,540
from idle and the to idle into my set of layers here.

366
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,382
And now I'm just going to start with the from idle, blend it out,

367
00:20:21,822 --> 00:20:24,523
and end with my to idle, so I'll blend that in.

368
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,604
So I've got a bunch of curves that I can now manipulate,

369
00:20:27,304 --> 00:20:28,685
controlling the blend to and from the idle.

370
00:20:30,346 --> 00:20:32,668
And with that setup, you get this kind of result.

371
00:20:33,489 --> 00:20:35,731
So we start at the right pose.

372
00:20:36,392 --> 00:20:38,815
What we're doing, we play the animation on the right hand

373
00:20:38,835 --> 00:20:41,417
that we want, but the top guy's hand pops to the chest

374
00:20:41,457 --> 00:20:42,318
and then back to the leg.

375
00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:45,582
So if you focus just on the right hand of the bottom

376
00:20:45,622 --> 00:20:47,184
fighter, everything looks pretty good.

377
00:20:47,224 --> 00:20:49,766
The only problem is the top fighter kind of popping around

378
00:20:49,846 --> 00:20:52,229
as he blends out to the transition animation

379
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:52,850
and back in again.

380
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,222
So I toss in two more idles, the from idle again, the to idle

381
00:21:01,262 --> 00:21:01,482
again.

382
00:21:01,962 --> 00:21:04,183
I give the ability to mask in and out

383
00:21:04,223 --> 00:21:05,764
different parts of the body on those layers,

384
00:21:05,904 --> 00:21:08,905
give another set of curves to play around with.

385
00:21:09,586 --> 00:21:12,007
Surprisingly, this next iteration

386
00:21:12,107 --> 00:21:14,528
was enough for us to solve all the problems.

387
00:21:14,868 --> 00:21:16,289
There was enough flexibility in the setup

388
00:21:16,369 --> 00:21:17,729
to get everything that we needed.

389
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,490
But I didn't know it at the time.

390
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,191
Okay, so now we change our mask.

391
00:21:26,091 --> 00:21:28,552
I want the hand animation from the base layer,

392
00:21:28,592 --> 00:21:30,793
so I mask that out, that's what that little red dot means.

393
00:21:31,733 --> 00:21:34,554
I mask in everything else for the bottom fighter

394
00:21:34,715 --> 00:21:35,635
and the top fighter.

395
00:21:37,476 --> 00:21:38,536
Or sorry, just for the bottom fighter.

396
00:21:39,477 --> 00:21:41,337
And so I want everything from the bottom fighter

397
00:21:41,437 --> 00:21:42,398
except for the right arm.

398
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:44,999
So right arm's coming from the base layer,

399
00:21:45,099 --> 00:21:47,100
everything else is coming from these from and to idols.

400
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,400
And I just do a straight crossfade

401
00:21:48,961 --> 00:21:50,481
from the from and to idols for everything

402
00:21:50,521 --> 00:21:51,242
except the right arm.

403
00:21:52,836 --> 00:21:58,760
And then similarly for the top fighter, I just do a crossfade from the source idol to

404
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,583
the destination idol, because he's not doing anything interesting with his body.

405
00:22:02,803 --> 00:22:06,265
So we just, there's subtle changes in the idol, but we just do a crossfade there.

406
00:22:07,146 --> 00:22:11,069
And this is the result that we get when we do that kind of layering.

407
00:22:11,849 --> 00:22:12,590
Hey, that looks good.

408
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:13,551
I can work with that.

409
00:22:14,091 --> 00:22:15,011
This got me really excited.

410
00:22:15,071 --> 00:22:16,152
I think we've solved the problem.

411
00:22:16,172 --> 00:22:20,073
Let's try some more examples just to see what happens.

412
00:22:20,553 --> 00:22:22,354
And at this point, everything's hand-authored.

413
00:22:22,454 --> 00:22:23,634
All these curves are hand-authored.

414
00:22:24,734 --> 00:22:26,775
Here's an example where there's quite a bit more motion

415
00:22:27,115 --> 00:22:28,576
in the body of the bottom fighter.

416
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,337
But the curve setup and the masking setup

417
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:33,317
is surprisingly similar to the first one.

418
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,752
So using that technique, we get a result like this.

419
00:22:37,572 --> 00:22:40,134
Doesn't look like super great, but it's passable.

420
00:22:40,354 --> 00:22:41,295
We could put this in the game.

421
00:22:41,355 --> 00:22:42,936
I could ship with this if I have to,

422
00:22:43,877 --> 00:22:45,378
but it could certainly look a lot better.

423
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:46,778
So now I'm starting to get a little nervous.

424
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:49,360
This might work, but it might not work.

425
00:22:50,021 --> 00:22:51,221
Let's see where it goes from here.

426
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:57,805
Just as a test, I got Jeremy to take this into MotionBuilder

427
00:22:57,825 --> 00:22:59,866
and clean it up and see what he came up with.

428
00:23:00,126 --> 00:23:02,546
And the timing, but not spend a lot of time on it.

429
00:23:02,566 --> 00:23:03,966
Because I was like, OK, if we have

430
00:23:03,986 --> 00:23:06,227
to tweak some of these by hand, how much work

431
00:23:06,267 --> 00:23:06,927
are we looking at?

432
00:23:07,307 --> 00:23:09,088
So the one on the right is the tweaked animation

433
00:23:09,108 --> 00:23:09,628
that Jeremy did.

434
00:23:09,668 --> 00:23:12,569
The one on the left is the fully procedurally generated one.

435
00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:14,989
The one on the right looks better,

436
00:23:15,049 --> 00:23:17,030
but it didn't take a lot of time for him

437
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,350
to put that one together.

438
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,510
And the improvements.

439
00:23:20,831 --> 00:23:27,812
minimal. The timing looks better. It's not quite as lurpy. But yeah, we're still in a good spot

440
00:23:27,832 --> 00:23:35,174
here. Here's another example that came later in production when we realized that we could use

441
00:23:35,194 --> 00:23:39,115
this for strikes too. So this is something that the bottom fighter can do. He can punch the top

442
00:23:39,135 --> 00:23:40,676
fighter in the head while they're idling here.

443
00:23:43,607 --> 00:23:45,788
And I wanted him to be able to punch the guy in the head

444
00:23:45,908 --> 00:23:48,349
while the top guy was in the middle of doing something,

445
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:50,170
so that you get that continuity of punching,

446
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,390
no matter what the top guy's doing.

447
00:23:51,871 --> 00:23:54,472
So we put this animation in the same system.

448
00:23:55,072 --> 00:23:56,913
Instead of the from idle to idle setup,

449
00:23:56,973 --> 00:23:58,653
it was all just the idle that I want

450
00:23:58,673 --> 00:23:59,634
to use all the way through.

451
00:24:01,474 --> 00:24:03,135
Take the arm and a little bit of the torso

452
00:24:03,195 --> 00:24:04,916
and the head from the punch.

453
00:24:05,816 --> 00:24:08,557
The rest is just coming from the idle that they want to be in.

454
00:24:09,618 --> 00:24:11,098
And this is the results that we get from that.

455
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:13,300
That looks awesome.

456
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,221
That totally works.

457
00:24:15,764 --> 00:24:16,845
I can work with that as well.

458
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:18,628
So this is starting to look up.

459
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,931
There were some examples that didn't go so well.

460
00:24:24,452 --> 00:24:26,073
Anytime the guys were kind of on their feet,

461
00:24:26,853 --> 00:24:29,274
there was no way for me to get any kind of footwork.

462
00:24:30,014 --> 00:24:32,175
And no matter what I did with the curves,

463
00:24:32,255 --> 00:24:33,656
tweaked them, didn't matter.

464
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:36,117
It basically ended up like a really crappy looking

465
00:24:36,177 --> 00:24:38,098
lerp where the head passes through the hips

466
00:24:38,178 --> 00:24:39,759
and it's very slidey and linear.

467
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:41,199
And this we cannot ship with us.

468
00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:43,420
Absolutely impossible to ship the game with us.

469
00:24:45,446 --> 00:24:50,398
So what we ended up with in the end was a spectrum of animations.

470
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:57,852
The masking and layers and curve setup that I showed you,

471
00:24:59,113 --> 00:25:01,194
that was final, that's what we ended up using.

472
00:25:01,614 --> 00:25:04,515
We were able to use the same pattern

473
00:25:04,575 --> 00:25:09,017
for so many transitions with that lerping all bones

474
00:25:09,057 --> 00:25:10,618
except for these, masking out this,

475
00:25:11,338 --> 00:25:13,059
but they were all kind of different masks

476
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:14,720
and different layers, so what we did was

477
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,281
we put together a process where we could identify

478
00:25:17,321 --> 00:25:19,162
the relative IK constraints that were the same

479
00:25:19,202 --> 00:25:20,843
between the source and destination idles.

480
00:25:22,824 --> 00:25:26,309
and procedurally generate these curves and masks as a first pass.

481
00:25:26,349 --> 00:25:28,833
And that worked for a large, large number of animations.

482
00:25:29,314 --> 00:25:31,517
But then there were other ones where we had to tweak some of the curves

483
00:25:31,537 --> 00:25:33,800
to try and get a little bit better results.

484
00:25:34,221 --> 00:25:36,885
And then there were other ones where tweaking the curves wasn't enough.

485
00:25:37,505 --> 00:25:39,306
So we built a pipeline that would bake out

486
00:25:39,406 --> 00:25:42,628
the resulting animation into an animation that

487
00:25:42,668 --> 00:25:44,489
could be edited in MotionBuilder.

488
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,570
It's kind of like a one-button export straight

489
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,351
into MotionBuilder.

490
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:49,612
The animator could spend an hour cleaning it up.

491
00:25:49,972 --> 00:25:51,933
It would go straight back into game already hooked up.

492
00:25:52,714 --> 00:25:54,735
And finally, we had some that were just so bad

493
00:25:54,775 --> 00:25:56,275
that we had to use traditional mocap.

494
00:25:56,576 --> 00:25:57,756
So we had a spectrum here.

495
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:01,878
I was aiming for fully procedural

496
00:26:01,918 --> 00:26:04,120
because you get all the memory savings from that.

497
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,821
Obviously, a lot less work.

498
00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:09,002
But we were sitting in a place where we knew not everything

499
00:26:09,042 --> 00:26:09,783
was going to work that way.

500
00:26:09,863 --> 00:26:12,764
What we didn't know is how many would fall

501
00:26:12,824 --> 00:26:14,325
in which part of the spectrum.

502
00:26:15,145 --> 00:26:17,966
So we had the following concerns coming out of PrePro.

503
00:26:18,227 --> 00:26:19,747
Huge memory concerns, because if we

504
00:26:19,767 --> 00:26:21,628
have to do a tenfold increase in animations

505
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:23,189
without increasing our memory budget,

506
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:24,650
we just can't do this feature.

507
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,310
The other one was the quality concerns.

508
00:26:26,371 --> 00:26:27,931
How many are going to be on the mocap side?

509
00:26:27,991 --> 00:26:29,872
How many are going to be on this fully procedural side?

510
00:26:30,472 --> 00:26:32,213
And are we going to be able to create enough content

511
00:26:32,874 --> 00:26:33,494
to support this?

512
00:26:35,689 --> 00:26:40,598
One of our brilliant engineers, Sam Rigamonte, put together an animation streaming solution for us.

513
00:26:40,698 --> 00:26:42,963
So, I'm not going to go into a ton of detail here, but...

514
00:26:43,861 --> 00:26:45,962
Because of the rigid nature of our state machine,

515
00:26:47,242 --> 00:26:51,664
if you're idling in state A, you have all those red lines

516
00:26:52,364 --> 00:26:53,305
already loaded in memory.

517
00:26:53,485 --> 00:26:54,905
If the guy presses on the stick, you

518
00:26:54,925 --> 00:26:56,766
can just play that animation because it's

519
00:26:56,926 --> 00:26:57,687
resident in memory.

520
00:26:58,207 --> 00:26:59,547
As soon as you play an animation that

521
00:26:59,587 --> 00:27:02,709
transitions you from A to B, we unload all the animations

522
00:27:02,749 --> 00:27:05,610
that come out of state A, start loading all the animations that

523
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:06,330
come out of state B.

524
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:13,152
And as long as you can load all those animations in the same amount of time that it takes you to play back the animation from A to B, you're golden.

525
00:27:13,812 --> 00:27:15,092
And he got the system working.

526
00:27:15,932 --> 00:27:18,413
So now we're sitting in a place where memory is not a concern.

527
00:27:18,993 --> 00:27:24,014
And we have a system that will scale up ridiculously big for future iterations of the game.

528
00:27:24,074 --> 00:27:27,095
So, super excited about that. Memory is no longer a concern.

529
00:27:28,295 --> 00:27:29,695
The big concern was the quality.

530
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:35,656
We had no idea if we could get this done on time or to a quality level that was necessary to ship the game.

531
00:27:36,353 --> 00:27:37,593
So we kind of took a leap of faith here.

532
00:27:38,173 --> 00:27:39,174
There was nothing else we could do.

533
00:27:40,734 --> 00:27:44,555
We mitigated risk by focusing on workflow efficiencies

534
00:27:45,115 --> 00:27:48,036
and prioritizing the work just in case we ran out of time

535
00:27:48,076 --> 00:27:49,636
and coming up with some backup plans for some

536
00:27:49,656 --> 00:27:51,456
of the more fringe positions in the game.

537
00:27:52,957 --> 00:27:54,797
So that led us into production.

538
00:27:57,058 --> 00:27:57,618
Big unknowns.

539
00:27:58,198 --> 00:27:59,518
Not really sure if this is going to work,

540
00:27:59,899 --> 00:28:02,099
but a plan in place that kind of feels like maybe it would.

541
00:28:03,219 --> 00:28:04,540
And Jeremy will take you through production.

542
00:28:06,215 --> 00:28:06,456
Hello.

543
00:28:06,776 --> 00:28:07,136
Oh, sorry.

544
00:28:13,242 --> 00:28:15,584
Okay, so next we're gonna talk about

545
00:28:15,984 --> 00:28:18,126
the animation side of EA Sports UFC 2.

546
00:28:19,047 --> 00:28:21,349
And I think the best place to start is UFC 1.

547
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:23,451
So, I wanna turn it back to UFC 1

548
00:28:23,931 --> 00:28:27,895
and talk about our approach to workflow there.

549
00:28:28,735 --> 00:28:31,656
I want to talk about the early design and workflow approach.

550
00:28:32,176 --> 00:28:34,797
I want to talk about the changes we faced,

551
00:28:36,098 --> 00:28:38,659
and the challenges we faced, sorry, and post-mortem.

552
00:28:40,199 --> 00:28:44,041
So UFC 1, the way we faced the feature

553
00:28:44,221 --> 00:28:45,822
was the way that probably anybody does.

554
00:28:45,982 --> 00:28:48,923
I'd meet with Liam Miller, our lead game designer,

555
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:50,384
and we'd break down that feature

556
00:28:50,444 --> 00:28:51,544
and see kind of what he had in mind.

557
00:28:55,756 --> 00:29:01,818
Next, I would collect any visual reference that would help solidify this feature in my mind

558
00:29:01,858 --> 00:29:03,578
and make sure that was the same page as everybody else.

559
00:29:13,601 --> 00:29:14,121
Ah, there we go.

560
00:29:15,601 --> 00:29:20,403
And then, what we'd do often is either use a piece of paper or use a camera.

561
00:29:20,443 --> 00:29:22,603
We'd go in and we would break down.

562
00:29:23,749 --> 00:29:24,930
the individual parts of that feature.

563
00:29:25,571 --> 00:29:28,513
This is an example of a transition on the ground.

564
00:29:28,753 --> 00:29:31,014
All our transitions, for the most part, have five parts.

565
00:29:32,015 --> 00:29:36,378
Here you see Jeff and Liam are starting in the full guard position.

566
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:40,421
If the player were to press right on the stick, they would get a start animation,

567
00:29:41,002 --> 00:29:42,483
then they would enter a ready animation,

568
00:29:42,903 --> 00:29:47,086
and depending on their inputs, they would either get a success, a deny, or a cancel animation.

569
00:29:50,752 --> 00:29:55,295
So now, knowing that each transition has five parts

570
00:29:55,355 --> 00:29:58,457
and how many transitions, I can then create a shot list

571
00:29:58,837 --> 00:30:00,519
for Motion Capture Studio.

572
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,822
On the bottom right, you'll see a pose library there.

573
00:30:05,642 --> 00:30:08,504
That particular pose library has 87 pages

574
00:30:10,065 --> 00:30:12,207
with several poses on each page.

575
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,489
That's not even all our poses.

576
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:17,070
That's our Bible when we go in.

577
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,511
That's our visual reference to show the actors.

578
00:30:23,247 --> 00:30:26,168
and then we go in to the studio and we capture the data.

579
00:30:27,608 --> 00:30:29,549
If you look on the right-hand screen,

580
00:30:29,749 --> 00:30:31,790
Liam Miller is weighing down the cage,

581
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,470
and beside him is that closed library.

582
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:34,871
That thing's essential.

583
00:30:34,891 --> 00:30:40,453
And then, using proprietary software,

584
00:30:40,653 --> 00:30:43,054
I'll go back to my desk, and I will painstakingly

585
00:30:43,114 --> 00:30:44,575
and tediously order that data.

586
00:30:45,275 --> 00:30:46,315
It's not a fun process.

587
00:30:48,608 --> 00:30:51,070
And then for UFC 1 we would clean it up in-house.

588
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,991
This is Dmitri Kuprin, one of our senior animators,

589
00:30:54,071 --> 00:30:56,493
cleaning up a grapple transition.

590
00:31:00,955 --> 00:31:04,197
And then we'd review and revise to a shippable quality.

591
00:31:05,318 --> 00:31:07,219
This animation is still in the revision stage,

592
00:31:07,339 --> 00:31:10,181
but it's in good shape. It's getting there.

593
00:31:12,342 --> 00:31:13,963
So, why do we do it this way?

594
00:31:16,914 --> 00:31:19,916
We had the time and we had the headcount. We had a headcount of one

595
00:31:20,616 --> 00:31:22,298
and we figured that would be enough for this feature.

596
00:31:24,139 --> 00:31:28,762
And I was worried that the complexities of mixed martial arts and jujitsu

597
00:31:29,863 --> 00:31:32,365
would be lost in translation using STRL development.

598
00:31:33,085 --> 00:31:36,347
The sport is very technical. Our fans are very knowledgeable

599
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:38,829
and they would know if we messed up.

600
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,850
Grips have to be just so.

601
00:31:42,111 --> 00:31:43,372
posing just has to be just so.

602
00:31:43,392 --> 00:31:45,932
I was wrong in this assumption.

603
00:31:46,413 --> 00:31:48,133
For UFC 2, we did use external development,

604
00:31:48,753 --> 00:31:50,014
and it was to a huge success.

605
00:31:50,414 --> 00:31:53,315
If you guys want to hear more specifically how we did that,

606
00:31:53,775 --> 00:31:56,376
Sego Tanaka and I did a presentation at XDS

607
00:31:56,476 --> 00:31:58,617
last July in Vancouver.

608
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,398
So if you want to find out more about that.

609
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:06,800
So working that way, we ended up with 600 two-player

610
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,181
grapple animations for UFC 1.

611
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:17,372
The problems we faced working this way, our name convention discipline was lacking.

612
00:32:20,093 --> 00:32:25,554
Some animators named, for example, our half-guard position, half-guard, others named it half-G,

613
00:32:26,035 --> 00:32:30,336
some people named it start for the start animation, others attempt.

614
00:32:30,996 --> 00:32:32,796
Neither are wrong, but they are inconsistent.

615
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,921
And that made our implementation less effective

616
00:32:36,941 --> 00:32:38,882
when searching out these particular assets.

617
00:32:40,582 --> 00:32:43,564
Problems like that, and other problems

618
00:32:43,584 --> 00:32:46,145
completely different, led to overtime,

619
00:32:46,725 --> 00:32:47,926
led to late implementation,

620
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,546
which led to poor testing, poor tuning.

621
00:32:53,908 --> 00:32:54,969
Did I skip something there?

622
00:32:55,689 --> 00:32:55,849
Nope.

623
00:32:57,069 --> 00:32:58,750
So, postmortem coming out of that.

624
00:33:02,048 --> 00:33:04,670
We decided right away we definitely needed a tighter name convention.

625
00:33:08,072 --> 00:33:10,413
Because of the animation number was limited,

626
00:33:10,913 --> 00:33:15,176
this made the ground game feel linear, limited, it was turn-based,

627
00:33:16,256 --> 00:33:17,957
and visual feedback was lacking.

628
00:33:19,658 --> 00:33:22,660
We ended up with a 7 out of 10 on Metacritic, we really wanted that 8 out of 10.

629
00:33:25,082 --> 00:33:26,022
We needed a bigger game.

630
00:33:27,443 --> 00:33:28,584
We needed more animations.

631
00:33:29,619 --> 00:33:31,581
and I needed to embrace external development.

632
00:33:34,403 --> 00:33:36,805
So, moving into UFC 2's production cycle,

633
00:33:37,866 --> 00:33:40,749
I want to talk about the prototype of the ground game,

634
00:33:42,651 --> 00:33:43,651
preparing for production,

635
00:33:45,033 --> 00:33:46,013
and then production itself.

636
00:33:47,835 --> 00:33:48,796
So, the prototype.

637
00:33:49,977 --> 00:33:51,618
Early in pre-pro, Jeff came to me.

638
00:33:52,325 --> 00:33:54,166
And he said, hey, Jer, I got something to show you.

639
00:33:54,186 --> 00:33:56,648
And I came over to his desk, and he showed me

640
00:33:57,188 --> 00:33:59,169
his version of the ground game very early on.

641
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:01,411
And it looked smooth, and it looked organic,

642
00:34:01,431 --> 00:34:03,072
it looked real, and it was really exciting.

643
00:34:03,092 --> 00:34:04,253
I said, how'd you get this?

644
00:34:04,733 --> 00:34:06,094
And he said, well, I have this nifty new

645
00:34:06,234 --> 00:34:07,175
grapple controller tool.

646
00:34:08,395 --> 00:34:10,097
And he said, I just want to show you

647
00:34:10,117 --> 00:34:11,598
which kind of data it's coming out of this tool.

648
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:14,440
So he had me mock up a mixed idle,

649
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,720
which I'll explain more about later.

650
00:34:16,401 --> 00:34:18,042
And he put through two existing

651
00:34:20,067 --> 00:34:22,788
UFC won assets and kind of mixed them together.

652
00:34:23,529 --> 00:34:26,591
And what we got was this kind of weird

653
00:34:27,451 --> 00:34:29,852
programmer art, linear animation.

654
00:34:30,733 --> 00:34:32,514
I looked at it, I'm like, well that's interesting.

655
00:34:32,554 --> 00:34:33,755
I looked at it again and I thought,

656
00:34:33,795 --> 00:34:36,296
well, our mocap isn't that great either.

657
00:34:36,916 --> 00:34:39,958
And this data comes with the begin pose

658
00:34:39,998 --> 00:34:42,259
and the end pose already imprinted and perfect.

659
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,180
and all I have to do is clamp the in-between poses.

660
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,041
And I'm like, that's actually kind of really cool.

661
00:34:47,521 --> 00:34:49,221
So I was like, let's see where this goes.

662
00:34:49,261 --> 00:34:50,001
I like this so far.

663
00:34:52,942 --> 00:34:54,522
So we kind of started to break it down.

664
00:34:54,562 --> 00:34:55,743
Like, what if we did it the old way?

665
00:34:56,043 --> 00:34:57,863
And we would have to do a lot of our assets the old way,

666
00:34:57,903 --> 00:34:59,143
but what if we do everything the old way?

667
00:35:01,244 --> 00:35:03,244
You know, I still have to do it with Liam or Jeff

668
00:35:03,384 --> 00:35:04,825
and figure out how this is all gonna work.

669
00:35:04,845 --> 00:35:08,085
I still have to gather my visual reference

670
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:10,006
for the motion capture, make sure we're all on the same page.

671
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:14,571
I still have to create these mix titles, which I'll talk about more later.

672
00:35:17,092 --> 00:35:17,953
Break down the design.

673
00:35:20,814 --> 00:35:22,855
Figure out that name convention, super important.

674
00:35:24,616 --> 00:35:27,217
Create the shot list, not fun, takes a long time.

675
00:35:28,737 --> 00:35:31,218
Go in, shoot the data, can be fun, not always fun.

676
00:35:33,139 --> 00:35:36,541
Order the data, which always sucks, no one likes doing it.

677
00:35:38,635 --> 00:35:40,136
And if we did it the old way, we'd clean up in-house,

678
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,297
which we wouldn't this time, we'll use the actual development.

679
00:35:42,357 --> 00:35:43,657
Some of it in-house, some of it external.

680
00:35:44,938 --> 00:35:47,539
And then review and revise to a shipable quality.

681
00:35:48,879 --> 00:35:50,500
So we knew we couldn't do the whole game that way.

682
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,461
So what if we used Jeff's tool?

683
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:56,762
So for the procedural data, we'd make our mixed titles.

684
00:35:58,063 --> 00:36:00,083
We'd throw it through Jeff's nifty tool.

685
00:36:01,224 --> 00:36:02,224
We'd press export.

686
00:36:03,485 --> 00:36:06,346
Ideally, we'd ship it off to Technicolor in India.

687
00:36:07,767 --> 00:36:08,968
you know, we're good.

688
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:12,591
So we decided we're going to try that.

689
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:13,912
Let's prepare for production.

690
00:36:14,072 --> 00:36:15,433
Let's see how we're going to do this all.

691
00:36:17,695 --> 00:36:19,597
So I'm going to first talk about the mixed idle,

692
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,178
so we all know what that means.

693
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:25,542
On the left, you'll see our regular full guard position.

694
00:36:26,182 --> 00:36:30,566
If the top man presses left on the stick, he gets this idle.

695
00:36:31,707 --> 00:36:34,249
Now if we go back to our default guard idle,

696
00:36:34,309 --> 00:36:36,591
if the bottom man presses left on his stick,

697
00:36:37,998 --> 00:36:42,121
we get sorry at the bottom model there in the middle and then if they both press left on the stick

698
00:36:43,963 --> 00:36:48,127
You'll see here in the full guard position the top man's right elbow

699
00:36:49,205 --> 00:36:53,149
You'll see here in his pose, he's digging into the bottom man's left leg.

700
00:36:53,810 --> 00:37:01,698
You'll see again in the far left picture, the bottom man's left wrist is now going for the arm drag.

701
00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:04,961
It's around the top man's left tricep.

702
00:37:05,501 --> 00:37:07,443
And in our mixed title, when they both press left of the stick,

703
00:37:08,204 --> 00:37:12,588
the top man's right elbow is digging into the bottom man's leg, while at the same time,

704
00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:16,713
the bottom man's left wrist hand is gripping the, whoops,

705
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:19,035
gripping the top man's tricep.

706
00:37:19,335 --> 00:37:21,838
Perfect, that's what we need.

707
00:37:21,858 --> 00:37:24,420
So, we now had to figure out what kind of data

708
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,501
was gonna come out of this tool,

709
00:37:25,641 --> 00:37:27,243
so we knew how to best prepare for that.

710
00:37:28,592 --> 00:37:31,033
We did like a vertical slice of the guard position.

711
00:37:31,053 --> 00:37:33,194
We kind of did some quick math out of that.

712
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:36,216
So we figured, based on the guard position,

713
00:37:36,256 --> 00:37:38,917
that 80% of our data would be easy to process.

714
00:37:39,817 --> 00:37:42,519
It would take about 1.5 man hours

715
00:37:42,619 --> 00:37:44,479
to clean up each little transition.

716
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:48,541
10% of the data would be difficult to process.

717
00:37:49,755 --> 00:37:53,537
Going back to the easy to process, that would also be great to send to our show of developments, easy for them.

718
00:37:54,457 --> 00:38:01,340
Difficult to process is 10%, that would be 3 man hours, and those would be awkward to explain to our show of developments.

719
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,182
We thought, let's just keep that in-house, it's a small number, it would be perfect to keep in-house.

720
00:38:06,203 --> 00:38:13,426
And then 10% would be, cannot process, we'll have to go through that whole motion capture process.

721
00:38:13,706 --> 00:38:17,468
And then once that's done, it would be about 4 hours for a person in the studio to clean it up.

722
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:23,313
So just an example of easy to process data.

723
00:38:24,514 --> 00:38:28,437
This was the kind of data we were getting for the most part from the tool.

724
00:38:29,218 --> 00:38:34,803
The bottom man's right arm is going through the top man's left arm

725
00:38:35,463 --> 00:38:38,827
and the bottom man's legs are crossing through each other.

726
00:38:39,407 --> 00:38:40,308
It's very linear.

727
00:38:41,649 --> 00:38:43,931
It's not bad, it's definitely something we can work with,

728
00:38:44,011 --> 00:38:45,192
but it's not perfect as you can see.

729
00:38:45,272 --> 00:38:47,735
So that's about 1.5 hours for a person to clean up.

730
00:38:50,198 --> 00:38:57,424
Difficult to process data, this is a bit trickier. It looks kind of simple at first, but the top man's right arm is going through the bottom man's left arm.

731
00:38:58,004 --> 00:39:03,489
So, we're going to have to explain to a person, you've got to bring that wrist all the way to his hip to pull it through.

732
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:08,653
We'll probably have to separate the two, the top man will have to push off a bit separating their bodies, and then we'll have to pin the legs.

733
00:39:09,414 --> 00:39:11,636
Rather than try to explain that, we'll keep it in-house, keep it simple.

734
00:39:14,205 --> 00:39:23,010
And then difficult to process data, as you can see, the top man is like teleporting across the mat, he's sliding, he has no weight, he's like he's on an ice rink.

735
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:29,394
We probably could spend some time cleaning that up, but why bother, let's keep our visual quality high, let's just go reshoot this.

736
00:39:33,196 --> 00:39:34,217
So moving into production.

737
00:39:35,938 --> 00:39:41,101
This is what our production was going to look like for all the types of data coming from this tool.

738
00:39:42,211 --> 00:39:43,652
We were going to lock down our name convention.

739
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:45,753
We were going to create our mixed titles.

740
00:39:47,393 --> 00:39:48,514
We'd press our export button.

741
00:39:49,914 --> 00:39:51,815
We would, you know, take all that data,

742
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:54,316
and we would estimate how long it would take to do it all.

743
00:39:54,697 --> 00:39:57,078
We'd make our docs and spreadsheets

744
00:39:57,138 --> 00:39:58,839
so we'd know where it was going to be at what time

745
00:39:59,479 --> 00:40:00,079
and what state.

746
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,502
We'd ideally ship off the ease-to-process data to India

747
00:40:05,662 --> 00:40:08,083
in nice packages from the cleanup.

748
00:40:08,183 --> 00:40:10,484
Difficult-to-process data we'd keep in-house to cleanup.

749
00:40:11,316 --> 00:40:13,177
and then that can not be processed data,

750
00:40:13,197 --> 00:40:15,678
we would just go and recapture in our capture studio.

751
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,500
And this is, here's an example of some of the naming

752
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,841
convention we had to work with.

753
00:40:21,901 --> 00:40:23,702
It's the longest name convention I've ever worked with.

754
00:40:24,562 --> 00:40:26,503
This one, it's clearly UFC2.

755
00:40:26,523 --> 00:40:28,844
The G means it's the ground.

756
00:40:29,304 --> 00:40:31,465
Trans means it's a transitional animation.

757
00:40:31,965 --> 00:40:34,526
The sub means it's the submissive, the bottom man,

758
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:36,027
who is initiating the transition.

759
00:40:36,547 --> 00:40:38,228
Back mount half guard means it's going

760
00:40:38,328 --> 00:40:39,849
from back mount to half guard.

761
00:40:41,049 --> 00:40:47,452
right means based off the top man, if his head is north and his groin is south, it's

762
00:40:47,492 --> 00:40:54,154
going counterclockwise. And Jeff can explain to you the last four parts of the name.

763
00:41:00,757 --> 00:41:03,898
Advanced right, none, none, those are kind of the states in the state machine.

764
00:41:03,958 --> 00:41:06,800
So the state in the state machine is defined by three things.

765
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:10,682
What grapple position you're in, what slot the top fighter is in,

766
00:41:10,722 --> 00:41:12,843
and what slot the bottom fighter is in.

767
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:15,204
That triplet defines a state in the state machine.

768
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:19,406
So those last four pieces are kind of giving all the information to know

769
00:41:20,446 --> 00:41:23,768
we're coming from submission down, advanced right,

770
00:41:23,888 --> 00:41:28,010
and going to trans-none, trans-none, from the back mount state to the half guard state.

771
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:31,931
And the important part here is that this does mean something to somebody

772
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:33,872
and it sees this search out and finds these assets,

773
00:41:34,053 --> 00:41:35,793
which is huge, this number of assets.

774
00:41:36,434 --> 00:41:37,514
So this was a big win for us.

775
00:41:39,195 --> 00:41:44,318
So, now, it was important to keep that difficult-to-process data

776
00:41:44,778 --> 00:41:46,639
down to a small number and I explain why.

777
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:52,462
We had 40 default poses, that's just your full guard, half guard,

778
00:41:52,482 --> 00:41:54,443
anybody who watches UFC, you know these positions.

779
00:41:56,485 --> 00:42:01,608
We had 122 neutral poses, these mixed idols, these ready idols.

780
00:42:02,589 --> 00:42:09,514
We had 261 submission poses from our grapple transition state going into our submission state.

781
00:42:10,455 --> 00:42:13,077
That's a total of 423 potential poses that you're going to have to...

782
00:42:17,596 --> 00:42:20,260
You know, you're writing out your shot list,

783
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,503
you're figuring out what goes where,

784
00:42:22,543 --> 00:42:23,644
you're doing a name convention.

785
00:42:24,365 --> 00:42:26,167
You have to make sure you have all these poses

786
00:42:26,187 --> 00:42:27,249
printed out to show your actors.

787
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:32,872
This is just a small example of some of the poses that the actor on the day has to match.

788
00:42:32,892 --> 00:42:35,953
The closer it matches, the easier it is for your internal development team to use.

789
00:42:36,933 --> 00:42:41,195
You then have to go and take that data and put it into a MoshBlur file and provide the

790
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:43,976
outsourcers with the exact start pose and end pose.

791
00:42:44,016 --> 00:42:47,437
It's just a huge nightmare, so to keep that number small was crucial.

792
00:42:50,878 --> 00:42:52,578
So the end result of working this way.

793
00:42:56,984 --> 00:43:01,024
UFC 1 had 600 two-player ground animations.

794
00:43:03,565 --> 00:43:08,386
UFC 2 had over 1,957 two-player ground animations.

795
00:43:10,986 --> 00:43:17,847
UFC 2's entire grappling system had 3,153 two-player animations.

796
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:22,648
Two or three of those were procedural, ran through Jeff's tool, and were untouched by an animator.

797
00:43:26,054 --> 00:43:29,556
437 were procedural animations exported and processed,

798
00:43:29,616 --> 00:43:30,697
meaning an animator touched them.

799
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:34,819
98, we could not,

800
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:39,562
it was data that was unusable from Jeff's tool,

801
00:43:39,602 --> 00:43:42,203
so we had to go and actually recapture those

802
00:43:42,283 --> 00:43:43,324
and clean them up the old school way.

803
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:48,707
And then, 1,317

804
00:43:50,688 --> 00:43:52,830
transitions we actually went and captured and cleaned up.

805
00:43:54,397 --> 00:43:56,599
in our capture lab. That's UFC 1 and UFC 2 combined.

806
00:43:56,739 --> 00:43:58,400
One point I want to make about this too is

807
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:02,022
even though in the end we ended up motion capturing a bunch

808
00:44:02,363 --> 00:44:03,343
and cleaning up a bunch,

809
00:44:03,804 --> 00:44:05,745
while we were in early production in pre-pro,

810
00:44:06,205 --> 00:44:09,507
we had a template for almost all the transitions in the game

811
00:44:09,547 --> 00:44:11,269
so we could actually prove out the design,

812
00:44:11,289 --> 00:44:13,510
we could convince people that this was worthwhile

813
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:14,671
from a gameplay standpoint.

814
00:44:15,171 --> 00:44:17,172
Even if the animations weren't perfect or beautiful,

815
00:44:17,192 --> 00:44:18,633
they were 100% functional

816
00:44:18,754 --> 00:44:21,115
and it gave us a template to work with all through production.

817
00:44:21,656 --> 00:44:26,740
If we hadn't had that early prototype, no way anyone would have signed off on this feature to begin with.

818
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,463
So the procedural aspect had huge benefits in pre-pro,

819
00:44:31,483 --> 00:44:35,307
even if those benefits started to dwindle as we got through production and everything got cleaned up.

820
00:44:35,647 --> 00:44:39,770
Yeah, it's true. It worked really early on, used the procedural data, which is huge.

821
00:44:43,252 --> 00:44:48,016
So 587 transitions we sent to TouchColor in UFC 2, which was a huge win for us.

822
00:44:49,537 --> 00:44:53,620
80 of those were of Jeff's tool. This number could have been much bigger.

823
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:02,967
I spent so much time managing my ex-dev group that I would have these small gaps in time where I could work on actual data.

824
00:45:03,707 --> 00:45:04,528
clean up processing.

825
00:45:04,548 --> 00:45:07,649
And so I like those animations because it would just be

826
00:45:07,709 --> 00:45:10,190
like an hour, hour and a half, and I would have to stop

827
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:12,230
halfway through and go back to managing, so I like that.

828
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:14,811
But this kind of data is perfect for your

829
00:45:14,831 --> 00:45:17,992
show development partners if you were to use that system.

830
00:45:20,393 --> 00:45:22,353
And so yeah, if we did this the old way,

831
00:45:22,614 --> 00:45:25,234
without Jeff's help, this would have taken

832
00:45:25,915 --> 00:45:28,055
essentially three animators in-house to do,

833
00:45:28,275 --> 00:45:29,616
and that just was not an option.

834
00:45:32,026 --> 00:45:47,029
So, just visual reference, if you compare the amount of data we created in UFC 1 to UFC 2, UFC 1 being the blue, UFC 2 being the red, you can see it's like over three times the amount with the aid of Jeff's tool.

835
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:52,952
And just here it's a breakdown of the type of data we ended up having so on left

836
00:45:53,012 --> 00:45:59,033
It's our motion capture and then the two smaller pieces is the data from Jeff's tool, and you can see the amount

837
00:46:00,514 --> 00:46:01,734
the top wedge is

838
00:46:02,975 --> 00:46:07,456
Procedurally edited and then we touched it the bottom wedge is untouched by Jeff's tool, which is amazing

839
00:46:09,583 --> 00:46:13,986
And then of the data Jeff's tool produced, you can see on the left, that's the amount

840
00:46:14,026 --> 00:46:18,850
touched by an animator, and then on the far right, untouched, and then that top wedge

841
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:21,712
is the amount we couldn't use and we had to go and capture.

842
00:46:24,135 --> 00:46:28,518
So, in conclusion, I think UFC 2 was a success

843
00:46:28,638 --> 00:46:31,060
because of our organizational protocols,

844
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:35,583
all that docking, knowing what asset was where in the world

845
00:46:35,623 --> 00:46:37,244
and what state, we had to know that all the time,

846
00:46:38,065 --> 00:46:39,245
and what state it was in the game.

847
00:46:39,565 --> 00:46:41,687
Often we just put in raw MoCAP data for Jeff to use

848
00:46:41,707 --> 00:46:42,507
so he could get it all set up,

849
00:46:42,988 --> 00:46:44,609
and then we'd know when it was old,

850
00:46:44,669 --> 00:46:45,709
and then when it came from India,

851
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:47,591
we'd know when we replaced it with new data.

852
00:46:49,392 --> 00:46:50,753
And the convention, if I didn't mention that already.

853
00:46:52,093 --> 00:46:55,814
And then at Erck's Drill Development was a big part of why we got this done.

854
00:46:56,354 --> 00:46:59,815
And then one of the biggest pieces was Jeff's tool, for sure.

855
00:47:00,035 --> 00:47:01,195
It was a massive win.

856
00:47:01,955 --> 00:47:05,236
And we ended up with our 8 out of 10, last time I checked.

857
00:47:06,076 --> 00:47:07,917
Which is very happy.

858
00:47:08,017 --> 00:47:08,797
It might have gone up.

859
00:47:09,177 --> 00:47:11,297
Might have gone up. It's 81 now, let's just say that.

860
00:47:12,698 --> 00:47:17,239
And so, in conclusion, a lot of you, I'm assuming, watch House of Cards.

861
00:47:19,441 --> 00:47:23,924
There is a scene in House of Cards where there's all these monks in the White House,

862
00:47:24,265 --> 00:47:30,449
and they're sitting over this table, and it looks like they're kind of grating chalk onto a table,

863
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:35,974
creating this pattern. It looks like painstaking work. It looks monotonous and tedious,

864
00:47:36,454 --> 00:47:42,018
and it looks long and hard. When Jeff came to me and showed me the early prototype,

865
00:47:42,478 --> 00:47:47,742
and I kind of understood what it would take, I knew it wouldn't be sexy work like Overwatch.

866
00:47:49,966 --> 00:47:52,570
But I believed so much in the result.

867
00:47:53,452 --> 00:47:55,515
And as you see the result of this,

868
00:47:56,456 --> 00:48:00,142
you know, the monk's work, this beautiful, inspiring pattern

869
00:48:00,202 --> 00:48:02,145
that is pretty mind-blowing.

870
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,509
And I just saw the bigger picture of the tunnel like this.

871
00:48:05,713 --> 00:48:11,075
Working with all these little pieces and doing this tracking documents and working with XDev is not sexy work,

872
00:48:11,195 --> 00:48:13,675
but I had the big picture in mind and I was super excited.

873
00:48:13,895 --> 00:48:15,936
I love the sport of martial arts, I love grappling.

874
00:48:17,256 --> 00:48:22,978
And I was like, what if we could actually make the first legit grappling feature in a game?

875
00:48:23,638 --> 00:48:27,879
And so that's what, you know, that's why I went through all the hard work was for that end result.

876
00:48:27,899 --> 00:48:31,360
I was so excited to see it. And here's an example of all that hard work.

877
00:48:33,115 --> 00:48:44,441
Good shot. Huge bump from the top. Big punches landing.

878
00:48:46,402 --> 00:48:47,422
Powerful right hand.

879
00:48:52,405 --> 00:48:55,326
Great position. He's got him mounted here.

880
00:48:55,346 --> 00:48:56,506
Maya, court for a submission.

881
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:04,073
He's got that armbar wood off right here.

882
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:09,255
And he gets out of it. Deep armbar. Beautiful escape.

883
00:49:09,275 --> 00:49:11,016
Oh, big diving punch to the head.

884
00:49:13,477 --> 00:49:15,719
Maia's right eye is looking pretty swollen.

885
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:22,002
He's doing a great job of moving and transitioning here on the ground.

886
00:49:25,744 --> 00:49:27,104
Good elbow to the head by Meghni.

887
00:49:29,446 --> 00:49:31,066
Meghni's inside control again here.

888
00:49:34,165 --> 00:49:36,886
So that's literally thousands of animations.

889
00:49:37,626 --> 00:49:39,227
And from here, I'm going to hand it back to Jeff.

890
00:49:40,348 --> 00:49:42,509
So I want to go through a few of the learnings

891
00:49:42,549 --> 00:49:44,029
that I took away from this project.

892
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:46,330
So we're in pre-pro.

893
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:49,252
We've got this seemingly insurmountable problem,

894
00:49:49,752 --> 00:49:51,793
unless we can come up with a procedural solution.

895
00:49:51,853 --> 00:49:53,034
And procedural is sexy.

896
00:49:53,074 --> 00:49:55,335
I could probably do a GDC talk on this awesome procedural

897
00:49:55,355 --> 00:49:55,755
solution.

898
00:49:55,775 --> 00:49:58,396
I really want this feature to work.

899
00:49:58,416 --> 00:49:59,396
We've got to find a way to do it.

900
00:50:00,511 --> 00:50:01,912
So I start on the procedural solution.

901
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:03,393
I'm starting to get these mixed results.

902
00:50:03,474 --> 00:50:05,695
And it's like, eh, I don't know if this is going to work.

903
00:50:06,356 --> 00:50:08,458
There was a decision point there where

904
00:50:08,498 --> 00:50:11,480
I could double down on making it 100% procedural

905
00:50:11,741 --> 00:50:13,302
and trying to introduce our physics

906
00:50:13,382 --> 00:50:16,385
engine into this offline animation generation process.

907
00:50:16,405 --> 00:50:18,126
So some of those clipping issues would go away.

908
00:50:18,186 --> 00:50:19,627
But that might introduce more problems.

909
00:50:20,808 --> 00:50:22,790
I could maybe try to add more intelligence

910
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:26,373
in the auto-matching algorithm to try and get better results.

911
00:50:27,828 --> 00:50:30,609
But don't lose sight of the forest for the trees.

912
00:50:31,009 --> 00:50:33,970
The goal was actually to ship this feature

913
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:36,670
and figure out how to make this much content.

914
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:39,591
So put the cool technology to the side

915
00:50:39,771 --> 00:50:41,011
and focus on workflows.

916
00:50:41,411 --> 00:50:43,772
Focus on tightening up the export process.

917
00:50:43,812 --> 00:50:45,872
Make everything as quick and as fast as possible.

918
00:50:46,612 --> 00:50:48,833
And figure out a way to work with the animators

919
00:50:48,873 --> 00:50:49,873
to get to the end result.

920
00:50:50,753 --> 00:50:51,253
That was a big one.

921
00:50:53,609 --> 00:51:16,723
Another one, so game industry has kind of matured a little bit over the years, animation has matured, kind of falling behind, or trailing behind a little bit, but we've got a bunch of mature tools, most engines have like some pretty good generic state machine technology, animation blending technology, all that kind of stuff. So we've got some really good general purpose tools.

922
00:51:18,201 --> 00:51:25,550
But when we scaled up to this volume of content, those generalized tools just weren't going to cut it.

923
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:31,516
So there's a tipping point somewhere where the number of assets that you need to create inside of a system...

924
00:51:33,539 --> 00:51:35,640
It's not worth using those general purpose tools.

925
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:38,602
You have to build something very specific to the problem at hand

926
00:51:38,982 --> 00:51:42,344
so that you can extract every tiny little bit of efficiency

927
00:51:42,524 --> 00:51:47,267
out of that process because it's going to just explode in volume

928
00:51:47,587 --> 00:51:48,668
and every little bit counts.

929
00:51:49,769 --> 00:51:53,193
So we spent a lot of time, we wrote a custom state machine for this.

930
00:51:54,134 --> 00:51:59,520
I manually entered all 4,000 nodes in that state machine, but it contained all the metadata

931
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:02,564
that was needed in order to understand where it fit in its place.

932
00:52:02,644 --> 00:52:05,467
We could write a bunch of automation tools off of that state machine.

933
00:52:06,048 --> 00:52:10,350
All of the procedural transitions and animations were built off of that base state machine layer.

934
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:12,331
So everything kind of came from one central hub.

935
00:52:13,071 --> 00:52:19,994
And the workflows for authoring that state machine were 100% designed just for what I had to do with that state machine.

936
00:52:20,114 --> 00:52:23,735
And if we hadn't done it that way, there's absolutely no way we would have had time to do this.

937
00:52:23,815 --> 00:52:25,516
It was a massive, massive undertaking.

938
00:52:25,936 --> 00:52:30,518
And that initial authoring of the state machine could not be automated in any way because...

939
00:52:32,059 --> 00:52:35,222
It had to follow the real-life sport of mixed martial arts.

940
00:52:35,643 --> 00:52:40,006
It wasn't a homogenous system that translated across all grapple positions.

941
00:52:40,127 --> 00:52:45,431
Every position had a unique flavor and difference based on what arm was grabbing what, what

942
00:52:45,491 --> 00:52:48,674
could you do while another guy was doing a thing, and it took a lot of knowledge of the

943
00:52:48,714 --> 00:52:52,258
sport and custom tools in order to put something together that complex.

944
00:52:55,426 --> 00:52:58,649
And this was a big one, and this is what I wanted in my original title, but we cut it out.

945
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:01,913
To quote Nate Diaz, don't be scared, homie.

946
00:53:03,115 --> 00:53:06,438
We were facing something that seemed insurmountable.

947
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:09,742
This is probably going to be really bad advice to give to you,

948
00:53:10,303 --> 00:53:12,225
but I'm going to do it anyway because it might be inspirational,

949
00:53:12,385 --> 00:53:14,188
or it might tank your next project, I don't know.

950
00:53:16,895 --> 00:53:20,659
We, we're, you're kind of looking at this massive amount of stuff that you have to do

951
00:53:20,779 --> 00:53:24,322
and huge unknowns and you've got management asking you to come up with estimates

952
00:53:25,183 --> 00:53:28,026
and then you've got to break that down into who's going to do what

953
00:53:28,807 --> 00:53:30,709
and honestly like there's a point where

954
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:32,390
I don't know the answer.

955
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:34,431
Like, I cannot estimate how long this is going to take.

956
00:53:34,851 --> 00:53:35,571
I have no clue.

957
00:53:36,271 --> 00:53:39,132
So I get to choose, are we taking this risk or not?

958
00:53:39,192 --> 00:53:41,473
Because people are trusting my judgment

959
00:53:41,493 --> 00:53:42,734
to decide whether we go forward.

960
00:53:43,154 --> 00:53:45,274
If I was conservative, I would have said, no, we can't do this,

961
00:53:45,415 --> 00:53:46,495
because there's too many unknowns.

962
00:53:47,075 --> 00:53:49,216
But Jeremy and I were super excited about doing this.

963
00:53:49,236 --> 00:53:50,076
It was like, ah, fuck it.

964
00:53:50,116 --> 00:53:50,576
Let's do it.

965
00:53:51,517 --> 00:53:52,478
Right or die.

966
00:53:53,098 --> 00:53:54,800
So yeah, just don't be scared.

967
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:57,402
If you're really passionate and you make solid contingency

968
00:53:57,422 --> 00:54:00,805
plans and you know you have decision points

969
00:54:00,865 --> 00:54:04,208
in the production cycle where you can take a left turn

970
00:54:04,248 --> 00:54:06,150
or a right turn if things don't work out the way you want,

971
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:07,151
just go for it.

972
00:54:07,191 --> 00:54:08,892
You're working with a team of really smart people

973
00:54:08,933 --> 00:54:11,655
and you'll be able to pivot when you need to.

974
00:54:11,975 --> 00:54:13,156
So yeah, just don't be scared.

975
00:54:13,196 --> 00:54:13,697
Take risks.

976
00:54:14,137 --> 00:54:15,558
Awesome things can come with it.

977
00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:16,960
Probably bad things can come too,

978
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:17,841
but I'm not going to talk about that.

979
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:23,279
And that's it. We've got a few minutes for questions if anyone has any.

980
00:54:32,661 --> 00:54:33,121
Applause

981
00:54:33,541 --> 00:54:40,442
Hello, I'm John Butterfield. I have a question. If you ever went back and edited any of your mix idols,

982
00:54:41,622 --> 00:54:48,143
excuse me, like so that if your start and end poses changed, how did you realign those throughout the process?

983
00:54:48,388 --> 00:54:50,389
So there's two pieces to that, probably

984
00:54:50,429 --> 00:54:51,310
what Jeremy's going to say.

985
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:53,291
But at the beginning, there was a lot

986
00:54:53,311 --> 00:54:54,592
of editing of those mixed titles.

987
00:54:54,652 --> 00:54:57,654
So we would try and keep things procedural for as long

988
00:54:57,674 --> 00:55:00,155
as possible to kind of work out all the details

989
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:01,336
with those mixed title poses.

990
00:55:02,017 --> 00:55:04,618
If we were to bake something out and have it tweaked,

991
00:55:05,059 --> 00:55:06,400
all of that procedural information

992
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:09,021
was still stored in the data library.

993
00:55:09,081 --> 00:55:11,103
So we could always flip back to the procedural one,

994
00:55:11,463 --> 00:55:13,344
regenerate it, and then do the cleanup again.

995
00:55:13,484 --> 00:55:14,525
So that's my answer.

996
00:55:14,805 --> 00:55:16,226
That's pretty much my answer.

997
00:55:16,266 --> 00:55:17,227
There were times where.

998
00:55:18,327 --> 00:55:20,748
If it was a small change, I'd just go into the edited data

999
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:23,489
and just slap the pose on and polish it further.

1000
00:55:24,089 --> 00:55:26,450
But sometimes you just regenerate it a bunch.

1001
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:28,931
It was kind of grunt work at that point.

1002
00:55:29,011 --> 00:55:32,152
The bigger problem was with if any of the transitions that

1003
00:55:32,172 --> 00:55:34,532
were used as a base for the procedural generation

1004
00:55:34,672 --> 00:55:35,573
changed timings.

1005
00:55:35,973 --> 00:55:37,773
That was a much bigger challenge,

1006
00:55:37,833 --> 00:55:39,094
because when we

1007
00:55:40,234 --> 00:55:41,735
auto-generated these transitions,

1008
00:55:41,795 --> 00:55:43,616
they would reuse all the tagging information

1009
00:55:43,696 --> 00:55:44,377
from the animation.

1010
00:55:44,417 --> 00:55:46,538
They would reuse all the relative IK information

1011
00:55:46,618 --> 00:55:47,279
from the original.

1012
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:49,320
So no one had to manage or maintain

1013
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:52,202
any of that tagging or curves or anything like that.

1014
00:55:52,622 --> 00:55:54,303
As soon as you bake it out, it basically

1015
00:55:54,323 --> 00:55:57,065
becomes its own entity where any changes to the timing,

1016
00:55:57,866 --> 00:55:59,246
all those tags have to be updated.

1017
00:56:00,968 --> 00:56:02,829
We also had some problems with some of the auto curves

1018
00:56:02,869 --> 00:56:05,651
have to be regenerated if the base animation changed length

1019
00:56:05,691 --> 00:56:06,391
and stuff like that.

1020
00:56:06,411 --> 00:56:08,573
So that's a tricky thing to manage for sure.

1021
00:56:09,453 --> 00:56:09,913
OK, thank you.

1022
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:13,677
Hi.

1023
00:56:13,877 --> 00:56:15,978
Jeremy, when you first saw the procedural system,

1024
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:17,799
you said something along the lines of, well,

1025
00:56:17,819 --> 00:56:19,460
our mocap isn't that great anyway.

1026
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,341
Could you just elaborate on some of the problems

1027
00:56:21,361 --> 00:56:23,822
your mocap sees where this procedural solution looked

1028
00:56:23,842 --> 00:56:24,542
like a better way to go?

1029
00:56:25,624 --> 00:56:29,987
Um, I wouldn't know, like it wasn't like it was better because the data was good or bad.

1030
00:56:30,447 --> 00:56:37,292
It was when you go into the motion capture studio and you get these actors posing themselves on the ground

1031
00:56:38,013 --> 00:56:42,716
um and real weight and the difference in their bodies, they just have challenges sometimes

1032
00:56:42,776 --> 00:56:47,740
matching those poses. Or we had the problem with UFC 1, we were kind of a bunch of white belts

1033
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:52,623
making jiu-jitsu and we kind of had some bad poses and we had these black belts coming in with better poses.

1034
00:56:53,324 --> 00:56:55,324
and their hips would be more on the side,

1035
00:56:55,684 --> 00:56:58,485
they'd be using more of a deep half kind of position,

1036
00:56:59,345 --> 00:57:01,486
and then we'd send that data off to India,

1037
00:57:01,806 --> 00:57:04,326
and they're like, hey, these poses don't match your old poses,

1038
00:57:04,766 --> 00:57:06,967
and you're making our work quite a lot harder for us.

1039
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:10,068
So with having Jeff's tool, that was the biggest part of it,

1040
00:57:10,088 --> 00:57:11,568
was just baking out those poses.

1041
00:57:11,888 --> 00:57:14,249
And then when I take that data and I package it up and send it to India,

1042
00:57:14,769 --> 00:57:16,970
I don't have to tell them to do anything, just clean up the middle.

1043
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:20,732
Whereas when I send them the motion capture data, I'd have to go and find those poses

1044
00:57:21,072 --> 00:57:25,394
and in each package, each transition, I'd have to give them each start and end pose

1045
00:57:25,414 --> 00:57:27,635
just to make sure, you want to make things as simple as possible.

1046
00:57:27,975 --> 00:57:31,376
And there is a lot of front-end work on that, and to get rid of that front-end work is huge.

1047
00:57:31,712 --> 00:57:37,578
Yeah, I don't know that people will really appreciate how complex a state machine with those 4,000 transitions is.

1048
00:57:38,379 --> 00:57:41,983
When you go into mocap and, like, you got your 8-day mocap shoot,

1049
00:57:42,444 --> 00:57:46,589
and you're aggressively trying to capture, like, 250 moves because we need these moves,

1050
00:57:46,649 --> 00:57:49,572
otherwise there's all these massive holes in the state machine.

1051
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:53,674
You're going to be on top of every single animation

1052
00:57:53,714 --> 00:57:54,974
that you're trying to capture because you've

1053
00:57:54,994 --> 00:57:55,775
got to do it quickly.

1054
00:57:56,375 --> 00:57:57,956
And someone has to have all that in their head

1055
00:57:57,976 --> 00:57:58,736
because you look at this.

1056
00:57:59,076 --> 00:58:02,397
I need up transition from half guard

1057
00:58:02,818 --> 00:58:04,338
while this guy's pressing left and this guy.

1058
00:58:04,418 --> 00:58:06,339
Like, figuring out what all that even means,

1059
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:07,780
let alone digging up the poses.

1060
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:08,940
It's a lot of overhead.

1061
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:13,885
Jeff often directed those shoots because he knew the system more than I did and I was like you got to do this because I don't

1062
00:58:14,265 --> 00:58:18,389
I was the only person who had everything in my head because I authored the state machine and

1063
00:58:18,889 --> 00:58:23,093
It wasn't until way later in the project that like our QA guy was up to speed and understood it

1064
00:58:23,133 --> 00:58:25,775
Jeremy was up to speed and understood it. It was extremely complex

1065
00:58:26,476 --> 00:58:31,200
And to the animation data, like you guys were saying that the hand poses you get back from mocap aren't good,

1066
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:35,763
but if like the hand is just resting on the shoulder and then it shifts a little bit,

1067
00:58:36,043 --> 00:58:41,007
that's better than having like a hand that has no posing on it and is kind of floating and bouncing and stuff.

1068
00:58:41,047 --> 00:58:44,190
So there are some efficiencies there that you don't get from mocap.

1069
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:50,915
And just, you know, the usual issue with mocap, some jittering, some knock knees, some weirdness going through the ground.

1070
00:58:52,181 --> 00:58:55,424
Yeah, I think that's... it's mostly saved, but I've forgotten now.

1071
00:58:56,144 --> 00:58:56,965
Thank you guys so much.

1072
00:58:57,285 --> 00:58:57,505
Thanks.

1073
00:58:57,525 --> 00:59:02,109
Hey, so you've got a huge combination of animations and various character sizes.

1074
00:59:02,189 --> 00:59:06,893
Do you have any strategy for how you would test that everything was working with all your different characters?

1075
00:59:06,933 --> 00:59:07,994
Yeah, it's really hard to do.

1076
00:59:09,195 --> 00:59:12,478
We would always test... well, I thought we always did, but apparently we didn't...

1077
00:59:12,638 --> 00:59:16,882
the tallest versus shortest, fat versus fat.

1078
00:59:18,022 --> 00:59:20,924
Tall and fat versus short and skinny.

1079
00:59:21,645 --> 00:59:23,105
Short and fat versus tall and skinny.

1080
00:59:23,205 --> 00:59:24,186
And then always men and women.

1081
00:59:24,866 --> 00:59:31,830
Because there were differences with the female rig that caused issues like breasts and stuff like that.

1082
00:59:31,870 --> 00:59:34,872
Like colliding, causing collusion, geometry to push you out in different ways.

1083
00:59:34,892 --> 00:59:36,833
So we had to deal with some of that stuff too.

1084
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:40,575
But there's no way to test every combination. It's just impossible.

1085
00:59:40,675 --> 00:59:45,138
So just pick your extremes and like one middle of the road and hope for the best.

1086
00:59:45,158 --> 00:59:47,259
It was a little manual, but did you have anything automated?

1087
00:59:47,399 --> 00:59:49,881
We didn't have any automated testing on that kind of stuff.

1088
00:59:50,041 --> 00:59:52,023
The other thing I really wish we had time to do,

1089
00:59:52,323 --> 00:59:55,245
but we didn't, was write an automated script

1090
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:57,126
to walk the state machine, basically,

1091
00:59:57,186 --> 01:00:00,489
so that a QA guy could just sit there and watch it

1092
01:00:00,569 --> 01:00:03,451
do everything, and then pick up on any problems

1093
01:00:03,491 --> 01:00:03,971
and flag them.

1094
01:00:04,952 --> 01:00:09,773
We ended up having like this master tracking document that was generated from the state machine

1095
01:00:11,154 --> 01:00:13,935
That would have like a unique good for every transition

1096
01:00:14,095 --> 01:00:19,857
And then one of our QA guys wrote a script that would pull telemetry from the game and like flag them as

1097
01:00:20,537 --> 01:00:23,478
This has been played this hasn't been played so when QA was doing testing

1098
01:00:23,518 --> 01:00:29,441
They could like flush that database and then retest and figure out hey, no one's played this particular transition yet

1099
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:30,101
That's a problem

1100
01:00:30,801 --> 01:00:33,303
someone has to trigger that to know that it's functioning properly.

1101
01:00:33,764 --> 01:00:37,366
But testing the system was a ridiculous undertaking, too.

1102
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,488
Every time something in the game changes,

1103
01:00:39,528 --> 01:00:41,470
you're supposed to do a full smoke of the system,

1104
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:44,372
and this was just too large and complex to actually do manually.

1105
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:48,055
So writing a lot of Automotion tools, we could have done a lot more,

1106
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:50,056
but very, very difficult to test.

1107
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:53,540
And as far as the animations testing,

1108
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,661
there's a little trick that happens on pretty much every UFC

1109
01:00:56,781 --> 01:00:57,241
MMA title.

1110
01:00:57,681 --> 01:00:59,222
When the characters are in the takedown

1111
01:00:59,762 --> 01:01:03,103
and they take to the ground, if they scale at least bone length

1112
01:01:03,203 --> 01:01:05,923
one to one, the girth stays the same.

1113
01:01:06,003 --> 01:01:08,224
So if you're Mark Hunt versus Strube, Mark Hunt's still fat,

1114
01:01:08,244 --> 01:01:09,464
Strube is still skinny.

1115
01:01:09,684 --> 01:01:11,024
But they're both essentially the same height,

1116
01:01:11,064 --> 01:01:13,965
and that kind of takes care of a lot of that problem.

1117
01:01:14,065 --> 01:01:15,445
I think we're out of time now.

1118
01:01:16,045 --> 01:01:18,026
Jeremy and I will stick around up here at the front

1119
01:01:18,106 --> 01:01:19,286
if anyone wants to ask questions.

1120
01:01:19,546 --> 01:01:20,527
Thanks, everyone, for coming.

1121
01:01:20,787 --> 01:01:21,077
Thank you.
