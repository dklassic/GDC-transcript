1
00:00:06,167 --> 00:00:09,128
I'm Tom, I was the writer, designer and programmer

2
00:00:09,288 --> 00:00:11,029
on a game called Gunpoint that came out in 2013

3
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:13,670
and on Heat Signature which came out just last year.

4
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,252
And when I started Gunpoint, I said this publicly,

5
00:00:18,272 --> 00:00:20,073
I'll be surprised if it takes me less than six months

6
00:00:20,173 --> 00:00:21,594
and sad if it takes me more than a year.

7
00:00:23,455 --> 00:00:24,355
Gunpoint took three years.

8
00:00:26,116 --> 00:00:27,917
When I started Heat Signature, having learned nothing,

9
00:00:28,357 --> 00:00:31,079
I said publicly again, I'm just taking a break

10
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:33,120
from learning Unity to make something quick in Game Maker.

11
00:00:34,763 --> 00:00:36,104
Heat signature took three and a half years.

12
00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:42,189
So clearly, both of these games have scope creep.

13
00:00:42,849 --> 00:00:45,191
They both deviated wildly from their original plans.

14
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:47,213
And scope creep is a dirty word.

15
00:00:47,253 --> 00:00:47,853
It's a bad thing.

16
00:00:47,873 --> 00:00:48,533
We're supposed to avoid it.

17
00:00:48,553 --> 00:00:51,616
Unfortunately, it's also kind of my development process.

18
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,312
I have never really stuck to any plans, and I'm mocking my past self for being so wildly

19
00:00:58,332 --> 00:01:02,835
wrong about time estimates, but if I'd stuck to my plan on either of those games, I just

20
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:03,835
wouldn't be here at all.

21
00:01:03,895 --> 00:01:07,557
I would just be someone with a slightly boring hobby project that never really went anywhere,

22
00:01:08,358 --> 00:01:09,718
and I probably would have given up before the next one.

23
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:14,381
So all the good stuff in those games came from the stuff that I made up along the way

24
00:01:14,781 --> 00:01:16,082
that deviated from the original plan.

25
00:01:16,102 --> 00:01:17,222
So there's something good here.

26
00:01:19,504 --> 00:01:21,805
But the warnings about ScopeCreep are not misplaced.

27
00:01:21,825 --> 00:01:23,927
There are definitely dangers as well.

28
00:01:24,747 --> 00:01:28,910
So I feel like I definitely screwed up something here.

29
00:01:29,111 --> 00:01:29,851
Probably two things.

30
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:34,614
One of them would be just when estimating the time that my own games are going to take me.

31
00:01:35,135 --> 00:01:40,380
I think on that topic I've proved the world's least qualified person, and I'm not just wrong

32
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,164
about it, I'm extremely wrong, I'm consistently wrong, and I'm also the only one who's wrong

33
00:01:45,204 --> 00:01:45,584
about this.

34
00:01:46,605 --> 00:01:48,347
No one else thought gunpoint was going to take six months.

35
00:01:48,727 --> 00:01:50,089
No one told me heat signature would be quick.

36
00:01:50,589 --> 00:01:55,774
I'm incredibly bad at this, and like a lot of unqualified people who have never been

37
00:01:55,794 --> 00:01:58,136
in the vicinity of being right, a lot of people listen to me.

38
00:01:58,737 --> 00:02:00,558
And so I'm just going to have to shut myself up about that.

39
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,542
So this is my excuse for not sticking to my plans.

40
00:02:06,642 --> 00:02:07,983
Until you make something, you don't know anything.

41
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:10,765
I find I never have any idea if anything's gonna work out

42
00:02:10,825 --> 00:02:12,086
until I've actually made it.

43
00:02:12,547 --> 00:02:15,369
So the whole process is about prototyping

44
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:17,190
whatever idea it is you have,

45
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,952
and prototyping enough of it to know whether it works.

46
00:02:19,912 --> 00:02:24,497
And that process has gone right for me once

47
00:02:24,797 --> 00:02:26,018
and kind of wrong for me once.

48
00:02:26,059 --> 00:02:27,180
Because the other thing I screwed up is that

49
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,001
heat signature taking three and a half years

50
00:02:29,622 --> 00:02:31,424
is a lot worse than gunpoint taking three years

51
00:02:31,564 --> 00:02:33,666
because gunpoint was three years of weekends,

52
00:02:33,766 --> 00:02:35,288
heat signature was three and a half years of full time.

53
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:40,933
So at some point, this got really, really inefficient.

54
00:02:41,994 --> 00:02:42,975
And so I want to look into...

55
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:48,381
what went right on Gunpoint and what went wrong on Heat Signature and how I could improve

56
00:02:48,421 --> 00:02:53,625
the process to try and hopefully err on the side of the faster development process.

57
00:02:55,286 --> 00:02:57,208
So this is Gunpoint when I started making it.

58
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:06,415
I actually, before this point, I had a plan about being a robot in space dropping fridges

59
00:03:06,455 --> 00:03:06,756
on people.

60
00:03:09,163 --> 00:03:10,444
And I'm not saying that wouldn't have worked,

61
00:03:10,544 --> 00:03:12,164
but it isn't the direction I ended up going in.

62
00:03:13,365 --> 00:03:15,405
By the time I actually started to learn Game Maker

63
00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:16,886
and mess around with the prototype,

64
00:03:17,066 --> 00:03:19,287
I was pretty set on you being some kind of private detective

65
00:03:20,527 --> 00:03:22,208
and I also wanted you to be able to click

66
00:03:22,628 --> 00:03:24,568
and fling towards wherever you clicked on the screen,

67
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:26,349
which has nothing to do with being a private detective,

68
00:03:26,649 --> 00:03:28,030
but I just did both and here we are.

69
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,952
The only other plan I had really was that I really liked Deus Ex and I wanted to see

70
00:03:34,012 --> 00:03:38,234
how many things that I liked about Deus Ex I could capture in a 2D game.

71
00:03:39,114 --> 00:03:43,776
One of which is being killed on sight, and another of which is if you do get a jump on

72
00:03:43,816 --> 00:03:44,957
someone you can take them out pretty easily.

73
00:03:46,795 --> 00:03:47,635
And then I was thinking about, you know,

74
00:03:48,015 --> 00:03:49,716
locked doors, figuring out ways past them,

75
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,257
security cameras, all that kind of thing

76
00:03:51,277 --> 00:03:53,538
about infiltrating a building,

77
00:03:54,358 --> 00:03:55,619
figuring out ways past security.

78
00:03:56,419 --> 00:03:58,320
And how many of those could I do in 2D

79
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,961
and how well would they work?

80
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:03,363
And one of those things is hacking.

81
00:04:04,163 --> 00:04:06,184
And I love hacking in these games.

82
00:04:06,224 --> 00:04:08,285
I love the feeling of subverting the level

83
00:04:08,345 --> 00:04:09,486
to work the way you want it to,

84
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:11,107
taking things that are supposed to work against you

85
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:12,027
and making them work for you.

86
00:04:12,547 --> 00:04:13,508
And so I was thinking about

87
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:16,921
ways to do that and thinking back to

88
00:04:18,163 --> 00:04:21,388
when I used to design levels for like Duke Nukem 3D and Quake

89
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,211
in those games you would.

90
00:04:24,822 --> 00:04:27,242
First, place like a door or a switch,

91
00:04:27,662 --> 00:04:28,543
and then after you place them,

92
00:04:28,623 --> 00:04:29,703
figure out how they're wired up,

93
00:04:29,783 --> 00:04:30,963
like which thing is connected to what,

94
00:04:31,023 --> 00:04:32,244
what switch activates what doors,

95
00:04:32,724 --> 00:04:33,904
and you have a load of freedom when you do that,

96
00:04:33,944 --> 00:04:35,304
and it's a fun process.

97
00:04:35,845 --> 00:04:39,105
So my idea was maybe you could give the player that freedom

98
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:40,506
and let them kind of just switch to a mode

99
00:04:40,526 --> 00:04:41,746
where they see how everything is wired up,

100
00:04:42,386 --> 00:04:44,707
and they can just drag those connections around

101
00:04:44,727 --> 00:04:45,427
to work however they want.

102
00:04:45,447 --> 00:04:47,048
So they can drag a light switch to a door,

103
00:04:47,108 --> 00:04:48,608
and now pressing the light switch opens the door

104
00:04:48,628 --> 00:04:49,488
instead of turning the light off.

105
00:04:51,297 --> 00:04:54,419
And I tried that and it was really fun.

106
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,241
I immediately had loads of cool ideas

107
00:04:57,281 --> 00:04:57,901
to mess around with it.

108
00:04:58,922 --> 00:05:01,023
I sent it to testers, testers really enjoy playing with it.

109
00:05:01,543 --> 00:05:03,285
In its most basic form, it's obviously too powerful

110
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:04,605
because you can just hook one light switch

111
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:05,466
to every light in the building

112
00:05:05,486 --> 00:05:07,327
and then make the whole building go dark

113
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:08,708
and sneak through it.

114
00:05:09,228 --> 00:05:12,230
But it was obvious how to fix that problem.

115
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,411
It was obvious that you should have some things

116
00:05:14,431 --> 00:05:15,512
that you can't rewire at first.

117
00:05:16,753 --> 00:05:18,854
So there's the things are here on a protected circuit

118
00:05:18,894 --> 00:05:20,235
and once I get to the circuit box,

119
00:05:20,395 --> 00:05:20,755
I can then.

120
00:05:21,186 --> 00:05:23,566
hack into those as well and rewire everything.

121
00:05:24,647 --> 00:05:28,808
And it just immediately became obvious

122
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:29,708
that this should be a puzzle game.

123
00:05:29,848 --> 00:05:31,428
Like that was just a puzzle mechanic.

124
00:05:32,648 --> 00:05:34,909
The ability to rewire things was a really powerful tool.

125
00:05:35,609 --> 00:05:36,869
Restricting that in an interesting way

126
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,310
was felt like a sort of puzzly obstacle.

127
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,211
And it was just very intuitive

128
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:44,991
to just build levels around that concept.

129
00:05:45,031 --> 00:05:45,731
You can't do this.

130
00:05:46,991 --> 00:05:48,272
There's some reason you can't use the crosslink

131
00:05:48,292 --> 00:05:48,972
to solve this problem.

132
00:05:49,372 --> 00:05:50,692
Figure out an interesting way around that.

133
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,732
And so Gunpoint just kind of told me what I wanted to be.

134
00:05:53,752 --> 00:05:55,514
It just wanted to be a puzzle game, just obviously.

135
00:05:57,195 --> 00:05:59,097
And I just rolled with that,

136
00:05:59,137 --> 00:06:03,261
and I just expanded the hacking mechanic to a crazy extent.

137
00:06:03,301 --> 00:06:04,242
I built the whole game around it,

138
00:06:05,182 --> 00:06:06,183
which was definitely scope creep,

139
00:06:06,203 --> 00:06:07,665
because I wasn't sacrificing anything.

140
00:06:07,685 --> 00:06:10,047
I didn't have some sophisticated combat system

141
00:06:10,087 --> 00:06:11,088
that I then canceled

142
00:06:11,128 --> 00:06:12,629
because I was going so deep on the hacking thing.

143
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,271
I just went deep on the hacking thing

144
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:15,872
in addition to all the other stuff I'd already done.

145
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,151
And I think it was good scope creep.

146
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:20,952
It was scope creep in the direction

147
00:06:21,293 --> 00:06:24,355
that contained all the interesting things,

148
00:06:24,515 --> 00:06:26,197
interesting possibilities that the game ended up having.

149
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:31,021
And so years later, I finally got an artist.

150
00:06:31,401 --> 00:06:33,763
This is John Roberts' art.

151
00:06:34,664 --> 00:06:37,586
And yeah, the development was just remarkably smooth

152
00:06:37,626 --> 00:06:37,966
on gunpoint.

153
00:06:38,006 --> 00:06:40,408
I just got really lucky that the thing I picked just

154
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:41,770
happened to be within my abilities.

155
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:45,833
That was not in any way a cleverly judged or.

156
00:06:47,651 --> 00:06:51,352
a smart decision on my part, it was just pure luck I happened to pick something that turned

157
00:06:51,392 --> 00:06:53,892
out to be easy for a beginner to do.

158
00:06:54,472 --> 00:07:01,174
And the idea I picked, the hacking thing, just evolved really well.

159
00:07:02,734 --> 00:07:05,735
So this is how I kind of saw gunpoint development at the time.

160
00:07:05,895 --> 00:07:06,795
This is what I thought I did.

161
00:07:07,115 --> 00:07:09,396
And I did do this, but this is only one way of phrasing it.

162
00:07:10,016 --> 00:07:12,596
I made a little bit of everything and then I saw what shone.

163
00:07:13,036 --> 00:07:14,797
The hacking thing was clearly the best thing I made.

164
00:07:17,165 --> 00:07:17,685
I went with that.

165
00:07:18,165 --> 00:07:20,347
And that's a pretty good rule when it works.

166
00:07:21,247 --> 00:07:22,428
Let's look at a case where it didn't work.

167
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:24,950
So this is heat signature.

168
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,272
My idea for heat signature was just go inside spaceships.

169
00:07:28,472 --> 00:07:30,753
It would be cool if you could go inside a spaceship.

170
00:07:31,234 --> 00:07:32,575
You're a spaceship, they're a spaceship,

171
00:07:32,915 --> 00:07:34,596
you dock with them, and you go inside the spaceship.

172
00:07:35,437 --> 00:07:37,898
So to prototype that, I started by just making

173
00:07:38,018 --> 00:07:39,659
some infinite space, you can just fly around

174
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,421
wherever you like in here, and then when you come across

175
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:43,962
an enemy ship, you can drill through it,

176
00:07:44,382 --> 00:07:46,083
and then you go inside the spaceship.

177
00:07:46,693 --> 00:07:48,254
There you are, inside the spaceship.

178
00:07:49,695 --> 00:07:51,536
That, I didn't really know what to conclude from that.

179
00:07:54,157 --> 00:07:55,458
There it is, off you go.

180
00:07:57,719 --> 00:07:59,560
So I'd successfully prototyped the concept,

181
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,082
but obviously there's still some unanswered questions here.

182
00:08:02,122 --> 00:08:03,983
I don't think this conclusively tells you

183
00:08:04,003 --> 00:08:05,184
whether it's gonna be a good game or not.

184
00:08:05,684 --> 00:08:06,925
So I just kind of had to keep making it.

185
00:08:07,345 --> 00:08:10,587
And I made a ship generator.

186
00:08:10,747 --> 00:08:12,068
I knew I wanted randomly generated ships.

187
00:08:13,051 --> 00:08:15,733
So it generates exterior shape and then also interior layout

188
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:18,796
and make sure every room is connected to every other room.

189
00:08:18,816 --> 00:08:22,719
I made enemies with AI and a basic combat system.

190
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:26,221
And all of these rooms are subsystems of the ship.

191
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:28,643
So those guys I just shot, some of those were turret gunners.

192
00:08:28,863 --> 00:08:30,785
And if you take them out, the turret can no longer fire.

193
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,187
That guy with the red X I just shot was my objective.

194
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:34,968
So there's a mission here to kill someone in particular.

195
00:08:36,912 --> 00:08:38,513
I just got shot, that's in there too.

196
00:08:40,655 --> 00:08:44,619
And all of these little red dots, those fuel barrels,

197
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,962
if I blow those up, it not only takes out the thruster,

198
00:08:46,982 --> 00:08:48,183
preventing the ship from flying,

199
00:08:48,203 --> 00:08:49,304
but it also destroys the room,

200
00:08:49,484 --> 00:08:51,066
so all the ships have modular destructibility.

201
00:08:51,787 --> 00:08:53,448
And if I get to the cockpit,

202
00:08:53,528 --> 00:08:55,030
I can take over the ship and fly it myself.

203
00:08:56,022 --> 00:08:57,963
So there's a huge amount of just systems and stuff

204
00:08:58,064 --> 00:09:00,346
that I had to build just to explore this idea,

205
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:03,849
just to find out if there was anything interesting here.

206
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,633
And I think actually that is a mistake in itself.

207
00:09:07,933 --> 00:09:09,494
There was just too much that needed prototyping.

208
00:09:09,534 --> 00:09:11,176
In order to test the idea of heat signature,

209
00:09:11,196 --> 00:09:13,618
I just had to make nearly all of heat signature.

210
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:16,421
Like there wasn't really one single thing

211
00:09:16,461 --> 00:09:18,623
I could just mock up and then find out is this fun or not.

212
00:09:19,003 --> 00:09:20,364
I had to just keep making the whole thing.

213
00:09:22,718 --> 00:09:25,740
So in future, when I'm prototyping stuff,

214
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,941
or when I'm thinking about concepts that I want to prototype,

215
00:09:28,461 --> 00:09:29,142
I'm always going to ask,

216
00:09:29,562 --> 00:09:30,662
how much of this do I have to make

217
00:09:30,722 --> 00:09:31,623
before I know if it works?

218
00:09:31,803 --> 00:09:32,483
That's the key thing.

219
00:09:32,543 --> 00:09:34,064
It's not necessarily how long

220
00:09:34,084 --> 00:09:35,325
will this whole game take to finish,

221
00:09:35,365 --> 00:09:36,586
it's just how much of it do I need to make

222
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,167
before I'll know whether it works or not?

223
00:09:38,807 --> 00:09:40,368
And obviously that's a bit of guesswork as well,

224
00:09:40,408 --> 00:09:42,329
but you can make a much more informed guess about that.

225
00:09:44,574 --> 00:09:49,779
So I just kept working on all the little bits and I looked for an artist and I found a guy

226
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:52,161
called John Roberts, who's the same guy who did the art for Gunpoint.

227
00:09:52,782 --> 00:09:56,465
Not a coincidence that he turned out to be incredibly good at this style of art too.

228
00:09:57,306 --> 00:10:00,569
And I didn't really know what to focus on.

229
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:04,613
Unlike Gunpoint, I'd roughed out everything and it didn't tell me what kind of game it

230
00:10:04,653 --> 00:10:06,835
wanted to make, what kind of game it wanted to be.

231
00:10:07,832 --> 00:10:09,072
No one feature really stood out.

232
00:10:09,432 --> 00:10:10,913
And so I was taking it to shows

233
00:10:11,253 --> 00:10:14,514
and having people play it at EGX and Rez

234
00:10:15,394 --> 00:10:18,335
and asking them, like, what do you think of this?

235
00:10:18,415 --> 00:10:19,496
What should I work on next?

236
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:20,096
What does it need?

237
00:10:20,836 --> 00:10:22,036
And the feedback was really positive.

238
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:22,977
People were enjoying playing it.

239
00:10:23,177 --> 00:10:25,457
But when I asked them what it needed,

240
00:10:25,497 --> 00:10:27,178
there was a very strong trend in their feedback.

241
00:10:27,518 --> 00:10:28,999
Almost everybody said something like,

242
00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:30,939
I wanna know why I'm doing these missions.

243
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:31,780
Like, the missions are fun,

244
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,040
but I wanna know what the context is, why I'm doing it.

245
00:10:34,484 --> 00:10:37,186
because you would just wake up, you get given a mission,

246
00:10:37,486 --> 00:10:40,148
you go and do it, and then it just starts again.

247
00:10:41,109 --> 00:10:42,850
And I was quite pleased with this feedback

248
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:46,472
because I already had a plan for adding context to this game.

249
00:10:47,273 --> 00:10:50,575
And my plan was to make a galaxy.

250
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,917
Actually, just making a galaxy would be too achievable,

251
00:10:53,997 --> 00:10:55,779
so I decided I would make infinite galaxies

252
00:10:56,979 --> 00:10:58,220
by creating a galaxy generator.

253
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:03,979
and all it would do is just create empires of space stations

254
00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:05,219
connected by trade routes,

255
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,360
each space station mining a different resource

256
00:11:08,381 --> 00:11:11,902
from the nebula, and each faction wanting control

257
00:11:12,642 --> 00:11:16,244
of a full set of all the different resources

258
00:11:16,284 --> 00:11:17,704
that they needed to sustain their empire,

259
00:11:17,825 --> 00:11:19,345
and then they would just dynamically push

260
00:11:19,365 --> 00:11:21,526
into each other's territory and try and take space stations

261
00:11:21,546 --> 00:11:23,847
from each other, and that would be it, really,

262
00:11:23,867 --> 00:11:26,728
just a small, controlled metagame.

263
00:11:28,862 --> 00:11:30,564
This is stupid in many ways.

264
00:11:32,727 --> 00:11:39,694
But I think the biggest problem with it is not so much that it's ambitious to make that

265
00:11:39,714 --> 00:11:44,019
whole thing, it's basically the same problem I had with the concept of heat signature itself,

266
00:11:44,099 --> 00:11:47,303
which is just that you kind of have to make all of this before you know if it does anything

267
00:11:47,343 --> 00:11:47,603
at all.

268
00:11:48,064 --> 00:11:48,805
Like, just making that...

269
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:52,542
galaxy that you can zoom out and see felt really cool,

270
00:11:52,802 --> 00:11:55,803
but it didn't answer the question of does this successfully add context to your missions?

271
00:11:55,843 --> 00:11:57,324
Does this solve the problem people are having?

272
00:11:58,164 --> 00:12:00,205
Do people now feel like they have a motivation?

273
00:12:00,545 --> 00:12:03,706
Because at that point, the missions don't connect to that metagame.

274
00:12:03,746 --> 00:12:04,306
It doesn't do anything.

275
00:12:04,706 --> 00:12:06,107
So you've got to make the whole galaxy,

276
00:12:06,147 --> 00:12:08,107
then you've got to make how the galaxy relates to your missions,

277
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:12,869
and then you find out whether the last six months were spent on anything worthwhile at all.

278
00:12:14,438 --> 00:12:16,440
So this is the exact same slide I used last time.

279
00:12:17,461 --> 00:12:18,521
Too much needed prototyping here.

280
00:12:18,662 --> 00:12:19,803
I should have asked, how much of this

281
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,364
do I have to make before I know if it works?

282
00:12:23,266 --> 00:12:29,191
And so I had made quite a lot of that Galaxy stuff

283
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,452
and it wasn't really working out.

284
00:12:31,032 --> 00:12:31,132
And...

285
00:12:34,346 --> 00:12:38,468
Around that time, I went to this developers retreat

286
00:12:38,568 --> 00:12:42,631
called Stugan in Sweden, where you go to cabins in the woods

287
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:46,993
and focus on your game with about 20 other developers.

288
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:54,818
And it's a really good opportunity to focus,

289
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,099
but also to re-evaluate.

290
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:59,661
I got there, and I was still working on this galaxy stuff,

291
00:13:00,341 --> 00:13:01,922
which just wasn't really panning out.

292
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:02,302
It was.

293
00:13:03,732 --> 00:13:03,773
Um...

294
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,785
It was there, and it was adding context to your missions technically,

295
00:13:08,105 --> 00:13:11,687
but it felt kind of arduous, because you'd do a mission,

296
00:13:11,887 --> 00:13:13,387
and then you'd see how it affected the galaxy map,

297
00:13:13,588 --> 00:13:16,349
and if it captured a station or if it did something that you wanted it to do,

298
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:21,411
then you would just kind of see the whole game stretching before you

299
00:13:21,511 --> 00:13:22,931
in kind of a bad way, like,

300
00:13:23,332 --> 00:13:26,973
oh, I just do that again and again and again until this whole galaxy is cleared.

301
00:13:28,214 --> 00:13:30,955
It wasn't an appealing thought.

302
00:13:30,975 --> 00:13:32,916
It actually made the game kind of more tedious.

303
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:38,601
and I've been wrestling with that and reinventing it and trying to solve that problem in all kinds of ways.

304
00:13:39,142 --> 00:13:42,744
When I went to Stugan, the idea of just resuming that work

305
00:13:42,805 --> 00:13:46,067
and just tinkering with that same thing that wasn't working was really unappealing to me.

306
00:13:46,507 --> 00:13:51,772
And so instead, I switched gears and I decided to just work on one of the many other things

307
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,313
I know I'm going to have to work on at some point.

308
00:13:53,793 --> 00:13:55,014
And I worked on the interior game.

309
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:58,657
Like, when you're inside the spaceships, what kind of items can you find?

310
00:13:59,137 --> 00:14:02,539
I added teleporters, grenades, added armor types,

311
00:14:02,979 --> 00:14:03,859
turrets, things like that.

312
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,520
All the stuff I knew I was going to add anyway.

313
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:09,042
But I decided to add it then and there.

314
00:14:09,742 --> 00:14:12,923
And the game started getting better really fast.

315
00:14:13,204 --> 00:14:16,365
It was incredible how efficient that was.

316
00:14:16,425 --> 00:14:18,626
It was just, you add a few items, and they're really cool,

317
00:14:18,706 --> 00:14:19,686
and then you add a few more items,

318
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:21,327
and not only are they cool, but they also interact

319
00:14:21,347 --> 00:14:23,348
with the items you just added in really interesting ways.

320
00:14:23,888 --> 00:14:25,649
So back then, I might actually rewind

321
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:26,569
and see if we can show it.

322
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:26,950
I...

323
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,455
I'm about to put down a proximity grenade

324
00:14:32,095 --> 00:14:34,716
and then use a swapper teleporter on someone in the next room

325
00:14:35,136 --> 00:14:36,416
so that when he switches places with me,

326
00:14:36,496 --> 00:14:38,297
he triggers the proximity grenade I just put down

327
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:39,937
and I can shoot his friends.

328
00:14:42,038 --> 00:14:45,098
So stuff like that just emerged from the rules

329
00:14:45,138 --> 00:14:46,139
I was adding all the time.

330
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:48,139
And that's exactly the kind of game I wanted to make.

331
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:51,420
This game was also aiming to be a bit like Deus Ex

332
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,360
in any way I could possibly make it.

333
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:57,001
And that's exactly the kind of thing I love in Deus Ex

334
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,001
is when a solution emerges from the rules.

335
00:14:59,722 --> 00:15:04,704
And the more items I added, the more that happened, the more fun I had with it, and

336
00:15:04,724 --> 00:15:08,666
I was just getting to the point where every day I worked on it, the game would make me

337
00:15:08,706 --> 00:15:10,567
laugh out loud at something that I didn't expect.

338
00:15:12,165 --> 00:15:16,268
that was surprising and fun and made sense with the rules.

339
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:20,251
So this is clearly what I should have been working on

340
00:15:20,451 --> 00:15:21,432
instead of the galaxy thing.

341
00:15:21,452 --> 00:15:23,973
This is what I should have been working on all along.

342
00:15:24,654 --> 00:15:26,896
But that lesson is kind of useless for all of us

343
00:15:27,556 --> 00:15:29,737
because I'm not gonna make heat signature again.

344
00:15:29,898 --> 00:15:31,078
You're probably not gonna make heat signature.

345
00:15:31,419 --> 00:15:32,019
I don't recommend it.

346
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,403
And so what I want to know is not what I should have done,

347
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,387
but how I could have arrived at that conclusion sooner.

348
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:41,648
Because I did get there in the end,

349
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,331
but this was two and a half years into development

350
00:15:44,371 --> 00:15:45,893
that I finally realized what I should have been working on.

351
00:15:49,564 --> 00:15:51,866
I think the question I asked,

352
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:53,287
what does the game need most,

353
00:15:53,387 --> 00:15:55,189
was the wrong question to ask.

354
00:15:55,549 --> 00:15:56,530
If you could answer that perfectly,

355
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,352
I'm sure that would get you a useful answer,

356
00:15:58,412 --> 00:16:00,674
but it's just too difficult to answer that question.

357
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,477
And really you want a question that focuses you

358
00:16:03,637 --> 00:16:06,200
on what the answer to that is likely to be.

359
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,302
And so now I think the question I should have asked myself

360
00:16:08,362 --> 00:16:09,403
is what is the core of the game?

361
00:16:09,883 --> 00:16:12,025
That is a question that if I had been asked that

362
00:16:14,895 --> 00:16:17,779
one year into development, like two and a half years before I finished the game,

363
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:22,684
I think even then I could have told you it's the interior game, the stuff that's on board.

364
00:16:22,704 --> 00:16:28,490
That's what you're going to spend most of your time doing, it's got to be interesting,

365
00:16:29,171 --> 00:16:32,014
and the way I think of what is the core of the game is to ask this.

366
00:16:32,734 --> 00:16:34,696
Would it ruin the game if this bit was kind of bland?

367
00:16:35,598 --> 00:16:37,799
So the space flight in Heat Signature,

368
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:39,320
could that be kind of bland?

369
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,960
Yeah, and actually it kind of is.

370
00:16:42,161 --> 00:16:43,981
We didn't make that very sophisticated or fun

371
00:16:44,382 --> 00:16:46,382
because the more work we put into that,

372
00:16:46,502 --> 00:16:48,063
the more people it just put off the game

373
00:16:48,163 --> 00:16:51,804
because people who couldn't handle flying stuff

374
00:16:53,105 --> 00:16:54,405
but otherwise might have liked the game

375
00:16:54,785 --> 00:16:55,666
then weren't able to play.

376
00:16:55,926 --> 00:16:58,046
So we just basically left that extremely rudimentary

377
00:16:58,207 --> 00:16:58,707
and that's fine.

378
00:16:58,787 --> 00:17:00,627
And I could have told you that would be fine

379
00:17:01,648 --> 00:17:03,088
even two years before I finished.

380
00:17:03,849 --> 00:17:03,989
So.

381
00:17:05,409 --> 00:17:09,471
If you ask that about, you know, the galaxy map, the strategic layer,

382
00:17:10,092 --> 00:17:11,973
would it ruin the game if that was kind of bland?

383
00:17:12,213 --> 00:17:13,454
No, it actually is kind of bland.

384
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:16,555
And that's true for loads of elements of a heat sink, yeah,

385
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,577
but if you ask me that about the onboard stuff,

386
00:17:18,617 --> 00:17:19,797
like when you go inside the spaceship,

387
00:17:20,298 --> 00:17:21,638
would it ruin the game if that was kind of bland?

388
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,319
Yeah, it would absolutely ruin the game.

389
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:24,200
It would be terrible.

390
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,081
There's just nothing you can add surrounding that

391
00:17:27,121 --> 00:17:29,042
that's ever going to make it a great game

392
00:17:29,242 --> 00:17:30,703
if what happens when you're on board the ship

393
00:17:30,823 --> 00:17:31,563
is just kind of boring.

394
00:17:32,044 --> 00:17:33,804
And so the answer to that question

395
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,845
is going to be different for all kinds of games.

396
00:17:35,925 --> 00:17:38,607
But if you're making a Monkey Island game,

397
00:17:38,907 --> 00:17:39,927
can the dialogue be bland?

398
00:17:40,248 --> 00:17:41,989
No, the dialogue can't be bland in a Monkey Island game.

399
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:43,389
A bunch of other things maybe can,

400
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:46,131
but there's going to be one part of the game

401
00:17:46,151 --> 00:17:50,033
that just has to be unusually good for this to work at all.

402
00:17:52,062 --> 00:17:55,583
And obviously, if you're answering yes to that

403
00:17:56,944 --> 00:17:58,845
on many elements of your game,

404
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:03,146
then cool, but that might take a while.

405
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,967
Like, I'm now looking for...

406
00:18:05,407 --> 00:18:06,947
There are certain kinds of games where, like,

407
00:18:07,328 --> 00:18:08,768
multiple things all need to be good,

408
00:18:09,068 --> 00:18:11,429
and those are the kinds of games that you probably don't want to make if you're alone.

409
00:18:13,737 --> 00:18:16,239
I'm looking for, I will start working alone

410
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:18,761
and then bring in other people if and when I end up

411
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:20,022
with something that's worth making.

412
00:18:21,443 --> 00:18:23,545
And so I'm always looking now for things

413
00:18:23,585 --> 00:18:25,907
that just have a single core,

414
00:18:26,107 --> 00:18:27,208
like something that I think,

415
00:18:27,788 --> 00:18:29,190
okay, this is probably gonna be the core of the game.

416
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:34,114
And so this is my process now.

417
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:39,578
I am going to choose a game idea that's quick to prototype,

418
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:40,899
and quick to prototype means.

419
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,703
You can test whether the idea will work

420
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,805
by making some small part of it, not the whole thing.

421
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,546
So heat signature is bad for that

422
00:18:49,606 --> 00:18:50,807
because going inside spaceships,

423
00:18:51,028 --> 00:18:52,929
you can prototype it, but you don't learn much

424
00:18:52,969 --> 00:18:54,530
unless you also make a whole game around it.

425
00:18:56,812 --> 00:18:58,954
And then prototype the important bits of it.

426
00:18:59,174 --> 00:19:00,735
You get to decide what the important bits of it are.

427
00:19:00,755 --> 00:19:02,136
You probably know why it excites you

428
00:19:02,176 --> 00:19:03,157
and what's interesting about it.

429
00:19:04,281 --> 00:19:07,342
And at that point, decide what the core should be.

430
00:19:07,442 --> 00:19:09,262
So in the case of Gunpoint, that question,

431
00:19:09,302 --> 00:19:10,163
I didn't even need to ask it,

432
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:12,744
because the game just told me this is what the core of it is,

433
00:19:12,824 --> 00:19:13,644
it's gonna be about hacking.

434
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,604
That's by far the most interesting thing.

435
00:19:16,105 --> 00:19:18,005
With Heat Signature, the game didn't tell me that,

436
00:19:18,105 --> 00:19:19,506
and so I kind of got lost in the reads,

437
00:19:19,566 --> 00:19:24,107
and started adding things that weren't really relevant

438
00:19:25,127 --> 00:19:25,948
to the central core of it.

439
00:19:26,168 --> 00:19:27,108
If I just asked that question,

440
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,028
I think I could have answered it,

441
00:19:28,328 --> 00:19:31,809
and exploring that area is exactly what ended up

442
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:32,710
making the game good in the end.

443
00:19:33,869 --> 00:19:34,970
So once you know what the core is,

444
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,170
or once you've decided what the core is,

445
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,311
because you can make it up if you like,

446
00:19:38,592 --> 00:19:40,313
you can scope creep as far as you like in that direction.

447
00:19:40,353 --> 00:19:42,894
Like scope creep is good when it's related

448
00:19:42,994 --> 00:19:45,256
to the core of the game, which is,

449
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:50,058
once you, if you're right about what the core of the game is,

450
00:19:50,318 --> 00:19:52,440
then you can add to it as much as you like.

451
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,500
You can make it more complicated,

452
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,721
you can make it more difficult,

453
00:19:54,781 --> 00:19:56,002
you can make it more sophisticated,

454
00:19:56,042 --> 00:19:58,443
you can expand it, you can make more work for yourself,

455
00:19:59,204 --> 00:20:01,005
as long as it's in the area that is actually

456
00:20:02,005 --> 00:20:03,366
what's special about your game in the first place.

457
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:08,077
So that's what I'm doing next time.

458
00:20:08,437 --> 00:20:11,699
And I want to stress that this is my new process.

459
00:20:11,739 --> 00:20:15,180
I put that specifically at the top to stress that.

460
00:20:16,961 --> 00:20:19,142
This is just what I think is gonna work for me

461
00:20:19,563 --> 00:20:22,564
and for the particular kind of games I like to make.

462
00:20:22,864 --> 00:20:24,905
I'm looking for things that are mechanically interesting.

463
00:20:25,345 --> 00:20:27,926
I want to make things that generate exciting experiences

464
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:30,388
and I want to make those games as quickly as possible.

465
00:20:31,128 --> 00:20:32,509
I don't have a good track record of making them quickly.

466
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:39,574
That's what I'm optimizing for and so I just want to make sure that it doesn't sound like I'm saying this is how you make a game.

467
00:20:40,094 --> 00:20:43,636
This is just my idea for how I can improve my own process.

468
00:20:44,897 --> 00:20:51,461
And the other thing to say is that Heat Signature, it would be easy to talk about it like a success story because it sold really well.

469
00:20:51,621 --> 00:20:56,944
It sold better than Gunpoint. It reviewed well. I'm really happy with it. I have a great time playing it when I play it.

470
00:20:58,505 --> 00:20:59,126
I'm very proud of it.

471
00:21:01,412 --> 00:21:04,855
All of that is only possible because Gunpoint paid for it.

472
00:21:05,836 --> 00:21:06,497
It took way too long.

473
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:08,778
What really happened is I failed to make a good game

474
00:21:08,818 --> 00:21:09,759
in a reasonable amount of time.

475
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,721
Two years in, I did not have a good game.

476
00:21:12,281 --> 00:21:15,244
I devoted a huge amount of time and money to it,

477
00:21:15,664 --> 00:21:17,145
and I had failed to make it work.

478
00:21:17,546 --> 00:21:19,427
And if I was under the same kind of financial constraints

479
00:21:19,447 --> 00:21:21,509
that most people are, I would have just had to release it

480
00:21:21,529 --> 00:21:23,070
in a bad state or just give up.

481
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,912
My whole career may well have been over.

482
00:21:25,532 --> 00:21:27,994
So it only worked out because I have the enormous privilege

483
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:28,094
of...

484
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,433
being able to afford to make those kinds of mistakes

485
00:21:31,494 --> 00:21:32,074
and learn from them.

486
00:21:32,215 --> 00:21:33,677
So I feel like the least I can do

487
00:21:33,737 --> 00:21:34,759
is to share what I did learn.

488
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,742
So I hope it's been useful.

489
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:37,283
Thank you.

490
00:21:46,827 --> 00:21:48,228
So we have time for a few questions.

491
00:21:48,288 --> 00:21:49,389
If you'd like to ask Tom a question,

492
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:50,971
please come to one of the mics in the aisles.

493
00:21:51,871 --> 00:21:53,993
And I'll start things off then, Tom.

494
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:56,515
You have a background in the games press, right?

495
00:21:57,836 --> 00:21:59,457
Do you consider the press when you're

496
00:21:59,477 --> 00:22:01,439
coming up with the concepts for the games

497
00:22:01,459 --> 00:22:02,240
that you're going to be working on?

498
00:22:03,538 --> 00:22:13,543
No. I guess I can fall back on the fact that maybe because I was press for related reasons,

499
00:22:14,744 --> 00:22:17,785
if there's an idea that really excites me, I just assume it's going to excite some other

500
00:22:17,805 --> 00:22:20,626
people as well. And I think actually the game...

501
00:22:22,447 --> 00:22:26,949
The scene more and more supports lots of little niches,

502
00:22:27,229 --> 00:22:29,570
and lots of, well, actually big niches.

503
00:22:31,071 --> 00:22:32,351
And it feels like now,

504
00:22:32,411 --> 00:22:33,932
if you're really, really excited about a game idea,

505
00:22:34,332 --> 00:22:36,493
and you're right to be excited about the game idea,

506
00:22:37,193 --> 00:22:39,734
i.e. it pans out, then there's probably gonna be

507
00:22:39,754 --> 00:22:41,115
a bunch of people who are excited about it too.

508
00:22:41,455 --> 00:22:43,376
And I think I've been especially lucky that

509
00:22:44,256 --> 00:22:46,277
the kinds of games that excite me are.

510
00:22:47,485 --> 00:22:52,747
like I say, Deus Ex and stuff, which are not like the biggest selling games in the world, but there's, you know,

511
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:56,629
several million people who love those games to death.

512
00:22:56,889 --> 00:23:02,111
And so as long as those million people continue to exist, they're probably hopefully gonna like things I think of.

513
00:23:03,532 --> 00:23:03,692
Thanks.

514
00:23:06,914 --> 00:23:12,396
On the subject of that, how did you find kind of wrestling with your audience in terms of them kind of

515
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:16,347
like feeding into your scope creep.

516
00:23:16,807 --> 00:23:19,169
So like, you know, then you kind of talking about

517
00:23:19,209 --> 00:23:20,610
something that was sinking your time,

518
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,151
and then the audience being,

519
00:23:22,171 --> 00:23:23,712
go on, go on, add more features,

520
00:23:23,772 --> 00:23:24,613
get more stuff in.

521
00:23:24,693 --> 00:23:26,114
How did you kind of counter that?

522
00:23:27,174 --> 00:23:28,976
Yeah, so the question is,

523
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:33,659
how do I counter other people feeding into my scope creep

524
00:23:33,699 --> 00:23:34,439
by suggesting things?

525
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:40,083
And I listen to people's suggestions

526
00:23:40,143 --> 00:23:41,204
and say, oh, that's a cool idea,

527
00:23:41,244 --> 00:23:41,865
and then I don't do them.

528
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,280
You have to get very used to doing that.

529
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,281
You just have to do that a lot.

530
00:23:48,321 --> 00:23:50,061
Because there are some good ideas,

531
00:23:50,081 --> 00:23:52,502
and I definitely did benefit from people's suggestions

532
00:23:52,742 --> 00:23:54,423
on Heatsink Show and Gunpoint,

533
00:23:55,563 --> 00:23:57,944
and especially friends who I specifically asked

534
00:23:57,984 --> 00:23:58,624
for ideas from.

535
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,525
But sort of 95% of the ideas you're gonna get

536
00:24:01,705 --> 00:24:04,126
are not necessarily bad, they're just outside the scope.

537
00:24:04,206 --> 00:24:04,827
As you say, it's...

538
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,101
If you're going to be able to resist your own scope creep,

539
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:12,163
you at least need to be able to resist other people's ideas for your game.

540
00:24:12,624 --> 00:24:15,606
And so Heatsinger chose— was the worst for this because it, uh...

541
00:24:17,518 --> 00:24:19,118
could be a million different games.

542
00:24:19,138 --> 00:24:20,619
It could be Eve, it could be...

543
00:24:20,639 --> 00:24:22,520
There's something about space games in particular

544
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,640
that makes people sort of want them to be everything.

545
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,241
I think because there are space games

546
00:24:26,261 --> 00:24:27,201
that are trying to be everything.

547
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:28,702
So people assume that every space game

548
00:24:28,762 --> 00:24:29,442
wants to be everything.

549
00:24:29,842 --> 00:24:32,263
So people keep asking why you can't mine asteroids

550
00:24:32,623 --> 00:24:35,324
or build your own ships or start your own empire

551
00:24:35,364 --> 00:24:36,845
and have a crew and all this other stuff.

552
00:24:36,925 --> 00:24:39,526
And the answer is because that's nine other games.

553
00:24:40,726 --> 00:24:42,348
and it was hard enough to make one.

554
00:24:43,069 --> 00:24:44,851
So, yeah, I just,

555
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:48,156
I don't shoot down people's suggestions.

556
00:24:48,176 --> 00:24:49,497
I just quietly ignore them.

557
00:24:50,439 --> 00:24:51,280
Okay, thank you.

558
00:24:53,478 --> 00:24:56,880
Hey, I think when you spoke about the development of Gunpoint,

559
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,081
you had mentioned that because you only had weekends,

560
00:24:59,201 --> 00:25:02,723
you were specifically picking tasks that fit within a day

561
00:25:02,923 --> 00:25:06,384
or the weekend as a natural constraint.

562
00:25:06,664 --> 00:25:09,345
Was that something that you thought of or tried to apply to this?

563
00:25:09,786 --> 00:25:12,427
Or did that just go out the window because you didn't feel the need to?

564
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:14,308
Arguably, I should have.

565
00:25:15,368 --> 00:25:16,689
I didn't. Sorry, I know, I was blowing up.

566
00:25:19,509 --> 00:25:26,472
Yeah, Gunpoint was mostly weekends and that did change the pace of development in lots

567
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:32,714
of ways and I said earlier that Heat Singer is probably three times as long because in

568
00:25:32,994 --> 00:25:39,716
number of days it was certainly at least that, but there is a sort of hidden benefit to having

569
00:25:39,776 --> 00:25:43,858
five days of not working on your game in between the two days that you do work on your game

570
00:25:43,878 --> 00:25:46,119
because you come back a lot smarter I think.

571
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:47,479
And I think...

572
00:25:48,412 --> 00:25:51,914
There are some tasks that do not fit into a weekend and that was a problem with Gunpoint.

573
00:25:52,374 --> 00:25:56,217
I had lost a lot of time to sitting down to it on a Saturday morning and thinking, what

574
00:25:56,257 --> 00:25:56,737
was I doing?

575
00:25:56,817 --> 00:25:58,599
Like, how was I going to solve this?

576
00:25:58,639 --> 00:25:59,119
I don't remember.

577
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,783
But equally, I had a week to sort of sanity check everything.

578
00:26:04,883 --> 00:26:08,705
So I come back and thinking, you know, sometimes I sit down and think, wait, why was I doing

579
00:26:08,725 --> 00:26:08,886
this?

580
00:26:08,926 --> 00:26:10,567
And I discover I should not have been doing this.

581
00:26:10,607 --> 00:26:11,728
This is a complete waste of time.

582
00:26:13,329 --> 00:26:16,512
So it had ups and downs, and yeah,

583
00:26:16,552 --> 00:26:18,474
no I didn't try and apply that to Heatsink Show,

584
00:26:18,594 --> 00:26:23,118
I just assumed that having more time to work on a game

585
00:26:23,178 --> 00:26:24,279
would just be outright better.

586
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:28,183
And yeah, that was probably a contributing factor

587
00:26:28,203 --> 00:26:31,285
into me sort of failing to control the direction

588
00:26:31,326 --> 00:26:33,347
of the production as well as I did with Gunpoint.

589
00:26:34,068 --> 00:26:34,388
Thanks.

590
00:26:37,211 --> 00:26:37,832
You go ahead over here.

591
00:26:39,363 --> 00:26:39,943
I think you were first.

592
00:26:40,284 --> 00:26:43,746
So I was wondering, a few years ago you did an article of how to explain your game to

593
00:26:43,786 --> 00:26:45,668
an asshole, as you.

594
00:26:46,048 --> 00:26:50,131
I'm curious, do you explain your game to you when you explain it?

595
00:26:50,712 --> 00:26:54,455
How do you explain gunpoint, how do you explain heat signature?

596
00:26:55,255 --> 00:26:58,718
I practice explaining it to other people, so explaining it to myself would be too easy

597
00:26:58,738 --> 00:27:02,041
because I can read between the lines and I know what I mean by everything.

598
00:27:03,528 --> 00:27:06,849
But yeah, Gunpoint, I changed how I described it to people

599
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:09,671
continuously for all three years that I was working on it.

600
00:27:09,731 --> 00:27:13,412
And actually still now, we did a Steam sale a few years ago.

601
00:27:13,432 --> 00:27:17,234
It was like two years after Gunpoint came out

602
00:27:17,294 --> 00:27:18,875
and I decided to change the pitch for Gunpoint.

603
00:27:19,755 --> 00:27:21,496
I think I have a better way to just explain this game now.

604
00:27:22,717 --> 00:27:23,897
So it's something I constantly work on.

605
00:27:26,218 --> 00:27:29,560
And yeah, for Heat Signature,

606
00:27:31,648 --> 00:27:33,870
yeah, just keep writing like a little blurb and,

607
00:27:34,331 --> 00:27:36,132
actually conferences are the best place to kind of hone this

608
00:27:36,193 --> 00:27:39,396
because when you explain to someone at an event,

609
00:27:39,916 --> 00:27:40,997
you get to see their reaction,

610
00:27:41,037 --> 00:27:42,419
you get to see whether they grasp it or not.

611
00:27:42,499 --> 00:27:43,900
And that's the key thing is just,

612
00:27:44,321 --> 00:27:45,602
have they even understood what I'm saying?

613
00:27:46,803 --> 00:27:48,425
And I definitely changed my mind about

614
00:27:48,685 --> 00:27:50,567
how to explain that a lot of times.

615
00:27:51,408 --> 00:27:51,548
Thanks.

616
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:52,970
Okay, go ahead.

617
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:58,611
Okay, Tom, I just wanted to say, I think a couple years ago you did that Game Maker series

618
00:27:58,671 --> 00:28:00,252
about learning to program games.

619
00:28:00,272 --> 00:28:04,314
I just wanted to say thank you because it came to me at a time when I kind of stopped

620
00:28:04,674 --> 00:28:06,315
with Flash dying and stuff.

621
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:07,876
So thank you for that.

622
00:28:08,176 --> 00:28:11,918
And other than that, when you were making Heat Signature...

623
00:28:12,694 --> 00:28:16,897
Did you kind of feel, like how far into it did you feel that you had to sort of shift gears

624
00:28:17,217 --> 00:28:22,380
before working the interior or was it kind of like a frog in water starting to boil where

625
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,021
you just didn't notice for the longest time?

626
00:28:26,478 --> 00:28:32,263
Yeah, I noticed that it wasn't coming together and I actually got kind of burnt out at GDC two years ago.

627
00:28:32,283 --> 00:28:39,148
I remember talking to friends here and saying like I think I'm just going to take two months off and try and do something else and take a break.

628
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:46,614
What I ended up doing in that break was making another game called Morphblade because it turns out that if I take a break from game development, I just think about game development the entire time.

629
00:28:46,735 --> 00:28:48,896
So the only thing that can actually distract me is just a different game.

630
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,061
So yeah, I wasn't unaware that it was failing to come together.

631
00:28:55,522 --> 00:29:01,327
And it was, like I said, at Stugan when I started to figure it out,

632
00:29:01,608 --> 00:29:08,894
and that was sort of June of 2016, I want to say.

633
00:29:09,294 --> 00:29:12,397
So like a year and a bit before it finished.

634
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:13,538
Thank you.

635
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:17,261
And in general, actually, I think that seems to be a pattern that like...

636
00:29:18,017 --> 00:29:19,218
after you figure out what your game is

637
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:20,138
and get to the heart of it

638
00:29:20,178 --> 00:29:21,659
and have a good working prototype,

639
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:23,000
it's about a year before you're done.

640
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,441
Okay, we only have time for one more.

641
00:29:25,662 --> 00:29:26,582
Cool.

642
00:29:26,722 --> 00:29:28,503
So when figuring out your core,

643
00:29:29,264 --> 00:29:32,265
how did you start looking at your game

644
00:29:32,325 --> 00:29:34,787
in terms of mechanics that add to it

645
00:29:34,867 --> 00:29:36,628
and then things that you were bringing into it?

646
00:29:36,688 --> 00:29:38,329
Like what kind of things did you start

647
00:29:38,509 --> 00:29:41,571
as like a rule set to add and subtract from your game?

648
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:47,341
For the gadgets and stuff and heat signature, I started with teleporters because it was

649
00:29:47,421 --> 00:29:49,741
the easiest thing I could imagine to code.

650
00:29:50,402 --> 00:29:53,042
You just click where you want to go and then you change the player's position to where

651
00:29:53,062 --> 00:29:53,662
the cursor is.

652
00:29:54,363 --> 00:29:55,063
That's a teleporter.

653
00:29:56,703 --> 00:29:59,344
And then I knew that would be too powerful because the whole game is about trying to

654
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:02,124
get to a certain location, so I came up with downsides for them.

655
00:30:03,425 --> 00:30:07,769
And actually, yeah, that was why I was planning on teleporters and I'd actually been planning

656
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:08,429
them for a long time.

657
00:30:08,449 --> 00:30:12,573
I had this sort of document of ideas for devices and stuff and I just kept having new ideas

658
00:30:12,593 --> 00:30:13,093
for teleporters.

659
00:30:13,113 --> 00:30:15,175
I had about seven ideas for teleporters for some reason.

660
00:30:16,716 --> 00:30:22,361
And adding those in with their constraints, there's one that can only swap you with people,

661
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:25,223
there's one that can take you wherever you want but it takes you back two seconds later,

662
00:30:26,384 --> 00:30:26,965
and then there's one...

663
00:30:27,545 --> 00:30:32,269
that can take you to anywhere that you could get to by walking anyway, instantly.

664
00:30:33,891 --> 00:30:38,054
And those all just felt really interesting to mess around with.

665
00:30:38,074 --> 00:30:39,315
So mostly it was just experimentation.

666
00:30:41,984 --> 00:30:44,986
I focus on the easiest things to make first and then see if they're any good.

667
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:48,209
And usually they are or they need just like a small tweak to make them good.

668
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:54,254
And so I didn't have like a big like unifying rule sets of what items could or couldn't

669
00:30:54,294 --> 00:30:54,454
be.

670
00:30:54,874 --> 00:30:57,536
What I did need to do is figure out a system for like how they're.

671
00:30:58,077 --> 00:30:59,517
programmed sort of how they're implemented.

672
00:31:00,377 --> 00:31:02,178
And so in Heat Signature, it's traits.

673
00:31:02,418 --> 00:31:03,558
Every item has a list of traits,

674
00:31:03,798 --> 00:31:05,018
and it's just a list of strings.

675
00:31:05,758 --> 00:31:08,419
The data that we save doesn't store any stats

676
00:31:08,439 --> 00:31:09,139
about the weapon at all.

677
00:31:09,499 --> 00:31:11,640
The game just knows, oh, if it's long range,

678
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,860
that means it goes this far,

679
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,760
and if it's silence, that means it makes this much noise.

680
00:31:15,801 --> 00:31:17,481
And that applies to like melee weapons,

681
00:31:17,541 --> 00:31:19,101
grenades, teleporters, all that stuff.

682
00:31:19,922 --> 00:31:20,702
And so that was really useful.

683
00:31:20,982 --> 00:31:22,202
And that also starts to inspire you

684
00:31:22,242 --> 00:31:23,542
