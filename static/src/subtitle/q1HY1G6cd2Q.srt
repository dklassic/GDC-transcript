1
00:00:07,387 --> 00:00:09,987
Hi, welcome all to our session,

2
00:00:11,187 --> 00:00:12,868
The Evolving Audio Culture.

3
00:00:18,209 --> 00:00:19,289
I'm Tomohiro Yajima.

4
00:00:20,069 --> 00:00:23,070
I've designed the sound effects in Xenogear's

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,850
and Vagrant's story and the Final Fantasy series.

6
00:00:28,271 --> 00:00:31,091
I was sound designer, audio director,

7
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:34,772
sound system architect in 11, 12, and 13 trilogy.

8
00:00:38,985 --> 00:00:51,788
Also, I am in charge of audio engineering of Dragon Quest X and I'm supervising the audio of Dragon Quest X on smartphones.

9
00:00:54,149 --> 00:01:00,991
In short, I have been involved in JRPG audio for years.

10
00:01:09,029 --> 00:01:11,652
or you might have guessed by now.

11
00:01:12,553 --> 00:01:15,557
But I'm not a great English speaker.

12
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:18,640
I'll try my best.

13
00:01:20,523 --> 00:01:24,968
So please, no flames about my bad English in the session.

14
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:31,155
So he might start speaking in Japanese like that, so I'm going to translate in that case.

15
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:31,655
And hi, I'm Yuichi.

16
00:01:54,673 --> 00:01:56,333
I'm an audio programmer in Square Enix,

17
00:01:56,393 --> 00:01:58,674
and I joined the Square Enix sound team five years ago.

18
00:01:59,054 --> 00:02:01,554
I worked on Final Fantasy XIII, too,

19
00:02:02,195 --> 00:02:04,455
The Lightning Returns, Kingdom Hearts HD,

20
00:02:04,495 --> 00:02:06,936
Dragon Quest, and some... lots of JRPGs.

21
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:10,817
And as Justin just mentioned, it's been like years,

22
00:02:10,917 --> 00:02:13,397
but I was, like, in third or fourth grade back then,

23
00:02:13,457 --> 00:02:16,438
so not that much into the history of development.

24
00:02:17,038 --> 00:02:19,018
But I'm gonna, like, talk about what's going on

25
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:21,019
in the present time and the technology

26
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:23,359
and help him in English, I guess.

27
00:02:28,474 --> 00:02:31,897
Okay?

28
00:02:32,037 --> 00:02:34,499
Including the growing stories,

29
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,262
including Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest,

30
00:02:39,063 --> 00:02:42,866
Square Enix has created numerous RPGs.

31
00:02:44,428 --> 00:02:48,371
They are known all over the world as JRPGs.

32
00:02:50,493 --> 00:02:55,077
And have developed their own distinct cultures.

33
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:06,059
I have been involved in RPG development as audio engineer and audio director for 19 years.

34
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:19,371
And through that experience, I have encountered many discrepancies between what is done here and abroad.

35
00:03:21,513 --> 00:03:22,133
I will go...

36
00:03:23,845 --> 00:03:29,589
I will be going into the details later in the session.

37
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:37,774
But some of them are.

38
00:03:39,315 --> 00:03:43,638
Music that is constantly being played.

39
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:48,861
The point of focus in ambient sounds.

40
00:03:50,182 --> 00:03:51,783
Characterization in voice.

41
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:57,313
sound, system sound effects in this session.

42
00:03:58,774 --> 00:04:04,598
We would like to introduce the techniques peculiar to Japan.

43
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,262
Some of these may seem unnatural to you,

44
00:04:11,944 --> 00:04:17,668
but I will be bringing new ideas and points of focus

45
00:04:17,748 --> 00:04:20,670
to the developers from all over.

46
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:28,852
the world is going to make the future of game audio brighter and wider.

47
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:41,998
Today, I am looking forward to starting various discussion about the Japanese creativity.

48
00:04:55,829 --> 00:05:07,857
First, let's look at how JRPG works. Since the RPGs in the ages of Nintendo, players

49
00:05:08,037 --> 00:05:17,503
explored the world, strengthened the characters, and challenged strong enemies to reach the

50
00:05:17,663 --> 00:05:20,365
ending. And today.

51
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:29,433
The basic process is unchanged well, actually.

52
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:42,162
I'm sure most games work like this, not just JRPGs.

53
00:05:52,404 --> 00:06:07,336
And as RPG, the process is directly divided into story section, exploration section, battle section, and more.

54
00:06:09,738 --> 00:06:14,562
And completing missions is the basic flow of the game.

55
00:06:16,224 --> 00:06:20,507
In RPGs, the game is driven by the story.

56
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:29,764
From the opening to the ending, the player has the control.

57
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,467
But it is the control.

58
00:06:36,328 --> 00:06:42,071
To say, of turning the page, I would

59
00:06:42,131 --> 00:06:46,273
say it's like reading a book or seeing a movie.

60
00:06:47,854 --> 00:06:50,316
This is the standard in Japan.

61
00:06:52,135 --> 00:06:55,937
And games such as Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy

62
00:06:56,237 --> 00:06:59,660
are representative cases of this.

63
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:06,184
The diagram here shows how there may

64
00:07:07,084 --> 00:07:11,407
be some options for the player to proceed the story.

65
00:07:13,869 --> 00:07:18,892
But those options are limited by the game designers and,

66
00:07:20,553 --> 00:07:20,853
of course.

67
00:07:22,807 --> 00:07:25,369
do not affect the story at all.

68
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,712
You can see that this is looking to a different direction

69
00:07:32,772 --> 00:07:35,694
compared to the Western RPGs.

70
00:07:37,555 --> 00:07:42,097
Where the game is driven by the player.

71
00:07:43,818 --> 00:07:44,278
Players.

72
00:07:46,739 --> 00:07:51,122
As a character existing in the virtual world.

73
00:07:52,788 --> 00:07:55,369
Please enjoy the role play.

74
00:08:08,374 --> 00:08:14,757
Next, let's talk about JRPG up to the present time.

75
00:08:16,137 --> 00:08:21,940
When JRPG users play the latest title of the series.

76
00:08:23,827 --> 00:08:24,968
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

77
00:08:25,348 --> 00:08:25,448
Hmm.

78
00:08:25,468 --> 00:08:25,528
Hmm.

79
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:28,310
Hmm.

80
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,070
See ya, Charley.

81
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:29,151
Hmm.

82
00:08:29,171 --> 00:08:29,251
Hmm.

83
00:08:29,271 --> 00:08:29,331
Hmm.

84
00:08:32,653 --> 00:08:37,476
Most of them do not expect something completely brand new,

85
00:08:37,576 --> 00:08:42,199
but look at how it has evolved from the previous.

86
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,621
These are seen in UI style.

87
00:08:48,302 --> 00:08:52,085
Game process, battle system, and more.

88
00:08:54,378 --> 00:09:00,002
To explain this phenomenon in one word, it is a tradition.

89
00:09:02,304 --> 00:09:07,167
JRPG series such as Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy

90
00:09:07,187 --> 00:09:11,510
have continued to build up on the previous projects,

91
00:09:13,731 --> 00:09:16,233
adding new features while keeping

92
00:09:16,293 --> 00:09:18,454
the good part of the series.

93
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:27,188
So we are the latest cutting edge creativity

94
00:09:27,368 --> 00:09:31,009
into the traditional and historical game play.

95
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:37,770
It is the same in the technology aspect as well.

96
00:09:40,691 --> 00:09:46,071
These JRPGs have the tendency to be always

97
00:09:46,131 --> 00:09:49,692
compared to other games of the same genre.

98
00:09:52,242 --> 00:09:52,762
genre.

99
00:09:54,963 --> 00:09:59,685
And so every developer competes for the new ideas.

100
00:10:02,147 --> 00:10:07,429
Especially for audio history, many ingenuity

101
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:09,991
have come out in JRPGs.

102
00:10:12,892 --> 00:10:18,775
And I believe JRPGs have introduced

103
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,837
many new games of audio.

104
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,781
futures to the world.

105
00:10:25,702 --> 00:10:30,445
Let's break down the history by hard and see how

106
00:10:31,445 --> 00:10:34,567
JRPGs developed through the ages.

107
00:10:44,452 --> 00:10:48,214
Let's start with Nintendo, Super Nintendo.

108
00:10:52,817 --> 00:10:54,398
Nintendo and Super Nintendo,

109
00:10:54,418 --> 00:10:56,880
I've already developed them.

110
00:10:58,322 --> 00:11:01,825
Okay, how many of you have developed something on Nintendo or Super Nintendo?

111
00:11:01,865 --> 00:11:02,626
Could you raise your hand?

112
00:11:02,646 --> 00:11:05,549
Oh!

113
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:06,730
Legend!

114
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:11,114
I'm sorry, I don't have.

115
00:11:12,835 --> 00:11:14,117
Ha ha ha ha!

116
00:11:14,137 --> 00:11:14,217
No?

117
00:11:14,277 --> 00:11:15,678
I was playing with this back then.

118
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:18,441
You were still a user back then.

119
00:11:18,939 --> 00:11:24,902
When he joined Square Enix, he was developing the last of the Super Nintendo games, so he

120
00:11:24,922 --> 00:11:26,522
didn't actually join the development.

121
00:11:42,353 --> 00:11:45,655
I'm sure those who raise their hand right now is pretty old.

122
00:11:45,675 --> 00:11:50,379
Right?

123
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,719
Right?

124
00:11:52,821 --> 00:11:59,145
The games of this time is audio original netting by this time.

125
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:04,829
Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest already

126
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:09,012
became popular to be the representative titles

127
00:12:09,213 --> 00:12:10,333
of Japanese games.

128
00:12:11,825 --> 00:12:18,447
These two JRPGs adopted the command battle system and up till today.

129
00:12:20,828 --> 00:12:25,249
JRPG developers have kept this as the standard.

130
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,191
While bringing innovation to it,

131
00:12:32,732 --> 00:12:37,953
due to the hardware limitations back at this time.

132
00:12:40,131 --> 00:12:44,372
Graphic rendering was nothing near realistic.

133
00:12:45,993 --> 00:12:49,614
So to bring the user into the story,

134
00:12:51,914 --> 00:12:56,216
music took important role in assisting

135
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,516
the graphics and story.

136
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,738
This is why music for

137
00:13:05,055 --> 00:13:11,181
These games are highly emotional and melodious.

138
00:13:13,402 --> 00:13:20,348
And also, it is not that the length of the music.

139
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:26,513
Considering the file size at that time.

140
00:13:29,105 --> 00:13:33,829
is rather long, many creative ideas

141
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:41,334
were invented to cover the lack of simultaneous notes.

142
00:13:44,196 --> 00:13:47,418
And the number of trucks, too,

143
00:13:47,558 --> 00:13:51,361
were larger, considering the storage.

144
00:13:54,223 --> 00:13:55,443
On the other hand,

145
00:13:58,363 --> 00:14:02,304
Sound effects were mostly composed of noise

146
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,025
and basic waveforms.

147
00:14:05,565 --> 00:14:08,086
Simple and small in quality.

148
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:22,350
Next game, PlayStation.

149
00:14:24,592 --> 00:14:29,073
Recordings of their musical instruments were adopted.

150
00:14:30,234 --> 00:14:31,374
But at this time.

151
00:14:38,057 --> 00:14:39,398
But at this time.

152
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:45,980
Music was still programmed as sequence data.

153
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:53,183
JRPGs require a large quantity of music tracks.

154
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:59,494
But, media stories was yet not enough for

155
00:14:59,974 --> 00:15:02,376
streaming recorded tracks.

156
00:15:04,998 --> 00:15:06,679
In this time of history,

157
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,041
attempt for reality.

158
00:15:12,143 --> 00:15:16,185
Such as stopping the music and playing

159
00:15:16,325 --> 00:15:18,587
the ambient sounds only.

160
00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:23,170
Were made, however,

161
00:15:25,894 --> 00:15:33,818
BGM had already became a prerequisite in the Nintendo Super Nintendo games.

162
00:15:35,658 --> 00:15:40,961
And many users had been excited for it.

163
00:15:44,062 --> 00:15:49,965
So such attempts are at many times considered as a bug.

164
00:15:52,278 --> 00:15:52,478
Bugs?

165
00:15:52,698 --> 00:15:52,979
Bugs.

166
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:53,919
Bugs.

167
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,763
Music stopped for some reason.

168
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:06,350
Since then, some kind of music is always

169
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,332
being played in every scene.

170
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:16,138
Also, some effects have started to be important.

171
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:20,001
Not only the quality.

172
00:16:21,967 --> 00:16:30,032
But the quantity and the number of simultaneous playback

173
00:16:30,332 --> 00:16:30,832
enhanced.

174
00:16:32,413 --> 00:16:38,197
Also, from the emergence of movie scenes,

175
00:16:39,718 --> 00:16:44,281
the directors started to require audio rendering

176
00:16:44,741 --> 00:16:49,044
like the movies in the theaters.

177
00:16:51,045 --> 00:16:52,226
as for voices.

178
00:16:54,288 --> 00:16:58,791
The storage was not quite enough yet to be used

179
00:16:58,991 --> 00:16:59,992
throughout the game.

180
00:17:01,273 --> 00:17:05,956
And only in movies, scenes, characters, spoke the lines.

181
00:17:08,718 --> 00:17:15,123
But to use the voices to elaborate the characters.

182
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:19,746
What we call battle voices were

183
00:17:20,293 --> 00:17:20,913
implemented.

184
00:17:24,235 --> 00:17:27,296
You each will describe later.

185
00:17:27,917 --> 00:17:28,097
No?

186
00:17:28,777 --> 00:17:28,937
Koko.

187
00:17:30,938 --> 00:17:31,478
Yeah.

188
00:17:31,979 --> 00:17:32,999
I'll describe it later.

189
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:39,342
But this became the standard in JRPGs.

190
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:47,667
This is when game, not only audio, changed drastically.

191
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,989
So the time of the PlayStation was when the game changed a lot.

192
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:57,870
So the visual aspects of RPGs changed so much during this time.

193
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,030
Next, the era of PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

194
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:30,263
Everyone started to learn from the methods of movie production.

195
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:39,449
And I believe this is the time where everyone started to look for better quality in audio.

196
00:18:50,356 --> 00:18:56,018
Because JRPGs require three times the number of sound

197
00:18:56,338 --> 00:18:59,679
files compared to other genres of games.

198
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:07,782
Many in-house tools were created to cut down the cost.

199
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:16,265
But at this time, almost no tools were used.

200
00:19:17,426 --> 00:19:17,926
That is.

201
00:19:19,597 --> 00:19:25,622
Tools were developed for each and every project, every time.

202
00:19:27,644 --> 00:19:27,844
Tools.

203
00:19:30,427 --> 00:19:30,627
Tools.

204
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:30,787
Tools.

205
00:19:31,608 --> 00:19:31,748
Tools.

206
00:19:31,788 --> 00:19:31,908
Tools.

207
00:19:35,311 --> 00:19:35,591
Tools.

208
00:19:36,232 --> 00:19:42,817
The increase in storage helped the audio quality tremendously.

209
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:46,501
Every character's voice.

210
00:19:49,402 --> 00:19:52,383
movies became 5.1 channel.

211
00:19:53,964 --> 00:19:56,446
Also, for instance,

212
00:19:56,726 --> 00:20:01,028
and other methods developed in the movie scene

213
00:20:02,229 --> 00:20:03,530
were incorporated.

214
00:20:05,911 --> 00:20:07,372
Oh, and yes,

215
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:13,616
this is when the amount of interface

216
00:20:13,756 --> 00:20:15,697
sets grew

217
00:20:17,558 --> 00:20:18,378
exponentially.

218
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:24,839
As menu interfaces, such as character making,

219
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:29,382
became complex, the user's sojourn time

220
00:20:29,682 --> 00:20:32,063
in the menus increased.

221
00:20:34,464 --> 00:20:38,226
And more and more, some effects were

222
00:20:38,346 --> 00:20:41,608
necessary to not just avoid redundancy,

223
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:50,093
but to establish the part of the game world in the menus.

224
00:20:52,085 --> 00:21:00,792
Game-wise, from the factors such as the emergence of MMO RPGs,

225
00:21:04,095 --> 00:21:07,217
real-time action became the mainstream.

226
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:16,185
So some aspects of JRPGs, such as command-style battles.

227
00:21:19,452 --> 00:21:24,318
struggled to accommodate to the environment.

228
00:21:26,681 --> 00:21:30,666
This was truly the age of technical innovation

229
00:21:32,608 --> 00:21:37,154
as an example in Final Fantasy XII.

230
00:21:39,913 --> 00:21:50,623
We were unsatisfied with the fact that only movies were in 5.1 channel and used Prologix

231
00:21:51,204 --> 00:21:54,787
2 to have surround environment throughout the game.

232
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,769
PS2 had surround sound,

233
00:22:02,009 --> 00:22:06,433
and the movie scenes were 5.1 channels,

234
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:10,857
and Dolby Digital was available.

235
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,919
Who has surround sound at home now?

236
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,282
So this is the time when the surround sound came in.

237
00:22:18,343 --> 00:22:21,926
And he wants to know how many of you have a surround sound system at home

238
00:22:22,206 --> 00:22:22,927
when you play games?

239
00:22:24,608 --> 00:22:25,809
Oh, quite a lot.

240
00:22:26,189 --> 00:22:26,950
Oh, a lot.

241
00:22:27,674 --> 00:22:31,536
In Japan, it's pretty small, so it's not really popular to have a lot of speakers.

242
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:34,038
Well, it's not popular at all, but...

243
00:22:34,118 --> 00:22:37,319
Instead, virtual headphones are popular these days.

244
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,962
So everyone is enjoying surround sound with virtual headphones.

245
00:22:41,022 --> 00:22:43,063
And in high-end games, you have to be able to surround sound as expected,

246
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:45,604
and that's become a very popular thing in this era.

247
00:22:55,222 --> 00:22:58,985
As you might know, in Japan, there's not much space for the surround speakers.

248
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:02,048
So, most people use surround headphones, they said.

249
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:04,530
And that's getting popular in Japan.

250
00:23:06,112 --> 00:23:09,595
Like, for the high-end games, we have to, like, make the sound surround.

251
00:23:10,436 --> 00:23:18,343
So, and this is when that was, that tradition, or, that was starting to come in.

252
00:23:24,365 --> 00:23:26,946
I didn't say that Japanese houses are like rabbit cages.

253
00:23:30,908 --> 00:23:31,168
Sorry.

254
00:23:41,432 --> 00:23:47,174
Last of the history section comes, uh, PlayStation 3, uh, uh, Xbox 360.

255
00:23:49,785 --> 00:23:54,408
Everything regarding to audio can now be rendered in high quality.

256
00:23:56,069 --> 00:24:07,877
I remember feeling that all in the in-air-de-ca-tion, in-de-ca-tion?

257
00:24:07,977 --> 00:24:08,678
In-air-de-ca-tion.

258
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:09,458
Ha ha ha.

259
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,620
Were removed.

260
00:24:14,342 --> 00:24:17,884
Catching also ameliorated in quality.

261
00:24:19,802 --> 00:24:23,643
including a seamless reaction to user input.

262
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:35,206
As a result, the number of pre-rendered movies decreased.

263
00:24:37,247 --> 00:24:41,208
Sound effects were required to be realistic

264
00:24:41,548 --> 00:24:45,949
and to be synchronized with the user input.

265
00:24:49,367 --> 00:24:58,572
Due to the quantity, physical simulations and procedure

266
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:05,015
techniques were quickly incorporated and added.

267
00:25:07,877 --> 00:25:13,280
We were able to use in-game material in cut scenes.

268
00:25:14,957 --> 00:25:21,262
somewhat decreasing the production steps.

269
00:25:22,803 --> 00:25:32,971
However, technical issues drastically became more complex

270
00:25:33,071 --> 00:25:37,975
to manage the copious number of audio materials.

271
00:25:39,696 --> 00:25:42,498
Cut scenes and ambient sound.

272
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:48,673
Layouts used to be done by non-audio sections of the team.

273
00:25:51,494 --> 00:25:57,517
But with the enhancement of game development tools,

274
00:25:58,638 --> 00:25:59,058
not tools.

275
00:25:59,538 --> 00:25:59,759
Tools.

276
00:25:59,779 --> 00:26:00,019
Yeah.

277
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:04,801
These processes are now concluded

278
00:26:05,642 --> 00:26:07,683
within the audio section.

279
00:26:08,663 --> 00:26:12,906
This extremely helps in the brush up phase,

280
00:26:14,427 --> 00:26:18,610
where the audio sections can make the modification

281
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,650
at their hands.

282
00:26:21,151 --> 00:26:26,615
Voices counting in digits of tens of thousands

283
00:26:29,897 --> 00:26:34,600
managed in a database named Mormul in Square Enix.

284
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:52,204
It is distinguished from the past workflow that Zain cleaning hardware power resulted in increasing production costs.

285
00:26:53,885 --> 00:27:03,868
And developers have focused on decreasing the total cost with their technology.

286
00:27:05,944 --> 00:27:08,246
leading to higher quality in-ear.

287
00:27:09,767 --> 00:27:16,051
Also, multi-channel environment is getting popular

288
00:27:16,171 --> 00:27:18,693
in most parts of the game market.

289
00:27:20,254 --> 00:27:27,219
But in Japan, the market share of surround audio system

290
00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:31,182
is not as big as it is around.

291
00:27:32,424 --> 00:27:45,555
So in Final Fantasy XIII Trilogy, we have realized a hybrid architecture to achieve high quality in both stealth and surround.

292
00:27:58,626 --> 00:28:05,188
So PlayStation 4 is coming up, so someone please do something in the next year.

293
00:28:12,671 --> 00:28:19,774
So we've seen the history right now, and we're going to go into the present and see what's

294
00:28:19,814 --> 00:28:25,097
going on right now. I'll break down the JRPG audio into three categories. Music, sound

295
00:28:25,157 --> 00:28:26,397
effects, and dialogues.

296
00:28:28,024 --> 00:28:30,646
and how they're done and how the technology supports it.

297
00:28:30,666 --> 00:28:35,231
There you go.

298
00:28:35,251 --> 00:28:36,091
So first is music.

299
00:28:36,311 --> 00:28:37,513
I'm sure everyone loves the music.

300
00:28:38,513 --> 00:28:40,595
So Western games has the tendency to focus

301
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:43,818
on creating the realistic and persuading virtual world

302
00:28:44,459 --> 00:28:46,861
to bring the user into the game, into the world.

303
00:28:47,942 --> 00:28:51,485
In contrast, JRPGs focus how deep they can bring

304
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:54,628
to the story, not like the world or the game.

305
00:28:56,172 --> 00:28:58,393
So many JRPG users cannot stop playing the game

306
00:28:58,473 --> 00:28:59,094
once they start it.

307
00:28:59,374 --> 00:29:02,116
This is because JRPGs are created so that the users

308
00:29:02,216 --> 00:29:03,897
always want to know what's gonna happen

309
00:29:03,917 --> 00:29:05,818
in the next phase, to say.

310
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,421
So music in JRPGs has a role to induce

311
00:29:10,441 --> 00:29:11,782
the user's mind and thought train.

312
00:29:12,843 --> 00:29:14,704
By elaborating the character's emotions,

313
00:29:15,585 --> 00:29:17,706
it allows the players to pull and empathize

314
00:29:18,026 --> 00:29:18,827
with the characters.

315
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:25,611
Okay, here are some characteristics of JRPG music.

316
00:29:26,696 --> 00:29:28,917
Some kind of music is constantly played in JRPGs,

317
00:29:28,997 --> 00:29:29,998
like Yajimasa mentioned.

318
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:33,019
This is Siena's style in Japan.

319
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,321
There are many fans of the computers themselves,

320
00:29:37,761 --> 00:29:42,883
and as a result, the soundtracks becomes enormous.

321
00:29:43,043 --> 00:29:44,764
We often hear from the users abroad

322
00:29:44,844 --> 00:29:46,925
that this style is nothing near reality.

323
00:29:47,045 --> 00:29:48,286
Do you agree?

324
00:29:51,227 --> 00:29:53,268
But I believe this is definitely an effective method

325
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:55,229
to bring the user into the fantasy.

326
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:01,023
So various genre music like techno, rock, or vocal songs

327
00:30:01,063 --> 00:30:03,005
is used to build up the anticipation of the game,

328
00:30:03,165 --> 00:30:06,828
but a grandiose orchestral sound is almost always used.

329
00:30:08,469 --> 00:30:10,351
At the stable scenes of JRPGs,

330
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:14,274
orchestral music is used to meet the player's expectation,

331
00:30:14,635 --> 00:30:16,336
leading to deeper immersion into the scene.

332
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:18,658
Well, somehow this has been the tradition.

333
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:24,803
Also, the percentage of emotional music tracks

334
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:26,664
is high in JRPGs.

335
00:30:27,614 --> 00:30:30,255
like short psychological sounds like in the Western games,

336
00:30:30,275 --> 00:30:31,356
they're almost never used.

337
00:30:32,377 --> 00:30:36,299
And instead, melody is the most important thing in JRPGs.

338
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:43,582
And digging deeper into the music,

339
00:30:44,023 --> 00:30:46,544
so we have different genre of game musics.

340
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:48,745
One is the cutscene music.

341
00:30:52,207 --> 00:30:53,348
That's going to create the empathy

342
00:30:53,368 --> 00:30:54,568
between the characters and users.

343
00:30:56,027 --> 00:30:58,109
And we have the level exploration music.

344
00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:01,071
And we call it field music or field BGM.

345
00:31:02,672 --> 00:31:04,034
In this phase, a boy and music he

346
00:31:04,054 --> 00:31:06,515
uses to connect a part of the story to another.

347
00:31:09,798 --> 00:31:10,999
And we have the battle music.

348
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:15,122
This is the favorite of many JRPG music fans.

349
00:31:21,307 --> 00:31:24,009
So there's different music for different maps.

350
00:31:24,972 --> 00:31:26,413
different music for boss monsters.

351
00:31:27,713 --> 00:31:30,833
And right now, the interactive music has came into the battle

352
00:31:30,853 --> 00:31:31,954
music in JRPGs.

353
00:31:32,394 --> 00:31:36,735
And now we switch between, depending on how the player is

354
00:31:36,795 --> 00:31:38,795
winning or losing in the battle teams.

355
00:31:41,456 --> 00:31:43,796
This is going to reduce the redundancy in

356
00:31:43,816 --> 00:31:44,476
battles somewhat.

357
00:31:49,097 --> 00:31:53,038
So nowhere in the JRPGs the music stops, except for the

358
00:31:53,098 --> 00:31:53,918
now loading screen.

359
00:31:57,948 --> 00:32:00,170
And because of that, JRPGs have evolved

360
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,351
to make this more natural.

361
00:32:03,372 --> 00:32:08,076
And I mentioned a bit when I talked about Bell music,

362
00:32:08,116 --> 00:32:09,797
but the Bell music interactivity changes.

363
00:32:10,397 --> 00:32:12,239
And I would like to introduce how it's done

364
00:32:12,259 --> 00:32:13,400
in Final Fantasy.

365
00:32:14,801 --> 00:32:15,581
And it's called...

366
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:19,624
We call it multi-layer music transition system.

367
00:32:22,406 --> 00:32:23,667
Well, here's an example of how...

368
00:32:24,508 --> 00:32:26,209
Here are some examples of the transitions.

369
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:26,670
Like...

370
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:34,465
Fueled music, crossfading, seamlessly turning to battle music, coming back to the fuel music

371
00:32:34,826 --> 00:32:42,632
and from where it left off, and players are enthused by the melody of music, excited to

372
00:32:42,652 --> 00:32:43,893
know what's going to happen next.

373
00:32:47,416 --> 00:32:52,520
So in the layers, according to layer data, music commands that are done automatically

374
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:55,802
to crossfade, pause, or jump, and always in the track.

375
00:33:02,912 --> 00:33:05,533
Okay, because there are some cases that the previous music

376
00:33:05,573 --> 00:33:07,694
must be continued from where it left off,

377
00:33:09,975 --> 00:33:12,716
number of layers times two tracks are always available.

378
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,877
So each of the six, in this case,

379
00:33:14,957 --> 00:33:16,937
so three layers times two,

380
00:33:18,818 --> 00:33:21,579
are synchronized and controlled with play,

381
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,981
fade, jump, or pause, depending on the command.

382
00:33:26,842 --> 00:33:29,763
And this behavior is defined by the game designers

383
00:33:29,923 --> 00:33:30,923
or the sound designers.

384
00:33:33,313 --> 00:33:36,614
And programs like us just provides the environment and the tools.

385
00:33:38,554 --> 00:33:42,155
What's important here is how the player here received the change in melody.

386
00:33:42,775 --> 00:33:47,676
By changing the melody appropriately, the players understand what's going on in the

387
00:33:47,696 --> 00:33:51,257
game right now, and brought deeper into the story.

388
00:33:52,017 --> 00:33:55,738
So I brought a video of an example of the music.

389
00:33:56,838 --> 00:33:57,458
Here it is.

390
00:33:57,478 --> 00:34:02,579
I lost the cursor.

391
00:34:07,309 --> 00:34:08,691
It's over. From the beginning.

392
00:34:53,851 --> 00:34:54,091
Price.

393
00:35:19,979 --> 00:35:24,520
So that was one minute, but we had the field BGM, the enemy

394
00:35:25,181 --> 00:35:28,342
getting closer, field BGM, and back to the normal field BGM,

395
00:35:28,802 --> 00:35:31,183
into the bell music, and to the fanfare.

396
00:35:31,203 --> 00:35:32,124
That was one minute.

397
00:35:38,146 --> 00:35:38,566
Going on.

398
00:35:38,967 --> 00:35:40,087
Next are the sound effects.

399
00:35:41,068 --> 00:35:42,808
So the basic idea of sound effects

400
00:35:42,948 --> 00:35:44,229
are the same all over the world.

401
00:35:44,829 --> 00:35:47,370
And they are made to make the world much more persuading.

402
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,743
As the visual aspect of the game advanced through the ages, so did the sound effects.

403
00:35:53,544 --> 00:36:00,269
And you may think that there are many differences between JRPGs and games in the Western world,

404
00:36:00,529 --> 00:36:03,632
but some of these are something you will never see in others.

405
00:36:03,652 --> 00:36:10,497
Okay, here are the characteristics.

406
00:36:10,658 --> 00:36:12,179
First of them are interface sounds.

407
00:36:13,194 --> 00:36:14,955
That's very complicated in JRPGs.

408
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:17,417
And we call them the system sound effects, actually.

409
00:36:17,937 --> 00:36:20,139
And they count over 200 per game.

410
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,061
And sound designers need to control their behavior

411
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:26,423
while various UI controls are being done.

412
00:36:26,443 --> 00:36:30,185
So here, the players unconsciously

413
00:36:30,225 --> 00:36:34,188
discover the part of the world in the menu UIs,

414
00:36:35,028 --> 00:36:35,809
not just in the game.

415
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:40,392
And next is the design of the ambient sounds.

416
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:44,927
And music is always being played in JRPGs,

417
00:36:45,607 --> 00:36:46,507
as I just explained.

418
00:36:48,148 --> 00:36:50,029
And ambient sound must be effective enough

419
00:36:50,069 --> 00:36:50,809
within the music.

420
00:36:52,189 --> 00:36:54,130
So sound designers meticulously strive

421
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:58,051
to connect the sound to the object on the levels, waterfalls,

422
00:36:58,992 --> 00:37:00,972
bonfires, waves, and whatever.

423
00:37:02,873 --> 00:37:04,213
During the passive part of music,

424
00:37:04,494 --> 00:37:06,534
ambient sound is going to increase their presence.

425
00:37:07,094 --> 00:37:10,856
And players will hear the layout sound of the ambience.

426
00:37:13,653 --> 00:37:14,813
as they see on the screen.

427
00:37:16,373 --> 00:37:20,794
I think it's interesting that the wallop is in Western games

428
00:37:20,914 --> 00:37:22,435
or so done like this.

429
00:37:22,735 --> 00:37:26,115
But instead in JRPGs, we have wallops just being looped.

430
00:37:29,376 --> 00:37:33,097
And recently, to adapt to the countless amount of sound

431
00:37:33,137 --> 00:37:35,757
effects and increasing amount of sound effects,

432
00:37:36,317 --> 00:37:38,558
automations were both triggering and generating

433
00:37:38,618 --> 00:37:42,378
sound and runtimes being done in the game consoles.

434
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:47,641
In Square Enix, sound effects are starting to be generated and triggered automatically,

435
00:37:49,001 --> 00:37:52,983
even without any designers or game scripts working on.

436
00:37:56,984 --> 00:38:00,925
This makes the variety of such sound possible without increasing the manpower.

437
00:38:04,206 --> 00:38:06,007
So here are some technologies.

438
00:38:06,727 --> 00:38:10,988
If you went all the technology of sound effects, it's going to take a few hours, so I'm going

439
00:38:11,028 --> 00:38:11,688
to pick up a two.

440
00:38:13,094 --> 00:38:14,095
Out of the many?

441
00:38:17,777 --> 00:38:18,118
Okay.

442
00:38:18,938 --> 00:38:21,560
This is a part of a list of the interface sounds

443
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,841
in Final Fantasy XIII.

444
00:38:24,082 --> 00:38:25,303
You can see a lot.

445
00:38:25,623 --> 00:38:26,984
I'm sorry it's in Japanese, but

446
00:38:28,685 --> 00:38:30,166
I'm sure you can count the numbers.

447
00:38:30,186 --> 00:38:32,688
Okay.

448
00:38:33,389 --> 00:38:36,491
So in JRPGs, a setting interface for equipment,

449
00:38:36,551 --> 00:38:39,293
parameters, magic, and whatever that's in the game.

450
00:38:39,945 --> 00:38:40,846
exist independently.

451
00:38:41,346 --> 00:38:43,186
And not only the menus.

452
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,768
Selectable interfaces everywhere in JRPGs,

453
00:38:50,768 --> 00:38:52,409
like the battles you've just seen.

454
00:38:53,649 --> 00:38:55,370
So the sound effects becomes the hint

455
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,530
on what the user is doing right now.

456
00:38:59,031 --> 00:39:01,071
You may think that having so many different sound effects,

457
00:39:01,331 --> 00:39:02,632
I just counted 200, right?

458
00:39:04,212 --> 00:39:06,733
On different interfaces will cause confusion.

459
00:39:07,499 --> 00:39:17,288
But these are carefully designed by the sound designers so that the sound effects in the same category, like selecting sounds, cancelling sound, share the same characteristics.

460
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:28,198
But even when the design, even with that design, sound designers cannot control what the user is going to do in the menu UIs.

461
00:39:28,818 --> 00:39:32,321
So sound designers can program the behavior of system sounds.

462
00:39:35,532 --> 00:39:38,434
With these designs, we create the interface of JRPGs

463
00:39:38,814 --> 00:39:40,055
to be fun to listen to.

464
00:39:42,437 --> 00:39:45,099
This is actually where some sound designers, like Ajima-san,

465
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:46,960
spends most of their time in.

466
00:39:51,504 --> 00:39:54,186
One of the latest technology in sound effects

467
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:57,048
are the procedural sound triggering and generators.

468
00:39:58,172 --> 00:40:00,694
Five years ago in GDC, I was actually introduced MASDS,

469
00:40:03,898 --> 00:40:06,180
Automatic Sound Triggering System for Character Motion.

470
00:40:07,721 --> 00:40:09,303
Other than that, we have Automatic Triggering

471
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:12,787
for Passing Object, where MASDS is used to compute

472
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,969
the best fitting sound for the passing object.

473
00:40:16,471 --> 00:40:18,973
Reverb parameters change in special moves and battles,

474
00:40:19,494 --> 00:40:20,995
and more is being researched right now.

475
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:25,892
Also, runtime generators are under research as well.

476
00:40:26,653 --> 00:40:31,536
Some of them include crashing sounds of rocks, explosions,

477
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:34,698
footsteps, weather, car engines, and more, I think.

478
00:40:37,841 --> 00:40:39,982
The benefit of these technologies done in-house

479
00:40:40,002 --> 00:40:44,245
that we have native application tools, visual debugger

480
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,706
implemented in the game system.

481
00:40:46,607 --> 00:40:49,889
The audio programs like us in the company.

482
00:40:51,179 --> 00:40:54,222
always strive for high usability for these tools.

483
00:40:55,383 --> 00:40:58,525
So, sound effects, I think, are where the technology

484
00:40:58,925 --> 00:40:59,666
prospers the most.

485
00:41:01,067 --> 00:41:04,950
And the newest technologies, like Final Fantasy XV,

486
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:07,232
or Kingdom Hearts 3, that's being developed right now.

487
00:41:07,252 --> 00:41:13,717
Okay, last of the three are the dialogues.

488
00:41:14,618 --> 00:41:17,000
Dialogues are the youngest of the three categories,

489
00:41:17,921 --> 00:41:19,582
as Yajimesen mentioned in the history section.

490
00:41:20,822 --> 00:41:23,764
This was not used until the media storage was large enough.

491
00:41:24,725 --> 00:41:27,987
And as the storage size grew, naturally, the number of voice

492
00:41:28,007 --> 00:41:29,147
files increased as well.

493
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,350
Today, with all the characters having the voice of their own,

494
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:36,792
it gives more sense of existence of the characters,

495
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:38,873
that they're here with the players.

496
00:41:44,997 --> 00:41:46,918
There are many distinct characteristics here,

497
00:41:46,998 --> 00:41:49,900
but all of them connect to one word, characterization.

498
00:41:51,098 --> 00:41:56,282
In English dialogues, dialects are used to show a character's background, like where they're from.

499
00:41:57,483 --> 00:42:00,866
But Japanese voices are also used in a standard dialect.

500
00:42:03,148 --> 00:42:06,250
What is special about Japanese dialogues are there are many play on words,

501
00:42:07,151 --> 00:42:13,696
like the special end of the sentence word, like Kupo in Mugo in Final Fantasy.

502
00:42:14,077 --> 00:42:15,778
I brought some voices here in English.

503
00:42:16,759 --> 00:42:19,321
Who else? I'm always here for you, Kupo!

504
00:42:21,008 --> 00:42:22,068
He sure is, Kupo.

505
00:42:22,688 --> 00:42:25,749
He's working to create his very own new universe, Kupo.

506
00:42:27,009 --> 00:42:29,830
I'll be right here cheering for you with all my might, Kupo.

507
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:34,171
So I'm sure you noticed that Kupo is coming out from nowhere.

508
00:42:36,371 --> 00:42:38,091
Makes some kind of sense in Japanese,

509
00:42:38,111 --> 00:42:39,772
but it makes no sense in English, right?

510
00:42:43,213 --> 00:42:46,433
So I'm sure the localize team is having lots of trouble for this.

511
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,720
And, okay, second one is the battle voices.

512
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,221
When the player attacks, gets damaged,

513
00:42:54,281 --> 00:42:57,162
or have some reaction in the battles,

514
00:42:57,562 --> 00:43:00,083
some kind of voice gets played in Japanese games.

515
00:43:01,724 --> 00:43:02,684
When this is missing,

516
00:43:03,005 --> 00:43:05,746
most Japanese users feel disappointed.

517
00:43:06,306 --> 00:43:08,707
In recent scenes, this is getting more sophisticated,

518
00:43:08,807 --> 00:43:12,308
actually, to interact with the current,

519
00:43:12,328 --> 00:43:13,569
what's going on in the battle right now.

520
00:43:15,329 --> 00:43:15,750
Oh, I'm sorry.

521
00:43:18,134 --> 00:43:22,277
Okay, the other characteristics of JRPG dialogues

522
00:43:22,397 --> 00:43:24,159
is the voice actors and actresses.

523
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,181
Mainly due to the popularity in the animes,

524
00:43:29,463 --> 00:43:33,206
the actors and actresses have many fans of their own.

525
00:43:33,886 --> 00:43:35,768
And actually, one of the reasons for the users

526
00:43:35,808 --> 00:43:38,590
to buy a game in Japan is because they want to hear

527
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:40,571
the voice actor and actresses in the game.

528
00:43:40,591 --> 00:43:44,915
Okay, so each of the actors have

529
00:43:45,175 --> 00:43:46,516
their own characteristics as well.

530
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:52,856
So this has a great effect on game characters as well,

531
00:43:53,357 --> 00:43:54,057
when they're voiced.

532
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,987
This, okay, and whoops.

533
00:44:03,549 --> 00:44:04,390
Okay, I'm gonna calm down.

534
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:19,896
Sorry, I'm losing my courses.

535
00:44:20,076 --> 00:44:20,977
OK, what's next?

536
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,821
OK, and of course, we have to mention number.

537
00:44:26,822 --> 00:44:30,045
In JRPGs, the main characters are very passive

538
00:44:30,085 --> 00:44:30,886
in their speech.

539
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:34,369
And that's going to increase the number of the lines in

540
00:44:34,849 --> 00:44:35,390
NPCs.

541
00:44:40,234 --> 00:44:43,377
So the NPCs are those who are going to actually guide the

542
00:44:43,397 --> 00:44:43,897
storyline.

543
00:44:45,047 --> 00:44:51,151
This implies that the numbers of lines including NPCs is copious, very copious, compared to

544
00:44:51,211 --> 00:44:52,812
any other genre of games.

545
00:44:54,013 --> 00:44:59,857
To keep the work for dialogues fast and low in cost, Database tool that allows multi-user

546
00:44:59,877 --> 00:45:01,118
simultaneous editing can be used.

547
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:07,843
So I just mentioned some of the technologies, but I'm going to go into the technologies

548
00:45:07,883 --> 00:45:08,603
of the dialogues.

549
00:45:11,085 --> 00:45:12,766
So Database, what we call MooMoo.

550
00:45:14,377 --> 00:45:29,129
It's used to streamline massive amount of lines, generating ID labels for script files,

551
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:36,876
linking audio, subtitles, translation code, has dictionary management functionalities,

552
00:45:38,097 --> 00:45:41,800
and has simultaneous editing and viewing support.

553
00:45:43,667 --> 00:45:45,389
There was a session two years ago about this,

554
00:45:45,769 --> 00:45:47,370
so you can check it out in the bold.

555
00:45:53,135 --> 00:45:56,597
Just like the system SES sound effects I showed earlier,

556
00:45:57,078 --> 00:46:00,140
battle voices, too, are categorized with a killsie

557
00:46:00,761 --> 00:46:03,143
and use battery control system to speak

558
00:46:03,183 --> 00:46:05,685
the line that matches what's going on in the battle.

559
00:46:07,506 --> 00:46:09,328
For this, even the short excerpts,

560
00:46:09,408 --> 00:46:12,550
such as yeah or to see in Japanese games.

561
00:46:13,478 --> 00:46:17,859
have made very many versions to express the state of mind

562
00:46:18,039 --> 00:46:18,739
for the characters.

563
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:22,160
In addition, there are longer lines

564
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,700
to yell out the special moves in Japanese games.

565
00:46:27,521 --> 00:46:30,481
Obviously, this will create a long list of battle

566
00:46:30,501 --> 00:46:32,562
voices to record.

567
00:46:32,582 --> 00:46:37,022
OK, so we went through the three categories.

568
00:46:37,462 --> 00:46:39,063
And let's see them all happen in the game.

569
00:46:45,101 --> 00:46:45,522
Into?

570
00:46:45,542 --> 00:46:46,865
I'm ready. Are you?

571
00:47:37,402 --> 00:47:38,252
Time to repent.

572
00:48:20,656 --> 00:48:23,317
Thanks for watching!

573
00:48:56,342 --> 00:48:58,623
I've got something important to discuss with you.

574
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:28,317
Oops, I bumped into something there.

575
00:49:53,447 --> 00:49:55,268
So as a quick overview of the categories,

576
00:49:55,788 --> 00:49:58,050
the music is in charge of players' emotions.

577
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:01,292
And the sound effects are there to create the environment.

578
00:50:01,632 --> 00:50:04,714
And the voice plays a huge role in the sense of existence

579
00:50:04,754 --> 00:50:05,655
and characterization.

580
00:50:06,675 --> 00:50:10,218
Well, with that said, that's all for what

581
00:50:10,238 --> 00:50:11,599
we have in the present time.

582
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,381
But what's going to happen in the future?

583
00:50:14,401 --> 00:50:21,185
I believe the player is going to be more active.

584
00:50:22,816 --> 00:50:30,020
where I mean passive players are those who just receive the story of the RPG.

585
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:42,987
The players will not just read the story but actively make action to go find the story they are looking for.

586
00:50:44,448 --> 00:50:44,888
Because...

587
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:57,328
Western games are many steps ahead in satisfying what the users think should be collected in the virtual world.

588
00:50:58,549 --> 00:51:10,339
I'm sure the Japanese games will be following that current without losing the identity of JRPGs.

589
00:51:11,578 --> 00:51:17,299
But it is difficult to change the story ending in JRPGs.

590
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:22,681
So the path to the ending is going

591
00:51:22,801 --> 00:51:25,941
to be adjusted according to user actions.

592
00:51:27,782 --> 00:51:32,603
Audio will not change drastically as a result.

593
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:38,545
But with the change in the games.

594
00:51:40,201 --> 00:51:44,984
It is going to induce the users to make more action

595
00:51:45,124 --> 00:51:50,148
in the way each of the players want to happen in the game.

596
00:51:51,849 --> 00:51:52,169
Nagaji?

597
00:51:59,014 --> 00:52:00,795
We have the end conclusion, so.

598
00:52:01,508 --> 00:52:04,249
So what's the difference between the game in and out of Japan?

599
00:52:04,469 --> 00:52:06,731
And we believe it's freedom against the rules.

600
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:09,872
Given the history and the role of audio categories in games,

601
00:52:10,653 --> 00:52:14,815
we say that JRPGs are rendered in such a way

602
00:52:14,855 --> 00:52:17,116
that the players will strongly empathize

603
00:52:17,136 --> 00:52:18,557
with the characters and the story.

604
00:52:19,477 --> 00:52:21,318
From the denotation of the role-playing game,

605
00:52:22,179 --> 00:52:25,741
the Western games are much closer to the original meaning.

606
00:52:27,422 --> 00:52:30,323
In the Western games, I always feel that the concrete stage,

607
00:52:30,343 --> 00:52:30,923
the world.

608
00:52:31,536 --> 00:52:33,157
for the players to freely play around

609
00:52:33,177 --> 00:52:34,857
is a pivotal aspect in them.

610
00:52:36,638 --> 00:52:38,979
It is common that completing the missions

611
00:52:39,019 --> 00:52:42,940
will reveal a story, but the gameplay of the mission itself

612
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:46,502
is the main focus and the story is more in the background

613
00:52:47,202 --> 00:52:48,643
and the reinforcement.

614
00:52:50,023 --> 00:52:53,345
Compared to it, JRPGs have missions to pursue a story.

615
00:52:54,225 --> 00:52:56,546
Scenario is the main experience for the players

616
00:52:57,206 --> 00:52:58,687
and gameplay exists to support it.

617
00:52:59,087 --> 00:52:59,727
It's the opposite.

618
00:53:01,931 --> 00:53:05,192
For example, you're playing the game and you see a door,

619
00:53:05,212 --> 00:53:06,753
and it has a doorknob.

620
00:53:07,673 --> 00:53:10,915
And you're going to expect that that's going to open, right?

621
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:14,376
But not in JRPGs, because it doesn't matter.

622
00:53:14,396 --> 00:53:15,857
It doesn't matter.

623
00:53:15,977 --> 00:53:17,958
The story doesn't change if you can open it or not.

624
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:24,481
And there are always such traditional cliches,

625
00:53:25,141 --> 00:53:27,802
scenarios in JRPGs, how the characters collect

626
00:53:27,882 --> 00:53:30,283
information, character gets stronger,

627
00:53:30,684 --> 00:53:31,684
and defeating the boss monster.

628
00:53:32,677 --> 00:53:36,460
This of course decreased the degree of freedom in JRPGs,

629
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:41,483
but users are more, users want the cliche.

630
00:53:44,005 --> 00:53:46,306
Another way to put this is Western games,

631
00:53:46,346 --> 00:53:48,848
the player is the character himself,

632
00:53:49,508 --> 00:53:52,631
but in JRPGs, the player is someone who experiences

633
00:53:52,651 --> 00:53:54,512
the story with the characters.

634
00:53:57,174 --> 00:53:58,975
I hope now you see why we kept mentioning

635
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:00,576
like reading a book or seeing a movie.

636
00:54:04,853 --> 00:54:08,014
And finally, we are always looking at these differences

637
00:54:08,074 --> 00:54:10,715
when we develop games for the world

638
00:54:12,195 --> 00:54:15,476
and see how we can make the game enjoyable for everyone

639
00:54:15,556 --> 00:54:16,176
on the planet.

640
00:54:17,636 --> 00:54:19,817
Today, we can discuss the ideas about how we can

641
00:54:20,057 --> 00:54:21,417
make the game more enjoyable.

642
00:54:21,557 --> 00:54:24,878
So we're looking for more and more opportunity

643
00:54:24,898 --> 00:54:29,339
to discuss with everyone here, the creators

644
00:54:29,479 --> 00:54:34,140
from all over the world to refine JRPGs and other games.

645
00:54:35,132 --> 00:54:38,033
to for everyone in the planet to enjoy.

646
00:54:38,053 --> 00:54:48,897
Hey, thank you so much for coming here, and if you have any question…

647
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,961
Thank you.

648
00:54:57,761 --> 00:54:59,742
If you have any questions, please come up at the mic.

649
00:55:03,924 --> 00:55:04,004
No?

650
00:55:08,131 --> 00:55:17,043
So when you guys are working on sound effects for JRPGs, are there any kind of standards

651
00:55:17,123 --> 00:55:21,830
or rules you go by, because they all seem to have a very similar sound, like weapon

652
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:23,653
attacks, monsters, menu UI?

653
00:55:24,902 --> 00:55:26,183
So what's your process for that?

654
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:27,203
Process for it?

655
00:55:27,544 --> 00:55:29,344
Please, can you say that again?

656
00:55:29,384 --> 00:55:31,786
Just JRPG sound effects in general,

657
00:55:31,826 --> 00:55:33,907
like the more kind of exaggerated ones

658
00:55:33,927 --> 00:55:35,227
that you don't get in Western games.

659
00:55:35,988 --> 00:55:38,389
You know, like the really meaty sword sounds

660
00:55:38,409 --> 00:55:39,249
when you hit things,

661
00:55:39,349 --> 00:55:42,651
and all the crazy explosions during special attacks.

662
00:55:44,412 --> 00:55:47,493
So what's the process for the ideas behind it?

663
00:55:47,554 --> 00:55:49,194
For like creating the sounds.

664
00:55:49,234 --> 00:55:50,135
Creating a sound for JRPGs.

665
00:55:50,155 --> 00:55:51,515
Say you need to go out and record something,

666
00:55:51,536 --> 00:55:52,216
what would you record?

667
00:55:54,204 --> 00:55:57,749
In Japanese RPCs, it's quite different from the games from overseas, right?

668
00:55:57,769 --> 00:55:58,230
What's different?

669
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:00,053
Yeah, it's different.

670
00:56:00,093 --> 00:56:03,578
I'd like to know what you're thinking about when you're making it.

671
00:56:03,598 --> 00:56:04,279
What am I thinking about?

672
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:15,433
That's a question beyond our expectations.

673
00:56:15,714 --> 00:56:20,618
I think that, despite being in the US and Japan,

674
00:56:20,658 --> 00:56:21,779
our thoughts are the same,

675
00:56:21,819 --> 00:56:24,881
but the culture of the country we live in has changed a lot.

676
00:56:24,901 --> 00:56:26,483
That's a very characteristic of Japan.

677
00:56:26,543 --> 00:56:29,765
The reason is that Final Fantasy is now up to FFXIV,

678
00:56:29,826 --> 00:56:32,408
and it's been around for almost 30 years.

679
00:56:32,448 --> 00:56:33,429
So, in our minds,

680
00:56:33,449 --> 00:56:36,031
we feel that Final Fantasy should be like this.

681
00:56:40,651 --> 00:56:41,191
It's very old.

682
00:56:41,251 --> 00:56:44,072
If it's Dragon Quest, it's the same as Dragon Quest, it's been around for 30 years.

683
00:56:44,132 --> 00:56:45,513
It has a history of around 30 years.

684
00:56:46,113 --> 00:56:48,574
In the case of RPG, it's been around for a long time,

685
00:56:48,594 --> 00:56:49,955
so there's a little bit of a problem.

686
00:57:10,937 --> 00:57:18,062
So he's basing his sound effects on the previous Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest and building on it.

687
00:57:18,423 --> 00:57:19,524
Does that answer your question?

688
00:57:20,724 --> 00:57:21,105
Good enough.

689
00:57:25,508 --> 00:57:31,672
So a lot of Western users tend to get a little...

690
00:57:34,514 --> 00:57:35,035
Let me start over.

691
00:57:37,054 --> 00:57:46,141
JRPG battles often feature a sort of dialogue repetition after a while, like there's a single

692
00:57:46,281 --> 00:57:51,005
sound file for a special attack callout, for example, or there are a...

693
00:57:53,447 --> 00:57:59,135
a grand total of three I'm-getting-ready-to-attack voice clips.

694
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:04,283
And these tend to repeat quite often over the course of an entire game.

695
00:58:04,343 --> 00:58:08,289
And I know that a lot of Western users tend to get...

696
00:58:09,563 --> 00:58:12,125
quite tired of that after a while.

697
00:58:12,165 --> 00:58:15,447
Do you often take that into consideration

698
00:58:15,507 --> 00:58:18,409
when trying to do voiceover design?

699
00:58:18,569 --> 00:58:22,771
And is the perception of that the same in Japan?

700
00:58:22,831 --> 00:58:25,113
Or do you think that's a bit differently received?

701
00:58:26,193 --> 00:58:32,657
Or how do you handle sort of voiceover repetition fatigue?

702
00:58:33,518 --> 00:58:35,439
So the question is, how do you

703
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:41,772
How do you handle voice over repetition fatigue?

704
00:58:41,792 --> 00:58:43,873
How do you avoid voice over repetition fatigue, right?

705
00:58:44,053 --> 00:58:44,313
Yeah.

706
00:58:46,455 --> 00:58:46,755
OK.

707
00:58:46,875 --> 00:58:51,378
In Japan, if you don't speak, people say you're lonely because you don't have anything.

708
00:58:51,398 --> 00:58:53,959
But overseas, they say the opposite.

709
00:58:53,999 --> 00:58:54,460
Let's reduce it.

710
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:13,292
So in Japan, many users want to hear the voices.

711
00:59:14,213 --> 00:59:16,535
But the Western users are the opposite, right?

712
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:18,296
They don't want much dialogues happening.

713
00:59:20,077 --> 00:59:22,359
So he's saying that he's going to decrease

714
00:59:22,379 --> 00:59:25,362
the number of dialogues in the next title.

715
00:59:26,502 --> 00:59:26,883
Oh.

716
00:59:27,023 --> 00:59:27,904
Oh.

717
00:59:28,124 --> 00:59:29,124
OK, then.

718
00:59:30,486 --> 00:59:31,066
I can guess.

719
00:59:31,146 --> 00:59:31,486
I can.

720
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:36,210
Hello and thank you.

721
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:37,270
Hi.

722
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:44,713
I wonder if you could talk a little bit about pitch and musical pitch for sound effects

723
00:59:44,753 --> 00:59:45,173
design.

724
00:59:45,493 --> 00:59:45,793
Pitch?

725
00:59:46,173 --> 00:59:52,735
Yes, because it seems like in many modern Final Fantasy games that I play, there is

726
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:59,578
a lot of pitch matching for sound effects, especially with music.

727
01:00:00,898 --> 01:00:01,338
Sometimes

728
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:07,165
It showed up in the last battles scene that we saw with Lightning there.

729
01:00:08,426 --> 01:00:13,168
And often that's difficult if you have a lot of different sound effects

730
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:17,471
or a lot of different types of music to match sound effects with.

731
01:00:17,931 --> 01:00:20,952
And I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about pitch

732
01:00:21,212 --> 01:00:23,113
and that importance for sound effects design.

733
01:00:23,803 --> 01:00:26,044
So the question is, how do you match sound effects pitch

734
01:00:26,525 --> 01:00:27,365
with music, right?

735
01:00:27,485 --> 01:00:29,747
Well, making decisions on that, because it

736
01:00:29,807 --> 01:00:33,029
seems like there are many sound effects there that are pitched,

737
01:00:33,509 --> 01:00:37,532
where similar sound effects in a Western game

738
01:00:37,952 --> 01:00:40,074
would not be pitched by design.

739
01:00:40,194 --> 01:00:40,554
I see.

740
01:00:41,695 --> 01:00:43,336
For Japanese sound effects,

741
01:00:43,576 --> 01:00:44,417
if there's pitch,

742
01:00:44,977 --> 01:00:49,000
and there's not too much West music that's like Western music,

743
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:49,620
how do you do it?

744
01:00:53,755 --> 01:00:54,595
What do you mean?

745
01:00:54,615 --> 01:01:02,277
I mean, there are music effects and sound effects that can be changed with the music,

746
01:01:02,558 --> 01:01:07,199
but if you think about the songwriter and the sound effects designer seeing whether that

747
01:01:07,219 --> 01:01:08,279
will hit or not.

748
01:01:17,942 --> 01:01:20,282
There are times when the music is quite monotonous,

749
01:01:20,823 --> 01:01:23,764
so we use sound effects to make it more melodious.

750
01:01:23,784 --> 01:01:26,425
The JRPG's characteristic is to make the overall music

751
01:01:26,465 --> 01:01:28,145
feel melodic throughout the game,

752
01:01:28,205 --> 01:01:30,046
so we make those sounds with that in mind.

753
01:01:30,106 --> 01:01:30,666
Melodic sounds?

754
01:01:30,686 --> 01:01:32,767
No, we make it sound melodic

755
01:01:32,847 --> 01:01:35,548
in the monotonous parts of the music,

756
01:01:35,968 --> 01:01:38,169
to make it sound more intense.

757
01:01:45,265 --> 01:01:57,310
MAKOTO TOSHIOKAWA Okay, how should I translate this?

758
01:02:01,052 --> 01:02:04,614
So, the melody is the important thing in JRPG, like we just explained, right?

759
01:02:04,954 --> 01:02:11,117
So, when the music gets kind of boring, the user wants something like some kind of melody

760
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:15,231
The sound effects are in charge of that.

761
01:02:16,572 --> 01:02:19,093
So and, well, of course, the composer and the sound

762
01:02:19,133 --> 01:02:20,974
there is a talk, so they don't crash.

763
01:02:21,134 --> 01:02:25,676
But I guess that's the reason.

764
01:02:27,637 --> 01:02:29,178
Why don't you do that overseas?

765
01:02:29,258 --> 01:02:32,420
It sounded like you said that the sound effects are like the

766
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:33,360
melody sometimes.

767
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:34,241
Yeah, sometimes.

768
01:02:34,261 --> 01:02:37,543
And he wants to know why that doesn't

769
01:02:37,583 --> 01:02:38,543
happen in the Western games.

770
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:49,972
It depends. Sometimes composers and sound effects designers are very separate.

771
01:02:51,192 --> 01:02:52,112
He says that's so boring.

772
01:02:52,132 --> 01:02:55,893
That's true, but sometimes they fight.

773
01:03:09,505 --> 01:03:13,207
The sound effect people often get into their head while planning.

774
01:03:13,267 --> 01:03:15,208
The side effects are interlinked is a characteristic.

775
01:03:15,268 --> 01:03:18,730
I think they people out there seem to do it as a professional professional,

776
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:20,271
but the result might be an excessive boundary.

777
01:03:23,842 --> 01:03:32,245
In Japan, sound design just doesn't work alone.

778
01:03:32,905 --> 01:03:36,487
So there's like the boards are not so ambiguous.

779
01:03:36,967 --> 01:03:39,748
And sound designers work with the planners, sound designers work with the composers.

780
01:03:40,688 --> 01:03:45,990
And sometimes the result is ambiguous too, but the result is this, the JRPGs.

781
01:03:47,551 --> 01:03:47,811
Thank you.

782
01:03:55,222 --> 01:03:55,303
Oh.

783
01:03:55,784 --> 01:03:56,045
Ah, OK.

784
01:03:56,065 --> 01:03:59,474
If you have any more questions, please go to the wrap-up room,

785
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:00,416
and we'll be there.

786
01:04:01,619 --> 01:04:02,201
Thank you so much.

787
01:04:02,401 --> 01:04:02,702
Thank you.
