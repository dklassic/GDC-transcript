1
00:00:03,201 --> 00:00:03,342
so

2
00:00:12,315 --> 00:00:17,937
So welcome everybody, thank you so much for joining me today for Define Your Audience Now, Not Later.

3
00:00:18,537 --> 00:00:25,200
My name is Cassie Hoagland, I'm currently working for Blizzard Entertainment, and I'm excited to bring this information to you today.

4
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:38,525
I have learned a lot at conferences and conventions over the last too many years, we'll say, and it's always a pleasure and a privilege to get the opportunity to give back and offer some information of my own.

5
00:00:40,595 --> 00:00:41,915
We'll take a moment for introductions.

6
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:43,235
Again, my name is Cassie.

7
00:00:43,616 --> 00:00:47,856
I play, make, and market games, and I have for about six years now.

8
00:00:48,476 --> 00:00:52,037
Majora's Mask is number one in my heart and in reality.

9
00:00:52,197 --> 00:00:54,177
This is a hill that I will die on.

10
00:00:56,018 --> 00:00:58,378
If you disagree, I'm just going to say it's OK to be wrong.

11
00:00:59,858 --> 00:01:01,539
Please put cheese on everything.

12
00:01:01,959 --> 00:01:03,359
It's just the way to live.

13
00:01:03,779 --> 00:01:07,420
And if you didn't like whatever you were eating with cheese, it was the wrong cheese.

14
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,480
It's not that fault.

15
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,400
It's not its fault.

16
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,882
And finally, this is kind of my philosophy for games.

17
00:01:12,942 --> 00:01:20,148
It's why I work in games, it's why I will continue to work in games, and it's helping you find your next favorite game.

18
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:33,638
I'm sure everyone here has played enough games to really have that magical feeling of, I found something, this is for me, I feel like this is so special, and we deep dive, and we become obsessive, and we really get into something.

19
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:39,883
The reason that I work in games is to help people find that feeling as often as possible.

20
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:47,103
Now that you know a little bit about me, let's talk about what I would like you to take out of this talk.

21
00:01:47,743 --> 00:01:52,165
The first is the ability to analyze your competitive audiences.

22
00:01:52,285 --> 00:02:04,891
So be able to look at a game that you say, I want to make something like that, or this kind of reminds me of my concept, and figure out, did they successfully find their audience?

23
00:02:06,074 --> 00:02:10,823
Next I'd like you to understand how to define your own audience and what that means.

24
00:02:11,504 --> 00:02:15,410
It's kind of in the title of the talk and hopefully you'll be able to speak to that at the end.

25
00:02:16,348 --> 00:02:21,392
And finally, I'd like you to leave with some actionable steps to define your audience.

26
00:02:22,193 --> 00:02:44,931
I have been to many cons and conferences, and something that always frustrated me about the talks that I went to is that a lot of them were very beginner focused, very surface level, and although it was exciting to be in those talks and feel inspired, I would immediately feel lost as soon as I left the room, and I wasn't ever really sure how to take what I had just heard

27
00:02:45,471 --> 00:02:46,813
and put it into action.

28
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:57,408
So in the content that I make I try really hard to make sure that you do have actionable steps and it feels like you have a clear path forward for how to enact what you learned today.

29
00:02:59,821 --> 00:03:04,104
We're going to start with definitions, which feels kind of silly for something called defining your audience.

30
00:03:04,164 --> 00:03:07,246
So we are defining what defining your audience means.

31
00:03:07,907 --> 00:03:10,008
And it falls on these four pillars.

32
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:13,751
Who is going to be most interested in your game?

33
00:03:13,911 --> 00:03:15,392
Who are your super fans?

34
00:03:15,852 --> 00:03:22,557
Who are the potential people who will deep dive into your lore, speed run your game, moderate your communities?

35
00:03:22,637 --> 00:03:24,479
Who are those people and where are they?

36
00:03:25,475 --> 00:03:29,160
We want to talk about the platforms that you are going to publish on.

37
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:36,951
The console wars may be over in name, but there are still differences in the audiences for each of them.

38
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,234
So where you publish matters.

39
00:03:40,216 --> 00:03:42,676
We're gonna be concerned with competition.

40
00:03:43,037 --> 00:03:43,717
Is there any?

41
00:03:44,537 --> 00:03:45,977
And is the space viable?

42
00:03:46,557 --> 00:03:48,498
As well as feature sets.

43
00:03:48,638 --> 00:03:52,518
Different types of players expect different types of things in their games.

44
00:03:53,178 --> 00:04:00,820
And if you want to be innovative, that's great, but if you completely throw people out in the left field, they may not like what they paid for.

45
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,141
Next, I wanna talk about what I call the trap.

46
00:04:06,826 --> 00:04:11,009
which I see a lot in the indie space as much as I do love the indie space.

47
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:13,111
Getting lucky is not a strategy.

48
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,253
We cannot rely on if we build it, they will come.

49
00:04:16,793 --> 00:04:21,677
There are many amazing games that nobody has seen in the world because

50
00:04:22,347 --> 00:04:28,210
we are not focused on making sure that the right people find our products.

51
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:34,654
And to put this into perspective, as you can see, 11,000 games were published on Steam just last year.

52
00:04:35,194 --> 00:04:37,135
And that's just Steam.

53
00:04:38,016 --> 00:04:39,277
What about consoles?

54
00:04:39,417 --> 00:04:41,058
What about other PC platforms?

55
00:04:41,178 --> 00:04:42,058
What about mobile?

56
00:04:42,318 --> 00:04:46,661
What about any free game anywhere on the Internet?

57
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:52,105
So we have a lot of competition and that number is only going up every single year.

58
00:04:52,705 --> 00:05:02,253
We do not have the luxury as people who want people to find us to just make something and then set it adrift without a direction.

59
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:09,379
So we need to understand that although marketing can be intimidating, that maybe it's not really our jam.

60
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,720
We want to focus on our art.

61
00:05:10,981 --> 00:05:16,265
It's all understandable, but that it's just not advisable anymore.

62
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:24,111
But some people here might be thinking, my game is amazing, though.

63
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:27,333
If I just make it, I know people will find it.

64
00:05:27,813 --> 00:05:31,295
And I want to challenge that mindset, because I'm sure your game is amazing.

65
00:05:31,795 --> 00:05:34,376
And the people who do find it might enjoy it.

66
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:37,138
But let's just talk about this slide for a second.

67
00:05:38,115 --> 00:05:39,176
Are you a game developer?

68
00:05:39,616 --> 00:05:44,680
You're here, you're in this room, which means that you have an all-access pass to GDC.

69
00:05:45,601 --> 00:05:52,386
I would hedge my bets and say that you are either a game developer already or you are aspiring to be one.

70
00:05:53,046 --> 00:05:58,270
And in either case, defining your audience helps you discover the purpose of your IP.

71
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:59,871
Is it art?

72
00:06:00,672 --> 00:06:02,153
Is it a commercial project?

73
00:06:02,489 --> 00:06:02,909
product?

74
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:05,371
Is it a personal project?

75
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:09,493
Whatever the purpose is, knowing that is important.

76
00:06:10,374 --> 00:06:12,415
So we're going to say yes, you are a game developer.

77
00:06:13,876 --> 00:06:16,277
Next, do you want players for your game?

78
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:27,804
Much like filmmakers want people to watch their movies and authors want people to read their books, we as game developers want players for our game.

79
00:06:27,944 --> 00:06:31,766
That's how they consume our art and our creativity.

80
00:06:32,651 --> 00:06:41,933
So we want to prioritize our game's features to match expectations and give a little bit of razzle dazzle sometimes.

81
00:06:42,873 --> 00:06:46,374
But most of the time we want to make sure we're meeting players where they are.

82
00:06:47,215 --> 00:06:48,575
So yes, we do want players.

83
00:06:48,955 --> 00:06:50,795
And finally, money?

84
00:06:51,596 --> 00:06:52,256
Question mark?

85
00:06:53,636 --> 00:06:55,497
This can just be any compensation.

86
00:06:55,577 --> 00:06:58,117
It doesn't have to be dollars.

87
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:01,398
It doesn't have to be currency in that way.

88
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,921
It could also be reputation.

89
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:11,491
It could be exposure, the infamous exposure that doesn't pay our bills, but maybe gets us some name recognition.

90
00:07:12,492 --> 00:07:13,954
What are your business objectives?

91
00:07:14,575 --> 00:07:18,961
If it's not money, that's fine, but you still want players.

92
00:07:19,741 --> 00:07:19,961
right?

93
00:07:20,581 --> 00:07:22,882
You're still making something, right?

94
00:07:23,742 --> 00:07:24,842
And you want people to see it.

95
00:07:25,142 --> 00:07:33,805
So we need to understand what our business objectives are in order to really make sure that the product is making its way to who it needs to.

96
00:07:35,685 --> 00:07:40,106
Now that I have kind of rambled on about that for a minute, let's do an exercise.

97
00:07:40,786 --> 00:07:42,827
We love hypotheticals here.

98
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:47,812
I want you to imagine all of the gamers in all of the world.

99
00:07:48,732 --> 00:07:54,437
We can quibble about what a gamer is, but whatever that means to you, just imagine all of them.

100
00:07:55,938 --> 00:07:59,461
Now we're gonna limit that just to the people who play RPGs.

101
00:08:00,221 --> 00:08:06,346
It's kind of a big subcategory, almost not a subcategory, but it's still there.

102
00:08:08,027 --> 00:08:10,770
Now let's talk about narrative-driven RPGs.

103
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,071
It's a little bit more narrow.

104
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:14,070
What if it's a roguelike?

105
00:08:15,431 --> 00:08:16,992
And it has stylized graphics.

106
00:08:18,393 --> 00:08:25,079
That bit right there, where the Venn diagram overlaps, is what I like to refer to as the market sweet spot.

107
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:27,181
This is where the super fans live.

108
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:36,828
This is where the speed runners, the community moderators, all of the people who wanna know you and are living inside your game live.

109
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,350
Don't say anything out loud.

110
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:44,854
This does represent a game, and I want you to think about what game this might be.

111
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:46,915
I'll give you a second.

112
00:08:49,517 --> 00:08:50,979
Surprise, it's Hades.

113
00:08:52,852 --> 00:08:55,173
Disclaimer, I have never worked on Hades.

114
00:08:55,233 --> 00:09:06,418
This is a market pull example where I want to show you that even though I've never worked on Hades, we can still talk about their success in regards to audience definition.

115
00:09:07,219 --> 00:09:08,479
So let's look at the Steam tags.

116
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:17,403
These are player-driven for the most part, and the players have identified Hades as an RPG, a roguelike with a rich story.

117
00:09:17,923 --> 00:09:19,524
It's hand-drawn and it's isometric.

118
00:09:20,287 --> 00:09:24,649
you might notice some similarities between these words and the Venn diagram that I just showed you.

119
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:44,440
The developer keywords, in other words, ways that the dev team refers to Hades in official communications, things like the storefront, press releases, trailers, use words like this, roguelike, rich atmosphere, character-driven storytelling.

120
00:09:45,141 --> 00:09:47,002
Again, you might notice some similarities.

121
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:53,292
The developer of Hades refers to Hades in the same terms that the players do.

122
00:09:54,152 --> 00:09:58,754
This is an agreement on what kind of game Hades is.

123
00:09:59,454 --> 00:10:04,776
It means that the developers of Hades were making this game and went, who is this for?

124
00:10:06,536 --> 00:10:07,817
Well, it's for these players.

125
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,096
The ones that found it.

126
00:10:10,296 --> 00:10:11,136
They did a good job.

127
00:10:11,637 --> 00:10:12,177
Good for them.

128
00:10:12,617 --> 00:10:14,198
And we know they did a good job, right?

129
00:10:14,258 --> 00:10:15,159
I heard some chuckling.

130
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:16,560
Some people guessed the right game.

131
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,281
And we know that Hades had some good news last year.

132
00:10:19,502 --> 00:10:21,383
So let's try again.

133
00:10:22,844 --> 00:10:24,465
Again, all gamers in all the world.

134
00:10:25,265 --> 00:10:26,446
But now we're going to look at shooters.

135
00:10:27,547 --> 00:10:28,907
Another big category.

136
00:10:30,408 --> 00:10:31,589
Fantasy shooters.

137
00:10:31,949 --> 00:10:33,090
Now we get a little interesting.

138
00:10:34,011 --> 00:10:35,592
What if it's magic instead of guns?

139
00:10:36,465 --> 00:10:40,551
to be able to shoot fireballs and boulders instead of guns.

140
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,375
And we get those stylized graphics again.

141
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,439
Once again, this is our market sweet spot.

142
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:47,942
Think.

143
00:10:49,063 --> 00:10:49,744
Any ideas?

144
00:10:50,846 --> 00:10:52,909
Don't say anything on what game this might be.

145
00:10:55,157 --> 00:10:55,257
it's

146
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:21,767
The developer keywords in official communications, battle royale, fantasy, battle mage, RPG, stunning graphics.

147
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:35,295
We can see once again an alignment, an agreement on what Spellbreak is between the developers and the people that the dev team was trying to reach, the people who ultimately play Spellbreak.

148
00:11:37,233 --> 00:11:41,894
Well, Cassie, that's all well and good, but how does audience definition help create success?

149
00:11:42,415 --> 00:11:44,095
There has to be an end goal.

150
00:11:44,115 --> 00:11:45,876
There has to be a positive result.

151
00:11:46,536 --> 00:11:50,777
Well, some of you might have seen, Hades made a big announcement at the end of last year.

152
00:11:50,937 --> 00:11:55,639
There's going to be a sequel, a huge achievement for any game.

153
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,560
Now it's officially a franchise.

154
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,800
That's very exciting.

155
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:04,884
and this particular screenshot was taken quite a bit ago at this point.

156
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:13,130
But you can see it's got tons of engagement and I would wager this is going to be one of the most anticipated in the early accesses of this year.

157
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,833
Very exciting and this is commercial success.

158
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:21,656
Next, we're gonna look a little more close to home.

159
00:12:22,557 --> 00:12:25,680
This is a GIF, and it's kind of a fun GIF.

160
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:33,106
Spellbreak was very focused on community and connecting with players.

161
00:12:34,027 --> 00:12:41,474
This is something that was made in-house by the team, and if you've never played Spellbreak, don't worry, I can introduce you.

162
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,701
This is Thaddeus.

163
00:12:44,421 --> 00:12:52,125
He is a general NPC who leads a charge of rebels against a fascist state.

164
00:12:53,066 --> 00:13:01,591
He is buff, he is strong, he is charismatic, and colloquially referred to by Spellbreak players as Thaddy Daddy.

165
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,722
We love him and he is Thaddy Daddy forever.

166
00:13:08,084 --> 00:13:14,989
If you were to go onto Giphy and use the keyword peaking, Thaddeus comes up.

167
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,832
And he's been on there for quite a while now.

168
00:13:18,492 --> 00:13:20,434
This GIF has over eight million views.

169
00:13:21,655 --> 00:13:29,842
And when it was first published on Giphy for months, was outperforming similar peaking GIFs, oh no.

170
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,809
Similar Peking gifts.

171
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:48,010
with the likes of George Clooney, Jim Carrey, Kim Kardashian, and to this day, if you were to go on Giphy and look up Peking, Thaddeus is there within the top 10 to 20 GIFs.

172
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,872
So it's a lot of longevity.

173
00:13:51,452 --> 00:14:04,441
It's feeding into the culture of the players and giving them something fun that they enjoy and getting a lot of notice and a lot of traction out of a simple

174
00:14:05,722 --> 00:14:06,543
but fun GIF.

175
00:14:08,946 --> 00:14:18,237
So we've done a lot of talking about hypotheticals, defining things, but I did promise you actionable steps at the beginning of this talk, so let's go through them.

176
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:19,959
Step one.

177
00:14:20,663 --> 00:14:21,985
game design document.

178
00:14:22,706 --> 00:14:26,612
These are a matter of debate within the game dev community.

179
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:27,533
I understand that.

180
00:14:28,254 --> 00:14:37,107
I fall firmly in the camp of you may not think you need it, but I would highly recommend it, especially if you are

181
00:14:37,731 --> 00:14:40,033
early on in your development career.

182
00:14:40,593 --> 00:14:52,883
These are just four categories that a game design document allows you to explore and kind of flesh out, plot, gameplay, publishing, and marketing, and your visual style.

183
00:14:53,543 --> 00:15:03,891
You may remember in our examples, these types of features come up a lot in player tags and developer keywords.

184
00:15:04,532 --> 00:15:05,913
So knowing what these are,

185
00:15:06,633 --> 00:15:11,314
is going to help you speak to and define your game for players.

186
00:15:13,074 --> 00:15:27,238
And it's just a sacred text for your whole team, filled with key information about your development process, the why for your game, where you're going with it, and what the key pillars are.

187
00:15:27,698 --> 00:15:33,559
It's something you can keep referring back to when you're five years into development and you're starting to really wonder how much you want this.

188
00:15:35,598 --> 00:15:37,400
Step two, market research.

189
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:44,327
I know this sounds kind of scary to people who aren't working in marketing and you really want to focus on building.

190
00:15:44,787 --> 00:15:45,187
I get it.

191
00:15:45,568 --> 00:15:50,473
But we're simplifying it for you today with four major questions.

192
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,635
Anybody can ask these questions.

193
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:59,441
I have total faith that everybody in this room can answer them with a little bit of work about their own games.

194
00:16:00,282 --> 00:16:03,024
Question one, is there an existing market?

195
00:16:03,484 --> 00:16:04,685
You're making a platformer.

196
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:05,946
Do platforms exist?

197
00:16:06,026 --> 00:16:06,647
Yes, they do.

198
00:16:07,848 --> 00:16:09,469
In what form do they exist?

199
00:16:10,189 --> 00:16:17,835
These are the types of things that you should ask yourself when you're thinking, how does my game and my idea fit into the market?

200
00:16:18,195 --> 00:16:26,482
If you can answer this one question in a comprehensive way, congratulations, your investor pitches just leveled up.

201
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:30,212
They're going to want to know the answer to this question.

202
00:16:30,913 --> 00:16:34,515
Grant people are going to want to know the answer to this question.

203
00:16:35,156 --> 00:16:36,737
And you need to have it for them.

204
00:16:36,897 --> 00:16:38,799
It's going to make your pitches that much better.

205
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,761
Second question, what are the common features?

206
00:16:42,441 --> 00:16:43,742
We're going to go back to the platformer.

207
00:16:43,782 --> 00:16:47,065
What kind of features do platformers have in general?

208
00:16:48,706 --> 00:16:50,828
Are you going to incorporate those, and to what extent?

209
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:57,471
Knowing what the common features are allows you to anticipate your player needs.

210
00:16:58,411 --> 00:17:05,334
And you've probably heard this phrase already so far this week, but you can't break the rules unless you know the rules.

211
00:17:05,914 --> 00:17:08,495
So figure out what the rules of your genre are.

212
00:17:09,015 --> 00:17:15,818
Even if you play a lot of games, whatever you're making, study the competition because we all have our own tastes.

213
00:17:15,878 --> 00:17:17,338
We all have our own biases.

214
00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:21,380
Try the ones that you haven't played and really figure out what's

215
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,882
comment and what players are going to expect when they boot up your game for the first time.

216
00:17:28,002 --> 00:17:29,222
Third, who stands out?

217
00:17:29,743 --> 00:17:35,685
There are probably going to be big fish in the space that have a lot of the market share for your genre.

218
00:17:36,245 --> 00:17:36,825
Who are they?

219
00:17:37,405 --> 00:17:38,225
What are they doing?

220
00:17:38,465 --> 00:17:41,066
Is it a game feature thing that makes them successful?

221
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:43,467
Is it a marketing thing that makes them successful?

222
00:17:43,927 --> 00:17:45,628
Did they just get in at the right time?

223
00:17:46,792 --> 00:17:59,199
If you can figure those things out, and for the most part I think that they're pretty clear, you're going to understand your competition, which allows you to better pitch yourself or your game against them.

224
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:10,125
And I don't mean to make that sound combative or competitive, but when we're talking about market share and the amount of time that players have to put into games, sometimes it is.

225
00:18:11,403 --> 00:18:13,084
And finally, where are the communities?

226
00:18:13,744 --> 00:18:21,767
I cannot tell you how many indie devs I have met or I have worked with who do not know where to put themselves online.

227
00:18:21,828 --> 00:18:29,511
They are overwhelmed by the number of social platforms, and they're like, I gotta be on all of them, and how am I supposed to do that?

228
00:18:29,631 --> 00:18:34,513
It's so much time to make all these assets and comment on everything and come up with copy.

229
00:18:35,475 --> 00:18:40,317
The secret, I think, is that you don't have to do that.

230
00:18:41,177 --> 00:18:51,800
If you can identify where your target audience is, where they congregate outside of games, then you know where to be.

231
00:18:52,781 --> 00:18:55,201
Do they go to Reddit and that's where they talk to each other?

232
00:18:56,042 --> 00:18:56,902
You should be on Reddit.

233
00:18:58,002 --> 00:19:00,383
Do they go to Discord and congregate there?

234
00:19:01,344 --> 00:19:02,544
You should go to Discord.

235
00:19:03,323 --> 00:19:07,487
or do they just like to be on Twitter and engage with brands that way?

236
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:09,149
Focus on that then.

237
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,852
It's not that difficult.

238
00:19:12,592 --> 00:19:20,681
It just sounds scary and it sounds intimidating, but I promise just a little bit of research is going to make this a lot easier for you.

239
00:19:22,543 --> 00:19:24,785
And step three, tone and voice.

240
00:19:25,426 --> 00:19:27,628
So you know who you want to talk to.

241
00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:42,343
You've figured out these demographics, what the average age might be, what their player type might be, if they have genre preferences, existing habits, like they binge play on the weekends or they play on the bus on the way to work.

242
00:19:43,064 --> 00:19:48,606
You know where they live, so you're looking into localization and if you might need that.

243
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:55,929
You know what kind of news outlets they'd be interested in reading from, so maybe you could reach out and do some PR.

244
00:19:56,449 --> 00:19:59,310
And you've decided what your release platforms are going to be.

245
00:20:00,649 --> 00:20:02,090
Well, why are you going to talk to them?

246
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,612
Is it just informative?

247
00:20:03,852 --> 00:20:07,295
Are you looking to build a community?

248
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:11,278
Are you going to roast them and be a Wendy's in the gaming space?

249
00:20:12,139 --> 00:20:13,900
That's a legitimate question, by the way.

250
00:20:14,461 --> 00:20:16,422
I've seen gaming companies do that.

251
00:20:17,724 --> 00:20:23,989
But if you know the answers to these questions, which hopefully with step one and step two, you've at least answered most of these questions,

252
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,032
You can figure out how to talk to them.

253
00:20:26,673 --> 00:20:36,308
Are you going to use the word yeet when you are talking to a retirement target audience and you're trying to get them to play a mobile game?

254
00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:37,750
Probably not.

255
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:44,994
and knowing how they want to be talked to is going to help you talk to them in a way that resonates.

256
00:20:45,635 --> 00:20:56,262
Because if you speak to them in a way that they don't understand and they don't get it, not only are they not going to give your game a chance, but they're probably going to report your post.

257
00:20:59,946 --> 00:21:04,272
These three steps give us access to multiple returns.

258
00:21:04,752 --> 00:21:07,055
The first of which is your active marketing.

259
00:21:07,696 --> 00:21:11,461
If you find yourself with a budget, hooray, you have a budget.

260
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:13,824
How are you going to spend it?

261
00:21:14,385 --> 00:21:16,607
Active marketing is your paid time.

262
00:21:17,588 --> 00:21:20,369
your ads, your influencers, et cetera.

263
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,150
So this is what that gives you.

264
00:21:22,951 --> 00:21:24,551
Now you know who to target with your ads.

265
00:21:25,252 --> 00:21:32,275
You can figure out which influencer communities you're interested in being exposed to your product.

266
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:38,082
Retargeting, if you have a newsletter, if you have pre-registrations, this is all going to go better.

267
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:51,033
Potentially a higher conversion rate, because you're now speaking to a community of people that you have put in the time and the work to identify as interested in what you have to offer.

268
00:21:52,194 --> 00:21:53,815
You can leverage lookalike communities.

269
00:21:53,856 --> 00:22:00,301
Hey, my game seems a lot like that game, or at least the players of that game, I think, would be really interested in my game.

270
00:22:00,868 --> 00:22:10,516
And if that's the case, maybe I can leverage my ads and my content to people who kind of represent or mimic that community.

271
00:22:12,077 --> 00:22:14,919
And you're going to reach those relevant recipients.

272
00:22:14,979 --> 00:22:22,786
So people who want to see more of your content, people who are more likely to click your ad and see what you're about.

273
00:22:24,331 --> 00:22:26,597
and you're not going to get people going, what is this?

274
00:22:27,099 --> 00:22:31,551
I don't want to see this and taking a negative action after seeing your content.

275
00:22:32,967 --> 00:22:39,731
And the last thing that we're gonna take out of all of these steps and efforts is your learnings over time.

276
00:22:40,351 --> 00:22:45,174
You have taken the time, you've put in the effort to say, why am I doing this at all?

277
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:48,677
Why am I making this, and what do I want out of it?

278
00:22:49,537 --> 00:22:59,343
This is going to inherently inform your decisions throughout development, and because you've documented it, it's gonna help you explain the decisions later on.

279
00:22:59,483 --> 00:23:02,285
When you look back, it's not gonna be buried in a Slack channel

280
00:23:02,845 --> 00:23:11,010
or in a DM or be something that you just decided off of the cuff and you're not going to have any recollection of why something was done.

281
00:23:11,971 --> 00:23:13,452
Your data-driven pivots.

282
00:23:13,872 --> 00:23:18,415
We've talked a lot about researching, gathering information.

283
00:23:18,715 --> 00:23:20,016
That's data.

284
00:23:20,676 --> 00:23:26,100
And it'll help you to make the pivots that you need to be more successful, which means

285
00:23:27,034 --> 00:23:29,916
As you can see, you can decipher the patterns.

286
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:32,917
Have you cut things from one section too much?

287
00:23:33,397 --> 00:23:35,879
Are you prioritizing something too much?

288
00:23:36,439 --> 00:23:38,100
Is your scope too large?

289
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:43,483
Scope creep is a problem and it's difficult to see sometimes unless you have that history.

290
00:23:44,921 --> 00:23:52,787
Offering top-down transparency, both to your team and to players, is something that marketing teams fight for every day.

291
00:23:52,947 --> 00:23:57,531
Just, please, legal, can I have a little more transparency?

292
00:23:58,712 --> 00:24:01,734
And having that, offering that as a developer,

293
00:24:02,214 --> 00:24:16,282
a studio founder, a director, not only gives you insight into accountability for decisions but offering credit to people who make contributions to your game.

294
00:24:16,912 --> 00:24:23,193
That leads to job satisfaction and trust and really just makes a better studio and a better team for everyone.

295
00:24:24,154 --> 00:24:35,576
With all these recorded experiences, congratulations, you are now smarter and more prepared to go on to your next project regardless of how your current project goes.

296
00:24:36,176 --> 00:24:39,877
Whether it was a resounding success or it didn't quite work out,

297
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:41,707
You've done all this.

298
00:24:42,007 --> 00:24:42,668
You know this.

299
00:24:42,988 --> 00:24:43,808
It's familiar.

300
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:50,493
And you can take it on with you to the next project and have it be quicker, easier, and more effective.

301
00:24:52,394 --> 00:24:53,195
Now we're going to zoom out.

302
00:24:54,216 --> 00:24:57,378
We started with defining your audience and what that means.

303
00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:04,963
Well, you've got three steps, your game design document, your market research, and your tone and voice, which gives you all of these great benefits.

304
00:25:05,664 --> 00:25:10,047
These aren't the only benefits, but they are the only ones I could fit inside this shape.

305
00:25:11,983 --> 00:25:22,060
All of these benefits lead to the ultimate goal, I guess, not to be redundant, of learnings and goals, hopefully meeting those goals.

306
00:25:24,349 --> 00:25:25,869
I'd like to offer you some resources.

307
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,710
These are ones that I have found personally helpful.

308
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,211
Disclaimer, these are not endorsed by Blizzard.

309
00:25:32,671 --> 00:25:36,732
These are ones that I personally, as a game dev, am offering to you.

310
00:25:37,372 --> 00:25:41,893
The Craft and Science of Game Design by Phil O'Connor is probably in the bookstore here this week.

311
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:47,614
It's a book that I own, and it's what I use to make my own game design document for my own project.

312
00:25:48,774 --> 00:25:51,536
Understandably, the books are expensive if that's not an option for you.

313
00:25:51,876 --> 00:25:54,977
GameDevBeginner.com has a great template that you could use.

314
00:25:55,858 --> 00:26:07,663
From market research, Chris Zukowski and Victoria Tran, if you are somehow unfamiliar with both of these names, I highly recommend getting familiar and signing up for the newsletters that they offer.

315
00:26:08,224 --> 00:26:13,006
You can find information from Pure Beginner to Advanced from both of them.

316
00:26:13,686 --> 00:26:20,928
and you're gonna have kind of a finger to the pulse of what's going on on the market, especially with Steam, with Chris's newsletter.

317
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:42,595
And for tone and voice, I know Udemy is kind of a hit or miss, really, when it comes to classes, but this Business Branding with Personality class by Steve Horangen is one that I took, and I found it incredibly helpful in providing language, in particular for sharing that language with my team on who are we

318
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:45,939
as a brand and who are we talking to?

319
00:26:46,499 --> 00:26:59,896
I think it really helps to simplify and visualize in a classical sense who the brand is and how you differentiate that from the team, TM.

320
00:27:00,437 --> 00:27:01,137
And it's really helpful.

321
00:27:02,762 --> 00:27:03,762
So back to the takeaways.

322
00:27:04,562 --> 00:27:13,724
I hope, now that we're here, that you feel comfortable in the process of auditing a game for successful audience definition.

323
00:27:14,604 --> 00:27:24,466
I also hope, at this point, that you understand what defining an audience means, and that you understand why it's important, not just in general, but for you.

324
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:32,388
And finally, that you can start on at least one of these three steps soon, today,

325
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:39,590
now and that you feel comfortable and you feel enabled to do that.

326
00:27:41,711 --> 00:27:41,992
Thank you.

327
00:27:47,984 --> 00:27:57,390
And, you know, if you want to talk or engage or whatever later, I'm AwesomeHylian on Twitter and most places online.

328
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:00,111
If you like reading, I am obsessed.

329
00:28:00,752 --> 00:28:03,253
You can find me on TikTok under Cassa's Bookshelf.

330
00:28:03,573 --> 00:28:09,217
And if you want to know my two cents on games, you can look up my website, IndieHorde.

331
00:28:10,377 --> 00:28:14,660
But thank you all for coming, and I hope that you've gotten some good things out of the talk.

332
00:28:16,092 --> 00:28:17,572
Seems like maybe we have some time.

333
00:28:20,173 --> 00:28:23,073
If anybody has any questions, we've got like four minutes.

334
00:28:33,415 --> 00:28:39,017
There we go.

335
00:28:39,057 --> 00:28:39,637
Great, we got it.

336
00:28:40,937 --> 00:28:43,017
Dennis over at Hitsense marketing manager.

337
00:28:43,718 --> 00:28:44,858
So we have

338
00:28:47,319 --> 00:29:04,135
a fast paced FPS roguelike coming out this year and we have the uh game dev who has a pre-established community of you know early access players and they have very much you know their own culture and their own you know uh

339
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,381
we have communicating like you've discussed.

340
00:29:07,022 --> 00:29:14,528
However, in order for us to, you know, justify a commercial success that needs to broaden, hence the audience will broaden.

341
00:29:15,068 --> 00:29:33,702
And so how would you go about bridging the gap between, say, the pre-established early access community, right, and sort of the mainstream community that needs to be sort of integrated as we continue to market and bring in more attention for the game?

342
00:29:34,352 --> 00:29:43,899
Okay, so the question is, how do you bridge the gap between an established community and reaching new audiences?

343
00:29:44,939 --> 00:29:52,144
I think that's a great question, especially if you have a really passionate base already, they wanna be the ones that you talk to.

344
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:55,707
I would say, look at a different platform.

345
00:29:56,307 --> 00:30:04,372
than what you're currently reaching that core audience on, whatever that is, look to expand in a place that they are not.

346
00:30:05,432 --> 00:30:16,479
That way it's something totally different and you can target your content in a different way so that they aren't sitting on every single post wondering, why are you saying this to me?

347
00:30:16,639 --> 00:30:17,539
I already know that.

348
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:22,082
And TikTok might actually be a good place to do that.

349
00:30:23,963 --> 00:30:24,303
This side?

350
00:30:27,093 --> 00:30:29,475
Hello, Daniel Marcus, game designer from Offworld Industries.

351
00:30:30,236 --> 00:30:34,720
Let's say, hypothetically of course, that you've already fallen into what you call the trap.

352
00:30:36,142 --> 00:30:44,610
What would one do differently in order to assess the audience that you already have and maybe continue to expand it?

353
00:30:45,202 --> 00:30:55,509
Yeah, so the question is, if we're already in the spot of if we build it, they will come, how do you move past that, even with an established community?

354
00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:02,613
I mean, the reason that this talk is titled Define Your Audience Now, Not Later, is that I think you can do that at any time.

355
00:31:03,934 --> 00:31:09,358
And whatever your current audience is, can feed into what you do in these steps.

356
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:13,961
So you can look at who is already playing the game, how they interact with the game,

357
00:31:14,434 --> 00:31:18,255
I'm sure there's some play testing and feedback loops that you've already done.

358
00:31:18,775 --> 00:31:21,896
You can look at that and extrapolate from it.

359
00:31:21,976 --> 00:31:43,402
I would say that despite the advice to not go into the trap, if you have been documenting what you've been doing with your players up until this point, you have so much data to pull from already in order to look at where your current players are operating online, what other games they play, and if they trust you, you have access

360
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:49,240
to them to ask them these questions and get that information without starting from scratch.

361
00:31:50,524 --> 00:31:50,725
Thank you.

362
00:31:51,988 --> 00:31:52,849
Hello.

363
00:31:53,389 --> 00:32:01,396
It sounds like this is a talk that's very indie focused, which means we can't make any assumptions about the size of the team or the number of hats that people are wearing.

364
00:32:02,237 --> 00:32:13,767
But just focusing on the documentation itself, I was wondering if one of the things that it seems like you had talked nearby several times but not directly at was personas.

365
00:32:14,147 --> 00:32:15,528
Client personas, user personas.

366
00:32:15,989 --> 00:32:22,194
And I was wondering where, within the framework that you usually work with, would you see personas?

367
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:27,218
What complementary tools nearby help you get the best value out of that?

368
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:31,342
Where does that fit into your overall documentation and product strategy?

369
00:32:31,946 --> 00:32:47,514
Okay, so the question, and correct me if I'm wrong, is when it comes to dealing with personas and documentation, where do the personas fit in with this and what kinds of tools might we use to incorporate personas into the documentation?

370
00:32:47,734 --> 00:32:54,558
Yes, what are the other things that you've seen, other tools that help you get the most value out of those tools, out of personas?

371
00:32:55,774 --> 00:32:59,357
So the personas are in themselves a type of tool.

372
00:33:00,438 --> 00:33:04,321
It's kind of like a marketing personality test, almost.

373
00:33:05,101 --> 00:33:14,208
And I think when it comes to incorporating those into your documentation, it's not so much an add-on, it's a foundational piece.

374
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:23,976
So you're going to want to look for something to manipulate the personas within your documentation, rather than use the personas to manipulate

375
00:33:24,818 --> 00:33:26,841
whatever else you have in there.

376
00:33:27,401 --> 00:33:36,433
If you're saying that you're talking to a hero or an explorer, that is a foundational aspect of the audience you're trying to reach.

377
00:33:37,034 --> 00:33:57,882
So when I am, for instance, setting up, like, who are we talking to, here's a tone and voice pitch, I'm going to extrapolate on, say, the explorer archetype and say, these are the types of things that they like, these are the types of activities that they're interested in, and their motivation for playing a game.

378
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:01,564
How can we tie that into our feature set, and is that represented?

379
00:34:02,239 --> 00:34:17,704
in our feature set, and you can leverage that to pitch to product or to anybody on dev side and say, look, this is who we really think is going to be plugged in, and we need to speak to why they are plugged in.

380
00:34:18,205 --> 00:34:26,968
So it's really a leveraging tool to help you make the argument for a marketing-driven change to the game.

381
00:34:28,462 --> 00:34:34,085
I've seen personas talked about in context of a value proposition outside of games.

382
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:42,669
And I assume that when, in the context of the design document you were talking about, maybe they could tie directly to your pillars, your design pillars that you're establishing?

383
00:34:42,689 --> 00:34:42,950
Yes.

384
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:43,590
Okay.

385
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:47,532
So yeah, I was just curious if that, if there's a direct link, what that might, yeah.

386
00:34:47,872 --> 00:34:50,854
I mean, the direct link is it, you know, it's however direct you want it to be.

387
00:34:51,014 --> 00:34:55,056
It's really just a matter of how, how close you want those things to be.

388
00:34:55,749 --> 00:35:02,636
or if you want it to be kind of a side nice to have sort of thing.

389
00:35:02,936 --> 00:35:03,437
Thank you very much.

390
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:05,719
Do we have any more?

391
00:35:05,879 --> 00:35:06,820
Is there time for one more?

392
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:11,778
Yes, one more.

393
00:35:11,898 --> 00:35:12,278
Okay.

394
00:35:12,438 --> 00:35:13,759
Hi, I'm Justine.

395
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:18,439
I'm a product manager and I work for a small indie studio in LA.

396
00:35:18,879 --> 00:35:21,760
I was happy to see Victoria Tran on your slide because I'm a huge fan.

397
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,900
I was in her talk earlier.

398
00:35:24,721 --> 00:35:32,322
Just using her content and her lessons have actually grown our TikTok to over 180k followers in four months.

399
00:35:32,362 --> 00:35:33,162
I'm really proud of that.

400
00:35:33,662 --> 00:35:38,283
But I was wondering if you had any thoughts on the potential TikTok ban and

401
00:35:38,723 --> 00:35:43,105
You said to focus, you don't have to focus on everything, you can just focus on one platform.

402
00:35:43,586 --> 00:35:48,648
But now there's all this worry and there's a lot of messaging out there saying we need to diversify.

403
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,150
What are your feelings on like

404
00:35:52,043 --> 00:35:58,185
full steam ahead on just Tick Tock or you know maybe shifting a little to YouTube based on current events.

405
00:35:58,305 --> 00:36:12,531
Yeah so the question is we have an established community on one platform how do we feel about diversification from when you're being told to diversify versus just really doubling down on one platform.

406
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:15,912
It sounds like you've had a lot of success on Tick Tock that's very exciting.

407
00:36:16,933 --> 00:36:20,314
Before you you know diversify quote unquote

408
00:36:21,094 --> 00:36:44,889
You should consider who you're trying to reach because wherever you do diversify Needs to match who you want to reach and if the people that you are Saying this is our core audience if their primary social platform is tick-tock Like at a certain point in development, of course, you want to be everywhere But when you're building that initial community and you want to say this is our hub.

409
00:36:44,949 --> 00:36:45,890
This is where we are and

410
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:51,773
I would hesitate to recommend that that be everywhere.

411
00:36:53,194 --> 00:36:56,555
So I would say look at the other platforms.

412
00:36:56,615 --> 00:37:05,160
Maybe the closest in demographic would be Instagram to TikTok, especially if people are really enjoying your visual video footage.

413
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:13,204
And you can more easily repurpose TikTok content for something like Reels or even YouTube Shorts if you want to go that way.

414
00:37:13,785 --> 00:37:15,966
But don't just blindly

415
00:37:16,781 --> 00:37:22,983
start investing in another platform without confirming that the audience you want to reach is there.

416
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:39,849
I know it's scary and there's a lot of information coming from different directions, but to go back to the idea of you're everywhere and so you're nowhere, make sure that you're gonna still reach people that you wanna reach before you do that.

417
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:41,030
Thank you so much.

418
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:43,611
Yeah, okay, we are out of time, everybody.

419
00:37:43,691 --> 00:37:44,251
Thank you again.
