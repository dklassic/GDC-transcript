00:00:23,687 --> 00:00:28,732
Hello everyone, I'm very happy to be featured for this online GDC.

2
00:00:28,732 --> 00:00:33,856
I'm Oranier Peters, I've been working at Azobu Studio for 10 years,

3
00:00:33,856 --> 00:00:36,999
and I was Audio Director on the Plague Tale.

4
00:00:36,999 --> 00:00:41,343
So we are going to talk about the audio production of the Plague Tale Innocence.

5
00:00:41,343 --> 00:00:47,128
We'll cover different areas of the game soundscape, the RAS audio, and the tech we used to design it.

6
00:00:47,528 --> 00:00:51,860
The stealth mechanics more widely, how audio can extend narration,

7
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,332
how we try not only to stick a sound on the picture, but to amplify and echo the story.

8
00:00:58,115 --> 00:01:00,837
First, let's talk a bit about the game.

9
00:01:00,837 --> 00:01:04,358
A Plague Tale, in a sense, is a story about two siblings' relationship,

10
00:01:04,358 --> 00:01:07,260
Hugo and Amicia, and the evolution of this relationship.

11
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,082
It's a story about two children confronting middle-aged brutality

12
00:01:12,082 --> 00:01:14,904
with inquisition hunts and plague on background.

13
00:01:14,904 --> 00:01:17,565
So you get the big picture of the game and that's quite dark.

14
00:01:18,604 --> 00:01:22,985
That's from this setup and story that we choose to deliver a third-person stealth gameplay.

15
00:01:22,985 --> 00:01:28,288
The children are not powerful and they need to cover to survive in this hostile environment.

16
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:32,510
There's also some puzzle elements, a very strong narrative background,

17
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:39,032
and on top of that we created a technology that made us able to handle 5,000 rats on screen.

18
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:43,454
Rat swarms. They are also a major part of gameplay and story.

19
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:46,507
That's it for a quick presentation of the game.

20
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:50,832
If you want to learn more about the story, don't hesitate to play the game.

21
00:01:50,832 --> 00:01:54,075
On the production side, it was a new IP for Asobo Studio,

22
00:01:54,075 --> 00:01:56,457
with a dev team of 45 people.

23
00:01:56,457 --> 00:01:58,979
We were 3 people for audio, with one sound designer,

24
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:02,883
one audio director and one composer, Olivier DeriviÃ¨re.

25
00:02:02,883 --> 00:02:06,266
Creating a new IP is tricky, but it's also very fascinating.

26
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,739
For Up Like Tail, we had a local background.

27
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:12,881
The action takes place in the southwest of France, where we live.

28
00:02:12,881 --> 00:02:14,882
So we really had this project at heart,

29
00:02:14,882 --> 00:02:18,443
and we did our maximum to deliver something personal and authentic.

30
00:02:18,443 --> 00:02:20,704
The game took two years to be made,

31
00:02:20,704 --> 00:02:23,826
and quite frankly, we are very proud of it.

32
00:02:23,826 --> 00:02:29,268
So I'll now move on with more audio-oriented subjects.

33
00:02:29,268 --> 00:02:31,429
As I said, it was a brand new IP,

34
00:02:31,429 --> 00:02:34,150
so we had to build identity in every aspect of the game.

35
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:39,036
For the audio direction, and more globally for the whole artistic vision of the project,

36
00:02:39,036 --> 00:02:43,237
I always remember something our creative director said that describes well the vision,

37
00:02:43,237 --> 00:02:44,878
and that guided us.

38
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:47,378
Its crude middle age, a rough and rusty era.

39
00:02:47,378 --> 00:02:49,799
The story we tell is very dark.

40
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:54,020
It was kind of our leitmotif, and it influenced many choices for audio.

41
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,280
We were willing to create something grinding.

42
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,841
We wanted the player to hear and feel this rusty and brutal atmosphere.

43
00:03:00,706 --> 00:03:07,749
It took some time to find the right tonal balance, to make the sound design authentic without making it too thin.

44
00:03:07,749 --> 00:03:10,510
So we looked for inspiration and influences to help.

45
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:15,492
For example, for Foley, we found an interesting influence with Game of Thrones.

46
00:03:15,492 --> 00:03:19,954
We really liked the way they handled their Foley, brutal but realistic.

47
00:03:20,797 --> 00:03:26,260
As for ambience, with the beautiful and very detailed environment the artists were creating,

48
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,982
we knew we had to deliver something very detailed too.

49
00:03:28,982 --> 00:03:31,603
We worked a lot on creating those ambiences.

50
00:03:31,603 --> 00:03:37,086
With a lot of randomized emitters, with wind, birds, leaf, or whatever the environment needed,

51
00:03:37,086 --> 00:03:39,328
we wanted the audio to add something to the picture.

52
00:03:40,692 --> 00:03:46,059
On the VO side, for a more authentic feeling, we decided to have children do the voiceover.

53
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:51,827
During the prototype phase, we did some recording tests with our kids, and it was really bringing

54
00:03:51,827 --> 00:03:52,988
something.

55
00:03:52,988 --> 00:03:57,975
So even if it was costing a lot more time, we felt that it would bring something to the

56
00:03:57,975 --> 00:03:58,496
experience.

57
00:03:59,052 --> 00:04:06,156
Talking about middle age, the other question was, how do we handle it? Are we going the full medieval

58
00:04:06,156 --> 00:04:11,298
folkloric way with old english dialogues and medieval instruments for the music?

59
00:04:11,298 --> 00:04:17,301
Again we found inspiration with how some movies handled past era, such as Macbeth,

60
00:04:17,301 --> 00:04:24,264
released in 2015, or The Witch. They provided an artistic vision to their era without making

61
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,805
folkloric or ridicules.

62
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:31,853
We wanted to go the same way, something contemporary with subtle medieval colors,

63
00:04:31,853 --> 00:04:35,458
dialogues with a light touch of medieval, and for the music,

64
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:39,143
it was the same, some colors to remind of the era but not folkloric.

65
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:43,132
We had many other influences and it's hard to cite them all,

66
00:04:43,132 --> 00:04:45,193
some for the artistic audio direction,

67
00:04:45,193 --> 00:04:46,934
others for the technical audio direction,

68
00:04:46,934 --> 00:04:49,836
and they really helped us build the soundtrack.

69
00:04:49,836 --> 00:04:52,517
So thanks to all these games and movies for that.

70
00:04:52,517 --> 00:04:56,279
Another subject I'd like to mention is the workflow with the composer.

71
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:59,942
As on every game, at one point, the following question arises.

72
00:04:59,942 --> 00:05:02,923
Who will be the composer and how do we work with him?

73
00:05:03,501 --> 00:05:07,643
I guess every studio and production are different, and that's the same with composers.

74
00:05:07,643 --> 00:05:11,745
I worked with several composers, and it was different every time.

75
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:16,908
So there's no production magic trick, no easy answers, but here's some hints to find a workflow

76
00:05:16,908 --> 00:05:20,550
with a composer, and what was your personal experience with the play table.

77
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:25,072
So we started by pitching the project to different composers.

78
00:05:25,581 --> 00:05:31,063
We had some ideas about what we wanted and when we pitched it to Olivier Deriviere,

79
00:05:31,063 --> 00:05:32,204
we didn't talk about the music.

80
00:05:32,204 --> 00:05:35,225
First, he wanted to deeply understand the vision of the game

81
00:05:35,225 --> 00:05:38,766
and what the creative director wanted to achieve.

82
00:05:38,766 --> 00:05:40,867
He was really digging inside the project core.

83
00:05:40,867 --> 00:05:43,728
We felt it was really appropriate to our game.

84
00:05:43,728 --> 00:05:49,351
We needed someone that really understands the narrative and how the story was told,

85
00:05:49,351 --> 00:05:53,032
to be able to add a narrative layer thanks to the music score.

86
00:05:53,032 --> 00:05:54,833
It was not about throwing music on a picture.

87
00:05:56,249 --> 00:06:01,253
So on top of that, and that can sound a bit obvious, but you need someone that plays the

88
00:06:01,253 --> 00:06:07,578
game regularly, that's the only way to understand the interactive needs. Videos are great, but that's

89
00:06:07,578 --> 00:06:12,822
not what we are doing. So when you hire a video game music composer, you expect someone that

90
00:06:12,822 --> 00:06:15,704
understands the interactive media and constraints.

91
00:06:15,898 --> 00:06:18,560
And to be honest, it's a relief for the audio team.

92
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,905
You know the composer will be able to provide music systems that will be applicable to your game

93
00:06:23,905 --> 00:06:27,468
and how to make them work in an interactive music engine.

94
00:06:27,468 --> 00:06:32,172
So yeah, it's really nice to have someone that understands Wwise or FMOD, for example.

95
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:42,821
Especially on small productions, I would say it's really important to hire someone that speaks both languages, music and video games.

96
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:51,568
So if you want to work with someone coming from line art media, you need to be prepared to handle audio engine integration and editing.

97
00:06:51,568 --> 00:06:53,669
You will need someone to do it.

98
00:06:53,669 --> 00:07:00,274
So I guess it's better if we have the person creating the music score, handling the integration and editing.

99
00:07:01,268 --> 00:07:06,891
After this audio direction and workflow talk, I'll now elaborate a bit on the technology used.

100
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:12,653
They were quite simple and relied on Wwise, so I won't spend much time on this since it's pretty

101
00:07:12,653 --> 00:07:18,015
much standard features that you can find in any audio engines. I'll spend more time on custom

102
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:25,338
tools and specific stuff. So we use a custom in-house engine and Wwise is integrated in it.

103
00:07:25,338 --> 00:07:30,520
We implement also ambient and animation audio in our editor for in-game.

104
00:07:32,663 --> 00:07:35,807
where all the logic and dialogues are implemented.

105
00:07:35,807 --> 00:07:40,714
If you want to, let's say, trigger music just after a VO line,

106
00:07:40,714 --> 00:07:41,815
this is where we put it.

107
00:07:41,815 --> 00:07:45,280
So we have environmental reverb for acoustics

108
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,344
and a Raycast array-based occlusion.

109
00:07:48,344 --> 00:07:51,568
It's pretty simple, but it provided enough realism for our game.

110
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:57,131
I would say one of our most important tools was our VO manager tool.

111
00:07:57,131 --> 00:08:02,116
It handled all the VO lines, WAV files and exported them directly into Wwise.

112
00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:07,281
Thanks to it, we had a quick workflow and everyone was able to access and listen to all the VO files.

113
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:11,766
Narrative designers were able to write lines, they were directly

114
00:08:11,766 --> 00:08:14,249
exported into Wwise in text-to-speech format.

115
00:08:15,105 --> 00:08:19,547
it was important that the team wasn't relying on audio people for VO implementation.

116
00:08:19,547 --> 00:08:25,870
As a narrative game, VO was essential and level designers needed to iterate a lot.

117
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:30,933
As for handling all the WAV files, we got the WAV files directly from the recording studio

118
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:38,176
and the VO import process was done by producers. The tool did some sanity checking on file names

119
00:08:38,176 --> 00:08:41,418
and so we were sure that the VO delivered were correctly named.

120
00:08:41,758 --> 00:08:47,882
So that was great because audio people, we were focused on the mix and audio related stuff

121
00:08:47,882 --> 00:08:54,407
and not on managing WAV files. On narrative games, you can get lost managing files and stuff

122
00:08:54,407 --> 00:08:59,111
and this tool was a lifesaver for us because we had like 7,000 video per language.

123
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:05,477
For audio, we did some scripting with command line tools SOCKS and BS1770 to detect huge

124
00:09:05,477 --> 00:09:08,801
dynamic range or clipping video.

125
00:09:08,801 --> 00:09:14,487
These free and open source tools are very helpful for small production like us because

126
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:17,630
you can script with them and easily generate reports.

127
00:09:23,984 --> 00:09:28,347
To end up the tool section, I will show you a feature we developed for Foley,

128
00:09:28,347 --> 00:09:31,229
a system based on characters' bone acceleration.

129
00:09:31,229 --> 00:09:34,732
Following the acceleration of specific bones, it drives an RTPC,

130
00:09:34,732 --> 00:09:38,635
allowing us to have subtone Foley for every movement of the character.

131
00:09:38,635 --> 00:09:44,059
This was really convenient, and most of the times it was enough for our Foley need.

132
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:46,902
Or when needed, we added audio events on top of it.

133
00:09:46,902 --> 00:09:48,303
So here's a quick video demo.

134
00:10:29,425 --> 00:10:32,606
So we had really simple but flexible tools.

135
00:10:32,606 --> 00:10:35,527
Now let's talk about the main feature of the game, rats.

136
00:10:35,527 --> 00:10:39,588
In game, rats are handled like a fluid system.

137
00:10:39,588 --> 00:10:42,729
We are talking about 5,000 rats, afraid by light

138
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:45,710
and ready to eat whatever they find on their way.

139
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,910
Roughly, they will behave like water,

140
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,111
approaching and fainting like waves.

141
00:10:50,111 --> 00:10:52,271
So we had to work with Olivier Deriviere

142
00:10:52,271 --> 00:10:54,752
to create an audio system that will be balanced

143
00:10:54,752 --> 00:10:56,333
between music and SFX.

144
00:10:57,245 --> 00:10:59,928
We couldn't put music each time RADSphere featured on screen,

145
00:10:59,928 --> 00:11:02,911
it would have been annoying and we'd have loose contrast.

146
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:07,596
With only SFX, it would have been a bit boring and not contrast enough.

147
00:11:07,596 --> 00:11:11,420
So we looked for a grammar that allowed us to complete each other.

148
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:16,145
We had to find when to put music and when SFX had to be alone in the soundscape,

149
00:11:16,145 --> 00:11:18,188
or how to make them fit both in the mix.

150
00:11:19,085 --> 00:11:22,889
RATS SFX, they were here to feed back common states of the swarms.

151
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:26,273
It was an audio state machine reflecting rats' behavior.

152
00:11:26,273 --> 00:11:29,517
As for the rats' audio, we used a lot of disgusting contents.

153
00:11:29,517 --> 00:11:33,202
Squish, pig screams, horses hitting.

154
00:11:33,202 --> 00:11:37,527
As I said before, we wanted the rats to be organic, so we used organic recording.

155
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:43,080
We were not able to go too crazy on the effects side, so rats were a blend of all this stuff.

156
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:48,221
On the other side, music was here to tell a story and showcase the rats,

157
00:11:48,221 --> 00:11:53,682
during cinematics or rats' brutal appearance. For the rats' music, Olivier used cello and,

158
00:11:53,682 --> 00:11:58,703
thanks to the virtuosic playing of Eric Maria Couturier, we had some crazy textures

159
00:11:58,703 --> 00:12:03,404
and fast cello lines perfectly evocating the aura of the rats. Let's have a listen.

160
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:23,815
So this grammar was really helpful to deliver a nice mix and as you all know the audio spectrum

161
00:12:23,815 --> 00:12:29,099
is limited and it can be tricky to explain for non-audio people in the team. You can have

162
00:12:29,099 --> 00:12:34,142
everything upfront in the mix. You need to take decisions and you can have an explosion,

163
00:12:34,142 --> 00:12:39,886
a crucial dialogue with the dramatic music on top of that. So here's a RAT video sequence where you

164
00:12:39,886 --> 00:12:45,390
be able to hear the relation between music, SFX and narration and how we balanced all these

165
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,711
elements in the audio spectrum.

166
00:12:47,206 --> 00:13:07,080
I'll subtitle videos so I won't be bothering you with my voice.

167
00:13:22,892 --> 00:13:33,637
It's a nightmare! We have to get back outside Amicia! I know, keep moving!

168
00:13:33,637 --> 00:13:37,919
Now another quick video to hear how we showcase the rats thanks to Music Stingers. The cello is

169
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:44,342
once again featured heavily. When the player was hearing this cello, he knew directly there would

170
00:13:44,342 --> 00:13:44,922
be rats around.

171
00:13:48,473 --> 00:13:50,053
In the light! In the light! Quick!

172
00:13:50,053 --> 00:13:52,534
I don't see a torch.

173
00:13:52,534 --> 00:14:07,717
How? How are we going to do this?

174
00:14:07,717 --> 00:14:10,617
It seems to be taking care of them.

175
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:11,877
Are you sure?

176
00:14:11,877 --> 00:14:13,638
Another jambon should be fine.

177
00:14:34,849 --> 00:14:41,066
To end up this RATS talk, I'll show you one last video where you can see the implementation of the RATS state machine.

178
00:15:35,362 --> 00:15:39,664
I'll now elaborate on another important feature of the game, stealth gameplay.

179
00:15:39,664 --> 00:15:44,746
The goal was once again to reunite all the soundtrack's elements and make them breathe

180
00:15:44,746 --> 00:15:46,847
together in an interactive way.

181
00:15:46,847 --> 00:15:51,750
Stealth sections were critical gameplay sections, and the player needed to perfectly understand

182
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,451
the situation he was in.

183
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:57,593
In Up Like Tail, when you get caught by a guard, you have a big chance of ending up

184
00:15:57,593 --> 00:15:57,913
dying.

185
00:15:58,574 --> 00:16:03,936
So audio feedbacks were clearly important, and on top of that, for immersive reasons,

186
00:16:03,936 --> 00:16:09,018
we didn't want to avoid too much UI, so audio feedback was crucial for this.

187
00:16:09,018 --> 00:16:14,140
I now illustrate how to make the soundscape evolve around common variables.

188
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,901
Video, SFX, and music are tied to these variables,

189
00:16:16,901 --> 00:16:20,363
and they are evolving together following gameplay evolution.

190
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:27,645
In this example, two variables are used, the level of detection by guard and closest guard distance.

191
00:16:27,645 --> 00:16:30,567
For VO, it's connected to Amicia's breathing.

192
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:34,610
When guards are getting close, she starts breathing faster, for example.

193
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:40,154
For music, music layers are evolving following the closest guard and the level of detection.

194
00:16:40,154 --> 00:16:43,856
The closest you get to a guard, the more bars you'll have, for example.

195
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:47,861
SFX were played on top of that for detection state change,

196
00:16:47,861 --> 00:16:52,143
with the lower bit played each time she's detected.

197
00:16:52,143 --> 00:16:54,084
It was really to underline state change.

198
00:16:54,084 --> 00:16:58,846
The idea was to make it very immersive and connected to Amicia.

199
00:16:58,846 --> 00:17:01,227
We didn't want the sounds to be UI-ish,

200
00:17:01,227 --> 00:17:05,370
we wanted them to come from Amicia emotional state.

201
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:08,791
This allowed us to extend what was on screen

202
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:12,613
and we were a reflection of Amicia emotional state.

203
00:17:12,613 --> 00:17:14,214
Let's have a look at the example.

204
00:17:40,015 --> 00:18:01,936
Enough! I'm going to get you out of your hole!

205
00:18:01,936 --> 00:18:04,398
So you're gone. Why, I wonder?

206
00:18:13,304 --> 00:18:16,900
You again? Hey, you! Don't move, or I'll...

207
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:43,655
This was a short footage of stealth mechanics.

208
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:47,345
It's interesting because most of these nuances

209
00:18:47,345 --> 00:18:49,130
won't be clearly noticed by players.

210
00:18:49,812 --> 00:18:53,454
If your game is played in playtest, they won't say,

211
00:18:53,454 --> 00:18:57,316
I like the fact that the low cello entered when I was getting close to the quad,

212
00:18:57,316 --> 00:18:59,958
but they will feel it strongly.

213
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:04,401
And that's when you start adding layers of emotions on top of the game, thanks to audio.

214
00:19:04,401 --> 00:19:08,423
And we study on the engines such as Wwise or Fmod or Unity,

215
00:19:08,423 --> 00:19:11,365
we really have powerful tools for audio.

216
00:19:11,365 --> 00:19:13,966
It's really possible to work on the whole audioscape.

217
00:19:13,966 --> 00:19:17,168
And that's what interactivity really is.

218
00:19:17,348 --> 00:19:20,569
making the soundscape evolve following player selection.

219
00:19:20,569 --> 00:19:23,810
Let's get back to music and music grammar.

220
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:28,371
Creating a musical grammar is essential, but what is also interesting

221
00:19:28,371 --> 00:19:31,712
is to use this grammar in different situations and contexts.

222
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:35,393
It can help connecting gameplay and story for example,

223
00:19:35,393 --> 00:19:37,873
and that's the key for giving depth to a soundtrack.

224
00:19:37,873 --> 00:19:43,114
Let's have a look at what last game sequence and how One Music Stingers is

225
00:19:43,114 --> 00:19:44,115
able to resonate.

226
00:19:44,195 --> 00:19:49,938
all along a game section, and how a music stinger is able to serve gameplay and narration at the same time.

227
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:54,141
Look! We found it! The castle!

228
00:19:54,141 --> 00:19:59,024
Wow, it really exists! ChÃ¢teau d'Ambranche!

229
00:19:59,024 --> 00:20:02,726
It's amazing! I had a moment of doubt, but that...

230
00:20:02,726 --> 00:20:08,469
That's the Sword of Arken, it's a legend I like!

231
00:20:08,469 --> 00:20:09,970
Come on, let's take a closer look!

232
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:24,553
I don't see you. I don't see how

233
00:20:24,553 --> 00:20:27,195
Never again

234
00:20:27,195 --> 00:20:30,818
Building

235
00:20:30,818 --> 00:20:40,524
We're very high up don't worry Hugo

236
00:20:46,263 --> 00:20:49,585
I tried to cover the main aspects of Up Like Tail audio direction.

237
00:20:49,585 --> 00:20:54,528
It might feel like a glimpse actually, but I gave you the key elements of our soundtrack.

238
00:20:54,528 --> 00:20:59,791
With Up Like Tail, we did our best to not only provide audio over GAM sequences,

239
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:06,055
we wanted to really provide a new layer of emotion on top of the game that won't be only squeaks.

240
00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:07,716
I hope you learned one thing or two,

241
00:21:07,716 --> 00:21:10,558
and if you have any questions, you can contact me on Twitter.

242
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:11,258
See you!
