1
00:00:06,093 --> 00:00:12,646
We are going to get going if you all promise to silence all of your noise-making devices.

2
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:15,611
I know you're going to do it. You're going to be really good. Okay.

3
00:00:17,703 --> 00:00:19,624
My name is Kristen Cox.

4
00:00:19,624 --> 00:00:21,886
I'm a game director at ArenaNet.

5
00:00:21,886 --> 00:00:26,809
I've been making games for a little over 14 years,

6
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:29,231
and for about the last 10 years,

7
00:00:29,231 --> 00:00:32,513
I've been primarily focused on microtransaction design

8
00:00:32,513 --> 00:00:34,715
and microtransaction strategy,

9
00:00:34,715 --> 00:00:36,937
or leading teams that are responsible

10
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:40,019
for microtransaction design or microtransaction strategy.

11
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:41,300
Most recently for Guild Wars 2.

12
00:00:43,249 --> 00:00:46,812
But my career has mostly been large scale MMOs.

13
00:00:46,812 --> 00:00:48,774
So a lot of the examples I'm gonna give here

14
00:00:48,774 --> 00:00:50,276
are gonna be from large scale MMOs,

15
00:00:50,276 --> 00:00:51,997
but a lot of the stuff I'm talking about

16
00:00:51,997 --> 00:00:54,820
should be fairly universal, hopefully.

17
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,084
So, today we're gonna talk about microtransaction design.

18
00:00:59,084 --> 00:01:00,666
I'm actually gonna do you one better.

19
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,567
We're gonna talk about good microtransaction design.

20
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:04,409
You're all gonna get your money's worth,

21
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:05,390
which is gonna be nice.

22
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:05,430
So,

23
00:01:07,555 --> 00:01:10,416
It's important to ask what do I mean by good,

24
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:11,737
because that could mean a lot of things,

25
00:01:11,737 --> 00:01:13,318
especially when we talk about design.

26
00:01:13,318 --> 00:01:16,320
In this case, I'm talking about designs for systems

27
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,482
and items that please players,

28
00:01:19,482 --> 00:01:22,663
that inspire players to engage with them repeatedly,

29
00:01:22,663 --> 00:01:25,285
and that increase the quality of your game as a whole.

30
00:01:26,309 --> 00:01:27,470
So that's what we mean by good design,

31
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,831
and in fact, that's a pretty broad definition

32
00:01:29,831 --> 00:01:31,112
for good design that could be applied

33
00:01:31,112 --> 00:01:32,672
to basically any type of design,

34
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:35,834
and that's because microtransaction design is game design.

35
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:37,895
It's a specialized part of it,

36
00:01:37,895 --> 00:01:41,317
but it's not really all that segregated.

37
00:01:41,317 --> 00:01:43,798
But it is a specialized part of game design,

38
00:01:43,798 --> 00:01:46,139
and it comes with a couple of special considerations.

39
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:49,561
Some are really simple perception shifts,

40
00:01:49,561 --> 00:01:52,022
and some are really highly unintuitive.

41
00:01:52,502 --> 00:01:55,264
So the bulk of this talk is gonna be me walking through

42
00:01:55,264 --> 00:01:58,246
some of those considerations, those special considerations

43
00:01:58,246 --> 00:02:00,187
that I feel are the most important

44
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:02,148
when it comes to doing good microtransaction design.

45
00:02:02,148 --> 00:02:07,132
And it's gonna be organized around these big ideas loosely.

46
00:02:07,132 --> 00:02:10,494
So let's dive right in because there's a lot of stuff.

47
00:02:10,494 --> 00:02:11,314
There's like 95 slides.

48
00:02:11,314 --> 00:02:15,297
Okay, understanding value, the most fundamental.

49
00:02:15,297 --> 00:02:17,318
So one of the most basic questions

50
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:20,300
that we ask in design is why.

51
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,801
Why does this system exist?

52
00:02:22,578 --> 00:02:26,379
Why does this player want to go into this cave?

53
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:29,479
All the way up to why are we even making this game?

54
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:34,000
Good design comes from having good answers for why.

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,961
Answers that focus on players' needs and what they want,

56
00:02:37,961 --> 00:02:41,062
rather than the designers' needs.

57
00:02:41,062 --> 00:02:42,903
When design decisions are motivated

58
00:02:42,903 --> 00:02:45,043
by solving developer problems,

59
00:02:45,043 --> 00:02:46,803
like we need this game to be longer

60
00:02:46,803 --> 00:02:48,824
so we don't get dinged in the reviews,

61
00:02:48,824 --> 00:02:50,544
we inevitably end up with weak design

62
00:02:50,544 --> 00:02:51,785
and weak player engagement.

63
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:55,400
This is why when we ask the question,

64
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,201
why are we making this microtransaction,

65
00:02:57,201 --> 00:03:02,363
it's really, really important that the answer never be

66
00:03:02,363 --> 00:03:03,124
because we need to make money.

67
00:03:03,124 --> 00:03:06,745
Okay, but yes, you're saying, we do need to make money.

68
00:03:06,745 --> 00:03:08,727
Actually, that's important to us.

69
00:03:08,727 --> 00:03:10,127
Of course it is.

70
00:03:10,127 --> 00:03:12,188
Game developers have lots of needs.

71
00:03:12,188 --> 00:03:14,429
Money is actually usually kind of

72
00:03:14,429 --> 00:03:16,851
a fundamental baseline need for you or your company.

73
00:03:17,445 --> 00:03:20,346
or anyone else that's trying to sell something,

74
00:03:20,346 --> 00:03:21,687
that makes sense.

75
00:03:21,687 --> 00:03:23,188
But we're talking about design,

76
00:03:23,188 --> 00:03:25,189
and we're talking about you acting as a designer

77
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:25,709
in this scenario.

78
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:28,370
And so if you want to do great design,

79
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,691
you're going to have to set aside your needs,

80
00:03:30,691 --> 00:03:33,112
and you're going to have to set aside your company's needs,

81
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:34,993
and you're going to have to focus on your players' needs.

82
00:03:36,794 --> 00:03:44,020
I'm not saying this as some kind of anti-capitalism, let's make art, not money, that's not what

83
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,721
this is about.

84
00:03:44,721 --> 00:03:50,046
Your microtransaction items are going to be more successful if you focus on player benefit

85
00:03:50,046 --> 00:03:54,850
more than your need for cash because the first rule of selling anything, the first rule of

86
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,532
commerce is that people only buy things that have value to them.

87
00:03:57,532 --> 00:03:58,233
Basically we went one too far.

88
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:05,504
Players don't care about your needs.

89
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:09,425
I just went right by it, because you all know that, right?

90
00:04:09,425 --> 00:04:11,886
Players are applying a pretty brutal value assessment

91
00:04:11,886 --> 00:04:13,507
to everything that you release,

92
00:04:13,507 --> 00:04:15,988
and your need for cash, your cash flow,

93
00:04:15,988 --> 00:04:17,308
how much revenue you're making.

94
00:04:17,308 --> 00:04:18,769
It just doesn't factor into that assessment.

95
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:20,290
They really just don't care.

96
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,851
A great example of this at a high level

97
00:04:22,851 --> 00:04:24,331
is the decline and failure

98
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,412
of the monthly game subscription business model.

99
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:27,909
There we go.

100
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:30,910
So why do monthly game subscriptions exist?

101
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,850
Well, if they do exist anymore, they sort of don't.

102
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,992
I thought about this a little bit, came up with a list.

103
00:04:36,992 --> 00:04:39,753
This is not like a completely exhaustive list,

104
00:04:39,753 --> 00:04:43,334
but I think it's a pretty good list of the top reasons

105
00:04:43,334 --> 00:04:46,175
that monthly subscription fees existed.

106
00:04:47,425 --> 00:04:50,848
So that list obviously has pretty high developer value

107
00:04:50,848 --> 00:04:52,870
and pretty low customer value.

108
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,833
It's really strongly skewed

109
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,115
towards the developer slash publisher.

110
00:04:58,115 --> 00:05:00,457
As audiences for online games got bigger

111
00:05:00,457 --> 00:05:01,678
and they got more sophisticated,

112
00:05:01,678 --> 00:05:05,602
their ability to see funding continued development

113
00:05:05,602 --> 00:05:07,804
as a community effort diminished, right?

114
00:05:07,804 --> 00:05:09,885
The games got bigger, the companies got bigger,

115
00:05:09,885 --> 00:05:11,947
players expected companies to take care of themselves,

116
00:05:11,947 --> 00:05:14,049
it wasn't about, hey, we're all getting together

117
00:05:14,467 --> 00:05:17,794
you know, be scrappy and sort of support our favorite devs,

118
00:05:17,794 --> 00:05:18,836
it actually became a business.

119
00:05:20,002 --> 00:05:22,203
And so at that point, subscription fees

120
00:05:22,203 --> 00:05:25,546
became even less attractive to players.

121
00:05:25,546 --> 00:05:29,970
Of course, I'm not suggesting that this is the only reason

122
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,532
that the industry made the shift from subscription fees

123
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:35,554
to free-to-play when we're talking about big PC MMOs,

124
00:05:35,554 --> 00:05:39,077
but it's more complex than that.

125
00:05:39,077 --> 00:05:40,258
But from a design perspective,

126
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:41,379
if we're just thinking about design,

127
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:42,840
subscription fees come from a place

128
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,723
of really weak customer value,

129
00:05:45,723 --> 00:05:47,484
and that contributed to them underperforming

130
00:05:47,484 --> 00:05:49,606
pretty significantly in the face of newer models.

131
00:05:50,835 --> 00:05:52,657
So many of you probably noticed,

132
00:05:52,657 --> 00:05:56,180
when we talked about the value of monthly subscription fees,

133
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,103
I left something out that might have seemed important to you

134
00:05:59,103 --> 00:06:02,046
and that was access to the game.

135
00:06:02,046 --> 00:06:05,509
And I did this because I wanna talk a little bit briefly

136
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:07,631
about inherent versus derived value.

137
00:06:08,642 --> 00:06:11,283
So items are systems with inherent value, right?

138
00:06:11,283 --> 00:06:13,224
They provide some benefit to the purchaser

139
00:06:13,224 --> 00:06:16,046
that was not created by the seller.

140
00:06:16,046 --> 00:06:18,507
An example of this is cosmetics, right?

141
00:06:18,507 --> 00:06:21,188
Like hats, players want to express themselves,

142
00:06:21,188 --> 00:06:22,609
they want to look the way they want to look,

143
00:06:22,609 --> 00:06:24,610
and the hat provides that all on its own.

144
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:28,432
Your game probably didn't invent the idea of hats.

145
00:06:28,432 --> 00:06:30,633
So you get that for free to some extent.

146
00:06:31,828 --> 00:06:36,055
So items or systems with derived value are once removed from their benefit.

147
00:06:36,055 --> 00:06:38,599
Monthly subscription fee is a really simple example.

148
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:41,544
The value is the game, not the subscription.

149
00:06:41,544 --> 00:06:45,710
The only reason the subscription has any value is because the seller decided to gate the

150
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,391
game behind it.

151
00:06:47,012 --> 00:06:51,476
This creates a situation where the opportunity cost evaluation that the purchaser is making

152
00:06:51,476 --> 00:06:53,598
is removed from the actual value.

153
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:57,721
And that puts a higher amount of pressure on the thing that you're purchasing to be

154
00:06:57,721 --> 00:06:58,521
that much better.

155
00:06:58,521 --> 00:07:01,204
The value needs to be clearer and it needs to be higher.

156
00:07:01,204 --> 00:07:03,826
I'm not saying derived value systems are inherently bad.

157
00:07:03,826 --> 00:07:05,567
Of course they're not.

158
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:07,068
Currency is a derived value system.

159
00:07:07,068 --> 00:07:08,670
They do a lot of really great things for us.

160
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,473
But you need to be aware that you don't really get that for free.

161
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:15,539
Once you remove the evaluation the player is making from the actual purchase that they're making,

162
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:17,161
you have to go a step further.

163
00:07:17,161 --> 00:07:20,266
You have to have more value for them than you normally would.

164
00:07:21,724 --> 00:07:24,045
The example of the monthly subscription fees,

165
00:07:24,045 --> 00:07:26,306
a few games did really, really well with this model.

166
00:07:26,306 --> 00:07:28,427
You know, in hindsight, a very small number,

167
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:30,368
but some of them did really well.

168
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:32,169
Because the value of those games became

169
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:35,671
such an overwhelming value proposition for the players

170
00:07:35,671 --> 00:07:38,352
that they were willing to basically do whatever it took

171
00:07:38,352 --> 00:07:39,213
to get access to the game.

172
00:07:39,753 --> 00:07:46,178
And a lot of that came down to cultural zeitgeist and social pressures and things like that

173
00:07:46,178 --> 00:07:49,400
and also the quality of the game, which is really high.

174
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,024
Now I assume that every game that released under this model kind of assumed that yeah,

175
00:07:54,024 --> 00:07:59,088
our game is so great that people will definitely jump through the subscription hoop to get

176
00:07:59,088 --> 00:07:59,308
to it.

177
00:07:59,858 --> 00:08:03,100
What's kind of ironic about that is they were probably right,

178
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,041
not about the subscription hoop,

179
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:08,423
but they were probably right about the value of their game.

180
00:08:08,423 --> 00:08:10,845
Because when we actually did make the transition in MMORPGs

181
00:08:10,845 --> 00:08:13,126
from monthly subscription fees to free to play,

182
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:15,587
a lot of games actually operated under both models.

183
00:08:15,587 --> 00:08:19,870
And pretty much all MMORPGs that even had

184
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,591
a little bit of success had a much higher average

185
00:08:22,591 --> 00:08:24,833
revenue per paying user a month than $15.

186
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,674
Like double, triple that.

187
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:31,879
Players were actually willing to pay a healthy amount of money, $15 a month, $30 a month,

188
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:36,263
to play those games because they valued those games and they valued the things in them.

189
00:08:36,263 --> 00:08:40,227
They just didn't really value the subscription fees.

190
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:44,412
In general, players actually make two really distinctive valuations.

191
00:08:44,412 --> 00:08:47,735
One happens before the purchase and one happens afterwards.

192
00:08:48,374 --> 00:08:50,496
Before the purchase, players rely on you

193
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:53,418
pretty much exclusively to communicate the value

194
00:08:53,418 --> 00:08:55,179
of the microtransaction item or system

195
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:56,600
that they're going to buy.

196
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,822
After the purchase, players evaluate

197
00:08:58,822 --> 00:09:01,224
how satisfied they are by that purchase.

198
00:09:01,224 --> 00:09:03,666
And a big part of that evaluation

199
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,847
is going to depend on the gap

200
00:09:05,847 --> 00:09:07,889
between what you promised them

201
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:09,230
and what they feel they were delivered.

202
00:09:10,177 --> 00:09:12,018
And you really need to get this right.

203
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:15,420
Because microtransactions absolutely 100% depend

204
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,340
on the second evaluation.

205
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,441
The first one's important, kind of,

206
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:20,262
you have a funnel you have to work on.

207
00:09:20,262 --> 00:09:21,823
But the second one is really key.

208
00:09:21,823 --> 00:09:23,384
They are microtransactions.

209
00:09:23,384 --> 00:09:25,325
We have to have repeat purchasing.

210
00:09:26,326 --> 00:09:28,408
So you really have to get that one right.

211
00:09:28,408 --> 00:09:30,309
And you can really hurt yourself a lot

212
00:09:30,309 --> 00:09:31,811
if you don't control the first one.

213
00:09:31,811 --> 00:09:34,152
There's a couple of ways this usually happens.

214
00:09:34,152 --> 00:09:37,495
One is implied value by marketing.

215
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:39,937
Right, so attempting to manufacture

216
00:09:39,937 --> 00:09:43,660
a usually vague kind of value for marketing,

217
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,782
like oh, this item is sort of associated

218
00:09:45,782 --> 00:09:48,524
with this good thing, and if I buy this item,

219
00:09:48,524 --> 00:09:50,146
then I'm gonna get more of that good thing.

220
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:53,173
This is a really common tactic to sort of juice up

221
00:09:53,173 --> 00:09:55,054
your first evaluation.

222
00:09:55,054 --> 00:09:58,236
Of course, a lot of times when this kind of idea

223
00:09:58,236 --> 00:10:00,457
is taken to an extreme, it's pretty absurd,

224
00:10:00,457 --> 00:10:01,978
it's pretty crazy to be like,

225
00:10:01,978 --> 00:10:03,659
man, if I just eat this Snickers bar,

226
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:07,061
then topless women will be everywhere.

227
00:10:07,061 --> 00:10:08,782
Obviously, that doesn't make any sense,

228
00:10:08,782 --> 00:10:09,883
but we do it all the time.

229
00:10:09,883 --> 00:10:13,625
And this really erodes player's trust.

230
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,246
It happens in microtransactions as well,

231
00:10:16,246 --> 00:10:18,608
sometimes not as extreme as those examples.

232
00:10:18,608 --> 00:10:19,508
But.

233
00:10:20,028 --> 00:10:22,330
It can be really simple things like,

234
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,711
oh, I'm gonna feature a pro player using this item

235
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:28,993
and just suggest that if a normal player used it,

236
00:10:28,993 --> 00:10:30,673
they would play as good as the pro player.

237
00:10:30,673 --> 00:10:33,475
Or it can also be really manipulative.

238
00:10:33,475 --> 00:10:35,576
I mean, you could say, we've doubled the drop rate

239
00:10:35,576 --> 00:10:37,237
on this item in a random box,

240
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:39,638
but you know that the double drop rate

241
00:10:39,638 --> 00:10:41,038
is still so incredibly low

242
00:10:41,038 --> 00:10:42,519
that the average player is never gonna get it.

243
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,329
You know, a lot of these things I'm talking about

244
00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:48,490
are actually pretty classic marketing techniques,

245
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,391
but that's not really a good argument for using them.

246
00:10:51,391 --> 00:10:54,453
Players don't care that other industries use them.

247
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:56,853
They just care how they feel when they're evaluating

248
00:10:56,853 --> 00:10:58,394
their purchase after they've made it.

249
00:11:00,057 --> 00:11:01,298
The second way this happens,

250
00:11:01,298 --> 00:11:03,020
happens a lot in microtransactions,

251
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,962
and that's obfuscating value.

252
00:11:04,962 --> 00:11:07,004
The most egregious form of this

253
00:11:07,004 --> 00:11:10,647
is intentionally making items or systems hard to understand

254
00:11:10,647 --> 00:11:12,248
because if they were clearly understood,

255
00:11:12,248 --> 00:11:15,451
the player wouldn't be seeing them

256
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:17,373
as valuable as you're selling them for.

257
00:11:17,986 --> 00:11:19,968
This can actually happen unintentionally too.

258
00:11:19,968 --> 00:11:24,874
Games are really complicated and if you have a game with a really complex progression system

259
00:11:24,874 --> 00:11:27,617
or a lot of complex systems in it, this can just happen.

260
00:11:27,617 --> 00:11:31,481
But whether you intended to do it or not, obfuscating value is pretty bad for player

261
00:11:31,481 --> 00:11:34,805
trust because, weirdly enough, people don't like to feel tricked.

262
00:11:36,152 --> 00:11:37,412
So let's talk about random boxes.

263
00:11:37,412 --> 00:11:40,012
When we're talking about obfuscating value,

264
00:11:40,012 --> 00:11:41,673
these are gonna come up.

265
00:11:41,673 --> 00:11:46,093
Remember, good design comes from satisfying player needs.

266
00:11:46,093 --> 00:11:50,154
And random boxes do fill some very specific player needs.

267
00:11:50,154 --> 00:11:52,714
But they're also incredibly easy to design

268
00:11:52,714 --> 00:11:55,235
in such a way that their value is really murky.

269
00:11:55,235 --> 00:11:58,035
And that can lead to confusion and eventually resentment.

270
00:11:58,035 --> 00:11:59,696
And once a player opens a random box

271
00:11:59,696 --> 00:12:00,836
and they feel ripped off,

272
00:12:00,836 --> 00:12:02,936
they are much less likely to buy another one

273
00:12:02,936 --> 00:12:04,357
in the long run.

274
00:12:05,376 --> 00:12:07,059
So how can we avoid this?

275
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,402
How do we design a better random box?

276
00:12:09,402 --> 00:12:11,025
So let's go back to our whys.

277
00:12:11,025 --> 00:12:13,128
Why do players buy random boxes?

278
00:12:14,482 --> 00:12:16,243
It's not because they love to gamble.

279
00:12:16,243 --> 00:12:19,303
I mean, it's part of an answer,

280
00:12:19,303 --> 00:12:21,144
it might feed into your design,

281
00:12:21,144 --> 00:12:23,944
but this is not an acceptable answer to this question

282
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:27,005
if you really want to dig into what motivates people.

283
00:12:27,005 --> 00:12:29,286
Sure, people do like to gamble,

284
00:12:29,286 --> 00:12:31,846
but they still don't buy things

285
00:12:31,846 --> 00:12:33,587
that don't have real value for them.

286
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:36,227
And adding a random element doesn't prevent people

287
00:12:36,227 --> 00:12:38,088
from evaluating their satisfaction

288
00:12:38,088 --> 00:12:40,668
after they've consumed your item.

289
00:12:40,668 --> 00:12:43,989
In fact, players are really sensitive to value outputs.

290
00:12:43,989 --> 00:12:44,069
So.

291
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:48,293
These are two random boxes from Guild Wars 2.

292
00:12:48,293 --> 00:12:50,154
The numbers aren't real, don't get too excited.

293
00:12:50,154 --> 00:12:54,558
But they are two random boxes from Guild Wars 2.

294
00:12:54,558 --> 00:12:57,821
They both cost $1 to purchase.

295
00:12:57,821 --> 00:13:01,104
Random Box A outputs about $1.50 on average

296
00:13:01,104 --> 00:13:03,926
when a person opens it, so the thing they get out of it

297
00:13:03,926 --> 00:13:05,508
is worth usually about $1.50.

298
00:13:05,508 --> 00:13:09,692
Random Box B has their output at about $1.75.

299
00:13:11,026 --> 00:13:13,647
So a really clear thing happened here.

300
00:13:13,647 --> 00:13:15,588
Random box A came out into the market

301
00:13:15,588 --> 00:13:17,428
and people were like, oh this is interesting.

302
00:13:17,428 --> 00:13:19,969
I've seen you talk about this and it looks kinda cool.

303
00:13:19,969 --> 00:13:22,710
I'm making my first evaluation, I'm gonna purchase it.

304
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:26,111
Then, pretty quickly, players obviously made an evaluation

305
00:13:26,111 --> 00:13:28,032
that this box was not worth it.

306
00:13:28,032 --> 00:13:30,853
They were not happy with it and sales went way down.

307
00:13:31,573 --> 00:13:34,854
Conversely, apparently, for this type of thing,

308
00:13:34,854 --> 00:13:35,674
$1.75 was the sweet spot,

309
00:13:35,674 --> 00:13:38,495
because when we released the second box,

310
00:13:38,495 --> 00:13:40,215
not only did it sell really well right away,

311
00:13:40,215 --> 00:13:41,636
and we already in that first week

312
00:13:41,636 --> 00:13:43,736
saw a lot of repeat purchasing,

313
00:13:43,736 --> 00:13:45,257
but then we got a word of mouth effect

314
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:47,797
where we had even new purchasers in the second week,

315
00:13:47,797 --> 00:13:50,178
and they became repeat purchasers as well,

316
00:13:50,178 --> 00:13:51,598
and it did significantly better.

317
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:54,919
The players didn't have access to the drop tables,

318
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:57,639
the players don't hear the $1.75 amount.

319
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:00,360
They're evaluating this based on just their satisfaction

320
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,280
after they open the box.

321
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,341
And it can be tricky to figure out exactly

322
00:14:03,341 --> 00:14:05,702
what's gonna be satisfying for players,

323
00:14:05,702 --> 00:14:07,742
but you need to be focused on trying to hit it.

324
00:14:07,742 --> 00:14:11,983
So, players are really sensitive to value, right?

325
00:14:11,983 --> 00:14:15,364
But where does that value come from, right?

326
00:14:15,364 --> 00:14:17,585
What do they want random boxes for?

327
00:14:17,585 --> 00:14:20,026
I said they satisfy a couple of specific demands,

328
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:20,586
so what are they?

329
00:14:20,586 --> 00:14:22,347
Well, they fall into two categories.

330
00:14:22,608 --> 00:14:24,429
The first is jackpots.

331
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:28,172
So in these random boxes, mostly what the player opens,

332
00:14:28,172 --> 00:14:29,413
when the player opens the box,

333
00:14:29,413 --> 00:14:32,635
they get sort of small, incremental, consumable rewards,

334
00:14:32,635 --> 00:14:33,976
but then there's a really small number,

335
00:14:33,976 --> 00:14:36,338
maybe even as low as one jackpot item

336
00:14:36,338 --> 00:14:38,199
that's really, really awesome that they're going for.

337
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,121
These boxes provide players a chance to get something

338
00:14:43,121 --> 00:14:45,381
that by necessity must be rare,

339
00:14:45,381 --> 00:14:48,302
if your game actually supports rarity markets,

340
00:14:48,302 --> 00:14:51,122
or they allow players to get something expensive

341
00:14:51,122 --> 00:14:52,643
for cheap if they're lucky.

342
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:54,963
That's the draw, that's the value

343
00:14:54,963 --> 00:14:56,463
for players buying this kind of box.

344
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:59,744
Balancing the price of an individual box

345
00:14:59,744 --> 00:15:02,265
versus the value of the jackpot

346
00:15:02,265 --> 00:15:05,465
is sort of the key for these boxes.

347
00:15:05,685 --> 00:15:09,188
The jackpot is the thing the players are evaluating you on.

348
00:15:09,188 --> 00:15:11,530
In these kind of boxes, the non-jackpot items,

349
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,651
they kind of just fall away.

350
00:15:12,651 --> 00:15:15,533
Players don't really see them as having value.

351
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:18,755
You may try to argue like, no, they're

352
00:15:18,755 --> 00:15:20,296
totally worth $0.25 or something apiece,

353
00:15:20,296 --> 00:15:23,699
but it doesn't actually affect the way people evaluate these.

354
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:25,920
They just look at the jackpot item.

355
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,103
So if a player looks at your jackpot,

356
00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:35,032
random box that cost a dollar a piece and they decide the jackpot item is worth $50 to them and

357
00:15:35,032 --> 00:15:39,238
then they don't get the jackpot item after spending $50, they're going to feel ripped off.

358
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:43,105
And they're not gonna wanna hear about rarity rates

359
00:15:43,105 --> 00:15:45,048
across the entire population.

360
00:15:45,048 --> 00:15:46,910
They're not gonna wanna hear about,

361
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,633
but on average you would have gotten it at that rate.

362
00:15:49,633 --> 00:15:51,916
They only really care about their own experience.

363
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,578
And so trying to hone in on figuring out

364
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,500
how players are going to value that jackpot

365
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,162
is sort of key to pricing these

366
00:15:57,162 --> 00:16:00,366
so that you get that great second week repeat purchasing.

367
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,441
The second type is grab bags.

368
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:08,224
These are random boxes where all of the items

369
00:16:08,224 --> 00:16:10,546
in the random box are pretty similar in value.

370
00:16:10,546 --> 00:16:15,249
They actually usually come out at a fairly even rate.

371
00:16:15,249 --> 00:16:18,091
Grab bags allow players to get something

372
00:16:18,091 --> 00:16:20,773
for a cheaper price when they don't have a strong preference

373
00:16:20,773 --> 00:16:22,974
for exactly what they want to get.

374
00:16:22,974 --> 00:16:24,915
So if players are like, I just want...

375
00:16:25,696 --> 00:16:30,401
customization options. I just want to have more things in my wardrobe, but I'm not really willing

376
00:16:30,401 --> 00:16:35,246
to pay a premium for a specific thing. Then they can open a grab bag and just get something random,

377
00:16:35,246 --> 00:16:36,127
and they're pretty happy.

378
00:16:37,155 --> 00:16:40,058
Players judge the value of these based on the entire content

379
00:16:40,058 --> 00:16:41,599
of the box, right?

380
00:16:41,599 --> 00:16:44,141
Is this set of things that I might get good?

381
00:16:44,141 --> 00:16:44,902
Do I want them?

382
00:16:44,902 --> 00:16:47,724
Would I be happy if any of them came out of the box?

383
00:16:47,724 --> 00:16:50,827
A good way to sort of price these,

384
00:16:50,827 --> 00:16:52,188
and we'll get later in the talk,

385
00:16:52,188 --> 00:16:54,069
I'll talk a lot more deeply about pricing,

386
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:56,792
but a good way to sort of find your value for these

387
00:16:56,792 --> 00:16:59,094
is to think about what is the lowest value item

388
00:16:59,094 --> 00:17:00,014
that comes out of the box,

389
00:17:00,014 --> 00:17:02,296
and is it still a good deal if I get that item

390
00:17:02,296 --> 00:17:03,417
when I open this box?

391
00:17:05,731 --> 00:17:09,076
Of course, random boxes do get used to satisfy other needs,

392
00:17:09,076 --> 00:17:10,457
and they might satisfy a need

393
00:17:10,457 --> 00:17:12,881
that's super specific to your game.

394
00:17:12,881 --> 00:17:15,665
But what's important is that you have a clear audience

395
00:17:15,665 --> 00:17:18,368
that sees clear value in your random box,

396
00:17:18,368 --> 00:17:20,551
and that you remember that random boxes

397
00:17:20,551 --> 00:17:22,914
cannot be used to satisfy every need.

398
00:17:23,735 --> 00:17:25,777
That's more of a developer need.

399
00:17:25,777 --> 00:17:27,278
That's not a player need.

400
00:17:27,278 --> 00:17:30,600
So there are some player needs they do satisfy really well

401
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,720
and they're great for that,

402
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,002
but we can't sort of force players to use them

403
00:17:34,002 --> 00:17:36,524
to satisfy other needs that they'd rather not use them for

404
00:17:36,524 --> 00:17:38,565
because that makes them angry.

405
00:17:38,565 --> 00:17:40,746
We've seen over the past year a couple of cases

406
00:17:40,746 --> 00:17:42,667
where pretty poorly designed random boxes

407
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:44,288
have caused a lot of player backlash

408
00:17:44,288 --> 00:17:46,670
in really high profile games.

409
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,871
And that backlash affects every game.

410
00:17:49,332 --> 00:17:51,695
even games that use random boxes well,

411
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:55,299
or you think, I designed my random boxes perfectly

412
00:17:55,299 --> 00:17:59,284
and I'm always thinking about my customer value.

413
00:17:59,284 --> 00:18:03,188
Those very high profile backlashes affect you too.

414
00:18:03,188 --> 00:18:05,571
Random boxes are really good at some stuff.

415
00:18:05,571 --> 00:18:07,814
They make some players really, really happy.

416
00:18:07,814 --> 00:18:08,855
Some players really like them.

417
00:18:09,175 --> 00:18:11,597
But if we abuse them, they're gonna become synonymous

418
00:18:11,597 --> 00:18:13,739
with cheap money grabs and we're gonna lose them.

419
00:18:13,739 --> 00:18:15,500
They really could just go away completely.

420
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,661
We could lose them out of our toolbox.

421
00:18:16,661 --> 00:18:17,702
It really wouldn't be that hard.

422
00:18:17,702 --> 00:18:20,764
We've definitely seen a similar kind of thing happen

423
00:18:20,764 --> 00:18:23,847
with other tactics and other options

424
00:18:23,847 --> 00:18:24,927
for game design in the past.

425
00:18:24,927 --> 00:18:27,149
So it's not out of our own possibility.

426
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:29,091
But avoiding that really comes down,

427
00:18:29,091 --> 00:18:31,152
like I said, to understanding what your players want

428
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:34,615
and what they value and player motivation.

429
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:35,515
So that's a good segue.

430
00:18:38,477 --> 00:18:40,078
We're not thinking about money right now,

431
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:41,719
we're just thinking about great design,

432
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:43,440
we're thinking about value,

433
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,061
but hey, how do you know what your players value, right?

434
00:18:47,061 --> 00:18:49,523
Why do people want things?

435
00:18:49,523 --> 00:18:51,224
We can zoom all the way back out

436
00:18:51,224 --> 00:18:54,025
and just talk about why people do things at all.

437
00:18:54,705 --> 00:18:57,068
And lucky for us, there's been a ton of research

438
00:18:57,068 --> 00:18:59,430
into why people do things, human motivation.

439
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,553
And since we're talking about video games,

440
00:19:02,553 --> 00:19:04,335
we don't have to worry about basic motivations

441
00:19:04,335 --> 00:19:06,397
like food and shelter, because most people

442
00:19:06,397 --> 00:19:09,840
don't use video games to satisfy those needs, thank God.

443
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,202
And we can just focus on models that deal with

444
00:19:12,202 --> 00:19:14,705
more high-level human motivations.

445
00:19:15,517 --> 00:19:20,282
And I actually like this, it's actually sort of helpful for me to remember that when we

446
00:19:20,282 --> 00:19:25,647
sell things in video games, we sell microtransactions, we're not selling anything that anyone truly

447
00:19:25,647 --> 00:19:26,768
needs.

448
00:19:26,768 --> 00:19:31,172
So when people decide to buy things that we make, they're making a really free evaluation

449
00:19:31,172 --> 00:19:35,896
that's pure and they're deciding just based on how good is this item and how happy does

450
00:19:35,896 --> 00:19:36,456
it make me.

451
00:19:36,456 --> 00:19:37,337
I kind of think that's great.

452
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,461
So there's a bunch of models for high-level human motivation,

453
00:19:43,461 --> 00:19:45,922
but we're gonna use self-determination theory

454
00:19:45,922 --> 00:19:49,203
because this is GDC.

455
00:19:49,203 --> 00:19:51,503
And I figure a lot of you are familiar with it.

456
00:19:51,503 --> 00:19:52,724
I also like it, right?

457
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:56,064
It's pretty great because it's all about

458
00:19:56,064 --> 00:19:58,785
these high-level motivations and it really cares about

459
00:19:58,785 --> 00:20:00,745
the kinds of things that drive people to

460
00:20:00,745 --> 00:20:03,246
put a lot of time and effort into stuff

461
00:20:03,246 --> 00:20:05,507
that might not seem like it has any sort of obvious,

462
00:20:05,507 --> 00:20:07,167
extrinsic value to them.

463
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:11,829
And its focus on that kind of intrinsic motivation

464
00:20:11,829 --> 00:20:15,950
makes it really, really suited for doing design work

465
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:19,291
around rewards, progression, and monetization,

466
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,392
which is great.

467
00:20:20,392 --> 00:20:23,052
For anybody that doesn't know, just really, really quick,

468
00:20:23,052 --> 00:20:27,554
STD tells us that many high-level human behaviors

469
00:20:27,554 --> 00:20:29,495
are driven by intrinsic motivators

470
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:32,396
and not extrinsic rewards and punishments.

471
00:20:33,116 --> 00:20:39,102
Further, intrinsic motivators exist to satisfy mostly three high-band human needs, the need

472
00:20:39,102 --> 00:20:42,286
for autonomy, the need for mastery, and the need for relatedness.

473
00:20:42,286 --> 00:20:48,192
So when we look at microtransactions, we can break a lot of them down into these three

474
00:20:48,192 --> 00:20:48,832
categories.

475
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:54,458
So here's a list of some examples of the kinds of things that satisfy the mastery need, the

476
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,620
autonomy need, the relatedness need.

477
00:20:57,276 --> 00:20:58,657
So that's actually pretty simple, right?

478
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:01,680
If your microtransaction just satisfies one of these needs,

479
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,103
then you're doing great, and it's gonna have value,

480
00:21:05,103 --> 00:21:05,924
and people are gonna buy it.

481
00:21:05,924 --> 00:21:09,707
Cool, but what needs are best suited

482
00:21:09,707 --> 00:21:11,769
to be met by microtransactions?

483
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:13,530
And should you try to meet all of them

484
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:14,771
with your microtransactions,

485
00:21:14,771 --> 00:21:17,494
or should you only try to meet some of them?

486
00:21:17,494 --> 00:21:20,817
Should you try to meet the same ones

487
00:21:20,817 --> 00:21:23,659
that your game is meeting with other means?

488
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:24,500
All of this stuff is,

489
00:21:25,221 --> 00:21:27,823
somewhat dependent on the exact game that you're making,

490
00:21:27,823 --> 00:21:30,585
but let's go through some sort of core guidelines.

491
00:21:32,069 --> 00:21:36,790
So aligning your motivations with your core gameplay

492
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,790
can give you a lot of great synergy.

493
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,951
For example, collectible card games all by themselves

494
00:21:41,951 --> 00:21:44,031
offer a lot of autonomy satisfaction, right?

495
00:21:44,031 --> 00:21:47,132
The more cards you get, the more options you have in battle

496
00:21:47,132 --> 00:21:49,392
and that makes you feel like you're more free

497
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:51,093
and you have more choices.

498
00:21:51,093 --> 00:21:52,573
You could sell card packs.

499
00:21:52,573 --> 00:21:55,793
That also increases the autonomy satisfaction.

500
00:21:55,793 --> 00:21:58,574
This is the classic model that Magic the Gathering uses.

501
00:21:59,415 --> 00:22:04,849
Both their core loop of collecting cards and their business model revolves around satisfying

502
00:22:04,849 --> 00:22:06,473
an autonomy motivation.

503
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:11,042
But complementing your core gameplay need satisfaction

504
00:22:11,042 --> 00:22:12,924
can also be successful.

505
00:22:12,924 --> 00:22:15,306
When collectible card games moved more

506
00:22:15,306 --> 00:22:17,948
into the digital realm, we see more of them

507
00:22:17,948 --> 00:22:20,570
try to also satisfy the relatedness need

508
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:23,753
by offering like avatars and custom borders

509
00:22:23,753 --> 00:22:25,074
and things like that.

510
00:22:25,074 --> 00:22:27,256
And that usually gets filled entirely by microtransactions

511
00:22:27,256 --> 00:22:28,937
because the core of the game just doesn't

512
00:22:28,937 --> 00:22:30,358
really offer much of that.

513
00:22:30,358 --> 00:22:31,860
It offers a little bit, but not much.

514
00:22:33,502 --> 00:22:35,822
You need to watch out for some cultural biases here.

515
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:38,143
There's some pitfalls.

516
00:22:38,143 --> 00:22:41,003
If your core gameplay mechanic is aimed at satisfying

517
00:22:41,003 --> 00:22:43,724
the mastery need, and a lot of them are,

518
00:22:43,724 --> 00:22:46,325
because games tend to focus pretty heavily

519
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:49,146
on the mastery need, and your intended audience

520
00:22:49,146 --> 00:22:52,887
is largely Western, you may want to avoid selling items

521
00:22:52,887 --> 00:22:54,807
that satisfy the mastery need as well,

522
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:58,948
because traditionally, Western cultures are uncomfortable

523
00:22:58,948 --> 00:23:02,529
with the idea of money being exchanged to gain mastery.

524
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,844
especially in context where mastery is seen as earned.

525
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,966
We really value effort.

526
00:23:08,966 --> 00:23:11,810
And when you start to create a situation

527
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:16,174
in which we say effort equals this signifier of mastery,

528
00:23:16,174 --> 00:23:18,136
if you sell that as well,

529
00:23:18,136 --> 00:23:20,059
you're gonna trigger some very deep-seated

530
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:21,040
cultural resentment.

531
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:24,651
basically you're gonna make it feel unfair.

532
00:23:24,651 --> 00:23:26,272
So an example, a real world example,

533
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:28,354
is if you had a fighting game,

534
00:23:28,354 --> 00:23:30,535
and as players won matches,

535
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:31,556
their fighters leveled up

536
00:23:31,556 --> 00:23:33,217
and they had a number associated with them

537
00:23:33,217 --> 00:23:34,738
and they became more powerful,

538
00:23:34,738 --> 00:23:36,980
the more matches they won,

539
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,642
and then you sold away to increase that number as well.

540
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:42,963
most Western audiences would think that was pretty unfair

541
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:46,984
because you already set up a situation in which that number is a signifier of ability

542
00:23:46,984 --> 00:23:50,205
and it's a signifier of effort, it's a signifier of wins.

543
00:23:50,205 --> 00:23:54,266
And so you're muddying the water, you're making that signifier not mean as much,

544
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,427
you're making it difficult for people to understand what mastery really means in your game.

545
00:23:58,067 --> 00:24:00,249
You could maybe argue that that microtransaction

546
00:24:00,249 --> 00:24:02,371
that I just described is actually providing

547
00:24:02,371 --> 00:24:03,392
an autonomy satisfaction,

548
00:24:03,392 --> 00:24:05,353
because you're trading time for money,

549
00:24:05,353 --> 00:24:07,575
and traditionally we think time for money trades

550
00:24:07,575 --> 00:24:11,878
are autonomy satisfaction meters.

551
00:24:11,878 --> 00:24:15,001
But if that's true, you need to make that clear.

552
00:24:15,001 --> 00:24:17,863
The example I just gave, as I said, very muddy.

553
00:24:17,863 --> 00:24:20,265
Like, I don't understand what this number means anymore,

554
00:24:20,265 --> 00:24:22,286
I don't really understand where my mastery level is at.

555
00:24:22,644 --> 00:24:24,506
So if you want to trade time for money, go for it.

556
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:26,429
But make sure you make it really clear to the player

557
00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:28,352
that you're not replacing mastery.

558
00:24:30,345 --> 00:24:37,290
There are examples of selling mastery satisfaction really well in a way that doesn't feel inherently

559
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:37,791
unfair.

560
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:39,672
I'll give you one.

561
00:24:39,672 --> 00:24:46,298
The MMORPG Blade and Soul, which is made by NCSoft, has a system of weapon upgrades that

562
00:24:46,298 --> 00:24:49,860
requires the player to acquire a whole lot of a specific resource in order to upgrade

563
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,901
their weapon.

564
00:24:50,901 --> 00:24:53,583
They can go out and get that resource in the game, or they can buy it.

565
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:56,341
and you just purchase it from their store.

566
00:24:56,341 --> 00:24:57,862
But once they have all the resource,

567
00:24:57,862 --> 00:24:59,823
the weapon does not actually get upgraded

568
00:24:59,823 --> 00:25:03,126
unless they beat a boss monster with the weapon.

569
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,687
So yeah, you can speed up the process

570
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:05,888
of gathering your resource,

571
00:25:05,888 --> 00:25:07,209
but the thing that you're sort of signifying

572
00:25:07,209 --> 00:25:08,149
in the player's mind,

573
00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:10,091
the thing that makes the weapon get upgraded,

574
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:11,392
is beating that boss monster.

575
00:25:11,392 --> 00:25:13,293
And that fulfills a very satisfying,

576
00:25:13,293 --> 00:25:15,115
intrinsic mastery need as well.

577
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,472
You also want to understand what needs your game's

578
00:25:19,472 --> 00:25:22,454
reward systems are going to be aiming to satisfy,

579
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,736
as attempting to satisfy the exact same needs

580
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:27,398
with rewards and microtransactions can lead

581
00:25:27,398 --> 00:25:29,300
to the two systems fighting with each other.

582
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,322
We suffer from this problem pretty significantly

583
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:31,982
on Guild Wars 2.

584
00:25:33,425 --> 00:25:37,027
So because in Guild Wars 2 there's no stat increases

585
00:25:37,027 --> 00:25:38,989
on gear at the end game,

586
00:25:38,989 --> 00:25:41,870
rewards for high-level content are mostly cosmetic.

587
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:45,313
We also sell a lot of cosmetics for microtransactions.

588
00:25:45,313 --> 00:25:48,435
This creates a situation where our most dedicated players

589
00:25:48,435 --> 00:25:51,117
are motivated to complete the high-level content

590
00:25:51,117 --> 00:25:52,438
by the cosmetic rewards.

591
00:25:52,438 --> 00:25:54,339
They are intrinsically not motivated

592
00:25:54,339 --> 00:25:58,161
to purchase microtransactions for cosmetic microtransactions

593
00:25:58,161 --> 00:25:59,522
and vice versa.

594
00:25:59,522 --> 00:26:01,684
They're fundamentally just sort of fighting with each other.

595
00:26:03,578 --> 00:26:05,379
We've alleviated this a little bit over time

596
00:26:05,379 --> 00:26:08,200
by sort of carving off types of cosmetics

597
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,581
for rewards only and types of cosmetics

598
00:26:10,581 --> 00:26:12,902
for microtransactions only, but it's really not ideal.

599
00:26:12,902 --> 00:26:16,703
And it makes things particularly difficult

600
00:26:16,703 --> 00:26:20,505
for the next section, which is pricing.

601
00:26:20,505 --> 00:26:23,226
Because it is confusing for players

602
00:26:23,226 --> 00:26:26,667
when something is worth effort, but it's also worth dollars.

603
00:26:27,975 --> 00:26:30,760
So we've been talking about designing microtransactions

604
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,825
and just thinking about value in this really abstract way,

605
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,909
and now we're gonna take it into a very concrete world

606
00:26:35,909 --> 00:26:38,453
and we're gonna talk about putting real currency values

607
00:26:38,453 --> 00:26:39,455
on your microtransactions.

608
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:44,512
In this section, you're gonna see a lot of these graphs.

609
00:26:44,512 --> 00:26:48,495
This is a type of demand curve,

610
00:26:48,495 --> 00:26:50,357
but it's probably not what you're used to seeing

611
00:26:50,357 --> 00:26:52,439
just from a microeconomics textbook.

612
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:56,022
There's no supply curve because we don't need it

613
00:26:56,022 --> 00:26:57,883
and we don't care about it.

614
00:26:57,883 --> 00:26:58,904
I can get into exactly why,

615
00:26:58,904 --> 00:27:00,145
but it's not important to us right now.

616
00:27:00,145 --> 00:27:02,607
The blue line is gonna be demand.

617
00:27:02,607 --> 00:27:05,169
That's just how many people or how many units

618
00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:07,971
would you sell at the price, which is down at the bottom.

619
00:27:08,632 --> 00:27:11,012
I've added the white line which is revenue,

620
00:27:11,012 --> 00:27:13,053
just to make it a lot easier to see

621
00:27:13,053 --> 00:27:17,054
where those, how those different prices affect

622
00:27:17,054 --> 00:27:19,174
your overall output for selling the item.

623
00:27:19,174 --> 00:27:20,915
So just traditionally in economics

624
00:27:20,915 --> 00:27:23,976
you wouldn't really see revenue graphed that way,

625
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,336
but we're gonna do it here just to make it really easy

626
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:29,257
for you guys to grok quickly where the highest

627
00:27:29,257 --> 00:27:31,158
revenue generating price is on each graph.

628
00:27:33,427 --> 00:27:35,370
Microeconomics basically tells us

629
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:37,853
that pricing is really, really easy.

630
00:27:37,853 --> 00:27:40,035
You just gotta plot this demand curve

631
00:27:40,035 --> 00:27:41,597
against a bunch of possible prices,

632
00:27:41,597 --> 00:27:44,441
and then, cool, we make our little white line,

633
00:27:44,441 --> 00:27:46,744
we see where the peak is, that's it.

634
00:27:46,744 --> 00:27:47,545
You've got a price.

635
00:27:48,526 --> 00:27:49,006
So simple.

636
00:27:49,006 --> 00:27:52,549
Unfortunately, forecasting demand to this resolution

637
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:55,652
is really, really hard, especially if you don't have

638
00:27:55,652 --> 00:27:57,773
really specific historical data.

639
00:27:57,773 --> 00:28:00,936
And pricing can be unintuitive because you don't always

640
00:28:00,936 --> 00:28:04,799
know actually what demand curve you are plotting.

641
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:05,340
As an example.

642
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:07,899
Virtual currency bundles.

643
00:28:07,899 --> 00:28:10,362
So virtual currency bundles, in case you don't know,

644
00:28:10,362 --> 00:28:12,344
are hard currency.

645
00:28:12,344 --> 00:28:13,826
Basically, in a lot of games,

646
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:15,988
the player can purchase a currency

647
00:28:15,988 --> 00:28:18,050
that they can then use to buy microtransactions.

648
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:20,212
Instead of having the player pull their wallet out

649
00:28:20,212 --> 00:28:22,495
every time they wanna buy a hat or a booster

650
00:28:22,495 --> 00:28:23,616
or every little thing,

651
00:28:23,616 --> 00:28:26,839
instead you sell them big bundles of your virtual currency

652
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,301
that they can then spend on little.

653
00:28:28,681 --> 00:28:30,162
micro-transactions as they wish.

654
00:28:30,162 --> 00:28:32,243
A lot of games use this system.

655
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:35,665
And virtual currency bundles seem like they should have

656
00:28:35,665 --> 00:28:37,846
the most traditional demand curve in the world.

657
00:28:37,846 --> 00:28:41,088
They're just such a pure, there's such a pure demand

658
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:43,930
for them, because they are themselves

659
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:44,630
just an abstracted currency.

660
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:47,652
So, the higher the price, the less people

661
00:28:47,652 --> 00:28:48,592
are gonna be willing to buy it.

662
00:28:48,592 --> 00:28:50,033
The lower the price, the more people

663
00:28:50,033 --> 00:28:50,954
are gonna be willing to buy it.

664
00:28:50,954 --> 00:28:53,035
This seems really obvious, and I actually see

665
00:28:53,035 --> 00:28:56,197
most games just operate on this principle automatically,

666
00:28:56,197 --> 00:28:57,657
assuming this is absolutely true.

667
00:28:58,318 --> 00:29:01,322
Actually though, virtual currency bundle demand curves

668
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,223
look like this.

669
00:29:03,793 --> 00:29:08,336
So, they're really different than that traditional demand curve.

670
00:29:08,336 --> 00:29:14,702
They're highly inelastic, actually, which it seems like they shouldn't be.

671
00:29:14,702 --> 00:29:16,203
That's very odd.

672
00:29:16,203 --> 00:29:22,088
So, let's dig into why, and I'll talk a little bit about this graph specifically to illustrate

673
00:29:22,088 --> 00:29:22,448
this.

674
00:29:22,448 --> 00:29:29,333
This graph is based on this set of data, which is obfuscated, but it comes from a game called

675
00:29:29,453 --> 00:29:32,454
that I worked on in which we ran a little experiment

676
00:29:32,454 --> 00:29:34,875
on our virtual currency bundle offerings.

677
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:37,136
So we just looked at first time purchasers

678
00:29:37,136 --> 00:29:39,336
so we didn't sort of muddy the data

679
00:29:39,336 --> 00:29:41,717
with people coming in a second time.

680
00:29:41,717 --> 00:29:43,338
But basically on week one,

681
00:29:43,338 --> 00:29:45,078
we offered all of these different

682
00:29:45,078 --> 00:29:47,119
virtual currency bundle offers from $1 to $100.

683
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,360
Then on week two, we took away the $1 offer

684
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,721
and on week three, we took away the $5 offer.

685
00:29:54,725 --> 00:29:57,487
And I know this is a lot to digest quickly,

686
00:29:57,487 --> 00:29:59,829
but what this graph is telling us

687
00:29:59,829 --> 00:30:02,491
is that about 70% of first-time purchasers

688
00:30:02,491 --> 00:30:05,373
always purchase the cheapest bundle available.

689
00:30:05,373 --> 00:30:08,296
But when the cheapest bundle available

690
00:30:08,296 --> 00:30:09,837
is set to a higher price,

691
00:30:09,837 --> 00:30:11,658
doesn't significantly change their behavior.

692
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:15,941
You don't really gain any additional purchasers

693
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:17,302
by having the cheaper bundle.

694
00:30:17,302 --> 00:30:20,765
People are just gonna buy whichever one is the cheapest

695
00:30:20,765 --> 00:30:21,906
that they come across.

696
00:30:21,906 --> 00:30:23,567
And that seems really weird.

697
00:30:23,567 --> 00:30:25,469
And you might be like, wow, you just had

698
00:30:25,469 --> 00:30:29,071
some really weird game that had this crazy thing happen,

699
00:30:29,071 --> 00:30:31,513
but no, it seems like this is pretty much true

700
00:30:31,513 --> 00:30:32,454
across the board.

701
00:30:32,454 --> 00:30:36,657
It is true for every game I've ever worked on, for sure.

702
00:30:36,657 --> 00:30:39,539
But also, back in 2012, Emily Greer from Congregate,

703
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:39,940
which is an...

704
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,461
There used to be solely web-based game portal.

705
00:30:43,461 --> 00:30:45,842
They've branched out to a couple of other platforms.

706
00:30:45,842 --> 00:30:48,303
They have lots of games on their platform.

707
00:30:48,303 --> 00:30:50,583
She presented a bunch of data for 150 of their games

708
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:55,565
which showed that yeah, this is the virtual currency

709
00:30:55,565 --> 00:30:57,066
demand curve for pretty much everything.

710
00:30:57,066 --> 00:31:00,047
So why, that doesn't really make any sense.

711
00:31:00,047 --> 00:31:02,247
Well, the thing is that it's not

712
00:31:02,247 --> 00:31:03,788
the virtual currency demand curve.

713
00:31:03,788 --> 00:31:07,849
It's the fifth step in the funnel demand curve.

714
00:31:09,714 --> 00:31:12,056
We are not really getting to find out

715
00:31:12,056 --> 00:31:15,238
what motivates people who just want virtual currency

716
00:31:15,238 --> 00:31:18,020
because we had them go through all of these steps

717
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,641
to get to the point where they chose

718
00:31:19,641 --> 00:31:21,262
which bundle they were gonna buy.

719
00:31:21,262 --> 00:31:22,743
Some people have messed around with this

720
00:31:22,743 --> 00:31:24,665
a little bit on mobile and done some really cool things

721
00:31:24,665 --> 00:31:27,166
where they actually have you pick your bundle first

722
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:29,028
and that actually helps alleviate this problem.

723
00:31:29,028 --> 00:31:31,930
But the funnel still ends up churning out

724
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,170
a lot of potential purchasers

725
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,672
and it mostly churns out the people

726
00:31:34,672 --> 00:31:37,293
who are interested in only buying the cheapest option.

727
00:31:37,774 --> 00:31:39,776
So by the time they actually get to the point

728
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,118
where they're making the purchase,

729
00:31:41,118 --> 00:31:43,140
you've already lost most of the people

730
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,521
that you could sell a $1 bundle to.

731
00:31:44,521 --> 00:31:46,343
That's actually unfortunate.

732
00:31:46,343 --> 00:31:47,425
I wish it wasn't true.

733
00:31:47,425 --> 00:31:49,867
We should all be working on making this funnel better,

734
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:51,769
and it is getting better over time, but it is true,

735
00:31:51,769 --> 00:31:54,012
and if you're actually gonna make decisions

736
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:57,155
based on a demand curve,

737
00:31:57,996 --> 00:32:03,103
better know that you're making a decision based on this demand curve and not this demand

738
00:32:03,103 --> 00:32:08,749
curve. And that can be a little bit tricky if you just look at the surface level. So.

739
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:11,911
Demand curves are tricky, yes.

740
00:32:11,911 --> 00:32:15,153
And if you're introducing an entirely new class

741
00:32:15,153 --> 00:32:16,654
of microtransactions into your game,

742
00:32:16,654 --> 00:32:18,716
or you're launching your game for the first time,

743
00:32:18,716 --> 00:32:20,337
you're gonna have to figure out

744
00:32:20,337 --> 00:32:23,479
how you are going to figure out how to price them,

745
00:32:23,479 --> 00:32:25,321
because you don't have any historical data

746
00:32:25,321 --> 00:32:27,642
to build your demand curve off of.

747
00:32:27,642 --> 00:32:31,485
So let's just walk through a fictional example,

748
00:32:31,485 --> 00:32:33,686
step by step, on putting a price

749
00:32:33,686 --> 00:32:35,388
on a microtransaction item that's new.

750
00:32:36,309 --> 00:32:37,930
So in this example, we're gonna say

751
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:39,891
that you have a racing game,

752
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,972
and that game is heavily focused on players

753
00:32:41,972 --> 00:32:44,494
creating custom paint jobs for their cars.

754
00:32:44,494 --> 00:32:46,435
It's a big part of the game,

755
00:32:46,435 --> 00:32:47,976
and you've designed a microtransaction

756
00:32:47,976 --> 00:32:52,078
that allows players to store multiple paint jobs per car

757
00:32:52,078 --> 00:32:53,999
and just switch between them at will.

758
00:32:53,999 --> 00:32:55,800
So that's a pretty cool microtransaction

759
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,663
that fits into your primary motivation, awesome.

760
00:33:00,163 --> 00:33:03,707
So, first, to figure out how to plot this demand curve,

761
00:33:03,707 --> 00:33:05,690
we just need to figure out what kind of demand curve it is,

762
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,712
because there's two basic types of demand curve.

763
00:33:07,712 --> 00:33:10,035
There's elastic, and there's inelastic.

764
00:33:10,903 --> 00:33:13,103
So elastic demand curves are what you probably think of

765
00:33:13,103 --> 00:33:14,404
when you think of demand curves, right?

766
00:33:14,404 --> 00:33:17,024
This is the thing that's like guns and butter

767
00:33:17,024 --> 00:33:19,385
in your like microeconomics class in college.

768
00:33:19,385 --> 00:33:22,485
You're like, yeah, if more people wanna buy it,

769
00:33:22,485 --> 00:33:25,246
if it's cheaper, and that's true for some things.

770
00:33:25,246 --> 00:33:28,007
There are some things that have sort of a universal appeal.

771
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:32,448
An example in games for this is boosters in games

772
00:33:32,448 --> 00:33:35,228
with number-based progression, right?

773
00:33:35,228 --> 00:33:37,369
Would people like their progression to go faster?

774
00:33:37,369 --> 00:33:39,689
Yeah, pretty much everyone would use a booster

775
00:33:39,689 --> 00:33:40,230
if they had it.

776
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:47,737
But whether they're going to buy it is based almost solely on whether they think the price you're charging for it is worth their

777
00:33:47,737 --> 00:33:52,983
benefit. And the lower your price is, the more people who are going to decide, yeah, that's totally worth my benefits.

778
00:33:52,983 --> 00:33:58,148
It's a really basic demand curve. But there's a lot of things that actually have an inelastic demand curve.

779
00:33:58,148 --> 00:34:03,093
This is a curve in which changing the price doesn't significantly affect the number of people who are going to buy it.

780
00:34:04,303 --> 00:34:06,565
This happens a lot with things that have a niche demand.

781
00:34:06,565 --> 00:34:11,809
A good example in video games is cosmetic items.

782
00:34:11,809 --> 00:34:14,711
If your game offers me the ability to change my head

783
00:34:14,711 --> 00:34:16,713
into a pumpkin, and I hate pumpkins,

784
00:34:16,713 --> 00:34:18,975
and it doesn't matter how cheap that pumpkin head is,

785
00:34:18,975 --> 00:34:20,055
I'm never gonna want it.

786
00:34:20,836 --> 00:34:23,117
But if the only thing I care about is pumpkins,

787
00:34:23,117 --> 00:34:24,198
and I'm obsessed with pumpkins,

788
00:34:24,198 --> 00:34:26,199
and I need to make my character the pumpkin queen,

789
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,500
then I'm gonna be willing to pay quite a lot of money

790
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,481
to change my head into a pumpkin,

791
00:34:29,481 --> 00:34:31,002
because that's gonna go a long way

792
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:33,343
to satisfying my very specific need.

793
00:34:33,343 --> 00:34:35,144
So your pumpkin item is actually gonna have

794
00:34:35,144 --> 00:34:36,505
a pretty inelastic demand curve.

795
00:34:36,545 --> 00:34:39,706
The size of your market is gonna be smaller,

796
00:34:39,706 --> 00:34:42,947
but the people in it are not gonna stop buying your item

797
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:45,628
until it gets relatively expensive,

798
00:34:45,628 --> 00:34:47,249
and people who don't inherently want your item

799
00:34:47,249 --> 00:34:48,469
aren't gonna enter the market

800
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:49,669
until it's really, really cheap.

801
00:34:49,669 --> 00:34:51,410
So that's an inelastic demand curve.

802
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:54,151
Our example item, this paint job storage item,

803
00:34:54,151 --> 00:34:56,392
is actually somewhere in the middle.

804
00:34:56,392 --> 00:34:58,653
It's gonna tend to be a bit inelastic.

805
00:34:59,444 --> 00:35:02,325
Because you are cutting your market off a little

806
00:35:02,325 --> 00:35:05,526
in that if someone is playing this game of yours

807
00:35:05,526 --> 00:35:07,946
and they don't want more than one paint job for a car,

808
00:35:07,946 --> 00:35:10,347
they're never gonna want your item.

809
00:35:10,347 --> 00:35:12,128
So it's not universally appealing.

810
00:35:12,128 --> 00:35:15,008
So it's gonna be inherently a little bit inelastic.

811
00:35:15,008 --> 00:35:18,789
But since we said that one of the core motivations

812
00:35:18,789 --> 00:35:22,090
in your game is customization and personal expression,

813
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:23,031
you're gonna have a lot of people

814
00:35:23,031 --> 00:35:24,611
who are interested in this item

815
00:35:24,611 --> 00:35:28,252
and it's gonna be at least somewhat elastic.

816
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:31,693
I talked a little bit just now about size of market

817
00:35:31,693 --> 00:35:33,614
and that is your next big consideration.

818
00:35:33,614 --> 00:35:37,055
So how many people could even ever want this item?

819
00:35:37,055 --> 00:35:39,917
We start by saying like if this item was free,

820
00:35:39,917 --> 00:35:41,078
how many people would want it?

821
00:35:41,078 --> 00:35:44,680
And if any of you have ever designed rewards in a game,

822
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,781
you know that free does not mean everybody wants it.

823
00:35:47,781 --> 00:35:51,463
There's still a demand curve for stuff that's free.

824
00:35:51,463 --> 00:35:52,384
So, but it's pretty simple.

825
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:53,884
So we just use this simple kind of chart.

826
00:35:54,445 --> 00:35:57,268
how big is the market, how many people are gonna want it.

827
00:35:57,268 --> 00:36:00,051
And we also look at how that relates to elastic and inelastic

828
00:36:00,051 --> 00:36:02,675
because if you have an item that almost nobody wants,

829
00:36:02,675 --> 00:36:04,897
but it's really elastic, that means you're gonna be selling

830
00:36:04,897 --> 00:36:07,220
very few of them for a very low price,

831
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,501
you might not wanna do that.

832
00:36:08,501 --> 00:36:09,983
You might be okay with it, it depends,

833
00:36:09,983 --> 00:36:13,367
but it's usually, that quadrant's usually not so fantastic

834
00:36:13,367 --> 00:36:14,368
for return on investment.

835
00:36:15,349 --> 00:36:21,515
Our paint storage item has got a smaller market because as I said it's only people who want more than one paint job.

836
00:36:21,515 --> 00:36:26,420
We've cut everyone else out of that market and it's sort of here in the middle of elastic and inelastic.

837
00:36:28,388 --> 00:36:32,291
So, now that we know that, we can get the shape of our demand curve.

838
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:36,974
Okay, you know, we kind of know the size of the market, so we can plot that.

839
00:36:36,974 --> 00:36:41,878
And we also kind of know the shape of the elasticity, so we can plot that.

840
00:36:41,878 --> 00:36:45,461
We still don't really know what our possible prices are, though, and how exactly they're

841
00:36:45,461 --> 00:36:48,243
going to affect demand, and that one is tricky.

842
00:36:49,304 --> 00:36:53,685
Figuring that out usually involves a lot of research and maybe some forecasting if you

843
00:36:53,685 --> 00:36:55,405
have that available to you.

844
00:36:55,405 --> 00:37:00,026
You're going to want to look at a couple of things, particularly what is your average

845
00:37:00,026 --> 00:37:04,688
revenue per paying user for whatever time period you usually look at.

846
00:37:04,688 --> 00:37:09,289
Some games look at average revenue per paying user a day, average revenue per paying user

847
00:37:09,289 --> 00:37:11,610
a week, average revenue per paying user a month.

848
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:14,671
You want to use that as a baseline because if you're like,

849
00:37:14,671 --> 00:37:17,733
in general, we expect people to spend about $10 a week

850
00:37:17,733 --> 00:37:20,754
on our game, and you introduce an item that costs $15,

851
00:37:20,754 --> 00:37:25,056
you are asking players to pay more than you expect them

852
00:37:25,056 --> 00:37:27,478
on average to pay in a week for one item.

853
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:30,419
And you got to have an idea of how that's going

854
00:37:30,419 --> 00:37:32,600
to affect your overall market.

855
00:37:33,505 --> 00:37:35,566
So you can look at some projections for that.

856
00:37:35,566 --> 00:37:37,627
You can also look at some comparable titles,

857
00:37:37,627 --> 00:37:39,767
you know, look what other people are doing in the space.

858
00:37:39,767 --> 00:37:41,428
There is enough free to play stuff

859
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:43,989
that you're probably not making something

860
00:37:43,989 --> 00:37:45,409
that can't fall into some category.

861
00:37:45,409 --> 00:37:46,830
You wanna do this anyway

862
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:48,390
because your players play other games

863
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:50,151
and if you try to say,

864
00:37:50,151 --> 00:37:52,471
hats in our game cost $100 a piece.

865
00:37:52,872 --> 00:37:54,293
You better have a really good reason for that

866
00:37:54,293 --> 00:37:56,514
because that is not the baseline people are used to paying.

867
00:37:56,514 --> 00:37:58,075
So using those two things,

868
00:37:58,075 --> 00:38:01,117
just looking at what your projections are for the game,

869
00:38:01,117 --> 00:38:05,040
what the market is, we can at least get a good idea.

870
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,681
It's not gonna be perfect, it's not gonna be exact,

871
00:38:06,681 --> 00:38:08,762
but we can plot some possible prices

872
00:38:08,762 --> 00:38:11,364
and actually do this revenue graph.

873
00:38:11,364 --> 00:38:14,086
And there, we've got it.

874
00:38:14,086 --> 00:38:16,528
We've now plotted what our revenue is

875
00:38:16,528 --> 00:38:20,250
and we've got our peak, our revenue, optimized price.

876
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,431
You've done it, now you've figured out your price.

877
00:38:23,655 --> 00:38:24,215
Or maybe not.

878
00:38:24,215 --> 00:38:27,136
Because I have one more question.

879
00:38:27,136 --> 00:38:29,616
Should you charge the revenue optimized price?

880
00:38:29,616 --> 00:38:34,178
This is not a question that I think gets asked enough

881
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:37,159
in monetization design.

882
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:38,439
This chart you're looking at,

883
00:38:38,439 --> 00:38:41,480
I'm going to dive into a little bit here.

884
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:46,781
It's a little bit more of a complex economics concept,

885
00:38:46,781 --> 00:38:47,401
but bear with me.

886
00:38:48,443 --> 00:38:51,647
So microtransactions all exist as monopolies.

887
00:38:51,647 --> 00:38:53,810
They all operate as monopolies.

888
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:56,674
If I don't like the price of the boosters for your game,

889
00:38:56,674 --> 00:38:59,798
I cannot go to another game and buy the boosters there.

890
00:38:59,798 --> 00:39:01,220
That's not available to me.

891
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,082
So we're all operating in monopolies.

892
00:39:03,583 --> 00:39:07,045
Monopolies push commodities to be more inelastic.

893
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:10,908
If we're actually being totally honest, all microtransactions are inelastic.

894
00:39:10,908 --> 00:39:16,412
We would never consider anything we sell to truly be elastic in an economic sense,

895
00:39:16,412 --> 00:39:18,713
like a pure economic sense, economic theory.

896
00:39:18,713 --> 00:39:23,676
Because we operate in a monopoly, so everything is inherently somewhat inelastic.

897
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:27,699
Without competition, purchasers are more likely

898
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:30,623
to continue buying something even when the price goes up,

899
00:39:30,623 --> 00:39:34,568
but that doesn't mean that they are happy to pay that price.

900
00:39:34,568 --> 00:39:37,431
The concept of socially optimal price

901
00:39:37,431 --> 00:39:40,895
comes from what's known as a necessary monopoly.

902
00:39:41,476 --> 00:39:45,261
which games are not, but I think it bears understanding.

903
00:39:45,261 --> 00:39:48,765
Necessary monopolies are monopolies that exist

904
00:39:48,765 --> 00:39:50,688
because competition is too inefficient

905
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:52,109
for the market to bear,

906
00:39:52,109 --> 00:39:54,152
but the thing they're producing is really important

907
00:39:54,152 --> 00:39:54,713
and we need it.

908
00:39:54,713 --> 00:39:56,876
So a really good example of this

909
00:39:56,876 --> 00:39:58,598
is the pharmaceuticals industry.

910
00:39:59,008 --> 00:40:04,170
So we actually don't have enough high-end biology researchers

911
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:07,591
and medical researchers to fund 12 or 15

912
00:40:07,591 --> 00:40:09,412
different pharmaceutical companies

913
00:40:09,412 --> 00:40:10,713
researching the same drug.

914
00:40:10,713 --> 00:40:11,513
It doesn't exist.

915
00:40:11,513 --> 00:40:13,934
It's too inefficient, and the market can't support it.

916
00:40:13,934 --> 00:40:15,855
But we need life-saving drugs.

917
00:40:15,855 --> 00:40:17,855
And so we have a necessary monopoly.

918
00:40:17,855 --> 00:40:20,156
And we allow that to happen.

919
00:40:20,156 --> 00:40:24,858
This chart is actually from policymaking

920
00:40:24,858 --> 00:40:26,699
around pharmaceuticals.

921
00:40:27,807 --> 00:40:34,631
And basically what we've got is if you produce a life-saving drug and you plotted the revenue

922
00:40:34,631 --> 00:40:39,774
optimized price for that drug, it is going to be very high because it is life-saving.

923
00:40:39,774 --> 00:40:44,416
And if people need it to live, they're going to be willing to pay whatever they can, which

924
00:40:44,416 --> 00:40:45,697
is going to be high.

925
00:40:45,697 --> 00:40:49,539
Now a lot of people won't be able to afford it, and so they'll die.

926
00:40:49,539 --> 00:40:52,481
And that is going to incur a social cost.

927
00:40:53,812 --> 00:40:57,055
And so when we see the socially optimal price,

928
00:40:57,055 --> 00:41:00,038
that's the price where we sell this life-saving drug

929
00:41:00,038 --> 00:41:02,701
for just enough money to cover the cost

930
00:41:02,701 --> 00:41:03,782
of creating the drug.

931
00:41:03,782 --> 00:41:05,503
That's the best for society

932
00:41:05,503 --> 00:41:07,726
because the least number of people die.

933
00:41:07,726 --> 00:41:09,948
I'm using the pharmaceutical example because...

934
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,822
Calculating this, calculating social cost,

935
00:41:12,822 --> 00:41:14,403
is really, really complicated.

936
00:41:14,403 --> 00:41:18,567
And unfortunately, one of the easiest ways to understand it

937
00:41:18,567 --> 00:41:20,509
is when we calculate death as the cost.

938
00:41:20,509 --> 00:41:23,492
That's actually a little more binary and cut and dry.

939
00:41:23,492 --> 00:41:26,615
There are other industries that this affects,

940
00:41:26,615 --> 00:41:28,296
like telecommunications and

941
00:41:29,554 --> 00:41:31,536
utilities providers that is not so dire.

942
00:41:31,536 --> 00:41:34,238
But it's really complicated to actually calculate social cost.

943
00:41:34,238 --> 00:41:37,361
Here it's a little bit easier to understand if we just say,

944
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:40,983
yeah, this is the point where the least people die.

945
00:41:40,983 --> 00:41:43,085
I'm not going to talk about the fair return price

946
00:41:43,085 --> 00:41:45,547
because I don't want this talk to get political.

947
00:41:45,547 --> 00:41:46,448
You can look into it.

948
00:41:48,028 --> 00:41:52,810
In video games, we're not talking about a social cost that's death, thank goodness,

949
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:57,053
but that doesn't mean social cost doesn't exist in your game.

950
00:41:57,053 --> 00:42:03,256
One of the biggest things that you need to think about when you are pricing something

951
00:42:03,636 --> 00:42:06,718
is can you calculate your social cost?

952
00:42:06,718 --> 00:42:08,100
You should be asking this question.

953
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,601
You should be thinking about it, even if you decide

954
00:42:09,601 --> 00:42:11,282
that you don't care about your social cost.

955
00:42:11,282 --> 00:42:13,404
You should at least be considering it.

956
00:42:13,404 --> 00:42:16,586
It's not as obvious and severe, this social cost,

957
00:42:16,586 --> 00:42:20,249
as it would be with life-saving drugs and all of that.

958
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:24,312
But sometimes players will pay the revenue-optimized price,

959
00:42:24,312 --> 00:42:26,554
but they will feel taken advantage of

960
00:42:26,554 --> 00:42:27,735
every time they pay it.

961
00:42:28,683 --> 00:42:31,306
It's really easy to say that if someone bought something,

962
00:42:31,306 --> 00:42:34,209
they must have thought that it was worth the price they paid,

963
00:42:34,209 --> 00:42:37,512
but in a monopoly, that's just not true.

964
00:42:37,512 --> 00:42:40,395
And charging prices that players perceive as too high

965
00:42:40,395 --> 00:42:42,317
can cause a perception problem,

966
00:42:42,317 --> 00:42:43,939
and it can cause community backlash,

967
00:42:43,939 --> 00:42:45,120
and it can build up over time.

968
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:51,023
If you take one thing away from this talk, it is that your games are not free markets,

969
00:42:51,023 --> 00:42:57,187
and if you are doing economic evaluation of your games and you use free market economics

970
00:42:57,187 --> 00:42:59,868
to do it, you're lying to yourself.

971
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,269
You're not getting accurate information.

972
00:43:01,269 --> 00:43:06,132
You need to be using monopoly economics, because that's the actual market that you exist in.

973
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:11,600
One example that I see of this in games a lot

974
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,943
is very high prices for things like name changes

975
00:43:14,943 --> 00:43:16,645
and server transfers.

976
00:43:16,645 --> 00:43:20,829
It is true that those are incredibly inelastic

977
00:43:20,829 --> 00:43:22,771
and people will pay a really high price for them

978
00:43:22,771 --> 00:43:25,193
because when they need them, they really need them.

979
00:43:25,193 --> 00:43:26,935
But they have a tendency to create a situation

980
00:43:26,935 --> 00:43:28,557
where the player feels taken advantage of.

981
00:43:28,837 --> 00:43:30,818
like their account or their player is being held hostage

982
00:43:30,818 --> 00:43:35,482
because they really feel like they need these things.

983
00:43:35,482 --> 00:43:38,685
It's not a mistake that when players are most likely

984
00:43:38,685 --> 00:43:41,307
to purchase a server transfer is also correlated

985
00:43:41,307 --> 00:43:43,428
with when they are most likely to leave your game forever

986
00:43:43,428 --> 00:43:45,710
because it's a really high-pressure situation.

987
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:48,653
So social costs can also,

988
00:43:48,653 --> 00:43:51,555
that's a pretty specific example,

989
00:43:51,555 --> 00:43:53,697
but social costs can kind of creep in

990
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:55,798
to your entire microtransaction catalog

991
00:43:55,798 --> 00:43:56,599
because

992
00:43:57,668 --> 00:43:59,349
players have different purchasing power.

993
00:43:59,349 --> 00:44:03,490
You gotta understand that players have spending limits.

994
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:05,911
At some point, no matter how high their demand is,

995
00:44:05,911 --> 00:44:07,532
they're gonna run out of disposable income.

996
00:44:07,532 --> 00:44:10,093
So if the only thing you think of is how enticing

997
00:44:10,093 --> 00:44:12,534
is this item, how much do people want this item,

998
00:44:12,534 --> 00:44:13,934
you're gonna end up cutting a lot of people off.

999
00:44:13,934 --> 00:44:15,855
Because when you price something

1000
00:44:15,855 --> 00:44:17,436
at the revenue-optimizing price,

1001
00:44:17,436 --> 00:44:18,736
you are cutting some people off.

1002
00:44:18,736 --> 00:44:20,677
That's sort of inevitable, especially like

1003
00:44:20,677 --> 00:44:21,518
in free-to-play titles.

1004
00:44:21,518 --> 00:44:23,178
Somebody's gonna be on the other side of that line

1005
00:44:23,178 --> 00:44:25,159
where they can't really afford the thing

1006
00:44:25,159 --> 00:44:26,720
that you're buying, that you're selling.

1007
00:44:28,551 --> 00:44:33,093
But you have to also account for the fact that when you price potential customers out

1008
00:44:33,093 --> 00:44:35,774
of an item, that incurs a social cost.

1009
00:44:35,774 --> 00:44:39,376
And if players continually run into a situation in which everything they want in your game

1010
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:43,918
is out of their reach because they can't afford it, they're probably going to become frustrated

1011
00:44:43,918 --> 00:44:50,462
and they'll probably leave because in a lot of games, the loop of purchasing things through

1012
00:44:50,462 --> 00:44:51,082
microtransactions...

1013
00:44:51,623 --> 00:44:53,325
is a core fundamental part of the game,

1014
00:44:53,325 --> 00:44:55,028
and players see it that way.

1015
00:44:55,028 --> 00:44:57,452
So if you are saying you can't participate in this,

1016
00:44:57,452 --> 00:45:01,339
you're never gonna be allowed into this part of the game,

1017
00:45:01,339 --> 00:45:04,083
players do see that as being cut off from things,

1018
00:45:04,083 --> 00:45:04,964
and they don't love it.

1019
00:45:06,093 --> 00:45:08,894
Further, if you attempt to squeeze players

1020
00:45:08,894 --> 00:45:11,115
right to their purchasing limit over and over and over again,

1021
00:45:11,115 --> 00:45:13,796
they're eventually going to feel taken advantage of.

1022
00:45:13,796 --> 00:45:15,517
You'll basically optimize revenue

1023
00:45:15,517 --> 00:45:17,678
on a series of individual items, but you'll

1024
00:45:17,678 --> 00:45:21,059
end up cutting your potential revenue pool significantly.

1025
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:22,640
You'll just leave off a big group of them,

1026
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,781
and you'll probably burn some of your players out.

1027
00:45:24,781 --> 00:45:27,002
Spending burnout's very real.

1028
00:45:27,002 --> 00:45:31,343
It has a very intense negative emotional effect.

1029
00:45:31,343 --> 00:45:34,145
And it also leads to a lot of people leaving games

1030
00:45:34,145 --> 00:45:35,505
and turning out permanently.

1031
00:45:36,201 --> 00:45:38,622
And this is kind of silly, right?

1032
00:45:38,622 --> 00:45:41,683
Because microtransactions have such a low

1033
00:45:41,683 --> 00:45:43,924
continued production cost, which like,

1034
00:45:43,924 --> 00:45:46,265
we don't even have to think of supply,

1035
00:45:46,265 --> 00:45:47,485
I don't even have to put it on charts

1036
00:45:47,485 --> 00:45:49,986
because it's so negligible to what we do.

1037
00:45:49,986 --> 00:45:52,827
We have incredible control over pacing

1038
00:45:52,827 --> 00:45:55,008
and variety of items offered and pricing

1039
00:45:55,008 --> 00:45:58,649
that like no one in physical goods can ever have.

1040
00:45:58,649 --> 00:46:00,670
So we can actually optimize for this.

1041
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:02,891
We can care about social costs too

1042
00:46:02,891 --> 00:46:04,632
and actually balance against that.

1043
00:46:04,912 --> 00:46:07,534
and hopefully have longer engagement with our players

1044
00:46:07,534 --> 00:46:10,276
and more potential customers with a wider spending pool.

1045
00:46:10,276 --> 00:46:16,502
When we launched Guild Wars 2, we thought about this a lot.

1046
00:46:16,502 --> 00:46:17,983
We were creating a premium game.

1047
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,744
When we launched Guild Wars 2, it cost $60

1048
00:46:19,744 --> 00:46:22,287
to get the game, to get in the door.

1049
00:46:22,287 --> 00:46:23,948
But we knew, we'd planned from the beginning

1050
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:25,209
that we were going to support the game

1051
00:46:25,209 --> 00:46:26,050
through microtransactions.

1052
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:28,332
We had a live business that we were preparing

1053
00:46:28,332 --> 00:46:30,874
and we had plans for right from the beginning.

1054
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:34,799
But then again, like I said, $60 to get in the door.

1055
00:46:34,799 --> 00:46:36,441
Everyone who was coming into the game

1056
00:46:36,441 --> 00:46:37,662
had just paid us $60.

1057
00:46:37,662 --> 00:46:40,966
And we were creating our first catalog,

1058
00:46:40,966 --> 00:46:44,690
the very first thing we showed players in our cash shop.

1059
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:47,153
We were constantly asking, how will this store

1060
00:46:47,153 --> 00:46:48,755
look to someone who just paid us $60?

1061
00:46:48,755 --> 00:46:50,737
They just got in on $60.

1062
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:57,641
We needed to be aware how these items' values were going to be compared to that initial

1063
00:46:57,641 --> 00:46:57,862
$60 cost.

1064
00:46:57,862 --> 00:47:02,724
Even if maybe in a vacuum we would have done some things differently, we had to be aware

1065
00:47:02,724 --> 00:47:05,945
of this sort of community and social situation in the game.

1066
00:47:06,688 --> 00:47:10,570
So we wanted the game to feel accessible and sustainable

1067
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:12,851
to those players even though they just paid a premium price

1068
00:47:12,851 --> 00:47:15,732
and we are essentially saying you're signing up for a game

1069
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:18,054
in which there's gonna be a live business.

1070
00:47:18,054 --> 00:47:19,874
That's the way that we're gonna support it.

1071
00:47:19,874 --> 00:47:22,276
So this is gonna be a part of that business

1072
00:47:22,276 --> 00:47:23,836
and a part of your gaming experience.

1073
00:47:24,893 --> 00:47:27,514
So we focused on having a lot of high value,

1074
00:47:27,514 --> 00:47:32,035
permanent unlocks, to set a standard of high value

1075
00:47:32,035 --> 00:47:34,996
and high quality, because that we felt paired better

1076
00:47:34,996 --> 00:47:36,917
with the fact that they just paid $60 to us

1077
00:47:36,917 --> 00:47:39,357
and they were interested in a premium experience

1078
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:41,598
and they were interested in things that were gonna last

1079
00:47:41,598 --> 00:47:44,179
the lifetime of their account.

1080
00:47:45,113 --> 00:47:48,254
But we also put a big variety of low cost consumables

1081
00:47:48,254 --> 00:47:50,855
into the game because we wanted to make sure players

1082
00:47:50,855 --> 00:47:54,156
were primed for the fact that there was going to be

1083
00:47:54,156 --> 00:47:56,396
a lot of accessibility to the cash shop

1084
00:47:56,396 --> 00:47:57,856
and there was gonna be a lot of options

1085
00:47:57,856 --> 00:47:59,397
for all of our players.

1086
00:47:59,397 --> 00:48:01,217
And we also have a dual currency system

1087
00:48:01,217 --> 00:48:04,578
that's freely tradable so players can actually trade

1088
00:48:04,578 --> 00:48:08,199
their, our virtual currency for the in-game currency

1089
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:10,159
at a floating rate that's determined by demand.

1090
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:12,580
So for us, also very important to say,

1091
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:14,200
hey, even if you're not gonna be buying

1092
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:14,900
our virtual currency.

1093
00:48:15,381 --> 00:48:18,323
you can be trading your gold in for that virtual currency

1094
00:48:18,323 --> 00:48:19,884
and still use this system.

1095
00:48:19,884 --> 00:48:22,486
There's gonna be something cheap enough

1096
00:48:22,486 --> 00:48:23,067
to make that realistic for you.

1097
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:28,471
Okay, so just a few more things about pricing

1098
00:48:28,471 --> 00:48:29,832
before we move on.

1099
00:48:29,832 --> 00:48:32,034
The price you set for your items

1100
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,676
needs to reflect the value.

1101
00:48:33,676 --> 00:48:35,237
We sort of talked a lot about that,

1102
00:48:35,237 --> 00:48:38,019
about what value is and how to determine it.

1103
00:48:38,019 --> 00:48:39,740
But it also, the price you set,

1104
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:42,383
has a large impact on the player's perception

1105
00:48:42,383 --> 00:48:44,024
of an item's value.

1106
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:47,107
And first impressions are really important.

1107
00:48:47,107 --> 00:48:49,128
Human beings have this thing with numbers,

1108
00:48:49,128 --> 00:48:52,171
they're sort of special in our brains.

1109
00:48:52,171 --> 00:48:54,132
When we attach a number to something,

1110
00:48:54,132 --> 00:48:56,634
it's really hard to dislodge, it's harder than an image,

1111
00:48:56,634 --> 00:48:58,596
it's harder than a sound.

1112
00:48:58,596 --> 00:49:00,898
I guess it's not as hard as smell for some weird reason,

1113
00:49:00,898 --> 00:49:02,660
that's like the most difficult one.

1114
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:03,720
But numbers are really sticky.

1115
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:06,062
And once we associate them with something,

1116
00:49:06,062 --> 00:49:07,904
it's really hard to change it.

1117
00:49:07,904 --> 00:49:10,506
So once you put an item out there with a price,

1118
00:49:10,506 --> 00:49:12,448
you're kind of stuck with the perception of that price,

1119
00:49:12,448 --> 00:49:13,328
even if you change it later.

1120
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,749
I think this probably goes that same,

1121
00:49:15,749 --> 00:49:18,110
but you should never raise prices on items.

1122
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:22,492
That's obviously not gonna go over really well.

1123
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:27,654
Discounts go over better than raising prices, of course,

1124
00:49:27,654 --> 00:49:30,915
but it's very hard to permanently change that association.

1125
00:49:30,915 --> 00:49:35,116
So even if you eventually lower the price of an item,

1126
00:49:35,116 --> 00:49:36,677
it's never gonna have the effect

1127
00:49:36,677 --> 00:49:38,518
that it would have if you launched with that price.

1128
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:39,798
You're still gonna be sort of fighting

1129
00:49:39,798 --> 00:49:41,739
against that initial perception.

1130
00:49:44,628 --> 00:49:49,150
For similar reasons, frequent price fluctuations are not great.

1131
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:55,253
I even mean running frequent sales events can be significantly detrimental

1132
00:49:55,253 --> 00:49:59,215
to the way players interact with your store.

1133
00:49:59,215 --> 00:50:01,856
It erodes players' confidence when they're purchasing.

1134
00:50:02,176 --> 00:50:03,898
So if prices are constantly changing,

1135
00:50:03,898 --> 00:50:06,241
you're introducing a new question the player has to answer,

1136
00:50:06,241 --> 00:50:08,925
which is, is this the right moment for me to buy this?

1137
00:50:08,925 --> 00:50:09,866
Should I wait an hour?

1138
00:50:09,866 --> 00:50:10,767
Should I wait a day?

1139
00:50:10,767 --> 00:50:11,868
Should I wait a week?

1140
00:50:11,868 --> 00:50:13,931
I don't know because the price is always changing.

1141
00:50:13,931 --> 00:50:15,773
And that's an additional question

1142
00:50:15,773 --> 00:50:17,195
you don't really want them to have, right?

1143
00:50:17,195 --> 00:50:19,718
You want them to be the easiest possible decision

1144
00:50:19,718 --> 00:50:21,000
they make to make that purchase.

1145
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:24,111
The last thing we're gonna talk about with pricing

1146
00:50:24,111 --> 00:50:26,312
is indirect pricing, mostly just talked about

1147
00:50:26,312 --> 00:50:29,773
putting prices on items, but there's also

1148
00:50:29,773 --> 00:50:33,414
a very common practice in microtransaction design

1149
00:50:33,414 --> 00:50:36,175
to do indirect pricing, so we're gonna go back

1150
00:50:36,175 --> 00:50:37,456
to talking about random boxes.

1151
00:50:37,456 --> 00:50:39,736
I talked a little earlier about them,

1152
00:50:39,736 --> 00:50:42,537
we talked about jackpots and we talked about grab bags.

1153
00:50:42,537 --> 00:50:45,759
They both are also indirect purchasing systems,

1154
00:50:45,759 --> 00:50:48,300
but they do it a little bit differently.

1155
00:50:49,238 --> 00:50:52,820
So jackpots are usually built around the idea of items

1156
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:54,401
that derive their value from rarity.

1157
00:50:54,401 --> 00:50:56,762
Of course, this requires, as I said,

1158
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,803
your game to have an actual concept of rarity

1159
00:50:58,803 --> 00:51:01,444
and for your game to actually put value on rarity.

1160
00:51:01,444 --> 00:51:06,227
But let's assume that it does and you have jackpots.

1161
00:51:06,227 --> 00:51:07,747
But if it doesn't, you're probably not gonna do

1162
00:51:07,747 --> 00:51:08,808
super great with jackpot items.

1163
00:51:08,808 --> 00:51:13,230
Jackpot random boxes basically allow you to price an item

1164
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:15,551
by calculating the amount of money a player will spend

1165
00:51:15,551 --> 00:51:16,691
in order to get the jackpot.

1166
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:20,948
You don't want to fall into the trap of trying to calculate the price by determining how

1167
00:51:20,948 --> 00:51:23,750
many of the item you wish to exist in the world.

1168
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:24,971
That just isn't going to translate.

1169
00:51:24,971 --> 00:51:26,232
We talked about it a little before.

1170
00:51:26,232 --> 00:51:27,513
Players just don't care.

1171
00:51:27,513 --> 00:51:29,634
They only care about their personal experience.

1172
00:51:29,634 --> 00:51:33,737
You want to anchor this as much as you can to if I am an individual player buying this

1173
00:51:33,737 --> 00:51:35,778
thing, how am I going to feel about its value?

1174
00:51:35,778 --> 00:51:36,159
Also, hey...

1175
00:51:38,955 --> 00:51:41,837
watch out for random number generators.

1176
00:51:41,837 --> 00:51:45,500
I know they're really simple and they're like now,

1177
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:49,503
they're just everywhere and you can just grab them

1178
00:51:49,503 --> 00:51:50,343
basically for free.

1179
00:51:50,343 --> 00:51:52,024
So people use them all the time,

1180
00:51:52,024 --> 00:51:54,246
but if you have an item that comes out

1181
00:51:54,246 --> 00:51:55,707
at a one in 50 drop rate, that means 36% of your players

1182
00:51:55,707 --> 00:51:57,168
aren't gonna get it in 50 drops.

1183
00:51:57,168 --> 00:51:59,169
It's gonna be more than 50.

1184
00:51:59,169 --> 00:52:00,951
Yes, 36% of them are gonna get it in less.

1185
00:52:01,511 --> 00:52:06,313
than 50 as well, but that's not gonna really placate

1186
00:52:06,313 --> 00:52:09,355
the ones that had to pay more than that.

1187
00:52:09,355 --> 00:52:12,136
Random number generators are not the only way to go.

1188
00:52:12,136 --> 00:52:14,797
I would implore you to think about other things

1189
00:52:14,797 --> 00:52:18,299
like set schedules, token systems,

1190
00:52:18,299 --> 00:52:20,620
anything that you can do to gain a little bit more control

1191
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:23,201
as a designer over crafting the experience for your players

1192
00:52:23,201 --> 00:52:25,002
so that you can have more control

1193
00:52:25,002 --> 00:52:26,663
over their perception of value.

1194
00:52:26,663 --> 00:52:28,724
Random number generators, sometimes they're totally fine,

1195
00:52:28,724 --> 00:52:29,724
but you know.

1196
00:52:30,317 --> 00:52:33,538
humans are really bad with actual random.

1197
00:52:33,538 --> 00:52:34,918
Okay, so grab bags.

1198
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:37,119
They're not built around rarity markets,

1199
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:39,979
so that's not the way that they use,

1200
00:52:39,979 --> 00:52:41,940
they create indirect pricing.

1201
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:44,081
Grab bag actually function the best

1202
00:52:44,081 --> 00:52:48,222
when the items come out of them at about the same rate.

1203
00:52:48,222 --> 00:52:49,682
So even though that's true,

1204
00:52:49,682 --> 00:52:53,483
they still are an indirect pricing model.

1205
00:52:53,483 --> 00:52:54,824
Let's use an example.

1206
00:52:54,824 --> 00:52:57,565
So let's say you've created a cosmetic item,

1207
00:52:57,565 --> 00:52:59,385
and for instance, it's a monocle.

1208
00:53:00,473 --> 00:53:02,715
And then let's say you plotted your demand curve

1209
00:53:02,715 --> 00:53:05,016
for that monocle and you looked at your ARPPU

1210
00:53:05,016 --> 00:53:07,637
and you looked at your potential market

1211
00:53:07,637 --> 00:53:08,958
and you did all of this research

1212
00:53:08,958 --> 00:53:11,119
and you found that the monocle was really niche

1213
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:13,521
and really inelastic and the optimal price

1214
00:53:13,521 --> 00:53:16,122
for the monocle was $80.

1215
00:53:16,122 --> 00:53:17,403
You'd probably look at that and think,

1216
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:19,164
man, that's a lot of money for a monocle.

1217
00:53:19,164 --> 00:53:21,565
That's way out of whack with what most people would pay

1218
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:23,266
for cosmetics and other games.

1219
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:25,427
That might not look so good in our catalog

1220
00:53:25,427 --> 00:53:27,988
if we actually charged $80 for this monocle.

1221
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:32,329
A possible solution for this problem is to release the monocle in a crab bag.

1222
00:53:33,156 --> 00:53:35,958
Because you did all this work to plot the demand curve

1223
00:53:35,958 --> 00:53:38,039
for the monocle, but there's a second demand curve

1224
00:53:38,039 --> 00:53:41,061
that exists for players that just want cosmetic options.

1225
00:53:41,061 --> 00:53:42,822
And they'd be happy to have the monocle,

1226
00:53:42,822 --> 00:53:44,603
but they're not gonna pay a premium price for the monocle.

1227
00:53:44,603 --> 00:53:46,344
So you can put the monocle in a grab bag

1228
00:53:46,344 --> 00:53:48,086
with a lot of other cosmetic options,

1229
00:53:48,086 --> 00:53:51,328
you're not gonna be able to charge anywhere near $80 for it,

1230
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:53,549
but your market's gonna be so much bigger

1231
00:53:53,549 --> 00:53:56,071
that you'll probably actually do better in the long run.

1232
00:53:56,071 --> 00:53:57,852
Games like Overwatch basically employ

1233
00:53:57,852 --> 00:53:59,893
this strategy exclusively, and it actually has

1234
00:53:59,893 --> 00:54:02,035
pretty high customer satisfaction overall.

1235
00:54:03,595 --> 00:54:04,937
Okay, we're finally through pricing.

1236
00:54:04,937 --> 00:54:08,423
Let's talk a little bit about feedback and data.

1237
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:12,559
So feedback is really, really important to design.

1238
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,162
We are all full of cognitive biases

1239
00:54:16,162 --> 00:54:19,624
and skewed perspectives and personal heuristics,

1240
00:54:19,624 --> 00:54:22,987
and we rely on other people to give us feedback

1241
00:54:22,987 --> 00:54:25,548
and provide a diverse set of voices

1242
00:54:25,548 --> 00:54:27,670
so that we can understand how to do good design

1243
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:29,071
that isn't just for us,

1244
00:54:29,071 --> 00:54:31,112
but is actually maybe going to be broadly appealing.

1245
00:54:31,112 --> 00:54:33,754
But what do you do when you're designing something

1246
00:54:33,754 --> 00:54:35,535
that is almost impossible for people

1247
00:54:35,535 --> 00:54:37,196
to speak openly and honestly about?

1248
00:54:37,937 --> 00:54:39,440
Well, traditionally for microtransactions,

1249
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,883
the answer is you turn to data.

1250
00:54:40,883 --> 00:54:41,405
And data is great.

1251
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:44,440
I love data.

1252
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:47,881
The collection of data on a large scale

1253
00:54:47,881 --> 00:54:50,342
has changed the video game industry, right?

1254
00:54:50,342 --> 00:54:52,622
We have amazing insights into the activities

1255
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,943
of our players now, and it's really, really incredible.

1256
00:54:55,943 --> 00:54:57,683
But data has a really big weakness

1257
00:54:57,683 --> 00:54:59,203
when it comes to making design decisions,

1258
00:54:59,203 --> 00:55:03,304
and that's that data is analytical, but it's not predictive.

1259
00:55:03,304 --> 00:55:06,685
Data can be used to make predictions,

1260
00:55:06,685 --> 00:55:08,605
but all by itself, it isn't predictive.

1261
00:55:09,982 --> 00:55:12,065
And that sucks, because we really need it

1262
00:55:12,065 --> 00:55:13,447
to make predictions.

1263
00:55:13,447 --> 00:55:16,732
We need to understand how players are gonna react

1264
00:55:16,732 --> 00:55:19,176
to our designs, what should we focus our efforts on next.

1265
00:55:19,176 --> 00:55:21,439
We need all these predictions, and we need them really fast.

1266
00:55:22,316 --> 00:55:24,677
Forecasting and actual predictive analysis

1267
00:55:24,677 --> 00:55:26,497
is really time consuming and involves people

1268
00:55:26,497 --> 00:55:28,418
with like PhDs and stuff and it's really hard.

1269
00:55:28,418 --> 00:55:29,558
And it's complex.

1270
00:55:29,558 --> 00:55:32,259
And it's a really bad substitute for feedback

1271
00:55:32,259 --> 00:55:33,759
because it's so slow.

1272
00:55:33,759 --> 00:55:37,780
Data is fast and now it's really easily obtainable.

1273
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:40,321
So what I see happen for a lot of developers

1274
00:55:40,321 --> 00:55:43,022
is they decide that since they need data to be predictive,

1275
00:55:43,022 --> 00:55:43,522
then it just is.

1276
00:55:43,522 --> 00:55:43,942
So, you know, we.

1277
00:55:49,469 --> 00:55:49,669
Why not?

1278
00:55:49,669 --> 00:55:53,092
It's the magic of design.

1279
00:55:53,092 --> 00:55:55,354
You create items and features and changes

1280
00:55:55,354 --> 00:55:58,356
and then you look at data and you react to the data.

1281
00:55:58,356 --> 00:56:01,999
And that strategy is sort of effective.

1282
00:56:01,999 --> 00:56:04,921
Data sometimes does line up with predictive analysis

1283
00:56:04,921 --> 00:56:06,423
and so you're gonna get some hits.

1284
00:56:06,423 --> 00:56:07,604
And the nice thing about this strategy

1285
00:56:07,604 --> 00:56:10,066
is that it moves really fast and creates a lot of iterations

1286
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:12,187
so it covers up all its misses.

1287
00:56:12,187 --> 00:56:13,608
So it just rolls right over them

1288
00:56:13,608 --> 00:56:14,549
and you never find out about it.

1289
00:56:16,836 --> 00:56:19,617
But from a design perspective, this is super, super dangerous

1290
00:56:19,617 --> 00:56:20,797
even though it creates a lot of work,

1291
00:56:20,797 --> 00:56:22,097
and sometimes that's very satisfying.

1292
00:56:22,097 --> 00:56:24,298
A vast majority of outcomes play out

1293
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:26,278
over a long period of time, right?

1294
00:56:26,278 --> 00:56:29,839
And this strategy guarantees that only a really small subset

1295
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:32,880
of possible design decisions are ever gonna get made

1296
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,481
because they are the design decisions

1297
00:56:34,481 --> 00:56:37,181
that will produce positive data in the short term,

1298
00:56:37,181 --> 00:56:39,962
and your designers will definitely start optimizing for that

1299
00:56:39,962 --> 00:56:42,023
because they're designers and they do that all the time.

1300
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:43,723
They game every system they can,

1301
00:56:43,723 --> 00:56:45,223
even if they don't realize they're doing it.

1302
00:56:45,764 --> 00:56:50,188
This is basically the equivalent of all your design decisions coming from brainstorming alone.

1303
00:56:50,188 --> 00:56:55,192
Only ideas that can be thought of, explained, and defended in a single sentence are ever going to survive.

1304
00:56:55,192 --> 00:56:56,033
And that's not great.

1305
00:56:57,061 --> 00:56:59,983
It shouldn't be shocking that short-term gain

1306
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:01,964
is often paid for with long-term loss.

1307
00:57:01,964 --> 00:57:04,206
If your relationship with your players

1308
00:57:04,206 --> 00:57:05,947
lasts longer than a single data cycle,

1309
00:57:05,947 --> 00:57:08,809
then making design decisions based on a single data cycle

1310
00:57:08,809 --> 00:57:10,511
is ludicrous.

1311
00:57:10,511 --> 00:57:12,292
It's just not good enough,

1312
00:57:12,292 --> 00:57:13,733
and you're not gonna really gain any insight

1313
00:57:13,733 --> 00:57:15,915
into why players are doing anything.

1314
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:20,657
You know, this is all one item from Guild Wars 2.

1315
00:57:20,657 --> 00:57:23,198
It's just looking at it from different perspectives,

1316
00:57:23,198 --> 00:57:25,860
hourly sales, daily sales, weekly sales.

1317
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:27,400
They all tell a different story.

1318
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,101
And I mean, just from this information,

1319
00:57:29,101 --> 00:57:31,723
I couldn't even tell you if this item was successful.

1320
00:57:31,723 --> 00:57:33,343
It sort of depends on what you meant to do with it.

1321
00:57:35,343 --> 00:57:38,265
A good example of this is for the upsell example.

1322
00:57:38,265 --> 00:57:41,648
You might decide that when it would be most advantageous

1323
00:57:41,648 --> 00:57:42,689
for a player to buy something,

1324
00:57:42,689 --> 00:57:44,490
we're just gonna pop a message up and remind them

1325
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:46,372
that hey, they could buy it and it'd be really easy.

1326
00:57:46,372 --> 00:57:49,234
Just click this button right now and purchase it.

1327
00:57:49,234 --> 00:57:50,535
And usually that's gonna produce

1328
00:57:50,535 --> 00:57:52,136
this really big spike in sales,

1329
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:55,099
but then that spike is sort of destined to fail

1330
00:57:55,099 --> 00:57:57,321
and go down, it almost certainly will go down

1331
00:57:57,321 --> 00:58:00,023
below your sales before you did this.

1332
00:58:01,094 --> 00:58:06,236
And that's because people do respond to immediate attention-seeking calls to action, but they

1333
00:58:06,236 --> 00:58:08,276
can't keep responding to them.

1334
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:10,197
Our brains are set up to filter that out.

1335
00:58:10,197 --> 00:58:13,538
The reason we respond to them is because they seem like danger.

1336
00:58:13,538 --> 00:58:16,999
And after we realize, oh, this isn't dangerous and I know what it is, we just start tuning

1337
00:58:16,999 --> 00:58:17,299
it out.

1338
00:58:17,299 --> 00:58:18,839
And we can't really stop that.

1339
00:58:18,839 --> 00:58:21,100
We're hard-wired for it.

1340
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:25,721
So at this point, you're tying the item's success entirely to the ability.

1341
00:58:26,142 --> 00:58:28,907
for this attention-seeking call to action to work,

1342
00:58:28,907 --> 00:58:31,371
and it's destined to get less and less effective over time.

1343
00:58:33,063 --> 00:58:36,446
This is exactly the same kind of short-sighted number chasing

1344
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:38,928
that leads games to fall into an endless cycle of sales events.

1345
00:58:38,928 --> 00:58:41,951
Hey, we need to meet our goals this week.

1346
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:42,731
Let's have a sale.

1347
00:58:42,731 --> 00:58:44,493
Great, we pumped up the numbers.

1348
00:58:44,493 --> 00:58:46,054
Oh, but now we're doing really poorly

1349
00:58:46,054 --> 00:58:46,815
at the beginning of next week.

1350
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:47,736
Let's have another sale.

1351
00:58:47,736 --> 00:58:50,418
Let's do it again and again and again and again.

1352
00:58:50,418 --> 00:58:52,580
This slowly eats away at your average revenue

1353
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:53,201
per paying user.

1354
00:58:53,201 --> 00:58:53,721
It has to.

1355
00:58:53,721 --> 00:58:57,024
Just the math means that you are basically

1356
00:58:57,024 --> 00:58:59,186
lowering the price of all your items over time,

1357
00:58:59,186 --> 00:59:00,247
and you really can't stop that.

1358
00:59:00,967 --> 00:59:02,928
and looking at the big picture can possibly

1359
00:59:02,928 --> 00:59:04,688
get you out of this cycle.

1360
00:59:04,688 --> 00:59:07,548
So how do you avoid this sort of short-term data

1361
00:59:07,548 --> 00:59:10,429
being used as a substitute for feedback?

1362
00:59:10,429 --> 00:59:12,969
Well, you can try to get the data to kind of work for you,

1363
00:59:12,969 --> 00:59:16,570
right, set proactive goals that are relevant to design.

1364
00:59:16,570 --> 00:59:19,751
I said, know what you want to be looking for.

1365
00:59:19,751 --> 00:59:21,891
Maybe you're not looking for just raw sales numbers.

1366
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:23,551
Maybe you want to actually be looking at ARPPU.

1367
00:59:23,551 --> 00:59:26,252
Maybe you want to be looking at repeat purchasers.

1368
00:59:26,252 --> 00:59:28,632
Actually decide what you want to be looking at

1369
00:59:28,632 --> 00:59:30,433
before you actually put the item out there.

1370
00:59:32,089 --> 00:59:33,910
Another way to avoid data replacing feedback

1371
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:34,790
is to get the feedback.

1372
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:37,832
You know, I said earlier that people aren't really capable

1373
00:59:37,832 --> 00:59:39,613
of talking about microtransactions honestly,

1374
00:59:39,613 --> 00:59:41,233
and that's pretty true.

1375
00:59:41,233 --> 00:59:43,254
It's a really difficult conversation to discuss

1376
00:59:43,254 --> 00:59:48,277
because basically it's a highly emotional conversation

1377
00:59:48,277 --> 00:59:50,038
because it involves money.

1378
00:59:50,038 --> 00:59:51,479
And that makes sense, actually,

1379
00:59:51,479 --> 00:59:53,200
because game designers are super scary.

1380
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,381
Game designers spend a lot of time

1381
00:59:55,381 --> 00:59:57,102
learning how to manipulate human nature.

1382
00:59:57,522 --> 00:59:59,063
and encourage specific behavior.

1383
00:59:59,063 --> 01:00:02,166
So we actually have a really high capacity for doing evil,

1384
01:00:02,166 --> 01:00:03,387
and when you add money to the mix,

1385
01:00:03,387 --> 01:00:05,609
like the stakes are really high,

1386
01:00:05,609 --> 01:00:06,830
and it gets kind of frightening.

1387
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:08,452
And in fact, like if unchecked,

1388
01:00:08,452 --> 01:00:10,354
it can be easy to just start chasing numbers

1389
01:00:10,354 --> 01:00:12,335
and forget like, wait, what am I doing?

1390
01:00:12,335 --> 01:00:15,218
Like I'm manipulating people into doing, you know,

1391
01:00:15,218 --> 01:00:16,679
maybe something that they'll regret

1392
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:18,661
or something that they won't like.

1393
01:00:18,661 --> 01:00:20,523
And you have to actually watch out for that.

1394
01:00:20,523 --> 01:00:21,524
You need to check yourself from time to time.

1395
01:00:21,864 --> 01:00:24,525
Are your designs pushing or manipulating people

1396
01:00:24,525 --> 01:00:27,466
to do things they regret or that make them unhappy?

1397
01:00:27,466 --> 01:00:29,286
Your job is to entertain people and make fun,

1398
01:00:29,286 --> 01:00:31,827
even as a microtransaction designer,

1399
01:00:31,827 --> 01:00:33,288
and no one needs to play your game to live,

1400
01:00:33,288 --> 01:00:34,608
we talked about that.

1401
01:00:34,608 --> 01:00:37,529
So if you're creating situations that make players unhappy,

1402
01:00:37,529 --> 01:00:40,010
they're going to leave, and preventing that from happening

1403
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:42,490
is part of your job as a microtransaction designer,

1404
01:00:42,490 --> 01:00:44,671
not just selling the items, but also making sure

1405
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:46,251
you're not eroding the quality of your game.

1406
01:00:47,422 --> 01:00:48,624
I know, we're out of time basically.

1407
01:00:48,624 --> 01:00:49,707
I'm gonna try to get through this.

1408
01:00:49,707 --> 01:00:50,910
Feel free to stay if you want.

1409
01:00:50,910 --> 01:00:53,977
I have like maybe 10 more slides, but we are at 4.30.

1410
01:00:53,977 --> 01:00:54,719
So I apologize.

1411
01:00:56,142 --> 01:00:59,304
So the majority of unstructured microtransaction feedback

1412
01:00:59,304 --> 01:01:02,026
just comes down to, I don't want to have to pay for things,

1413
01:01:02,026 --> 01:01:03,567
and I'm pretty sympathetic to that

1414
01:01:03,567 --> 01:01:06,008
because capitalism is inherently unfair.

1415
01:01:06,008 --> 01:01:07,869
But engaging with that feedback

1416
01:01:07,869 --> 01:01:09,851
isn't really going to help you do better design.

1417
01:01:09,851 --> 01:01:13,453
So when you're soliciting feedback on microtransactions,

1418
01:01:13,453 --> 01:01:15,274
you need to focus the feedback

1419
01:01:15,274 --> 01:01:17,256
on things that are relevant to design.

1420
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:20,838
And open-ended questions like, would you buy this,

1421
01:01:20,838 --> 01:01:22,199
are not going to give you what you want.

1422
01:01:22,399 --> 01:01:25,983
because they make people feel pressured to answer in a way that makes them feel virtuous

1423
01:01:25,983 --> 01:01:30,186
or clever because it's a performative experience to be asked that kind of question.

1424
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:34,571
It doesn't really have, you're not going to get a lot of relevant information that way.

1425
01:01:35,079 --> 01:01:40,723
Instead, you want to focus on asking questions like, how would you use this item?

1426
01:01:40,723 --> 01:01:42,984
Or rank these items in order of value to you.

1427
01:01:42,984 --> 01:01:47,568
Things that are more quantitative than qualitative.

1428
01:01:47,568 --> 01:01:50,850
Or better yet, don't ask questions, just watch people use your item.

1429
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:56,694
That's the gold standard for feedback and all design, it's totally true for microtransactions,

1430
01:01:56,694 --> 01:02:01,458
you can learn a lot by looking at someone's eyes as they use your item and watching the

1431
01:02:01,458 --> 01:02:02,018
way they react.

1432
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:02,158
Okay.

1433
01:02:02,158 --> 01:02:02,578
And that's it.

1434
01:02:02,578 --> 01:02:02,739
Okay.

1435
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:06,903
We are in the homestretch, microtransactions and design.

1436
01:02:06,903 --> 01:02:11,028
This is just my little soapbox to end this.

1437
01:02:11,028 --> 01:02:14,231
I strongly believe that the mechanisms

1438
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:15,633
by which your game generates money

1439
01:02:15,633 --> 01:02:18,096
should be the purview of game designers.

1440
01:02:18,096 --> 01:02:20,298
Game designers should have the same vision, control,

1441
01:02:20,298 --> 01:02:21,800
and implementation responsibilities

1442
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,242
when it comes to microtransactions

1443
01:02:23,242 --> 01:02:25,164
as they do with any other system in your video game.

1444
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:29,991
Furthermore, game designers should enthusiastically

1445
01:02:29,991 --> 01:02:31,712
participate in the vision, control,

1446
01:02:31,712 --> 01:02:33,552
and implementation of microtransactions

1447
01:02:33,552 --> 01:02:36,193
because they matter a great deal to your game

1448
01:02:36,193 --> 01:02:38,253
and they matter a great deal to your players.

1449
01:02:38,253 --> 01:02:40,414
If your attitude around microtransactions

1450
01:02:40,414 --> 01:02:42,334
is I don't wanna have to think about that

1451
01:02:42,334 --> 01:02:44,274
or I personally don't like microtransactions,

1452
01:02:44,274 --> 01:02:47,075
I'd never buy one of those, so I'm not gonna do this,

1453
01:02:47,075 --> 01:02:48,935
you're doing yourself a huge disservice

1454
01:02:48,935 --> 01:02:50,676
and you're really doing your players a disservice.

1455
01:02:51,719 --> 01:02:54,521
Game designers are uniquely equipped to understand

1456
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:57,764
what players will value and how that value should be presented

1457
01:02:57,764 --> 01:03:00,346
in the most effective way.

1458
01:03:00,346 --> 01:03:03,049
As microtransactions become more and more a part

1459
01:03:03,049 --> 01:03:06,472
of all types of video games, game designers of all kinds

1460
01:03:06,472 --> 01:03:08,233
are going to have to get comfortable designing

1461
01:03:08,233 --> 01:03:10,615
microtransactions and being part of the discussion

1462
01:03:10,615 --> 01:03:12,297
about microtransaction strategy.

1463
01:03:12,297 --> 01:03:15,780
So if you're a game designer, I'm employing you.

1464
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:16,500
Get involved.

1465
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,242
You don't have to have a business background.

1466
01:03:18,482 --> 01:03:20,623
You just have to do the things you do.

1467
01:03:20,623 --> 01:03:22,364
You're uniquely equipped.

1468
01:03:22,364 --> 01:03:23,545
Get involved.

1469
01:03:23,545 --> 01:03:26,226
Demand that high quality standards

1470
01:03:26,226 --> 01:03:28,908
are placed on microtransaction design.

1471
01:03:28,908 --> 01:03:32,049
Stand up and confidently declare you are the right person

1472
01:03:32,049 --> 01:03:33,930
to make sure that those quality bars are met,

1473
01:03:33,930 --> 01:03:34,711
and then do it.

1474
01:03:34,711 --> 01:03:38,933
Deliver really great design with microtransactions.

1475
01:03:38,933 --> 01:03:40,293
Thank you very much.
