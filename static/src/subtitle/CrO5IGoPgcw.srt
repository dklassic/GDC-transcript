1
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:07,581
So, hello everyone and welcome.

2
00:00:29,046 --> 00:00:33,287
I have a friend who's an artist and has sometimes taken a view which I...

3
00:00:34,324 --> 00:00:37,086
agree with very well. You hold up a flower and say,

4
00:00:37,506 --> 00:00:41,789
look how beautiful it is. And I'll agree, I think. And he says, you see, as I as an

5
00:00:41,869 --> 00:00:45,712
artist can see how beautiful this is. But you as a scientist, oh take this all

6
00:00:45,772 --> 00:00:50,515
apart and it becomes dull thing. And I think that he's kind of nutty.

7
00:00:51,296 --> 00:00:55,719
First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too.

8
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:58,781
I believe, although I may not be quite as refined as

9
00:00:58,821 --> 00:01:02,944
aesthetically as he is, then I can appreciate the beauty of the flower.

10
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,501
At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees.

11
00:01:08,122 --> 00:01:12,145
I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty.

12
00:01:12,165 --> 00:01:18,230
I mean, it's not just beauty at this dimension of one centimeter, there's also beauty at a smaller dimension.

13
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:21,533
The inner structure, also the processes.

14
00:01:22,114 --> 00:01:29,260
The fact that the colors and the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it.

15
00:01:30,373 --> 00:01:35,576
is interesting. It means that insects can see the color. It adds a question. Does this

16
00:01:35,656 --> 00:01:42,440
aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? All kinds of interesting

17
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:50,025
questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery, and the

18
00:01:50,225 --> 00:01:53,988
awe of a flower. It only adds. I don't understand how it subtracts.

19
00:01:59,117 --> 00:02:03,360
If you expected science to give all the answers to the wonderful questions about what we are,

20
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,521
where we're going, what the meaning of the universe is and so on,

21
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:11,824
then I think you could easily become disillusioned and then look for some mystic answer to these

22
00:02:11,884 --> 00:02:16,607
problems. How a scientist can take a mystic answer, I don't know, because the whole spirit

23
00:02:17,427 --> 00:02:21,069
is to understand... Well, never mind that. I don't understand that. But anyhow...

24
00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:29,524
If you think of it, the way I think of what we're doing is we're exploring, we're trying to find out as much as we can about the world.

25
00:02:30,264 --> 00:02:33,907
People say to me, are you looking for the ultimate laws of physics?

26
00:02:33,927 --> 00:02:37,189
No, I'm not. I'm just looking to find out more about the world.

27
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,313
And if it turns out there is a simple ultimate law that explains everything, so be it.

28
00:02:41,353 --> 00:02:42,694
That would be very nice discovery.

29
00:02:43,194 --> 00:02:48,698
If it turns out it's like an onion with millions of layers and we're just sick and tired of looking at the layers, then that's the way it is.

30
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:53,762
But whatever way it comes out, it's nature is there and she's going to come out the way she is.

31
00:02:54,642 --> 00:03:00,607
And therefore, when we go to investigate it, we shouldn't pre-decide what it is we're trying to do, except to find out more about it.

32
00:03:02,068 --> 00:03:08,693
You see, one thing is I can live with doubt and uncertainty and not knowing.

33
00:03:09,373 --> 00:03:14,997
I think it's much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong.

34
00:03:16,922 --> 00:03:21,446
I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of certainty about different things,

35
00:03:21,806 --> 00:03:25,689
but I'm not absolutely sure of anything, and there are many things I don't know anything about.

36
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:31,955
But I don't have to know an answer. I don't have to. I don't feel frightened by not knowing things,

37
00:03:33,376 --> 00:03:36,859
by being lost in the mysterious universe without having any purpose,

38
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:41,163
which is the way it really is, as far as I can tell, possible. It doesn't frighten me.

39
00:03:42,683 --> 00:03:47,306
And so altogether I can't believe the special stories that have been made up

40
00:03:48,347 --> 00:03:51,068
about our relationship to the universe at large because

41
00:03:53,309 --> 00:03:53,950
they seem to be

42
00:03:56,871 --> 00:03:58,752
too simple, too connected,

43
00:04:00,013 --> 00:04:03,135
too local, too provincial. The earth, he came to the earth.

44
00:04:04,135 --> 00:04:07,797
One of the aspects of God came to the earth, mind you.

45
00:04:08,278 --> 00:04:11,800
And look at what's out there, how can it, it isn't in proportion.

46
00:04:15,748 --> 00:04:26,057
Anyway, it's no use arguing. I can't argue it. I'm just trying to tell you, with the scientific view, or my father's view, that we should look to see what's true and what may be, may not be true.

47
00:04:26,197 --> 00:04:34,345
Once you start doubting, which I think to me is a very fundamental part of my soul, is to doubt and to ask.

48
00:04:34,785 --> 00:04:38,568
And when you doubt and ask, it gets a little harder to believe.

49
00:04:46,624 --> 00:04:50,948
That was nice, right?

50
00:04:51,628 --> 00:04:57,212
It would take quite a lot of nerve to attempt to follow Richard Feynman.

51
00:04:58,293 --> 00:05:01,055
So instead, let's make Walt Whitman do it.

52
00:05:02,957 --> 00:05:06,159
This is a poem called When I Heard the Learned Astronomer.

53
00:05:08,456 --> 00:05:13,341
When I heard the learned astronomer, when the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns

54
00:05:13,441 --> 00:05:18,626
before me, when I was shown the charts and diagrams to add, divide, and measure them,

55
00:05:19,407 --> 00:05:23,431
when I, sitting, heard the astronomer, where he lectured with much applause in the lecture

56
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:27,816
room, how soon, unaccountable, I became tired and sick.

57
00:05:28,921 --> 00:05:35,264
Till rising and gliding out I wandered off by myself in the mystical moist night air

58
00:05:36,104 --> 00:05:41,527
and from time to time looked up in perfect silence at the stars.

59
00:05:43,745 --> 00:05:48,427
So there we have a scientist and a poet, each in their own way, addressing the topic that

60
00:05:48,507 --> 00:05:52,769
I want to talk about today, which is these two different ways of looking at the world,

61
00:05:53,610 --> 00:06:00,213
like a scientist or like a poet, and the tension between them, and what games have to tell

62
00:06:00,273 --> 00:06:04,175
us about this tension, and what this tension has to tell us about games.

63
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:10,214
So, with apologies to Walt Whitman, let me arrange in columns before you some of the

64
00:06:10,254 --> 00:06:12,638
words we use to describe these two ways of looking at the world.

65
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:18,588
Thought versus feeling, intellect versus emotion, rationality versus intuition.

66
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:25,124
On the one side, the realm of science and logic, and on the other, art and morality.

67
00:06:25,224 --> 00:06:29,188
Here the domain of reducing, explaining, measuring, and objective truth.

68
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:36,055
And over here, the domain of the irreducible, the inexplicable, the immeasurable, and subjective

69
00:06:36,115 --> 00:06:36,375
truth.

70
00:06:37,236 --> 00:06:41,861
So whatever words you want to use, I think we can all recognize these two broad categories

71
00:06:41,921 --> 00:06:42,822
of human understanding.

72
00:06:43,766 --> 00:06:49,631
So the basic idea of this talk is that the relationship between these two categories is important,

73
00:06:50,372 --> 00:06:52,734
that it's worth talking and thinking about,

74
00:06:53,134 --> 00:06:57,237
that it's especially important now at this particular moment in human history,

75
00:06:57,818 --> 00:07:01,821
and that games have something valuable to contribute to this conversation.

76
00:07:03,662 --> 00:07:08,546
So one common way that this tension gets framed in recent discussions around games is like this.

77
00:07:09,186 --> 00:07:12,589
On the one hand, associated with the general ideas of logic and rationality,

78
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:15,691
you have traditional, more structured games with explicit goals,

79
00:07:16,012 --> 00:07:18,554
a focus on competition, on winning and losing,

80
00:07:19,014 --> 00:07:20,475
problem solving in general,

81
00:07:20,856 --> 00:07:25,219
a focus on systems and the idea of what some people call instrumental play.

82
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:31,164
You know, imagine power gamers min-maxing, trying to find optimal solutions and that kind of thing.

83
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:36,613
And then on the other hand, associated with the general ideas of feeling and emotion,

84
00:07:36,653 --> 00:07:41,554
you have less traditional games with less focus on structured goals and more focus on

85
00:07:41,675 --> 00:07:46,536
open-ended exploration, on setting, theme, and story, on the moment-to-moment quality

86
00:07:46,576 --> 00:07:51,457
of the player's experience, and on improvisational and imaginative play.

87
00:07:51,857 --> 00:07:56,378
So this is the way that the attention is framed by, for example, people like Jenova Chen when

88
00:07:56,418 --> 00:07:57,378
he talks about wanting to...

89
00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:06,647
expand the palette of emotions in games, expand their emotional range, or by people like David Cage when he talks about emotion and meaning,

90
00:08:07,668 --> 00:08:15,335
or by scholars like Miguel Sicart, who wants us to focus less on rules and on the procedural logics of game systems,

91
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:18,538
and pay more attention to the creative power of players.

92
00:08:20,274 --> 00:08:24,216
One of the, I think, most eloquent articulations of this way of framing games

93
00:08:24,636 --> 00:08:28,538
comes from the composer and musician and thinker David Kanega, who has written a lot of

94
00:08:29,318 --> 00:08:32,740
really interesting stuff about these ideas. Here's a quote from David.

95
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,801
Here's the massive tension.

96
00:08:35,521 --> 00:08:38,783
Games are both playful, irrational things, and highly structural things.

97
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:43,645
And integrating the reality of these apparently contradictory tendencies is maybe the most

98
00:08:43,685 --> 00:08:44,125
important

99
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,086
baffling work there is to do

100
00:08:46,486 --> 00:08:47,107
in design,

101
00:08:47,587 --> 00:08:48,727
theory, and play.

102
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:53,146
Right now, the rational aspect of games is way overrepresented.

103
00:08:54,823 --> 00:08:59,546
I agree with David that this is important work and this is basically the work that I

104
00:08:59,626 --> 00:09:01,267
want to try to do here today.

105
00:09:01,947 --> 00:09:06,109
But I don't agree with the general approach that separates these different aspects into

106
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:12,032
two categories, two different kinds of ingredients, the rational and the emotional, and talks

107
00:09:12,072 --> 00:09:14,494
about having less of one and more of the other.

108
00:09:15,214 --> 00:09:20,297
My approach to integrating these forces is totally different, and it starts with a close

109
00:09:20,337 --> 00:09:23,318
examination of what it feels like to play this game.

110
00:09:25,128 --> 00:09:31,551
QWOP. This is a game created by Bennett Foddy, a friend of mine and a colleague who teaches

111
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:36,153
with me at the NYU Game Center. So what's it like to play QWOP? Well, to begin with,

112
00:09:36,213 --> 00:09:42,256
here's this thing that we take for granted, walking. We do it with a fluid grace, a natural,

113
00:09:42,576 --> 00:09:47,478
instinctual behavior, and we're used to doing it in video games in the same way, naturally,

114
00:09:47,858 --> 00:09:53,321
gracefully, fluidly. So what happens when we make it deliberate, conscious?

115
00:09:54,096 --> 00:09:59,380
Well, it's a nightmare, but it's also hilarious, and it's also strangely beautiful.

116
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,204
In playing a game like this, you become aware of awareness.

117
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:10,764
what are my fingers doing? It's like I'm aware of them for the first time.

118
00:10:11,085 --> 00:10:15,048
I feel the strands of energy connecting my mind to my fingers.

119
00:10:15,388 --> 00:10:18,070
Oh, this is what it feels like to do something.

120
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:23,455
It's so ubiquitous I'd forgotten what it feels like. I feel the contours of this

121
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:27,558
complicated interactive system, this tiny stylized slice of the world.

122
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:30,921
I struggle to develop explicit theories about it.

123
00:10:31,301 --> 00:10:33,903
I poke at it with trial and error and then

124
00:10:34,464 --> 00:10:35,785
slowly painfully...

125
00:10:36,285 --> 00:10:37,567
I build an understanding.

126
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:42,492
And then slowly, it starts to become fluid again.

127
00:10:42,512 --> 00:10:45,374
I rebuild a new kind of intuition.

128
00:10:45,815 --> 00:10:48,998
And eventually, I'm walking a little bit.

129
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,781
So here we have nothing but instrumental play.

130
00:10:53,321 --> 00:10:57,222
It's just a goal constrained by rules that we are attempting to master through deliberate

131
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:57,562
effort.

132
00:10:58,262 --> 00:11:04,544
But playing QWOP doesn't feel like a celebration of the cold, Apollonian power of deliberate

133
00:11:04,584 --> 00:11:05,404
and rational thought.

134
00:11:05,644 --> 00:11:07,665
It feels like a parody of rational thought.

135
00:11:08,445 --> 00:11:16,167
It feels Dionysian, atavistic, like some primal ritual that takes place in the boiler room

136
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:17,107
of our brain.

137
00:11:18,362 --> 00:11:24,046
QWOP is like a microscope that magnifies the hidden operations of our mind as it struggles

138
00:11:24,126 --> 00:11:25,407
to think and do.

139
00:11:26,327 --> 00:11:29,970
All of the thoughts and emotions that are normally invisible to us because they are

140
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,711
the very stuff that we are made out of.

141
00:11:33,752 --> 00:11:36,534
It is thought made visible to itself.

142
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:42,675
And this quality of games, their ability to give us a window into how our minds operate,

143
00:11:42,715 --> 00:11:46,416
is something that I think you will find over and over again if you pay close attention

144
00:11:46,796 --> 00:11:48,476
to what it actually feels like to play a game.

145
00:11:49,496 --> 00:11:52,257
And this quality is central to my understanding of what games are.

146
00:11:52,757 --> 00:11:58,739
All games, from the most competitive, rule-bound systems to the most anarchic, free-form play

147
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,139
spaces.

148
00:12:00,712 --> 00:12:07,201
You can feel the same quality of thought made visible to itself when you start solving Sudoku puzzles, or really any kind of puzzle.

149
00:12:07,862 --> 00:12:17,034
First you develop explicit low-level theories which you consciously apply, like a child mouthing the shapes of letters in order to figure out the words.

150
00:12:17,755 --> 00:12:20,656
Then eventually you internalize these low-level rules.

151
00:12:20,696 --> 00:12:22,497
They become second nature.

152
00:12:22,537 --> 00:12:28,039
You apply them naturally, effortlessly, and you start developing new, higher-level methods,

153
00:12:28,099 --> 00:12:31,000
which again you apply deliberately and consciously.

154
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,622
Then those too become internalized, become automatic, unconscious, natural.

155
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:40,244
And you start developing even higher-level methods, strategies, and heuristics, and so

156
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,924
on up the ladder of expertise.

157
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:47,802
And there's a beauty in Sudoku beyond the satisfaction of effort and reward,

158
00:12:48,123 --> 00:12:51,164
beyond the pleasure of starting with a few threads of data

159
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,385
and weaving them into a blanket of knowledge,

160
00:12:53,846 --> 00:12:57,688
beyond the comfort of repetitious, deliberate mechanical thinking.

161
00:12:58,188 --> 00:13:02,350
The real beauty is in getting an opportunity to glimpse this process

162
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:06,993
of our own minds climbing the ladder of what it feels like to learn something.

163
00:13:08,074 --> 00:13:12,075
It's like squirting dye into the water in order to see the complex currents that flow

164
00:13:12,115 --> 00:13:12,456
through it.

165
00:13:13,056 --> 00:13:14,636
It is thought made visible to itself.

166
00:13:15,437 --> 00:13:17,037
You can feel it when you play a racing game.

167
00:13:17,577 --> 00:13:23,279
When you start out, you're pushing the buttons deliberately, consciously, thumping and scraping

168
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:25,400
around the track, seeing the corner come up.

169
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,381
You're telling yourself, oh, here comes that corner, get ready to turn.

170
00:13:28,701 --> 00:13:33,883
You go around the track bumping, shuddering, pressing buttons, your eyes mouthing the shapes

171
00:13:33,983 --> 00:13:37,204
of the upcoming turns out loud so that your thumbs can respond.

172
00:13:38,224 --> 00:13:41,626
Around and around and with each lap, something amazing happens.

173
00:13:42,206 --> 00:13:45,868
Incrementally, bit by bit, your mind creates new passageways

174
00:13:45,948 --> 00:13:47,329
between your eyes and your thumbs.

175
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:51,411
Your eyes dig the grooves of the track deeper and deeper into your memory banks,

176
00:13:51,992 --> 00:13:54,193
like a song that starts out as notes on a graph,

177
00:13:54,493 --> 00:13:57,174
plucking them out deliberately, instrumentally,

178
00:13:57,675 --> 00:14:01,077
and then becomes a habit, second nature, automatic,

179
00:14:01,237 --> 00:14:03,298
and then becomes something more, a part of you.

180
00:14:03,578 --> 00:14:04,939
This thing that was out there in the world

181
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:07,480
is now just a part of you that you can do things with.

182
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,221
And you can feel it. You can feel it.

183
00:14:11,382 --> 00:14:15,643
This thing that happens all the time, now it's happening right in front of your eyes.

184
00:14:16,284 --> 00:14:18,425
And you can feel it taking shape in your hands.

185
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,366
Things that used to be decisions become actions.

186
00:14:23,607 --> 00:14:26,428
Things that used to be actions become nothing.

187
00:14:27,748 --> 00:14:33,171
Just you, flying around the track, empty-headed, lighter than air, hovering.

188
00:14:33,951 --> 00:14:35,131
Just you and the Chemical Brothers.

189
00:14:37,346 --> 00:14:41,642
Consider the worst thing that can happen to a baseball pitcher, or any athlete really,

190
00:14:42,123 --> 00:14:42,826
which is to choke.

191
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:49,518
To choke means to become consciously aware of a complex action that should be natural,

192
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,659
fluid, effortless.

193
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:55,420
All of a sudden you're trying to deliberately move your body in the correct way.

194
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:59,921
Instead of the effortless glide through the moist night air under the stars, instead of

195
00:15:00,161 --> 00:15:04,962
that you have the proofs and figures of your arms and legs and they're arranged in columns

196
00:15:05,022 --> 00:15:07,623
before you and you're trying to add, divide, and measure them.

197
00:15:08,043 --> 00:15:13,004
You're stuck in the beginner's mind, too aware of the basic step-by-step methods behind the

198
00:15:13,044 --> 00:15:14,084
action that you're trying to execute.

199
00:15:15,525 --> 00:15:18,786
Or consider the worst thing that can happen to a poker player, which is to go on tilt.

200
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,368
Tilting is sort of the opposite of choking, in a way.

201
00:15:21,748 --> 00:15:26,950
When you tilt, your emotions get the better of you, and you become unable to apply simple

202
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,432
principles in a conscious, deliberate way.

203
00:15:30,052 --> 00:15:34,794
You lose the ability to slow down and think through the basics that you learned when you

204
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:35,295
were a beginner.

205
00:15:36,175 --> 00:15:40,937
Your instincts overwhelm you, and they prevent you from applying the careful, step-by-step

206
00:15:40,977 --> 00:15:42,918
methods that would prevent disaster.

207
00:15:43,955 --> 00:15:48,637
So in a very important way, in addition to being a game about reading the mind of your opponent,

208
00:15:49,197 --> 00:15:50,958
poker is a game about reading your own mind.

209
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:56,081
Now I'm not saying that every game always provides this experience,

210
00:15:56,882 --> 00:15:58,262
thought made visible to itself,

211
00:15:59,023 --> 00:16:03,125
the ability to become aware of the operation of one's own mind as it interacts with the world.

212
00:16:03,885 --> 00:16:06,487
But I am saying that it is the potential of every game.

213
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,648
Every game is a chance to have this experience.

214
00:16:10,766 --> 00:16:14,467
And this isn't meant to describe some kind of elevated super intellectual experience.

215
00:16:14,947 --> 00:16:19,508
This quality is present even in silly games, in stupid games, especially in stupid games.

216
00:16:20,068 --> 00:16:24,430
The games that we play to blunt the edges of our mind, to silence its incessant chatter,

217
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,490
or to get in touch with our primal instincts.

218
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:31,752
These too are a way of our mind spinning around trying to get a look at itself.

219
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,763
This quality is present even in the most self-destructive, manipulative, addictive games.

220
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:42,825
How often have you found yourself dragging the hook of some potentially addictive game

221
00:16:43,326 --> 00:16:45,567
across the surface of your brain, seeing if it will catch?

222
00:16:46,527 --> 00:16:49,669
This too is a way of mapping out the contours of our minds.

223
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,992
All games, abstract or story-based, physical or digital, rule-bound and competitive or

224
00:16:56,072 --> 00:17:00,435
open-ended and improvisational, are about thinking and doing.

225
00:17:01,847 --> 00:17:07,270
This is what we mean by interactivity, whether it's Sid Meier's interesting choices or Kanega's

226
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:13,253
improvisational free play, games are the realm of thinking and doing, thought and action,

227
00:17:13,813 --> 00:17:16,815
the mind, the will, engaging with the world.

228
00:17:18,396 --> 00:17:25,600
Thinking and doing is to games what looking is to painting, what listening is to music.

229
00:17:27,196 --> 00:17:32,780
In our normal lives, thinking and doing are ubiquitous, pervasive, and therefore invisible to us.

230
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:37,543
When we decide to get out of bed, when we walk across the room to open the door, when

231
00:17:37,603 --> 00:17:41,546
we choose the words that we want to say to a friend, when we get dressed and go to work,

232
00:17:41,826 --> 00:17:47,029
we are thinking, doing, choosing, acting, judging, deciding, exploring, learning.

233
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:51,792
But when we do these things in a game, we're doing them for their own sake.

234
00:17:52,673 --> 00:17:54,935
And that's what makes games an aesthetic form.

235
00:17:56,367 --> 00:18:00,069
When we look at a painting, we surrender to the experience of looking.

236
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:01,870
We immerse ourselves in it.

237
00:18:02,891 --> 00:18:04,652
We're also consciously aware of looking.

238
00:18:05,513 --> 00:18:08,655
This thing that we do all the time without thinking about it, we become aware of our

239
00:18:08,695 --> 00:18:12,257
own perception of light and color and shape and texture.

240
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:17,180
And when we play a game, we surrender ourselves to the experience of thinking and doing.

241
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,741
We immerse ourselves in it.

242
00:18:19,662 --> 00:18:21,683
We're also consciously aware of thinking and doing.

243
00:18:22,123 --> 00:18:23,624
This thing that is normally invisible.

244
00:18:24,392 --> 00:18:28,254
we become aware of the shape and texture of the operation of our own mind.

245
00:18:29,095 --> 00:18:30,816
This is a kind of a double movement.

246
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:36,699
We're plunging forward and immersing ourselves in an experience while also leaning back to

247
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,461
frame it, to become aware of it, conscious of it.

248
00:18:40,282 --> 00:18:43,103
This is what aesthetic experiences allow us.

249
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:47,646
And games are the aesthetic form of thinking and doing.

250
00:18:48,641 --> 00:18:54,086
interactivity, thought and action, decoupled from actual purpose and experienced for its own sake,

251
00:18:54,606 --> 00:18:59,851
so that we can indulge ourselves in it, understand it, reflect on its myriad different forms,

252
00:19:00,331 --> 00:19:04,475
looking for meaning and beauty. And really, when we talk about thinking and doing,

253
00:19:04,815 --> 00:19:06,857
we're basically talking about instrumental reason.

254
00:19:07,862 --> 00:19:14,047
Not in the negative sense of cold logic and mechanical execution, but in the simple sense

255
00:19:14,067 --> 00:19:20,292
that any thinking, doing mind is making plans and acting on them, observing the world, forming

256
00:19:20,332 --> 00:19:25,896
hypotheses, making and updating models, learning, pursuing goals, solving problems, interacting

257
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:26,757
with the world around it.

258
00:19:27,557 --> 00:19:33,242
When we play games, we do these things for their own sake, as a kind of delirious ritual.

259
00:19:34,802 --> 00:19:37,983
Games are the aesthetic form of instrumental reason.

260
00:19:39,103 --> 00:19:40,983
Games are interactivity as an art form.

261
00:19:41,003 --> 00:19:46,185
They are about choices and consequences, actions and outcomes, about using our minds to learn,

262
00:19:46,265 --> 00:19:47,445
understand and do things.

263
00:19:48,226 --> 00:19:52,967
An art form whose raw material is instrumental reason, the thing that defines us as humans,

264
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:55,788
the creatures who occupy the cognitive niche.

265
00:19:56,868 --> 00:20:01,070
This quality that is invisible to us because it's the stuff that we're made out of.

266
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:06,524
Now this doesn't mean that games are merely a celebration of instrumental reason.

267
00:20:06,564 --> 00:20:07,625
It's far from it.

268
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:12,068
What they are is an opportunity to reflect on instrumental reason, to contemplate it,

269
00:20:12,168 --> 00:20:12,988
investigate it.

270
00:20:13,869 --> 00:20:17,151
Yes, in games we often indulge our capacity for instrumental reason.

271
00:20:17,171 --> 00:20:22,295
We take it off the leash and allow it to run wild, just as we sometimes smother it or invert

272
00:20:22,315 --> 00:20:22,395
it.

273
00:20:23,075 --> 00:20:28,879
The main idea is that games are where we think and do for its own sake, just to do it.

274
00:20:29,905 --> 00:20:32,185
In games we build roofs that don't keep out the rain.

275
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:34,326
We search for treasure that can't be spent.

276
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,266
We fight enemies that can't harm us.

277
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,547
We rescue children that aren't in danger.

278
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:40,687
We solve problems that don't exist.

279
00:20:42,028 --> 00:20:44,468
We do these things in pursuit of meaning and beauty,

280
00:20:45,309 --> 00:20:48,069
because that's what aesthetic forms are.

281
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,490
And here's the crux of the matter.

282
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,470
Because games are an aesthetic form,

283
00:20:52,831 --> 00:20:55,571
that means they are utterly, completely

284
00:20:55,831 --> 00:20:58,532
on the right side of the dotted line that we drew earlier.

285
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:04,961
The essential property of aesthetics is that it's not the domain of the logical and the rational.

286
00:21:05,021 --> 00:21:08,485
It is the domain of the subjective, the realm of the irreducible.

287
00:21:09,473 --> 00:21:14,135
Games can be beautiful or ugly, sublime or ridiculous, entertaining or boring.

288
00:21:14,455 --> 00:21:20,157
We can never ever produce evidence that proves definitively which of these things any particular

289
00:21:20,197 --> 00:21:20,617
game is.

290
00:21:21,317 --> 00:21:26,679
The realm of the aesthetic is the realm of judgment, taste, pleasure and pain, sensation

291
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:27,379
and experience.

292
00:21:27,639 --> 00:21:31,040
You can't prove something is beautiful with logic or facts.

293
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,621
You can only appeal to shared subjective experience.

294
00:21:35,863 --> 00:21:42,126
to try to forge connections of common feeling and establish communities of agreement or

295
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:42,986
useful debate.

296
00:21:44,266 --> 00:21:49,909
And that's the job of aesthetics, to be the domain beyond the practical, beyond the logical,

297
00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:55,771
to be immeasurable, inexplicable, but at the same time allow this process by which we weave

298
00:21:56,051 --> 00:22:02,014
our individual experiences together into something shared, shared values and shared humanity.

299
00:22:03,719 --> 00:22:06,283
look at what kind of aesthetic form they are.

300
00:22:06,944 --> 00:22:08,726
They are the aesthetic form of instrumental reason.

301
00:22:09,267 --> 00:22:10,268
And this makes them different.

302
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:13,272
This makes them a very different kind of aesthetic form.

303
00:22:13,853 --> 00:22:15,195
Because despite being an aesthetic form,

304
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:17,658
games have objective truth in them.

305
00:22:19,201 --> 00:22:23,084
And because of this, they belong, in a sense, on the left side of the dotted line,

306
00:22:23,805 --> 00:22:27,087
along with science and logic and evidence and rationality.

307
00:22:27,868 --> 00:22:30,510
So what do I mean by saying games have objective truth in them?

308
00:22:31,831 --> 00:22:34,153
Take chess, for example. When you look at a position in chess,

309
00:22:35,094 --> 00:22:36,195
some moves are winning moves.

310
00:22:37,061 --> 00:22:41,985
and some moves are losing moves, and this is simply an objective fact about this position.

311
00:22:42,266 --> 00:22:49,172
And in fact, the beauty of chess is in searching for and discovering and debating about this truth.

312
00:22:50,433 --> 00:22:53,435
This search for truth, this process of asking questions,

313
00:22:53,996 --> 00:22:55,857
what happens when you do this instead of this?

314
00:22:56,398 --> 00:22:57,419
Or is this possible?

315
00:22:57,739 --> 00:22:58,720
Or does this work?

316
00:22:59,621 --> 00:23:02,023
There are versions of this across all games.

317
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:09,712
Games are conversations between players, designers, and the world.

318
00:23:10,612 --> 00:23:11,032
The world.

319
00:23:12,313 --> 00:23:13,353
The empirical world.

320
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:15,174
The positivist world.

321
00:23:15,254 --> 00:23:20,795
The old-fashioned, naturalistic, material world with its stubborn, inert truth.

322
00:23:21,796 --> 00:23:25,477
That world is a participant in the conversation.

323
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:30,714
Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that this is the same conversation that science

324
00:23:30,774 --> 00:23:30,914
is.

325
00:23:31,474 --> 00:23:33,896
I'm not trying to reduce games to science or math.

326
00:23:34,736 --> 00:23:36,517
Because remember, games are an aesthetic form.

327
00:23:36,857 --> 00:23:42,901
This conversation that's happening is about beauty and meaning, pleasure and disgust,

328
00:23:43,161 --> 00:23:45,723
direct experience leading to shared values.

329
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:52,784
The words of this conversation might include explanation, evidence, logic, proof, but the

330
00:23:52,824 --> 00:23:58,049
conversation itself is irreducible, inexplicable, mysterious.

331
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:05,157
For example, in chess, each individual game of chess, each position, can be broken down

332
00:24:05,197 --> 00:24:08,520
and analyzed with logic, but the act of playing chess

333
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:15,431
Devoting your life to this ridiculous thing, developing the self-control needed to master this discipline,

334
00:24:15,732 --> 00:24:22,373
waking up early every day to study books and to drill yourself on this arcane skill,

335
00:24:22,734 --> 00:24:26,975
going to tournaments, these elaborate rituals where you test yourself against other people.

336
00:24:27,555 --> 00:24:29,516
This isn't logical. It's bonkers.

337
00:24:30,316 --> 00:24:32,636
I mean, there may be objective truth in games.

338
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:39,507
But the truths that emerge from games, their ultimate meaning, is the other kind of truth.

339
00:24:41,609 --> 00:24:44,973
In Ode on a Grecian Urn, the poet John Keats says,

340
00:24:45,774 --> 00:24:48,737
Beauty is truth, truth beauty.

341
00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:54,424
And nowhere is this more true, I believe, than in games.

342
00:24:57,289 --> 00:25:02,591
This is what puts games in such an interesting position relative to the two cultures, as

343
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:03,491
C.P. Snow called them.

344
00:25:04,532 --> 00:25:09,433
When we make and play games, we are actively straddling these two realms, these two domains.

345
00:25:10,094 --> 00:25:16,316
And not by picking and choosing between them, but by being wholly absorbed in both simultaneously.

346
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:21,338
By drilling down to the point where they are the same, and ascending to the point where

347
00:25:21,358 --> 00:25:22,178
you can't tell them apart.

348
00:25:24,883 --> 00:25:29,626
not by using rational thought and technology to deliver beauty and pleasure and meaning,

349
00:25:30,667 --> 00:25:36,071
and not by having pretty pictures and compelling stories side-by-side with, or on top of, or

350
00:25:36,151 --> 00:25:41,755
instead of, systems of choices and actions and outcomes, but by being the aesthetic form

351
00:25:42,295 --> 00:25:44,557
of choices and actions and outcomes.

352
00:25:45,858 --> 00:25:52,162
In games, we pursue thinking and doing for its own sake, which makes them both a violent

353
00:25:52,282 --> 00:25:54,224
plunge into the heart of instrumental reason.

354
00:25:55,448 --> 00:26:02,454
but also means that they are outside of instrumental reason, a kind of escape that goes not around,

355
00:26:02,634 --> 00:26:10,461
but through. Look, I know that it's wrong to say that games are one thing or another

356
00:26:10,501 --> 00:26:15,505
thing. Games are whatever we want. I know that. So I guess really what I'm saying is

357
00:26:15,545 --> 00:26:19,388
that this is what games are for me. This is how I see them.

358
00:26:21,141 --> 00:26:26,605
In my vision, games are about discovering the beauty and pleasure in instrumental reason.

359
00:26:26,705 --> 00:26:29,488
Games are laboratories for thought and action.

360
00:26:29,868 --> 00:26:32,490
They're a way for thought to become visible to itself.

361
00:26:33,571 --> 00:26:39,175
Opportunities to investigate the relationship between the deliberate, the rational, and

362
00:26:39,195 --> 00:26:41,878
the intuitive, the instinctual, the subconscious.

363
00:26:43,598 --> 00:26:44,919
So often what players are doing

364
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:50,821
is actually a kind of science, a version of the scientific process as play.

365
00:26:51,741 --> 00:26:53,982
You see it obviously in any game with theory crafting where

366
00:26:54,422 --> 00:26:57,103
players devote themselves to reverse engineering the game systems,

367
00:26:57,724 --> 00:27:01,165
using instrumental reason to discover objective facts about the world of the game,

368
00:27:02,085 --> 00:27:03,406
or when they're just goofing off.

369
00:27:04,566 --> 00:27:05,367
Load the jump program.

370
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,462
ignoring the ostensible goals of the game

371
00:27:10,502 --> 00:27:12,385
and just toying with the physics of the world.

372
00:27:13,186 --> 00:27:15,528
This is also an activity that's both playful and scientific.

373
00:27:16,089 --> 00:27:17,931
Can you get the word hog to the top of the cliff?

374
00:27:18,732 --> 00:27:19,093
I don't know.

375
00:27:19,814 --> 00:27:20,194
Can you?

376
00:27:21,276 --> 00:27:21,796
Let's find out.

377
00:27:41,134 --> 00:27:42,595
On the roots where we feel

378
00:28:22,736 --> 00:28:26,400
I mean, this is someone ignoring the rules of the game, right?

379
00:28:26,701 --> 00:28:29,043
This is someone appropriating the game

380
00:28:29,103 --> 00:28:31,727
to do something that's totally orthogonal to what

381
00:28:31,747 --> 00:28:32,588
you're supposed to do.

382
00:28:34,169 --> 00:28:39,035
And yet it's like a pure form of instrumental reason run wild.

383
00:28:41,724 --> 00:28:45,229
uh... another example of uh... play science that i love is when players are

384
00:28:45,389 --> 00:28:47,111
taking a game super seriously

385
00:28:47,131 --> 00:28:51,036
uh... trying to discover what it would mean to pursue the goal of the game as

386
00:28:51,156 --> 00:28:52,217
hard as you can as

387
00:28:52,517 --> 00:28:53,599
as they do in speed running

388
00:28:54,532 --> 00:29:01,036
One of the things I love so much about Half-Life speedruns is that the game of Half-Life is

389
00:29:01,076 --> 00:29:06,560
a game on its surface which is about scientists discovering hidden truths about physics and

390
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,421
using that knowledge to warp space and time.

391
00:29:08,941 --> 00:29:15,306
When players speedrun Half-Life, they are actual scientists discovering actual hidden

392
00:29:15,366 --> 00:29:20,609
truths about the actual world of Half-Life and using that knowledge to actually warp

393
00:29:20,689 --> 00:29:21,470
space and time.

394
00:29:23,009 --> 00:29:24,331
It's so beautiful about that.

395
00:29:24,351 --> 00:29:26,053
It happens in Zelda too.

396
00:29:26,414 --> 00:29:27,395
It's real magic.

397
00:29:28,096 --> 00:29:32,242
In Zelda when you see someone use a chicken to like open up a gate under, you know what

398
00:29:32,262 --> 00:29:36,088
I mean, through space time, under a well, it's real magic.

399
00:29:36,148 --> 00:29:37,670
That's what magic actually is.

400
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:45,407
And you see play science in any deep competitive game, obviously.

401
00:29:45,668 --> 00:29:50,871
The fighting game community in particular is defined by this intense communal ongoing

402
00:29:50,912 --> 00:29:56,015
process of analyzing, reverse engineering, theory building, and experimentation.

403
00:29:56,776 --> 00:30:01,139
When they discover a new move or a new corner in the game's combination space, they call

404
00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:01,820
it new tech.

405
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:08,304
High level competitive gamers are a strange mix of athlete, scientist, and artist.

406
00:30:09,727 --> 00:30:12,807
You also see it in the least serious, least competitive games.

407
00:30:12,847 --> 00:30:16,648
For example, in the simple trial and error of an Angry Birds player.

408
00:30:17,728 --> 00:30:25,510
And I think that this spirit is present even in the most anti-system, anti-goal, anti-problem-solving

409
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,650
twine games of the zinester underground.

410
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:32,731
Yes, these games are often about expressing a personal story.

411
00:30:32,751 --> 00:30:34,151
But you know what else they're about?

412
00:30:34,731 --> 00:30:38,192
They're about encoding your personal story as software.

413
00:30:39,968 --> 00:30:46,730
And they're also about insisting that we break down the division between player and creator,

414
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:51,391
about insisting absolutely correctly on the importance of players becoming creators,

415
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:56,512
learning how to navigate the logic gates and symbolic operations of twine,

416
00:30:56,832 --> 00:31:03,013
in which, unlike poems or paintings, your story can simply work or not work,

417
00:31:03,393 --> 00:31:09,014
can be broken in a way that is simply, objectively, beautifully true.

418
00:31:11,115 --> 00:31:14,540
I think this is one of the main reasons that making games is so difficult.

419
00:31:15,281 --> 00:31:19,368
Making games combines everything that's hard about building a bridge and everything that's

420
00:31:19,408 --> 00:31:20,670
hard about composing an opera.

421
00:31:21,872 --> 00:31:25,297
Games are basically operas made out of bridges.

422
00:31:28,022 --> 00:31:34,446
Games can be broken in ways that are simply objectively true, and not just at the level of code, but at the level of design.

423
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:40,189
You can say, oh, this choice here is dominated by this one, it's never useful, never makes sense.

424
00:31:40,729 --> 00:31:44,791
It's a weird way to design, but we recognize this sensation, right?

425
00:31:45,052 --> 00:31:47,693
This strange form of design that has a lot of engineering in it.

426
00:31:48,453 --> 00:31:53,496
Not just at the level of technique, but in its deepest, most creative dimensions.

427
00:31:54,297 --> 00:31:55,338
Or maybe it's not so strange.

428
00:31:55,639 --> 00:31:57,521
Maybe it's just something that we forgot a long time ago

429
00:31:58,002 --> 00:31:59,223
and we're only now remembering.

430
00:31:59,944 --> 00:32:01,747
Maybe what's strange is treating bridge building

431
00:32:02,007 --> 00:32:05,552
and opera composing like they're totally separate specializations

432
00:32:05,712 --> 00:32:06,433
that shouldn't overlap.

433
00:32:07,812 --> 00:32:12,713
But you know, this mix of the objective and the subjective in games is hard to navigate,

434
00:32:13,033 --> 00:32:14,814
and it leads to a lot of strange detours.

435
00:32:15,494 --> 00:32:21,336
Like academic white papers that seem to miss the fact that games are culture, and instead

436
00:32:21,476 --> 00:32:25,638
treat them as some kind of special technology, a certain type of simulated environment.

437
00:32:25,918 --> 00:32:27,578
Here's a quote from this paper, for example.

438
00:32:27,938 --> 00:32:31,339
Video games provide virtual environments in which opportunities for action are manifold.

439
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:35,081
The growth of participation in these environments suggests that they can be highly motivating.

440
00:32:35,401 --> 00:32:37,682
Though little empirical research has explained this phenomenon.

441
00:32:38,182 --> 00:32:40,585
Or accounted for why some games are more popular than others.

442
00:32:41,706 --> 00:32:42,968
Oh, good luck with that, guys.

443
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:46,692
Good luck explaining frog fractions with that framework.

444
00:32:47,513 --> 00:32:48,394
Or Flappy Bird.

445
00:32:49,135 --> 00:32:52,779
Right? Or explaining the subtle difference between Dishonored and Bioshock Infinite.

446
00:32:53,957 --> 00:33:05,246
Game studies and honestly even game design discourse is really filled with overly systematic attempts to model player experience in order to make definitive empirical claims about how pleasure works.

447
00:33:05,907 --> 00:33:12,052
Which to me drastically misrepresents the endlessly subtle and slippery and elusive qualities of aesthetics.

448
00:33:12,112 --> 00:33:16,195
The qualities that, say, distinguish Super Mario World from Braid.

449
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:19,157
You will never see these things under a microscope.

450
00:33:20,118 --> 00:33:21,879
Games are not things you can put under a microscope.

451
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:23,951
Games are microscopes.

452
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:26,913
Games have microscopes in them.

453
00:33:28,654 --> 00:33:32,976
Here's another place where we see the struggle between bridge building and opera composing.

454
00:33:33,457 --> 00:33:36,659
The dilemma of quantitative, data-driven game design.

455
00:33:37,139 --> 00:33:39,340
So many of us have probably struggled with this tension directly.

456
00:33:39,861 --> 00:33:41,481
Many of us are probably struggling with it right now.

457
00:33:42,282 --> 00:33:43,183
So what's wrong with this stuff?

458
00:33:43,283 --> 00:33:47,925
Like, why isn't this just an extension of player-centric, playtesting-centric, humanist

459
00:33:47,945 --> 00:33:48,466
game design?

460
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:53,956
So here's an analogy that I like to tell about this tension.

461
00:33:54,756 --> 00:33:56,777
Imagine that you have a friend who's a guy,

462
00:33:57,217 --> 00:33:59,759
and he has trouble meeting women and forming relationships

463
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:00,139
with women.

464
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:02,320
And he tells you, I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

465
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,162
I go on a date, and I bring a thermometer

466
00:34:06,202 --> 00:34:07,843
so that I can measure their skin temperature.

467
00:34:08,943 --> 00:34:11,385
I bring calipers so I can measure their pupil

468
00:34:11,665 --> 00:34:13,325
to see when it's expanding and contracting.

469
00:34:13,726 --> 00:34:15,647
And I pay close attention to their reactions

470
00:34:15,707 --> 00:34:16,527
to the things I say.

471
00:34:17,087 --> 00:34:18,908
Somehow it just never seems to work out.

472
00:34:21,172 --> 00:34:26,195
The point is that it doesn't even matter if these are the correct things to measure,

473
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:29,016
if you were trying to predict someone's sexual arousal.

474
00:34:29,757 --> 00:34:32,699
If you bring a thermometer and calipers with you on a date,

475
00:34:32,939 --> 00:34:34,680
you're not going to be having sex.

476
00:34:39,163 --> 00:34:44,486
So all of these things, I think, point to a kind of a central dilemma about rationality

477
00:34:44,546 --> 00:34:47,068
itself, that it must have an outside.

478
00:34:48,256 --> 00:34:51,299
Because there's really only one important question worth asking, which is,

479
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,401
what is a life well lived?

480
00:34:54,262 --> 00:34:55,383
How should we live our lives?

481
00:34:56,124 --> 00:35:01,088
And that's a question that can't be answered, not by me, probably not by anyone ever.

482
00:35:01,529 --> 00:35:07,094
But one thing we can say with a lot of certainty, that a life well lived is not going to be

483
00:35:07,114 --> 00:35:13,060
a life in which every moment is scrutinized to see whether or not it's being well lived.

484
00:35:14,348 --> 00:35:15,848
You know, this is a central dilemma.

485
00:35:16,108 --> 00:35:20,249
This is an important, weird, hard, non-trivial problem

486
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:24,191
that's related maybe in some ways to like Godelian incompleteness.

487
00:35:26,511 --> 00:35:30,212
We also need to acknowledge, I think, as a field, as an entire field,

488
00:35:30,692 --> 00:35:32,393
that we have a kind of style problem.

489
00:35:34,253 --> 00:35:34,453
Right?

490
00:35:34,493 --> 00:35:36,614
I mean, games are an aesthetic form.

491
00:35:37,912 --> 00:35:42,694
But we have so much less of all those qualities on the right side of the chart

492
00:35:43,154 --> 00:35:44,274
than we would like to have.

493
00:35:44,835 --> 00:35:46,435
We are less subtle and sensitive.

494
00:35:46,996 --> 00:35:48,957
We are less suave and charismatic.

495
00:35:49,577 --> 00:35:51,338
We tend to be blunt and awkward.

496
00:35:51,918 --> 00:35:53,439
We are less charming and smooth.

497
00:35:54,439 --> 00:35:58,041
And this is a way of describing a general lack with our games.

498
00:35:58,961 --> 00:36:04,163
But it also describes a general characteristic of a lot of us as people.

499
00:36:05,472 --> 00:36:07,993
a lot of game creators and a lot of game players.

500
00:36:08,253 --> 00:36:10,174
And I think we need to address this honestly.

501
00:36:10,194 --> 00:36:12,795
I mean, there are two things I want to say about this.

502
00:36:13,455 --> 00:36:17,917
First, I think we need to embrace cognitive diversity.

503
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:19,778
There are different personality types.

504
00:36:20,858 --> 00:36:24,080
And we need to recognize that being an art form for the awkward,

505
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,361
for the obsessive, for folks on the spectrum, as they say,

506
00:36:28,101 --> 00:36:29,262
is nothing to be ashamed of.

507
00:36:30,204 --> 00:36:36,329
I mean, this is the personality type of scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and many philosophers.

508
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:46,377
And also, so often, suave sophistication and charm and charisma is camouflage for manipulation.

509
00:36:47,118 --> 00:36:47,739
Fuck that.

510
00:36:48,499 --> 00:36:53,563
Let's be proud of the fact that we are bringing more logic and precision into the world.

511
00:36:53,944 --> 00:36:56,586
That we care more about equations than haircuts.

512
00:36:56,826 --> 00:36:58,007
That's something to celebrate.

513
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:01,179
And yet, let's be honest.

514
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,940
And this is the second thing.

515
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:06,141
Let's be honest that we do care about haircuts.

516
00:37:07,181 --> 00:37:11,802
That we are embarrassed by our lack of style and charm and grace.

517
00:37:13,463 --> 00:37:16,944
We're embarrassed that our art form is still very dorky and awkward.

518
00:37:17,424 --> 00:37:19,024
Let's just admit it and work on it.

519
00:37:19,064 --> 00:37:21,085
Let's say that we want both.

520
00:37:22,005 --> 00:37:24,366
We want equations and haircuts.

521
00:37:24,766 --> 00:37:25,506
And we really do.

522
00:37:25,766 --> 00:37:27,346
And it's right to want both.

523
00:37:28,386 --> 00:37:33,312
That's just acknowledging this fact, the fact that what we are doing is about beauty,

524
00:37:33,933 --> 00:37:37,737
even when it is the beauty of logic and math, among other things.

525
00:37:38,919 --> 00:37:42,924
And that we recognize the importance of all those qualities on the right side of the slide,

526
00:37:42,964 --> 00:37:44,025
and we want more of them.

527
00:37:45,905 --> 00:37:51,087
This is a picture of Mewtwo King, who's one of the best Smash Bros. players in the world.

528
00:37:52,787 --> 00:37:57,509
This is a shot from the documentary, The Smash Bros., which you should see if you haven't seen it.

529
00:37:57,949 --> 00:37:58,569
It's on YouTube.

530
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:02,670
Maybe one of the best films about a game ever made.

531
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:04,931
The Smash Bros. on YouTube.

532
00:38:06,931 --> 00:38:10,052
One more example of the tension between bridge building and opera composing.

533
00:38:11,292 --> 00:38:14,273
The story of progress that we tell ourselves about video games.

534
00:38:14,987 --> 00:38:19,912
that they are evolving kind of the way technology evolves or the way science evolves.

535
00:38:20,713 --> 00:38:22,235
I'm guilty of telling this story myself.

536
00:38:23,376 --> 00:38:25,638
What are the unsolved problems of game design?

537
00:38:25,979 --> 00:38:27,320
What experiments should we run?

538
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,523
What new knowledge can we gain to move us incrementally forward?

539
00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:37,813
This is a picture of David Hilbert, the mathematician, who in 1900 introduced this list of unsolved

540
00:38:37,853 --> 00:38:41,836
problems that really set the course of mathematical research in the 20th century.

541
00:38:42,636 --> 00:38:43,937
And he's a romantic figure for me.

542
00:38:44,037 --> 00:38:48,500
I would love to be able to stand up here and say, you know, here's my vision for the 23

543
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,062
most important unsolved problems in game design.

544
00:38:51,942 --> 00:38:56,186
And obviously there's a lot of value in this approach of problems and progress,

545
00:38:56,586 --> 00:39:00,129
but there's also a sense in which this way of framing games again

546
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:04,673
misses the elusive and messy and chaotic way that aesthetics operates.

547
00:39:05,894 --> 00:39:08,937
Sure, there are some aspects of art forms that develop over time,

548
00:39:09,277 --> 00:39:11,819
techniques that are discovered and perfected and adopted,

549
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,723
but there are many more ways in which art forms don't develop that way.

550
00:39:16,764 --> 00:39:18,425
Cave paintings can still move us.

551
00:39:19,919 --> 00:39:24,288
Keats can look at a vase from 2,000 years ago, from 2,000 years before he was born,

552
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:26,493
and find beauty and meaning in it.

553
00:39:29,592 --> 00:39:35,318
In some ways, we are inheriting the legacy of 20th century modernism, which was itself,

554
00:39:35,378 --> 00:39:40,944
I think, kind of bedazzled by science, the science that it saw so successfully transforming

555
00:39:40,984 --> 00:39:41,564
the world around it.

556
00:39:41,584 --> 00:39:42,906
It wanted a piece of that.

557
00:39:43,286 --> 00:39:46,530
And so I think it framed aesthetics in scientific terms.

558
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:50,914
Experiments, breakthroughs, discoveries, and unsolved problems.

559
00:39:52,215 --> 00:39:56,778
And this approach is even more seductive for us because of how much science and engineering

560
00:39:56,798 --> 00:39:59,921
there is in games, both in their creation and in their play.

561
00:40:00,721 --> 00:40:02,222
But I think we need to be careful of this approach.

562
00:40:03,283 --> 00:40:06,566
Art is not a series of engineering problems, and neither is games.

563
00:40:07,586 --> 00:40:12,010
The destiny of games is not to evolve the way that technology evolves, but to evolve

564
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:17,614
alongside technology, as a counterpoint, a partner, a kind of dark companion.

565
00:40:20,531 --> 00:40:23,093
This is how games are in a position to overcome the two cultures problem.

566
00:40:23,753 --> 00:40:26,535
The gap between Whitman people and Feynman people.

567
00:40:27,435 --> 00:40:30,677
This isn't just a conflict between the sciences and the humanities.

568
00:40:31,718 --> 00:40:34,039
We don't just work in an industry that is defined by this tension.

569
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:37,722
We live in a world that is defined by this tension.

570
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:43,045
We live in a world that has been utterly transformed by instrumental reason.

571
00:40:44,006 --> 00:40:44,726
The Enlightenment.

572
00:40:45,467 --> 00:40:46,607
The Industrial Revolution.

573
00:40:47,448 --> 00:40:47,808
Science.

574
00:40:48,918 --> 00:40:50,859
These things have taken us into new territory.

575
00:40:51,919 --> 00:40:56,061
The power of rational thought is undeniable, but so are its costs.

576
00:40:57,761 --> 00:41:02,023
Our world is shot through with the trade-offs we make in order to access this power.

577
00:41:03,003 --> 00:41:08,205
Not just the obvious ones, like the looming danger of nuclear or environmental apocalypse,

578
00:41:09,126 --> 00:41:14,768
but the psychic trade-offs of living in a world where in many ways the rug has been

579
00:41:14,788 --> 00:41:15,648
pulled out from under us.

580
00:41:17,521 --> 00:41:23,283
We used to live lives that were grounded in a deep, organic, intuitive, emotional sense

581
00:41:23,363 --> 00:41:27,104
of connection to nature, to tradition, to society.

582
00:41:27,524 --> 00:41:28,624
It wasn't necessarily good.

583
00:41:28,644 --> 00:41:33,225
In fact, it was often horrific, but it had a lot of good things about it.

584
00:41:34,086 --> 00:41:35,406
And a lot of those things are missing.

585
00:41:36,186 --> 00:41:38,667
We no longer feel like we're a part of the natural world.

586
00:41:39,067 --> 00:41:43,248
We feel like we're outside of it, studying it, inspecting it, manipulating it.

587
00:41:45,259 --> 00:41:50,223
We no longer feel like we're in a well-defined and comfortable position within a social hierarchy.

588
00:41:50,484 --> 00:41:56,709
We also feel like we're in a tumultuous and upended and constantly changing social environment

589
00:41:56,749 --> 00:41:57,029
as well.

590
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:03,614
And all of the comfort and security that comes from relying on the deep knowledge of tradition

591
00:42:03,715 --> 00:42:09,780
and instinct, unquestioned, all of that has been replaced by a tumultuous upheaval in

592
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,221
which everything is up for grabs.

593
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,261
All that is solid melts into air, as Marx put it.

594
00:42:16,322 --> 00:42:22,683
Everything is subject to doubt, Feynman's doubt, the doubt of Feynman's father, the

595
00:42:22,703 --> 00:42:23,744
doubt of the scientist.

596
00:42:24,804 --> 00:42:30,446
Nothing is sacred, nothing is off limits, safe from being scrutinized by instrumental

597
00:42:30,486 --> 00:42:36,167
reason, explained, disenchanted, dismantled, reassembled into something new and strange

598
00:42:36,427 --> 00:42:38,848
that doesn't even feel like it quite belongs to us.

599
00:42:40,989 --> 00:42:41,829
But it does belong to us.

600
00:42:43,165 --> 00:42:47,969
this struggle to harness the power of instrumental reason, to understand its power and limits,

601
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:50,912
to guide it, this is our struggle.

602
00:42:52,234 --> 00:42:53,815
We aren't going to be able to go around it.

603
00:42:54,996 --> 00:42:55,897
We have to go through it.

604
00:42:57,579 --> 00:43:03,244
Every big problem in the world today is a mixture of, on the one hand, the empirical,

605
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:07,749
the factual, the logistical, and on the other, values.

606
00:43:09,203 --> 00:43:14,627
Every important problem is a blend of engineering problems, math problems, and values problems.

607
00:43:14,947 --> 00:43:19,990
Instrumental reason is really good at solving engineering problems, but it can't help us

608
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:20,931
with values problems.

609
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:22,812
The scientific method...

610
00:43:23,932 --> 00:43:29,956
doesn't tell us why the world is decomposable into coherent units subject to consistent

611
00:43:30,016 --> 00:43:36,941
laws. It just tells us that if we act as if it were that way, then we can fly through

612
00:43:36,961 --> 00:43:44,247
the air like birds and walk around on the moon and save little babies from dying. It

613
00:43:44,267 --> 00:43:49,931
doesn't tell us how we should use this power, where we should go with it, or honestly whether

614
00:43:49,971 --> 00:43:52,753
we should use it at all. This is a higher order problem.

615
00:43:54,162 --> 00:43:59,226
And this is a very important problem, especially if like me, you see the Enlightenment project

616
00:43:59,546 --> 00:44:06,111
as something profound and worthwhile, an important positive direction for humanity, something

617
00:44:06,151 --> 00:44:10,975
that is still underway, and something whose success is not a foregone conclusion, a project

618
00:44:10,995 --> 00:44:16,359
that could fail in all kinds of terrible ways, and therefore a project worth understanding,

619
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,981
critiquing, and getting right.

620
00:44:20,537 --> 00:44:24,365
After all, whatever your opinion is about flying through the air like a bird, or walking

621
00:44:24,405 --> 00:44:29,115
around on the moon, it's hard to argue with preventing babies from dying.

622
00:44:29,496 --> 00:44:31,059
That's a pretty strong trump card.

623
00:44:33,243 --> 00:44:36,504
Art is a window into these kinds of problems.

624
00:44:37,244 --> 00:44:41,145
Problems where we have to communally bootstrap ourselves into shared values.

625
00:44:41,785 --> 00:44:46,927
And games are the art form with the most to tell us about this particular problem.

626
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:49,587
Games are the art form of instrumental reason.

627
00:44:49,847 --> 00:44:55,489
Games are where we put down our slide rules for a moment, where we put down our computers

628
00:44:55,829 --> 00:45:01,530
and hammers and rocket ships, our amazing math and our glorious opposable thumbs in

629
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:02,810
order to examine them.

630
00:45:03,691 --> 00:45:10,136
reflect on them, enjoy them for their own sake, wonder about them, argue about them,

631
00:45:11,037 --> 00:45:14,560
ask what about them is beautiful and what about them is ugly.

632
00:45:17,062 --> 00:45:20,625
As game designers, it's our responsibility to think about this stuff.

633
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:25,469
We should be proud of this responsibility and a little scared about it.

634
00:45:27,149 --> 00:45:34,994
Our art form could lead to new ways of thinking through the central dilemmas of the modern

635
00:45:35,034 --> 00:45:35,315
world.

636
00:45:36,796 --> 00:45:42,560
This doesn't tell us what kind of games to make, but it does remind us to avoid simplifications

637
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,982
and respect the complexity of the challenge.

638
00:45:46,943 --> 00:45:53,588
We are a new kind of scientists who are also athletes and artists, and we should think

639
00:45:53,628 --> 00:45:53,788
about

640
00:45:55,135 --> 00:45:59,638
how what we do fits into this bigger picture of a possible world where something like that

641
00:45:59,718 --> 00:46:04,201
makes sense, where the power of instrumental reason unfolds in harmony with the beauty

642
00:46:04,222 --> 00:46:04,922
of shared values.

643
00:46:04,942 --> 00:46:07,124
Yeah, I know, it's a romantic picture.

644
00:46:07,824 --> 00:46:09,085
But romantic pictures have a place.

645
00:46:10,746 --> 00:46:15,510
Before Bennett Foddy joined me at NYU, he was at Oxford, down the hall from this guy,

646
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:17,511
the great contemporary philosopher Derek Parfitt.

647
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:25,766
Parfit's project is to build a system of morality outside the context of metaphysics,

648
00:46:26,287 --> 00:46:29,130
one that doesn't rely on transcendental religious ideas.

649
00:46:30,291 --> 00:46:34,696
This is, in its bigger, more serious way, a kind of co-op of the human soul.

650
00:46:36,023 --> 00:46:39,984
In a world where we no longer have the certainty of big religious truths,

651
00:46:40,284 --> 00:46:45,226
where all we have is our doubts, our intuitions, trial and error, thought and action,

652
00:46:45,586 --> 00:46:48,887
the modest work-a-day tools of boring empiricism,

653
00:46:49,627 --> 00:46:53,188
can we rebuild a new understanding of where we are going and how to get there?

654
00:46:53,768 --> 00:46:55,268
Can we relearn how to walk?

655
00:46:55,809 --> 00:46:56,769
If you read Parfit,

656
00:46:57,737 --> 00:46:59,859
It really is like watching someone play co-op.

657
00:46:59,899 --> 00:47:07,987
It's a series of tentative steps, slow, awkward, swaying back and forth, deliberate, self-conscious,

658
00:47:08,527 --> 00:47:15,854
taking nothing for granted, but slowly finding a rhythm, moving forward step by ridiculous

659
00:47:15,894 --> 00:47:16,154
step.

660
00:47:16,975 --> 00:47:19,177
And I can't think of a more important project in the world.

661
00:47:29,328 --> 00:47:29,628
Thank you.

662
00:47:30,991 --> 00:47:31,151
Thanks.

663
00:47:31,171 --> 00:47:31,292
Thanks.

664
00:47:31,312 --> 00:47:34,177
Thanks.

665
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:36,040
Thanks.

666
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:36,361
Thanks.

667
00:47:36,381 --> 00:47:38,585
Thanks.

668
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:38,765
Thanks.

669
00:47:38,786 --> 00:47:39,767
I think we have...

670
00:47:39,787 --> 00:47:40,569
Thank you.

671
00:47:40,589 --> 00:47:40,849
Thanks.

672
00:47:44,617 --> 00:47:49,399
I think there's time for some questions, if there are any questions.

673
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:54,180
I would love to converse, I believe, in dialogue.

674
00:47:54,200 --> 00:48:00,102
I just stood up here and gave a long speech, so I would love nothing more than to answer

675
00:48:00,122 --> 00:48:01,142
any questions if there are any.

676
00:48:01,903 --> 00:48:04,023
There don't have to be questions, but there are always questions, right?

677
00:48:05,244 --> 00:48:06,024
What is a life well lived?

678
00:48:06,044 --> 00:48:06,544
Yes, please.

679
00:48:07,864 --> 00:48:08,625
Sure, hit the mic.

680
00:48:13,938 --> 00:48:15,139
Awesome talk, thank you.

681
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:15,759
That was great.

682
00:48:15,779 --> 00:48:16,179
Thanks.

683
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:20,321
I just, I wanted to know what your opinion is on,

684
00:48:20,822 --> 00:48:23,323
I'm new to gaming and a lot of what I've encountered

685
00:48:23,503 --> 00:48:26,705
is this idea of very difficult individuals

686
00:48:27,746 --> 00:48:30,007
demanding to be left alone inside their medium.

687
00:48:30,027 --> 00:48:31,208
It's like, I'm a gamer.

688
00:48:31,588 --> 00:48:32,448
This is a thing I do.

689
00:48:32,708 --> 00:48:36,190
Asperger's, all kinds of things and barriers that we put up

690
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:38,712
and I think that limits the conversation with.

691
00:48:39,312 --> 00:48:39,452
Yeah.

692
00:48:40,389 --> 00:48:41,010
with the rest.

693
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:46,100
Yeah, I mean, I think, without a doubt, one of the main problems with games is that it

694
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:48,985
is weirdly isolated from the rest of the world.

695
00:48:49,227 --> 00:48:54,051
the world in a way. Sometimes it's cut off in its own little hermetic environment,

696
00:48:54,071 --> 00:48:59,897
its own little nation with its own customs. And I think it's an important project to try to find

697
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:06,203
points of connection with the rest of the world, ways of resonating with the rest of the world,

698
00:49:06,263 --> 00:49:13,210
with other kinds of art and design and culture, with important

699
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:19,533
themes and issues that were, you know, political issues or big ideas that we're struggling with.

700
00:49:21,213 --> 00:49:33,098
I think that's important. And it's something that I'm a big fan of. So, yeah. Yes.

701
00:49:34,193 --> 00:49:41,302
Wonderful talk. Frankly, just completely worth it, even for that simple story about the dating.

702
00:49:41,883 --> 00:49:44,306
That's just, I'm going to quote that many times.

703
00:49:45,007 --> 00:49:48,191
One of the things, though, that hit me that I'm curious about your opinion about is...

704
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:58,897
the dichotomy that you see, one of the areas where you brought into relief how I feel about serious games sometimes,

705
00:49:59,077 --> 00:50:09,422
because a game that was meant for pure play, and in the sense you describe, that is suddenly applied as like a brain training game,

706
00:50:09,862 --> 00:50:11,763
sometimes it can suck all the fun out of it.

707
00:50:12,364 --> 00:50:19,970
But conversely, sometimes a game that I feel guilty about playing because I know there's nothing more to explore, I'm not really getting that joy,

708
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:26,916
but it keeps me busy while I'm on the exercise bike and I feel good that it's helping me with a physical problem.

709
00:50:26,936 --> 00:50:33,802
It seems like there's some interesting extra layer that comes on when you consider serious games that's very fundamental.

710
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:34,242
So I think that...

711
00:50:37,505 --> 00:50:44,950
my approach, so this framework for thinking about games is the aesthetics of Israel Reason, sort of explains why I

712
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:52,715
am uncomfortable with serious games. It's another way of getting at that problem of serious games because to me serious games are

713
00:50:56,013 --> 00:51:01,655
they're like a double abstraction, right?

714
00:51:01,675 --> 00:51:10,597
Because in games, we sort of experience tool use for its own sake.

715
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:14,097
So we take the pliers and we just swing the pliers around,

716
00:51:14,497 --> 00:51:21,139
or we figure out how many nuts could I possibly attach in one minute, exactly.

717
00:51:21,939 --> 00:51:24,340
because of that we like invent new kinds of pliers just

718
00:51:24,861 --> 00:51:28,062
but we're not like if you then are doing that in order to build a ship

719
00:51:28,623 --> 00:51:30,704
then it's you're missing like

720
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:33,325
like that just doesn't work right because

721
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:35,726
the essence of what you're doing is that it's

722
00:51:36,087 --> 00:51:36,807
it's a kind of

723
00:51:37,447 --> 00:51:39,208
you're taking something that actually has a

724
00:51:39,268 --> 00:51:40,489
a function and use

725
00:51:40,789 --> 00:51:42,590
right the ability to think and solve problems

726
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:43,811
and do things

727
00:51:44,491 --> 00:51:48,073
uh... and you're kind of like carving out a little space where you do it

728
00:51:48,353 --> 00:51:49,694
for its own sake which is just kind of a

729
00:51:50,054 --> 00:51:50,974
it's kind of madness

730
00:51:51,535 --> 00:51:59,519
is ridiculous, then you can't then try to apply that itself as a deliberate tool.

731
00:51:59,559 --> 00:52:01,320
I think that's part of the problem.

732
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:08,164
I think that you have to just go into that crazy mad realm and then you come out of it.

733
00:52:08,664 --> 00:52:09,945
And hopefully you've...

734
00:52:10,485 --> 00:52:14,087
you've become like, your life has been enriched in some ways.

735
00:52:14,467 --> 00:52:17,969
Whether you become a better shipbuilder or whatever, like,

736
00:52:18,489 --> 00:52:21,910
but you can't, yeah, I don't think you can,

737
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:24,131
I think you drain out everything that's important

738
00:52:24,732 --> 00:52:29,274
if you try to take the, you know, the plier game

739
00:52:30,014 --> 00:52:31,434
and build an actual ship with it.

740
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:39,761
to put it in specific terms, then if someone were simply playing civilization and as part

741
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:45,145
of that process learned something about the process of history, that's the proper way

742
00:52:45,365 --> 00:52:50,088
if you go to a class and they try and teach it through civilization and kind of suck all

743
00:52:50,128 --> 00:52:55,272
of the enjoyment and abstraction out of the game and throw into relief all the game-like

744
00:52:55,332 --> 00:52:57,194
things of Abraham Lincoln living for 4,000 years.

745
00:52:57,254 --> 00:52:57,574
Yeah.

746
00:52:57,594 --> 00:52:57,874
Yeah.

747
00:52:57,894 --> 00:52:58,675
Okay.

748
00:52:59,115 --> 00:52:59,876
Yeah, exactly.

749
00:52:59,896 --> 00:53:00,076
Thank you.

750
00:53:00,156 --> 00:53:03,941
and it's no question that you can use games like that just in the same way that you can use music

751
00:53:04,362 --> 00:53:07,706
to memorize the alphabet. We all do it, there's nothing wrong with it

752
00:53:08,487 --> 00:53:11,051
but it's not the main thing that we like about music.

753
00:53:11,852 --> 00:53:12,072
Right?

754
00:53:13,783 --> 00:53:13,964
Yeah.

755
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:17,125
Thank you so much for such a transcendent talk, Frank.

756
00:53:17,445 --> 00:53:18,906
Thanks, thank you.

757
00:53:18,926 --> 00:53:22,128
So I had kind of noticed this year at GDC

758
00:53:22,188 --> 00:53:24,429
some kind of theme emerging around sort of

759
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:28,011
embodied play and sort of performance.

760
00:53:28,491 --> 00:53:31,233
And I loved all of your great examples.

761
00:53:31,273 --> 00:53:32,693
They seem to focus quite a lot on

762
00:53:32,874 --> 00:53:34,434
more highly structured play.

763
00:53:35,695 --> 00:53:37,536
Do you have any thoughts about particular

764
00:53:38,356 --> 00:53:40,978
avenues of interest for maybe less structured,

765
00:53:41,058 --> 00:53:43,059
more open kinds of play that would?

766
00:53:43,759 --> 00:53:56,805
Yeah, I mean, I guess in some ways, this whole thing is my attempt to celebrate this other

767
00:53:56,845 --> 00:54:01,186
form of play and explain what I find profound and meaningful about it.

768
00:54:02,167 --> 00:54:05,668
But it's in no way meant to exclude other kinds of play.

769
00:54:07,209 --> 00:54:10,890
In some ways, this is a response to people like David Kanaga and Miguel Sicard.

770
00:54:12,531 --> 00:54:19,114
Doug Wilson and these other people who I think are putting forward a really articulate and powerful

771
00:54:20,314 --> 00:54:26,477
celebration of a kind of critique of this other kind of more structured play.

772
00:54:27,117 --> 00:54:35,200
And I just want both, right? I don't want... and I think that most of the time those people are...

773
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:39,442
are open-minded and they're saying,

774
00:54:39,462 --> 00:54:40,603
oh listen, that stuff is good too,

775
00:54:40,863 --> 00:54:42,545
but secretly I don't think they think it's good,

776
00:54:42,565 --> 00:54:43,545
I think they think it's bad.

777
00:54:43,565 --> 00:54:45,127
I think the Tale of Tales people,

778
00:54:45,147 --> 00:54:47,669
one of the things I love about them so much

779
00:54:47,949 --> 00:54:49,210
is how honest they are about like,

780
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:51,471
no, that's actually bad, you know?

781
00:54:51,551 --> 00:54:54,013
It's like bad, and I guess what I'm saying is that

782
00:54:54,394 --> 00:54:58,056
it's not, but it's forcing me to try to figure out

783
00:54:58,177 --> 00:54:59,377
why it's not bad.

784
00:55:00,058 --> 00:55:03,499
And this is one answer. And not only is it not bad, but it's like,

785
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:07,321
not bad in a way that I want to share with them. I want them... I want to convince them.

786
00:55:07,821 --> 00:55:09,022
It's not enough for me to say,

787
00:55:09,042 --> 00:55:11,323
oh, well you play your games and I'll play mine.

788
00:55:11,343 --> 00:55:15,945
I want to be playing games with them, and I want to play their games, and I...

789
00:55:16,305 --> 00:55:17,926
but I also want them to understand

790
00:55:19,767 --> 00:55:20,827
that there is a...

791
00:55:21,587 --> 00:55:22,148
there's something that...

792
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:29,441
there's a shared values, you know what I mean? I want to reinforce the things that I think that

793
00:55:29,581 --> 00:55:32,405
where we could agree about these other kinds of games and kind of

794
00:55:33,046 --> 00:55:33,346
maybe

795
00:55:34,027 --> 00:55:35,929
you know, rescue them from that critique.

796
00:55:37,732 --> 00:55:38,152
Thank you.

797
00:55:41,814 --> 00:55:42,736
Yes, let me go this way.

798
00:55:42,816 --> 00:55:48,985
Yeah, so, um, yeah, I was really interested by, um, your talk, um, but, um, at the same

799
00:55:49,005 --> 00:55:51,990
time it sort of reminds me of a lot of experiences I've had.

800
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:54,253
I've done, uh, serious games and also, um...

801
00:55:54,933 --> 00:55:58,999
sort of been an observer of sort of the trends in sort of, you know, sort of artistic games

802
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:01,923
and things exploring the sort of aesthetic space you're describing there.

803
00:56:02,463 --> 00:56:07,710
And one thing I see as sort of a tension, I guess, between these attempts to push more

804
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:12,717
of sort of an aesthetic sort of sensibilities into games, is that you end up...

805
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:18,534
with both on the developer side and the player side, sort of people that fall into two camps.

806
00:56:18,655 --> 00:56:23,119
People that sort of hear things like what you're saying and either fully embrace them,

807
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:27,324
they really like it, so they end up sort of going in a direction where they try to make

808
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:30,808
games that either maybe convert people who don't normally play games into...

809
00:56:31,569 --> 00:56:37,895
playing games or make something that's unconventional that while is admirable in its pursuit, maybe

810
00:56:38,256 --> 00:56:42,740
doesn't quite fly with, you know, traditional gamers. And then on the other side you have

811
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:47,845
people that totally reject it that think, oh, this is just all platitudes and just high

812
00:56:47,845 --> 00:56:52,610
falutin talk and just sort of reject it and just go back to making, you know, just mindless

813
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:54,232
shooters and stuff. And I feel like, um...

814
00:56:55,673 --> 00:56:55,853
I'm

815
00:56:56,774 --> 00:57:01,858
For me, I think it would be I feel like there's a lot more. We need a lot more effort to try to

816
00:57:02,579 --> 00:57:08,904
Blend those more to try to find some add more substance to our traditional games and add more

817
00:57:09,184 --> 00:57:15,229
Yeah, this is this is in no way meant to be like an admonition to make certain kinds of games or not

818
00:57:15,269 --> 00:57:19,413
Make other kinds of games. I think people should make the game that they want to make make the game. They want to play

819
00:57:21,034 --> 00:57:21,234
and

820
00:57:22,015 --> 00:57:23,956
so yeah, it's more just maybe a

821
00:57:25,037 --> 00:57:26,758
an attempt to kind of like hint at

822
00:57:28,059 --> 00:57:31,061
what's going on here and and what what we could like

823
00:57:31,401 --> 00:57:31,922
look for

824
00:57:32,422 --> 00:57:36,404
you know as as part of the the purpose and meaning or the in a larger sense

825
00:57:37,125 --> 00:57:38,386
uh... behind what what

826
00:57:39,186 --> 00:57:41,888
whatever both of these kinds of games that are being made all of these different kinds of games

827
00:57:42,868 --> 00:57:44,810
uh... I think we have time for one more one more question

828
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:45,730
one more question

829
00:57:46,771 --> 00:57:49,172
alright hi uh... very inspiring talk thank you thank you

830
00:57:49,753 --> 00:57:50,193
uh... but

831
00:57:51,437 --> 00:57:53,918
With gaming, I feel becoming more ubiquitous now.

832
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:57,880
With the advent of mobile gaming being very accessible,

833
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,341
you're seeing game development schools popping up,

834
00:58:01,421 --> 00:58:05,483
the rise of e-sports and similar avenues of popularizing games

835
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:06,403
and just how we feel.

836
00:58:06,423 --> 00:58:09,704
A lot of the stuff really speaks to us within these halls.

837
00:58:09,984 --> 00:58:10,985
We're all game developers.

838
00:58:11,725 --> 00:58:13,846
But do you feel that this is almost,

839
00:58:14,406 --> 00:58:16,847
we're starting to see a sort of a renaissance where gamings are

840
00:58:17,247 --> 00:58:23,168
gaming is becoming accepted as an art form and that this kind of a talk would resonate with

841
00:58:23,648 --> 00:58:28,929
people outside of, you know, our circles. I hope so. Yes, I hope so. That would be my hope. I would love for

842
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:33,810
to reach a broader audience and have this larger conversation about

843
00:58:34,631 --> 00:58:41,072
what's going on with games and why there's more happening there than maybe it looks and how this could

844
00:58:43,172 --> 00:58:46,073
you know, I don't know maybe I would love for there to be

845
00:58:47,253 --> 00:58:55,259
For us as game developers to own this thing that we're doing we're changing the world and step our step up our game

846
00:58:55,839 --> 00:59:01,803
Be like become public intellectuals. I think there's you know what I mean like have an opportunity like to bring this idea that

847
00:59:02,484 --> 00:59:06,146
Living with games making them and playing them should make us

848
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:14,334
smart, good, interesting people. And let's, you know, exhibit that in the way that we

849
00:59:15,054 --> 00:59:19,336
talk to the rest of the world and carry ourselves in the rest of the world. And this is kind of my

850
00:59:20,116 --> 00:59:23,037
battle cry to do that, right? To have a kind of

851
00:59:24,518 --> 00:59:26,399
seriousness with which we say, no, this is...

852
00:59:26,999 --> 00:59:28,881
Like the way filmmakers do, right?

853
00:59:28,921 --> 00:59:31,723
They understand the seriousness of what film is,

854
00:59:32,324 --> 00:59:36,487
the kind of global id of the 20th century, right?

855
00:59:36,507 --> 00:59:39,790
It is this, it's the shared imagination of the entire world

856
00:59:40,091 --> 00:59:41,312
and they take it seriously.

857
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:43,173
What is it that we're doing?

858
00:59:44,735 --> 00:59:46,336
And that's the question I want to ask

859
00:59:46,436 --> 00:59:47,637
and I want to just take that seriously.

860
00:59:47,677 --> 00:59:48,718
I want us all to take that seriously.

861
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:49,759
Yeah, thanks.
