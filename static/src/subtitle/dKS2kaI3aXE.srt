00:00:05,462 --> 00:00:08,404
Hello, this is the talk honoring the blade,

2
00:00:08,404 --> 00:00:11,145
lethality and combat balance in Ghost of Tsushima.

3
00:00:11,145 --> 00:00:15,047
This talk is going to talk a lot about how the Samurai fantasy impacted

4
00:00:15,047 --> 00:00:18,649
our design decisions and our combat balance throughout the game.

5
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:22,351
But before we go into that, talk a little bit about myself.

6
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:23,752
My name is Theodore Fishman. I go by Ted.

7
00:00:23,752 --> 00:00:26,893
I've been at Sucker Punch for 11 years.

8
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:30,055
I'm the lead combat designer there, and I've worked on systems

9
00:00:30,055 --> 00:00:31,716
and combat design all the way through.

10
00:00:31,716 --> 00:00:34,677
And of course, mostly on combat design on Ghost of Tsushima.

11
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:39,016
So before we get into the actual core design issues we ran into,

12
00:00:39,016 --> 00:00:42,718
it's important to talk about the samurai fantasy.

13
00:00:42,718 --> 00:00:46,339
Flash of steel, few quick strikes and the enemy is dead.

14
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:48,240
That is the fantasy of a samurai.

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,742
This is a trope instilled via samurai films, manga, anime, you name it.

16
00:00:53,742 --> 00:00:55,223
We had to fulfill this trope.

17
00:00:55,223 --> 00:00:58,244
But how does that translate into gameplay?

18
00:00:58,244 --> 00:01:01,765
How do you balance a combat for a grounded game,

19
00:01:01,765 --> 00:01:05,427
especially with character and player progression throughout the game?

20
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:10,341
where you can't have everything die too fast, but still feel lethal?

21
00:01:10,341 --> 00:01:12,483
That is the core we needed to succeed at.

22
00:01:12,483 --> 00:01:14,785
And we had features like standoffs,

23
00:01:14,785 --> 00:01:19,268
and nailed that feeling of lethality and honoring that trope and fantasy.

24
00:01:19,268 --> 00:01:24,372
But how combat is initiated was the main purpose of standoffs.

25
00:01:24,372 --> 00:01:27,174
That didn't really go into the standard combat loop.

26
00:01:27,174 --> 00:01:30,757
How do we bring this feeling of standoffs and match those expectations?

27
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,098
How do we honor the blade feeling lethal and sharp?

28
00:01:36,502 --> 00:01:38,924
So let's kind of break down the core design problem.

29
00:01:38,924 --> 00:01:46,111
We wanted satisfying player progression that included armor, charms, weapons, you name it.

30
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:49,214
And that had to be for 30 hours of gameplay.

31
00:01:49,214 --> 00:01:52,477
For an open world game, players could go wherever they wanted,

32
00:01:52,477 --> 00:01:55,700
they could go, you know, do content, whatever they wanted to.

33
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,682
So we need to have that be satisfying.

34
00:01:57,682 --> 00:01:57,742
And

35
00:01:58,315 --> 00:02:03,937
We had multiple difficulty modes, whether it be easy to hard and later lethal, which we added.

36
00:02:03,937 --> 00:02:08,400
We also had to support a 2-4 player co-op mode for Bronze and up to Raid tier difficulties.

37
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:18,985
Plus, we had a variety of enemies to keep players interested and escalate challenge and difficulty throughout those enemies and feel it through the progression of the game.

38
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:25,101
And we're also an action game, you know, it has to feel fast paced, it has to be responsive,

39
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:27,501
you know, how do we get players to understand what's happening and read,

40
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:31,343
you know, like, oh, that felt meaningful, that felt like there was an impact on my decisions

41
00:02:31,343 --> 00:02:36,224
and the choices I made for my builds, my armor, whatever it may be.

42
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:40,946
But the whole risk that's part of this is that things start to feel like sword sponges,

43
00:02:40,946 --> 00:02:45,067
that HP inflation could, you know, spiral out of control.

44
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:50,791
specifically because of like, oh, I need to challenge a player and then this sword upgrade doesn't feel meaningful.

45
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,011
That could be a huge issue.

46
00:02:52,011 --> 00:02:54,972
And this is one of the major issues we had to try to, you know, tackle.

47
00:02:54,972 --> 00:02:59,413
So we had to escalate those challenges, we tried things, right?

48
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:02,494
So the first one was like, you know, standard RPG leveling, right?

49
00:03:02,494 --> 00:03:08,795
Level differences, scale damage and damage to the player, damage to the enemy.

50
00:03:08,795 --> 00:03:13,137
And also, you know, we showed health bars and show how the big difference of each sword strike didn't matter.

51
00:03:13,885 --> 00:03:18,509
But this started to feel really gamey and frayed at the kind of realistic and grounded nature of our game.

52
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:22,493
And it also felt like your sword wasn't sharp.

53
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:31,821
And it only got kind of worse when we did the extreme case, you know, other RPGs do this, where you have skulls to show the difference between high and low hero to enemy levels.

54
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,264
It felt very artificial and we need to escalate in a different way.

55
00:03:37,264 --> 00:03:40,287
What was even worse was that you can do this in an open world scenario

56
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:43,249
pretty easily if you just kind of travel outside the boundaries.

57
00:03:43,249 --> 00:03:45,592
Originally, this was what we're looking for.

58
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:48,234
We're like, you know, you should do this mission and upgrade your armor

59
00:03:48,234 --> 00:03:49,695
and your sword.

60
00:03:49,695 --> 00:03:52,077
But this became kind of harmful to the fantasy.

61
00:03:52,077 --> 00:03:52,538
And we've tried to go.

62
00:03:59,187 --> 00:04:04,954
it, maybe literally, where we had a shield of HP around the like a low health of a

63
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:09,199
red health bar. So in this video we talk a little bit, show here a little bit

64
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:13,444
about like hey this orange barrier around the red health points keep them

65
00:04:13,444 --> 00:04:16,768
like you know three to four hits to kill the guy but if you could break through

66
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,329
the shield.

67
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,672
We had weapon scaling and like to go through, you know, armor faster,

68
00:04:21,672 --> 00:04:24,773
but it was really opaque and people had a hard time understanding

69
00:04:24,773 --> 00:04:26,073
what was going on there.

70
00:04:26,073 --> 00:04:28,854
And plus, even though it was done in other games, which is, you know,

71
00:04:28,854 --> 00:04:30,374
a totally fine way to approach it,

72
00:04:30,374 --> 00:04:34,156
it didn't feel like lethal or matching the fantasy we wanted for the samurai game.

73
00:04:34,156 --> 00:04:38,677
So we tried it on multiple different things,

74
00:04:38,677 --> 00:04:41,978
we did a lot of internal and external testing, and we wanted to see

75
00:04:41,978 --> 00:04:44,559
what do players think, did this match their expectations and.

76
00:04:45,145 --> 00:04:46,846
A lot of them was not what we wanted to hear.

77
00:04:46,846 --> 00:04:49,388
Like, oh, it felt like I was hanging with a foam bat.

78
00:04:49,388 --> 00:04:50,989
Is this a pool noodle?

79
00:04:50,989 --> 00:04:51,509
I don't know.

80
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:57,212
But the worst case is it really harmed the character fantasy we were going for.

81
00:04:57,212 --> 00:05:01,374
We wanted them to feel like a samurai, and this was not honoring that.

82
00:05:01,374 --> 00:05:05,437
So what could we do to really make sure we honor that?

83
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:08,578
A crisp idea, like what contract do we have with the player?

84
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:16,783
This lethality contract, you know, what does it mean to be a samurai?

85
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:21,627
And we talked about the standoffs being core to that feeling of the blade is sharp.

86
00:05:21,627 --> 00:05:23,508
How do we bring that to the rest of combat?

87
00:05:23,508 --> 00:05:26,931
As I was saying earlier, sword combat must be lethal.

88
00:05:26,931 --> 00:05:29,573
And there's other elements of combat, too.

89
00:05:29,573 --> 00:05:32,675
You know, when headshots and assassinations also had to kill

90
00:05:32,675 --> 00:05:35,157
and made sense to the players, like, oh, if I use an arrow

91
00:05:35,157 --> 00:05:37,159
and hit them in the head, they should die.

92
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:41,102
We had to be a lot more cognizant of what it meant to players' expectations

93
00:05:41,102 --> 00:05:41,822
of this fantasy.

94
00:05:42,757 --> 00:05:46,438
And so we had to be a lot more harder on our limits of our HP,

95
00:05:46,438 --> 00:05:51,200
you know, number of hits to kill without upgrades had to be within a shorter band.

96
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,862
And even for our difficulty scaling, we can say, no, no, no, we need to keep it lower.

97
00:05:55,862 --> 00:05:58,704
We need to keep it so that doesn't inflate even on hard, et cetera.

98
00:05:58,704 --> 00:05:59,404
There are other ways to do this,

99
00:05:59,404 --> 00:06:02,325
which I'll talk about in a minute.

100
00:06:03,802 --> 00:06:05,144
And there's no RPG enemy levels.

101
00:06:05,144 --> 00:06:09,950
Part of this was HP inflation, but most of it was just harming the reality

102
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:14,376
of the game, like we've been we were presenting this as a grounded samurai game.

103
00:06:14,376 --> 00:06:15,758
Those RPG levels just didn't fit.

104
00:06:17,282 --> 00:06:18,502
And that sounds great.

105
00:06:18,502 --> 00:06:20,924
You know, OK, I'll just strip it all away. No problem. Right.

106
00:06:20,924 --> 00:06:24,225
Now, we need to have some way to provide challenge and escalation.

107
00:06:24,225 --> 00:06:26,767
Have your, you know, armor and swords feel meaningful.

108
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:29,868
If they didn't, you know, how do we how do we make sure the players

109
00:06:29,868 --> 00:06:32,670
keep engaged with, you know, reward loops or, you know,

110
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:35,271
the combat loop that we're trying to provide?

111
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:38,273
So, you know, we had to start reevaluating what we were doing and say,

112
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:42,435
well, maybe we need to push on other angles, specifically

113
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:45,377
talking about being more defensive for enemies to protect a low HP.

114
00:06:45,377 --> 00:06:46,738
We're pushing down the.

115
00:06:47,964 --> 00:06:52,286
number of hits to kill to like maybe four or five, maybe three in some cases.

116
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:55,649
But we need to have them to block and parry, you know, pretty standard stuff.

117
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,851
But we just had we may have gone a little bit too far.

118
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:01,933
We tried to say, OK, no, they have to be really on their toes

119
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:04,014
and have them block and parry the hero.

120
00:07:04,014 --> 00:07:05,115
And they're like, oh, no, no, no, no.

121
00:07:05,115 --> 00:07:06,376
It just was too far.

122
00:07:06,376 --> 00:07:10,298
It was too, too frustrating for players.

123
00:07:10,298 --> 00:07:12,260
But at the same time, though, you know, like.

124
00:07:17,105 --> 00:07:22,018
them, but it became the predominant strategy. We needed to have a way to have the players

125
00:07:22,018 --> 00:07:26,008
break through those defenses and still feel like a samurai in an awesome way.

126
00:07:30,353 --> 00:07:33,435
So pushing on going on the offensive was a big part of this.

127
00:07:33,435 --> 00:07:36,396
Like, you know, we added a stagger meter, a pretty standard portion of melee

128
00:07:36,396 --> 00:07:38,137
combat games nowadays.

129
00:07:38,137 --> 00:07:40,258
But we try to do it in a little bit different of a way.

130
00:07:40,258 --> 00:07:42,659
Not all attacks did stagger damage.

131
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:47,221
Light attacks were faster and heavy attacks did that stagger damage.

132
00:07:47,221 --> 00:07:49,022
But they also were the same amount.

133
00:07:49,022 --> 00:07:51,263
We didn't want one attack to be overly used to the other.

134
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:53,904
We're like, oh, you only heavy attack because it just does more damage.

135
00:07:54,614 --> 00:08:00,304
And it also really pushed us for helping an enemy variety, like that heavy shield guy in the upper right,

136
00:08:00,304 --> 00:08:04,011
like he could slow you down so other enemies would come in, like that spear on the upper left.

137
00:08:05,042 --> 00:08:09,326
is a huge element of our encounter design and how we actually got an enemy variety.

138
00:08:09,326 --> 00:08:13,150
It's like a speed of stagger can change how you approach these enemies,

139
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,152
especially with the speed of heavy attacks.

140
00:08:15,152 --> 00:08:18,475
But it also lets us start to expand what other things a player could do.

141
00:08:18,475 --> 00:08:23,159
And that led us to open the door to stances.

142
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:27,603
If those who know how our stance system works, essentially you match.

143
00:08:28,164 --> 00:08:29,785
a stance to a specific enemy type.

144
00:08:29,785 --> 00:08:35,227
So that shieldman in the upper right, you use shield stance or water stance for our game.

145
00:08:35,227 --> 00:08:40,309
And it, you know, breaks through to the defenses faster, but not additional damage.

146
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:45,692
As I said before, because speed of stagger was a huge element of our encounter composition and design,

147
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:50,113
enemy aggression and how fast people attack, if you could break them faster, that was a huge deal.

148
00:08:51,151 --> 00:08:53,833
And to be clear, this is not a hard solve.

149
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,054
You know, unaligned attacks would get reversed or dodged,

150
00:08:56,054 --> 00:09:00,056
but it wasn't the only... you didn't have to do it.

151
00:09:00,056 --> 00:09:01,837
However, it was on Fantasy and on-brand.

152
00:09:01,837 --> 00:09:05,599
It felt really cool to break through an enemy's defense using the right stance.

153
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:08,321
And it was definitely part of that Samurai Fantasy stances.

154
00:09:08,321 --> 00:09:10,662
But the reason not to make it a hard solve is...

155
00:09:12,745 --> 00:09:16,627
completely different order, they may not have the stance or they're like you know

156
00:09:16,627 --> 00:09:19,369
maybe they're not skilled enough, whatever it may be, it's okay not to

157
00:09:19,369 --> 00:09:22,471
require it. They could get around it and they still felt smart and like

158
00:09:22,471 --> 00:09:27,715
got around his defenses and still killed him. That being said, this is a great

159
00:09:27,715 --> 00:09:31,878
baseline. We had to go from, expand from here. We had to escalate challenge for

160
00:09:31,878 --> 00:09:34,139
the enemies. How are we gonna do that?

161
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:34,399
Well

162
00:09:39,022 --> 00:09:41,904
A lot of it was actually mirroring, like mirroring the lethality of the hero,

163
00:09:41,904 --> 00:09:44,426
you know, less hits to kill to the other direction.

164
00:09:44,426 --> 00:09:46,328
Enemies have to start to be more lethal.

165
00:09:46,328 --> 00:09:49,930
And we had an injective variety, as I said earlier on the first slides.

166
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:53,013
You know, weapon usage, as I just said, and counter composition

167
00:09:53,013 --> 00:09:55,695
played into that, that includes their aggression, their speed

168
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,397
and what movesets have to challenge them with new types of attacks,

169
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:01,039
including the unblockable and parable attacks.

170
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,900
But also, of course, increased enemy damage.

171
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,603
That's that lethality I'm referring to where they push back on you.

172
00:10:08,907 --> 00:10:12,129
But at the same time, we still had to increase HP, but carefully.

173
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:14,991
You know, we had to have sword upgrades feel meaningful.

174
00:10:14,991 --> 00:10:16,993
And a lot of that came down also to character art,

175
00:10:16,993 --> 00:10:19,895
where you could see the difference, like, oh, he's more armored.

176
00:10:19,895 --> 00:10:21,376
That justifies it some more.

177
00:10:21,376 --> 00:10:23,698
But that doesn't mean we went out of control like a huge amount.

178
00:10:23,698 --> 00:10:25,319
We had to really be mindful of this.

179
00:10:26,372 --> 00:10:31,400
So a good example of those, the worst case scenario is you can encounter the far right guy before any upgrades.

180
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:38,390
This is the worst case scenario. We still would have like maybe 10 to 12 hits to kill on that guy. That could be bad.

181
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:41,455
But we had some other mechanisms in our world that actually really helped us out.

182
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,402
So in our actual world, we actually broke it down into kind of like prefectures.

183
00:10:47,402 --> 00:10:49,824
Each area had a different tier of enemies.

184
00:10:49,824 --> 00:10:52,185
So you can see on this map here all the different colors.

185
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:56,288
A little bit harder to look at a little bit, but the white areas are kind of like the intro

186
00:10:56,288 --> 00:11:01,411
enemies and then you have like the orange, blue, red and green as they escalate through the island.

187
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:05,934
And so you start down here in the lower portion of the island and it's actually blocked off

188
00:11:05,934 --> 00:11:07,255
to the upper part.

189
00:11:07,255 --> 00:11:10,217
There's a choke point right at the start at the tip of the blue part of the south.

190
00:11:10,632 --> 00:11:15,354
And that actually helped us say you can't encounter the green guys at the top.

191
00:11:15,354 --> 00:11:19,355
You have to, you know, get past that story checkpoint. You have to get some upgrades.

192
00:11:19,355 --> 00:11:25,217
So that mitigated the upper band it could get up into, which is what we're really trying to avoid.

193
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:28,378
And it also helped us a little bit with balance, trying to make sure that you didn't over level.

194
00:11:28,378 --> 00:11:32,500
I'll talk about that more. We didn't completely solve that, but it did help us kind of say,

195
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,540
oh yeah, this is as far as you could go for now.

196
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:34,580
So.

197
00:11:37,077 --> 00:11:40,762
With all that in mind, you know, like, what about, like, how do we present this information?

198
00:11:40,762 --> 00:11:43,967
How do we show number of hits to kill?

199
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:45,489
Now, we showed this earlier with the UI.

200
00:11:45,489 --> 00:11:49,375
There's a lot of layers in the early, obviously, debugging versions of this,

201
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,497
but it actually just really...

202
00:11:53,982 --> 00:12:00,005
less being more. A big portion of our art direction was minimal UI.

203
00:12:00,005 --> 00:12:03,506
And also it was into our benefit, the comment and speed for Ghost is actually

204
00:12:03,506 --> 00:12:07,767
pretty fast and a lot can happen and all this UI flying everywhere actually made

205
00:12:07,767 --> 00:12:11,289
it harder. Good news we got rid of the armor points which are in some of these

206
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:11,749
earlier ones.

207
00:12:12,289 --> 00:12:14,871
But we still need to show progress against other stuff.

208
00:12:14,871 --> 00:12:17,392
Like you can see the stagger bar, which is the purple in the upper left,

209
00:12:17,392 --> 00:12:19,593
got turned into this kind of arced bar.

210
00:12:19,593 --> 00:12:21,695
A little lighter weight, easier to see.

211
00:12:21,695 --> 00:12:23,135
We needed to show progress,

212
00:12:23,135 --> 00:12:25,017
but we also didn't really need to show hit points

213
00:12:25,017 --> 00:12:27,438
because those hits that killed were low.

214
00:12:27,438 --> 00:12:28,939
We have a low health indicator,

215
00:12:28,939 --> 00:12:31,680
but it was just there to say, oh, you're almost there.

216
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,161
That was huge and important to us

217
00:12:33,161 --> 00:12:36,183
to make sure that you still had showed progress for that,

218
00:12:36,183 --> 00:12:38,004
but we didn't need to have all that information.

219
00:12:38,522 --> 00:12:44,987
And surprisingly, players were more accepting of slightly more hits with less information.

220
00:12:44,987 --> 00:12:48,890
It's for like the lower band. So if you're like five or six hits, you might not need to show

221
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:53,634
anything. Of course, if you're higher, we might have to show something which I'll talk about in

222
00:12:53,634 --> 00:12:58,338
a bit. But essentially, we were kind of surprised that people were willing to accept more hits if

223
00:12:58,338 --> 00:13:01,480
there was less UI to show it, especially when it's lower hit points.

224
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:08,847
So this kind of gets into this interesting question of design by feel or like how do we

225
00:13:08,847 --> 00:13:13,710
data use data to confirm it. Well we have the kind of standard hits to kill chart a lot of games have

226
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:17,753
where it's like oh yeah this is the number of hits to kill a target based on these progression

227
00:13:17,753 --> 00:13:23,717
values. We needed to kind of see what our design sense was and what expectations players had and

228
00:13:23,717 --> 00:13:28,260
it's like okay well this is six hits to kill if you have these upgrades how does that feel

229
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,062
when we test that and so we kind of charted it all out.

230
00:13:31,495 --> 00:13:35,779
But it's also kind of interesting what the bans are, you know, we don't, players could, as I said

231
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:40,823
before, go anywhere they want in an open world game. They could, you know, complete some content,

232
00:13:40,823 --> 00:13:45,727
not others. How do we make it sure what is the acceptable range, if you will, between value?

233
00:13:45,727 --> 00:13:50,331
Is it four to six hits at this point in the game? Do they have certain charms and upgrades?

234
00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:52,653
These are all questions we all factored into our sheets.

235
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:57,314
including difficulty balancing, like to the hero, as I said earlier, for enemies,

236
00:13:57,314 --> 00:14:02,059
we increase damage on different difficulties, but we never increase their HP or their stagger values

237
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:07,907
because stagger had similar implications to HP where if it was too high players would get frustrated

238
00:14:07,907 --> 00:14:09,669
and like, oh this guy just feels like a wall.

239
00:14:10,314 --> 00:14:11,775
But we can push all the other angles,

240
00:14:11,775 --> 00:14:14,358
so I said damage output, aggression,

241
00:14:14,358 --> 00:14:17,480
moveset timing for parry and dodge, huge part of that.

242
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,682
We charted those out in similar things

243
00:14:19,682 --> 00:14:21,043
where you number hits to kill the hero

244
00:14:21,043 --> 00:14:24,005
and matching those expectations for the higher difficulties.

245
00:14:24,005 --> 00:14:26,968
Talking about higher difficulties,

246
00:14:26,968 --> 00:14:30,491
we actually added another post-launch experiment

247
00:14:30,491 --> 00:14:32,953
initially called lethal difficulty.

248
00:14:32,953 --> 00:14:34,534
We really wanted to push something

249
00:14:34,534 --> 00:14:36,936
that was not just harder.

250
00:14:36,936 --> 00:14:39,798
It was something that felt maximally lethal.

251
00:14:41,878 --> 00:14:45,439
before of like, slash slash, someone's dead, or you could be dead instantly.

252
00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:50,280
It ended up being harder, and we, you know, we pushed a lot of the stuff to the extremes,

253
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,701
but you know, we actually increased the damage of the player to make sure that when you're

254
00:14:53,701 --> 00:14:59,683
taking so much, you can die in two hits, that they would also go down in one to two hits.

255
00:14:59,683 --> 00:15:00,823
That felt, felt right.

256
00:15:00,823 --> 00:15:04,484
We were trying to do something different, but it did narrow our progression band, and

257
00:15:04,484 --> 00:15:09,085
we're like, okay, we want to try this more kind of role-playing, more fantasy-fulfilling

258
00:15:09,085 --> 00:15:09,845
difficulty mode.

259
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:15,073
But it's OK if that progression player doesn't feel as impactful necessarily,

260
00:15:15,073 --> 00:15:19,095
because this was actually more successful than we thought it was going to be.

261
00:15:19,095 --> 00:15:20,595
You know, it hit the fantasy the way you want to.

262
00:15:20,595 --> 00:15:22,756
It felt like this untapped potential.

263
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:25,217
And people really started replaying portions of the content

264
00:15:25,217 --> 00:15:27,558
more than we expected in a really great way.

265
00:15:27,558 --> 00:15:30,180
And especially for the challenging encounters like our duels,

266
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,041
people are like, I want a no hit run and I want to make sure that I do it perfectly.

267
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,742
It was just so great to see the community engage with that

268
00:15:36,742 --> 00:15:39,163
and also be part of that, say, oh, yeah, this is what I expected.

269
00:15:41,183 --> 00:15:44,766
So with all those things in mind, like how do we confirm all those, you know,

270
00:15:44,766 --> 00:15:46,547
the difficulty modes, the hits to kill?

271
00:15:46,547 --> 00:15:50,731
How do we know we're in the right band, those ranges I talked about earlier?

272
00:15:50,731 --> 00:15:53,814
Well, we had to have certain player models and play testing, as I said before,

273
00:15:53,814 --> 00:15:57,757
I keep saying play testing all the time, because it's really important.

274
00:15:57,757 --> 00:15:58,017
But.

275
00:15:58,737 --> 00:16:04,178
It's, we needed to make sure that we hit those progression targets for each of the difficulties

276
00:16:04,178 --> 00:16:10,000
and those player types. So we had three player types. We had the linear, average, and wide players,

277
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,420
how they played the game. It's trying to match, you know, how much of the open world content that

278
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:19,481
they had done. Linear is just going through the main story. Average is doing kind of a mixture

279
00:16:19,481 --> 00:16:22,842
of a little bit of content, some aside stuff, and wide goes as wide as possible.

280
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:31,201
sword level, HP, like where they were when they did onsen, armor, etc.

281
00:16:31,201 --> 00:16:32,842
And see where they landed.

282
00:16:32,842 --> 00:16:36,504
And if that matched their expectation for that band of hits to kill.

283
00:16:36,504 --> 00:16:39,906
In the upper right you can see a chart of five players who finished the game

284
00:16:39,906 --> 00:16:41,627
and we can consider them the average band.

285
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:44,309
And what's really great about looking at that and seeing where they were

286
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:47,151
and how much content they had completed over time,

287
00:16:47,151 --> 00:16:48,692
we can ask them questions.

288
00:16:53,914 --> 00:16:56,995
but more like, oh yeah, did you feel like your upgrades mattered?

289
00:16:56,995 --> 00:17:00,396
Did you feel like you were fulfilling the samurai fantasy in this way?

290
00:17:00,396 --> 00:17:02,636
Did you feel kind of like that journey?

291
00:17:02,636 --> 00:17:05,957
Which is really great because we target this specifically.

292
00:17:05,957 --> 00:17:10,198
But there are parts where we had to bend the rules, you know, like not

293
00:17:10,198 --> 00:17:12,799
this is not a one size fits all solution, you know,

294
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,580
maybe painfully obvious to you, but duels are boss fights.

295
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,940
And we thought, oh, we can apply the same kind of lethality

296
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,921
feeling to this experience. But.

297
00:17:20,389 --> 00:17:23,873
You know, if it's over in seconds, you know, that's not what players wanted.

298
00:17:23,873 --> 00:17:27,136
You know, we we are heavily inspired by Samurai films.

299
00:17:27,136 --> 00:17:32,281
But even though those battles over in seconds, it didn't exactly match that.

300
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:34,684
So what players wanted was like a skill challenge.

301
00:17:34,684 --> 00:17:36,225
They wanted a longer fight.

302
00:17:36,383 --> 00:17:40,328
more defensive, more agile, and they wanted to make sure that it felt like it was a longer,

303
00:17:40,328 --> 00:17:45,895
you know, longer experience. And kind of the same as Samurai Cinema, it's kind of a reversal of

304
00:17:45,895 --> 00:17:52,323
expectations. So we kind of had to flip it around and say, okay, hits to kill have to be higher,

305
00:17:52,323 --> 00:17:56,107
we have to add a health bar back, which actually kind of helped because it made it feel more like

306
00:17:56,672 --> 00:17:59,534
an epic boss fight, which is the point.

307
00:17:59,534 --> 00:18:02,375
And we had it kind of subdivided a little bit with, you know,

308
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,156
Clash of the Sword to say, okay, this is not too long.

309
00:18:04,156 --> 00:18:06,718
Yeah, this is a lot more hits, but, you know,

310
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:08,359
each section feels appropriately length.

311
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:10,980
So kind of like players are like, okay, this doesn't feel like a slog.

312
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:16,103
So it was an interesting thing because we had to add the health bar,

313
00:18:16,103 --> 00:18:17,504
not just because it feels epic,

314
00:18:17,504 --> 00:18:19,024
but to understand when it hits a killer higher,

315
00:18:19,024 --> 00:18:22,406
we had to add a health bar to say, oh, am I making progress?

316
00:18:22,406 --> 00:18:24,808
As I said before in the UI slide,

317
00:18:24,808 --> 00:18:26,448
we condensed it down to like, you know, maybe.

318
00:18:29,725 --> 00:18:32,107
In this case, players wanted to know how far they were doing,

319
00:18:32,107 --> 00:18:35,110
how they're doing, it's long enough.

320
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,592
However, you know, still there were some issues

321
00:18:36,592 --> 00:18:38,093
with feeling too short or too long,

322
00:18:38,093 --> 00:18:39,875
and we iterate a lot on this in development

323
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,857
if we get the right feeling for our duels.

324
00:18:42,857 --> 00:18:44,679
Another element of where we had to bend the rules

325
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:46,320
was our multiplayer mode.

326
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:52,926
So Legends mode is a two to four player co-op experience.

327
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:57,604
And there's a lot of realities in multiplayer that we kind of had to kind of accept.

328
00:18:57,604 --> 00:19:00,846
And that is four versus one or even two versus one target.

329
00:19:00,846 --> 00:19:02,186
Enemies go down fast.

330
00:19:02,186 --> 00:19:06,749
And if HP is too low, it's going to be like they can't get any attacks out.

331
00:19:06,749 --> 00:19:10,892
They don't. That's the go to solution for everything.

332
00:19:10,892 --> 00:19:11,912
It's not what we were.

333
00:19:11,912 --> 00:19:14,934
We couldn't really do the same thing as before, especially too,

334
00:19:14,934 --> 00:19:17,676
because we also had more of a gear scaling, kind of like power scaling,

335
00:19:17,676 --> 00:19:20,237
gear power calculation that would scale a little bit

336
00:19:20,237 --> 00:19:21,738
between incoming and outcoming damage.

337
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,730
Plus, some of the player abilities are more magical in nature and like, you know, big

338
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,512
area of effect attacks and damage.

339
00:19:27,512 --> 00:19:30,795
We couldn't just do the same thing as before.

340
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:35,500
It gets even more applicable because supernatural enemies were a big part of this, you know,

341
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:35,700
the Oni.

342
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:40,600
And as a result, it was a situation where it felt like they're mini bosses

343
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,501
and they had their own abilities and magic and buffs like healing nearby enemies

344
00:19:44,501 --> 00:19:48,323
or, you know, regenerating or whatever it may be.

345
00:19:48,323 --> 00:19:50,824
And it was a situation where like, OK, we need a way to show this to the player.

346
00:19:50,824 --> 00:19:53,885
We had to show UI again, especially because, as I said,

347
00:19:53,885 --> 00:19:56,506
on the duel slide, the hits to kill is much higher.

348
00:19:56,506 --> 00:19:58,207
We had to show that progress.

349
00:19:58,207 --> 00:20:01,228
And it just it was a completely different expectation for our players.

350
00:20:01,756 --> 00:20:05,577
And as I said before, especially with these Oni enemies,

351
00:20:05,577 --> 00:20:11,318
we wanted them to live longer and be more of a threat to players.

352
00:20:11,318 --> 00:20:13,318
So, some final problems.

353
00:20:13,318 --> 00:20:15,799
This was a great push for us towards Samurai Fantasy,

354
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:18,440
but there were some issues we ran into.

355
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,420
One of them was over-leveling.

356
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,140
So, as I said before, the wide player,

357
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,021
the person we did it for our player models,

358
00:20:25,021 --> 00:20:27,662
they went wider than expected in our...

359
00:20:29,035 --> 00:20:30,595
never really mirrored the same thing.

360
00:20:30,595 --> 00:20:32,195
So you could do almost all the content

361
00:20:32,195 --> 00:20:34,476
in this lower portion of Tsushima, which is Zuhara,

362
00:20:34,476 --> 00:20:36,636
they would do almost all of it.

363
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:39,317
And then they would just start steamrolling their way

364
00:20:39,317 --> 00:20:41,157
through the rest of the content.

365
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:42,858
Well, part of this was actually acceptable for us

366
00:20:42,858 --> 00:20:46,398
on the player journey, where, oh, I'm becoming the ghost,

367
00:20:46,398 --> 00:20:49,239
I have new weapons, new ways to defeat enemies.

368
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:49,919
And it's like, okay,

369
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,620
it's okay to be a little bit overpowered.

370
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,600
Not perfect, there's a place

371
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,860
we could have done balancing here.

372
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,981
We tried to use that choke point, as I mentioned earlier,

373
00:20:56,981 --> 00:20:58,061
to kind of like hit a cap.

374
00:20:58,602 --> 00:21:02,042
But definitely we're like, OK, we thought we had a correct range,

375
00:21:02,042 --> 00:21:05,363
but we were a little bit off there. Definitely a place to improve for.

376
00:21:05,363 --> 00:21:07,104
Another part of this is damage reactions.

377
00:21:07,104 --> 00:21:10,765
We talked a little bit about this in the armor point slide.

378
00:21:10,765 --> 00:21:13,045
I know it was kind of confusing whether you're doing damage or not.

379
00:21:13,045 --> 00:21:16,766
This still applied in places for us, like when you have sparks versus blood,

380
00:21:16,766 --> 00:21:20,247
is what we said a lot like, oh, if blood comes out, they're taking damage.

381
00:21:20,247 --> 00:21:23,248
Especially like we have a similar stuff from like

382
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:24,708
to find a game terminology like super armor.

383
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,788
Those will show sparks because they.

384
00:21:26,896 --> 00:21:28,937
they're not being interrupted and they're going to come on through.

385
00:21:28,937 --> 00:21:32,399
But sometimes players would have a hard time reading that,

386
00:21:32,399 --> 00:21:34,860
especially because their combat speed was very fast.

387
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,722
That kind of combat feedback, even with sound effects and haptics and so forth,

388
00:21:38,722 --> 00:21:41,023
we didn't quite nail that feeling.

389
00:21:41,023 --> 00:21:45,846
It was not exactly what, you know, we didn't get a nail on a knockout out of the park.

390
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:49,648
But, as I said before, way bigger improvement over our previous iterations

391
00:21:49,648 --> 00:21:52,309
on giving feedback to the player on damage reactions,

392
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:53,870
but definitely room for improvement.

393
00:21:56,465 --> 00:22:01,026
So last thoughts and takeaways just for us and when working through this problem,

394
00:22:01,026 --> 00:22:04,587
you know, core design decisions and tuning should really be as much as possible

395
00:22:04,587 --> 00:22:07,468
support the character fantasy core system and core combat.

396
00:22:07,468 --> 00:22:10,429
Stuff like this has a huge impact on the play experience

397
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,150
and making sure that you can target say, oh, no, no, no,

398
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,150
we don't want to ruin that or undermine it.

399
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:17,351
It's easy to get caught into the swirl saying, oh, this system will help here.

400
00:22:17,351 --> 00:22:20,112
Or in my or another game, just like similar,

401
00:22:20,112 --> 00:22:22,433
we might have to go back to the drawing board a little bit.

402
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:27,219
especially for us, I'm talking about for lethality, you know, that goes both ways,

403
00:22:27,219 --> 00:22:31,425
that, you know, there's an expectation for that, and there's a lot of learnings for us on that angle.

404
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:36,442
And that enemy defensive behavior is critical, like the stagger, the blocking, the dodging.

405
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:40,025
You know, these are these are core combat mechanics are in a lot of games, too,

406
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,627
but really emphasizing that, especially for protecting low HP.

407
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:46,250
But in turn, of course, making sure player verbs and player attacks

408
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:49,392
and actions can counter and counter that gameplay.

409
00:22:49,392 --> 00:22:51,714
You know, stances for us was a big part of that.

410
00:22:51,714 --> 00:22:56,058
Make sure that was a solid part of the character fantasy, as I mentioned a second ago.

411
00:22:56,058 --> 00:22:59,720
And trust your design intuition on what does it feel like?

412
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,862
This is a lot of portions of this are designed by feel.

413
00:23:02,525 --> 00:23:08,170
And it's important to make sure that you understand that,

414
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:11,974
hey, this isn't like a perfect number that I need to get a

415
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:15,177
certain sense of how it's going to be. But of course, you got to

416
00:23:15,177 --> 00:23:17,879
verify with playtesting. It's always good to playtest as much

417
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:20,622
as possible and verify without your own confirmation bias of

418
00:23:20,622 --> 00:23:23,524
how you play it yourself a million times, which you should.

419
00:23:23,524 --> 00:23:28,288
Difficulty balancing escalation and progression should not

420
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:34,071
require major HP inflation. It would be best to make sure you try to avoid it,

421
00:23:34,071 --> 00:23:38,335
especially for, in our case, this character fantasy.

422
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:41,437
And a huge element is just making sure to push all the other knobs you've got.

423
00:23:41,437 --> 00:23:47,261
Aggression, moveset, timing, damage output, all these are really, really, really core.

424
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:51,344
But if you're going to increase HP, which we had to as well,

425
00:23:51,344 --> 00:23:54,867
do it carefully. Do it thoughtfully and with intention.

426
00:23:55,682 --> 00:23:58,242
It is okay to do so like we did before with character art,

427
00:23:58,242 --> 00:24:01,443
whether it be in our Legends mode or whatever it may be.

428
00:24:01,443 --> 00:24:04,284
Those are all important elements to consider,

429
00:24:04,284 --> 00:24:06,064
but do it in a way that you're mindful about it.

430
00:24:06,064 --> 00:24:08,785
So I really hope you enjoyed our kind of a quick look

431
00:24:08,785 --> 00:24:10,765
at how we tackle lethality within Ghost of Tsushima

432
00:24:10,765 --> 00:24:13,606
and its impact on combat balance.

433
00:24:13,606 --> 00:24:15,546
It was a rollercoaster and a ride,

434
00:24:15,546 --> 00:24:18,867
but we felt like we hit land on a pretty good solution.

435
00:24:18,867 --> 00:24:21,548
If you want to know more information at GDC 2021

436
00:24:21,548 --> 00:24:24,328
about Ghost of Tsushima specifically,

437
00:24:24,488 --> 00:24:29,432
There's another combat talk here at GDC from our studio head, Chris Zimmerman.

438
00:24:29,432 --> 00:24:34,416
He goes into more of the depth about the mechanics of combat, more like how we built them exactly

439
00:24:34,416 --> 00:24:37,959
and through the years of trying to work on this game.

440
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:40,560
And if you're interested in that, just make sure you check it out.

441
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,002
And yeah, it's a great talk.

442
00:24:42,936 --> 00:24:50,986
And lastly, we're hiring. If you like combat things, and if you are looking to work in combat design, we are hiring a combat designer.

443
00:24:50,986 --> 00:24:57,995
This is the kind of problems we try to tackle and what we try to do. And yeah, just apply below if you can, and otherwise, thank you for your time.
