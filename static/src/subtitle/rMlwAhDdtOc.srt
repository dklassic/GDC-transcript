00:00:06,774 --> 00:00:12,399
Hey, we're back and this is the second GDC podcast live episode.

2
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,922
I'm Chris Graft, editor-in-chief of Gamasutra.

3
00:00:16,402 --> 00:00:17,944
I'm here with Alyssa.

4
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:18,664
Yeah.

5
00:00:18,924 --> 00:00:19,305
Hello.

6
00:00:19,445 --> 00:00:20,286
I'm Alyssa Macklin.

7
00:00:20,386 --> 00:00:23,368
I'm news editor, associate publisher at Gamasutra, and they let us do this

8
00:00:23,408 --> 00:00:25,050
podcast a second time after.

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,691
Yeah, I know.

10
00:00:26,711 --> 00:00:30,795
I wonder if anyone except for our co-workers, like other than our

11
00:00:30,835 --> 00:00:32,056
co-workers are watching right now.

12
00:00:34,082 --> 00:00:37,144
But welcome and thank you for joining us,

13
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,446
those of you who are here.

14
00:00:38,846 --> 00:00:42,129
So it's weird, Alyssa, this is like episode 13

15
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:48,755
and I don't know about our guests mixed with number 13.

16
00:00:49,235 --> 00:00:50,216
It's a recipe.

17
00:00:52,054 --> 00:00:55,817
There's a lot of interesting timing with the live episodes of the podcast.

18
00:00:56,097 --> 00:01:00,079
Like yesterday, our guests coincided with an announcement that AbleGamers had.

19
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,682
And today, like lucky number 13 with a special guest, Mike Rose.

20
00:01:03,802 --> 00:01:05,863
So yeah, yeah, yeah, it is.

21
00:01:05,883 --> 00:01:06,924
It is Mike Rose.

22
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:08,605
I think do you think I spoil that?

23
00:01:08,705 --> 00:01:09,226
No, that's not.

24
00:01:09,326 --> 00:01:13,388
No, because if I like he is the draw, people will not be here

25
00:01:13,628 --> 00:01:16,190
if they didn't know that the Mike Rose.

26
00:01:17,351 --> 00:01:17,971
Certainly they're not.

27
00:01:18,572 --> 00:01:25,861
You're not here for us, but yeah, well let's talk about it a little bit. So our next guest for episode 13.

28
00:01:25,901 --> 00:01:26,322
All right.

29
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,818
He's taller in person than you'd expect.

30
00:01:32,199 --> 00:01:35,101
Once threw an individually wrapped pad of butter

31
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:38,583
at my eye during a dinner with PlayStation execs

32
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:39,503
while in Germany.

33
00:01:40,964 --> 00:01:46,207
He once worked for Tiny Build, the publisher Tiny Build,

34
00:01:46,587 --> 00:01:49,369
where he wore an orange baseball cap all the time.

35
00:01:49,529 --> 00:01:51,390
That was what he's most known for.

36
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:56,033
Now he is the founder of indie publisher No More Robots,

37
00:01:56,153 --> 00:01:58,234
and they've published games including.

38
00:01:59,763 --> 00:02:02,023
Descenders, ever hear of it?

39
00:02:02,784 --> 00:02:03,844
With the bicycles.

40
00:02:05,764 --> 00:02:08,625
That one game with the bicycles and the hills and they descend.

41
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:09,265
They go down.

42
00:02:09,285 --> 00:02:10,105
It's really cool.

43
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:12,006
Yeah, and they flip all over the place.

44
00:02:12,386 --> 00:02:13,066
It's very good.

45
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,027
Also, yes, you're graced.

46
00:02:15,747 --> 00:02:16,467
Yes, you're graced.

47
00:02:16,627 --> 00:02:21,948
And also the IGF finalist hypnospace outlaw.

48
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:27,255
But there's more. He has spoken at GDC multiple times about digital publishing.

49
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:31,361
I'm pointing at you like I'm chastising you.

50
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:37,089
We're on Zoom and I'm not used to my gesticulations being broadcast.

51
00:02:37,597 --> 00:02:40,818
Yeah, so, and he's talked a lot about digital publishing

52
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,178
and game discoverability.

53
00:02:43,198 --> 00:02:46,679
He'll be leading a live skill building series session

54
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:47,599
here at GDC Summer.

55
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,740
We'll talk about that in a little bit.

56
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,861
And he also used to work with me at Gamasutra,

57
00:02:54,021 --> 00:02:56,402
where we used to give each other endless crap.

58
00:02:57,142 --> 00:02:59,043
So, and he's a great guy.

59
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,783
So let's welcome Mike Rose.

60
00:03:02,676 --> 00:03:02,736
I

61
00:03:02,776 --> 00:03:10,561
mean you really need to update your personal page or get some kind of fact based thing.

62
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:14,523
I just need you. I just need a recording of everything you just said.

63
00:03:29,892 --> 00:03:31,913
It's probably when people want to know.

64
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:34,414
So, how have you been, Mike?

65
00:03:34,474 --> 00:03:38,395
You've had a busy past week, busy past three months.

66
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:40,476
You're always busy. That's one of the things about you.

67
00:03:40,516 --> 00:03:44,457
You seem to have endless amounts of energy for all these projects.

68
00:03:44,737 --> 00:03:46,618
So, how's it going at Normal Robots?

69
00:03:46,638 --> 00:03:49,839
Do you know what the funny thing is, though, that I really don't?

70
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:52,580
I actually think I did when I started this.

71
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,021
I think when I started this, I was...

72
00:03:56,342 --> 00:04:01,398
I was going to say I was still young, I absolutely wasn't, but I was less tired.

73
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,141
And now I am so tired, but I'm happy as well.

74
00:04:07,642 --> 00:04:10,663
So I'm happy about it all.

75
00:04:10,703 --> 00:04:13,545
But yeah, the answer is I don't have the energy to do it.

76
00:04:13,565 --> 00:04:17,167
I was saying to you guys just before we came on,

77
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:20,949
I'm getting to the end of this year now.

78
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:25,512
I'm ready to start winding down, which is kind of happening

79
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:26,172
with what we're doing.

80
00:04:26,812 --> 00:04:28,874
But yeah, it's been busy.

81
00:04:29,892 --> 00:04:31,873
Yeah, I have bad news for you.

82
00:04:31,973 --> 00:04:34,273
Like, there's still quite a bit of this year left.

83
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,914
Yeah, but I don't know.

84
00:04:37,334 --> 00:04:39,354
Time doesn't exist anymore, for one.

85
00:04:39,414 --> 00:04:41,115
So I don't know what you're talking about.

86
00:04:41,175 --> 00:04:42,015
No, no.

87
00:04:42,895 --> 00:04:45,656
Yeah, I mean, for us, like, we don't launch anything

88
00:04:46,196 --> 00:04:50,297
kind of between, like, October and December,

89
00:04:50,377 --> 00:04:51,237
because we just get...

90
00:04:52,223 --> 00:04:54,464
Steamrolled by AAA.

91
00:04:55,544 --> 00:04:59,966
So those months at least, I get to sit back a little bit.

92
00:05:00,006 --> 00:05:03,348
You know, we've got all the things like Steam sales, etc.

93
00:05:04,188 --> 00:05:04,788
Which is pleasant.

94
00:05:04,868 --> 00:05:09,550
But yeah, in general, I get to chill out a little bit more than usual.

95
00:05:10,171 --> 00:05:13,953
So, first of all, low energy for you is still up there.

96
00:05:14,393 --> 00:05:16,055
Yeah, I would say that, yeah.

97
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:23,720
Yeah. And so, what has, like, you just had an announcement recently, No More Robots have, a new game?

98
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:30,144
Yeah. Yes. Yesterday we announced, like, a new game we're publishing called Tombstar,

99
00:05:31,085 --> 00:05:34,307
which we're working with an Australian team on one of the...

100
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:44,218
People involved, a guy called Andy Sum, who made a game a while ago called Crossy Road, is probably like one of the biggest things that people know Andy for.

101
00:05:44,558 --> 00:05:50,025
Andy also, the first time we ever interacted was when I tweeted saying...

102
00:05:50,545 --> 00:05:55,287
Why is Andy made Crossy Road free? That's stupid. Like that's not gonna do well.

103
00:05:55,448 --> 00:06:00,550
And then a couple months later it exploded and then in a GDC talk

104
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:05,613
He then just had a slide which was just my tweet and that was it.

105
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:10,736
So that was one of our first interactions, but um, no, it's been it's been really interesting working with them

106
00:06:10,816 --> 00:06:12,837
and it's been interesting for me as well because

107
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:18,260
For some reason, I like additional challenges each time we work with someone.

108
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,283
Working with Australians is so strange because when I'm waking up, they're going to bed.

109
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:29,306
And then anytime we want to do any announcement or anything, it's in American time, when it's

110
00:06:29,466 --> 00:06:30,807
like four in the morning for them.

111
00:06:31,107 --> 00:06:35,610
So like when we announced the game yesterday, it was four in the morning for them, and I

112
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,750
think they were pretty tired.

113
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:45,581
But yeah, so we announced that yesterday and then today we were kind of announcing numbers because I've been doing this for three years now somehow.

114
00:06:46,943 --> 00:06:49,487
Yeah, so three years as of today, right?

115
00:06:50,096 --> 00:06:53,577
Yes, yeah, it's been a long time.

116
00:06:55,517 --> 00:06:58,818
And I and like the funny thing is, I've watched myself turn gray.

117
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:02,719
I know I look ginger right now, but it's just because of the light.

118
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,459
I'm actually so great.

119
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:05,560
It's unbelievable.

120
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,060
I'm glad this was a live like videocast episode.

121
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,560
So like when you said it's been a long time,

122
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,621
we could see you like staring off into the distance.

123
00:07:12,701 --> 00:07:13,801
It's contemplating.

124
00:07:14,121 --> 00:07:17,742
We should have just let you hang out there with yourself for a little bit.

125
00:07:17,782 --> 00:07:19,323
Hello, Dr. Smiled Friend.

126
00:07:20,604 --> 00:07:39,224
Now, I mean, you're known for, you know, speaking of GDC and I like, I mean, I'm pretty sure I assume that like 90% of your relationships, you know, are sparked from some kind of insult that you had someone like with Andy Sam saying like, who's this guy doing? He's doing it wrong.

127
00:07:39,244 --> 00:07:39,324
Yeah.

128
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:49,229
Now, but you do go to GDC and you do go to other places and you talk about digital publishing,

129
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:54,650
game discoverability is one thing that you talk about a lot, and you know, No More Robots is

130
00:07:54,690 --> 00:08:01,412
described as a data-driven publisher. Can you talk about that sort of thing and like some

131
00:08:01,552 --> 00:08:06,413
interesting stuff? You were just tweeting today about some data, you were very open with it.

132
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:09,914
Yeah, I think what...

133
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:18,680
When I was at Garmer, I remember I was always trying to do articles on numbers.

134
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,881
I was fascinated by numbers.

135
00:08:20,221 --> 00:08:24,406
And I was always fascinated the most by, like, I saw people putting games out,

136
00:08:24,807 --> 00:08:26,829
and they seemed to just be...

137
00:08:28,347 --> 00:08:33,291
Preying that the games were going to sell well, they didn't seem to be using any numbers or anything

138
00:08:33,331 --> 00:08:36,614
and they just seemed to be going, well, I hope people are going to like this and putting it out.

139
00:08:36,955 --> 00:08:40,298
And some would be like, yeah, my game sold and others would be like, oh, it didn't sell.

140
00:08:40,418 --> 00:08:47,925
Why? And I was always like, surely there are just ways to just sort out if a game is going to

141
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:51,068
do well or not. It can't just be random when a game comes out.

142
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:56,870
And that's part of why I ended up going into publishing and stuff.

143
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,951
I was just fascinated by this kind of thing.

144
00:08:59,551 --> 00:09:04,553
And then in the years between me stopped working with you guys

145
00:09:04,773 --> 00:09:05,853
and started my own thing,

146
00:09:06,453 --> 00:09:09,174
I just started to just hone in more and more on...

147
00:09:10,221 --> 00:09:12,462
what were the numbers that were important.

148
00:09:12,923 --> 00:09:15,284
And there's obvious ones that have come to light now.

149
00:09:15,324 --> 00:09:17,486
You know, everyone just talks about Steam wishlists

150
00:09:17,586 --> 00:09:18,667
all the time, for example.

151
00:09:19,067 --> 00:09:22,570
That's what my GDC talk is on tomorrow, actually.

152
00:09:23,971 --> 00:09:24,791
So that's like a big one,

153
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:27,513
but there's so many other little numbers here and there

154
00:09:27,593 --> 00:09:29,875
where if you're just gathering all of these things

155
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:33,278
and then looking at big old graphs all of the time,

156
00:09:33,886 --> 00:09:35,667
Just like I do every single day.

157
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,969
I was just looking at graphs before I came on this.

158
00:09:38,349 --> 00:09:38,710
And then...

159
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,271
Now you're looking at a graph.

160
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,152
Now I'm looking at a graph, yeah.

161
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:46,676
Then actually, it's quite...

162
00:09:46,696 --> 00:09:47,877
I was going to say it's easy.

163
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:53,241
It's not easy, but it's possible to source out

164
00:09:53,361 --> 00:09:55,042
how your games are going to do, you know,

165
00:09:55,142 --> 00:09:59,405
and actually be able to build some success piece,

166
00:09:59,485 --> 00:10:00,846
at least a level of success.

167
00:10:03,143 --> 00:10:05,584
That was my theory, anyway, when I started this thing.

168
00:10:06,024 --> 00:10:08,865
And I feel like I've proven that now.

169
00:10:09,765 --> 00:10:12,866
Of course, I would say to make out like, you know,

170
00:10:12,966 --> 00:10:14,226
well, anybody can do this.

171
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:20,027
Obviously, look, I am a massively privileged human being.

172
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,608
Even just coming from working with you guys in the first place,

173
00:10:22,628 --> 00:10:24,568
I already knew a bunch of people, you know, like...

174
00:10:24,969 --> 00:10:28,250
There were already connections I had, so I'm not gonna be like,

175
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,731
just do what I do and it'll work out great for you.

176
00:10:30,911 --> 00:10:33,292
I had to put in years and years.

177
00:10:33,772 --> 00:10:36,854
I was writing about games for like a decade before this, you know.

178
00:10:37,994 --> 00:10:38,734
So there is that.

179
00:10:39,475 --> 00:10:40,015
Yeah.

180
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:40,535
Yeah.

181
00:10:41,056 --> 00:10:43,016
You should, you should use that voice for the rest of...

182
00:10:45,698 --> 00:10:47,739
It's different from you at a pre-show voice too.

183
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:50,600
You've got like, I don't know, alternate voices.

184
00:10:51,181 --> 00:10:51,661
Yeah.

185
00:10:51,681 --> 00:10:52,481
Yeah.

186
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:57,064
Mike was actually doing some ASMR type stuff right before we went live.

187
00:10:57,104 --> 00:10:57,904
Type stuff.

188
00:10:58,385 --> 00:10:59,465
British ASMR.

189
00:10:59,505 --> 00:10:59,745
Yeah.

190
00:10:59,805 --> 00:11:00,486
Yeah, it's good.

191
00:11:00,986 --> 00:11:01,206
Yeah.

192
00:11:02,627 --> 00:11:03,687
Did you want some of that now?

193
00:11:07,077 --> 00:11:07,998
Yeah, let's do it.

194
00:11:08,098 --> 00:11:11,499
All right, Mike, do some of your findings,

195
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:14,200
up close and quiet, might be soothing.

196
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,480
Yeah, yeah.

197
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:19,382
I mean, I'll talk about one that I have been doing recently,

198
00:11:19,422 --> 00:11:23,784
and I plan to, I've been kind of building this data up,

199
00:11:23,844 --> 00:11:26,365
and I plan to do something big about it soon, actually.

200
00:11:27,165 --> 00:11:29,726
But one thing that has been fascinating me this year,

201
00:11:30,926 --> 00:11:40,575
is the Nintendo eShop. It's so weird, the Nintendo eShop. There isn't really another word for it.

202
00:11:42,317 --> 00:11:46,601
We started putting games on the eShop and I could just not work out.

203
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:53,485
How to make kind of games sell on this thing. Like we were doing fine on it, you know, the games were

204
00:11:53,705 --> 00:11:57,289
getting the porting cost back and all that, but I couldn't really suss it. And slowly but surely,

205
00:11:57,329 --> 00:12:04,557
I realized that the eShop is entirely based on how much...

206
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:06,980
Crap you can shovel.

207
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,083
Like just straight up, like how many copies can you get through the door?

208
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:14,965
Because the eShop, most stores, they're based on revenue, right?

209
00:12:15,846 --> 00:12:19,108
And it makes sense that they would be because it's, you know, when you,

210
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:22,390
if you heavy disc out your game, it balances out.

211
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:26,793
You still need to sell a lot of copies then to be kind of climbing charts

212
00:12:26,853 --> 00:12:29,975
and getting natural, like organic featuring.

213
00:12:30,555 --> 00:12:34,038
On the eShop, the eShop does not care if your game is 90% off.

214
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:38,201
It's level pegging with all the other titles around it.

215
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:41,863
So a $25 game and a $1 game, if they both sell one copy,

216
00:12:41,883 --> 00:12:43,364
they're both in the same place in the chart.

217
00:12:44,245 --> 00:12:47,307
That's why you may have noticed when you go on the eShop,

218
00:12:47,988 --> 00:12:50,029
the charts are just 90% off games.

219
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:53,511
Because a bunch of publishers and devs have realized this,

220
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:55,053
and then they just fill the chart.

221
00:12:56,594 --> 00:12:56,874
So...

222
00:12:56,894 --> 00:12:58,315
Is that good or bad?

223
00:12:58,335 --> 00:12:58,815
Well, I mean...

224
00:13:02,464 --> 00:13:04,845
You can... I'd love to know what you think, really,

225
00:13:04,865 --> 00:13:08,545
but from my perspective, it's not fantastic, you know, because...

226
00:13:08,565 --> 00:13:08,605
Uh...

227
00:13:11,706 --> 00:13:14,446
I mean, put it this way, we put out Yes, Your Grace on Switch recently,

228
00:13:14,466 --> 00:13:17,127
and it did decently on there. I'm happy with how it sold.

229
00:13:17,527 --> 00:13:21,207
But on the same day, a Sudoku game came out that was $3,

230
00:13:21,747 --> 00:13:25,428
and it was 66% off on launch day, so it was $1.

231
00:13:26,308 --> 00:13:30,809
And in two days, it got to number five in the top charts on Switch.

232
00:13:31,609 --> 00:13:36,694
And I now know how many units that means you're selling because the answer is a lot, right?

233
00:13:36,714 --> 00:13:41,179
So they were selling tons of units and they probably outsold us because of how many units

234
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,002
they were doing eventually. But anyway, about a month ago...

235
00:13:44,022 --> 00:13:45,964
Like I should have come up with pseudocures.

236
00:13:46,405 --> 00:13:48,147
I should just be putting out Sudoku games.

237
00:13:48,987 --> 00:13:54,791
The thing is that about a month ago I decided, right, well, okay, I'm gonna have a go at this.

238
00:13:54,891 --> 00:13:57,573
And this is the thing I've not really talked about yet and I plan to talk about in the future.

239
00:13:58,034 --> 00:14:01,957
About a month ago I decided, screw it, I'm gonna put one of our games 90% off,

240
00:14:02,357 --> 00:14:03,077
just see what happens.

241
00:14:03,978 --> 00:14:07,140
So you may or may not know, I have this game called Not Tonight,

242
00:14:07,841 --> 00:14:13,225
which is an anti-Brexit simulator, which obviously goes down well with everybody.

243
00:14:13,925 --> 00:14:18,027
And so I talked to the dev and he was like, yeah, let's just go for it.

244
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,148
We stuck the game on 90% off.

245
00:14:20,448 --> 00:14:22,389
After two days, we were in the top sellers.

246
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:27,692
And right now, if you check the eShop on your device, you will find the game.

247
00:14:28,132 --> 00:14:30,753
I think in the UK shop, it got to like number two.

248
00:14:31,134 --> 00:14:32,915
In most of Europe, it was in the top five.

249
00:14:33,755 --> 00:14:38,457
And we have just sold bucket loads of units in the last few weeks.

250
00:14:38,657 --> 00:14:43,859
Okay, the way that you're talking about this also, like, it's almost like you're acting like you're getting away with something.

251
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:46,720
You're like, okay, check this out.

252
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,581
I know, but this is the thing. That's not how it should work, right?

253
00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:52,022
Like, it just shouldn't work that way.

254
00:14:53,322 --> 00:14:59,885
And the problem for me is that I'm obviously not the only one who's realized this. I see

255
00:14:59,925 --> 00:15:03,706
everybody doing this now. I actually started doing it because I saw Curve Digital doing it.

256
00:15:04,186 --> 00:15:08,688
I saw one of their games over and over again. I've seen Team17 doing it. So I thought, screw it,

257
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:13,450
I'll join in. But the problem is the more and more people that do this, we all know how this goes.

258
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:18,112
We've seen this happen a million times. Yeah, of course. How many times have we seen this?

259
00:15:18,552 --> 00:15:19,432
And the thing is,

260
00:15:20,192 --> 00:15:25,537
Me trying to be like, well, I'm gonna stick to my guns and not do discounts for my games now.

261
00:15:25,877 --> 00:15:29,820
Then I just don't sell anything. So I have to join the race now.

262
00:15:30,321 --> 00:15:32,743
But when you deep discount a game like that on Switch and then you

263
00:15:33,363 --> 00:15:36,926
discount goes away, you're back at full price. How does that trend at that point?

264
00:15:36,966 --> 00:15:38,928
Does it still do well from being on those lists or?

265
00:15:39,128 --> 00:15:45,333
Yeah, so we, so actually the game just came off discount in the US.

266
00:15:46,274 --> 00:15:50,216
And yesterday it definitely didn't sell as many copies as it was while it was on offer,

267
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:55,779
but it actually did sell more units yesterday than it normally did before the sale, just from being

268
00:15:55,799 --> 00:16:00,821
in the top seller's charts. So at full price it's now selling decently because it's in the charts.

269
00:16:02,883 --> 00:16:05,384
But anyway, the point is that...

270
00:16:07,238 --> 00:16:09,859
Imagine what it's going to be like in six months on the eShop.

271
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:12,681
Like, once everyone's realized that this is the thing,

272
00:16:13,121 --> 00:16:15,942
all the people who listen to this now are quickly going into their Nintendo backends,

273
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:17,883
like, literally, like, putting 90% off.

274
00:16:18,223 --> 00:16:23,626
Like, it's, uh, it's gonna be, it's gonna be a, uh, an S show.

275
00:16:23,946 --> 00:16:26,828
I don't know if I can swear on this, but it's gonna be, it's gonna be bad news.

276
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,549
Uh, and, uh...

277
00:16:31,538 --> 00:16:33,520
I mean, I don't think Nintendo are going to do anything about it.

278
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,241
It's Nintendo we're talking about, isn't it?

279
00:16:35,442 --> 00:16:37,023
So they're not going to do anything about this.

280
00:16:37,524 --> 00:16:39,185
Have we had a Switchpocalypse yet?

281
00:16:39,305 --> 00:16:41,167
Is that a term that we coined?

282
00:16:41,507 --> 00:16:43,029
I think we're about to have a Switchpocalypse.

283
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,932
I think by this Christmas we will be.

284
00:16:47,945 --> 00:16:50,406
But anyway, that's just one of the lovely things

285
00:16:50,446 --> 00:16:53,248
that I've been experimenting with recently.

286
00:16:53,328 --> 00:16:54,849
Yeah, and you do this thing, like,

287
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:59,132
so for so many publishers and developers,

288
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:00,573
you know, smaller size,

289
00:17:00,693 --> 00:17:04,416
they have to do this kind of reverse engineering of it.

290
00:17:04,496 --> 00:17:06,477
And it's interesting, like, seeing it.

291
00:17:06,557 --> 00:17:07,718
And you've always been like this.

292
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:09,759
Like, things are a black box to everyone.

293
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:12,001
And then you kind of go to the end point.

294
00:17:12,121 --> 00:17:13,482
You go to the storefront.

295
00:17:13,602 --> 00:17:15,643
And then you just, you're just like.

296
00:17:17,044 --> 00:17:22,248
This is like, if you're listening, I'm making a hand motion like I'm unwrapping a tiny little

297
00:17:22,268 --> 00:17:23,429
present or something.

298
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:24,370
Yeah.

299
00:17:25,191 --> 00:17:25,711
Yeah.

300
00:17:26,451 --> 00:17:27,512
Yeah.

301
00:17:27,572 --> 00:17:30,715
Well, this is how, this is weirdly fun to me.

302
00:17:30,775 --> 00:17:33,637
Doing this, like, doing this being like, oh, I wonder what happens when it's 90% off

303
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,498
and I'm watching it every morning.

304
00:17:35,518 --> 00:17:38,561
Like my alarm would go off and the first thing I did was just grab the switch.

305
00:17:39,001 --> 00:17:40,744
Like, where are we up to on the eShop now?

306
00:17:41,044 --> 00:17:41,886
Checking the charts.

307
00:17:42,527 --> 00:17:43,949
Refreshing the store page.

308
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:45,772
And you're just like, it's working!

309
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:47,414
It's working! We're there!

310
00:17:49,647 --> 00:17:53,971
This is my life and I, for some reason, I love this stuff.

311
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:57,354
I love just working out how to break online stores.

312
00:17:57,675 --> 00:18:00,217
What's the next marketplace for you after you're done destroying the Switch?

313
00:18:00,257 --> 00:18:01,078
Like what's next?

314
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,040
Are you done initiating the Switch?

315
00:18:03,941 --> 00:18:04,661
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

316
00:18:05,122 --> 00:18:08,565
Well, the one I'm currently tussling with is PS4.

317
00:18:08,645 --> 00:18:13,169
We've only got one title on there and we're about to have Descenders on there as well.

318
00:18:13,209 --> 00:18:13,990
We're about to do...

319
00:18:14,991 --> 00:18:18,693
Our first retail game actually, in three weeks.

320
00:18:19,694 --> 00:18:24,157
Descenders is out on like August 25th I think, so that is massively exciting for me.

321
00:18:25,618 --> 00:18:28,419
But I guess that's going to be the next thing I'm tracking.

322
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,821
Is retail worth it?

323
00:18:31,901 --> 00:18:32,702
Like Roger Potts?

324
00:18:33,062 --> 00:18:35,804
You have an American radio voice too.

325
00:18:36,084 --> 00:18:37,265
Yeah, yeah.

326
00:18:37,285 --> 00:18:38,245
Switchpocalypse 2020.

327
00:18:40,065 --> 00:18:44,510
But this is the thing, the thing for me though is that like, uh, every single time I do something,

328
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:49,335
my immediate reaction for this kind of stuff is, right, I can't wait to collect all the data and

329
00:18:49,515 --> 00:18:53,920
show everybody in the world. Whereas I know that that's like, I get people telling me from like

330
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,984
other publishers, like DMing me being like, why do you keep doing this? Why do you keep telling

331
00:18:58,044 --> 00:19:02,849
everybody how to do everything? Every time you tell people, they just work it out and then

332
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:03,830
everybody starts doing it.

333
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,330
Hey, and like platform holders have always appreciated you

334
00:19:08,271 --> 00:19:09,851
sharing your reverse engineering results.

335
00:19:09,871 --> 00:19:11,131
I love data transparency.

336
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:11,872
They love it.

337
00:19:11,912 --> 00:19:12,552
They love it.

338
00:19:12,572 --> 00:19:13,832
Yeah, the platform holders love it.

339
00:19:13,892 --> 00:19:14,092
Yeah.

340
00:19:14,492 --> 00:19:16,453
Yeah, I remember, like, when I used to write about games,

341
00:19:16,493 --> 00:19:17,273
I was like, I don't care.

342
00:19:17,313 --> 00:19:19,473
I'll just dump any data anywhere because it doesn't bother me.

343
00:19:19,793 --> 00:19:22,454
Now I try to be a little more clever.

344
00:19:22,554 --> 00:19:25,855
I try not to be like, here's all our sales data

345
00:19:25,995 --> 00:19:27,975
for Xbox and PlayStation.

346
00:19:28,115 --> 00:19:31,916
This one easy trick to get to the top of the eShop,

347
00:19:32,316 --> 00:19:33,597
Nintendo hates it.

348
00:19:36,597 --> 00:19:37,177
That's what it is.

349
00:19:37,837 --> 00:19:38,117
Yeah.

350
00:19:38,358 --> 00:19:38,778
Yeah.

351
00:19:38,898 --> 00:19:43,000
It's always, it's always for free, but I don't care about giving data away because quite frankly,

352
00:19:43,821 --> 00:19:50,304
the industry changes so quickly that anything I, any, any guidance I give people six months

353
00:19:50,344 --> 00:19:51,645
later, it's completely different.

354
00:19:52,045 --> 00:19:54,547
Like the stuff I'm saying about Switch now in six months, it's not going to work anymore.

355
00:19:54,587 --> 00:19:58,409
No, but by the end of this show, it's going to be completely obsolete.

356
00:19:58,629 --> 00:19:59,769
So yeah.

357
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:05,653
Should we, let's see, should we go to chat Alyssa and just get like, there's one question.

358
00:20:06,213 --> 00:20:06,954
What was the question?

359
00:20:07,194 --> 00:20:08,395
Microdestroyer of worlds.

360
00:20:08,595 --> 00:20:08,875
Uh, no.

361
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:10,436
Um...

362
00:20:10,736 --> 00:20:14,779
Gabe, Gabe Poffcher asks, let me read this and make sure it's all...

363
00:20:16,822 --> 00:20:19,884
on the up and up, which you should do before you intro the question.

364
00:20:19,924 --> 00:20:21,245
Yeah, yeah.

365
00:20:21,445 --> 00:20:22,045
Hi, Mike.

366
00:20:22,265 --> 00:20:24,426
You're probably familiar with mailing list evangelist,

367
00:20:25,047 --> 00:20:29,369
Krisk Zuckowski, who I do know is a super nice guy.

368
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:34,712
When I asked him about the Discord strategies from your excellent GDC talks,

369
00:20:34,752 --> 00:20:39,034
he told me, quote, email kicks everything else's ass.

370
00:20:39,975 --> 00:20:43,357
Referencing 10 times higher open rates.

371
00:20:43,717 --> 00:20:44,678
Care to respond?

372
00:20:45,825 --> 00:20:46,609
Sure, sure.

373
00:20:46,689 --> 00:20:47,573
Screw you, Chris!

374
00:20:48,076 --> 00:20:48,257
Uh, no.

375
00:20:52,728 --> 00:21:01,676
Um, no, so so, uh, I I don't disagree but I also don't think that the two things are the same thing

376
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:04,819
Uh, this is gonna be a very boring next 30 seconds

377
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:10,864
The thing with mailing lists are they're great for just like trying to get a ton of people to quickly go to a thing

378
00:21:10,904 --> 00:21:17,791
You know, you email them all and then they're all clicking on a link and that's fantastic. But uh, it's also a very like

379
00:21:17,811 --> 00:21:18,712
uh

380
00:21:18,972 --> 00:21:20,893
You're like a very specific thing.

381
00:21:21,093 --> 00:21:23,134
Go here! Now go here! Now go here like this!

382
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:24,555
Which is great for that use.

383
00:21:25,496 --> 00:21:30,479
For me, one of the reasons why I build Discord communities for our games

384
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:34,881
is because the people who are in the community for your game

385
00:21:35,902 --> 00:21:37,423
are just so much...

386
00:21:38,823 --> 00:21:41,465
They're just incredibly useful people to have around

387
00:21:41,545 --> 00:21:45,047
because especially kind of once you kind of get in deep with them all

388
00:21:45,107 --> 00:21:48,029
and they feel like real connection to your game,

389
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:53,292
They end up doing so much more for your game than just clicking on some links.

390
00:21:53,492 --> 00:21:55,733
You know, you'll end up like...

391
00:21:56,193 --> 00:21:58,094
We always get whenever one of our games launches,

392
00:21:58,514 --> 00:21:59,635
within the first couple of hours,

393
00:21:59,955 --> 00:22:03,216
we've got a bunch of positive reviews on Steam already.

394
00:22:03,276 --> 00:22:05,797
Because all of these people who were super invested in the game

395
00:22:06,357 --> 00:22:07,698
have now all quickly bought it.

396
00:22:07,718 --> 00:22:10,159
They're all in the Discord showing their screenshots of buying the game.

397
00:22:10,179 --> 00:22:12,760
Look how quickly I bought the game!

398
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,781
And then two hours later, they've all left a Steam review.

399
00:22:14,961 --> 00:22:16,582
And of course they've left a positive one

400
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:18,303
because they've been looking forward to the game so long.

401
00:22:19,424 --> 00:22:21,686
It's stuff like that, like when you want to do some testing,

402
00:22:22,387 --> 00:22:25,470
you can just grab some people from your Discord server who you trust,

403
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:26,491
kind of pull them in, say,

404
00:22:26,531 --> 00:22:27,853
hey, do you want to just check out this thing?

405
00:22:27,873 --> 00:22:29,174
We're doing some balancing on the game.

406
00:22:29,835 --> 00:22:32,198
There's just so many useful ways

407
00:22:32,698 --> 00:22:35,561
that you can utilize a community for a game

408
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:36,402
that...

409
00:22:37,176 --> 00:22:42,958
Don't come from the, like, anonymity of having a bunch of people on a mailing list, I guess.

410
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:46,000
Dig into, like, your Discord stuff. When you say, like, going through Discord,

411
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,901
you don't mean, like, I set up a server, here's one channel, and everybody just chats.

412
00:22:48,921 --> 00:22:52,663
Like, you do some really intricate Discord things, like weird tricks and ARGs, right?

413
00:22:53,303 --> 00:22:57,365
Yes, we do really weird stuff. I could probably talk for an hour about it.

414
00:22:57,465 --> 00:23:04,348
But the short version is that we do strange, like, D&D-style ARK stuff where...

415
00:23:04,828 --> 00:23:07,490
We're about to start one for Tombstar on Monday, actually,

416
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:12,072
where we get people, when they join the Discord server, they all join a team.

417
00:23:12,772 --> 00:23:15,514
And they all, like, pledge their allegiance to some team.

418
00:23:15,574 --> 00:23:16,434
So, like, in the new one...

419
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:22,620
It's either like the Space Force or it's this horrible gang, but maybe the Space Force are

420
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,264
the bad guys all along, you know, and then we'll have them all doing like things against each other.

421
00:23:27,504 --> 00:23:33,850
I think for this Tombstar one, we're doing like some weird like Risk-style board game,

422
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,953
where they're going to be like taking on a map and they're going to have to vote on

423
00:23:36,973 --> 00:23:38,734
where they want to take on the map and all this kind of stuff.

424
00:23:39,435 --> 00:23:41,657
It's nothing to do with the game.

425
00:23:41,697 --> 00:23:47,142
We always make sure that the weird games that we're doing are actually nothing mechanically

426
00:23:47,182 --> 00:23:52,507
to do with the video game itself, but they have the lore of the video game in them so

427
00:23:52,527 --> 00:23:58,132
that then when people play the game, they know the characters already and they know

428
00:23:58,172 --> 00:23:59,093
who they care about.

429
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:09,988
And in the meantime, it keeps them all entertained and makes them want to stick around in the community rather than just, you know, you invite them and say,

430
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:15,073
Gabe's coming out in six months, so just chill, chill and don't leave, please.

431
00:24:16,114 --> 00:24:22,380
It gives them a purpose to stay and it means when other people join as well, they're like, what the holy heck is going on in here?

432
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,982
And they kind of want to join as well.

433
00:24:25,978 --> 00:24:35,182
So there's also, uh, you know, since I've known you, you've really shown that you can find really

434
00:24:35,242 --> 00:24:41,224
obscure games and to what, to me, seemed like obscure places that are actually good games.

435
00:24:41,545 --> 00:24:47,127
And then, uh, I know you did that at tiny build and I know that you do that at no more robots.

436
00:24:47,607 --> 00:24:49,568
Can you talk about that?

437
00:24:49,668 --> 00:24:49,868
You know,

438
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:56,090
That process where you're being proactive and seeking out games and what catches your eye?

439
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:10,955
Yeah. I don't really know how I find them. A lot of the time it's like so random. Most of the games

440
00:25:11,095 --> 00:25:18,198
I either just like, I bumped into people at events and they just show me something on the fly.

441
00:25:19,163 --> 00:25:24,608
Because as you imagine, I see like a million games every single week, you know, literally millions of games.

442
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:30,852
And every now and again, one just catches my eye.

443
00:25:30,872 --> 00:25:39,739
I think the big thing for me that I try to tell people the most is that the reason I sign the games that I do

444
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:45,944
is because the moment I see them, then my brain goes...

445
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,112
Oh, what the heck is this?

446
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:52,853
And if I don't have that reaction, then the average person isn't going to have that reaction

447
00:25:52,893 --> 00:25:53,133
either.

448
00:25:53,493 --> 00:25:53,773
You know?

449
00:25:53,873 --> 00:25:57,514
Like if I don't immediately go, Oh, what am I looking at?

450
00:25:58,955 --> 00:26:02,876
And obviously, you know, sometimes I have that reaction and then I dig deeper and there's

451
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:07,097
something that maybe there's the pins aren't aligned.

452
00:26:07,157 --> 00:26:11,758
But, but in the games I have signed, that's happened with every single one of them, basically.

453
00:26:12,245 --> 00:26:15,147
Your games are all like different genres, different visual styles.

454
00:26:15,167 --> 00:26:17,349
Like there's, is there like a consistent thread through all of them

455
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:19,971
besides just that like wow factor in the back of your brain somewhere?

456
00:26:20,651 --> 00:26:21,211
Not really.

457
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:25,675
No, I think I made a conscious decision to not do that in the first place.

458
00:26:25,715 --> 00:26:30,378
I saw like, um, I saw people like Devolver, you know, uh, at the time when I

459
00:26:30,418 --> 00:26:31,259
started, especially.

460
00:26:33,661 --> 00:26:39,364
I know that they've moved away from that a bit now.

461
00:26:40,785 --> 00:26:43,307
But I felt like I didn't want to do that.

462
00:26:44,168 --> 00:26:48,711
I felt like I wanted it to be more that I'm just all over the place.

463
00:26:48,731 --> 00:26:49,992
What will you do next?

464
00:26:50,012 --> 00:26:55,455
I've got this mountain bike game and now I've got this alternate reality 90s internet simulator,

465
00:26:57,904 --> 00:26:59,766
I really don't care what genre it is.

466
00:27:00,246 --> 00:27:02,307
If it's weird, I like it.

467
00:27:02,327 --> 00:27:04,789
Does that present a marketing challenge at all?

468
00:27:04,809 --> 00:27:06,511
Like jumping around like that so wildly?

469
00:27:06,551 --> 00:27:07,732
How do you handle that?

470
00:27:08,112 --> 00:27:11,374
In a weird way, the opposite is a marketing challenge for me.

471
00:27:11,434 --> 00:27:12,055
When a game is...

472
00:27:14,334 --> 00:27:15,655
is like other games.

473
00:27:16,055 --> 00:27:17,136
It's a marketing challenge.

474
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:22,059
A lot of the time, when I first come to write the first press release announcing a game,

475
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:22,979
you know, one of our games,

476
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:25,200
and I'm like, oh God, like, maybe this will be hard.

477
00:27:25,581 --> 00:27:27,582
And then I sit there and I just start typing, I'm like...

478
00:27:28,489 --> 00:27:33,890
This is a piece of piss, like I can just easily talk about this because it's like literally no other game.

479
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,991
Like when I first type in out the sentence,

480
00:27:36,511 --> 00:27:42,492
Hypnospace Outlaw, new game from No More Robots is a 90s alternate reality internet simulator.

481
00:27:43,212 --> 00:27:46,633
And that immediately is just like, someone's going to click that.

482
00:27:46,753 --> 00:27:47,933
Yeah, that's it right there.

483
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:49,833
Yeah, yeah, like it's just weird.

484
00:27:49,873 --> 00:27:53,214
And I, so I think if anything, having more, having like...

485
00:27:54,235 --> 00:27:57,956
Assigning more generic games is harder, I think,

486
00:27:58,196 --> 00:28:01,218
because then how do you describe a more generic game

487
00:28:01,378 --> 00:28:02,658
that is like a lot of other games?

488
00:28:03,379 --> 00:28:05,880
And that's what I wanted to touch on too.

489
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,661
And we're going to get to this next question in a second.

490
00:28:09,801 --> 00:28:15,624
But it kind of boils down to the game itself is,

491
00:28:16,404 --> 00:28:19,266
you know, it's its own marketing material, right?

492
00:28:19,306 --> 00:28:21,366
At least that's what it seems like with your stuff.

493
00:28:21,807 --> 00:28:27,731
That's exactly it. Like, I obviously, I would, I love to say that I'm fantastic at what I do,

494
00:28:27,891 --> 00:28:35,696
of course I do, but the truth is that half the battle is the game itself and the truth is I

495
00:28:35,777 --> 00:28:39,879
pick the games specifically because I see something in them where I'm like,

496
00:28:39,899 --> 00:28:42,441
I'm going to be able to sell the crap out of this. Like, this is...

497
00:28:43,002 --> 00:28:46,983
I'm already, I can already, when I'm first talking to a dev and I'm on like the first

498
00:28:47,023 --> 00:28:50,183
call with them, talking about whether we should work together or not, I'm already sat there

499
00:28:50,223 --> 00:28:51,484
like scribbling things down.

500
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:52,464
Oh, I could do this.

501
00:28:52,544 --> 00:28:54,484
I could say this thing and all this kind of stuff.

502
00:28:54,785 --> 00:28:58,566
Like when we were first talking about Hypnospace, we were saying, oh, when we launch this, we

503
00:28:58,586 --> 00:29:02,787
should put out like AOL style CDs to press for it.

504
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:03,787
That would be hilarious.

505
00:29:04,187 --> 00:29:09,208
Like I already know when I first started talking to someone, if I'm going to be able to sell

506
00:29:09,288 --> 00:29:12,529
a thing just from whether or not my brain is exploding with it or not.

507
00:29:12,992 --> 00:29:18,453
Yeah, that's what happens a lot of the time. We do have a question from Ajit Singh asking,

508
00:29:18,993 --> 00:29:24,354
what is the, just straightforward, what is the best, what are the best methods for promoting an

509
00:29:24,394 --> 00:29:34,357
indie game? Well, god that's wide isn't it? I will say that the best ways

510
00:29:39,147 --> 00:29:49,993
uh are the ways where you can actually see the uh let me see how to word this the best ways that

511
00:29:50,093 --> 00:29:54,175
i have found when i'm selling things are ones where i can straight up see whether it's having

512
00:29:54,215 --> 00:29:59,578
an effect or not rather than just doing things and like hoping oh i hope this is going to do something

513
00:30:00,278 --> 00:30:00,338
uh

514
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:08,501
For example, social media stuff, quite frankly, doesn't do a lot for us, to be honest.

515
00:30:08,861 --> 00:30:12,563
Obviously, we still do social media stuff. It would be crazy not to.

516
00:30:13,023 --> 00:30:15,124
But we do not focus hard on it because

517
00:30:15,935 --> 00:30:20,519
tweets and Facebook and all that for our games. They don't really do anything. We might get like

518
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:25,963
two clicks on a link, a tweet or something like that. It's not fantastic. The stuff that does

519
00:30:26,023 --> 00:30:34,970
work for us is the Discord stuff. The running a private beta before we launch a game, you know,

520
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:40,814
kind of giving away like the first level of one of our games. We normally try to give sort of like

521
00:30:41,855 --> 00:30:48,662
20 to 30 minutes of the game away via like a steam key and we then say to people when

522
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:50,524
they're signing up for that, hey why don't you uh...

523
00:30:51,327 --> 00:30:54,648
Might you give us a little cheeky Steam wishlist while you're doing that?

524
00:30:55,028 --> 00:30:58,129
And that works amazingly, you know, because then every single person

525
00:30:58,409 --> 00:31:01,149
that we're convincing to wishlist the game on Steam

526
00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:04,750
is then getting an email on the day that the game launches to say,

527
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,471
hey, remember this game you wishlisted?

528
00:31:06,991 --> 00:31:09,512
It's stuff like that that's actually tangible.

529
00:31:10,212 --> 00:31:13,313
Like someone is going to hear, that person's now going to hear about

530
00:31:13,653 --> 00:31:14,773
the game the day it launches.

531
00:31:15,253 --> 00:31:16,514
That's invaluable.

532
00:31:17,454 --> 00:31:19,315
So it's stuff like that trying to...

533
00:31:20,368 --> 00:31:26,231
Build the numbers that matter really is the most important thing to us.

534
00:31:27,551 --> 00:31:28,652
I hope that answered the question.

535
00:31:28,892 --> 00:31:31,633
It was quite a wide ranging question, really, wasn't it?

536
00:31:32,053 --> 00:31:36,194
Yeah. And you can find all of Mike's obsolete talks on GDC YouTube.

537
00:31:36,815 --> 00:31:43,297
Yeah. But, you know, speaking of talks and stuff,

538
00:31:43,417 --> 00:31:46,878
we've got about four minutes before we have to go to a break.

539
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:47,999
Oh, and so fast.

540
00:31:49,272 --> 00:31:49,432
Sorry.

541
00:31:49,452 --> 00:31:49,692
I did.

542
00:31:50,973 --> 00:31:52,354
Did you have something you wanted to ask, Alyssa?

543
00:31:52,634 --> 00:31:53,194
No, I'm just...

544
00:31:53,214 --> 00:31:53,594
Do you mind?

545
00:31:53,894 --> 00:31:54,315
There's a lot.

546
00:31:54,355 --> 00:31:57,096
There's some other good questions in chat and other good questions that we did.

547
00:31:57,116 --> 00:31:58,176
There's not enough time.

548
00:31:58,196 --> 00:31:59,377
We still got some time.

549
00:31:59,397 --> 00:32:00,978
Let's just power through them.

550
00:32:01,258 --> 00:32:02,298
I'll do 20 seconds.

551
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:04,139
Boom, boom, boom.

552
00:32:04,719 --> 00:32:09,202
But wishlists, you mentioned wishlists and your session is going to be about wishlists.

553
00:32:09,462 --> 00:32:09,962
Yes.

554
00:32:10,402 --> 00:32:13,323
Just spoil the whole talk in the next three and a half minutes for a few people.

555
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:19,560
Yeah, I can do that. So tomorrow I will be giving a talk, a GDC summer talk,

556
00:32:20,862 --> 00:32:24,045
about building Steam wishlists, all the ways that we do it.

557
00:32:25,167 --> 00:32:28,791
Steam wishlists are important because part of what I was just saying there,

558
00:32:29,052 --> 00:32:32,596
it's a tangible number. We know now that, for example,

559
00:32:33,477 --> 00:32:39,339
Roughly 25% of Steam wishlists end up converting into sales,

560
00:32:40,239 --> 00:32:44,981
which, you know, if you build 30,000 wishlists before you launch your game,

561
00:32:45,341 --> 00:32:49,242
you already know that you're going to get, you know, a decent number of sales,

562
00:32:49,282 --> 00:32:50,923
which is obviously really useful.

563
00:32:51,443 --> 00:32:56,444
So my talk is essentially going to be going through all of the ways

564
00:32:56,985 --> 00:33:02,146
that we attempt to make those wishlist numbers go up.

565
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,958
That's it. That's the talk.

566
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,022
Hope you liked it!

567
00:33:09,983 --> 00:33:11,105
There's the Destiny meme like,

568
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:12,066
yes, number go up!

569
00:33:12,086 --> 00:33:13,348
And it's the same for game publishing.

570
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,412
It's literally the same. Isn't it life though?

571
00:33:17,113 --> 00:33:18,875
Life is just the numbers going up.

572
00:33:18,895 --> 00:33:20,177
That's what it is.

573
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,843
Okay, I think that what we can do is take a break and everybody hanging out in chat,

574
00:33:26,824 --> 00:33:32,949
there's going to be a word from our sponsor, but stick around. We'll hang out with you and chat

575
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:38,753
for a little bit and don't go anywhere. And we're going to roll. I'll try and answer some questions

576
00:33:38,793 --> 00:33:43,196
in the chat as well. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Stick around. Great idea. All right. Be back in a

577
00:33:43,216 --> 00:33:48,400
little bit. Up next, we'd like to welcome one of our sponsors, Eric Morales, gaming segment leader

578
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,761
at Amazon Web Services.

579
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:53,402
Hey Eric, thanks for joining us all the way from Sweden, right?

580
00:33:54,142 --> 00:33:55,863
That's right. Hey Chris, thanks for having me.

581
00:33:56,463 --> 00:33:59,403
Yeah, so tell us a little bit about yourself,

582
00:33:59,924 --> 00:34:03,544
your game dev background, and what you do at AWS.

583
00:34:04,244 --> 00:34:12,486
Yeah, absolutely. So I am an enthusiastic and somewhat aggressive gamer in my personal life.

584
00:34:13,206 --> 00:34:14,966
I love to avoid warranties and

585
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:22,119
um and a bit of a gadget hound as well so um I uh kind of on the personal side I've been um

586
00:34:25,171 --> 00:34:27,352
a storied Neo Geo collector in the past.

587
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:30,893
And I've been able, thankfully, you know, thanks to the work

588
00:34:30,953 --> 00:34:34,013
with I've done with AWS over the last few years, really kind of pivot

589
00:34:34,033 --> 00:34:37,354
my career to working with game developers all over the world,

590
00:34:37,394 --> 00:34:40,255
which has been my passion for a long time, and I'm thrilled to be able to do it.

591
00:34:41,215 --> 00:34:45,816
Yeah. So my role at AWS is I currently lead the commercial business

592
00:34:45,856 --> 00:34:51,298
for AWS into the video game sector, which is what we call AWS Game Tech.

593
00:34:52,016 --> 00:34:56,739
And so my team helps game developers build really fun, engaging games with the cloud.

594
00:34:57,639 --> 00:35:04,463
My background in games is mostly as a fan, but I've had the privilege of working with

595
00:35:04,503 --> 00:35:08,246
game developers at AWS since 2011 when I first joined.

596
00:35:08,946 --> 00:35:13,289
Great. A friend of mine actually incidentally worked on the Samurai Showdown re-release.

597
00:35:13,949 --> 00:35:14,410
Oh my god.

598
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,210
You should check that out.

599
00:35:15,911 --> 00:35:17,452
It is fantastic for the record.

600
00:35:19,264 --> 00:35:20,064
I'll pass that along.

601
00:35:20,404 --> 00:35:23,125
So can you give us a rundown of the ways

602
00:35:23,285 --> 00:35:26,346
that the cloud benefits next gen game development?

603
00:35:27,407 --> 00:35:28,147
Yeah, absolutely.

604
00:35:28,467 --> 00:35:32,369
I think starting with sort of the console space, right?

605
00:35:32,549 --> 00:35:34,850
Obviously there's a brand new console generation,

606
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:37,131
Gen 9, that's right on the cusp of launching

607
00:35:37,171 --> 00:35:39,752
in Q4 of this year.

608
00:35:39,772 --> 00:35:43,533
The hardware requirements have been top of mind

609
00:35:43,573 --> 00:35:44,314
for a lot of people.

610
00:35:44,354 --> 00:35:45,374
Some of the really innovative

611
00:35:46,135 --> 00:35:49,378
storage work that Sony's been doing in the PS5,

612
00:35:49,418 --> 00:35:52,602
some of the really innovative business model innovations

613
00:35:52,622 --> 00:35:54,284
that Microsoft's been doing for the Xbox.

614
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:55,905
There's lots of exciting things happening

615
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:59,029
on the console side, but kind of first and foremost,

616
00:35:59,109 --> 00:36:00,871
major fidelity increases are happening

617
00:36:00,891 --> 00:36:01,612
in this next generation.

618
00:36:03,414 --> 00:36:06,898
Developers are increasingly seeing expectations from consumers,

619
00:36:06,978 --> 00:36:10,982
thanks to this next wave of hardware to deliver super high definition.

620
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:16,188
So UHD plus 4K experiences at 60 frames or higher.

621
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:18,531
And that's going to require.

622
00:36:19,132 --> 00:36:23,934
You know, more technical capability, it's going to require more infrastructure to kind of back that up.

623
00:36:24,014 --> 00:36:25,915
And that's just on the console side.

624
00:36:25,955 --> 00:36:32,938
In addition, we actually see beyond just kind of the two workhorse consoles that are on the cusp of launching.

625
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:37,561
There's just a ton of really interesting developments on the business side

626
00:36:38,082 --> 00:36:42,766
throughout the rest of the industry. Think about subscription-based services like Apple Arcade

627
00:36:43,186 --> 00:36:49,751
that are kind of spanning both mobile and desktop experiences and streaming-based services,

628
00:36:49,852 --> 00:36:54,716
right? Like Black Nut out of France or Stadia by Google. There's lots of really interesting

629
00:36:54,756 --> 00:36:57,878
things that are happening. And we think that the

630
00:36:59,171 --> 00:37:01,552
The sort of centralized common point

631
00:37:01,592 --> 00:37:04,572
between all of these trends is that, you know,

632
00:37:05,112 --> 00:37:09,153
the expectations of consumers for what a game needs to be

633
00:37:09,213 --> 00:37:11,494
is going to be impacted by the inputs

634
00:37:11,554 --> 00:37:12,814
from the developers over time.

635
00:37:12,854 --> 00:37:16,275
It's going to change the way that developers stay productive

636
00:37:16,295 --> 00:37:20,296
and it's going to change the velocity

637
00:37:20,316 --> 00:37:22,816
that developers produce and create games.

638
00:37:22,856 --> 00:37:24,357
And that's an area where the cloud can really help.

639
00:37:24,857 --> 00:37:30,302
Getting access to tremendously powerful infrastructure with a single line of code.

640
00:37:31,483 --> 00:37:34,826
One quick API call gets you the ability to have a massive workstation,

641
00:37:35,066 --> 00:37:39,009
use it for an hour, and then throw it away. That changes the way that people develop games,

642
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:46,356
both in the HD set as well as for mobile. Yeah, so it sounds very developer-centric.

643
00:37:46,947 --> 00:37:51,154
And you kind of went into some of the answer to this question, but some of the,

644
00:37:51,334 --> 00:37:55,761
uh, like the goals that you have when, uh, working with game developers.

645
00:37:55,781 --> 00:37:56,542
So what are those?

646
00:37:56,562 --> 00:37:59,667
It seems a lot of it is like ease of use and increased productivity.

647
00:38:00,714 --> 00:38:05,777
Sure, yeah. So we come at it from a couple of different angles, right? So AWS is known for,

648
00:38:06,178 --> 00:38:10,740
you know, we have 175 plus services. That can be daunting to a lot of people who go to the website

649
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:16,464
and see, you know, dozens, hundreds of individual services. But, you know, fundamentally, the way

650
00:38:16,484 --> 00:38:21,187
that we break these down is we wanted to give every developer in the world the same capabilities

651
00:38:21,307 --> 00:38:27,030
of a massive enterprise class data center, but with the ability to use as little or as much of

652
00:38:27,311 --> 00:38:29,792
those capabilities as you want and on your own terms.

653
00:38:30,412 --> 00:38:36,695
So only paying for what you actually use and giving customers the flexibility and

654
00:38:36,735 --> 00:38:40,277
power to get access to the infrastructure they need to get their job done.

655
00:38:40,597 --> 00:38:44,879
And so the way that we interact with this industry is both kind of from

656
00:38:44,899 --> 00:38:51,822
the backend forward as well as from the productivity side and in, right?

657
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:54,523
So from a backend perspective, we obviously support

658
00:38:55,710 --> 00:39:10,179
We have a myriad of storage options ranging from Amazon S3, which is a great way for people to deliver files, to a variety of database services like Amazon Aurora, which is heavily in use by companies like Supercell and the Pokemon Company.

659
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:14,503
And that's an example of just the backend work we do.

660
00:39:14,543 --> 00:39:16,584
We also have a service called Amazon Game Lift

661
00:39:16,644 --> 00:39:20,327
that actually manages session-based game servers.

662
00:39:20,407 --> 00:39:22,889
So companies like Ubisoft have built games

663
00:39:22,989 --> 00:39:25,191
like For Honor sitting on top of Game Lift

664
00:39:25,371 --> 00:39:27,553
that make it really easy to build multiplayer experiences

665
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:28,013
that are live.

666
00:39:28,313 --> 00:39:29,734
But on the front end, right,

667
00:39:30,075 --> 00:39:31,916
we also want to speak to the artists,

668
00:39:32,456 --> 00:39:35,699
the people that are sewing together polygons

669
00:39:35,739 --> 00:39:38,521
and creating art, right, that's interactive.

670
00:39:39,421 --> 00:39:42,884
We want to help them make more fun, engaging titles, right?

671
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:44,865
And kind of our belief, our goal is that

672
00:39:45,185 --> 00:39:47,467
if we can make the lives of individual developers better,

673
00:39:47,847 --> 00:39:49,208
both from a creative perspective,

674
00:39:49,368 --> 00:39:50,930
as well as from a technical perspective,

675
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:52,811
it's going to result in more fun games,

676
00:39:53,051 --> 00:39:55,393
and more fun games are much more likely to be successful,

677
00:39:55,453 --> 00:39:56,273
which benefits everybody.

678
00:39:56,747 --> 00:40:03,529
Yeah, very cool. So as you said, there are a lot of services and it can be daunting, but do you

679
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:09,011
see game developers being more receptive to these cloud-based solutions over the past couple years?

680
00:40:09,771 --> 00:40:15,953
Absolutely. I think our goal, if I can be a little bit pithy, our goal is to work with

681
00:40:16,173 --> 00:40:22,275
every game developer in the world that's willing to talk to us. And if you're not specifically

682
00:40:22,555 --> 00:40:25,736
in the data center or hardware business, we want you to shut down your data center.

683
00:40:26,551 --> 00:40:30,537
Right? We believe that game developers are in the business of making games.

684
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:33,176
Pretty clear cut, right?

685
00:40:33,576 --> 00:40:37,298
And so anything that we can do to expedite that,

686
00:40:37,438 --> 00:40:40,860
to help increase the quality and the output and the productivity of those teams,

687
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,481
is something that we want to be a part of.

688
00:40:42,501 --> 00:40:45,623
And that's the purpose, the goal of AWS Game Tech in general.

689
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:49,104
We want to send a signal to the community and to customers all over the world

690
00:40:49,184 --> 00:40:52,086
that this team wakes up every single day

691
00:40:52,226 --> 00:40:55,688
and exclusively thinks about how to help developers make better games.

692
00:40:57,911 --> 00:41:03,554
You know, from a reception perspective, more than 90% of the major game developers and games

693
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:09,418
publishers, game studios in the world, use AWS today. So that spans both mobile, including

694
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:16,702
companies like Provio and Supercell and Voodoo here in France, and all the way up to kind of

695
00:41:16,742 --> 00:41:21,545
more AAA experiences. Gearbox Software built Borderlands 3 on top of AWS. We talked about

696
00:41:21,565 --> 00:41:22,506
the Pokemon company.

697
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,827
And literally hundreds of other customers.

698
00:41:25,907 --> 00:41:30,810
So this is a major market focus for AWS generally.

699
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,650
And we think we have a lot

700
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:33,871
that we can help customers deliver on.

701
00:41:34,652 --> 00:41:40,054
Yeah, so are we talking about small, medium, and large studios that you work with?

702
00:41:40,114 --> 00:41:42,474
Do you work, are you willing to work across the board?

703
00:41:42,494 --> 00:41:44,875
You have services for studios of all sizes?

704
00:41:45,635 --> 00:41:46,736
Studios of all sizes, right?

705
00:41:46,776 --> 00:41:50,077
I mean, look, one of my favorite games on the planet is Stardew Valley.

706
00:41:50,857 --> 00:41:54,038
Stardew Valley, to my knowledge, not running on AWS today,

707
00:41:54,138 --> 00:41:56,838
but Stardew Valley was made by one passionate person, right?

708
00:41:57,239 --> 00:41:59,019
Over time, it took several years, obviously.

709
00:41:59,539 --> 00:42:01,100
We would love to work with developers like that.

710
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,782
Our goal is regardless of your genre,

711
00:42:04,082 --> 00:42:06,543
regardless of whether a game is single player

712
00:42:06,583 --> 00:42:09,445
or multiplayer, the cloud can help you get things done.

713
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:11,587
Right, a classic example of this is,

714
00:42:12,648 --> 00:42:14,169
you know, we work with a customer

715
00:42:14,629 --> 00:42:15,970
who's made a game called AI Dungeon,

716
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:18,732
and AI Dungeon 2, you may be familiar with them, right?

717
00:42:18,972 --> 00:42:20,513
So they're actually using AWS

718
00:42:21,554 --> 00:42:24,035
to build the machine learning models that power that game.

719
00:42:24,055 --> 00:42:26,337
And that's made by just a couple of guys out of Utah,

720
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:28,218
and they've made this a really engaging,

721
00:42:28,278 --> 00:42:29,319
interactive experience.

722
00:42:30,991 --> 00:42:33,685
that's not using data center's worth of equipment.

723
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:39,624
But they're using the cloud to build really fun, interesting, unique, engaging experiences, which is the goal.

724
00:42:40,305 --> 00:42:46,931
Another example of this, just from a productivity perspective, is with a medium-sized studio, IO Interactive, based out of Copenhagen.

725
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:49,293
These are the folks behind the Hitman series.

726
00:42:50,073 --> 00:43:00,863
And they're actually using AWS services, specifically some of our AI and ML services, to actually help build the narrative for Hitman levels.

727
00:43:01,223 --> 00:43:05,768
Right? So when they were making Hitman 2, they used Amazon Polly, which is the voice engine

728
00:43:05,848 --> 00:43:10,993
underneath Amazon Alexa. They were using Amazon Polly to test out scripts and conversations

729
00:43:11,033 --> 00:43:16,519
between characters. And what that allowed them to do was develop the levels on the technical and

730
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:20,383
artistic side at the exact same time as they were writing and tweaking the script and the narrative.

731
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:25,413
And it meant that they could actually make changes to the storyline,

732
00:43:25,453 --> 00:43:30,557
they could do lots of creative work before hiring voice actors to do the final print, so to speak.

733
00:43:31,318 --> 00:43:35,721
And so this is a good example of how the cloud can help even single-player experiences that

734
00:43:35,741 --> 00:43:40,425
aren't necessarily connected all the time, and actually help developers impact the narrative

735
00:43:40,745 --> 00:43:42,807
experience of their games, which is really interesting.

736
00:43:43,488 --> 00:43:49,693
Yeah, that's very cool. And last thing, for game developers interested in finding out more about AWS, where can they go?

737
00:43:50,907 --> 00:43:56,052
Yeah, so we've got lots of resources for game developers all over the world.

738
00:43:56,072 --> 00:44:02,678
I think the best initial point to go to is aws.amazon.com slash gametech, all one word.

739
00:44:03,258 --> 00:44:07,182
And that's a nice collection of all of the games-related technology,

740
00:44:07,522 --> 00:44:11,446
including our services, as well as some software capabilities like Amazon Lumberyard.

741
00:44:12,286 --> 00:44:14,989
some access to our solutions, right?

742
00:44:15,009 --> 00:44:18,672
So like analytic pipeline solutions for developers

743
00:44:18,692 --> 00:44:20,533
that are looking to analyze player behavior.

744
00:44:21,094 --> 00:44:23,096
We have links to all of that starting on that website.

745
00:44:23,116 --> 00:44:25,478
We've also got really good deep dives

746
00:44:25,618 --> 00:44:29,121
into how our customers like Supercell, like Gearbox,

747
00:44:29,161 --> 00:44:31,683
like Rovio, like Capcom, like the Pokemon company

748
00:44:32,063 --> 00:44:34,285
and hundreds of others are using AWS every day.

749
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:36,587
So you can dig into those and get a sense

750
00:44:36,627 --> 00:44:38,869
of how other developers have used the cloud

751
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:40,330
to make really fun game experiences.

752
00:44:40,877 --> 00:44:41,077
All right.

753
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:41,638
That's great.

754
00:44:41,678 --> 00:44:44,459
Well, Eric, thanks for joining us today and best of luck.

755
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,220
My pleasure, Chris.

756
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:46,900
Thanks so much.

757
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:47,480
Same to you.

758
00:44:49,701 --> 00:44:50,841
Hey there, everybody.

759
00:44:51,322 --> 00:44:58,665
Welcome back to the GDC podcast live over to you, Christian.

760
00:44:58,685 --> 00:45:03,007
I thought, I thought you were going to, I thought you're going to throw

761
00:45:03,027 --> 00:45:05,348
that to Brian or Alex or Alyssa or anybody.

762
00:45:05,808 --> 00:45:07,669
It's everybody's podcast.

763
00:45:07,889 --> 00:45:10,170
I'm going to throw this one to, uh, to Alyssa then.

764
00:45:11,003 --> 00:45:12,624
We're wasting our valuable and limited time.

765
00:45:13,124 --> 00:45:17,786
We're now joined by fellow Gamasutra contributors and editors, Alex Waro and Brian Francis.

766
00:45:17,826 --> 00:45:19,007
Say hello and introduce yourself.

767
00:45:19,607 --> 00:45:21,328
Hello, I'm Brian Francis.

768
00:45:21,568 --> 00:45:23,149
I'm a contributing editor at Gamasutra.

769
00:45:23,189 --> 00:45:24,429
Yesterday I was called a hooligan.

770
00:45:24,449 --> 00:45:25,850
I insisted I was a highwayman.

771
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:27,331
I am today still a highwayman.

772
00:45:27,351 --> 00:45:28,231
Alex, who are you?

773
00:45:29,427 --> 00:45:30,708
Oh, I'm just like a general in there.

774
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:31,088
Do well.

775
00:45:31,828 --> 00:45:35,811
I'm Alex Barrow and editor at common future.com and I'm excited to get in

776
00:45:35,851 --> 00:45:37,352
here and talk about GDC summer.

777
00:45:37,752 --> 00:45:39,013
How's everybody's GDC going?

778
00:45:39,053 --> 00:45:39,694
How are you feeling?

779
00:45:40,094 --> 00:45:40,614
Whoo.

780
00:45:40,754 --> 00:45:44,097
I slept like five hours each day.

781
00:45:44,117 --> 00:45:47,279
Looking at the schedule for just what everything going on and how is it

782
00:45:47,339 --> 00:45:48,580
like the team behind the scenes?

783
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,100
Please sleep.

784
00:45:51,387 --> 00:45:56,053
Oh, Mike, did you have a good time in chat with everyone there?

785
00:45:56,093 --> 00:45:57,494
Did you answer everyone's questions?

786
00:45:57,554 --> 00:45:58,555
I had a fantastic time.

787
00:45:58,575 --> 00:46:02,420
We're going to see all these developers, their games are going to be at the top.

788
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,562
Of the switch chats.

789
00:46:04,902 --> 00:46:07,645
Yeah, this is a relevant question because we have now enough

790
00:46:07,706 --> 00:46:09,748
Gamma Sutra people here to dominate the conversation.

791
00:46:10,008 --> 00:46:12,391
Why was Gamma Sutra hacked at the start of the year?

792
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:18,775
It was a joke because none of us knew it was it could be anything.

793
00:46:19,035 --> 00:46:21,398
The Internet's magic and no one knows how it works.

794
00:46:21,859 --> 00:46:24,141
Yeah, that's actually the best.

795
00:46:25,823 --> 00:46:27,725
Were there any questions you answered during the break

796
00:46:27,765 --> 00:46:30,308
you wanted to elaborate on while we're on a hot mic?

797
00:46:30,328 --> 00:46:31,589
No.

798
00:46:35,288 --> 00:46:38,573
I think I answered every, I will say, if anybody has any more questions, keep throwing them

799
00:46:38,614 --> 00:46:38,834
at me.

800
00:46:39,635 --> 00:46:41,739
Uh, it's, it's half past 10 at night here now.

801
00:46:42,019 --> 00:46:43,883
I'm, I'm, I'm losing my mind.

802
00:46:43,943 --> 00:46:44,484
So it's fine.

803
00:46:44,604 --> 00:46:46,327
I have, I have a question for you.

804
00:46:46,367 --> 00:46:48,230
You started at the set of this, you, you, you.

805
00:46:48,648 --> 00:46:51,550
You identified a mindset which is like, oh, I hope this game sells.

806
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:54,331
You know, it's a thing that you saw when you were writing for us.

807
00:46:55,411 --> 00:46:58,192
I've met a lot of developers who sometimes sort of go,

808
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:00,373
it's not that, oh, we hope this sells.

809
00:47:00,433 --> 00:47:02,514
It's like, oh, no, we sort of trust that it'll sell.

810
00:47:02,534 --> 00:47:05,595
You know, we sort of trust that like if we get these reviews on scene,

811
00:47:05,635 --> 00:47:07,656
if we pay for these ads, that things will happen.

812
00:47:08,276 --> 00:47:10,317
That leads to a different mindset, a different kind of release date

813
00:47:10,337 --> 00:47:11,678
where either like, you know, the ad budget.

814
00:47:12,439 --> 00:47:16,881
It's very expensive and yet the numbers are just kind of okay and it may keep the developer alive.

815
00:47:16,901 --> 00:47:19,381
But it's not like, you know, it's not the strategy you pitched.

816
00:47:19,422 --> 00:47:22,383
Like, have you encountered that mindset with some of the developers you work with?

817
00:47:22,403 --> 00:47:26,764
How do you sort of behoove upon them that no, please take this seriously.

818
00:47:26,804 --> 00:47:28,024
We need to take this seriously.

819
00:47:28,425 --> 00:47:30,105
That we are in a system and we must exploit this.

820
00:47:30,165 --> 00:47:35,347
Yeah, I mean, what you've described quite frankly is probably most game developers.

821
00:47:35,907 --> 00:47:40,929
The thing you've got to always remember is people who make games are not

822
00:47:42,082 --> 00:47:47,065
Video game marketers, like they, they, people who make games went into make games to make games.

823
00:47:47,525 --> 00:47:50,906
They, how many times do you see, especially on like Twitter or something over the years,

824
00:47:51,347 --> 00:47:55,108
people who make games being like, oh, no one bloody told me I was going to have to sell this thing as well.

825
00:47:55,188 --> 00:47:58,230
Like, and, and to be honest, I understand it.

826
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:01,051
Like it is two completely different mindsets.

827
00:48:01,531 --> 00:48:02,912
I started trying to make video games.

828
00:48:02,972 --> 00:48:05,553
I went to university to learn how to do it.

829
00:48:05,974 --> 00:48:06,874
I failed miserably.

830
00:48:07,234 --> 00:48:11,996
So then I decided I'd jump over and start crapping on other people's creations.

831
00:48:12,316 --> 00:48:16,137
But like, this is the thing, like I say, it's two completely different mindsets.

832
00:48:16,217 --> 00:48:18,097
It's why so many people do need a publisher.

833
00:48:18,497 --> 00:48:24,739
When you find those people who make games and they're really like,

834
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:29,801
weee! And all that. I always think of good old Andy Schatz.

835
00:48:30,522 --> 00:48:34,346
Uh, he, he always, uh, he's, he's the kind of person I'm talking about.

836
00:48:34,386 --> 00:48:36,348
Or like, uh, Nathan Vela or someone like that.

837
00:48:36,628 --> 00:48:40,072
You can tell that they are just also going to be able to sell their game.

838
00:48:40,773 --> 00:48:43,616
Uh, but not everybody is, is a person like that.

839
00:48:43,897 --> 00:48:46,860
And so some people need someone to help them sell games.

840
00:48:47,261 --> 00:48:48,041
That's just how it is.

841
00:48:49,786 --> 00:48:53,269
Are you just covered in spreadsheets and things like that?

842
00:48:53,289 --> 00:49:03,339
I think a lot of people, if data is key to reverse engineer this stuff and get better

843
00:49:03,439 --> 00:49:08,304
insight into black boxes, how do you organize the data?

844
00:49:08,344 --> 00:49:09,886
How do you collect it and what's your process there?

845
00:49:11,974 --> 00:49:12,914
Oh, I just don't.

846
00:49:13,374 --> 00:49:17,515
I literally right now have over 20 tabs open

847
00:49:17,555 --> 00:49:20,536
and all of them is data from many, many different players.

848
00:49:20,556 --> 00:49:23,257
I've got Google Analytics here, I've got Reddit here,

849
00:49:23,357 --> 00:49:26,358
I've got YouTube stuff here, I've got Google Forms here.

850
00:49:26,418 --> 00:49:31,919
Like, I'm actually an incredibly unorganized person, truth be told.

851
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:35,900
It's actually why I have, the more games we got,

852
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,580
I've had to finally admit to myself.

853
00:49:38,563 --> 00:49:40,464
Maybe I actually need some help with this.

854
00:49:41,305 --> 00:49:44,687
And you know, there's now seven people who work at Nomar Robots.

855
00:49:44,707 --> 00:49:47,728
You know, and it's another point actually, like,

856
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:50,790
I figure, you know, a lot of people see me going,

857
00:49:51,271 --> 00:49:52,932
Ah, I'm Twitter, Nomar robots.

858
00:49:53,232 --> 00:49:54,613
But actually, there is like...

859
00:49:55,313 --> 00:50:00,177
Six other people who work with me, who helped me an incredible amount.

860
00:50:00,658 --> 00:50:03,500
I hired, I finally hired a producer earlier this year,

861
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,222
a wonderful lady called Sally Blake,

862
00:50:06,502 --> 00:50:08,884
who basically, since she started, has made me realize

863
00:50:09,125 --> 00:50:11,427
how on earth was I running this in the fucking first place?

864
00:50:11,687 --> 00:50:14,369
Like, it's crazy, I do not understand

865
00:50:14,389 --> 00:50:17,372
how I did this before I had her help.

866
00:50:18,332 --> 00:50:20,274
Get a producer, if you don't have one.

867
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:23,151
Please do it. I just didn't realize.

868
00:50:23,551 --> 00:50:27,832
But yeah, there's definitely people who helped me kind of keep this thing going.

869
00:50:27,852 --> 00:50:31,373
I want to ask a question from Vance Baron in the chat.

870
00:50:31,693 --> 00:50:32,293
Yeah.

871
00:50:32,893 --> 00:50:36,334
Who says, a lot of people have told me that as an indie dev,

872
00:50:36,374 --> 00:50:38,755
buying ads is completely useless.

873
00:50:39,795 --> 00:50:44,556
Is that true? And if not, where are the actually useful places to buy ads

874
00:50:45,156 --> 00:50:46,557
that NDEs could afford?

875
00:50:46,577 --> 00:50:50,338
Or are there more effective ways of promotion than that?

876
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:54,798
Yes, the answer is yes. Buying ads is useless.

877
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:04,770
The only place that I have found buying ads to be useful is Reddit, and I say this

878
00:51:05,698 --> 00:51:09,299
It's good for breaking even on your ads on Reddit.

879
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:13,019
So I have worked out how to,

880
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:14,880
the bottom line is on Reddit,

881
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,820
you can choose how much you pay per click.

882
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,421
So I just worked out the formula for

883
00:51:19,681 --> 00:51:22,161
how many clicks do I need before people,

884
00:51:22,642 --> 00:51:24,422
what's the percentage of people who click through

885
00:51:24,542 --> 00:51:25,482
who then wishlist the game?

886
00:51:25,522 --> 00:51:27,163
And how many of those people who wishlist the game

887
00:51:27,423 --> 00:51:27,983
buy the game?

888
00:51:28,283 --> 00:51:29,823
And then I can reverse engineer that back

889
00:51:30,143 --> 00:51:30,943
and work out, right,

890
00:51:31,303 --> 00:51:33,404
I need a click-through rate of 30 cents.

891
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:37,447
And so then I said it's a 30 cents and then we're getting people clicking.

892
00:51:37,708 --> 00:51:42,272
And as technically those people I'm just breaking even on we're paying for the ads.

893
00:51:42,913 --> 00:51:45,916
And then those people are paying for the ads with, with that purchase.

894
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:51,101
But of course the point is that it's making all the holy algorithms, uh, happier

895
00:51:51,181 --> 00:51:53,944
that we're getting more sales and we're getting more views, which

896
00:51:53,964 --> 00:51:55,545
then organically leads to more.

897
00:51:56,126 --> 00:51:57,747
So in a way we are getting something.

898
00:51:58,348 --> 00:52:01,270
Outside of Reddit ads, it's a massive, massive waste of time.

899
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:06,053
I've seen people, like, oh, I've seen people spend so much money on ads.

900
00:52:06,688 --> 00:52:10,250
I'm not AAA, so maybe in AAA it makes sense.

901
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:15,852
When you see Assassin's Creed plastered all over everything, I'm sure that must make sense

902
00:52:16,172 --> 00:52:18,193
for indie people, god no.

903
00:52:18,493 --> 00:52:25,496
I've seen people pay like $40,000 for a couple of banners at PAX, you know, like those big

904
00:52:25,516 --> 00:52:31,758
hanging banners at PAX, and then when their game comes out I'm like, you've sold about

905
00:52:31,818 --> 00:52:32,539
500 coffees, mate.

906
00:52:32,739 --> 00:52:32,939
Yeah.

907
00:52:33,339 --> 00:52:33,759
Yeah.

908
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:34,519
Yeah.

909
00:52:34,579 --> 00:52:34,840
Yeah.

910
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:42,923
Mike, do you have to rerun that calculation with every new game, or do you have a rate inside that you know roughly, like the CPM is average forward?

911
00:52:42,943 --> 00:52:46,605
You just sort of have to start spending for every game and figure out what the click-through rate is.

912
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:53,266
Yeah, roughly all our games cost the same and roughly have all the same rates.

913
00:52:53,586 --> 00:52:56,769
Or at least if they're not getting the same rates, we work out why not.

914
00:52:57,230 --> 00:52:57,470
Yeah.

915
00:52:57,510 --> 00:53:00,493
We swap some key out, we change the wording, etc.

916
00:53:02,394 --> 00:53:05,357
This is getting extremely close to it sounding like I know what I'm doing.

917
00:53:05,718 --> 00:53:12,043
But yeah, that's the kind of horrible maths that I love playing with every day, really.

918
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,821
Yeah.

919
00:53:15,121 --> 00:53:17,062
So you actually gave a talk in 2018.

920
00:53:17,422 --> 00:53:20,344
And let me get the title right.

921
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:24,125
Making the world give a damn about your game in 2018,

922
00:53:24,165 --> 00:53:27,047
is that about the same as making people give

923
00:53:27,087 --> 00:53:29,108
a damn about your game in 2020?

924
00:53:29,928 --> 00:53:31,989
I mean, certainly things have changed in the last couple

925
00:53:32,009 --> 00:53:32,349
of years.

926
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:34,350
There's some things that have changed.

927
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:37,492
A lot of it is still similar.

928
00:53:37,512 --> 00:53:41,133
I think some of the things that have massively changed for us

929
00:53:42,034 --> 00:53:42,114
are.

930
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:48,755
include stuff that is currently kind of upcoming

931
00:53:48,775 --> 00:53:51,097
and you can feel it in the air coming.

932
00:53:51,197 --> 00:53:53,198
For example, stuff like Game Pass.

933
00:53:54,399 --> 00:53:58,601
Game Pass and other things like Game Pass,

934
00:53:58,621 --> 00:54:00,562
because you know that there's more Game Passes coming.

935
00:54:00,642 --> 00:54:02,163
It's not gonna be the only one, is it?

936
00:54:02,763 --> 00:54:03,504
Netflix appeared,

937
00:54:03,544 --> 00:54:05,025
and then how many other Netflixes appeared?

938
00:54:06,486 --> 00:54:08,026
This is gonna be a model that's gonna be coming,

939
00:54:08,166 --> 00:54:10,168
and it's something that we've had to think about a lot.

940
00:54:11,488 --> 00:54:20,074
We are constantly talking to various different platforms about trying to get these kind of deals,

941
00:54:21,134 --> 00:54:31,040
subscription deals, etc. I would advise everybody to look into these kind of things because I don't

942
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,642
think... I think if you've got the right game for these platforms,

943
00:54:35,743 --> 00:54:37,544
the people behind these platforms are going to care.

944
00:54:38,713 --> 00:54:41,375
And if you don't ask, then you're definitely not going to get on them.

945
00:54:42,155 --> 00:54:46,539
And are you concerned at all that they're going to devalue games over the next like 5-10 years?

946
00:54:48,561 --> 00:54:54,586
Yes, I am. I was a couple of years ago when it started happening.

947
00:54:55,066 --> 00:55:02,732
We started putting games, titles on Game Pass, and I think right now it's fine.

948
00:55:03,373 --> 00:55:07,676
Like right in this moment in time, the money is there.

949
00:55:08,047 --> 00:55:11,909
Like there's the deals are there, et cetera, for it to make sense.

950
00:55:12,109 --> 00:55:14,631
I think all the platforms like Game Pass are going to appear.

951
00:55:14,851 --> 00:55:18,153
We're also going to be offering nice deals, et cetera.

952
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:24,236
The problem comes in a couple of years, two to five years

953
00:55:24,396 --> 00:55:29,358
when there are four services and they've all got every game.

954
00:55:29,779 --> 00:55:31,159
So why do they need your game?

955
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:35,061
But also, if you're not on the service, no one's playing your game.

956
00:55:35,782 --> 00:55:40,387
And the global economy is being rewritten right now with what people's finances look like.

957
00:55:40,468 --> 00:55:44,832
So those two things go hand in hand, I feel like.

958
00:55:45,493 --> 00:55:47,876
Yeah, definitely.

959
00:55:49,698 --> 00:55:54,243
But the thing is that especially with Next Gen about to happen,

960
00:55:55,364 --> 00:55:57,646
I feel like what always happens is whenever there's...

961
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:00,311
A new generation of console.

962
00:56:00,751 --> 00:56:03,534
That sort of kicks everyone up the arse a little bit.

963
00:56:03,554 --> 00:56:06,296
You know, it's all of a sudden, everything's a bit more exciting

964
00:56:06,376 --> 00:56:10,779
and you get that little burst of people caring about the stuff again.

965
00:56:11,019 --> 00:56:16,884
And I especially feel like if we're in an unfortunate circumstance

966
00:56:17,004 --> 00:56:19,846
where what's happening in the world right now is still going on

967
00:56:20,146 --> 00:56:24,449
as these consoles are coming out, which it's seeming like maybe it's going to.

968
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:25,570
What are you referring to?

969
00:56:26,867 --> 00:56:28,529
I don't know, I don't know.

970
00:56:28,669 --> 00:56:35,618
It feels like that might actually really sort of boost that even more.

971
00:56:35,738 --> 00:56:39,683
I mean, everyone's been saying already, right, that video game sales in general have been

972
00:56:40,324 --> 00:56:40,444
up.

973
00:56:40,744 --> 00:56:44,349
I know ours have, since all of this horrible stuff has been happening.

974
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:54,252
I can only assume, I don't know about how it will affect manufacturing of course, but I can only assume that the demand for next-gen is going to be strong.

975
00:56:55,233 --> 00:57:04,959
And so I feel like once that kicks off for the next year or so after that, we're going to see sort of excitement in video games.

976
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:12,461
hype, etc. which passes to everybody, which is good. I think it's good, uh, new next gen. But

977
00:57:12,802 --> 00:57:18,543
so, so yeah, it's video games, isn't it? It's always all over the place. It's always all over

978
00:57:18,583 --> 00:57:22,924
the place. Every year I have the same conversation with the same people at GDC. Oh, video games,

979
00:57:22,944 --> 00:57:29,346
what's gonna happen? It's all over. That way it works. Um, Mike, there is a good question in chat

980
00:57:29,586 --> 00:57:34,367
I think we should get to, but I also want to ask, um, as a person who gives advice, uh, you know,

981
00:57:34,627 --> 00:57:35,187
and just trying to

982
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:39,254
figure out advice and you're sometimes trying to read the bones and like like literally sometimes

983
00:57:39,314 --> 00:57:43,618
doing you know like old pagan magic to figure out if your video game will sell or not um there's

984
00:57:43,638 --> 00:57:47,863
kind of a phenomenon where like advice is good but the problem is the advice is good for the

985
00:57:47,923 --> 00:57:51,106
experience that the advice was already lived through so by the time you're giving it

986
00:57:52,245 --> 00:57:55,968
You know, especially if it's marketing advice, the ground is already changing under you,

987
00:57:56,329 --> 00:57:59,212
which isn't to say like, don't go to Mike's talk, go to Mike's talk.

988
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:03,015
But how have you like adapted to that when talking to your fellow developers and trying

989
00:58:03,055 --> 00:58:05,518
to like jam on these ideas together?

990
00:58:06,139 --> 00:58:09,963
Yeah, you're definitely right. Like a lot of the stuff, I guess it's what we were kind of touching

991
00:58:09,983 --> 00:58:17,151
on a second ago about like, you know, does the talk that I gave in 2018 still work? Yeah, a lot

992
00:58:17,171 --> 00:58:21,877
of this stuff does change very rapidly and especially as there's new platforms coming out.

993
00:58:22,858 --> 00:58:25,780
And, you know, we're talking about, like, subscriptions, et cetera.

994
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:28,801
In the next two years, how many talks about that is going to come out?

995
00:58:28,841 --> 00:58:30,182
And which ones do you listen to?

996
00:58:30,643 --> 00:58:34,125
And, you know, who's just saying nice things about platforms

997
00:58:34,145 --> 00:58:35,746
because they're on them, et cetera?

998
00:58:35,906 --> 00:58:37,587
It's a minefield with this kind of stuff.

999
00:58:38,808 --> 00:58:43,631
I think when you're looking, if someone's looking for advice,

1000
00:58:43,971 --> 00:58:46,773
pretend there's someone listening who their game isn't out for 12 months,

1001
00:58:47,333 --> 00:58:50,715
and they're thinking, I'm going to have to start doing selling stuff in about six months.

1002
00:58:51,457 --> 00:58:58,281
You should definitely in six months at that point, then start to look for recent sales figures,

1003
00:58:58,481 --> 00:59:04,725
recent ways people are selling things, etc. And maybe not completely rely on talks that

1004
00:59:04,765 --> 00:59:08,007
are a year old at that point, because yeah, stuff moves fast.

1005
00:59:08,868 --> 00:59:14,431
Sorry to captain the ship for a second, but for Gabe Pafker's question before we leave here.

1006
00:59:14,787 --> 00:59:19,070
What convention or show strategy would you recommend for small indies with low sales

1007
00:59:19,110 --> 00:59:20,270
budget and expectations?

1008
00:59:20,571 --> 00:59:21,651
You have 30 seconds to answer.

1009
00:59:22,372 --> 00:59:23,632
Do not get a booth.

1010
00:59:26,174 --> 00:59:29,416
When I say that, I really, to be honest, mean at...

1011
00:59:30,897 --> 00:59:31,797
I don't want to say names.

1012
00:59:32,878 --> 00:59:36,080
I mean at one of the big shows where 60,000 gamers turn up.

1013
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:43,523
Those people who see your game are not going to convert into sales or anything

1014
00:59:43,603 --> 00:59:46,565
because they're going to walk past your game or maybe even play a little while

1015
00:59:47,005 --> 00:59:48,006
and then just move on.

1016
00:59:48,726 --> 00:59:51,808
If you are going to go to a show or you're close to a show or whatever,

1017
00:59:52,829 --> 00:59:56,132
just turn up and do meetings with useful people there.

1018
00:59:56,952 --> 01:00:00,054
We've done shows like booth kind of shows.

1019
01:00:00,214 --> 01:00:04,878
And to be honest, we've stopped doing them now because we just haven't seen

1020
01:00:05,458 --> 01:00:07,440
the benefit of those kind of consumer shows, really.

1021
01:00:08,868 --> 01:00:11,489
That was like perfectly timed. Wow.

1022
01:00:12,229 --> 01:00:15,250
We're out of time. I'm gonna hijack and sign us off I guess.

1023
01:00:16,851 --> 01:00:21,892
So as mentioned before, if you want to see some of Mike's outdated talks on how to sell your video game,

1024
01:00:22,312 --> 01:00:24,973
you can find a lot of them for free on the GDC YouTube channel.

1025
01:00:24,993 --> 01:00:27,554
A lot of great content there and then Mike's content there too.

1026
01:00:28,134 --> 01:00:31,435
So there's that. Mike, where should people bother you with questions?

1027
01:00:32,054 --> 01:00:34,135
Oh, you should go on my Twitters.

1028
01:00:34,795 --> 01:00:39,359
I am at rave of Ravendale on the twits.

1029
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:41,140
Hit me.

1030
01:00:42,381 --> 01:00:44,022
Never heard it said out loud before.

1031
01:00:44,502 --> 01:00:45,103
On the twits.

1032
01:00:46,464 --> 01:00:47,424
I tweet horrible things.

1033
01:00:48,525 --> 01:00:49,546
And useful, sometimes.

1034
01:00:51,024 --> 01:00:52,205
One for every five, right? Yeah.

1035
01:00:52,245 --> 01:00:53,446
A lot of horrible tweets.

1036
01:00:54,086 --> 01:00:57,849
You people follow me just to see the horrible thing I'll say next.

1037
01:00:57,929 --> 01:01:00,350
Your advice is so good that they enter the shitpost.

1038
01:01:00,831 --> 01:01:04,053
Yes, exactly. So for the rest of us,

1039
01:01:04,093 --> 01:01:06,654
thank you for joining us for our live podcast episode.

1040
01:01:06,695 --> 01:01:09,857
We have another one tomorrow with Emily Greer, correct?

1041
01:01:09,877 --> 01:01:11,418
Yeah. So we'll see you then.

1042
01:01:11,438 --> 01:01:14,320
Bye. All right. Thanks, everyone. Bye.
