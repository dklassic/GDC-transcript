00:00:01,158 --> 00:00:06,861
Hey everyone, welcome to the GDC Twitch channel. My name is Brian Francis. I am here the

2
00:00:06,861 --> 00:00:11,624
I'm no longer the invisible voice inside your head. I used to be very invisible

3
00:00:11,624 --> 00:00:17,987
But now I am here in front of you with planets all around me on the spirit overlay art

4
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:24,474
Talking to you today about a neat new game called Teardown.

5
00:00:24,474 --> 00:00:30,002
If you're here in chat and I already see some great folks in chat like 4catrpm and xy01design,

6
00:00:30,002 --> 00:00:33,606
you probably know what Teardown is. We've been watching these clips on YouTube for a few weeks,

7
00:00:33,606 --> 00:00:34,868
haven't we? Um...

8
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:38,091
Uh, Tear Down is a game where you tear things down.

9
00:00:38,091 --> 00:00:41,954
It's got these neat voxels, you are pushing and prodding things.

10
00:00:41,954 --> 00:00:46,038
Uh, for those of you in chat, if you're not new here, lately we've been doing this thing

11
00:00:46,038 --> 00:00:50,342
where I record the footage in advance so I can chat with the developer who is down below

12
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:51,383
and we'll get to him in a second.

13
00:00:51,383 --> 00:00:54,706
Uh, so the footage you're seeing today is pre-recorded and you're gonna see me like

14
00:00:54,706 --> 00:00:54,746
it.

15
00:00:54,746 --> 00:00:55,446
So, uh, I'll see you guys later.

16
00:00:55,446 --> 00:00:55,626
Take care.

17
00:00:55,626 --> 00:00:55,687
Bye.

18
00:00:56,049 --> 00:00:59,773
learning the game because we're only playing the first couple hours. You're going to see me having

19
00:00:59,773 --> 00:01:04,597
some pretty like organic reactions to things which we're going to fuel our conversation.

20
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:09,642
But enough about me and my mediocre gameplay skills. I am here with a wonderful person,

21
00:01:09,642 --> 00:01:14,086
Tuxedo Labs himself, Dennis Gustafsson. Dennis, would you please introduce yourself

22
00:01:14,086 --> 00:01:15,127
and tell us how you're doing?

23
00:01:16,773 --> 00:01:24,536
Hi, yes, so I'm Dennis Gustafsson, and I'm one of the main developers of this game Teardown.

24
00:01:24,536 --> 00:01:33,020
I've been working on it for almost three years, at least two and a half years, full time.

25
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:38,042
And it started off as a solo project, but it grew into a small team,

26
00:01:38,042 --> 00:01:42,944
and we're now two main developers, that's myself and Emil Bengtsson.

27
00:01:42,944 --> 00:01:44,985
And then we have a number of contractors.

28
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,324
I think we've been seven people involved in creating this game.

29
00:01:51,324 --> 00:01:53,527
And it's currently in early access on Steam.

30
00:01:53,527 --> 00:01:59,233
And we're going to work for at least another year, we've said,

31
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:04,319
to build more content for it and add mod support and fix bugs

32
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,222
and whatever community, based on the feedback

33
00:02:07,222 --> 00:02:08,623
that we get from the community.

34
00:02:09,385 --> 00:02:16,913
Sweet, I, uh, I, uh, what I take out of that is, oh sweet, we can have this conversation again in a year again and talk about what you've learned in that time.

35
00:02:16,913 --> 00:02:17,013
Yes!

36
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:25,443
But yeah, uh, Teardown! So, uh, you can see me going through the tutorial right here, like learning the basic mechanics and getting to the first mission, which I'm going to spend way too much time on, uh, today.

37
00:02:25,683 --> 00:02:31,447
But Dennis, I would like you to sort of tell us, what were the origins of Tear Down and how, like,

38
00:02:31,447 --> 00:02:35,309
I've seen games like this sort of come and go, you know, like the post-Minecraft boom was like,

39
00:02:35,309 --> 00:02:41,313
oh, voxels and crafting and building, like, were very big, but this is a game, instead of building

40
00:02:41,313 --> 00:02:45,616
things up, you tear them down. So what, where did this game come from, and what were kind of

41
00:02:45,616 --> 00:02:50,079
the first things that emerged that made you go, oh, we have a fun game here, we should keep

42
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:52,360
developing this and try to make it into a full-fledged thing?

43
00:02:53,939 --> 00:03:01,644
It's actually a pretty long story, because this game started as just a technology experiment.

44
00:03:01,644 --> 00:03:07,728
Most of my previous games also started with some kind of thing with technology,

45
00:03:07,728 --> 00:03:15,293
like playing around with something new. And this was very much one of those games where

46
00:03:15,293 --> 00:03:21,257
I started tinkering with... I actually started with a rendering, like doing a custom ray tracing.

47
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:34,382
by art style. Very inspired by the Magicka voxel community. I don't know if you're aware of that.

48
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:42,485
It's a little voxel modeling and rendering software. And I really like this style of blending

49
00:03:42,485 --> 00:03:49,588
abstract voxels with super realistic lighting and the combination of that.

50
00:03:49,588 --> 00:03:56,191
And then I also have a history of making destruction for games. I've been working with

51
00:03:59,316 --> 00:04:05,901
Or been part of doing games with destruction before most notably is the mobile game smash hit

52
00:04:05,901 --> 00:04:14,848
It's also based on destruction. So I was playing on this technology and voxels is very suitable for

53
00:04:21,326 --> 00:04:24,708
because they're just so much easier to work with when destroying stuff.

54
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:30,772
And also with the physics, it really works well together.

55
00:04:30,772 --> 00:04:36,396
So we had this little sandbox playground where you could just run around and

56
00:04:36,396 --> 00:04:40,099
destroy voxel objects and then turning that

57
00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:43,601
into a game was a pretty long process where

58
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:45,142
I was prototyping stuff.

59
00:04:49,575 --> 00:04:55,838
trying out different types of gameplay, but we didn't really find anything suitable,

60
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:59,460
and then I continued doing that on my own for another almost half year,

61
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:06,123
before finally landing in this two-phase heist-type game.

62
00:05:06,123 --> 00:05:07,424
Yeah.

63
00:05:07,424 --> 00:05:15,708
Because what's fun with this was to really use destruction for the gameplay,

64
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:18,389
where you can do more of a precision work,

65
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:24,141
as opposed to just having destruction as an effect, as you typically see in games.

66
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:31,405
But that also meant it was pretty hard to find a suitable gameplay or game idea

67
00:05:31,405 --> 00:05:38,728
under the assumption that everything should be destructible, because a lot of...

68
00:05:39,263 --> 00:05:45,147
traditional game designs and the tools we use for level design and game design in general,

69
00:05:45,147 --> 00:05:46,948
they don't really work.

70
00:05:46,948 --> 00:05:52,752
They kind of break down when everything is destructible because you can't really restrict

71
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:55,293
the player with walls, doors, and all this stuff.

72
00:05:55,293 --> 00:05:56,774
So it was a long project.

73
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:59,536
It was a long process to end up in this type of game.

74
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:04,197
Yeah, let's talk about the first level that we see here. We've got folks in chat.

75
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:10,804
I think there's some people pointing something out. Andy the Noquee says they're amazed they

76
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:15,788
could play a game with ray tracing on their 1060. I'm running on this in like a 970,

77
00:06:15,788 --> 00:06:20,793
so if you think this game looks good, it's running on my old graphics card.

78
00:06:20,793 --> 00:06:23,216
I'm trying to get a 3070, but so is everyone else. Anyway.

79
00:06:23,496 --> 00:06:26,099
Um, so, uh, this level is interesting.

80
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:29,902
What I experienced in this level, what we're watching me do in real time is sort of learning,

81
00:06:29,902 --> 00:06:36,228
I'm learning how the destruction in this game works, um, and how, uh, how I'm supposed to

82
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:40,232
complete this objective, which is that this building is, uh, oh, it's just 6.3 meters too

83
00:06:40,232 --> 00:06:44,617
tall. Uh, my dumb American self does not know what a meter is, so I don't know that means

84
00:06:44,617 --> 00:06:48,220
tear down the building. I'm sitting here thinking I just need to knock a few inches off the top.

85
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:55,242
Um, uh, and, and it's not once it, once you understand it, it is straightforward.

86
00:06:55,242 --> 00:06:59,163
But as you saw me do a few minutes ago, I was, I tore down like all the walls in

87
00:06:59,163 --> 00:07:01,643
the building and I looked up and the whole building standing up and I'm like,

88
00:07:01,643 --> 00:07:03,684
okay, well, what the heck am I supposed to like, what am I doing?

89
00:07:03,684 --> 00:07:05,424
Like how, what is blowing up?

90
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:08,545
Like there's, there's a game logic here that is very interesting

91
00:07:08,545 --> 00:07:10,025
and ties into that destruction.

92
00:07:10,025 --> 00:07:13,046
Um, what were sort of your process for building?

93
00:07:13,046 --> 00:07:15,086
Like, and this is the level where the player is learning it, right?

94
00:07:15,086 --> 00:07:17,707
Like this is the tutorial in a sense.

95
00:07:17,707 --> 00:07:18,107
Um,

96
00:07:18,607 --> 00:07:27,252
Yeah, no, that's... I see what you're meaning, that the destruction doesn't really feel the weight of the building.

97
00:07:27,252 --> 00:07:31,155
It can be held up by a very small piece of the building.

98
00:07:31,155 --> 00:07:35,417
And that is, first and foremost, it's a technical limitation.

99
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:43,002
It's just like, if I should simulate stress in every part of the building the entire time, that would just be too...

100
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,482
time-consuming to do in real time.

101
00:07:46,482 --> 00:07:49,704
So that's the main reason for it.

102
00:07:49,704 --> 00:07:53,487
And the reason we put...

103
00:07:53,487 --> 00:08:01,234
We talked about putting another type of house, because we can also do other types of destruction

104
00:08:01,234 --> 00:08:06,498
where this is kind of hidden by jointing stuff and having more like wiggly buildings.

105
00:08:06,498 --> 00:08:11,942
But it was sort of honest to be upfront, like this is...

106
00:08:18,035 --> 00:08:21,600
and that all the other beliefs don't work that way.

107
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,326
So it was kind of an informed decision to make it that way.

108
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:34,928
Yeah, I think this tutorial is interesting because unlike other tutorial levels that are very like everything is set out and you just do exactly what the game tells you.

109
00:08:34,928 --> 00:08:40,090
Which, you know, the section before this was like that, but this is very like, oh no, you're going to feel lost.

110
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:47,253
If you haven't watched any videos, you're going to feel lost and confused for a bit until it clicks, and we're going to watch in real time me processing it clicking.

111
00:08:47,253 --> 00:08:53,935
So I think that's a very interesting way. I know you're in early access, so maybe this will change later on, but...

112
00:08:54,355 --> 00:08:56,357
That's kind of an interesting way to put it.

113
00:08:56,357 --> 00:09:05,122
I think it's kind of like the idea, and I get what you're saying, that it's a very open-ended solution for being a tutorial level.

114
00:09:05,122 --> 00:09:08,665
But that kind of reflects the whole game, I think.

115
00:09:08,665 --> 00:09:13,648
There is no set solution to any part of the game.

116
00:09:13,648 --> 00:09:17,931
So I feel personally this worked out pretty well as a tutorial level.

117
00:09:17,931 --> 00:09:22,013
Especially since now I see you running out of propane tanks here.

118
00:09:22,013 --> 00:09:24,255
And that's also supposed to...

119
00:09:27,694 --> 00:09:31,236
to kind of figure out what to do when you run out of them.

120
00:09:31,236 --> 00:09:33,737
And there are multiple ways you can bring it down

121
00:09:33,737 --> 00:09:34,598
in other ways.

122
00:09:34,598 --> 00:09:35,638
There's only five, huh?

123
00:09:35,638 --> 00:09:37,939
We're about to find out how I solve that problem.

124
00:09:37,939 --> 00:09:41,881
Going to chat, let's grab a X-Y-O-1 designs model.

125
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:45,683
I-K-I-Y is calling me out here like,

126
00:09:45,683 --> 00:09:47,885
what, it's pretty straightforward.

127
00:09:47,885 --> 00:09:51,766
Just take down the base of the house till it collapses.

128
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:57,048
Do I look like a smart person? I'm here. I'm doing this. I don't know. I don't know.

129
00:09:57,048 --> 00:10:03,850
Anyway, xy01design would like to know, their question is any insight on the voxel data model?

130
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:10,292
Is there anything you'd like to share? I sort of don't know how to ask that question in a way,

131
00:10:10,292 --> 00:10:13,193
because I don't know a lot about voxels and modeling voxels,

132
00:10:13,193 --> 00:10:16,654
but is there anything you'd like to share about how the voxel modeling in this game works?

133
00:10:17,423 --> 00:10:20,084
Yeah, I don't know how technical we should get in this stream, but it is...

134
00:10:20,084 --> 00:10:27,427
The whole engine is built from ground up to do just these voxel environments.

135
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:33,549
So it's a custom engine that's designed entirely for this.

136
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:39,692
And I think what I do differently from most other voxel engines is...

137
00:10:39,692 --> 00:10:44,593
Most other voxel engines, including Minecraft, has this axis-aligned world.

138
00:10:48,045 --> 00:10:54,009
I have, instead of just one big volume of billions of voxels,

139
00:10:54,009 --> 00:10:57,471
I have thousands of smaller volumes

140
00:10:57,471 --> 00:10:58,591
that are filled with voxels.

141
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,472
So each object has its own,

142
00:11:00,472 --> 00:11:03,234
everything's straight within its own volume,

143
00:11:03,234 --> 00:11:05,155
but I have very many of them instead.

144
00:11:05,155 --> 00:11:09,718
And I think that's the main difference.

145
00:11:09,718 --> 00:11:11,819
Other than that, it's pretty similar

146
00:11:11,819 --> 00:11:15,361
to how other voxel engines store their data.

147
00:11:15,361 --> 00:11:16,242
It's just like a big.

148
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:31,539
Gotcha. For folks in chat, if you have any follow-up questions on that, like I said, this is just something I know less about, but we're taking chat questions if you want to know how this game got made.

149
00:11:31,539 --> 00:11:33,561
Ask them. Viper actually has a pretty good one.

150
00:11:33,561 --> 00:11:43,470
What computer did you build on to iterate the performance? Did you start on a regular to mid-level CPU or GPU, or did you have a high-end PC and then slowly optimize it?

151
00:11:45,862 --> 00:11:56,112
I had a high-end PC when I started and I still have the same PC which is now kind of yeah now

152
00:11:56,112 --> 00:12:01,797
It's not high-end mid-range. I would say it's it's a core i7

153
00:12:01,797 --> 00:12:04,399
Quad-core processor and a 1080 DTX 1080 graphics card and

154
00:12:06,496 --> 00:12:11,117
I used that as a target and then trying to get it a little,

155
00:12:11,117 --> 00:12:15,537
trying to run really smoothly on that one and then it's gonna run on a 1070

156
00:12:15,537 --> 00:12:22,819
quite okay also. But then because you can tweak the

157
00:12:22,819 --> 00:12:26,259
settings a little bit it actually turned out to run on slower

158
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:30,680
hardware as well. That came more as a surprise to me. I never

159
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,801
thought this would run on a 970 for instance

160
00:12:33,801 --> 00:12:35,861
but it turns out it actually did.

161
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:43,895
Apparently according to chat it runs on a 772 so that's a good job.

162
00:12:43,895 --> 00:12:49,017
That person actually is Josh Duffity Wong who says they're impressed that the game came

163
00:12:49,017 --> 00:12:53,478
with so much of a campaign with mission progression and update system even though it's in early

164
00:12:53,478 --> 00:12:53,898
access.

165
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:56,960
That brings us to, yeah, we can talk about early access.

166
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,483
What was sort of your, once you realized that this game was coming along, that like, okay, it's fun,

167
00:13:01,483 --> 00:13:05,585
like, the core, like, you know, you can set up a house and tearing down the house is fun.

168
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:09,087
What was your process for saying, okay, we're going to ship in early access,

169
00:13:09,087 --> 00:13:12,329
but early access is going to have this much content at launch,

170
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:15,411
and then we're going to plan out more for the full launch.

171
00:13:15,411 --> 00:13:17,912
Like, what was sort of your measuring stick for figuring out,

172
00:13:17,912 --> 00:13:19,373
we can do this and still call it early access?

173
00:13:19,373 --> 00:13:20,053
Yeah, it's a good question.

174
00:13:20,053 --> 00:13:20,073
I...

175
00:13:26,487 --> 00:13:33,691
done a lot of mobile games before, but launching something on Steam and for PC is quite different

176
00:13:33,691 --> 00:13:40,996
and we didn't really have any experience from that. So we kind of had to iterate on that a

177
00:13:40,996 --> 00:13:47,560
little bit, what the early access should be. And I think all of us thought that we would release

178
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:53,244
something smaller in early access. We talked about having maybe two hours worth of gameplay and

179
00:13:53,244 --> 00:13:54,425
something along those lines.

180
00:13:55,675 --> 00:14:04,608
then it kind of grew and we also found out during playtesting that the campaign took

181
00:14:04,608 --> 00:14:09,375
people way longer than we thought it would.

182
00:14:14,193 --> 00:14:14,934
Mm-hmm.

183
00:14:14,934 --> 00:14:16,295
At first.

184
00:14:16,295 --> 00:14:17,836
But it's not easy.

185
00:14:17,836 --> 00:14:24,801
I think this game has had a pretty big crowd on Twitter for a couple of years, and I think

186
00:14:24,801 --> 00:14:30,606
we could have put something out there much earlier, but it's also about setting the expectations,

187
00:14:30,606 --> 00:14:32,927
I guess, what the game will be.

188
00:14:32,927 --> 00:14:37,651
We didn't really want to launch until we could show.

189
00:14:47,673 --> 00:14:53,378
out that this wasn't really the way we wanted to make stuff and try to change

190
00:14:53,378 --> 00:14:58,503
that you're gonna disappoint at least 50% of the people and then yeah but we

191
00:14:58,503 --> 00:15:03,167
also wanted to release early because we that's something we decided very early

192
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:06,990
on in the project of this would be perfect for a really early early access

193
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:12,214
where we can actually take a lot of suggestions from people because this is

194
00:15:12,214 --> 00:15:15,837
new technology and new game mechanics and

195
00:15:21,174 --> 00:15:23,919
So we didn't want to make too much or have it too finished.

196
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:32,797
And that's when we decided on this, releasing the first chapter, the first part, so to say.

197
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:36,617
Gotcha, for folks in chat, there are some folks saying, yeah, go drive the vehicles.

198
00:15:36,617 --> 00:15:38,798
I didn't know you could drive the vehicles yet at this point.

199
00:15:38,798 --> 00:15:44,902
Like I said, this was- so every time I watch myself walk by the construction vehicles, I just cringe.

200
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:48,784
Um, so no, unfortunately you're about to see me get frustrated and reload the level one more time.

201
00:15:48,784 --> 00:15:51,826
Uh, but you know, that's how it is. We got some other stuff.

202
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:54,527
But we can actually go back to talking about some of the- uh, actually-

203
00:15:54,707 --> 00:15:59,089
No, that's a lie. I want to talk about level design because it gets really interesting.

204
00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:00,930
But, um, we have some good questions in chat.

205
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,471
Um, Rex- Guys, y'all are great with the questions today, by the way.

206
00:16:03,471 --> 00:16:05,953
Um, uh, Rex Cortex would like to know,

207
00:16:05,953 --> 00:16:08,014
what parts of the game run as Lua scripts,

208
00:16:08,014 --> 00:16:11,595
and is it possible to mod game logic that's not part of Lua scripts?

209
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:15,677
You and I were just talking beforehand about how, um,

210
00:16:15,677 --> 00:16:18,018
you're getting more modding available for this game.

211
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,519
You're working on getting that ready right now.

212
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,300
Uh, why not talk about Lua scripts, and then we can talk more about modding.

213
00:16:23,045 --> 00:16:33,015
Yeah, that's something we started adding maybe half a year ago or a little bit more maybe,

214
00:16:33,015 --> 00:16:41,243
that we moved over a lot of the game logic from C++ to LuaScript and that's because we knew that

215
00:16:41,243 --> 00:16:43,845
this would be a fun game to mod. We got a lot of

216
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,531
all kinds of games with it.

217
00:16:48,531 --> 00:16:54,075
So we kind of knew that we wanted to make this a moddable game early on, and that's

218
00:16:54,075 --> 00:16:58,038
when we started to rip stuff out of C++ and putting it in Lua instead.

219
00:16:58,038 --> 00:17:03,122
And I think it was a really good decision, not just for the modding aspect, but it also

220
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,944
helped developing the game a lot, I think.

221
00:17:05,944 --> 00:17:12,569
So we have all the simulation is running in C++, and pretty much all the gameplay is in

222
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:12,689
Lua.

223
00:17:14,047 --> 00:17:20,391
I'm rewriting parts of that now to make it easier to modify.

224
00:17:20,391 --> 00:17:27,616
But the goal, and I think we're almost there already, is that you should be able to make

225
00:17:27,616 --> 00:17:32,659
an entire new game mechanic based on the same engine.

226
00:17:32,659 --> 00:17:36,182
You can make a new game basically as a mod to this game.

227
00:17:36,182 --> 00:17:37,142
That's the goal.

228
00:17:37,142 --> 00:17:41,645
I think it's going to take a few iterations before we're really...

229
00:17:41,682 --> 00:17:50,006
there and more specifically we're gonna have to release the level editor for that and that's in

230
00:17:50,006 --> 00:17:57,309
it's not in great shape at the moment so i had to clean that up a little bit um but yeah Lua is

231
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:04,873
great i i think it's a a great scripting language and it's also technically i i've made it so that

232
00:18:09,543 --> 00:18:11,444
but they're all kind of isolated.

233
00:18:11,444 --> 00:18:14,106
So it's pretty easy to go in and write another one

234
00:18:14,106 --> 00:18:15,887
and modify the game a little bit.

235
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:17,869
And we're going to release some examples of that

236
00:18:17,869 --> 00:18:21,371
when we release this improved mod support.

237
00:18:21,371 --> 00:18:27,716
But there are certain things like how things break

238
00:18:27,716 --> 00:18:31,098
and how vehicles handle and stuff like that.

239
00:18:31,098 --> 00:18:32,880
It's not going to be moddable.

240
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,943
But everything that is related to how scores are calculated,

241
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:45,715
works, what the levels look like, and what the goal is, and all these things are going

242
00:18:45,715 --> 00:18:47,057
to be moddable and descriptable.

243
00:18:47,057 --> 00:18:54,343
Syphal would like to know, why did you decide to use SSR for reflection color instead of

244
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:55,745
full path tracing?

245
00:18:55,745 --> 00:18:57,346
It's just the performance.

246
00:18:58,852 --> 00:19:06,817
The ray tracing in Teardown is very special or very different from how ray tracing is normally done.

247
00:19:06,817 --> 00:19:12,422
Since everything is voxels, ray tracing becomes much cheaper.

248
00:19:12,422 --> 00:19:16,104
I could just do it with some acceleration structure.

249
00:19:16,104 --> 00:19:24,110
I think I could do the ray tracing with the same objects that are rendered to the scene, but that's not the case right now.

250
00:19:24,683 --> 00:19:29,925
So I actually have a separate voxel structure

251
00:19:29,925 --> 00:19:35,346
just with the 3D occlusion data, so to speak,

252
00:19:35,346 --> 00:19:37,047
where I perform the ray tracing.

253
00:19:37,047 --> 00:19:40,668
That also means I don't have access to any colors

254
00:19:40,668 --> 00:19:42,269
in that data structure.

255
00:19:42,269 --> 00:19:45,530
So it's not technically possible for me

256
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:50,812
to do full path tracing with that method I've chosen.

257
00:19:50,812 --> 00:19:53,032
But that also makes it very fast,

258
00:19:53,032 --> 00:19:54,493
so it can run on older hardware.

259
00:19:55,076 --> 00:19:57,917
I briefly had to pause the game here while I was handling something.

260
00:19:57,917 --> 00:19:59,558
A package person came to the door, and you know how it is.

261
00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:00,039
We're all locked in.

262
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:01,920
We're all in quarantine.

263
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:06,163
We have to, we had to go, I had to, you know, UPS comes, they're delivering something important.

264
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:11,326
I had a big smile on my face because I was just watching the house wobble and remembering

265
00:20:11,326 --> 00:20:12,907
what it felt like to go, I'm finally doing it!

266
00:20:12,907 --> 00:20:16,849
Like, I'm finally blowing up this house!

267
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:19,071
What technique do you use for the collision?

268
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:24,114
Is it regular mesh mesh, or is it voxel versus voxel on the CPU or the GPU?

269
00:20:24,913 --> 00:20:26,755
I can't believe I understand that.

270
00:20:26,755 --> 00:20:29,737
Yeah, this is becoming a technical stream.

271
00:20:29,737 --> 00:20:31,759
I like that.

272
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:34,222
It's all voxel versus voxel.

273
00:20:34,222 --> 00:20:36,043
There are no triangles in this game.

274
00:20:36,043 --> 00:20:39,867
Everything is volumetric data.

275
00:20:39,867 --> 00:20:44,812
Except for water surfaces and these power lines that you see.

276
00:20:44,812 --> 00:20:46,373
Those are the two exceptions.

277
00:20:47,056 --> 00:20:56,886
But yeah, both the physics and the rendering is all performed directly on volumetric voxel data, so no triangles or polygons.

278
00:20:56,886 --> 00:20:59,589
And the physics happen on the CPU and all the rendering.

279
00:21:03,377 --> 00:21:05,898
is on their GPU.

280
00:21:28,326 --> 00:21:31,347
I could totally do this more efficiently, but at this point I'm chopping down the house

281
00:21:31,347 --> 00:21:35,209
because I'm like, I get it, I get it, I'm so close, I'm like, I'm just mashing my mouse.

282
00:21:35,209 --> 00:21:42,613
As a game designer, in a game like this, the player needs to have some kind of understanding

283
00:21:42,613 --> 00:21:43,373
about how things work.

284
00:21:43,373 --> 00:21:47,796
We talked about the tutorial, here I am going, oh no, the chimney is something too tall.

285
00:21:48,616 --> 00:21:52,319
What are your kind of thoughts around like designing for like frustration versus aha,

286
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:56,241
like we're going to see as the next levels unfold like what the objectives are and like the more

287
00:21:56,241 --> 00:22:01,285
aha moments that I encounter. But like what is your kind of like, like you said, like you

288
00:22:01,285 --> 00:22:05,428
designed everything to be so open ended, like how do you like account for players who like,

289
00:22:05,428 --> 00:22:09,251
might be so frustrated that they have to go look up a guy like like what are your sort of thoughts

290
00:22:09,251 --> 00:22:16,476
about how you work around player expectations in that space? Yeah, I see what you mean. And I think

291
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:25,145
There could be a certain amount of frustration in this game, or I know there is, especially in the beginning,

292
00:22:25,145 --> 00:22:30,086
but that's not something we intentionally wanted in the game.

293
00:22:30,086 --> 00:22:34,088
It's more out of necessity, I would say.

294
00:22:34,088 --> 00:22:36,789
We wanted the player to start with a very basic...

295
00:22:40,775 --> 00:22:46,338
the players with all the tools and we wanted to be able to reward players with new tools

296
00:22:46,338 --> 00:22:47,499
for completing missions.

297
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:55,805
But I think the frustration mostly comes from a resource limitation and that's something

298
00:22:55,805 --> 00:23:03,170
we also noticed when prototyping other game ideas that we had for example a puzzle game

299
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:07,873
that was also a heist game where but the difficulty

300
00:23:10,728 --> 00:23:16,669
the goods and rather not the planning an optimal route.

301
00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:23,151
But having... And for that to work, you had to have a very limited amount of resources,

302
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:26,691
like two bombs, four shells and the shotgun.

303
00:23:26,691 --> 00:23:31,773
And the game just doesn't become fun with all these limitations.

304
00:23:31,773 --> 00:23:38,634
So I think a way to get around that was to pretty quickly ramp up the resources.

305
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,942
in the beginning of the game.

306
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:11,768
It's specifically it's on the rise in specific ways like you know like it's not it's not um

307
00:24:11,768 --> 00:24:14,010
It doesn't feel like it's you know like age of Empires mod

308
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:19,976
You know like like modding from like 1998 or whatever we use the in-game editor to make stuff, but at the same time like

309
00:24:19,976 --> 00:24:24,600
I've been playing a lot more games where I pop into the workshop, and I'm like again

310
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,462
I'm not in this world very much, but I

311
00:24:27,903 --> 00:24:32,606
I feel like like modding has enabled something very specific in PC games

312
00:24:32,606 --> 00:24:37,449
Well game development as a whole has had to you know survive in the market figure out how to support consoles

313
00:24:37,449 --> 00:24:42,693
You know like I play Skyrim on almost every device that doesn't have mods and like in a very unmodded way

314
00:24:42,693 --> 00:24:47,877
But like that's that's you know one of the industry's longest modding things at this point that is not a question

315
00:24:47,877 --> 00:24:50,159
That was just me opining

316
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,521
I love that this next oh, no you you're about to say something go ahead and say it

317
00:24:54,886 --> 00:24:57,728
Yeah, I'm not a modder myself, I've never been.

318
00:24:57,728 --> 00:25:04,193
I know Emil has been modding a little bit, but we're really curious what people will

319
00:25:04,193 --> 00:25:09,557
do with it, because we have, or I at least have this idea that modding for Teardown will

320
00:25:09,557 --> 00:25:18,303
not be so much about modifying the game as it will be building new content, new mini-games

321
00:25:18,303 --> 00:25:21,665
and new challenges with new gameplay.

322
00:25:23,381 --> 00:25:27,472
for the game, but we don't know, so I guess we'll find out.

323
00:25:28,578 --> 00:25:32,401
Um, I thought it was so interesting that this level, like, when I first booted it up, I was like,

324
00:25:32,401 --> 00:25:37,523
okay, how complicated is this? What is this going to be? Like, what? And I looked at it and I thought,

325
00:25:37,523 --> 00:25:40,445
wait, I can do that. And you're going to see me, like, I'm just going to knock this out in a few

326
00:25:40,445 --> 00:25:44,407
minutes. And then I love that you immediately return to this level. Um, and go, okay, you know

327
00:25:44,407 --> 00:25:48,890
the space. Now you have to navigate it with these limitations. And even then it's not as hard as I,

328
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:53,592
as I thought it was going to be when I started. There's just like, this is such a good learning

329
00:25:53,592 --> 00:25:55,993
space that this level creates. Um.

330
00:25:56,294 --> 00:26:00,237
What are your thoughts of like, like you said, like, the objectives are open-ended,

331
00:26:00,237 --> 00:26:04,139
but there's still a teaching component in the design somewhere, you know, like,

332
00:26:04,139 --> 00:26:08,803
what are your thoughts about like teaching players how to understand these very open-ended rulesets?

333
00:26:08,803 --> 00:26:17,149
Yeah, I think we do, the previous one you played, this one, and the next one I would say are

334
00:26:17,149 --> 00:26:24,595
considered like tutorial missions, and maybe the fourth one also in some ways.

335
00:26:26,174 --> 00:26:35,420
But yeah, I think since this is new gameplay that hasn't really been done before, I think

336
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:45,007
it's quite important to kind of ease the player into, especially easing players into the freedom

337
00:26:45,007 --> 00:26:51,571
you have, because I've seen a lot of players doing playtesting, going up to door and see

338
00:26:51,571 --> 00:26:55,694
if the door is locked and then start looking for other ways instead of just taking...

339
00:26:56,923 --> 00:26:58,584
a vehicle driving through the door.

340
00:26:58,584 --> 00:26:58,865
Yeah.

341
00:26:58,865 --> 00:27:07,390
And you have, you need to think in a certain way that's usually not allowed in other games.

342
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:14,334
And if you play a lot of other games, it can happen that players are a little restricted

343
00:27:14,334 --> 00:27:16,995
in their mindset of what's possible.

344
00:27:19,111 --> 00:27:21,832
I think that's what we're watching, like, we're watching me do it right now.

345
00:27:21,832 --> 00:27:24,793
Like, I am learning how to think, create.

346
00:27:24,793 --> 00:27:25,253
Oh yeah.

347
00:27:25,253 --> 00:27:29,215
I love this part where I'm like, uh, like you can watch me like, Oh, look, Oh, like

348
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:30,415
love this.

349
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:38,739
Um, uh, and I think in a lot of places, like this SkyLift is, is very specifically

350
00:27:38,739 --> 00:27:41,400
put there to help people get up to the platform.

351
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,180
Yeah.

352
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,661
Uh, but it's not, it's only in these.

353
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:52,927
first couple of levels that that's the case. In most other missions we did not put stuff specifically for

354
00:27:52,927 --> 00:28:01,954
to help people perform something in a way that we thought was the right way to do stuff

355
00:28:01,954 --> 00:28:08,340
because we wanted to to have everyone come up with their own ideas.

356
00:28:09,394 --> 00:28:15,698
Um, going into chat, uh, extra murder would like to know any features you wanted but already have had to cut

357
00:28:15,698 --> 00:28:16,578
Sorry, what was that question? Oh, excuse me

358
00:28:16,578 --> 00:28:23,582
They want to know are there any features that you wanted to implement but you've already had to cut because either they weren't fun

359
00:28:23,582 --> 00:28:24,923
Or they took up too many resources

360
00:28:24,923 --> 00:28:27,504
uh, there's

361
00:28:27,504 --> 00:28:34,128
Two I come to think about one is that uh for a long time we talked about an inventory

362
00:28:34,128 --> 00:28:36,949
That you should be able to pick up stuff and you have this

363
00:28:37,512 --> 00:28:44,074
While you were out on a mission you could pick up stuff put in inventory and then when you got back to the hub

364
00:28:44,074 --> 00:28:46,395
Where you live like your workspace?

365
00:28:46,395 --> 00:28:49,615
You could use that to decorate the hub and that will be persistent

366
00:28:49,615 --> 00:28:55,577
And I think we got a lot of requests for that

367
00:28:55,577 --> 00:28:55,717
But

368
00:28:55,717 --> 00:29:03,239
We never implemented it because there were so many issues with having a persistent hub

369
00:29:03,871 --> 00:29:13,740
that if you put something on fire or you tear down the whole place and just how that works.

370
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:17,683
And then we also had this idea about a progression in the hub.

371
00:29:17,683 --> 00:29:29,093
I don't know if you played so far that you really noticed that things are kind of happening in the hub while you're out doing your missions and then come back to visualize that the time has passed.

372
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:36,021
introduce things in the hub, like small little details, and that would also be pretty tricky

373
00:29:36,021 --> 00:29:38,002
if the hub was persistent.

374
00:29:38,002 --> 00:29:45,684
And the other one is, you mentioned that you come back to the same locations a couple of

375
00:29:45,684 --> 00:29:48,285
times, or we have multiple missions in the same locations.

376
00:29:48,285 --> 00:29:53,066
That's something we initially wanted to do much more of.

377
00:29:55,107 --> 00:30:00,771
Like we wanted bigger changes and especially more of a progression like you can see here.

378
00:30:00,771 --> 00:30:04,594
And now that you came back, you had the gate is locked.

379
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:11,979
And there are some signs up and you can see that there is a little truck over there delivering

380
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:15,522
new bars for the windows that were previously open and stuff like that.

381
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:21,146
And this kind of environmental storytelling is something we really wanted to do much,

382
00:30:21,146 --> 00:30:23,207
much more of, and also I'm involved.

383
00:30:23,707 --> 00:30:33,599
Instead of just time of day, we wanted to change the season and have much more things

384
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:37,684
happening and more of a progression to the environment as you come back to them.

385
00:30:37,684 --> 00:30:42,350
And also an initial idea was to have some procedural...

386
00:30:44,273 --> 00:30:50,439
changes to the environment based on what you did in your previous visit.

387
00:30:50,439 --> 00:30:55,845
So if you tore down a wall, it still needs to be a wall for the game to function,

388
00:30:55,845 --> 00:31:02,532
but you could see that they had kind of patched it up and stuff like that.

389
00:31:02,532 --> 00:31:06,256
And I really liked that idea, but it was just not possible.

390
00:31:10,188 --> 00:31:15,190
It would require a lot of new technology also to make that possible.

391
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:18,551
Chat, you're still asking some great questions, I will get back to them.

392
00:31:18,551 --> 00:31:21,712
I think we can talk about narrative design here.

393
00:31:21,712 --> 00:31:23,852
This is a really interesting game.

394
00:31:23,852 --> 00:31:25,433
I don't come to games like this usually.

395
00:31:25,433 --> 00:31:28,633
I'm a very, I like storytelling games in general kind of person.

396
00:31:28,633 --> 00:31:32,354
So when I got into this game and the simple stakes of,

397
00:31:32,354 --> 00:31:35,375
oh, you accidentally did a crime, you must now do more crime.

398
00:31:36,276 --> 00:31:42,498
And there's like a fairly involved for some reason I felt like I was in the UK when I was playing this even though like

399
00:31:42,498 --> 00:31:46,799
That's a fantasy fantasy, but maybe that's because we've had the crown season 4 on in my house

400
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,300
and maybe I'm just in that space but um I

401
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:57,183
There's like just like the the lightest flavor of narrative design and world-building that I really enjoy with this game

402
00:31:57,183 --> 00:32:03,585
Which is you know like it's the missions you get I appreciate the little detail that your computer screen is not voxels like it's this very

403
00:32:04,225 --> 00:32:08,150
straightforward interface that feels approachable in this world.

404
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,931
You know, when you're like, oh, everything's voxel.

405
00:32:09,931 --> 00:32:11,193
She's like, okay, I understand this.

406
00:32:11,193 --> 00:32:12,274
I understand text messages.

407
00:32:12,274 --> 00:32:16,818
Like, um, uh, and there's all these like little, like you pop into a room.

408
00:32:16,818 --> 00:32:20,262
Like I remember where, uh, when I returned to the factory, I'll see

409
00:32:20,262 --> 00:32:22,965
like, I don't think I pointed out again, but there was like, you know,

410
00:32:22,965 --> 00:32:24,506
beakers on a table at one point.

411
00:32:24,506 --> 00:32:27,509
And I was like, like, like there's stuff like these places feel lived in.

412
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:47,201
I could see a lot, when I play a lot of voxel games and they're doing environments like this, I feel like either, unless there's like something specific like a modder who remakes a specific city, or like, you know, there's an element of like let the proceduralism or let the chaos kind of define the space, but here like things feel so curated.

413
00:32:47,201 --> 00:32:51,823
And I'm curious what you and your teammates thought about like making these spaces that feel lived in.

414
00:32:51,823 --> 00:32:52,984
Because they really do.

415
00:32:52,984 --> 00:32:55,786
I heard that comment before and I...

416
00:32:56,323 --> 00:33:03,544
actually quite surprised because we are not particularly happy. I think we anticipated a lot

417
00:33:03,544 --> 00:33:11,366
more of that. So the... It was kind of rushed, the whole putting up props in these environments and

418
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:19,168
making it look like someone works there or lives there is something we would have wanted to spend

419
00:33:19,168 --> 00:33:24,709
at least another couple of months on to really... And especially the progression. You can do a lot

420
00:33:24,709 --> 00:33:24,869
of...

421
00:33:25,982 --> 00:33:31,786
storytelling and humor I think with that these small little details like if you visit a room and

422
00:33:31,786 --> 00:33:36,751
then two levels later you come back to it and something happened and you can like start reading

423
00:33:36,751 --> 00:33:41,154
these little descriptions about what stuff happened that that is something we wanted to

424
00:33:41,154 --> 00:33:47,059
go crazy with but didn't really have the time for but we'll see during early access if we

425
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:49,181
maybe can spend some more time on that.

426
00:33:50,037 --> 00:33:56,079
But I'm glad you enjoyed it the way it is, because it's something we wanted to do, but we're not particularly happy with.

427
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:59,001
Yeah, maybe Amarnath is just being fooled by the ray tracing.

428
00:33:59,001 --> 00:34:03,882
Like, I'm watching it now, I'm like, maybe it just lived in because the lighting is so good.

429
00:34:05,963 --> 00:34:07,584
Let's grab this quick.

430
00:34:07,584 --> 00:34:11,427
There's a brief discussion in chat happening about vehicles driving uphill.

431
00:34:11,427 --> 00:34:16,189
IKYY points out that in the Villa level, when you drive out of the racing garage,

432
00:34:16,189 --> 00:34:19,351
they get stopped by the angle of the road.

433
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:22,733
And other people go, oh yeah, so how do vehicles work,

434
00:34:22,733 --> 00:34:24,914
which are on wheels, which are rolling,

435
00:34:24,914 --> 00:34:26,615
how do vehicles and voxels work together?

436
00:34:26,615 --> 00:34:29,497
You said vehicle logic was the one thing people can't mod when that happens.

437
00:34:29,497 --> 00:34:32,479
So I'm curious, maybe we need to break down how vehicles work here,

438
00:34:32,479 --> 00:34:33,720
because that's so crucial to the game.

439
00:34:34,774 --> 00:34:40,297
So vehicles, the real physics are just based on spheres.

440
00:34:40,297 --> 00:34:45,980
So the wheels are actually spheres, but they do collide with each voxel.

441
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:56,626
So, and that's why this driveway to the garage is hard to get up on because you're actually driving across these bumps all the time.

442
00:34:56,626 --> 00:35:02,790
We have some ideas on how to smoothen that out a little bit in the physics, but we haven't really...

443
00:35:03,417 --> 00:35:05,158
come to that point yet.

444
00:35:05,158 --> 00:35:07,079
But it will get better.

445
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:10,661
But that's also the reason you can't really

446
00:35:10,661 --> 00:35:12,842
destroy the wheels of any vehicle.

447
00:35:12,842 --> 00:35:15,883
I don't know if you've tried, but if you try shooting the wheels,

448
00:35:15,883 --> 00:35:18,084
they're not going to fall apart,

449
00:35:18,084 --> 00:35:22,686
because we need them to be...

450
00:35:22,686 --> 00:35:23,587
to be not broken,

451
00:35:23,587 --> 00:35:25,688
because they're simulated with spheres.

452
00:35:25,688 --> 00:35:28,189
It would be fun if that actually worked,

453
00:35:28,189 --> 00:35:31,391
but I think the vehicles would be...

454
00:35:32,308 --> 00:35:38,984
massively undrivable if we try to simulate or have the wheels as boxes.

455
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:44,785
I guess, are there any other, like, the notion of shapes here is a very fun thing, like how

456
00:35:44,785 --> 00:35:46,987
to use voxels to simulate shapes.

457
00:35:46,987 --> 00:35:50,030
Are there any fun instances when making this game where you're like, okay, we need this

458
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:53,033
thing to work, but it has to be the shape, and that's kind of weird.

459
00:35:53,033 --> 00:35:56,496
Are there any other instances like that?

460
00:35:56,496 --> 00:36:00,540
Visually, there are lots of things like that.

461
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:03,222
Like, how do you make a door handle in voxels?

462
00:36:06,492 --> 00:36:12,999
Also, you see the brick wall you're standing in front of right now, you can see the individual

463
00:36:12,999 --> 00:36:17,785
bricks, so it's not just a texture, it actually has depth to it.

464
00:36:17,785 --> 00:36:23,171
Those boxes are 10 centimeters or like...

465
00:36:24,012 --> 00:36:30,015
four inches in American units, which is totally unrealistic, but it still kind of works.

466
00:36:30,015 --> 00:36:40,041
In many instances, we wanted the boxes to be half the size, but then the levels had

467
00:36:40,041 --> 00:36:48,406
to be much smaller, so we wanted to keep this voxel size for memory reasons.

468
00:36:49,127 --> 00:36:56,693
But yeah, I think the... it was mostly just visually trying to make stuff recognizable

469
00:36:56,693 --> 00:36:59,195
in this resolution has been the challenge.

470
00:36:59,195 --> 00:36:59,275
Yeah.

471
00:36:59,275 --> 00:37:06,541
Chat would like to know, we have one from Emmett's help, are you mostly CPU or GPU bound

472
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:08,863
and which part exactly takes most of the power?

473
00:37:08,863 --> 00:37:13,266
It depends entirely on the hardware, of course.

474
00:37:13,266 --> 00:37:14,407
But typically...

475
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,043
except for when you cause a lot of destruction.

476
00:37:22,043 --> 00:37:23,764
And then in all instances,

477
00:37:23,764 --> 00:37:28,288
when the frame rate drops to like five frames per second,

478
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:29,609
then it's always CPU,

479
00:37:29,609 --> 00:37:31,410
because then there's a lot of physics.

480
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:35,874
But I also would like to add that there was a lot

481
00:37:35,874 --> 00:37:39,357
of potential for optimizations that we haven't done.

482
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:41,298
So I think it's a pretty good chance

483
00:37:41,298 --> 00:37:45,762
those massive dips will actually be a lot better

484
00:37:45,762 --> 00:37:46,382
going forward.

485
00:37:47,413 --> 00:37:55,895
Yeah, I also just noticed there's like a little smoke effect that comes out of the vehicle, like that vehicle when you're, you know, like just the standard like diesel exhaust, I guess.

486
00:37:55,895 --> 00:38:04,297
Like, like, that's such like a little detail, like what's generating that? Is that that's because that can't be voxels too, right?

487
00:38:04,297 --> 00:38:09,639
No, the smoke is is also more traditionally rendered.

488
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:11,159
It's actually quite fun.

489
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:25,601
And in this game where everything is boxes, the smoke is actually polygons.

490
00:38:25,601 --> 00:38:27,323
So, oh, deception, lies.

491
00:38:27,323 --> 00:38:27,763
Yeah.

492
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:38,312
But it's rendered, the smoke is fully lit and it's using a very untraditional

493
00:38:38,312 --> 00:38:39,674
method for transparency.

494
00:38:39,674 --> 00:38:41,095
It's just stochastic transparency.

495
00:38:41,095 --> 00:38:42,917
So there's, there is actually no transparency.

496
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:45,493
It's just like either a pixel or not a pixel,

497
00:38:45,493 --> 00:38:47,995
and then dithered the whole thing

498
00:38:47,995 --> 00:38:49,437
to make it look transparent.

499
00:38:49,437 --> 00:38:51,078
Nice.

500
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,760
Yeah, so for folks in chat, we've only

501
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,981
got about 20 minutes left.

502
00:38:53,981 --> 00:38:56,524
I will desperately try to get as many questions in as I can,

503
00:38:56,524 --> 00:38:59,287
but we're also going to ask some ones from the GDC angle,

504
00:38:59,287 --> 00:39:01,929
because GDC covers a huge number of topics.

505
00:39:01,929 --> 00:39:04,152
That teardown weirdly fits into almost every single one

506
00:39:04,152 --> 00:39:05,253
of them in a different way.

507
00:39:05,313 --> 00:39:13,876
from graphics programming to narrative design to marketing, which I'm going to ask about right now before we get back to more fun voxel questions.

508
00:39:13,876 --> 00:39:24,100
This game is doing pretty well, like just glancing at the Steam reviews, seeing like I see videos for it pop up, you know you've got Chris Persons highlight reel,

509
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:32,784
which is usually my fair weather mark for like okay how much is a game getting played, like how many clips get submitted to that series.

510
00:39:33,224 --> 00:39:38,193
uh uh discloser i guess i have to disclaim that i'm a patreon i i back hit that that

511
00:39:38,193 --> 00:39:41,259
highlight reel on patreon so i guess i shouldn't just mention it without back

512
00:39:41,259 --> 00:39:44,826
disclaiming that but uh yeah um yeah so

513
00:39:45,531 --> 00:39:51,358
You said before there's already like a voxel community, you know, like there's a people who have there's a community of people around the world who want to

514
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:55,002
Play games in the space make games in the space who want to experiment with it

515
00:39:55,002 --> 00:39:58,426
Um, but but there's kind of a mainstream appeal that you're slowly getting right now

516
00:39:58,426 --> 00:40:03,552
Which you know what kind of on the chaos that this game invites like what are your kind of thought like suddenly?

517
00:40:03,552 --> 00:40:05,535
You know you're making games you're trying to sell a game

518
00:40:06,335 --> 00:40:11,077
What what has been your experience, you know trying to get people to notice and pay attention to your work

519
00:40:11,077 --> 00:40:15,818
Without fully turning your job into a game seller when you know when you're when you're yeah

520
00:40:15,818 --> 00:40:15,838
I

521
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:16,699
Think we for this game

522
00:40:16,699 --> 00:40:29,243
We actually had the luxury of not having to market it at all. We didn't really spend any

523
00:40:29,243 --> 00:40:31,443
time or money or effort marketing this game

524
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:36,281
at all, because when I started doing these experiments three years ago,

525
00:40:36,281 --> 00:40:40,282
a crowd was building up on Twitter, and I think that's

526
00:40:40,282 --> 00:40:44,483
where the whole thing started. And by the time

527
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:50,324
we came up to early access, there were multiple fan Discord servers,

528
00:40:50,324 --> 00:40:56,025
Reddit community, and there were just communities everywhere around this game,

529
00:40:56,025 --> 00:40:58,166
and we thought, like, any...

530
00:40:59,266 --> 00:41:03,065
Any marketing, traditional marketing we can do on top of this would be totally...

531
00:41:07,764 --> 00:41:10,626
So we just didn't bother at all.

532
00:41:10,626 --> 00:41:17,352
We did a couple of trailers ourselves, but that's it for marketing.

533
00:41:17,352 --> 00:41:23,177
And it's, of course, a really, really nice and good position to be in.

534
00:41:23,177 --> 00:41:32,104
And I realized that it's not something that happens to everyone, but it's...

535
00:41:32,104 --> 00:41:32,305
I think...

536
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:37,826
For this game, it stamps out a lot, just graphically.

537
00:41:37,826 --> 00:41:40,328
That's probably what appeals to some people.

538
00:41:40,328 --> 00:41:43,089
And also this enormous freedom you have.

539
00:41:43,089 --> 00:41:49,332
There's been a lot of games promising to fully

540
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:03,533
have been dreaming about for a long time, to have something that is actually fully indestructible.

541
00:42:03,533 --> 00:42:09,278
That's also been appealing to a lot of people.

542
00:42:09,278 --> 00:42:14,022
I think that fully, you know, like, fully do whatever you want logic is actually hitting

543
00:42:14,022 --> 00:42:17,284
an interesting place right now, which is, I'm trying to solve this puzzle, I'm trying

544
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:21,788
to plot out a path to, you know, grab everything and get out in 60 seconds, and right now my

545
00:42:21,788 --> 00:42:24,790
brain was going as I was up there, wait a minute, could I just cut the power to the

546
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:26,311
whole facility and turn off the alarms?

547
00:42:27,373 --> 00:42:31,057
So I came over to the power generator to try this out.

548
00:42:31,057 --> 00:42:32,759
We'll find out how it goes.

549
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:36,364
But I think this is one of the fun moments that I had recording because I was like, I

550
00:42:36,364 --> 00:42:37,526
have a brilliant idea.

551
00:42:37,526 --> 00:42:40,089
And as you're about to find out, it doesn't work.

552
00:42:40,089 --> 00:42:41,371
But I gave it a shot.

553
00:42:43,293 --> 00:42:49,236
We got folks on stream who would like to know, Merlin Maple would like to know, what are

554
00:42:49,236 --> 00:42:51,818
your thoughts about multiplayer and co-op?

555
00:42:51,818 --> 00:42:52,839
Are such things possible?

556
00:42:52,839 --> 00:42:55,180
Will that have to be left to the modders?

557
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:59,563
The discussion in chat is letting us know it might not be possible with all these voxels.

558
00:42:59,563 --> 00:43:03,525
I guess, how does multiplayer factor into your plans and what are the challenges in

559
00:43:03,525 --> 00:43:04,166
implementing it?

560
00:43:05,702 --> 00:43:11,006
It's probably the most asked question we get if this is going to go multiplayer.

561
00:43:11,006 --> 00:43:15,690
And the sad answer is that we don't have any plans for it,

562
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:21,755
because we are not convinced that it will work technically.

563
00:43:21,755 --> 00:43:24,277
It's a lot of physics to synchronize,

564
00:43:24,277 --> 00:43:29,081
and the engine is not written with networking in mind.

565
00:43:29,081 --> 00:43:34,546
So it would be a huge amount of work to even try that.

566
00:43:34,546 --> 00:43:34,966
So I...

567
00:43:38,522 --> 00:43:42,785
at least anytime soon.

568
00:43:42,785 --> 00:43:45,547
It would be very fun to experiment with.

569
00:43:45,547 --> 00:43:50,430
And I think if we did multiplayer or tried out that,

570
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:53,452
we would kind of go the same route we've done

571
00:43:53,452 --> 00:43:57,114
with the technology so far to kind of limit that

572
00:43:57,114 --> 00:44:00,916
to people with really good connections and low latency

573
00:44:00,916 --> 00:44:03,578
and not try to do something that works for everyone.

574
00:44:03,578 --> 00:44:06,280
But yeah, we'll see.

575
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:11,331
would be a lot of fun in multiplayer.

576
00:44:11,331 --> 00:44:11,891
Yeah, but...

577
00:44:11,891 --> 00:44:14,712
But I'm just not sure how to do it.

578
00:44:14,712 --> 00:44:16,093
Making games is hard.

579
00:44:16,093 --> 00:44:17,213
That's what I...

580
00:44:17,213 --> 00:44:19,254
That's what I generally...

581
00:44:19,254 --> 00:44:23,115
I come into every one of these streams going

582
00:44:23,115 --> 00:44:27,597
Making games is hard. How the hell did you make this so good?

583
00:44:27,597 --> 00:44:32,718
Yeah, let's see here.

584
00:44:32,718 --> 00:44:34,059
I...

585
00:44:34,059 --> 00:44:35,399
Man, I love this section.

586
00:44:35,399 --> 00:44:37,220
I guess we haven't talked yet about the...

587
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:44,384
Like, you briefly mentioned earlier, like, it was more fun instead of limiting players, you know, with the resources to get to the objectives.

588
00:44:44,384 --> 00:44:47,786
Like, make it easy to get to the objectives, but make the challenge in getting out.

589
00:44:47,786 --> 00:44:51,248
So we're heading to the point where I'm, like, planning a run for 60 seconds.

590
00:44:51,248 --> 00:44:53,450
And let me, let me iterate on something.

591
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:55,651
I do not believe in practicing video games.

592
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:59,633
If I need to practice something in a video game, I'm like, this has worked.

593
00:44:59,873 --> 00:45:07,820
This is a joke. I practice martial arts. I practice like, I technically practice x-wing miniatures, which is good, but I have fun doing it, you know?

594
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:12,784
Like, um, uh, but yet you, I just did, what I just did on the loop here was a run where I said,

595
00:45:12,784 --> 00:45:16,546
okay, I need to kind of know if I can do this in 60 seconds or do I need to do it.

596
00:45:16,546 --> 00:45:18,928
So congratulations, you tricked me into practicing.

597
00:45:18,928 --> 00:45:24,953
Uh, um, what, uh, what do you, what is kind of like, given your thoughts about making objectives

598
00:45:24,953 --> 00:45:27,975
like you want players to like, like experimentation.

599
00:45:28,896 --> 00:45:39,442
Yeah, I think you maybe noticed when you tried here that you cannot pick up the target without quicksaving first.

600
00:45:39,442 --> 00:45:39,642
Yeah.

601
00:45:39,642 --> 00:45:48,167
And I think that's for a long time that wasn't the case, but then we kind of forced it onto-

602
00:45:48,337 --> 00:45:50,219
to have that on this specific level,

603
00:45:50,219 --> 00:45:53,722
because we wanted to teach people

604
00:45:53,722 --> 00:45:55,784
this is how you're supposed to play the game.

605
00:45:55,784 --> 00:45:58,426
Some people consider quicksaving cheating in a game

606
00:45:58,426 --> 00:45:59,868
because they just wouldn't do it.

607
00:45:59,868 --> 00:46:01,249
They're totally wrong.

608
00:46:01,249 --> 00:46:05,653
And for this game, it's kind of crucial

609
00:46:05,653 --> 00:46:08,435
not to be overly frustrated to use quicksave.

610
00:46:08,435 --> 00:46:10,477
It's part of the gameplay to do that.

611
00:46:10,477 --> 00:46:12,999
And we actually encourage people to use that a lot.

612
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:21,942
Like if you want to try out something, quicksave, try it out, if it didn't work, you can just go back.

613
00:46:21,942 --> 00:46:26,387
And yeah, I think that is the key.

614
00:46:29,783 --> 00:46:32,445
being overly frustrated when you practice stuff,

615
00:46:32,445 --> 00:46:35,887
that you have this option of always going one step back,

616
00:46:35,887 --> 00:46:38,508
like one undue step to the whole thing.

617
00:46:38,508 --> 00:46:40,109
Yeah, Ikea, I would like to know,

618
00:46:40,109 --> 00:46:42,690
when I think of quicksaving, I think of the classic,

619
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:44,291
classic, you know, like F12, F11, or whatever,

620
00:46:44,291 --> 00:46:45,612
F11, F10, I forget what it is.

621
00:46:45,612 --> 00:46:48,474
Have you thought about adding a single button

622
00:46:48,474 --> 00:46:50,615
so that players can like do that, like classic combo?

623
00:46:51,956 --> 00:46:56,586
Yeah, we thought about it and we might add something.

624
00:46:56,586 --> 00:47:02,940
I'm not sure because we also get some comments from people who think that the quick

625
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:10,363
are too close to each other on the menu because it's very frustrating if you do something wrong

626
00:47:10,363 --> 00:47:16,426
and hit quick save instead of quick load. Oh yeah. And then having buttons for it would be

627
00:47:16,426 --> 00:47:22,730
probably a disaster for some people if they press the wrong one. But it's very intentional that you

628
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:28,593
can only go back one quick save because otherwise it would be kind of trivial if you can just rewind.

629
00:47:34,573 --> 00:47:42,579
And then we also have to be careful how we present that so people don't make the mistake

630
00:47:42,579 --> 00:47:44,480
of overwriting their own save.

631
00:47:45,109 --> 00:47:50,351
I'm caught struck right now as I'm navigating back to like execute the to execute the heist like how

632
00:47:50,351 --> 00:47:57,053
There's something very interesting about this game world that because it's so open like there's a natural human behavior like I'm like I I'm do

633
00:47:57,053 --> 00:48:00,374
We're going for things that are familiar as opposed to things that are

634
00:48:00,374 --> 00:48:05,836
Like like oh, I know this pathway. I know I can just walk up to this building and execute and begin my path

635
00:48:05,836 --> 00:48:08,117
Why am I re-stepping the entire route I took to get here?

636
00:48:08,117 --> 00:48:13,679
um, there's something very fascinating about human psychology and this kind of space that like instead of

637
00:48:14,438 --> 00:48:16,419
finding the most efficient path.

638
00:48:16,419 --> 00:48:19,940
I am just like, relying on the familiar to get through it.

639
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:22,040
And by the way, go me, I got this done in one go,

640
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,021
but I imagine it's meant to be easy,

641
00:48:24,021 --> 00:48:25,402
even though the alarms are blaring.

642
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:28,203
That's actually quite interesting,

643
00:48:28,203 --> 00:48:31,964
because this level is the first one where you do

644
00:48:31,964 --> 00:48:34,765
this time-based heist in the game.

645
00:48:34,765 --> 00:48:37,966
And I don't think I've ever seen.

646
00:48:51,668 --> 00:48:55,790
It's definitely the case for everyone who plays the game.

647
00:48:55,790 --> 00:49:00,311
Oh, I totally missed, I continue right there, I missed this when I was playing, it's reshowing

648
00:49:00,311 --> 00:49:01,832
my route there a little bit.

649
00:49:01,832 --> 00:49:03,412
Totally missed that.

650
00:49:03,412 --> 00:49:04,253
Yeah.

651
00:49:04,253 --> 00:49:05,813
When I was playing this.

652
00:49:05,813 --> 00:49:07,214
Yay, I'm an amateur!

653
00:49:10,517 --> 00:49:15,558
Okay, we've only got about 10 minutes here and sadly we won't get to simulate anything on fire.

654
00:49:15,558 --> 00:49:19,259
Um, I've got to wrap up a little bit early in a few minutes because we have a building inspector

655
00:49:19,259 --> 00:49:24,420
coming through, uh, to make sure I have not torn down the walls. Uh, fun fact! Though it did not

656
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:28,121
involve tearing down walls, we did have kind of a very teared down thing in my apartment this weekend.

657
00:49:28,121 --> 00:49:32,862
They had to tear up the floors of the living room and I had to leave my house in the middle of a

658
00:49:32,862 --> 00:49:38,243
pandemic, uh, and go hang out somewhere else, uh, while they did all that because it wasn't safe for

659
00:49:38,243 --> 00:49:40,263
us to be around. Because, uh, turns out...

660
00:49:40,684 --> 00:49:45,366
Floors shouldn't be bouncy. You know that hardwood floor should not be bouncy

661
00:49:45,366 --> 00:49:47,567
So we're gonna spend the rest of the time grabbing questions from chat

662
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:52,850
And then I'm gonna duck out so I can go meet the inspector

663
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:56,712
But merle maple I like your but merle maple would like to know

664
00:49:56,712 --> 00:50:01,634
They've quick loaded so many times when they're trying to save it's possible of their error

665
00:50:01,634 --> 00:50:04,616
Maybe it's worth adding a toggle able

666
00:50:04,616 --> 00:50:08,178
Are you sure to quick save that they can turn on and off and menus for advanced players?

667
00:50:10,028 --> 00:50:14,391
I think if there was a toggle, people would turn it off and then still get angry.

668
00:50:14,391 --> 00:50:16,132
But I'm not sure.

669
00:50:16,132 --> 00:50:17,853
It's kind of hard.

670
00:50:17,853 --> 00:50:22,575
We might experiment with separating them more on the menu so you kind of get that.

671
00:50:22,979 --> 00:50:26,621
you know, muscle memory, which like quicksave is left

672
00:50:26,621 --> 00:50:28,582
and quickload is right.

673
00:50:28,582 --> 00:50:29,022
Ooh, yeah.

674
00:50:29,022 --> 00:50:31,584
Like a menu that takes up the whole screen.

675
00:50:31,584 --> 00:50:32,604
And yeah, I like, I dig that.

676
00:50:32,604 --> 00:50:33,325
That's a UI art thing.

677
00:50:33,325 --> 00:50:38,428
Jezzy QQ would like to know about primary rates.

678
00:50:38,428 --> 00:50:40,849
How do you find the nearest intersection for each pixel?

679
00:50:40,849 --> 00:50:44,371
Do you start by rasterizing a bounding box for each object

680
00:50:44,371 --> 00:50:48,113
and march the Vixel grid of that particular object

681
00:50:48,113 --> 00:50:48,613
in the shader?

682
00:50:48,613 --> 00:50:50,875
I don't know if that was mark or marks or March.

683
00:50:50,875 --> 00:50:51,715
They spelled it March.

684
00:50:52,316 --> 00:51:00,425
March, yeah. Ray marching is a technique where you just walk along the voxel space to see when you hit something.

685
00:51:00,425 --> 00:51:04,910
And yeah, I think what he just described is pretty much how it's done.

686
00:51:14,014 --> 00:51:16,076
is one voxel volume.

687
00:51:16,076 --> 00:51:20,879
All the little debris from the wall you're hitting

688
00:51:20,879 --> 00:51:22,980
is also individual volumes.

689
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:27,723
And for each such volume, it's just rasterized a bounding box,

690
00:51:27,723 --> 00:51:30,885
and then ray-marched in a fragment shader

691
00:51:30,885 --> 00:51:34,508
to see which voxel you hit.

692
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,689
And then there is a material lookup,

693
00:51:36,689 --> 00:51:40,511
like an indexed palette for each object.

694
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:47,145
Gotcha. Josh, Duffity Wong would like to know what is the coolest clip you've seen of someone playing the game and why is it the gameplay we're watching right now?

695
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:49,467
No, that's me. What is the coolest clip you've watched?

696
00:51:49,467 --> 00:51:55,212
That must be... there are two levels in the game that we...

697
00:51:55,212 --> 00:52:06,401
It wasn't really intentional, but we added more optionals to the game, to those levels, than what we could take ourselves.

698
00:52:06,401 --> 00:52:09,643
And that's kind of evil because we didn't know if it was even possible.

699
00:52:10,536 --> 00:52:19,408
And some people hate those levels. One of them is called Fine Arts and the other one is called

700
00:52:19,408 --> 00:52:27,078
Insurance Fraud. And they are so ridiculously hard that none of the team was ever even close to.

701
00:52:28,569 --> 00:52:32,251
But it took just less than a week, I think,

702
00:52:32,251 --> 00:52:36,153
before the first one posted a movie clip

703
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:36,553
completing that.

704
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:40,995
So that was very inspiring to see

705
00:52:40,995 --> 00:52:44,497
because we didn't even know it was possible.

706
00:52:44,497 --> 00:52:46,438
And then there was one other clip

707
00:52:46,438 --> 00:52:50,400
that really caught my attention,

708
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,921
and that was a completing.

709
00:52:54,668 --> 00:52:57,231
I think was actually on the insurance fraud level,

710
00:52:57,231 --> 00:52:59,713
but not completing all the optionals,

711
00:52:59,713 --> 00:53:01,575
where he was slingshotting.

712
00:53:01,575 --> 00:53:06,039
The objective of this mission is to collect,

713
00:53:06,039 --> 00:53:07,620
put cars in a transport truck.

714
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:11,244
And there are like seven of them, I think,

715
00:53:11,244 --> 00:53:14,927
or eight, seven of them in total.

716
00:53:14,927 --> 00:53:16,829
That's why it's so hard.

717
00:53:16,829 --> 00:53:18,871
But he built a slingshot out of

718
00:53:20,352 --> 00:53:22,894
these electrical wires

719
00:53:22,894 --> 00:53:26,076
and strung them up with a huge

720
00:53:26,076 --> 00:53:28,418
excavator to build up the tension

721
00:53:28,418 --> 00:53:38,004
connected with a plank and then set fire to the plank to get like a fuse for that to burn off and when that snapped

722
00:53:38,004 --> 00:53:38,144
off

723
00:53:38,144 --> 00:53:42,027
the wires can slingshot the whole vehicle

724
00:53:42,027 --> 00:53:42,908
into the transport truck

725
00:53:43,902 --> 00:53:46,864
So that was kind of a creative way to steal a car, I think.

726
00:53:46,864 --> 00:53:49,225
That was really fun to see.

727
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:56,109
I wish we had that video to run right now.

728
00:53:56,109 --> 00:53:58,210
Trust me, I would queue it up.

729
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:01,312
Yeah, there is a YouTube video.

730
00:54:01,312 --> 00:54:06,415
I unfortunately cannot remember who posted it.

731
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:14,065
Man, okay, oh god, we gotta start wrapping things up, I apologize, although there's still

732
00:54:14,065 --> 00:54:18,989
some fun stuff happening, so enjoy my Teardown footage.

733
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:23,533
We will grab one more question before we get out of here, but before you go, folks, if

734
00:54:23,533 --> 00:54:27,696
you've enjoyed watching the stream today, thank you so much for coming, thank you for

735
00:54:27,696 --> 00:54:29,438
talking about Teardown with us.

736
00:54:29,438 --> 00:54:34,362
Dennis, thank you for making Teardown, because this game is just so neat and so cool, and

737
00:54:34,362 --> 00:54:36,043
I cannot wait to have some more fun with it.

738
00:54:36,964 --> 00:54:42,930
um uh yeah uh if you are new to GDC and what we do here at the GDC twitch channel uh we talk to

739
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:46,854
developers about the games they make if they're interesting if you click the follow button you

740
00:54:46,854 --> 00:54:51,399
can get notifications for when we go live we'd love to have you back uh i'm trying to get us

741
00:54:51,399 --> 00:54:54,041
uh some more uh at least one more cool interview for 2020

742
00:54:56,662 --> 00:55:01,563
I can't say what it is yet because we don't have a hard guess, but we want to have you all here

743
00:55:01,563 --> 00:55:07,185
talking about cool games with cool people. If you're interested in game making in general,

744
00:55:07,185 --> 00:55:13,986
you can go to the GDC YouTube channel, you can join us at GDC. If you're a game developer,

745
00:55:13,986 --> 00:55:17,687
game maker yourself, we'd love to have you. Obviously, it's a global pandemic, we're still

746
00:55:17,687 --> 00:55:22,048
trying to figure out 2021. We've got some cool stuff in the pipes right now. You have a few

747
00:55:22,048 --> 00:55:24,068
days left to sign up for our masterclass program.

748
00:55:24,969 --> 00:55:28,710
And also, if you are a game maker yourself and you ship something cool this year,

749
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:32,231
you can submit your talk to the GDC Core Concepts for 2021.

750
00:55:32,231 --> 00:55:37,772
Like, say, if someone made a game called Teardown and they should submit a talk for GDC 2021,

751
00:55:37,772 --> 00:55:42,034
I would urge you to do so.

752
00:55:42,034 --> 00:55:44,554
For my part, is there anything else we need to cover?

753
00:55:44,554 --> 00:55:46,515
Only that, yeah, thank you.

754
00:55:46,515 --> 00:55:48,195
We loved having you here and I hope...

755
00:55:49,376 --> 00:55:53,078
y'all come back and Dennis I hope we get to have this conversation after I get I

756
00:55:53,078 --> 00:55:56,880
hope we get to talk again after this exit early access cuz yeah let's do that

757
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,482
yeah thanks for having me I'm so excited for what's gonna happen for this game in

758
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:06,746
a year for our last question today um man y'all y'all are so nice in chat um

759
00:56:06,746 --> 00:56:10,728
Ken 142 would like to know how did you make the fire extinguisher smoke so

760
00:56:10,728 --> 00:56:13,570
satisfying they can't stop spraying it all over the place that's a question and

761
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:14,150
a compliment thank you

762
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:35,093
water simulation game. So it is actual fluid dynamics simulating the smoke and the extinguisher

763
00:56:35,093 --> 00:56:42,361
and I guess that's what makes it look the way it does. But it's also a lot of it comes from

764
00:56:42,361 --> 00:56:45,725
the lighting that is from the stochastic transparency.

765
00:56:46,102 --> 00:56:49,284
Right on. If folks have other questions, I urge you to check out the Teardown Discord.

766
00:56:49,284 --> 00:56:52,226
Uh, um, Dennis is also on Twitter at Tuxedo Labs.

767
00:56:52,226 --> 00:56:54,427
If we didn't get to your question today, my apologies.

768
00:56:54,427 --> 00:56:55,488
That's my fault, not Dennis's.

769
00:56:55,488 --> 00:56:57,430
Uh, blame me.

770
00:56:57,430 --> 00:56:58,630
Uh, make me the object of your hatred.

771
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:01,312
Uh, but then just go ask your question and forget that I exist.

772
00:57:01,312 --> 00:57:02,153
Um, it's fine!

773
00:57:02,153 --> 00:57:05,095
Uh, anyway, with that, that's all we've got for today.

774
00:57:05,095 --> 00:57:06,756
Uh, have a good one, everyone.

775
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,097
Stay safe, be well.

776
00:57:08,097 --> 00:57:12,500
Keep those masks on and we will get through, uh, this fucking nightmare year together.

777
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:12,560
Bye!

778
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:12,840
Alright.
