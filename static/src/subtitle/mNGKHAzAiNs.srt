Hello everybody! My name is Vera, and I'm the art director and founder of Ovil Studio.

2
00:00:06,094 --> 00:00:11,399
I'm from Moscow, Russia, and I have the honor to be invited to their own table, One Reason to Be.

3
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:17,745
In this panel, I and the other remarkable participants will share our stories about making games.

4
00:00:18,545 --> 00:00:31,961
When I was discussing a potential theme of my speech on this evening, the organizer of the panel told me that it would be interesting to hear a story about the issues that I faced making games specifically in my country, some unique experience that I had.

5
00:00:32,722 --> 00:00:37,407
And I started wondering, what part of my experience is unusual and so very special?

6
00:00:37,987 --> 00:00:39,448
Well, I actually didn't realize it.

7
00:00:39,949 --> 00:00:46,653
So, it's one more task for me and GDC to figure out the difference between making games in my country and around the world.

8
00:00:47,274 --> 00:00:50,476
Meanwhile, I will be happy to see every one of you in this panel,

9
00:00:50,876 --> 00:00:54,218
where I'm going to share my story about how we build games in Russia

10
00:00:54,599 --> 00:01:01,423
and about how I built my own successful company that already counts 30 people in just 3 years without any investments.

11
00:01:01,864 --> 00:01:03,185
Thank you and see you there!
