00:00:08,002 --> 00:00:12,725
Hello, everyone, and welcome to building cognitive accessibility into your games.

2
00:00:13,526 --> 00:00:14,887
Hi, I'm Jay Justice.

3
00:00:15,267 --> 00:00:16,508
I'm a consultant.

4
00:00:17,008 --> 00:00:20,251
I work independently, but I'm available for full time.

5
00:00:21,491 --> 00:00:27,896
So, my most recent work has been on the game Stray Gods, which just won Game of the Year at the Australian Game Developer Awards.

6
00:00:27,956 --> 00:00:29,097
So, congrats to that team.

7
00:00:31,084 --> 00:00:37,630
I've also consulted on Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realm and the upcoming Read Only Memories by MidBoss.

8
00:00:38,651 --> 00:00:43,296
And with me I have some amazing developers that I am so excited to be getting to speak alongside.

9
00:00:43,536 --> 00:00:44,417
Please introduce yourselves.

10
00:00:45,464 --> 00:00:45,945
Yeah, hi.

11
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,326
My name is Tara Velker.

12
00:00:47,426 --> 00:00:55,793
So I am the accessibility lead for studios at Xbox and I first want to say that Jay does not do themself enough justice.

13
00:00:56,434 --> 00:00:59,116
This panel would not exist without Jay.

14
00:00:59,156 --> 00:01:01,578
They literally did all of the work prepping the submission.

15
00:01:01,678 --> 00:01:06,222
I didn't even give anything to Jay on time and they still made it happen.

16
00:01:06,242 --> 00:01:07,363
So I wanted to talk Jay up.

17
00:01:08,163 --> 00:01:13,188
When I am not here at Xbox doing accessibility stuff, I'm the

18
00:01:13,628 --> 00:01:24,518
co-director of the Game Accessibility Conference, where I get to work with amazing folks, and one of the people that I love when I get an opportunity to work with is the great Morgan Baker.

19
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:27,001
Wow, that's a great transition.

20
00:01:28,862 --> 00:01:31,365
Hi everyone, I am, oh, can you hear me okay too?

21
00:01:31,385 --> 00:01:32,065
Am I close enough?

22
00:01:32,105 --> 00:01:33,687
Cool, awesome, because I can't hear myself.

23
00:01:34,107 --> 00:01:39,012
So, I'm Morgan Baker, my pronouns are she, they, and I'm the Game Accessibility Lead for

24
00:01:39,485 --> 00:01:42,146
electronic arts in my free time.

25
00:01:42,386 --> 00:01:49,489
I like to organize eSports tournaments, play tabletop RPGs, and play with my two Corgis, Midna and Zelda.

26
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,590
Can you guess my favorite game?

27
00:01:53,031 --> 00:01:57,073
But it's a pleasure to be here, and I want to reiterate, thank you, Jay, for inviting both of us today.

28
00:01:57,353 --> 00:02:01,815
Absolutely excited to talk about my favorite topic, cognitive accessibility.

29
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:09,137
and hopefully you will show on your surveys that you will definitely submit at the end of the session that it's also one of your favorite topics.

30
00:02:09,657 --> 00:02:13,481
So please do not forget to fill out your surveys because that is how we know how well we did.

31
00:02:13,581 --> 00:02:17,705
So I will only ask that twice, once at the very beginning and once at a reminder on the end.

32
00:02:17,745 --> 00:02:19,727
But please do not forget to fill out the surveys at the end.

33
00:02:20,468 --> 00:02:21,809
And Morgan, thank you for sharing your pronouns.

34
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:22,830
I forgot to share mine.

35
00:02:23,091 --> 00:02:24,332
Mine are she, her, or he, him.

36
00:02:25,614 --> 00:02:25,935
She Heart.

37
00:02:45,648 --> 00:02:57,156
Yeah, so we all have a little bit of a different background in accessibility and just game design and game development in general, but I talk a lot about gaming being a three-step process.

38
00:02:57,236 --> 00:03:01,199
That the first thing we do is we get information from the game.

39
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:01,980
What do we see?

40
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:02,900
What do we hear?

41
00:03:03,021 --> 00:03:04,602
If it has haptics, what do we feel?

42
00:03:05,262 --> 00:03:07,884
and we take in that information and then we process it.

43
00:03:08,444 --> 00:03:14,328
And then as we process it, we determine our course of action and then output back to the game.

44
00:03:14,448 --> 00:03:16,009
We tell the game what we want to do.

45
00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:19,131
And it's this three-step process that is blank a game.

46
00:03:19,472 --> 00:03:20,833
Doesn't matter how complex it is.

47
00:03:21,313 --> 00:03:28,958
But cognitive accessibility specifically is something has interrupted the processing part of that three-step process.

48
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:32,021
process for playing games.

49
00:03:32,101 --> 00:03:44,592
And so when we're talking about cognitive accessibility, we're talking about making sure that people can process the information correctly so that they can provide the right output to the game based on the information that they have received.

50
00:03:45,072 --> 00:03:45,893
Yeah, absolutely.

51
00:03:45,973 --> 00:03:57,701
And adding on to that too, it really ties into the idea of like perceptions, so making sure that you can process this information comfortably, you're able to comprehend it, and you're able to use the product with ease.

52
00:03:57,861 --> 00:04:03,705
Of course, when we talk about cognitive accessibility, it's universal and everyone wins when we're constantly thinking about it.

53
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:09,889
And so it's really important for us to consider these barriers that occur in the nature of processing information.

54
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,558
Okay, so we've defined it very clearly.

55
00:04:12,738 --> 00:04:15,539
The next step, who is cognitive accessibility for?

56
00:04:16,179 --> 00:04:18,040
Everybody, everybody, but really though.

57
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:28,685
Players with conditions related to processing information, including but not limited to ADHD, TBIs, PTSD, and many other neurological and mental conditions.

58
00:04:28,965 --> 00:04:31,567
And literally anyone who needs it can be both situational and temporary.

59
00:04:31,767 --> 00:04:32,487
You guys want to expand?

60
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:41,461
Yeah, I think what a lot of people don't realize is, you know, yes, having ADHD is going to impact how you interact with a game.

61
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:50,330
Having a traumatic brain injury, like having a number of, even one good severe concussion can interact how you play with games.

62
00:04:51,351 --> 00:04:55,995
And even things like PTSD, again, about how do you process information.

63
00:04:56,515 --> 00:04:58,937
can all be part of it.

64
00:04:59,037 --> 00:05:04,520
And sometimes it is neurological, sometimes it is going to be more specifically related to mental health.

65
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:10,945
One of the things that you're gonna see up here is like, we all have cognitive disabilities.

66
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:13,046
So like, you'll notice we're all up here with our notes and everything.

67
00:05:13,066 --> 00:05:16,548
They're like, oh yeah, like we wrote stuff down to make sure that we can hit it.

68
00:05:16,768 --> 00:05:22,312
So for us, you know, it is a wide range of things that all have a very,

69
00:05:24,433 --> 00:05:27,596
that all have a very similar set of needs.

70
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:39,965
I cannot talk about the irony about putting a talk about cognitive accessibility by a bunch of people with cognitive disabilities at 5 p.m.

71
00:05:40,085 --> 00:05:41,045
on a con day.

72
00:05:41,065 --> 00:05:44,208
We are struggling hard up here.

73
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:47,770
So, you know, who is cognitive accessibility for?

74
00:05:49,231 --> 00:05:50,152
It is for us.

75
00:05:51,673 --> 00:05:52,153
Exactly.

76
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:55,236
And also, too, I like that I wrote down my... It's so suiting.

77
00:05:55,336 --> 00:05:59,899
At a cognitive accessibility, I, like, wrote down notes for myself, and I'm like, come on, Morgan, you got this.

78
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,563
But I haven't narrowed down to thinking about cognitive accessibility for myself.

79
00:06:04,643 --> 00:06:16,772
I often think about conditions as we've talked about, like processing, but we also have, like, processing speed, learning, memory, attention, focus, mental endurance, and all these things overlap, and it's holistic.

80
00:06:17,392 --> 00:06:23,117
every disability, every condition, whether it's permanent, temporary, or situational, it is holistic in this nature.

81
00:06:23,197 --> 00:06:29,182
And so, again, it's for everyone, but especially we want to think about those who really, really need it.

82
00:06:29,743 --> 00:06:36,208
And if you want to think about hard numbers, remember that a lot of people who have processing disorders may not even consider themselves to be disabled.

83
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:42,634
So there's millions of people who would benefit from getting more accessibility

84
00:06:43,268 --> 00:06:46,390
that would actually address some of the issues that they're having with processing information.

85
00:06:46,811 --> 00:06:55,637
Well, and I think something that's really common is there are a lot of people who, first off, never receive a formal diagnosis or are diagnosed super late in life.

86
00:06:56,137 --> 00:07:11,288
So not only do we have people who do have these diagnoses who don't identify as disabled, there are people with these conditions who have no idea that they have these conditions and that they've basically been playing their life on hard mode the entire time and no one told them.

87
00:07:11,628 --> 00:07:27,582
Yeah, that's totally true, and especially we have to really recognize that there is a stigma sometimes too around it, and we want to have that contextually when we're thinking about our games and designing our games, knowing that, you know, people will have different worldviews with cognitive accessibility.

88
00:07:28,022 --> 00:07:34,168
Of course, there's nothing wrong with ADHD, OCD, I'm like a hot mess express over here, choo-choo all aboard.

89
00:07:34,768 --> 00:07:48,273
But, you know, I think, though, it's important for us to think about that stigma constantly to make sure that we are approaching our cognitive accessibility with the utmost sensitivity for our players.

90
00:07:49,313 --> 00:07:49,894
Very well said.

91
00:07:51,234 --> 00:07:51,634
All right.

92
00:07:52,374 --> 00:07:57,176
What challenges do people who would benefit from cognitive accessibility face when playing games?

93
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:02,238
Some challenges or barriers include cognitive overload, sensory overload,

94
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:02,810
on

95
00:08:17,954 --> 00:08:18,815
you know these challenges.

96
00:08:18,895 --> 00:08:27,121
One of the things that I tend to think about is basically for some reason the amount of info coming in short circuits the processing part.

97
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:28,441
Like it's overcharged.

98
00:08:28,482 --> 00:08:30,203
It's a transformer exploding.

99
00:08:30,663 --> 00:08:34,266
You know you want to continue but the input is way way too much.

100
00:08:35,106 --> 00:08:39,049
And, you know, that just means when that happens for a lot of people, you shut down.

101
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,271
But that's only for certain people.

102
00:08:41,752 --> 00:08:45,555
There are going to be other people where the reverse happens.

103
00:08:45,695 --> 00:08:51,339
There's not enough information coming into the machine for you to justify continuing running it right now.

104
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:53,541
So that's when you get distracted.

105
00:08:53,581 --> 00:08:54,522
You do something else.

106
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:55,162
on

107
00:09:14,065 --> 00:09:14,586
talk talk

108
00:09:29,282 --> 00:09:37,749
Yeah, especially when we talk about overstimulation and endurance, we have to think about the short-term versus that long-term as well, right?

109
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:44,134
So the idea of the short-term of so much information being thrown at you at once that your brain, I say, it works.

110
00:09:44,935 --> 00:09:46,076
Let's be honest.

111
00:09:46,136 --> 00:09:58,326
Where we have the long-term of the constant pressure of trying to process information, and every single person has different thresholds, and so we need to design accordingly, thinking about these different thresholds.

112
00:09:58,746 --> 00:10:09,535
So, like, for example, we have different thresholds that relate to someone who may have, like, a visual processing disorder versus an auditory processing disorder versus anything else.

113
00:10:09,595 --> 00:10:10,816
Maybe it's sensory.

114
00:10:10,936 --> 00:10:12,977
Maybe it's sensation.

115
00:10:13,057 --> 00:10:19,683
And all these things kind of combine together to create, well, what we need to address, cognitive accessibility, right?

116
00:10:20,563 --> 00:10:41,322
And so that's something we constantly need to think about and actually for myself sometimes I describe it This might not be helpful But I say I have a basket and I can only put so many beans in the basket before they all just start spilling out and everyone has like Different types of basket sizes for like yeah my so I have bad auditory processing so my basket for auditory is very small and

117
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:55,706
but have good visual processing, so that basket's much bigger, and so we need to think about constantly how we can accommodate and think about our designs and our games in a way that is accessible and approachable to everyone with different sized baskets.

118
00:10:56,286 --> 00:10:58,827
I told you it's not a perfect thing, just roll with me here, okay?

119
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:08,916
But I think you can roll with the basket analogy, because what's really nice is like, you know, I have a basket, but I'm just really particular about how full my basket is.

120
00:11:09,476 --> 00:11:12,619
Like, I just want it to always be the same level.

121
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:15,742
There was actually a really great talk at the Game Accessibility Conference

122
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:31,305
by an accessibility consultant named Shell Little, and they talked about the sweet spot between being overwhelmed and boredom, and how so many things can add beans to that basket.

123
00:11:31,785 --> 00:11:40,067
And so for Shell, they have talked about having ADHD, and for them, even just having, like,

124
00:11:40,427 --> 00:11:55,255
you know something that's like an animated like circle that shows your amount of mana but if it's constantly moving every time that's moving that's adding a bean into the basket like none of us are saying you know what the cool core loop of my game is watching that animation

125
00:11:55,635 --> 00:11:55,795
Right?

126
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:56,936
Like that's not what we're saying.

127
00:11:56,976 --> 00:11:58,516
Like that was not the core loop for fun.

128
00:11:58,937 --> 00:12:08,041
And if someone came up and told you, like, hey, all I can do is watch that animation of that little potion bottle in the corner, you'd be like, oh, crap, there's a whole bunch of game they're not getting to.

129
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:15,404
But that's because that animation put too many beans in the basket before they actually got to go and play and enjoy your game.

130
00:12:15,664 --> 00:12:18,966
And as Morgan said, there's a lot of things that add beans to that basket.

131
00:12:19,366 --> 00:12:20,227
It can be the sound.

132
00:12:20,347 --> 00:12:21,327
It can be animations.

133
00:12:21,487 --> 00:12:22,548
It can be haptics.

134
00:12:23,188 --> 00:12:24,449
there is a lot.

135
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:26,150
It could be your inventory management.

136
00:12:27,071 --> 00:12:30,333
But again, as Morgan highlighted, it could be different for everyone.

137
00:12:30,453 --> 00:12:32,394
And I'm sure that it's different for Jay.

138
00:12:32,474 --> 00:12:34,896
I don't know what beans add to your basket.

139
00:12:34,936 --> 00:12:37,218
We're just running with the beans in the basket panel.

140
00:12:42,521 --> 00:12:57,371
Yeah, the big barrier, it's like all of these things are different bricks in a wall and the big wall, the thing that makes people stop playing games that they were otherwise really enjoying is the fact that they're unable to process the information because there's too much of something or there's not enough of something.

141
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:05,516
And the big issue that we have is that a lot of games don't really take into account that you don't need to be throwing so much information at the player.

142
00:13:05,596 --> 00:13:07,157
You can figure out a way to make something

143
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:13,321
maybe more modular, maybe more customizable so that you can pick and choose the things that are going to be getting an input.

144
00:13:13,861 --> 00:13:16,563
And we're going to talk more about that on the next slide.

145
00:13:18,028 --> 00:13:18,248
Okay.

146
00:13:18,428 --> 00:13:20,950
So this is how we do it.

147
00:13:21,531 --> 00:13:23,852
What are some of the best practices for cognitive accessibility?

148
00:13:24,713 --> 00:13:26,294
You guys had some great suggestions earlier.

149
00:13:26,975 --> 00:13:28,696
Allowing manual saves any time.

150
00:13:28,756 --> 00:13:29,476
We all need this.

151
00:13:29,957 --> 00:13:30,937
Offering trigger warnings.

152
00:13:31,358 --> 00:13:32,979
Offer easy to understand subtitles.

153
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,661
Sharing accessibility info ahead of launch.

154
00:13:36,521 --> 00:13:39,524
Regular testing for light and motion sensitivities throughout production.

155
00:13:40,124 --> 00:13:46,128
And evaluating menu animations or UI to determine if they're truly necessary or off the ability to turn the little mono thingy off.

156
00:13:47,803 --> 00:13:58,004
Alright, please tell us more about some of these because I think these are really great suggestions that can help people who are currently developing games get the idea for making it more accessible in the pipeline before they finish.

157
00:13:59,535 --> 00:14:11,739
Yeah, so one of the first things I want to call out about this list is some of them you may not realize unless you live in the cognitive accessibility space like we do, is it's not immediately clear, wait, why does that help?

158
00:14:11,939 --> 00:14:18,161
Like having easy-to-understand subtitles, like why does having easy-to-understand subtitles work?

159
00:14:18,282 --> 00:14:24,504
I mean, obviously, more again, different, deaf, like clearly, like that's a required feature, but like I don't have

160
00:14:25,424 --> 00:14:29,985
you know, any sort of issues with being hard of hearing, but I always play my games with subtitles.

161
00:14:30,385 --> 00:14:31,085
And why is that?

162
00:14:31,445 --> 00:14:39,207
Well, if I'm taking in enough information, like if there's a bunch of sounds, like at some point, my brain will still not really understand what's being said.

163
00:14:39,287 --> 00:14:46,388
And so I still need that secondary channel of information to reinforce what I'm hearing to kind of lock it into place.

164
00:14:47,348 --> 00:14:54,550
And, you know, there, I mean, there's, I don't want to, like, I could personally talk about this slide for the next,

165
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:55,870
45 minutes.

166
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:04,473
But I think what I just kind of hit on that one, maybe I'll let Morgan and Jay talk about more, and then I'll just give a 20-minute lecture on trigger warnings.

167
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:05,193
That sounds good.

168
00:15:05,213 --> 00:15:05,733
OK, all right.

169
00:15:05,793 --> 00:15:06,133
Morgan.

170
00:15:08,734 --> 00:15:11,114
Yeah, no, but I think you're bringing up a good point.

171
00:15:11,334 --> 00:15:16,076
And it kind of goes back to the universality of when we're thinking about cognitive accessibility, right?

172
00:15:16,556 --> 00:15:18,076
Designed, for one, extends to many.

173
00:15:18,556 --> 00:15:23,698
It's beneficial for someone who is deaf or hard of hearing, but also beneficial for someone who has auditory processing,

174
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:25,919
or the intersectionality of it all.

175
00:15:41,866 --> 00:15:46,092
And actually, the intersection of that and deafness, as a fun fact, is extremely high.

176
00:15:47,373 --> 00:15:55,925
So, as a little tidbit for today, just keep in mind that these features are beneficial for someone who has, say, deaf or hard of hearing.

177
00:15:55,945 --> 00:15:56,887
They have a hearing condition.

178
00:15:57,647 --> 00:16:12,252
or it can be beneficial to someone who has visual processing, auditory processing, or like, honestly, subtitles are just really nice because maybe your kid is in the room and they're being really freaking loud and you're like, you know, I don't know what's happening in this game anymore.

179
00:16:12,432 --> 00:16:13,773
Amp it up the subtitle size.

180
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:30,198
Well, I think even like the example of like, you know, having kids in the room or other people in the room, like as someone with ADHD, one of the reasons like having manual saves is really, really important to me is because I will lose track of when the game last saved and I will get distracted.

181
00:16:30,418 --> 00:16:40,862
Even if it's my favorite game in the entire world, Alan Wake 2, I will get distracted and I will need to be able to make sure that it has saved because I know I'm going to

182
00:16:41,682 --> 00:16:43,962
end up getting so distracted I won't come back.

183
00:16:44,023 --> 00:16:45,763
So being able to be like, hey, I need to save right now.

184
00:16:47,283 --> 00:17:03,687
It's also really important because there are times I know I'm getting ready to go into something that is going to be cognitively challenging, and there is nothing worse than starting a really cognitive challenging task, but the save being like 10 minutes before that cognitively challenging task starts.

185
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:10,428
So all of a sudden, like, not only did I just die, but now I have to redo whatever I did, which I don't remember for sure.

186
00:17:10,788 --> 00:17:13,149
like, oh, it's a puzzle that I should already know the solution to?

187
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:13,670
Nope.

188
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:14,530
It's gone.

189
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:17,792
Like, as soon as that was completed, my brain has dumped that information.

190
00:17:17,812 --> 00:17:18,693
We're not coming back to that.

191
00:17:19,093 --> 00:17:24,336
So if I have to redo that now to get to my new cognitively challenged thing, I'm going to have a lot of issues.

192
00:17:24,696 --> 00:17:37,784
So being able to, you know, make sure I've saved so that I always know, hey, I get to have a point where I can start fresh or I don't have to remember that thing that I did 20 minutes ago because I got to save after it was done is really, really important to me.

193
00:17:38,284 --> 00:17:38,624
Same.

194
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:42,827
I can't tell you how many games I've just never gone back to because I was like, I'm not doing this again, I swear.

195
00:17:45,249 --> 00:17:45,649
New.

196
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:54,075
So sharing accessibility info ahead of launch is extremely impactful, and I'm so happy to be seeing so many more companies do this because it tells

197
00:17:54,535 --> 00:18:00,400
your extremely large disabled audience that there is going to be a way for them to experience this game.

198
00:18:00,961 --> 00:18:10,769
It gives people an idea of what to expect and it gives really helpful information about how your game is going to be able to be experienced by others.

199
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:27,115
It's fantastic and I really appreciate getting to see that a lot more and I hope that it's something that gets done more as well because it shows that the company and the developers had taken the time to do research and to really implement these practices into their game because they're ready to go.

200
00:18:27,555 --> 00:18:28,215
with this whole list.

201
00:18:28,555 --> 00:18:30,256
There's been a bunch of titles lately that I've had.

202
00:18:30,296 --> 00:18:33,077
Have you noticed the Ubisoft ones that came out?

203
00:18:33,217 --> 00:18:35,138
Oh, no, the Ubisoft ones are great.

204
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:38,519
And Jessica, is it Roche?

205
00:18:38,899 --> 00:18:39,199
Roche?

206
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:41,860
I love how I gestured towards Morgan, like she would...

207
00:18:43,101 --> 00:19:00,762
She works at Ubisoft in their marketing division and she did a great talk about their accessibility marketing plan and how Ubisoft specifically built a framework to get that accessibility out.

208
00:19:01,282 --> 00:19:04,485
ahead of the game's launch so that players can make informed decisions.

209
00:19:04,765 --> 00:19:12,152
Because especially in the cognitive accessibility space, being able to make an informed decision as a player is absolutely key.

210
00:19:12,532 --> 00:19:15,455
And we'll get a little bit more into that.

211
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:20,099
I actually submitted a bunch of slides for Dead Space, which isn't even the title I worked on.

212
00:19:20,139 --> 00:19:21,060
That was Morgan's title.

213
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:27,545
Because they did some great stuff around informed decisions, which is why trigger warnings are so important.

214
00:19:27,585 --> 00:19:27,786
Yes.

215
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,601
brought it all the way back around.

216
00:19:30,781 --> 00:19:32,023
I talk a lot about trigger warnings.

217
00:19:32,103 --> 00:19:34,045
And you're going to when we get to that slide.

218
00:19:34,085 --> 00:19:34,365
I know.

219
00:19:36,307 --> 00:19:36,647
All right.

220
00:19:36,707 --> 00:19:40,752
First up, what are some examples of cognitive accessibility in games that you've worked on or played?

221
00:19:40,832 --> 00:19:41,572
How are they beneficial?

222
00:19:41,652 --> 00:19:43,675
Can I please do this one because I love this one so much?

223
00:19:43,775 --> 00:19:44,015
Okay.

224
00:19:44,335 --> 00:19:49,821
So this is an example of an always available training area from Jedi Survivor, which was a fantastic game.

225
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:50,822
I absolutely loved it.

226
00:19:51,602 --> 00:19:56,964
This really helped the player experience getting to Train as a Jedi.

227
00:19:57,064 --> 00:20:01,486
And if you forgot how to do a move, it didn't take you out of the gameplay at all.

228
00:20:01,586 --> 00:20:03,187
You were meditating as Cal.

229
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:04,548
It was something that was always present.

230
00:20:04,568 --> 00:20:06,768
You could just get to a save point and you could just do this.

231
00:20:06,868 --> 00:20:15,952
And it really helped keep the flow of the game going without making it feel like they were... No one's going to ever say that this is like, oh, it's easy mode or whatever.

232
00:20:15,972 --> 00:20:20,254
You're not going to be able to make a player feel bad for needing more training because it's something that

233
00:20:20,714 --> 00:20:25,655
is just part of the gameplay experience and it was just so well done.

234
00:20:26,536 --> 00:20:36,298
I've had other games that were similar, like Monster Hunter has a very easy access training area as well, but this one just felt so rooted to the core of the game itself that it was just perfect.

235
00:20:37,018 --> 00:20:47,061
It made it easier to beat bosses that I don't think I would have been able to beat otherwise because I was able to practice so often and not feel like it was taking me out of the game because it was just part of

236
00:20:47,522 --> 00:20:47,642
what

237
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:16,921
isn't something that's only locked to a specific difficulty or whatever, they're going to be less likely to use it because it's othering.

238
00:21:17,261 --> 00:21:21,204
And players with cognitive disabilities, we don't want to be othered.

239
00:21:21,244 --> 00:21:22,565
We are regular players.

240
00:21:23,466 --> 00:21:26,568
And so taking that time as a developer to make these instances

241
00:21:27,028 --> 00:21:35,290
core to the experience, and as weird as it sounds, give the player permission and know that it's okay to do this, is actually really important.

242
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:47,453
And your language and how you access these things really can help inform how comfortable the player feels in engaging stuff like your tutorials, your trials, or even going back and looking up information that they already had available.

243
00:21:48,126 --> 00:21:48,386
at all.

244
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,373
And so this is a perfect thing, right?

245
00:22:06,673 --> 00:22:10,875
Because it's helpful for, let's say, you pick up an item and you're like, I just literally don't get how to do this.

246
00:22:10,915 --> 00:22:11,815
I want to practice it.

247
00:22:11,855 --> 00:22:20,877
I want to understand it more, really comprehend the mechanics around it, and really have that information processing in that kind of space with no sort of penalty to practice.

248
00:22:21,357 --> 00:22:25,138
But it's also helpful, too, if you're just like, I literally just don't remember what's happening anymore.

249
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:27,819
That happens to me all the time, and I can see many of you as well.

250
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:29,839
All right.

251
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:31,680
Next up, Dead Space.

252
00:22:32,848 --> 00:22:42,938
I mean, technically this is your game, I just put the slides in, so I'm not sure who's supposed to... I mean, maybe we could do a little twofer here.

253
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:52,228
So, in addition to ADHD, I do have PTSD, and for me, being able to make an informed decision is really important.

254
00:22:53,368 --> 00:23:00,851
I'm really lucky that I have most of my PTSD under control, but I need to be able to make informed decisions.

255
00:23:01,551 --> 00:23:06,132
Like many disabilities, how impactful it is varies day to day.

256
00:23:06,613 --> 00:23:12,755
There will be days that, like, I am unstoppable and I can see things related to my trauma absolutely no problem.

257
00:23:13,215 --> 00:23:19,957
There are other days, if I'm not in a good spot, that seeing that content can actually trigger a physical flashback.

258
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:31,520
I hope that you never have to experience one, but if you do have one, your body literally feels like it did at the time that you experienced the trauma.

259
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,900
And it is weird.

260
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,381
You're both in your body and not at the same time.

261
00:23:37,221 --> 00:23:38,321
It's not great.

262
00:23:39,121 --> 00:23:39,802
Zero out of ten.

263
00:23:39,862 --> 00:23:40,682
Do not recommend.

264
00:23:41,342 --> 00:23:46,183
And there are some games that have some, like, pretty shitty content warnings.

265
00:23:46,823 --> 00:23:48,724
Like, I won't name the game.

266
00:23:50,264 --> 00:23:57,529
but there was one that I played that the content warning was basically like, hey, this game talks about serious topics.

267
00:24:00,151 --> 00:24:01,032
Cool.

268
00:24:01,872 --> 00:24:12,340
The topics in the game were actually, these are graphic, it was rape, the Holocaust, and child sexual abuse.

269
00:24:14,175 --> 00:24:22,440
and how are you supposed to make an informed decision around those things if you're only told, hey,

270
00:24:23,637 --> 00:24:24,978
there's serious topics in here.

271
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:31,143
Like, maybe one day, I don't want to play a game about the Holocaust.

272
00:24:31,964 --> 00:24:38,149
Like, it's okay for me to make that decision, and it's about empowering me to make those kinds of decisions.

273
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:51,601
And as a person who loves horror games, who very frequently have these very serious or traumatic topics, I really, really want to have that, which is why I was so obsessed with the Dead Space remake.

274
00:24:53,705 --> 00:25:08,380
And also to reiterate some things, so we actually did a talk at GA Conf, which you're the co-director of, I did a talk with Christian and myself talking about this, where specifically for Dead Space there is kind of two features happening.

275
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:12,162
One is that you can hide the scenes, visually hide them.

276
00:25:12,682 --> 00:25:28,089
And the second one is that we have a content warning that comes up before the scene happens, and we try to time it so that players, if they read the content warning, they can make that informed decision to say, not today, maybe I'll pause and, you know, come back later.

277
00:25:28,749 --> 00:25:43,961
And actually this goes back to like informed purchasing decision conversation where actually the Motive website has an entire section dedicated to these content warnings that show how they work but also to details each content warning so you can just read them before you even jump into the game.

278
00:25:44,181 --> 00:25:51,447
So we try to do that for folks so they can make that decision before they ever even purchase the game if that this is something that they want to experience.

279
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:54,652
Yeah, and it connects back to what we were saying earlier.

280
00:25:54,712 --> 00:25:59,255
Like for me, as someone with PTSD, my processing sometimes just breaks.

281
00:25:59,495 --> 00:26:04,218
And so it's me looking at my machine and being like, do I think it can handle the stress?

282
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:08,181
Or do I think that my processing will shut down if I look at that topic?

283
00:26:08,681 --> 00:26:26,609
which is why having these are so great and why, again, like, I cannot, like, stress how great of an example Dead Space is in both being very transparent about the topic matter that is covered and when it is covered and also telling you in the game, so, which is double great.

284
00:26:26,709 --> 00:26:32,571
As someone with PTSD and ADHD, oh, sure, I could read, oh, Chapter 5 is about this.

285
00:26:33,031 --> 00:26:35,332
Do you think I remember that when I get to Chapter 5?

286
00:26:35,372 --> 00:26:35,432
No.

287
00:26:37,193 --> 00:26:39,915
talk, because your question will probably be answered for that.

288
00:26:54,630 --> 00:27:00,752
Okay, and then this was the one that you sent me for Grounded, which has an arachnophobia mode, which I have arachnophobia, so thank God.

289
00:27:01,812 --> 00:27:03,492
I mean, well, we can do the same thing.

290
00:27:03,572 --> 00:27:07,674
You can talk about what it meant to you as a player, and then I can talk about it from the developer's side.

291
00:27:08,114 --> 00:27:23,338
Okay, so unfortunately, this is a phobia that makes a lot of games just unplayable for me, but luckily, this one turned something that I physically cannot look at without feeling ill and I'm going to panic and not be able to function to something that's honestly kind of cute.

292
00:27:23,718 --> 00:27:23,978
like this.

293
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,652
Would you like to access those options now?

294
00:27:43,373 --> 00:27:44,614
It's yes, so fast.

295
00:27:44,855 --> 00:27:47,017
It doesn't make the player feel shame.

296
00:27:47,077 --> 00:27:49,580
It doesn't actually have any kind of negative connotation whatsoever.

297
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,721
It's just an option.

298
00:27:50,821 --> 00:27:54,725
It's completely a neutral choice and it just makes the game playable.

299
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:58,069
It's just accessibility in a nutshell.

300
00:27:58,629 --> 00:28:00,531
We're not trying to tell you what's good or what's bad.

301
00:28:00,591 --> 00:28:01,753
We're just making it playable for you.

302
00:28:03,103 --> 00:28:07,428
And this was actually something that originated from out of the dead team itself.

303
00:28:07,488 --> 00:28:08,709
So I do want to be transparent.

304
00:28:09,049 --> 00:28:10,991
This feature shift before I was in my role.

305
00:28:11,111 --> 00:28:13,774
So I am telling the story of I have heard from the devs.

306
00:28:13,814 --> 00:28:15,015
I was not personally on the feature.

307
00:28:15,315 --> 00:28:17,337
I don't want to steal credit because they're amazing.

308
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,823
But basically there were some folks internally who were like, I am not into spiders.

309
00:28:24,104 --> 00:28:25,806
And so this is making it stressful.

310
00:28:25,846 --> 00:28:36,216
So there was actually user research done internally within Xbox where we ended up taking people from across Xbox, not just on this particular dev team, and talking to them

311
00:28:36,676 --> 00:28:41,760
about their experiences and how their arachnophobia manifests.

312
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,522
So it's not called the spider slider, but I like to call it the spider slider.

313
00:28:46,563 --> 00:28:47,404
How that manifests.

314
00:28:47,444 --> 00:28:50,506
So what you see here is the danger dumpling.

315
00:28:50,566 --> 00:28:53,468
So this is the least spidery spider you can get.

316
00:28:53,888 --> 00:29:03,813
But for some people, there was kind of a middle ground of like, oh, when it is full spider, that is when I can't handle it.

317
00:29:03,913 --> 00:29:07,794
But when it was halfway through the spider slider, they were absolutely fine.

318
00:29:08,135 --> 00:29:14,117
So that kind of shows that how spidery it had to be to trip the phobia was unique for everyone.

319
00:29:14,297 --> 00:29:18,719
So being able to customize it unblocked people with that phobia.

320
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,361
But again, it comes down to, you kind of hit on it earlier,

321
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:26,985
You know, being able to stand up to a spider isn't the key part of Grounded.

322
00:29:27,145 --> 00:29:28,926
It could be any creature.

323
00:29:29,087 --> 00:29:32,850
Like, it didn't actually matter what creature it was as long as it fit in the Grounded universe.

324
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:41,437
So if we could unlock the ability for more people to play by just making it a danger dumpling instead of a spider, like, that's pretty straightforward.

325
00:29:41,457 --> 00:29:42,177
Because again, like,

326
00:29:42,938 --> 00:29:46,460
that it wasn't explicit in the game score loop that it had to be a spider.

327
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,921
A spider makes sense for grounded contextually.

328
00:29:49,081 --> 00:29:51,783
I mean, you're little people and you're fighting bugs and all that stuff.

329
00:29:52,443 --> 00:29:55,265
But like, why did it have to be a spider?

330
00:29:55,585 --> 00:30:04,750
No, it was really about this kind of combat moment and this having something bigger than you that you needed to be able to make decisions around, you know, didn't actually have to be a spider.

331
00:30:06,647 --> 00:30:10,871
Do we include the example of the lasophobia to the setting that they added?

332
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:21,280
was

333
00:30:45,268 --> 00:30:45,348
of

334
00:31:05,034 --> 00:31:20,922
the actual encapsulated fear around the actual fear of Sorry, I should have said it's the fear of giant open water So the idea of like no way like if you put me in a cruise ship, I will probably cry Although I really want to go on the Disney cruise so bad.

335
00:31:20,982 --> 00:31:21,022
Oh

336
00:31:22,905 --> 00:31:28,267
Maybe one day, if you blindfold me, I may be able to... Maybe you just always have an interior cabin, I don't know.

337
00:31:28,867 --> 00:31:32,908
But then again, I like horror games, so maybe it'll just be like a horror experience the entire time for me.

338
00:31:32,948 --> 00:31:36,049
Y'all are having fun, you know, having your mixed drinks, and I'm crying, you know?

339
00:31:37,169 --> 00:31:45,692
I'm just, I know this isn't the topic of this panel, but I'm picturing you and being scared, but like, and having like a kind of like Five Nights at Freddy's vibe, because it's a Disney cruise.

340
00:31:47,543 --> 00:31:48,564
Y'all are hilarious.

341
00:31:48,764 --> 00:31:49,244
Oh my god.

342
00:31:50,084 --> 00:32:11,715
It's funny you mentioned Horizon Zero Dawn because the slide I forgot to put in for myself was Horizon Forbidden West because they added a feature that allows you to change your concentration time and to have Aloy do an auto heal and also basically remove some of the load of trying to remember all the things you have to do at once to loot the robots as you're killing them, to remember how to aim, to do everything.

343
00:32:12,215 --> 00:32:15,697
And it still works in a way to make it feel like you're still playing as Aloy.

344
00:32:15,717 --> 00:32:17,138
It doesn't make the game any more, like,

345
00:32:17,898 --> 00:32:24,961
It's still extremely challenging, but it removes a bit of the mental load of having to remember to do so many things to avoid dying.

346
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:34,024
And it's just a fantastically accessible game overall, but I really appreciated the cognitive features that they added to make hunting not quite as arduous.

347
00:32:35,185 --> 00:32:40,247
I died so many times, and I was like, let me just turn these features on, and it just made the game even more fun for me.

348
00:32:41,328 --> 00:32:42,909
All right, so next.

349
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:49,833
What cognitive accessibility features or design choices would you like to see become standard in the future?

350
00:32:51,448 --> 00:32:59,595
So navigation assistance is one I added because I really appreciate games that don't just throw you out like naked and afraid, you're just in the woods, you're just out here trying to find your way.

351
00:33:00,576 --> 00:33:06,000
I want every game in the future to have just press L3, tell me where I'm going, give me a ping, give me a direction, something.

352
00:33:06,881 --> 00:33:10,864
An easy to access controls guide, just knowing what controls do what.

353
00:33:11,645 --> 00:33:13,847
And I'll let you go on about your favorite thing.

354
00:33:15,087 --> 00:33:16,869
I mean, yeah, useful trigger warnings.

355
00:33:16,989 --> 00:33:20,873
If you have a trigger warning that's not useful, like, thanks for wasting both of our time.

356
00:33:21,033 --> 00:33:22,815
Like, just please, just make it useful.

357
00:33:25,097 --> 00:33:29,322
And Morgan, I know you suggested the tutorials, especially that was your thing.

358
00:33:29,552 --> 00:33:29,632
of

359
00:33:47,923 --> 00:33:48,003
team.

360
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:06,098
talk.

361
00:34:22,155 --> 00:34:39,539
I hear some folks will talk about this, like, tutorialization, and I've seen folks even play around with the idea of, like, learnability, the idea of, like, being able to solidify that in the memory and then also being able to revisit it whenever you want to, once again, reinforce your understanding and reinforce your comprehension.

362
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:42,280
And also, too, if you just literally don't remember.

363
00:34:43,657 --> 00:34:52,687
Speaking of don't remember, persistent on-screen prompts that you can toggle on and off as an option, but I really appreciate how in Monster Hunter, I don't remember how to attack.

364
00:34:52,727 --> 00:34:53,348
It's been three months.

365
00:34:53,448 --> 00:34:54,209
Oh, it's right there.

366
00:34:54,269 --> 00:34:55,510
Literally, it is always right there.

367
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:57,252
I don't remember how to swing from tree to tree.

368
00:34:57,352 --> 00:34:58,173
Wait, there it is.

369
00:34:58,413 --> 00:35:03,519
It's just part of the heads-up display, and it just makes it so much easier, and I would love if more games did this.

370
00:35:03,939 --> 00:35:10,524
So I know that there's a big move to make games more cinematic, like you're watching a movie, but I want something to remind me that it's a game.

371
00:35:10,564 --> 00:35:12,325
It's okay for the game to know it's a game.

372
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:16,488
I'm good with it being a press A to attack in the corner like an arcade.

373
00:35:17,509 --> 00:35:20,511
So I know it's aesthetic for a lot of games, but I think it can still be accessible.

374
00:35:21,292 --> 00:35:32,880
Yeah, and I'm one of the people who also forget controls all the time, especially if there's a game where there's something like a stealth element where you're supposed to come behind someone and then do something very specifically.

375
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,722
to stealth kill them versus like loudly throw an axe or something.

376
00:35:37,442 --> 00:35:45,346
I will accidentally loudly throw an axe unless that like, hey, don't forget, just just press L1 and you'll stab them silently.

377
00:35:45,666 --> 00:35:47,247
Like I need to have that reminder.

378
00:35:47,267 --> 00:35:55,912
I'll just be like, oh, and no, and then everyone will be alerted and I'll die because I could not in the heat of the moment remember what button is the do it silently.

379
00:35:56,012 --> 00:35:58,333
This is the stealth part of the game, you idiot button.

380
00:35:59,669 --> 00:36:00,470
I'm always the meme.

381
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,252
I tried to kill a guy and gave him my rations.

382
00:36:02,313 --> 00:36:04,455
That's me every time.

383
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:08,340
There's too many controls.

384
00:36:09,262 --> 00:36:09,662
Oh, man.

385
00:36:09,722 --> 00:36:09,943
Okay.

386
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:15,370
And I remember, Morgan, you wanted to expand a little bit more on better motion and licensitivity considerations.

387
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,991
Yeah, absolutely, especially for this one.

388
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:25,436
Remember we were talking about earlier, like the overload and stuff like that, because it's not just the information you're presenting, but the extreme of that information, right?

389
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:36,082
So for example, if I have like, yeah, this one thing to have a prompt that says like, press A, but if you have a flashing in someone's face and there's all these visual effects around, that's changing the way that someone can process the information.

390
00:36:36,502 --> 00:36:42,125
And so we want to make sure, or if it's moving around too, which then we can talk about motion sickness too, all of this is connected.

391
00:36:42,185 --> 00:36:43,566
It's the brain, welcome to the brain.

392
00:36:44,046 --> 00:36:45,127
Yeah, I know, right?

393
00:36:45,587 --> 00:36:47,148
All three of us also get motion sick.

394
00:36:47,628 --> 00:36:48,288
Thank you for asking.

395
00:36:49,069 --> 00:36:51,130
So we're just a combo, the three of us.

396
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,691
But that's something we need to consider.

397
00:36:53,711 --> 00:37:03,616
And actually, I will give a shout out to Electronic Arts, actually, which released Iris last year, which is a free photosensitivity testing tool designed for games.

398
00:37:04,356 --> 00:37:05,117
Anyone can use it.

399
00:37:05,157 --> 00:37:07,398
You can go to our website and you can download the code.

400
00:37:07,418 --> 00:37:08,639
You have to build a front end for it.

401
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,760
But yeah, that's a tool that's available to everyone in this room right now.

402
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,061
So definitely check it out.

403
00:37:14,175 --> 00:37:23,618
And I definitely, the cost is $3.99, again, versus the other ones out there, which cost significantly more money.

404
00:37:24,658 --> 00:37:30,560
I just want to reiterate, if you're looking to do it, that one is very cost effective in that you don't have to pay for it.

405
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:38,582
And this last one I added based on my experience in game development class with other indie devs who are just starting out and learning how to make games.

406
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:55,970
Teaching everyone who is learning how to make games right now that it's a good choice to just at least attempt to present information in as many ways as possible when developing a game can actually help you figure out ways to make your game more accessible early in the process as opposed to trying to finish the game and then do it later.

407
00:37:56,390 --> 00:38:07,777
Because if you're thinking about how your player is getting information from you, it will give you an idea of where the gaps are in what you're making so that you can actually help them get over that barrier before you've even made it.

408
00:38:08,517 --> 00:38:14,778
And a lot of my classmates were asking me, because they know that I do accessibility consulting, but I also, like, I'm working in Unreal and I'm learning how to make games on my own.

409
00:38:15,518 --> 00:38:18,539
But, like, I can't make a game accessible by myself.

410
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:19,199
I'm just one person.

411
00:38:19,219 --> 00:38:27,361
I'm like, you do not have to single-handedly hit this checklist that we all, like, have in our imaginations of every single possible access need.

412
00:38:27,521 --> 00:38:28,721
Like, that's not what we're saying.

413
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:34,342
We're saying, based on what your game is, what information is important for you to give the player

414
00:38:34,855 --> 00:38:38,398
and how else can you do that using the blueprints that you've learned in class?

415
00:38:38,438 --> 00:38:42,861
I'm not trying to tell you learn everything right now, but knowing what you know, how else can you do this?

416
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:50,527
Just starting with that small thought can really empower a developer to reach a goal they didn't know they could reach because they didn't know it was possible.

417
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:55,251
The gist of it is that I preach this everywhere, even in the drive-thru at McDonald's.

418
00:38:55,411 --> 00:38:57,073
We're going to make things more accessible.

419
00:38:58,507 --> 00:38:59,488
Ma'am, this is a Wendy's.

420
00:38:59,548 --> 00:39:02,930
Exactly.

421
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:10,554
You know, I absolutely love that Jay added and brought this up because it again gives me a chance to talk about Alan Wake 2.

422
00:39:12,455 --> 00:39:22,941
So, one of the really key things is like you can do this like re-giving information to people in cool and creative ways that can be enjoyed by everyone.

423
00:39:23,501 --> 00:39:23,581
I'm

424
00:39:41,598 --> 00:39:44,999
playing, she's an FBI detective, trying to solve this case.

425
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:53,362
As you go through, there is literally a board where as you learn new things, you pin it to the board and you get to connect pieces of information.

426
00:39:54,062 --> 00:39:58,043
And when Saga learns something important, it gets put on the board.

427
00:39:58,164 --> 00:40:08,467
And if she is able to draw conclusions from learning multiple things, she's like, oh, case closed, puts a note on it about what she learned from all of the information that she was able to collect.

428
00:40:08,987 --> 00:40:23,474
and this exists that the player is always able to go and look at it, and you can always go back through any of the key pieces of information that you have, and you can even go reopen closed case files so that you can learn more information.

429
00:40:23,894 --> 00:40:37,601
So for me, that's a really, really cool way of providing this information I received primarily via audio, via in-game conversations in another way, but also going a step further and contextualizing it

430
00:40:37,881 --> 00:40:45,682
with other key pieces of story information that I have learned in the game, and that also helps inform what your next objective is going to be.

431
00:40:45,882 --> 00:40:51,363
You can also view your current game story objective at any given time on the same thing.

432
00:40:51,904 --> 00:41:03,266
For me, I view that entire mind board as a great accessibility tool, because it gives me that information, it gives me that recap, but other people love it as well.

433
00:41:03,746 --> 00:41:05,446
You don't have to be prescriptive.

434
00:41:05,826 --> 00:41:16,313
like Jay was saying, you can come up with cool ways to integrate this level in accessibility that is new and radical and engages all of your player base.

435
00:41:17,294 --> 00:41:29,362
And actually, this, I know we kind of are touching and getting into this where, so oftentimes when I'm working with different studios and dev teams, when we talk about accessibility, you typically can bucket into

436
00:41:30,342 --> 00:41:30,462
of

437
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:52,052
accessible to people who have temporary, permanent, or situational cognitive conditions, just by design, exactly as you're describing.

438
00:41:52,452 --> 00:42:03,756
You don't need, this is like the story of all of our lives, is oftentimes when people say, accessibility, I have an accessibility menu, and it's like, that's great, but like also too, what are we doing in the actual fundamental design itself?

439
00:42:03,856 --> 00:42:10,678
We can elevate our games when we're thinking about accessibility early and often fundamentally through the actual design itself.

440
00:42:11,078 --> 00:42:13,160
And this is an excellent example that you brought up for this.

441
00:42:13,501 --> 00:42:15,743
Oh yeah, you can see I'm getting a live pedestal right now.

442
00:42:15,803 --> 00:42:17,245
Like, ah, accessibility matters!

443
00:42:18,626 --> 00:42:19,787
But of course, it's a balance.

444
00:42:19,928 --> 00:42:21,409
Both will always be necessary.

445
00:42:21,509 --> 00:42:27,756
But this is an excellent example in the context of cognitive accessibility, where you can have it baked in.

446
00:42:28,076 --> 00:42:31,039
That's right, I'm making a baker reference, because my last name is Baker.

447
00:42:36,447 --> 00:42:37,127
And that's it.

448
00:42:37,227 --> 00:42:38,488
Thanks for coming to our talk.

449
00:42:38,608 --> 00:42:40,869
If you have any questions, we have a microphone set up.

450
00:42:41,629 --> 00:42:43,050
Oh, the polite applause is so sweet.

451
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:43,650
Thank you.

452
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:50,493
And again, please don't forget to fill out your survey.

453
00:42:51,753 --> 00:42:52,314
If you liked us.

454
00:42:52,354 --> 00:42:53,774
If you didn't like us, please don't fill it out.

455
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:14,103
I just want to add something that I experienced from working with people with intellectual disability in the last few years.

456
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:18,924
That's a group that is highly dependent on personalization or individual settings.

457
00:43:19,826 --> 00:43:22,607
At the same time, they can't often do those settings themselves.

458
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:24,127
They are relying on other people to do it.

459
00:43:25,027 --> 00:43:30,609
Like, for instance, a day activity center has staff that needs to help them to set things up.

460
00:43:31,389 --> 00:43:34,550
And I've worked also with games in these settings.

461
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:39,771
And one of the issues is that the staff is not tech savvy.

462
00:43:39,791 --> 00:43:40,552
They're not gamers.

463
00:43:40,592 --> 00:43:42,232
They like to help to work with people.

464
00:43:42,969 --> 00:43:55,494
So it's a hard time to get them to actually learn how to make the settings understand what the game settings are and what it means for the person and so on.

465
00:43:56,674 --> 00:44:04,957
So it has to be made super simple so that the staff can actually understand how to adapt it for the individual person.

466
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:12,883
One way of doing it could be to have, like, instead of having a menu with settings, you could have like a wizard style.

467
00:44:13,143 --> 00:44:21,307
You get one question at a time, step by step, and then you could more easily, at least, make correct settings.

468
00:44:22,328 --> 00:44:23,528
But there's another way.

469
00:44:24,249 --> 00:44:30,172
It is proposed by a professor here in the US called Greg Vanderheiden, who is kind of a

470
00:44:31,086 --> 00:44:37,432
superstar in accessibility is behind the W3C WCAG guidelines and many other things.

471
00:44:38,393 --> 00:44:44,338
And he has come up with this concept called the Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure, GPII.net.

472
00:44:45,419 --> 00:44:50,384
And one of the ideas there is that you can have some universally

473
00:44:51,717 --> 00:44:58,558
available preferences that is individualized and easily available.

474
00:45:00,059 --> 00:45:04,940
So you could adapt any type of application.

475
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,881
It's not all about games, but I think it can be also applied for that.

476
00:45:10,981 --> 00:45:19,363
We require, of course, that the game industry joins forces and come up with this kind of a universal format that all game companies could

477
00:45:20,659 --> 00:45:23,901
I'm so sorry, you didn't have a question?

478
00:45:43,257 --> 00:45:46,560
Now it's just a comment and an addition to what you said.

479
00:45:46,620 --> 00:46:03,092
You're focusing a lot on the game itself, that's great, but also think about how to make the settings, because otherwise all the features of accessibility can be in vain, because they will not be able to play the game anyway, because the settings cannot be

480
00:46:03,673 --> 00:46:14,109
Yeah, we have limited time for questions, but this will be a great topic to cover at the roundtable, the IGDA Game Accessibility SIG roundtable, where we can have a proper discussion.

481
00:46:15,431 --> 00:46:16,012
Great point, thank you.

482
00:46:19,768 --> 00:46:20,929
Hey there, I'm Lindsay.

483
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:23,551
First of all, great talk.

484
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:30,157
As someone with ADHD, I resonated with so many things and it was just awesome.

485
00:46:30,217 --> 00:46:33,800
My question relates to my role, actually.

486
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,862
I'm a narrative designer at Hasbro, so I work on tabletop.

487
00:46:41,212 --> 00:46:52,840
Working in narrative on tabletop means that you're responsible for a lot of the onboarding and making rules clear and accessible for everyone.

488
00:46:53,240 --> 00:47:03,707
So I was just wondering, in your experience with playing tabletop games, is there anything that sticks out to you specifically that you think could improve the onboarding experience?

489
00:47:05,007 --> 00:47:05,788
Ooh, good question.

490
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:11,640
Well, so for me, handing me a rule book is like a no-go.

491
00:47:12,801 --> 00:47:13,401
It's not going to work.

492
00:47:14,702 --> 00:47:26,469
So for me, it's always, like, I am more like, well, the number one way that I will learn a game is if someone is there to teach me, which I get.

493
00:47:26,529 --> 00:47:30,472
You cannot ship yourself with every game, as much as I'm sure you would love to.

494
00:47:31,252 --> 00:47:34,114
So for me, I do a lot better with, like,

495
00:47:37,452 --> 00:48:05,502
so normally I do not do well with verbal instructions so I acknowledge that what I'm getting ready to say also doesn't sound like it would make a lot of sense so a lot of times it's visually being able to see what is happening like the cause and effect so for me it's not as much like verbally hearing instructions like that's not going to work either because I will stop paying attention but having even if it's just like gifs in the middle of written instructions like hey like you're watching a board game or here's your paper

496
00:48:06,322 --> 00:48:07,342
Do you want to see this instead?

497
00:48:07,382 --> 00:48:10,963
Like, go visit this website where we've inserted GIFs in in the instructions.

498
00:48:11,483 --> 00:48:19,086
That is way more likely to sink in because I will see, like, the connection of what I just read and what it translates to in the game itself.

499
00:48:19,586 --> 00:48:20,506
So that's something I need.

500
00:48:20,566 --> 00:48:27,608
But I know, Morgan, you've got a lot more, like, actual... Morgan's got actual accessibility work in board games, so...

501
00:48:28,608 --> 00:48:30,130
Yeah, no, but it's absolutely true.

502
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:33,694
When you're thinking about this, you want to connect the dots, right?

503
00:48:34,135 --> 00:48:43,206
And so actually, well, speaking of board games specifically, one thing that I like is, so I used to do consultancy work over at Exploding Kittens, which is a lot of fun helping with accessibility there.

504
00:48:43,466 --> 00:48:43,827
Super cool.

505
00:48:44,417 --> 00:48:44,497
I'm

506
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:08,165
And so this is something that's really helpful because it reinforces, hi, I have ADHD, so when I love board games, I will drool.

507
00:49:08,746 --> 00:49:11,949
If you sit me down, I will just not understand what's happening.

508
00:49:11,989 --> 00:49:13,710
I see all the colors and the pieces.

509
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:15,933
And I'm just like, my brain goes this way.

510
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:16,974
And then people are like, hey, Morgan.

511
00:49:16,994 --> 00:49:17,554
I'm like, yes.

512
00:49:17,814 --> 00:49:20,917
Oh, sorry, you were talking and compounded with the deaf thing.

513
00:49:21,598 --> 00:49:25,642
And so you want to make sure that you have things that can create

514
00:49:25,982 --> 00:49:26,282
team.

515
00:49:46,092 --> 00:49:46,252
you can

516
00:50:04,587 --> 00:50:05,147
side effects.

517
00:50:26,553 --> 00:50:29,355
I saw a lot of myself and I was like, wow, this makes a lot of sense.

518
00:50:29,455 --> 00:50:30,535
And I'm struggling.

519
00:50:31,116 --> 00:50:32,256
Wow, this makes a lot of sense.

520
00:50:32,317 --> 00:50:32,817
Oh my God.

521
00:50:32,877 --> 00:50:33,557
Okay.

522
00:50:33,597 --> 00:50:37,159
I'm seeing, you know, a lot of them ended up, you know, really relating to me.

523
00:50:37,219 --> 00:50:38,740
And I was like, yeah, that was me.

524
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:39,541
You are me.

525
00:50:39,561 --> 00:50:40,581
And we, I get you.

526
00:50:41,602 --> 00:50:48,926
So for my question is, for someone like me, I'm kind of trying to transition out of the clinical field.

527
00:50:49,467 --> 00:50:51,388
And I've always been a gamer, always been

528
00:50:51,828 --> 00:50:53,569
I love ADHD and D&D.

529
00:50:53,649 --> 00:50:56,730
Those things go really well together for a lot of beautiful reasons.

530
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:01,971
But I'm trying to get into more of the accessibility and video gaming world.

531
00:51:02,331 --> 00:51:11,454
And I love the fact that you guys touched upon executive functioning, basically, and all the way you break down stuff and making cognitive accessibility in games.

532
00:51:12,115 --> 00:51:18,797
What would you give as an advice for someone who's looking to get into and kind of doing what you guys do?

533
00:51:22,945 --> 00:51:23,766
Great question.

534
00:51:25,368 --> 00:51:26,810
We all have such different paths.

535
00:51:27,271 --> 00:51:39,327
So if you ask anyone who works in game accessibility, how did you get into game accessibility, we all came from radically different backgrounds because it's such a new field overall.

536
00:51:42,409 --> 00:51:53,557
I guess the good news is there's not a clear cut path forward and you can use your previous experiences and forge your own way.

537
00:51:54,918 --> 00:51:59,960
And the bad news is, is there's not anywhere clear-cut, so I can't give you a guidebook, and you're going to have to forge your own way.

538
00:52:00,981 --> 00:52:10,305
But honestly, I think a lot of good accessibility work comes from connections and being able to learn from a wide breadth of people.

539
00:52:10,666 --> 00:52:16,769
Because everyone in accessibility comes from different backgrounds, you are constantly learning from everyone else in accessibility.

540
00:52:16,849 --> 00:52:19,290
Like, I learn shit from these two constantly.

541
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:23,052
So... For me, I came from education, and I work in games now.

542
00:52:23,092 --> 00:52:23,712
How did that happen?

543
00:52:24,452 --> 00:52:45,162
So, yeah So like honestly, I I would start with finding a game accessibility community that it's easy for you to connect with whether it's finding people who are doing groups Meetups locally or whether it's joining something online like the game accessibility conference has an online discord I've been discord.

544
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:49,204
Yeah, it's just finding those things and then making the

545
00:52:50,164 --> 00:52:59,569
the connections and you'll like again like there isn't a guide but like you'll start to see your path forward as you get more information so that's not very helpful but it's honest.

546
00:52:59,869 --> 00:53:16,839
No but it's true too just to add sorry is that there's like also things like accessibility game jams are happening and stuff like that and so that's a fantastic way to start and I will always say this it's good to focus on accessibility but accessibility touches everything in games right that's what we've been talking about there's probably people here from every single

547
00:53:17,299 --> 00:53:19,941
background, you know, doing different things in games.

548
00:53:20,461 --> 00:53:24,104
And so the nice thing is to get into accessibility, no one's stopping you, right?

549
00:53:24,184 --> 00:53:26,866
If you work in games, you can just do accessibility.

550
00:53:26,906 --> 00:53:28,247
And I think that's the beauty of it, right?

551
00:53:28,767 --> 00:53:35,472
And then as you fall in love with it, if you find that this is something I want to focus more and more on, then you can kind of start exploring the career paths for that.

552
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:37,573
I mean, that's basically, I was a game designer.

553
00:53:37,994 --> 00:53:43,418
I mean, like, we just kind of all kind of fell more and more into this field in that way, so.

554
00:53:44,358 --> 00:53:45,459
I wish there was like a manual.

555
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,481
I don't think any job has a manual in this industry.

556
00:53:48,262 --> 00:53:49,443
But this one definitely doesn't.

557
00:53:50,364 --> 00:53:58,071
Hi, I'm Frederic and I have a question for Morgane about the

558
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:10,710
Oops, sorry.

559
00:54:11,571 --> 00:54:14,113
How about the trigger warning in this place?

560
00:54:14,213 --> 00:54:17,256
How can you avoid spoilers with this?

561
00:54:20,594 --> 00:54:23,636
Do you avoid spoilers in the trigger warnings in Dead Space?

562
00:54:24,057 --> 00:54:25,938
Oh, that's a great question.

563
00:54:26,258 --> 00:54:29,040
And I have to give the full-blown credit.

564
00:54:29,521 --> 00:54:32,843
So for the trigger warnings in Dead Space, we call them content warnings.

565
00:54:33,143 --> 00:54:34,564
Pick your tomato, tomato, right?

566
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:40,729
But the way we avoided that was we went through the entire script and the narrative team

567
00:54:41,229 --> 00:54:45,811
went above and beyond to make sure that they wrote language that wouldn't necessarily spoil things.

568
00:54:46,191 --> 00:54:52,033
If you've played Dead Space, you can imagine that there might be spoilers as you're saying certain things.

569
00:54:52,513 --> 00:54:55,334
If you know the game, it kind of involves mental health at the end of the day.

570
00:54:55,974 --> 00:55:04,497
And so it was completely on the narrative team, and they went through and did mitigation and went through different risks, looked through the actual language itself,

571
00:55:04,857 --> 00:55:09,759
to make sure, is it telling the players what type of content?

572
00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:17,782
And I talk about this in the GA conference, where a lot of the content warnings are grounded specifically in violence towards humans.

573
00:55:18,542 --> 00:55:29,826
And so we made sure to write the warnings in a way that can convey that information quickly, one, but also make sure that it doesn't spoil anything else or kind of pull someone out of that immersion.

574
00:55:29,906 --> 00:55:33,007
I give the full-blown credit to the narrative team for achieving that.

575
00:55:34,186 --> 00:55:34,927
Okay, thank you.

576
00:55:36,508 --> 00:55:37,068
Great question.

577
00:55:38,129 --> 00:55:40,051
That was a hard one too, if you know the game.

578
00:55:52,101 --> 00:55:57,165
Hi, I work for a platform which is mostly centered around user-created content.

579
00:55:58,086 --> 00:56:03,030
Do you have any suggestions for how we can add accessibility but for

580
00:56:04,082 --> 00:56:07,003
you know, UGC for things that are end user created.

581
00:56:08,284 --> 00:56:09,185
Is it like mods?

582
00:56:09,245 --> 00:56:09,685
Is it art?

583
00:56:09,725 --> 00:56:10,545
Like, what's the content?

584
00:56:11,906 --> 00:56:12,486
Sort of everything.

585
00:56:12,566 --> 00:56:13,507
It's VR chat.

586
00:56:14,367 --> 00:56:14,968
Oh, okay.

587
00:56:17,329 --> 00:56:29,435
Well, I think the first thing is, so accessibility in any space is as much about culture change as it is about the actual technical or design implementations.

588
00:56:30,335 --> 00:56:42,903
So, honestly, like, one of the first things that I would do is, because it's reliant on UGC, like, you cannot personally go in and verify every single piece of content to ever to be accessible.

589
00:56:43,704 --> 00:56:45,745
That's just not feasible realistically.

590
00:56:45,805 --> 00:56:46,766
Like, that does not scale.

591
00:56:47,406 --> 00:56:52,810
And so, honestly, what I would start with would be having an educational moment or push for your platform

592
00:56:53,390 --> 00:57:00,196
to do the education and training to give to your content creators so that they understand what it is and what it's important.

593
00:57:00,616 --> 00:57:06,602
So the first step would be kind of creating that educational moment, but the second thing is you'll need to figure out some sort of rewards.

594
00:57:06,722 --> 00:57:09,284
Like, if they have done it, how can you reward them?

595
00:57:09,724 --> 00:57:16,190
So, like, one of the things that exists on not just Xbox but also PlayStation is our accessibility tags in the storefront.

596
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:24,800
So if you meet certain criteria, like your subtitles are the right size, the right contrast, etc, etc, you can get the subtitle tag in the storefront.

597
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:30,066
Having subtitles does not guarantee you the subtitle tag, because they have to be good subtitles to get the tag, right?

598
00:57:30,567 --> 00:57:34,211
So, like, is there a way where you could kind of have some process that

599
00:57:34,511 --> 00:57:41,655
Hey, if a developer has said, like, hey, we have done accessibility, is there a way that you can make their UGC more prominent?

600
00:57:42,035 --> 00:57:43,816
Can you give it a higher rating?

601
00:57:44,177 --> 00:57:48,899
I don't know enough about I get VR sick, so I don't really go into VR chat and that kind of thing.

602
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:53,062
That's kind of how SEO works for accessibility outside of games, right?

603
00:57:53,122 --> 00:57:56,805
If you're adding all text, the SEO actually improves for it.

604
00:57:57,145 --> 00:57:59,106
So you can think about it through that lens of rewarding.

605
00:57:59,146 --> 00:57:59,766
I love that.

606
00:58:00,167 --> 00:58:04,970
Rewarding the players for thinking about accessible design and those who are creating the content itself.

607
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:10,434
I don't want to spread misinformation, but I think Roblox might have a very similar system to this.

608
00:58:11,174 --> 00:58:11,894
Oh, I think that's right.

609
00:58:11,934 --> 00:58:16,757
I think they even had like, they put out guidelines too.

610
00:58:16,857 --> 00:58:17,537
They actually know.

611
00:58:18,017 --> 00:58:22,059
All I'm doing is subconsciously copying what Roblox did a couple of years ago.

612
00:58:25,921 --> 00:58:26,221
Thank you.

613
00:58:26,841 --> 00:58:28,042
We have time for one more question.

614
00:58:29,988 --> 00:58:32,249
Hi, my name is Monica, and I will stab my eye.

615
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:41,775
I recently started a UI UX tech club, and I really want to include accessibility in the planning phase as opposed to the end.

616
00:58:42,475 --> 00:58:50,380
But I have no idea at all about accessibility besides the link for the URL and adding ALT.

617
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:54,463
So I'm learning a lot, and I'm part of the video game development club at my school.

618
00:58:54,963 --> 00:58:58,405
And I'm usually in some kind of leadership or game manager position.

619
00:58:59,105 --> 00:59:02,566
And honestly, we're all learning, and there's not much time.

620
00:59:02,666 --> 00:59:08,167
So I've experienced, at least in the game area, where accessibility's kind of just chopped off.

621
00:59:08,607 --> 00:59:18,549
So I was thinking, and I heard that there's not really a manual, but I was thinking, are there some resources out there that are super bite-sized so we can focus on one aspect of accessibility?

622
00:59:18,589 --> 00:59:21,369
Because we also kind of, not argue, but we're like, what about subtitles?

623
00:59:21,389 --> 00:59:22,709
What about something else?

624
00:59:22,729 --> 00:59:24,170
And I'm like, I don't know which one to pick.

625
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:25,390
So it's kind of hard.

626
00:59:26,825 --> 00:59:29,809
Yeah, so there is a lot.

627
00:59:29,849 --> 00:59:33,753
We've all been in accessibility for years, so what we would do would be different.

628
00:59:33,833 --> 00:59:35,135
So I guess there's two things.

629
00:59:35,215 --> 00:59:43,885
For each individual title, what you go to tackle will not be the same, because it is going to be dependent on your team size, your tech, what you've already done.

630
00:59:44,885 --> 00:59:48,827
and what is the fastest, easiest, most bang for your buck is going to vary.

631
00:59:49,747 --> 00:59:57,210
That being said, there are a bunch of guidelines that are publicly available, including the Xbox accessibility guidelines, but they are very, very dense.

632
00:59:58,191 --> 01:00:02,693
So for me, an accessibility expert, those are really easy to work with, because I already have that background.

633
01:00:03,213 --> 01:00:13,437
Something that may be more easy for you to consume is gameaccessibilityguidelines.com, and one of the things with that website is it's broken down into basic, intermediate, and advanced.

634
01:00:13,877 --> 01:00:20,284
so that if you are brand new, you know kind of like, hey, these are some of the most important ones that you can start with and tackle those.

635
01:00:21,025 --> 01:00:25,770
There is also some really great other things that Xbox has put out.

636
01:00:26,491 --> 01:00:33,098
Transparency, I did not work on them, but the team of folks who did are fantastic, such as there's the...

637
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:41,924
Microsoft Gaming Accessibility Fundamentals training course, which is a learning course that you can take that will give you a lot of really great information.

638
01:00:42,724 --> 01:00:51,450
There is also, everything has acronyms and I never remember any of them, and I feel really bad because Brandon's right back there and he would like actually know the names of these things.

639
01:00:52,591 --> 01:00:59,475
But one is the person, there's one that has personas that like break down some common cons.

640
01:01:06,125 --> 01:01:10,128
Oh, I'm off the hook!

641
01:01:12,911 --> 01:01:15,052
Gaming Experience Disability Guide.

642
01:01:16,593 --> 01:01:23,138
And there's also a great one on in-person events that Brandon actually wrote, but I would recommend all of those resources.

643
01:01:24,039 --> 01:01:24,559
Thank you so much.

644
01:01:24,959 --> 01:01:25,500
Yeah, thank you.

645
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:27,561
And I think with that, we're out of time.

646
01:01:27,882 --> 01:01:28,502
They've opened the doors.

647
01:01:28,542 --> 01:01:28,922
Thank you.
