1
00:00:12,104 --> 00:00:16,149
Hey, everyone, welcome to our panel about making commercial indie games as a professor.

2
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:21,636
In this session, we're going to hear the stories of four professors slash game designers.

3
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:25,055
Four brave souls who decided it's in fact possible

4
00:00:25,215 --> 00:00:29,979
and maybe even a good idea to mix this volatile combination

5
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,201
of demanding professional roles.

6
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:36,484
Four daring adventurers who looked academic tenure criteria

7
00:00:36,524 --> 00:00:37,986
dead in the eye and asked themselves,

8
00:00:38,366 --> 00:00:41,028
can I please have some game industry-style crunch with that?

9
00:00:41,668 --> 00:00:44,070
So it's a bold proposition if there ever was one,

10
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,193
but clearly it's also a meaningful one.

11
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:49,495
After all, as game designers,

12
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:51,697
aren't we all a little bit of mad scientists?

13
00:00:52,202 --> 00:00:54,624
eager to throw away the shackles of commercial demands

14
00:00:55,004 --> 00:00:57,607
in exchange for unbridled academic freedom,

15
00:00:58,087 --> 00:01:00,990
which brings us to the big dramatic question

16
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,332
that we are going to address today.

17
00:01:03,872 --> 00:01:06,435
Game design academia, is it living the dream

18
00:01:06,935 --> 00:01:08,637
or is it surviving a nightmare?

19
00:01:08,917 --> 00:01:10,578
Well, let's find out about that.

20
00:01:10,999 --> 00:01:12,260
Now, before we go there though,

21
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,741
it's time for introductions.

22
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:16,123
Now, Michael, I'm about to start a new position

23
00:01:16,184 --> 00:01:17,244
at Northeastern University.

24
00:01:17,646 --> 00:01:20,988
But for the past eight years, I have held a joint position

25
00:01:21,028 --> 00:01:23,450
between the College of Education and the Department

26
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,072
of Emerging Technology and Design and Business

27
00:01:26,412 --> 00:01:29,854
at Miami University of Ohio, where a few years ago,

28
00:01:30,034 --> 00:01:33,717
I got my tenure, which is a key element of Miami

29
00:01:33,757 --> 00:01:37,179
being that it's an R2, which means that they have

30
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:40,482
high research activity and tenure criteria are substantial,

31
00:01:40,982 --> 00:01:43,143
but they also have a significant teaching load.

32
00:01:43,163 --> 00:01:45,825
So my scholarship is about games and aging.

33
00:01:46,531 --> 00:01:49,133
And my latest project is called Brukel.

34
00:01:49,253 --> 00:01:51,995
It's a horror game based on the authentic memories

35
00:01:52,476 --> 00:01:54,438
of my at the time 92 year old grandmother

36
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:57,020
that has stole two players in her own voice.

37
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,321
So that's me.

38
00:01:58,962 --> 00:02:00,283
Our next panelist is Chris.

39
00:02:01,304 --> 00:02:03,426
Hi, my name is Chris Totten.

40
00:02:03,946 --> 00:02:06,088
I'm an assistant professor of game design

41
00:02:06,128 --> 00:02:07,509
at Kent State University.

42
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:09,791
I'm also the program coordinator

43
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:12,794
of our animation game design or AGD program.

44
00:02:14,005 --> 00:02:16,509
So I have my own indie game studio pie for breakfast.

45
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:30,447
My tenure home is on Kent State's Tuscarawas campus in our College of Applied and Technical Studies, and I teach classes in our program at three of the campuses within the Kent State system.

46
00:02:31,915 --> 00:02:37,542
You know, I've done my academic stuff includes, you know, writing books about game design and level design.

47
00:02:37,562 --> 00:02:41,166
I co-founded the Smithsonian American Art Museum Arcade.

48
00:02:41,846 --> 00:02:46,992
But I'm here to talk about my games through Pie for Breakfast, the first of which is...

49
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:56,164
La Mancha, which is a tabletop storytelling game based on Miguel de Cervantes' Dom Quixote.

50
00:02:57,044 --> 00:03:01,466
The game was successfully funded on Kickstarter in November of 2018 and released commercially

51
00:03:01,767 --> 00:03:04,528
in the fall of 2019.

52
00:03:05,609 --> 00:03:10,551
And my studio's current project is a game called Little Nemo and the Nightmare Fiends,

53
00:03:11,532 --> 00:03:15,654
which is done in collaboration with another indie studio, Pixel Please.

54
00:03:16,495 --> 00:03:22,982
and based on the work of animation pioneer Windsor McKay. It was just funded successfully

55
00:03:23,022 --> 00:03:28,707
on Kickstarter back in March of this year and is currently in development for PC and Switch.

56
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:35,228
I think I'll just jump in there.

57
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:35,748
Go ahead.

58
00:03:36,028 --> 00:03:36,748
All right.

59
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:38,769
Hi, everyone.

60
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:39,970
I'm Tracy Fullerton.

61
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,892
I am a professor and also director emeritus

62
00:03:44,152 --> 00:03:47,353
of the USC Games Program at the University of Southern

63
00:03:47,373 --> 00:03:47,893
California.

64
00:03:48,634 --> 00:03:51,455
Also, I hold the Electronic Arts Endowed Chair

65
00:03:51,595 --> 00:03:52,615
in Interactive Media.

66
00:03:53,536 --> 00:03:56,177
And I am the director of the Game Innovation Lab, which

67
00:03:56,257 --> 00:03:57,958
is my research group at USC.

68
00:03:58,898 --> 00:04:07,503
My tenure home, which was awarded way back in 2008, is within the Interactive Media and Games Division of the School of Cinematic Arts.

69
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:12,966
And so that is one of the two major schools at USC that make up the collaborative

70
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:21,005
cross-campus USC Games program. Today I'm here to talk about my games that I've released

71
00:04:22,486 --> 00:04:29,471
commercially through my work at the Game Innovation Lab. So in 2017 I released Walden,

72
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:35,034
a game which is a six-hour long open world translation of Henry David Thoreau's Walden

73
00:04:35,135 --> 00:04:35,895
or Life in the Woods.

74
00:04:36,956 --> 00:04:50,355
And so this game was first released on itch.io and then on PlayStation and Steam, and by the time of this viewing should have been released on Xbox. So you can check that out.

75
00:04:52,277 --> 00:04:58,140
Along with my earlier game, The Night Journey, which was a collaboration with the media artist Bill Viola,

76
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:05,383
these were two of the first four games released through the USC Games publishing label.

77
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:08,905
So this is a publishing label that we have through the program.

78
00:05:10,026 --> 00:05:15,590
that offers opportunities for students, faculty, and innovative independent designers to have their

79
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:20,434
non-traditional games released to the marketplace. We think of it as something like

80
00:05:20,974 --> 00:05:26,098
you would have a publishing label through a university. This is a publishing games label

81
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:31,723
through our university. So I'll pass it to Dave. Looking forward to having a discussion today.

82
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:33,651
Thanks, Tracy.

83
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:34,571
Hi, everybody.

84
00:05:34,631 --> 00:05:35,612
My name is Dave Beck.

85
00:05:36,312 --> 00:05:40,134
I am a full professor at the University of Wisconsin Stout.

86
00:05:41,195 --> 00:05:43,176
And within the School of Art and Design,

87
00:05:43,396 --> 00:05:45,837
I'm the founding director for the game design program

88
00:05:45,917 --> 00:05:46,677
at Stout as well.

89
00:05:47,358 --> 00:05:49,979
I'm actually now more in the directorial role

90
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:52,540
for the school, as well as an upper administration.

91
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:56,062
I'm actually in now a one-year interim position

92
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:57,763
as associate provost for the campus.

93
00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:02,424
So, really looking forward to applying some of my game design background

94
00:06:02,464 --> 00:06:04,765
to new types of systems across the entire campus.

95
00:06:05,925 --> 00:06:08,346
My background is really in pure art.

96
00:06:08,466 --> 00:06:12,327
Lots of modeling, animation, world building.

97
00:06:13,527 --> 00:06:16,688
The two games I'm probably going to be talking about the most today are Tombow.

98
00:06:17,348 --> 00:06:19,928
It's an interactive, essentially an interactive film

99
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:23,349
that has elements of history and environmentalism

100
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:27,770
focused around a river on, kind of in the upper Midwest.

101
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:33,373
And I spent a number of years just working on that as a solo artist and designer for the game,

102
00:06:33,953 --> 00:06:38,235
creating that and releasing it as that interactive experience on Steam and Itch.

103
00:06:38,996 --> 00:06:43,198
And then I'll also hopefully talk a little bit about Distilled as well, my current project.

104
00:06:43,878 --> 00:06:49,421
As of right now, this presentation that you're watching, this is on Kickstarter as we speak,

105
00:06:49,841 --> 00:06:51,582
and I've been working on this over the last couple of years.

106
00:06:51,602 --> 00:06:52,442
This actually started...

107
00:06:52,882 --> 00:06:56,785
as a project in Scotland, where I was doing quite a lot of research,

108
00:06:57,966 --> 00:06:59,787
ended up deciding to create a board game.

109
00:06:59,807 --> 00:07:02,269
So kind of jumping between those different worlds,

110
00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:04,051
much like Chris had mentioned as well.

111
00:07:05,031 --> 00:07:06,192
So that's me.

112
00:07:06,312 --> 00:07:10,175
And again, I'm really excited to be here to talk with everybody today.

113
00:07:10,515 --> 00:07:11,916
And I'm going to hand it back to you, Bob.

114
00:07:12,577 --> 00:07:13,157
Yeah, awesome.

115
00:07:13,177 --> 00:07:13,818
That's excellent.

116
00:07:13,898 --> 00:07:17,000
And as you can tell, we had a lot of fun preparing for this session

117
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,783
and sharing our stories as academic game development journeys, obviously.

118
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:27,915
bind us together. And as we were sharing these, well, for lack of a better word, war stories,

119
00:07:28,475 --> 00:07:34,081
we quickly realized that we needed a structure to keep ourselves on track and to avoid too lengthy

120
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:40,927
tangents during the session. So as we're all professors, we ended up making a diagram that

121
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:46,192
they've turned into a wonderful illustration. So as we pull it up here.

122
00:07:46,654 --> 00:07:52,859
In a nutshell, being an academic game developer puts you in between the field and academia. So

123
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:58,563
ideally, there's a strong exchange with the field as you introduce it within the university

124
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:03,427
structure and your program. And we identified these six key elements in doing this, which we

125
00:08:03,467 --> 00:08:09,132
will be used to drive our discussion today. However, before we do that, we should probably

126
00:08:09,172 --> 00:08:10,673
discuss the big elephant in the room.

127
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:13,035
Why on earth would somebody want to do this?

128
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,177
You know, we could, we could all be indie game developers

129
00:08:15,217 --> 00:08:17,398
making games or professors writing papers

130
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:20,721
about game design and make life a bit easier on ourselves.

131
00:08:20,781 --> 00:08:21,001
Right?

132
00:08:21,061 --> 00:08:23,803
So why did we decide to do this guys?

133
00:08:27,326 --> 00:08:28,187
Well, I can jump in.

134
00:08:28,267 --> 00:08:28,787
I'll jump in.

135
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:32,310
Cause I think I might've started pretty earlier.

136
00:08:34,877 --> 00:08:59,468
You know, for me, one of the reasons to go to academia, coming out of industry, was that I had seen a model of other art forms where people had done really truly experimental work, you know, new genre defining work within the confines of the university within sort of, you know, a place where new ideas and taking risk was

137
00:09:00,468 --> 00:09:01,649
valuable, right?

138
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:04,910
Sometimes that's not true in a purely commercial setting.

139
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,591
And even in indie work in the arts,

140
00:09:07,771 --> 00:09:10,752
it's very difficult to be truly experimental.

141
00:09:10,872 --> 00:09:15,093
So, you know, one of my motivations for going to academia

142
00:09:15,113 --> 00:09:18,795
and starting my research lab was that I wanted to make

143
00:09:18,855 --> 00:09:23,156
things that were outside the norms of, you know,

144
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:27,840
what you could experiment with, you know, sort of on the edges of the game industry,

145
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:32,083
I want to go into full experimentation mode. So that was that was one of my motivations. So

146
00:09:32,524 --> 00:09:39,129
I don't think I realized it would be as hard as it has been. But, but it was one of my core

147
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:45,033
motivations for even going to USC in the first place. Right. Yeah, I think what the way it worked

148
00:09:45,073 --> 00:09:48,876
for me was was was somewhat similar, because for me, it was also about I just want to

149
00:09:49,527 --> 00:09:51,827
I just want to be able to make the games that I want to make.

150
00:09:51,968 --> 00:09:54,889
I want to experiment and push things as much as I can

151
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:59,030
as an artist, rather than having to be commercially dependent

152
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,351
on whatever I end up making.

153
00:10:01,091 --> 00:10:03,732
And I think for me, that's the biggest, especially

154
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:06,313
on tenure track, once you've got your tenure sorted out.

155
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,394
And that's something I'm sure we'll discuss later on as well.

156
00:10:08,814 --> 00:10:10,654
But once that's sorted out, it gives you

157
00:10:10,794 --> 00:10:12,975
a lot of freedom to some extent.

158
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:13,976
Maybe not.

159
00:10:13,996 --> 00:10:15,796
I mean, what are your experiences with that, guys?

160
00:10:16,957 --> 00:10:16,977
I.

161
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:32,415
I'm similar background. My background is in, you know, architecture and the arts. And when I was in school, you know, we had professors, even operating their own firms within the School of Architecture and

162
00:10:33,444 --> 00:10:36,165
doing both industry work and academic work.

163
00:10:36,565 --> 00:10:38,886
So this is something that is very familiar to me.

164
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:42,508
I've always thought that game development

165
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:45,169
seemed like it fit neatly

166
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:47,770
within a more studio art style practice

167
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:52,792
where you are doing your work, creative work,

168
00:10:53,092 --> 00:10:55,173
and that becomes part of your validation,

169
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:57,894
but then also, you know, you do the,

170
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:00,991
typical work of an academic.

171
00:11:01,491 --> 00:11:03,793
So those are things that I was,

172
00:11:04,853 --> 00:11:06,615
I wanted to find a place that would allow me

173
00:11:06,675 --> 00:11:08,136
to do that kind of stuff.

174
00:11:08,316 --> 00:11:11,178
Other points that do strike me

175
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:13,920
as really important in this job too though,

176
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:17,682
is that, you know, I think this helps me certainly

177
00:11:17,903 --> 00:11:20,124
with credibility in the classroom.

178
00:11:20,945 --> 00:11:22,626
You know, there was a time before

179
00:11:22,706 --> 00:11:24,887
I was doing quite as much indie development,

180
00:11:24,907 --> 00:11:26,609
but maybe I was just teaching the software

181
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:27,789
where somebody might be like,

182
00:11:28,322 --> 00:11:30,686
Well, why should I listen to you? You've never published a

183
00:11:30,706 --> 00:11:33,470
game before. And now, you know, with my own independent

184
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,655
practice, the students like that's not even really a factor.

185
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:40,000
You know, the students will be like, well, yeah, we know that

186
00:11:40,221 --> 00:11:42,344
you did these did these things.

187
00:11:44,043 --> 00:11:46,385
You know, and then again, the creative freedom aspect.

188
00:11:47,426 --> 00:11:48,767
Frankly, in a practical sense,

189
00:11:49,468 --> 00:11:51,770
the academic job pays my bills.

190
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:56,355
And then I don't have to rely on the commercial performance

191
00:11:56,395 --> 00:11:57,135
of some of my games.

192
00:11:57,296 --> 00:12:00,118
I can make weird experimental stuff.

193
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,641
I can go from tabletop to video game.

194
00:12:02,941 --> 00:12:05,223
I mean, I'm working on a Game Boy game right now.

195
00:12:07,746 --> 00:12:16,215
as a side project. And I can do that because I can put out a broad scope of things based

196
00:12:16,295 --> 00:12:17,637
on just experiments I want to do.

197
00:12:18,724 --> 00:12:22,705
Yeah, and a little bit contrary to some of the responses,

198
00:12:23,246 --> 00:12:24,306
I kind of fell into it.

199
00:12:24,626 --> 00:12:28,067
I tripped and fell into a giant puddle of game design.

200
00:12:28,847 --> 00:12:31,668
That sounds messy, and I guess it is kind of messy.

201
00:12:31,728 --> 00:12:35,890
But I decided to be, actually, from the beginning,

202
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:40,031
I have always wanted to be teaching in higher education

203
00:12:40,271 --> 00:12:41,091
and being a professor.

204
00:12:41,412 --> 00:12:42,932
Originally thinking it was going to be more art,

205
00:12:42,972 --> 00:12:44,713
traditional art, sculpture was my background.

206
00:12:45,373 --> 00:12:47,635
But my love of technology and games

207
00:12:48,075 --> 00:12:49,897
just started to kind of intertwine

208
00:12:50,177 --> 00:12:52,299
with my interest in research.

209
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,381
And so I went from being a sculpture instructor

210
00:12:55,501 --> 00:12:58,604
to a 3D modeling instructor to a game design instructor.

211
00:12:59,584 --> 00:13:02,227
And so my research practice has followed that as well.

212
00:13:02,307 --> 00:13:05,729
So a little bit different, but like many of you have said,

213
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:09,452
it's probably more complex a route than perhaps, definitely

214
00:13:09,492 --> 00:13:10,613
more complex than others.

215
00:13:10,693 --> 00:13:13,015
But I wouldn't trade it for anything.

216
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:16,461
That's actually interesting that I didn't know that value. But

217
00:13:16,521 --> 00:13:18,942
like that, that kind of resonates with me as well.

218
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:22,644
Because like, well, as being, you know, from Europe, higher

219
00:13:22,684 --> 00:13:26,406
education is pretty affordable. So I just get, you know, I got

220
00:13:26,426 --> 00:13:28,888
my master's, I'm like, well, I could get a PhD now. And I just

221
00:13:28,928 --> 00:13:31,689
kept going. And then I had a PhD. And I was like, well, let's

222
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:35,331
try for a professor. You know, it kind of just kept going like

223
00:13:35,351 --> 00:13:37,973
because I've always wanted to make games like ever since I was

224
00:13:38,013 --> 00:13:39,874
eight years old, I've been making games.

225
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,271
But yeah, just getting the degree

226
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,512
since it wasn't super expensive in Europe,

227
00:13:45,553 --> 00:13:46,894
that kind of put me in this position

228
00:13:46,934 --> 00:13:48,255
where I ended up doing this.

229
00:13:49,055 --> 00:13:50,876
Yeah, go ahead.

230
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:51,797
I was gonna say real quick,

231
00:13:51,837 --> 00:13:55,799
I do wanna jump on and validate the point

232
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,320
and echo the point that you just said

233
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,962
where you were like, I just wanted to make games.

234
00:14:02,349 --> 00:14:06,771
With all the professional answers, I mean, there is a big element of this for me where it was like,

235
00:14:06,871 --> 00:14:12,233
no, I am making video games. Hear that nine-year-old me? Like we're making video games now.

236
00:14:14,674 --> 00:14:21,096
Totally. All right. Well, I think that was great to open everything. Let's look at that diagram

237
00:14:21,136 --> 00:14:26,579
that we're talking about and address the six key topics. And we decided to do this chronologically

238
00:14:26,619 --> 00:14:30,720
for everybody watching. So, you know, when we start these projects, when we want that academic

239
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,100
freedom.

240
00:14:31,981 --> 00:14:34,102
we need funding to start making our game though.

241
00:14:34,142 --> 00:14:37,003
So panelists, what's your advice regarding funding?

242
00:14:40,725 --> 00:14:42,926
Oh, well, I'll start this one

243
00:14:42,946 --> 00:14:44,506
cause it's gonna be probably be different

244
00:14:44,866 --> 00:14:45,647
than some of the others.

245
00:14:47,227 --> 00:14:50,289
So again, kind of falling back on that artist mode

246
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:52,489
because that's my background, what I knew

247
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,970
when I approached making Tombow,

248
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,911
I actually didn't think that much about funding

249
00:14:56,931 --> 00:14:58,812
which probably might've been a mistake.

250
00:14:59,512 --> 00:15:01,935
But what I thought about is money and funding was time.

251
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:02,695
I needed time.

252
00:15:02,876 --> 00:15:05,438
I needed to figure out how to have dedicated time

253
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:06,359
outside of teaching.

254
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,761
So for my approach, and I say this

255
00:15:08,781 --> 00:15:10,924
because there might be some of you out there watching this,

256
00:15:11,404 --> 00:15:12,785
I actually decided to just apply

257
00:15:12,825 --> 00:15:14,367
for a number of artist residencies.

258
00:15:14,767 --> 00:15:19,130
where I could essentially have a month, two months, three months, where all I'm doing,

259
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:24,052
I'm in literally a cabin in the woods or some other institution somewhere else, where I'm

260
00:15:24,112 --> 00:15:25,233
able to just focus on that.

261
00:15:25,273 --> 00:15:28,434
So that was one big approach that I decided to take.

262
00:15:30,355 --> 00:15:33,997
Obviously later I did need to find funding to support some of the vision I had

263
00:15:34,677 --> 00:15:36,958
but to get it going and really for the

264
00:15:37,818 --> 00:15:42,760
A good majority of that project was done at these residencies where all I'm doing is waking up

265
00:15:43,461 --> 00:15:48,343
Making work going to bed seven days and it's like heaven. The idea is just heaven to me

266
00:15:49,403 --> 00:15:51,925
And so yeah, I don't regret that.

267
00:15:52,165 --> 00:15:54,466
I've really loved being able to take advantage of that

268
00:15:54,947 --> 00:15:58,529
in my projects to have nothing else outside distractions.

269
00:15:58,849 --> 00:16:01,010
So not necessarily a good answer to your question,

270
00:16:01,031 --> 00:16:02,832
but a different type of funding this time for me.

271
00:16:04,693 --> 00:16:04,853
Right.

272
00:16:05,193 --> 00:16:07,975
Yeah, I mean, for me, it was also not necessarily

273
00:16:08,015 --> 00:16:09,636
like finding the big pot of money.

274
00:16:10,616 --> 00:16:12,758
Is that an R2, it's less research intense.

275
00:16:12,818 --> 00:16:15,499
So even though Miami has some support for finding grants,

276
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,501
it's minimal in comparison to R1s.

277
00:16:18,884 --> 00:16:21,245
But my position at Miami did come with an endowment.

278
00:16:21,265 --> 00:16:24,007
So I had some money every year that I could use

279
00:16:24,087 --> 00:16:25,127
for creative pursuits.

280
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:26,608
So that was really helpful.

281
00:16:27,408 --> 00:16:30,710
But for me, it was mostly applying for some internal grants

282
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,311
like a research leave, a summer scholarship,

283
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:34,912
those types of things.

284
00:16:35,092 --> 00:16:36,813
But when I started Brukle,

285
00:16:37,313 --> 00:16:38,614
I think it was mostly a matter of like,

286
00:16:38,634 --> 00:16:39,994
well, I wanna make this game regardless

287
00:16:40,014 --> 00:16:41,075
and I've had no money to do it.

288
00:16:41,095 --> 00:16:43,736
I'll still make it over the weekends.

289
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:44,677
In hindsight.

290
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,502
I think one of the things that I would like to do on a future game is look for more money

291
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:50,042
for it.

292
00:16:50,502 --> 00:16:54,284
In my background, when I was working in a research lab back in Belgium before I moved

293
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:59,707
to the United States, we used to go get the big pots of grants and it was like with an

294
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:03,168
entire research lab, like, okay, we're going to get a grant of half a million to a million

295
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,009
dollars and we make games for health.

296
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:09,892
But again, even though Brukel has a very strong educational component, I think it would be

297
00:17:10,472 --> 00:17:13,233
a lot harder to find that kind of money rather than.

298
00:17:13,612 --> 00:17:17,154
when you're doing a game for health type of project.

299
00:17:17,534 --> 00:17:19,675
So for me, it was very intentional.

300
00:17:19,755 --> 00:17:21,396
Let's see what I can do if I have no money.

301
00:17:22,016 --> 00:17:24,138
And then afterwards, if that goes well,

302
00:17:24,358 --> 00:17:26,699
it will only get better when I start looking for games

303
00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:27,960
that might be more fundable.

304
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,561
But it's always going to be a little bit of that balance.

305
00:17:30,581 --> 00:17:31,022
I don't know.

306
00:17:32,443 --> 00:17:35,344
I think it's also interesting to, once again,

307
00:17:36,505 --> 00:17:37,506
highlight a point you made.

308
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:42,612
a lot of the funding does seem to be in games for something.

309
00:17:43,572 --> 00:17:47,373
And I think one of the points that have come up

310
00:17:47,613 --> 00:17:50,434
in our discussion is that sometimes these games

311
00:17:50,554 --> 00:17:54,396
aren't necessarily games for something, they are games

312
00:17:54,516 --> 00:17:56,136
and they might have some other component,

313
00:17:56,677 --> 00:17:59,098
but they don't necessarily fit neatly

314
00:17:59,138 --> 00:18:03,319
into the games for education, games for health areas.

315
00:18:03,979 --> 00:18:07,421
And so like myself, I've gone for,

316
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:16,003
you know, internal grants to do a few game projects. You know, we have access to summer

317
00:18:16,043 --> 00:18:20,564
research scholarships. I haven't really taken advantage of any of those, but you know, that's

318
00:18:20,604 --> 00:18:26,685
something that we do at Kent State. But, and then of course, you know, there's external things.

319
00:18:27,605 --> 00:18:32,046
You know, I'm in the early discussion stages of an NEH grant and things like that, but

320
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:41,579
you know, part of what we do is, you know, I've utilized like elements of our program to also

321
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:48,542
assist. So same sort of thing where it's like you're not necessarily going for formal funding,

322
00:18:48,602 --> 00:18:53,785
but there are already these mechanisms in place that'll give you student help, you know, the

323
00:18:53,825 --> 00:18:59,268
ability to have students get compensated for their time in the summer and things like that.

324
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:01,609
And then of course, you know, I've also done.

325
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:08,273
more industry-based funding. Again, both the projects I'm talking about today are Kickstarter

326
00:19:08,293 --> 00:19:16,559
funded. So that does give a little bit of freedom in the subject matter of games, I think, sometimes.

327
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:17,800
Yeah.

328
00:19:18,456 --> 00:19:26,679
Yeah, I think that's a really great point. And what I'm hearing resonates a lot with the early

329
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:37,702
days of my project. So I started making Walden back in 2007, right? And there was no sort of

330
00:19:38,722 --> 00:19:41,443
funding available for a game like Walden at that time.

331
00:19:42,624 --> 00:19:49,811
I will say that we had gotten funding for The Night Journey back in 2005 through the NEA,

332
00:19:49,851 --> 00:19:54,835
but that was through Bill Viola and it was a media arts grant.

333
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,516
He's a well-recognized artist.

334
00:19:56,557 --> 00:20:01,060
There was a whole path there for a media artist who wanted to make a game.

335
00:20:02,382 --> 00:20:05,265
there was no path for a game designer who wanted to make an art game.

336
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:10,910
And so we did have early funding there for the prototype of Night Journey.

337
00:20:11,451 --> 00:20:15,134
But when I set out to make Walden on my own, there was nothing.

338
00:20:15,175 --> 00:20:18,818
I mean, I could have applied, I don't know, for some grant in the sciences

339
00:20:18,858 --> 00:20:22,382
to make a game, maybe about global warming at Walden, right?

340
00:20:22,402 --> 00:20:22,902
Or something like that.

341
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:24,384
But that's not the game I wanted to make.

342
00:20:24,904 --> 00:20:28,608
In fact, the team talked a lot about this. Should we go for the funding that's out there?

343
00:20:29,088 --> 00:20:36,534
Should we sort of turn the vision of the game in order to fit into a category of grant? We actually

344
00:20:36,574 --> 00:20:41,299
decided not to, and so we went without funding for the first five years of the project. It was all

345
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:47,244
volunteer work, and we did get a really nice little like $25,000 internal USC grant, which

346
00:20:51,187 --> 00:20:55,794
you know, that's not a lot when, you know, but it paid for some things,

347
00:20:56,535 --> 00:20:57,816
some students and things like that.

348
00:20:59,573 --> 00:21:09,539
And then it was really what one of the things I would advise, and this is, you know, just happenstance, but I think it's because we're all out there doing things, is that the world changed.

349
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:25,110
And people start, you know, they start, there were decisions on the Supreme Court about what games are and what kind of, you know, sort of creative speech they are, and there were, you know, changes inside of the organizations that provide grants, right?

350
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,711
So during the time that we were working.

351
00:21:30,106 --> 00:21:31,787
These grants from the NEH came,

352
00:21:31,827 --> 00:21:34,407
Digital Projects for the Public became possible.

353
00:21:34,687 --> 00:21:37,468
The NEA included video games specifically

354
00:21:37,508 --> 00:21:38,948
in their call for media arts grants.

355
00:21:39,188 --> 00:21:40,909
These things began to change, right?

356
00:21:41,389 --> 00:21:43,769
So while things may seem hopeless when you begin,

357
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:47,130
if you work hard, what we wound up having

358
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,351
was a super articulate prototype

359
00:21:49,931 --> 00:21:52,351
when those opportunities arose,

360
00:21:52,631 --> 00:21:54,412
and we were able to apply for the NEH

361
00:21:54,452 --> 00:21:56,292
and the NEA grants that were coming.

362
00:21:56,992 --> 00:22:04,534
you know, to life during our work. And, you know, as Dave said, that money made it possible for us to

363
00:22:04,814 --> 00:22:08,275
really build our vision out. I mean, if they hadn't come at that time, we probably would

364
00:22:08,295 --> 00:22:12,136
have finished our little game. It would have been like a lot of academic games. It would have been

365
00:22:12,176 --> 00:22:18,337
sort of, you know, of a certain quality, right? But we really had a vision for a commercial game.

366
00:22:18,957 --> 00:22:24,538
And those grants allowed us to build that vision out and to really polish and

367
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:30,041
make sure that the and work with scholars and historians in a way that we couldn't otherwise so

368
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:34,664
so I guess one of my advices for people you know who are out there saying oh no one's funding games

369
00:22:34,704 --> 00:22:42,209
like mine is that's okay keep going right yeah yeah no one's funding it yet right not yet exactly

370
00:22:42,229 --> 00:22:49,073
yeah yeah awesome awesome um so let's move on to the next topic that we have to address what how

371
00:22:49,093 --> 00:22:53,495
does your process change when you're doing this within a university context what is

372
00:22:53,859 --> 00:22:56,260
What is different about is what's unique about it.

373
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,421
So let's talk a little bit about that.

374
00:22:59,082 --> 00:22:59,922
It's slow.

375
00:23:02,344 --> 00:23:03,404
It's slow.

376
00:23:03,584 --> 00:23:05,045
I mean, I come from industry, right?

377
00:23:05,185 --> 00:23:08,827
So, you know, we would make these, you know,

378
00:23:08,927 --> 00:23:11,889
massive games and ship them, ship them and get them out.

379
00:23:11,949 --> 00:23:13,189
You know, we were always building

380
00:23:13,229 --> 00:23:14,470
our technology infrastructure

381
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,611
and our team was getting like more and more experience.

382
00:23:17,032 --> 00:23:19,093
And in academia, you have this situation

383
00:23:19,133 --> 00:23:20,273
where you're working with students.

384
00:23:20,914 --> 00:23:23,495
Maybe at most they can give you 10, 15 hours a week.

385
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,035
I mean, that's the extreme.

386
00:23:25,075 --> 00:23:28,817
But then they start crunching on their capstone projects and you lose them.

387
00:23:28,877 --> 00:23:31,938
And then you got to train a whole new group of students every couple of years.

388
00:23:31,998 --> 00:23:34,239
You know, they sort of transition out.

389
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,860
And you yourself.

390
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,281
I mean, Dave's list of things that he's doing.

391
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:42,582
I was laughing when you were saying it because I was on that track too.

392
00:23:42,602 --> 00:23:43,443
I was, you know, chair.

393
00:23:44,223 --> 00:24:08,080
director of the whole USC Games program, blah, I was like, you know, dying, right? So how do you do that? And how many hours do you eke out a week to spend on your own project, right? So the whole thing has to become this extended experience that is not, you know, I mean, obviously, in industry, they work long, hard hours on games, but that's what they get to do. You are working long, hard hours on games.

394
00:24:08,696 --> 00:24:09,917
and you were running departments,

395
00:24:10,257 --> 00:24:16,081
and you were grading and teaching and all that stuff, right?

396
00:24:16,662 --> 00:24:18,203
And that's funny you say that, Tracy,

397
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:19,283
because that's exactly right.

398
00:24:19,323 --> 00:24:21,585
I mean, for me with Tombow,

399
00:24:21,665 --> 00:24:23,887
I think I took about three, three and a half years

400
00:24:24,227 --> 00:24:26,749
to make it, and I said, I'm gonna do this on my own.

401
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:33,393
that artist mindset. I'm going solo on this and for the most part I did and it

402
00:24:33,453 --> 00:24:37,636
took longer but I was yeah chair at the time and then director for the school

403
00:24:38,256 --> 00:24:43,860
and I had to literally put it on ice for six months right deep storage and then

404
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:49,104
summer would come and I just furiously go but it was interesting to talking

405
00:24:49,144 --> 00:24:51,185
about process is that

406
00:24:52,506 --> 00:24:55,367
for the second time around for the game I'm working on now,

407
00:24:55,487 --> 00:24:57,187
very different of course with a board game.

408
00:24:57,247 --> 00:24:58,868
But I knew from the beginning,

409
00:24:59,008 --> 00:25:00,148
what I'd learned from Tombow is,

410
00:25:00,368 --> 00:25:02,289
I am never doing a project just on my own again.

411
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:03,970
I just, I need a team.

412
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:07,251
I kind of graduated from the artist mindset,

413
00:25:07,271 --> 00:25:09,251
which is very much doing this on my own,

414
00:25:09,691 --> 00:25:11,392
to more of a developer's mindset

415
00:25:11,432 --> 00:25:14,293
where a team we can accomplish things faster,

416
00:25:14,553 --> 00:25:15,513
better, more efficiently.

417
00:25:15,553 --> 00:25:18,094
But most importantly, in my perspective,

418
00:25:18,814 --> 00:25:21,436
We all have our different skill sets that we're bringing to the table,

419
00:25:21,837 --> 00:25:23,058
and it's just going to be that much better.

420
00:25:23,258 --> 00:25:24,319
We're all doing that much better.

421
00:25:24,819 --> 00:25:26,320
So yeah, I would agree, slow.

422
00:25:27,221 --> 00:25:28,742
Summer is my friend.

423
00:25:29,003 --> 00:25:30,264
I really do focus on that.

424
00:25:30,284 --> 00:25:32,065
With a teaching-focused school like Stout,

425
00:25:32,225 --> 00:25:34,987
so much of our time is dedicated to the classroom during the school year.

426
00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:37,690
So yeah, I echo that.

427
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:42,133
I would say molasses, red tape, hoops, all of those things at an institution

428
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:46,257
definitely, unfortunately, infiltrate into the game development process too.

429
00:25:47,037 --> 00:25:47,378
Yeah.

430
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,202
I think, you know, because what resonates a lot with what you just said, Dave, for me,

431
00:25:51,262 --> 00:25:53,003
is like the solo part of it.

432
00:25:53,444 --> 00:25:56,806
Like I'm, I don't think I will ever be doing a game entirely by myself.

433
00:25:57,186 --> 00:26:01,209
Um, again, because, uh, you know, I had a lot of roles to cover as well, um, as a

434
00:26:01,229 --> 00:26:05,992
professor and I think what I should definitely have done better is the life

435
00:26:06,012 --> 00:26:10,235
work balance part of it, because it really becomes a lot, you end up doing

436
00:26:10,275 --> 00:26:12,537
these insane hours and like, I mean.

437
00:26:12,977 --> 00:26:14,197
I got a burnout through it.

438
00:26:14,217 --> 00:26:17,478
Like, I don't know if I would be divorced right now if I hadn't done all that,

439
00:26:17,638 --> 00:26:19,699
even like it's, it's been pretty rough.

440
00:26:19,879 --> 00:26:22,879
And I think one of the things that you want to take into account is just like,

441
00:26:22,899 --> 00:26:26,481
yeah, you, you want to make sure you get help from other people that can take

442
00:26:26,581 --> 00:26:27,921
certain parts out of your hands.

443
00:26:28,321 --> 00:26:31,482
Cause even if I look at Bruko right now, I'm like, If only I could have spent

444
00:26:31,522 --> 00:26:36,263
more time on the marketing, but like, I, you know, I've already got a burnout for

445
00:26:36,323 --> 00:26:36,764
it, like, right.

446
00:26:36,784 --> 00:26:38,664
And I'm still feeling like I should have pushed harder.

447
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:42,705
So I think for me personally, and I know that's a very personal thing, but.

448
00:26:43,207 --> 00:26:45,969
like making sure that your process involves

449
00:26:45,989 --> 00:26:47,390
your life work balance.

450
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,430
I think that is the thing

451
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,531
that I should have done a lot better.

452
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:52,152
Aside from that, I think for me,

453
00:26:52,192 --> 00:26:53,693
it was a pretty straightforward process.

454
00:26:53,733 --> 00:26:55,714
Like I tried to do it as much as I could

455
00:26:56,555 --> 00:26:58,436
as I would have done it if I weren't a professor.

456
00:26:58,776 --> 00:26:59,716
But at the same time,

457
00:26:59,937 --> 00:27:01,818
it's something that you have to be very aware of

458
00:27:01,898 --> 00:27:04,219
that you are doing two different jobs

459
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:05,440
at the same time almost,

460
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,841
and you need to cut yourself some slack a lot there.

461
00:27:07,861 --> 00:27:11,043
So I think that would be my biggest advisor.

462
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:14,974
you know, 2020 hindsight thought about doing all this.

463
00:27:15,975 --> 00:27:17,596
Yeah.

464
00:27:17,757 --> 00:27:20,660
The way I balance it, too, is I try

465
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,363
to do something for the game every day,

466
00:27:23,563 --> 00:27:25,806
even if that's like I make a few sprites.

467
00:27:27,568 --> 00:27:28,449
You know, having that.

468
00:27:29,552 --> 00:27:33,896
constant progression is nice, especially, you know,

469
00:27:34,276 --> 00:27:37,119
with Nemo, like we're hand animating it, right?

470
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:41,803
So if I can get a few frames in, it's really helpful.

471
00:27:42,224 --> 00:27:44,706
And one of the things that you all mentioned,

472
00:27:44,846 --> 00:27:46,187
the collaborative part of it,

473
00:27:47,288 --> 00:27:49,250
what I like about working on teams, especially,

474
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:51,191
and with my current project.

475
00:27:51,817 --> 00:27:56,538
I'm working with non-academics as well.

476
00:27:56,678 --> 00:28:00,079
And we start to keep each other kind of honest.

477
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:03,219
You know, if I go down an academic rabbit hole,

478
00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:05,800
they're the one that can push me back and be like,

479
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,861
but it's gotta be good for speed runners.

480
00:28:10,001 --> 00:28:12,561
You know, something that like, I'm not even thinking about.

481
00:28:13,422 --> 00:28:21,106
Sorry, speedrunners. But then, you know, on the flip side, I'm

482
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:26,468
the one who can also be like, well, you know, here's how we

483
00:28:26,528 --> 00:28:29,810
should approach the art. And here's how this can become

484
00:28:30,371 --> 00:28:35,435
a study of this media, and then that becomes the thing we end up getting pressed for.

485
00:28:35,855 --> 00:28:41,340
So that collaborative element is really good. I totally agree with Bob that, you know,

486
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:47,305
something's going to fall off. For me, it was also definitely marketing. And yes, you know,

487
00:28:47,645 --> 00:28:53,289
please take care of yourself. You know, for me with three kids, like I can't afford not to.

488
00:28:53,309 --> 00:28:55,091
I just want to say that's

489
00:28:58,524 --> 00:29:01,465
what you just said, Bob, about you might not be divorced.

490
00:29:01,525 --> 00:29:02,626
I mean, that really touched me.

491
00:29:04,347 --> 00:29:07,209
My experience, I actually have never done a game,

492
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:08,490
well, board games,

493
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,732
but I have never done a digital game just by myself.

494
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:11,992
I'm very team oriented.

495
00:29:12,873 --> 00:29:15,955
And I actually got sick partially,

496
00:29:16,635 --> 00:29:18,677
partway through the development of Walden.

497
00:29:18,737 --> 00:29:22,159
I had breast cancer and had to go through chemo

498
00:29:22,199 --> 00:29:23,380
and radiation and surgery

499
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,881
and all those great, wonderful things.

500
00:29:25,001 --> 00:29:26,722
And because I had this team,

501
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,230
I thought the game was going to stop.

502
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:33,631
And it was the most wonderful thing I've ever experienced is that they kept going.

503
00:29:34,611 --> 00:29:38,292
You know, um, when I couldn't come in and when I just didn't have the energy,

504
00:29:38,352 --> 00:29:42,694
they kept going, it was actually extraordinary to, to experience.

505
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:46,174
And that I, even though this is like one of the worst periods of my life, it was

506
00:29:46,334 --> 00:29:53,116
also, um, really a wonderful thing to have experienced the dedication of that team.

507
00:29:53,716 --> 00:29:53,916
Wow.

508
00:29:53,956 --> 00:29:54,316
Yeah.

509
00:29:54,396 --> 00:29:57,217
Actually, now you mentioned that because I had some students that, you know,

510
00:29:57,745 --> 00:30:01,569
I had in class at the time and some of them contributed like a 3D model left and right

511
00:30:01,589 --> 00:30:02,089
for the game.

512
00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:05,552
And, you know, I have a lot of support from them as well.

513
00:30:05,592 --> 00:30:09,055
It's, you know, it's definitely something I should mention as well.

514
00:30:10,056 --> 00:30:12,438
It was heartwarming to see how much support you can get.

515
00:30:12,892 --> 00:30:15,953
in that way while you're going through hell and back.

516
00:30:16,113 --> 00:30:20,035
And I wonder if we would have received those kinds of support

517
00:30:20,175 --> 00:30:24,296
if we had been in a commercial or indie studio, right?

518
00:30:24,457 --> 00:30:28,598
So my dean just said, whatever you need, right?

519
00:30:29,379 --> 00:30:35,381
And I think that's something specific to academia

520
00:30:36,282 --> 00:30:37,542
when you go through a crisis like that.

521
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:41,599
That's interesting. Yeah, I wonder, I hope that the people

522
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,087
watching this, especially if you're on the tenure track, or

523
00:30:45,107 --> 00:30:46,170
you're thinking about that.

524
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:51,601
Again, Tracy talked about advice earlier in another response.

525
00:30:51,681 --> 00:30:56,044
And I think that don't be afraid to reach out to others for support.

526
00:30:57,165 --> 00:31:01,808
I think it's so important to to seek that and don't think you have to do it

527
00:31:01,848 --> 00:31:04,950
just because you're going up for tenure, that you have to do this on your own.

528
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:08,973
And I think we'll see less of that as games evolve.

529
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:12,135
But still, I think that's important to note, too. Right.

530
00:31:12,836 --> 00:31:27,224
Well, let's move on to the next topic and that one is ownership. So how did that work for you guys, the university take all the revenue or, you know, do you see some return on all the time you invest into the project as well. How did that work out.

531
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:31,226
Anyone want to jump in.

532
00:31:32,247 --> 00:31:33,528
So I can I can start

533
00:31:34,828 --> 00:31:37,090
At Kent, we have a collective bargaining agreement.

534
00:31:38,373 --> 00:31:47,319
which says that it defines anything like this as a work and stipulates that it is the property of

535
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:55,465
the faculty member. So this is again one of the things that attracted me to this position in

536
00:31:55,505 --> 00:32:02,710
particular. I've worked for universities where that was not the case, so you you know would maybe try

537
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:05,932
to cordon things off in a certain way, but

538
00:32:07,028 --> 00:32:14,772
Part of our agreement, but also what has shaped the culture where I am, is that because we own

539
00:32:14,792 --> 00:32:22,496
the work, they actively advise us to do stuff like this, because if we're happy in creating work,

540
00:32:23,056 --> 00:32:31,020
and then can go out and be like, I work at this great place, that is good for the university.

541
00:32:34,476 --> 00:32:38,859
I would, a piece of advice, if you are earlier in your career,

542
00:32:38,879 --> 00:32:43,283
I would say is, and yeah, the academic job market

543
00:32:43,323 --> 00:32:46,425
is what it is, but look into those things

544
00:32:46,886 --> 00:32:52,590
and see what, again, ownership and things like that there

545
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:56,593
might be, because that is an important part of this journey.

546
00:32:59,374 --> 00:33:03,976
Yeah, I'll just chime in. It's pretty much the same at University of Wisconsin-Stout.

547
00:33:04,756 --> 00:33:11,199
I think one asterisk to put on that, though, is that there is, at least in Wisconsin,

548
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:16,101
a very clear law about if a student creates something as part of a class,

549
00:33:16,602 --> 00:33:19,343
then they are having ownership of that. Rightly so, right?

550
00:33:20,964 --> 00:33:24,586
So that's one thing that I kept all of my game development

551
00:33:25,046 --> 00:33:27,888
when I was working with students, if I was on any projects

552
00:33:28,248 --> 00:33:30,630
outside of the classroom as its own independent entity.

553
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:35,433
And then the only other thing I'd say too, and this is kind of one that I'd be

554
00:33:35,493 --> 00:33:37,154
curious to see what other people think about.

555
00:33:38,435 --> 00:33:40,376
I've always been in this weird realm of

556
00:33:41,797 --> 00:33:45,659
I'm using the computer my university has given me.

557
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:47,740
I'm using the software as well.

558
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,561
I'm making a not-for-profit game.

559
00:33:50,581 --> 00:33:52,903
I'm not profiting off of Tombow.

560
00:33:53,303 --> 00:33:55,144
But at the same time, that's one thing

561
00:33:55,164 --> 00:33:57,285
that I know has always been a little bit of a foggy area.

562
00:33:58,306 --> 00:34:00,167
So that's one area that I'd be curious to hear

563
00:34:00,187 --> 00:34:01,127
what others think about, too.

564
00:34:02,228 --> 00:34:02,448
Yeah.

565
00:34:02,868 --> 00:34:03,188
Yeah, sure.

566
00:34:03,368 --> 00:34:06,650
I mean, I actually don't really care

567
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:09,351
about if the game is going to make any money or something.

568
00:34:10,252 --> 00:34:10,492
You know?

569
00:34:10,893 --> 00:34:12,434
I don't need to get additional salary from it

570
00:34:12,454 --> 00:34:14,094
because that's why I'm doing this in the first place

571
00:34:14,114 --> 00:34:15,395
that that's already covered, right?

572
00:34:16,795 --> 00:34:19,916
So I was originally, I had hoped that the university

573
00:34:19,936 --> 00:34:22,597
would just want to publish it,

574
00:34:22,777 --> 00:34:24,978
but they were like, nope, we're not going to do that.

575
00:34:25,018 --> 00:34:26,138
But that means that, you know,

576
00:34:26,518 --> 00:34:28,239
you get to do everything yourself

577
00:34:28,339 --> 00:34:30,859
and you also get the rewards for that.

578
00:34:30,939 --> 00:34:33,320
So I ended up setting up lifelong games

579
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,920
and then publish the game myself.

580
00:34:36,261 --> 00:34:38,622
And that worked out fairly well, I would say.

581
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:42,283
But yeah, Miami, it's a similar principle, I guess,

582
00:34:42,303 --> 00:34:43,804
from what you guys have been talking about.

583
00:34:43,844 --> 00:34:46,604
You can keep the ownership for it pretty easily.

584
00:34:47,565 --> 00:34:49,285
And it worked out that way, but, you know,

585
00:34:49,345 --> 00:34:51,326
it all added into the surprise of how much work

586
00:34:51,346 --> 00:34:52,266
this was actually gonna be,

587
00:34:52,286 --> 00:34:55,007
because now I'm also managing my own company for it.

588
00:34:55,607 --> 00:34:58,668
So yeah, that was definitely a stressful thing to do

589
00:34:59,128 --> 00:35:00,169
when you're not expecting it.

590
00:35:01,329 --> 00:35:03,710
I think this is a really topical issue, by the way,

591
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:04,810
because,

592
00:35:06,394 --> 00:35:11,878
Most universities, most research universities, especially where there are grants involved,

593
00:35:11,938 --> 00:35:19,223
and this is true of USC, do claim ownership if there's federal grants involved, right,

594
00:35:19,844 --> 00:35:29,150
of research and specifically a patentable, what they call inventions, right? There's rarely any,

595
00:35:29,991 --> 00:35:31,932
you know, language around

596
00:35:33,242 --> 00:35:40,890
more copyrightable works, which is where games fall into, right? And at USC, you know, the policy

597
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:47,917
is that basically the university owns patentable works that were created through research grants,

598
00:35:48,077 --> 00:35:56,905
but there are traditional exceptions for works of art. And so it was unclear that the IP policy was

599
00:35:56,925 --> 00:35:57,145
written.

600
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:03,952
in, I think, 2001 or 2000, I don't know, it's like some insane number of years ago.

601
00:36:05,032 --> 00:36:08,914
And in it, it says, you know, exception for works of art.

602
00:36:10,054 --> 00:36:11,815
And then there's also this whole thing on software.

603
00:36:11,835 --> 00:36:11,875
So

604
00:36:11,895 --> 00:36:13,195
Transcribed by https://otter.ai

605
00:36:13,555 --> 00:36:16,136
works of art that are software are not even considered.

606
00:36:17,276 --> 00:36:18,937
And so we had to go through this process

607
00:36:18,997 --> 00:36:22,118
where we actually cleared both,

608
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:26,920
we cleared Walden specifically as a work of art.

609
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,321
Night Journey is obviously a work of art made by an artist.

610
00:36:31,561 --> 00:36:36,523
And so we went through and cleared it as a work of art.

611
00:36:36,543 --> 00:36:40,384
And therefore the rights are retained by me.

612
00:36:40,885 --> 00:36:42,585
And I include the team in that.

613
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:50,440
And then what we decided to do as a team was publish it through USC Games, our publishing label,

614
00:36:51,041 --> 00:37:00,648
and to actually return all of the profits. I can't even call it profits, because it costs so much to make over the years that it's really not profit.

615
00:37:01,768 --> 00:37:09,534
But we return everything that is made by the game to the lab to fund new students and staff in the maintenance of the game.

616
00:37:09,654 --> 00:37:10,895
And, you know, if we ever

617
00:37:11,419 --> 00:37:15,461
got enough to maintain them in making new games, right?

618
00:37:15,841 --> 00:37:18,962
So that's our sort of ecosystem that we determined.

619
00:37:18,982 --> 00:37:20,823
Now we could have another other artists,

620
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:22,203
other game artists like Peter Brinson

621
00:37:23,904 --> 00:37:24,885
does something similar,

622
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:28,346
but we could have just as well decided to take it out

623
00:37:28,366 --> 00:37:30,107
and make a company since we owned it.

624
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:32,688
But we determined that it was more important to us

625
00:37:32,748 --> 00:37:36,529
to maintain this ecosystem at the university for innovation.

626
00:37:36,689 --> 00:37:37,510
So that was our choice.

627
00:37:39,735 --> 00:37:42,677
Dave, you'd mentioned software in particular. And I think this

628
00:37:42,757 --> 00:37:48,722
is one area where it's important to talk up open source software

629
00:37:49,742 --> 00:37:53,525
under my collar shirt that I wore for the presentation the

630
00:37:53,565 --> 00:37:55,506
rest of the day I've been wearing my blender shirt.

631
00:37:56,967 --> 00:37:59,970
Blender now has a 2d tool set, which is what we are animating

632
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:06,094
little Nemo in. So I'm very big on that. But yeah, I mean, we

633
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:07,215
try to

634
00:38:08,868 --> 00:38:13,791
where we can adopt. We try to stay like keep those things

635
00:38:13,971 --> 00:38:17,773
again cordoned off. So we don't fall into any of those muddy

636
00:38:17,853 --> 00:38:24,237
areas. But, you know, and then whenever we do like summer

637
00:38:24,317 --> 00:38:30,341
internships with students, you know, I either have them intern

638
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:35,224
with pixel, please, you know, the the other organization.

639
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:47,886
Or, you know, that is where Pie for Breakfast will act as a separate entity that they are taking the internship with. It's not just like a research assistantship or something like that. So, you know,

640
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:55,438
Trying to think about those things. It's also a good lesson for students too, because it does

641
00:38:55,698 --> 00:39:00,902
actually like if you are using free software, it does start to get into, well this is a way to

642
00:39:00,982 --> 00:39:06,907
think about how to manage your own studio because now you're like, where can I cut costs? I can cut

643
00:39:06,967 --> 00:39:14,673
costs by not having to pay the subscription for Maya or something like that. So it's like a little

644
00:39:14,693 --> 00:39:18,196
bit of studio management in there too. That's good.

645
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:20,571
Yeah, yeah. And I'm going to use that to segue in the next part,

646
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:23,093
because like, yeah, one of the resources that you can use at a

647
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:27,175
university are obviously students. And I think for me,

648
00:39:27,195 --> 00:39:30,037
because, well, with Brooklyn getting big, I, I had students

649
00:39:30,097 --> 00:39:33,879
involved as well, and to a lesser extent, I guess, then, you

650
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:38,482
know, it wasn't like a lab that was doing it. But I recruited

651
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:40,763
some students, like, hey, do you want to help out with some 3d

652
00:39:40,823 --> 00:39:43,785
models that I will not really have the time for making? And

653
00:39:44,442 --> 00:39:47,184
In the end, I asked them, OK, in exchange for your work,

654
00:39:47,224 --> 00:39:48,484
you want some compensation.

655
00:39:48,524 --> 00:39:50,305
Some of them wanted something, others didn't.

656
00:39:50,826 --> 00:39:53,027
In the end, Brooklyn wasn't a big money maker.

657
00:39:53,047 --> 00:39:54,007
It just broke even.

658
00:39:54,027 --> 00:39:55,668
But I was able to give every student what

659
00:39:55,708 --> 00:39:57,629
they wanted in exchange for their work.

660
00:39:57,649 --> 00:39:58,930
So I'm pretty proud about that.

661
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:03,132
But yeah, that brought some help, but also

662
00:40:03,152 --> 00:40:04,512
a lot of concerns as well.

663
00:40:04,532 --> 00:40:05,193
Because even though.

664
00:40:05,664 --> 00:40:07,886
you know, being able to show off Google to my students that

665
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:10,128
looked what I made, and they're like, Oh, my God, that's really

666
00:40:10,228 --> 00:40:13,351
awesome. And talking my teaching about and this is what happened

667
00:40:13,371 --> 00:40:15,793
when we did this and that in the project, or, you know, show the

668
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:18,555
project manager inside or the marketing side of Google to help

669
00:40:18,595 --> 00:40:22,578
my classes. It also brought some, some friction with it as

670
00:40:22,598 --> 00:40:25,881
well. For example, I had one student that was going to

671
00:40:25,921 --> 00:40:28,423
program everything, but it really didn't work out. And

672
00:40:28,483 --> 00:40:30,205
eventually, I have to just be like, look,

673
00:40:30,842 --> 00:40:31,802
this is not going to work.

674
00:40:31,902 --> 00:40:33,543
I'm just going to do this myself.

675
00:40:33,683 --> 00:40:36,645
And I'll give you credit for the work that you've done.

676
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:38,987
Although, I don't think anything actually made it to the game.

677
00:40:39,007 --> 00:40:41,668
But I'm like, if you want to use this in some kind of a way

678
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:43,129
to time that you invested it, I'll

679
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,550
do whatever I can to help you out.

680
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:47,452
It's still really stressful, because obviously you

681
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:48,272
don't want to do that.

682
00:40:48,332 --> 00:40:50,654
I mean, you bring a student in because you like their work,

683
00:40:50,734 --> 00:40:52,855
and you anticipate it's all going really well.

684
00:40:53,335 --> 00:40:55,797
But yeah, that was a thing that makes things a little bit

685
00:40:55,837 --> 00:40:56,777
harder for me as well.

686
00:40:56,837 --> 00:41:00,340
So for our next topic, I mean, I kind of already did it myself.

687
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:00,600
But like,

688
00:41:00,882 --> 00:41:03,343
teaching students. Any thoughts on that, guys?

689
00:41:04,363 --> 00:41:08,344
I think if I could jump in kind of talking about somewhat of what you you

690
00:41:08,384 --> 00:41:12,064
mentioned, Bob and Tracy had mentioned this a little bit earlier, too.

691
00:41:12,084 --> 00:41:18,086
I think, sure, the the the sad part about working at an institution trying to

692
00:41:18,126 --> 00:41:19,806
develop a game is it takes a long time.

693
00:41:20,326 --> 00:41:21,206
It takes a lot longer.

694
00:41:22,366 --> 00:41:26,027
But I think one of those benefits is this symbiotic kind of.

695
00:41:26,807 --> 00:41:33,350
incubation, at least for me, that I have where I can bring ideas that I'm working on into the

696
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:40,452
classroom when I'm teaching. That might be project management or that might be a new type of workflow

697
00:41:41,453 --> 00:41:45,654
and then I'm bringing that to test it and prove it and show to the students and teach them.

698
00:41:45,974 --> 00:41:50,116
but then I'm also learning stuff from their games if I'm overseeing a capstone project.

699
00:41:50,676 --> 00:41:56,860
So I think that's one really wonderful advantage of working within the confines of the institution

700
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:03,723
is that is a freeing thing of the institution. I think that larger commercial studios lack that

701
00:42:03,803 --> 00:42:09,306
ability to be so flexible and change over time. So that would be one thing I'd definitely say

702
00:42:09,346 --> 00:42:13,148
that I appreciate about kind of that teaching relationship with students.

703
00:42:13,994 --> 00:42:19,758
Yeah, one of the things that came up when we were building that diagram, I don't know if you have the diagram up right now.

704
00:42:19,778 --> 00:42:20,918
I do now.

705
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:39,330
All right. Well, I mean, you can see among all those bubbles, you know, we have like university program students kind of huddled into one area, but then we have that big arc of arrows going into the field, and then, you know, the rest of the arrows kind of weave their way back to the university program.

706
00:42:40,251 --> 00:42:41,451
That's one of the things that

707
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:51,727
I think doing this has really been a benefit in the classroom is that, you know, people think of

708
00:42:52,087 --> 00:42:57,249
like teaching as this other thing sometimes. And I don't, I don't agree with that at all. I think,

709
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:04,971
you know, all of this stuff feeds itself, where if I do something in my game development,

710
00:43:05,171 --> 00:43:09,352
I mean, you better believe I'm going to go talk about that in the classroom. And, and

711
00:43:10,438 --> 00:43:12,610
offer a perspective, whether it be in

712
00:43:13,121 --> 00:43:17,283
how I model my class to be like what it's like in the real world.

713
00:43:18,544 --> 00:43:22,446
Whether I take when I'm teaching animation theory, I mean, one of the best

714
00:43:22,546 --> 00:43:25,687
things was this past fall when I was making my PowerPoint.

715
00:43:25,707 --> 00:43:30,350
So I'm like, I have a bunch of gifs from hand-drawn animation for a little Nemo

716
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,371
in there of squash and stretch.

717
00:43:32,431 --> 00:43:35,472
OK, get Sprite of Flip put in PowerPoint.

718
00:43:36,353 --> 00:43:37,793
That was all that was really great.

719
00:43:37,873 --> 00:43:42,496
So you can see it like actual working models, not just me showing Looney Tunes.

720
00:43:43,176 --> 00:43:48,558
though I love Looney Tunes. But, you know, then you can really offer perspective on what it's like.

721
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:56,042
It's not theoretical anymore. It is real. And, you know, we get to make that come alive to the

722
00:43:56,082 --> 00:44:02,145
students in such a way that they see what it's like to really get into the industry instead of,

723
00:44:02,705 --> 00:44:03,565
again, sort of like a...

724
00:44:05,871 --> 00:44:09,152
fiction that they're fed about what it's like getting into the industry.

725
00:44:09,172 --> 00:44:12,833
So I think that's a really important point is that you can start to have real

726
00:44:13,353 --> 00:44:15,933
conversations about this as a job.

727
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:19,474
So just to build on that a little bit, Chris,

728
00:44:20,014 --> 00:44:24,615
also they can graduate with a shipped game. So, you know,

729
00:44:24,815 --> 00:44:28,116
this is invaluable to the students, right?

730
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:34,536
And so, you know, for me, it's, you know, you, what we do to solve the problem that,

731
00:44:34,656 --> 00:44:39,260
that Bob was talking about was maybe, you know, maybe are they a fit? Are they, do we have the

732
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,344
capabilities? Because a lot of times in the beginning year, we, we basically have all the

733
00:44:43,564 --> 00:44:48,789
research labs present what, what jobs they have open. And then people come and visit our working

734
00:44:48,809 --> 00:44:49,230
meetings.

735
00:44:49,944 --> 00:44:53,127
And they sort of gravitate towards what their expert,

736
00:44:53,267 --> 00:44:55,729
you know, what they can do and what the project needs.

737
00:44:55,849 --> 00:45:00,333
And often if there's not a fit, they'll just fall away.

738
00:45:00,493 --> 00:45:01,674
And it's sort of like this thing where

739
00:45:02,014 --> 00:45:05,897
we have a kind of trial period before we actually hire them.

740
00:45:06,197 --> 00:45:09,198
It's like an internship. It's like a in-school internship.

741
00:45:09,218 --> 00:45:14,180
They visit, they listen to us working, they say, I think I could do this. I say, why don't you give

742
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:20,081
it a try? Let's see if it works out, then we hire them. Right? It's a kind of a test in a way.

743
00:45:21,602 --> 00:45:29,444
We also have been very lucky in getting placements of graduate research. So the

744
00:45:29,564 --> 00:45:34,866
university has a graduate research program and a number of our students get

745
00:45:35,374 --> 00:45:40,816
research appointments, and then we can ask to have them placed in our labs.

746
00:45:41,496 --> 00:45:47,178
And with this kind of method, we get people who are being paid.

747
00:45:47,238 --> 00:45:50,079
They have a stipend. They get credits.

748
00:45:50,339 --> 00:45:54,280
It's actually a real appointment for them.

749
00:45:54,841 --> 00:45:58,342
And that's a level of commitment beyond just hourly student workers that I think

750
00:45:58,582 --> 00:46:03,023
has worked really well for us throughout the process.

751
00:46:04,291 --> 00:46:16,676
I think, and to go back a little bit to, you know, you were bringing up the structure of like, sort of the early work like tryout period, right?

752
00:46:17,683 --> 00:46:41,691
I think that's one of the things that I've learned through working with students on projects like this in our internship course is the ways in which you do have to bend your process a little bit, you know, if, if I'm working with a animator, who's been in the industry like five years or something like that I can be like, all right, go make a run cycle, and they'll go make a run cycle.

753
00:46:42,951 --> 00:46:43,911
But working with.

754
00:46:44,987 --> 00:46:48,972
the students, it's almost like, you know, you really have to bring them in and, and, you know,

755
00:46:48,992 --> 00:46:54,679
their entry level to junior, and you have to, you know, I can't just say, go make a run cycle,

756
00:46:55,060 --> 00:47:00,767
or if I do, I might have to redo that run cycle later. But, you know, we've started to.

757
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:06,435
we've gotten better about doing things like, and I'm speaking mainly as an animator right now,

758
00:47:07,336 --> 00:47:13,682
or artist animator, I could do something like I do all the keyframes of the animation and

759
00:47:13,702 --> 00:47:17,727
then I hand that document, the keyframes off to the junior artist.

760
00:47:18,327 --> 00:47:20,648
And then I say, all right, can you do the in-betweens?

761
00:47:20,769 --> 00:47:23,950
And a model like that, it's a little more work for me.

762
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:27,052
But the student has that baseline

763
00:47:27,532 --> 00:47:32,094
so that everything comes back way more coherent, where,

764
00:47:32,735 --> 00:47:36,217
you know, so you do have to change your process

765
00:47:36,237 --> 00:47:36,677
a little bit.

766
00:47:36,857 --> 00:47:38,518
But it does.

767
00:47:38,658 --> 00:47:39,478
Or your design.

768
00:47:39,979 --> 00:47:42,200
Just to kind of, one of the things that we found

769
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:45,001
is sometimes you find students with special talents.

770
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:46,902
And we have put.

771
00:47:47,212 --> 00:47:50,435
features in based on those special talents, right?

772
00:47:51,856 --> 00:47:53,717
Like one of our students was really great

773
00:47:53,777 --> 00:47:56,079
at animating hands, which we hadn't had.

774
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:59,642
And so in the original design, there were no animated hands.

775
00:48:00,142 --> 00:48:03,345
And so we had the student, he was a graduate researcher.

776
00:48:03,645 --> 00:48:05,486
He's like, let me try this, right?

777
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:07,848
And so he did it and we're like, oh my God,

778
00:48:07,888 --> 00:48:09,710
let's add this to the game.

779
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:13,293
That's awesome too, because their hands are not easy.

780
00:48:13,433 --> 00:48:14,093
Hands!

781
00:48:14,494 --> 00:48:15,574
You're good at it.

782
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:21,430
So teaching is obviously a really big part

783
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:23,772
of the professor game designer.

784
00:48:24,492 --> 00:48:26,753
But the other part is, how are you going to be evaluated

785
00:48:26,793 --> 00:48:28,014
by your university?

786
00:48:28,134 --> 00:48:32,176
Now, I realize that we're taking a lot of time

787
00:48:32,196 --> 00:48:33,397
to discuss all these topics, and we

788
00:48:33,417 --> 00:48:35,318
need to make sure that we wrap it up in the time slot.

789
00:48:35,738 --> 00:48:36,959
So I'm going to go a little bit off script,

790
00:48:36,979 --> 00:48:39,640
because our last two topics are dissemination and validation.

791
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,861
But I feel like those are two topics that are close together

792
00:48:41,901 --> 00:48:43,782
so that we can address them a little bit faster.

793
00:48:44,362 --> 00:48:44,523
So.

794
00:48:45,363 --> 00:48:46,104
What do you guys think?

795
00:48:46,124 --> 00:48:47,625
How do you disseminate your games?

796
00:48:47,665 --> 00:48:49,526
How do you make sure if university respects

797
00:48:49,566 --> 00:48:51,647
what you're doing and values it for tenure

798
00:48:51,727 --> 00:48:53,829
and for all sorts of performance reviews?

799
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:58,712
So as the pre-tenure person on the panel,

800
00:48:59,212 --> 00:49:00,913
I'm gonna start off here.

801
00:49:02,274 --> 00:49:05,396
I'm actually in somewhat uncharted territory for my unit.

802
00:49:06,937 --> 00:49:08,177
So I'm kind of the guinea pig.

803
00:49:08,858 --> 00:49:11,339
You know, our program was just accredited last year.

804
00:49:11,419 --> 00:49:12,040
So we are,

805
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:15,102
and there has not been a tenured.

806
00:49:15,528 --> 00:49:26,614
person in my field yet. So a lot of this has had to do with contextualizing these works properly

807
00:49:27,854 --> 00:49:34,617
in a way that people can understand, like, from other fields, what these are. Because the school

808
00:49:34,677 --> 00:49:39,840
in a high level is in support of this kind of work. But, you know, and I'm actually working

809
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:44,222
on my tenure documentation right now. You know, my

810
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:51,993
yearly check in thing. So I have to do a lot of extra work in my

811
00:49:52,053 --> 00:49:55,794
narrative, for example, to describe like what it means to

812
00:49:55,834 --> 00:50:00,156
publish a game. If I publish something quick, you know that

813
00:50:00,576 --> 00:50:04,257
try to contextualize that, you know, kind of build it out to be

814
00:50:04,277 --> 00:50:06,978
like, well, that something quick and small, like a game jam game

815
00:50:07,018 --> 00:50:10,000
might be the equivalent of doing, you know, maybe a

816
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:14,521
smaller paper. Whereas, you know, if I spend two years on a

817
00:50:14,581 --> 00:50:14,881
game,

818
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:19,403
like La Mancha or like Nemo is, you know, gonna become,

819
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:23,845
you know, try to contextualize that in steps of like,

820
00:50:23,865 --> 00:50:25,346
well, this is like prepping a book.

821
00:50:26,206 --> 00:50:30,988
So you have to do a lot of explanation and working with,

822
00:50:32,949 --> 00:50:34,669
you know, if you have like a faculty mentor,

823
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:35,190
that's the best.

824
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:37,491
We have a great mentoring program in our program.

825
00:50:37,591 --> 00:50:40,612
So, you know, that's really helpful,

826
00:50:40,972 --> 00:50:43,833
but learning how to, I guess,

827
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:48,242
describe these things is one of the biggest things that I have to do.

828
00:50:49,063 --> 00:50:54,848
I think what you said about mentorship is really good. I'm glad you brought that up, Chris, because

829
00:50:55,268 --> 00:50:59,372
especially for those that are on the tenure track or perhaps just getting into it,

830
00:50:59,792 --> 00:51:06,958
academic instructor, adjunct, finding others that have helped blaze that trail is going to be very,

831
00:51:06,998 --> 00:51:11,402
very helpful to have them as allies. And I would say too, just as a kind of a...

832
00:51:12,623 --> 00:51:20,146
somewhat of a tangent. I'm in the School of Art and Design, and so when I created Tombow,

833
00:51:20,166 --> 00:51:25,789
I was already tenured. But what I did was, yes, I put it up online. I did the things that many

834
00:51:26,189 --> 00:51:31,611
game designers and developers might do. But I also, because I was in my art and design department,

835
00:51:31,952 --> 00:51:32,972
I had an art exhibition.

836
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:36,334
I thought that it would be a great way to demonstrate

837
00:51:36,654 --> 00:51:41,317
to my peers that this should be held as a work of art.

838
00:51:41,357 --> 00:51:43,699
So I had the game, but then I had process.

839
00:51:43,799 --> 00:51:46,120
I had this, people were calling it my Pinterest wall,

840
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:50,483
but it was basically about 500 images, sketches, images,

841
00:51:50,963 --> 00:51:51,984
that I put up on the wall.

842
00:51:52,604 --> 00:51:54,946
I 3D printed a number of my objects

843
00:51:55,026 --> 00:51:55,986
modeled from the game too.

844
00:51:56,407 --> 00:51:58,868
So kind of trying to create this overall process

845
00:51:58,888 --> 00:52:00,709
to help others that obviously we know it.

846
00:52:00,789 --> 00:52:01,890
We're surrounded by people that don't,

847
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:04,131
frankly understand what we do and how we do it,

848
00:52:04,571 --> 00:52:06,971
but it's a nice way to bring that to a level

849
00:52:07,011 --> 00:52:08,052
that they might understand.

850
00:52:08,452 --> 00:52:10,372
And I found that to be quite successful,

851
00:52:10,432 --> 00:52:12,073
even though it seemed like it was extraneous

852
00:52:12,113 --> 00:52:13,233
and I didn't, I thought,

853
00:52:13,493 --> 00:52:14,433
I don't know if I should do this.

854
00:52:14,913 --> 00:52:16,274
I was very happy I did at the end

855
00:52:16,334 --> 00:52:19,254
because my colleagues who would have been tenuring me

856
00:52:19,294 --> 00:52:21,495
if I was on the tenure track at that point

857
00:52:21,835 --> 00:52:24,236
would have fully understood what I was doing as well.

858
00:52:25,136 --> 00:52:25,416
Yeah.

859
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:25,556
Oh.

860
00:52:29,198 --> 00:52:37,140
Okay, real quick. On the point of seeming extraneous, though, that is actually another

861
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:41,601
way that you can play the game with this. Totally, yeah.

862
00:52:42,521 --> 00:52:48,262
Is that, you know, okay, so I made a game. Now I can publish papers about what I learned from

863
00:52:48,902 --> 00:52:55,883
publishing that game. How the game, you know, again, based on 400 plus year old piece of

864
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:56,383
literature.

865
00:52:57,464 --> 00:53:02,490
expresses the piece of literature and the themes within and things like that, you know, you start

866
00:53:02,531 --> 00:53:09,679
to treat this as a piece of literary criticism beyond just being cool game product. So I think

867
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:12,763
that is also a thing you learn how to do is.

868
00:53:13,919 --> 00:53:19,783
turn this untraditional publication into traditional publications. And you can probably

869
00:53:19,803 --> 00:53:26,509
get like a few years of traditional publications out of something like this. So that's another,

870
00:53:26,989 --> 00:53:33,675
again, it goes back all into that loop of make thing, have it feed your other

871
00:53:34,316 --> 00:53:38,419
traditional types of validation. Yeah, yeah, I would agree.

872
00:53:38,459 --> 00:53:43,023
Sorry. Yeah, I think for me, the same thing applied there like.

873
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:47,082
I learned at the university, as long as I can show that people care about it in some

874
00:53:47,122 --> 00:53:52,705
way, whether it's through publications getting accepted or through rewards or awards or all

875
00:53:52,745 --> 00:53:54,686
that kind of stuff, that helps tremendously.

876
00:53:54,706 --> 00:53:59,028
Or even the amount of downloads that you generate, publishing that in your 10-year dose, it helps

877
00:53:59,068 --> 00:53:59,348
a lot.

878
00:54:00,529 --> 00:54:03,851
So, you know, I can resonate a lot with those things.

879
00:54:04,371 --> 00:54:06,472
I think the thing that I want to add, though, is like...

880
00:54:07,128 --> 00:54:11,310
I would love to see a category for professor made games that like festivals and everything.

881
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:15,251
Because a lot of the times we, you know, with Brooklyn, I had to go up against big

882
00:54:15,411 --> 00:54:19,613
companies and like, it's still that, well, it's great, but I feel like I'm always just,

883
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:25,695
you know, playing in a competition in which I'm completely, um, yeah, overwhelmed or,

884
00:54:25,735 --> 00:54:26,956
yeah, I'm not at the same skill level.

885
00:54:27,016 --> 00:54:29,156
I put it, that's such a funny point, Bob.

886
00:54:29,256 --> 00:54:32,718
I, you know, I want to tell you just a little funny story really early on.

887
00:54:33,826 --> 00:54:43,032
I had submitted the night journey to the IGF and they actually called me and they're like,

888
00:54:43,292 --> 00:54:46,895
oh, you know, we really want to honor this, blah, blah, blah. Would you mind if we put it

889
00:54:46,915 --> 00:54:55,460
in the student category? And I was like, do you know who Bill Viola is? I was like, I don't think

890
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,401
that's appropriate at all, right?

891
00:54:58,794 --> 00:55:08,361
And you know, I think what you're saying, Bob, is really interesting because, you know, we're not indies, we're not commercial, and we're not students, right?

892
00:55:08,882 --> 00:55:21,692
And we live in this wild land between, you know, academia and indie development, essentially, that, you know, it's a wonder we get anything made at all, right?

893
00:55:22,353 --> 00:55:26,036
I just want to go back to the question of tenure and validation for just one second.

894
00:55:26,116 --> 00:55:27,236
So when I went up for tenure.

895
00:55:28,225 --> 00:55:30,765
There were no places to exhibit your work, right?

896
00:55:30,885 --> 00:55:32,566
I mean, when I worked on For Tenure,

897
00:55:32,926 --> 00:55:38,407
it was like the year before IndieCade did its first awards.

898
00:55:38,707 --> 00:55:39,087
Okay.

899
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:44,268
So one of the things that we had to do was think about,

900
00:55:44,288 --> 00:55:45,448
okay, what about the grants?

901
00:55:45,788 --> 00:55:47,749
So we had that NEA grant, right?

902
00:55:48,229 --> 00:55:49,729
And that's always been in my mind

903
00:55:49,809 --> 00:55:51,970
that I began to understand how,

904
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:54,770
when you get validation in the form of a grant,

905
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:58,122
that that also helps your tenure story.

906
00:55:58,542 --> 00:55:59,603
All the things you guys were saying.

907
00:55:59,623 --> 00:56:01,045
So Dave, I really resonate

908
00:56:01,065 --> 00:56:04,328
with what you were saying about exhibits.

909
00:56:04,908 --> 00:56:08,411
So I've done a lot of focus on getting the works exhibited

910
00:56:09,192 --> 00:56:11,194
because that tends to hold more weight

911
00:56:11,334 --> 00:56:12,755
than commercial sales.

912
00:56:13,796 --> 00:56:16,278
Though commercial sales are, you know, nice.

913
00:56:16,318 --> 00:56:17,179
They're nice to put in there,

914
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:20,362
but exhibits in important venues and

915
00:56:21,758 --> 00:56:25,682
Awards are often really, you know,

916
00:56:25,722 --> 00:56:26,763
whether they're supposed to be or not,

917
00:56:26,803 --> 00:56:29,245
they are important when people evaluate

918
00:56:29,325 --> 00:56:31,106
your tenure case, right?

919
00:56:31,167 --> 00:56:35,070
And grants, the people who voted with their money,

920
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:37,692
essentially, to support the work that you're doing,

921
00:56:38,573 --> 00:56:39,594
really, really important.

922
00:56:39,614 --> 00:56:40,995
Yeah.

923
00:56:41,396 --> 00:56:46,300
And, you know, you mentioned Professor Gaines.

924
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:48,631
in particular, Bob.

925
00:56:48,751 --> 00:56:50,251
And one of the things that I think

926
00:56:50,691 --> 00:56:55,572
is really interesting about this is that, first of all, I agree.

927
00:56:56,052 --> 00:56:58,733
And I also agree with the addition

928
00:56:58,813 --> 00:57:00,273
that we talked about this before,

929
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:02,833
where the traditional forms of validation

930
00:57:02,933 --> 00:57:06,854
seem to be for games for x, games for y.

931
00:57:08,615 --> 00:57:12,035
Like Tracy said, we are in this weird in-between position

932
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,596
where we are kind of doing commercial stuff.

933
00:57:14,636 --> 00:57:16,056
So it's not totally for x or y.

934
00:57:16,826 --> 00:57:23,092
Um, but, you know, maybe like my, my board game, La Mancha had some educational

935
00:57:23,272 --> 00:57:25,394
aspects to it because it was based on literature.

936
00:57:25,414 --> 00:57:29,718
Um, I wouldn't call little Nemo informative, but I would also

937
00:57:29,778 --> 00:57:31,320
call it a commercial video game.

938
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:36,725
Um, so I think what's interesting to me about these though, and what I think makes

939
00:57:36,785 --> 00:57:37,366
them great.

940
00:57:38,362 --> 00:57:46,185
works that can be academically validated is that we have to be a little more thoughtful

941
00:57:46,405 --> 00:57:51,988
in our game development. We can't just make like cool video game. We've got to make cool video game

942
00:57:52,008 --> 00:57:57,390
but it's got to have this other element whether it be we are thinking analytically about the design

943
00:57:57,430 --> 00:58:05,033
or using a process in a new way or it does have some connection to education or something like

944
00:58:05,073 --> 00:58:05,213
that.

945
00:58:07,138 --> 00:58:09,679
where we're interpreting a classic work or something.

946
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:11,440
So, you know-

947
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:14,461
I call it what Dave described is,

948
00:58:15,101 --> 00:58:16,602
we call it design research.

949
00:58:17,082 --> 00:58:18,043
Yes. Yeah, yeah.

950
00:58:18,563 --> 00:58:21,244
And we frame it that way when we discuss it.

951
00:58:21,304 --> 00:58:23,085
We say creative research, yeah, yeah.

952
00:58:23,825 --> 00:58:27,047
But yeah, I mean, this is what architects do.

953
00:58:27,227 --> 00:58:29,508
This is what graphic designers do.

954
00:58:29,988 --> 00:58:30,128
So,

955
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:38,964
So I think it has both that academic element, but then what's great about this is that it also becomes commercial curiosity.

956
00:58:39,884 --> 00:58:52,351
We have like these games have that like commercial that some some novelty that gives them a little bit of an edge in the marketplace because they're interesting because frankly, we have to feed the academic part.

957
00:58:52,791 --> 00:58:55,032
And then it also ends up feeding the commercial part.

958
00:58:55,392 --> 00:58:56,292
So I think that's worth.

959
00:58:57,530 --> 00:59:01,232
pointing out and also like talking about in how these games

960
00:59:01,912 --> 00:59:05,313
are distinct and why they should be a you know different category.

961
00:59:06,253 --> 00:59:09,434
Yeah well I think we're running out of time here so

962
00:59:10,054 --> 00:59:12,355
to wrap things up because we just discussed the six topics

963
00:59:13,075 --> 00:59:16,296
I'm gonna ask for each and every one of you and maybe like in one sentence

964
00:59:16,797 --> 00:59:20,438
if there is one piece of advice you could give to whoever is watching right now

965
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:22,578
what would that piece of advice be?

966
00:59:25,168 --> 00:59:27,329
I'll go first, and I said it already once,

967
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:31,391
but don't be afraid to ask others for help.

968
00:59:32,112 --> 00:59:33,612
Bring other people to your team.

969
00:59:33,953 --> 00:59:36,334
It's a long process, it's a hard process.

970
00:59:36,714 --> 00:59:38,155
You're not an expert of everything,

971
00:59:38,295 --> 00:59:39,915
even though you might want to think you are,

972
00:59:39,955 --> 00:59:41,136
need to feel you need to prove it.

973
00:59:42,497 --> 00:59:43,057
Ask for help.

974
00:59:43,137 --> 00:59:44,938
It's gonna be the best decision you'll make

975
00:59:45,018 --> 00:59:46,318
towards a future project.

976
00:59:47,821 --> 00:59:50,483
I would say choose your idea carefully.

977
00:59:50,644 --> 00:59:53,286
Don't just do the cool game you think you want to do.

978
00:59:53,626 --> 00:59:56,028
Choose an idea that has some depth

979
00:59:56,689 --> 01:00:03,114
that can really be used for this academic rigor,

980
01:00:03,174 --> 01:00:06,097
this design research that has potential for funding,

981
01:00:06,477 --> 01:00:08,499
that has the potential for this commercial curiosity.

982
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:11,161
Choose your idea very, very carefully.

983
01:00:13,148 --> 01:00:24,013
I would say as an instructor, you're in an important position of power, even if you know, like pre tenure people don't often feel like they have a lot of power, but you know you are you are.

984
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:26,651
valuable member of your community

985
01:00:26,731 --> 01:00:28,673
and valuable to your students.

986
01:00:29,214 --> 01:00:30,615
And I would say, you know,

987
01:00:31,096 --> 01:00:34,199
these types of projects will bring a community together.

988
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,882
You know, use them as a way, you know,

989
01:00:37,902 --> 01:00:40,905
we talked a lot about students getting shipped products,

990
01:00:41,366 --> 01:00:44,549
try to use opportunities like this that you're having

991
01:00:44,649 --> 01:00:47,212
to also, you know, help your students,

992
01:00:47,252 --> 01:00:50,255
help other people along, try to climb that hill together.

993
01:00:50,888 --> 01:00:57,253
um you know team up and and accomplish amazing things and you know use this to the benefit of

994
01:00:57,853 --> 01:01:03,077
the education you're providing. Right and mine would be to build up your community around your

995
01:01:03,097 --> 01:01:08,281
game from day one including the students but also the community around your game because you're

996
01:01:08,341 --> 01:01:12,625
going to need that community for your game to be validated and to get all the good things that you

997
01:01:12,645 --> 01:01:17,388
can have from making a commercial game as a professor. So anyways with that we've come to

998
01:01:17,408 --> 01:01:18,209
the end of our session.

999
01:01:18,984 --> 01:01:20,524
Again, these are only four viewpoints,

1000
01:01:20,564 --> 01:01:22,444
but we hope they were very useful to you.

1001
01:01:22,544 --> 01:01:25,145
And I'm really hoping that we're gonna see more sessions

1002
01:01:25,205 --> 01:01:26,065
like this in the future.

1003
01:01:26,205 --> 01:01:27,966
After all, in the end,

1004
01:01:27,986 --> 01:01:30,346
this is all about helping as many game professors

1005
01:01:30,426 --> 01:01:32,307
as possible to be active developers,

1006
01:01:32,907 --> 01:01:35,947
as doing so plays a key part in facilitating

1007
01:01:35,987 --> 01:01:37,908
those three big arrows in that diagram,

1008
01:01:38,768 --> 01:01:41,329
where the academic gaming landscape improves the field

1009
01:01:41,349 --> 01:01:43,929
with high quality scholarship and capable students.

1010
01:01:44,509 --> 01:01:46,590
And with that, I'd like to thank you all for watching

1011
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:48,010
and enjoy the rest of your GDC.

1012
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:48,550
Bye-bye.

1013
01:01:49,143 --> 01:01:49,584
Bye-bye!
