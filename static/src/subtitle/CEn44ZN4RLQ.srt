1
00:00:04,905 --> 00:00:12,929
Hey everybody, if you could turn off your cell phones

2
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:14,630
and make sure to fill out the forms afterwards,

3
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:19,292
that'd be great.

4
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:22,614
Everybody loving that ordering on the word order?

5
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:23,674
Does it bother anybody?

6
00:00:23,674 --> 00:00:25,655
Yeah, that's kind of awful.

7
00:00:26,107 --> 00:00:26,687
Right, cool.

8
00:00:26,687 --> 00:00:29,589
All right, so my name's Nathan Fouts.

9
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:30,709
I'm from Mommy's Best Games,

10
00:00:30,709 --> 00:00:36,333
and we're going to set this game in order.

11
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:39,875
So we're gonna look at ways to organize levels

12
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:40,896
and lots of mechanics,

13
00:00:40,896 --> 00:00:42,797
and what can happen when you have a game

14
00:00:42,797 --> 00:00:45,338
that's got a lot of stuff to keep track of,

15
00:00:45,338 --> 00:00:47,840
and what you should be doing to manage all that.

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,201
But before we get into that,

17
00:00:49,728 --> 00:00:53,530
We're gonna talk about some basics of difficulty curves,

18
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,610
level design mindsets and ways to think about level design,

19
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,451
and some examples of games with lots of mechanics,

20
00:00:59,451 --> 00:01:00,972
and then some possible solutions.

21
00:01:00,972 --> 00:01:05,693
So back in 2007, after working in AAA for a few years there,

22
00:01:05,693 --> 00:01:07,974
I ended up going independent with Mommy's Best Games,

23
00:01:07,974 --> 00:01:10,355
and we made a lot of shoot-'em-ups over the years there.

24
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:14,624
And we made Shoot 1 Up and that got us recognized

25
00:01:14,624 --> 00:01:18,006
by Devolver Digital and we got to make a Serious Sam game

26
00:01:18,006 --> 00:01:19,968
for them in 2D called Serious Sam Double D XXL.

27
00:01:19,968 --> 00:01:22,470
And I created the idea of the gun stacker.

28
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,612
You do the same, gets to stack his guns

29
00:01:25,612 --> 00:01:27,634
one on top of the other to shoot the bad guys.

30
00:01:27,634 --> 00:01:30,496
That game had 40 weapons and over 20 levels

31
00:01:30,496 --> 00:01:33,919
and it was already starting to get to be a big mess.

32
00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:35,220
I love to use this promotional art,

33
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,021
I never get to use it, so it's silly.

34
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:39,223
There's a teacup stacker, I don't know.

35
00:01:39,223 --> 00:01:39,263
So.

36
00:01:41,302 --> 00:01:46,147
In 2013, I began working on what would be our biggest game yet called Pig Eat Ball.

37
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:49,691
It is a classically styled kind of arcade adventure game.

38
00:01:49,691 --> 00:01:52,995
It has hundreds of levels, lots of bosses, a story.

39
00:01:52,995 --> 00:01:56,319
It's non-procedural, all handmade.

40
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,542
And it had a whole bunch of stuff to keep track of.

41
00:01:58,542 --> 00:02:00,243
And it's like 6 to 10 hours long.

42
00:02:00,243 --> 00:02:01,965
So there's a lot of stuff going on.

43
00:02:02,905 --> 00:02:06,408
So I was trying to figure out how are we going to keep track of all the mechanics,

44
00:02:06,408 --> 00:02:13,574
how do I know what everything is in the game, how am I going to balance my difficulty curve there.

45
00:02:13,574 --> 00:02:17,297
So in any game, this is a 2D game but it still applies to bigger 3D games,

46
00:02:17,297 --> 00:02:21,600
how do you keep track of if someone changes a mechanic in the game,

47
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,624
changes one of the enemy types, if they add a new one and you want to insert it into the middle of your game.

48
00:02:27,245 --> 00:02:29,246
you shouldn't be testing a 10 hour game

49
00:02:29,246 --> 00:02:30,827
every time something changes, right?

50
00:02:30,827 --> 00:02:33,309
So you should know where those enemies show up in the game.

51
00:02:33,309 --> 00:02:36,111
So that's the kind of problems I wanted to get into

52
00:02:36,111 --> 00:02:39,214
and I talked to other designers about solutions

53
00:02:39,214 --> 00:02:40,174
over their years.

54
00:02:40,174 --> 00:02:41,916
So before we get into all that,

55
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:46,439
we're gonna talk about some level design mindsets

56
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:47,560
and difficulty curves.

57
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,002
So if you wanted to plot out your difficulty curve,

58
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:51,543
you'd probably start with something where

59
00:02:51,543 --> 00:02:54,165
the game gets harder when the player gets

60
00:02:54,165 --> 00:02:54,965
further into the game.

61
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:57,700
and get a nice upward slope like that.

62
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,681
And if you're a masochist, maybe you're gonna make a game

63
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:02,142
get immediately hard and then stay just super hard

64
00:03:02,142 --> 00:03:05,983
the whole time, like Super Meat Boy or something like that.

65
00:03:05,983 --> 00:03:09,505
I like this idea of, I call it the heartbeat curve.

66
00:03:09,505 --> 00:03:12,226
So it's a gentle slope, but it has periodic spikes

67
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:13,887
and dips in it.

68
00:03:13,887 --> 00:03:15,187
We'll zoom in here on that.

69
00:03:16,788 --> 00:03:22,553
And the idea is you start out with and introduce a mechanic and it's a super easy to play level.

70
00:03:22,553 --> 00:03:25,515
The player can't really fail, they just get used to the idea.

71
00:03:25,515 --> 00:03:29,438
Then you start to twist the mechanic and add little changes to it and slightly challenge

72
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:31,600
the player further along in the levels.

73
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:34,310
And then finally, there's a big spike in the difficulty.

74
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,711
It's not terrible, but it's there.

75
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:38,672
And the player gets a rush, and then they accomplish,

76
00:03:38,672 --> 00:03:40,372
and they beat the mid-boss or the boss,

77
00:03:40,372 --> 00:03:42,193
and it's a big spike there, and it feels good.

78
00:03:42,193 --> 00:03:44,994
And then you start over, but it dips way down.

79
00:03:44,994 --> 00:03:46,515
So the difference is really sharp,

80
00:03:46,515 --> 00:03:49,436
and the player gets a big, full relief feeling,

81
00:03:49,436 --> 00:03:51,877
and they feel like they really accomplished something cool.

82
00:03:51,877 --> 00:03:53,057
And then you introduce a new mechanic,

83
00:03:53,057 --> 00:03:55,518
and the whole process starts over there.

84
00:03:57,368 --> 00:04:02,110
So that's my heartbeat curve. There's also a really good talk on the GDC Vault for free

85
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:07,452
about the game called Jelly Splash. They have a whole different take on the difficulty curve.

86
00:04:07,452 --> 00:04:12,215
It's a mobile game. It's really popular. It's probably designed to teach you how to

87
00:04:12,215 --> 00:04:16,317
just vacuum cash out of players' wallets. You should go look at it. It's really smart.

88
00:04:17,477 --> 00:04:19,198
So when you're thinking about difficulty curves,

89
00:04:19,198 --> 00:04:21,679
there's the concepts of puzzle difficulty

90
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:22,960
and skill difficulty.

91
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,463
So puzzle difficulty is the idea of how hard is it

92
00:04:26,463 --> 00:04:28,184
for a player to figure out what to do,

93
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,586
and the skill difficulty is how hard is it

94
00:04:30,586 --> 00:04:32,507
for them to execute it with their hands in the controls.

95
00:04:32,507 --> 00:04:35,349
You could actually probably plot both these two

96
00:04:35,349 --> 00:04:37,330
on two different types of difficulty curves for your game.

97
00:04:39,192 --> 00:04:42,252
So now we're gonna shift into design mindsets.

98
00:04:42,252 --> 00:04:43,933
Just some overviews of different ways

99
00:04:43,933 --> 00:04:45,553
to think about level design.

100
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:48,154
So that's Bioshock there, of course,

101
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:52,315
and this is an idea of environmental storytelling.

102
00:04:52,315 --> 00:04:54,595
It's kind of the idea of the player asking,

103
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:55,996
what happened here?

104
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:58,136
And then thinking of what happened there,

105
00:04:58,136 --> 00:05:00,737
and there's a really good talk on the vault

106
00:05:00,737 --> 00:05:02,177
called What Happened Here?

107
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,358
It's from 2010, you should check it out, it's excellent.

108
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:09,284
Another cool game that's really big with environmental storytelling was Hyper Light Drifter.

109
00:05:09,284 --> 00:05:14,891
It's just the idea of the player looking and them telling the story without being explicitly told what the story is.

110
00:05:16,242 --> 00:05:22,604
So kind of related to that, I like to think is set piece design with the Call of Duty series and others.

111
00:05:22,604 --> 00:05:28,066
You kind of take like a basic gameplay, simple shooting guys and maybe not a lot of enemy types,

112
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:32,088
but you really dress it up with these huge environmental set pieces.

113
00:05:32,088 --> 00:05:36,130
The Golden Gate Bridge and America Explodes, that kind of thing.

114
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:41,172
And it really adds a lot of flavor to what would be kind of normal kind of gameplay.

115
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,931
So another type is what I like to call transcendent level design.

116
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:52,672
I really like shoot-em-ups and bullet hells, there's like these curtains of bullets and

117
00:05:52,672 --> 00:05:55,393
I talked to a player, he had a really good quote, he said, bullet hells are like that

118
00:05:55,393 --> 00:05:58,714
moment when apparent chaos becomes perfect order in your mind.

119
00:05:58,714 --> 00:06:03,095
It's just a different way of thinking and related to that is racing games.

120
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:05,955
You can even like Rez or Thumper or the Wipeout series.

121
00:06:06,555 --> 00:06:09,538
And one of the games in the Wipeout series, Wipeout Fusion,

122
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:11,479
even had a mode called the Zone Mode,

123
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:13,641
where you have to loop the levels as long as you can,

124
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:14,942
getting faster and faster.

125
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:18,705
It's just a different way of kind of building your levels.

126
00:06:18,705 --> 00:06:21,407
And the final design type is mechanics-driven or modular,

127
00:06:21,407 --> 00:06:22,828
which is the one I'm gonna focus on today.

128
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:25,219
So that's Super Mario Galaxy there.

129
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:25,940
I mean, look at that.

130
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,681
There's just like so much going on, right?

131
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:28,761
You can interact with all of it.

132
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:31,283
There's the lily pad, the water,

133
00:06:31,283 --> 00:06:33,164
the Bumblebee power-up, the 1-Up.

134
00:06:33,164 --> 00:06:35,045
You're probably thinking about hopping on that flower

135
00:06:35,045 --> 00:06:36,685
in the background, the purple thing, right?

136
00:06:36,685 --> 00:06:38,126
It's all really cool stuff.

137
00:06:38,126 --> 00:06:39,987
And there's a lot of games like that.

138
00:06:39,987 --> 00:06:41,888
Super Monkey Ball has some cool,

139
00:06:41,888 --> 00:06:44,149
a whole bunch of puzzles like that.

140
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:46,691
The Rayman series, the new stuff.

141
00:06:46,691 --> 00:06:49,112
There's like those little fireflies to grab,

142
00:06:49,112 --> 00:06:50,313
the lily pads to hop on.

143
00:06:50,313 --> 00:06:52,594
Everything's interactable and it's really interesting.

144
00:06:54,258 --> 00:06:56,799
So on my own game there, this is our upcoming game,

145
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:59,881
Piggy Ball, if you look there's bowling pins,

146
00:06:59,881 --> 00:07:02,582
conveyor belts, cue sticks, there's a lot of stuff

147
00:07:02,582 --> 00:07:04,603
going on, it looks really busy, but the player

148
00:07:04,603 --> 00:07:07,505
gets introduced to these slowly, and this sort of game

149
00:07:07,505 --> 00:07:10,966
just lends itself to lots of levels and lots of mechanics.

150
00:07:10,966 --> 00:07:14,648
Because you want to introduce all these mechanics nicely.

151
00:07:14,648 --> 00:07:16,629
Here's Marble Saga Kororinpa.

152
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:19,050
I mean look, there's scissors in the background,

153
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,991
they get a level, right, there's that diamond,

154
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:22,452
there's pinball bumpers.

155
00:07:23,872 --> 00:07:26,836
Here's Ape Escape 2, there's that cool silver slope

156
00:07:26,836 --> 00:07:30,182
your eye's drawn to, then there's little gold pickups,

157
00:07:30,182 --> 00:07:32,546
crates, the apes, they all get their levels

158
00:07:32,546 --> 00:07:34,669
and they all get slowly introduced in these huge games.

159
00:07:37,475 --> 00:07:39,636
So I'm talking about introductions and not tutorials.

160
00:07:39,636 --> 00:07:41,357
Tutorials sound awful, right?

161
00:07:41,357 --> 00:07:42,978
You put that at the beginning of the game

162
00:07:42,978 --> 00:07:44,059
and everybody hates it.

163
00:07:44,059 --> 00:07:46,000
Hopefully you guys don't even have to do that.

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,381
You should be able to introduce mechanics slowly

165
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:50,122
and flesh out the mechanic

166
00:07:50,122 --> 00:07:51,963
and give it its own nice little area

167
00:07:51,963 --> 00:07:54,345
in the bigger level or its own little level.

168
00:07:54,345 --> 00:07:55,986
This is Super Mario Galaxy 2.

169
00:07:55,986 --> 00:07:57,927
This is the Flezzard level.

170
00:07:59,109 --> 00:08:05,615
It's actually, it's far into the game. It's World 2, Area 2. It's a whole little mini-game of tilting the controller.

171
00:08:05,615 --> 00:08:10,099
It just makes the game feel so much more polished if you give your mechanics some room to breathe

172
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:13,121
between all the other stuff you've got going on. Just do a nice introduction.

173
00:08:13,121 --> 00:08:16,684
Ape Escape 2 is another favorite of mine.

174
00:08:16,684 --> 00:08:18,426
Here's the super hoop mechanic.

175
00:08:19,403 --> 00:08:22,825
So you spin the right thumb stick really fast,

176
00:08:22,825 --> 00:08:26,767
and you can actually run up those sharp slopes.

177
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:28,988
So that silver slope on the other screenshot,

178
00:08:28,988 --> 00:08:30,629
this whole level is the level

179
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:32,790
they introduced the super hoop mechanic in.

180
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,551
It's all this Spanish tile.

181
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:37,252
And so now it's a nice area to play in,

182
00:08:37,252 --> 00:08:40,013
the whole level's built around it,

183
00:08:40,013 --> 00:08:41,554
but from then, that point on,

184
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:44,756
anytime you see those slopes, you know what to do.

185
00:08:44,756 --> 00:08:46,557
You're like, okay, great, I got this super hoop mechanic,

186
00:08:46,557 --> 00:08:47,157
I'm gonna use it.

187
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:50,703
Which brings me back around to our own game,

188
00:08:50,703 --> 00:08:52,527
that piggy ball that we're working on.

189
00:08:52,527 --> 00:08:55,434
So the gameplay mechanic starts with,

190
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:58,281
what if Pac-Man could get fatter while you ate?

191
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,951
then it ends up kind of turning all the levels

192
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,232
into a bit of a puzzle.

193
00:09:03,232 --> 00:09:05,753
I had to do an actual Pac-Man homage, of course,

194
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,634
but in this game you can barf on the ghosts

195
00:09:07,634 --> 00:09:09,535
and eat their skin off.

196
00:09:09,535 --> 00:09:10,876
It's cute gross, right?

197
00:09:10,876 --> 00:09:11,356
It's not terrible.

198
00:09:11,356 --> 00:09:14,678
Okay, so we start with that,

199
00:09:14,678 --> 00:09:16,499
and you actually, so you still have to eat

200
00:09:16,499 --> 00:09:18,100
all the balls in the level,

201
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,341
but now you can get stuck in the maze,

202
00:09:20,341 --> 00:09:22,562
and there's a lot of barf in some parts,

203
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,623
but then we expand to that.

204
00:09:24,623 --> 00:09:25,644
So I'm gonna walk you through a couple

205
00:09:25,644 --> 00:09:27,044
of the cool mechanics we introduce in there.

206
00:09:27,945 --> 00:09:31,007
So in World 2, there's an idea of the polarity cats,

207
00:09:31,007 --> 00:09:32,548
and they are like lucky cats,

208
00:09:32,548 --> 00:09:34,229
but there's a gold one and a black one.

209
00:09:34,229 --> 00:09:36,290
If you break the gold one, you just smash it apart

210
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,911
and you can pass through that spot.

211
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:41,453
If you break the black one, it explodes and hurts you.

212
00:09:41,453 --> 00:09:44,154
So we give the player a nice little level

213
00:09:44,154 --> 00:09:45,055
to play around with.

214
00:09:45,055 --> 00:09:48,377
The damage in this level doesn't affect the end goal,

215
00:09:48,377 --> 00:09:50,458
so they're free to goof off with it.

216
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,099
And if you notice, what happens is

217
00:09:52,099 --> 00:09:55,081
when you break any of the cats, they flip polarity.

218
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:56,682
Gold goes to black and vice versa.

219
00:09:57,922 --> 00:09:59,844
We do that because then later on, of course,

220
00:09:59,844 --> 00:10:01,285
we wanna introduce, we wanna get into

221
00:10:01,285 --> 00:10:02,786
more interesting levels.

222
00:10:02,786 --> 00:10:06,108
So this is like a looping level where they're on a track

223
00:10:06,108 --> 00:10:08,450
and the cats are blocking off these balls

224
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,331
that you have to eat.

225
00:10:10,331 --> 00:10:12,232
As you pass it around and you keep eating balls,

226
00:10:12,232 --> 00:10:14,274
you're getting bigger and bigger and at some point,

227
00:10:14,274 --> 00:10:17,156
you're gonna run into a spot that you might've screwed up

228
00:10:17,156 --> 00:10:18,977
and caused a black cat to be in your way.

229
00:10:18,977 --> 00:10:21,479
So that's more of like a puzzly level.

230
00:10:21,479 --> 00:10:23,460
But again, we introduced it nicely before

231
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,002
so the player could get their mind around that.

232
00:10:27,768 --> 00:10:30,351
In the game, there's these silly little creatures,

233
00:10:30,351 --> 00:10:32,814
the pill bugs, and they cause you all kinds of grief.

234
00:10:32,814 --> 00:10:34,977
There's all kinds of different types of them.

235
00:10:34,977 --> 00:10:37,560
This is a glutton pill bug, and he loves to eat.

236
00:10:38,065 --> 00:10:43,287
So, we basically make sure that you start out with a level you're sure to be able to beat,

237
00:10:43,287 --> 00:10:45,007
even though it's strange and confusing.

238
00:10:45,007 --> 00:10:49,549
You perturb the balls, they hit the conveyor belts, and the Glutton Bug gobbles them up.

239
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:51,830
Turns out he turns into a giant bowling ball, of sorts.

240
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:56,371
You know what the bowling ball is at this point in the game, but you've never seen him before.

241
00:10:56,371 --> 00:10:59,292
But you know you can't get through bowling pins without something.

242
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:00,473
And there you go, you're able to solve it.

243
00:11:01,609 --> 00:11:04,492
Later on, we get into really big, complicated levels,

244
00:11:04,492 --> 00:11:05,994
but you know what all these mechanics are

245
00:11:05,994 --> 00:11:06,855
as a player at this point.

246
00:11:06,855 --> 00:11:09,639
The player's in the middle, the glutton bug's on the right,

247
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:11,641
and then we've got super crates on the left,

248
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:14,024
which you have to be fat enough to break.

249
00:11:14,024 --> 00:11:15,906
There's spike walls, there's bowling pins,

250
00:11:15,906 --> 00:11:18,970
there's jelly blocks, there's barf goblins.

251
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,959
All that makes sense once you play the game.

252
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:23,880
So you're trying to get into the glutton bug there,

253
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,501
but you can't reach him yet.

254
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:28,062
You're eating the jelly blocks and you're going really fast

255
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,763
and you make it to, oh, the barf goblins.

256
00:11:29,763 --> 00:11:31,444
I can barf on those.

257
00:11:31,444 --> 00:11:33,225
They love it, don't worry, it's fine, they love that.

258
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,706
So and then they fly away and you can get into

259
00:11:35,706 --> 00:11:37,387
where they were blocking off some balls

260
00:11:37,387 --> 00:11:38,887
and then you get bigger and you get into more

261
00:11:38,887 --> 00:11:40,728
and more sections and the player can kind of like

262
00:11:40,728 --> 00:11:42,889
red paper clip their way through the levels.

263
00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:46,051
So all this is possible because of the level editor

264
00:11:46,051 --> 00:11:47,832
in the game, which we do ship with the game.

265
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,471
I loved the Mario Maker, I thought it was great.

266
00:11:50,471 --> 00:11:52,232
I thought it had a few little UI problems,

267
00:11:52,232 --> 00:11:53,653
which I tried to address,

268
00:11:53,653 --> 00:11:55,854
but we tried to make our level editor super nice.

269
00:11:55,854 --> 00:11:58,355
There's our object palette, it's very inviting.

270
00:11:58,355 --> 00:12:01,716
And basically, you're able to real easily

271
00:12:01,716 --> 00:12:02,897
play around with, goof off,

272
00:12:02,897 --> 00:12:05,538
with all these weird new mechanics we got in the game.

273
00:12:05,538 --> 00:12:07,018
You can share your own levels with friends,

274
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,579
you can share them with the world,

275
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:10,640
daily feature levels, all that kind of cool stuff.

276
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,961
There's beer, I'm sure we'll have to rate that

277
00:12:12,961 --> 00:12:13,901
or somehow for kids,

278
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:16,042
but there's consequences when you drink the beer,

279
00:12:16,042 --> 00:12:18,243
so hopefully it'll be okay.

280
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:23,867
So we're gonna talk about how methods we've looked at

281
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:25,871
to organize all this stuff in the game.

282
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,837
Before we get to that though, let's assume together

283
00:12:29,837 --> 00:12:34,379
that better tools are gonna help you make better games.

284
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:35,919
I'm sure somebody can make a house

285
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:38,360
without a hammer and a saw, but it wouldn't be great.

286
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,360
It'd be better with tools.

287
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,901
The same thing here, you're probably using Unity

288
00:12:41,901 --> 00:12:44,502
or Unreal or something like that to help you along,

289
00:12:44,502 --> 00:12:47,403
but consider that you might even wanna write

290
00:12:47,403 --> 00:12:49,444
some own custom tools for your game,

291
00:12:49,444 --> 00:12:50,665
even if you're a small studio.

292
00:12:52,569 --> 00:12:55,653
So, one of the easiest thing we can all use is paper, right?

293
00:12:55,653 --> 00:12:57,054
The cool part about paper is it's 2D.

294
00:12:57,054 --> 00:12:59,377
So if you're making a 2D and you can rearrange things

295
00:12:59,377 --> 00:13:01,439
and really easily balance things, that's great.

296
00:13:01,439 --> 00:13:04,323
But it's hard to share, you can't share it

297
00:13:04,323 --> 00:13:06,465
over the internet, it's not computer searchable,

298
00:13:06,465 --> 00:13:08,147
it's not ideal, but I'm sure we've all started there.

299
00:13:09,731 --> 00:13:11,413
I talked to Radu Marison.

300
00:13:11,413 --> 00:13:14,396
He's working on an upcoming puzzle game called Simispheres,

301
00:13:14,396 --> 00:13:17,159
and he used paper to balance his game.

302
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:19,841
He actually printed screenshots on his business cards

303
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:21,463
and were able to lay them out

304
00:13:21,463 --> 00:13:23,806
and rearrange his levels that way.

305
00:13:23,806 --> 00:13:26,128
The problem, of course, is when he adds new levels,

306
00:13:26,128 --> 00:13:29,251
he's gotta reprint his cards again to keep going.

307
00:13:29,251 --> 00:13:31,353
So he ended up digitizing that.

308
00:13:31,573 --> 00:13:33,734
in a program that's free that you guys could use

309
00:13:33,734 --> 00:13:36,635
called Inkscape, and he's got all his little slides

310
00:13:36,635 --> 00:13:38,215
and levels there that he can rearrange now

311
00:13:38,215 --> 00:13:39,955
and look for a better difficulty curve.

312
00:13:39,955 --> 00:13:41,056
I like to know what's in my levels

313
00:13:41,056 --> 00:13:45,997
because we've got so many levels going on,

314
00:13:45,997 --> 00:13:47,557
I wanna see what's going on.

315
00:13:47,557 --> 00:13:50,318
So early on I tried using Windows Search,

316
00:13:50,318 --> 00:13:54,099
like that folder search function that we all have access to,

317
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:55,219
and it actually works.

318
00:13:55,219 --> 00:13:57,660
It's not the best thing, but the way you gotta do it

319
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,320
basically is have a level format that's text-based,

320
00:14:01,098 --> 00:14:03,739
You have objects that have a word that you can search on,

321
00:14:03,739 --> 00:14:06,780
and then you just tell this index to build.

322
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,461
You have to rebuild the index on that folder.

323
00:14:08,461 --> 00:14:11,102
It does work, but it can take hours

324
00:14:11,102 --> 00:14:12,822
to really rebuild all that kind of stuff.

325
00:14:12,822 --> 00:14:13,842
So then if you change levels,

326
00:14:13,842 --> 00:14:16,043
you have to rebuild the index again.

327
00:14:16,043 --> 00:14:17,884
So it's not ideal, but it's there and it's free

328
00:14:17,884 --> 00:14:18,944
if you have Windows.

329
00:14:21,335 --> 00:14:22,996
Now something I hope everyone's using,

330
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:25,097
if you have any number of things to keep track of at all,

331
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,818
is some sort of online docs or sheets method.

332
00:14:27,818 --> 00:14:30,099
Of course, there's Google Docs and Google Sheets.

333
00:14:30,099 --> 00:14:32,741
They're really powerful and really useful.

334
00:14:32,741 --> 00:14:33,761
This is a screenshot of our,

335
00:14:33,761 --> 00:14:36,583
just a little clip of our world

336
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,464
where we keep track of the world,

337
00:14:38,464 --> 00:14:40,505
the level file names, the level titles,

338
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,686
the goals, and the meddling times

339
00:14:42,686 --> 00:14:43,747
on getting gold and silver.

340
00:14:44,427 --> 00:14:47,790
The problem with Google Docs is that you've got to update it.

341
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,092
And I don't know about you, but I get a little lazy.

342
00:14:50,092 --> 00:14:51,754
And then I have another designer that lives in a

343
00:14:51,754 --> 00:14:53,936
different state, and he's supposed to see what I'm doing

344
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:55,057
and vice versa.

345
00:14:55,057 --> 00:14:56,138
He doesn't always update it.

346
00:14:56,138 --> 00:14:57,359
It's critical.

347
00:14:57,359 --> 00:15:01,122
You should still use this, but it has some problems in terms

348
00:15:01,122 --> 00:15:01,503
of use.

349
00:15:03,573 --> 00:15:04,654
So I talked to another designer,

350
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:07,377
I think he's here at the show, Austin Borden, at RareSoft.

351
00:15:07,377 --> 00:15:09,138
They're making a big puzzle game on mobile

352
00:15:09,138 --> 00:15:09,919
called King Rabbit.

353
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:12,702
It has 512 levels, and they use it to see

354
00:15:12,702 --> 00:15:16,405
what kind of mechanics they're introducing for each world.

355
00:15:16,405 --> 00:15:19,508
Real simple, real nice, but it definitely helps them out.

356
00:15:19,508 --> 00:15:19,568
Now.

357
00:15:23,424 --> 00:15:27,566
Unity Analytics, you probably are using something like that.

358
00:15:27,566 --> 00:15:29,427
I talked to a different designer,

359
00:15:29,427 --> 00:15:32,669
and he is using his own custom system for analytics

360
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:35,070
that sounds intimidating, but it's not that bad.

361
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,171
Stuart Denman is working on a new puzzle game

362
00:15:37,171 --> 00:15:40,453
called Tiny Bubbles, where you were able to pop

363
00:15:40,453 --> 00:15:42,093
the little bubbles to create this chain reaction

364
00:15:42,093 --> 00:15:43,874
to solve the puzzle.

365
00:15:43,874 --> 00:15:47,296
He still stores his analytics like most of us,

366
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:49,477
but instead of a funnel, which is kind of junk

367
00:15:49,477 --> 00:15:51,538
in terms of seeing what's going on,

368
00:15:51,538 --> 00:15:52,859
he plots his own map.

369
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,442
And he stores the number of times somebody quits the level,

370
00:15:56,442 --> 00:15:59,643
and the number of times they had to replay it to beat it.

371
00:15:59,643 --> 00:16:02,425
Look at that gorgeousness, take it in.

372
00:16:02,425 --> 00:16:05,527
You can see exactly what's going on in his game.

373
00:16:05,527 --> 00:16:09,149
The red are problems, or are they?

374
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:11,631
Take control of your difficulty curves.

375
00:16:11,631 --> 00:16:13,732
Maybe he wants those spikes there,

376
00:16:13,732 --> 00:16:15,633
but he knows that they're there now.

377
00:16:15,633 --> 00:16:17,174
It's really cool to see.

378
00:16:17,174 --> 00:16:18,455
Stewart's at the show as well.

379
00:16:18,455 --> 00:16:20,096
His game's coming out in a little bit,

380
00:16:20,096 --> 00:16:20,977
you should check it out there.

381
00:16:22,852 --> 00:16:24,792
Now an older game, I talked to the guys that did

382
00:16:24,792 --> 00:16:27,273
Where's My Water with Tim FitzRandolph,

383
00:16:27,273 --> 00:16:29,134
and they used paper way back then,

384
00:16:29,134 --> 00:16:30,655
but it served them pretty well.

385
00:16:30,655 --> 00:16:32,055
They would print out screenshots

386
00:16:32,055 --> 00:16:33,376
of the Where's My Water puzzles

387
00:16:33,376 --> 00:16:35,457
and rearrange them as they needed to balance.

388
00:16:35,457 --> 00:16:37,637
But they also did this really cool solution

389
00:16:37,637 --> 00:16:40,599
where they had multiple designers working on hardware

390
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:41,619
on iPhones and iPads.

391
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,883
And the devices could look at a shared Dropbox folder

392
00:16:46,883 --> 00:16:50,126
and they could hot change little level fixes

393
00:16:50,126 --> 00:16:52,468
without going through the entire build process,

394
00:16:52,468 --> 00:16:54,629
which is kind of a pain in the butt for mobile.

395
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:57,232
And multiple designers could work off of all this together.

396
00:16:57,232 --> 00:16:58,292
That's something to think about.

397
00:16:58,292 --> 00:17:00,174
He said it was a little janky, but it worked.

398
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:07,994
In our own game, Piggyball, we do have the level editor,

399
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:11,176
and we've now got an in-level editor searchability

400
00:17:11,176 --> 00:17:14,498
for all the objects and mechanics we have in the game.

401
00:17:14,498 --> 00:17:16,640
And you could search for that glutton pill bug now,

402
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,762
and it filters all the levels that contain that one object.

403
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:23,545
And then you could also filter by world,

404
00:17:23,545 --> 00:17:25,186
by goal type, or anything like that.

405
00:17:27,219 --> 00:17:30,762
So here's another one where you could actually filter

406
00:17:30,762 --> 00:17:33,083
and combine the filters together to even see more

407
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,725
of where the levels line up together.

408
00:17:35,725 --> 00:17:39,108
So I'm working with John Meister from Super Soul.

409
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:41,770
He's in Kentucky and I'm at Mommy's Best in Indiana.

410
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,291
And we're working together on the game

411
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,313
and he's the one that implemented a lot of these

412
00:17:45,313 --> 00:17:46,954
cool features that I requested.

413
00:17:46,954 --> 00:17:49,075
The other thing he changed was

414
00:17:49,075 --> 00:17:51,857
we now have Google Sheets Export.

415
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:55,699
So the whole problem about being lazy about not updating your level data is now gone

416
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:59,781
because we get fresh level data as we build the levels.

417
00:17:59,781 --> 00:18:02,802
And what's cool is you don't have to be in the game to see this.

418
00:18:02,802 --> 00:18:05,122
Anyone can just get in on the team, can get on the Google Docs

419
00:18:05,122 --> 00:18:07,383
and just check out and see what's in the levels.

420
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,385
and you can even look at this heat map

421
00:18:10,385 --> 00:18:11,846
of objects in the levels.

422
00:18:11,846 --> 00:18:14,108
The way they built that was through,

423
00:18:14,108 --> 00:18:15,710
as the levels are loaded,

424
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,752
they would count up all the objects in the level

425
00:18:17,752 --> 00:18:20,194
and the level data and then store it out to an XML

426
00:18:20,194 --> 00:18:21,435
and then parse that.

427
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:22,596
It really wasn't that bad

428
00:18:22,596 --> 00:18:25,739
and John Meister's here at the show as well.

429
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:28,722
I talked to another designer, Ian Stalker,

430
00:18:28,722 --> 00:18:30,624
of the Escape Goat series.

431
00:18:30,624 --> 00:18:32,946
He had this really cool grid arrangement tool.

432
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,562
His level where the players play through the game

433
00:18:38,562 --> 00:18:40,142
to find levels, this is a little sketch,

434
00:18:40,142 --> 00:18:41,823
it was a 2D grid as the player made their way

435
00:18:41,823 --> 00:18:43,864
through the game.

436
00:18:43,864 --> 00:18:47,025
So he made this extra little tool, it wasn't terrible,

437
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:50,027
where there's the live part kind of in the middle

438
00:18:50,027 --> 00:18:52,428
and he could drag and drop levels into there

439
00:18:52,428 --> 00:18:54,589
and rearrange that based on playtest feedback

440
00:18:54,589 --> 00:18:57,290
to get a better feel for how players were having problems

441
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,111
or drop levels that weren't working.

442
00:18:59,111 --> 00:19:00,931
But he had control over that really easily

443
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,852
rather than just having it hard-coded in or something.

444
00:19:05,425 --> 00:19:07,486
I talked to another team, this little indie team,

445
00:19:07,486 --> 00:19:10,467
making this game called Candy Crush Saga.

446
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:13,567
Jeremy King from King, he gave a talk a couple years ago

447
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:15,708
on how Candy Crush Saga was built.

448
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,328
And there's some really good nuggets

449
00:19:17,328 --> 00:19:19,369
of information inside there.

450
00:19:19,369 --> 00:19:22,209
They have an internal tool called the level library.

451
00:19:22,209 --> 00:19:25,490
And they store the screenshots, the designer,

452
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:28,411
and the difficulty rated by the other designers

453
00:19:28,411 --> 00:19:29,471
of that level.

454
00:19:29,471 --> 00:19:31,291
And they can rearrange the levels as well.

455
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:32,492
But it gives them a little leg up

456
00:19:32,492 --> 00:19:33,752
on what they think it's gonna be like

457
00:19:33,752 --> 00:19:34,612
for players at the end.

458
00:19:35,915 --> 00:19:37,537
They also use Google Docs.

459
00:19:37,537 --> 00:19:40,640
They have a beat chart for where they're deciding

460
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,162
to introduce new mechanics there.

461
00:19:42,162 --> 00:19:43,703
I'm not sure if Jamie's at the show there,

462
00:19:43,703 --> 00:19:45,746
but he's a really nice guy and you can contact him

463
00:19:45,746 --> 00:19:48,268
for any questions as well based on his talk there.

464
00:19:48,268 --> 00:19:51,291
But I thought it was neat that even they

465
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:51,932
use this kind of thing.

466
00:19:51,932 --> 00:19:55,756
Catherine Neal gave a really cool talk

467
00:19:55,756 --> 00:19:58,739
called For When Spreadsheets and Flowcharts Aren't Enough.

468
00:19:59,412 --> 00:20:03,134
It's actually talk about tools for game design,

469
00:20:03,134 --> 00:20:05,116
not really production, but it was really interesting.

470
00:20:05,116 --> 00:20:07,738
Well, and that's another one that's free on the vault.

471
00:20:07,738 --> 00:20:09,619
You're probably asking like,

472
00:20:09,619 --> 00:20:12,021
oh gosh, does my game even need this?

473
00:20:12,021 --> 00:20:15,323
Well, I like to think of if you have more mechanics

474
00:20:15,323 --> 00:20:17,645
or levels that you can count on two hands

475
00:20:17,645 --> 00:20:20,147
and you've got at least two people on your team

476
00:20:20,147 --> 00:20:23,129
in different areas, you should be keeping track of it

477
00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:25,811
somehow, not scribble down on a piece of paper

478
00:20:25,811 --> 00:20:27,612
so that everybody can be on the same page.

479
00:20:29,834 --> 00:20:32,175
So we talked about the level design mindsets,

480
00:20:32,175 --> 00:20:35,035
the difficulty curves and the heartbeat idea,

481
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:38,476
and about making custom tools themselves.

482
00:20:38,476 --> 00:20:40,816
And right now, you could be using spreadsheets,

483
00:20:40,816 --> 00:20:43,737
you could use Inkscape, I didn't talk about Trello,

484
00:20:43,737 --> 00:20:44,977
but I'm sure a lot of you know about it,

485
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:47,118
but you could be using that to keep track of things

486
00:20:47,118 --> 00:20:48,678
and it's nice to rearrange.

487
00:20:48,678 --> 00:20:50,538
There's paper, there's even Windows Search.

488
00:20:50,538 --> 00:20:52,699
But hopefully you guys are gonna think about

489
00:20:52,699 --> 00:20:54,939
the idea of doing some custom tools for yourself,

490
00:20:54,939 --> 00:20:56,880
even on your smaller teams and how it could help you out.

491
00:20:58,316 --> 00:21:03,279
I'm Nathan Fouts from Mommy's Best Games. That little URL there in the middle links to all

492
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:09,242
the information in the talk site I covered. And Piggyball is on Fig. It's like Kickstarter, but

493
00:21:09,242 --> 00:21:13,465
only for games. If you guys could back it, I'd be eternally grateful. And thank you.

494
00:21:21,067 --> 00:21:23,848
And afterwards, all the level designers

495
00:21:23,848 --> 00:21:26,990
are gonna go over to the Marquis in the lobby

496
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,772
and hang out for a little while if you wanna chat and talk.

497
00:21:30,772 --> 00:21:35,595
And if anybody has a question, can do a question.

498
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:35,655
Yes.

499
00:21:35,655 --> 00:21:38,396
Hello, so I was wondering if you could talk about

500
00:21:38,396 --> 00:21:40,177
any mishaps that you had happen

501
00:21:40,177 --> 00:21:41,318
with your mechanics and levels

502
00:21:41,318 --> 00:21:44,720
before you had your organization methods set,

503
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,282
like any problems that came from not having these tools yet.

504
00:21:49,953 --> 00:21:51,974
Right, yeah, so for any problems,

505
00:21:51,974 --> 00:21:56,455
what did all these tools solve?

506
00:21:56,455 --> 00:21:59,276
We've been working on Piggyball for five years.

507
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,597
It's a big action puzzle game.

508
00:22:01,597 --> 00:22:02,877
I lost track of mechanics.

509
00:22:02,877 --> 00:22:04,818
There was gameplay objects that I forgot

510
00:22:04,818 --> 00:22:06,919
that I didn't even have or didn't even use,

511
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:07,719
and I found them.

512
00:22:07,719 --> 00:22:10,160
That's a ridiculous example, but it's true.

513
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,640
The big thing you should be able to get out of this

514
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,281
is difficulty balancing.

515
00:22:13,281 --> 00:22:15,001
Like I said, take control of your difficulty curve.

516
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16,142
So that should help.

517
00:22:19,586 --> 00:22:22,087
Hi, good talk by the way.

518
00:22:22,087 --> 00:22:22,387
Thanks.

519
00:22:22,387 --> 00:22:24,528
I'm a student right now for game design

520
00:22:24,528 --> 00:22:27,190
and I was curious if you're just using

521
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:30,691
all these different methods for building your whole design

522
00:22:30,691 --> 00:22:32,492
or are you actually making like say

523
00:22:32,492 --> 00:22:34,994
a full game design document for your games

524
00:22:34,994 --> 00:22:39,896
and then using these as add-on additions?

525
00:22:39,896 --> 00:22:44,798
My method is ad hoc and so I do start with the game design

526
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:47,760
but then I get a lot of ideas from iteration with tools.

527
00:22:48,638 --> 00:22:51,640
And I always say, you're gonna make an interesting game

528
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,301
out of different tools.

529
00:22:53,301 --> 00:22:55,042
So whatever custom tools you'll have,

530
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:58,503
you'll end up with something different.

531
00:22:58,503 --> 00:23:00,364
So for the media, they go together.

532
00:23:00,364 --> 00:23:03,766
Like I can't imagine planning something and sticking to it.

533
00:23:03,766 --> 00:23:07,468
100% all the way to the end, that sounds incredible.

534
00:23:07,468 --> 00:23:09,188
So that's what I got, man.

535
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:10,769
It's a mixture.

536
00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:11,530
Okay, thank you. Thanks.

537
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:14,732
Yeah, thanks for the talk, that was really interesting.

538
00:23:14,732 --> 00:23:19,817
My question is, with so many different game mechanics,

539
00:23:19,817 --> 00:23:24,861
and introducing those and the interactions between them,

540
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:27,063
when you're adding new mechanics and all the possibilities,

541
00:23:27,063 --> 00:23:30,626
how do you explore those, the different possibilities,

542
00:23:30,626 --> 00:23:33,048
and if new people join the team,

543
00:23:33,048 --> 00:23:37,772
how do you convey them efficiently to the new members?

544
00:23:39,455 --> 00:23:44,660
How do we introduce how do we decide what new mechanics are what and where they go?

545
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:50,005
Well first of all everybody that should joins a team that's on the production side should be playing the game

546
00:23:50,005 --> 00:23:51,927
So that that should get them into something and then um

547
00:23:51,927 --> 00:23:57,172
Where the new mechanics go it like it comes down to?

548
00:23:57,172 --> 00:24:01,757
What kind of physical work the player is going to have to do like to understand that new mechanic?

549
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:05,335
So it's like breaking a thing like those polarity cats.

550
00:24:05,335 --> 00:24:07,056
They're in world two because all you gotta do

551
00:24:07,056 --> 00:24:07,817
is just break a thing.

552
00:24:07,817 --> 00:24:10,419
And then your mind has to understand what they do.

553
00:24:10,419 --> 00:24:12,560
But like that glutton bug, you have to feed it

554
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,342
and then think of where it goes and then take it there.

555
00:24:15,342 --> 00:24:17,684
So I would say it's combined with that,

556
00:24:17,684 --> 00:24:20,026
balancing your puzzle and skill difficulty.

557
00:24:20,026 --> 00:24:23,849
For those two who are kind of magnified suddenly,

558
00:24:23,849 --> 00:24:26,411
I think that mechanic should go further into the game

559
00:24:26,411 --> 00:24:28,472
for what you're expecting out of the player.

560
00:24:28,472 --> 00:24:28,972
Thank you.

561
00:24:28,972 --> 00:24:29,373
Yep, thanks.

562
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:32,720
Cool, thanks guys.
