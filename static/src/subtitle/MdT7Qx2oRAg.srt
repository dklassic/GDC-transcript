1
00:00:07,946 --> 00:00:08,646
Thanks so much for coming.

2
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:09,407
I really appreciate it.

3
00:00:09,427 --> 00:00:10,568
My name is Mike Amender.

4
00:00:10,608 --> 00:00:12,449
I'm an experimental psychologist at Valve.

5
00:00:12,909 --> 00:00:15,210
I get to do a ton of different things there,

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,872
but one thing I focus on is hardware research,

7
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:18,952
or alternative hardware research,

8
00:00:18,972 --> 00:00:21,074
looking into input devices

9
00:00:21,114 --> 00:00:22,555
that might be around in the future.

10
00:00:23,395 --> 00:00:24,556
So the purpose of the talk today

11
00:00:24,596 --> 00:00:27,237
is to give you guys, or at least share our thoughts

12
00:00:27,337 --> 00:00:29,058
on how we think Valve feedback might be useful

13
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:31,320
going forward on this,

14
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,061
at least creating compelling new experiences for players.

15
00:00:35,822 --> 00:00:38,002
I'm going to be coming in kind of hot on this talk.

16
00:00:38,022 --> 00:00:38,722
I do apologize.

17
00:00:38,742 --> 00:00:40,043
There's a lot of material I want to cover.

18
00:00:40,783 --> 00:00:42,263
So I might be speaking a little bit quickly,

19
00:00:42,283 --> 00:00:43,223
because I do want to get through it all.

20
00:00:43,263 --> 00:00:45,584
But I promise to stay and answer any question you guys have.

21
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:47,964
All right, so let's get to it.

22
00:00:49,725 --> 00:00:51,765
So we talk about biofeedback and gameplay

23
00:00:51,805 --> 00:00:55,286
and how Valve is using physiology to hopefully enhance

24
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:56,146
gaming experience.

25
00:00:58,372 --> 00:01:00,653
Goals of this presentation, hopefully I'll give you guys

26
00:01:00,673 --> 00:01:02,034
an overview of what biofeedback is.

27
00:01:02,335 --> 00:01:03,616
We'll walk through potential applications.

28
00:01:03,676 --> 00:01:05,017
I'll show you some examples of things

29
00:01:05,037 --> 00:01:06,037
that we're doing at Valve.

30
00:01:06,878 --> 00:01:08,960
We'll discuss the different physiological measurement

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,642
techniques you can use in biofeedback testing,

32
00:01:11,662 --> 00:01:14,524
walk through some of the pros and cons, and then, I guess,

33
00:01:14,564 --> 00:01:15,725
intersperse throughout the talk.

34
00:01:16,345 --> 00:01:18,527
Well, I guess, I'll try and put in nuggets

35
00:01:18,587 --> 00:01:20,749
of kind of where we think this technology can

36
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:23,050
be taken in the future, what we think is possible with it.

37
00:01:25,401 --> 00:01:27,302
So let's start off by defining biofeedback.

38
00:01:27,662 --> 00:01:28,622
This is my definition.

39
00:01:28,902 --> 00:01:30,483
It's not really grammatically correct,

40
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:33,464
but essentially I wanted to kind of, I guess,

41
00:01:33,484 --> 00:01:35,004
give you a clear picture of what's possible,

42
00:01:35,044 --> 00:01:36,044
what we mean by biofeedback.

43
00:01:36,084 --> 00:01:37,505
And essentially it's the measurement, display,

44
00:01:37,885 --> 00:01:39,345
analysis, modification, manipulation,

45
00:01:39,385 --> 00:01:40,786
and response to physiological signals.

46
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,247
And what we're doing is recording biological signals

47
00:01:43,287 --> 00:01:45,527
from the body, performing analysis on them,

48
00:01:45,547 --> 00:01:47,408
displaying them, and presenting them back to the user

49
00:01:47,948 --> 00:01:49,449
in the hopes of kind of eliciting a response.

50
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:51,929
And the analysis part is actually a way

51
00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:52,910
of kind of quantifying.

52
00:01:53,761 --> 00:01:55,201
player sentiment or emotion.

53
00:01:55,761 --> 00:01:57,622
So it's a way of detecting signals from the body

54
00:01:58,202 --> 00:02:00,442
and saying, you know, this person's feeling frustrated

55
00:02:00,522 --> 00:02:04,243
or happy or aroused or sad or angry and so forth.

56
00:02:08,464 --> 00:02:11,664
One, I guess, one, I guess, thing to think about

57
00:02:11,684 --> 00:02:13,905
in terms of when you're doing this sort of research

58
00:02:13,965 --> 00:02:15,725
is that there is a feedback loop possible

59
00:02:15,785 --> 00:02:17,845
where signals you detect from people

60
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:20,706
or from users or from players have a feedback loop.

61
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,321
where if you're recording someone's heartbeat

62
00:02:23,441 --> 00:02:24,602
and you're displaying it to them

63
00:02:24,622 --> 00:02:25,682
and they see their heartbeat in real time,

64
00:02:25,702 --> 00:02:26,783
they see they're getting more aroused,

65
00:02:27,183 --> 00:02:30,325
that might induce a further increase in arousal.

66
00:02:30,365 --> 00:02:31,465
So you get kind of a feedback loop

67
00:02:32,025 --> 00:02:34,046
where subsequent signals depend on prior states

68
00:02:34,727 --> 00:02:35,727
or prior emotional states.

69
00:02:36,247 --> 00:02:37,668
And one thing to keep in mind beyond that

70
00:02:37,728 --> 00:02:39,349
is that when we talk about emotion,

71
00:02:39,929 --> 00:02:41,770
people are not stable, emotions are not stable,

72
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:42,990
they're transient, they're volatile,

73
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,491
and they're subject to manipulation.

74
00:02:45,211 --> 00:02:47,372
So we can record emotion in real time,

75
00:02:47,392 --> 00:02:48,573
but it doesn't necessarily mean that.

76
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:49,889
because someone's feeling aroused now,

77
00:02:49,929 --> 00:02:51,350
they're gonna be aroused five seconds from now,

78
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,790
or a minute from now, or an hour from now, and so forth.

79
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,991
And so, you know, it gets a little tricky

80
00:02:56,031 --> 00:02:57,091
when you're kind of doing analysis,

81
00:02:57,111 --> 00:03:00,132
at least, you know, post-hoc, on physiological signals.

82
00:03:01,492 --> 00:03:03,653
I guess it's important to keep in mind that, you know,

83
00:03:03,673 --> 00:03:06,353
you're looking at beat-to-beat measurements of emotion

84
00:03:06,413 --> 00:03:07,854
or arousal of physiological signals,

85
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:10,054
and it's not necessarily something that could be stable

86
00:03:10,094 --> 00:03:10,875
or could be long-term.

87
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:15,016
Just a visualization of kind of, you know,

88
00:03:15,036 --> 00:03:16,556
the biofeedback loop, where you start with a...

89
00:03:19,775 --> 00:03:20,436
No more laser pointer.

90
00:03:20,476 --> 00:03:23,337
You start at the top of the loop.

91
00:03:23,357 --> 00:03:24,958
You can see we start with a physiological response.

92
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:26,699
It provides an input to a system.

93
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,781
The system performs analysis on that, creates a response,

94
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,542
outputs that back to the player, which

95
00:03:31,562 --> 00:03:33,383
can induce a further physiological response.

96
00:03:33,823 --> 00:03:34,884
So this is the feedback loop I was

97
00:03:34,904 --> 00:03:37,585
talking about in terms of biofeedback mechanics.

98
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:40,927
So why are we interested in biofeedback?

99
00:03:41,247 --> 00:03:41,968
What's so great about it?

100
00:03:42,128 --> 00:03:44,309
Well, if you think about current control schemes,

101
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:47,151
your mouse and your keyboard, your gamepad, and so forth,

102
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:48,392
they provide one-dimensional input.

103
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,481
But one dimension, what I mean is that they're mapping player intent to on-screen action.

104
00:03:54,781 --> 00:03:57,362
So, you know, the player wants to fire a gun, he presses the B button.

105
00:03:58,182 --> 00:04:00,883
The player wants to accelerate their car, they hold down the right trigger.

106
00:04:00,903 --> 00:04:03,663
Things like that. You're mapping player intent to an on-screen action.

107
00:04:04,463 --> 00:04:06,484
What you don't get with current control schemes, at least at the moment,

108
00:04:07,064 --> 00:04:10,544
are other aspects of cognition, maybe long-term planning.

109
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:13,285
You might not know what the player is planning to do five minutes from now,

110
00:04:13,325 --> 00:04:14,345
what the long-term strategy is.

111
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,486
And you're also most likely ignoring player sentiment.

112
00:04:17,626 --> 00:04:18,446
How is the player feeling?

113
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:25,213
So there are other aspects of gameplay, or at least the player's experience, that are not visible through current control schemes.

114
00:04:25,293 --> 00:04:27,995
And so we'd like to attack that problem. We'd like to see if, you know,

115
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,136
investigating

116
00:04:30,697 --> 00:04:36,501
you know, these other axes of input, whether it's other aspects of cognition or player sentiment, and see if we can create better gameplay experiences

117
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:37,001
because of it.

118
00:04:38,122 --> 00:04:41,544
So here's just a silly little metaphor where, you know, you're mapping player intent

119
00:04:42,505 --> 00:04:46,587
to traditional control schemes, and you get kind of a fuzzy picture of the player's experience.

120
00:04:48,035 --> 00:04:49,956
You'll see I have a game pad, and a mouse, and a keyboard.

121
00:04:49,976 --> 00:04:52,278
I don't have Connect, and Wiimote, and 6Sense,

122
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:54,640
and SunnyMove style devices up there.

123
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:57,762
I'm going to ignore the natural user interface

124
00:04:57,863 --> 00:04:59,384
devices in this talk, not because we

125
00:04:59,404 --> 00:05:00,525
don't think they have potential, and not

126
00:05:00,565 --> 00:05:02,806
because they can't be used for about feedback type,

127
00:05:03,627 --> 00:05:04,268
I guess, measurements.

128
00:05:04,308 --> 00:05:06,910
But right now, they're commonly used for, again,

129
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,351
mapping player intent.

130
00:05:08,371 --> 00:05:11,473
You're swinging a baseball bat, you're waggling the Wiimote,

131
00:05:11,713 --> 00:05:12,774
or whatever.

132
00:05:12,914 --> 00:05:14,796
You're mapping player intent, again, to on-screen action.

133
00:05:15,196 --> 00:05:16,597
They're not used as much for about feedback.

134
00:05:16,961 --> 00:05:18,261
And also because I wanted to make this more

135
00:05:18,281 --> 00:05:19,301
of a future-facing talk.

136
00:05:19,602 --> 00:05:22,042
I wanted to talk about less common technologies and not

137
00:05:22,082 --> 00:05:23,562
mass market devices that are available now.

138
00:05:24,003 --> 00:05:25,343
So it's kind of like, what's going

139
00:05:25,363 --> 00:05:26,603
to be possible in the future?

140
00:05:27,183 --> 00:05:28,764
So again, I'm not ignoring them because we

141
00:05:28,784 --> 00:05:30,324
don't think they're valuable, but just

142
00:05:30,344 --> 00:05:32,385
because we wanted to make this more future-facing.

143
00:05:34,185 --> 00:05:35,665
So again, why allow feedback?

144
00:05:35,685 --> 00:05:36,766
I've been kind of touching on this,

145
00:05:36,846 --> 00:05:39,166
but we think that adding player sentiment into the equation

146
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:40,727
will create better gameplay experiences.

147
00:05:41,397 --> 00:05:48,139
It's a new and it's been mostly ignored dimension of the player's experience in most games and pretty much all games.

148
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:52,961
And so we think it's possible if you add this component into the gameplay experience, you can create, you know,

149
00:05:52,981 --> 00:05:58,623
it's kind of a stock sentence, but it's true, we think, you can create more immersive, dynamic, and calibrated game experiences.

150
00:05:59,303 --> 00:06:03,525
You can adapt the gameplay or the game to how the player is feeling at a given point in time

151
00:06:03,685 --> 00:06:05,525
and hopefully create a better experience because of it.

152
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:09,358
So we go back to my silly little metaphor.

153
00:06:09,378 --> 00:06:12,420
You can see I like using Windows Clipart or PowerPoint Clipart.

154
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,222
But we're wrapping player sentiment

155
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,303
to traditional controllers.

156
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,124
You see a fuzzy picture of the player's experience.

157
00:06:18,164 --> 00:06:19,906
You add in physiological signals.

158
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:20,866
And if it gets better, right?

159
00:06:20,886 --> 00:06:23,108
At least we hope it does.

160
00:06:23,808 --> 00:06:24,709
If it doesn't, that's fine.

161
00:06:24,749 --> 00:06:25,970
And hopefully we'll learn something along the way.

162
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,592
But we think that we can create a better gameplay experience

163
00:06:28,632 --> 00:06:33,055
if we add in notions of arousal or emotion or whatnot.

164
00:06:34,626 --> 00:06:38,289
So let's get to, let's actually walk through how we do this sort of research.

165
00:06:38,609 --> 00:06:41,671
So we need to define emotion. If we want to measure player emotion, we need to define it.

166
00:06:42,292 --> 00:06:45,314
Again, this is my definition. It can be fuzzy, that's fine.

167
00:06:45,594 --> 00:06:50,358
But I view it as a subjective internal state induced by a response to external events,

168
00:06:51,138 --> 00:06:53,640
at least for the purposes of this research.

169
00:06:54,301 --> 00:06:57,803
And if you want to think about ways in which you could analyze emotion, you can think of it as a vector.

170
00:06:58,404 --> 00:07:00,105
So the vector has a magnitude and direction.

171
00:07:00,806 --> 00:07:04,408
In this case, the magnitude of the emotion vector is arousal.

172
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:05,609
So how strong is it?

173
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,470
And the direction of the emotion vector is the valence.

174
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,671
So the positivity or negativity.

175
00:07:09,691 --> 00:07:11,331
Is it a positive emotion or a negative emotion?

176
00:07:11,852 --> 00:07:13,132
And just with those two components,

177
00:07:14,212 --> 00:07:16,653
you can create, you can get kind of a nice feel

178
00:07:16,673 --> 00:07:19,294
for how you can map different emotions onto this axis.

179
00:07:19,754 --> 00:07:21,235
So you look at the Y axis,

180
00:07:21,255 --> 00:07:23,496
you can see arousal going from negative to positive.

181
00:07:23,896 --> 00:07:25,796
X axis is valence going from negative to positive.

182
00:07:25,836 --> 00:07:28,017
And so you can see, well, if someone's, you know,

183
00:07:28,677 --> 00:07:30,638
kind of at a medium level of arousal

184
00:07:30,858 --> 00:07:31,878
and it's really, really positive,

185
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:32,839
well, they're happy, right?

186
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:35,354
kind of not really aroused at all,

187
00:07:36,314 --> 00:07:38,355
and it's somewhat negative, they might be fatigued.

188
00:07:38,735 --> 00:07:40,115
If they're really negatively aroused,

189
00:07:40,476 --> 00:07:41,936
or sorry, really highly aroused,

190
00:07:41,976 --> 00:07:43,497
and it's a really negative emotion, they might be angry.

191
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:45,757
So if you can measure valence,

192
00:07:46,198 --> 00:07:47,298
so positivity or negativity,

193
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:48,498
and you can measure emotion,

194
00:07:48,558 --> 00:07:50,359
you can do quite, or sorry, you can measure arousal,

195
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,900
you can do quite a lot in terms of actually

196
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,701
ascertaining what the player is feeling,

197
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:56,601
what emotions they're feeling,

198
00:07:56,641 --> 00:08:00,062
whether it's jubilance or being happy, content,

199
00:08:00,082 --> 00:08:01,923
relaxed, engaged, bored, fatigued, and so forth.

200
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:10,644
So the physiological signals I'll walk through, and again, there are lots more that I'm not going to talk about today, but here are five common ones.

201
00:08:10,984 --> 00:08:13,946
Heart rate, SCL, which is your skin conductance level.

202
00:08:14,186 --> 00:08:20,770
It's essentially how much energy your pH content of your sweat changes and you can conduct more current through your skin at any point in time.

203
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,791
It's correlated with arousal.

204
00:08:22,311 --> 00:08:24,513
It's the same thing as GSR, galvanic skin response.

205
00:08:24,633 --> 00:08:26,013
So those two terms are interchangeable.

206
00:08:26,734 --> 00:08:28,015
Facial expressions, eye movements.

207
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,384
EEGs, then I'll mention that there are, like, you could look at pupil dilation, body temperature,

208
00:08:33,444 --> 00:08:37,107
posture, and so forth. But I'm only going to really talk about the first five.

209
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:44,232
So let's start with heart rate. It's a beat-to-beat interval of blood flow. Basically,

210
00:08:44,372 --> 00:08:48,995
you've got to measure index of arousal here. You can measure baseline rates and changes over time.

211
00:08:49,415 --> 00:08:54,159
And there's some research that indicates you can actually deconvolve the components of the

212
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:55,480
heartbeat waveform and actually get...

213
00:08:56,285 --> 00:09:00,328
you know, more complex emotions like maybe engagement or boredom and whatnot.

214
00:09:00,408 --> 00:09:04,672
So like I have the diagram on the right is the P or the QRS complex.

215
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:08,635
It's kind of the main spike of the waveform and there are various ratios involved there

216
00:09:08,655 --> 00:09:11,538
that people think if you look at kind of the patterns of, you know,

217
00:09:11,558 --> 00:09:13,400
the patterns of the QRS complex in various folks

218
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,462
that you can actually get more complex emotions beyond just arousal.

219
00:09:16,943 --> 00:09:20,946
But it's a little bit hazy, but I wanted to mention it because it is a potential possibility.

220
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:25,634
For each metric, I'll have kind of a pros and cons slide,

221
00:09:25,674 --> 00:09:27,235
just so you can get kind of like a quick summary of

222
00:09:28,256 --> 00:09:29,657
what's good and what's bad about these things.

223
00:09:30,358 --> 00:09:33,260
Heart rate is, you know, it's got a great index of arousal,

224
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,282
very cheap to do, very common, people are familiar with it,

225
00:09:36,322 --> 00:09:39,704
very easy to measure, and you can possibly do some

226
00:09:39,904 --> 00:09:41,725
advanced math to get valence with it.

227
00:09:42,426 --> 00:09:44,247
Problems with it is that it's prone to movement artifacts.

228
00:09:44,707 --> 00:09:47,770
Actually, I had to cut a slide of a mouse we made that

229
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,211
had a heartbeat, we actually had a heartbeat mouse

230
00:09:50,231 --> 00:09:50,732
where you could.

231
00:09:51,264 --> 00:09:53,086
had a blood volume sensor and you could detect heartbeat

232
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:54,847
just by having your hand on the mouse,

233
00:09:54,907 --> 00:09:56,708
but we get movement artifacts because of that.

234
00:09:56,768 --> 00:09:59,551
And so you kind of need to find a stable place on the body

235
00:09:59,571 --> 00:10:00,652
to measure heart rate,

236
00:10:00,672 --> 00:10:03,414
otherwise you're gonna add noise into the equation.

237
00:10:04,134 --> 00:10:06,096
You also get a delayed onset to stimuli.

238
00:10:06,196 --> 00:10:08,698
So you don't actually know what events are eliciting

239
00:10:08,718 --> 00:10:09,959
increases in arousal necessarily

240
00:10:09,979 --> 00:10:12,541
because heartbeat increases gradually.

241
00:10:12,561 --> 00:10:14,883
I mean, you can get that pulse pounding effect sometimes,

242
00:10:14,983 --> 00:10:16,124
but I'm still, heartbeat,

243
00:10:16,444 --> 00:10:17,625
especially compared to other metrics

244
00:10:18,065 --> 00:10:19,467
has kind of a longer lead time.

245
00:10:20,234 --> 00:10:22,536
And then again, I said you could possibly do the math

246
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:24,037
to get valence, but right now it's really difficult

247
00:10:24,077 --> 00:10:26,079
to determine if it's a positive or negative emotion.

248
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:27,520
You just know that someone's aroused.

249
00:10:30,102 --> 00:10:31,803
SCL, again, skin conductance level.

250
00:10:32,344 --> 00:10:34,306
This is measuring the electrical resistance of the skin.

251
00:10:34,546 --> 00:10:36,187
Basically, it could be you're sweating more,

252
00:10:36,207 --> 00:10:38,209
but it's actually the pH content of your sweat changes.

253
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:40,190
You can conduct more current through your skin.

254
00:10:40,751 --> 00:10:43,453
And what you get is, essentially,

255
00:10:43,513 --> 00:10:45,034
the more current you can conduct

256
00:10:45,094 --> 00:10:46,395
is very highly correlated with arousal.

257
00:10:46,756 --> 00:10:48,637
So you get a waveform of arousal over time,

258
00:10:48,657 --> 00:10:49,518
which is actually pretty useful.

259
00:10:49,978 --> 00:10:52,179
And probably the coolest aspect of SEL

260
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,461
is that you get spikes that usually have a lag time

261
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:57,482
about one to three seconds, maybe two to five seconds,

262
00:10:57,502 --> 00:10:58,462
depending on who you talk to,

263
00:10:59,202 --> 00:11:00,783
in response to eliciting events.

264
00:11:01,363 --> 00:11:03,524
So if someone is having a SEL measure,

265
00:11:03,564 --> 00:11:05,005
I come up behind them and startle them,

266
00:11:05,025 --> 00:11:07,346
you'll see a spike, like an arousal,

267
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:08,886
like one or two seconds later in the waveform,

268
00:11:08,986 --> 00:11:09,707
which is pretty cool.

269
00:11:10,107 --> 00:11:13,108
So you get almost instantaneous responses.

270
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:17,170
Pros and cons of SEL, so it's a great index of arousal.

271
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:18,917
Tonic and phasic responses.

272
00:11:18,937 --> 00:11:20,937
So tonic just refers to the overall level of arousal

273
00:11:20,957 --> 00:11:21,397
over time.

274
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:24,858
So like heartbeat, you can tell generally

275
00:11:24,878 --> 00:11:27,078
where folks are being highly aroused or not.

276
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:29,319
And you get the phasic responses, which are the spikes.

277
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,919
So these just kind of transient little blips in arousal

278
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,580
that we could actually do cool things with in gameplay.

279
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,521
So again, minimal lag to stimuli, very cheap,

280
00:11:39,201 --> 00:11:40,121
very robust to movement.

281
00:11:41,161 --> 00:11:43,562
We actually have a mouse that you can.

282
00:11:44,591 --> 00:11:46,192
The sensors are located on the palm,

283
00:11:46,232 --> 00:11:47,272
and it works pretty well.

284
00:11:47,312 --> 00:11:47,852
People can move around.

285
00:11:47,872 --> 00:11:48,372
It's not a problem.

286
00:11:48,392 --> 00:11:49,953
And you can measure in a lot of different places.

287
00:11:50,733 --> 00:11:52,914
We're focusing on easy-to-use devices that

288
00:11:52,934 --> 00:11:54,035
are kind of tied to the hands.

289
00:11:54,095 --> 00:11:56,395
But you could measure up by the mastoid process.

290
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:57,776
You could actually do heartbeat here, actually,

291
00:11:57,836 --> 00:12:00,377
if you had a headset and had a clip here.

292
00:12:01,277 --> 00:12:04,619
But yeah, it's pretty robust and pretty intuitive, I guess,

293
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,559
or at least pretty easy to use.

294
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,380
One problem, although, again, you can get the spikes.

295
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,301
Because it is a waveform, or because it can be noisy,

296
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:12,422
it can be difficult sometimes.

297
00:12:12,828 --> 00:12:13,809
to associated listening events,

298
00:12:13,849 --> 00:12:15,650
especially if you have multiple events in combination.

299
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,710
If you're playing an action game,

300
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,731
it can be difficult to determine which event

301
00:12:19,032 --> 00:12:20,772
actually caused the spike if a lot is going on.

302
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:22,994
Again, difficult to determine valence,

303
00:12:23,014 --> 00:12:24,874
you know, it requires interpretation,

304
00:12:25,835 --> 00:12:28,376
which is not something that we want to do necessarily,

305
00:12:28,436 --> 00:12:31,258
but it's something that we kind of have to

306
00:12:31,298 --> 00:12:33,239
because we don't really get valence, we only get arousal.

307
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:37,061
And one other interesting, I guess, concern with SEL

308
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:38,821
is the range is variable across subjects.

309
00:12:39,162 --> 00:12:40,222
So you can get people who go from,

310
00:12:40,723 --> 00:12:43,065
you know, essentially it's one microsiemens to like two,

311
00:12:43,085 --> 00:12:44,946
you know, they could be really highly arousal

312
00:12:45,006 --> 00:12:46,668
and someone else could go from like two microsiemens

313
00:12:46,688 --> 00:12:47,388
at baseline to like 15.

314
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,270
And so is that the same thing?

315
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,891
Like, you know, is that two to 15 range

316
00:12:51,211 --> 00:12:52,512
equivalent to a one to two range?

317
00:12:52,532 --> 00:12:54,374
And how do you map, you know,

318
00:12:54,554 --> 00:12:55,635
the subjective feeling of arousal

319
00:12:55,655 --> 00:12:57,316
that someone is feeling to those ranges?

320
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:58,277
So it's something to think about

321
00:12:58,317 --> 00:12:59,278
is that the range is a lot variable,

322
00:12:59,298 --> 00:13:00,059
whereas, you know, in heartbeat,

323
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,800
you know, people, typical resting heartbeats,

324
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,842
you know, fall in, you know, the 50 to 80 range.

325
00:13:03,942 --> 00:13:05,103
And, you know, you can kind of compute

326
00:13:05,443 --> 00:13:06,624
maximum heartbeat based upon.

327
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:08,790
you know, age and gender and so forth.

328
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,731
But with SEL, it's a little bit trickier.

329
00:13:14,073 --> 00:13:15,294
So facial expressions,

330
00:13:16,174 --> 00:13:18,276
this is just recording movement of the facial expressions,

331
00:13:18,516 --> 00:13:19,476
or sorry, facial muscles.

332
00:13:20,817 --> 00:13:22,518
It's really good at classifying emotion.

333
00:13:22,798 --> 00:13:24,939
You can get both balance and arousal pretty well

334
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,421
by recording someone's face.

335
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:29,702
You can do this remotely with cameras

336
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,523
and have people code after the fact.

337
00:13:31,883 --> 00:13:33,064
There are companies that are starting

338
00:13:33,124 --> 00:13:35,606
to try and automate this process, which would be amazing.

339
00:13:35,626 --> 00:13:36,246
I don't know.

340
00:13:37,194 --> 00:13:39,155
I don't want to evaluate them here in this talk,

341
00:13:39,175 --> 00:13:40,596
but it's something that people are thinking about.

342
00:13:41,336 --> 00:13:43,758
You can also do it intrusively via EMG, which

343
00:13:43,838 --> 00:13:44,918
is electromyography.

344
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,880
Essentially, it's just putting sensors

345
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,380
on various facial muscles, and you

346
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,461
can measure how much they contract.

347
00:13:49,521 --> 00:13:52,343
And you get really good measurements

348
00:13:52,403 --> 00:13:54,604
of what someone is feeling at any given point in time.

349
00:13:56,325 --> 00:13:58,827
So again, the work on facial expressions

350
00:13:58,847 --> 00:14:01,028
has been around for a really long time.

351
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,349
It's well established.

352
00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:04,390
So here, this is the example of six.

353
00:14:07,517 --> 00:14:13,180
I guess, canonical human emotions, anger, surprise, disgust, sadness, happiness, and fear.

354
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,401
And so you can detect all of these pretty readily.

355
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:19,163
And you can detect the magnitude of these pretty readily by recording facial expressions.

356
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:24,746
So the pros and cons, you know, it's great index surveillance, great index arousal.

357
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:27,628
So you get the full picture of emotion and you get this instantaneously.

358
00:14:27,648 --> 00:14:30,809
You know, people, you know, your faces will respond involuntarily.

359
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:33,811
I'm really bad at it. I can't hide my emotions even as much as I try.

360
00:14:33,851 --> 00:14:34,732
And so I will respond.

361
00:14:35,243 --> 00:14:37,444
really quickly and it can be frustrating,

362
00:14:37,484 --> 00:14:40,485
but again, at least in terms of its potential applicability

363
00:14:40,545 --> 00:14:43,546
to as an input to gameplay,

364
00:14:43,587 --> 00:14:45,447
having this instantaneous response is pretty cool.

365
00:14:46,088 --> 00:14:48,709
People will respond almost automatically to various things.

366
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,650
The downsides, definitely intrusive,

367
00:14:52,751 --> 00:14:54,471
if people don't like having a camera on them

368
00:14:54,571 --> 00:14:56,072
or if you actually have the sensors on you,

369
00:14:56,112 --> 00:14:57,293
it's crazy intrusive.

370
00:14:57,893 --> 00:14:58,793
It's expensive at the moment,

371
00:14:59,513 --> 00:15:00,974
both in terms of time and money.

372
00:15:01,114 --> 00:15:03,635
Again, people are working on bringing this down to.

373
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,551
automation through webcam, but we're kind of not there yet.

374
00:15:07,591 --> 00:15:09,371
And processing requires a lot.

375
00:15:09,391 --> 00:15:11,052
If you have a human coder who's watching people

376
00:15:11,112 --> 00:15:12,852
and categorizing, that can take a while.

377
00:15:13,432 --> 00:15:15,912
And if it is a human coder, they can be subject to bias.

378
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:17,593
And then they also require training.

379
00:15:17,673 --> 00:15:21,354
But if you're depending on some kind of automated system,

380
00:15:21,634 --> 00:15:22,754
it's a black box, right?

381
00:15:22,774 --> 00:15:25,514
We'd like to kind of validate these techniques ourselves.

382
00:15:25,714 --> 00:15:27,395
SCL and Heartbeat, it's a lot easier to do that

383
00:15:27,795 --> 00:15:32,436
with software that's evaluating folks out of our hands.

384
00:15:32,476 --> 00:15:33,376
We don't like that, actually.

385
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,216
That's kind of a

386
00:15:34,744 --> 00:15:36,486
a personal preference, but we want to kind of validate

387
00:15:36,506 --> 00:15:38,728
these things in-house, and so you do have to kind of depend

388
00:15:38,808 --> 00:15:41,690
on external algorithms to make determinations.

389
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,932
And so it's up to you as to kind of how valid

390
00:15:43,952 --> 00:15:44,593
that ends up being.

391
00:15:44,753 --> 00:15:46,634
But I mean, just in terms of the potential applicability,

392
00:15:46,694 --> 00:15:48,476
facial expressions have a lot of promise.

393
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:53,020
Fourth one is, so eye movements.

394
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,502
Basically, we're just tracking where people are looking

395
00:15:55,562 --> 00:15:56,102
in real time.

396
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:59,545
So you can use remote or head-mounted cameras

397
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:01,147
to measure the reflectivity off of people

398
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:02,428
as you shine an infrared light off the people.

399
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:05,279
bounces off, and you can kind of get an idea of where someone

400
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:05,819
is gazing.

401
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,461
So you get a real-time record of where people are looking.

402
00:16:09,922 --> 00:16:12,043
And we require both eye movements and fixations.

403
00:16:12,103 --> 00:16:13,223
Eye movements are called saccades.

404
00:16:13,824 --> 00:16:15,405
Fixations, when the eye is stopped moving,

405
00:16:15,465 --> 00:16:16,925
or its eye is always really moving,

406
00:16:16,965 --> 00:16:18,906
but when the eye kind of centers on something

407
00:16:19,647 --> 00:16:21,968
for a little while, that's kind of like an index of processing.

408
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:26,711
And I guess it's just a fun fact.

409
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:28,832
So when your eye is actually moving, when you're saccading,

410
00:16:29,492 --> 00:16:30,913
visual input to the brain is suppressed.

411
00:16:31,438 --> 00:16:33,559
And so since we're making eye movements for about 2 and 1

412
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:36,361
hours per day, you're effectively blind about 2

413
00:16:36,521 --> 00:16:37,281
and 1 hours per day.

414
00:16:37,441 --> 00:16:38,142
And we don't realize it.

415
00:16:38,982 --> 00:16:41,524
Just kind of something to keep in mind.

416
00:16:41,644 --> 00:16:43,965
So if you think about display is where you update the display

417
00:16:44,306 --> 00:16:45,967
when the eyes are moving, you could do whatever you wanted.

418
00:16:46,007 --> 00:16:48,628
And people wouldn't detect it until they stop moving.

419
00:16:48,668 --> 00:16:50,529
And so it's just there's a lot of potential use there,

420
00:16:50,549 --> 00:16:53,251
at least in terms of introducing surprising elements

421
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:54,532
into the display when eyes are moving.

422
00:16:54,852 --> 00:16:55,692
We're a ways away from that.

423
00:16:55,812 --> 00:16:57,413
But again, trying to think about what

424
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,514
could be possible in the future.

425
00:16:59,457 --> 00:17:01,578
So here's an actual, I'll just show you guys a quick video

426
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:03,860
of eye tracking, this is Portal 2,

427
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,262
so if you don't want any spoilers

428
00:17:06,302 --> 00:17:08,064
or see any levels in Portal 2, you can look away,

429
00:17:08,084 --> 00:17:09,525
I'll let you know when the video's over.

430
00:17:09,545 --> 00:17:13,648
But yeah, just a quick video of someone playing Portal 2

431
00:17:13,789 --> 00:17:15,010
and visually consuming a map.

432
00:17:18,032 --> 00:17:20,594
So the red circles are fixations,

433
00:17:20,634 --> 00:17:21,895
the size of the circle is proportional

434
00:17:21,955 --> 00:17:23,417
to the length of time spent fixating,

435
00:17:23,577 --> 00:17:24,558
so when the eyes have stopped moving,

436
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,499
and then the lines connecting the circles

437
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,461
are the saccades, the eye movements.

438
00:17:33,934 --> 00:17:36,195
And so we actually, again, the focus of this talk

439
00:17:36,235 --> 00:17:38,156
is not really on playtesting, but we do use these a lot

440
00:17:38,216 --> 00:17:40,337
in playtesting in terms of determining

441
00:17:40,357 --> 00:17:42,137
how people are consuming our levels.

442
00:17:42,497 --> 00:17:44,438
You can actually do, and I had to cut these slides,

443
00:17:44,478 --> 00:17:47,499
unfortunately, you can actually do quantification

444
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:49,600
of eye movements and determine kind of what

445
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,761
cognitive mode people are in.

446
00:17:51,861 --> 00:17:53,421
Like there's different patterns of eye movements

447
00:17:53,442 --> 00:17:56,022
that correspond to maybe scanning the display,

448
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:57,223
just visually consuming it,

449
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,824
versus searching for a particular item,

450
00:17:58,844 --> 00:17:59,744
versus problem solving.

451
00:17:59,764 --> 00:18:00,724
You can actually quantify these

452
00:18:00,764 --> 00:18:01,685
based on the trajectory.

453
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:04,200
of the eye movements and the length of,

454
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,641
I guess the length and number of fixations.

455
00:18:05,681 --> 00:18:08,763
And so, we'd like to think about that in the future

456
00:18:08,783 --> 00:18:10,524
in terms of like when we're play testing our games.

457
00:18:10,584 --> 00:18:11,484
Is that okay, we're like, you know,

458
00:18:11,644 --> 00:18:13,165
we can tell what people are doing

459
00:18:13,205 --> 00:18:13,925
at any given point in time.

460
00:18:13,965 --> 00:18:15,746
And so you get rudimentary insight into cognition

461
00:18:15,826 --> 00:18:17,787
just from where people's attention is landing,

462
00:18:17,988 --> 00:18:19,008
or at least where they're looking,

463
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:20,809
which we think is pretty powerful.

464
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,291
So pros and cons of eye movements.

465
00:18:24,551 --> 00:18:25,532
It's an index of attention, right?

466
00:18:25,552 --> 00:18:27,953
So it's not, you know, as tied to emotion

467
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:28,533
as some of the other.

468
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,842
I guess some of the other physiological signals,

469
00:18:31,922 --> 00:18:33,883
but again, you know, it's still pretty useful.

470
00:18:33,984 --> 00:18:36,145
And as I mentioned, it could be a rudimentary index

471
00:18:36,646 --> 00:18:37,046
of thought.

472
00:18:37,386 --> 00:18:38,867
And if you couple this with pupil dilation,

473
00:18:39,508 --> 00:18:41,149
which is, you know, a great correlate of arousal,

474
00:18:41,189 --> 00:18:42,490
you can get arousal as well.

475
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,232
And so pretty much any eye tracker you buy

476
00:18:44,272 --> 00:18:46,233
will be able to measure pupil dilation.

477
00:18:47,034 --> 00:18:49,996
A unique metric and very, very reliable eye tracking

478
00:18:50,016 --> 00:18:51,337
technique is kind of mature now.

479
00:18:51,357 --> 00:18:53,779
It's still very expensive, but the technology is mature.

480
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:56,061
So you get pretty good and pretty robust measurements

481
00:18:56,081 --> 00:18:56,922
of visual attention.

482
00:18:57,871 --> 00:19:02,993
The cons, it's incredibly expensive, the most expensive, probably the most expensive of all the signals at the moment.

483
00:19:03,874 --> 00:19:06,875
You know, I'm talking in the tens of thousands of dollars for an eye tracker.

484
00:19:07,215 --> 00:19:11,797
There are companies that are trying to bring that down by an order of magnitude, you know, in the five grand range.

485
00:19:12,137 --> 00:19:16,439
And then there actually, I know there's an open source project where people are trying to do this with webcams.

486
00:19:16,979 --> 00:19:22,701
I don't think it's there yet, but again, it's nice that people are trying to kind of bring this technology down to, you know, consumer price points.

487
00:19:23,822 --> 00:19:24,782
So, just something to think about.

488
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:29,409
Other cons, it definitely requires a lot of analysis, post-hoc analysis.

489
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:34,412
You can automate stuff and you can write scripts, but if you want to tag various features in the display,

490
00:19:34,432 --> 00:19:39,595
it can require a lot of analysis to do at least the quantification of scan pattern that I was talking about.

491
00:19:39,615 --> 00:19:42,077
That requires a lot of work as well.

492
00:19:42,177 --> 00:19:44,478
So you can get great data out of it, but you have to work for it.

493
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:48,821
And then just one fact to it is that it can be intrusive as well.

494
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:50,082
They've done studies where...

495
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:56,440
You tell people you're tracking their eyes, or you don't, and the people who know their eyes are being tracked, you know, have different eye movements.

496
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,042
Like, they're more deliberate in their eye movements.

497
00:19:59,382 --> 00:20:04,425
So again, as with any kind of measurement technique, you know, we're introducing bias into the equation, unfortunately.

498
00:20:04,685 --> 00:20:10,489
But, you know, the data for the most part is pretty clean, but I didn't want to let you guys think that it was completely bias-free.

499
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:12,250
Um...

500
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,971
Alright, so...

501
00:20:14,951 --> 00:20:16,472
Last one to talk about is EEGs.

502
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,672
So this is measuring electrical potentials of the brain.

503
00:20:19,812 --> 00:20:21,573
EEGs are primarily time-based signals,

504
00:20:21,994 --> 00:20:23,575
so finding out when an event occurs.

505
00:20:24,235 --> 00:20:25,736
But you can put sensors all over the head,

506
00:20:25,996 --> 00:20:27,498
and you get coarse measures of location,

507
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:28,698
which is pretty cool.

508
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:30,860
And I guess what they're primarily

509
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,861
used for, at least in terms of their immediate applicability,

510
00:20:33,262 --> 00:20:34,563
is you can look at the frequency spectrum,

511
00:20:35,023 --> 00:20:37,425
so the frequency kind of bands of electrical potential

512
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:39,927
in the brain and the latency of the spikes.

513
00:20:39,987 --> 00:20:41,848
But if you deconvolve the frequency spectra,

514
00:20:42,368 --> 00:20:44,370
you can get measurements of emotion.

515
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,812
Like there are alpha waves that are kind of low frequency.

516
00:20:47,385 --> 00:20:48,745
that are correlated with relaxation,

517
00:20:48,785 --> 00:20:50,426
and there's beta waves that are correlated with alertness,

518
00:20:50,486 --> 00:20:51,906
and there are delta waves that are correlated

519
00:20:52,266 --> 00:20:54,527
with kind of like focused attention.

520
00:20:55,267 --> 00:20:56,528
So you could get these measurements,

521
00:20:56,868 --> 00:20:59,529
and you can measure engagement in your games, for example,

522
00:20:59,569 --> 00:21:00,729
or detect when a player was engaged,

523
00:21:00,749 --> 00:21:02,410
or detect when a player was relaxed, and so forth.

524
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,611
Just the upper left picture is potential scalplications

525
00:21:07,631 --> 00:21:09,372
like EEG studies, and in the labs,

526
00:21:09,412 --> 00:21:10,572
acquire hundreds of electrodes.

527
00:21:10,752 --> 00:21:12,473
There are consumer grade headsets that are a few hundred

528
00:21:12,513 --> 00:21:12,733
bucks.

529
00:21:13,784 --> 00:21:15,705
that do a pretty good job of measuring emotion.

530
00:21:16,185 --> 00:21:17,565
They use far less sensors than a couple

531
00:21:17,585 --> 00:21:19,206
that only have two sensors on the forehead.

532
00:21:19,226 --> 00:21:22,507
The right graph is just because I like cool looking graphs

533
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:23,927
and it's just kind of showing you how

534
00:21:24,487 --> 00:21:25,848
different regions of the brain can light up

535
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:28,229
at various points in time for different stimuli.

536
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:34,550
So EEGs, positives, you can get arousal out of them,

537
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,151
you can get valence, again, not.

538
00:21:36,501 --> 00:21:39,342
a complete picture, but you can do a pretty good job.

539
00:21:39,362 --> 00:21:41,023
And you can get rudimentary insight into thought.

540
00:21:41,423 --> 00:21:43,724
I do not want you thinking that you can get complex thought

541
00:21:44,964 --> 00:21:47,545
through consumer-grade EEGs at the moment.

542
00:21:47,565 --> 00:21:50,786
We can do some stuff, but the brain is very, very noisy.

543
00:21:50,906 --> 00:21:54,047
And so to actually extract signal from noise

544
00:21:54,087 --> 00:21:55,728
usually requires hundreds of trials

545
00:21:55,828 --> 00:21:57,869
with minimal differences between conditions and so forth.

546
00:21:57,929 --> 00:21:59,469
And so you can get localization.

547
00:21:59,489 --> 00:22:00,450
You can tell when people might think

548
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,350
in about a leftward action versus a rightward action,

549
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,671
or maybe a pushing or pulling action.

550
00:22:04,459 --> 00:22:10,961
But we're not close actually to playing Halo with your head yet.

551
00:22:11,301 --> 00:22:13,622
Maybe in the future, but we're not there yet.

552
00:22:14,362 --> 00:22:20,524
Cons, it's expensive, intrusive, so the data again is not clean.

553
00:22:20,544 --> 00:22:23,264
It can be very noisy and very hard to extract signals sometimes.

554
00:22:23,665 --> 00:22:24,685
And then difficult to validate, right?

555
00:22:24,725 --> 00:22:27,566
Again, you're relying on someone else's product to validate stuff for you.

556
00:22:27,606 --> 00:22:31,767
And again, we're trying to come up with our own solutions to this.

557
00:22:31,787 --> 00:22:32,707
That's a point I'm making.

558
00:22:33,733 --> 00:22:34,494
I guess I want a heart.

559
00:22:34,554 --> 00:22:36,195
Well, I bring up, I guess, just because it's

560
00:22:36,215 --> 00:22:38,996
something to think about is that there

561
00:22:39,056 --> 00:22:41,378
are disagreements about how to quantify

562
00:22:41,838 --> 00:22:43,779
waveforms in the brain or EGs in the brain.

563
00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:46,741
And so it's important to realize that the data you're getting

564
00:22:46,781 --> 00:22:48,582
is dependent upon one person's interpretation of what's

565
00:22:48,602 --> 00:22:51,724
going on, or one company's interpretation of what's

566
00:22:51,764 --> 00:22:52,124
going on.

567
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:57,307
Other techniques, so we have pupil dilation, body temp,

568
00:22:57,327 --> 00:22:57,907
body posture.

569
00:22:59,033 --> 00:23:00,254
Yeah, I'm not going to talk about them.

570
00:23:00,294 --> 00:23:02,696
I will mention that people have actually done studies.

571
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,918
And so if you couple body posture and pupil dilation,

572
00:23:06,198 --> 00:23:08,100
so you could do pupil dilation remotely with an eye tracker.

573
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,361
You could do body posture remotely

574
00:23:09,381 --> 00:23:11,843
with a depth sensing camera like Connect or whatnot.

575
00:23:12,543 --> 00:23:15,245
You can account for about 80% of self-reported frustration

576
00:23:16,286 --> 00:23:18,268
just to those two metrics, two non-intrusive metrics.

577
00:23:18,548 --> 00:23:21,270
So not too shabby in that regard.

578
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,272
There's also lots of stuff we haven't thought about.

579
00:23:23,352 --> 00:23:25,173
Some stuff we have that I guess I'm not talking about.

580
00:23:25,914 --> 00:23:27,955
But this is a partial.

581
00:23:28,523 --> 00:23:29,324
painting of the picture.

582
00:23:29,384 --> 00:23:31,125
There are many more ways you could

583
00:23:31,145 --> 00:23:33,286
be extracting information from the body or from users.

584
00:23:33,346 --> 00:23:35,167
And so these are some of the common ones,

585
00:23:35,187 --> 00:23:36,188
some of the most useful ones.

586
00:23:36,268 --> 00:23:39,770
But it shouldn't feel like I'm constraining

587
00:23:40,691 --> 00:23:43,252
the notion about feedback to the metrics I've mentioned.

588
00:23:45,554 --> 00:23:47,175
All right, so let's get to the good stuff.

589
00:23:48,035 --> 00:23:49,236
So how can we use this data?

590
00:23:50,277 --> 00:23:51,537
We could start with the most basic,

591
00:23:51,577 --> 00:23:53,058
like passive viewing of biofeedback data.

592
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:55,240
I show you your arousal in-game, and I'll

593
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,500
show you a video of that later on.

594
00:23:57,112 --> 00:23:58,572
which actually is pretty cool.

595
00:23:59,172 --> 00:24:00,853
You can think about modifying game experience

596
00:24:00,893 --> 00:24:02,634
based upon a player's internal state,

597
00:24:02,914 --> 00:24:05,055
what a player is feeling at any point in time.

598
00:24:05,075 --> 00:24:07,475
I'll walk you through an experiment we did

599
00:24:07,515 --> 00:24:09,356
where we modified the director in Left 4 Dead,

600
00:24:09,376 --> 00:24:11,637
which is an algorithm that kind of controls

601
00:24:11,657 --> 00:24:12,937
the gameplay experience in Left 4 Dead,

602
00:24:13,238 --> 00:24:14,458
where we added biofeedback to that

603
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:16,539
and tried to create a better experience.

604
00:24:16,979 --> 00:24:19,620
You can think about adapting difficulty in real time.

605
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,221
So if you could detect that a player was frustrated, right?

606
00:24:22,723 --> 00:24:24,043
or that a player was feeling challenged,

607
00:24:24,123 --> 00:24:25,523
or a player was not feeling challenged, right?

608
00:24:25,563 --> 00:24:28,184
You could modify the game in real time to adapt to that.

609
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:30,284
Yeah, it's something to think about.

610
00:24:30,304 --> 00:24:32,324
You could think about detecting when a player was bored,

611
00:24:32,945 --> 00:24:36,105
and figuring out a way to kind of re-engage them.

612
00:24:36,165 --> 00:24:38,065
These sorts of gameplay techniques,

613
00:24:38,105 --> 00:24:40,066
which are not possible with current control schemes,

614
00:24:40,526 --> 00:24:41,246
could be possible.

615
00:24:41,386 --> 00:24:43,206
I mean, I'm not gonna say that we could definitely do them,

616
00:24:43,246 --> 00:24:45,927
but they could be possible with biofeedback devices.

617
00:24:46,967 --> 00:24:49,207
We're really curious about optimal arousal patterns.

618
00:24:49,407 --> 00:24:50,387
We wonder if they exist.

619
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,168
Like, you know, is there a pattern of arousal?

620
00:24:52,953 --> 00:24:54,393
or a pattern of emotion in game,

621
00:24:54,894 --> 00:24:55,854
while someone's playing a game,

622
00:24:56,154 --> 00:24:58,115
that will lead to the most enjoyable experience.

623
00:24:58,155 --> 00:25:00,415
And again, it probably is not the same for all folks,

624
00:25:00,515 --> 00:25:03,456
but just thinking about what would contribute

625
00:25:03,476 --> 00:25:04,717
to an optimal pattern of arousal.

626
00:25:04,757 --> 00:25:06,017
And so with these techniques,

627
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:08,118
you could start trying to attack that question.

628
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:12,159
And say, yeah, it's, I just have three silly examples

629
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:13,840
of what the pattern, it's peaks and valleys,

630
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,000
or maybe it's steadily increasing,

631
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,921
or it has a giant peak and then a valley,

632
00:25:16,961 --> 00:25:17,941
and then tiny peaks,

633
00:25:17,981 --> 00:25:19,722
or maybe it's steadily increasing peaks or valleys.

634
00:25:20,232 --> 00:25:20,672
Who knows?

635
00:25:20,832 --> 00:25:22,173
But just trying to figure out and seeing

636
00:25:22,193 --> 00:25:25,656
if it's possible to figure out if there is a pattern,

637
00:25:25,876 --> 00:25:30,080
at least in various levels or maybe across specific genres,

638
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,642
that would lead to the most enjoyable experience.

639
00:25:32,662 --> 00:25:34,804
We think it's an interesting question and worth attacking.

640
00:25:37,106 --> 00:25:37,846
More applications.

641
00:25:38,086 --> 00:25:39,948
So you can think about actually inputting

642
00:25:40,348 --> 00:25:41,990
physiological or using physiological data

643
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,291
as direct inputs to gameplay.

644
00:25:43,991 --> 00:25:47,154
Just a couple quick examples, like tying health to arousal.

645
00:25:47,214 --> 00:25:48,075
Like if you stay calm.

646
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:50,520
your health decreases gradually.

647
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,442
If you get highly aroused, your health ticks down quicker.

648
00:25:52,462 --> 00:25:54,344
You can think about in-game prompts

649
00:25:54,664 --> 00:25:55,785
that are tied to emotional state.

650
00:25:55,965 --> 00:25:57,707
If someone's engaged, you don't want to distract them.

651
00:25:58,107 --> 00:25:59,608
You minimize pop-ups, for example.

652
00:25:59,648 --> 00:26:01,210
If someone's kind of bored or you

653
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,971
can tell that they're wandering around and lost,

654
00:26:02,991 --> 00:26:05,554
then you could kind of detect that in theory

655
00:26:06,094 --> 00:26:07,715
and add in prompts to kind of help them out.

656
00:26:07,936 --> 00:26:09,697
You can think about NPCs responding dynamically.

657
00:26:09,757 --> 00:26:11,559
It's like, hey, Mike, why are you so sad?

658
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,341
Like if they detected that I was frowning, right?

659
00:26:14,361 --> 00:26:15,422
I mean, you can think about experiences

660
00:26:16,376 --> 00:26:19,778
you know, characters or players in-game are responding to what you're experiencing

661
00:26:19,818 --> 00:26:22,899
at any given point in time, you know, could create a really powerful experience.

662
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,981
Um, and you can think about, you know, requiring, you know,

663
00:26:26,341 --> 00:26:29,403
subjects to remain, or people, players to remain calm, right?

664
00:26:29,483 --> 00:26:32,505
Like, you know, having, you know, or getting really aroused to proceed in-game.

665
00:26:32,545 --> 00:26:34,006
You could imagine a lie detection game,

666
00:26:34,506 --> 00:26:38,128
where to fool your interrogator, you had to maintain a calm, or a low level of arousal.

667
00:26:38,548 --> 00:26:41,550
And, you know, if you, if you got aroused, or you got nervous, um, you know, you'd lose, right?

668
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:43,991
Or you, or they would detect your lie. Um, so things like that.

669
00:26:46,005 --> 00:26:48,126
Again, beyond that, there's lots of stuff we're thinking about.

670
00:26:49,047 --> 00:26:51,088
So you think about actually doing matchmaking

671
00:26:51,348 --> 00:26:52,629
based on physiological profiling.

672
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:55,411
So maybe you don't want to pair a passive player

673
00:26:55,731 --> 00:26:57,152
with a really emotional player.

674
00:26:57,212 --> 00:27:00,114
Maybe that is a worse pairing than a really bad player

675
00:27:00,134 --> 00:27:00,835
with a really good player.

676
00:27:00,855 --> 00:27:02,036
Maybe that leads to a worse experience.

677
00:27:02,076 --> 00:27:04,237
And so maybe if we could pair passive players together

678
00:27:04,337 --> 00:27:06,919
or emotional players together or easily frustrated players

679
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:10,141
together, we could do a better job with matchmaking.

680
00:27:10,361 --> 00:27:11,282
I'm not saying it's possible.

681
00:27:12,272 --> 00:27:16,695
exit is possible. I'm not saying we can prove it, but I'm saying it's something we're thinking about, we think it might be worthwhile.

682
00:27:18,196 --> 00:27:22,939
Along with the passive viewing of your own behavior in game, you think about competitive play.

683
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:27,442
People browsing through a list of matches and trying to figure out what match to watch.

684
00:27:27,662 --> 00:27:31,944
Watching the arousal patterns of really skilled players could be interesting. It could be a way to filter

685
00:27:32,585 --> 00:27:36,547
how you expect a competitive match, or if you're just watching a competitive match in general and just knowing.

686
00:27:37,437 --> 00:27:40,019
if the competitors were feeling aroused or scared

687
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:41,480
or whatnot at any given point in time,

688
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,500
could be pretty interesting.

689
00:27:43,381 --> 00:27:45,122
And then beyond single-player stuff,

690
00:27:45,142 --> 00:27:47,503
we could think about ways to use this in multiplayer.

691
00:27:47,963 --> 00:27:49,144
You could see a spike in your teammate.

692
00:27:49,684 --> 00:27:50,745
You may detect when they're in trouble.

693
00:27:51,485 --> 00:27:53,366
Or maybe if you want to grief the other team,

694
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:54,907
and you can create a spike in arousal,

695
00:27:55,567 --> 00:27:57,608
you can earn points for listening responses

696
00:27:57,628 --> 00:27:58,989
I guess in your opponents.

697
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,310
And then final application.

698
00:28:01,941 --> 00:28:03,562
Again, I'm not really going to talk about playtesting.

699
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:04,663
I think I have one slide on it.

700
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,205
It could be a whole other talk.

701
00:28:06,225 --> 00:28:08,647
This is more about the gameplay side of things.

702
00:28:08,727 --> 00:28:11,449
But we can definitely, there is so much

703
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:13,451
to be gained in terms of quantifying

704
00:28:13,551 --> 00:28:14,392
how a player is feeling.

705
00:28:14,512 --> 00:28:16,414
In playtesting, we want to know what they're doing,

706
00:28:16,454 --> 00:28:18,336
why they're doing it, and how they're doing it,

707
00:28:18,356 --> 00:28:19,577
and how they feel about it.

708
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:21,979
What they're doing is easy, right?

709
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,201
The other two are subject to noise.

710
00:28:24,822 --> 00:28:27,184
And so if you have kind of biofeedback stuff.

711
00:28:28,274 --> 00:28:29,875
In there, we could start making better attempts

712
00:28:29,895 --> 00:28:31,897
at quantifying emotion and getting a better understanding

713
00:28:31,917 --> 00:28:34,118
of how people are feeling as they're playing our games.

714
00:28:37,241 --> 00:28:37,561
All right.

715
00:28:38,161 --> 00:28:41,023
So I'll walk you through three, actually,

716
00:28:41,103 --> 00:28:42,044
main experiments we did.

717
00:28:42,064 --> 00:28:45,186
They're all still ongoing, but I'll walk you through

718
00:28:45,967 --> 00:28:47,888
what they are and why we think they're interesting

719
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:49,930
in terms of using biofeedback.

720
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:52,612
So the first is modifying the director in Left 4 Dead 2.

721
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:55,334
Second is actually using physiological signals

722
00:28:55,454 --> 00:28:57,415
as direct inputs to gameplay in Alien Swarm.

723
00:28:57,833 --> 00:28:59,694
And then I'll talk about playing Portal 2 with your eyes.

724
00:28:59,714 --> 00:29:01,836
So actually using your eyes as controllers.

725
00:29:03,918 --> 00:29:06,240
And then I have a couple of slides on kind of passive

726
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,461
viewing and some multiplayer tests we ran where you could

727
00:29:08,501 --> 00:29:11,084
view physiological signals of your opponents and your

728
00:29:11,104 --> 00:29:11,464
teammates.

729
00:29:11,504 --> 00:29:12,945
And then I have one slide on play testing.

730
00:29:15,227 --> 00:29:15,987
So Leopard Ed.

731
00:29:18,109 --> 00:29:22,052
So in Leopard Ed and Leopard 2, the player gets a different

732
00:29:22,072 --> 00:29:23,674
experience each time they play.

733
00:29:23,774 --> 00:29:26,716
And the way this works is we have a kind of a system called

734
00:29:26,736 --> 00:29:27,217
the director that.

735
00:29:27,587 --> 00:29:32,269
creates a dynamic experience, I guess, throughout gameplay.

736
00:29:32,669 --> 00:29:34,750
And what it does is it modifies enemy spawns,

737
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:37,491
where health and weapon are placed, which boss monsters

738
00:29:37,531 --> 00:29:38,331
occur, and so forth.

739
00:29:38,751 --> 00:29:41,052
And it does this based upon an estimated arousal level.

740
00:29:41,653 --> 00:29:43,953
So the director has an estimated arousal level in mind.

741
00:29:43,994 --> 00:29:45,674
And it says, yeah, they're highly aroused.

742
00:29:46,014 --> 00:29:48,215
I'm going to let them kind of drop down for a little bit

743
00:29:48,295 --> 00:29:48,916
and not bug them.

744
00:29:49,296 --> 00:29:51,957
Or they're not aroused based on my estimation of it.

745
00:29:52,317 --> 00:29:54,998
I'm going to give them a smoker to attack or a hunter to attack

746
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:57,139
or I'll have a mob spawn and go after them.

747
00:29:59,603 --> 00:30:01,884
And so what we wanted to know was,

748
00:30:01,944 --> 00:30:04,244
if you replace this estimated arousal level

749
00:30:05,004 --> 00:30:07,025
with actual physiological arousal from the player,

750
00:30:07,345 --> 00:30:08,885
can you create a more enjoyable experience?

751
00:30:09,605 --> 00:30:11,566
And then beyond that, going back to what I was talking about

752
00:30:11,606 --> 00:30:13,706
earlier, is can we determine optimal arousal patterns

753
00:30:14,366 --> 00:30:14,946
in this regard?

754
00:30:17,327 --> 00:30:19,367
So really quickly, just going over how the director works,

755
00:30:19,767 --> 00:30:21,388
you have survivor intensity as a single value.

756
00:30:22,068 --> 00:30:24,248
It's increased in response to in-game trauma.

757
00:30:24,629 --> 00:30:27,069
So you get attacked, you lose health.

758
00:30:28,311 --> 00:30:30,192
You kill an enemy that's close to you, for example,

759
00:30:30,332 --> 00:30:31,413
intensity increases.

760
00:30:32,013 --> 00:30:33,614
Intensity decays to zero over time.

761
00:30:33,634 --> 00:30:36,176
I think it's, I don't know, 30 seconds to a minute,

762
00:30:36,196 --> 00:30:38,697
depending on various factors.

763
00:30:39,017 --> 00:30:40,338
And the goal of the director was to create

764
00:30:40,378 --> 00:30:42,859
kind of peaks and valleys in this estimated arousal level.

765
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,581
So you can look at the graph here.

766
00:30:45,601 --> 00:30:47,101
The middle line is the most important,

767
00:30:47,141 --> 00:30:47,842
where it says survive.

768
00:30:49,302 --> 00:30:49,543
Hi.

769
00:30:51,644 --> 00:30:52,664
I was actually just wanting to know,

770
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,646
did you use experienced gameplay players for your tests?

771
00:30:56,251 --> 00:30:58,192
Yeah, so it actually varies.

772
00:30:58,752 --> 00:31:00,552
So we did, for the Left 4 Dead 2 study,

773
00:31:00,573 --> 00:31:03,133
we had these are all not Valve employees,

774
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:05,154
but external play testers, but people who had played Left 4

775
00:31:05,454 --> 00:31:07,615
Dead 2 before, who had come into the lab.

776
00:31:08,255 --> 00:31:09,396
So yeah, but the question, what you

777
00:31:09,416 --> 00:31:10,696
could do with novel gameplay players

778
00:31:10,716 --> 00:31:11,756
and are those patterns of analysis

779
00:31:11,777 --> 00:31:12,377
going to be different?

780
00:31:12,517 --> 00:31:12,697
Yeah.

781
00:31:12,777 --> 00:31:13,197
Absolutely.

782
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:13,617
Yeah.

783
00:31:13,637 --> 00:31:13,757
Yeah.

784
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:14,638
Yeah.

785
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:17,278
Hi.

786
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,700
I actually work on very similar problems with eye tracking.

787
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,281
With our play testing, we've actually

788
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:25,862
found that.

789
00:31:26,923 --> 00:31:32,546
uh, that when people have to focus on the screen for a long period of time, they start to get

790
00:31:32,607 --> 00:31:36,389
headaches and we get problems with eye strain after a long, like, more than 15 minutes of

791
00:31:36,429 --> 00:31:43,453
gameplay. So I'm kind of curious if you tested beyond 15 minutes or what kind of problems you

792
00:31:43,473 --> 00:31:49,317
may have run into? So the question was, um, is whether or not we can use eye trackers for

793
00:31:49,337 --> 00:31:52,979
longer than 15 minutes, um, because there is potential for eye strain. Um, yeah, so we've

794
00:31:53,059 --> 00:31:54,100
tested people for an hour and a half.

795
00:31:54,722 --> 00:31:58,546
Um, you know, people can, the eye tracker we use is pretty robust so people can look away from the screen.

796
00:31:59,106 --> 00:32:01,569
Um, you know, they can stand up and sit down, um, if they want.

797
00:32:01,589 --> 00:32:06,013
So we've had, you know, hour and a half long, two hour play testing sessions and haven't had really any complaints of eye strain.

798
00:32:06,594 --> 00:32:13,701
Um, you know, we kind of, you know, we have, I guess the, you know, the bounding box in terms of what the eye tracker can detect lets you kind of move your head around, you don't need to stay in the same position.

799
00:32:14,162 --> 00:32:15,283
Um, so we've been okay in that regard.

800
00:32:19,357 --> 00:32:23,421
Can you force arousal in the human player

801
00:32:23,561 --> 00:32:26,243
by giving them signals that their in-game character is

802
00:32:26,283 --> 00:32:27,144
getting highly aroused?

803
00:32:27,504 --> 00:32:29,526
Like if, I don't know, the character's left for dead,

804
00:32:29,546 --> 00:32:32,168
start breathing heavily, or their vision gets blurry,

805
00:32:32,348 --> 00:32:33,810
will that force arousal in the player?

806
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:35,771
Yeah, so the question was, can you

807
00:32:36,232 --> 00:32:39,735
kind of induce arousal or various responses in the player

808
00:32:39,795 --> 00:32:42,457
by having in-game avatars mimic those same responses?

809
00:32:43,498 --> 00:32:44,718
And so absolutely.

810
00:32:45,158 --> 00:32:47,259
We have neurons in the brain called mirror neurons

811
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:51,100
that kind of fire when you see an action being performed.

812
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,221
And so it actually is kind of analogous to you

813
00:32:53,241 --> 00:32:54,101
performing the action yourself.

814
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:55,621
If I see someone swinging a baseball bat,

815
00:32:55,921 --> 00:32:58,142
the same neurons that would fire when

816
00:32:58,202 --> 00:32:59,923
I was swinging a baseball bat fire when I actually

817
00:32:59,963 --> 00:33:01,243
see that process occurring.

818
00:33:01,543 --> 00:33:03,184
And so you get those kinds of triggers

819
00:33:03,204 --> 00:33:06,644
where if you see your in-game avatar panting heavily,

820
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:08,305
for example, absolutely would you

821
00:33:08,325 --> 00:33:10,285
see a change in respiration rate.

822
00:33:10,326 --> 00:33:10,726
It may not be.

823
00:33:12,313 --> 00:33:14,853
a large change, but absolutely will players kind of be

824
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:16,194
affected by what they see on screen.

825
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:22,255
Hey, so the Alien Swarm testers, how did that work out for them?

826
00:33:23,075 --> 00:33:23,616
Which one, sorry?

827
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,036
The Alien Swarm testers?

828
00:33:25,076 --> 00:33:25,176
Yeah.

829
00:33:25,216 --> 00:33:26,076
Did they actually succeed?

830
00:33:26,656 --> 00:33:26,856
Yes.

831
00:33:27,076 --> 00:33:28,777
So the question was, did the Alien Swarm playtesters

832
00:33:28,837 --> 00:33:29,477
actually succeed?

833
00:33:29,537 --> 00:33:31,837
And yeah, so I showed you a small snippet just

834
00:33:31,857 --> 00:33:33,318
because I was pressed for time.

835
00:33:33,418 --> 00:33:36,038
But yeah, the Alien Swarm, yeah, so I think.

836
00:33:37,358 --> 00:33:39,019
about 60% of people made it through.

837
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:40,179
And again, this is our algorithm, right?

838
00:33:40,199 --> 00:33:42,020
So we're tweaking it so we can make it harder or easier.

839
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,181
But yeah, about 60% of people made it through so far.

840
00:33:44,701 --> 00:33:45,921
So did they have access?

841
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,482
Did they see the time left?

842
00:33:47,622 --> 00:33:49,143
And did they see the color change as well?

843
00:33:49,483 --> 00:33:51,524
Yeah, so we've done it both ways.

844
00:33:51,544 --> 00:33:52,484
They always see the time left.

845
00:33:52,504 --> 00:33:54,645
They always see the color shift from green to yellow

846
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:55,825
to red or back or whatever.

847
00:33:56,546 --> 00:33:58,387
We've done studies where we show them the arousal and not.

848
00:33:58,847 --> 00:34:00,547
When we showed them the arousal, they got more frustrated

849
00:34:00,567 --> 00:34:02,068
because they didn't understand why the timer

850
00:34:02,188 --> 00:34:03,128
was speeding up sometimes.

851
00:34:03,589 --> 00:34:04,429
When they didn't see the arousal,

852
00:34:04,449 --> 00:34:06,150
they were more likely to kind of be cool with it.

853
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:07,958
OK, cool, thanks.

854
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:14,102
Hi, I was wondering if you were able to track flow and mastery

855
00:34:14,222 --> 00:34:15,803
from players.

856
00:34:15,943 --> 00:34:17,984
I mean, if you master player, it would

857
00:34:18,024 --> 00:34:19,545
be calm during the gameplay.

858
00:34:19,685 --> 00:34:24,588
And if you were able to design for a flow experience.

859
00:34:25,249 --> 00:34:28,871
So the question was, did we track flow and mastery

860
00:34:28,951 --> 00:34:29,531
of players?

861
00:34:29,591 --> 00:34:31,412
Or players who are really good or experts at the game,

862
00:34:31,893 --> 00:34:33,533
did we look at differences between them?

863
00:34:33,574 --> 00:34:35,415
And I'm assuming people who are not

864
00:34:35,455 --> 00:34:36,575
masters or novices or whatnot.

865
00:34:37,681 --> 00:34:40,362
We've done some kind of comparisons of novices and experts.

866
00:34:40,382 --> 00:34:41,202
We haven't checked flow.

867
00:34:42,423 --> 00:34:44,824
That can be a little tricky to operationalize sometimes.

868
00:34:45,564 --> 00:34:47,445
But no, we haven't done anything systematic in that regard.

869
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:49,766
We are really curious in novice expert differences

870
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:51,867
and how that correlates to patterns of arousal,

871
00:34:51,928 --> 00:34:53,088
patterns of physiological signal.

872
00:34:53,728 --> 00:34:56,009
But I guess it's stuff I didn't plan to talk about

873
00:34:56,029 --> 00:34:57,430
and can't really talk about at the present time.

874
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:02,853
Okay, well, yeah, thank you guys very much.

875
00:35:03,233 --> 00:35:04,173
Oh, sorry, I guess one more question.

876
00:35:08,572 --> 00:35:11,854
Hi, I teach at Arizona State University.

877
00:35:11,934 --> 00:35:15,296
I'm game design, but I'm doing a collaboration with bio design.

878
00:35:16,017 --> 00:35:18,839
And I was wondering if you would be interested in working,

879
00:35:18,899 --> 00:35:22,121
perhaps, with people who are doing physical probes

880
00:35:22,381 --> 00:35:26,283
into the body, and perhaps expand your research that way

881
00:35:26,323 --> 00:35:27,304
and work with academia?

882
00:35:27,364 --> 00:35:30,386
Or are you all commercially-oriented,

883
00:35:30,486 --> 00:35:32,327
and you want to stay in that world?

884
00:35:33,068 --> 00:35:36,430
Was the question, what devices are we using,

885
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,210
and are we like?

886
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,541
to using devices that are actually attached to the body?

887
00:35:39,561 --> 00:35:40,141
Is that the question?

888
00:35:40,161 --> 00:35:40,321
Sorry.

889
00:35:40,361 --> 00:35:40,542
Yeah.

890
00:35:41,022 --> 00:35:43,103
I can see how our research might complement each other.

891
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,143
But I come from academia, and there's

892
00:35:45,203 --> 00:35:50,045
no commercial application that we're going for other than,

893
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:54,467
well, the biodesign guys are going for designing prosthetics.

894
00:35:55,507 --> 00:35:55,928
Right.

895
00:35:56,568 --> 00:35:59,889
So I was wondering, there's an intersection there.

896
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:03,351
Would you be interested in perhaps working with us?

897
00:36:03,971 --> 00:36:04,831
Oh, sure.

898
00:36:04,851 --> 00:36:05,471
I mean, well, someone's.

899
00:36:05,491 --> 00:36:05,571
Yeah.

900
00:36:06,406 --> 00:36:08,007
Oh, I mean, of course, yeah.

901
00:36:08,027 --> 00:36:09,427
We're definitely interested in seeing

902
00:36:09,447 --> 00:36:10,168
what other people are doing.

903
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:11,308
I mean, the whole point of this talk

904
00:36:11,348 --> 00:36:13,109
was to say, hey, we think this is really cool,

905
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,430
and we definitely want to encourage more people

906
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:17,631
to be thinking about both how to improve the techniques we have

907
00:36:17,651 --> 00:36:18,952
and then how they could be used in gameplay,

908
00:36:18,972 --> 00:36:22,213
so both the commercial and the basic and applied concerns

909
00:36:22,254 --> 00:36:22,794
of this research.

910
00:36:22,814 --> 00:36:24,835
So definitely we can talk and see

911
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:26,956
if we can see if there's potential down the line

912
00:36:27,016 --> 00:36:28,376
for a collaboration and whatnot.

913
00:36:28,757 --> 00:36:29,577
So I'll send you an email?

914
00:36:29,857 --> 00:36:30,517
Sure, that's fine.

915
00:36:31,578 --> 00:36:31,998
Thanks, guys.

916
00:36:32,018 --> 00:36:32,638
Appreciate it.
