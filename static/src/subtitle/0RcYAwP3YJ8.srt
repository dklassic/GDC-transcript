1
00:00:05,654 --> 00:00:06,035
Good?

2
00:00:07,358 --> 00:00:09,121
Hey guys, how's everyone doing today?

3
00:00:09,141 --> 00:00:16,096
All right, I want to hear way more energy than that. All right, good morning everybody.

4
00:00:19,858 --> 00:00:26,399
Oh, you can do better than that. Come on. I know it's Friday, but really.

5
00:00:26,419 --> 00:00:28,780
All right. Everybody's home.

6
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,621
Okay. Welcome. Just to make sure you're in the right talk, which I know you guys are,

7
00:00:34,161 --> 00:00:37,482
it's killer portfolio or killer, wait.

8
00:00:37,982 --> 00:00:39,343
Killer portfolio, killer.

9
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:41,484
It's up there.

10
00:00:42,484 --> 00:00:43,045
It's that.

11
00:00:44,005 --> 00:00:48,668
If everybody can actually turn off your cell phones, that would be awesome.

12
00:00:48,688 --> 00:00:49,849
And let's begin.

13
00:00:49,869 --> 00:00:56,254
My name is Allison Kelly and I'm a consultant to top tier gaming companies.

14
00:00:57,112 --> 00:00:58,353
And we'll start from Sean.

15
00:00:58,693 --> 00:01:01,255
And also if you could, Sean, start with what is your number

16
00:01:01,435 --> 00:01:03,677
one pet peeve that you see with portfolios?

17
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:05,358
Wow.

18
00:01:05,838 --> 00:01:07,979
All right, well, I'll start with my name.

19
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,040
Sean Robertson.

20
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,723
I was animation director on Bioshock Infinite, lead

21
00:01:12,763 --> 00:01:13,843
animator on Bioshock.

22
00:01:13,863 --> 00:01:17,266
I'm currently art director on Ken Levine's current project,

23
00:01:17,326 --> 00:01:21,709
the negative Lego thing that he had talked about at GDC a

24
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:22,449
couple years ago.

25
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,592
biggest pet peeve for me on portfolios is lack of

26
00:01:27,632 --> 00:01:31,534
presentation, hiding what could potentially be really good art

27
00:01:31,694 --> 00:01:37,877
behind really bad presentation of that art. I'm Gavin Goulden,

28
00:01:37,917 --> 00:01:40,978
I'm the lead character artist for insomniac games. I just

29
00:01:40,998 --> 00:01:44,420
worked on sunset overdrive. We're working on ratchet and

30
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,142
clank, edge of nowhere. Prior to that I was with Sean working on

31
00:01:48,162 --> 00:01:48,942
Bioshock infinite.

32
00:01:50,158 --> 00:01:51,739
You want my pet peeve too?

33
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,939
Your pet peeve, please.

34
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,220
I have so many though.

35
00:01:56,961 --> 00:02:01,343
I would say having a game art portfolio with no game art in it.

36
00:02:01,543 --> 00:02:08,466
Basically just having a lot of really nice ZBrush sculpts but no technical pieces in a game engine.

37
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,207
No game art, no textures.

38
00:02:10,447 --> 00:02:12,288
Just pretty sculpts.

39
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:19,834
All right. I'm Greg Furch. I'm an art director of Fraxxas. My

40
00:02:19,894 --> 00:02:25,718
most recent stuff was X-com 2 and X-com Enemy Unknown. My

41
00:02:26,378 --> 00:02:31,342
biggest, I'm like Gavin. I got so many. So like, I guess the

42
00:02:31,362 --> 00:02:35,405
biggest thing is, is when I see a portfolio that has stuff that

43
00:02:35,465 --> 00:02:38,126
potentially looks good, but it's not shown in a way that I can

44
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:38,847
actually see it.

45
00:02:41,188 --> 00:02:45,628
example if you have an environment piece, if you just

46
00:02:45,668 --> 00:02:48,709
give me a screen shot and I have no idea what anybody did or

47
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:53,190
what's yours or being able to break it out, it kind of makes

48
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,910
it a little confusing to understand what's actually

49
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,031
happening and your thought process is kind of my biggest

50
00:02:59,071 --> 00:03:04,772
thing. My name is Steve Scott. I work at bungee up in Seattle.

51
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:06,192
I'm the special effects art lead.

52
00:03:07,695 --> 00:03:09,956
Our most recent title was Destiny of the Taken King.

53
00:03:11,418 --> 00:03:19,044
My biggest pet peeve for looking at portfolios is that I do not receive nearly enough FX portfolios.

54
00:03:19,484 --> 00:03:20,365
They're very scarce.

55
00:03:22,807 --> 00:03:23,808
I'm Wyeth Johnson.

56
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,049
I've been at Epic Games for 10 years now.

57
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:32,194
I've held a number of different roles, art lead, art director, technical art lead.

58
00:03:32,214 --> 00:03:34,496
I think my biggest pet peeve is probably...

59
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:39,833
when I like something from somebody's but I can't do what I

60
00:03:39,893 --> 00:03:43,516
want with it. So a good example would be a flash portfolio that

61
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,738
I can't just right click, save as, put it in a folder,

62
00:03:45,778 --> 00:03:48,280
somebody I want to look at, somebody maybe I'm interested in

63
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,804
but they're not quite ready and I want to follow up. Difficulties

64
00:03:53,004 --> 00:03:57,007
accessing the content on your site drives me nuts. I want to

65
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:57,868
be able to right click.

66
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:02,951
images, put them where I want them, copy out your information,

67
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:06,613
get a really quick PDF of your resume, all that kind of stuff,

68
00:04:06,693 --> 00:04:09,014
put it right there in my face and let me do what I want with

69
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:15,157
the stuff on your site. Greg, is it true that AAA companies don't

70
00:04:15,457 --> 00:04:17,538
hire recent grads and if so, why?

71
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:23,760
I don't know that that really is something that's locked solid.

72
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,183
I think it's different for a studio you go to.

73
00:04:26,844 --> 00:04:32,612
But the biggest thing is a lot of times I think people who are entering the industry

74
00:04:32,632 --> 00:04:36,476
get turned off by the, you know, we want five years experience or three years experience.

75
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:43,935
You know the bottom line honestly, I mean that does matter but all that matters is your work like the first thing I do

76
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:50,218
When I get a link is I look at your work the second thing I do is I look at your work

77
00:04:51,018 --> 00:04:56,441
The third thing I do is I may look at your name and your resume so like if the work is good. I

78
00:04:58,302 --> 00:05:01,045
I'm not going to know that you have five years experience

79
00:05:01,085 --> 00:05:03,306
or three years experience or a year of experience or none

80
00:05:04,107 --> 00:05:06,449
until I actually get to your resume.

81
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,450
So the portfolio is all that matters.

82
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,371
All that matters is the work.

83
00:05:10,179 --> 00:05:13,562
And so I've seen people that are coming out of school that

84
00:05:13,702 --> 00:05:16,745
perform like somebody who's got three or five years

85
00:05:16,765 --> 00:05:20,889
experience. It just doesn't matter. I've seen it reverse.

86
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:23,131
You know, guys who have multiple years experience and it

87
00:05:23,271 --> 00:05:28,755
doesn't look like they have that years experience. So don't get

88
00:05:28,816 --> 00:05:31,418
caught up on those things because, again, you can't

89
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:35,401
control that stuff. You control your work. And that's honestly

90
00:05:35,441 --> 00:05:36,302
the artwork is all that matters.

91
00:05:37,352 --> 00:05:42,014
Or would you even say a lot of students get hung up on writing these big resumes that

92
00:05:42,054 --> 00:05:43,715
worked at a movie theater.

93
00:05:43,895 --> 00:05:47,777
In the end, like you said, you don't care about the content on the resume.

94
00:05:47,977 --> 00:05:48,897
It's all about your work.

95
00:05:49,188 --> 00:05:53,009
Well, I mean the content needs to be relevant, right? So like, you know, like

96
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,750
It should be the things that you've done that that would have

97
00:05:57,231 --> 00:06:00,012
an interest to the person hiring you no matter

98
00:06:00,852 --> 00:06:04,494
Whether you're looking for a game job or any other job, but but uh, yeah

99
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:09,636
It should be it should be more relevant and it matters but that's again. That's like for me. That's the third tier

100
00:06:10,196 --> 00:06:13,137
I don't know what your gender is or nationality is or

101
00:06:13,637 --> 00:06:14,057
I don't care.

102
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:17,779
You can be purple as long as you can help my game.

103
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:18,739
That's all that matters.

104
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:23,621
And so, yeah, it's, you know, just focus on the thing that matters.

105
00:06:24,602 --> 00:06:25,982
Make sure your resume is clean, though.

106
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:33,755
A lot of students also seem to focus on the tools heavily, which none of us care at all about. I

107
00:06:34,455 --> 00:06:39,439
will teach you any tool in three months. I don't care if you're maxed like the back of your hand

108
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:44,863
and I'm weak in Maya and stressing about my Photoshop thing. Do not care. It's only about the

109
00:06:44,903 --> 00:06:48,266
finished product, the stuff that's in the portfolio that's game art, just like Gavin said.

110
00:06:48,706 --> 00:06:52,789
Pretty sculpts are pretty much meaningless. But if you have a great portfolio that has really

111
00:06:52,809 --> 00:06:55,251
good game art in it, I do not care what tools you know.

112
00:06:55,551 --> 00:06:58,892
Put them in there just in case we're kind of curious what we might be dealing with,

113
00:06:58,972 --> 00:07:03,172
but it shouldn't be half your portfolio is, oh, I'm really good at Excel.

114
00:07:05,373 --> 00:07:06,113
None of us care.

115
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:11,154
Why, this actually brings me to a topic that you always are drilling down.

116
00:07:11,314 --> 00:07:15,155
It's all about quality, not quantity in portfolios.

117
00:07:15,195 --> 00:07:16,055
So talk to me about it.

118
00:07:16,655 --> 00:07:18,335
Oh, it's crazy important.

119
00:07:18,996 --> 00:07:22,596
And actually, a better way to couch that conversation, I think, is...

120
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,558
you're only as strong as the weakest thing

121
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:29,400
in your portfolio.

122
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,963
The reason we always say quality over quantity

123
00:07:33,303 --> 00:07:35,185
is because what happens is people end up

124
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:38,308
hiding their weaknesses at the end of a strong portfolio.

125
00:07:38,348 --> 00:07:39,408
We see it all the time.

126
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,591
They kind of arc from an amazingly good introductory piece

127
00:07:43,012 --> 00:07:44,153
and it tapers down.

128
00:07:44,693 --> 00:07:48,575
And what we're always gonna do is just flip to the last page first and look at what we think

129
00:07:48,976 --> 00:07:53,178
Mentally you believe is the weakest thing on your portfolio because you're gonna hide it you're gonna well

130
00:07:53,218 --> 00:07:55,179
Maybe they won't make it to the end trust me

131
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:01,523
We're gonna look at the last piece first and you're all you know what happens is is we question your quality bar

132
00:08:01,683 --> 00:08:03,024
We question your taste level

133
00:08:03,945 --> 00:08:06,006
because if you have a really, really strong piece, maybe that

134
00:08:06,046 --> 00:08:08,848
was one that you worked on for a long time or you vetted with

135
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,670
the community, maybe you got feedback from your peers. But

136
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,011
maybe you went off into the corner just to fill your

137
00:08:14,031 --> 00:08:16,853
portfolio with more stuff and there's some weak stuff in there

138
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:20,175
that you weren't able to edit out, you couldn't see it for

139
00:08:20,215 --> 00:08:24,478
yourself. And so you always have to be editing your portfolio

140
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:27,180
and constantly culling stuff that's weak so that we're only

141
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,361
seeing the strongest thing.

142
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:36,405
I'll second that. I think the weakest part of your portfolio is going to leave the lasting impression.

143
00:08:36,826 --> 00:08:39,768
This may be a dumb metaphor, but think about a nice meal.

144
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,490
Somebody brings you a nice steak meal.

145
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:46,575
It's got potatoes and a nice cooked steak, and then there's a fly on top of that.

146
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,458
And you're going to focus on the fly. You're not going to focus on the steak.

147
00:08:50,499 --> 00:08:51,640
Like I said, not a perfect metaphor.

148
00:08:53,537 --> 00:08:56,198
I think pulling back and pulling away,

149
00:08:56,238 --> 00:08:58,839
like rather than showing 15 pieces that are, you know,

150
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,401
10 good and five mediocre, leave the mediocre ones out.

151
00:09:03,302 --> 00:09:06,043
Let us be interested in what else you have

152
00:09:06,123 --> 00:09:07,504
rather than showing everything up front.

153
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:12,007
It's about a story of the artwork that you're creating

154
00:09:12,047 --> 00:09:14,508
and leave us wanting, you know, the curiosity,

155
00:09:14,548 --> 00:09:16,169
like, oh, what else does this person have?

156
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:17,510
I'd like to see more, rather than,

157
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,111
oh, they put all this like really bad stuff in,

158
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:22,332
so I kind of get a sense where this is going.

159
00:09:22,637 --> 00:09:25,439
We've hired junior environment artists that had two pieces in

160
00:09:25,479 --> 00:09:28,981
their portfolio. They had two environments, three images each

161
00:09:29,181 --> 00:09:35,605
and they got hired. So Steve, how important is my general

162
00:09:35,646 --> 00:09:38,968
presentation and what can a person do to improve upon it?

163
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:44,750
it's mostly important. As these guys will tell you, it's the

164
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:49,652
content that we're going to be looking at. But the presentation

165
00:09:50,232 --> 00:09:55,154
is going to impact our perception of that quality. Well,

166
00:09:55,254 --> 00:09:59,416
imagine a game with a really bad UI and a really bad

167
00:10:00,117 --> 00:10:03,998
introductory experience, but really good game play. It's hard

168
00:10:04,018 --> 00:10:07,300
to get into that and to find that quality, right? Portfolios

169
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,041
are the same way. So if you're looking at a game and you're

170
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:16,315
why you mentioned a flash presentation that you can't right click and save on those assets.

171
00:10:19,156 --> 00:10:24,637
It's going to be really challenging for us to be able to drill down and really consider

172
00:10:24,677 --> 00:10:31,560
that work if we can't access it. In terms of improving, well...

173
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:32,900
Make it work.

174
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:41,737
Make it work. Test it out on your friends. Have them look at it on their browsers or different formats.

175
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:44,839
Do you guys have any other ideas for how to improve that?

176
00:10:44,939 --> 00:10:47,841
Well, I will say a Tumblr blog is not a portfolio.

177
00:10:49,301 --> 00:10:54,965
That's such a common thing where people are posting their work and it's kind of timeline based and it almost feels stream of consciousness.

178
00:10:55,826 --> 00:10:58,248
I don't see, you know, the first thing that any of us see

179
00:10:58,288 --> 00:11:00,650
should be your absolute greatest thing you've ever done.

180
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:03,513
And a Tumblr blog is the exact opposite of that, right?

181
00:11:03,553 --> 00:11:05,855
Where it's just a timeline of things that are happening.

182
00:11:06,215 --> 00:11:06,916
I'm interested in that.

183
00:11:06,976 --> 00:11:09,258
Maybe put that in your resume so I could scroll through it.

184
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:12,881
Although, honestly, that's a pretty bad presentation anyway.

185
00:11:13,282 --> 00:11:15,063
But that would be another thing I think is, you know,

186
00:11:15,544 --> 00:11:18,086
you need a dedicated portfolio, right?

187
00:11:18,126 --> 00:11:21,129
That deliberately shows us what you're best at.

188
00:11:23,168 --> 00:11:25,828
I want to chime in with one more thing in terms of presentation.

189
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:36,010
Your images are important, your reel is important, but a good quality presentation without spelling

190
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:42,531
errors, with reasonable formatting, even if it's simple, shows us that you have the attention

191
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:48,292
to detail that it takes to not just bring your art skills to bear, but complete a project

192
00:11:48,372 --> 00:11:49,092
and close it out.

193
00:11:50,073 --> 00:11:51,653
So it's pretty important.

194
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:56,795
I mean a great example is in the past I know we've had students who go in for their portfolio

195
00:11:56,815 --> 00:12:01,738
reviews with one of these guys and it's their presentation is not loaded, it's not ready

196
00:12:01,778 --> 00:12:03,279
to go or it breaks.

197
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,620
Fair enough.

198
00:12:07,342 --> 00:12:10,804
Ultimately we're all artists and we have to present our work.

199
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:16,555
and ultimately all we're doing at a game studio is presenting our work to people who are paying for the game.

200
00:12:17,816 --> 00:12:21,597
And every day that's something that we're conscious about, that we have to present our work to you.

201
00:12:21,697 --> 00:12:28,180
So when we're looking at someone who wants to be on our art team, we want to know that they have an eye for presentation,

202
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,762
because that's only going to help us not just make a pretty model to put into a level, but how do you present that model,

203
00:12:33,782 --> 00:12:38,143
how do you present that UI, and make it appealing and make people want to get drawn into your game.

204
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:45,960
And Sean, is it acceptable to show your own interpretation on a company's IP or should

205
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,181
you completely create your own?

206
00:12:47,722 --> 00:12:50,566
I think it's absolutely fine to do that.

207
00:12:51,267 --> 00:12:53,029
One anecdote I have is that

208
00:12:54,056 --> 00:12:59,537
A woman named Claire Hummel had done a bunch of Disney princesses, historical Disney princesses.

209
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:04,058
We were struggling to find a look for Elizabeth at the time.

210
00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:10,540
We saw her artwork floating around and we contacted her and she ended up designing the

211
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:15,921
student Elizabeth, the one with the white shirt and the blue skirt and the two lutesses,

212
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:21,842
the two red hair, because on merit of us being interested in her, because she had done some

213
00:13:22,022 --> 00:13:22,623
Disney stuff.

214
00:13:24,163 --> 00:13:26,905
it wasn't the only thing that she did that got us interested

215
00:13:26,945 --> 00:13:29,667
in her and we saw her entire portfolio and saw that she's a

216
00:13:29,707 --> 00:13:31,789
really, really good artist and that we really wanted to work

217
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:35,712
with her. But that initial interest level was because she

218
00:13:35,752 --> 00:13:39,395
had done something that kind of was making its way around the

219
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:43,458
internet. And we do get a lot of submissions from people that do

220
00:13:43,478 --> 00:13:47,240
Bioshock stuff. The rare occasion, and this is really

221
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,223
rare, it's not common, but we had one guy do a poster that

222
00:13:50,243 --> 00:13:50,663
was so...

223
00:13:51,504 --> 00:13:57,407
damn good that we ended up putting it in the DLC because it looked like it was you know we paid him for it we

224
00:13:57,547 --> 00:14:00,589
Wrote up a contract. We you know we got the rights to put it in the game

225
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,651
But that was unsolicited piece of fan art

226
00:14:05,092 --> 00:14:10,375
So I think normally it's okay to do that stuff, but you got to have other things to back it up. It can't just all be

227
00:14:11,396 --> 00:14:16,359
Copying other people's work or doing your own your own thing on other people's work. I think it probably has to be

228
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:21,262
really good to, because you're basically submitting work to a

229
00:14:21,322 --> 00:14:23,964
company that has been staring at this work for like three years.

230
00:14:24,425 --> 00:14:28,467
So if you want your work to get scrutinized, I think it has to

231
00:14:28,507 --> 00:14:31,910
be good enough to hold up to that kind of judging.

232
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:42,403
When should a portfolio be a real and when should it be a still?

233
00:14:42,483 --> 00:14:45,964
Anything that's animation based is a demo real.

234
00:14:45,984 --> 00:14:50,105
When you're talking about actual traditional animation, we have to see it in motion.

235
00:14:50,205 --> 00:14:53,246
The other key part of that is visual effects.

236
00:14:53,686 --> 00:14:56,126
If you're an effects artist, we have to see your effects in motion.

237
00:14:56,727 --> 00:14:59,168
that doesn't mean stills aren't all so interesting

238
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:00,990
in those avenues, because a lot of times,

239
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,991
when you think of traditional animation

240
00:15:03,031 --> 00:15:04,172
or you think of effects animation,

241
00:15:04,512 --> 00:15:06,153
you're actually thinking about the different states

242
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,915
that those things travel through

243
00:15:07,995 --> 00:15:10,216
over the course of how they animate and how they resolve.

244
00:15:10,637 --> 00:15:12,958
And so thinking about it from kind of pose to pose,

245
00:15:13,238 --> 00:15:15,500
either as an explosion or as a traditional animation,

246
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,341
like character animation.

247
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:20,084
showing that progression and thought process is nice. But

248
00:15:20,104 --> 00:15:23,808
for the most part those need to be video reels. For my money as

249
00:15:23,848 --> 00:15:27,532
well, and I generally talk to these guys about this, also

250
00:15:29,114 --> 00:15:29,955
environment work.

251
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:34,911
We often get environment reels. I hate that. I want to see

252
00:15:35,011 --> 00:15:37,671
really great still images of the environments that you've

253
00:15:37,711 --> 00:15:41,232
created. You can include a video fly through as well. But to me

254
00:15:41,272 --> 00:15:43,513
the primary way to see the environments that people are

255
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:48,554
making is through still imagery. Because there's this ability to

256
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,555
see every little detail, to see the overall sense of aesthetic.

257
00:15:51,595 --> 00:15:54,515
It's not blurry. There's not motion blur and camera artifacts

258
00:15:54,555 --> 00:15:57,456
kind of hiding things. So that's one of the things that may or

259
00:15:57,496 --> 00:15:59,196
may not be a little controversial but I feel like

260
00:15:59,236 --> 00:16:00,437
that's a crucial component.

261
00:16:02,037 --> 00:16:08,101
Great. Gavin, when should my portfolio be as broad or should

262
00:16:08,141 --> 00:16:11,502
be more into specializing in given style and technique?

263
00:16:12,563 --> 00:16:17,686
I would say specialization over everything. I mean, when you're

264
00:16:17,706 --> 00:16:19,727
starting to make a portfolio and you're applying for your first

265
00:16:19,767 --> 00:16:23,449
job or whatever, you should really be focusing more on

266
00:16:23,869 --> 00:16:25,370
quality. So rather than having

267
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:29,396
I'm applying for a character art position, but I've got an

268
00:16:29,436 --> 00:16:31,638
environment, I've got a gun, I've got a car, I've got some

269
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:35,760
concept art. Here's a shader I made and stuff like that. Every

270
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,521
one of those pieces is going to end up being weaker overall

271
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:42,443
because you're not focusing all your energy on being the best

272
00:16:42,483 --> 00:16:45,084
character artist, being the best effects artist, being the best

273
00:16:45,124 --> 00:16:47,306
environment artist and things like that. So.

274
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:54,642
I mean, it's getting good first and then branch out to, you know, you have stylized art and

275
00:16:54,662 --> 00:16:59,905
realistic art or you have some props with your character or you have environment art.

276
00:17:00,025 --> 00:17:04,188
But first is, you know, like Wyeth was saying, quality first and then...

277
00:17:05,048 --> 00:17:06,890
Edit, edit and edit again.

278
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,293
And then reduce your portfolio by half.

279
00:17:10,433 --> 00:17:10,893
Exactly.

280
00:17:12,535 --> 00:17:16,779
I was actually just talking about this the other night with somebody and they said something really interesting.

281
00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:19,721
Because that's frequently a student thing, right?

282
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:26,648
Like, not exclusively students, but typically it's like, okay, so I did this class sophomore year, I did this class junior year, and they don't...

283
00:17:27,602 --> 00:17:31,084
remove, right? Like hopefully you're better your senior year

284
00:17:31,124 --> 00:17:35,287
than you were sophomore year. So get rid of that stuff. But he

285
00:17:35,327 --> 00:17:39,711
said something very interesting. While you're looking for a job,

286
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:43,513
you have a job. Your job is to replace all of the work from

287
00:17:43,553 --> 00:17:45,195
college with new stuff.

288
00:17:45,957 --> 00:17:48,638
And I think that that's a really healthy attitude to have

289
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:50,979
for people who are graduating from school

290
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,400
and looking to get in the industry.

291
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,961
Like, while you're looking, you have a job

292
00:17:55,001 --> 00:17:57,643
and that's replacing all of your student work.

293
00:17:58,443 --> 00:18:00,604
And a good approach to have, too.

294
00:18:00,624 --> 00:18:03,345
I feel like your portfolio's also kind of

295
00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:06,067
a representation of who you are as a person, too.

296
00:18:06,327 --> 00:18:08,428
So it should show your interests,

297
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:09,408
what you really want to do,

298
00:18:09,449 --> 00:18:12,010
like what you could spend every day of your life

299
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,090
devoting yourself to.

300
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:16,714
I mean with school I don't think that's necessarily the case.

301
00:18:16,774 --> 00:18:20,416
You're going to have a curriculum and you have to finish these courses and do whatever

302
00:18:20,476 --> 00:18:21,576
and get a good grade.

303
00:18:22,877 --> 00:18:27,119
Then after that is when you start finding your own voice and start being your own identity.

304
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:34,943
So then Wyeth, any particular standout or failures in construction of a portfolio that

305
00:18:34,963 --> 00:18:35,263
you've seen?

306
00:18:36,028 --> 00:18:41,532
I touched on the flash thing and the Tumblr blog approach. Those are big ones that we see.

307
00:18:41,552 --> 00:18:51,540
Another one is, it kind of piggybacks on what Gavin was talking about, but lack of specialization, it can be really, really confusing for us.

308
00:18:52,737 --> 00:18:55,900
we're not getting the impression of what it is you actually want to do.

309
00:18:56,381 --> 00:19:00,805
You know, you're kind of, we see this a lot with students, right, where you're basically comparing

310
00:19:00,845 --> 00:19:04,229
yourselves to your peers around you, like in the class,

311
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:08,673
and you're kind of saying, well, you know, I'm looking at the people around me

312
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:12,457
and I can model character, and in fact, I think, you know, overall,

313
00:19:12,477 --> 00:19:13,898
maybe I'm stronger than the guys around me.

314
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,893
what you're not doing is comparing yourself to the

315
00:19:16,933 --> 00:19:20,156
industry and to the people on, you know, the people without a

316
00:19:20,176 --> 00:19:24,100
job on poly count or whatever who are just kicking ass and,

317
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,822
you know, you're kind of, you're in your little bubble. And then

318
00:19:26,842 --> 00:19:29,805
what happens is you build your portfolio around that bubble

319
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,548
where you're like, I dabbled, I took a character art class and I

320
00:19:32,828 --> 00:19:34,670
created a character that was kind of compelling and so I

321
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,972
threw him in there and then, well, I went and I did a tech

322
00:19:37,012 --> 00:19:38,773
art thing for a little bit and I learned how to write some

323
00:19:38,794 --> 00:19:40,495
shaders so let me ram those in there as well.

324
00:19:41,474 --> 00:19:44,775
point of view is dead in that approach, right? Because it's

325
00:19:44,815 --> 00:19:48,156
this kind of five-spoked wheel and we don't know, no matter

326
00:19:48,176 --> 00:19:51,096
what you say, oh, I'm applying for character art position, if

327
00:19:51,116 --> 00:19:54,717
those other pieces are there, we can't get your point of view.

328
00:19:54,837 --> 00:19:58,498
We don't get your taste level. And that's a, you know, at the

329
00:19:58,518 --> 00:20:01,159
end of the day, we're hiring somebody that has good taste,

330
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:04,619
right? We're hiring somebody that we can trust to invent and

331
00:20:04,699 --> 00:20:07,480
create and take something like a rough sketch concept and go

332
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,281
interpret it in a way that we think is going to be applicable

333
00:20:10,321 --> 00:20:10,921
to our game.

334
00:20:12,007 --> 00:20:14,952
We're looking at your taste level and we're looking at your kind of passion.

335
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:18,378
That's what we need you to show us.

336
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:23,506
That's how you need to construct this portfolio and this house of cards that you're building.

337
00:20:23,867 --> 00:20:24,829
That's the thing we need to see.

338
00:20:26,462 --> 00:20:30,346
So the other thing that I want to touch upon is how all of you

339
00:20:30,366 --> 00:20:33,268
guys, as many times as you're applying,

340
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:35,310
continue to apply to a lot of these companies

341
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,172
because you never know when they're

342
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:39,534
going to need that person, right?

343
00:20:39,554 --> 00:20:43,197
So it brings me to Sean has some experiences with this.

344
00:20:44,128 --> 00:20:49,390
I'd like to offer up the rest of the panel to bring in their rejection letters at some point.

345
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:57,274
When I first was trying to get a job in the industry, I sent my portfolio, as bad as it was, everywhere, all the time.

346
00:20:58,434 --> 00:21:03,316
Like, I would go back to the same place every three months and just annoy the hell out of them, keep sending it.

347
00:21:03,876 --> 00:21:06,898
And I got rejection letter after rejection letter after rejection letter.

348
00:21:06,978 --> 00:21:11,320
And I still have these at home just to remind me of how long it took for me to get a foot in the door.

349
00:21:12,286 --> 00:21:13,967
And no doesn't always mean no.

350
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:16,869
No means could sometimes mean we're not ready for you yet.

351
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:19,130
We don't have a position for you at this time.

352
00:21:21,051 --> 00:21:23,612
There is an example of someone I had met.

353
00:21:25,253 --> 00:21:27,294
Seen his portfolio, thought I was pretty decent.

354
00:21:27,815 --> 00:21:29,516
But I didn't have anything for him.

355
00:21:29,536 --> 00:21:32,217
It was a four effects art.

356
00:21:33,818 --> 00:21:34,358
A year later.

357
00:21:36,872 --> 00:21:39,815
coincidence. We had just decided that day that we needed a

358
00:21:40,876 --> 00:21:43,819
position open and he e-mailed me the next day out of the blue.

359
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,723
So that's kind of like a feel good affirmation like

360
00:21:47,803 --> 00:21:51,066
coincidence has happened. But the point for me there is that

361
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,171
Despite that it happened literally the next day

362
00:21:54,191 --> 00:21:59,133
I was still gonna call him like he was still number one on my list because at that point

363
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,054
He is the best portfolio that I had seen

364
00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:06,376
So even though I didn't have something for him the year before when I talked to him

365
00:22:07,017 --> 00:22:13,999
The quality of his work definitely stuck in my mind and he was on my short list for getting in contact with but Sean

366
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:15,920
Like how did how did you keep going with that?

367
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,081
lots of alcohol and tears.

368
00:22:20,361 --> 00:22:23,923
Lots of Kleenex, right?

369
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:31,987
I had a lot of good friends at Ringling that really pushed me at the time and I think I

370
00:22:32,027 --> 00:22:37,710
came out of that school with just a very strong drive to never be satisfied.

371
00:22:38,587 --> 00:22:46,209
And I think as artists if you have that drive that you know you keep driving towards the next thing like this isn't good enough

372
00:22:46,229 --> 00:22:48,949
I want to do this. I want to try to make it better

373
00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:50,209
You're going to get better

374
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:55,910
you're going to improve and if you can improve at a rate that you can keep sending your portfolio out and

375
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,871
Don't worry about the mistakes you make you're going to make mistakes

376
00:22:59,771 --> 00:23:05,332
One of my teachers always said you know you had like 10,000 bad drawings, and you just you just got to get them out by practicing

377
00:23:05,352 --> 00:23:07,292
I mean it's

378
00:23:08,306 --> 00:23:13,670
Lame and cliche advice, but I think you just you gotta just put your nose to the grindstone and keep doing it

379
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:19,354
You gotta make sure you don't take it personally right like like we were not your rejection letters are never there frequently

380
00:23:19,454 --> 00:23:20,434
They're almost always

381
00:23:23,155 --> 00:23:27,180
it's not right now, not no, and it's not a critique on who you

382
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:30,645
are. Your timing might be bad, the company's timing might be

383
00:23:30,665 --> 00:23:34,530
bad. The other thing is that companies are generally slower

384
00:23:35,111 --> 00:23:37,875
to react than you want them to, so things move at a little

385
00:23:37,895 --> 00:23:38,856
slower pace than you'd want.

386
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:43,062
But I think not taking it personally and like just okay.

387
00:23:43,442 --> 00:23:45,563
The other thing is if you completely replace your portfolio,

388
00:23:46,103 --> 00:23:47,223
I'm probably not gonna remember.

389
00:23:47,683 --> 00:23:48,664
So it's like a fresh slate.

390
00:23:48,764 --> 00:23:51,044
So I think that's good too.

391
00:23:51,124 --> 00:23:53,845
But you can't take it as a personal slight

392
00:23:54,685 --> 00:23:56,265
and you just keep plugging away.

393
00:23:56,285 --> 00:23:59,986
If it's your dream, do your dream.

394
00:24:02,443 --> 00:24:07,307
don't believe in yourself. Surround yourself by people that care and want to help you, too.

395
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:15,093
There's one thing where I, on the opposite of that, after I got a job at Looking Glass, I went to

396
00:24:15,133 --> 00:24:20,077
visit another company at the time. I can't remember the name. They're out of business now. But when I

397
00:24:20,117 --> 00:24:24,540
was talking to the art director, this was like two years after I sent my portfolio to him, he had

398
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,643
one of my pieces stuck to his cubicle. And I was like, what?

399
00:24:29,127 --> 00:24:31,808
like I really like this piece but it wasn't really what we

400
00:24:31,848 --> 00:24:36,209
needed for the company. So you even get that side of it. People

401
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:40,211
remember you and like the stuff but sometimes the company is

402
00:24:40,251 --> 00:24:41,511
your client, right? If you're

403
00:24:42,429 --> 00:24:45,752
You're not going to be sending super like hardcore realistic

404
00:24:45,812 --> 00:24:47,494
Gears of War stuff to Media Molecule.

405
00:24:47,514 --> 00:24:50,637
So you kind of have to know what your audience is

406
00:24:50,717 --> 00:24:53,880
and what that company is going to want to get out of you.

407
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,002
Yeah, there's a tangential thing in here too

408
00:24:56,022 --> 00:24:57,223
that I think is really important as well,

409
00:24:57,543 --> 00:25:00,666
which is that you guys are not capable of judging your own work.

410
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:06,489
nobody is. This is not exclusive just to people who are students or people who are trying to break in.

411
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:08,970
We are not capable of judging our own work.

412
00:25:09,311 --> 00:25:14,354
You get better at it and you gain an instinct for what's working and what's not and that's kind of as your skills increase

413
00:25:14,394 --> 00:25:16,716
you start to be able to filter a little bit better, but

414
00:25:17,609 --> 00:25:19,871
that's, you know, this is the relationship we have with our

415
00:25:19,911 --> 00:25:22,374
companies all day every day is we make something and then

416
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,797
somebody else comes in and tells us whether it's working or not

417
00:25:25,137 --> 00:25:27,320
because you just can't see it. You're too close, you're too

418
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:31,224
myopic on it. You can't see it. So this is why the communities

419
00:25:31,284 --> 00:25:33,487
that are out there to support people who are up and coming,

420
00:25:33,527 --> 00:25:36,831
like the poly counts or whatever, those are the most

421
00:25:36,871 --> 00:25:38,072
valuable thing. You can't

422
00:25:38,902 --> 00:25:41,382
filter it yourself. You need to put it out there to your

423
00:25:41,422 --> 00:25:43,202
teachers, you need to put it out there to other people in the

424
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:45,543
community, you need to put it out there to your peers, put it

425
00:25:45,563 --> 00:25:48,623
out there to even just send something to a company that you

426
00:25:48,663 --> 00:25:51,504
like and say can you look at this, I'm not applying, can

427
00:25:51,584 --> 00:25:54,124
somebody there look at this? They oftentimes will and they'll

428
00:25:54,144 --> 00:25:56,865
give you feedback. I've done that before. But you're not

429
00:25:56,945 --> 00:26:00,265
capable of judging your own work. You have to absorb that,

430
00:26:00,346 --> 00:26:03,426
put it in your soul and just get the fear out of the way of

431
00:26:03,466 --> 00:26:05,606
showing your work and show it off as much as you can and get

432
00:26:05,646 --> 00:26:06,027
that feedback.

433
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,713
So I'm going to ask this out to the group.

434
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:12,260
Have any of you guys had a very successful candidate story?

435
00:26:13,161 --> 00:26:13,662
An applicant?

436
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:16,949
Yeah.

437
00:26:17,991 --> 00:26:18,632
Yeah, I mean, I think.

438
00:26:19,652 --> 00:26:23,714
I mean, I know that you, we have hired some people looking at portfolios.

439
00:26:23,734 --> 00:26:24,874
What was one that really stood out?

440
00:26:24,894 --> 00:26:25,895
Some things would eventually come back.

441
00:26:25,935 --> 00:26:31,818
Where, you know, a guy that we, we did a portfolio review, right, and then like a couple months

442
00:26:31,858 --> 00:26:34,760
later, you know, he had pretty good stuff.

443
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,962
You know, it didn't happen here, just to be clear, like, no stress in the other room later.

444
00:26:39,822 --> 00:26:44,044
But you know, he had good stuff and he was looking for work once school graduated and

445
00:26:44,084 --> 00:26:46,186
he contacted us again and it just so happened we had a...

446
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:50,329
contractor job and I was like, hey, why don't you move out here

447
00:26:50,389 --> 00:26:55,954
and work for a year with us? And he came out and we hired him

448
00:26:55,974 --> 00:27:01,078
probably about three or four months ago. Just worked out that

449
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:03,721
a position came available and he was doing great work.

450
00:27:04,822 --> 00:27:11,230
and we kept it, you know, so it all happens kind of weird like that, you know.

451
00:27:13,273 --> 00:27:17,258
It's just timing. In a lot of cases it can be timing.

452
00:27:17,399 --> 00:27:18,720
I think to your point, Greg, though, like...

453
00:27:20,317 --> 00:27:23,719
your point of contact, like that person made contact with you

454
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:25,901
and you saw his portfolio, he's probably making contact

455
00:27:25,941 --> 00:27:29,183
with dozens of other places, so you have all these irons

456
00:27:29,223 --> 00:27:30,343
in the fire, so to speak.

457
00:27:30,744 --> 00:27:33,105
So you're not just solely relying on your one,

458
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:35,927
you know, the one place that I'm only gonna work.

459
00:27:36,027 --> 00:27:38,208
You know, you really have to cast a wide net

460
00:27:38,248 --> 00:27:41,430
because you really don't know where these companies are

461
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,191
in their terms of hiring.

462
00:27:43,271 --> 00:27:45,733
Even what's on the website could be a month or two old

463
00:27:45,793 --> 00:27:47,934
because it has to go through so many people before.

464
00:27:48,554 --> 00:27:50,935
a job listing even shows up on a website sometimes.

465
00:27:52,396 --> 00:27:55,738
Gavin, how important is it to be able to talk

466
00:27:55,778 --> 00:27:58,619
about your process and working in general

467
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,680
when you're reviewing a portfolio?

468
00:28:01,461 --> 00:28:06,663
I mean, I think it's important to be able to be

469
00:28:07,844 --> 00:28:11,165
knowledgeable about how you created something

470
00:28:11,185 --> 00:28:12,426
in your portfolio.

471
00:28:12,486 --> 00:28:14,567
I think, depending on discipline, though,

472
00:28:14,587 --> 00:28:15,728
and what you're actually showing.

473
00:28:16,218 --> 00:28:17,519
it's more important for some than others.

474
00:28:17,539 --> 00:28:20,240
And I know it kind of changes for like art director,

475
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,502
like maybe like Wyeth has one opinion and Greg has another,

476
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:25,383
but for me, for character art,

477
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:27,604
like I don't want to see speed sculpts.

478
00:28:27,784 --> 00:28:29,125
I don't want to see sketches.

479
00:28:29,145 --> 00:28:30,405
I don't want to see anything like that

480
00:28:30,525 --> 00:28:34,107
because it's not really showing your quality.

481
00:28:34,147 --> 00:28:38,029
It's not showing, you know, what you do on a daily basis.

482
00:28:38,089 --> 00:28:40,811
It's just kind of like work in progress and throw away work,

483
00:28:40,831 --> 00:28:42,052
something you'd kind of keep in a folder

484
00:28:42,092 --> 00:28:44,733
and you're messing around with it, but not really, you know.

485
00:28:46,249 --> 00:28:51,830
something that will be making it to the game or anything like that. For concept art, for me,

486
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:56,831
that's what I would rather see for a concept artist because most of your job is going to be

487
00:28:56,851 --> 00:29:00,992
talking to the art director about getting an idea across, so you're banging out a bunch of

488
00:29:01,012 --> 00:29:04,593
different sketches, you're banging out a bunch of different ideas, and eventually one will make

489
00:29:04,673 --> 00:29:06,953
it, right? But for character art, that's not the...

490
00:29:07,534 --> 00:29:08,675
It's not the same, not the same deal.

491
00:29:08,695 --> 00:29:13,140
I think for effects, it's very much a process-oriented discussion.

492
00:29:14,702 --> 00:29:22,050
When I get a reel, an effects reel, I see that as the beginning of a conversation between myself and a prospective artist.

493
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:29,398
And when we have the first phone conversation, we talk about process, we talk about that iteration loop.

494
00:29:29,999 --> 00:29:32,681
I mean, you know, it's a very discipline-centric thing,

495
00:29:32,801 --> 00:29:37,226
but for effects, the loop between looking at a piece of work,

496
00:29:37,646 --> 00:29:40,629
making adjustments, seeing it back in context,

497
00:29:40,809 --> 00:29:43,792
and then going through that over and over again until you.

498
00:29:45,068 --> 00:29:51,412
put together something that works within the confines of the game is the job. And so I want to

499
00:29:51,432 --> 00:29:58,956
be able to know that you can speak to that and have a good understanding of what it's actually

500
00:29:59,036 --> 00:30:05,320
like with the day-to-day operation and not just be able to go away, lock yourself in a room and

501
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,543
come up with something pretty that we check into the depot and goes into the game. Like I said,

502
00:30:10,583 --> 00:30:11,423
that's very specific.

503
00:30:12,105 --> 00:30:14,546
to effects and character art is a little bit different,

504
00:30:14,566 --> 00:30:16,448
but I just wanted to offer that different perspective.

505
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,249
Also, chiming in on concept art,

506
00:30:18,709 --> 00:30:21,731
the word concept is in the definition of the job.

507
00:30:22,172 --> 00:30:24,593
Conceptualization is in the job title,

508
00:30:25,054 --> 00:30:26,795
and that's something that gets lost, I think,

509
00:30:26,895 --> 00:30:28,696
almost immediately when you're thinking about,

510
00:30:28,716 --> 00:30:29,997
oh, I want to be a concept artist.

511
00:30:30,337 --> 00:30:31,318
You're not an illustrator.

512
00:30:31,698 --> 00:30:32,599
You're not a painter.

513
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:34,800
You're not anything other than

514
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,521
somebody who is generating ideas.

515
00:30:37,022 --> 00:30:38,482
who is an idea factory.

516
00:30:38,942 --> 00:30:41,962
And if we don't see the thought process of the ideas

517
00:30:42,122 --> 00:30:43,763
which leads to a finished piece,

518
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:45,663
which if you're talented will also be

519
00:30:46,223 --> 00:30:48,384
maybe a beautiful illustration or a beautiful painting

520
00:30:48,464 --> 00:30:50,384
or incredible line art or whatever,

521
00:30:51,184 --> 00:30:53,324
all that stuff is ancillary to why.

522
00:30:53,765 --> 00:30:55,745
Why did I draw the thing that I'm showing you?

523
00:30:56,045 --> 00:30:57,005
We have to know why.

524
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:59,246
We have to know your brain cranking away,

525
00:30:59,466 --> 00:31:01,326
oh, these are my references, my inspiration,

526
00:31:01,366 --> 00:31:03,146
these are some of the silhouettes that I'm presenting.

527
00:31:03,726 --> 00:31:04,926
The why is crucial.

528
00:31:07,028 --> 00:31:09,729
Remember the conceptualization is literally in the job

529
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:10,330
description there.

530
00:31:12,331 --> 00:31:15,293
For character art, I guess for a process to showing how you

531
00:31:15,353 --> 00:31:17,754
actually constructed it is important though, just to make

532
00:31:17,774 --> 00:31:18,255
that clear.

533
00:31:18,295 --> 00:31:22,237
So having good topology, having good UV layout, having an

534
00:31:22,257 --> 00:31:25,379
understanding of physically accurate materials and stuff

535
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:27,020
like that is definitely important.

536
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:31,343
But how you come up with an idea as a character artist, it

537
00:31:31,363 --> 00:31:32,543
doesn't really matter to me.

538
00:31:34,502 --> 00:31:40,107
So Wyeth, do you guys at Epic look at other aspects of

539
00:31:40,127 --> 00:31:44,011
people's online presence when applicants are applying?

540
00:31:45,532 --> 00:31:48,135
Everything that you do is fair game.

541
00:31:48,977 --> 00:31:51,820
Any way that you present yourself out in the world,

542
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,563
whether it's on forum posts, whether it's on Twitter

543
00:31:54,683 --> 00:31:58,186
or Facebook or your blog or even your personal blog

544
00:31:58,226 --> 00:32:00,469
because you really love brewing beer on the side,

545
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:01,770
I'm gonna go read it.

546
00:32:02,971 --> 00:32:04,593
If there's something about you out there

547
00:32:04,653 --> 00:32:06,015
that tells me your taste level,

548
00:32:06,055 --> 00:32:07,336
that tells you your passions,

549
00:32:07,376 --> 00:32:08,737
that you're interested, that you're not,

550
00:32:09,558 --> 00:32:10,619
whether or not you're a dick.

551
00:32:11,978 --> 00:32:13,458
is really, really crucial.

552
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:15,259
I mean, we have to be in a room with you

553
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:16,639
for 40 plus hours a week.

554
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:19,940
You have to be somebody that we think is passionate,

555
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,080
that's hungry, that's talented.

556
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:24,320
So yeah, anything is fair game, right?

557
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,881
And your presence out there in the world

558
00:32:28,261 --> 00:32:29,681
is something that we're interested in.

559
00:32:29,701 --> 00:32:31,922
I mean, we don't always go crazy deep

560
00:32:32,062 --> 00:32:34,242
and we're not weighting that insanely heavily

561
00:32:34,262 --> 00:32:35,943
compared to whether or not you're a good artist.

562
00:32:36,483 --> 00:32:38,984
But if we're on the edge and you're somebody who's,

563
00:32:39,024 --> 00:32:40,164
wow, maybe we'll take a chance,

564
00:32:40,184 --> 00:32:42,245
you don't have any experience but your work is really great,

565
00:32:42,745 --> 00:32:44,386
but then we find your blog and you seem

566
00:32:44,926 --> 00:32:46,506
just not like a great person,

567
00:32:47,086 --> 00:32:49,687
we may just tip us just that far over to go,

568
00:32:49,707 --> 00:32:51,188
you know what, maybe we'll try somebody else.

569
00:32:51,288 --> 00:32:53,129
Maybe we'll dabble in, you know,

570
00:32:53,149 --> 00:32:55,729
take a risk, a chance on somebody who doesn't quite,

571
00:32:55,889 --> 00:32:57,630
you know, we don't think is a cultural problem.

572
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:03,731
Be aware that we are definitely looking at all of the ways you present yourself.

573
00:33:03,891 --> 00:33:09,973
I would also warn everyone that the industry, despite what it seems like here on GDC, is

574
00:33:10,013 --> 00:33:14,854
very small and that chances are you're a friend of a friend of somebody in a company and word

575
00:33:14,894 --> 00:33:18,275
travels fast if you're hard to work with or a difficult person.

576
00:33:18,515 --> 00:33:19,855
We all talk to each other.

577
00:33:23,114 --> 00:33:27,117
There's no reason not to have a good attitude about working

578
00:33:27,137 --> 00:33:31,601
Well, and look, you know, like the online stuff like we're not gonna go look at your Facebook page, right?

579
00:33:31,621 --> 00:33:37,185
Like nobody cares about but um, but when you're on poly count or whatever

580
00:33:39,087 --> 00:33:41,668
came up last year, I told a little story about how we had

581
00:33:42,829 --> 00:33:47,572
actually interviewed somebody and at a certain point some

582
00:33:47,612 --> 00:33:50,474
things maybe triggered that kind of caused us to, because I think

583
00:33:50,494 --> 00:33:54,216
we were discussing poly count. So we actually went and looked

584
00:33:54,296 --> 00:34:03,041
at feedback. And, you know, it wasn't favorable. And it wasn't

585
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,923
that anybody is too blunt. Anybody that knows me knows that

586
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:07,484
that's really not a problem for me.

587
00:34:08,678 --> 00:34:11,581
But chemistry is important to the team.

588
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:15,744
And we all take that very seriously

589
00:34:15,805 --> 00:34:17,426
about the personalities we add.

590
00:34:18,047 --> 00:34:21,350
And so, you know, it spurred a little bit

591
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:22,491
of a conversational poly count.

592
00:34:23,171 --> 00:34:26,494
And you know, like, Gavin is, you know,

593
00:34:26,595 --> 00:34:29,177
Gavin, it does more...

594
00:34:30,077 --> 00:34:32,198
he's more out there with his work than probably the rest

595
00:34:32,218 --> 00:34:35,199
of us on the stage, and so he's, this is a guy

596
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:36,700
who's doing it right, right?

597
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:40,602
Like, he talks a lot, and a lot of good stuff.

598
00:34:40,622 --> 00:34:41,382
Possibly too much.

599
00:34:41,542 --> 00:34:45,704
No, but it's all good stuff, but you're the example of,

600
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:49,905
to me, of a person who handles themselves

601
00:34:51,646 --> 00:34:55,307
in an online presence the way it should be done.

602
00:34:55,408 --> 00:34:55,688
Yeah.

603
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:56,828
Professional.

604
00:34:57,208 --> 00:34:57,748
Yeah.

605
00:34:57,788 --> 00:34:58,949
Yeah, I think, like.

606
00:34:59,946 --> 00:35:03,847
at the risk of sounding too much like Kanye up here, you've

607
00:35:03,867 --> 00:35:07,468
got to kind of look at yourself as a brand. Everything you're

608
00:35:07,508 --> 00:35:10,629
putting out there needs to reflect you as a possible

609
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,890
employee or as a professional or whatever. It's not like

610
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:15,991
everything you ever say has to be on point and super

611
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:19,672
intellectual and I'm the smartest guy in the room or

612
00:35:19,712 --> 00:35:20,153
whatever. But

613
00:35:21,693 --> 00:35:26,258
it's a super small industry, it's a quick search to see if

614
00:35:26,318 --> 00:35:29,201
someone is going to fit with your team. You're hiring the

615
00:35:29,241 --> 00:35:33,205
person as well as a great artist. You have to sit

616
00:35:33,265 --> 00:35:35,688
shoulder to shoulder with this person for years working on a

617
00:35:35,728 --> 00:35:39,391
game and you'll be stressed and all of this. So it's really

618
00:35:39,431 --> 00:35:42,314
important to always have that in your mind when you're

619
00:35:42,995 --> 00:35:45,576
you're giving feedback on a forum, like if you're a

620
00:35:46,056 --> 00:35:50,459
complete ass about it or if you're just always railing on

621
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:53,941
games or different people and stuff like that, it's going to

622
00:35:53,981 --> 00:35:58,503
hurt you. You can always be blunt and honest as long as

623
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:02,345
you're being professional. At the end of the day, you don't

624
00:36:02,365 --> 00:36:04,886
want to wake up and go, well, I probably shouldn't have said

625
00:36:04,926 --> 00:36:09,429
that. And once you've tweeted it or you've put it on

626
00:36:09,449 --> 00:36:10,409
polycount, it's done.

627
00:36:12,157 --> 00:36:12,858
something to think about.

628
00:36:12,978 --> 00:36:15,941
Well, I mean, you're working on a multi-million dollar product, right?

629
00:36:16,281 --> 00:36:20,745
And you want someone who's going to represent the brand and your company respectfully and

630
00:36:20,825 --> 00:36:23,167
correct because it's also a recruiting technique.

631
00:36:23,207 --> 00:36:28,932
So yes, Gavin, you really, when you go out and you talk, you actually aren't going and

632
00:36:29,232 --> 00:36:32,755
attacking people or making these random comments.

633
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:37,039
You're actually being constructive and actually putting forth something for the industry to

634
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:37,780
take away from.

635
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:44,285
I think we all up here, the reason why we are trying to drive this home is for a reason.

636
00:36:45,266 --> 00:36:50,210
We have seen lots of problems online and don't think when you are applying people aren't

637
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:50,711
checking.

638
00:36:52,913 --> 00:36:53,393
Fair enough?

639
00:36:53,673 --> 00:36:54,274
Yeah, definitely.

640
00:36:55,395 --> 00:36:56,716
Okay.

641
00:36:56,736 --> 00:37:01,300
So Steve, what are the, what area of game are

642
00:37:01,851 --> 00:37:05,713
production do you see more demand than talent for right now?

643
00:37:06,554 --> 00:37:11,357
Well, like I mentioned at the beginning, effects is definitely an area where I feel that there's

644
00:37:11,397 --> 00:37:18,221
more demand than available talent. The other two areas that I would say are UI, user interface,

645
00:37:18,341 --> 00:37:23,385
and technical art. I think that's a big area that we're trying to address.

646
00:37:25,739 --> 00:37:29,004
much better perspective on the various types of technical

647
00:37:29,044 --> 00:37:32,988
artists that are needed now. It is interesting because it's

648
00:37:33,029 --> 00:37:36,273
fracturing now where you've got tech animators and that's a job

649
00:37:36,313 --> 00:37:39,597
of rigging, I'm making sure I'm supporting the people who are

650
00:37:39,617 --> 00:37:42,040
doing animation by giving them good bones and guts to work

651
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,720
with and good tools.

652
00:37:43,321 --> 00:37:45,762
and then you've got kind of the shader side, which is, hey, I'm

653
00:37:45,782 --> 00:37:48,404
making tech art that's relevant inside of the game engine

654
00:37:48,464 --> 00:37:51,746
itself, doing, you know, materials work or landscape

655
00:37:51,786 --> 00:37:54,627
work or blueprint work, visual scripting, that kind of thing.

656
00:37:55,108 --> 00:37:56,989
And then you've got the kind of bones and guts underground

657
00:37:57,049 --> 00:37:59,850
tools guys, like I'm writing Python scripts for import,

658
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:02,812
export pipelines, or I'm, you know, getting really, really

659
00:38:02,832 --> 00:38:06,654
deep into the technical side of, like, tool support, almost

660
00:38:06,694 --> 00:38:09,676
tool programming, but not quite. So that's three different

661
00:38:09,756 --> 00:38:12,698
things. And all of those jobs, you could.

662
00:38:13,836 --> 00:38:16,621
we will hire a great person immediately. I know every other

663
00:38:16,641 --> 00:38:18,624
game company on the planet pretty much is the same way.

664
00:38:18,885 --> 00:38:20,488
I'm seeing effects.

665
00:38:21,622 --> 00:38:25,843
grow into much more than just particle manipulation and more

666
00:38:26,024 --> 00:38:31,785
into shader application for glowing armor or shield bubbles

667
00:38:32,045 --> 00:38:35,746
in the case of destiny all of the space magic is starting to

668
00:38:35,766 --> 00:38:40,948
get more and more like actual physical models with interesting

669
00:38:41,008 --> 00:38:46,269
shaders applied to it and that is a discreet skill which is

670
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:51,371
becoming more and more important as the industry moves forward.

671
00:38:52,389 --> 00:38:56,791
I'd like to take this time to, if anybody has questions, to take this opportunity and

672
00:38:56,831 --> 00:38:57,932
line up at the podiums.

673
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:03,576
The microphone is on the side and while people are lining up I'm going to ask one more question

674
00:39:04,036 --> 00:39:05,837
before we get to the Q&A section.

675
00:39:05,857 --> 00:39:06,718
Sounds good?

676
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:10,620
So we're hearing a lot about ART tests.

677
00:39:11,541 --> 00:39:13,042
Does anybody have any comments on that?

678
00:39:13,062 --> 00:39:16,604
I test everybody.

679
00:39:19,974 --> 00:39:24,838
I believe it's important only because there's so many art

680
00:39:24,898 --> 00:39:30,083
thieves out there. It's showing commitment to the application.

681
00:39:31,324 --> 00:39:35,387
It's showing how you can work with a team at a very small

682
00:39:35,427 --> 00:39:39,430
scale. So handing something in, getting feedback from an art

683
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:41,972
director, addressing that feedback and how you're going to

684
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:45,315
respond. By that being said, it's not.

685
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:52,445
The way that I do it isn't testing literally everybody who applies. It's you know, you could filter down you

686
00:39:53,086 --> 00:39:55,408
Potentially are a good fit. You have a great portfolio

687
00:39:56,689 --> 00:39:59,772
Get tested and then you know, basically start that process

688
00:40:01,579 --> 00:40:06,001
I would just add on one thing. Don't be too intimidated as well. And we're the same way.

689
00:40:06,242 --> 00:40:09,624
Everybody tests. I don't care if you're a 30-year industry veteran. Everybody tests.

690
00:40:10,364 --> 00:40:15,007
But there's another side of it, too, which is don't be super intimidated if you get a

691
00:40:15,047 --> 00:40:18,569
test and it looks like the scope is way out of your comfort zone. Like, oh, my God, I

692
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:22,111
don't know if I can do a whole character in two weeks or whatever they're asking me to

693
00:40:22,151 --> 00:40:27,034
do. Try. Because a lot of times what we're doing is we're actually designing a test that's

694
00:40:27,114 --> 00:40:28,235
kind of too hard.

695
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:32,432
it's a little bit too tough for the parameters in which we're

696
00:40:32,912 --> 00:40:36,514
giving it to you because so much of the skill is cutting the

697
00:40:36,594 --> 00:40:40,016
right corners and showing us, well, I wasn't able to model the

698
00:40:40,036 --> 00:40:43,418
whole guy but I got half done and I did a symmetry modifier

699
00:40:43,438 --> 00:40:46,059
and did a little bit of extra stuff above and beyond that to

700
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,420
show some asymmetry and we're going to see, okay, they cut the

701
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:51,342
right corner to finish the test even though it wasn't exactly

702
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:54,704
the parameters. So sometimes we're actually doing that

703
00:40:54,844 --> 00:40:56,145
intentionally. So don't get too crazy.

704
00:40:58,986 --> 00:41:04,907
correct. So let's begin the questions. Okay. So you guys

705
00:41:04,927 --> 00:41:07,368
were talking about, you know, like internet presence and

706
00:41:07,388 --> 00:41:11,569
stuff. I was wondering, is there like an effect if someone lacks

707
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:17,931
any kind of like presence on the internet? I don't think that's

708
00:41:17,991 --> 00:41:21,032
any, as long as your portfolio is strong, it's not really, we're

709
00:41:21,052 --> 00:41:24,353
not hiring somebody because of Tumblr skills or Twitter skills.

710
00:41:26,434 --> 00:41:32,000
I think that we're really looking for a solid artist.

711
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,464
The social media stuff can help,

712
00:41:35,484 --> 00:41:37,486
like if you have other work on your Tumblr site

713
00:41:37,506 --> 00:41:39,989
that we can flip through, whatever is fine,

714
00:41:40,029 --> 00:41:41,951
but it's never a mark against you.

715
00:41:41,971 --> 00:41:43,653
Okay, thanks.

716
00:41:47,026 --> 00:41:51,949
One thing I've heard a lot is you should really tailor like your resume and your cover letter to the company you're applying for

717
00:41:51,969 --> 00:41:54,590
But what about the overall portfolio?

718
00:41:54,730 --> 00:42:00,073
So like I've kind of heard that you should have like a portfolio for this company and then a portfolio for this company and something

719
00:42:00,113 --> 00:42:03,675
Like that. I think you're probably gonna burn out

720
00:42:04,075 --> 00:42:05,576
After a while, you know, I mean

721
00:42:06,597 --> 00:42:10,799
for me, I would tell you to do what you really want to do, you know, like if you're

722
00:42:12,245 --> 00:42:14,006
really want to do stylized stuff, if you want to do like

723
00:42:14,046 --> 00:42:16,666
League of Legends art or something like that, but you're

724
00:42:16,706 --> 00:42:21,547
throwing your portfolio off to, you know, Activision or, you

725
00:42:21,587 --> 00:42:24,608
know, Naughty Dog or something like that, I mean, if you don't

726
00:42:24,628 --> 00:42:27,568
really want to do that day in, day out, eventually you're going

727
00:42:27,588 --> 00:42:31,669
to get tired anyway. So I mean, I would focus on the one thing

728
00:42:31,689 --> 00:42:34,390
that you want to do, make it as best as possible and just hit up

729
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:37,490
the companies that are in that wheelhouse, you know?

730
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:45,883
nice. If it's a forum cover letter. Anything you say in

731
00:42:45,903 --> 00:42:47,844
there is always a nice little touch. Again, we don't get to

732
00:42:47,904 --> 00:42:50,585
that until probably the third or fourth thing I'm going to look

733
00:42:50,645 --> 00:42:56,869
at. But yeah. Thank you. I was just wondering what is an

734
00:42:56,949 --> 00:43:00,490
effective way to present technical art like materials and

735
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:02,692
shaders and visual blue printing and stuff. Is it

736
00:43:03,337 --> 00:43:05,737
you guys were touching on whether to do a reel or whether

737
00:43:05,757 --> 00:43:09,538
to do stills. I was wondering on your opinion of effective

738
00:43:09,558 --> 00:43:14,000
presentation of technical art. Tech art is super broad. Some

739
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:18,041
of it is the avenue of tech art that you're in. If you're doing

740
00:43:18,101 --> 00:43:21,002
a rigging reel, even if you're just doing technical stuff,

741
00:43:21,022 --> 00:43:24,543
you're going to need to show the effects of that rig on deforming

742
00:43:24,583 --> 00:43:26,964
meshes. We're going to need to see that stuff in motion. And

743
00:43:27,384 --> 00:43:29,645
then breakdowns of the offline stuff that goes around it like

744
00:43:29,685 --> 00:43:31,405
here are the scripts I wrote or whatever. You're going to want

745
00:43:31,425 --> 00:43:31,725
to see that.

746
00:43:32,446 --> 00:43:35,427
it comes to shaders, we almost always want to see that stuff

747
00:43:35,447 --> 00:43:38,709
in motion. So I think some stills showing, hey, here's some

748
00:43:38,729 --> 00:43:40,570
of the shader graphs, here's the logic, maybe here are the

749
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:43,092
functions that I derived my math from, here's some of the white

750
00:43:43,132 --> 00:43:46,934
papers that I read that inspired the tech that I'm doing in the

751
00:43:46,974 --> 00:43:50,256
game level itself. And then seeing it in motion with some

752
00:43:50,296 --> 00:43:54,319
real samples is probably the right thing to do. You know,

753
00:43:54,579 --> 00:43:56,580
when in doubt, a combination of

754
00:43:57,361 --> 00:44:00,924
stills and video can work very well when you're really not sure

755
00:44:00,964 --> 00:44:03,947
if just one or the other is the right category for you. So I

756
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:06,149
would say, you know, if something you need to see it in

757
00:44:06,189 --> 00:44:08,531
motion, do the video, even if it's just for that section, kind

758
00:44:08,571 --> 00:44:11,134
of break it down piece by piece. And that's fine, too. And we'll

759
00:44:11,174 --> 00:44:13,937
do the work of scrolling through it as long as it isn't crazy,

760
00:44:14,237 --> 00:44:14,437
you know?

761
00:44:15,618 --> 00:44:21,522
you have an awesome material, stick it on a cube. Does it

762
00:44:21,562 --> 00:44:25,524
matter that it's not on the prettiest model or the best art

763
00:44:25,724 --> 00:44:27,765
but it's an awesome shader or material?

764
00:44:28,286 --> 00:44:31,948
Presentation matters. If that would look better on a high

765
00:44:31,968 --> 00:44:35,230
quality model, find one from somebody else or download one.

766
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:38,192
You know what I mean? And make a note that says this isn't my

767
00:44:38,232 --> 00:44:40,333
model but look at how good the shader looks. We're going to

768
00:44:40,353 --> 00:44:43,615
want to see that. Also it shows us he's got good taste. He

769
00:44:43,655 --> 00:44:44,496
knows it would look better.

770
00:44:46,758 --> 00:44:49,261
character rather than just on a sphere and you made that choice

771
00:44:49,321 --> 00:44:53,305
and you lit it and it has nice aesthetics or whatever. So the

772
00:44:53,886 --> 00:44:56,449
presentation matters for sure. But if you're not a modeler,

773
00:44:56,609 --> 00:44:59,452
don't try to do it. Then we won't be able to get past the

774
00:44:59,472 --> 00:45:01,815
bad model. Again, like you said, find one.

775
00:45:03,257 --> 00:45:06,800
that would be the fly on the stick. I think there's ways

776
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,122
around it. If you're doing a skin shader or something like

777
00:45:09,142 --> 00:45:13,485
that and you download a scanned head but you're applying for a

778
00:45:13,525 --> 00:45:17,769
technical art position, no one is going to look at it as, wow,

779
00:45:17,809 --> 00:45:21,792
you modeled a great head. It's just a scan? Shitty. But the

780
00:45:21,853 --> 00:45:24,795
opposite would be true. I'm trying to do technical art but

781
00:45:24,835 --> 00:45:27,818
it looks like garbage on a cube or something. It's, you know.

782
00:45:28,498 --> 00:45:32,823
going to be bad. All they'll be able to look at is that cube and not focus on what you're

783
00:45:32,843 --> 00:45:33,604
actually trying to show.

784
00:45:33,744 --> 00:45:37,528
And just make sure you're accrediting other people's work so there's no confusion.

785
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:39,050
Totally.

786
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:39,330
Thank you.

787
00:45:41,092 --> 00:45:42,233
Hi, you guys touched on

788
00:45:44,263 --> 00:45:46,624
If you're planning for a character artist to put your

789
00:45:46,644 --> 00:45:50,245
character art or environment to just tailor your portfolio to

790
00:45:50,425 --> 00:45:53,726
what you want to work for. What are your guys' opinions on,

791
00:45:54,006 --> 00:45:57,507
because I've heard about specializing to get it and

792
00:45:57,587 --> 00:46:00,468
usually you want to specialize to get into a triple A studio,

793
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:04,109
but you want to work at a smaller studio, then generalist

794
00:46:04,169 --> 00:46:07,030
might be better because you'll be doing more things. What's

795
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:08,211
your guys' opinion on that?

796
00:46:08,671 --> 00:46:09,751
Go ahead.

797
00:46:11,398 --> 00:46:13,820
I think overall that's a true statement.

798
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,641
The smaller the studio, the more hats you're going to have to wear.

799
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:23,686
Once you get into, you know, 100 plus people working in a studio, then you have the luxury

800
00:46:24,247 --> 00:46:28,630
to really specialize and one person can be really the best person at that one particular

801
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:32,092
thing and you just hyper focus on that one thing.

802
00:46:33,073 --> 00:46:38,997
There's always exceptions to the rules, of course, but I think as a rule of thumb, I've

803
00:46:39,317 --> 00:46:40,598
generally seen that to be the case.

804
00:46:42,763 --> 00:46:44,223
The big thing is just edit, right?

805
00:46:44,323 --> 00:46:47,664
So if you're not really, if you took one figure drawing class

806
00:46:47,724 --> 00:46:49,365
and you have a couple of crappy figure drawings,

807
00:46:49,685 --> 00:46:51,285
we don't want to see those, you know?

808
00:46:51,586 --> 00:46:54,146
It's like you have to edit and still show solid work

809
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:55,006
in all those categories.

810
00:46:55,026 --> 00:46:58,988
30-second gestures don't really do it for us.

811
00:46:59,048 --> 00:46:59,768
Yeah, totally.

812
00:46:59,888 --> 00:47:01,928
So you just, again, you have to be able to edit

813
00:47:02,108 --> 00:47:03,989
and solid work in those categories,

814
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:05,289
even if you're trying to be a generalist.

815
00:47:05,569 --> 00:47:07,630
You have to make sure that they're elevated

816
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:09,310
to a point where you're comparing yourself

817
00:47:09,331 --> 00:47:10,651
to the quality of the industry.

818
00:47:11,389 --> 00:47:13,491
And pay attention to the job description itself.

819
00:47:14,452 --> 00:47:20,859
You want to make sure that if you are putting together a portfolio for a specific description,

820
00:47:20,999 --> 00:47:26,024
maybe you are looking at a description that says, hey, we want someone who can model and

821
00:47:26,144 --> 00:47:27,245
rig and texture.

822
00:47:27,725 --> 00:47:31,229
And then you can show proficiency in those, assuming you follow all the other rules.

823
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:38,197
But if you're applying to a larger company that is asking for specialization in the job description,

824
00:47:38,597 --> 00:47:42,862
I'll usually tell you it's like, oh, this is the only thing that we want to see is this specific area.

825
00:47:44,748 --> 00:47:47,531
Thank you.

826
00:47:47,751 --> 00:47:52,615
So I'm very interested in doing game design, game mechanics.

827
00:47:52,795 --> 00:47:57,499
And I wonder if at studios, for game design and game mechanics,

828
00:47:57,699 --> 00:47:59,080
would people have a demo reel?

829
00:47:59,341 --> 00:48:03,024
Or would they just submit more links to their games?

830
00:48:03,164 --> 00:48:06,807
Or how would that process work for more into game design?

831
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:10,250
Industrial design?

832
00:48:12,023 --> 00:48:15,184
So like level design or game mechanics and things like that.

833
00:48:15,424 --> 00:48:17,184
I don't know if you guys know.

834
00:48:17,224 --> 00:48:19,825
More like game play and actual design.

835
00:48:20,065 --> 00:48:22,485
Yeah, game play.

836
00:48:22,505 --> 00:48:27,627
Yeah, the designer portfolio is a bit of a black box.

837
00:48:27,727 --> 00:48:32,768
I mean, when you're hiring a designer, you're looking at different things

838
00:48:33,128 --> 00:48:36,389
than looking at what we call architects or level builders,

839
00:48:36,429 --> 00:48:39,350
the people that are taking the art and constructing the space.

840
00:48:40,233 --> 00:48:44,266
keeping mindful of tactical considerations and line of sight

841
00:48:44,346 --> 00:48:45,510
and how it's going to stream in.

842
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:52,144
I mean, again, it's specific to what are you trying to do.

843
00:48:52,225 --> 00:48:54,386
If you're trying to be a level builder that's going to

844
00:48:54,526 --> 00:48:58,249
construct worlds that the player can walk around in, that

845
00:48:58,309 --> 00:49:00,731
may not necessarily be built out of the models that you

846
00:49:00,791 --> 00:49:03,993
have built, but you're placing the models to create the

847
00:49:04,033 --> 00:49:08,316
world, I think you need to show those spaces, even if it's a

848
00:49:08,376 --> 00:49:11,759
level we can download, because nowadays most engines you can

849
00:49:11,799 --> 00:49:15,361
download for free, and you have a package that you can load

850
00:49:15,401 --> 00:49:16,282
this level and walk through it.

851
00:49:17,364 --> 00:49:21,472
or it can be a fly through, unless of course it's

852
00:49:21,532 --> 00:49:23,476
environment, art, and then wife will get mad at me.

853
00:49:25,752 --> 00:49:30,534
design really can only be experienced through play, and so you have to have something interactive.

854
00:49:30,894 --> 00:49:35,215
And that's just the be all, end all. You can't show good design in a video. It's just not

855
00:49:35,255 --> 00:49:40,797
possible. You can show good theory and you can talk about it in Flip Portfolio, but at the end

856
00:49:40,817 --> 00:49:45,839
of the day, if we can't put our hands on it, touch it and play it, that's the end of the story.

857
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:50,361
Also I will say this, with art candidates, a lot of times they apply, and if they've

858
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:53,082
past the art test and the portfolio review,

859
00:49:53,462 --> 00:49:55,703
we're interviewing them for the most part as a culture fit.

860
00:49:56,023 --> 00:49:57,803
By the time they get it, they're footing the door

861
00:49:57,823 --> 00:49:58,764
and in the building.

862
00:49:59,084 --> 00:50:00,304
You know, we realize you're a good artist.

863
00:50:00,324 --> 00:50:01,304
You've already tested, we like that.

864
00:50:01,344 --> 00:50:02,185
You passed those gates.

865
00:50:02,685 --> 00:50:04,726
With a designer, oftentimes we play

866
00:50:04,766 --> 00:50:06,086
and we experience what it is you've done,

867
00:50:06,466 --> 00:50:08,207
but there's a big component once you get on site

868
00:50:08,227 --> 00:50:10,227
of talking about your philosophy of design

869
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:11,388
to the people in the room.

870
00:50:11,848 --> 00:50:13,408
And so those are, you gotta come prepared

871
00:50:13,889 --> 00:50:15,789
for both of those things.

872
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:16,790
Thank you.

873
00:50:18,686 --> 00:50:25,450
Hello, I was just wondering, what do you guys look for in a level design portfolio?

874
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:29,852
What stands out to you and what are things that shouldn't be done and or should?

875
00:50:32,698 --> 00:50:34,879
level design. You mean environment art or level design

876
00:50:35,859 --> 00:50:38,440
like building the level that will get arted up by

877
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,102
environment artist? Building a level of game play and what

878
00:50:42,162 --> 00:50:47,124
not. Sort of similar to the last question. Yeah, it is

879
00:50:47,164 --> 00:50:49,324
pretty similar to the last question. I think one of the

880
00:50:49,845 --> 00:50:51,005
we hired a guy on XCOM 2 that

881
00:50:51,905 --> 00:50:54,526
he had come in for an interview, first of all he had made a site

882
00:50:55,086 --> 00:50:58,908
that had dissected everything we did in XCOM enemy unknown and

883
00:50:59,048 --> 00:51:04,649
had like sequence shots of like the level and what was happening

884
00:51:04,669 --> 00:51:09,271
there. He had figured out all of our mechanics and then came in

885
00:51:09,291 --> 00:51:11,591
for an interview, as if that wasn't enough, came in for an

886
00:51:11,611 --> 00:51:13,892
interview before we could even respond to him.

887
00:51:14,278 --> 00:51:16,659
he had gone home and applied all the new mechanics we had added

888
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,120
and made a totally different level and sent us basically a

889
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:25,021
gray box of that. That was a pretty good move. He was going

890
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:28,022
to get the job anyway. But after that it was like there's no way

891
00:51:28,062 --> 00:51:32,103
we can't hire him. But, yeah, it's a little bit different. I

892
00:51:32,143 --> 00:51:35,744
think you have to show your thought process as well with

893
00:51:35,764 --> 00:51:38,465
level design. It's a weird

894
00:51:39,506 --> 00:51:45,810
It's a little bit of a weird one and I've seen it done various ways for instance on bash like infinite when we were looking

895
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:52,314
At level designers we were very concerned more more concerned with how they could tell a story in the world

896
00:51:52,694 --> 00:51:59,258
Then if they were good at like setting up tactical space because we had a design team that would you know that that they would

897
00:51:59,298 --> 00:52:03,981
Work with when it comes to setting up tactical space, but we were much more concerned at that point with

898
00:52:04,572 --> 00:52:07,215
can we bring somebody on that is good at telling a story

899
00:52:07,616 --> 00:52:09,358
of what has happened in the world.

900
00:52:09,438 --> 00:52:11,381
So we were looking at that specifically,

901
00:52:11,401 --> 00:52:15,366
not so much like tactical walk space and things like that.

902
00:52:16,387 --> 00:52:17,549
So again, know your studio.

903
00:52:17,569 --> 00:52:19,932
All right, thank you.

904
00:52:22,179 --> 00:52:25,783
So you were saying that the UI and technical art positions were

905
00:52:25,924 --> 00:52:29,127
less competitive than some of the other ones. So what would

906
00:52:29,147 --> 00:52:33,472
you say the specialties that are more competitive versus ones

907
00:52:33,512 --> 00:52:37,136
that are less competitive? Character art? Concept art?

908
00:52:37,456 --> 00:52:39,979
Character art? Those are pretty hard. Lots of competition

909
00:52:39,999 --> 00:52:40,900
there. Yeah.

910
00:52:43,949 --> 00:52:47,051
I mean, again, you look at the majors and schools and stuff

911
00:52:47,111 --> 00:52:50,234
and where things tend to gravitate.

912
00:52:50,254 --> 00:52:52,556
And it's a broader stroke.

913
00:52:52,596 --> 00:52:53,938
It appeals to more people, I think.

914
00:52:55,319 --> 00:52:59,382
And so I also don't think people think about, wow, I mean,

915
00:52:59,422 --> 00:53:02,685
you mean I could actually do UI and motion graphics for a game?

916
00:53:02,705 --> 00:53:05,388
I just don't think that that hits.

917
00:53:06,569 --> 00:53:08,210
People that do that much, like graphic designers,

918
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:10,751
would be natural fits in a lot of cases.

919
00:53:10,791 --> 00:53:13,953
They just aren't thinking about games all the time.

920
00:53:14,734 --> 00:53:18,536
But again, modeling and animation

921
00:53:18,656 --> 00:53:21,678
tend to be your kind of go-to's and concept, of course.

922
00:53:22,138 --> 00:53:23,679
But just the competition's more fierce

923
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,361
because those jobs have existed longer.

924
00:53:26,381 --> 00:53:26,421
So.

925
00:53:27,521 --> 00:53:28,982
I think it's just like naturally,

926
00:53:29,643 --> 00:53:31,784
like a good UI no one notices.

927
00:53:31,904 --> 00:53:32,324
Yep.

928
00:53:32,464 --> 00:53:33,925
Like everyone notices a bad UI.

929
00:53:34,881 --> 00:53:37,744
and paired with that, everybody wants to make monsters.

930
00:53:38,244 --> 00:53:40,466
So if you can make a career making monsters,

931
00:53:40,506 --> 00:53:42,247
you'd probably gravitate towards that.

932
00:53:42,327 --> 00:53:44,249
There's not many people that are like,

933
00:53:44,369 --> 00:53:47,412
I can't wait to make health bars, that's going to be awesome.

934
00:53:54,033 --> 00:53:58,757
So why if you were talking about like a portfolio that you came back to

935
00:54:00,098 --> 00:54:05,042
Because you like something about it. I was just wondering have you guys experienced something similar and

936
00:54:05,422 --> 00:54:08,965
Did you eventually hire that person and why did you come back? Why did you stay?

937
00:54:10,267 --> 00:54:12,549
What kept you checking out, updating?

938
00:54:12,669 --> 00:54:14,951
Well, so for me it was somebody who was really, really good.

939
00:54:15,331 --> 00:54:20,054
It just, they're real, didn't, you know, satisfied something that we didn't need at that moment.

940
00:54:20,515 --> 00:54:23,757
And usually in that case I'll just put it into a special bookmark folder of...

941
00:54:24,465 --> 00:54:27,488
people that are good that we don't need at the moment. And

942
00:54:27,508 --> 00:54:30,330
then every once in a while, it's all deeply categorized by their

943
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:33,633
specialty and what they do and when I found them. I actually

944
00:54:33,653 --> 00:54:36,856
have a pretty good system for all of that. So if something

945
00:54:36,896 --> 00:54:39,898
comes up, I'll go back and look through that. So that was just a

946
00:54:39,979 --> 00:54:42,341
simple case of, oh, you seem really good. Maybe someday we'll

947
00:54:42,381 --> 00:54:43,722
need someone like you.

948
00:54:45,739 --> 00:54:48,602
I mean, talent is talent. And when you see somebody who has a

949
00:54:48,642 --> 00:54:53,407
lot of talent, you take notice. You tend to remember them. And

950
00:54:53,447 --> 00:54:56,510
similar to Wi-Fi, I have the same folder where I'll just keep

951
00:54:56,690 --> 00:55:00,394
dragging images or website links into this folder. That's kind of

952
00:55:00,414 --> 00:55:01,475
like my save for later.

953
00:55:02,656 --> 00:55:08,358
And if something comes up and we need a very specific role to be filled then I have people that have already

954
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:12,039
Kind of vetted then that'll be my starting point, so I don't have to start from scratch

955
00:55:13,459 --> 00:55:16,720
In the case of the person I said that we had hired a year later

956
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:21,521
it just you know at the time we didn't need an effects artist and I

957
00:55:22,342 --> 00:55:24,242
His portfolio is really good a year later

958
00:55:24,262 --> 00:55:30,924
I had remembered it and when an effects position became open he was the first person I was gonna call and we ended up hiring him

959
00:55:31,821 --> 00:55:35,882
But that was because it stuck in my mind.

960
00:55:36,802 --> 00:55:38,722
His work was good and his process was good

961
00:55:38,762 --> 00:55:40,203
and he knew what he was talking about.

962
00:55:40,223 --> 00:55:44,063
He was very solid foundation of what he was doing.

963
00:55:44,543 --> 00:55:45,824
So that kind of stuck with me.

964
00:55:46,504 --> 00:55:48,624
So the best story I have for that is that

965
00:55:48,644 --> 00:55:51,105
I had a guy I met at GBC,

966
00:55:51,125 --> 00:55:54,205
I guess 10 years ago now.

967
00:55:56,966 --> 00:55:58,206
He was one of the IGD scholars

968
00:55:58,646 --> 00:55:59,786
and we got to know each other.

969
00:56:01,965 --> 00:56:04,667
He went off to work at a couple of different major studios

970
00:56:05,468 --> 00:56:07,630
and I kept checking on him every now and then.

971
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:11,574
And we had an opening up about a year and a half ago

972
00:56:12,314 --> 00:56:13,455
and so I called him up and I said,

973
00:56:13,475 --> 00:56:17,159
hey Morgan, you want to come interview for a job?

974
00:56:17,179 --> 00:56:20,321
And he's like, yeah, I think I'd like to do that.

975
00:56:20,382 --> 00:56:23,725
So a kid that I met nine years ago.

976
00:56:24,783 --> 00:56:27,385
I ended up hiring about a year and a half ago.

977
00:56:27,805 --> 00:56:29,887
And so it just worked out that way.

978
00:56:30,027 --> 00:56:33,149
What I needed was what he had actually gravitated to

979
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:36,011
and it was just a great fit.

980
00:56:36,031 --> 00:56:38,994
But yeah, it took nine years to get there, but we got there.

981
00:56:40,610 --> 00:56:44,412
I had an applicant one time that the timing just wasn't right,

982
00:56:46,133 --> 00:56:47,894
but I liked him, we had a good conversation.

983
00:56:48,974 --> 00:56:51,936
But there wasn't a good fit for the company, so I actually

984
00:56:52,416 --> 00:56:55,338
called up a friend who worked for another local studio

985
00:56:56,338 --> 00:56:58,880
and pushed him over there, totally self-serving.

986
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:04,523
But a couple years later I called him up and said, hey, we have a need for these skills.

987
00:57:04,603 --> 00:57:06,384
Do you want to come over?

988
00:57:08,605 --> 00:57:13,688
looked at his portfolio, it had been refreshed, all new stuff, and it was a pretty easy hire

989
00:57:13,728 --> 00:57:14,088
after that.

990
00:57:15,929 --> 00:57:16,289
Thank you.

991
00:57:18,751 --> 00:57:19,091
Good day.

992
00:57:20,772 --> 00:57:25,714
I just wanted to know, you were mentioning the tumbler thingy before.

993
00:57:27,055 --> 00:57:32,918
I was wondering if the same rules apply to websites like LinkedIn, for example.

994
00:57:33,278 --> 00:57:34,479
Do you guys check that out?

995
00:57:36,137 --> 00:57:38,618
Do you have a LinkedIn account or something like that?

996
00:57:39,238 --> 00:57:39,939
I use LinkedIn.

997
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:45,822
I've had a number of applicants reach out to me through LinkedIn and show me their portfolios.

998
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:46,722
I think it's a great tool.

999
00:57:47,823 --> 00:57:49,944
But it's not an art display tool.

1000
00:57:50,084 --> 00:57:54,607
So all it is is a communication device to find people like us or hiring managers or

1001
00:57:54,647 --> 00:57:54,967
whatever.

1002
00:57:55,087 --> 00:57:56,508
So you still need a portfolio.

1003
00:57:56,748 --> 00:57:59,209
You still need a dedicated website that is a portfolio site.

1004
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:01,290
I have two more questions.

1005
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:03,712
What would you call the art display tool?

1006
00:58:04,632 --> 00:58:05,573
What do you mean by that?

1007
00:58:06,756 --> 00:58:11,041
The purpose for LinkedIn is to be just an online resume, right?

1008
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:16,806
And anything beyond that would be like your portfolio, your art station page, something like that,

1009
00:58:16,887 --> 00:58:21,611
where it's specifically just art content, just your best work.

1010
00:58:23,258 --> 00:58:31,164
And then the final question is going back to the generalist versus specialization. When you work

1011
00:58:31,725 --> 00:58:37,869
on a big studio, my guess is that you also have a very open line of communication with your

1012
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:45,575
programmers or directors and stuff like that, right? Ideally. Hopefully, right? So my question

1013
00:58:45,615 --> 00:58:48,897
would be, wouldn't it be more efficient?

1014
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:58,043
If someone that has many skills show you that he can do, well, I can do 3D art, but due to, you know...

1015
00:58:59,293 --> 00:59:03,394
situation, I can also do, let's say, programming and stuff.

1016
00:59:03,714 --> 00:59:06,915
Normally when a big company is hiring for a position, they have

1017
00:59:06,955 --> 00:59:10,016
a very absolute need for that position. So let's say character

1018
00:59:10,076 --> 00:59:13,017
art. We need a character artist. It's great if a character

1019
00:59:13,057 --> 00:59:15,818
artist comes in that can do effects and concept art and

1020
00:59:15,898 --> 00:59:20,479
other things, but we don't want to see that until we see that

1021
00:59:20,879 --> 00:59:24,040
your character art portfolio is amazing and we want to hire you

1022
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,301
for that. So the rest is just bonus.

1023
00:59:28,406 --> 00:59:31,527
So you wouldn't communicate to say your programmer

1024
00:59:31,987 --> 00:59:34,647
and he'll be like, hey, by the way, I need a new programmer

1025
00:59:34,667 --> 00:59:39,849
because last one got sick or had a crash or something?

1026
00:59:39,889 --> 00:59:40,649
Nope, no.

1027
00:59:40,669 --> 00:59:41,689
All right, thank you very much.

1028
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:46,370
Hi, I was wondering if any of you have any advice

1029
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:48,730
for people trying to cater their portfolios

1030
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:53,111
to studios that are NDA and haven't released their title yet

1031
00:59:53,491 --> 00:59:56,052
specifically for art position, possibly tech artists,

1032
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:57,152
more art-oriented?

1033
00:59:59,019 --> 01:00:00,679
Wow, that's a tough one.

1034
01:00:00,699 --> 01:00:01,280
That's a tough one.

1035
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:03,121
So you haven't seen anything that they're doing?

1036
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:07,503
You don't know what it is that they're kind of doing?

1037
01:00:08,263 --> 01:00:08,724
That's tough.

1038
01:00:08,784 --> 01:00:14,427
I mean, again, I would just put together your best work, put together what you think is

1039
01:00:14,467 --> 01:00:18,009
good, what you enjoy doing, and if it's not a fit, they're probably not going to call

1040
01:00:18,049 --> 01:00:18,489
you back.

1041
01:00:18,789 --> 01:00:19,529
But if it's a fit...

1042
01:00:20,817 --> 01:00:23,059
You wouldn't be there anyway if it wasn't so

1043
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:26,022
You know you're kind of shooting in the dark a little bit

1044
01:00:26,162 --> 01:00:31,327
But you know yeah showing a strong point of view for what you want to do all day every day

1045
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:35,470
It's about probably your best bet yeah when we were stepping up for destiny

1046
01:00:35,490 --> 01:00:40,595
And we hadn't shown anything about the game to the world we were still like we needed people

1047
01:00:41,116 --> 01:00:45,360
It was a big game with a lot of work, but we couldn't tell people what we were working on

1048
01:00:46,981 --> 01:00:47,181
but

1049
01:00:48,229 --> 01:00:53,353
Generally, people who are applying were familiar with our previous titles and were delivering

1050
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:58,597
portfolios that were kind of in line with the nature of work that we did anyway.

1051
01:00:59,437 --> 01:01:03,160
So even though it's a little bit of a black box, you can kind of look to a company's track

1052
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:06,743
record and try to cater to the company rather than the project.

1053
01:01:08,242 --> 01:01:13,566
At that point, would it be okay to take a step back if you weren't sure for Bungie and Halo,

1054
01:01:13,706 --> 01:01:18,369
could you take a step back and be a little bit more generalist with what kind of art that you show in your portfolio?

1055
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:22,072
Would that be all right or is it better to just stick with your guns and be a specialist?

1056
01:01:22,092 --> 01:01:24,274
I think you could probably even guess too.

1057
01:01:24,374 --> 01:01:30,118
I mean with Bungie, even though Destiny is a million times different than Halo,

1058
01:01:30,398 --> 01:01:36,063
I mean I think you could probably guess that it's going to be in that realm of a game, right?

1059
01:01:36,123 --> 01:01:36,763
Versus like...

1060
01:01:37,853 --> 01:01:44,558
you know, you guys are making the new Skylanders or something like that. It's absolutely completely

1061
01:01:44,598 --> 01:01:49,381
different. I think it's kind of rare for a company to take such a hard turn.

1062
01:01:49,821 --> 01:01:56,566
We wouldn't have gone completely left turn and go cell shaded, funny animal games.

1063
01:01:56,626 --> 01:02:04,591
So no Snoopy games, huh? No. I'm a fan of the Snoopy. So, you know, again, it's a matter

1064
01:02:04,691 --> 01:02:05,851
of like sort of.

1065
01:02:06,627 --> 01:02:11,751
Checking out what the wheelhouse of that particular company is and sort of driving towards that

1066
01:02:12,751 --> 01:02:15,573
Due to time we can only take one more question

1067
01:02:15,593 --> 01:02:21,497
Thank you, so that is you okay? Hello

1068
01:02:23,939 --> 01:02:25,720
As was mentioned just a couple minutes ago

1069
01:02:27,161 --> 01:02:29,803
Character art is extremely hard to get into

1070
01:02:31,059 --> 01:02:35,981
What can a prospective character artist do to make their portfolio as competitive as

1071
01:02:36,061 --> 01:02:36,421
possible?

1072
01:02:36,441 --> 01:02:39,163
I'll ask that of you.

1073
01:02:39,303 --> 01:02:40,623
Oh, all right.

1074
01:02:41,944 --> 01:02:46,186
I mean, it's essentially what I've been saying, like all, you know, the whole hour.

1075
01:02:48,441 --> 01:02:54,909
I mean it's just quality, it's self-editing, it's having every piece that you have being

1076
01:02:54,929 --> 01:02:56,351
something that you're really, really proud of.

1077
01:02:56,371 --> 01:03:04,742
I mean to give you a rough stat, I have an opening for my company and I've had 500 plus

1078
01:03:04,922 --> 01:03:05,323
applicants.

1079
01:03:06,664 --> 01:03:09,365
you get a lot of people. You get concept artists, you get

1080
01:03:10,106 --> 01:03:12,747
sculptors, you get everything coming in. So there's a lot of

1081
01:03:13,307 --> 01:03:16,908
noise. You really have to stand out. What will make you stand

1082
01:03:17,048 --> 01:03:21,530
out is not being obnoxious, it's being like your professional,

1083
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:26,512
your work is really solid, it's hitting modern technology, it's

1084
01:03:26,592 --> 01:03:30,194
looking like it should be on Xbox One, PS4, something like

1085
01:03:30,234 --> 01:03:34,095
that. It already fits. Because you're competing with

1086
01:03:34,907 --> 01:03:36,988
everybody who is competing with your class. You know?

1087
01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:42,692
Well, thank you guys very much for this. And we're really

1088
01:03:42,732 --> 01:03:45,014
excited to be doing this talk and we hope to be here again

1089
01:03:45,034 --> 01:03:48,437
next year. Please be sure to fill out your online forms

1090
01:03:48,517 --> 01:03:52,279
or whatever. And also we'll be doing our portfolio room

1091
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:59,144
reviews in the next room, 132, which is that way. So we'll see

1092
01:03:59,184 --> 01:03:59,425
you there.
