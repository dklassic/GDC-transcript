1
00:00:05,454 --> 00:00:11,516
I'm Heli Salomaa. I'm a costume designer, and I'm here to talk about how I was integrated

2
00:00:11,616 --> 00:00:17,698
into the character pipeline of Remedy Entertainment's Control. Before I start, remember to turn

3
00:00:17,738 --> 00:00:23,280
off your noisemakers and remember to fill out the evaluation form after the session.

4
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:30,102
Control is Chessie Faden's story.

5
00:00:31,584 --> 00:00:35,126
It takes place in the headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Control,

6
00:00:35,507 --> 00:00:40,230
where Jessie uncovers the answers she seeks as she grows into the role of the director.

7
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:45,594
Remedy is known for narrative-driven cinematic single-player action games

8
00:00:45,815 --> 00:00:51,439
that have a strong lead character. This presentation is based on my work as a

9
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:54,701
costume artist on Control, which will be released this year.

10
00:00:56,768 --> 00:00:59,449
Before Kontroll, I had worked on costumes for live arts,

11
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:01,750
such as dance, circus, and theater,

12
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,271
and digital costumes in animation and VR.

13
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:09,712
In 2016, I wanted to write my master's thesis

14
00:01:09,772 --> 00:01:10,933
about costumes in games,

15
00:01:11,413 --> 00:01:13,514
and asked Remini if I could come work for them

16
00:01:13,694 --> 00:01:15,114
to see how they do things,

17
00:01:15,414 --> 00:01:18,235
and if I would be of any help in the character process.

18
00:01:19,895 --> 00:01:22,796
I ended up working on the costumes of Kontroll for two years

19
00:01:23,056 --> 00:01:25,397
and wrote the thesis about this collaboration.

20
00:01:27,484 --> 00:01:32,386
The main finding in the thesis was that the people who design characters' appearance for games

21
00:01:33,067 --> 00:01:36,748
and the people who design costumes for live arts have the same job.

22
00:01:38,269 --> 00:01:43,291
Both professions create characters from the inside of the story and concentrate on expressing

23
00:01:43,611 --> 00:01:50,474
the character's age, background, social status, and the time period, environment, and climate through appearance.

24
00:01:53,676 --> 00:01:55,837
Costume is often confused with fashion.

25
00:01:57,788 --> 00:02:03,594
Fashion designers design clothes for the general public and concentrate on the aesthetics features of clothing.

26
00:02:06,036 --> 00:02:11,061
Costume design is character specific and concentrates on the narrative features of clothing.

27
00:02:12,395 --> 00:02:15,297
It includes not only what the character is wearing and why,

28
00:02:15,857 --> 00:02:17,919
but also how the garment is worn

29
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:21,462
and how the character's previous actions, events in the story

30
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:26,025
or passing time have affected the quality and condition of the clothing.

31
00:02:27,006 --> 00:02:30,309
Costume designers also define how the characters have their hair

32
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:34,672
and if they have physical characteristics, such as tattoos or scars.

33
00:02:36,654 --> 00:02:40,177
This job description also applies to realistic character design.

34
00:02:42,392 --> 00:02:44,333
Despite the form of the visual narrative,

35
00:02:44,573 --> 00:02:47,913
the characters' appearance communicate information about the world

36
00:02:48,013 --> 00:02:49,393
where the narrative takes place.

37
00:02:50,574 --> 00:02:54,654
The main difference in designing the costumes for games or live arts is

38
00:02:55,235 --> 00:02:58,755
that the costume design is mostly connected to the physical human body.

39
00:03:00,435 --> 00:03:02,756
In live arts, the restrictions of costume design

40
00:03:02,896 --> 00:03:05,176
are connected to the reality and physical laws,

41
00:03:05,696 --> 00:03:09,397
while costume in games is restricted by the technology.

42
00:03:13,287 --> 00:03:17,589
The thesis and this presentation concentrate on games that are based on human characters

43
00:03:17,749 --> 00:03:21,450
and are either realistic or represent stylized realism,

44
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:26,271
since most of my work on Control was about adding realism through the costumes.

45
00:03:27,412 --> 00:03:31,753
This talk refers to my experience in making games that remedy as a costume artist,

46
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:36,055
and the utilized methods are considered through the character pipeline of Remedy

47
00:03:36,455 --> 00:03:39,696
and apply primarily on the Remedy's character process.

48
00:03:43,105 --> 00:03:54,148
During this session, I'll talk about how learning the similarities and differences of the costume production between game and film industry helped me to integrate into the process, the character process.

49
00:03:56,109 --> 00:04:00,050
I will also introduce three examples of costume work on Control.

50
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:10,172
The first two examples are based on pipelines familiar in game industry, but I will go them through from costume perspective and present my contribution to the process.

51
00:04:13,095 --> 00:04:17,140
The first example we'll look into is the development of the protagonist.

52
00:04:18,502 --> 00:04:20,825
Jessie's costume was based on live garments.

53
00:04:22,927 --> 00:04:29,295
With the second example, I will talk about how the costume construction solutions were communicated further in the production

54
00:04:29,715 --> 00:04:32,338
and how I supported the character artist's work.

55
00:04:34,462 --> 00:04:37,323
And finally, I will present the live action pipeline,

56
00:04:37,423 --> 00:04:39,824
which is basically the pipeline of live arts.

57
00:04:40,924 --> 00:04:43,284
There is integrated live footage in Remedy Games

58
00:04:43,425 --> 00:04:44,805
and during my time in the company,

59
00:04:45,005 --> 00:04:46,785
I did some traditional costume design

60
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,726
by dressing up the actors for these live shoots.

61
00:04:50,486 --> 00:04:53,567
I will use Dr. Darling's shoots as an example for this one.

62
00:04:57,372 --> 00:05:02,835
These slides will be posted online later and you are welcome to look at details at the website,

63
00:05:03,235 --> 00:05:07,177
but for now I want to point out a couple of things from the following charts.

64
00:05:08,718 --> 00:05:12,439
When I started working at Remedy, I had no idea how to make games.

65
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,142
My first challenge was to find out what is Remedy's character pipeline.

66
00:05:19,364 --> 00:05:23,988
By pipeline, I address the collection of methods of the different sections of the process

67
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:28,533
and the professionals who are involved with the visualisation of the characters.

68
00:05:29,414 --> 00:05:36,562
The sections are categorised on the left and on the right are the professionals responsible for those specific tasks.

69
00:05:37,903 --> 00:05:40,806
The second challenge was, how can I be involved?

70
00:05:44,156 --> 00:05:53,684
I made this pipeline comparison to figure out the similarities and differences of the character pipeline of Remedy and costume pipeline in live arts, which I'm familiar with.

71
00:05:54,965 --> 00:06:05,013
These processes of either fields are not as linear and defined as it might appear in these charts, but I simplified them for the research sake.

72
00:06:06,434 --> 00:06:11,358
First of all, what I found out was that the pre-productions of these two are very alike.

73
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,342
The pre-production starts with analysing the narrative,

74
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,104
whether it is a script or a character bio.

75
00:06:19,105 --> 00:06:22,588
After the script analysis, there are the stages of research,

76
00:06:22,848 --> 00:06:26,470
reference material search, and reference or mood boards,

77
00:06:26,951 --> 00:06:28,952
all identical in both pipelines.

78
00:06:29,893 --> 00:06:32,355
This all leads to visualising the character

79
00:06:32,455 --> 00:06:34,576
in a costume illustration or concept.

80
00:06:36,798 --> 00:06:39,640
The production phases, on the other hand, are very different.

81
00:06:41,153 --> 00:06:43,916
The production of a game character was all new for me,

82
00:06:44,076 --> 00:06:46,859
and I had to figure out how to contribute

83
00:06:47,059 --> 00:06:48,381
to this part of the process.

84
00:06:49,822 --> 00:06:52,385
What was also new were the technical restrictions

85
00:06:52,465 --> 00:06:54,767
of character production that sets frames

86
00:06:54,887 --> 00:06:57,990
to what type of clothing I can design for the characters.

87
00:07:01,033 --> 00:07:03,756
Also, the iteration loops formed a major difference.

88
00:07:04,714 --> 00:07:08,536
During control, sometimes the costume passed through the production phase,

89
00:07:08,716 --> 00:07:13,097
and after testing, ended up all the way back to my desk for a redesign.

90
00:07:13,657 --> 00:07:19,079
While in live arts, the iteration rotates mostly between rehearsals and costume adjustments.

91
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:26,642
In the end, I was involved with the entire character pipeline of Control.

92
00:07:27,563 --> 00:07:33,165
I worked as part of the character artist's team under the direction of the lead character artist Antti Puomia.

93
00:07:34,626 --> 00:07:40,513
In the pre-production I worked on the character analysis, research, reference boards and costume-based character concepts.

94
00:07:41,214 --> 00:07:47,522
Some new methods were integrated into the pipeline such as stress code and detail boards, but I'll talk about these later on.

95
00:07:49,025 --> 00:07:55,990
During production, I searched for both real and digital textile and clothing material for photo scan and reference purposes.

96
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:00,072
Character photo suits was a method adapted from live arts.

97
00:08:00,172 --> 00:08:01,754
I will get back to that one too.

98
00:08:02,994 --> 00:08:11,360
I manufactured clothing in Marvelous Designer and offered costume support for character artists and character technical artists when needed.

99
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:16,561
And here is how I was involved.

100
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:20,125
This is a recap of some of my tasks at Remedy.

101
00:08:20,425 --> 00:08:25,030
It's collected from my video diary, one second per day,

102
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,552
and it has peaks to each of the examples

103
00:08:27,592 --> 00:08:30,315
we will go through during the presentation.

104
00:08:45,417 --> 00:08:47,701
What are you going to do?

105
00:08:47,781 --> 00:08:52,110
What might it be?

106
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:42,770
You're supposed to leave that behind.

107
00:09:48,745 --> 00:09:48,966
War.

108
00:10:02,664 --> 00:10:03,264
She got.

109
00:10:12,395 --> 00:10:15,076
Before going through the examples, let's have a look at the game.

110
00:10:16,236 --> 00:10:19,197
In order to design the protagonist and the rest of the characters,

111
00:10:19,257 --> 00:10:21,678
we need to be familiar with the setting of the game

112
00:10:22,338 --> 00:10:24,579
and the environment the characters will be seen in.

113
00:10:25,819 --> 00:10:29,501
The story of Control takes place in the oldest house,

114
00:10:29,681 --> 00:10:32,642
which is the headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Control.

115
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:35,423
The oldest house is located in New York

116
00:10:35,663 --> 00:10:38,704
and it's built in the brutalistic architectural style.

117
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:57,500
August 4th, 1964. Bureau agents discover the oldest house, investigating an altered world event case in the New York City subway tunnels.

118
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:05,523
It's a place of power. From the outside, it looks like an ordinary building. A brutalist skyscraper.

119
00:11:07,464 --> 00:11:12,806
But inside, it breaks the laws of our reality. Unstable. Mad. Shifting.

120
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,642
There are rooms in the building where other dimensions leak in.

121
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,723
We call these rooms thresholds.

122
00:11:26,765 --> 00:11:30,006
There is a connection between our minds and the unknown,

123
00:11:30,526 --> 00:11:33,547
often hostile forces intruding on our world.

124
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:40,590
These forces gravitate toward everyday objects, a gun, a television,

125
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,931
a house with a reputation of being haunted.

126
00:11:46,948 --> 00:11:50,270
So somehow, we affect these events.

127
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,551
We're holding the key, but we don't have a clue

128
00:11:53,692 --> 00:11:54,732
on how to use it.

129
00:11:57,193 --> 00:12:00,715
We're dealing with dangerous, unknown forces here.

130
00:12:02,616 --> 00:12:04,617
What's the cause and what's the effect?

131
00:12:05,397 --> 00:12:06,457
Are we the starting point,

132
00:12:07,138 --> 00:12:09,079
or just the necessary evil in this?

133
00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:13,641
We're on a mission to find answers to these questions.

134
00:12:17,097 --> 00:12:27,161
die trying. This is Zachariah Trench, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Control.

135
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:43,767
As mentioned in the trailer, the environment is an ever-shifting supernatural location that

136
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:46,228
exists outside of the laws of reality.

137
00:12:47,338 --> 00:12:51,001
The FPC has created a combination of science and ritualism

138
00:12:51,381 --> 00:12:54,584
in order to stabilise some of the oldest house topography.

139
00:12:56,506 --> 00:12:58,788
The equipment of Breaux is old-fashioned.

140
00:12:59,408 --> 00:13:03,932
The supernatural environment demands tested and confirmed equipment

141
00:13:04,092 --> 00:13:06,034
that is more stable than the modern ones.

142
00:13:06,815 --> 00:13:13,300
Changing the gear might risk the stability of the unpredictable environment.

143
00:13:15,869 --> 00:13:23,260
In addition to studying supernatural elements that they actively seek out, contain, study and attempt to control within this interior,

144
00:13:23,961 --> 00:13:31,712
FBC also researches various forms of protection from supernatural phenomena to shield the employees.

145
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:39,273
The people who work in this environment, the employees of FPC,

146
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:44,257
are regular bureau staff such as office workers, maintenance and security.

147
00:13:45,338 --> 00:13:50,062
I created the bureau's dress code to frame the style of these NPCs in the game.

148
00:13:50,943 --> 00:13:57,428
I kept the style classic, timeless and generic to contrast to the unpredictable supernatural environment.

149
00:13:59,764 --> 00:14:03,306
As the equipment of brawl, also the office dress code is old-fashioned

150
00:14:03,687 --> 00:14:06,328
and leans back to the 60s to 80s office wear

151
00:14:06,669 --> 00:14:09,150
that was based on straight pants and collared shirts

152
00:14:09,591 --> 00:14:11,432
and at some office jobs still is.

153
00:14:12,673 --> 00:14:15,494
Most of Kontrol's costumes are based on these fundaments,

154
00:14:16,015 --> 00:14:19,057
except for maintenance and tactically demanding costumes.

155
00:14:19,857 --> 00:14:23,239
However, FPC employees always dress up appropriately

156
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,401
and treat their clothes with respect.

157
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,836
Here are a couple of NPC characters I made.

158
00:14:30,977 --> 00:14:35,781
Even the laboratory worker is based on a collared shirt and straight pants.

159
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:39,804
You might notice quality differences between these concepts.

160
00:14:40,585 --> 00:14:43,907
During the years in live arts I always drew everything by hand,

161
00:14:44,027 --> 00:14:47,290
but when I started at Remedy I had to learn how to use Photoshop.

162
00:14:48,211 --> 00:14:50,052
The lab guy is one of my earliest concepts.

163
00:14:53,822 --> 00:14:57,865
And we get to the first example, developing the protagonist.

164
00:15:03,109 --> 00:15:06,492
After I was familiar with the environment the characters will inhabit

165
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:10,395
and created the dress code to define the base style of NPC's look,

166
00:15:10,975 --> 00:15:14,558
I created a reference board to explore Jessie's style.

167
00:15:16,513 --> 00:15:22,554
The main idea here was to communicate Jessie's externality to brouhaha through style and materials.

168
00:15:23,354 --> 00:15:28,716
Jessie wears contemporary relatable street clothes and her materials are denim and jersey.

169
00:15:29,436 --> 00:15:31,476
She wears the only jeans in the building.

170
00:15:32,457 --> 00:15:39,598
In contrast, brouhaha clothes are made of durable and high quality materials and their style is old fashioned and well fitted.

171
00:15:40,698 --> 00:15:41,939
Jessie's not into fashion.

172
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:45,820
What matters for her more is the functionality of the clothing.

173
00:15:47,282 --> 00:15:50,845
When Jessie arrives at Breaux, she rebels against the dress code.

174
00:15:51,345 --> 00:15:54,947
Whatever she is given to wear, she rolls up sleeves if possible,

175
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:59,490
or keeps items of her own outfit, such as her jersey shirt or shoes.

176
00:16:00,231 --> 00:16:05,014
Her growth into the role of the director is also expressed through her appearance.

177
00:16:08,727 --> 00:16:15,112
During the pre-production of Control, I made around 130 costume variations of Jesse's outfit.

178
00:16:16,233 --> 00:16:22,097
Jesse's character was developed alongside the narrative, and during the process of defining our protagonist,

179
00:16:22,517 --> 00:16:26,901
the style went from official style to street style, then a bit over the top to punk,

180
00:16:27,581 --> 00:16:31,764
then to a soft casual look, before Jesse's current style started forming up.

181
00:16:32,968 --> 00:16:38,218
Actually the reference board of the previous slide was not the first but probably the fifth of a kind

182
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:43,347
and here it applies to the last two rows of costume variations.

183
00:16:46,443 --> 00:16:52,966
When I found the style that the team agreed with, I created this costume board for Jessie's life concepts.

184
00:16:53,787 --> 00:16:57,449
Based on the board, I bought actual clothes for costume fitting.

185
00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:02,531
At this point, we knew that when Courtney Hope, who acts Jessie, comes over,

186
00:17:02,931 --> 00:17:06,893
we will dress her up as Jessie and have a photoshoot with her in character.

187
00:17:09,123 --> 00:17:15,849
The clothes I bought based on the board I used to build up live concepts to test Jesse's outfit combinations.

188
00:17:16,489 --> 00:17:18,130
I made around 30 of these.

189
00:17:21,253 --> 00:17:27,198
I narrowed the selection of 30 down to five outfit combinations that were tested at the photoshoot on Kortni.

190
00:17:27,899 --> 00:17:35,565
There's me with the photographer Mikko Riikonen and lead character artist Antti Puomio at the shoots looking through the live concept variations.

191
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,552
During the same photo shoot where we tested the costumes,

192
00:17:41,612 --> 00:17:44,254
we took photos of Courtney in character.

193
00:17:46,776 --> 00:17:49,237
These in-character photos were further utilized

194
00:17:49,397 --> 00:17:50,238
in concept art.

195
00:17:53,521 --> 00:17:55,342
Based on the photo shoot's costume tests,

196
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:58,184
I defined the final outfit on the left.

197
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:00,886
Jessie went through some modifications

198
00:18:00,966 --> 00:18:02,728
due to visual and technical reasons

199
00:18:03,088 --> 00:18:04,229
after the final concept.

200
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:07,151
Here on the right, we have the final Jessie.

201
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:16,704
When the concept was confirmed, I moved on to manufacturing Jesse's jacket, which was highly handcrafted.

202
00:18:17,944 --> 00:18:24,208
First, I dyed the leather by hand. Here are the samples. I was exploring the tones between green and blue.

203
00:18:27,862 --> 00:18:34,307
Then the jacket was made to Courtney Hope's measurements at a seamstress, Anni Konttinen, according to the costume concept.

204
00:18:35,108 --> 00:18:42,595
After manufacturing, the jacket was distressed and moulded with steam and shoe polish to make it appear more worn.

205
00:18:45,938 --> 00:18:49,521
After the manufacturer distressing, the jacket was photo scanned.

206
00:18:52,475 --> 00:18:58,796
Each pattern piece of the jacket was photographed to transfer the handcrafted details accurately to the digital version.

207
00:19:01,837 --> 00:19:13,520
Since originally I had planned to give Jessie a scarf, I had kept the jacket's design very simple, but after giving up the scarf, the jacket needed some post detailing, so I added a zipper.

208
00:19:16,343 --> 00:19:19,747
When the jacket was ready, we had another photoshoot with Kortni.

209
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:23,650
This time it was for key art and motion reference material.

210
00:19:24,351 --> 00:19:25,972
There's Kortni doing the shield.

211
00:19:27,585 --> 00:19:30,908
We had these character photo shoots for every main character of Control.

212
00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:34,051
This photo is from Trench's photo shoots.

213
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,634
Trench is played by James McCaffrey.

214
00:19:37,835 --> 00:19:40,897
I designed and had manufactured all the game's main costumes.

215
00:19:41,338 --> 00:19:46,082
The costume supports the actor's work by helping the actor to internalize the character.

216
00:19:47,503 --> 00:19:52,487
Utilising an actor for their character exploration and recording it in photoshoots and live videos

217
00:19:52,948 --> 00:19:58,153
brought the character alive and helped us to define the co-created idea of the appearance

218
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:00,535
and the personality of the character.

219
00:20:01,396 --> 00:20:05,259
Basing the character on live material gives it connections to reality.

220
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:13,595
What we got from the photo shoots were the photo, motion and character references of the actual character in the costume,

221
00:20:14,135 --> 00:20:20,559
which were further utilised by concept artists, character technical artists and for the internal communication.

222
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,262
The costumes produced for the shoots were later photo scanned.

223
00:20:27,563 --> 00:20:30,545
And here is how the jacket currently looks like in the game.

224
00:20:46,051 --> 00:20:50,855
Then we have the example number two, design communication in production.

225
00:20:51,576 --> 00:20:56,480
It's about how I communicated the costume information further to character artists.

226
00:20:59,663 --> 00:21:02,886
In this example I will present one of Jessie's outfit variations.

227
00:21:03,546 --> 00:21:08,551
I started with a reference board again and explored the style and materials of the outfit.

228
00:21:11,528 --> 00:21:15,070
After iterations, this concept was confirmed by the team.

229
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,991
I designed this outfit to emphasize

230
00:21:18,031 --> 00:21:20,812
the brutalistic architecture of the oldest house.

231
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,874
I thought of it as the building in a costume form.

232
00:21:26,835 --> 00:21:29,437
After the concept, I proceeded into detail board

233
00:21:29,597 --> 00:21:30,717
for character artists.

234
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,279
It is meant to give the character artists all

235
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:35,440
the costume-related information they need,

236
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,841
such as material volumes, attachment details,

237
00:21:39,062 --> 00:21:40,162
and the outfit layers.

238
00:21:43,274 --> 00:21:47,918
Here is another detail board example and another one of Jesse's outfit options.

239
00:21:48,678 --> 00:21:53,162
The difference to the previous one is that the concept here is not by me, but by Ville

240
00:21:53,202 --> 00:21:53,622
Kinnunen.

241
00:21:54,998 --> 00:21:58,702
One of my tasks was to define concept artists' character concepts,

242
00:21:59,143 --> 00:22:02,306
since the construction of the costumes they represented

243
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:03,848
were not always exact.

244
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:08,113
I translated the concept into seams or layers of clothing

245
00:22:08,673 --> 00:22:12,578
and defined the attachments, materials and other details of the outfit

246
00:22:12,678 --> 00:22:14,780
by paint over and photo reference.

247
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:19,543
I solved the questions of how to wear it and can the character move in it.

248
00:22:20,443 --> 00:22:23,165
The costumes needed to be realistic and make sense.

249
00:22:23,865 --> 00:22:27,267
Also a narrative connection was created. The costume needed a function.

250
00:22:30,568 --> 00:22:34,030
After the detail boards I created the costumes in Marvelous Designer.

251
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:41,073
The program is perfect for design communication since it is based on actual clothes manufacturer that I'm familiar with.

252
00:22:42,447 --> 00:22:47,129
So to support character artists' work, I produce either live clothing for Photoscan

253
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:52,832
or digital clothing in Marvellous Designer. Detail boards were made for the more complex

254
00:22:52,912 --> 00:22:58,354
costumes that were not manufactured in reality. All the actually manufactured

255
00:22:58,414 --> 00:23:01,696
costumes function as detail references themselves.

256
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:06,210
During production, I sat at the character artist's room

257
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:08,231
and had a rack of clothes next to my desk.

258
00:23:08,631 --> 00:23:11,052
So we could go through costume construction details

259
00:23:11,092 --> 00:23:12,953
with live clothing when necessary.

260
00:23:13,913 --> 00:23:16,034
I also prepared textures by photographing

261
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:17,734
and tiling textile materials.

262
00:23:19,935 --> 00:23:23,676
And here is the final 3D model by Daniel Garcia.

263
00:23:27,397 --> 00:23:29,318
Then we have our last example,

264
00:23:30,058 --> 00:23:31,778
the pipeline of live action.

265
00:23:35,563 --> 00:23:43,746
I'm starting with this reference board again to emphasise that the starting point for each costume, whether digital or real, is always the same.

266
00:23:45,066 --> 00:23:48,987
Here is the exploration for Dr Darling based on his character bio.

267
00:23:50,427 --> 00:24:02,911
Darling's character pipeline followed the costume production of Live Arts. I purposefully chose materials hard to render because we didn't have to care about the 3D model this time. This costume only appears in live footage.

268
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:11,352
At first I bought and put together the wardrobe of Dr. Darling based on the reference board.

269
00:24:12,012 --> 00:24:17,495
Then I photographed each of the outfit variations and defined how is he wearing them and what does

270
00:24:17,575 --> 00:24:25,538
it tell of the character and the situation. Then I made the script analysis and scene breakdown

271
00:24:25,658 --> 00:24:30,901
and decided which outfit he will be wearing in each scene and how is he wearing it.

272
00:24:34,102 --> 00:24:35,383
And then we had the shoots.

273
00:24:37,096 --> 00:24:39,718
On the left, Sam is directing Matthew Perretta,

274
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:42,261
who plays Dr. Darling, and on the right,

275
00:24:42,501 --> 00:24:44,302
shots of how it looks in the game.

276
00:24:48,366 --> 00:24:49,867
And that was my last example.

277
00:24:50,007 --> 00:24:51,248
It's time to summarize.

278
00:24:52,229 --> 00:24:54,571
I have shown three ways of how Costume Designer

279
00:24:54,611 --> 00:24:57,254
has contributed to the game development of Control,

280
00:24:57,854 --> 00:25:00,817
from developing a protagonist to helping the production,

281
00:25:00,977 --> 00:25:03,159
and finally, live action shoots.

282
00:25:05,642 --> 00:25:13,465
What comes to characters' appearance, people who design characters for games are doing the same thing as costume designers, but digitally.

283
00:25:15,606 --> 00:25:25,470
In Control, I got to do both. I used live arts costume design practices and digital methods to develop realistic characters and support game developers' work.

284
00:25:29,135 --> 00:25:34,685
Last year I started lecturing about digital costume in various costume study programs in Finland

285
00:25:35,346 --> 00:25:40,054
and Aalto University has started integrating digital methods into the costume degree.

286
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:46,656
In addition to preparing costume designers to work on the digital characters in film and animation,

287
00:25:47,277 --> 00:25:55,884
the aim is to provide future costume designers skills that allow them to offer costume support in game development and other digital productions.

288
00:25:57,085 --> 00:25:59,047
So, let's collaborate!

289
00:26:01,329 --> 00:26:01,650
Thank you!

290
00:26:11,981 --> 00:26:17,165
Instead of taking the questions here, I would like to continue the session in one of the wrap-up rooms,

291
00:26:17,665 --> 00:26:23,229
and I actually have a request for you. I'm looking to continue my research, and since I only have

292
00:26:24,009 --> 00:26:29,413
experience from one company and one project, I would love to hear examples from the industry,

293
00:26:29,613 --> 00:26:33,656
like other examples. Who are the costume responsible people of your company,

294
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:37,038
and what is the role of costume in your character pipelines?

295
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:44,184
I'm aware of the collaborations between costume designers and game industry in LA Noire and GTA V,

296
00:26:44,564 --> 00:26:49,709
but I would love to hear more. So if you would like to share any costume related information,

297
00:26:49,829 --> 00:26:53,712
please contact me through the email or join me to the wrap-up room

298
00:26:54,192 --> 00:26:59,196
just across the hall where I'll also answer the questions. Thank you.
