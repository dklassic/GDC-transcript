1
00:00:06,202 --> 00:00:19,197
Hello. Welcome. So, that's certainly live. Welcome to looking back and moving forward

2
00:00:19,197 --> 00:00:24,163
with Pillars of Eternity. I'm your host, Josh Sawyer.

3
00:00:24,815 --> 00:00:26,836
There's a few things I should say before we start.

4
00:00:26,836 --> 00:00:30,117
First is, please silence your cell phones

5
00:00:30,117 --> 00:00:31,978
if you happen to be, have not done that already.

6
00:00:31,978 --> 00:00:35,879
Also, you should be receiving an email about a survey

7
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:36,780
for this session.

8
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,620
Please fill them out.

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,462
It helps GDC determine if my talk is good or a pile of trash

10
00:00:41,462 --> 00:00:43,483
and if I should never, ever be invited back again.

11
00:00:45,691 --> 00:00:49,434
So let's talk about what this talk is about.

12
00:00:49,434 --> 00:00:51,716
It is about Pillars of Eternity, in fact.

13
00:00:51,716 --> 00:00:53,918
I'm trying to make it about more than just

14
00:00:53,918 --> 00:00:57,401
being a post-mortem of how the game went, what we did right

15
00:00:57,401 --> 00:00:59,102
and what we did wrong.

16
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:02,205
It's trying to broaden the focus more to retro-styled games

17
00:01:02,205 --> 00:01:04,967
overall, why they appeal to gamers,

18
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:06,188
some of the inherent dangers that

19
00:01:06,188 --> 00:01:08,070
come with making a retro-classic game that

20
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,212
has a lot of very passionate fans from the beginning,

21
00:01:11,212 --> 00:01:12,994
and about our learning experiences

22
00:01:12,994 --> 00:01:13,755
in making this game.

23
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:18,285
By the way, Facebook reminded me that four years ago today, we

24
00:01:18,285 --> 00:01:21,286
recorded the video for, this is a picture from the video for

25
00:01:21,286 --> 00:01:24,986
our Kickstarter campaign for Pillars of Eternity, so that

26
00:01:24,986 --> 00:01:30,908
little angel is long gone. So who am I? I am Josh Sawyer. I am

27
00:01:30,908 --> 00:01:34,568
the design director at Obsidian Entertainment. Of particular

28
00:01:34,568 --> 00:01:38,469
relevance to this talk, I was the director and system designer

29
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:41,049
on Pillars of Eternity, and I was the director and system

30
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:43,050
designer on Fall at New Vegas. And...

31
00:01:43,633 --> 00:01:50,076
one of the expansions. Way back when at Black Isle Studios, I got my start as a level designer

32
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:55,779
on Icewind Dale, which was my first introduction to designing for Infinity Engine style games,

33
00:01:55,779 --> 00:02:01,261
and then later I was the lead designer on Icewind Dale 2. And I got into gaming in part

34
00:02:01,261 --> 00:02:05,483
because I've been playing tabletop games for about 30 years, so my love affair with this

35
00:02:05,483 --> 00:02:06,783
style of game goes back a long way.

36
00:02:08,714 --> 00:02:11,835
I've talked a lot about Pillars of Eternity in the past.

37
00:02:11,835 --> 00:02:14,576
Hopefully you're familiar with it.

38
00:02:14,576 --> 00:02:17,017
If you're not, it was a Kickstarter-backed project.

39
00:02:17,017 --> 00:02:18,898
We had about 77,000 backers and raised about $4 million.

40
00:02:18,898 --> 00:02:21,299
It was very, very successful.

41
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:26,421
We did not think making such a game would be possible at all until Double Fine Adventure

42
00:02:26,421 --> 00:02:27,721
launched on Kickstarter.

43
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:31,543
Then we decided, no, we definitely have to make a game like this.

44
00:02:31,543 --> 00:02:36,745
It took a while to get our owners convinced that this was a good idea, but they relented.

45
00:02:37,105 --> 00:02:40,347
And we decided that we would make an Infinity Engine style game.

46
00:02:40,347 --> 00:02:44,969
We wanted it to be a combination of elements from Icewind Dale, Baldur's Gate, and Planescape

47
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:46,190
Torment.

48
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:52,093
We wanted it to be Forgotten Realms-y and AD&DE, so similar to the Forgotten Realms

49
00:02:52,093 --> 00:02:57,336
setting, similar to the Dungeons and Dragons rule set, without exactly copying them, because,

50
00:02:57,336 --> 00:02:58,677
well, we don't have the rights to those.

51
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:03,215
The Kickstarter campaign was very successful very quickly.

52
00:03:03,215 --> 00:03:08,764
We really, a lot of people don't believe us when we say this, but we did not, we were

53
00:03:08,764 --> 00:03:11,448
not sure that it was going to be successful.

54
00:03:11,448 --> 00:03:14,413
Our original goal was 1.1 million dollars, that was reached in 27 hours.

55
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:19,991
And at the end of the campaign, it was, I think, 3.9.

56
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,293
So very successful, very quickly.

57
00:03:22,293 --> 00:03:24,594
And we had to do a lot of seat-of-our-pants design

58
00:03:24,594 --> 00:03:26,976
for things like stretch goals, which wound up

59
00:03:26,976 --> 00:03:29,137
being a little bit more than we could handle

60
00:03:29,137 --> 00:03:29,818
in terms of development.

61
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:30,838
But we'll get to that.

62
00:03:32,457 --> 00:03:35,019
So what's the appeal of retro gaming anyway?

63
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:37,280
There are three things I'll talk about here.

64
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,021
One is nostalgia.

65
00:03:38,021 --> 00:03:39,962
That's one of the biggest ones.

66
00:03:39,962 --> 00:03:41,303
It's about passion.

67
00:03:41,303 --> 00:03:43,084
It's about a longing for a time where

68
00:03:43,084 --> 00:03:44,745
we remember playing the games that we loved

69
00:03:44,745 --> 00:03:46,226
and how great that made us feel.

70
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,067
It's about the challenge presented

71
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:49,528
by a lot of older games.

72
00:03:49,528 --> 00:03:51,549
You can find games that are still challenging

73
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:53,951
that are made today, but it's not as common

74
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:56,252
since gaming has a broader fan base now.

75
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:02,203
And it's about wild cards, which is sort of the more human element and wacky things that

76
00:04:02,203 --> 00:04:06,928
we as human being developers wind up putting in our games that in march of time and the

77
00:04:06,928 --> 00:04:10,151
polishing of development has kind of erased a lot of.

78
00:04:11,121 --> 00:04:12,062
First, let's talk about nostalgia.

79
00:04:12,062 --> 00:04:16,346
These are images that are very nostalgic for me,

80
00:04:16,346 --> 00:04:18,908
because I grew up in the 80s and early 90s

81
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:22,652
playing role-playing games like the original Bard's Tale.

82
00:04:22,652 --> 00:04:24,573
I played all the Gold Box games from SSI.

83
00:04:24,573 --> 00:04:27,616
Those were the AD&D games set in the Forgotten Realms

84
00:04:27,616 --> 00:04:29,498
and the Dragonlance settings, which were a lot of fun.

85
00:04:29,498 --> 00:04:32,501
And also Darklands, which is a game that almost no one has

86
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:33,762
ever heard of.

87
00:04:33,762 --> 00:04:35,904
But it's a very cool historical role-playing game

88
00:04:35,904 --> 00:04:37,445
set in the Holy Roman Empire.

89
00:04:37,705 --> 00:04:38,846
and it's a lot of fun.

90
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:42,047
And whenever I see pictures like this, it draws me back to that time,

91
00:04:42,047 --> 00:04:43,868
makes me very excited and passionate.

92
00:04:43,868 --> 00:04:46,609
I forget all the bad things about those games.

93
00:04:46,609 --> 00:04:48,050
I just remember all the good things,

94
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,131
and I wish someone would make more games like that.

95
00:04:50,131 --> 00:04:53,493
And that's the way people feel when they see a lot of the Infinity Engine games,

96
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,353
is that feeling of nostalgia,

97
00:04:55,353 --> 00:04:58,015
remembering how fun it was and how much they loved those games.

98
00:04:59,422 --> 00:05:01,423
And the second part is challenge.

99
00:05:01,423 --> 00:05:04,005
Like I said, you can still find games being made today

100
00:05:04,005 --> 00:05:07,407
that are really emphasizing a very strong difficulty curve,

101
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,209
things like Dark Souls, games like that,

102
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:13,172
especially since we have a lot more smaller developers making

103
00:05:13,172 --> 00:05:15,373
more focused games for niche audiences.

104
00:05:15,373 --> 00:05:17,234
You can find very challenging games out there.

105
00:05:17,615 --> 00:05:21,577
But role-playing games have also broadened their appeal and their fan base,

106
00:05:21,577 --> 00:05:25,260
and you see a lot of games that are targeted for a very low level of difficulty,

107
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,381
a very shallow learning curve.

108
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:30,663
And when people think back to games like Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale,

109
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:35,607
they think of very, very challenging fights that might have taken them hours

110
00:05:35,607 --> 00:05:37,928
and a lot of cursing and reloading to get through.

111
00:05:39,247 --> 00:05:41,667
The last thing are wild cards and this is sort of what I said

112
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:45,088
about human beings develop these games and when we were younger

113
00:05:45,088 --> 00:05:47,308
we put things in these games that when we look back at we

114
00:05:47,308 --> 00:05:51,629
kind of cringe. They're rough edges and goofy things, things

115
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:53,770
like Noober. I don't know if you guys remember Noober from

116
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,310
Baldur's Gate. He was an NPC that would approach you and he

117
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,891
would not stop talking to you and it was sort of like coaxing

118
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:02,832
you to kill him. Very, very obnoxious character but people

119
00:06:02,832 --> 00:06:05,653
still have fond memories of this guy because he's just a wild and

120
00:06:05,653 --> 00:06:09,193
wacky dude and then things like the golden pantaloons.

121
00:06:09,273 --> 00:06:12,137
goofy clothing item that you can find in Baldur's Gate.

122
00:06:12,137 --> 00:06:15,982
So, the modern development process in a lot of cases,

123
00:06:15,982 --> 00:06:17,804
especially with large development teams,

124
00:06:17,804 --> 00:06:20,268
it kind of files over the edges of these human elements

125
00:06:20,268 --> 00:06:22,370
that people, they actually find very endearing

126
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,775
because they show that people have fun making games.

127
00:06:25,775 --> 00:06:28,118
That's one of the reasons why we started making games.

128
00:06:29,915 --> 00:06:33,218
So let's talk about the, some of the dangers of making a retro

129
00:06:33,218 --> 00:06:36,301
revival game. You can hit the wrong targets. You can just

130
00:06:36,301 --> 00:06:38,523
focus on the wrong things. You look at all the things that go

131
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,825
into a game and you spend your time working on the things that

132
00:06:40,825 --> 00:06:42,447
no one gives a shit about.

133
00:06:43,017 --> 00:06:43,537
That's bad.

134
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:46,658
You can design for a very tiny niche.

135
00:06:46,658 --> 00:06:49,519
We sort of admit that we are designing for a niche audience.

136
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,339
We're not designing for everybody, clearly.

137
00:06:51,339 --> 00:06:53,240
We're not even designing for most gamers.

138
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,940
We're designing for a smaller subset of people.

139
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,661
But within that niche, there are even

140
00:06:57,661 --> 00:06:59,741
tinier and tinier niches of people

141
00:06:59,741 --> 00:07:03,402
that are more interested in very, very narrow elements.

142
00:07:03,402 --> 00:07:06,463
If you over-design toward one tiny niche,

143
00:07:06,463 --> 00:07:09,123
you will never broaden your appeal at all,

144
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:11,104
which can also be bad because you presumably

145
00:07:11,104 --> 00:07:12,864
want to continue making games.

146
00:07:13,704 --> 00:07:15,105
You can also update too much.

147
00:07:15,105 --> 00:07:19,226
You can look at everything and say, you know what, let's fix and update all of this stuff.

148
00:07:19,226 --> 00:07:20,987
Some of that stuff you don't need to touch at all.

149
00:07:20,987 --> 00:07:22,267
You can just leave it alone.

150
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:23,108
It's totally fine.

151
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:27,169
So you can be careful and just say, you know what, leave that alone.

152
00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:31,571
Let's focus on things that really need to be improved and not, you know, not change

153
00:07:31,571 --> 00:07:32,111
everything.

154
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:38,621
And the last part is missing the soul. This is a very ephemeral, feels-based thing, but it's very important.

155
00:07:38,621 --> 00:07:45,583
It's possibly the most important thing, because again, the reason why you get a lot of people interested in these sort of retro-revival games in the first place

156
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:48,484
is because they're very passionate about the game itself.

157
00:07:49,227 --> 00:07:51,871
And if it doesn't really have the feeling of those games,

158
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:54,955
if it doesn't evoke the sort of nostalgia

159
00:07:54,955 --> 00:07:56,757
that you're looking for, you fail.

160
00:07:56,757 --> 00:07:59,540
You can even make a good game that

161
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,683
is sort of good to some people, but you're

162
00:08:01,683 --> 00:08:03,886
sort of making it for an audience in the first place.

163
00:08:03,886 --> 00:08:06,229
And if you miss that, then you've missed the point.

164
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:12,974
Soul is elusive. So let's talk about soul, which is this very ephemeral thing.

165
00:08:12,974 --> 00:08:17,077
When people remember the things that they love, their memory can be selective,

166
00:08:17,077 --> 00:08:19,139
they can gloss over a lot of things,

167
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:22,582
and most of what they remember is their emotional attachment to it,

168
00:08:22,582 --> 00:08:24,363
and little things that stick out to them.

169
00:08:25,043 --> 00:08:28,426
The individual elements that go into it contribute to the whole picture.

170
00:08:28,426 --> 00:08:31,809
So when you modify things, you have to be very careful about what you're modifying.

171
00:08:31,809 --> 00:08:35,953
You could tweak one tiny thing that turns out to be a very key component of what made

172
00:08:35,953 --> 00:08:37,835
that something very cool.

173
00:08:37,835 --> 00:08:42,459
And ultimately, the spirit of something is more important than actually getting it technically

174
00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:42,719
accurate.

175
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:45,780
And in many cases, it's healthier if you're trying to modernize a game.

176
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:50,643
The example, I'm wearing my Ducati shirt today, I'm glad I packed it, because I'm going to

177
00:08:50,643 --> 00:08:53,604
talk about how Ducati, a motorcycle manufacturer, updated.

178
00:08:53,604 --> 00:09:01,187
The bike on the left is Mike Halewood's Isle of Man TT bike from 1978, and the bike on

179
00:09:01,187 --> 00:09:03,688
the right is a mid-2000s Sport Classic 1000.

180
00:09:03,688 --> 00:09:06,430
They look fairly similar.

181
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:10,753
but they're not actually all that similar, but they capture the soul of the old bike. And

182
00:09:10,753 --> 00:09:15,618
that's why that bike immediately sold out and why I can never find one for a good price and I'm

183
00:09:15,618 --> 00:09:20,282
going to be mad for the rest of my life about it. But it goes to show that the spirit of the

184
00:09:20,282 --> 00:09:24,906
thing is what's important. It's less important than the exact specific details. So let's

185
00:09:24,906 --> 00:09:30,771
talk about some of the things we did in Pillars of Eternity and what went right and what went

186
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:31,492
very not right.

187
00:09:32,508 --> 00:09:37,810
We decided from the beginning that we were going to be making 2D environments from an isometric rendered perspective.

188
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:41,332
That was a core component of all the Infinity Engine games.

189
00:09:41,332 --> 00:09:43,432
We knew we were going to raise the resolution a lot,

190
00:09:43,432 --> 00:09:47,053
but we were still going to hand touch most of our environments because we did a lot of...

191
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:51,155
After an environment would be rendered, we'd have 2D artists go back and touch them up.

192
00:09:51,155 --> 00:09:55,776
And that we were also going to try to add in a 3D lighting element, which was challenging.

193
00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:00,672
And I covered that in a little talk I did a few years ago.

194
00:10:00,672 --> 00:10:03,014
But basically, we managed to get 3D lighting

195
00:10:03,014 --> 00:10:06,155
into a 2D environment, and it was great.

196
00:10:06,155 --> 00:10:07,256
And a lot of the art that we looked

197
00:10:07,256 --> 00:10:10,717
at in terms of our inspiration was from the second edition

198
00:10:10,717 --> 00:10:11,118
AD&D era.

199
00:10:11,118 --> 00:10:15,160
So that, for me, is artists like Larry Elmore, Jeff Easley,

200
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,581
Keith Parkinson, Clyde Caldwell, Fred Fields, and Gerald Brom,

201
00:10:18,581 --> 00:10:19,602
also just known as Brom.

202
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:24,544
Overall, those artists used less saturated palettes

203
00:10:24,544 --> 00:10:26,385
than a lot of contemporary fantasy artists.

204
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:29,786
and relatively realistic weapons and armor.

205
00:10:29,786 --> 00:10:32,451
So they look, you know, they're not, they don't really look historical,

206
00:10:32,451 --> 00:10:35,516
but they're a little more on the subdued side, especially when compared

207
00:10:35,516 --> 00:10:37,119
to a lot of contemporary fantasy art.

208
00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:42,632
Here are a few key images that we looked at when we were looking at our style.

209
00:10:42,632 --> 00:10:46,994
The one on the left is by Larry Elmore, it's from the second edition player's handbook.

210
00:10:46,994 --> 00:10:50,576
The style of the character's weapons and armor is not realistic.

211
00:10:50,576 --> 00:10:54,779
It's slightly fantastic, but the proportions are still semi-realistic.

212
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:59,501
And the palette overall for both of the images, both Keith Parkinson and Larry Elmore, is

213
00:10:59,501 --> 00:11:00,242
relatively subdued.

214
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:05,024
You don't get a lot of really intense colors like you might see in a lot of contemporary

215
00:11:05,024 --> 00:11:05,405
fantasy art.

216
00:11:06,554 --> 00:11:08,636
And we wanted to capture the classic isometric look

217
00:11:08,636 --> 00:11:09,437
and feel.

218
00:11:09,437 --> 00:11:10,838
And as I'll show in the next image,

219
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:15,001
we didn't exactly emulate what we did in the first games,

220
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:16,483
but we came close.

221
00:11:16,483 --> 00:11:17,904
Baldur's Gate 2 in Icewind Dale.

222
00:11:17,904 --> 00:11:20,866
Baldur's Gate 2, that's a straight render.

223
00:11:20,866 --> 00:11:23,729
The image from Icewind Dale, it was heavily painted over.

224
00:11:23,729 --> 00:11:25,330
That's something that Black Isle did

225
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,392
that I don't think Bioware really did at all.

226
00:11:27,392 --> 00:11:30,635
At Black Isle, we usually did a lot of painting on our images

227
00:11:30,635 --> 00:11:32,997
after we rendered them and got in a lot of cool painterly

228
00:11:32,997 --> 00:11:33,497
details.

229
00:11:35,035 --> 00:11:37,237
So for Pillars of Eternity's isometric style,

230
00:11:37,237 --> 00:11:40,800
we wanted to add dynamic lighting.

231
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,642
Of course, we raised the resolution quite a bit.

232
00:11:43,642 --> 00:11:47,225
And we used a lower angle for how we rendered exteriors.

233
00:11:47,225 --> 00:11:50,608
If you look back at this image and the angle that we used,

234
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:56,370
versus this image. This image, it's actually lower. Most players don't really notice it because it's a

235
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,871
I think it's only like a seven and a half a degree difference

236
00:11:58,871 --> 00:12:03,432
But what it did it is allowed us to emphasize a lot of vertical structures that you see in exteriors

237
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:06,833
And since you don't necessarily get a lot of tight corridors

238
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:13,735
You don't wind up occluding the characters very much. When you go into interiors the camera actually goes up seven and a half degrees

239
00:12:13,935 --> 00:12:14,936
players didn't really notice it.

240
00:12:14,936 --> 00:12:16,056
So that's an example of something

241
00:12:16,056 --> 00:12:19,859
where we didn't actually emulate it exactly,

242
00:12:19,859 --> 00:12:21,661
but it created the experience that we wanted to.

243
00:12:21,661 --> 00:12:23,442
Character art was a little more mixed.

244
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:26,225
We decided right away we're going

245
00:12:26,225 --> 00:12:28,967
to use realistic proportions for things,

246
00:12:28,967 --> 00:12:32,049
make them more sort of in the style of second edition AD&D.

247
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:35,292
But those realistic proportions made characters hard to read.

248
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:37,433
I mean, there's a reason why a lot of game artists.

249
00:12:37,573 --> 00:12:41,315
exaggerate features, whether it's armor or body proportions on characters,

250
00:12:41,315 --> 00:12:45,278
it's because when they're very small on the screen, you want to be able to read them very easily.

251
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:49,160
It's also why they tend to use a lot of saturated and contrasting colors,

252
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,761
because it makes characters a lot easier to read when they're very small.

253
00:12:51,761 --> 00:12:55,543
But we committed to doing that, and so we ran into some challenges.

254
00:12:56,284 --> 00:13:00,546
And then because we did not have a level of detail system, when those, you know, simple

255
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:05,309
little teeny characters got blown up on your inventory screen, the details look kind of

256
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:06,029
poor and clumsy.

257
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:10,592
So if you look at the scale armor on Adair, the scales are really big and kind of clunky

258
00:13:10,592 --> 00:13:14,474
looking and we did that so they would read at a very small resolution, but then they

259
00:13:14,474 --> 00:13:18,717
look kind of goofy when you see them in game and people criticize that, which they were

260
00:13:18,717 --> 00:13:19,377
fair to criticize.

261
00:13:19,377 --> 00:13:23,839
And it was also very frustrating for our character artists who always love building the most

262
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,160
complex things they possibly can.

263
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,632
So looking back on how we handled things,

264
00:13:28,632 --> 00:13:31,134
the art overall was well-received,

265
00:13:31,134 --> 00:13:33,556
but the environments were criticized for being too static.

266
00:13:33,556 --> 00:13:35,218
So we had updated a few elements of them,

267
00:13:35,218 --> 00:13:36,479
but they were still essentially 2D renders,

268
00:13:36,479 --> 00:13:38,501
and they didn't have a lot of dynamic elements in them.

269
00:13:38,501 --> 00:13:41,083
And people also criticized that the characters

270
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,304
weren't detailed enough.

271
00:13:42,344 --> 00:13:44,765
Character customization is something that people really

272
00:13:44,765 --> 00:13:45,525
enjoy in these games.

273
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:47,706
And so if you can't really deliver on that

274
00:13:47,706 --> 00:13:49,007
and make the characters look good,

275
00:13:49,007 --> 00:13:50,108
it's disappointing for people.

276
00:13:50,108 --> 00:13:52,108
So in the future, things that we're looking to do

277
00:13:52,108 --> 00:13:55,770
are improve the dynamic elements, the lighting,

278
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,611
shadows, dynamic foliage.

279
00:13:57,611 --> 00:13:59,752
We actually tried a dynamic foliage test early

280
00:13:59,752 --> 00:14:02,133
on Pillars of Eternity, and we just couldn't figure it out.

281
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,031
Dynamic weather is something that a lot of players

282
00:14:06,031 --> 00:14:07,752
sort of expect to see in a lot of games now,

283
00:14:07,752 --> 00:14:09,794
and dynamic cloth, which we used a little bit of pillars,

284
00:14:09,794 --> 00:14:10,974
but we want to use more of.

285
00:14:10,974 --> 00:14:14,416
The lesson there is that vintage style in a game

286
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,798
you can still improve upon with new features.

287
00:14:16,798 --> 00:14:20,400
We want to use our LOD system to create higher resolution

288
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,821
and detailed character models, and also

289
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:25,082
physically-based rendering to improve material quality

290
00:14:25,082 --> 00:14:25,783
and things like that.

291
00:14:25,783 --> 00:14:27,323
Again, features that players expect

292
00:14:27,323 --> 00:14:29,605
to see in contemporary games.

293
00:14:32,357 --> 00:14:37,761
User interface and experience is a very big, big part of how

294
00:14:37,761 --> 00:14:40,002
people sort of attach to these classic games.

295
00:14:40,002 --> 00:14:42,164
Interface design was very different in the 90s

296
00:14:42,164 --> 00:14:44,085
and the early 2000s, if you recall.

297
00:14:44,085 --> 00:14:46,706
We decided right away that we were

298
00:14:46,706 --> 00:14:50,909
going to use a skeuomorphic GUI, which I'll get to in a bit.

299
00:14:50,909 --> 00:14:54,331
But it's a GUI style that was common to all the Infinity

300
00:14:54,331 --> 00:14:54,732
Engine games.

301
00:14:55,155 --> 00:15:00,979
We wanted to use similar hotkeys and a layout that borrowed from Icewind Dale 2 and Planescape

302
00:15:00,979 --> 00:15:01,459
Torment.

303
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:04,040
We had to sort of pick a layout style that we wanted to do for our HUD.

304
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:09,783
And we determined that we would try to mimic cursors, icon style, but that we didn't have

305
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,064
time for item sketches.

306
00:15:11,064 --> 00:15:16,067
Item sketches were in, I think, all the Infinity Engine games, and a lot of people remembered

307
00:15:16,067 --> 00:15:19,769
and enjoyed them, and they missed them because we didn't include them.

308
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:20,409
And I'll get to that in a bit.

309
00:15:22,563 --> 00:15:25,765
So here are interfaces from all five of the Infinity Engine

310
00:15:25,765 --> 00:15:25,885
games.

311
00:15:25,885 --> 00:15:28,005
As you can see, they're all skeuomorphic,

312
00:15:28,005 --> 00:15:29,566
which means that they all look like they're

313
00:15:29,566 --> 00:15:30,766
made of physical materials.

314
00:15:30,766 --> 00:15:31,927
They're not wire frames.

315
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:34,328
They're not just floating sort of buttons.

316
00:15:34,328 --> 00:15:38,509
They look like they're made of wood or metal or stone.

317
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:41,030
In Baldur's Gate, Baldur's Gate 2, and Icewind Dale,

318
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:44,611
it was a U-style interface where three sides of the screen

319
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:47,692
were covered with buttons with the portraits on one side,

320
00:15:47,692 --> 00:15:50,273
one set of icons on another, and a third set

321
00:15:50,273 --> 00:15:51,293
of icons along the bottom.

322
00:15:54,003 --> 00:15:56,445
Planescape, Torment, and Icewind Dale 2

323
00:15:56,445 --> 00:15:58,346
used a solid bar across the bottom.

324
00:15:58,346 --> 00:16:02,049
I guess we could have tried to support both of these UI

325
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:03,791
layouts, but it was difficult enough

326
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,492
trying to build just one UI.

327
00:16:06,729 --> 00:16:09,550
So we went with a compact style across the bottom.

328
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,032
That was the style that we used in Icewind Dale 2 and Planescape

329
00:16:12,032 --> 00:16:12,773
Torment.

330
00:16:12,773 --> 00:16:15,534
It allowed for pretty efficient mouse movement.

331
00:16:15,534 --> 00:16:18,096
That's something that the U style makes very difficult.

332
00:16:18,096 --> 00:16:20,278
A lot of players use hotkeys and they don't care about that.

333
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:22,619
But for people that mostly play with the mouse,

334
00:16:22,619 --> 00:16:25,001
having a very small loop of movement

335
00:16:25,001 --> 00:16:28,123
so you can access all of your icons in a very tiny area

336
00:16:28,123 --> 00:16:28,763
was important.

337
00:16:30,017 --> 00:16:34,783
Some people really did not like the fact that our HUD had a lot of open space in it

338
00:16:34,783 --> 00:16:39,889
So we offered a solid HUD option where you just basically click an option and would ground the whole thing

339
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:46,337
So it made all the UI elements sort of go in front of a solid background and separated that from the playable space

340
00:16:46,337 --> 00:16:48,199
Which is very much like the infinity engine games

341
00:16:51,151 --> 00:16:55,453
This is another place where accuracy, people's memory is kind of interesting.

342
00:16:55,453 --> 00:17:03,696
So there are a few people, more than a few people that told us that we had stolen our cursor assets directly from the Infinity Engine games.

343
00:17:03,696 --> 00:17:07,197
Like they insisted that we had actually taken the art assets.

344
00:17:07,197 --> 00:17:09,478
Which is weird because if you look at them side by side...

345
00:17:10,058 --> 00:17:11,460
They're not really that similar.

346
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,881
I mean, they're sort of similar.

347
00:17:12,881 --> 00:17:14,482
But people's memories insisted.

348
00:17:14,482 --> 00:17:17,124
They were like, no, no, no, you directly use the art asset.

349
00:17:17,124 --> 00:17:19,226
We intentionally made them very close

350
00:17:19,226 --> 00:17:21,628
because there's nothing wrong with that icon style.

351
00:17:21,628 --> 00:17:24,310
They all communicated what they needed to very well.

352
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,230
It captured the feeling.

353
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:28,213
And clearly, people felt that it was fitting with the style

354
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,334
that had preceded it.

355
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:33,166
The item sketches on the top are from Baldur's Gate 2.

356
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:38,469
They're some of the most powerful weapons that you can find in the game. Some of you probably recognize them.

357
00:17:38,469 --> 00:17:40,910
Unfortunately when we had the first

358
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,552
the game come out, we did not have any item sketches.

359
00:17:43,552 --> 00:17:47,294
We didn't have time to do all the item sketches and people really missed them.

360
00:17:47,294 --> 00:17:50,435
It wasn't make or break for people, but we could tell that people were disappointed in it.

361
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:55,319
So when we made the expansion, the White March, we had a new type of item called soulbound items

362
00:17:55,319 --> 00:18:00,203
and they were very powerful and you leveled them up over time and all those soulbound items had their own sketches

363
00:18:00,203 --> 00:18:03,726
and we made them very detailed and cool and people really appreciated it.

364
00:18:03,726 --> 00:18:08,530
So that was a case where we had omitted something from the beginning for scheduling purposes

365
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:12,773
and then later on we found a way to re-include it and people did really appreciate it.

366
00:18:14,648 --> 00:18:16,549
One thing we did do a lot of in the game

367
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:17,609
is scripted interactions.

368
00:18:17,609 --> 00:18:19,149
This is something that we added that was not

369
00:18:19,149 --> 00:18:20,470
in the Infinity Engine games.

370
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,810
It was in Darklands, and I love Darklands.

371
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,651
And more than just loving Darklands,

372
00:18:25,651 --> 00:18:30,092
it allows designers to create these really cool sequences

373
00:18:30,092 --> 00:18:32,313
that would be extremely difficult to do

374
00:18:32,313 --> 00:18:35,173
with a small budget on a game that's essentially

375
00:18:35,173 --> 00:18:36,714
an isometric 2D game.

376
00:18:36,714 --> 00:18:39,314
So in this case, you're on a mine cart ride.

377
00:18:39,314 --> 00:18:41,615
I don't really want to do a party-based mine cart

378
00:18:41,615 --> 00:18:44,095
ride in Unity in our RPG engine.

379
00:18:45,236 --> 00:18:48,859
So, you can do it in a scripted interaction, which is a choose your own adventure sequence.

380
00:18:48,859 --> 00:18:52,582
All the little sections are illustrated, the player chooses different options, and then

381
00:18:52,582 --> 00:18:56,106
based on the characters they have or the stats they have, things go one way or another.

382
00:18:56,106 --> 00:19:00,109
They have little sound effects, and people responded really well and very positively

383
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:02,411
to them, and they're not that expensive to make.

384
00:19:02,411 --> 00:19:05,494
Also, the concept artists really love making them too, which is always a benefit.

385
00:19:07,508 --> 00:19:13,270
Remember what I said about people not liking the UI in some cases? Yeah, some people really,

386
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:19,132
really liked having that U style interface. They don't care about how far away the icons are.

387
00:19:19,132 --> 00:19:23,393
They don't care because they use hot keys or they just like the aesthetics and all they want

388
00:19:23,393 --> 00:19:28,435
is just that classic style. So some modders made the IE mod which changed a number of rules

389
00:19:28,435 --> 00:19:33,077
but it also changed how the UI worked. It really changed it quite a bit and as you can see

390
00:19:33,077 --> 00:19:35,097
here you can drag the elements all over the screen.

391
00:19:35,518 --> 00:19:37,441
And so people can have all sorts of crazy layouts.

392
00:19:37,441 --> 00:19:41,127
People re-skinned the UI, which is all very cool.

393
00:19:41,127 --> 00:19:43,270
Obviously, mods are not necessarily a solution

394
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,913
to your development choices, but it

395
00:19:44,913 --> 00:19:48,318
is very cool when you have a fan community that

396
00:19:48,318 --> 00:19:50,321
is interested enough to actually modify those things.

397
00:19:50,782 --> 00:19:55,748
And I think the important thing here is that if people want to modify your game, this is

398
00:19:55,748 --> 00:19:59,333
pretty common knowledge, but let them modify your game unless you're doing something multiplayer

399
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,276
where it's very important that they don't mess with it.

400
00:20:01,276 --> 00:20:05,701
In a single player game, this stuff goes a long way and it adds a lot of longevity to

401
00:20:05,701 --> 00:20:06,082
your game.

402
00:20:08,697 --> 00:20:12,218
This is a comparison of our interfaces for inventory.

403
00:20:12,218 --> 00:20:14,778
Baldur's Gate on the left and Pillars of Eternity on the right.

404
00:20:14,778 --> 00:20:17,139
We kept the style largely the same.

405
00:20:17,139 --> 00:20:21,120
We used the fact that we had a higher resolution to incorporate all the character inventories

406
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,540
onto one screen.

407
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,421
This made it a lot easier to manage a lot of that stuff.

408
00:20:25,421 --> 00:20:29,321
We did find some classic gamers that didn't like that this was managed this way.

409
00:20:29,321 --> 00:20:32,822
We also included a stash that allowed you to carry everything you found.

410
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:36,523
Again, some classic gamers did not really like that you could carry everything you found,

411
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:40,284
and so we included an option to disable that.

412
00:20:40,284 --> 00:20:42,745
Some people just really want the super hardcore experience.

413
00:20:42,745 --> 00:20:46,586
But most of the players that we found generally play with the stash on.

414
00:20:46,586 --> 00:20:50,507
They like that it eliminated a lot of the tedium of moving things between a lot of party

415
00:20:50,507 --> 00:20:54,148
members or hitting arbitrary limits, and that helped a great deal.

416
00:20:54,148 --> 00:20:58,069
But overall, we kept the look and the feel and the style of it very similar to the original

417
00:20:58,069 --> 00:20:59,029
Infinity Engine games.

418
00:21:00,243 --> 00:21:02,966
So looking back, some backers really hated the GUI.

419
00:21:02,966 --> 00:21:04,027
Oh, my holy cow.

420
00:21:04,027 --> 00:21:07,009
If you could see some of the threads on the Obsidian forum,

421
00:21:07,009 --> 00:21:10,373
some of the longest threads are about GUI mockups.

422
00:21:10,373 --> 00:21:11,694
And people would mock up their own GUIs.

423
00:21:11,694 --> 00:21:13,676
Some of them are really cool aesthetically.

424
00:21:13,676 --> 00:21:17,199
A lot of them would never work in a million years.

425
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:19,301
Any UX designers would look at it and say, like.

426
00:21:19,882 --> 00:21:21,583
You didn't include this, you didn't include that.

427
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,004
But they had a lot of fun talking about it,

428
00:21:23,004 --> 00:21:25,667
and then they had a lot of fun modding it.

429
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:27,828
So no professional reviews that I saw ever

430
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,269
had negative feedback about it.

431
00:21:29,269 --> 00:21:32,172
They'd say, like, yep, classic style interface.

432
00:21:32,172 --> 00:21:33,953
Feels just like the old games.

433
00:21:33,953 --> 00:21:35,274
So that part of it worked well.

434
00:21:35,274 --> 00:21:38,977
People did miss our sketches, so we did bring them back.

435
00:21:38,977 --> 00:21:40,739
And they loved scripted interactions.

436
00:21:40,739 --> 00:21:42,720
So when we made the expansions, we

437
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,482
allocated a lot more time to doing

438
00:21:44,482 --> 00:21:46,784
scripted interaction images, and people really enjoyed them.

439
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,846
The lesson we learned from all this is that, I mean, we kind of already knew this, but

440
00:21:50,846 --> 00:21:53,708
UI can be extremely divisive.

441
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:56,589
You can't make everyone happy with your layout choices.

442
00:21:56,589 --> 00:21:58,610
You can't make everyone happy with how the UI works.

443
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:01,192
So try to find something that you feel works well.

444
00:22:01,192 --> 00:22:05,114
Obviously you don't want to do something that infuriates your audience, but if you find

445
00:22:05,114 --> 00:22:08,076
something that works well, stick with it.

446
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:12,158
Obviously listen to feedback, but if you try to make everyone happy, you're actually going

447
00:22:12,158 --> 00:22:13,559
to make everyone unhappy in the end.

448
00:22:14,361 --> 00:22:18,564
In the future, we want to continue improving our GUI for usability.

449
00:22:18,564 --> 00:22:23,167
We did make a lot of edits to it in our patches, organizing things better, offering better

450
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:26,249
tool tips, that's something you can always improve and look at.

451
00:22:26,249 --> 00:22:32,052
We don't ever want to engineer out GUI modding because that's fun stuff for the fan community

452
00:22:32,052 --> 00:22:32,313
to do.

453
00:22:32,313 --> 00:22:36,095
Again, if someone wants to have their UI look a certain way, it's a single player game,

454
00:22:36,095 --> 00:22:38,797
it's not affecting anything, great, let them go nuts.

455
00:22:38,797 --> 00:22:42,899
And always more scripted interactions because we like making them and players seem to like

456
00:22:42,899 --> 00:22:43,300
playing them.

457
00:22:45,112 --> 00:22:48,652
When it comes to game mechanics, there are a few things that we knew right away we were

458
00:22:48,652 --> 00:22:52,293
going to make something that was AD&D like, meaning sort of like second edition AD&D,

459
00:22:52,293 --> 00:22:54,194
third edition D&D.

460
00:22:54,194 --> 00:22:58,735
We wanted to have fewer arbitrary limitations and fewer exceptions in the rule set.

461
00:22:58,735 --> 00:23:03,116
The reason I'm mentioning that is because I worked on the original Infinity Engine games,

462
00:23:03,116 --> 00:23:07,717
or at least two of them, and I had a huge amount of experience playing Dungeons & Dragons

463
00:23:07,717 --> 00:23:11,858
prior to coming to Black Isle, and I was sure that it was super easy to understand and easy

464
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:12,218
to get into.

465
00:23:13,488 --> 00:23:19,331
If you watch people play these games who don't have experience with D&D, you find that is not true at all.

466
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:26,354
There's a lot of arcane lore built up in playing Dungeons & Dragons that is not intuitive to people.

467
00:23:26,354 --> 00:23:31,557
It doesn't necessarily always need to be intuitive to people, but knowing that it was a huge stumbling block for a lot of players,

468
00:23:31,557 --> 00:23:38,060
it was important to us to make a system that had fewer arbitrary sort of limitations and rule limitations.

469
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:45,849
You know, we didn't limit what races could be what classes, we didn't limit who could use certain types of gear or things like that.

470
00:23:45,849 --> 00:23:51,575
And overall, we didn't rely on sort of hidden hard counters that would take players a long time to learn.

471
00:23:51,575 --> 00:23:53,898
We also wanted to have a faster combat pace.

472
00:23:53,898 --> 00:24:00,325
This was done to address a problem in the early parts of the Infinity Engine games where combat could be very slow.

473
00:24:00,525 --> 00:24:05,272
It went on a six-second, each round was on a six-second timer, and each character would

474
00:24:05,272 --> 00:24:08,738
typically only perform one action, and so at the beginning of the game, combat could

475
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:13,345
move very, very slowly and be very, very boring, so we wanted to speed that pace up.

476
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:18,006
We did not have party AI at launch, that's something a lot of people really missed.

477
00:24:18,006 --> 00:24:20,528
It was unfortunate, we just didn't have time to do it.

478
00:24:20,528 --> 00:24:22,829
And unfortunately we had limited modability.

479
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:28,353
The Infinity Engine games could be modded very heavily, ours could not, and that turned out to be not good.

480
00:24:28,353 --> 00:24:31,895
And finally, the stronghold had a very limited time for content implementation,

481
00:24:31,895 --> 00:24:35,457
so we went for a system-heavy implementation, and nobody liked it.

482
00:24:35,457 --> 00:24:37,638
Well, I shouldn't say nobody, but almost nobody liked it.

483
00:24:39,355 --> 00:24:41,456
The combat pacing changes we made were a mixed bag.

484
00:24:41,456 --> 00:24:43,956
It did address the problems at the beginning of the game

485
00:24:43,956 --> 00:24:45,617
where combat was very slowly paced.

486
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:48,297
But once you got a party of about five or six characters,

487
00:24:48,297 --> 00:24:50,638
combat was very hard to follow.

488
00:24:50,638 --> 00:24:52,538
It was exacerbated by the fact that we

489
00:24:52,538 --> 00:24:56,259
had visual effects that were very overpowering and a lot

490
00:24:56,259 --> 00:24:57,560
of monsters on the screen.

491
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,140
And so people almost all wound up

492
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,200
defaulting to the slow combat pace

493
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,141
after a few hours of gameplay.

494
00:25:03,412 --> 00:25:05,773
That's not really the way we wanted it to go.

495
00:25:05,773 --> 00:25:08,895
We wanted the normal combat pace to be the one

496
00:25:08,895 --> 00:25:09,916
that you typically play at.

497
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:13,398
So we overcorrected in that regard.

498
00:25:13,398 --> 00:25:14,359
These are examples of 2DAs.

499
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:17,921
These are two dimensional arrays.

500
00:25:17,921 --> 00:25:23,305
This is what BioWare used to drive most of the data

501
00:25:23,305 --> 00:25:24,946
in the Infinity Engine games, also

502
00:25:24,946 --> 00:25:26,507
what they used in Neverwinter Nights

503
00:25:26,507 --> 00:25:28,788
and what we used in Neverwinter Nights 2.

504
00:25:28,788 --> 00:25:30,109
They're just, they're just.

505
00:25:30,289 --> 00:25:34,992
two dimensional array, it's a tab delimited Excel file.

506
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:37,134
So you can open it in Notepad.

507
00:25:37,134 --> 00:25:40,636
Some people just edit it, I edited things in Notepad when I was working on these games.

508
00:25:40,636 --> 00:25:44,618
And then there are third party tools where you can open them up and edit them a lot more

509
00:25:44,618 --> 00:25:45,059
easily.

510
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:47,961
The point is that it was really, really easy to change things.

511
00:25:47,961 --> 00:25:52,764
If you didn't like, you know, the bonus that a 19 strength gave to a character, you could

512
00:25:52,764 --> 00:25:53,624
just go in and change it.

513
00:25:53,624 --> 00:25:54,865
It was very fast and very easy.

514
00:25:54,865 --> 00:25:59,148
You modify the file, you put it in an override directory, you run the game and it works.

515
00:25:59,528 --> 00:26:08,034
Our file formats were, we used Unity and they were all bound up in what Unity's file formats are and people had trouble getting to them.

516
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:15,000
So it made modding, not impossible, but very difficult and as a result, the fan community didn't really do a ton of modding on the game systems.

517
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,043
And even though I'm a game system designer, I love it when people modify that stuff.

518
00:26:19,043 --> 00:26:25,628
Like, that's totally great and fine and I want people to do it, but we didn't have time to support it and I think it really hurt us in the long run.

519
00:26:27,213 --> 00:26:31,036
About halfway through development, we realized that the stronghold that we had promised was

520
00:26:31,036 --> 00:26:33,277
not going to have time for a lot of content.

521
00:26:33,277 --> 00:26:37,781
We had only so many area designers and only so many writers, and they were all busy making

522
00:26:37,781 --> 00:26:42,364
all the crit path areas and all their dialogues for companions and things like that.

523
00:26:42,364 --> 00:26:47,568
So there was time on the system design side, so I made a little system for it.

524
00:26:47,568 --> 00:26:50,150
And it had, you had prestige, and you had security.

525
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:54,251
and you got taxes and nobody cares, it's all stupid.

526
00:26:54,251 --> 00:26:55,572
It wasn't very fun.

527
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:59,453
You can see all these little upgrades you can do, but they were the same for everybody.

528
00:26:59,453 --> 00:27:02,474
So as soon as you were done with your stronghold, it looked like that.

529
00:27:02,474 --> 00:27:04,495
It didn't matter what character you were playing,

530
00:27:04,495 --> 00:27:07,076
it didn't really matter what choices you made along the way,

531
00:27:07,076 --> 00:27:09,637
because ultimately, once your stronghold was repaired,

532
00:27:09,637 --> 00:27:11,457
it would always look like that stronghold.

533
00:27:12,462 --> 00:27:15,824
If you compare this to Baldur's Gate 2, Baldur's Gate 2 had a

534
00:27:15,824 --> 00:27:19,227
bunch of smaller levels, but there were a bunch of them and

535
00:27:19,227 --> 00:27:23,109
they had no system behind it. You're just like, hey, you took

536
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:25,371
over DRNE's keep, you're a fighter, this is your stronghold

537
00:27:25,371 --> 00:27:30,314
now. Congratulations. Here's a quest. Great. That's what people

538
00:27:30,314 --> 00:27:33,156
actually wanted in a stronghold was variety and options to pick

539
00:27:33,156 --> 00:27:36,318
from and then cool content to play through. We didn't do that.

540
00:27:37,726 --> 00:27:42,948
So when we finally got around to making our third, well it's not our third patch, but patch 3.0,

541
00:27:42,948 --> 00:27:46,210
we incorporated a lot of new Stronghold content.

542
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:50,612
We had dilemmas where you as the Lord of the Keep would, people would come to you with problems

543
00:27:50,612 --> 00:27:54,734
and you could sort of decide as the arbiter of the land, like, who got to do what,

544
00:27:54,734 --> 00:27:57,215
or if a guy got hung outside your castle walls.

545
00:27:57,215 --> 00:27:59,556
And we introduced a new quest line.

546
00:28:00,117 --> 00:28:05,560
about someone who contends or contests your right to even own the stronghold that you have,

547
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,021
culminating in the Battle of Yen Wood Field.

548
00:28:07,021 --> 00:28:10,684
And it didn't require a huge amount of development time,

549
00:28:10,684 --> 00:28:12,245
but it was a really cool sequence.

550
00:28:12,245 --> 00:28:16,708
We have a big scripted interaction where all these different forces that you marshal over time

551
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:18,089
sort of clash against each other,

552
00:28:18,089 --> 00:28:21,151
and then after you sort of go through the opening stages of the battle,

553
00:28:21,151 --> 00:28:22,572
you have this huge battlefield,

554
00:28:22,572 --> 00:28:25,854
and depending on the circumstances, it plays out in all these different ways.

555
00:28:26,154 --> 00:28:27,277
And people really liked it.

556
00:28:27,277 --> 00:28:29,041
And that's what they wanted.

557
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:32,389
They wanted a stronghold with a cool quest associated with it.

558
00:28:32,389 --> 00:28:34,655
So we learned from that.

559
00:28:36,617 --> 00:28:41,658
So looking back on what we did, the game ultimately was easier to pick up than AD&D 2nd edition,

560
00:28:41,658 --> 00:28:47,181
but it lost a lot of the tactical complexity that the hardcore gamers really enjoy, and

561
00:28:47,181 --> 00:28:51,462
the combat became way too fast once you got to about 5 or more party members, and the

562
00:28:51,462 --> 00:28:53,263
stronghold of course was disappointing.

563
00:28:53,263 --> 00:28:56,744
So the lessons we learned about that are it's fine to have some rough edges and exceptions

564
00:28:56,744 --> 00:28:59,665
and things, that's okay as long as the whole system isn't built around them.

565
00:29:00,426 --> 00:29:02,608
Don't overcorrect, which is easier said than done.

566
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:06,791
When you look at a problem, it's easy to pull back way too far.

567
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:09,894
You have to be careful and make sure that you haven't done that, because otherwise you

568
00:29:09,894 --> 00:29:12,136
will piss some people off.

569
00:29:12,136 --> 00:29:13,617
Always allow for modding if possible.

570
00:29:13,617 --> 00:29:17,801
I'll say this as much as I can, because every time I've worked on a game that has mods,

571
00:29:17,801 --> 00:29:18,922
it's always good.

572
00:29:18,922 --> 00:29:20,803
I've never seen it go badly.

573
00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:23,345
Pay attention to why people like things.

574
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:26,928
That seems obvious, but people like strongholds, right?

575
00:29:26,928 --> 00:29:28,890
Well, sure, but why do they like strongholds?

576
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:32,673
It's not just enough to have something there that's called a stronghold with a system attached

577
00:29:32,673 --> 00:29:34,375
to it if it's not what people really liked about it.

578
00:29:35,727 --> 00:29:39,989
So in the future, we're looking at, we already have done, adding back in layers of combat

579
00:29:39,989 --> 00:29:42,231
complexity, especially over the course of the game.

580
00:29:42,231 --> 00:29:45,413
Like once you've been playing the game for three, four, five hours, you can add in a

581
00:29:45,413 --> 00:29:46,454
new layer of complexity.

582
00:29:46,454 --> 00:29:50,356
After you've been playing the game for 20 hours, you can add in more layers of complexity.

583
00:29:50,356 --> 00:29:51,837
That's why it's nice making RPGs.

584
00:29:51,837 --> 00:29:54,919
You have a lot of hours over which to introduce new concepts.

585
00:29:56,512 --> 00:30:03,318
Try to have more accessible file formats to support modding whenever possible and focusing on stronghold content and integration into the storyline

586
00:30:03,318 --> 00:30:07,441
So they don't just feel like this separate thing that doesn't have anything to do with the rest of the game

587
00:30:09,727 --> 00:30:11,949
Music and voice acting are all very important.

588
00:30:11,949 --> 00:30:16,613
The Infinity Engine games had great music.

589
00:30:16,613 --> 00:30:18,255
When our composer, Justin Bell, looked

590
00:30:18,255 --> 00:30:20,557
at how to compose for Pillars of Eternity,

591
00:30:20,557 --> 00:30:23,460
he looked at the composers that worked on the Icewind Dale

592
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,121
and Baldur's Gate games.

593
00:30:25,121 --> 00:30:28,905
Inan Zur, who worked on Icewind Dale 2.

594
00:30:28,905 --> 00:30:30,947
Jeremy Soule, who worked on Icewind Dale 1.

595
00:30:30,947 --> 00:30:33,389
And Mikhail Honig, who worked on Baldur's Gate,

596
00:30:33,389 --> 00:30:34,750
which is a great soundtrack.

597
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:39,712
But he also looked at some more contemporary fantasy composers like Howard Shore, who composed

598
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,532
for the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

599
00:30:41,532 --> 00:30:46,233
And he really focused on capturing the mood and the feeling, and it went very well.

600
00:30:46,233 --> 00:30:49,534
I think on the development side we were all very happy with it, and we got pretty good

601
00:30:49,534 --> 00:30:54,776
feedback from our fans whenever we released music and on the game in general.

602
00:30:56,001 --> 00:31:00,463
One problem though is that we had a very limited voice acting budget,

603
00:31:00,463 --> 00:31:06,746
and so we allocated our resources, kind of spreading them out across a lot of characters in a kind of strange way.

604
00:31:06,746 --> 00:31:10,948
So when people played the game, it seemed very random when lines would come in,

605
00:31:10,948 --> 00:31:14,469
or when, like, you'd have a conversation start, and then people would say two lines,

606
00:31:14,469 --> 00:31:16,690
and then they wouldn't talk anymore.

607
00:31:17,335 --> 00:31:19,937
And so it seemed like a bug, but then in another conversation,

608
00:31:19,937 --> 00:31:22,159
they might talk through the whole thing.

609
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,560
And that was kind of us just looking at these resources

610
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,481
and dicing them up way too far apart.

611
00:31:26,481 --> 00:31:29,203
So the lesson we learned there is

612
00:31:29,203 --> 00:31:31,205
that when you have limited resources, don't.

613
00:31:31,438 --> 00:31:32,819
Don't spread them too thin.

614
00:31:32,819 --> 00:31:34,920
Because in our case, once we played the game,

615
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,520
it was obvious.

616
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,801
But by the time we played the game, it was too late.

617
00:31:37,801 --> 00:31:39,322
We played it, and we said, oh, jeez, this

618
00:31:39,322 --> 00:31:40,642
sounds really awkward and buggy.

619
00:31:40,642 --> 00:31:45,084
In the future, we are pretty happy with the style of music

620
00:31:45,084 --> 00:31:46,024
that we wound up with.

621
00:31:46,024 --> 00:31:48,445
But we want to experiment more with things like leitmotif,

622
00:31:48,445 --> 00:31:50,286
incorporating themes of various characters

623
00:31:50,286 --> 00:31:51,847
into key story moments and things

624
00:31:51,847 --> 00:31:54,288
like that to reinforce the narrative flow of the game.

625
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:57,289
And just being smarter about allocating our voice acting

626
00:31:57,289 --> 00:31:58,370
resources.

627
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:01,751
because it did really seem strange to a lot of people.

628
00:32:01,751 --> 00:32:02,611
When we set out to design this world,

629
00:32:02,611 --> 00:32:06,133
we knew that we were going to build a traditional fantasy

630
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:06,653
setting.

631
00:32:06,653 --> 00:32:09,054
We knew from the beginning we weren't

632
00:32:09,054 --> 00:32:11,815
trying to make something really wild and crazy.

633
00:32:11,815 --> 00:32:15,397
By the way, I know that the Torment Tides of Numenera guys

634
00:32:15,397 --> 00:32:17,438
are here, and they have a crazy world.

635
00:32:17,438 --> 00:32:19,759
So if you get a chance to see those guys, bug them.

636
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:22,280
Especially bug Colin McComb, because I like it

637
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,300
when people bug Colin.

638
00:32:24,675 --> 00:32:28,297
But our world is going to be pretty traditional, pretty standard fantasy setting.

639
00:32:28,297 --> 00:32:30,478
We wanted to change a few elements.

640
00:32:30,478 --> 00:32:34,560
So we didn't have halflings or gnomes or orcs.

641
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,821
We do have elves and dwarves.

642
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:39,903
We knew a lot of people wanted to play their elves and their dwarves, but not people like,

643
00:32:39,903 --> 00:32:42,064
no, my gnome, I can't play my gnome.

644
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:47,820
So we do know that people like to play little characters and big characters, so we introduced

645
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:52,343
Orlins as our new small race and Omawa as our new big race, and they're not really like

646
00:32:52,343 --> 00:32:55,646
halflings or orcs, but they're little and big guys, so people can play them.

647
00:32:55,646 --> 00:32:59,849
And then we incorporated Godlike, and Godlike are just a ripoff of Ganassi.

648
00:32:59,849 --> 00:33:04,812
So if you played Massive the Betrayer for Neverwinter 2, as soon as we included Ganassi,

649
00:33:04,812 --> 00:33:07,774
everyone was playing Ganassi, and sure enough, when people had background PCs,

650
00:33:08,255 --> 00:33:11,141
half of them were godlike. So people really liked the

651
00:33:11,141 --> 00:33:13,527
aesthetic of those characters so we incorporated them.

652
00:33:14,245 --> 00:33:24,734
We did decide we were going to have a Eurocentric type of setting, so a lot of the elements you see from constructed languages to architecture borrows from medieval central Europe, usually.

653
00:33:24,734 --> 00:33:26,195
Very standard and traditional.

654
00:33:26,195 --> 00:33:29,558
We did try to move the timeline of our setting forward a little bit.

655
00:33:29,558 --> 00:33:38,144
A lot of fantasy settings are in this vaguely 12th to 15th century English, French, German kind of place.

656
00:33:38,144 --> 00:33:39,806
We wanted to set it squarely.

657
00:33:40,046 --> 00:33:46,089
in the 16th century with a renaissance zeitgeist that seemed to capture the feeling of a world in change.

658
00:33:46,089 --> 00:33:49,831
That's something else that I think a lot of fantasy settings feel like.

659
00:33:49,831 --> 00:33:53,893
For 2000 years we've had plate armor and people have been casting fireballs and that's it.

660
00:33:53,893 --> 00:33:57,295
So we wanted to make it feel like this world was actually changing over time.

661
00:33:57,295 --> 00:34:02,658
We did decide to go with a blank slate character versus pre-defining the character.

662
00:34:02,658 --> 00:34:06,600
That's sort of a mixed thing because later on in the game you do find out that your character does have...

663
00:34:07,384 --> 00:34:11,688
Spoilers, some things in a past life, because our setting is about reincarnation.

664
00:34:11,688 --> 00:34:16,232
But in Baldur's Gate, you are a ball spawn, and that you are pursued right away as soon

665
00:34:16,232 --> 00:34:18,334
as the game starts, so that's a part of who your character is.

666
00:34:18,334 --> 00:34:21,397
And in Planescape Torment, you are the nameless one.

667
00:34:21,397 --> 00:34:24,680
You can define a lot of things about the nameless one, but you're always that dude.

668
00:34:25,323 --> 00:34:30,248
The companions, themes, quests, and the tone of our dialogue were pretty serious.

669
00:34:30,248 --> 00:34:34,372
Obviously this is all relative, but if you compare them to the other Infinity Engine games,

670
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:37,956
it was like serious mode to the point of being too serious.

671
00:34:39,645 --> 00:34:41,867
So if you look at our companions versus, for example,

672
00:34:41,867 --> 00:34:44,789
the Baldur's Gate 2 companions, Baldur's Gate 2 companions

673
00:34:44,789 --> 00:34:46,250
were pretty diverse in terms of you

674
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,953
had pretty serious characters, you had totally wacky dudes,

675
00:34:49,953 --> 00:34:52,575
you had characters with long involved quest lines,

676
00:34:52,575 --> 00:34:54,376
you had characters that had no quest at all,

677
00:34:54,376 --> 00:34:56,038
you had characters with romances,

678
00:34:56,038 --> 00:34:57,479
some characters that didn't have romances.

679
00:34:57,479 --> 00:34:59,640
And those are pretty broad spectrum.

680
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,442
For pillars, we had initially eight companions

681
00:35:02,442 --> 00:35:04,023
that we expanded to 11.

682
00:35:04,924 --> 00:35:06,225
They were super serious.

683
00:35:06,225 --> 00:35:08,047
That's not entirely true.

684
00:35:08,047 --> 00:35:09,848
Horovius was kind of a goofy character,

685
00:35:09,848 --> 00:35:11,449
but you find him very late in the game

686
00:35:11,449 --> 00:35:12,971
compared to the other characters.

687
00:35:12,971 --> 00:35:16,533
And Adair is a funny guy, but all of his humor is very dry.

688
00:35:16,533 --> 00:35:19,055
So if you compare any of the Pillars of Eternity companions

689
00:35:19,055 --> 00:35:22,818
to someone like Minsc, Minsc is a wacky, wacky dude.

690
00:35:22,818 --> 00:35:24,580
By the way, I've seen Minsc show up in,

691
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:27,482
he was in like a new D&D comic that came out like a month ago.

692
00:35:27,482 --> 00:35:29,684
That character is still around and doing things.

693
00:35:29,684 --> 00:35:31,505
So clearly there's a place, and people really

694
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:33,867
like these zany, zany characters.

695
00:35:35,535 --> 00:35:37,937
So looking back on what we did, players and reviewers

696
00:35:37,937 --> 00:35:39,338
had mixed and favorable reactions

697
00:35:39,338 --> 00:35:40,880
about the world and lore.

698
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,681
A lot of people wished that we had

699
00:35:42,681 --> 00:35:46,865
done more experimental or adventurous or crazy things.

700
00:35:46,865 --> 00:35:48,326
That's not really what we set out to do.

701
00:35:48,326 --> 00:35:51,829
It is something we'd like to look at doing in the future.

702
00:35:51,829 --> 00:35:53,630
There was a lot to learn and keep track of.

703
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:59,081
The beginning of the game especially was extremely dense with a lot of crazy constructed language

704
00:35:59,081 --> 00:36:03,923
terms and new ideas and wacky stuff and it was just a lot to absorb very early in the

705
00:36:03,923 --> 00:36:04,744
game.

706
00:36:04,744 --> 00:36:08,005
And a lot of players missed the light-hearted and funny elements that were in, especially

707
00:36:08,005 --> 00:36:09,205
the Baldur's Gate games.

708
00:36:09,205 --> 00:36:13,507
The tone of your source material, the lesson to take away from this is that the tone of

709
00:36:13,507 --> 00:36:15,288
your source material is very important.

710
00:36:15,288 --> 00:36:20,370
If you strike the wrong tone with something, again, it's not going to really capture the

711
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:21,610
same feeling as what came before it.

712
00:36:22,191 --> 00:36:29,208
So in the future we do want to introduce more diverse and interesting locations that are all not like the middle of central Europe

713
00:36:29,208 --> 00:36:29,689
No offense

714
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,320
I like Central Europe.

715
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,741
But more diverse locations.

716
00:36:33,741 --> 00:36:37,322
We have to be more attentive about how we pace lore.

717
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:39,062
Another game that we're working on at Obsidian

718
00:36:39,062 --> 00:36:41,383
called Tyranny has a very cool system

719
00:36:41,383 --> 00:36:42,783
for highlighting sort of keywords

720
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:46,084
and getting little pop-up blurbs about things for lore.

721
00:36:46,084 --> 00:36:46,784
It's very useful.

722
00:36:46,784 --> 00:36:47,924
We want to use something like that.

723
00:36:47,924 --> 00:36:51,865
So when you see a term like brishalgwin or beowik,

724
00:36:51,865 --> 00:36:53,105
and you're like, what the hell is that?

725
00:36:53,105 --> 00:36:54,206
I've seen that word five times.

726
00:36:54,206 --> 00:36:55,846
You can just hover it, and it'll tell you,

727
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,106
and then you can keep reading.

728
00:36:57,567 --> 00:37:00,668
And then we also do want to include some sillier characters.

729
00:37:00,668 --> 00:37:04,430
One thing we've even talked about is having essentially two types of companions.

730
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:09,452
One that's sort of a story companion that has their own quest and they're incorporated very directly in the crit path.

731
00:37:09,452 --> 00:37:13,974
And other characters that are specifically designated, especially from the player's perspective,

732
00:37:13,974 --> 00:37:18,757
as being there more for like, you know, just kind of their voice set, their appearance.

733
00:37:18,757 --> 00:37:22,798
They're not as deep, but that would allow us to get a lot more variety in our characters.

734
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,421
Beta is in early access.

735
00:37:26,421 --> 00:37:30,285
Early access, a very popular topic these days.

736
00:37:30,285 --> 00:37:32,006
Lots of games coming out in early access.

737
00:37:32,006 --> 00:37:33,948
So it was two years ago.

738
00:37:33,948 --> 00:37:37,731
Actually, it was two years ago, literally today, that we,

739
00:37:37,731 --> 00:37:39,813
I think, I think, that we went into open beta.

740
00:37:40,774 --> 00:37:44,695
And, um, I'm sorry, it wasn't an open beta, it was a closed beta.

741
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:46,275
But it was immediately following Gamescom.

742
00:37:46,275 --> 00:37:51,536
And because we were showing the game publicly, and because people could come play it,

743
00:37:51,536 --> 00:37:56,317
we knew we had to launch the beta then, or else people would be very justifiably pissed off.

744
00:37:56,317 --> 00:37:58,738
That beta was buggy as hell.

745
00:37:58,738 --> 00:38:03,399
And we tried to offer a lot of caveats, but there's something you should learn,

746
00:38:03,399 --> 00:38:05,419
is that no matter how much you say,

747
00:38:05,419 --> 00:38:07,500
Hey everyone, keep in mind, this is a beta.

748
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,443
we're not done. There's still a lot of features to work on. We're still working on things.

749
00:38:11,443 --> 00:38:16,728
That does not limit how angry people are going to get. They're going to get so mad. They're

750
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:22,113
going to get furious. Not everyone will, but a ton of people will be very, very upset. We

751
00:38:22,113 --> 00:38:26,957
had people wanting their money back because we had betrayed them and all this stuff.

752
00:38:27,243 --> 00:38:32,367
But the thing is, those betas are good, because no matter how strongly people react, you do

753
00:38:32,367 --> 00:38:34,309
get a lot of good feedback out of them.

754
00:38:34,309 --> 00:38:36,410
You do need time to iterate, though.

755
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:39,513
If you don't really have time to iterate, there's no point to doing a beta.

756
00:38:39,513 --> 00:38:45,298
You need to take their feedback, let it wash over you, bury you in the ground, you resurrect

757
00:38:45,298 --> 00:38:49,682
yourself, you come up, you address some of their concerns, and you say, how about now?

758
00:38:49,682 --> 00:38:51,483
They punch you in the face, you fall down.

759
00:38:52,967 --> 00:38:54,289
But you have to keep doing that.

760
00:38:54,289 --> 00:38:56,632
And you can't, again, you can't make everyone happy,

761
00:38:56,632 --> 00:38:58,194
but you can get a lot of good feedback.

762
00:38:58,194 --> 00:39:00,798
The vocal minority sometimes does have a point.

763
00:39:00,798 --> 00:39:03,021
Like, that's the thing is that don't,

764
00:39:03,021 --> 00:39:05,805
just because they're a vocal minority,

765
00:39:05,805 --> 00:39:08,429
does not mean, just like it doesn't mean that they're right

766
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,651
because they're loud.

767
00:39:09,891 --> 00:39:12,011
and persistent, it doesn't mean they're wrong.

768
00:39:12,011 --> 00:39:14,372
So sometimes they have a point, but also keep in mind

769
00:39:14,372 --> 00:39:17,312
that you do have a broader audience, presumably,

770
00:39:17,312 --> 00:39:18,413
that you want to meet.

771
00:39:18,413 --> 00:39:21,433
It's not just 10 people on your forums arguing

772
00:39:21,433 --> 00:39:23,654
about one aspect of your game.

773
00:39:23,654 --> 00:39:27,494
So try to reach out and find more people to play your game.

774
00:39:27,494 --> 00:39:29,795
Betas and early access are typically

775
00:39:29,795 --> 00:39:33,635
for very hardcore people, like even among hardcore people.

776
00:39:33,635 --> 00:39:35,756
So just be very conscious of.

777
00:39:36,076 --> 00:39:39,166
of the type of people that are actually playing your game and try to reach out and find more

778
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:41,956
people that are in your audience that might be interested in it.

779
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:47,711
So despite the initial criticism that we had, our beta did allow

780
00:39:47,711 --> 00:39:49,551
for a lot of iteration and early, a lot of iteration. And

781
00:39:49,551 --> 00:39:54,253
the early feedback that was very negative, it didn't really seem

782
00:39:54,253 --> 00:39:57,354
to affect the launch. Because the beta period went on for a

783
00:39:57,354 --> 00:40:00,315
very long time. And once we launched, people had forgotten

784
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:04,936
about all the stupid beetles and horrible gooey bugs and stuff

785
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:06,957
like that. Like all that stuff kind of faded away. Now they're

786
00:40:06,957 --> 00:40:08,937
focusing on new terrible bugs.

787
00:40:10,198 --> 00:40:15,099
So the lesson there is that betas and early access are a great way to get feedback from your most passionate players,

788
00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:18,100
but you have to remember that they're very passionate.

789
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:22,881
And so you have to take what they say with a grain of salt, you have to try to get other feedback.

790
00:40:22,881 --> 00:40:25,481
We want to try to offer more betas in the future.

791
00:40:25,481 --> 00:40:27,482
We want to improve the feedback loop,

792
00:40:27,482 --> 00:40:31,423
because the faster we can turn around iterations and get people's feedback on it, the better.

793
00:40:32,123 --> 00:40:34,004
and try to find ways to increase the player base.

794
00:40:34,004 --> 00:40:36,887
What we found is that we still have patch betas, too.

795
00:40:36,887 --> 00:40:38,949
So we've done a lot of post-release support.

796
00:40:38,949 --> 00:40:40,770
And what we found, though, is that over time,

797
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:42,271
there are fewer and fewer people that

798
00:40:42,271 --> 00:40:45,354
are interested in being beta testers for a patch.

799
00:40:45,354 --> 00:40:48,156
So trying to find ways to increase the initial numbers

800
00:40:48,156 --> 00:40:49,757
and then keep people interested in beta

801
00:40:49,757 --> 00:40:51,579
testing in the future can be very helpful.

802
00:40:53,508 --> 00:40:55,629
Post launch support is incredibly helpful.

803
00:40:55,629 --> 00:40:58,312
So again, you have this very, very passionate group

804
00:40:58,312 --> 00:41:00,113
of people, and you have new people coming in.

805
00:41:00,113 --> 00:41:02,875
And when you launch, even if you've had a beta,

806
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:04,697
there's going to be things that people encounter

807
00:41:04,697 --> 00:41:07,679
that make them very mad and very upset.

808
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:08,800
And a lot of times, it's justified.

809
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,881
Sometimes it's not.

810
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:10,261
Whatever.

811
00:41:10,558 --> 00:41:14,660
So you have to pick and choose what you're going to address.

812
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:20,162
We've released 12 patches so far between April 3rd of 2015 and July 11th of this year.

813
00:41:20,162 --> 00:41:23,704
And a lot of our focus is on play balance and UI, making the game easier to understand.

814
00:41:23,704 --> 00:41:28,907
Even though it's not necessarily as complex of a system as AD&D 2nd edition, it still

815
00:41:28,907 --> 00:41:32,128
requires a lot of number crunching and a lot of that stuff is not clear to people.

816
00:41:32,128 --> 00:41:33,849
So we try to make that clearer.

817
00:41:33,849 --> 00:41:37,671
We try to improve some classes that people perceive as being very weak, like the Ranger

818
00:41:37,671 --> 00:41:38,951
and Paladin and later the Rogue.

819
00:41:39,601 --> 00:41:43,103
And we also found that we just jammed too many fights in the game.

820
00:41:43,103 --> 00:41:46,106
Like, exploration and combat are two big pillars of the game,

821
00:41:46,106 --> 00:41:50,349
and we found that combat was very, very heavy, especially in the late parts of the game.

822
00:41:50,349 --> 00:41:53,571
So we actually had a patch where we went through and we thinned out the encounters.

823
00:41:53,571 --> 00:41:57,674
And then the encounters that remained, we tried to bolster them and make them more interesting.

824
00:41:58,705 --> 00:42:03,188
And the last thing is that we focused on restoring some of the lost ingredients, the things that we just missed.

825
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:07,150
The stronghold, we knew when we launched that people were going to be disappointed with the stronghold,

826
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,251
so we tried to add in stronghold content in patch 3.

827
00:42:09,251 --> 00:42:12,813
By the way, that was just patch, that was free.

828
00:42:12,813 --> 00:42:16,955
We realized that we had not hit the mark on that, and we wanted people to just get the improvements,

829
00:42:16,955 --> 00:42:18,636
so they didn't have to get the expansion for that.

830
00:42:18,937 --> 00:42:23,898
We did introduce more hard counters into the combat AI, so you had creatures that were

831
00:42:23,898 --> 00:42:27,178
completely immune to certain damage types, or they were completely immune to a certain

832
00:42:27,178 --> 00:42:31,459
affliction type, and that would force players to change their tactics a little bit more

833
00:42:31,459 --> 00:42:32,900
than the base game did.

834
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,200
And then more distinctive items and item sketches.

835
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,761
Some people were disappointed that our unique items were not interesting enough or compelling

836
00:42:39,761 --> 00:42:45,422
enough, and the patches introduced either better properties on those weapons, or with

837
00:42:45,422 --> 00:42:48,523
the expansions, the soulbound items that were pretty darn powerful.

838
00:42:50,444 --> 00:42:53,287
So at the end of this long and winding road,

839
00:42:53,287 --> 00:42:56,831
it's important to think about what you want to take

840
00:42:56,831 --> 00:42:59,493
from the games that inspire your retro classic

841
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:00,594
and what you want to leave behind,

842
00:43:00,594 --> 00:43:02,096
things that you're like, you know what,

843
00:43:02,096 --> 00:43:03,818
that might have worked then, but it's not working anymore.

844
00:43:04,447 --> 00:43:09,490
So, not every choice that you make when you're developing these games is going to actually

845
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:10,750
get at that soul.

846
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:15,753
It's really, really, I know, I mean this is really obvious, but like, play the game.

847
00:43:15,753 --> 00:43:19,855
You have a bunch of ingredients that are going into this mix.

848
00:43:20,395 --> 00:43:26,139
And if you're not like tasting the sauce every once in a while, you don't really know how that stuff is going together.

849
00:43:26,139 --> 00:43:30,262
It's very important also that you play the original games that inspired this passion,

850
00:43:30,262 --> 00:43:35,445
because then when you move from one to the other, you can see what things are actually improving the experience

851
00:43:35,445 --> 00:43:39,548
versus either not improving it or worse or detrimental to the experience.

852
00:43:40,168 --> 00:43:43,769
But everything that you're doing, you need to be able to grow for the future.

853
00:43:43,769 --> 00:43:47,509
So, unless your goal is really to make a game just for one small audience and then say,

854
00:43:47,509 --> 00:43:50,770
I'm never making a game again, or I'm never making a game like this again,

855
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:55,271
you do want to make something that you can improve on and build for the future.

856
00:43:55,271 --> 00:43:57,752
So that's something to always keep in mind.

857
00:43:57,752 --> 00:44:01,032
Don't back yourself into a corner with certain designer development choices.

858
00:44:01,032 --> 00:44:05,453
And the last point is, listen to as many of your players as you can.

859
00:44:05,453 --> 00:44:08,554
Obviously, you can only act on a small number of those people.

860
00:44:09,294 --> 00:44:15,837
But don't ignore the vocal minority, and also don't ignore the larger player base.

861
00:44:15,837 --> 00:44:18,439
They're all people who are interested in playing the game.

862
00:44:18,439 --> 00:44:21,540
Some of them are going to be louder and more persistent than others,

863
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:25,122
but if you believe you understand who your audience is,

864
00:44:25,122 --> 00:44:28,804
try to reach as many of those people as possible to make a game that they can all enjoy.

865
00:44:28,804 --> 00:44:29,444
I want to thank...

866
00:44:33,915 --> 00:44:37,457
My CEO and boss, Fergus Urquhart, for letting me go on this trip.

867
00:44:37,457 --> 00:44:38,017
It was a lot of fun.

868
00:44:38,017 --> 00:44:42,099
Kaz Aruga, who helped me collect a lot of art resources

869
00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:42,859
for making this talk.

870
00:44:42,859 --> 00:44:46,721
And of course, to all the Pillars of Eternity backers

871
00:44:46,721 --> 00:44:48,802
and players and fans, we literally

872
00:44:48,802 --> 00:44:51,583
would not have been able to make this game without them.

873
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:53,244
And their ongoing feedback and support

874
00:44:53,244 --> 00:44:56,205
is helping us make the game even better for the future.

875
00:44:56,205 --> 00:44:56,745
Thank you.

876
00:45:10,261 --> 00:45:11,101
What's that?

877
00:45:11,101 --> 00:45:11,942
Is there a queue at Q&A?

878
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:12,302
Cool.

879
00:45:12,302 --> 00:45:14,202
Does anyone have any questions?

880
00:45:14,202 --> 00:45:14,983
Hello?

881
00:45:14,983 --> 00:45:19,664
So you talked about how the game is inspired

882
00:45:19,664 --> 00:45:23,385
by D&D second edition and classical medieval fantasy,

883
00:45:23,385 --> 00:45:27,427
which I feel like we've been doing for a really long time.

884
00:45:27,427 --> 00:45:30,668
And as a tabletop player, you've probably

885
00:45:30,668 --> 00:45:32,848
been playing all sorts of diverse and interesting

886
00:45:32,848 --> 00:45:34,229
tabletop games.

887
00:45:34,229 --> 00:45:35,930
As a player or a designer, what kind

888
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:38,510
of these kind of mechanics would you

889
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:40,111
like to see us bringing into it?

890
00:45:41,092 --> 00:45:42,173
I'm sorry, could you?

891
00:45:42,173 --> 00:45:46,777
So we're still kind of riffing on D&D second edition,

892
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:49,800
and tabletop gaming has gotten so much bigger and more

893
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,303
interesting than that over the last 20 or 30 years.

894
00:45:52,303 --> 00:45:54,906
Is there any of those systems or mechanics

895
00:45:54,906 --> 00:45:56,988
that you'd like to see us bring into our computer games

896
00:45:56,988 --> 00:45:57,748
over the next while?

897
00:45:58,034 --> 00:46:08,157
Yes, so that's a great question. I think for this specific type of game, there are a lot of mechanics that I enjoy from other RPGs that I don't think would necessarily fit in here.

898
00:46:08,157 --> 00:46:17,400
For example, one aspect that I really like about Ars Magica is that it's based around a very long period of time. There's a lot of stuff that you do in downtime.

899
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:24,905
So every it's about wizards. It's about medieval wizards and you all have a covenant and the covenant is the place where you live and

900
00:46:24,905 --> 00:46:29,568
you protect it and it's important and you have a library and you have resources and

901
00:46:29,568 --> 00:46:34,111
Time is important and you read books to get more powerful reading is power

902
00:46:34,652 --> 00:46:43,234
That's all really cool, but there's a very, very big focus on sort of managing the Covenant and the Grogs and all these other things that go into it.

903
00:46:43,234 --> 00:46:47,795
I don't necessarily know that that's something that's appropriate for a D&D type game, but it's very cool.

904
00:46:47,795 --> 00:46:57,397
I will say though that if you've played the Darkest Dungeon, there are a lot of elements from there that are really similar to Torchbearer, if you've played Torchbearer.

905
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:58,238
Torchbearer has a...

906
00:46:58,238 --> 00:47:01,498
Imagine Torchbearer like low-level D&D, but...

907
00:47:02,116 --> 00:47:07,121
I'm sorry, imagine Torchbearer like low level first edition D&D, but harsher.

908
00:47:07,121 --> 00:47:12,125
It's really brutal, I mean that's sort of the darkest dungeon where everyone just spirals

909
00:47:12,125 --> 00:47:14,388
down into insanity and death.

910
00:47:14,388 --> 00:47:18,892
And so, and that's an example I think when you look at Torchbearer, the system design

911
00:47:18,892 --> 00:47:23,136
is so tightly oriented around capturing that feeling, that's very, very cool.

912
00:47:23,136 --> 00:47:25,758
Whereas I think when you look at something like D&D.

913
00:47:26,399 --> 00:47:29,340
D&D, it evolved out of tabletop miniatures gaming.

914
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:31,601
There's a lot of ideas and systems

915
00:47:31,601 --> 00:47:33,881
that are just not part of it, because the focus is really

916
00:47:33,881 --> 00:47:37,703
on these murder hobos that wander the world just acquiring

917
00:47:37,703 --> 00:47:38,283
power and loot.

918
00:47:38,283 --> 00:47:41,484
So yeah, there's a ton of really cool games

919
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:43,885
out there that I think we can borrow elements from.

920
00:47:43,885 --> 00:47:45,485
Any other questions?

921
00:47:52,395 --> 00:47:54,416
Hey.

922
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:57,638
When you designed the game, it seemed

923
00:47:57,638 --> 00:48:01,281
you had a pretty ambitious plan for the gold economy.

924
00:48:01,281 --> 00:48:04,103
There's a lot of trains going on, a lot of consumers,

925
00:48:04,103 --> 00:48:04,643
and so on.

926
00:48:04,643 --> 00:48:08,005
And in the final game, it feels still

927
00:48:08,005 --> 00:48:11,307
that the gold is really piling up.

928
00:48:11,307 --> 00:48:12,688
So how did that happen?

929
00:48:13,844 --> 00:48:17,746
How did the gold pile up? That's a good question. So when we

930
00:48:17,746 --> 00:48:22,008
started designing the game, we initially had some more sinks in

931
00:48:22,008 --> 00:48:26,610
the economy for where gold went. One of those was a durability

932
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:27,050
system.

933
00:48:27,907 --> 00:48:30,010
Ooh, people didn't like that.

934
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:33,573
That was something that Tim Cain and I worked on and proposed

935
00:48:33,573 --> 00:48:34,154
pretty early on.

936
00:48:34,154 --> 00:48:36,116
And we had a backer update about it.

937
00:48:36,116 --> 00:48:37,758
And there were, I mean, I won't say everyone.

938
00:48:37,758 --> 00:48:39,460
But there was a significant number

939
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:42,103
of people that were like, this doesn't feel D&D-ish.

940
00:48:42,103 --> 00:48:44,205
This doesn't feel like it belongs in an Infinity Engine

941
00:48:44,205 --> 00:48:44,906
game.

942
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:50,511
One thing that came out of that conversation is that a lot of folks on our forum said,

943
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:54,175
you know, I don't really care that much if I wind up with a ton of gold toward the end

944
00:48:54,175 --> 00:48:54,575
of the game.

945
00:48:54,575 --> 00:48:58,359
That being said, I think we could have done a better job balancing the economy.

946
00:48:58,359 --> 00:49:02,643
I think some of the higher level crafting recipes, like if you want to upgrade a weapon

947
00:49:02,643 --> 00:49:03,844
to the really high tiers...

948
00:49:04,124 --> 00:49:08,807
We could have had those cost a huge amount of copper, which would have been a big improvement.

949
00:49:08,807 --> 00:49:13,349
And the stronghold, even though it wasn't very compelling for a lot of people, people

950
00:49:13,349 --> 00:49:17,432
did buy those upgrades, and I think those upgrades probably could have served us better

951
00:49:17,432 --> 00:49:20,253
to have those high-end upgrades be very, very expensive.

952
00:49:20,253 --> 00:49:24,235
They don't necessarily have to be proportional as long as there is something of value that

953
00:49:24,235 --> 00:49:27,938
the player can buy and they feel like, oh, okay, there's something to actually look forward

954
00:49:27,938 --> 00:49:29,158
to spending my gold on.

955
00:49:29,158 --> 00:49:30,419
But no, that was our fault.

956
00:49:30,419 --> 00:49:32,460
We designed a few sinks.

957
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:37,945
people didn't like them. I think they're justified not liking

958
00:49:37,945 --> 00:49:40,587
them. And we didn't do a good job of fixing the economy later

959
00:49:40,587 --> 00:49:40,968
on.

960
00:49:40,968 --> 00:49:50,336
Thanks for the talk. Do you have some features that for one

961
00:49:50,336 --> 00:49:54,100
reason or another didn't make it in the final build?

962
00:49:55,312 --> 00:49:56,813
Game mechanics?

963
00:49:56,813 --> 00:49:59,595
Features or game mechanics that couldn't make it into the final build?

964
00:49:59,595 --> 00:50:01,916
What you wanted to build.

965
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:04,177
Yeah, there were a lot of...

966
00:50:04,177 --> 00:50:08,100
We wanted to have more diverse abilities for a lot of the characters.

967
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,521
People remember...

968
00:50:09,521 --> 00:50:12,702
There were a lot of really weird and wacky spells and things like that in D&D.

969
00:50:12,702 --> 00:50:13,463
And...

970
00:50:13,463 --> 00:50:17,385
I can't remember specific ones off the top of my head, but...

971
00:50:17,665 --> 00:50:19,926
If you look through the player's handbook as a developer,

972
00:50:19,926 --> 00:50:21,926
there's a lot of things in D&D where you go like,

973
00:50:21,926 --> 00:50:23,647
I don't know how I would ever implement that,

974
00:50:23,647 --> 00:50:26,027
or wow, that would be like a week of someone's time

975
00:50:26,027 --> 00:50:26,688
to implement that.

976
00:50:26,688 --> 00:50:28,808
So there are things like that that we wanted to put in

977
00:50:28,808 --> 00:50:30,488
where we're like, that's really cool,

978
00:50:30,488 --> 00:50:31,949
but it's just so expensive to put in.

979
00:50:31,949 --> 00:50:34,029
But then again, it is important to have

980
00:50:34,029 --> 00:50:35,530
at least some of that stuff.

981
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:38,210
By the way, so Adam Brennecke, who's our lead,

982
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:40,891
he's our executive producer and our lead programmer.

983
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:46,813
He hates rangers so much in our game because the animal companions complicate everything

984
00:50:46,813 --> 00:50:50,895
But the design of the class is sort of built around having that companion

985
00:50:50,895 --> 00:50:56,877
And so that's like so fundamental to it that it was important that no you like we just got to fix it

986
00:50:56,877 --> 00:50:59,178
We got to keep on going. This is kind of how the class works

987
00:50:59,738 --> 00:51:01,599
We did also want to have familiars in the game

988
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:03,660
so that wizards could have their own little dudes.

989
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:07,822
That made Adam's mind explode because he's like, oh, cool.

990
00:51:07,822 --> 00:51:09,763
We get to have two different types of animal companions

991
00:51:09,763 --> 00:51:11,824
for twice the bugs.

992
00:51:11,824 --> 00:51:14,305
So that felt less important for wizards,

993
00:51:14,305 --> 00:51:15,566
and so we didn't incorporate that.

994
00:51:15,566 --> 00:51:15,746
Thanks.

995
00:51:15,746 --> 00:51:16,146
Any other questions?

996
00:51:16,146 --> 00:51:16,346
All right.

997
00:51:16,346 --> 00:51:16,386
Oh.

998
00:51:28,531 --> 00:51:32,055
Actually, I have a question more about the tools you use to build a game.

999
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:37,720
Because if I looked at the Winter Nights, Infinity Engine games, or the Bethesda games,

1000
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,344
a lot of them use global variables and plain text files.

1001
00:51:41,344 --> 00:51:46,790
And I'm just wondering if when building a game like that, doesn't that cause a lot of problems,

1002
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:48,191
bugs which are difficult to trace?

1003
00:51:48,932 --> 00:51:53,175
Did you use any more custom solutions, something which

1004
00:51:53,175 --> 00:51:56,278
would validate that there are no bugs in the content,

1005
00:51:56,278 --> 00:51:59,080
like a missing global variable or something linking

1006
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,181
to something disappearing?

1007
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:04,172
So the question is about global variable tracking and things like that.

1008
00:52:04,172 --> 00:52:09,553
So we've tried to build better tools for tracking that stuff over time.

1009
00:52:09,553 --> 00:52:13,535
Most of our data editing used the built-in Unity tools, and that's something that we're

1010
00:52:13,535 --> 00:52:14,755
moving away from now.

1011
00:52:14,755 --> 00:52:17,776
Again, that goes back to file formats and accessibility.

1012
00:52:17,776 --> 00:52:20,357
We want our file formats to be very easy for people to edit.

1013
00:52:20,917 --> 00:52:26,082
But in terms of global variable tracking, we have our own tool set for writing dialogue.

1014
00:52:26,082 --> 00:52:32,008
Again, because Obsidian, Obsidian has, we put a lot of effort into writing and branching dialogues,

1015
00:52:32,008 --> 00:52:33,609
and also tracking quest states.

1016
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:37,493
So we actually have a quest tool that is specifically for setting up quest flow,

1017
00:52:37,493 --> 00:52:41,317
so you can see how the quest is supposed to actually develop over time.

1018
00:52:41,317 --> 00:52:45,081
And we have a testing tool that allows us to set those variables and track them better.

1019
00:52:45,421 --> 00:52:50,523
So we develop tools for the specific needs of making a very complex role-playing game

1020
00:52:50,523 --> 00:52:55,104
so we can sort of define and track those variables more easily and also test them more easily.

1021
00:52:55,104 --> 00:52:55,804
Does that answer your question?

1022
00:52:55,804 --> 00:52:56,124
Yeah, thank you.

1023
00:52:56,124 --> 00:52:56,764
Any last questions?

1024
00:52:56,764 --> 00:52:58,705
Alright, everyone, thank you very much for coming. I really appreciate it.
