00:00:07,777 --> 00:00:10,760
Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Skyrim speedrun.

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,042
My name is Brian Francis, and if you need to refer to me in the third person,

3
00:00:14,042 --> 00:00:16,624
my pronouns are he him.

4
00:00:16,624 --> 00:00:19,827
Today, we're going to be watching Bubbles Del Fuego do a speedrun of

5
00:00:19,827 --> 00:00:24,891
The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim, while former Bethesda 3D artist Jonah Loeb

6
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:29,435
commentates and tells the stories from his time at Bethesda.

7
00:00:29,435 --> 00:00:34,279
Bubbles, Jonah, would you mind introducing yourselves?

8
00:00:34,279 --> 00:00:34,839
Bubbles, go ahead.

9
00:00:34,839 --> 00:00:35,119
Oh, thank you.

10
00:00:35,945 --> 00:00:39,167
Yeah, I'm BubbleStuffFuego. I speedrun a lot of things.

11
00:00:39,167 --> 00:00:44,730
If you've ever seen that, I've done like probably eight different AAA titles at

12
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:50,013
GDQs before and at ESA and some stuff at like other publications and

13
00:00:50,013 --> 00:00:54,315
things and lots of fun for a long time including a lot of Bethesda games like

14
00:00:54,315 --> 00:00:58,417
Fallout 3, Fallout 4, Skyrim, Oblivion. Today we're doing Skyrim.

15
00:00:58,417 --> 00:01:02,460
Jonah did a lot of work in that game. You can introduce yourself, Jonah.

16
00:01:03,526 --> 00:01:04,226
Biggie Bubbles.

17
00:01:04,226 --> 00:01:05,427
Hello, everybody.

18
00:01:05,427 --> 00:01:07,088
My name is Jonah Loeb.

19
00:01:07,088 --> 00:01:09,570
I was a character artist at Bethesda Softworks

20
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,352
for seven years, where I made most of the creatures

21
00:01:13,352 --> 00:01:16,595
and monsters for games like Shimmering Isles,

22
00:01:16,595 --> 00:01:19,376
Fallout 3, Skyrim, and Fallout 4.

23
00:01:19,376 --> 00:01:21,658
And these days I'm doing my own thing.

24
00:01:21,658 --> 00:01:22,639
I do art education.

25
00:01:22,639 --> 00:01:27,041
I'm very active on Twitter and Instagram,

26
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:30,344
and I make a lot of art, traditional art or otherwise.

27
00:01:30,344 --> 00:01:31,564
And up until this year, I was...

28
00:01:32,247 --> 00:01:36,408
diving into attending cons, and then they all got canceled.

29
00:01:36,408 --> 00:01:38,069
What's a con? I don't even know anymore.

30
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:39,429
We're in a virtual conference.

31
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:39,870
I don't even know.

32
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,650
We apologize to Jonah for character artists,

33
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:43,471
not 3D artists, sorry.

34
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:44,971
Oh, no worries.

35
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:47,212
For those of you at home and chat,

36
00:01:47,212 --> 00:01:48,512
thank you for joining us.

37
00:01:48,512 --> 00:01:49,753
I'm seeing some faces in chat,

38
00:01:49,753 --> 00:01:52,533
like Melissa Sawicki and Ben Fried.

39
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:53,794
I just want to remind folks,

40
00:01:53,794 --> 00:01:55,374
feel free to ask questions for Jonah.

41
00:01:55,374 --> 00:01:56,615
I'll be grabbing them.

42
00:01:56,615 --> 00:01:58,735
If you want to know about his time at Bethesda,

43
00:01:58,735 --> 00:02:00,456
if you want to know about his art styles,

44
00:02:00,456 --> 00:02:00,996
go ahead and do that.

45
00:02:01,236 --> 00:02:06,000
So before Bubbles gets started running, I want to just sort of explain what we're doing.

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,403
Why are we doing a Skyrim speedrun? Speedrunning is an incredible aspect of the video game community.

47
00:02:11,403 --> 00:02:15,206
Runners get together to raise money for charity and take time to explore games in new and

48
00:02:15,206 --> 00:02:19,930
fascinating ways that elevate and explore all the hard work that went into them.

49
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,172
And sometimes they just break stuff and it's funny.

50
00:02:22,172 --> 00:02:27,737
The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim was one of the largest RPG releases of the century, to the

51
00:02:27,737 --> 00:02:31,441
point that we're probably going to see it ported to the PS5 and Xbox Series X.

52
00:02:31,441 --> 00:02:35,445
That's not confirmed news, that's just me speculating, but if I'm wrong, like,

53
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:40,869
I'll be very surprised to be wrong. Its system-driven design shows the incredible

54
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:44,672
craftsmanship of Bethesda Softworks, and of the games we're running this week,

55
00:02:44,672 --> 00:02:50,677
it's the one where the line between bug and feature is blurred even if you're not speedrunning the

56
00:02:50,677 --> 00:02:54,379
game. In Skyrim, you can live your own adventure, and sometimes that adventure involves running

57
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:56,401
around doing 360-degree spins.

58
00:02:56,641 --> 00:03:00,443
Again, Jonah will be taking your questions during the run, drop them in chat, and I'll

59
00:03:00,443 --> 00:03:01,904
be pulling them for him.

60
00:03:01,904 --> 00:03:07,547
For that, you can also ask questions for Bubbles if you're a dev and you want to know how runners

61
00:03:07,547 --> 00:03:08,748
approach games like this.

62
00:03:08,748 --> 00:03:11,409
With that, let's get started.

63
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:14,951
Bubbles, blow our minds.

64
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:18,173
Hi, I'm here and I'm right in the animation.

65
00:03:19,045 --> 00:03:24,186
area the art there's Jonah character oh we got the nose we got the credits yeah

66
00:03:24,186 --> 00:03:29,627
ah snuggled right comfortably comfortably in the middle I've never never checked there before

67
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:36,668
all right uh all right so there's a long cart ride in the beginning of Skyrim and um and then

68
00:03:36,668 --> 00:03:41,649
you have to create a character which is pretty specific to the run so um a high elf is nice

69
00:03:41,649 --> 00:03:46,310
because they're tall and there's a ratio between height and uh movement speed in the game um

70
00:03:47,358 --> 00:03:48,919
as of course, as we all know.

71
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:53,504
I think it's something to do with how long their legs are,

72
00:03:53,504 --> 00:03:54,885
honestly, it's like their stride.

73
00:03:54,885 --> 00:03:56,706
And it's funny because like in Oblivion,

74
00:03:56,706 --> 00:03:58,728
you would think like the wood elf would be fast

75
00:03:58,728 --> 00:04:02,031
because it's, you know, it's their type of character,

76
00:04:02,031 --> 00:04:04,794
but they're really short, so they're not really.

77
00:04:04,794 --> 00:04:08,477
And so on, so the high elf is fast.

78
00:04:08,477 --> 00:04:11,220
And so things will get started immediately,

79
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,662
as you can tell by the thumbnail of the save file.

80
00:04:14,686 --> 00:04:18,187
We just finished making the character and as soon as you gain movement speed,

81
00:04:18,187 --> 00:04:20,148
your head gets off of the chopping block.

82
00:04:20,148 --> 00:04:26,690
Um, and I guess we'll immediately jump into the face of the dragon that Jonah

83
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:30,291
designed and so things start off really fast.

84
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:34,812
So I'm just going to start off with an infinite running glitch.

85
00:04:34,812 --> 00:04:40,994
And, uh, by preserving my run speed through a quick saves and quick loads

86
00:04:40,994 --> 00:04:43,935
and, um, and then get out of here.

87
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:45,441
Right on, let's do it.

88
00:04:45,441 --> 00:04:47,102
So you can start the timer, I guess.

89
00:04:47,102 --> 00:04:47,682
I guess I'll run a timer.

90
00:04:47,682 --> 00:04:48,082
We didn't.

91
00:04:48,082 --> 00:04:50,323
Oh, yeah, it doesn't speed or not.

92
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:51,804
You don't have to.

93
00:04:51,804 --> 00:04:54,004
It'll look a lot better if you don't.

94
00:04:54,004 --> 00:04:54,405
Oh, yeah.

95
00:04:54,405 --> 00:04:58,326
Yeah, you're going to break the world record.

96
00:04:58,326 --> 00:04:59,947
All right, there's the dragon.

97
00:04:59,947 --> 00:05:03,388
There's the wing and we're gone.

98
00:05:03,388 --> 00:05:03,988
Whoa, already.

99
00:05:03,988 --> 00:05:04,488
I'm shocked.

100
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:11,298
You know, Jonah, when we were doing pre-show for this, you said you laugh whenever people tell you

101
00:05:11,298 --> 00:05:16,445
about Skyrim bugs because you've played, quote, the buggiest version of all Bethesda games,

102
00:05:16,445 --> 00:05:22,233
because obviously you're playing them before release. And this still beats your expectations,

103
00:05:22,233 --> 00:05:22,633
I guess.

104
00:05:24,021 --> 00:05:29,385
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it's very funny to watch other people encounter all these bugs. And you're

105
00:05:29,385 --> 00:05:35,110
right, the line between bug and feature is so thin with Bethesda games. I think people understand

106
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:41,435
that these games are so big and so complicated. It was so many different variables that a million

107
00:05:41,435 --> 00:05:42,596
different things can happen wrong.

108
00:05:43,313 --> 00:05:45,914
And so there is an enhanced level of acceptance

109
00:05:45,914 --> 00:05:48,195
on the community's part.

110
00:05:48,195 --> 00:05:51,455
But for that, we would like to thank the community

111
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:55,196
because not a lot of games would get past

112
00:05:55,196 --> 00:05:58,977
that certain hallmark of bugginess.

113
00:05:58,977 --> 00:06:01,358
But yeah, I mean, I'm always impressed

114
00:06:01,358 --> 00:06:03,018
to see the new ones that are there,

115
00:06:03,018 --> 00:06:08,219
but I will not, I just can't bring myself

116
00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:09,700
to feel that bad about them, you know?

117
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,160
Because they're what they are.

118
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,000
Ooh, I posed that skeleton.

119
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:19,074
How neat was it playing this game and sort of seeing your own models just pop up every time?

120
00:06:19,074 --> 00:06:22,477
Like a brief like hey, it's me

121
00:06:22,477 --> 00:06:23,958
Yeah a little bit a little bit

122
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:29,223
It's funny cuz today I see the thing and then I kind of remember I have a flashback to work in there to the time

123
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:34,627
I was being in the thing and and of course as an artist I see something also, but I'm like, oh, I wish I I

124
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:38,370
Wish I'd done that better, you know, I wish I'd like man if I can go back, you know

125
00:06:39,078 --> 00:06:43,379
Yeah, um, I have a question for bubbles while you're running. It

126
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:46,700
comes from Dom Harrison chat. What can a dev do to aid this

127
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:50,461
speedrunning community for their game? They the Dom says, Oh, we

128
00:06:50,461 --> 00:06:53,262
can add split, you know, split timers and things like that. But

129
00:06:53,262 --> 00:06:56,423
bubbles. Is there anything else you would want Dom dad to their

130
00:06:56,423 --> 00:06:56,503
game?

131
00:06:56,503 --> 00:06:58,043
I guess like

132
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:11,297
Trying to make your game good for a speedrun is like, it never works.

133
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:14,139
Like whenever someone is like, I love speed running.

134
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:15,980
So I made a game that's perfect for speedruns.

135
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,341
Like that's, that's not really how it works.

136
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:23,624
It's like trying to make the best movie ever, you know, it, it, you can't,

137
00:07:23,624 --> 00:07:28,086
you can't plan it, you know, sometimes there's a little bit of a suggestion to

138
00:07:28,086 --> 00:07:31,108
it, like portals are really awesome speed run and it's of course got like

139
00:07:31,108 --> 00:07:32,269
a speed run mode built in.

140
00:07:33,423 --> 00:07:37,286
So it's, you know, it's not really a big surprise, but...

141
00:07:37,286 --> 00:07:39,048
I just want to point out that in the run,

142
00:07:39,048 --> 00:07:44,093
we just watched you wait a specific amount of time to get a specific horse,

143
00:07:44,093 --> 00:07:47,156
which is just, that's just never how I think about playing these games.

144
00:07:47,156 --> 00:07:50,178
And the horse is vertical.

145
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,740
And you're gone.

146
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:51,840
Um...

147
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,362
Oh boy, oh boy.

148
00:07:54,362 --> 00:07:54,963
That's the troll.

149
00:07:54,963 --> 00:07:57,025
Oh my goodness.

150
00:07:57,025 --> 00:07:59,067
I don't even understand what I'm seeing right now.

151
00:08:00,986 --> 00:08:03,867
Let me work for Bethesda, I'll find this stuff.

152
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:04,648
Wow.

153
00:08:04,648 --> 00:08:05,028
Wow.

154
00:08:05,028 --> 00:08:08,950
With this, I guess the thing about speed running is so often is,

155
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,672
is you're, you're finding ways to break the game, you know?

156
00:08:12,672 --> 00:08:15,453
And yeah, it's pretty amazing.

157
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:15,613
Yeah.

158
00:08:15,613 --> 00:08:17,834
And there's a lot of different ways, just even just what happened just now,

159
00:08:17,834 --> 00:08:21,636
running so fast, the geometry of the setting couldn't load in.

160
00:08:21,997 --> 00:08:25,361
I've had that happen, you know, I remember I was testing Fallout 3.

161
00:08:25,361 --> 00:08:28,144
Oh, I posed that jogger as well.

162
00:08:28,144 --> 00:08:33,369
I was testing Fallout 3 and I posed that troll.

163
00:08:35,907 --> 00:08:40,489
And I was running and running and running and the landscape became more and more barren around me.

164
00:08:40,489 --> 00:08:45,953
And I thought I was entering a very small, very isolated area. And I kind of just finally stop

165
00:08:45,953 --> 00:08:49,495
on this one dark patch of earth. And I'm like, what? There's nothing around me. What's going on?

166
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:54,578
And then the house just like loads around me, but not the interior of a house, just the exterior

167
00:08:54,578 --> 00:08:58,161
model, but the inside of that model. And then I was just stuck. And I was like, oh, I get it.

168
00:08:58,161 --> 00:09:03,664
The whole landscape had not loaded. I get it. Okay. So it's everywhere. They're everywhere.

169
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:10,606
Also, also remember that this is, you know, 2011 was nine years ago.

170
00:09:10,606 --> 00:09:14,727
And so a lot of these, you know, it's, it's, things are not quite, I think, I

171
00:09:14,727 --> 00:09:18,908
think there was, there's this greater tension between hardware and software,

172
00:09:18,908 --> 00:09:22,209
you know, and what could, what could run what?

173
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:24,309
So, yeah, I'm in combat.

174
00:09:24,309 --> 00:09:25,090
This is really weird.

175
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,610
Oh, is it affecting your run?

176
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:32,772
I mean, it's not going to be a problem, but I was just like, oh, that's interesting.

177
00:09:33,164 --> 00:09:36,488
Jonah, we're going to pull some questions from chat for you.

178
00:09:36,488 --> 00:09:37,670
Please.

179
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:41,575
From Lori Warfield, would like to know, when you were working on Skyrim,

180
00:09:41,575 --> 00:09:45,480
did you have a favorite character or prop that you worked on?

181
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,862
Lori, thanks for asking that question.

182
00:09:46,862 --> 00:09:48,404
Did I have a favorite character or prop?

183
00:09:48,978 --> 00:09:52,199
I was really proud of the giants.

184
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:55,680
You know, my intention with them was to create something

185
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,261
that did not inspire desire to just murder.

186
00:09:59,261 --> 00:10:02,822
I wanted, you know, what I really like about designing creatures

187
00:10:02,822 --> 00:10:04,803
and characters and monsters is creating

188
00:10:04,803 --> 00:10:12,445
something that will stir the imagination. To me that's more important

189
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,845
than just creating something

190
00:10:14,545 --> 00:10:17,349
that the player wants to click and kill and kill.

191
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:19,591
So I really enjoyed doing the Giants

192
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:22,775
because they seem very human.

193
00:10:22,775 --> 00:10:26,559
I really enjoyed Alduin's final form,

194
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,023
although the process of getting there gave me tendinitis.

195
00:10:30,023 --> 00:10:31,765
I was working so hard and so many extra hours.

196
00:10:32,462 --> 00:10:34,203
And I really liked the Draugr.

197
00:10:34,203 --> 00:10:35,824
They just...

198
00:10:35,824 --> 00:10:41,087
Sometimes the most effort should be put into the things that you see the most.

199
00:10:41,087 --> 00:10:43,808
Not even the biggest assets, but the most common ones.

200
00:10:43,808 --> 00:10:46,270
You know, the Goombas of the world.

201
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,631
Yeah, that makes sense.

202
00:10:48,631 --> 00:10:51,233
Our next question comes from Josh Good.

203
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,794
What type of art pipeline did Bethesda have during Skyrim's development?

204
00:10:54,794 --> 00:10:58,637
How heavily was engineering involved to assist artists in building the tools where needed?

205
00:11:00,438 --> 00:11:02,159
It's a good question, Josh.

206
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:05,502
The art process was generally, we

207
00:11:05,502 --> 00:11:06,863
worked from a concept sketch.

208
00:11:06,863 --> 00:11:09,105
That's my mammoth.

209
00:11:09,105 --> 00:11:11,447
Concept sketch to a 3D model, and then we

210
00:11:11,447 --> 00:11:14,950
iterate from there and then create the final.

211
00:11:16,989 --> 00:11:22,472
model. Now some things like the Spriggan that I created, I worked not with engineering per

212
00:11:22,472 --> 00:11:28,296
se, but with a world artist, an effects artist named Mark Tier, and we kind of collaborated

213
00:11:28,296 --> 00:11:40,264
on creating this almost like a beehive effect with the kind of the buzzing lights everywhere.

214
00:11:40,264 --> 00:11:41,044
So we...

215
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:47,852
We didn't collaborate as much with engineering as I would have liked all the time.

216
00:11:47,852 --> 00:11:52,154
But I definitely, whenever there's a particular character or creature or something that is,

217
00:11:52,154 --> 00:11:57,936
has, that needs these special things, like, like, like the Spergen, you know, with, with glows on,

218
00:11:57,936 --> 00:12:02,438
you know, whenever we get the idea that whenever she brings out her claws, they light up green,

219
00:12:02,438 --> 00:12:07,280
that kind of thing. That's when a direct collaboration is for sure encouraged.

220
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,501
But I think people also frequently...

221
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,489
overestimate the size of Bethesda Softworks, the manpower there.

222
00:12:15,489 --> 00:12:21,020
During Skyrim's creation, I think on average over the course of the project, I think we had

223
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:27,795
9500 people on the team. And so there's not as much bandwidth,

224
00:12:27,795 --> 00:12:30,157
usually, as you want to be able to collaborate back and forth

225
00:12:30,157 --> 00:12:32,640
on things. And not everything can be given all the same

226
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,944
amount of attention because the world is just massive. But I for

227
00:12:37,944 --> 00:12:39,846
sure, and I know myself and others

228
00:12:41,903 --> 00:12:44,544
we're very certain that when something required that attention,

229
00:12:44,544 --> 00:12:46,844
we would get it from our desk,

230
00:12:46,844 --> 00:12:49,705
walk across the building and talk to a programmer and try to get,

231
00:12:49,705 --> 00:12:51,005
or a level designer or whoever,

232
00:12:51,005 --> 00:12:55,566
and try to get that support and feedback and collaboration.

233
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:59,488
Because the best things in game design happen when people work together to make

234
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:00,408
something cool.

235
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,565
Right on, yeah, and that's so different in a world now where I think more, I don't know quite what the state of ZeniMax is.

236
00:13:06,565 --> 00:13:14,233
ZeniMax has owned so many studios now, and I think Bethesda is still, from my understanding, Bethesda Softworks itself is still pretty siloed,

237
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:20,180
but they're not the only company, you know, so many games now ship with the help of not just, you know, multiple internal studios,

238
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,763
but external studios too with contracting and such.

239
00:13:23,352 --> 00:13:27,677
uh... yes that's my peanut gallery comfort uh... walls that's correct i

240
00:13:27,677 --> 00:13:28,998
think in the picture

241
00:13:28,998 --> 00:13:31,200
in the background bubbles continues to just

242
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,763
roll through like a demon

243
00:13:33,763 --> 00:13:37,307
uh... in this massive world over the slow animation of getting a car

244
00:13:37,307 --> 00:13:39,169
which i'll linger on for just a moment

245
00:13:39,169 --> 00:13:42,993
uh... a question from someone named carly velocity

246
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:47,534
who's sitting in the room with me, says,

247
00:13:47,534 --> 00:13:49,876
I've never known a single person who finished Skyrim

248
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:54,159
since it's so easy to get lost doing side missions.

249
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:56,781
Have either of you actually finished Skyrim?

250
00:13:56,781 --> 00:14:01,545
And that's for both Bubbles and Jonah.

251
00:14:01,545 --> 00:14:02,466
I didn't at first.

252
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,427
I mean, like, same thing with Oblivion,

253
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:07,930
just like Thieves Guild, Dark Brotherhood,

254
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,353
side stuff, and then you're out of there.

255
00:14:11,353 --> 00:14:11,633
Yeah.

256
00:14:12,884 --> 00:14:16,368
I did not.

257
00:14:16,368 --> 00:14:23,398
I, you know, because most of the time I spent playing that game was pre-shipping.

258
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,623
so much of my job for the months and months and months after production had started and we were

259
00:14:29,623 --> 00:14:39,531
just ironing out bugs and polishing and massaging things into place, my job was to just play the

260
00:14:39,531 --> 00:14:46,617
game and report books and do little fixes on this and that. And so very frequently,

261
00:14:46,617 --> 00:14:51,081
I got very far, but very frequently you get quite far with a character, you really fall

262
00:14:51,081 --> 00:14:53,983
in love with it and everything. And then they'd say, well, you know what, enough things have

263
00:14:53,983 --> 00:14:54,343
changed now.

264
00:14:54,907 --> 00:14:58,067
that we're starting a fresh build and you need to you need to start a fresh build

265
00:14:58,067 --> 00:15:00,088
if you're going to continue to do this.

266
00:15:00,088 --> 00:15:04,408
And so enough stops and starts over the course of the playtesting.

267
00:15:04,408 --> 00:15:07,189
And I just wasn't I just never got around to finishing it,

268
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:09,409
which is funny because I never got to see my own

269
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,650
Alduin like love, like get killed.

270
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:17,931
But I created the whalebone bridge, everything in Sovngarde.

271
00:15:17,931 --> 00:15:21,452
And, you know, and I've I've watched videos of it,

272
00:15:21,452 --> 00:15:24,732
but I never actually played it and I never got that far.

273
00:15:25,805 --> 00:15:26,189
Right on.

274
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:32,723
I love that For Whatever Reason Bubbles keeps reloading this horse speed glitch.

275
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:40,329
And so every time we see his hero run through the world like this, it is appropriate because

276
00:15:40,329 --> 00:15:45,092
someone in chat put in Green Hill Zone theme starts playing, which is a reference to Sonic

277
00:15:45,092 --> 00:15:46,013
the Hedgehog, of course.

278
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:50,857
So we don't have that music on hand, but if you in the chat would like to just picture

279
00:15:50,857 --> 00:15:54,779
that in your head while this little guy runs around that this is Sonic the Hedgehog in

280
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:55,860
Skyrim, you can do that.

281
00:15:57,124 --> 00:16:03,507
Um, Jonah, Ben Free would like to say that they love your pen

282
00:16:03,507 --> 00:16:06,788
and ink illustration and the splash of golden red.

283
00:16:06,788 --> 00:16:08,649
Thank you. Thanks very much.

284
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:11,150
What's going on in the run here before I do anything interesting

285
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:15,012
looks like we're doing some fast traveling.

286
00:16:15,012 --> 00:16:18,553
Ben just you know, I just I recently got this larger print

287
00:16:18,553 --> 00:16:21,834
of a print of mine done like literally came in just last

288
00:16:21,834 --> 00:16:24,976
week. So that one turned out pretty good. It's a nice print.

289
00:16:24,976 --> 00:16:25,496
The nice print.

290
00:16:27,641 --> 00:16:30,744
Jonah, are there any particular challenges, this question comes from Melissa Sawicki,

291
00:16:30,744 --> 00:16:34,387
are there any particular challenges you have when working on character art for different

292
00:16:34,387 --> 00:16:36,068
iterations of an existing IP?

293
00:16:36,068 --> 00:16:41,893
That's a good question, Melissa.

294
00:16:42,743 --> 00:16:50,747
So since I've worked at Bethesda and moved on to contract work and freelance work, I do make

295
00:16:50,747 --> 00:16:54,788
assets for different kinds of games. And, you know, so for instance, I've worked for a little

296
00:16:54,788 --> 00:17:00,911
while on the System Shock remake. At the moment I'm working on Crowfall, which is coming out

297
00:17:00,911 --> 00:17:07,935
shortly. And essentially it requires different art styles. And so it really, you know, I try

298
00:17:07,935 --> 00:17:10,736
to be careful because I think, you know, in a game like Skyrim...

299
00:17:11,932 --> 00:17:15,653
When I worked on Fallout 3, for instance, I was able to really polish up my abilities

300
00:17:15,653 --> 00:17:19,514
in character design and character art and the workflow there at Bethesda.

301
00:17:19,514 --> 00:17:25,656
And then with Skyrim, I was really able to unleash my artistic self and be the artist

302
00:17:25,656 --> 00:17:32,638
that I wanted to be. So then my art style then contributed to Skyrim's art style.

303
00:17:32,638 --> 00:17:37,940
So going on to other projects, then I actually have to be cognizant of the fact that my art style

304
00:17:39,788 --> 00:17:41,149
it might not be theirs.

305
00:17:41,149 --> 00:17:43,352
And so I often try to spend a lot of time

306
00:17:43,352 --> 00:17:46,555
trying to pay special attention to the art style

307
00:17:46,555 --> 00:17:48,697
they have going on in that, in their own game,

308
00:17:48,697 --> 00:17:53,142
and really try to, and I'll ask the art directors,

309
00:17:53,142 --> 00:17:55,384
you know, for feedback on like, what matters?

310
00:17:55,384 --> 00:17:56,766
What's important?

311
00:17:56,766 --> 00:17:58,147
What do you guys rely on?

312
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:02,979
can you give me some color swatches that you use a lot, that kind of thing, because

313
00:18:02,979 --> 00:18:08,863
as much as I like doing my own thing, it's really important to listen to employers and really figure

314
00:18:08,863 --> 00:18:14,847
out what is important to them, what they're trying to prioritize in their own game, and really lean

315
00:18:14,847 --> 00:18:21,172
in that direction. So yeah, it can be quite complicated trying to adapt to different

316
00:18:21,172 --> 00:18:23,453
gameplay styles, but I think it's really important.

317
00:18:24,284 --> 00:18:30,687
to do that both for client happiness and as an artist and as a game designer, it behooves

318
00:18:30,687 --> 00:18:35,749
me to try new things and to learn other people's new techniques and to stretch my own styles

319
00:18:35,749 --> 00:18:42,231
because a lot of aspects of art, no matter what the art style is in particular, are similar

320
00:18:42,231 --> 00:18:43,632
from game to game to game to game.

321
00:18:43,632 --> 00:18:46,193
You know, ideas like shape, line, form, color.

322
00:18:46,853 --> 00:18:49,736
these things all have a unique kind of visual power,

323
00:18:49,736 --> 00:18:52,839
but the way they're used becomes the language,

324
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:54,381
the visual language of that game.

325
00:18:54,381 --> 00:19:01,608
And so I definitely try to put a lot of emphasis on whatever they deem to be important,

326
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:03,230
and I try to head in that direction.

327
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,932
That's such a cool answer.

328
00:19:04,932 --> 00:19:07,875
Bubbles, where the heck are you?

329
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:12,975
Do you even know?

330
00:19:12,975 --> 00:19:13,255
There we go.

331
00:19:13,255 --> 00:19:16,116
Uh, yeah, I'm, uh, in Helgen right now.

332
00:19:16,116 --> 00:19:19,817
I'm in the beginning of the game.

333
00:19:19,817 --> 00:19:21,418
Gotcha.

334
00:19:21,418 --> 00:19:24,018
Um, let's see here.

335
00:19:24,018 --> 00:19:24,639
Go ahead.

336
00:19:24,639 --> 00:19:25,619
I'm with us.

337
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:26,119
Go for it.

338
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:34,762
And now we're going to Riverwood to meet up with Delphine and he's going to

339
00:19:34,762 --> 00:19:38,883
have that conversation about, uh, about, you know, here's the dragon born.

340
00:19:38,883 --> 00:19:39,983
The dragons are back.

341
00:19:41,302 --> 00:19:44,342
And they go in that, you know, meeting in the end.

342
00:19:44,342 --> 00:19:44,622
Roger that.

343
00:19:44,622 --> 00:19:44,862
Yeah.

344
00:19:44,862 --> 00:19:46,723
I remember this is one of the, it's funny.

345
00:19:46,723 --> 00:19:51,124
You were just in a conversation a second ago and I'm sitting here going, I have

346
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:53,704
no memory of this, of this conversation.

347
00:19:53,704 --> 00:19:57,505
And now you're at a point where I'm like, oh yeah, I've played this 20 times.

348
00:19:57,505 --> 00:19:59,745
For all the times that you restart Skyrim, just cause you're like, I feel

349
00:19:59,745 --> 00:20:01,346
like changing things up today.

350
00:20:01,346 --> 00:20:04,986
Um, uh, what's your Jonah, what's your favorite software for

351
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:06,387
character and prop development?

352
00:20:08,318 --> 00:20:13,481
I would say my favorite software is ZBrush.

353
00:20:13,481 --> 00:20:18,984
I think it's definitely a program with a steep learning curve, but I think if it wasn't

354
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:23,606
for this program, I'd have had a lot harder time getting into the industry.

355
00:20:23,606 --> 00:20:27,388
And I think knowing ZBrush was one of the things that got me a job at Bethesda.

356
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:33,136
Because at the time it was still a new program and a lot of people didn't know it even there.

357
00:20:33,136 --> 00:20:37,518
And it's just really cool for like modeling and sculpting.

358
00:20:37,518 --> 00:20:41,741
You know, I think I'm probably my own work is best known for all the little detail I

359
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,002
put into the surface of things and all that.

360
00:20:44,002 --> 00:20:48,264
You know, the jogger, the giants, the mammoth, the dragon priest, et cetera, et cetera.

361
00:20:48,264 --> 00:20:52,386
And a lot of that comes through in this program called ZBrush, which is basically just a sculpting

362
00:20:52,386 --> 00:20:53,807
program.

363
00:20:53,807 --> 00:20:56,748
And so as somebody like me who is.

364
00:20:57,269 --> 00:21:03,692
I'm very art-centric and technically speaking, I'm pretty garbage when it comes to talent.

365
00:21:03,692 --> 00:21:08,994
I was definitely probably the worst at computers at Bethesda Softworks,

366
00:21:08,994 --> 00:21:14,937
excepting the concept artists who didn't have to do anything with computers if they didn't want to.

367
00:21:14,937 --> 00:21:23,621
It was definitely a really nice entree for me into the game world, being able to sculpt and

368
00:21:23,621 --> 00:21:25,482
think about things from this perspective.

369
00:21:26,307 --> 00:21:30,953
3D perspective. Oh, the Wabbajack. I made that.

370
00:21:30,953 --> 00:21:35,058
Oh, you made the Wabbajack? I did. I did. We didn't know we had no concept art for it.

371
00:21:35,058 --> 00:21:37,221
And so I just asked. That's so much cooler than a dragon.

372
00:21:37,221 --> 00:21:42,547
I asked the concept, I asked one of the designers, I was like, do we have any,

373
00:21:42,547 --> 00:21:44,910
I'm supposed to do the Wabbajack. Do we have any concept art for it?

374
00:21:45,954 --> 00:21:47,075
And they said, no, not really.

375
00:21:47,075 --> 00:21:48,676
And so I was like, well, you know,

376
00:21:48,676 --> 00:21:50,817
one of the first things I ever did at Bethesda Softworks

377
00:21:50,817 --> 00:21:54,260
was I made the three faced Shiogoroth,

378
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,381
like gateway to the Shivering Isles.

379
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:59,563
That was one of the first things I did at that company.

380
00:21:59,563 --> 00:22:03,486
And so I was like, I'll just use those three faces

381
00:22:03,486 --> 00:22:06,148
and just use those to create the staff.

382
00:22:06,148 --> 00:22:06,848
So it came together well.

383
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,909
I made the Spriggan Matron as well.

384
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:11,231
Bubbles, you just passed through one of my favorite areas

385
00:22:11,231 --> 00:22:13,873
from Skyrim, that artifact, like Quest in the North.

386
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:20,522
Yeah, we just go through that whole glimmer system backwards. Yeah.

387
00:22:20,522 --> 00:22:25,567
So we're just going to go to the elevator that we leave.

388
00:22:25,567 --> 00:22:29,131
Wow. Every time you come back to this horse,

389
00:22:29,131 --> 00:22:32,034
I swear, like my brain just breaks a little.

390
00:22:32,034 --> 00:22:37,840
Yeah, I don't even understand. This is so confusing.

391
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,841
Well, I may crash.

392
00:22:39,413 --> 00:22:42,834
I'll ask you to explain. I made that troll as well.

393
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:46,156
I'll ask you to explain exactly how this horse elevator works later

394
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,157
when you're not speedrunner.

395
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:53,820
Yeah, I gotta close the program. It's the second crash of the month so far.

396
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,280
Oh yeah.

397
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:58,502
Whenever it's a black screen, it's not my visuals cutting out or something.

398
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,623
It's a feature.

399
00:23:00,623 --> 00:23:04,105
It's a, well, it's something. It's not a feature, not a bug.

400
00:23:04,105 --> 00:23:04,765
It just works.

401
00:23:04,765 --> 00:23:06,326
It's Skyrim.

402
00:23:06,326 --> 00:23:07,026
It just works.

403
00:23:09,002 --> 00:23:14,085
Um, uh, David, uh, Boston Hardy, um, says they remember that door.

404
00:23:14,085 --> 00:23:17,307
I don't even know what we've been like stuck at like five doors by now.

405
00:23:17,307 --> 00:23:19,549
Um, and it sure slows down the speed run.

406
00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:22,851
Um, let's see if there are any other fun questions from chat.

407
00:23:22,851 --> 00:23:25,032
Uh, remember to keep them coming folks.

408
00:23:25,032 --> 00:23:25,953
Cause yeah.

409
00:23:25,953 --> 00:23:26,093
Yeah.

410
00:23:26,093 --> 00:23:27,654
Anybody can chat, please.

411
00:23:27,654 --> 00:23:27,934
Please.

412
00:23:27,934 --> 00:23:28,574
Deliver from you.

413
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:32,817
Not that we don't love just like reacting to the elevator, the horse elevator.

414
00:23:32,817 --> 00:23:33,838
Did you make this moose?

415
00:23:33,838 --> 00:23:35,499
I did not make them this now.

416
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:37,400
Oh, who made the moose?

417
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:37,560
Uh, I.

418
00:23:40,015 --> 00:23:42,318
I am not sure. I don't remember. I don't know.

419
00:23:42,318 --> 00:23:44,100
Whoever made the moose, thank you.

420
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,722
It's a glorious moose.

421
00:23:45,722 --> 00:23:46,663
Look at that ragdoll go.

422
00:23:46,663 --> 00:23:54,231
I'm trying to fly from the stables into the Mazark shaft.

423
00:23:54,231 --> 00:23:56,574
The temple, I don't remember the name of it exactly, but.

424
00:23:58,851 --> 00:24:03,832
Um, Jonah, here's an interesting question from, uh, if you have unlimited funding for a patch

425
00:24:03,832 --> 00:24:08,293
and one month to finish it, um, what would you choose to improve? I guess this is interesting

426
00:24:08,293 --> 00:24:15,015
because you're specifically referring to, um, to character art here is what we're discussing, but

427
00:24:15,015 --> 00:24:17,636
you know, everyone wants to improve their, their work all the time.

428
00:24:17,636 --> 00:24:22,477
If I can have a patch having to do with character art.

429
00:24:22,477 --> 00:24:25,498
Yeah, that would improve something you worked on. You go, man, I wish I could update that.

430
00:24:26,452 --> 00:24:28,194
Um, man, that's a great question.

431
00:24:28,194 --> 00:24:31,777
Um, I would like to update Alduin's texture.

432
00:24:31,777 --> 00:24:35,680
I think, I think it could use, it could use some, some love.

433
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,804
I've actually, I've actually, um, made a remastered version that I've put up

434
00:24:39,804 --> 00:24:43,447
on art station that you can, that people can see, um, if they want, but

435
00:24:43,447 --> 00:24:44,528
I would love to get that updated.

436
00:24:44,968 --> 00:24:50,291
And actually, you know, the patch that I would want wouldn't even be my art.

437
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:53,073
Not that I don't have a ton of art that would need it.

438
00:24:53,073 --> 00:24:54,794
It would be on the animation system.

439
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:58,916
I would love, because I think an artist is sometimes only as good as the animation system

440
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:00,877
that the character is based on.

441
00:25:00,877 --> 00:25:08,882
And so I would love to see some really fluid, smooth animations of these characters because,

442
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,703
you know, I literally could improve like.

443
00:25:11,397 --> 00:25:15,681
There's literally things I would like to improve on every single creature, but I think that

444
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:21,526
what would really give us the most bang for the buck would be to see all these things

445
00:25:21,526 --> 00:25:23,188
move more fluidly, all that.

446
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:23,828
And again, it's...

447
00:25:24,785 --> 00:25:26,586
Skyrim was made by a team of 100.

448
00:25:26,586 --> 00:25:29,368
And so it's like, when you look at it again,

449
00:25:29,368 --> 00:25:31,090
like Assassin's Creed,

450
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:33,952
even the original Assassin's Creed was made

451
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,893
by a team of about 400.

452
00:25:34,893 --> 00:25:35,753
And so it's just,

453
00:25:35,753 --> 00:25:37,775
and almost exclusively,

454
00:25:37,775 --> 00:25:40,437
they're all animating people and movements.

455
00:25:40,437 --> 00:25:42,659
So there's so much fluidity and so much room

456
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:46,542
for just like realism and interaction, et cetera,

457
00:25:46,542 --> 00:25:47,623
in those games.

458
00:25:47,623 --> 00:25:48,924
And then a place like Bethesda,

459
00:25:48,924 --> 00:25:49,865
at the time we had like,

460
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:56,185
five animators and they all had to and there's like there's dragons and there was mammoth and

461
00:25:56,185 --> 00:26:00,788
there was a zillion non-human things um to animate and so there wasn't there wasn't the

462
00:26:00,788 --> 00:26:07,452
resources that we could dedicate um to really enriching that system and i would love i would

463
00:26:07,452 --> 00:26:12,455
just love one day to see that. Bubbles congrats on making it to the watchtower. Hey thanks.

464
00:26:12,455 --> 00:26:17,258
Even though it took like 10 tries it was still 10 times faster than

465
00:26:18,053 --> 00:26:21,214
going through Blackreach and all that stuff.

466
00:26:21,214 --> 00:26:21,294
Yeah.

467
00:26:21,294 --> 00:26:21,814
Blackreach was just actually,

468
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:25,716
it wasn't even like necessarily part of the plan,

469
00:26:25,716 --> 00:26:27,276
I don't think, I think it was just created

470
00:26:27,276 --> 00:26:29,257
by one of the level designers

471
00:26:29,257 --> 00:26:30,657
and then it was just integrated, I think,

472
00:26:30,657 --> 00:26:31,558
into the main quest.

473
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:34,639
Okay, so since I'm going kind of fast,

474
00:26:34,639 --> 00:26:36,580
I'll just literally stand here and explain stuff

475
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,800
because we have plenty of time.

476
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,421
Yeah.

477
00:26:39,421 --> 00:26:41,081
This is an Elder Scroll

478
00:26:41,081 --> 00:26:45,383
and I've been playing for probably like 10, 15 minutes.

479
00:26:45,383 --> 00:26:45,563
Mm-hmm.

480
00:26:47,825 --> 00:26:48,806
Hey, it's the game.

481
00:26:48,806 --> 00:26:52,589
But so all that horse stuff.

482
00:26:52,589 --> 00:26:56,873
So I, uh, a lot of properties transfer over through saves.

483
00:26:56,873 --> 00:27:01,837
Like if I am getting off a horse at really high speeds and I'm flying off of it and

484
00:27:01,837 --> 00:27:06,362
I make a save in the, and then I, while I'm in the air, I load a save, I'm going to

485
00:27:06,362 --> 00:27:09,064
fly really fast and that save I loaded.

486
00:27:09,994 --> 00:27:13,557
as long as they're both in third person because they have different like

487
00:27:13,557 --> 00:27:19,322
physics uh like collision properties um based on the perspective i think

488
00:27:19,322 --> 00:27:22,325
but um and it kind of resets every time you go between first and third person

489
00:27:22,325 --> 00:27:29,011
um wow that is mind-blowing yeah so and the reason i kept going back to

490
00:27:29,011 --> 00:27:32,634
that helgen cave like i went from esbern back to the helgen cave is because i

491
00:27:32,634 --> 00:27:35,336
made a save file

492
00:27:35,765 --> 00:27:37,867
on the outside of the cave right in the beginning of the game.

493
00:27:37,867 --> 00:27:42,530
That's the first thing I did was jump out of the place and make a save file outside of the cave.

494
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:48,053
And then after I rescued, for example, Esbern, I made a save,

495
00:27:48,053 --> 00:27:52,616
and then I loaded this save, and then I went through the cave here.

496
00:27:52,616 --> 00:27:57,379
And as the same time I went through the cave, I paused, and I went to the main menu,

497
00:27:57,379 --> 00:28:01,661
and then in the main menu, I loaded the save where I had Esbern rescued.

498
00:28:01,661 --> 00:28:03,222
And so when I enter the cave...

499
00:28:03,546 --> 00:28:07,828
It's got this character in there, the one from this save file.

500
00:28:07,828 --> 00:28:09,249
Uh, it's called the load warp.

501
00:28:09,249 --> 00:28:16,032
Um, I discovered that I discovered that on accident, um, like four or five years

502
00:28:16,032 --> 00:28:23,955
ago in oblivion and it also exists in fallout four, um, yeah, where I went

503
00:28:23,955 --> 00:28:27,237
through a door and oblivion the same time that a notification popped up.

504
00:28:27,237 --> 00:28:28,177
And so I had to.

505
00:28:28,504 --> 00:28:30,845
click yes on the notification and then I went through the door.

506
00:28:30,845 --> 00:28:33,886
But while the notification was up, I loaded a save file cause I was like,

507
00:28:33,886 --> 00:28:36,326
all right, enough practicing time to start a run.

508
00:28:36,326 --> 00:28:41,428
So I loaded the save file for my first run and then my character that should

509
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,868
search should have started the game when on the other side of that door.

510
00:28:43,868 --> 00:28:46,729
So I was like in handcuffs and stuff and yeah,

511
00:28:46,729 --> 00:28:52,531
that's so cool. That means like you, I mean like that's such a, such an accident.

512
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:56,752
So it's like a one in a million moment to that's now affected how you do all

513
00:28:56,752 --> 00:28:57,412
your runs.

514
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:06,282
Like I think that's why I was so excited to like make this happen was because like those accidents, you know, define speed running but

515
00:29:06,282 --> 00:29:09,664
The developers don't want those accidents. They want like the perfect

516
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:14,306
I mean skyrim is sort of the exception because they want k, you know, I jonah. I assume there was an air for chaos, but

517
00:29:14,306 --> 00:29:20,529
um, yeah, but there's still some like, you know, that's not how it's supposed to work. Um,

518
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:24,071
Uh, we're gonna pull some more questions from chat. So bubbles. Thank you

519
00:29:24,071 --> 00:29:26,952
That was watching jonah's expression. There was was

520
00:29:27,492 --> 00:29:30,012
Yeah, so that was the two main biggest things.

521
00:29:30,012 --> 00:29:31,993
I don't know why my neighbor was banging above me.

522
00:29:31,993 --> 00:29:33,173
I don't think he was sending a signal.

523
00:29:33,173 --> 00:29:33,993
I think he was like...

524
00:29:33,993 --> 00:29:35,033
Oh, that's a...

525
00:29:35,033 --> 00:29:38,334
Yeah, if your neighbor barges into your apartment, that's okay.

526
00:29:38,334 --> 00:29:39,395
You know, like, that's okay.

527
00:29:39,395 --> 00:29:40,995
The run can stop there.

528
00:29:40,995 --> 00:29:45,636
Okay, so we're going to pull some questions from chat while we restart the...

529
00:29:45,636 --> 00:29:47,597
while the run gets going again.

530
00:29:48,042 --> 00:29:53,349
Sean McPherson would like to know, Jonah, what is the best and easiest way to learn

531
00:29:53,349 --> 00:29:57,675
and get into normal, bump, height, etc. maps from your experience?

532
00:29:57,675 --> 00:30:00,999
So normal maps, bump maps, height maps.

533
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:04,364
Do you have an answer for that question?

534
00:30:06,684 --> 00:30:08,744
So I render a lot of those things.

535
00:30:08,744 --> 00:30:12,506
I mean, actually, to be honest, I render exclusively

536
00:30:12,506 --> 00:30:17,068
normal maps from high resolution files.

537
00:30:17,068 --> 00:30:19,009
So when I take something from ZBrush

538
00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:21,990
and it's three million polygons,

539
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:25,132
I can then transfer that using,

540
00:30:25,132 --> 00:30:28,053
recently I've been using Marmoset,

541
00:30:28,053 --> 00:30:29,794
but in the past I've used Crazy Bump

542
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:32,915
and other programs to generate normals.

543
00:30:34,297 --> 00:30:36,917
So we get a lot of that work done from projecting,

544
00:30:36,917 --> 00:30:38,997
projecting one model on top of another

545
00:30:38,997 --> 00:30:40,438
and rendering a normal map.

546
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:42,738
I don't often render height maps or bump maps these days.

547
00:30:42,738 --> 00:30:47,339
In fact, I haven't rendered a bump map

548
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:49,259
for almost the duration of my career.

549
00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:51,840
Only when I was learning CG

550
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,280
was I starting to use bump maps

551
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,161
because I didn't know what normal maps were.

552
00:30:56,161 --> 00:30:57,121
And for anyone who's just curious,

553
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,781
bump maps are grayscale images

554
00:30:58,781 --> 00:31:02,122
that wrap around an image, a model,

555
00:31:02,122 --> 00:31:03,542
and then when light hits that.

556
00:31:03,902 --> 00:31:09,166
model, they tell, they say, you know, what pops out, what pops in, or what appears to

557
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:13,729
pop out, what appears to pop in, so that when light hits an object, it can appear more three-dimensional

558
00:31:13,729 --> 00:31:14,650
than it is.

559
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:20,574
A normal map does the exact same thing, but it says what pops in, down, left, right, up,

560
00:31:20,574 --> 00:31:21,455
you know, whatever.

561
00:31:21,455 --> 00:31:24,157
So it's much more like a 3D access of things.

562
00:31:24,157 --> 00:31:27,139
So that just gives much richer results.

563
00:31:28,907 --> 00:31:33,631
So I will often work from ZBrush and then bring that high res model,

564
00:31:33,631 --> 00:31:37,975
project it using a projecting software. Um, like I said, previously,

565
00:31:37,975 --> 00:31:42,459
it was something like, um, uh, what I used to use.

566
00:31:42,459 --> 00:31:46,543
Um, I forget these days I use Marmoset.

567
00:31:46,543 --> 00:31:50,386
Marmoset render is a great program, super fun,

568
00:31:50,386 --> 00:31:53,128
and it's really good at baking textures. So.

569
00:31:53,744 --> 00:31:59,008
Yeah, and by the way, for anybody who has any further questions or I don't clarify things enough,

570
00:31:59,008 --> 00:32:02,551
feel free to hit me up on social media. Happy to answer what I can.

571
00:32:02,551 --> 00:32:08,055
Right on, yeah. Marie Stumba would like to know, how was the character creation modeling divided

572
00:32:08,055 --> 00:32:14,019
between team members at Bethesda? Did everyone have specialties or a region level they worked on?

573
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:17,982
Do you have a specialty? I guess that's actually like a good production question too, like how do

574
00:32:17,982 --> 00:32:21,845
you organize the billions of assets that make up Skyrim?

575
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:29,619
Yeah, so our art department was divided up into environment art, world art, and character art.

576
00:32:29,619 --> 00:32:35,904
And within those things, within world art, for instance, we have people who create effects like

577
00:32:35,904 --> 00:32:42,910
clouds, water, etc., mountains, skies, down to housing.

578
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:50,664
wall hangings, silverware, cups, that kind of thing.

579
00:32:50,664 --> 00:32:54,988
And then you have, on the character art side of things,

580
00:32:54,988 --> 00:32:57,009
you have people who make characters,

581
00:32:57,009 --> 00:33:00,572
all character related things, armor, weapons,

582
00:33:00,572 --> 00:33:02,013
that kind of thing.

583
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,254
And then there's animation as well.

584
00:33:03,254 --> 00:33:05,356
And I think, and I don't know if it's considered

585
00:33:05,356 --> 00:33:06,777
the same departments.

586
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:08,378
No, it's not considered the same department,

587
00:33:08,378 --> 00:33:10,240
but physically when I was there,

588
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,342
we had the concept artists in the character art space

589
00:33:13,342 --> 00:33:13,562
as well.

590
00:33:15,223 --> 00:33:22,612
Within that, within that, for my job, my job would be to take a piece of concept art

591
00:33:22,612 --> 00:33:28,699
that was kind of, had been a result of a back and forth between the art director, a lead designer,

592
00:33:28,699 --> 00:33:33,565
and the concept artist, and then I would take that piece of art and I would basically

593
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:37,152
make sure that I knew, you know,

594
00:33:37,152 --> 00:33:38,674
cause I like to riff on things.

595
00:33:38,674 --> 00:33:41,456
I don't like to just create exactly what's in the concept art

596
00:33:41,456 --> 00:33:43,377
because for me as an artist, I'm kind of like,

597
00:33:43,377 --> 00:33:44,058
well, where do I fit in?

598
00:33:44,058 --> 00:33:45,559
You know, I'm not just the,

599
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:47,361
I don't just transmute from 2D to 3D.

600
00:33:47,361 --> 00:33:50,723
I like to invent, but I will ask the art director

601
00:33:50,723 --> 00:33:52,645
or the lead designer or whoever, you know,

602
00:33:52,645 --> 00:33:55,047
what are the elements of this concept artist art

603
00:33:55,047 --> 00:33:56,448
that the artist has made?

604
00:33:56,448 --> 00:33:57,169
What's your favorite?

605
00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:58,550
You know, what do I,

606
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:01,212
basically making sure that I am not eradicating

607
00:34:01,212 --> 00:34:02,253
that which really like,

608
00:34:02,784 --> 00:34:09,447
inspires them. And then that also lets me know where I can feel free to tap dance.

609
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:16,850
So within that, within my job, I would then take that piece of two-dimensional concept art and I

610
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:23,253
would make it into a three-dimensional model that was fully textured. So I would make the model and

611
00:34:23,253 --> 00:34:28,075
the texture, and only when that was all polished out would I hand it off to the animator, and the

612
00:34:28,075 --> 00:34:29,556
animator would go to work on that.

613
00:34:30,177 --> 00:34:33,420
So I would say at least a place like Bethesda,

614
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:37,483
it's small enough that everyone has to wear multiple hats.

615
00:34:37,483 --> 00:34:40,385
And so for sure, I had to,

616
00:34:40,385 --> 00:34:44,809
you know, it's not it's not divided down to like, I do the model,

617
00:34:44,809 --> 00:34:46,470
you do the texture.

618
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:49,453
It's really like if you're if you're a character artist or a world artist

619
00:34:49,453 --> 00:34:52,195
or whatever, you are doing both

620
00:34:52,195 --> 00:34:55,778
except for the animation that you pass on.

621
00:34:55,778 --> 00:34:57,299
And that includes rigging.

622
00:34:58,306 --> 00:35:05,532
Before we move onward, I just want to process that that Jonah Jonah was giving us like such good deep cuts there that I

623
00:35:05,532 --> 00:35:12,037
barely had the brainpower to look at my monitor and realize that Jonah or bubbles had picked up a bucket and

624
00:35:12,037 --> 00:35:16,060
Used it to pass through an entire for somehow use it to pass through an entire castle

625
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:20,504
Finishing the sequence that we saw right before here

626
00:35:21,304 --> 00:35:26,989
So, my brain like just broke a specific fraction of a percent watching that.

627
00:35:26,989 --> 00:35:29,431
And I was just like sitting here listening to Jonah going,

628
00:35:29,431 --> 00:35:34,675
I am listening to this wonderful team dynamic get explained while there's a game

629
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:37,998
that I thought I understood just breaks in front of me all because of a bucket.

630
00:35:37,998 --> 00:35:39,519
And we got married.

631
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:40,360
Oh, we got married. Cool.

632
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,781
Hey, congratulations.

633
00:35:41,781 --> 00:35:43,903
That's amazing. Mazel tov.

634
00:35:43,903 --> 00:35:46,104
Well, we're not married yet.

635
00:35:46,104 --> 00:35:48,727
It's my follower and our marriage is happening soon.

636
00:35:49,235 --> 00:35:51,356
Well, I'm wishing you guys the very best.

637
00:35:51,356 --> 00:35:52,697
Thank you. I really appreciate that.

638
00:35:52,697 --> 00:35:54,798
Um, this is my dragon, by the way.

639
00:35:54,798 --> 00:35:58,380
I mean, this I mean, with the dragon, I enjoyed making parts of next.

640
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:01,222
Yeah. What what what what did you enjoy about like

641
00:36:01,222 --> 00:36:04,104
like what makes this so special to you as an artist?

642
00:36:05,266 --> 00:36:07,847
about this particular asset.

643
00:36:07,847 --> 00:36:11,009
You know, he's the one dragon except for Alduin who talks to

644
00:36:11,009 --> 00:36:12,449
you really talks to you.

645
00:36:12,449 --> 00:36:17,132
I mean, Odoving talks to you but not too in-depth and he basically

646
00:36:17,132 --> 00:36:19,213
uses the exact same model as the other dragons.

647
00:36:19,213 --> 00:36:23,515
I just gave him a reference colors from like a Kawasaki motorcycle

648
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:24,475
to make Odoving.

649
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:30,563
For Parthenax, he had a much more washed out bleached old thing going on, and he's a character.

650
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:37,147
And so I got to, I thought the concept art was great. You know, the way his scales look like a

651
00:36:37,147 --> 00:36:42,651
beard, but still look like just scales that grew out was a really brilliant way of aging a dragon.

652
00:36:42,651 --> 00:36:48,075
And I got to put a personality into his face. And I was actually surprised at how much

653
00:36:48,075 --> 00:36:52,978
the audience seemed to actually really like Parthenax. So yeah, I had a fun time making him.

654
00:36:53,452 --> 00:36:59,534
It's also interesting because Parthenax shows up really deep in the game to the point that I'm looking at the sequence and going,

655
00:36:59,534 --> 00:37:02,456
I think I maybe hit this on my first run, but I haven't seen him since.

656
00:37:02,456 --> 00:37:07,158
So the fact that it speaks to, you know, it speaks to your work that, you know,

657
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:11,380
players are able to connect with him, even though as Bubbles is so wonderfully demonstrating,

658
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:15,181
like Skyrim is this open book for people to throw themselves up against.

659
00:37:15,685 --> 00:37:19,208
Um, that's a mixed metaphor if there ever was one. So for chat,

660
00:37:19,208 --> 00:37:23,290
we are still taking your questions. We just wandered into

661
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:25,011
some specific topic areas for a second.

662
00:37:25,011 --> 00:37:29,114
I'm gonna do something pretty, if you don't mind pretty

663
00:37:29,114 --> 00:37:31,275
complicated. So I thought I would just spend like, like a

664
00:37:31,275 --> 00:37:33,957
second explaining what's gonna happen. It's gonna make it's

665
00:37:33,957 --> 00:37:37,879
gonna make no sense. So I got married because if you can't, if

666
00:37:37,879 --> 00:37:40,461
you if you cancel a marriage,

667
00:37:40,461 --> 00:37:43,162
canceling a marriage

668
00:37:44,268 --> 00:37:47,990
will initiate the signal to the character of like,

669
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:53,351
hey you can move now. And so if we're in the middle of that Elder Scroll

670
00:37:53,351 --> 00:37:57,352
cutscene with Parthenax watching the history repeat itself and stuff, you

671
00:37:57,352 --> 00:38:00,933
know, in that time travel moment, we can't move. It's a cutscene where we

672
00:38:00,933 --> 00:38:04,915
have to stay still. But if we can activate that cutscene and

673
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:08,076
then cancel a marriage like right after

674
00:38:08,076 --> 00:38:11,577
that, then we can move around during that cutscene.

675
00:38:12,467 --> 00:38:18,171
And so the way that we do that is enter this wedding room and

676
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:23,136
pull out the Elder Scroll at the same time.

677
00:38:23,136 --> 00:38:28,720
So you're destined to get married and you're destined to get divorced.

678
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,002
Yes. He gets really mad.

679
00:38:30,002 --> 00:38:34,405
If sometimes there's like sometimes there's routes with multiple marriages.

680
00:38:34,405 --> 00:38:37,848
And so you come back to him and he's like, how could you do this to me?

681
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:40,230
And then he's like, all right, I'll marry you again.

682
00:38:41,705 --> 00:38:43,566
This is an emotional rollercoaster.

683
00:38:43,566 --> 00:38:44,967
My goodness.

684
00:38:44,967 --> 00:38:46,087
So now we're in the cutscene.

685
00:38:46,087 --> 00:38:49,530
We're bouncing back and forth between breaking a marriage

686
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:53,192
and using that marriage to fling yourself, you know,

687
00:38:53,192 --> 00:38:55,513
through time and space,

688
00:38:55,513 --> 00:38:58,595
which isn't how that's supposed to work.

689
00:38:58,595 --> 00:39:02,198
Thank you for that explanation, Bubbles.

690
00:39:02,198 --> 00:39:05,039
You, once again, just every five seconds,

691
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:07,781
I just have an existential crisis, thanks to...

692
00:39:07,781 --> 00:39:09,402
Uh... I go here.

693
00:39:09,402 --> 00:39:09,983
I am going to...

694
00:39:09,983 --> 00:39:11,263
That's a lot of stuff I gotta do.

695
00:39:11,998 --> 00:39:15,100
Right on. I'm going to go ahead and grab questions from chat.

696
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,782
Um, uh, Danny Cizek, uh, that could be Cizek.

697
00:39:18,782 --> 00:39:20,103
I am not 100% sure on the pronunciation.

698
00:39:20,103 --> 00:39:24,986
Uh, I would like to say for texturing, we'd like to ask Jonah for texturing

699
00:39:24,986 --> 00:39:29,268
material design, was there a concern about targeting a certain realism standard?

700
00:39:29,268 --> 00:39:32,170
If so, how did that measure to get, get measured across the studio artists?

701
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:36,052
Which I think is an interesting question because even though Skyrim

702
00:39:36,052 --> 00:39:40,575
doesn't have a realistic look, it certainly has like the 3d models of it.

703
00:39:40,575 --> 00:39:40,755
Have a

704
00:39:40,955 --> 00:39:44,619
Specific to oh did something surprising surprise you yeah

705
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:49,424
I should have put my swords away before interacting with that carriage or my game crashes

706
00:39:49,424 --> 00:39:52,347
I know it doesn't make any sense, but yeah, no no no makes total

707
00:39:52,347 --> 00:39:56,472
It makes as much sense as everything else this run. This is why we make quicksand

708
00:39:57,266 --> 00:40:01,370
Jonah, do you want to answer that realism question?

709
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:06,296
Yeah, can you ask that question real quick, the short version of that question?

710
00:40:06,296 --> 00:40:12,763
Sure thing. For texturing and material design, was there a concern about targeting a certain realism standard?

711
00:40:12,763 --> 00:40:16,407
If so, how did that standard get measured across the studio artists?

712
00:40:16,407 --> 00:40:18,169
And that comes from Danny Chizik.

713
00:40:18,718 --> 00:40:20,219
I see, I see.

714
00:40:20,219 --> 00:40:23,822
Danny, you know, there wasn't the harshest metric when it came to that.

715
00:40:23,822 --> 00:40:24,602
I think

716
00:40:24,602 --> 00:40:29,266
Bethesda games already have a particular style, which definitely

717
00:40:29,266 --> 00:40:32,648
is meant to sell realism.

718
00:40:33,379 --> 00:40:38,883
I don't think, I know for, you know, I can speak for myself, attaining, making something

719
00:40:38,883 --> 00:40:43,247
feel real was very, very high on my list of things.

720
00:40:43,247 --> 00:40:47,069
And that doesn't just mean, like, getting all the textures just right, but it really

721
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:50,372
comes down to making characters and creatures that have...

722
00:40:51,012 --> 00:40:53,233
a sense of weight that have a sense of age, you know,

723
00:40:53,233 --> 00:40:56,695
where the skin wrinkles and folds in a certain way,

724
00:40:56,695 --> 00:40:59,436
you know, to really make it feel lived in,

725
00:40:59,436 --> 00:41:03,597
as if this thing existed before we, the players, even encountered them.

726
00:41:03,597 --> 00:41:06,479
So that was my own personal attempt.

727
00:41:06,479 --> 00:41:07,899
Oh, I made Alduin on that wall as well.

728
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:10,800
If anybody owns a collector's edition of Skyrim,

729
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:16,583
and they have that sculpture, then awesome.

730
00:41:18,481 --> 00:41:21,683
But I, so there wasn't a particular metric that,

731
00:41:21,683 --> 00:41:24,665
you know, the art director typically oversees that

732
00:41:24,665 --> 00:41:28,027
and makes sure that everybody is kind of on board

733
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,309
and attaining a certain aesthetic.

734
00:41:30,309 --> 00:41:34,491
But thankfully, you know, when you're inventing fantasy,

735
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:38,514
there's not a ton of one-to-one, you know,

736
00:41:38,514 --> 00:41:41,656
contrast between like, oh, well,

737
00:41:41,656 --> 00:41:42,837
you definitely got the dragon wrong

738
00:41:42,837 --> 00:41:44,758
because we all know what dragons look like.

739
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:51,892
So it's much more about making it feel real, making it feel believable, but also kind of

740
00:41:51,892 --> 00:41:57,595
going off script a bit. I'm definitely a fan for going off script for inventing and I think I'm

741
00:41:57,595 --> 00:42:01,296
relatively known for making something that can sell as real but have

742
00:42:01,767 --> 00:42:05,509
not quite a realistic feel, more like painterly feel

743
00:42:05,509 --> 00:42:07,650
or expressive feel, but yeah, there wasn't,

744
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,051
there was not, in answer to your question,

745
00:42:09,051 --> 00:42:13,334
there wasn't like a very strong across the board way

746
00:42:13,334 --> 00:42:14,114
to measure that.

747
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:16,515
I think it's just the job of the art director

748
00:42:16,515 --> 00:42:18,356
to make sure that things feel unified enough

749
00:42:18,356 --> 00:42:20,298
that everyone, all the different artists

750
00:42:20,298 --> 00:42:22,899
who are working on the team are creating something

751
00:42:22,899 --> 00:42:26,481
that looks, I'm so confused,

752
00:42:26,481 --> 00:42:29,083
all these dead dragons everywhere.

753
00:42:30,852 --> 00:42:34,912
So yeah, the things basically hold together enough, you know, so

754
00:42:34,912 --> 00:42:37,593
Bubbles, why are there so many dead dragons?

755
00:42:37,593 --> 00:42:40,513
It's the great dragon war

756
00:42:40,513 --> 00:42:46,175
Yes, it's the flashback with the Elder Scrolls. That's right again. I

757
00:42:46,175 --> 00:42:53,736
Have played a hundred plus hours of Elder Scrolls never saw that. Sorry Jonah. That's okay. I have seen I have gotten that far

758
00:42:53,736 --> 00:43:00,257
Because it's main quest nobody plays this. No, I said, I know I know it's a strategy

759
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,001
You gotta find those jewels.

760
00:43:03,001 --> 00:43:04,102
I mean, that's my favorite thing.

761
00:43:04,102 --> 00:43:06,263
That's my favorite thing about Bethesda games in general.

762
00:43:06,263 --> 00:43:08,545
That's part of the reason I joined

763
00:43:08,545 --> 00:43:11,667
the team and, you know, or wanted to, you know, set out to,

764
00:43:11,667 --> 00:43:14,569
is because I just loved the fact that you can just go anywhere.

765
00:43:14,569 --> 00:43:16,410
This is a very common idea these days.

766
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:20,412
But when I first got the game, Morrowind, when I was in college,

767
00:43:20,412 --> 00:43:24,615
you know, I literally was Googling, you know, I really I really want to play

768
00:43:24,615 --> 00:43:28,057
a good RPG, you know, Final Fantasy is not available on PC.

769
00:43:28,867 --> 00:43:30,928
and I'm not even sure if I want to play Final Fantasy,

770
00:43:30,928 --> 00:43:33,449
but you know, what are the good RPGs out there?

771
00:43:33,449 --> 00:43:36,550
And I Googled top 10 RPGs.

772
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:38,691
And they had this game called Marwen,

773
00:43:38,691 --> 00:43:41,513
which looked totally weird, totally alien.

774
00:43:42,382 --> 00:43:46,343
And I like Weird and Alien. I like seeing things that I've never seen before.

775
00:43:46,343 --> 00:43:52,625
I don't like too much classic fantasy because it's, you know...

776
00:43:52,625 --> 00:43:58,686
For me, the whole purpose of fantasy is to see something and experience something that I've never experienced before.

777
00:43:58,686 --> 00:44:03,107
And if fantasy is just dragons... Sorry, dwarves and elves...

778
00:44:03,996 --> 00:44:06,517
I get kind of frustrated.

779
00:44:06,517 --> 00:44:08,158
The Barwon really, really got me hooked.

780
00:44:08,158 --> 00:44:11,180
And then what I didn't understand, which I only saw recently...

781
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:14,402
We just... your power of Alduin got sent to the sky.

782
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:15,282
Don't worry, guys.

783
00:44:15,282 --> 00:44:21,466
So, this is a bug that can happen if you Lotus Save during the Alduin fight, when he's flying around.

784
00:44:21,466 --> 00:44:23,827
This is the current patch, by the way, so...

785
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:24,087
But...

786
00:44:24,087 --> 00:44:28,630
I know that's not your department, Jonah.

787
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:35,877
But if you load a save during the Alduin fight, he can just perch and never come down or be active again.

788
00:44:35,877 --> 00:44:38,058
And so it can end the run completely.

789
00:44:38,058 --> 00:44:40,599
But I have a backup for when that happens.

790
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:42,300
Specifically for when that happens.

791
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:46,142
So what happens normally is he lands and you just kill him pretty quickly.

792
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:48,924
You just hit him in the wing and then he talks for a second.

793
00:44:48,924 --> 00:44:53,306
And so this is the backup save.

794
00:44:53,306 --> 00:44:53,787
Look, this is...

795
00:44:53,787 --> 00:44:56,708
Typically he would land like he did before and I would get him.

796
00:44:56,708 --> 00:44:59,510
I would stunlock him on the wing over and over again.

797
00:44:59,946 --> 00:45:06,308
If you look at my stamina, I can do this repetitive attack with both swords by initiating with

798
00:45:06,308 --> 00:45:11,170
both clicks of the mouse and then just tapping so I don't consume the stamina.

799
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:17,173
Wait, yeah, it worked on the first one.

800
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:18,093
So yeah.

801
00:45:18,093 --> 00:45:22,355
So I'm never consuming stamina.

802
00:45:22,355 --> 00:45:25,036
Yeah, it's only going up.

803
00:45:27,875 --> 00:45:34,958
Yeah, so that's the power attack combo infinite thing that you do.

804
00:45:34,958 --> 00:45:37,819
It's because we used to play as the, uh...

805
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:43,301
I'll load this save just so I'm not out of sync with my timetables.

806
00:45:43,301 --> 00:45:47,402
But, I'll, uh...

807
00:45:47,402 --> 00:45:48,963
I'll use that

808
00:45:48,963 --> 00:45:52,224
to fight pretty much everything in the run. But the only things I fight

809
00:45:52,224 --> 00:45:52,424
are, uh...

810
00:45:57,028 --> 00:45:58,388
Alduin and then Alduin again.

811
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:01,470
Jonah, sorry to where we sort of rolled

812
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:03,311
out here through the road.

813
00:46:03,311 --> 00:46:04,251
It's OK. It's OK.

814
00:46:04,251 --> 00:46:04,991
I broke my mind.

815
00:46:04,991 --> 00:46:06,912
We're going to. Yeah.

816
00:46:06,912 --> 00:46:09,774
I mean, we were just watching our

817
00:46:09,774 --> 00:46:13,755
again, constant existential crises.

818
00:46:13,755 --> 00:46:15,776
Yeah. I don't want to like,

819
00:46:15,776 --> 00:46:18,017
I don't want to like, you know,

820
00:46:18,017 --> 00:46:18,918
go to the end of the run

821
00:46:18,918 --> 00:46:20,459
to explain everything that happened.

822
00:46:20,459 --> 00:46:21,299
Yeah, no, this is good.

823
00:46:21,299 --> 00:46:22,539
No, just jump in whenever,

824
00:46:22,539 --> 00:46:24,780
because usually what I'm trying to,

825
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:25,781
you know, maintain a narrative and.

826
00:46:26,404 --> 00:46:30,949
answer your questions. I'm usually part of my brain is just watching kind of like quietly exploding.

827
00:46:30,949 --> 00:46:32,071
Oh totally, yeah.

828
00:46:32,071 --> 00:46:36,676
So it's all good. All I was going to say was that when I first discovered Morrowind and

829
00:46:36,676 --> 00:46:45,326
Bethesda Softworks in general, open world games were totally new. And so I really early on got into

830
00:46:45,326 --> 00:46:46,047
not...

831
00:46:46,407 --> 00:46:50,449
finishing the main quest. I was just like, the whole point of this is for me to discover

832
00:46:50,449 --> 00:46:56,472
adventures. And I really felt like, I thought the team did a great job with Skyrim with that. I mean,

833
00:46:56,472 --> 00:47:02,535
really, really, there's so much magic to explore and to see. And then I actually thought that

834
00:47:02,535 --> 00:47:05,477
Fallout 4 was awesome at that. You know, I just, I jumped into Fallout 4 and I was just,

835
00:47:05,477 --> 00:47:09,599
was immediately just loving all the side quests, et cetera. I don't know. Yeah.

836
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:15,997
Um, going from chat real quick, Bubbles, you have a fan here, uh, Eric, uh,

837
00:47:15,997 --> 00:47:19,722
Billary, Billary, there's a J in there and I really don't know how it goes. I'm sorry, Eric.

838
00:47:19,722 --> 00:47:24,868
Um, uh, they love to see Bubbles speed running and they love these questions in discussion too,

839
00:47:24,868 --> 00:47:29,033
so we all get a shout out there, but you know, Bubbles, I wanted to give, uh, give your fans some time.

840
00:47:30,235 --> 00:47:33,016
Um, uh, Jonah, you did not work on the VR edition, right?

841
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,637
You were gone from Bethesda by then?

842
00:47:35,637 --> 00:47:35,817
Yeah.

843
00:47:35,817 --> 00:47:36,117
Okay.

844
00:47:36,117 --> 00:47:39,658
So Steve, can you, thank you for asking about the VR version.

845
00:47:39,658 --> 00:47:42,759
Um, sadly, however, we cannot answer that question.

846
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:43,939
Um, Danny Chizik is here again.

847
00:47:43,939 --> 00:47:47,680
Did you and the team ever encountered differences of opinion about the best

848
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,402
way to present a character or scene and how did you resolve them?

849
00:47:52,859 --> 00:47:55,101
That's a good question.

850
00:47:55,101 --> 00:47:56,261
Certainly.

851
00:47:56,261 --> 00:48:00,064
I think that those kinds of things happen all the time.

852
00:48:00,064 --> 00:48:07,028
I wasn't always, I was not usually a part of this discussion on how scenes would unfold.

853
00:48:07,028 --> 00:48:09,530
Of course, playing the game I had some of my own feedback.

854
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:11,611
And sometimes I was listened to and sometimes I wasn't.

855
00:48:11,611 --> 00:48:14,753
And sometimes that was a question of, they had a differing opinion.

856
00:48:14,753 --> 00:48:16,475
Sometimes it was a question of just bandwidth.

857
00:48:16,475 --> 00:48:20,477
We just didn't have, we recognized that there was an issue and we just didn't have time to fix it.

858
00:48:22,737 --> 00:48:28,786
I'm trying to think of a particular difference of opinion that may have resulted in some

859
00:48:28,786 --> 00:48:31,971
kind of conflict, but I can't think of one that occurred per se.

860
00:48:31,971 --> 00:48:34,714
There's definitely like course corrections that happen.

861
00:48:34,714 --> 00:48:35,996
So for instance...

862
00:48:37,138 --> 00:48:42,485
you know, I, you know, when the concept art for the Spriggan looked a lot like a dry ad,

863
00:48:42,485 --> 00:48:48,673
you know, she was just a woman kind of made of wood with glowing green light. And I just thought

864
00:48:48,673 --> 00:48:55,021
that that's that was too standard fantasy. And I added, like kind of

865
00:48:56,224 --> 00:49:02,089
an extra joint in the legs, gave her kind of stag legs, gave her huge horns, and then I

866
00:49:02,089 --> 00:49:09,776
collaborated with the effects artist to create this like beehive look and feel. And

867
00:49:09,776 --> 00:49:12,338
other things like that, you know, where you're kind of going off script.

868
00:49:13,184 --> 00:49:15,306
And whenever I did that, I would make sure that that was okay.

869
00:49:15,306 --> 00:49:19,370
You know, you don't want to just piss everybody off by just inventing.

870
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:23,014
And so I always, you know, and, and, and, and it takes time to make an art asset.

871
00:49:23,014 --> 00:49:26,777
So as you're developing an art asset, you're often checking in with your, your

872
00:49:26,777 --> 00:49:30,301
lead, um, to make sure that what you're doing, yeah, go through all those.

873
00:49:30,871 --> 00:49:31,211
I love that.

874
00:49:31,211 --> 00:49:37,016
It's one of the best things about the game, is just running across those huge tables.

875
00:49:37,016 --> 00:49:42,120
The funniest thing ever is I've had record-paced runs die to running across that, and then

876
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:45,764
I would kick a plate in the air, and I would accidentally try to talk to Ulfric Stormcloak

877
00:49:45,764 --> 00:49:49,647
the same time that I would press E, as the plate would be in front of my vision.

878
00:49:49,647 --> 00:49:51,468
So I would accidentally steal something.

879
00:49:51,997 --> 00:49:52,177
Oh no!

880
00:49:52,177 --> 00:49:55,198
And it's such an ordinary bug, like that's what happens in Skyrim,

881
00:49:55,198 --> 00:50:02,203
is you try to talk to someone, you steal something, and your normal play is interrupted.

882
00:50:02,203 --> 00:50:03,884
Which is beautiful and chaotic.

883
00:50:03,884 --> 00:50:07,906
It is so, like, yeah, exactly what you saw there, but I kick a plate,

884
00:50:07,906 --> 00:50:11,868
and it intercepts my interaction press with the Ulfric, and the...

885
00:50:11,868 --> 00:50:16,071
And then these guards all pull out their weapons because I stole a sword.

886
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:22,315
Excuse me, sir. I meant to say hello, but instead I took this plate and put it in my bag

887
00:50:22,557 --> 00:50:24,578
They take food stealing seriously.

888
00:50:24,578 --> 00:50:25,558
They really do.

889
00:50:25,558 --> 00:50:26,378
They do.

890
00:50:26,378 --> 00:50:29,179
Probably what we should have done is make it so that like when you try to

891
00:50:29,179 --> 00:50:32,219
when you click on something and it's stealable, you should have to like

892
00:50:32,219 --> 00:50:35,140
hold down the button an extra second to make it happen or something.

893
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:37,940
I feel like button holding came a couple of years after this

894
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,541
because I remember in 2011, you know, the other games of the era

895
00:50:40,541 --> 00:50:43,642
because Assassin's Creed kicked up around that.

896
00:50:43,642 --> 00:50:47,022
Assassin's Creed two kicked up like a couple of years before by 2011.

897
00:50:47,022 --> 00:50:49,323
I think we were heading into, you know, revelations from that.

898
00:50:49,323 --> 00:50:51,643
But we keep giving shout outs to Assassin's Creed today.

899
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,482
But you know, Halo Reach was out around this time.

900
00:50:55,482 --> 00:50:57,863
And I distinctly remember like a couple of years later,

901
00:50:57,863 --> 00:51:01,105
it was a few years before like hold down button to confirm an action

902
00:51:01,105 --> 00:51:04,066
or an interaction was popularized in game development.

903
00:51:04,066 --> 00:51:06,088
And then and then it was everywhere.

904
00:51:06,088 --> 00:51:09,529
And now it's like, you know, I'm playing Ghost of Tsushima right now.

905
00:51:09,529 --> 00:51:11,691
And it's such a common interaction that game.

906
00:51:11,691 --> 00:51:13,992
You want to talk about a game that has good art.

907
00:51:13,992 --> 00:51:14,652
That game is beautiful.

908
00:51:14,652 --> 00:51:15,633
It looks unbelievable.

909
00:51:15,633 --> 00:51:16,954
Yeah, unbelievable.

910
00:51:16,954 --> 00:51:19,335
And so much of that is like lighting and environment.

911
00:51:19,335 --> 00:51:21,216
And it's stunning. It looks stunning.

912
00:51:21,859 --> 00:51:24,321
We're gonna grab a question from Michael Gibbs here unless bubbles

913
00:51:24,321 --> 00:51:28,524
Is there anything else you want to break our minds with before I grab it?

914
00:51:28,524 --> 00:51:34,068
Well, this is the peace council and if you notice all this stuttering and flashing that I've been doing this game that's happening right here, too

915
00:51:34,068 --> 00:51:38,651
That's quick save quick loading and that's been around since probably fallout 3

916
00:51:38,651 --> 00:51:47,778
It was first noticed that fallout 3 was broken when some Japanese player with fallout 3 was noticing that like

917
00:51:47,778 --> 00:51:50,120
Every time he loaded a save file

918
00:51:51,127 --> 00:51:55,328
nothing was loaded in for a second except for the character. So you could go through a wall real

919
00:51:55,328 --> 00:51:59,870
quick if you loaded it next to a wall. And then somebody, an American runner named Craftlab,

920
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:03,772
integrated that over with quick saves and quick loads because it was available on the PC.

921
00:52:03,772 --> 00:52:06,933
And ever since then it's been pretty broken with every Bethesda game because they kind of

922
00:52:06,933 --> 00:52:14,436
recycle everything. And that's why load warping also works on like several of the games. But

923
00:52:14,436 --> 00:52:17,898
Peace Council is going to be pretty boring. I'm just skipping the dialogue.

924
00:52:18,312 --> 00:52:22,260
I appreciate the quick load anecdote.

925
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:25,345
Jonah, for your part, here is a question from Michael Gibbs.

926
00:52:25,345 --> 00:52:28,652
Did you have any part in the Skyrim character creator?

927
00:52:28,652 --> 00:52:29,353
Yes or no?

928
00:52:29,353 --> 00:52:30,174
Quick yes or no.

929
00:52:30,988 --> 00:52:31,169
No.

930
00:52:31,169 --> 00:52:31,209
No.

931
00:52:31,209 --> 00:52:31,709
OK.

932
00:52:31,709 --> 00:52:34,030
We're going to skip the rest of the question then.

933
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:34,711
Sorry, Michael.

934
00:52:34,711 --> 00:52:36,812
But thank you so much for watching.

935
00:52:36,812 --> 00:52:37,512
Yeah.

936
00:52:37,512 --> 00:52:40,574
But I will say this, that when Skyrim started out,

937
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,775
the character creator, the characters

938
00:52:42,775 --> 00:52:43,976
were pretty gnarly looking.

939
00:52:43,976 --> 00:52:47,017
And my friend Dennis put a lot of time and effort

940
00:52:47,017 --> 00:52:48,218
into that character creator.

941
00:52:48,218 --> 00:52:51,199
And so many of the sliders and the abilities

942
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:55,362
to change face paint, face size, et cetera, was due to him.

943
00:52:55,362 --> 00:52:57,723
He worked his butt off, for sure.

944
00:52:57,723 --> 00:52:59,364
Dennis Mejiones is his name.

945
00:52:59,364 --> 00:53:00,805
He worked very hard on that.

946
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:04,200
Big shout out to Dennis, do you know if he's still at Bethesda?

947
00:53:04,405 --> 00:53:05,926
He is. Yes, he is. He is.

948
00:53:05,926 --> 00:53:09,647
So if you didn't let the character creation system, it was not his fault.

949
00:53:09,647 --> 00:53:11,508
It was due to the technical limitations.

950
00:53:11,508 --> 00:53:14,268
If you do like it, it is that is that is due to him.

951
00:53:14,268 --> 00:53:17,430
I mean, other people did, you know, other things like, you know, this guy,

952
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:19,590
Charles made it's like awesome, like hair in the game.

953
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:23,431
That's like is is just looks so much better than what we had before.

954
00:53:23,431 --> 00:53:24,572
But then it's just put a lot of effort.

955
00:53:24,572 --> 00:53:27,893
I think he was just profoundly unsatisfied with what we had and just

956
00:53:27,893 --> 00:53:30,374
dedicated all kinds of extra hours to making the system work.

957
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:31,434
And so, yeah.

958
00:53:32,789 --> 00:53:33,209
Right on.

959
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:35,770
Uh, just another reminder for folks in chat.

960
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:37,330
We are still taking your questions.

961
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:41,251
We've got some time left in, left in the run here.

962
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:42,212
Um, uh, bubbles.

963
00:53:42,212 --> 00:53:44,692
Would you refresh my memory on how much time left we're expecting?

964
00:53:44,692 --> 00:53:50,754
Um, I would expect somewhere between 20 and 25 minutes tops.

965
00:53:50,754 --> 00:53:55,956
We that's such a, that's like the right amount of time to get some more questions.

966
00:53:55,956 --> 00:53:56,716
And so we will.

967
00:53:57,257 --> 00:54:04,319
We will take them. Jonah, we can get a little serious here while we wait for the Peace Council to wrap up talks.

968
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:11,421
You mentioned before about how you wound up with tendonitis as an injury from working.

969
00:54:11,421 --> 00:54:16,402
People don't think about game development as a business with injuries, but the human body.

970
00:54:17,063 --> 00:54:22,970
is poorly constructed and fails us in specific ways. That's why I'm sitting in a chair that

971
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:27,475
looks like a race car chair because my back was having issues working from my old chair.

972
00:54:30,491 --> 00:54:34,212
How as an art, I think we've actually had a couple of GDC talks about managing, you know,

973
00:54:34,212 --> 00:54:40,134
art is such an intensive process. Like it's so focused, you're constantly doing small hand

974
00:54:40,134 --> 00:54:43,996
movements with things that were meant to club, you know, at best, maybe bow and arrow. But how

975
00:54:43,996 --> 00:54:50,218
have you as an artist have like managed your physical health alongside your, your creative

976
00:54:50,218 --> 00:54:51,538
health there, you know, like?

977
00:54:52,678 --> 00:54:58,164
That's a good question. I think that it definitely extends to artists and programmers alike and

978
00:54:58,164 --> 00:55:06,071
anyone who's sitting at a computer all day. Yeah, so I had sustained this injury working on Alduin.

979
00:55:06,071 --> 00:55:11,656
He was behind schedule. I was referencing a meteorite in creating him, his surface texture,

980
00:55:11,656 --> 00:55:14,979
so every inch of his body was pitted and whatever. And so then I had to...

981
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:17,852
create the low polygon version of all that.

982
00:55:17,852 --> 00:55:18,793
And it was just very strenuous.

983
00:55:18,793 --> 00:55:21,094
A lot of clicking, clicking, holding, clicking, dragging,

984
00:55:21,094 --> 00:55:23,476
clicking with one finger, clicking with two fingers.

985
00:55:23,476 --> 00:55:25,397
And I ended up falling behind and falling behind

986
00:55:25,397 --> 00:55:28,679
and then just really hurt myself.

987
00:55:28,679 --> 00:55:31,801
And actually, within a day of finishing Alduin,

988
00:55:31,801 --> 00:55:33,222
I just had to stop.

989
00:55:33,222 --> 00:55:35,564
And I was out of the office for three weeks, et cetera.

990
00:55:38,517 --> 00:55:46,561
You know, we forget that that we humans, and especially we gamers, are animals.

991
00:55:46,561 --> 00:55:49,062
We're not just, you know, brains with fingers that can move.

992
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:54,061
were animals. You know, when you look at your dog and they don't go for a walk that day,

993
00:55:54,061 --> 00:55:59,302
they are profoundly depressed and very upset. And I think that we as artists need to remember

994
00:55:59,302 --> 00:56:05,263
that we have bodies that need to be tended to. And so, you know, I got that injury right

995
00:56:05,263 --> 00:56:10,084
around when I was 27 or so, which is about the age that a lot of mortal people realize

996
00:56:10,084 --> 00:56:15,305
that they are mortal. You know, for the first time in their youth.

997
00:56:17,287 --> 00:56:20,548
their body is suddenly failing them.

998
00:56:20,548 --> 00:56:22,609
I had discovered from an art perspective

999
00:56:22,609 --> 00:56:25,030
that a couple different things helped.

1000
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:30,071
I did a lot of PT, and the PT helped to a fair degree.

1001
00:56:30,071 --> 00:56:32,232
A lot of stretching, a lot of icing of the wrist.

1002
00:56:32,232 --> 00:56:34,553
I think people forget that icing

1003
00:56:34,553 --> 00:56:36,314
is not just for pain management,

1004
00:56:36,314 --> 00:56:39,235
it actually accelerates the process of healing.

1005
00:56:39,235 --> 00:56:41,056
And so that was one other thing I did.

1006
00:56:41,056 --> 00:56:42,536
And I really took to stretching.

1007
00:56:44,316 --> 00:56:46,157
doing a lot of stretching and that helped out a lot.

1008
00:56:46,157 --> 00:56:51,902
Ultimately, what I did discover is that the problem wasn't in my wrist, which I thought

1009
00:56:51,902 --> 00:56:54,684
it was, even though the result was tendonitis.

1010
00:56:54,684 --> 00:56:57,566
The problem was in my spine.

1011
00:56:57,566 --> 00:57:02,189
I had a whiplash injury from back in the day that apparently between these two vertebrae,

1012
00:57:02,189 --> 00:57:06,192
the nerves that come out from between the vertebrae, because between each vertebrae,

1013
00:57:06,192 --> 00:57:10,395
we have nerves that shoot out into our bodies that control our limbs, that control our organs,

1014
00:57:10,395 --> 00:57:10,535
etc.

1015
00:57:10,535 --> 00:57:13,457
And it was those two vertebrae that I had this

1016
00:57:13,657 --> 00:57:19,341
compression in with the nerves that go to the tips of the fingers. So I think it was

1017
00:57:19,341 --> 00:57:22,804
partially due to overwork on my part.

1018
00:57:23,318 --> 00:57:28,742
and partially due to just poor posture and mismanagement

1019
00:57:28,742 --> 00:57:31,103
and sitting too long without taking breaks

1020
00:57:31,103 --> 00:57:33,345
and not moving myself and getting my whole body stretching.

1021
00:57:33,345 --> 00:57:35,066
These days I put a lot more effort

1022
00:57:35,066 --> 00:57:38,348
into getting out of the house, going for a walk.

1023
00:57:38,348 --> 00:57:39,909
These are the things that loosen up, not just,

1024
00:57:39,909 --> 00:57:42,510
they don't really loosen up your wrists per se

1025
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:45,192
or your fingers, but they will loosen up the bigger,

1026
00:57:45,192 --> 00:57:48,134
more central and more integral parts of the body.

1027
00:57:48,134 --> 00:57:48,194
So.

1028
00:57:48,774 --> 00:57:57,528
To people who are looking to reduce their own physical strain, often that starts farther

1029
00:57:57,528 --> 00:57:59,672
up the body than you think it does.

1030
00:58:00,777 --> 00:58:07,821
So really focusing on your back, really focusing on your neck, making sure that you're, you know,

1031
00:58:07,821 --> 00:58:13,945
that you're getting some very basic flexibility up there will do a lot of help. So when I'm

1032
00:58:13,945 --> 00:58:20,609
experiencing wrist pain, often I stretch my chest, you know, against the wall or open it up,

1033
00:58:20,609 --> 00:58:23,751
and that reduces the pain further down the extremities.

1034
00:58:25,072 --> 00:58:31,875
Take care of yourself, watch out for your physical well-being, really respect the fact that you,

1035
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:35,936
you know, whether or not you care to admit it, you're an animal and you need to treat yourself

1036
00:58:35,936 --> 00:58:40,938
as if you were your own pet. And take those fundamental care of these basic aspects of

1037
00:58:40,938 --> 00:58:48,720
yourself. That is generally good advice. Bubbles, we've gone from the Peace Council to a dragon.

1038
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:52,441
What exactly are you doing to speed this particular part up? We're going to capture

1039
00:58:52,441 --> 00:58:54,822
Oda being so we can go to Skuldaufen.

1040
00:58:55,941 --> 00:58:57,102
and find Alduin.

1041
00:58:57,102 --> 00:59:05,706
And so there is a trick where you can shout while you're opening the door, and then you

1042
00:59:05,706 --> 00:59:09,828
get him in the first available second that you enter the stream, but I couldn't line

1043
00:59:09,828 --> 00:59:11,349
it up, but it's okay.

1044
00:59:11,349 --> 00:59:13,390
So I just got him the casual way.

1045
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:19,293
JGYou still got him trapped while doing these insane feats.

1046
00:59:19,293 --> 00:59:21,935
Let's see here.

1047
00:59:22,912 --> 00:59:25,033
Uh, we have some more questions in chat.

1048
00:59:25,033 --> 00:59:27,635
Uh, Danny, we will get your question, but because you know,

1049
00:59:27,635 --> 00:59:29,657
we've gotten a lot of yours, we're going to grab Gabe, uh,

1050
00:59:29,657 --> 00:59:30,878
Pofkers, Pofkers.

1051
00:59:30,878 --> 00:59:33,420
Uh, do you have any favorite stretches?

1052
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:35,802
Would you be willing to demonstrate a couple?

1053
00:59:35,802 --> 00:59:36,042
Uh, wow.

1054
00:59:36,042 --> 00:59:39,065
That's I hadn't thought of being able to do that on the stream, but yeah, if you

1055
00:59:39,065 --> 00:59:42,348
have any stretches that like help we, uh, you know what actually gave, we're

1056
00:59:42,348 --> 00:59:43,849
going to pause on that.

1057
00:59:43,849 --> 00:59:49,013
Um, we do have a GDC talk on the GDC vault that should be free to access.

1058
00:59:49,013 --> 00:59:49,994
That is about.

1059
00:59:49,994 --> 00:59:50,194
Um.

1060
00:59:50,975 --> 00:59:54,456
name it is about stretches that you can do.

1061
00:59:54,456 --> 00:59:57,137
So I'm going to go look that up while we get another question in for Jonah,

1062
00:59:57,137 --> 00:59:58,738
and then I'll put that in chat.

1063
00:59:58,738 --> 01:00:00,819
So we're going to let that be the guide for it,

1064
01:00:00,819 --> 01:00:02,159
because we have a whole talk about it.

1065
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:04,000
And Jonah doesn't have time to

1066
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,881
ethically get you through some helpful stretches in five minutes

1067
01:00:06,881 --> 01:00:10,223
because the five minute education on that is probably not enough.

1068
01:00:10,223 --> 01:00:11,363
So we're going to get to Danny.

1069
01:00:11,363 --> 01:00:12,504
Your question does come up

1070
01:00:12,504 --> 01:00:17,026
between concept modeling, rigging and animating.

1071
01:00:17,026 --> 01:00:19,927
How long was the average pipeline for characters in terms of days,

1072
01:00:19,927 --> 01:00:20,567
weeks or months?

1073
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,782
Um, you know, it depends on the assets.

1074
01:00:24,782 --> 01:00:29,425
So something like the dragons, um, I was given, I believe, 32 different

1075
01:00:29,425 --> 01:00:35,150
illustrations of dragons, uh, to make, to, to, to reference, uh, before I made,

1076
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:36,331
um, the dragon.

1077
01:00:36,331 --> 01:00:39,393
And so I actually couldn't even tell you how long that took.

1078
01:00:39,393 --> 01:00:40,254
I think that that took.

1079
01:00:40,907 --> 01:00:45,908
you know, probably I would say maybe a month or two to generate all those different images,

1080
01:00:45,908 --> 01:00:50,110
of which I referenced about three or four to create the final model.

1081
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:55,491
The first time I made a dragon was, it took me almost three months, but that was because

1082
01:00:55,491 --> 01:00:58,132
it was a very iterative process.

1083
01:00:58,132 --> 01:01:01,634
You know, oftentimes the aesthetics that we want to go for, for instance, a really, really

1084
01:01:01,634 --> 01:01:06,975
long neck, et cetera, you know, when you're actually fighting the dragon and you're, you

1085
01:01:06,975 --> 01:01:08,796
know, early on when you were attacking this thing.

1086
01:01:09,224 --> 01:01:13,471
you're attacking it and it's facing you and so the head is right in your screen and the body's 40

1087
01:01:13,471 --> 01:01:19,522
feet away and so it just looks like a giant cartoon bobble head just like in your face the whole time

1088
01:01:19,522 --> 01:01:22,988
so like you know there was a bunch of these large scale iterations

1089
01:01:25,137 --> 01:01:29,999
The average monster or creature would take me about a month.

1090
01:01:29,999 --> 01:01:32,019
You know, that's about three, four weeks,

1091
01:01:32,019 --> 01:01:34,560
sometimes five, depending on the complexity

1092
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:35,660
of the art asset.

1093
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:38,001
And then from there, we get into animation.

1094
01:01:38,001 --> 01:01:41,682
And animation typically would also take about a month

1095
01:01:41,682 --> 01:01:43,743
to create the basic set of animations.

1096
01:01:43,743 --> 01:01:47,024
But invariably, there were lots of iterations

1097
01:01:47,024 --> 01:01:50,285
over the course of development.

1098
01:01:50,285 --> 01:01:52,826
I mean, all of the time, animators had to return

1099
01:01:52,826 --> 01:01:52,946
to

1100
01:01:54,746 --> 01:01:57,948
the original art asset, the original animation,

1101
01:01:57,948 --> 01:02:00,650
and just keep tweaking, keep tweaking, keep adding,

1102
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:02,471
keep bug fixing, that kind of thing.

1103
01:02:02,471 --> 01:02:06,354
And so from start to finish, from concept to finished

1104
01:02:06,354 --> 01:02:10,577
product, I would probably just round up to about four months

1105
01:02:10,577 --> 01:02:14,940
because, and half of that being.

1106
01:02:15,762 --> 01:02:18,364
well, maybe three months, but half of that being animation,

1107
01:02:18,364 --> 01:02:20,825
because animation is just very time consuming.

1108
01:02:20,825 --> 01:02:23,847
It requires a lot of polish to get right.

1109
01:02:23,847 --> 01:02:25,888
Yeah, so usually it would take me between three

1110
01:02:25,888 --> 01:02:27,849
to five weeks to finish something.

1111
01:02:27,849 --> 01:02:30,230
You know, if it was something easy,

1112
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:31,891
like just a circlet, you know,

1113
01:02:31,891 --> 01:02:35,053
I made the circlets with the gems in the game,

1114
01:02:35,053 --> 01:02:37,014
that took me two days.

1115
01:02:37,014 --> 01:02:39,375
The Dragon Priest that we just saw,

1116
01:02:39,375 --> 01:02:40,295
that took me about a month,

1117
01:02:40,295 --> 01:02:43,597
because it's a lot, you know, very complex uniform.

1118
01:02:45,056 --> 01:02:47,358
Yeah, so and then and then again, and so and then some

1119
01:02:47,358 --> 01:02:51,541
things, you know, the concept artist spends a couple hours on

1120
01:02:51,541 --> 01:02:54,303
and the art director might be like, yeah, perfect. That's

1121
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:57,725
great. Exactly what we're going for, you know, or they might

1122
01:02:57,725 --> 01:03:00,107
take a month. So it would you know, you can you can usually

1123
01:03:00,107 --> 01:03:03,569
more or less scale depending on the complexity of the art asset

1124
01:03:03,569 --> 01:03:08,072
and go from there. So from anywhere from eight hours on

1125
01:03:08,072 --> 01:03:12,035
something to a month of concepting anywhere from

1126
01:03:12,863 --> 01:03:15,845
12 hours of modeling and texturing to five weeks.

1127
01:03:15,845 --> 01:03:19,068
You know, and I'm not counting the dragon

1128
01:03:19,068 --> 01:03:22,010
in that large guesstimation

1129
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:23,752
because the dragon was so exceptional

1130
01:03:23,752 --> 01:03:26,434
and required such a mountain of labor.

1131
01:03:26,434 --> 01:03:30,077
But I can guarantee you that the animations of the dragon

1132
01:03:30,077 --> 01:03:33,219
took forever for the artist to make

1133
01:03:33,219 --> 01:03:34,280
and allotted back and forth.

1134
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:35,821
It takes a while.

1135
01:03:35,821 --> 01:03:38,203
And when you think about all the different creatures

1136
01:03:38,203 --> 01:03:39,224
and non-human things.

1137
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:43,124
You know, all the things that don't share a skeleton.

1138
01:03:43,124 --> 01:03:46,527
It's a lot of bandwidth for a small company like Bethesda.

1139
01:03:46,527 --> 01:03:47,228
That makes sense.

1140
01:03:47,228 --> 01:03:51,351
Speaking of animals, I forgot you were like humans or animals,

1141
01:03:51,351 --> 01:03:55,254
or I forgot to mention it, as some of you may have noticed, my animals,

1142
01:03:55,254 --> 01:03:58,477
my cats, whose GDC talks were rejected.

1143
01:03:58,477 --> 01:03:59,998
If you follow our GDC Twitter feed,

1144
01:03:59,998 --> 01:04:04,061
wonderful talk submissions were rejected, have been hanging out with us.

1145
01:04:04,861 --> 01:04:09,503
if you want. I don't, there's nothing productive about that. I just, they've been hanging out

1146
01:04:09,503 --> 01:04:16,385
so good on stream. I just want to share. Okay, we've got about 10 minutes ish left in this talk.

1147
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:20,907
Danny, thank you for joining us. I can see you've got to head out, but that's,

1148
01:04:20,907 --> 01:04:26,889
thank you so much for asking these questions. Yeah, I can only just keep saying, keep asking

1149
01:04:26,889 --> 01:04:30,391
questions because the ones I've got are just my own. Otherwise, otherwise I'm going to keep

1150
01:04:30,391 --> 01:04:34,232
talking about my cats. The game's just about to end. Oh, the game's just about to end. Cool.

1151
01:04:34,909 --> 01:04:43,334
We have a couple minutes. We can take a couple more questions while Alduin gets finished off.

1152
01:04:43,334 --> 01:04:48,097
We can also admire the beautiful Alduin model.

1153
01:04:48,097 --> 01:04:51,919
Admire it for 3, 2, 1, and we're done.

1154
01:04:51,919 --> 01:04:53,680
And we're done.

1155
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:54,300
And there goes...

1156
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:55,461
Look at the wings, though.

1157
01:04:55,461 --> 01:04:57,682
There goes 6 months of my life just burning up.

1158
01:04:57,682 --> 01:05:00,203
I got it on medium graphics just for you.

1159
01:05:00,203 --> 01:05:01,904
Oh, thank you.

1160
01:05:01,904 --> 01:05:03,625
Medium whole graphics.

1161
01:05:05,028 --> 01:05:05,970
Bumped it up from low to me.

1162
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:10,317
All those little meteorite, you know, inspired bubbling.

1163
01:05:10,317 --> 01:05:11,218
I don't know, I forget the phrase.

1164
01:05:11,218 --> 01:05:11,779
Oh my gosh.

1165
01:05:11,779 --> 01:05:13,022
The verb.

1166
01:05:13,022 --> 01:05:13,983
Yeah, a little cratering.

1167
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:18,110
Yeah, that's the thing about this is, you know, as a character artist and as a 3D artist.

1168
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:22,904
you know, I might spend a whole day on the underside, not the whole day, but half a day

1169
01:05:22,904 --> 01:05:28,588
on the underside of a character's foot, you know, and knowing that, you know, 99% of followers,

1170
01:05:28,588 --> 01:05:34,012
of viewers won't ever, ever see it or notice it, but it's always worth it for that 1% of people

1171
01:05:34,012 --> 01:05:38,555
who actually take the time to look at a model and check it out and see what's going on. Because

1172
01:05:38,555 --> 01:05:41,558
I invariably get comments from people or questions about like, oh, I noticed this,

1173
01:05:41,558 --> 01:05:45,581
I noticed that. And I'm like, cool, cool. So I'd spent that time like for you. Now I know,

1174
01:05:45,581 --> 01:05:47,402
like didn't go totally to waste.

1175
01:05:48,404 --> 01:05:59,871
It literally, I mean, like, hey, we'll take the, you know, we'll take six seconds of appearing on a GDC stream to entertain folks and entertain entertains bubbles and entertains folks at home.

1176
01:05:59,871 --> 01:06:00,471
We'll take it.

1177
01:06:00,471 --> 01:06:04,914
Bubbles, let me know when you want me to stop the timer because it is.

1178
01:06:04,914 --> 01:06:05,375
Oh yeah.

1179
01:06:05,375 --> 01:06:08,837
When Alduin dies, it's not like when his health bar went to zero, it gets stopped.

1180
01:06:08,837 --> 01:06:09,197
It's cool.

1181
01:06:09,197 --> 01:06:10,918
We have, we have no idea what the time was then.

1182
01:06:10,918 --> 01:06:12,099
It's just about one hour.

1183
01:06:12,099 --> 01:06:12,159
Um.

1184
01:06:13,145 --> 01:06:17,667
Anyway, yeah, let's take a couple minutes. Bubbles, feel free to show off any other tricks.

1185
01:06:17,667 --> 01:06:23,770
We've got, we'll say, we'll give it another three minutes here and then I'll ask for us to be

1186
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:29,412
quietly sunsetted and I'll read an outro. But we'll get a couple more questions in. Thank you.

1187
01:06:29,412 --> 01:06:32,654
Thank you, Christina Pigeon, for hanging out. We appreciate your company.

1188
01:06:32,654 --> 01:06:39,117
Matteo Fasano would like to know, could you elaborate on your modeling workflow in ZBrush?

1189
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:43,420
Is it important to have 2D drawing skills for making complex models?

1190
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:48,965
That's a good question. I get that a lot. No, it is not important. It's not vital.

1191
01:06:48,965 --> 01:06:53,348
It's always helpful. It's always good. You know, I think a lot of problem solving

1192
01:06:53,348 --> 01:06:59,973
comes through in two-dimensional art. So you can figure out a lot of things by being able to do

1193
01:06:59,973 --> 01:07:05,978
that. But no, I've seen some amazing 3D... I mean, I know a lot of amazing 3D artists who do not do

1194
01:07:05,978 --> 01:07:06,338
2D art.

1195
01:07:07,179 --> 01:07:10,940
I'm always of the mindset that art is complimentary and so that the things we learn when it comes

1196
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:12,461
to like 2D art, whether that's...

1197
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:13,642
Oh my god, this is hilarious.

1198
01:07:13,642 --> 01:07:14,142
What is that?

1199
01:07:14,142 --> 01:07:15,022
That is that scary.

1200
01:07:15,022 --> 01:07:16,763
You made this Jonah, come on.

1201
01:07:16,763 --> 01:07:18,004
Who threw it off?

1202
01:07:18,004 --> 01:07:18,364
It just works.

1203
01:07:18,364 --> 01:07:19,584
This is your fault.

1204
01:07:19,584 --> 01:07:20,485
Oh my gosh.

1205
01:07:20,485 --> 01:07:24,306
It's getting worse and worse with every moment.

1206
01:07:24,306 --> 01:07:24,667
Oh my god.

1207
01:07:24,667 --> 01:07:25,507
I'm so sorry.

1208
01:07:25,507 --> 01:07:26,187
I'm so sorry.

1209
01:07:26,187 --> 01:07:27,328
I'm so sorry.

1210
01:07:27,328 --> 01:07:27,988
I'm so sorry.

1211
01:07:27,988 --> 01:07:28,868
I'm so sorry.

1212
01:07:28,868 --> 01:07:29,509
I'm so sorry.

1213
01:07:29,509 --> 01:07:30,009
I'm so sorry.

1214
01:07:30,009 --> 01:07:32,070
I'm so sorry.

1215
01:07:32,070 --> 01:07:32,550
I'm so sorry.

1216
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:33,090
I'm so sorry.

1217
01:07:34,794 --> 01:07:43,083
Yeah, so it's, and then with regards to my workflow, I always work from the most simple

1218
01:07:43,083 --> 01:07:44,204
to the most complex.

1219
01:07:44,204 --> 01:07:50,631
So again, my work is known for being quite detailed, but I will always, always, always,

1220
01:07:50,631 --> 01:07:51,412
you know,

1221
01:07:52,552 --> 01:07:55,154
take a cue from, oh my god, this is so disturbing.

1222
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:57,176
I will take a cue from movies like Pixar,

1223
01:07:57,176 --> 01:07:59,098
that this and that, which were,

1224
01:07:59,098 --> 01:08:03,881
they are really so good at conveying so much with so little,

1225
01:08:03,881 --> 01:08:05,763
you know, so much like design,

1226
01:08:05,763 --> 01:08:08,805
like so much with like the big shapes and big forms.

1227
01:08:08,805 --> 01:08:10,827
I will take, so anything I make,

1228
01:08:10,827 --> 01:08:16,352
I start off with a very, very simple set of shapes,

1229
01:08:16,352 --> 01:08:17,152
and then I go from there.

1230
01:08:17,152 --> 01:08:18,874
And so that's one thing I really like about,

1231
01:08:19,975 --> 01:08:24,283
ZBrush and about the sculpting process is that I get to create something very basic,

1232
01:08:24,283 --> 01:08:28,410
very simple, and then continue to add on.

1233
01:08:29,782 --> 01:08:31,164
more and more complexity.

1234
01:08:31,164 --> 01:08:34,466
So I always have these different scales of design.

1235
01:08:34,466 --> 01:08:37,889
So when you look at the lines of the dragon's head

1236
01:08:37,889 --> 01:08:38,810
in this game, for instance,

1237
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:41,672
a lot of the contours of the head flow together.

1238
01:08:41,672 --> 01:08:43,994
So even though the dragon is very visually complex,

1239
01:08:43,994 --> 01:08:46,315
a lot of the shapes of the throat,

1240
01:08:46,315 --> 01:08:49,778
of the spines on its back, they all flow together.

1241
01:08:49,778 --> 01:08:54,101
And they form these very, very simple layouts.

1242
01:08:54,101 --> 01:08:57,064
And then I just kind of add on more and more complexity.

1243
01:08:58,585 --> 01:09:01,488
while always making sure to preserve the underlying aspects.

1244
01:09:01,488 --> 01:09:05,811
So, and I guess that's also another way in which two-dimensional art helps,

1245
01:09:05,811 --> 01:09:12,017
because being able to focus on the clean, pure shapes and lines,

1246
01:09:12,017 --> 01:09:16,621
first and foremost, makes it so that when you do start to pay attention

1247
01:09:16,621 --> 01:09:18,522
and start to focus on adding all this little detail,

1248
01:09:18,522 --> 01:09:21,745
you're preserving what amounts to the fundamental...

1249
01:09:22,266 --> 01:09:25,949
visual power and thrust of whatever you've created.

1250
01:09:25,949 --> 01:09:30,574
So keeping it simple is is the best always.

1251
01:09:30,574 --> 01:09:33,336
Don't I appreciate your participation in the Give Serious Game Dev

1252
01:09:33,336 --> 01:09:36,760
Answers while watching horrible nightmares be rendered on screen in front of you.

1253
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:39,502
That was that was I'm going to be dreaming about that tonight for sure.

1254
01:09:40,097 --> 01:09:43,658
Real quick, we're getting close to wrapping things up.

1255
01:09:43,658 --> 01:09:44,439
Here's what we're going to do.

1256
01:09:44,439 --> 01:09:46,239
There's one more question in chat that I want to grab

1257
01:09:46,239 --> 01:09:46,880
from Steve Kuhnhus.

1258
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:50,061
We're going to make that the last question of this.

1259
01:09:50,061 --> 01:09:52,922
Want to give a shout out to folks like Michael Gibbs,

1260
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:55,343
chemistry editor-in-chief Chris Graft in chat,

1261
01:09:55,343 --> 01:09:58,044
Sean McPherson, Tim Brangle, Jessica Mao.

1262
01:09:58,044 --> 01:09:59,645
Thank you all for watching.

1263
01:09:59,645 --> 01:10:01,506
We appreciate having you on for this weird experiment.

1264
01:10:01,506 --> 01:10:03,087
We haven't tried anything like this before.

1265
01:10:03,087 --> 01:10:04,507
We haven't tried a virtual GDC.

1266
01:10:04,507 --> 01:10:06,288
We haven't tried beaming in game developers

1267
01:10:06,288 --> 01:10:07,008
and speed runners.

1268
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:11,692
and having the former watch the latter. This is new, and the fact that you have all joined us

1269
01:10:11,692 --> 01:10:16,716
here for this experiment is really wonderful. Normally, when we start these sessions, we say

1270
01:10:16,716 --> 01:10:19,378
turn off your cell phones and remember to do your session evaluations, but guess what?

1271
01:10:19,378 --> 01:10:24,743
You can keep your cell phones on because you're at home, but please do fill out your session

1272
01:10:24,743 --> 01:10:28,966
evaluations. If not for this, I don't know if there are session evaluations for this stream,

1273
01:10:28,966 --> 01:10:31,968
but for any other talks you do, please fill out.

1274
01:10:32,461 --> 01:10:36,043
uh... the evaluations for the end of the show the official survey all that helps

1275
01:10:36,043 --> 01:10:38,344
us make a better gpc for the future

1276
01:10:38,344 --> 01:10:41,965
uh... and we're gonna be back later this week with two more speed runs for

1277
01:10:41,965 --> 01:10:46,067
ukulele in the impossible air and star wars republic commando of those both

1278
01:10:46,067 --> 01:10:47,168
should be a lot of fun

1279
01:10:47,168 --> 01:10:51,110
uh... if you wanna find me i'm on twitter are brian twenty twelve jonah

1280
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:52,610
and bubbles where can they find you

1281
01:10:52,610 --> 01:10:53,411
uh...

1282
01:10:55,451 --> 01:11:00,595
I can be found on twitch.tv slash bubblestuffuego, bubblestuffuego.com.

1283
01:11:00,595 --> 01:11:03,437
So it just redirects to Twitch and my Twitter is the same.

1284
01:11:03,437 --> 01:11:05,419
It's all just that word.

1285
01:11:05,419 --> 01:11:08,381
So Twitter, YouTube and Twitch.

1286
01:11:08,381 --> 01:11:10,042
I primarily stream on Twitch.

1287
01:11:10,042 --> 01:11:15,146
Lately I've been doing Halo 3 but, you know, I've had a bunch of stuff in a lot of games

1288
01:11:15,146 --> 01:11:16,027
so you never know what I'll do.

1289
01:11:16,027 --> 01:11:16,447
Roger that.

1290
01:11:16,447 --> 01:11:20,070
And Jonah, where can folks get in touch with you if they have more questions?

1291
01:11:20,767 --> 01:11:25,110
Sure, you can find me I do a live stream about once or twice a week on Twitch.

1292
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:31,036
That's twitch.tv slash Jonah Loeb. You can find me on Twitter at Jonah Loeb. That's probably the

1293
01:11:31,036 --> 01:11:35,319
best place to answer me and to ask questions. My website is jonahloeb.com. You can also send

1294
01:11:35,319 --> 01:11:39,983
me messages there. And I'm on Instagram at I am Jonah Loeb.

1295
01:11:41,212 --> 01:11:41,732
So yeah.

1296
01:11:41,732 --> 01:11:43,993
So here's our last question for the day from Steve Kuhn.

1297
01:11:43,993 --> 01:11:45,714
How many LODs of the dragons are there?

1298
01:11:45,714 --> 01:11:48,155
I don't know if you're supposed to pronounce that LODs,

1299
01:11:48,155 --> 01:11:49,696
but how many LODs of the dragons?

1300
01:11:49,696 --> 01:11:50,376
We always call it LODs.

1301
01:11:50,376 --> 01:11:52,317
Gosh, I don't know.

1302
01:11:52,317 --> 01:11:55,079
I think there's only maybe like,

1303
01:11:55,079 --> 01:11:56,199
I think there's only one.

1304
01:11:56,199 --> 01:12:00,181
I think there's like the basic one,

1305
01:12:00,181 --> 01:12:02,983
and then there's like the LOD version.

1306
01:12:04,844 --> 01:12:07,989
architecture and landscape, it's a lot more levels.

1307
01:12:07,989 --> 01:12:09,952
But for the dragons, I think it was more basic.

1308
01:12:09,952 --> 01:12:12,196
Or maybe there was two, maybe there's two, yeah.

1309
01:12:12,196 --> 01:12:14,099
Yeah, that was always really fun,

1310
01:12:14,099 --> 01:12:16,563
taking my precious art and crunching it down

1311
01:12:16,563 --> 01:12:18,345
to something just awful in distance.

1312
01:12:19,438 --> 01:12:23,041
That was one of the things about working with Bethesda,

1313
01:12:23,041 --> 01:12:24,983
is I'm a stickler for all this detail, et cetera.

1314
01:12:24,983 --> 01:12:28,045
And I remember when we made Fallout 3,

1315
01:12:28,045 --> 01:12:32,910
and I made the radroach, and Todd Howard

1316
01:12:32,910 --> 01:12:33,870
was just basically telling me,

1317
01:12:33,870 --> 01:12:35,772
like, it looks great, but you need to,

1318
01:12:35,772 --> 01:12:36,473
you know, it's 6,000 polys,

1319
01:12:36,473 --> 01:12:38,274
you need to cut that number down a lot.

1320
01:12:38,274 --> 01:12:41,077
And I remember, you know, even as new character artist,

1321
01:12:41,077 --> 01:12:42,418
I was kind of arguing with Todd.

1322
01:12:42,418 --> 01:12:44,339
I was like, no, it's got wings, and it's got a shell,

1323
01:12:44,339 --> 01:12:45,661
and it's got six legs, and ta-da,

1324
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:47,122
and I can't possibly do that.

1325
01:12:48,082 --> 01:12:51,203
But I remember when he, you know, I would often make a creature for the game,

1326
01:12:51,203 --> 01:12:56,105
give it this high-res texture and he would say, that looks great, you know, that looks, I love it.

1327
01:12:56,105 --> 01:13:01,326
Now cut the texture down, you know, quarter your texture. And I would just, and every time I would

1328
01:13:01,326 --> 01:13:04,427
just be like, damn you, Todd, like, why would you do this to me? Like, I don't want, no, why? And

1329
01:13:04,427 --> 01:13:10,688
then I would do it and then I would quarter the texture and I'd be like, oh, I made this and I

1330
01:13:10,688 --> 01:13:15,130
can't even tell the difference. And so I guess this is why you run the show.

1331
01:13:17,127 --> 01:13:18,789
I would I would say the second part.

1332
01:13:18,789 --> 01:13:20,130
I keep that second part to myself.

1333
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:22,612
And I'd be like, oh, oh, oh, so we can't find Todd.

1334
01:13:22,612 --> 01:13:24,894
Oh, so we delete this part of the archive is what you're saying.

1335
01:13:24,894 --> 01:13:26,416
We can't let him find out.

1336
01:13:26,416 --> 01:13:26,916
No, no, no. I can't.

1337
01:13:26,916 --> 01:13:30,219
I can't let him know that I was giving him all the credit he deserves.

1338
01:13:30,219 --> 01:13:33,502
But ending on a Todd Howard anecdote feels like the right way to do this.

1339
01:13:33,502 --> 01:13:35,724
So with that, bye, everyone.

1340
01:13:35,724 --> 01:13:39,288
Make sure to wear a mask when you go outdoors.

1341
01:13:39,288 --> 01:13:41,289
We are going to go home now. Bye. Bye. Bye.
