1
00:00:12,365 --> 00:00:20,849
So hello everyone and welcome to Making Chaotic Great Finding Precedent in Unprecedented Times, Making Tiny Tina's Wonderlands.

2
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,372
I'm Kayla Belmore, the Senior Producer on the project, and this is Matt Cox, Creative Director.

3
00:00:25,762 --> 00:00:27,023
Hey folks, thanks again for coming.

4
00:00:27,043 --> 00:00:31,166
This is awesome that you guys are all here, but a little bit more about us before we get started.

5
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:32,907
Again, my name is Matt Cox.

6
00:00:33,047 --> 00:00:42,414
I was born in Washington, D.C., but I grew up most of my life right outside of Kansas City in Kansas, and I am a shameless Nintendo nerd for as long as I can remember.

7
00:00:43,055 --> 00:00:48,779
And about high school times, I wanted to have a really robust music career and go on the road, but I figured that was going to be pretty

8
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:49,299
Halo PC

9
00:01:09,367 --> 00:01:21,675
Gearbox released Halo PC and then the Halo editing kit and that was the first time I was able to spawn Master Chief on a piece of geometry that I created from a totally legit copy of 3ds Max.

10
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:29,780
But that, it was that moment that I realized that, oh my gosh, I really want to do this for a living.

11
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:36,224
And so I started creating a bunch of level designs but I had a moment where I was like, well, do I want to choose the art path

12
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:38,465
or the design path.

13
00:01:38,545 --> 00:01:43,027
So I went out and bought a book on how to for illustration.

14
00:01:43,147 --> 00:01:48,329
And the first task at the end of the first chapter was like, draw someone from memory.

15
00:01:48,429 --> 00:01:52,731
And of course, who did I choose but my lovely wife, Emily.

16
00:01:53,371 --> 00:01:55,312
And this was my illustration.

17
00:01:59,653 --> 00:01:59,913
Thank you

18
00:02:18,184 --> 00:02:23,587
During that hiatus, I made four little micro games for Android and iOS as well as Steam.

19
00:02:23,847 --> 00:02:34,152
And then I came back to AAA on Borderlands, did a bunch of design stuff for Borderlands 3, then directed the campaign expansion, Bounty of Blood, and then I landed as creative director on Wonderlands.

20
00:02:35,433 --> 00:02:41,676
And if you have any questions about the design track versus the production track and the mindset, just look at our slide differences.

21
00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:57,542
So my job in the industry, my very first one was as a personal assistant back in 2010 at Irrational Games, and I worked my way up through the ranks and learned everything I could about production and became a senior producer at Gearbox eventually.

22
00:02:59,022 --> 00:03:00,522
I had some weird pandemic hobbies.

23
00:03:00,642 --> 00:03:01,303
Everyone did.

24
00:03:01,343 --> 00:03:02,983
This is some great icebreaker material.

25
00:03:03,323 --> 00:03:05,363
I started befriending my neighborhood crows.

26
00:03:05,463 --> 00:03:08,524
Now they land on my chimney and scream at me if I don't give them peanuts.

27
00:03:09,264 --> 00:03:10,905
I also collect antique cookbooks.

28
00:03:10,965 --> 00:03:12,885
So if you need an aspect recipe, I got you.

29
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,886
I asked some friends to describe me, and here are some quotes.

30
00:03:17,126 --> 00:03:21,192
I am always one drink or hangry away from coming back to my Boston accent.

31
00:03:21,372 --> 00:03:22,133
Wicked pissa kid.

32
00:03:23,394 --> 00:03:26,318
And I am the living embodiment of all trash birds.

33
00:03:27,059 --> 00:03:28,120
And that's a seagull, Matt.

34
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:28,801
Okay, seagulls.

35
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:29,101
Got it.

36
00:03:29,182 --> 00:03:29,282
Yeah.

37
00:03:31,494 --> 00:03:34,356
and I have been dubbed the official project mom.

38
00:03:34,796 --> 00:03:38,939
Whenever we go somewhere, whenever we travel, I just hear, mom, can we get a meal?

39
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,421
And that's how it happens.

40
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:44,423
And I love putting this in here, this little quiz at the end.

41
00:03:44,464 --> 00:03:50,388
If you can read those acronyms, if you know, you know, it's either a localist or a DSM V5 diagnostic.

42
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:54,551
I made two sets of people in the room uncomfortable with that one.

43
00:03:54,591 --> 00:03:55,231
Fantastic.

44
00:03:57,011 --> 00:04:03,434
The reason why I put this in here, and it's going to become more important later and apparent in this talk, is that, yeah, it's hard.

45
00:04:03,755 --> 00:04:05,115
It's hard up here sometimes.

46
00:04:05,736 --> 00:04:12,159
And you can still be a leader and you can still do it, but it's going to take a lot of work and proactive effort to make that happen.

47
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:17,402
You'll learn a little bit more about that later and how we decided to manage Wonderlands in unprecedented times.

48
00:04:19,482 --> 00:04:40,198
Quick look at my ship titles, started with Bioshock Infinite, worked on the DLC, started at the season pass of Battleborn, so I worked a little bit of production on the art pipeline on that post-launch content, did work on Borderlands 3 as a pipeline producer as well as an AP, and then became a senior producer on Wonderlands.

49
00:04:42,614 --> 00:04:46,458
So, developing precedent in unprecedented times.

50
00:04:46,538 --> 00:04:52,064
So first we want to call out the three time periods that kind of happened to all of us over the last several years.

51
00:04:52,144 --> 00:04:55,468
There is the before times, pre-lockdown.

52
00:04:56,108 --> 00:05:04,197
We had precedent on how pipelines worked, how relationships worked, how we reacted to the new challenges of just normal development.

53
00:05:04,497 --> 00:05:07,678
Your studio had those precedents, and so did we.

54
00:05:08,198 --> 00:05:10,619
But then, the lockdown happened.

55
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:24,942
These were obviously unprecedented times, it was a novel environment, and we had to make more proactive choices for empathy, understanding, and advocating for the health of our teams.

56
00:05:25,642 --> 00:05:28,443
And during lockdown, our nature was amplified.

57
00:05:29,183 --> 00:05:35,250
especially with how we react to harsh circumstances or strong disagreements.

58
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:45,101
So when people have that fight or flight or freeze response, we had to develop the habit of assuming the best in all of us.

59
00:05:45,982 --> 00:06:00,709
And then present times, when we came through the lockdown, we had better tools and a better lens for proactive problem-solving, and we were better prepared for change.

60
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:04,730
One of the biggest things that we learned is you don't naturally have to do combat.

61
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:09,813
Not every disagreement has to be combat.

62
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:20,475
And when it comes to Kayla and I, we're very fortunate because before we started working together, we kind of already agree on a lot about the intersection of scope and quality.

63
00:06:20,776 --> 00:06:26,437
But we know there are stereotypes of the roles of creative director versus project producer.

64
00:06:27,297 --> 00:06:30,438
And stereotypes look about like those fighting cats over there.

65
00:06:31,278 --> 00:06:34,879
And that's because these roles in some ways are diametrically

66
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:43,456
My job is to make sure that it ships and sometimes those things are just in disagreement.

67
00:06:44,256 --> 00:06:53,741
It can lead to this idea in the industry where producers are the sanity and creative direction is the vanity or if you're on the other side of the coin, the kill versus the joy.

68
00:06:54,421 --> 00:06:54,501
of

69
00:07:16,545 --> 00:07:23,809
And it's really important to make sure that when you're thinking about production, you're also quality minded because the quality of your game cuts into profits.

70
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:27,351
And it makes it so you can probably get more money to make great games later.

71
00:07:27,811 --> 00:07:38,957
As a creative director, it's really important to make sure that you're thinking a little bit about production and the pipelines and the constraints that your projects are under to have realistic expectations and decisions and avoid things like crunch when you can.

72
00:07:39,797 --> 00:07:49,019
So instead of going into a divided mentality that us versus them culture, we decided that it was the most important thing to work together.

73
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:55,560
As Matt said, we already kind of were on that same track of like, I like a good quality game, I like a fun game, and he likes to ship games.

74
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:59,241
So may as well work together and make it work.

75
00:07:59,341 --> 00:08:06,843
And that became so important to make a conscious decision to wake up and go to the office virtually every day during the pandemic.

76
00:08:07,783 --> 00:08:14,750
and understand that we were making that decision together even when things were hard and even when it was just awful.

77
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:20,075
And feeling awful means that it's a lot harder to come to the table with compromise.

78
00:08:20,715 --> 00:08:23,278
And that is something that we funneled down to the team.

79
00:08:23,578 --> 00:08:29,544
When they saw us working together, they were more likely to work empathically across departments and understand each other's constraints.

80
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:37,565
And at the end of the day, we avoided a lot of toxicity that could have happened and we've seen happen on other projects and at other studios.

81
00:08:38,506 --> 00:08:43,271
And that was super important to us and we made a great game as sane as we possibly could.

82
00:08:43,771 --> 00:08:52,740
So, how did we prevent all of this toxicity during unprecedented times and how did we work together?

83
00:08:56,161 --> 00:09:08,947
So we developed a proactive precedent, and these are sort of, not all, but three of the main pillars or the lens that we try to direct with through our entire process.

84
00:09:09,427 --> 00:09:11,248
Scope-minded creative direction.

85
00:09:12,108 --> 00:09:16,431
quality minded production, and whole health advocacy.

86
00:09:16,511 --> 00:09:21,014
And that's what we're going to spend the rest of the time today sort of unpacking these three pillars.

87
00:09:21,415 --> 00:09:30,181
And we're hoping that the learnings that we have can better help in all lanes of development, no matter what the title or what the department.

88
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,565
So what is scope-minded creative direction?

89
00:09:35,765 --> 00:09:43,595
Well, first of all, we want to have our developers create achievable design goals from the very beginning.

90
00:09:44,155 --> 00:09:46,779
See, we know that there is going to be a mount of scope creep.

91
00:09:47,539 --> 00:09:49,821
The goal is not to have no scope creep.

92
00:09:49,841 --> 00:09:52,564
There's always going to be an element of scope creep.

93
00:09:52,604 --> 00:10:01,851
So the more that you can prepare and buffer that from the beginning to the best of your ability, the better the development is going to be.

94
00:10:02,452 --> 00:10:10,218
And also, we want to have our developers, not just production lanes, take timelines seriously.

95
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:13,380
Report issues early and often.

96
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,261
Be transparent with your leads and your teams at all times.

97
00:10:20,843 --> 00:10:27,245
Because you never want those above to be caught flat-footed.

98
00:10:27,686 --> 00:10:33,528
We want all teams to be very aware of the challenges every moment of every milestone.

99
00:10:33,748 --> 00:10:38,410
Because we don't want anybody else to get caught flat-footed with scope mishaps.

100
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:38,950
So yes,

101
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:44,333
make the effort to understand the full array of time and resource limitations.

102
00:10:44,414 --> 00:10:54,981
We don't want designers or any other developer to create and work in a complete vacuum, not understanding how every choice affects downstream departments.

103
00:10:55,381 --> 00:11:03,926
It is okay for artists and designers and programmers to understand the totality of how production lanes work.

104
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:06,868
Understand where they bottleneck.

105
00:11:07,408 --> 00:11:10,089
Teaching teams to understand scope, not just creating that vacuum.

106
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:16,410
And it's okay, and I dare say necessary, to educate our teams in how all of that works.

107
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:22,392
Every choice affects more than just you in your seat.

108
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:27,854
And that is an okay thing to teach in the design department.

109
00:11:28,274 --> 00:11:47,129
So, once you have those constraints, and you understand all of the limitations, let the constraints spark the creativity, instead of letting unchecked blue sky mode persist beyond the concept phase, where that's obviously a lot more buffer time to allow.

110
00:11:48,755 --> 00:11:49,716
scope minded creative direction

111
00:12:09,073 --> 00:12:12,677
and so we want to choose our innovations carefully.

112
00:12:12,697 --> 00:12:13,738
It doesn't mean you don't innovate.

113
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:24,450
It doesn't mean you don't add a plus one to your IP or whatever new thing you're bringing to the table because it is the job of the designer to bring something new to the table.

114
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:28,771
or brings something new to the IP, of course.

115
00:12:28,951 --> 00:12:32,773
But not everything needs to be original.

116
00:12:33,393 --> 00:12:39,295
And I'm glad this is the production summit and not the design summit, because I get so many more boos in the design summit.

117
00:12:40,736 --> 00:12:44,357
But I know it sounds controversial, right?

118
00:12:45,356 --> 00:12:51,960
but effective content is better than original content for the sake of being original.

119
00:12:52,701 --> 00:12:58,044
Sometimes it is better to be effective than original.

120
00:12:59,004 --> 00:13:01,866
Originality should never come at the expense of being effective.

121
00:13:01,926 --> 00:13:07,390
Sometimes it's better to be effective than original and not reinvent every wheel.

122
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:21,455
Instead, knowing your constraints, be calculated with what parts you choose to innovate, and prove the fun first.

123
00:13:22,175 --> 00:13:28,398
Spend the innovation effort on the things that you have proven early.

124
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:33,980
Find the fun early and find it cheaply.

125
00:13:34,721 --> 00:13:39,203
If you need a ton of animation polish and pretty art to make it fun, guess what?

126
00:13:39,323 --> 00:13:40,104
It wasn't fun.

127
00:13:42,064 --> 00:13:44,666
But understand your constraints.

128
00:13:44,946 --> 00:13:50,649
I believe that amazing creativity can come from within constraints.

129
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,411
So prototype a lot, cheaply, early.

130
00:13:54,491 --> 00:13:56,453
Bring something new to the table, definitely.

131
00:13:56,573 --> 00:14:00,155
Even if it's just new to the IP itself, right?

132
00:14:01,036 --> 00:14:03,218
And embrace performance limitations.

133
00:14:03,398 --> 00:14:04,939
Embrace memory limitations.

134
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:07,421
Learn to be creative within constraints.

135
00:14:07,461 --> 00:14:08,802
And this is what I kind of like to say.

136
00:14:08,902 --> 00:14:09,783
These are the LEGOs.

137
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:13,586
You have a bunch of LEGOs that are gathered from a bunch of different sets and the plans.

138
00:14:13,626 --> 00:14:16,728
You've lost the plans and a bunch of pieces from all of the other LEGOs.

139
00:14:16,948 --> 00:14:19,250
But you have the bucket of LEGOs that you now understand.

140
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,391
Dump it on the table.

141
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:21,851
These are the LEGOs.

142
00:14:22,492 --> 00:14:23,152
Build something.

143
00:14:41,861 --> 00:14:42,662
our motivation

144
00:15:11,801 --> 00:15:13,783
talking about

145
00:15:35,023 --> 00:15:35,724
help your team

146
00:15:43,513 --> 00:15:54,342
The people that are the powers that be are going to want the better game and the more profitable game anyway, and they're going to force the change, and it's going to be more costly and more expensive and more detrimental to the physical and mental health of your team.

147
00:15:54,862 --> 00:16:08,033
So understand going into this that your plan, your beautiful, brilliant production plan that is in three places, and it's in JIRA, and it's at Gantt Chart, and it is wonderful, is not going to survive contact with the team.

148
00:16:08,894 --> 00:16:11,836
Something is going to go wonky, and that

149
00:16:12,677 --> 00:16:21,062
might be a bad plan, it might be absolutely outside of your control because suddenly a department becomes shorthanded or you couldn't get the recruiting that you need.

150
00:16:21,082 --> 00:16:25,125
There are a million reasons that the plan just goes bad, and that's okay.

151
00:16:25,525 --> 00:16:37,473
Make a new plan and work with your team to help them realize their goals within the constraints that you need to set, because sometimes there are hard constraints, but you need to make those understood, so not everything's a fight.

152
00:16:38,979 --> 00:16:48,865
And that also means advocating for the team when those limitations, those hard constraints, those very, very real deadlines, resource issues.

153
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:57,803
pandemic, all of those things sometimes make the current schedule, the current plan just not livable for the team.

154
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:09,126
As production, it is our job to report those issues and become the advocates when our teams do not have the things that they need to do to make a good project.

155
00:17:09,266 --> 00:17:14,407
We are the advocates, we are a conduit, and we are the removers of roadblocks.

156
00:17:15,031 --> 00:17:24,238
So that means that we have to speak up and say something, even if it's just about making quality better, because good quality on time, that's the magic right there.

157
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:28,682
And it has to be said, and this is really good for any leader.

158
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:30,723
You have to say the words.

159
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:34,166
You have to say that the limitations are there.

160
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:42,713
You can't just assume that if a department only has two people left in it, everybody knows that you're going to have to rely less on that department.

161
00:17:43,143 --> 00:17:52,335
It has to be said because everyone is hyper focused on their own lanes and leaders and producers in particular have a unique view of the project where we get the bird's eye.

162
00:17:52,695 --> 00:17:53,977
We get the thousand foot view.

163
00:17:54,077 --> 00:17:57,221
We are the ones that have to set those expectations for the team.

164
00:17:58,237 --> 00:18:05,002
And another unpopular thing with producers, because most of us have a very similar high-strung mindset, you can't control it all.

165
00:18:05,483 --> 00:18:06,243
Stop trying.

166
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:06,984
No, really.

167
00:18:07,344 --> 00:18:09,246
You will drive yourself like a little bit nuts.

168
00:18:09,526 --> 00:18:10,006
I have done it.

169
00:18:10,306 --> 00:18:11,608
I'm still not recovered from it.

170
00:18:12,028 --> 00:18:13,789
You cannot control it all.

171
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:20,715
And I say this as someone who ridiculously went into Tiny Tina's Wonderlands as the only senior producer on the project.

172
00:18:26,983 --> 00:18:35,748
So how did I approach it as a leader on Tiny Tina's Wonderlands to help the game move forward within constraints but at a good quality?

173
00:18:36,688 --> 00:18:47,334
The most important thing that I came to every meeting thinking and I tried to impress upon the rest of the production team working on the project is that we do negotiation before negation.

174
00:18:48,835 --> 00:18:51,737
Do not say no to things on principle.

175
00:18:53,092 --> 00:18:54,733
It's just not good for the project.

176
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:56,195
It's not good for your team.

177
00:18:56,415 --> 00:19:03,341
A lot of the times when a designer comes and requests something or when a change needs to happen, there's flexibility there.

178
00:19:03,401 --> 00:19:05,062
So it's your job to be flexible too.

179
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:12,288
Help get to the goal and help them understand where the constraints are before just saying no.

180
00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:20,755
You can say, hey, that whole thing might not be tenable, but if we cut something else that's less important or scale it down, we might be able to get halfway there.

181
00:19:21,736 --> 00:19:24,657
Those conversations are key to building trust.

182
00:19:25,257 --> 00:19:27,817
And it also takes transparent communication.

183
00:19:28,878 --> 00:19:39,440
As long as you are being, as long as your motivation is good and you're being honest in a way that is not damaging, transparency is the way to go.

184
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,361
You will regret it far fewer times than you will obscuring information.

185
00:19:45,201 --> 00:19:47,161
And nothing, again, is implicit.

186
00:19:47,201 --> 00:19:49,882
And I will say that a few times because there are so many

187
00:19:51,397 --> 00:19:51,657
time.

188
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,881
And that also leads into expectation management.

189
00:20:17,121 --> 00:20:25,622
If you tell the team where our constraints are, where our challenges are, and where the freedom is, they are empowered to make better decisions to help the game move forward.

190
00:20:26,103 --> 00:20:31,704
Trust that in this industry, we're working with all really smart, pretty cool people.

191
00:20:32,404 --> 00:20:42,906
Most humans want to be good to other humans, but if they're lacking context and information, they're going to just move forward with blinders on and make the best decision for their department and throw things over the fence.

192
00:20:43,542 --> 00:21:01,555
If you foster empathy across teams, educate people on the pipeline and what it takes for a character to go from concept to in the game across the teams, even the production department, it's really important that you know your pipeline, it's going to make everything move a lot easier.

193
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:05,538
People will be more willing to work with each other because you've created empathy.

194
00:21:05,858 --> 00:21:10,041
You have created understanding between departments and you will get less siloed work.

195
00:21:11,567 --> 00:21:14,910
I also fundamentally believe that leadership is a service role.

196
00:21:17,272 --> 00:21:18,272
It's okay to be a leader.

197
00:21:18,353 --> 00:21:20,254
It's okay to make decisions half the time.

198
00:21:20,274 --> 00:21:22,916
That's the hard part of our job, is making those hard decisions.

199
00:21:22,996 --> 00:21:25,859
But you're not there to crack the whip and tell everyone just what to do.

200
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:29,402
You're not going to make any designer just work faster.

201
00:21:29,882 --> 00:21:31,043
Artists love to hear that.

202
00:21:31,303 --> 00:21:33,005
Go ahead and try that with the art department.

203
00:21:33,545 --> 00:21:33,825
Don't.

204
00:21:34,045 --> 00:21:34,566
Really don't.

205
00:21:36,576 --> 00:21:37,457
You are a service.

206
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:42,902
You are the person on the curling team with a little broom helping that thing get across the way.

207
00:21:43,103 --> 00:21:46,005
You are the air traffic controller.

208
00:21:46,106 --> 00:21:46,966
You are the plumber.

209
00:21:48,047 --> 00:21:49,069
Leadership is messy.

210
00:21:49,189 --> 00:21:49,809
It's scary.

211
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:53,913
And if you feel uncomfortable with it, you're probably doing it right.

212
00:21:54,073 --> 00:22:00,500
If you feel like everything's going great and you're just on high giving orders, something's probably going wrong that you don't know about.

213
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,311
And that's important to build that trust.

214
00:22:04,592 --> 00:22:05,873
And I talk about trust a lot.

215
00:22:07,674 --> 00:22:09,375
Negotiation requires trust.

216
00:22:09,835 --> 00:22:22,484
The team coming to you and feeling safe to bring up problems if scope is untenable, if there's something that needs to change in the schedule, if there's something that needs to change in the content, they need to trust you.

217
00:22:23,888 --> 00:22:26,672
and they need to trust that you will do something about it.

218
00:22:27,453 --> 00:22:28,374
And you have to.

219
00:22:28,534 --> 00:22:29,575
You have to follow through.

220
00:22:30,096 --> 00:22:32,139
And that sometimes means showing your work.

221
00:22:32,499 --> 00:22:33,541
Napkin math, great.

222
00:22:33,781 --> 00:22:34,842
Gut checks, amazing.

223
00:22:34,882 --> 00:22:36,004
You'll probably be right.

224
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,707
All of you have probably been in this industry a hot minute.

225
00:22:39,228 --> 00:22:41,691
And those gut checks, almost always right.

226
00:22:43,365 --> 00:22:51,968
If you have to report these issues up to anybody that's in the powers that be, or if you have to report these issues to a different team, you are going to have to show your work.

227
00:22:52,028 --> 00:22:58,411
You're going to come up with material truth because people believe data over feelings.

228
00:22:58,551 --> 00:22:59,551
Feelings are not fact.

229
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:00,672
Feelings are subjective.

230
00:23:00,972 --> 00:23:01,812
Data is not.

231
00:23:02,392 --> 00:23:07,314
So you need to show your work and be able to build your case to do that follow through for your team.

232
00:23:07,834 --> 00:23:11,896
And if you do follow through, you will build that trust and make that feedback loop a lot better.

233
00:23:14,673 --> 00:23:23,446
So this is arguably, from my view, kind of the biggest takeaway that we learned over the course of the pandemic.

234
00:23:23,466 --> 00:23:26,690
And it's something we're calling whole health advocacy.

235
00:23:27,311 --> 00:23:29,254
So instead of waiting for a moment,

236
00:23:29,935 --> 00:23:35,056
for an issue to arrive and just try to firefight and get rid of something.

237
00:23:35,376 --> 00:23:45,458
Instead, build an actual habit of advocating for your team's whole health, from mental health to physical health.

238
00:23:45,978 --> 00:23:50,819
And we were trying to come up with some phrase that kind of captured a lot of this.

239
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:52,719
And we didn't want to say the term health care.

240
00:23:52,939 --> 00:23:53,799
Sorry, health care.

241
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,860
Well, self-care.

242
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,240
Sorry.

243
00:23:57,296 --> 00:23:57,756
Different talk.

244
00:23:59,078 --> 00:24:08,545
We didn't want to say self-care due to the association with possible toxic positivity, because it doesn't always give a full picture, right?

245
00:24:08,886 --> 00:24:13,610
We don't mean anything by whole health advocacy, anything like fake happiness.

246
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,671
This isn't about fake happiness.

247
00:24:15,731 --> 00:24:19,815
We mean whole health advocacy, mental to physical and beyond.

248
00:24:19,915 --> 00:24:22,157
But before you can advocate

249
00:24:22,677 --> 00:24:36,684
effectively or authentically for your team's whole health, you have to take a look inside and advocate for your own whole health and figure out what that means for you to move forward.

250
00:24:36,744 --> 00:24:41,646
So it's the old rule, put on your own oxygen mask first.

251
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:47,602
So, some of you are probably thinking, but why is it important?

252
00:24:47,642 --> 00:24:49,765
I can just work until I die, and that's fine.

253
00:24:50,306 --> 00:24:50,747
It's not.

254
00:24:51,007 --> 00:24:52,710
Producers in the room, I got you.

255
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:54,533
You need boundaries.

256
00:24:55,743 --> 00:25:00,088
As speaking as someone who had trouble with this, you need to set boundaries.

257
00:25:00,588 --> 00:25:03,411
A work-life balance is extremely important.

258
00:25:03,452 --> 00:25:15,204
There will be times that you might have to push, that it's unavoidable, but then the times that are your down times in between, don't feel guilt for not being busy every second of the day if it doesn't warrant it.

259
00:25:16,085 --> 00:25:19,706
Don't feel guilt for taking a day off if you need it.

260
00:25:20,346 --> 00:25:26,108
Your sanity meter is key to the project, especially the higher up you get in leadership.

261
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:31,289
If you come to work in a nasty mood, that sets the tone for the team for the day.

262
00:25:31,689 --> 00:25:40,212
If you can't pick yourself up, it's better to just walk away before you accidentally start a fight or you become combative for no reason or you're just down.

263
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:41,212
The team will see that.

264
00:25:41,492 --> 00:25:44,913
It's advice I got early on in my career and it still maintains truth.

265
00:25:45,453 --> 00:25:57,157
The more I can present myself calmly and approach issues calmly and approach challenges in a logical way and still be able to deal with anybody else's feelings, the better it is.

266
00:25:57,597 --> 00:26:00,838
You need to have the spoons to support your team.

267
00:26:01,258 --> 00:26:06,140
So keep that sanity meter up by maintaining some work-life balance and step away if you have to.

268
00:26:07,295 --> 00:26:07,355
and

269
00:26:23,926 --> 00:26:24,206
talk

270
00:26:40,029 --> 00:26:40,449
science.

271
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,231
It is in your brains.

272
00:26:42,271 --> 00:26:43,191
This is how we work.

273
00:26:43,231 --> 00:26:44,712
This is not some woo woo stuff.

274
00:26:44,732 --> 00:26:47,675
This is not kumbaya, we all feel good, toxic positivity.

275
00:26:48,195 --> 00:26:49,796
This is just how we work.

276
00:26:50,116 --> 00:26:53,699
Things shut down if you are not taking care of yourself.

277
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:57,382
And that means accepting conflict.

278
00:26:58,877 --> 00:26:59,097
I know.

279
00:26:59,437 --> 00:27:00,378
Nobody likes conflict.

280
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:01,099
It's uncomfortable.

281
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:01,539
It hurts.

282
00:27:01,659 --> 00:27:02,600
It does not feel good.

283
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:17,109
But if you accept conflict as opportunity to grow, as a challenge, as a potential to make the game better, to improve your workflows and your pipelines, if you can accept a little criticism or at least a little bit of a challenge,

284
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,620
That's good.

285
00:27:18,841 --> 00:27:19,801
That's a good thing.

286
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:23,945
Some amount of friction is a good thing to make a game.

287
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:25,586
New decisions get made by that.

288
00:27:25,726 --> 00:27:30,471
Innovation gets made by conflict, but not by fights.

289
00:27:31,331 --> 00:27:35,094
So just remember, when you're approaching a conflict, it does not have to be a battle.

290
00:27:35,134 --> 00:27:36,516
It does not have to be combative.

291
00:27:37,617 --> 00:27:41,600
If you are setting good boundaries and have your sanity meter high, you'll be able to talk through it.

292
00:27:42,321 --> 00:27:43,682
And in times when you kind of mess up,

293
00:27:44,844 --> 00:27:58,695
The art of a good apology is a whole thing that you could do a GDC talk in, but I will leave you with this, because a good friend and colleague of mine, Laurie Anne Neggercy, also a producer, gave me this one time, and I have never forgot to this day.

294
00:27:59,456 --> 00:28:04,240
If you mess up, have a regrettable incident, say something personal or that you really shouldn't have,

295
00:28:05,296 --> 00:28:09,077
A good apology must pass the corpse test.

296
00:28:09,758 --> 00:28:13,399
If a corpse can do it, it's a bad apology.

297
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:18,741
If you say, I'm sorry, I'll never swear in a meeting again, that's a terrible apology.

298
00:28:18,861 --> 00:28:19,861
No one's going to believe you.

299
00:28:20,061 --> 00:28:21,141
One, it's not realistic.

300
00:28:21,221 --> 00:28:22,182
Two, a corpse can do it.

301
00:28:22,482 --> 00:28:28,464
If you say, hey, I will make a conscious effort to not use offensive language and I understand that I hurt your feelings with that.

302
00:28:28,904 --> 00:28:31,785
So yeah, the pandemic was the worst time of my depression.

303
00:28:55,293 --> 00:29:00,836
I struggled with depression off and on my entire life, and the pandemic was the magnifying glass from the sun.

304
00:29:02,117 --> 00:29:07,840
So I went back to therapy, and I've been very open about that.

305
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:21,687
And I forget, I forget sometimes that generations before us have just a huge stigma, and even our generation, our generation, I'm old, but like the most, the elder millennials in here, oh God.

306
00:29:24,534 --> 00:29:34,658
There's a stigma, and I forget that there's a stigma, but nothing busts stigma like leadership admitting that they have mental health issues and they are seeking help.

307
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:36,699
You should do it.

308
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:58,200
make a point and I and there was one a quarterly we have like these quarterly updates are our company does like a show-and-tell sort of thing at a very very high level and one quarterly I decided to say hey I'm in therapy to everybody all across all Gearbox studios and I didn't think anything of it because there's like saying hey times are hard please go get help

309
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:05,986
And I was surprised that I got so many messages like, I'm so glad you said that because not enough people talk about it.

310
00:30:06,106 --> 00:30:07,347
And it blows my mind.

311
00:30:07,367 --> 00:30:12,471
But hey, if you're like me thinking, oh, yeah, everybody's cool with mental health now and everybody's seeking therapy, it's not true.

312
00:30:13,131 --> 00:30:24,520
You probably have so many people on your team that have some sort of shame that is learned from previous generations passed down to us that it is shameful to go seek help for your mental health.

313
00:30:25,481 --> 00:30:25,841
it is not.

314
00:30:26,101 --> 00:30:28,822
So for me anyway, quick creative outlets.

315
00:30:28,882 --> 00:30:35,045
So being a creative director, you're not on the front lines anymore, you don't own specific lanes of content because you can't.

316
00:30:35,545 --> 00:30:37,766
But I love I love creating content.

317
00:30:37,786 --> 00:30:39,806
So I had to find different ways of doing that.

318
00:30:39,907 --> 00:30:44,368
So I got on tik tok I that might be weird to you.

319
00:30:44,428 --> 00:30:48,350
But there's a whole slew of elder millennials that found tik tok over the pandemic.

320
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:53,731
So I found and it was so awkward guys like it's like what do I do?

321
00:30:53,791 --> 00:31:15,058
Is this a sound and I'm doing dance trends that didn't last at all So then I did cat videos and then I like eventually landed in this like 90s nostalgia Nostalgia niche making these goofy like whatever nostalgia things that was really fun for me But it was something quick to do and I finally got that that hit of I created something I'm not checking anything in in Jira anymore, but at least I made a tick-tock and

322
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,903
But yeah, and I started creating music again.

323
00:31:23,963 --> 00:31:26,124
I'm a musician off and on, and so I like to create music.

324
00:31:26,144 --> 00:31:28,026
And so I got back into creating music.

325
00:31:28,066 --> 00:31:31,668
And again, that helped with the creation need.

326
00:31:31,788 --> 00:31:36,832
And my 12-year-old daughter found a love of baking over the pandemic.

327
00:31:36,912 --> 00:31:39,374
And so I taught her the basics of video editing.

328
00:31:39,494 --> 00:31:45,158
And then helping her create her own little baking channel was wonderful.

329
00:31:45,498 --> 00:31:45,758
for me

330
00:32:03,717 --> 00:32:04,738
and animal crossing.

331
00:32:04,858 --> 00:32:08,300
Oh man, that came out at just the right time, didn't it?

332
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:13,903
I think I poured like a thousand hours into animal crossing for like that good three months that it was out and then I just dropped it.

333
00:32:14,003 --> 00:32:15,865
I don't know, but it was such a great moment.

334
00:32:15,885 --> 00:32:20,087
But finding something that you can pour yourself into to get your mind to escape.

335
00:32:20,387 --> 00:32:27,632
And then I don't know about you, but I discovered weighted blankets over the pandemic and oh my gosh, that helped my sleep a ton.

336
00:32:29,244 --> 00:32:33,827
For me, I also am in therapy and I was open about it to the team.

337
00:32:34,288 --> 00:32:37,550
Reinforcing the idea takes more than just one voice.

338
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:44,174
And as Matt mentioned, leadership reinforcing that idea makes it feel okay for the team.

339
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:45,635
It sets a good example.

340
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:50,199
You taking care of yourself will make your teams want to take care of themselves.

341
00:32:50,939 --> 00:33:03,493
If you are someone that works your way up to leadership and you are fortunate to have the respect and admiration of anyone on your team, they're going to act like you, thinking that's how you got to where you are.

342
00:33:04,134 --> 00:33:11,822
And even if you crunched like crazy, even if you pushed yourself too hard, if you don't want them to get to where you are, if you believe that there is a better way, and there is,

343
00:33:12,723 --> 00:33:14,544
You need to walk the walk.

344
00:33:14,644 --> 00:33:16,705
You need to act like there is a better way.

345
00:33:16,845 --> 00:33:21,088
You are a leader and you need to make it okay for them to do that.

346
00:33:21,528 --> 00:33:25,710
And one of the ways Matt and I decided to do that was to be open and say, hey, therapy's cool.

347
00:33:26,351 --> 00:33:27,972
And again, nothing's implicit.

348
00:33:28,292 --> 00:33:31,594
If you don't say that, some people might not understand or believe that.

349
00:33:32,174 --> 00:33:34,275
and also it's important to work with your company.

350
00:33:34,355 --> 00:33:45,301
Gearbox Software is very good to us and we are extremely fortunate that they are supportive of therapy, that they can provide resources for us through our health insurance and through other means.

351
00:33:45,822 --> 00:33:49,684
So work with your company and leadership, find out what resources are available.

352
00:33:50,104 --> 00:33:57,368
If you can get HR to like send out a mailer, that's cool, but if you can just find out personally on the team what those things are, definitely try to do that.

353
00:33:57,608 --> 00:34:02,535
really, really helpful for folks to be able to get that information because sometimes starting is the hardest way to go about it.

354
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:14,531
So I need to get outside.

355
00:34:14,651 --> 00:34:16,852
I need to be run around like a greyhound.

356
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:21,455
And that was not as easy during the pandemic because a lot of the things that I like to do outside were social.

357
00:34:21,595 --> 00:34:27,099
So I did more long distance running away from people away from everything.

358
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:30,421
I also discovered stand up paddle boarding or stepping if you're cool.

359
00:34:32,623 --> 00:34:33,323
I am not cool.

360
00:34:33,824 --> 00:34:36,205
But it's it's a great lower impact activity.

361
00:34:36,265 --> 00:34:38,046
You can be out on a lake away from people.

362
00:34:38,267 --> 00:34:41,088
And I found a lot of good friends that way after the pandemic.

363
00:34:41,169 --> 00:34:41,729
So if you can

364
00:34:42,182 --> 00:34:50,949
If you're someone who likes nature and you can be outside and that's your happy place, definitely try out a few new things, too, if you're feeling a little bit stagnated or you break your foot.

365
00:34:53,611 --> 00:34:58,775
I also enjoy some low-key stress-reducing shows.

366
00:34:58,855 --> 00:35:04,999
I know some of the later seasons are a little problematic, but early seasons of The Great British Baking Show are my jam.

367
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,280
I go back to those.

368
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,481
I love my Mary Berry.

369
00:35:07,541 --> 00:35:08,622
She calms me down.

370
00:35:08,742 --> 00:35:09,463
It's just great.

371
00:35:10,023 --> 00:35:11,064
Chilling out stuff.

372
00:35:11,424 --> 00:35:34,720
I do not have a tick tock I am not that cool, but I can tell you there is nothing weirder than working like very closely with somebody for a long time on a project and then doom scrolling at 2 in the morning and then hearing real things people talk about in the 90s and seeing your co-workers face that is a moment All the elder millennials found tick-tock

373
00:35:36,178 --> 00:35:42,083
Another thing that sounds way less fun than anything that Matt's doing that I found that really personally helped me was delegation.

374
00:35:42,783 --> 00:35:47,146
It sounds boring, and it sounds hard, and it's icky, but it's super important.

375
00:35:47,747 --> 00:35:49,068
I took on way too much.

376
00:35:49,448 --> 00:35:56,514
I had a team of feature producers, of strike team producers, and departmental producers that all were really, really good at their jobs.

377
00:35:56,614 --> 00:35:57,955
I just didn't want to bother them.

378
00:36:00,437 --> 00:36:00,957
You guys get it.

379
00:36:02,987 --> 00:36:04,448
So it was really hard for me to delegate.

380
00:36:04,668 --> 00:36:17,814
And then I realized after reading some books on leadership and trying to level myself up that not doing that, feeling like I'm bothering my own team, actually was robbing them of the opportunity to take on new challenges and learn.

381
00:36:18,034 --> 00:36:22,576
I was doing a bad manager by not allowing my team to do some learning.

382
00:36:22,896 --> 00:36:31,560
So I had to let go of the idea that working with people was bothering them, that foisting new opportunities that I didn't like to do onto people was not rude.

383
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,301
It was not mean.

384
00:36:32,381 --> 00:36:33,841
It was delegation.

385
00:36:33,921 --> 00:36:36,043
It was helping them help themselves.

386
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:44,166
And generally speaking, if I gave someone the opportunity to learn something new, I would ask them, hey, do you have enough on your plate right now?

387
00:36:44,247 --> 00:36:45,247
Do you want to take on more?

388
00:36:45,387 --> 00:36:46,368
Have that conversation.

389
00:36:46,408 --> 00:36:48,569
Don't just give everyone their responsibilities.

390
00:36:49,549 --> 00:36:51,190
But they were actually happy to have it.

391
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,731
They're like, oh, I learned some things, and now I feel like I can level up.

392
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:56,512
Now I feel like I can promote it, or I just know more things.

393
00:36:56,612 --> 00:37:03,235
So it's really important to make sure that you are delegating for your own sanity and for the sake of your team.

394
00:37:03,275 --> 00:37:09,037
If you won't do it for yourself, because a lot of people who can't delegate won't, do it for the fact that it will help your teams.

395
00:37:09,237 --> 00:37:10,358
And it will help them advance.

396
00:37:10,438 --> 00:37:11,378
It will help them grow.

397
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:12,859
And that helps you in the long run, too.

398
00:37:13,759 --> 00:37:15,360
I also have to keep myself organized.

399
00:37:16,414 --> 00:37:23,898
I'm gonna say something truly controversial and awful, but I don't like putting my personal tasks in JIRA, which is the worst, because I make everybody else do their tasks in JIRA.

400
00:37:25,299 --> 00:37:36,444
But it's because, especially at the senior producer level, I have about a million things to do, 5,000 spinning plates, that all take less time, technically, in the day, than actually creating and closing a JIRA task.

401
00:37:36,985 --> 00:37:42,748
I am a recovering sticky notes addict and notebook addict, so I personally like Trello as a program,

402
00:37:43,168 --> 00:37:47,109
because you've got that visceral ability to move something from one category to another.

403
00:37:47,509 --> 00:37:57,751
But it's less messy than having your monitor look like a lion from all of the sticky notes on it or wondering which notebook you put that really, really important thing that you totally weren't going to forget in.

404
00:37:57,851 --> 00:38:08,454
And when you have the level of responsibility that you do as a senior project producer or any production department or any leadership department, it's really important not to forget that little tiny thing that you put in that notebook somewhere.

405
00:38:08,474 --> 00:38:10,394
So I recommend having your stuff digital.

406
00:38:10,814 --> 00:38:12,835
I also recommend having it all in one.

407
00:38:13,096 --> 00:38:13,438
place.

408
00:38:17,216 --> 00:38:20,438
The hardest thing that I had to learn was letting go.

409
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:22,799
Some of that was through delegation.

410
00:38:23,499 --> 00:38:26,261
Some of that was through harder things.

411
00:38:26,301 --> 00:38:33,185
And this is why we say whole health advocacy is not the same as just self-care, or at least what self-care has been thought to mean to become.

412
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:36,046
It is not manicures, always.

413
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:37,427
It is not a hot bubble bath.

414
00:38:37,467 --> 00:38:39,328
Although, like, if those things are your jam, go do it.

415
00:38:40,169 --> 00:38:43,691
Sometimes it's taking care of yourself in the hardest ways possible.

416
00:38:44,784 --> 00:38:50,870
during the creation of Wonderlands and during the pandemic, I realized I was in a marriage that had become toxic and wasn't working.

417
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:56,676
So part of my self-care and letting go was ending that so I could be okay.

418
00:38:57,476 --> 00:38:58,197
And that sucked.

419
00:38:58,738 --> 00:39:00,299
That was absolutely awful.

420
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:07,826
But it was the right thing for my mental health, and it made me a better leader to my team to not be distracted and hurting all the time.

421
00:39:08,487 --> 00:39:17,310
So when we say whole health advocacy, sometimes it means doing the worst feeling thing for the greater good for yourself and your team in the long run.

422
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:19,291
And sometimes that's project decisions too.

423
00:39:20,711 --> 00:39:22,012
And then of course, my pets.

424
00:39:22,232 --> 00:39:25,973
Because every time I talk about something heavy, I always add a picture of the cats.

425
00:39:26,513 --> 00:39:27,694
Just bring it on back.

426
00:39:29,414 --> 00:39:32,075
The tabby is Kirk and the tuxedo is Omen.

427
00:39:32,175 --> 00:39:33,396
I know that's important information.

428
00:39:37,557 --> 00:39:42,985
The precedent that we learned and found during the unprecedented times.

429
00:39:43,665 --> 00:39:48,953
Once we started trying to apply these lessons during development, what did we see?

430
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:53,099
What were some of these observable results?

431
00:39:54,485 --> 00:40:05,057
Well, we saw developers take the time to learn about cross-discipline departments and not just their own specific lane.

432
00:40:05,717 --> 00:40:10,983
I saw people start to learn about downstream impacts of choices that they make.

433
00:40:12,124 --> 00:40:17,909
And this understanding helped change attitudes on pushback and on limitations.

434
00:40:18,069 --> 00:40:21,792
It created empathy across disciplines.

435
00:40:22,613 --> 00:40:36,384
And one of the things that can happen when you just stick to your own lane, toxicity, it becomes a breeding ground for toxicity, especially when you have leadership that is hostile.

436
00:40:37,345 --> 00:40:41,370
Hostile leadership creates developers that go around them.

437
00:40:42,171 --> 00:40:46,936
And that breeds the worst type of toxicity.

438
00:40:48,314 --> 00:41:00,498
So empathy across disciplines, which comes from understanding what other disciplines go through in this crazy, messy thing called game development, is absolutely critical.

439
00:41:01,178 --> 00:41:03,459
The relative stress level was reduced.

440
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:05,719
And I know that's a crazy, yeah, we were in the pandemic.

441
00:41:05,739 --> 00:41:06,480
We didn't have stress.

442
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,740
That's not what this is saying.

443
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:16,963
I'm saying, in general, the stress that we create ourselves by not having empathy or understanding for our fellow developers

444
00:41:32,671 --> 00:41:33,612
Still very hard.

445
00:41:34,132 --> 00:41:36,294
Hardest thing to ship a game during the pandemic.

446
00:41:36,414 --> 00:41:43,739
But overall the types of stress and hard things we create ourselves by being in our own vacuum was reduced.

447
00:41:43,779 --> 00:41:48,343
We saw teams starting to raise red flags for people's mental health.

448
00:41:49,223 --> 00:42:02,930
and developers themselves started raising their hand and they had to go and take care of themselves or take care of their family for sometimes an extended period of time and nobody was shamed for that.

449
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:12,414
People's response and Gearbox in general, I feel very lucky to work at this company because Gearbox was already very good about a family first focus.

450
00:42:12,874 --> 00:42:16,156
But oh my gosh, did the pandemic ever put a magnifying glass on

451
00:42:16,656 --> 00:42:45,059
how important that muscle is to build being a people person focused game studio first person over product and so yeah we saw that people started feeling safer to ask for help leads and teams rallied around the common goal of shipping something great while first taking care of people

452
00:42:46,727 --> 00:42:53,321
And so that gave us the compass for leadership during very incredibly hard times.

453
00:42:55,131 --> 00:42:59,692
But of course, people-focused approach still has to ship a game.

454
00:43:00,072 --> 00:43:06,234
And people who are feeling good, that are less mentally taxed, are gonna work a little bit easier.

455
00:43:06,274 --> 00:43:08,115
It's gonna be better for them creatively.

456
00:43:08,135 --> 00:43:10,175
It's gonna be better for them physically and mentally.

457
00:43:10,215 --> 00:43:12,756
But at the end of the day, we all are here for the project.

458
00:43:13,296 --> 00:43:16,337
So how did all of this actually help the product?

459
00:43:16,377 --> 00:43:19,958
Because I know there are some people in the room that are like, yeah, people, okay, but like, bottom line.

460
00:43:20,838 --> 00:43:21,858
And in fact, it actually did.

461
00:43:21,998 --> 00:43:23,339
It really, really did.

462
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:30,704
because we had compromise as the rule, not the exception, saying no out of principle is bad.

463
00:43:30,804 --> 00:43:31,964
It just shuts people down.

464
00:43:32,425 --> 00:43:33,906
They won't want to work with you.

465
00:43:34,346 --> 00:43:40,790
And that's going to make everything feel like a fight, that every hill is one that you have to die on.

466
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:49,015
When you set compromise as part of what your production process is, people will be less likely to work around you.

467
00:43:49,095 --> 00:43:52,757
And when they really fight for something, you know it's important to them.

468
00:43:53,377 --> 00:44:00,802
Real world example is that there was a designer who was really infamous for having big ideas, not necessarily talking to the rest of the pipeline.

469
00:44:01,743 --> 00:44:04,725
And by the end of the project, this guy got it.

470
00:44:04,905 --> 00:44:13,131
He understood what the impact was, where everything was coming from, the cross-departmental chain reactions down the pipeline, the impacts that it was having.

471
00:44:13,551 --> 00:44:17,214
And very late into one of his missions, he said, Kayla, I want to make a change.

472
00:44:17,674 --> 00:44:21,196
And I went, OK, go on.

473
00:44:22,509 --> 00:44:22,829
probably

474
00:44:40,839 --> 00:44:41,339
in place.

475
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,342
I didn't have to do any of that stuff.

476
00:44:45,462 --> 00:44:47,364
I didn't have to say, well, did you talk to this person?

477
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:48,244
Did you talk to that person?

478
00:44:48,284 --> 00:44:50,226
I didn't have to run it through multiple departments.

479
00:44:50,866 --> 00:45:01,153
This individual figured it out, talked to everybody, understood the pipelines that would be impacted by his changes, and that bit of the mission became a fan favorite after.

480
00:45:01,594 --> 00:45:07,378
If I had just said no out of principle because it was late in development and I was worried about the other departments getting hit,

481
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:12,707
the world would have been robbed of that super fun moment and he would have felt like crap.

482
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:14,653
I would have felt like crap.

483
00:45:14,853 --> 00:45:16,514
Everybody would have been mad about it.

484
00:45:16,994 --> 00:45:34,006
Instead, we taught people how to talk to each other, how to talk across departments, and when he really wanted to fight for this thing that he wanted, that he believed would make the game better, and it objectively did, he went and had the conversations he needed to have, and it didn't become a hill to die on.

485
00:45:34,426 --> 00:45:38,489
It was just, this is important to me, and I figured out how to make it without hurting anyone, and we said,

486
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:39,249
Cool.

487
00:45:39,649 --> 00:45:40,170
Go ahead.

488
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:42,191
So never say no out of principle.

489
00:45:42,411 --> 00:45:44,292
You're just going to make it bad.

490
00:45:46,073 --> 00:45:52,316
And at the end of the day, truly, I believe that this was the best game that we could make.

491
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,077
All games have constraints.

492
00:45:54,617 --> 00:45:55,858
All games have challenges.

493
00:45:56,438 --> 00:46:04,943
But the overall sentiment of the team, even in the retrospective, and I asked for the retrospective around RTM, which is the spiciest time to ask for it.

494
00:46:06,207 --> 00:46:11,729
All of the problems that people had, all of the big feelings, all of the challenges, we wanted those raw and visceral.

495
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:19,772
The one thing that was consistent nearly across the board was that people were proud of the game that they made.

496
00:46:20,492 --> 00:46:22,473
And that was before any critical accolades.

497
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:24,233
That was before anything came in.

498
00:46:24,753 --> 00:46:25,774
They were just proud.

499
00:46:25,874 --> 00:46:26,894
They thought it was fun.

500
00:46:26,954 --> 00:46:35,197
And there's no better feeling for me as a leader than seeing that through all of the challenges, people came out of this still liking each other.

501
00:46:35,777 --> 00:46:38,204
and proud of the game that they made.

502
00:46:39,367 --> 00:46:44,360
And that all came from working within limitations, but also making sure that we understood one another.

503
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:53,732
Before we wrap up, what were some of the real-world challenges that required these new precedents or brought about these new habits?

504
00:46:53,972 --> 00:47:02,574
In a minute, I'll give a time where the team of Scope-Minded Creative Direction and Quality-Minded Production helped us through a really big challenge late in development.

505
00:47:03,134 --> 00:47:09,016
Kayla can first highlight where we saw whole health advocacy really hit a stride.

506
00:47:09,676 --> 00:47:10,236
Go home.

507
00:47:10,516 --> 00:47:11,797
The world is on fire.

508
00:47:13,283 --> 00:47:19,385
Most of Tiny Tina's Wonderlands was developed during the pandemic and that meant a global crisis.

509
00:47:19,405 --> 00:47:28,709
It's something that in our generations, in hundreds of years or so, we had not seen and we were not necessarily prepared for as individuals.

510
00:47:29,249 --> 00:47:29,449
talk about

511
00:47:50,268 --> 00:47:50,388
all

512
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:15,828
And we had to figure out how to still make a game, because we like having a job and eating and have roofs over our heads.

513
00:48:15,868 --> 00:48:18,070
And we were fortunate to be able to do this from home.

514
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:19,072
We are truly lucky.

515
00:48:19,592 --> 00:48:23,137
But it wasn't something that we just were prepared for.

516
00:48:23,177 --> 00:48:24,678
We didn't have a go home button yet.

517
00:48:25,672 --> 00:48:25,772
so

518
00:48:45,598 --> 00:48:45,918
support

519
00:49:09,477 --> 00:49:14,659
And we had to continue supporting the team for general messaging that it's OK to take time off.

520
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:16,159
It's OK to be overwhelmed.

521
00:49:16,259 --> 00:49:20,200
Please let us know if the scope that your ability to do has changed.

522
00:49:21,261 --> 00:49:33,404
Asking if you can do something on time versus you can do something reasonably on time is a great thing to practice as a producer, because if you're a developer who loves your game, if you're a creative, those two are very different questions.

523
00:49:33,444 --> 00:49:36,345
And that's something I had to learn actively during this pandemic.

524
00:49:37,205 --> 00:49:44,671
If you don't make time for your team's wellness and your wellness, you will have to eat time for illness.

525
00:49:45,712 --> 00:49:46,652
And that is very true.

526
00:49:46,712 --> 00:49:52,397
And you'll have to remember that even in non-pandemic times, stress is just bad for your health.

527
00:49:54,582 --> 00:49:56,263
Ah, the age-old question, is it fun yet?

528
00:49:56,724 --> 00:50:02,868
You can make all the greatest efforts to find the fun early, but game development, as we all know, is iterative.

529
00:50:02,948 --> 00:50:09,032
So deep into production, we learned our strengths and we learned these tools and how to apply it.

530
00:50:09,672 --> 00:50:19,379
The relationship of scope-minded and creative direction and quality-minded production was in a great compromising set and back and forth between departments.

531
00:50:19,739 --> 00:50:23,221
but of course we still face design challenges and late like you do.

532
00:50:24,161 --> 00:50:25,662
We got several layers of feedback.

533
00:50:25,682 --> 00:50:38,588
We have an amazing consumer research department internally and we do a lot of internal testing and so we get pages and pages of feedback and the most critical part for us and in almost any game is the first hour of the game.

534
00:50:38,688 --> 00:50:43,210
The first hour of the game wasn't connecting like we wanted it.

535
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:43,730
talk

536
00:50:59,369 --> 00:50:59,609
talk about

537
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:19,950
clearly

538
00:51:38,522 --> 00:51:50,887
We were more equipped on how to act and how to compromise, what to trade, what to not do, so that we could make the first hour of the game the best experience that it could be.

539
00:51:50,927 --> 00:51:52,947
And so the strike team meetings happened.

540
00:51:53,007 --> 00:52:02,851
We developed strike teams and re-evaluated staffing and resources so that we could make the game as good as it could be very late.

541
00:52:04,358 --> 00:52:09,720
give Matt a lot of credit because this is a very hard conversation to bring to production.

542
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:12,822
Hey, I know you've seen the feedback.

543
00:52:12,942 --> 00:52:14,523
I don't know if the game is fun yet.

544
00:52:14,983 --> 00:52:18,124
There's a really easy way to fix that, but it's going to be pretty impactful.

545
00:52:18,524 --> 00:52:22,586
That's not an easy conversation to have, and I've seen this go a lot of ways.

546
00:52:22,986 --> 00:52:24,487
I think we all have in this industry.

547
00:52:25,387 --> 00:52:28,449
Sometimes it's, I'm not going to tell production, and we're just going to work around it, or

548
00:52:29,449 --> 00:52:30,190
figure it out

549
00:52:46,912 --> 00:52:54,381
And because he came to me in that way, it was super easy to get the data we needed, to figure out what we needed to do.

550
00:52:54,421 --> 00:53:06,475
And I say easy in a relative term, but comparatively on a major pivot fairly late in development of the project, we were able to rally the team, get the Strikes teams together, and understand what we needed to do pretty quickly.

551
00:53:07,616 --> 00:53:14,899
By far one of the most important examples of how something that we learned in unprecedented times became practical.

552
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:29,846
This is a normal game development problem, but because we had been through the ringer and getting the team home and getting them healthy and keeping everyone safe, questions like this became a lot easier because we had already dealt with a lot harder big decisions.

553
00:53:30,346 --> 00:53:37,674
So this is when we say these things that we learned during these really hard times actually work for day-to-day game development problems.

554
00:53:37,794 --> 00:53:40,257
As it turns out, games still have problems.

555
00:53:40,497 --> 00:53:41,298
It's still hard.

556
00:53:41,378 --> 00:53:42,539
There are still challenges.

557
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:46,003
Matt and I are still working together, and every so often there is still friction.

558
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:50,648
But we took with us that proactive communication, empathy, and our

559
00:53:51,195 --> 00:54:02,271
production and quality mindsets to make sure that we are still making good games together and using that same mentality we had during the hard times in the easier times.

560
00:54:04,181 --> 00:54:10,064
So just as a quick recap, those skills that we developed in Crysis do work on everyday problems.

561
00:54:10,604 --> 00:54:18,188
The empathy that we built with each other for each other's work and knowing that we were both trying to make a good game spread to the team.

562
00:54:18,308 --> 00:54:21,629
The team empathy that we have continues to this day.

563
00:54:21,669 --> 00:54:26,692
We still actually work with a lot of the same people, so it's important not to make a lot of enemies at the end of the game.

564
00:54:28,112 --> 00:54:32,516
And that's just something that we learned and we really enjoy working together with.

565
00:54:33,396 --> 00:54:37,719
And there's still a better understanding of limitations across discipline.

566
00:54:37,779 --> 00:54:46,726
We still see, even with colleagues that we're no longer working with on the same project, more of those ideas coming up, more hands being raised in managing directors.

567
00:54:47,146 --> 00:54:49,927
when they say, hey, I think there's a problem here, which is great to see.

568
00:54:50,707 --> 00:54:52,628
We've got that creative and scope mindset.

569
00:54:53,148 --> 00:54:54,868
Production is flexible for change.

570
00:54:55,269 --> 00:55:01,491
Design is flexible in changing their new plans to fit within the hard limitations of productions.

571
00:55:01,571 --> 00:55:12,394
Our powers combined, we can make magical things happen, and we can make a chaotic great game, trademark, and we can still do it without putting too much pressure on the team.

572
00:55:13,669 --> 00:55:16,394
Compromising before fighting, that's the mindset.

573
00:55:16,434 --> 00:55:25,151
You can fight for the things that you want, you can fight for your ideas, but be willing to compromise because the magic is probably somewhere in the middle of between what you want and what your colleagues want.

574
00:55:26,035 --> 00:55:32,022
And again, that whole health advocacy, this is not a song we just sing to say that we did.

575
00:55:32,142 --> 00:55:35,826
It's something that we both take very seriously and want to impart on our team.

576
00:55:36,647 --> 00:55:40,671
Person first response, your people are required to make the project.

577
00:55:40,731 --> 00:55:42,613
You cannot make a project without people.

578
00:55:42,734 --> 00:55:45,296
Even if it's just you, you need to take care of your only people.

579
00:55:45,837 --> 00:55:47,158
You do not pass the bus test.

580
00:55:48,134 --> 00:55:50,135
Please take care of yourselves and each other.

581
00:55:50,355 --> 00:55:51,415
That makes a better game.

582
00:55:51,455 --> 00:55:56,497
That makes a more creative game and it makes a less toxic work environment for everyone around you.

583
00:55:57,358 --> 00:56:00,399
And also that requires trusting open communication.

584
00:56:00,859 --> 00:56:02,000
Be there for your team.

585
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:03,480
Follow through.

586
00:56:03,921 --> 00:56:06,402
If you do not follow through, you will lose that trust.

587
00:56:06,442 --> 00:56:09,263
They'll just assume you're saying things because you are just saying things.

588
00:56:10,043 --> 00:56:13,486
Be ready to act on whatever you promise.

589
00:56:13,666 --> 00:56:19,291
If you lose that trust, I cannot stress this enough, it will take you 10 times longer to get it back.

590
00:56:20,172 --> 00:56:22,975
Trust that your team understands what they're talking about.

591
00:56:23,035 --> 00:56:27,238
Trust your subject matter experts and they'll trust you to guide them as a producer.

592
00:56:30,021 --> 00:56:30,802
Any closing thoughts?

593
00:56:34,245 --> 00:56:34,405
No.

594
00:56:36,587 --> 00:56:37,310
You did wonderful.

595
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:39,757
All right, we have a few minutes left for Q&A.

596
00:56:39,998 --> 00:56:40,399
Oh, thank you.

597
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:40,841
Thank you

598
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:02,403
across different subject disciplines.

599
00:57:03,104 --> 00:57:08,788
Was that sufficient to changing the team's mind around more constraint-focused direction, or was there more to that process?

600
00:57:09,408 --> 00:57:13,150
I think the constraint-focused direction is something that's more, like, innate in me.

601
00:57:13,431 --> 00:57:19,675
And it wasn't necessarily something Gearbox is not necessarily used to.

602
00:57:19,735 --> 00:57:21,196
It's just something that's innate in me.

603
00:57:21,256 --> 00:57:24,618
But as far as, like, a whole sea change, like,

604
00:57:25,779 --> 00:57:25,879
It's

605
00:57:46,873 --> 00:57:46,993
it's

606
00:58:02,225 --> 00:58:09,674
You don't follow through, if it just doesn't work, if it ends up being worse on the team than it was, like, not working in that way, you're gonna lose everybody.

607
00:58:09,954 --> 00:58:14,840
If people start to see it working, even some of your toughest critics will become good adopters.

608
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:17,863
And I definitely recommend appealing to your toughest critics.

609
00:58:17,923 --> 00:58:20,627
If you can get them to adopt, more people will follow.

610
00:58:23,002 --> 00:58:29,988
So first, thank you very, very much for an extremely validating and nourishing talk on design and production leadership.

611
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:39,917
The content that you produced today, although it was largely about production and design leadership, was sort of a cultural manifesto.

612
00:58:40,717 --> 00:58:44,741
So I'm going to ask a question sort of tongue-in-cheek, and I want you to read between the lines a little bit.

613
00:58:45,662 --> 00:58:48,224
Whose job is it to create a cultural manifesto?

614
00:58:49,861 --> 00:58:51,222
leadership in the industry.

615
00:58:52,423 --> 00:58:55,285
I know it's tongue in cheek, but I believe this from the top down.

616
00:58:55,385 --> 00:59:02,511
And when I say that we are very fortunate at Gearbox to have that autonomy that we have, it's because we are supported by leadership.

617
00:59:03,752 --> 00:59:05,113
And that's really important.

618
00:59:05,153 --> 00:59:11,298
So they allow us to just do what we need to do, make sure that it's working well, and they don't ask too many questions.

619
00:59:11,698 --> 00:59:12,939
And we're almost out.

620
00:59:12,959 --> 00:59:16,041
But we will have the speaker lounge staying after this.

621
00:59:16,742 --> 00:59:17,382
Are we done?

622
00:59:17,582 --> 00:59:19,344
Or do we still have time for more?

623
00:59:20,117 --> 00:59:48,449
