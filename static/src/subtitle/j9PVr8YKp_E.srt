1
00:00:05,512 --> 00:00:11,276
Hi everybody, welcome to my talk. I'm very excited to be here. I want to talk today about a few things.

2
00:00:11,696 --> 00:00:16,319
Firstly, for beginners or those who want to start adventuring games as VFX artists,

3
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,364
I wanted to talk about my mistakes, about my failures, how I started and how I got here.

4
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:28,849
And then for veterans and really for everybody, I want to talk about how I kept growing and stay

5
00:00:28,869 --> 00:00:31,471
motivated and passionate like on the first day of my job.

6
00:00:32,211 --> 00:00:34,373
And I also have some practical examples for you.

7
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:37,476
What we'd like to achieve in this talk

8
00:00:37,776 --> 00:00:39,398
is to inspire curiosity in you

9
00:00:39,838 --> 00:00:43,181
about all wonderful things you can find and learn

10
00:00:43,602 --> 00:00:46,825
and how this can be applicable to your career and your job.

11
00:00:47,325 --> 00:00:50,248
And I would also like to spark passion

12
00:00:50,368 --> 00:00:51,369
and love for what you do.

13
00:00:52,688 --> 00:01:02,915
Few words about myself. I'm an FX artist with 15 years of experience in games and currently I'm working at id Software on Doom Eternal as a Lead VFX Artist.

14
00:01:03,215 --> 00:01:06,817
And I have a short video from previous Doom, Doom 2016 of my work.

15
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:25,151
I'm also a big fan of tiny potato meme from Emily's Diary.

16
00:02:25,751 --> 00:02:29,454
So this tiny potato will accompany us through the presentation.

17
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:35,099
I was born in Poland, country of potatoes, cabbage, and a lot of other good food.

18
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:37,681
And as a child, I didn't have Barbies or Legos,

19
00:02:38,081 --> 00:02:40,303
but I have had crayons and colored pencils.

20
00:02:40,543 --> 00:02:41,824
And this is what I've been playing with.

21
00:02:42,364 --> 00:02:47,708
I was drawing flowers, horses, and I loved drawing explosions.

22
00:02:49,513 --> 00:02:53,315
I got my first PC at 17 and I spent my life savings on it.

23
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,075
And I was blown away by creative freedom in CG.

24
00:02:56,516 --> 00:02:58,336
At the time, it seemed to me limitless.

25
00:02:58,876 --> 00:03:00,497
And I created my first website.

26
00:03:00,877 --> 00:03:04,658
I worked on my first 2D game and first racing 3D game

27
00:03:04,778 --> 00:03:05,438
back in Poland.

28
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,161
And I quickly realized that to get access

29
00:03:09,181 --> 00:03:11,403
to all the knowledge, I have to learn English.

30
00:03:12,004 --> 00:03:14,046
And there was no online tutorials

31
00:03:14,126 --> 00:03:15,847
and or internet as we know it now.

32
00:03:16,368 --> 00:03:18,630
So the books were the only source of knowledge for me

33
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,011
and they all were in English.

34
00:03:20,552 --> 00:03:23,755
This is one of my favorite and first book I got

35
00:03:23,775 --> 00:03:25,696
for myself about VFX,

36
00:03:25,717 --> 00:03:28,079
Deconstructing the Elements by Pete Draper.

37
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,821
And to do all the tutorials in this book,

38
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:33,482
I had to get myself a dictionary,

39
00:03:33,862 --> 00:03:36,443
and this is how I went, this is how it started.

40
00:03:37,104 --> 00:03:38,824
And there are some other books I recommend

41
00:03:38,905 --> 00:03:42,206
for anybody who is or want to be a VFX artist.

42
00:03:44,802 --> 00:03:47,666
My parents didn't want me to be a poor artist, generally,

43
00:03:47,726 --> 00:03:48,987
so they didn't like that idea.

44
00:03:49,348 --> 00:03:51,150
So they sent me to a college that

45
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,153
was miles away from my house to become

46
00:03:54,173 --> 00:03:57,176
a master engineer of environment protection science.

47
00:03:58,058 --> 00:04:00,781
But commuting time was three hours one way,

48
00:04:01,161 --> 00:04:03,724
and that meant six hours a day I was sitting on a train.

49
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:09,288
And I thought I could do so many cool things on my new computer if I only have time for that.

50
00:04:09,768 --> 00:04:13,391
So after a year I transferred to a different college to save on time.

51
00:04:14,211 --> 00:04:18,894
And I studied material science instead.

52
00:04:19,775 --> 00:04:22,096
My parents didn't know about it because they were working shifts,

53
00:04:22,176 --> 00:04:25,438
so they didn't realize that I've been coming home a little bit earlier.

54
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,902
And soon I started contracting and earning some money.

55
00:04:30,962 --> 00:04:33,764
So I was thinking maybe I should drop off to school completely.

56
00:04:34,824 --> 00:04:38,207
But I didn't, and I'm glad I didn't because later on,

57
00:04:38,587 --> 00:04:41,849
higher education proved to be invaluable for immigration.

58
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,651
Everywhere I went, starting with England,

59
00:04:44,892 --> 00:04:47,473
Singapore, Canada, and United States,

60
00:04:47,894 --> 00:04:50,195
higher education was pretty much requirement

61
00:04:50,255 --> 00:04:52,317
for me to get job and live in those countries.

62
00:04:53,284 --> 00:04:58,846
Additionally, I convinced all my professors that I can do very good quality visualization

63
00:04:59,026 --> 00:05:05,149
of burning process in industrial stove and they agreed for me this to be a big part of

64
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:08,030
my master thesis, which was a lot of fun to do actually.

65
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:15,062
Next day, after my master's thesis degree, I flew to England for my first series interview

66
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:17,504
for 3D generalist position.

67
00:05:17,924 --> 00:05:18,945
And I had my demo reel.

68
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:23,567
But in my demo reel, I didn't have any of my contract work at the end in Poland or even

69
00:05:23,627 --> 00:05:24,468
my master's thesis.

70
00:05:25,128 --> 00:05:27,349
I worked on a personal project for a while.

71
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:31,250
I thought that was the better piece of art of anything else at the time I had.

72
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:35,971
And I thought I had so much fun working on it because there was no restrictions on it.

73
00:05:36,351 --> 00:05:39,792
Nobody told me there was a deadline, there was no art direction,

74
00:05:40,092 --> 00:05:44,574
there was no performance limitations or strange tools.

75
00:05:44,914 --> 00:05:45,634
So it was great.

76
00:05:46,594 --> 00:05:51,175
And at the same time, I was learning English very hard for a few months to prepare for that interview.

77
00:05:51,616 --> 00:05:53,236
But it didn't go well.

78
00:05:53,756 --> 00:05:58,058
It went actually quite bumpy because I got so stressed, I completely froze,

79
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:00,238
I couldn't say a word on that interview.

80
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:04,399
And fortunately, my demo reel saved me and I still got hired.

81
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,542
And with that company, I shipped my first AAA title

82
00:06:11,002 --> 00:06:13,603
and from there, my doors were opening everywhere for me.

83
00:06:14,464 --> 00:06:16,745
Of course, it wasn't as simple as that.

84
00:06:17,225 --> 00:06:19,826
It was a lot of stress because I was still struggling

85
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:22,327
with English, learning new tools,

86
00:06:22,387 --> 00:06:23,748
proprietary tools and Maya.

87
00:06:24,328 --> 00:06:27,169
And I felt like an idiot asking everybody for questions.

88
00:06:27,809 --> 00:06:30,951
And giving and receiving feedback was terrifying

89
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:33,672
because all artists were more experienced than me

90
00:06:33,832 --> 00:06:34,993
and they were all better than me.

91
00:06:35,753 --> 00:06:39,716
And the only thing now, when I'm looking at it from perspective,

92
00:06:39,836 --> 00:06:44,659
I know that I was stressed because I was learning and growing.

93
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:46,600
And that's the process.

94
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:52,049
So first I was hired to be a 3D generalist,

95
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:56,014
but of all the things I most wanted to make VFX.

96
00:06:56,034 --> 00:06:58,497
So I learned particle flow, fume effects,

97
00:06:58,557 --> 00:06:59,898
fluids in Maya, Krakatoa,

98
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,822
thinking particles reflow, you name it.

99
00:07:02,942 --> 00:07:05,064
I did tons of training for film and CG

100
00:07:05,104 --> 00:07:07,307
because there was not much training for VFX

101
00:07:07,367 --> 00:07:08,468
for games at the time.

102
00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:13,410
And I was wondering how far I can push real-time VFX

103
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,111
to look better, to look like in film, to look amazing.

104
00:07:17,592 --> 00:07:21,573
And I realized that one of the things I have control over,

105
00:07:21,653 --> 00:07:24,514
regardless what set of tools I'm using, is the texture.

106
00:07:25,934 --> 00:07:28,115
Especially if it's animated flipbook texture.

107
00:07:29,195 --> 00:07:32,716
When everybody else was using real footage to create animated flipbooks,

108
00:07:33,157 --> 00:07:37,298
I was rendering textures from real flow and fume effects simulations.

109
00:07:37,798 --> 00:07:40,058
I thought they are art directable and unique,

110
00:07:40,218 --> 00:07:44,420
so no other game would have the same fire as game I'm working on, which was great.

111
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,140
I thought they are high quality, noise-free.

112
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:51,861
I could render easily alpha mask or any other mask and maps.

113
00:07:52,682 --> 00:07:57,689
And it was much easier to retime if I needed them

114
00:07:57,749 --> 00:08:01,254
to have more or less frames to play slow motion or faster.

115
00:08:01,735 --> 00:08:03,578
So I had a huge success with that.

116
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:07,483
And then one day I got a dream job.

117
00:08:08,224 --> 00:08:10,246
Congratulations, and now what?

118
00:08:11,046 --> 00:08:14,729
So I was finally hired for a senior VFX artist

119
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:16,310
for amazing AAA title.

120
00:08:16,911 --> 00:08:20,293
I was excited, happy, and the world

121
00:08:20,353 --> 00:08:21,774
was just amazing at the time.

122
00:08:22,695 --> 00:08:24,036
Because I got used to the pressure

123
00:08:24,076 --> 00:08:25,357
and fast-paced development,

124
00:08:25,877 --> 00:08:27,018
So I was pretty happy.

125
00:08:27,278 --> 00:08:29,360
But then with time, with couple of years,

126
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,721
especially during downtime, I got bored.

127
00:08:32,182 --> 00:08:33,903
And I grew more restless and frustrated.

128
00:08:34,143 --> 00:08:37,225
I was just thinking, I can't just make particles all the time.

129
00:08:37,245 --> 00:08:39,006
It's kind of boring.

130
00:08:39,026 --> 00:08:39,927
I'm kind of done with it.

131
00:08:40,507 --> 00:08:42,028
And I felt like I needed a challenge,

132
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,790
but I didn't want to quit my job.

133
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:48,053
So what I did, I took part in some CG competitions,

134
00:08:48,113 --> 00:08:50,295
started doing more personal projects again,

135
00:08:50,956 --> 00:08:53,178
and I learned new skills and software.

136
00:08:53,498 --> 00:08:55,540
And I also connected with other artists.

137
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,542
And all that combined, meeting new people,

138
00:08:58,642 --> 00:09:00,824
learning new software, and starting new projects,

139
00:09:01,385 --> 00:09:03,967
it felt exactly like starting a new job,

140
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:07,210
but without quitting the old one, which was fantastic.

141
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:11,451
But then, at some point, I also took it too far.

142
00:09:12,111 --> 00:09:15,912
I shipped three AAA titles in three years.

143
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,272
That was great for my portfolio,

144
00:09:18,612 --> 00:09:21,253
but not good for my health and passion for games.

145
00:09:22,173 --> 00:09:24,213
I still wanted to do more, but I couldn't.

146
00:09:25,093 --> 00:09:26,694
Looks like too much of anything,

147
00:09:26,894 --> 00:09:29,354
even a good thing, can be a bad thing.

148
00:09:29,714 --> 00:09:31,054
This is why I wanted to talk

149
00:09:31,455 --> 00:09:33,435
about passion, workaholics, and burnout,

150
00:09:33,975 --> 00:09:35,295
and how can they be related.

151
00:09:36,195 --> 00:09:40,618
Firstly, passion is treated very seriously in games.

152
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:43,340
It's part of the job description.

153
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,502
I look closer at what it actually means.

154
00:09:46,842 --> 00:09:50,525
And from many definitions from the internet, I pull just two, just for contrast.

155
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:55,988
Something that you are strongly interested in and enjoy sounds like a pleasant thing,

156
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:59,570
but then strong and barely controllable emotion,

157
00:10:00,071 --> 00:10:02,652
every day, all the time, is probably not the healthiest thing.

158
00:10:03,656 --> 00:10:05,478
And from my experience, there's no really

159
00:10:05,518 --> 00:10:06,800
boundary between the two.

160
00:10:07,301 --> 00:10:09,924
And one can turn into the other at any time.

161
00:10:09,944 --> 00:10:12,127
So some better metaphors.

162
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,034
Passion is a powerful driving force.

163
00:10:15,274 --> 00:10:16,715
It can spark a fire in you

164
00:10:17,035 --> 00:10:19,817
that's often difficult to extinguish by sweat or battle.

165
00:10:20,377 --> 00:10:22,138
And passion is like ocean.

166
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:24,100
It can take you far places,

167
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,901
but it can also drown you if you don't respect it.

168
00:10:27,101 --> 00:10:28,082
And I made that one up.

169
00:10:28,602 --> 00:10:29,543
But the point is,

170
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:34,966
the point is that passion can be like a double-edged sword.

171
00:10:35,226 --> 00:10:36,727
It can help and it can hurt.

172
00:10:37,187 --> 00:10:38,288
So how do I deal with it?

173
00:10:39,182 --> 00:10:45,606
I'm trying to be careful how I fuel my passion and it's like a hobby so I would invest money

174
00:10:45,727 --> 00:10:50,710
and time in it but I wouldn't invest all the money all the time because that would turn

175
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:56,595
into obsession and I need to know when to stop in time to always get back to it excited

176
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:58,836
the next day, not be tired and bored of it.

177
00:10:59,978 --> 00:11:02,822
I used Pomodoro technique to know when to take breaks from work,

178
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:08,690
and I remember that work in the entertainment industry is supposed to be fun,

179
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:12,816
because if we don't have fun making games, then players will not enjoy playing them.

180
00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:20,920
I think back to the time when I started and what was exciting about my job back then,

181
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,701
because I feel still the same way about my job now.

182
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:26,921
And I focus on what's important.

183
00:11:27,301 --> 00:11:30,282
Of course, this is much easier from manager perspective,

184
00:11:30,342 --> 00:11:32,062
because I see now the bigger picture.

185
00:11:32,722 --> 00:11:38,104
And I prioritise and let go and come to terms with the fact that artists never finish,

186
00:11:38,244 --> 00:11:40,064
just abandon when we run out of time.

187
00:11:40,984 --> 00:11:42,705
I try to work smarter, not harder.

188
00:11:43,205 --> 00:11:47,806
I'm trying to use all the knowledge, tools, and ask others for help if this is what makes

189
00:11:47,886 --> 00:11:49,047
my job more efficient.

190
00:11:49,787 --> 00:11:52,708
And part of this efficiency are procedural workflows.

191
00:11:53,048 --> 00:11:56,029
And this is when I heard about Houdini many, many years ago.

192
00:11:56,469 --> 00:12:01,510
But I started to learn Houdini just a couple of years ago just because it is very hard.

193
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:06,572
Most of you probably know this picture and think it's a great joke, but it's not.

194
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:07,132
It's true.

195
00:12:07,512 --> 00:12:07,992
It's hard.

196
00:12:09,393 --> 00:12:16,076
I also had to justify spending on expensive PC and I thought about it as investment in my passion and career

197
00:12:16,677 --> 00:12:20,779
and honestly I wouldn't be here if I didn't get that PC couple of years ago.

198
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:26,002
Harder though, hardest though was finding time in busy day to day living

199
00:12:26,522 --> 00:12:29,924
and I started learning Houdini in the evenings after work and on weekends.

200
00:12:30,744 --> 00:12:33,306
And then I was looking for good sources of information.

201
00:12:33,626 --> 00:12:35,647
I started by joining side effects forums,

202
00:12:35,928 --> 00:12:39,230
odd forums, and various Houdini Facebook groups.

203
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:42,572
And from there, I found tons of information,

204
00:12:42,712 --> 00:12:44,293
learning resources, and tutorials.

205
00:12:44,793 --> 00:12:46,695
But the best tutorials for me are those

206
00:12:47,135 --> 00:12:48,216
that are easy to follow,

207
00:12:48,356 --> 00:12:50,497
and they don't take eight hours to complete.

208
00:12:51,398 --> 00:12:52,378
And there are a few examples.

209
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:53,739
Antagma, Steven Knipping,

210
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,540
Jon Farmfield, Houdini Wiki.

211
00:12:57,101 --> 00:12:59,103
And people now ask me quite often,

212
00:12:59,503 --> 00:13:02,226
where do you start, what tutorials do I begin with

213
00:13:02,326 --> 00:13:03,287
if I wanna learn Houdini?

214
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,149
And I do send them those tutorials,

215
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:07,071
at least from the previous slide.

216
00:13:07,512 --> 00:13:09,193
And some of those people do come back to me

217
00:13:09,273 --> 00:13:12,497
after a couple of months with rendered images

218
00:13:12,697 --> 00:13:15,480
from those tutorials showing that they follow the tutorials.

219
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,101
And that's a good start, but this is not where I would stop.

220
00:13:20,761 --> 00:13:25,643
Personally, when I learn, I need to apply the idea from a tutorial

221
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,583
to some different concept, to a different scene,

222
00:13:29,203 --> 00:13:33,524
or combine a few ideas into another completely unique scene.

223
00:13:33,925 --> 00:13:37,265
And that way, I'm sure it's something I can take also credit for.

224
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:40,426
But also, it's good to take the same tutorial

225
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:44,827
and take it further, add to it, plus it, change it a little bit.

226
00:13:46,184 --> 00:13:48,325
So this is one of the examples I have here

227
00:13:48,685 --> 00:13:50,145
for taking a tutorial through.

228
00:13:50,445 --> 00:13:53,746
And I started with this simple tutorial from Antagma.

229
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,486
It takes about five, 10 minutes.

230
00:13:55,506 --> 00:14:00,727
It's on Antagma Patreon from their VEX 101 series.

231
00:14:01,348 --> 00:14:04,648
And as a result, you get a lot of boxes that spin,

232
00:14:05,048 --> 00:14:08,269
and as they spin, they create a nice wavy motion.

233
00:14:08,869 --> 00:14:11,270
So I thought, how can I plus it?

234
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,750
What else I can do with this?

235
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,611
So I added another layer of noise on this.

236
00:14:16,471 --> 00:14:18,834
and that already made the pattern more interesting.

237
00:14:19,354 --> 00:14:21,156
And then I thought, I don't want all my boxes

238
00:14:21,216 --> 00:14:22,318
to have the same color.

239
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:25,801
I would like some boxes to be brighter, more glowy,

240
00:14:26,522 --> 00:14:31,407
depending on, like here, depending on angle of the box

241
00:14:31,547 --> 00:14:35,852
and on the velocity, spin velocity.

242
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:40,252
So at that point, I changed the color of the boxes

243
00:14:40,993 --> 00:14:43,255
and I did a test render and I realized

244
00:14:43,275 --> 00:14:45,877
it would be cool to have some additional smoke swirling

245
00:14:46,378 --> 00:14:47,379
around those boxes.

246
00:14:48,219 --> 00:14:52,643
And so I sourced smoke from the floor from under the boxes

247
00:14:52,884 --> 00:14:55,586
and I sourced velocity from the boxes themselves

248
00:14:56,427 --> 00:14:58,569
and I simulated pretty standard simulation

249
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:01,131
in the Houdini dynamic operators.

250
00:15:02,272 --> 00:15:05,714
And from there, I did another test render

251
00:15:05,934 --> 00:15:08,716
and I realized that my nice glowing bright boxes

252
00:15:08,816 --> 00:15:11,658
are covered by dark smoke, which wasn't that great.

253
00:15:11,898 --> 00:15:14,520
So I wanted to make the smoke brighter

254
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,881
where the boxes were brighter.

255
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:18,102
But I didn't want to resimulate the whole thing.

256
00:15:18,703 --> 00:15:20,704
So what I did, I scattered a bunch of points

257
00:15:20,784 --> 00:15:21,524
around the boxes.

258
00:15:22,405 --> 00:15:27,532
and I transferred, I made volume from attribute

259
00:15:27,972 --> 00:15:32,438
to get the density where the points were red.

260
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:35,162
And then I multiplied this new created volume

261
00:15:35,222 --> 00:15:37,585
with the volume from previously simulated DOP.

262
00:15:38,506 --> 00:15:43,728
And that gave me the same smoke but only in areas where boxes were bright and I renamed it to be

263
00:15:43,808 --> 00:15:49,791
heat. That way I could shade it as a fire and the smoke from the simulation I could shade,

264
00:15:50,631 --> 00:15:54,753
density from the simulation I could shade as a smoke and that way I achieved the effect I wanted.

265
00:15:55,733 --> 00:15:59,336
On the boxes I had the material that as I mentioned,

266
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,898
the red color was controlling the emissive

267
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:03,560
and blue color diffuse,

268
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,262
and the material was reflective, refractive,

269
00:16:06,302 --> 00:16:07,303
had round corners,

270
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,906
and I rendered the whole thing in 4K in Redshift.

271
00:16:11,226 --> 00:16:13,448
That was one of my first renders in Redshift

272
00:16:13,568 --> 00:16:16,210
and I was very surprised how much harder

273
00:16:16,271 --> 00:16:18,893
it is rendering in 4K than HD.

274
00:16:18,913 --> 00:16:20,634
It was very interesting experience.

275
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:24,478
And I added crazy soundtrack by Tiny Cat Massage

276
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:26,640
and that was the final result.

277
00:16:43,405 --> 00:16:49,149
So that was one of the first videos where we thought that the music matches with visuals very well.

278
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:54,833
And after that we wanted to take it further with visuals and sound integration,

279
00:16:55,413 --> 00:17:01,797
where we wanted the visuals, animation or particles to be completely audio-reactive, triggered by sound.

280
00:17:02,698 --> 00:17:08,061
So I started by looking at this tutorial by Atom on Vimeo.

281
00:17:08,922 --> 00:17:13,245
He has a sphere and a box moving to a tune,

282
00:17:14,046 --> 00:17:17,789
and he shows how to use chops, channel operators,

283
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:22,593
course to modify them, to make them usable for animation,

284
00:17:22,673 --> 00:17:23,493
and this is the reason we get.

285
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:35,491
And then I also really like the technique by Spencer Lauders

286
00:17:36,152 --> 00:17:39,577
from CG Workshops, Introduction to Effects Using Houdini.

287
00:17:40,278 --> 00:17:43,662
He shows how to dissolve an object into particles.

288
00:17:44,003 --> 00:17:45,805
It's a very cool technique he shows.

289
00:17:47,665 --> 00:17:50,528
So I wanted to combine those two and make something unique.

290
00:17:51,268 --> 00:17:54,931
And what I changed here, I used MIDI instead of WAV files

291
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,233
because I wanted to have access to separate nodes.

292
00:17:57,733 --> 00:17:59,655
I wanted more nodes, not just one or two,

293
00:17:59,715 --> 00:18:01,116
but I want to have five or six.

294
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,358
And I created separate emitter for each node

295
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:06,940
and I spawned a particle from relevant emitter

296
00:18:06,981 --> 00:18:08,121
when node was happening.

297
00:18:08,702 --> 00:18:11,284
And I copy a sphere to each particle

298
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,165
and the size of the sphere was relevant

299
00:18:13,185 --> 00:18:14,426
to the amplitude of the node.

300
00:18:15,247 --> 00:18:18,149
And this is how it would look like at the start.

301
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:24,833
And then I created second particle operator network,

302
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:27,795
second pop network to dissolve spheres on collision.

303
00:18:27,855 --> 00:18:30,677
And that part is exactly like in Spencer's tutorial.

304
00:18:31,337 --> 00:18:34,680
And I'm just adding some additional velocity,

305
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,241
custom velocity for particles so they go up

306
00:18:38,042 --> 00:18:39,863
and above the floor, not under the floor.

307
00:18:39,943 --> 00:18:40,884
But this is the final result.

308
00:18:59,786 --> 00:19:05,831
So this is all going great, but I had to do some adjustments with my working routine,

309
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:12,598
because it was very frustrating to walk away from a problem very late at night, and my

310
00:19:12,858 --> 00:19:15,921
head was still spinning to try to solve the problem in Houdini when I was supposed to

311
00:19:15,961 --> 00:19:17,262
be asleep a long time ago.

312
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:23,347
So I had to limit learning Houdini to every second evening and only part-time weekends.

313
00:19:24,048 --> 00:19:27,170
But I did save tons of time on rendering,

314
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,372
because we do have two computers at home,

315
00:19:29,672 --> 00:19:32,374
and my husband's computer is never used at night.

316
00:19:32,654 --> 00:19:34,836
So we start rendering every second frame

317
00:19:34,896 --> 00:19:35,857
to our network drive.

318
00:19:36,337 --> 00:19:39,880
The only problem we had was that we were drawing too much power

319
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,402
from our office room, so computers

320
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:43,663
were randomly shutting down.

321
00:19:44,123 --> 00:19:44,704
This is why.

322
00:19:46,421 --> 00:19:50,886
This is why we had to get this really nice, thick, long, yellow cable

323
00:19:51,287 --> 00:19:55,291
to draw power from another room and after that it was working perfectly fine.

324
00:19:58,495 --> 00:20:02,660
And on the evenings when I was not working on Houdini, I started painting

325
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,964
and that actually proved to be a much more relaxing activity before going to bed.

326
00:20:08,743 --> 00:20:10,404
So where do I take the ideas from?

327
00:20:10,904 --> 00:20:12,085
Really, sky's the limit.

328
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:15,446
Anything, ArtStation, Instagram, Pinterest, Dreams, Films.

329
00:20:16,187 --> 00:20:18,328
And I keep a list of ideas to pull from.

330
00:20:19,028 --> 00:20:20,349
I start with a simple idea

331
00:20:20,489 --> 00:20:22,290
because if the idea is too complex,

332
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,711
it's less likely to,

333
00:20:24,931 --> 00:20:26,491
project is less likely to be finished

334
00:20:26,711 --> 00:20:29,353
and the message is less likely to be conveyed for viewer.

335
00:20:31,294 --> 00:20:33,016
But I don't start with the first idea

336
00:20:33,096 --> 00:20:35,658
because the first idea is usually the most boring one

337
00:20:36,018 --> 00:20:39,261
so I try to add to it, plus it,

338
00:20:39,722 --> 00:20:41,163
twist it, change it a little bit.

339
00:20:41,643 --> 00:20:43,505
And sometimes I even try to tell a story.

340
00:20:43,945 --> 00:20:45,126
And of course there's a question,

341
00:20:45,367 --> 00:20:47,929
do you need to model, rig, animate,

342
00:20:48,369 --> 00:20:51,132
and make all those assets to make actually like a scene,

343
00:20:51,232 --> 00:20:52,973
especially if it's like a storytelling?

344
00:20:53,554 --> 00:20:54,775
And the answer is not always.

345
00:20:55,115 --> 00:20:56,496
I looked what other artists do,

346
00:20:56,776 --> 00:20:59,818
and this is one of my favorite artists, Render Burger.

347
00:20:59,838 --> 00:21:01,279
You can find him on Instagram,

348
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,441
and he does a lot of cool videos.

349
00:21:04,102 --> 00:21:05,623
And this little animation,

350
00:21:05,903 --> 00:21:08,545
model and animation surely are procedural,

351
00:21:09,145 --> 00:21:11,067
and it's a nice little idea.

352
00:21:12,174 --> 00:21:16,700
You can also get free models from freediscounts.com

353
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,003
and that's just one of the websites where you can get them.

354
00:21:19,063 --> 00:21:21,586
This is where I got this little dragon from.

355
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:26,192
And yeah, the quality of those models is really, really good.

356
00:21:26,232 --> 00:21:27,234
You can do a lot with them.

357
00:21:29,156 --> 00:21:31,358
And you can also buy very, very cheap models,

358
00:21:31,438 --> 00:21:34,982
I mean, sometimes five, $10 from CGTrader or Unity.

359
00:21:35,422 --> 00:21:38,005
Many times they come animated, rigged animated,

360
00:21:38,626 --> 00:21:41,468
and I don't exactly know where Render Burger

361
00:21:41,528 --> 00:21:45,332
took this head model from, but the point is not

362
00:21:45,693 --> 00:21:47,695
about the head, the point is about the idea

363
00:21:47,795 --> 00:21:50,057
and caption, which is mind-blowing.

364
00:21:51,967 --> 00:22:01,107
And also, if you know people who want to upgrade their skills as animators or modelers, it's a very good idea to team up.

365
00:22:03,754 --> 00:22:08,398
So when working on a project, I implement ideas fast to see what has potential.

366
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:13,364
And I move to the next concept if something doesn't spark or if it's technically too hard.

367
00:22:14,365 --> 00:22:20,031
If I can't get it done because I'm discouraged in any way or it goes too slow, I might stop.

368
00:22:20,451 --> 00:22:22,974
And the point is to keep going, keep progressing.

369
00:22:24,295 --> 00:22:27,801
So, for example, this shot I made just in a couple of days,

370
00:22:27,882 --> 00:22:31,027
because the previous idea I've been working on for weeks

371
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:33,291
was just technically too hard.

372
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:36,096
And I might come back to it at some point when I know more about it.

373
00:22:38,276 --> 00:22:40,036
So how do I know when the project is finished

374
00:22:40,196 --> 00:22:42,237
if no one tells me when is the deadline?

375
00:22:43,017 --> 00:22:44,818
I'm trying to focus on what's important.

376
00:22:45,638 --> 00:22:48,818
I fix only five to 10 things from my first test render

377
00:22:49,479 --> 00:22:51,679
and I'm trying to finish one project a month.

378
00:22:52,139 --> 00:22:53,920
If I can't deliver something clever

379
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,400
or sophisticated in that time,

380
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,920
I render something simple.

381
00:22:57,641 --> 00:22:59,961
And rendering does take time, unfortunately,

382
00:23:00,061 --> 00:23:01,442
and definitely teaches patience.

383
00:23:03,564 --> 00:23:08,146
And none of those projects ever feel ready or good enough to be shared online.

384
00:23:08,766 --> 00:23:14,229
But I know that the perfection is the enemy of done, so at some point I need to move on.

385
00:23:14,709 --> 00:23:20,512
And the goal at this point is to progress and learn, not to make something sophisticated.

386
00:23:21,052 --> 00:23:25,974
Of course, feedback loop is part of the learning, this is why it's important to share the work.

387
00:23:26,334 --> 00:23:30,196
As Meg Black said, the work of art is not complete until it's shared.

388
00:23:30,756 --> 00:23:33,217
And you'll be surprised what people respond to.

389
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:39,844
There's nothing more frustrating than trying to solve a problem

390
00:23:40,325 --> 00:23:43,528
that I used to have in the past, but not remembering how I did it.

391
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:47,111
This is why I take tons of notes, and you can find my notes on GitHub.

392
00:23:47,812 --> 00:23:51,675
And I keep all the old files, and I make the same setup

393
00:23:51,816 --> 00:23:53,597
sometimes multiple times to remember.

394
00:23:54,338 --> 00:23:59,042
I also make shareflows, presets and HDAs to recreate setups quicker.

395
00:23:59,943 --> 00:24:04,227
This is also why Houdini is such a great visual learning tool because it's not just easier

396
00:24:04,287 --> 00:24:06,530
to debug but also easier to memorize.

397
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:12,175
And I have here another example to show you that learning math in Houdini can be a lot

398
00:24:12,235 --> 00:24:12,555
of fun.

399
00:24:13,376 --> 00:24:16,919
So idea here was that I wanted to create procedurally

400
00:24:16,979 --> 00:24:20,002
a circle just using attribute wrangle and points

401
00:24:20,082 --> 00:24:22,003
and connect them and make a circle.

402
00:24:22,344 --> 00:24:23,985
So this is the equation that let me do it.

403
00:24:24,665 --> 00:24:26,887
And that was cool, but I was thinking what would happen

404
00:24:26,947 --> 00:24:30,030
if I start modifying this equation and changing things in it.

405
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:34,914
So I got that when I multiplied x and y position by angle.

406
00:24:34,934 --> 00:24:36,615
I got spiral.

407
00:24:37,136 --> 00:24:39,057
And then when I add a change in variable,

408
00:24:39,318 --> 00:24:42,360
like a time to it, I got animation.

409
00:24:44,654 --> 00:24:48,955
And instead of multiplying when I add to x component,

410
00:24:48,995 --> 00:24:49,735
I got a wave.

411
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:51,796
And this.

412
00:24:54,897 --> 00:24:55,457
And that.

413
00:24:56,357 --> 00:24:58,958
And the point is that there is no such thing

414
00:24:59,018 --> 00:25:00,138
like math polis.

415
00:25:00,639 --> 00:25:03,760
Playing with equations and changing variables and numbers

416
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,060
and just seeing what happens is a lot of fun.

417
00:25:09,996 --> 00:25:11,417
So how is this all relevant?

418
00:25:12,037 --> 00:25:13,898
For me, projects in Houdini branched

419
00:25:13,938 --> 00:25:15,518
into learning other software,

420
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,980
Speedtree, Redshift, Substance, Megascans,

421
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,900
GitHub, Nuclino, and much, much more.

422
00:25:20,801 --> 00:25:22,942
Learning logic, math, and scripting

423
00:25:23,062 --> 00:25:24,482
improved my technical skills.

424
00:25:25,103 --> 00:25:27,444
Debugging and solving problems taught me patience

425
00:25:27,504 --> 00:25:28,564
and critical thinking.

426
00:25:29,785 --> 00:25:31,886
I learned how to divide complex problems

427
00:25:31,946 --> 00:25:34,507
into smaller chunks and tons more,

428
00:25:34,847 --> 00:25:37,148
but the good thing is it only got easier from start.

429
00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:39,569
How growing makes me happy?

430
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:43,192
I feel that I'm becoming a better artist.

431
00:25:43,732 --> 00:25:45,833
I like the satisfaction and feedback loop.

432
00:25:46,494 --> 00:25:49,536
I feel like I'm staying current with new technologies and techniques,

433
00:25:49,956 --> 00:25:52,497
which is very relevant to any AAA developer.

434
00:25:53,098 --> 00:25:54,298
I'm widening horizons.

435
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:58,001
It's easier for me to connect with others from different disciplines.

436
00:25:58,121 --> 00:26:02,303
It's easier for me to talk with animators, programmers, designers or lighting artists.

437
00:26:03,051 --> 00:26:06,072
I'm finding things I like, like motion design,

438
00:26:06,192 --> 00:26:08,313
abstract CG, and music videos,

439
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:11,674
which I wouldn't have a chance to discover otherwise.

440
00:26:12,974 --> 00:26:15,035
So, next time you have some time,

441
00:26:15,635 --> 00:26:16,995
see what other artists do,

442
00:26:17,515 --> 00:26:19,576
what excites you and inspires you.

443
00:26:20,436 --> 00:26:21,737
Open your favorite software,

444
00:26:21,857 --> 00:26:23,397
or software you're not familiar with,

445
00:26:23,777 --> 00:26:25,738
and play with it, maybe you even like it.

446
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:29,187
Personal projects are on your rules.

447
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:30,648
You are an art director.

448
00:26:30,948 --> 00:26:32,869
You're deciding what to do, how to do it,

449
00:26:33,089 --> 00:26:34,230
and in what time frame.

450
00:26:34,871 --> 00:26:36,832
Nourish your passion, never stop learning,

451
00:26:37,192 --> 00:26:38,433
and help others to grow.

452
00:26:39,534 --> 00:26:42,356
And remember, tiny potato believes in you.

453
00:26:42,716 --> 00:26:43,657
You can do the thing.

454
00:26:45,718 --> 00:26:47,860
So I wanted to thank everyone who believed in me,

455
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,701
especially my husband, Sean,

456
00:26:50,641 --> 00:26:52,803
Mark Tier for invitation to talk at GDC,

457
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,465
and entire team at id Software for support.

458
00:26:55,825 --> 00:26:56,125
Thank you.

459
00:27:05,337 --> 00:27:07,838
I also supposed to remind you to fill out this survey

460
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:09,880
after we finish with this presentation.

461
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,340
Thank you.

462
00:27:13,543 --> 00:27:15,844
If anybody has questions, do we have time for questions?

463
00:27:17,906 --> 00:27:18,846
Five minutes, okay.

464
00:27:18,886 --> 00:27:20,307
Yeah, we can have some questions then.

465
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:23,170
Anybody?

466
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:28,874
No, no.

467
00:27:29,594 --> 00:27:30,215
I have a question.

468
00:27:30,655 --> 00:27:31,055
Do you have?

469
00:27:31,543 --> 00:27:33,164
times that you like to design?

470
00:27:33,224 --> 00:27:35,785
Like, do you design at night or in the morning,

471
00:27:35,865 --> 00:27:38,645
or do you set certain parameters for yourself?

472
00:27:39,346 --> 00:27:42,186
Yeah, I try to make it a habit, generally.

473
00:27:43,147 --> 00:27:46,868
It's very hard to make it at random times, I would say.

474
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:50,569
So lately, it's been like every second evening.

475
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:54,070
So I would do it Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays,

476
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:57,330
and then on the weekends for four hours a day.

477
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:04,077
And generally with the ideas, I don't spend too much time thinking about them.

478
00:28:04,097 --> 00:28:06,540
I mean, I have a list of ideas, but they're very rough.

479
00:28:06,581 --> 00:28:10,105
It's just whatever I watch on the internet or movie, I just put on my phone

480
00:28:10,145 --> 00:28:13,429
and it's just like a few sentences saying what the idea would be.

481
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:14,250
And then.

482
00:28:14,831 --> 00:28:16,752
when it comes to doing it actually,

483
00:28:17,073 --> 00:28:19,554
I'm trying to implement it roughly really fast.

484
00:28:19,594 --> 00:28:23,137
So if I'm afraid that, well, I don't know if I can pull it off

485
00:28:23,197 --> 00:28:26,279
technically, I try to start with technical side.

486
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,881
And if I can't pull it off, then I either

487
00:28:28,901 --> 00:28:31,683
have to ask somebody for help or drop it and try it later.

488
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:34,045
And if I'm worried about, well,

489
00:28:34,605 --> 00:28:37,228
can I pull it off how it would look like actually,

490
00:28:37,288 --> 00:28:38,609
this is where I would start,

491
00:28:38,649 --> 00:28:40,450
then I would just create camera,

492
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:41,871
whatever I need to see in the camera,

493
00:28:42,252 --> 00:28:44,874
and see like, is this actually working from those angles?

494
00:28:44,954 --> 00:28:46,395
Are people going to be able to understand

495
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:47,536
what I'm trying to show here?

496
00:28:48,237 --> 00:28:50,618
And yeah, again, like if it doesn't work,

497
00:28:50,699 --> 00:28:51,759
I move on very fast.

498
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,643
Those videos I make, this is maybe, I don't know,

499
00:28:55,703 --> 00:28:58,505
like one fourth of the ideas I'm working on,

500
00:28:58,925 --> 00:29:01,447
but many of them I just drop or never finish,

501
00:29:02,088 --> 00:29:03,149
because I don't know how.

502
00:29:04,795 --> 00:29:05,135
Thank you.

503
00:29:08,317 --> 00:29:11,038
You mentioned keeping track of all the stuff

504
00:29:11,058 --> 00:29:12,819
you're trying to remember via GitHub.

505
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:17,502
I was curious, is that shared, or is that a private thing?

506
00:29:18,822 --> 00:29:20,443
I mean, it's in my GitHub account,

507
00:29:20,503 --> 00:29:22,885
but it's completely shared.

508
00:29:22,905 --> 00:29:25,106
You can get access to it, just Google it, and you find it.

509
00:29:25,826 --> 00:29:27,247
Yeah, you will see all my notes

510
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:28,928
with all the grammar mistakes and everything.

511
00:29:28,988 --> 00:29:29,728
It's all there, yeah.

512
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,005
My other question is, where did you find

513
00:29:33,186 --> 00:29:34,687
tiny cat massage music?

514
00:29:36,268 --> 00:29:38,169
That's my husband, he sits right here.

515
00:29:38,229 --> 00:29:39,550
I figured it had to be somebody you knew.

516
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:40,771
It's great, I love the music.

517
00:29:41,011 --> 00:29:42,972
Yeah, he makes music for all my videos.

518
00:29:43,973 --> 00:29:44,454
That's right.

519
00:29:47,336 --> 00:29:51,699
And yeah, his music is I think on iTunes and everywhere.

520
00:29:51,819 --> 00:29:52,880
You can definitely find it.

521
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,942
Hello.

522
00:29:56,242 --> 00:29:56,382
Hi.

523
00:29:57,132 --> 00:30:02,240
So I was always interested in Houdini, but I never started to learn this piece of software

524
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:07,569
And I'm wondering the level of math required to be successful in using Houdini

525
00:30:09,243 --> 00:30:10,083
It all depends.

526
00:30:10,483 --> 00:30:13,304
So some people, for example, use only share of tools,

527
00:30:13,524 --> 00:30:15,585
and you can be pretty successful with that.

528
00:30:15,985 --> 00:30:17,885
But it's the same, for me it's the same

529
00:30:17,905 --> 00:30:20,066
like when I was using Max and Maya, because I know both.

530
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:23,667
And I'll be using Max, and I'll be doing something cool

531
00:30:23,707 --> 00:30:25,287
with particles and destruction,

532
00:30:25,687 --> 00:30:27,288
and at some point I'll get stuck.

533
00:30:27,668 --> 00:30:31,131
Like I can't, for example, instance lights to particles,

534
00:30:31,251 --> 00:30:32,812
you know, like something crazy like that.

535
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:34,093
I want to do it, I can't do it.

536
00:30:34,514 --> 00:30:37,056
And I can't do it without some crazy Python scripting thing.

537
00:30:37,596 --> 00:30:39,197
And I find that actually in Houdini,

538
00:30:39,257 --> 00:30:41,419
yeah, you will get stuck if you use shelf tools.

539
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,561
And at that point, you do want to know

540
00:30:43,661 --> 00:30:44,802
something more about it.

541
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:46,383
But it's actually easier,

542
00:30:46,423 --> 00:30:47,624
because you don't have to know Python.

543
00:30:48,045 --> 00:30:50,126
It's easier to find out what you need to do

544
00:30:50,186 --> 00:30:51,648
to achieve this kind of thing.

545
00:30:52,008 --> 00:30:55,431
So I find myself less stuck in Houdini,

546
00:30:55,931 --> 00:30:57,893
and the only thing that limits me

547
00:30:58,193 --> 00:31:00,074
is my knowledge about how to do it.

548
00:31:00,135 --> 00:31:01,396
And there's a huge community,

549
00:31:02,036 --> 00:31:06,159
and I never seen anybody get stuck for a long time.

550
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:07,681
People usually answer questions

551
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:09,842
when you post to forums and so on.

552
00:31:09,882 --> 00:31:12,605
So it's very easy to get unstuck from things like that

553
00:31:12,685 --> 00:31:14,006
if you really need it to be done.

554
00:31:14,754 --> 00:31:22,698
Okay, basically because you mentioned several pieces of software to learn and to be successful and I know that there's a limit you can't learn

555
00:31:23,538 --> 00:31:30,601
Everything but you mentioned, you know, both max and Maya which is not too common. I think so starting to learn

556
00:31:33,022 --> 00:31:35,003
Let's say Houdini which is quite

557
00:31:35,023 --> 00:31:35,723
Yeah

558
00:31:37,784 --> 00:31:47,630
It's hard to learn. I'm wondering if it's possible to learn this software because I'm a more of a

559
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:55,234
modern guy, I work in asset creation. So in your personal opinion, is it possible to do both

560
00:31:56,195 --> 00:32:02,818
and be good at these things or using Houdini requires the whole attention of the people?

561
00:32:04,638 --> 00:32:10,442
So with creation of assets, there's another thing that if in company you're working and you have

562
00:32:10,482 --> 00:32:16,947
like a technical artist who knows Houdini, they can create tools for you to use in Maya or Max

563
00:32:17,707 --> 00:32:19,829
or even in a game engine you're working in.

564
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:23,614
that you don't need to know everything that happens

565
00:32:23,694 --> 00:32:26,577
behind the scenes, behind the curtains, all the math.

566
00:32:27,098 --> 00:32:30,041
You just get sliders that are relevant to you.

567
00:32:30,102 --> 00:32:32,765
It's similar thing like riggers and animators.

568
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:36,349
Riggers provide a rig and animators just use the rig

569
00:32:36,429 --> 00:32:37,531
to create animation.

570
00:32:38,031 --> 00:32:40,712
And that's completely valid way of working

571
00:32:40,812 --> 00:32:42,272
and many studios do that,

572
00:32:42,332 --> 00:32:44,273
that they have only few people who know Houdini

573
00:32:44,293 --> 00:32:47,394
from inside out to create those HDA assets.

574
00:32:47,774 --> 00:32:52,696
And then everybody else, you know, modelers, animators,

575
00:32:52,796 --> 00:32:55,677
everybody else can use those assets to create IV,

576
00:32:55,717 --> 00:32:56,717
to create buildings,

577
00:32:57,318 --> 00:33:00,218
but they don't have to know inside out everything about it.

578
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:01,779
Okay, thank you very much.

579
00:33:02,219 --> 00:33:02,399
Bye.

580
00:33:05,287 --> 00:33:06,768
Hello, thank you for the presentation.

581
00:33:07,869 --> 00:33:10,873
I've seen you don't use compositing at all in your workflow.

582
00:33:11,293 --> 00:33:16,338
Is it because it's an home setup or is it for you, in your opinion, too much when you're

583
00:33:16,358 --> 00:33:19,241
working alone to try to integrate this kind of pipeline?

584
00:33:20,307 --> 00:33:22,668
You mean real flow? Compositing workflows.

585
00:33:24,629 --> 00:33:31,973
Sometimes you can get more flexibility to rework lighting, colors without re-rendering everything.

586
00:33:32,013 --> 00:33:40,336
Yeah, I mean for those videos I create I use just After Effects and I do use filters of course.

587
00:33:42,657 --> 00:33:46,462
It does help, but they don't render multiple layers

588
00:33:46,603 --> 00:33:47,624
or anything like that.

589
00:33:47,644 --> 00:33:50,187
Shadow maps to try to relate your renderings.

590
00:33:50,568 --> 00:33:53,492
Yeah, I usually, because Redshift is so fast,

591
00:33:54,473 --> 00:33:56,876
I usually just rely whatever it gives me out of the box

592
00:33:57,957 --> 00:34:00,020
and save on time that way.

593
00:34:00,641 --> 00:34:04,763
Because I'm trying to still mainly focus on learning Houdini.

594
00:34:05,063 --> 00:34:08,344
And of course, compositing is a whole new area to learn.

595
00:34:08,765 --> 00:34:10,846
And I did that in past in Maya or Max

596
00:34:10,886 --> 00:34:11,906
when I was running V-Ray.

597
00:34:12,606 --> 00:34:15,768
V-Ray does give very, very good, you know, layers

598
00:34:15,808 --> 00:34:17,148
and you can composite it later.

599
00:34:18,149 --> 00:34:19,690
It's a great workflow, definitely.

600
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:23,331
But with Redshift, I'm just running pretty much as it is

601
00:34:23,431 --> 00:34:25,852
and then I just use filter to correct the colors

602
00:34:26,453 --> 00:34:27,173
and it's done.

603
00:34:27,313 --> 00:34:28,994
I don't composite anything else on top.

604
00:34:29,654 --> 00:34:32,696
And it's much harder if you do a lot of work

605
00:34:32,756 --> 00:34:35,978
with transparency, like fluids plus particles,

606
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:38,639
and you want motion blur on top of that,

607
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:40,440
and trying to composite this,

608
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,221
this is like advanced class for me.

609
00:34:42,241 --> 00:34:46,303
So I would need to look up some tutorials

610
00:34:46,323 --> 00:34:47,224
for that, definitely.

611
00:34:47,404 --> 00:34:49,045
Yeah, you can do pretty nice things.

612
00:34:50,325 --> 00:34:50,625
Thank you.

613
00:34:54,908 --> 00:34:55,228
Cool.

614
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:56,589
All right.

615
00:34:57,269 --> 00:34:58,310
Thanks very much, everybody.
