1
00:00:07,656 --> 00:00:09,397
Hello. Oh, God. You could hear that. Hello.

2
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:12,859
Hello.

3
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:13,920
Hi.

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,981
Thank you very much for coming.

5
00:00:16,341 --> 00:00:18,182
I'm really tired, so you're going to have to put up with that.

6
00:00:18,202 --> 00:00:18,802
So, yeah.

7
00:00:18,822 --> 00:00:21,324
I'm surprised there's this many people here on a Friday afternoon.

8
00:00:21,344 --> 00:00:22,164
I would be in my hotel room asleep by now.

9
00:00:22,204 --> 00:00:22,524
So, good on you.

10
00:00:22,544 --> 00:00:22,685
So, yeah.

11
00:00:22,705 --> 00:00:25,226
I'm surprised there's this many people here on a Friday afternoon.

12
00:00:26,046 --> 00:00:28,548
I would be in my hotel room asleep by now.

13
00:00:28,808 --> 00:00:29,488
So, good on you.

14
00:00:31,502 --> 00:00:36,706
My name is Mike Rose. I have been around for too long.

15
00:00:36,726 --> 00:00:40,589
I used to write about video games many moons

16
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:45,232
ago, and then I moved to a publisher called

17
00:00:45,252 --> 00:00:47,854
TinyBuild, and we did a whole bunch of stuff,

18
00:00:48,555 --> 00:00:51,957
and then I decided I could do this myself.

19
00:00:52,858 --> 00:00:56,981
Like an egotistical bastard. And so I did. Last

20
00:00:57,001 --> 00:00:59,222
year I started my own publishing label called NoMoreRobots.

21
00:01:00,203 --> 00:01:07,853
And the idea is, for anybody who has been following me for a while, you know that I

22
00:01:08,594 --> 00:01:09,375
love numbers.

23
00:01:09,996 --> 00:01:16,705
And I love trying to apply numbers and maths and all that kind of malarkey to making games

24
00:01:16,765 --> 00:01:16,945
sell.

25
00:01:18,407 --> 00:01:19,568
So that's what I tried to do.

26
00:01:19,849 --> 00:01:22,171
And our first game's called Descenders.

27
00:01:23,373 --> 00:01:24,835
It was released last month.

28
00:01:25,756 --> 00:01:28,879
And thank God for me, it has done well.

29
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,704
Which means that, you know, I don't look like an absolute lemon.

30
00:01:34,506 --> 00:01:36,187
And I'm announcing a second game next week,

31
00:01:36,568 --> 00:01:38,769
which is massively exciting and tiring.

32
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:45,073
So this talk is a version of a talk I gave earlier this year.

33
00:01:45,774 --> 00:01:46,735
Sorry, earlier this week.

34
00:01:47,095 --> 00:01:48,436
Well, technically it was earlier this year.

35
00:01:51,838 --> 00:02:02,945
And this talk is focused around the fact that basically on Descenders a big part of my plan

36
00:02:03,005 --> 00:02:05,746
was to spend as little money as possible.

37
00:02:07,047 --> 00:02:10,709
Because I think there's this perception you've got to spend a whole bunch of money on marketing

38
00:02:10,749 --> 00:02:10,889
now.

39
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,691
And if you don't do that, then no one's going to care about your game.

40
00:02:14,751 --> 00:02:21,793
And I've seen people plow like tens of thousands of dollars into marketing their game and honestly

41
00:02:21,874 --> 00:02:23,454
not get a great amount of payoff.

42
00:02:24,174 --> 00:02:29,736
I was trying to work out how much money, because we didn't spend zero, just to be clear.

43
00:02:29,756 --> 00:02:33,538
That was a flippant title, but we spent close to zero.

44
00:02:34,498 --> 00:02:36,779
I think I basically paid...

45
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:41,801
a monthly subscription to MailChimp, which sends out email addresses.

46
00:02:41,821 --> 00:02:47,524
It's probably about $50 a month or something for the last seven months.

47
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:50,986
Outside of that, we've not really spent anything.

48
00:02:51,126 --> 00:02:54,088
Everything that I have done to make Descenders sell

49
00:02:54,688 --> 00:02:58,850
has just been me just hard grafting, basically,

50
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:02,872
and screaming at people until they finally listen.

51
00:03:04,891 --> 00:03:06,472
which is a thing you can do as well.

52
00:03:07,674 --> 00:03:09,656
But maybe not with this accent.

53
00:03:11,017 --> 00:03:11,177
So,

54
00:03:11,337 --> 00:03:12,659
so things I'm not going to be

55
00:03:12,679 --> 00:03:14,581
talking about today are

56
00:03:14,841 --> 00:03:16,583
these kind of things. Now the reason

57
00:03:16,623 --> 00:03:18,765
I'm not, and sorry if that's what you came

58
00:03:18,845 --> 00:03:20,147
for, you can leave.

59
00:03:20,527 --> 00:03:22,429
If you would like, and I won't cry too much,

60
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:22,969
I will.

61
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,451
But things like writing a press release,

62
00:03:27,412 --> 00:03:29,553
getting in touch with YouTubers, all that kind of stuff,

63
00:03:30,614 --> 00:03:32,054
it's been done absolutely to death.

64
00:03:32,114 --> 00:03:33,635
If you go on the GDC vault,

65
00:03:33,655 --> 00:03:35,316
you'll find plenty of talks on this stuff.

66
00:03:35,456 --> 00:03:38,318
Even from me, I have done talks on this.

67
00:03:38,738 --> 00:03:40,839
So you can see me talk about this

68
00:03:40,899 --> 00:03:42,380
if you want on the GDC vault.

69
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,783
There's, there's plenty of stuff that I think is

70
00:03:46,823 --> 00:03:52,209
honestly more important than this that, that I ended

71
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:55,592
up focusing on for Descenders. And I think that,

72
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:58,935
hopefully, you lot are going to be able to

73
00:03:58,955 --> 00:04:00,877
apply it yourselves as well.

74
00:04:01,258 --> 00:04:03,340
Here are the six things we're going to talk

75
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:03,940
about today.

76
00:04:06,522 --> 00:04:12,525
Everything here I'm going to explain in horrible, excruciating detail.

77
00:04:13,645 --> 00:04:17,746
But a lot of this stuff might sound quite simple,

78
00:04:18,246 --> 00:04:20,387
but when I actually say it out loud, you'll be like,

79
00:04:20,507 --> 00:04:21,628
I hadn't thought to do that.

80
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:26,932
So let's just get cracking, because I've got lots of words.

81
00:04:27,452 --> 00:04:31,616
The first step before you even start doing anything is actually working out what is exciting

82
00:04:31,676 --> 00:04:32,216
about the game.

83
00:04:32,616 --> 00:04:37,761
Because as I tell so many people, the thing that you think is exciting about your game,

84
00:04:38,101 --> 00:04:38,782
you are wrong.

85
00:04:38,802 --> 00:04:41,524
It is not the thing that is exciting about your game.

86
00:04:41,924 --> 00:04:43,265
Well it nearly is, alright.

87
00:04:43,706 --> 00:04:46,268
The problem is you're focusing on the wrong thing most likely.

88
00:04:46,888 --> 00:04:51,830
I keep saying you, as if you're wrong, but I mean that most people I talk to who are

89
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:57,432
making games, they are focusing on the wrong thing when it comes to actually talking about

90
00:04:57,472 --> 00:05:01,934
their game publicly, from a marketing perspective, I guess.

91
00:05:02,694 --> 00:05:07,496
A lot of the time, you're focusing on this thing because you think, oh God, people are

92
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:08,297
going to care about this.

93
00:05:08,637 --> 00:05:12,358
And it turns out that, yeah, that's pretty interesting, but it's not actually the thing

94
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:13,319
you should open with.

95
00:05:15,272 --> 00:05:19,275
So, so I've been calling it, like in my head I was calling it this, and then I started

96
00:05:19,315 --> 00:05:22,518
saying it publicly and it sounded really dumb, but I've stuck, I'm doubling down.

97
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:26,340
I call this like the hook and the kicker.

98
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,004
So the thing that I think you are probably focusing on is the kicker.

99
00:05:31,424 --> 00:05:35,527
You are probably focusing on this thing about your game, which yeah, sounds pretty cool,

100
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:39,950
but actually if you open with it and say, hey this is what my game's about, a person

101
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,331
might be like, okay.

102
00:05:42,012 --> 00:05:45,616
Sounds alright, but then maybe they'll drift off and find another game.

103
00:05:46,156 --> 00:05:52,123
What you need first is the thing that's actually exciting about your game that is then going

104
00:05:52,183 --> 00:05:53,384
to link with this other thing.

105
00:05:54,705 --> 00:05:56,387
Let me give you an example.

106
00:05:56,447 --> 00:06:01,913
So with Descenders, from the very beginning, we were talking a lot about the procedural

107
00:06:01,953 --> 00:06:02,974
generation stuff in it.

108
00:06:04,463 --> 00:06:07,124
and for us that seemed like it was going to be really exciting.

109
00:06:07,144 --> 00:06:08,264
People were going to care about this.

110
00:06:08,684 --> 00:06:11,745
But here's the thing, loads of games do procedural generation now.

111
00:06:11,885 --> 00:06:13,505
You know, like it's cool.

112
00:06:14,045 --> 00:06:15,286
Procedural generation is cool.

113
00:06:15,826 --> 00:06:20,147
But it's not like a publicly facing thing

114
00:06:20,267 --> 00:06:22,808
that whole marketing campaigns are sold on.

115
00:06:23,768 --> 00:06:27,229
So we needed like the thing that procedural generation

116
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:29,269
could actually follow on from.

117
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:32,390
It turned out that I was literally just telling people

118
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:36,491
from, you know, kind of trying to describe the game to people in many different ways.

119
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:41,012
It turned out when we actually just told people that it was a downhill mountain biking game,

120
00:06:41,412 --> 00:06:44,313
that was enough to just grab them initially

121
00:06:44,533 --> 00:06:47,394
because no one's really doing downhill mountain biking games.

122
00:06:47,994 --> 00:06:53,402
When we then followed up with, oh yeah, and it has procedurally generated worlds in it,

123
00:06:53,862 --> 00:06:56,546
that's the bit where they'd be like, what?

124
00:06:56,706 --> 00:06:59,330
How does a mountain bike game have procedural worlds?

125
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,632
That's not right.

126
00:07:01,473 --> 00:07:03,656
So you can see how, like...

127
00:07:04,877 --> 00:07:06,978
taking procedural world, which is, eh,

128
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:10,120
and then actually making it sound like,

129
00:07:10,421 --> 00:07:11,682
I wanna know more about this.

130
00:07:12,962 --> 00:07:16,985
You take this one part, and it elevates the second part,

131
00:07:17,025 --> 00:07:19,327
but the second part by itself possibly

132
00:07:19,347 --> 00:07:20,728
isn't as exciting as you think.

133
00:07:21,368 --> 00:07:24,150
Trying to work out your own line

134
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,831
for your game like this one at the bottom

135
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:27,132
is really important.

136
00:07:27,652 --> 00:07:33,500
you can do that by just trying to describe your game to different types of people over

137
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:37,325
and over again in different ways until you finally start getting the reaction that you

138
00:07:37,345 --> 00:07:37,845
deserve.

139
00:07:39,688 --> 00:07:41,770
It's a really important thing to do because it will...

140
00:07:42,892 --> 00:07:46,215
it will kind of, you can take it into a lot of other things as well,

141
00:07:46,855 --> 00:07:49,658
especially even when you're just designing the game.

142
00:07:50,298 --> 00:07:53,041
If you've worked out exactly what it is that people find exciting,

143
00:07:53,221 --> 00:07:56,183
it might start to sort of show you

144
00:07:56,404 --> 00:07:57,885
what direction to take your game in as well.

145
00:08:00,422 --> 00:08:06,044
So I, this is another thing that I think a lot of people don't realize is so important.

146
00:08:06,304 --> 00:08:13,427
I see people all the time, they'll, someone will put out a trailer for a game, or they'll

147
00:08:13,447 --> 00:08:16,668
put out a website, or they'll put something on Twitter and they'll get a ton of retweets,

148
00:08:17,989 --> 00:08:19,970
and that's great, but then...

149
00:08:21,829 --> 00:08:26,733
then they go off and they make the game and the people, those 100,000 people you got on

150
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:30,937
your trailer or whatever, they go off and they play other games and then by the time

151
00:08:31,037 --> 00:08:34,480
your game's coming out, they've basically forgotten about your game and all that work

152
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:40,046
you did in the first place was kind of for nothing because, you know, we know how fast

153
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,228
games are moving now in like six months.

154
00:08:43,068 --> 00:08:44,550
They probably don't remember your game anymore.

155
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,131
So a big question is...

156
00:08:47,873 --> 00:08:52,295
if someone is showing interest, if somebody, if you're announcing your game and you're putting

157
00:08:52,355 --> 00:08:58,397
out a trailer or anything like that, and someone like thinks, hey, this is kind of cool, I'd like

158
00:08:58,417 --> 00:09:06,060
to be more involved, what exactly is it that they can get involved with where you can kind of hook

159
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:13,342
them and keep them until the game is available and hope that they will buy it? For us, and I

160
00:09:13,362 --> 00:09:15,783
think this will work for a lot of people, it's Discord.

161
00:09:16,363 --> 00:09:19,066
I started fiddling with Discord a couple of years ago,

162
00:09:19,086 --> 00:09:20,387
and at first I didn't get it.

163
00:09:20,447 --> 00:09:23,629
It seemed like it was just another Skype, but it was purple.

164
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,711
It seemed very strange.

165
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:30,034
I mean, you know, like, everyone's used every chat-based thing under the sun.

166
00:09:31,676 --> 00:09:31,876
But...

167
00:09:33,277 --> 00:09:38,723
But the cool thing about Discord is that, I mean, it's a slick system, but also they've

168
00:09:38,763 --> 00:09:44,089
just got kind of lucky, really, and they've managed to just get shedloads of people joining.

169
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,273
And they're all people who actually buy video games.

170
00:09:48,194 --> 00:09:51,838
So what we did was we started a Discord for Descenders.

171
00:09:53,612 --> 00:09:57,074
Now when people ask me how you start a Discord,

172
00:09:57,554 --> 00:10:01,656
you don't just make a cool place where people can chill about your game.

173
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:02,917
Because no one wants to do that.

174
00:10:03,017 --> 00:10:06,579
No one wants to just come and chill in your Discord until the game's out.

175
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:07,540
That's not a reason.

176
00:10:08,561 --> 00:10:12,063
You've got to actually have a reason why they're going to come and hang out

177
00:10:13,063 --> 00:10:14,124
in this little chat room.

178
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:22,335
And the main way that we managed to do that was that we ran the closed beta for Descenders through Discord.

179
00:10:22,396 --> 00:10:28,204
So when we announced the game, we said, hey, if you want to be involved in the closed beta for this game,

180
00:10:28,645 --> 00:10:30,507
you are going to have to join our Discord.

181
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:33,531
and thousands of people did that.

182
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:36,193
When we announced the game, they'd watch the trailer

183
00:10:36,574 --> 00:10:38,295
and then the link would be right there under the trailer

184
00:10:38,395 --> 00:10:41,198
or when a press place talked about it,

185
00:10:41,598 --> 00:10:43,720
they always say, oh hey, if you want to be involved

186
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,822
in the beta, here's a link to the Discord.

187
00:10:46,857 --> 00:10:49,479
And we got thousands and thousands of people coming through there.

188
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,362
And at that point then, once we had them,

189
00:10:52,823 --> 00:10:55,585
we then started giving them things to do.

190
00:10:56,006 --> 00:11:01,952
So I set up the Discord using a variety of bots.

191
00:11:02,452 --> 00:11:05,535
I made it so that when someone first joined the Descenders Discord,

192
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,319
they only had access to one channel that was called Pick Aside.

193
00:11:10,204 --> 00:11:13,026
And in the game there's three different kind of teams,

194
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:14,267
factions that you can join.

195
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:17,289
And we made it so that they had to pick one of these three

196
00:11:17,349 --> 00:11:20,151
teams before they were allowed any access to the Discord.

197
00:11:20,731 --> 00:11:24,394
And this essentially caused like a tribe mentality,

198
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,915
where then like on a weekly basis

199
00:11:25,995 --> 00:11:29,197
we gave them tasks to do against each other.

200
00:11:29,217 --> 00:11:30,878
You've got to come up with the best one of these

201
00:11:30,918 --> 00:11:31,739
or the best one of that.

202
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:34,240
And then we started giving them things to actually design

203
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,001
for in the game.

204
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:38,263
Let's design some kits and let's design some banners

205
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,064
and all this kind of stuff.

206
00:11:40,085 --> 00:11:43,650
it meant that by the time the game came, eventually came out,

207
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:51,341
we were pretty damn certain that we had at least x amount of people who were going to

208
00:11:51,441 --> 00:11:57,023
buy this game within the first 24 hours because they were all just like feverish for it.

209
00:11:57,543 --> 00:12:02,045
In fact, when we launched the game, we were going to launch the game at sort of 4 o'clock

210
00:12:02,685 --> 00:12:08,647
and at 20 minutes to 4, we were just like, hey, let's do this.

211
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:12,028
Let's just launch it 20 minutes early and we'll only tell Discord just to say thanks

212
00:12:12,068 --> 00:12:12,709
to these guys.

213
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:16,230
And then we'll officially announce the launch at 4 o'clock.

214
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:22,131
So we launched it, but what I didn't realize was that the launch discount of 10% wouldn't

215
00:12:22,171 --> 00:12:24,151
kick in until 4 o'clock.

216
00:12:24,771 --> 00:12:28,812
So I run into the Discord, I'm like, oh God, I'm really sorry everyone, like, the, the,

217
00:12:29,313 --> 00:12:32,333
you know, just wait, just hold off, I know it's available, just hold off 20 minutes.

218
00:12:32,673 --> 00:12:37,054
We sold like a thousand copies in 20 minutes from all the people in Discord, because they

219
00:12:37,094 --> 00:12:39,955
didn't give a crap that it was, that there was no Discord.

220
00:12:40,115 --> 00:12:41,255
They needed it now.

221
00:12:41,575 --> 00:12:42,796
They needed the game right now.

222
00:12:44,536 --> 00:12:47,039
And it's been incredible.

223
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,420
It's been absolutely incredible for the game,

224
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,644
because it's the kind of longevity of the tale of sales

225
00:12:52,724 --> 00:12:54,105
as well has been amazing.

226
00:12:54,165 --> 00:12:56,187
People who kind of see the game and think,

227
00:12:56,247 --> 00:12:57,108
oh, I might be interested in this,

228
00:12:57,128 --> 00:12:59,590
they join the Discord just to see what the community's like.

229
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,432
We've got this super active community.

230
00:13:01,472 --> 00:13:04,134
They join and immediately are greeted by a bunch of people.

231
00:13:04,835 --> 00:13:06,376
And within a very small amount of time,

232
00:13:06,396 --> 00:13:07,637
they decide, yeah, all right, cool,

233
00:13:07,658 --> 00:13:09,039
and then I want to be involved in this as well.

234
00:13:12,181 --> 00:13:14,463
So, I honestly, I can't stress enough,

235
00:13:14,924 --> 00:13:16,945
like, doing this Discord stuff,

236
00:13:17,085 --> 00:13:20,288
I have plans to do Discord for every game that I do now.

237
00:13:21,048 --> 00:13:23,010
It's probably going to become a logistical nightmare.

238
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:28,314
But it's honestly something you should 100% look into.

239
00:13:30,755 --> 00:13:36,677
So, this one is an interesting one because I think probably a lot of people don't think

240
00:13:36,737 --> 00:13:38,217
about this.

241
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:45,699
When I say the right vibe, I mean when people are seeing your game, what is it that they

242
00:13:45,739 --> 00:13:50,241
are perceiving it to be in terms of those horrible things we don't like to think about.

243
00:13:50,281 --> 00:13:51,921
What value are they perceiving?

244
00:13:53,702 --> 00:13:55,703
The, the way that you present your game,

245
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:58,544
I think right now, especially with so many games

246
00:13:58,584 --> 00:14:00,105
coming out, is incredibly important.

247
00:14:00,445 --> 00:14:04,667
Your game needs to be perceived that it is

248
00:14:05,087 --> 00:14:07,488
more interesting than all the ones around it.

249
00:14:07,568 --> 00:14:08,849
Your game, when it comes out that day,

250
00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:11,210
is gonna be in the middle of 40 other games,

251
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,511
right, when it, when it drops.

252
00:14:12,971 --> 00:14:14,792
Why are people picking your game out?

253
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,661
Again, with Descenders, when we announced that,

254
00:14:20,062 --> 00:14:23,583
we'd been originally talking that,

255
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:28,645
oh, maybe people would pay, you know, sort of $15 for this.

256
00:14:28,665 --> 00:14:31,966
We honestly had no great idea

257
00:14:31,986 --> 00:14:35,848
about how much people would be into a mountain biking game.

258
00:14:37,426 --> 00:14:44,995
But we wanted to just try and give off this perception that it was sort of this AA game,

259
00:14:45,015 --> 00:14:50,481
you know, somewhere in between like a traditional indie title and AAA.

260
00:14:52,063 --> 00:14:54,944
And so we worked incredibly hard on trying to make this image.

261
00:14:55,864 --> 00:14:57,204
The trailer we tried to make,

262
00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:02,346
we made like over two dozen drafts of this trailer for the game

263
00:15:02,586 --> 00:15:04,507
over and over and over again for about three weeks

264
00:15:04,587 --> 00:15:06,827
just to try and make it look as AAA as possible.

265
00:15:08,048 --> 00:15:09,248
All of the assets we were doing,

266
00:15:09,288 --> 00:15:10,728
all the ways we were talking about the game,

267
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:12,389
the way we were presenting the game.

268
00:15:13,989 --> 00:15:15,710
We spent an incredible amount of time on this.

269
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:19,051
And when it did come out, a lot of people...

270
00:15:20,131 --> 00:15:25,074
accidentally thought that it was like this this massive game made by this

271
00:15:25,114 --> 00:15:29,677
massive team there was comments on the YouTube video that were like well I'd

272
00:15:29,697 --> 00:15:34,840
only pay $40 for this which was incredible for us because there's three

273
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,780
guys making it so

274
00:15:39,322 --> 00:15:45,328
So, the fact of the matter is that different games have different images, right?

275
00:15:45,428 --> 00:15:51,774
The next game I'm announcing next week is definitely more towards the more traditional

276
00:15:51,814 --> 00:15:55,758
indie scale, so we're working out then what image we're building around that.

277
00:15:57,349 --> 00:16:00,810
But the value that is perceived,

278
00:16:01,031 --> 00:16:02,531
I know we hate talking about like,

279
00:16:02,551 --> 00:16:03,852
well how much is my game worth?

280
00:16:03,892 --> 00:16:05,132
What should I price it and all that?

281
00:16:06,293 --> 00:16:08,674
You can really help those kind of conversations

282
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,855
by deciding how do I want my game to be perceived?

283
00:16:11,895 --> 00:16:14,256
What value do I want my game to be perceived in?

284
00:16:14,796 --> 00:16:16,337
And then just starting from there.

285
00:16:16,677 --> 00:16:18,177
And if it turns out that maybe people

286
00:16:18,197 --> 00:16:19,838
don't buy into the image so much,

287
00:16:20,058 --> 00:16:21,699
you can go down from there, right?

288
00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:23,679
But you can't, if you start off with,

289
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,381
it's not worth as much.

290
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,723
And then it turns out that maybe, you know,

291
00:16:28,763 --> 00:16:30,004
people would have been more interested in,

292
00:16:30,164 --> 00:16:32,425
in, you know, sort of looking at it in a,

293
00:16:32,705 --> 00:16:33,686
in a higher perspective.

294
00:16:34,206 --> 00:16:35,467
It's more difficult to come back from that.

295
00:16:36,648 --> 00:16:38,169
Um, all right.

296
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:40,311
With a lot of the stuff that I'm talking about,

297
00:16:41,131 --> 00:16:42,432
and a lot of the stuff that we did,

298
00:16:42,452 --> 00:16:44,814
um, it's, uh,

299
00:16:45,374 --> 00:16:47,636
it's about not relying on luck.

300
00:16:48,316 --> 00:16:48,416
Um,

301
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:53,375
I think that with the vast majority of the games that come out now,

302
00:16:54,335 --> 00:16:56,376
and it's been like this for a long time,

303
00:16:56,516 --> 00:17:01,078
but I think a lot of developers rely on luck,

304
00:17:01,238 --> 00:17:02,779
rely on, you know, sort of saying,

305
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:04,839
alright, I've done everything,

306
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:08,921
I've tried to put press releases in these places,

307
00:17:08,941 --> 00:17:09,822
I've done some tweets,

308
00:17:10,202 --> 00:17:12,563
hopefully the day that my game comes out,

309
00:17:13,623 --> 00:17:14,944
people are just going to buy it.

310
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,169
And you can't do that. You absolutely cannot do that.

311
00:17:18,469 --> 00:17:21,134
You need to make sure that on the day your game comes out,

312
00:17:21,395 --> 00:17:24,060
you're pretty certain you've put enough stuff in place

313
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,626
that it's going to at least do a baseline well.

314
00:17:29,677 --> 00:17:31,418
there's plenty of stuff you can do to do that.

315
00:17:31,778 --> 00:17:33,899
The Discord stuff I was talking about earlier, for example,

316
00:17:33,939 --> 00:17:35,641
is a great example of that, right?

317
00:17:36,061 --> 00:17:38,923
Like I told you, we had thousands of people in the Discord.

318
00:17:38,963 --> 00:17:40,864
We could see how much they wanted the game.

319
00:17:40,884 --> 00:17:42,725
They were asking for it on a daily basis

320
00:17:42,785 --> 00:17:43,626
before we launched it.

321
00:17:43,966 --> 00:17:46,748
So we were pretty confident we were at least getting

322
00:17:46,968 --> 00:17:48,209
X amount of sales from that.

323
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,151
There was other stuff we were putting in place as well.

324
00:17:51,191 --> 00:17:54,273
You know, we were talking to different platforms,

325
00:17:54,293 --> 00:17:55,114
different communities.

326
00:17:55,194 --> 00:17:56,655
We'd been talking to Steam a lot.

327
00:17:58,716 --> 00:18:01,298
and just hounding them about what is it we can do

328
00:18:01,778 --> 00:18:07,483
to make sure that on the day our game sort of does as well as possible.

329
00:18:09,224 --> 00:18:13,347
There's plenty of ways to actually...

330
00:18:15,787 --> 00:18:19,813
not guarantee success, I'm not going to tell anybody in here that I can guarantee success,

331
00:18:20,274 --> 00:18:27,223
but there's a lot of ways to at least guarantee a baseline of success in that you're not just

332
00:18:27,263 --> 00:18:32,790
like sat there like scared out of your mind on launch day with your fingers crossed.

333
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,032
There's plenty of stuff you can put in place.

334
00:18:35,992 --> 00:18:38,593
Unfortunately, to put a lot of this stuff in place,

335
00:18:39,473 --> 00:18:42,455
you have to do some horrible things

336
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:47,657
that I found the vast majority of people don't like doing.

337
00:18:49,445 --> 00:18:51,845
You can probably tell just from the way I talk

338
00:18:52,086 --> 00:18:59,928
and from my general demeanor that I don't mind doing this stuff at all.

339
00:19:00,328 --> 00:19:07,650
I am very much a person who will just sort of ask for everything

340
00:19:08,171 --> 00:19:10,751
and will just go in and just fit.

341
00:19:11,232 --> 00:19:15,593
It's not that I believe, you know, like, that I deserve any of this.

342
00:19:15,713 --> 00:19:16,533
It's more that...

343
00:19:17,274 --> 00:19:22,856
I know that if I ask, I have a chance of maybe getting help from people and from platforms.

344
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:25,797
And if I don't ask, I definitely don't.

345
00:19:26,317 --> 00:19:28,998
That's the absolute bottom line on it.

346
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:32,459
So asking for stuff.

347
00:19:33,624 --> 00:19:38,888
is honestly just one of, it's, I've been saying it for years,

348
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:42,551
and I know there'll be loads of people in here who'll be like,

349
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:47,115
I can't do that. I can't email people or get in touch with people just asking for stuff.

350
00:19:48,836 --> 00:19:51,358
every single thing that I have put in place for Descenders,

351
00:19:51,578 --> 00:19:53,279
I asked for, no one came to me.

352
00:19:53,699 --> 00:19:56,041
Xbox didn't come to me and say,

353
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,923
hey, we've seen Descenders, can we work out all this stuff?

354
00:19:59,443 --> 00:20:02,005
I went to them and I shoved Descenders in their face

355
00:20:02,165 --> 00:20:04,106
and said, what can we do together?

356
00:20:04,467 --> 00:20:06,888
not a, can we do something, what can we do together?

357
00:20:07,188 --> 00:20:08,269
Can we do this, can we do that?

358
00:20:08,329 --> 00:20:10,271
And now I've put deals in place with them.

359
00:20:10,571 --> 00:20:13,433
With Discord, I started setting up the Discord stuff

360
00:20:13,693 --> 00:20:15,754
and then I shoved myself in Discord's faces

361
00:20:15,834 --> 00:20:18,556
saying I found a contact, I just worked out,

362
00:20:18,696 --> 00:20:19,737
oh, who can I talk to here?

363
00:20:19,797 --> 00:20:21,338
Finally found a person to talk to

364
00:20:21,818 --> 00:20:24,240
and now I'm sort of working out a bunch of stuff

365
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,781
with Discord that we can do with them.

366
00:20:26,781 --> 00:20:28,162
Another platform, Mixer.

367
00:20:30,244 --> 00:20:37,326
So, if you're not aware, Mixer is essentially Microsoft's version of Twitch that also is

368
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:38,366
on the Xbox dashboard.

369
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:45,228
I started streaming on Mixer just because I like to always just try and be ahead of

370
00:20:45,268 --> 00:20:51,350
the curve, so I try everything that's new, and then just stick with the things that actually

371
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:51,630
work.

372
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:55,855
And with Mixer, I started streaming a lot on Mixer.

373
00:20:56,376 --> 00:21:00,241
And then I emailed them just saying, hey, is there any

374
00:21:00,261 --> 00:21:01,323
fact I can get involved with?

375
00:21:01,943 --> 00:21:05,268
And they got back to me saying, oh yeah, actually, we

376
00:21:05,288 --> 00:21:07,511
do developer accounts on Mixer.

377
00:21:07,591 --> 00:21:08,753
Do you want one of those?

378
00:21:09,494 --> 00:21:10,655
I was like, yeah, OK.

379
00:21:11,696 --> 00:21:14,258
And a couple of days later, they'd verified my account.

380
00:21:14,298 --> 00:21:16,500
And the next time I streamed, I was front page of Mixer.

381
00:21:17,121 --> 00:21:19,763
And now I'll randomly be front page of Mixer whenever I

382
00:21:19,783 --> 00:21:22,446
stream, because that's apparently a thing they do.

383
00:21:22,726 --> 00:21:24,407
But I only found out by asking.

384
00:21:25,768 --> 00:21:28,170
It's, it's this kind of thing where if you're not

385
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:31,411
just absolutely just asking and talking to everybody,

386
00:21:31,671 --> 00:21:32,832
nothing's ever going to happen.

387
00:21:33,172 --> 00:21:35,613
The worst thing that's going to happen is you're going to ask someone for something

388
00:21:35,674 --> 00:21:37,174
and they're not going to respond to you.

389
00:21:37,655 --> 00:21:39,375
And then you'll feel a bit crap inside.

390
00:21:39,736 --> 00:21:41,096
But, but who cares?

391
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,597
Because at least you asked.

392
00:21:43,538 --> 00:21:47,820
Asking for stuff is, is just incredibly important.

393
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,202
And when I was, when I was saying this earlier this week,

394
00:21:51,222 --> 00:21:54,043
I was talking to a guy who, who just said to me,

395
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,264
I just can't do that.

396
00:21:55,384 --> 00:21:57,004
I can't, I just can't ask.

397
00:21:57,084 --> 00:21:59,626
It feels so, like, reckless and horrible.

398
00:22:00,266 --> 00:22:04,628
And I, I, I just said to him, just try it for a month.

399
00:22:04,928 --> 00:22:06,849
Just try asking for stuff for a month.

400
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,030
And if at the end of the month you're like,

401
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:12,212
oh, that was so horrible, and now I feel dead inside,

402
00:22:12,612 --> 00:22:13,853
then all right, fine.

403
00:22:13,873 --> 00:22:16,434
Get someone else to do it for you instead.

404
00:22:16,954 --> 00:22:26,544
But really, honestly, you'd be surprised at the times when I have just out of the blue

405
00:22:26,784 --> 00:22:28,887
asked someone for something and they've gone,

406
00:22:28,907 --> 00:22:30,488
alright, yeah, cool, let's work something out.

407
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,231
It's easier than you think.

408
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:37,055
You've just got to get over that little voice in your head that's saying,

409
00:22:37,135 --> 00:22:37,996
this is horrible.

410
00:22:41,157 --> 00:22:44,178
The final thing is that out of everything that's happening,

411
00:22:44,439 --> 00:22:46,460
you just gotta be realistic, all right?

412
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,901
And when I say that, I mean you need to

413
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:53,963
have a plan in your head for if your game

414
00:22:54,424 --> 00:22:56,965
ends up making sort of the average

415
00:22:57,145 --> 00:22:59,646
or less than the average of what a game is making

416
00:23:00,127 --> 00:23:02,668
on Steam right now, is that gonna be okay

417
00:23:02,988 --> 00:23:04,289
for you and your situation?

418
00:23:06,371 --> 00:23:08,232
or are you going to have problems?

419
00:23:08,272 --> 00:23:10,495
And if you are going to have problems, what are you going to do about it?

420
00:23:10,535 --> 00:23:12,196
You need to be able to take those numbers

421
00:23:13,097 --> 00:23:17,382
and actually have plans in your head for what's going to happen.

422
00:23:17,982 --> 00:23:21,005
I mean, when we were doing Descender stuff...

423
00:23:21,921 --> 00:23:22,741
We did this.

424
00:23:22,821 --> 00:23:25,602
We all sat down and we were like, OK, so what

425
00:23:25,802 --> 00:23:27,142
if Descenders tanks?

426
00:23:27,682 --> 00:23:31,503
Because you've got to ask yourself that question.

427
00:23:31,663 --> 00:23:33,784
I was optimistic it was going to do well,

428
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,424
but this is video games.

429
00:23:36,604 --> 00:23:40,325
So we had to be really realistic and say, all right,

430
00:23:40,605 --> 00:23:41,846
if it tanks, what are we going to do?

431
00:23:42,206 --> 00:23:44,546
We had plans for, all right, if it only

432
00:23:44,586 --> 00:23:46,747
makes this amount of money, then we're

433
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:48,947
going to have to scale back scope.

434
00:23:49,067 --> 00:23:51,668
We're going to have to aim for roundabout this day.

435
00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:53,833
and then we'll work out what happens then.

436
00:23:54,595 --> 00:23:57,742
If it does well, then yeah, we can kind of stick

437
00:23:57,802 --> 00:23:59,346
to these more longer term plans.

438
00:24:01,193 --> 00:24:03,275
You got to ask yourself these questions as well, because

439
00:24:05,117 --> 00:24:07,659
for anybody who has launched a video game knows that

440
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:11,221
no matter whether it's done well or badly,

441
00:24:11,381 --> 00:24:13,943
you still feel depressed and awful after it.

442
00:24:14,424 --> 00:24:17,526
So the situation you don't want to be in is that you launch a game

443
00:24:17,646 --> 00:24:20,569
and it does badly, and then you don't have a plan,

444
00:24:21,089 --> 00:24:22,170
and then you're just like...

445
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:23,911
a husk of a person.

446
00:24:25,493 --> 00:24:28,035
At least having that plan in place means that

447
00:24:28,075 --> 00:24:30,257
it becomes ever slightly more bearable.

448
00:24:31,078 --> 00:24:35,082
I know this is kind of a slightly

449
00:24:35,162 --> 00:24:37,044
lower note to end on, but that's just the

450
00:24:37,084 --> 00:24:39,266
way that I structured this talk, so I apologize for that.

451
00:24:41,451 --> 00:24:43,773
So anyway, yeah, kind of just to wrap up,

452
00:24:44,834 --> 00:24:48,357
really, really think about what it is

453
00:24:48,397 --> 00:24:49,798
that's actually interesting about your game.

454
00:24:49,838 --> 00:24:50,718
Talk to other people.

455
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:53,260
See what they think is interesting about your game.

456
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,142
Try and work out that exact thing.

457
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:59,645
Work out ways to keep people interested

458
00:24:59,765 --> 00:25:01,347
once you have started talking about your game.

459
00:25:01,427 --> 00:25:03,648
Things like Discord, things like Mixer.

460
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,490
There's bound to be other platforms

461
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,611
that are popping up as well.

462
00:25:06,991 --> 00:25:08,332
Anything that's new, just try it out.

463
00:25:09,273 --> 00:25:13,555
you never know it might actually do the works for you.

464
00:25:15,116 --> 00:25:21,920
And like I said, just try to start just gritting your teeth

465
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,322
and asking for stuff and trying to hunt anything down

466
00:25:25,362 --> 00:25:25,922
that you can.

467
00:25:26,302 --> 00:25:28,964
It might be, there'll be people who are sitting here

468
00:25:29,084 --> 00:25:32,106
and thinking like, oh well, this platform holder

469
00:25:32,126 --> 00:25:33,526
and that platform holder and this company,

470
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:35,808
they're not gonna care about the thing I'm making.

471
00:25:36,628 --> 00:25:38,029
They very well might do.

472
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:42,473
You just gotta ask them and see,

473
00:25:42,533 --> 00:25:45,054
because you might surprise yourself.

474
00:25:47,076 --> 00:25:48,557
Right, said a bunch of words.

475
00:25:48,577 --> 00:25:49,918
Thank you very much.

476
00:26:00,065 --> 00:26:02,027
I have no idea if we've got time for,

477
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:03,368
do we have time for questions?

478
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,880
Three minutes, I get one question.

479
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,681
Whoever gets to one of the microphone,

480
00:26:08,701 --> 00:26:11,002
actually I shouldn't say that.

481
00:26:11,562 --> 00:26:12,823
All right, hello.

482
00:26:13,283 --> 00:26:13,563
Hello.

483
00:26:15,684 --> 00:26:17,484
I'm actually one who asked about the Discord

484
00:26:17,524 --> 00:26:19,465
because I know about Discord

485
00:26:19,485 --> 00:26:20,946
and I'm almost like searching for it

486
00:26:21,126 --> 00:26:23,587
and I see it's things that is most suitable

487
00:26:23,607 --> 00:26:25,628
for those like strategy games

488
00:26:25,688 --> 00:26:26,728
and all that call up games,

489
00:26:26,748 --> 00:26:28,669
there's like lots and lots of discussion.

490
00:26:28,769 --> 00:26:32,770
But for us, we have like a very narrative to run game.

491
00:26:33,698 --> 00:26:38,487
And then we don't think about doing a beta or a demo.

492
00:26:38,547 --> 00:26:42,775
So I don't know how I can work with Discord to promote our game.

493
00:26:48,597 --> 00:26:52,919
I'm, so I'm, like I said, I'm announcing another game next week, and the game I'm announcing

494
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:56,721
next week is a very niche, single player experience.

495
00:26:57,081 --> 00:27:03,344
And so I, for a while, was struggling to like think, well, Descendants made more sense for

496
00:27:03,364 --> 00:27:03,884
Discord.

497
00:27:04,204 --> 00:27:07,606
If I, I feel like if I'm going to do Discord with this next game, I'm just going to be

498
00:27:08,146 --> 00:27:10,707
just kind of ramming a circle into a square.

499
00:27:12,348 --> 00:27:16,569
But then the thing was, when I started to really think,

500
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:19,089
okay, well, what actually is possible with this thing?

501
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:22,770
I started to realize that there's,

502
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,571
when you really have an explore of what is possible

503
00:27:26,651 --> 00:27:28,191
with all the kind of bots and stuff

504
00:27:28,211 --> 00:27:29,371
that are available on Discord,

505
00:27:29,811 --> 00:27:31,331
there's some crazy things you can do.

506
00:27:31,672 --> 00:27:33,352
I'm setting up this Discord server,

507
00:27:33,392 --> 00:27:35,952
I'm kind of putting the finishing touches on it right now,

508
00:27:36,372 --> 00:27:38,633
that is way weirder than the Descenders Discord,

509
00:27:39,673 --> 00:27:40,653
where people...

510
00:27:41,554 --> 00:27:48,921
join the discord and they essentially are given a channel where they live and that's

511
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:53,806
like where they start off and it's like a base channel and then they have to work in

512
00:27:53,826 --> 00:28:00,112
the discord to earn money to then be able to buy their way into better property in the

513
00:28:00,152 --> 00:28:00,652
discord.

514
00:28:01,173 --> 00:28:02,453
and they have to go to work.

515
00:28:02,513 --> 00:28:04,854
When they go to work, home disappears.

516
00:28:05,154 --> 00:28:06,175
The home channels disappear,

517
00:28:06,235 --> 00:28:08,415
and all the work channels appear.

518
00:28:08,795 --> 00:28:12,097
And they have to then go there and work in these places

519
00:28:12,617 --> 00:28:13,497
and do this loop.

520
00:28:13,877 --> 00:28:16,238
And then every week, the top 10 people

521
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:19,059
who have the most money and the most standing in the server

522
00:28:19,579 --> 00:28:22,940
then become these gold players in the server

523
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,261
and are eventually gonna have their names in the game.

524
00:28:27,248 --> 00:28:30,617
This is just the stupid stuff that happens in my brain.

525
00:28:31,098 --> 00:28:33,264
But you can see how essentially creating.

526
00:28:36,885 --> 00:28:41,188
this kind of miniature meta game in Discord.

527
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:44,590
I haven't launched it yet, so maybe no one will care,

528
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:48,372
but I'm hoping that it will at least give

529
00:28:48,932 --> 00:28:52,775
a small subset of people a reason to stick around,

530
00:28:53,755 --> 00:28:58,218
even if it has no real, them playing this thing

531
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:01,019
has no standing on what the game

532
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,240
that eventually comes out is.

533
00:29:04,315 --> 00:29:08,436
So I think there's plenty of possibilities even when it seems like there's not.

534
00:29:10,396 --> 00:29:16,918
But yeah, I guess I'll have to keep trying it for more and more games.

535
00:29:17,118 --> 00:29:20,199
I do know that something Discord are doing is they are

536
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:24,600
they're kind of revamping how bots work in Discord right now

537
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,121
and trying to support a lot more people making these things.

538
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:30,361
So I reckon in the next year, there's going to be.

539
00:29:31,022 --> 00:29:36,304
a whole lot of additional kind of interactivity stuff that's going to come to Discord.

540
00:29:37,225 --> 00:29:41,507
So I imagine in a year's time the Discord servers we're going to be seeing are going

541
00:29:41,527 --> 00:29:43,288
to be just ridiculous.

542
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:49,051
So you might as well start exploring it now so you can be one of those ridiculous people.

543
00:29:49,931 --> 00:29:50,272
Thank you.

544
00:29:50,672 --> 00:29:51,012
No worries.

545
00:29:51,892 --> 00:29:52,413
All right.

546
00:29:52,653 --> 00:29:52,853
Cool.

547
00:29:53,433 --> 00:29:53,753
Bye, everyone.
