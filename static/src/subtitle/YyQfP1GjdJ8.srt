1
00:00:05,597 --> 00:00:07,638
to snap to character, building strong player attachment

2
00:00:07,658 --> 00:00:08,158
through narrative.

3
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:09,979
I really appreciate you coming.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,661
So what does that long-winded title even mean, really?

5
00:00:14,221 --> 00:00:16,242
I mean, I think we can all think of games that we've played

6
00:00:16,262 --> 00:00:18,564
where we encountered characters that sort of stuck

7
00:00:18,584 --> 00:00:20,344
in our minds that we thought about,

8
00:00:20,384 --> 00:00:22,065
and we wondered what they were thinking late at night,

9
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,006
and maybe they remember that horrible thing

10
00:00:24,046 --> 00:00:24,787
we said to them once.

11
00:00:24,867 --> 00:00:27,548
And we can also remember games where we just didn't have

12
00:00:27,588 --> 00:00:28,789
that attachment to certain characters.

13
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:30,189
We sort of got through the entire game.

14
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,530
and never really felt emotionally attached to any of the characters.

15
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:35,871
So I want to sort of figure out why.

16
00:00:35,931 --> 00:00:36,711
Like why is that?

17
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,492
Why some characters really stick in your mind?

18
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:40,873
And why do some characters just not do that?

19
00:00:41,673 --> 00:00:44,214
So that's what I want to explore in the next 30 or so minutes.

20
00:00:44,954 --> 00:00:47,515
I'm probably going to use most of the 30 minute time,

21
00:00:47,615 --> 00:00:48,875
so we'll have some questions at the end,

22
00:00:48,975 --> 00:00:53,056
but I'll hang out on the overlook after this if you have more questions.

23
00:00:54,302 --> 00:00:58,603
This is something that I have had a lot of experience in my career thinking about and

24
00:00:58,643 --> 00:00:59,083
working on.

25
00:00:59,604 --> 00:01:04,325
A lot of my career was at Telltale Games where I worked on Walking Dead Season 1, 400 Days,

26
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:06,725
the DLC episode, and Season 2.

27
00:01:07,826 --> 00:01:11,086
I was the guy who designed the train puzzle, so for the three of you in here that like

28
00:01:11,126 --> 00:01:12,887
Myst-style adventure game puzzles, you're welcome.

29
00:01:13,347 --> 00:01:14,747
And for everyone else, I'm really sorry.

30
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:19,728
I was also the co-creator and lead designer of Tales from the Borderlands.

31
00:01:21,388 --> 00:01:23,556
So, and now I'm at Hangar 13 Games

32
00:01:23,576 --> 00:01:24,821
where I've been working on Mafia III

33
00:01:24,861 --> 00:01:27,250
and its associated DLC as a world designer.

34
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:31,030
So I've learned some important lessons

35
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,251
that hopefully can sort of help you avoid

36
00:01:33,351 --> 00:01:35,112
undermining your player's ability

37
00:01:35,152 --> 00:01:36,493
to connect with your characters.

38
00:01:37,113 --> 00:01:37,934
I've only got 30 minutes,

39
00:01:37,954 --> 00:01:39,815
so I'm gonna just focus on four specific lessons

40
00:01:39,835 --> 00:01:41,336
that I've learned in my time.

41
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:45,198
Quality time spent, emotional and motivational parody,

42
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:48,500
balancing pragmatism, and depth and specificity.

43
00:01:49,221 --> 00:01:49,741
And for what it's worth,

44
00:01:49,761 --> 00:01:51,362
there's gonna be some spoilers for Walking Dead,

45
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,403
some for Tales from the Borderlands,

46
00:01:53,423 --> 00:01:54,764
and a little bit of Mafia III.

47
00:01:54,784 --> 00:01:56,565
So hopefully you're caught up on those games.

48
00:01:57,781 --> 00:01:59,883
So here's the first big lesson,

49
00:02:00,063 --> 00:02:01,705
and this is the most important lesson, honestly.

50
00:02:02,065 --> 00:02:03,827
In real life, there's no way to force

51
00:02:03,907 --> 00:02:06,570
an immediate emotional connection between two human beings.

52
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,492
That's just not how people work, right?

53
00:02:09,353 --> 00:02:10,634
Digital characters are no different.

54
00:02:11,612 --> 00:02:13,573
Players need to be allowed the space and time

55
00:02:13,613 --> 00:02:16,273
in the game's narrative to build an emotional rapport

56
00:02:16,293 --> 00:02:18,874
with your characters, to slowly, over time,

57
00:02:18,954 --> 00:02:20,614
learn about those characters and learn to love them.

58
00:02:21,294 --> 00:02:25,175
There's no way to cheat or shortcut this, none, okay?

59
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,276
Some game narratives try and shortcut this

60
00:02:27,336 --> 00:02:29,176
by including a previously established,

61
00:02:29,376 --> 00:02:31,497
usually familial relationship,

62
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,537
placing the player in a parental role

63
00:02:34,197 --> 00:02:36,438
or like an older sibling protecting a younger sibling,

64
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:38,478
sometimes sort of jokingly referred to

65
00:02:38,518 --> 00:02:39,979
as the dadification of video games.

66
00:02:41,717 --> 00:02:45,901
But the assumption is that humans care about their in real life family,

67
00:02:46,201 --> 00:02:49,383
so that'll sort of relate one to one with caring about their digital family.

68
00:02:49,844 --> 00:02:51,145
But that never works, right?

69
00:02:51,265 --> 00:02:56,389
Family as a word, as a concept, just sort of describes a relationship

70
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:57,089
that you already have.

71
00:02:57,109 --> 00:02:58,851
It doesn't have any power on its own.

72
00:02:59,191 --> 00:03:01,873
They expect that to sort of impress upon you the need

73
00:03:01,913 --> 00:03:02,894
to care for these characters.

74
00:03:03,234 --> 00:03:05,156
And because your avatar, your character,

75
00:03:05,316 --> 00:03:07,317
cares about your characters, other characters in the game,

76
00:03:07,377 --> 00:03:09,379
doesn't mean that your player is automatically going to.

77
00:03:11,285 --> 00:03:15,928
Additionally, real-life bonds don't just spring to life fully formed like they do in a narrative

78
00:03:15,948 --> 00:03:16,448
that you've written.

79
00:03:16,828 --> 00:03:20,170
Like, when you're born and a baby, you don't immediately love your family.

80
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,711
They take care of you in a very pragmatic way, which I'm going to touch on later in

81
00:03:23,731 --> 00:03:24,131
the talk.

82
00:03:24,472 --> 00:03:29,074
And over time, with emotions, you know, emotional experiences shared with all these people in

83
00:03:29,094 --> 00:03:30,915
your life, you learn to love them over time.

84
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,959
So in The Walking Dead, it was a very specific choice

85
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:38,343
to not make Lee and Clementine be related to each other.

86
00:03:38,784 --> 00:03:40,526
Really early versions of the story

87
00:03:40,626 --> 00:03:42,749
actually had them related with each other,

88
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,793
but we realized that we wanted Lee and the player

89
00:03:46,574 --> 00:03:47,656
to encounter Clementine

90
00:03:47,676 --> 00:03:49,618
under the exact same emotional circumstances.

91
00:03:51,121 --> 00:03:53,925
So neither Lee nor the player know who Clementine is

92
00:03:53,965 --> 00:03:55,968
when they meet her, which means that they go through

93
00:03:55,988 --> 00:03:57,910
the exact same emotional bonding steps

94
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,814
at the exact same time as they grow to appreciate her,

95
00:04:01,135 --> 00:04:03,277
want to protect her, and eventually sort of come to love her.

96
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,360
I call this emotional parody,

97
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,702
and I'll touch on it later in the talk.

98
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,506
The problem comes in is when the player and their avatar

99
00:04:10,546 --> 00:04:12,207
have offset emotional experiences,

100
00:04:12,308 --> 00:04:14,589
such as a character liking another character,

101
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:16,711
or even like being in love with another character,

102
00:04:17,011 --> 00:04:18,812
while your player is a stranger.

103
00:04:19,112 --> 00:04:21,274
They don't understand why their character

104
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:22,214
loves these other characters.

105
00:04:23,455 --> 00:04:24,476
It makes it a lot more difficult

106
00:04:24,496 --> 00:04:25,917
to sort of emotionally merge themselves

107
00:04:25,937 --> 00:04:27,058
with their avatar in the game.

108
00:04:28,634 --> 00:04:31,435
The severity is compounded by how drastic the difference is

109
00:04:31,495 --> 00:04:32,756
between the two emotional states.

110
00:04:33,536 --> 00:04:35,938
Being a stranger as a player and a character,

111
00:04:36,138 --> 00:04:38,579
liking another character, is much less drastic

112
00:04:38,619 --> 00:04:40,480
than a character loving another character

113
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,620
and you being a stranger to them.

114
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:44,522
In these instances, it's really, really important

115
00:04:44,582 --> 00:04:47,743
to spend the time up front to catch the player up

116
00:04:47,783 --> 00:04:50,145
kind of emotionally with where the character is in the game.

117
00:04:52,124 --> 00:04:53,885
So the opening sequence of Tales from the Borderlands,

118
00:04:54,445 --> 00:04:55,846
this actually breaks this rule

119
00:04:56,626 --> 00:04:58,867
because it introduces Rhys with previously

120
00:04:58,907 --> 00:05:02,008
established friends, but it still works

121
00:05:02,088 --> 00:05:03,989
because it immediately spends all of that opening

122
00:05:04,309 --> 00:05:06,450
letting you get to know why he cares

123
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,810
about his friends Vaughn and Yvette.

124
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,351
You get to know their personalities,

125
00:05:09,371 --> 00:05:10,991
you get to know why they're important to Rhys,

126
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:12,552
so you can sort of emotionally catch up

127
00:05:12,572 --> 00:05:14,153
to where Rhys is when you start the game.

128
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:18,502
You very quickly learn that they sort of support him

129
00:05:18,582 --> 00:05:21,283
and thereby the player when he goes through a painful loss,

130
00:05:21,303 --> 00:05:23,825
and they all devise a plan to get revenge

131
00:05:24,185 --> 00:05:25,145
on the villain who caused it.

132
00:05:26,246 --> 00:05:27,886
This allows you to quickly appreciate them

133
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:29,507
on the same level that Rhys does

134
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:31,248
before the game goes really anywhere,

135
00:05:31,268 --> 00:05:33,289
before it takes more than the first few steps.

136
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:34,970
You were there with Rhys.

137
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,611
You saw and experienced that pain firsthand,

138
00:05:37,931 --> 00:05:39,652
which means that you also experience

139
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:42,133
the sort of consolation that his friends give him.

140
00:05:42,153 --> 00:05:43,114
When they're consoling Rhys,

141
00:05:43,394 --> 00:05:44,895
they're also consoling you, the player.

142
00:05:46,634 --> 00:05:48,919
So the big secret really, if you take one take away

143
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:50,783
from this talk is emotional connection

144
00:05:50,823 --> 00:05:52,206
will always take time.

145
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:53,970
That's the big secret.

146
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,634
That's the secret sauce of emotional connection.

147
00:05:56,175 --> 00:05:56,656
Thanks for coming.

148
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,991
So it isn't to say that it must be the same amount.

149
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:06,453
Everybody sort of has, everyone's unique and different

150
00:06:06,473 --> 00:06:07,894
and players will bond to your characters

151
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:09,655
at different speeds over different times.

152
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:11,736
Everyone warms up to real people in real life

153
00:06:11,756 --> 00:06:13,257
at different speeds, so you have to understand

154
00:06:13,277 --> 00:06:14,758
that what happens in the digital world

155
00:06:14,798 --> 00:06:16,580
is exactly the same as what happens in the real world.

156
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,322
It's crucial to give people time to get to know a character,

157
00:06:20,382 --> 00:06:22,383
learn their quirks and their turns of phrase

158
00:06:22,443 --> 00:06:24,765
and little details that they can fall in love with

159
00:06:25,065 --> 00:06:26,286
and give them time to fall in love.

160
00:06:28,571 --> 00:06:30,512
So, we learned this lesson the hard way

161
00:06:31,092 --> 00:06:33,433
when we worked on the Walking Dead DLC episode 400 Days.

162
00:06:33,453 --> 00:06:35,894
If you haven't played it, it's kind of an experiment

163
00:06:35,994 --> 00:06:37,094
in short form storytelling.

164
00:06:37,114 --> 00:06:39,175
It's all centered around a specific location and space

165
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:40,255
over the span of 400 days.

166
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:42,396
The idea was to sort of laser focus

167
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:43,937
on very small specific stories,

168
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,477
give the player just enough time

169
00:06:45,537 --> 00:06:47,198
to emotionally bond with the characters,

170
00:06:47,618 --> 00:06:49,239
make one big emotional decision,

171
00:06:49,299 --> 00:06:50,299
and sort of end the story there.

172
00:06:52,355 --> 00:06:56,179
The problem is that only 20 minutes long is just not enough time to do any of that stuff.

173
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:01,144
It means that we only had 20 minutes to tell a story, we only had a few characters that

174
00:07:01,164 --> 00:07:05,328
we could introduce, which is just not enough vectors of exposure to get to know who your

175
00:07:05,368 --> 00:07:06,008
character is.

176
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:11,714
And a lot of that running time is spent doing the very important tasks of setting up the

177
00:07:11,814 --> 00:07:15,257
characters, getting to know the characters, setting up the specific scenario, like the

178
00:07:15,317 --> 00:07:16,718
choice scenario that you were going to be given.

179
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,281
and then give all of that context.

180
00:07:19,821 --> 00:07:20,842
So we just didn't have enough time

181
00:07:20,862 --> 00:07:22,323
to really get you emotionally invested.

182
00:07:22,884 --> 00:07:26,027
On top of that, players could feel that choice coming,

183
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:27,868
like they played an entire season of The Walking Dead,

184
00:07:27,888 --> 00:07:30,831
they sort of began to predict that emotional crescendo

185
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,492
leading to a big choice moment,

186
00:07:32,993 --> 00:07:34,975
and they knew after completing a few of the stories

187
00:07:34,995 --> 00:07:36,756
that the story was just gonna end right afterwards.

188
00:07:37,176 --> 00:07:39,218
You know, the choices themselves are interesting

189
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:40,720
on a morally academic level,

190
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,162
but the consequences are always more interesting

191
00:07:43,182 --> 00:07:44,443
than the choice, and that kind of goes.

192
00:07:45,437 --> 00:07:47,719
for every narrative game that gives you a choice.

193
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,002
Thinking in your mind what the consequences could be

194
00:07:50,062 --> 00:07:51,304
while that timer is ticking down

195
00:07:51,424 --> 00:07:53,446
is what a telltale game is, is that choice moment,

196
00:07:53,546 --> 00:07:55,889
is where all of that value comes in.

197
00:07:57,654 --> 00:08:00,995
So there just wasn't enough time to get you emotionally invested in these characters or their stories.

198
00:08:01,876 --> 00:08:04,137
So for what it's worth, I'm really still proud of 400 Days.

199
00:08:04,177 --> 00:08:07,998
I think we really came up with some interesting innovations on our way.

200
00:08:08,058 --> 00:08:10,059
We introduced interesting characters and interactivity.

201
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:13,500
I think it's totally worth playing as an experiment and sort of a mental experiment.

202
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,362
But this just comes back to why it's so important to give your players the space

203
00:08:18,422 --> 00:08:20,243
and time to get to know your characters.

204
00:08:21,683 --> 00:08:24,144
I want to add an extremely important supplementary lesson to this,

205
00:08:24,184 --> 00:08:26,805
that not all time spent with a character is created equal.

206
00:08:27,911 --> 00:08:30,533
A player who spends their time sort of sharing experiences

207
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:31,914
with a character will find themselves,

208
00:08:32,895 --> 00:08:35,096
sort of attaching themselves much closer and much faster

209
00:08:35,376 --> 00:08:37,698
than if you just sort of passively occupy the same space

210
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:38,799
in the world as a character.

211
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:41,361
Just like in real life, which is going to be a running talk,

212
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:42,622
a running theme throughout this talk.

213
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,244
is that sharing experience regardless of the emotional flavor,

214
00:08:46,284 --> 00:08:51,685
whether it's sort of sadness, or triumph, or fear, or whatever it is,

215
00:08:52,145 --> 00:08:54,805
it connects you to that character in a very emotionally resonant way.

216
00:08:54,905 --> 00:08:57,166
You have now shared something with this person that you can talk about

217
00:08:57,186 --> 00:09:00,226
that no one else will understand because you were the only two people sharing it.

218
00:09:01,187 --> 00:09:04,367
So, time spent with a character is important, but quality time spent,

219
00:09:05,187 --> 00:09:08,088
sharing an emotional experience, or striving to accomplish something together

220
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:11,288
as a group, or as two or three people, is way more important.

221
00:09:13,872 --> 00:09:16,273
So lesson number two is emotional and motivational parody.

222
00:09:16,413 --> 00:09:18,613
So a player is not their avatar.

223
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,354
We all know that, but it's our jobs

224
00:09:21,434 --> 00:09:23,975
to be as successful as possible at getting them

225
00:09:24,075 --> 00:09:26,855
to feel like they are their avatar as often as possible.

226
00:09:27,435 --> 00:09:29,996
We want them to sort of share the same emotional space

227
00:09:30,116 --> 00:09:32,576
as their character because it makes it a lot easier

228
00:09:32,596 --> 00:09:34,317
for them for just a moment to remember,

229
00:09:34,397 --> 00:09:35,837
to forget that they're not Lievre,

230
00:09:35,857 --> 00:09:37,418
that they're not Reese, that they're not Fiona.

231
00:09:37,698 --> 00:09:38,938
Just for a moment, we want them to think

232
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,078
that they really are that person.

233
00:09:40,698 --> 00:09:41,999
I know it's a really obvious observation,

234
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:43,659
but it's really important for the rest of this point.

235
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:47,540
So back in the early days of video games, motivations were super simple, right?

236
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,641
Stay alive. Kill or be killed. Victory or defeat.

237
00:09:52,181 --> 00:09:55,662
That's all it took to get a player motivated. And survival is a pretty strong

238
00:09:55,702 --> 00:09:59,724
motivator for us as sentient beings. And it's a really clean through line

239
00:09:59,764 --> 00:10:03,665
between what the player's avatar wants, which is to stay alive, and what the player

240
00:10:03,705 --> 00:10:07,466
wants, which is to keep the game experience going and not end and not have to put more

241
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:08,206
quarters in the machine.

242
00:10:09,663 --> 00:10:11,223
I'll go into this in a little bit more detail later,

243
00:10:11,463 --> 00:10:13,484
but for now, remember that a player's motivation

244
00:10:13,504 --> 00:10:16,085
when they first start a game is to do whatever it takes,

245
00:10:16,185 --> 00:10:17,605
whatever the game asks them to do,

246
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:18,986
to continue playing the game

247
00:10:19,306 --> 00:10:21,147
and preventing the game experience from ending.

248
00:10:21,907 --> 00:10:24,728
By the way, this specific motivation is super legitimate

249
00:10:24,768 --> 00:10:26,088
and you just need to take that into account

250
00:10:26,148 --> 00:10:27,349
when you are making a game,

251
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:28,809
that this is not something to discount at all.

252
00:10:30,322 --> 00:10:32,284
So, the introduction of Tales from the Borderlands.

253
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:34,585
You learn about your main character, Rhys.

254
00:10:35,006 --> 00:10:36,587
You see the explicit motivating event

255
00:10:36,627 --> 00:10:38,108
that sets up the rest of the story.

256
00:10:38,989 --> 00:10:40,550
You are expecting a big promotion.

257
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,630
Your friends have helped you get here.

258
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,252
It's been a long slog and you're really excited.

259
00:10:43,272 --> 00:10:44,072
It's promotion time.

260
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:46,274
Except your antagonist, Vasquez,

261
00:10:46,414 --> 00:10:48,475
kills your boss and steals your promotion.

262
00:10:49,256 --> 00:10:52,858
So the shock hits Reese the player at the same time it hits the character.

263
00:10:52,878 --> 00:10:55,980
I'm sorry, yes, it hits the player at the same time it hits the character.

264
00:10:56,521 --> 00:11:00,463
So as Vasquez sits there and continues to belittle you and your character,

265
00:11:00,683 --> 00:11:05,086
your ire and your hate for this character grows at the same time Reese's ire does as well, naturally.

266
00:11:06,192 --> 00:11:08,174
So when the game says, all right, it's a revenge plot,

267
00:11:08,454 --> 00:11:10,515
you and Reese are like, yep, that sounds awesome.

268
00:11:11,036 --> 00:11:12,637
You are in complete sync with your motivations.

269
00:11:12,737 --> 00:11:15,159
You don't need expository dialogue

270
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:16,500
from things that happened off screen.

271
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,101
You don't have to explain motivations.

272
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:19,642
Not only did you see it,

273
00:11:19,842 --> 00:11:22,104
but you experienced it with the main character.

274
00:11:22,324 --> 00:11:24,065
Reese wants revenge, and so do you.

275
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,042
So, it's really important to remember that the avatar

276
00:11:29,102 --> 00:11:31,564
or the main character of the protagonist of the story

277
00:11:31,644 --> 00:11:33,525
and they're written to be interested

278
00:11:33,565 --> 00:11:35,447
in completing the main quest of the story,

279
00:11:35,767 --> 00:11:36,387
to complete the game.

280
00:11:36,668 --> 00:11:38,749
That's because that's what they're written to do, right?

281
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,191
The player initially is not motivated to do that.

282
00:11:41,331 --> 00:11:42,632
They know it's a video game.

283
00:11:42,973 --> 00:11:45,414
They're thinking about, I wanna play this video game

284
00:11:45,434 --> 00:11:46,515
because it's a video game and I spent $60 on it.

285
00:11:48,427 --> 00:11:50,469
And that's completely fine, that's completely okay

286
00:11:50,489 --> 00:11:52,130
because at first you haven't introduced any reason

287
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,491
for them to not just go along

288
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:55,173
with what the game is telling them to do.

289
00:11:56,314 --> 00:11:58,416
However, it's vital to remember that as a game progresses,

290
00:11:58,736 --> 00:12:00,637
you're going to be introducing obstacles,

291
00:12:00,878 --> 00:12:02,259
whether emotional or physical,

292
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:04,741
you're gonna be asking questions of the player,

293
00:12:05,101 --> 00:12:06,162
and every time you do that,

294
00:12:06,683 --> 00:12:08,604
they're gonna reevaluate how they feel

295
00:12:08,684 --> 00:12:10,166
about their motivations and how they feel

296
00:12:10,206 --> 00:12:11,487
about what you're asking them to do.

297
00:12:12,268 --> 00:12:14,149
If their motivation and their avatar's motivation

298
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:15,550
suddenly sort of become separated,

299
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,072
they're going to completely disconnect from the scenario.

300
00:12:20,232 --> 00:12:20,973
So here's an example.

301
00:12:20,993 --> 00:12:23,633
If you tell the player that the avatar wants to save

302
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,354
a loved one from a scary house,

303
00:12:27,075 --> 00:12:28,895
the character's motivation is,

304
00:12:29,035 --> 00:12:30,556
I want to save my loved one from that scary house.

305
00:12:30,576 --> 00:12:32,216
Their motivation is to go all the way to that goal.

306
00:12:32,757 --> 00:12:34,297
The player's motivation might range somewhere from like,

307
00:12:34,317 --> 00:12:35,637
yep, absolutely, let's do that,

308
00:12:35,938 --> 00:12:37,878
to yeah, okay, fine, let's see where this goes.

309
00:12:39,498 --> 00:12:43,140
Regardless of that, there's a sort of emotional inertia made up of a combination of the character's

310
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,762
motivation and the player's motivation that sort of pushes them forward into the story,

311
00:12:46,782 --> 00:12:47,282
into the narrative.

312
00:12:48,522 --> 00:12:52,084
Now, you encounter something scary, and now they're going to reassess.

313
00:12:53,805 --> 00:12:55,366
The avatar's motivation stays the same.

314
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:57,347
I still want to save my loved one from the scary house.

315
00:12:58,427 --> 00:12:59,428
But the player's reevaluated.

316
00:12:59,448 --> 00:13:01,308
They might be like, nope, no way, I'm out, I bail.

317
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:07,002
Now the emotional inertia isn't pulling the players strongly into the game.

318
00:13:07,242 --> 00:13:09,644
It might even be stopped or pulling them away from the experience.

319
00:13:11,105 --> 00:13:13,987
The emotional inertia is a combination of the player and character's motivations, but

320
00:13:14,447 --> 00:13:16,769
the player's motivation is always going to trump everything because it's real.

321
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:20,371
And this is where you get into experiences where you are playing a game and you're like,

322
00:13:20,471 --> 00:13:21,152
why would I do that?

323
00:13:21,192 --> 00:13:22,072
This seems really stupid.

324
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,793
I'm going to a haunted house, why don't I just call the police?

325
00:13:23,813 --> 00:13:24,574
This seems really dumb.

326
00:13:24,594 --> 00:13:25,535
My avatar is really dumb.

327
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,211
So, emotional and motivational parity.

328
00:13:30,732 --> 00:13:32,433
Remember, you need to keep the player and the avatar

329
00:13:32,453 --> 00:13:34,355
as emotional states and motivations in sync

330
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,295
as often as possible.

331
00:13:36,096 --> 00:13:38,358
It feels risky to spend the first 10 minutes

332
00:13:38,478 --> 00:13:40,880
of an opening sequence of a Borderlands game just talking.

333
00:13:41,401 --> 00:13:42,401
You have to take that risk.

334
00:13:42,482 --> 00:13:43,402
It's super important.

335
00:13:43,502 --> 00:13:45,184
You will not regret it, and you will if you don't.

336
00:13:46,545 --> 00:13:48,427
And be aware when your game is asking the player

337
00:13:48,447 --> 00:13:50,789
to make a judgment call or puts an obstacle in their way

338
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:52,170
that's gonna make them reevaluate

339
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,171
their emotional attachment to what you're asking them to do.

340
00:14:00,545 --> 00:14:02,046
The next lesson is balancing pragmatism.

341
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,569
So earlier I mentioned at the start of the game,

342
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:08,353
players are sort of focused purely

343
00:14:08,674 --> 00:14:11,196
on a purely pragmatic task of ensuring

344
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:12,538
that the game experience continues.

345
00:14:13,439 --> 00:14:14,520
To that end, they're gonna make choices

346
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,961
based on those pragmatic needs alone.

347
00:14:17,372 --> 00:14:19,534
So we as game developers have been sort of taught

348
00:14:19,654 --> 00:14:21,836
and rightly to think of our characters as,

349
00:14:22,316 --> 00:14:23,577
you know, we don't want to objectify them

350
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:25,239
as abstract game mechanics and flow charts

351
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,399
and state machines and stuff like that.

352
00:14:26,439 --> 00:14:28,681
We really want to imbue them with life and personality

353
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,962
and hide their artificial nature

354
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,524
and allow the player for the moment

355
00:14:31,544 --> 00:14:34,506
just to believe that they're real people, right?

356
00:14:34,806 --> 00:14:36,467
But I argue that it's really important

357
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:39,310
to allow the player to begin the player's relationship

358
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,172
with a character by leveraging their mechanical value

359
00:14:42,472 --> 00:14:44,013
because this immediately builds

360
00:14:44,053 --> 00:14:45,435
initial pragmatic investment.

361
00:14:46,749 --> 00:14:48,311
Now, I'm not saying that you should stop there.

362
00:14:49,713 --> 00:14:51,456
Pragmatic value alone is a really shallow

363
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:52,378
kind of investment.

364
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:54,421
It gives you a lot up front but doesn't last.

365
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:57,005
But it can much more easily transition that player

366
00:14:57,085 --> 00:14:58,848
into a deep kind of emotional attachment

367
00:14:58,888 --> 00:14:59,509
that we're looking for.

368
00:15:01,008 --> 00:15:02,509
So I'm sure you, if played Walking Dead,

369
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:04,371
you know the Doug Carley choice at the end of episode one.

370
00:15:05,131 --> 00:15:06,732
But if you don't, at the end of the first episode,

371
00:15:06,752 --> 00:15:08,134
you're forced to choose between

372
00:15:08,154 --> 00:15:09,575
which of these two characters you wanna save.

373
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:11,736
You can only save one,

374
00:15:11,797 --> 00:15:14,058
and the game has sort of tutorialized at this point

375
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:15,099
that your choices are permanent

376
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:16,180
and there's gonna be consequences

377
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,222
that are gonna last for a while based on this choice.

378
00:15:18,882 --> 00:15:20,964
So you understand the gravity of your choice at this point.

379
00:15:23,105 --> 00:15:26,208
So at this point, you haven't really had a ton of time

380
00:15:26,228 --> 00:15:27,869
to emotionally invest in these characters.

381
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:29,671
You just kind of met them like half an hour ago,

382
00:15:29,951 --> 00:15:30,372
20 minutes ago.

383
00:15:30,672 --> 00:15:32,353
You might have a beginning of an emotional investment,

384
00:15:32,393 --> 00:15:32,934
but for the most part,

385
00:15:32,954 --> 00:15:34,575
you don't have tons of emotional investment,

386
00:15:34,856 --> 00:15:36,877
but this moment is super, super resonant.

387
00:15:37,418 --> 00:15:37,938
Why is that?

388
00:15:38,999 --> 00:15:40,861
Well, it works because you've only spent

389
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:42,482
some short amount of time with these characters,

390
00:15:42,582 --> 00:15:45,125
but you've also gotten a ton of pragmatic reasons

391
00:15:45,165 --> 00:15:46,366
to keep either of them alive,

392
00:15:46,726 --> 00:15:48,828
which sort of feeds into an overall investment

393
00:15:49,128 --> 00:15:50,049
of either of those characters.

394
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,251
The first time you meet Carly, she's saving her life by shooting a bunch of attacking

395
00:15:54,271 --> 00:15:58,773
zombies and she also proves that she's trustworthy because she knows Lee Everett's, the main

396
00:15:58,813 --> 00:16:01,894
character's, secret, who is a convicted murderer and she hasn't told anyone.

397
00:16:01,914 --> 00:16:02,995
She agrees to not tell anyone.

398
00:16:03,915 --> 00:16:07,517
Doug solves problems and shows how resourceful he can be by sort of helping build and fix

399
00:16:07,557 --> 00:16:07,817
things.

400
00:16:08,237 --> 00:16:11,018
He's also shown that he's willing to put himself in danger to protect other people.

401
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:15,046
So all these elements provide strong pragmatic reasons

402
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:16,607
for the player to keep either character alive.

403
00:16:16,947 --> 00:16:19,089
During the choice moment, the player might ask themselves,

404
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:21,071
which character do I emotionally like more?

405
00:16:21,391 --> 00:16:23,053
But for the most part, they're gonna weigh

406
00:16:23,353 --> 00:16:25,895
the continued pragmatic value of each of their character

407
00:16:25,975 --> 00:16:27,717
against their survival of their avatar,

408
00:16:27,997 --> 00:16:29,879
and therefore the continuation of the game experience.

409
00:16:34,267 --> 00:16:36,028
The majority of early emotional investment

410
00:16:36,068 --> 00:16:38,190
is sort of calculated by players trying to figure out

411
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,691
which choice gives them the best chance of winning the game,

412
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,353
even emotional and sort of like narrative game

413
00:16:42,393 --> 00:16:44,134
like Tales or Walking Dead.

414
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:47,036
As you can see, 80% of people chose Carly

415
00:16:47,056 --> 00:16:48,016
and 20% chose Doug.

416
00:16:48,977 --> 00:16:52,139
And this is just because the gun was so overwhelmingly

417
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:54,440
powerful in a game about zombies, funny.

418
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:56,902
And Doug was more of just a promise,

419
00:16:56,962 --> 00:16:58,603
like he might protect you in the future,

420
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,704
but there's nothing like hard

421
00:16:59,724 --> 00:17:02,005
to really pragmatically invest in there, it was a promise.

422
00:17:04,372 --> 00:17:07,493
It's also important to recognize that even though the choice itself is super pragmatic,

423
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,714
the outcome is super, super emotional.

424
00:17:09,774 --> 00:17:13,295
It's that emotional connection that I was talking about earlier where the player and

425
00:17:13,315 --> 00:17:17,217
their avatar and this character you've chosen to save have all now shared that quality time,

426
00:17:17,257 --> 00:17:18,937
that emotional moment together.

427
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:22,879
It's an extremely potent moment after the choice.

428
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:26,240
At the end of Walking Dead episode one, they ask you, why did you save me?

429
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,001
Why did you do that?

430
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:30,522
And you have moments with them that sort of connect over this shared experience.

431
00:17:31,806 --> 00:17:33,487
If you didn't feel a bond with either of those characters

432
00:17:33,507 --> 00:17:35,387
before that, you certainly start to feel one now.

433
00:17:38,008 --> 00:17:39,429
All players are gonna bond at different speeds

434
00:17:39,469 --> 00:17:40,929
and to different degrees of intensity.

435
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:43,270
So pragmatic value can sort of help support

436
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,391
or reinforce weaker emotional attachment

437
00:17:45,591 --> 00:17:46,491
to a specific character.

438
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:50,013
By starting a sort of player like farther along

439
00:17:50,053 --> 00:17:52,194
the investment ladder by just adding pragmatic reasons,

440
00:17:52,534 --> 00:17:55,395
you sort of can help speed up how long it takes them

441
00:17:55,435 --> 00:17:56,915
to emotionally attach to that character as well.

442
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:00,180
So there's also another use for this kind

443
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:00,981
of pragmatic balance.

444
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:03,743
Once the player has had enough time to form emotional bonds,

445
00:18:04,264 --> 00:18:06,706
you can actually force them to make emotional decisions

446
00:18:06,806 --> 00:18:08,067
against their own pragmatism.

447
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:12,311
It's a really interesting way to mix up the things

448
00:18:12,331 --> 00:18:13,172
that your player cares about.

449
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,021
So here's an early idea.

450
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:16,942
I had an early idea for Tales from the Borderlands.

451
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,203
We were gonna get unlockable weapons.

452
00:18:18,283 --> 00:18:19,984
So when you played Tales from the Borderlands,

453
00:18:20,405 --> 00:18:21,786
you could unlock certain weapons,

454
00:18:21,806 --> 00:18:22,646
you could put them in Borderlands 2,

455
00:18:22,826 --> 00:18:24,407
and you'd have like a unique gun or whatever.

456
00:18:25,448 --> 00:18:26,949
And my design was to actually tie them

457
00:18:26,969 --> 00:18:28,110
to specific choices that you made

458
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,251
within Tales from the Borderlands.

459
00:18:29,932 --> 00:18:31,813
So for example, you have a friendly character,

460
00:18:31,893 --> 00:18:34,295
you can choose to help him and save his life or he dies.

461
00:18:34,835 --> 00:18:36,697
If he dies, you get a sweet shotgun

462
00:18:36,717 --> 00:18:38,098
you can play around in Borderlands 2 with,

463
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:39,038
but if he lives, you get nothing.

464
00:18:40,437 --> 00:18:42,338
And your friend's alive, and you have to decide,

465
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:43,478
what is more important to me?

466
00:18:43,678 --> 00:18:45,859
Is it the emotional value of my friend,

467
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,860
or is it the mechanical value of this shotgun?

468
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,461
What's more, every single time you played

469
00:18:51,501 --> 00:18:52,281
with that gun in Borderlands 2,

470
00:18:52,321 --> 00:18:53,702
you just had to see your dead friend's face.

471
00:18:55,002 --> 00:18:56,443
And you had to live with that decision forever.

472
00:18:56,563 --> 00:18:58,764
And everyone in the game would know what you had to do

473
00:18:59,084 --> 00:18:59,984
to get that shotgun.

474
00:19:00,004 --> 00:19:02,325
You had to be a jerk who let their friend die

475
00:19:02,505 --> 00:19:03,105
to have the shotgun.

476
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,626
You just be reminded of the choice you made

477
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:05,226
over and over again.

478
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:10,085
So this got scoped out of the game for a number of reasons, but it might sound familiar to

479
00:19:10,105 --> 00:19:13,166
a few of you who've played Mafia III because completely independent of me, this system

480
00:19:13,206 --> 00:19:16,788
was sort of designed into Mafia III within the sit-downs mechanic.

481
00:19:17,548 --> 00:19:21,930
So in Mafia III, when you complete your takeover of a specific district, a specific piece of

482
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:26,332
the world map, you sit down with your three lieutenants, who are all criminals, and you

483
00:19:26,352 --> 00:19:28,133
decide who you're going to parcel out to.

484
00:19:28,993 --> 00:19:31,473
And all the sort of mechanical rewards in the game,

485
00:19:31,533 --> 00:19:33,694
all your sort of tech trees are locked behind this mechanic.

486
00:19:33,754 --> 00:19:35,394
So each character has their own tech tree.

487
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:36,634
One of them might give you a better gun,

488
00:19:36,994 --> 00:19:38,415
another might give you a faster car,

489
00:19:38,735 --> 00:19:40,515
or explosives, or that kind of thing.

490
00:19:41,415 --> 00:19:43,516
So if you want to dive deep into one character's tech tree,

491
00:19:43,756 --> 00:19:45,576
you had to give them a disproportionately larger

492
00:19:45,636 --> 00:19:48,217
amount of property, which eventually would piss off

493
00:19:48,717 --> 00:19:49,937
the guy who got the least property,

494
00:19:49,997 --> 00:19:51,057
and he will actually turn on you,

495
00:19:51,117 --> 00:19:51,837
and you have to fight them.

496
00:19:51,897 --> 00:19:53,738
And it's the whole thing where all of that property

497
00:19:53,778 --> 00:19:54,098
goes away.

498
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:58,169
What was really interesting though is that 63% of people

499
00:19:58,189 --> 00:20:00,150
did anything it took to keep everyone happy,

500
00:20:01,671 --> 00:20:03,032
which is really, really interesting

501
00:20:03,092 --> 00:20:05,173
because this is a super systems-heavy game

502
00:20:05,253 --> 00:20:07,714
and you get a really, really tangible mechanical benefit

503
00:20:08,215 --> 00:20:09,575
for basically screwing somebody over

504
00:20:09,615 --> 00:20:11,396
to get a super rad sniper rifle

505
00:20:11,517 --> 00:20:13,258
or crazy explosives or whatever,

506
00:20:13,358 --> 00:20:15,859
but it was more important for them emotionally

507
00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:17,000
to keep all their friends happy

508
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,841
than to get a super, super tangible mechanical benefit.

509
00:20:21,008 --> 00:20:22,590
which is really interesting and just goes to show

510
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,231
how super hard it is to balance

511
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:26,052
pragmatic versus emotional choices.

512
00:20:27,654 --> 00:20:29,115
If you're interested in how the system was built,

513
00:20:29,135 --> 00:20:31,917
there's a talk tomorrow, 11.30, it's an hour talk

514
00:20:32,217 --> 00:20:34,819
by a really talented systems designer, Remy,

515
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:37,061
who's gonna be doing a talk about how all this stuff

516
00:20:37,081 --> 00:20:38,042
was made, so if you're interested in that,

517
00:20:38,062 --> 00:20:38,722
you should definitely go to that.

518
00:20:40,975 --> 00:20:42,115
So, balancing pragmatism.

519
00:20:42,176 --> 00:20:45,338
Remember, there is value in allowing players

520
00:20:45,358 --> 00:20:46,939
to find mechanical value in characters.

521
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,940
It doesn't overwrite emotional value.

522
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,341
Over time, their emotional value will sort of like,

523
00:20:51,642 --> 00:20:53,042
supplant the pragmatic value,

524
00:20:53,303 --> 00:20:55,624
and the pragmatic value is much less important,

525
00:20:55,984 --> 00:20:58,066
but the pragmatic value can help you get in

526
00:20:58,086 --> 00:20:59,406
in the front door earlier.

527
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:01,728
And give your players opportunities

528
00:21:01,748 --> 00:21:03,109
to weigh pragmatic versus emotional.

529
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,971
Okay, so the last lesson is depth and specificity.

530
00:21:08,221 --> 00:21:10,644
So, the more specific a character's personality is,

531
00:21:10,684 --> 00:21:12,407
the more believable they are as a person.

532
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,052
Everyone knows someone who has a quick temper

533
00:21:16,132 --> 00:21:18,095
or says, sort of, accidentally says the wrong thing

534
00:21:18,135 --> 00:21:20,779
at the wrong time, or is addicted to 18th century

535
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:22,081
Victorian architecture, or whatever.

536
00:21:23,475 --> 00:21:26,476
uh... real people are impossibly very unique and you need to allow your

537
00:21:26,496 --> 00:21:29,818
characters that same luxury because it allows players to find those little

538
00:21:29,838 --> 00:21:31,798
endearing qualities that they can really fall in love with

539
00:21:32,238 --> 00:21:35,900
i mean think about excom or a game like excom for example where all you can do is

540
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,040
you can just name your soldiers

541
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,301
but think about how much more emotional investment you have in those soldiers once you name them

542
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:42,342
after your family or friends or you just name them anything

543
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:45,843
that's just the tip of the iceberg that's just a name like that's how much you get from

544
00:21:45,903 --> 00:21:46,303
just that

545
00:21:47,452 --> 00:21:51,072
So, as mentioned earlier, as a player gets to spend more time with Doug or Carly after

546
00:21:51,092 --> 00:21:54,033
they make their choice, you get to spend time getting to know them.

547
00:21:54,053 --> 00:21:58,114
You get to learn little quirks about their personality, like Carly was a correspondent,

548
00:21:58,134 --> 00:22:01,295
a news correspondent in War Zones, and Doug likes to make robots in his spare time.

549
00:22:01,775 --> 00:22:06,336
These are little details that can flesh out a character and let players have another sort

550
00:22:06,356 --> 00:22:07,497
of avenue to connect with them.

551
00:22:08,853 --> 00:22:10,614
The most memorable, cherished, and beloved characters

552
00:22:10,654 --> 00:22:11,975
tend to be the ones with the most specificity

553
00:22:12,015 --> 00:22:12,776
written into them.

554
00:22:13,516 --> 00:22:16,157
But that specificity should not come from dialogue alone.

555
00:22:16,177 --> 00:22:17,718
It has to come from their actions as well.

556
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,820
For example, Kenny from The Walking Dead

557
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,241
can tell you all day that he's a fisherman

558
00:22:22,281 --> 00:22:23,481
and give you his backstory.

559
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:25,823
But what you really learn from his actions

560
00:22:25,963 --> 00:22:27,183
is that he's really short-tempered,

561
00:22:27,684 --> 00:22:29,265
but he's really loyal to his friends,

562
00:22:29,645 --> 00:22:31,206
and that he'll do anything to protect his family.

563
00:22:31,406 --> 00:22:32,606
He never tells you those things,

564
00:22:33,147 --> 00:22:34,928
but he definitely shows you them through his actions.

565
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:40,366
So I don't mean the quantitative depth of their backstory,

566
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:43,026
but just the amount of unique traits or quirks

567
00:22:43,106 --> 00:22:45,427
or turns of phrase that really flesh a character out

568
00:22:45,467 --> 00:22:47,007
to be more of a full person.

569
00:22:48,548 --> 00:22:50,368
Like, Reese idolizes Handsome Jack,

570
00:22:50,888 --> 00:22:52,908
or Sasha despises the Hyperion Corporation,

571
00:22:52,948 --> 00:22:54,749
but sort of is curious about what that life is like,

572
00:22:55,289 --> 00:22:57,229
or Lily loves her absolutely awful father.

573
00:22:57,969 --> 00:22:58,249
Why?

574
00:22:58,269 --> 00:22:59,650
It makes you ask, why?

575
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,890
Why do the characters do these things?

576
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,210
Why do they feel these way?

577
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,391
What is it about them that makes them this way?

578
00:23:04,671 --> 00:23:06,211
It makes you wanna dive in and learn more about them.

579
00:23:07,778 --> 00:23:09,418
It's also super important to be careful

580
00:23:09,438 --> 00:23:11,039
where you place these moments of narrative,

581
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:13,660
you know, these character depth in a larger narrative

582
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,861
without them being sort of introduced apropos of nothing

583
00:23:15,901 --> 00:23:17,982
or in ignoring the tone of the scene as a whole.

584
00:23:20,883 --> 00:23:22,783
Yeah, I've seen this actually happen in games before.

585
00:23:24,024 --> 00:23:26,004
No scene is worth a line or exchange.

586
00:23:26,425 --> 00:23:27,845
So just save them for where you get

587
00:23:27,885 --> 00:23:28,705
the most bang for your buck.

588
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:32,787
So while adding this detail to your characters,

589
00:23:32,827 --> 00:23:34,648
remember that it's important to allow your characters

590
00:23:34,668 --> 00:23:36,328
to have flaws and have weaknesses.

591
00:23:37,085 --> 00:23:37,706
and make mistakes.

592
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,788
Power fantasy is not emotionally deep on its own.

593
00:23:40,868 --> 00:23:42,549
It's fun, but it's not emotionally deep.

594
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,471
It limits the amount of emotional investment

595
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:47,552
a player can feel if their character only has good traits.

596
00:23:48,133 --> 00:23:49,494
I mean, how can you empathize with a character

597
00:23:49,514 --> 00:23:52,476
who doesn't feel rage or loss or sadness or defeat?

598
00:23:53,076 --> 00:23:54,417
We feel empathy for these characters

599
00:23:54,457 --> 00:23:55,858
because we too know what it feels like

600
00:23:55,878 --> 00:23:57,339
to want something and never get it.

601
00:23:59,661 --> 00:24:03,542
Lee is not the leader of the group of survivors in The Walking Dead for a long while because

602
00:24:04,063 --> 00:24:07,064
there was a very specific reason for that, which was allowing the player's avatar to

603
00:24:07,144 --> 00:24:10,745
— the power to dictate the sort of goals of the game goes in direct opposition to the

604
00:24:10,885 --> 00:24:13,346
tone of the narrative, the specific goal of the narrative.

605
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:18,028
In addition, giving the player that much control is way less narratively interesting than forcing

606
00:24:18,048 --> 00:24:19,528
them to make difficult decisions.

607
00:24:21,255 --> 00:24:23,216
So here's an extreme example, but I'll make it anyway.

608
00:24:23,517 --> 00:24:25,558
In Walking Dead episode two, season one, two,

609
00:24:26,459 --> 00:24:29,281
you have to choose how much or who gets to eat.

610
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,143
There's four pieces of food and like seven or eight

611
00:24:31,163 --> 00:24:32,204
or nine people in your group.

612
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:35,026
So you need to choose out of those people who gets to eat.

613
00:24:35,527 --> 00:24:38,249
Spread across all players, it went down this way, right?

614
00:24:38,589 --> 00:24:40,851
Clementine was first, obviously, and then Duck.

615
00:24:41,432 --> 00:24:42,032
So the two kids.

616
00:24:42,653 --> 00:24:44,554
Number three was Mark, who was a new character

617
00:24:44,574 --> 00:24:46,576
who was just introduced 15 minutes ago.

618
00:24:46,616 --> 00:24:47,477
You knew nothing about him.

619
00:24:47,817 --> 00:24:48,898
And number four is Larry.

620
00:24:49,975 --> 00:24:51,915
Larry is a racist old man who hates you.

621
00:24:51,975 --> 00:24:53,296
He's never been nice to you once.

622
00:24:53,316 --> 00:24:54,776
So like, why is that?

623
00:24:54,836 --> 00:24:57,077
Why, like people don't like Larry,

624
00:24:57,117 --> 00:24:59,597
but they want to get to know him, right?

625
00:24:59,717 --> 00:25:02,498
It's, the two kids are clearly not at all pragmatic choices

626
00:25:02,578 --> 00:25:04,379
as far as like the pragmatic versus emotional goes.

627
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,759
They're not helpful to the group.

628
00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:07,459
They can't really protect anyone,

629
00:25:07,479 --> 00:25:09,640
but they're a very easy emotional choice.

630
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,020
You protect the innocence, right?

631
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,321
Mark is a complete vacuum of information.

632
00:25:13,381 --> 00:25:15,842
So the player's curiosity sort of leads them to him.

633
00:25:17,345 --> 00:25:20,369
And Larry, well, people want to understand him.

634
00:25:20,509 --> 00:25:21,651
People want to know what his deal is,

635
00:25:21,711 --> 00:25:23,093
like why is he the way that he is.

636
00:25:23,894 --> 00:25:25,015
They want to maybe change his mind.

637
00:25:25,035 --> 00:25:26,958
They know he's not a nice character,

638
00:25:26,998 --> 00:25:28,480
but he's got enough depth to his character

639
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,402
that people want to sort of understand him.

640
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:33,137
On the other side of the coin, it can be just as valuable

641
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:35,159
to leave intentional empty space about your character.

642
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,801
Not mentioning specific things

643
00:25:36,821 --> 00:25:38,102
that aren't sort of narratively important

644
00:25:38,502 --> 00:25:39,644
allows players to speculate

645
00:25:39,664 --> 00:25:41,105
and fill in missing information themselves.

646
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:42,967
It gives them a feeling of mutual ownership

647
00:25:43,087 --> 00:25:43,747
over the character.

648
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:45,349
This is where sort of headcanons and fan theories

649
00:25:45,389 --> 00:25:45,889
and stuff like that.

650
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,431
It's an extremely easy and good way

651
00:25:47,451 --> 00:25:49,593
to give players their own ownership over the characters.

652
00:25:50,354 --> 00:25:52,716
Remember, players will always imprint what they want

653
00:25:52,796 --> 00:25:54,777
on your characters, regardless of what you want,

654
00:25:55,838 --> 00:25:57,740
and that's a super easy way to leverage that,

655
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,682
because it's just gonna let the players

656
00:25:59,702 --> 00:26:01,724
sort of see themselves reflected back in those characters.

657
00:26:03,705 --> 00:26:05,127
So, I've run through a ton of stuff.

658
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:06,087
Let's wrap up really quickly.

659
00:26:06,828 --> 00:26:08,670
Time spent together is a prerequisite

660
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:09,590
for emotional connection.

661
00:26:10,471 --> 00:26:12,233
Time spent sharing an emotional experience

662
00:26:12,713 --> 00:26:13,874
or striving to accomplish a goal

663
00:26:13,934 --> 00:26:15,436
is the most valuable time spent.

664
00:26:16,514 --> 00:26:17,955
Pre-established emotional connections

665
00:26:18,015 --> 00:26:19,936
do not shortcut the player into caring earlier.

666
00:26:20,356 --> 00:26:21,577
It can actually have the opposite effect

667
00:26:21,617 --> 00:26:22,858
because their character and them

668
00:26:22,898 --> 00:26:24,139
have a very different emotional place.

669
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,481
Your player and their character should have emotional parity

670
00:26:27,521 --> 00:26:29,902
to ensure that the inertia moves them forward, not backwards.

671
00:26:30,703 --> 00:26:32,564
If your character has previously established relationships,

672
00:26:32,604 --> 00:26:34,505
spend the time to emotionally catch the player up.

673
00:26:35,506 --> 00:26:36,507
Spend the time to let your player

674
00:26:36,547 --> 00:26:38,988
build the same primary motivations as the character.

675
00:26:39,008 --> 00:26:40,229
Let them experience the events

676
00:26:40,629 --> 00:26:42,430
that kick off the story together, if you can.

677
00:26:44,273 --> 00:26:46,475
Give players pragmatic reasons to invest on the ground floor.

678
00:26:47,435 --> 00:26:49,096
Start with pragmatism, but don't stop there.

679
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,097
It's really short term.

680
00:26:51,497 --> 00:26:53,338
Try and find opportunities to force your player

681
00:26:53,418 --> 00:26:54,879
to choose between their emotional attachment

682
00:26:54,899 --> 00:26:55,800
and their pragmatic needs.

683
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:00,022
Weaknesses and flaws make a character more relatable.

684
00:27:00,042 --> 00:27:00,702
They are relatable.

685
00:27:01,242 --> 00:27:02,583
Ensure that moments of character exploration

686
00:27:02,643 --> 00:27:03,884
fit the tone and the intent of the scene.

687
00:27:03,944 --> 00:27:04,744
Don't shoehorn them in.

688
00:27:05,545 --> 00:27:07,306
Leave undefined space in a character

689
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:08,906
to allow players to see themselves in them.

690
00:27:09,907 --> 00:27:11,888
And focus on what the characters are feeling

691
00:27:11,948 --> 00:27:13,729
and how they're reacting over their backstory.

692
00:27:16,353 --> 00:27:16,973
Thank you very much.

693
00:27:28,036 --> 00:27:30,076
So I think we have time for a few questions.

694
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:33,937
And again, I'll hop over to the overlook afterwards if you guys just didn't get a chance to ask

695
00:27:33,957 --> 00:27:34,497
your question.

696
00:27:34,917 --> 00:27:37,098
So feel free to step up to the mic and ask some questions.

697
00:27:39,168 --> 00:27:48,011
Hello. I was really interested in what you were saying about pragmatics leading up to

698
00:27:48,851 --> 00:27:55,213
more emotional connections later on. What can you say about pragmatic elements of the

699
00:27:55,253 --> 00:28:03,976
character coloring the story that the characters place on top of them? For example, a bodyguard

700
00:28:04,576 --> 00:28:08,197
who isn't actually very pragmatically good.

701
00:28:08,992 --> 00:28:11,473
and you're sort of like, you're bad at your job.

702
00:28:11,634 --> 00:28:17,116
You know, like, where it's coloring the emotional situation

703
00:28:17,156 --> 00:28:18,657
to the point where you're like,

704
00:28:18,677 --> 00:28:19,798
well, this guy's just a joke.

705
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:20,298
Right.

706
00:28:20,418 --> 00:28:21,599
Or something along those lines.

707
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:24,960
I think that if he's pragmatically bad at his job,

708
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,682
by pragmatics I mean like mechanical value,

709
00:28:27,782 --> 00:28:29,142
like in the game, like he's a swordsman,

710
00:28:29,162 --> 00:28:30,483
he's a magic user, that kind of stuff.

711
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:33,304
And if he's a bad character pragmatically,

712
00:28:33,324 --> 00:28:35,866
that's going to make it a lot tougher to emotionally, like.

713
00:28:36,606 --> 00:28:39,347
you know fire like the fire mobile game i want to crack the characters but i

714
00:28:39,387 --> 00:28:41,969
like them anyway because they're cool but i'm not an easy battle i just don't

715
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:45,150
do that because it's a game first and foremost it's a game of its mechanical

716
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,231
mechanics heavy game

717
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:49,313
But again, like Walking Dead,

718
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:50,434
it's not a mechanics heavy game.

719
00:28:50,474 --> 00:28:52,795
So like the pragmatic value still had a lot of weight

720
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:53,496
in that moment.

721
00:28:54,236 --> 00:28:55,477
But I think it's important to remember

722
00:28:55,517 --> 00:28:57,579
that the pragmatic value,

723
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:59,320
if there's like a negative pragmatic value

724
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,381
or they're like a liability,

725
00:29:00,441 --> 00:29:01,742
like Ben was in the Walking Dead,

726
00:29:02,202 --> 00:29:03,763
it's gonna really hamper how much you can care

727
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:04,344
about that character.

728
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,524
You can empathize with them.

729
00:29:05,564 --> 00:29:06,785
Like a lot of people empathize with Ben,

730
00:29:06,805 --> 00:29:07,526
but they didn't like him.

731
00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:08,386
They didn't want him around.

732
00:29:09,067 --> 00:29:10,568
They dumped him the first chance they got

733
00:29:10,588 --> 00:29:11,148
for the most part.

734
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:14,051
So like you have to be careful of sort of shooting yourself

735
00:29:14,091 --> 00:29:16,052
in the knee with negative pragmatic value.

736
00:29:17,153 --> 00:29:18,873
I would ensure that if he's not good at his job,

737
00:29:18,893 --> 00:29:20,454
he has some other pragmatic value.

738
00:29:21,154 --> 00:29:22,475
Like he's like a historian,

739
00:29:22,495 --> 00:29:23,635
he knows a lot of stuff about something.

740
00:29:23,675 --> 00:29:25,996
Like he's got something, some core that he's got use,

741
00:29:26,136 --> 00:29:26,876
he's got some sort of use,

742
00:29:26,917 --> 00:29:29,157
if he's not his primary profession or something.

743
00:29:29,438 --> 00:29:29,678
Thank you.

744
00:29:29,898 --> 00:29:29,978
Yep.

745
00:29:32,008 --> 00:29:32,928
Hey, thanks, great talk.

746
00:29:33,028 --> 00:29:33,288
Thank you.

747
00:29:33,889 --> 00:29:37,810
I'm working on Spy Party, which has got a ton of characters in it, but no linear narrative,

748
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:41,272
and I'm wondering if you've thought about stuff, like, I mean, one of the things I liked

749
00:29:41,292 --> 00:29:43,873
about your talk was it was very concrete in terms of, like, here's some advice about,

750
00:29:43,893 --> 00:29:46,554
you know, these specific things, but a lot of them tied into, like, you're going to have

751
00:29:46,594 --> 00:29:47,975
time with these characters in an emotional way.

752
00:29:48,295 --> 00:29:51,096
So a game like TF2 or Overwatch or things like that, can you, have you thought about

753
00:29:51,136 --> 00:29:54,518
how character development and, and, like, kind of emotional attachment works in those

754
00:29:54,538 --> 00:29:54,758
games?

755
00:29:55,032 --> 00:29:56,033
Yeah, it's definitely different.

756
00:29:56,874 --> 00:29:58,196
And I don't have experience making those games,

757
00:29:58,216 --> 00:29:59,237
so I can't speak to experience,

758
00:29:59,257 --> 00:30:02,222
but I think about stuff a lot.

759
00:30:02,582 --> 00:30:03,944
Time spent still counts as just like.

760
00:30:05,335 --> 00:30:07,476
I play a ton of games with a specific Overwatch character,

761
00:30:07,496 --> 00:30:08,997
and I feel emotionally connected to that character,

762
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:11,058
and I love his little turns of phrase,

763
00:30:11,118 --> 00:30:12,098
and I love his little, like,

764
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:13,899
Torbjorn's camera's closer to the ground.

765
00:30:13,939 --> 00:30:15,080
Like, I love that the first time I saw it.

766
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:15,800
Like, just stuff like that,

767
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,462
that's just detail that is lovable,

768
00:30:18,862 --> 00:30:21,263
and they have tons of characters.

769
00:30:21,283 --> 00:30:25,025
So, I don't know, like, even like rounds spent in a game

770
00:30:25,405 --> 00:30:27,166
still counts as time spent with a character.

771
00:30:27,186 --> 00:30:29,007
So I don't think you need to have an overarching narrative

772
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:30,328
in those instances,

773
00:30:30,368 --> 00:30:32,689
because you can just care for those characters.

774
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:37,735
purely because you are them or you're around them and they have interesting things to say

775
00:30:37,755 --> 00:30:41,138
and you get to know like I wish there was a way in overwatch for me to just

776
00:30:41,699 --> 00:30:44,522
Talk to the characters and ask them questions about themselves or just like even just like

777
00:30:45,538 --> 00:30:50,382
espouse more of their backstories and interests and cares and loves like in their barks, which

778
00:30:50,402 --> 00:30:50,962
they kind of do.

779
00:30:51,563 --> 00:30:55,706
But yeah, I think that that kind of thing is it's just, it's just like inch by inch,

780
00:30:55,886 --> 00:30:56,987
you gain the yard.

781
00:30:57,007 --> 00:31:01,430
And you can get that emotional investment over time if you just give players time to

782
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:04,332
spend with those characters and give them interesting ways to get their personality

783
00:31:04,392 --> 00:31:04,952
to the player.

784
00:31:04,972 --> 00:31:05,853
Cool.

785
00:31:06,393 --> 00:31:06,553
Thanks.

786
00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:13,572
Hello. Oh. Well, thank you for the talk. It was very interesting. So, all of these apply

787
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:21,255
to non-player characters, but have you any advice on how to use this with your player

788
00:31:21,295 --> 00:31:27,077
characters? Because, you know, for me at least, the fact that I'm in their shoes doesn't always

789
00:31:27,157 --> 00:31:32,339
make me feel attached to them or even care about them. So, any advice on that?

790
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:35,941
Sure. Yeah, I think a lot of this advice can actually do the same thing. Like, you know,

791
00:31:36,601 --> 00:31:38,323
Lee Everett is a character.

792
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:40,145
Reese and Fiona are characters.

793
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:42,347
They're not ciphers, they're not like silent protagonists

794
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,449
that you just embody entirely and become you.

795
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,031
They have their own desires.

796
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:47,793
Like there's a moment in The Walking Dead

797
00:31:47,813 --> 00:31:50,195
where you try and like tell the cop like fuck you

798
00:31:50,295 --> 00:31:52,157
and like Lee goes to do it and then he changes his mind.

799
00:31:52,718 --> 00:31:55,039
We don't do that very often because you don't want to subvert what the player wants to do,

800
00:31:55,099 --> 00:31:57,000
but like Lee is a person with a personality.

801
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,582
He can, you know, he can get overly enraged.

802
00:31:59,622 --> 00:32:00,402
He's very passionate.

803
00:32:00,762 --> 00:32:02,463
He cares about these things and not these things.

804
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,404
He likes, like, American history.

805
00:32:04,424 --> 00:32:06,405
Like, he geeks out about American history at one point in the game.

806
00:32:07,806 --> 00:32:09,567
And so all the same things can still apply,

807
00:32:09,647 --> 00:32:12,849
where you just need to give the time with the character,

808
00:32:12,869 --> 00:32:15,850
and you're going to get that because they're the Avatar, but just give them...

809
00:32:16,822 --> 00:32:21,205
a unique voice. Like Lee, when the four options pop up, each of those is one of the things

810
00:32:21,225 --> 00:32:24,928
that Lee would say. We don't have to explore options that Lee would never do. We don't

811
00:32:24,948 --> 00:32:28,270
have to present those options to the player because Lee would just never say, screw this

812
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:32,113
camp, screw this girl, I'm taking a bus to New York. He just would never do that. So

813
00:32:32,133 --> 00:32:36,216
we don't have to provide those options. So I think just making sure the player feels

814
00:32:36,236 --> 00:32:37,377
like they're getting to know the character.

815
00:32:38,238 --> 00:32:41,640
uh... it it because you get a weird mix of feeling that these you are the ever

816
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:45,543
it but you're not like he's still a your he's you could use your avatar but he's

817
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:46,544
also his own person

818
00:32:48,045 --> 00:32:50,326
just make sure they have their own strong personalities that can come out

819
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:52,928
in dialogue in moments uh... inactions

820
00:32:53,629 --> 00:32:55,930
uh... even if you're telling the players match that zombies face and look

821
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:59,573
the way that the voice acting like how enraged he is the animation like a lot

822
00:32:59,593 --> 00:33:01,654
of the kids you a lot of like understanding for that guy is

823
00:33:02,435 --> 00:33:05,617
and so it's just a very similar and uh... examples to to these

824
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:06,498
these examples

825
00:33:07,471 --> 00:33:07,791
Thank you.

826
00:33:07,811 --> 00:33:08,172
You're welcome.

827
00:33:08,192 --> 00:33:10,275
I don't know if we have any more time.

828
00:33:10,315 --> 00:33:10,816
Are we out of time?

829
00:33:10,956 --> 00:33:11,096
No?

830
00:33:11,376 --> 00:33:12,578
OK, so I'll be outside.

831
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:13,680
You can follow me out there.

832
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,881
So thank you guys so much for coming.
