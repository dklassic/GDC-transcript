1
00:00:05,735 --> 00:00:10,337
Hello? Hey. Hi. Oh. It's on. It's early, too.

2
00:00:10,737 --> 00:00:14,059
Real early. On a Friday. I'm really super glad

3
00:00:14,079 --> 00:00:15,500
you guys could make it. It, it is early.

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,661
It is a Friday. You're probably tired, understandably.

5
00:00:18,861 --> 00:00:21,042
But you made it. You did it. You're wonderful.

6
00:00:21,182 --> 00:00:21,502
Thank you.

7
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:26,340
So, I wanted to talk today about interior design and games.

8
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:29,001
Mastering space and mastering place.

9
00:00:29,702 --> 00:00:32,403
I'm Dan Cox. This was an awesome portrait done for me

10
00:00:32,463 --> 00:00:35,644
by one of my co-workers at Capybara Games, where I work now.

11
00:00:36,225 --> 00:00:38,426
I'm working on Below, and prior to this,

12
00:00:38,606 --> 00:00:40,487
I was working at Ubisoft Toronto,

13
00:00:40,727 --> 00:00:43,288
working on Spinner Cell Blacklist and a secret game as well.

14
00:00:44,368 --> 00:00:46,569
A bunch of other studios for most of my career as well,

15
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:51,192
dealing with three-dimensional games and moving around fully 3D spaces.

16
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:54,670
But for a lot of my career, the vast majority of it,

17
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,391
I've been teaching at Seneca College,

18
00:00:56,591 --> 00:00:57,372
teaching environment art.

19
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:01,354
This has been an incredibly fulfilling experience for me.

20
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:04,757
It's taught me a lot about what people do

21
00:01:04,877 --> 00:01:06,338
and how they might create spaces.

22
00:01:07,138 --> 00:01:10,080
My students would create competent, capable work,

23
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:13,863
but I couldn't quite understand why consistently.

24
00:01:14,443 --> 00:01:15,884
A lot of times they'd start with something bad.

25
00:01:16,624 --> 00:01:17,165
It wouldn't work.

26
00:01:17,765 --> 00:01:19,026
It would be ugly.

27
00:01:19,786 --> 00:01:19,946
But.

28
00:01:21,004 --> 00:01:24,949
we would be able to wrangle it into something powerful and quite of a high quality.

29
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:26,831
But I couldn't understand why.

30
00:01:27,893 --> 00:01:31,017
During much of this time, I was watching interior design shows with my wife.

31
00:01:31,778 --> 00:01:34,020
These were really, really interesting because they would start to talk about

32
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:37,104
the things that I couldn't articulate in class to my students.

33
00:01:38,175 --> 00:01:40,878
So I thought, well, there must be something here.

34
00:01:41,798 --> 00:01:43,980
So I did a talk about it last year.

35
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,522
I also talked about what interior design can teach us

36
00:01:46,602 --> 00:01:47,343
about environment art.

37
00:01:48,003 --> 00:01:49,284
You can watch this on the GDC Vault.

38
00:01:50,065 --> 00:01:53,748
And a lot of this talk was about the fact that we should

39
00:01:53,828 --> 00:01:56,390
look to this field to start getting some ideas.

40
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,372
And it glossed over some ideas of what that might be.

41
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:02,815
And some of those, to cover today, because we're going to

42
00:02:02,835 --> 00:02:04,696
be talking about them a little bit more, are that of

43
00:02:04,816 --> 00:02:05,937
contrast and repetition.

44
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:07,573
So I wanted to cover them a little bit.

45
00:02:08,034 --> 00:02:11,236
Contrast is the idea that we draw out contrast

46
00:02:11,276 --> 00:02:12,897
from one element from the space around it,

47
00:02:13,317 --> 00:02:15,658
either through color, shape, value,

48
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:18,380
or anything along those lines to emphasize it.

49
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,021
We can also do the opposite,

50
00:02:20,701 --> 00:02:22,523
reducing the contrast of an element

51
00:02:22,623 --> 00:02:24,784
just by changing the color of the wall behind it

52
00:02:25,124 --> 00:02:26,585
to de-emphasize those elements.

53
00:02:28,206 --> 00:02:30,447
We can also use contrast to bring out

54
00:02:30,948 --> 00:02:32,669
any of the kind of important parts of the room,

55
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:35,290
such as the table or chairs or the functional pieces.

56
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:39,067
We can use contrast in detail, contrast in pattern,

57
00:02:39,828 --> 00:02:41,649
contrast in rhythm of lines,

58
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:43,591
or just the shapes of the objects themselves.

59
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:46,974
Now repetition is incredibly useful for us as well.

60
00:02:47,554 --> 00:02:49,196
This is something that interior designers use a lot.

61
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:50,917
So what we're seeing in these images

62
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:52,238
is a repetition of color.

63
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:54,260
Much of these colors are being drawn

64
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,561
from specific parts of the room,

65
00:02:55,882 --> 00:02:56,802
and repeated throughout.

66
00:02:57,263 --> 00:02:58,584
That gives us a through line

67
00:02:59,184 --> 00:03:01,386
that makes many disparate elements still work.

68
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:08,362
Even if we have shapes that are different, a consistent throughline of either an animal

69
00:03:08,442 --> 00:03:14,647
shape in general, or the ceramic, or the white elements, gives us that throughline so that

70
00:03:14,687 --> 00:03:17,149
even though the shapes don't work, these things still go together.

71
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:22,013
We can even have spaces with a ton of different, smaller repeating elements within.

72
00:03:22,654 --> 00:03:26,797
So a space may not necessarily look immediately appealing, but it still works.

73
00:03:29,179 --> 00:03:32,221
But the problem with last year's talk was it actually happened to be a little bit too

74
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:32,442
short.

75
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,752
And so, this year, I kind of wanted to do something a little bit more in-depth.

76
00:03:38,212 --> 00:03:42,495
Something that really concretely deals with some of the techniques that interior design deals with.

77
00:03:43,415 --> 00:03:49,398
And in doing some of this research, I started to find that there was one thing that kind of surprised me.

78
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:51,720
I thought interior design was useful last year.

79
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,682
But this time around, with a little bit more research, I started to find that

80
00:03:56,462 --> 00:03:59,424
environment artists must understand interior design.

81
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,445
They absolutely have to.

82
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,752
The fact of the matter is, if we don't understand interior design,

83
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:08,193
it's like a character artist not understanding anatomy.

84
00:04:09,193 --> 00:04:12,214
For interior design, that's very much our kind of anatomy study.

85
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,476
It's the bare bones, basics, fundamental understanding

86
00:04:15,496 --> 00:04:16,496
that we need to build off of.

87
00:04:18,417 --> 00:04:21,738
Because otherwise, we're at the whims of taste or experience.

88
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:25,680
And both of those can be very difficult to come by and are not easy to teach.

89
00:04:26,697 --> 00:04:29,018
Either we have to just trust in our instincts,

90
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:31,120
and if you don't have them, then you're in a bit of trouble.

91
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,582
And if you don't have a ton of experience in dealing with this already,

92
00:04:35,023 --> 00:04:36,404
you don't have a lot to build off of.

93
00:04:37,605 --> 00:04:40,367
So, that is where interior design comes in.

94
00:04:40,807 --> 00:04:43,289
It's got that fundamental understanding that we can start from

95
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:44,410
to build off of.

96
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,872
But, why should we study interior design?

97
00:04:47,312 --> 00:04:49,934
Why not games? Why not movies? Why not concept art?

98
00:04:50,614 --> 00:04:54,357
Well, the fact is, if we study movies, or concept art, or just illustration,

99
00:04:55,158 --> 00:04:57,699
We're primarily dealing with two-dimensional compositions.

100
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,900
Interior design immediately deals with the space around you

101
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,500
and everything that's perceivable within that space in all directions,

102
00:05:06,441 --> 00:05:07,821
which is not what movies deal with.

103
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,421
They're not concerned with it. They shouldn't be.

104
00:05:10,241 --> 00:05:11,202
But for us, we are.

105
00:05:11,942 --> 00:05:12,882
But why not study games?

106
00:05:13,462 --> 00:05:14,922
Well, the problem is,

107
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,043
although games can be incredibly, incredibly beautiful

108
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,143
and incredibly well done,

109
00:05:20,423 --> 00:05:23,744
it's like looking to anime for trying to get anatomy understanding.

110
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:27,999
You're already building off of somebody's either simplified

111
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,201
or exaggerated understanding of what anatomy or interior design might be.

112
00:05:32,881 --> 00:05:35,442
And so you're building off of not the best foundation.

113
00:05:36,863 --> 00:05:38,743
So, the main thing that we need to keep in mind

114
00:05:38,803 --> 00:05:40,604
is that when we start with a good foundation,

115
00:05:40,904 --> 00:05:44,386
we can elevate our craft and create something that builds off of

116
00:05:44,806 --> 00:05:45,506
something solid.

117
00:05:46,587 --> 00:05:49,368
However, that does not apply to other kinds of games.

118
00:05:50,197 --> 00:05:53,640
If you're making something like Kentucky Route Zero, or a game that primarily deals with

119
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,724
two-dimensional compositions, you really do not need to spend a lot of time focusing on

120
00:05:57,764 --> 00:05:58,344
interior design.

121
00:05:59,085 --> 00:05:59,886
It's not the same craft.

122
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,047
It's a different setup.

123
00:06:01,067 --> 00:06:04,049
You are dealing with the rule of thirds and other compositional elements.

124
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:08,633
However, if you're doing something like Bioshock, or any kind of game where the player has a

125
00:06:08,734 --> 00:06:13,097
free-moving camera, that is where it's most important for us to really focus on interior

126
00:06:13,117 --> 00:06:15,520
design, because they deal with the things that we deal with.

127
00:06:17,107 --> 00:06:19,908
What are those things? These are our interior design principles,

128
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:23,430
which is that of order, enrichment, and expression.

129
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:28,092
Order is bringing chaos away

130
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:32,294
and inputting some kind of order and some arrangement to specific elements.

131
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,315
When we're making games, we're composing spaces

132
00:06:35,355 --> 00:06:37,096
full of many disparate kind of elements.

133
00:06:37,696 --> 00:06:39,197
And we need to arrange them in such a way

134
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:42,318
that a person can understand where they're situated in space.

135
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:48,141
Enrichment is the idea of elevating the core experience of being inside of a space.

136
00:06:48,901 --> 00:06:53,803
Making it enriched, making it elevated and interesting at a very, very core level.

137
00:06:54,723 --> 00:06:57,904
Totally separate from narrative, which is expression.

138
00:06:58,844 --> 00:07:01,805
Expression is the suggestion of the mood within a space.

139
00:07:02,486 --> 00:07:06,627
It's the suggestion of the tone or the story or your personal narrative towards that space.

140
00:07:08,068 --> 00:07:09,808
But none of these principles exist in isolation.

141
00:07:10,748 --> 00:07:12,609
All of these must connect together.

142
00:07:12,929 --> 00:07:14,310
They cannot be detached.

143
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:17,212
You can't have a room that is purely order,

144
00:07:17,512 --> 00:07:18,973
which is just bare bones basic,

145
00:07:19,714 --> 00:07:21,415
that doesn't express something

146
00:07:21,455 --> 00:07:22,535
about the people that live there.

147
00:07:23,616 --> 00:07:25,197
None of these things can be detached from each other

148
00:07:25,257 --> 00:07:26,478
in any way, shape, or form.

149
00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:27,799
They're always connected.

150
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,941
The breakdown of these ideas is that order

151
00:07:31,381 --> 00:07:33,983
deals with orientation and spatial definition.

152
00:07:35,023 --> 00:07:36,824
Enrichment deals with complexity,

153
00:07:37,345 --> 00:07:39,246
manipulation of form, and expression.

154
00:07:39,777 --> 00:07:41,758
deals with communication and narrative.

155
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:44,740
First we'll talk about order.

156
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:46,460
Order.

157
00:07:48,781 --> 00:07:52,263
Order deals with the arrangement and position of elements in space,

158
00:07:52,703 --> 00:07:55,585
so as to increase our sense of understanding within that place.

159
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,226
We deal with complex spaces all the time,

160
00:07:58,406 --> 00:07:59,987
made up of many different kinds of elements,

161
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:01,968
and when placed together,

162
00:08:02,168 --> 00:08:04,569
the user should be able to understand where they are,

163
00:08:04,989 --> 00:08:06,370
which can give them a feeling of ease.

164
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,531
That's powerful for us.

165
00:08:09,365 --> 00:08:11,887
If we don't arrange things, people can get lost

166
00:08:12,247 --> 00:08:13,728
and lose all sense of orientation.

167
00:08:14,388 --> 00:08:17,730
Interior design really focuses on the idea of orientation.

168
00:08:18,691 --> 00:08:19,492
But how do they do that?

169
00:08:20,452 --> 00:08:22,653
Well, one, first, they need to deal with pattern.

170
00:08:24,074 --> 00:08:25,075
But not patterns like these.

171
00:08:25,695 --> 00:08:27,076
Oftentimes, when we think of interior design,

172
00:08:27,096 --> 00:08:29,498
we may think of interior design dealing with patterns,

173
00:08:29,538 --> 00:08:31,739
like, literally, like, Dimasque and Paisley

174
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,580
and, like, all these other fancy patterns.

175
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,101
But that's not what I'm talking about today.

176
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,022
The kinds of patterns I'm talking about

177
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:38,763
are perceptible patterns within space.

178
00:08:40,038 --> 00:08:42,579
The pattern in this scene, in both of these areas,

179
00:08:43,199 --> 00:08:44,199
is a pattern of color.

180
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,840
A reuse of color that we can perceive

181
00:08:47,481 --> 00:08:49,101
and see that there's that coherent pattern.

182
00:08:50,582 --> 00:08:53,803
The pattern here is that of ceramic, white, animal.

183
00:08:54,303 --> 00:08:55,964
That's a perceivable pattern that we have.

184
00:08:56,724 --> 00:08:58,144
There's also a hierarchy of pattern.

185
00:08:58,885 --> 00:09:01,266
Most noticeable patterns and then less noticeable.

186
00:09:01,826 --> 00:09:03,967
The first being rectilinear elements in these scenes.

187
00:09:05,027 --> 00:09:05,627
And then that of.

188
00:09:06,908 --> 00:09:10,750
rich, red carpet areas with smaller patterns built within.

189
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:16,412
That of pastel blues or cool colors in the background.

190
00:09:17,212 --> 00:09:20,234
Separate hierarchy of different types of patterns that we can perceive.

191
00:09:21,354 --> 00:09:23,895
That can help some of our orientation within a space.

192
00:09:24,795 --> 00:09:25,936
But what is orientation?

193
00:09:27,737 --> 00:09:30,718
When we walk into a room, or a set of rooms,

194
00:09:31,818 --> 00:09:35,420
we're always taking in mental images of each part, separately.

195
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,717
And then our brains try to put them all back together afterwards,

196
00:09:39,418 --> 00:09:41,678
where we gain a sense of orientation for where we were,

197
00:09:42,178 --> 00:09:43,359
and then where we might end up next.

198
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:48,420
When we see these, we create small mental images of each area,

199
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,141
but it becomes tricky to necessarily put them all together.

200
00:09:53,161 --> 00:09:56,762
And if we can't do that, we can lose all sense of orientation.

201
00:09:57,283 --> 00:10:00,503
We can become very disoriented and totally freaked out.

202
00:10:02,438 --> 00:10:04,859
So how do we create a sense of orientation quickly and easily?

203
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,740
Well, interior design has already dealt with some of this through some studies,

204
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,461
and you can deal with identity, structure, and meaning

205
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,842
to implement a sense of orientation within spaces.

206
00:10:14,763 --> 00:10:17,224
Identity is the idea that you create an iconic element

207
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,804
that people can easily remember and come back to.

208
00:10:20,685 --> 00:10:23,646
So when they imagine a space, they know where it might be situated

209
00:10:24,006 --> 00:10:25,486
because they can easily recall what was there.

210
00:10:26,507 --> 00:10:29,428
Structure is the pattern within those spaces.

211
00:10:30,407 --> 00:10:32,868
It's the repetition of certain elements that we can perceive

212
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:34,569
that are easily memorable.

213
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,351
In this case, the arrangement of the buildings,

214
00:10:37,752 --> 00:10:38,812
their closeness together,

215
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:41,394
and the size of each kind of unit that you can see.

216
00:10:41,935 --> 00:10:43,295
That's the perceptible pattern here,

217
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,477
rather than the buildings themselves.

218
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:49,420
Meaning is your personal meaning towards that space,

219
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,101
something that you're remembering about it

220
00:10:51,481 --> 00:10:52,722
because it means something to you.

221
00:10:53,302 --> 00:10:54,483
So it's easy to recall a space

222
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:57,245
because you're able to remember specific parts about it

223
00:10:57,325 --> 00:10:58,506
because they're meaningful to you.

224
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,078
So how does that work for this?

225
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,179
When we see each part, it's hard to understand

226
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,621
how that whole might look, how the entirety of it might be.

227
00:11:08,762 --> 00:11:10,443
However, if we have identity in that,

228
00:11:10,983 --> 00:11:12,324
we can get a much quicker idea

229
00:11:12,904 --> 00:11:14,525
of what the rest of these things might be

230
00:11:15,005 --> 00:11:16,586
and how those other details might relate.

231
00:11:17,647 --> 00:11:19,928
The structure starts to tell us more about that space

232
00:11:19,988 --> 00:11:21,189
and give us something to recall.

233
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:24,931
And meaning is, frankly, if you were hugging a tiger,

234
00:11:25,411 --> 00:11:27,052
you would remember each little part of one.

235
00:11:28,737 --> 00:11:29,598
Because that's what this was.

236
00:11:30,298 --> 00:11:32,579
It was a small part of this kind of tiger.

237
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,500
And now we're able to see the whole of it,

238
00:11:36,021 --> 00:11:38,362
and with those identifiable pieces,

239
00:11:38,822 --> 00:11:40,983
we're able to recall what this whole thing might be.

240
00:11:42,824 --> 00:11:44,044
But how do we define space

241
00:11:44,305 --> 00:11:45,905
when we're dealing with orientation and order?

242
00:11:46,325 --> 00:11:48,406
Well, first we need to deal with enclosure,

243
00:11:49,007 --> 00:11:50,708
things that exist around us,

244
00:11:50,848 --> 00:11:52,909
because we are dealing with interior design.

245
00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:55,950
You can think of enclosure like your emotions,

246
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,751
your body, and your spirit.

247
00:11:58,485 --> 00:11:59,746
as water.

248
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:02,426
And the enclosure is like a glass.

249
00:12:03,446 --> 00:12:05,007
When we have enclosure around us,

250
00:12:05,287 --> 00:12:07,047
such as floors and a wall,

251
00:12:07,747 --> 00:12:09,008
we have an enclosure behind us.

252
00:12:09,608 --> 00:12:11,928
Our emotions will flow out in front of us in all directions.

253
00:12:13,168 --> 00:12:14,349
This is better than having nothing,

254
00:12:14,969 --> 00:12:17,369
and can at least give us some sort of safety within a space.

255
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,830
If we have a hallway kind of situation,

256
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,110
two walls on both sides of us,

257
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:23,231
our emotions are pushed backwards and forwards.

258
00:12:25,325 --> 00:12:29,550
two walls to the corner of us, we can get a greater sense of ease

259
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:33,113
because we're able to push ourselves back towards that corner and have a

260
00:12:33,193 --> 00:12:34,935
little bit more enclosure than we would normally have.

261
00:12:36,116 --> 00:12:38,639
With enclosure, we start to deal with spatial definition.

262
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,062
Spatial definition, in its most literal sense,

263
00:12:43,123 --> 00:12:45,526
is literal space. Walls, floors,

264
00:12:45,846 --> 00:12:49,430
ceiling. Things that fully block off one space from another.

265
00:12:50,747 --> 00:12:53,707
Let's look at actually applying some literal space

266
00:12:53,967 --> 00:12:56,628
into a situation and see how we get orientation from it.

267
00:12:57,008 --> 00:12:58,889
We have a fully symmetrical space right now.

268
00:12:59,189 --> 00:13:00,889
In all directions, everything is the same.

269
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,050
And as we start to move through this space,

270
00:13:04,691 --> 00:13:06,891
we can see every direction is the exact same.

271
00:13:08,192 --> 00:13:09,312
When we pass through one hallway

272
00:13:09,972 --> 00:13:12,433
and look in both directions, we see the same exact thing.

273
00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:15,954
As we round a corner, the same thing again.

274
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:19,015
We can start to really lose orientation here.

275
00:13:19,896 --> 00:13:21,076
If we're not paying close attention,

276
00:13:22,777 --> 00:13:24,618
it can become really easy to start wondering

277
00:13:24,858 --> 00:13:26,079
if we already passed this hallway.

278
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,439
Have we been here before?

279
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,740
I can barely remember.

280
00:13:30,321 --> 00:13:32,181
Are we north, south, east, west?

281
00:13:33,222 --> 00:13:34,142
Well, let's go to the center.

282
00:13:35,303 --> 00:13:35,903
What do we see now?

283
00:13:37,444 --> 00:13:38,064
Where the hell are we?

284
00:13:40,105 --> 00:13:41,666
That starts to become a huge problem for us.

285
00:13:42,576 --> 00:13:47,458
In fact, Silent Hill's PT teaser game actually used this lack of orientation,

286
00:13:47,738 --> 00:13:50,679
that repetition through a space where you don't know how many times you've gone through it,

287
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:52,860
to scare the crap out of you.

288
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,901
If we want to increase orientation, we need to create perceptible patterns.

289
00:13:58,742 --> 00:14:06,304
So in this situation, we actually have specific, noticeable angles and details that always change.

290
00:14:06,965 --> 00:14:08,425
So you can always orient yourselves.

291
00:14:09,168 --> 00:14:10,949
When you always see a certain set of doors,

292
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:12,690
with a certain perceivable pattern,

293
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,851
it becomes very easy to understand where you are in space.

294
00:14:17,172 --> 00:14:19,153
Each section is slightly different from the others,

295
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:21,915
which allows you to always understand where you are.

296
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,396
In this case, it's a little bit heavy-handed,

297
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,597
and the scene is very, very simple,

298
00:14:27,197 --> 00:14:29,759
so we're able to perceive the patterns very quickly and easily,

299
00:14:29,999 --> 00:14:31,840
because there's very little distracting us from them.

300
00:14:33,621 --> 00:14:35,042
But each area, slightly different.

301
00:14:37,305 --> 00:14:40,668
However, this is literal space, walls and floors.

302
00:14:41,469 --> 00:14:42,189
What else can we deal with?

303
00:14:43,231 --> 00:14:44,612
We can deal with that of implied space.

304
00:14:45,353 --> 00:14:47,915
Implied space is the suggestion of one space from another.

305
00:14:48,536 --> 00:14:51,659
In this case, we have the literal space, the encompassing box.

306
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,182
We also have these two spaces within.

307
00:14:56,904 --> 00:14:58,465
One is defined by the dropped ceiling,

308
00:14:58,926 --> 00:15:01,808
and the next is defined by the lack of that dropped ceiling.

309
00:15:03,283 --> 00:15:05,905
The ways we can imply space in something like this

310
00:15:06,345 --> 00:15:07,867
is that we first deal with our literal space,

311
00:15:08,627 --> 00:15:11,129
and then we can compartmentalize this into smaller spots.

312
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,652
One by changing the pattern of a floor,

313
00:15:14,632 --> 00:15:16,054
arranging elements within a group.

314
00:15:18,195 --> 00:15:20,737
Even light fixtures above create a perceived

315
00:15:21,138 --> 00:15:22,899
spatial definition on the ground below.

316
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,962
We can also define that space

317
00:15:26,002 --> 00:15:27,443
through dropping the level of the floor.

318
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:32,963
And all of those things will go together to create discrete elements of a larger space,

319
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:37,564
which allows us to understand the larger area in a much easier way.

320
00:15:38,964 --> 00:15:42,265
For each of these scenes, there's implied spaces within.

321
00:15:42,965 --> 00:15:47,786
That allows us to break down what the larger space is and have a better sense of understanding

322
00:15:48,006 --> 00:15:50,406
where each part might be and how they relate to each other.

323
00:15:50,926 --> 00:15:56,307
So for example, the large tree elements in here, in the first image, break up the room

324
00:15:56,327 --> 00:15:56,707
into about...

325
00:15:57,789 --> 00:15:59,310
three different larger spaces.

326
00:16:00,671 --> 00:16:03,234
The tables and chairs also define

327
00:16:03,314 --> 00:16:04,655
another smaller set of space.

328
00:16:05,676 --> 00:16:08,238
This is good for us because, like enclosure,

329
00:16:08,638 --> 00:16:10,239
it allows us to feel a little bit more comfortable

330
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,501
in individual pockets.

331
00:16:12,822 --> 00:16:14,263
And all of this can be done without lighting.

332
00:16:15,244 --> 00:16:17,786
A lot of times in games, a lot of environment arts

333
00:16:17,806 --> 00:16:19,267
can really heavily focus on lighting

334
00:16:19,647 --> 00:16:21,349
as being the way that we move people through space

335
00:16:21,469 --> 00:16:22,790
or give them a sense of orientation

336
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,851
or tell them where to go.

337
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,853
And that's just one tool that interior designers use.

338
00:16:27,644 --> 00:16:30,406
They actually very rarely use it for leading a person through space.

339
00:16:30,766 --> 00:16:32,808
It's just there to enliven the experience.

340
00:16:34,729 --> 00:16:37,651
To recap, when we're thinking of order, we want to think of orientation,

341
00:16:38,092 --> 00:16:40,493
which involves identity, structure, and meaning.

342
00:16:41,514 --> 00:16:44,937
And then we can think about spatial definition, which is both literal and implied.

343
00:16:45,837 --> 00:16:49,920
In practice, the things we want to do is look at scenes,

344
00:16:50,561 --> 00:16:54,243
watch through these, and start to ask questions about how order exists.

345
00:16:55,304 --> 00:16:56,825
How are they creating orientation here?

346
00:16:57,408 --> 00:16:58,529
How are they creating identity?

347
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:01,290
Identifiable structures that are easy to remember.

348
00:17:02,711 --> 00:17:04,591
What kind of structure, what repeating pattern

349
00:17:04,631 --> 00:17:05,712
are we seeing in this space

350
00:17:06,272 --> 00:17:09,413
for us to be able to understand where we are?

351
00:17:10,674 --> 00:17:11,814
What's the spatial definition?

352
00:17:12,735 --> 00:17:14,736
Where are we seeing literal space being defined?

353
00:17:15,176 --> 00:17:17,677
And where are we seeing implied space being defined?

354
00:17:18,397 --> 00:17:21,398
The carpets, for example, are another form of implied space.

355
00:17:21,438 --> 00:17:22,439
They separate the room.

356
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:25,960
We have literal spaces, implied spaces.

357
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,361
To create orientation, we have a number of elements in here,

358
00:17:30,622 --> 00:17:32,162
which have a specific identity to them,

359
00:17:32,663 --> 00:17:34,203
which allows us to know which floor we're on.

360
00:17:35,944 --> 00:17:38,045
The structure also slightly changes,

361
00:17:38,365 --> 00:17:39,726
but it's a less perceptible pattern.

362
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,447
The meaning for the space, for us,

363
00:17:43,107 --> 00:17:44,248
is if you've been playing through the game,

364
00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:46,429
you're going to remember your interactions in this area.

365
00:17:46,449 --> 00:17:51,191
Can we start moving to these other floors?

366
00:17:52,116 --> 00:17:55,837
Notice how they create order by changing the identity of certain areas.

367
00:17:56,097 --> 00:17:58,098
The color schemes are a form of identity as well.

368
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:03,440
By asking ourselves these questions as we move through spaces,

369
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,001
we give ourselves a foundation for which we understand

370
00:18:06,321 --> 00:18:08,242
how we might use some of these techniques.

371
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,403
Next we can talk about enrichment.

372
00:18:13,584 --> 00:18:16,625
Enrichment is elevating the experience in a space,

373
00:18:16,905 --> 00:18:18,125
making it more interesting for you.

374
00:18:19,272 --> 00:18:21,373
just either on a movement kind of basis,

375
00:18:22,194 --> 00:18:24,315
or from just a visual field kind of standpoint.

376
00:18:25,256 --> 00:18:27,617
Enrichment is just about the experience

377
00:18:27,637 --> 00:18:30,478
of looking at something, and having that be elevated

378
00:18:30,699 --> 00:18:32,219
from the norm that we might be used to.

379
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,081
It also deals with the ideas of approachability.

380
00:18:36,622 --> 00:18:38,303
Visually, we like scenes that have

381
00:18:38,323 --> 00:18:39,403
a lot of complexity in them.

382
00:18:40,344 --> 00:18:42,785
That's just a number of studies that interior design

383
00:18:42,985 --> 00:18:43,265
has done.

384
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:47,662
And so we've got a scale of complexity on the base here,

385
00:18:48,483 --> 00:18:50,244
and a scale of how much somebody might like something.

386
00:18:50,904 --> 00:18:53,686
What they found was, as a scene gets more complex

387
00:18:53,846 --> 00:18:56,968
in our visual field, people start to like it more.

388
00:18:57,969 --> 00:19:00,090
However, it starts to taper off at a certain point,

389
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,711
and if a scene starts to get too complex,

390
00:19:02,051 --> 00:19:03,072
people start to like it less,

391
00:19:03,372 --> 00:19:05,133
and want to approach it significantly less.

392
00:19:06,034 --> 00:19:06,894
Which means right in the middle,

393
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:08,896
we have this area of optimum complexity.

394
00:19:09,776 --> 00:19:11,477
So if a space is too boring and simple,

395
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,099
you don't necessarily want to dive in and go there.

396
00:19:15,075 --> 00:19:18,697
However, if the space is too complex, you also don't want to either.

397
00:19:19,777 --> 00:19:23,499
What they found was the spaces that people appreciated the most were naturalistic spaces,

398
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,442
where we can see perceptible patterns and repetition of elements,

399
00:19:28,322 --> 00:19:33,945
because our eyes love to break down scenes and visual areas into smaller component parts

400
00:19:34,486 --> 00:19:36,987
and actually do some work, but they don't want to do too much.

401
00:19:38,797 --> 00:19:42,659
So, what kind of techniques can we use to increase approachability when dealing with complexity?

402
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:47,561
Well, we deal with the techniques of complexity, coherence, legibility, and mystery.

403
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:52,284
Complexity is that we do like to see complexity in our visual field.

404
00:19:52,924 --> 00:19:57,587
We like to see things that we can break down and compartmentalize and do work with.

405
00:19:58,427 --> 00:20:01,409
Animals love to break down patterns.

406
00:20:02,129 --> 00:20:06,691
And the more times that we're able to do that, the more space can be interesting within that threshold.

407
00:20:08,278 --> 00:20:10,099
But the thing is, we need to balance that threshold.

408
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,460
How do we do that without just having, like,

409
00:20:13,661 --> 00:20:16,102
a medium complexity world all the time?

410
00:20:16,923 --> 00:20:18,723
Well, we can use legibility.

411
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,165
Legibility is our ability to break down a space

412
00:20:22,465 --> 00:20:23,546
into those component parts.

413
00:20:24,566 --> 00:20:26,707
It's when we can break down specific elements

414
00:20:27,848 --> 00:20:29,809
and understand how to chunk out a space.

415
00:20:30,649 --> 00:20:33,450
A lack of legibility means that we can't really understand

416
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,051
what's going on.

417
00:20:34,611 --> 00:20:36,872
And even though the space may not be necessarily that complex,

418
00:20:37,684 --> 00:20:40,605
we can't tell what's going on, and it becomes less approachable.

419
00:20:41,526 --> 00:20:43,627
However, if you increase legibility in a space,

420
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:46,308
you can still have significant amounts of complexity within it,

421
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:47,729
lots of little details.

422
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:50,930
But a lack of legibility with those same details

423
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,271
starts to become a problem.

424
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,212
Next, we can talk about coherence,

425
00:20:56,013 --> 00:20:59,294
which is our appreciation for patterns within space

426
00:20:59,915 --> 00:21:00,975
and perceiving those patterns.

427
00:21:01,897 --> 00:21:05,159
So in this area, we've got straight lines with an angular element built in.

428
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,563
That's repeated through the chairs and all the different types of areas in the back as

429
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:12,365
well, where you get straight lines and a little bit of an angle.

430
00:21:13,946 --> 00:21:18,930
In this scene as well, we have this really, really interesting ceiling piece with a really

431
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,692
cool pattern, but it doesn't really fit with everything else.

432
00:21:21,312 --> 00:21:23,514
Except if you notice the railings have a double line.

433
00:21:24,615 --> 00:21:27,497
That double line also repeats itself through the ceiling.

434
00:21:27,854 --> 00:21:29,515
and is almost the exact same distance apart,

435
00:21:30,116 --> 00:21:32,358
creating that coherence that makes some of this

436
00:21:32,478 --> 00:21:33,218
actually work together.

437
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:37,402
Mystery is the idea that we want to investigate spaces,

438
00:21:37,482 --> 00:21:38,704
that we want to move into them.

439
00:21:39,404 --> 00:21:40,445
The more you present something

440
00:21:40,485 --> 00:21:42,827
that somebody might want to investigate further,

441
00:21:43,548 --> 00:21:45,210
the more enriched that space can be,

442
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,011
and the more somebody might want to investigate it.

443
00:21:48,012 --> 00:21:49,253
Anytime that that kind of happens,

444
00:21:49,894 --> 00:21:51,575
a space becomes a little bit more mysterious,

445
00:21:51,996 --> 00:21:53,337
a little bit more interesting to explore.

446
00:21:54,277 --> 00:21:56,658
My favorite example of that is with Dark Souls.

447
00:21:57,258 --> 00:21:59,599
If you're in the Darkroot Basin, if you're aware of it,

448
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,841
way off in the distance, there's these tendril-y things

449
00:22:02,901 --> 00:22:03,781
moving off in the distance,

450
00:22:04,461 --> 00:22:05,982
and you're wondering what the hell it is.

451
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:08,423
You're scared, but you really want to know what it is.

452
00:22:09,404 --> 00:22:10,524
And it's a friggin' hydra.

453
00:22:12,005 --> 00:22:13,646
Which is unpleasant once you get there.

454
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:16,427
But all of that leads to that mystery

455
00:22:16,487 --> 00:22:18,468
and leads you to want to investigate further.

456
00:22:18,888 --> 00:22:21,350
Even when, in Dark Souls, it's not a great idea to do that.

457
00:22:22,725 --> 00:22:24,425
Which leads us to a universal enrichment.

458
00:22:25,025 --> 00:22:29,307
The fact is, if enrichment kind of deals with the ideas of approachability,

459
00:22:30,367 --> 00:22:32,408
then we can have a universal form of enrichment.

460
00:22:32,468 --> 00:22:34,429
It doesn't need to just deal with interior design.

461
00:22:34,489 --> 00:22:35,729
It can deal with anything.

462
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:40,091
We can have enrichment that is detached from narrative,

463
00:22:40,491 --> 00:22:42,171
from other kinds of expression in that space,

464
00:22:42,271 --> 00:22:46,133
and have things and techniques that we can use in almost any scenario to enrich it.

465
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:49,876
So for example, the manipulation of our enclosing space.

466
00:22:50,716 --> 00:22:52,857
By default, this room is a perfect example of it.

467
00:22:53,437 --> 00:22:55,638
Our walls are straight, and our floors are flat,

468
00:22:55,898 --> 00:22:57,419
and the ceiling is also flat as well.

469
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:58,579
This is what we're used to.

470
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:00,880
So it is not an enriched space,

471
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,380
because it's just the default for us.

472
00:23:03,921 --> 00:23:05,121
If we start to move those things,

473
00:23:05,201 --> 00:23:06,762
manipulate that enclosing space,

474
00:23:07,542 --> 00:23:10,603
it can become a more enriching area to be within.

475
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:12,503
Something that's unexpected,

476
00:23:13,124 --> 00:23:14,664
and can be something that we can enjoy being within.

477
00:23:16,714 --> 00:23:19,795
Some examples of that can be really, really interesting

478
00:23:19,835 --> 00:23:20,915
enriching spaces for us.

479
00:23:21,596 --> 00:23:22,576
We don't always have to use it.

480
00:23:22,936 --> 00:23:23,836
It doesn't have to be extreme,

481
00:23:24,697 --> 00:23:25,877
but it is there for us to use.

482
00:23:26,657 --> 00:23:28,938
We can also have the manipulation of that enclosing space

483
00:23:29,258 --> 00:23:30,199
over a broader area.

484
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:32,900
Not just the walls and floors on a small area,

485
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,560
but actually over the entirety of a space.

486
00:23:35,941 --> 00:23:38,521
These concentric circles conforming to our walls

487
00:23:39,282 --> 00:23:41,582
give us something to work with for our enclosing space.

488
00:23:42,683 --> 00:23:44,443
This area is enriched in a small way.

489
00:23:45,148 --> 00:23:46,990
Because this changes our experience of the norm.

490
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:49,912
We have to move through curved areas where we wouldn't normally do that.

491
00:23:50,893 --> 00:23:53,054
And it just makes for something that is slightly enriched.

492
00:23:53,775 --> 00:23:55,416
When we know how to slightly enrich something,

493
00:23:55,957 --> 00:23:57,858
we can start to use more exaggerated versions of it

494
00:23:58,198 --> 00:23:59,179
to get a greater impact.

495
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,922
And the fact is, this is more than usable

496
00:24:03,322 --> 00:24:04,983
on just interior design ideas.

497
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:08,666
Caves are already manipulated in closing surfaces.

498
00:24:09,387 --> 00:24:12,649
All those spaces have all those kinds of angles to them.

499
00:24:13,397 --> 00:24:15,539
They're changed in this exact same way.

500
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,302
And so these kinds of patterns are something that we already appreciate

501
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:20,483
in other kinds of spaces.

502
00:24:21,183 --> 00:24:23,585
So you can use these kind of techniques in any scenario.

503
00:24:23,605 --> 00:24:26,167
We can also think about surface articulation.

504
00:24:27,268 --> 00:24:30,070
In a lot of situations we might have a flat surface, which is relatively simple.

505
00:24:31,191 --> 00:24:33,973
But if we start to add pattern to it, something that's perceivable,

506
00:24:35,114 --> 00:24:37,055
then the space starts to become a little bit more interesting.

507
00:24:38,056 --> 00:24:39,717
As long as the pattern's not too repetitive.

508
00:24:40,318 --> 00:24:42,259
If the pattern is incredibly repetitive,

509
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,504
it's not that interesting for us to break down.

510
00:24:45,364 --> 00:24:47,386
However, if we start to change that pattern a little bit,

511
00:24:48,147 --> 00:24:50,429
and start to make the pattern slightly less perceptible,

512
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:52,290
or change it up even a bit more,

513
00:24:53,171 --> 00:24:54,732
that can be something that's really enriching.

514
00:24:54,972 --> 00:24:57,014
It gives our eyes more things to work with.

515
00:24:57,955 --> 00:24:59,836
If the pattern starts to become imperceptible,

516
00:25:00,897 --> 00:25:03,940
that can start to lead to a lack of legibility or coherence,

517
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,982
which makes it somewhat less approachable,

518
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:08,063
somewhat less, not necessarily enriched,

519
00:25:08,103 --> 00:25:09,425
but a little bit more confusing.

520
00:25:10,631 --> 00:25:12,531
If we start to make that pattern more perceptible again,

521
00:25:13,092 --> 00:25:14,892
then you can start to have something that works.

522
00:25:15,112 --> 00:25:16,933
We can use these kinds of surface articulations

523
00:25:16,993 --> 00:25:18,573
to lead the player through a space,

524
00:25:18,733 --> 00:25:19,813
to lead them through an area,

525
00:25:20,294 --> 00:25:22,254
to break up certain areas so that a hallway

526
00:25:22,294 --> 00:25:23,815
doesn't look like it becomes too long.

527
00:25:25,195 --> 00:25:26,655
And those are really, really powerful for us.

528
00:25:27,456 --> 00:25:29,876
Patterns in our surface articulation can be

529
00:25:30,656 --> 00:25:33,537
just flat on the wall, just painted on,

530
00:25:34,338 --> 00:25:35,778
or they can actually have a relief to them,

531
00:25:36,438 --> 00:25:37,538
a thickness and a shape.

532
00:25:39,457 --> 00:25:41,778
And all of these kind of things can move you through space,

533
00:25:42,358 --> 00:25:44,420
and just elevate the experience of being in there.

534
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,863
Surface articulation can exist as well on non-man-made patterns.

535
00:25:50,604 --> 00:25:54,746
Things that are just a little bit more naturalistic, or normal.

536
00:25:55,407 --> 00:25:58,249
These are all forms of surface articulation.

537
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,471
Whether they're intended or not,

538
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,553
they still create the same impact for us as users.

539
00:26:05,774 --> 00:26:08,335
Next we can think about spatial composition.

540
00:26:09,626 --> 00:26:12,448
If we don't compose our elements in space, they become very confusing,

541
00:26:12,508 --> 00:26:14,950
and we can't make sense of why they're there and what they're doing.

542
00:26:15,931 --> 00:26:19,473
If we compose them in space, it becomes a little bit easier for us to make sense of them.

543
00:26:19,793 --> 00:26:21,074
This increases their legibility.

544
00:26:22,495 --> 00:26:24,537
Total chaos becomes really difficult to deal with.

545
00:26:25,177 --> 00:26:28,660
However, if we create that order to it, the space becomes more legible.

546
00:26:30,241 --> 00:26:33,723
If we have a ton of chairs and tables, all just scattered throughout a space,

547
00:26:35,044 --> 00:26:36,425
it certainly has complexity.

548
00:26:37,766 --> 00:26:37,907
But...

549
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:42,172
very, very, very little legibility. If we don't

550
00:26:42,213 --> 00:26:44,254
balance those things, then we lose some of the

551
00:26:44,274 --> 00:26:45,675
enrichment that we might get out of these.

552
00:26:47,717 --> 00:26:50,139
Moving through this space is an enriching experience, because

553
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:51,981
we kind of have to move around, but we

554
00:26:52,001 --> 00:26:55,003
start to lose all sense of what's happening, and

555
00:26:55,023 --> 00:26:58,306
we could utilize this much better. However, if we

556
00:26:58,326 --> 00:27:00,628
create too much order to this, the space is

557
00:27:00,668 --> 00:27:02,370
not necessarily all that enriched.

558
00:27:03,891 --> 00:27:05,072
It's composed, certainly.

559
00:27:06,093 --> 00:27:08,335
but is not necessarily that interesting for us to move through.

560
00:27:09,415 --> 00:27:11,357
Our enrichment can happen on more than the visual field.

561
00:27:11,817 --> 00:27:13,639
It can also happen on the movement field.

562
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,961
As we move through a space differently,

563
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:18,543
just by rearranging the composition of these elements,

564
00:27:19,683 --> 00:27:21,045
our movement path has been changed.

565
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:26,088
This becomes a small, slight, subtle enrichment to what we had before

566
00:27:26,589 --> 00:27:28,991
by just spatially composing our elements differently.

567
00:27:34,255 --> 00:27:34,695
We can also...

568
00:27:35,313 --> 00:27:36,813
change up the pattern between two areas.

569
00:27:37,473 --> 00:27:40,414
Our spatial compositions can suggest two distinct areas

570
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,915
with multiple movement schemes built within.

571
00:27:43,835 --> 00:27:45,975
In each area, you have to move through the space

572
00:27:46,075 --> 00:27:46,656
slightly different.

573
00:27:47,536 --> 00:27:48,816
But the composition of these elements

574
00:27:49,216 --> 00:27:50,336
also lets us feel at ease

575
00:27:50,857 --> 00:27:53,157
because we can compartmentalize ourselves

576
00:27:53,217 --> 00:27:54,137
into smaller parts.

577
00:27:55,558 --> 00:27:58,839
When we see a scene that has no spatial composition,

578
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:01,139
it can become kind of disorienting

579
00:28:01,239 --> 00:28:03,480
and somewhat scary and freaky to be within.

580
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:07,458
But if each area gives us a spot that we can kind of relax within,

581
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,663
then we can feel a little bit more IDs moving through it and around it.

582
00:28:15,866 --> 00:28:17,948
Novelty is the idea that we want something that's

583
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:19,870
gonna stand out from everything else.

584
00:28:20,811 --> 00:28:22,933
That's the easiest form of enrichment,

585
00:28:23,013 --> 00:28:25,475
and one that we use a ton, and are really good at.

586
00:28:26,654 --> 00:28:29,356
Novelty is just having something that's impactful and interesting

587
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,377
and just quite a bit different from everything else.

588
00:28:32,138 --> 00:28:33,498
It's enriching because when you see it,

589
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:35,400
you're just excited and it's awesome.

590
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,982
The problem is, if we use too much novelty

591
00:28:39,722 --> 00:28:41,804
at too high of an intensity all the time,

592
00:28:42,744 --> 00:28:44,806
it can become difficult for a user

593
00:28:45,146 --> 00:28:46,627
to notice every time that we did it.

594
00:28:48,188 --> 00:28:51,030
So the problem is, is if we start to have too much novelty,

595
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,672
we're going to have to use really exaggerated forms of novelty

596
00:28:55,132 --> 00:28:55,993
for somebody to spot it.

597
00:28:57,431 --> 00:28:59,332
because we have to go so far in that direction.

598
00:29:00,453 --> 00:29:02,153
If we think of novelty like a value scale,

599
00:29:02,814 --> 00:29:04,054
going from black to white,

600
00:29:05,235 --> 00:29:08,036
white being the highest form of novelty,

601
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:11,118
and black being another extremely high form of novelty.

602
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:13,359
If we just have black and white,

603
00:29:13,779 --> 00:29:14,960
with no gradients in between,

604
00:29:16,061 --> 00:29:18,122
things can become difficult to understand on the whole.

605
00:29:19,042 --> 00:29:19,903
If we look at this image,

606
00:29:20,203 --> 00:29:22,064
and imagine it like the experience of being

607
00:29:22,864 --> 00:29:25,045
in an entire game, from beginning to end,

608
00:29:25,205 --> 00:29:26,106
each little part of it.

609
00:29:26,837 --> 00:29:30,819
is black, white, tons of novelty in each little section.

610
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,421
If we don't control that value scale,

611
00:29:33,721 --> 00:29:35,062
that intensity of our novelty,

612
00:29:35,642 --> 00:29:38,384
it's hard to understand what our whole experience was,

613
00:29:39,304 --> 00:29:40,725
how to remember each little part,

614
00:29:41,326 --> 00:29:42,907
because everything's identifiable,

615
00:29:43,147 --> 00:29:45,188
because everything's memorable, nothing's memorable.

616
00:29:45,829 --> 00:29:46,969
If we control that a little bit better,

617
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,711
we can start to understand what the entirety

618
00:29:49,731 --> 00:29:50,892
of that experience might be,

619
00:29:51,392 --> 00:29:54,554
because each part has a little bit more value change to it.

620
00:29:55,653 --> 00:29:58,414
One of the best examples I can think of for this is the Stanley Parable.

621
00:29:59,615 --> 00:30:02,056
Each area that you're going through kind of repeats itself a lot.

622
00:30:03,196 --> 00:30:06,778
But little parts change, and you start to notice that novelty

623
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:10,159
incredibly quickly, because there's very little else happening.

624
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,941
So every time something changes, that novelty is incredibly usable.

625
00:30:15,762 --> 00:30:16,742
And incredibly memorable.

626
00:30:18,503 --> 00:30:20,264
We can also think about tension.

627
00:30:21,008 --> 00:30:23,189
Tension is this feeling that as we move through a space,

628
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:26,291
if the space starts to enclose around us a little bit more,

629
00:30:26,551 --> 00:30:28,892
that's an enriching experience. It's something interesting for us.

630
00:30:29,892 --> 00:30:31,033
We need to release that tension,

631
00:30:31,613 --> 00:30:34,994
and we can increase or release it in many different kinds of ways,

632
00:30:35,175 --> 00:30:36,675
either gradually or abruptly.

633
00:30:38,816 --> 00:30:41,837
A great example of this is through the recent Uncharted videos,

634
00:30:42,978 --> 00:30:45,639
where as he moves through this cave, the tension starts being increased.

635
00:30:47,783 --> 00:30:51,005
As he walks through more caves, the tension starts increasing a little bit more,

636
00:30:52,186 --> 00:30:53,146
and then a little bit more,

637
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:58,850
to the maximum kind of intensity that we can get for some of this tension.

638
00:30:59,531 --> 00:31:01,592
And then, that release of tension

639
00:31:02,433 --> 00:31:04,274
creates a really enriching experience for us.

640
00:31:06,636 --> 00:31:09,057
So to recap, when we think about enrichment,

641
00:31:09,277 --> 00:31:11,119
we can think about the ideas of approachability,

642
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:15,501
complexity, legibility, coherence, and mystery.

643
00:31:17,193 --> 00:31:19,393
Our spatial compositions, our manipulation

644
00:31:19,413 --> 00:31:21,994
of enclosing space, surface articulation,

645
00:31:22,074 --> 00:31:23,334
novelty, and tension.

646
00:31:24,354 --> 00:31:26,115
All of these things are incredibly useful

647
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:28,475
for us to deal with for enriching a space

648
00:31:28,976 --> 00:31:31,556
and enriching the experience for a user inside of it.

649
00:31:34,397 --> 00:31:36,477
And it's important for us to ask ourselves these questions

650
00:31:36,917 --> 00:31:37,758
when we see a space.

651
00:31:39,158 --> 00:31:42,139
When we look at an area, how is it creating enrichment?

652
00:31:42,719 --> 00:31:45,119
How is it dealing with balancing the complexity

653
00:31:45,139 --> 00:31:45,599
of the scene?

654
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:46,900
What about the legibility?

655
00:31:48,223 --> 00:31:50,964
Where are you seeing a repetition of certain patterns

656
00:31:51,645 --> 00:31:53,366
that go together to create that coherence?

657
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:56,987
What are the spatial compositions that we're seeing here

658
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:58,408
to break things apart?

659
00:31:58,989 --> 00:32:01,510
What about tension and the release of that tension?

660
00:32:02,691 --> 00:32:04,211
How are they dealing with the manipulation

661
00:32:04,231 --> 00:32:05,012
of enclosing space?

662
00:32:05,072 --> 00:32:05,812
Are they using it?

663
00:32:06,453 --> 00:32:07,273
Are they not using it?

664
00:32:08,554 --> 00:32:09,254
Do they need to?

665
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:11,815
Balancing each of those things

666
00:32:11,895 --> 00:32:13,176
is incredibly valuable for us.

667
00:32:14,677 --> 00:32:16,198
What are they doing for surface articulation?

668
00:32:17,993 --> 00:32:19,675
Are they doing anything for it? Is it necessary?

669
00:32:19,955 --> 00:32:21,036
How are they creating novelty?

670
00:32:22,418 --> 00:32:25,180
Each room in these spaces actually has a form of novelty,

671
00:32:25,681 --> 00:32:27,803
whether really strong or relatively subtle.

672
00:32:29,624 --> 00:32:31,486
That novelty may not exist between all, like,

673
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,708
many other rooms between the entire world, but

674
00:32:34,209 --> 00:32:35,550
each space feels slightly different.

675
00:32:36,931 --> 00:32:39,694
The novelty here also comes from that blue light in this area.

676
00:32:41,652 --> 00:32:42,852
gives us something different to deal with.

677
00:32:43,473 --> 00:32:45,753
When we look at this back area, we have a sense of mystery.

678
00:32:46,253 --> 00:32:47,133
We want to investigate it,

679
00:32:47,153 --> 00:32:48,794
because it's quite a bit different from the other areas,

680
00:32:49,414 --> 00:32:51,314
and it starts to be something that's worthwhile to explore.

681
00:32:52,274 --> 00:32:53,735
There's complexity in these spaces,

682
00:32:54,415 --> 00:32:56,195
but balanced with legibility and coherence.

683
00:32:57,336 --> 00:32:58,796
All of these things are useful for us

684
00:32:58,836 --> 00:33:01,276
to ask ourselves about when we deal with the space,

685
00:33:01,296 --> 00:33:03,697
so we can understand the simpler ideas

686
00:33:04,097 --> 00:33:05,457
of how we might use those techniques.

687
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:08,838
Last, we can talk about expression.

688
00:33:10,178 --> 00:33:10,558
Expression.

689
00:33:11,544 --> 00:33:15,987
is how we deal with the mood or tone or narrative of a space.

690
00:33:16,007 --> 00:33:22,012
So when we're dealing with expression, it's what we're telling the user, the broad ideas

691
00:33:22,052 --> 00:33:22,552
of a space.

692
00:33:22,912 --> 00:33:27,816
It's our communication with the user and their ability to maybe understand what that communication

693
00:33:27,936 --> 00:33:28,076
is.

694
00:33:29,277 --> 00:33:30,858
We're actually really good at expression.

695
00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:35,211
Interior design is probably the least effective in

696
00:33:35,512 --> 00:33:38,494
telling us stuff about expression, because that's what we

697
00:33:38,554 --> 00:33:41,456
generally focus on. We're always telling stories in

698
00:33:41,697 --> 00:33:44,479
spaces. That's actually really what we're good at.

699
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,421
But there are interesting things that expression deals with

700
00:33:47,461 --> 00:33:50,804
in interior design that I found helpful. And it's

701
00:33:50,844 --> 00:33:53,146
less of a technique, specifically, and more of a

702
00:33:53,206 --> 00:33:56,288
mindset when dealing with a space. And that's the

703
00:33:56,328 --> 00:33:59,671
ideas of world expression, inhabitant expression, and symbolism.

704
00:34:00,934 --> 00:34:02,475
So when we're thinking about world expression,

705
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:04,896
the techniques that we want to specifically think about

706
00:34:05,316 --> 00:34:07,617
is that of historical and cultural.

707
00:34:08,837 --> 00:34:11,258
Historical is when we're dealing with

708
00:34:11,798 --> 00:34:14,259
the history of a space told through its visuals.

709
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,700
What time period was this place built within?

710
00:34:19,181 --> 00:34:20,841
What was the era around that?

711
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:24,623
And how does that space express that history?

712
00:34:25,895 --> 00:34:28,518
Each of these kinds of places expresses its history

713
00:34:28,899 --> 00:34:32,082
through the details within. It's certainly enriched and it

714
00:34:32,122 --> 00:34:34,785
has order. Again, we can't disconnect those things.

715
00:34:36,267 --> 00:34:39,170
But when we're thinking about historical expression, we're just

716
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:42,694
thinking about what the history is and how to

717
00:34:42,754 --> 00:34:43,235
express that.

718
00:34:45,127 --> 00:34:48,791
For Portal 2, the dilapidated sense of space here

719
00:34:49,351 --> 00:34:50,973
suggests something about the history.

720
00:34:51,474 --> 00:34:52,875
Especially if you've played Portal 1,

721
00:34:53,496 --> 00:34:55,578
you start to get a good sense of how

722
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:58,582
history is being expressed within this space.

723
00:35:00,504 --> 00:35:01,285
The inclusion of.

724
00:35:02,139 --> 00:35:05,341
1920s kind of propaganda and shapes and details,

725
00:35:05,921 --> 00:35:09,643
in Colombia, really suggests something about the history of this space

726
00:35:10,403 --> 00:35:12,184
and how it relates. Fictional spaces

727
00:35:12,924 --> 00:35:15,786
all still have their own inherent history that can be expressed.

728
00:35:16,966 --> 00:35:18,527
We can also think about cultural expression.

729
00:35:20,188 --> 00:35:22,629
Whenever we're expressing a type of culture in a space,

730
00:35:23,129 --> 00:35:24,810
you're using symbols and things like that

731
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:28,231
to suggest or express a specific type of culture there.

732
00:35:29,772 --> 00:35:31,333
It can also be really heavy-handed.

733
00:35:32,342 --> 00:35:36,142
and maybe even really tacky, but it is still a form of expression.

734
00:35:36,302 --> 00:35:38,183
You're expressing a type of culture there.

735
00:35:39,383 --> 00:35:43,103
For Columbia, that's the expression of really heavy-handed Americana

736
00:35:43,564 --> 00:35:44,584
and religious figures.

737
00:35:46,484 --> 00:35:50,545
Or, in some cases, being really stereotypical and cliché

738
00:35:50,985 --> 00:35:55,005
to kind of emphasize the certain tones that that group might be having

739
00:35:55,606 --> 00:35:57,586
in terms of how they perceive other kinds of cultures.

740
00:35:59,386 --> 00:36:01,027
We can think of an inhabitant expression.

741
00:36:02,232 --> 00:36:06,595
And by inhabitants, I mean anybody that lives inside of a space or exists within it,

742
00:36:06,815 --> 00:36:08,256
either temporarily or otherwise.

743
00:36:09,217 --> 00:36:11,839
The inhabitant may have built the space that they're within,

744
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,681
or they may just simply be squatting.

745
00:36:15,182 --> 00:36:17,864
The identity of them is going to help us understand

746
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:21,407
how to deal with what they might be expressing within that space.

747
00:36:22,268 --> 00:36:24,750
The techniques that we can use within that are that of attitude,

748
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,633
and their sophistication, and their self-presentation of those ideas.

749
00:36:29,974 --> 00:36:30,334
Attitude.

750
00:36:31,237 --> 00:36:35,038
can be how friendly or unfriendly the inhabitants may be

751
00:36:36,019 --> 00:36:37,660
and their expression of those things within.

752
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,961
They can be something that they've either built

753
00:36:40,441 --> 00:36:43,483
to suggest that kind of attitude and expressing that,

754
00:36:44,123 --> 00:36:45,724
or something that they've simply placed

755
00:36:45,744 --> 00:36:46,724
on the walls themselves.

756
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:49,466
All of these kinds of things

757
00:36:50,206 --> 00:36:51,887
are a form of inhabitant expression.

758
00:36:52,867 --> 00:36:53,888
When you go through that space,

759
00:36:53,928 --> 00:36:55,849
you understand who these people might be

760
00:36:56,389 --> 00:36:58,490
and what their friendliness or attitude might be.

761
00:37:00,025 --> 00:37:06,250
It can also be a sense of their humor, or any kind of thing that tells you something about who they are,

762
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,672
who they think they are, and maybe who they want to be.

763
00:37:11,653 --> 00:37:16,677
Their sophistication suggests their appreciation for taste and aesthetics.

764
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:22,541
Sophistication, in terms of how we relate that through the inhabitant expression,

765
00:37:24,062 --> 00:37:25,222
is how we make sure that they have...

766
00:37:26,255 --> 00:37:29,217
a clear sense of how much they appreciate the aesthetic somewhere,

767
00:37:29,597 --> 00:37:32,698
making sure that they have a high quality sense of taste,

768
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:35,100
or that they maybe don't,

769
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,201
and aren't concerned with those kinds of things.

770
00:37:38,861 --> 00:37:40,642
And all of this is going to be modified

771
00:37:41,543 --> 00:37:43,163
by the self-presentation of those people,

772
00:37:44,124 --> 00:37:45,705
how much they want you to see

773
00:37:46,365 --> 00:37:49,546
that kind of presentation of sophistication or attitude.

774
00:37:50,367 --> 00:37:51,027
In one situation,

775
00:37:52,017 --> 00:37:54,560
To express their attitude, they may just let things be on the walls

776
00:37:55,181 --> 00:37:58,644
and tons of graffiti everywhere to suggest the kind of attitude

777
00:37:58,925 --> 00:38:00,486
and their appreciation of sophistication.

778
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,029
Or, they may clean some of that stuff up.

779
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:07,294
The same kind of space, but simplified somewhat,

780
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:09,616
because they don't want to express too much of that attitude.

781
00:38:11,058 --> 00:38:12,139
We can also think about symbolism.

782
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:15,599
That of either the feeling of ascending and descending,

783
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:17,019
or admittance and refusal.

784
00:38:17,859 --> 00:38:20,580
Symbolism is something that's incredibly valuable for us,

785
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,281
and is still very often used in interior design.

786
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:26,261
It's that broader communication of story

787
00:38:26,681 --> 00:38:29,362
and a universal human experience for users.

788
00:38:30,562 --> 00:38:32,082
This is incredibly useful for us,

789
00:38:32,503 --> 00:38:34,383
because we can suggest broad ideas,

790
00:38:35,143 --> 00:38:36,543
rather than always just small ones.

791
00:38:37,264 --> 00:38:39,304
It's very easy for a player to miss these things.

792
00:38:40,162 --> 00:38:44,545
Because symbolism is always very important for their cultural experience,

793
00:38:44,605 --> 00:38:45,906
for their personal experience.

794
00:38:46,607 --> 00:38:49,309
Some users will not see that symbolism or will not recognize it.

795
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:52,672
But to have it there is still incredibly powerful for us.

796
00:38:54,313 --> 00:38:55,994
The ideas of ascending and descending.

797
00:38:57,015 --> 00:38:58,416
When you move up through a space,

798
00:38:58,796 --> 00:39:00,998
there's a suggestion of like sort of a heavenly movement,

799
00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:02,940
which can still be modified, again,

800
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,482
based on a person's personal experience or cultural experiences.

801
00:39:07,884 --> 00:39:09,025
We can utilize these things again.

802
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:14,137
In Portal 2, where you descend and you fall and you lose something of yourself.

803
00:39:15,178 --> 00:39:20,641
These kinds of broader symbolism creates a narrative that's somewhat separate from the

804
00:39:20,781 --> 00:39:22,422
obvious explicit narrative.

805
00:39:23,803 --> 00:39:29,547
The ideas of remittance and refusal is that when you want somebody to come into a space,

806
00:39:30,227 --> 00:39:30,948
you can show them that.

807
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:35,951
You can symbolize that through open doors, showing lots of light into that space, to

808
00:39:35,971 --> 00:39:37,792
make sure that somebody feels like they are very much welcome.

809
00:39:40,608 --> 00:39:44,570
doing the opposite. Creating that sense that somebody is not allowed into that space.

810
00:39:44,951 --> 00:39:48,253
Symbolizing those things and suggesting that through our expression.

811
00:39:49,493 --> 00:39:53,356
But how do we do this in practice? Well, Mad Men's a great example in an office.

812
00:39:54,917 --> 00:39:58,979
In this kind of space, this is also enriched and there's order and all those kinds of things,

813
00:39:59,019 --> 00:40:03,883
but for expression, we're specifically getting an idea of what the history of this place is.

814
00:40:04,963 --> 00:40:08,966
Because we can see how these things look and what kind of time period they express.

815
00:40:10,233 --> 00:40:12,114
Also, there's clear cultural expression here.

816
00:40:13,335 --> 00:40:17,337
Because we can recognize how that relates to the culture that this place existed within.

817
00:40:19,419 --> 00:40:20,900
Also, inhabitant expression.

818
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:25,623
An office with a ton of booze in it suggests something about the inhabitants there.

819
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:28,965
Whether it's already placed in advance,

820
00:40:29,806 --> 00:40:31,967
or only occasionally placed,

821
00:40:32,487 --> 00:40:35,109
just based on where they're working or what they're doing.

822
00:40:37,308 --> 00:40:38,989
But how does this relate to expression,

823
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:41,230
and how can we separate them in a clear and easy way?

824
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:44,071
Well, when we think of expression versus enrichment,

825
00:40:44,331 --> 00:40:45,912
one of the best places that you can look to,

826
00:40:46,572 --> 00:40:49,113
to understand how those pieces might differ,

827
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:53,515
is to go to an interior design show that deals with a place

828
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:55,516
where they need to sell a house.

829
00:40:57,197 --> 00:40:58,978
Because in many of those situations,

830
00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:00,958
people are trying to make sure that they

831
00:41:01,364 --> 00:41:05,788
remove their personal expression, their identity within that space,

832
00:41:06,429 --> 00:41:08,050
and create a space that's purely enriched,

833
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:10,452
and just visually pleasing to move within.

834
00:41:10,472 --> 00:41:14,596
The first example here has a ton of expression within it.

835
00:41:15,917 --> 00:41:18,499
But somebody may not want to buy that, so they want the simplified space.

836
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,142
One space is not necessarily ugly or bad.

837
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:27,307
It is simply too identifiable for the expression of the person within.

838
00:41:28,372 --> 00:41:30,973
And the next space is, again, not necessarily better per se,

839
00:41:31,794 --> 00:41:35,717
but it is focusing on a lack of identity within that space.

840
00:41:37,618 --> 00:41:39,840
To recap, when we're thinking about expression,

841
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,021
we want to think about world expression,

842
00:41:42,982 --> 00:41:44,483
and we want to ask ourselves about the questions

843
00:41:44,503 --> 00:41:45,263
within that space.

844
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,325
What is its historical relevance,

845
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:49,206
and what is it expressing about the culture there?

846
00:41:50,387 --> 00:41:51,668
What about the inhabitant expression?

847
00:41:52,248 --> 00:41:54,970
What's their attitude, and what's their sophistication,

848
00:41:55,671 --> 00:41:56,872
and how are they presenting that?

849
00:41:58,862 --> 00:42:00,802
We can also think about the symbolism of the space

850
00:42:00,963 --> 00:42:01,863
and what that's suggesting,

851
00:42:01,923 --> 00:42:04,144
either through the ascending and descending

852
00:42:04,624 --> 00:42:05,765
or the admittance and refusal.

853
00:42:06,845 --> 00:42:08,426
When we see these kinds of images,

854
00:42:08,446 --> 00:42:10,147
we can ask ourselves these kinds of questions

855
00:42:10,507 --> 00:42:12,008
about how they're being expressed.

856
00:42:13,008 --> 00:42:15,529
And we can also then think about how that's being changed

857
00:42:15,569 --> 00:42:16,310
in a space like this.

858
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:20,692
How are they presenting their world history

859
00:42:21,152 --> 00:42:21,752
or their culture?

860
00:42:22,852 --> 00:42:23,673
Are they doing that?

861
00:42:24,093 --> 00:42:24,533
How much?

862
00:42:25,274 --> 00:42:26,094
What's their attitude?

863
00:42:26,374 --> 00:42:27,595
And how much are they presenting that?

864
00:42:30,249 --> 00:42:33,271
So the question is, should we start hiring interior designers?

865
00:42:34,572 --> 00:42:36,694
No. No. Absolutely not.

866
00:42:37,434 --> 00:42:38,956
The fact is, a lot of interior designers

867
00:42:39,536 --> 00:42:40,977
are not necessarily interested in games.

868
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:42,018
That's rather obvious.

869
00:42:42,658 --> 00:42:43,879
They want to make real spaces.

870
00:42:43,959 --> 00:42:47,142
Spaces that actual humans literally walk through and move through.

871
00:42:48,203 --> 00:42:49,824
They don't necessarily want to make games.

872
00:42:49,864 --> 00:42:51,285
And some of them aren't good.

873
00:42:52,526 --> 00:42:55,148
Because we're not actually interested in interior designers.

874
00:42:55,928 --> 00:42:57,550
We're interested in interior design.

875
00:42:58,731 --> 00:42:59,931
Instead, you should read a book.

876
00:43:01,117 --> 00:43:03,218
In fact, most of the information that I got for this talk

877
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:04,819
came from this book.

878
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,321
Interior design's always really interested me.

879
00:43:07,702 --> 00:43:11,084
This is a university level interior design textbook.

880
00:43:12,505 --> 00:43:14,287
And it's probably one of the best sources of information

881
00:43:14,327 --> 00:43:16,488
I've seen talking about techniques

882
00:43:17,349 --> 00:43:19,290
that I'd never heard anybody talk about before,

883
00:43:20,491 --> 00:43:21,612
which was incredibly powerful.

884
00:43:22,453 --> 00:43:24,975
I've seen these things, and no doubt many of you here

885
00:43:25,515 --> 00:43:27,516
have already thought about these techniques themselves,

886
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:30,799
but have not necessarily seen it articulated.

887
00:43:31,691 --> 00:43:33,172
And all of that comes from this book.

888
00:43:34,673 --> 00:43:35,874
Because interior design can give us

889
00:43:35,954 --> 00:43:37,115
so many, so many useful things.

890
00:43:37,135 --> 00:43:38,556
This book, it's fantastic.

891
00:43:41,438 --> 00:43:44,280
However, it's also really dry.

892
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,882
It's really boring, because it's very, very technical,

893
00:43:48,263 --> 00:43:50,704
which is fantastic for giving us a foundation

894
00:43:50,724 --> 00:43:54,307
of understanding for how we create and manipulate space.

895
00:43:55,167 --> 00:43:56,748
To increase somebody's appreciation of it.

896
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:00,111
But, what about exteriors?

897
00:44:01,495 --> 00:44:02,796
Well, check architecture.

898
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:06,618
Look into the core ideas of how people build spaces.

899
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:09,679
City planning is also fantastic for this as well.

900
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,741
Actually diving into these different areas

901
00:44:13,201 --> 00:44:14,741
is equally as relevant.

902
00:44:14,982 --> 00:44:16,582
If you're dealing with a city space,

903
00:44:17,483 --> 00:44:18,923
anything like watchdogs.

904
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:22,175
or any kind of like GTA type scenario,

905
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:25,877
city planning, exploration is incredibly powerful.

906
00:44:26,518 --> 00:44:28,359
Otherwise, we have to bash our heads

907
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:30,940
against the same problems over and over again,

908
00:44:31,721 --> 00:44:32,961
and then we would bring somebody new on.

909
00:44:34,002 --> 00:44:35,583
It's harder for us to explain those things

910
00:44:35,623 --> 00:44:36,724
in a clear and coherent way,

911
00:44:37,144 --> 00:44:38,965
or to just give them a book

912
00:44:39,025 --> 00:44:40,386
and have them watch it themselves.

913
00:44:41,827 --> 00:44:44,668
But, with all these rules, they gotta break them.

914
00:44:45,853 --> 00:44:49,975
They're very useful for us to give ourselves a foundational understanding of what we're working with.

915
00:44:50,835 --> 00:44:52,436
But we always need to break rules.

916
00:44:52,916 --> 00:44:59,018
We always need to change what we're doing to ensure that we're not just sticking with static ideas,

917
00:44:59,158 --> 00:45:03,120
but instead expanding on them, breaking them to see the result.

918
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,481
But if we don't start with rules, we don't know what we're breaking.

919
00:45:09,422 --> 00:45:13,443
To recap, we want to think about order and enrichment and expression.

920
00:45:14,484 --> 00:45:14,964
Order being...

921
00:45:15,371 --> 00:45:18,152
how we create orientation and spatial definition,

922
00:45:18,712 --> 00:45:20,352
how we set someone within a space

923
00:45:20,833 --> 00:45:22,713
and keep them from being confused and lost.

924
00:45:23,833 --> 00:45:25,654
Enrichment, dealing with approachability,

925
00:45:26,534 --> 00:45:28,595
spatial composition and closing surfaces,

926
00:45:29,975 --> 00:45:32,256
surface articulation, novelty, and tension.

927
00:45:33,556 --> 00:45:35,717
These things can elevate the experience

928
00:45:35,757 --> 00:45:36,837
of being inside of a space,

929
00:45:37,277 --> 00:45:39,118
can make it just a little bit more interesting

930
00:45:39,158 --> 00:45:42,799
to dive into, regardless of what our content itself might be.

931
00:45:43,979 --> 00:45:44,540
An expression.

932
00:45:44,996 --> 00:45:49,400
deals with that of the world's expression, its inhabitants, and their symbolism.

933
00:45:50,821 --> 00:45:54,764
And every time we look at these things, we can relay these questions back to ourselves.

934
00:45:55,284 --> 00:45:55,805
Yeah, that's fun.

935
00:45:56,685 --> 00:45:59,808
We can relay these things back to ourselves through questions.

936
00:46:00,949 --> 00:46:06,813
Coming back to this scene, keeping in mind all of these ideas, what kind of orientation

937
00:46:06,874 --> 00:46:07,574
is being created?

938
00:46:07,994 --> 00:46:09,516
How are they dealing with spatial definition?

939
00:46:11,017 --> 00:46:11,357
How are they...

940
00:46:12,282 --> 00:46:15,362
separating different areas down there through the elements within.

941
00:46:16,723 --> 00:46:19,423
What kind of space is implied and what's fully defined?

942
00:46:20,324 --> 00:46:22,304
What's the expression that you're seeing in here?

943
00:46:23,545 --> 00:46:25,105
You can tell something about the people here.

944
00:46:25,765 --> 00:46:28,366
And how is it creating tension as we move through this space?

945
00:46:28,706 --> 00:46:30,526
What's the feeling of tension that you're getting from it?

946
00:46:31,127 --> 00:46:33,327
Is it positive, negative? How are they releasing it?

947
00:46:35,768 --> 00:46:37,808
How are they using surface articulation, novelty,

948
00:46:38,809 --> 00:46:40,449
to increase our sense of orientation?

949
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:43,631
How are they manipulating the enclosing surfaces

950
00:46:43,671 --> 00:46:44,871
through something like that staircase?

951
00:46:46,332 --> 00:46:48,173
Each area here is relatively novel.

952
00:46:48,753 --> 00:46:50,554
It's separating out every floor.

953
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,635
And each space says something

954
00:46:53,655 --> 00:46:54,755
about the inhabitants as well.

955
00:46:55,716 --> 00:46:56,956
We can always start to get an idea

956
00:46:57,076 --> 00:46:59,257
of who these people are through that expression.

957
00:47:00,958 --> 00:47:03,359
Each area in this has a form of enrichment,

958
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,100
order, and expression in it.

959
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:07,961
The mystery that's created within each area

960
00:47:08,481 --> 00:47:09,762
and the novelty that's created here.

961
00:47:10,681 --> 00:47:14,606
And this space is full of expression built on top of everything else.

962
00:47:16,007 --> 00:47:19,552
When we ask ourselves about what methods we're seeing them use here,

963
00:47:20,753 --> 00:47:23,497
we can gain a better sense of understanding what we're doing.

964
00:47:24,638 --> 00:47:29,224
When we understand these things, we can master space, so we can master place.

965
00:47:30,285 --> 00:47:30,525
Thank you.

966
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:47,466
So, given the time, I think we've got totally time for questions, if anybody has any questions.

967
00:47:55,091 --> 00:47:55,311
Cool.

968
00:47:55,732 --> 00:47:56,172
Oh, yeah.

969
00:47:56,192 --> 00:47:59,795
So, I'm glad you mentioned the HGTV thing, because it's kind of a guilty pleasure of

970
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:00,355
mine, right?

971
00:48:00,375 --> 00:48:00,615
Yeah, yeah.

972
00:48:00,635 --> 00:48:02,156
So, I can relate to someone.

973
00:48:02,637 --> 00:48:05,979
Are there any other kind of shows you spotted on there that you'd suggest, like, if you

974
00:48:06,019 --> 00:48:08,721
want to do additional research or anything like that, specific?

975
00:48:09,347 --> 00:48:17,012
Totally. Yeah, last year my talk kind of really heavily deals with HDTV in a very overt way.

976
00:48:18,493 --> 00:48:25,677
The two that are really, really useful that I found are Sarah 101 is a really good one as an interior design show that covers some of these topics.

977
00:48:26,598 --> 00:48:29,280
And Pure Design. The thing I find useful is...

978
00:48:30,462 --> 00:48:33,523
having some of this fundamental understanding and some of these other details,

979
00:48:33,964 --> 00:48:37,546
you can start to see how they apply those techniques without necessarily referencing them

980
00:48:38,286 --> 00:48:39,867
within all the spaces that they're working with.

981
00:48:40,688 --> 00:48:42,629
I find them incredibly useful to check out.

982
00:48:43,149 --> 00:48:48,552
This is like real, like core, really bare bones, first level kind of understandings,

983
00:48:48,933 --> 00:48:51,894
and to see how people use those ideas is, to me, always really useful.

984
00:48:52,815 --> 00:48:53,896
Yeah?

985
00:48:53,916 --> 00:48:58,118
Hi. Are there any spaces, like, that you can think of, like, in the world that,

986
00:48:58,418 --> 00:48:59,519
like, I could look up that would be...

987
00:49:00,321 --> 00:49:04,547
that you think really embody all of these fantastic interior designs?

988
00:49:06,149 --> 00:49:08,672
In terms of like games or...

989
00:49:08,853 --> 00:49:14,320
No, like real-world spaces that you think are very good at, you know, expression and orientation and things like that.

990
00:49:15,256 --> 00:49:18,097
It's a really good question and I can't think of a specific example for it.

991
00:49:19,177 --> 00:49:22,878
A lot of times that's why I try to break these things down into questions so that when I'm

992
00:49:22,898 --> 00:49:27,780
seeing something it's mostly about even just your own experience within a space, walking

993
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:34,301
through it and trying to remember where was I a minute ago and when you experience that

994
00:49:34,321 --> 00:49:36,422
in a space simply being aware of these things can be helpful.

995
00:49:37,311 --> 00:49:39,394
because you can see, oh I remember where I was,

996
00:49:40,215 --> 00:49:42,037
and now that I think about it, it's because they had like

997
00:49:42,378 --> 00:49:44,040
a specific interesting picture on a wall.

998
00:49:44,921 --> 00:49:47,124
And sometimes that creates that identity and that structure.

999
00:49:47,925 --> 00:49:50,007
Those are the best things I can suggest.

1000
00:49:51,609 --> 00:49:52,090
I would look up...

1001
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,882
some of the, ideally some of the best interior designers.

1002
00:49:56,182 --> 00:49:58,284
Even just look up, Wikipedia's pretty good for it too.

1003
00:49:59,264 --> 00:50:03,588
For checking out, I think Frank Gehry is a fantastic,

1004
00:50:04,068 --> 00:50:05,790
fantastic, unbelievably good interior designer.

1005
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:08,872
And he creates some pretty unbelievable spaces

1006
00:50:09,653 --> 00:50:11,574
that are probably one of the best spots to start with.

1007
00:50:11,855 --> 00:50:13,056
Okay, Frank Gehry, you said?

1008
00:50:13,536 --> 00:50:14,137
Frank Gehry.

1009
00:50:14,397 --> 00:50:14,917
Okay.

1010
00:50:15,177 --> 00:50:17,339
Yeah, he also, the book as well,

1011
00:50:17,439 --> 00:50:19,901
also talks a lot about very specific interior designers.

1012
00:50:21,162 --> 00:50:21,903
Excellent talk, thank you.

1013
00:50:22,163 --> 00:50:22,363
Thank you.

1014
00:50:24,474 --> 00:50:30,019
Hi, to what extent does the way a player is going to move through a space influence the

1015
00:50:30,039 --> 00:50:31,320
way you're going to do interior design?

1016
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:36,325
So I'm thinking about something like Myst, where you're stepping through a space in a

1017
00:50:36,365 --> 00:50:40,589
very static fashion versus a more fluid, more modern sort of game.

1018
00:50:41,129 --> 00:50:41,790
Totally.

1019
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:42,811
I think with something like Myst...

1020
00:50:43,751 --> 00:50:49,298
We really are more dealing with specific, somewhat more static compositions.

1021
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:52,582
It could certainly still deal with a lot of interior design, for sure.

1022
00:50:54,888 --> 00:50:58,610
I feel like that one almost becomes a little bit more of an in-between, where you really

1023
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:04,012
want to focus on static compositions and two-dimensional composition, and then also inform it a little

1024
00:51:04,032 --> 00:51:08,814
bit with how you define space and how you deal with that, because that can start to

1025
00:51:08,834 --> 00:51:12,535
help how you might move through space, especially if the camera is in any of those situations.

1026
00:51:12,655 --> 00:51:15,036
If it does pan and move, that's where it's most useful.

1027
00:51:15,276 --> 00:51:18,958
If it's the static compositions for a lot of adventure games, then I wouldn't bother,

1028
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:23,940
because two-dimensional composition there is more important and more powerful.

1029
00:51:24,684 --> 00:51:24,969
Thank you.

1030
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:25,192
Thanks.

1031
00:51:27,578 --> 00:51:31,380
Hi, I'm Lee Bretschneider. I'm the lead artist on Temple of Yog.

1032
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,441
So I'm doing the sprites and the environment design.

1033
00:51:35,081 --> 00:51:36,902
And it's a procedurally generated map.

1034
00:51:37,002 --> 00:51:38,382
And going into it, it was kind of like,

1035
00:51:38,962 --> 00:51:42,003
oh, well, you know, disorientation is kind of the factor.

1036
00:51:42,504 --> 00:51:44,304
So we don't really need to worry about it.

1037
00:51:44,344 --> 00:51:49,646
But we actually found that compartmentalization was really crucial to the game.

1038
00:51:49,786 --> 00:51:53,607
And just designing little spaces that are then procedurally introduced

1039
00:51:53,728 --> 00:51:55,608
will reinforce that sense of orientation.

1040
00:51:56,609 --> 00:52:02,133
Even if you're working on something that's procedurally generated, I think that all of these concepts are really, really valuable to put in your game.

1041
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:03,434
Awesome. I totally agree.

1042
00:52:03,914 --> 00:52:04,895
Thank you. Great talk.

1043
00:52:04,915 --> 00:52:07,197
Thank you.

1044
00:52:07,297 --> 00:52:12,801
I'm a level designer, game designer, and arguably designers should have this kind of background as well.

1045
00:52:13,001 --> 00:52:13,142
Yes.

1046
00:52:13,182 --> 00:52:23,450
But how, as an environment artist, when you have all of these interior design fundamentals built into you, and you're working with a level designer who's largely responsible for blocking it out, how do you guys come to terms with that?

1047
00:52:24,965 --> 00:52:28,148
In situations like that, if you have an understanding of some of these techniques,

1048
00:52:29,028 --> 00:52:31,510
then you really have to collaborate closely with your designers.

1049
00:52:33,311 --> 00:52:41,717
It is the worst kind of situation to have a level artist and a level designer not work together.

1050
00:52:43,427 --> 00:52:45,690
that can really fuck things up and break things.

1051
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:50,076
Because they're so linked,

1052
00:52:50,997 --> 00:52:52,779
order is probably one of the techniques

1053
00:52:52,819 --> 00:52:54,301
that deals most with interior design.

1054
00:52:55,062 --> 00:52:56,644
And, with level design, rather.

1055
00:52:57,225 --> 00:53:01,089
And if they don't have an understanding of that information.

1056
00:53:01,694 --> 00:53:05,377
Which is understandable, a lot of level designers don't, a lot of level artists don't,

1057
00:53:06,378 --> 00:53:08,500
a lot of people don't, unless they're in interior design,

1058
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:12,544
or unless they, like I said, have a ton of really good taste or experience.

1059
00:53:13,344 --> 00:53:15,646
And so, if those people don't work together,

1060
00:53:16,207 --> 00:53:20,531
you're going to have maybe a significant amount of order to a space, at best,

1061
00:53:21,372 --> 00:53:25,215
but then enrichment and expression have to be done by a separate process,

1062
00:53:26,456 --> 00:53:27,798
and they're not separate processes.

1063
00:53:29,052 --> 00:53:35,537
And so a lot of it just has to be a matter of really trying to talk and as much as possible

1064
00:53:35,617 --> 00:53:37,758
educate your designers on these things.

1065
00:53:37,938 --> 00:53:41,040
Because even though at the beginning of this I said, environment artists must understand

1066
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:45,663
this, I also, and many other level designers have agreed with me on this, that they need

1067
00:53:45,703 --> 00:53:46,584
to understand that as well.

1068
00:53:47,004 --> 00:53:48,465
Because it's critical.

1069
00:53:51,718 --> 00:54:09,431
Hi. I don't know if it's an old question, but in some game that I've played, I noticed that some environments seem like too wide or too high, or the height of doors don't correlate with the wideness of the rooms, and I don't know if that's something that it's intentional, or that it's a lack of interior design.

1070
00:54:10,532 --> 00:54:18,898
My suggestion would be when you're seeing something like that, is acknowledging your experience within it, and seeing, okay, well...

1071
00:54:19,771 --> 00:54:22,152
If it is too high, or if it feels too high,

1072
00:54:23,272 --> 00:54:24,992
how does that relate to some of the other techniques?

1073
00:54:25,352 --> 00:54:27,373
Like what kind of enclosure are we getting out of this space?

1074
00:54:27,413 --> 00:54:29,313
So for example, this room is really, really tall.

1075
00:54:30,994 --> 00:54:32,894
Is that what kind of experience are

1076
00:54:32,914 --> 00:54:34,034
we getting within that space?

1077
00:54:34,114 --> 00:54:36,095
Does that height create something

1078
00:54:36,115 --> 00:54:36,915
that's interesting for us?

1079
00:54:37,015 --> 00:54:38,375
Each of us are going to feel differently about it.

1080
00:54:39,535 --> 00:54:41,576
But to address and ask those questions about it,

1081
00:54:42,116 --> 00:54:43,756
I think are the most useful thing that you can do.

1082
00:54:44,377 --> 00:54:46,557
Because even though we've got like rules and techniques

1083
00:54:46,597 --> 00:54:48,558
and specific ideas, it doesn't necessarily

1084
00:54:48,598 --> 00:54:48,898
make this.

1085
00:54:50,999 --> 00:54:53,281
entirely not subjective.

1086
00:54:54,121 --> 00:54:56,263
We just gain a little bit more objectivity,

1087
00:54:56,983 --> 00:54:59,565
but that's it, it's still crazy subjective.

1088
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:02,107
So if you experience that this place feels too tall,

1089
00:55:02,748 --> 00:55:04,389
then try to break down some of the other techniques

1090
00:55:04,429 --> 00:55:06,350
and think about how are they dealing with enclosure?

1091
00:55:07,191 --> 00:55:08,932
Does the space feel too tall simply because

1092
00:55:09,052 --> 00:55:11,894
I'm really small in it, or that the spatial composition

1093
00:55:11,914 --> 00:55:14,096
of the elements within feel really big

1094
00:55:14,136 --> 00:55:14,937
in comparison to that?

1095
00:55:16,177 --> 00:55:20,800
That's how you can start to like break down your feelings within that space

1096
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:25,463
So that you don't necessarily have to resort to cliches of just going well the space should be smaller

1097
00:55:26,063 --> 00:55:30,545
Because maybe it shouldn't maybe this room is great as tall as it is because we get these big things

1098
00:55:30,765 --> 00:55:36,028
Yeah, exactly. Maybe that's where that starts to work, but me up here looking that way it just looks too tall

1099
00:55:36,929 --> 00:55:38,290
Okay, thank you. Thanks

1100
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:43,586
Hi, I'm Luke Anderson, Double Down Casino Online.

1101
00:55:43,626 --> 00:55:46,907
I wanted to ask you about the kind of nexus between 3D

1102
00:55:47,387 --> 00:55:51,368
composition and 2D composition as it pertains to user

1103
00:55:51,388 --> 00:55:52,588
interface or a HUD.

1104
00:55:53,589 --> 00:55:56,829
You know, when the environment kind of blurs out, the HUD

1105
00:55:56,869 --> 00:56:00,510
comes up, now you're in a 2D experience in that transition?

1106
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:05,231
Well, I think that kind of having that transition.

1107
00:56:06,616 --> 00:56:11,960
is useful, is valuable. I'm not very good with UI. I'm actually pretty terrible with it.

1108
00:56:12,861 --> 00:56:15,923
So I wouldn't want to dive into that too much and pretend like I know, because I don't.

1109
00:56:16,504 --> 00:56:22,088
But, especially in those kind of situations, since the camera is not actually moving through,

1110
00:56:22,909 --> 00:56:28,834
or changing where that element is, a lot of times I feel like, yeah, you want to focus on

1111
00:56:29,014 --> 00:56:31,936
two-dimensional composition, because that's what's most effective for that.

1112
00:56:33,317 --> 00:56:37,378
For interior design, it really is about moving through a space,

1113
00:56:38,078 --> 00:56:39,819
and that's where that connection is.

1114
00:56:40,099 --> 00:56:41,659
Every time that that connection is not there,

1115
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:43,780
I feel like interior design is, you know,

1116
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:44,900
it has techniques that are neat,

1117
00:56:45,441 --> 00:56:47,761
but the relevance starts to just drop off.

1118
00:56:49,002 --> 00:56:50,322
It's still cool, it's still interesting,

1119
00:56:50,582 --> 00:56:52,923
but it's not directly applicable,

1120
00:56:53,483 --> 00:56:55,484
and that's where I think you can start focusing

1121
00:56:55,544 --> 00:56:58,165
on other kinds of techniques and other fields

1122
00:56:58,805 --> 00:56:59,765
to draw that information from,

1123
00:56:59,785 --> 00:57:01,066
like graphic design and stuff like that.

1124
00:57:02,501 --> 00:57:02,621
Cool.

1125
00:57:02,781 --> 00:57:03,702
Did that answer that question?

1126
00:57:04,122 --> 00:57:04,202
Yeah.

1127
00:57:04,222 --> 00:57:04,742
A little bit broad.

1128
00:57:05,183 --> 00:57:07,484
No, it was a broad question, so that's great.

1129
00:57:07,864 --> 00:57:07,964
Cool.

1130
00:57:08,064 --> 00:57:08,345
Thank you.

1131
00:57:10,046 --> 00:57:12,647
What suggestions do you have for building interesting spaces

1132
00:57:12,687 --> 00:57:15,389
when you have a limited asset list or pattern list?

1133
00:57:15,409 --> 00:57:16,890
Like if you're building off of a texture page,

1134
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:19,692
you may only have two carpet patterns.

1135
00:57:19,712 --> 00:57:21,433
You only may have one couch type.

1136
00:57:21,953 --> 00:57:24,715
So how do you suggest building spaces with interest

1137
00:57:24,755 --> 00:57:27,056
when you do have that limitation?

1138
00:57:28,811 --> 00:57:33,532
I mean, oftentimes those limitations can be useful, but then you start to try to, I would

1139
00:57:33,572 --> 00:57:37,153
suggest probably resorting to things like, without knowing more information about the

1140
00:57:37,173 --> 00:57:42,275
space, try to resort to certain things like, because you can't really deal with surface

1141
00:57:42,295 --> 00:57:47,057
articulation in the same way, if you can't add more assets, but maybe dealing with how

1142
00:57:47,137 --> 00:57:51,058
you manipulate that enclosing surface, creating curves where you can't normally.

1143
00:57:52,345 --> 00:57:55,747
In fact, interior design is very good for dealing with limitations,

1144
00:57:56,047 --> 00:57:58,969
because they've always got limitations of budgets and materials.

1145
00:57:59,109 --> 00:58:03,571
So if they want a really sexy, cool surface, that costs something.

1146
00:58:03,731 --> 00:58:07,553
That costs a lot more than a boring, uninteresting surface.

1147
00:58:08,691 --> 00:58:10,352
So they're really good with limitations.

1148
00:58:10,952 --> 00:58:13,954
And I would suggest dealing with perceptible patterns

1149
00:58:13,974 --> 00:58:14,674
within that space.

1150
00:58:15,295 --> 00:58:18,236
So the assets themselves would normally create more novelty.

1151
00:58:19,077 --> 00:58:20,858
But since you have that limited palette of assets,

1152
00:58:21,098 --> 00:58:24,420
you have a limited palette of novelty of objects.

1153
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:28,082
And so you just try to rearrange them in different patterns

1154
00:58:28,302 --> 00:58:29,543
and different areas.

1155
00:58:30,263 --> 00:58:34,687
so that you're getting at least some form of coherence and legibility

1156
00:58:35,327 --> 00:58:38,009
and creating little movement paths that people can work through.

1157
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:42,933
Maybe it's not necessarily visually enriching and expressive that way,

1158
00:58:43,754 --> 00:58:46,556
but it might be at least enriching to move through.

1159
00:58:46,576 --> 00:58:48,358
Okay. Thank you.

1160
00:58:48,818 --> 00:58:48,998
Thanks.

1161
00:58:54,314 --> 00:58:57,557
So one thing I was wondering, you know, going back to like the question on,

1162
00:58:57,577 --> 00:59:01,962
hey, how do we communicate with people who may not have the same information as,

1163
00:59:02,202 --> 00:59:03,263
you know, you're expressing here?

1164
00:59:03,964 --> 00:59:07,407
You know, often you're talking about a space with, you know, a big group of

1165
00:59:07,427 --> 00:59:08,849
people, let's say you're viewing a level.

1166
00:59:09,149 --> 00:59:12,533
Do you have any like tips on how to communicate fundamental issues that you

1167
00:59:12,593 --> 00:59:15,676
see, like with interior design to people that may not.

1168
00:59:16,457 --> 00:59:19,877
understand why, you know, order is important in a scene.

1169
00:59:19,937 --> 00:59:21,377
You know, so if you're making a busy street,

1170
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:23,678
you know, you're like, okay, let's throw in a bunch of stuff.

1171
00:59:23,698 --> 00:59:26,258
How many assets can we fit in the street to make it look like a busy street?

1172
00:59:26,278 --> 00:59:26,778
Mm-hmm.

1173
00:59:27,278 --> 00:59:30,359
Obviously that can affect, you know, the things we're talking about today.

1174
00:59:31,899 --> 00:59:33,940
Um, again, I think the only...

1175
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,900
I'm actually realizing this will have to be the last question

1176
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:36,780
because I just looked at the time.

1177
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,941
Um, I think when it comes to that, when it comes to education,

1178
00:59:42,241 --> 00:59:44,201
all I can think to do is to just keep talking about it.

1179
00:59:45,042 --> 00:59:45,122
Um...

1180
00:59:45,722 --> 00:59:48,324
That's kind of why I wanted to do this talk, because I found it was interesting and useful,

1181
00:59:48,364 --> 00:59:49,925
and would hopefully help people.

1182
00:59:51,086 --> 00:59:52,887
And I think that's all that you can really do,

1183
00:59:53,828 --> 00:59:57,451
is implement it, show it, and talk about the techniques that you're using.

1184
00:59:58,191 --> 01:00:01,213
There's a lot of really specific terms in here, and I kind of wanted to keep them,

1185
01:00:01,894 --> 01:00:05,116
because for us, that gives us a vocabulary to work with.

1186
01:00:06,077 --> 01:00:07,237
when we're talking about spaces.

1187
01:00:07,557 --> 01:00:10,258
So, when we stay consistent with some of that language,

1188
01:00:10,918 --> 01:00:12,798
we can understand that when we're pointing to something

1189
01:00:12,838 --> 01:00:15,259
and going, hey, this scene, it's interesting,

1190
01:00:15,299 --> 01:00:16,679
but it's kind of lacking coherence.

1191
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:19,220
As long as we can repeat that thing,

1192
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,500
if someone goes, what the fuck are you talking about,

1193
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:22,681
coherence, you can go, well, this is what I'm talking about.

1194
01:00:23,421 --> 01:00:26,162
And you can keep that kind of like clear line of language

1195
01:00:26,362 --> 01:00:28,402
so that people can understand what the criticism means

1196
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:32,063
so that we don't rely on, can you make it more detailed?

1197
01:00:33,009 --> 01:00:34,591
Because I know I've done that a lot of times.

1198
01:00:36,052 --> 01:00:39,035
So keeping some of that language consistent

1199
01:00:39,175 --> 01:00:40,857
and explaining what each part might mean

1200
01:00:41,057 --> 01:00:44,380
when you're talking about it can be hugely helpful, I find.

1201
01:00:46,162 --> 01:00:46,422
