00:00:07,659 --> 00:00:11,600
Hello and welcome to the Game Art Remastered panel,

2
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,161
featuring Brian Sousa from Blizzard Entertainment

3
00:00:15,201 --> 00:00:16,442
talking about StarCraft Remastered,

4
00:00:17,242 --> 00:00:19,723
Corey from Vicarious Visions will be talking about Crash

5
00:00:19,783 --> 00:00:22,764
Bandicoot, and Eugene will be talking, oh, from Shiny Shoe

6
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:24,364
will be talking about Full Throttle.

7
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:29,886
I'm going to start this one off with StarCraft Remastered.

8
00:00:31,747 --> 00:00:33,247
There's a lot of questions people

9
00:00:33,307 --> 00:00:37,168
have about why we would remaster a game, for instance.

10
00:00:37,987 --> 00:00:39,067
Why would you remaster a game?

11
00:00:40,428 --> 00:00:41,289
I'll talk a little bit on that,

12
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:43,330
and mostly about how we did it.

13
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,031
And there we go.

14
00:00:47,312 --> 00:00:47,933
This is not working.

15
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:49,093
There we go.

16
00:00:50,674 --> 00:00:52,015
So most of you probably don't remember

17
00:00:52,055 --> 00:00:54,056
the good old days of the 1990s.

18
00:00:54,717 --> 00:00:57,038
Blizzard had just hit two pretty successful games

19
00:00:57,058 --> 00:00:58,519
with Warcraft I and Warcraft II.

20
00:00:59,515 --> 00:01:02,015
And while we did think about other games that we could develop,

21
00:01:02,555 --> 00:01:04,576
another RTS was inevitable.

22
00:01:05,496 --> 00:01:08,416
What we did though is we switched genres altogether

23
00:01:08,616 --> 00:01:13,377
from fantasies to science fiction, and we added a third race.

24
00:01:13,817 --> 00:01:17,298
So we have the Stoic Terrans, the Enigmatic Protoss,

25
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:19,238
and the Swarms of Zerg.

26
00:01:19,258 --> 00:01:21,879
A little bit about StarCraft.

27
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:24,699
It was about a three-year development cycle.

28
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:27,260
We took a little time off for Diablo, if you remember that.

29
00:01:28,272 --> 00:01:30,332
and it was released in the spring of 1998.

30
00:01:31,612 --> 00:01:33,012
Brood War was released later that year,

31
00:01:34,773 --> 00:01:36,733
and this was actually the formation

32
00:01:36,893 --> 00:01:38,513
of a dedicated cinematic team.

33
00:01:39,414 --> 00:01:41,474
I should know, I was there.

34
00:01:41,994 --> 00:01:44,734
I'm on the top row, still bald, still angry.

35
00:01:45,575 --> 00:01:46,755
Just kidding.

36
00:01:46,795 --> 00:01:51,036
20 years later, 20 pounds later, and that's me now.

37
00:01:52,556 --> 00:01:54,896
Blizzard has released many new games

38
00:01:55,176 --> 00:01:56,237
since StarCraft had come out.

39
00:01:58,777 --> 00:02:01,458
But the fact is that millions of people are still playing StarCraft 1.

40
00:02:02,798 --> 00:02:06,259
Hundreds of tournaments, professional tournaments, have been played.

41
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:13,402
The players have recreated and reimagined our editors to create new maps.

42
00:02:14,082 --> 00:02:18,763
And they've even set up private servers so they could play games with matchmaking and ladders.

43
00:02:20,955 --> 00:02:24,478
This was a picture from Busan when we released the remaster,

44
00:02:24,698 --> 00:02:29,683
and around 30,000 people showed up for our announcement,

45
00:02:29,703 --> 00:02:33,266
that's not the announcement, the release of StarCraft Remastered.

46
00:02:34,727 --> 00:02:37,189
However, we felt that it is actually our duty

47
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,733
to keep these games alive, keep them up to date

48
00:02:40,933 --> 00:02:42,915
and accessible to all of our players.

49
00:02:43,215 --> 00:02:46,518
And so, the Blizzard Classic Games team was formed.

50
00:02:47,363 --> 00:02:52,988
I came on the team about two years ago, and I was focusing mainly on StarCraft Remastered.

51
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:58,473
I had worked on the original, so they felt that my expertise would be invaluable.

52
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:03,917
StarCraft was released at 640x480 resolution.

53
00:03:04,698 --> 00:03:08,781
It had 256 color palette and an amazing 15 frames per second.

54
00:03:09,762 --> 00:03:14,767
But it did have 8-player multiplayer, and that is what helped StarCraft become what

55
00:03:14,787 --> 00:03:15,267
it is today.

56
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:23,394
So when we look back at what we were going to do with bringing StarCraft into our current

57
00:03:23,434 --> 00:03:30,018
battle plan, battle platform I should say, of Battle.net, we talked to the community

58
00:03:31,059 --> 00:03:32,039
and the professional players.

59
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,781
We said, hey, what would you like to see?

60
00:03:37,903 --> 00:03:38,703
What could we fix?

61
00:03:39,284 --> 00:03:40,444
There's bugs in the game still.

62
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:42,646
And what changes could we make?

63
00:03:43,652 --> 00:03:47,975
Well, a lot of it we suspected, and a lot of it was surprising.

64
00:03:48,455 --> 00:03:51,558
For instance, we knew we shouldn't touch the gameplay.

65
00:03:52,058 --> 00:03:53,680
The game has been played for 20 years.

66
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,101
Everybody loves the game as it is.

67
00:03:56,682 --> 00:03:57,382
It's like chess.

68
00:03:57,723 --> 00:03:59,524
You can change the board, you can change the pieces,

69
00:03:59,564 --> 00:04:01,606
but don't change the rules or how it plays.

70
00:04:03,147 --> 00:04:04,268
Don't fix the bugs.

71
00:04:04,848 --> 00:04:06,930
The bugs are incorporated into the gameplay now,

72
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:10,533
and these players require these bugs.

73
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:13,732
They like these bugs, they know, and they work around these bugs,

74
00:04:13,772 --> 00:04:15,053
and that's what makes a master player.

75
00:04:16,654 --> 00:04:18,114
There was one bug we fixed, however.

76
00:04:19,595 --> 00:04:21,616
Early in the development, Mike Morheim came to us,

77
00:04:21,796 --> 00:04:25,518
and he mentioned that there was a bug in that he introduced back in 1997,

78
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:31,221
and it was just an animation that played one frame out of order,

79
00:04:31,941 --> 00:04:32,922
and it really bugged him.

80
00:04:33,182 --> 00:04:36,043
And so we actually said, okay, we'll fix that bug for you.

81
00:04:36,163 --> 00:04:37,964
It doesn't have anything to do with gameplay. We're good.

82
00:04:39,672 --> 00:04:41,253
And don't change the look.

83
00:04:42,674 --> 00:04:44,196
This was kind of surprising to us.

84
00:04:44,876 --> 00:04:49,099
But the fact that StarCraft looked a certain way

85
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,961
was really key to the players.

86
00:04:53,642 --> 00:04:57,805
So this led us to say, well, what can we do with the remaster?

87
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:03,109
And my boss came to us, and he basically

88
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:05,711
told us, don't screw it up.

89
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:09,575
Because this game has been played for so long,

90
00:05:09,595 --> 00:05:11,756
so many people love this game, still playing this game,

91
00:05:12,176 --> 00:05:14,337
that anything we do, we can't screw it up,

92
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:18,219
which also gives us a lot to work with.

93
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,480
So we started thinking about what our options could be.

94
00:05:22,341 --> 00:05:23,161
What if we did this?

95
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:26,263
Well, we want to bring it up to 4K resolution,

96
00:05:26,763 --> 00:05:28,263
future-proofing it so in 20 years

97
00:05:28,303 --> 00:05:30,084
we're not revisiting all of these assets again,

98
00:05:30,624 --> 00:05:31,185
redoing them.

99
00:05:32,045 --> 00:05:33,906
We put in 16 by 9 widescreen support.

100
00:05:35,212 --> 00:05:36,813
Integration into Battle.net was key.

101
00:05:36,853 --> 00:05:40,315
That brings you up into today's player base.

102
00:05:41,495 --> 00:05:43,977
Seamlessly playable with the standard version,

103
00:05:44,737 --> 00:05:47,839
which was a huge undertaking to make that possible.

104
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:52,301
We wanted to put in new lighting, additional ramp

105
00:05:52,321 --> 00:05:54,902
directions, additional animation frames.

106
00:05:55,663 --> 00:05:58,544
And my personal, because I worked on the Cinemax,

107
00:05:58,584 --> 00:06:01,105
I really wanted to update them for today.

108
00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:04,767
However, not all of these were possible.

109
00:06:06,624 --> 00:06:08,185
But we were able to up-res the graphics.

110
00:06:08,745 --> 00:06:12,388
Problems were we had no original assets to work from.

111
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:16,590
We found a CD that one of the artists had burned

112
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,072
that had assets from early games,

113
00:06:19,152 --> 00:06:21,833
Diablo, Starcraft, Warcraft II,

114
00:06:22,574 --> 00:06:24,035
and I was able to find a few models.

115
00:06:24,595 --> 00:06:25,836
They didn't have any textures on them

116
00:06:26,576 --> 00:06:29,178
and they were very rough, to say the least.

117
00:06:31,315 --> 00:06:32,496
We didn't have any art tools.

118
00:06:32,877 --> 00:06:34,058
All of the tools were gone.

119
00:06:34,358 --> 00:06:35,859
So we had to rewrite the art tools.

120
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:38,661
And basically what we did was we extracted

121
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:42,104
all of the original assets and then scaled them up 400%

122
00:06:42,184 --> 00:06:44,446
to see what kind of resolution we're working with.

123
00:06:45,987 --> 00:06:47,148
And when we did this, we found out

124
00:06:47,168 --> 00:06:48,809
there's no consistent cameras or lighting.

125
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,791
I don't know what those artists were thinking,

126
00:06:50,891 --> 00:06:53,513
but we had to eyeball everything to make sure

127
00:06:53,553 --> 00:06:56,095
that the perspective was right for the game

128
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,136
and not right for what you would think.

129
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,971
So what did we do?

130
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:03,012
First, we said, let's get our style down.

131
00:07:04,312 --> 00:07:05,673
And we worked with the Battle Cruiser.

132
00:07:05,973 --> 00:07:09,335
The Battle Cruiser is big, it's badass, and it's iconic.

133
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,296
Everybody knows the Battle Cruiser.

134
00:07:12,196 --> 00:07:13,257
So this is our first test.

135
00:07:13,277 --> 00:07:15,978
We set up a huge style guide about how we did it and what

136
00:07:15,998 --> 00:07:16,779
we were going for.

137
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,921
And we showed these to our focus group.

138
00:07:22,682 --> 00:07:23,142
They hated it.

139
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:24,783
It wasn't what they wanted.

140
00:07:25,282 --> 00:07:26,884
They already thought we were screwing up the game,

141
00:07:27,605 --> 00:07:30,070
and so we had to rethink.

142
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,836
And so we came up with a second Battle Cruiser, which, as you

143
00:07:33,876 --> 00:07:35,318
can see, is more in line with the original.

144
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,684
We went back then, and we looked at all of the original.

145
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:45,161
uh... concepts uh... sam didi was awesome he kept everything he's ever drawn ever

146
00:07:45,661 --> 00:07:46,462
in these folders

147
00:07:47,022 --> 00:07:48,543
and so i got a lot of the stuff from him

148
00:07:49,143 --> 00:07:50,244
you can see the zergling had

149
00:07:50,664 --> 00:07:51,644
little arms on his back

150
00:07:52,245 --> 00:07:53,705
the ghost actually has six fingers

151
00:07:54,286 --> 00:07:54,846
which uh...

152
00:07:55,306 --> 00:07:56,987
i really forced into the game somehow

153
00:07:57,647 --> 00:07:58,328
you'll never see it

154
00:07:58,348 --> 00:07:58,388
uh...

155
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:02,970
so this is what we did we took the original asset

156
00:08:03,838 --> 00:08:05,940
And then we did a concept of what kind of details

157
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,221
we would add to this concept.

158
00:08:08,242 --> 00:08:09,243
Where could we go with this?

159
00:08:09,283 --> 00:08:11,085
Just kind of enhancing what was already there,

160
00:08:11,165 --> 00:08:12,125
just filling in the gaps.

161
00:08:12,906 --> 00:08:15,949
And then our final was rendered, and we built off

162
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:18,211
of that final concept so that when you look at the game,

163
00:08:18,251 --> 00:08:20,353
you instantly recognize everything in it.

164
00:08:22,775 --> 00:08:23,376
Animations.

165
00:08:23,456 --> 00:08:25,097
This was one that we really wanted to do.

166
00:08:26,497 --> 00:08:29,118
If you look at StarCraft, the animations are very stiff.

167
00:08:29,138 --> 00:08:31,879
There's not very many frames for any of the things.

168
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,200
Some of them have four or five frames for a complete cycle.

169
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,000
And they're playing this at 15 frames a second.

170
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,321
So they're just repeating frames over and over.

171
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:42,863
We did a test with the Zealot of how it could be.

172
00:08:43,383 --> 00:08:44,964
We added a new idle frame.

173
00:08:45,384 --> 00:08:46,224
We added a new run.

174
00:08:48,144 --> 00:08:50,506
It turns out that this was a little bit too much,

175
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:52,728
and it changed the game, the perception of the game,

176
00:08:52,768 --> 00:08:54,269
of how these units acted.

177
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,711
Some of the professional players actually

178
00:08:56,771 --> 00:08:59,914
would recognize frame three of the Zergling's attack

179
00:08:59,974 --> 00:09:02,256
as when it does the damage, and then it can move it away.

180
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:07,280
So we basically had to scrap our ideas of adding animation.

181
00:09:08,241 --> 00:09:12,985
And speaking of the Zergling, originally we had a man,

182
00:09:13,005 --> 00:09:14,546
and we had a play test.

183
00:09:16,407 --> 00:09:19,710
the professionals felt he felt too small. He was exactly the

184
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,692
same size and it was all perception because we didn't

185
00:09:22,732 --> 00:09:27,456
change the hit test box at all. It's the same one from standard

186
00:09:28,117 --> 00:09:33,681
but because they felt it was smaller, they perceived it that

187
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:37,585
way so we scaled it up a little bit just so they would have a

188
00:09:38,165 --> 00:09:41,748
easier time of it. We were also able to

189
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:43,991
go through the angles.

190
00:09:44,731 --> 00:09:48,834
Originally the game was supposed to have 36, 32 angles?

191
00:09:49,395 --> 00:09:50,856
32 angles, yeah.

192
00:09:51,236 --> 00:09:52,977
But because of memory constraints at the time,

193
00:09:53,418 --> 00:09:56,460
it was cut down to only 16, which is only nine flipped.

194
00:09:57,381 --> 00:09:59,462
So frames one and two, exactly the same.

195
00:09:59,723 --> 00:10:00,964
Three and four, exactly the same.

196
00:10:01,124 --> 00:10:03,125
And we went in and we were able to put

197
00:10:03,165 --> 00:10:04,826
in more angles of rotation.

198
00:10:07,814 --> 00:10:10,377
One of the biggest changes we did was for the lighting.

199
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,602
We have the standard in-game sprite,

200
00:10:13,862 --> 00:10:16,866
which matches almost one-to-one with the originals.

201
00:10:17,447 --> 00:10:20,170
However, we added a new lighting system.

202
00:10:21,105 --> 00:10:24,348
which adds ambient occlusion mapping, depth mapping,

203
00:10:24,608 --> 00:10:26,009
normal mapping, specular map.

204
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,092
And this gives the actual, we have in-game lighting

205
00:10:29,132 --> 00:10:31,954
that can affect these to make it a little more depth,

206
00:10:32,114 --> 00:10:33,896
like a two and a half D representation.

207
00:10:34,456 --> 00:10:36,998
We were actually able to put lights onto units,

208
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,320
and so they kind of glowed

209
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,420
and they would affect the buildings.

210
00:10:41,382 --> 00:10:44,144
And of course, we had to add widescreen support.

211
00:10:45,225 --> 00:10:47,187
Now, you would probably think this is not a big deal.

212
00:10:47,707 --> 00:10:48,888
Change the camera, you're good.

213
00:10:49,635 --> 00:10:51,435
The biggest problem was the consoles.

214
00:10:52,716 --> 00:10:54,116
And the consoles were a pain in the butt.

215
00:10:55,617 --> 00:10:57,617
We had to make them be expandable from 4 by 3

216
00:10:58,298 --> 00:10:58,978
to 16 by 9.

217
00:11:00,338 --> 00:11:03,960
And we worked on these consoles up until ship,

218
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,081
until after ship with feedback from the community.

219
00:11:07,661 --> 00:11:10,902
Because they just weren't feeling right.

220
00:11:11,202 --> 00:11:12,603
So finally, we got something in.

221
00:11:13,043 --> 00:11:14,463
We had these expandable consoles.

222
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:15,484
And I'm happy.

223
00:11:15,664 --> 00:11:16,484
We never have to do it again.

224
00:11:18,781 --> 00:11:19,522
The environments.

225
00:11:20,403 --> 00:11:22,665
As many of the units in the buildings as there were,

226
00:11:22,705 --> 00:11:25,147
there was eight environments that we had to do,

227
00:11:25,447 --> 00:11:27,509
each with thousands of individual cells.

228
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:30,032
And each of these cells had to be put together

229
00:11:30,072 --> 00:11:30,853
like a puzzle piece.

230
00:11:31,473 --> 00:11:33,795
And we had no way of knowing how these things worked.

231
00:11:34,656 --> 00:11:36,398
We actually had to create documents,

232
00:11:36,918 --> 00:11:38,020
and we had the engineers

233
00:11:40,664 --> 00:11:43,425
extract all of the numbers so you could see them on screen,

234
00:11:43,926 --> 00:11:45,687
like which tile goes to which tile.

235
00:11:46,127 --> 00:11:48,129
And there's like just in the tile sets of numbers,

236
00:11:48,169 --> 00:11:50,750
there's 33,000 of these that we had to make sure

237
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:51,631
that all fit together.

238
00:11:54,353 --> 00:11:56,114
And we did add some new water.

239
00:11:56,294 --> 00:11:57,955
The original water was color cycled,

240
00:11:59,036 --> 00:12:00,057
usually with five colors,

241
00:12:00,117 --> 00:12:01,358
and it just kind of rotated through them.

242
00:12:01,838 --> 00:12:04,240
And then we added a new shader to the water,

243
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,501
and I think this was the biggest revamp

244
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:07,762
for the actual graphics.

245
00:12:10,894 --> 00:12:16,975
the ramps. There was only two ramps in StarCraft, uh, Southwest and Southeast, which at the

246
00:12:17,015 --> 00:12:23,257
time seemed like it was okay, right? We didn't expect this to be a huge, um, tournament based

247
00:12:23,717 --> 00:12:29,698
game that's, you know, been played for 20 years. Um, the community stepped up again and

248
00:12:29,718 --> 00:12:35,939
they actually created in the world editor their own ramps using pieces that were already

249
00:12:35,979 --> 00:12:39,920
existing. Well, they were hard to make and they didn't actually fit in that well.

250
00:12:40,645 --> 00:12:44,047
So we took our time, and we put in all new directions.

251
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:45,108
So we added six directions.

252
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:47,310
And all of these are expandable, so you can make

253
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,611
whatever size ramp you want.

254
00:12:49,011 --> 00:12:51,634
And we also put these into the standard definition so that

255
00:12:51,674 --> 00:12:54,876
you can play still with your friends that

256
00:12:54,976 --> 00:12:56,117
didn't get the HD version.

257
00:12:58,931 --> 00:13:00,874
Cinematics, this is what made me sad.

258
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:05,580
Because I think if anything makes it still feel dated

259
00:13:06,321 --> 00:13:07,122
are the cinematics.

260
00:13:07,622 --> 00:13:09,224
And of course, there's the people out there that think,

261
00:13:09,525 --> 00:13:13,230
nostalgia, these cinematics are what

262
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,471
makes StarCraft StarCraft.

263
00:13:15,913 --> 00:13:16,534
I wanted to do.

264
00:13:17,176 --> 00:13:20,039
you know, some updated versions, even cutting them down because,

265
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:24,364
you know, we had 30 minutes plus in Starcraft and Brood War

266
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:25,785
of pre-rendered cinematics.

267
00:13:26,386 --> 00:13:29,389
And it just wasn't feasible in today's age to recreate these.

268
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:34,214
The only thing we were able to do is the story mode.

269
00:13:34,434 --> 00:13:39,019
We had basically text screens that drove the story.

270
00:13:39,775 --> 00:13:42,195
And we went through and we added interstitials that added

271
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:43,876
characters that you know from StarCraft II,

272
00:13:44,336 --> 00:13:45,316
Manx and Kerrigan.

273
00:13:45,876 --> 00:13:47,356
And here's the fall of Phoenix.

274
00:13:47,656 --> 00:13:49,657
And we kind of illustrated these to be a little more

275
00:13:50,117 --> 00:13:51,097
interesting for the story.

276
00:13:52,878 --> 00:13:55,838
So that's pretty much the gist of what

277
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:56,798
we did for StarCraft.

278
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:00,979
I know that don't screw it up isn't much of a mantra to go

279
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:03,420
off of for remastering a game.

280
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,821
But people play this game for a reason.

281
00:14:07,621 --> 00:14:08,761
And we didn't want to screw it up.

282
00:14:09,565 --> 00:14:11,827
Everything we changed or added is an option.

283
00:14:12,788 --> 00:14:14,710
If you don't want the rotation, you can turn that off

284
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,451
in the menu.

285
00:14:16,611 --> 00:14:18,173
If you don't want the lighting, you can turn that off.

286
00:14:18,513 --> 00:14:20,455
If you want to play in standard definition,

287
00:14:20,495 --> 00:14:21,235
you can still do that.

288
00:14:21,255 --> 00:14:22,396
You can play it in four by three.

289
00:14:22,997 --> 00:14:24,338
Everything is optional.

290
00:14:24,478 --> 00:14:26,900
So no matter if you like it or not,

291
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:30,103
it's up to you how much you want to get into it.

292
00:14:32,945 --> 00:14:38,469
That's it. We had no original assets or tools. We had self-imposed guidelines of what we could do,

293
00:14:39,109 --> 00:14:43,492
but we still successfully updated this game without actually breaking it.

294
00:14:44,153 --> 00:14:47,135
StarCraft Remastered was released with much positive feedback,

295
00:14:48,075 --> 00:14:52,318
and we enjoyed a resurgence of interest in a game older than many of its new players.

296
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:57,502
Thanks so much. Next is Corey, and he's going to be speaking about Crash Bandicoot.

297
00:15:05,716 --> 00:15:06,296
Did I hit something?

298
00:15:06,817 --> 00:15:07,417
Sent it to sleep.

299
00:15:08,978 --> 00:15:09,618
What the heck?

300
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:11,479
OK, don't look at my password.

301
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,060
Ha ha ha ha ha.

302
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,623
Nice night, man.

303
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:35,234
Cool.

304
00:15:35,274 --> 00:15:35,474
All right.

305
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:37,445
Hey, good afternoon everybody.

306
00:15:37,966 --> 00:15:38,487
Thank you for coming.

307
00:15:39,127 --> 00:15:41,070
I'm Corey from Vicarious Visions, as Brian said.

308
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,792
I was one of the character artists

309
00:15:42,852 --> 00:15:44,294
on the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy.

310
00:15:45,115 --> 00:15:47,257
And I'll be talking about our approach

311
00:15:47,277 --> 00:15:49,260
to remastering the Crash's characters.

312
00:15:49,961 --> 00:15:51,022
And specifically,

313
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:57,038
the way we thought about our work in the context of the state of the franchise and fans'

314
00:15:57,058 --> 00:16:04,144
expectations. For those not familiar with these games, the Crash Trilogy was created by Naughty

315
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:09,169
Dog for the PlayStation 1 and here's a quick set of clips of our own and the original from our

316
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:09,810
reveal trailer.

317
00:16:11,852 --> 00:16:13,373
So this is from our initial reveal.

318
00:16:13,694 --> 00:16:16,415
Things like some color tuning were not fully dialed in yet.

319
00:16:16,956 --> 00:16:19,838
But what's key to know is that aside from raw geometry

320
00:16:19,898 --> 00:16:22,440
reference for level layouts, our art

321
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,721
was being created from scratch and by eye.

322
00:16:25,622 --> 00:16:27,983
We didn't have a traditional concept pass for our project.

323
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:30,845
So we leaned on the seniority of our production artists

324
00:16:30,946 --> 00:16:33,347
who would need to come together and form consensus

325
00:16:33,407 --> 00:16:35,969
on the best approach for building our very

326
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:36,870
large amount of content.

327
00:16:39,392 --> 00:16:44,454
I'm a character artist by discipline and some of my previous work at VV was to help integrate

328
00:16:44,494 --> 00:16:46,255
Bowser and Crash into the Skylanders games.

329
00:16:48,036 --> 00:16:51,957
Doing this gave me some practical experience trying to meet the goals of a new and different

330
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:55,359
product while being respectful of a brand's heritage.

331
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,541
I personally think it's wise to recognize the meaning iconic franchise characters have

332
00:17:00,822 --> 00:17:02,062
to their audience and to their fans.

333
00:17:03,112 --> 00:17:07,815
My deck will focus on characters, but I hope to reflect the feelings and approach of our

334
00:17:07,995 --> 00:17:09,156
remaster project in general.

335
00:17:09,516 --> 00:17:14,300
And I feel this kind of work kind of begs you to yourself become a fan, which is a point

336
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,220
that I'll be returning to.

337
00:17:17,642 --> 00:17:18,843
So what were our broad goals?

338
00:17:19,723 --> 00:17:22,725
Our game is a from-scratch rebuild of the original three Crash games.

339
00:17:23,426 --> 00:17:28,109
A high-level overview of our approach is we wanted to represent the original games faithfully

340
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,010
while building everything.

341
00:17:30,881 --> 00:17:32,161
from scratch, from the get-go.

342
00:17:33,022 --> 00:17:35,342
Both out of necessity, we didn't have access to everything,

343
00:17:35,903 --> 00:17:37,923
and a desire to achieve a modern presentation.

344
00:17:38,723 --> 00:17:41,504
In the end, we'd hope to kind of freshly reignite

345
00:17:41,524 --> 00:17:43,085
the love fans felt for the original

346
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,866
by giving them something consistent with their memories,

347
00:17:46,606 --> 00:17:48,046
but also that felt visually modern.

348
00:17:50,127 --> 00:17:51,588
For characters, we wanted to bridge the gap

349
00:17:51,608 --> 00:17:55,249
between the classic 32-bit look of the original game

350
00:17:55,789 --> 00:17:57,750
and somewhat of a feature animation-type style.

351
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:01,691
blend the low poly punch of like Naughty Dog's original art

352
00:18:02,452 --> 00:18:05,454
with modern expectations to find a kind of sweet spot

353
00:18:05,514 --> 00:18:06,774
of maximum nostalgia.

354
00:18:07,715 --> 00:18:09,716
Both of these things so as to hopefully not disappoint

355
00:18:09,757 --> 00:18:11,177
anyone playing it totally fresh

356
00:18:12,498 --> 00:18:13,799
or for the first time in two decades.

357
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,641
And this could mean the usual things like

358
00:18:16,881 --> 00:18:19,423
more rounded out volumes, smoother deformations,

359
00:18:19,463 --> 00:18:20,684
more detailed texture presentation.

360
00:18:21,546 --> 00:18:25,891
But importantly, we couldn't sacrifice the essential design language

361
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:28,435
that would be key to triggering those kind of fond feelings

362
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:29,916
we wanted our audience to experience.

363
00:18:34,412 --> 00:18:37,635
There's two particular challenges that we've dealt with that I'd like to kind of focus on.

364
00:18:38,996 --> 00:18:43,820
Finding faithful designs for the rebuilt characters and supporting faithfully dynamic

365
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:48,084
performances for them. Because we were rebuilding these games from scratch, part of the

366
00:18:48,104 --> 00:18:54,749
question becomes, where do we pull our style and inspiration from? This can kind of become a

367
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:59,153
dilemma. It could be easy to go down the path into a full remake or reimagining territory.

368
00:19:00,817 --> 00:19:04,725
where changes that are not carefully executed could lead fans to question the intent of a

369
00:19:04,785 --> 00:19:06,549
product of a game like ours.

370
00:19:07,629 --> 00:19:14,112
Now, as a personal example, I, you know, remember as a kid watching cartoons, I would often

371
00:19:14,172 --> 00:19:18,655
wonder why characters would look off-model from like their 16-bit kind of representations

372
00:19:18,915 --> 00:19:20,276
if I was watching a video game cartoon.

373
00:19:20,856 --> 00:19:24,438
You know, and, you know, that's a harmless effect of graphical limitations at the time.

374
00:19:25,058 --> 00:19:29,000
But the point is, like, that we would want to try to avoid evoking that kind of disconnect

375
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:33,183
with what we were making, that we wanted people to feel comfortable that what they were looking

376
00:19:33,303 --> 00:19:35,464
at is what they remembered and what they cared about.

377
00:19:38,707 --> 00:19:41,988
Because we wanted to flesh out the low poly source art,

378
00:19:42,468 --> 00:19:46,090
we needed to consider where we should pull our character

379
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,130
design influence from.

380
00:19:48,631 --> 00:19:50,892
At first, we flirted with the simple idea

381
00:19:50,912 --> 00:19:52,733
of taking inspiration from original concept art,

382
00:19:53,093 --> 00:19:55,314
from toys, costumes, later era models,

383
00:19:56,054 --> 00:19:58,775
things that were already more fleshed out and detailed

384
00:19:58,935 --> 00:19:59,736
than 32-bit games.

385
00:20:01,656 --> 00:20:03,397
While this would make sense, seem

386
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:05,058
to make sense while targeting a higher fidelity look,

387
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:12,377
they really kind of diverged to a degree.

388
00:20:12,997 --> 00:20:14,999
While the various looks of Crash have commonalities,

389
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:17,621
orange fur, blue shorts, spiky hair,

390
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:20,783
people have particular opinions about which one

391
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:22,004
they might personally want to see.

392
00:20:25,046 --> 00:20:26,888
The Crash band had been relatively dormant

393
00:20:27,648 --> 00:20:29,470
and the art style had changed over the years

394
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,832
and this seemed to kind of cause a sense of confusion

395
00:20:31,872 --> 00:20:33,053
to a degree among the fan base.

396
00:20:34,254 --> 00:20:36,876
And we had to be mindful of what source we were pulling from.

397
00:20:38,263 --> 00:20:42,007
This is a discussion we had to have in regards to every character and all the assets in the

398
00:20:42,047 --> 00:20:42,307
game.

399
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:47,031
Crash is just a kind of a clear good example of the variation that the brand experienced

400
00:20:47,071 --> 00:20:47,532
over the years.

401
00:20:49,894 --> 00:20:55,259
The conclusion is that we eventually came to is that these higher fidelity assets, marketing

402
00:20:55,279 --> 00:21:00,044
materials and stuff, is they lack the simplicity and direct lines of the PlayStation 1 art

403
00:21:00,484 --> 00:21:03,307
that most people were likely to be subconsciously responsive to.

404
00:21:04,661 --> 00:21:08,925
We tried to keep our ear to the ground and observe how people responded to different

405
00:21:08,945 --> 00:21:12,548
game remakes or how they had discussed our previous crash efforts.

406
00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:18,433
Our solution was to kind of preserve the essential angularity of the 32-bit models of the vintage

407
00:21:18,473 --> 00:21:23,938
look, get the character designs right by being faithful to classic looks the majority of

408
00:21:23,978 --> 00:21:29,402
audiences would have nostalgia for without actually creating low-poly art ourselves.

409
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:37,364
When I say essential angularity, I tend to mean the major movements of the shape and silhouette.

410
00:21:38,144 --> 00:21:41,585
So these are the field people respond to on a kind of core level.

411
00:21:41,965 --> 00:21:47,306
So artists needed to not be selfish, had to let go of our previous styles and any desires

412
00:21:47,346 --> 00:21:49,527
to really heavily reinvent these characters.

413
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:55,528
We kind of had to reverse engineer them back to their core, not over-design or fix them.

414
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,169
These characters have a lot of appeal in their own way.

415
00:22:00,263 --> 00:22:03,544
we should polish and not try to lose that kind of core essence.

416
00:22:04,444 --> 00:22:09,846
For Krash himself, this meant keeping that basic triangular shape language that was essential.

417
00:22:11,147 --> 00:22:16,069
You know, preserve it because it's so easy to lose those kind of strong core primitive

418
00:22:16,109 --> 00:22:19,310
shapes when you want to be making art that feels modern and impressive.

419
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,391
This is something we strove to keep in mind.

420
00:22:22,944 --> 00:22:25,405
which isn't to say we were completely literal all the time.

421
00:22:26,226 --> 00:22:28,427
You know, calls had to be made like fitting Crash's eyes

422
00:22:28,467 --> 00:22:29,807
a little bit better into his cranium,

423
00:22:30,428 --> 00:22:32,109
kind of giving him more structural integrity,

424
00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:34,770
kind of more flexibility for animation and consistency.

425
00:22:37,551 --> 00:22:40,133
You can see this approach here applied on entropy as well.

426
00:22:41,173 --> 00:22:42,594
The old model and the new model,

427
00:22:43,134 --> 00:22:46,436
just kind of being mindful of certain shape regions

428
00:22:46,636 --> 00:22:48,517
and the relative relationship they have,

429
00:22:48,637 --> 00:22:51,698
even during pretty noticeable squash and stretch.

430
00:22:54,537 --> 00:22:57,879
So kind of moving on from what worked to when there were complications for us.

431
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,722
We found eventually that individual perception of the retro graphics could cause disagreement.

432
00:23:04,603 --> 00:23:09,026
Definitely among the fan base and even among artists working on a given task.

433
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:12,692
You know, there's only so much fidelity that was visible to most people playing these games

434
00:23:12,732 --> 00:23:15,493
in the first place over composite cables on their CRT TV.

435
00:23:16,654 --> 00:23:20,155
Videos an artist might be referencing might have been captured at a low resolution.

436
00:23:21,136 --> 00:23:24,338
It can lead to a lack of clarity over what some characters' prop pieces were.

437
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:29,680
As a kid, I remember trying to look through my TV screen, trying to get past the color

438
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,082
bleed of the CRT, you know, trying to see the pixels of the characters more clearly.

439
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:40,572
An early unfinished version of this green character right here was shown in one of our

440
00:23:40,612 --> 00:23:41,712
trailers early on.

441
00:23:42,413 --> 00:23:45,635
We were called out in some comments for not getting the colors right or for it to having

442
00:23:45,655 --> 00:23:46,676
a slightly odd look.

443
00:23:47,056 --> 00:23:50,539
The truth was it was an unfinished asset that had slipped out into the wild like sometimes

444
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:51,460
happens unfortunately.

445
00:23:52,961 --> 00:23:55,863
But we were also called out for not realizing what the character was.

446
00:23:56,967 --> 00:23:59,669
Some people saw a lizard character, that was the actual intent.

447
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,191
Others saw some kind of moving plant.

448
00:24:02,551 --> 00:24:06,474
They were discussing what they remember seeing in the original game.

449
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:10,117
The real truth was more complicated.

450
00:24:10,637 --> 00:24:15,300
It was some kind of cyborg lizard with a laser eye, with a molten frill, with bionic parts.

451
00:24:15,981 --> 00:24:19,984
You know, a pretty complex set of characteristics to illustrate in such low fidelity.

452
00:24:20,604 --> 00:24:23,786
Something that's actually a little hard to deconstruct for even a current artist.

453
00:24:25,665 --> 00:24:29,728
You know, it was funny, it was a little silly, but it was an illuminating moment for us.

454
00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:36,112
We established that personal interpretation is a potential challenge for anyone remastering

455
00:24:36,132 --> 00:24:37,553
games like Crash or that vintage.

456
00:24:39,454 --> 00:24:43,937
You know, luckily there was great rejoicing when this one asset seemed to be adequate

457
00:24:44,058 --> 00:24:44,498
at release.

458
00:24:44,518 --> 00:24:49,521
You know, I think posts like this are more kind of in jest about the...

459
00:24:50,565 --> 00:24:54,547
amount of scrutiny that almost every aspect of a game being remastered goes through.

460
00:24:55,107 --> 00:24:59,429
But still the point being, if people care about what you're doing and if you're remastering

461
00:24:59,469 --> 00:25:04,891
something, probably people care about it, you've got to understand that you're going

462
00:25:04,911 --> 00:25:08,093
to be looked at and scrutinized and it's an interesting dialogue back and forth.

463
00:25:11,654 --> 00:25:15,876
So the other big piece for us on the character side was hitting performance consistency with

464
00:25:15,896 --> 00:25:19,878
that kind of zany dynamism that Naughty Dog's original Vertex animations were known for.

465
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:25,365
the level of stretchy smeary deformation that they had was not something that we had been

466
00:25:25,425 --> 00:25:29,008
focused on doing a lot of in our Skylanders work that we were doing before Crash Bandicoot.

467
00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:32,810
A few examples of Crash's expressiveness right here.

468
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,793
It was important to keep in mind things like his large asymmetrical eyes, his kind of like

469
00:25:38,213 --> 00:25:44,017
independently scaling pupils and squared off jaw that can go from extreme closed to ridiculous

470
00:25:44,097 --> 00:25:44,337
open.

471
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:46,718
These were all things that we would have to hit.

472
00:25:48,933 --> 00:25:54,615
And unlike in Sky, we aimed for less detail in our sculpts, to get clean, major forms

473
00:25:54,736 --> 00:25:58,777
only, to support this very stretchy deformable topology.

474
00:25:59,918 --> 00:26:03,400
We used the same character models for our cinematics and for our in-game characters,

475
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,481
and we didn't build any mascot-like expressions in, aiming for like a...

476
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:12,683
pretty true neutral to support more dynamic performance and a wider range of appealing

477
00:26:12,703 --> 00:26:13,163
expressions.

478
00:26:13,563 --> 00:26:16,144
It's the kind of thing that feels risky when you're doing it, when you're used to making

479
00:26:16,184 --> 00:26:21,945
a stylized game, to not build in any character, but it is a more sensible cinematic workflow

480
00:26:22,025 --> 00:26:24,126
and for a greater range of animation.

481
00:26:26,386 --> 00:26:27,746
Here's Crash's flat-shaded model.

482
00:26:28,597 --> 00:26:30,799
with this early expression test by our rigger Jim Donnelly.

483
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,941
Because Crash was known for such expressiveness,

484
00:26:33,981 --> 00:26:35,363
we were anxious to see if everything

485
00:26:35,383 --> 00:26:38,245
would come together in a flat shaded view on our target

486
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:38,746
character.

487
00:26:40,007 --> 00:26:43,630
This was probably day one, like the first pass topology

488
00:26:44,391 --> 00:26:45,451
with the first rig.

489
00:26:45,472 --> 00:26:47,954
And it was kind of a really nice relief

490
00:26:47,974 --> 00:26:50,696
to see that our kind of assumptions and plans

491
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:53,058
were hopefully going to work.

492
00:26:53,098 --> 00:26:54,339
And we were going to find the expressiveness

493
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:54,980
we were looking for.

494
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:58,720
and we still had a lot of time to polish at this point.

495
00:27:00,281 --> 00:27:02,083
So to show you a little bit of how we vetted some of our work,

496
00:27:02,383 --> 00:27:06,465
here is a gag test by cinematic animator Eric Johnson,

497
00:27:07,426 --> 00:27:11,689
seeing if we could hit this kind of classy zany animated feel

498
00:27:11,729 --> 00:27:12,109
as well.

499
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,351
I'd love to play it for you again,

500
00:27:14,651 --> 00:27:16,932
but I don't think it's going to roll.

501
00:27:17,993 --> 00:27:20,375
Just to, oh, let me try.

502
00:27:24,898 --> 00:27:25,318
Oh, OK.

503
00:27:25,358 --> 00:27:26,178
I'm going to move on.

504
00:27:28,003 --> 00:27:32,186
The thing being that what we needed was a lot of flexibility, a lot of bendiness.

505
00:27:33,648 --> 00:27:37,972
We had to kind of like internalize kind of the classic like kind of sense like that topology

506
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:40,053
should be even and nicely distributed.

507
00:27:40,394 --> 00:27:43,757
We had to like really keep this in mind with the characters we were using because of the

508
00:27:43,797 --> 00:27:44,938
amount of stretchiness we wanted.

509
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,112
and the amount of influences pervert.

510
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:51,999
Also, it played really well with the fur shader we were using.

511
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,445
Having this nice kind of consistent ring mesh type topology

512
00:27:56,006 --> 00:28:00,213
allowed the fur shells to kind of stretch uniformly and not look too distorted.

513
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:09,367
To get Crash's eyes to work, his eyeball topology needed to be stitched directly into his eyelids

514
00:28:09,407 --> 00:28:10,528
for one contiguous mesh.

515
00:28:11,628 --> 00:28:16,210
He still had a bit of a sphere under there, but the lids could open beyond their widest

516
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:20,751
extents and begin to stretch, which is kind of like a mix of an old school kind of painted

517
00:28:20,851 --> 00:28:21,951
on eye and a normal eyeball.

518
00:28:21,971 --> 00:28:25,913
The pupils then would slide around on the surface in a very cartoony manner and could

519
00:28:25,953 --> 00:28:26,593
be scaled independently.

520
00:28:26,613 --> 00:28:28,613

521
00:28:28,633 --> 00:28:28,813
Thank you.

522
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:29,314
Have a great day.

523
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:29,394
Bye.

524
00:28:29,414 --> 00:28:29,494
Bye.

525
00:28:29,514 --> 00:28:29,574
Bye.

526
00:28:29,594 --> 00:28:29,654
Bye.

527
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:29,734
Bye.

528
00:28:29,774 --> 00:28:29,834
Bye.

529
00:28:29,854 --> 00:28:29,914
Bye.

530
00:28:29,934 --> 00:28:30,014
Bye.

531
00:28:30,034 --> 00:28:30,094
Bye.

532
00:28:30,114 --> 00:28:30,174
Bye.

533
00:28:30,234 --> 00:28:30,294
Bye.

534
00:28:30,314 --> 00:28:30,374
Bye.

535
00:28:30,394 --> 00:28:30,474
Bye.

536
00:28:30,494 --> 00:28:30,554
Bye.

537
00:28:30,614 --> 00:28:30,674
Bye.

538
00:28:30,694 --> 00:28:30,754
Bye.

539
00:28:30,774 --> 00:28:30,834
Bye.

540
00:28:30,854 --> 00:28:30,914
Bye.

541
00:28:34,271 --> 00:28:37,772
Since we weren't completely liberal to the original geometry, ideally we'd have an even

542
00:28:37,812 --> 00:28:43,334
greater expressive range, getting full wacky and hopefully with the ability to control

543
00:28:43,394 --> 00:28:46,696
for more nuance and subtlety on the occasions it was called for.

544
00:28:50,957 --> 00:28:54,699
In the end the player was meant to go, this looks good, that's the reaction we wanted.

545
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:59,781
Our art should not have been overly distracting to the average player for its stylistic choices

546
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:00,861
in comparison to the original.

547
00:29:02,415 --> 00:29:06,556
We didn't want to be overly burdened by hardcore fan reaction, however it could really be an

548
00:29:06,576 --> 00:29:09,297
interesting gauge for us to see if our art choices blended in.

549
00:29:10,297 --> 00:29:13,838
Or if we were distracting and breaking our, this is how I remember it, goal.

550
00:29:14,118 --> 00:29:19,260
We wanted to give a little bit more than a straight remaster report, but we didn't want

551
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,000
to go too far and kind of break everyone's immersion.

552
00:29:23,641 --> 00:29:25,181
We learned some good lessons from the path we chose.

553
00:29:26,847 --> 00:29:28,448
We were very happy with the fan reaction.

554
00:29:28,488 --> 00:29:29,908
We, hopefully, people enjoyed it.

555
00:29:31,329 --> 00:29:33,189
We think it was very wise to be aware

556
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:35,870
of how the Crash Bandicoot brand was being perceived

557
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,411
at the time we were working on our project

558
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:38,871
and how it was being scrutinized.

559
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:42,472
And especially important to not be above our source material,

560
00:29:43,413 --> 00:29:45,733
to look to embellish and not replace what was there,

561
00:29:46,154 --> 00:29:48,334
but to keep clear, and to keep clear targets

562
00:29:48,374 --> 00:29:49,235
on how to achieve that.

563
00:29:50,095 --> 00:29:51,515
I think people love these franchises,

564
00:29:52,216 --> 00:29:53,916
enough so that they're out there producing their own art

565
00:29:53,976 --> 00:29:55,156
and keeping the torch burning.

566
00:29:56,032 --> 00:29:58,114
Uh, even when the series is dormant for long stretches of time.

567
00:29:58,775 --> 00:30:02,377
I believe it pays to be respectful and to recognize, like, that love if you're doing

568
00:30:02,397 --> 00:30:02,978
this type of work.

569
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,921
And that's it for me.

570
00:30:06,941 --> 00:30:09,603
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

571
00:30:09,943 --> 00:30:13,506
If you'd like to talk about anything covered today, or the merits of playing retro games

572
00:30:13,546 --> 00:30:16,028
on CRTs versus upscalers, I'd love to talk about that.

573
00:30:16,869 --> 00:30:19,411
Um, up next is, uh, Eugene from Shiny Shoe.

574
00:30:26,953 --> 00:30:30,234
Hi everyone, I'm Eugen Kim, co-founder and art director of Shiny Shoe,

575
00:30:30,554 --> 00:30:33,335
an indie studio located here in San Francisco.

576
00:30:33,836 --> 00:30:36,337
Shiny Shoe makes original titles and also partners

577
00:30:36,357 --> 00:30:37,777
with other studios on their titles.

578
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:40,178
We teamed up with our friends at Double Fine

579
00:30:40,198 --> 00:30:43,680
to remaster the classic LucasArts point and click adventure games,

580
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,581
Grim Fandango, Day of the Tentacle, and Full Throttle.

581
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:52,896
Today I'm going to focus on our actual production experience on full throttle remastered. In

582
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:57,981
relation to some assumptions about remastering the visuals of a game, assumptions I myself

583
00:30:58,021 --> 00:31:02,485
have made in the past or heard during planning or budgeting meetings or heard from consumers.

584
00:31:06,449 --> 00:31:11,233
Specifically, one, remastering is just a reskin. It just needs a fresh coat of paint.

585
00:31:12,035 --> 00:31:16,777
Two, we have better tools now. It should be easier to build assets. It will take less

586
00:31:16,837 --> 00:31:21,899
effort and things will go more quickly. Three, we have assets from the original so we can

587
00:31:21,939 --> 00:31:27,341
reuse stuff or leverage existing assets. It's been my experience that these are false

588
00:31:27,381 --> 00:31:32,763
assumptions that can put you and the production team in a tight spot. Fortunately, the full

589
00:31:32,783 --> 00:31:34,243
throttle team was an experienced group.

590
00:31:35,263 --> 00:31:37,265
And while we did not make such assumptions outright,

591
00:31:37,705 --> 00:31:39,627
we still faced a lot of production challenges

592
00:31:39,927 --> 00:31:41,388
that would have proved self-destructive

593
00:31:41,768 --> 00:31:43,010
had we made such assumptions.

594
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,513
Many resources were invested into reviving Full Throttle,

595
00:31:46,853 --> 00:31:49,335
which I hope gives you food for thought for your projects,

596
00:31:50,436 --> 00:31:52,618
be it a remaster or even an original title.

597
00:31:55,381 --> 00:31:58,464
When Shiny Shoe first partnered with Double Fine to remaster Grim Fandango,

598
00:31:58,564 --> 00:32:02,567
Day of the Tentacle, and Full Throttle, a core philosophy that Tim and Double Fine

599
00:32:02,647 --> 00:32:06,010
consistently emphasized was to remain true to the original experience.

600
00:32:06,831 --> 00:32:08,632
We want to keep true to the original work of art.

601
00:32:09,013 --> 00:32:12,055
It's a collaboration of a bunch of artists coming together, the acting,

602
00:32:12,135 --> 00:32:15,258
the writing, the sound design, the music, and animation.

603
00:32:15,858 --> 00:32:18,981
All these people work together to make this thing,

604
00:32:19,281 --> 00:32:20,242
and we don't want to mess with it.

605
00:32:20,859 --> 00:32:25,223
We just want to present it in the best possible way and make it more true to the original

606
00:32:25,263 --> 00:32:30,389
intentions. We're getting rid of artifacts, compression and aging technology to make it

607
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:38,036
look like it looks in our minds. A key decision in adhering to this core philosophy was to port the

608
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:42,761
original game engine to current platforms, or to paraphrase our programmer Trevor Deem.

609
00:32:43,725 --> 00:32:45,145
While the game is running for the user,

610
00:32:45,466 --> 00:32:48,407
query the game state each frame and retrieve enough data

611
00:32:48,447 --> 00:32:51,089
about the game state so we can then provide the user

612
00:32:51,129 --> 00:32:52,669
with a more modern presentation.

613
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:54,790
So as far as the game is concerned,

614
00:32:55,031 --> 00:32:57,092
it's still ticking along like it had back in 1995.

615
00:32:58,873 --> 00:33:01,214
This meant that we had to author the remastered assets

616
00:33:01,434 --> 00:33:03,995
in a similar way that the original artist did back

617
00:33:04,075 --> 00:33:06,997
in 1995, but of course, with modern tools.

618
00:33:08,417 --> 00:33:08,918
No problem.

619
00:33:09,258 --> 00:33:11,119
That's just a reskin, a fresh coat of paint.

620
00:33:11,797 --> 00:33:13,738
Like painting over 20 year old paint on a house.

621
00:33:14,178 --> 00:33:14,959
Sure, it's easy.

622
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:17,220
Plus we have modern spray guns and stuff, right?

623
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:18,980
Excuse me.

624
00:33:19,421 --> 00:33:21,882
I'm confident that any professional house painter

625
00:33:21,922 --> 00:33:23,282
will tell you it's not that simple.

626
00:33:23,723 --> 00:33:26,464
Preparation is required before a single can of paint is open.

627
00:33:27,084 --> 00:33:30,005
There's tons of scraping, spackling, sanding, masking.

628
00:33:30,746 --> 00:33:32,446
There's a process and a pipeline required

629
00:33:32,486 --> 00:33:35,028
to do the job properly so that it holds up over time

630
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:36,808
so that your customer is satisfied.

631
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:44,479
The original Full Throttle paint was beautiful, a blend of 2D and 3D assets and animations.

632
00:33:44,819 --> 00:33:49,121
It was unique for its time, but it was of its time, and now it's 22 years old.

633
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:52,842
The game's original resolution was 320 by 200 pixels.

634
00:33:53,242 --> 00:33:57,984
The remaster had to support 4K resolution, well over 10 times the original resolution.

635
00:33:58,664 --> 00:34:02,606
In other words, that 10 by 10 foot wall that needed a fresh coat of paint is suddenly 100

636
00:34:02,986 --> 00:34:06,307
by 100 feet, 100 times the scraping, spackling, and sanding.

637
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:10,611
We have better tools now.

638
00:34:10,931 --> 00:34:12,311
It should be easier to build assets.

639
00:34:12,731 --> 00:34:14,772
Things will go much quicker than it did for the original.

640
00:34:16,933 --> 00:34:18,774
It's my understanding that the original Full Throttle

641
00:34:18,814 --> 00:34:21,815
development team used Deepaint, proprietary animation,

642
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:24,916
and editing tools, and 3D Studio released two or three

643
00:34:24,976 --> 00:34:25,637
for production.

644
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:28,918
I'm not sure how many here are old enough to remember Deepaint

645
00:34:29,018 --> 00:34:32,159
or 3D Studio before it was maximized, but just for kicks,

646
00:34:32,539 --> 00:34:33,160
they look like this.

647
00:34:34,316 --> 00:34:35,516
limited colors in deep paint,

648
00:34:36,056 --> 00:34:37,797
and no character rigging in 3D Studio.

649
00:34:38,257 --> 00:34:39,417
And if I recall correctly,

650
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:41,538
UV mapping meant rotating the camera

651
00:34:41,578 --> 00:34:42,718
so that it faced the polygon

652
00:34:43,038 --> 00:34:45,419
and taking a screenshot or using graph paper.

653
00:34:46,339 --> 00:34:48,420
Clearly, they were limited tools by today's standard,

654
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,880
but powerful at the time and the best available.

655
00:34:51,401 --> 00:34:53,661
A nice big paint bucket and durable brush

656
00:34:54,381 --> 00:34:55,922
to paint that 10 by 10 foot wall.

657
00:34:57,962 --> 00:34:58,983
And paint that wall they did,

658
00:34:59,643 --> 00:35:02,163
creating Full Throttle's unique visual style and universe.

659
00:35:03,025 --> 00:35:06,288
For the remaster, Photoshop, Flash, Premiere, and Maya

660
00:35:06,328 --> 00:35:07,389
were our modern spray guns.

661
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:10,192
But remember that 100 square foot wall

662
00:35:10,392 --> 00:35:11,874
is now 10,000 square feet.

663
00:35:12,614 --> 00:35:15,157
Aside from the pure physical scale that needed to be reworked,

664
00:35:15,597 --> 00:35:17,199
the upgrades created content issues.

665
00:35:21,363 --> 00:35:23,946
Things that could be alluded to or suggested in the original

666
00:35:24,106 --> 00:35:26,729
were obviously incomplete or awkwardly amorphous at 4K.

667
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:31,215
Furthermore, the now standard 16 by 9 aspect ratio

668
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:34,316
created dead space around the original 4, 3 aspect ratio.

669
00:35:35,116 --> 00:35:36,817
Rather than pillar or letterbox the image,

670
00:35:37,357 --> 00:35:39,038
we extended the scenes with new content,

671
00:35:39,678 --> 00:35:42,159
which in turn created new issues for visual composition,

672
00:35:42,799 --> 00:35:44,199
animations that cross the screen,

673
00:35:44,799 --> 00:35:46,680
or gameplay that relied on the original boundaries

674
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,520
of the visual plane.

675
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,961
This created new design discussions and feedback loops

676
00:35:51,301 --> 00:35:53,902
to devise new guidelines to preserve the original intent

677
00:35:53,942 --> 00:35:55,963
of the visuals while adding new content.

678
00:36:01,632 --> 00:36:04,113
We're all aware that modern spray guns have shortcomings of their own.

679
00:36:04,993 --> 00:36:08,915
Custom pipelines often push tools to perform in ways that they were not designed for.

680
00:36:09,615 --> 00:36:14,237
For example, Full Throttle's animation engine, briefly described here by Oliver Franske,

681
00:36:14,717 --> 00:36:15,877
put Flash in a bad way.

682
00:36:17,598 --> 00:36:21,900
We stuck with Flash because it suited the character art style, animators are familiar

683
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,042
with it, and we had existing tools and pipelines from the remaster of Day of the Tentacle.

684
00:36:26,697 --> 00:36:29,199
But further into production, the difference in the animation

685
00:36:29,259 --> 00:36:32,321
engine from Day of the Tentacle amplified minor pre-existing

686
00:36:32,361 --> 00:36:33,282
problems in authoring.

687
00:36:34,042 --> 00:36:37,024
Alignment between animation components and animation slots

688
00:36:37,084 --> 00:36:37,965
became problematic.

689
00:36:38,565 --> 00:36:40,146
And Flash really pooped its pants

690
00:36:40,206 --> 00:36:42,148
when high-res pre-rendered 3D frames

691
00:36:42,328 --> 00:36:43,368
needed to be incorporated.

692
00:36:44,209 --> 00:36:46,731
Granted, by introducing high-resolution raster images,

693
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:49,593
we pushed Flash in a way that it wasn't meant to be pushed.

694
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,801
But we were too far into production

695
00:36:51,921 --> 00:36:53,362
to make changes in authoring tools.

696
00:36:53,882 --> 00:36:55,642
Instead, more resources had to be put

697
00:36:55,682 --> 00:36:58,283
into existing animation pipelines to shore it up.

698
00:37:00,604 --> 00:37:02,165
For cut scenes, we went with Premiere,

699
00:37:02,545 --> 00:37:04,046
primarily because we're familiar with it,

700
00:37:04,566 --> 00:37:07,887
but automating Premiere for cut scene rendering

701
00:37:08,127 --> 00:37:10,448
proved to be challenging in the time frame that we had.

702
00:37:11,433 --> 00:37:16,377
Thus, since every tweak, bug, or polish pass required a cutscene to be reprocessed

703
00:37:16,557 --> 00:37:20,940
through a fairly complex export cycle, we ultimately poured a lot of resources into

704
00:37:21,361 --> 00:37:28,386
managing and maintaining that pipeline. So while new tools are more powerful, you're

705
00:37:28,426 --> 00:37:32,129
not using them in the same context as the original, which seems to be the root of the

706
00:37:32,169 --> 00:37:36,893
misconception. People assume we're making similar assets to the original, but with new,

707
00:37:36,953 --> 00:37:40,996
more powerful tools. But new pipelines carry as much overhead as they ever did.

708
00:37:41,497 --> 00:37:43,457
and new specifications and expectations

709
00:37:43,618 --> 00:37:45,398
keep pace or outpace the tools.

710
00:37:45,859 --> 00:37:47,499
So in many ways, you are in the same boat

711
00:37:47,759 --> 00:37:48,560
as the original team.

712
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,801
We have advantages over a full development cycle

713
00:37:51,841 --> 00:37:53,962
because game mechanics, concepts, and designs

714
00:37:54,382 --> 00:37:55,263
may remain the same,

715
00:37:55,863 --> 00:37:58,144
but a remaster involves a brand new production cycle

716
00:37:58,204 --> 00:38:00,425
that is rife with production challenges of its own.

717
00:38:02,926 --> 00:38:04,207
But we have assets from the original,

718
00:38:04,547 --> 00:38:06,988
so maybe we can reuse stuff or leverage existing assets.

719
00:38:08,602 --> 00:38:12,930
There might be an argument for this if the original game is within a generation or so

720
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:13,892
of current technology.

721
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:18,661
For Full Throttle, however, the 22-year-old game's archives were the cardboard file box

722
00:38:18,741 --> 00:38:19,883
of CD-ROMs and binders.

723
00:38:22,254 --> 00:38:27,258
The CD-ROMs of the source art contain scans of Peter Chan's original concepts and incremental

724
00:38:27,398 --> 00:38:30,521
and redundant copies of individual artists' hard drives from 1995.

725
00:38:31,762 --> 00:38:36,266
Within those hard drive backups were file folders of incremental source and intermediate

726
00:38:36,526 --> 00:38:37,527
3D and 2D files.

727
00:38:38,167 --> 00:38:41,851
Basically there was no master source control project that we could use and there was no

728
00:38:41,891 --> 00:38:46,014
tracking documentation that we could find, so we had to sift through all the data and

729
00:38:46,054 --> 00:38:49,517
create tracking spreadsheets just to figure out what and where everything was.

730
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,641
In terms of 2D assets, aside from the scans

731
00:38:54,681 --> 00:38:56,742
of Peter's original concepts, which were really cool,

732
00:38:57,362 --> 00:38:59,563
we found no higher res authoring source files.

733
00:38:59,983 --> 00:39:01,683
Instead, Oliver extracted frames

734
00:39:01,723 --> 00:39:03,904
from the shipped source code

735
00:39:04,144 --> 00:39:06,345
to create authoring files in Photoshop and Flash.

736
00:39:06,865 --> 00:39:08,766
And artists and animators worked from low res

737
00:39:08,886 --> 00:39:11,426
referenced images scaled up to 4K resolution.

738
00:39:11,446 --> 00:39:13,867
There's a lot of room for misinterpretation

739
00:39:13,907 --> 00:39:15,488
with that much resolution difference.

740
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:23,935
On the 3D front, we had source files, but since there was no source control, we could

741
00:39:23,975 --> 00:39:27,596
not determine which files were actually used to render the game's final assets.

742
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:32,137
Going by latest date was pointless, because there was no guarantee that the file was actually

743
00:39:32,277 --> 00:39:33,277
used in the final product.

744
00:39:34,117 --> 00:39:38,518
Trevor ended up creating a special tool just to isolate the best or closest 3D animation

745
00:39:39,799 --> 00:39:40,719
file used in the game.

746
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:43,539
It was a viewing and sorting tool that played thumbnail

747
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:47,501
previews rendered out from each source 3D file, as well as the

748
00:39:47,541 --> 00:39:50,723
original intermediate output frames from 2D files alongside

749
00:39:50,743 --> 00:39:53,785
the final footage of the original game. We filtered by

750
00:39:53,845 --> 00:39:56,206
file format and frame count ranges and cherry picked the

751
00:39:56,246 --> 00:39:59,608
files that looked correct. It was a fantastic tool, but we

752
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:02,530
still spent weeks distilling the archives down to the files

753
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:07,492
needed for remastering. Check out Trevor's blog on Yamasutra

754
00:40:07,532 --> 00:40:09,153
detailing the process and tools involved.

755
00:40:11,178 --> 00:40:13,519
After we isolated Full Throttle's source 3D files,

756
00:40:13,899 --> 00:40:15,520
custom scripts and tools were created

757
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,300
to import the relevant original data,

758
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:19,581
mostly cameras and key frames, into Maya,

759
00:40:19,982 --> 00:40:21,922
set up the render globals to remaster specs,

760
00:40:22,523 --> 00:40:25,444
and allowed artists to quickly reference in remastered models

761
00:40:25,624 --> 00:40:27,865
over the original and set them up for the render farm.

762
00:40:29,366 --> 00:40:31,626
The full remastering and re-rendering of 3D files

763
00:40:31,667 --> 00:40:32,787
were only part of the process.

764
00:40:33,407 --> 00:40:34,928
We were unable to find about one third

765
00:40:34,948 --> 00:40:36,148
of the 3D source assets,

766
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:38,129
so we resorted to rotoscoping in Maya

767
00:40:38,289 --> 00:40:40,210
using the original cutscene frames as reference.

768
00:40:41,002 --> 00:40:43,184
After that, we still had to composite the 2D assets

769
00:40:43,384 --> 00:40:44,605
with the rendered 3D assets

770
00:40:44,925 --> 00:40:46,787
into cinematics and in-game cutscenes.

771
00:40:47,447 --> 00:40:48,528
Masking and match moving,

772
00:40:48,668 --> 00:40:50,330
as well as the logistics of tracking

773
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,391
and timing file dependencies,

774
00:40:52,712 --> 00:40:54,193
was extremely time-consuming.

775
00:40:56,695 --> 00:41:00,077
Once again, a hope or an assumption of production gains

776
00:41:00,138 --> 00:41:01,899
is negated by new production overhead.

777
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,081
Thus, in estimating art production for a remaster,

778
00:41:05,302 --> 00:41:07,363
consider that even if the core game mechanics

779
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,684
and design remain the same,

780
00:41:09,272 --> 00:41:14,276
The production aspects are always a new undertaking and will pose as many challenges as the original title.

781
00:41:15,157 --> 00:41:28,868
The original core art production team on Full Throttle apparently comprised of two painters, five animators, three 3D modelers, and an additional four animators and five artists in support, working over a 20 to 24 month period.

782
00:41:29,409 --> 00:41:32,651
By comparison, Full Throttle Remastered involved approximately 14 painters.

783
00:41:33,687 --> 00:41:36,549
about a dozen 2D animators, three 3D animators,

784
00:41:36,689 --> 00:41:38,330
and three modelers ramping in and out

785
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,570
over roughly 12 months.

786
00:41:40,671 --> 00:41:43,272
There were over 15,000 unique hand-animated frames,

787
00:41:43,672 --> 00:41:45,393
nearly 200 remastered backgrounds,

788
00:41:46,013 --> 00:41:50,496
and 445 individual FMV cuts that made up 134 FMVs.

789
00:41:52,697 --> 00:41:55,098
My special thanks to Double Fine, the Double Fine artists,

790
00:41:55,398 --> 00:41:56,899
and our production partners at Yotta,

791
00:41:57,019 --> 00:41:58,340
Super Genius, and Lockshow.

792
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,041
I'll close with a few general thoughts.

793
00:42:01,801 --> 00:42:05,406
I'm of the opinion that game development, like nature, abhors a vacuum.

794
00:42:06,247 --> 00:42:09,612
Production overhead and expectations always rush in to fill that vacuum.

795
00:42:10,553 --> 00:42:14,038
Or another way to look at it is that the game is never done, it's just taken away.

796
00:42:14,058 --> 00:42:17,142
Unless it's a mobile game, then it's just never done.

797
00:42:17,923 --> 00:42:18,244
Thank you.

798
00:42:26,633 --> 00:42:32,281
So that's it for us, but if you guys have any questions, we'd love to answer them, so

799
00:42:32,521 --> 00:42:33,743
We'll open it up to you guys

800
00:42:34,524 --> 00:42:39,932
Do these mics work? Oh, yeah, they do. Everybody's mics work. Your mics work. I think there's one here. There's one there

801
00:42:41,454 --> 00:42:42,094
Any questions?

802
00:42:45,337 --> 00:42:46,799
Yeah, I'm Jeff from Clay.

803
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:51,384
So for the StarCraft not redoing the cinematics,

804
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:53,566
was that just a production issue?

805
00:42:53,766 --> 00:42:56,169
Or was that because they wanted the core cinematics

806
00:42:56,229 --> 00:42:57,190
to stay the same?

807
00:42:57,915 --> 00:42:58,956
It was a little bit of both.

808
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:03,799
Initially when we reached out, I think because of the people

809
00:43:03,819 --> 00:43:05,661
that we talked to were mostly professionals,

810
00:43:06,642 --> 00:43:08,083
the people that are continuously playing,

811
00:43:08,603 --> 00:43:10,605
they're not playing the single player campaigns

812
00:43:10,805 --> 00:43:12,206
and so it wasn't important to them.

813
00:43:12,466 --> 00:43:14,768
And so we kind of, like that was the feedback we got.

814
00:43:14,788 --> 00:43:16,369
We're like, well, they're not really important.

815
00:43:16,769 --> 00:43:17,830
Nobody watches them anyway.

816
00:43:18,945 --> 00:43:24,610
So initially that was kind of our thing, but then once we started getting into it and we started showing what we've done with the multiplayer,

817
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:28,833
they're like, are you guys redoing the cinematics? And I was like, yes, let's do that.

818
00:43:29,014 --> 00:43:38,282
And by that time we were kind of six months in and it was just, we would have to, if somebody come in and actually rewrite everything, we'd have to go through lore.

819
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:45,348
There's a lot of roadblocks on it and eventually we decided it's just too much for our time that we wanted to do it.

820
00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:57,818
Hi. I guess this kind of applies to all three, but what was QA like? Did you guys have like

821
00:43:57,939 --> 00:44:02,863
aesthetic nostalgia QA for like checking in whether or not you were heading home and the

822
00:44:02,903 --> 00:44:06,907
original characters feels or just the environments feel, everything like that?

823
00:44:07,405 --> 00:44:13,469
We, speaking at least to our project, QA was absolutely headed up by an enormous fan.

824
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:19,293
So key QA people on the project were people who were very big fans of the franchise

825
00:44:19,794 --> 00:44:22,716
and the expectation was to be checking it against the original game

826
00:44:22,756 --> 00:44:25,238
and being mindful of things like that, absolutely.

827
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:30,482
So for us we actually had an embedded QA team.

828
00:44:31,462 --> 00:44:33,063
Nobody from back when.

829
00:44:33,564 --> 00:44:36,687
But one of the things we had incorporated was an F5 key

830
00:44:37,147 --> 00:44:39,729
for testing, so that we could switch back and forth.

831
00:44:39,909 --> 00:44:42,411
Because to us, it was really important that nothing really

832
00:44:42,491 --> 00:44:43,892
jumps out as different.

833
00:44:44,373 --> 00:44:47,055
And so one of the main things we tested was, you know what?

834
00:44:47,095 --> 00:44:49,537
While you're playing, push F5, play it in standard

835
00:44:49,557 --> 00:44:50,958
definition, go back to HD.

836
00:44:51,458 --> 00:44:53,119
If something pops out, then it's wrong,

837
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:53,960
and we had to redo it.

838
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:57,983
And this isn't even with gameplay, but one of the

839
00:44:58,003 --> 00:45:02,747
things we had is we had a ProDos portrait, and his eyes

840
00:45:02,827 --> 00:45:03,007
were

841
00:45:03,872 --> 00:45:08,022
supposed to be blue and I think we changed them to red because in StarCraft II his eyes were red.

842
00:45:09,548 --> 00:45:14,529
immediately, like in a focus group, I was like, how do you even know what the protoss eyes colors is?

843
00:45:14,589 --> 00:45:19,651
But they're like, hey, it's supposed to be blue. And so we actually re-rendered it all and put that in there because

844
00:45:20,271 --> 00:45:22,532
it's one of those things. If somebody notices it, then

845
00:45:23,332 --> 00:45:27,694
we did it wrong. So that was the main focus, was not to do anything that people noticed.

846
00:45:30,815 --> 00:45:33,876
Could you make the most subtle art in the world, but also make it impactful.

847
00:45:35,196 --> 00:45:35,876
Well, thank you.

848
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:36,997
Welcome.

849
00:45:39,204 --> 00:45:40,565
More of a question for Crash.

850
00:45:41,706 --> 00:45:48,873
There was a lot of speedruns on the original game, and that means the speedrunners were

851
00:45:48,953 --> 00:45:50,835
using a lot of glitches or exploit.

852
00:45:51,776 --> 00:45:55,400
Has there been analysis to reproduce them in the remaster?

853
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,624
You're asking was there intention to reproduce them, or were they reproduced?

854
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:05,305
Yeah, exactly, I mean, if a speedrunner, uh, get on the remaster and try a DX port to get

855
00:46:05,605 --> 00:46:10,552
the same speedruns, uh, has there been analysis on that in pre-production?

856
00:46:11,253 --> 00:46:15,779
So I can't speak too much to stuff like that because it, it hews more on the design end

857
00:46:15,819 --> 00:46:16,299
of the spectrum.

858
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:23,083
But I do know that we had players who were doing like internal speedruns and time trials and testing things like that

859
00:46:23,443 --> 00:46:26,925
I can't say whether we kept bugs in nor intentionally remove them

860
00:46:27,245 --> 00:46:31,688
We kind of did a mixture of polishing features and keeping features

861
00:46:32,648 --> 00:46:36,210
So sorry, I can't give you a really clean answer, but hopefully that's a little bit

862
00:46:37,191 --> 00:46:37,671
Awesome, thank you

863
00:46:42,787 --> 00:46:45,107
Hey guys, this is for Corey.

864
00:46:45,867 --> 00:46:47,368
First of all, when I played it,

865
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:49,288
I felt like I was eight years old again,

866
00:46:49,368 --> 00:46:51,469
so you definitely, you definitely did.

867
00:46:51,509 --> 00:46:51,969
Woo, all right.

868
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:53,329
That's good.

869
00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:54,469
I was actually just curious,

870
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:57,110
did you guys, how did you guys render the fur

871
00:46:57,490 --> 00:46:58,751
on all the characters?

872
00:46:58,871 --> 00:46:59,431
Sure, yeah.

873
00:46:59,811 --> 00:47:02,351
So it was a kind of a procedural shell solution

874
00:47:02,591 --> 00:47:03,772
that was made in-house.

875
00:47:04,312 --> 00:47:05,632
Originally it was part of my deck,

876
00:47:05,672 --> 00:47:07,473
but for time we can't cover like everything.

877
00:47:08,333 --> 00:47:14,202
So the fur used kind of detail maps to kind of push out shells,

878
00:47:14,302 --> 00:47:17,687
like almost like traditionally, like from the mesh.

879
00:47:18,047 --> 00:47:21,773
And we'd use varying height maps to kind of get different amounts of kind of like

880
00:47:22,353 --> 00:47:24,256
variation in the height along the fur.

881
00:47:24,917 --> 00:47:29,339
uh we could scale the grain, we could push the height, basically

882
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:33,142
we had a suite of sliders. Uh we also had um a normal brushing

883
00:47:33,182 --> 00:47:36,924
solution for doing the directionality of the fur. So we

884
00:47:36,944 --> 00:47:40,386
would create additional vertex normals and brush those and that

885
00:47:40,406 --> 00:47:43,288
would give us our direction um on top of the shells that were

886
00:47:43,328 --> 00:47:46,650
just being pushed out from the fur. Um we had an anisotropic

887
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:50,672
feature on it as well and the direction of the aniso would go

888
00:47:50,772 --> 00:47:52,953
with the brush to direction of the normals too.

889
00:47:54,054 --> 00:47:57,536
Um, yeah, it was, maybe at some point somebody will show that too.

890
00:47:58,216 --> 00:47:58,797
Awesome, thanks.

891
00:47:58,817 --> 00:47:59,497
Yeah, you're welcome.

892
00:48:08,003 --> 00:48:14,087
Hi, I'm Lizzie from Pixel Lakes and GameSmart and I was just wondering if you guys anticipate

893
00:48:14,127 --> 00:48:17,189
remastering any of your games in the future, again.

894
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:19,470
Is that for everybody?

895
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:20,111
Everyone, yeah.

896
00:48:20,251 --> 00:48:20,331
Yep.

897
00:48:22,146 --> 00:48:27,573
So as the Classic Games team, we're basically taking each game as a case-by-case basis.

898
00:48:28,374 --> 00:48:32,300
Obviously StarCraft is one because it's such an old game and it had never been incorporated

899
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:36,004
into Battle.net and we saw it as an opportunity to do that.

900
00:48:36,825 --> 00:48:39,068
But in general, the Classic Games team is just...

901
00:48:40,179 --> 00:48:41,540
supporting all of our older games.

902
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,322
If we're going to remaster any of it, that's kind of like up in the future,

903
00:48:44,342 --> 00:48:47,604
like does it require it, you know, do people still play it?

904
00:48:48,685 --> 00:48:52,328
In general, we just want to make sure that all of our games are playable

905
00:48:52,948 --> 00:48:54,850
and, you know, the best experience that people can get.

906
00:48:56,111 --> 00:48:58,913
But not every game necessarily needs a remaster.

907
00:48:59,053 --> 00:48:59,313
Right.

908
00:48:59,914 --> 00:49:00,454
Right, right, right.

909
00:49:01,053 --> 00:49:07,699
Yeah, I think from like Activision's perspective, just seeing the reception that Crash has received,

910
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:11,603
you know, opens doors to considering more projects like that.

911
00:49:12,284 --> 00:49:17,569
You know, I can't say specifically whether like any are happening or what the future might be,

912
00:49:18,049 --> 00:49:22,994
but definitely when these projects like go over well, it makes people pay more attention.

913
00:49:23,882 --> 00:49:27,745
Sure. And a lot of you had mentioned that you lost assets over time.

914
00:49:28,845 --> 00:49:33,209
Are you guys taking more precaution into saving them for whatever?

915
00:49:33,229 --> 00:49:36,691
So that's another thing that we're kind of tasked with,

916
00:49:37,272 --> 00:49:40,194
especially across Blizzard, because now we have so many projects

917
00:49:40,734 --> 00:49:43,757
is getting that resources.

918
00:49:43,797 --> 00:49:48,240
We actually set up a vault that will incorporate all of the work

919
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:51,903
that we've done into like this one central location so that it's not lost again.

920
00:49:52,743 --> 00:49:56,868
Starcraft, I think, is one of the games that we've lost almost everything on,

921
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:02,454
but we're still working through all of the old assets.

922
00:50:03,475 --> 00:50:07,860
Activision, the same thing. These days we archive everything at the end of every project,

923
00:50:07,941 --> 00:50:10,824
but I think all three of us basically encountered the issue that...

924
00:50:12,984 --> 00:50:17,669
nobody had the original stuff we didn't have access to. At least most of it. For the most part

925
00:50:17,789 --> 00:50:22,634
anything we looked at was extracted from the release builds of the game. But now we're much

926
00:50:22,674 --> 00:50:33,705
more diligent about source control. Yeah. Thank you. Any other questions? I'd love to chat.

927
00:50:35,215 --> 00:50:40,601
All right. If you guys want to do any personal questions, you don't want to talk, there's a

928
00:50:40,781 --> 00:50:45,325
room across the way for, over there.

929
00:50:45,845 --> 00:50:46,406
Outside of here.

930
00:50:46,486 --> 00:50:47,147
Outside of the room.

931
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:48,428
If you feel like just talking.

932
00:50:48,968 --> 00:50:52,492
So if you want to come up and ask some questions, we'll just head over there and you can talk

933
00:50:52,512 --> 00:50:53,993
to us. Thank you guys for coming.

934
00:50:54,013 --> 00:50:54,694
Thank you guys very much.
