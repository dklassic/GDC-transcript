1
00:00:05,492 --> 00:00:05,692
All right.

2
00:00:06,392 --> 00:00:06,973
Hi, everyone.

3
00:00:07,113 --> 00:00:07,773
I'm Aubrey Sir.

4
00:00:07,893 --> 00:00:09,514
I've been doing level design for 10 years.

5
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:12,156
These days, I run a small indie game company

6
00:00:12,196 --> 00:00:14,358
called 12 East Games, where I still do level design.

7
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:18,500
But I'm better known for my previous work

8
00:00:19,001 --> 00:00:21,382
at Wolfire, where we organized the first Humble Bundle

9
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:22,803
and made games like Overgrowth.

10
00:00:23,844 --> 00:00:26,245
I also collaborate with other indies making art and levels.

11
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:28,887
My focus is on a specific type of level,

12
00:00:28,947 --> 00:00:30,488
which is why I'm here to talk to you at GDC.

13
00:00:31,905 --> 00:00:34,046
Today I'm going to share with you my favorite kind of levels

14
00:00:34,086 --> 00:00:36,548
to design, which I call radically nonlinear levels.

15
00:00:37,468 --> 00:00:38,929
My talk has three sections.

16
00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:41,630
First, I'll define exactly what I mean

17
00:00:41,891 --> 00:00:43,131
by radically nonlinear levels,

18
00:00:43,812 --> 00:00:46,033
how they're based around the idea of free movement

19
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:49,014
and sandbox play, and activating the space.

20
00:00:50,048 --> 00:00:52,170
Second, I'll describe the basics on how to build them,

21
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,391
like layout options and typical dynamics.

22
00:00:55,092 --> 00:00:56,853
And finally, I'll explain some techniques

23
00:00:56,913 --> 00:00:58,835
I use to fix common issues that may come up

24
00:00:59,215 --> 00:01:00,456
in radically nonlinear maps,

25
00:01:00,556 --> 00:01:03,779
like the map feeling empty or not having enough structure.

26
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,241
Then I'll wrap it up with a recap and final example.

27
00:01:08,362 --> 00:01:10,224
But before that, I want to mention an idea

28
00:01:10,344 --> 00:01:12,686
I think we as level designers probably agree with.

29
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,375
That idea is that all conventional levels feature some openness and some linearity.

30
00:01:19,076 --> 00:01:22,540
In other words, all levels have places you can go and places that are blocked.

31
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,305
These are some of our most fundamental level design tools, paths and walls.

32
00:01:28,885 --> 00:01:30,487
Linear levels start with making paths.

33
00:01:30,847 --> 00:01:33,591
Often, even when we talk about nonlinear levels,

34
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:35,834
what's described are levels with branching paths.

35
00:01:36,374 --> 00:01:37,736
These kinds of levels can be great,

36
00:01:37,856 --> 00:01:40,059
but an alternative kind of level

37
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:41,661
is based on the opposite idea.

38
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,343
Instead of building paths,

39
00:01:43,584 --> 00:01:45,406
you start with an area of movable space

40
00:01:45,827 --> 00:01:47,228
and place walls to block the player.

41
00:01:48,223 --> 00:01:51,366
The team behind Hitman calls these types of levels nonlinear sandboxes.

42
00:01:51,966 --> 00:01:56,469
A radically nonlinear level is a sandbox level that is designed to encourage unpredictable

43
00:01:56,529 --> 00:01:59,011
player movement and exploration of the space.

44
00:01:59,972 --> 00:02:03,774
All sorts of single-player levels fit this paradigm, which I'll give some examples of

45
00:02:03,834 --> 00:02:06,196
in a moment, and there's also a lot of stuff in between.

46
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,061
Even highly linear levels have open areas in them,

47
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:13,082
and there is an obvious overlap between this kind of level

48
00:02:13,522 --> 00:02:15,263
and most multiplayer arenas.

49
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,365
I think these techniques apply to any space

50
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:18,425
the player is free to move in.

51
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,947
I hope some of these ideas can help you

52
00:02:21,987 --> 00:02:23,728
in whatever kind of level you might be working on.

53
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,291
Despite that overlap, I think this type of level

54
00:02:28,411 --> 00:02:30,632
is distinct and interesting.

55
00:02:30,992 --> 00:02:32,333
I did not always feel that way, though.

56
00:02:32,693 --> 00:02:35,715
Let me tell you about my first commercial level design job.

57
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:38,315
It was for a game called Darkest of Days.

58
00:02:38,915 --> 00:02:40,236
I was hired as an artist,

59
00:02:40,556 --> 00:02:42,578
but was immediately put to work on level design.

60
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:46,541
Outside of a few Excitebike tracks I made when I was eight,

61
00:02:46,981 --> 00:02:49,023
I had almost no level design experience.

62
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,925
In fact, this was the first major game project

63
00:02:51,945 --> 00:02:52,866
for most of the team.

64
00:02:53,786 --> 00:02:55,447
We had our own custom engine and tools,

65
00:02:55,588 --> 00:02:57,249
but they were lacking some basic functions.

66
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:00,171
For example, the map editor had no undo function.

67
00:03:00,631 --> 00:03:02,273
So in that way, it was a lot like this talk.

68
00:03:03,513 --> 00:03:05,815
I had to try to do everything perfectly the first try.

69
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:11,674
On the one hand, it's nice to get paid to learn.

70
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,659
On the other hand, it's a lot of pressure

71
00:03:13,679 --> 00:03:15,424
to care about your work and not know how to do it.

72
00:03:16,025 --> 00:03:17,269
But don't worry, it turned out okay.

73
00:03:23,354 --> 00:03:25,756
As we were making these maps, our lead engineer, Jeff,

74
00:03:26,056 --> 00:03:28,558
kept mentioning that he thought his test maps

75
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:30,079
were more fun than what we were making.

76
00:03:30,619 --> 00:03:32,541
We were constantly running up against a problem

77
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:33,601
we couldn't reconcile.

78
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:35,743
We wanted to make a cinematic game,

79
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:37,444
like Call of Duty Modern Warfare,

80
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,566
but we also wanted large, dynamic battles in open spaces.

81
00:03:41,327 --> 00:03:43,989
Trying to solve this problem is how I became interested

82
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:45,930
in the idea of radically nonlinear maps,

83
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,651
worked on a lot of games with them,

84
00:03:47,731 --> 00:03:49,973
and ultimately how they became my favorite kind of map.

85
00:03:57,753 --> 00:03:59,294
With that out of the way, here's part one.

86
00:04:00,335 --> 00:04:01,596
I'll define exactly what I mean

87
00:04:01,636 --> 00:04:02,977
by radically nonlinear levels.

88
00:04:05,258 --> 00:04:07,340
When I first started researching this question,

89
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,602
I wanted to find a really fundamental example

90
00:04:09,662 --> 00:04:11,663
of what I meant that everybody would be familiar with.

91
00:04:11,823 --> 00:04:14,325
And the oldest, clearest example I found was Pac-Man,

92
00:04:14,765 --> 00:04:16,187
but we're gonna talk about Ms. Pac-Man

93
00:04:16,207 --> 00:04:17,127
because it's a better game.

94
00:04:17,628 --> 00:04:19,569
So, why Ms. Pac-Man?

95
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:23,172
The map is open enough to offer freeform tactical choices.

96
00:04:24,121 --> 00:04:26,241
like which path to take to avoid ghosts,

97
00:04:26,521 --> 00:04:28,242
and large enough for strategic choices

98
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:30,462
if you're going to eat a power pellet

99
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:31,682
or go for the bonus fruit.

100
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:35,023
The designer of Ms. Pac-Man mentioned

101
00:04:35,043 --> 00:04:36,823
that each ghost has a different behavior,

102
00:04:36,963 --> 00:04:39,444
and in this way, each ghost is a unique risk factor

103
00:04:39,544 --> 00:04:41,244
which the player needs to consider.

104
00:04:42,304 --> 00:04:43,565
And there's some other interesting things

105
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:44,605
about Ms. Pac-Man maps.

106
00:04:45,325 --> 00:04:47,285
It's small enough so that the whole map is in play,

107
00:04:47,565 --> 00:04:49,606
and I'm going to touch on why this is important later.

108
00:04:50,506 --> 00:04:52,326
All the systems are legible in some sense.

109
00:04:52,506 --> 00:04:53,967
Complex enough to be interesting,

110
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,287
but transparent enough to be predictable.

111
00:04:56,827 --> 00:04:57,588
There's no exit.

112
00:04:58,228 --> 00:04:59,848
This is a common thing for this kind of map.

113
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:03,809
Even if a radically non-linear map has an exit,

114
00:05:03,869 --> 00:05:06,269
the player often ignores it until other objectives are met.

115
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,370
In that same way, the starting point isn't very important either.

116
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,611
Because you don't know how the player is going to move through the map,

117
00:05:12,651 --> 00:05:15,391
you have very few tools for pacing in linear storytelling.

118
00:05:16,197 --> 00:05:19,839
Ms. Pac-Man handles tension with dynamic systems where timing is important.

119
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:25,901
Power pellets, ghost respawns, these kinds of dynamic systems are also a reoccurring feature of these maps.

120
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:30,783
At this point you might be thinking, hey Aubrey, do you just mean open world maps?

121
00:05:32,263 --> 00:05:35,445
There are a few big differences between this style of level and an open world.

122
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,205
Before I mentioned the whole map being in play, what if it wasn't?

123
00:05:39,665 --> 00:05:42,590
If we imagine a Ms. Pac-Man level that stretches on indefinitely,

124
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,814
you can just run from the ghosts, you can never eat all the pellets,

125
00:05:45,934 --> 00:05:48,278
and the power pellets become an unlimited resource.

126
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:51,603
In other words, it would have no set challenge and totally different gameplay.

127
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:57,893
Another question is, are these kinds of maps just the same as multiplayer competitive maps

128
00:05:58,153 --> 00:05:58,894
played with bots?

129
00:05:59,634 --> 00:06:01,015
The answer to that is, sort of.

130
00:06:01,435 --> 00:06:06,898
They are similar, but multiplayer competitive maps have a lot of additional design and gameplay

131
00:06:06,938 --> 00:06:07,438
constraints.

132
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,657
like symmetrical balance, leg tolerance,

133
00:06:10,857 --> 00:06:12,998
limited physics that change how you make the map.

134
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:15,540
And so they are really very different in practice.

135
00:06:16,121 --> 00:06:17,982
If you are familiar with MDA theory,

136
00:06:18,022 --> 00:06:21,045
the idea that any game can be categorized by these qualities,

137
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,686
I think you can see that this kind of level

138
00:06:23,126 --> 00:06:26,909
occupies a distinct mechanics, dynamics, aesthetic niche,

139
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,671
apart from multiplayer arenas.

140
00:06:30,572 --> 00:06:33,535
Ms. Pac-Man was made in 1982. That is a long time ago.

141
00:06:34,556 --> 00:06:36,877
Is it even still relevant to modern level design?

142
00:06:37,924 --> 00:06:40,926
Here is why I think so. If you look at Doom 2016,

143
00:06:41,707 --> 00:06:44,109
you see that many of the levels have linear sections

144
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:46,170
punctuated by nonlinear arenas.

145
00:06:46,811 --> 00:06:49,593
In last year's talk, Embracing Push-Forward Combat in Doom,

146
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:52,475
they point out that these spaces were a byproduct

147
00:06:52,755 --> 00:06:55,177
of two of their core gameplay loop goals,

148
00:06:55,537 --> 00:06:58,560
constant movement and improvisation in navigation.

149
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,703
This causes 360-degree combat and resulted in maps

150
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:06,145
that they felt had more in common with multiplayer levels

151
00:07:06,345 --> 00:07:07,646
than traditional linear levels.

152
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:14,333
DOOM 2016 levels are a great example of a hybrid approach

153
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:16,034
and it's part of a cycle away from

154
00:07:16,154 --> 00:07:18,095
shooting gallery style design that peaked around 2008

155
00:07:18,495 --> 00:07:23,398
and a return to less linear design like the original DOOM.

156
00:07:23,678 --> 00:07:25,919
And I think this trend still has a lot of room to continue.

157
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,601
People are innovating in this area every year,

158
00:07:28,901 --> 00:07:30,762
which is one of the reasons I wanted to give this talk.

159
00:07:33,557 --> 00:07:36,339
As I was saying with the Doom series and Pac-Man,

160
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,661
these kinds of levels have a long history,

161
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:41,104
including games like Tenchu, Battlestone 98,

162
00:07:41,164 --> 00:07:42,745
and there's a lot of modern examples, too,

163
00:07:42,805 --> 00:07:45,488
like Metal Gear Solid, Ground Zeroes, or Hitman,

164
00:07:45,828 --> 00:07:47,910
where they tried more linear levels in Absolution

165
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,412
and backed away from them with the more recent Hitman games,

166
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:54,016
which we heard a little bit about earlier today.

167
00:07:55,623 --> 00:07:57,806
The design techniques I'm going to talk about later

168
00:07:57,886 --> 00:07:59,207
can also be applied to games

169
00:07:59,247 --> 00:08:01,530
that use pre-designed tiles for randomized levels,

170
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,453
like Spelunky, which I'll show a little bit

171
00:08:03,473 --> 00:08:04,374
in my final example.

172
00:08:05,976 --> 00:08:08,299
So, what makes radically nonlinear maps cool?

173
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:10,141
Why do I like building and playing them?

174
00:08:10,581 --> 00:08:11,502
There are a few reasons.

175
00:08:12,838 --> 00:08:15,099
One of the things you notice about the games I have mentioned

176
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,240
is that they emphasize gameplay over story.

177
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,541
Remember how I said our programmer,

178
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:21,082
Jeff, preferred his test level?

179
00:08:21,302 --> 00:08:23,303
It is because a more open map

180
00:08:23,363 --> 00:08:25,564
allows the gameplay systems more room to breathe.

181
00:08:26,164 --> 00:08:28,305
Some types of gameplay that really benefit from this

182
00:08:28,365 --> 00:08:31,166
are long-range engagements using vehicles and stealth,

183
00:08:31,706 --> 00:08:34,067
and gameplay based around controlling enemy movement.

184
00:08:35,087 --> 00:08:38,589
This gives players a lot of choice with more agency

185
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:40,709
to make strategic and tactical decisions.

186
00:08:41,765 --> 00:08:46,171
Map knowledge is important in this kind of level, and so exploration is naturally rewarded.

187
00:08:46,972 --> 00:08:51,377
Because there's no need for fail-safe funneling of the player, destructible terrain or killing

188
00:08:51,477 --> 00:08:52,879
any character become options.

189
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,797
They also emphasize dynamic and environmental storytelling.

190
00:08:57,277 --> 00:08:58,938
Because of fewer artificial barriers,

191
00:08:59,158 --> 00:09:01,439
it is easier to feature realistic locations

192
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,239
and architecture.

193
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,560
And as I was mentioning before,

194
00:09:05,081 --> 00:09:06,761
aspects of radically nonlinear design

195
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:08,402
can be implemented in all sorts of maps.

196
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,624
That is a lot of stuff that I think makes these kinds of maps

197
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:12,964
cool, but the most important thing,

198
00:09:13,484 --> 00:09:14,965
isn't it just fun to scout around,

199
00:09:15,025 --> 00:09:16,206
come up with a plan and test it?

200
00:09:16,706 --> 00:09:18,687
I love the kind of level that lets me come up

201
00:09:18,727 --> 00:09:19,787
with different solutions,

202
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:22,028
and that I can play twice with totally different outcomes.

203
00:09:29,123 --> 00:09:29,743
It's just water.

204
00:09:32,946 --> 00:09:33,386
Part 2.

205
00:09:33,887 --> 00:09:35,969
Here are some techniques on how to build these kinds of levels.

206
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,653
I'm going to borrow and adapt some theory from Randy Smith's 2006 GDC talk,

207
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,355
Level Building for Stealth Gameplay.

208
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:46,175
Let me take a moment to explain this diagram here.

209
00:09:46,675 --> 00:09:48,636
This is an overhead view of a map from Thief,

210
00:09:49,036 --> 00:09:52,338
and we see how Smith used these safe areas and rewards

211
00:09:52,478 --> 00:09:54,860
shown with plus signs and enemies and exposure

212
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,621
shown with negative signs to predict

213
00:09:56,661 --> 00:09:57,722
and control the player's path.

214
00:09:58,562 --> 00:10:00,063
I want to use them in the opposite way

215
00:10:00,163 --> 00:10:02,785
so that it becomes impossible to predict the player's path.

216
00:10:03,425 --> 00:10:05,846
This is what makes our level radically nonlinear

217
00:10:05,967 --> 00:10:08,028
and also how we activate the entire space

218
00:10:08,068 --> 00:10:08,908
of the level for play.

219
00:10:10,724 --> 00:10:12,626
The first thing I do when I start on a new map

220
00:10:12,686 --> 00:10:14,687
is to have a clear idea about the layout.

221
00:10:15,068 --> 00:10:16,228
By picking a strong layout,

222
00:10:16,268 --> 00:10:18,810
you'll be able to differentiate each map you make,

223
00:10:18,991 --> 00:10:22,173
rather than ending up with a random hodgepodge of obstacles,

224
00:10:22,273 --> 00:10:23,174
enemies, and rewards.

225
00:10:24,555 --> 00:10:26,356
There are a lot of different possibilities for layout,

226
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:29,279
but here are four solid examples.

227
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:30,760
Symmetric.

228
00:10:31,554 --> 00:10:34,956
We have a low-tension center line with a left-right choice.

229
00:10:35,617 --> 00:10:36,858
This is an interesting layout

230
00:10:36,898 --> 00:10:39,039
because the player chooses which side to tackle first,

231
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:42,161
and then halfway through comes back to the center line.

232
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,323
That helps break up the tempo and creates pacing.

233
00:10:45,744 --> 00:10:48,005
This is a great layout when the theme of the map

234
00:10:48,085 --> 00:10:49,866
is a major path like a highway.

235
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:53,649
Concentric, the outer area of the map is safer

236
00:10:54,169 --> 00:10:56,751
and rewards extensive scouting before committing to the center.

237
00:10:57,432 --> 00:11:00,914
This layout works well for maps about assaulting a base or castle.

238
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,172
Node, these are a series of clearings

239
00:11:04,192 --> 00:11:05,633
that interconnect in a lot of ways.

240
00:11:06,214 --> 00:11:08,875
This is the kind of, this kind of map keeps up a high tempo

241
00:11:09,596 --> 00:11:11,838
of quickly alternating encounters with travel.

242
00:11:12,898 --> 00:11:14,840
The player needs to resolve challenges carefully

243
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,081
so that they don't bleed into other adjacent nodes

244
00:11:17,141 --> 00:11:18,202
in unpredictable ways.

245
00:11:18,582 --> 00:11:20,804
This layout fits with ruins or slums.

246
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:24,034
Field, a large area of increasing risk.

247
00:11:24,654 --> 00:11:27,456
This layout promotes alternating probing attacks and retreating,

248
00:11:27,936 --> 00:11:29,857
and gives the player a lot of control over tempo.

249
00:11:30,277 --> 00:11:32,718
This is a typical layout for something like a beach assault.

250
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,440
Again, the main point here is not to know

251
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,221
what the player will do, but just to make sure

252
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:38,881
that whatever they do, it is not boring.

253
00:11:39,942 --> 00:11:42,143
One thing to note here is that it is also possible

254
00:11:42,183 --> 00:11:44,004
to use gameplay systems for the layout

255
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:45,545
rather than building it into the map,

256
00:11:45,825 --> 00:11:48,006
and I will have an example of that using a field layout

257
00:11:48,186 --> 00:11:48,966
at the end of the talk.

258
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:52,757
As well as layout, I like to have a clear grasp

259
00:11:52,797 --> 00:11:54,898
of how the gameplay is going to be unique for the level.

260
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:57,780
One method is to try to find an aspect of gameplay

261
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,480
that is underutilized and focus on it.

262
00:11:59,921 --> 00:12:02,102
This is hard to generalize since every game is different,

263
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:03,923
but here are some concrete examples

264
00:12:04,303 --> 00:12:05,423
from some maps I worked on.

265
00:12:06,584 --> 00:12:08,745
This is Brigador, an isometric shooter

266
00:12:08,785 --> 00:12:10,746
that was designed from the start to allow players

267
00:12:10,766 --> 00:12:12,086
to use a wide range of vehicles.

268
00:12:12,747 --> 00:12:15,228
Because of this, it had some interesting design constraints.

269
00:12:15,448 --> 00:12:17,289
For example, within the interior of the map,

270
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:18,610
all the terrain is destructible.

271
00:12:20,071 --> 00:12:21,972
In this game, certain aspects are randomized,

272
00:12:22,192 --> 00:12:24,254
which is one of the easiest ways to ensure players

273
00:12:24,314 --> 00:12:27,636
try different strategies on repeated playthroughs.

274
00:12:28,576 --> 00:12:30,257
Here, the enemy spawns are hand-placed,

275
00:12:30,858 --> 00:12:32,699
and whether an enemy actually appears

276
00:12:32,739 --> 00:12:33,920
depends on several factors.

277
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,801
Similarly, the player will randomly enter the map

278
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:38,142
from one of these two locations.

279
00:12:39,003 --> 00:12:40,984
I think this technique of using hand-placed spawns

280
00:12:41,004 --> 00:12:43,125
for enemies and rewards that are then controlled

281
00:12:43,165 --> 00:12:45,046
by systemic factors is really useful.

282
00:12:46,548 --> 00:12:49,791
The gameplay idea for this map is that the center area is a trap.

283
00:12:49,931 --> 00:12:53,754
It's tempting, but if you go in there before picking off most of the enemies,

284
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:54,815
you'll probably fail.

285
00:12:55,515 --> 00:12:58,898
As you can see from the main travel lines, this map is roughly concentric.

286
00:13:00,099 --> 00:13:02,421
The main hazards and rewards are concentrated in the middle

287
00:13:02,461 --> 00:13:03,802
to draw the players into the trap.

288
00:13:04,162 --> 00:13:07,245
It's possible to clear the map by defeating enough enemies around the border,

289
00:13:07,365 --> 00:13:08,586
so you don't need to go in the center.

290
00:13:09,406 --> 00:13:11,166
but it is a lot faster to beat the map

291
00:13:11,226 --> 00:13:12,747
if you complete these central objectives.

292
00:13:13,567 --> 00:13:15,068
In that way, the concept of the map,

293
00:13:15,488 --> 00:13:17,348
that it is a trap to lure the player in,

294
00:13:17,728 --> 00:13:19,869
and the layout of the map, that it is concentric,

295
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:21,489
relate to and support each other.

296
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,870
Here is another example from Brigador.

297
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,731
The game has soft cover that blocks line of sight,

298
00:13:26,771 --> 00:13:28,231
but does not offer much protection.

299
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,832
In the existing maps, it was mostly combined

300
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,512
with hard cover to add variety,

301
00:13:32,972 --> 00:13:35,513
but I wanted to replace the hard cover with mud pits

302
00:13:35,553 --> 00:13:38,614
to give a really dangerous, exposed feeling to this map.

303
00:13:39,721 --> 00:13:41,202
This layout is one I have not shown yet,

304
00:13:41,743 --> 00:13:43,484
where the objectives are in the four corners.

305
00:13:43,944 --> 00:13:46,006
This means the player has to cover a lot of distance,

306
00:13:46,186 --> 00:13:48,909
which emphasizes even more how exposed the player is.

307
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,831
I think this shows how it is important to pick a concept

308
00:13:52,191 --> 00:13:53,893
and a layout that work well together.

309
00:13:54,973 --> 00:13:56,975
Here is a different game I worked on called Ravenfield,

310
00:13:57,155 --> 00:13:59,257
a single-player game where you capture control points

311
00:13:59,317 --> 00:14:03,100
and shoot enemies in an effort to outscore the opposing army.

312
00:14:03,621 --> 00:14:05,222
Unlike similar multiplayer games,

313
00:14:05,582 --> 00:14:07,644
the levels in Ravenfield do not actually have

314
00:14:07,684 --> 00:14:09,145
to be balanced or fair.

315
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:14,700
On this map, I was motivated by my frustration of the AI

316
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,642
allies taking all the airplanes on the other maps,

317
00:14:17,882 --> 00:14:19,943
so I made a map with a lot of airplanes in it.

318
00:14:20,864 --> 00:14:22,705
During production, I bumped the starting bases

319
00:14:22,785 --> 00:14:25,727
out to the corners of the map to maximize playable space

320
00:14:25,787 --> 00:14:27,087
for the fast-moving airplanes,

321
00:14:27,347 --> 00:14:29,909
but kept the roughly symmetrical layout.

322
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,291
Unlike my previous example of this kind of layout,

323
00:14:33,591 --> 00:14:35,972
this is an inversion where the center line is more risky,

324
00:14:36,112 --> 00:14:37,693
and these side areas are a bit safer.

325
00:14:39,074 --> 00:14:42,456
I think this works because in the aircraft, you have to keep moving and naturally end

326
00:14:42,497 --> 00:14:43,638
up flying over the center line.

327
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:49,282
All of these examples benefited a lot from being for functional games with several existing

328
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:49,603
maps.

329
00:14:50,183 --> 00:14:54,947
In cases like this, it's pretty easy to play with existing systems, make tests, and figure

330
00:14:54,987 --> 00:14:55,768
out something that works.

331
00:14:56,529 --> 00:15:01,453
If, however, your game isn't very finished, you may notice your map has serious problems

332
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:02,214
and not know why.

333
00:15:11,193 --> 00:15:13,334
Okay, welcome to the third and final part of this talk,

334
00:15:13,374 --> 00:15:16,477
How to Fix Common Issues, or Why Is Your Map All Busted?

335
00:15:17,678 --> 00:15:19,839
The number one issue is that the map is too linear.

336
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,321
It is very tempting to want to guide the player

337
00:15:22,361 --> 00:15:24,142
and reflexively fall back on that skill set.

338
00:15:24,463 --> 00:15:26,024
But if you are going to design a linear map

339
00:15:26,404 --> 00:15:27,725
or have linear map sections,

340
00:15:28,145 --> 00:15:29,987
it is important to go all in on good pacing

341
00:15:30,027 --> 00:15:31,948
and have all of those existing techniques

342
00:15:31,968 --> 00:15:33,349
that make that style of map work.

343
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,532
Otherwise, open up more paths and space to move.

344
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:40,653
Similar to the above, but with gameplay,

345
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:43,315
you have one idea in mind with how to win the map.

346
00:15:43,715 --> 00:15:46,177
This can stifle organic and robust gameplay systems.

347
00:15:47,017 --> 00:15:49,539
It is important to avoid trying to restrict the gameplay too much.

348
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:52,021
Trust that the core gameplay is fun on its own.

349
00:15:52,981 --> 00:15:55,443
Another possible issue is that the map has no structure.

350
00:15:55,503 --> 00:15:56,704
The map is too uniform,

351
00:15:56,744 --> 00:15:58,645
so you end up doing the same things over and over.

352
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:02,528
Hopefully, by having a unique layout and concept,

353
00:16:02,608 --> 00:16:03,548
you avoid this issue.

354
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,390
In a game with very dynamic systems,

355
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,391
sometimes the player can feel helpless.

356
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:12,105
The level should be balanced so it is reactive to the player,

357
00:16:12,245 --> 00:16:14,867
and they act as the tipping point for the gameplay systems.

358
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,210
The gameplay can feel random or nonexistent.

359
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:21,053
The player is not able to see the cause and effect of the systems

360
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,834
enough to understand why things happen.

361
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:26,898
For example, using an invisible trigger to spawn enemies on the map

362
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,580
is a lot worse than an alarm state in a stealth game.

363
00:16:30,421 --> 00:16:33,924
Alarm state gameplay still has triggers and still spawns enemies,

364
00:16:34,265 --> 00:16:35,906
but gives the player a lot more information.

365
00:16:36,587 --> 00:16:39,448
If you want to learn more about making systems legible to new players,

366
00:16:39,608 --> 00:16:42,830
I very much suggest watching the GDC 2016 talk titled

367
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:46,172
Level Design in Hitman, Guiding Players in a Nonlinear Sandbox.

368
00:16:47,292 --> 00:16:50,394
These previous issues can usually be fixed,

369
00:16:50,494 --> 00:16:53,055
assuming you have mechanical complexity to work with.

370
00:16:53,635 --> 00:16:56,797
But if you don't, then it may be something to bring up with your design team.

371
00:16:57,985 --> 00:17:00,767
The sorts of systems these games usually have are things like stealth,

372
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:03,389
AI companions, inventory looting, destructible terrain,

373
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,151
dynamic enemy movement,

374
00:17:05,511 --> 00:17:07,212
player tools for controlling the enemy,

375
00:17:07,632 --> 00:17:12,176
sub-objectives like capturing areas or destroying enemy resources.

376
00:17:12,636 --> 00:17:16,119
They have pacing systems and various movement modes,

377
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:17,540
like vehicles, et cetera.

378
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,761
When discussing how these systems work,

379
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:22,103
having a map that feels like it is missing something

380
00:17:22,403 --> 00:17:24,385
to show the rest of the team can be very useful.

381
00:17:26,308 --> 00:17:27,889
On the other hand, if what seems to be missing

382
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:29,229
is grand cinematic moments,

383
00:17:29,509 --> 00:17:31,610
tight pacing, or very well-defined challenges,

384
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,631
I'm not aware of any way to fix this yet.

385
00:17:34,712 --> 00:17:37,373
It's part of the trade-off that comes with this kind of map,

386
00:17:37,693 --> 00:17:39,754
which may not be the best choice for your project.

387
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:41,895
It isn't that dramatic scenes

388
00:17:41,956 --> 00:17:43,596
or clear challenges can't happen,

389
00:17:43,676 --> 00:17:45,897
but they tend to result from the existing systems,

390
00:17:46,618 --> 00:17:47,998
and so they're hard to predict.

391
00:17:48,999 --> 00:17:50,880
I don't think this is an impossible problem, though,

392
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,681
because there's been a lot of exciting progress

393
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:54,222
in dynamic storytelling lately.

394
00:18:05,795 --> 00:18:08,336
Before I end my talk, I just want to recap with an example

395
00:18:08,376 --> 00:18:10,936
that brings it all together and shows how a lot of this theory

396
00:18:10,976 --> 00:18:12,357
can work in a more linear game.

397
00:18:14,057 --> 00:18:15,637
The game I will use for this final example

398
00:18:15,657 --> 00:18:18,738
is one that I was in charge of level design on called Receiver.

399
00:18:19,358 --> 00:18:21,119
It has some aspects of linear design,

400
00:18:21,459 --> 00:18:23,859
but still allows free and unpredictable movement.

401
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:26,380
The level was made from tiles.

402
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,881
Each tile is roughly the size of a small office building

403
00:18:29,921 --> 00:18:32,581
and has three floors with doors on each side.

404
00:18:33,261 --> 00:18:34,241
These act as lanes.

405
00:18:35,273 --> 00:18:36,593
When these tiles are put end-to-end,

406
00:18:36,633 --> 00:18:38,795
the lanes can combine or switch positions.

407
00:18:39,475 --> 00:18:40,755
If I had just stuck these together,

408
00:18:40,795 --> 00:18:44,037
I would say it was similar to a multi-path level,

409
00:18:44,077 --> 00:18:45,157
kind of like Deus Ex.

410
00:18:46,164 --> 00:18:48,065
But we did something a little bit different.

411
00:18:48,865 --> 00:18:50,626
Instead, the tiles are randomly placed,

412
00:18:50,646 --> 00:18:53,508
so the player often has multiple choices about how to progress.

413
00:18:54,348 --> 00:18:57,370
In addition to the strategic choice of which lane to take,

414
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:00,272
the tactical choice of the best path through the tile

415
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:03,774
also isn't predetermined either, because the enemies

416
00:19:03,834 --> 00:19:05,395
and objectives are spawned randomly

417
00:19:05,735 --> 00:19:07,036
from hand-placed spawn points.

418
00:19:07,957 --> 00:19:09,599
This is how the space is activated.

419
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,004
Even though almost all this content was pre-authored

420
00:19:13,224 --> 00:19:15,107
and the random elements are fairly minor,

421
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:17,510
it's still enough to change the ideal strategy

422
00:19:18,111 --> 00:19:19,913
and to incentivize exploring the space,

423
00:19:20,234 --> 00:19:22,276
which makes the level radically non-linear.

424
00:19:23,347 --> 00:19:25,547
Because of these systems, it made it difficult

425
00:19:25,587 --> 00:19:26,847
to support a standard narrative.

426
00:19:27,528 --> 00:19:30,388
Instead, we made the objective to find these audio logs,

427
00:19:30,428 --> 00:19:31,649
which can play in any order.

428
00:19:32,349 --> 00:19:34,989
Obviously, this doesn't result in the most traditional story,

429
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:36,890
but I still think it added to the experience.

430
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:40,071
That said, the story wasn't the strongest aspect of this game.

431
00:19:40,771 --> 00:19:43,411
This was part of the trade-off we decided to make.

432
00:19:45,372 --> 00:19:46,952
Another gameplay system at work here

433
00:19:46,992 --> 00:19:49,133
is that each new tile is harder than the last one.

434
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:55,112
This gives the player an incentive to check all the lanes in a given tile, which may require some backtracking.

435
00:19:56,253 --> 00:20:02,216
As I mentioned when I was talking about Ms. Pac-Man, a systems-based approach to tension is an important pacing tool.

436
00:20:02,616 --> 00:20:11,942
And I think this could have been boring in some games, but because receiver is extremely high tension, backtracking serves as a much-needed break from clearing new areas.

437
00:20:12,973 --> 00:20:15,755
This increasing difficulty as you move forward

438
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,896
also provides a layout structure

439
00:20:17,956 --> 00:20:19,897
I mentioned earlier called field.

440
00:20:21,398 --> 00:20:23,559
Because these levels do not have a lot of scripted events

441
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,122
or built-in gameplay, they may seem a bit simplistic,

442
00:20:27,522 --> 00:20:29,183
but part of making a map in this style

443
00:20:29,243 --> 00:20:31,144
is to not obstruct the core gameplay.

444
00:20:31,925 --> 00:20:33,326
In Receiver, most of the gameplay

445
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:37,949
is built around a realistic simulation of a gun,

446
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:40,230
including all the working parts and buttons.

447
00:20:41,214 --> 00:20:43,618
We surfaced all this gameplay for novice players

448
00:20:43,658 --> 00:20:45,762
with a context-sensitive help system.

449
00:20:46,283 --> 00:20:47,585
This makes it clear to the players

450
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:48,947
that every bullet is precious

451
00:20:49,368 --> 00:20:51,492
and that every enemy encounter is difficult

452
00:20:51,552 --> 00:20:54,257
simply because firing your gun is difficult.

453
00:20:55,231 --> 00:20:58,334
This relates directly to the levels because you can scavenge bullets,

454
00:20:58,795 --> 00:21:03,480
and obviously cover and enemy positions matter more when the situations are so lethal.

455
00:21:04,281 --> 00:21:07,524
I think these levels do a good job of giving the player interesting choices

456
00:21:07,564 --> 00:21:10,968
while staying out of the way enough to let the core gameplay shine.

457
00:21:12,153 --> 00:21:14,815
By working closely with your gameplay coder,

458
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,717
and because the core gameplay was so deep,

459
00:21:16,917 --> 00:21:18,758
my job was made a lot easier,

460
00:21:18,979 --> 00:21:21,460
and I was able to avoid any really tricky problems.

461
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:24,603
Part of that was making tradeoffs early in development

462
00:21:24,643 --> 00:21:26,084
to avoid those kinds of problems.

463
00:21:27,225 --> 00:21:29,706
In the end, focusing on interesting dynamics

464
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,188
that shift rewards and hazards,

465
00:21:31,788 --> 00:21:33,369
keeping layout and pacing in mind,

466
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,931
and giving the gameplay room to breathe

467
00:21:36,151 --> 00:21:38,653
really helped receivers' radically nonlinear levels

468
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:39,294
come together.

469
00:21:40,361 --> 00:21:41,702
Finally, I would like to say,

470
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:44,223
I feel like this is a complicated topic,

471
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:48,124
and because these maps integrate so closely to the gameplay,

472
00:21:48,484 --> 00:21:50,285
they are a bit slippery to nail down.

473
00:21:50,545 --> 00:21:52,426
But I think they really are a distinct

474
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:53,946
and interesting style of map

475
00:21:54,267 --> 00:21:55,947
with their own history and design trends.

476
00:21:56,668 --> 00:21:58,828
Hopefully, I have provided some concrete ideas

477
00:21:58,948 --> 00:22:00,289
on building a map like this,

478
00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:02,750
and how to approach certain problems,

479
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:06,371
whether your future levels are radically nonlinear or not.

480
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,052
Thank you for coming to my talk.

481
00:22:15,831 --> 00:22:19,296
And it looks like we have time for plenty of questions.

482
00:22:21,459 --> 00:22:23,743
If you have any questions, you can go to the mics.

483
00:22:28,985 --> 00:22:29,946
Hello and thank you for the talk.

484
00:22:30,327 --> 00:22:30,787
Oh, thanks.

485
00:22:31,067 --> 00:22:33,770
So you mentioned that it is a constant challenge

486
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,173
being able to nail the level design just right

487
00:22:36,673 --> 00:22:38,054
before shipping the game.

488
00:22:38,655 --> 00:22:40,677
Now, the industry has changed over the years,

489
00:22:40,737 --> 00:22:43,540
and now we have tools to measure all sorts of things.

490
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,724
What's your approach to nailing down the interesting parts?

491
00:22:49,922 --> 00:22:53,904
Up to now, what I've mostly done is just have playtests do early builds

492
00:22:54,224 --> 00:22:57,405
and just give player feedback, watch people stream the game.

493
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:02,027
I personally like, more than trying to collect metrics through the game,

494
00:23:02,167 --> 00:23:06,709
I like to watch live playtests where I can see the player's face.

495
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:12,152
So you can get a kind of a more immediate read on what they're reacting to.

496
00:23:13,513 --> 00:23:13,753
Thank you.

497
00:23:17,757 --> 00:23:20,899
Hey, what do you think of the dangers and benefits

498
00:23:20,939 --> 00:23:23,861
of using procedural generation with these kind of levels?

499
00:23:25,082 --> 00:23:27,824
I think it should be kept to a minimum.

500
00:23:28,465 --> 00:23:30,026
Like, it's a very useful tool.

501
00:23:30,206 --> 00:23:32,688
I know that there's been recently a lot of like,

502
00:23:33,728 --> 00:23:37,391
kind of negativity towards procedural generation.

503
00:23:38,312 --> 00:23:41,174
And I don't think that's really makes much sense.

504
00:23:42,414 --> 00:23:43,495
But at the same time.

505
00:23:45,442 --> 00:23:47,744
Sometimes you just want the Level to play a certain way,

506
00:23:48,424 --> 00:23:52,848
and by introducing just a tiny bit of random elements,

507
00:23:52,908 --> 00:23:56,211
you can massively expand the playability of a map.

508
00:23:57,291 --> 00:24:00,134
So, yeah, I try to use it sparingly.

509
00:24:04,678 --> 00:24:05,899
So, as an educator,

510
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,780
I'm at Breda University in the Netherlands.

511
00:24:09,221 --> 00:24:12,564
We have a lot of room to do multiple Level design projects

512
00:24:12,604 --> 00:24:13,245
in our curriculum.

513
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:19,597
but one of the things I have to kind of figure out is how we build complexity for the students,

514
00:24:19,718 --> 00:24:26,144
so like where we start simple and then build up, and some parts of that are easy, like single

515
00:24:26,184 --> 00:24:32,971
player platform game level design is a nice starting point, but do you think the linearity

516
00:24:33,191 --> 00:24:37,896
and non-linearity, is that more difficult or? I think that

517
00:24:39,054 --> 00:24:43,337
especially now, making a really compelling linear experience

518
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:45,660
is extremely difficult.

519
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,223
So, and it's mostly different disciplines,

520
00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:52,666
like more about storytelling, environmental narrative.

521
00:24:54,227 --> 00:24:56,788
My last game I made was totally linear, totally,

522
00:24:57,108 --> 00:24:59,709
totally linear, totally linear like adventure game.

523
00:25:00,129 --> 00:25:02,629
So I'm well acquainted with those problems.

524
00:25:02,889 --> 00:25:05,410
And yeah, I think they're both really difficult,

525
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:06,150
just different.

526
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:09,611
So non-linearity is more of like a sideways shift?

527
00:25:09,651 --> 00:25:12,592
Yeah, just like a different set of skills.

528
00:25:12,652 --> 00:25:14,873
OK, cool.

529
00:25:15,273 --> 00:25:17,373
So thank you for the talk.

530
00:25:17,953 --> 00:25:20,474
I wanted to know, you mentioned at the start

531
00:25:20,514 --> 00:25:22,895
that the making of the levels is like.

532
00:25:23,907 --> 00:25:28,491
making sure what space is blocked and what space is open.

533
00:25:29,012 --> 00:25:31,494
But in this kind of non-linear level,

534
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:35,497
where you opened up a lot of the space,

535
00:25:35,637 --> 00:25:37,719
let's say one problem may be

536
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:41,242
if the player has a lot of freedom of movement,

537
00:25:41,682 --> 00:25:43,984
not necessarily that they can fly,

538
00:25:44,064 --> 00:25:45,285
but let's say, I don't know,

539
00:25:45,366 --> 00:25:47,127
they can climb walls or something like that.

540
00:25:48,128 --> 00:25:52,011
How can you make, let's say, obstacles or walls

541
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:57,465
actually are obstacles without impeding the core gameplay in that way.

542
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:01,072
So yeah, one of the games that I didn't mention

543
00:26:01,112 --> 00:26:03,834
because I had a lot of trouble with this exact problem

544
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:06,655
was Overgrowth because your character is this rabbit

545
00:26:06,695 --> 00:26:10,758
and he can jump like 30 feet in the air

546
00:26:10,818 --> 00:26:12,178
and run 40 miles per hour.

547
00:26:12,979 --> 00:26:16,041
And you're just like flying past everything at top speed

548
00:26:16,081 --> 00:26:17,141
and going anywhere you want.

549
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,843
And yeah, this is a really difficult problem.

550
00:26:19,863 --> 00:26:22,965
And I would, you know, I think ultimately

551
00:26:23,005 --> 00:26:25,886
you have to have those kinds of movement options

552
00:26:26,066 --> 00:26:26,867
cost something.

553
00:26:27,785 --> 00:26:29,026
at least a little bit of something

554
00:26:29,106 --> 00:26:33,870
so that you can have some gradient in the player behavior,

555
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:37,032
or else they are just going to beeline to the objective

556
00:26:37,072 --> 00:26:39,274
and jump over everything because their character is Superman.

557
00:26:39,674 --> 00:26:40,635
OK.

558
00:26:40,795 --> 00:26:41,075
Thank you.

559
00:26:41,376 --> 00:26:41,656
Thanks.

560
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:46,900
Kaisho Escurigasco, thank you for the talk.

561
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,681
I recognize this may be a little bit outside

562
00:26:48,721 --> 00:26:50,122
of your field of expertise, but I'm

563
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:53,105
curious about the overlaps with VR projects

564
00:26:53,165 --> 00:26:55,506
in terms of linear and non-linear design

565
00:26:55,586 --> 00:26:56,187
and explorations.

566
00:26:56,227 --> 00:26:56,347
Yeah.

567
00:26:57,594 --> 00:27:01,515
There is a VR version of Receiver,

568
00:27:02,655 --> 00:27:04,496
but I've only played it a little bit.

569
00:27:06,677 --> 00:27:10,898
And I'm not sure, I think it basically works.

570
00:27:11,318 --> 00:27:13,219
I don't think it's massively different.

571
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,540
It's maybe a little bit more confusing

572
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,221
when you can't whip your head around and get,

573
00:27:19,521 --> 00:27:21,602
for some people, maybe less confusing for others.

574
00:27:22,342 --> 00:27:22,882
I'm not sure.

575
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:25,963
But I haven't done extensive player testing

576
00:27:26,003 --> 00:27:26,743
with that kind of thing.

577
00:27:29,192 --> 00:27:29,473
Thank you.

578
00:27:31,017 --> 00:27:31,518
Anyone else?

579
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:35,609
Thanks for coming to my talk.
