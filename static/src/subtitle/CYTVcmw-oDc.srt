1
00:00:06,104 --> 00:00:07,044
Let's do this.

2
00:00:07,084 --> 00:00:07,164
OK.

3
00:00:07,184 --> 00:00:10,025
So these are our faces and our names.

4
00:00:11,285 --> 00:00:11,825
My name's Alex.

5
00:00:11,926 --> 00:00:13,946
I'm the founder of an indie hardware game company

6
00:00:13,966 --> 00:00:14,766
called Sensible Object.

7
00:00:15,507 --> 00:00:17,567
There's about eight of us in London working

8
00:00:17,627 --> 00:00:19,708
out of a maker space, but a whole bunch more people

9
00:00:19,748 --> 00:00:21,708
who work with the studio here in the US.

10
00:00:22,229 --> 00:00:25,209
Before that, I ran a games agency called Hide and Seek.

11
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,691
Super keen for tweets, feedback through Ammonite.

12
00:00:29,771 --> 00:00:31,151
That's me and Beast of Balance.

13
00:00:32,172 --> 00:00:32,932
So yeah, hello.

14
00:00:33,092 --> 00:00:33,292
Hi.

15
00:00:33,612 --> 00:00:34,112
This is Robin.

16
00:00:34,472 --> 00:00:35,492
Yeah, hi, I'm Robin.

17
00:00:36,032 --> 00:00:37,313
I'm an independent game developer,

18
00:00:37,653 --> 00:00:41,073
and I used to do mobile games in London,

19
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:43,314
and now I do just experimental hardware stuff.

20
00:00:43,974 --> 00:00:45,874
And how that works out, I'm going

21
00:00:45,894 --> 00:00:48,455
to talk about during this talk.

22
00:00:48,995 --> 00:00:51,155
And the main focus of this talk for me

23
00:00:51,235 --> 00:00:54,056
will be Line Wobbler and for you, Beast of Balance.

24
00:00:54,076 --> 00:00:58,837
So we have a short intro prepared of the game,

25
00:00:59,197 --> 00:01:00,737
but I also brought it on stage.

26
00:01:01,357 --> 00:01:02,097
So this is the game.

27
00:01:02,377 --> 00:01:03,178
Physical things.

28
00:01:03,258 --> 00:01:03,818
Woop.

29
00:01:03,838 --> 00:01:05,799
So let's try to switch it on.

30
00:01:06,339 --> 00:01:06,499
Yes.

31
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:06,979
Yeah.

32
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:07,420
All right.

33
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:08,680
It's working.

34
00:01:11,441 --> 00:01:15,423
So for those of you who don't know the game, it's a one-dimensional dungeon crawler.

35
00:01:15,783 --> 00:01:19,705
So you control this green light, and it's kind of impossible for me now to play it,

36
00:01:20,025 --> 00:01:22,767
but you're trying to avoid these red lights down there, because when you hit them, you

37
00:01:23,287 --> 00:01:24,887
kind of die a colorful death.

38
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:28,169
So what you try is you kind of get close, and you kind of fling the spring.

39
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,180
I have to kind of guess.

40
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,201
Blind Wobbler.

41
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:33,561
This is a new version.

42
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:33,921
Whoa.

43
00:01:34,042 --> 00:01:34,382
Amazing.

44
00:01:34,442 --> 00:01:35,242
Blind Wobbler.

45
00:01:35,802 --> 00:01:36,503
You heard it here first.

46
00:01:36,523 --> 00:01:37,623
All right.

47
00:01:37,923 --> 00:01:38,263
Yeah.

48
00:01:38,384 --> 00:01:39,324
So that's the game.

49
00:01:40,104 --> 00:01:41,325
And of course, the Blind Wobbler.

50
00:01:41,925 --> 00:01:42,165
Yeah.

51
00:01:42,926 --> 00:01:43,206
Okay.

52
00:01:45,627 --> 00:01:47,448
And I also brought what I made.

53
00:01:47,528 --> 00:01:51,349
So there's the box, Beasts of Balance, and some of the pieces, the Beasts of Balance.

54
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,070
And here is the trailer.

55
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:56,013
So, what was kind of interesting about being invited to do this talk together is that Robin

56
00:02:56,053 --> 00:03:03,356
and I have taken different paths to shipping indie hardware games over the pretty much

57
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,297
exact same time.

58
00:03:05,637 --> 00:03:12,541
Robyn started with LimeWobbler Game Jam around the same time that we started some funded R&D for what was then called Fabulous Beasts.

59
00:03:13,262 --> 00:03:16,224
We both showed prototypes here at GDC in March 2015.

60
00:03:17,224 --> 00:03:23,228
We both were selected as part of the IndieCade Festival in November 2015, both won prizes.

61
00:03:23,528 --> 00:03:27,070
You got design, right? And I got technology, which is exciting. Well, we got technology.

62
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,611
But then it diverges.

63
00:03:28,711 --> 00:03:37,636
So on my side, what we then did was aiming at mass manufacturing and retail and e-commerce

64
00:03:37,656 --> 00:03:38,536
and all those kind of things.

65
00:03:38,976 --> 00:03:40,897
So we raised investor money.

66
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:42,218
We raised revenue.

67
00:03:42,758 --> 00:03:49,767
We've tried to go through this whole process of Kickstarter, we've been manufacturing in China, and we're actually now shipping the game to retailers.

68
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:57,297
And that is a different route to the one that Robin is going to kick us off talking about, which I will now hand over to him and go and sit down.

69
00:03:58,518 --> 00:03:58,799
All right.

70
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:02,040
Yeah, so for me, it was much more like a linear progression.

71
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,720
So I kind of kept showing the game

72
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,341
and improving it over time.

73
00:04:05,361 --> 00:04:08,482
And I'm going to talk in detail about what kept breaking,

74
00:04:08,742 --> 00:04:10,903
what worked well, and what I learned from the progress.

75
00:04:11,283 --> 00:04:12,584
But before we dive into that, it's

76
00:04:12,604 --> 00:04:16,285
just a tiny little prelude about why you should all

77
00:04:16,325 --> 00:04:17,345
be making hardware games now.

78
00:04:18,046 --> 00:04:21,511
And yeah, especially if you hold the soldering iron wrong,

79
00:04:21,571 --> 00:04:22,573
it's going to be so hot.

80
00:04:23,894 --> 00:04:26,618
But yeah, in general, it's easier to use than ever.

81
00:04:26,739 --> 00:04:28,701
There's like little kits like Makey Makey

82
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:30,304
where I don't even need to do any programming.

83
00:04:30,324 --> 00:04:32,387
You just plug the cables into Banana

84
00:04:32,427 --> 00:04:34,269
and suddenly you have like a controller like that.

85
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,431
It's cheaper than ever.

86
00:04:35,831 --> 00:04:36,692
It's easier to buy.

87
00:04:36,712 --> 00:04:38,594
So you can buy it from China, even,

88
00:04:38,614 --> 00:04:40,376
even though it takes like two months to arrive,

89
00:04:41,497 --> 00:04:42,978
which I've done before a few times.

90
00:04:43,238 --> 00:04:44,740
And you forget about it, and you arrive,

91
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,502
and so a surprise arrives on your door.

92
00:04:46,742 --> 00:04:47,202
It's quite nice.

93
00:04:48,303 --> 00:04:49,304
The hardware gets getting better,

94
00:04:49,405 --> 00:04:51,086
so lots of devices get honed.

95
00:04:52,007 --> 00:04:54,990
So I am using like a type of Arduino.

96
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,251
It's called a Teensy, which is kind of...

97
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:58,833
Much better in every way, and I kind of rave about it

98
00:04:58,973 --> 00:04:59,994
every chance I get.

99
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:04,498
But there's also a lot of Kickstarter devices and all

100
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:06,339
kinds of different directions, connected devices.

101
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:08,681
And the community is getting better as well, both online

102
00:05:08,721 --> 00:05:09,201
and offline.

103
00:05:09,261 --> 00:05:11,683
So offline, there's a lot of hack spaces and maker spaces.

104
00:05:12,143 --> 00:05:15,626
So I almost exclusively work from the Hackspace London,

105
00:05:15,646 --> 00:05:17,627
which has lots of different tools.

106
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:20,309
But there's also a lot of online communities and forums

107
00:05:20,349 --> 00:05:24,012
that kind of help you with everything you need.

108
00:05:24,893 --> 00:05:29,557
So if you want to get started making these games, there's a few kind of events where you can do this.

109
00:05:30,057 --> 00:05:37,443
So there's, for example, there is the alt-ctrl game jam, which is kind of weird as far as hardware games jams go,

110
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:41,326
because you submit online, so nobody can actually play any of the games.

111
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:45,189
So it's a bit strange, but I mean, it's worldwide, so what else can you do?

112
00:05:46,149 --> 00:05:48,791
But there's, for example, then on the right, there's Zoo Machines Festival,

113
00:05:48,811 --> 00:05:50,872
which is a small, tiny festival in France.

114
00:05:51,353 --> 00:05:53,474
But everyone's making weird controllers there, and

115
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:56,716
it's a really nice event if you can make it over there.

116
00:05:57,476 --> 00:06:01,538
I made a game once there about knives, where knives spin on a motor, and

117
00:06:01,558 --> 00:06:02,659
you have to put your finger in.

118
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:04,320
It's very fun, very fun.

119
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:08,323
But also you can make your games at all kinds of game jams.

120
00:06:08,363 --> 00:06:16,009
So this was me three days ago soldering a weird kind of cat-finding game on the train

121
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:17,410
to San Francisco.

122
00:06:18,131 --> 00:06:19,232
So it's possible to do it on the train.

123
00:06:19,252 --> 00:06:21,653
You have to kind of make sure your tools are fairly small.

124
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:24,476
There's like a USB soldering iron, which I love.

125
00:06:25,316 --> 00:06:28,359
So it's definitely possible to make your games everywhere you like.

126
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:32,060
But yeah, now let's more specifically dive into

127
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,821
Line Wobbler, which is why I'm here.

128
00:06:33,841 --> 00:06:36,342
So I'm going to talk about what inspired me to make the

129
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:41,004
game, and then how I iterated it towards a proper art

130
00:06:41,064 --> 00:06:41,805
piece, in a way.

131
00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:48,776
So first the game was made at the Exile Game Jam, which is a small game jam in Denmark.

132
00:06:48,956 --> 00:06:50,697
And it's a very nice setting.

133
00:06:50,837 --> 00:06:54,158
And I made it to there, teamed up with Matthias Maschek.

134
00:06:55,299 --> 00:06:58,260
So we kind of together kind of brainstormed on different things.

135
00:06:58,641 --> 00:07:02,463
So I was looking at springs, and Matthias was looking at LED strips.

136
00:07:02,863 --> 00:07:07,925
And I got the idea to look at springs just before the jam by doing research online.

137
00:07:08,105 --> 00:07:11,727
And as you know, you look at cat videos when you do research online.

138
00:07:12,027 --> 00:07:16,053
So this is the actual literal inspiration for the controller of Line Wobbler.

139
00:07:19,915 --> 00:07:20,675
So this is a cat.

140
00:07:20,735 --> 00:07:22,456
Apparently, it's not my cat, unfortunately.

141
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:27,019
But fortunately, I guess, because it does that every morning at 5 o'clock,

142
00:07:27,059 --> 00:07:27,499
apparently.

143
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,841
But I thought, like, you know, the cat has so much fun.

144
00:07:30,902 --> 00:07:32,542
So I want to make a controller that has, like,

145
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,203
this kind of cool vibrating feedback.

146
00:07:34,904 --> 00:07:38,326
And so humans should enjoy this kind of interaction as well.

147
00:07:38,366 --> 00:07:43,689
So it took me a while to figure out how to measure the movement of the spring.

148
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,132
So at first I thought it could be bend sensors,

149
00:07:47,612 --> 00:07:49,814
or it could be like a little joystick on the base.

150
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,536
But finally arrived at accelerometers.

151
00:07:53,857 --> 00:07:58,221
And so I figured out how to kind of use the spring.

152
00:07:58,901 --> 00:08:03,385
And at the jam, Matthias was working with the LED strip.

153
00:08:03,645 --> 00:08:06,688
And so it was a very kind of mechanics-driven design process.

154
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:09,730
So mechanics in this case, I mean like literal mechanics,

155
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:14,014
like physical objects that kind of define what the game will be.

156
00:08:14,514 --> 00:08:20,137
So what we wanted to do is we want to build a game entirely based on these two objects only.

157
00:08:20,217 --> 00:08:24,420
So no buttons, nothing else, just the one-dimensional display and a spring.

158
00:08:26,401 --> 00:08:33,404
So this limitation to this simple interaction meant that we were quite limited in what we could do.

159
00:08:33,965 --> 00:08:36,406
So obviously you can bend a spring back and forth.

160
00:08:36,706 --> 00:08:39,608
So that kind of works just like a normal joystick in a way.

161
00:08:39,908 --> 00:08:41,849
But you also got this additional interaction of

162
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,410
kind of flinging the spring.

163
00:08:44,071 --> 00:08:46,632
So it's a new thing.

164
00:08:46,732 --> 00:08:50,995
And once we tested this, so we had a debug output on the LED

165
00:08:51,015 --> 00:08:52,916
strip, just like the spring position.

166
00:08:53,276 --> 00:08:55,417
And once we flung it back and forth, it's like, oh, this

167
00:08:55,437 --> 00:08:57,859
looks kind of violent, this movement.

168
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:00,560
So why don't we say this is an attack, and we add some

169
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,221
enemies to it?

170
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:05,184
So that kind of kick-started the idea for Line Warbler basically.

171
00:09:05,264 --> 00:09:10,128
It went from there, so it said, OK, if we can move along the spring, what else can there be?

172
00:09:10,168 --> 00:09:12,910
So there could be a timing challenge where you have to wait, and then you have to go,

173
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,331
and you get pushed in one direction.

174
00:09:16,352 --> 00:09:18,314
That is basically all the game is.

175
00:09:19,115 --> 00:09:22,978
So there's not much more to it, I mean, from a mechanics perspective.

176
00:09:23,718 --> 00:09:27,240
And yeah, so once I put these little accelerometers in here,

177
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,562
they're actually behind this, inside this little 3D printed knob here.

178
00:09:31,242 --> 00:09:33,623
And they work way better than expected.

179
00:09:33,663 --> 00:09:35,364
So the accuracy is much, much higher.

180
00:09:35,384 --> 00:09:37,785
I thought I could maybe detect if it's forward or backwards,

181
00:09:38,306 --> 00:09:40,187
but it's actually a very precise joystick.

182
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,548
So that allowed me to push up the skill ceiling

183
00:09:42,568 --> 00:09:44,969
by making the game much faster and thus a bit harder.

184
00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:46,970
So it's kind of a very difficult game,

185
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,592
but I can kind of make the levels easier to compensate.

186
00:09:52,220 --> 00:10:00,442
So over to the graphics. Because it's an LED strip, it's only one line of light, you don't really have much depth of information to convey to the player.

187
00:10:00,522 --> 00:10:05,503
So there's no sprites, there's no text, you know, there's barely any information besides color.

188
00:10:05,943 --> 00:10:12,545
And so I decided to stick to, we decided to stick to a very limited set of information we could convey.

189
00:10:12,585 --> 00:10:17,646
So it's very much like a traffic light in a way. So green is good, red is bad, and orange is somewhere in the middle.

190
00:10:18,006 --> 00:10:20,686
So that's kind of what we used. And that also kind of...

191
00:10:21,527 --> 00:10:24,010
prevents me in a way from kind of expanding the game

192
00:10:24,851 --> 00:10:26,813
to make it deeper because like now when I add

193
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,655
some teleporters or some pickups,

194
00:10:29,016 --> 00:10:30,097
then the question becomes, you know,

195
00:10:30,117 --> 00:10:32,019
what does this weird blue purple thing mean?

196
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:33,681
And that is not quite as obvious.

197
00:10:33,741 --> 00:10:36,344
And it might make sense as a kind of a hardcore mode

198
00:10:36,424 --> 00:10:37,665
or like an advanced mode where people

199
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:41,789
want to discover what they're doing, but I found like showing this game, because it is

200
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:44,111
so simple, also non-gamers play it.

201
00:10:44,191 --> 00:10:48,935
And surprisingly, or I don't know, for me surprisingly, they're not willing to explore.

202
00:10:49,055 --> 00:10:51,938
So when they see something they don't understand, they just stop.

203
00:10:52,598 --> 00:10:57,542
And so then, you know, you need to have some kind of way to convey what they're doing.

204
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:03,866
I actually was forced to cut this, well not forced, but like with this little short instruction

205
00:11:03,886 --> 00:11:08,728
sheet that you can kind of see on the screen there, that was necessary to have people understand,

206
00:11:09,048 --> 00:11:11,429
you know, oh this is lava, you shouldn't go there when it's bright.

207
00:11:11,449 --> 00:11:18,193
I mean you could, you know, as gamers we figure that out, but like normal players or people

208
00:11:18,213 --> 00:11:21,494
that are not as exposed to video games, they don't have this kind of...

209
00:11:23,195 --> 00:11:28,316
It's an interesting balance you need to find there.

210
00:11:30,577 --> 00:11:33,957
Also the LED strips are really cool because they're extremely bright.

211
00:11:34,397 --> 00:11:37,758
So whenever I work on them, I kind of see these little dots afterwards in my vision

212
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:39,458
for hours almost.

213
00:11:39,859 --> 00:11:44,400
So they're painfully bright, but I kind of decided to use that to my advantage to kind

214
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:44,480
of...

215
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,381
not quite torture the player, but kind of really,

216
00:11:48,381 --> 00:11:51,922
when things happen in the game, you kind of, you flash them a bit.

217
00:11:51,942 --> 00:11:53,503
So it reminded me a bit of asteroids.

218
00:11:53,523 --> 00:11:56,224
I don't know if any of you have played this in the vector graphics display.

219
00:11:56,244 --> 00:11:57,944
It was like, how bright this looked, and it was so cool.

220
00:11:57,964 --> 00:11:59,505
Wow, how can a TV look that bright?

221
00:11:59,905 --> 00:12:01,606
And so I kind of wanted to capture that feeling as well.

222
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:04,867
So all the main objects of the game have like full brightness, and

223
00:12:04,887 --> 00:12:08,308
then the rest of the game is kind of a very mellow color.

224
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:10,969
And also when you kill enemies,

225
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,311
I'm not going to show it now,

226
00:12:14,492 --> 00:12:16,293
then the entire screen flashes in full brightness,

227
00:12:16,313 --> 00:12:18,034
but it's very fast because the frame rate is so high,

228
00:12:18,054 --> 00:12:19,555
so it's almost subconscious.

229
00:12:20,135 --> 00:12:21,776
And this high frame rate also helped me

230
00:12:21,997 --> 00:12:24,398
to kind of make the game look really buttery smooth.

231
00:12:25,018 --> 00:12:28,701
and together with the low latency of this accelerometer,

232
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:31,803
I get a really immediate feedback of what the player is doing.

233
00:12:31,823 --> 00:12:36,106
And that, I think, helped also make the game feel so nice.

234
00:12:36,146 --> 00:12:38,307
Because I think in a lot of modern games,

235
00:12:38,727 --> 00:12:40,448
there's a trend to higher and higher latency,

236
00:12:40,789 --> 00:12:42,350
especially like mobile phones, when you tap it,

237
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,011
there's a built-in latency of, I think, 50 milliseconds at least.

238
00:12:45,472 --> 00:12:47,596
And it goes up with certain devices.

239
00:12:47,996 --> 00:12:50,560
So it's like this immediacy is going away.

240
00:12:50,821 --> 00:12:54,347
And I wanted to recapture that in this custom hardware game.

241
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:57,252
And I'm also looking into when I make more games, I want to

242
00:12:57,532 --> 00:12:59,375
keep this kind of snappy response there.

243
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:05,108
I also one more thing the the death effect it's like it's a one the

244
00:13:05,148 --> 00:13:07,990
particle fact I mean it's just like little things running on the screen

245
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,991
it's almost too beautiful to be a death animation so I thought

246
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,032
do players really understand that it just died or is it just

247
00:13:14,893 --> 00:13:18,634
pretty too pretty but everyone really comments immediately on like how nice it

248
00:13:18,654 --> 00:13:19,094
looks and it

249
00:13:19,415 --> 00:13:22,276
almost makes the players a bit suicidal because they just want to die all the time

250
00:13:22,856 --> 00:13:26,498
but yeah it was too pretty to change I had it in red for a while like blood

251
00:13:26,578 --> 00:13:27,858
but that doesn't quite work so it's

252
00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:33,426
It's, it might be doesn't kind of communicate so well, but it sticks with the players.

253
00:13:34,808 --> 00:13:39,155
And there's like subtle effects. For example, there's like a subtle dimming around the player.

254
00:13:39,175 --> 00:13:41,038
I don't know if I can show this now.

255
00:13:43,382 --> 00:13:47,164
It's very hard to see, but there's, you see there's like a gradient around the player

256
00:13:47,224 --> 00:13:50,706
where it gets darker, so it's just kind of to increase the contrast even more.

257
00:13:51,086 --> 00:13:55,549
And then there's like a shader running through the entire thing, if you want to call it a

258
00:13:55,589 --> 00:13:58,870
shader, but it kind of dims, or like kind of smooths out the entire movement.

259
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:02,992
So when you move really fast, you can kind of see a trail behind the player, even though

260
00:14:03,032 --> 00:14:05,253
it's only one pixel width at any time.

261
00:14:05,674 --> 00:14:07,495
So it just kind of fades it out where it was.

262
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,745
Yeah, so now that you have this game, how do you show it?

263
00:14:13,785 --> 00:14:19,071
So that's another nice aspect of this LED strip is that you can embed it into the real world,

264
00:14:19,131 --> 00:14:19,992
or you have to in a way.

265
00:14:20,312 --> 00:14:22,755
So again, the screen is always flat, and that's it.

266
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:27,721
But with an LED strip, you can kind of show it and arrange it according to the

267
00:14:28,642 --> 00:14:31,345
to the existing architecture of wherever you show it.

268
00:14:31,365 --> 00:14:33,907
So for example, at Mace in Berlin,

269
00:14:33,927 --> 00:14:35,349
where one of the first places I showed it,

270
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:37,371
had to go over the player's heads and even behind them.

271
00:14:37,792 --> 00:14:39,954
So everyone had to kind of crane their necks back

272
00:14:40,014 --> 00:14:42,637
and kind of almost painfully look at the game.

273
00:14:42,677 --> 00:14:43,958
And it was a nice eye-catcher,

274
00:14:43,978 --> 00:14:46,881
and I kind of like to annoy the player a little bit with that,

275
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:48,904
just kind of bring them out of their comfort zone.

276
00:14:51,206 --> 00:14:52,086
So here's another show.

277
00:14:52,146 --> 00:14:54,268
That was at the Zoo Machines Festival

278
00:14:54,288 --> 00:14:55,128
that I mentioned earlier.

279
00:14:55,548 --> 00:14:57,850
And they had some nice art piece there,

280
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,831
and I just arranged the LED strip inside it

281
00:15:00,772 --> 00:15:01,572
in a spiral there.

282
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:03,473
So that was good fun.

283
00:15:04,034 --> 00:15:05,334
Or you can kind of go all out

284
00:15:05,434 --> 00:15:07,116
and put the game, for example, underwater.

285
00:15:09,477 --> 00:15:15,040
So this was some background chatter at home from my parents.

286
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,722
They have a little pond and I put the LED strip underwater.

287
00:15:17,742 --> 00:15:21,884
It didn't really change the game at all, but it just kind of looked really cool.

288
00:15:22,465 --> 00:15:28,328
And I could well see having some weird wet sensors on the strip so you can have it go underwater.

289
00:15:28,588 --> 00:15:30,269
A little nude, enjoying the party.

290
00:15:30,289 --> 00:15:32,931
That's fun.

291
00:15:34,232 --> 00:15:36,153
But yeah, so you can show the game in different ways.

292
00:15:39,664 --> 00:15:42,685
So once you have the game and you start showing it, you

293
00:15:42,745 --> 00:15:45,226
immediately notice mistakes you made.

294
00:15:45,346 --> 00:15:48,127
And with normal video games, you have all these software

295
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,308
bugs you discover, usually at the worst kind of moment.

296
00:15:50,648 --> 00:15:53,009
But with hardware games, you also, on top of it, have

297
00:15:53,049 --> 00:15:53,570
hardware bugs.

298
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,091
And these are almost impossible to debug beforehand,

299
00:15:56,131 --> 00:15:57,931
because you just don't know what's going to break.

300
00:15:57,991 --> 00:16:00,873
Because you think, oh, I soldered this properly, but no,

301
00:16:00,913 --> 00:16:01,973
you didn't.

302
00:16:02,093 --> 00:16:03,334
Or this cable is strong enough.

303
00:16:03,354 --> 00:16:04,194
Of course it is not.

304
00:16:04,654 --> 00:16:07,695
And kids won't unplug this by mistake.

305
00:16:07,715 --> 00:16:08,476
They do it on purpose.

306
00:16:09,576 --> 00:16:10,417
So it's fun.

307
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:14,082
So this was, for example, an exhibition in Italy.

308
00:16:14,143 --> 00:16:16,546
So in Rome, I showed the game at the Maker Faire.

309
00:16:16,606 --> 00:16:17,828
And so I don't speak any Italian.

310
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:19,550
The kids don't speak any English.

311
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,273
So there was no way of communicating.

312
00:16:21,393 --> 00:16:24,537
And also, when kids play, they forget everything.

313
00:16:24,577 --> 00:16:25,078
They just kind of.

314
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,701
pushing each other out of the way, pulling on this thing as hard as they could.

315
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:31,982
So that was an ideal stress test for the game.

316
00:16:32,162 --> 00:16:36,883
And that kind of also revealed one of the biggest flaws at that time of the game.

317
00:16:37,203 --> 00:16:40,645
And I'm gonna go into detail of that, and that is the spring design.

318
00:16:41,405 --> 00:16:44,226
So initially, when I first made the game, and

319
00:16:44,246 --> 00:16:48,627
you saw it in the screenshot earlier maybe, I used these shoe tree springs.

320
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,728
I used for leather shoes to keep them in shape.

321
00:16:51,168 --> 00:16:52,789
These are actually my grandma's, so I kind of.

322
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:57,615
from her and re-appropriated them into a video game.

323
00:16:58,036 --> 00:17:02,042
And so these work fairly well, so they're kind of big and very springy, but they're

324
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:05,066
kind of awkward to mount to a table.

325
00:17:05,086 --> 00:17:08,411
So you can see the clamps over there, so you need to kind of make this weird wooden thing.

326
00:17:10,273 --> 00:17:15,415
So that didn't quite work and also getting more was a bit complicated and I just couldn't just steal all that stuff from my grandma.

327
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:16,595
It was not cool.

328
00:17:17,276 --> 00:17:23,018
So in the end I changed over to the doorstopper springs that was actually the original inspiration.

329
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:26,619
So these are much easier to use so they can come with the mounting holes.

330
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,740
They're smaller and much cheaper to use.

331
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,421
So you can actually see the accelerometer up there as well.

332
00:17:33,027 --> 00:17:36,030
But they have one main issue and they are not strong enough.

333
00:17:37,411 --> 00:17:40,375
So this is how it looks after kind of a couple, well,

334
00:17:40,395 --> 00:17:44,139
this is a couple months, that was in Berlin at the Game Science Center.

335
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,203
And so you can see the loops of the spring come loose.

336
00:17:48,683 --> 00:17:51,987
And so it's very difficult to use that way.

337
00:17:52,968 --> 00:17:56,269
So what I decided to do was make my own springs.

338
00:17:56,469 --> 00:18:01,312
And I luckily found a small-scale spring manufacturer in London.

339
00:18:02,512 --> 00:18:03,253
So I talked to them.

340
00:18:03,273 --> 00:18:05,634
They're called Small Order Springs and Fittings Limited.

341
00:18:06,134 --> 00:18:07,075
So it was kind of ideal.

342
00:18:07,115 --> 00:18:10,316
Not only do they do springs, but they also only do small orders of it.

343
00:18:10,396 --> 00:18:11,717
And I only wanted the small orders.

344
00:18:11,737 --> 00:18:14,439
So it's kind of weird what companies exist.

345
00:18:14,499 --> 00:18:15,239
But that was fine.

346
00:18:15,339 --> 00:18:18,301
It took me a while to convince them that I wanted to do that.

347
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:19,741
Oh, let me turn it down a bit.

348
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:25,204
So this is a machine that makes the springs.

349
00:18:26,585 --> 00:18:29,305
As you can see there's a base on the bottom.

350
00:18:29,946 --> 00:18:31,606
That's for attaching it to the base.

351
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:34,647
And then in the top it kind of gets a bit smaller, like there.

352
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:39,408
And that's where I attach the knob, the 3D printed top of the spring.

353
00:18:40,008 --> 00:18:40,688
And I cut it off.

354
00:18:41,877 --> 00:18:43,098
It's quite fascinating to watch.

355
00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:45,420
And yeah, so I made 50 of those.

356
00:18:45,881 --> 00:18:46,381
There they are.

357
00:18:48,543 --> 00:18:51,385
And so now I have 50 of those springs lying around.

358
00:18:52,066 --> 00:18:53,707
It's not too expensive to do it like that.

359
00:18:53,727 --> 00:18:55,769
So I think overall, this turned out

360
00:18:55,809 --> 00:18:59,952
to be like $5 per spring, which, considered the other cost,

361
00:18:59,992 --> 00:19:00,973
is not too much.

362
00:19:02,494 --> 00:19:05,316
And then on to manufacturing the other things.

363
00:19:05,776 --> 00:19:08,318
So there is laser cut boxes.

364
00:19:08,498 --> 00:19:09,699
These are super simple to make.

365
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:12,661
So you just use Inkscape or any vector drawing program.

366
00:19:12,741 --> 00:19:15,163
And there's even plugins that make these tabs for you.

367
00:19:15,663 --> 00:19:17,665
It's super fast to assemble those.

368
00:19:18,005 --> 00:19:20,026
There's 3D printing, of course.

369
00:19:20,206 --> 00:19:22,028
There's new and exciting materials.

370
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,069
You can't actually play a game with it.

371
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:24,630
It doesn't look like wood.

372
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:27,432
Some are flexible, and I used the flexible ones, so you can actually squeeze that in.

373
00:19:27,492 --> 00:19:31,076
I don't know if that's visible, so it's kind of much more comfortable to use.

374
00:19:32,116 --> 00:19:35,560
And also when you work in a Hackspace, so this was all taken in the Hackspace, you

375
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,143
get sometimes little playtesters like this one.

376
00:19:42,925 --> 00:19:45,267
So I want to really make a dedicated cat version of the game.

377
00:19:45,287 --> 00:19:49,610
So I want to rub some catnip into the controller, so then one cat controls it and the other

378
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,651
one runs after the LED.

379
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,193
So that would be the ideal game, I think.

380
00:19:53,213 --> 00:19:55,535
Ah, such a cute cat.

381
00:19:55,555 --> 00:19:57,016
Yeah.

382
00:19:57,036 --> 00:19:57,176
Yeah.

383
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:21,207
Right. Yeah, so it's just one more thing then of the manufacturing process. So I used to use like these breadboards as you know, like just plug everything in and to just make it easier for me to make more of them. I learned how to make PCBs. It's not too hard to do that. The software is free. It's a very archaic software. So you have to like use a combination of buttons and command line commands. But overall, it's not too bad.

384
00:20:23,407 --> 00:20:26,567
Here's the part list. It's not really important, just in case you're curious.

385
00:20:26,927 --> 00:20:29,948
So I'm using this Teensy, which is like an American version of an Arduino.

386
00:20:30,588 --> 00:20:35,049
It's just better and faster in most ways, but essentially it's an Arduino.

387
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:38,930
The Axorometer is just the cheapest one and the first one that was recommended,

388
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:43,471
so I just googled for Axorometer Arduino, and there was a full discussion.

389
00:20:43,491 --> 00:20:46,372
I'll use these ones, they're $3, and these are the pins you should use.

390
00:20:46,392 --> 00:20:49,012
Here's a library, and done. So that was super simple.

391
00:20:49,532 --> 00:20:52,594
And the LED strips, I think, are the most expensive part of the project.

392
00:20:52,634 --> 00:20:55,475
So there are individually addressable LED strips.

393
00:20:56,956 --> 00:21:00,457
For now, these rolls come to about $150, but

394
00:21:00,497 --> 00:21:03,919
it's also the highest density you can buy and the longest you can buy them.

395
00:21:03,939 --> 00:21:07,881
So if you want to have shorter or less good ones, it's way, way cheaper.

396
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:13,032
Yeah, so then the progression from this prototype I built

397
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,693
to installation art, or kind of, it's not,

398
00:21:16,373 --> 00:21:19,375
yeah, it's like a question of where do you show the game.

399
00:21:19,855 --> 00:21:22,416
So, and I started, and I guess like some of you here

400
00:21:22,516 --> 00:21:24,097
also started with, or will start with,

401
00:21:24,137 --> 00:21:26,038
the Alt Control GDC exhibition,

402
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:30,060
which is a really cool initiative now in its fourth year

403
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,760
by John Paulson here at GDC.

404
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,001
So, if you don't know about it,

405
00:21:33,021 --> 00:21:35,082
it's on from Wednesday in the Play area, I think.

406
00:21:35,702 --> 00:21:39,104
And they show like weird experimental games and all kind of all stages of

407
00:21:39,144 --> 00:21:43,186
development so like really simple little things to really complex like sewing

408
00:21:43,226 --> 00:21:44,587
machine controllers and all this

409
00:21:45,227 --> 00:21:48,649
weirdness. So that's super super nice and there's like a couple other ones you can

410
00:21:48,669 --> 00:21:52,851
go to and I've kind of written up this progression here so you start at these

411
00:21:53,911 --> 00:21:56,492
events that are really good for experimental games.

412
00:21:57,033 --> 00:22:01,115
For example, Out of Control, Amaze, Fantastic Arcade and then you go on to normal

413
00:22:01,435 --> 00:22:02,015
game shows.

414
00:22:03,376 --> 00:22:04,596
Tokyo Game Show was really fun.

415
00:22:06,037 --> 00:22:09,120
For me, and then you expand to more artsy events.

416
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:13,804
So for example, this was at the Cluj-Utronic Music Festival in Romania,

417
00:22:14,305 --> 00:22:16,586
which was very fun to go to.

418
00:22:16,647 --> 00:22:18,268
And it's like electronic music everywhere and

419
00:22:18,288 --> 00:22:20,210
then there's these light games that worked out really well.

420
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,912
And finally, you can show it at museums as well.

421
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:26,155
So game science centric museums or

422
00:22:26,195 --> 00:22:27,936
kids centric museums love to show that stuff.

423
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:32,361
Yeah, well you showed it like weird events like Burning Man.

424
00:22:32,902 --> 00:22:36,627
That was a very fun event to go to and it turns out people on

425
00:22:36,687 --> 00:22:38,510
acid really like blinking LEDs.

426
00:22:40,072 --> 00:22:40,673
Also I hear.

427
00:22:42,436 --> 00:22:45,340
So that was that was really cool and good stress test for

428
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,021
the hardware as well.

429
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:51,989
Making money from installation art is always tricky.

430
00:22:53,210 --> 00:23:00,073
For myself, my route with Leinmobler was to make this kind of piece for museums and festivals.

431
00:23:00,653 --> 00:23:03,294
So I rent them out now.

432
00:23:04,514 --> 00:23:06,876
I get often emails from curators,

433
00:23:06,936 --> 00:23:10,299
and I think they see them at these events I showed before.

434
00:23:10,879 --> 00:23:13,942
And it depends really on the size of the museum,

435
00:23:13,982 --> 00:23:18,085
but you can get around like $500 or more

436
00:23:18,705 --> 00:23:20,126
for showing it at a brief event.

437
00:23:20,527 --> 00:23:21,708
It depends really on the size,

438
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:24,710
so I don't really know if that's a good number or not.

439
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:25,971
It's just what I've been seeing.

440
00:23:26,591 --> 00:23:29,193
And it kind of sidestepped this durability issue a bit

441
00:23:29,213 --> 00:23:30,614
because it only rented out for one week.

442
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,698
But, you know, if I want to make limited editions,

443
00:23:34,278 --> 00:23:37,280
then that question will come up.

444
00:23:37,621 --> 00:23:38,401
What about warranty?

445
00:23:38,641 --> 00:23:39,462
What about durability?

446
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:42,404
What about, like, kind of electrical safety testing?

447
00:23:42,764 --> 00:23:43,585
And I haven't done any of this,

448
00:23:43,645 --> 00:23:45,486
so that's going to be a next big question.

449
00:23:45,566 --> 00:23:46,827
And also price will be a question,

450
00:23:46,847 --> 00:23:48,948
because these are all handmade now by me,

451
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:51,350
so the hardware is not that cheap,

452
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:55,452
so it'll be probably north of $1,000, $2,000 per copy,

453
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:58,394
which is definitely more than I would pay for a copy of this,

454
00:23:58,474 --> 00:23:59,675
especially because the game is so short.

455
00:24:01,261 --> 00:24:03,362
But yes, so almost done here with my part.

456
00:24:03,782 --> 00:24:07,304
So I've discovered, or I kind of identified

457
00:24:07,324 --> 00:24:10,606
like three main ways to kind of bring your game forward.

458
00:24:10,646 --> 00:24:11,767
So the small scale installation art

459
00:24:11,787 --> 00:24:13,628
is what I've been doing with Line Mobbler.

460
00:24:14,248 --> 00:24:17,330
You can also license it out to arcade companies,

461
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,271
to toy companies, different ones that always look

462
00:24:20,332 --> 00:24:23,893
for innovation and try to license your games.

463
00:24:23,994 --> 00:24:27,816
I have no idea how trustworthy or good these deals are,

464
00:24:27,856 --> 00:24:29,577
but then there's experts in those fields

465
00:24:29,637 --> 00:24:30,217
that can help you.

466
00:24:31,117 --> 00:24:33,879
Or you do the Kickstarter mass production approach,

467
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,859
and that's what Alex is going to talk to you about in a minute.

468
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,321
But just to wrap up my part, so what's next with Line Mobiler,

469
00:24:40,682 --> 00:24:43,183
I really want to build a massive version.

470
00:24:43,223 --> 00:24:45,584
So like really building size would be amazing.

471
00:24:45,624 --> 00:24:47,624
So this is the CN Tower in Toronto.

472
00:24:48,025 --> 00:24:49,525
And we actually started talking to those guys.

473
00:24:49,565 --> 00:24:53,487
So because they have an interactive LED thing on there,

474
00:24:53,627 --> 00:24:56,568
I think it's just screens, no, like normal lamps.

475
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:02,794
But it turns out their system is super archaic, so actually how they do it is they have one

476
00:25:02,854 --> 00:25:07,939
big PNG, like one picture, and they read it out line by line, once per second, and that's

477
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,781
what they put on the string.

478
00:25:09,861 --> 00:25:13,585
So I don't know if it's at all possible to have a faster update.

479
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:15,927
It's like a frame rate of one isn't that great.

480
00:25:17,709 --> 00:25:19,490
But yeah, so now I kind of play around with the games.

481
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:20,811
I want to make a multiplayer version,

482
00:25:20,911 --> 00:25:21,651
like an endless version,

483
00:25:21,671 --> 00:25:23,613
like a loop around the room, for example,

484
00:25:24,353 --> 00:25:25,714
or different games on the same hardware.

485
00:25:25,754 --> 00:25:27,595
But it's actually very limiting.

486
00:25:27,635 --> 00:25:30,217
So, I mean, Line Warper seems to have come together

487
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,778
by itself almost when we made it,

488
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:36,161
but thinking specifically of more games is very tricky.

489
00:25:36,221 --> 00:25:39,823
So I have to see if I come up with other cool, fun ideas.

490
00:25:41,264 --> 00:25:42,325
But yeah, so that's my part.

491
00:25:43,045 --> 00:25:44,166
So now I'll hand over to Alex.

492
00:25:44,686 --> 00:25:44,886
Yeah.

493
00:25:46,167 --> 00:25:46,347
Cheers.

494
00:25:55,945 --> 00:25:59,447
So, yeah, that was Line Mobbler. And I'm switching on my...

495
00:26:01,148 --> 00:26:05,831
Very good. Hardware. Really good with the, super good with the hardware.

496
00:26:06,851 --> 00:26:10,674
So, yeah, so Line Mobbler is one kind of way of doing it, and here is a different way.

497
00:26:10,774 --> 00:26:20,660
So, yeah, I am the founder of Sensible Object and kind of brought the idea for Beasts of Balance into the company.

498
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,381
I kind of started the company to make games like this,

499
00:26:25,061 --> 00:26:28,902
having, before this, run a studio called Hide and Seek.

500
00:26:29,203 --> 00:26:32,644
And Hide and Seek worked with some incredible game designers,

501
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:34,884
so people like Margaret Robertson and Holly Gramazio,

502
00:26:35,805 --> 00:26:37,565
to make a lot of games that intersected

503
00:26:38,005 --> 00:26:38,986
physical and digital.

504
00:26:39,086 --> 00:26:43,007
And one of those was this game called Blocks, which we

505
00:26:43,107 --> 00:26:46,548
created for the launch event of the PlayStation Move

506
00:26:46,568 --> 00:26:47,448
Controller in 2011.

507
00:26:48,849 --> 00:26:55,451
So Blocks was a game which combined stacking these slightly offset wobbly translucent cubes

508
00:26:56,212 --> 00:27:02,074
with this kind of spatial reasoning mechanic. Every time you added a block to the 2x2 tower,

509
00:27:02,415 --> 00:27:05,696
you had to match all of the adjacent faces, which were the PlayStation symbols.

510
00:27:05,736 --> 00:27:09,438
So if you put a sort of, you could always go up because you could go triangle to triangle,

511
00:27:09,738 --> 00:27:12,619
but if you wanted to put the fourth block in a row of four,

512
00:27:12,639 --> 00:27:15,400
you would have to match the two spaces there and the one below.

513
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:15,480
And...

514
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:22,523
It kind of just exploded in terms of the amount of fun that it generated.

515
00:27:22,543 --> 00:27:25,844
It was one of those games that we were like, wow, that was good.

516
00:27:27,224 --> 00:27:31,885
And I always think of the reason why it worked so well as having something to do with

517
00:27:32,325 --> 00:27:35,426
like these two different kind of cognitive flavors.

518
00:27:35,866 --> 00:27:38,487
So I could talk about it like the cheese and pineapple on a stick.

519
00:27:39,007 --> 00:27:45,089
of games. So on the one hand you have this chewy, savoury, spatial, resource-managing

520
00:27:45,169 --> 00:27:50,271
kind of game, and on the other you have this sweet, tangy, performative, stacking, dexterity

521
00:27:50,291 --> 00:27:54,093
game. And you put those two together and something about that was just super satisfying.

522
00:27:55,373 --> 00:28:00,434
I always wanted to make a quote-unquote digital version of the game, but in 2011 when we designed

523
00:28:00,454 --> 00:28:03,295
the game, the technology wasn't really there to support that.

524
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:08,696
We did have some conversations with PlayStation around a kind of screen-only move controller

525
00:28:08,716 --> 00:28:12,717
version, but I never really felt like that would do the idea justice, so it kind of got

526
00:28:13,137 --> 00:28:13,878
filed away.

527
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:18,699
So kind of fast forward to 2014.

528
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,962
2015, 2014-2015, when I was looking at what to do for this game.

529
00:28:27,863 --> 00:28:32,965
And as you can see, as a kind of game design and creative director,

530
00:28:33,025 --> 00:28:35,346
drawing is definitely not one of my strengths.

531
00:28:36,867 --> 00:28:40,909
But as a kind of illustration, you can see that the kind of key concepts

532
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,810
of what I was trying to think about were starting to be here.

533
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:45,271
So I had this whole kind of...

534
00:28:45,771 --> 00:28:52,133
idea that we would use computer vision to track the positioning of the objects and the alignments of the shapes on the objects to

535
00:28:52,153 --> 00:28:59,096
kind of integrate kind of match three style mechanics with the stacking game so that you would be trying to align different patterns and

536
00:28:59,276 --> 00:29:03,058
and score points and kind of have combos and bonuses as a result.

537
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:23,643
So because we started from a different place with Sensible Object, which was really to take kind of event games and the kind of thinking and creativity which I've been putting into event games, but try to kind of pack that down into a scalable product business, so something that could be sustainable, something that could potentially

538
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:28,167
You know, board games and tabletop games can be kind of popular for a pretty long time,

539
00:29:28,227 --> 00:29:31,450
and they can earn revenues and enable you to do more R&D to make more games.

540
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:35,314
And so a much more typical kind of game studio commercial model.

541
00:29:35,755 --> 00:29:42,061
I was thinking from the outset about what the kind of commercial thinking that went into this game would be.

542
00:29:42,522 --> 00:29:45,265
And it was trying to kind of overlay between three things.

543
00:29:46,726 --> 00:29:51,248
that I guess I'm super into, but also that I felt kind of had some kind of interesting alignment.

544
00:29:51,308 --> 00:29:54,650
So on the one hand was dexterity games, Jenga is of course the most popular,

545
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:58,752
but if you're into your German tabletop games, you'll know games like Bandu and Hamster Roller.

546
00:29:59,692 --> 00:30:04,935
Collectible card games, CCGs, so they bring sort of really valuable play experiences,

547
00:30:04,995 --> 00:30:09,937
but also there's kind of long-term models of like continuously updating and evolving a game.

548
00:30:10,557 --> 00:30:18,304
And then, you know, in 2013-14, when I was thinking a lot about this, you also had kind of an emerging array of hybrid games.

549
00:30:18,344 --> 00:30:24,050
So the first of those were the kind of toys-to-life games, which were doing super well and very commercially successful,

550
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:28,654
and clearly did something that players really loved.

551
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:32,097
They were these kind of physical collectible toys, and they were unlocking things in a video game.

552
00:30:32,577 --> 00:30:37,623
But for me, their kind of limit, or the thing that frustrated me about them having made event games for a pretty long time,

553
00:30:37,964 --> 00:30:41,688
was how little action there was in the real world, that you basically just had this toy,

554
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:44,612
and it was either on the platform or off the platform.

555
00:30:44,792 --> 00:30:49,497
So, trying to kind of merge those things together from a commercial standpoint.

556
00:30:51,379 --> 00:30:54,201
So that kind of first four month R&D period

557
00:30:54,301 --> 00:30:55,902
put together a kind of core product team

558
00:30:55,942 --> 00:30:57,323
which is still with the company today.

559
00:30:57,824 --> 00:31:00,105
So Tim Burrell-Saward on physical design,

560
00:31:00,165 --> 00:31:02,407
George Buckenham on digital game design and development,

561
00:31:02,467 --> 00:31:04,768
Lyle McCarthy on art direction,

562
00:31:05,589 --> 00:31:07,290
and Chris Shaw was our engineer.

563
00:31:08,411 --> 00:31:09,131
who is our engineer.

564
00:31:09,612 --> 00:31:12,353
And one of the things I think which kind of I bring

565
00:31:12,473 --> 00:31:14,775
or which I'm very like obsessive about

566
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:18,417
as a kind of creative director, CEO type of person,

567
00:31:18,938 --> 00:31:22,100
is how do you get teams with skill sets and cultures

568
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,141
from different disciplines to really work together?

569
00:31:24,621 --> 00:31:25,962
And having had lots of experience

570
00:31:25,982 --> 00:31:27,563
about how that can not go well,

571
00:31:27,984 --> 00:31:30,665
one of the biggest things is language and use of language

572
00:31:30,765 --> 00:31:32,987
and being able to translate and kind of understand

573
00:31:33,047 --> 00:31:35,228
across different domains and disciplines.

574
00:31:36,049 --> 00:31:40,391
I've been on many projects where two people were describing the same thing but thought

575
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:43,972
it meant something completely different and it wasn't until the night before demo day

576
00:31:44,032 --> 00:31:48,694
when it turned out there was some chasm in the way the project worked that was only discovered

577
00:31:48,734 --> 00:31:51,956
at kind of 6pm with 12 hours to go before we had to ship it out on a plane.

578
00:31:52,476 --> 00:31:55,277
that that kind of problem of language was kind of picked apart.

579
00:31:55,737 --> 00:31:58,698
So something that I picked up from my old

580
00:31:59,098 --> 00:32:03,200
colleague Margaret Robertson at Hide and Seek was this idea of a this we believe.

581
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,941
So a this we believe is a tool for collaborating across disciplines where

582
00:32:06,961 --> 00:32:07,401
you set this

583
00:32:07,602 --> 00:32:11,163
aspirational set of goals and we used it a whole bunch

584
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:15,344
and basically it's not a feature list, it's a kind of slightly pretentious set

585
00:32:15,384 --> 00:32:16,925
of goals that helps you kind of

586
00:32:17,225 --> 00:32:21,086
aspire to what you want to be. But it had some things in there that really helped us.

587
00:32:21,547 --> 00:32:28,534
So we took these two sentences and from those reached the conclusion that computer vision

588
00:32:28,594 --> 00:32:29,615
was a really bad idea.

589
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:35,701
That basically it was too risk to be kind of effective in all situations and too expensive

590
00:32:35,781 --> 00:32:37,242
to translate into a family game.

591
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:42,168
So our engineer Chris Shaw went away and kind of did a bunch of research,

592
00:32:42,308 --> 00:32:46,573
came back with a whole bunch of options about how we could like look at the tower or sense the tower,

593
00:32:47,033 --> 00:32:52,399
and the only one of those that really was effective in his view was putting a weighing scale underneath the tower.

594
00:32:53,365 --> 00:32:58,268
Now, the trouble with that was that it didn't, in his view, give anything like a good enough

595
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:00,048
image of what was going on in the tower.

596
00:33:00,108 --> 00:33:01,989
It wouldn't know things like proximity, for example.

597
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:06,711
But this is where that kind of interdisciplinary collaboration really comes off, because as

598
00:33:06,771 --> 00:33:10,693
designers, George and I were able to look at what that kind of one dumb number of how

599
00:33:10,733 --> 00:33:15,095
heavy the tower was gave us, and start to derive ideas of game mechanics that would

600
00:33:15,115 --> 00:33:15,595
really work.

601
00:33:15,976 --> 00:33:19,197
So the one that's probably most effective, which you had a little look at in the trailer,

602
00:33:19,557 --> 00:33:21,578
is when the player knocks over the tower.

603
00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:27,202
then basically the tower goes from the weight that it was at to zero or close to zero.

604
00:33:27,543 --> 00:33:32,386
If you can rebuild the tower before the volcano erupts, then you get to keep playing.

605
00:33:32,907 --> 00:33:36,009
So, it's quite kind of simple from a sort of sensing perspective.

606
00:33:36,029 --> 00:33:40,132
We're just looking, did the number get back to the number that it was before in the time available?

607
00:33:40,793 --> 00:33:44,256
But from a player perspective, it's an incredibly dynamic and exciting moment.

608
00:33:44,776 --> 00:33:49,219
Another advantage of dumb sensors, and I think we share some sort of thinking here,

609
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,523
is super low latency.

610
00:33:51,683 --> 00:33:54,668
So we're taking this one feed of data from a single sensor

611
00:33:55,029 --> 00:33:56,652
and we're doing some signal processing

612
00:33:56,692 --> 00:33:59,617
to kind of turn that into a game input.

613
00:33:59,777 --> 00:34:01,740
And that low latency gives a nice crisp,

614
00:34:02,141 --> 00:34:03,203
cheery effect in the game.

615
00:34:04,616 --> 00:34:09,317
So we also iterated through exhibition, kind of similar thing of taking it to expos and so on.

616
00:34:09,758 --> 00:34:15,419
Original prototype was this more geometric 3D printed abstract 2 player competitive game.

617
00:34:15,439 --> 00:34:19,841
It had a ton of pieces, had breeding and battling mechanics, had more regions.

618
00:34:20,781 --> 00:34:22,641
So we took that into playtests.

619
00:34:23,462 --> 00:34:28,243
It turns out that if you put a playtest up on Eventbrite in central London and you say free pizza,

620
00:34:28,603 --> 00:34:31,543
you will get literally anybody who will come to that event.

621
00:34:31,883 --> 00:34:34,884
And they will sometimes, quite often, not know why they are there.

622
00:34:35,544 --> 00:34:39,065
You'll say, so you're here for the pizza? Yeah, there's pizza, right?

623
00:34:40,205 --> 00:34:44,326
I should say, that's actually the design team from us too, so they did know why they were there.

624
00:34:44,506 --> 00:34:47,086
But actually, it turns out that's super useful because...

625
00:34:48,427 --> 00:34:54,430
Trying to communicate your weird indie hardware game to people who don't know what's up is very valuable.

626
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:59,872
We also did a whole bunch of exhibitions, and for us, what we were trying to do in those situations was,

627
00:35:00,092 --> 00:35:04,835
could we get the game to be readable and understandable by somebody in like 10 seconds?

628
00:35:05,635 --> 00:35:09,277
Because, you know, in that kind of environment, you're getting a lot of people coming through,

629
00:35:09,317 --> 00:35:11,478
and you're trying to get people hooked, and that's super important.

630
00:35:12,699 --> 00:35:19,005
What those two types of playtesting gave to us is that that first version we created was wrong in two ways.

631
00:35:19,585 --> 00:35:22,027
One, the core gameplay was far too complex.

632
00:35:23,068 --> 00:35:28,053
And the second was that we needed to switch from a competitive game to a cooperative game.

633
00:35:28,654 --> 00:35:32,177
So we were asking a lot, we do ask a lot of players when they come to our game.

634
00:35:32,197 --> 00:35:34,279
They have to absorb a new interaction model.

635
00:35:34,319 --> 00:35:37,702
There's like these pieces, there's this hardware, it's connecting to this world.

636
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:40,164
They don't match in a kind of completely obvious way.

637
00:35:40,765 --> 00:35:45,189
And the thing about a competitive game is that you are going to keep the information

638
00:35:45,229 --> 00:35:48,972
that you glean about the way the system works to yourself because it may give you an advantage.

639
00:35:49,373 --> 00:35:53,797
Whereas in a competitive game, you get to share that knowledge and it becomes a form

640
00:35:53,837 --> 00:35:54,617
of social currency.

641
00:35:55,178 --> 00:35:59,061
So actually, a lot of what George and I tried to accomplish

642
00:35:59,301 --> 00:36:04,044
with the design of the first hour of gameplay is not giving

643
00:36:04,064 --> 00:36:07,667
you too much tutorial, much like a mobile game would do

644
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:10,809
these days, but instead to give you a set of mechanics.

645
00:36:11,049 --> 00:36:13,831
And through scoring and different things, you can

646
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:18,295
discover that you can really enjoy figuring out and piecing

647
00:36:18,335 --> 00:36:19,155
together as a group.

648
00:36:20,277 --> 00:36:22,298
And that's been a very effective tool.

649
00:36:22,318 --> 00:36:26,319
We get a lot of people coming back to us saying that that experience of discovery is a really

650
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:28,120
big part of what they dig about the game.

651
00:36:29,361 --> 00:36:33,882
So conscious of time, so I'm going to kind of whip through all of this.

652
00:36:35,383 --> 00:36:37,023
We had a pretty big year last year.

653
00:36:37,924 --> 00:36:44,091
We successfully kick-started the game, we manufactured and shipped on time,

654
00:36:44,692 --> 00:36:51,180
we had coverage and sales all around the world, and we actually got into a whole bunch of fairly premium retailers,

655
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:56,246
none of which was stuff that we knew or thought we were going to do at the start of the year, so it was pretty exciting.

656
00:36:58,528 --> 00:37:01,251
And that kind of translates into some pretty cool numbers.

657
00:37:01,532 --> 00:37:03,294
So we manufactured about 13,000.

658
00:37:04,735 --> 00:37:07,919
We've sold through, so there are now kind of in people's homes, about 10,000 at $99.

659
00:37:07,979 --> 00:37:09,861
So that's, you know, like pretty good.

660
00:37:13,424 --> 00:37:21,392
We see that when people come to our e-commerce site, that that thinking we were putting in about collectible card games is starting to play out.

661
00:37:21,553 --> 00:37:25,817
So there are four different upgrades you can buy from beastsofbalance.com.

662
00:37:26,217 --> 00:37:31,142
Two of those add gameplay, and the ones that add gameplay are way more popular than the ones that do not.

663
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:36,606
And yeah, basically people are into this idea that this is a game that gets more fun the more pieces you buy.

664
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:39,888
And they're kind of doing it because they want to, not because they have to.

665
00:37:40,949 --> 00:37:41,929
It's being played a bunch.

666
00:37:42,249 --> 00:37:46,192
So we talked to tabletop game companies about this statistic that

667
00:37:47,352 --> 00:37:51,575
like 15 or 16 games a month is the average number of times our game is played.

668
00:37:51,995 --> 00:37:52,436
And they like A.

669
00:37:53,336 --> 00:37:59,341
don't know, obviously, because if you ship a plastic game to somebody, how would you know how many times it's played?

670
00:37:59,722 --> 00:38:02,284
And if they do know, they would not expect that number to be so high.

671
00:38:02,784 --> 00:38:05,627
So we're kind of moving into a sort of different territory

672
00:38:06,207 --> 00:38:11,932
with the industry as we kind of start to flow this data into our communications with people.

673
00:38:12,553 --> 00:38:18,395
So that's just a quick scamper through kind of the design history, a little look at some

674
00:38:18,415 --> 00:38:23,397
of the headlines, but I want to spend the kind of last piece of the talk just looking at like

675
00:38:23,617 --> 00:38:28,879
what this means for you and what this means for people who want to enter this exciting world.

676
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,041
So I think you know like we're doing this in different ways,

677
00:38:32,701 --> 00:38:35,322
but really what I would say like because I'm an old person.

678
00:38:36,443 --> 00:38:44,332
I remember in 2005, 2006, just as indie games as a concept were really starting to migrate

679
00:38:44,352 --> 00:38:49,958
into the mainstream, that two things that were driving it were, it was easier to publish

680
00:38:49,978 --> 00:38:53,502
games and it cost less to make them, and that's what made it possible for everyone to do that.

681
00:38:55,004 --> 00:38:58,606
Robin and I are both doing is finding that is now true,

682
00:38:59,006 --> 00:39:01,968
but also with hardware and electronics and retail.

683
00:39:02,868 --> 00:39:05,530
And that's exciting because it means that what we've done,

684
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,670
you guys can do too.

685
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:09,712
And I just want to kind of quickly look at the stacks.

686
00:39:09,852 --> 00:39:11,113
There are these four kind of stacks

687
00:39:11,133 --> 00:39:12,854
that we think about as we kind of rest on.

688
00:39:13,234 --> 00:39:16,416
And some of these things will be super familiar to you,

689
00:39:16,876 --> 00:39:19,257
like Unity, everyone's probably using that.

690
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:25,202
But then that's integrated with the kind of Arduino and 3D printing technologies that

691
00:39:25,242 --> 00:39:28,344
we both use to kind of help make our prototypes.

692
00:39:29,965 --> 00:39:33,969
We also kind of see makerspaces as incredibly important to what drives this.

693
00:39:34,029 --> 00:39:35,210
There's probably a makerspace.

694
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:38,672
If you're making hardware, you're probably in or near a makerspace, the whole bunch.

695
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,454
And it's not just...

696
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:46,076
The resources, although those are important, this is an early 3D printed version of a prototype.

697
00:39:46,556 --> 00:39:51,497
You definitely do not want to be trying to 3D print that many pieces by yourself, because

698
00:39:51,657 --> 00:39:54,458
each one of those things takes like 24 hours and it's a complete pain.

699
00:39:56,078 --> 00:39:58,739
If it works at all, which of course is the joy of 3D printing.

700
00:39:59,279 --> 00:40:03,021
But more the community that we have access to.

701
00:40:03,261 --> 00:40:06,322
So just in our one makerspace in central London.

702
00:40:07,042 --> 00:40:10,524
There are four or five different companies that have kick-started in the last six months

703
00:40:10,644 --> 00:40:14,307
and between them raised well over a million pounds in kick-start revenue.

704
00:40:14,347 --> 00:40:19,790
So everyone is sharing ideas, information, mailing lists, all of this stuff.

705
00:40:19,931 --> 00:40:24,233
And emotional support, like everyone knows, if it's day 27 of your kick-starter,

706
00:40:24,253 --> 00:40:28,136
that you're in a very particular emotional place and you need shoulder rubs and pizza

707
00:40:28,376 --> 00:40:31,658
and just kind of pushing through the last few days of your campaign.

708
00:40:32,219 --> 00:40:34,821
And yeah, find those communities because they're incredible.

709
00:40:36,764 --> 00:40:38,285
So then there's your supply chain.

710
00:40:38,385 --> 00:40:42,666
So what we did is we went out to China and we found Chinese manufacturing partners.

711
00:40:43,027 --> 00:40:44,387
We did not try to do that alone.

712
00:40:44,767 --> 00:40:47,988
There are lots and lots of different knowledge networks that you can tap into

713
00:40:48,288 --> 00:40:51,409
that are going to help you find the right manufacturing partner in China.

714
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,490
That partner exists for everybody,

715
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:57,271
but there are very, very, very, very many different ways of getting it done.

716
00:40:57,752 --> 00:41:00,033
So we found a sourcing company that actually sort of

717
00:41:00,413 --> 00:41:02,734
transacts with and manages our supply chain,

718
00:41:03,135 --> 00:41:04,996
and we found them through Hardware Club,

719
00:41:05,016 --> 00:41:07,277
which is a members-only community of startups

720
00:41:07,297 --> 00:41:08,718
who are doing hardware all around the world.

721
00:41:09,438 --> 00:41:12,442
You then need to deal with getting it from the factory to people.

722
00:41:12,862 --> 00:41:16,567
So there are a whole bunch of third-party logistics companies that you can use.

723
00:41:16,967 --> 00:41:21,392
We're currently using Shipwire, which is really great for e-commerce and Kickstarter,

724
00:41:21,452 --> 00:41:23,315
not so great for shipping into retail.

725
00:41:23,735 --> 00:41:25,157
And then you need to deal with customer service,

726
00:41:25,217 --> 00:41:29,102
but then you can use something like Zendesk to help you automate and manage that process.

727
00:41:30,756 --> 00:41:33,398
We talked a bit already about launch in e-commerce through Kickstarter.

728
00:41:33,438 --> 00:41:37,721
It's incredibly important for revenues and also for kind of awareness and marketing.

729
00:41:38,741 --> 00:41:42,284
If you successfully kickstart your project, you have a good chance of getting onto Amazon

730
00:41:42,324 --> 00:41:48,407
Launchpad, which is a kind of startups-only program where you get a whole bunch of free

731
00:41:48,467 --> 00:41:51,689
additional services delivered to you by Amazon that you would normally have to pay a bunch

732
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:56,072
of money for, like putting that video that is on our Amazon product page.

733
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:59,114
Normally, you have to pay thousands of dollars for that, and we get it for free.

734
00:42:00,963 --> 00:42:09,793
And finally, the stuff that I don't need to tell you guys about, because if you're an indie game developer, you're already doing this really well, MailChimp, you know, all of these different sort of promotional tools that you've already got.

735
00:42:10,333 --> 00:42:17,161
And one thing I would say is, I think Robin and I both found this, that if you have a really weird, interesting indie hardware game,

736
00:42:17,581 --> 00:42:19,902
you have a much better chance of getting good coverage

737
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:21,143
because it's so different.

738
00:42:21,383 --> 00:42:25,445
And, you know, we haven't yet paid any YouTube content creators

739
00:42:25,485 --> 00:42:27,546
for any of the coverage that we've had to date.

740
00:42:27,946 --> 00:42:29,627
And I think that's largely a function of,

741
00:42:30,087 --> 00:42:30,988
they look at it, they think,

742
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,448
that is sufficiently weird and interesting

743
00:42:32,488 --> 00:42:33,329
that I just want to try it.

744
00:42:33,389 --> 00:42:34,129
And if I'm going to try it,

745
00:42:34,189 --> 00:42:35,930
I may as well make a video out of it.

746
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:37,651
And that makes a big difference

747
00:42:37,671 --> 00:42:38,731
when you're trying to get started.

748
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:45,542
So, super quickly, Kickstarter, a ton of things we got right,

749
00:42:45,962 --> 00:42:47,522
obviously a whole bunch of things we got wrong,

750
00:42:48,602 --> 00:42:50,303
so many things I could say about Kickstarter,

751
00:42:50,323 --> 00:42:52,363
but here's my one big takeaway for you all.

752
00:42:52,863 --> 00:42:55,184
Your pricing is more important than your marketing.

753
00:42:55,924 --> 00:42:57,744
Our early bird pricing jumped by $10,

754
00:42:57,884 --> 00:43:01,905
and it was after we'd raised about a third of our target,

755
00:43:02,506 --> 00:43:05,886
and basically the person 501 who came to our site

756
00:43:06,046 --> 00:43:07,467
had to pay $10 more than person 500,

757
00:43:07,767 --> 00:43:09,647
and that just pissed people off.

758
00:43:10,228 --> 00:43:15,452
So they didn't, and our numbers dropped really badly in a kind of scary way.

759
00:43:15,552 --> 00:43:20,035
So, like, there's a ton of knowledge out there about how to do physical Kickstarters right.

760
00:43:20,075 --> 00:43:23,278
Look at the board game community, especially a guy called Jamie Stegmeyer,

761
00:43:23,618 --> 00:43:29,242
who's super expert in kind of, and has shared very kind of much information on that.

762
00:43:31,018 --> 00:43:36,022
Okay, so one more thing for us about how manufacturing works and how profitability works.

763
00:43:36,582 --> 00:43:40,265
So it's a very different world if you're coming from indie software to indie hardware.

764
00:43:40,665 --> 00:43:42,947
You're used to Apple or Steam taking kind of 30%.

765
00:43:43,007 --> 00:43:47,691
There's a whole bunch of different people who are going to take money from you in a

766
00:43:47,771 --> 00:43:49,092
whole bunch of different ways.

767
00:43:50,453 --> 00:43:53,315
And you kind of have to be alert to what all of these mean.

768
00:43:54,075 --> 00:44:01,058
So, when you're thinking about that $99 that our game costs if you go buy it in Marbles

769
00:44:01,098 --> 00:44:05,239
the Brain store around the corner, firstly the retailers are going to take a chunk.

770
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,381
And that chunk varies massively depending on what channel.

771
00:44:08,561 --> 00:44:10,741
So if you're on Kickstarter, they're going to take about 5%.

772
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:17,104
If you're like a startup doing a deal with a niche retailer who's going to help you

773
00:44:17,124 --> 00:44:18,764
launch your product, they might take as much as 60%.

774
00:44:20,401 --> 00:44:24,554
Um, that channel also varies depending on which, um...

775
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:26,756
category you're in.

776
00:44:27,156 --> 00:44:29,277
So if you're in what's kind of STEM and electronics,

777
00:44:29,657 --> 00:44:31,658
they're much more used even in big department stores

778
00:44:31,678 --> 00:44:33,219
to thinking about 20 to 30%.

779
00:44:33,999 --> 00:44:35,440
But if you're in toys and games,

780
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,461
then they're used to cards against humanity type products

781
00:44:38,521 --> 00:44:40,342
where it doesn't cost them hardly anything to make

782
00:44:40,682 --> 00:44:42,943
and you can take a much, much bigger slice of the pie

783
00:44:42,983 --> 00:44:43,743
if you're the retailer.

784
00:44:44,123 --> 00:44:45,884
So actually like figuring out where your product

785
00:44:45,924 --> 00:44:48,945
is gonna sit in retail and knowing how the kind of margin

786
00:44:48,985 --> 00:44:50,005
and buying structure works

787
00:44:50,065 --> 00:44:51,226
is actually a really important thing.

788
00:44:52,036 --> 00:44:53,756
So on the other side of it, you have your COGS,

789
00:44:53,856 --> 00:44:55,177
or cost of goods sold.

790
00:44:55,537 --> 00:44:57,177
So that's basically everything that it costs

791
00:44:57,217 --> 00:44:58,637
to make one copy of the game,

792
00:44:58,998 --> 00:45:00,838
plus everything it costs to get to a warehouse

793
00:45:01,278 --> 00:45:02,658
in the country where you're gonna be selling it.

794
00:45:03,098 --> 00:45:04,959
So also kind of container shipping,

795
00:45:05,379 --> 00:45:08,120
import charges, other crap.

796
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:10,840
And then if you're kind of,

797
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:13,341
there's the actually warehouse to retailer

798
00:45:13,361 --> 00:45:14,921
or warehouse to customer kind of bit,

799
00:45:14,961 --> 00:45:15,361
which is another 5%.

800
00:45:15,821 --> 00:45:18,802
The mathematically savvy of you will have noticed

801
00:45:18,842 --> 00:45:20,402
that if you add up all of those costs,

802
00:45:20,422 --> 00:45:21,683
you can end up making no money.

803
00:45:22,644 --> 00:45:24,066
on your own retail product.

804
00:45:24,087 --> 00:45:25,930
And that is possible, really possible.

805
00:45:26,471 --> 00:45:28,574
And you can underestimate these things very easily.

806
00:45:29,035 --> 00:45:32,301
So, like, we knew pretty much.

807
00:45:33,443 --> 00:45:36,385
where we thought we were going to end up before we did our Kickstarter campaign,

808
00:45:36,405 --> 00:45:39,707
and we kind of planned all of our sort of pricing and everything around that.

809
00:45:40,167 --> 00:45:44,610
Because if you don't, you can end up with all sorts of troubles down the line.

810
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:47,812
So you have to be very, very kind of thoughtful ahead of time about this.

811
00:45:47,832 --> 00:45:50,954
You're going to have to work with those manufacturing partners.

812
00:45:50,974 --> 00:45:53,075
You're not going to be able to get to this number on your own.

813
00:45:53,095 --> 00:45:55,356
You're going to have to talk to people in China who are going to have to...

814
00:45:55,777 --> 00:45:59,298
It helps decide what components you're going to use, all of these sorts of things.

815
00:45:59,818 --> 00:46:05,301
To give you a quick example of how that looks, like in the sharp end of design, this is our

816
00:46:05,561 --> 00:46:10,103
engineer Chris Shaw's patented custom in-house frictional coefficient bug fixing test.

817
00:46:11,323 --> 00:46:16,125
Yep, it's an angle and a bit of plastic, and down to the right you can see a shiny

818
00:46:16,145 --> 00:46:17,386
bit of plastic that has fallen off.

819
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:21,161
So, if you've got a stacking game,

820
00:46:21,541 --> 00:46:23,421
one of the most important things about a stacking game

821
00:46:23,441 --> 00:46:24,502
is that your pieces can stack.

822
00:46:25,722 --> 00:46:28,623
Our 3D printed prototypes and our epoxy resin

823
00:46:28,743 --> 00:46:31,043
kind of next kinds of prototypes

824
00:46:31,363 --> 00:46:33,224
had a very sticky kind of finish,

825
00:46:33,324 --> 00:46:35,084
either through paint or through the kinds of materials

826
00:46:35,104 --> 00:46:35,584
that we were using.

827
00:46:35,964 --> 00:46:37,645
And that meant that when you kind of built a tower out of them,

828
00:46:37,685 --> 00:46:39,305
even if that tower was slightly janky,

829
00:46:39,565 --> 00:46:41,426
they would all kind of just hold in place.

830
00:46:42,206 --> 00:46:43,806
And that was really good,

831
00:46:44,006 --> 00:46:45,767
because it meant that you would sometimes stack a piece

832
00:46:45,787 --> 00:46:47,007
and be convinced that it would fall off,

833
00:46:47,027 --> 00:46:48,307
when it didn't and you felt good.

834
00:46:49,047 --> 00:46:54,570
With the pure ABS, so these are the first shots that came out of our injection molding tool.

835
00:46:55,050 --> 00:47:00,032
They were slippy as hell. There was nothing. If they weren't exactly parallel all the way up,

836
00:47:00,573 --> 00:47:04,714
the tower would just kind of explode without warning, which is not good.

837
00:47:05,915 --> 00:47:09,958
So instead, what we did was look for different solutions to that.

838
00:47:10,218 --> 00:47:12,060
There were two different ways we could solve the problem.

839
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,001
The way that we thought we were going to solve the problem

840
00:47:14,442 --> 00:47:16,203
is by etching the molding tool.

841
00:47:16,283 --> 00:47:19,646
So this is basically a process where you apply some kind of texture

842
00:47:20,066 --> 00:47:21,327
to the stainless steel tool,

843
00:47:21,647 --> 00:47:24,369
so that when you shoot the plastic into it, that texture kind of gets on.

844
00:47:24,389 --> 00:47:28,633
So if you think about like a walnut veneer dashboard in a car or something like that,

845
00:47:28,653 --> 00:47:29,513
it has that kind of texture.

846
00:47:29,954 --> 00:47:31,074
That actually made it worse,

847
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:34,157
because there was actually less...

848
00:47:34,757 --> 00:47:36,139
kind of contact area between the two.

849
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:37,840
So we thought, if they're rougher, it'll work.

850
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:38,501
But actually, what happened?

851
00:47:38,521 --> 00:47:40,222
They just bounced off each other even more.

852
00:47:40,823 --> 00:47:43,606
So then we had to go to plan C, which was the thing we

853
00:47:43,666 --> 00:47:45,768
really didn't want to have to do, which was this.

854
00:47:48,288 --> 00:47:55,296
So this is a rubberized spray coating which gets sprayed onto all of our hero pieces.

855
00:47:55,336 --> 00:48:00,060
It doesn't get sprayed onto all of the pieces, but so it gives it this lovely tactile kind

856
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:04,545
of premium feel and it also makes that kind of stackability really work.

857
00:48:05,566 --> 00:48:08,108
This added about 10 percent.

858
00:48:08,909 --> 00:48:13,351
to the overall cost of our product, which is bad.

859
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:20,934
And where we were was basically, like, this is what game design looks like if you're manufacturing.

860
00:48:21,374 --> 00:48:26,517
There is this dance happening between your product team, which is one place, your manufacturing

861
00:48:26,557 --> 00:48:28,417
team and your sourcing team, which is another place.

862
00:48:28,878 --> 00:48:30,718
You're having a ton of Skype conversations.

863
00:48:30,819 --> 00:48:33,700
You're FedExing prototypes backwards and forwards.

864
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:35,040
You're making videos.

865
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,581
You're kind of doing the, you're just figuring out how to test stuff.

866
00:48:37,982 --> 00:48:42,483
and you're trying to relate all of that back to a kind of creator's idea about what you

867
00:48:42,523 --> 00:48:45,884
want your experience to be when somebody gets this and unpacks it.

868
00:48:46,584 --> 00:48:49,905
In our case, we were also having that conversation with investors because we were also saying,

869
00:48:50,325 --> 00:48:52,046
yeah, so all of our estimates were off.

870
00:48:52,766 --> 00:48:55,907
Actually, we kind of allowed for a margin of error, but our margin of error wasn't enough,

871
00:48:56,147 --> 00:49:00,048
so we were kind of actually only about 5% over, but that was still bad.

872
00:49:01,629 --> 00:49:04,170
Now that is my idea of fun.

873
00:49:07,392 --> 00:49:13,336
So I would not recommend it if that sounds like stressful, but the dance, the relationship

874
00:49:13,496 --> 00:49:17,299
between this supply chain and all of these incredible people, like I've met so many

875
00:49:17,339 --> 00:49:23,103
amazing makers in China, and the kind of skill and the insight and the experience that they

876
00:49:23,143 --> 00:49:28,086
brought to this process was really a kind of humbling thing to interact with.

877
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:30,928
And we got it, and it worked.

878
00:49:30,948 --> 00:49:31,469
So basically...

879
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:37,973
The end of that story is you have to take the hit on your margin because there's no

880
00:49:38,013 --> 00:49:39,637
point in shipping a product that people don't enjoy.

881
00:49:40,568 --> 00:49:40,708
Right?

882
00:49:40,908 --> 00:49:45,413
You know, and ultimately there are a bunch of ways you might be able to solve that problem

883
00:49:45,473 --> 00:49:46,193
down the line.

884
00:49:47,054 --> 00:49:50,838
For example, changing from ABS to PVC is our kind of underlying material.

885
00:49:51,619 --> 00:49:55,903
But we can only do that if we've generated enough commercial interest to redo the tooling

886
00:49:55,943 --> 00:49:58,065
and all these kinds of, all these sort of nested things.

887
00:49:58,145 --> 00:50:02,129
But it's possible, but what you can't do is ever get back from, this product sucks,

888
00:50:02,149 --> 00:50:03,610
you can't stack the pieces, it's no fun.

889
00:50:03,891 --> 00:50:05,332
So that's where we ended up.

890
00:50:07,031 --> 00:50:13,813
So what we were surprised by was that Kickstarter drove interest not just from consumers, but

891
00:50:13,853 --> 00:50:15,753
also from commercial partners like retailers.

892
00:50:16,253 --> 00:50:21,314
So we had a bunch of emails pretty early in the campaign saying, you know, this is really

893
00:50:21,534 --> 00:50:24,075
cool, we want to stock it, will you come and show us a prototype?

894
00:50:24,475 --> 00:50:27,216
And those translated into purchase orders that meant we could

895
00:50:27,936 --> 00:50:31,317
basically triple the amount that we made in that first run.

896
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:34,678
So cash flow and financing is another thing

897
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,139
that you have to kind of get into.

898
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:39,860
It's hard, but not impossible to do that

899
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,461
if you have a purchase order from a reputable retailer.

900
00:50:43,181 --> 00:50:44,542
What you can't do is go to a bank and say,

901
00:50:44,622 --> 00:50:46,643
hey, this new product that we've never made before,

902
00:50:46,663 --> 00:50:47,323
I reckon I can sell 10,000.

903
00:50:47,943 --> 00:50:48,923
Will you give me some money, please?

904
00:50:49,424 --> 00:50:50,004
I did try that.

905
00:50:50,164 --> 00:50:50,664
It doesn't work.

906
00:50:50,804 --> 00:50:51,925
And we're just like, no.

907
00:50:53,746 --> 00:50:54,746
So that was the great thing.

908
00:50:54,866 --> 00:50:58,409
So Marbles, also a brilliant company in lots of ways,

909
00:50:58,769 --> 00:51:00,330
gave us all of this great in-store presence.

910
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:02,692
All of that work we'd done taking the game

911
00:51:02,732 --> 00:51:03,933
to exhibitions and festivals,

912
00:51:03,973 --> 00:51:05,334
so it turned out to be super useful

913
00:51:05,394 --> 00:51:08,155
in boiling down what the demo experience was in retail.

914
00:51:08,516 --> 00:51:10,597
So it turns out there to be a very close analog

915
00:51:10,657 --> 00:51:13,339
between what happens when you walk into a specialist retail

916
00:51:13,379 --> 00:51:15,400
in terms of how they get into and understand your game

917
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:16,521
and what happens at a conference.

918
00:51:17,433 --> 00:51:23,195
The bad part was that you need to be aware that if you're working with small scale retailers like Marbles,

919
00:51:24,155 --> 00:51:26,155
the fortunes of those companies can go down as well as up.

920
00:51:26,395 --> 00:51:30,877
They went bankrupt a couple of weeks ago and we're currently in the middle of a whole bunch of bankruptcy court stuff with them.

921
00:51:31,357 --> 00:51:36,078
So another good reason for working with Amazon as a partner is, I am pretty sure, don't quote me,

922
00:51:36,098 --> 00:51:39,879
but I'm pretty sure that Amazon is not going to go bust any time soon.

923
00:51:39,899 --> 00:51:43,019
So I super recommend working with those guys for that reason.

924
00:51:45,061 --> 00:51:47,966
If you get to this point that we've got to, so where we've now sold the game,

925
00:51:47,986 --> 00:51:51,471
we're doing more deals with retailers, we've just come back from the New York Toy Fair,

926
00:51:51,511 --> 00:51:55,578
it's all super exciting, you're then going to kind of come up against an interesting thing

927
00:51:55,618 --> 00:51:58,502
which is different between digital indie and physical indie.

928
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:04,192
This is a quote from a CEO of a similar company.

929
00:52:04,232 --> 00:52:06,093
She's about three years ahead of where we are.

930
00:52:06,774 --> 00:52:08,715
So she's my kind of go-to person for wisdom.

931
00:52:09,475 --> 00:52:11,857
And this was really challenging when she said this to me.

932
00:52:12,577 --> 00:52:14,698
If you didn't write another line of code

933
00:52:14,738 --> 00:52:16,079
or design another piece this year,

934
00:52:16,339 --> 00:52:17,200
you'd have a better year.

935
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,621
And what that is, is actually just a challenge saying,

936
00:52:19,922 --> 00:52:21,182
right now we're a making company.

937
00:52:21,403 --> 00:52:22,903
And we had to be a pretty good making company

938
00:52:22,923 --> 00:52:24,104
to get through this process.

939
00:52:24,144 --> 00:52:25,645
We had to be obsessive about the product.

940
00:52:26,065 --> 00:52:26,446
This year,

941
00:52:27,066 --> 00:52:28,667
We could just be a selling company.

942
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:30,749
We could just concentrate on our retail deals

943
00:52:30,789 --> 00:52:32,971
and our e-commerce channels and growth marketing

944
00:52:33,031 --> 00:52:34,872
and getting our Facebook ads better

945
00:52:35,293 --> 00:52:37,174
and doing better automated email

946
00:52:37,294 --> 00:52:39,236
and building the brand and doing ads

947
00:52:39,336 --> 00:52:40,317
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

948
00:52:40,337 --> 00:52:41,338
All, you know, like a million stuff.

949
00:52:41,818 --> 00:52:44,380
Now, that isn't, like, natively what we're into,

950
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:45,281
but she's right.

951
00:52:45,561 --> 00:52:47,123
We would have a better year if we did that.

952
00:52:47,663 --> 00:52:49,904
But we're not going to do that, because we like making games!

953
00:52:51,685 --> 00:52:55,887
So this is a little sneaky peek at what's coming up next for our game.

954
00:52:56,287 --> 00:52:59,849
So anyone who's played the game will know that that co-op game is where we are right now.

955
00:53:00,589 --> 00:53:03,070
We are going to be shipping a competitive game mode,

956
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:06,552
hopefully later this year, timing slightly TBC.

957
00:53:06,992 --> 00:53:08,993
It's going to come with a whole bunch of new pieces

958
00:53:09,053 --> 00:53:11,194
that are going to completely change what that game is all about.

959
00:53:11,914 --> 00:53:17,599
And it's also going to ship as a free app update to everyone who already has the game.

960
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:24,584
And this is where you start to get into some fun blending of the kind of digital game model and the physical game model.

961
00:53:24,985 --> 00:53:29,348
So we're used to cool new features being a reason that draws us back to digital games, right?

962
00:53:29,388 --> 00:53:31,830
And we can do that. We can just ship an app update that means,

963
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:36,093
hey, person who bought our game, you now have a completely new experience and that's free.

964
00:53:36,173 --> 00:53:37,775
Thank you for getting into our game.

965
00:53:38,309 --> 00:53:42,091
We can hopefully then convert some of those people to buying the physical upgrade,

966
00:53:42,131 --> 00:53:45,532
which is if you like that, then there's all of this extra cool stuff that you could be doing too.

967
00:53:46,272 --> 00:53:50,834
And then hopefully that gives us some more capital to work with to keep making cool games.

968
00:53:51,375 --> 00:53:53,055
And I think this is like, you know...

969
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:59,751
Not many companies get to play around with these kinds of things.

970
00:53:59,811 --> 00:54:02,132
And it's really exciting to just be trying this stuff.

971
00:54:02,552 --> 00:54:04,233
We don't exactly know how it's going to work,

972
00:54:04,553 --> 00:54:07,014
but we feel pretty good about making it work in some kind of a way.

973
00:54:07,695 --> 00:54:08,595
So that's me.

974
00:54:08,975 --> 00:54:13,557
I'm going to bring Robin back up and say thank you for having us.

975
00:54:15,898 --> 00:54:18,399
Thanks. I mean, yeah, I just don't really have so much to add.

976
00:54:18,439 --> 00:54:20,780
I'm just going to wrap this thing up by saying,

977
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:25,242
yeah, now there's never been a better time to make hardware games than now.

978
00:54:25,842 --> 00:54:29,183
And there's many routes to success and also many more routes, I think,

979
00:54:29,603 --> 00:54:30,884
than what we've shown you today.

980
00:54:30,904 --> 00:54:33,305
I want to show you two, right?

981
00:54:33,705 --> 00:54:37,426
And hopefully that talk inspired you to kind of make a game for yourself

982
00:54:38,087 --> 00:54:41,448
and, yeah, kind of get into the hardware scene.

983
00:54:41,568 --> 00:54:42,368
So, thanks.

984
00:54:51,419 --> 00:54:53,040
Just a tiny piece of housekeeping.

985
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,741
Please don't forget to fill out your evaluation forms.

986
00:54:56,261 --> 00:54:57,342
If you enjoyed what you saw.

987
00:54:57,542 --> 00:54:59,423
If you didn't enjoy, then don't fill them out.

988
00:55:01,164 --> 00:55:02,485
And do we have a couple of minutes for questions?

989
00:55:04,165 --> 00:55:06,647
So there's a mic in the middle, so you just step up to the

990
00:55:06,687 --> 00:55:07,587
mic in the middle there.

991
00:55:08,387 --> 00:55:09,388
And ask away.

992
00:55:09,588 --> 00:55:10,789
You have to go to it, I think.

993
00:55:10,809 --> 00:55:11,389
Yeah.

994
00:55:14,791 --> 00:55:16,813
Hi, that was a really insightful talk, thanks.

995
00:55:18,335 --> 00:55:20,997
So you talked a lot about iteration through exhibition.

996
00:55:21,738 --> 00:55:24,781
How do you encourage your players to give constructive

997
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:27,284
criticism, and how do you gather all your

998
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:28,085
feedback and things?

999
00:55:29,813 --> 00:55:33,778
So for me, it's kind of a more passive approach, so I kind of watch them play.

1000
00:55:33,798 --> 00:55:37,783
I mean, I guess that works well because it's a very simple interface, so you can kind of

1001
00:55:38,284 --> 00:55:40,347
visually see what they're doing and what they're doing wrong.

1002
00:55:41,648 --> 00:55:46,394
So for example, with DLIMOBLAR, the idea was you would shake the controller like this,

1003
00:55:46,434 --> 00:55:47,356
but everyone would kind of...

1004
00:55:48,346 --> 00:55:49,928
the controller and would not let go.

1005
00:55:50,228 --> 00:55:51,769
People aren't used to letting go of anything.

1006
00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:54,412
So in the first, I was like, oh, no, you can let go, you can let go.

1007
00:55:54,472 --> 00:55:58,015
And I kept repeating this, but you have to kind of give in to that.

1008
00:55:58,075 --> 00:56:00,858
So I made the game playable with kind of holding it.

1009
00:56:00,878 --> 00:56:04,781
So it's kind of an observant process and also kind of level balancing.

1010
00:56:04,921 --> 00:56:08,584
When people stop playing, that's kind of, aha, maybe I have to change something here.

1011
00:56:08,604 --> 00:56:11,427
So for me, it was a very kind of passive observant process.

1012
00:56:12,237 --> 00:56:16,237
So I think we do a lot of that just sitting back and kind of

1013
00:56:16,258 --> 00:56:16,858
taking notes.

1014
00:56:17,738 --> 00:56:21,779
We also, every time we run a play test, we agree a set of

1015
00:56:21,819 --> 00:56:24,119
questions that we're going to leave everybody with, just a

1016
00:56:24,159 --> 00:56:26,580
simple Google form, and then ask them to fill that out in

1017
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:27,320
their own time.

1018
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:31,581
We usually make sure that a member of our team, like a

1019
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:33,561
producer or somebody who's not on the front line of game

1020
00:56:33,581 --> 00:56:37,662
design, runs the process so that we kind of get as much

1021
00:56:38,543 --> 00:56:40,623
emotional distance between the makers and the

1022
00:56:40,663 --> 00:56:41,703
playtesters as possible.

1023
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:43,784
Basically, shut the fuck up.

1024
00:56:43,924 --> 00:56:46,966
That's my main rule about observing a playtest for me.

1025
00:56:47,426 --> 00:56:48,347
No, no, not like that.

1026
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:51,649
Thanks.

1027
00:56:52,489 --> 00:56:52,569
Cool.

1028
00:56:52,589 --> 00:56:56,631
All right, any other questions?

1029
00:56:56,691 --> 00:56:57,692
Any more for any more?

1030
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:58,072
Yeah.

1031
00:56:58,152 --> 00:56:58,832
Yeah, one at the front.

1032
00:57:00,113 --> 00:57:00,613
Come on down.

1033
00:57:04,209 --> 00:57:07,393
You both mentioned low latency.

1034
00:57:09,074 --> 00:57:11,457
Can you give some tips how to...

1035
00:57:12,538 --> 00:57:17,203
Robin maybe can tell how you make a video or promote yourself.

1036
00:57:17,263 --> 00:57:21,188
Because to get to those shows, you need to show something on a video.

1037
00:57:21,368 --> 00:57:22,389
It is very difficult.

1038
00:57:24,812 --> 00:57:31,054
Yeah, and you need to sell the product, so you actually need to convince the actual buyer to...

1039
00:57:31,674 --> 00:57:34,715
So how do you show this low latency?

1040
00:57:34,815 --> 00:57:36,576
Like, this stuff you can only feel.

1041
00:57:36,596 --> 00:57:38,937
So how do you deal with that?

1042
00:57:39,683 --> 00:57:43,965
Yeah, it is very tricky and that's actually a good point and an important point, like

1043
00:57:44,265 --> 00:57:48,066
especially with these LED strips, because they're so bright they're almost impossible

1044
00:57:48,086 --> 00:57:51,728
to take good videos of, because they immediately saturate the photo sensor.

1045
00:57:51,808 --> 00:57:55,649
So I now know how to do it, but it's kind of difficult, it's like HDR photography, you

1046
00:57:55,669 --> 00:57:56,049
can do it.

1047
00:57:57,670 --> 00:58:06,159
It is very difficult to convey what the game is about online, so if you see a video of it, you just see a flashing LED strip and a weird spring, and you have no idea what's going on.

1048
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:11,985
And it's also one of the reasons why I never thought about doing a Kickstarter, because you only get this online impression.

1049
00:58:12,366 --> 00:58:16,010
So you have to kind of convince them, they have to trust you basically.

1050
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:19,133
And for these experimental exhibitions that works...

1051
00:58:20,014 --> 00:58:24,477
For more general games exhibitions, it helps if you have shown elsewhere.

1052
00:58:25,618 --> 00:58:28,100
But it's kind of tricky to see that in a video.

1053
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,061
I always shoot 60 frames per second, so that helps a bit.

1054
00:58:30,081 --> 00:58:34,625
It makes it look smooth, but it doesn't really convey the kind of tactileness.

1055
00:58:35,065 --> 00:58:35,766
So it's tricky.

1056
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:40,090
So there's the marketing consumer's question,

1057
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:41,972
but there's also the marketing to industry.

1058
00:58:42,112 --> 00:58:44,654
And actually, it turns out that the whole toy industry

1059
00:58:44,754 --> 00:58:46,416
runs on face-to-face demos.

1060
00:58:46,897 --> 00:58:49,499
Like, we just came back from New York Toy Fair,

1061
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:52,883
where we had a booth, and it was just like being at an expo.

1062
00:58:53,123 --> 00:58:57,947
you know, we were there and basically all the buyers and all the toy companies come

1063
00:58:57,967 --> 00:58:58,488
by the booth.

1064
00:58:58,528 --> 00:59:01,550
We're in the kind of, so there's a, every single one of the toy fairs there's like a

1065
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:02,891
new start-ups area.

1066
00:59:03,272 --> 00:59:06,134
You can only be in there one time, so you want to make sure you do it right.

1067
00:59:06,274 --> 00:59:10,358
But everyone will come by there because they want to see what new stuff is around that

1068
00:59:10,418 --> 00:59:10,578
year.

1069
00:59:11,019 --> 00:59:15,722
So we worked super hard to figure out who we tried to get to come there.

1070
00:59:15,762 --> 00:59:19,285
So we had a whole sales process to get people to turn up.

1071
00:59:19,805 --> 00:59:23,068
The toy industry is an incredibly old school industry in lots of ways.

1072
00:59:23,128 --> 00:59:26,170
And one of the ways it is, is people go to these big toy fairs.

1073
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:28,452
The one in Nuremberg, the one in Hong Kong, the one in New York.

1074
00:59:28,832 --> 00:59:33,296
They put their hands on a bunch of things, and then they decide what they want to have in their stores that year,

1075
00:59:33,356 --> 00:59:35,137
and they make those decisions pretty much there and then.

1076
00:59:35,458 --> 00:59:42,864
You can do it outside of that, but the absolute huge majority of deals get struck in Toy Fair.

1077
00:59:43,244 --> 00:59:47,307
So actually, that's one way in which it sort of can be okay.

1078
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:48,829
Real quick, one last question.

1079
00:59:48,849 --> 00:59:50,250
One more, and then we'll have to wrap up.

1080
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:50,850
All right.

1081
00:59:51,439 --> 00:59:54,341
Uh, so do you guys, do you guys like patent all this stuff?

1082
00:59:54,881 --> 00:59:58,383
Or so like, what kinds of, uh, precautions do you take as far as like

1083
00:59:59,384 --> 01:00:00,405
preventing people from just like.

1084
01:00:00,987 --> 01:00:02,187
Ripping off your idea.

1085
01:00:02,387 --> 01:00:05,908
So I didn't patent anything and it seems to be very tricky in general.

1086
01:00:06,368 --> 01:00:09,889
So with hardware, I've read conflicting reports,

1087
01:00:09,969 --> 01:00:12,809
but one says when you show it publicly for the first time,

1088
01:00:12,849 --> 01:00:15,550
you basically waive your right to patent it.

1089
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:17,030
It depends on the country as well, I guess,

1090
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:19,851
but especially if you make weird hardware,

1091
01:00:19,871 --> 01:00:21,631
I have no idea if it's going to be successful

1092
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:22,812
unless you show it publicly.

1093
01:00:23,232 --> 01:00:25,192
So it is very tricky to do that,

1094
01:00:25,752 --> 01:00:27,593
and then in terms of gameplay,

1095
01:00:27,613 --> 01:00:30,333
you can't or shouldn't patent software anyway.

1096
01:00:30,353 --> 01:00:30,653
So it's...

1097
01:00:31,234 --> 01:00:36,495
It's for me it's all open so I just hope no one copies it and so it's just by presence.

1098
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:40,077
So it's like I show it everywhere so everyone associates the game with me.

1099
01:00:41,517 --> 01:00:43,218
So that kind of is my hope that it works.

1100
01:00:43,238 --> 01:00:45,819
So that brand and speed is a big part of defensibility.

1101
01:00:47,399 --> 01:00:52,702
So we have patented, and that's part and parcel of going the kind of VC investor route.

1102
01:00:52,742 --> 01:00:58,425
They're going to expect a different degree of kind of intellectual property underpinning for the stuff that you do.

1103
01:00:58,505 --> 01:00:59,766
So we've got patents and trademarks.

1104
01:01:00,446 --> 01:01:03,468
We've tried to trademark Fabulous Beasts, and then J.K. Rowling's lawyers said,

1105
01:01:03,648 --> 01:01:06,069
so about that name.

1106
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:09,471
So hey, Beast of Balance was a great name.

1107
01:01:09,511 --> 01:01:11,412
We were super happy to change that really fast.

1108
01:01:12,873 --> 01:01:16,834
So, yeah, like I think you can do that.

1109
01:01:16,874 --> 01:01:23,656
So in hardware, we are patenting a combination of hardware, software, and intended use.

1110
01:01:24,236 --> 01:01:29,518
So you're looking at the kind of overall system and the specific relationship between the sensors and the software,

1111
01:01:29,978 --> 01:01:31,479
any sensing algorithms that you've written.

1112
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:33,440
So that is, I think,

1113
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:38,502
That is very sort of top line defensible in terms of what a patent attorney will tell you.

1114
01:01:39,123 --> 01:01:42,344
It's super expensive and you have to do it before you disclose, so you're going to need

1115
01:01:42,404 --> 01:01:45,126
some kind of backing and a decision to go in that direction.

1116
01:01:45,666 --> 01:01:50,009
As well as brand and identity, the other thing that's defensible is make a weird thing.

1117
01:01:50,409 --> 01:01:55,892
Because frankly, the stuff that gets ripped off, a Chinese factory, if Fidget Cube had

1118
01:01:55,912 --> 01:01:59,734
been patented, it wouldn't have bothered the Chinese companies that have ripped it off.

1119
01:02:00,135 --> 01:02:01,175
It's just easy to copy.

1120
01:02:01,695 --> 01:02:03,456
It's super successful and it's easy to copy.

1121
01:02:03,536 --> 01:02:06,858
Our thing was reasonably successful and a real pain in the ass to copy.

1122
01:02:06,898 --> 01:02:10,679
Because who is going to go to the trouble of designing all of these pieces and kind of getting all of that stuff right?

1123
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:15,982
So in a way, going weird is a good way to defend yourself against imitators.

1124
01:02:17,222 --> 01:02:18,143
And slightly higher ends.

1125
01:02:18,203 --> 01:02:19,183
Like there is this kind of...

1126
01:02:20,161 --> 01:02:23,462
market emerging for tech toys, which are $100 and up.

1127
01:02:24,202 --> 01:02:26,463
And they necessitate more stuff in them.

1128
01:02:27,003 --> 01:02:29,464
And that makes them harder to imitate and copy than a thing

1129
01:02:29,484 --> 01:02:30,684
which is just like a single piece of

1130
01:02:30,704 --> 01:02:31,845
plastic or a single idea.

1131
01:02:32,305 --> 01:02:34,065
So there's another thing there to think about.

1132
01:02:35,826 --> 01:02:35,966
Cool.

1133
01:02:35,986 --> 01:02:37,426
Thank you, Robert and Roni.

1134
01:02:38,307 --> 01:02:38,567
Thanks.
