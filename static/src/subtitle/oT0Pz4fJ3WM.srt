00:00:06,957 --> 00:00:10,659
Hi, I'm Hannah Nicklin from Degoutte Fabrique.

2
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:12,260
I've tried to adjust my slides,

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,521
because I'm gonna be sitting here

4
00:00:13,701 --> 00:00:16,302
in the right hand side bottom corner of your screen.

5
00:00:16,863 --> 00:00:19,164
So I've made some slight adjustments.

6
00:00:19,224 --> 00:00:21,285
So anything that you can't see,

7
00:00:21,305 --> 00:00:23,167
just trust me that it's not that important.

8
00:00:23,187 --> 00:00:24,988
It's just sort of like a background setting.

9
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:30,331
And otherwise, if the slides seem a little bit unbalanced

10
00:00:30,371 --> 00:00:31,151
in terms of design,

11
00:00:31,272 --> 00:00:33,153
it's because I've had to move things around a little bit

12
00:00:33,193 --> 00:00:33,953
to make this work.

13
00:00:34,594 --> 00:00:41,219
So I hope it still gives you somewhat of the experience that you would have got had you been listening to this talk at GDC.

14
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:49,885
So I'm Hannah Nicklin, I'm from Die Güte Fabrik, and my talk is called Kill the Hero, Save the World.

15
00:00:50,807 --> 00:00:55,433
I'm the narrative designer and writer for Mutazione, which is a mutant soap opera where

16
00:00:55,513 --> 00:01:00,239
small-town gossip meets the supernatural, that's our tagline, which was released in

17
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:08,289
September 2019 on Apple Arcade, PS4 and PC, and I'm now CEO and Studio Lead of Devuted

18
00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:08,690
Fabric.

19
00:01:09,495 --> 00:01:13,416
Before transitioning to video games as a main practice, I also worked as a playwright and

20
00:01:13,456 --> 00:01:18,737
theatre maker and I have a PhD in the spaces between games and theatre and their uses as

21
00:01:18,818 --> 00:01:23,339
anti-capitalist practice. That might sometimes colour my perspective here a little bit, but

22
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:28,880
hopefully it's a useful perspective. I've been practising as a writer and game designer

23
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,820
therefore for over a decade.

24
00:01:33,179 --> 00:01:36,900
So I want to just take a moment to shout out the other talks which would have happened

25
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:41,761
by other members of the team. Nils Denneken was going to lead a talk on the visual design

26
00:01:41,781 --> 00:01:47,762
of the game. Christopher Holngard and Oscar Lusada were on a panel on the dialogue UI.

27
00:01:48,362 --> 00:01:52,583
And I was also super stoked to be on a narrative innovation panel with a whole host of awesome

28
00:01:52,623 --> 00:01:56,704
people working in narrative design and writing. I hope that they can submit their talks too,

29
00:01:57,244 --> 00:02:01,305
but in picking up the workload of a cancelled GDC, it's hard to find the time to record

30
00:02:01,345 --> 00:02:01,665
a talk.

31
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:10,007
We've lost a lot of expertise this year and I know that our team are especially sad that we can't mark the many years of hard work that we put into Metassione.

32
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:13,247
Solidarity with everyone affected across the world.

33
00:02:13,927 --> 00:02:22,289
A final aside, while I was the narrative designer and writer, my work was obviously deeply influenced by the skill and practice of other members of the team.

34
00:02:22,649 --> 00:02:28,330
Metassione is the work of many hands and hearts and minds over almost a decade of on and off production,

35
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,370
so if you have a copy of the game,

36
00:02:30,876 --> 00:02:37,518
please take the time to look at the credits. So this talk is called Kill the Hero, Save the World

37
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:43,319
and because I'm a writer it has a fairly predictable double meaning there. I think

38
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:47,941
that killing our heroes might produce better narrative worlds and games, that's one meaning,

39
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:51,442
but I also think there's something fairly politically urgent about destroying

40
00:02:51,562 --> 00:02:56,907
the narrative of heroic exceptionalism, that it allows us to tell better, more relatable,

41
00:02:57,047 --> 00:03:01,112
truer stories about how we live together in the world, and which begin to think through

42
00:03:01,132 --> 00:03:06,057
the qualities of the problems of our contemporary lives. I think one way to do that is to kill

43
00:03:06,077 --> 00:03:08,700
the hero and consider the ensemble cast.

44
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,262
And that's what my talk is about.

45
00:03:10,582 --> 00:03:14,567
But don't worry, I'm mostly going to concentrate on the practice of ensemble cast storytelling

46
00:03:14,687 --> 00:03:16,469
rather than the polemic or the politics of it.

47
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,632
There'll be a little sprinkling of that towards the end.

48
00:03:20,014 --> 00:03:23,739
So I'm going to talk first in more general terms about what ensemble casts are.

49
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:28,903
and how and why telling stories with them is different to telling a hero's tale story.

50
00:03:29,304 --> 00:03:33,567
And then I'm going to talk in depth about specific decisions and examples from Metassione to

51
00:03:33,888 --> 00:03:39,873
illustrate how I specifically went about it in writing for and designing Metassione's narrative.

52
00:03:40,694 --> 00:03:46,319
Okay, so kill the hero for better narrative worlds.

53
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:51,463
Why do I want us to think about alternatives to the hero's tale?

54
00:03:52,376 --> 00:03:59,264
Let's first set out what the hero's tale is. The hero's tale is also sometimes called the monomyth

55
00:03:59,744 --> 00:04:04,149
or the hero's journey and is a basic template for storytelling that features

56
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,574
a hero who goes on an adventure and overcomes some kind of

57
00:04:09,556 --> 00:04:12,699
obstacle, before returning, forever changed or transformed.

58
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,622
And it's the basis of a bunch of storytelling.

59
00:04:16,103 --> 00:04:20,727
I think we in particular gravitate towards the world revolving around one character in

60
00:04:20,787 --> 00:04:26,012
games because a lot of the language of games is borrowed from film, which loves the hero's

61
00:04:26,053 --> 00:04:26,333
tale.

62
00:04:26,613 --> 00:04:30,317
Although it's worth saying that the hero's tale is as old as Aristotle.

63
00:04:31,526 --> 00:04:37,113
Film loves to dive into single timeline psychologies, and it's really good at exploring these.

64
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:43,741
You have a discrete amount of attention, 90, 120 minutes or so, and you can carefully construct

65
00:04:43,962 --> 00:04:47,506
every moment to pressure and expose that hero in transition.

66
00:04:48,428 --> 00:05:00,175
But I think we need to interrogate whether the aesthetic and formal assumptions built into that tendency to use the language of film is actually useful to us in games, or at least if it's always useful to us.

67
00:05:00,956 --> 00:05:09,781
So, in order to do that, we have to understand how they work, why use them, and to take the time to ask what if there's something better than the hero's tale out there?

68
00:05:11,256 --> 00:05:14,778
So let's set out some of the qualities of the hero's tale.

69
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:18,201
Typically it revolves around one central character.

70
00:05:19,121 --> 00:05:23,564
In a patriarchal society it's usually a man, it's usually a white man, it's usually

71
00:05:23,604 --> 00:05:28,167
a white, cis, het man etc. And that central character begins

72
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:31,609
naive. They are called to a journey, they face

73
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:34,531
challenges and they return change which means that

74
00:05:35,212 --> 00:05:38,213
all the other characters in the story serve this forward arc.

75
00:05:38,694 --> 00:05:40,975
It becomes this, typically, man.

76
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:45,471
versus the world, versus characters, versus environment,

77
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,433
which are all there to serve their story.

78
00:05:48,344 --> 00:05:53,986
Victory is inevitable, especially in games when using the hero's tale, because when

79
00:05:54,006 --> 00:05:59,208
we build the player's identity into this hero, giving them room to fail as film more

80
00:05:59,308 --> 00:06:05,110
often can, giving them that room to fail is less possible because honestly it's not

81
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:10,032
fun to fail and the mechanics of games, whether it be puzzle solving or fighting battles,

82
00:06:10,432 --> 00:06:14,533
tend against it, leaving aside experimental practices here.

83
00:06:15,338 --> 00:06:18,800
This results in, more often, false jeopardy.

84
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,801
The feeling like, in the end,

85
00:06:20,821 --> 00:06:22,542
you never really had anything at stake.

86
00:06:23,403 --> 00:06:26,384
The hero's tale works when the psychological focus

87
00:06:26,424 --> 00:06:29,326
on one individual is served by a specific structure.

88
00:06:29,646 --> 00:06:33,889
For example, a short time span and a director's eye,

89
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:36,430
which can focus on their psychological journey.

90
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:49,361
So I'm asking what if the heroes format prominent in games, taken largely from films, is not suited to a lot of game stories, especially those that intend to run longer than two to four hours?

91
00:06:50,242 --> 00:06:54,025
Two to four hours is the length of a film or a long piece of theatre.

92
00:06:54,821 --> 00:07:00,142
A perfect unit, typically the content of the human bladder, how long you can hold yourself

93
00:07:00,182 --> 00:07:05,703
before needing the toilet, that is the… well, okay, films these days, think Marvel, etc,

94
00:07:06,284 --> 00:07:12,825
you kind of need a toilet break. But in general, this 2-4 hour length is a perfect unit in which

95
00:07:12,845 --> 00:07:17,146
to hold the attention of the audience or the player and to explore the inner workings of a

96
00:07:17,246 --> 00:07:22,067
single character as they're put under pressure, changed in the heat of whatever kind of story

97
00:07:22,087 --> 00:07:24,488
that you're trying to tell. When we're talking…

98
00:07:24,997 --> 00:07:29,361
longer than that single unit of human attention, everything changes.

99
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,119
You need new structures and foundations to make your story stand up.

100
00:07:33,859 --> 00:07:39,040
As people are able to, in games, explore a world rather than follow a directorial eye,

101
00:07:39,661 --> 00:07:45,382
as players choose their own camera angles and pacing and characterisation is shifted by player choice,

102
00:07:45,862 --> 00:07:47,962
focus can become dissipated.

103
00:07:48,523 --> 00:07:53,644
It's hard to provide the focus and interiority that you need to explore a single psyche,

104
00:07:54,324 --> 00:07:57,865
and the hero's tale begins to feel thin, interrupted.

105
00:07:59,113 --> 00:08:03,136
We also often pad out this single unit of storytelling with filler to make it longer,

106
00:08:03,636 --> 00:08:08,059
whether that be convoluted plotting or tasks that don't move the story or the characterisation

107
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:12,503
forward, which can in turn begin to make the story feel like it's decoupling from the

108
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:17,666
mechanics and that the world is there to occupy you rather than enthrall or move forward.

109
00:08:18,657 --> 00:08:23,161
That's not to say that it never works, but unless you have the resources to make an open

110
00:08:23,181 --> 00:08:27,365
world that is as delightful or thrilling to engage with at the level of something like

111
00:08:27,425 --> 00:08:33,070
Breath of the Wild, where actually I'd argue that the world itself is the hero, I think

112
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:39,456
we could be looking more often towards ensemble casts rather than heroes in order to build

113
00:08:39,536 --> 00:08:43,419
engaging, convincing and compelling open story worlds in games.

114
00:08:44,705 --> 00:08:49,048
So it's time to back away from the films, my friends, and try some other media.

115
00:08:49,888 --> 00:08:53,171
So I come from this experimental theatre background.

116
00:08:53,611 --> 00:08:56,673
This means I'm a really big fan of interdisciplinary thinking,

117
00:08:56,994 --> 00:09:00,436
learning from other art forms, collaborating with people from other art forms.

118
00:09:00,836 --> 00:09:04,059
And I think there's a big lesson out there for game storytelling

119
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:09,863
to be found in the ensemble cast template employed by long-running TV shows.

120
00:09:10,828 --> 00:09:15,171
You see, I'm not even going all arty interdisciplinary on you and explaining how we need to learn

121
00:09:15,191 --> 00:09:19,954
from contemporary dance or experimental live art. Not that we can't. Ask me about that

122
00:09:19,994 --> 00:09:23,396
in another talk. No, I'm just asking us to look to television.

123
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:29,980
So the Ensemble Cast TV Show template focuses on a group of characters rather than one central

124
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:36,064
hero style character. In this story template, it's the interplay of community rather than

125
00:09:36,104 --> 00:09:39,266
the victory of the hero which is the focus of the story.

126
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:43,616
So here are some qualities of ensemble cast storytelling.

127
00:09:45,037 --> 00:09:50,641
Ensemble cast storytelling focuses on a group of characters, giving many of them the same

128
00:09:50,701 --> 00:09:55,405
importance. It means that you're looking at a community rather than an individual under pressure.

129
00:09:56,245 --> 00:10:01,909
The drama arises from the community in context, either with their environment or each other.

130
00:10:02,863 --> 00:10:06,845
You can play with much more variety, whether that be different characters, locations,

131
00:10:07,245 --> 00:10:10,626
and that means that you can tell longer, more complex stories.

132
00:10:11,507 --> 00:10:14,468
You can play with different tones, comedy or drama,

133
00:10:14,728 --> 00:10:18,369
without making it all forced through one single character.

134
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:23,552
You can switch through different plot levels in order to give the pacing a break and a shape.

135
00:10:24,862 --> 00:10:28,383
conflicting points of view can arise when you have an ensemble cast.

136
00:10:28,843 --> 00:10:31,784
So rather than one true truth belonging to one person,

137
00:10:32,364 --> 00:10:35,285
several different people telling you different things can leave you guessing

138
00:10:35,425 --> 00:10:38,786
about the ending and provide more genuine jeopardy.

139
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:42,967
And the jeopardy at stake is something much more recognisable to our daily

140
00:10:43,007 --> 00:10:46,128
lives, where often there's no ideal action,

141
00:10:46,768 --> 00:10:51,190
no fully informed position, just people trying to do their best.

142
00:10:52,496 --> 00:10:59,177
So the ensemble cast can also examine cause and effect over longer periods, over generations,

143
00:10:59,918 --> 00:11:04,539
as communities often carry with them the consequences of past actions in a way that can be more

144
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:11,160
naturally exposed through lots of small clues, rather than one hero having to lore-dump their

145
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,340
whole psychology on you.

146
00:11:13,521 --> 00:11:18,642
Okay, so let's look at a concrete example of ensemble cast storytelling in action.

147
00:11:19,782 --> 00:11:20,502
Imitaciones.

148
00:11:21,544 --> 00:11:25,565
So I would define Mitassiene as an ensemble-cast-driven story.

149
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:30,927
When I joined the team nearly four years ago, it was being described by Nils Deniken,

150
00:11:31,547 --> 00:11:36,288
the creative director, as a soap opera. And that was a strong part of what appealed to me

151
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:41,249
about writing for it. Because soap operas are ensemble-cast-driven, and I think this

152
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:45,370
ensemble-cast format is massively underused as a template for game storytelling.

153
00:11:46,488 --> 00:11:52,452
By the way, if your instinct is to turn up your nose at soap opera, I would invite you to examine that reaction.

154
00:11:53,293 --> 00:11:59,357
A few reactions to the game online have focused on that soap opera label as wrong because they think it's a good game.

155
00:11:59,777 --> 00:12:04,680
I mean, thanks for thinking it's good, but I would say that rom-coms, soap operas,

156
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:09,944
they share that they're typically seen as feminine or domestic forms of storytelling.

157
00:12:10,388 --> 00:12:16,850
They often centre female characters and experiences, and therefore somehow lower quality, less

158
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,610
concerned with the big themes of life.

159
00:12:20,071 --> 00:12:23,492
But I'd argue that soap operas are not low-quality television.

160
00:12:24,052 --> 00:12:26,873
They are, to my mind, more neutral than that.

161
00:12:27,573 --> 00:12:33,935
They're defined by being long-running, character-driven, ensemble-classed slices of life.

162
00:12:34,739 --> 00:12:38,321
They share a lot of their qualities with situational comedies,

163
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:41,384
except they tend to be drama rather than comedy-driven.

164
00:12:42,265 --> 00:12:47,129
The soap bit of soap opera is just referring to those domestic concerns

165
00:12:47,869 --> 00:12:49,531
about a community in a place.

166
00:12:49,831 --> 00:12:51,893
Rather than using a journey to shape the drama,

167
00:12:52,193 --> 00:12:55,856
it's their past, present, and future context which is the heat of the storytelling.

168
00:12:57,172 --> 00:13:01,613
So let's take a look at some of the useful tactics of ensemble storytelling

169
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:06,634
and how they can be used to build a story world using my work in Matassione as an example.

170
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:10,215
And real quick, I'm not saying we did this totally right.

171
00:13:10,675 --> 00:13:14,856
With more resources, we would have liked to have been more elegant about fleshing out the world of

172
00:13:14,876 --> 00:13:19,757
the game. One particular key thing would have been interesting to us would be to allow you to

173
00:13:19,797 --> 00:13:24,278
play as other characters on different days in the game. But this is what we did with the resources

174
00:13:24,318 --> 00:13:26,758
that we had available, i.e. game dev.

175
00:13:27,881 --> 00:13:33,867
Okay, so first a little bit about the game, which you can find trailers and links to at

176
00:13:33,927 --> 00:13:38,471
metassionegame.com if you don't know how to spell that, it's written in the corner.

177
00:13:39,132 --> 00:13:42,215
That's how metassione is spelled and it's pronounced like I'm saying it.

178
00:13:42,595 --> 00:13:45,818
You can give it a bit more of an Italian flair, it's an Italian word if you want to.

179
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:55,205
that's my best impression. It was named by Nils and our long-time collaborator and incredible

180
00:13:55,245 --> 00:14:02,089
composer and musician Alessandro Coronas who lives in Sardinia so it's got sprinklings of Italian

181
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:07,953
all throughout the world. It's a 2D adventure style game where you explore a community over

182
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:14,037
a period of time. You can also gather seeds from the wild, talk to people, overhear conversations

183
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,899
and grow gardens with the seeds that you've collected.

184
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:23,151
In Mitassione, you explore the community as a 15-year-old girl called Kai.

185
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:27,153
Kai sets out at the beginning of the game thinking she's heading to the community to

186
00:14:27,193 --> 00:14:28,714
care for her dying grandfather.

187
00:14:29,474 --> 00:14:33,877
He thinks he's going to train her as a replacement spiritual leader for his strange and isolated

188
00:14:33,937 --> 00:14:35,077
town of Park Mutants.

189
00:14:35,678 --> 00:14:39,399
And by the end, both of them discover it's all a bit more complicated than that.

190
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,881
The answers are in the community itself.

191
00:14:42,944 --> 00:14:46,408
So Mottesione is this world of weird and wonderful flora and fauna,

192
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,892
and a community cast of characters of many shapes, sizes and colours.

193
00:14:50,647 --> 00:14:58,313
There are beautiful landscapes to explore, full of Mills's incredible art, and the great animations of our two animators.

194
00:14:58,894 --> 00:15:00,355
Please look up the credits as before.

195
00:15:01,436 --> 00:15:08,122
And there's this magical musical gardening mechanic at the heart of it, where you can create gardens, which are procedural music engines,

196
00:15:08,622 --> 00:15:15,588
where every seed you plant adds to the composition, and where each garden represents a step towards healing a fractured community.

197
00:15:16,421 --> 00:15:18,642
It's also, as I said, a soap opera.

198
00:15:19,262 --> 00:15:22,143
It's interested in the mundane as much as the sublime.

199
00:15:22,744 --> 00:15:25,165
It's about a community of people who live alongside

200
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:26,545
the consequences of the past,

201
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,166
as well as the actions of the present.

202
00:15:28,826 --> 00:15:31,107
There are love triangles and old wounds,

203
00:15:31,227 --> 00:15:33,128
band nights and communal barbecues.

204
00:15:34,568 --> 00:15:36,529
So that's a little bit about the game.

205
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,751
The following is how I employed some of the tactics

206
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:43,012
of ensemble storytelling in this fantasy-tinged

207
00:15:43,132 --> 00:15:44,993
alternative world of Mattassione.

208
00:15:47,275 --> 00:15:50,829
So I used a variety of characters and locations.

209
00:15:51,771 --> 00:15:56,175
We treated days in the game like chapters or episodes,

210
00:15:56,775 --> 00:15:58,977
and had special events and different characters

211
00:15:59,017 --> 00:16:00,778
to focus on in each episode.

212
00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:04,681
Varying the characters and key locations

213
00:16:05,202 --> 00:16:08,624
helped us keep the storytelling alive, engaging,

214
00:16:08,985 --> 00:16:11,567
and to use different characters to vary the pacing,

215
00:16:11,987 --> 00:16:13,528
meaning that we didn't have to generate

216
00:16:13,568 --> 00:16:16,110
relentless jeopardy in a single character arc.

217
00:16:16,591 --> 00:16:19,573
We were dipping into other characters' arcs every episode.

218
00:16:20,431 --> 00:16:26,976
While Kai is your way into the themes of Mitassione, it's only how the ensemble casts begin to build a

219
00:16:27,036 --> 00:16:31,659
sense of time, place, and presence that the themes and problems of the game begin to emerge.

220
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:36,242
You discover that this is a community dealing with intergenerational grief,

221
00:16:36,843 --> 00:16:40,445
and that by bearing witness to stuff people haven't been able to speak about,

222
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:46,810
by being the catalyst as a new person in the community, the community can begin to process it.

223
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,952
The story builds like a collage.

224
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:58,303
not at a point. And the gameplay rewards you in understanding this. So I design the narrative

225
00:16:58,343 --> 00:17:02,845
to work with what I call multiple middles. One of the first things that you're often

226
00:17:02,885 --> 00:17:08,267
asked about interactive narrative is how important are the choices? Do they matter? And I'd

227
00:17:08,307 --> 00:17:12,329
like to think that all the choices characters make in a game matter, but the amount of control

228
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:17,191
you have over them and what they in turn affect is often seen as the sum of how complex or

229
00:17:17,231 --> 00:17:18,992
accomplished a piece of narrative design is.

230
00:17:19,983 --> 00:17:24,467
A lot of games discourse tends towards judging the accomplishment of games on how close they

231
00:17:24,487 --> 00:17:29,391
get to the real world of choice and consequence, but sometimes abstraction is more valuable

232
00:17:29,431 --> 00:17:31,613
than simulation in helping us reflect on the world.

233
00:17:32,674 --> 00:17:37,759
When asked this question with regards to Mitassione, I like to talk about the game having multiple

234
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,681
middles rather than multiple endings.

235
00:17:40,635 --> 00:17:44,679
In conversations in the game I very much used the Kentucky Route Zero model of choice,

236
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:49,003
colouring how the character responds to the situation but not letting you choose who the

237
00:17:49,023 --> 00:17:55,509
character is. Are you attempt to be articulate Kai or are you diffuse the situation with a bad joke

238
00:17:55,589 --> 00:18:02,615
Kai? Either way you're still Kai. The conversations branch, you might access different reactions,

239
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:05,818
memories or stories but they come to the same place in the end.

240
00:18:06,957 --> 00:18:12,858
Instead, there's a great deal of choice in terms of which B, C, A plots you dig deeper down into,

241
00:18:13,618 --> 00:18:18,439
who you make deeper connections with, and how much the complex and thoroughly plotted history

242
00:18:18,479 --> 00:18:24,920
that you uncover. Multiple middles. This means you explore widely. This means that the game

243
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:31,322
rewards you for meandering, for exploring the context of the moment and uncovering the

244
00:18:31,422 --> 00:18:33,602
interrelationship of past and present.

245
00:18:34,412 --> 00:18:44,018
De-centering Kai by not making you control her and her character allows you to see the whole ensemble cast on the same level.

246
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,261
This allows conflicting points of view to emerge.

247
00:18:51,121 --> 00:19:00,987
Following and developing several characters instead of one allows for much more subtle exposition and conflict from which insight can emerge, again like a collage.

248
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:07,690
Not making the player invest everything in one character means that they can see a balance of points of view,

249
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,030
contrasting and highlighting one another.

250
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:14,192
It allows for the player to feel like they're choosing a way through the narrative,

251
00:19:14,392 --> 00:19:18,953
unpicking a mystery in a way that is cheap in terms of narrative design of interaction,

252
00:19:19,013 --> 00:19:22,414
like I'm not having to plot hundreds of thousands of branching paths,

253
00:19:22,814 --> 00:19:25,255
but it's rich in terms of player experience.

254
00:19:26,276 --> 00:19:31,157
In a hero's tale version of Mitassione, your grandfather would have been your guide in the game.

255
00:19:32,206 --> 00:19:34,607
and would have given you unbiased and true information.

256
00:19:35,367 --> 00:19:36,808
The other characters would have things

257
00:19:36,848 --> 00:19:38,268
that you needed to harvest

258
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:40,129
in order to proceed along your quest.

259
00:19:41,089 --> 00:19:43,230
But in our ensemble cast template,

260
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,731
as Mattassione progresses and your conversations begin

261
00:19:46,771 --> 00:19:49,572
to paint past conflicts and mistakes into the picture,

262
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,793
you realize that not only is your grandfather's account

263
00:19:52,933 --> 00:19:56,174
unreliable, but that the discontents in the community

264
00:19:56,275 --> 00:19:58,255
are not as soluble as he claims.

265
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,343
The choices we give in dialogue don't affect the outcome of the conversations.

266
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:07,986
They're more about revealing Kai's character than altering outcomes,

267
00:20:08,326 --> 00:20:11,788
and about uncovering the community through discourse with them.

268
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:15,931
It's meant to de-centre her from being a conventional player heroine.

269
00:20:16,571 --> 00:20:18,812
It also encourages the player to listen to,

270
00:20:18,832 --> 00:20:22,475
rather than solve, other characters when you spend time with them.

271
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:31,894
The big structural lesson when thinking about learning from long-running TV series is the

272
00:20:32,075 --> 00:20:35,016
A plot, B plot, C plot, and the Er plot.

273
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:39,638
So the Er plot is what I'm calling in TV the series-long plot.

274
00:20:40,238 --> 00:20:45,120
Not all ensemble shows have these, especially not slice-of-life ones, but having a central

275
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,641
theme or narrative problem

276
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:52,013
that the plot of the series returns to can be a pleasing and useful underlying rhythm.

277
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:57,154
Sometimes in like monster of the day style long-running tv shows,

278
00:20:57,514 --> 00:21:02,316
there'll be one main bad guy that they keep on returning to throughout the whole of the season

279
00:21:02,716 --> 00:21:04,457
and that's a good example of an ur-plot.

280
00:21:05,413 --> 00:21:10,815
Another good example, and a TV show which I return to a lot in writing the game, is

281
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:18,659
Star Trek DS9, a great example of ensemble cast TV formatting, that often uses season-long

282
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:23,341
er plots for the big historical shifts in the world and the wider Star Trek universe,

283
00:21:23,841 --> 00:21:29,343
but develops the characters and the community through A, B and C plots. They put community

284
00:21:29,403 --> 00:21:32,245
in context. Politics becomes practice.

285
00:21:33,773 --> 00:21:44,376
The ABC plots happen within episodes. The shifting focus of an ensemble cast allows

286
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:50,018
an episode to deal with one big theme or problem, whilst also varying the pace and levity with

287
00:21:50,118 --> 00:21:55,959
smaller subplots. Again, not all placing it on a hero, where shifts in tone could feel

288
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:56,780
unbalancing.

289
00:21:57,685 --> 00:22:01,292
The A-plot is the driving theme or problem of the episode.

290
00:22:02,053 --> 00:22:04,457
In day five of Mitassione, that might be,

291
00:22:04,517 --> 00:22:06,521
go on a boat trip with Tung and Miu

292
00:22:06,941 --> 00:22:08,905
and discover that you should grow a garden

293
00:22:08,965 --> 00:22:10,547
to help Tung with his boat making.

294
00:22:11,557 --> 00:22:17,923
B-plots are the secondary stories in an episode, often lighter, comedic, or contrasting thematically

295
00:22:17,963 --> 00:22:22,387
in a way that reflects on the A-plot, all of which makes the A-plot more compelling

296
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:28,233
when you return to it. In Day 5 and Mitassione, B-plots include following upon the events

297
00:22:28,273 --> 00:22:32,638
of the night before, when it was revealed that Spike the bartender has a long-running

298
00:22:32,698 --> 00:22:34,600
crush on Tung's mother, Claire.

299
00:22:35,795 --> 00:22:42,082
C-plots are the smallest unit and might resemble empty side quests, but the difference in an

300
00:22:42,102 --> 00:22:46,846
ensemble setting is that you care about the characters because of the previous investment

301
00:22:46,887 --> 00:22:51,611
that you've put into them, which means that these details can be dealt with lightly but

302
00:22:51,631 --> 00:22:55,355
also used to add to your satisfaction with the completeness of the universe.

303
00:22:56,285 --> 00:23:00,386
In day five of Meta-sione, a sea plot would include the sausage folk.

304
00:23:00,407 --> 00:23:02,427
If you haven't played the game, please do.

305
00:23:02,808 --> 00:23:04,748
And you'll find out all about the sausage people.

306
00:23:05,749 --> 00:23:09,831
They're plotting a new scheme, which this time will definitely make them all rich.

307
00:23:10,971 --> 00:23:14,272
I should add that Meta-sione is a non-monetary economy,

308
00:23:15,073 --> 00:23:18,114
so that gives you some sense of the levity of that plotline.

309
00:23:19,295 --> 00:23:22,136
So in Meta-sione, I make a conscious decision.

310
00:23:24,127 --> 00:23:30,792
plots, contributing to that er plot, mandatory. In each time of day, you have two or three

311
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:37,158
conversations or actions that, when completed, will move time forwards. We always mark the

312
00:23:37,198 --> 00:23:43,223
mandatory conversations with clear clues in a journal, and in the world, with a symbol

313
00:23:43,283 --> 00:23:47,146
that tells you when the last conversation will move time forwards.

314
00:23:50,249 --> 00:23:51,890
whether or not to move time forwards,

315
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,552
or to explore the many other hundreds

316
00:23:54,592 --> 00:23:56,093
and hundreds of conversations

317
00:23:56,113 --> 00:23:57,394
that you can have throughout the game.

318
00:23:58,455 --> 00:24:01,817
In Mitassione, each day in the game has an A-plot,

319
00:24:02,217 --> 00:24:03,678
which contributes to the E-plot,

320
00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:07,361
these mandatory conversations or actions.

321
00:24:08,001 --> 00:24:10,003
Then there's a great deal of choice

322
00:24:10,183 --> 00:24:11,764
in terms of B and C-plots,

323
00:24:11,804 --> 00:24:13,585
which you can dig deeper down into.

324
00:24:15,007 --> 00:24:20,591
with characters you can make deeper connections with, and you can choose therefore how much of

325
00:24:20,631 --> 00:24:27,998
the complex and thoroughly plotted history that you uncover. It gives play a choice in terms of

326
00:24:28,178 --> 00:24:34,703
breadth, in terms of exploration. That's why I talk about multiple middles, not multiple endings.

327
00:24:37,683 --> 00:24:42,385
So I therefore made narrative design decisions that focused on the characters as complex,

328
00:24:42,945 --> 00:24:47,787
rich, and I also made them a little bit different for the smallness of their community.

329
00:24:48,627 --> 00:24:53,848
I wanted getting to know them in this broad, exploratory way which rewarded

330
00:24:54,389 --> 00:25:00,472
the player for digging deeper, I wanted getting to know them to reflect this central musical

331
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:05,335
gardening mechanic, which was so wonderfully devised by Douglas Wilson and Alessandro Coronas,

332
00:25:05,835 --> 00:25:09,697
to feel like coming across a number of new plants you've never seen before,

333
00:25:11,698 --> 00:25:16,481
watching them grow, tending to them where possible, and allowing them to surprise you.

334
00:25:17,688 --> 00:25:21,790
I set out to build narrative design that would allow the player to choose their own pace,

335
00:25:22,331 --> 00:25:27,614
to push at the central plot, or to meander, wander, and grow the story at their own pace.

336
00:25:28,534 --> 00:25:34,378
The themes of the story are tough in places. Among the everyday, it also deals in trauma,

337
00:25:34,518 --> 00:25:40,101
colonialism, infidelity, aging, and illness. But in reviews, the game is often characterized

338
00:25:40,181 --> 00:25:45,445
as gentle, I think because of the opportunity that the player has to pace their own experience.

339
00:25:46,561 --> 00:25:50,423
Hopefully, as you play Metasione, none of this narrative design will feel visible.

340
00:25:51,023 --> 00:25:54,825
Instead, it'll feel like you're making your own way through a community full of life.

341
00:25:55,505 --> 00:26:00,008
A community that's lived long before you and, all being well, will live long after you leave.

342
00:26:01,248 --> 00:26:07,291
The Ensembl-Kast template allows me to imply this complexity and depth with a variety of voices,

343
00:26:07,711 --> 00:26:12,254
plotlines, and a form of player agency which reveals layers of the onion skin

344
00:26:12,734 --> 00:26:14,355
the more and more deeper you dig down.

345
00:26:16,152 --> 00:26:20,897
Finally, in the last couple of minutes, I'm going to touch lightly on the political implications

346
00:26:20,957 --> 00:26:27,824
of ensemble cast storytelling. All acts are political. All storytelling contains politics.

347
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:34,357
The choices in any piece of storytelling or design hold within them political assumptions and affordances.

348
00:26:35,077 --> 00:26:41,841
So as a last note, I'd like to say a little bit about why I think we should care about writing for ensembles rather than heroes,

349
00:26:42,502 --> 00:26:46,664
beyond the fact that it can help you tell a long-form story in a more compelling way.

350
00:26:49,146 --> 00:26:50,607
We live in a global society.

351
00:26:51,664 --> 00:26:57,867
My actions today in Copenhagen, what I choose to buy or eat, can have a material impact on people

352
00:26:57,967 --> 00:27:04,731
I will never meet in China or Maui or the Democratic Republic of Congo. Climate crisis

353
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:11,935
demands every country on earth take action. People die and are dying because of the fictions we draw

354
00:27:12,016 --> 00:27:19,900
on the world like borders and nations. We are connected. I wrote these words a month ago.

355
00:27:21,067 --> 00:27:24,688
before I'd ever heard the words novel coronavirus or COVID-19.

356
00:27:24,788 --> 00:27:30,390
I considered whether or not I should turn them down in the context of a

357
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:34,591
global pandemic and I assure you I don't mean to

358
00:27:34,691 --> 00:27:37,492
instrumentalise people's anxiety or suffering but

359
00:27:39,053 --> 00:27:41,813
this is just true. That's it.

360
00:27:43,518 --> 00:27:46,399
We were always connected, but now, more than ever,

361
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:49,321
we can wield our connections far more dangerously,

362
00:27:49,421 --> 00:27:51,241
and I think it's time we start to tell stories

363
00:27:51,301 --> 00:27:53,142
about the world that explore that,

364
00:27:54,742 --> 00:27:56,163
that do away with the hero,

365
00:27:57,243 --> 00:27:59,464
that begin to work on the challenges that emerge

366
00:27:59,504 --> 00:28:02,405
when we ask how we live together as an ensemble,

367
00:28:02,705 --> 00:28:04,546
that paints the people we touch with our lives

368
00:28:04,606 --> 00:28:06,687
as more than just non-player characters

369
00:28:06,807 --> 00:28:08,527
placed there to further our quest,

370
00:28:08,888 --> 00:28:11,428
or that says that we just need to wait for a hero

371
00:28:11,568 --> 00:28:13,029
to get us out of this mess.

372
00:28:14,774 --> 00:28:20,339
That's why I think it's not only useful for longer form games to tell stories with ensemble casts,

373
00:28:20,939 --> 00:28:24,903
but also, I think, urgently relevant.

374
00:28:27,385 --> 00:28:33,550
So, really quickly, key takeaways I'd offer to people thinking about telling an ensemble cast story.

375
00:28:34,814 --> 00:28:38,996
Make sure the ensemble cast characters reflect and shape one another.

376
00:28:39,776 --> 00:28:43,498
When you write a hero's journey, the character has to change beginning to end.

377
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:47,359
When you write for an ensemble cast, think about how they all change.

378
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:51,001
Think carefully about the player's presence in the world,

379
00:28:51,661 --> 00:28:55,122
and therefore the narrative design. Be diverse.

380
00:28:56,103 --> 00:28:59,984
In characters, varied identities, voices, backgrounds, perspectives.

381
00:29:00,665 --> 00:29:02,485
Make it rewarding to dig into the world.

382
00:29:04,066 --> 00:29:06,287
don't define characters by their difference.

383
00:29:07,368 --> 00:29:10,389
It's an easy and slightly lazy mistake to make

384
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:11,790
in building a diverse world

385
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:14,691
to make characters defined

386
00:29:14,791 --> 00:29:16,072
by the ways that they're different.

387
00:29:17,112 --> 00:29:19,213
But when characters live together in a community,

388
00:29:19,554 --> 00:29:21,374
they'll have a lot of similarities as well.

389
00:29:23,075 --> 00:29:25,537
Make characters surprising, complicated.

390
00:29:27,292 --> 00:29:31,575
Watch TV, but also operas and 24-hour durational theatre.

391
00:29:31,635 --> 00:29:34,377
Read detective novels, get to know the affordances

392
00:29:34,717 --> 00:29:38,219
of all of the forms and genres and the relationships

393
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:40,741
between audience and storytelling that exist out there.

394
00:29:42,462 --> 00:29:43,482
And keep track of it all.

395
00:29:44,403 --> 00:29:46,484
Your world, your universe, the past,

396
00:29:46,564 --> 00:29:49,806
the complicated present, how you conceptualize the story

397
00:29:49,966 --> 00:29:52,928
and storytelling and plotting, planning, and programming.

398
00:29:53,765 --> 00:30:00,406
Somewhere there is a 24-hour long presentation I could give about the spreadsheets and narrative

399
00:30:00,426 --> 00:30:05,487
design systems in Mitassione. You're not going to get it today, but think in a connected way

400
00:30:05,828 --> 00:30:10,629
between all departments about how you're going to tell the story, how you're going to manage time,

401
00:30:11,169 --> 00:30:15,710
how you're going to present characters, and what player exploration means in this world,

402
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:20,151
what choice means. And get rid of the hero.

403
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:26,594
Keep examining your assumptions about what storytelling is and how those assumptions shape

404
00:30:27,054 --> 00:30:32,278
your view of the world. Look to other cultures and forms, historical and contemporary,

405
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:38,303
especially outside of the Western tradition, and build your teams in a diverse way. There's

406
00:30:38,363 --> 00:30:43,586
no better way to write diverse stories than to build a team made up of diverse peoples.

407
00:30:44,947 --> 00:30:49,131
So, thank you so much for your time. I hope this has been valuable to you.

408
00:30:50,566 --> 00:30:54,349
You can find me at Hannah Nicklin, pretty much on all of the internet,

409
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:58,232
and Guta Fabrique is who you should follow

410
00:30:58,492 --> 00:31:01,374
on Twitter if you want to hear updates on the game.

411
00:31:01,394 --> 00:31:08,719
I hope that you're all well and safe and in these complicated times

412
00:31:10,801 --> 00:31:13,963
I wish you the strength and solidarity of good community.

413
00:31:15,084 --> 00:31:15,324
Thank you.
