Hi, I'm Matt Del Bosque, team lead programmer at Ubisoft Toronto.

00:00:07,827 --> 00:00:10,568
Watch Dogs 2's Bounty Mode is a hell of a lot of fun.

3
00:00:10,608 --> 00:00:14,170
When you get four players getting into a car chase at high speeds,

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,532
crashing into police cars, it's a lot of fun to play.

5
00:00:18,172 --> 00:00:21,994
But it wasn't a lot of fun to get those vehicles to replicate nicely.

6
00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:27,082
In my talk entitled Replicating Chaos, Vehicle Replication for Watch Dogs 2,

7
00:00:27,342 --> 00:00:34,027
I'm going to go over some of the techniques that we used to coordinate all of that and make it look nice.

8
00:00:34,327 --> 00:00:39,711
We're going to talk about some of the standard techniques such as projective velocity blending or snapshot buffers

9
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:45,514
that we used and adapted for our purposes and made them a bit more specific to vehicles.

10
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:53,945
Some of the things that we did to deal with collisions and other various problems that we had to face and solve along the way.

11
00:00:54,906 --> 00:01:00,112
This talk is aimed at online programmers of any ability levels, and I really hope to see you there.
