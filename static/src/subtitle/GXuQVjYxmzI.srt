1
00:00:06,337 --> 00:00:14,901
All right. Hey! All right. Apologies for the delay. It is my great pleasure to introduce

2
00:00:14,901 --> 00:00:21,304
two of my favorite people in the world, one in the flesh, one via the tubes. The tubes.

3
00:00:21,304 --> 00:00:33,990
Mr. Tommy Refines and Edmund McMillan, creators of Super Meat Boy.

4
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,811
Yes, that was clapping. Here, hold on.

5
00:00:38,324 --> 00:00:39,465
Say hi, Edmund.

6
00:00:39,465 --> 00:00:39,505
Hi.

7
00:00:39,505 --> 00:00:39,565
Hi.

8
00:00:39,565 --> 00:00:39,605
Hi.

9
00:00:39,605 --> 00:00:39,665
Hi.

10
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:39,725
Hi.

11
00:00:39,725 --> 00:00:39,785
Hi.

12
00:00:39,785 --> 00:00:40,265
Hi.

13
00:00:40,265 --> 00:00:46,788
So right now we're just kind of working out.

14
00:00:46,788 --> 00:00:49,689
We're going to have Edmund on Skype.

15
00:00:49,689 --> 00:00:52,750
He's flying in an airplane around the world right now.

16
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,252
So yeah, we're trying to get the satellite link up,

17
00:00:56,252 --> 00:00:57,012
hooked up, and everything.

18
00:00:57,012 --> 00:01:00,974
So once we do, we'll start this little post-mortem thing.

19
00:01:00,974 --> 00:01:01,614
Is it ready?

20
00:01:01,614 --> 00:01:02,074
Yeah, yes, I have it.

21
00:01:02,074 --> 00:01:03,135
All right, hold on.

22
00:01:05,418 --> 00:01:27,162
and I'll swap you over. That's my password. And then this is your microphone. Okay. So

23
00:01:27,162 --> 00:01:32,803
just hold this in front of your mouth.

24
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:52,436
Oh, okay. All right. Now I'm trying to remember my password for Skype. Excuse me. We aren't

25
00:01:52,436 --> 00:02:02,638
the most prepared people, so there we go.

26
00:02:03,925 --> 00:02:07,828
This is all GDC's fault.

27
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:11,772
This is in no way my fault.

28
00:02:11,772 --> 00:02:31,009
I was very, very prepared for this, as I am with everything in my life.

29
00:02:33,817 --> 00:02:37,159
Um, can you, can you hear me?

30
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:40,361
All right.

31
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:44,244
I'm going to hang up on the phone there.

32
00:02:44,244 --> 00:02:45,024
Okay.

33
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:50,388
Can, can you hear me, Edmund?

34
00:02:50,388 --> 00:02:51,529
Okay.

35
00:02:51,529 --> 00:02:53,590
Where's my piece of paper?

36
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,832
This is all fake.

37
00:02:56,832 --> 00:02:59,094
Like the moon landing.

38
00:02:59,094 --> 00:03:02,076
There's nobody in this room.

39
00:03:02,076 --> 00:03:02,536
All right.

40
00:03:11,427 --> 00:03:13,848
Let me uh...

41
00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:15,929
Ha ha ha!

42
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,911
There we go.

43
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:21,312
Switch mic...

44
00:03:21,312 --> 00:03:23,893
There it is.

45
00:03:23,893 --> 00:03:27,695
Okay, can you hear me, Edmund?

46
00:03:27,695 --> 00:03:28,276
Okay.

47
00:03:28,276 --> 00:03:33,278
All right!

48
00:03:33,278 --> 00:03:33,358
So...

49
00:03:33,358 --> 00:03:37,020
I had no doubts either.

50
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,241
So yeah, this is the uh... ... ... ... ...

51
00:03:40,456 --> 00:03:44,279
or what we're calling the Super Meat Boy Postmortem,

52
00:03:44,279 --> 00:03:50,544
which is more like the story of Meat Boy,

53
00:03:50,544 --> 00:03:54,047
peppered with various good and bad things.

54
00:03:54,047 --> 00:03:57,549
What is he doing?

55
00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:06,356
Yeah, yeah, so, yeah, we're going kind of non-traditional because,

56
00:04:06,356 --> 00:04:07,737
I don't know, just because.

57
00:04:07,737 --> 00:04:09,619
Because we can and this is what we do.

58
00:04:16,217 --> 00:04:16,477
Yeah.

59
00:04:16,477 --> 00:04:18,138
We just read through it.

60
00:04:18,138 --> 00:04:18,758
Yeah.

61
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:19,518
This is the talk.

62
00:04:19,518 --> 00:04:21,259
I just wrote it over here.

63
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:27,582
But we've gone through, we've gone through this development and we were so, like, you

64
00:04:27,582 --> 00:04:33,724
know, this meat boy development was so, like, personal and, you know, we were so attached

65
00:04:33,724 --> 00:04:37,985
to it that it really seems kind of silly to write down words that describe it.

66
00:04:37,985 --> 00:04:39,366
We'll just sort of talk about it.

67
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:44,228
So I don't know if you want to start with the origin story, Edmund.

68
00:04:46,242 --> 00:04:55,185
I'm sure most of you guys know that Meat Boy was originally a flash game that I made with a friend of mine, John McKinney.

69
00:04:55,185 --> 00:04:56,565
We made it in about three weeks.

70
00:04:56,565 --> 00:05:03,367
And honestly, I didn't think much of it. It was just like a little silly platformer.

71
00:05:03,367 --> 00:05:05,747
I didn't think anybody would care enough to shoot it.

72
00:05:05,747 --> 00:05:07,928
For some reason they did. They got really popular.

73
00:05:07,928 --> 00:05:12,489
And there's one of my most popular flash games right now.

74
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,956
My cat will definitely walk into the house and lick me.

75
00:05:16,956 --> 00:05:17,676
Sorry about that.

76
00:05:17,676 --> 00:05:21,018
So yeah, I was involved in a game around that time.

77
00:05:21,018 --> 00:05:24,780
I did a lot of different games and trying with my hard set.

78
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,342
I was able to do something with A-Pen and Publishers.

79
00:05:28,342 --> 00:05:33,705
Because I wanted to do something with Publishers.

80
00:05:33,705 --> 00:05:37,767
And I was able to get the initiative to tend to Microsoft.

81
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:42,970
But I didn't really work with anybody in the group program at all for consoles.

82
00:05:43,482 --> 00:05:49,384
And that was around the time where I met Tommy, which was actually at GDC.

83
00:05:49,384 --> 00:05:51,685
I think in 2008 or the end of 2008.

84
00:05:51,685 --> 00:06:00,009
And I met him and we talked about making games and it turned out we had known each other for a while.

85
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:04,071
seven years prior to going to the Harvard Blue-Grams Network.

86
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:06,453
And we thought, hey, we could try something out.

87
00:06:06,453 --> 00:06:08,074
We made a quick watch game together at one,

88
00:06:08,074 --> 00:06:12,916
and since you order so well together, we decided that

89
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,858
we'd go in and try to pick a console game,

90
00:06:15,858 --> 00:06:20,221
and the game that we thought would be the easiest

91
00:06:20,221 --> 00:06:24,243
and probably the most popular would be Meat Boy.

92
00:06:24,243 --> 00:06:28,585
So that's kind of where it all started.

93
00:06:33,196 --> 00:06:35,497
But yeah, like Ed mentioned, we both had websites a long time ago.

94
00:06:35,497 --> 00:06:36,198
Was that guppy?

95
00:06:36,198 --> 00:06:37,338
Yeah, I don't know what the fuck's wrong with him.

96
00:06:37,338 --> 00:06:37,819
Typical.

97
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:40,480
Typical.

98
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,863
Every morning, every single morning there's a dude who pisses.

99
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:53,708
And it's hard to like, scold him about it because he's so easily cleaned up and it's

100
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:59,271
like, oh, we have piss going on.

101
00:07:04,731 --> 00:07:07,572
But, yeah, you know.

102
00:07:07,572 --> 00:07:12,894
Yeah, so Ed and I, we knew each other like from a long time ago.

103
00:07:12,894 --> 00:07:17,655
You mentioned we both had websites around the time when New Grounds and everything was starting out.

104
00:07:17,655 --> 00:07:19,596
And we were both affiliates.

105
00:07:19,596 --> 00:07:21,917
We were both linked to each other.

106
00:07:21,917 --> 00:07:28,859
And, yeah, Ed went into the indie world and I went into soulless corporate world.

107
00:07:28,859 --> 00:07:32,280
And, yeah, we both kind of met up and decided, you know,

108
00:07:32,973 --> 00:07:37,636
Well, first we did, uh, we did gray matter together to see if we'd actually work out.

109
00:07:37,636 --> 00:07:40,698
And, um, that was a little flash game that we did.

110
00:07:40,698 --> 00:07:44,080
And that was, uh, I thought it was, I thought it was a good game.

111
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,582
We got a lot of plays. It was pretty good.

112
00:07:46,582 --> 00:07:53,386
Um, but yeah, we decided that, uh, yeah, let's, let's, let's make a console game.

113
00:07:53,386 --> 00:07:56,447
And I had played Meat Boy, and I, I really enjoyed it.

114
00:07:56,447 --> 00:08:00,130
And I, I actually beat it, the, the flash version with the...

115
00:08:01,325 --> 00:08:05,908
control issues and everything that it had, but yeah, it was my kind of game and, you

116
00:08:05,908 --> 00:08:11,991
know, we just sort of, yeah, it just seemed like a natural fit for something to make and

117
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:17,473
I was coming off of a project that I didn't really like and, yeah, I wanted to do something

118
00:08:17,473 --> 00:08:19,734
that was more related to me.

119
00:08:19,734 --> 00:08:25,637
So it just sort of worked out and that's when, well, you were talking to Nintendo around

120
00:08:25,637 --> 00:08:26,277
that time, weren't you?

121
00:08:28,553 --> 00:08:32,437
I couldn't get a hold of anybody who attended this video.

122
00:08:32,437 --> 00:08:34,199
I would call up Reggie daily, per week,

123
00:08:34,199 --> 00:08:37,742
to try to talk to him about WeWare.

124
00:08:37,742 --> 00:08:40,084
And he just, I never got to talk to him.

125
00:08:40,084 --> 00:08:42,246
And I actually posted that video online,

126
00:08:42,246 --> 00:08:46,850
and actually got an email from the guy in charge of WeWare,

127
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,994
asking if I was serious about WeWare gaming.

128
00:08:51,538 --> 00:08:56,020
I said yes, but at that point we didn't have any money for the kit either.

129
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,720
I didn't have any money myself.

130
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,481
And that was another problem.

131
00:08:59,481 --> 00:09:03,143
I was like, you know, one thing is like Ben, I was like,

132
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:06,524
how are we going to come up with like three grand to get a kit?

133
00:09:06,524 --> 00:09:07,465
It seems insane.

134
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:09,165
Yeah.

135
00:09:10,528 --> 00:09:16,412
I ended up doing an expansion pack for Meeple and then covering half the cost.

136
00:09:16,412 --> 00:09:21,916
And then Tommy covered the other half and then we won't be able to get out of jail.

137
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:29,421
I was already talking to Microsoft because, and this is something probably nobody really knows, but

138
00:09:29,421 --> 00:09:34,224
Tommy, me, Tommy, and Alex were all working on GISH 2 and that was going to be for Xbox Live.

139
00:09:34,224 --> 00:09:36,486
And that looks like we're all kind of merging.

140
00:09:37,002 --> 00:09:43,106
When we started Meat Boy, we were already talking to Microsoft, and when GISH 2 eventually didn't happen,

141
00:09:43,106 --> 00:09:51,633
the whole time we were trying to push Meat Boy to them, and eventually they picked up on it,

142
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:58,738
but it was something like, we always wanted to do Meat Boy for all the consoles, if possible,

143
00:09:58,738 --> 00:10:02,862
but we had kits for basically every console at that point.

144
00:10:03,598 --> 00:10:10,000
And we were just kind of going down the line and seeing, you know, what was going to work where.

145
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,920
Yeah, we had, um,

146
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,841
when we first started Meat Boy, I actually had it running on

147
00:10:14,841 --> 00:10:19,462
Xbox before I had it running on anything else. Because I started it on

148
00:10:19,462 --> 00:10:23,823
PC and I had already, you know, I had Xbox experience, so when I was writing the engine

149
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:27,664
I was just, I was writing it, you know, all DirectX and everything, so

150
00:10:27,664 --> 00:10:31,545
porting it over to Xbox wasn't difficult at all. So I actually had it running on that

151
00:10:31,545 --> 00:10:33,265
before I had it running on Wii, and then...

152
00:10:33,732 --> 00:10:40,578
had it running on PlayStation. And, yeah, we were, we were just sort of kind of shopping

153
00:10:40,578 --> 00:10:44,041
it around. We, you, yeah, like Edmund said, we definitely wanted to do it on everything.

154
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:51,307
And thinking about that now, like, if we would have put it on everything, I'd, I'd be dead.

155
00:10:51,307 --> 00:10:58,312
For sure I would be dead. Like, that's not a joke. Don't, don't. No, I, yeah, I, I almost

156
00:10:58,312 --> 00:11:02,636
died doing this version. And that's only on two things.

157
00:11:03,175 --> 00:11:05,076
Yeah, on like three or four, yeah, I'd be dead.

158
00:11:05,076 --> 00:11:08,758
Yeah, so we had it running on PlayStation and everything.

159
00:11:08,758 --> 00:11:15,621
Yeah, we were, yeah, well, let's see, around that time,

160
00:11:15,621 --> 00:11:18,443
so the first six months of development were actually

161
00:11:18,443 --> 00:11:21,705
me getting the engine working and getting an editor for Edmund

162
00:11:21,705 --> 00:11:22,845
so he could start building levels.

163
00:11:22,845 --> 00:11:26,807
Edmund really didn't touch the game until, well, let's see,

164
00:11:26,807 --> 00:11:31,410
we started in about February, what year is it?

165
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:31,890
It's 11, right?

166
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:32,610
We came out in 10.

167
00:11:36,371 --> 00:11:39,554
Now I'm actually having trouble now. Did we start in...

168
00:11:39,554 --> 00:11:42,536
We started in 2009. Like February 2009?

169
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:49,343
Yeah, because then the year later we were in IGF. Yeah, okay.

170
00:11:49,343 --> 00:11:50,644
So yeah, we started in February 2009.

171
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:55,648
That's when I was taking the engine for the first game I was working on called Goo,

172
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,610
and I was just refactoring everything.

173
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,913
I trashed everything and I was redoing it.

174
00:12:00,913 --> 00:12:02,995
And that was about six months or so of...

175
00:12:03,592 --> 00:12:07,473
you know, development, getting it up and running and getting an editor for Edmund.

176
00:12:07,473 --> 00:12:11,656
You actually didn't... like, I made, like, one of the first little levels

177
00:12:11,656 --> 00:12:14,457
to test out controls and everything, but you actually didn't make

178
00:12:14,457 --> 00:12:18,019
the first level, I think, until about June.

179
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:19,279
June or July, I think.

180
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,261
I was just sitting on my hands...

181
00:12:22,261 --> 00:12:23,401
Yeah.

182
00:12:23,401 --> 00:12:24,442
Waiting.

183
00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:29,805
That's what you do, though.

184
00:12:29,805 --> 00:12:32,546
You don't really... you don't really work.

185
00:12:33,614 --> 00:12:36,635
You just, you just kinda, you know, whatever.

186
00:12:36,635 --> 00:12:40,116
I just float around on webcam.

187
00:12:40,116 --> 00:12:44,237
Yeah, float around on webcam and yell at me.

188
00:12:44,237 --> 00:12:49,778
But yeah, so that was around the time, you know, so yeah, I had it

189
00:12:49,778 --> 00:12:53,599
running on WiiWare, and every year, the Wii dev kit, and

190
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:57,340
we got invited to a summit in London, where they were showing

191
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:01,701
a whole bunch of games, and our game, we only had, I believe, 12 levels at that time.

192
00:13:02,637 --> 00:13:06,738
It was like 12 levels we had a really early replay system in.

193
00:13:06,738 --> 00:13:07,799
There was no world map.

194
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,779
There was no cut scenes.

195
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:12,560
There was only Meat Boy.

196
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,421
I mean, it was a really, really early build,

197
00:13:14,421 --> 00:13:15,881
but it was still playable.

198
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:18,782
Oh yeah, and that's the, actually before that,

199
00:13:18,782 --> 00:13:22,783
we spent, before we actually did any real testing

200
00:13:22,783 --> 00:13:24,663
of levels or anything, we spent,

201
00:13:24,663 --> 00:13:28,164
I spent probably like two months just refining controls

202
00:13:28,164 --> 00:13:31,025
and trying to get controls exactly right and feeling.

203
00:13:31,483 --> 00:13:34,004
as good as we could possibly get them.

204
00:13:34,004 --> 00:13:38,125
And it was just a lot of duct taped physics kind of stuff.

205
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,406
There's no formula to describe the way

206
00:13:40,406 --> 00:13:41,906
Meat Boy moves in the air.

207
00:13:41,906 --> 00:13:46,088
There's no formula to describe how anything would move

208
00:13:46,088 --> 00:13:46,868
like Meat Boy in the air.

209
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,569
So it was just kind of duct taped.

210
00:13:48,569 --> 00:13:51,590
And I made a little thing for Edmund

211
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:54,651
that he could adjust values to further tweak everything.

212
00:13:54,651 --> 00:13:55,151
But yeah.

213
00:13:55,151 --> 00:14:00,373
See I justified, you know when he jumps off walls,

214
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:00,793
he jumps.

215
00:14:01,662 --> 00:14:09,886
like faster and further? Yeah. It's because he's pushing with his arms and his legs.

216
00:14:09,886 --> 00:14:16,070
That's good. It's a really, it's very accurate. If you were, if you were going to climb up

217
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:22,253
a wall or slide down a wall, you would definitely use your hands and legs. That's the thing,

218
00:14:22,253 --> 00:14:28,316
like nobody's doing that. Yeah. Those parkour kids, they do stuff like that.

219
00:14:31,561 --> 00:14:36,305
But yeah, so yeah, we had the controls and everything was feeling really, really good.

220
00:14:36,305 --> 00:14:43,330
Actually, we did have one cutscene. We had the black and white, the first black and white meat boy cutscene.

221
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:48,394
That's all we had. We had like the intro. Yeah, it looked pretty bad.

222
00:14:48,394 --> 00:14:52,177
I thought it looked pretty, but I don't know shit about art, so.

223
00:14:52,177 --> 00:15:00,803
I wasn't super happy with how it looked, but it was kind of like we were actually crunching for that summit like all week.

224
00:15:01,184 --> 00:15:05,007
And when you're freaking out about it, and that same week was the week where it was like,

225
00:15:05,007 --> 00:15:09,089
the most of the stuff that you were doing, I had no control over, so I had to give myself

226
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:09,750
something to do.

227
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,051
And that was when I made the comic.

228
00:15:12,051 --> 00:15:17,615
I decided, oh, well, if Tommy's gonna make, you know, all this shit, like, you were doing

229
00:15:17,615 --> 00:15:22,718
the replay feature, and if you were gonna do that in a week, then I was gonna make a

230
00:15:22,718 --> 00:15:26,561
comic in a week, so we could at least give something out, like, at the summit.

231
00:15:26,914 --> 00:15:33,979
improvised a comic book for the game that you we printed out and you took and you're able to hand out and stuff and

232
00:15:33,979 --> 00:15:39,322
But yeah, the summit I remember when you called from the summit you're like, holy shit like people really like this

233
00:15:39,322 --> 00:15:42,464
Mm-hmm, and it was like, you know, you know, maybe

234
00:15:42,464 --> 00:15:47,468
That was the point. I think we both realized maybe we should really make this into

235
00:15:47,468 --> 00:15:55,313
You know something really epic because originally it was something that was just gonna be a hundred levels on on the Wii on the PC

236
00:15:55,313 --> 00:15:56,173
Maybe on maybe on Xbox

237
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,657
It was gonna be something kinda small and simple.

238
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:02,798
We weren't gonna really add anything to it, were we?

239
00:16:02,798 --> 00:16:03,959
No, it was the no bosses.

240
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,239
Yeah, yeah, no bosses, yeah.

241
00:16:06,239 --> 00:16:07,760
Kind of like the Flash game recently.

242
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,560
Yeah.

243
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,182
The... I think after we saw that it had so much potential,

244
00:16:12,182 --> 00:16:13,462
and it was so fun,

245
00:16:13,462 --> 00:16:16,643
we just decided to go all out,

246
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:20,144
which was one of the reasons why we kinda

247
00:16:20,144 --> 00:16:22,565
lost sight of the file size stuff.

248
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:22,785
Yeah.

249
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:24,800
We'll come back to that.

250
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,860
Yeah, we kind of fell in love with the game.

251
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,461
Yeah.

252
00:16:28,461 --> 00:16:38,444
Totally blindly in love and just went all in and just crossed our fingers and hoped that we'd come out on the other side alive.

253
00:16:38,444 --> 00:16:42,525
Yeah, basically head down, power through, you know, Michael Bluth style in a way.

254
00:16:42,525 --> 00:16:48,167
But, yeah, like coming back from that summit, it was just like this crazy energy.

255
00:16:48,167 --> 00:16:52,348
We had, I've never seen somebody, like we had this one guy from Konami.

256
00:16:52,981 --> 00:16:53,221
and uh...

257
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:57,244
he was he was playing through one of it's a

258
00:16:57,244 --> 00:17:01,187
level one nineteen i don't remember the name of it is one we've had forever

259
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,167
and he

260
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:06,090
he kept dying over and over and he stood there

261
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:07,591
in front of this little kiosk on

262
00:17:07,591 --> 00:17:10,113
i think it was like the twentieth floor some

263
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:13,335
building or whatever and just played for like forty five minutes

264
00:17:13,335 --> 00:17:16,537
and died over and over and over then the game crashed and then i reset and then

265
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:18,298
he just went right back to it

266
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:20,560
and kept playing over and over and over and

267
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:20,600
uh...

268
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:25,730
when he finally beat it, he saw the replay feature, and he's like, oh, wow, you guys,

269
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,651
oh, this is awesome, we're going to steal this from you. And I kind of look at him,

270
00:17:28,651 --> 00:17:31,792
I go, well, you're going to have to hurry, because I guarantee we'll have it done before

271
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:37,535
you did. And that's when we were still going to do like 100 levels. But, you know, yeah,

272
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:43,077
we just, we came back from all of that and it seemed like a shame not to just, not to

273
00:17:43,077 --> 00:17:46,819
just go all out with it, not to just turn it into, you know.

274
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:52,885
exactly what we wanted to play and wanted it to be.

275
00:17:52,885 --> 00:17:55,827
And so yeah, when I came back,

276
00:17:55,827 --> 00:17:57,448
came back from London, we...

277
00:17:57,448 --> 00:18:01,810
Yeah, I think, was it, that was like right before,

278
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:04,811
it was right before TIG Jam,

279
00:18:04,811 --> 00:18:07,853
and then we started doing the alt levels, right?

280
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,014
Yeah, well that was around the same time

281
00:18:10,014 --> 00:18:11,655
when we were going into heavy negotiations.

282
00:18:11,655 --> 00:18:14,457
Like, that was when we were doing the switcheroonie

283
00:18:14,457 --> 00:18:15,457
with GISH2 and everyone else.

284
00:18:15,457 --> 00:18:16,658
Oh yeah, the switcheroo.

285
00:18:17,187 --> 00:18:26,651
We're trying our best to convince Microsoft that Meat Boy is something that people are going to like.

286
00:18:26,651 --> 00:18:31,414
We convinced at least one person and that person really fought for us.

287
00:18:31,414 --> 00:18:33,374
Hardcore.

288
00:18:33,374 --> 00:18:35,415
And that was a fight though.

289
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:39,737
A lot of people ask, you know, why the hell isn't it on PlayStation?

290
00:18:39,737 --> 00:18:44,960
And of course one of the reasons is that we don't want Tommy to die.

291
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,580
Yeah, we don't want Tommy to die yet.

292
00:18:46,988 --> 00:18:51,050
But aside from the obvious, it was that we are complete unknowns with no power.

293
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:54,351
Like, how do we walk into Microsoft's office and be like,

294
00:18:54,351 --> 00:19:01,353
okay, you're gonna do Meat Boy, and also, it's gonna be on the PlayStation and the Wii

295
00:19:01,353 --> 00:19:06,195
and everything else, and it's non-exclusive. Now do it.

296
00:19:06,195 --> 00:19:08,756
Like, that's something that can happen.

297
00:19:08,756 --> 00:19:13,898
It was like, this was... we were fighting really fucking hard just to get what we had.

298
00:19:14,482 --> 00:19:18,885
to get to release a month after on PC and possibly Wii

299
00:19:18,885 --> 00:19:22,907
was what we got in the contract and everything else was kind of out the door

300
00:19:22,907 --> 00:19:27,850
and that was as good as we could get. That was like months and months of back and forths

301
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:32,613
and negotiation. I actually think it was about, because we signed

302
00:19:32,613 --> 00:19:36,556
we signed with Microsoft, it was like January 2010

303
00:19:36,556 --> 00:19:42,540
and we were talking to them in August of 2009 back and forth

304
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:42,980
trying to

305
00:19:43,847 --> 00:19:46,348
trying to actually get them to sort of believe in the game.

306
00:19:46,348 --> 00:19:48,629
And I mean, it, one of the things I think really, really

307
00:19:48,629 --> 00:19:51,710
helped us in that situation was I already did have it running.

308
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:54,412
So it wasn't like I sent them a PC build or anything.

309
00:19:54,412 --> 00:19:57,193
I said, hey, throw this on your dev kit and give it a go.

310
00:19:57,193 --> 00:20:00,174
And then, you know, our guy over at Microsoft did and really

311
00:20:00,174 --> 00:20:02,996
liked it and everything.

312
00:20:02,996 --> 00:20:05,557
But, um, yeah, around that time, you know, speaking of like

313
00:20:05,557 --> 00:20:09,719
PlayStation and me not wanting to die, I took, um, I took

314
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:11,580
about, well,

315
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:18,462
Yeah, so I got my hands on like a little Sony dev kits, like halfway in between the big

316
00:20:18,462 --> 00:20:21,144
one that looks like a rack mount and a test kit.

317
00:20:21,144 --> 00:20:26,628
And I took about, it was like four days or something, and I took, and I ported the engine

318
00:20:26,628 --> 00:20:29,050
over to the PS3 and I had it running.

319
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:32,613
And I sent it to Sony, and for some reason they couldn't get it to run.

320
00:20:32,613 --> 00:20:36,415
I sent it to that game company and they were able to get it to run, and I was able to run

321
00:20:36,415 --> 00:20:38,357
it, but for some reason they couldn't.

322
00:20:38,357 --> 00:20:39,598
So I sent them a PC build.

323
00:20:40,209 --> 00:20:42,050
And then we never ever heard back from them.

324
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:49,013
So when it came time during like Xbox negotiations and stuff,

325
00:20:49,013 --> 00:20:53,034
you know, we kind of played it off sort of cocky in a way.

326
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:55,355
And we really didn't mean to.

327
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:58,356
But I have this thing where I constantly have arguments

328
00:20:58,356 --> 00:20:59,317
with people in my head.

329
00:20:59,317 --> 00:21:00,317
It's probably not very healthy.

330
00:21:00,317 --> 00:21:03,718
But like all the time, I'm sitting there and I'm going,

331
00:21:03,718 --> 00:21:04,779
well, what if they say this?

332
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:06,660
Well, then I'm going to come back to this.

333
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,240
I'm going to blah, blah, blah.

334
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:08,460
So.

335
00:21:09,887 --> 00:21:13,149
And this was the one time where it actually came up.

336
00:21:13,149 --> 00:21:17,451
So we were talking and they were kind of concerned that,

337
00:21:17,451 --> 00:21:20,813
like, one programmer doing it on two consoles by himself

338
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:22,234
was going to be difficult.

339
00:21:22,234 --> 00:21:25,155
And I knew they were going to say that.

340
00:21:25,155 --> 00:21:29,698
So I said, well, you tell whoever has a problem with that

341
00:21:29,698 --> 00:21:33,200
that I ported it to PlayStation in three, like, four days.

342
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,901
And they're our backup if you say no.

343
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:43,088
Kind of cocky, but true.

344
00:21:43,088 --> 00:21:47,770
I mean, it was four days, and yeah, if they would have said no, we would have put it on

345
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:48,331
PlayStation.

346
00:21:48,331 --> 00:21:49,271
So true.

347
00:21:49,271 --> 00:21:53,753
And then, yeah, like shortly after that, we actually signed with them, and they allowed

348
00:21:53,753 --> 00:21:58,356
us our month of exclusivity, and everything was going good then.

349
00:21:58,356 --> 00:22:06,540
That was right around the time of the IGF, which was, I don't know if stressful is the

350
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:06,880
right word.

351
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,240
What's worse than stressful?

352
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:18,535
I'd say one of the reasons I'm not physically there right now is because of the stress of GDC in general.

353
00:22:18,535 --> 00:22:20,417
It's usually like a...

354
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:20,497
It's...

355
00:22:20,497 --> 00:22:23,560
For like three months prior, I'm already stressing out about it.

356
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:29,265
And I know when we're in the IGF, and I feel for everybody in the IGF because...

357
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:32,668
I've been in the IGF many times and every fucking year it's like...

358
00:22:33,573 --> 00:22:36,195
It's like sleepless nights for months.

359
00:22:36,195 --> 00:22:38,417
You know, you're worried about your game making it in,

360
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:42,661
and then you're worried about your game, if it made it in, getting a prize,

361
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:47,224
or worried about, you know, talking to people there and the crowds and everything else.

362
00:22:47,224 --> 00:22:48,265
Yeah.

363
00:22:48,265 --> 00:22:51,988
And, you know, GDC is already stressful as is.

364
00:22:51,988 --> 00:22:52,108
But...

365
00:22:52,951 --> 00:22:57,576
yeah the whole IGF experience last year was even extra stressful for us because it wasn't that

366
00:22:57,576 --> 00:23:01,780
it wasn't that we lost it had nothing really to do with us losing losing it was kind of the

367
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:06,185
after effects where people kept coming up to us and saying hey I was a judge and um uh I didn't

368
00:23:06,185 --> 00:23:11,950
vote for you guys because you didn't need it because you already have a postal deal.

369
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:16,695
Yeah that one hurt quite a bit because I remember well I

370
00:23:17,318 --> 00:23:19,039
I mean, some of you know, I'm a diabetic.

371
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,980
Like, I'm type 1 diabetic, insulin dependent.

372
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,241
So, like, any sort of stress really destroys me.

373
00:23:24,241 --> 00:23:27,062
And it's unfortunate, but...

374
00:23:27,062 --> 00:23:29,083
So, kind of an awful story.

375
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:33,084
The night before they announced the finalists,

376
00:23:33,084 --> 00:23:34,865
I thought I was having a heart attack

377
00:23:34,865 --> 00:23:38,146
because I was so stressed out and I was,

378
00:23:38,146 --> 00:23:41,227
I was like, it was, it was so many, like,

379
00:23:41,227 --> 00:23:42,748
aspects of different kinds of stress.

380
00:23:42,748 --> 00:23:43,868
It's like, oh, if it doesn't get in,

381
00:23:43,868 --> 00:23:45,208
does that mean the game's not good

382
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:46,569
and we're being delusional and we're spending

383
00:23:46,569 --> 00:23:46,929
all this time?

384
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:49,143
Oh, but if it does get in, that's great,

385
00:23:49,143 --> 00:23:50,863
but what if it only gets in for this?

386
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:51,863
What if it doesn't get in for that?

387
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:53,844
Just all these things are going through my head,

388
00:23:53,844 --> 00:23:55,284
then it was like, well, if it doesn't get in,

389
00:23:55,284 --> 00:23:56,504
then I really can't face anybody.

390
00:23:56,504 --> 00:23:59,105
I'm not gonna go to GDC and see all my friends.

391
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:02,826
Just all these things are going around in my head.

392
00:24:02,826 --> 00:24:04,626
So I'm sitting there and I was talking

393
00:24:04,626 --> 00:24:05,966
on the phone with my parents.

394
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:09,327
And I was in tears and my heart was racing.

395
00:24:09,327 --> 00:24:12,828
And this was minutes before the midnight thing

396
00:24:12,828 --> 00:24:15,228
where they announced all the IGF finalists and stuff.

397
00:24:16,398 --> 00:24:22,243
Yeah, that was a lot of stress, and then the stress of getting in the judges' build, which

398
00:24:22,243 --> 00:24:28,308
we wanted to show more because we kind of felt it didn't get in for design, and a couple

399
00:24:28,308 --> 00:24:31,611
judges' comments said it didn't get in for design because it was only the first chapter.

400
00:24:31,611 --> 00:24:36,175
So we wanted to show what the game actually was, so we crunched and got the second chapter

401
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:40,298
in and got the first boss in, and I think we got in a couple cut scenes.

402
00:24:40,298 --> 00:24:42,260
We just polished what we had.

403
00:24:43,614 --> 00:24:46,416
And, you know, we were able to submit that.

404
00:24:46,416 --> 00:24:49,098
And, yeah, so it was just like a ton of stress.

405
00:24:49,098 --> 00:24:53,221
Then coming here to GDC last year was...

406
00:24:53,221 --> 00:24:56,723
I didn't think I was going to make it.

407
00:24:56,723 --> 00:24:58,604
I actually had to have my sister come with me

408
00:24:58,604 --> 00:25:02,687
because I was here and I was...

409
00:25:02,687 --> 00:25:04,268
I felt like I wanted to throw up all the time.

410
00:25:04,268 --> 00:25:05,909
My sugar was bouncing all over the place.

411
00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:09,171
And then, you know, when we get here and we have...

412
00:25:09,385 --> 00:25:13,106
people saying that they didn't vote for us because of little reasons like that.

413
00:25:13,106 --> 00:25:15,687
You know, we didn't need it. We actually kind of did.

414
00:25:15,687 --> 00:25:20,909
You know, yeah, we had a console deal. We didn't have any money.

415
00:25:20,909 --> 00:25:25,390
My bank account has been in the red several times during Meat Boy development.

416
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:31,852
But, you know, yeah, so and yeah, and then when we got all done with GDC, my A1C,

417
00:25:31,852 --> 00:25:34,052
which is like a three month total of your blood sugars,

418
00:25:34,052 --> 00:25:37,773
it's supposed to be like between four and five.

419
00:25:37,773 --> 00:25:38,293
It was 8.5.

420
00:25:38,815 --> 00:25:41,596
which means it was just riding super high and then going low,

421
00:25:41,596 --> 00:25:44,957
and then, you know, just kind of bouncing up and down.

422
00:25:44,957 --> 00:25:48,918
But yeah, I mean, we kind of just got through that as best we could.

423
00:25:48,918 --> 00:25:52,179
Yeah, it didn't hurt that we also had the pressures of...

424
00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:54,659
I mean, there was just so much pressure.

425
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:55,080
Yeah, it's just a ton.

426
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,500
And this was just the beginning of it.

427
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:56,700
Yeah.

428
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,801
Both of us are going from, you know, me especially, I'm going from,

429
00:26:00,801 --> 00:26:04,882
okay, I do Flash games and I do Indie games, and this is my first console game, so...

430
00:26:05,452 --> 00:26:07,112
This is me proving my worth.

431
00:26:07,112 --> 00:26:10,474
And it's hard to avoid that when it's quite literally that.

432
00:26:10,474 --> 00:26:15,097
Like, this is going to show everybody who I am and my value, essentially.

433
00:26:15,097 --> 00:26:17,138
So, you know, no stress there.

434
00:26:17,138 --> 00:26:22,841
And then, of course, the IGF, like Tommy said, you go into it thinking if you don't make it in, you're a loser.

435
00:26:22,841 --> 00:26:29,144
And it's hard not to think that way, especially when there's so much writing on it.

436
00:26:29,144 --> 00:26:31,345
And it's such a weird thing.

437
00:26:33,014 --> 00:26:45,863
For a game like Meat Boy that did so well, both me and Tommy were extremely worried that we would not make it into the IGF at all.

438
00:26:45,863 --> 00:26:52,288
Like, it's just, everybody kind of goes through these things where it's like, oh fuck, you know?

439
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:57,372
This is my baby, is it totally ugly and I can't see it? Like, is this my ugly freak baby that only I love?

440
00:26:57,372 --> 00:26:58,913
You worry about that stuff because...

441
00:26:59,915 --> 00:27:06,659
You know, it's just like, it's hard not to be, not to fall in love with what you're doing and then lose sight of if it's good or if it's bad.

442
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:07,360
Yeah.

443
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:22,869
And I think we just kind of just hoped that it, I mean, like Tommy mentioned, the summits and stuff like that and showing the game really helped us become more confident in the game and really believe in the game more.

444
00:27:22,869 --> 00:27:23,029
Yes.

445
00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:25,051
But the IGF situation in general was very stressful.

446
00:27:25,051 --> 00:27:28,633
It was weird for me too because I was going in...

447
00:27:29,118 --> 00:27:31,999
kind of feeling a bit like I've overstayed my welcome.

448
00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:36,081
And that was one of the things that kind of sucked too,

449
00:27:36,081 --> 00:27:38,302
because a few people, even friends of mine,

450
00:27:38,302 --> 00:27:41,983
said that they thought I shouldn't have entered

451
00:27:41,983 --> 00:27:44,164
because I'd already won in the past.

452
00:27:44,164 --> 00:27:44,705
And I kind of...

453
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:47,546
Totally forgetting that I haven't won shit.

454
00:27:47,546 --> 00:27:47,846
Yeah.

455
00:27:47,846 --> 00:27:49,607
I don't have any trophies or anything.

456
00:27:49,607 --> 00:27:49,747
Yeah.

457
00:27:49,747 --> 00:27:50,107
Yeah.

458
00:27:50,107 --> 00:27:50,747
But, yeah, it was weird.

459
00:27:50,747 --> 00:27:51,568
And I guess I have.

460
00:27:51,568 --> 00:27:54,189
I guess I have overstayed my welcome a bit.

461
00:27:54,189 --> 00:27:57,650
And that's kind of a sad thing about the IGF,

462
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:58,911
is that it kind of was.

463
00:27:59,306 --> 00:28:03,689
Like, definitely now I feel like I don't feel comfortable entering the IGF anymore.

464
00:28:03,689 --> 00:28:07,371
But, uh, I guess it's just something you go through.

465
00:28:07,371 --> 00:28:10,053
And I think I entered seven times and made it in six.

466
00:28:10,053 --> 00:28:13,595
So, that's a good run and I had fun while I was there, but...

467
00:28:13,595 --> 00:28:16,517
I guess, yeah, no more entering the IGF.

468
00:28:16,517 --> 00:28:18,778
It's so fucking stressful either way.

469
00:28:18,778 --> 00:28:20,760
Yeah, yeah, that's...

470
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:27,604
I mean, I'd say a lot of the things that really slowed us down were...

471
00:28:28,601 --> 00:28:36,285
were conventions. Like we did GDC and when we got back from that, that was when Tommy

472
00:28:36,285 --> 00:28:41,308
did his rant as well, which was a high point. We got back from GDC and we were like just

473
00:28:41,308 --> 00:28:46,791
kind of sitting next to each other not working, going like what the fuck, you know, what the

474
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:52,454
fuck's going on and just kind of like, you know, being sad.

475
00:28:52,454 --> 00:28:54,996
Yeah, it was super sad.

476
00:28:55,737 --> 00:29:00,520
But what we ended up doing was we took that and we just pushed it all on the iPhone situation

477
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:05,523
and we decided, you know, we're going to pick ourselves back up by basically making a joke

478
00:29:05,523 --> 00:29:10,787
game for the App Store, which was a Me Boy handheld game that looked like a tiger handheld

479
00:29:10,787 --> 00:29:10,887
game.

480
00:29:10,887 --> 00:29:11,267
Yeah.

481
00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:12,508
Which we put up.

482
00:29:12,508 --> 00:29:18,112
We did that like over a weekend and it kind of eased us back into development.

483
00:29:18,112 --> 00:29:20,533
But then right after that we ended up doing E3.

484
00:29:20,533 --> 00:29:20,813
Yeah.

485
00:29:20,813 --> 00:29:23,895
And every time we do these events we have to like...

486
00:29:24,813 --> 00:29:30,797
We have to focus all of our work on the build so we can show it so it looks pretty.

487
00:29:30,797 --> 00:29:40,425
And then it will take away from development overall because we'll end up working on stuff that we shouldn't be needing to work on just so we can show it so it looks good.

488
00:29:40,425 --> 00:29:54,456
So like both the IGF and GDC kind of fucked with our deadline and pushed us back a couple months because we were working on things that were just kind of for show when we really should have been working on core aspects of the game to get moving on.

489
00:29:55,214 --> 00:30:03,055
Yeah, we should have been doing stuff like we should like I think at the point of did we have hell in for E3? I don't remember.

490
00:30:03,055 --> 00:30:03,756
I had just started it.

491
00:30:03,756 --> 00:30:22,959
Okay. Yeah. So we what we should have been doing is making all of the obstacles for the next chapters and working on the bosses and then going back and polishing everything. But we kind of, you know, we just weren't able aren't able to do that when when Microsoft's like, hey, you have a booth at E3.

492
00:30:24,391 --> 00:30:31,676
You don't say, no thanks. You know, not right now. You know, you just don't do that. And

493
00:30:31,676 --> 00:30:36,860
I mean, I've always, I've wanted to go to E3 forever and then having my game there,

494
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:43,664
you know, it's just like, that just kind of sweetens the deal. So, yeah, that was, yeah,

495
00:30:43,664 --> 00:30:48,247
that E3 build was like, I was trying to fix this one audio bug which I actually didn't

496
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:52,290
fix in time. And, yeah, it was just super stressful being up.

497
00:30:52,687 --> 00:30:57,731
you know, getting up at like 8 o'clock in the morning and working until 11 o'clock in

498
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:01,914
the morning the next day kind of thing. Like trying to make sure the build is uploaded

499
00:31:01,914 --> 00:31:08,098
and then my internet would fuck up and that would screw up the upload because I have shitty

500
00:31:08,098 --> 00:31:12,561
DSL and it would upload like 50k and the build is like 160 megs going up. So yeah, it was

501
00:31:12,561 --> 00:31:16,304
just, it was just a lot of like really, really awful stress. But I mean we got through that.

502
00:31:16,304 --> 00:31:22,388
We went to E3. E3 was great. I mean people, it just further...

503
00:31:22,762 --> 00:31:25,723
Whenever we go to those things, and Ed's mentioned it,

504
00:31:25,723 --> 00:31:28,865
but whenever we go and we see people play the game

505
00:31:28,865 --> 00:31:33,088
and not put it down, that took any sadness that we had

506
00:31:33,088 --> 00:31:35,349
and just sort of, it just put it off to the side.

507
00:31:35,349 --> 00:31:38,011
And it said, well, you need to focus on this

508
00:31:38,011 --> 00:31:42,113
because this game is badass and people think it's badass.

509
00:31:42,113 --> 00:31:44,835
So forget all the drama bullshit

510
00:31:44,835 --> 00:31:45,995
and just focus on the game.

511
00:31:45,995 --> 00:31:46,796
And that's kind of what we did

512
00:31:46,796 --> 00:31:48,897
throughout the summer after E3.

513
00:31:51,575 --> 00:31:58,281
But yeah, around July of 2010, is that when Game Feast stuff came up?

514
00:31:58,281 --> 00:31:59,221
I think that's when we...

515
00:31:59,221 --> 00:32:00,883
No, that's August.

516
00:32:00,883 --> 00:32:01,503
Was that August?

517
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:05,347
Yeah, I know, because it happened around Daniel's birthday.

518
00:32:05,347 --> 00:32:08,289
But, oh yeah, but what we were doing is we were trying to...

519
00:32:08,289 --> 00:32:13,874
We were trying to get the game out right after Summer of Arcade.

520
00:32:13,874 --> 00:32:15,536
And we were in...

521
00:32:15,536 --> 00:32:17,718
Because we were starting to go into bug testing in July.

522
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:21,450
And yeah, then the promotion came up.

523
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:26,253
And that's where the most awful part of development was.

524
00:32:26,253 --> 00:32:30,256
Was that part when we had a launch,

525
00:32:30,256 --> 00:32:33,618
we had a tentative launch date that was like fall.

526
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:37,020
And then Microsoft wanted to do the game feast thing with us.

527
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,421
And they basically told us, you know,

528
00:32:39,421 --> 00:32:40,782
we wanted Summer of Arcade.

529
00:32:40,782 --> 00:32:42,844
We got pushed back for various reasons.

530
00:32:42,844 --> 00:32:45,645
And yeah, we were kind of bummed about Summer of Arcade,

531
00:32:45,645 --> 00:32:46,846
but you know, whatever.

532
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:57,433
And they basically told us that if we didn't get into a promotion with them, that it would...

533
00:32:57,433 --> 00:33:01,075
we wouldn't... the game wouldn't do as well, you know, because it wouldn't be heavily promoted

534
00:33:01,075 --> 00:33:04,197
by Microsoft like some of our arcade games are.

535
00:33:04,197 --> 00:33:09,081
And, you know, when we heard that they were doing another promotion, we said...

536
00:33:09,081 --> 00:33:12,303
I remember saying, we will make this no matter what.

537
00:33:12,303 --> 00:33:14,665
Because it was still a tight deadline.

538
00:33:14,665 --> 00:33:17,547
It was two months to get through everything.

539
00:33:17,823 --> 00:33:22,266
I mean, all of the bugs, all of the certification, all that stuff.

540
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:28,311
It took, and I remember looking at the calendar and I remember feeling the panic and I remember

541
00:33:28,311 --> 00:33:33,595
feeling just all of the stress of that and just going, well, and honestly, this is not

542
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:34,076
a joke.

543
00:33:34,076 --> 00:33:35,617
It's going to sound like a joke.

544
00:33:35,617 --> 00:33:38,379
I said to myself, I said, I will die after this is done.

545
00:33:38,379 --> 00:33:42,723
And I, cause I honestly felt like with the stress and everything that I was, I was going

546
00:33:42,723 --> 00:33:43,663
to fall over.

547
00:33:43,663 --> 00:33:46,926
I was going to have some sort of diabetic coma or something.

548
00:33:47,343 --> 00:33:52,585
and I was going to die. And I just kept thinking, I will push through this and if I can make

549
00:33:52,585 --> 00:33:55,946
it through then I probably won't die, but it's okay if I die afterward.

550
00:33:55,946 --> 00:34:02,527
There was so much pressure. It's really hard to convey, especially now that we can laugh

551
00:34:02,527 --> 00:34:09,449
about it. But like, going in it was quite literally like, okay here's this promotion,

552
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:15,231
if you don't get into this promotion then the next promotion is going to be, you know.

553
00:34:16,497 --> 00:34:23,319
you know, six months away, so we didn't have any money at all at that time and we had to release the game.

554
00:34:23,319 --> 00:34:25,700
I was negative 800 at that point.

555
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,020
Yeah.

556
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,860
Negative 853 dollars is what I had.

557
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,200
Yeah.

558
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:33,722
So we were kind of fucked and we were in a situation where we simply had to do it.

559
00:34:33,722 --> 00:34:43,004
And what they were asking us to do was essentially finish a game in two months that would take, that should take like a company four months.

560
00:34:43,004 --> 00:34:43,224
Yeah.

561
00:34:43,557 --> 00:34:51,703
That's like going through all testing, all bug testing and everything, and basically finishing the game.

562
00:34:51,703 --> 00:34:56,567
And once we actually went into testing, the game wasn't finished yet.

563
00:34:56,567 --> 00:34:59,169
And that's when things got really bad.

564
00:34:59,169 --> 00:35:06,495
And this isn't an over-exaggeration, like, the last two months, two full months of development...

565
00:35:07,118 --> 00:35:08,920
Tommy and I never took a day off.

566
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:13,407
And I don't think we slept for more than five hours a night

567
00:35:13,407 --> 00:35:14,588
for those two months.

568
00:35:14,588 --> 00:35:18,874
So I would go through phases where I'd be getting up,

569
00:35:18,874 --> 00:35:19,635
I'd get up, I'd...

570
00:35:20,398 --> 00:35:27,822
I get a glass of orange juice and sit next to the computer, and like, I've been wearing glasses for many, many years.

571
00:35:27,822 --> 00:35:32,305
And there were times where I, somehow, everything was blurry, and I didn't understand why.

572
00:35:32,305 --> 00:35:36,207
And it turned out, I never put on my glasses, and it made no sense.

573
00:35:36,207 --> 00:35:43,170
It was like, what kind of fucking bizarre loop am I in where I don't do something that's routine every day, but yet I'm in this weird loop?

574
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:46,772
It seemed like a Groundhog Day situation where I was...

575
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:51,943
Constantly reliving the same horrible day over and over and over again.

576
00:35:51,943 --> 00:35:52,243
Yes.

577
00:35:52,243 --> 00:35:55,985
And it just seemed like we were just treading water.

578
00:35:55,985 --> 00:35:58,086
And it's just like, what the fuck's happening?

579
00:35:58,086 --> 00:36:01,469
And I was feeling horrible.

580
00:36:01,469 --> 00:36:02,849
And Tommy says a lot of like...

581
00:36:02,849 --> 00:36:07,112
He didn't tell me about his major worries about dying

582
00:36:07,112 --> 00:36:08,313
until things eased up a bit.

583
00:36:08,313 --> 00:36:12,215
Because I think we were both keeping things from each other.

584
00:36:12,215 --> 00:36:15,317
So we didn't overwhelm the other person.

585
00:36:15,317 --> 00:36:16,078
And I know there were...

586
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,821
I think it was the last month of development.

587
00:36:19,821 --> 00:36:25,502
Um, I would, I, maybe once a week, when I was going to bed, I would tell my wife,

588
00:36:25,502 --> 00:36:28,863
I want to stop. I don't want to do this anymore. This isn't worth it.

589
00:36:28,863 --> 00:36:33,144
Like, um, I, I was feeling not only horrible, just from all the work,

590
00:36:33,144 --> 00:36:37,925
but I was also feeling extra guilty knowing that Tommy is suffering even more

591
00:36:37,925 --> 00:36:42,006
because we're at the point where we're just doing bug testing.

592
00:36:42,006 --> 00:36:44,866
And I can't really help in that department.

593
00:36:44,866 --> 00:36:45,867
Like, I can do so much, but...

594
00:36:46,429 --> 00:36:50,090
most of it was just falling on his shoulders and I saw that it just kept piling up and it was just like

595
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:54,472
yeah it was seriously I would have just thrown it all away I would have said fuck the game you know I don't

596
00:36:54,472 --> 00:36:57,372
I don't want to release this this is just not worth it I don't it was horrible

597
00:36:57,372 --> 00:37:02,394
yeah that's a it's a bad practice in development to

598
00:37:02,394 --> 00:37:05,495
be going through bug fixing as you're implementing features

599
00:37:05,495 --> 00:37:10,416
um I don't know if you guys know this but it is a fact

600
00:37:10,416 --> 00:37:14,718
um because yeah this is this is how this is how my day

601
00:37:14,718 --> 00:37:15,558
consisted this is

602
00:37:16,411 --> 00:37:21,574
I would go to bed. I would have crazy fever dreams about fixing bugs. So it wasn't really

603
00:37:21,574 --> 00:37:27,517
good sleep. I would wake up and fix the bugs from my dreams. Like, that's a serious thing.

604
00:37:27,517 --> 00:37:32,760
I fix so many bugs by dreaming about them, it's insane. But I would fix those and I would

605
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:38,683
log on to my little Microsoft thing that would tell me the bugs. And there would be like,

606
00:37:38,683 --> 00:37:40,524
oh, let's say, 129 bugs. I'd be like, great.

607
00:37:41,389 --> 00:37:45,951
focus. And at that point I was only eating like one meal a day and my parents were bringing

608
00:37:45,951 --> 00:37:50,612
it to me because they knew if they didn't bring me the meals I would not eat and I would

609
00:37:50,612 --> 00:37:53,813
therefore die. And my parents are kind of fond of me so they didn't want me to die so

610
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:59,815
they brought me meals. But yeah, I would get up, I would log into that thing and I would

611
00:37:59,815 --> 00:38:06,017
focus. I usually don't listen to music or anything when I'm working. That was the only

612
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:06,697
time I did because

613
00:38:07,912 --> 00:38:12,553
I get like involved in stuff if I block everything else out. So usually I have like the TV on

614
00:38:12,553 --> 00:38:17,575
or something so I don't, you know, work for like 28 hours straight or anything. So I had

615
00:38:17,575 --> 00:38:25,837
music on, I am fixing bugs and most days I would get the 129 bugs down to 30 or 20. Then

616
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:29,018
I would go to bed and I would have my fever dreams and I would wake up and there would

617
00:38:29,018 --> 00:38:33,799
be 150 bugs because the testers, they tested all night and all day while I was sleeping

618
00:38:33,799 --> 00:38:36,420
and they found even more shit because as I was...

619
00:38:36,828 --> 00:38:43,651
implementing fixes for the bugs, I was also implementing new features, which meant that

620
00:38:43,651 --> 00:38:50,454
there would be new stuff that the testers would try out, and then that would break old

621
00:38:50,454 --> 00:38:57,237
stuff and this went on for at least a month and a half of pure hell.

622
00:38:57,237 --> 00:39:01,538
So, but yeah, I mean, you know, we got through it.

623
00:39:01,538 --> 00:39:01,959
Somehow.

624
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:02,419
I don't know.

625
00:39:02,419 --> 00:39:02,919
I do not know how.

626
00:39:02,919 --> 00:39:05,880
I still think back to those months and I'm just like, Jesus Christ.

627
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:11,821
I guess the human body can just do it when it needs to, but like, there's no way in hell that I could ever

628
00:39:11,821 --> 00:39:13,342
voluntarily go through something like that again.

629
00:39:13,342 --> 00:39:13,622
Nope.

630
00:39:13,622 --> 00:39:16,022
I would never want to put myself through that again.

631
00:39:16,022 --> 00:39:17,462
If somebody said, hey, want to do Meat Boy again?

632
00:39:17,462 --> 00:39:22,803
And, you know, you're going to get the same amount of success.

633
00:39:22,803 --> 00:39:24,304
There's no way in hell I'd do that.

634
00:39:24,304 --> 00:39:25,724
That's so, so insane.

635
00:39:25,724 --> 00:39:32,645
I mean, it's nice now feeling like, you know, I went through something really fucking tough and now I'm more tough, but...

636
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:41,483
I don't know, in a lot of ways I feel like I'm weaker because now I'm afraid of something like that.

637
00:39:41,483 --> 00:39:42,844
But yeah, that was part one of...

638
00:39:42,844 --> 00:39:45,186
Part one of awful times.

639
00:39:45,186 --> 00:39:48,949
Should I go into part two, Tommy?

640
00:39:48,949 --> 00:39:52,111
Please go into part two.

641
00:39:52,111 --> 00:39:53,432
Alright, part two is the launch.

642
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:53,512
Yeah.

643
00:39:53,512 --> 00:40:01,838
So, we're part of the Game Feast, and the Game Feast was...

644
00:40:02,413 --> 00:40:04,434
us, Comic Jumper and Hydrophobia.

645
00:40:04,434 --> 00:40:06,235
And Pinball FX.

646
00:40:06,235 --> 00:40:08,496
Pinball FX, which was free.

647
00:40:08,496 --> 00:40:11,116
And we were the last game of the feast.

648
00:40:11,116 --> 00:40:17,879
We were supposed to be the main course is what it was billed as.

649
00:40:17,879 --> 00:40:18,079
Yeah.

650
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:18,319
Clever.

651
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:23,200
But we'd heard from different people at Microsoft when we asked,

652
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,441
because you know, we always want to ask, like,

653
00:40:25,441 --> 00:40:27,442
how do the students do it?

654
00:40:31,145 --> 00:40:37,490
On Skype it just popped up and said 12 minutes, bro.

655
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:42,893
So we got 12 minutes to get through the last four

656
00:40:42,893 --> 00:40:45,035
months of development.

657
00:40:45,035 --> 00:40:46,095
All right, let's go.

658
00:40:46,095 --> 00:40:49,578
So Microsoft basically told us early on, or we heard from a

659
00:40:49,578 --> 00:40:52,960
few different people there, that we were projected as

660
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,023
being on par, like selling on par as hydrophobia, which

661
00:40:57,023 --> 00:40:59,044
worried us because, you know.

662
00:40:59,451 --> 00:41:05,756
In our delusional minds, we thought that we were top dog and we were going to be the one that Microsoft was like,

663
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:07,637
oh, this game's going to kick ass.

664
00:41:07,637 --> 00:41:14,343
But whatever, we still believed in our game and we were going to push it as much as we possibly could.

665
00:41:14,343 --> 00:41:17,305
Then Hydrophobia came out and its leaderboards were grim.

666
00:41:17,305 --> 00:41:22,509
And I think in the first week, the leaderboards were like less than 10,000.

667
00:41:22,509 --> 00:41:27,493
And if Microsoft was projecting us on par with this game, we were really fucking worried

668
00:41:27,493 --> 00:41:29,014
that we were going to just bomb.

669
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:53,617
horribly. So the good thing about the Feast though is any promotion that Microsoft gives you, you get like a number one spotlight and you get an exclusive leak so there's no other games to compete with and usually get a review by Major Nelson and so on and so forth. They really push it. So they really push Hyperphobia and it got a lot of press and everything else but it got really bad reviews.

670
00:41:53,617 --> 00:41:56,739
And they had their dashboard placement and stuff.

671
00:41:56,739 --> 00:41:57,280
And then a week later...

672
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:03,232
comic jumper comes out. And the comic jumper on the leaderboards does a look, does better than

673
00:42:03,232 --> 00:42:09,073
hydrophobia. Yeah it did, it did, yeah, but still kind of, it still worried us. That's not something

674
00:42:09,073 --> 00:42:14,474
that people would be bragging about. Yeah. Again we were worried because we were projected lower

675
00:42:14,474 --> 00:42:20,455
than them. Lower than them, yeah. So at that point we were kind of like, oh well, you know,

676
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:22,896
like if shit happens, shit happens, uh, whatever.

677
00:42:23,897 --> 00:42:26,377
At least we're gonna get, you know, pushed as much as possible.

678
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,478
Yeah, we're gonna get our spotlight treatment.

679
00:42:28,478 --> 00:42:32,099
Because, like, Comic Jumper had this really nice, like, animated spotlight treatment.

680
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:36,320
And we were like, oh, okay, cool, well, you know, that's... that'll work for us, you know.

681
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:40,441
And, you know, going back to the arguments in my head,

682
00:42:40,441 --> 00:42:45,302
kind of knew what was happening... what was gonna happen next.

683
00:42:45,302 --> 00:42:50,904
Because, yeah, little people in my head told me that it was going to happen.

684
00:42:50,904 --> 00:42:51,004
So...

685
00:42:53,033 --> 00:42:59,698
Our, it's our week to launch, well, first, okay, so before our week, which was the 20th

686
00:42:59,698 --> 00:43:03,760
of October, uh, the week before that, that was supposed to be Pinball FX and we were

687
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,423
gonna be the last Game Feast game. Well, Pinball FX got pushed back, so we weren't the last.

688
00:43:08,423 --> 00:43:15,267
Um, that same week, uh, Costume Quest was announced to come out on the 20th also. And

689
00:43:15,267 --> 00:43:19,630
we're just like, what the fuck? Everybody else gets a free week, uh, except for us and

690
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,911
except for, uh, Pinball FX, because they got moved back.

691
00:43:23,258 --> 00:43:26,279
So we're like, great, we're launching next to Tim Schafer's fucking game.

692
00:43:26,279 --> 00:43:26,559
Great.

693
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:29,361
Okay, well, that's wonderful.

694
00:43:29,361 --> 00:43:32,902
At least we'll get the dash placement.

695
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:36,364
So the documentary crew was at my house,

696
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:41,546
and this is going to be some pretty awful footage for the documentary.

697
00:43:41,546 --> 00:43:46,748
But I get up, you know, I am, I guess the term would be shitting bricks,

698
00:43:46,748 --> 00:43:49,930
but something much bigger than bricks.

699
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:51,290
So I get up, it's launch day.

700
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:59,907
I turn on the Xbox, no Meat Boy. And I go, well, what the hell is this? I go on Xbox.com.

701
00:43:59,907 --> 00:44:11,277
Xbox.com is down. And I kind of go, figures. So, you know, I'm sitting there and I wrote

702
00:44:11,277 --> 00:44:14,499
an email to our producer. I was all panicked and everything. I'm like, what's the deal?

703
00:44:14,499 --> 00:44:17,862
Are you guys like, are you guys, sorry.

704
00:44:18,458 --> 00:44:21,239
Are you guys like pulling out of all this? Where is our stuff?

705
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:23,160
And you know, it didn't go up, didn't go up.

706
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,102
Finally went up halfway through our launch day.

707
00:44:26,102 --> 00:44:30,004
And it was the number four spot. It wasn't number one.

708
00:44:30,004 --> 00:44:33,306
What was the, the spooktacular sale,

709
00:44:33,306 --> 00:44:36,887
which was a whole bunch of other games that already came out, was the number one slot.

710
00:44:36,887 --> 00:44:42,010
I believe there was an ad for a Mazda 3 as the number two slot.

711
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:46,913
Because you all, you all go on Xbox and figure out what car you want to buy, right?

712
00:44:46,913 --> 00:44:47,093
Yeah.

713
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:50,042
I go and it's either that or the Honda Odyssey.

714
00:44:50,042 --> 00:44:51,202
I know that was all through our month.

715
00:44:51,202 --> 00:44:54,863
I'm like, who the fuck is buying a Honda Odyssey after looking at an ad on Xbox?

716
00:44:54,863 --> 00:44:56,023
Anyway.

717
00:44:56,023 --> 00:45:00,764
Um, but yeah, I was looking, looking at that stuff and, uh, yeah, we were number

718
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:05,886
four and we stayed number four for the entire week and we were told, we were

719
00:45:05,886 --> 00:45:09,627
told several things, we were like, well, if you, the, the better you perform.

720
00:45:09,627 --> 00:45:13,327
The, uh, you know, the, the better, the better you perform, the

721
00:45:13,327 --> 00:45:14,788
farther up you'll move in a dash.

722
00:45:15,138 --> 00:45:18,379
okay because our first day even though you know

723
00:45:18,379 --> 00:45:21,780
we only had half of our actual launch day our first day was like it was still

724
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:22,580
pretty decent

725
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:29,142
and then you know by our second day we our leader boards were bigger than

726
00:45:29,142 --> 00:45:33,304
comic jumpers and hydrophobias so we were doing like super super well

727
00:45:33,304 --> 00:45:37,725
and it just kept going and going and going and and there are metacritic score

728
00:45:37,725 --> 00:45:38,885
at that time was ninety two

729
00:45:39,192 --> 00:45:41,134
And we're like, well, we meet all the things.

730
00:45:41,134 --> 00:45:42,014
Why aren't we moved up?

731
00:45:42,014 --> 00:45:44,736
And they said, oh, well, that's different placement, blah,

732
00:45:44,736 --> 00:45:45,056
blah, blah.

733
00:45:45,056 --> 00:45:48,579
We kind of just got pushed to the side.

734
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,701
And yeah, that's basically how Xbox launch went, is the

735
00:45:51,701 --> 00:45:56,885
reason the game sold well is because of how we promoted it.

736
00:45:56,885 --> 00:46:00,368
We were the ones doing the interviews.

737
00:46:00,368 --> 00:46:02,229
We had the high Metacritic score.

738
00:46:02,229 --> 00:46:05,331
I mean, the help from Microsoft was there in a very

739
00:46:05,331 --> 00:46:06,372
limited capacity.

740
00:46:07,045 --> 00:46:10,568
I don't know if it was like that they were disappointed that the other games didn't do

741
00:46:10,568 --> 00:46:17,174
well or they just maybe wanted to like you know cut their losses or whatever but I mean

742
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:20,377
it it's not supposed to hurt your feelings because it's business but it totally fucking

743
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:26,402
hurt my feelings because you know I just killed myself me and Ed just killed ourselves trying

744
00:46:26,402 --> 00:46:31,527
to get this game done and now we're just kind of just put to the side but.

745
00:46:31,527 --> 00:46:35,210
Yeah I mean I think I mean I still think about it a lot.

746
00:46:36,178 --> 00:46:43,304
even talking, you talk to different people there and no one can give you a real straight answer but

747
00:46:43,304 --> 00:46:47,407
the only thing that I can make sense of is that since the Game Feast games did so poorly initially

748
00:46:47,407 --> 00:46:52,451
that it kind of, they kind of wanted to remove, they just wanted to push it, push it away like

749
00:46:52,451 --> 00:46:57,235
Game Feast and there's no more Game Feast and I don't know if anybody noticed but like on all of

750
00:46:57,235 --> 00:47:01,859
our ads there was nothing that tied us into Game Feast at all by the time we launched so it did

751
00:47:01,859 --> 00:47:05,262
seem like Microsoft wanted to distance itself from the Game Feast.

752
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:09,651
which was fine, but in doing so, it completely removed us.

753
00:47:09,651 --> 00:47:14,913
We tried to push into this promotion, which was to get better promotion,

754
00:47:14,913 --> 00:47:19,094
and get an exclusive launch week, and all this other stuff.

755
00:47:19,094 --> 00:47:23,875
It sounds weird to complain about it, even though we've done so well on Xbox Live,

756
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:25,936
but it was a fucking mindfuck.

757
00:47:25,936 --> 00:47:28,236
It was really confusing.

758
00:47:28,236 --> 00:47:31,337
At that point, I think we were both kind of so...

759
00:47:31,883 --> 00:47:34,845
fucked up in our heads from development that we kind of were like

760
00:47:34,845 --> 00:47:37,547
very paranoid and it almost felt like are these people out to get us?

761
00:47:37,547 --> 00:47:43,271
Are they just fucking stupid? Like what's happening here? Like what did we do to

762
00:47:43,271 --> 00:47:48,174
them? Did we do something wrong? Because there were a few times where

763
00:47:48,174 --> 00:47:51,677
we might have said things publicly that they didn't like

764
00:47:51,677 --> 00:47:54,479
and I know you just get paranoid and you think

765
00:47:54,479 --> 00:47:59,822
you know are they trying to screw us over because we did something wrong

766
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:05,864
You know, in the end, I guess you live and you learn.

767
00:48:05,864 --> 00:48:09,726
Now I know what to put in a contract before I sign it.

768
00:48:09,726 --> 00:48:10,407
Yeah, really.

769
00:48:10,407 --> 00:48:11,447
Things happen.

770
00:48:11,447 --> 00:48:14,970
I think we're running out of time, so we should probably like,

771
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:17,892
you know, just snap through these last couple of things.

772
00:48:17,892 --> 00:48:19,913
How much time do I have?

773
00:48:19,913 --> 00:48:20,233
Five? Okay.

774
00:48:20,233 --> 00:48:23,495
Five minutes, we can do this in five minutes.

775
00:48:23,495 --> 00:48:25,677
We can take questions.

776
00:48:25,677 --> 00:48:27,978
Oh, yeah, shit, we need to take questions.

777
00:48:28,643 --> 00:48:30,224
Hey, how about this?

778
00:48:30,224 --> 00:48:31,025
Want me to sum it up, Tommy?

779
00:48:31,025 --> 00:48:32,165
Yeah.

780
00:48:32,165 --> 00:48:35,987
We released on Steam, and it did better than Xbox.

781
00:48:35,987 --> 00:48:36,627
How's that?

782
00:48:36,627 --> 00:48:37,127
Yeah.

783
00:48:37,127 --> 00:48:37,307
Yeah.

784
00:48:37,307 --> 00:48:37,667
Yeah.

785
00:48:37,667 --> 00:48:37,868
Yeah.

786
00:48:37,868 --> 00:48:37,968
Yeah.

787
00:48:37,968 --> 00:48:38,168
Yeah.

788
00:48:38,168 --> 00:48:38,288
Yeah.

789
00:48:38,288 --> 00:48:38,368
Yeah.

790
00:48:38,368 --> 00:48:38,448
Yeah.

791
00:48:38,448 --> 00:48:38,608
Yeah.

792
00:48:38,608 --> 00:48:38,808
Yeah.

793
00:48:38,808 --> 00:48:39,008
Yeah.

794
00:48:39,008 --> 00:48:39,188
Yeah.

795
00:48:39,188 --> 00:48:39,308
Yeah.

796
00:48:39,308 --> 00:48:39,428
Yeah.

797
00:48:39,428 --> 00:48:39,628
Yeah.

798
00:48:39,628 --> 00:48:39,768
Yeah.

799
00:48:39,768 --> 00:48:39,929
Yeah.

800
00:48:39,929 --> 00:48:40,189
Yeah.

801
00:48:40,189 --> 00:48:40,349
Yeah.

802
00:48:40,349 --> 00:48:47,052
It did a lot better.

803
00:48:47,052 --> 00:48:52,094
Total, yes, Steam outsold Xbox.

804
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:54,142
It's much easier to update on Steam.

805
00:48:54,142 --> 00:48:56,483
Everybody should love all over Steam,

806
00:48:56,483 --> 00:48:58,063
like all nasty love all over Steam,

807
00:48:58,063 --> 00:49:00,104
because Steam is awesome.

808
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:02,205
We're closing in at like 400,000 sales now for the game.

809
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:09,027
We have retail versions coming out.

810
00:49:09,027 --> 00:49:11,688
We are, oh yeah, our WiiWare announcement,

811
00:49:11,688 --> 00:49:15,970
which we've been talking about, is, oh, I think Ed's gone.

812
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:18,211
Oh, I'm still here.

813
00:49:18,211 --> 00:49:18,451
Oh, OK.

814
00:49:18,451 --> 00:49:23,656
Our WiiWare announcement is there is no WiiWare,

815
00:49:23,656 --> 00:49:27,180
because we made a game that's too big for WiiWare,

816
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:28,221
unfortunately.

817
00:49:28,221 --> 00:49:32,205
And that really sucks, because we wanted to do WiiWare.

818
00:49:32,205 --> 00:49:33,306
It's just not in the cards.

819
00:49:33,306 --> 00:49:37,270
And I'm not going to do episodic content, so no.

820
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:47,562
We tried really hard to get a retail version, and we talked to a lot of different publishers about it,

821
00:49:47,562 --> 00:49:51,503
but nobody wants to touch retail Wii at this point in its life cycle or whatever,

822
00:49:51,503 --> 00:49:56,124
and so we weren't able to land that. But we do have 3DS development kits,

823
00:49:56,124 --> 00:50:00,265
and we are going to be working on something for the 3DS in the future.

824
00:50:00,265 --> 00:50:05,147
We don't know if that'll be Meat Boy, but you never know.

825
00:50:05,843 --> 00:50:11,646
It's, yeah, it really depends. Like, everything that we do is very whatever feels right. So

826
00:50:11,646 --> 00:50:16,568
if it feels right to do 3DS Meat Boy, we will do 3DS Meat Boy. If it doesn't, we'll do something

827
00:50:16,568 --> 00:50:20,089
and we'll try to make it super awesome because that's what's fun. You know. Oh, yeah, and

828
00:50:20,089 --> 00:50:25,652
we're still working on the editor and the portal, which should be out very, very soon.

829
00:50:25,652 --> 00:50:28,573
They're basically done. We just have to hook them up. Oh, there you are.

830
00:50:28,573 --> 00:50:33,375
Tommy's working on the editor in his hotel room.

831
00:50:34,703 --> 00:50:37,425
Yeah, actually, I'm finishing it up in my hotel room.

832
00:50:37,425 --> 00:50:39,727
This is my life now.

833
00:50:39,727 --> 00:50:41,008
Wait, there's a cover box in the back.

834
00:50:41,008 --> 00:50:41,248
Oh, yeah.

835
00:50:41,248 --> 00:50:43,410
That's the Walmart box.

836
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:43,911
Yeah.

837
00:50:43,911 --> 00:50:44,471
Woo!

838
00:50:44,471 --> 00:50:44,531
Woo!

839
00:50:44,531 --> 00:50:44,872
Woo!

840
00:50:44,872 --> 00:50:45,092
Woo!

841
00:50:45,092 --> 00:50:45,612
Woo!

842
00:50:45,612 --> 00:50:46,033
Woo!

843
00:50:46,033 --> 00:50:46,393
Woo!

844
00:50:46,393 --> 00:50:46,613
Woo!

845
00:50:46,613 --> 00:50:46,693
Woo!

846
00:50:46,693 --> 00:50:46,773
Woo!

847
00:50:46,773 --> 00:50:47,033
Woo!

848
00:50:47,033 --> 00:50:47,314
Woo!

849
00:50:47,314 --> 00:50:47,554
Woo!

850
00:50:47,554 --> 00:50:47,614
Woo!

851
00:50:47,614 --> 00:50:49,175
Woo!

852
00:50:49,175 --> 00:50:54,780
Woo!

853
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:55,400
Woo!

854
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,782
Woo!

855
00:50:57,782 --> 00:50:58,103
Woo!

856
00:50:58,103 --> 00:50:58,303
Woo!

857
00:50:58,303 --> 00:50:58,683
Woo!

858
00:50:58,683 --> 00:50:59,724
Woo!

859
00:50:59,724 --> 00:50:59,884
Woo!

860
00:50:59,884 --> 00:51:00,124
Woo!

861
00:51:00,124 --> 00:51:01,566
Woo!

862
00:51:01,566 --> 00:51:01,786
Woo!

863
00:51:01,786 --> 00:51:02,126
Woo!

864
00:51:02,126 --> 00:51:02,667
Woo!

865
00:51:02,667 --> 00:51:02,887
Woo!

866
00:51:02,887 --> 00:51:02,947
Woo!

867
00:51:02,947 --> 00:51:03,127
Woo!

868
00:51:03,127 --> 00:51:03,187
Woo!

869
00:51:03,187 --> 00:51:03,287
Woo!

870
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:06,487
So they better be good.

871
00:51:06,487 --> 00:51:09,948
Yes, at the mic person.

872
00:51:09,948 --> 00:51:11,289
Oh, sorry.

873
00:51:11,289 --> 00:51:12,149
Yeah.

874
00:51:12,149 --> 00:51:14,510
Well, great job, by the way, guys.

875
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:15,290
I love the game.

876
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:16,491
Thank you.

877
00:51:16,491 --> 00:51:22,012
When approaching digital distribution markets,

878
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:23,513
I noticed a lot of them are private,

879
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:26,874
so sales figures and such aren't easily available.

880
00:51:26,874 --> 00:51:30,315
How did you guys approach making your contracts,

881
00:51:30,315 --> 00:51:32,176
business plans, and so on for Super Meat Boy,

882
00:51:32,176 --> 00:51:34,557
given that a lot of the information isn't public?

883
00:51:35,028 --> 00:51:40,551
for like say Xbox Live sales, revenue splits and so on?

884
00:51:40,551 --> 00:51:46,255
Oh, um, most, most like, most like revenue splits and everything are just sort of written

885
00:51:46,255 --> 00:51:50,798
in. I mean, and like we said, we don't have any clout because, you know, we hadn't made

886
00:51:50,798 --> 00:51:55,241
anything so, uh, we just kind of took what they gave us, uh, with everybody. Um, yeah,

887
00:51:55,241 --> 00:52:02,786
I mean that's the, and the way we sort of just approached the, the Microsoft exclusivity

888
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:03,146
stuff.

889
00:52:03,597 --> 00:52:10,942
is we just kind of pushed it to see what we could get away with.

890
00:52:10,942 --> 00:52:18,887
And I mean, it was really, honestly, it's just kind of a lot of dumb luck,

891
00:52:18,887 --> 00:52:23,190
as far as like the exclusivity term and everything, but...

892
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:26,132
Yeah, we just kind of played everything by ear.

893
00:52:26,132 --> 00:52:27,953
I know it's not the best advice, but...

894
00:52:27,953 --> 00:52:29,534
But that's kind of how we work, as you can tell from the speech.

895
00:52:29,534 --> 00:52:32,175
Thank you.

896
00:52:32,175 --> 00:52:32,716
Thanks.

897
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:32,896
Yes.

898
00:52:32,896 --> 00:52:33,116
Oh, hey.

899
00:52:33,547 --> 00:52:34,448
Oh.

900
00:52:34,448 --> 00:52:35,389
Yeah, no worries.

901
00:52:35,389 --> 00:52:37,210
A little confusing with two mics.

902
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:41,993
So there's a lot more pain and agony behind your development process than I could have

903
00:52:41,993 --> 00:52:43,134
possibly imagined.

904
00:52:43,134 --> 00:52:46,937
And I'm just curious, looking forward, if you have any thoughts on how to mitigate that

905
00:52:46,937 --> 00:52:48,438
in the future.

906
00:52:48,438 --> 00:52:53,482
I think the only way we can actually mitigate that kind of stuff is through experience.

907
00:52:53,482 --> 00:52:56,744
We won't have money troubles this next game.

908
00:52:56,744 --> 00:52:57,485
And we...

909
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:04,243
Admittedly, a lot of the troubles that we had were our fault and, you know, just stuff

910
00:53:04,243 --> 00:53:11,448
like getting, I guess, like, too wrapped up in the game and everything, but that's something

911
00:53:11,448 --> 00:53:14,110
we're actually not going to fix because I feel that's what made the game great, but

912
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:20,755
the only way to, like, fix the stress and all of that is to, I mean, we're not going

913
00:53:20,755 --> 00:53:24,498
to kill ourselves to get into a promotion next time, that's for sure, and that will

914
00:53:24,498 --> 00:53:26,539
save a lot of heartache and a lot of...

915
00:53:26,832 --> 00:53:32,316
you know, just pressure that's put onto us. But yeah, I mean, experience, you know, just

916
00:53:32,316 --> 00:53:37,099
sort of going through it. And I mean, we didn't bite off more than we could chew, and that

917
00:53:37,099 --> 00:53:42,223
was a good thing. And I think that's something that makes people, that sort of destroys people

918
00:53:42,223 --> 00:53:47,306
sometimes. So, I mean, if you are very much within your own limits, then you'll be fine.

919
00:53:47,306 --> 00:53:52,610
We were just in a compressed timeline within our limits that was, you know, not through

920
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:53,691
our doing exactly.

921
00:53:54,153 --> 00:53:54,753
Awesome, thanks.

922
00:53:54,753 --> 00:53:59,795
Yeah, I mean the majority of development was really, really fun and really, really smooth.

923
00:53:59,795 --> 00:54:02,836
Like, the only negatives were the things that we mentioned.

924
00:54:02,836 --> 00:54:05,697
You know, that was only a good two weeks in the building.

925
00:54:05,697 --> 00:54:08,979
Oh, and for the record, working with Microsoft was...

926
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:12,340
Working with the creative side of Microsoft was great.

927
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:16,322
It was the... I was thinking about it in the car.

928
00:54:16,322 --> 00:54:18,463
The thing that sucked about it...

929
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:20,924
Everybody that we talked to were great.

930
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:23,445
The people that we could not talk to were the people that were the problem.

931
00:54:24,005 --> 00:54:26,047
So everyone we worked with was wonderful.

932
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:30,131
Everyone that was making decisions, not so much.

933
00:54:30,131 --> 00:54:33,134
Yeah, I do think it would be the only negative

934
00:54:33,134 --> 00:54:37,217
that we experienced with Microsoft was just

935
00:54:37,217 --> 00:54:38,038
We got to cut it, Ed.

936
00:54:38,038 --> 00:54:39,019
We're like way over.

937
00:54:39,019 --> 00:54:39,360
Oh, whatever.

938
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:43,424
Make games.

939
00:54:43,424 --> 00:54:44,845
Yeah, make games.

940
00:54:44,845 --> 00:54:45,425
There.

941
00:54:56,485 --> 00:55:12,094
There's the coffee break and be back in 15 minutes or more like 12.

942
00:55:55,849 --> 00:55:58,370
Thank you.

943
00:56:16,624 --> 00:56:32,114
Thank you very much.

944
00:56:36,078 --> 00:56:37,900
I've got another stuff too.

945
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:38,961
Oh, yeah.

946
00:56:38,961 --> 00:56:39,381
Watch out.

947
00:56:39,381 --> 00:56:41,404
Lots of my stuff.

948
00:56:41,404 --> 00:56:43,246
We're going to play.

949
00:56:43,246 --> 00:56:46,169
Now I'm going to give them the art.

950
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:46,329
Yeah.

951
00:56:46,329 --> 00:56:47,371
Oh, my God.

952
00:56:47,371 --> 00:56:49,273
We're going to play.

953
00:56:49,273 --> 00:56:50,214
We're going to play.

954
00:56:50,214 --> 00:56:51,295
All right.

955
00:56:51,295 --> 00:56:52,436
So let's try this.

956
00:56:52,436 --> 00:56:52,837
Yeah.

957
00:56:52,837 --> 00:56:53,137
Yeah.

958
00:56:53,137 --> 00:56:53,197
OK.

959
00:56:53,197 --> 00:56:54,619
You have to get that.

960
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:54,859
Yeah.

961
00:56:54,859 --> 00:56:55,580
You have to get that.

962
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:56,381
Like we were playing.

963
00:56:57,348 --> 00:57:00,291
Aha, thank you, awesome.

964
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:03,574
And that's also my website.

965
00:57:03,574 --> 00:57:08,599
Wow, did you take someone else's business card and scratch it up?

966
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:09,320
I did, my boyfriend.

967
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,101
That's awesome.

968
00:57:10,101 --> 00:57:11,022
Thank you.

969
00:57:20,957 --> 00:57:39,991
Yeah.

970
00:57:44,414 --> 00:58:03,701
I'll be back. I'm just trying to go to the bathroom.
