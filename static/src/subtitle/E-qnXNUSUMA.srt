1
00:00:05,826 --> 00:00:10,548
All right. Oh, GDC, the Narrative Summit is the best part of the GDC.

2
00:00:10,548 --> 00:00:16,790
And the GDC is the best part of the year. I'm so excited to be here.

3
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,891
My 23rd GDC.

4
00:00:18,891 --> 00:00:27,214
Okay, so today I was going to give a talk about the nature of order in game narrative.

5
00:00:27,214 --> 00:00:32,096
And to understand what that means, I need to take you into the future.

6
00:00:32,096 --> 00:00:34,117
Five years forward? Ten years forward? No.

7
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:35,956
to the year 2500.

8
00:00:35,956 --> 00:00:40,817
All right, we're going to go to the year 2500,

9
00:00:40,817 --> 00:00:43,298
and we're going to look back.

10
00:00:43,298 --> 00:00:46,779
We're going to look way, way back all the way

11
00:00:46,779 --> 00:00:47,099
to the 20th century.

12
00:00:47,099 --> 00:00:49,379
And I'll ask you the question, who

13
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,961
will be remembered from the 20th century in the year 2500?

14
00:00:53,961 --> 00:01:00,502
I'm going to make the argument that the two people who

15
00:01:00,502 --> 00:01:01,903
will be most remembered.

16
00:01:02,394 --> 00:01:05,356
from the 20th century in the year 2500.

17
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:06,756
First will be Albert Einstein,

18
00:01:06,756 --> 00:01:12,199
who redefined the way we think about the relationship between space and time.

19
00:01:12,199 --> 00:01:14,740
And the second person, who will be most remembered,

20
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,801
will be Christopher Alexander,

21
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:20,883
who redefined how we think about the relationship between space and mind.

22
00:01:20,883 --> 00:01:22,724
Now I know a lot of people are thinking,

23
00:01:22,724 --> 00:01:25,206
Shell, what's the relationship between mind and space?

24
00:01:25,206 --> 00:01:26,426
Well, I think the answer is,

25
00:01:26,426 --> 00:01:26,986
the answer is,

26
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:28,627
the answer is,

27
00:01:28,627 --> 00:01:28,867
the answer is,

28
00:01:28,867 --> 00:01:29,128
the answer is,

29
00:01:29,128 --> 00:01:30,228
the answer is,

30
00:01:30,228 --> 00:01:30,748
the answer is,

31
00:01:30,748 --> 00:01:32,069
the answer is,

32
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,390
What are you talking about?

33
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,391
How can it be that one of the most remembered people

34
00:01:37,391 --> 00:01:39,131
is someone who I've never even heard of?

35
00:01:39,131 --> 00:01:42,872
And I say, well, it's not uncommon, right?

36
00:01:42,872 --> 00:01:45,332
Like, look at all of these people.

37
00:01:45,332 --> 00:01:48,093
None of them were appreciated when they were alive.

38
00:01:48,093 --> 00:01:54,074
All of them died in obscurity, many of them in poverty.

39
00:01:54,074 --> 00:01:57,875
So why would we think that there aren't people among us

40
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:01,235
now who are going to be celebrated?

41
00:02:01,777 --> 00:02:06,238
long after us because we're unable to appreciate the gifts

42
00:02:06,238 --> 00:02:08,339
that they brought us while they were here.

43
00:02:08,339 --> 00:02:13,360
And I think that Christopher Alexander is one of those people.

44
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,962
The first time I found out about Christopher Alexander was

45
00:02:18,962 --> 00:02:21,222
when I was working at Disney.

46
00:02:21,222 --> 00:02:25,663
As you can imagine, Disney Imagineering has a fabulous library called the IRC,

47
00:02:25,663 --> 00:02:30,185
and I made it very much my habit to go to the IRC all the time.

48
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:33,347
Every Monday I would go and take out a new book.

49
00:02:33,347 --> 00:02:36,287
I would always just get some new book.

50
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:40,048
And one time I happened to see this weird little book

51
00:02:40,048 --> 00:02:44,029
on a shelf, The Timeless Way of Building.

52
00:02:44,029 --> 00:02:45,490
And I thought, I wonder what that means.

53
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,610
I don't understand what that is.

54
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,891
And I opened it up to a random page and I find these words.

55
00:02:51,891 --> 00:02:56,172
Each one of us has somewhere in his heart the dream

56
00:02:56,172 --> 00:02:58,793
to make a living world a universe.

57
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,110
And I thought, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, exactly right.

58
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,971
Yes, this, and nothing but this, right?

59
00:03:04,971 --> 00:03:09,152
And so I eagerly took this book home to see what it was

60
00:03:09,152 --> 00:03:10,112
and started reading it.

61
00:03:10,112 --> 00:03:17,053
And so I'll read you from a little of it right now.

62
00:03:17,053 --> 00:03:20,314
There is one timeless way of building.

63
00:03:20,314 --> 00:03:23,314
It is thousands of years old and the same today

64
00:03:23,314 --> 00:03:24,555
as it has always been.

65
00:03:25,462 --> 00:03:30,223
The great traditional buildings of the past, the villages and tents and temples in which

66
00:03:30,223 --> 00:03:35,084
man feels at home, have always been made by people who were very close to the center of

67
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:35,464
this way.

68
00:03:35,464 --> 00:03:42,386
It is not possible to make great buildings or great towns, beautiful places, places where

69
00:03:42,386 --> 00:03:49,548
you feel yourself, places where you feel alive, except by following this way.

70
00:03:49,548 --> 00:03:53,248
And as you will see, this way will lead anyone who looks for it.

71
00:03:53,753 --> 00:03:59,415
to buildings which are themselves as ancient in their form as the trees and hills and as

72
00:03:59,415 --> 00:04:00,996
our faces are.

73
00:04:00,996 --> 00:04:07,338
It is so powerful and fundamental that with its help you can make any building in the

74
00:04:07,338 --> 00:04:11,939
world as beautiful as any place that you have ever seen."

75
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:14,440
So that's a powerful claim.

76
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,861
And so how do we get there?

77
00:04:16,861 --> 00:04:21,162
What is the timeless way of building?

78
00:04:21,162 --> 00:04:22,803
Well Alexander's

79
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:37,950
idea is that the way that we look at space, the wisest way to look at it is with our hearts.

80
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:45,152
And the idea being that things that are wonderful and beautiful, be they places or spaces or

81
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:52,834
objects or experiences, they have certain wonderful feelings.

82
00:04:53,140 --> 00:05:00,783
He refers to the quality of these things that are good and right and just you know it, this is how things should be.

83
00:05:00,783 --> 00:05:05,685
He refers to this quality as the quality without a name.

84
00:05:05,685 --> 00:05:11,888
Now the quality may not have a name, but it does have certain aspects.

85
00:05:11,888 --> 00:05:18,471
So let's talk about the aspects that he says this quality has.

86
00:05:18,471 --> 00:05:19,632
So he talks about

87
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:27,905
things and places that feel right as feeling alive and having a living quality to them.

88
00:05:27,905 --> 00:05:31,628
Now I know I experienced this when I played Ultima online.

89
00:05:31,628 --> 00:05:36,250
I played that game quite a bit and the place I used to hang out was the town of Yu.

90
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,532
Yu is just kind of a small town, kind of in the north.

91
00:05:38,532 --> 00:05:42,054
And you see there's a map of the town there from above.

92
00:05:42,054 --> 00:05:47,377
You can see up there there's a there's a castle up there and there's there's

93
00:05:47,768 --> 00:05:51,271
There's a town center and there's some things out on an island.

94
00:05:51,271 --> 00:05:53,452
There's a bunch of things there.

95
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:58,095
But in truth, there were only a small fraction of this place felt alive.

96
00:05:58,095 --> 00:06:00,037
I'll show you where.

97
00:06:00,037 --> 00:06:02,158
Those yellow lines.

98
00:06:02,158 --> 00:06:05,040
Anything on those yellow lines felt alive.

99
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,982
Everything else felt dead and useless.

100
00:06:07,982 --> 00:06:08,282
Okay?

101
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:11,972
Now you see that part where there's sort of a little lumpy star at the top?

102
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,993
That was where the bank was.

103
00:06:13,993 --> 00:06:16,034
That was where you stored all your objects.

104
00:06:16,034 --> 00:06:18,636
You had to store your objects there.

105
00:06:18,636 --> 00:06:20,938
And you see that big fan of yellow lines at the top?

106
00:06:20,938 --> 00:06:22,479
That was where the monsters were.

107
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,900
You would go up and fight monsters,

108
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,882
and then you would return back to this little town and put things in the bank.

109
00:06:26,882 --> 00:06:30,085
So there was this constant flow of people back and forth.

110
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:33,970
Now what about those other two lines, that one to the right?

111
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,472
That went to a teleport gate, which of course could take you

112
00:06:36,472 --> 00:06:38,614
anywhere in the world, which was really useful.

113
00:06:38,614 --> 00:06:40,676
And then the line going down south was for people who

114
00:06:40,676 --> 00:06:43,058
wanted to take the long walk and go and visit other towns.

115
00:06:43,058 --> 00:06:45,961
No one ever went anywhere else.

116
00:06:45,961 --> 00:06:47,483
No one went to the town square.

117
00:06:47,483 --> 00:06:48,263
No one went to the island.

118
00:06:48,263 --> 00:06:49,545
No one went to the other places.

119
00:06:49,988 --> 00:06:55,350
But this little network of things felt totally alive.

120
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,550
And most particularly, that junction, that kind of

121
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,331
southern junction where those lines came together.

122
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:02,572
If you wanted to just hang out and see people come and go

123
00:07:02,572 --> 00:07:05,252
and know what was going on, you would hang out there.

124
00:07:05,252 --> 00:07:07,093
And it felt wonderful.

125
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,393
And it felt alive.

126
00:07:08,393 --> 00:07:10,053
So another property that he talks about is

127
00:07:10,053 --> 00:07:10,874
things feeling whole.

128
00:07:10,874 --> 00:07:13,834
Apologize for the scene down the middle here.

129
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:15,715
I scanned this right out of the book.

130
00:07:15,715 --> 00:07:17,475
Places that.

131
00:07:18,547 --> 00:07:22,469
There are sometimes places that feel whole, they feel like they don't need anything else.

132
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:25,130
They have everything that they need.

133
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:29,492
Other times, things feel comfortable.

134
00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:33,714
And I like the way Alexander talks about the idea of comfort.

135
00:07:33,714 --> 00:07:40,597
The word comfortable is more profound than people usually realize.

136
00:07:40,597 --> 00:07:45,859
The mystery of genuine comfort goes far beyond the simple idea that the word first seems

137
00:07:45,859 --> 00:07:46,019
to mean.

138
00:07:46,868 --> 00:07:51,690
Places which are comfortable are comfortable because they have no inner contradictions,

139
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:55,632
because there is no little restlessness disturbing them.

140
00:07:55,632 --> 00:08:01,255
Imagine yourself on a winter afternoon with a pot of tea, a book, a reading light,

141
00:08:01,255 --> 00:08:04,737
and two or three large pillows to lean back against.

142
00:08:04,737 --> 00:08:07,318
Now make yourself comfortable.

143
00:08:07,318 --> 00:08:11,360
Not in some way which you can show to other people and say how much you like it.

144
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,642
I mean so that you really like it for yourself.

145
00:08:15,565 --> 00:08:19,988
You put the tea where you can reach it, but in a place where you can't possibly knock it over.

146
00:08:19,988 --> 00:08:23,831
You pull the light down to shine on the book, but not too brightly,

147
00:08:23,831 --> 00:08:26,453
and so that you can't see the naked bulb.

148
00:08:26,453 --> 00:08:30,576
You put the cushions behind you and place them carefully, one by one,

149
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:34,419
just where you want them, to support your back, your neck, your arm,

150
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:41,305
so that you are supported just comfortably, just as you want to sip your tea and read and dream.

151
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:49,347
When you take the trouble to do all that, and you do it carefully, with much attention,

152
00:08:49,347 --> 00:08:51,428
then it may begin to have the quality which has no name.

153
00:08:51,428 --> 00:08:57,151
So he also talks about things feeling free, so that they could be anything that they wanted

154
00:08:57,151 --> 00:09:02,554
to, but at the same time, these things have a feeling of exactness, that they are just

155
00:09:02,554 --> 00:09:06,297
so, that if you change them, even just a little bit, that might ruin them.

156
00:09:07,518 --> 00:09:09,139
They're also egoless.

157
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:11,019
They're not about someone showing off.

158
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:14,021
They're not about someone saying, look how amazing I am.

159
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:18,903
They just are for themselves and for the people who use them.

160
00:09:18,903 --> 00:09:22,144
And then very importantly, he talks about them

161
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,766
having an eternal quality.

162
00:09:24,766 --> 00:09:30,148
And I really like the way that he describes this.

163
00:09:30,148 --> 00:09:33,029
I once saw a simple fish pond in a Japanese village,

164
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:35,290
which was perhaps eternal.

165
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,891
A farmer made it for his farm.

166
00:09:37,403 --> 00:09:42,345
The pond was a simple rectangle, about six feet wide and eight feet long,

167
00:09:42,345 --> 00:09:45,087
opening off a little irrigation stream.

168
00:09:45,087 --> 00:09:48,568
At the end, a bush of flowers hung over the water.

169
00:09:48,568 --> 00:09:51,429
At the other end, under the water, was a circle of wood,

170
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:54,590
its top perhaps 12 inches below the surface of the water.

171
00:09:54,590 --> 00:10:00,433
In the pond were eight great ancient carp, each maybe 18 inches long,

172
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,174
orange, gold, purple, and black.

173
00:10:03,174 --> 00:10:05,275
The oldest one had been there 80 years.

174
00:10:05,686 --> 00:10:10,247
The eight fish swam slowly, slowly in circles,

175
00:10:10,247 --> 00:10:12,908
often within the wooden circle.

176
00:10:12,908 --> 00:10:15,369
The whole world was within that pond.

177
00:10:15,369 --> 00:10:19,070
Every day the farmer sat by it for a few minutes.

178
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:23,452
I was there only one day, and I sat by it all afternoon.

179
00:10:23,452 --> 00:10:26,873
Even now, I cannot think of it without tears.

180
00:10:26,873 --> 00:10:30,654
Those ancient fish had been swimming slowly

181
00:10:30,654 --> 00:10:33,355
in that pond for 80 years.

182
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:39,652
It was so true to the nature of the fish and the flowers and the water and the farmers

183
00:10:39,652 --> 00:10:46,018
that it had sustained itself for all that time, endlessly repeating, always different.

184
00:10:46,018 --> 00:10:52,503
There is no degree of wholeness or reality which can be reached beyond that simple pond."

185
00:10:52,503 --> 00:10:56,146
And of course, we all want to make things that last.

186
00:10:56,146 --> 00:11:00,810
Things that last are the things that are good and have the right qualities.

187
00:11:03,507 --> 00:11:06,549
So how do we get to all of these qualities?

188
00:11:06,549 --> 00:11:09,371
And that's what the Timeless Way book is about.

189
00:11:09,371 --> 00:11:12,232
And the Timeless Way is a simple idea.

190
00:11:12,232 --> 00:11:15,434
All you do is you do what feels right,

191
00:11:15,434 --> 00:11:17,595
and you test it and you change it

192
00:11:17,595 --> 00:11:20,577
until all imperfection is gone.

193
00:11:20,577 --> 00:11:23,859
So here's an example where he talks about building a lab.

194
00:11:23,859 --> 00:11:27,181
Suppose you have built a small laboratory building.

195
00:11:27,181 --> 00:11:29,062
It has a kitchen, a library, four labs,

196
00:11:29,062 --> 00:11:29,903
and a main entrance.

197
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:34,645
You want to add a fifth laboratory to it because you need more space.

198
00:11:34,645 --> 00:11:36,926
Don't look for the best place right away.

199
00:11:36,926 --> 00:11:40,907
First, look at the existing building and see what's wrong with it.

200
00:11:40,907 --> 00:11:45,589
There is a path where tin cans collect, a tree which is a beautiful tree,

201
00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:47,149
but somehow no one uses it.

202
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:50,550
One of the four labs is always empty.

203
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:53,971
There's nothing obviously wrong with it, but somehow no one ever goes there.

204
00:11:53,971 --> 00:11:57,012
The main entrance has no places to sit comfortably.

205
00:11:57,012 --> 00:12:00,173
The earth around one corner of the building is being eroded.

206
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:05,751
Now look at all these things which are wrong and build the fifth lab in such a way that

207
00:12:05,751 --> 00:12:12,777
it takes care of all these problems and also does for itself what it will have to do.

208
00:12:12,777 --> 00:12:13,037
Right?

209
00:12:13,037 --> 00:12:21,784
So what he's really saying here, the fundamental idea is this is play testing and agile development.

210
00:12:21,784 --> 00:12:26,187
One of the things Alexander's famous for, he often builds campuses, college campuses

211
00:12:26,187 --> 00:12:26,788
and the thing.

212
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,930
And we've all seen situations like this.

213
00:12:30,418 --> 00:12:32,240
campuses, right?

214
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,042
The architect did not understand where people really

215
00:12:35,042 --> 00:12:37,043
wanted to go when they built this.

216
00:12:37,043 --> 00:12:39,305
And so Alexander's method was, no, I'm not going to lay down

217
00:12:39,305 --> 00:12:42,407
sidewalks, I'm just going to leave it all grass.

218
00:12:42,407 --> 00:12:44,449
And I will see, I'll come back two years later, I'll see

219
00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:47,131
where everyone did walk, and then I'll pave that.

220
00:12:47,131 --> 00:12:51,074
And that's the notion of the timeless way of building.

221
00:12:51,074 --> 00:12:55,357
You come up with an idea for what feels right, you see how

222
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,238
people use it, and then you adjust.

223
00:12:57,827 --> 00:12:59,427
And you make it work.

224
00:12:59,427 --> 00:13:01,528
Part of what he recommends, for example, it sounds sort

225
00:13:01,528 --> 00:13:04,068
of crazy, but building buildings out of cardboard.

226
00:13:04,068 --> 00:13:07,129
Probably doesn't sound crazy to Sean Patton, but building

227
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:10,110
actual buildings out of cardboard, partly so that you

228
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:13,791
can see where the sun is going to fall into the buildings.

229
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,732
And then once you feel good about your cardboard one, then,

230
00:13:16,732 --> 00:13:18,912
only then, build a real building.

231
00:13:18,912 --> 00:13:22,473
So there's a companion volume with The Timeless Way of

232
00:13:22,473 --> 00:13:24,374
Building, which is much better known.

233
00:13:24,374 --> 00:13:26,314
It's a book called The Pattern Language.

234
00:13:26,896 --> 00:13:32,178
Because after having established the right process for creating living places, Alexander

235
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:36,140
got together with a bunch of people and said, all right, let's talk about, let's see if

236
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:42,043
we can enumerate the architectural patterns that actually feel alive and feel like they

237
00:13:42,043 --> 00:13:43,564
have these qualities.

238
00:13:43,564 --> 00:13:45,605
So how many of these are there?

239
00:13:45,605 --> 00:13:47,045
Are there 10?

240
00:13:47,045 --> 00:13:47,646
Are there 15?

241
00:13:47,646 --> 00:13:49,526
No, there's 253.

242
00:13:49,526 --> 00:13:52,448
And I've enumerated them all here for you.

243
00:13:52,448 --> 00:13:56,530
We won't have time to go through them all, but we'll talk about some of them.

244
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,021
So he starts out with big patterns, like pattern four is agricultural valleys, right?

245
00:14:02,021 --> 00:14:06,723
That we need those in order to live in a healthy society.

246
00:14:06,723 --> 00:14:10,004
A mosaic of subcultures, so talking about the way different things interconnect within

247
00:14:10,004 --> 00:14:10,184
a city.

248
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:15,966
Neighborhoods having boundaries being an important pattern, that neighborhoods that just blend

249
00:14:15,966 --> 00:14:20,947
and flow into each other with no boundary, that's a certain problem.

250
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:24,849
Then the patterns start to get a little more intimate.

251
00:14:24,849 --> 00:14:26,369
Pattern 68, connected play.

252
00:14:26,883 --> 00:14:29,824
There needs to be a way for kids to get together to play.

253
00:14:29,824 --> 00:14:31,085
I like his comment here.

254
00:14:31,085 --> 00:14:33,265
If children don't play enough with other children

255
00:14:33,265 --> 00:14:35,006
during the first five years of life,

256
00:14:35,006 --> 00:14:36,206
there is a great chance that they

257
00:14:36,206 --> 00:14:40,767
will have some kind of mental illness later in their lives.

258
00:14:40,767 --> 00:14:42,828
And what better cure for that than Pattern 73,

259
00:14:42,828 --> 00:14:45,769
Adventure Playground?

260
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:47,209
Yes.

261
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:48,329
That's a good one.

262
00:14:48,329 --> 00:14:51,550
He talks about, he starts talking about buildings.

263
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,430
I like this idea.

264
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,291
Courtyards which live.

265
00:14:54,957 --> 00:14:57,158
And I love his counter example here.

266
00:14:57,158 --> 00:15:00,060
The courtyards built in modern buildings are very often dead.

267
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,362
They are intended to be private open spaces for people to use,

268
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:07,404
but they end up unused, full of gravel and abstract sculptures.

269
00:15:07,404 --> 00:15:12,066
But then he gives examples of courtyards that feel really alive,

270
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:14,007
and he does an analysis of what is it.

271
00:15:14,007 --> 00:15:16,169
And he points out it's not money.

272
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:18,070
It's not that these are expensive places.

273
00:15:18,645 --> 00:15:21,306
But it has to do with the way people flow through them,

274
00:15:21,306 --> 00:15:22,906
the views in and out of them.

275
00:15:22,906 --> 00:15:26,327
Is it comfortable to sit there and to be there?

276
00:15:26,327 --> 00:15:29,528
Is this a nexus of where there are things to look at?

277
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:33,169
Are there natural elements as well as man-made elements here?

278
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:35,750
Here's a pattern that should be near and dear

279
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,910
to the heart of any game designer, paths and goals.

280
00:15:39,584 --> 00:15:41,706
And you'll see he has this little fountain.

281
00:15:41,706 --> 00:15:43,848
When you're talking about paths, that seems strange.

282
00:15:43,848 --> 00:15:47,190
But what he points out is that it is a bad path that

283
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,432
doesn't give you a goal that you're moving toward.

284
00:15:49,432 --> 00:15:53,095
And that good path design has a series of little landmarks

285
00:15:53,095 --> 00:15:55,577
where you're looking forward to getting to this one, and

286
00:15:55,577 --> 00:15:57,899
then getting to that one, and getting to the next one.

287
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:00,141
Because that's the nature of walking.

288
00:16:00,141 --> 00:16:03,764
As he says, the process of walking is far more subtle

289
00:16:03,764 --> 00:16:05,565
than one might imagine.

290
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,267
And of course, we do this in games all the time.

291
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:08,348
But why not do this?

292
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:11,140
in the real world.

293
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,641
Light on two sides of every room.

294
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:16,682
It's just something that we feel better about.

295
00:16:16,682 --> 00:16:18,662
Another one, ceiling height variety.

296
00:16:18,662 --> 00:16:22,224
When all ceilings are the same height, it has a bad feeling for us.

297
00:16:22,224 --> 00:16:24,764
When they change, it has a good feeling.

298
00:16:24,764 --> 00:16:34,048
And then finally, he wraps it up on page 1064 with pattern 253, the most intimate of all,

299
00:16:34,048 --> 00:16:36,668
things from your life.

300
00:16:38,383 --> 00:16:39,923
So this book was very influential.

301
00:16:39,923 --> 00:16:42,685
It caused a big stir in the architecture world.

302
00:16:42,685 --> 00:16:44,705
Some people liked it, some people didn't like it.

303
00:16:44,705 --> 00:16:47,827
But many people outside the architecture world

304
00:16:47,827 --> 00:16:48,707
were influenced by it.

305
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:51,588
If you've ever heard of the idea of software design patterns,

306
00:16:51,588 --> 00:16:53,889
the people who started that movement were very much

307
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:57,191
influenced by Alexander's book, A Pattern Language.

308
00:16:57,191 --> 00:17:00,032
And I have to say, I don't think I would have written

309
00:17:00,032 --> 00:17:02,253
Art of Game Design with my lenses approach of 100 lenses

310
00:17:02,253 --> 00:17:04,374
if I had not read Pattern Language.

311
00:17:04,374 --> 00:17:05,614
It definitely showed me.

312
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,000
that that was a good way to do it.

313
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,982
In fact, I got double benefit because at the time I was

314
00:17:08,982 --> 00:17:11,203
reading pattern language, I was wrestling with how to

315
00:17:11,203 --> 00:17:12,584
layout the map for Toontown Online.

316
00:17:12,584 --> 00:17:15,185
And after I read it, I'm like, oh, OK, paths, neighborhoods

317
00:17:15,185 --> 00:17:18,087
with boundaries, central hubs.

318
00:17:18,087 --> 00:17:20,288
And I just understood how you make.

319
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,663
a good neighborhood. And I wasn't the only one. Will Wright read pattern language and

320
00:17:24,663 --> 00:17:29,109
he made SimCity very much. He talks about how he was inspired by pattern language to

321
00:17:29,109 --> 00:17:34,576
make SimCity. And if you play The Sims and you use patterns from the book, if you put

322
00:17:34,576 --> 00:17:39,061
lights on two sides of a room, the characters are happier. He, like, programmed the patterns

323
00:17:39,061 --> 00:17:40,163
right into the game.

324
00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:45,633
Now, a lot of people have read and know pattern language, and that's usually all most people

325
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:51,277
know about Christopher Alexander, but I contend that that was far from his greatest work.

326
00:17:51,277 --> 00:17:57,482
So he did that stuff back in the 70s, and he was not satisfied with what he'd found

327
00:17:57,482 --> 00:17:57,923
there.

328
00:17:57,923 --> 00:18:04,348
He felt good about these patterns, but he wanted to break it down and get to something

329
00:18:04,348 --> 00:18:05,429
more fundamental.

330
00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:09,492
And so later, he wrote these other books, this series of four books.

331
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:10,937
which are called the nature of order.

332
00:18:10,937 --> 00:18:17,843
He wanted to break things down into more fundamental components, and he wanted to truly understand

333
00:18:17,843 --> 00:18:19,965
the quality that has no name.

334
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:23,908
And in these later books, he gets bolder and he gives it a name.

335
00:18:23,908 --> 00:18:26,730
And he says that quality is life.

336
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,633
And he argues that life isn't what we think it is.

337
00:18:29,633 --> 00:18:31,815
We think of just living things.

338
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:36,563
organic things as what life is. And he argues that life is something more

339
00:18:36,563 --> 00:18:41,206
fundamental to the universe than that. Life as we know it has those properties.

340
00:18:41,206 --> 00:18:45,910
That's why it persists. That is why it stays. But that's not the only kind of

341
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:53,195
life in the universe. His big revelation is that what makes things stay are

342
00:18:53,195 --> 00:18:57,238
things that have centers. And that anything that has structure and

343
00:18:57,238 --> 00:19:00,921
persists and stays is a series of overlapping centers.

344
00:19:01,314 --> 00:19:04,495
Now that's a deep idea and kind of hard to grasp.

345
00:19:04,495 --> 00:19:10,818
And what he does is he breaks it down to a series of 15 patterns that create these centers.

346
00:19:10,818 --> 00:19:14,599
So he breaks it down to these 15 properties.

347
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:22,022
And he argues that anything in the universe that stays and persists has these 15 properties.

348
00:19:22,022 --> 00:19:24,583
Every building, every tool we create.

349
00:19:25,283 --> 00:19:26,684
But also things in nature.

350
00:19:26,684 --> 00:19:28,805
Living things have these properties.

351
00:19:28,805 --> 00:19:32,207
But also other things, atoms and molecules

352
00:19:32,207 --> 00:19:33,468
all have these properties.

353
00:19:33,468 --> 00:19:36,630
The structure of galaxies and the structure of star systems

354
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,011
has these properties.

355
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:40,813
Everything, everything, everything has these properties.

356
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:42,614
And not to get too weird about it,

357
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:44,615
but he kind of starts to come to this conclusion

358
00:19:44,615 --> 00:19:47,197
that these properties are more fundamental

359
00:19:47,197 --> 00:19:51,680
than the universe itself, because no universe can exist

360
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,301
that doesn't have these properties.

361
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:55,580
So this is a deep idea.

362
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:59,042
But we're not going to dwell on that deep idea.

363
00:19:59,042 --> 00:20:00,944
What we're going to do today is we're

364
00:20:00,944 --> 00:20:04,005
going to go through the 15 properties,

365
00:20:04,005 --> 00:20:05,807
and we're going to look at the question of,

366
00:20:05,807 --> 00:20:07,788
how can these properties help us when we're trying

367
00:20:07,788 --> 00:20:08,869
to construct game narratives?

368
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:12,871
All right, so the first one is this idea of levels of scale.

369
00:20:12,871 --> 00:20:16,754
And what he's talking about is that great things are not just

370
00:20:16,754 --> 00:20:18,595
great at a single level, they're usually

371
00:20:18,595 --> 00:20:20,256
great at multiple levels.

372
00:20:20,256 --> 00:20:22,177
They have multiple things interacting.

373
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:26,542
like this interesting kind of architectural porch here that has beautiful big elements,

374
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:31,067
beautiful medium-sized elements, and beautiful tiny elements.

375
00:20:31,067 --> 00:20:34,371
And of course, levels of scale, like that goes all through nature, right?

376
00:20:34,371 --> 00:20:35,231
Look at lightning bolts.

377
00:20:35,231 --> 00:20:36,293
They're incredibly fractal.

378
00:20:36,293 --> 00:20:40,317
They have the same structure up the top, and then they have tiny ones, and tiny, and tiny,

379
00:20:40,317 --> 00:20:41,098
and tiny.

380
00:20:41,098 --> 00:20:43,060
And that's how so many things in nature work.

381
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,142
Nature works at levels of scale.

382
00:20:46,206 --> 00:20:47,587
And in terms of creating beautiful things,

383
00:20:47,587 --> 00:20:49,788
I often think about what John Hench said.

384
00:20:49,788 --> 00:20:53,371
He was one of the old Imagineers and old Disney animators.

385
00:20:53,371 --> 00:20:55,772
And he would talk about how anyone

386
00:20:55,772 --> 00:20:59,294
can make something that's beautiful from far away.

387
00:20:59,294 --> 00:21:00,155
That's easy to do.

388
00:21:00,155 --> 00:21:01,696
You can make a big castle or something

389
00:21:01,696 --> 00:21:03,257
that looks beautiful from far away,

390
00:21:03,257 --> 00:21:04,858
but so often you get close and you're like,

391
00:21:04,858 --> 00:21:06,899
oh, is that what it is?

392
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:07,880
And that's part of the reason

393
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,181
if you go to Cinderella Castle at Disney World

394
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:12,043
and you go as close as you can,

395
00:21:12,043 --> 00:21:14,304
you will find there are these beautiful mosaics.

396
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:19,135
that are inlaid over many of the interior surfaces, and no matter how close you get,

397
00:21:19,135 --> 00:21:21,537
you see how gorgeous and beautiful they are.

398
00:21:21,537 --> 00:21:26,480
And in fact, if you look, even at the top, the little points of the towers are actually

399
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,926
made out of solid gold, because they really were committed to this notion of making things

400
00:21:32,926 --> 00:21:34,747
beautiful close up and far away.

401
00:21:35,484 --> 00:21:39,107
Now in games we use levels of scale all the time, because it feels good.

402
00:21:39,107 --> 00:21:42,490
It feels good to kind of move from big and into small.

403
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:47,975
And sometimes we use it in ways that are very, very powerful, this idea of kind of comparing

404
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:49,076
levels of scale.

405
00:21:49,076 --> 00:21:55,042
The game Spore was a symphony of levels of scale, and it was one of the things that was

406
00:21:55,042 --> 00:21:55,442
so exciting.

407
00:21:55,828 --> 00:21:57,149
and so appealing about it.

408
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,912
But you don't need to get into these giant,

409
00:21:59,912 --> 00:22:03,155
universe-sized levels of scale to do interesting things.

410
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,918
Part of the reason Pac-Man works so well

411
00:22:05,918 --> 00:22:07,980
is because it has good levels of scale.

412
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,063
Your immediate goal is get the dots,

413
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,184
and the dots are little.

414
00:22:12,184 --> 00:22:14,506
And then you have this other goal sometimes to get ghosts,

415
00:22:14,506 --> 00:22:15,687
and ghosts are kind of a big deal,

416
00:22:15,687 --> 00:22:17,849
and eating a ghost is kind of a big thing.

417
00:22:17,849 --> 00:22:19,371
And then your bigger goal is.

418
00:22:19,882 --> 00:22:21,844
clear a board, and that's like a big part of it.

419
00:22:21,844 --> 00:22:25,367
If the game didn't have all three of these levels of scale,

420
00:22:25,367 --> 00:22:27,289
it would feel sort of dull.

421
00:22:27,289 --> 00:22:28,970
If you were just doing one of those things,

422
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:29,891
it would feel sort of dull.

423
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:32,633
But the fact that you have these goals at three levels

424
00:22:32,633 --> 00:22:33,974
makes it much more interesting.

425
00:22:33,974 --> 00:22:36,376
And when it comes to story, of course,

426
00:22:36,376 --> 00:22:37,497
we have some of the same thing.

427
00:22:37,497 --> 00:22:41,201
You have plot, and plot is like a big structure.

428
00:22:41,201 --> 00:22:44,623
And that's your big structure for any story you put together.

429
00:22:44,623 --> 00:22:46,725
And then medium, you have characters.

430
00:22:47,085 --> 00:22:50,988
Right? Characters are kind of at the medium level of narrative design.

431
00:22:50,988 --> 00:22:55,951
And then at the small level of narrative design, you have your fabulous dialogue.

432
00:22:55,951 --> 00:22:56,311
Right?

433
00:22:56,311 --> 00:22:56,372
Um...

434
00:22:56,372 --> 00:23:04,878
And if all three of these things are not excellent, if like John Hench was talking about,

435
00:23:04,878 --> 00:23:10,081
you have a beautiful plot, but boring characters and dull dialogue, everything stinks.

436
00:23:10,081 --> 00:23:15,305
Right? But if you're great at all three of these levels, you have something that's really solid and really wonderful.

437
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:19,577
So the second pattern is the idea of strong centers.

438
00:23:19,577 --> 00:23:21,939
Now that seems a little self-referential, because if

439
00:23:21,939 --> 00:23:24,681
the whole idea is we're defining what centers are,

440
00:23:24,681 --> 00:23:26,822
then how is strong centers a pattern?

441
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,924
And what he's just talking about is that the stronger the

442
00:23:29,924 --> 00:23:32,106
centers are, the better things get.

443
00:23:32,106 --> 00:23:34,668
And I like this example of a plaza here.

444
00:23:34,668 --> 00:23:37,970
Imagine the plaza without that upmost tower, like the top

445
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:38,671
tower there.

446
00:23:38,671 --> 00:23:40,832
It would not be as strong.

447
00:23:40,832 --> 00:23:43,935
It would not be as interesting.

448
00:23:44,495 --> 00:23:46,796
There are different things that multiply.

449
00:23:46,796 --> 00:23:50,818
Multiple patterns come together and make centers much

450
00:23:50,818 --> 00:23:52,959
stronger than they would be on their own.

451
00:23:52,959 --> 00:23:56,021
And of course, we see this all through nature.

452
00:23:56,021 --> 00:23:59,543
We see it on star systems are all about strong centers.

453
00:23:59,543 --> 00:24:02,044
You've got these suns at the center.

454
00:24:02,044 --> 00:24:06,066
If you look down at the microscopic level at the way

455
00:24:06,066 --> 00:24:09,368
atoms are formed and the way molecules come together,

456
00:24:09,368 --> 00:24:12,630
you'll see again these really strong centers, the nucleus.

457
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:19,552
of each atom. We see it in video games all the time. Yeah, Star Castle. Those are some

458
00:24:19,552 --> 00:24:24,415
strong centers right there. That dude does not want you knocking on his door, man. He

459
00:24:24,415 --> 00:24:29,817
doesn't, but if you're good, you can kind of get in there. Get in there. Get, no, come

460
00:24:29,817 --> 00:24:37,381
on, get in there. Yes, right? Strong centers, that's part of what makes PUBG work, right?

461
00:24:37,381 --> 00:24:41,563
If PUBG was just an island and you ran around, like, who would care? But what happens is

462
00:24:41,784 --> 00:24:44,406
There is a secret center and you don't know where it is,

463
00:24:44,406 --> 00:24:47,189
and the whole world is shrinking down to the secret center.

464
00:24:47,189 --> 00:24:49,531
And if you're near the center, you're going to die.

465
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:50,652
It's going to kill you.

466
00:24:50,652 --> 00:24:51,633
And where is the center?

467
00:24:51,633 --> 00:24:53,114
Where is the center?

468
00:24:53,114 --> 00:24:54,995
And that's what everybody wants to know.

469
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:58,498
And people get very emotional about that.

470
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:01,421
They end up having very strong feelings about the centers

471
00:25:01,421 --> 00:25:03,022
in PUBG, but we won't dwell on that.

472
00:25:03,022 --> 00:25:08,387
One thing I often think about is choose your own adventure

473
00:25:08,387 --> 00:25:09,428
type stories.

474
00:25:10,131 --> 00:25:15,333
and how as a genre of writing, it never really sticks that well.

475
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:17,954
In the literary world, every few years, someone will say,

476
00:25:17,954 --> 00:25:20,095
hey, here's some new choose-your-own-adventures,

477
00:25:20,095 --> 00:25:22,536
and they'll kind of be a thing for kids.

478
00:25:22,536 --> 00:25:24,357
But if you, like, go to Barnes & Noble,

479
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:27,118
there's not, like, a choose-your-own-adventures section,

480
00:25:27,118 --> 00:25:28,659
because it's just not a genre that stays.

481
00:25:28,659 --> 00:25:32,280
And I think part of the problem is, where are the strong centers?

482
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,781
They're just not here.

483
00:25:33,781 --> 00:25:37,703
Choose-your-own-adventure structure is a big, gangly, floppy thing.

484
00:25:38,097 --> 00:25:40,819
with no real strong center.

485
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:42,740
And that makes it hard to enjoy.

486
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,761
So I found again and again the idea

487
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:48,563
of finding out what are the centers of my game?

488
00:25:48,563 --> 00:25:50,404
Because now you have to ask the question,

489
00:25:50,404 --> 00:25:51,885
if strong centers are important,

490
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:53,306
what are the centers of my game?

491
00:25:53,306 --> 00:25:57,008
So we're working on a game at Shell Games right now,

492
00:25:57,008 --> 00:25:59,389
all about a virtual chemistry lab.

493
00:25:59,389 --> 00:26:01,450
And originally it was called SuperChem,

494
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:02,731
and we started trying to figure out,

495
00:26:02,731 --> 00:26:04,152
all right, what are the centers of this?

496
00:26:04,152 --> 00:26:05,532
We knew that our central mechanic

497
00:26:05,532 --> 00:26:07,113
was realistic manipulation.

498
00:26:07,863 --> 00:26:09,644
of laboratory equipment.

499
00:26:09,644 --> 00:26:11,265
We knew that that was central.

500
00:26:11,265 --> 00:26:12,805
If we didn't get that right, we were in trouble.

501
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:14,646
This is meant to be an educational game,

502
00:26:14,646 --> 00:26:16,026
so it has a transformational goal

503
00:26:16,026 --> 00:26:17,667
of teaching real lab skills.

504
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:19,987
So if we don't get that right, that's a problem.

505
00:26:19,987 --> 00:26:22,208
So these two things we know are centers.

506
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:24,489
But then this could be boring, right?

507
00:26:24,489 --> 00:26:26,710
This could end up being like a really boring thing

508
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,550
if we don't do it right.

509
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:29,531
So we knew a central aspect was

510
00:26:29,531 --> 00:26:31,231
that we needed a strong fantasy.

511
00:26:31,231 --> 00:26:33,352
And we knew that a lot of people have a fantasy

512
00:26:33,352 --> 00:26:36,253
of I'm the lab genius, I'm the mad scientist in the lab.

513
00:26:36,723 --> 00:26:40,484
So we changed it from Superchem to now it's called the HoloLab Champions, right?

514
00:26:40,484 --> 00:26:45,045
And it's all about being the greatest lab worker in the world.

515
00:26:45,045 --> 00:26:49,307
And we found that these three things together by focusing on these as the center,

516
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:51,527
things are starting to come together with that game.

517
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:57,029
So another pattern, pattern number three, property number three is boundaries.

518
00:26:58,501 --> 00:27:02,924
Boundaries, as Alexander puts it, they draw attention to the center.

519
00:27:02,924 --> 00:27:04,965
Boundaries create centers.

520
00:27:04,965 --> 00:27:07,947
And right here you see a map of a cathedral here.

521
00:27:07,947 --> 00:27:10,349
And you see how important the boundaries are

522
00:27:10,349 --> 00:27:11,589
in terms of creating centers.

523
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:14,331
Here's some boundaries in nature.

524
00:27:14,331 --> 00:27:17,994
Here's a cutaway of some wood cells.

525
00:27:17,994 --> 00:27:19,655
Nature is all about the boundaries.

526
00:27:19,655 --> 00:27:21,396
All living things are made out of cells,

527
00:27:21,396 --> 00:27:23,037
and cells have boundaries all over the place.

528
00:27:23,037 --> 00:27:24,838
Check out this door.

529
00:27:24,838 --> 00:27:26,039
It's kind of a cool door.

530
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:27,340
Looks pretty cool.

531
00:27:27,747 --> 00:27:28,907
I'd be like, I might go in that door.

532
00:27:28,907 --> 00:27:29,388
How about now?

533
00:27:29,388 --> 00:27:29,868
Yeah, right?

534
00:27:29,868 --> 00:27:31,409
Look at all those boundaries.

535
00:27:31,409 --> 00:27:34,551
Boundaries make things important.

536
00:27:34,551 --> 00:27:37,033
Boundary, boundary, boundary, boundary.

537
00:27:37,033 --> 00:27:38,935
You'll find the fancier any picture is,

538
00:27:38,935 --> 00:27:42,317
the more boundaries it has on the frame going around it.

539
00:27:42,317 --> 00:27:44,078
Because there's something about boundaries

540
00:27:44,078 --> 00:27:46,180
that creates strong centers, makes things important.

541
00:27:46,751 --> 00:27:49,133
Now in game design, we know all about boundaries.

542
00:27:49,133 --> 00:27:51,695
So many games are all about boundaries and boundary lines

543
00:27:51,695 --> 00:27:53,316
and cross this line and cross that line

544
00:27:53,316 --> 00:27:55,978
and complete this goal and complete that goal.

545
00:27:55,978 --> 00:27:57,820
We're all about boundaries in game design.

546
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,802
But what about in our narrative design?

547
00:28:00,802 --> 00:28:02,663
Are there boundaries there?

548
00:28:02,663 --> 00:28:04,865
Well, they show up in surprising places

549
00:28:04,865 --> 00:28:06,586
if you talk about the hero's journey.

550
00:28:06,586 --> 00:28:08,788
The obvious place they show up there is with thresholds.

551
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:12,191
Those moments where you cross and you can't come back.

552
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,171
That's really important.

553
00:28:13,171 --> 00:28:15,013
If you don't have good thresholds in your story design,

554
00:28:15,423 --> 00:28:16,764
then you don't have good story.

555
00:28:16,764 --> 00:28:18,785
You've got to have those clear boundaries.

556
00:28:18,785 --> 00:28:22,288
And the most interesting stories are usually

557
00:28:22,288 --> 00:28:25,210
the ones that pit two systems against each other

558
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:26,671
with conflicting boundaries.

559
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:29,673
And you have to make a choice about which boundaries you're

560
00:28:29,673 --> 00:28:31,014
going to respect and which boundaries

561
00:28:31,014 --> 00:28:33,856
are going to violate, because that ends up being exciting.

562
00:28:33,856 --> 00:28:35,737
This was part of the idea in Bioshock

563
00:28:35,737 --> 00:28:37,058
with the Little Sisters.

564
00:28:37,657 --> 00:28:41,219
Right? You've got one system that says you want to get as many points as possible.

565
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:45,482
Well, guess what? In order to get as many points as possible, you're going to need to murder a bunch of little girls.

566
00:28:45,482 --> 00:28:49,885
Or, you can rescue the little girls, but you only get half as many points.

567
00:28:49,885 --> 00:28:57,130
So now your normal sense of decency and its boundaries are put up against the boundaries of winning at the game.

568
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:01,973
Similarly, Papers, Please is a game that establishes all these rules.

569
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:04,234
Here's your job. This is what you do.

570
00:29:04,234 --> 00:29:06,396
You need to obey the rules in a certain way.

571
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:10,282
And then it puts you in situations where, again,

572
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:13,925
your sense of human decency is like maybe violating the rules

573
00:29:13,925 --> 00:29:15,826
is the right thing in this case.

574
00:29:15,826 --> 00:29:18,428
So the system of rules and the system of what's right

575
00:29:18,428 --> 00:29:19,369
come into conflict.

576
00:29:19,369 --> 00:29:22,291
So I often find that creating the best, most interesting

577
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:27,215
stories is about boundaries in conflict with each other.

578
00:29:27,215 --> 00:29:30,097
So now a surprising pattern, alternating repetition.

579
00:29:30,097 --> 00:29:34,040
And you can see it illustrated here in the classical egg dark

580
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,441
pattern, which you can see in buildings.

581
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,551
all over the place, outside.

582
00:29:37,551 --> 00:29:40,853
This is a pattern that's been around thousands of years,

583
00:29:40,853 --> 00:29:43,154
will not go away, because we like

584
00:29:43,154 --> 00:29:45,015
alternating repetitions so much.

585
00:29:45,015 --> 00:29:47,156
But wait, isn't repetition boring?

586
00:29:47,156 --> 00:29:49,057
Well, repetition can be boring.

587
00:29:49,057 --> 00:29:51,219
When it's just straight repetition,

588
00:29:51,219 --> 00:29:53,680
it's boring and bad, it has a bad feeling.

589
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,742
But when it's alternating repetition, we love it.

590
00:29:56,742 --> 00:29:59,063
So consider the checkerboard.

591
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:01,164
We don't have to make checkerboards like this.

592
00:30:01,164 --> 00:30:03,186
We could have made it a piece of graph paper.

593
00:30:03,186 --> 00:30:04,727
But we don't like a piece of graph paper.

594
00:30:05,494 --> 00:30:07,235
we like alternating repetition.

595
00:30:07,235 --> 00:30:09,376
We could have made it a rainbow of squares,

596
00:30:09,376 --> 00:30:11,296
a bunch of different colors, all different colors.

597
00:30:11,296 --> 00:30:12,297
No, no, no, no, no.

598
00:30:12,297 --> 00:30:15,818
Alternating repetition is what we like as humans.

599
00:30:15,818 --> 00:30:18,119
And we see this everywhere.

600
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:18,999
Everybody knows, you know,

601
00:30:18,999 --> 00:30:21,420
anyone here is gonna know about the flow channel,

602
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,061
keeping your game kind of on that wonderful place

603
00:30:24,061 --> 00:30:25,782
between boredom and anxiety,

604
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,302
in that wonderful state of flow,

605
00:30:27,302 --> 00:30:29,463
and you increase your flow over time.

606
00:30:29,463 --> 00:30:30,544
But of course, we all know

607
00:30:30,544 --> 00:30:32,504
that's not really the right way to do it.

608
00:30:32,504 --> 00:30:34,905
That's the right way to do it, right?

609
00:30:35,214 --> 00:30:38,076
You get a little bored because it's a little too easy.

610
00:30:38,076 --> 00:30:39,517
And oh my god, it got so hard.

611
00:30:39,517 --> 00:30:41,318
And now, I get a little bit of a break.

612
00:30:41,318 --> 00:30:43,100
You get a tension and then a release.

613
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,541
A tension and then a release.

614
00:30:45,541 --> 00:30:47,443
That's a pattern that we like.

615
00:30:47,443 --> 00:30:49,684
And of course, you see this in games like Flame in the Flood.

616
00:30:49,684 --> 00:30:52,306
You have these horrible, intense experiences on the islands.

617
00:30:52,306 --> 00:30:54,067
And now, I'm back on the river.

618
00:30:54,067 --> 00:30:55,168
And it's OK.

619
00:30:55,168 --> 00:30:55,849
And I can relax.

620
00:30:55,849 --> 00:30:57,229
And all right, I'm getting ready.

621
00:30:57,229 --> 00:30:57,970
I'm relaxed enough.

622
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:59,391
It's actually getting a little boring here on the river.

623
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:00,472
I'm going to go back on the island.

624
00:31:00,472 --> 00:31:01,953
And it's going to get exciting again.

625
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,202
And even in one of the most classic patterns of game

626
00:31:05,202 --> 00:31:07,763
narrative, the string of pearls or the rivers and lakes

627
00:31:07,763 --> 00:31:09,524
approach, where you have a cut scene and a level,

628
00:31:09,524 --> 00:31:10,425
and a cut scene and a level.

629
00:31:10,425 --> 00:31:14,447
And as much as people sometimes deride that pattern,

630
00:31:14,447 --> 00:31:16,308
the reason the pattern doesn't go away

631
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:19,110
is because it's wonderful alternating repetition.

632
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,431
We like to kind of take a break and sort of see

633
00:31:21,431 --> 00:31:23,833
what's going on, and get set up for the next thing,

634
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:26,214
and then get all active, and then take a break.

635
00:31:26,214 --> 00:31:29,476
So it's alternating repetition that feels really good.

636
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:36,216
The fifth pattern took me a while to understand, the pattern he calls positive space.

637
00:31:36,216 --> 00:31:40,699
And what's weird about it is what he's saying is that things that are well designed don't

638
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:46,523
just have a good shape unto themselves, like here's this ancient bowl that has kind of

639
00:31:46,523 --> 00:31:52,887
a cool shape, but also the negative space around them also has a good shape.

640
00:31:52,887 --> 00:31:58,931
So if you look at the shape around the bowl, it actually is kind of a cool, pleasing shape.

641
00:31:58,931 --> 00:31:59,852
As a counterexample...

642
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:01,993
Here's a sculpture that's just kind of, you know,

643
00:32:01,993 --> 00:32:03,954
modern sculpture right there.

644
00:32:03,954 --> 00:32:06,374
And it's kind of a cool shape by itself.

645
00:32:06,374 --> 00:32:09,855
But the space around it doesn't really have much of a shape.

646
00:32:09,855 --> 00:32:12,275
And as a result, the thing is just kind of a little bit

647
00:32:12,275 --> 00:32:12,515
blah.

648
00:32:12,515 --> 00:32:16,296
So we see this spatially in games all the time, right?

649
00:32:16,296 --> 00:32:18,797
There's a Monument Valley level right there.

650
00:32:18,797 --> 00:32:20,977
And you see it's got a cool shape all by itself.

651
00:32:20,977 --> 00:32:23,538
But also look at the negative space around it.

652
00:32:23,538 --> 00:32:26,378
Those are good, interesting shapes.

653
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,182
But what does this mean in the world of narrative?

654
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:33,704
What does positive and negative space mean in narrative?

655
00:32:33,704 --> 00:32:38,847
And I think, I sometimes think the right way

656
00:32:38,847 --> 00:32:42,750
to think about it is positive space can be dialogue,

657
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,111
is a kind of positive space.

658
00:32:44,111 --> 00:32:46,332
So what is that negative space then?

659
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:49,574
Well, it's either silence or someone else's dialogue.

660
00:32:49,574 --> 00:32:53,937
And this is illustrated incredibly well in Oxenfree.

661
00:32:53,937 --> 00:32:56,179
If people have played this, this is

662
00:32:56,179 --> 00:32:56,719
so masterfully.

663
00:32:57,253 --> 00:33:01,797
created. Because like a lot of games, you make these little choices. Here are your different

664
00:33:01,797 --> 00:33:06,762
text choices. Lots of games have this. But what's so artfully done in Oxenfree is you

665
00:33:06,762 --> 00:33:11,807
don't have to pick one of the choices. Silence is an option. And then something else will

666
00:33:11,807 --> 00:33:12,228
happen.

667
00:33:12,807 --> 00:33:14,808
And so if you want to, you can be silent.

668
00:33:14,808 --> 00:33:17,429
And then more than just silence being an option, when

669
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:18,650
you pick these is up to you.

670
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:21,471
It's not like someone talks and then they wait, like

671
00:33:21,471 --> 00:33:22,431
normal games.

672
00:33:22,431 --> 00:33:25,453
In Oxenfree, the dialogue options come up while someone

673
00:33:25,453 --> 00:33:27,874
else is talking, and you can interrupt them at any time.

674
00:33:27,874 --> 00:33:30,455
And sometimes interrupting them is fine and the right

675
00:33:30,455 --> 00:33:31,196
thing to do.

676
00:33:31,196 --> 00:33:32,777
Sometimes it's incredibly insulting.

677
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:36,518
And other times, saying anything at all is a bad idea

678
00:33:36,518 --> 00:33:38,920
because someone is saying something very important.

679
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,260
And you want to say something.

680
00:33:40,655 --> 00:33:46,297
but actually restraining yourself and letting the other person talk is the better choice.

681
00:33:46,297 --> 00:33:50,799
So it's more natural, it's more like things are in the real world, and again, it has this

682
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,840
idea of positive and negative space in dialogue.

683
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,182
Another pattern is the idea of good shape.

684
00:33:58,182 --> 00:34:04,505
He makes a simple observation that things that are well-constructed and meet their own

685
00:34:04,505 --> 00:34:10,267
purposes and do so well and help everyone out, they tend to take on shapes.

686
00:34:10,735 --> 00:34:12,896
that are just beautiful by themselves.

687
00:34:12,896 --> 00:34:17,377
And so in some ways, good shape is kind of a signifier

688
00:34:17,377 --> 00:34:20,598
that yeah, you probably did this right.

689
00:34:20,598 --> 00:34:24,198
Like look at this boat sail, right?

690
00:34:24,198 --> 00:34:27,659
Man, that just looks so strong and so powerful.

691
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:30,260
And of course it wasn't designed to be beautiful,

692
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:34,661
it was designed to maximize its ability to move the boat.

693
00:34:34,661 --> 00:34:37,741
Now we have good shapes in games all the time, right?

694
00:34:37,741 --> 00:34:38,642
There's a little.

695
00:34:38,873 --> 00:34:41,736
It's a little bit of Legend of Zelda shape right there.

696
00:34:41,736 --> 00:34:44,058
Here's one I like, a classic, Phoenix.

697
00:34:44,058 --> 00:34:46,981
That's kind of a cool shape on that big boss monster.

698
00:34:46,981 --> 00:34:48,983
This, I believe, is the first boss monster

699
00:34:48,983 --> 00:34:51,706
in the history of gaming, is that guy in Phoenix.

700
00:34:51,706 --> 00:34:55,029
But sort of what's so cool about this as a shape,

701
00:34:55,029 --> 00:34:57,832
it's not just designed to be pretty, it's functional.

702
00:34:58,228 --> 00:35:02,129
The whole idea is you're going to shoot holes in all that orange mass underneath

703
00:35:02,129 --> 00:35:04,389
because you've got to shoot that purple guy in the middle.

704
00:35:04,389 --> 00:35:07,370
And of course, he's really hard to shoot because you've got to clear this big tunnel

705
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,711
because there's so much stuff around him.

706
00:35:09,711 --> 00:35:13,992
But the secret strategy is that purple ribbon under him is a rotating ribbon

707
00:35:13,992 --> 00:35:15,472
and you need to shoot holes in that.

708
00:35:15,472 --> 00:35:18,313
But what you can do is move over to the side,

709
00:35:18,313 --> 00:35:20,454
shoot along the side and get holes in the ribbon

710
00:35:20,454 --> 00:35:23,114
and get the ribbon all busted up and then go back to the middle

711
00:35:23,114 --> 00:35:24,375
because the middle is dangerous

712
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:26,555
because that dude is dropping all these things on you.

713
00:35:27,198 --> 00:35:29,800
So, because everything's functional in the game,

714
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,622
like, there's just this good shape naturally emerges from it.

715
00:35:32,622 --> 00:35:35,183
And shapes can be spatial, but when, again,

716
00:35:35,183 --> 00:35:38,186
when you get into the world of narrative,

717
00:35:38,186 --> 00:35:40,547
like, what is, what are shapes,

718
00:35:40,547 --> 00:35:43,109
what do we mean by good shape?

719
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:46,671
I think sometimes we need to think of good shape

720
00:35:46,671 --> 00:35:48,112
in terms of time.

721
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:52,155
Having the right shape of interaction over time is important.

722
00:35:52,852 --> 00:35:57,115
One of the things I was blown away when I first played

723
00:35:57,115 --> 00:36:00,838
the interactive Walking Dead by a few different things.

724
00:36:00,838 --> 00:36:04,761
So traditionally when we've had interactive dialogue moments

725
00:36:04,761 --> 00:36:06,182
we put them at important times.

726
00:36:06,182 --> 00:36:09,665
Now of course that means you're respecting

727
00:36:09,665 --> 00:36:11,826
the story first of all.

728
00:36:11,826 --> 00:36:12,947
Walking Dead didn't do that.

729
00:36:12,947 --> 00:36:15,889
Walking Dead said no the most important thing is

730
00:36:15,889 --> 00:36:19,032
rhythm of interaction is most important.

731
00:36:19,032 --> 00:36:21,393
There's a shape of interaction that we like.

732
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:25,751
And we're going to give you dialogue interactions at that rhythm, so it feels good, so it feels

733
00:36:25,751 --> 00:36:26,051
natural.

734
00:36:26,051 --> 00:36:31,033
But you're like, ah, but what if some of those, what if those dialogue things don't mean anything?

735
00:36:31,033 --> 00:36:31,813
That's okay.

736
00:36:31,813 --> 00:36:34,754
A lot of things we say don't mean anything.

737
00:36:34,754 --> 00:36:35,695
And that's okay.

738
00:36:35,695 --> 00:36:38,376
Now, the problem is that creates a bad ambiguity.

739
00:36:38,376 --> 00:36:41,837
How do I know if something I said was helpful or not helpful?

740
00:36:41,837 --> 00:36:46,259
And these guys had the insight to when you do something that really makes a difference,

741
00:36:46,259 --> 00:36:49,660
this little thing pops up, that so and so will remember that.

742
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:49,840
Right?

743
00:36:51,456 --> 00:36:55,480
And personally, I feel like that was a really good shape that

744
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,002
kind of came out of thoughtful design.

745
00:36:58,002 --> 00:37:01,745
So here's a surprising pattern, local symmetries.

746
00:37:01,745 --> 00:37:04,908
This is not an obvious idea at first.

747
00:37:04,908 --> 00:37:08,431
We all are always told that symmetrical things are

748
00:37:08,431 --> 00:37:11,553
beautiful and beauty is symmetry, et cetera, et cetera.

749
00:37:11,553 --> 00:37:13,135
But look at this building.

750
00:37:13,135 --> 00:37:15,017
That's not a very symmetrical building.

751
00:37:15,017 --> 00:37:18,580
But then you notice, this is the Alhambra here.

752
00:37:19,002 --> 00:37:25,967
It is full of small symmetries, little symmetrical rectangular spaces, symmetrical rotational

753
00:37:25,967 --> 00:37:26,888
spaces.

754
00:37:26,888 --> 00:37:30,351
It's a bunch of local symmetries all glued together.

755
00:37:30,351 --> 00:37:35,975
And this was, I'd never heard anyone make this observation before, that many great,

756
00:37:35,975 --> 00:37:40,018
wonderful, persistent things are local symmetries all glued together.

757
00:37:40,018 --> 00:37:43,000
The human body is certainly this way.

758
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,723
Our hands are a local symmetry with each other, but they're not symmetrical with our feet.

759
00:37:47,215 --> 00:37:49,537
And it wouldn't be better if they were, right?

760
00:37:49,537 --> 00:37:52,339
That wouldn't necessarily be a good thing.

761
00:37:52,339 --> 00:37:54,680
And certainly, look at our organs inside the body.

762
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,881
Some of them are symmetrical with each other.

763
00:37:56,881 --> 00:37:57,542
Others are not.

764
00:37:57,542 --> 00:38:00,844
And then they're all kind of glued together, these very

765
00:38:00,844 --> 00:38:03,786
different things, with each one having its own symmetry,

766
00:38:03,786 --> 00:38:05,887
all kind of stuck together.

767
00:38:05,887 --> 00:38:07,608
Where do we see this in games?

768
00:38:07,608 --> 00:38:10,210
Well, here's a map of the original Zelda.

769
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:11,700
I mean, look at that.

770
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,201
It's like the map of the Alhambra.

771
00:38:13,201 --> 00:38:16,082
There's no overall symmetry, because overall symmetry

772
00:38:16,082 --> 00:38:17,182
isn't helpful.

773
00:38:17,182 --> 00:38:20,444
But look at all the local symmetries.

774
00:38:20,444 --> 00:38:23,565
Look at all the little local symmetries all glued together.

775
00:38:23,565 --> 00:38:26,807
Now, when it comes to stories, I am less clear

776
00:38:26,807 --> 00:38:28,808
at what relevance this has.

777
00:38:28,808 --> 00:38:31,449
I'm a little stumped by this, honestly.

778
00:38:31,449 --> 00:38:35,831
I have an instinct that it has something to do with characters.

779
00:38:35,831 --> 00:38:37,412
When I see a bunch of characters that

780
00:38:37,412 --> 00:38:38,492
are all different from each other,

781
00:38:39,223 --> 00:38:40,823
and they're all kind of brought together.

782
00:38:40,823 --> 00:38:43,404
Like this feels like local symmetries to me,

783
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,284
but I feel like there's something deeper

784
00:38:45,284 --> 00:38:47,144
with local symmetries in narrative

785
00:38:47,144 --> 00:38:48,765
that I don't understand yet.

786
00:38:48,765 --> 00:38:51,105
But let's press on.

787
00:38:51,105 --> 00:38:53,286
Pattern eight, deep interlock.

788
00:38:53,286 --> 00:38:55,666
And actually, as the way Alexander puts it,

789
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,727
ambiguity and deep interlock.

790
00:38:57,727 --> 00:38:59,747
And normally we think of ambiguity as bad,

791
00:38:59,747 --> 00:39:03,068
but what he's talking about is an ambiguity

792
00:39:03,068 --> 00:39:05,168
where you have two things interacting with each other

793
00:39:05,168 --> 00:39:06,788
in such a powerful way.

794
00:39:07,287 --> 00:39:10,849
that it's hard to give attribution to either one of them.

795
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,650
So here's some Inca stone carving

796
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:15,392
where these stones just fit together perfectly

797
00:39:15,392 --> 00:39:16,453
and beautifully.

798
00:39:16,453 --> 00:39:19,735
And which one defines the space over the other?

799
00:39:19,735 --> 00:39:23,057
I mean, this is the idea of the dovetail joint, right?

800
00:39:23,057 --> 00:39:24,397
Neither one is in charge.

801
00:39:24,397 --> 00:39:26,679
It's only because they are both perfectly,

802
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:30,461
deeply interlocked that you have something

803
00:39:30,461 --> 00:39:32,162
that's strong and solid.

804
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:34,157
We see this in games.

805
00:39:34,157 --> 00:39:37,959
Certainly, the game of Go is all about deep interlock.

806
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,920
There's nothing to push against in the game

807
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,181
except the other player.

808
00:39:41,181 --> 00:39:42,722
And everything that one player does

809
00:39:42,722 --> 00:39:45,703
is defined by pushing against the other player.

810
00:39:45,703 --> 00:39:49,386
And each game ends up being its own kind of organism and entity

811
00:39:49,386 --> 00:39:53,768
the way things are pushed together.

812
00:39:53,768 --> 00:39:59,091
Terence Lee talks about the idea of two kinds of stories

813
00:39:59,091 --> 00:39:59,692
in every game.

814
00:40:00,241 --> 00:40:04,804
that there is the explicit story, which is the one the designer is trying to tell.

815
00:40:04,804 --> 00:40:07,525
But then there is the player's story.

816
00:40:07,525 --> 00:40:12,768
The story of what the player is experiencing, the story that's happening to them.

817
00:40:12,768 --> 00:40:18,072
And when those line up, it feels great, and when those don't line up, it's super bad.

818
00:40:18,478 --> 00:40:23,622
Like maybe you've got a situation where you as the designer, you gave a sidekick to the character,

819
00:40:23,622 --> 00:40:26,764
and you're like, yeah, I've got this awesome sidekick, and I think it's great, and I think it's funny,

820
00:40:26,764 --> 00:40:30,066
and the player's like, I hate this guy. I totally hate this sidekick.

821
00:40:30,066 --> 00:40:34,669
And then you create a situation where, oh no, the sidekick fell in a well!

822
00:40:34,669 --> 00:40:36,490
You've got to help out the sidekick!

823
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:39,652
And the player might be like, no, screw that, right?

824
00:40:39,652 --> 00:40:44,996
I'm so glad that guy fell in a well. Do I really have to rescue that guy? I really don't want to.

825
00:40:44,996 --> 00:40:47,397
That's terrible. That means everything's falling apart.

826
00:40:47,757 --> 00:40:52,698
in your story because you don't have good deep interlock between the player's story

827
00:40:52,698 --> 00:40:53,858
and the explicit story.

828
00:40:53,858 --> 00:40:59,540
And this is one of the first games I experienced that did this really well was Planetfall,

829
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,360
you know, the old Steve Moretzky game here.

830
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:08,602
He creates this beautiful sidekick, this character named Floyd, who's funny and cute and you

831
00:41:08,602 --> 00:41:12,463
just can't help but be super entertained by Floyd.

832
00:41:12,463 --> 00:41:14,903
And so as a result, when

833
00:41:15,277 --> 00:41:20,979
horrible things happen to Floyd, you're like, no, you're like, it's a big deal.

834
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:28,121
And I've talked to many people where this was the first time they cried during a game

835
00:41:28,121 --> 00:41:30,702
was in Planetfall because these things were just so well aligned.

836
00:41:30,702 --> 00:41:33,724
Yes, so there's your deep interlock, see, between, yeah, okay, you got it.

837
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:38,705
All right, next pattern is contrast.

838
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:43,327
Okay, I love this, this bowl, and Alexander has a picture of the bowl in his book and he...

839
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,924
He points out how the two opposites really make this one unity.

840
00:41:47,924 --> 00:41:50,305
They really bring things together.

841
00:41:50,305 --> 00:41:53,268
And contrast, of course, does make things stronger,

842
00:41:53,268 --> 00:41:56,550
but often in surprising ways.

843
00:41:56,550 --> 00:42:00,033
Zippy the Pinhead, via Bill Griffith,

844
00:42:00,033 --> 00:42:03,436
once had a long expostulation about the nature of comedy,

845
00:42:03,436 --> 00:42:08,880
where he points out that all comedy is the unity of opposites.

846
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,001
I'll let you think about that for a minute.

847
00:42:11,001 --> 00:42:11,822
Right there.

848
00:42:12,466 --> 00:42:17,409
the unity of opposites. But it's true. All comedy is the unity of opposites. Like this

849
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:27,034
sign. Right? It's funny because these two things should not be together. Or I saw this

850
00:42:27,034 --> 00:42:39,381
sign in Newcastle. Right? And that's how comedy works. And comedy is really important in our

851
00:42:39,381 --> 00:42:40,382
stories, right?

852
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:45,203
understanding how to get that contrast, how to get the two opposites together and bring

853
00:42:45,203 --> 00:42:47,865
them together in a surprising way is important.

854
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:55,390
And this brings me to Undertale, which of course has a lot of really wonderful, funny

855
00:42:55,390 --> 00:43:01,614
moments in it, but at the same time, it has a lot of really serious moments in it.

856
00:43:01,614 --> 00:43:06,017
So it's a weird game because it's very silly and very serious.

857
00:43:06,017 --> 00:43:08,559
But now I ask you the question.

858
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:14,822
Would Undertale be more serious if you took the funny parts out?

859
00:43:14,822 --> 00:43:18,223
And would it be funnier if you took the serious parts out?

860
00:43:18,223 --> 00:43:20,463
The answer in both cases, I think, is no.

861
00:43:20,463 --> 00:43:24,064
The serious parts make the funny parts funny,

862
00:43:24,064 --> 00:43:28,545
and the funny parts make the serious parts more serious.

863
00:43:28,545 --> 00:43:30,486
That is the magic of contrast.

864
00:43:30,486 --> 00:43:34,467
It requires a certain bravery to use it,

865
00:43:34,467 --> 00:43:37,528
but when you do, it can be used to really, really great effect.

866
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:42,897
So the next one is gradients or graded variation.

867
00:43:42,897 --> 00:43:46,259
And this is just an observation that when things change

868
00:43:46,259 --> 00:43:48,780
gradually, that is sometimes beautiful.

869
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,820
We talked about boundaries when things change suddenly.

870
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:56,923
But also a gradual change can be a beautiful thing.

871
00:43:56,923 --> 00:43:59,564
And I had to rack my brain a bit to think about gradual

872
00:43:59,564 --> 00:44:02,705
changes in games, because we often have very punctuated

873
00:44:02,705 --> 00:44:03,285
changes.

874
00:44:03,662 --> 00:44:07,064
in games. Gradual changes are often more hidden and subtle.

875
00:44:07,064 --> 00:44:12,708
But one that I thought of, a recent game, Jason Rohrer's new game, One Hour,

876
00:44:12,708 --> 00:44:18,673
One Life. I don't know if people are familiar with this game, but

877
00:44:18,673 --> 00:44:21,134
the idea is that you log into this world

878
00:44:21,134 --> 00:44:23,556
and you are a baby. You come into the world as a baby.

879
00:44:23,556 --> 00:44:27,999
And you're going to live one hour. But in that one hour, you're going to go from

880
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:32,603
a baby to a very old person. And at the end of that hour, you're going to die.

881
00:44:33,802 --> 00:44:36,103
But it's a persistent world.

882
00:44:36,103 --> 00:44:39,365
And so the changes that you make will be permanent.

883
00:44:39,365 --> 00:44:42,827
And when you log in in the future as a new person,

884
00:44:42,827 --> 00:44:45,548
generations down the road, you will

885
00:44:45,548 --> 00:44:47,549
have a mother and father in the game,

886
00:44:47,549 --> 00:44:49,911
and the world will be persistent.

887
00:44:49,911 --> 00:44:52,132
And part of the power of the game

888
00:44:52,132 --> 00:44:56,054
is that gradual change over the course of an hour.

889
00:44:56,054 --> 00:44:59,817
So finding those gradual changes can be important.

890
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:05,522
Pattern 11 is very counterintuitive, the idea of roughness.

891
00:45:05,522 --> 00:45:08,785
Now normally we think of roughness as a bad thing.

892
00:45:08,785 --> 00:45:10,827
We want to smooth things out, we want to sand things,

893
00:45:10,827 --> 00:45:15,331
we want to polish things, we want to take away all roughness.

894
00:45:15,331 --> 00:45:19,034
But what he points out is that roughness often

895
00:45:19,034 --> 00:45:23,478
is part of what makes things great and real.

896
00:45:23,478 --> 00:45:26,460
I love his picture of this house, which in a lot of ways

897
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,602
seems kind of like an atrocity, right?

898
00:45:29,049 --> 00:45:32,310
The lines don't line up right, it's very inconsistent,

899
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:37,311
but there's a very human, peaceful quality about it.

900
00:45:37,311 --> 00:45:42,592
One example I think about a lot is pure vanilla extract.

901
00:45:42,592 --> 00:45:45,172
If you go to the grocery store, you have a choice.

902
00:45:45,172 --> 00:45:47,013
You can buy pure vanilla extract,

903
00:45:47,013 --> 00:45:52,574
or for a dollar less, imitation vanilla flavor.

904
00:45:52,574 --> 00:45:55,154
Now what's the difference between these things?

905
00:45:55,154 --> 00:45:57,175
You think, oh well, one comes from real vanilla.

906
00:45:57,467 --> 00:46:00,467
The other, I don't know, comes from some lab, whatever.

907
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:02,768
It's something that smells like vanilla,

908
00:46:02,768 --> 00:46:04,188
but is in no way vanilla.

909
00:46:04,188 --> 00:46:07,209
And that is completely wrong.

910
00:46:07,209 --> 00:46:10,710
In truth, both of them contain the same thing.

911
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:13,651
A bunch of vanillin molecule, C8H8O3,

912
00:46:13,651 --> 00:46:16,872
suspended in an alcohol solution.

913
00:46:16,872 --> 00:46:19,513
That's what both of these are.

914
00:46:19,513 --> 00:46:21,873
The only difference is where it comes from.

915
00:46:21,873 --> 00:46:24,734
The pure vanilla extract comes from the vanilla plant.

916
00:46:24,734 --> 00:46:26,675
The imitation vanilla flavor.

917
00:46:27,197 --> 00:46:31,380
comes from a process of pouring acid on paper pulp that just happens to create this same

918
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:32,240
molecule.

919
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,202
But you're getting exactly the same thing.

920
00:46:35,202 --> 00:46:41,025
Well, not exactly the same thing, because the imitation stuff is actually pure.

921
00:46:41,025 --> 00:46:47,649
It's nothing but alcohol and vanilla molecule, whereas the pure vanilla extract is not pure.

922
00:46:47,649 --> 00:46:53,913
It has all this extra junk that is not vanilla that comes from the vanilla plant but is not

923
00:46:53,913 --> 00:46:55,333
the thing that smells like vanilla.

924
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:59,385
But the reason we favor that one is because of all that junk.

925
00:46:59,385 --> 00:47:01,806
We like all that weird rough junk.

926
00:47:01,806 --> 00:47:06,307
It makes everything feel broader and more interesting and more complex.

927
00:47:06,307 --> 00:47:11,368
So this is a case where purity actually gets you in trouble.

928
00:47:11,368 --> 00:47:12,389
Purity isn't as good.

929
00:47:12,389 --> 00:47:14,169
Roughness ends up being better.

930
00:47:15,025 --> 00:47:19,367
Who, for example, would pay to go and see the perfectly straight Tower of Pisa?

931
00:47:19,367 --> 00:47:21,368
Nobody would do that, right?

932
00:47:21,368 --> 00:47:23,910
It's the roughness that makes it interesting.

933
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:30,212
I once heard Peter Molyneux talk about the idea that the greatest difficulty for game

934
00:47:30,212 --> 00:47:31,253
artists is dirt.

935
00:47:31,253 --> 00:47:35,055
That getting things to look dirty is so hard.

936
00:47:35,055 --> 00:47:39,737
And it's true, and it's important to make things look dirty because they give things

937
00:47:39,737 --> 00:47:40,637
a roughness.

938
00:47:40,637 --> 00:47:42,778
In sports, any ball.

939
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:44,890
that you have in a sporting game.

940
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:46,971
They're not perfectly smooth.

941
00:47:46,971 --> 00:47:49,032
If they're ever touched by human hands,

942
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:50,813
they're not perfectly smooth.

943
00:47:50,813 --> 00:47:52,834
It's the roughness that defines them.

944
00:47:52,834 --> 00:47:55,875
The roughness is how we interact with them.

945
00:47:55,875 --> 00:47:57,736
Think of a game like Monopoly.

946
00:47:57,736 --> 00:47:59,277
What is Monopoly?

947
00:47:59,277 --> 00:48:00,497
It's a landlord simulator.

948
00:48:00,497 --> 00:48:03,498
You're gonna be a landlord and do landlord things.

949
00:48:03,498 --> 00:48:04,559
Okay, awesome.

950
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:06,320
What are the avatars gonna be?

951
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,841
All right, they're gonna be this.

952
00:48:08,841 --> 00:48:09,441
What?

953
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:14,844
Shouldn't they be that little Monopoly dude with the mustache and six different colors?

954
00:48:14,844 --> 00:48:15,045
Nope!

955
00:48:15,045 --> 00:48:20,646
There's going to be a hat and a battleship and a shoe and a d- what are you doing?

956
00:48:20,646 --> 00:48:24,666
What kind of screwed up game design is this?

957
00:48:24,666 --> 00:48:26,287
Right?

958
00:48:26,287 --> 00:48:32,448
And I often think of what Goethe said, all lyrical work must, as a whole, be perfectly

959
00:48:32,448 --> 00:48:37,229
intelligible, but in some particulars a little unintelligible.

960
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:43,738
I'm sure he was thinking about Monopoly when he wrote that.

961
00:48:43,738 --> 00:48:51,663
If Minecraft was all beautiful, polished environments, would it be better?

962
00:48:51,663 --> 00:48:53,844
No. No. The roughness is important.

963
00:48:53,844 --> 00:48:55,164
Okay, pattern 12, echoes.

964
00:48:55,164 --> 00:48:59,827
Echoes is an interesting idea. I love this little hut.

965
00:48:59,827 --> 00:49:01,388
I think it's in Turkey here, this little house.

966
00:49:01,388 --> 00:49:04,670
And you see these sort of echoes of design.

967
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:06,050
Look at how the roof caps...

968
00:49:06,433 --> 00:49:08,815
echo each other even though they're a little different from each other.

969
00:49:08,815 --> 00:49:14,419
And then even the doorway has a very similar shape and angle to the roof peaks.

970
00:49:14,419 --> 00:49:16,580
And it kind of connects everything together.

971
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:21,084
So Alexander often talks about making sure the angles of different things are connected

972
00:49:21,084 --> 00:49:22,965
and that helps bring an overall connectedness.

973
00:49:22,965 --> 00:49:27,808
His counter example is this interesting building actually created by Michelangelo.

974
00:49:28,499 --> 00:49:31,260
But when you look at this building, it's not really great.

975
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:34,340
Like nothing connects to anything else very well.

976
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,500
The angles are all different.

977
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,021
The shapes are all different.

978
00:49:37,021 --> 00:49:38,961
It's a little bit of a hodgepodge.

979
00:49:38,961 --> 00:49:42,682
There's a big overall symmetry for no good reason.

980
00:49:42,682 --> 00:49:44,562
And then there's these local symmetries,

981
00:49:44,562 --> 00:49:47,203
but nothing connects and it just doesn't feel so great.

982
00:49:47,203 --> 00:49:50,123
So in games we do this all the time.

983
00:49:50,123 --> 00:49:52,464
We did this in our Water Bears VR game.

984
00:49:52,464 --> 00:49:54,684
We'd had this initial tablet-based game

985
00:49:54,684 --> 00:49:56,145
called Water Bears, which was all about.

986
00:49:56,498 --> 00:49:58,719
bringing colored water to these cute little water bears.

987
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:00,119
And we made a VR version.

988
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:02,400
And we said, wow, this is so relaxing to play this.

989
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,781
Since it's a relaxing game, let's

990
00:50:04,781 --> 00:50:06,222
put it in a relaxing setting.

991
00:50:06,222 --> 00:50:08,903
So we put it in this kind of Caribbean setting.

992
00:50:08,903 --> 00:50:10,583
It's very relaxing.

993
00:50:10,583 --> 00:50:13,524
It kind of echoes the nature of the gameplay.

994
00:50:13,524 --> 00:50:15,985
A less relaxing game, Night in the Woods,

995
00:50:15,985 --> 00:50:20,047
is also full of echoes.

996
00:50:20,047 --> 00:50:23,828
This is a game that is all about growing up,

997
00:50:23,828 --> 00:50:24,488
moving from.

998
00:50:24,802 --> 00:50:29,945
the world of childhood to the world of adulthood and how you have to give things up in order

999
00:50:29,945 --> 00:50:30,685
to do that.

1000
00:50:30,685 --> 00:50:37,950
And so in doing so, they made the characters all very cartoony, childlike characters, but

1001
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:44,694
they put them in very adult situations, thus kind of echoing the whole theme and sort of

1002
00:50:44,694 --> 00:50:46,295
playing up that contrast.

1003
00:50:46,295 --> 00:50:50,338
Another great example of echoes I like is Cuphead.

1004
00:50:51,436 --> 00:50:55,621
Cuphead, even though it's, you know, maybe not the deepest game narrative in the world,

1005
00:50:55,621 --> 00:51:02,188
it has a really nice connection between what you do in the game and the overall story.

1006
00:51:02,188 --> 00:51:03,809
So really, what's Cuphead about?

1007
00:51:03,809 --> 00:51:07,073
This is a game about jumping into danger, right?

1008
00:51:07,073 --> 00:51:10,776
So our story is that these two cup-headed brothers...

1009
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:13,051
They were gambling with the devil.

1010
00:51:13,051 --> 00:51:14,952
They knew it was dangerous, right?

1011
00:51:14,952 --> 00:51:17,353
But they jumped right in and they gambled with the devil.

1012
00:51:17,353 --> 00:51:20,015
They lost, so they lost their souls.

1013
00:51:20,015 --> 00:51:20,875
So what's the solution?

1014
00:51:20,875 --> 00:51:23,337
The devil says, well, I've got a bunch of people

1015
00:51:23,337 --> 00:51:25,198
I need you to collect contracts from.

1016
00:51:25,198 --> 00:51:26,398
It's gonna be super dangerous.

1017
00:51:26,398 --> 00:51:28,780
And they're like, all right, let's go do it.

1018
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:30,881
And so they go and jump into danger.

1019
00:51:30,881 --> 00:51:32,922
Here's an example of some danger jumping here.

1020
00:51:32,922 --> 00:51:36,684
Right, so this game is so freaking hard.

1021
00:51:36,684 --> 00:51:37,725
You see that little pink thing?

1022
00:51:37,725 --> 00:51:39,045
That's actually kind of important.

1023
00:51:41,177 --> 00:51:41,878
Boink.

1024
00:51:41,878 --> 00:51:43,161
Jumping on those pink things.

1025
00:51:43,161 --> 00:51:47,832
So those pink things are what's in the game.

1026
00:51:47,832 --> 00:51:48,995
It's called a parry move.

1027
00:51:49,482 --> 00:51:51,284
Those pink things will kill you.

1028
00:51:51,284 --> 00:51:54,086
If you just jump on them, you'll just die.

1029
00:51:54,086 --> 00:51:57,129
But if you time it just right, right here,

1030
00:51:57,129 --> 00:51:58,730
you can take a look, here's some more of them.

1031
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:01,252
If you time it just right and you hit the jump button

1032
00:52:01,252 --> 00:52:03,354
a second time while you're in the air,

1033
00:52:03,354 --> 00:52:05,496
your character spins a little bit, turns pink,

1034
00:52:05,496 --> 00:52:07,537
and then will hit the pink thing

1035
00:52:07,537 --> 00:52:11,461
and build up all these bonus attacks that you can use later.

1036
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:13,002
If this was me doing this scene,

1037
00:52:13,002 --> 00:52:14,763
I would have died six times by now.

1038
00:52:15,159 --> 00:52:20,101
because I would have hit the parry button at the wrong time and hit the ghost and I'd be dead.

1039
00:52:20,101 --> 00:52:23,763
So you've got a story all about characters who jump into danger

1040
00:52:23,763 --> 00:52:29,806
and then you have a central mechanic that is about literally jumping into danger.

1041
00:52:29,806 --> 00:52:34,048
And you could argue that these guys took this nature of echoes a little too far

1042
00:52:34,048 --> 00:52:38,530
because, you know, there they are, the Moldenhauer brothers.

1043
00:52:38,882 --> 00:52:43,904
You know, two brothers who initiated this game here,

1044
00:52:43,904 --> 00:52:47,685
and there's Maya, their cousin, kind of talking about it.

1045
00:52:47,685 --> 00:52:48,966
They jumped in on a thing.

1046
00:52:48,966 --> 00:52:51,767
They did not know what they were doing.

1047
00:52:51,767 --> 00:52:52,047
Right?

1048
00:52:52,047 --> 00:52:55,208
I mean, here's the initial frame from the Cuphead trailer.

1049
00:52:55,208 --> 00:52:56,569
You'll notice, coming 2015.

1050
00:52:57,252 --> 00:52:59,653
You had a game, I mean, and this is the second one,

1051
00:52:59,653 --> 00:53:00,954
the original trailer said coming 2014, right?

1052
00:53:00,954 --> 00:53:02,354
So this game was three years late,

1053
00:53:02,354 --> 00:53:05,575
and they never would have been able to do it

1054
00:53:05,575 --> 00:53:10,097
if they hadn't done a deal with Microsoft, right?

1055
00:53:10,097 --> 00:53:12,258
In order to do it, and I don't wanna say

1056
00:53:12,258 --> 00:53:13,979
Microsoft's like the devil, but like,

1057
00:53:13,979 --> 00:53:19,201
it's possible to take the Echo thing a little too far

1058
00:53:19,201 --> 00:53:21,361
is all I'm saying right there.

1059
00:53:21,361 --> 00:53:21,741
All right.

1060
00:53:25,585 --> 00:53:30,547
three more patterns here. One of them is the void. And this is a little bit of a strange pattern,

1061
00:53:30,547 --> 00:53:36,990
a void where nothing is there. This picture is a picture actually from my house when my wife and I

1062
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:40,992
moved into the house we live in about 15 years ago. We picked it up at, I don't know, Target or

1063
00:53:40,992 --> 00:53:46,274
Marshalls or something. We're like, oh, this looks kind of cool. And my fascination with this picture

1064
00:53:46,274 --> 00:53:51,696
is just never ending. Even though, what is it? It's just some leaves. But what gets me is that

1065
00:53:51,696 --> 00:53:52,476
black square.

1066
00:53:53,595 --> 00:53:57,037
Right? Close one eye and put a finger up and cover the black square.

1067
00:53:57,037 --> 00:54:00,219
And you'll see this is a completely unremarkable picture.

1068
00:54:00,219 --> 00:54:05,143
And then you take that finger away and you're like,

1069
00:54:05,143 --> 00:54:09,666
black square, what are you doing there?

1070
00:54:09,666 --> 00:54:10,887
Why are you there?

1071
00:54:10,887 --> 00:54:13,228
And this void pattern shows up in lots of places.

1072
00:54:13,228 --> 00:54:15,130
Every church has the void pattern inside it,

1073
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:18,072
because that's where important things happen.

1074
00:54:18,072 --> 00:54:20,353
The human heart, what does it have?

1075
00:54:20,353 --> 00:54:22,094
A lot of complex structure in there?

1076
00:54:22,094 --> 00:54:22,595
No, empty.

1077
00:54:22,954 --> 00:54:25,396
it's empty inside there, right?

1078
00:54:25,396 --> 00:54:28,819
The most important things are empty inside.

1079
00:54:28,819 --> 00:54:32,482
And part of the reason that's important

1080
00:54:32,482 --> 00:54:35,966
is because when you enter an empty space,

1081
00:54:35,966 --> 00:54:39,529
suddenly you become very important

1082
00:54:39,529 --> 00:54:43,032
and everything you do becomes very important.

1083
00:54:43,032 --> 00:54:44,513
We see this in the hero's journey.

1084
00:54:44,513 --> 00:54:46,735
There's always that moment of entering the cave, right?

1085
00:54:46,735 --> 00:54:48,196
The cave is this kind of empty space

1086
00:54:48,196 --> 00:54:51,339
where something very important is going to happen.

1087
00:54:51,528 --> 00:54:53,609
We see it in video games all the time.

1088
00:54:53,609 --> 00:54:56,070
Like, a boss monster battle never happens

1089
00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:57,711
in a linen closet.

1090
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:00,033
It always happens when you come into a big, empty space

1091
00:55:00,033 --> 00:55:04,475
and you're like, oh, I think things are going to happen

1092
00:55:04,475 --> 00:55:05,836
right now.

1093
00:55:05,836 --> 00:55:10,018
I see a bunch of local symmetries in an empty space

1094
00:55:10,018 --> 00:55:12,379
and I think, oh yeah, oh yeah,

1095
00:55:12,379 --> 00:55:13,980
something's going to happen right now.

1096
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:17,282
So the void is very important.

1097
00:55:17,282 --> 00:55:19,803
And of course, think about void in terms of storytelling.

1098
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:28,984
If we talk about positive and negative space being dialogue and silence, the use of silence

1099
00:55:28,984 --> 00:55:31,425
is often very, very powerful that way.

1100
00:55:31,425 --> 00:55:38,406
And many games, I think Undertale is a great example, have found clever ways to sort of

1101
00:55:38,406 --> 00:55:41,407
use silence in order to deliver power.

1102
00:55:41,407 --> 00:55:45,368
The 14th pattern is simplicity and inner calm.

1103
00:55:45,368 --> 00:55:50,449
The idea being that when...

1104
00:55:50,708 --> 00:55:56,294
everything unessential is stripped away and you only have what's needed,

1105
00:55:56,294 --> 00:56:00,158
there is a certain calm quality because nothing else is needed.

1106
00:56:00,158 --> 00:56:04,282
Everything is here, as simple as it can be, and there's a perfect

1107
00:56:04,282 --> 00:56:08,106
quality about it. These pillars holding up a shrine,

1108
00:56:08,106 --> 00:56:11,149
a Japanese shrine, are one of Alexander's

1109
00:56:11,149 --> 00:56:13,332
examples, and he points out that

1110
00:56:14,214 --> 00:56:17,036
These things are not trying to be what they are.

1111
00:56:17,036 --> 00:56:20,878
They're just usually serving an unusual purpose

1112
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:22,939
in the simplest way possible.

1113
00:56:22,939 --> 00:56:24,720
And that often gives them this sort of strength

1114
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:25,400
and inner calm.

1115
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,081
Now simplicity and complexity we talk about

1116
00:56:28,081 --> 00:56:30,123
all the time in games.

1117
00:56:30,123 --> 00:56:31,303
And it's tricky, right?

1118
00:56:31,303 --> 00:56:32,504
Because you hear people say,

1119
00:56:32,504 --> 00:56:34,105
oh I hate that game, it's too complex.

1120
00:56:34,105 --> 00:56:35,285
And you hear people say,

1121
00:56:35,285 --> 00:56:36,606
I hate that game, it's too simple.

1122
00:56:36,606 --> 00:56:37,666
Well, what does that mean?

1123
00:56:37,666 --> 00:56:40,388
Somewhere in the middle is right?

1124
00:56:40,388 --> 00:56:42,169
No, we know simple games are better,

1125
00:56:42,169 --> 00:56:43,530
except when it's the bad kind of simple.

1126
00:56:43,931 --> 00:56:45,953
What? What does that mean?

1127
00:56:45,953 --> 00:56:48,695
Well, part of the idea is there are two kinds of complexity.

1128
00:56:48,695 --> 00:56:50,856
One of them is innate complexity.

1129
00:56:50,856 --> 00:56:53,418
Believe it or not, what you're looking at right there

1130
00:56:53,418 --> 00:56:56,360
is a single board game experience.

1131
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:57,481
Someone took all these board games

1132
00:56:57,481 --> 00:56:59,943
and made one set of rules for how you play all of them

1133
00:56:59,943 --> 00:57:02,265
in a big connected sequence.

1134
00:57:02,265 --> 00:57:03,946
There is a lot of innate complexity.

1135
00:57:03,946 --> 00:57:07,709
Learning the rules takes quite some time there.

1136
00:57:07,709 --> 00:57:09,230
As opposed to a game like Go,

1137
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:12,452
which is a very complex game, but not.

1138
00:57:13,323 --> 00:57:19,508
innately. The complexity is emergent because of the clever way that the centers and the

1139
00:57:19,508 --> 00:57:24,591
patterns push up against each other. One of the best ways to build towards that kind of

1140
00:57:24,591 --> 00:57:30,156
simplicity is to give things multiple purposes. Again, going back to Pac-Man, because I just

1141
00:57:30,156 --> 00:57:36,641
love Pac-Man so much, the dots in Pac-Man, they seem so simple. They're just dots. Who

1142
00:57:36,641 --> 00:57:40,443
cares? But when you count up their purposes, there's many of them.

1143
00:57:41,174 --> 00:57:44,397
First, your goal. Eat all the dots on the level.

1144
00:57:44,397 --> 00:57:46,698
So now they've established my goal for the game.

1145
00:57:46,698 --> 00:57:51,302
They give me points, and points are my judgment of how good I am at the game.

1146
00:57:51,302 --> 00:57:53,423
They create a pleasing sound of progress.

1147
00:57:53,423 --> 00:57:57,146
Waka waka waka. Every time I eat a dot, no waka waka when I don't eat dots.

1148
00:57:57,146 --> 00:57:59,908
So you get this kind of nice feedback loop of progress.

1149
00:57:59,908 --> 00:58:03,110
This is how I get extra lives. I've got to eat dots to get points.

1150
00:58:03,110 --> 00:58:04,271
Points get me extra lives.

1151
00:58:04,271 --> 00:58:07,974
So in order to survive in the game, the dots make me survive.

1152
00:58:08,975 --> 00:58:10,375
And where's the progress meter?

1153
00:58:10,375 --> 00:58:11,656
I don't need a progress meter.

1154
00:58:11,656 --> 00:58:15,297
The dots simply, at a glance, show me my progress.

1155
00:58:15,297 --> 00:58:15,657
I don't need it.

1156
00:58:15,657 --> 00:58:16,837
They've solved that purpose.

1157
00:58:16,837 --> 00:58:19,038
And then they have a secret purpose

1158
00:58:19,038 --> 00:58:20,438
very few people know about.

1159
00:58:20,438 --> 00:58:23,159
Every time you eat a dot in Pac-Man,

1160
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:24,960
it slows you down just a little bit.

1161
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,541
It kicks you back just a little bit.

1162
00:58:27,541 --> 00:58:31,022
And that's enough to make you go just a little slower

1163
00:58:31,022 --> 00:58:33,243
down a dot hallway than an empty hallway.

1164
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:34,083
And guess what?

1165
00:58:34,083 --> 00:58:36,023
What speeds do the ghosts go?

1166
00:58:36,826 --> 00:58:41,208
The ghosts go a little slower than you in an empty hallway

1167
00:58:41,208 --> 00:58:44,209
and a little faster than you in a dot hallway.

1168
00:58:44,209 --> 00:58:47,630
So suddenly you have this very interesting strategic decision

1169
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:48,310
to make.

1170
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:52,932
The final pattern is not separateness.

1171
00:58:52,932 --> 00:58:54,472
What does that mean?

1172
00:58:54,472 --> 00:58:57,874
Well, he's talking about things being connected to each other

1173
00:58:57,874 --> 00:58:59,034
in a fundamental way.

1174
00:58:59,034 --> 00:59:00,455
I love this picture.

1175
00:59:00,455 --> 00:59:03,656
This picture he has of a path made of these stones connected

1176
00:59:03,656 --> 00:59:04,016
together.

1177
00:59:04,463 --> 00:59:06,764
And of course, so many of the patterns are seen here.

1178
00:59:06,764 --> 00:59:09,085
You see the stones are connected to the earth,

1179
00:59:09,085 --> 00:59:11,666
but all the stones are actually the same.

1180
00:59:11,666 --> 00:59:13,347
They're not different stones.

1181
00:59:13,347 --> 00:59:14,548
They're just turned at an angle.

1182
00:59:14,548 --> 00:59:15,988
They're all the same square.

1183
00:59:15,988 --> 00:59:18,310
So you have this perfect echo along them.

1184
00:59:18,310 --> 00:59:20,030
And then you have alternating repetition,

1185
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:20,991
and then you have a gradient,

1186
00:59:20,991 --> 00:59:22,071
and you have everything here.

1187
00:59:22,071 --> 00:59:23,632
Everything is connected.

1188
00:59:23,632 --> 00:59:26,193
And one of my favorite games in this regard

1189
00:59:26,193 --> 00:59:28,575
is Brothers, A Tale of Two Sons.

1190
00:59:28,575 --> 00:59:31,576
This is just a gorgeous, beautiful game,

1191
00:59:31,576 --> 00:59:32,437
and it's so clever.

1192
00:59:32,853 --> 00:59:35,635
The idea of it is these two brothers going on an adventure,

1193
00:59:35,635 --> 00:59:38,037
and you're going to control both of them.

1194
00:59:38,037 --> 00:59:41,720
And you do one with each one of your hands.

1195
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,641
One hand controls one brother, one hand

1196
00:59:43,641 --> 00:59:45,663
controls the other brother.

1197
00:59:45,663 --> 00:59:48,605
And you solve a lot of interesting puzzles and things

1198
00:59:48,605 --> 00:59:50,766
by moving these two brothers together.

1199
00:59:50,766 --> 00:59:53,829
Now, of course, this works with the human neurology,

1200
00:59:53,829 --> 00:59:57,491
because one hand is controlled by one half the brain,

1201
00:59:57,491 --> 01:00:00,874
the other hand is controlled by the other half of the brain.

1202
01:00:02,074 --> 01:00:05,996
And the only way they communicate is up the middle, up the corpus colossum there.

1203
01:00:05,996 --> 01:00:11,980
And so it's almost like the two halves of the brain, which sort of behave like siblings,

1204
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:14,141
now actually get to be siblings in the game.

1205
01:00:14,141 --> 01:00:18,484
And then, now I'm going to give a spoiler, cover your ears and sing if you really don't

1206
01:00:18,484 --> 01:00:21,606
want to know, something bad happens to one of the brothers.

1207
01:00:21,606 --> 01:00:29,330
And you'll never feel so alone in your life when suddenly that brother is gone because

1208
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:30,031
half of your brain.

1209
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:33,642
is now unable to participate in the game.

1210
01:00:33,642 --> 01:00:36,143
And then cleverly what happens next in the game

1211
01:00:36,143 --> 01:00:39,404
is so beautiful that I think it will make anyone cry.

1212
01:00:39,404 --> 01:00:44,207
And so it's a great example of deep interlock

1213
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:46,147
between the player's story and the game's story,

1214
01:00:46,147 --> 01:00:47,548
but it takes it farther.

1215
01:00:47,548 --> 01:00:51,150
It's not just the explicit story and the game's story,

1216
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:53,251
but it goes actually into the psychology

1217
01:00:53,251 --> 01:00:55,312
and even the neurology of the player.

1218
01:00:55,312 --> 01:00:56,912
And there's this beautiful connectedness

1219
01:00:56,912 --> 01:00:58,013
and non-separateness.

1220
01:00:58,475 --> 01:01:00,715
that happens between all three of these things.

1221
01:01:00,715 --> 01:01:04,456
And for me, this is why games that aren't just fun,

1222
01:01:04,456 --> 01:01:06,596
but games that actually change us as people,

1223
01:01:06,596 --> 01:01:08,417
games that educate, games that transform,

1224
01:01:08,417 --> 01:01:10,437
are so important.

1225
01:01:10,437 --> 01:01:11,997
Because great games, they change us,

1226
01:01:11,997 --> 01:01:16,758
and they make us better at connecting with each other,

1227
01:01:16,758 --> 01:01:20,919
and they make us better at connecting with the entire world,

1228
01:01:20,919 --> 01:01:23,780
which is kind of the ultimate in non-separateness.

1229
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:27,240
So there's the patterns, there's the 15 patterns.

1230
01:01:27,908 --> 01:01:32,552
We've only really scratched the surface talking about them. I hope you find some utility in thinking about them

1231
01:01:32,552 --> 01:01:39,057
I hope you find them useful and of course, we've only scratched the surface of the works of Christopher Alexander

1232
01:01:39,057 --> 01:01:44,042
So I hope you'll check out some of his works. There's so much to learn about there now at the beginning

1233
01:01:44,042 --> 01:01:48,045
I said that even though Alexander is obscure now that he would be famous in the future

1234
01:01:48,045 --> 01:01:55,331
I'd like to make a prediction about how that will happen. I think the way it will happen is

1235
01:01:55,331 --> 01:01:55,992
through AI

1236
01:01:55,992 --> 01:01:56,372
because

1237
01:01:56,837 --> 01:01:59,897
AIs are designed to make the world a better place,

1238
01:01:59,897 --> 01:02:01,998
and AIs love patterns.

1239
01:02:01,998 --> 01:02:06,619
Now very soon, all of you will be working closely with AIs,

1240
01:02:06,619 --> 01:02:09,220
because AIs are going to be such an important part of game

1241
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:11,221
narrative in the near future.

1242
01:02:11,221 --> 01:02:14,581
And so don't be too surprised when a few years from now,

1243
01:02:14,581 --> 01:02:17,402
when you're training up some AI to kind of be a character

1244
01:02:17,402 --> 01:02:20,903
in one of your games, the AI is like, hey, human,

1245
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:22,604
have you noticed these 15 patterns that

1246
01:02:22,604 --> 01:02:23,644
make everything better?

1247
01:02:23,644 --> 01:02:24,104
And you can be like.

1248
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:28,344
Yeah, robot, I know.

1249
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:31,771
That's how we made you.

1250
01:02:31,771 --> 01:02:32,172
Thanks.
