1
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:23,424
So, let me tell you a story that occurred, let's say, 10 years ago.

2
00:00:24,445 --> 00:00:31,146
I was working on Killzone 2 at the time and in this particular moment I was working on

3
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:32,467
the multiplayer ambiences.

4
00:00:32,947 --> 00:00:40,069
So you know, making boxes in Maya, making ambiences and putting them into the game and

5
00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:40,769
running through them.

6
00:00:41,535 --> 00:00:43,457
And just like, oh, this transition works nice.

7
00:00:43,517 --> 00:00:44,538
Put a spot sound there.

8
00:00:44,998 --> 00:00:46,480
Kind of the sound gardening.

9
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,541
It's really beautiful.

10
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:53,586
And then at one point, I hear this strange, high-pitched,

11
00:00:53,826 --> 00:00:55,688
weird sound somewhere.

12
00:00:56,028 --> 00:00:56,749
And then it was gone.

13
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:58,991
So I didn't think too much of it.

14
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:00,072
We were working hard.

15
00:01:00,092 --> 00:01:04,996
It was hard dev time, really focused, and just excited to

16
00:01:05,016 --> 00:01:08,359
be working on a title that was much anticipated, so a lot of

17
00:01:09,179 --> 00:01:09,460
energy.

18
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,768
but also a lot of hard work, so we're getting a little bit tired.

19
00:01:13,628 --> 00:01:15,008
And then continued working,

20
00:01:15,028 --> 00:01:18,749
and a little bit later I hear it again.

21
00:01:18,769 --> 00:01:23,450
This is kind of strange. I tried to figure out what it could be. I look at the

22
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,831
debug screens that we have,

23
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:27,331
I try to look at the sounds that I just added,

24
00:01:28,571 --> 00:01:31,672
are all the WAV files still okay, is there somewhere a glitch in there,

25
00:01:32,552 --> 00:01:35,753
are the converters versions of them all right, you know, and all the stuff you do to

26
00:01:35,793 --> 00:01:36,413
figure out what

27
00:01:37,174 --> 00:01:37,794
could be going on.

28
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,221
and then at a certain point it was gone again.

29
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:47,243
And I couldn't reproduce it. I tried to do it all the same places that I went to

30
00:01:47,303 --> 00:01:49,424
before. I tried to repeat my actions.

31
00:01:49,444 --> 00:01:50,884
I tried to remember what

32
00:01:51,284 --> 00:01:52,425
might possibly be it.

33
00:01:53,045 --> 00:01:54,045
But it didn't happen again.

34
00:01:55,286 --> 00:01:58,267
So I decided I'm just going to go down to the canteen.

35
00:01:58,807 --> 00:01:59,768
We have a nice little

36
00:02:00,908 --> 00:02:02,929
canteen at the time in the basement of the office.

37
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:05,710
And we had a chef there during crunchy times.

38
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,631
And he would cook great food. So I enjoyed the meal.

39
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:14,453
I come back to my room and open the door and I hear the sound again.

40
00:02:14,973 --> 00:02:19,555
So I go sit behind my desk and it turns out that my game is turned off.

41
00:02:20,676 --> 00:02:25,998
So alright, it's not in the game.

42
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:31,561
That was good news in a sense because at least I didn't have to worry about it too much

43
00:02:31,661 --> 00:02:34,963
in being in the ship title but still I think I had a problem.

44
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,920
You start to look at, is Windows still running fine?

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,261
Is there a driver conflict?

46
00:02:40,301 --> 00:02:41,581
It's like 10 years ago, right?

47
00:02:41,621 --> 00:02:45,402
So go to the amp, the dev kit.

48
00:02:45,462 --> 00:02:46,182
Is it all right?

49
00:02:46,202 --> 00:02:47,283
Yeah, everything's fine.

50
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:51,544
Well, then my live sound engineering background

51
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:52,024
kicked in.

52
00:02:52,064 --> 00:02:55,105
I used to work in a small theater and did sound there.

53
00:02:55,796 --> 00:02:58,258
And I started to follow the cables, right?

54
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,040
So is the cable from the DevKit to the amp all right?

55
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,320
Yes.

56
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,722
Is the signal coming through there?

57
00:03:03,962 --> 00:03:04,222
Great.

58
00:03:04,262 --> 00:03:05,623
Start to follow the speaker cable.

59
00:03:05,663 --> 00:03:08,165
And it seemed to always be coming from the front

60
00:03:08,806 --> 00:03:10,387
of the sound field.

61
00:03:10,987 --> 00:03:13,389
So I started with the left front speaker

62
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:14,850
and then jangled it a little bit.

63
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:18,233
And then I went to that center speaker right there

64
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:21,395
and I went underneath the desk with my hand

65
00:03:21,455 --> 00:03:23,717
and I touched the cable and it was sticky.

66
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,118
And I smelled it.

67
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:29,271
It smelled really, really bad, so that made me really curious.

68
00:03:29,691 --> 00:03:35,013
And I went underneath the desk, so I'm kind of going like that.

69
00:03:35,314 --> 00:03:40,416
I'm a bit tall and pretty cramped, and trying not to knock over the speakers or the monitors.

70
00:03:40,456 --> 00:03:45,878
But I went underneath and I followed the cable up, and I'm following the cable up,

71
00:03:46,179 --> 00:03:50,080
and I go up to the backside of the speaker, you know, that's the baseboard right there.

72
00:03:50,641 --> 00:03:55,103
And as I approach it, I hear this weird sound, and suddenly a family of mice appeared.

73
00:03:57,692 --> 00:03:59,093
So I had some roommates.

74
00:04:01,835 --> 00:04:03,056
This was crunchy times.

75
00:04:03,497 --> 00:04:06,959
We were in a very old office from the 17th century.

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,803
It's a very great building, but it was getting kind of funky.

77
00:04:13,345 --> 00:04:14,025
So welcome.

78
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:17,008
This is Zen and the Art of Game Audio Maintenance.

79
00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:23,614
This is Aloy in what I suspect is some kind of pose related

80
00:04:23,674 --> 00:04:24,214
to this topic.

81
00:04:24,985 --> 00:04:26,185
I'm Anton Wolteck.

82
00:04:26,465 --> 00:04:29,927
I'm celebrating 12 and a half years in game audio this year.

83
00:04:30,727 --> 00:04:33,948
And yeah, it all started actually right here in this room

84
00:04:34,328 --> 00:04:35,249
12 and a half years ago.

85
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:39,170
I still remember it as if it happened five minutes ago.

86
00:04:40,611 --> 00:04:42,851
These days though, I'm a principal sound designer

87
00:04:42,892 --> 00:04:44,492
at Guerrilla Games, and I've been working

88
00:04:44,512 --> 00:04:47,673
at Guerrilla Games for the past 11 years.

89
00:04:48,594 --> 00:04:52,855
And during those 11 years, in contrary to a previous speaker,

90
00:04:53,587 --> 00:04:56,008
I shipped four games, not a hundred.

91
00:04:56,848 --> 00:04:58,209
But they were nice games though.

92
00:04:58,269 --> 00:04:59,890
Killzone 2, like I was saying,

93
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,991
then on the PlayStation 3, Killzone 3,

94
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:03,051
also on the PlayStation 3.

95
00:05:03,812 --> 00:05:05,553
Then the launch title for the PlayStation 4,

96
00:05:05,853 --> 00:05:06,753
Killzone Shadowfall.

97
00:05:08,194 --> 00:05:10,835
And then the last game we released last year,

98
00:05:10,995 --> 00:05:11,976
Horizon Zero Dawn.

99
00:05:13,316 --> 00:05:18,199
And what I was gonna say is I'm not a Zen monk.

100
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:19,679
I am not a Buddhist.

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,640
I don't know much about philosophy.

102
00:05:23,555 --> 00:05:31,219
But about four years ago, I read this book by a guy called

103
00:05:31,299 --> 00:05:32,139
Robert Piercy.

104
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,742
And I was reading this book at the time that I was preparing

105
00:05:36,782 --> 00:05:39,544
a GDC talk about Killzone Shadowfall.

106
00:05:40,464 --> 00:05:45,487
And it really resonated with me in ways that were

107
00:05:45,627 --> 00:05:46,988
fundamental to who I am.

108
00:05:47,188 --> 00:05:50,490
And it took a little while to recognize what it was.

109
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:54,113
But I realized the book, when it came out in the 70s,

110
00:05:54,613 --> 00:05:58,096
it influenced a generation, particularly here in San

111
00:05:58,136 --> 00:06:00,919
Francisco, I would say, but all around the world

112
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,062
significantly in so many ways.

113
00:06:05,763 --> 00:06:08,005
But it influenced my parents' generation.

114
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:10,487
And I think probably for a lot of people in the room, their

115
00:06:10,527 --> 00:06:12,549
parents' generation was influenced by it.

116
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:17,353
And it's a difficult book to describe in this talk, so I'm

117
00:06:17,393 --> 00:06:18,634
not really going to do that.

118
00:06:19,118 --> 00:06:21,759
But one particular thing that caught my attention

119
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,122
was how he talked about our relationship with technology.

120
00:06:27,022 --> 00:06:29,824
And as I was doing this talk about the note graph system

121
00:06:29,864 --> 00:06:32,405
for Killzone Shadowfall, I started to reflect

122
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,786
upon my relationship with technology

123
00:06:35,126 --> 00:06:39,469
and start to think about things that might be shared

124
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:41,710
between all of us working in game audio.

125
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,511
So talking about that, our relationship

126
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,492
with game audio, with technology,

127
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,633
I would say we love it.

128
00:06:49,358 --> 00:06:51,999
Because the game is technology, right?

129
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:55,121
It enables our creative ambitions.

130
00:06:55,301 --> 00:06:58,322
We wouldn't be here without these high-tech dreams

131
00:06:58,382 --> 00:06:58,983
that we have.

132
00:06:59,683 --> 00:07:02,705
And it shows in how we treat technological objects

133
00:07:02,885 --> 00:07:04,666
as almost religious artifacts.

134
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,847
I've got my modular synthesizer that I'm obsessing about

135
00:07:07,887 --> 00:07:10,249
and spending way too much time and money on.

136
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:13,990
Damien's got his pedal boards that he's raving about

137
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:14,351
endlessly.

138
00:07:15,318 --> 00:07:20,301
A lot of you have plugins that you consider somewhat the holy grail of something.

139
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:26,845
But in any relationship where there's love, there can be hate.

140
00:07:27,465 --> 00:07:32,588
Because whenever you have something that doesn't do, doesn't deliver what you want to achieve

141
00:07:32,768 --> 00:07:37,631
creatively, where your ambitions are, then you can get really frustrated and angry with

142
00:07:37,671 --> 00:07:37,791
them.

143
00:07:38,172 --> 00:07:41,914
And when you are, you know, such as us, at the cutting edge of technology with games,

144
00:07:42,534 --> 00:07:44,095
that happens all the time.

145
00:07:46,354 --> 00:07:50,138
Also important in a relationship is trust.

146
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:51,799
That is key.

147
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:53,721
Without trust, you can never have

148
00:07:53,961 --> 00:07:55,282
any kind of good relationship.

149
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:59,466
So put a pin on that for a second.

150
00:08:00,087 --> 00:08:04,251
And let's talk a little bit about ambitions in games.

151
00:08:04,271 --> 00:08:07,434
Because I think games are really unique

152
00:08:07,774 --> 00:08:12,698
in that we have three really important ambitions.

153
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,515
First of all, like I was saying, technology, right?

154
00:08:15,555 --> 00:08:17,976
We're pushing that technology to the very, very edge.

155
00:08:18,616 --> 00:08:20,936
And it's so much fun to be riding that edge.

156
00:08:21,817 --> 00:08:22,697
It's really inspiring.

157
00:08:23,097 --> 00:08:25,878
But also we have these creative ambitions.

158
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,498
We want to make people cry when they play our games

159
00:08:28,618 --> 00:08:30,559
or whatever reaction we get out of them.

160
00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:33,419
That's also a really strong ambition a lot of us have.

161
00:08:34,619 --> 00:08:38,460
And of course, you know, we have kids and we want to eat

162
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,321
and we want to live in a nice place.

163
00:08:40,401 --> 00:08:41,481
We want to have stability.

164
00:08:41,927 --> 00:08:44,028
So our games have to make money.

165
00:08:44,068 --> 00:08:47,569
We're doing this also as a sustainable financial endeavor.

166
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:49,270
And you can never forget that too.

167
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,292
And I think, you know, when I think of this and I look at that,

168
00:08:54,472 --> 00:08:57,173
I know where I can place myself on that map.

169
00:08:57,694 --> 00:09:00,115
I can put myself somewhere in that triangle and say,

170
00:09:00,175 --> 00:09:03,816
this is where I will balance these three things for myself.

171
00:09:07,198 --> 00:09:10,219
And also the game I'm working on, I can put on that map.

172
00:09:10,895 --> 00:09:16,017
I can say the game I'm working on is also trying to achieve something here.

173
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,158
And it might be true for you as well.

174
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,879
And sometimes there is a discrepancy there.

175
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:27,821
You know, sometimes where we are and where our core ambitions are fundamentally as humans

176
00:09:27,841 --> 00:09:32,723
is radically different from the jobs that we have and where they want to go with that.

177
00:09:33,684 --> 00:09:39,166
And that sometimes can create large tensions, especially if you're not aware of it.

178
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:44,149
I think as long as you're aware of the thing you're working on being something fundamentally

179
00:09:44,229 --> 00:09:48,251
different from where you are, then you can find ways to deal with that.

180
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:55,555
Another thing is that you have your ambitions, the game has those ambitions, but you're not

181
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,555
doing this alone, right?

182
00:09:56,615 --> 00:10:01,738
Games is this hyper-collaborative process where you're constantly together making this.

183
00:10:02,378 --> 00:10:04,679
It has no real creative owner for a game.

184
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,601
Everybody is contributing so much to it.

185
00:10:08,421 --> 00:10:08,561
So...

186
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:13,096
everybody on the team is putting their dot somewhere too.

187
00:10:13,337 --> 00:10:16,157
And it might not be always in the same place as yours.

188
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:21,279
So that creates company culture, I think.

189
00:10:21,979 --> 00:10:24,200
Again, this is my bird's eye view

190
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,201
from these 12 and a half years.

191
00:10:26,281 --> 00:10:28,481
And maybe it is different from yours,

192
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,462
but maybe some stuff resonates well with you.

193
00:10:31,562 --> 00:10:36,364
So what I find is that you have

194
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,783
culture and game companies, somewhere in between the Rock Band and Law Firm Slider.

195
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:47,347
You know, on the one hand, the extreme, you have the studios that are

196
00:10:47,787 --> 00:10:51,030
all about creativity, no rules, just go,

197
00:10:52,131 --> 00:10:54,492
and whatever you need to do to achieve

198
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:58,075
that ambition. On the other hand, you have studios that are

199
00:10:58,676 --> 00:11:02,118
really structured and have all kinds of defined processes and

200
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:05,701
that's what gets their day and games out of the door in time, right?

201
00:11:06,261 --> 00:11:07,282
And you can put all kinds of...

202
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,360
markers on kinds of pluses and minuses that those company cultures bring.

203
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,960
But again, it's one of those things where

204
00:11:16,521 --> 00:11:16,801
if you

205
00:11:17,561 --> 00:11:23,722
know what your company culture is and you can see it clearly and you know what parts of it you like and don't like,

206
00:11:24,422 --> 00:11:28,883
you can also relax a little bit more. You can think about that and say okay, this is going on,

207
00:11:29,143 --> 00:11:31,503
but that's because this company is here and

208
00:11:32,203 --> 00:11:35,804
that is also something that made me pin for a second. Because

209
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:37,748
These are all kind of static.

210
00:11:37,768 --> 00:11:39,669
These things change slowly over time,

211
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:42,830
but you can say for any moment during game development,

212
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:43,911
they're kind of static.

213
00:11:45,511 --> 00:11:47,452
Game development has states.

214
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:51,474
And the ones who own the states of game development

215
00:11:51,514 --> 00:11:52,875
right now is the production team.

216
00:11:53,315 --> 00:11:55,536
Because they define pre-production,

217
00:11:56,056 --> 00:11:58,918
production, and maybe even a little bit of polish time.

218
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:02,780
But that is not my experience.

219
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:11,156
Those clear defined periods are not how I perceive the times I've spent making games.

220
00:12:11,336 --> 00:12:13,598
I see it more as a wave.

221
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:15,280
Oh, sorry about that.

222
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,942
I see it more as a wave.

223
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:26,689
So for me, at a certain point, I come into the office and suddenly I'm tense.

224
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:29,992
All my muscles tense up and I go, what's going on?

225
00:12:30,642 --> 00:12:33,804
This didn't happen yesterday, nothing bad happened on the way over here,

226
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:37,326
everybody said hi, what's going on? And then it turns out

227
00:12:37,886 --> 00:12:41,749
soon enough they'll figure out, wait, a lot of people around me are working very

228
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:43,210
hard and getting very focused

229
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,432
and the energy changes. And that's when I noticed,

230
00:12:47,532 --> 00:12:50,354
know that a wave is gonna come. So

231
00:12:51,055 --> 00:12:55,998
a wave has these three stages, the pre-wave period where you kind of see

232
00:12:56,038 --> 00:12:59,880
stuff building, then you're fully in it, you're focusing, focusing, focusing,

233
00:13:00,206 --> 00:13:02,106
And at a certain point, it crashes on the ocean

234
00:13:02,187 --> 00:13:04,387
or on the beach and it ebbs out.

235
00:13:05,587 --> 00:13:08,948
And what's important to realize,

236
00:13:09,148 --> 00:13:10,749
and this is also about that feeling thing,

237
00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:13,350
is that not everybody you're working with

238
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,850
is gonna be in the same state at the same time.

239
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:19,351
Some people are much further out at sea than you are,

240
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:22,912
and they're working on things you have no real sense of,

241
00:13:23,132 --> 00:13:24,313
particularly in sound, I think,

242
00:13:24,353 --> 00:13:26,853
because we're so far at the back end of projects.

243
00:13:27,854 --> 00:13:29,514
And you can also have multiple.

244
00:13:29,938 --> 00:13:30,899
waves during a project.

245
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:34,399
So, you know, sometimes there,

246
00:13:34,499 --> 00:13:36,200
but, sorry, you can have multiple waves,

247
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,160
but there's usually also one that is like the big one,

248
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,761
the one that defines the project.

249
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:44,261
But there will be the E3 demos and the things that just like

250
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:46,782
wash over you as well.

251
00:13:46,802 --> 00:13:50,602
But let's take a little bit of a closer look.

252
00:13:50,862 --> 00:13:52,743
So we can, I know this is kind of,

253
00:13:52,763 --> 00:13:56,484
well, let's take a bit of a closer look to the period

254
00:13:56,564 --> 00:13:59,064
before the wave comes, right?

255
00:13:59,724 --> 00:14:02,265
This period is highly chaotic.

256
00:14:02,646 --> 00:14:06,568
It's highly chaotic because there are so many questions you cannot answer.

257
00:14:07,528 --> 00:14:08,669
What game am I making?

258
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:09,889
Why is this thing there?

259
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,490
Is it going to be there in the end?

260
00:14:13,511 --> 00:14:19,314
But you know that you have to have as many answers as possible.

261
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:23,637
Because as soon as you are in this wave period,

262
00:14:24,477 --> 00:14:27,159
you're going to rely on those answers to inform your work.

263
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,120
Now-

264
00:14:30,481 --> 00:14:32,702
During a wave, there is also chaos.

265
00:14:33,603 --> 00:14:34,464
A lot of it, actually.

266
00:14:34,784 --> 00:14:39,407
And it comes from deadlines, scope changes, unexpected changes,

267
00:14:39,507 --> 00:14:41,748
all these external factors that you cannot control.

268
00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:45,111
The only thing you really know during this time

269
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:49,013
is that there's no way you're going to do everything that you want to do.

270
00:14:49,614 --> 00:14:52,495
Those three ambitions that we talked about in the beginning,

271
00:14:52,836 --> 00:14:54,497
they are fighting for your attention,

272
00:14:54,677 --> 00:14:58,059
and during this time, it's impossible to really achieve all of them.

273
00:14:58,952 --> 00:15:02,414
And that's also really good to be aware of, I found.

274
00:15:04,415 --> 00:15:10,358
So, during this time, my focus starts to narrow deeply.

275
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,440
I start to focus on the particular task I'm working on,

276
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,322
like making an ambient and testing the ambient transitions.

277
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:20,364
And that is, that just happens, right?

278
00:15:20,744 --> 00:15:21,925
But because of that,

279
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:25,186
your communication skills start to decrease

280
00:15:25,547 --> 00:15:27,828
because your focus is so much on

281
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:31,758
what you want to achieve, that communicating about those things

282
00:15:32,038 --> 00:15:34,999
becomes harder and harder. And it goes for more people

283
00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:39,040
in the company that you're working for. Another thing that happens

284
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,100
is that your perception changes. You're focusing so much on the one particular

285
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:43,460
thing

286
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,461
or things or whatever, that

287
00:15:46,981 --> 00:15:51,102
sometimes you get these gaps in your perception and issues that were

288
00:15:51,122 --> 00:15:54,682
that easy to spot when you were not in this time

289
00:15:55,502 --> 00:15:57,723
are somehow escaping your attention.

290
00:15:58,302 --> 00:16:00,562
and they can suddenly hit you when you least expect them.

291
00:16:01,943 --> 00:16:04,663
So that sounds maybe a bit of a downer,

292
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:08,985
but actually, this is the time where you get to achieve your ambitions.

293
00:16:09,465 --> 00:16:11,085
And that is the nice part about this.

294
00:16:11,165 --> 00:16:13,066
This is where you get all the energy from

295
00:16:13,226 --> 00:16:17,867
to really achieve that dream that you have for whatever you're working on.

296
00:16:19,428 --> 00:16:25,550
Now, then the wave passes in whatever form that might happen.

297
00:16:26,621 --> 00:16:30,024
And one thing that will happen is your audience will react.

298
00:16:30,844 --> 00:16:32,206
And that reaction is chaotic.

299
00:16:32,246 --> 00:16:33,767
You don't know how they're going to react.

300
00:16:34,267 --> 00:16:36,069
They could be positive, negatives.

301
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:37,650
There could be all kinds of things

302
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,571
that you never thought of.

303
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:41,273
But the certainty that you have from that chaos

304
00:16:41,693 --> 00:16:43,855
is that you're going to get lots of new information

305
00:16:44,555 --> 00:16:45,716
from so many players.

306
00:16:45,937 --> 00:16:48,779
It's really going to inform the work that you've done.

307
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,143
So I said I would also make it a little bit more practical.

308
00:16:54,203 --> 00:16:55,845
And so I wanted to share.

309
00:16:56,341 --> 00:17:01,682
some of the things that I found that can help me in these three different stages, states

310
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:12,445
of a project. In the pre-wave period, I found it critical to verify my signal chain. So

311
00:17:12,785 --> 00:17:18,046
what I mean by that is, first of all, draw it out as detailed as possible. This is a

312
00:17:18,066 --> 00:17:18,447
bit of a

313
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:22,132
rough sketch of your game engine going into your dev kit,

314
00:17:22,173 --> 00:17:24,593
going into your amp, going into your AD converter,

315
00:17:24,633 --> 00:17:26,734
this is a particular example for my current setup,

316
00:17:27,134 --> 00:17:29,255
going into a MADI router, et cetera, et cetera,

317
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,955
until it reaches your brain.

318
00:17:32,015 --> 00:17:35,236
And make this as detailed as you can possibly make it.

319
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:38,437
Go out and describe every step in your game audio engine.

320
00:17:39,678 --> 00:17:41,798
And then put a test sound at the start.

321
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:46,100
I might suggest a pink noise at minus 12 dB full scale.

322
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,840
Play it at the beginning.

323
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:48,680
And then.

324
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,423
get towards the end and see if it still comes out the same way.

325
00:17:53,263 --> 00:17:56,746
I suspect for a lot of people in the room that might not be the case.

326
00:17:57,367 --> 00:18:01,310
Some processes in between will change the signal, will make it softer,

327
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:05,473
or might even change the frequency spectrum because of phase cancellations,

328
00:18:05,694 --> 00:18:10,097
all kinds of things can happen, right? There's so many things in between.

329
00:18:11,378 --> 00:18:14,521
So, when that happens, don't panic,

330
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:17,363
just try to figure out where could it come from.

331
00:18:17,817 --> 00:18:19,457
and try to take out steps.

332
00:18:19,797 --> 00:18:21,758
So play the sound directly from your amp.

333
00:18:22,058 --> 00:18:23,839
Is the ping noise working directly from your amp?

334
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:26,119
Great, and it's not everything behind it,

335
00:18:26,259 --> 00:18:27,600
it must be before it, right?

336
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,621
At a certain point, and this might take half a minute,

337
00:18:31,941 --> 00:18:34,242
if you're lucky, or it might take months,

338
00:18:34,642 --> 00:18:36,303
as was my case, after Killzone 3,

339
00:18:36,963 --> 00:18:38,903
and the amount of bugs we found in our engine

340
00:18:38,983 --> 00:18:42,004
by simply doing this was staggering and funny.

341
00:18:44,554 --> 00:18:46,135
Because we're in this pre-wave period, right?

342
00:18:46,175 --> 00:18:48,075
We could just do this in our leisurely pace.

343
00:18:50,776 --> 00:18:52,737
So, once you've done that,

344
00:18:52,897 --> 00:18:55,978
and you have a certain confidence, calibrate it.

345
00:18:56,618 --> 00:18:58,439
Minus 12 dB full-scale pink noise

346
00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:01,520
should be a certain amount of dB SPL

347
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,241
on your speakers in your room.

348
00:19:04,501 --> 00:19:05,001
78, for example.

349
00:19:05,081 --> 00:19:05,981
Whatever works for you.

350
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:09,362
I don't think there's one number that should be adhered to.

351
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,963
What that gives you is something to recalibrate to.

352
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:19,653
And recalibrating regularly is what builds trust.

353
00:19:20,713 --> 00:19:21,394
That's what we want.

354
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,082
Taking it a bit further, what if you take that ping noise

355
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:36,084
and then trigger it directly from the game?

356
00:19:36,945 --> 00:19:39,727
So you don't need your audio tools to trigger it.

357
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,229
You just have a debug menu in your game,

358
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,690
and all it does is trigger a sound that

359
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:45,871
is your calibration signal.

360
00:19:46,951 --> 00:19:48,832
What that gives you is the ability

361
00:19:49,092 --> 00:19:50,933
to test your setup somewhere else.

362
00:19:51,474 --> 00:19:52,814
You know this signal now, right?

363
00:19:52,854 --> 00:19:54,515
You've calibrated your studio, so you

364
00:19:54,555 --> 00:19:55,556
know how it should come back.

365
00:19:56,036 --> 00:19:58,437
Now we can go anywhere in the dev team

366
00:19:58,878 --> 00:20:01,479
and see if it actually is represented the same way there.

367
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,482
Recently, for example, I was in our review space,

368
00:20:06,542 --> 00:20:08,242
which is a nice little cinema for 12 people.

369
00:20:09,362 --> 00:20:13,205
great surround setup, and we were reviewing the game

370
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:16,407
in the current state, and we felt like something is off

371
00:20:16,847 --> 00:20:18,869
in the front field again.

372
00:20:19,389 --> 00:20:23,132
And we were discussing, was it this makes change,

373
00:20:23,172 --> 00:20:25,114
that makes change, no, that doesn't make any sense.

374
00:20:25,514 --> 00:20:28,036
At a certain point, I had the clarity of mind to figure,

375
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,378
let's just play the test sound.

376
00:20:30,478 --> 00:20:33,320
And the test sound is simply a white noise or pink noise

377
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,402
panning around the full circle.

378
00:20:35,942 --> 00:20:37,723
As soon as it reached the left front speaker,

379
00:20:39,024 --> 00:20:39,604
It was dull.

380
00:20:40,524 --> 00:20:41,065
What happened?

381
00:20:41,085 --> 00:20:42,886
The tweeter of the speaker had blown.

382
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:47,208
That saved us hours of debating what it could be.

383
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:49,909
It was hard to perceive a tweeter being blown

384
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:52,771
on a full-range giant Bauer and Wilkins system,

385
00:20:53,731 --> 00:20:55,272
and now it was that easy.

386
00:20:55,913 --> 00:20:58,274
But only because we could trust this test signal

387
00:20:58,634 --> 00:20:59,535
because we knew it so well.

388
00:21:01,656 --> 00:21:03,857
The third thing in the pre-wave period you can do

389
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:08,800
is to identify and engage your allies within the team.

390
00:21:09,952 --> 00:21:15,175
So I think there's three different kinds of allies that I like to have.

391
00:21:15,235 --> 00:21:17,576
The first one is a wicked repeal magician.

392
00:21:17,636 --> 00:21:23,900
So this is the special person who can just magically find the way to reproduce that issue

393
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,161
from happening that you haven't been able to find out.

394
00:21:27,382 --> 00:21:32,884
For the last game that happened to be, my intern Nick, who was a magician for doing

395
00:21:32,904 --> 00:21:37,467
this with weapon sounds, and our game director Matthijs de Jong, who would come with the

396
00:21:37,527 --> 00:21:37,807
most.

397
00:21:39,281 --> 00:21:42,543
beautiful music-triggering bugs that haunt me still.

398
00:21:44,544 --> 00:21:47,246
You also need somebody with a very sharp analytical mind,

399
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,687
so somebody that you can give a logic issue

400
00:21:50,508 --> 00:21:51,689
and then instantly tells me,

401
00:21:51,729 --> 00:21:53,149
yeah, but you're missing that step there.

402
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:56,171
That can save you so much time.

403
00:21:57,612 --> 00:22:01,034
The third one I need is a trusty creative ear.

404
00:22:01,515 --> 00:22:03,616
Now, again, this doesn't need to be a sound person.

405
00:22:03,936 --> 00:22:06,077
This is somebody whose creative opinion you trust.

406
00:22:07,018 --> 00:22:08,859
And you build this relationship.

407
00:22:09,737 --> 00:22:14,960
during the pre-wave period because as soon as you go into the wave period and you get

408
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,463
hyper-focused and your communication skills decrease, then finding somebody that you trust

409
00:22:20,764 --> 00:22:26,787
and explaining the issue or just hearing their feedback and receiving it is very hard unless

410
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:31,730
they already have some kind of relationship with you and you understand each other.

411
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:35,692
So see if you can get these kinds of people around you.

412
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:40,050
So the wave hits you, and I'm sorry to say,

413
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:43,011
there's not a lot of things you can do, I found.

414
00:22:43,371 --> 00:22:45,051
But what I noticed happens is,

415
00:22:45,472 --> 00:22:47,032
at some point I'm working hard,

416
00:22:47,352 --> 00:22:49,393
by my desk, this is at my current studio,

417
00:22:49,713 --> 00:22:51,334
happily chapping away, and suddenly,

418
00:22:51,354 --> 00:22:53,094
I hear something wrong,

419
00:22:53,975 --> 00:22:55,975
and my instinct tells me at this point,

420
00:22:56,295 --> 00:22:58,116
quick, run, I need help.

421
00:22:59,516 --> 00:23:01,517
So, before you do that,

422
00:23:02,157 --> 00:23:03,958
realize you are hyper-focused.

423
00:23:04,018 --> 00:23:05,138
Some people call this maybe,

424
00:23:07,683 --> 00:23:13,146
Flow state, either way, your instincts

425
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:14,467
are sometimes misleading you.

426
00:23:15,307 --> 00:23:18,709
Take a second and ask yourself some questions.

427
00:23:19,569 --> 00:23:22,211
And I'm going to very quickly run through some suggestions

428
00:23:22,311 --> 00:23:24,492
and I promise I will upload my slides too.

429
00:23:25,933 --> 00:23:27,854
Is your signals chain still calibrated?

430
00:23:28,174 --> 00:23:29,675
Are you missing something obvious?

431
00:23:30,235 --> 00:23:31,276
What does my content do?

432
00:23:32,157 --> 00:23:33,717
How is my content being triggered?

433
00:23:34,258 --> 00:23:35,538
And what does the debug tell me?

434
00:23:35,928 --> 00:23:37,870
And could the debug be lying to me?

435
00:23:38,711 --> 00:23:39,091
It does.

436
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,073
When did you hear something similar?

437
00:23:43,294 --> 00:23:45,956
And now, who are you going to talk to about this?

438
00:23:46,536 --> 00:23:48,878
Why are you going to talk to that person about this?

439
00:23:49,499 --> 00:23:51,760
And what would she do, or tell you?

440
00:23:52,401 --> 00:23:53,262
How stressed am I?

441
00:23:54,963 --> 00:23:55,944
What is my weakness?

442
00:23:57,305 --> 00:23:58,285
And what is my strength?

443
00:24:00,587 --> 00:24:03,169
Good things to ask yourself before you run off in a hurry.

444
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:07,881
The reason for that is, of course, those other people are also hyper-focused, likely.

445
00:24:08,301 --> 00:24:11,943
So you're taking away from their chance to reach their ambitions.

446
00:24:12,503 --> 00:24:13,503
So be mindful of that.

447
00:24:15,064 --> 00:24:17,866
So, then there's some things you can do.

448
00:24:18,306 --> 00:24:19,766
Just let some time go by, right?

449
00:24:20,207 --> 00:24:23,008
Just let some time go by. It might become clearer.

450
00:24:24,108 --> 00:24:26,369
Or just capture it and play it back.

451
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,070
That gives you a new perspective, too.

452
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:30,754
Start over from a blank canvas.

453
00:24:31,114 --> 00:24:32,654
Works great for logic issues.

454
00:24:32,955 --> 00:24:36,395
Throw it away, get a cup of coffee, come back, try again.

455
00:24:37,896 --> 00:24:39,836
Read the revision history in Perforce.

456
00:24:40,077 --> 00:24:43,658
That is such a gold mine of information in there.

457
00:24:45,298 --> 00:24:47,539
What you see is not what you hear,

458
00:24:48,339 --> 00:24:49,179
or the other way around.

459
00:24:49,419 --> 00:24:52,060
So turn off your screen and just listen.

460
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,401
Or turn off your speakers and just watch.

461
00:24:55,421 --> 00:24:57,502
Because those eyes and those ears

462
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:01,278
that influence you in ways that your brain doesn't know about.

463
00:25:01,298 --> 00:25:02,619
It happens subconsciously.

464
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,841
So just separate them.

465
00:25:05,281 --> 00:25:07,803
And sometimes that gives you really important clues

466
00:25:07,843 --> 00:25:08,784
of what might be going on.

467
00:25:12,927 --> 00:25:16,109
Isolate your problem as much as possible.

468
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:19,592
Get away as much of the other things around you.

469
00:25:19,692 --> 00:25:22,734
So put it into a test level with absolutely nothing.

470
00:25:24,015 --> 00:25:25,877
Get rid of anything else attached to it.

471
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,141
have that one trigger in there and then, you know,

472
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:32,222
it's still not solvable.

473
00:25:34,382 --> 00:25:34,782
Reboot.

474
00:25:37,463 --> 00:25:38,943
Okay, and then you can go talk to somebody.

475
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:43,264
The other thing that I like to do

476
00:25:47,565 --> 00:25:49,145
is to keep a log of what I do.

477
00:25:49,425 --> 00:25:52,386
So every day, as I do things, I just type out,

478
00:25:52,706 --> 00:25:54,707
worked on this sound, talked with that person.

479
00:25:55,235 --> 00:25:57,836
Very short, no details, just type it out.

480
00:25:58,276 --> 00:26:01,518
And then, when I notice a gap in my perception,

481
00:26:01,658 --> 00:26:03,920
so I have an issue that eluded me for a while,

482
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,661
and I was like, why didn't I realize that sooner?

483
00:26:07,221 --> 00:26:09,523
I write down, this is the issue I had,

484
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:11,844
I thought I should have noticed this sooner.

485
00:26:12,885 --> 00:26:15,486
File away, forgive yourself, move on.

486
00:26:15,926 --> 00:26:17,988
This is your time to reach your goals.

487
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:20,689
Don't worry about it, it's a waste of time at this point.

488
00:26:21,129 --> 00:26:22,030
We'll come back to it later.

489
00:26:23,691 --> 00:26:23,811
So.

490
00:26:25,548 --> 00:26:26,769
it crashes ashore, right?

491
00:26:27,809 --> 00:26:29,829
And when you're working on a deadline,

492
00:26:30,169 --> 00:26:32,610
you don't always make the nicest assets.

493
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,650
The players don't mind, they don't care

494
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:37,451
if your Y sounds are all horribly named

495
00:26:37,731 --> 00:26:40,851
or if my graph sounds look like a horrible mess of wires.

496
00:26:41,591 --> 00:26:42,111
They don't care.

497
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:45,132
But you should care for yourself on the next project,

498
00:26:45,852 --> 00:26:48,012
if you're gonna maybe reuse those assets.

499
00:26:48,953 --> 00:26:51,213
Because those are the assets that are gonna give you bugs

500
00:26:51,353 --> 00:26:53,873
on the next project, and you're gonna hate your old self.

501
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,701
for not cleaning up when you still have plenty of time.

502
00:26:58,301 --> 00:27:02,602
So refactor them, throw them away if you're not going to use them anymore,

503
00:27:02,963 --> 00:27:04,603
but get rid of the cruft.

504
00:27:06,343 --> 00:27:08,604
Now, the second thing to do in a post-wave period

505
00:27:09,084 --> 00:27:14,145
is to look at the bugs that you've marked for this thing on your list,

506
00:27:14,726 --> 00:27:20,207
and then start to design ways to help yourself find these bugs sooner.

507
00:27:21,207 --> 00:27:23,388
Help yourself and create processes that...

508
00:27:24,324 --> 00:27:29,768
do that. Now, you might notice that what I'm talking about now is something that you could

509
00:27:29,828 --> 00:27:34,872
apply to that signal chain thing that I was doing and that test sound thing. All of these

510
00:27:34,932 --> 00:27:42,858
things come from these kinds of processes. And that was already happening naturally for

511
00:27:42,898 --> 00:27:47,641
me. But once I started to reflect on it, it really made me realize how important it is.

512
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:53,997
And important to realize that it's good to focus on the things that make sense in the state that you're currently in.

513
00:27:54,617 --> 00:28:00,000
It doesn't make sense to worry about your processes or your signals chain too much when you're in a wave period.

514
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,942
Just roll with it and go. You've got the tools you built before, you've got to live with it now. Make it work.

515
00:28:06,823 --> 00:28:11,005
But, don't forget about the issues you're having during the wave period.

516
00:28:11,165 --> 00:28:14,647
Because it's so easy and you don't realize this when you're so focused.

517
00:28:15,095 --> 00:28:17,335
You think this is so important, I'm never going to forget it,

518
00:28:17,355 --> 00:28:18,976
it was so terrible, it was so terrible,

519
00:28:19,096 --> 00:28:22,316
but as soon as the wave is over, it's all gone.

520
00:28:23,097 --> 00:28:25,837
I don't remember any of the painful stuff I had to endure

521
00:28:25,917 --> 00:28:27,178
during any of the projects I did,

522
00:28:27,518 --> 00:28:30,318
because as soon as it's out, it's all forgotten and forgiven.

523
00:28:30,718 --> 00:28:31,659
It's not a thing anymore.

524
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:33,779
So write it down with a little note,

525
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,240
and then you remember, oh yeah, that was really terrible.

526
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,660
And then you start to design processes

527
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,621
to prevent you from being in the same boat again.

528
00:28:40,881 --> 00:28:41,841
You want to have a better boat.

529
00:28:43,401 --> 00:28:43,521
So.

530
00:28:44,842 --> 00:28:47,604
What I would love to hear is other people's MyStories.

531
00:28:48,665 --> 00:28:50,987
And I hope this talk gives you a chance

532
00:28:51,067 --> 00:28:55,190
to maybe be a little bit more zen in your daily work.

533
00:28:56,211 --> 00:28:56,511
Thank you.
