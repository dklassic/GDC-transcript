1
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:08,290
All right.

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:08,830
Hey, everybody.

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,132
Thank you very much for coming out today.

4
00:00:11,132 --> 00:00:12,773
My name is Zeke Verant.

5
00:00:12,773 --> 00:00:14,934
And I developed Softbody by myself

6
00:00:14,934 --> 00:00:16,835
over the course of about 2 and 1⁄2 years.

7
00:00:16,835 --> 00:00:19,837
So I'm going to be doing a post-mortem today

8
00:00:19,837 --> 00:00:22,218
about some of its split-mind design principles

9
00:00:22,218 --> 00:00:23,659
that I implemented into the game.

10
00:00:23,659 --> 00:00:28,041
So the game just came out last May on PlayStation 4 and on PC.

11
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:29,943
So I'm sure there's a few people in the audience

12
00:00:29,943 --> 00:00:31,123
who haven't had a chance to play it.

13
00:00:31,936 --> 00:00:34,718
don't really know that much about the game.

14
00:00:34,718 --> 00:00:37,641
So I just want to give everybody a sense of what the game looks

15
00:00:37,641 --> 00:00:39,302
like, so I'm going to play a short gameplay trailer,

16
00:00:39,302 --> 00:00:41,944
and then we'll go straight into the talk.

17
00:00:41,944 --> 00:00:42,345
So here we go.

18
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:51,361
Okay, so Soft Body is this kind of chilled out but very difficult action game in which

19
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:58,903
you control two beautiful gooey snakes at the same time.

20
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:02,734
It's heavily influenced by a lot of action games,

21
00:02:02,734 --> 00:02:05,535
especially like shmups and twin stick shooters.

22
00:02:05,535 --> 00:02:07,056
But I tried to introduce a number of mechanics

23
00:02:07,056 --> 00:02:09,677
that are a little bit unique to action games.

24
00:02:09,677 --> 00:02:11,718
Stuff like painting the world with your body

25
00:02:11,718 --> 00:02:13,278
as opposed to shooting.

26
00:02:13,278 --> 00:02:15,379
And there's also a lot of level variation.

27
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:18,500
So there being, as well as being like bullet hell levels

28
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,782
with like tons of layers to paint and navigate through.

29
00:02:21,782 --> 00:02:25,503
There's also these sort of ethereal contemplative levels

30
00:02:25,503 --> 00:02:27,844
that have a slower vibe to them as well.

31
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:34,473
But soft body, the thing I'm most interested in the game and the thing I'm probably most

32
00:02:34,473 --> 00:02:38,235
proud of is the split mind design mechanics that I ended up implementing into the game.

33
00:02:38,235 --> 00:02:42,798
In other words, like controlling two snakes at the same time.

34
00:02:42,798 --> 00:02:46,880
So when people first do this, it seems like it's something that's mentally impossible.

35
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:53,064
It feels like your brain is trying to actively resist doing the thing that you want to do

36
00:02:53,064 --> 00:02:55,505
and what the game wants.

37
00:02:55,855 --> 00:03:01,397
wants you to do. It's just kind of a very challenging task. So I always felt this mechanic

38
00:03:01,397 --> 00:03:05,499
was interesting, but it actually took me a long time before I was able to wholeheartedly

39
00:03:05,499 --> 00:03:09,641
introduce it into the game. So even after I played a great game like Brothers, A Tale

40
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:13,722
of Two Sons, which I think did an amazing job pushing this controlling two things at

41
00:03:13,722 --> 00:03:20,385
the same time mechanic, I was still a bit at a loss at how I could make it work for

42
00:03:20,385 --> 00:03:20,985
SoftBody.

43
00:03:23,592 --> 00:03:26,514
But after more than a year of gradual development,

44
00:03:26,514 --> 00:03:29,276
I fully embraced the brain splitting challenge

45
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:31,638
of controlling these two things at the same time.

46
00:03:31,638 --> 00:03:33,820
And I ended up implementing a new mode into the game,

47
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,542
the aptly named hard mode, hard game mode.

48
00:03:36,542 --> 00:03:40,485
So this hard game mode has a very high skill ceiling

49
00:03:40,485 --> 00:03:43,247
and it requires an immense amount of concentration

50
00:03:43,247 --> 00:03:45,209
from the player almost all the time they're playing.

51
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:48,191
But designing hard game really helped me refocus

52
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:49,732
the game's level design and fine tune

53
00:03:49,732 --> 00:03:50,953
the game's difficulty curve.

54
00:03:51,293 --> 00:03:54,814
And it really reinvigorated my work on the game,

55
00:03:54,814 --> 00:03:56,955
including, on the rest of the game,

56
00:03:56,955 --> 00:04:01,537
including like the tutorial and the introductory mode.

57
00:04:01,537 --> 00:04:04,818
So today we're gonna do this post-mortem in three parts.

58
00:04:04,818 --> 00:04:06,278
So the first part is Soft Game.

59
00:04:06,278 --> 00:04:09,279
And Soft Game kind of covers the first year,

60
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:10,940
year and a half of development.

61
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,641
I'm gonna go into how my process kind of gradually generated

62
00:04:14,641 --> 00:04:17,042
you know, these game elements that worked really well,

63
00:04:17,042 --> 00:04:18,943
but actually didn't...

64
00:04:19,207 --> 00:04:21,628
And they were kind of appealing the first time you're playing around with them, but

65
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,888
they didn't really work well together.

66
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:27,049
And so the game was kind of conceptually muddled.

67
00:04:27,049 --> 00:04:30,309
In hard game, I'm going to delve into all the work that I had to do in order to sort

68
00:04:30,309 --> 00:04:36,331
of untangle that mess and refocus the game and kind of crystalline the design a bit.

69
00:04:36,331 --> 00:04:41,312
And finally, I'm going to wrap it up with a split-mind pedagogy, which will try to

70
00:04:41,312 --> 00:04:45,712
give some useful takeaways from this kind of like otherwise esoteric idea.

71
00:04:45,712 --> 00:04:47,513
All right.

72
00:04:47,513 --> 00:04:47,593
So...

73
00:04:48,206 --> 00:04:50,387
Part one, designing by tasting.

74
00:04:50,387 --> 00:04:52,288
Okay, before I talk about Softbody,

75
00:04:52,288 --> 00:04:54,889
I wanna show you a game I was working on right before.

76
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:58,050
So this is a screenshot from Money Money.

77
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,971
It's an ambitious narrative game.

78
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:02,372
It's got lots of characters,

79
00:05:02,372 --> 00:05:04,692
and it's got a whole bunch of dialogue,

80
00:05:04,692 --> 00:05:06,773
and a bunch of meticulously crafted

81
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,454
black and white pixel art.

82
00:05:08,454 --> 00:05:09,334
You know, and of course,

83
00:05:09,334 --> 00:05:11,755
you can play as three different characters.

84
00:05:11,755 --> 00:05:13,296
And, you know, it's just sprawling.

85
00:05:13,296 --> 00:05:15,177
It's all over the place.

86
00:05:16,171 --> 00:05:19,792
When I finally sat down to try to create something out of this content,

87
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:23,773
I mean, the obvious thing happened is that it just wasn't playable.

88
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:27,654
Nothing I was doing was actually useful for a game experience.

89
00:05:27,654 --> 00:05:29,915
And so I would have to kind of rework it.

90
00:05:29,915 --> 00:05:36,216
And I did this once, and then the second time through I just decided I was going to take a break for a little while.

91
00:05:36,216 --> 00:05:39,117
You know, I decided I was going to try to do something completely different

92
00:05:39,117 --> 00:05:43,738
and make a game that was just designed entirely around a core of interactivity,

93
00:05:43,738 --> 00:05:44,198
where I'm...

94
00:05:45,203 --> 00:05:52,185
at the very start, like, working with movement, working with objectives in the game.

95
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,945
So basically an action game.

96
00:05:53,945 --> 00:05:55,726
And this is what I came up with.

97
00:05:55,726 --> 00:06:01,827
So in the first few days of prototyping Soft Body, I got this beautiful gooey snake.

98
00:06:01,827 --> 00:06:06,108
And I don't know, I just immediately kind of liked it.

99
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:09,229
It's very simple and it felt really good to move around.

100
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:11,190
And actually, this is what it is.

101
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,330
It's just a bunch of circles being spawned.

102
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:18,792
And so you get a circle that like spawns every frame,

103
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:19,512
and then that circle,

104
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,353
the circle's radius will then grow for 10 frames,

105
00:06:22,353 --> 00:06:25,715
and then the circle's radius will start to shrink.

106
00:06:25,715 --> 00:06:26,395
And then every frame,

107
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:29,436
there's about a 4% chance for the circle to start wobbling.

108
00:06:29,436 --> 00:06:31,577
And this is what gives the snake,

109
00:06:31,577 --> 00:06:35,499
it's kind of like gooey, organic feeling, the wobble.

110
00:06:36,505 --> 00:06:38,187
So I like this for two reasons.

111
00:06:38,187 --> 00:06:43,510
One, it's pretty, but also strange and lifelike and

112
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,752
adorable, but not cute.

113
00:06:45,752 --> 00:06:48,414
So a visual thing.

114
00:06:48,414 --> 00:06:53,017
But the main thing was it just was a joy to control the body,

115
00:06:53,017 --> 00:06:55,358
especially with a controller.

116
00:06:55,358 --> 00:06:59,461
In fact, I would say that analog sticks really

117
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,943
played a huge role in shaping soft bodies development.

118
00:07:01,943 --> 00:07:04,224
And I've always really, really loved analog sticks.

119
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:05,525
They feel amazing.

120
00:07:06,284 --> 00:07:11,288
Especially on the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One, these new ones, it has such a smooth

121
00:07:11,288 --> 00:07:11,608
action.

122
00:07:11,608 --> 00:07:14,911
I feel like you can do almost anything on an analog stick and it feels good.

123
00:07:14,911 --> 00:07:20,656
You can move it in a really fast circle or a slow circle around the barrier.

124
00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:25,400
I like the gentle resistance of the spring when you're pushing it in a direction.

125
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,063
So I felt like I'd stumbled onto a great way of designing the core of the game.

126
00:07:29,063 --> 00:07:32,587
I could just design the game around what felt good to do with a controller.

127
00:07:34,597 --> 00:07:36,537
And so at first, development was centered

128
00:07:36,537 --> 00:07:37,457
around a single question.

129
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,958
How can I make movement feel rewarding and great?

130
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:44,219
So of course the controls were the central part of this,

131
00:07:44,219 --> 00:07:46,580
but I was trying to design obstacles and enemies

132
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,841
that would encourage movement and sort of reinforce that,

133
00:07:49,841 --> 00:07:51,941
and also give some personality to the game.

134
00:07:51,941 --> 00:07:54,042
So from the shape of bullet patterns,

135
00:07:54,042 --> 00:07:56,502
like having them as circles or semi-circles

136
00:07:56,502 --> 00:07:58,723
so that people would move in a circle

137
00:07:58,723 --> 00:08:00,003
as opposed to in a straight line

138
00:08:00,003 --> 00:08:01,364
and they're just pushing themselves

139
00:08:01,364 --> 00:08:02,564
in some certain direction.

140
00:08:02,992 --> 00:08:07,654
to the sound when you paint walls, to the way that I designed like certain enemies.

141
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:12,356
You know, from the beginning all these small refinements were meant to accentuate movement.

142
00:08:12,356 --> 00:08:17,518
And so here's a clip right now of like an enemy I designed in which, yeah, it's completely

143
00:08:17,518 --> 00:08:22,681
designed so that you're always circling it and that's like the fun thing that I found

144
00:08:22,681 --> 00:08:23,121
you could do.

145
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:23,221
But

146
00:08:27,672 --> 00:08:30,934
what I actually define as rewarding and great.

147
00:08:30,934 --> 00:08:33,616
What does this actually mean to me?

148
00:08:33,616 --> 00:08:34,637
So of course it's like, you know,

149
00:08:34,637 --> 00:08:36,659
there's the games mechanics and there's rules.

150
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,801
So like, there's stuff that's great when it's like,

151
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:40,802
oh, it's not fussy when you paint a wall

152
00:08:40,802 --> 00:08:42,784
because the like painting radius is really big.

153
00:08:42,784 --> 00:08:45,266
Yeah, that's rewarding and great.

154
00:08:45,266 --> 00:08:46,867
And others, you know, small stuff

155
00:08:46,867 --> 00:08:48,789
that are about the aesthetics and whatnot.

156
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:51,831
But really there was also this like emotional appeal

157
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,192
that I was trying to go for.

158
00:08:54,816 --> 00:08:58,918
So with games like Kerypt and Fez, I felt like there was something that was much more

159
00:08:58,918 --> 00:09:01,820
compelling than just like the mechanics in place.

160
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:07,263
Like Fez, for instance, whenever I see a screenshot, I kind of have this feeling, you know, it

161
00:09:07,263 --> 00:09:12,887
kind of evokes this musical memory, like this time I spent with a game and I don't know,

162
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:15,528
it's kind of like hearing an old song and remembering where you were at the time.

163
00:09:15,528 --> 00:09:19,010
And I think Fez does that really, really, really well.

164
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,992
On the other hand, like something like Kerypt...

165
00:09:21,443 --> 00:09:25,146
is this really strange mood, and it's about puzzles,

166
00:09:25,146 --> 00:09:28,588
but even before you've solved a puzzle,

167
00:09:28,588 --> 00:09:32,411
even before you've gotten to the real gist of the game,

168
00:09:32,411 --> 00:09:35,513
it's still compelling, you still want to keep playing it,

169
00:09:35,513 --> 00:09:38,135
not just because it feels good to move around.

170
00:09:38,135 --> 00:09:40,297
So it was important to me that the game

171
00:09:40,297 --> 00:09:43,059
wasn't just some design fetishy achievement and elegance,

172
00:09:43,059 --> 00:09:45,760
but that it would have some sort of emotional energy as well,

173
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,783
especially since I was really searching to find,

174
00:09:49,499 --> 00:09:52,782
energy to keep prototyping after this awful money money experience.

175
00:09:52,782 --> 00:09:57,648
So it is kind of strange to me though, I was thinking about this when I was putting the

176
00:09:57,648 --> 00:10:02,994
talk together, it's like I talk so much about like making the game feel great and like building

177
00:10:02,994 --> 00:10:07,539
it around these, this you know, controllers, really simple concept, it sounds so elegant,

178
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:09,461
it sounds so like minimalist.

179
00:10:10,285 --> 00:10:16,012
You know, with all this energy spent on the controls and the tight movement and the fluid feelings and stuff,

180
00:10:16,012 --> 00:10:20,857
why would I choose to pursue this really intense challenge of controlling two things at the same time?

181
00:10:20,857 --> 00:10:26,803
It's something that seems to be completely in the opposite of a kind of a chilled out experience.

182
00:10:27,904 --> 00:10:32,126
I don't know if I have the greatest answer, but, you know, I was trying to make stuff,

183
00:10:32,126 --> 00:10:35,288
but I wasn't trying to, without overthinking it, you know.

184
00:10:35,288 --> 00:10:39,931
Part of staying in this great creative mind space was the possibility of having some kind

185
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:43,113
of like wishful thinking and wishful features.

186
00:10:43,113 --> 00:10:48,057
You know, I had to kind of convince myself that even if I was obvious, even if a feature

187
00:10:48,057 --> 00:10:53,000
was obviously out of place, if I felt strongly enough about it, I thought that I would be

188
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,661
able, through some sort of gradual unconscious...

189
00:10:56,147 --> 00:11:00,009
conscious explorations, I would be able to find a way to make it work.

190
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:05,831
And so, instead of going through a big planning process, I decided to continue prototyping

191
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:10,953
in this kind of exploratory sense, you know, I guess prototyping built on ignorance and

192
00:11:10,953 --> 00:11:14,075
energy with a goal but no real plan how to get there.

193
00:11:14,075 --> 00:11:20,057
Essentially, I was trying to make it, development was a bit wishful in general.

194
00:11:20,057 --> 00:11:22,638
And this is, here.

195
00:11:23,463 --> 00:11:26,605
I've got the wishful features idea all planned out here.

196
00:11:26,605 --> 00:11:27,986
So this is how I,

197
00:11:27,986 --> 00:11:30,048
because there's a number of these things in it.

198
00:11:30,048 --> 00:11:31,249
I'm not going to go over everything,

199
00:11:31,249 --> 00:11:35,132
like all of the failed problems with like adding in

200
00:11:35,132 --> 00:11:38,414
a narrative or trying to do co-op mode.

201
00:11:38,414 --> 00:11:40,336
So those were wishful features,

202
00:11:40,336 --> 00:11:42,738
but some of them really did work.

203
00:11:42,738 --> 00:11:44,639
So you introduce this like promising feature.

204
00:11:45,945 --> 00:11:48,347
If it isn't great, you leave it in anyway.

205
00:11:48,347 --> 00:11:51,449
You don't, like, it's, if it works, then it's like, yeah, great, I'm the best in the world.

206
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:53,911
If it doesn't work, then you say, no sweat, we'll see what happens.

207
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:56,954
It's kind of like leaving a bug in your game.

208
00:11:56,954 --> 00:12:00,436
I said, Sal, Salski, is that how you say his name?

209
00:12:00,436 --> 00:12:04,099
He did a talk once about, like, how he just likes to leave bugs all over his game,

210
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:07,141
because it's just like, he finds some inspiration, they'll give him a good idea.

211
00:12:07,141 --> 00:12:10,304
And it's, I don't know, I've kind of, I, I, resonated with me, so.

212
00:12:11,219 --> 00:12:13,180
This was my way of doing it, I guess.

213
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:18,042
Leave in these big features that didn't make any sense.

214
00:12:18,042 --> 00:12:19,182
And then, you know, just hope for epiphany, you know?

215
00:12:19,182 --> 00:12:23,824
So back to controlling two things at the same time.

216
00:12:23,824 --> 00:12:25,885
We haven't talked about that in a little while.

217
00:12:25,885 --> 00:12:28,926
So I was starting to build a game out.

218
00:12:28,926 --> 00:12:32,127
I had this thing where you could paint walls.

219
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,748
It looks nice.

220
00:12:33,372 --> 00:12:41,478
It was very important to me that it wasn't fussy or frustrating, like that painting radius is quite big, so you didn't have to get too close to the wall.

221
00:12:41,478 --> 00:12:49,223
And yeah, and then you had this like kind of mechanic where you're pushing a ball along a rail.

222
00:12:49,223 --> 00:12:52,005
And this is sort of where...

223
00:12:53,246 --> 00:12:54,908
the two-body stuff started to come together.

224
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:58,250
So, I had a couple of mechanics.

225
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,692
So, I had the ball, I had the painting,

226
00:13:00,692 --> 00:13:02,414
and then I have, finally,

227
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,535
this thing where you actually just attach.

228
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:08,739
So, actually, I've relegated the,

229
00:13:08,739 --> 00:13:11,601
like, the second body as just a kind of a power-up.

230
00:13:11,601 --> 00:13:15,124
And I wasn't really, you know, I wasn't really...

231
00:13:15,877 --> 00:13:19,659
doubling down on this idea of controlling two things at the same time. I hadn't really

232
00:13:19,659 --> 00:13:24,401
pushed it too far, because every time I tried to do it, it just felt like, awkward, and

233
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:28,583
you know, the one body would get on the other side of the screen from this one, so like

234
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:33,105
suddenly I get confused and my brain doesn't like it. And so these were problems I had,

235
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:40,169
and I just wasn't, I guess I wasn't hard-headed enough to want to just sit down and try to

236
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:43,531
figure out what the real problem was. And so we have these...

237
00:13:44,352 --> 00:13:51,654
the three mechanics, paint, push and pop. And at the moment, you know, we got controlling

238
00:13:51,654 --> 00:13:57,196
two things at the same time, not all the time, but it's working. It's kind of working. We

239
00:13:57,196 --> 00:14:01,517
paint a level, that level changes. Oh, now we can get the power up and kill the enemy

240
00:14:01,517 --> 00:14:06,478
because that's what the power up allows you to do. And I don't know. It just wasn't really

241
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:11,440
a lot of people when they played around with it, if they ‑‑ I wasn't pushing them

242
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,860
towards it. So why is this in the game? Why is this in the game?

243
00:14:14,298 --> 00:14:18,761
And it's kind of what I got over and over for the first year of development, but being

244
00:14:18,761 --> 00:14:21,123
what I was, but I did really enjoy doing it.

245
00:14:21,123 --> 00:14:26,546
It was something I was slowly getting better at and gradually like finding my way to figuring

246
00:14:26,546 --> 00:14:31,530
that it was a good thing, but I just hadn't made a big step mechanically to like introduce

247
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:31,970
it.

248
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:38,454
So controlling two things at the same time, but not quite all the time.

249
00:14:38,454 --> 00:14:38,494
So

250
00:14:41,686 --> 00:14:47,193
Now we're going to go into part two. So about 15 months into development, you know, I had

251
00:14:47,193 --> 00:14:51,598
these great mechanics, you know, you could paint stuff, you could pop stuff, you could

252
00:14:51,598 --> 00:14:57,425
push stuff in the rail, and there was a whole lot of enemies that, but a lot of this stuff

253
00:14:57,425 --> 00:15:00,810
didn't feel good. It was like there were some fun levels.

254
00:15:01,146 --> 00:15:03,928
But the whole of the game wasn't coherent.

255
00:15:03,928 --> 00:15:05,929
It wasn't well organized.

256
00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:07,230
And it was maybe good enough for me

257
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:10,032
to feel okay about the first 20 or 30 minutes about the game,

258
00:15:10,032 --> 00:15:11,754
but the late game was repetitious.

259
00:15:11,754 --> 00:15:16,217
I was using the same turrets with the same bullet patterns,

260
00:15:16,217 --> 00:15:17,838
just more of them.

261
00:15:17,838 --> 00:15:19,939
And I was using more rails.

262
00:15:19,939 --> 00:15:22,581
And so it just began to felt like just longer levels

263
00:15:22,581 --> 00:15:24,783
of the first 15 levels.

264
00:15:28,467 --> 00:15:32,609
But instead of doubling down and working on better levels and working on more mechanics

265
00:15:32,609 --> 00:15:36,951
and really trying to figure this out, I'd gotten in this bad place where I was still

266
00:15:36,951 --> 00:15:41,013
doing these kind of wishful features, which had really served me well, I thought, at the

267
00:15:41,013 --> 00:15:42,734
beginning.

268
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,195
Not with this part, but with other parts.

269
00:15:44,195 --> 00:15:54,040
And I started making these kind of narrative parts that really didn't further the game.

270
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,922
They weren't getting to what was going to finish it.

271
00:15:58,268 --> 00:16:02,969
during the early developments my my i during early development my ideas about leaving stuff in the

272
00:16:02,969 --> 00:16:08,931
game to see if it gets better was starting to feel uninspired and i started working on other

273
00:16:08,931 --> 00:16:14,292
stuff other than like soft body's main levels and you know trying stuff out like a co-op mode which

274
00:16:14,292 --> 00:16:20,734
i knew immediately it didn't work but i knew it and i knew it wouldn't work without more work and

275
00:16:20,734 --> 00:16:24,215
but at least it was closer to the game itself i guess there was all this muck that i was like

276
00:16:24,215 --> 00:16:26,656
kind of walking through and i was just like

277
00:16:28,043 --> 00:16:33,066
way behind on designing the levels and all the work I was doing was just sort of this

278
00:16:33,066 --> 00:16:38,029
short-term distraction, you know, like some sort of a plot twist. Yeah, suddenly you're

279
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:45,373
a worm inside someone's brain. I mean, it was kind of cool, but it wasn't actually anything.

280
00:16:45,373 --> 00:16:53,378
And so, you know, I ended up where I am now. It's just like, what am I doing? I'm just

281
00:16:53,378 --> 00:16:56,780
not, I don't have the right way of going about this right now.

282
00:16:58,027 --> 00:17:01,567
just playing around and suddenly, you know, I mean, this co-op mode, I mean, is a pretty

283
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:05,728
good idea. It's a weird idea, right? You know, you're playing co-op mode, but you're only

284
00:17:05,728 --> 00:17:09,569
controlling one snake and you're playing it with your brother or something and he likes

285
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:15,831
it and you kind of like it. Well, you know, you keep doing that. We keep, we kept sitting

286
00:17:15,831 --> 00:17:20,552
with the co-op mode and playing through it until I actually did have one great epiphany

287
00:17:20,552 --> 00:17:24,353
was that if I played co-op mode, I could actually just play it by myself.

288
00:17:25,576 --> 00:17:30,198
And this was so much better than trying to design something where we had to try to communicate

289
00:17:30,198 --> 00:17:33,500
and try to design all these other features, you know?

290
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:39,222
And when I first did it, it was just the oddest experience.

291
00:17:39,222 --> 00:17:43,724
I could physically feel part of my brain kind of rewiring itself.

292
00:17:43,724 --> 00:17:43,985
And so...

293
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:51,481
I finally got sick of exploration, and one day I just sat down, I had this co-op mode,

294
00:17:51,481 --> 00:17:54,363
and I was like, okay, I'm going to start outlining the game's challenges.

295
00:17:54,363 --> 00:18:00,847
I'm going to start to figure out, like, what I can do to, like, make—what is actually

296
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:07,611
going on with controlling two things at the same time that is really, really difficult.

297
00:18:07,611 --> 00:18:08,832
And so, we have hard game mode.

298
00:18:08,832 --> 00:18:11,974
Oh, oh wait, the slide's out of place.

299
00:18:11,974 --> 00:18:12,514
Okay.

300
00:18:12,514 --> 00:18:12,574
So.

301
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:21,375
The challenges as they were outlined is we have using two snakes at the same time. So this

302
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:26,099
would be something like this mode here. Apologize. Okay. So this is someone trying to play

303
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:32,464
through it. And notice they're not moving them really at the same time. So one just kind of

304
00:18:32,464 --> 00:18:40,711
hides and the other one does all its obstacles. And then when this gets done, they're going to

305
00:18:41,395 --> 00:18:43,336
only when they get right close to each other again,

306
00:18:43,336 --> 00:18:45,616
and then that one will hide, and then it will go do things.

307
00:18:45,616 --> 00:18:47,617
So there was all these problems with trying to implement

308
00:18:47,617 --> 00:18:49,037
this kind of like co-op mode,

309
00:18:49,037 --> 00:18:50,677
already on top of the single player mode,

310
00:18:50,677 --> 00:18:53,778
because people just wanted to make it easier.

311
00:18:53,778 --> 00:18:54,978
They wanted to make it easier.

312
00:18:54,978 --> 00:18:57,179
There was nothing pushing them to actually approach

313
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:00,399
these like incredibly intense challenges.

314
00:19:00,399 --> 00:19:03,520
And so I started outlining what these challenges were.

315
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,921
There's using two snakes at the same time.

316
00:19:05,921 --> 00:19:08,341
Like just not hiding something,

317
00:19:08,341 --> 00:19:10,161
or movement at the same time.

318
00:19:11,205 --> 00:19:16,189
any sort of thing in that way. Crossing the snakes, this is a big one actually. So you're

319
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:20,352
controlling, everyone's trying to keep the snake that they control with the left analog stick on

320
00:19:20,352 --> 00:19:23,415
the left side of the screen and they're trying to keep the snake they control with the right

321
00:19:23,415 --> 00:19:28,139
analog stick on the right side of the screen. And whenever they cross those over, people just

322
00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:33,083
get all mixed up and they really have a hard time with it and they die immediately. So I needed

323
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:37,407
to figure out some way to introduce these challenges that where people could figure out how

324
00:19:37,407 --> 00:19:39,348
to do it and they weren't just constantly like

325
00:19:40,077 --> 00:19:44,878
into and such a big environment where they could try to just cheese it. You know, and

326
00:19:44,878 --> 00:19:49,680
they would, and then keeping distance from each other was also just another big problem.

327
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:54,021
And so I had to figure out ways, how can I get people to use them at the same time, how

328
00:19:54,021 --> 00:19:58,662
can I make them cross the snakes, and how can I force them to stay away from each other?

329
00:19:58,662 --> 00:20:04,544
And all the while making it kind of fun? And so these kind of like challenges actually

330
00:20:04,544 --> 00:20:08,185
started to become real mechanics. I just started designing mechanics and obstacles.

331
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:13,355
around what was difficult in the game. So in this particular one, well, first of all,

332
00:20:13,355 --> 00:20:21,544
soft and hard game mode, if either snake gets killed, it's game over. So in the other mode,

333
00:20:21,544 --> 00:20:26,108
it's like the other snake, if it gets hurt, it just, like, has a cool down period and then you

334
00:20:26,108 --> 00:20:31,373
can use it again. But this one's really brutal. So you're forcing people to always be

335
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:36,432
cognizant of what they're doing with both snakes.

336
00:20:36,432 --> 00:20:37,812
And then you have this line going around

337
00:20:37,812 --> 00:20:41,395
that if they like touch it, then one of the snakes pops.

338
00:20:41,395 --> 00:20:44,336
So you're forcing them to move around in a circle.

339
00:20:44,336 --> 00:20:46,177
And it's something that I just do it slow enough

340
00:20:46,177 --> 00:20:47,078
that it's not too hard.

341
00:20:47,078 --> 00:20:48,899
And this was another one I put together for,

342
00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:49,939
oh, is that not starting?

343
00:20:49,939 --> 00:20:50,360
Sorry about that.

344
00:21:05,072 --> 00:21:10,617
Okay, and this was another way of forcing people to keep their bodies further apart.

345
00:21:10,617 --> 00:21:16,721
So this was a level they have to not touch that circle that's surrounding the left body.

346
00:21:16,721 --> 00:21:23,466
And so it forces them to kind of be and keep in mind where they are, what the other body

347
00:21:23,466 --> 00:21:27,430
is doing, and not try to do this thing where they're moving in a path together because

348
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:30,832
they're just pushing the analog sticks in the same direction.

349
00:21:33,402 --> 00:21:36,565
And so, and then this one is like a combination of those two.

350
00:21:36,565 --> 00:21:38,946
So, after I put these in the early part of the game,

351
00:21:38,946 --> 00:21:40,848
then we have these parts where,

352
00:21:40,848 --> 00:21:42,509
okay, you just have to stay in these circles,

353
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,851
it'll rotate, and you have to keep distance.

354
00:21:44,851 --> 00:21:46,572
And this is usually the level that people

355
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:47,613
start to really get upset with me.

356
00:21:47,613 --> 00:21:48,293
Is that gonna play?

357
00:21:48,293 --> 00:21:49,434
Sorry, thought these would play right away.

358
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:04,141
And then as you gradually introduce these levels to people

359
00:22:04,141 --> 00:22:06,902
and introduce ways of approaching these challenges,

360
00:22:06,902 --> 00:22:07,902
people get better at it,

361
00:22:07,902 --> 00:22:09,763
and then you can start to do really,

362
00:22:09,763 --> 00:22:10,923
really interesting stuff.

363
00:22:10,923 --> 00:22:14,465
So actually have the snakes collaborate with each other.

364
00:22:14,465 --> 00:22:17,966
So in this one, you have a snake,

365
00:22:17,966 --> 00:22:20,347
two bullet dropping snakes that only the...

366
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:25,988
blue body can get rid of the blue pellets, but the red, but the blue body, sorry, the

367
00:22:25,988 --> 00:22:33,369
blue pellets pop the red body. It's a bit crazy. And then they have this red snake chasing

368
00:22:33,369 --> 00:22:40,830
after the blue snake. And so I think it's actually, someone told me it's easier if I

369
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:44,951
don't explain it. I think it's, I think that's true, actually. And then you can be just kind

370
00:22:44,951 --> 00:22:46,251
of like really mean.

371
00:22:48,192 --> 00:22:48,552
Oh, never mind.

372
00:22:48,552 --> 00:22:50,594
We're not getting, I don't think we have enough time

373
00:22:50,594 --> 00:22:51,915
for that one anyway.

374
00:22:51,915 --> 00:22:55,037
So anyway, this, so defining these challenges

375
00:22:55,037 --> 00:22:57,618
and defining what was actually hard about the game

376
00:22:57,618 --> 00:22:59,940
was kind of a lifesaver for me.

377
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,961
You know, at first I just wanted to make a game

378
00:23:01,961 --> 00:23:03,642
that felt and looked good and, you know,

379
00:23:03,642 --> 00:23:04,723
have some great movement.

380
00:23:04,723 --> 00:23:08,225
But, I mean, that didn't last forever

381
00:23:08,225 --> 00:23:10,486
and I ended up making it more of a traditional action game

382
00:23:10,486 --> 00:23:12,227
than I originally planned.

383
00:23:12,227 --> 00:23:16,110
And so, here's a few things I think that like,

384
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:16,270
by.

385
00:23:17,113 --> 00:23:19,314
putting in hard game how I was able to reshape the game.

386
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:20,915
And here's a few lessons I learned throughout it.

387
00:23:20,915 --> 00:23:24,537
So by specifically define, so specifically define

388
00:23:24,537 --> 00:23:26,358
the challenges your game provides.

389
00:23:26,358 --> 00:23:29,079
So I studied music composition for a long time,

390
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:31,380
well before I got into games.

391
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:35,222
And one of my composition teachers had a really smart idea

392
00:23:35,222 --> 00:23:37,684
about why people get stuck in the middle of a piece.

393
00:23:37,684 --> 00:23:38,704
And what I mean is like, you know,

394
00:23:38,704 --> 00:23:40,565
you're writing a piano piece,

395
00:23:40,565 --> 00:23:42,706
you're two minutes into it, one minute into it,

396
00:23:42,706 --> 00:23:44,107
you get to a part and you're like,

397
00:23:44,107 --> 00:23:45,308
oh, I just don't know what to do next.

398
00:23:45,308 --> 00:23:46,468
And you try something, it doesn't work.

399
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:51,594
And so what people usually do is they keep banging their head against the wall on these last three measures.

400
00:23:51,594 --> 00:23:54,956
And they think, oh, if I just get these last three measures, I can figure it out.

401
00:23:54,956 --> 00:24:00,560
But her idea was like, no, people, they're having this problem because they don't understand what they did in the first minute of the piece.

402
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:04,563
They haven't either, they haven't developed it long enough or they're not taking advantage of that.

403
00:24:04,563 --> 00:24:07,705
But it's not something that is in those three or four measures.

404
00:24:08,463 --> 00:24:12,627
I think this applies to game design too, but maybe in an opposite way.

405
00:24:12,627 --> 00:24:16,830
So if you don't have a clear idea of what your players need to learn or are trying to

406
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,952
learn, then you'll probably get stuck.

407
00:24:18,952 --> 00:24:25,076
So you need to have these kind of like the high skill ceiling, like very, very hard things

408
00:24:25,076 --> 00:24:28,339
to master figured out pretty early in development.

409
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:31,722
I think that does help things get along quite nicely.

410
00:24:33,927 --> 00:24:35,528
For SoftBody, this was a big help.

411
00:24:35,528 --> 00:24:39,790
So develop obstacles that engage with those challenges

412
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:42,411
in the most direct way possible.

413
00:24:42,411 --> 00:24:44,872
So for instance, we don't like it

414
00:24:44,872 --> 00:24:47,133
when the snakes cross streams.

415
00:24:47,133 --> 00:24:49,234
So we're just going to put a big line,

416
00:24:49,234 --> 00:24:51,335
and that's just going to directly force people

417
00:24:51,335 --> 00:24:52,395
to do that sort of thing.

418
00:24:52,395 --> 00:24:54,076
I mean, obviously, you want to have some sort of taste

419
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:55,276
when you put it in there.

420
00:24:55,276 --> 00:24:58,198
You don't want to just like, it's all part of the design,

421
00:24:58,198 --> 00:24:58,618
right?

422
00:24:58,618 --> 00:24:59,838
You want it to be tasteful.

423
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:08,043
But I find that doing this and having it as a clear obstacle that you've planned out will

424
00:25:08,043 --> 00:25:11,705
help you when you need to develop further obstacles, that you can go back to that obstacle

425
00:25:11,705 --> 00:25:15,507
and just kind of be like, okay, can I make a variation on this so it's not so brutal?

426
00:25:15,507 --> 00:25:17,769
Or can I make it faster or can I make it slower?

427
00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:20,870
Does that do anything different for the game and that challenge?

428
00:25:21,986 --> 00:25:25,167
And then finally, difficulty is pretty subjective,

429
00:25:25,167 --> 00:25:28,087
but it's not a huge problem when it's easy for you to adjust.

430
00:25:28,087 --> 00:25:30,168
So if you have a game that's too difficult,

431
00:25:30,168 --> 00:25:33,768
and this really helped me with, like, in the late game

432
00:25:33,768 --> 00:25:35,989
when the difficulty was still a bit high

433
00:25:35,989 --> 00:25:38,989
and I was trying to, like, tune the difficulty curve

434
00:25:38,989 --> 00:25:41,210
so that, you know, players who don't, like,

435
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,570
necessarily love super difficult games

436
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:45,651
would start to get into it.

437
00:25:45,651 --> 00:25:48,151
So if you have this all figured out,

438
00:25:48,151 --> 00:25:49,772
like, as far as what the challenges are,

439
00:25:50,068 --> 00:25:53,650
then it's really easy for you to go in and like, oh, I can just take this turret and

440
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:59,674
it just shoots half as fast. Or, oh, I can like, there's an obstacle that spins around

441
00:25:59,674 --> 00:26:05,077
and it's always killing players. What if I just made it shorter? And it's more useful

442
00:26:05,077 --> 00:26:09,360
for you to have that than just playtesting. I think playtesting is a really good way to

443
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,902
like get a grip of what's going on when people are playing your game.

444
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:17,612
maybe it's a nice warning signal that you've done something too crazy. But getting a handle on it

445
00:26:17,612 --> 00:26:23,394
yourself just in this way is a little bit better. All right. Well, that's all the time I have for

446
00:26:23,394 --> 00:26:26,435
the day. So I just want to say thank you all for coming out.

447
00:26:26,435 --> 00:26:27,376
Thank you.

448
00:26:27,376 --> 00:26:27,756
Thank you.

449
00:26:27,756 --> 00:26:28,056
Thank you.

450
00:26:28,056 --> 00:26:28,316
Thank you.

451
00:26:28,316 --> 00:26:28,776
Thank you.

452
00:26:28,776 --> 00:26:29,276
Thank you.

453
00:26:29,276 --> 00:26:29,637
Thank you.

454
00:26:29,637 --> 00:26:30,277
Thank you.

455
00:26:30,277 --> 00:26:30,857
Thank you.

456
00:26:30,857 --> 00:26:31,597
Thank you.

457
00:26:31,597 --> 00:26:32,858
Thank you.

458
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:33,578
Thank you.
