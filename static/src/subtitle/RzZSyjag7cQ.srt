00:00:06,147 --> 00:00:12,109
My name is Måns, and I'm Director of Monetization and Design at Rovio.

2
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,350
I need to stand close to this.

3
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:18,172
And I have also... Is this too loud?

4
00:00:19,392 --> 00:00:20,313
I have also... Okay.

5
00:00:21,513 --> 00:00:22,674
Hello. My name is Måns.

6
00:00:23,414 --> 00:00:28,296
So, I was for many years the product lead of this game, Angry Birds 2.

7
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:33,418
And I have also been called on our biggest fan forums,

8
00:00:34,178 --> 00:00:35,559
the guy who ruined Angry Birds.

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,623
Now this is a horrible thing to say about anyone.

10
00:00:40,244 --> 00:00:41,585
This is not true.

11
00:00:42,847 --> 00:00:48,052
But I am the guy who had to figure out how to do this, how

12
00:00:48,092 --> 00:00:51,795
to basically turn one of the most popular premium games of

13
00:00:51,835 --> 00:00:53,917
all time and turn it into a free-to-play game.

14
00:00:54,178 --> 00:00:58,542
And things like that tend to piss people off sometimes.

15
00:01:00,323 --> 00:01:04,486
But anyways, Angry Birds 2 is a nice game.

16
00:01:05,387 --> 00:01:08,630
It's our biggest game to date and we really like it.

17
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:13,894
Today I wanted to talk about the mistakes because it's been a bit of a bumpy ride.

18
00:01:13,954 --> 00:01:16,276
So it's been a lot of mistakes during the road.

19
00:01:18,017 --> 00:01:21,560
I had a lot of mistakes. I had 30 once but I had to time it.

20
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,662
Let's go for top 3 mistakes.

21
00:01:25,423 --> 00:01:25,863
Here they are.

22
00:01:26,243 --> 00:01:27,244
Overfeeding the goldfish.

23
00:01:27,957 --> 00:01:31,182
helicopter parenting and all work and no fun.

24
00:01:34,645 --> 00:01:37,788
Mistake number one, overfeeding the goldfish.

25
00:01:37,828 --> 00:01:40,290
This is not really one mistake.

26
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,773
It's more like 1,000 mistakes that all comes from the same

27
00:01:43,934 --> 00:01:45,895
place, which would be me.

28
00:01:47,296 --> 00:01:52,361
So the thing is, if we look at the total revenue of

29
00:01:52,461 --> 00:01:55,744
Angry Birds 2, all the money that we make, and then we

30
00:01:55,784 --> 00:01:58,206
split this money up by spend tier.

31
00:01:59,043 --> 00:02:00,744
how much the players spend in the game.

32
00:02:02,745 --> 00:02:06,626
So then we have the whales, of course, people that spend a lot of money, over more than

33
00:02:06,646 --> 00:02:11,867
a thousand dollars, and they obviously make up for a really big portion of all the money

34
00:02:12,227 --> 00:02:12,988
we get from this game.

35
00:02:13,468 --> 00:02:16,689
And then we have dolphins, people that spend more than five hundred dollars.

36
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:22,231
Seals, this is I'm just making this shit up like that. I haven't been able to find any like

37
00:02:22,931 --> 00:02:24,892
Terminology here, so don't use this

38
00:02:27,033 --> 00:02:30,135
Whales is the only thing that exists as far as I know

39
00:02:31,355 --> 00:02:37,038
The herrings people that spend more than ten dollars in the game, and then we have the goldfish up here

40
00:02:37,078 --> 00:02:42,780
So the goldfish these are people that spend you know less than ten dollars in the game or zero

41
00:02:43,861 --> 00:02:47,903
And me, myself, happen to be a goldfish.

42
00:02:47,943 --> 00:02:50,664
In most games that I play, I spend less than $10,

43
00:02:50,764 --> 00:02:52,485
or I spend nothing.

44
00:02:53,486 --> 00:02:55,307
At least this was the case when I started

45
00:02:55,347 --> 00:02:56,127
working with this game.

46
00:02:56,288 --> 00:02:57,748
I'm more used to this now.

47
00:02:57,808 --> 00:03:00,850
But anyways, I am a goldfish.

48
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:05,653
And this is a bit of a problem, because obviously, you can

49
00:03:05,693 --> 00:03:08,374
see, we don't really make up that big portion of the

50
00:03:08,434 --> 00:03:10,115
revenue, me and my goldfish.

51
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:16,180
mates. So even if there's a lot of us, like a lot, a lot, obviously most people are goldfish.

52
00:03:18,702 --> 00:03:23,847
It's really a problem because if I spend, you know, if I don't watch myself really closely,

53
00:03:23,927 --> 00:03:29,271
I'm going to end up spending 98% of all my time and energy catering for people that make

54
00:03:29,371 --> 00:03:32,934
up for, you know, 2% of the revenue. These are not the guys that...

55
00:03:33,735 --> 00:03:37,417
put food on the table for my kids. So this is a bit of a problem.

56
00:03:37,697 --> 00:03:40,978
I used to be able to use my gut feeling

57
00:03:41,258 --> 00:03:46,741
a lot. I was on TV before I used to write comedy sketches. I love watching comedy

58
00:03:46,761 --> 00:03:47,521
sketches so

59
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:50,823
you know if I write a joke and it makes me giggle

60
00:03:51,683 --> 00:03:55,885
chances are it's probably a pretty good joke and some other people will like it as well.

61
00:03:56,705 --> 00:04:03,132
right? And then I got into gaming. I made this indie cute like indie puzzle games. Also all

62
00:04:03,192 --> 00:04:07,476
about creating something that I like, assuming that other people would like it as well.

63
00:04:08,677 --> 00:04:14,703
And still with, you know, in-game stuff, when I have time to do things like this in

64
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:19,989
Angry Birds 2, for example, still the same. I can use myself, but...

65
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:27,993
when it comes to system design, metagame design, or these kind of games, I am a goldfish. I can't

66
00:04:28,053 --> 00:04:32,435
really use my gut feeling because these are goldfish guts and they are wrong, or at least

67
00:04:32,475 --> 00:04:38,738
they are wrong in the sense that they will not really make the game grow the way that my

68
00:04:39,858 --> 00:04:45,801
bosses wanted to do. So I need to not listen to my guts anymore and that's kind of hard.

69
00:04:46,882 --> 00:04:48,903
So let's talk about phone booth stuffing for a while.

70
00:04:49,443 --> 00:04:51,644
This is not a thing anymore.

71
00:04:52,104 --> 00:04:54,045
I don't think that anyone in here has done this.

72
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,465
But phone booth stuffing was big in the 50s.

73
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,346
People were bored in the 50s.

74
00:04:58,826 --> 00:05:02,628
So this is a thing where you try to cram as many people as

75
00:05:02,668 --> 00:05:04,168
possible into one phone booth.

76
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:08,552
And the world record is 25.

77
00:05:09,192 --> 00:05:15,217
So 25 grown-up people in one phone booth.

78
00:05:15,237 --> 00:05:15,377
Yeah.

79
00:05:15,677 --> 00:05:17,078
They didn't have smartphones and stuff.

80
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:22,442
Anyway, let's take this phone booth, and let's just make

81
00:05:22,482 --> 00:05:23,963
some assumptions here.

82
00:05:24,063 --> 00:05:26,205
Let's assume that these are perfectly

83
00:05:26,385 --> 00:05:28,567
average American males.

84
00:05:29,608 --> 00:05:30,128
In that case.

85
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:37,682
They should be about 181 centimeter tall, and they

86
00:05:37,822 --> 00:05:40,808
should have a net worth of around 33k.

87
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:43,233
This is what Google is telling me, anyways.

88
00:05:44,216 --> 00:05:46,356
Now, we're going to break the world record here today.

89
00:05:46,376 --> 00:05:49,317
We're going to put two more guys into this phone booth.

90
00:05:50,237 --> 00:05:51,277
And not any two guys.

91
00:05:51,297 --> 00:05:54,378
We're going to put these two guys into the phone booth.

92
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:59,239
So this is obviously Jeff Bezos, the most, the richest man alive.

93
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,740
The CEO of Amazon.

94
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:08,421
And it's also Robert Wedlow, who is the tallest man to ever live.

95
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:09,761
So.

96
00:06:11,487 --> 00:06:14,051
Let's put them in there and see.

97
00:06:14,111 --> 00:06:16,154
We now have a new world record, 27.

98
00:06:16,214 --> 00:06:17,216
This is amazing already.

99
00:06:17,897 --> 00:06:20,881
But the averages are not really the same anymore.

100
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:23,565
So we need to update that.

101
00:06:23,605 --> 00:06:25,067
So first, the height.

102
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:26,109
This is actually OK.

103
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,993
It went from 181 centimeter to 184.

104
00:06:30,754 --> 00:06:31,534
We can live with this.

105
00:06:31,634 --> 00:06:35,138
I mean, if I just grab a random dude from this phone booth,

106
00:06:35,678 --> 00:06:38,661
chances are that he's going to be fairly close to 184, right?

107
00:06:39,001 --> 00:06:41,363
Unless, of course, I happen to grab Robert.

108
00:06:41,624 --> 00:06:43,866
But hopefully, fairly close.

109
00:06:43,886 --> 00:06:46,208
So this is an average that tells something, at least.

110
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:50,992
Now, if we look at net worth, it's now $5.2 billion.

111
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:59,687
And this is more problematic because no one in this phone booth has anywhere near 5.2 billion dollars.

112
00:07:00,147 --> 00:07:06,855
One guy has 27 times that and the other guys doesn't have anywhere near that of course.

113
00:07:07,296 --> 00:07:10,419
So this average, I don't really know what to do with it.

114
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,001
If I grab any random guy...

115
00:07:12,964 --> 00:07:17,431
they will never have anywhere close to 5.2 billion dollars.

116
00:07:19,053 --> 00:07:21,817
And this, there are really two takeaways here.

117
00:07:21,897 --> 00:07:24,161
So first off, obviously.

118
00:07:25,966 --> 00:07:31,853
You know, the whales we have in the games, they screw up the data exactly the same way that Jeff Bezos

119
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:38,841
screwed up the nice data we had from this phone booth, and this is quite unintuitive for me as a

120
00:07:38,881 --> 00:07:43,786
goldfish. When I think about an LTV of ten dollars for a game example, like

121
00:07:44,167 --> 00:07:52,954
the average money we make from a player is $10. I tend to think that some people spend $10 but of

122
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:58,678
course no one will. Almost everyone will spend $0 and then some guys will spend a lot more.

123
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:02,681
So this doesn't really come naturally to me as a goldfish.

124
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:15,508
And also, of course, the other takeaway, and actually the more important one, I think, is that money is very unevenly distributed in this world, right?

125
00:08:15,668 --> 00:08:19,610
So whenever I hear these stories, we have these in all games, right?

126
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:22,331
People, whales, super whales, spend more than $100,000 in one game.

127
00:08:26,578 --> 00:08:30,621
That always feels weird or like I always get a bad feeling about that.

128
00:08:30,661 --> 00:08:32,502
Like this guy has a problem, right?

129
00:08:33,043 --> 00:08:35,965
But that's just because $100,000 is a lot of money for me.

130
00:08:36,746 --> 00:08:42,750
If we're talking about Jeff Bezos guy here, $100,000 is nothing for this person, right?

131
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:48,314
I mean, he's probably spending that money when he just goes out to drink champagne with his friends.

132
00:08:49,015 --> 00:08:55,119
So this is very hard for me to remember again as a goldfish.

133
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,022
And I end up, and I have ended up, spending so much time

134
00:08:59,463 --> 00:09:03,005
trying to do this, trying to get people to make that first

135
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:06,768
purchase, trying to make people just spend a little bit more.

136
00:09:07,468 --> 00:09:08,209
And this is really hard.

137
00:09:08,249 --> 00:09:10,270
I mean, for this to make sense, I need people to spend

138
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:14,193
maybe three or four times the money they already spent.

139
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:14,914
That's a lot.

140
00:09:17,215 --> 00:09:22,941
If I work with these guys instead, I only need them to spend 10% more every month or whatever,

141
00:09:23,141 --> 00:09:28,967
and that will actually make a big difference. And also, of course, these are the Jeff Bezos of the

142
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:34,733
gaming world, so they probably have a lot more money. Let them pay for the development of the

143
00:09:34,753 --> 00:09:39,477
game, and then a lot of other people will be able to play really nice games for free.

144
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:45,005
So in that aspect, I am a really, really nice guy, right?

145
00:09:45,966 --> 00:09:50,312
So with that in mind, let's continue.

146
00:09:51,915 --> 00:09:53,597
Mistake number two, I really need a drink, sorry.

147
00:09:58,361 --> 00:10:00,962
Sorry, mistake number two, helicopter parenting.

148
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,083
So this is the start screen of Angry Birds 2

149
00:10:06,103 --> 00:10:08,323
as it looked after launch.

150
00:10:09,724 --> 00:10:13,324
And if you see that little button down in the corner,

151
00:10:13,484 --> 00:10:16,685
this one, I remember hating this button so much.

152
00:10:16,885 --> 00:10:18,826
I bitched so much about this button.

153
00:10:19,326 --> 00:10:20,966
This was the review button.

154
00:10:21,346 --> 00:10:23,167
Okay, so all the games, the review games

155
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:24,987
were supposed to have this button

156
00:10:25,187 --> 00:10:26,807
and it was a button that would take you to,

157
00:10:26,888 --> 00:10:27,388
you know, some.

158
00:10:28,848 --> 00:10:33,232
central stuff like cross promotion to the other games and and Rovio news and

159
00:10:33,252 --> 00:10:36,935
stuff like that and and I just hated this button I wanted to get rid of the

160
00:10:36,975 --> 00:10:44,101
Rovio button because it was you know it was unclean I wanted a clean experience

161
00:10:44,281 --> 00:10:50,005
I was super scared of distracting the players now let's have a look at the

162
00:10:50,105 --> 00:10:51,767
start screen of Angry Birds 2 today

163
00:10:53,568 --> 00:11:01,454
Now you can see that the ruby button is gone, so I did win the war against the corporate overlords.

164
00:11:02,434 --> 00:11:07,958
But we have a lot of other distractions in there, so I counted the buttons today.

165
00:11:07,998 --> 00:11:10,500
We have 25 buttons in the start screen.

166
00:11:11,521 --> 00:11:12,341
So how did this happen?

167
00:11:16,132 --> 00:11:19,634
When we were in pre-production, before we launched the game,

168
00:11:20,935 --> 00:11:22,676
the other games, the other Slingshot games,

169
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,198
had more than 3 billion downloads already.

170
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:28,540
So that's a very, it's a big number, of course.

171
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,062
And obviously, we assumed that since we

172
00:11:32,102 --> 00:11:34,804
have all these downloads, people know how to play these games.

173
00:11:36,045 --> 00:11:37,646
This is easy, casual games.

174
00:11:38,466 --> 00:11:39,147
3 billion, come on.

175
00:11:39,968 --> 00:11:47,468
Right? And then we had the big launch. We launched Angular 2 in the end of July 2015.

176
00:11:49,426 --> 00:11:51,747
And things actually didn't look that way.

177
00:11:51,847 --> 00:11:57,011
So we weren't able to retain the players as well as we

178
00:11:57,071 --> 00:11:57,851
thought we would.

179
00:11:58,192 --> 00:12:01,514
And we also didn't make all the money that we

180
00:12:01,534 --> 00:12:02,254
were supposed to.

181
00:12:02,274 --> 00:12:04,556
So this was a problem.

182
00:12:05,116 --> 00:12:08,499
And we started looking at the data, like what's going on

183
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:09,439
here, what's the problem?

184
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,363
And we made some discoveries.

185
00:12:12,463 --> 00:12:15,406
So first off, people are really bad at throwing birds.

186
00:12:15,766 --> 00:12:18,630
We didn't know that, but they are.

187
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,512
So I mean, do you remember this thing?

188
00:12:20,892 --> 00:12:23,315
When you tap the screen and you do these abilities

189
00:12:23,355 --> 00:12:24,797
with the birds, so this is a blue bird,

190
00:12:24,837 --> 00:12:26,999
we'll split into three and they do this.

191
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,081
They have different abilities.

192
00:12:29,421 --> 00:12:30,221
People don't do that.

193
00:12:30,702 --> 00:12:34,504
And it's very hard. I mean, the game is supposed to be fun and easy and nice.

194
00:12:34,544 --> 00:12:38,766
It's not fun and easy and nice if you don't do these things.

195
00:12:39,786 --> 00:12:40,527
Then it's super hard.

196
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:46,230
So what we realized after launch was that we need to completely turn this game around

197
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,811
and make it into something else.

198
00:12:48,571 --> 00:12:57,796
And the way we thought about it back then was, you know, let's refocus and make this game all about the characters instead, because people seem to like the birds a lot.

199
00:12:59,037 --> 00:13:12,364
And I'm going to spoil this. I mean, this proved to be a very successful strategy. So this is the RPDAO of the game since launch, and it's been going up, I think, like, seven times.

200
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:13,965
Since then.

201
00:13:14,565 --> 00:13:19,788
So the way we did this was basically, you know, we just started adding more depth to

202
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:20,169
the game.

203
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:26,453
We added an arena and daily challenges and hats and you know, just more and more and

204
00:13:26,493 --> 00:13:26,693
more.

205
00:13:26,753 --> 00:13:30,135
So many new features crammed the game with more stuff.

206
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,658
because people didn't seem to get enough.

207
00:13:34,018 --> 00:13:34,999
We added new birds.

208
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:38,862
We even added a little Flappy Bird-inspired jetpack thing

209
00:13:38,962 --> 00:13:42,044
with your little Tamagotchi hatchling some time ago.

210
00:13:42,424 --> 00:13:43,045
Super popular.

211
00:13:43,065 --> 00:13:43,545
People like it.

212
00:13:44,146 --> 00:13:47,709
So the thing is, this all went really well.

213
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:59,271
We should of course have done this earlier. I mean, early on I was super scared. I always thought that, you know, we need to unlock all these features as late as possible.

214
00:13:59,891 --> 00:14:09,633
I was so, so scared of, you know, just distracting these poor players too much and if I gave them too many features, too many options, they're just going to leave.

215
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:11,673
I've seen nothing of that.

216
00:14:12,914 --> 00:14:18,355
So, if we, you know, instead of having this at launch, we would have had this.

217
00:14:19,816 --> 00:14:29,762
We had, we just lost so much by launching a game that, you know, wasn't the game they wanted, wasn't the game they needed.

218
00:14:30,383 --> 00:14:36,206
And this was all because that over-protective helicopter parenting thing.

219
00:14:36,687 --> 00:14:39,208
I didn't think they were ready for something like this, but they really were.

220
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:46,093
Mistake number three, sorry I talk a lot because I'm now getting a bit nervous about time. Are we cool?

221
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:47,921
Okay, good.

222
00:14:49,241 --> 00:14:50,462
All work and no fun.

223
00:14:50,922 --> 00:14:51,662
Mistake number three.

224
00:14:53,222 --> 00:14:56,463
So, do you know what this is? 6.78.

225
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:01,924
This is a D30 retention of Angry Birds 2.

226
00:15:02,024 --> 00:15:02,944
It's not that great.

227
00:15:03,264 --> 00:15:05,445
You really want it to be higher, or I would.

228
00:15:06,145 --> 00:15:11,186
So, obviously when I can't sleep at night, I lie awake in my bed.

229
00:15:11,246 --> 00:15:12,547
This is what I think about.

230
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:16,100
Why, why, why is it 6.78?

231
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,862
Why isn't it 10 or 20?

232
00:15:18,723 --> 00:15:23,126
And I try to figure out what can I do to solve this.

233
00:15:24,187 --> 00:15:27,190
And when I think about things like this, obviously I'm going

234
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,191
to get these kind of ideas.

235
00:15:28,471 --> 00:15:30,713
Like we need a daily log-in calendar.

236
00:15:30,773 --> 00:15:33,455
We need to give them better and better rewards for every

237
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:34,156
day they log in.

238
00:15:34,216 --> 00:15:37,459
And if they log in 30 days in a row, we're going to give

239
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:38,640
them an epic X.

240
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:46,225
Right? Or, you know, we need to create a social clan system so they can chat with their friends

241
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:51,549
and, you know, create new clans and socialize. They don't want to do that on Facebook. They

242
00:15:51,569 --> 00:15:56,512
want to do it here in our game. So, these are the things I'm going to end up thinking about

243
00:15:56,532 --> 00:16:04,357
in my bed. And nothing wrong with these things. These are fine ideas. Will they fix retention?

244
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,460
No, or probably not.

245
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,242
So the problem is that these features, who are they really

246
00:16:13,302 --> 00:16:13,883
catering for?

247
00:16:14,983 --> 00:16:18,025
These features are for the fans, for these guys.

248
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:21,507
If you already like the game, if you already enjoy the game,

249
00:16:22,128 --> 00:16:24,929
these are the kind of features that can give you a context

250
00:16:24,969 --> 00:16:26,130
for enjoying it even more.

251
00:16:27,591 --> 00:16:30,533
But are these guys really the problem?

252
00:16:31,974 --> 00:16:35,297
Look at them, I mean they love the game, they're not going anywhere.

253
00:16:35,797 --> 00:16:41,743
What I need to do is, you know, focus on the people that doesn't like the game and that

254
00:16:41,763 --> 00:16:42,664
choose to leave the game.

255
00:16:43,104 --> 00:16:43,825
It's not these guys.

256
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:49,910
So saying that people like the game, they just want some long term goals, to me it sounds

257
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:53,954
an awful lot like, you know, she's just dating that guy because he has a more expensive car

258
00:16:53,994 --> 00:16:54,334
than I do.

259
00:16:55,055 --> 00:17:01,840
It's what do I want to believe? It's not the truth. It's probably much nicer than I am and also he has a really nice car

260
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:08,785
So they don't want my epic axe because they don't like the game. They know they won't enjoy

261
00:17:08,805 --> 00:17:14,750
Using the epic axe. It's just a game. They just want to kill some time

262
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:18,312
They just want to have some fun here or you know here

263
00:17:19,618 --> 00:17:22,120
Over here, that's what they want.

264
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,123
So it took me a long time to understand this.

265
00:17:26,183 --> 00:17:28,805
The first year after launch, I think

266
00:17:28,825 --> 00:17:32,107
we maybe tested like hundreds of different variations

267
00:17:32,187 --> 00:17:34,549
of the first chapters in the game.

268
00:17:34,829 --> 00:17:36,250
What happens when you enter the game?

269
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,412
How do we keep players in the game?

270
00:17:39,032 --> 00:17:42,435
And every possible variation of difficulty settings

271
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:45,237
of the levels and in which order we give you the chapters,

272
00:17:46,478 --> 00:17:48,059
all these things we tested.

273
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:54,670
And of course, as always, it's quite easy to move the needle on some metrics.

274
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,071
It's very hard to move retention.

275
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,732
Obviously, I mean, we're not selling water in the desert here.

276
00:18:02,132 --> 00:18:04,112
There's a lot of free entertainment around nowadays.

277
00:18:04,172 --> 00:18:08,633
So if they don't like the game, they will leave most of the time.

278
00:18:09,273 --> 00:18:15,555
But one year after launch, I got this email from the people

279
00:18:15,575 --> 00:18:18,395
that make Angerous Pop, another game, a review game.

280
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:24,441
And they told us about how they had this new level design philosophy that made all the levels much more fun,

281
00:18:25,222 --> 00:18:29,667
and how that actually improved their retention a lot.

282
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,871
And of course I was all like, fun? Is that a thing?

283
00:18:33,891 --> 00:18:37,435
Because I've been thinking about all these other solutions for so long.

284
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:41,437
And I all of a sudden, OK, we need to test this, right?

285
00:18:42,297 --> 00:18:45,978
So I told Oscar, lovely guy, this is a level designer,

286
00:18:46,639 --> 00:18:49,140
and I told him, just create a fun group.

287
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,481
Make a test with more fun levels.

288
00:18:51,501 --> 00:18:52,861
So he took the first 30 levels.

289
00:18:53,942 --> 00:18:57,605
Fun is a relative term of course, but just tried to make them more fun.

290
00:18:58,946 --> 00:19:06,693
And for the first time ever, we could actually see clear improvements of the retention.

291
00:19:07,253 --> 00:19:11,197
So all the other tests, hundreds of tests, nothing.

292
00:19:12,358 --> 00:19:14,119
And then we made the game fun.

293
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,342
This is one year after launch, so think about that.

294
00:19:18,562 --> 00:19:22,544
A game like Angry Birds 2, I think we had 50 million downloads the first year.

295
00:19:23,525 --> 00:19:27,627
These 50 million people could have had this more fun, better experience.

296
00:19:28,227 --> 00:19:30,589
That would have made a big difference for us.

297
00:19:31,569 --> 00:19:33,930
It took Oscar two days to create this group.

298
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:40,954
So this might be the biggest, or like, obvious biggest mistake of all, I think.

299
00:19:40,974 --> 00:19:41,014
So...

300
00:19:41,034 --> 00:19:42,795
Go to Beadaholique.com for all of your beading supply needs!

301
00:19:43,276 --> 00:19:52,989
In conclusion, there's nothing wrong with me, you know, thinking about my epic access and trying to cater for the fans of the game, the people that really like it.

302
00:19:53,129 --> 00:19:58,437
It's very good, but I tend to forget that it's just a game.

303
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,931
I started to think there is something else.

304
00:20:02,011 --> 00:20:04,794
It's kind of like when I went here on the plane,

305
00:20:06,476 --> 00:20:09,439
they have this little monitor on the plane.

306
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,141
And there was a QR code.

307
00:20:11,201 --> 00:20:16,487
And it said, scan your phone to personalize your in-flight

308
00:20:16,587 --> 00:20:17,287
experience.

309
00:20:18,428 --> 00:20:24,810
And this is, you know, someone has had a meeting with someone and they've been talking about the in-flight experience.

310
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:31,292
I don't have an in-flight experience. It's just a necessary evil, right? I mean, it's horrible to sit there.

311
00:20:32,992 --> 00:20:40,254
But this is how you start to think about things. I'm no better than these people because I do the same mistake with the games.

312
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:46,055
I think about the player journey or the player experience in the game.

313
00:20:47,676 --> 00:20:53,940
I, um, sorry, this doesn't really work.

314
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,664
So as a conclusion, it's very important, I think, to remember

315
00:21:00,024 --> 00:21:01,024
that it is a game.

316
00:21:01,405 --> 00:21:02,125
It's nothing else.

317
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:03,826
Play the game every day.

318
00:21:03,926 --> 00:21:05,687
For the first year, I kind of didn't.

319
00:21:05,768 --> 00:21:07,269
And then I realized that.

320
00:21:07,329 --> 00:21:09,470
And now I start playing the game every day.

321
00:21:10,671 --> 00:21:14,033
So I have to remind myself, it's just a game.

322
00:21:15,134 --> 00:21:15,554
Make it fun.

323
00:21:17,023 --> 00:21:18,426
And that's it, actually.

324
00:21:18,907 --> 00:21:19,830
That's it, thank you very much.
