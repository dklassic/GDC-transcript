1
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:10,635
So my name is Cole Worley and I'm the staff designer and sort of the de facto head of

2
00:00:10,675 --> 00:00:13,784
development at Leader Games, which is a small game studio.

3
00:00:14,716 --> 00:00:16,557
based in St. Paul, Minnesota.

4
00:00:16,657 --> 00:00:18,719
We have about seven people on staff,

5
00:00:19,499 --> 00:00:22,201
which is sort of like large for a small studio,

6
00:00:22,341 --> 00:00:24,542
but nowhere near what like an actual publisher

7
00:00:24,582 --> 00:00:25,123
would look like.

8
00:00:25,843 --> 00:00:27,624
We all still only work in one room.

9
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:29,966
And over the past couple years,

10
00:00:29,986 --> 00:00:31,427
I have been working for them,

11
00:00:31,527 --> 00:00:33,388
and we have together have made the game Root,

12
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:35,329
which I'll be talking a little bit today.

13
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,431
And then in addition to that,

14
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:39,552
I have a small micro publisher with my brother

15
00:00:39,592 --> 00:00:41,193
where we do sort of weird history games.

16
00:00:42,394 --> 00:00:44,254
I've been thinking about and designing games

17
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:47,055
about conflict, about king-making,

18
00:00:47,555 --> 00:00:50,096
and about how uncomfortable it makes us feel for a while,

19
00:00:50,236 --> 00:00:51,916
and so I'm gonna kind of put those thoughts together.

20
00:00:52,596 --> 00:00:55,177
When I originally sat out to give this talk,

21
00:00:55,217 --> 00:00:57,477
I thought I'd start with something like a Root post-mortem.

22
00:00:58,138 --> 00:00:59,258
You know, this is a GDC talk,

23
00:00:59,318 --> 00:01:01,618
and people seem to like picking apart dead bodies,

24
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:04,359
but Root, it still feels way too early for it.

25
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:06,660
We have a big Kickstarter going on right now,

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,260
there's lots of content coming down the pipe.

27
00:01:09,021 --> 00:01:14,768
And I just don't think I have a vantage point which I could think systematically about what

28
00:01:14,828 --> 00:01:16,790
Root is and what it's done well and not done well.

29
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:19,914
Although if you do have questions about the creation, we can certainly talk about that

30
00:01:20,495 --> 00:01:21,175
in the Q&A.

31
00:01:22,237 --> 00:01:27,263
However, when I was thinking about this talk, as I dug into Root, I was reminded of the

32
00:01:27,323 --> 00:01:28,624
strangeness of the design.

33
00:01:29,681 --> 00:01:32,523
Now, for any of you who've sort of gone through

34
00:01:32,543 --> 00:01:33,944
all the paces with the big project,

35
00:01:33,964 --> 00:01:35,084
you know that by the end of the project,

36
00:01:35,124 --> 00:01:36,965
it seems like the most natural thing in the world.

37
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:39,187
But with a little bit of distance,

38
00:01:39,227 --> 00:01:40,828
you can be reminded of how weird it is.

39
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:44,530
Root is a strange game, and it's done well.

40
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,471
Every year we'll kind of produce like a breakout hit.

41
00:01:47,151 --> 00:01:48,732
I just had never thought that anything

42
00:01:48,772 --> 00:01:49,753
I'd ever work on would do it.

43
00:01:49,813 --> 00:01:52,375
It just wasn't something that we were designing for.

44
00:01:52,755 --> 00:01:55,096
Now, I don't mean to sound ungrateful about any of this.

45
00:01:55,637 --> 00:01:57,578
Root was blessed with a wonderful creative team.

46
00:01:58,314 --> 00:01:59,254
and a great artist.

47
00:01:59,474 --> 00:02:01,195
These are some drawings from Kyle Fair

48
00:02:01,235 --> 00:02:02,455
and I just want to show off his talent

49
00:02:02,515 --> 00:02:03,916
because I get to bother him

50
00:02:03,996 --> 00:02:06,077
and fill out the art request list

51
00:02:06,297 --> 00:02:07,157
and I want to show it off.

52
00:02:08,658 --> 00:02:10,038
The game is cute, it's adorable,

53
00:02:10,178 --> 00:02:14,060
it pulls people in and it has a really nice pitch.

54
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,361
So Root is an asymmetric strategy game.

55
00:02:17,081 --> 00:02:19,822
Now usually when we say an asymmetric strategy game,

56
00:02:20,452 --> 00:02:24,895
people tend to think about it on the order of different powers in a D&D party.

57
00:02:25,355 --> 00:02:30,820
One person's the tank, another person might be healing, someone's a magic user or a thief.

58
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:37,145
Root's really asymmetric, so dramatically asymmetric that the different player positions

59
00:02:37,205 --> 00:02:40,427
are almost operating in different games.

60
00:02:41,368 --> 00:02:46,092
So as an example, the way the pitch goes, if I were encountering you guys at PAX East

61
00:02:46,152 --> 00:02:46,592
or something.

62
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,392
It's basically one player is managing a kingdom.

63
00:02:49,912 --> 00:02:52,194
She starts the game with full control of the board,

64
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,836
a warrior in nearly every clearing.

65
00:02:53,856 --> 00:02:55,437
There are buildings all over the place.

66
00:02:55,457 --> 00:02:57,299
She's freshly conquered the woodland.

67
00:02:57,859 --> 00:02:59,420
And all she needs to do is keep the peace.

68
00:03:00,361 --> 00:03:02,163
And she's keeping the peace so that she can move

69
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:05,205
her resources around and build her kingdom up.

70
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,091
And during that process, a rebellion might break out,

71
00:03:09,211 --> 00:03:11,773
and she might have to deal with sympathy for the insurgents.

72
00:03:12,573 --> 00:03:13,754
In order to put down the rebellion,

73
00:03:13,814 --> 00:03:17,016
she might find help from a wandering mercenary.

74
00:03:17,476 --> 00:03:19,457
But if the mercenary in putting down the rebellion

75
00:03:19,477 --> 00:03:20,918
becomes more popular than she is,

76
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,419
then maybe she'll have to exile that mercenary.

77
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,680
There's no script to this.

78
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,841
All of these interactions happen organically.

79
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:31,383
And rather than these different events

80
00:03:31,403 --> 00:03:34,025
sort of being dictated by a draw of an event card,

81
00:03:34,945 --> 00:03:37,887
Each one of these different positions is essentially a different player.

82
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:44,451
One player plays, you know, essentially an adventure game working within the larger game.

83
00:03:44,551 --> 00:03:48,013
The player who's playing the rebellion is having to be really, is essentially playing

84
00:03:48,053 --> 00:03:53,356
a political game underneath the economic game that the Marquis de Cat is playing.

85
00:03:54,043 --> 00:03:55,965
Now usually around this time, if I'm at a convention,

86
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,346
I'll turn around the box and they'll see

87
00:03:57,386 --> 00:03:58,507
these really cute meeples.

88
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,628
And the thing is more or less sold on the spot

89
00:04:00,728 --> 00:04:02,209
because look at that meeple.

90
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,452
But before I ring them up on the register,

91
00:04:06,772 --> 00:04:09,814
I have to be as straight as possible with them.

92
00:04:10,955 --> 00:04:13,116
Root is not a game for everybody.

93
00:04:14,137 --> 00:04:16,499
Usually the test I give to prospective buyers

94
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,479
looks something like this.

95
00:04:19,111 --> 00:04:21,172
Are you okay with the fact that one of your friends

96
00:04:21,232 --> 00:04:22,613
is going to put pieces on the board,

97
00:04:23,053 --> 00:04:23,994
and then another one of your friends

98
00:04:24,054 --> 00:04:25,435
is going to remove those pieces,

99
00:04:26,215 --> 00:04:27,556
and they might laugh at you when they do it.

100
00:04:27,936 --> 00:04:29,277
And if you can pass that test,

101
00:04:29,537 --> 00:04:31,258
you're probably a good candidate to buying it.

102
00:04:32,218 --> 00:04:33,139
There's just no getting around it.

103
00:04:33,299 --> 00:04:34,479
The game is very, very mean.

104
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,122
And it's mean in a way that is a little out of step

105
00:04:39,402 --> 00:04:42,403
with not only the kinds of games

106
00:04:42,543 --> 00:04:44,704
that sell to a broad audience in the hobby market,

107
00:04:45,045 --> 00:04:47,066
but also a more general design ethos.

108
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:51,761
Now, it's mean, I think when we talk about the meanness,

109
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:53,382
I should be specific what I'm talking about.

110
00:04:53,562 --> 00:04:54,703
There are no catch-up mechanisms.

111
00:04:55,364 --> 00:04:57,265
There's a lot of direct player interaction.

112
00:04:57,805 --> 00:04:58,846
Some of it is zero-sum.

113
00:04:59,326 --> 00:05:00,867
I'm gonna take something and you can't have it.

114
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:05,390
It's also got a really, really high variance.

115
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,812
Depending on the faction mixes, the play styles,

116
00:05:09,172 --> 00:05:11,973
all of the things around the actual playing of the game,

117
00:05:12,594 --> 00:05:14,995
a round of Root can look very, very, very different.

118
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,506
and I don't want to hide that from the players.

119
00:05:19,306 --> 00:05:22,167
Now, usually these sorts of elements

120
00:05:22,207 --> 00:05:24,088
are kind of regarded as a little bit old-fashioned,

121
00:05:24,188 --> 00:05:26,289
and they get polished out in the development process.

122
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:29,189
I've been fortunate to be on the development teams

123
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:31,730
for many games, and I know that when a game

124
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:36,672
goes from design to development, the questions shift, right?

125
00:05:36,772 --> 00:05:37,872
When you're designing a game,

126
00:05:37,952 --> 00:05:39,253
you're trying to make an impression.

127
00:05:39,877 --> 00:05:42,158
You're trying to capture the imagination

128
00:05:42,178 --> 00:05:43,359
of your prospective publisher.

129
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:45,239
But when you're developing a game,

130
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:46,740
you're trying to make sure that you're not

131
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,860
gonna make your players mad.

132
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:49,221
Right?

133
00:05:49,281 --> 00:05:51,822
I mean, it's a wholly different set of skills.

134
00:05:52,142 --> 00:05:53,223
You don't wanna make your players mad.

135
00:05:53,243 --> 00:05:54,823
You want them to come back, to like it.

136
00:05:55,403 --> 00:05:57,784
You don't want hate mail on BGG

137
00:05:57,864 --> 00:05:59,185
or really angry Reddit threads.

138
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,784
So when Root started moving from design to development,

139
00:06:04,824 --> 00:06:06,265
I was a little worried because of the things

140
00:06:06,285 --> 00:06:07,765
that I really liked about the game

141
00:06:07,805 --> 00:06:08,906
were the things that I knew

142
00:06:09,566 --> 00:06:11,667
were going to be totally destroyed in development.

143
00:06:12,327 --> 00:06:14,989
Thankfully, Patrick Leder, our owner and creative director,

144
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:17,670
had the temerity to also let me be on the development team,

145
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,151
and which is an awful decision.

146
00:06:20,892 --> 00:06:22,853
You should never allow a designer to work on development.

147
00:06:23,113 --> 00:06:24,053
I really love development,

148
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,754
and I love the process of cutting something apart

149
00:06:26,794 --> 00:06:28,115
that I've spent a year building.

150
00:06:29,286 --> 00:06:32,228
But I worked really hard to make sure that even as we made

151
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:35,109
the game more elegant and as we sort of cut it up nicely,

152
00:06:35,489 --> 00:06:38,010
that the weird parts were the parts that stayed.

153
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,191
So, today I want to talk a little bit about

154
00:06:41,432 --> 00:06:44,393
the sharp edges of root, the meanness of the game.

155
00:06:45,553 --> 00:06:50,556
And I want to do this not by talking about root,

156
00:06:50,616 --> 00:06:53,417
but instead by talking about why we think of those things

157
00:06:53,477 --> 00:06:55,058
as sharp edges in the first place,

158
00:06:55,338 --> 00:06:58,359
and what we might be losing when we don't explore them.

159
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:04,883
And so in order to sort of launch this exploration, I think we have to think about a sort of central term,

160
00:07:04,923 --> 00:07:07,385
and that term for me is kingmaking.

161
00:07:08,005 --> 00:07:10,507
Because ultimately, Root is a game about kingmaking.

162
00:07:10,527 --> 00:07:13,509
I always have a good laugh when I see a thread and someone's like,

163
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:16,310
oh man, Root, I heard that it has a kingmaking problem.

164
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,192
And I'm like, it doesn't have a kingmaking problem, it is the kingmaking problem.

165
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:21,639
And it's a political game.

166
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:23,340
I mean, if you're making a political game,

167
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,861
it makes sense that you're dealing with concepts

168
00:07:25,881 --> 00:07:27,181
like power brokers, right?

169
00:07:28,062 --> 00:07:30,543
But the fact that we oftentimes get friction there

170
00:07:30,703 --> 00:07:33,084
from people wanting to buy the game or from critics,

171
00:07:33,524 --> 00:07:38,006
I think suggests that we are currently in a tabletop era

172
00:07:38,406 --> 00:07:41,067
that is really locked into a certain kind of design ethos.

173
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:45,821
So we're going to start by talking a little bit about kingmaking and I'm going to try to trace

174
00:07:45,901 --> 00:07:51,544
why I think it's fallen out of fashion and then I want to marshal a sort of like simple defense

175
00:07:51,584 --> 00:07:56,327
for kingmaking and then talk about some practical lessons for those would-be practitioners out there.

176
00:07:57,134 --> 00:07:57,975
So, king making.

177
00:07:58,255 --> 00:08:00,217
The act of making someone king, it's pretty simple.

178
00:08:00,497 --> 00:08:02,638
The term is actually a little bit more interesting than that.

179
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:05,120
It starts with this guy, there he is,

180
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,661
Richard Neville, Earl Warwick.

181
00:08:06,922 --> 00:08:08,983
By the way, you're gonna get a lot of stupid,

182
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,805
no animation PowerPoints from me with old pictures

183
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:13,847
because I come from an academic background

184
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:15,268
and that's how we do our PowerPoints.

185
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:21,294
So this guy Richard Neville, the Earl of Warwick, Warwick the Kingmaker he was called during the War of the Roses,

186
00:08:22,275 --> 00:08:26,940
that title was used almost entirely derisively because he was, you know,

187
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:33,307
back, you know, we're back in the era of the divine right of kings. If you have someone, a human, deciding who to become king,

188
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:35,750
that's an awful heretical idea.

189
00:08:36,962 --> 00:08:40,624
And so it falls out of fashion pretty quickly, although, and just a little note,

190
00:08:40,844 --> 00:08:43,605
so the game on the right is Avalon Hill's famous game Kingmaker,

191
00:08:44,546 --> 00:08:47,107
which I always thought was named after, like, the kingmaking problem,

192
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:50,748
but it's actually, no, it's about Mr. Earl of Warwick over there.

193
00:08:51,969 --> 00:08:55,731
Now, an interesting thing happens in the 18th century, so a few hundred years after that,

194
00:08:56,351 --> 00:08:57,651
the historian David Hume...

195
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,457
You didn't think I was going to go there, but here we are in the 18th century.

196
00:09:01,877 --> 00:09:04,638
He starts using the word kingmaker in a very positive way.

197
00:09:04,658 --> 00:09:10,801
He loves Richard Neville because for him, to be master of your age was to be in a position

198
00:09:10,901 --> 00:09:12,842
where you got to determine the course of history.

199
00:09:13,322 --> 00:09:16,524
And so the kingmakers are the real heroes, not the kings.

200
00:09:16,544 --> 00:09:17,864
So

201
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,104
Here a slight bit of disclosure is needed.

202
00:09:23,464 --> 00:09:26,147
I love games when I get to make the king,

203
00:09:26,388 --> 00:09:27,449
even if I don't get to be the king.

204
00:09:27,969 --> 00:09:31,233
And oftentimes I even enjoy the experience

205
00:09:31,694 --> 00:09:32,995
when it fires against me.

206
00:09:33,396 --> 00:09:35,558
When I was sort of looking for pictures

207
00:09:35,698 --> 00:09:37,581
deep, deep, deep inside of Board Game Geek,

208
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:38,682
I stumbled into this one.

209
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,500
Circa 2006 in the Twilight Imperium.

210
00:09:42,941 --> 00:09:44,743
It's in the Twilight Imperium image gallery, guys.

211
00:09:45,383 --> 00:09:48,906
And this is a rare shot of me playing a game of Twilight

212
00:09:48,926 --> 00:09:51,948
Imperium at the moment someone has stolen the victory for me

213
00:09:51,988 --> 00:09:53,530
by passing an idiotic law.

214
00:09:55,331 --> 00:09:56,092
And I just.

215
00:09:57,067 --> 00:09:58,067
There's hatred in those eyes.

216
00:09:58,128 --> 00:10:00,990
But also, that's a game that stuck in my mind.

217
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,131
When I stumbled on this picture,

218
00:10:02,151 --> 00:10:03,371
which I had completely forgotten about,

219
00:10:04,052 --> 00:10:06,354
I remembered so many things about that game,

220
00:10:06,394 --> 00:10:07,675
including the fact that we were playing

221
00:10:08,295 --> 00:10:10,797
in a weird, like, attic-y space,

222
00:10:10,857 --> 00:10:12,638
and we only had three hours to play.

223
00:10:12,658 --> 00:10:14,480
So we played a game of Twilight Imperium in three hours,

224
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,681
if you can possibly believe it.

225
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:17,542
So.

226
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:25,260
Even talking about kingmaking and thinking about the idea that it might be desirable

227
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,482
for you to steal a victory from your friend and to be mean to each other, it provokes

228
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:34,344
even me, a fan of the genre, it provokes a really physical response.

229
00:10:34,744 --> 00:10:36,405
My stomach turns a little and I cringe.

230
00:10:37,826 --> 00:10:41,887
This is strange because we all have opinions about games.

231
00:10:41,927 --> 00:10:45,669
You might like party games or you might like games about Panzer tanks in World War II.

232
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,661
But your distaste for panzer takes doesn't lead you

233
00:10:49,741 --> 00:10:50,961
to have your stomach turn.

234
00:10:51,621 --> 00:10:52,682
King-making, on the other hand,

235
00:10:52,802 --> 00:10:54,562
is attacking something really basic.

236
00:10:54,742 --> 00:10:58,344
And as someone who plays games and designs them

237
00:10:58,384 --> 00:11:00,744
and also tries to really earnestly study them,

238
00:11:01,265 --> 00:11:03,065
that physical response is interesting

239
00:11:03,305 --> 00:11:06,826
because it seems different from other ways of,

240
00:11:08,007 --> 00:11:10,608
other preferences that we express about our games.

241
00:11:12,508 --> 00:11:12,668
So.

242
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,202
Why do we dislike kingmaking so much?

243
00:11:16,262 --> 00:11:17,662
Where does this dislike come from?

244
00:11:18,023 --> 00:11:18,903
Was it always with us?

245
00:11:19,043 --> 00:11:21,004
Is this sort of a new invention?

246
00:11:21,124 --> 00:11:24,086
I sort of want to start here with this really, really broad

247
00:11:24,686 --> 00:11:25,627
historical frame.

248
00:11:25,707 --> 00:11:29,649
Because I think one thing that happens when we talk about

249
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,530
games is we think about them as very new.

250
00:11:32,355 --> 00:11:34,715
And we like to think about, oh, you remember back

251
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:35,796
when Catan came out?

252
00:11:35,836 --> 00:11:39,737
That was like the ancient age of board games, which is, of course,

253
00:11:39,817 --> 00:11:40,297
not true.

254
00:11:40,397 --> 00:11:43,758
But because the modern iteration of this art form

255
00:11:43,798 --> 00:11:46,778
is only 30 years old, we like to extend our timeline.

256
00:11:46,798 --> 00:11:48,699
And we think in gold ages and silver ages.

257
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:50,539
And we're really talking about just a couple decades.

258
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:51,880
So.

259
00:11:52,597 --> 00:11:56,382
I think this is a very, very unremarkable thesis, but it's needed here.

260
00:11:57,042 --> 00:11:59,705
We don't like kingmaking because we like fairness.

261
00:12:00,026 --> 00:12:05,252
Fairness is really, really critically important to how we think about games, what we want

262
00:12:05,272 --> 00:12:06,533
them to do, and all the rest.

263
00:12:08,022 --> 00:12:10,324
We generally view our games as a contest

264
00:12:10,584 --> 00:12:11,645
of skills and experience.

265
00:12:12,385 --> 00:12:14,627
And we have this idea in the back of our minds

266
00:12:14,727 --> 00:12:17,168
that it's gonna be fairly decided, that's important.

267
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:21,551
And this leads us to sort of weird mental leaps of logic

268
00:12:21,712 --> 00:12:23,613
that aren't always necessary.

269
00:12:23,673 --> 00:12:27,115
So for instance, when you sit down and play Catan,

270
00:12:27,876 --> 00:12:29,897
you might roll very well in the first half of the game

271
00:12:29,997 --> 00:12:33,139
and everybody else thinks, well, I've built my cities

272
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,600
on all of those sixes and eights

273
00:12:34,781 --> 00:12:36,101
and it'll be my day soon.

274
00:12:37,012 --> 00:12:40,955
And even the person who's experiencing the good luck knows that maybe their luck is going to fall off.

275
00:12:41,255 --> 00:12:42,176
Now that's nonsense.

276
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:46,018
You know, it's possible an eight is never rolled in an entire game of Catan.

277
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:50,101
But even if you play something as capricious as Yahtzee,

278
00:12:50,502 --> 00:12:54,724
there's a general sense that we are all experiencing the same kind of luck,

279
00:12:54,845 --> 00:12:57,566
and we all need to make the most out of what is gold to us.

280
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,282
Now this is a totally new and crazy way of thinking.

281
00:13:03,762 --> 00:13:08,704
I think that we live in an age that is really preoccupied by fairness, or at least the appearance

282
00:13:08,764 --> 00:13:09,245
of fairness.

283
00:13:09,805 --> 00:13:12,646
As anyone knows, the world is not a very fair place at all.

284
00:13:13,211 --> 00:13:16,734
And this was a little more obvious when you go backwards. Consider for instance

285
00:13:17,894 --> 00:13:20,596
Trojan War. See, I told you guys, I warned you.

286
00:13:21,357 --> 00:13:27,161
Fairness is pretty new. I mean think about the Trojan War, right? Won by a tricky person doing a tricky trick and how dirty of

287
00:13:27,201 --> 00:13:29,923
him to sneak a bunch of people in within a fake horse.

288
00:13:30,903 --> 00:13:37,027
And in fact, Odysseus as a hero is prized for his guile. He's a trickster hero, and we love him for it.

289
00:13:37,428 --> 00:13:39,329
There's nothing fair about the whole thing.

290
00:13:41,732 --> 00:13:44,553
This can be broadly extended to a lot of the ways

291
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:46,474
that people have written and thought about games

292
00:13:46,794 --> 00:13:48,915
since the inception of games themselves.

293
00:13:48,935 --> 00:13:52,737
Some of the first records of games of chess being played

294
00:13:53,477 --> 00:13:55,218
were games where cheating took place,

295
00:13:55,718 --> 00:13:57,159
and then people were often killed afterwards,

296
00:13:57,179 --> 00:13:59,159
which is why they bothered to write it in the first place.

297
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,261
If you, I mean, you can stumble upon that.

298
00:14:02,281 --> 00:14:04,562
If you just search like history of chess and cheating,

299
00:14:04,682 --> 00:14:07,823
like, it is incredible the number of people who have died

300
00:14:08,003 --> 00:14:08,843
because they slid their.

301
00:14:10,704 --> 00:14:13,287
They just happened to find a way to put their queen on the board in the late game.

302
00:14:14,068 --> 00:14:18,952
There's a famous anecdote about Napoleon being awful at chess, but the other anecdote about

303
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:23,597
Napoleon in chess is that usually at the end of his game, the person who's playing this

304
00:14:23,617 --> 00:14:25,999
would notice that both of the bishops were on the same color.

305
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:32,085
But by that point, Napoleon had whisked away and was doing some real conquering.

306
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:35,371
And it was actually, I won't get into all this stuff

307
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:36,292
because I could go on all day.

308
00:14:37,473 --> 00:14:40,056
There was a sense that even cheating was part of the game

309
00:14:40,396 --> 00:14:42,098
and what you could get away with at the table,

310
00:14:42,378 --> 00:14:43,799
I mean it was all part of it.

311
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:46,101
I mean really Bridge, for those of you who have

312
00:14:46,301 --> 00:14:48,543
taken any look at Bridge, so much of that game is

313
00:14:48,704 --> 00:14:51,306
what is the cool informal communication system

314
00:14:51,346 --> 00:14:53,448
that we can arrive at without anybody realizing

315
00:14:53,468 --> 00:14:55,310
that we're sort of breaking the rules of Bridge

316
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,131
without really breaking the rules of Bridge.

317
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:03,573
Teaching at the University of Texas, we often used this story called

318
00:15:03,593 --> 00:15:05,874
The Queen of Spades by a guy named Alexander Pushkin.

319
00:15:06,654 --> 00:15:09,915
And it's an interesting story in the context of this talk,

320
00:15:10,015 --> 00:15:14,556
because basically it's about a game, a game of pharaoh, a gambling game.

321
00:15:14,856 --> 00:15:17,797
And the main character, his name's Herman, he's an engineer, and

322
00:15:17,837 --> 00:15:18,537
he hates games.

323
00:15:18,597 --> 00:15:21,438
He hates how capricious, how seemingly unfair they are.

324
00:15:22,098 --> 00:15:24,659
And then he discovers that there might be a trick to pharaoh,

325
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:26,880
a secret strategy which will lead him to always win.

326
00:15:27,674 --> 00:15:32,377
And like so many addled users of BGG, he hunts the forums and he figures out exactly what

327
00:15:32,437 --> 00:15:34,459
the critical trick is to win at Pharaoh.

328
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:35,680
And he figures it out.

329
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,441
And he cheats a bunch of people out of their money.

330
00:15:38,462 --> 00:15:40,144
How unfair for the people he played against.

331
00:15:40,584 --> 00:15:44,747
And then in typical Russian narrative logic, he loses all his money and goes insane.

332
00:15:45,228 --> 00:15:48,931
So unfair for the people he cheated, unfair for himself, unfair for everybody.

333
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:50,439
That's games.

334
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:53,740
Now, it may seem a little trite to just be talking

335
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,900
about literature in this way.

336
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,601
Like, obviously, I'm drifting a little bit

337
00:15:56,701 --> 00:15:58,601
from the stakes of games.

338
00:15:58,681 --> 00:16:00,762
But I want to just make sure that we all realize

339
00:16:00,802 --> 00:16:03,923
that this ethos of unfairness, this

340
00:16:04,483 --> 00:16:06,924
extended to many different spheres of life.

341
00:16:07,324 --> 00:16:09,345
One quick example I'll give everyone

342
00:16:10,765 --> 00:16:13,546
is the trial by ordeal and by combat.

343
00:16:13,986 --> 00:16:16,007
So this is a sort of.

344
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,971
judicial test, a bit of jurisprudence,

345
00:16:19,451 --> 00:16:23,013
where basically if you don't know whether or not someone is telling the truth,

346
00:16:23,073 --> 00:16:25,994
you just start lighting them on fire, or you dump them in the water,

347
00:16:26,435 --> 00:16:27,815
and if they're telling the truth, God will save them.

348
00:16:28,675 --> 00:16:29,496
And if they're not, then

349
00:16:30,576 --> 00:16:31,477
obviously they were wrong.

350
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:34,578
Now, that seems insane to us.

351
00:16:36,826 --> 00:16:39,367
The critical thing is that fairness wasn't important.

352
00:16:39,547 --> 00:16:42,868
It was this capital T truth that was looming behind things.

353
00:16:42,908 --> 00:16:45,388
And the capital T truth could be paradoxical

354
00:16:45,488 --> 00:16:47,249
and could be rotten and all of those things.

355
00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:50,570
Now in Germany, the fabled land of board games,

356
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,711
in ancient Germany, they sort of spun this

357
00:16:53,811 --> 00:16:56,112
into a tradition known as trial by combat.

358
00:16:57,228 --> 00:17:02,452
And what's interesting about even trial by combat is you don't practice it or you're not supposed to.

359
00:17:03,052 --> 00:17:06,895
It's not about like the bigger guy is always going to win in a trial of combat. It's the person who's right.

360
00:17:07,836 --> 00:17:13,060
They get to win. So this is always, you know, the thing about might versus right that sometimes gets forgotten is

361
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:13,820
in

362
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:18,240
so many sort of dogmatic logics,

363
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:23,102
might is given to the people who are right. It's not like I'm strong so I'm

364
00:17:23,122 --> 00:17:25,503
going to pin you down to the ground and make you do whatever you'd like,

365
00:17:25,803 --> 00:17:29,024
whatever I'd like you to do, which is a very like modern way of reviewing it. It's

366
00:17:29,044 --> 00:17:29,645
like no,

367
00:17:30,285 --> 00:17:34,547
God has appointed certain people to be strong and then they also carry a kind

368
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:35,427
of rightness with them.

369
00:17:35,987 --> 00:17:39,388
And the more modern like spinning of dueling and honor all that, it kind of

370
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:40,649
flies out from this. Now...

371
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:48,104
I'm going to stop here sort of with the historical stuff to just step back and say that, okay,

372
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:53,649
so right now, if you think about the modern design ethos, how we think about games and

373
00:17:53,689 --> 00:17:57,733
what makes a good game and a bad game, fairness is very important.

374
00:17:58,053 --> 00:18:01,536
And here we have one man shooting another man probably over something really stupid,

375
00:18:02,237 --> 00:18:04,919
although not in this case because it's Hamilton and Burke.

376
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,951
So how do we get to fairness?

377
00:18:09,071 --> 00:18:09,691
Where does it come from?

378
00:18:09,831 --> 00:18:11,691
Now I'm not going to give you guys a full chronology

379
00:18:11,711 --> 00:18:14,492
of fairness because we've got more interesting things

380
00:18:14,652 --> 00:18:18,352
to talk about, but there is a very easy short history of it,

381
00:18:18,392 --> 00:18:20,973
which is to say we can talk about Victorian morality.

382
00:18:21,473 --> 00:18:23,193
Now board games, this is the origin of board games

383
00:18:23,574 --> 00:18:24,874
in the modern sense.

384
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:28,514
So board games come about in the 19th century

385
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,615
and they're the result of basically three things.

386
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,495
One, printing got really cheap.

387
00:18:33,492 --> 00:18:36,913
You get steam presses, it's easy to manufacture,

388
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:39,573
you've got a factory system that can glue things

389
00:18:39,613 --> 00:18:41,034
onto pasteboards, so they get very cheap.

390
00:18:41,674 --> 00:18:44,415
More people know how to read, which you need

391
00:18:44,695 --> 00:18:45,935
for a lot of these early board games.

392
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:48,976
And the last thing is you have a sense of,

393
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,897
a utilitarian sense that maybe we should be

394
00:18:51,937 --> 00:18:52,977
teaching people things.

395
00:18:53,637 --> 00:18:56,278
So this is a very early board game from 1843

396
00:18:56,338 --> 00:18:59,119
called The Mansion of Happiness by a guy named George Fox.

397
00:18:59,499 --> 00:19:02,780
And like most Victorian board games, it's a roll and move.

398
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:03,770
How fun.

399
00:19:05,513 --> 00:19:08,498
You basically make no decisions and you land on spaces

400
00:19:08,758 --> 00:19:10,921
and then you either get to go further

401
00:19:11,522 --> 00:19:13,525
if you landed on a space where you did something good

402
00:19:13,645 --> 00:19:15,588
or you go backwards if you did something naughty.

403
00:19:16,404 --> 00:19:19,947
And the reward of the game is you get into heaven, which is also nice.

404
00:19:21,448 --> 00:19:26,352
Now what is really wild here is like life is still in circulation, guys.

405
00:19:26,672 --> 00:19:29,475
We have not moved past this point really at all.

406
00:19:29,695 --> 00:19:31,476
We just have a more colorful spinner.

407
00:19:32,537 --> 00:19:38,822
And in 1886, this is one of many, I love this, the game of the district messenger boy or

408
00:19:39,683 --> 00:19:40,483
merit rewarded.

409
00:19:41,122 --> 00:19:46,585
Now, what is interesting about this second game is that it's not couched in spiritual

410
00:19:46,605 --> 00:19:46,945
terms.

411
00:19:47,025 --> 00:19:52,148
Basically, in spiritual terms, basically if you do things that are good and nice, then

412
00:19:52,188 --> 00:19:55,590
you get money in the game and you get more and more money and then eventually you're

413
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:56,250
Andrew Carnegie.

414
00:19:57,811 --> 00:20:01,393
Now some of you might be noticing a weird disconnect here.

415
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:06,996
So here's a game that is maybe teaching you about the dangers of gambling, but you're

416
00:20:07,076 --> 00:20:08,377
rolling a die.

417
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,910
So like I roll the die and I landed on, oh dang, bet all my money in cards, go back.

418
00:20:14,311 --> 00:20:17,839
And then someone else rolls the die and they say, you gave up gambling, advance.

419
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,603
But we both rolled a die.

420
00:20:21,302 --> 00:20:24,543
So there's a weird mechanical and thematic friction

421
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:25,323
happening here.

422
00:20:26,383 --> 00:20:28,824
And I think a lot of our current design ethos

423
00:20:28,924 --> 00:20:32,285
comes out of a desire to fix this problem.

424
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:35,746
So we arrive then at the fun and fair design ethos.

425
00:20:36,206 --> 00:20:38,807
Games should delight, and they should instruct.

426
00:20:39,267 --> 00:20:42,988
So we want, like those happy, happy Victorian children,

427
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:44,829
we want to learn in our games,

428
00:20:44,889 --> 00:20:46,509
we want to be enriched by them,

429
00:20:46,569 --> 00:20:47,890
and we want to be delighted by them.

430
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:49,230
But.

431
00:20:50,293 --> 00:20:52,934
In order to make the games coherent,

432
00:20:54,895 --> 00:20:58,176
you need to make it so that skill and experience

433
00:20:58,236 --> 00:20:59,257
are rewarded by victory.

434
00:21:00,457 --> 00:21:03,138
And I think basically everything about how we practice

435
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,500
design sort of comes out of this tension, right?

436
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,141
We want our games to be fair,

437
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:10,722
because if they're not fair,

438
00:21:10,942 --> 00:21:14,063
then we're not teaching the lesson that we want to teach.

439
00:21:14,744 --> 00:21:18,605
But if you have a game be charged with something like,

440
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:22,831
morality, right? If you win the game, you are the most economical, you are the most

441
00:21:22,892 --> 00:21:28,713
virtuous. Then what the game is also doing is, sort of like in Calvinist fashion, separating

442
00:21:28,853 --> 00:21:34,135
out the damned from the saved, the winners from the losers, and anybody who's ever lost

443
00:21:34,195 --> 00:21:37,336
a friend or a family member over a game of Monopoly realizes that there's like a real

444
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:38,757
charge to this, right?

445
00:21:41,694 --> 00:21:44,997
So remember how at the beginning, when I was talking about kingmaking, I was feeling a

446
00:21:45,017 --> 00:21:45,597
little queasy?

447
00:21:46,057 --> 00:21:51,221
Looking at these Victorian children also makes me feel queasy, because I feel like fairness

448
00:21:51,281 --> 00:21:56,265
itself is a little storied, and when you start thinking about it, when you start thinking

449
00:21:56,305 --> 00:22:01,990
about the cool games that we're making as part of an ideological program, it makes the

450
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:02,890
games a lot less cool.

451
00:22:03,702 --> 00:22:05,743
So it actually gets a lot worse.

452
00:22:06,363 --> 00:22:08,424
When I was a graduate student, I stumbled into this book,

453
00:22:09,305 --> 00:22:11,006
James Magnin's, or J.A. Magnin's,

454
00:22:11,266 --> 00:22:12,606
The Game Ethic and Imperialism.

455
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,087
I apologize for that just awful type of a title.

456
00:22:15,548 --> 00:22:17,008
I literally stumbled into this book.

457
00:22:17,108 --> 00:22:18,869
It was in a free stack in a box,

458
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:19,970
and I just tripped over it

459
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,030
as I was walking down the hallway.

460
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:24,291
And at the time, I was working on a game about Afghanistan

461
00:22:24,492 --> 00:22:25,612
and thinking a lot about

462
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:28,173
sort of turn of the century game design.

463
00:22:28,934 --> 00:22:31,118
And so I just put the book in my bag and thought, cool,

464
00:22:31,499 --> 00:22:33,923
I'm going to learn about H.G. Wells' war games.

465
00:22:34,699 --> 00:22:37,721
and maybe something about empire and something like that.

466
00:22:38,221 --> 00:22:40,543
And it was, you know, like any book that you acquire,

467
00:22:40,563 --> 00:22:42,204
it takes like a year to actually open it up.

468
00:22:42,324 --> 00:22:44,045
And when I did open it up, I found that it was actually

469
00:22:44,065 --> 00:22:47,067
about something quite different, which is the games ethic.

470
00:22:47,107 --> 00:22:49,889
And I think this is a really useful and powerful idea.

471
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:53,412
So the basic argument that Magnin makes is this.

472
00:22:53,852 --> 00:22:57,695
Sports, games in general, as a competitive

473
00:22:57,755 --> 00:22:59,556
and serious hobby, they emerge

474
00:22:59,596 --> 00:23:02,278
in the 19th century public school system in Britain.

475
00:23:02,947 --> 00:23:08,070
Now the public school system means something in the British context that's different from

476
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,231
the United States context.

477
00:23:09,691 --> 00:23:13,354
So in the U.S. when we talk about public schools, we just mean state-controlled schools.

478
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:19,517
In the British context, a public school is about the management of empire and the management

479
00:23:19,577 --> 00:23:23,940
of the broader sort of governmental and bureaucratic apparatus of the state.

480
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:30,004
So Addis Combe and a whole lot of other schools were basically founded to staff the British

481
00:23:30,044 --> 00:23:31,205
imperial venture abroad.

482
00:23:32,132 --> 00:23:33,862
because they needed clerks, right, in India.

483
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:35,090
So.

484
00:23:36,265 --> 00:23:40,608
What Mangan talks about is like games, early games,

485
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:42,610
were not about being fit or having fun.

486
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:45,832
Like the delight part was just the lure.

487
00:23:46,012 --> 00:23:47,934
It was just the loot box to get you to play again.

488
00:23:48,114 --> 00:23:51,196
Actually, there was an ideological program at work.

489
00:23:51,236 --> 00:23:52,357
And here's how he describes it.

490
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:54,819
Basically, the school administrators

491
00:23:54,859 --> 00:23:57,020
were convinced in the desirability of games,

492
00:23:57,121 --> 00:23:59,422
especially team games in training the young.

493
00:23:59,562 --> 00:24:00,423
This is a quote from him.

494
00:24:00,803 --> 00:24:02,284
They believed in the value of those games

495
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,966
for the development of ethical behavior.

496
00:24:04,366 --> 00:24:07,569
They had a view of education that was not only national, but also imperial.

497
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:10,753
They saw it as their duty to give a lead to the imperial world.

498
00:24:11,193 --> 00:24:14,837
So all these schools start spreading throughout India, and they're having Indian cricket teams,

499
00:24:14,897 --> 00:24:17,440
and all the best teams in cricket these days are Indian teams.

500
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:23,206
But it was part of the civilizing mission to sort of teach fairness, and to teach rules

501
00:24:23,466 --> 00:24:23,886
and law.

502
00:24:25,362 --> 00:24:30,143
because all of those things reflected the sort of ideological program of the British state.

503
00:24:30,763 --> 00:24:33,724
Now, this can seem a little distant from us, right?

504
00:24:33,784 --> 00:24:38,545
Here we are in San Francisco, GDC, and we are so, so very far from the imperial program.

505
00:24:38,905 --> 00:24:47,048
But what you should know is that this tradition is still very much with us,

506
00:24:47,108 --> 00:24:50,329
and many of you guys are somewhat indoctrinated into it, including myself.

507
00:24:50,429 --> 00:24:51,729
I'm sorry to break your bubble.

508
00:24:52,149 --> 00:24:56,591
So rugby, we know, the game of rugby, it comes in name from the rugby school.

509
00:24:57,051 --> 00:25:03,035
It spawned a whole genre of novels called the British boarding school genre, including

510
00:25:03,055 --> 00:25:07,538
a novel called Tom Brown's School Days, which was the blue point for Harry Potter, of course.

511
00:25:08,979 --> 00:25:11,080
Harry Potter is an English boarding school drama.

512
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:16,063
He's learning right now how to be a good little imperial servant, even though he doesn't think

513
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:16,923
of himself that way.

514
00:25:17,244 --> 00:25:19,825
But if you get good at Quidditch, you'll get good at Empire.

515
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:25,803
Now, the point of all this is not to suggest that fairness is wrong and that sports don't

516
00:25:25,843 --> 00:25:29,066
teach you good things about being a person and existing in society.

517
00:25:29,846 --> 00:25:34,671
It's just that I think that we have a lot to gain from giving ourselves a little bit

518
00:25:34,711 --> 00:25:38,074
of distance from the concept and for starting to imagine.

519
00:25:40,219 --> 00:25:46,567
Or maybe not imagine, but starting to treat the history of fairness as storied, right?

520
00:25:46,847 --> 00:25:53,976
If you are shooting for fairness in a design you're working on, you're making a kind of value judgment.

521
00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:56,820
And you should just keep that in mind as you're peddling your design.

522
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,582
So what happens then?

523
00:25:59,483 --> 00:26:02,706
if we look for a different framework to design from?

524
00:26:03,306 --> 00:26:05,628
Maybe not an overall rejection of fairness,

525
00:26:05,908 --> 00:26:08,250
but just downgrading its value.

526
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:12,553
Suddenly things like spite and being mean for no reason,

527
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:15,296
like what if those are able to do something?

528
00:26:17,197 --> 00:26:19,399
Well, I think when you boil everything away,

529
00:26:20,938 --> 00:26:24,121
This shift in design priorities leads fundamentally

530
00:26:24,261 --> 00:26:28,264
to games where the winner is decided by a cabal

531
00:26:28,584 --> 00:26:31,246
rather than some sense of individual merit.

532
00:26:32,047 --> 00:26:34,128
In other words, we're talking about kingmaking.

533
00:26:35,249 --> 00:26:37,031
This, of course, being an old cover

534
00:26:37,071 --> 00:26:38,892
of the excellent, excellent game Diplomacy.

535
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:47,713
So I want to tell you now and just offer a short defense of kingmaking as a concept and

536
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:52,175
how we can go about that defense and then I'll talk about some design takeaways and

537
00:26:52,215 --> 00:26:54,516
sort of like practical tips for it.

538
00:26:55,056 --> 00:26:58,677
So I want to build this defense first on narrative grounds.

539
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,322
Because I think that games are fundamentally a storytelling medium.

540
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:08,103
Even when we're talking about games like The Estates or Chicago Express

541
00:27:08,183 --> 00:27:10,624
or some nerdy train game that has a spreadsheet in it,

542
00:27:12,065 --> 00:27:15,446
the biggest math fest game is still a storytelling game.

543
00:27:15,526 --> 00:27:17,507
It's communicating a kind of narrative.

544
00:27:18,067 --> 00:27:20,988
And so the critical language that we use to talk about stories

545
00:27:21,128 --> 00:27:23,369
is just well appointed to talk about games.

546
00:27:24,249 --> 00:27:25,090
In this sense...

547
00:27:26,217 --> 00:27:29,939
I think that we can talk about games in terms of cliché.

548
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:35,300
So we know, for instance, that in romantic comedies, or comedies more general in the

549
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,281
classic sense, that they're going to end in a marriage.

550
00:27:39,042 --> 00:27:40,762
That's a narrative cliché.

551
00:27:41,383 --> 00:27:45,824
Likewise, you know that when you're done playing an empire builder that everything that you

552
00:27:45,844 --> 00:27:50,506
did is going to cash out in really neat sets of three to one, like gold to victory point.

553
00:27:50,967 --> 00:27:53,908
Because we've got to tighten those scores somehow and make everybody feel like they

554
00:27:53,928 --> 00:27:57,389
were close to the end of the game, even though it was no contest at all.

555
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:04,892
And these clichés can be frustrating because I'm sure you've had the thought watching a

556
00:28:04,912 --> 00:28:07,993
romantic comedy that it would have been much better if she would have left him at the end

557
00:28:08,013 --> 00:28:10,735
of the first act and the movie would have been much more interesting if she had just

558
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:11,495
gone on a road trip.

559
00:28:12,275 --> 00:28:17,237
But the song and dance of going through the building of an engine and its scoring.

560
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:21,022
is it's circumscribing the possible expression.

561
00:28:21,082 --> 00:28:22,984
And again, and I'll say this several more times,

562
00:28:23,304 --> 00:28:25,086
this isn't to suggest that those games are wrong.

563
00:28:25,106 --> 00:28:27,468
I love both of these games, especially Race.

564
00:28:28,529 --> 00:28:30,771
And I think that they are worth designing, playing,

565
00:28:30,791 --> 00:28:33,173
and there's still a lot of room to explore there.

566
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:36,255
But we shouldn't allow that kind of genre

567
00:28:36,295 --> 00:28:39,458
to dominate our larger thinking about games.

568
00:28:41,366 --> 00:28:45,330
Kingmaking, in this sense, offers an alternative type

569
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,791
of storytelling.

570
00:28:47,011 --> 00:28:49,674
It allows designers and players to tap

571
00:28:49,714 --> 00:28:53,758
into a really long tradition of betrayal and manipulation

572
00:28:53,818 --> 00:28:55,380
that's as old as narrative itself.

573
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,682
And it forms the foundation for a lot of media

574
00:28:57,702 --> 00:29:00,445
that we enjoy today, from The Bachelor to Game of Thrones.

575
00:29:01,165 --> 00:29:03,568
And there's no reason why we shouldn't

576
00:29:03,628 --> 00:29:04,929
play with those concepts.

577
00:29:07,255 --> 00:29:13,280
When we talk about the engine builder, the primary sort of motif is construction.

578
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,061
It's progressive.

579
00:29:15,282 --> 00:29:24,369
I won't go into Whig history because I'll bore you guys all to death, but what Kingmaking

580
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:29,294
offers us is perhaps the most powerful narrative tool that any writer has ever used, which

581
00:29:29,354 --> 00:29:31,035
is to say it allows you to use irony.

582
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:35,775
It allows you to tell a story of revenge and redemption without worrying that everyone's

583
00:29:35,795 --> 00:29:37,356
going to feel that they were fairly treated.

584
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:39,598
It just opens up the kind of stories that you can tell.

585
00:29:40,219 --> 00:29:42,080
Now a quick sidebar to note that

586
00:29:42,703 --> 00:29:45,764
One space in games that has been really exploring this area

587
00:29:45,944 --> 00:29:47,924
is the single session RPG.

588
00:29:48,964 --> 00:29:50,085
There's a lot of interesting work

589
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:52,025
happening with independent RPG makers

590
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,186
that it's well worth viewing.

591
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:55,986
And even if playing D&D makes you

592
00:29:56,006 --> 00:29:57,567
self-conscious or uncomfortable, you

593
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,187
should buy some of the books I'm going

594
00:29:59,207 --> 00:30:00,607
to mention here in a second, because they

595
00:30:00,647 --> 00:30:01,928
are very, very interesting.

596
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:04,657
just from their formal perspective.

597
00:30:04,977 --> 00:30:07,840
And here I'm thinking about Avery Adler's The Quiet Year

598
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,681
and all of the rest of the games she's produced.

599
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:13,885
And a game by a company called Thorny Games called Dialect.

600
00:30:14,705 --> 00:30:15,926
These are games that really upset

601
00:30:16,767 --> 00:30:18,248
what you might think is even possible

602
00:30:18,268 --> 00:30:19,109
in the space of a game.

603
00:30:19,129 --> 00:30:20,050
And even if you don't play them,

604
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,951
the rules are powerful enough.

605
00:30:23,853 --> 00:30:27,055
Okay, so if we are going to build games about

606
00:30:28,174 --> 00:30:30,255
kingmaking, we need a different framework.

607
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,275
We can't use fairness as the bedrock

608
00:30:32,635 --> 00:30:34,055
to build our design practice on.

609
00:30:34,095 --> 00:30:35,015
We have to find something else.

610
00:30:36,036 --> 00:30:36,816
So what do we find?

611
00:30:37,376 --> 00:30:40,997
Well, some people would jump to this gentleman over here,

612
00:30:41,017 --> 00:30:44,477
Renier Kinizia, who has made a few games.

613
00:30:45,138 --> 00:30:46,938
And he has this quote that you will see

614
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:48,478
like tacked onto profiles.

615
00:30:49,619 --> 00:30:50,559
And I'll just, I'll read it here.

616
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:51,959
When playing a game, the goal is to win.

617
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:55,232
But it is the goal that is important, not the winning.

618
00:30:55,652 --> 00:30:57,453
This is a little bit like the old canard

619
00:30:57,594 --> 00:31:01,256
about the journey being more important than the destination.

620
00:31:01,716 --> 00:31:02,196
And it's fine.

621
00:31:03,926 --> 00:31:07,309
The main problem with it is it's relentlessly individualistic.

622
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:10,692
It's about your personal experience of encountering the game,

623
00:31:11,073 --> 00:31:13,215
which I think, while that's a nice thought,

624
00:31:13,335 --> 00:31:16,978
it doesn't get into what makes something like Kingmaking so difficult,

625
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:20,482
which is to say that my personal journey is going to intersect with yours,

626
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,665
and one of us is going to rob the other and continue the journey.

627
00:31:24,232 --> 00:31:31,394
So, in sort of searching for a new framework, I found myself reaching for Bernie DeKoven's

628
00:31:31,494 --> 00:31:39,017
amazing 1978 book, The Well-Played Game, which I think is just an unbelievable text and one

629
00:31:39,037 --> 00:31:41,318
that anybody interested in design should check out.

630
00:31:41,418 --> 00:31:45,620
And in Bernie DeKoven's book, he has this really wonderful distinction he makes between

631
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,400
playing to win and having to win.

632
00:31:48,161 --> 00:31:50,142
And there's a way that...

633
00:31:51,698 --> 00:31:55,405
This could be described simply as like another version of what Kinesia is talking about,

634
00:31:55,746 --> 00:31:58,812
but for De Koven, it has nothing to do with individual experience.

635
00:31:59,694 --> 00:32:01,978
Basically, when you play to win, you must win.

636
00:32:03,136 --> 00:32:04,876
Okay, cool. Everyone's always playing to win.

637
00:32:05,417 --> 00:32:08,678
But when you have to win, you must win because

638
00:32:09,258 --> 00:32:12,259
you are unsure of your own position in the community of players.

639
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:15,700
And only by winning can you kind of prove yourself in that position.

640
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,220
So basically, you know, if you think about

641
00:32:18,761 --> 00:32:22,002
all of the theory around the magic circle and the exceptional space of the game...

642
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:29,101
What DeKoven is talking about is if you don't close that circle entirely and you bring in

643
00:32:29,161 --> 00:32:32,643
some of the outside world into your game, you're going to get people who are going to

644
00:32:32,683 --> 00:32:36,785
try to use the game as a way to manipulate the world outside of the game and that's where

645
00:32:36,805 --> 00:32:38,025
all the bad feelings come from.

646
00:32:40,342 --> 00:32:42,363
So he has a short note on this.

647
00:32:42,383 --> 00:32:44,284
I'm just going to, I didn't put this up,

648
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:47,426
but I think for those of you who are interested in DeKoven's

649
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:49,047
work, it can all be pretty much summed up

650
00:32:49,087 --> 00:32:50,708
in this kind of short little snippet.

651
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:53,570
He describes games in this way.

652
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:54,290
This is a quote.

653
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,011
We were willing to play.

654
00:32:56,171 --> 00:32:58,052
We were each willing to play the particular game.

655
00:32:58,392 --> 00:32:59,473
We were willing to play with each other.

656
00:32:59,493 --> 00:33:01,594
And we arrived at the well-played game

657
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:03,575
because of the way we combined with the game.

658
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:07,682
Now, that's a little like woo-woo by today's standards,

659
00:33:07,742 --> 00:33:10,044
and know that if you do buy a copy of The Well-Played Game,

660
00:33:10,264 --> 00:33:12,567
an excellent book, it's entirely like that.

661
00:33:12,707 --> 00:33:14,709
It's like a giant stream of consciousness,

662
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,651
exploration of play.

663
00:33:18,012 --> 00:33:20,855
But I think what is so powerful about DeKoven's idea is

664
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:20,995
to

665
00:33:23,288 --> 00:33:25,990
back out from the individual instance of the game

666
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:28,613
and to really reassert the power of play

667
00:33:29,033 --> 00:33:31,475
as the thing that the game is allowing you to do.

668
00:33:31,856 --> 00:33:34,298
The game is the medium that allows players

669
00:33:34,358 --> 00:33:35,479
to interact with each other.

670
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,142
And if you are having the perfect experience of play,

671
00:33:39,543 --> 00:33:42,285
the victory is putting everybody on the same page,

672
00:33:42,665 --> 00:33:44,187
but it doesn't necessarily have to be the thing

673
00:33:44,407 --> 00:33:45,488
that is keeping them there.

674
00:33:47,049 --> 00:33:48,931
So, thinking about.

675
00:33:50,021 --> 00:33:51,321
as a foundation for kingmaking,

676
00:33:51,581 --> 00:33:53,582
I want to talk a little bit about some takeaways.

677
00:33:53,982 --> 00:33:55,342
What are some things that we can do

678
00:33:55,663 --> 00:33:56,983
with this alternate framework?

679
00:33:57,083 --> 00:34:00,104
A framework that doesn't overly emphasize fairness.

680
00:34:00,924 --> 00:34:03,105
Well, I think that I have a kind of set of rules

681
00:34:03,145 --> 00:34:04,686
that I think about when I'm working on a design,

682
00:34:04,746 --> 00:34:06,326
especially a design that I know

683
00:34:06,386 --> 00:34:07,907
is going to feature a lot of kingmaking.

684
00:34:08,987 --> 00:34:10,948
The first rule is that, as in all things,

685
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:12,749
consent is absolutely critical.

686
00:34:13,089 --> 00:34:15,109
You do not want to misdirect your players.

687
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,350
It's really important that everybody realizes

688
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:19,051
what kind of game they're going to play.

689
00:34:21,129 --> 00:34:24,170
Dukovin has an interesting chapter in the well-played game where he talks about something

690
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,370
called the dangerous game.

691
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:32,833
And he notes in this chapter that dangerous games cannot involve people who haven't accepted

692
00:34:32,873 --> 00:34:35,674
the threat or haven't chosen to play the dangerous game.

693
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:39,475
Now, this is a really interesting kind of two-tiered view of this.

694
00:34:39,835 --> 00:34:41,496
It's a little bit like watching a horror movie.

695
00:34:41,936 --> 00:34:45,657
You obviously would never want to watch a horror movie with somebody who hates horror

696
00:34:45,697 --> 00:34:45,997
movies.

697
00:34:47,695 --> 00:34:48,855
And so that's obviously bad.

698
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:51,757
But what is less obviously bad, but what is still bad,

699
00:34:51,877 --> 00:34:53,958
is watching a horror movie where half the people

700
00:34:53,998 --> 00:34:55,418
like watching it because they think it's funny,

701
00:34:55,979 --> 00:34:57,559
and the other half the people like watching it

702
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:58,720
because they think it's scary.

703
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:03,482
Each of those, that heterogeneity and that viewing base

704
00:35:04,002 --> 00:35:05,663
really can hurt an experience.

705
00:35:05,723 --> 00:35:07,024
And so for DeKoven, it's important,

706
00:35:07,044 --> 00:35:08,365
if you want to play a dangerous game,

707
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:11,386
to agree to play it, but then also to accept the danger.

708
00:35:12,367 --> 00:35:14,468
So, you should be honest about it.

709
00:35:14,548 --> 00:35:14,668
Now,

710
00:35:16,264 --> 00:35:20,729
It's also important to realize that if you are designing a game about king making,

711
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:23,632
that the relationships between the players, that's everything.

712
00:35:24,112 --> 00:35:27,636
Mechanisms do not matter so much as the relationships to the player,

713
00:35:27,656 --> 00:35:30,799
and this is a very easy thing to forget when you're working in design.

714
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:38,747
What will happen sometimes is when the relationships between the players are not highlighted,

715
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:41,533
the interactions, the king-making interaction

716
00:35:41,553 --> 00:35:44,338
in the last stage of the game can feel like a cruel joke.

717
00:35:44,398 --> 00:35:46,521
If I've been hoarding stone the entire game

718
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,923
so I can upgrade my clay house,

719
00:35:48,363 --> 00:35:50,126
and you take it from me in the last turn

720
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:52,329
despite never touching me the entire game,

721
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:53,751
it's not going to feel like

722
00:35:54,512 --> 00:35:57,153
an ironic coup or something worth thinking about.

723
00:35:57,413 --> 00:35:58,794
It's just going to feel like a bad joke.

724
00:35:59,274 --> 00:36:01,114
And this, I think, brings me to Risk,

725
00:36:01,174 --> 00:36:03,855
which I think is still just a brilliant and wonderful game.

726
00:36:04,256 --> 00:36:06,376
Maybe more fun to think about than to play.

727
00:36:06,796 --> 00:36:08,597
But one of the real tricks of Risk

728
00:36:08,677 --> 00:36:10,418
is that there's no negative space on the board.

729
00:36:10,958 --> 00:36:12,978
So what kind of game are you playing when you play Risk?

730
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:14,819
Well, it's a game where you're going to hurt each other,

731
00:36:14,899 --> 00:36:16,100
and there's no way to get around it.

732
00:36:17,078 --> 00:36:21,659
I often wonder, a lot of space 4X games have this problem where the first third of the

733
00:36:21,699 --> 00:36:26,381
game is very quiet and it's about synergies and building up, and then in the second half

734
00:36:26,401 --> 00:36:29,862
you tear down all the work you did in the first half, and it usually makes people feel

735
00:36:29,962 --> 00:36:30,302
rotten.

736
00:36:30,642 --> 00:36:33,983
And I think if the board started full, you would get around this problem.

737
00:36:34,423 --> 00:36:35,644
This is one reason, by the way, in Root...

738
00:36:36,845 --> 00:36:38,406
the board starts completely full.

739
00:36:38,987 --> 00:36:41,428
And the primary aggressor in the game,

740
00:36:42,389 --> 00:36:43,910
the faction called the Eerie Dynasties,

741
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:45,531
they're playing a program game

742
00:36:45,911 --> 00:36:48,973
where they are literally having to program in attacks

743
00:36:49,433 --> 00:36:50,854
so that they have sort of deniability.

744
00:36:50,874 --> 00:36:52,295
They're like, I didn't mean to attack you.

745
00:36:52,715 --> 00:36:54,637
It's just that's what I promised I would do

746
00:36:54,677 --> 00:36:55,497
for the rest of the game.

747
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:01,192
So another note about this is,

748
00:37:02,092 --> 00:37:06,695
another interesting line about that kind of thematic

749
00:37:06,735 --> 00:37:09,196
and mechanical cohesion is a comparison

750
00:37:09,216 --> 00:37:11,257
between something like Inish and Blood Rage.

751
00:37:11,857 --> 00:37:14,058
So these are both like, if you look at just the boxes

752
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:15,679
and the pieces, you're like, oh yeah,

753
00:37:15,699 --> 00:37:17,460
there's some war happening in these boxes.

754
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,361
In Inish, you fight all the time.

755
00:37:20,817 --> 00:37:21,678
Oh, it's a fighting game.

756
00:37:21,798 --> 00:37:22,738
It's a very fighting game.

757
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:25,280
But Blood Rage is really more of like a drafting game.

758
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,861
It's like much closer to Sushi Go than it is to Risk.

759
00:37:28,201 --> 00:37:29,962
And that isn't to denigrate Blood Rage.

760
00:37:30,002 --> 00:37:32,384
I think Eric Ling's brilliant and he did a good job with it.

761
00:37:33,264 --> 00:37:35,766
But it can create weird moments

762
00:37:35,826 --> 00:37:37,146
because there are times when like.

763
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:39,571
you thought you were playing a drafting game,

764
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,812
but then it slides into being a little bit of a war game,

765
00:37:41,852 --> 00:37:44,393
and it feels like not at ease with itself.

766
00:37:44,894 --> 00:37:47,635
Whereas in Inish, you're playing a drafting game,

767
00:37:47,695 --> 00:37:50,117
but the drafting game is entirely about action denial

768
00:37:50,277 --> 00:37:50,937
and about fighting.

769
00:37:52,498 --> 00:37:54,439
So the third thing I think that's very important

770
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:57,561
is to give players diplomatic flexibility.

771
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,021
There aren't villains in real life.

772
00:38:01,081 --> 00:38:02,782
We have partners and we have adversaries.

773
00:38:02,962 --> 00:38:05,244
And sometimes our partners become our adversaries.

774
00:38:05,484 --> 00:38:09,547
And sometimes we need to find partners

775
00:38:09,727 --> 00:38:10,868
in those who oppose us.

776
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:14,771
No diplomacy system you design is going to be

777
00:38:14,831 --> 00:38:16,332
as clever as your players.

778
00:38:16,672 --> 00:38:18,133
So you want to try to give them

779
00:38:18,193 --> 00:38:19,934
the most creative framework.

780
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:21,861
that they could possibly exist in.

781
00:38:21,881 --> 00:38:24,424
I think this is one reason why turn-based strategy games,

782
00:38:25,005 --> 00:38:26,166
especially on the digital side,

783
00:38:26,206 --> 00:38:27,848
really struggle with their diplomacy systems.

784
00:38:27,928 --> 00:38:31,372
It's just hard to create the sort of freewheeling

785
00:38:31,793 --> 00:38:35,678
deal-making that you see in a game like diplomacy

786
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:37,560
in a digital space.

787
00:38:40,843 --> 00:38:44,905
The last takeaway is I think the most complicated one,

788
00:38:44,965 --> 00:38:47,667
and it's the one that I'm the most unsure of personally.

789
00:38:48,087 --> 00:38:50,288
And this has to do with the management of hope

790
00:38:50,849 --> 00:38:51,529
and of victory.

791
00:38:51,949 --> 00:38:54,491
So victory conditions I think are the most critical element

792
00:38:54,591 --> 00:38:55,631
of any game design.

793
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,653
In my own practice, they are the very first thing

794
00:38:58,953 --> 00:39:02,615
that I put to page, and they are the last thing

795
00:39:02,635 --> 00:39:03,896
that I ever want to tamper with.

796
00:39:04,677 --> 00:39:07,278
The victory conditions put everybody together.

797
00:39:07,458 --> 00:39:08,478
They're like the script.

798
00:39:08,578 --> 00:39:09,979
Even more than the rest of the rules,

799
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:12,419
the victory conditions bind the players together.

800
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,641
But you run into a problem once another player can't win.

801
00:39:16,241 --> 00:39:19,242
And here I often think of Martin Wallace's 2001 game,

802
00:39:19,282 --> 00:39:19,582
Liberté.

803
00:39:19,602 --> 00:39:22,283
One of the things that's great about Wallace titles

804
00:39:22,603 --> 00:39:25,424
is I feel like he must design very quickly because he

805
00:39:25,464 --> 00:39:26,645
doesn't cover his tracks.

806
00:39:27,185 --> 00:39:31,346
You can sort of see all of the development in the game just by looking at the final game.

807
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,786
And so Liberté is a game about the French Revolution.

808
00:39:33,846 --> 00:39:35,007
It's an election game.

809
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:40,028
But the way the math of the elections works out, certain factions, certain players are

810
00:39:40,048 --> 00:39:41,188
always going to be like way ahead.

811
00:39:41,668 --> 00:39:44,509
Like after the first election, a couple of players are going to win like eight points

812
00:39:44,589 --> 00:39:46,629
and then every, you can even see it in the screenshot actually.

813
00:39:46,949 --> 00:39:49,970
Like those two people did very well and everyone else is just dead last.

814
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:51,530
And this will always happen.

815
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:53,010
This isn't like bad play.

816
00:39:53,311 --> 00:39:54,972
And in fact, in the next election,

817
00:39:55,052 --> 00:39:56,533
those people who are ahead, they're

818
00:39:56,553 --> 00:39:57,773
going to get more ahead.

819
00:39:58,594 --> 00:39:59,855
And the way Wallace dealt with this,

820
00:39:59,895 --> 00:40:02,536
instead of fixing the kind of core math problem that

821
00:40:02,556 --> 00:40:06,279
was producing this result, is he created two alternate victory

822
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:09,000
conditions, misery conditions, or what they're actually

823
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:11,842
called, whereby the players who are losing

824
00:40:12,002 --> 00:40:13,483
can kind of flip the table over.

825
00:40:13,643 --> 00:40:15,424
And they have totally different ways of winning

826
00:40:16,225 --> 00:40:18,006
that are so dangerous you would never do it

827
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,708
unless there was no chance you were going to win by points.

828
00:40:21,348 --> 00:40:24,651
And what this does is even until the very, very last moment,

829
00:40:25,312 --> 00:40:27,894
all players remain kind of in the game.

830
00:40:28,715 --> 00:40:31,297
Now, this to me is a very good idea,

831
00:40:31,317 --> 00:40:34,420
and I like it, and I build alternate victory conditions

832
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,021
in almost every game that I've worked on.

833
00:40:36,562 --> 00:40:39,805
But I wonder too, if there's another way

834
00:40:39,825 --> 00:40:43,248
of thinking about victory that isn't so straightjacketed.

835
00:40:45,775 --> 00:40:48,196
have to think about the games of Phil Eklund.

836
00:40:48,777 --> 00:40:50,457
Because the thing about Phil Eklund's games,

837
00:40:50,678 --> 00:40:52,579
they're immensely complicated and goofy

838
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:54,780
and they're extremely random and mean.

839
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,081
So this is a shot from High Frontier.

840
00:40:58,142 --> 00:40:59,783
If you can believe it, this is like 1 20th

841
00:41:00,503 --> 00:41:01,524
of what the board looks like.

842
00:41:02,184 --> 00:41:04,005
And it is that complicated all the way through.

843
00:41:04,912 --> 00:41:10,556
And in High Frontier, I once spent an hour planning a mission to one of Jupiter's moons,

844
00:41:10,756 --> 00:41:16,060
and then the mission was about halfway through and I hit a radiation belt wrong, and one

845
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:21,284
of my spaceship components blew up, and I spent the next hour, like hour of game time,

846
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:26,188
attempting to rescue my poor astronauts who were drifting to one Lagrange point or another.

847
00:41:27,571 --> 00:41:28,291
And it was great.

848
00:41:28,892 --> 00:41:31,773
And there's this amazing thing about Eklund's games

849
00:41:31,953 --> 00:41:36,276
where the story that the game is telling is so bracing,

850
00:41:36,336 --> 00:41:39,438
is so powerful, that even when you're out of condition,

851
00:41:39,858 --> 00:41:43,900
out of contention for victory, you don't want to unplug.

852
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,601
You don't wanna un-immerse yourself.

853
00:41:45,641 --> 00:41:46,822
And this is what usually happens.

854
00:41:47,102 --> 00:41:48,683
If the victory condition is the only thing

855
00:41:49,063 --> 00:41:50,464
that is immersing your players,

856
00:41:50,884 --> 00:41:52,285
then you need to create a system

857
00:41:52,305 --> 00:41:54,106
where the players always have a chance to win.

858
00:41:54,686 --> 00:41:56,668
But if the other storytelling techniques

859
00:41:57,148 --> 00:41:59,410
are giving them something, then the victory condition

860
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:01,792
starts to be a little less important.

861
00:42:03,393 --> 00:42:06,176
So I want to close with a short quota,

862
00:42:06,196 --> 00:42:08,197
and then we'll have about 15 minutes for questions,

863
00:42:09,418 --> 00:42:11,240
which is to talk a little bit about video games,

864
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,942
since this is primarily a video game design conference.

865
00:42:14,442 --> 00:42:16,564
So one of the funny things is that the space

866
00:42:16,584 --> 00:42:19,206
that I work in in design, these multilateral conflict games,

867
00:42:19,587 --> 00:42:20,828
video games are really bad at them.

868
00:42:21,108 --> 00:42:21,728
Like, horrible.

869
00:42:21,768 --> 00:42:25,510
Like, if you've ever played a game of StarCraft in the free-for-all mode, I'm just sorry.

870
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:27,991
Because the games just aren't designed for it.

871
00:42:28,031 --> 00:42:32,952
I mean, even multiplayer competitive games, if you think about something like Dota or

872
00:42:32,992 --> 00:42:37,494
any of the other MOBAs, I mean, or Counter-Strike, these are 5v5s, these are team sports.

873
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:43,657
In terms of the actual game theory, we're talking about formally two-player games, even

874
00:42:43,697 --> 00:42:45,617
if they have multiple humans involved.

875
00:42:46,037 --> 00:42:48,438
Or cooperative experiences, something like Overcooked.

876
00:42:49,857 --> 00:42:53,899
Games just really aren't, digital games, they have a hard time with the free-for-all game,

877
00:42:54,580 --> 00:43:00,583
with the exception of something that's happened in the past couple years, which is to say the rise of the Battle Royale.

878
00:43:02,384 --> 00:43:09,687
I think that these are the most important games that have been developed since Minecraft, and probably even maybe more important because they are truly

879
00:43:10,228 --> 00:43:17,832
multilateral conflict games, and even if you hate them, if you've played them, you probably have memories from the games you have played.

880
00:43:18,272 --> 00:43:20,274
You've played games where you've randomly died,

881
00:43:20,294 --> 00:43:23,397
and then the rest of your squad has attempted to avenge you

882
00:43:23,477 --> 00:43:26,120
as they hunted your killer over the battlefield.

883
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,002
And you watched them with rapt attention

884
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,363
because even though your character was dead,

885
00:43:29,824 --> 00:43:30,985
you were still in the game.

886
00:43:31,766 --> 00:43:34,649
They have amazing storytelling capacity.

887
00:43:34,689 --> 00:43:36,771
When we talk about open world games, we usually...

888
00:43:37,779 --> 00:43:42,042
are not talking about open world so much as a very full world,

889
00:43:42,102 --> 00:43:43,903
where every nook and cranny of a setting

890
00:43:43,943 --> 00:43:47,125
has all these little side plots and branching narratives in it.

891
00:43:47,746 --> 00:43:49,647
For my money, the Battle Royale games

892
00:43:49,687 --> 00:43:51,789
are the only true open world games out there,

893
00:43:52,289 --> 00:43:54,891
because it's really emergent what can happen.

894
00:43:54,951 --> 00:43:56,653
You have no idea the kind of story

895
00:43:56,673 --> 00:43:58,914
that each match is going to tell, outside of the fact

896
00:43:58,934 --> 00:44:01,056
that you need to spend your first 10 minutes feverishly

897
00:44:01,136 --> 00:44:02,717
looting before you get shot.

898
00:44:05,133 --> 00:44:09,357
And, you know, I've been talking mostly about storytelling and not so much like mechanisms

899
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:12,541
and strategy, although we can go into that in the Q&A if you'd like, but one thing I

900
00:44:12,581 --> 00:44:18,026
will say is these games also produce really interesting strategic concerns.

901
00:44:18,847 --> 00:44:23,913
If you are on, you know, a hill watching the last two squads, or maybe the last two squads,

902
00:44:23,993 --> 00:44:25,314
fight and exhaust themselves...

903
00:44:26,274 --> 00:44:28,235
you might want to intervene and get that loot.

904
00:44:28,755 --> 00:44:30,416
But if you fire your weapons, you

905
00:44:30,496 --> 00:44:33,077
might telegraph your position to those squads

906
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:34,937
or to another squad that might be watching you.

907
00:44:35,477 --> 00:44:38,919
There are all these concerns about position, exposure,

908
00:44:38,959 --> 00:44:39,639
and supply.

909
00:44:39,959 --> 00:44:42,080
These are really interesting strategic concerns

910
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,621
that are only made possible because we're dealing

911
00:44:44,661 --> 00:44:46,321
with a multilateral conflict.

912
00:44:46,922 --> 00:44:52,086
So in short, I think that by looking at games which are about kingmaking and which really,

913
00:44:52,266 --> 00:44:58,391
frankly, address problems of multiplayer and rather address problems of the multilateral

914
00:45:00,192 --> 00:45:01,593
Let me start that over.

915
00:45:01,993 --> 00:45:07,058
So in short, what I'm trying to say is, basically, designs that feature high player interaction,

916
00:45:07,078 --> 00:45:11,683
that feature multilateral conflict, I think they've got big storytelling payoffs that

917
00:45:11,723 --> 00:45:15,686
are worth investigating, and I also think that they also have big strategic payoffs.

918
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:20,831
And there's a whole world of different sorts of designs that we just sort of need to explore,

919
00:45:20,871 --> 00:45:25,415
but part of that is realizing our own assumptions about the kind of games that we value.

920
00:45:26,444 --> 00:45:28,225
deciding whether or not we might wanna challenge

921
00:45:28,245 --> 00:45:29,126
some of those assumptions.

922
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:30,387
All right, thank you guys.

923
00:45:37,251 --> 00:45:38,532
So there's a mic in the center of the room.

924
00:45:39,273 --> 00:45:41,314
I'm happy to take any and all questions

925
00:45:42,415 --> 00:45:43,776
relating to this talk or anything else.

926
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,201
And go ahead and tell me your name and where you're from.

927
00:45:51,221 --> 00:45:54,483
Hi, John Peeble from Tucson, Arizona.

928
00:45:55,223 --> 00:45:55,984
Great talk, thank you.

929
00:45:57,191 --> 00:46:01,553
Just a quick comment, just played Liberté two weeks ago and pulled off a Royalist win

930
00:46:01,593 --> 00:46:02,133
in turn three.

931
00:46:02,714 --> 00:46:03,514
Very satisfying.

932
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:03,934
Excellent.

933
00:46:05,155 --> 00:46:06,255
And two questions for you.

934
00:46:06,295 --> 00:46:11,418
First, you mentioned about the disconnect between luring players into an experience

935
00:46:11,438 --> 00:46:12,779
they might not be prepared for.

936
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:18,382
Can you talk about any concerns your team had about the Q-art and the actual gameplay

937
00:46:18,562 --> 00:46:18,842
of Root?

938
00:46:19,272 --> 00:46:21,695
So that is a great, great question, thank you.

939
00:46:21,755 --> 00:46:22,195
John, right?

940
00:46:23,396 --> 00:46:24,217
Correct.

941
00:46:24,237 --> 00:46:25,898
So we work a little strangely

942
00:46:26,539 --> 00:46:28,441
compared to other game studios,

943
00:46:28,641 --> 00:46:30,362
so in terms of other publishers.

944
00:46:30,403 --> 00:46:31,524
So we're a little game studio.

945
00:46:31,584 --> 00:46:33,105
We all pretty much work in one room

946
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:34,747
and then our artist is remote

947
00:46:35,247 --> 00:46:36,888
and we take every product we work on

948
00:46:37,029 --> 00:46:39,271
from the cradle to the grave altogether.

949
00:46:39,731 --> 00:46:44,213
Which means when Patrick said, hey, I want to do an asymmetric strategy game, and I said,

950
00:46:44,313 --> 00:46:49,415
cool, I want to make it be about counterinsurgency, the question of where we set it and how it

951
00:46:49,455 --> 00:46:52,456
appears, that was a day two question for us.

952
00:46:52,636 --> 00:46:57,618
And we spent a lot of time talking with our artist Kyle Farrin about how we were going

953
00:46:57,638 --> 00:46:58,739
to go about presenting it.

954
00:46:59,299 --> 00:47:03,100
And early on, we kind of arrived at a strategy, which was...

955
00:47:04,376 --> 00:47:07,038
So there are sort of two problems with introductory war games.

956
00:47:07,778 --> 00:47:11,821
Problem one is introductory war games play nothing like actual war games.

957
00:47:11,861 --> 00:47:14,443
And I think Blood Rage is quite instructive here, right?

958
00:47:14,463 --> 00:47:15,664
Like Blood Rage is a drafting game.

959
00:47:16,524 --> 00:47:20,867
It's not a war game, I think, in any kind of meaningful sense, and I don't think anybody

960
00:47:21,648 --> 00:47:22,408
– that's a bit of a straw man.

961
00:47:22,428 --> 00:47:23,849
I don't think anybody would necessarily defend that.

962
00:47:25,487 --> 00:47:26,908
So that's problem one, right?

963
00:47:26,928 --> 00:47:29,471
So we wanted to make sure that if this was an introductory game,

964
00:47:29,731 --> 00:47:32,614
that it was actually going to show people

965
00:47:32,675 --> 00:47:34,076
what the other games looked like.

966
00:47:34,517 --> 00:47:36,799
The other problem that introductory games have

967
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:40,703
is that they try to bring people into the hobby,

968
00:47:40,904 --> 00:47:45,368
but they do it in a way that isn't actually that accessible.

969
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:47,571
So Blood Rage has really intense art.

970
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:50,502
It's just a lot of like blood and brawny guys.

971
00:47:50,682 --> 00:47:53,165
And even like memoir, which is a little more cartoony,

972
00:47:53,585 --> 00:47:55,748
is a game for like your uncle or dad, right?

973
00:47:55,768 --> 00:47:57,690
It's like, oh cool, World War II, yes.

974
00:47:58,291 --> 00:48:02,095
So we wanted a theme that really tried to broaden things out.

975
00:48:02,355 --> 00:48:05,138
And so Kyle, we were working on this adventure game,

976
00:48:06,219 --> 00:48:09,203
and Kyle was setting it in this sort of Robin Hood-esque.

977
00:48:09,709 --> 00:48:16,293
animal world and it occurred to us that that actually might be the perfect way to theme

978
00:48:17,253 --> 00:48:22,416
the game because it gives you a kind of step of distance from the violence a little bit.

979
00:48:22,917 --> 00:48:31,062
So the meanness in Root isn't often nasty, it's more like comical and that distance we

980
00:48:31,102 --> 00:48:36,165
could use to put a lot of actual like really harsh interaction in the design.

981
00:48:36,533 --> 00:48:40,335
So we sort of calibrated it to give people enough space

982
00:48:40,555 --> 00:48:41,135
to address it.

983
00:48:41,175 --> 00:48:44,377
We also, so this came up in the Keyforge talk,

984
00:48:44,397 --> 00:48:45,337
which I thought was really interesting.

985
00:48:45,697 --> 00:48:47,998
We really consciously avoided any direct theming

986
00:48:48,238 --> 00:48:49,458
when it came to the design.

987
00:48:49,979 --> 00:48:53,900
Because I don't care if your woodland alliance are Marxists

988
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,421
or if they're like militia radicals.

989
00:48:56,941 --> 00:48:58,982
I want the players to be able to kind of like

990
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:00,303
fill in the ideologies.

991
00:49:00,803 --> 00:49:02,844
So all the different player positions are presented

992
00:49:03,304 --> 00:49:06,166
with some ambiguity so that the players can kind of project

993
00:49:06,206 --> 00:49:07,146
and inhabit the world.

994
00:49:07,566 --> 00:49:09,347
And one of the best ways we could do that was kind of

995
00:49:09,387 --> 00:49:10,688
putting it in the storybook setting.

996
00:49:11,629 --> 00:49:12,349
Thank you for that question.

997
00:49:12,829 --> 00:49:14,150
And then one more for you.

998
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:15,191
Go ahead.

999
00:49:15,251 --> 00:49:19,253
A lot of talk has been made about the coin series and that

1000
00:49:19,293 --> 00:49:20,353
being somewhat of an influence.

1001
00:49:20,433 --> 00:49:22,795
I was just curious if they were an influence on this

1002
00:49:22,815 --> 00:49:23,135
design.

1003
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:25,216
So they were totally an influence.

1004
00:49:25,316 --> 00:49:27,337
I've been playing the coin game since Andy and Abyss

1005
00:49:27,437 --> 00:49:28,077
first came out.

1006
00:49:30,013 --> 00:49:34,501
I try to wear all my influences on my sleeve as best as I can, so I talked about the coin

1007
00:49:34,521 --> 00:49:38,429
games and I think a lot of people were expecting it to be a little bit more closely modeled

1008
00:49:38,509 --> 00:49:40,293
after the actual mechanics of a coin game.

1009
00:49:40,787 --> 00:49:42,728
But by the time the design comes out

1010
00:49:42,748 --> 00:49:44,009
at the other end of my process,

1011
00:49:44,129 --> 00:49:46,370
it's hard to track where the influences were.

1012
00:49:46,811 --> 00:49:48,511
So the thing I wanted from the coin games

1013
00:49:48,632 --> 00:49:51,213
was the tension between the different player positions.

1014
00:49:52,013 --> 00:49:54,435
I didn't really care about the actual mechanical framework

1015
00:49:54,635 --> 00:49:56,616
that maintains those tensions.

1016
00:49:57,056 --> 00:50:01,098
So I think if you wanna see the comparison

1017
00:50:01,118 --> 00:50:02,019
between the influences.

1018
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,462
You find it less by reading game reviews of a coin game

1019
00:50:06,482 --> 00:50:08,964
compared to a root game, and you find it more

1020
00:50:09,024 --> 00:50:10,686
in the way people talk about the games

1021
00:50:10,766 --> 00:50:12,047
and like the after action reports.

1022
00:50:12,687 --> 00:50:12,968
Thank you.

1023
00:50:13,108 --> 00:50:13,388
Thank you.

1024
00:50:13,708 --> 00:50:14,829
All right, we've got like 10 minutes,

1025
00:50:14,869 --> 00:50:16,991
so I'm gonna be a little bit quicker in my answers.

1026
00:50:17,371 --> 00:50:18,893
Yeah, this is probably gonna be a quick one.

1027
00:50:18,973 --> 00:50:20,114
I'm Hans from Stockholm, Sweden.

1028
00:50:20,474 --> 00:50:20,674
All right.

1029
00:50:20,754 --> 00:50:21,535
A big fan of your work.

1030
00:50:21,775 --> 00:50:22,075
Thank you.

1031
00:50:22,195 --> 00:50:22,716
For the most part.

1032
00:50:23,276 --> 00:50:26,859
But that's on me probably.

1033
00:50:28,501 --> 00:50:29,681
So I've been enjoying,

1034
00:50:30,702 --> 00:50:35,065
you know, but I'm also a bit puzzled about people are like consuming games,

1035
00:50:35,105 --> 00:50:37,967
digital games and board games through Twitch nowadays, right? Like rather than

1036
00:50:38,287 --> 00:50:40,989
playing it yourself and enjoying it, you're watching other people enjoy it.

1037
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:45,151
How do you think like Kingmaking games or games to feature a lot of Kingmaking,

1038
00:50:45,211 --> 00:50:47,353
is that more fun to watch people play?

1039
00:50:47,613 --> 00:50:53,056
Yes. I mean, there is, there is, it is not an accident that Fortnite and Apex

1040
00:50:53,356 --> 00:50:55,678
are like all you see on Twitch. There is something...

1041
00:50:56,349 --> 00:51:01,053
about the storytelling potential of these multilateral conflict games that lends itself

1042
00:51:01,274 --> 00:51:03,095
really well to viewing.

1043
00:51:04,076 --> 00:51:07,539
And we found, I mean, so I've done a little bit of streaming, we actually just built a

1044
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:11,422
streaming set up in our office for Games of Rue, and we found it was really active, people

1045
00:51:11,442 --> 00:51:14,085
were really into it, just coming by and watching.

1046
00:51:16,065 --> 00:51:19,447
One place sort of in meat space that I can talk about this,

1047
00:51:19,567 --> 00:51:21,889
is at a convention we have a weird way of demoing Root.

1048
00:51:22,449 --> 00:51:23,870
At least if I'm working the floor,

1049
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:24,711
this is what I try to do.

1050
00:51:25,251 --> 00:51:27,893
So we set up the game, we give you a little demo,

1051
00:51:27,933 --> 00:51:29,193
and then you play it for 15 minutes,

1052
00:51:29,874 --> 00:51:32,115
and then we kick you out, and we put in the next group,

1053
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,536
but we don't reset the game.

1054
00:51:34,217 --> 00:51:38,358
And so you inherit the player position of the idiot who is sitting there before you.

1055
00:51:38,958 --> 00:51:43,119
And what's interesting is people will come back to the booth and they'll be like, oh,

1056
00:51:43,259 --> 00:51:44,760
how did my little vagabond do?

1057
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:45,300
Is he okay?

1058
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,360
I'm like, no, he's not.

1059
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,461
Everything is messed up.

1060
00:51:48,881 --> 00:51:55,803
But it speaks to that storytelling power and the fun of watching and of sort of moving

1061
00:51:55,843 --> 00:51:56,823
those stories to other forms.

1062
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:59,464
We get a lot of like root fan fiction and fan art.

1063
00:52:00,164 --> 00:52:02,945
And I think it's in part because like the storytelling is so open.

1064
00:52:04,248 --> 00:52:05,949
Cool. Yeah, thank you, Gaul. Yeah, thank you.

1065
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:10,611
Hey, I'm Mark from Creative Assembly in the UK.

1066
00:52:11,272 --> 00:52:14,433
A lot of what you said about kingmaking really rung true

1067
00:52:14,473 --> 00:52:16,074
with my enjoyment of games,

1068
00:52:16,534 --> 00:52:19,136
but what would you say are the main ways

1069
00:52:19,196 --> 00:52:21,317
you've looked at to discourage kingbreaking?

1070
00:52:22,898 --> 00:52:23,998
Can you define kingbreaking?

1071
00:52:24,018 --> 00:52:27,280
Kingbreaking is where you get players who take pleasure

1072
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,802
in not helping someone else to win, but stopping someone.

1073
00:52:31,542 --> 00:52:35,304
Yeah, this is a really essential question, right?

1074
00:52:35,724 --> 00:52:38,566
Because I think that a lot of this has to do

1075
00:52:38,586 --> 00:52:39,526
with the frame of the question.

1076
00:52:39,746 --> 00:52:42,868
So the way I tend to view it is you want to create

1077
00:52:43,288 --> 00:52:45,669
an environment where you are going to be the person

1078
00:52:45,749 --> 00:52:47,050
who is made king.

1079
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:51,292
And so if you're thinking about a strategy guide,

1080
00:52:51,332 --> 00:52:55,694
for instance, if you're worried about players

1081
00:52:55,754 --> 00:52:58,115
bashing the leader, there are ways of playing

1082
00:52:58,155 --> 00:52:58,695
a little bit more.

1083
00:52:59,555 --> 00:53:04,576
defensively they're going to give you coverage, and also then cultivating the kinds of alliances

1084
00:53:04,617 --> 00:53:06,457
that are going to spring to life.

1085
00:53:06,957 --> 00:53:10,959
So one thing, I didn't talk about diplomacy much in this talk, but one of the really interesting

1086
00:53:10,999 --> 00:53:14,920
things that you see sometimes happen in high level diplomacy games is people will make

1087
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,541
agreements that are contingent upon the actions of other players.

1088
00:53:19,002 --> 00:53:24,003
So I'll say like, look, hey Turkey, I know you don't want to fight Austria, but if they

1089
00:53:24,063 --> 00:53:25,444
fight me, can you commit?

1090
00:53:26,257 --> 00:53:29,179
And so creating those kinds of informal coalitions

1091
00:53:29,219 --> 00:53:31,680
that will then have inertia to them in the late game

1092
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:33,400
can get around some of those problems.

1093
00:53:33,761 --> 00:53:35,481
You are still gonna get situations

1094
00:53:35,521 --> 00:53:37,162
where everyone is gonna gang up on the leader.

1095
00:53:37,242 --> 00:53:41,064
That's, for me, that's just a phase of the game.

1096
00:53:41,464 --> 00:53:43,885
So in En Route, the classic time this happens

1097
00:53:43,945 --> 00:53:45,586
is there are these dominance cards you can play

1098
00:53:45,886 --> 00:53:48,687
where you basically kick off your victory point marker

1099
00:53:48,707 --> 00:53:50,268
and you say, look, I'm gonna win the game

1100
00:53:50,648 --> 00:53:52,169
if I control this part of the map.

1101
00:53:53,072 --> 00:53:57,735
As soon as someone plays that, everyone is going to pile on you harder than at any time

1102
00:53:57,775 --> 00:53:58,315
other than the game.

1103
00:53:58,375 --> 00:54:03,959
It's going to be ridiculously unfair, which is why you have to plan and create a situation

1104
00:54:03,999 --> 00:54:07,521
where you know you're going to be able to withstand it.

1105
00:54:08,202 --> 00:54:12,584
The other thing, the more practical answer to your question is that I think strategic

1106
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:14,506
inertia is really important.

1107
00:54:15,366 --> 00:54:19,649
If players are going to lunge into you, it's going to do things to their late game.

1108
00:54:20,989 --> 00:54:22,831
if you are going, so like basically,

1109
00:54:23,111 --> 00:54:25,453
if you give people too much tactical flexibility,

1110
00:54:25,994 --> 00:54:27,075
then it's always going,

1111
00:54:27,315 --> 00:54:28,636
it's never gonna be able to tell a story

1112
00:54:28,676 --> 00:54:29,737
because it's always gonna feel

1113
00:54:30,137 --> 00:54:32,119
like there is no inertia to your own choices.

1114
00:54:32,459 --> 00:54:34,161
But if you give inertia to those choices,

1115
00:54:34,641 --> 00:54:36,143
then you can get around some of that problem.

1116
00:54:36,163 --> 00:54:36,803
Does that make sense?

1117
00:54:36,883 --> 00:54:37,764
Yeah, yeah.

1118
00:54:37,784 --> 00:54:39,125
Thanks a little bit of a scattered answer.

1119
00:54:39,145 --> 00:54:39,646
Sorry, go ahead.

1120
00:54:41,058 --> 00:54:42,539
Hi, I'm Chris Camisso.

1121
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:44,802
I go to school at the Rochester Institute of Technology

1122
00:54:45,102 --> 00:54:45,983
for Game Design Development.

1123
00:54:47,405 --> 00:54:49,968
I have a question about a board game I'm developing.

1124
00:54:50,408 --> 00:54:51,189
OK, hit me.

1125
00:54:51,249 --> 00:54:53,071
It's similar to Blood Bowl, and we

1126
00:54:53,091 --> 00:54:54,913
have a neutral piece, which is just a disc.

1127
00:54:54,953 --> 00:54:57,796
And it's basically Ultimate Frisbee with Death Gladiators.

1128
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:05,062
And we have, and I really don't know if it's a super issue, that's kind of what I was here to talk, ask about.

1129
00:55:06,363 --> 00:55:13,009
So we have several very legitimate kind of surrender board states, where if you've lost all of say X kind of piece,

1130
00:55:13,089 --> 00:55:17,813
it's a very good idea to just surrender, because the game will take another 10 minutes to end, and you're not going to win.

1131
00:55:17,913 --> 00:55:18,634
It's just not going to happen.

1132
00:55:20,335 --> 00:55:24,078
And so in that way, when the king is made, the game is kind of over.

1133
00:55:24,438 --> 00:55:31,623
And my question is, do you think that king-making has a space in a 1v1 strategy game kind of way?

1134
00:55:32,304 --> 00:55:41,010
And if so, how could I, in very gentle terms, if you can't really go into specifics, that's fine, because you don't have that much time.

1135
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:41,310
Sure.

1136
00:55:42,351 --> 00:55:45,393
Keep it so that the king doesn't just kind of cause the game to end.

1137
00:55:45,689 --> 00:55:49,110
Yeah, I mean, my general rule about this in my own practice is that games should be over

1138
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:53,532
the moment they're over, which is to say as soon as the thing is decided, the game should

1139
00:55:53,572 --> 00:55:55,532
organically come to a close pretty close.

1140
00:55:56,473 --> 00:56:02,135
So for instance, in the redesign of Pax Premier, the game I worked on about Afghanistan, as

1141
00:56:02,155 --> 00:56:06,256
soon as one player is ahead by four points, it's a pretty huge lead and the game is just

1142
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:06,576
over.

1143
00:56:06,636 --> 00:56:10,598
So there's this sudden death condition that even on the very first scoring round.

1144
00:56:11,407 --> 00:56:13,148
which is maybe 20 or 30 minutes into the game,

1145
00:56:13,468 --> 00:56:14,448
the game can be over.

1146
00:56:15,069 --> 00:56:18,551
And so I think, in the case of a two-player game,

1147
00:56:19,011 --> 00:56:21,332
you want to be as explicit and as formal

1148
00:56:21,432 --> 00:56:23,133
with those game end rules as possible

1149
00:56:23,193 --> 00:56:24,774
so that things don't drag out.

1150
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:27,396
And here, really good texts for you are

1151
00:56:28,196 --> 00:56:29,317
Twilight Struggle, obviously,

1152
00:56:29,397 --> 00:56:32,498
but then also Fort Sumter and 13 Days,

1153
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:35,260
which are just balanced on a knife's edge.

1154
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:36,541
And as soon as one player gets

1155
00:56:37,161 --> 00:56:39,343
gets ahead, the game shuts off,

1156
00:56:39,483 --> 00:56:41,004
so that you never have that tail end

1157
00:56:41,044 --> 00:56:42,405
where it's just kind of a formality.

1158
00:56:42,765 --> 00:56:44,947
Now, in a game that is modeling sports,

1159
00:56:44,987 --> 00:56:46,228
that can be a little tricky, right?

1160
00:56:46,548 --> 00:56:48,490
It depends on the sort of theming and what you're after.

1161
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:50,431
But I would say in general,

1162
00:56:50,812 --> 00:56:52,573
don't be afraid of sudden death conditions.

1163
00:56:52,633 --> 00:56:54,294
Just make sure, absolute sure,

1164
00:56:54,334 --> 00:56:56,176
that they are communicated to their players very clearly.

1165
00:56:56,196 --> 00:56:57,757
Okay, thank you. Thank you.

1166
00:57:04,152 --> 00:57:05,154
All right, cool, I'll repeat that here.

1167
00:57:05,174 --> 00:57:06,357
If other people have questions

1168
00:57:06,397 --> 00:57:08,142
or if you want to talk more about the Blood Bowl game,

1169
00:57:08,763 --> 00:57:10,949
I'll be in the wrap-up room on the other side of the hall.

1170
00:57:11,891 --> 00:57:12,432
All right, go ahead.

1171
00:57:12,472 --> 00:57:13,796
We've got time for a couple more questions.

1172
00:57:14,482 --> 00:57:15,562
Rick from the MIT Game Lab.

1173
00:57:16,042 --> 00:57:18,984
So I love DeKoven, and I actually wish more players

1174
00:57:19,224 --> 00:57:19,644
would read them.

1175
00:57:20,464 --> 00:57:21,965
I'm sorry, can you repeat that?

1176
00:57:22,525 --> 00:57:25,146
I love DeKoven's work, and I wish actually more players

1177
00:57:25,246 --> 00:57:27,727
could read them, to really understand how can we play

1178
00:57:27,767 --> 00:57:28,207
well together.

1179
00:57:28,227 --> 00:57:31,048
I'm wondering what do you think publishers could do to

1180
00:57:31,088 --> 00:57:33,249
encourage these kinds of game mechanics, or

1181
00:57:33,289 --> 00:57:34,050
even play communities?

1182
00:57:34,610 --> 00:57:41,298
Well, I feel like I'm able to get away with it, because I have never worked on a title

1183
00:57:41,318 --> 00:57:42,800
that's been meant for a general audience.

1184
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:48,928
I've been lucky to have a small core audience that I sort of got through Phil, the guy who

1185
00:57:48,948 --> 00:57:51,951
designed High Frontier, which I've been able to kind of borrow.

1186
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:55,154
And then even with my work at Leader Games,

1187
00:57:55,174 --> 00:57:56,935
like we have a core audience that sort of knows

1188
00:57:56,995 --> 00:57:58,196
the kind of work that we do.

1189
00:57:59,317 --> 00:58:02,679
Growing that audience takes titles like Root.

1190
00:58:03,019 --> 00:58:06,082
It essentially, you know, an existing audience

1191
00:58:06,322 --> 00:58:08,363
where you can get enough of that audience

1192
00:58:08,383 --> 00:58:10,245
to be playing that game and then encouraging people

1193
00:58:10,285 --> 00:58:12,506
who say, oh, well, I've never played a conflict game,

1194
00:58:12,546 --> 00:58:15,388
but I guess Root's doing well, I wanna try it out.

1195
00:58:15,468 --> 00:58:17,650
And like that's the moment when those audiences grow.

1196
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:19,912
So for a publisher it's difficult,

1197
00:58:19,952 --> 00:58:20,712
because I feel like the.

1198
00:58:21,752 --> 00:58:24,273
At least from my perspective, the main issue

1199
00:58:24,433 --> 00:58:26,354
when I have my publisher hat on is,

1200
00:58:27,235 --> 00:58:28,856
who's our audience and how can we serve them

1201
00:58:28,916 --> 00:58:29,596
really, really well?

1202
00:58:30,756 --> 00:58:33,258
And questions of audience expansion

1203
00:58:33,338 --> 00:58:34,578
are kind of secondary to that,

1204
00:58:35,038 --> 00:58:36,459
but ultimately I think the kind of thing

1205
00:58:36,479 --> 00:58:38,400
that you're talking about is finding ways

1206
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:39,621
to grow those audiences.

1207
00:58:40,361 --> 00:58:42,262
And my short answer to that is,

1208
00:58:42,422 --> 00:58:44,023
we just have to make the stories that the games

1209
00:58:44,063 --> 00:58:46,144
are telling so compelling that they can't be ignored.

1210
00:58:47,164 --> 00:58:47,444
Thank you.

1211
00:58:49,105 --> 00:58:49,925
All right, last question.

1212
00:58:51,188 --> 00:58:54,910
I'm Julian from the game Monster Prom from Barcelona.

1213
00:58:56,130 --> 00:58:59,993
The question I had, I found interesting what you said about the Battle Royale games

1214
00:59:00,573 --> 00:59:05,115
keeping losing players within the game thanks to emerging storytelling

1215
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:11,999
and how this is encouraged by, in this case, by being very multilateral.

1216
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:15,821
But if you have thought into this, what could you say?

1217
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:21,617
as they come to mind another potential building blocks

1218
00:59:21,677 --> 00:59:23,959
to create emerging storytelling on a video game

1219
00:59:24,579 --> 00:59:26,902
to keep the players even if they are losing.

1220
00:59:27,542 --> 00:59:30,465
So you're asking specifically how do we take

1221
00:59:30,485 --> 00:59:32,186
some of these lessons into the video game space?

1222
00:59:33,167 --> 00:59:34,849
It could be also for tabletop games.

1223
00:59:34,909 --> 00:59:37,471
It's like how you encourage this emerging storytelling

1224
00:59:37,511 --> 00:59:39,113
as a way of keeping engagement.

1225
00:59:39,431 --> 00:59:41,912
Yeah, so I think that in general, and we're just out of time,

1226
00:59:41,952 --> 00:59:44,552
but I have a short but I think good answer to this question,

1227
00:59:44,592 --> 00:59:47,733
which is to say what you're doing when you are doing game design

1228
00:59:47,773 --> 00:59:50,774
is you're giving players a language to exist in the world.

1229
00:59:51,294 --> 00:59:54,395
And you have to pay a lot of attention to how that language is built,

1230
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:56,275
because some languages are going to be quite restrictive

1231
00:59:56,715 --> 00:59:58,055
in the stories that you're allowing them to tell,

1232
00:59:58,115 --> 00:59:59,676
and other languages can be quite capacious.

1233
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:03,897
And I think a good example of this is something like Fantasy Flight's Netrunner.

1234
01:00:04,257 --> 01:00:05,397
When Netrunner first came out,

1235
01:00:05,877 --> 01:00:07,018
It was easy to make fun of the fact

1236
01:00:07,038 --> 01:00:08,519
that they were calling actions clicks

1237
01:00:08,579 --> 01:00:10,840
and they had invented this funny little dialect

1238
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:11,780
to talk about their game.

1239
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:15,442
But what it did is it immersed players in the world

1240
01:00:15,462 --> 01:00:17,043
so that even when you were talking about Netrunner,

1241
01:00:17,063 --> 01:00:18,303
you were still playing Netrunner.

1242
01:00:18,704 --> 01:00:21,345
And so I think from the design perspective,

1243
01:00:21,865 --> 01:00:25,147
give your players a language that is as expressive

1244
01:00:25,187 --> 01:00:27,768
as the game itself and really well-appointed

1245
01:00:27,808 --> 01:00:29,669
to talk about the world that you want them to exist in.

1246
01:00:29,689 --> 01:00:30,590
Okay, thank you very much.

1247
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:31,310
Thank you for that question.

1248
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:32,030
All right, and thank you guys

1249
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:33,251
for all the questions and for coming.
