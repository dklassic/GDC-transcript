1
00:00:03,922 --> 00:00:09,506
What really makes Fantastic Contraption work, the realization that if you can take an engine,

2
00:00:10,146 --> 00:00:16,050
you don't need to have a whole bunch of different tools like plungers and things that push back

3
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:16,510
and forth.

4
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:21,153
Specifically, you can make your own plungers and complicated tools out of these very simple

5
00:00:21,173 --> 00:00:21,733
building blocks.

6
00:00:22,434 --> 00:00:24,435
So this is the version that went out to friends and family.

7
00:00:24,815 --> 00:00:28,498
It worked probably just barely well enough to sustain that role.

8
00:00:31,038 --> 00:00:35,379
And if you look back, yeah, so it's got kind of all the major tools ended up in the final game.

9
00:00:35,919 --> 00:00:40,461
And so we can actually bring up some of the contraptions that they made.

10
00:00:44,282 --> 00:00:45,002
It's a... yeah.

11
00:00:46,383 --> 00:00:49,164
So we can actually look at some of the original contraptions.

12
00:00:52,445 --> 00:00:55,726
That this is... I think this is my brother's. This is the way he beat the level.

13
00:01:05,389 --> 00:01:06,750
And this is one of my friends.

14
00:01:12,312 --> 00:01:13,913
And this is my favorite. This is my dad's.

15
00:01:21,976 --> 00:01:23,936
Which I think he called the praying mantis.

16
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,782
And so right away, even with very simple tools and really early on in the design process,

17
00:01:30,802 --> 00:01:35,904
this is validating a lot of assumptions and we're also learning a lot about design.

18
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:40,886
There are things about how rods collide in this that didn't make it into the final design.

19
00:01:40,906 --> 00:01:45,728
There's a lot of things that changed from there to here, but overall you can see that the big stuff is working.

20
00:01:46,108 --> 00:01:50,990
Another really important thing to learn, that you get to learn by watching your users play the game,

21
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,472
is that, like I have these videos because they were really keen on sharing them.

22
00:01:56,012 --> 00:02:06,881
And so if people are playing your game and are really keen on sharing your videos, then you should probably make that part of your game, build that in, and then try to take advantage of it if you can.

23
00:02:07,402 --> 00:02:13,427
Alright, so this is the first version that has its art is a little bit better, but I think it's still my art.

24
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:18,291
And this is the first one with an actual win condition. It's the first one that says, oh my god, you won.

25
00:02:21,524 --> 00:02:28,568
After watching those previous plays, it became clear how people wanted to play the game and what the win condition would actually be.

26
00:02:29,068 --> 00:02:33,971
So beforehand, kind of the blurry eyed morning when I wrote that thing down, the initial thought was,

27
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:36,853
alright, well you build a thing and that entire thing will go from A to B.

28
00:02:37,493 --> 00:02:43,016
And so if I just sat down and cranked out the entire game and released it, that's probably what contraption would be like.

29
00:02:43,116 --> 00:02:48,780
But that isn't nearly as compelling as just getting kind of like just a bit of your contraption at the end.

30
00:02:49,504 --> 00:02:52,825
Other ideas bandied back and forth were just tagging it,

31
00:02:52,865 --> 00:02:57,246
like remember my dad's praying mantis just kind of tags the

32
00:02:57,286 --> 00:02:57,746
final goal.

33
00:02:58,266 --> 00:03:01,747
But that makes some designs a little too easy.

34
00:03:02,388 --> 00:03:09,230
So the final goal object piece worked really well and was a

35
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,150
direct outcome of playtesting.

36
00:03:15,512 --> 00:03:17,272
All right, so is this the Fusen?

37
00:03:20,405 --> 00:03:22,646
All right, so if Andy moves on to the next one.

38
00:03:28,787 --> 00:03:30,988
All right, so I want to show you something that, uh...

39
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:36,789
Man, we're having a lot of troubles today.

40
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,770
All right, well, I want to do, uh...

41
00:03:44,551 --> 00:03:45,611
I wanted to show you something...

42
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,733
I'm going to show you, well, I wanted to tell you about

43
00:03:48,773 --> 00:03:50,295
something that we tried that didn't work out.

44
00:03:50,735 --> 00:03:56,042
And so there's this idea that if you put rods into, so you

45
00:03:56,062 --> 00:03:57,083
build things with rods.

46
00:03:57,183 --> 00:03:58,705
And so rods kind of hold wheels together, and

47
00:03:58,725 --> 00:03:59,506
they form structures.

48
00:04:00,047 --> 00:04:01,369
And so if you

49
00:04:02,673 --> 00:04:03,653
Cross two rods.

50
00:04:04,073 --> 00:04:05,574
So sometimes you want to be able to cross rods,

51
00:04:05,634 --> 00:04:06,434
and sometimes you don't.

52
00:04:06,474 --> 00:04:07,595
You want to be able to build ramps

53
00:04:07,635 --> 00:04:08,655
that things can roll up on.

54
00:04:08,955 --> 00:04:11,436
But you also want to be able to build ceilings over things

55
00:04:11,476 --> 00:04:13,477
that hold balls up so things can run underneath them.

56
00:04:13,877 --> 00:04:16,738
So to do this, you have two kinds of rods,

57
00:04:16,818 --> 00:04:17,718
rods that pass through each other

58
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:18,898
and rods that don't pass through each other.

59
00:04:19,505 --> 00:04:20,626
So that's simple enough.

60
00:04:20,806 --> 00:04:24,510
But problematically, if you put two rods down

61
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,173
that can't pass through each other, what do you do?

62
00:04:27,293 --> 00:04:29,816
So what error do you show the user,

63
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,277
or what functionality do you have?

64
00:04:31,598 --> 00:04:35,602
So I really didn't want to show the user just a big red X

65
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:36,843
and tell them they couldn't draw anything.

66
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:40,647
So the original attempt was to actually fuse the rods

67
00:04:40,687 --> 00:04:40,988
together.

68
00:04:41,392 --> 00:04:49,054
So this is really good. I think this is a really good design decision to fuse the rods together instead of making them, forcing them not to be able to do it.

69
00:04:49,434 --> 00:04:55,336
Because it means you don't fail the user. You let the user just play the game like they want and something kind of natural occurs.

70
00:04:55,957 --> 00:05:02,179
If you're constantly fiddling with the user and telling them that they're doing something wrong, then they're immediately going to become perturbed with you.

71
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:04,059
So, eventually...

72
00:05:05,434 --> 00:05:09,918
So I did implement that and we tried it, but it just turns out to be way too good.

73
00:05:10,278 --> 00:05:14,761
These building games, a lot of the challenge is in building actual structures and saying,

74
00:05:15,102 --> 00:05:18,584
well if I want to go from, if I want to have an arm that reaches from here to here,

75
00:05:19,205 --> 00:05:23,188
there's some challenge in actually building the simple kind of set of triangles that can do that.

76
00:05:23,608 --> 00:05:27,652
And so if you fuse rods together, that becomes a trivial challenge.

77
00:05:31,695 --> 00:05:32,275
So here is

78
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:36,550
Here's another thing that drives me crazy.

79
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,411
So, oh, that's too, no, no, yeah.

80
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:42,611
Can you, wheels on rods?

81
00:05:46,352 --> 00:05:47,152
Yeah, so, sorry.

82
00:05:47,832 --> 00:05:50,053
This is something that is in the game as it is now,

83
00:05:50,113 --> 00:05:51,673
but this drives me totally crazy.

84
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,073
So Andy's gonna build a contraption for you,

85
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:58,674
and you'll see that it works non-deterministically.

86
00:05:58,754 --> 00:06:00,515
So when the user looks at this contraption,

87
00:06:00,535 --> 00:06:01,975
or if the user builds this contraption,

88
00:06:02,575 --> 00:06:02,775
then...

89
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,500
So, you have to build the, you have to put the water rods on the sides.

90
00:06:08,161 --> 00:06:11,021
When the user builds this contraption, then they won't be able to predict what's going to happen.

91
00:06:11,201 --> 00:06:17,103
And so, this is, this, this spent me, I lost a lot of sleepless nights over this problem.

92
00:06:17,483 --> 00:06:20,943
So, when you look at this, there's a couple sensible things I think that could happen.

93
00:06:21,044 --> 00:06:24,684
So, one of the sensible things is, they could both spin around in a circle, which would be great,

94
00:06:25,264 --> 00:06:29,665
or maybe neither of them spins around in a circle, but what actually happens is, if you hit play,

95
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:34,267
an arbitrary one of them spins around in a circle.

96
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,411
So that's some horrible game design right there.

97
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:44,052
But this is actually the shipped game,

98
00:06:44,072 --> 00:06:47,073
this is as it's playing on the web and on the iPhone

99
00:06:47,113 --> 00:06:47,393
right now.

100
00:06:48,353 --> 00:06:51,494
And I think the reason that this works,

101
00:06:51,654 --> 00:06:53,115
and I've never gotten a complaint over this,

102
00:06:53,175 --> 00:06:55,796
no one has ever mentioned this to me in our forums.

103
00:06:55,856 --> 00:06:57,096
Nobody has ever brought this up.

104
00:06:57,556 --> 00:06:59,897
And I think it's a really, it was a bit of an epiphany for me

105
00:06:59,997 --> 00:07:00,838
why this is fine.

106
00:07:01,758 --> 00:07:03,879
And I think it's all about mental models,

107
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:06,820
and that you don't, when you play a game.

108
00:07:07,634 --> 00:07:09,998
And when you view the world, you don't view it perfectly,

109
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:12,784
and you don't really think very hard about the physics that

110
00:07:12,824 --> 00:07:13,345
are going on.

111
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,810
So when people look at a wheel, they

112
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,756
don't think of it as having kind of a, like a.

113
00:07:19,156 --> 00:07:23,518
thing in the middle that produces torque around a beam, they think of it as something that

114
00:07:23,558 --> 00:07:29,060
spins. And so when people tend to not put beams in the middle of a wheel, because wheels

115
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,462
spin, wheels don't spin beams. Like cars go around, like wheels go around inside cars,

116
00:07:33,522 --> 00:07:38,023
cars don't go around outside of wheels. And so you can design to mental models instead

117
00:07:38,043 --> 00:07:43,346
of to the real world. And I think this is really successful in a lot of games in general,

118
00:07:43,406 --> 00:07:47,587
in places you might not think about it. Like in platformers, double jumping kind of feels

119
00:07:47,607 --> 00:07:48,948
like you should be able to jump, double jump.

120
00:07:49,362 --> 00:07:57,824
Like, I'm sure everyone when they were a kid, like, attempted to double jump, but it never

121
00:07:57,864 --> 00:07:58,464
really works.

122
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,324
And, like, wall running is the same thing.

123
00:08:00,525 --> 00:08:04,905
I'm sure, like, everyone here tried to wall run, but I'm sure we never made it past about

124
00:08:04,925 --> 00:08:05,245
a meter.

125
00:08:06,046 --> 00:08:11,607
And so mental models are powerful design tools because we can add great things to the world

126
00:08:11,747 --> 00:08:16,428
that make the game richer and simpler places, even if they don't exist in real life.

127
00:08:24,989 --> 00:08:25,949
You can just use the last one.

128
00:08:29,632 --> 00:08:29,913
All right.

129
00:08:29,973 --> 00:08:33,856
So I did a ton of user testing, and I think user testing is incredibly important.

130
00:08:35,658 --> 00:08:40,422
User testing early on helped build the game, and then later on at the end, there was a

131
00:08:40,462 --> 00:08:41,863
lot of work that went into the tutorial.

132
00:08:42,403 --> 00:08:44,825
So this is the original tutorial for Fantastic Contraption.

133
00:08:45,326 --> 00:08:46,567
The game is pretty much fleshed out.

134
00:08:46,587 --> 00:08:47,768
You know, all the art assets are there.

135
00:08:48,229 --> 00:08:51,851
Everything is working, it's fun, and all I have to do is teach people how to play.

136
00:08:51,871 --> 00:08:56,675
It's a fairly complicated game, but all you really need to know how to play is to build a simple car.

137
00:08:57,356 --> 00:09:01,939
And so this tutorial, with just several arrows and nothing is grayed out,

138
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,042
and I don't take anything away from you, is fantastic for gamers.

139
00:09:05,302 --> 00:09:09,385
Gamers totally love it, because gamers, they like to play, and they like to toy around,

140
00:09:09,405 --> 00:09:11,887
and they like to experiment, and they like to experiment playing games,

141
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:13,469
and they like to experiment learning games as well.

142
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:15,650
Unfortunately, none get...

143
00:09:16,151 --> 00:09:16,391
Sorry.

144
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:24,024
Unfortunately, non-gamers don't have that same safe feeling when they're using menu systems in learning games.

145
00:09:25,285 --> 00:09:32,691
I found that you have to teach people every button, what every button does, or they'll be afraid of touching it.

146
00:09:32,871 --> 00:09:38,456
And they won't fiddle with things. If something goes wrong, they're more likely to stop playing your game than to try to repair it themselves.

147
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:42,900
So, in this example, people would get here, and they would most likely...

148
00:09:43,997 --> 00:09:47,380
do that because it does technically fulfill the requirements.

149
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,603
Or, and if you hit go, you'll see nothing happens because it needs to be connected to

150
00:09:52,623 --> 00:09:54,364
the middle of the wheel to fix it.

151
00:09:54,484 --> 00:09:58,507
I mean, we could have added middle of the wheel to the help text, but that wouldn't

152
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,348
have, I'm sure that would have helped very little.

153
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:05,472
People would do this, and even though there's like an example right above showing what people

154
00:10:05,512 --> 00:10:07,553
should do, they rarely, if ever, would.

155
00:10:08,714 --> 00:10:12,056
So usually they get it wrong once, and then they would just stop playing the game.

156
00:10:12,677 --> 00:10:13,037
And that's

157
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:19,132
I think that's because people don't like to fail early, non-gamers like to be, have to

158
00:10:19,172 --> 00:10:22,854
be shown how to play your game really explicitly and they won't kind of discover how to play

159
00:10:22,894 --> 00:10:23,354
it on their own.

160
00:10:24,114 --> 00:10:34,098
So the tutorial that ended up in the actual game, which we can bring up separately, right?

161
00:10:35,998 --> 00:10:38,279
Anyway the tutorial that ended up in the actual game.

162
00:10:38,797 --> 00:10:45,343
After playtesting, if that one failed, it's kind of your typical tutorial that most games see.

163
00:10:46,204 --> 00:10:47,806
It's like a pop-up box that says,

164
00:10:47,906 --> 00:10:49,968
Okay, welcome to Fantastic Contraption.

165
00:10:50,268 --> 00:10:52,030
Press this button up here to select wheels.

166
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,072
Oh, good job, you selected wheels in the menu.

167
00:10:54,192 --> 00:10:56,935
Alright, press the mouse button down here to place a wheel.

168
00:10:56,975 --> 00:10:58,176
Oh, good job, you just placed a wheel.

169
00:10:58,756 --> 00:10:59,137
And then...

170
00:11:00,555 --> 00:11:04,537
It's completely awful for people like you and me, because there's constant mouse clicking,

171
00:11:05,277 --> 00:11:09,919
and all I want to do is play the game, and yeah, okay, I get it, a menu, you click on

172
00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:15,162
things in a menu to select them, that's totally amazing, and then please just let me play,

173
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:18,963
and if you fail here, which is where most people fail, it would just say, nope, wrong,

174
00:11:19,023 --> 00:11:23,185
try again, failed, you failed, you failed, until you get it right, in which case, hooray,

175
00:11:23,205 --> 00:11:25,146
you're rewarded with something actually working.

176
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:25,306
So.

177
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,580
That's, I mean, the importance of playtesting is that if I had

178
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,362
launched with that original tutorial, I would have gotten

179
00:11:34,422 --> 00:11:37,743
nearly the audience that the game actually reached in the

180
00:11:37,843 --> 00:11:51,587
end. All right. So I want to talk a little about a

181
00:11:51,767 --> 00:11:56,268
development. So I developed it in Flash, obviously, but I

182
00:11:56,288 --> 00:11:56,948
didn't use any

183
00:11:57,982 --> 00:12:02,704
But I didn't use the Flash authoring tool or any weird,

184
00:12:03,245 --> 00:12:04,385
funky Adobe tools.

185
00:12:04,465 --> 00:12:07,107
I just wrote it with a command line compiler

186
00:12:07,147 --> 00:12:10,229
and actually wrote contraption mostly in Notepad.

187
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:13,391
So don't be afraid of Flash.

188
00:12:14,011 --> 00:12:17,113
You can ignore the funky, bizarre features of it

189
00:12:17,533 --> 00:12:20,095
and just develop games like you develop games.

190
00:12:20,215 --> 00:12:22,336
Import assets just like you would normally import any

191
00:12:22,436 --> 00:12:22,836
assets.

192
00:12:24,938 --> 00:12:26,479
All right, Andy squished a couple bugs.

193
00:12:31,647 --> 00:12:35,849
Yeah, so I use Box2D to make Fantastic Interruption to handle all of the physics.

194
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,531
And I want to do a big shout out to Box2D and Aaron Kato,

195
00:12:38,971 --> 00:12:41,172
because that saved me a huge amount of time.

196
00:12:41,352 --> 00:12:44,234
If you kind of saw previously the amount of time Andy was squishing bugs,

197
00:12:44,294 --> 00:12:46,295
Box2D was much faster.

198
00:12:46,315 --> 00:12:49,777
And let me go from kind of one at a time squishing things to...

199
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:56,461
to really getting some work done.

200
00:12:57,561 --> 00:13:00,543
So Box2D I think of as the fire flower.

201
00:13:01,204 --> 00:13:08,108
of coding. Yeah, so finally we get to the release into the

202
00:13:08,148 --> 00:13:13,751
wild. And so, you know, I didn't know how well Fantastic

203
00:13:13,771 --> 00:13:18,614
Contraption would do. I made it mostly for me. And so when we

204
00:13:18,654 --> 00:13:21,256
finally released it, it was a soft launch so we could work out

205
00:13:21,296 --> 00:13:24,238
some of the bugs. It didn't go up on any portals, just on my

206
00:13:24,298 --> 00:13:26,719
site, and I think there was like two small blog posts.

207
00:13:27,344 --> 00:13:30,405
And then my wife and I kind of went away for the weekend.

208
00:13:30,545 --> 00:13:33,045
And when we got back, it turns out

209
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:35,686
that StumbleUpon had found us and dropped

210
00:13:36,706 --> 00:13:39,567
a horrifying crush of people onto the server.

211
00:13:42,067 --> 00:13:45,688
And so this is one of those good problems to have.

212
00:13:45,828 --> 00:13:47,308
But here's a secret.

213
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:48,549
There are no good problems to have.

214
00:13:48,569 --> 00:13:49,409
There are only problems.

215
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:53,650
And so this was hard for a lot of reasons.

216
00:13:57,961 --> 00:14:02,104
Not least because our server crashed immediately.

217
00:14:02,284 --> 00:14:05,686
And so the next several months and weeks were spent trying to

218
00:14:05,707 --> 00:14:06,827
keep the server up, which is hard.

219
00:14:06,907 --> 00:14:10,210
I recommend you have an upgrade path ready to go if you launch

220
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:13,412
a game with an important server component.

221
00:14:14,472 --> 00:14:18,175
And the other problem was that the forums we launched with the

222
00:14:18,215 --> 00:14:21,437
games were exploded with lots of people.

223
00:14:21,807 --> 00:14:24,068
And the forums were fantastic. They were really useful.

224
00:14:24,588 --> 00:14:27,008
There was what was going right with the game was in the forums.

225
00:14:27,048 --> 00:14:28,969
What was going wrong with the games was in the forums.

226
00:14:29,429 --> 00:14:33,389
But wandering into the forums myself was kind of a horrifying ordeal.

227
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:35,930
Because people who love the game and there are people who hate the game.

228
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,290
And there are people who love you and hate you,

229
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,291
even though they have never met you or know what you look like.

230
00:14:40,931 --> 00:14:43,951
And so the only way I got out of it was by...

231
00:14:44,011 --> 00:14:46,752
The only person Contraption ever actually hired was Andy Moore,

232
00:14:46,772 --> 00:14:47,892
his community manager, who...

233
00:14:50,552 --> 00:14:51,952
Got me out of this horrible mess.

234
00:15:04,117 --> 00:15:09,039
So, I mean, one of the reasons this went so well and there were so many people is because

235
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,360
Fantastic Contraption really lives online.

236
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,562
So, yeah, Andy, if you want to, like, bring up the game and we can look at, like, a save

237
00:15:16,602 --> 00:15:16,762
link.

238
00:15:17,722 --> 00:15:19,883
So, if you're playing Fantastic Contraption, you make a thing.

239
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:23,553
You're usually pretty chuffed about this thing you just built.

240
00:15:23,653 --> 00:15:26,375
I mean, it probably took you a while, and it was probably fairly hard to do.

241
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:30,736
And so when you finally did it, when you finally think, oh my god, I just have to get across

242
00:15:30,756 --> 00:15:39,600
that gap, I can't believe how long it's taking me, and you succeed, and you are prompted

243
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,080
to sign in.

244
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,530
I think we're having problems with the internet.

245
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:59,832
But whatever, after you log in, you save it, and that is saved on the server as your collection of contraptions.

246
00:16:00,512 --> 00:16:05,793
And then after you save it, you're presented with a URL, kind of the atomic unit of the internet.

247
00:16:06,093 --> 00:16:10,754
And if you sync this URL, it's very short, it just has contraption.com and a design ID.

248
00:16:11,174 --> 00:16:15,075
And if you paste that into any browsers, you'll get back to your contraption.

249
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:19,556
So you can send that to your friends, or you can send that on a forum, and the game suggests you do that.

250
00:16:21,044 --> 00:16:24,265
And when your friends click on that, they get to see your thing, which is great for you,

251
00:16:24,305 --> 00:16:27,207
because you get the pride of them seeing it, and it's great for me, because it means you're

252
00:16:27,227 --> 00:16:28,007
spreading the game around.

253
00:16:28,407 --> 00:16:31,149
Fantastic Contraption does really, really well on forums.

254
00:16:31,249 --> 00:16:36,411
My favorite thing is watching Contraption spread around on forums, because someone will

255
00:16:36,451 --> 00:16:38,012
find it, and they'll say, hey, I found this new game.

256
00:16:38,052 --> 00:16:39,333
It's called Fantastic Contraption.

257
00:16:39,973 --> 00:16:41,034
I've been playing it for a while.

258
00:16:41,314 --> 00:16:45,056
I'm kind of stuck on level six, but oh my god, level five was great, and here's where

259
00:16:45,096 --> 00:16:45,716
I built to do it.

260
00:16:46,096 --> 00:16:48,878
And someone will say, oh yeah, that is, that's a pretty neat thing.

261
00:16:48,998 --> 00:16:50,498
Oh, I beat level six, and I beat it like this.

262
00:16:51,228 --> 00:16:56,729
And so someone else will come around and say, oh, you know, I beat level 7 at like the same time, but I did it totally differently. I did it like this.

263
00:16:56,909 --> 00:16:58,930
And so it starts this real conversation.

264
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:03,591
And it's the entire board ends up getting swept into it.

265
00:17:03,932 --> 00:17:11,214
And just like Andy's getting swept up into his contraption now, people really enjoy it.

266
00:17:11,274 --> 00:17:11,714
And it works.

267
00:17:13,803 --> 00:17:19,707
It spreads, I'm not going to use the word virally, but it spreads in a communal kind of fun way

268
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:23,669
with none of the cynicism of those designed in viral loops.

269
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:30,613
It's just really people playing the game together and really enjoying what they've created and what their peers are creating.

270
00:17:33,795 --> 00:17:38,477
Yeah, so if we go back to the horrible Crusher people...

271
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:45,182
So here's my Google Analytics graph for if I can get past the

272
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:47,584
crush. Here's my Google Analytics graph for the first

273
00:17:47,624 --> 00:17:52,967
week, which went really well. All of the old indie game

274
00:17:52,987 --> 00:17:56,429
makers will tell you that it's really important to market your

275
00:17:56,449 --> 00:18:00,511
game really hard and develop press contacts. And I think

276
00:18:00,531 --> 00:18:04,614
that is really important. But I did almost none of that. So all

277
00:18:04,634 --> 00:18:05,775
of this growth is

278
00:18:06,177 --> 00:18:09,959
Basically thanks to StumbleUpon and we got a Jays Games review

279
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:14,202
early which did some fantastic things for us. But most of our

280
00:18:14,282 --> 00:18:18,104
traffic after the initial burst is, the vast majority of the

281
00:18:18,144 --> 00:18:22,747
traffic is all from those save links from outside on the

282
00:18:22,787 --> 00:18:26,429
greater internet. All right. So if we can continue on past the

283
00:18:26,469 --> 00:18:30,311
first week to the first month, things continue to go very well.

284
00:18:31,085 --> 00:18:37,106
One of the things I really like about the internet and that Fantastic Contraption is a great example of is that there are no gatekeepers.

285
00:18:37,646 --> 00:18:43,907
Contraption didn't go up on any portals and I didn't need Steam or Microsoft or anyone to tell me that I could do it.

286
00:18:44,307 --> 00:18:49,828
Fantastic Contraption just went up on my own website and it did really well on its own.

287
00:18:50,508 --> 00:18:56,429
There was no paid search, there was no publisher, no one told me I could do it. I just did it and it worked.

288
00:18:57,349 --> 00:18:59,430
I really love that model and I think...

289
00:19:00,312 --> 00:19:04,835
You know, people are chasing existing markets because I think that's an easier thing to do.

290
00:19:04,915 --> 00:19:09,177
And it's a valid approach. Like, Steam is doing really good things for Indie right now.

291
00:19:09,338 --> 00:19:16,041
But, you know, people sometimes, Steam says no to people, and sometimes all the gatekeepers say no to you.

292
00:19:16,102 --> 00:19:19,303
And I just, you know, I want to point out, and I think it's really important to think,

293
00:19:19,403 --> 00:19:24,326
that you don't, like, you really don't need anyone's permission to make a really good game and be successful making your game.

294
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:28,729
So the first month, traffic continues to go up. Pretty cheery about that.

295
00:19:30,048 --> 00:19:35,651
And at this point, money starts coming in, which is an

296
00:19:35,691 --> 00:19:38,252
incredibly emotional thing to happen.

297
00:19:38,432 --> 00:19:41,593
It's like, logically, money is good.

298
00:19:41,753 --> 00:19:45,095
But emotionally, it's much more powerful.

299
00:19:45,135 --> 00:19:48,737
Actually, my favorite part of the entire release of

300
00:19:48,777 --> 00:19:50,918
Fantastic Contraption, the most kind of emotional joy that

301
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:54,339
came to me, was when I was sitting at my really

302
00:19:54,379 --> 00:19:55,540
uninteresting job.

303
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,022
I used to do web dev and hack code for lawyer sites.

304
00:19:59,476 --> 00:20:03,339
And so I'd be like hacking some horrible like CSS problem

305
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:04,280
writing PHP.

306
00:20:04,841 --> 00:20:07,783
And a little email alert would come up

307
00:20:07,803 --> 00:20:09,365
that would say, ba-bing from PayPal,

308
00:20:09,605 --> 00:20:10,526
somebody has given you $10.

309
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,988
Some total stranger who you have never met

310
00:20:13,408 --> 00:20:16,291
likes your creation enough to pony up $10 of his own money

311
00:20:16,371 --> 00:20:17,292
just to you to play it.

312
00:20:17,912 --> 00:20:22,216
And it's an incredibly fantastic emotional rush

313
00:20:22,256 --> 00:20:25,719
to chase, especially when it's like entirely your creation.

314
00:20:26,273 --> 00:20:32,796
that you have gifted into the world, brought into the world, and it's fantastic when it

315
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:34,937
happens and is absolutely worth chasing.

316
00:20:37,538 --> 00:20:43,540
Yeah, so I want to talk as well about, right, so here's the big three months, kind of where

317
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,821
most of the traffic comes from.

318
00:20:44,861 --> 00:20:48,342
That spike in the middle is a big Reddit hit.

319
00:20:48,382 --> 00:20:51,183
We never got dug, but those traffic aggregators are...

320
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:55,787
Well, absolutely bread and butter for Fantastic Attraction, as well as, I'm sure, a lot of

321
00:20:55,807 --> 00:20:56,627
indie games.

322
00:20:57,788 --> 00:21:03,390
That's just kind of the aggregators, the way people use to find things are really important

323
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,690
when you're chasing down your own traffic.

324
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:09,932
And the internet, you can really do that because content discovery is kind of a solved problem,

325
00:21:10,032 --> 00:21:16,014
unlike even, you know, some, well, yeah, unlike the iPhone is pretty easy to enter, but its

326
00:21:16,054 --> 00:21:18,535
content discovery problems are pretty massive.

327
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:19,555
So...

328
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,043
The rest of this curve is pretty smooth.

329
00:21:24,763 --> 00:21:25,624
It's nice and fat.

330
00:21:25,664 --> 00:21:27,586
There's a fairly nice little tail to it.

331
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:29,247
A fairly nice tail to it.

332
00:21:29,828 --> 00:21:31,309
And everything continues to go well.

333
00:21:31,409 --> 00:21:35,452
So my conversion rate was about 0.5% of users.

334
00:21:35,933 --> 00:21:37,974
So that sounds really small, but when

335
00:21:37,994 --> 00:21:41,177
you're getting 3 million users, then that's still real money.

336
00:21:41,197 --> 00:21:44,019
So I'll do the simple math for you,

337
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:46,341
because last time I did this, some people got the math wrong.

338
00:21:46,902 --> 00:21:47,282
That's like $150,000.

339
00:21:47,342 --> 00:21:47,442
But.

340
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:53,030
This doesn't represent the game.

341
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,630
Eventually, it did go up on a couple of portals.

342
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,831
One up on Addicting Games, which has a ton of traffic,

343
00:21:57,672 --> 00:21:59,273
and as well as Congregate.

344
00:21:59,433 --> 00:22:01,574
And so that money isn't represented here.

345
00:22:01,674 --> 00:22:03,475
So contraption, the first three months, I think,

346
00:22:03,515 --> 00:22:05,956
made something on the order of $200,000.

347
00:22:06,156 --> 00:22:09,777
And then, obviously, the tail continues nicely as is.

348
00:22:11,258 --> 00:22:14,340
So after this, and Andy, maybe you

349
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,480
can just show us some contraptions.

350
00:22:16,761 --> 00:22:17,581
So after this.

351
00:22:18,934 --> 00:22:25,158
Remember this entire time I've got all these server woes and it's like an incredible pain in the ass to keep the server up.

352
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:30,462
So, when I really think about the launch of Fantastic Contraption, I think about making the game for four months,

353
00:22:30,502 --> 00:22:35,205
which was kind of arduous because it was kind of every waking moment because I was also working at a real job.

354
00:22:35,945 --> 00:22:36,906
Or, yeah, real.

355
00:22:39,204 --> 00:22:42,266
And then I launched the game and it immediately exploded.

356
00:22:42,326 --> 00:22:43,607
So I had server problems.

357
00:22:44,007 --> 00:22:47,009
And I got a little bit of money, which felt really nice,

358
00:22:47,209 --> 00:22:48,890
and some compliments, and some really good reviews,

359
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:49,710
which felt really good.

360
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,871
And then I spent the next four months

361
00:22:52,432 --> 00:22:55,894
arguing with servers, providers, and ISPs,

362
00:22:56,294 --> 00:22:57,254
and trying to keep the game up.

363
00:22:57,775 --> 00:23:01,136
So when I actually remember back to the contraption launch,

364
00:23:01,397 --> 00:23:04,198
it's not a very pleasant memory, because most of it

365
00:23:04,238 --> 00:23:04,919
is trying to keep it up.

366
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:07,720
So after I was successful.

367
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:15,498
talking to you. And money, somebody said that money is dumb and lonely and it just wants to

368
00:23:15,538 --> 00:23:23,483
be with other money. So after you start making a little bit of money, then all kinds of people

369
00:23:23,563 --> 00:23:31,288
with money will come to you. And most of them, I think Indies are incredibly wary of people that

370
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,109
come to them with deals.

371
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:37,722
Mostly, I think, because when people come to Indies with

372
00:23:37,762 --> 00:23:40,402
Deals, Indies end up with a really short end of the stake

373
00:23:40,482 --> 00:23:43,863
off of it. But I have had a really excellent experience

374
00:23:43,903 --> 00:23:46,863
working with a company named InXile in Southern California.

375
00:23:48,624 --> 00:23:53,445
They're writing Fantastic Contraption now, and so I made

376
00:23:53,485 --> 00:23:57,386
that decision because, for me, it was not very fun, much fun

377
00:23:57,406 --> 00:24:01,086
to run, so they run it. And I'm also not very interested in

378
00:24:01,147 --> 00:24:03,627
continuing to write contraption games. It was really fun to

379
00:24:03,647 --> 00:24:04,347
write the first time.

380
00:24:04,878 --> 00:24:10,059
But after a certain amount of writing code, I mean, I think

381
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:13,700
almost everybody loses interest in the game that they've been

382
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,360
working on for a certain amount of time.

383
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:20,501
I mean, there's no Braid 2 or World of Goo 2 in the IGF this

384
00:24:20,521 --> 00:24:20,722
year.

385
00:24:21,162 --> 00:24:23,882
And I think that's because we're creative people, and

386
00:24:23,902 --> 00:24:26,443
we're less interested in exploiting every cent out of

387
00:24:26,483 --> 00:24:30,043
something that succeeds as we are in expressing ourselves

388
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:30,523
creatively.

389
00:24:30,964 --> 00:24:34,307
So I'm a lot more interested in working on something else and I

390
00:24:34,327 --> 00:24:36,588
still want to get, you know, some cash out of Contraption 2

391
00:24:36,628 --> 00:24:40,851
so I'm going to let someone else take care of that. I found them

392
00:24:40,952 --> 00:24:46,916
kind of by kismet. They weren't coming to me to talk about

393
00:24:46,976 --> 00:24:49,778
working on Contraption. I kind of ended up talking to them

394
00:24:49,838 --> 00:24:53,881
about it first. But I had some really bad experiences before

395
00:24:53,921 --> 00:24:58,585
that and if you end up in this situation, which I hope you do

396
00:24:58,685 --> 00:25:00,386
because it's, I mean...

397
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:04,256
It's a pain in the ass, but it means that things are going

398
00:25:04,276 --> 00:25:07,938
well. There are some things you should really do. You have to

399
00:25:07,978 --> 00:25:11,399
close this information gap. So we know, kind of as indies, know

400
00:25:11,439 --> 00:25:13,900
very little about the business side of things. We don't really

401
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:18,082
know much about percentages and up front and royalties and what

402
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:20,463
right of first refusal really means and how dangerous it might

403
00:25:20,503 --> 00:25:20,623
be.

404
00:25:21,258 --> 00:25:26,880
And so you have to contact other indies, people like me and other people who are talking here

405
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,640
today, and you have to close that gap.

406
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,121
You have to find out what all this stuff is, what the standards are.

407
00:25:31,481 --> 00:25:36,023
People will come to you immediately, and I think the first offer I ever got, before Fantastic

408
00:25:36,043 --> 00:25:41,225
Contraption was ever launched, was somebody offered me $300 for the source code and all

409
00:25:41,265 --> 00:25:41,645
the rights.

410
00:25:43,765 --> 00:25:46,006
And it only got slightly better after release.

411
00:25:46,606 --> 00:25:47,026
And so...

412
00:25:47,657 --> 00:25:50,619
Really do your homework. That is like obviously an atrocious deal.

413
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:53,341
One of the things that would have kept me out of trouble is

414
00:25:54,162 --> 00:25:56,804
if you end up talking to someone, if you have a lunch meeting with them,

415
00:25:56,884 --> 00:26:00,627
do like a quick Google search, find out how many times they've been sued in the state of California.

416
00:26:01,648 --> 00:26:06,491
And if it's like more than two, then you might consider that heavily when you finally meet with them.

417
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:08,893
Yeah, so...

418
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:15,343
I think the slime, yeah, so I think the slime meter is a really important thing to take note of.

419
00:26:15,463 --> 00:26:19,567
If you're talking to someone over the phone and slime oozes out of the receiver on your end,

420
00:26:19,587 --> 00:26:27,114
then it's probably easier just not to work with them than to try to pick apart whether their deal is good and bad.

421
00:26:27,134 --> 00:26:32,680
If you don't trust someone, like, there are a million ways for them to screw you over and for them to beat you.

422
00:26:33,196 --> 00:26:35,157
So try to work with people you like, especially that

423
00:26:35,217 --> 00:26:36,437
are passionate about your game.

424
00:26:36,577 --> 00:26:38,738
People that actually play your game and converse about it

425
00:26:38,858 --> 00:26:42,540
can talk about your game like a peer

426
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,860
and like a fellow player would.

427
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,701
Because if they don't understand your game,

428
00:26:45,721 --> 00:26:46,741
then they'll never be able to make

429
00:26:46,761 --> 00:26:47,822
a decent version of your game.

430
00:26:48,182 --> 00:26:50,442
Also, obviously, look at things they've done before

431
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:53,924
and how well that did go or how well that didn't go.

432
00:26:53,944 --> 00:26:58,365
All right, I'd also like to mention

433
00:26:58,866 --> 00:27:00,706
I've been thinking a lot lately about.

434
00:27:01,894 --> 00:27:07,417
Kind of my perception of how well Fantastic Interaction went and why that went kind of a year ago,

435
00:27:07,437 --> 00:27:11,879
because it was released in 2008, and how my perception has changed this year.

436
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:14,120
So a year ago, if you'd asked me, I would have said,

437
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:19,823
oh yeah, Fantastic Interaction, write a game in Flash, make it better than your typical Flash game,

438
00:27:20,203 --> 00:27:24,705
release it, charge money for it, you win, stand up to applause, you're done.

439
00:27:26,306 --> 00:27:29,748
Since then, I've started to discover it's a little trickier than that.

440
00:27:30,165 --> 00:27:34,809
and that I think I've been thinking a lot about Machinarium, which is obviously a completely

441
00:27:34,829 --> 00:27:42,835
fantastic game. And I don't know, but Machinarium was obviously not released as like a flash

442
00:27:42,855 --> 00:27:48,420
game first. It was in Steam and for download for pay, and I think most people didn't know

443
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,240
it was a flash game.

444
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:56,158
And I think that was a good strategic decision because there are these odd kind of fallacy

445
00:27:56,318 --> 00:28:01,500
or odd ideas about flash games and how they should be free and how maybe you shouldn't

446
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:05,082
pay for them or they're not worth as much just because of what language they're written

447
00:28:05,122 --> 00:28:06,383
in which is obviously ridiculous.

448
00:28:07,163 --> 00:28:10,845
And I kind of a year ago thought that, well, okay, people don't really think that way.

449
00:28:10,905 --> 00:28:15,087
Contraption is an example of how that's garbage and you just need to write a decent game and

450
00:28:15,107 --> 00:28:15,747
people will buy it.

451
00:28:16,208 --> 00:28:17,588
But I think...

452
00:28:19,853 --> 00:28:24,235
Closer to why Contraption worked and perhaps other Flash games

453
00:28:24,315 --> 00:28:26,697
that are equally good or better than Fantastic Contraption

454
00:28:26,737 --> 00:28:29,738
haven't worked as well is because Contraption really

455
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,459
tries to live online.

456
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:34,921
Those saving links and the community features

457
00:28:35,121 --> 00:28:36,401
are really, really powerful.

458
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,623
And if I was going to write a game today,

459
00:28:38,643 --> 00:28:43,665
I am writing a game today, and it's continuing to be in Flash,

460
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:46,126
but it's not just a single player,

461
00:28:46,547 --> 00:28:48,688
like drop it in the water and watch it go experience.

462
00:28:49,175 --> 00:28:57,137
It's heavily using the internet and community features and publishing back and forth and talking with your friends.

463
00:28:57,257 --> 00:29:06,539
I think things like the rise of Twitter and Facebook, I think we should be looking really hard at ways of doing good things with those.

464
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:11,100
I was talking to a Facebook dev the other day and he was talking about how

465
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:20,282
Facebook developers kind of look at the entirety of Facebook and think they have to conquer it.

466
00:29:20,763 --> 00:29:27,687
And they have to draw in the wide swaths of Facebook and make it bow down to their will.

467
00:29:28,047 --> 00:29:30,669
But Facebook is huge. I'm sure everyone in this room has a Facebook account.

468
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,611
And very few of us play Farmville.

469
00:29:33,091 --> 00:29:38,074
And so I think it would be really nice to see some games for Facebook that we would play.

470
00:29:39,267 --> 00:29:42,709
There are like really great opportunities out there to use

471
00:29:42,829 --> 00:29:46,150
the kind of emerging social networks to do sensible things

472
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,871
instead of kind of really dumb games.

473
00:29:49,531 --> 00:29:50,532
That's a cool contraption.

474
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:56,574
All right.

475
00:29:57,074 --> 00:30:05,378
And so we'll wander back and oh no, escape Andy.

476
00:30:06,718 --> 00:30:07,018
Thank you.

477
00:30:09,572 --> 00:30:11,613
Alright, and we'll bump out into the credits.

478
00:30:11,693 --> 00:30:16,498
And I want to briefly, when you clap for me, I'd like you to clap for everyone who helped with this.

479
00:30:16,858 --> 00:30:17,779
Andy Moore is the puppeteer.

480
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:21,082
This entire thing was written in, all the parts that worked were written in.

481
00:30:21,342 --> 00:30:25,746
The broken parts were me, but the parts that worked were written by Eric Smith of the Citrus Engine,

482
00:30:25,766 --> 00:30:27,487
which is a nice little flash platforming engine.

483
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:30,370
Daniel Ben-Murgy, I know I'm pronouncing your name wrong,

484
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,452
did the character art for me and Andy the bad art.

485
00:30:32,652 --> 00:30:33,273
I actually did.

486
00:30:35,384 --> 00:30:39,086
But obviously the good art is really good. The animations, cheesy animations were me as well.

487
00:30:39,326 --> 00:30:43,209
And of course I can't help thanking Aaron Cotto over and over.

488
00:30:43,389 --> 00:30:44,970
Oh, one more last thing.

489
00:30:45,691 --> 00:30:50,113
If you do end up making some money, kick back some of it to the tool users that you created.

490
00:30:50,294 --> 00:30:54,857
I pushed back money for the first several months back to Aaron Cotto and the whole Box2D team,

491
00:30:55,357 --> 00:30:58,719
as well as money to the guys who ported it to AS2.

492
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:02,122
And that's the end of my post-mortem.

493
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,101
So I'm happy to field any questions.

494
00:31:13,161 --> 00:31:15,823
There's a microphone right there if anybody has any

495
00:31:15,843 --> 00:31:16,463
questions for me.

496
00:31:22,967 --> 00:31:24,648
I'll just do a filler question here.

497
00:31:24,888 --> 00:31:27,550
Do you have any interesting insights into Flash as the

498
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:30,092
platform other than the monetization question,

499
00:31:30,112 --> 00:31:31,633
technology otherwise?

500
00:31:32,533 --> 00:31:34,115
Sorry, I had problems understanding it.

501
00:31:34,955 --> 00:31:37,277
Flash as your development platform, good, bad?

502
00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:45,723
Yeah, so I think Flash, I think every platform has its place. I think it depends a lot on what kind of game you want to write.

503
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:56,467
If you want to write a game that really takes advantage of the internet and people can like share with each other and you know.

504
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:02,811
I think in a lot of ways the way you actually win in game development is to go into the

505
00:32:02,851 --> 00:32:03,351
wilderness.

506
00:32:03,851 --> 00:32:07,712
And so don't do what I'm telling you to do and don't do what anyone here is telling you

507
00:32:07,732 --> 00:32:10,953
to do because other people are already doing that and they're already trying that.

508
00:32:11,373 --> 00:32:15,835
What you should really do is find something that you think is going to work, an idea that

509
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:20,216
you have that other people maybe aren't having, and really try to own that and make that work.

510
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:25,965
It's hard for me to say Flash is good and download games are bad.

511
00:32:26,205 --> 00:32:28,066
Download games convert really well,

512
00:32:28,366 --> 00:32:32,169
and people make a living off of download games.

513
00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:34,850
And Flash games have the weakness

514
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:37,172
that single-player experiences in Flash

515
00:32:37,212 --> 00:32:38,793
probably don't convert as well.

516
00:32:40,194 --> 00:32:42,555
But you have big advantages if you're creative.

517
00:32:43,116 --> 00:32:45,457
And I think that's the real win of Flash.

518
00:32:52,205 --> 00:32:53,066
All right, more questions?

519
00:32:53,707 --> 00:32:56,189
Can you say something about how you got people

520
00:32:56,229 --> 00:32:58,771
to pay money for the game that was initially free to play

521
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:01,213
and how that design evolved and how that worked?

522
00:33:01,693 --> 00:33:03,975
Right, so Fantastic Entraption, you

523
00:33:03,995 --> 00:33:06,337
can play the first 20 levels for free,

524
00:33:06,717 --> 00:33:09,940
and then a level editor costs $10.

525
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,803
And so at the time, I thought it was really important

526
00:33:13,823 --> 00:33:16,065
to release a game that was.

527
00:33:19,351 --> 00:33:22,052
perceived as being free, even though it costs money.

528
00:33:22,512 --> 00:33:25,913
And so contraption reviews like that.

529
00:33:26,253 --> 00:33:27,894
If you look at reviews of Fantastic Entraption,

530
00:33:27,914 --> 00:33:30,255
you'll see that it's like a free-to-play game.

531
00:33:30,515 --> 00:33:33,316
And maybe there's a little extra stuff if you pay for it,

532
00:33:33,356 --> 00:33:35,056
but I'm not totally sure what it is.

533
00:33:35,657 --> 00:33:39,618
And so I think that's, obviously,

534
00:33:39,658 --> 00:33:41,278
that worked well for Fantastic Entraption.

535
00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:44,780
It's impossible to know if my conversion rate

536
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:50,442
would have been higher at the time, but I think now I'm thinking about moving paywalls

537
00:33:50,502 --> 00:33:51,463
up more aggressively.

538
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:55,364
There was about, I don't know, I say there was like 10 hours of free gameplay in Fantastic

539
00:33:55,384 --> 00:34:00,066
Contraption, but really I'm sure people played Contraption without paying any money for

540
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:00,907
hundreds of hours.

541
00:34:01,527 --> 00:34:04,908
And so, I mean, it's hard to know if that's a mistake or not.

542
00:34:04,968 --> 00:34:09,230
Now it feels a little like a mistake, and I'm not going to be doing, I'm not going

543
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,771
to be pushing that much free gameplay in the next versions.

544
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:19,915
Hi Colin, I'm Ryan from Untold Entertainment.

545
00:34:20,215 --> 00:34:20,575
Hey Ryan.

546
00:34:20,616 --> 00:34:21,156
Love your game.

547
00:34:21,516 --> 00:34:23,938
I was wondering, when you went with PayPal as your payment option,

548
00:34:24,218 --> 00:34:27,019
were you worried that you were leaving a big pile of money on the table

549
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,521
because PayPal doesn't cover everyone on the planet?

550
00:34:29,841 --> 00:34:32,083
This is a nice non-language based game.

551
00:34:32,643 --> 00:34:33,844
Yeah, I think...

552
00:34:34,484 --> 00:34:38,327
So, part of being like a real indie developer

553
00:34:38,747 --> 00:34:42,189
and doing it all yourself is you're wearing a lot of hats.

554
00:34:42,749 --> 00:34:43,150
And so...

555
00:34:44,054 --> 00:34:48,256
With Fantastic Contraption, the developer hat is fun to wear and the designer hat is

556
00:34:48,276 --> 00:34:51,477
fun to wear and the artist hat is not so much fun to wear.

557
00:34:51,598 --> 00:34:55,800
Oh yeah, all the art for Fantastic Contraption was done by my lovely wife, Sarah Northway.

558
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:06,826
I think a good solution that I can vouch for for getting art for your game is to marry

559
00:35:06,846 --> 00:35:07,226
an artist.

560
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:14,171
Kind of the server management hat and the monetization hat

561
00:35:14,491 --> 00:35:16,832
are not as interesting to wear.

562
00:35:16,992 --> 00:35:19,694
And I think a lot of indies have problems with that,

563
00:35:20,074 --> 00:35:22,095
and they'll kind of not as much interest

564
00:35:22,135 --> 00:35:24,036
in the business side of things and the monetization

565
00:35:24,076 --> 00:35:24,637
side of things.

566
00:35:26,938 --> 00:35:31,020
Certainly for me, PayPal was the easiest single thing

567
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,501
to implement and then kind of forget about it.

568
00:35:32,581 --> 00:35:36,284
You are absolutely on the nose in that I'm leaving

569
00:35:36,304 --> 00:35:37,184
a lot of money on the table.

570
00:35:37,892 --> 00:35:41,054
Something like 1% of Taiwan has played Fantastic Contraption.

571
00:35:41,074 --> 00:35:42,674
A huge number of people.

572
00:35:42,914 --> 00:35:47,016
And PayPal works really poorly in Taiwan.

573
00:35:47,076 --> 00:35:50,198
And so I didn't manage to monetize any of that traffic,

574
00:35:50,738 --> 00:35:52,819
which is just an absolute shame.

575
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,360
On the other hand, I know people in companies

576
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,362
that my wife implements payment methods professionally.

577
00:36:01,683 --> 00:36:02,503
Like, that's her job.

578
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:06,645
And I mean, that's like a never ending.

579
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:12,030
You could do that for your entire life. You could implement payment methods. So for me it was just

580
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:16,873
take, you know, the biggest, easiest implement one and forget about it. I think there are like

581
00:36:16,913 --> 00:36:24,398
interesting things going on now with the kind of the flash portals implementing like payment

582
00:36:24,418 --> 00:36:29,361
methods and like aggregating them as well as like other payment aggregators. And I think

583
00:36:29,381 --> 00:36:32,963
they're really worth looking at. I don't think I

584
00:36:33,552 --> 00:36:35,892
I really haven't, I don't know how compelling it is.

585
00:36:36,052 --> 00:36:38,193
So it's really easy math to do if you should use one of those

586
00:36:38,253 --> 00:36:40,154
or if you should just like be dumb and use PayPal, right?

587
00:36:40,514 --> 00:36:42,055
So PayPal takes on a $10 purchase,

588
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:44,555
they take like what, like 10% off the top, 10 or 15%

589
00:36:44,695 --> 00:36:47,777
depending on if it's like an American or foreign purchase.

590
00:36:48,317 --> 00:36:49,837
Oh, well, I'm Canadian,

591
00:36:49,857 --> 00:36:51,118
so I shouldn't really use the word foreign

592
00:36:51,158 --> 00:36:53,158
if it's an American or non-American purchase.

593
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,961
And so payment gateways often take like 30%.

594
00:36:57,802 --> 00:37:01,004
And so if you have to get 20% more traffic from them

595
00:37:01,044 --> 00:37:01,804
to make that worth it.

596
00:37:02,165 --> 00:37:04,426
And so I haven't seen any of them

597
00:37:04,466 --> 00:37:06,808
make a really compelling argument that that's true.

598
00:37:06,848 --> 00:37:08,629
If you ask them, they'll say, oh, yeah, absolutely.

599
00:37:08,669 --> 00:37:10,650
There's like slam dunk, no problem.

600
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:11,871
But it's hard.

601
00:37:11,891 --> 00:37:15,813
I mean, really, you need to have someone sell a game

602
00:37:15,853 --> 00:37:17,655
through PayPal and then say, oh, you know what?

603
00:37:17,675 --> 00:37:18,315
I'm not going to do that.

604
00:37:18,355 --> 00:37:19,736
I'm going to change to an aggregator

605
00:37:19,796 --> 00:37:21,257
and then see the numbers go up.

606
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,915
I would like to know if people shared more solutions or more levels?

607
00:37:25,935 --> 00:37:33,197
Because they could share both levels they made themselves or solutions.

608
00:37:45,145 --> 00:38:13,450
So, anybody, you don't have to pay any money to share solutions with each other. And if you buy the game, you get a level editor and you can build levels. And so, a shockingly few amount of people actually used the level editor. Andy, do you remember the... Right, so it was like under 5% of people who bought the game actually used and saved a significant, like more than one or two levels. And so,

609
00:38:15,139 --> 00:38:21,642
The level sharing was, uh, the level sharing didn't take, it wasn't nearly as valuable as the contraption sharing.

610
00:38:21,682 --> 00:38:24,064
I mean, uh, there's a couple of reasons for that, I think.

611
00:38:24,644 --> 00:38:29,966
Uh, one, the level creation is, uh, isn't as show-offy as building contraptions.

612
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:36,890
And people are, like, users are much more interested in showing off how smart they are than, um, how well they can design a level.

613
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:42,493
So if you look like, uh, yeah, if you look at this level, like, this is one of my levels, it's like, very simple.

614
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:44,588
It's just a bunch of stairs.

615
00:38:44,909 --> 00:38:47,731
And as a level designer, the idea

616
00:38:47,771 --> 00:38:49,031
behind my level design and contraption

617
00:38:49,091 --> 00:38:50,693
was to get out of the way as much as I can

618
00:38:50,733 --> 00:38:52,634
so that the user can have all the fun.

619
00:38:52,954 --> 00:38:54,575
Contraption is not about me being smart.

620
00:38:54,655 --> 00:38:55,696
It's about you being smart.

621
00:38:56,276 --> 00:39:00,179
And so when a good level is not about the designer looking

622
00:39:00,259 --> 00:39:02,321
smart, I mean, obviously, you have to be smart to make it

623
00:39:02,421 --> 00:39:05,683
look very simple and elegant.

624
00:39:06,203 --> 00:39:08,785
But when it's not obvious that you're being smart,

625
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:10,066
then people just don't really care.

626
00:39:10,466 --> 00:39:11,447
And so.

627
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:16,871
The levels people actually make end up being oddly overcomplicated and doing funny things

628
00:39:16,951 --> 00:39:18,152
and are very little fun to play.

629
00:39:18,312 --> 00:39:24,873
So I would say the level sharing was fairly uninteresting from a point both of levels

630
00:39:24,893 --> 00:39:27,774
that were created as well as traffic that it actually brought in.

631
00:39:30,755 --> 00:39:35,376
And I think that using users to actually make...

632
00:39:36,702 --> 00:39:41,704
We've experimented with having contests add levels to the games and trying to offload

633
00:39:41,724 --> 00:39:45,506
some of the level design jobs to users, which would be really nice to be able to do.

634
00:39:46,207 --> 00:39:50,049
But it turns out you spend a lot more time kind of digging through levels and tweaking

635
00:39:50,089 --> 00:39:56,232
levels and kind of doing editor work on levels that people submit.

636
00:39:56,852 --> 00:40:00,914
And in the end, it's probably better just writing your own content for yourself.

637
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:08,029
I was wondering, when you were showing those early prototypes

638
00:40:08,069 --> 00:40:10,890
to friends and family, if you were actively

639
00:40:11,191 --> 00:40:12,891
looking over their shoulder in the same room,

640
00:40:13,031 --> 00:40:14,892
or if it was just over the internet,

641
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:19,334
and what advice you can give for management kind of thing.

642
00:40:19,354 --> 00:40:19,674
Right.

643
00:40:19,694 --> 00:40:21,494
So that's an absolutely fantastic question.

644
00:40:21,634 --> 00:40:25,876
So that initial build you saw just went off

645
00:40:25,896 --> 00:40:28,017
to friends and family, and I didn't look over any shoulders.

646
00:40:28,037 --> 00:40:30,298
There was kind of a block of text explanation

647
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:30,958
that went along with it.

648
00:40:31,943 --> 00:40:35,444
I think friends and family are really bad at playing your game.

649
00:40:35,524 --> 00:40:37,905
Like, they'll say they love you at Christmas, but when it takes

650
00:40:37,925 --> 00:40:40,306
them playing your game for more than an hour, they won't do it

651
00:40:40,326 --> 00:40:42,407
unless it's actually a functioning, working game.

652
00:40:43,988 --> 00:40:48,509
And so, yeah, to answer the question you didn't ask, if

653
00:40:48,849 --> 00:40:50,870
your friends and family actually play it and enjoy it, it's

654
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:52,031
probably a good sign.

655
00:40:52,271 --> 00:40:54,311
And it's probably like you can take that as meaningful.

656
00:40:54,712 --> 00:40:57,233
They're not just like trying to make you feel good.

657
00:40:57,933 --> 00:40:59,453
And in terms of user testing,

658
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:05,181
I've done a ton of testing more recently for a game in the kind of contraption universe.

659
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:34,344
And it's kind of a lot more traditional puzzle game

660
00:41:34,404 --> 00:41:36,365
with kind of traditional answers and solutions.

661
00:41:36,826 --> 00:41:38,887
And so especially when you're not

662
00:41:38,928 --> 00:41:40,149
working with something as open-ended

663
00:41:40,209 --> 00:41:42,070
as Fantastic Interaction, user testing

664
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:45,033
is just unbelievably important.

665
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:48,856
I cannot stress enough how important user testing is.

666
00:41:49,601 --> 00:41:54,742
A puzzle may seem really easy to you and they may be completely impossible to the user.

667
00:41:55,342 --> 00:41:59,243
And you may be, okay, well, all I need to do is move the ball like four pixels to the

668
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:00,623
right and everything will be obvious.

669
00:42:01,203 --> 00:42:05,504
And that may be true, but by moving that thing four pixels to the right, you accomplish that

670
00:42:05,524 --> 00:42:08,165
goal and then lose them on something totally different.

671
00:42:08,585 --> 00:42:11,466
So you can never really make changes and then consider a level solved.

672
00:42:11,486 --> 00:42:16,847
You have to make changes, iterate, get somebody to test it, and then make changes and test,

673
00:42:16,887 --> 00:42:17,687
changes and test.

674
00:42:17,787 --> 00:42:18,887
And so you just have to run through.

675
00:42:19,357 --> 00:42:20,317
A lot of testers.

676
00:42:20,697 --> 00:42:23,878
And of course that's hard because you run out of people, especially in your target demographic.

677
00:42:23,898 --> 00:42:25,938
You get people who are too good at games or too bad at games.

678
00:42:26,618 --> 00:42:29,439
But yeah, the only way to do it is to just say nothing.

679
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:34,000
They'll turn to you and ask for help all the time and you just have to ignore them and

680
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,020
say no, I'm not going to help you.

681
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:39,641
Actually, one really good tactic that testers use is they'll start up a puzzle and they'll

682
00:42:39,681 --> 00:42:43,361
say they'll play at it for a while and then they'll go, oh man, all right, I give up.

683
00:42:43,942 --> 00:42:44,482
How do you do it?

684
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:46,182
And then you say, oh, what?

685
00:42:46,322 --> 00:42:47,142
I don't know.

686
00:42:47,222 --> 00:42:47,462
Maybe.

687
00:42:48,593 --> 00:42:49,854
I'm not going to tell you how to do it.

688
00:42:49,894 --> 00:42:50,834
It's like, that would be cheating.

689
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:53,096
And then they immediately go back to trying to solve it.

690
00:42:54,116 --> 00:42:56,818
Like it was their tactic to try to get through

691
00:42:56,878 --> 00:42:57,739
having to not solve it.

692
00:42:59,300 --> 00:42:59,640
Thank you.

693
00:43:02,041 --> 00:43:03,322
That kind of leads into my question here.

694
00:43:03,342 --> 00:43:06,244
I was wondering if you could go into your level design process

695
00:43:06,544 --> 00:43:09,706
and if you have a difficulty ramp,

696
00:43:09,766 --> 00:43:11,847
or did you just create a batch of levels

697
00:43:11,887 --> 00:43:14,589
and then some worked and some didn't through the testing?

698
00:43:15,049 --> 00:43:16,590
So definitely a combination of those.

699
00:43:18,282 --> 00:43:22,665
So the idea, the initial set of levels in Contraption was pretty

700
00:43:22,705 --> 00:43:24,927
easy to build, right? There's like the one where you go from

701
00:43:24,947 --> 00:43:26,748
left to right, and there's the one where you have to go over a

702
00:43:26,808 --> 00:43:28,610
thing, and then there's the one where you have to go from up to

703
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:31,091
down, and the one where you have to go from down to up, and the

704
00:43:31,172 --> 00:43:33,353
one where you have to drag something from over there. So

705
00:43:33,373 --> 00:43:37,376
they were all like very simple concepts that you just kind of

706
00:43:37,416 --> 00:43:41,760
like build through and then let play out. So I built up kind of

707
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,423
the obvious set of levels to begin with, and that was

708
00:43:47,219 --> 00:43:50,220
I think the obvious set was around 16 levels.

709
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:53,361
And then when you start putting testers through it,

710
00:43:54,022 --> 00:43:56,303
it kind of becomes clear that there are concepts

711
00:43:56,323 --> 00:43:57,243
that are going untaught.

712
00:43:57,803 --> 00:44:00,724
And so a lot of the times, those concepts

713
00:44:00,744 --> 00:44:05,086
that are going untaught also are really interesting early game

714
00:44:05,126 --> 00:44:05,446
levels.

715
00:44:05,606 --> 00:44:07,667
And so it's really hard for you to think of one

716
00:44:07,707 --> 00:44:11,549
of the really early levels is you just have to start.

717
00:44:11,989 --> 00:44:16,010
And can you go to the second level?

718
00:44:18,978 --> 00:44:19,678
Like rolling away.

719
00:44:21,179 --> 00:44:23,220
So rolling away is like the simplest level ever.

720
00:44:23,841 --> 00:44:25,942
And it's just kind of, if you make a ball,

721
00:44:25,962 --> 00:44:28,823
you just have to basically make a wheel in the right place.

722
00:44:28,903 --> 00:44:31,445
Like it is possible to fail, but it's not that easy.

723
00:44:31,945 --> 00:44:36,148
And so it became obvious that the users just

724
00:44:36,188 --> 00:44:40,050
had to have one more make a wheel level, where they knew

725
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:41,451
make it on the right is different from making

726
00:44:41,471 --> 00:44:41,951
it on the left.

727
00:44:41,991 --> 00:44:44,672
And how long that rod is has some impact

728
00:44:44,732 --> 00:44:47,934
on how successful your contraption is going to be.

729
00:44:48,355 --> 00:44:48,515
But.

730
00:44:49,261 --> 00:44:51,222
It ends up being a really interesting level

731
00:44:51,763 --> 00:44:54,165
to that level of user, like in the end anyway,

732
00:44:54,225 --> 00:44:56,606
because they're still getting to grips with all of that.

733
00:44:57,047 --> 00:45:00,289
So for Contraption, it was kind of obvious set of levels,

734
00:45:00,429 --> 00:45:02,491
play test it, discover things are going untaught,

735
00:45:02,891 --> 00:45:04,772
there are gaps in the learning curve,

736
00:45:05,193 --> 00:45:08,875
and then just patch those up with levels as needed.

737
00:45:14,108 --> 00:45:22,091
Was there any particular reason why you chose not to use the Flash IDE and use the different set of development tools like the notepad and whatnot?

738
00:45:22,571 --> 00:45:31,154
Yeah, so I'm just a programmer and I'm used to writing Java code and C++ code.

739
00:45:31,614 --> 00:45:37,195
And so I was a lot less interested in learning to use a new tool than I was into actually making a game.

740
00:45:37,575 --> 00:45:43,237
Actually, this is something that I think a lot of people who start out making games

741
00:45:44,921 --> 00:45:50,606
up, kind of getting bogged down in details and filling out tools for themselves and worrying

742
00:45:50,646 --> 00:45:54,589
about technologies when if they just kind of like sat down and started writing the game

743
00:45:54,609 --> 00:46:01,475
then they'd actually finish it. People who work with me kind of are driven crazy by the

744
00:46:01,515 --> 00:46:05,878
whole, like, I use Notepad and a command line compiler because...

745
00:46:07,194 --> 00:46:08,635
It's like an inefficient way to do things.

746
00:46:08,695 --> 00:46:10,916
And I finally started using FlashDevelop,

747
00:46:10,956 --> 00:46:13,558
which is much better than a command line

748
00:46:13,578 --> 00:46:15,078
and text files.

749
00:46:15,579 --> 00:46:19,721
But I'm really uninterested in spending any amount of time

750
00:46:19,821 --> 00:46:22,982
on something that isn't actually actively writing a video game,

751
00:46:23,503 --> 00:46:26,264
which I think is a strength, but can also sometimes be

752
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:26,644
a weakness.

753
00:46:27,685 --> 00:46:28,065
Thank you.

754
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:34,288
All right, I think we have five minutes.

755
00:46:34,328 --> 00:46:35,809
We have time enough for one more question.

756
00:46:40,225 --> 00:46:40,365
No?

757
00:46:42,109 --> 00:46:42,990
All right, should I just end it?

758
00:46:44,173 --> 00:46:45,094
All right, thanks very much.
