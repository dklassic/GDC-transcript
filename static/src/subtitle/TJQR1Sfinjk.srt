1
00:00:08,292 --> 00:00:11,174
Hello everyone, this feels very much like I'm back in school.

2
00:00:12,854 --> 00:00:15,135
If you want to push up, please do.

3
00:00:16,536 --> 00:00:23,439
So today I'm going to talk about my journey from a modder and a real non-gamer to being

4
00:00:23,459 --> 00:00:24,880
creative director on PUBG.

5
00:00:25,782 --> 00:00:27,922
This is not a technical track.

6
00:00:28,002 --> 00:00:31,324
This is more kind of my personal story over the last

7
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:34,585
four years and how I ended up being here and

8
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:35,325
talking to you guys.

9
00:00:36,005 --> 00:00:39,086
I was quite nervous about doing this because, as I said,

10
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:40,407
it's not a very technical track.

11
00:00:40,447 --> 00:00:42,207
I'm not going to be able to tell you how to scale to 3

12
00:00:42,728 --> 00:00:44,388
million CCU.

13
00:00:44,428 --> 00:00:46,709
That's way out of my field of expertise.

14
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:50,190
We have wizards back in Korea to do that, and hopefully

15
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,831
they'll be able to come and talk someday to you guys.

16
00:00:53,591 --> 00:00:53,711
So.

17
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,111
So I started in Brazil.

18
00:00:58,672 --> 00:01:03,856
I was there for about six years total, living, working mainly

19
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:06,758
as a photographer, sometimes as a DJ.

20
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:12,362
And I really like photography in general,

21
00:01:12,402 --> 00:01:14,143
because it captures an experience.

22
00:01:14,163 --> 00:01:15,284
It captures a moment.

23
00:01:15,304 --> 00:01:16,765
And it's something I've done most of my life.

24
00:01:18,326 --> 00:01:24,190
I was also a designer doing flyers, photography for bands,

25
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:31,452
other graphic design work. This really helped me coming into gaming as well because as a modder

26
00:01:32,653 --> 00:01:38,815
I had to do a lot of the stuff myself from the art for the game to how it was perceived by the

27
00:01:38,835 --> 00:01:46,559
general public. Most of my photography was kind of rock event photography, candid photography.

28
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:54,102
As I said I loved capturing a moment, something in time that people can look back at and talk about

29
00:01:55,178 --> 00:02:01,080
That's kind of why I like games like DayZ so much,

30
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,341
because they kind of create that water cooler moment.

31
00:02:04,401 --> 00:02:06,882
Same with PUBG, that I meet fans and they

32
00:02:06,962 --> 00:02:10,263
talk about the moment they had with their friends.

33
00:02:11,123 --> 00:02:13,924
And in photography, I really like capturing moments

34
00:02:13,944 --> 00:02:16,405
like that and then having friends look back at a photo

35
00:02:16,445 --> 00:02:17,966
and go, oh, I remember this.

36
00:02:20,087 --> 00:02:21,587
So speaking about DayZ, my

37
00:02:24,315 --> 00:02:32,917
gaming history, so to speak, is not huge. As I said, I'm not a massive gamer. I was very much like I,

38
00:02:33,317 --> 00:02:40,380
growing up, I gamed a little. My first experience in multiplayer was on Telnet using MUDs with a

39
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,541
friend in college. After that, I played, of course, some of the AAA titles like COD and Assassin's

40
00:02:46,581 --> 00:02:48,562
Creed, but my first kind of...

41
00:02:49,684 --> 00:02:53,567
love on multiplayer gaming and my first experience with sort of large-scale

42
00:02:53,587 --> 00:03:00,012
multiplayer gaming was at Delta Force Blackhawk Down. I loved this game. It was,

43
00:03:00,933 --> 00:03:04,155
you know, it was a realistic simulation. The single-player was good, but really it

44
00:03:04,195 --> 00:03:07,237
was multiplayer that really pulled me in, you know.

45
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:11,064
There were so many different maps created by the community,

46
00:03:11,084 --> 00:03:14,007
there were different game modes around those maps,

47
00:03:14,307 --> 00:03:16,930
and there was such a depth of gameplay available.

48
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,792
And it had realistic ballistics,

49
00:03:19,932 --> 00:03:24,637
and it simulated a real world, or so I thought.

50
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:29,521
And I loved that, and I played so many hours of this game.

51
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:31,443
And really, like looking back now and reflecting

52
00:03:31,483 --> 00:03:33,044
when writing talks like this is...

53
00:03:35,295 --> 00:03:38,698
you know, really heavily affected me as to what I like in games.

54
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,723
Then the servers kind of died in that and I found America's Army 2.

55
00:03:44,003 --> 00:03:46,585
And again, at this stage I wasn't really gaming a whole lot.

56
00:03:46,665 --> 00:03:50,849
I would be working on design or photography and coming home at night

57
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:52,090
and maybe playing a few hours.

58
00:03:53,131 --> 00:03:57,394
And America's Army 2, it really, again, looking back,

59
00:03:57,614 --> 00:03:58,835
I love that type of game.

60
00:03:58,875 --> 00:03:59,936
It was your...

61
00:04:00,922 --> 00:04:02,283
your mistakes had consequences.

62
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:04,024
If you did something stupid, you died.

63
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,345
And I like that.

64
00:04:05,385 --> 00:04:07,487
I like when a game punishes you as a player,

65
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:10,469
because if you're not punished, you won't learn,

66
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:12,090
and you won't become better at the game.

67
00:04:13,852 --> 00:04:16,394
The idea that you died at the middle of a round,

68
00:04:16,414 --> 00:04:17,294
and then you couldn't play, and you

69
00:04:17,314 --> 00:04:19,576
had to watch your teammates, I really liked that.

70
00:04:19,616 --> 00:04:21,778
It was punishing me and making me learn.

71
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:28,783
So Battle Royale, why I'm here today.

72
00:04:30,746 --> 00:04:39,317
I was sort of saving to come home in Brazil at the time, and I had sort of discovered

73
00:04:39,337 --> 00:04:40,198
the DayZ mod.

74
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:46,946
I think I saw a Reddit thread on it or something, and found it, found Arma 2, and started playing

75
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:47,727
the DayZ mod.

76
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,172
Again, talking about these kind of experiences in gaming,

77
00:04:51,232 --> 00:04:54,795
I remember very clearly the first time one of our clan

78
00:04:54,855 --> 00:04:58,538
got the helicopter on Stiliski Island and flew it to us.

79
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:01,280
And there was this real tension and nervousness

80
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,083
that some other squad would come and wipe us out

81
00:05:04,123 --> 00:05:05,344
before we got in the helicopter.

82
00:05:05,604 --> 00:05:07,105
And those kind of moments,

83
00:05:07,205 --> 00:05:11,068
I fell in love with that sort of open world game.

84
00:05:11,088 --> 00:05:12,369
It drew me back to gaming.

85
00:05:12,429 --> 00:05:14,931
A lot of the AAA titles, and especially story-driven ones,

86
00:05:15,572 --> 00:05:15,932
they didn't...

87
00:05:16,731 --> 00:05:19,213
deliver what I wanted from a game, which was kind of freedom.

88
00:05:19,493 --> 00:05:24,577
And DayZ really opened up that sort of idea that here's a world,

89
00:05:24,917 --> 00:05:26,818
there's a set of rules, go and survive.

90
00:05:26,838 --> 00:05:29,120
You know, there's no rules to it.

91
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:30,982
Well, there are rules, but you know what I mean.

92
00:05:31,002 --> 00:05:34,124
It's the gameplay is invented by you rather than the game.

93
00:05:34,844 --> 00:05:37,767
So this concept I fell in love with.

94
00:05:38,027 --> 00:05:43,571
I ran a DayZ mod server for about six months, a year.

95
00:05:43,591 --> 00:05:45,332
There's a guy called Devil Walker.

96
00:05:47,048 --> 00:05:51,069
He offered me, he said, listen, I'll buy a server if you want to add some scripts in.

97
00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:53,350
And we did and we kind of built up a community.

98
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:57,552
And, you know, we talked with the community and figured out what they wanted from the

99
00:05:57,592 --> 00:05:58,512
DayZ server.

100
00:05:58,632 --> 00:06:04,415
And it ended up being very much a PvP game rather than a survival game.

101
00:06:04,495 --> 00:06:05,895
So we upped the loot rates.

102
00:06:05,975 --> 00:06:09,537
We just experimented with, you know, how the gameplay.

103
00:06:11,392 --> 00:06:15,035
happened on the server. As I said, it was centered around PvP and it was my first

104
00:06:15,415 --> 00:06:20,618
kind of experience into game making and level design and you can see in the

105
00:06:20,658 --> 00:06:25,481
background there there's some like of the locations I kind of put in to

106
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:29,584
increase where people got weapons, increase hot spots around the map and

107
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:33,786
try to differentiate our DayZ server from the many others.

108
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,864
I created this thing called the Arena, which was again an attempt at level design, an attempt

109
00:06:40,884 --> 00:06:43,926
to create a space that we could put players against each other.

110
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:51,392
It wasn't hugely popular, but it was me trying to figure out ways to make every match unique,

111
00:06:51,472 --> 00:06:53,974
every situation, and just pit players against each other.

112
00:06:56,176 --> 00:06:59,478
So out of that came DayZ Battle Royale.

113
00:06:59,838 --> 00:07:02,000
This was my first experience in trying to...

114
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,251
be the game master and trying to create this game.

115
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:12,975
I had seen the Survivor Games, an event by Brian Hicks and Jordan Thayer, hugely popular

116
00:07:13,275 --> 00:07:17,177
and a wonderful riff on the Hunger Games but in the DayZ mod.

117
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:21,520
It was streamer only and I wanted to play and I wasn't a streamer so I saw some of the

118
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,400
stuff they were doing.

119
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:24,749
I thought I could do it better.

120
00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:26,871
You know, the ever-decreasing circle,

121
00:07:26,891 --> 00:07:29,272
instead of having a game master decide where the circle was,

122
00:07:29,332 --> 00:07:31,073
you know, these kind of things that you

123
00:07:31,093 --> 00:07:33,395
were fighting against the computer when it

124
00:07:33,455 --> 00:07:36,957
came to the game mode itself.

125
00:07:37,137 --> 00:07:41,160
I liked what they did, but as I said,

126
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,801
I thought I could do it a little bit better.

127
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:45,102
And Battle Royale was born out of that.

128
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:49,262
It was me making a game that I wanted to play with my friends.

129
00:07:50,343 --> 00:07:53,568
I released it, some teaser images as you can see there, on Reddit.

130
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:55,430
It was kind of...

131
00:07:56,091 --> 00:08:00,317
It was received quite well and when we launched the servers we

132
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,018
really had...

133
00:08:02,866 --> 00:08:05,028
Oh, you know, a crazy influx of players.

134
00:08:05,628 --> 00:08:08,890
I would see the game chat when we launched Battle Royale,

135
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:12,533
and people would be saying I was trying to get into these servers for two days.

136
00:08:12,613 --> 00:08:15,975
Now, at the time we had six servers, you know, there weren't many games,

137
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,917
and I had to restart servers all by myself.

138
00:08:19,017 --> 00:08:21,319
The first two or three days I didn't really sleep,

139
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:25,061
because there was no code there to shut down and restart the server.

140
00:08:25,081 --> 00:08:28,103
Eventually, Bohemia did add it to the core code in ARMA,

141
00:08:28,143 --> 00:08:30,685
so now you can do that, but at the time I had to...

142
00:08:31,393 --> 00:08:36,256
you know, beg and borrow people to, you know, write systems that would do this,

143
00:08:36,276 --> 00:08:39,537
because I'm not a technical person, I don't know how to do this.

144
00:08:39,597 --> 00:08:43,359
Even the code for the original, you know, Daisy-Bout-Royale mod,

145
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:47,701
you know, I spent a month writing a timer, you know, just a timer that would just

146
00:08:47,741 --> 00:08:51,002
time everything in the game. And this is like very basic code, but, you know, it

147
00:08:51,042 --> 00:08:53,663
took me that time to figure out how to do it and get it to work

148
00:08:54,464 --> 00:08:56,204
in the sort of the ecosystem of Arma.

149
00:08:57,846 --> 00:09:01,547
So I believed that building up a lore behind the game

150
00:09:01,587 --> 00:09:04,228
would also help people sort of buy into it.

151
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:07,850
These are kind of early kind of photographs

152
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:12,212
I'd publish on via my Twitter or post to social.

153
00:09:13,012 --> 00:09:14,853
The one up on the top, you see one

154
00:09:14,873 --> 00:09:17,534
of the very first airdrops, I guess, in Battle Royale

155
00:09:17,634 --> 00:09:19,574
was when we were testing and getting these photos.

156
00:09:20,115 --> 00:09:22,035
Originally, it was started like the Hunger Games.

157
00:09:22,415 --> 00:09:24,536
You have the round circle of.

158
00:09:25,557 --> 00:09:28,817
where everyone would start, and a cornucopia in the center.

159
00:09:29,237 --> 00:09:31,618
You know, this was why in Battlegrounds,

160
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:35,158
the very first alpha test, we ran people out of a building

161
00:09:35,218 --> 00:09:38,819
because it was harping back to what we'd done in Arma 2,

162
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,420
Battle Royale, just to see if it worked.

163
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,420
Eventually, we chucked people out of a plane,

164
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,380
and it's a much better way of doing things.

165
00:09:45,821 --> 00:09:48,761
This was the original map for Battlegrounds,

166
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:49,741
or for Battle Royale.

167
00:09:52,274 --> 00:09:54,836
You can see all the systems there, the blue zone, red zone,

168
00:09:55,176 --> 00:09:57,518
and there's the start position where everyone ran from.

169
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,122
I was really, you know, we did Daisy Battle Royale

170
00:10:03,182 --> 00:10:05,784
for about, I'd say about three months, four months total.

171
00:10:06,685 --> 00:10:08,206
The Daisy standalone came out

172
00:10:09,046 --> 00:10:10,588
and kind of tore players away from us.

173
00:10:10,968 --> 00:10:12,889
But that really kind of gave us the chance

174
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:17,513
to move to Arma 3 and pair down to the Battle Royale game,

175
00:10:17,553 --> 00:10:18,733
what everyone kind of knows today.

176
00:10:20,595 --> 00:10:23,479
DayZ Battle Royale was fun for me though because we had zombies.

177
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,941
It was DayZ, right?

178
00:10:26,937 --> 00:10:31,499
I had so much fun spawning, you know, we were coming up with ideas for hordes of zombies

179
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:35,201
and really like a PvE battle royale as well as PvP.

180
00:10:35,741 --> 00:10:39,403
If you were outside the zone in those days, we just spawned zombies around you, so you'd

181
00:10:39,443 --> 00:10:43,365
see people running into the zone with a trail of zombies, which was great fun.

182
00:10:44,546 --> 00:10:48,768
But I added way too many, because I just, you know, I liked that intensity.

183
00:10:48,808 --> 00:10:54,351
It's what I loved about DayZ in those early days was that the PvE was like really...

184
00:10:55,597 --> 00:11:00,440
hard, you know, that you you it was a challenge and I like that in the game

185
00:11:00,501 --> 00:11:03,803
I like dying in games because you know, you want to go back and beat it

186
00:11:06,544 --> 00:11:08,105
So, I know it's a double slide sorry

187
00:11:09,967 --> 00:11:14,029
So Arma 3 battle royale, this is again, so people had moved to Daisy

188
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:19,332
the standalone and I decided Arma had come out of alpha and

189
00:11:20,518 --> 00:11:23,985
I wanted to pare it down, get rid of the PvE elements, well apart from the red zone,

190
00:11:24,345 --> 00:11:28,072
and really pare down what Battle Royale was as a game mode.

191
00:11:33,745 --> 00:11:38,406
over its life of about, it's still going today, you know, but at its peak we were getting

192
00:11:39,246 --> 00:11:44,788
what about a hundred or a thousand CCU, which for a small mod was, was, we were happy with,

193
00:11:44,848 --> 00:11:49,090
you know, we were getting tens of thousands of players every day and, and, you know,

194
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,970
we really had a very strong community.

195
00:11:52,243 --> 00:11:57,309
You know, I've built a team over the last three years that now they handle pretty much everything

196
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:02,035
to do with the mod from adding new maps, to adding new content, to making changes and

197
00:12:02,475 --> 00:12:08,983
you know they have the same passion for just making a really super simulated battle royale in Arma 3.

198
00:12:11,518 --> 00:12:15,381
You know, over the years, the community, and it's something we continued into PUBG, was

199
00:12:15,881 --> 00:12:19,784
we really wanted to, like, involve the community because they're the ones that play your game

200
00:12:19,844 --> 00:12:22,246
and getting feedback from them is so important.

201
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:27,605
In the early days, when I first came to ARMA,

202
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:30,428
if you have never gone into the ARMA modding community,

203
00:12:30,688 --> 00:12:32,350
I really strongly suggest you do.

204
00:12:34,092 --> 00:12:38,257
There's such a wealth of content and ideas and scripts

205
00:12:38,597 --> 00:12:40,799
and just people playing with the ARMA engine.

206
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:49,115
I say to anyone that wants to create a 3D shooter, e-game or anything with a realistic

207
00:12:49,155 --> 00:12:55,480
world, try your idea in Arma, try your idea as a mod for something because there's a huge

208
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,221
player base out there.

209
00:12:56,241 --> 00:13:00,004
There's still hundreds of thousands of people that play Arma on a daily basis.

210
00:13:01,745 --> 00:13:05,608
there's people there to play your idea and it really allows you to iterate

211
00:13:05,648 --> 00:13:07,529
quite quickly because the content is already there and

212
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:11,012
and trust me there is such a massive amount of content and armor

213
00:13:11,672 --> 00:13:14,775
you know you'll be spoiled for ideas. So again

214
00:13:15,455 --> 00:13:18,598
coming back to Battle Royale I was really trying to pare down the idea that

215
00:13:18,618 --> 00:13:22,360
this was a random fight. It was

216
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:23,862
designed to

217
00:13:25,876 --> 00:13:29,779
test a player in a moment rather than by a knowledge of a game.

218
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:34,003
I had moved back to Ireland. I was in my parents' house

219
00:13:34,363 --> 00:13:38,026
in kind of an office. This was my battle station at the time,

220
00:13:38,326 --> 00:13:42,110
which PC Gamer did a feature on which embarrassed the fuck out of me.

221
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:46,073
But at this time I was still making the mod.

222
00:13:46,713 --> 00:13:47,654
I'd moved back to Ireland.

223
00:13:49,123 --> 00:13:50,485
My parents were asking me what was I doing.

224
00:13:50,565 --> 00:13:52,446
I was making a mod on Arma 3.

225
00:13:52,846 --> 00:13:55,408
I wasn't making money from it, but I had belief that this

226
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,809
could be something great.

227
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,051
They didn't understand that.

228
00:13:59,691 --> 00:14:00,892
They were like, would you not think?

229
00:14:01,313 --> 00:14:02,614
Because I was in my mid-30s.

230
00:14:02,874 --> 00:14:03,735
I didn't have a career.

231
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:06,356
I was a photographer and a designer, essentially out of

232
00:14:06,397 --> 00:14:09,399
work, because as a freelance designer and photographer in

233
00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:11,560
your 30s in Ireland, it's tough to enter a market.

234
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,162
I'd been out for six years.

235
00:14:13,682 --> 00:14:15,744
So I was doing this in the hope that

236
00:14:15,784 --> 00:14:16,444
something would happen.

237
00:14:18,955 --> 00:14:22,038
There's some things I'm very proud of in the...

238
00:14:22,438 --> 00:14:23,159
Why is this not playing?

239
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,941
Ah, there we go.

240
00:14:26,802 --> 00:14:27,642
No? Ah.

241
00:14:27,983 --> 00:14:30,084
So this is the loot system in Arma 3.

242
00:14:30,445 --> 00:14:33,407
So this is showing you how high and low density loot

243
00:14:33,587 --> 00:14:38,331
is spread around the map over the course of many rounds.

244
00:14:38,371 --> 00:14:39,392
Obviously, you guys know this.

245
00:14:41,874 --> 00:14:43,798
I'm really happy with how it works.

246
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,603
You know, we spent a long time trying to figure it out.

247
00:14:45,623 --> 00:14:46,745
It's a very basic system.

248
00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:48,129
You know, there's high tier and low tier loops.

249
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,113
Then there's high tier and low tier areas.

250
00:14:53,032 --> 00:14:56,013
It just gives the feeling every time that it's a random game.

251
00:14:56,073 --> 00:14:59,814
You know, I would watch Twitch streamers talking about the

252
00:14:59,834 --> 00:15:02,415
loot system in Arma 3, about how we change stuff.

253
00:15:02,575 --> 00:15:06,056
And I can tell you in about the two years that the Arma 3

254
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:09,317
model has been popular, we haven't really changed the

255
00:15:09,337 --> 00:15:10,418
loot system all that much.

256
00:15:10,478 --> 00:15:12,759
You know, we might change it maybe once every six months,

257
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,159
but really it doesn't change.

258
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:17,160
But the way it works, it delivers that kind of

259
00:15:20,477 --> 00:15:23,098
feeling of newness every game.

260
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,860
Praise Orange Jesus.

261
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,202
You know this is something I very much espouse is like

262
00:15:32,603 --> 00:15:36,584
I'm very careful I talk with our design team who are great and sometimes it's

263
00:15:36,925 --> 00:15:36,945
a

264
00:15:38,007 --> 00:15:42,513
It's hard for me because I really try to get the idea that you shouldn't design the game.

265
00:15:42,953 --> 00:15:45,636
You should just create the system and let people play it.

266
00:15:45,857 --> 00:15:51,063
With new modes, it's like, we just adapt the systems we have and make new modes, but let

267
00:15:51,123 --> 00:15:56,369
the players come up with the actual gameplay because they're so inventive.

268
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:01,033
and some of the ways they choose to play a game is nothing you can plan.

269
00:16:01,153 --> 00:16:05,997
And, you know, I'm very careful about designing the game too definitely.

270
00:16:06,658 --> 00:16:11,142
So leaving it, like, I love that emergent gameplay. I know it's a buzzword, but, you know,

271
00:16:11,182 --> 00:16:15,025
Daisy showed me, like, listen, any story can be the story you want, you know,

272
00:16:15,085 --> 00:16:17,487
that you can tell your story and designing these...

273
00:16:18,368 --> 00:16:20,669
open world survival PvP games.

274
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:24,131
It's having these games that generate these water cooler moments,

275
00:16:25,272 --> 00:16:27,714
you know, is something I love that we're able to do these days.

276
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:32,797
In ARMA 3 I reiterate it a lot, I love our game modes.

277
00:16:32,857 --> 00:16:37,240
With our event servers in PUBG it's kind of expanding on this idea that,

278
00:16:37,641 --> 00:16:40,282
you know, we have many ideas for new game modes and

279
00:16:40,643 --> 00:16:41,923
we have a lot of stuff internally.

280
00:16:42,244 --> 00:16:46,246
I have history in ARMA 3 that, you know, it's just a great

281
00:16:48,372 --> 00:16:52,313
thing to be able to play in and provide new experiences for our players and we

282
00:16:52,353 --> 00:16:55,674
want to do that with with our event server. I did Street Fight which was

283
00:16:55,714 --> 00:17:00,856
based you know Altus it's 20 kilometers by 20 kilometers it's a massive map in

284
00:17:00,956 --> 00:17:04,897
Arma and it gave me so many different cities that you could just focus a battle

285
00:17:04,937 --> 00:17:11,339
royale in that city with pistols you know so fun and just a different spin on

286
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,359
the battle royale game mode.

287
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,171
just using and abusing the arsenal in Arma.

288
00:17:19,211 --> 00:17:22,652
They had tanks and rocket launchers and heavy artillery.

289
00:17:22,692 --> 00:17:24,993
And why not have a battle royale like that?

290
00:17:25,053 --> 00:17:26,873
Because it wasn't done at the time.

291
00:17:26,953 --> 00:17:28,634
And I thought, OK, let's play with it.

292
00:17:29,294 --> 00:17:33,515
So at the time, we were still getting 1,000 CCU in Arma

293
00:17:33,675 --> 00:17:34,536
at this stage.

294
00:17:35,756 --> 00:17:36,496
And I was quite happy.

295
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:40,538
But again, I was kind of looking for a way to make my own game.

296
00:17:41,772 --> 00:17:44,253
there was nothing out there for me at the time.

297
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:46,754
I tried to look into Unreal.

298
00:17:46,814 --> 00:17:50,216
I tried to look at making Battle Royale as a standalone game.

299
00:17:50,276 --> 00:17:52,797
I'd reached out to Bohemia, and they were just

300
00:17:52,837 --> 00:17:55,679
busy with DayZ and Arma that they didn't have time.

301
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:59,260
So at this stage, not I had given up,

302
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,441
but I was really kind of wondering what would happen.

303
00:18:03,022 --> 00:18:03,863
Then H1 happened.

304
00:18:06,644 --> 00:18:09,866
So I'm really, I say I'm the luckiest man in gaming.

305
00:18:11,122 --> 00:18:12,463
And this is part of this, you know.

306
00:18:13,544 --> 00:18:17,148
They had mentioned in some of their Dev Talks

307
00:18:17,228 --> 00:18:19,770
that they liked what I'd done in Arma 3.

308
00:18:20,751 --> 00:18:23,494
And I thought that was great.

309
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:24,695
Thanks for mentioning me.

310
00:18:24,936 --> 00:18:25,456
You want to help?

311
00:18:26,517 --> 00:18:28,940
And sure enough, John Smedley sent me a DM saying,

312
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,241
hi, I'm John.

313
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:32,303
Let's talk.

314
00:18:33,052 --> 00:18:38,598
I didn't sleep that night, and the next day he rang me and he offered, let's come to San

315
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:42,862
Diego and talk about adding and licensing the Battle Royale game mode into H1.

316
00:18:43,263 --> 00:18:46,927
And the rest, you know, kind of is history, right?

317
00:18:46,987 --> 00:18:53,434
It sort of helped cement the Battle Royale game mode as a new sub-genre, right?

318
00:18:54,577 --> 00:18:57,239
H1 really got it in front of a lot more eyeballs.

319
00:18:57,999 --> 00:18:59,060
They did some great things.

320
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,062
I saw the first Invitational.

321
00:19:02,102 --> 00:19:04,124
It really kind of showed off what

322
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,985
Battle Royale e-sports could be.

323
00:19:07,066 --> 00:19:08,467
I was there in TwitchCon.

324
00:19:10,565 --> 00:19:17,467
there were queues of people every day to try to qualify for the finals and we had I think about

325
00:19:18,387 --> 00:19:22,849
2,000 people in the auditorium and a lot of people online watching and that for me was the first

326
00:19:22,889 --> 00:19:28,190
sign okay it's what I always thought when I started this that battle royale could be an

327
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:35,273
amazing new e-sport and a spectator sport that has spectacle right and seeing this it was the

328
00:19:35,313 --> 00:19:37,473
first kind of sign of that and I was really hopeful but

329
00:19:38,642 --> 00:19:44,685
You know, they wanted to go a more kind of simpler route than the battle royale I wanted.

330
00:19:45,365 --> 00:19:49,467
So you know, I let them do their own thing with H1 and I moved back to Arma 3.

331
00:19:50,727 --> 00:19:57,911
So again, going on the idea that I wanted to create more and more spins on battle royale

332
00:19:57,951 --> 00:20:00,772
because modding allows you to do that very, very easily.

333
00:20:02,573 --> 00:20:04,014
I teamed up with the Ironfront team.

334
00:20:04,074 --> 00:20:05,375
And this again, this is why I love modding, right?

335
00:20:05,395 --> 00:20:05,815
It's so much fun.

336
00:20:05,835 --> 00:20:06,255
It's so much fun.

337
00:20:06,315 --> 00:20:07,776
It's so much fun.

338
00:20:08,888 --> 00:20:12,250
Iron Front the game, you know, is an oldish game.

339
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:15,512
And the Arma 3 engine is a great engine.

340
00:20:15,872 --> 00:20:18,093
And the two teams kind of synced up,

341
00:20:18,253 --> 00:20:20,595
and the company gave the Arma 3 modding team

342
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:22,636
the assets to use, or permission to use the assets,

343
00:20:22,976 --> 00:20:26,038
so they could spin up Iron Front inside Arma 3

344
00:20:26,198 --> 00:20:27,819
with the, you know, advanced ballistics

345
00:20:27,879 --> 00:20:29,040
and this kind of stuff.

346
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,401
So, you know, I love that about modding of this,

347
00:20:31,461 --> 00:20:34,123
like this older game is now getting rebirth in,

348
00:20:37,325 --> 00:20:40,589
So I teamed up with the Iron Front because who doesn't want a World War II Battle Royale?

349
00:20:40,749 --> 00:20:43,432
And I decided, right, let's see if we could do it.

350
00:20:44,233 --> 00:20:45,635
This was the trailer we made for...

351
00:21:16,787 --> 00:21:18,408
So, yeah, so that's our In Front Battle Royale.

352
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:20,750
And this was all, the video was edited by me.

353
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:23,832
We, you know, we set up a server to record all this.

354
00:21:24,552 --> 00:21:28,975
But, you know, all the stuff I had done from graphic design to, I was a video editor for

355
00:21:29,015 --> 00:21:33,878
photography, it all kind of, you know, it was all helping create these mods and create

356
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,920
these mods with this kind of produced stuff.

357
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,961
So it looked like, okay, this is something serious.

358
00:21:38,879 --> 00:21:42,180
So H1Z1 released King of the Kill,

359
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,920
or split the games into King of the Kill and Just Survive.

360
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,161
And I got an email from C.H. Kim.

361
00:21:49,321 --> 00:21:49,501
Nope.

362
00:21:49,521 --> 00:21:52,081
There we go.

363
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:52,762
Right.

364
00:21:54,602 --> 00:21:57,942
So I got an email from C.H. Kim from Bluehole saying,

365
00:21:58,043 --> 00:22:01,163
hi, I'm a Korean producer,

366
00:22:01,303 --> 00:22:04,544
and I've wanted to make a Battle Royale game

367
00:22:04,704 --> 00:22:05,824
for about 10 years now.

368
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:14,996
I've seen what you've done, I love what H1 have done, would you be interested in coming and talking to us about making a game with us?

369
00:22:16,888 --> 00:22:20,771
I had looked into Bluehole and they were an MMO company so obviously I had reservations

370
00:22:20,851 --> 00:22:22,472
but I flew to Korea.

371
00:22:23,653 --> 00:22:28,818
I met Mr. Kim, or Dr. Kim should I say, and Sammy.

372
00:22:29,738 --> 00:22:34,182
It was snowy February and it was wonderful.

373
00:22:34,963 --> 00:22:37,645
I went to Bluehole and it was like a very big family.

374
00:22:38,786 --> 00:22:44,070
They all have this passion for making well-made games and from the very start we went.

375
00:22:45,957 --> 00:22:47,420
We drank with a big black bar.

376
00:22:48,301 --> 00:22:49,483
I thought this was a glitch earlier.

377
00:22:49,964 --> 00:22:50,965
But this is us drinking.

378
00:22:53,429 --> 00:22:55,372
So we went drinking.

379
00:22:55,412 --> 00:22:57,676
We went talking about what we wanted to accomplish together.

380
00:22:57,716 --> 00:22:58,777
And the more I talked with

381
00:23:00,557 --> 00:23:05,643
CH, the more I discovered that what he wanted for a game was very much what I wanted.

382
00:23:05,663 --> 00:23:14,071
This platform for a great battle royale game and more than that, the idea of modding, the

383
00:23:14,132 --> 00:23:18,076
idea of working with the community and being very open in development.

384
00:23:19,377 --> 00:23:21,860
So I decided very quickly to work with Bluehole.

385
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,921
I moved out.

386
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:31,893
I think about two weeks later, the day before my 40th birthday, we started working on Battlegrounds.

387
00:23:32,733 --> 00:23:38,796
You know, it was very, it was crazy in that sort of early days of development, because

388
00:23:38,816 --> 00:23:43,238
we were pushing hard, you know, we initially wanted to release in about, I think about

389
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:47,940
nine months, and there was a lot of effort from the team, you know, there was a lot of

390
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,502
long days, and it wasn't because we wanted people to work, it was like we all believed

391
00:23:52,562 --> 00:23:53,982
those early kind of playtests.

392
00:23:55,425 --> 00:23:59,151
those early iterations on the idea,

393
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:02,435
it was already generating fun within the company.

394
00:24:02,796 --> 00:24:03,637
I remember seeing...

395
00:24:05,742 --> 00:24:10,004
when I went to H1, the first time we got a playable battle royale in the game,

396
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:14,827
you know, you had these old devs, you know, of like, you know, veteran devs

397
00:24:15,207 --> 00:24:19,109
that were having fun and shouting and screaming at each other and just enjoying the game.

398
00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:22,490
And it was the same when we came to Bluehole, those first iterations that we had,

399
00:24:22,951 --> 00:24:26,432
you know, the team, they would gather behind each other, you know, they would,

400
00:24:28,253 --> 00:24:28,453
you know,

401
00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:33,951
look at, you know, cheer on the one winning. It was just a wonderful experience, and it's still to this day, you know,

402
00:24:33,971 --> 00:24:37,393
if we're playing playtests internally, whoever's winning, there's a group of people watching them.

403
00:24:37,473 --> 00:24:43,057
It's a real kind of family atmosphere in the company, and it's something I'm very, I feel very lucky to have found them.

404
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:44,098
So,

405
00:24:45,178 --> 00:24:50,862
we worked hard that first year. Lots of meetings. The team started quite small, you know, we could fit in one room.

406
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,331
Now we need a very big room.

407
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:57,852
But this was my first view really into game development.

408
00:24:58,792 --> 00:25:04,713
With H1, I was not stand-off, but I got to spend very little time in Santa Monica.

409
00:25:05,174 --> 00:25:10,695
Here I was living and breathing with the dev team and figuring out and finding out how games are made,

410
00:25:10,735 --> 00:25:14,236
which most of you guys know, I'm sure, but for me this was all new.

411
00:25:16,662 --> 00:25:20,944
I didn't realize the complications, you know, that I would suggest stuff that we'd like

412
00:25:21,044 --> 00:25:26,227
and sometimes the tech director would look at me quite maddeningly, but other times he

413
00:25:26,247 --> 00:25:27,567
just slapped me down and go, no.

414
00:25:28,968 --> 00:25:32,090
And it comes from my lack of understanding of the engine and lack of understanding of

415
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,050
what's actually possible.

416
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,991
So we had many, many meetings.

417
00:25:36,522 --> 00:25:40,524
We, and again, you know, but it was, it was wonderful to see that someone would crack

418
00:25:40,564 --> 00:25:45,507
something or someone would do something new and the team would just, you know, celebrate

419
00:25:45,527 --> 00:25:45,567
it.

420
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:49,089
It's, it was a very kind of horizontal structure and it's a credit to.

421
00:25:50,755 --> 00:25:58,043
the man there, Mr. Kim. He's built such an amazing team. When we started we were about

422
00:25:58,463 --> 00:26:06,852
30 strong and these were people he had worked with for years, people he had built up great

423
00:26:06,892 --> 00:26:07,513
friendships with.

424
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:11,923
They really, kind of that first six months,

425
00:26:12,183 --> 00:26:14,024
there were, as I said, there were only about 30 of us

426
00:26:14,064 --> 00:26:15,964
and we worked hard, you know?

427
00:26:16,024 --> 00:26:19,385
It was, we really had this kind of very specific vision

428
00:26:19,485 --> 00:26:20,986
for what we wanted for a game.

429
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:24,967
And there were lots of arguments about, you know,

430
00:26:25,047 --> 00:26:26,788
how it could go forward or what we should add

431
00:26:26,808 --> 00:26:27,768
and what we should not add.

432
00:26:27,788 --> 00:26:31,449
And I was very, you know, hesitant to change

433
00:26:31,509 --> 00:26:33,770
the core game mode because, you know, I thought,

434
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:35,410
okay, this has worked for so long in Arma.

435
00:26:36,341 --> 00:26:39,083
I don't want to add too many things to it because I don't want to overcomplicate it.

436
00:26:39,103 --> 00:26:43,845
It was one of the questions I got very much from the early days was, you know, what makes

437
00:26:43,966 --> 00:26:45,526
Euro Battle Royale different?

438
00:26:46,007 --> 00:26:50,189
I didn't want to be different, I just wanted to be good and the good version of what I

439
00:26:50,249 --> 00:26:52,491
wanted to make.

440
00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:57,634
So we had lots of disagreements and lots of arguments, but really it made the team stronger

441
00:26:57,914 --> 00:27:04,157
and we grew very close and everyone understood the vision and it really helped me this year

442
00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:08,980
you stick your name on a game, you have to do traveling to promote the game.

443
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:13,142
And I was all over the world at conventions, meeting fans and doing press.

444
00:27:13,222 --> 00:27:15,442
So, you know, I don't get a lot of time to spend with the dev team.

445
00:27:15,482 --> 00:27:17,543
And I'm very much, I like being there.

446
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:22,185
I like being in person and talking to people rather than writing long and complicated design documents.

447
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:26,266
Because, well, you know, who likes writing those?

448
00:27:26,806 --> 00:27:31,308
So doing a lot of traveling and having that trust in the team that they could...

449
00:27:33,496 --> 00:27:35,957
do the vision, you know, they could create the vision.

450
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:39,720
Again, it's a credit to CH for building that kind of team,

451
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,002
that just understand what we're doing,

452
00:27:42,062 --> 00:27:43,724
rather than what I'm doing.

453
00:27:44,864 --> 00:27:47,406
So, we had a very agile system of development.

454
00:27:47,907 --> 00:27:49,988
It works great, especially the way that we set it up.

455
00:27:50,008 --> 00:27:53,091
But CH is agile, not agile.

456
00:27:53,491 --> 00:27:54,352
It worked really well.

457
00:27:54,412 --> 00:27:56,914
We, you know, every day, every month,

458
00:27:56,954 --> 00:27:59,236
we would have meetings to talk about,

459
00:28:00,917 --> 00:28:01,237
you know, how...

460
00:28:02,836 --> 00:28:07,298
you know, what new features were added, as I said, it was a horizontal structure, so we had,

461
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:11,240
you know, people suggested new things, they could take ownership of that, and

462
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:16,062
it just, you know, the revive system, jumping out of the, giving people the choice to jump out of

463
00:28:16,082 --> 00:28:21,324
the plane, these were all things that came internally, and were sort of approved by the

464
00:28:21,344 --> 00:28:26,607
team in general, so it was, it was great to see that the game mode grow with the input of, you

465
00:28:26,647 --> 00:28:29,368
know, all these developers who, who just love making games.

466
00:28:31,889 --> 00:28:35,031
We also did a lot of everything internally.

467
00:28:35,491 --> 00:28:36,612
Again, we were a small team.

468
00:28:36,652 --> 00:28:39,234
We didn't have AV teams to support us.

469
00:28:39,535 --> 00:28:42,437
And we recorded dev blogs.

470
00:28:42,557 --> 00:28:44,939
And it's something we did a lot last year of really being

471
00:28:45,019 --> 00:28:46,360
open with the community.

472
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,183
And I encourage you all to really try to like, I've had

473
00:28:50,223 --> 00:28:51,584
it since Arma 3.

474
00:28:53,582 --> 00:28:58,550
If you really connect with the community and you get almost community ambassadors that

475
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:02,175
will tell you or tell the community what your plans are.

476
00:29:02,275 --> 00:29:05,841
So someone's kicking up a stink in a forum, you've got someone that will step in and go,

477
00:29:05,881 --> 00:29:09,266
well no, they're actually doing this, or it's not as bad as you might think.

478
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:14,558
We did a lot of that last year, really working closely with the community because they're

479
00:29:14,898 --> 00:29:21,964
your voice to the larger player base and it's important to keep in contact with them.

480
00:29:22,164 --> 00:29:25,347
The last few months we've had our heads down because we've been trying to come up with

481
00:29:25,387 --> 00:29:29,870
a road map, but this year we want to get back to how we were last year, how we were so open

482
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:32,472
and very transparent about what we were doing.

483
00:29:34,167 --> 00:29:35,628
It was also, I remember last year,

484
00:29:35,688 --> 00:29:38,310
like, you know, we'd have these monthly meetings

485
00:29:38,391 --> 00:29:40,793
where you would share what you've done this year,

486
00:29:41,053 --> 00:29:42,014
or what you've done this month,

487
00:29:42,554 --> 00:29:44,676
what you've learned and how you can improve.

488
00:29:44,756 --> 00:29:46,398
And these were great meetings

489
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:48,600
because the whole team learned something

490
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,821
and they got to show off,

491
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,904
like this was our new water shader for terrain.

492
00:29:52,944 --> 00:29:55,346
And, you know, this is the first time you'd see this

493
00:29:55,386 --> 00:29:57,348
and people were just genuinely excited, you know,

494
00:29:57,368 --> 00:29:58,369
because it just...

495
00:29:59,315 --> 00:30:05,058
we're trying to create a realistic battle royale and, you know, Bluehole were used to making, you know, MMO or PG games,

496
00:30:05,118 --> 00:30:10,861
so making a realistic game was a challenge, you know, because it was not something they had experience doing,

497
00:30:10,941 --> 00:30:15,263
and they're really doing it so well. Tess Ock, our world design lead, he...

498
00:30:16,363 --> 00:30:21,566
you know, he's such a passion for creating these worlds, and, you know, we're still learning and still improving,

499
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:28,669
but you'll see with the maps we have coming that we're really trying to upgrade and improve every time we release something.

500
00:30:30,017 --> 00:30:34,518
our team keeps growing. This is us just before launch last year, when we were still about

501
00:30:34,878 --> 00:30:42,880
40 people strong. We had at this stage kind of decided, you know, we really needed to

502
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:47,902
look into doing things a bit more seriously for the game. With our weapons, because it

503
00:30:47,922 --> 00:30:55,644
was such a massive part of a PvP game, Pavel, our action and gunplay lead, you know, he

504
00:30:55,684 --> 00:30:58,925
took the lead in coming to Prague and doing...

505
00:30:59,864 --> 00:31:02,905
mocap for us, so we really got a good character system.

506
00:31:03,765 --> 00:31:07,566
Picking a stance that we wanted to emulate across the whole

507
00:31:07,606 --> 00:31:09,086
character system was very important.

508
00:31:09,506 --> 00:31:11,807
It was great also for the team, because a lot of them

509
00:31:11,827 --> 00:31:13,467
had no experience doing mocap.

510
00:31:13,527 --> 00:31:15,868
It's not a big industry in Korea.

511
00:31:16,628 --> 00:31:19,648
And actually, funnily, flying to Prague to do it, rather

512
00:31:19,668 --> 00:31:20,909
than doing it in Korea, worked out cheaper.

513
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:27,204
It was a great learning experience for the team, because they had never seen it done before.

514
00:31:27,704 --> 00:31:32,468
So, seeing how mocap and how hard it is, and especially as the director,

515
00:31:32,868 --> 00:31:35,770
you know, you're on the floor and you're working with them,

516
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:37,711
the actors showing them exactly what you want,

517
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:41,233
because getting that vision across and getting those actions captured is so important.

518
00:31:41,253 --> 00:31:43,054
So, Pavel worked his ass off.

519
00:31:43,855 --> 00:31:46,937
But then we launched, and today is a special day, because...

520
00:31:47,717 --> 00:31:51,422
This time last year, on the 23rd, we launched Entirely Access.

521
00:31:52,102 --> 00:31:53,184
It was a big deal for us.

522
00:31:53,264 --> 00:31:56,347
We had many long nights.

523
00:31:57,709 --> 00:32:00,972
We had many long days also.

524
00:32:02,042 --> 00:32:07,165
You know, I was worried about going into early access because, as I said before, you know,

525
00:32:07,185 --> 00:32:11,347
it just feels that if you do early access, you have to answer X questions about, you know,

526
00:32:11,607 --> 00:32:17,089
all these things. But again, it's a credit to the team that I shared this concern with CH and the

527
00:32:17,129 --> 00:32:23,472
team and we ramped up like testing. So from a very early stage, we got a beta into people's hands,

528
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:28,015
like even a prototype, and let people test it from that early stage and really...

529
00:32:28,765 --> 00:32:30,645
you know, work with them and let them know.

530
00:32:30,665 --> 00:32:32,566
And even during the beta, like, there were times

531
00:32:32,606 --> 00:32:34,447
we were there till 7, 8 o'clock in the morning

532
00:32:34,467 --> 00:32:37,468
just because something on the server decided, no, not today.

533
00:32:37,908 --> 00:32:38,148
Right?

534
00:32:38,368 --> 00:32:39,989
And it just, I don't know, like, it's

535
00:32:40,029 --> 00:32:41,610
running perfectly smoothly the other night.

536
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:44,411
And then today, no, no, it just, it breaks.

537
00:32:45,371 --> 00:32:46,471
But the team, you know, they.

538
00:32:47,183 --> 00:32:48,404
They just, they didn't give up.

539
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:50,545
There was no kind of like, okay, we'll fix this tomorrow.

540
00:32:50,565 --> 00:32:53,347
It was like, okay, we have players waiting to play, let's get them on.

541
00:32:53,407 --> 00:32:57,430
And by the time we launched into early access, we had a relatively stable build.

542
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,712
You know, it was working, people were having fun.

543
00:32:59,732 --> 00:33:03,755
I was watching people play and, you know, I was, I was happy that

544
00:33:04,195 --> 00:33:08,058
we were getting into early access with something stable.

545
00:33:09,329 --> 00:33:20,579
So, you know, where we're now, you know, last year has been crazy, you know, it's been a year, only a year since launch and, you know, we've, I feel so proud of our team because we've accomplished so much, right?

546
00:33:21,259 --> 00:33:30,467
You know, we broke 40 million copies worldwide across platforms, you know, we've, the number one played game on Steam and the only game to break 3 million.

547
00:33:31,911 --> 00:33:35,372
When I started this four years ago, I never thought I'd be saying things like this, right?

548
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:38,932
I mean, three million players CCU is just nuts, right?

549
00:33:39,012 --> 00:33:39,192
It's...

550
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:44,874
I, you know, I did this, which was bizarre, you know?

551
00:33:44,974 --> 00:33:50,335
I was, you know, practicing for two or three days to make sure that, you know, I had my speech right,

552
00:33:50,415 --> 00:33:53,115
and it was a crazy thing to be able to say,

553
00:33:53,135 --> 00:33:55,276
Okay, my game's now on Xbox, right?

554
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:56,376
But, you know, I'm...

555
00:33:56,956 --> 00:33:59,317
This year, looking back, you know, we've now got...

556
00:34:00,069 --> 00:34:06,995
a much bigger team. I like my photography so when I'm back home in Korea I float around the office

557
00:34:07,015 --> 00:34:13,901
with a camera. These are some photos I took that really show the scale of what the team is working

558
00:34:13,961 --> 00:34:14,301
on now.

559
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,427
Some of these people are here today.

560
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:19,568
He'll be laughing at this.

561
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:24,932
But we've grown to be a global company now.

562
00:34:24,972 --> 00:34:26,293
We have offices in Amsterdam.

563
00:34:26,353 --> 00:34:30,116
We have offices with PUBG, MAG, Glory in New York.

564
00:34:30,176 --> 00:34:31,337
We have offices in Madison.

565
00:34:32,558 --> 00:34:35,420
in Santa Monica and in other small offices around the world.

566
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:39,003
And seeing the team grow, it hasn't been easy for us because

567
00:34:39,383 --> 00:34:42,606
you know finding the right people, it really takes a lot of time you know

568
00:34:42,646 --> 00:34:42,906
because

569
00:34:43,267 --> 00:34:46,730
we're trying not only to find people but we're trying to create a

570
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:51,253
culture you know, and trying to create a company that can grow and be here for

571
00:34:51,694 --> 00:34:55,757
you know five, ten years in the future and that takes time because

572
00:34:56,138 --> 00:34:57,879
as I said you want to find the right people but

573
00:34:58,552 --> 00:35:00,233
You know, this year it's been amazing for us.

574
00:35:00,273 --> 00:35:03,635
You know, we handed 100 grand to Gamers Outreach.

575
00:35:03,715 --> 00:35:05,796
We've done many more charity events.

576
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,918
And it's something I'm very proud to be able to say

577
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:12,640
I work with PUBG because they're committed to doing this.

578
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,682
Since Arma days, I've always wanted to give back

579
00:35:15,762 --> 00:35:18,224
and wanted to help, you know, those less fortunate.

580
00:35:18,304 --> 00:35:20,925
And having a company to go, yep, let's do that too,

581
00:35:21,045 --> 00:35:22,386
is an amazing thing to have.

582
00:35:23,427 --> 00:35:25,088
I signed a frying pan for Neymar.

583
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:25,768
Like.

584
00:35:29,618 --> 00:35:30,939
And I get to look like a gangster boss.

585
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:33,280
So, you know, me traveling around the world,

586
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,041
it's tough on development because I'm not there.

587
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:39,602
But again, it's a credit to the team.

588
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:42,343
And, you know, there are some of the team here, right?

589
00:35:42,883 --> 00:35:44,504
Can you stand up for a second, please?

590
00:35:44,524 --> 00:35:48,265
Yeah, don't be shy.

591
00:35:48,585 --> 00:35:49,246
Koreans are shy.

592
00:35:50,146 --> 00:35:51,086
But this is our team.

593
00:35:51,987 --> 00:35:52,687
Well, some of our team.

594
00:35:58,414 --> 00:36:04,516
They're more floating about, but it's hard to take a company now that we're, what, 300 people strong, you know, everywhere.

595
00:36:04,656 --> 00:36:11,279
So, but I really, you know, I'm honored to work with them, you know, and as well like other, like...

596
00:36:12,127 --> 00:36:16,449
We did this at Starladder, you know this... well not we did this, Starladder did this.

597
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:22,173
But you know seeing now PUBG and the Battle Royales and eSport really starting to grow.

598
00:36:22,293 --> 00:36:26,956
We have with PGL on this weekend and the way that they're using tech to offer you

599
00:36:26,996 --> 00:36:28,336
different ways to spectate the game and...

600
00:36:29,252 --> 00:36:33,054
You know, really seeing this starting to grow, it delights me.

601
00:36:33,174 --> 00:36:37,137
It's where I've always imagined a battle royale as an eSport,

602
00:36:37,157 --> 00:36:41,701
a spectacle in eSports where you have 100 people and the first person to lose

603
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:45,183
having to get up and walk off in front of a stadium of 25,000 people.

604
00:36:45,223 --> 00:36:48,406
You know, it's that kind of stuff really excites me.

605
00:36:49,967 --> 00:36:54,591
You know, as a game where we're going, you know, as I said we're really committed to creating these realistic worlds.

606
00:36:55,412 --> 00:37:02,518
You know, Sergi, one of our terrain artists, he just loves terrain and he loves really trying to

607
00:37:03,019 --> 00:37:09,065
make our terrains more and more realistic with our new 8x8 map coming out later this year.

608
00:37:09,745 --> 00:37:15,531
He spent a long time working on it and it really shows it's a beautiful kind of...

609
00:37:16,497 --> 00:37:18,440
upgrade to our previous maps.

610
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,683
And we want to go back to previous maps

611
00:37:20,723 --> 00:37:23,987
and look at improving those and just continue to upgrade.

612
00:37:24,567 --> 00:37:26,991
Again, we want to add more elements

613
00:37:27,031 --> 00:37:28,172
to increase that sort of pull.

614
00:37:29,103 --> 00:37:33,325
realism. I've always imagined Battlegrounds as you're playing a movie, right?

615
00:37:33,966 --> 00:37:37,568
We want to expand on our custom games because that's where I really feel that

616
00:37:37,908 --> 00:37:41,390
you know we let our players create games themselves and really give them...

617
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,452
we can't promise full modding, you know, because

618
00:37:44,612 --> 00:37:48,054
there's security issues, we're trying to be a competitive game, so you know we have

619
00:37:48,094 --> 00:37:48,594
to limit

620
00:37:48,814 --> 00:37:49,975
what you can actually do but...

621
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:56,567
with custom games we really want to give you kind of fine-grained control over the game via UI but

622
00:37:56,607 --> 00:38:01,656
still allow you to to mess and play with these battlegrounds to create your own game modes.

623
00:38:02,347 --> 00:38:05,410
You know, as I said, we've got lots of new content coming out this year.

624
00:38:05,611 --> 00:38:08,494
And as I keep saying, we really want to invest in eSports.

625
00:38:08,714 --> 00:38:11,117
And last year, we had to sort of build the game.

626
00:38:11,157 --> 00:38:12,980
And this year, we get to polish off the game,

627
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,284
really add the extra out game features we need,

628
00:38:16,344 --> 00:38:18,747
and really kind of start to invest in eSports.

629
00:38:18,807 --> 00:38:20,309
And as I said, like you have.

630
00:38:21,676 --> 00:38:25,657
Things like Starladder, PGL, ESL, they all put on these wonderful

631
00:38:26,418 --> 00:38:30,019
invitationals and it gives us so much knowledge to try to

632
00:38:30,959 --> 00:38:34,541
improve what we do next. So, you know, this year we really want to focus on that.

633
00:38:34,561 --> 00:38:34,961
And as I said,

634
00:38:35,861 --> 00:38:38,982
we're growing globally now and, you know, it takes time to get these teams

635
00:38:39,042 --> 00:38:41,623
in place but it really will help us sustain the game.

636
00:38:42,504 --> 00:38:47,906
So, that's it for me. Before I go, just because it's GDC and I should show you something new,

637
00:38:48,186 --> 00:38:52,548
I want to show you a small preview of our new map that we're releasing shortly.

638
00:38:52,568 --> 00:38:59,931
This is going to be a 4x4 map, much more intense, 100 players, and I think it's going to be a lot of fun.

639
00:39:00,631 --> 00:39:04,173
So, that's what it looks like. This may start playing.

640
00:39:06,807 --> 00:39:07,548
There we go.

641
00:39:08,029 --> 00:39:11,434
So yeah, it's a much smaller map, much more uniform,

642
00:39:11,935 --> 00:39:14,498
and in a kind of a Southeast Asian feel.

643
00:39:14,899 --> 00:39:16,501
Now, this is very early, right?

644
00:39:16,561 --> 00:39:18,064
So forgive.

645
00:39:19,506 --> 00:39:20,707
But I'm looking forward to it, because it's

646
00:39:20,727 --> 00:39:22,270
going to be much more intense, right?

647
00:39:23,071 --> 00:39:23,211
It's

648
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:30,435
it harks back to my days of creating these other game modes within Arma because you know

649
00:39:30,956 --> 00:39:37,162
Battle Royale is a fun experience that that sort of ever-decreasing circle and that random game every time

650
00:39:37,262 --> 00:39:42,808
So, you know, I just want to try lots and lots of more ideas. So that's it for me. If you've got questions

651
00:39:43,569 --> 00:39:44,370
Please line up

652
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,971
Yeah, thank you very much

653
00:39:57,047 --> 00:39:57,267
Hi.

654
00:39:58,288 --> 00:39:58,488
Hello.

655
00:39:58,508 --> 00:39:59,949
Well, took the whole thing off.

656
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:01,690
Just had a question for you.

657
00:40:03,311 --> 00:40:07,874
How did you choose balancing stuff from sim games,

658
00:40:07,934 --> 00:40:10,615
like Arma, and some of the more arcade-y stuff,

659
00:40:10,796 --> 00:40:12,737
like H1Z1, so like you're driving and stuff?

660
00:40:12,757 --> 00:40:14,778
Like how, where did you make those decisions

661
00:40:14,818 --> 00:40:16,379
of to what to include and what not to?

662
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:23,125
It was more we looked at it always kind of as a split between Arma and H1.

663
00:40:23,566 --> 00:40:25,787
You know, the body sim is quite simple.

664
00:40:25,847 --> 00:40:28,828
You know, we've got pretty simple to hit boxes.

665
00:40:29,128 --> 00:40:30,529
And, you know, we're still improving that.

666
00:40:30,629 --> 00:40:34,570
But we really want to, you know, come somewhere in between.

667
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:37,452
Because I like that, really, I like the choice of weapons.

668
00:40:37,492 --> 00:40:39,473
I like the choice of attachments in Arma.

669
00:40:39,513 --> 00:40:44,094
And bringing that into our game was like sort of, you know, obvious to us.

670
00:40:45,117 --> 00:40:47,819
Yeah, I don't know, it was just we always kind of went 50-50 between them.

671
00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:52,442
It was because I like my MilSim, but you know, I like the ease.

672
00:40:52,522 --> 00:40:56,805
And even in Arma, I really stripped back a lot of the the features of Arma,

673
00:40:56,825 --> 00:40:59,667
like fatigue and stuff, because I wanted to be that little bit more arcadey.

674
00:41:00,387 --> 00:41:00,908
Cool. Thank you.

675
00:41:01,068 --> 00:41:02,009
Thanks for the question.

676
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:06,172
Hi. When you move to the Arma mod,

677
00:41:08,923 --> 00:41:11,065
Why did you drop the PvE elements?

678
00:41:11,365 --> 00:41:14,167
Was that kind of just because it wasn't easily available to you?

679
00:41:14,207 --> 00:41:16,608
Yeah, pretty much. I mean, there were no zombie mods in...

680
00:41:16,628 --> 00:41:19,390
Well, there were zombie mods in Arma 3, but nothing I would use.

681
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:23,133
And I wanted it to be a fresh start for the game mode.

682
00:41:23,213 --> 00:41:26,835
That this was a differentiator from DayZ Battle Royale,

683
00:41:26,855 --> 00:41:28,316
this was PlayerUnknown's Battle Royale.

684
00:41:28,376 --> 00:41:30,798
So, again, just focusing on the PvP, because that's what I loved.

685
00:41:31,285 --> 00:41:33,907
Okay, is that an element you think you might explore again?

686
00:41:34,307 --> 00:41:36,968
Well, we now have like our zombies game mode.

687
00:41:37,668 --> 00:41:42,051
So, you know, a Korean streamer came up with it on a stream and we put it into the game

688
00:41:42,091 --> 00:41:46,813
and we have our zombie models and I swear to God, like, zombies that aren't AI and are

689
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:48,153
other players are so much more fun.

690
00:41:48,774 --> 00:41:53,096
You know, I've seen videos where they're hiding in the grass and suddenly 40 zombies pop up.

691
00:41:53,616 --> 00:41:58,058
So I really want to, we really want to kind of explore that a bit further and kind of

692
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:58,538
increase...

693
00:41:59,482 --> 00:42:01,623
you know, how that kind of game mode can be played.

694
00:42:05,266 --> 00:42:07,308
Given what you know now over the past year,

695
00:42:07,428 --> 00:42:10,270
would you think about monetizing PUBG any differently

696
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:11,351
than what you ended up doing?

697
00:42:12,152 --> 00:42:12,812
No, not really.

698
00:42:13,052 --> 00:42:15,895
Like, I'm a big fan of the crate and skin system.

699
00:42:16,035 --> 00:42:19,818
You know, I think in CS it works.

700
00:42:19,878 --> 00:42:21,679
You know, it provides a sustainable economy.

701
00:42:22,967 --> 00:42:25,850
I see it every day with players that meet me going,

702
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,852
oh, well, thank you, I sold this on,

703
00:42:28,272 --> 00:42:29,773
I got this skin and I sold it

704
00:42:29,793 --> 00:42:32,035
and now I don't need to buy games for the next year.

705
00:42:32,836 --> 00:42:34,217
This kind of idea that it does work,

706
00:42:34,337 --> 00:42:37,260
it's somehow, it's not fair a lot of the times,

707
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,081
but in order to have that economy,

708
00:42:39,942 --> 00:42:40,963
it needs to be a certain way

709
00:42:41,003 --> 00:42:42,785
and I think it's a great way to sustain the game.

710
00:42:43,525 --> 00:42:45,547
Yeah, so I mean too with going free to play

711
00:42:45,607 --> 00:42:47,749
instead of doing a box price at the beginning

712
00:42:47,789 --> 00:42:48,570
to try to get a higher.

713
00:42:49,435 --> 00:42:52,076
Oh no, I mean, we always wanted to have a box price.

714
00:42:52,117 --> 00:42:53,157
That was the aim here.

715
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:54,918
We didn't think about going free to play.

716
00:42:54,938 --> 00:42:55,879
It's a different model.

717
00:42:56,099 --> 00:43:00,482
And we never thought, yeah, we always had a box price in mind.

718
00:43:00,502 --> 00:43:05,025
Just shout.

719
00:43:05,045 --> 00:43:08,707
So I guess just what are your thoughts on Fortnite?

720
00:43:08,987 --> 00:43:10,048
What are you thinking about it?

721
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:13,190
I have many thoughts.

722
00:43:16,192 --> 00:43:16,872
No, it's great.

723
00:43:16,953 --> 00:43:18,093
Like, I mean, it's great that.

724
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:23,283
you know, the battle royale space is expanding and that like, you know, Fortnite is getting

725
00:43:23,803 --> 00:43:28,526
battle royale game mode into hands of a lot more people. So you know, it grows the genre, right?

726
00:43:28,686 --> 00:43:33,949
I mean, that's it really. I mean, I'm just happy that more and more people are getting to see

727
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:38,252
games and then getting to play games. And this year I think we're going to see a big expansion

728
00:43:38,892 --> 00:43:42,194
in, you know, the amount of people that actually come and try games.

729
00:43:43,805 --> 00:43:50,151
My partner played PUBG Mobile and messaged me like two hours after she was going to bed,

730
00:43:50,632 --> 00:43:54,836
you know, saying, I finally killed someone. You know, that this just, she doesn't stop playing now.

731
00:43:56,195 --> 00:44:01,597
But it's just great to see, like, I get asked these questions sometimes of like,

732
00:44:01,637 --> 00:44:03,158
you know, what are you doing to combat this?

733
00:44:03,198 --> 00:44:06,799
You know, I got it when we came out, you know, we were killing H1,

734
00:44:06,919 --> 00:44:09,080
or, you know, when H1 came out, it was killing Arma 3.

735
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,541
And I never said it to kill other people's games.

736
00:44:11,741 --> 00:44:14,542
You know, I don't understand this attitude.

737
00:44:14,582 --> 00:44:16,443
Like, you're devs, you get it, you know?

738
00:44:16,483 --> 00:44:18,903
Like, we're all relatively friendly here, you know?

739
00:44:18,943 --> 00:44:24,065
We don't have a in-real-life GDC battle royale to see whose game comes out, right?

740
00:44:24,666 --> 00:44:30,752
So, you know, this, we have to kind of, I've really tried to combat that perception that I want other people's games to die.

741
00:44:30,952 --> 00:44:35,978
You know, it's like, it's great that more people are exploring the space and more people are getting to play games.

742
00:44:38,792 --> 00:44:42,916
I was curious how you go about testing these large format game types, you know, 100 players,

743
00:44:42,936 --> 00:44:46,520
do you start with 50, start with 25, does the number really matter because it's just

744
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:47,781
pockets of combat anyway?

745
00:44:48,182 --> 00:44:52,606
Oh it does matter, I mean when we started off we did have very limited QA so you'd have

746
00:44:52,646 --> 00:44:56,490
like 30 player or 20 player battle royales and they're fine to test the loot system to

747
00:44:56,550 --> 00:45:01,795
test, you know, but you know for actual large scale combat it, you know, it does get tricky.

748
00:45:02,536 --> 00:45:03,758
We started off very early.

749
00:45:03,778 --> 00:45:08,763
We had a pre-alpha build where we invited maybe 600 to 1,000

750
00:45:10,305 --> 00:45:14,109
players of H1, of Arma 3, and not just streamers, but just

751
00:45:14,129 --> 00:45:17,953
players from the community to come and help us test.

752
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:21,577
And we ran these tests on a monthly basis, where we would

753
00:45:21,617 --> 00:45:22,538
just improve something.

754
00:45:23,259 --> 00:45:24,079
and run it again.

755
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:26,240
So we involved the community from a very early stage

756
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,601
because with a multiplayer game,

757
00:45:27,921 --> 00:45:30,323
you have to have a lot of testing, right?

758
00:45:31,403 --> 00:45:32,984
And involving your community from that stage.

759
00:45:33,504 --> 00:45:34,645
You know, they shouldn't see the game.

760
00:45:34,805 --> 00:45:36,046
The game doesn't look anything

761
00:45:36,146 --> 00:45:37,607
like what you want it to look like.

762
00:45:38,207 --> 00:45:39,968
But for a multiplayer game,

763
00:45:40,168 --> 00:45:42,349
I strongly advocate getting that community in

764
00:45:42,389 --> 00:45:43,050
and letting them play.

765
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:47,772
How did all that work before you had a large community?

766
00:45:47,792 --> 00:45:48,352
So your earlier in mind?

767
00:45:48,372 --> 00:45:48,793
Differently.

768
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:51,794
You know, now, like we had,

769
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:57,516
The server infrastructure was designed for like a million CCU because we thought that's

770
00:45:57,776 --> 00:46:02,102
double dota, we're not hitting a million, and then we passed two million in six months.

771
00:46:02,182 --> 00:46:04,645
So we had to rewrite everything, right?

772
00:46:05,857 --> 00:46:09,960
going to that scale you have to be careful about things you roll out you know because

773
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:14,102
you know one thing or another some the community may not like it we rolled out a change to

774
00:46:14,343 --> 00:46:18,746
to looting that the community just hated and we had to roll it back but you know having the

775
00:46:18,786 --> 00:46:23,389
community to tell you very quickly if if they don't like your ideas and it's why this year we want to

776
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:26,941
go back to running an experimental test server,

777
00:46:26,962 --> 00:46:30,803
getting community content much quicker so they can give us

778
00:46:30,843 --> 00:46:31,223
feedback.

779
00:46:31,283 --> 00:46:33,764
Because it's very easy to release something that you

780
00:46:33,804 --> 00:46:36,205
think they want, but then the community will very quickly,

781
00:46:36,285 --> 00:46:36,945
no, we don't want that.

782
00:46:37,265 --> 00:46:37,986
Why are you doing this?

783
00:46:38,066 --> 00:46:41,827
So at that scale, we really think iteration and a lot of

784
00:46:41,847 --> 00:46:44,508
testing now at this scale will really help us get good

785
00:46:44,548 --> 00:46:45,048
content out.

786
00:46:46,489 --> 00:46:46,649
Thanks.

787
00:46:48,045 --> 00:46:57,507
What are your thoughts on using bots and NPCs basically to populate servers early on in a game's life or to astroturf for a new player?

788
00:46:57,547 --> 00:47:00,207
Is that something you guys do, especially with the mobile version?

789
00:47:00,967 --> 00:47:02,788
And do you think there are pros and cons to that approach?

790
00:47:03,248 --> 00:47:06,168
I mean, I know on the mobile version there's been talk of bots.

791
00:47:06,928 --> 00:47:08,429
I don't actually know.

792
00:47:09,549 --> 00:47:15,570
But, you know, what I've heard from a lot of people is that it eases them into the game a lot quicker.

793
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:16,810
You know, like, I mean...

794
00:47:17,531 --> 00:47:20,193
I think as you play the game more, they get much, much less.

795
00:47:20,253 --> 00:47:24,696
But I think it eases you in because it's a tough game.

796
00:47:25,977 --> 00:47:26,898
Battle Royale is not easy.

797
00:47:27,459 --> 00:47:32,282
I think the odds to win your first game are 1 in 6,000.

798
00:47:32,542 --> 00:47:34,364
So I think it's like double the chance

799
00:47:34,404 --> 00:47:35,365
to get struck by lightning.

800
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:39,928
So having systems like this, it just

801
00:47:40,008 --> 00:47:41,209
helps you ease into the game.

802
00:47:41,309 --> 00:47:44,211
So I don't necessarily see them as a super bad thing.

803
00:47:45,012 --> 00:47:45,172
Thanks.

804
00:47:48,309 --> 00:47:54,441
I wanted to ask about, what are your thoughts about when is a bug okay to go to production?

805
00:47:54,461 --> 00:47:55,844
So as an example, I...

806
00:47:56,425 --> 00:47:57,487
We believe always.

807
00:47:59,705 --> 00:48:00,825
No, I mean, yeah, sorry.

808
00:48:01,325 --> 00:48:03,225
I mean, as an example, I was driving in a Jeep,

809
00:48:03,526 --> 00:48:07,646
and I collided with a grenade, which was stuck midair

810
00:48:07,726 --> 00:48:09,047
and had this huge collision.

811
00:48:09,407 --> 00:48:10,687
My friends and I all thought it was hilarious,

812
00:48:10,727 --> 00:48:12,447
which was part of, actually, one of the things

813
00:48:12,467 --> 00:48:14,528
that we enjoyed, which I think is interesting.

814
00:48:14,548 --> 00:48:18,129
But I was just curious if that was sort of a part

815
00:48:18,149 --> 00:48:19,889
of the intent, where, you know, like,

816
00:48:20,329 --> 00:48:21,989
we're gonna ship this out early, it's intentionally buggy,

817
00:48:22,029 --> 00:48:24,370
but you'll run into sort of these fun, random things

818
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:26,250
that you, will happen, or?

819
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:27,931
Yeah, I was just curious what your thoughts were.

820
00:48:27,951 --> 00:48:33,514
I mean, I don't think any game dev wants the game to be a buggy mess when they release.

821
00:48:33,575 --> 00:48:36,556
But there are bugs in Battle Royale.

822
00:48:37,157 --> 00:48:39,578
There's issues because of what we have to do.

823
00:48:39,658 --> 00:48:41,559
So there's like 100 players and 200 vehicles,

824
00:48:41,639 --> 00:48:45,882
and simulating that amount of stuff, especially with server and client,

825
00:48:45,962 --> 00:48:48,143
it can lead to all kinds of physics problems.

826
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,500
Game development is inherently buggy.

827
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:57,983
So we released a map with the Blue Zone very early in

828
00:48:58,003 --> 00:48:58,464
development.

829
00:48:59,024 --> 00:49:01,306
So you got to see all the bugs.

830
00:49:01,626 --> 00:49:03,547
The bugs that maybe AAA companies would go, no, you

831
00:49:03,567 --> 00:49:04,147
can't see this.

832
00:49:04,207 --> 00:49:05,128
But I love it.

833
00:49:05,468 --> 00:49:06,869
It creates content.

834
00:49:06,989 --> 00:49:08,290
Bugs in games are funny.

835
00:49:08,731 --> 00:49:11,472
We have the PUBG Rocket program.

836
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:14,114
It's provided many, many hours of entertainment online.

837
00:49:14,134 --> 00:49:15,355
AUDIENCE MEMBER 3 Cool.

838
00:49:15,375 --> 00:49:15,615
Thanks.

839
00:49:15,935 --> 00:49:16,276
Thanks, man.

840
00:49:20,859 --> 00:49:21,119
That is.

841
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:35,605
So I know that you mentioned the Hunger Games, but I was wondering if the original Battle Royale

842
00:49:35,645 --> 00:49:40,548
Japanese film, I think 2000, 2001, was that part of the inspiration? Oh no, 100%.

843
00:49:41,229 --> 00:49:46,733
I've never seen anybody mention that. Oh yeah, so Battle Royale came, like, so when I first

844
00:49:47,173 --> 00:49:51,336
had the idea to make a mod, there was a guy that was friends with me, he was a designer,

845
00:49:51,856 --> 00:49:54,458
and he was saying, oh we should do the Daisy Hunger Games, right?

846
00:49:55,437 --> 00:49:58,502
and the Survivor Games existed, so I didn't really like that idea.

847
00:49:58,842 --> 00:50:04,752
And during that week, we weren't talking, and I remember I'd seen something to do

848
00:50:04,832 --> 00:50:06,555
about Royale, and I loved that movie.

849
00:50:08,124 --> 00:50:09,264
I kind of looked at it and went, OK, this

850
00:50:09,304 --> 00:50:10,304
can be a last man standing.

851
00:50:10,344 --> 00:50:11,465
This doesn't have to be teams.

852
00:50:11,485 --> 00:50:12,125
It doesn't have to be.

853
00:50:12,705 --> 00:50:14,246
And I looked at the Battle Royale movie.

854
00:50:14,306 --> 00:50:17,628
It's very loosely connected to the Battle Royale movie.

855
00:50:17,688 --> 00:50:19,568
But I just love the name, right?

856
00:50:19,789 --> 00:50:22,490
And even in the game, we have a frying pan

857
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:25,191
because I thought there's a frying pan in the Battle Royale

858
00:50:25,231 --> 00:50:26,732
movie, and it's a nice tribute to add.

859
00:50:26,972 --> 00:50:28,472
There is no frying pan in the Battle Royale movie.

860
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:31,033
There's a saucepan lid, but no frying pan.

861
00:50:31,574 --> 00:50:33,554
So that's a mistake.

862
00:50:34,635 --> 00:50:35,575
The frying pan being.

863
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,262
Bulletproof, again, is a mistake.

864
00:50:40,762 --> 00:50:41,823
We were testing it internally.

865
00:50:42,143 --> 00:50:43,864
I talked with the design team and went, listen,

866
00:50:43,904 --> 00:50:46,286
can we try to do this and see if it works?

867
00:50:46,887 --> 00:50:47,327
It worked.

868
00:50:47,687 --> 00:50:48,968
Then we forgot to take it out of the build.

869
00:50:49,109 --> 00:50:50,109
Build got pushed to live.

870
00:50:50,249 --> 00:50:51,611
And now we have bulletproof fine vans.

871
00:50:52,311 --> 00:50:55,093
So a lot of this stuff was beautiful mistakes.

872
00:50:55,233 --> 00:50:57,535
But the Battle Royale movie, it really didn't inspire me.

873
00:50:57,555 --> 00:51:00,057
The red zone is because I couldn't do a collar for people.

874
00:51:00,438 --> 00:51:02,099
So I thought there's a way to.

875
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:05,962
you know, threatened death upon people by, you know, this red zone.

876
00:51:06,262 --> 00:51:09,324
I couldn't do squares like they have in the movie because I wasn't a good enough

877
00:51:09,344 --> 00:51:11,326
coder and circles are hard.

878
00:51:11,406 --> 00:51:14,048
So, or no, squares are hard, so I did a circle shrinking

879
00:51:14,428 --> 00:51:17,010
and that's why that exists. So a lot of this stuff came from

880
00:51:17,711 --> 00:51:20,733
inspired by Battle Royale but having to do it my way because I didn't know

881
00:51:20,773 --> 00:51:21,474
another way to do it.

882
00:51:22,455 --> 00:51:23,636
Awesome, thank you.

883
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,001
Yeah, we done?

884
00:51:32,497 --> 00:51:34,516
Nice, and before time, thank you guys.
