1
00:00:05,468 --> 00:00:07,491
Who here has been to the MicroTalks before?

2
00:00:08,992 --> 00:00:09,372
Awesome.

3
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:12,135
If you haven't, brace yourself.

4
00:00:12,275 --> 00:00:14,177
You are in for something a little bit different

5
00:00:14,217 --> 00:00:17,261
than a normal GDC talk, where we have 10 speakers

6
00:00:17,321 --> 00:00:19,062
who are going to speak over the next hour,

7
00:00:19,203 --> 00:00:21,705
and they each have very specific guidelines.

8
00:00:21,745 --> 00:00:24,808
They each get 20 slides that play for 16 seconds a piece,

9
00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:26,350
no more and no less.

10
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:27,831
They are set on a timer.

11
00:00:28,712 --> 00:00:32,295
It is very emotionally intense to be up here.

12
00:00:33,495 --> 00:00:36,078
And it's always under one overarching theme,

13
00:00:36,398 --> 00:00:38,359
which this year is creative voice.

14
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,082
And I'm joined by the amazing Mike Jungbluth,

15
00:00:41,102 --> 00:00:41,882
who's going to kick it off.

16
00:00:41,902 --> 00:00:42,963
Hey, Mike.

17
00:00:42,983 --> 00:00:43,043
Woo!

18
00:00:43,063 --> 00:00:43,163
Woo!

19
00:00:43,423 --> 00:00:43,483
Woo!

20
00:00:43,503 --> 00:00:43,563
Woo!

21
00:00:43,624 --> 00:00:43,684
Woo!

22
00:00:43,704 --> 00:00:43,764
Woo!

23
00:00:43,784 --> 00:00:43,844
Woo!

24
00:00:43,864 --> 00:00:43,924
Woo!

25
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:44,004
Woo!

26
00:00:44,264 --> 00:00:44,404
Woo!

27
00:00:44,424 --> 00:00:44,584
Woo!

28
00:00:44,624 --> 00:00:44,684
Woo!

29
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:49,989
Woo!

30
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:50,549
All right, here we go.

31
00:00:52,857 --> 00:00:56,439
Hi, I'm Mike Jungluth, a lead gameplay animator at BioWare,

32
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:58,661
and I'm creator of the Animation Bootcamp

33
00:00:58,801 --> 00:01:00,122
and the Animation Exchange.

34
00:01:00,662 --> 00:01:03,984
So for the next six minutes, it makes perfect sense for me

35
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,866
to talk about the benefits of supporting a creative voice,

36
00:01:07,327 --> 00:01:09,288
both your own and others.

37
00:01:09,848 --> 00:01:11,509
The core of what we do as animators,

38
00:01:11,649 --> 00:01:13,651
technical animators, and animation programmers

39
00:01:13,711 --> 00:01:15,752
is support other people's voices

40
00:01:15,812 --> 00:01:17,013
and help bring them to life.

41
00:01:17,413 --> 00:01:18,754
This goes for both our teammates

42
00:01:18,814 --> 00:01:19,835
and the characters in our games,

43
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:20,796
and that support is, well,

44
00:01:22,145 --> 00:01:23,646
It's just so tiring.

45
00:01:25,027 --> 00:01:28,069
I mean, when you've made so many similar combat and locomotion

46
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:30,571
systems from game to game that it feels like Groundhog Day,

47
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:33,172
summoning the strength to get excited

48
00:01:33,272 --> 00:01:36,995
about another mashup of other proven game systems

49
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,636
and power fantasies can just get harder.

50
00:01:40,457 --> 00:01:46,805
and harder. So, if I'm being honest here, more than some altruistic idea of supporting other

51
00:01:46,845 --> 00:01:51,932
people's creative voices, this is really about what are we doing with ours? We all hit a point

52
00:01:51,952 --> 00:01:56,237
where we sort of say, what the hell am I really doing with my animation and these characters that

53
00:01:56,257 --> 00:01:57,359
I'm helping to bring to life?

54
00:01:57,839 --> 00:02:01,561
Do I want to work on giant games with giant teams or do I want to work on a smaller team

55
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:02,381
and go the indie route?

56
00:02:02,721 --> 00:02:06,063
After all these years figuring out the skills I need for the type of work I do now, can

57
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,564
I even scale that up or out as needed for the other type of work?

58
00:02:08,604 --> 00:02:12,666
And who the hell do I think I am that I could even say anything that anyone would care about

59
00:02:12,906 --> 00:02:13,506
to begin with?

60
00:02:14,345 --> 00:02:16,986
Okay, imposter syndrome, what should I do?

61
00:02:17,406 --> 00:02:19,347
I could go skydiving to feel a little alive.

62
00:02:19,947 --> 00:02:21,067
There we go, ha ha.

63
00:02:21,368 --> 00:02:23,008
That's the sweet adrenaline boost that I needed.

64
00:02:23,428 --> 00:02:25,009
Maybe that can masquerade as confidence

65
00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:26,110
for my remaining four minutes.

66
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,051
Four minutes, what have I been talking about

67
00:02:29,071 --> 00:02:29,991
for the last two minutes?

68
00:02:30,111 --> 00:02:31,712
All right, let's check my notes.

69
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:36,094
Okay, that doesn't mean anything, that doesn't help.

70
00:02:36,394 --> 00:02:38,174
What, fuck.

71
00:02:38,334 --> 00:02:41,416
Okay, support, supporting a creative voice, right.

72
00:02:42,176 --> 00:02:45,277
Look at that bastard faking confidence on slide one.

73
00:02:46,297 --> 00:02:48,417
Ugh, fake it till you make it, right?

74
00:02:49,438 --> 00:02:51,358
We could easily waste our next three minutes

75
00:02:51,478 --> 00:02:53,179
on if you ever stop feeling like a fake,

76
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:54,779
or if you can ever really make it,

77
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:56,419
and the very feeling of making it

78
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:57,940
leading to the tedium that got us here,

79
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,681
but let's look at the space between fake it and make it.

80
00:03:03,647 --> 00:03:08,189
Knowledge and expertise are the bridge over the fake it to make it gap.

81
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:09,810
They're the reason we're all here.

82
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,431
They're why the bootcamp and the exchange exist.

83
00:03:14,011 --> 00:03:16,432
The more you learn about a subject, the less of a fake you are.

84
00:03:16,472 --> 00:03:19,614
And the more you can share how you made it, well, the better it is for everyone.

85
00:03:19,754 --> 00:03:19,894
But.

86
00:03:20,674 --> 00:03:23,795
that's really been largely focused on the how of the craft.

87
00:03:23,895 --> 00:03:26,056
And while the how remains important,

88
00:03:26,636 --> 00:03:29,037
the what you're saying and why you're saying it of our craft

89
00:03:29,117 --> 00:03:30,778
now needs a lot more focus.

90
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:34,239
Otherwise, we've really just built a bridge to nowhere.

91
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,301
or worse, an unwelcoming forest.

92
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:40,702
Because the knowledge and expertise we needed to get here

93
00:03:40,863 --> 00:03:42,523
is often separate from the expertise

94
00:03:42,563 --> 00:03:43,684
required to pass through.

95
00:03:44,204 --> 00:03:47,246
We need to become versed in sociology, psychology,

96
00:03:47,366 --> 00:03:50,628
philosophy, economics, anthropology, archeology,

97
00:03:50,668 --> 00:03:51,728
a whole bunch more ologies.

98
00:03:52,128 --> 00:03:54,309
Sure, you don't need to know what all of these things are

99
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,351
to share your hot take on the what and why,

100
00:03:56,751 --> 00:03:59,492
but we as creators should strive to engage

101
00:03:59,532 --> 00:04:02,974
with everything in life to the degree we do our animations.

102
00:04:03,454 --> 00:04:06,416
It can be your torch as you venture into that unwelcoming forest.

103
00:04:07,737 --> 00:04:10,399
But if creativity is the spark that lights your torch,

104
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,862
knowledge of the subject is going to be the fuel that will keep it lit.

105
00:04:14,442 --> 00:04:18,865
And like water to a flame, lack of knowledge will actually weaken your torch

106
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:22,268
until it's eventually extinguished, leaving you in the dark.

107
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:27,536
alone. And relighting an extinguished light is even harder than lighting a new one.

108
00:04:27,936 --> 00:04:31,740
The amount of knowledge to cover the doubt you and others will have about your ideas and

109
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:38,487
approaches will make even the brightest of creative sparks feel dull and, well, lifeless.

110
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:42,728
So we need to make the forest less of that and more of this.

111
00:04:43,488 --> 00:04:45,790
To help the people crossing the bridge of how

112
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,172
not succumb to instant burnout and cynicism.

113
00:04:48,593 --> 00:04:50,674
Because like the bridge we built and maintain,

114
00:04:51,015 --> 00:04:53,197
we now have a lot of forest paths to light,

115
00:04:53,677 --> 00:04:55,459
which isn't gonna be easy.

116
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:58,701
So when you see people speaking about the what and why,

117
00:04:58,862 --> 00:05:00,283
even if all you want is the how,

118
00:05:01,084 --> 00:05:02,805
Listen, it can matter someday.

119
00:05:03,285 --> 00:05:08,028
If you're thinking this isn't an animation talk, well I see you, but my remaining minute

120
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:10,150
can't be the end of this conversation.

121
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:16,914
We all need to be open and honest about what we know and what we don't know.

122
00:05:17,535 --> 00:05:19,896
When you have a source of knowledge, share it.

123
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:22,058
When you don't, listen.

124
00:05:22,858 --> 00:05:27,381
Then we can all know how much fuel we have and where to fuel up when any of us need it.

125
00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:31,052
We need to then know our platforms that we engage with,

126
00:05:31,112 --> 00:05:32,973
social media, conferences, our games.

127
00:05:33,514 --> 00:05:35,535
They allow us to engage with different amounts

128
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,756
of immediacy, agency, and directness,

129
00:05:38,216 --> 00:05:40,598
which can multiply the intensity of your light.

130
00:05:41,138 --> 00:05:43,620
And each is gonna require different amounts of fuel.

131
00:05:44,872 --> 00:05:47,935
Because the what and why are less objective than the how.

132
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,017
So we need to be better at balancing our engagement

133
00:05:51,057 --> 00:05:52,899
with what we and others make.

134
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:55,981
Take care not to burn out your own torch

135
00:05:56,121 --> 00:05:57,703
or to burn down another's path

136
00:05:57,803 --> 00:05:59,384
when trying to light the way.

137
00:06:00,552 --> 00:06:05,675
My hope is that this week we have a lot more what and why conversations on our path through

138
00:06:05,695 --> 00:06:11,119
the forest because in the forest is a new world full of inspiring and unique creations

139
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:17,743
pushing all of us to know more about the craft and ourselves but also each other by honestly

140
00:06:17,823 --> 00:06:19,043
supporting each other's voice.

141
00:06:19,664 --> 00:06:19,924
Thank you.

142
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:36,345
Our work is never finished, only abandoned, or how to ship unfinished animation and feel

143
00:06:36,365 --> 00:06:36,905
good about it.

144
00:06:39,547 --> 00:06:40,788
Hi, my name is Kristen.

145
00:06:41,008 --> 00:06:43,851
I'm an animator and I've been in the industry for almost 10 years.

146
00:06:44,131 --> 00:06:49,075
In my career, I've shipped over 16 titles and have been credited on probably more than 20.

147
00:06:49,655 --> 00:06:53,178
Doing the math, that's almost two games a year, or more than that if you take everything

148
00:06:53,218 --> 00:06:54,139
into consideration.

149
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,502
Yeah, that's a lot of projects. This isn't a brag, I bring it up because it means I've dealt

150
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:04,244
with some very tight deadlines and when you don't have enough time or resources, you have to find

151
00:07:04,284 --> 00:07:10,226
ways to ship unfinished animation and feel good about it. Shipping unfinished animation? That

152
00:07:10,286 --> 00:07:15,589
sounds kind of embarrassing. Sometimes no matter how much time and energy you put into something,

153
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:20,591
it's not going to be good just because video games. It's up to you to dig into your creative

154
00:07:20,631 --> 00:07:24,793
toolbox and tackle all the problems, expected and unexpected, that are thrown at you.

155
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:28,182
You know, there's the age-old problems.

156
00:07:28,562 --> 00:07:30,583
Perhaps game design is at lockdown.

157
00:07:30,923 --> 00:07:32,904
Perhaps some big opportunity arose

158
00:07:32,944 --> 00:07:34,144
and you have to ship early.

159
00:07:34,785 --> 00:07:37,466
Or perhaps you just never even had enough time to begin with.

160
00:07:38,406 --> 00:07:40,507
And then there's the weirder problems.

161
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:42,928
Perhaps all your animations are sped up

162
00:07:42,968 --> 00:07:45,789
to match the beat of a song out of your control.

163
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:47,710
Or your animations are shared

164
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,351
across totally wildly different characters.

165
00:07:51,242 --> 00:07:52,903
Or you can animate your character's body,

166
00:07:53,103 --> 00:07:55,945
but their heads are controlled by a avatared VR headset.

167
00:07:56,686 --> 00:07:58,207
All real things I've had to deal with.

168
00:07:58,847 --> 00:08:01,169
And no matter how normal or weird your problems are,

169
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:02,970
things happen and you just have to get it done.

170
00:08:03,411 --> 00:08:04,972
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying you should

171
00:08:04,992 --> 00:08:06,873
death march, crunch your way through it,

172
00:08:07,214 --> 00:08:08,775
but don't just give up and half-ass it.

173
00:08:08,935 --> 00:08:10,976
Work smart, not just hard.

174
00:08:11,717 --> 00:08:12,598
And real talk?

175
00:08:13,584 --> 00:08:17,047
Focus on what's important and work on the extras if you have time.

176
00:08:17,727 --> 00:08:21,690
Don't sacrifice your friends and family crunching on something that no one's going to notice but you.

177
00:08:22,491 --> 00:08:28,135
Because players are not going to care that you stayed late to put that subtle offset in your character's fingers.

178
00:08:28,815 --> 00:08:31,557
And that's who we're making these games for, the players.

179
00:08:32,118 --> 00:08:37,622
On one game I worked on, I decided it was better to add animation variety than to polish a few animations to a perfect.

180
00:08:38,975 --> 00:08:41,577
polish. I wanted the player to be delighted and surprised when

181
00:08:41,597 --> 00:08:44,299
their character did something fun and unexpected. Always

182
00:08:44,319 --> 00:08:47,601
remember who your game is for. And yes, that means for that

183
00:08:47,641 --> 00:08:50,683
game, I didn't end up with many demo reel pieces. But that

184
00:08:50,703 --> 00:08:53,465
doesn't mean the animation was bad. It accomplished what it

185
00:08:53,485 --> 00:08:56,588
needed to for the situation and the players enjoyed it. You're

186
00:08:56,608 --> 00:09:00,550
making a game, not a demo reel. And that's the point. Really

187
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:04,333
think about what's right for the situation. Sometimes a small set

188
00:09:04,353 --> 00:09:06,335
of hyper polished animations is what you need.

189
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:11,306
or maybe variety is key, and sometimes things are just a mess and you have to be flexible.

190
00:09:12,106 --> 00:09:15,927
And once you have decided on your direction, try to get animations in the game quickly.

191
00:09:16,547 --> 00:09:20,688
Test them, throw them out, and make new ones. This is especially true when the design is

192
00:09:20,748 --> 00:09:24,989
constantly changing. And don't spend time polishing something until you know things

193
00:09:25,069 --> 00:09:31,310
are working as a whole. Once everything is roughed in and working, make a polish priority list.

194
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:36,251
Take the time to identify what animation is most important, even

195
00:09:37,074 --> 00:09:39,216
Ah, and hit polish for them first,

196
00:09:39,456 --> 00:09:40,837
even if they aren't your favorites.

197
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,338
Don't get caught up in the little details

198
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:45,119
and ignore the big picture.

199
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,662
And the next thing to do is to work in passes.

200
00:09:50,063 --> 00:09:51,203
It gives you some leeway

201
00:09:51,844 --> 00:09:53,925
when your team pulls the rug out from under you.

202
00:09:54,606 --> 00:09:57,447
If you haven't focused on polishing animations one at a time,

203
00:09:58,401 --> 00:10:01,702
you won't lose as much work if someone cuts something or changes the design.

204
00:10:02,242 --> 00:10:05,683
You'll also know that everything is at the same even level of polish.

205
00:10:05,943 --> 00:10:09,664
As a whole, it will be cohesive. And use the tools you have.

206
00:10:09,904 --> 00:10:12,844
For example, use key pairs instead of stepped animation.

207
00:10:13,104 --> 00:10:16,685
In an emergency, you can ship a blocked out splined animation, but you can't ship a

208
00:10:16,705 --> 00:10:19,566
skipped one. You can also use animation layers and

209
00:10:19,606 --> 00:10:21,586
state graph to create new animations quickly.

210
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:24,708
And speaking of state graphs, use them.

211
00:10:25,369 --> 00:10:27,531
Being able to set up and integrate your own animations

212
00:10:27,631 --> 00:10:30,553
is so powerful and allows you to get your things in the game

213
00:10:30,593 --> 00:10:31,914
faster and test them yourself.

214
00:10:32,535 --> 00:10:34,396
Waiting on engineering to integrate animations

215
00:10:34,476 --> 00:10:36,919
is frustrating and often just bottlenecks to the process.

216
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:38,600
And about engineers.

217
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,080
bug them for tools to help you.

218
00:10:41,681 --> 00:10:43,962
If you have an idea for a tool that will save you time,

219
00:10:44,382 --> 00:10:46,543
then talk to your lead or talk to engineering directly

220
00:10:46,603 --> 00:10:47,144
if you can.

221
00:10:47,904 --> 00:10:49,505
Often something that will take them an hour

222
00:10:49,545 --> 00:10:51,226
will save you days worth of frustration.

223
00:10:51,806 --> 00:10:52,987
Your time is important too,

224
00:10:53,427 --> 00:10:55,348
so work with your team to make your job easier.

225
00:10:55,909 --> 00:10:56,909
And speaking of your team,

226
00:10:57,489 --> 00:11:00,211
when somebody comes at you with an unrealistic request

227
00:11:00,231 --> 00:11:02,452
that'll blow out your schedule, push back.

228
00:11:02,892 --> 00:11:03,973
You're a team member too,

229
00:11:04,754 --> 00:11:06,434
and your time and opinion is important.

230
00:11:06,995 --> 00:11:08,855
Offer solutions and find a middle ground that's

231
00:11:08,895 --> 00:11:11,156
appropriate for your timeline and your team size.

232
00:11:11,896 --> 00:11:13,997
And if you know you have a difficult task before you,

233
00:11:14,237 --> 00:11:14,817
don't panic.

234
00:11:15,317 --> 00:11:17,358
Make a realistic plan and execute.

235
00:11:17,798 --> 00:11:19,178
Go in with a clear creative vision

236
00:11:19,238 --> 00:11:21,099
and identify, prioritize, and focus

237
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:23,700
on what's most meaningful for the game and the player.

238
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,100
If you've achieved that, then that's a success,

239
00:11:26,381 --> 00:11:28,441
even if you're shipping with some unpolished animation.

240
00:11:28,461 --> 00:11:31,342
And as a final note, putting your best effort

241
00:11:31,422 --> 00:11:34,003
but not being able to finish things to a perfect polish

242
00:11:34,103 --> 00:11:36,063
is not a reflection on you as a person.

243
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,501
A lot of the time, that unfinished animation is only imperfect to you.

244
00:11:40,761 --> 00:11:42,822
To everyone else, the animation is finished.

245
00:11:44,242 --> 00:11:47,944
And remember, you can always go back and polish your favorite animations for your demo reel

246
00:11:47,984 --> 00:11:48,264
later.

247
00:11:48,664 --> 00:11:49,304
Thanks everyone!

248
00:11:49,484 --> 00:11:52,566
I'm Kristen, and you can find me at At Stuff by Kristen on Twitter.

249
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:04,408
Hi, everybody.

250
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:08,250
My name is Yusef Cole, and I'm from the Bronx, New York.

251
00:12:09,191 --> 00:12:11,072
And this is the home page of my website.

252
00:12:11,552 --> 00:12:13,853
There's a reason that it looks like a bad choose

253
00:12:13,873 --> 00:12:14,634
your own adventure game.

254
00:12:15,594 --> 00:12:17,715
It's because I claim very two different lines of work

255
00:12:17,936 --> 00:12:18,876
as my profession.

256
00:12:21,257 --> 00:12:25,560
Hold on a second.

257
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,260
It just broke.

258
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:28,642
Let's try that again.

259
00:12:31,112 --> 00:12:37,396
I am a motion graphics animator, and I specialize in software like Adobe After Effects and Cinema

260
00:12:37,436 --> 00:12:37,636
4D.

261
00:12:38,356 --> 00:12:42,839
I animate shapes and typography for 2D screens, and I've been doing that for over a decade.

262
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:46,661
I've worked on projects for companies like Facebook, Nike, and so on.

263
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,262
And I'm also a freelance games critic.

264
00:12:49,342 --> 00:12:51,443
I write essays about video games where I try and dig into

265
00:12:51,503 --> 00:12:54,125
unexplored themes and how they reflect politics

266
00:12:54,165 --> 00:12:55,645
and history in the world.

267
00:12:56,226 --> 00:12:58,347
I've written for sites like Waypoint, Pace, Unwinnable,

268
00:12:58,507 --> 00:13:01,969
and ZAM, which brings me to what I'm gonna talk about today.

269
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:03,629
Picking passions.

270
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,552
For years, I've done motion graphics as my main gig

271
00:13:07,612 --> 00:13:09,172
and picked up freelance writing on the side.

272
00:13:09,713 --> 00:13:09,933
Why?

273
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,514
Because as interesting as the process of animation can be,

274
00:13:12,994 --> 00:13:14,455
a lot of the jobs I've taken haven't been

275
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:15,976
that intellectually stimulating.

276
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,878
There's a lot of creative potential in motion graphics,

277
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:22,380
but the content is usually a little hard to care about.

278
00:13:22,941 --> 00:13:24,362
Snowflakes for a car commercial,

279
00:13:25,162 --> 00:13:27,424
animating cute mascots for health insurance companies,

280
00:13:27,444 --> 00:13:29,946
helping a social media network apologize for being shitty

281
00:13:29,986 --> 00:13:31,668
before they then go on to be even more shitty.

282
00:13:35,394 --> 00:13:37,497
So in August I started working as the head of animation

283
00:13:37,537 --> 00:13:38,919
at Patriot Act with Asad Minhaj.

284
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:42,083
And this is a show, it's the first time in many years

285
00:13:42,163 --> 00:13:44,466
that I felt truly invested in the end product

286
00:13:45,127 --> 00:13:46,048
and the content I'm making.

287
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:47,611
I get to work with fun, brilliant people

288
00:13:47,691 --> 00:13:48,993
coming up with fascinating topics

289
00:13:49,013 --> 00:13:49,954
that I actually care about.

290
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,942
And this presents a problem for my side hustle, writing.

291
00:13:54,062 --> 00:13:56,383
On many of my previous gigs, I was able to take weeks off

292
00:13:56,423 --> 00:13:57,984
for research, brainstorming, and pitching.

293
00:13:58,184 --> 00:13:59,504
Now my time is super compressed.

294
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:03,166
We make an episode a week from this start.

295
00:14:03,646 --> 00:14:05,167
So I can't give this job just 75%.

296
00:14:05,307 --> 00:14:07,368
But I still love to write.

297
00:14:07,468 --> 00:14:09,389
So I've spent the past few months wrestling

298
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:10,610
with how exactly to do that.

299
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,631
That means squeezing in my passion projects where I can,

300
00:14:13,691 --> 00:14:15,672
like on the train before work, writing at night

301
00:14:15,712 --> 00:14:17,953
before passing out, waking up early to write,

302
00:14:18,473 --> 00:14:19,734
never going to the gym ever.

303
00:14:22,405 --> 00:14:24,427
Of course, there are some limitations to these methods.

304
00:14:24,787 --> 00:14:26,449
Trying to finish an essay on my phone

305
00:14:26,469 --> 00:14:27,510
in the middle of rush hour,

306
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,972
not getting to spend time with my partner or my cats

307
00:14:30,132 --> 00:14:32,434
after work, being perpetually sleep deprived,

308
00:14:33,134 --> 00:14:34,456
never going to the gym ever.

309
00:14:34,476 --> 00:14:39,680
There's gotta be a better way.

310
00:14:40,401 --> 00:14:42,062
A lot of the friction comes from trying to do

311
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:43,904
two totally different things at once.

312
00:14:44,544 --> 00:14:46,846
It's really hard sometimes to switch gears in the brain,

313
00:14:47,126 --> 00:14:49,729
especially when one of those gears is huge and overwhelming

314
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:51,030
and sucks up all of your time.

315
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:59,639
Here's how I attempt to invest both in writing unique, challenging essays and engaging more

316
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:01,160
fully in the creative process of the show.

317
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:05,362
If I remember to turn off my animator brain and to turn on my writer brain, I can apply

318
00:15:05,422 --> 00:15:10,104
the ideas we came up with for the show as inspiration for my own work in the future.

319
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:14,706
So I think Karl Marx may have been onto something when he told workers to seize the means of

320
00:15:14,746 --> 00:15:15,187
production.

321
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:18,968
What I mean in my case is how do you take something that doesn't belong to you, your

322
00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:22,570
labor and your time on a job, and make it work for your own interests.

323
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,413
So some background.

324
00:15:26,513 --> 00:15:28,114
I enjoy writing about culture and politics

325
00:15:28,174 --> 00:15:29,496
and how they intersect with games.

326
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:32,418
Some examples are for Unwinnable,

327
00:15:32,478 --> 00:15:34,761
I wrote about Cuphead and the racism

328
00:15:34,781 --> 00:15:36,903
of the 1930s cartoons that inspired it.

329
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,205
I was able to dig into the history of minstrelsy

330
00:15:39,285 --> 00:15:42,067
and American entertainment for this essay.

331
00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:44,410
For Waypoint, I wrote about Detroit Become Human,

332
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,231
and I talked about the game's questionable analogy

333
00:15:46,271 --> 00:15:48,394
between race, labor, and fictional androids.

334
00:15:49,154 --> 00:15:53,156
I also talked about how the studio itself, Quantic Dream, is also plagued by labor issues

335
00:15:53,196 --> 00:15:55,938
and how that knowledge infects the messages trying to get across.

336
00:15:55,958 --> 00:16:02,541
So both of these essays were deep historical dives which required a lot of time spent on

337
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:03,021
research.

338
00:16:03,621 --> 00:16:05,382
I don't really have that time anymore.

339
00:16:07,503 --> 00:16:10,965
Luckily, Patriot Act is a show about historical deep dives, though, so the solution to my

340
00:16:11,005 --> 00:16:14,747
lack of time then is to allow my main hustle to work for my side one.

341
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,021
Here are four of the episodes, some of the episodes

342
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,462
that we've done so far on the show.

343
00:16:19,762 --> 00:16:22,644
One is about student loans, one's on Amazon, Supreme,

344
00:16:22,984 --> 00:16:23,685
and Saudi Arabia.

345
00:16:24,565 --> 00:16:25,866
Without spending too much extra time,

346
00:16:26,106 --> 00:16:27,667
I can generate some really interesting pitches

347
00:16:27,747 --> 00:16:28,828
off of each of these subjects.

348
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,089
Is it worth going to school for e-sports for student loans?

349
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,791
How scarcity culture affects the value of rare old games

350
00:16:35,831 --> 00:16:36,452
for Supreme?

351
00:16:36,732 --> 00:16:39,134
What Amazon's history of cannibalizing its competitors

352
00:16:39,174 --> 00:16:42,076
means for its game publisher and games in the Arab world

353
00:16:42,136 --> 00:16:43,758
and youth culture in modern Saudi Arabia.

354
00:16:43,778 --> 00:16:46,980
I haven't written any of these yet, so you guys are free to.

355
00:16:48,121 --> 00:16:52,327
One of the most important practices of a games critic is looking outside of games for inspiration.

356
00:16:52,727 --> 00:16:56,812
Rather than seeing my day job as a slog, something that doesn't apply at all to writing,

357
00:16:57,173 --> 00:17:00,918
I now see it as a creative goldmine with plenty of excess ideas and energy spilling out.

358
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:06,791
I'm daily inspired by being on a creative job that thankfully seems to have a lot of

359
00:17:06,811 --> 00:17:07,952
parallels with my side hustle.

360
00:17:08,592 --> 00:17:10,493
But the kind of job you have shouldn't matter.

361
00:17:10,534 --> 00:17:13,636
The key is finding the right similarities and learning how to make wildly different

362
00:17:13,656 --> 00:17:14,756
disciplines inform each other.

363
00:17:15,177 --> 00:17:17,398
The result can be something greater than the sum of its parts.

364
00:17:18,979 --> 00:17:19,720
Am I still tired?

365
00:17:20,461 --> 00:17:20,641
Yes.

366
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,901
Time will never be on my side.

367
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,823
I still have to write in the mornings and on the train

368
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:25,504
and on the weekends.

369
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:28,487
But it's something I love to do and I will always love doing.

370
00:17:28,527 --> 00:17:31,490
So I'm glad that I found a way to not only make it work

371
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,113
with my day job, but to make my day job work for it.

372
00:17:34,934 --> 00:17:35,214
Thank you.

373
00:17:45,728 --> 00:17:46,428
Hello, world.

374
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:50,130
So I am Heather Alexandra McIntyre.

375
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:53,211
I am a staff writer for Kotaku.com, a video game

376
00:17:53,231 --> 00:17:54,232
website about video games.

377
00:17:54,772 --> 00:17:58,634
And I have never made a PowerPoint since high school.

378
00:17:59,014 --> 00:18:00,975
So here we go.

379
00:18:00,995 --> 00:18:03,016
So we're talking about creative voice today.

380
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:06,257
And sometimes that means looking at games from perspectives

381
00:18:06,277 --> 00:18:08,278
that we might not have considered them before.

382
00:18:08,318 --> 00:18:09,519
So I want to kind of go through what

383
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,280
that might look like for a very specific thing in this case.

384
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,080
In this case, it's.

385
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:19,831
idle animations, I'm just gonna start with what's basically my thesis once the slide moves forward,

386
00:18:19,911 --> 00:18:26,256
but the idea is that even the smallest things inside games that we love have really, really

387
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:33,282
strange and large implications that we need to examine. Lana, is this slide not moving?

388
00:18:33,302 --> 00:18:39,287
I told you at the start of what I was talking about. Is it moving?

389
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:40,950
There we go.

390
00:18:41,431 --> 00:18:42,452
So what's the big deal here?

391
00:18:42,472 --> 00:18:43,913
So I'm gonna talk about idle animation.

392
00:18:43,953 --> 00:18:44,434
So let's go.

393
00:18:44,814 --> 00:18:45,755
So the goals of players

394
00:18:45,775 --> 00:18:48,157
and the goals of fictional characters often align,

395
00:18:48,297 --> 00:18:51,120
but there are times when players exert control over actors

396
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,842
and subvert their wants or desires.

397
00:18:53,543 --> 00:18:54,584
Idle animations are places

398
00:18:54,604 --> 00:18:56,265
where they're free from player tyranny.

399
00:18:56,566 --> 00:18:57,326
We will get into that.

400
00:18:57,827 --> 00:18:59,829
And you should treat them as these very special places.

401
00:18:59,869 --> 00:19:01,230
So video game characters

402
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,432
are many different things at once.

403
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:04,554
This is Sora from Kingdom Hearts on the left.

404
00:19:05,094 --> 00:19:07,216
He's in gameplay on the right, he's in a cut scene.

405
00:19:07,957 --> 00:19:09,078
Video game characters exist

406
00:19:09,118 --> 00:19:11,320
between very specific dipole states.

407
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:15,464
They're being tugged between two things at any given point,

408
00:19:15,504 --> 00:19:16,785
and we should define what those things are.

409
00:19:17,345 --> 00:19:19,347
They are both actors, by which I mean

410
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:22,370
that they are controllable persona manipulated by players,

411
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,991
and they're characters, by which I mean

412
00:19:24,552 --> 00:19:25,713
individuals within a fiction,

413
00:19:25,773 --> 00:19:27,935
but also like people in a world,

414
00:19:28,015 --> 00:19:30,077
and we need to start treating them like actual people.

415
00:19:31,318 --> 00:19:35,260
Because they're being pulled in these two different directions, there's conflict though.

416
00:19:35,961 --> 00:19:40,103
What Raiden wants as a character in Metal Gear Solid 2 is incredibly different than what a

417
00:19:40,303 --> 00:19:45,727
player might want for Raiden at any given time. And because video game characters are fulfilling

418
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:50,089
two roles, it's a problem. Here's an example of that. On the left, there is a YouTuber who

419
00:19:50,129 --> 00:19:54,272
is making a compilation video of all the death animations in Resident Evil 2.

420
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:57,695
The objective here for the actor is to die over and over.

421
00:19:58,115 --> 00:20:00,337
Claire Redfield's objective as a character is to live.

422
00:20:00,417 --> 00:20:02,719
These two things are not compatible. That's super screwed up.

423
00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:05,421
But, good news, these two things can align.

424
00:20:06,042 --> 00:20:09,284
Solid Snake wants to sneak through a base, and he wants to complete his mission.

425
00:20:09,445 --> 00:20:13,188
The player wants to not get spotted and get the highest rank at the end of the game. Great.

426
00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:14,929
Things are in alignment.

427
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:18,312
But we need to be careful because players are tyrants.

428
00:20:19,072 --> 00:20:20,834
I know we're supposed to say like,

429
00:20:20,874 --> 00:20:21,874
players are the best in everything,

430
00:20:21,914 --> 00:20:23,836
but players scare the shit out of me.

431
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:26,458
They control everything about video game worlds.

432
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:28,399
They can make these people, and I mean it,

433
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:31,021
these people do things that they do not want to do.

434
00:20:31,782 --> 00:20:38,444
The implications of that are very scary. I think video game characters want freedom and thankfully there are places where they get it. Thankfully, yes.

435
00:20:39,524 --> 00:20:45,946
Cutscenes is one place where they actually get to act as entities solely within their fictional world, by which I mean they just get to be people.

436
00:20:46,006 --> 00:20:50,568
And then idle animations where they finally get to express, just for a moment, a little autonomy.

437
00:20:51,088 --> 00:20:52,308
This is Sonic the Hedgehog.

438
00:20:52,368 --> 00:20:53,929
This is very well-known idle animation.

439
00:20:54,389 --> 00:20:57,249
This thing expresses a very specific tension.

440
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,630
Sonic the Hedgehog's objective is clear here right now.

441
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,891
He wants to move, but the player is a tyrant,

442
00:21:03,311 --> 00:21:04,911
and they are not pushing buttons on the controller,

443
00:21:04,991 --> 00:21:07,632
and so therefore we don't just learn something

444
00:21:07,672 --> 00:21:09,312
about Sonic the Hedgehog's personality

445
00:21:09,392 --> 00:21:10,452
because of that idle animation,

446
00:21:10,472 --> 00:21:11,953
because look at him, he's a nice, fun guy.

447
00:21:11,993 --> 00:21:13,933
He's like, oh, his buddies are smiling or whatever,

448
00:21:14,393 --> 00:21:17,114
but also that animation starts to express something

449
00:21:17,154 --> 00:21:19,314
about Sonic and his actual relationship

450
00:21:19,354 --> 00:21:20,435
to us and players.

451
00:21:21,435 --> 00:21:25,860
which is to say, you know, Arthur Morgan goes into town and he shoots like 50 people

452
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,262
because the player's like, I'm just going to be rooting, tooting and shooting.

453
00:21:29,343 --> 00:21:33,948
But then when they stop, Arthur shakes out his hand when he's on his horse.

454
00:21:34,308 --> 00:21:35,970
That moment is beautiful to me.

455
00:21:36,951 --> 00:21:40,573
It's the moment where Arthur gets to exhale finally after being controlled.

456
00:21:41,253 --> 00:21:46,777
Sometimes Arthur Morgan will pet his horse and in these moments we can ask us like questions like, what does Arthur Morgan value?

457
00:21:46,817 --> 00:21:52,760
But we should also be asking what does Arthur do and what does he value before the player asserts control over him as an actor?

458
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,482
Those are the things I want to see when I return to Arthur.

459
00:21:56,242 --> 00:21:57,343
Because small moments aren't.

460
00:21:58,464 --> 00:22:04,627
these people, these entities are being controlled constantly by players, by tyrannical people. And so

461
00:22:05,067 --> 00:22:09,869
the moments where they get to even express a tiny moment of themselves, even though those things are

462
00:22:09,889 --> 00:22:15,172
being crafted by us, are important. This can happen in gameplay too. Here Mario is skidding.

463
00:22:15,212 --> 00:22:19,494
This is not just about game feel. It's not just about having good platforming mechanics.

464
00:22:20,134 --> 00:22:25,337
This is a moment where I'm reminded that Mario is a person in a place with weight and validity,

465
00:22:25,557 --> 00:22:29,418
and that's really, really cool. Tracer is reloading her guns. Oh, wow, how flashy.

466
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,280
Those Blizzard animations are really great, aren't they, Lana?

467
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:38,763
But also, you can kind of cancel this animation by hitting melee,

468
00:22:38,823 --> 00:22:42,304
but otherwise I will suggest to you that this is a moment where Tracer is free.

469
00:22:43,485 --> 00:22:48,068
Good news, even better news, you can bake some of this knowledge into your mechanics.

470
00:22:48,128 --> 00:22:52,310
So Arthur values his horse a lot, but we get a chance to pet Arthur's horse too,

471
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:56,993
because if Arthur values it, we should probably give players a chance to value those things too.

472
00:22:57,493 --> 00:22:59,915
If Arthur values it enough to do it by himself,

473
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:03,977
bridge that gap and allow your players to do it with Arthur, because empathy is key.

474
00:23:04,437 --> 00:23:07,119
You need to be treating the people that you are animating as people.

475
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,620
I keep on saying people because I mean it. These are entities.

476
00:23:10,661 --> 00:23:16,004
And if you start to find the moments in your games where people can break away, that's great.

477
00:23:16,064 --> 00:23:21,166
There are exceptions to this, like digital worlds are a huge exception because the bodies that we inhabit in digital worlds

478
00:23:21,827 --> 00:23:23,968
tend to be a little bit more like extensions of our limbs.

479
00:23:24,548 --> 00:23:29,491
So we get to sort of define the poses and idle animations in there, but otherwise...

480
00:23:30,331 --> 00:23:33,993
Find the moments where your characters can break free from player tyranny and emphasize them.

481
00:23:34,874 --> 00:23:39,317
You won't just have moments where your characters find relief, your players will find relief with

482
00:23:39,337 --> 00:23:42,899
your characters and your games will be kinder. And I think that's something we all need right

483
00:23:42,939 --> 00:23:46,041
now in this world is just a little bit of kindness. So there you go.

484
00:23:57,613 --> 00:23:58,173
Howdy, everybody.

485
00:23:58,313 --> 00:24:00,555
My name's Brandon Nason and I'm a 3D animator

486
00:24:00,595 --> 00:24:01,756
currently working at Pocket Gems,

487
00:24:01,796 --> 00:24:03,397
a mobile gaming company based here in the city.

488
00:24:03,437 --> 00:24:04,778
It's about three blocks that way.

489
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:06,619
After nearly three years of development,

490
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:08,680
we recently released our newest title,

491
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,821
Wild Beyond, late last year,

492
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:11,282
and I'm now assisting with the creation

493
00:24:11,462 --> 00:24:13,403
of new assets for the live product.

494
00:24:13,944 --> 00:24:15,164
So by profession, I'm an animator,

495
00:24:15,285 --> 00:24:16,645
but I'm also a landscape photographer.

496
00:24:16,766 --> 00:24:17,766
I'm a Spartan racer,

497
00:24:18,086 --> 00:24:20,248
I'm a leader of a nearly undefeated escape room group,

498
00:24:20,408 --> 00:24:21,589
and I'm a very lucky boyfriend.

499
00:24:22,229 --> 00:24:25,111
Now, you're probably asking yourself, why is this guy up here sharing these personal

500
00:24:25,151 --> 00:24:28,414
details with you at a talk that's supposed to be about game development?

501
00:24:28,794 --> 00:24:32,477
Because I believe that having a robust and enriching personal life outside the walls

502
00:24:32,517 --> 00:24:35,580
of the studio can help you be a better game developer and artist.

503
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,322
I believe that our industry always has had this problem, finding the proper work-life

504
00:24:39,362 --> 00:24:42,325
balance for its developers, and I'm up here today to make the case of why it's absolutely

505
00:24:42,385 --> 00:24:44,026
vital that we keep this relevant in our community.

506
00:24:44,727 --> 00:24:47,988
I believe there's a little bit of a sickness within our community where having a personal

507
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:51,650
life is at best seen as a nice perk and at the very worst a weakness.

508
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:56,512
There are vast creative and emotional benefits for balancing personal and professional priorities

509
00:24:56,632 --> 00:24:58,753
and I would like to go over a few of those with you today.

510
00:24:59,652 --> 00:25:03,154
I think that we often get a little wrapped up in finding reference and tree animation

511
00:25:03,194 --> 00:25:04,796
a little bit too cerebrally sometimes.

512
00:25:05,276 --> 00:25:09,880
We count frames, we analyze spacing, and we make these really embarrassing reference videos,

513
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:14,223
and we try our damnedest to get these massive tangles of sign waste to somehow create life.

514
00:25:14,924 --> 00:25:16,525
But animators are also actors.

515
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:18,707
Need to animate a character falling in love?

516
00:25:18,887 --> 00:25:21,529
Yeah, of course you can find a reference video on YouTube

517
00:25:21,709 --> 00:25:22,991
about somebody falling in love.

518
00:25:23,331 --> 00:25:25,172
But how much more well-informed would your decisions

519
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,654
and acting choices be if you'd actually

520
00:25:26,674 --> 00:25:27,574
gone through that experience?

521
00:25:28,075 --> 00:25:30,757
I believe that living boldly and seeking out new experiences

522
00:25:30,817 --> 00:25:32,559
will help you develop a creative catalog

523
00:25:32,579 --> 00:25:33,800
that you can draw upon while animating.

524
00:25:34,721 --> 00:25:36,163
It also works for the physical realm.

525
00:25:36,563 --> 00:25:37,725
Does a character need to rock climb?

526
00:25:38,005 --> 00:25:39,487
Again, you can find video reference

527
00:25:39,547 --> 00:25:40,729
of the physical mechanics of that.

528
00:25:41,149 --> 00:25:42,671
But if you go rock climbing yourself

529
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:45,054
and experience the adrenaline rush and the muscle fatigue

530
00:25:45,175 --> 00:25:46,997
when you get up to the top of the wall and you look down,

531
00:25:47,317 --> 00:25:49,240
you'll be able to animate with far more fidelity.

532
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:49,981
You'll feel it.

533
00:25:51,102 --> 00:25:57,167
I run Spartan races with my friends for fun, and I can't tell you how well that's informed my understanding of the physicality of body movement and weight.

534
00:25:57,447 --> 00:26:00,870
Have you guys ever jumped over a fire, climbed a rope, thrown a spear?

535
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:04,833
Those are experiences that you'll never forget and help me each and every time I animate.

536
00:26:05,393 --> 00:26:06,975
Now, why is that important?

537
00:26:07,415 --> 00:26:15,181
I believe that knowledge gained from real-world experiences like these can elevate your animation from something that is merely functional to something truly artistic and nuanced.

538
00:26:16,512 --> 00:26:19,574
That type of knowledge cannot be gained from sitting in front of your computer stuck in

539
00:26:19,794 --> 00:26:21,215
the office crunching to meet a deadline.

540
00:26:21,876 --> 00:26:26,299
So let's take a moment to talk about the emotional benefits of prioritizing your personal life.

541
00:26:27,139 --> 00:26:29,001
So animating professionally can be grueling.

542
00:26:29,401 --> 00:26:32,984
As amazing as this feeling as a career in animation can be, it often comes with a price.

543
00:26:33,484 --> 00:26:36,847
We've all heard the horror stories, the rumors, even the news reports, especially over the

544
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:37,527
last couple of years.

545
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:43,669
endless crunch, low pay, living contact to contract with no stability and enormous economic

546
00:26:43,849 --> 00:26:46,092
anxiety, substance abuse, even divorce.

547
00:26:46,533 --> 00:26:49,997
If you aren't personally experiencing these aspects of our industry, you assuredly know

548
00:26:50,017 --> 00:26:50,678
somebody who has.

549
00:26:51,139 --> 00:26:55,545
Our passion drives us to work hard, sometimes with such force and fervor that burnout is

550
00:26:55,585 --> 00:26:56,005
inevitable.

551
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:58,507
For the record, I consider myself extremely fortunate

552
00:26:58,527 --> 00:27:00,809
to have found a company that values the employees enough

553
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,270
to make work-life balance a priority.

554
00:27:02,451 --> 00:27:04,452
I know, however, that I'm the minority on this issue.

555
00:27:04,853 --> 00:27:06,834
But for those of you who have to deal with some,

556
00:27:06,874 --> 00:27:08,055
if not all, of the problems I listed,

557
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:10,437
I would highly recommend putting the time and effort

558
00:27:10,457 --> 00:27:11,618
into cultivating your friendships.

559
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:14,981
I mean, just being able to go home in a rage

560
00:27:15,021 --> 00:27:16,282
when things aren't going well at work,

561
00:27:16,582 --> 00:27:18,003
to commiserate and even problem solve

562
00:27:18,023 --> 00:27:19,124
with people that love and care

563
00:27:19,164 --> 00:27:21,606
about your personal well-being is extremely important,

564
00:27:21,666 --> 00:27:22,967
especially during times like crunch.

565
00:27:23,307 --> 00:27:24,988
I know I've had to experience that from time to time.

566
00:27:25,846 --> 00:27:27,827
When you're sitting in front of that monitor,

567
00:27:27,987 --> 00:27:29,228
bleary-eyed from lack of sleep,

568
00:27:29,428 --> 00:27:30,769
eyes shifting up to the clock on the wall,

569
00:27:30,809 --> 00:27:31,870
dreading that looming deadline,

570
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,312
just knowing that you're not alone in the world

571
00:27:34,392 --> 00:27:36,433
and that there are people out there that believe in you

572
00:27:36,834 --> 00:27:39,035
can be the proverbial thing that keeps you afloat.

573
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:42,057
Both creativity and passion are not ever-flowing springs.

574
00:27:42,337 --> 00:27:43,198
They're more like buckets,

575
00:27:43,538 --> 00:27:44,959
pushed you hard and for too long,

576
00:27:45,019 --> 00:27:47,461
and those buckets can empty or even start to develop holes.

577
00:27:47,881 --> 00:27:49,002
It's important to have the self-knowledge

578
00:27:49,022 --> 00:27:51,303
that allows you to know what refills those creative reservoirs

579
00:27:51,344 --> 00:27:52,524
and to give yourself enough time

580
00:27:52,845 --> 00:27:54,726
for you to fill them back up outside of work.

581
00:27:55,368 --> 00:27:59,771
For me, planning on going on adventures gives me something to look forward to, which is

582
00:27:59,871 --> 00:28:00,492
always nice.

583
00:28:00,852 --> 00:28:04,215
Traveling the world and seeing new places with friends and loved ones leaves me refreshed

584
00:28:04,255 --> 00:28:05,196
and ready to get back to work.

585
00:28:06,617 --> 00:28:10,260
It can be different for everybody, but I challenge you to go and find your passion, find your

586
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,441
inspiration, and give yourself the time to enjoy it.

587
00:28:13,893 --> 00:28:17,134
Being emotionally and creatively healthy makes you a better animator and an employee.

588
00:28:17,314 --> 00:28:18,335
Who's going to do a better job?

589
00:28:18,515 --> 00:28:20,015
The walking zombie of a human being?

590
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:21,516
Sleep-deprived and burned out?

591
00:28:21,736 --> 00:28:25,577
Or a well-rested animator fresh off a weekend spent doing what they love with friends and family?

592
00:28:26,397 --> 00:28:29,318
Creativity requires inspiration, epiphany, and hard work.

593
00:28:29,578 --> 00:28:32,139
It also requires the state of mind to be receptive to those things.

594
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:36,123
Remember that at the end of the day, in spite of all the various programs we interface with

595
00:28:36,203 --> 00:28:39,867
and the professional obstacles that we must navigate, we are artists first and foremost,

596
00:28:39,907 --> 00:28:43,550
and as such we thrive off inspiration and personal experiences just like any other

597
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:48,115
artistic discipline. Note too that we are all only human and that we need some recovery time

598
00:28:48,135 --> 00:28:51,318
and the solidarity of friends and family to get us through the tough times.

599
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:54,100
Each and every one of us only has this one life to live.

600
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,522
Jobs will come and go, your work will ebb and flow,

601
00:28:56,962 --> 00:28:59,584
but your personal relationships and emotional and creative health last forever.

602
00:28:59,944 --> 00:29:03,607
So get out there, make friends, call your mom, experience life,

603
00:29:04,067 --> 00:29:06,048
and above all else, make sure you take care of yourself.

604
00:29:06,168 --> 00:29:08,090
You'll only be a better artist and game developer if you do.

605
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:08,750
Thank you.

606
00:29:20,998 --> 00:29:22,699
I call my mom, she's going to like that.

607
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:25,121
All right.

608
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:27,002
I was told to put this under my chin.

609
00:29:27,022 --> 00:29:28,803
Is that working?

610
00:29:29,143 --> 00:29:30,204
Hi, my name's Gwen.

611
00:29:30,284 --> 00:29:31,785
I love this room.

612
00:29:32,045 --> 00:29:32,585
My name's Gwen.

613
00:29:32,806 --> 00:29:33,426
I'm an animator.

614
00:29:33,526 --> 00:29:34,387
I'm an indie developer.

615
00:29:34,827 --> 00:29:36,948
And the theme of this talk this year is creative voice.

616
00:29:37,028 --> 00:29:38,769
So let's talk about how to be creative.

617
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:41,871
Let's talk about how do you actually be creative.

618
00:29:42,554 --> 00:29:44,374
Science has already figured this out, thankfully.

619
00:29:44,734 --> 00:29:47,436
It turns out that the way you be more creative

620
00:29:47,476 --> 00:29:48,316
is to have constraints.

621
00:29:48,376 --> 00:29:50,417
It turns out that having limited resources

622
00:29:50,777 --> 00:29:52,058
forces your brain to work different

623
00:29:52,098 --> 00:29:54,539
and will actually make you more creative, which is good,

624
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,500
because we have a lot of constraints in this industry.

625
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,921
We have constraints on bone counts, on frame counts,

626
00:29:58,961 --> 00:29:59,721
on all sorts of things.

627
00:30:00,121 --> 00:30:01,102
These talks are ridiculous.

628
00:30:01,142 --> 00:30:02,562
I have constraints for this talk, right?

629
00:30:03,103 --> 00:30:04,243
I have 20 slides.

630
00:30:04,683 --> 00:30:07,485
The talk auto-advances after 16 seconds on each slide.

631
00:30:07,905 --> 00:30:10,207
I have to work within these ridiculous technical constraints.

632
00:30:10,428 --> 00:30:11,729
And I have other things too, right?

633
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:13,250
Like I've got constraints on my tone.

634
00:30:13,691 --> 00:30:15,733
Because I give this talk, I've given it several times,

635
00:30:15,793 --> 00:30:18,616
and every year I do like kind of maybe a quirky, funny sort of talk.

636
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:22,692
So now I've got an audience built up, and they expect me to do a talk like that.

637
00:30:22,772 --> 00:30:25,533
And if I do something different, my audience will be mad about it.

638
00:30:25,553 --> 00:30:26,813
Well, they just won't like it as much.

639
00:30:27,314 --> 00:30:29,814
And then I have this other audience, just people in this room, right?

640
00:30:30,015 --> 00:30:31,915
Like, look around. Everybody here is an animator.

641
00:30:32,395 --> 00:30:33,536
You want to hear about animation.

642
00:30:34,036 --> 00:30:38,257
You don't want to hear about, like, my book club, or Lana's haircut, or design, or comedy.

643
00:30:38,357 --> 00:30:39,337
You want to hear about animation.

644
00:30:39,377 --> 00:30:40,578
It's why you're here, right?

645
00:30:41,118 --> 00:30:42,758
So I have to figure out what you guys want,

646
00:30:42,778 --> 00:30:45,279
which is easy, because you fill out evaluations every year.

647
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:47,380
You fill out those evaluation forms, right?

648
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,760
And what you guys like is,

649
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,441
anytime you have a takeaway, technical talks,

650
00:30:51,521 --> 00:30:52,461
things where you have something

651
00:30:52,481 --> 00:30:54,662
that you can take back to your studio and use, right?

652
00:30:54,742 --> 00:30:55,182
We know this.

653
00:30:55,242 --> 00:30:56,602
You fill out the forms and tell us this.

654
00:30:57,203 --> 00:30:58,603
But in spite of this, every year,

655
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:00,143
Lana, the person who runs this, says,

656
00:31:00,564 --> 00:31:01,964
no, no, no, not for the micro talks.

657
00:31:02,684 --> 00:31:03,364
This is different.

658
00:31:03,644 --> 00:31:04,745
This is gonna be about culture.

659
00:31:04,765 --> 00:31:06,425
It's gonna be about feelings, right?

660
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:08,559
This is how we end the day.

661
00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:09,759
We're gonna do something cathartic.

662
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:10,820
We're gonna inspire people.

663
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,841
We're gonna do something really different.

664
00:31:13,181 --> 00:31:15,021
My creative director is a whack job

665
00:31:15,302 --> 00:31:17,422
who has a different idea for what this should be

666
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:19,723
than the market, which is also different

667
00:31:19,803 --> 00:31:22,264
from what, honestly, what I care about.

668
00:31:22,445 --> 00:31:23,425
If you really break it down

669
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:24,565
and you look at what I care about,

670
00:31:24,946 --> 00:31:25,926
all I care about is this.

671
00:31:26,026 --> 00:31:26,966
This is my indie game.

672
00:31:27,587 --> 00:31:29,990
I spent my nights and weekends working on it.

673
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:32,855
I quit my job at the end of last year and I got it funded.

674
00:31:33,456 --> 00:31:35,439
I've, it's going extremely well.

675
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:36,540
I've spun up a small team.

676
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,542
I'm bringing the game here.

677
00:31:37,582 --> 00:31:39,485
I'm showcasing this game that I've been working on

678
00:31:39,525 --> 00:31:41,207
for years in the Expo Hall.

679
00:31:41,645 --> 00:31:43,306
this year at GDC and I'm over the moon about it.

680
00:31:43,326 --> 00:31:44,387
It's all I think about, right?

681
00:31:44,947 --> 00:31:45,908
This is my baby.

682
00:31:46,348 --> 00:31:47,589
But it's not what you want to hear about.

683
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:50,111
You don't want somebody standing on stage marketing at you.

684
00:31:50,612 --> 00:31:51,112
I know that.

685
00:31:51,472 --> 00:31:53,734
What I care about, what's most important to me,

686
00:31:54,315 --> 00:31:56,296
and sometimes you're gonna experience this in your career,

687
00:31:56,376 --> 00:31:57,597
the thing that's most important to you

688
00:31:57,697 --> 00:31:59,739
isn't necessarily what your audience wants

689
00:32:00,339 --> 00:32:01,961
or what your creative director wants.

690
00:32:02,481 --> 00:32:06,647
a lot of times you're being pulled in a lot of different directions and it's difficult to marry

691
00:32:06,687 --> 00:32:10,854
them all, right? Like let's again just take a look at this talk. Like this talk has to be a little

692
00:32:10,874 --> 00:32:16,522
bit funny, it's got to be about culture, it's got to be about animation so that you guys are happy,

693
00:32:16,542 --> 00:32:18,425
it has to be about kind so that I'm happy.

694
00:32:20,378 --> 00:32:23,721
And a little bit, it's got to be about peanut butter.

695
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:27,926
And I know that's going to be, sound unusual, but I've got financial constraints and I just

696
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:28,987
need you to bear with me here, all right?

697
00:32:29,027 --> 00:32:33,051
Because I don't have a lot of money and I got this contract to promote peanut butter

698
00:32:33,191 --> 00:32:36,113
and I don't really need the contract, but if I don't take this contract this year, then

699
00:32:36,133 --> 00:32:38,656
I won't have one next year and I might really need that contract next year.

700
00:32:38,796 --> 00:32:41,278
And so I don't really have a lot of time to do this other stuff with the peanut butter,

701
00:32:41,298 --> 00:32:44,640
but I'm going to jam it in anyway. And why not? Because peanut butter is great.

702
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:48,562
Like, there's nothing wrong with peanut butter. I don't feel like a sellout by promoting peanut

703
00:32:48,582 --> 00:32:53,405
butter. I don't think that diminishes this talk at all. Peanut butter is delicious. I would have

704
00:32:53,445 --> 00:32:57,828
probably put the peanut butter stuff in here anyway. So anyway, if we're getting back to it,

705
00:32:58,289 --> 00:33:02,571
this talk is going to be a little bit funny. It's going to be about culture. It's going to

706
00:33:02,591 --> 00:33:06,954
be about animation. It's going to be about kind. And it's going to be a little bit about peanut

707
00:33:06,974 --> 00:33:07,615
butter, which is fine.

708
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:10,720
All right, here we go.

709
00:33:15,366 --> 00:33:15,907
This is kind.

710
00:33:16,287 --> 00:33:17,689
It features a lot of animation smears.

711
00:33:17,869 --> 00:33:19,531
So if you look here, you'll see I'm going forward.

712
00:33:19,925 --> 00:33:22,225
And then when I undo, the smears are even more exaggerated.

713
00:33:22,245 --> 00:33:23,305
I'm going to do it again right here.

714
00:33:23,465 --> 00:33:24,165
I'm going to move forward.

715
00:33:24,185 --> 00:33:25,406
And you see kind of a smear.

716
00:33:25,946 --> 00:33:27,606
And when I undo, you'll see it really exaggerated.

717
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:30,707
The way I achieve this is I create several cylinders.

718
00:33:31,447 --> 00:33:38,828
And I sketch traditional 2D smear frames on these cylinders.

719
00:33:38,928 --> 00:33:40,549
These cylinders are bound between two bones

720
00:33:40,589 --> 00:33:42,709
that I can kind of pull apart or orient

721
00:33:42,769 --> 00:33:45,669
how I need to in order to make a certain kind of a shape.

722
00:33:47,603 --> 00:33:50,185
When I start the effect, I spawn a cylinder.

723
00:33:50,205 --> 00:33:53,288
And the cylinder I choose is, basically I have to create

724
00:33:53,328 --> 00:33:54,970
a series of these for the ends of each character,

725
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,451
the extremities, and for the body.

726
00:33:56,932 --> 00:33:58,994
I create three cylinders for each one

727
00:33:59,074 --> 00:34:01,036
for the three different directions it could be pulling in.

728
00:34:01,176 --> 00:34:03,038
So here we're looking at the cylinders for the T shape.

729
00:34:04,259 --> 00:34:06,020
And in engine, I basically spawn this effect,

730
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,941
which spawns a cylinder.

731
00:34:06,981 --> 00:34:08,323
You see it?

732
00:34:11,386 --> 00:34:14,488
I leave one bone in world space, and I have the other bone

733
00:34:14,508 --> 00:34:15,929
attached to the end of the extremity.

734
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:17,990
I also have a couple bones in the middle that it will push

735
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,851
out sometimes if I need to make an arc like this.

736
00:34:21,132 --> 00:34:22,132
So that's the talk.

737
00:34:22,392 --> 00:34:24,254
And it had some constraints, all right?

738
00:34:24,334 --> 00:34:24,634
It's it.

739
00:34:26,415 --> 00:34:28,637
I mean, did those constraints make the talk better?

740
00:34:28,657 --> 00:34:29,458
I don't know.

741
00:34:29,698 --> 00:34:30,779
They made it more creative, though.

742
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:34,061
I think we can all agree that science is right.

743
00:34:34,522 --> 00:34:36,103
That talk was more creative because of it.

744
00:34:36,203 --> 00:34:37,204
And I think that's a good thing.

745
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:40,126
So if you're ever pulled, if you feel

746
00:34:40,146 --> 00:34:42,488
like you're being pulled in a lot of different directions

747
00:34:42,588 --> 00:34:44,709
by your director and different people at your studio,

748
00:34:44,769 --> 00:34:45,430
embrace that.

749
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:46,291
That's a good thing.

750
00:34:46,531 --> 00:34:48,412
That's going to make you more creative in the end.

751
00:34:49,433 --> 00:34:50,154
My name's Gwen.

752
00:34:50,934 --> 00:34:52,495
The game I'm showcasing this year is Kine.

753
00:34:52,616 --> 00:34:53,917
You can play it on the expo floor later.

754
00:34:54,765 --> 00:34:56,526
I hope you enjoy the nut butters and the rest of your day.

755
00:34:57,046 --> 00:34:57,226
Cheers.

756
00:34:57,266 --> 00:34:57,867
Here's to you.

757
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:58,027
Cheers.

758
00:34:58,047 --> 00:34:58,287
Thank you.

759
00:34:58,307 --> 00:34:58,827
Thank you.

760
00:34:58,887 --> 00:34:59,267
Thank you.

761
00:34:59,287 --> 00:34:59,868
Thank you.

762
00:34:59,908 --> 00:35:00,308
Thank you.

763
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:00,928
Thank you.

764
00:35:00,988 --> 00:35:01,728
Thank you.

765
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:02,269
Thank you.

766
00:35:02,329 --> 00:35:02,769
Thank you.

767
00:35:02,849 --> 00:35:03,509
Thank you.

768
00:35:03,529 --> 00:35:04,029
Thank you.

769
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:04,510
Thank you.

770
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:05,350
Thank you.

771
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:06,090
Thank you.

772
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:06,611
Thank you.

773
00:35:06,711 --> 00:35:07,391
Thank you.

774
00:35:09,392 --> 00:35:11,072
Hello, my name is Jon Paul Reinmuller.

775
00:35:11,093 --> 00:35:14,014
I have been in the industry for about 10 years.

776
00:35:14,114 --> 00:35:16,495
So I'm an animation specialist at Vicarious Visions,

777
00:35:17,755 --> 00:35:19,676
and I've been a lead on eight projects

778
00:35:19,696 --> 00:35:22,037
since I've been there, almost the whole time, actually,

779
00:35:22,057 --> 00:35:23,298
which is kind of hard to believe.

780
00:35:24,278 --> 00:35:24,478
But.

781
00:35:28,062 --> 00:35:30,885
It should advance and it won't.

782
00:35:32,726 --> 00:35:35,409
Before that, I had some experiences at Rhythm and Hues

783
00:35:35,469 --> 00:35:36,370
as an animation lead.

784
00:35:36,871 --> 00:35:38,913
And before that, I was in the military for eight years

785
00:35:39,213 --> 00:35:41,415
and had some opportunities to lead there as well.

786
00:35:41,756 --> 00:35:43,858
So why am I telling you this?

787
00:35:44,158 --> 00:35:45,199
Why does this even matter?

788
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:46,841
Why should you listen?

789
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:51,662
Well, what I'm saying here is that although I'm an animator,

790
00:35:51,722 --> 00:35:54,264
I've spent lots of my career as a manager as well.

791
00:35:54,744 --> 00:35:56,145
Some of you in here may have had

792
00:35:56,185 --> 00:35:57,406
completely different experiences,

793
00:35:57,626 --> 00:35:59,587
and I don't want to act like I know all of them.

794
00:36:00,508 --> 00:36:03,290
So this is from my perspective with some of my experiences.

795
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:07,072
So I've struggled ever since I became a lead

796
00:36:07,092 --> 00:36:10,114
to find a balance of creating animation content

797
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:12,895
while helping foster creative direction within my teams.

798
00:36:13,276 --> 00:36:14,416
So what's the problem with that?

799
00:36:15,517 --> 00:36:15,677
Well,

800
00:36:17,267 --> 00:36:22,430
Because animation is all I know and care about.

801
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,291
And this is what got me here.

802
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:25,632
So I need to be good at this.

803
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,413
I need to keep doing this.

804
00:36:27,493 --> 00:36:28,593
This is all I have, right?

805
00:36:29,594 --> 00:36:32,455
With that mindset, though, comes its own set of challenges.

806
00:36:36,603 --> 00:36:38,924
because I have always been focused as an animator

807
00:36:39,384 --> 00:36:40,424
with some leading involved.

808
00:36:40,524 --> 00:36:42,625
It's like I have two pieces of my brain

809
00:36:42,665 --> 00:36:44,406
kind of fighting over each other constantly

810
00:36:44,426 --> 00:36:46,806
in battle to save the hearts and minds of,

811
00:36:47,367 --> 00:36:49,047
I'm not really sure where I was going with that,

812
00:36:49,067 --> 00:36:51,028
but oh yeah, that's right, my animator brain,

813
00:36:51,048 --> 00:36:52,128
my animator brain, that's right.

814
00:36:52,528 --> 00:36:56,270
So I don't always have time to take on the shots that I want.

815
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:59,231
So I take on some shit shots some of the time

816
00:36:59,511 --> 00:37:00,812
so my team can stay passionate.

817
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:04,013
Games already operate on tight schedules.

818
00:37:04,113 --> 00:37:05,894
It's hard to take those animations to polish.

819
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:07,955
Now tack on the duties of being a lead.

820
00:37:08,215 --> 00:37:09,055
I just need to animate.

821
00:37:09,075 --> 00:37:09,676
Boy, I suck.

822
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:14,458
I still need to manage the team with its own responsibilities and the project with its

823
00:37:14,518 --> 00:37:19,682
own responsibilities, like tracking assets, career advancements, pipeline issues, outsourcing,

824
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:23,024
art directors, lots to think about and use energy towards.

825
00:37:23,084 --> 00:37:27,406
But you all know how much energy goes into a single performance or a complex body mechanics.

826
00:37:28,027 --> 00:37:33,050
There's so much new stuff to think about, all this added responsibility that was rewarding

827
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:37,172
in a sense, but also a bit tense since the same old question kept creeping in.

828
00:37:37,372 --> 00:37:38,233
I need to animate, right?

829
00:37:40,542 --> 00:37:43,667
To be a successful lead, I realized that I needed to reach out.

830
00:37:43,747 --> 00:37:48,834
I needed to find this new brand of creativity that would empower my role as a lead rather

831
00:37:48,874 --> 00:37:49,815
than distract from it.

832
00:37:50,336 --> 00:37:55,323
I started to think back on all the areas I had the privilege of being creative and having

833
00:37:55,463 --> 00:37:56,685
impact as a lead.

834
00:37:57,325 --> 00:38:01,567
working with narrative and art leadership to help shape who these characters were in our games

835
00:38:01,687 --> 00:38:06,369
through brainstorms, revisions, concepting, figuring out new ways to tell stories in games,

836
00:38:06,429 --> 00:38:10,590
maybe sometimes the same story. This allowed me to challenge my own knowledge of what I thought

837
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:16,532
storytelling was. I thought about how my direction was impacting animation quality. It wasn't just

838
00:38:16,572 --> 00:38:20,393
about holding myself accountable anymore. Understanding how different animators work

839
00:38:20,474 --> 00:38:24,675
and learning from them. I had to learn how to manage them differently to get the best team

840
00:38:24,695 --> 00:38:25,415
results in the end.

841
00:38:28,477 --> 00:38:32,060
Learning how to give the best feedback for that individual

842
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,042
helped me understand better and more precise ways

843
00:38:34,082 --> 00:38:34,822
to give feedback.

844
00:38:35,103 --> 00:38:37,905
And funny enough, it actually helped me understand

845
00:38:37,925 --> 00:38:41,048
the type of feedback that helped me too.

846
00:38:41,448 --> 00:38:42,689
I didn't stop becoming an animator

847
00:38:42,729 --> 00:38:43,790
just because I was a lead.

848
00:38:44,111 --> 00:38:45,672
I needed to rely on them just as much.

849
00:38:46,553 --> 00:38:50,577
Driving how to communicate a story through this process at an early stage and sell the idea

850
00:38:50,637 --> 00:38:54,281
honestly felt like this creative break. I would get more excited about this phase sometimes,

851
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:59,386
and it taught me a lot about myself as an artist and surprisingly something I was passionate

852
00:38:59,887 --> 00:39:01,088
about outside of animation.

853
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,841
I've stopped thinking about all the problems.

854
00:39:03,881 --> 00:39:06,463
I've stopped thinking just as an animator and now a lead,

855
00:39:06,723 --> 00:39:08,064
but more importantly as a game dev.

856
00:39:08,504 --> 00:39:11,466
I learned how to contribute to many areas of game development

857
00:39:11,506 --> 00:39:13,267
and not just animation, and I also learned

858
00:39:13,567 --> 00:39:15,909
how this can influence animation at my studio

859
00:39:16,049 --> 00:39:16,989
as we develop games.

860
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,331
I learned to grow leadership on the team.

861
00:39:19,571 --> 00:39:21,512
Training and mentoring new leads is important

862
00:39:21,552 --> 00:39:23,373
for the health of your department and your team.

863
00:39:23,753 --> 00:39:25,334
And some people want the opportunity,

864
00:39:25,354 --> 00:39:27,816
and being able to provide that support

865
00:39:27,856 --> 00:39:29,117
helps foster an environment

866
00:39:29,137 --> 00:39:30,938
where people can challenge themselves as well.

867
00:39:33,105 --> 00:39:35,546
And yes, growing leads and leaders on your team

868
00:39:35,586 --> 00:39:38,087
will allow me and you possibly

869
00:39:38,187 --> 00:39:39,788
to still be animating content.

870
00:39:40,188 --> 00:39:42,249
I have stayed strong against production

871
00:39:42,749 --> 00:39:45,070
and told them that I will never give up taking shots,

872
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:46,871
but I'll take on shots sometimes

873
00:39:46,911 --> 00:39:48,892
that aren't as intense on the workload,

874
00:39:49,272 --> 00:39:52,393
opening up space for my team to stay passionate and engaged,

875
00:39:52,513 --> 00:39:54,674
and the struggle continues to be very real.

876
00:39:55,535 --> 00:39:57,675
I am still working on the right balance

877
00:39:57,776 --> 00:40:00,017
because just like me, it has evolved.

878
00:40:04,836 --> 00:40:08,241
I know now that I will be creative and I will have a voice.

879
00:40:08,361 --> 00:40:11,486
It's just up to me to help define what that balance looks like.

880
00:40:12,347 --> 00:40:16,273
And now with all of that out of the way, I can get back to making really important decisions.

881
00:40:16,594 --> 00:40:20,399
Like on Fridays, it's donut and bagel day, so which one am I going to choose?

882
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,580
Finding your creative voice in what we do

883
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,861
comes with challenges and struggles, and that's okay.

884
00:40:26,921 --> 00:40:29,961
I don't know which way to go all the time,

885
00:40:30,181 --> 00:40:32,122
but as I look out at how I contribute

886
00:40:32,142 --> 00:40:33,862
to the creative process of being a game dev,

887
00:40:34,162 --> 00:40:36,063
it has become clear to me that leading,

888
00:40:36,463 --> 00:40:38,363
like animating, is what you make of it.

889
00:40:38,423 --> 00:40:41,044
The choice to find your voice in all of this

890
00:40:41,104 --> 00:40:42,924
is what has empowered me to be creative.

891
00:40:42,984 --> 00:40:43,805
Thank you for listening.

892
00:40:44,145 --> 00:40:45,045
I'm John Paul Ryan Miller,

893
00:40:45,085 --> 00:40:46,945
an animation specialist at Vicarious Visions.

894
00:40:46,985 --> 00:40:48,146
You can link up with me on Twitter.

895
00:40:48,466 --> 00:40:49,446
We're all week at GDC.

896
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:01,851
Let's hope this plays.

897
00:41:02,951 --> 00:41:03,972
So my name is Akita Teraduke.

898
00:41:04,593 --> 00:41:06,114
I've been animating for five years.

899
00:41:06,695 --> 00:41:08,576
Four of those years have been in mobile games.

900
00:41:09,317 --> 00:41:11,919
And more recently, my first year in PC console

901
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:13,921
in January of this year.

902
00:41:19,766 --> 00:41:22,929
And I currently live in, reside in Orange County, California.

903
00:41:23,169 --> 00:41:24,991
And I work at Nexon OC, so.

904
00:41:27,093 --> 00:41:29,235
Okay, this thing doesn't wanna play.

905
00:41:45,054 --> 00:41:46,194
Okay, I guess it's playing.

906
00:41:47,936 --> 00:41:50,698
So...

907
00:41:51,479 --> 00:41:52,800
What did I learn about my...

908
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,101
during my journey?

909
00:41:54,121 --> 00:41:57,183
I learned that I have a lot of problems.

910
00:41:57,643 --> 00:41:58,124
As you can tell.

911
00:41:59,945 --> 00:42:02,568
First of all, I wanted to grow, but I didn't really know where to begin.

912
00:42:02,748 --> 00:42:05,551
Am I considered a good animator now that I have a job in the industry?

913
00:42:05,751 --> 00:42:07,233
I really have no idea.

914
00:42:07,513 --> 00:42:12,558
But early on, I was struggling to make a connection with my job's subject matter.

915
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:14,661
Initially, everything was exciting.

916
00:42:14,841 --> 00:42:18,505
I was just happy to have a job and be doing animation.

917
00:42:19,586 --> 00:42:21,988
But over time, I got complacent and...

918
00:42:23,053 --> 00:42:24,194
I began to lose my motivation.

919
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:26,657
Plus, my traditional approach to animation,

920
00:42:26,917 --> 00:42:30,181
of diving right in without planning or researching at all,

921
00:42:30,902 --> 00:42:31,863
wasn't really working for me.

922
00:42:32,704 --> 00:42:35,327
So, I was really passionate, but it left me anxious,

923
00:42:35,387 --> 00:42:37,089
and I had to figure out a way to solve all these problems,

924
00:42:37,129 --> 00:42:39,011
but still make it an enjoyable experience for myself.

925
00:42:39,692 --> 00:42:40,593
So, let's talk about growth.

926
00:42:41,714 --> 00:42:42,815
It's hard to push yourself, right?

927
00:42:44,477 --> 00:42:49,341
Settling on your surface ideas may leave you bored and be reflected in your work, and you

928
00:42:49,361 --> 00:42:49,822
don't want that.

929
00:42:49,902 --> 00:42:50,943
So embrace being a nerd.

930
00:42:51,543 --> 00:42:56,428
Being a nerd lets you dive deeper into your research and help you find your voice as an

931
00:42:56,508 --> 00:42:56,788
artist.

932
00:42:57,209 --> 00:43:02,393
For me, being a freak encyclopedia of random facts and knowledge gave me the confidence

933
00:43:02,433 --> 00:43:04,355
behind my artistic decisions and opinions.

934
00:43:04,996 --> 00:43:06,757
There's a reason why they call them growing pains.

935
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:11,583
Finding your confidence can be a challenge for some, so maybe all you have to do is change

936
00:43:11,623 --> 00:43:12,283
your perspective.

937
00:43:12,364 --> 00:43:15,986
Speaking of perspective, I worked on Marvel's Avengers Academy, a mobile game.

938
00:43:17,207 --> 00:43:18,668
I am not into Marvel comic books.

939
00:43:18,868 --> 00:43:23,992
I know, please don't hate me, but I do have a healthy obsession with mythology and folklore.

940
00:43:24,132 --> 00:43:30,617
And by reframing Marvel as a modern day mythos, I was able to take a look at character progression

941
00:43:30,657 --> 00:43:34,920
like Thor, or characters like Thor, and take note of how his personality changed over time.

942
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:37,041
And just as an example, a Shakespearean actor that we...

943
00:43:37,937 --> 00:43:44,019
all known love inspired by classic mythology in the first film to the more goofy and awkward

944
00:43:44,059 --> 00:43:48,561
badass of the by the end of the third film. I want to talk about passion really quick.

945
00:43:49,201 --> 00:43:52,062
Have you ever seen a shot that you could feel the animator was having fun with it? Well,

946
00:43:52,102 --> 00:43:56,064
my friend Lindsay Lidecker animated this shot and she's incredibly funny and naturally animated.

947
00:43:57,064 --> 00:44:00,325
I think that she was very successful with this animation by establishing a personal

948
00:44:00,345 --> 00:44:05,067
connection with the character which led to other artists being inspired by her idea and

949
00:44:05,107 --> 00:44:05,588
creating art.

950
00:44:06,392 --> 00:44:06,812
on their own.

951
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:09,634
So if you can make a personal connection with your character,

952
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:11,776
you can make anything they do interesting, right?

953
00:44:11,936 --> 00:44:13,657
Be it running around with a cardboard box in your head,

954
00:44:14,037 --> 00:44:15,017
playing with a soccer ball,

955
00:44:15,498 --> 00:44:16,779
or simply sitting down in a chair.

956
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:19,400
However, it's not enough to just be passionate.

957
00:44:19,961 --> 00:44:22,202
I like to jump in and start doing things,

958
00:44:22,522 --> 00:44:25,104
but that would often lead to frustration,

959
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,224
and that was just simply because

960
00:44:26,264 --> 00:44:27,905
I just didn't have enough information.

961
00:44:29,346 --> 00:44:29,666
However...

962
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:37,313
I discovered that YouTube has plenty of information, including summaries that I could listen to

963
00:44:37,613 --> 00:44:39,735
without having to read the entire Marvel omnibus.

964
00:44:40,736 --> 00:44:46,261
I was on tight deadlines and I had a really tight schedule.

965
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,500
I had to make do with what I had.

966
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,702
In the case of Moon Girl and Devil Dino,

967
00:44:50,822 --> 00:44:52,583
I had no idea who either of these characters were.

968
00:44:53,203 --> 00:44:54,424
All they had to go off were visuals

969
00:44:54,964 --> 00:44:57,626
which often depict that Devil Dino's just a crazy dinosaur.

970
00:44:57,946 --> 00:44:59,047
But getting to know the relationship

971
00:44:59,087 --> 00:45:01,648
helped me focus on his playful puppy attitude instead.

972
00:45:01,708 --> 00:45:03,029
And Devil Dino had more to him

973
00:45:03,069 --> 00:45:05,030
than being just another angry dinosaur.

974
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:07,331
Even with all these strategies in full swing,

975
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,992
researching was still a pain.

976
00:45:09,893 --> 00:45:12,294
I love comedy and working on Family Guy's quests for stuff.

977
00:45:13,055 --> 00:45:15,417
But I learned I wasn't very good at comedy.

978
00:45:15,577 --> 00:45:17,979
With a suggestion of my peers, I went straight to the source

979
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,362
and watched as much Family Guy as my brain could handle.

980
00:45:21,482 --> 00:45:23,204
So like all of Family Guy.

981
00:45:24,124 --> 00:45:26,527
I began to get a better understanding of the show's

982
00:45:26,547 --> 00:45:29,729
style and really figured out where the characters were

983
00:45:29,749 --> 00:45:30,190
coming from.

984
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:33,493
This also caused me to have more of a snowball effect.

985
00:45:34,093 --> 00:45:35,595
And I ended up studying.

986
00:45:36,595 --> 00:45:39,336
comedic icons like Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin on my own.

987
00:45:39,577 --> 00:45:40,557
Turns out I was having fun.

988
00:45:41,097 --> 00:45:44,659
And I used the same approach when tasked with dance animations.

989
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:48,960
I'm naturally a horrible dancer, so I got tasked with all the dance animations.

990
00:45:49,461 --> 00:45:51,401
And it turns out that studying the complicated...

991
00:45:52,366 --> 00:45:57,188
mechanics of dance was actually an enjoyable experience for me. So let's recap this mess.

992
00:45:58,228 --> 00:46:02,089
Researching, first of all, helps you grow as an artist without noticing it. Fake it till you make

993
00:46:02,129 --> 00:46:06,410
it only gets you so far. And I couldn't just keep firing from the hip. I had to learn to be

994
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:11,192
invested with my research, which grew my confidence as an artist and animator. Finding the interest in

995
00:46:11,492 --> 00:46:16,234
assignments is going to be your responsibility. Shift your perspective until you can make that

996
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:17,834
connection. And...

997
00:46:18,557 --> 00:46:19,978
The more you know about what you're animating,

998
00:46:20,018 --> 00:46:21,780
the more informed your decisions will be in the end.

999
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:25,103
And finally, use creative ways to make research

1000
00:46:25,243 --> 00:46:26,264
and study fun for yourself.

1001
00:46:27,204 --> 00:46:29,486
If you're frustrated and it feels like a chore,

1002
00:46:29,566 --> 00:46:30,447
try a different approach.

1003
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:33,290
Instead of treating it as a formality,

1004
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:35,972
treat research as an opportunity to learn something new.

1005
00:46:37,093 --> 00:46:39,034
Researching ultimately is a friend and a powerful tool

1006
00:46:39,074 --> 00:46:40,496
in helping you find your artistic voice.

1007
00:46:41,176 --> 00:46:42,157
My name is Nikita Taranduke.

1008
00:46:42,177 --> 00:46:44,419
You can email me at nikitataranduke at dma.com.

1009
00:46:45,099 --> 00:46:46,621
Find me on Twitter at Nikita Taranduke.

1010
00:46:46,861 --> 00:46:47,521
Thank you very much.

1011
00:46:51,265 --> 00:46:51,586
I hope not.

1012
00:46:51,626 --> 00:46:58,290
All right.

1013
00:46:58,350 --> 00:46:59,291
My name is Nikki Roth.

1014
00:46:59,471 --> 00:47:01,493
I'm a tech animator at Google, and I'm

1015
00:47:01,533 --> 00:47:04,295
here to talk about confidence with confidence.

1016
00:47:05,896 --> 00:47:06,236
All right.

1017
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:09,718
So let me tell you a little bit about my first career

1018
00:47:09,738 --> 00:47:11,260
in gymnastics.

1019
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,861
I grew up as a competitive gymnast.

1020
00:47:14,422 --> 00:47:15,983
And as a gymnast, you are literally

1021
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:19,145
judged on your confidence and ability to execute skills.

1022
00:47:20,516 --> 00:47:24,478
There was this one skill, the full twisting side gainer.

1023
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:27,720
I remember spending an entire summer

1024
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,541
training this beam dismount.

1025
00:47:30,701 --> 00:47:34,843
I practiced it and practiced it until I felt confident

1026
00:47:35,043 --> 00:47:36,324
I could perform it under pressure.

1027
00:47:37,965 --> 00:47:39,666
You can imagine how nerve wracking it is

1028
00:47:39,706 --> 00:47:41,587
to throw yourself backwards and upside down

1029
00:47:41,647 --> 00:47:42,827
on a four inch piece of wood.

1030
00:47:44,248 --> 00:47:45,729
Beam was not my favorite event.

1031
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:48,210
It was more of a mind game.

1032
00:47:49,426 --> 00:47:51,447
but it was time to debut this skill.

1033
00:47:52,768 --> 00:47:55,809
So at the next meet, my coach gave me her pep talk.

1034
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:57,430
She told me I could do this.

1035
00:47:58,451 --> 00:48:00,532
She reminded me how many times I've done this before.

1036
00:48:01,793 --> 00:48:03,133
And she went over the 10 different things

1037
00:48:03,173 --> 00:48:05,295
I should focus on, but what really mattered

1038
00:48:06,115 --> 00:48:09,197
was that she and my teammates were there cheering me on.

1039
00:48:10,818 --> 00:48:13,379
I went through my own rituals, the internal monologue,

1040
00:48:13,459 --> 00:48:14,540
all right, Nikki, you got this.

1041
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,161
The drills that were now mantras,

1042
00:48:17,581 --> 00:48:19,042
lift, set, wrap.

1043
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:24,403
and all the ridiculous mind melding it took for me to believe I could do this.

1044
00:48:26,245 --> 00:48:29,289
As gymnasts, we are taught to stand and walk with attitude.

1045
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:36,657
So I strutted to the beam, I saluted, took a deep breath, and began the routine.

1046
00:48:37,958 --> 00:48:38,659
The moment came.

1047
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:39,740
Lift.

1048
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:40,261
Set.

1049
00:48:40,741 --> 00:48:40,961
Wrap.

1050
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:49,076
The connection, the form, call me biased, but it was solid.

1051
00:48:49,916 --> 00:48:51,657
And when we gymnasts stick a landing,

1052
00:48:52,337 --> 00:48:55,677
we salute not with one, but with both arms.

1053
00:48:57,418 --> 00:48:59,198
If you break down a gymnastics routine

1054
00:48:59,238 --> 00:49:02,458
into frames like an animation, it's all about posing.

1055
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:05,139
Strong lines, silhouettes.

1056
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:08,980
In a single pose, we can recognize confidence.

1057
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,200
In a single pose, we can read misery or mastery.

1058
00:49:14,246 --> 00:49:16,368
So if we frame this on my current career,

1059
00:49:16,408 --> 00:49:18,249
which is basically digital gymnastics,

1060
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:22,733
I am still being judged on my confidence to execute skill.

1061
00:49:23,573 --> 00:49:24,374
And it's not easy.

1062
00:49:25,315 --> 00:49:27,216
It takes practice, courage,

1063
00:49:27,817 --> 00:49:29,438
and it really helps to have support.

1064
00:49:31,159 --> 00:49:33,241
I want to help my team do great things,

1065
00:49:34,121 --> 00:49:35,723
but I need to show what I can offer.

1066
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:40,466
I need to own what I can do and own what I can't.

1067
00:49:41,928 --> 00:49:43,529
For me, I struggled with owning it.

1068
00:49:45,161 --> 00:49:47,181
It's hard to walk into a room with confidence

1069
00:49:47,421 --> 00:49:49,342
when you're not sure you have what it takes to be there.

1070
00:49:50,602 --> 00:49:51,982
Imposter syndrome is real.

1071
00:49:53,842 --> 00:49:56,623
Like gymnastics or anything else, it's more of a mind game.

1072
00:49:57,763 --> 00:49:59,583
You are there because you put in the time.

1073
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:01,984
You are there because you want to be.

1074
00:50:03,324 --> 00:50:03,984
So be there.

1075
00:50:04,944 --> 00:50:07,945
Sit at the table, literally sit at the table.

1076
00:50:08,765 --> 00:50:09,445
You belong there.

1077
00:50:10,885 --> 00:50:12,446
Be present and engaged.

1078
00:50:13,566 --> 00:50:14,366
Listen thoughtfully.

1079
00:50:15,547 --> 00:50:16,927
But don't just listen.

1080
00:50:18,688 --> 00:50:19,969
Form your own opinions.

1081
00:50:20,869 --> 00:50:23,931
Your perspective and your experience is so unique

1082
00:50:23,971 --> 00:50:26,912
that you and only you can bring it to the table.

1083
00:50:28,113 --> 00:50:29,334
But don't just bring it.

1084
00:50:31,375 --> 00:50:32,355
Share your thoughts.

1085
00:50:33,776 --> 00:50:36,137
Say them and say them with conviction.

1086
00:50:37,258 --> 00:50:39,719
Speak up, ask questions,

1087
00:50:40,939 --> 00:50:43,621
amplify your voice and be part of the conversation.

1088
00:50:45,027 --> 00:50:48,349
We can read body language, but we can't read minds.

1089
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:51,931
I used to be a chronic mumbler.

1090
00:50:52,732 --> 00:50:54,613
I was constantly having to repeat myself.

1091
00:50:55,413 --> 00:50:57,414
I would be interrupted or talked over.

1092
00:50:58,695 --> 00:51:00,636
But when you come from a place of passion,

1093
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:02,998
you will energize the room.

1094
00:51:04,539 --> 00:51:07,520
If you are authentic in what you have to say,

1095
00:51:09,041 --> 00:51:09,802
others will care.

1096
00:51:11,382 --> 00:51:13,884
If you are transparent and show empathy,

1097
00:51:15,243 --> 00:51:17,784
Others will appreciate what you choose to share.

1098
00:51:19,765 --> 00:51:22,066
On the other hand, speaking up does not

1099
00:51:22,126 --> 00:51:26,048
mean being the loudest or talking the most.

1100
00:51:27,308 --> 00:51:29,369
Speaking up is about sharing your voice

1101
00:51:29,809 --> 00:51:31,330
and sharing the floor.

1102
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:35,011
By including others around you, you

1103
00:51:35,051 --> 00:51:37,873
can create a dialogue and a space for everyone.

1104
00:51:39,587 --> 00:51:41,409
We all have different personality types.

1105
00:51:42,029 --> 00:51:43,610
We digest information differently,

1106
00:51:44,331 --> 00:51:45,592
express ourselves differently.

1107
00:51:45,612 --> 00:51:48,895
Not everyone prefers speaking in front of large crowds.

1108
00:51:49,775 --> 00:51:50,996
It makes us feel vulnerable.

1109
00:51:52,237 --> 00:51:53,538
When you are considerate of this,

1110
00:51:54,799 --> 00:51:57,821
when you empower others, it empowers you.

1111
00:51:59,062 --> 00:52:01,284
It builds a network of support and trust

1112
00:52:01,324 --> 00:52:03,726
that will absolutely help to build your confidence.

1113
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:06,849
And allies can give you the courage to speak up

1114
00:52:07,129 --> 00:52:08,130
when you need to the most.

1115
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:12,232
So, it's time to debut your skills.

1116
00:52:13,073 --> 00:52:16,456
Confidence comes with training, courage, and support.

1117
00:52:17,417 --> 00:52:18,979
I encourage you to practice sharing

1118
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:20,680
and share what you practice.

1119
00:52:21,621 --> 00:52:24,504
Trust it, own it, and when you nail it,

1120
00:52:24,884 --> 00:52:25,825
salute with both arms.

1121
00:52:27,567 --> 00:52:28,087
Thank you.

1122
00:52:28,108 --> 00:52:28,308
Thank you.

1123
00:52:42,463 --> 00:52:42,844
Hi.

1124
00:52:49,105 --> 00:52:49,346
Wait.

1125
00:52:49,986 --> 00:52:50,086
Oh.

1126
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:51,106
Oh boy.

1127
00:52:51,726 --> 00:52:52,266
Oh, there's water?

1128
00:52:52,486 --> 00:52:53,007
No, there's not.

1129
00:52:53,147 --> 00:52:53,687
Oh, damn.

1130
00:52:53,787 --> 00:52:54,727
Okay.

1131
00:52:55,267 --> 00:52:56,948
This is the last one of the day, right?

1132
00:52:56,988 --> 00:52:59,229
Last one of the day, last one of the day, this is it.

1133
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:00,009
Hi, everyone.

1134
00:53:00,189 --> 00:53:01,569
My name is Lana Byszynski.

1135
00:53:01,589 --> 00:53:04,630
I am a senior animator with Blizzard Entertainment.

1136
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:06,731
Hi, I'm Ryan Duffin.

1137
00:53:06,771 --> 00:53:09,011
I'm the animation director at Bioware in Austin.

1138
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:15,834
Were you the kid who drew in class when it was against the rules?

1139
00:53:16,575 --> 00:53:21,058
Were you a straight-A student, troublemaker, or a fool?

1140
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:30,945
Do you recall with joy or dread the promises admissions said?

1141
00:53:32,486 --> 00:53:36,569
So you spend all your money on an animation school.

1142
00:53:44,424 --> 00:53:50,611
You still think you'd argue that it should have been Henke

1143
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:56,356
But you sacrifice for your dreams to make things move on Xbox screens

1144
00:53:56,677 --> 00:54:00,640
What's the price you pay to get in the game industry?

1145
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:05,485
We scrub along life's timeline where others pitch we roll

1146
00:54:06,206 --> 00:54:07,427
When art school came

1147
00:54:11,387 --> 00:54:15,731
A normal life it has a path, for us it has a spline.

1148
00:54:16,151 --> 00:54:20,515
We chose to live our lives this way, one keyframe at a time.

1149
00:54:20,535 --> 00:54:20,635
Woo!

1150
00:54:21,096 --> 00:54:21,296
Woo!

1151
00:54:21,436 --> 00:54:21,596
Woo!

1152
00:54:21,756 --> 00:54:21,816
Woo!

1153
00:54:21,836 --> 00:54:21,956
Woo!

1154
00:54:22,357 --> 00:54:22,537
Woo!

1155
00:54:22,957 --> 00:54:23,157
Woo!

1156
00:54:23,598 --> 00:54:23,758
Woo!

1157
00:54:24,218 --> 00:54:24,378
Woo!

1158
00:54:24,859 --> 00:54:29,242
You graduate from college with a 50 grand degree.

1159
00:54:29,263 --> 00:54:33,106
But now you've got your first job with the decent.

1160
00:54:35,087 --> 00:54:39,754
The project begs for overtime, you're young and eager, this is fine.

1161
00:54:39,854 --> 00:54:44,020
When broken down by hour, you'd make more at Mickey D's.

1162
00:54:46,148 --> 00:54:50,671
You started on your second game without much introduction.

1163
00:54:50,691 --> 00:54:55,674
You carved your niche among an institutional dysfunction.

1164
00:54:55,694 --> 00:54:58,716
From step to block to polished blinds,

1165
00:54:58,756 --> 00:55:01,297
you've redone this whole shot 10 times

1166
00:55:01,618 --> 00:55:05,660
because your director's never heard of pre-production.

1167
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,522
You scrub along a life's timeline

1168
00:55:08,962 --> 00:55:10,623
where others pitch we rolled.

1169
00:55:11,524 --> 00:55:15,166
We eased out from a life of cycles, loops, and olds.

1170
00:55:16,621 --> 00:55:20,946
A normal life, it has a path, for us it has us blind.

1171
00:55:21,587 --> 00:55:25,692
We chose to live our lives this way, one keyframe at a time.

1172
00:55:27,262 --> 00:55:31,405
You get a corporate job and now you're making better pay

1173
00:55:31,925 --> 00:55:36,068
By annual reviews and a 401k

1174
00:55:36,869 --> 00:55:41,453
But now you fantasize about an indie legacy

1175
00:55:41,873 --> 00:55:46,196
Your game a work of art made with love and integrity

1176
00:55:46,236 --> 00:55:51,060
But maybe it gets lost in steam and you'll have to file for bankruptcy

1177
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:58,610
Corporate hours are no surprise at six months out you've worked all night. You'd think it'd be more organized

1178
00:56:03,972 --> 00:56:07,935
You've shipped a few titles, now you've done this for some years.

1179
00:56:08,536 --> 00:56:12,759
And there are options for you to grow, none of them are here.

1180
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:18,383
Do you compromise work and life to not displace your man or wife?

1181
00:56:18,664 --> 00:56:22,767
Or sacrifice stability to further your career?

1182
00:56:24,168 --> 00:56:29,252
You put your heart and soul in it, you're driven to succeed.

1183
00:56:30,213 --> 00:56:32,915
It's a decade down the line, you graduate.

1184
00:56:35,275 --> 00:56:39,818
You've got your spreadsheets so tight you forget what Maya looks like

1185
00:56:39,918 --> 00:56:44,241
and spend your days in twice as many meetings as you need.

1186
00:56:44,922 --> 00:56:49,265
We scrub along life's timeline where others pitch we roll.

1187
00:56:49,925 --> 00:56:54,208
We chase mastery of the NARD instead of chasing gold.

1188
00:56:54,228 --> 00:56:59,332
A normal life, it has a path, for us it has a spline.

1189
00:56:59,352 --> 00:57:04,115
We chose to live our lives this way one keyframe at a time.

1190
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,763
Now you're looking back over your successful career.

1191
00:57:13,864 --> 00:57:17,887
You've gotten some good and bad credits over the years.

1192
00:57:18,467 --> 00:57:20,789
But it's a fight to stay relevant.

1193
00:57:20,909 --> 00:57:23,331
Is there such thing as retirement?

1194
00:57:23,791 --> 00:57:28,575
In a couple decades, will there still be room for me here?

1195
00:57:28,595 --> 00:57:28,655
Woo!

1196
00:57:29,876 --> 00:57:32,438
We, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we,

1197
00:57:32,458 --> 00:57:33,439
we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we,

1198
00:57:33,459 --> 00:57:34,619
we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we,

1199
00:57:34,639 --> 00:57:36,201
we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we,

1200
00:57:36,221 --> 00:57:37,982
we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we.

1201
00:57:38,597 --> 00:57:40,437
where others pitch we rolled.

1202
00:57:41,678 --> 00:57:44,499
And you can feel the frame rate change

1203
00:57:44,739 --> 00:57:46,500
as we grow tired and old.

1204
00:57:47,801 --> 00:57:50,302
A normal life, it has a path.

1205
00:57:50,722 --> 00:57:52,763
For us, it has a spline.

1206
00:57:53,644 --> 00:57:58,546
We chose to live our lives this way, one keyframe at a time.

1207
00:57:59,647 --> 00:58:02,288
We scrub along life's timeline.

1208
00:58:02,768 --> 00:58:04,629
We keep our layers clean.

1209
00:58:05,903 --> 00:58:10,026
Because we can't undo or load up a fresh scene.

1210
00:58:12,067 --> 00:58:14,728
A normal life, it has a path.

1211
00:58:14,809 --> 00:58:17,210
For us, it has a spline.

1212
00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:23,053
We chose to live our lives this way, one key frame at a time.

1213
00:58:24,074 --> 00:58:28,997
We chose to live our lives this way, one key frame at a time.

1214
00:58:29,397 --> 00:58:32,979
We chose to live our lives this way.

1215
00:58:34,305 --> 00:58:38,393
One key frame at a time
