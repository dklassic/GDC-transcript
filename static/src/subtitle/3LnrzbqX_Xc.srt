1
00:00:06,852 --> 00:00:07,533
Good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:07,593 --> 00:00:08,355
Thanks for coming along.

3
00:00:08,895 --> 00:00:11,219
Well done for making it here for the first session of the day.

4
00:00:11,239 --> 00:00:13,001
I'm very impressed.

5
00:00:13,642 --> 00:00:16,026
My name's Phil, and I'm here to talk about improving

6
00:00:16,146 --> 00:00:19,631
player retention in your game by winning back lapsed players.

7
00:00:20,412 --> 00:00:22,214
Before we start, I've been asked to remind you to

8
00:00:22,514 --> 00:00:24,095
please put your devices on silent.

9
00:00:24,855 --> 00:00:26,436
Um, please remember to fill out the survey

10
00:00:26,476 --> 00:00:27,697
that will be sent around at the end.

11
00:00:28,238 --> 00:00:29,699
It's, uh, really good feedback for me,

12
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:31,400
as well as the conference organizers.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,862
And, um, remember the slides from the talk

14
00:00:33,882 --> 00:00:35,783
will be on the GDC Vault, and if you want them

15
00:00:36,023 --> 00:00:38,345
a bit quicker, you can email me, uh, as well.

16
00:00:38,725 --> 00:00:40,226
The details will be on there at the end as well.

17
00:00:43,188 --> 00:00:44,669
My talk today is going to try and answer

18
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,090
these questions.

19
00:00:47,096 --> 00:00:47,916
What is a returner?

20
00:00:48,316 --> 00:00:49,157
Why are they important?

21
00:00:49,597 --> 00:00:51,137
How can you get more of them back to your game

22
00:00:51,617 --> 00:00:53,658
and then increase your chances of keeping them?

23
00:00:54,818 --> 00:00:57,019
I've written this talk mainly for game designers

24
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:59,440
working on live games, but I hope it will be useful

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,501
for people in similar roles like producers

26
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:02,881
or product managers.

27
00:01:03,761 --> 00:01:05,842
Now, fair warning, there is a little bit of marketing

28
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:08,403
woven in there as well, and this is because I wanted

29
00:01:08,423 --> 00:01:10,043
to make sure I covered the full journey

30
00:01:10,283 --> 00:01:11,224
of a returning player.

31
00:01:12,064 --> 00:01:13,724
I also thought it could be useful for smaller

32
00:01:13,784 --> 00:01:15,325
or indie studios who have to do a bit

33
00:01:15,365 --> 00:01:16,485
of everything themselves.

34
00:01:18,112 --> 00:01:19,215
So a few words about myself.

35
00:01:19,956 --> 00:01:22,602
I'm the head of the RuneScape studio at Jagex.

36
00:01:22,662 --> 00:01:24,627
And we're an online games developer and publisher

37
00:01:24,907 --> 00:01:26,471
based in Cambridge in England.

38
00:01:27,575 --> 00:01:30,157
And I don't really get to do much hands-on design these days,

39
00:01:30,277 --> 00:01:32,700
but I've worked in design roles for about 17 years.

40
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,142
Started as a design assistant at Bullfrog,

41
00:01:35,502 --> 00:01:37,104
progressed to be a lead while at Sony,

42
00:01:37,584 --> 00:01:39,666
and then at Jagex I've become executive producer,

43
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,127
and then later studio head.

44
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:44,751
I've always loved playing online games, especially RPGs,

45
00:01:44,891 --> 00:01:46,933
so it's been really fantastic to be able to lead

46
00:01:46,953 --> 00:01:48,394
a large MMO like RuneScape.

47
00:01:49,215 --> 00:01:51,176
In doing this, I've needed to learn a lot

48
00:01:51,256 --> 00:01:54,137
about running online games and games as a service,

49
00:01:54,737 --> 00:01:56,118
and I hope I can share some of what I've learned

50
00:01:56,198 --> 00:01:57,399
with you guys here today.

51
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,741
I'm going to be using RuneScape as a case study

52
00:02:01,761 --> 00:02:04,682
throughout the talk, so I'll give a bit of a breakdown

53
00:02:05,122 --> 00:02:05,963
of what it's all about.

54
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,405
RuneScape is a traditional fantasy MMORPG.

55
00:02:10,745 --> 00:02:12,586
It's quite different from other games in the genre

56
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,387
because it mixes a sandboxy open world

57
00:02:15,607 --> 00:02:17,408
with a lot of storytelling and quests.

58
00:02:18,609 --> 00:02:19,270
Oops, there we go.

59
00:02:20,772 --> 00:02:22,555
The original version was launched all the way back

60
00:02:22,695 --> 00:02:27,302
in 2001, and we've updated it pretty much weekly ever since.

61
00:02:27,703 --> 00:02:30,166
That's to add new content, improve the graphics,

62
00:02:30,307 --> 00:02:32,089
and even update the technology behind the game.

63
00:02:33,131 --> 00:02:35,113
It was one of the first free-to-play games around,

64
00:02:35,393 --> 00:02:37,475
and the business model has always been evolving.

65
00:02:38,596 --> 00:02:39,877
It's a bit of a hybrid now.

66
00:02:40,337 --> 00:02:41,698
The basic game is free.

67
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:44,601
There's an optional subscription if you want access

68
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:47,603
to tons more content, and there's optional

69
00:02:47,623 --> 00:02:50,706
microtransactions for cosmetic items and boosts.

70
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,942
We've got 160 development and publishing staff

71
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:55,762
working on the game.

72
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,404
But in addition to the main RuneScape game,

73
00:02:58,504 --> 00:02:59,966
we have other products in the franchise.

74
00:03:00,466 --> 00:03:02,928
There's a retro server that we call Old School RuneScape.

75
00:03:03,448 --> 00:03:07,131
We have a mobile companion app, currently developing a CCG

76
00:03:07,911 --> 00:03:10,113
called Chronicle RuneScape Legends.

77
00:03:10,693 --> 00:03:13,355
And we're also starting to work on a new RuneScape MMO.

78
00:03:14,616 --> 00:03:16,098
So if we quickly cover our players.

79
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:19,469
Most of them are male, aged between 16 and 26.

80
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:22,792
And although we have a number of localized versions

81
00:03:22,852 --> 00:03:24,293
of the game around the world, it's

82
00:03:24,313 --> 00:03:26,014
the English one that's the most popular.

83
00:03:27,535 --> 00:03:29,857
Retention is our speciality, because over half

84
00:03:29,897 --> 00:03:31,638
of our current active players have

85
00:03:31,658 --> 00:03:33,059
been playing for over six years.

86
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,361
And they're really dedicated as well,

87
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:38,183
with an average session length of over 90 minutes,

88
00:03:38,563 --> 00:03:40,865
and about half of our players play every day.

89
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:44,586
We're also really blessed to have a very active fan

90
00:03:44,626 --> 00:03:47,148
community, especially in video and live streaming.

91
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:49,949
And the game is regularly in the top 10 on Twitch.

92
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:54,772
I'm always fascinated by stats from other people's games.

93
00:03:54,973 --> 00:03:56,233
So I thought I'd return the favor

94
00:03:56,674 --> 00:03:59,395
and share some of our commercial metrics.

95
00:04:00,736 --> 00:04:02,958
In terms of lifetime revenues, we're now very close

96
00:04:02,978 --> 00:04:05,379
to ticking over the 3 quarters of a billion dollar mark.

97
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,541
Our daily active user count is between 500,000 and 600,000,

98
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,982
so depending on the day of the week.

99
00:04:11,822 --> 00:04:14,024
Our monthly active users is just over 2 million.

100
00:04:15,705 --> 00:04:17,927
We have over 600,000 subscribers.

101
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:20,649
It's 619,000 as of this morning.

102
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,792
And that's been gradually growing for the last couple

103
00:04:23,812 --> 00:04:24,152
of years.

104
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:28,115
Our average concurrent users is around 60,000.

105
00:04:28,716 --> 00:04:32,739
And that peaks to 90,000 in the evenings or at the weekends.

106
00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:34,340
And when we run special events, it

107
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,342
can go up to about 120,000, 130,000 players online at once.

108
00:04:39,717 --> 00:04:41,598
I hope these are pretty healthy stats,

109
00:04:41,638 --> 00:04:43,540
and I think it shows that along with games like

110
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,382
World of Warcraft, who've also been growing

111
00:04:45,402 --> 00:04:46,803
their subscriptions in recent years,

112
00:04:47,243 --> 00:04:49,565
that MMOs can have really, really long tails,

113
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:51,627
almost becoming evergreen games.

114
00:04:52,268 --> 00:04:53,729
But to achieve that, a game's retention

115
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:54,910
has got to be really good.

116
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,572
And not just focusing on keeping players,

117
00:04:57,792 --> 00:05:00,555
but finding ways to get lapsed players to return.

118
00:05:02,797 --> 00:05:04,118
So what is a returner?

119
00:05:05,027 --> 00:05:05,949
This is my definition.

120
00:05:06,249 --> 00:05:07,932
It's someone who comes back to your game

121
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:10,515
after a sustained lapse from regular play.

122
00:05:10,535 --> 00:05:13,059
And I say regular play because I'm not including

123
00:05:13,099 --> 00:05:14,521
those who've only briefly tried the game

124
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:15,363
and bounced straight off.

125
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:16,264
I think, as you'll see,

126
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:18,427
they're not gonna be relevant for your attention.

127
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,602
For RuneScape, we determine if a player has lapsed

128
00:05:22,942 --> 00:05:24,403
based on a duration of three months,

129
00:05:24,963 --> 00:05:26,485
and we base that off whether they've been out

130
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:27,746
of the membership subscription.

131
00:05:28,186 --> 00:05:29,887
Now, this is different from what most games will do.

132
00:05:29,907 --> 00:05:31,228
It's because our game's a bit different.

133
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,950
It's quite a long-form experience,

134
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,731
and the subscription, for us,

135
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:36,552
ultimately, is the most important thing,

136
00:05:36,612 --> 00:05:37,893
and that's why, in this case,

137
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:39,795
we use it as the measure of engagement.

138
00:05:40,595 --> 00:05:42,757
The more standard approach that makes sense for most people

139
00:05:42,897 --> 00:05:45,559
is a lapse duration of over a month,

140
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,602
and that's based on the player being inactive during that time.

141
00:05:49,622 --> 00:05:51,183
And that's what I'd recommend for most people.

142
00:05:53,945 --> 00:05:56,567
So why should you even bother trying to attract returners?

143
00:05:57,228 --> 00:05:58,649
Well, compared to a new player,

144
00:05:58,749 --> 00:06:00,970
a returner is going to be easier to acquire.

145
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:03,172
That's because they feel a lot less of the friction

146
00:06:03,432 --> 00:06:04,773
that a new player will experience

147
00:06:04,913 --> 00:06:06,955
when they come into a game for the first time.

148
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,904
Former players will know roughly what's on offer,

149
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,726
so their expectations are going to match.

150
00:06:13,527 --> 00:06:15,610
They will understand the fundamentals of the game

151
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,452
already, should have already invested

152
00:06:17,472 --> 00:06:19,014
a good amount of time in it, hopefully

153
00:06:19,054 --> 00:06:19,875
remember enjoying it.

154
00:06:20,476 --> 00:06:23,780
And they may already be past that all-important first

155
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,021
payment barrier as well.

156
00:06:25,862 --> 00:06:28,624
This should all mean that the cost to reacquire a lapsed player

157
00:06:29,124 --> 00:06:30,905
should be lower than that of a brand new player.

158
00:06:31,366 --> 00:06:34,168
When we averaged all of RuneScape's user acquisition spend last year,

159
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,930
the cost per paying user for lapsed players was $3,

160
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,011
and for new players it was $3.80,

161
00:06:40,472 --> 00:06:42,714
which for us makes the re-acquisition route

162
00:06:42,994 --> 00:06:47,217
around 25% less expensive for a similar lifetime value.

163
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,142
Returners are going to become more relevant to you over time.

164
00:06:53,522 --> 00:06:54,883
As the game gets older,

165
00:06:55,463 --> 00:06:57,324
getting new players in is going to become tougher,

166
00:06:57,504 --> 00:06:59,125
but the number of lapsed players you'll have,

167
00:06:59,305 --> 00:07:00,586
of course, is going to be increasing.

168
00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:03,688
So there'll be a shift in their relative importance.

169
00:07:04,128 --> 00:07:05,809
And in this chart,

170
00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:08,230
you can see how this has happened for RuneScape,

171
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,172
with the proportion of incoming returning members,

172
00:07:11,332 --> 00:07:12,473
which is shown in red,

173
00:07:13,413 --> 00:07:16,055
increasing from half to two-thirds over four years.

174
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:17,796
So it's gradual, but it's significant.

175
00:07:19,429 --> 00:07:21,771
It's true that the longer a player has been away,

176
00:07:22,252 --> 00:07:23,793
the harder it will be to win them back,

177
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:26,736
but I still say that long-term lapses

178
00:07:26,816 --> 00:07:28,277
are still really viable for you.

179
00:07:29,318 --> 00:07:30,119
And here's a bit of proof.

180
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,161
This chart shows RuneScape's incoming members

181
00:07:33,622 --> 00:07:36,404
for all of last year, broken down by the amount of time

182
00:07:36,564 --> 00:07:37,225
they've been away.

183
00:07:37,805 --> 00:07:39,867
The largest group you can see right at the bottom,

184
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:43,110
they've been away for over a year.

185
00:07:44,401 --> 00:07:47,464
Now our game is a bit of an extreme case because it's been around for a very long time,

186
00:07:48,104 --> 00:07:52,188
but you should still get the sense of the potential you can have from long-term lapsed players.

187
00:07:52,768 --> 00:07:56,591
We still get people returning to the game with absences of over 10 years.

188
00:08:00,027 --> 00:08:02,048
RuneScape owes a lot to returning players.

189
00:08:02,328 --> 00:08:04,309
The majority of our current active players

190
00:08:04,429 --> 00:08:07,010
have at some point lapsed for at least three months.

191
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:10,111
So two thirds, almost two thirds of our players

192
00:08:10,312 --> 00:08:11,972
are already counted as returners.

193
00:08:12,773 --> 00:08:14,453
So you can see how important they can be

194
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:16,294
deep into a game's life cycle.

195
00:08:17,904 --> 00:08:20,886
I believe that returners are the key to a game's longevity.

196
00:08:21,407 --> 00:08:23,568
Because if you're not going to be able to retain absolutely

197
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,391
everyone, and the rate of new players you can get

198
00:08:26,991 --> 00:08:29,633
is going to slowly decrease, your long-term prospects

199
00:08:29,653 --> 00:08:32,415
will be dependent on your ability to attract returners.

200
00:08:34,677 --> 00:08:36,338
So hopefully you'd agree that there

201
00:08:36,398 --> 00:08:38,700
is value in putting attention into returning players,

202
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,441
but how are you going to go about doing that?

203
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:42,923
I'll step through the major challenges,

204
00:08:43,363 --> 00:08:45,045
and you'll see that they represent the returning

205
00:08:45,065 --> 00:08:46,746
player's journey back into the game.

206
00:08:50,204 --> 00:08:50,404
Come on.

207
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,527
First, you need to find a way to communicate

208
00:08:54,628 --> 00:08:56,529
to lapsed players because they're not going

209
00:08:56,549 --> 00:08:58,631
to be proactively checking in on your game.

210
00:08:59,692 --> 00:09:01,893
Having reached them, you need to grab their interest

211
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:03,314
and motivate them to return.

212
00:09:03,915 --> 00:09:05,516
This is tough because you've got to overcome

213
00:09:05,536 --> 00:09:08,198
whatever reluctance made them lapse in the first place.

214
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:11,043
And if you can get them to come back,

215
00:09:11,143 --> 00:09:13,784
you have to help them get reacquainted with your game.

216
00:09:14,124 --> 00:09:16,745
This is, well, sorry, they may have been away

217
00:09:16,825 --> 00:09:18,786
for only a month and just need a refresher.

218
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:20,486
They may have been away for years

219
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:21,987
and need a lot more assistance.

220
00:09:22,207 --> 00:09:24,268
And that variability is an extra challenge.

221
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:27,149
But hopefully you can get them back

222
00:09:27,189 --> 00:09:28,229
and into the swing of things.

223
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,170
And now you need to engage their interest

224
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,471
for the longer term so you can, you know,

225
00:09:32,611 --> 00:09:35,312
prevent them from easily churning straight away again.

226
00:09:37,075 --> 00:09:39,437
And then looking further ahead, the challenge is to develop

227
00:09:39,637 --> 00:09:41,598
a design mindset as you make the game,

228
00:09:41,978 --> 00:09:45,120
which embraces returners and considers their specific needs

229
00:09:45,481 --> 00:09:47,882
so you can build on these benefits well into the future.

230
00:09:49,883 --> 00:09:52,005
These points are going to be the chapters I'll cover

231
00:09:52,045 --> 00:09:54,126
through the rest of the talk, and I'll dive into each

232
00:09:54,246 --> 00:09:55,927
in a bit more detail in turn.

233
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,258
That starts with communication.

234
00:09:59,838 --> 00:10:02,641
And the first challenge is finding ways to reach out

235
00:10:02,741 --> 00:10:04,303
and get a message to LAPS players.

236
00:10:04,844 --> 00:10:06,726
This will be difficult because they won't be loading your app

237
00:10:06,886 --> 00:10:07,827
or visiting your website.

238
00:10:09,097 --> 00:10:10,697
Email is probably the most obvious channel

239
00:10:10,838 --> 00:10:13,739
for win-back messages, but it does have its limitations.

240
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,981
This is because engagement rates tend to be low.

241
00:10:17,901 --> 00:10:20,202
Getting marketing emails from games you don't play anymore

242
00:10:20,262 --> 00:10:21,303
can be annoying.

243
00:10:21,523 --> 00:10:23,404
So there's a friction problem there as well.

244
00:10:23,964 --> 00:10:26,145
And there's a whole bunch of technical risks

245
00:10:26,185 --> 00:10:28,887
to deal with, especially if you want to use email at volume.

246
00:10:30,928 --> 00:10:33,349
So we found using email to contact lapsed players

247
00:10:33,469 --> 00:10:34,890
has only modest success rates.

248
00:10:35,854 --> 00:10:37,595
You can see here that on RuneScape,

249
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:40,278
our win-back emails have around a 16% open rate

250
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,139
and under 2% click-through rate.

251
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,921
But that's actually not too different from the success

252
00:10:44,981 --> 00:10:48,244
rates we see in marketing emails for other games

253
00:10:48,384 --> 00:10:49,805
or when sending to active players.

254
00:10:50,185 --> 00:10:51,746
It's just the way it works.

255
00:10:54,461 --> 00:10:56,923
But if email isn't enough, what are your other options?

256
00:10:57,803 --> 00:11:00,085
I recommend embracing social media

257
00:11:00,145 --> 00:11:02,166
and this concept of passive communication.

258
00:11:03,087 --> 00:11:05,248
By this, I mean you're not actively pushing messages

259
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:07,089
directly at people.

260
00:11:07,289 --> 00:11:08,530
You're putting them out there, but you're not

261
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,911
forcing them down people's throats.

262
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:12,153
You're allowing people to stay in touch with you,

263
00:11:12,393 --> 00:11:13,413
but on their own terms.

264
00:11:15,195 --> 00:11:16,635
To specifically target returners,

265
00:11:17,096 --> 00:11:19,597
I recommend building a particular social media channel

266
00:11:19,938 --> 00:11:20,758
around their needs.

267
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:25,254
Here you're going to want less quantity, but higher interest,

268
00:11:25,374 --> 00:11:28,337
higher quality, less of that day-to-day community chatter,

269
00:11:29,137 --> 00:11:32,200
community trivia, and a focus on the really big and important

270
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,421
game updates or events.

271
00:11:34,662 --> 00:11:37,144
We found that Facebook and YouTube work particularly well

272
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:39,807
for this because people don't expect you to be filling them

273
00:11:39,847 --> 00:11:41,128
with lots of different stuff every day.

274
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:44,811
Twitter, on the other hand, much more fast moving, more

275
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:48,394
conversational, I don't think would work as well from this

276
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:48,915
perspective.

277
00:11:51,488 --> 00:11:54,970
Here you can see a comparison of traffic to our game from different sources.

278
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,571
These are visitors who aren't active players.

279
00:11:58,111 --> 00:12:00,973
You can see how the visitors generated by our marketing emails,

280
00:12:01,093 --> 00:12:02,653
which is second to the right,

281
00:12:03,674 --> 00:12:05,815
are dwarfed by most of the social media channels.

282
00:12:05,835 --> 00:12:09,217
And you can see how Reddit really brings us a lot of traffic.

283
00:12:09,557 --> 00:12:12,438
So I'll take a slight diversion and talk about Reddit quickly.

284
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:16,886
These are some screen grabs I took on a day last month.

285
00:12:17,908 --> 00:12:19,751
Now, sorry, from the RuneScape subreddit.

286
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:20,954
This isn't something we run.

287
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:23,298
It's administrated by player volunteers,

288
00:12:23,539 --> 00:12:25,222
but we do try and actively support it.

289
00:12:26,074 --> 00:12:28,796
As you can see, Reddit seems to attract a lot of players

290
00:12:28,856 --> 00:12:30,717
who are just generally curious about games

291
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:32,298
and interested in returning,

292
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:34,580
and kind of want more information or reason to do so.

293
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:37,382
In our subreddit, that came to the point

294
00:12:37,422 --> 00:12:40,965
where the admins had to add specific materials

295
00:12:41,085 --> 00:12:44,007
for returning players to the subreddit sidebar,

296
00:12:44,027 --> 00:12:45,748
because they were getting so much interest

297
00:12:45,788 --> 00:12:46,849
and questions on this front.

298
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:50,171
So if you're not already working with Reddit,

299
00:12:50,271 --> 00:12:50,991
definitely do so.

300
00:12:53,338 --> 00:12:57,339
I think that as developers we can really benefit from fronting our own games on social media.

301
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:02,461
We found that having lots of staff out there talking to players, it gets more followers,

302
00:13:02,801 --> 00:13:05,122
it generates more buzz and it helps build trust.

303
00:13:05,622 --> 00:13:08,963
And it shows that you're real people, you're not just a brand, and it invites players to

304
00:13:09,003 --> 00:13:09,443
talk with you.

305
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:13,385
So it's a great venue to talk about what you're doing and to get feedback.

306
00:13:15,947 --> 00:13:17,729
And then this helps you stay in touch with players

307
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:18,910
when they lapse from your game.

308
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,912
Having lots of devs available means

309
00:13:21,312 --> 00:13:23,674
there's collectively more followers for your game,

310
00:13:23,694 --> 00:13:27,158
and lapsing players may stay following

311
00:13:27,258 --> 00:13:30,040
an individual developer they have a personal interest in.

312
00:13:33,261 --> 00:13:36,202
Players are a fantastic asset when it comes to reaching out

313
00:13:36,262 --> 00:13:37,122
to those who've lapsed.

314
00:13:37,882 --> 00:13:40,723
If you can build features that help players share content

315
00:13:40,763 --> 00:13:43,864
from your game, you're going to cultivate more player advocates

316
00:13:44,104 --> 00:13:45,344
and more content creators.

317
00:13:45,884 --> 00:13:47,805
And that will give your game a bigger reach out

318
00:13:47,885 --> 00:13:51,425
to the wider space of gamers.

319
00:13:51,545 --> 00:13:55,166
And this means lapsed players are

320
00:13:55,186 --> 00:13:57,567
more likely to encounter media shared from your game.

321
00:13:57,967 --> 00:13:59,848
So there's more chances for it to.

322
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:04,469
trigger people's interest in your game and in returning.

323
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,150
Now, the obvious stuff to do is to create a function

324
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,571
in your game that posts the player's latest achievement

325
00:14:10,591 --> 00:14:11,532
to Twitter or Facebook.

326
00:14:11,992 --> 00:14:13,052
And those things do work.

327
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:15,153
But to be most effective, you should

328
00:14:15,173 --> 00:14:17,394
be looking to provide players with a tool set

329
00:14:17,494 --> 00:14:19,775
to create their own personal content, something that's

330
00:14:19,855 --> 00:14:22,276
unique to them and something they can feel really proud of.

331
00:14:23,236 --> 00:14:25,077
We built a few features that have worked well for this.

332
00:14:25,117 --> 00:14:26,697
So I'll give you some examples.

333
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:30,178
The first is called the Orb of Oculus.

334
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:32,540
It's nothing to do with Oculus Rift just yet, unfortunately.

335
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,323
It's a feature that puts the game camera

336
00:14:36,403 --> 00:14:38,584
into an object that players can control.

337
00:14:38,924 --> 00:14:40,686
It essentially decouples the game camera

338
00:14:40,966 --> 00:14:41,987
from their player character,

339
00:14:42,287 --> 00:14:43,808
allows it to be moved independently.

340
00:14:44,288 --> 00:14:46,910
You can hide the game UI, position everything in a scene.

341
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,052
So players can set up post screenshots

342
00:14:49,532 --> 00:14:52,114
for stuff they want to share

343
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:55,536
or allows them to record video clips for their machinima.

344
00:14:56,257 --> 00:15:00,155
You can see some examples of some nice posed shots players have created on the screen.

345
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:04,532
The next example is from our Bestry.

346
00:15:04,692 --> 00:15:07,574
This is a feature on our website where players can look up

347
00:15:07,634 --> 00:15:09,856
the stats of monsters, pose them,

348
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,317
look at their animations.

349
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:13,879
And for almost no extra effort, we

350
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,380
put in this green screen mode, which

351
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,342
allows players to much more easily cut out the characters

352
00:15:18,802 --> 00:15:20,723
and bring them out of the background

353
00:15:20,763 --> 00:15:23,645
so they can use them in their own memes on social media

354
00:15:23,785 --> 00:15:24,706
or their fan art.

355
00:15:25,146 --> 00:15:26,867
So something, a tiny, tiny thing that

356
00:15:26,887 --> 00:15:28,088
was really useful for players.

357
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:32,061
My last example was a bit more involved,

358
00:15:32,281 --> 00:15:34,423
and this was a full integration we did with Twitch.

359
00:15:34,443 --> 00:15:37,666
And it allowed players to stream and broadcast straight

360
00:15:37,706 --> 00:15:40,469
from the game without needing to install any other software

361
00:15:40,609 --> 00:15:42,971
or get confused with all the configuration.

362
00:15:43,552 --> 00:15:45,233
And it acted as a stepping stone that

363
00:15:45,273 --> 00:15:47,656
encouraged players to try out live streaming

364
00:15:47,776 --> 00:15:48,496
for minimal effort.

365
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:54,794
You can support your content creators in broader ways as well.

366
00:15:55,614 --> 00:15:59,037
We find that a lot of lapsed players still regularly watch the YouTube videos

367
00:15:59,257 --> 00:16:02,180
or the broadcasts of their favorite famous players.

368
00:16:03,001 --> 00:16:05,543
If you give your players the tools, the support, and the confidence

369
00:16:06,063 --> 00:16:07,304
to share content from your game,

370
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:09,846
they'll help you in reaching out to those who've lapsed.

371
00:16:10,727 --> 00:16:12,609
You can offer a bunch of things to help them with this.

372
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:14,820
A big one is exposure.

373
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,583
As a developer, you can push a lot of traffic their way.

374
00:16:17,983 --> 00:16:19,865
And this isn't just a community management job either.

375
00:16:19,925 --> 00:16:21,266
You can design it into the game.

376
00:16:21,986 --> 00:16:23,548
In the Twitch integration I just showed,

377
00:16:23,868 --> 00:16:25,329
there's a directory of current streamers

378
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,511
for players to click and go and watch.

379
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,562
By giving your content creators previews of game features before they're released,

380
00:16:34,022 --> 00:16:35,603
they can have something special to show off.

381
00:16:36,183 --> 00:16:39,625
We occasionally do private testing of new game features before full release,

382
00:16:40,145 --> 00:16:42,446
and we invite video makers to take part in these tests.

383
00:16:42,966 --> 00:16:44,487
For us, it generates a bit more awareness,

384
00:16:44,987 --> 00:16:47,788
and for them, it gets exclusive content to put in their videos

385
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:50,070
for them to drive interest themselves.

386
00:16:51,165 --> 00:16:54,007
If you're feeling really brave, you can give certain players

387
00:16:54,748 --> 00:16:55,809
some of your admin tools.

388
00:16:56,269 --> 00:16:58,111
So obviously, limited versions of what

389
00:16:58,131 --> 00:17:00,974
you might give your community management or game masters.

390
00:17:01,874 --> 00:17:02,935
Made safe, obviously.

391
00:17:03,996 --> 00:17:06,138
So for example, we've given some of our live streamers

392
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,021
a function where they can spawn a very limited number

393
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:12,304
of rare items to give away in competitions on their stream.

394
00:17:12,584 --> 00:17:13,685
And that goes down really well.

395
00:17:13,725 --> 00:17:14,506
They're really popular.

396
00:17:14,526 --> 00:17:16,107
And it's a mutually beneficial thing.

397
00:17:18,157 --> 00:17:20,518
Overall, though, the best thing your content creators want

398
00:17:20,698 --> 00:17:23,739
is gameplay that's as fun to watch as it is to play.

399
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:25,999
Obviously, this is a massive subject

400
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:27,259
and worthy of a whole separate talk,

401
00:17:27,639 --> 00:17:29,600
and there are a few on the GDC this week.

402
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,561
So if you're interested, definitely look into that stuff,

403
00:17:32,901 --> 00:17:34,641
because the more viewers your content creators

404
00:17:34,741 --> 00:17:35,561
and broadcasters have,

405
00:17:35,961 --> 00:17:37,902
the more people can keep in touch with your game,

406
00:17:38,422 --> 00:17:40,502
even when they're not actively playing themselves.

407
00:17:42,863 --> 00:17:44,343
Okay, so on to the next chapter.

408
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:47,777
Now we've got ways to reach out to lapsed players,

409
00:17:48,237 --> 00:17:50,018
what are we going to do to draw them back

410
00:17:50,358 --> 00:17:51,878
and when's the best time to do it?

411
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:54,299
I've really come to believe that it's possible

412
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:56,520
to design game features that specifically

413
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,740
talk to lapsed players.

414
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,221
The challenge is to find features

415
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:01,581
that are going to pique their interest.

416
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:04,162
And a great way to do this is to focus

417
00:18:04,202 --> 00:18:05,922
on iconic and well-known content.

418
00:18:06,362 --> 00:18:08,523
So even if a lapsed player has been away for a while,

419
00:18:08,923 --> 00:18:11,124
it's something they'll still remember and a concept

420
00:18:11,144 --> 00:18:12,324
they'll still get excited about.

421
00:18:13,298 --> 00:18:16,201
I recommend using characters, locations, or game features

422
00:18:16,821 --> 00:18:18,743
that players have strong attachments to

423
00:18:19,023 --> 00:18:20,364
and are likely to still care about.

424
00:18:22,345 --> 00:18:24,827
Another approach is to address their reasons for leaving.

425
00:18:25,508 --> 00:18:28,029
You can obviously solve problems like boredom and frustration

426
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,171
by adding new features and content.

427
00:18:30,852 --> 00:18:33,493
And if some players have left because of a problem

428
00:18:33,534 --> 00:18:34,814
in your game, you can, of course,

429
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,696
fix the thing that's caused them to leave.

430
00:18:38,257 --> 00:18:40,598
we found it really helpful to get inspiration

431
00:18:40,638 --> 00:18:43,279
for such features by using analytics and surveys.

432
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:45,380
You can look at historical data

433
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,941
and try and find clusters of leavers

434
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,342
who have similar characteristics.

435
00:18:48,902 --> 00:18:50,263
Maybe there's a certain level banding

436
00:18:50,303 --> 00:18:52,664
where a disproportionate amount of players have left,

437
00:18:53,044 --> 00:18:54,785
and you can dive in, see what's going on,

438
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:55,825
and try and address that.

439
00:18:57,006 --> 00:18:59,207
Surveys to lapsed players are also really useful

440
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:01,608
to get a clearer understanding of why they've left

441
00:19:02,069 --> 00:19:04,250
and what you could do to motivate them to return.

442
00:19:06,569 --> 00:19:08,510
I'll give you some examples from RuneScape

443
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,732
that have worked successfully over the last few years.

444
00:19:11,732 --> 00:19:15,635
The first approach is content that resolves a big cliffhanger.

445
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,237
So you should go back to something in your game

446
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,999
where players will be curious to see what happens next.

447
00:19:22,641 --> 00:19:24,002
We did this in RuneScape last year

448
00:19:25,143 --> 00:19:27,024
by finishing a ten-year-long quest series,

449
00:19:27,324 --> 00:19:29,606
which ended in the opening of a massive lost city.

450
00:19:30,186 --> 00:19:32,968
And this was a city that players had seen the outside walls

451
00:19:33,028 --> 00:19:34,990
and seen the gates, but never been able to get in.

452
00:19:36,087 --> 00:19:38,350
The update was built around this iconic content

453
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:40,612
most players would have played at some point in the past,

454
00:19:41,093 --> 00:19:43,556
and in addition to its narrative significance,

455
00:19:43,696 --> 00:19:45,037
it also added a lot of content.

456
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,580
So when people did come back, they had lots of stuff to do.

457
00:19:50,864 --> 00:19:52,966
Another approach is to fix a problem in the game

458
00:19:53,046 --> 00:19:54,668
that you think has caused players to leave.

459
00:19:55,804 --> 00:19:57,545
A few years ago, we made major changes

460
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:00,587
to the game's combat system, and this alienated a portion

461
00:20:00,607 --> 00:20:01,688
of players at the time.

462
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:06,992
So last year, we added a legacy combat mode

463
00:20:07,052 --> 00:20:09,054
that sat alongside the newer one.

464
00:20:09,414 --> 00:20:12,616
So those that preferred the traditional combat gameplay

465
00:20:12,737 --> 00:20:14,738
and interfaces could go back to using those.

466
00:20:15,819 --> 00:20:17,580
It meant that they didn't have to learn completely

467
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,822
new systems, and in doing so, it opened the door

468
00:20:19,982 --> 00:20:21,824
to a large number of returning players.

469
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:25,657
This is a topic I'll come back to a bit later in the presentation.

470
00:20:27,238 --> 00:20:28,579
Another approach is to go big.

471
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,461
Do something that's really attention-grabbing,

472
00:20:30,861 --> 00:20:33,163
something that's significant in the context of your game,

473
00:20:33,503 --> 00:20:35,545
has something fresh and interesting and new about it.

474
00:20:36,705 --> 00:20:41,308
We did this with some big world events inside RuneScape back in 2013.

475
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:46,972
These were large-scale but time-limited events that all players across all servers could join in,

476
00:20:47,492 --> 00:20:50,474
and their actions decided the fate of a massive God vs. God battle

477
00:20:50,754 --> 00:20:53,556
that took place across the iconic cities of the game world.

478
00:20:54,276 --> 00:20:56,718
And it also included a new type of gameplay for RuneScape,

479
00:20:57,178 --> 00:21:00,080
free-form, open-world PvP with territory capture.

480
00:21:01,573 --> 00:21:03,975
And it was this scale and the interest

481
00:21:04,015 --> 00:21:06,377
of the new gameplay concepts that enticed lapsed players

482
00:21:06,438 --> 00:21:09,100
back to check it out in quite large volumes.

483
00:21:11,462 --> 00:21:14,165
My last example is about playing on the nostalgia factor,

484
00:21:14,485 --> 00:21:17,268
tapping into fond memories and offering those experiences

485
00:21:17,588 --> 00:21:18,289
to players again.

486
00:21:19,855 --> 00:21:22,916
In early 2013, we did a poll to gauge players' interest

487
00:21:22,996 --> 00:21:25,156
in having a retro server of RuneScape,

488
00:21:25,196 --> 00:21:26,517
a much older build of the game.

489
00:21:27,217 --> 00:21:29,558
And for many players, this was their formative experience

490
00:21:29,598 --> 00:21:31,958
of online games, and they considered this period

491
00:21:32,078 --> 00:21:34,319
in the game's history to be like a golden age.

492
00:21:34,699 --> 00:21:36,500
It was a time when things were much simpler,

493
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,660
much sparser, and much more difficult.

494
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:42,421
This brought back many hundreds of thousands of players,

495
00:21:42,941 --> 00:21:45,362
and even a few years later, it continues to be

496
00:21:45,442 --> 00:21:47,603
a small but really dedicated part of our community.

497
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:52,826
we found that the timing of game updates

498
00:21:52,906 --> 00:21:54,927
can be just as important as their content.

499
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,269
By understanding the activity trends of returners,

500
00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:01,350
you can choose the optimal point to publish your game updates

501
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:04,971
when lapsed players are most likely to listen and respond.

502
00:22:07,945 --> 00:22:13,049
This chart shows an annual view of the average return rates for RuneScape across the last five years.

503
00:22:13,829 --> 00:22:19,533
You can see clearly there's really big surges in June and July and then again in September, sorry, in December.

504
00:22:20,474 --> 00:22:25,497
And this is because many of our players are college students and they have more free time during the seasonal holidays

505
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:29,019
and we really see these noticeable differences in early summer and Christmas.

506
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:33,954
We now purposefully attempt to time the release of windback features

507
00:22:34,414 --> 00:22:38,620
to coincide with these expected lifts in seasonal returners.

508
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:42,615
And RuneScape has quite pronounced seasonality

509
00:22:42,655 --> 00:22:44,737
across the year, but we also find similar patterns

510
00:22:45,077 --> 00:22:46,358
on smaller scales as well.

511
00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:49,841
So if we zoom in, these charts show the average return rate

512
00:22:49,981 --> 00:22:52,343
across a week, and this time we've split it

513
00:22:52,383 --> 00:22:54,645
so you can see the different patterns between off-season

514
00:22:55,186 --> 00:22:56,767
and the peak holiday period.

515
00:22:56,847 --> 00:22:58,888
So on the left, you can see on the off-season,

516
00:22:59,009 --> 00:23:00,950
it's the weekend that has the most returners,

517
00:23:01,491 --> 00:23:03,552
but for the peak season, during holidays,

518
00:23:03,812 --> 00:23:05,474
it's actually Fridays that gets the most.

519
00:23:06,653 --> 00:23:08,876
From a marketing perspective, these day-to-day patterns

520
00:23:08,936 --> 00:23:11,378
are useful when choosing when you want to announce stuff

521
00:23:11,578 --> 00:23:13,260
or when you want to pulse advertising.

522
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,562
But they're also useful from a design perspective.

523
00:23:16,143 --> 00:23:18,725
It really helps decide when's the best times to start

524
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:19,946
and finish your in-game events.

525
00:23:20,547 --> 00:23:22,288
So for instance, you're not going to want to end an event

526
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:24,511
just at the time lots of returning people

527
00:23:24,531 --> 00:23:25,471
are coming back to the game.

528
00:23:28,847 --> 00:23:31,570
So seasonality and activity trends for returners

529
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,291
are going to be different for every game, of course.

530
00:23:33,331 --> 00:23:35,313
So I recommend you dig into your data,

531
00:23:35,793 --> 00:23:37,995
find out when you naturally have more returning players,

532
00:23:38,395 --> 00:23:39,716
and build that into your plans.

533
00:23:41,438 --> 00:23:44,120
And you don't just have to do big content or feature updates

534
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:44,881
to motivate them.

535
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:48,484
On a smaller scale, we found that holiday and seasonal

536
00:23:48,524 --> 00:23:51,266
events like Halloween and Easter are also consistently

537
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:54,349
good at encouraging inactive players to revisit the game.

538
00:23:56,024 --> 00:23:58,348
But for what it's worth, the things, the smaller stuff like

539
00:23:58,889 --> 00:24:02,033
Valentines and July the 4th, while they're good for in-game events,

540
00:24:02,093 --> 00:24:04,677
for active players, we've not found them significant enough

541
00:24:04,757 --> 00:24:06,380
to bring back more returners.

542
00:24:08,797 --> 00:24:10,197
Okay, so next chapter.

543
00:24:10,898 --> 00:24:13,339
At this point, we've encouraged Laps player

544
00:24:13,379 --> 00:24:14,299
to return to the game,

545
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,201
but they now need to get reacquainted with how to play.

546
00:24:17,821 --> 00:24:19,041
And this is particularly challenging

547
00:24:19,081 --> 00:24:21,743
because the player remembers they had a mastery of the game,

548
00:24:21,943 --> 00:24:23,463
but they don't remember all the details.

549
00:24:23,804 --> 00:24:25,805
They can feel like a newbie in veterans' clothing.

550
00:24:25,825 --> 00:24:27,926
So you've got to help them overcome this

551
00:24:28,146 --> 00:24:30,787
and shortcut them back to becoming this expert.

552
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,237
And it's made more difficult by the fact

553
00:24:33,257 --> 00:24:34,578
that each returner is different.

554
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:37,058
The longer they've been away, the more they've forgotten.

555
00:24:37,378 --> 00:24:38,718
But also, the more changes they'll

556
00:24:38,738 --> 00:24:40,199
have missed during their absence.

557
00:24:43,639 --> 00:24:45,280
So I definitely recommend providing

558
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,380
some sort of catch-up learning features targeted or built

559
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,440
for returning players.

560
00:24:49,901 --> 00:24:52,101
It could be as simple as prompting them

561
00:24:52,141 --> 00:24:54,521
to replay a cut-down tutorial or turning

562
00:24:54,581 --> 00:24:56,282
on some sort of contextual help system.

563
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,362
We've tried a range of things on RuneScape,

564
00:24:58,442 --> 00:24:58,942
and I'll show you.

565
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:01,661
a bad example and then a better one.

566
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:11,192
In mid-2013, we did a bit of a relaunch of the game under the badge of RuneScape 3, and

567
00:25:11,232 --> 00:25:16,478
we added a bunch of new features, content, graphics, a new UI system, and we created

568
00:25:16,518 --> 00:25:20,022
this helper feature that popped up when a returning player logged in.

569
00:25:20,816 --> 00:25:24,960
It had 11 pages that summarized a whole bunch of changes.

570
00:25:25,841 --> 00:25:28,123
And you can probably guess that most players closed it immediately.

571
00:25:28,143 --> 00:25:29,664
It didn't grab their attention,

572
00:25:30,024 --> 00:25:32,827
and I didn't want to read and memorize all this generic information.

573
00:25:34,647 --> 00:25:36,408
So last year we tried to learn from this

574
00:25:36,828 --> 00:25:38,609
and improve on several fronts.

575
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:41,570
We created this learning hub for returning players.

576
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:45,072
It had dynamic elements that looked at the character's level

577
00:25:45,372 --> 00:25:47,633
and recommended certain content based on that.

578
00:25:48,274 --> 00:25:49,894
It looked at how long the player had been away

579
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:52,195
and it showed them different catch-up information.

580
00:25:52,836 --> 00:25:54,877
And we created a gear guide that recommended

581
00:25:55,157 --> 00:25:57,158
the appropriate equipment for the player's level.

582
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,223
We also created a range of short but fun catch-up videos

583
00:26:01,303 --> 00:26:04,287
that covered a three to 18 month period of content updates,

584
00:26:04,727 --> 00:26:06,209
which we worked out was the sweet spot

585
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:07,911
for most of our returning players.

586
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:09,794
This all worked much better.

587
00:26:10,975 --> 00:26:12,597
We saw it in our commercial performance

588
00:26:12,777 --> 00:26:13,979
and we had a lot of good feedback

589
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,260
from returning players about it.

590
00:26:18,134 --> 00:26:20,597
So I recommend you try and use the information you've got

591
00:26:20,717 --> 00:26:23,460
about each player, especially the length of time

592
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,362
they've been away, to personalize

593
00:26:25,402 --> 00:26:26,604
their relearning process.

594
00:26:27,525 --> 00:26:30,288
If you can't do that, always try and make it as relevant,

595
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:33,091
as visual, and as entertaining as possible.

596
00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:37,010
And depending on the type of game you've got,

597
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,770
it might be worth considering what you can do

598
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:42,392
to lower the barrier for payment for returning players.

599
00:26:43,272 --> 00:26:45,053
Several MMOs, including RuneScape,

600
00:26:45,233 --> 00:26:47,594
have got tradable premium currency items.

601
00:26:48,074 --> 00:26:49,314
RuneScape's version is called Bonds.

602
00:26:49,855 --> 00:26:51,935
World of Warcraft announced they're adding this

603
00:26:52,215 --> 00:26:52,896
a few days ago.

604
00:26:54,356 --> 00:26:56,817
These are items where players can buy them from you

605
00:26:56,837 --> 00:26:57,577
for real money.

606
00:26:57,878 --> 00:26:59,238
They can trade them between each other

607
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,279
and then redeem the item for one of your paid services.

608
00:27:02,719 --> 00:27:04,800
In our case, that's mainly the membership subscription.

609
00:27:05,663 --> 00:27:07,964
Effectively, it means that your high spenders

610
00:27:08,104 --> 00:27:09,745
are subsidizing other players,

611
00:27:10,265 --> 00:27:12,606
and time-rich players can pay for everything

612
00:27:12,706 --> 00:27:13,866
using their in-game wealth.

613
00:27:15,447 --> 00:27:17,248
And this is especially relevant for returners,

614
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:19,188
because they're likely to be coming back to your game

615
00:27:19,428 --> 00:27:21,289
with an account that already has wealth on it.

616
00:27:21,989 --> 00:27:23,710
And in our case, they can use this wealth

617
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:26,231
to buy a bond from our auction house or from another player,

618
00:27:26,651 --> 00:27:28,491
redeem it for membership

619
00:27:28,691 --> 00:27:30,352
or one of our other premium currencies

620
00:27:30,632 --> 00:27:32,373
without needing to pay any real money.

621
00:27:35,138 --> 00:27:38,861
We introduced this in late 2013 and saw a really significant increase

622
00:27:39,222 --> 00:27:42,284
in the number of returning players getting membership subscription

623
00:27:42,645 --> 00:27:45,767
because they could effectively buy it using the wealth on their old account.

624
00:27:46,908 --> 00:27:49,571
I think this mechanic is really great for certain types of games,

625
00:27:50,071 --> 00:27:52,213
especially MMOs with open market economies.

626
00:27:52,794 --> 00:27:55,716
Now, there are lots of complexities and challenges here, of course.

627
00:27:56,277 --> 00:27:57,778
Least of all, the increased fraud risk.

628
00:27:58,479 --> 00:28:00,300
So, um, if it's relevant to you,

629
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,262
definitely, uh, investigate it.

630
00:28:02,362 --> 00:28:04,024
Feel free to e-mail me for more information,

631
00:28:04,044 --> 00:28:05,725
because, uh, if it's right for your game,

632
00:28:05,905 --> 00:28:07,386
it can be really, really helpful.

633
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:12,191
Okay, so next chapter.

634
00:28:12,211 --> 00:28:14,833
Um, now we want to get players

635
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,094
to stay for the longer term

636
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:18,516
and find ways to deepen their engagement

637
00:28:18,556 --> 00:28:19,016
with the game.

638
00:28:20,504 --> 00:28:23,106
Events have a range of benefits that help here.

639
00:28:23,766 --> 00:28:26,408
They focus players into certain areas of the game world,

640
00:28:26,709 --> 00:28:28,330
so they feel more lively and busy.

641
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:31,572
Time-limited events create a sense of urgency

642
00:28:31,612 --> 00:28:33,713
to participate, which also helps engagement.

643
00:28:34,474 --> 00:28:37,716
And these events are a talking point within the player base,

644
00:28:37,776 --> 00:28:40,518
so they create a reason to chat and a reason to socialize.

645
00:28:42,415 --> 00:28:44,476
These benefits are great for all types of players,

646
00:28:44,516 --> 00:28:46,597
but they're especially beneficial for returners

647
00:28:47,097 --> 00:28:49,517
because these are the players that are less resilient,

648
00:28:49,597 --> 00:28:51,378
they're yet to fully engage with your game,

649
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:54,099
and that means they're more vulnerable to churning out.

650
00:28:56,019 --> 00:28:58,920
So to be really effective, what you want to do is design events

651
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,701
by considering the specific needs of returning players.

652
00:29:03,982 --> 00:29:05,502
I've got two types of these events.

653
00:29:05,582 --> 00:29:07,683
The first one I call enrichment events.

654
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:12,922
These are when you're trying to deepen the engagement of returners who have lots of time available.

655
00:29:14,062 --> 00:29:17,644
These events should give players more stuff to do, encourage them to be social,

656
00:29:17,944 --> 00:29:20,265
provide more variety to stop them getting bored.

657
00:29:21,045 --> 00:29:24,086
We run these sort of events when the players' free time is higher,

658
00:29:24,246 --> 00:29:27,428
which, as I mentioned, was holidays around the summer and the winter.

659
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:30,919
The second type are upkeep events,

660
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,561
and this is when you're trying to reduce

661
00:29:33,741 --> 00:29:36,683
the disengagement of players who have limited time available,

662
00:29:37,064 --> 00:29:38,725
so it's the opposite situation.

663
00:29:39,886 --> 00:29:42,007
These events should require minimal time investment

664
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:44,849
from players and offer a lot of value for participating

665
00:29:45,369 --> 00:29:47,811
and ideally encourage players to log in every day,

666
00:29:48,011 --> 00:29:49,052
even if only briefly.

667
00:29:50,113 --> 00:29:51,874
We do these sorts of events in the leaner months

668
00:29:52,054 --> 00:29:54,236
of May and September when some of our players

669
00:29:54,276 --> 00:29:56,517
are busy with exams or starting a new school year.

670
00:29:57,475 --> 00:30:00,161
And it allows them to keep their connection with the game alive

671
00:30:00,221 --> 00:30:02,085
without needing to invest lots of time

672
00:30:02,325 --> 00:30:03,788
to feel like they're achieving something.

673
00:30:04,831 --> 00:30:06,354
I'll give you a couple of examples of these.

674
00:30:08,174 --> 00:30:10,396
The first is an enrichment event we ran in RuneScape

675
00:30:10,877 --> 00:30:12,298
for Christmas 2013.

676
00:30:12,498 --> 00:30:14,460
It was called Up to Snow Good.

677
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:17,443
And players had to complete simple mini games

678
00:30:17,503 --> 00:30:19,204
like snowball fights and reindeer herding.

679
00:30:19,585 --> 00:30:20,826
And they did this to score points

680
00:30:20,866 --> 00:30:23,728
that they could trade in for seasonal, festive rewards.

681
00:30:24,449 --> 00:30:26,891
It was seasonally themed, lightweight, social,

682
00:30:27,352 --> 00:30:28,773
and if players worked together,

683
00:30:28,913 --> 00:30:30,154
they could get their rewards faster,

684
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:33,237
so it encouraged them gently to team up and make friends.

685
00:30:34,603 --> 00:30:36,424
We found that participation in this event

686
00:30:36,484 --> 00:30:39,245
increased the likelihood of retaining a returning player

687
00:30:39,605 --> 00:30:43,107
after three months by 9%, so really quite significant.

688
00:30:44,147 --> 00:30:46,308
And as a holiday event, we knew that players' free time

689
00:30:46,348 --> 00:30:48,308
would be higher, so we designed it

690
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:51,530
to help returning players get deeper back into the game.

691
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:57,032
An example of an upkeep event is the September raffle

692
00:30:57,152 --> 00:30:58,272
that we ran last year.

693
00:31:01,718 --> 00:31:04,521
Well, here players could log in every day

694
00:31:04,741 --> 00:31:05,762
and they'd get a raffle ticket.

695
00:31:06,162 --> 00:31:07,463
They could then use these tickets

696
00:31:07,543 --> 00:31:09,105
to enter prize draws throughout the month

697
00:31:09,445 --> 00:31:11,106
to win highly desirable items.

698
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:13,388
And there was a bit of a deeper strategy

699
00:31:13,428 --> 00:31:15,390
where the players could decide to go all in

700
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,131
on that specific prize they wanted,

701
00:31:17,812 --> 00:31:19,954
or they could use their tickets more tactically

702
00:31:20,374 --> 00:31:22,136
to go into, spread their bets,

703
00:31:22,356 --> 00:31:23,597
go into less popular draws,

704
00:31:23,977 --> 00:31:26,019
so they'd be more likely of getting a prize overall.

705
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,167
We found that participation in this event

706
00:31:29,207 --> 00:31:32,250
increased the likelihood of retaining a returning player

707
00:31:32,551 --> 00:31:35,313
after three months by 11%, so even more effective.

708
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:38,577
By running an upkeep event in September,

709
00:31:38,637 --> 00:31:40,919
we're increasing the amount of our summer returners

710
00:31:41,239 --> 00:31:43,181
we retain as we go into the leaner month.

711
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:45,203
So it's quite a strategic use of content.

712
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:51,712
These sort of events are great, but you do need to be cautious not to oversaturate the game with them.

713
00:31:52,512 --> 00:31:55,173
We found that a one month in free ratio works quite well.

714
00:31:55,273 --> 00:31:57,154
Normally our events last a month.

715
00:31:57,854 --> 00:32:02,776
And this provides enough event coverage but without burning out your regular players.

716
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:06,577
Because these sort of events can be quite draining for the people that are playing all of the time.

717
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:09,018
Obviously this is very dependent on...

718
00:32:09,424 --> 00:32:11,325
the type of game, the nature of your community,

719
00:32:12,085 --> 00:32:12,905
even the platform.

720
00:32:13,085 --> 00:32:15,706
I see a lot of mobile games with weekly or fortnightly events,

721
00:32:15,746 --> 00:32:17,987
so they've obviously worked out that's optimal for them.

722
00:32:21,188 --> 00:32:22,368
Okay, so final chapter now.

723
00:32:23,449 --> 00:32:25,289
So far, I've proposed a range of

724
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,130
quite specific features or techniques,

725
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,151
so in this section, I wanted to talk more

726
00:32:29,391 --> 00:32:31,171
about general principles about

727
00:32:31,231 --> 00:32:33,292
considering the needs of returning players.

728
00:32:34,743 --> 00:32:36,424
Managing the rate of change in online games

729
00:32:36,484 --> 00:32:38,685
is really difficult because it's impossible not

730
00:32:38,745 --> 00:32:40,626
to want to improve and modernize,

731
00:32:40,746 --> 00:32:42,587
especially as your game starts to show its age.

732
00:32:43,368 --> 00:32:45,449
The challenge is to balance two competing forces,

733
00:32:45,629 --> 00:32:48,011
the benefits you'd get from modernizing the game,

734
00:32:48,371 --> 00:32:49,572
but also the benefits you're getting

735
00:32:49,632 --> 00:32:52,433
from keeping it familiar and comfortable for players.

736
00:32:53,474 --> 00:32:55,415
The risk is that if you change the game too much,

737
00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:58,557
you can alienate players who liked it how it was.

738
00:32:58,797 --> 00:33:01,579
And that's both for existing and returning players.

739
00:33:02,651 --> 00:33:06,673
In my experience, the biggest risk is trying to modernize the core systems of the game

740
00:33:07,113 --> 00:33:08,294
rather than adding more content.

741
00:33:09,674 --> 00:33:14,456
And I really learned this lesson with RuneScape's 2012 Evolution of Combat update.

742
00:33:14,856 --> 00:33:19,619
We felt we needed to overhaul a core gameplay system to keep the game relevant and to continue

743
00:33:19,659 --> 00:33:21,099
to attract new players.

744
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:25,801
And there was data to support this because our survey results and onboarding metrics

745
00:33:25,861 --> 00:33:30,123
pointed to the somewhat simple low-intensity combat system as a bit of a weak point.

746
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:34,131
but we overlooked the impact it would have on returning players.

747
00:33:34,853 --> 00:33:39,183
We failed in two ways. Firstly, the system itself was too radical a change all at once,

748
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,368
and secondly, it was introduced poorly.

749
00:33:43,998 --> 00:33:45,418
After the new combat system launched,

750
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:48,399
players were greeted by this pop-up when they logged in.

751
00:33:48,939 --> 00:33:51,360
Messy UI, two paragraphs of solid text,

752
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,640
no useful visuals, only a small call-to-action button.

753
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,661
And if you did click that, you were

754
00:33:56,701 --> 00:34:00,122
led to a tutorial that lasted 30 minutes, that honestly

755
00:34:00,162 --> 00:34:01,462
was more functional than fun.

756
00:34:02,002 --> 00:34:04,223
And worst of all, because some of the item and gear

757
00:34:04,263 --> 00:34:06,123
requirements had changed, players

758
00:34:06,303 --> 00:34:07,743
had all of their items unequipped

759
00:34:07,923 --> 00:34:09,244
and had to fumble around with their gear

760
00:34:09,504 --> 00:34:10,464
before they could continue.

761
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:12,518
So, really not good.

762
00:34:13,038 --> 00:34:15,079
And you can tell that returning players

763
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:17,380
weren't a big consideration for us here,

764
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,241
and we felt the consequences of that.

765
00:34:19,841 --> 00:34:21,142
You can see on this chart that

766
00:34:21,362 --> 00:34:23,503
the return rate after the launch of the combat,

767
00:34:23,683 --> 00:34:24,583
the new combat system,

768
00:34:25,004 --> 00:34:27,024
doesn't get the normal seasonal rise.

769
00:34:27,045 --> 00:34:29,346
So there's a difference between the red and the blue there.

770
00:34:30,646 --> 00:34:33,988
For some returners, the change was simply too great all at once,

771
00:34:34,268 --> 00:34:35,949
and they simply stopped coming back.

772
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,711
And we were fortunate we were able to recover this

773
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:41,552
with the legacy combat mode I mentioned earlier.

774
00:34:42,173 --> 00:34:43,934
But honestly, if we'd made better decisions,

775
00:34:44,334 --> 00:34:45,174
it wouldn't have been needed,

776
00:34:45,235 --> 00:34:47,516
and we could have put that effort into other things.

777
00:34:50,594 --> 00:34:55,121
By contrast, in early 2012, we launched a feature that could have been similarly disruptive.

778
00:34:55,501 --> 00:34:56,863
It was called the Squeal of Fortune.

779
00:34:57,324 --> 00:35:02,672
It was a mystery box style minigame where you could spin a prize wheel, get things like

780
00:35:02,832 --> 00:35:05,416
in-game resources, XP boosts, or currency.

781
00:35:07,027 --> 00:35:11,209
It was a daily login incentives where players were given a couple of free spins every day,

782
00:35:11,649 --> 00:35:16,092
but they could also buy additional spins as a microtransaction option.

783
00:35:16,492 --> 00:35:20,033
And this was the first time, to that point in the game's ten-year history,

784
00:35:20,093 --> 00:35:23,775
when payments beyond the subscription could get you any sort of benefit.

785
00:35:24,616 --> 00:35:26,156
And it did cause quite a stir,

786
00:35:26,236 --> 00:35:27,257
and there were some complaints,

787
00:35:28,077 --> 00:35:30,838
but it actually had zero impact on either our existing

788
00:35:30,958 --> 00:35:32,259
or our returning player numbers.

789
00:35:32,279 --> 00:35:34,840
And I believe this was because it fundamentally

790
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,561
didn't change the core of the game.

791
00:35:37,181 --> 00:35:39,042
While some players didn't like it in principle,

792
00:35:39,422 --> 00:35:42,184
it was in reality a fairly mild implementation

793
00:35:42,264 --> 00:35:43,184
of an MTX feature,

794
00:35:43,464 --> 00:35:45,045
and it didn't change the way people played.

795
00:35:46,266 --> 00:35:47,986
So, of course, you can make changes.

796
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:49,487
You can make big changes,

797
00:35:49,727 --> 00:35:51,548
even deep into a product's lifecycle.

798
00:35:51,928 --> 00:35:53,709
But I think caution is needed.

799
00:35:55,475 --> 00:35:57,736
So my recommendations for managing change are

800
00:35:58,516 --> 00:36:01,117
to alter core gameplay at your peril.

801
00:36:01,677 --> 00:36:03,098
Undermining the player's mastery,

802
00:36:03,518 --> 00:36:04,699
devaluing their achievements,

803
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:06,939
or altering how they fundamentally approach the game

804
00:36:06,979 --> 00:36:09,740
can be disastrous if not handled really carefully.

805
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,811
When you're considering a big change,

806
00:36:12,991 --> 00:36:15,833
do thorough research and testing across all types of players,

807
00:36:15,913 --> 00:36:18,436
not just those you're targeting with a specific feature.

808
00:36:19,216 --> 00:36:22,319
Give yourself enough time to test and iterate before launch,

809
00:36:22,759 --> 00:36:25,321
and give yourself the option to change course

810
00:36:25,361 --> 00:36:26,723
if you're seeing warning signals.

811
00:36:28,784 --> 00:36:30,926
Also, be on the lookout for cumulative change.

812
00:36:31,567 --> 00:36:33,048
Again, RuneScape is on the extreme end

813
00:36:33,088 --> 00:36:34,689
because we update pretty much every week,

814
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,571
but it's something you should keep an eye on

815
00:36:36,691 --> 00:36:38,372
even if you've got a lower update cadence.

816
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,741
I recommend not just looking at the change per release,

817
00:36:42,021 --> 00:36:44,523
but looking at how it's adding up over a longer period.

818
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:48,305
And if you are making a big change,

819
00:36:48,525 --> 00:36:50,126
consider whether you can add some sort

820
00:36:50,206 --> 00:36:51,527
of backwards compatibility.

821
00:36:52,147 --> 00:36:53,648
I mentioned earlier how we re-added

822
00:36:53,688 --> 00:36:56,790
RuneScape's old combat and UI in alternate legacy mode.

823
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:59,211
And I wish we'd included that in the first place.

824
00:37:02,802 --> 00:37:04,983
Managing community sentiment is just as important

825
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:08,624
because player satisfaction has a real impact on returners.

826
00:37:09,465 --> 00:37:12,666
If the player base are annoyed and outraged,

827
00:37:12,746 --> 00:37:14,447
there's going to be less positive word of mouth

828
00:37:14,867 --> 00:37:16,888
reaching lapsed players outside the game,

829
00:37:17,408 --> 00:37:19,949
and that's going to reduce the number of them likely to return.

830
00:37:21,249 --> 00:37:23,230
And inside the game, negative sentiment

831
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:24,551
turns into toxic chatter,

832
00:37:25,011 --> 00:37:26,391
and that won't be pleasant for the returners

833
00:37:26,431 --> 00:37:27,812
who have made it back into the game,

834
00:37:27,952 --> 00:37:29,693
and it will harm their re-engagement.

835
00:37:30,879 --> 00:37:34,322
To stay on top of these risks, I recommend finding ways

836
00:37:34,742 --> 00:37:36,524
to track community sentiment, to stay

837
00:37:36,564 --> 00:37:37,785
aware of how players are feeling,

838
00:37:38,545 --> 00:37:40,267
and use it to calibrate your design decisions

839
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:41,347
to do things about it.

840
00:37:42,548 --> 00:37:43,970
And we use a number of methods for this,

841
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:46,872
but I'll show you two of the most relevant ones.

842
00:37:47,773 --> 00:37:50,555
This first one is a weekly community sentiment report

843
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:53,037
that's put together by our community management team.

844
00:37:53,797 --> 00:37:56,199
It talks about how the players are reacting to that week's

845
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:57,640
new content and events.

846
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:02,105
It shows the split of opinion from players across their game,

847
00:38:02,225 --> 00:38:05,266
our forums, social media, and it calls out specific issues

848
00:38:05,646 --> 00:38:07,507
and makes recommendations for addressing them.

849
00:38:08,028 --> 00:38:10,089
This gives us a really good short-term view

850
00:38:10,189 --> 00:38:11,430
of the issues, the sentiment,

851
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:14,031
and allows us to react quickly when we need to.

852
00:38:16,641 --> 00:38:18,742
The other method is a much longer form

853
00:38:18,842 --> 00:38:20,383
customer satisfaction tracker.

854
00:38:21,003 --> 00:38:22,484
We survey our players every month

855
00:38:22,604 --> 00:38:24,565
to see what they think about the game and the service,

856
00:38:25,066 --> 00:38:28,547
and it allows us to see the importance of each sub area

857
00:38:28,808 --> 00:38:30,889
and how much it affects their future behaviors.

858
00:38:31,369 --> 00:38:33,590
So this type of analysis allows us to measure

859
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:36,192
the business impact of player sentiment

860
00:38:36,552 --> 00:38:37,792
and how it affects things like

861
00:38:37,912 --> 00:38:39,553
recommendations and word of mouth.

862
00:38:41,343 --> 00:38:43,965
So maybe it's obvious, but this shows empirically

863
00:38:44,846 --> 00:38:47,227
keeping your customers happy is good for the bottom line.

864
00:38:47,788 --> 00:38:50,730
And it will help you in getting and keeping

865
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:52,411
more returning players.

866
00:38:52,431 --> 00:38:57,855
I've gone through quite a lot today, so I'll wrap up

867
00:38:58,116 --> 00:38:59,737
and recap on the key points.

868
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:03,620
Returners are increasingly important as your game ages.

869
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:06,142
So start building them into your design considerations

870
00:39:06,322 --> 00:39:07,343
as early as you can.

871
00:39:08,859 --> 00:39:13,002
Utilize social media as a way to communicate with LAPS players on their terms.

872
00:39:13,442 --> 00:39:18,085
Don't just rely on email, and empower players to get the word out on your behalf.

873
00:39:19,706 --> 00:39:23,990
Try to have some game updates designed specifically around the needs of LAPS players,

874
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:28,393
and then launch these at the start of seasonal uplifts in Returners.

875
00:39:30,394 --> 00:39:32,776
Help Returners regain their mastery of the game.

876
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:34,457
Don't just leave them to get on with it alone,

877
00:39:35,058 --> 00:39:37,920
and ideally find ways to give them personalized catch-up.

878
00:39:40,338 --> 00:39:42,619
When you've got them playing, deepen their engagement

879
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:43,960
with special community events,

880
00:39:44,141 --> 00:39:45,782
which are designed sympathetically

881
00:39:46,042 --> 00:39:47,263
to their available time.

882
00:39:49,064 --> 00:39:51,406
And manage the rate of change cautiously,

883
00:39:51,966 --> 00:39:53,287
especially in core gameplay.

884
00:39:53,947 --> 00:39:55,328
Keep track of community sentiment

885
00:39:55,468 --> 00:39:56,829
and use it to guide your decisions

886
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:59,952
and always keep players as happy as possible.

887
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:04,435
Right. That's the end of the talk.

888
00:40:04,755 --> 00:40:06,156
Thank you so much for coming along today.

889
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:19,842
Please feel free to email me if you want to get a hold of these slides or ask any, get

890
00:40:19,882 --> 00:40:20,822
some more info on anything.

891
00:40:21,283 --> 00:40:24,304
And we can now open the floor up to questions if anyone has any.

892
00:40:24,664 --> 00:40:26,665
There's mics in all of the aisles.

893
00:40:26,685 --> 00:40:28,886
You mentioned you had a companion app.

894
00:40:28,906 --> 00:40:31,807
Do you use this in any way to re-engage customers?

895
00:40:32,387 --> 00:40:34,608
Does it affect lapsed customer behavior?

896
00:40:34,628 --> 00:40:39,290
Do you see people who stop playing RuneScape but still use the companion app to do any

897
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:40,590
engagement activity?

898
00:40:41,034 --> 00:40:42,694
So the question was about our companion app

899
00:40:42,734 --> 00:40:44,475
and whether it's helped get more returners.

900
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:47,116
Not significantly is the answer.

901
00:40:47,156 --> 00:40:49,576
The companion app's very much about extending the game

902
00:40:49,636 --> 00:40:51,417
experience slightly outside, well,

903
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,057
outside of the venue of the game client.

904
00:40:53,857 --> 00:40:56,638
And the features are very much only really relevant

905
00:40:56,658 --> 00:40:58,078
to very active core players.

906
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:01,219
So there might have been some halo effect from it,

907
00:41:01,339 --> 00:41:03,820
but not one that we've been able to measure when we've looked.

908
00:41:06,225 --> 00:41:11,550
Hi there. Your $3 cost of acquiring the returning users, does that include development cost

909
00:41:11,851 --> 00:41:16,075
or community management posting on Reddit, etc., or is that just on...

910
00:41:16,335 --> 00:41:20,979
No, that's just paid. So the question was, do our costs for user acquisition that I showed

911
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:26,044
include anything other than, well, just the raw finance cost. No, that is just, that's

912
00:41:26,064 --> 00:41:26,505
just spend.

913
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:27,566
Thanks.

914
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:35,903
Could you cite some specific examples from your slide about how you engage in the different social platforms versus your email success?

915
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:39,344
Obviously the Reddit and the YouTube and stuff was significantly more successful.

916
00:41:39,704 --> 00:41:42,245
Can you tell us a little bit about the stuff that is successful?

917
00:41:42,305 --> 00:41:44,905
I'm concerned about Reddit in particular, but all of it.

918
00:41:45,005 --> 00:41:46,446
Like, what's the stuff you do that works well?

919
00:41:47,474 --> 00:41:51,918
The question was about more information on our social channels and why they work well.

920
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:53,600
That's a really good question.

921
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,922
I'm not sure of quite the right answer.

922
00:41:56,002 --> 00:42:01,166
I think there's just natural, sort of a natural dynamic about each of the social media channels

923
00:42:01,206 --> 00:42:02,728
that makes it more or less relevant to...

924
00:42:03,528 --> 00:42:05,309
the characteristics of your player base.

925
00:42:06,389 --> 00:42:08,370
Reddit's quite discussion-orientated,

926
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:11,110
and our players definitely are very opinionated.

927
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:12,971
I know everyone says that, but, like, trust me,

928
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:13,851
our guys really are.

929
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:17,152
I think it's also a place where people pass through

930
00:42:17,172 --> 00:42:17,792
a lot more.

931
00:42:18,352 --> 00:42:20,653
There's a lot of interlinking inside Reddit,

932
00:42:20,753 --> 00:42:23,234
and I think that you don't quite get the same thing

933
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:24,854
on something like Facebook.

934
00:42:24,874 --> 00:42:26,735
You do a bit on Twitter, but I'm not sure Twitter

935
00:42:26,995 --> 00:42:28,975
triggers returners in quite the same way.

936
00:42:30,516 --> 00:42:32,056
Yeah, I don't have much more than that, I'm afraid.

937
00:42:33,782 --> 00:42:33,902
Hi.

938
00:42:34,903 --> 00:42:39,848
So, after you introduced the token system that allowed your returners that had the old

939
00:42:39,908 --> 00:42:44,213
wealth that you were talking about to purchase subscriptions with their old wealth, did you

940
00:42:44,253 --> 00:42:50,639
then find that later, them having access to those premium services would give them a taste

941
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:54,263
of what they could get if they paid and then became payers afterwards?

942
00:42:54,963 --> 00:42:58,805
So the question was about our bond system that allows players to get stuff,

943
00:42:59,325 --> 00:43:01,626
premium stuff with their gold, their in-game currency.

944
00:43:02,326 --> 00:43:06,128
It's a bit of a feeder mechanism, so outside of Returners specifically,

945
00:43:06,828 --> 00:43:11,930
having a tradable premium currency item is really good just as a taster feeder mechanism

946
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:15,011
for all players, so we have seen that it's increased the conversion.

947
00:43:16,112 --> 00:43:17,012
for players in general.

948
00:43:17,672 --> 00:43:20,293
I couldn't say specifically about the sub-cohort

949
00:43:20,713 --> 00:43:22,693
for returners specifically, but we

950
00:43:22,713 --> 00:43:25,354
do see that dynamic across the player base.

951
00:43:28,774 --> 00:43:32,315
I'm just wondering if you have a forum where

952
00:43:32,355 --> 00:43:35,316
players can discuss, basically, things with you

953
00:43:35,376 --> 00:43:35,956
and with each other.

954
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:39,137
And do you have that in addition to Reddit and Facebook,

955
00:43:39,237 --> 00:43:40,577
or did you just pick one or the other?

956
00:43:41,234 --> 00:43:42,794
Yeah, no, we've got really big forums.

957
00:43:42,834 --> 00:43:44,775
There was a while, a few years ago now,

958
00:43:44,815 --> 00:43:48,437
where our forums were one of the largest traffic

959
00:43:48,477 --> 00:43:49,377
sources in the UK.

960
00:43:50,177 --> 00:43:53,679
Not quite now, because it's a lot more spread out.

961
00:43:53,939 --> 00:43:55,460
But we've always had forums, and they've always

962
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,000
had tons of activity.

963
00:43:57,861 --> 00:43:59,482
They still have more activity than Reddit,

964
00:43:59,782 --> 00:44:01,843
but in terms of players flowing in,

965
00:44:02,083 --> 00:44:03,343
our forums are a bit of a bubble,

966
00:44:03,603 --> 00:44:06,445
whereas Reddit has a lot of general traffic coming

967
00:44:06,505 --> 00:44:06,885
through it.

968
00:44:07,485 --> 00:44:10,887
So it's a bit more relevant for catching returning players.

969
00:44:14,153 --> 00:44:22,064
You mentioned a case where you introduced some change that caused a stir and negative response, but didn't have an effect on the players.

970
00:44:22,524 --> 00:44:30,395
Have you found any patterns where you know something will cause drama, but won't cause a drop in numbers, and vice versa?

971
00:44:31,381 --> 00:44:33,482
The question was about the difference between features

972
00:44:33,542 --> 00:44:35,723
that might cause a stir but don't change,

973
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:38,164
like, player activity or subscription numbers.

974
00:44:38,725 --> 00:44:41,626
I mean, I'm coming to this stuff retrospectively, of course.

975
00:44:41,666 --> 00:44:43,187
Like, you can probably tell that we didn't have

976
00:44:43,207 --> 00:44:44,568
all this wisdom in the first place.

977
00:44:46,395 --> 00:44:48,397
I can really just go back to the stuff I was talking about

978
00:44:48,417 --> 00:44:49,438
in terms of best practice.

979
00:44:50,158 --> 00:44:52,020
We do a lot more pre-research now.

980
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:54,602
When we launched that legacy mode that I talked about,

981
00:44:54,642 --> 00:44:56,984
we flew about 40 players into our studio,

982
00:44:57,324 --> 00:44:58,725
took them through the concept of it,

983
00:44:58,765 --> 00:45:00,126
allowed them to play an early version,

984
00:45:00,146 --> 00:45:02,008
because we knew it would be quite controversial,

985
00:45:02,388 --> 00:45:04,049
not among the people we'd alienated,

986
00:45:04,089 --> 00:45:05,730
but of the people that were still playing

987
00:45:05,771 --> 00:45:06,591
and liked the new thing.

988
00:45:06,611 --> 00:45:07,192
So...

989
00:45:09,693 --> 00:45:11,033
I think we're getting a better feel for it,

990
00:45:11,133 --> 00:45:14,674
but research, just communication with your player base,

991
00:45:14,694 --> 00:45:17,475
being really honest with them,

992
00:45:17,495 --> 00:45:18,455
that's the way we've...

993
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:20,876
what we've done to get better at that.

994
00:45:23,236 --> 00:45:23,917
man 3 in audience Hi.

995
00:45:23,937 --> 00:45:26,657
I'm curious how you prioritize developer time

996
00:45:26,717 --> 00:45:29,198
for some of these extra solutions that you come up with

997
00:45:29,238 --> 00:45:31,158
for returners versus giving the player...

998
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:33,419
your existing players something new and shiny, basically.

999
00:45:34,163 --> 00:45:36,745
So the question was about how we prioritize and divide time

1000
00:45:36,785 --> 00:45:40,368
between content for our regular players versus returners.

1001
00:45:41,769 --> 00:45:44,791
What we try and do is create a fairly sizable update

1002
00:45:45,491 --> 00:45:49,254
at each of those returner peaks, so early summer and Christmas.

1003
00:45:49,334 --> 00:45:52,136
And we kind of do events in Halloween

1004
00:45:52,176 --> 00:45:53,657
as a smaller version of that.

1005
00:45:54,157 --> 00:45:54,937
That's probably.

1006
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,821
I don't know, like a fifth or a sixth of our overall resource.

1007
00:45:59,161 --> 00:46:02,542
Because we have, we've got a really big team and company,

1008
00:46:02,582 --> 00:46:05,363
so we're a very, very content-driven game.

1009
00:46:05,643 --> 00:46:07,023
So we release something every week.

1010
00:46:07,503 --> 00:46:09,644
So if there's maybe three weeks of the year

1011
00:46:09,804 --> 00:46:12,125
where we're releasing a fairly big update for returners,

1012
00:46:12,405 --> 00:46:15,486
that still pales in comparison to all of the other content

1013
00:46:15,546 --> 00:46:17,866
that we're pushing out every week for everyone else.

1014
00:46:17,906 --> 00:46:19,367
So it's still a small minority.

1015
00:46:22,168 --> 00:46:25,709
You mentioned a lot of things ranging from game design to community management.

1016
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:30,091
Where is the line drawn between this is the community management's job for getting return player,

1017
00:46:30,131 --> 00:46:33,092
this is something we need somebody to design an event for?

1018
00:46:33,212 --> 00:46:35,092
How do you differentiate between the different roles?

1019
00:46:35,572 --> 00:46:39,613
Or do you have a specific team just for retention and getting returners?

1020
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:43,059
So the question was about where the line between community

1021
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:45,901
management and development and design falls.

1022
00:46:46,361 --> 00:46:48,842
We've really benefited from integrating our teams.

1023
00:46:48,882 --> 00:46:50,943
There are separate teams for community management.

1024
00:46:51,224 --> 00:46:53,425
We have a community development team,

1025
00:46:53,505 --> 00:46:55,546
who are kind of a mixture of developers and community

1026
00:46:55,586 --> 00:46:55,986
managers.

1027
00:46:56,367 --> 00:46:59,128
And then we have retention-orientated development

1028
00:46:59,168 --> 00:46:59,849
teams as well.

1029
00:47:00,249 --> 00:47:02,250
We try and get everyone to mix as much as possible.

1030
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:05,012
But ultimately, it's the, and we have

1031
00:47:05,052 --> 00:47:06,953
loads of our developers on Twitter and things like that.

1032
00:47:07,253 --> 00:47:09,054
But ultimately, it's the community manager's job.

1033
00:47:09,394 --> 00:47:13,499
official job to do the official communication, run events, that kind of thing.

1034
00:47:13,959 --> 00:47:18,444
And for our developers, it's more of a thing we like to encourage them to do and that they

1035
00:47:18,505 --> 00:47:19,766
actually really enjoy as well.

1036
00:47:21,403 --> 00:47:23,445
But I suppose in reality, the lines

1037
00:47:23,485 --> 00:47:24,506
are the ones you'd expect.

1038
00:47:24,566 --> 00:47:27,169
But we have our developers sitting right next

1039
00:47:27,189 --> 00:47:28,130
to our community managers.

1040
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:31,854
We've really improved things by integrating our publishing

1041
00:47:31,894 --> 00:47:34,577
and development functions to sit right next to each other

1042
00:47:34,657 --> 00:47:36,639
and talk a lot and plan a lot together.

1043
00:47:37,059 --> 00:47:40,183
So we try and blur the line, but it's also probably

1044
00:47:40,203 --> 00:47:40,983
where you expect it to be.

1045
00:47:43,239 --> 00:47:49,784
Hi, how much work do you guys do around the old school servers in terms of like events

1046
00:47:49,845 --> 00:47:57,711
that you keep pace with the normal servers or do you just do small bug fixes and things

1047
00:47:57,731 --> 00:48:00,113
like that and then how big is the team dedicated to old school?

1048
00:48:01,594 --> 00:48:04,736
So the question was about the attention we put into our retro servers.

1049
00:48:06,497 --> 00:48:08,558
So it's a lot smaller than that of the main game.

1050
00:48:08,578 --> 00:48:12,081
It's a really dedicated, so we treat it as a sub-product

1051
00:48:12,761 --> 00:48:15,903
in the way that we have sub-retention teams and technology teams.

1052
00:48:16,283 --> 00:48:20,506
It's a legit team of its own that's fully resourced, but smaller than that of the main team.

1053
00:48:20,946 --> 00:48:22,888
They run all their own events, they have their own content.

1054
00:48:23,837 --> 00:48:25,058
There's, it's interesting actually,

1055
00:48:25,138 --> 00:48:26,379
when you do a retro service,

1056
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:28,440
part of the reason it's there

1057
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,602
is to provide this old way of playing

1058
00:48:30,722 --> 00:48:33,183
and this kind of, there's a natural conservatism about it.

1059
00:48:33,484 --> 00:48:35,465
So we've actually got like a constitution

1060
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:37,947
for our retro server that says we don't make any change

1061
00:48:38,267 --> 00:48:40,228
unless the majority of players have voted for it.

1062
00:48:40,488 --> 00:48:41,389
Even the smallest thing.

1063
00:48:41,409 --> 00:48:43,550
Obviously like bugs and exploits discounted,

1064
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:47,693
but that means that it only moves at the rate

1065
00:48:47,933 --> 00:48:49,614
of the majority of the players.

1066
00:48:49,894 --> 00:48:51,595
And it means it's a very conservative.

1067
00:48:52,605 --> 00:48:55,431
old style thing, but that's like exactly why it exists.

1068
00:48:56,453 --> 00:48:58,498
But yeah, we treat it as a legit service that,

1069
00:48:58,738 --> 00:49:00,983
you know, we expect it to run for decades more.

1070
00:49:01,404 --> 00:49:01,565
Thanks.

1071
00:49:04,803 --> 00:49:08,407
Hi, on a freemium model, a business model,

1072
00:49:08,627 --> 00:49:11,469
it seems hard to define lapse.

1073
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:15,733
What point do you determine a player being lapsed?

1074
00:49:15,853 --> 00:49:18,236
And what worked the best for you?

1075
00:49:18,936 --> 00:49:21,799
Which moment did you get the feedback from them?

1076
00:49:24,041 --> 00:49:25,782
So, at the beginning of the presentation,

1077
00:49:25,822 --> 00:49:28,304
I talked about how we define LAPS players

1078
00:49:28,584 --> 00:49:30,826
as people who've been away for over three months.

1079
00:49:30,846 --> 00:49:32,047
They've been out of subscription,

1080
00:49:32,327 --> 00:49:34,288
but most people, it would be a month of inactivity.

1081
00:49:34,308 --> 00:49:38,652
In terms of reaching out to them in, like, surveys and stuff,

1082
00:49:39,452 --> 00:49:40,613
we also collected all of the...

1083
00:49:40,813 --> 00:49:43,435
People have to sign up to our game with an account.

1084
00:49:43,876 --> 00:49:45,417
They can use social media accounts as well,

1085
00:49:45,477 --> 00:49:47,678
so we always have a point of contact for everyone.

1086
00:49:47,899 --> 00:49:49,960
We make sure we validate their e-mail address

1087
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,482
for customer services and payment and stuff like that.

1088
00:49:53,463 --> 00:49:55,365
So when we do surveys to lapse players,

1089
00:49:55,405 --> 00:49:57,507
we are looking at people generally who've been away,

1090
00:49:57,767 --> 00:49:58,848
I mean at least three months,

1091
00:49:58,888 --> 00:50:01,871
but probably deeper than that into six months,

1092
00:50:01,911 --> 00:50:03,612
because they're more likely to remember

1093
00:50:03,933 --> 00:50:05,194
just those important things,

1094
00:50:05,274 --> 00:50:07,756
rather than sort of a cacophony of other comments.

1095
00:50:09,318 --> 00:50:09,538
Okay?

1096
00:50:10,899 --> 00:50:12,581
Great, okay, I think we're done.

1097
00:50:12,601 --> 00:50:13,381
Thank you so much, everyone.
