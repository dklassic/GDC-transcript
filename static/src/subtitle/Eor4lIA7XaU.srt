00:00:00,429 --> 00:00:07,194
Good morning, everyone. Good evening to our guests. Good afternoon. If you're on the East Coast, good somewhere?

2
00:00:07,294 --> 00:00:11,938
I don't know, wherever you are in the world.

3
00:00:11,998 --> 00:00:15,161
Welcome, welcome to the Game Developers

4
00:00:15,241 --> 00:00:16,422
Conference

5
00:00:16,482 --> 00:00:16,962
Twitch channel.

6
00:00:18,003 --> 00:00:20,625
We are here. My name is Brian Francis. I'm usually much better at this.

7
00:00:21,126 --> 00:00:25,750
I'm gonna wander around this room for a second while I introduce us, then I'll start playing. My name is Brian Francis.

8
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,512
I'm a contributing editor at Gamasutra. I'm the community manager for GDC.

9
00:00:29,201 --> 00:00:31,261
and I am here today streaming Control.

10
00:00:31,661 --> 00:00:35,502
Control did not come out this month, to the best of my knowledge, it came out last year.

11
00:00:35,822 --> 00:00:40,343
But we are here playing Control today, for one very important reason,

12
00:00:40,363 --> 00:00:42,884
which is this game, The Fine Folks at Remedy Entertainment,

13
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:46,605
have been nominated for several Game Developers' Choice Awards.

14
00:00:46,985 --> 00:00:52,386
Those awards specifically are for best audio, best narrative, best technology...

15
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:55,586
Best in Visual Art and Game of the Year.

16
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:58,507
It's also picked up several honorable mentions.

17
00:00:59,207 --> 00:01:03,448
I'll go ahead and drop the link to the full nominations in Twitch chat.

18
00:01:05,128 --> 00:01:10,249
And in the lower left-hand corner to commemorate this nomination

19
00:01:10,949 --> 00:01:13,029
are two developers from Remedy.

20
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,070
On the left we have Brooke Maggs, and on the right we have...

21
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,390
Oh god, oh no, this is it. I'm gonna miss the last name.

22
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,691
Mikhail Kestrinen. Mikhail, did I get that right?

23
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:34,217
I'm going to go ahead and actually adjust my audio over here so that I'm not the shooting's

24
00:01:34,237 --> 00:01:34,658
not too loud.

25
00:01:34,698 --> 00:01:35,558
The shooting is really good.

26
00:01:35,598 --> 00:01:37,040
It really is best in audio.

27
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:38,721
Hi everyone.

28
00:01:38,741 --> 00:01:44,046
I can see in chat that we've got Maniac536 and we've got Remedy Games hanging out.

29
00:01:44,827 --> 00:01:45,288
Hi Remedy.

30
00:01:47,048 --> 00:01:47,869
You're already here.

31
00:01:47,889 --> 00:01:52,511
Yeah, we are here, like I said. We're commemorating the stream.

32
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:55,912
Also, we're taking the opportunity to catch up with Brook and Mikhail.

33
00:01:56,432 --> 00:01:58,373
We didn't get to do this last year when the game came out.

34
00:01:59,073 --> 00:02:01,054
We're going to talk about the making of Control.

35
00:02:01,394 --> 00:02:05,656
There's already been a lot of great interviews and features about Control.

36
00:02:05,836 --> 00:02:09,077
I totally suggest you Google around and check them out, but what we're doing today here

37
00:02:09,217 --> 00:02:14,479
is we're taking some of my questions about the making of Control, and we are also taking

38
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,061
your questions about the making of Control.

39
00:02:18,761 --> 00:02:23,503
So if you have anything in particular you want to know more about, go ahead and drop

40
00:02:23,523 --> 00:02:25,284
your questions in Twitch chat and I will ask them.

41
00:02:26,024 --> 00:02:30,186
For my part, however, I should start by letting Brooke and Mikhail introduce themselves.

42
00:02:31,095 --> 00:02:33,477
Mikael, would you mind going first for me?

43
00:02:34,478 --> 00:02:40,462
Right, yes. So my name is Mikael Kassorinen, and I'm the game director on Control.

44
00:02:41,343 --> 00:02:46,246
And I've been at Remedy for, well, almost 20 years now.

45
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:52,531
I did a little tour in Sweden and went to other cities, but the majority of my career has been at Remedy.

46
00:02:52,651 --> 00:02:59,236
I worked on Max Payne 2, Dawn of Wake, Quantum Break, and now Control is the latest one.

47
00:03:00,512 --> 00:03:04,054
Right on. And Brooke, would you introduce yourself for me, please?

48
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:08,757
Yes, hello. My name is Brooke. I'm a narrative designer on Control,

49
00:03:09,037 --> 00:03:13,379
and I moved here from Australia to work on this game, basically.

50
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:19,883
And it was my first AAA title. My background is in indie games and indie development,

51
00:03:19,903 --> 00:03:23,365
and I was a freelancer as well before that.

52
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:27,448
So, yes, making this game has been an absolute pleasure.

53
00:03:28,472 --> 00:03:32,334
Right on. As I work on some waste disposal here, I will acknowledge me...

54
00:03:32,354 --> 00:03:35,315
You're doing a good job. You're cleaning up very well.

55
00:03:35,335 --> 00:03:36,976
Ahti's gonna be very impressed.

56
00:03:37,237 --> 00:03:41,859
Ahti? He asked me to take care of this, so I take care of it.

57
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:42,279
Yeah.

58
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:46,082
I worked on this side mission, actually, with the team.

59
00:03:46,982 --> 00:03:53,146
It was a lot of fun, because we were thinking of things to do for Ahti as a cool side mission.

60
00:03:53,206 --> 00:03:54,967
And we thought about...

61
00:03:55,303 --> 00:03:58,768
Wouldn't it be funny if the director of the bureau had to, like, take out the trash?

62
00:03:59,223 --> 00:04:03,005
I'm glad you're having a good time.

63
00:04:03,585 --> 00:04:07,987
I think the director of any bureau should have to take the trash.

64
00:04:08,007 --> 00:04:09,888
Humble oneself a little bit.

65
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,409
The identity of it was the key.

66
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:20,492
And then he has the task for you that maybe seems a bit more than just taking up the trash.

67
00:04:20,672 --> 00:04:23,694
Getting rid of the rodents and so on.

68
00:04:23,894 --> 00:04:24,774
The rodents.

69
00:04:26,575 --> 00:04:29,476
We're actually going to be working on the plug in just a second.

70
00:04:30,057 --> 00:04:33,498
For folks in check, Maniac has asked us to talk about some spoiler workings for Clickable.

71
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:35,680
I will let folks know we're only going to be here for an hour.

72
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,362
So, we're looking at, you know, basically the second hour of the game, second, third hour.

73
00:04:41,182 --> 00:04:45,885
Spoiler-wise, I don't think we're hitting anything that I would consider a spoiler because I've finished the game.

74
00:04:47,326 --> 00:04:48,466
And I know what's coming up.

75
00:04:48,606 --> 00:04:52,668
But if you're sensitive about that, feel free to drop the visual, listen to audio, whatever you need.

76
00:04:53,219 --> 00:05:00,742
Um, give a quick shoutout to Brian Otto, um, and Hannah1, who also are dropping by in chat.

77
00:05:00,782 --> 00:05:03,123
Like I said, we're taking your guys' questions, feel free to drop them for us.

78
00:05:03,923 --> 00:05:04,744
Um, and yeah.

79
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:07,985
Oh man, I think I had this problem when I first played it too, which is I don't know

80
00:05:08,005 --> 00:05:08,945
where the last barrel is.

81
00:05:08,985 --> 00:05:10,146
Don't tell me, I'll find it.

82
00:05:10,326 --> 00:05:10,706
There it is.

83
00:05:10,726 --> 00:05:10,946
Okay.

84
00:05:11,126 --> 00:05:11,266
Um.

85
00:05:12,147 --> 00:05:15,352
Uh, anyway, uh, what I need to do is I need to move on to the actual questions.

86
00:05:15,912 --> 00:05:20,619
Uh, uh, Mikhail, uh, as game director of Control, uh, I would love to start by

87
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,424
picking your brain about Control's origins, um, and if you wouldn't mind

88
00:05:24,485 --> 00:05:27,028
explaining how this game got started. And I'm gonna be blunt, like...

89
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:33,281
Control is a really unique game. It's got a really unique narrative, tone, vibe.

90
00:05:33,301 --> 00:05:41,444
But it also has to balance some kind of, not totally conventional, but familiar action tropes.

91
00:05:41,564 --> 00:05:47,167
So, would you mind explaining the origins of the game and when you started balancing this combination of

92
00:05:47,387 --> 00:05:51,209
very out there concepts with conventional gameplay?

93
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:56,271
Yeah, it's a bit like... it has many...

94
00:05:57,354 --> 00:06:03,197
aspects affecting that kind of the root of why we created a game like this.

95
00:06:04,258 --> 00:06:09,041
We were coming off from a project where we wanted to have a kind of a

96
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:15,026
like a more accepting and normal world, a bit more casual experience and so on.

97
00:06:15,347 --> 00:06:21,012
And we did Unwake before Quantum Break and we're kind of overall feeling like

98
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:29,141
the next game we want to do is going to be a bit more like brave and take more risks

99
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:32,304
and not be afraid of being a bit strange.

100
00:06:33,303 --> 00:06:37,648
And that mentality existed already quite early on,

101
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,551
before we even had any idea of what we wanted to do next.

102
00:06:40,871 --> 00:06:45,897
So there was this certain kind of atmosphere that existed already that fed into this.

103
00:06:46,791 --> 00:07:00,997
And what was important to me personally was that we started to create a game where we focus more on the world than on the kind of, let's say, narrative-focused elements that we usually do.

104
00:07:01,037 --> 00:07:05,679
So it's less about the singular character, more about what is this place, what is this kind of...

105
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:07,912
basic nature.

106
00:07:08,532 --> 00:07:12,576
And me and Sam, Sam Lake, so we started the concept,

107
00:07:13,376 --> 00:07:14,537
all of these different elements,

108
00:07:14,577 --> 00:07:16,679
and that was the first decision kind of like,

109
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:19,862
let's not even worry that much about the plot,

110
00:07:19,882 --> 00:07:21,784
let's not worry about the main character yet,

111
00:07:21,844 --> 00:07:24,046
let's just talk about what is this world,

112
00:07:24,106 --> 00:07:26,788
what is this place, what are the experiences that we want to have.

113
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:32,352
And from that, we came up with the Bureau,

114
00:07:33,393 --> 00:07:38,837
the His, and the oldest house as a location, and so on.

115
00:07:38,977 --> 00:07:41,378
And the background for all of that was that we wanted it to be

116
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,861
an experience that is unexpected, full of surprises,

117
00:07:45,961 --> 00:07:50,724
and we embrace the strange side of the supernatural elements, and so on.

118
00:07:50,824 --> 00:07:53,766
And we're not afraid of going all out.

119
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,488
And what we don't want to have is that we...

120
00:07:56,989 --> 00:08:04,657
We kind of explain everything that's happening and actually quite the opposite, like we want to show things and leave the interpretation for the player.

121
00:08:05,517 --> 00:08:07,840
And of course you need to, as a designer, you need to...

122
00:08:08,736 --> 00:08:14,159
provide like elements that people can see and start to draw conclusions and so on.

123
00:08:14,179 --> 00:08:20,084
So there was this kind of acceptance that let's not explain, let's not spoon feed and so on.

124
00:08:20,984 --> 00:08:25,708
And once we kind of put those elements together and we started to see that okay

125
00:08:25,728 --> 00:08:30,551
here's a compelling package of elements that there's this exploration into

126
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:33,093
strange phenomena and we revolve around that.

127
00:08:33,894 --> 00:08:38,977
Brutalism was there almost right from the get-go, that it's an element that we want to have in the Oldest House.

128
00:08:39,877 --> 00:08:50,003
And the side that we're not going to explain everything, let's just as a player dive into this world and leave it upon them to kind of understand what's happening.

129
00:08:51,163 --> 00:09:01,069
And from there, we started to put the pieces together and start talking about, okay, what if, you know, you're kind of a director of this place.

130
00:09:02,064 --> 00:09:03,865
And actually that was the first idea.

131
00:09:03,965 --> 00:09:06,926
And then the second idea was that maybe you're an outsider.

132
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:11,347
Because we wanted to be bold with the strange ideas.

133
00:09:11,387 --> 00:09:18,969
But if your character is already part of the world, then you don't have this view into this world that the player has.

134
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:23,650
So we wanted the main character to be someone who is an outsider to this world.

135
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,071
But at the same time, we wanted them to belong.

136
00:09:27,997 --> 00:09:34,079
So, yeah, you become the director within the first five minutes of the story.

137
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:37,480
And a huge part of that was to give that lens into this world

138
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,341
through a character that can relate to you,

139
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:43,541
understand that they're kind of experiencing all of this at the same time as you are.

140
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:49,583
At the same time, that character is now a fundamental aspect, part of this world as well.

141
00:09:50,243 --> 00:09:55,685
And getting to grips with all of that is a huge part of that journey that you take with Chessie.

142
00:09:56,824 --> 00:10:01,474
And yeah, I mean, it took something like six months, roughly, to...

143
00:10:02,548 --> 00:10:06,489
concept all of these bits together and it was pretty much just me and Sam talking,

144
00:10:06,569 --> 00:10:09,771
have a lot of discussions and putting core ideas together.

145
00:10:10,691 --> 00:10:16,333
And then came the time to actually start, you know, creating the assets,

146
00:10:16,393 --> 00:10:20,314
creating demos and all of these elements that we needed to be able to

147
00:10:21,255 --> 00:10:23,576
communicate further different ideas and so on.

148
00:10:24,376 --> 00:10:27,377
And yeah, from there we kind of went into the standard

149
00:10:27,817 --> 00:10:31,378
game development procedure and so on and that's how it came together.

150
00:10:32,277 --> 00:10:32,617
Right on.

151
00:10:32,978 --> 00:10:38,126
Uh, before I do want to jump to Brooke and invite you to talk about your

152
00:10:38,146 --> 00:10:41,091
experience, but Mikhail, I'm going to ask one more question, which is, um,

153
00:10:41,392 --> 00:10:46,601
obviously Remedy has a technology base and it has, uh, uh, some of.

154
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:49,642
format of game development that it's more familiar with as a company.

155
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:52,583
Um, how did you and your colleagues...

156
00:10:52,743 --> 00:10:53,563
Oh, man, I have to get around.

157
00:10:54,023 --> 00:10:55,824
Um, how did you and your colleagues figure out...

158
00:10:55,844 --> 00:10:56,884
Okay, I can use this weapon.

159
00:10:57,184 --> 00:10:57,304
Um...

160
00:10:58,285 --> 00:10:58,965
Now I have to bring it back.

161
00:10:59,345 --> 00:11:02,526
Uh, how did you all come up with, like, this kind...

162
00:11:03,126 --> 00:11:06,427
A format for balancing, you know, the work you need to do, you know,

163
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:07,768
on making sure levels made sense,

164
00:11:07,828 --> 00:11:11,329
on making sure that gameplay felt like something that players could still understand

165
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:13,970
in a weird world, while chasing that, um...

166
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:14,730
Uh...

167
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:15,830
Uh...

168
00:11:16,647 --> 00:11:19,989
chasing that sort of weird sensation.

169
00:11:20,969 --> 00:11:26,211
I think that you guys were saying the word New Weird a lot when I was hearing the marketing

170
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:26,731
for this game.

171
00:11:28,152 --> 00:11:35,555
Yeah, New Weird was basically a stance that we took into this world.

172
00:11:36,215 --> 00:11:41,598
It is a literary genre, but at the same time it's not just about...

173
00:11:42,549 --> 00:11:48,916
Hey, let's have a strange world is about the kind of holistic behavior of characters within it and

174
00:11:49,997 --> 00:11:54,882
how these different concepts come together and this kind of avoidance of

175
00:11:55,543 --> 00:11:59,427
explaining too much what's happening and leave a lot to interpretation.

176
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:06,895
It was a challenge to balance out these type of elements together with the game that we

177
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:09,575
want you to be able to understand quite quickly.

178
00:12:10,756 --> 00:12:17,758
So that's why it was important that the core mechanics are seemingly simple, like telekinesis

179
00:12:17,818 --> 00:12:20,678
for instance being a core element of what Jessie can do.

180
00:12:21,058 --> 00:12:23,319
What I like about telekinesis is that...

181
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:29,184
It is visually simple. It is easy to explain.

182
00:12:29,304 --> 00:12:32,387
Like, you conceptually get it. You understand what's happening.

183
00:12:32,907 --> 00:12:36,170
And there is a sense of connection to the physical world.

184
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,931
So it's not like completely alien.

185
00:12:37,971 --> 00:12:42,035
It's not like some force that enters the world that you don't understand.

186
00:12:42,075 --> 00:12:44,437
We would have to explain and so on. There's none of that.

187
00:12:44,477 --> 00:12:48,280
You kind of get it quite quickly, what's happening and how it works.

188
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,102
And that was crucial. I wanted it to be...

189
00:12:50,863 --> 00:12:53,810
an approachable, relatable gameplay.

190
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:57,820
You can pick up the controller, start playing, and you can start having fun really quickly.

191
00:12:58,766 --> 00:13:03,448
But then there's this other layer, where is the actual world itself, and that's filled with mystery and secrets,

192
00:13:04,189 --> 00:13:08,151
and even contradictions, like sometimes you see a thing and you think it works in one way,

193
00:13:08,211 --> 00:13:13,274
but then once you kind of dive further into it, you learn that, oh, it's not that simple, and so on.

194
00:13:13,354 --> 00:13:17,416
So it was important for us to have these two layers, that there can be complexity

195
00:13:18,137 --> 00:13:22,279
and this kind of depth to the world that can sometimes almost be impenetrable,

196
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,022
but playing the game should be fun, should be easy, should be intuitive.

197
00:13:27,903 --> 00:13:32,928
And finding the right tone with the different missions, different side missions and all of that,

198
00:13:33,368 --> 00:13:38,153
that was a lot of iteration because we wanted to really follow up thinking that

199
00:13:38,413 --> 00:13:45,540
let's not explain everything, let's let the player pay attention and that they feel like they should be paying attention.

200
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,321
and kind of draw their own conclusions.

201
00:13:48,341 --> 00:13:52,582
So it was a huge balancing act of like exercising restraint sometimes,

202
00:13:52,642 --> 00:13:55,523
like, no, we don't need to tell that and tell that and tell that,

203
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,403
let's think those things out.

204
00:13:56,463 --> 00:13:59,184
And it actually became stronger when we did these kind of decisions.

205
00:14:00,104 --> 00:14:03,945
And what maybe was tough about it,

206
00:14:03,985 --> 00:14:08,847
because as game designers, we want people to be able to jump in and get it.

207
00:14:09,272 --> 00:14:15,859
quickly. So sometimes it's required like a specific attitude of like looking at the thing

208
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:21,084
and asking questions. I'll be telling too much. And that was I think a huge part of the process

209
00:14:21,144 --> 00:14:27,670
and a lot of time went into that kind of iteration. Right on. I got a million more questions about

210
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:32,615
this kind of topic. But Brooke, I'm gonna throw the question ball to you for a minute.

211
00:14:33,151 --> 00:14:38,834
Um, Brooke, uh, your role in the game as narrative designer, my understanding, uh, that you, that you

212
00:14:38,854 --> 00:14:43,676
were able to join the game later on in the project. Um, I would like to know, uh, there's, there's,

213
00:14:43,896 --> 00:14:49,059
it is a, it would be incorrect of me to say that games are, you know, plotted out at the start and

214
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:53,141
figured, you know, then, then just executed on way. What's, what is your narrative designer?

215
00:14:53,161 --> 00:14:58,024
What is your goal coming into a project like this and, and working, figuring out story,

216
00:14:58,084 --> 00:15:00,405
even though the game is already underway? Can you talk about that?

217
00:15:01,545 --> 00:15:02,386
Yeah, that was, um.

218
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:07,611
It was really interesting and it was a bit of a challenge too, I guess, because it was

219
00:15:07,671 --> 00:15:08,792
a brand new IP.

220
00:15:09,853 --> 00:15:16,217
My first task really was to sink myself into the world and to understand all the concepts

221
00:15:16,257 --> 00:15:23,041
that had been set up that we were just talking about and understand the ins and outs of them.

222
00:15:23,802 --> 00:15:26,443
What are objects of power and what does the Bureau do?

223
00:15:27,097 --> 00:15:29,217
You know, who is Jessie and why is she here?

224
00:15:29,277 --> 00:15:33,919
And like, not only, and know the story and know the characters and know the world,

225
00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:37,020
you know, that's been so lovingly built.

226
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:41,042
And then also understand what the tone is.

227
00:15:41,722 --> 00:15:43,442
I think that's pretty key actually.

228
00:15:43,783 --> 00:15:50,765
The mood, Control is a moody game and like it has a certain mood and tone to it that

229
00:15:50,845 --> 00:15:54,707
comes from the new weird genre, which is not over explaining things.

230
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:59,501
which is elements of science fiction and fantasy, but never, you know,

231
00:16:00,522 --> 00:16:03,064
straying into either genre, like completely.

232
00:16:03,144 --> 00:16:06,006
So coming onto the project, I remember,

233
00:16:06,026 --> 00:16:10,930
I actually remember having conversations with Sam about trying to understand

234
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:16,254
certain parts, especially when then I'd sort of understood what was going on.

235
00:16:16,294 --> 00:16:17,335
And then I was, you know,

236
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:22,098
given some areas of the game to sort of cut my teeth on, I suppose.

237
00:16:22,158 --> 00:16:24,420
And one of them was the motel sequences.

238
00:16:25,145 --> 00:16:32,030
And I even, I went, I think I went to Sam and I went to you and I went to Stuart, our

239
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:38,414
world design director, who all these people collectively sort of came up with these ideas

240
00:16:38,454 --> 00:16:42,797
and there was this legacy of ideas of what this was supposed to be and then what the

241
00:16:42,957 --> 00:16:43,838
tone should be.

242
00:16:44,558 --> 00:16:50,943
And then keeping that mood throughout development is a balancing act, as you say, because sometimes

243
00:16:50,963 --> 00:16:52,544
you just have to play it and review it.

244
00:16:54,278 --> 00:17:00,560
say well I think that's actually over-explaining the strangeness, you know, maybe we need to

245
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:06,202
dial that back or now we've gone too obtuse and people don't get it so we need to, you

246
00:17:06,222 --> 00:17:07,842
know, spell things out a little bit more.

247
00:17:08,643 --> 00:17:13,244
So for me it was, you know, an exercise in wrapping my head probably around the largest

248
00:17:13,304 --> 00:17:21,127
narrative world for a game that I had taken on yet and then I guess embodying that information.

249
00:17:21,748 --> 00:17:26,090
And I actually spent a lot of time, because we were in the heat of production,

250
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:31,892
as part of something I did when I first started, is I went to every room and introduced myself,

251
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:35,794
and said, what do you all do in this room, and how can narrative help you?

252
00:17:35,814 --> 00:17:41,736
And I actually incidentally picked up these questions that people had about the world,

253
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:47,678
that were, you know, pretty nuanced kind of questions, you know,

254
00:17:47,698 --> 00:17:50,799
so I didn't always know the answers, so I would collect them up.

255
00:17:51,364 --> 00:17:56,005
go back to the narrative room, we would sort of talk about the answers and what that should

256
00:17:56,045 --> 00:17:58,326
be and then I would sort of take them back to the team.

257
00:17:58,606 --> 00:18:04,608
Because the team don't necessarily have the time to delve into every sort of nook and

258
00:18:04,688 --> 00:18:12,370
cranny of the world that we in the narrative department have our great law documents going

259
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:12,590
on.

260
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,951
But sometimes they just need an answer quite quickly.

261
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,423
Being able to convey that narrative mood and that information to them quickly and succinctly

262
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:25,866
was a lot of what I was doing.

263
00:18:25,886 --> 00:18:28,968
And then also after that I took on the side missions.

264
00:18:29,628 --> 00:18:35,772
And so part of my job was to understand the intent behind them, to understand, you know,

265
00:18:35,812 --> 00:18:40,715
what this one is meant to say, flesh out a character or it's meant to introduce an aspect

266
00:18:40,755 --> 00:18:41,235
of the world.

267
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:46,762
And then I would go through, because a lot of it was in partial production,

268
00:18:46,822 --> 00:18:48,723
so I would go through and see what was there,

269
00:18:49,223 --> 00:18:53,325
and meet people who were working on it, and find out what their design intent was,

270
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:59,188
and sort of liaise between departments for the side missions and for the motels.

271
00:19:00,408 --> 00:19:05,210
And we definitely honed them a lot, I would say, in that time.

272
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:07,891
So, yeah, that's...

273
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:16,601
I just want to say how amazing important that work was, because you were the glue between

274
00:19:16,681 --> 00:19:19,945
different departments of audio levels and so on.

275
00:19:22,943 --> 00:19:27,765
Finding also I think opportunity as well, like you know we were maybe even thinking of highlighting

276
00:19:27,785 --> 00:19:32,126
certain things in certain quests and then you kind of saw this like hey what if you connect

277
00:19:32,146 --> 00:19:36,847
this and we bring that up there and so on and that was that was wonderful and I think hugely

278
00:19:36,887 --> 00:19:42,769
important to create this kind of a cohesive world that feels like connected and so on so yeah.

279
00:19:42,929 --> 00:19:47,310
Thank you very much that's lovely to hear. Obviously did a good job.

280
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:54,209
I'm trying to do a good job as Director of the Oldest House right now, but

281
00:19:54,889 --> 00:19:57,313
Director of the Bureau of Control, I should say, not the Oldest House.

282
00:19:57,573 --> 00:20:01,539
But I'm going to pause the game so I can get questions in the chat because this is getting really hard.

283
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,082
I'm going to grab a question from the chat.

284
00:20:04,382 --> 00:20:08,726
Brian Otto, who I believe is a speedrunner, Brian Otto would like to know,

285
00:20:09,026 --> 00:20:13,449
has the speedrun for Control changed the way you all approach development at all?

286
00:20:13,769 --> 00:20:17,512
I will stack on that question, which is speedrunning has been a thing for a few years.

287
00:20:17,612 --> 00:20:22,936
I'm curious if speedrunning at all and its existence informed how you think about game development.

288
00:20:22,996 --> 00:20:23,336
Mikhail?

289
00:20:24,737 --> 00:20:27,459
Um, well...

290
00:20:29,756 --> 00:20:34,640
First of all, I just want to say again how amazing that screen run was.

291
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,961
I really enjoyed it.

292
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:37,061
It's pretty incredible.

293
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,083
So it was a lot of fun.

294
00:20:40,224 --> 00:20:48,290
I don't think it, at least to me, it doesn't really affect the way we work on the game.

295
00:20:49,111 --> 00:20:53,474
I think it's a great thing to kind of observe and see,

296
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:55,796
and you see the game through different eyes,

297
00:20:55,836 --> 00:20:58,218
so it's always great to have that perspective.

298
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:05,561
But I think fundamentally I'm not personally looking at the game from that angle.

299
00:21:06,381 --> 00:21:11,683
And it's kind of hard to even imagine how that would work, because a huge part of speedrunning is

300
00:21:12,544 --> 00:21:18,466
have this kind of attitude of, let's see how much we can essentially break the game.

301
00:21:19,106 --> 00:21:20,086
That's the whole idea.

302
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:26,092
And it's weirdly enjoyable to see that happening,

303
00:21:26,172 --> 00:21:30,217
even though it kind of makes your heart sink a bit, like,

304
00:21:30,337 --> 00:21:35,062
oh no, that happened, and oh no, I didn't even know that was possible.

305
00:21:35,322 --> 00:21:37,244
But it's also fun at the same time.

306
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:42,609
And what makes me personally excited about games is the improvisation.

307
00:21:43,711 --> 00:21:46,694
when people do things that you don't expect with your game.

308
00:21:47,555 --> 00:21:51,399
And actually now that I think about it, a huge part of Control's

309
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,662
vision for combat was that...

310
00:21:55,364 --> 00:22:02,546
It is this physical space that we're giving to the player with a lot of low-level systems

311
00:22:02,566 --> 00:22:05,788
that work in a predictable physical way.

312
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:10,510
So there's no like clean, clear rules that it always goes like this.

313
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:14,411
There's this sense of looseness to, like you can pick up any physical object you want.

314
00:22:14,471 --> 00:22:20,273
We were not going to just like, we try to make everything functional and physical and

315
00:22:20,313 --> 00:22:21,794
behave in the way that you expect.

316
00:22:22,654 --> 00:22:28,976
And with understanding that the risk is that we might not have perfected every single bit.

317
00:22:29,276 --> 00:22:34,117
We haven't probably checked every single possibility of what the players might do.

318
00:22:34,917 --> 00:22:37,097
And in a way, that was the intent.

319
00:22:37,197 --> 00:22:40,158
I wanted people to improvise, have fun,

320
00:22:40,918 --> 00:22:48,460
and being able to see where people come up with ideas that you didn't think of is fantastic.

321
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,940
I love that, and especially speedrunners.

322
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,662
That's the essence of what they're doing.

323
00:22:54,263 --> 00:23:01,430
So yeah, in a way we think about it, but I don't think it affects the game development per se, at least from my end.

324
00:23:02,011 --> 00:23:02,552
That makes sense.

325
00:23:02,772 --> 00:23:07,877
I'm very happy with a piece I did on Gamas for a while back,

326
00:23:08,718 --> 00:23:11,781
interviewing some developers who work with speedrunners to get their game done.

327
00:23:12,168 --> 00:23:14,270
But obviously, that's the exception. Not a rule.

328
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:19,473
Um, now, uh, while I beat these heads up, I'm going to repause to jump-

329
00:23:19,653 --> 00:23:22,435
Oh, actually, yeah, there's a good question in chat from Ruchess.

330
00:23:23,295 --> 00:23:26,637
Uh, who would like to know, did the layout of this game begin as more of an action game

331
00:23:26,717 --> 00:23:32,461
with set-piece elements like Half-Life, or as a hero shooter combining powers like Prototype or Singularity?

332
00:23:36,057 --> 00:23:39,318
Sorry, what was the actual question?

333
00:23:39,358 --> 00:23:42,140
The question is how did this game sort of begin to come together?

334
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:51,243
Was it more set-piece driven, like okay, or was it more like we're going to develop these powers and then sort of develop set-pieces around them?

335
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:58,667
You mentioned in your answer just a second ago that this is a, you know, you have low-level powers with rules that work everywhere.

336
00:23:58,687 --> 00:23:58,787
Right.

337
00:24:01,659 --> 00:24:07,563
I say yeah, it wasn't about set pieces, it was about the world itself and then finding

338
00:24:07,623 --> 00:24:12,187
compelling elements that you can discover yourself within this world and less about

339
00:24:12,668 --> 00:24:18,772
constructing certain type of moments for the player and instead like, you know.

340
00:24:19,693 --> 00:24:25,776
Let the player be the ones that figure out how to go through it, what to do and so on,

341
00:24:25,936 --> 00:24:29,958
and kind of stay out from their way, I think, as much as possible.

342
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:37,922
Sure enough, when you look at set pieces in the kind of sense as, let's say, boss fights

343
00:24:38,402 --> 00:24:42,404
or the objects of power that you discover,

344
00:24:43,084 --> 00:25:04,710
In a way, yes, that kind of thinking existed early on, but the whole idea was that it's like, you know, the boss fights in Dark Souls, that they kind of exist there, you can discover them and so on, but they are not necessarily, like, a bigger set piece moments, like, connected to the story and so on, and more to the world and gameplay instead.

345
00:25:05,951 --> 00:25:08,632
I think it's probably true, too, that...

346
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:15,783
We knew that we were going to make a game with gunplay and abilities, but we also knew

347
00:25:15,843 --> 00:25:23,789
that the world would, well, it's all set inside one location, but it's a very interesting

348
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:28,093
kind of winding, shifting, strange location that you can explore.

349
00:25:28,533 --> 00:25:33,296
And I know a lot of the world development that Stuart and the team did.

350
00:25:33,942 --> 00:25:38,523
to build out the oldest house, thinking of it as a government bureau and going, okay,

351
00:25:38,563 --> 00:25:43,965
well, if they're studying, you know, the supernatural and unexplained, what kind of departments

352
00:25:44,025 --> 00:25:49,626
would they possibly have? And then, you know, then we had the research sector and then what

353
00:25:49,646 --> 00:25:55,288
would go inside the research sector? And then it's also about the combination of making

354
00:25:55,328 --> 00:25:58,569
that space large enough to be enjoyable with those abilities.

355
00:25:59,707 --> 00:26:06,531
But also, for example, I know one of the reasons that Stuart and Yan-Nei sort of went with

356
00:26:06,591 --> 00:26:14,136
Brutalism is because it's very straight, clean lines that actually works really well when

357
00:26:14,256 --> 00:26:18,219
the players are running around, you know, kind of destroying things with their abilities.

358
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:21,341
Like, the environment is more readable in that way.

359
00:26:21,361 --> 00:26:23,682
If the environment was super busy all the time.

360
00:26:24,303 --> 00:26:29,224
it would be really hard. So it's all been really considered in terms of how it's designed.

361
00:26:29,284 --> 00:26:35,706
For example, in the maintenance sector, you have the huge power reactor, which is sort

362
00:26:35,746 --> 00:26:43,129
of a set piece in and of itself, I guess. So each area has its own character. I know

363
00:26:43,209 --> 00:26:48,710
that style guides were put together for the colour palette of each sector, what the lines

364
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:49,851
on the floor will say.

365
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:55,520
what kind of signage the maintenance sector uses compared to the research sector, because

366
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:58,821
there would be different people there, they would need to know different things.

367
00:26:59,562 --> 00:27:10,146
So yeah, and then how the oldest house opens up over time ties into the gameplay pretty

368
00:27:10,226 --> 00:27:11,206
closely as well.

369
00:27:11,366 --> 00:27:16,469
So you always have reason to come back through different sectors as well, so that influenced

370
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,950
the way that the game was created.

371
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:23,310
Um, I'm gonna ask a follow-up question kind of about the space of the game.

372
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:27,714
Uh, one of the cool things about the oldest house is that it sort of lets the player in on the script.

373
00:27:27,754 --> 00:27:30,216
That level design game's a giant, you know, it doesn't...

374
00:27:30,236 --> 00:27:32,118
Hallways aren't hallways, uh...

375
00:27:33,297 --> 00:27:35,679
Area elevators aren't actually elevators, you know, like...

376
00:27:35,899 --> 00:27:36,439
Yeah.

377
00:27:36,499 --> 00:27:41,202
When levels in games are made, they do not follow real-world logic.

378
00:27:41,362 --> 00:27:44,424
By knowing what the player sees and what's going on behind the scenes.

379
00:27:44,464 --> 00:27:47,886
What was it like, like, sort of making a space for both of you?

380
00:27:47,906 --> 00:27:49,728
I'd love to hear both your thoughts on this, that...

381
00:27:50,728 --> 00:27:50,848
Uh...

382
00:27:51,008 --> 00:27:52,409
Sometimes it's just...

383
00:27:52,429 --> 00:27:52,809
This can...

384
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:57,092
Like, the opening area of the game when A.T. first unlocks the elevator for you is a perfect example.

385
00:27:57,132 --> 00:27:59,153
Like, it doesn't make sense, and yet it's working.

386
00:28:01,685 --> 00:28:08,327
Well, a huge part of the style or feel that we wanted to have, that there's this conflict

387
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:10,868
or collision of strange and mundane.

388
00:28:11,868 --> 00:28:17,169
And we wanted to avoid, like, let's just have strange stuff and then acting strange.

389
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:20,990
What made it interesting is that it's familiar, something that you can recognize and understand,

390
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:21,710
like an elevator.

391
00:28:22,302 --> 00:28:29,584
But then as you use it, you discover that something else, something more complicated is going on that you're having a hard time understanding.

392
00:28:30,124 --> 00:28:45,668
So, you can see that through the entire game that most of the stuff is taking something that you can really understand and then turning it into something surprising and so on.

393
00:28:45,688 --> 00:28:48,148
That's the feel of Unexpected.

394
00:28:48,168 --> 00:28:48,909
Hmm.

395
00:28:49,609 --> 00:28:50,829
And I know a lot of the...

396
00:28:51,462 --> 00:28:55,364
level designers kind of really got creative with that as well.

397
00:28:56,365 --> 00:29:00,827
You know, in the research sector, for example, there are quite a few environment secrets

398
00:29:00,887 --> 00:29:05,750
and I remember working with Anna Marie and she was telling me all of these things that

399
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:10,912
was possible for players to do if they used the launch ability to stack things up and

400
00:29:10,932 --> 00:29:14,414
they could be able to get into a certain area or something like that.

401
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,783
She was really thinking through how players would play the space, but then also what creative

402
00:29:20,823 --> 00:29:25,305
things you could do given the strange nature of the oldest house.

403
00:29:25,325 --> 00:29:32,668
So I think it sort of freed up level design a little bit in a way to do that.

404
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:38,931
But then also from a story perspective, so the motels are, basically the motel sequences

405
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:44,254
are a way for players to get from one area of the oldest house to another to open up

406
00:29:45,186 --> 00:29:52,072
areas and spaces and this whole idea of having this transient space that you access with

407
00:29:52,112 --> 00:29:58,477
a light switch cord, you go to a motel in a completely different area outside the oldest

408
00:29:58,517 --> 00:30:04,181
house and solve some puzzles to then get the key to get back to a different part.

409
00:30:04,982 --> 00:30:08,985
I don't think that would have been, you know, that's not, that's something that our world

410
00:30:09,045 --> 00:30:13,169
allows for, which is, allows us to be more creative I would say.

411
00:30:15,274 --> 00:30:16,115
So, yeah.

412
00:30:16,835 --> 00:30:19,896
Um, Brooke, I think also while I'm here, I should mention that you're giving a talk at

413
00:30:19,916 --> 00:30:20,357
GDC.

414
00:30:21,037 --> 00:30:21,137
Uh...

415
00:30:21,557 --> 00:30:22,017
I am, yes!

416
00:30:22,057 --> 00:30:24,879
Which is a talk about the making of the Ocean View Motel.

417
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:32,022
So if you're going to GDC, or if you just like keeping an eye on our, uh, um, GDC Vault

418
00:30:32,042 --> 00:30:34,103
and GDC YouTube channel, keep an eye out for that talk.

419
00:30:34,844 --> 00:30:35,884
It is probably going to be good.

420
00:30:36,609 --> 00:30:44,432
Um, while I am beating up the enemies, uh, I'm going to give, uh, this is going to be a tough question to sort out, but I'd like to give, uh,

421
00:30:44,872 --> 00:30:52,214
Hackegel and Billy the Kit- er, uh, Maniac536 just a brief nod because they've been really good viewers today.

422
00:30:52,694 --> 00:31:02,678
Um, they're asking about the possibility of either an artbook and also finding out what is behind the redacted sections of some of the art of the- of the, um, collectibles, which I have been skipping over.

423
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:08,239
Find that! They're redacted! The point of it is that you can't find out.

424
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:12,380
That being said, Brooke, I will let you as the narrative designer...

425
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,241
I'll take that one.

426
00:31:14,401 --> 00:31:18,242
How do you feel about those redacted stuff and letting players find the information?

427
00:31:19,262 --> 00:31:27,084
Well, I mean, we had a lot of fun writing them, but I would say that that is top secret information

428
00:31:27,104 --> 00:31:30,185
that's probably been lost forever. Unfortunately.

429
00:31:31,532 --> 00:31:32,994
It's been redacted for a reason.

430
00:31:33,014 --> 00:31:40,622
It's been redacted for a reason. It's very top secret, important stuff that cannot be revealed.

431
00:31:40,822 --> 00:31:42,664
Lower explanations on the game dev chat.

432
00:31:42,804 --> 00:31:43,845
Okay, I need to move on.

433
00:31:45,247 --> 00:31:49,371
For information about an art book, I would invite the folks from MIDI Games to...

434
00:31:50,405 --> 00:31:51,605
Sorry, turtle that on you.

435
00:31:52,866 --> 00:31:55,668
If you want to reply to that one, I need to leave that to you.

436
00:31:55,688 --> 00:32:01,290
Anyway, Mikal, we only have so much time with you left, so I do want to squeeze in some more questions.

437
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:11,642
What, with a team like the one you have, uh, like you know this really talented team of creative people,

438
00:32:12,142 --> 00:32:15,703
um, working as hard as they can to put out an interest, you know, to execute the vision that

439
00:32:15,723 --> 00:32:20,785
you and Sam, uh, and your board director whose name I'm blanking on, came up with, um, what do

440
00:32:20,825 --> 00:32:24,867
you feel, I like asking directors this question, what do you feel is essential to communicating

441
00:32:25,947 --> 00:32:32,450
The reason behind your yeses and noes for people, because obviously you sort of have the authority to go yes, no, yes, no to everything they throw at you.

442
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:42,655
But what's the difference between just arbitrarily toss handing down yeses and noes on what they make versus explaining and shepherding, you know, and making an even better product, I guess?

443
00:32:43,855 --> 00:32:52,299
That's totally right. You just drop the hammer and go, no.

444
00:32:52,379 --> 00:32:53,280
Actually, he doesn't.

445
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:03,367
Well sometimes you need to start with that, but you're responsible for making people understand

446
00:33:03,407 --> 00:33:08,391
the reasoning behind it, and you want to take the extra time to make sure that everybody's

447
00:33:08,491 --> 00:33:09,912
comfortable with that decision.

448
00:33:10,953 --> 00:33:15,117
What's tricky with control is that it embraces certain kind of...

449
00:33:15,537 --> 00:33:21,082
philosophies and ideas that yes, you can say them out loud like early on in production

450
00:33:21,122 --> 00:33:25,785
and say these are the key elements that we should all look at and think about and so

451
00:33:25,805 --> 00:33:25,865
on.

452
00:33:25,905 --> 00:33:31,029
But then when it comes to actual execution, when you actually start to build things, you

453
00:33:31,069 --> 00:33:34,112
realize that there are a lot of things that are not clear cut.

454
00:33:34,132 --> 00:33:39,636
There's grey zones and a lot of things that are less for interpretation.

455
00:33:40,757 --> 00:33:47,801
And so that I think made it this tough and there was a need to quite often have these sit-downs

456
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:53,004
where we kind of like, okay, let's talk through this concept and kind of sometimes it is about

457
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:58,306
finding the answer together. And a huge part was very important to me with Control was that

458
00:34:00,107 --> 00:34:06,171
We don't work in a way where me and Sam, like we producers, green-light, just give it to people.

459
00:34:06,191 --> 00:34:10,854
Like, we're going to do this game. That's not what I want. I don't think that's what we wanted.

460
00:34:11,534 --> 00:34:15,857
A huge part of it was to establish that this is the world we want to create.

461
00:34:15,917 --> 00:34:19,619
Here are the high-level rules that we want to follow.

462
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,642
And then give the team this kind of a sandbox to play in.

463
00:34:24,683 --> 00:34:25,883
That they can start building.

464
00:34:26,824 --> 00:34:30,246
Their ideas on what kind of side missions we could have and so on.

465
00:34:30,266 --> 00:34:34,570
A lot of the ideas in Control are actually directed from the team themselves.

466
00:34:35,397 --> 00:34:42,123
And it's good for creativity. A lot of ideas I or Sam never come up with.

467
00:34:42,403 --> 00:34:44,445
And that's wonderful. That's exactly what we want.

468
00:34:44,566 --> 00:34:47,749
But then there's this importance to do a follow-up.

469
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:53,914
Like, you know, a huge part of my job is to ensure that the end result is cohesive.

470
00:34:53,974 --> 00:34:58,379
It kind of makes sense. Sometimes it might be hard to see how it makes sense,

471
00:34:58,439 --> 00:34:59,900
but you feel it and it's there.

472
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,881
even the weirder stuff that you see in the game

473
00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:05,302
feels like it belongs there.

474
00:35:05,882 --> 00:35:07,363
And that's not an accident,

475
00:35:07,403 --> 00:35:10,584
that's us carefully considering

476
00:35:10,744 --> 00:35:12,325
all these different aspects we're doing.

477
00:35:13,085 --> 00:35:18,147
And that's the basis of reasoning that I'm trying to provide.

478
00:35:19,587 --> 00:35:21,828
And sometimes there are things that are just...

479
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:24,729
I'll be honest, sometimes it's like

480
00:35:25,869 --> 00:35:28,410
you just have to kind of...

481
00:35:29,421 --> 00:35:32,622
You have to realise it. You kind of just know what's the right direction.

482
00:35:32,942 --> 00:35:37,844
And of course I spend all this time trying to explain it, but sometimes it kind of can be like,

483
00:35:38,864 --> 00:35:41,265
tonally this is the right way to go.

484
00:35:41,805 --> 00:35:47,267
And there needs to be that kind of a higher level direction sometimes that adjusts different types of things.

485
00:35:47,287 --> 00:35:49,808
So yeah, complicated, but yeah.

486
00:35:49,928 --> 00:35:51,469
But it's time well spent, isn't it?

487
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:55,670
Because when you spend the time to explain why you're making a decision,

488
00:35:56,111 --> 00:35:56,811
then it helps.

489
00:35:57,328 --> 00:36:01,432
Clarify the direction and the mood and the thing that we're going for.

490
00:36:01,992 --> 00:36:05,214
Now I remember when when I first came to Remedy

491
00:36:06,836 --> 00:36:11,199
Sam took the time to take us through the narrative presentation

492
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:16,503
Which basically sort of summed up the world for us and like introduced us to you know

493
00:36:16,623 --> 00:36:21,927
What you guys had been creating and sort of introduced us to the characters. I didn't sort of just

494
00:36:22,723 --> 00:36:26,126
Oh, I'm here, I'll just, you know, go off and read about this I guess.

495
00:36:26,146 --> 00:36:28,989
You know, they take the time and you even did a,

496
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:35,255
it was like a creative game overall overview update for us

497
00:36:35,755 --> 00:36:37,777
and presented it to us, the whole team,

498
00:36:38,718 --> 00:36:41,921
which was talking about the key pillars of the game and what you wanted to get

499
00:36:41,961 --> 00:36:45,284
across and, you know, what it was about and like

500
00:36:45,324 --> 00:36:47,867
the physicality of the powers and the...

501
00:36:49,046 --> 00:36:54,910
You know, the strangeness of the entities in the world, all of that kind of stuff helps.

502
00:36:54,970 --> 00:37:05,296
Like, I think that the leadership here spends a lot of time on that because it's such a remedy thing, I guess.

503
00:37:05,316 --> 00:37:16,944
Like, we have these very interesting, complex worlds that, you know, take some time to, like, get, I guess, get across.

504
00:37:18,155 --> 00:37:24,699
And especially because Control was a new IP and is doing different things gameplay and

505
00:37:24,759 --> 00:37:34,005
world-wise, so that I imagine required a lot more considering on how you would communicate

506
00:37:34,025 --> 00:37:35,005
that and get that across.

507
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:35,626
For sure.

508
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:39,888
That's, I think, one of the hardest parts when you're creating a new IP.

509
00:37:39,988 --> 00:37:41,849
Basically none of it exists.

510
00:37:42,897 --> 00:37:48,101
And you really have to do the legwork to justify your reasons.

511
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:49,762
You can't just come up with things.

512
00:37:49,802 --> 00:37:57,028
You have to have the fundamental thinking to be solid behind everything that you're saying.

513
00:37:57,889 --> 00:37:59,990
And yeah, that took a lot of time.

514
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:06,475
But at the same time, you want to leave wiggle room for the team to be creative and have

515
00:38:06,495 --> 00:38:10,699
that little sandbox where they can come up with a lot of new ideas as well.

516
00:38:12,622 --> 00:38:14,403
Right on, that was, I think, a really good answer.

517
00:38:14,643 --> 00:38:23,128
Um, I'm gonna give a quick shoutout to BillyTheKid3, who says they bought two copies of this game for two of their friends for Christmas and got the special edition for themselves.

518
00:38:23,208 --> 00:38:24,289
Nice, thank you!

519
00:38:24,749 --> 00:38:31,253
Um, uh, uh, so I'm gonna shoutout to, uh, Maniac536, who seemed to have a big love for the easter eggs in this game.

520
00:38:31,594 --> 00:38:38,658
My partner, who, uh, played this game with me and was a big Alan White fan, immediately made sure, uh, after, cause she played it and...

521
00:38:39,259 --> 00:38:43,502
got ahead of me and she's like, okay you need to go to the Alan Wake room and I'm like, uh, I never played Alan Wake.

522
00:38:44,143 --> 00:38:50,568
And I went, and she went, what? And she still made me go there. Um, uh, uh, I guess it's a

523
00:38:50,588 --> 00:38:54,652
spoiler though, there's an Alan Wake room. Oh man, this is one of my, research, central research, this is one of my favorites.

524
00:38:54,672 --> 00:39:00,417
Oh right, central research. I love. This is my favorite lobby, I really like this. Oh yeah, so you have this.

525
00:39:00,437 --> 00:39:02,739
I just wanted to say it's my new.

526
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,143
I also, I also love the Dr Darling videos there.

527
00:39:07,502 --> 00:39:09,404
Yeah, well man, we're getting into the Dr. Darling stuff.

528
00:39:09,484 --> 00:39:10,124
It's so good.

529
00:39:10,224 --> 00:39:10,525
Yeah.

530
00:39:10,885 --> 00:39:12,726
Um, uh, yeah.

531
00:39:13,107 --> 00:39:16,509
Uh, we only have a few minutes left with, uh, McCall.

532
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:19,512
So I'm going to, uh, Brooke, I'm gonna throw some questions your way in a moment,

533
00:39:19,532 --> 00:39:23,095
but I want to give McCall a chance to talk with our audience today.

534
00:39:23,655 --> 00:39:27,118
Um, McCall, uh, I am going to, um.

535
00:39:28,259 --> 00:39:32,382
When I started playing this game, I realized that you could secretly call it a Metroidvania.

536
00:39:34,124 --> 00:39:35,865
Because there's a sense of...

537
00:39:36,206 --> 00:39:43,332
Just like in Metroid or Castlevania, you get upgrades. Those upgrades reopen areas in old fictions for you.

538
00:39:43,512 --> 00:39:45,634
Oh no, there's too many rockets! Stop it!

539
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:51,900
Um, uh, and that means the level design for this game is a straightforward adventure, but a, you know,

540
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:58,722
uh, like you said, like you've described, it's a world that players can learn more about both

541
00:39:59,202 --> 00:40:06,164
literally, they can learn narrative things, hold still, um, and uh, they can also learn how to move

542
00:40:06,184 --> 00:40:10,245
within it, which is they when they revisit old zones and use their abilities to go new areas.

543
00:40:10,425 --> 00:40:14,927
I do not like what's happening right now. Um, give me, give me help.

544
00:40:16,127 --> 00:40:28,592
Would you mind explaining the process of creating areas that players can re-explore and backtrack through without feeling like they're wasting time?

545
00:40:37,394 --> 00:40:43,818
Huge part of the thinking that we had from the get-go that, I mean, looking back, like,

546
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:50,401
we came from Quantum Break, and it's a linear story-driven game. A lot of spaces were built

547
00:40:51,022 --> 00:40:56,204
with a purpose in mind, but you can't just run through them in 10 seconds, you never return,

548
00:40:56,264 --> 00:41:00,046
and so on. It was actually interesting, I felt like when we were working on Quantum that we

549
00:41:00,287 --> 00:41:03,648
spent actually a lot of time justifying the existence of different things you see in the

550
00:41:03,668 --> 00:41:06,930
world. There's a lot of lore, there's a lot of stories behind them, and so on.

551
00:41:07,751 --> 00:41:14,457
And to me at the time it almost felt like we spent all this time kind of building this framework,

552
00:41:14,477 --> 00:41:18,280
this construct of ideas that is expressed within the place that you go through,

553
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:22,063
but then the play just kind of blasts through them, kills everybody and moves on to the next room.

554
00:41:22,684 --> 00:41:25,446
And it was a bit of a shame, I felt.

555
00:41:26,207 --> 00:41:33,011
And when you look at control, I think you're seeing elements that we've already been doing in our previous games,

556
00:41:33,051 --> 00:41:34,391
in our more linear games.

557
00:41:34,832 --> 00:41:39,854
So I think they kind of understand and know how to create a compelling environment that already existed.

558
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:45,237
But the problem that we've had is that we've always done a linear story-driven thing,

559
00:41:45,598 --> 00:41:51,181
we're driven by the action, we're driven by the story, we need to move on to the next bit and so on.

560
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:56,642
So it was a big change, honestly, to us to kind of change that thinking that,

561
00:41:57,162 --> 00:41:59,464
no, you're here for the world, you're here to explore.

562
00:41:59,524 --> 00:42:02,827
It's like, let's give the players a chance to discover.

563
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:06,489
And when that landed, like when people...

564
00:42:07,672 --> 00:42:14,015
really took it like, yes, it's not about thinking where the next trigger is, it's not about,

565
00:42:14,435 --> 00:42:20,817
you know, where the next cinematic will happen, it is about the space itself. And through that

566
00:42:20,917 --> 00:42:24,438
thinking, great things started to happen and we get these...

567
00:42:24,978 --> 00:42:31,100
Things like the trees in the middle of this space, for instance, that kind of grounds it, that acts as a kind of an anchor point,

568
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:35,561
and it can lead you into different directions, you always return to this central area and so on.

569
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:41,942
It led to that kind of very visual thinking, it's connected to the lore of the world, it's connected to all these

570
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:45,403
different things that you discover, yes, in the story as well.

571
00:42:45,943 --> 00:42:46,123
So...

572
00:42:47,084 --> 00:42:53,527
Yeah, it kind of happened organically, but it had to happen through a process where everybody was able to

573
00:42:53,547 --> 00:43:01,732
knowingly step back and away from how we thought about things before and embrace the idea that the focus should be on the space.

574
00:43:02,412 --> 00:43:08,417
Instead of just a kind of a core narrative piece, that's kind of a linear arc that usually goes through.

575
00:43:08,737 --> 00:43:13,481
And once that happened, and once we kind of continued iterating, it kind of just came together.

576
00:43:13,521 --> 00:43:18,605
It's kind of weird when I think about it, because this is a massive change that we did in the way of thinking.

577
00:43:19,386 --> 00:43:25,290
And yeah, I think a huge part of that is that kind of a know-how and understanding that we already created in the previous games that we did.

578
00:43:26,652 --> 00:43:32,157
Right on, uh, oh man, I could tell so many questions, so many observations at you right now.

579
00:43:32,397 --> 00:43:37,201
Um, just like, I couldn't get over just in this fight for instance, how this, they all spawn this corner,

580
00:43:37,562 --> 00:43:41,866
you're fighting in this corner, the walls that you're looking at right here drive you, like, visually to look in this corner,

581
00:43:41,906 --> 00:43:44,248
so it was easy for me, this fight was quote-unquote easy,

582
00:43:44,568 --> 00:43:47,211
because I could, like, just sort of focus on everything.

583
00:43:47,651 --> 00:43:50,614
Um, there's so much about Control that I think is so cool, about celebrating,

584
00:43:50,634 --> 00:43:52,716
and that's probably why it picked up so many nominations.

585
00:43:53,416 --> 00:43:58,103
Uh, at the Game Developers Twisters, which I forgot to mention, are on March 18th, and you can watch it on- here on Twitch,

586
00:43:58,664 --> 00:44:01,608
or you can attend the show at GDC this year, if you come.

587
00:44:02,329 --> 00:44:03,510
Uh, sorry for the- for the-

588
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:04,512
reshilling.

589
00:44:05,033 --> 00:44:09,699
Um, Mikal, before you go, uh, we're gonna have some time with Brooke before I shut down the stream, uh-

590
00:44:10,841 --> 00:44:14,262
Uh, I'm going to share one observation I had and I'm curious about your thoughts about it.

591
00:44:14,342 --> 00:44:30,891
What separates Control for me from a lot of other video games is that this game kicks off with a different kind of empowering premise that ties back to what you talked about with this world that we're trying to explore and this, um, everything which is the idea that, um, you were right.

592
00:44:31,192 --> 00:44:34,353
Like, it's a theme that I feel from the minute the game starts.

593
00:44:34,653 --> 00:44:40,296
Uh, there's this sense of validation that comes with Jesse's story and, uh, the way you explore this world, which is.

594
00:44:40,713 --> 00:44:43,134
You know, as you pass through dead letters, as you read the collectibles,

595
00:44:43,154 --> 00:44:45,194
you get the sense that, you know, there was a conspiracy.

596
00:44:45,534 --> 00:44:46,775
You were hurt as a kid.

597
00:44:47,075 --> 00:44:48,075
There was a coverup.

598
00:44:48,115 --> 00:44:49,656
You were separated from your brother.

599
00:44:49,916 --> 00:44:52,276
People were acting with bad intentions around you.

600
00:44:52,296 --> 00:44:54,697
There's something really empowering in a way for that.

601
00:44:54,717 --> 00:44:56,618
It's different than other games I've played.

602
00:44:56,658 --> 00:45:00,339
A lot of games, you know, you get stronger, you, or you start, you can become strong.

603
00:45:00,379 --> 00:45:02,299
That's, that's a great kind of empowerment.

604
00:45:02,459 --> 00:45:05,900
Um, you can look at games like Devil May Cry 5, where you start strong, lose your

605
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,501
powers, and then have to regain them.

606
00:45:15,075 --> 00:45:21,897
And it's a huge part of our behavior and yeah, I think there's something really interesting and unique in that.

607
00:45:21,917 --> 00:45:26,038
I was in love with that idea. I think the moment was set out loud.

608
00:45:26,078 --> 00:45:28,738
So yeah, it's a huge part of the experience.

609
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,479
Oh man, this is a fun room, but I don't have time to do it.

610
00:45:32,939 --> 00:45:33,820
That is a fun room.

611
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:38,121
Yeah, Old God of Asgard, that it.

612
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:38,861
Yeah.

613
00:45:39,221 --> 00:45:43,222
Shout out to the Old Guards of Asgard, but you said they don't have time to witness your glory today.

614
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:51,485
With that, I call. Thank you for joining us. I understand you have to duck out. Thank you

615
00:45:51,625 --> 00:45:55,908
for your insightful answers about directing control. Congratulations on all the nominations.

616
00:45:56,228 --> 00:46:02,993
And yeah, that's about all I got for now. Brooke, we will chat with you for the rest of our time.

617
00:46:03,013 --> 00:46:04,854
Okay, excellent.

618
00:46:05,557 --> 00:46:05,997
Goodbye!

619
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:07,578
Alright, bye bye!

620
00:46:07,959 --> 00:46:09,320
Thank you, it was a lot of fun!

621
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:10,880
Yes, I'm out.

622
00:46:11,081 --> 00:46:11,921
I'll do my best.

623
00:46:12,802 --> 00:46:15,904
Oh man, uh,

624
00:46:15,944 --> 00:46:17,304
yeah, BillyTheKid wants to say

625
00:46:17,424 --> 00:46:19,165
thanks to McCall for connecting.

626
00:46:19,366 --> 00:46:19,506
Um,

627
00:46:20,566 --> 00:46:23,568
it's funny, the stream going down broke my entire

628
00:46:23,608 --> 00:46:25,669
flow of gameplay, so now I'm just wandering around this area

629
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:28,031
uselessly. Um,

630
00:46:28,271 --> 00:46:29,632
No, you're doing well,

631
00:46:29,832 --> 00:46:32,173
you can see an area that's a little bit...

632
00:46:32,634 --> 00:46:34,774
Kind of interesting and curious over there.

633
00:46:34,794 --> 00:46:37,935
Yeah, I'm trying to remember if this is something you do now or if you do it later.

634
00:46:38,435 --> 00:46:39,655
Because it's the stupid...

635
00:46:39,675 --> 00:46:41,916
That's a good question. I think it's later.

636
00:46:42,656 --> 00:46:44,036
Yeah, well, let's try and get over there.

637
00:46:46,656 --> 00:46:46,817
Oh!

638
00:46:48,657 --> 00:46:48,777
Oh!

639
00:46:49,677 --> 00:46:49,897
No.

640
00:46:50,777 --> 00:46:52,217
Ha ha ha ha! No.

641
00:46:53,678 --> 00:46:56,718
Yeah, but that was actually an interesting challenge with, um...

642
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:01,099
With narrative and level design and game design all paired together is...

643
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,862
That question, which is, can the players access this now?

644
00:47:07,222 --> 00:47:11,785
So that's not necessarily something we came up against in previous games, because of course they

645
00:47:11,825 --> 00:47:17,488
were a little bit more linear in the way that you move through the spaces, like Mikhail was

646
00:47:17,528 --> 00:47:25,012
talking about before. But we would have to work more closely with the other departments in terms

647
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:29,654
of, okay, so what does the player know in the story? Which characters have they met? What

648
00:47:29,694 --> 00:47:31,315
could they potentially uncover?

649
00:47:32,324 --> 00:47:35,605
and then make sure that we distributed, for example, the optional content,

650
00:47:35,665 --> 00:47:37,846
all those documents accordingly,

651
00:47:37,946 --> 00:47:41,247
and make sure we didn't spoil anything that might come later.

652
00:47:42,087 --> 00:47:45,088
If players could sort of decided not to, you know,

653
00:47:45,148 --> 00:47:48,509
do main missions one after another and explored and went to side missions,

654
00:47:49,029 --> 00:47:52,631
we had to make sure that, you know, all of those secrets were well kept.

655
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:57,972
So, for example, there, Anna-Marie made sure that drop would kill you.

656
00:47:57,992 --> 00:47:59,813
You didn't make the drop.

657
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:07,727
But mainly so that you don't necessarily spoil things for yourself either.

658
00:48:07,767 --> 00:48:10,450
But yeah, we had to be careful about that actually.

659
00:48:11,491 --> 00:48:12,633
So that was interesting.

660
00:48:12,953 --> 00:48:14,235
That was an interesting challenge.

661
00:48:14,702 --> 00:48:19,365
Brooke, while I've got you here, one of my favorite things to ask a narrative designer about is

662
00:48:20,006 --> 00:48:24,189
I often feel very strongly that the content of games is informed by the tools they are made.

663
00:48:24,529 --> 00:48:27,992
So I'm curious, especially as someone who gets to make the Oceanview motel,

664
00:48:28,352 --> 00:48:32,015
how you felt working with, I don't know if you worked directly with the Northland Engine

665
00:48:32,055 --> 00:48:33,636
or if you were using other tools with it,

666
00:48:34,697 --> 00:48:37,939
but I'm curious how you felt as a storyteller your ability to

667
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:43,163
execute the vision that McCall was talking about was affected by how you were making it.

668
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,682
Yeah, I mean, I personally wasn't jumping into the engine.

669
00:48:48,722 --> 00:48:53,965
I mean, I did a lot of playtesting, and I did a lot of build reviews and things like that.

670
00:48:54,225 --> 00:48:59,228
One of our other narrative designers was doing a lot of the...

671
00:48:59,868 --> 00:49:06,772
We have a tool that we use to do a lot of that stuff that had to do with dialogue and pacing.

672
00:49:06,852 --> 00:49:12,395
I mean, well, I lie. I did use the tool to do a lot of the optional content setup and things like that.

673
00:49:13,397 --> 00:49:14,698
So that was really interesting.

674
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:24,740
Funnily enough, there were some interesting limitations around how we could make the documents work with the text.

675
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,141
And I actually think that that was really helpful because it meant that we were like,

676
00:49:29,241 --> 00:49:36,922
okay, so we can do a lot of documentation, but we can't put heaps of pictures on them because of the way the tool works.

677
00:49:36,962 --> 00:49:39,403
We could put some, but it actually...

678
00:49:39,991 --> 00:49:46,096
you know, made us be creative with the idea of what kind of funny, like, office documentation

679
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:54,302
would you find around, and actually being quite spare with the amount of words that

680
00:49:54,322 --> 00:49:55,403
we could use as well.

681
00:49:56,644 --> 00:49:59,926
So we really just had that sort of one page to use.

682
00:50:00,007 --> 00:50:03,089
We, you know, some games sort of let you flick through pages.

683
00:50:04,047 --> 00:50:10,650
So we had to be pretty sparing, which I think was good. I think that limitation meant that we had snappier

684
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:16,073
documents to read, and there are quite a few to read, but they don't take a long time in and of themselves.

685
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:22,536
So that was interesting. But then also for me, for my work, a lot of what I was doing was

686
00:50:23,557 --> 00:50:29,280
doing a lot of the vision holding for the side missions and for the motel, which I'll talk about in my talk.

687
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:30,540
But for the side missions,

688
00:50:31,482 --> 00:50:36,966
Clay, our writer, one of our writers would be in the room with me and they would be taking

689
00:50:37,026 --> 00:50:43,110
notes of what Jessie needs to say or take note of or what she might say to help players

690
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:48,213
along in the particular side mission and a lot of what I was doing was often walking

691
00:50:48,273 --> 00:50:51,094
between departments talking to the level designer and sound design.

692
00:50:52,242 --> 00:50:55,524
Getting a list of animations that we need for those side missions,

693
00:50:56,084 --> 00:51:00,627
getting lists of like, and getting that sent off so they could be mo-capped and things like that.

694
00:51:00,707 --> 00:51:08,271
So a lot of like detail orientated work to make sure that the narrative is being carried across

695
00:51:08,351 --> 00:51:16,275
in the whole mission, but it's not necessarily to do with just the dialogue. So yeah, making sure

696
00:51:16,335 --> 00:51:17,696
all of that is accounted for.

697
00:51:18,379 --> 00:51:23,543
letting Clay know that, you know, Jessie will need to do something in this side mission, I don't know, like

698
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:27,486
turn off the clog or, I don't know,

699
00:51:28,547 --> 00:51:33,231
solve a puzzle with the radio, and so then she needs a line that's probably specific to that.

700
00:51:34,431 --> 00:51:41,137
So a lot of that is feeding information to the people, you know, that what they need to be able to do their particular thing.

701
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:47,316
So that's a lot of my work in the development part anyway.

702
00:51:48,016 --> 00:51:49,177
Let's close off this chat.

703
00:51:50,718 --> 00:51:54,240
Folks in chat have been asking great questions.

704
00:51:56,502 --> 00:52:02,045
But I'm going to close off with a little bit of a tease for your talk about the Oceanview Motel.

705
00:52:02,737 --> 00:52:06,181
Um, what I would like to know is the Oceanview, you mentioned that the

706
00:52:06,221 --> 00:52:07,943
Oceanview Motel is a transit space.

707
00:52:08,003 --> 00:52:10,746
It lets you sort of pick up the player from one area and move them to another

708
00:52:11,146 --> 00:52:14,609
with this in-between zone of passing through, you know, a sort of Pacific

709
00:52:14,649 --> 00:52:17,913
Northwest-y motel and we're getting a great look at the lobby today.

710
00:52:20,335 --> 00:52:25,876
In that space, you do some of the most interesting, like it sort of underlines the theme of the game in a very specific way,

711
00:52:25,896 --> 00:52:32,478
which is, you know, the odd interacting with mundane objects creates dramatic consequences.

712
00:52:34,038 --> 00:52:42,000
And I would just like to know, what was your process for architecting the little interactions and then the little,

713
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:44,761
I guess like, you know, they have these supernatural payoffs a little bit.

714
00:52:45,581 --> 00:52:45,841
Yes.

715
00:52:45,901 --> 00:52:48,081
Because the interior as you go on.

716
00:52:49,802 --> 00:52:51,902
What was your process for coming up with some of those?

717
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,343
Yeah, so some of the...

718
00:52:54,483 --> 00:52:59,244
So when I jumped onto the motels, there were prototypes for puzzles for them.

719
00:53:00,304 --> 00:53:04,385
And some of them were really great, and I took elements of them and redesigned them,

720
00:53:04,526 --> 00:53:11,467
only because some of them had fallen out of the narrative mood and tone.

721
00:53:11,627 --> 00:53:13,468
So they were a little bit too...

722
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:20,655
obvious, but the reason for that was they were somewhat placeholder saying like put a mysterious cool puzzle here

723
00:53:20,715 --> 00:53:22,136
and this is what it could look like.

724
00:53:23,056 --> 00:53:29,080
And then I went ahead and worked with the different level designers and sort of proposed my own puzzle designs that were

725
00:53:31,022 --> 00:53:33,683
simpler admittedly, but also a bit

726
00:53:34,684 --> 00:53:40,108
weirder and then I can't completely take credit for the puzzles themselves because

727
00:53:40,621 --> 00:53:45,082
I would have an idea and talk to the level designer about them, and then they would have

728
00:53:45,122 --> 00:53:50,944
suggestions about how to make it more readable and work better technically, and then we would

729
00:53:50,964 --> 00:53:52,064
go back and forth on that.

730
00:53:52,984 --> 00:53:59,526
And a lot of what I would do is pitch the props for the motels and the environment and

731
00:53:59,626 --> 00:54:04,367
talk about what it should look and feel like, and I worked with our environment artist,

732
00:54:04,447 --> 00:54:10,148
Mikey, and sat with her, and we looked at things together and reviewed it together.

733
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:12,641
So that was really fun.

734
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:16,822
And then some of the motels are really specific and have a very specific theme.

735
00:54:17,903 --> 00:54:20,484
I don't know how much I should say so as not to spoil.

736
00:54:20,964 --> 00:54:23,025
But, um, so those ones...

737
00:54:23,325 --> 00:54:27,387
If it's like from the first couple of motel levels, like, feel free to spoil it, just because the game has been out for a minute.

738
00:54:27,467 --> 00:54:34,170
Okay. Well, so, um, well the Arkti motel for example, there's one that's got a very Finnish theme to it.

739
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:38,332
And so we were for the longest time thinking about what that should be.

740
00:54:38,645 --> 00:54:43,067
feel like, and Sam had some pretty clear ideas for it, so it was making sure that we were

741
00:54:43,107 --> 00:54:45,208
delivering on that for him.

742
00:54:45,928 --> 00:54:51,451
And I also worked with the sound designer to design the stinger for when you successfully

743
00:54:51,611 --> 00:54:53,832
solve a puzzle, like what that should sound like.

744
00:54:54,352 --> 00:55:01,155
Because it's really tempting to be really obvious or on the nose, but because you're

745
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:04,037
getting a strange pyramid key from the board.

746
00:55:04,536 --> 00:55:08,177
We sort of figured that something that sounded like that would be really cool.

747
00:55:08,617 --> 00:55:13,939
And you know, some of my happiest moments on the game is, you know, sitting with these other

748
00:55:15,099 --> 00:55:22,562
super talented people and helping them and them helping me realize the vision for the motel

749
00:55:22,602 --> 00:55:27,743
sequences. So it's going to be a real pleasure to talk about it and delve into detail for the talk.

750
00:55:31,266 --> 00:55:35,409
For folks who are able to GDC March 16th to the 20th, if you

751
00:55:35,849 --> 00:55:38,071
look at your screen, you will see the date on the upper left

752
00:55:38,091 --> 00:55:41,633
hand corner. You can check out Brooks's talk. It's not

753
00:55:41,673 --> 00:55:44,015
scheduled yet. I don't know what day and time it is. I'm sorry.

754
00:55:44,035 --> 00:55:47,037
But that's okay. I don't know either. So it would be a

755
00:55:47,057 --> 00:55:48,017
complete mystery.

756
00:55:52,199 --> 00:55:54,940
Yeah, uh, with that, I'm going to start wrapping up our stream.

757
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:55,901
Thank you all.

758
00:55:55,921 --> 00:55:56,341
Oh my God.

759
00:55:56,661 --> 00:55:58,722
I still have my connect plugged in and it thought I yelled it.

760
00:55:59,002 --> 00:56:05,446
Um, uh, um, uh, with that, I'm going to start wrapping up our stream.

761
00:56:05,466 --> 00:56:07,547
Thank you everyone for rolling.

762
00:56:07,827 --> 00:56:09,448
Surprising technical difficulties today.

763
00:56:09,488 --> 00:56:13,350
Congratulations to Brooke McCall and everyone else at Remedy, Sam, and a lot

764
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,731
of the folks who worked on this game.

765
00:56:14,951 --> 00:56:15,051
Um.

766
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:21,434
I'm personal friends with one of the people who works in pre-production on the writing,

767
00:56:21,454 --> 00:56:24,281
Abigail Threshold, who did all that.

768
00:56:25,665 --> 00:56:27,626
Oh yeah, yeah. Oh my gosh, yeah.

769
00:56:27,646 --> 00:56:29,227
I'm so sorry we didn't get to show them off today,

770
00:56:29,247 --> 00:56:31,109
because they are one of my favorite things about this game too.

771
00:56:32,370 --> 00:56:34,731
Yeah, shout out to them, shout out to everyone who worked really hard

772
00:56:35,472 --> 00:56:37,914
to bring this game to life through all parts of the process.

773
00:56:39,695 --> 00:56:42,537
With that, I need to do my shilling for who we are and what we do.

774
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:44,078
We are Game Developers Conference.

775
00:56:44,539 --> 00:56:45,679
Thank you folks for tuning in.

776
00:56:45,719 --> 00:56:48,702
If you're not a game developer, you should know that we go live regularly.

777
00:56:49,182 --> 00:56:56,207
We're doing two streams today where we are going to be interviewing the folks from the Outer Wilds team.

778
00:56:56,707 --> 00:56:57,808
Oh, amazing.

779
00:56:58,148 --> 00:56:59,389
Yeah, that game is so cool.

780
00:56:59,829 --> 00:57:01,891
Oh yeah, that'll be fun.

781
00:57:01,931 --> 00:57:04,173
They have also been nominated for the Game Developers Choice Award.

782
00:57:04,233 --> 00:57:08,616
I'm sorry, I guess you're competing with them, but hey, you know, everyone wins at the GCA.

783
00:57:08,636 --> 00:57:12,358
What a compliment to be competing with them.

784
00:57:12,882 --> 00:57:19,564
Yeah, um, yeah, so we're gonna be talking with them starting at 3pm EST, that's 12pm Pacific.

785
00:57:20,064 --> 00:57:22,964
Um, I don't know any other time zones from that, but it's up to you to figure out.

786
00:57:23,564 --> 00:57:27,805
Um, from there, uh, so if you hit the follow button you'll get a notification when we go live.

787
00:57:27,925 --> 00:57:34,267
If you'd like to attend GDC, you can totally, um, uh, just hit the, uh, button at the bottom

788
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:37,567
of the screen. I've set up a button down there so you can get your pass.

789
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:42,308
Um, if you want to check out, uh, is your talk on the Nerdif Summit or is it somewhere else?

790
00:57:43,385 --> 00:57:44,265
In the narrative summit.

791
00:57:44,405 --> 00:57:49,087
If you're in the narrative summit, you'll want to get a summit's pass to see Brooks talk.

792
00:57:49,867 --> 00:57:54,789
But if you get anything from an expo, you can attend the awards on the 18th, no matter

793
00:57:54,829 --> 00:57:55,669
what badge you have.

794
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:58,250
So you should totally do that.

795
00:57:58,931 --> 00:58:02,432
And if you're not going to attend the awards, if you're not going to attend the show in

796
00:58:02,472 --> 00:58:06,694
person, like I said, it'll be streaming live on Twitch, so you can watch there.

797
00:58:06,794 --> 00:58:08,334
So you should follow for that reason too.

798
00:58:09,135 --> 00:58:09,875
That's what's happening.

799
00:58:09,915 --> 00:58:10,855
There's more people spawning.

800
00:58:13,254 --> 00:58:14,275
You're doing a good job!

801
00:58:14,736 --> 00:58:18,182
Yeah, uh, talking, interviewing, and playing.

802
00:58:18,322 --> 00:58:20,345
I know, I don't know how you do it.

803
00:58:20,506 --> 00:58:21,647
This is a really good clip.

804
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:24,011
I'm just saying it's a good thing I played this game once already.

805
00:58:24,172 --> 00:58:25,354
Dr. Darling, um...

806
00:58:26,055 --> 00:58:26,636
There he is.

807
00:58:27,829 --> 00:58:32,391
Maniac536, this stream will eventually be archived on YouTube.

808
00:58:32,451 --> 00:58:36,173
That technical glitch we had earlier may mean I can't just push a button and send it over.

809
00:58:36,253 --> 00:58:40,116
I may need to hop into a video editor and stitch it back together.

810
00:58:42,377 --> 00:58:45,539
With that in mind, I would like to thank everyone for watching.

811
00:58:45,579 --> 00:58:48,440
Thank you, Brooke and the folks at Remedy for setting this stream up.

812
00:58:49,001 --> 00:58:52,603
And I cannot wait to see your talk at GDC.

813
00:58:52,623 --> 00:58:55,985
Awesome. Thank you so much. It's been a pleasure.

814
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:59,239
Have a good day everyone and enjoy your ventures in the oldest house.

815
00:58:59,279 --> 00:59:01,962
And if you're gonna stick with us for the Outer Wilds, uh, drop.

816
00:59:02,662 --> 00:59:02,863
Hank.

817
00:59:03,023 --> 00:59:03,824
See you in a couple hours.

818
00:59:04,164 --> 00:59:04,444
Bye.

819
00:59:04,464 --> 00:59:04,524
Bye.
