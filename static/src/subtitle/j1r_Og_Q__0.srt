00:00:03,778 --> 00:00:07,400
Welcome everyone to my talk in VRDC. I'm Chad Dawson. I'm a

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,723
project lead at Double Fine Productions. The title of my

3
00:00:10,743 --> 00:00:16,306
talk is Reinventing Psychonauts for Virtual Reality. I'm

4
00:00:16,326 --> 00:00:18,568
currently working on a Psychonauts game at Double Fine,

5
00:00:18,608 --> 00:00:21,250
Psychonauts and the Rhombus of Ruin. It's for Sony's PlayStation

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,112
VR. It's an upcoming title coming out in the next few

7
00:00:24,132 --> 00:00:28,795
months. First I'll give an overview of what we're talking

8
00:00:28,815 --> 00:00:29,235
about today.

9
00:00:30,342 --> 00:00:33,164
why Psychonauts in VR. We'll start with some inspiration on

10
00:00:33,204 --> 00:00:36,367
kind of how we got the idea to take Psychonauts to VR and why

11
00:00:36,387 --> 00:00:39,289
we picked that title to work on. Then we'll start talking about

12
00:00:39,409 --> 00:00:43,532
adaptation, changes we made to gameplay, locomotion, controls.

13
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:48,395
Iteration, how we iterated on the controls and targeting, went

14
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:50,497
through a number of different prototypes, eventually settled

15
00:00:50,557 --> 00:00:54,599
on the control configuration that we came up with. And then

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,340
finally innovation.

17
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,124
how we overcame design challenges. With any project you run into hurdles, you run into

18
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:03,227
things that don't work right and things that do. We'll give a few examples of what worked

19
00:01:03,247 --> 00:01:10,174
for us and might work for you as well. It all started just over a year ago, summer of 2015. We

20
00:01:10,815 --> 00:01:13,658
were all excited as most of you are about the new VR tech coming out.

21
00:01:14,679 --> 00:01:17,542
I had done some research back in grad school in the 90s with the

22
00:01:17,602 --> 00:01:21,485
old lawnmower man style giant helmets, some prototypes back

23
00:01:21,525 --> 00:01:24,667
then. A number of our team had backed the Oculus Rift, we're

24
00:01:24,687 --> 00:01:28,310
playing around with the DK2s. As a studio, Double Fine has always

25
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,373
kind of taken on new technology. We made games for the Microsoft

26
00:01:31,393 --> 00:01:34,716
Connect, Happy Action Theater, Connect Party, and we also did

27
00:01:34,756 --> 00:01:37,818
some for the Leap controller, one called Autonomous.

28
00:01:39,088 --> 00:01:41,830
We had a lot of ideas but we weren't really sure which one

29
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,033
would be best. We were kind of all over the place but Double

30
00:01:45,073 --> 00:01:47,015
Fine had something else in the works, something our fans had

31
00:01:47,035 --> 00:01:51,399
been asking for a long time. Psychonauts 2. We planned on

32
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,383
crowdfunding Psychonauts 2 later that same year and we hit on an

33
00:01:55,463 --> 00:01:58,906
idea. As Tim was starting to write the story for these, there

34
00:01:58,946 --> 00:02:02,109
was a missing part and we thought, what if we made a

35
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:03,050
Psychonauts VR game?

36
00:02:06,485 --> 00:02:09,247
It could tell the story between Psychonauts 1 and Psychonauts 2

37
00:02:10,148 --> 00:02:13,930
and it would be in VR. It would come out earlier than Psychonauts

38
00:02:13,971 --> 00:02:16,152
2 and accelerate our art and engine pipeline. We wanted to

39
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,594
get together some assets and stuff for starting the crowd

40
00:02:18,614 --> 00:02:21,015
funding for it, but we didn't have much look development done

41
00:02:21,055 --> 00:02:26,959
yet. But how would Psychonauts work in VR? Released in 2005,

42
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,563
Psychonauts was an action platformer. How many of you are

43
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,924
familiar with the original game? Show of hands. Okay, most of

44
00:02:33,964 --> 00:02:34,304
you. Good.

45
00:02:35,102 --> 00:02:37,666
It's an action platformer using third person follow cam. As you

46
00:02:37,686 --> 00:02:40,049
can see here, your main character Raz, he's an acrobat.

47
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:44,494
Features double jumps, high speed rail slides, wild gravity

48
00:02:44,554 --> 00:02:46,917
flips, dynamic motion combat.

49
00:02:47,607 --> 00:02:49,467
We quickly learned that following this type of motion

50
00:02:49,487 --> 00:02:52,808
with a camera in VR can be very disorienting and make players

51
00:02:52,848 --> 00:02:55,468
physically uncomfortable and sick if you try to just latch a

52
00:02:55,488 --> 00:02:58,309
camera to it. We started experimenting with fixed and

53
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:01,130
rail cams to try to reduce the camera motion a little bit when

54
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,450
we were trying stuff out, but it pulled us too far away from our

55
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:08,231
characters and was still making us a bit nauseous. But Psychonauts

56
00:03:08,251 --> 00:03:12,112
had more going on than just dynamic third-person action.

57
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,311
Looking past the camera mechanics of the game, it also

58
00:03:15,351 --> 00:03:17,952
received critical acclaim for its unique visual style,

59
00:03:18,613 --> 00:03:22,854
stylized look, story, characters and the humor. A significant

60
00:03:22,894 --> 00:03:25,015
part of the game was told through cinematic cut scenes and

61
00:03:25,035 --> 00:03:28,077
vignettes like this one, featuring camera pans, close-ups

62
00:03:28,397 --> 00:03:31,278
and handcrafted animation. When you ask many people about the

63
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:33,419
game, I think this is kind of what they remember getting to

64
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,860
know the characters as much as they do the third person action.

65
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,742
But cinematic camera movements like this are a bit jarring in

66
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:42,723
VR. It's hard to pan the camera in and do a close-up.

67
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:46,904
without the player feeling uncomfortable. And other

68
00:03:46,944 --> 00:03:49,324
techniques like letter boxing to tell the player you're in

69
00:03:49,364 --> 00:03:51,845
cinematic mode, none of your controls will work, didn't make

70
00:03:51,905 --> 00:03:55,286
much sense. Our artists were starting on the visual

71
00:03:55,306 --> 00:03:58,686
development. We were bringing our characters up to more modern

72
00:03:58,746 --> 00:04:02,267
rendering technique. And we're using the Unreal 4 engine. You

73
00:04:02,287 --> 00:04:04,068
can see the characters look a lot different than they did 10

74
00:04:04,288 --> 00:04:04,648
years ago.

75
00:04:05,867 --> 00:04:08,169
They did an amazing job getting the characters in lighting and

76
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:10,611
we really wanted to show off that expressiveness. We didn't

77
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:12,793
want to put you in a camera just behind the character where you

78
00:04:12,813 --> 00:04:15,455
couldn't see the expressions on their face or have them be far

79
00:04:15,495 --> 00:04:19,919
away where you couldn't tell what they were doing. So for

80
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,782
inspiration, we looked at story and development in the original

81
00:04:23,822 --> 00:04:28,126
title. In Psychonauts, Raz, as shown here in this video, had

82
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,088
the ability to travel into other characters' minds.

83
00:04:30,932 --> 00:04:33,175
but you never really got to see what it was like in Raz's mind.

84
00:04:33,195 --> 00:04:36,118
You never really got to see things from his perspective. We

85
00:04:36,138 --> 00:04:38,500
started to explore first person camera to see what would it look

86
00:04:38,521 --> 00:04:42,425
like to be looking out the eyes and the famous goggles of Raz

87
00:04:42,465 --> 00:04:50,173
himself. This is some footage of our new game. In this case we

88
00:04:50,193 --> 00:04:51,254
show the first person mode.

89
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:55,714
This perspective feels more immersive. It finally feels like you're actually in the world of

90
00:04:55,734 --> 00:05:00,276
psychonauts and not just seeing it from above running behind a character. This sense of scale

91
00:05:00,377 --> 00:05:05,339
felt more personal. The familiar characters from the game took on new life. There's more of a

92
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:10,421
connection of a character like Lily here as she fails to meet your gaze, looks down or draws

93
00:05:10,441 --> 00:05:12,462
your attention by looking over your shoulder.

94
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,541
The adult character here has to lean down to talk to you. That's

95
00:05:16,561 --> 00:05:18,861
something you didn't see in the first game, that sense of scale.

96
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:23,263
That you're a kid, you're a 12-year-old boy and you're with

97
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:27,464
adults. They lean down to talk to you. That sense of them being

98
00:05:27,504 --> 00:05:31,345
condescending to you or nice to you, you get a better feel for

99
00:05:31,385 --> 00:05:32,545
it as soon as you get in first person.

100
00:05:36,084 --> 00:05:38,487
This perspective worked well as we started to look at the

101
00:05:38,507 --> 00:05:42,053
psychic abilities. In the first game Raz was at psychic summer

102
00:05:42,073 --> 00:05:44,557
camp and he learned how to do all psychic powers. One of our

103
00:05:44,597 --> 00:05:47,782
favorite was pyrokinesis. Lighting stuff on fire with your

104
00:05:47,802 --> 00:05:49,264
mind is always kind of fun.

105
00:05:50,585 --> 00:05:52,808
side blast is also fun. There's nothing like shooting a bolt of

106
00:05:52,848 --> 00:05:55,632
lightning out of your head. This was particularly neat in VR. It

107
00:05:56,293 --> 00:05:59,036
felt like it was coming from your mind. Use it to blow stuff

108
00:05:59,136 --> 00:06:04,102
up and open doors. You can even use it to hit different things

109
00:06:04,162 --> 00:06:09,649
in the level. Particularly fun. But we wanted something, slide

110
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:09,829
there.

111
00:06:10,992 --> 00:06:13,513
There we go. Something a little bit more subtle. We added a

112
00:06:13,553 --> 00:06:16,535
psychic poke, sort of our bread and butter interaction players

113
00:06:16,896 --> 00:06:19,297
to touch the world a little less destructively. You don't always

114
00:06:19,317 --> 00:06:22,419
want to blow stuff up. This goes to a little bit point and click

115
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:24,921
adventure style where you're just interacting with something

116
00:06:24,961 --> 00:06:29,824
or just annoying your friends. My favorite adaptation was

117
00:06:29,864 --> 00:06:34,207
telekinesis, moving an object around with your mind. It works

118
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:38,190
surprisingly well in our game as you can pick objects up, move

119
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,151
around by moving your head.

120
00:06:40,414 --> 00:06:43,797
It worked well with our characters too. We added eye and head tracking. Characters would

121
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:48,442
follow what you're doing. They'd swat it away if it got too close. This added a sense of

122
00:06:48,482 --> 00:06:51,304
immersion to our characters that we didn't really have with them just sitting there doing

123
00:06:51,404 --> 00:06:56,549
idle animation loops. It made the characters feel more responsive, more alive. Many players

124
00:06:56,589 --> 00:07:00,293
were surprised. Once they figured out that they could do this and the characters would react

125
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:04,337
to it, they would spend the whole rest of the demo just trying to stack pillows and hit the

126
00:07:04,377 --> 00:07:05,277
other characters in the face.

127
00:07:07,276 --> 00:07:10,237
The more you can add to your game to do character interaction

128
00:07:10,337 --> 00:07:13,177
to have them respond to things and look at it, the more players

129
00:07:13,217 --> 00:07:16,598
will connect with your characters. We now have a

130
00:07:16,618 --> 00:07:18,959
pretty compelling experience from Raz's perspective, just

131
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:21,860
sitting there and looking around. But how would the player

132
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,960
move through the world? We know we wanted our levels to be

133
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,261
bigger than just one room where you're sitting in one spot. Our

134
00:07:27,301 --> 00:07:28,782
next challenge was locomotion.

135
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,912
Two of our guiding design principles in making this game

136
00:07:31,932 --> 00:07:34,093
were accessibility and comfort. The original game was

137
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:37,476
accessible to a lot of people, a wide range of audience and a

138
00:07:37,736 --> 00:07:40,578
wide range of player styles. Some people went to the game

139
00:07:40,618 --> 00:07:44,421
just for the story. Others went for it for the fun mechanics. We

140
00:07:44,441 --> 00:07:46,502
wanted to include all of them. We recognize that for many

141
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:49,564
players, this could be their first VR experience. We didn't

142
00:07:49,584 --> 00:07:51,886
want them taking off the headset after the first few minutes and

143
00:07:51,926 --> 00:07:52,506
not coming back.

144
00:07:53,426 --> 00:07:56,228
The game itself is a little bit longer than a few demos that are

145
00:07:56,248 --> 00:07:58,589
only a few minutes. We're looking at around a two to three

146
00:07:58,609 --> 00:08:01,571
hour experience that we're hoping the player, some players

147
00:08:01,631 --> 00:08:04,653
might play start to finish from beginning to end, but we divide

148
00:08:04,673 --> 00:08:07,814
it up into smaller chunks. We wanted to preserve a comfortable

149
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:10,916
seated experience. We wanted to avoid VR nausea of running

150
00:08:10,956 --> 00:08:14,599
around, jumping players to the world that some people get with

151
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,541
more action-paced games. Again, we turned to the original

152
00:08:18,561 --> 00:08:19,682
Psychonauts for inspiration.

153
00:08:21,303 --> 00:08:24,485
In the original game, the player could walk up to another character and use the psychic

154
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:29,286
power of clairvoyance to briefly see things through another character's point of view. In

155
00:08:29,326 --> 00:08:32,548
this demo, you see them going up to characters and they see Raz a little bit differently.

156
00:08:33,008 --> 00:08:36,669
Sometimes their perspective on the world can be a little bit different. One of them sees them

157
00:08:36,689 --> 00:08:42,231
as a hockey player, another sees them as a hockey player one there. It all depends on their

158
00:08:42,251 --> 00:08:45,072
personality. It really lets you sort of develop the characters out.

159
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,871
So we thought rather than clairvoyance just giving the

160
00:08:50,891 --> 00:08:53,252
player a temporary viewpoint, what if we use that as our

161
00:08:53,292 --> 00:08:55,893
locomotion? What if we use that to be a persistent point of

162
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:58,674
view? The player could target another character across the

163
00:08:58,714 --> 00:09:03,296
room and then jump into their mind. Now they'd see things from

164
00:09:03,316 --> 00:09:05,997
that character's perspective. The player could stay in that

165
00:09:06,057 --> 00:09:09,018
point of view as long as they wanted, looking around, using

166
00:09:09,038 --> 00:09:11,719
their abilities. They could even clairvoyance into yet another

167
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,741
character, look around and use their abilities from there. With

168
00:09:15,761 --> 00:09:16,981
this method of teleportation,

169
00:09:17,703 --> 00:09:19,623
We can move the player around from character to character in

170
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:22,604
different points of the room. You can chain clairvoyance from

171
00:09:22,684 --> 00:09:25,085
one character to another, going back to characters you've been

172
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:28,646
before and move between a number of points in the world. Your

173
00:09:28,686 --> 00:09:31,207
main character, Raz, the character you're in, stays in

174
00:09:31,267 --> 00:09:32,968
one place using his psychic ability.

175
00:09:36,988 --> 00:09:40,609
This was also working with our story line. We wanted the characters to be captured. We

176
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:45,130
wanted them to figure out a way to escape. We were shifting more from the platforming stuff

177
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:49,290
in the original game to more of a puzzle based experience using your psychic abilities to solve

178
00:09:49,310 --> 00:10:06,394
puzzles. Can you guys hear? I should have a little audio. Let's see if I can turn it up.

179
00:10:10,006 --> 00:10:25,457
Are you getting any audio in the audio out? Let me try that again. Well, this video we're

180
00:10:25,477 --> 00:10:29,681
showing here, not audio, but I can talk you through it a little bit. It shows an example of

181
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:34,184
using all your gameplay abilities. Here the player must use clairvoyance to go into a rat

182
00:10:34,224 --> 00:10:37,266
in an overhead compartment. They must use poke to open up cabinets.

183
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,061
They see a character over the right sticking his hand out of

184
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:43,524
the bathroom door. They use telekinesis to grab toilet paper

185
00:10:43,564 --> 00:10:46,447
and hand it to him. He shouts back at them that it's not

186
00:10:46,487 --> 00:10:49,771
enough. He needs something a little bit more. What else can

187
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:55,477
you do? So in this case the player realizes they can use

188
00:10:55,497 --> 00:10:59,501
their telekinesis ability and their pyro ability together to

189
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,143
give the coach in the background a little surprise.

190
00:11:04,954 --> 00:11:08,055
It's a different type of game play, but it's something we're shifting to more with puzzles.

191
00:11:09,196 --> 00:11:13,497
But an important consideration was also our controller scheme. We wanted to keep it simple

192
00:11:13,637 --> 00:11:17,478
and accessible. All the different controllers coming out, we didn't want to limit our

193
00:11:17,518 --> 00:11:21,960
audience to ones that just had hand controllers. We wanted it to be able to work with the

194
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,640
game pad as well.

195
00:11:26,111 --> 00:11:29,073
Initially we considered looking at a pop-up menu to select

196
00:11:29,133 --> 00:11:31,995
abilities like the original game did. In the original game you

197
00:11:32,035 --> 00:11:34,077
could select from your different abilities and map that to one

198
00:11:34,097 --> 00:11:36,239
of your buttons and have a couple of them going. But we

199
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:39,961
really wanted to focus on you combining your abilities. And we

200
00:11:39,981 --> 00:11:43,304
wanted to limit the amount of UI. Having a UI pop up all the

201
00:11:43,344 --> 00:11:45,385
time you wanted to use an ability in our game, which you

202
00:11:45,425 --> 00:11:49,128
use pretty often, would be a little bit annoying to see it

203
00:11:49,148 --> 00:11:52,951
come up in your face. And tricky as your world environment could

204
00:11:52,991 --> 00:11:53,411
obscure the UI.

205
00:11:56,024 --> 00:11:57,966
We ended up doing a controller mapping that mapped the

206
00:11:58,006 --> 00:12:00,268
abilities to the different buttons. That way the player

207
00:12:00,288 --> 00:12:06,254
could use multiple abilities at the same time. This had a number

208
00:12:06,274 --> 00:12:10,358
of challenges using a game pad controller. The first was

209
00:12:10,398 --> 00:12:13,641
unfamiliarity. When you're in a VR headset, most players can't

210
00:12:13,681 --> 00:12:16,124
look down and see what their controller is doing. If they

211
00:12:16,164 --> 00:12:18,246
don't know the controller very well, they're not going to know

212
00:12:18,286 --> 00:12:20,488
what different buttons are no matter how much you tell them.

213
00:12:21,762 --> 00:12:24,744
So to solve that, we showed the full controller diagram.

214
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,445
Rather than just showing a symbol of a button to press,

215
00:12:27,525 --> 00:12:30,708
which someone might not remember, a triangle or an L2

216
00:12:30,948 --> 00:12:34,410
button or an X, show a picture of the whole controller with

217
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,191
the button highlighted.

218
00:12:35,391 --> 00:12:37,492
This technique worked particularly well, as players

219
00:12:37,532 --> 00:12:39,634
can fumble around with the controller and try to get

220
00:12:39,654 --> 00:12:41,095
their thumb or finger in the right position.

221
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:43,996
As long as you're forgiving with the controls, they'll

222
00:12:44,037 --> 00:12:44,537
find the button.

223
00:12:46,318 --> 00:12:48,339
But too much familiarity can also cause an issue.

224
00:12:49,062 --> 00:12:53,629
people coming from using game pad controllers with other games typically like to use the

225
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:58,517
sticks. Initially we let the right stick move the camera. We quickly found that that was not a

226
00:12:58,537 --> 00:13:03,144
good thing to do. Having people move the camera with their head and also right stick can

227
00:13:03,164 --> 00:13:04,206
really make you sick fast.

228
00:13:04,968 --> 00:13:09,611
but you shouldn't discount players using the controllers completely. By watching people's

229
00:13:09,631 --> 00:13:12,693
hands when they're play testing, we're able to figure out which buttons they felt were

230
00:13:12,713 --> 00:13:18,396
intuitive. Some of the combinations like holding down telekinesis and pyro, some players had

231
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:24,760
an intuition on kind of which trigger finger might be used for telekinesis and which ones

232
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:31,304
would be easier to combine with others. We also explored a motion track game pad

233
00:13:31,324 --> 00:13:31,745
controller.

234
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:36,270
On the PlayStation, some of you may know the dual shot

235
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,272
controller has a sensor in the front and sensors inside which

236
00:13:39,312 --> 00:13:42,153
let the camera which tracks your head also track the position of

237
00:13:42,173 --> 00:13:45,475
the controller. For telekinesis we combined letting you move it

238
00:13:45,495 --> 00:13:48,217
around with your head, moving it around with the controller and

239
00:13:48,257 --> 00:13:49,778
moving it around with the sticks. We tried all

240
00:13:49,838 --> 00:13:52,379
combinations of those to see what people found would work

241
00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:57,041
well. We actually found that moving around your head worked

242
00:13:57,061 --> 00:14:00,123
well with our game because it gave you more of a feeling that

243
00:14:00,143 --> 00:14:00,723
you were psychic.

244
00:14:01,347 --> 00:14:03,289
Once you started moving it around with your hands using a

245
00:14:03,329 --> 00:14:06,492
controller, it started to feel like it was something in your

246
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,035
hand that you were reaching out. But to give you that sense of

247
00:14:09,095 --> 00:14:10,877
presence that you were psychically moving it, moving

248
00:14:10,897 --> 00:14:14,781
your head worked. We also had a wide variation of what players

249
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:18,704
would do when they would hold the controller. Many players

250
00:14:18,744 --> 00:14:20,766
would just like to hold it in their lap. Not many would

251
00:14:20,806 --> 00:14:22,949
intuitively lift it up and try to move it from a seated

252
00:14:22,989 --> 00:14:23,509
experience.

253
00:14:24,415 --> 00:14:28,158
In addition to using it for telekinesis, we had it work with rotation where players could flip

254
00:14:28,218 --> 00:14:33,081
objects around. But flipping the controller over 180 puts it in a weird configuration for

255
00:14:33,101 --> 00:14:37,064
people to hold and try to hit the other buttons. Eventually with our design we backed away

256
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:41,327
from rotating objects. We left it as an option on the right stick, but it's more for players

257
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:49,313
to just inspect something, and we didn't use it for any critical game play. Our targeting,

258
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:53,095
we used the headset rather than using a hand controller to point at things.

259
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,711
we look at stuff with your head. And as I was saying, we found

260
00:14:56,731 --> 00:15:00,273
this had an unexpected but pretty desirable effect of the

261
00:15:00,313 --> 00:15:03,414
player feeling more like a psychic. We found that if you

262
00:15:03,434 --> 00:15:06,435
were using your mind to control something, if you were trying to

263
00:15:06,475 --> 00:15:09,437
look at it with your head and move it, rather than a track

264
00:15:09,457 --> 00:15:13,178
controller or wand in your hand, it felt less like a magic wand,

265
00:15:13,239 --> 00:15:15,660
less like a laser pointer, less like a tool in your hand. You

266
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,841
felt more like a psychonaut in the game than a wizard or an

267
00:15:18,921 --> 00:15:22,523
artist or a mechanic. But it ran into a set of issues as well.

268
00:15:24,373 --> 00:15:27,756
With head track targeting, players are less precise. It's

269
00:15:27,796 --> 00:15:29,977
rare for someone to hold their head and look at something with

270
00:15:30,017 --> 00:15:35,841
a fixed gaze and hold it in the exact spot for very long. To

271
00:15:35,881 --> 00:15:41,505
combat that, we did generous and sticky target selection. When

272
00:15:41,545 --> 00:15:43,967
you look at something in our game, it would highlight. And we

273
00:15:43,987 --> 00:15:46,049
had a number of different objects and players would try to

274
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:48,030
look at them. But as we started building up the worlds, the

275
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,031
density got pretty big.

276
00:15:49,827 --> 00:15:51,788
We tried to reduce that and reduce the number of things you

277
00:15:51,808 --> 00:15:54,168
could target but still players had trouble figuring out what

278
00:15:54,188 --> 00:15:56,629
they were targeting and if they were targeting it correctly.

279
00:15:57,069 --> 00:15:58,809
Sometimes they would see something and try to turn their

280
00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:00,970
head to look at it but would have a hard time getting it

281
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:05,090
under a cursor or getting it under their view. To do that we

282
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,291
opened up our selection and made it more generous and sticky.

283
00:16:07,771 --> 00:16:09,971
Generous meaning you didn't have to look exactly at something,

284
00:16:10,351 --> 00:16:12,692
you just had to look near it and it would find the closest one.

285
00:16:13,212 --> 00:16:15,653
And sticky meaning when you looked away it would still keep

286
00:16:15,673 --> 00:16:16,833
your selection on it for a while.

287
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:24,564
We also didn't require accuracy. Initially our puzzles had the player being very accurate

288
00:16:24,605 --> 00:16:28,647
with stuff. You had to pick up a bomb, move it to a hallway without it touching the walls or it

289
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:34,051
would explode, or insert a key into a lock and turn it. All of these were tricky to do and we

290
00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:38,494
had some players on the team who were pretty good at it, but for most players it was hard to

291
00:16:38,534 --> 00:16:44,939
do. Particularly if you started to get neck fatigue. Moving your head around a target and

292
00:16:44,979 --> 00:16:48,942
particularly moving stuff around is one of the primary inputs. People's necks can get tired.

293
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:53,683
To combat that we tried to limit the required movement range.

294
00:16:54,724 --> 00:16:56,487
We didn't want to have the players have to move something

295
00:16:56,527 --> 00:16:58,530
from the far left side of their vision to the far right,

296
00:16:59,191 --> 00:16:59,832
or up and down.

297
00:17:00,393 --> 00:17:01,354
We didn't want you to have to do

298
00:17:01,394 --> 00:17:02,736
repeated movements over and over.

299
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:05,260
We also removed time pressure.

300
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:09,098
As I said initially we had a ticking time bomb that you had

301
00:17:09,138 --> 00:17:11,540
to get down the hallway without hitting the wall. People would

302
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,423
try to do that really fast. One of the tricks you could do to it

303
00:17:14,483 --> 00:17:17,866
was to sling your neck really fast to throw the object down

304
00:17:17,886 --> 00:17:21,570
the hall. Players would do that. Some would do it quite violently

305
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,572
and almost shake the headset off because they were running out of

306
00:17:23,612 --> 00:17:28,256
time. So in our game design we started removing anything that

307
00:17:28,296 --> 00:17:30,938
gave the player time pressure and tweaking the puzzles to be

308
00:17:30,998 --> 00:17:31,199
more...

309
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,321
more solution finding on what to move and where to put it as opposed to how to do it in a quick

310
00:17:37,341 --> 00:17:43,942
amount of time. Dialogue was also a challenge for us. Double fine games have always had

311
00:17:44,322 --> 00:17:48,623
charming dialogue and quite a lot of it. But sometimes you need to give feedback on what the

312
00:17:48,643 --> 00:17:54,925
player is doing, particularly if they're doing something wrong. Initially we had some generic

313
00:17:55,225 --> 00:17:59,686
dialogue responses. Things like oop or bummer or nope if you tried to do something and the

314
00:17:59,706 --> 00:18:00,726
player wasn't succeeding.

315
00:18:01,685 --> 00:18:05,148
but as we started play testing it, players got confused. We

316
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,069
were watching them play and hearing the sounds and knowing

317
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:09,651
what they were doing wrong, but the players weren't getting the

318
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:14,834
feedback. We started changing the statements to be a little

319
00:18:14,854 --> 00:18:19,638
bit more specific. Rather than just a generic thing, be more

320
00:18:19,678 --> 00:18:21,679
particular and state the verb and object in what you're

321
00:18:21,699 --> 00:18:25,021
saying. Say I can't burn that book or that crate is too heavy

322
00:18:25,061 --> 00:18:28,023
to lift. Often when players are looking around,

323
00:18:28,739 --> 00:18:33,341
they'll hit a button, hit the wrong button, think they're doing pyrokinesis on something to

324
00:18:33,381 --> 00:18:37,343
burn it, but they're actually trying to pick it up. They're looking at an object just to the

325
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:41,785
right of the object they were trying to pick up, so getting a specific response back really

326
00:18:41,805 --> 00:18:44,987
helps keep them on the right track and make sure they don't get confused or misdirected.

327
00:18:45,988 --> 00:18:48,890
It's something that with a point and click adventure game and a

328
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:52,073
lot of other game styles, people tend to leave their cursor on

329
00:18:52,093 --> 00:18:54,414
the object they're interacting with. They take their focus on

330
00:18:54,454 --> 00:18:57,376
it. But if you're doing head based tracking, players will

331
00:18:57,396 --> 00:19:00,999
look at something and then look away. So reminding them what

332
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:02,620
they were doing and what they were looking at can often be

333
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,623
helpful. We love the clairvoyance mechanic of

334
00:19:06,663 --> 00:19:08,584
traveling through our levels from one character's mind to

335
00:19:08,624 --> 00:19:10,605
another, but it also gave us a few problems.

336
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,083
When you teleport to a character, we would use the way that character is facing to give you a

337
00:19:16,123 --> 00:19:19,725
hint at where you're going to be looking once you go into them. In this picture on the left,

338
00:19:19,765 --> 00:19:24,208
you can see the character Mia staring at the monitor. If you go into her perspective,

339
00:19:24,488 --> 00:19:29,031
that's what you're going to see. That worked out great. We put characters close to things. She

340
00:19:29,071 --> 00:19:32,994
could watch a whole cartoon show on that monitor, switch the channels, solve a puzzle with

341
00:19:33,054 --> 00:19:34,935
it. But then what would you do?

342
00:19:35,837 --> 00:19:37,920
Because she was close to it and facing a wall,

343
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:40,344
she didn't have any other characters in her field of view.

344
00:19:40,885 --> 00:19:42,267
In order to move to another character

345
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,568
using our locomotion system,

346
00:19:43,969 --> 00:19:45,732
the player would have to look over their shoulder

347
00:19:45,932 --> 00:19:47,674
or turn around 180 in their chair and get up.

348
00:19:48,415 --> 00:19:49,938
And that's something we wanted to try to avoid.

349
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:53,616
This is the top view of the level we were looking at in the

350
00:19:53,656 --> 00:19:56,598
jet. The roof is cut away and you can kind of see the shape of

351
00:19:56,658 --> 00:20:00,340
it. Raz, your main character, is shown in the center and I've

352
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,102
highlighted his field of targeting in yellow. I use the

353
00:20:03,122 --> 00:20:05,444
phrase field of targeting instead of field of view. Field

354
00:20:05,484 --> 00:20:08,405
of view can often be pretty wide. In fact, you can look all

355
00:20:08,425 --> 00:20:11,427
around you 360. But your field of targeting is more limited.

356
00:20:12,348 --> 00:20:14,129
Field of targeting is kind of what you're going to turn your

357
00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:15,890
head to look at as you use head-based targeting.

358
00:20:16,938 --> 00:20:20,541
We found that a range of around 90 to 120 degree arc would work.

359
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:22,543
Sometimes we had to open it up a little bit more,

360
00:20:22,643 --> 00:20:25,445
but that's what most players felt comfortable with.

361
00:20:26,986 --> 00:20:29,148
Vertical up-down head movement, a pitch arc

362
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:30,969
of looking up and down to find another character,

363
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:31,790
is definitely less.

364
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,691
But most of our levels featured more

365
00:20:33,711 --> 00:20:36,434
of a horizontal layout design than a vertical one.

366
00:20:37,214 --> 00:20:38,835
In this level, we showed you going up

367
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,276
into the squirrel in an overhead bin.

368
00:20:40,717 --> 00:20:42,678
That's about the level we'd go in vertical.

369
00:20:45,305 --> 00:20:47,906
Here you can see overlapping fields of other characters

370
00:20:47,926 --> 00:20:48,746
targeting each other.

371
00:20:49,726 --> 00:20:50,867
Those are also shown in yellow.

372
00:20:51,187 --> 00:20:53,587
If you look in the center, you can see the center three

373
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,228
characters have overlapping field of view.

374
00:20:55,768 --> 00:20:57,688
All of them have another character within their arc.

375
00:20:58,489 --> 00:21:00,249
But none of them have a good view of the character in the

376
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:00,749
upper right.

377
00:21:01,329 --> 00:21:03,430
He's a hard character to get to unless we rotate one of the

378
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,110
character's seats.

379
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:06,691
And that sort of became our tuning game in the levels of

380
00:21:06,731 --> 00:21:09,131
going through and saying, can you see somebody else from

381
00:21:09,151 --> 00:21:09,992
this position or not?

382
00:21:10,932 --> 00:21:12,932
You might also notice that we don't have very good coverage

383
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:14,933
in the back of the plane seen on the left hand side.

384
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:18,411
We had to come up with a creative solution so the player

385
00:21:18,431 --> 00:21:20,573
could easily get back there and find the toilet paper to hand

386
00:21:20,593 --> 00:21:24,958
the coach hanging out in the bathroom. So as shown on the

387
00:21:24,998 --> 00:21:27,380
left here, we added a squirrel in an overhead bin who had a

388
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,563
good point of view of that area. Some level layouts work out

389
00:21:30,603 --> 00:21:33,486
better than others. This is something we discovered probably

390
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:35,528
about halfway, three quarters of the way through the project. I

391
00:21:35,548 --> 00:21:37,790
wish we would have known earlier. Long rectangular

392
00:21:37,831 --> 00:21:39,172
levels don't work too well for this motion.

393
00:21:41,281 --> 00:21:45,584
this type of locomotion. You have to have characters facing the front and also ones facing

394
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:51,570
the back so you can move from one end to the other. It turns out with no small coincidence

395
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:57,775
that our second level was a circle. And a lot of our other levels after that ended up being

396
00:21:57,995 --> 00:22:00,437
this way. This is an example of our outpost level.

397
00:22:02,737 --> 00:22:06,721
might be a little hard to see because of the yellow light in the center, but we positioned

398
00:22:06,741 --> 00:22:10,966
a bunch of guards around the outside. In making a circular level, and I've seen a few other

399
00:22:11,006 --> 00:22:14,729
games do this where they do an arena kind of style, with a bunch of characters on the

400
00:22:14,769 --> 00:22:18,413
outside facing in, you always have a clear point of view of where you're going to go

401
00:22:18,613 --> 00:22:21,916
and where you're going to go to. It also helps with the player's sense of...

402
00:22:22,987 --> 00:22:27,149
sense of spatiality. Where am I in the level? Sometimes we found when you would go to a

403
00:22:27,189 --> 00:22:30,631
character and they were facing a way you hadn't seen, players would lose their sense of

404
00:22:30,671 --> 00:22:34,613
direction. They wouldn't quite know where they were or how to get back. Circular level

405
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:37,594
design worked pretty good because you can position them on the outside and they can

406
00:22:37,634 --> 00:22:47,479
always see in with multiple targets to choose from. So to wrap things up a little bit and

407
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:51,221
to conclude what we're talking about, just don't add VR to your title.

408
00:22:52,423 --> 00:22:55,504
It's just because your game can be played on a headset doesn't

409
00:22:55,524 --> 00:22:59,565
mean it's the right title for VR or that it's the right platform

410
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:04,205
for it. Adapt your gameplay and controls to the strength of your

411
00:23:04,245 --> 00:23:06,426
medium and your title. In looking at the original

412
00:23:06,446 --> 00:23:08,606
Psychonauts game, we found a number of features that we felt

413
00:23:08,626 --> 00:23:11,567
would work well. The psychic abilities, we extended some

414
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:14,407
features like the clairvoyance to not just give you a different

415
00:23:14,447 --> 00:23:16,968
view but to let you get around the world and see characters

416
00:23:16,988 --> 00:23:20,668
from a different perspective. Try to find the things in your

417
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:20,908
game.

418
00:23:21,937 --> 00:23:25,279
particularly if you're adapting one that map well to VR. But

419
00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:29,122
then also look at what in VR works well for your game. It

420
00:23:29,162 --> 00:23:31,383
might be a first person perspective works better for

421
00:23:31,423 --> 00:23:33,244
you. It might be you want to keep a third person's

422
00:23:33,264 --> 00:23:35,666
perspective. It's great to be seeing all the things that

423
00:23:35,686 --> 00:23:38,028
people are doing out there. And that kind of brings me to the

424
00:23:38,068 --> 00:23:40,209
next point. It's still a new and fertile ground.

425
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:45,193
You'll hear people in some of their talks and some things say that they've solved locomotion,

426
00:23:45,233 --> 00:23:49,796
or they've solved targeting, or they've solved shooting, but the more I've seen on the different

427
00:23:49,836 --> 00:23:52,599
titles, the more I've seen people doing it different ways, and different ways that work

428
00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:57,082
right for their game, for what they're trying to do. So feel free to explore. Just because

429
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:01,705
someone else is doing something a certain way, don't feel like you don't have to test it again

430
00:24:01,725 --> 00:24:06,029
yourself. You might find that what didn't work for them, what didn't work for us even, with the

431
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:10,552
hand controllers and rotating objects, might be perfect for your game, depending on the context.

432
00:24:12,227 --> 00:24:16,567
but also realize you're going to have unexpected challenges. Like I showed at the end, the

433
00:24:16,587 --> 00:24:20,308
character facing, we thought our locomotion system was great, but then we realized you

434
00:24:20,328 --> 00:24:24,329
couldn't get around many of the levels. We had to reposition characters, add new characters.

435
00:24:24,989 --> 00:24:29,350
That can come, if that comes too late, it might be hard for you to correct that. Give

436
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:33,611
yourself time to explore them. Give yourself a chance to get your new ideas in, iterate

437
00:24:33,711 --> 00:24:37,332
on them, and get them to a point where you can really shine.

438
00:24:42,703 --> 00:24:56,596
That wraps things up. Do you guys have any questions? Yeah, if

439
00:24:56,616 --> 00:24:58,137
you could state your name and the question, I'll repeat it

440
00:24:58,157 --> 00:24:58,798
back for everybody.

441
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:03,924
Hi, Caitlin.

442
00:25:04,844 --> 00:25:07,325
How do you deal with, when you have clairvoyance

443
00:25:07,766 --> 00:25:12,088
to teleport into another character's presence or mind,

444
00:25:12,588 --> 00:25:14,269
how do you deal with the fact that you're suddenly

445
00:25:14,729 --> 00:25:17,010
occupying another character's body?

446
00:25:18,331 --> 00:25:20,011
Like if you're moving your hand controllers,

447
00:25:20,031 --> 00:25:21,112
do you see the avatars?

448
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:26,677
the other NPC's hand moving. Okay, sure. Let me restate it.

449
00:25:26,697 --> 00:25:29,519
Caitlin was asking when you go into another character, how do

450
00:25:29,539 --> 00:25:31,942
you deal with the player accepting that other character's

451
00:25:31,982 --> 00:25:34,684
body? That's one thing I didn't mention in the talk but that we

452
00:25:34,704 --> 00:25:38,507
looked at and many games look at is when you're in a character,

453
00:25:38,668 --> 00:25:40,289
do you draw the character's body or not?

454
00:25:40,982 --> 00:25:43,302
Because we weren't using hand controllers and we weren't

455
00:25:43,342 --> 00:25:45,523
mapping your arm movements, it felt kind of weird for your

456
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:48,463
character to be sitting there not really mapping you. So when

457
00:25:48,483 --> 00:25:51,364
we go into a character, we don't draw their body at all. We turn

458
00:25:51,404 --> 00:25:54,145
off props and accessories they have like a pencil or notebook

459
00:25:54,665 --> 00:25:57,326
so you don't see your character. We found that most players found

460
00:25:57,346 --> 00:26:01,247
that more acceptable. We do do certain things like change your

461
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:03,167
eye distance to make you feel smaller or bigger.

462
00:26:04,016 --> 00:26:06,377
in limited amount of scales if you go into a small character.

463
00:26:06,917 --> 00:26:09,158
And we do, in certain characters, not shown,

464
00:26:09,218 --> 00:26:10,298
they see the world differently.

465
00:26:10,718 --> 00:26:12,799
They might see a sunny day instead of a rainy day.

466
00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:14,379
Our characters a little bit differently

467
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:15,600
to try to give their personality.

468
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,560
But in general, we don't draw the body.

469
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,641
That's the choice we made.

470
00:26:19,921 --> 00:26:20,281
Go ahead.

471
00:26:20,301 --> 00:26:21,121
My name is Yost.

472
00:26:22,637 --> 00:26:26,599
It seems like all the abilities you have in the game fit very nicely with the original

473
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:30,762
Psychonauts game. Was there anything you guys wanted to do in the game that you couldn't

474
00:26:30,982 --> 00:26:35,045
make fit with the original game and you scrapped or just couldn't explain away?

475
00:26:35,645 --> 00:26:40,368
Right. We looked at, so to ask this question, he was, Rose was it, was asking were there

476
00:26:40,388 --> 00:26:42,670
any abilities in the original game that didn't work.

477
00:26:44,243 --> 00:26:46,725
A lot of the original game was combat focus, so blowing stuff

478
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:50,407
up. Like I said, we shifted to a little bit more puzzle solving.

479
00:26:50,507 --> 00:26:52,969
We added that one ability just to give something a light poke,

480
00:26:53,349 --> 00:26:55,731
a little bit more of a point and click interaction. But there

481
00:26:55,771 --> 00:26:57,952
were abilities in the original game that I thought would be

482
00:26:57,992 --> 00:27:01,435
cool to put in that we didn't, such as invisibility. We tried

483
00:27:01,455 --> 00:27:03,316
to figure out a way to do it, but since we weren't drawing

484
00:27:03,336 --> 00:27:06,318
your character, you were kind of already invisible. We thought

485
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:08,520
we might tweak it to make other stuff invisible, but that's

486
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,762
something we might look at at DLC or an add-on. There's always

487
00:27:11,802 --> 00:27:12,202
more to add.

488
00:27:13,973 --> 00:27:19,077
Hopefully that answers your question. Thanks. Go ahead.

489
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:21,678
I have a question. You brought up something very interesting

490
00:27:21,698 --> 00:27:24,840
with level design specifically. I was wondering if you found

491
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,582
that painting points of interest vertically things that were

492
00:27:27,682 --> 00:27:29,943
above the player, if you had a challenge getting their

493
00:27:29,963 --> 00:27:33,405
attention that way. So his question was with level design,

494
00:27:33,545 --> 00:27:36,727
did we look at the challenges of moving vertically? We did a

495
00:27:36,747 --> 00:27:39,629
little bit. Some of our initial puzzles you were in a prison

496
00:27:39,769 --> 00:27:42,070
that was very vertical based with a lot of prison cells and

497
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,271
different levels that you would go up.

498
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,321
We do a few things.

499
00:27:45,521 --> 00:27:48,804
We have a particular sort of boss battle in the game with a

500
00:27:48,844 --> 00:27:51,807
giant character that's bigger than you that you look up and

501
00:27:51,827 --> 00:27:52,447
you have to fight.

502
00:27:53,348 --> 00:27:55,130
One thing we found is that we didn't really want to keep the

503
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,672
player looking up a lot, particularly our game where

504
00:27:57,692 --> 00:27:58,653
you're moving stuff around.

505
00:27:58,733 --> 00:28:00,955
If your neck is craned at an angle and you're having to

506
00:28:00,975 --> 00:28:02,096
move stuff with your neck craned.

507
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,420
people got fatigued a lot sooner. For simple navigation or

508
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,921
drawing someone's attention, I think it works pretty well. It's

509
00:28:07,961 --> 00:28:10,942
nice to hear a sound up there or see something and look up. That

510
00:28:10,962 --> 00:28:12,862
really gives you a sense of scale and perspective,

511
00:28:13,062 --> 00:28:16,863
particularly on levels with open skies and bigger spaces. But we

512
00:28:16,883 --> 00:28:19,844
didn't really use it for navigation too much. Thank you.

513
00:28:22,204 --> 00:28:24,345
Anybody else? One coming from the back.

514
00:28:29,242 --> 00:28:33,105
So I'm assuming you didn't ever try to twist their head around

515
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:36,026
basically, right? You let them move and look at things. But did

516
00:28:36,046 --> 00:28:39,428
you ever try experimenting with maybe gently moving their head?

517
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:43,531
We did a little bit. And how did that go? One thing we wanted to

518
00:28:43,571 --> 00:28:47,313
focus on was you were going into a player's point of view and you

519
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:51,875
were in that view. I've seen some games, I think the recent

520
00:28:51,895 --> 00:28:55,097
Batman Arkham one has where you can press a button and your view

521
00:28:55,137 --> 00:28:55,758
suddenly switches 180.

522
00:28:57,554 --> 00:29:01,717
We tried a technique like that, but it felt like you were more of a ghost hovering over their head.

523
00:29:02,117 --> 00:29:07,362
It kind of lost that connection with you being in the character. As I said, if you see a way a character is facing,

524
00:29:07,802 --> 00:29:11,425
that gave you a clue at what you might see. You might see that character kind of peeking around a wall,

525
00:29:11,865 --> 00:29:17,249
and you go into them and see around that wall. That connection of kind of being in that character's head was something we wanted to preserve.

526
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:21,993
But sometimes we do cheat it. We have an eye locator on every character which is where your

527
00:29:22,153 --> 00:29:25,595
eye is going to be when you go into him. Sometimes we'll cheat it up a little bit and

528
00:29:25,615 --> 00:29:29,938
you'll be a foot over their head or a foot in front or left. Not too far. Usually between like

529
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:33,761
a foot to three feet distance from a character. And we found that since we don't draw the

530
00:29:33,801 --> 00:29:37,924
player's body, most players don't notice. You can move it down a little bit or up a little

531
00:29:37,944 --> 00:29:46,090
bit and that works pretty well. Cool. Thank you. Anyone else?

532
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,506
All right, well, thanks for coming to my talk.

533
00:29:49,586 --> 00:29:49,908
Again, I'm.
