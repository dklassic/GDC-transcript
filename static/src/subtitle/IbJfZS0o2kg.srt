1
00:00:08,437 --> 00:00:08,777
All right.

2
00:00:09,658 --> 00:00:10,319
Hello, everyone.

3
00:00:10,899 --> 00:00:13,081
Welcome to my talk, Lessons in Lens Flares.

4
00:00:14,002 --> 00:00:21,409
Apologies for the brief technical difficulties there, but before we start, just a brief introduction.

5
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,992
So my name is Anup.

6
00:00:24,312 --> 00:00:30,998
I'm a real-time VFX artist at FXVille, and I've been a hobbyist photographer, filmmaker, and animator for over 20 years.

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,621
I'm also a lens flare enthusiast.

8
00:00:36,277 --> 00:00:42,542
So before we get right into it, I just wanted to give a brief overview of what this presentation is all about.

9
00:00:43,303 --> 00:00:56,193
There's a lot to talk about and limited time, so I'll be focusing more on discussing the key behaviors of different lens flares and how to create your own than giving a technical presentation on creating lens flares in any specific game engine.

10
00:00:58,097 --> 00:01:04,881
As with many things in game development, I've found that there isn't really a one-size-fits-all solution for lens flares in game engines.

11
00:01:05,781 --> 00:01:11,644
So in this talk, I'm going to be focusing more on explaining the key behaviors of lens flares and my process for creating them.

12
00:01:12,745 --> 00:01:26,973
The reason this is relevant is essentially because as hardware improves and visual fidelity increases, lens flares are becoming an increasingly common task for real-time VFX artists, whereas they may have previously been considered more of a technical art task.

13
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:41,636
So today, I'll begin by talking about the interaction between light and the camera lens before discussing some of the differences between spherical and anamorphic lenses using reference footage of shot.

14
00:01:42,596 --> 00:01:48,780
After that, I'll discuss some general rules and rules of thumb to help you author your own lens flares, supplemented by more footage.

15
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,983
And then finally, I'll show you my process for making a custom lens flare in After Effects.

16
00:01:57,897 --> 00:02:01,340
and we'll open it up to a quick Q&A after that, if time permits.

17
00:02:03,821 --> 00:02:08,485
All right, so let's begin with a simplification of how light interacts with the camera.

18
00:02:09,465 --> 00:02:15,409
In a modern camera lens, there's generally a bunch of glass lens elements that make up what we refer to as the lens.

19
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:22,995
So before light can reach the image sensor, it's reflected and refracted as it passes through these lens elements.

20
00:02:25,362 --> 00:02:34,488
When I'm creating a lens flare, I like to think about the journey of light from the front element to the rear element and how that might affect the shapes, colors, and behaviors of my flare.

21
00:02:35,228 --> 00:02:40,512
I also look at reference footage and think about which lens elements correspond to which flare elements.

22
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:56,687
It's worth noting lens manufacturers usually apply an anti-reflective coating to these that tends to influence the color of flare elements as well as the overall intensity and certain other factors, but we'll get into that later.

23
00:03:00,296 --> 00:03:05,660
To help create lens flares in any instance, here's a list of important concepts and rules I've compiled.

24
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:12,765
We'll be discussing each of these in depth, but I wanted to run them up on the screen here first so that we can reference this slide later.

25
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:27,696
Knowing these concepts as well as the context in which a flare will exist can make it a lot easier to implement a visually compelling lens flare that truly complements the overall composition of the frame while also respecting the physical nature of a real camera.

26
00:03:30,947 --> 00:03:37,152
So first on our list, the two major types of lenses we typically use are spherical and anamorphic lenses.

27
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:43,457
Both produce vastly different lens flares, image artifacts, and out-of-focus bokeh effects.

28
00:03:43,577 --> 00:03:48,061
So understanding the difference between these is important when creating a flare of your own.

29
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:53,657
So let's start with the far more common spherical lens.

30
00:03:54,598 --> 00:04:03,765
When shooting with a spherical lens, we generally expect to see radial rays around the light source, where the number of rays will usually correspond to the number of diaphragm blades.

31
00:04:04,706 --> 00:04:17,115
For those who may not know, aperture blades or diaphragm blades are the swiveling mechanical blades that control the size of the aperture, which essentially dictates how much light is let into the image sensor.

32
00:04:18,557 --> 00:04:20,258
And there's a stock image of what those look like.

33
00:04:21,985 --> 00:04:30,629
With spherical lenses, we also expect to see circular or polygonal bokeh and ghosts, which we haven't talked about just yet, but we'll be getting into that soon.

34
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:38,373
Similarly, we see the number of sides of polygonal bokeh correspond to the number of aperture blades.

35
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:49,779
And while it's perhaps not the most relevant to us in our real-time VFX context, it is important to note that we usually expect a 16 by 9 aspect ratio when shooting with a spherical lens.

36
00:04:50,543 --> 00:04:59,368
which is great because 16 by nine is the most typical aspect ratio for our computer monitors, TVs, smartphones, and other displays.

37
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:15,458
So generally, the framing and aspect ratio you see when shooting with a spherical lens is what you ultimately get in the final image before any post or editing, cropping work has been done.

38
00:05:17,098 --> 00:05:20,280
And so here's some reference footage I shot on a spherical lens.

39
00:05:22,261 --> 00:05:28,864
What you can see is that I have 14 aperture blades here, so we get 14 radial rays coming off the light source.

40
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:34,664
And moving right along to my favorite, anamorphic lenses.

41
00:05:35,724 --> 00:05:40,006
So in general, anamorphic lenses tend to make things look and feel a lot more cinematic.

42
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:51,930
They can also create a more painterly look than spherical lenses, which is due in part to their unique bokeh or out of focus effects, as well as their distortion.

43
00:05:53,631 --> 00:05:58,333
With an anamorphic lens, we tend to get horizontal streaks as our primary flare element,

44
00:05:59,653 --> 00:06:05,414
And depending on the lens, radial rays may also be present in an anamorphic flare, as we'll see here in a moment.

45
00:06:08,355 --> 00:06:19,818
They tend to have slightly different visuals and behaviors than the radial rays that we'd see or associate with spherical lenses, but a good rule of thumb is that they have more asymmetry.

46
00:06:21,635 --> 00:06:27,700
Anamorphic lenses also produce vertically stretched oval-shaped bokeh for anything that's out of focus.

47
00:06:28,781 --> 00:06:34,166
However, the ghosts that we see in anamorphic flares can be vertically or horizontally stretched oval shapes.

48
00:06:37,126 --> 00:06:46,718
And another quirk of anamorphic lenses is that they produce an aspect ratio of 2.39 by 1, which is standardized as 21 by 9 for the digital format.

49
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:50,263
There's a lot to talk about in this regard, so I'm going to keep it brief.

50
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:55,650
But essentially, when we're shooting with an anamorphic lens, we're actually shooting on a square.

51
00:06:57,342 --> 00:07:12,406
So the original footage needs to be desqueezed in an editing or compositing software so that we ultimately get that 21 by 9 widescreen aspect ratio with the signature cinematic black bars on the top and bottom of the screen.

52
00:07:15,827 --> 00:07:18,628
And here's some reference footage I shot of my anamorphic lens.

53
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:31,855
you can see we get that primary, our primary element is those horizontal streaks and we get boxy shapes, especially when we're shooting into the sun.

54
00:07:33,015 --> 00:07:34,876
It's very common with anamorphic lenses.

55
00:07:37,717 --> 00:07:43,219
And just to contrast that, here's some more reference of my phone's flashlight.

56
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:47,180
So you can see the flare elements are quite different.

57
00:07:50,347 --> 00:07:54,590
And then here's what that original footage would have looked like before the desqueeze.

58
00:07:54,650 --> 00:08:03,076
So we've got a completely square aspect ratio and everything is sort of squashed horizontally.

59
00:08:07,059 --> 00:08:14,425
All right, so we've already touched on the radial rays and horizontal streaks associated with spherical and anamorphic lenses respectively.

60
00:08:15,265 --> 00:08:18,548
But perhaps the most common flare element is glare.

61
00:08:20,283 --> 00:08:28,266
Generally speaking, glare appears as a large, soft element around the light source that reduces the contrast of the image in the areas that it occupies.

62
00:08:32,327 --> 00:08:34,308
And next up, let's talk about ghosts.

63
00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:48,653
So ghosts are bokeh-like elements that rotate around the center of the screen, appearing stuck to a line that is an invisible line, but one that's drawn between the center of the screen and the light source.

64
00:08:51,212 --> 00:09:00,779
Ghosts often appear as copies or inverted copies of the light source and tend to show the light source shape, although that's another sort of rule of thumb.

65
00:09:05,061 --> 00:09:08,264
And next up we have halos, which tend to be pretty weird.

66
00:09:09,304 --> 00:09:14,408
These are usually circular or elliptical shaped elements that radially warp the light source.

67
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:24,688
Halos tend to be especially visible when the light source is outside the screen edges, but again, that depends on the lens.

68
00:09:25,988 --> 00:09:32,672
It's also worth noting that halos can manifest in many different ways, but something they usually have in common is chromatic aberration.

69
00:09:35,734 --> 00:09:39,556
And finally, my absolute favorite element, lens dirt.

70
00:09:40,901 --> 00:09:51,124
So if we can imagine a car windshield or something similar that accumulates dirt and grime from being exposed to the outdoors, lens dirt is very similar in concept.

71
00:09:52,084 --> 00:10:04,647
Essentially, these are small bits of dust and dirt that may be caked onto the lens or may just be sitting on top of the front element that appears out of focus bokeh shapes when the front element is illuminated.

72
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:17,926
Usually a front element reflection is visible simultaneously with lens dirt, but as with everything else we've covered, it always depends on the lens being used, and every lens is different.

73
00:10:22,727 --> 00:10:28,813
and moving right along to wide angle versus telephoto for our focal length.

74
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:37,061
So whenever I'm explaining the difference between these two, I use the example of zooming in and zooming out on a digital camera.

75
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:52,991
So shooting with a wide-angle lens, we might expect to see lots of smaller ghosts and other flare elements, whereas when shooting with a telephoto lens, we generally expect to see fewer larger ghosts and other flare elements.

76
00:10:54,032 --> 00:11:07,723
This is perhaps not the greatest reference footage that we're about to see, but you can maybe see when we zoom in, we generally see fewer, yet larger flare elements.

77
00:11:17,203 --> 00:11:24,630
So moving right along, the main difference between a glancing and direct light source in this context is really just the subtlety of the flare.

78
00:11:25,331 --> 00:11:32,458
A light source that's at a glancing angle to the lens will usually result in a more subtle flare that's barely visible, if at all.

79
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:41,187
Whereas a light source that's shining directly into the lens will produce a much clearer and sharper flare with more visible elements.

80
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:51,596
I'm not going to spend too much time on this next one, but I thought it was worth mentioning just because it's something that I find very interesting.

81
00:11:52,637 --> 00:11:59,984
A light source that's outside the screen edges will generally produce a really unique element.

82
00:12:01,645 --> 00:12:08,472
And there's no official name for this that I've been able to find, but I generally refer to it as an outside edge flare.

83
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:19,148
So a light source that's right outside the screen edges, but still shining directly into the lens will produce this strange element.

84
00:12:19,308 --> 00:12:24,832
And we can think of this sort of like an anticipatory flare, just before the light source comes on screen.

85
00:12:32,212 --> 00:12:36,863
And so here's some reference of a light source that's at a glancing angle.

86
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:39,989
And then just more reference.

87
00:12:52,699 --> 00:12:57,843
So when it comes to the occlusion of the light source, ghosts tend to have the most erratic behavior.

88
00:12:58,523 --> 00:13:05,088
Their internal shape and color may change, and they may occlude in a staggered manner as the light source is occluded.

89
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:13,133
As far as the other elements are concerned, they generally tend to become increasingly more subtle or fade out entirely.

90
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:19,318
And so we'll see that here as I swing over to the left.

91
00:13:27,322 --> 00:13:37,432
And back again, you can see those ghosts just sort of, it's not linear fashion, they're just, they fade out in a strange order.

92
00:13:40,074 --> 00:13:40,695
Unpredictable.

93
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:51,903
And moving right along, something that I consider one of the most important concepts, depth of field or blur.

94
00:13:53,063 --> 00:13:58,647
So essentially, depending on whether or not the light source is in focus, flare elements will blur accordingly.

95
00:13:59,928 --> 00:14:06,692
With a light source that is in focus, we'd expect to see sharper, clearer flare elements than an out-of-focus light source.

96
00:14:07,793 --> 00:14:12,734
It's also worth noting that flare elements might change their shape and size while racking focus.

97
00:14:13,094 --> 00:14:16,575
And similarly, anamorphic flare elements tend to squash and stretch.

98
00:14:23,537 --> 00:14:29,758
So as I rack focus here, we'll see that these flare elements enlarge and become a lot softer.

99
00:14:52,748 --> 00:14:58,950
and then everything goes back to being somewhat squashed or stretched depending on which way I'm racking focus.

100
00:15:02,478 --> 00:15:04,239
And finally, chromatic aberration.

101
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,683
To quote Hannah Montana, nobody's perfect, and that includes lenses.

102
00:15:10,924 --> 00:15:16,628
So chromatic aberration is probably familiar to many of us artists, especially in the post-Spider-Verse era.

103
00:15:17,408 --> 00:15:26,574
But for those who may not know, chromatic aberration, or color fringing, is the failure of a lens to converge or focus all colors to the same point.

104
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:31,018
This results in color fringing as we get closer to the edges of the image.

105
00:15:32,158 --> 00:15:46,809
So flare elements like ghosts and halos can be affected by this phenomenon, but again, it's worth noting that all lenses are different, and these flare elements can manifest themselves very differently depending on the lens.

106
00:15:50,431 --> 00:15:56,496
And moving right along to light source color and the lens element coding, which we briefly touched on,

107
00:15:57,963 --> 00:16:01,384
but just some notes that I'm gonna bring up on the screen.

108
00:16:02,965 --> 00:16:22,913
Certain flare elements, there's no good rule of thumb here, you just gotta look at reference, but some flare elements will pick up the light source color, whereas some flare elements are gonna pick up the color that's sort of given from that flare, that lens element coating.

109
00:16:25,182 --> 00:16:34,348
and this is something that lens manufacturers work really hard to ensure that flares aren't too intense or intrusive or overwhelming.

110
00:16:38,871 --> 00:16:51,459
So here's some reference I shot of a prism and you can see that the flare elements that we're getting from that white light source from my phone

111
00:16:54,142 --> 00:17:05,034
not colored at all, or not picking up any other color other than what the lens elements were coated in.

112
00:17:05,595 --> 00:17:12,142
But when I run that through the prism, it's picking up a lot of that color.

113
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:17,061
And now it's time to put it all together.

114
00:17:17,462 --> 00:17:25,853
So to help conceptualize how we might create a lens flare in a game engine, I'll now demonstrate my process for creating a custom lens flare in After Effects.

115
00:17:26,774 --> 00:17:30,620
Before we begin, I'm going to show a list of effects and expressions that I'm using.

116
00:17:32,323 --> 00:17:38,285
And as I mentioned previously, I'll be doing my best to keep this a little bit less technical and more artistic.

117
00:17:38,665 --> 00:17:48,949
But for the technically minded folks out there, I will say that the most important thing to know when creating a lens flare in a game engine is knowing the screen space position of the light source.

118
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:57,832
You can use this as well as the distance between the light source and the center of the screen to drive the majority of your flare elements behaviors.

119
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,482
So before we get into it, I've got a couple expressions that I want to run up on the screen here.

120
00:18:07,422 --> 00:18:17,767
This first one is offsetting the X position of your element opposite to whichever way the light source is moving.

121
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:29,332
So it'll maintain its Y position, but it'll move in like negative X. And then similarly, I have a scale X by distance.

122
00:18:33,385 --> 00:18:36,828
And I have a couple of these, so I also have a scale opacity by distance.

123
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:58,083
And really it's just this kind of thing with any variation of, or anything you could potentially want to drive, any behavior, it's always going to be driven by the distance between the center of the screen and the light source in screen space.

124
00:19:00,855 --> 00:19:04,398
And I didn't really use this one, but it's worth running up here.

125
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:10,442
Rotate the flare element based on the light source's position.

126
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:19,728
All right, so here's how I start the setup and create the primary streak.

127
00:19:19,988 --> 00:19:24,129
First, I create a new composition, and I start making my light source shape.

128
00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:34,172
And if I were doing this as a post-process effect or to composite over footage, I'd actually do this a little bit differently, as we'll see here in a moment.

129
00:19:34,372 --> 00:19:41,354
But I actually start by applying a threshold to the scene and isolating my highlights that way.

130
00:19:42,234 --> 00:19:45,235
And you'll see an example of that momentarily right here.

131
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,217
And so that's what I'm talking about.

132
00:19:50,117 --> 00:19:56,539
Deriving your light source shape from whatever you have, the highlights in the scene.

133
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:02,001
And then I go ahead and I apply some effects and just start roughing in my shape.

134
00:20:03,262 --> 00:20:09,624
Once I get something that's working, I tend to duplicate it and just keep building out the shape that way.

135
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:23,437
and I always mask out my edges, especially when working in After Effects.

136
00:20:31,977 --> 00:20:35,860
This is generally something I consider to be one of the easier elements.

137
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,682
It follows the position of the light source.

138
00:20:40,223 --> 00:20:46,567
And you can duplicate your light source shape, scale it up, and blur it out a bunch.

139
00:20:47,868 --> 00:20:50,269
And that should get you something pretty good.

140
00:20:54,132 --> 00:20:55,573
And then, of course, mask out the edges.

141
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:05,233
All right, so for the radial rays, there's a number of different ways to do this.

142
00:21:05,574 --> 00:21:11,378
But in this instance, what I ended up doing is I scaled my light source shape horizontally.

143
00:21:12,139 --> 00:21:17,063
I moved it up and I applied a polar coordinates, which we'll see in a moment here.

144
00:21:18,063 --> 00:21:25,789
I also apply a wave warp to get some shape break up and sort of like a star kind of shape.

145
00:21:27,671 --> 00:21:28,832
And I do some adjustments.

146
00:21:30,505 --> 00:21:32,266
and then we'll see the polar coordinates right here.

147
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:44,436
And then after that point, you can apply a radial fast blur or something to radially blur those bits out.

148
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:51,322
You can also pinch the center using the bulge effect, whatever floats your boat.

149
00:22:02,942 --> 00:22:12,044
And it's worth noting that I always use the add blend mode when compositing these flare elements together in After Effects.

150
00:22:12,444 --> 00:22:17,125
Although, if I were compositing this over footage, I'd use the screen blending mode.

151
00:22:18,226 --> 00:22:23,947
However, if I were compositing this in a game engine, I'd probably want to use an additive material.

152
00:22:26,685 --> 00:22:29,587
And here you can see me roughing in some ghosts.

153
00:22:30,088 --> 00:22:39,996
So the key here is to tie the anchor point to the position, which gets that ghost element rotating around the center of the screen.

154
00:22:42,438 --> 00:22:52,887
And I also apply a radial fast blur to this and set the mode to darkest, which gets some of that occlusion behavior.

155
00:22:54,141 --> 00:23:01,685
So similar to ghosts, we have streak ghosts, which are the anamorphic streak elements.

156
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:09,630
And the way I set these up is a little bit different, but this is where that expression from the start comes in handy.

157
00:23:15,213 --> 00:23:17,274
And so you can see I'm getting the basic behavior.

158
00:23:20,621 --> 00:23:25,043
And once I get something that works, I just duplicate it and I just keep building it out that way.

159
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:37,610
Cool.

160
00:23:38,271 --> 00:23:47,396
So moving right along to our chromatic elements, I generally do this by creating a rainbow, blending it together,

161
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:21,573
and once I get something that's working, I just sort of duplicate and adjust as needed and I just copy paste those expressions from earlier and get the same kind of look.

162
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:27,720
You can also apply a VR glow and certain other effects to sort of get whatever kind of look you want.

163
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,321
and I do believe we're out of time here, unfortunately.

164
00:24:41,621 --> 00:24:45,743
So thank you all for watching, listening, and attending.

165
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:51,345
I'm just gonna get this process time lapse up.

166
00:24:53,505 --> 00:24:59,528
And so here's the whole roughly hour and a half process condensed into like a minute.

167
00:24:59,548 --> 00:25:03,149
And you can see I made my radial rays slightly differently here.

168
00:25:47,774 --> 00:25:48,537
and there you have it.

169
00:25:50,683 --> 00:25:52,368
Right, so thank you guys so much.
