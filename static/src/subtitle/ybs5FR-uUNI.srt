1
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:12,373
I'm Mike Daly and I was one of the guys that were involved in Lemmings and we'll take you through

2
00:00:12,393 --> 00:00:17,243
basically how it came about and some of the things we did on the project.

3
00:00:19,101 --> 00:00:21,363
I've been around for a long time.

4
00:00:21,383 --> 00:00:22,704
It's actually, I think, in August,

5
00:00:22,724 --> 00:00:24,806
it'll be 30 years in the games industry.

6
00:00:24,846 --> 00:00:26,908
So I've done quite a lot of bits and pieces,

7
00:00:27,768 --> 00:00:29,170
starting from Commodore 64,

8
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:34,655
going all the way through to high-end PC stuff and consoles.

9
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:38,037
Most recently, I was doing Game Maker studio work.

10
00:00:38,718 --> 00:00:41,360
So I've kind of touched most of the bases.

11
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:44,023
LIME still has a kind of fun place in my heart.

12
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:48,207
Lemmings obviously started at DME Design.

13
00:00:49,028 --> 00:00:52,130
This was founded by a group of friends

14
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:57,013
that all met in a computer club in Dundee in the mid-80s.

15
00:01:00,235 --> 00:01:01,315
That was our first office there,

16
00:01:01,335 --> 00:01:04,057
a tiny little pink office with two rooms.

17
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,939
Gary Timmons sitting in the window there.

18
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,302
And that's where all the Lemmings stuff really originated.

19
00:01:14,048 --> 00:01:15,109
Here's us in our youth.

20
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:17,851
I do still look like that.

21
00:01:17,891 --> 00:01:20,253
I'm just wearing a really good fat bodysuit just now.

22
00:01:21,754 --> 00:01:24,156
We've got Gary Timmons at the left, then Russell, Dave,

23
00:01:24,296 --> 00:01:25,997
myself, Steve Hammond at the bottom,

24
00:01:26,137 --> 00:01:29,700
then Brian Watson at the bottom there with Russell again.

25
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:33,222
As I said, we were in two rooms.

26
00:01:33,322 --> 00:01:35,083
So we had a big room at the front for development

27
00:01:35,404 --> 00:01:38,286
and then a smaller room at the back for office stuff

28
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:40,267
that was taken over for Dev later on.

29
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:45,701
So Lemmings really came about because of an argument.

30
00:01:47,462 --> 00:01:50,585
Dave was busy doing his second game, Blood Money.

31
00:01:51,465 --> 00:01:54,308
And the artwork that he got by a guy called Tony Smith

32
00:01:54,808 --> 00:01:56,129
was beautiful.

33
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:59,592
Some of the animations in it were just amazing for its time.

34
00:02:00,793 --> 00:02:03,855
One of the sprites that he gave us was a walker,

35
00:02:04,355 --> 00:02:06,837
the same two-legged walker that was in Star Wars,

36
00:02:06,857 --> 00:02:10,300
if you remember, the kind of mini-attack thing.

37
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,222
And for its time it was a really big sprite, beautifully animated.

38
00:02:15,943 --> 00:02:20,045
So Dave really fell in love with this thing and thought there could be a game in that.

39
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:23,246
So he hired a guy called Scott Johnson to come in.

40
00:02:25,649 --> 00:02:29,753
basically take this guy and give him things to shoot,

41
00:02:29,773 --> 00:02:30,994
some backgrounds and so on.

42
00:02:32,055 --> 00:02:37,580
So Scott started by drawing a man to shoot.

43
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,002
And the guy was about 16 by 16 pixels in size.

44
00:02:41,103 --> 00:02:42,304
But you can kind of see from this.

45
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:45,647
that, you know, he'd almost be up to the cockpit level.

46
00:02:46,007 --> 00:02:50,611
But if you remember the Star Wars atta, it was, you know, it was huge.

47
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:52,292
The guys would barely come past the feet.

48
00:02:52,932 --> 00:02:56,455
So, Scott and I had this extended discussion,

49
00:02:57,536 --> 00:03:01,819
and where I basically said he was wrong and decided to try and prove it.

50
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,302
So I reckon you should try and get him as small as possible,

51
00:03:05,782 --> 00:03:10,266
so that you got this real sense of scale when the Walker decided to just shoot everybody.

52
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:14,390
I initially aimed for 8x8 pixels.

53
00:03:15,271 --> 00:03:17,913
I thought that would be a good size to have it,

54
00:03:18,293 --> 00:03:19,694
so half the size he had.

55
00:03:19,714 --> 00:03:22,836
I did have some inspiration for this.

56
00:03:24,217 --> 00:03:26,039
I was doing Commodore 64 work at the time,

57
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:28,080
and it was a game called Beachhead 2,

58
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:30,502
so you can see the guy there throwing the grenade.

59
00:03:31,483 --> 00:03:32,804
He used to run out from behind the wall,

60
00:03:32,844 --> 00:03:33,985
throw a grenade, run off again.

61
00:03:35,867 --> 00:03:39,789
Commodore 64 was really well known for having nice, smooth animation.

62
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:43,850
And although this guy was much bigger than I actually remembered,

63
00:03:44,971 --> 00:03:47,792
he is actually almost 16x16 on his health,

64
00:03:48,452 --> 00:03:52,954
the animation from it showed that even a small blocky thing

65
00:03:53,314 --> 00:03:55,175
can get some really nice animation out of it.

66
00:03:55,895 --> 00:03:57,596
The other one was OIDS.

67
00:03:58,176 --> 00:04:01,117
Brian had lent me his Atari ST for one summer

68
00:04:01,437 --> 00:04:03,798
while he came to America to do his summer camp.

69
00:04:04,899 --> 00:04:08,339
So, aside from learning 6 to 8,000, I played a stack of games as well.

70
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:09,960
Oiz was one of them.

71
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,361
Oiz has this really cool little guy.

72
00:04:14,381 --> 00:04:15,641
He's about five pixels high.

73
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:20,842
The animation sucked on it, but it was a really small guy that you could run about and shoot.

74
00:04:21,982 --> 00:04:27,143
So I reckon somewhere in the middle, you'd probably get a good character to work with.

75
00:04:28,744 --> 00:04:30,344
That spawned this image.

76
00:04:32,468 --> 00:04:37,591
Now, you can kind of see the guy I did is this spiky-haired,

77
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,113
Mohican, multicolored guy.

78
00:04:41,634 --> 00:04:44,556
Just to the right of the mouth, you can kind of see that I'm

79
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:45,076
walking there.

80
00:04:45,516 --> 00:04:46,917
So I drew him.

81
00:04:46,937 --> 00:04:49,219
He's a little bit bigger than a, I think he's about 10

82
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:49,839
pixels in all.

83
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,021
And because I came from, I'd been playing Oids,

84
00:04:54,922 --> 00:04:56,443
I did this kind of burning down thing,

85
00:04:56,483 --> 00:04:58,804
and then because we're kind of sadistic,

86
00:04:58,824 --> 00:05:00,284
we did it shooting them as well,

87
00:05:01,045 --> 00:05:02,265
and then just drew a whole load of them.

88
00:05:02,786 --> 00:05:04,086
This was all done in Deluxe Paint,

89
00:05:04,306 --> 00:05:05,787
and DeepPaint has this really nice feature

90
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:07,728
where you could pick up an animation

91
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:09,489
and then just draw it across the screen,

92
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:11,370
and it'll just do this lovely animating sequence.

93
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,291
So I drew a ground on it,

94
00:05:13,871 --> 00:05:16,672
drew the gun over a couple of lunch times,

95
00:05:17,813 --> 00:05:18,633
and then showed the guys.

96
00:05:20,414 --> 00:05:23,136
Like most people, they kind of fell about laughing at it,

97
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,237
thinking, this is great.

98
00:05:25,137 --> 00:05:26,198
Russell Kay immediately going,

99
00:05:26,258 --> 00:05:27,619
there's definitely a game in that somewhere.

100
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,801
One thing that did occur to us when we were doing this

101
00:05:30,841 --> 00:05:34,743
was that it's really nice to kill them

102
00:05:35,123 --> 00:05:38,005
and see them get, you know, obliterated in different ways.

103
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:43,601
And it kind of harked back to the Roadrunner, Wile E. Coyote thing,

104
00:05:43,621 --> 00:05:48,903
where you can just think up huge numbers of ways to destroy them.

105
00:05:49,103 --> 00:05:52,245
So I did that 10-ton weight, squishing them,

106
00:05:52,805 --> 00:05:55,327
which, although it looks like it's getting a nice crunching of the bones

107
00:05:55,387 --> 00:05:59,649
as it goes down there, that was actually just because I didn't leave enough space

108
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:02,250
to make it go down evenly, so it was a pure fluke.

109
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,991
But it does really give a nice lemon crunching.

110
00:06:05,992 --> 00:06:06,412
down there.

111
00:06:07,613 --> 00:06:10,215
Gary Timmons then came along and added

112
00:06:11,356 --> 00:06:13,458
the other three, the hands, the spinny rotor,

113
00:06:13,518 --> 00:06:14,458
and the mouth.

114
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:18,641
And just, I mean, there was endless ways you could go about

115
00:06:18,661 --> 00:06:20,243
killing these, and it was clear that

116
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,705
if we could think of a way of putting them in a game,

117
00:06:23,685 --> 00:06:25,827
the whole thing would revolve around them dying somehow,

118
00:06:25,847 --> 00:06:27,949
because that was just the satisfaction of it all.

119
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:33,733
What he also did was he really fine-tuned the animation.

120
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:36,855
The guy I've got is very rigid.

121
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,217
You can kind of see here, mine on the left,

122
00:06:39,457 --> 00:06:40,498
and then Gary's on the right.

123
00:06:41,059 --> 00:06:42,840
It's fundamentally the same guy,

124
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,521
but he added the bouncing hair

125
00:06:44,922 --> 00:06:47,183
and the feet kind of roll really nicely.

126
00:06:48,548 --> 00:06:51,050
And you can kind of see that what he did,

127
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:52,532
although the psychedelic colors again,

128
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,375
is basically the lemming kind of coming to life.

129
00:06:56,957 --> 00:06:58,178
And it's very close to the other one,

130
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:00,560
but it just has that really soft bounce

131
00:07:01,381 --> 00:07:03,423
and nice animation that Lemmings is known for.

132
00:07:05,262 --> 00:07:08,443
Now the colors of the Lemmings was a technical limitation,

133
00:07:08,483 --> 00:07:09,963
like most things were in those days.

134
00:07:10,883 --> 00:07:15,705
Omega and ST could pretty much pick any color they wanted,

135
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:18,326
but we wanted to draw them in just four colors

136
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:19,926
so that they were faster to draw,

137
00:07:19,986 --> 00:07:21,907
because we wanted to have lots of these guys to kill.

138
00:07:24,622 --> 00:07:27,283
On the PC, we had VGA, EGA, and CGA.

139
00:07:27,883 --> 00:07:29,744
Now, VGA, you could pick your colors as well.

140
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,224
CGA was so bad, you just didn't care.

141
00:07:33,364 --> 00:07:34,945
You would just go with whatever worked.

142
00:07:35,525 --> 00:07:36,845
So you were kind of left with EGA.

143
00:07:37,546 --> 00:07:41,126
And we kind of came up with the blue and green.

144
00:07:41,246 --> 00:07:44,467
So we did try flipping the dungarees and the hair.

145
00:07:44,627 --> 00:07:45,988
We had green dungarees and blue hair.

146
00:07:46,728 --> 00:07:48,688
But it just felt this one was just a little bit more

147
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:49,689
aesthetically pleasing.

148
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:52,429
We did resurrect it for the two-player one later on.

149
00:07:54,930 --> 00:08:00,853
Now, Russell Kay did do the first ever demo of Lemmings.

150
00:08:01,213 --> 00:08:06,555
The office actually only opened in August 1989, so you can see this is only a month

151
00:08:06,595 --> 00:08:07,135
or so after.

152
00:08:07,155 --> 00:08:12,458
It was really in the first month that I did the animation, and then about a month later

153
00:08:12,518 --> 00:08:15,419
Russell found time to actually go and try and knock something up.

154
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:22,589
He had a bit of inspiration from this, because he had been having an argument with Dave about

155
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:23,869
missile following.

156
00:08:23,929 --> 00:08:26,731
In Blood Money, you could fire missiles out or rockets and bombs.

157
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:31,152
And initially, they wanted to fire rockets that followed the terrain.

158
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:36,455
So Russell had thought of a way of kind of possibly doing this, similar to what Salamander

159
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:36,675
had.

160
00:08:37,275 --> 00:08:39,496
So he thought, maybe he can use this for the Lemmings as well.

161
00:08:41,997 --> 00:08:45,578
So he created a little demo.

162
00:08:47,544 --> 00:08:49,225
There we go.

163
00:08:49,885 --> 00:08:52,007
And he managed to get the 100 lemmings on there.

164
00:08:52,047 --> 00:08:54,128
Now, it was able to get a bit more,

165
00:08:54,228 --> 00:08:56,669
but the 100 was the kind of number, that gold number

166
00:08:56,709 --> 00:08:57,590
we were kind of aiming for.

167
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:00,351
It gives you a real, you know, fills the screen

168
00:09:00,371 --> 00:09:03,273
with objects, which back then just was unheard of.

169
00:09:04,034 --> 00:09:06,335
I think this was on an 8 megahertz one.

170
00:09:06,355 --> 00:09:07,375
Oh, yeah, there you go.

171
00:09:07,436 --> 00:09:07,976
Getting a thumbs up.

172
00:09:08,496 --> 00:09:11,137
So it was on an 8 megahertz machine, so it was a pretty slow machine,

173
00:09:11,157 --> 00:09:14,577
but he was still able to draw all 100 lemmings in the two frames.

174
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:18,298
Lemmings actually ran in three, so it gave a bit more time for it.

175
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:21,919
Now, one of the things to note about these when they're walking

176
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:25,039
is the feet stick perfectly to the ground.

177
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:28,100
Even today, you don't really get that.

178
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,740
You know, characters tend to slide about.

179
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,121
I think Gary made a really nice animation

180
00:09:34,221 --> 00:09:37,462
and just made sure that everything was absolutely bang on for walking.

181
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:44,426
So you can see here with the lemmings down the one side,

182
00:09:45,006 --> 00:09:47,969
basically what happens is the feet would move one pixel

183
00:09:48,349 --> 00:09:50,411
to the left each time, because lemmings

184
00:09:50,451 --> 00:09:51,472
move one pixel at a time.

185
00:09:51,832 --> 00:09:53,453
And that gave it that kind of solidity

186
00:09:53,474 --> 00:09:56,256
to put it into the world, just absolutely perfect.

187
00:09:56,276 --> 00:09:58,298
So when they land on the ground, because it was usually

188
00:09:58,358 --> 00:10:00,620
flat they were walking over, you could really

189
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,061
see the feet just sticking.

190
00:10:02,141 --> 00:10:03,482
And it put them right into the world.

191
00:10:04,363 --> 00:10:07,445
And he really did make just a great job of doing that.

192
00:10:10,181 --> 00:10:14,205
Now the levels themselves were basically just gigantic bitmaps.

193
00:10:14,705 --> 00:10:19,009
They were 1600 by 160, basically five Amiga screens wide.

194
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:25,815
And although the special levels, the Menace, Shadow of the Beast levels,

195
00:10:26,355 --> 00:10:31,880
were stored as bitmaps on disk, we obviously had severely limited disk space back then.

196
00:10:33,117 --> 00:10:35,660
So they were all done effectively as little brushes.

197
00:10:36,101 --> 00:10:38,163
So each metal block would be a brush

198
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:39,845
that you would place in the level,

199
00:10:40,145 --> 00:10:41,267
and you could go and delete it again,

200
00:10:41,327 --> 00:10:42,508
or you could edit it, or whatever.

201
00:10:42,528 --> 00:10:46,092
It was all kind of modeled on Deluxe Paint's editing.

202
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:52,577
The levels themselves, we kind of just came up with different ways of doing it,

203
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:56,161
for the design of them, how we were going to approach it.

204
00:10:56,361 --> 00:10:57,262
We'll get to that in a second.

205
00:10:57,743 --> 00:11:01,967
The special levels had an extra difficulty in that,

206
00:11:02,027 --> 00:11:03,289
because of the color selection,

207
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:06,792
I couldn't use any traps. I did all the different special levels.

208
00:11:07,373 --> 00:11:12,057
So basically I just had to work with a way of getting the lemming from start to stop

209
00:11:12,178 --> 00:11:14,400
using builders and bashers.

210
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,463
So it did complicate making those levels and making them any good.

211
00:11:18,564 --> 00:11:20,786
They were never quite as good as all the other ones,

212
00:11:21,707 --> 00:11:23,869
but it was nice to see these throughout the different stages.

213
00:11:25,568 --> 00:11:29,797
The art gallery one is interesting because that influenced how the game was going to look.

214
00:11:30,158 --> 00:11:34,507
It was the first level that really kind of became a picture rather than just a few blocks.

215
00:11:35,148 --> 00:11:36,772
And again, I'll talk about that in a second.

216
00:11:38,187 --> 00:11:39,408
These are some of the levels I did.

217
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,412
So when picking how to do a level

218
00:11:44,452 --> 00:11:45,753
and what level I was going to create,

219
00:11:47,154 --> 00:11:50,657
I either came up with a really nice idea for, oh, I

220
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:53,859
could fuck somebody with this, or they'll never guess this one.

221
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,961
Or I would basically try and make a picture.

222
00:11:56,481 --> 00:11:58,703
So in the game, there was a little mini map at the bottom

223
00:11:58,723 --> 00:12:02,166
that was basically a monocolored outline of what the level was.

224
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:05,930
And that was really for fast scrolling,

225
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,370
because you just had the mouse,

226
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,871
so touching the edge of the screen would take a long time

227
00:12:10,211 --> 00:12:12,152
to scroll to the other end of the five screens.

228
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:13,793
So you could click on that and drag it.

229
00:12:15,614 --> 00:12:17,915
But I like to kind of try and show

230
00:12:18,055 --> 00:12:19,276
little pictures in there if I could.

231
00:12:19,856 --> 00:12:22,477
So the top one's the hunt and essay that I drew,

232
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,738
and then figured out a level to put across it.

233
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,360
And then the second one was just the shipwreck that I did,

234
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,641
but a similar thing, so that in the little mini-map,

235
00:12:30,721 --> 00:12:31,882
it looked like a little shipwreck.

236
00:12:33,334 --> 00:12:36,976
I also really like making the player do lots of things at the same time.

237
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:42,319
So the fast food kitchen one there, the lemmings drop out two places at once and you have to

238
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:49,802
get them both up to the exit in a reasonable amount of time, usually with ridiculously

239
00:12:49,842 --> 00:12:53,524
difficult targets to achieve without losing any lemmings.

240
00:12:56,105 --> 00:12:59,927
One of the other, my other favourite ones was It's Hero Time, which...

241
00:13:01,367 --> 00:13:06,792
was basically a thought of getting a level where you would use one lemming and the other

242
00:13:06,832 --> 00:13:10,776
lemmings would all kind of just go their own way and you couldn't really stop them, they

243
00:13:10,796 --> 00:13:14,620
were just kind of marching on, but you had to get this other one to run ahead of them

244
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,380
and fix things.

245
00:13:16,081 --> 00:13:20,302
I took great satisfaction in the fact that when we sent it down to Psygnosis, we'd usually

246
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:24,823
get a fax back with, this one took five minutes, this one took three minutes, and little comments,

247
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,003
oh, this wasn't too bad.

248
00:13:27,103 --> 00:13:30,244
And that one came back with scribbles all over the page, cursing and swearing at it,

249
00:13:30,504 --> 00:13:31,884
and it took them about an hour and a half.

250
00:13:32,524 --> 00:13:34,145
So I was quite pleased with that one.

251
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,186
The bottom one, the 666, was my fault as well.

252
00:13:40,849 --> 00:13:43,272
didn't appear in very many ports of the game.

253
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,613
It tended to get removed.

254
00:13:44,633 --> 00:13:45,995
I can't think why.

255
00:13:46,015 --> 00:13:49,779
It actually started out because I was trying to get 55

256
00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:51,321
of everything.

257
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:54,544
So 55 bombers, 55 release rate, and so on.

258
00:13:54,864 --> 00:13:56,826
But I couldn't get the numbers to quite match up.

259
00:13:57,888 --> 00:14:00,370
And I just discovered if I did 66, it all kind of worked.

260
00:14:01,231 --> 00:14:04,953
I happened to be doing the level in the Fire and Brimstone style,

261
00:14:05,434 --> 00:14:06,534
and you just immediately think,

262
00:14:06,574 --> 00:14:09,056
that's hell, 666, that sounds like a good idea.

263
00:14:09,796 --> 00:14:10,517
Turns out it wasn't.

264
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:15,960
Now, when Gary did levels,

265
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,483
he just did incredibly simplistic-looking levels,

266
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:23,385
but they were fiendishly difficult.

267
00:14:23,885 --> 00:14:26,287
So you can see here the levels kind of extracted

268
00:14:27,407 --> 00:14:28,468
from the fluff around it.

269
00:14:29,549 --> 00:14:31,630
Now that's usually what he gave to us to solve,

270
00:14:31,951 --> 00:14:33,692
it's just this very bare bones level.

271
00:14:34,693 --> 00:14:36,435
They were incredibly difficult,

272
00:14:37,696 --> 00:14:40,859
but it was after seeing the art gallery one

273
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:42,080
that Dave kind of looked at them and went,

274
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,142
yeah, nobody's going to pay for that, are they?

275
00:14:44,222 --> 00:14:47,565
So he ordered Gary to go and make the levels prettier.

276
00:14:47,885 --> 00:14:50,087
But you can see all he did was just put all these things

277
00:14:50,147 --> 00:14:52,730
around the base level that didn't interfere

278
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:53,510
in any kind of way.

279
00:14:55,057 --> 00:14:56,858
Now, the levels when we were doing them,

280
00:14:58,338 --> 00:14:59,698
by the time we got to this stage,

281
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:03,079
we were all utter experts at making and solving levels.

282
00:15:03,619 --> 00:15:06,980
So we ended up basically trying to come up with levels

283
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,581
that would beat ourselves.

284
00:15:09,481 --> 00:15:11,281
And they'd be incredibly tough levels,

285
00:15:11,401 --> 00:15:13,802
but we'd still solve them in a couple of minutes

286
00:15:13,842 --> 00:15:14,942
without any problems at all.

287
00:15:16,175 --> 00:15:21,318
What that meant was we had 20, 30 incredibly hard levels

288
00:15:21,818 --> 00:15:23,379
that nobody else would be able to solve.

289
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:26,741
So the first thing Dave got Gary to do

290
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,242
was to take all these levels

291
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:30,063
and just make simpler versions of them.

292
00:15:31,355 --> 00:15:34,718
That only really involved adding maybe a couple of skills.

293
00:15:35,078 --> 00:15:37,960
So if we gave you one builder and you had to get it right on the nail,

294
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,022
then you might give them two builders and maybe a blocker

295
00:15:41,082 --> 00:15:44,144
and take the number you have to say just down a smidge.

296
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,166
And that just simplified things an awful lot.

297
00:15:47,206 --> 00:15:48,527
So the levels could appear twice.

298
00:15:50,063 --> 00:15:53,546
You then got Gary to go and make basically introductionary levels.

299
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,787
Things like Just Dig, where all you had was diggers,

300
00:15:56,508 --> 00:15:59,770
and it was pretty straightforward to kind of figure out what you had to do.

301
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:03,592
And it's probably one of the first games that really had a tutorial in it,

302
00:16:03,832 --> 00:16:05,874
although we didn't have big hands pointing and texting,

303
00:16:06,334 --> 00:16:07,134
do X, Y, and Z.

304
00:16:07,355 --> 00:16:08,716
It was all quite self-explanatory.

305
00:16:09,648 --> 00:16:14,490
But once Gary put these in and he then set about making a nice difficulty curve,

306
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:17,731
it's probably the thing that really made Lemmings the hit it was,

307
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,532
because everybody could get into it at some point.

308
00:16:20,912 --> 00:16:24,753
We've heard from five-year-olds that got up to like level seven and really enjoyed it,

309
00:16:25,534 --> 00:16:27,514
older folk that were able to get past the first stage,

310
00:16:27,734 --> 00:16:29,475
and entire families being able to play it,

311
00:16:30,035 --> 00:16:34,037
pretty much because the difficulty level was such that everybody could play it.

312
00:16:35,097 --> 00:16:38,638
And that was down to Gary really just fine-tuning that level.

313
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,778
Okay, so, Lemmings Editor.

314
00:16:48,158 --> 00:16:51,721
I did manage to resurrect my 20 or 30 year old disc.

315
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:54,362
I don't think it'll work anymore,

316
00:16:54,422 --> 00:16:55,923
but I've got some video, so hey-ho.

317
00:16:57,344 --> 00:17:01,427
Now, what made this unique, particularly for the time,

318
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,209
was the Lemmings Editor was built right into the game.

319
00:17:05,749 --> 00:17:07,270
For the games we'd done up to this point,

320
00:17:07,731 --> 00:17:09,112
we had a separate level editor.

321
00:17:09,552 --> 00:17:10,993
You'd design it, you'd save it off,

322
00:17:11,173 --> 00:17:12,774
you'd copy it over to the game, you'd run it,

323
00:17:12,814 --> 00:17:14,375
you'd go, that didn't work, and you'd go back again.

324
00:17:15,115 --> 00:17:18,399
This obviously doesn't work for Lemmings because you have to fine-tune to pixels.

325
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,463
So you would just hit escape on this, you go into the editor, you make your change,

326
00:17:22,964 --> 00:17:25,146
hit escape again, and you get back into the game.

327
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:30,651
And this lets you just fine-tune everything just that little bit to make it just a perfect level.

328
00:17:32,174 --> 00:17:34,916
So as you can see there, it's holding a kind of brush

329
00:17:34,936 --> 00:17:37,559
that I could put down and paste in.

330
00:17:38,159 --> 00:17:39,380
And that's kind of where Depaint is.

331
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,763
You pick up an area in Depaint or Deluxe Paint,

332
00:17:43,284 --> 00:17:44,585
and then you could just draw with it.

333
00:17:44,845 --> 00:17:46,126
And we kind of modeled it on that.

334
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:49,309
This is the Hero Time one that I was talking about before.

335
00:17:49,889 --> 00:17:51,030
You just get that march of them.

336
00:17:51,711 --> 00:17:52,892
And again, you just go in and out.

337
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,054
This level would have been a nightmare to make

338
00:17:55,394 --> 00:17:56,835
if I couldn't just hop in and out of the level.

339
00:17:58,067 --> 00:18:01,067
Now, you've got 512 of these brushes

340
00:18:01,107 --> 00:18:02,948
that you could put down anywhere in the level.

341
00:18:05,588 --> 00:18:08,369
But it did mean that if you wanted

342
00:18:08,409 --> 00:18:10,609
to delete one that was in the middle of the level,

343
00:18:11,109 --> 00:18:12,770
you had to go into a special edit mode

344
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,910
and then just hit Enter to go through every single block

345
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:18,091
till you got to the one you wanted, press Delete,

346
00:18:18,391 --> 00:18:19,311
and then carry on again.

347
00:18:20,651 --> 00:18:22,091
But we thought it was still pretty good,

348
00:18:22,111 --> 00:18:23,172
because Deep Ink couldn't do that.

349
00:18:23,212 --> 00:18:24,892
We were just used to bitmaps, basically.

350
00:18:26,622 --> 00:18:30,025
So here I'm kind of putting down blocks very wobbly.

351
00:18:30,425 --> 00:18:34,868
Turns out that you really do need mice mats for ball mice,

352
00:18:34,908 --> 00:18:37,790
and I don't have one anymore.

353
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,291
But you can see I put down the blocks,

354
00:18:39,311 --> 00:18:40,452
and I can go and delete them again.

355
00:18:40,492 --> 00:18:43,734
I've decided that's not what I want.

356
00:18:44,815 --> 00:18:47,097
The actual editing of it, there's

357
00:18:47,177 --> 00:18:48,758
different ways you can put down a block.

358
00:18:48,938 --> 00:18:50,860
You can either just paint it down on top of everything else,

359
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,842
or you can kind of go into a behind mode,

360
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,303
so the block will draw behind things.

361
00:18:56,758 --> 00:19:00,600
Or you can take it so it's a mask and you can cut areas away.

362
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,462
The lemmings themselves just walk on whatever

363
00:19:04,182 --> 00:19:04,902
is in the level.

364
00:19:05,222 --> 00:19:06,963
You'll notice that in Lemmings 1,

365
00:19:07,164 --> 00:19:09,065
it's just a plain background.

366
00:19:09,085 --> 00:19:10,225
There's nothing for them to walk over.

367
00:19:10,545 --> 00:19:12,026
So any place where there's a pixel,

368
00:19:12,326 --> 00:19:13,147
that's what they walk on.

369
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:17,149
So here you can see I'm going to get a brush

370
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,671
and then I can put it behind the background

371
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:22,732
and I could draw in there if I wanted.

372
00:19:24,942 --> 00:19:26,843
or I can make it a mask,

373
00:19:27,383 --> 00:19:29,524
and then that becomes an area I can cut away.

374
00:19:31,385 --> 00:19:33,706
And then when you play, it just becomes a big bitmap again,

375
00:19:33,726 --> 00:19:35,486
and then the lemmings just walk over that.

376
00:19:38,348 --> 00:19:40,268
So making a level was really just about

377
00:19:40,308 --> 00:19:42,229
trying to get this big bitmap that they can walk over.

378
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,311
That was a level that wasn't used,

379
00:19:46,331 --> 00:19:47,291
because it was crap.

380
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:54,097
You can see there as well the little green mask that I like to draw pictures in.

381
00:19:54,638 --> 00:19:55,358
That was quite good fun.

382
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,141
Objects as well could go inside the actual background that we used for the arrows.

383
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:05,365
But again, that was just on any pixel that happened to be there.

384
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:10,308
So here again you can see going through, picking some kind of brush,

385
00:20:10,868 --> 00:20:12,850
and then I can use that to take away the background.

386
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:15,890
And then when the lemmings start,

387
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,410
they can just follow through and walk

388
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,391
through the newly created bitmap.

389
00:20:25,652 --> 00:20:26,672
Now depending on what you want,

390
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:27,812
you might want it to be smoother,

391
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:28,812
you might want it to be hard drop.

392
00:20:29,193 --> 00:20:30,533
Again, you just get the brushes

393
00:20:30,593 --> 00:20:31,773
and then you can just scribble in

394
00:20:32,393 --> 00:20:33,733
whatever you wanted on these things.

395
00:20:34,774 --> 00:20:36,494
There you can see the arrows obviously come through

396
00:20:36,534 --> 00:20:37,914
because it's got more pixels to go on.

397
00:20:38,234 --> 00:20:40,195
It just used the background as a mask to draw into.

398
00:20:42,493 --> 00:20:43,494
and then that just walks through.

399
00:20:43,514 --> 00:20:46,234
So you can see, being able to go in and out of the level

400
00:20:46,534 --> 00:20:50,355
just at random to fine tune that little bit

401
00:20:50,715 --> 00:20:52,195
is incredibly important to Lemmings

402
00:20:52,975 --> 00:20:55,396
because that's where you really just adjust things

403
00:20:55,436 --> 00:20:56,876
just to be just right.

404
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:03,377
So I will talk about objects and the collision

405
00:21:03,537 --> 00:21:05,037
because I couldn't find the keys in the editor.

406
00:21:06,118 --> 00:21:07,278
We didn't have manuals back then,

407
00:21:07,358 --> 00:21:08,838
so I have no idea what the keys were.

408
00:21:10,977 --> 00:21:19,203
Because it was just a big bitmap, the actual collision for things like metal were kind of fudged in.

409
00:21:20,244 --> 00:21:26,708
Basically what you do is go in and mark rectangular areas and say, this is solid.

410
00:21:27,349 --> 00:21:29,930
So you can see here, there's several of these over the top of things.

411
00:21:31,011 --> 00:21:33,072
It doesn't discriminate between metal or anything else.

412
00:21:33,473 --> 00:21:38,176
So you can see as well, at the far right, it goes over some of the ground.

413
00:21:38,396 --> 00:21:39,677
That's marked as solid as well.

414
00:21:40,777 --> 00:21:43,878
But it's also pretty crap.

415
00:21:44,438 --> 00:21:46,920
If it fits perfectly, so when a lemming walks,

416
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,661
the collision is just under his feet.

417
00:21:48,701 --> 00:21:50,181
So you'd be one pixel into the ground.

418
00:21:50,662 --> 00:21:53,623
So as he walked over the metal, if you did a bomber

419
00:21:53,663 --> 00:21:55,544
and tried to explode it, look at that pixel and go,

420
00:21:55,704 --> 00:21:56,745
oh, I mean, I'm in solid.

421
00:21:57,205 --> 00:21:58,506
I won't actually take any background away.

422
00:21:58,946 --> 00:22:00,106
And that all was good with the world.

423
00:22:01,047 --> 00:22:03,028
But if you happen to have a builder

424
00:22:03,068 --> 00:22:04,829
and built a few pixels above the collision

425
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:06,310
and then did a bomber.

426
00:22:06,888 --> 00:22:08,069
it'd be checking the collision and going,

427
00:22:08,109 --> 00:22:08,930
no, that's not right,

428
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:11,431
and it would just take big chunks out of the metal.

429
00:22:12,011 --> 00:22:13,452
It's probably the biggest failing

430
00:22:13,492 --> 00:22:16,113
in the original Lemmings mechanic.

431
00:22:16,474 --> 00:22:17,814
But we just kind of designed around that.

432
00:22:18,114 --> 00:22:20,976
Occasionally, if we thought a player could cheat

433
00:22:21,096 --> 00:22:22,177
and get through, you'll see here,

434
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:24,898
there's little borders sometimes that we just extend it

435
00:22:24,938 --> 00:22:26,899
just to make sure they can't kind of cheat

436
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:28,440
the way around it, if it really matters.

437
00:22:29,861 --> 00:22:31,441
And you could put down lots of these rectangles

438
00:22:31,662 --> 00:22:32,302
wherever you needed.

439
00:22:33,365 --> 00:22:36,146
The objects themselves, you got 32 objects.

440
00:22:36,406 --> 00:22:38,306
You obviously had to have your entry and exit points.

441
00:22:38,747 --> 00:22:41,447
So here I've got four entry points and the exit.

442
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:44,608
Again, I love to make players do lots of things at once

443
00:22:44,628 --> 00:22:45,488
because it drove them mad.

444
00:22:47,088 --> 00:22:50,109
The rest of it you tended to use either for traps

445
00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:52,430
that you would hide away sometimes underneath other things

446
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:56,011
so they just didn't see them, or you'd use it for fluff.

447
00:22:56,131 --> 00:22:59,711
Water was used just for decoration all over the place.

448
00:22:59,931 --> 00:23:01,072
It was a really nice animation.

449
00:23:01,112 --> 00:23:02,292
You could just fill the level with it

450
00:23:02,332 --> 00:23:03,192
to give it a bit of movement.

451
00:23:07,112 --> 00:23:10,075
So the front end was going to be very different.

452
00:23:10,696 --> 00:23:15,180
Dave initially wanted to basically have the front end just

453
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:21,405
covered in lemmings and have messages come up by them

454
00:23:21,646 --> 00:23:23,167
having them hold up little cards.

455
00:23:24,885 --> 00:23:26,826
So he got me to do a prototype,

456
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:29,046
and I went and drew a stack of lemmings,

457
00:23:30,227 --> 00:23:31,287
and then covered the screen,

458
00:23:31,467 --> 00:23:34,329
so it was 320, 200 screen, in these lemmings.

459
00:23:35,589 --> 00:23:37,210
And aside from looking really cool,

460
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:39,691
it was totally bizarre.

461
00:23:40,851 --> 00:23:42,632
You just couldn't follow what was going on.

462
00:23:43,372 --> 00:23:45,533
So that was dropped, which was a shame,

463
00:23:45,553 --> 00:23:48,034
because you can kind of see the lemmings are a nice character,

464
00:23:48,054 --> 00:23:49,675
you can literally do anything with it,

465
00:23:49,735 --> 00:23:51,216
and it just feels kind of right.

466
00:23:52,801 --> 00:23:54,842
But it was just far too confusing.

467
00:23:55,582 --> 00:23:58,603
So we went with the more traditional front end,

468
00:23:59,024 --> 00:23:59,684
which is a bit of a shame.

469
00:24:02,385 --> 00:24:02,805
Explosion.

470
00:24:03,685 --> 00:24:06,366
Now I suspect, like us, when you first saw this,

471
00:24:06,406 --> 00:24:07,207
you thought it was quite funny.

472
00:24:09,486 --> 00:24:12,267
No more so than Brian who did fall off his chair laughing.

473
00:24:12,727 --> 00:24:15,088
As shown in this dramatic reconstruction.

474
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:21,631
And aside from laughing at Brian, which is always a good thing to do, it solved a number

475
00:24:21,651 --> 00:24:22,131
of things.

476
00:24:22,611 --> 00:24:24,672
You know, the level had to be finished somehow.

477
00:24:24,692 --> 00:24:27,193
If you got stuck in a level, you had to abort it.

478
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:30,534
And it goes back to the initial thing of we really like killing these guys.

479
00:24:31,334 --> 00:24:34,316
So a way of killing them all off is a good thing.

480
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,920
The actual pixel explosion came because Dave loved Defender.

481
00:24:39,601 --> 00:24:42,663
So he really decided that I want that explosion.

482
00:24:42,883 --> 00:24:45,245
I've been asked several times whether it's a particle system

483
00:24:45,365 --> 00:24:46,266
or a big sprite.

484
00:24:47,026 --> 00:24:50,369
It's basically a point cloud animation.

485
00:24:50,729 --> 00:24:52,771
So it's basically a list of positions

486
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:55,533
that are offset from an origin and then just frames of it.

487
00:24:55,873 --> 00:24:57,855
And it was drawn by Gary to make it look pretty.

488
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:02,001
I mean, it was just super satisfying just nuking them all the time.

489
00:25:02,861 --> 00:25:04,582
Sometimes, even when you were going to finish the level,

490
00:25:04,622 --> 00:25:06,003
you didn't care, you just had to do it.

491
00:25:08,285 --> 00:25:11,747
Now, I do want to just comment on the graphics.

492
00:25:12,327 --> 00:25:14,149
These days, obviously, when you do graphics

493
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:16,190
and you port it to another system,

494
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,972
they're all 16-bit, 32-bit graphics,

495
00:25:19,012 --> 00:25:20,173
they just kind of go across.

496
00:25:20,433 --> 00:25:21,653
You might have to resize them a bit,

497
00:25:22,434 --> 00:25:23,215
but that's about it.

498
00:25:24,195 --> 00:25:27,217
Back in the day, you didn't have the luxury.

499
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:30,291
you literally had to redraw everything.

500
00:25:31,232 --> 00:25:34,435
So you can see the different variety there.

501
00:25:34,775 --> 00:25:37,317
Different screen sizes, different color depths,

502
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:38,739
different colors.

503
00:25:39,219 --> 00:25:40,840
The second column ends, the PC one,

504
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,882
so you've got VGA, EGA, and CGA.

505
00:25:43,403 --> 00:25:44,424
Steve Hammond did all those.

506
00:25:45,184 --> 00:25:46,645
And you can see what I mean by CGA.

507
00:25:46,806 --> 00:25:47,866
It's just awful.

508
00:25:47,886 --> 00:25:49,988
You know, the color selection just...

509
00:25:50,769 --> 00:25:51,810
you just kind of make best.

510
00:25:53,247 --> 00:26:00,900
The EJ one is luminous and crap, so really you need that Omega VG kind of look.

511
00:26:02,514 --> 00:26:05,855
Some of the black and white ones, I've got massive respect for them,

512
00:26:05,915 --> 00:26:09,196
because if you think about it, particularly in the game,

513
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:11,816
you need the shading to give some definition.

514
00:26:12,677 --> 00:26:15,277
But in Spectrum and the Game Boy one,

515
00:26:16,138 --> 00:26:19,758
you'll need to kind of do dithering to see, you know, that's a shadow and so on.

516
00:26:20,199 --> 00:26:22,059
But at the same time, you've got to walk over this,

517
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:26,060
which meant that you'll be walking over a mask that has no pixels in it.

518
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,001
So it kind of differs from the main game

519
00:26:28,601 --> 00:26:30,741
in that there could be something that looks totally empty,

520
00:26:30,781 --> 00:26:32,042
but you'll only just going to turn around then.

521
00:26:32,905 --> 00:26:34,605
And that was just a limitation of the system.

522
00:26:34,645 --> 00:26:37,407
You couldn't make everything just solid white or not.

523
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:38,587
It just looked awful.

524
00:26:40,248 --> 00:26:42,729
Some of the other ones, the Atari Lynx one,

525
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:44,429
was a tiny little screen.

526
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:47,671
We ended up having to do the panel again,

527
00:26:47,951 --> 00:26:48,731
and it just filled the screen

528
00:26:48,751 --> 00:26:50,032
because we didn't have the space for it.

529
00:26:51,252 --> 00:26:54,253
And the Sega versions and the Nintendo versions,

530
00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:56,620
and specifically the Game Boy one,

531
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,582
we had huge respect for trying to get that

532
00:26:59,782 --> 00:27:01,843
five-screen bitmap into that limited memory.

533
00:27:02,284 --> 00:27:03,805
It was incredibly well done.

534
00:27:06,607 --> 00:27:07,468
Two-player Lemmings.

535
00:27:07,828 --> 00:27:10,630
So this kind of came about because

536
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:13,892
we love playing the two-player games.

537
00:27:16,361 --> 00:27:18,902
Specifically, we used to play Populous and Stunt Car Racer.

538
00:27:19,903 --> 00:27:22,764
Because we had two rooms separated by a hallway,

539
00:27:23,124 --> 00:27:25,505
we'd put an Amiga in each room, and then a null modem cable

540
00:27:25,525 --> 00:27:26,246
would run between them.

541
00:27:27,286 --> 00:27:29,127
And then Dave would thrash the life out of us

542
00:27:29,587 --> 00:27:31,728
from whatever game he chose.

543
00:27:32,369 --> 00:27:35,790
But the two-player game, it was something

544
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:38,051
that was just quite new for Amigas at the time.

545
00:27:39,373 --> 00:27:42,016
So Dave got me to basically get an all modem cable,

546
00:27:42,576 --> 00:27:44,177
connect up and then write a driver

547
00:27:44,217 --> 00:27:45,758
for controlling a mouse on a different screen,

548
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:49,221
which I did and I was able to move my mouse on my Amiga

549
00:27:49,281 --> 00:27:50,062
and it moved on his.

550
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,522
But he kind of decided at the end that, you know,

551
00:27:54,922 --> 00:27:56,883
not everybody can cart their Amiga and TV

552
00:27:56,903 --> 00:27:57,704
around to their pals.

553
00:27:58,264 --> 00:28:00,966
So he went with a kind of more, that split screen thing.

554
00:28:01,226 --> 00:28:03,568
The big bit down the middle is just to hide the blip

555
00:28:03,668 --> 00:28:05,149
because he couldn't be bothered doing it properly.

556
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:08,972
You'll see the green and blue haired lemmings

557
00:28:08,992 --> 00:28:11,093
kind of come back again for the two player one.

558
00:28:11,854 --> 00:28:12,554
It's interesting though,

559
00:28:12,574 --> 00:28:14,736
because even though you're right next to it,

560
00:28:15,688 --> 00:28:17,349
and you can see what the other player's doing,

561
00:28:17,749 --> 00:28:19,550
you never actually paid much attention

562
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,230
to what they were doing.

563
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:21,631
You would always be concentrating

564
00:28:21,671 --> 00:28:25,393
on your pixel perfect clicking for your lemming,

565
00:28:25,733 --> 00:28:28,514
and then wonder why the screaming going on in the corner

566
00:28:28,634 --> 00:28:29,935
because all your lemmings are dying,

567
00:28:29,955 --> 00:28:33,216
and it's because the other bugger sent a lemming over

568
00:28:33,256 --> 00:28:34,937
and dug straight down past your exit,

569
00:28:35,317 --> 00:28:37,658
and you didn't notice.

570
00:28:37,678 --> 00:28:39,679
So it was a really good two-player game,

571
00:28:39,699 --> 00:28:41,099
and it's one that's, I'm kind of sad,

572
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,180
that's never really been brought forward.

573
00:28:45,614 --> 00:28:48,356
It did appear on the Amiga and ST versions,

574
00:28:48,396 --> 00:28:49,777
but the PC one couldn't do it.

575
00:28:50,197 --> 00:28:53,399
Back in those days, it was all mouse drivers,

576
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,941
and they just didn't allow you to have two mice

577
00:28:55,981 --> 00:28:58,383
plugged in at the same time, so it just couldn't do it.

578
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:03,446
I was told a story as well that the Data East guy

579
00:29:03,566 --> 00:29:06,709
that commissioned the arcade version of Lemmings,

580
00:29:06,969 --> 00:29:09,671
which didn't actually come out, but he did commission it,

581
00:29:09,851 --> 00:29:11,832
wouldn't finish a meeting without challenging you

582
00:29:11,852 --> 00:29:12,653
to a two-player game.

583
00:29:15,498 --> 00:29:17,460
So that was the end screen of Lemmings.

584
00:29:19,482 --> 00:29:21,224
We did start a little revolution back then.

585
00:29:21,444 --> 00:29:22,825
There was a few Amiga games came out

586
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:23,786
with all the devs around it.

587
00:29:24,467 --> 00:29:26,169
I do think it's quite nice to see,

588
00:29:26,189 --> 00:29:30,934
because the actual team tends to get hidden a bit these days.

589
00:29:31,134 --> 00:29:32,796
You'll tend to get the designer or the producer

590
00:29:32,836 --> 00:29:33,717
being the front man to it.

591
00:29:34,037 --> 00:29:36,499
So I think being able to put faces to people I think is quite nice.

592
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,721
No matter how thick the design document is,

593
00:29:39,562 --> 00:29:41,804
every developer, be it artist or programmer,

594
00:29:42,145 --> 00:29:44,727
has put their own little bit in it to make the game better.

595
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:48,050
And I think it would be nice to see more of them.

596
00:29:49,211 --> 00:29:50,172
This screen came about...

597
00:29:50,192 --> 00:29:52,214
I really don't need to...

598
00:29:54,855 --> 00:29:57,578
This screen came about because we were looking for an ending,

599
00:29:57,618 --> 00:29:59,539
and the endings we'd done before were rubbish.

600
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,161
So I'd been drawing the lemming in the middle

601
00:30:02,202 --> 00:30:05,104
from some of the Psygnosis PR material that we got.

602
00:30:05,124 --> 00:30:06,185
And the stuff that goes to shops,

603
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:07,286
we got a stack of free stuff.

604
00:30:07,646 --> 00:30:08,987
So I'd just been doodling and deep painting.

605
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:11,789
I'd been doing lots of cartoon art.

606
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:14,111
And Dave came up with the idea of,

607
00:30:14,131 --> 00:30:16,333
you know, we could just hover around them there.

608
00:30:17,454 --> 00:30:19,515
and get it. We had an Amiga Genlock at the time.

609
00:30:20,016 --> 00:30:23,798
So we all just kind of posed in funny poses, and then Gary Timmons went and

610
00:30:24,078 --> 00:30:28,801
collated it all together. Interestingly, this has got my only

611
00:30:29,582 --> 00:30:32,404
initial in the game because Dave didn't put my name in the game.

612
00:30:32,744 --> 00:30:37,287
Not that I'm bitter or anything, but yeah, there's a wee MD at the bottom. I

613
00:30:37,307 --> 00:30:40,949
don't know if you can see it there. So that's my only claim of fame in there.

614
00:30:41,229 --> 00:30:44,231
But it was a nice end screen, and I think we all cheered as well at the

615
00:30:44,271 --> 00:30:45,992
end of it, which was slightly pathetic.

616
00:30:48,495 --> 00:30:49,616
So, Lemmings 2.

617
00:30:49,676 --> 00:30:53,198
Now, this will be mainly Super Nintendo,

618
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:54,599
but we'll go through a wee bit.

619
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:58,962
One of the big things in Lemmings 2

620
00:30:59,002 --> 00:31:01,524
was obviously the addition of the skills.

621
00:31:02,344 --> 00:31:03,986
There were way too many skills added.

622
00:31:04,566 --> 00:31:07,688
The original Lemmings 1 had a really nice set of skills,

623
00:31:08,248 --> 00:31:10,770
and a few of the new ones in Lemmings 2 were pretty good.

624
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:13,452
The Ballooner, the Superman.

625
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:18,183
and the Archer, even though the Archer code was awful,

626
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,485
it was a really nice skill to have.

627
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:22,946
Some of the other ones, like the Pole Vaulter,

628
00:31:23,447 --> 00:31:25,528
and the Magna Brut, it was really nice,

629
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:27,810
but semi-pointless, really.

630
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:30,471
Hand Glider and stuff were just silly.

631
00:31:31,812 --> 00:31:32,933
So there was way too many.

632
00:31:32,973 --> 00:31:34,414
I think you could have doubled the skills

633
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:37,156
that we had before, and still maintained

634
00:31:37,176 --> 00:31:39,237
a really nice kind of balance with it.

635
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:43,572
But David thought that, you know, we had hardly any skills.

636
00:31:43,832 --> 00:31:45,013
Let's put loads and loads into it.

637
00:31:45,974 --> 00:31:48,155
In the end, we ended up having to go back through levels

638
00:31:48,215 --> 00:31:50,697
and adding skills that just weren't used in any of the levels

639
00:31:50,897 --> 00:31:51,918
because there were so many of them.

640
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:56,481
Now, the Lemmings editor for Lemmings 2,

641
00:31:56,942 --> 00:31:59,824
we did actually have a manual written by Steve Hammond

642
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:01,405
with his usual flair.

643
00:32:03,386 --> 00:32:06,829
And these are taken from the manual

644
00:32:06,849 --> 00:32:09,030
because I forgot all about these, so it was quite handy.

645
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:16,496
Again, one of the big additions I think that really added to the game was having vertical

646
00:32:16,536 --> 00:32:16,917
levels.

647
00:32:17,638 --> 00:32:21,722
In Lemmings 1 it was obviously just horizontal, but being able to have that kind of building

648
00:32:21,762 --> 00:32:26,287
up vertical or square I think was a big addition and helped a lot.

649
00:32:29,943 --> 00:32:34,245
These were basically the sizes that fit in exactly the same memory pool.

650
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:38,086
I think we had about a K and a half of the tile map,

651
00:32:38,106 --> 00:32:39,787
because we moved from bitmaps to tile maps.

652
00:32:40,507 --> 00:32:43,508
And these different orientations used exactly the same amount of memory,

653
00:32:43,808 --> 00:32:47,170
so we could just change the orientation without having anything fancy.

654
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:50,291
Linux 2 had a...

655
00:32:52,344 --> 00:32:57,086
a big change in technology because we did notice specifically from the Game Boy version

656
00:32:57,106 --> 00:33:03,089
and the Mega Drive and SNES that they were having to try and fight against this big bitmap

657
00:33:03,109 --> 00:33:05,351
system and they just didn't have the memory for it.

658
00:33:06,471 --> 00:33:11,333
So we made a conscious choice to basically do tile maps

659
00:33:11,473 --> 00:33:15,995
even on machines like the Amiga and ST and PC

660
00:33:16,535 --> 00:33:17,916
so that the console versions

661
00:33:18,016 --> 00:33:19,316
would have a much easier time of it.

662
00:33:19,857 --> 00:33:21,437
Since I was writing the SNES version,

663
00:33:21,597 --> 00:33:22,838
I was really thankful for that

664
00:33:23,198 --> 00:33:24,078
because it would have been a nightmare.

665
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,460
I did even find the Lemmings 2 editor.

666
00:33:30,061 --> 00:33:31,201
Having never used this before,

667
00:33:31,221 --> 00:33:32,682
I have no idea what I'm doing in it.

668
00:33:34,783 --> 00:33:34,923
So.

669
00:33:37,028 --> 00:33:40,029
It's basically tile maps, so it's 16 by 8 tiles.

670
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:44,570
And unlike Lightning 1, you could actually

671
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:47,691
put tiles into the background to be a picture as well.

672
00:33:49,031 --> 00:33:52,052
They just didn't go towards the mask for the collision.

673
00:33:53,312 --> 00:33:57,953
We also had that spare page idea, which we've used since,

674
00:33:58,533 --> 00:34:00,854
because they didn't want designers spending

675
00:34:01,034 --> 00:34:02,874
all their time trying to glue together

676
00:34:02,914 --> 00:34:03,995
these tiny little blocks.

677
00:34:04,934 --> 00:34:07,556
So we ended up having a sheet that had all the blocks

678
00:34:07,816 --> 00:34:09,418
glued together for us, and you just click on it

679
00:34:09,438 --> 00:34:10,058
and paste it in.

680
00:34:10,539 --> 00:34:13,461
And it made tile design incredibly rapid.

681
00:34:14,022 --> 00:34:15,543
You see there, you just go and click and you pick it up.

682
00:34:16,724 --> 00:34:18,806
You'll also notice this one's been put in behind mode.

683
00:34:19,187 --> 00:34:20,788
So that means lemmings will just walk in front of it

684
00:34:20,828 --> 00:34:21,329
and ignore it.

685
00:34:24,792 --> 00:34:26,033
And again, like Lemmings 1,

686
00:34:26,654 --> 00:34:28,015
this is built directly into the game

687
00:34:28,055 --> 00:34:29,056
for exactly the same reason.

688
00:34:29,356 --> 00:34:31,538
You need that fast turnaround in a game like this.

689
00:34:37,603 --> 00:34:41,546
The actual tile stuff was done so that you'd have a certain

690
00:34:41,586 --> 00:34:43,287
number of tiles available.

691
00:34:44,347 --> 00:34:46,508
A chunk of them would be pre-allocated like this that

692
00:34:46,528 --> 00:34:47,409
you couldn't modify.

693
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:50,590
So when you started building, it would basically copy that

694
00:34:50,651 --> 00:34:54,232
tile into a new unique tile just for that slot, and then

695
00:34:54,272 --> 00:34:56,934
build through it or take away the ground, and make that area

696
00:34:57,014 --> 00:34:58,215
a little bit map in its own right.

697
00:34:59,642 --> 00:35:03,465
Now, the Amiga, ST, and PC had oodles of memory for this stuff,

698
00:35:03,745 --> 00:35:05,407
so they can kind of do it infinitely.

699
00:35:05,827 --> 00:35:07,128
The SNES version didn't.

700
00:35:07,588 --> 00:35:10,030
It had a severely restricted amount of memory.

701
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,952
So the levels had to be redesigned for the SNES one

702
00:35:13,273 --> 00:35:17,176
so that you didn't have the kind of infinite destructibility

703
00:35:17,256 --> 00:35:18,156
or building of the level.

704
00:35:21,374 --> 00:35:25,978
So this is the character map stuff that I was talking about.

705
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:27,699
So it was a 32-bit character map

706
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,820
with the character number at the bottom.

707
00:35:30,421 --> 00:35:31,982
Now there's two bits in here that are interesting.

708
00:35:32,062 --> 00:35:33,243
One is the behind mode.

709
00:35:33,683 --> 00:35:35,265
So basically when we were drawing the tile,

710
00:35:35,305 --> 00:35:37,046
that would mean don't do any collision with that

711
00:35:37,066 --> 00:35:37,947
and you could walk in front of it.

712
00:35:38,407 --> 00:35:40,368
And that meant you could get a much nicer picture

713
00:35:40,949 --> 00:35:44,071
than Lemmings 1 with the plain black background.

714
00:35:44,832 --> 00:35:46,313
The other one is the no modify.

715
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:48,174
Now, you remember from Lemmings 1,

716
00:35:48,575 --> 00:35:50,776
we had these rectangular things that were crap.

717
00:35:51,377 --> 00:35:53,878
So what this meant was each tile that you put down,

718
00:35:54,378 --> 00:35:56,719
you could flag as you will not destroy it,

719
00:35:56,759 --> 00:35:57,739
you will not modify it.

720
00:35:58,099 --> 00:36:01,100
And that gave us perfect metal detection for a change.

721
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,361
So when it came to reallocate that tile and copy it

722
00:36:04,381 --> 00:36:06,362
and modify it, we just look at that bit and go,

723
00:36:06,462 --> 00:36:07,262
no, we're not going to do that.

724
00:36:07,843 --> 00:36:09,563
And that meant we got perfect metal.

725
00:36:09,603 --> 00:36:11,084
So we could destroy stuff around it,

726
00:36:11,524 --> 00:36:12,924
but not modify these tiles.

727
00:36:14,225 --> 00:36:15,946
There's other things in here to do with clicking

728
00:36:16,046 --> 00:36:16,746
on things like the.

729
00:36:17,648 --> 00:36:21,431
canons there, so there's offsets and collisions and stuff like that in there as well.

730
00:36:24,394 --> 00:36:25,735
This is from the SNES one.

731
00:36:27,897 --> 00:36:29,519
That was the memory map that I had.

732
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:34,343
And I was a little bit tight on memory on the VRAM.

733
00:36:36,125 --> 00:36:39,908
The biggest problem with the SNES version was that even though it has lots of hardware,

734
00:36:40,249 --> 00:36:41,830
I couldn't use hardly any of it.

735
00:36:42,711 --> 00:36:45,594
SNES is really just, you could have like 16 sprites in a line.

736
00:36:46,215 --> 00:36:47,737
When you've got, I could only do 80,

737
00:36:48,357 --> 00:36:49,899
but when you've got 80 lemmings in a row,

738
00:36:50,379 --> 00:36:51,861
clearly hardware sprites aren't gonna cut it.

739
00:36:52,442 --> 00:36:55,305
So I did end up having to draw all the lemmings in software.

740
00:36:55,665 --> 00:36:57,287
So this was on a three and a half megahertz 65816.

741
00:36:57,567 --> 00:36:58,128
So it was a 16-bit 6502.

742
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,680
Now, the SNES did, however, have a four-color screen.

743
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,861
So you can see at the bottom,

744
00:37:06,901 --> 00:37:08,001
it's got the bit planes laid out,

745
00:37:08,402 --> 00:37:10,662
but the four-color screen is just straight columns.

746
00:37:11,163 --> 00:37:13,864
And what that meant was I could have my Lemmings graphics

747
00:37:13,904 --> 00:37:15,464
and then just paste them vertically

748
00:37:15,764 --> 00:37:17,305
and then draw them in columns,

749
00:37:17,625 --> 00:37:19,205
and it made it very fast to draw.

750
00:37:19,906 --> 00:37:21,106
I also had other tricks like 65816.

751
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:24,147
You could reposition zero page,

752
00:37:24,167 --> 00:37:26,488
for those of you who know what a 6502 thing is,

753
00:37:27,448 --> 00:37:29,149
and I could put that towards the base of the graphic

754
00:37:29,169 --> 00:37:30,610
to shave off a few extra cycles.

755
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:31,651
and get it in.

756
00:37:32,433 --> 00:37:33,695
Because this screen was being transferred

757
00:37:33,735 --> 00:37:36,099
every game cycle, I could also use it for explosions,

758
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,844
the filler, and anything else I wanted to

759
00:37:39,044 --> 00:37:40,787
kind of regenerate every frame.

760
00:37:41,228 --> 00:37:42,611
So it was super useful for that.

761
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:48,713
I did also have to put in a parallax background just to make it a bit prettier, because Dave

762
00:37:48,813 --> 00:37:50,915
seemed to think that console games should look nicer.

763
00:37:52,755 --> 00:37:55,297
But the Amiga game apparently could just look as bad as he wanted it to.

764
00:37:57,858 --> 00:38:02,560
He also didn't like the fact that it didn't smooth scroll, so the Amiga and PC versions

765
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,001
were all...

766
00:38:03,801 --> 00:38:06,303
like the Lemmings, the original Lemmings one, it was quite a juttery scroll,

767
00:38:07,164 --> 00:38:09,746
but he kind of demanded I went and smooth scrolled everything.

768
00:38:10,287 --> 00:38:13,429
So I came up with a system to kind of interrupt scroll it and get it working,

769
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:17,333
and then managed to persuade them to go and put it into the Amiga versions as well.

770
00:38:17,653 --> 00:38:20,095
So at least they were pretty to look at.

771
00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:26,453
I did also have some of the sprites as skills.

772
00:38:26,733 --> 00:38:28,175
So any skill that was,

773
00:38:29,096 --> 00:38:30,697
you weren't gonna get too many in a row.

774
00:38:30,897 --> 00:38:34,040
So Poe Voltaire, Magnol Boutard, Superman,

775
00:38:34,281 --> 00:38:35,742
they were all sprites that I could draw.

776
00:38:36,403 --> 00:38:39,766
Anything where you got a dancer or a blocker or followers,

777
00:38:39,786 --> 00:38:40,947
where you could have loads of them,

778
00:38:41,347 --> 00:38:44,570
they all had to be drawn in software very quickly.

779
00:38:48,068 --> 00:38:53,029
The front end screen in Lamy's 2 on the SNES has a few hidden things.

780
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:57,030
Probably the one that most people found was the little hole in the tree.

781
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:59,890
That was a music test. You click that and it just cycled the music.

782
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:03,551
Less likely to find was if you clicked all the windows and doors,

783
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:04,911
you got a cheat mode.

784
00:39:05,351 --> 00:39:07,012
I have no idea what the cheat mode actually does.

785
00:39:07,052 --> 00:39:07,932
It just comes up cheat mode.

786
00:39:08,572 --> 00:39:09,912
I'd have to go back and try and figure it out.

787
00:39:12,153 --> 00:39:15,273
You click the dot at the top, you got what I called visual sound effects.

788
00:39:17,077 --> 00:39:20,140
I actually had quite a lot of time at the end of Lemmings to mess about.

789
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:25,404
Psygnosis took quite a lot of time to get things like maker codes and cartridge stuff

790
00:39:25,465 --> 00:39:26,325
all kind of organized.

791
00:39:26,746 --> 00:39:29,668
So I ended up playing for a while, a good while.

792
00:39:30,629 --> 00:39:33,872
And so to entertain myself, I put hidden Easter eggs in.

793
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:38,297
So visual sound effects is when a Lemming flies through the screen and he kind of yells

794
00:39:38,457 --> 00:39:41,860
going across or he hits the ground and goes oof, you get the little text coming above

795
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:42,921
his head as he does it.

796
00:39:44,225 --> 00:39:47,807
Now, there is a single pixel on that screen with that end sequence points,

797
00:39:48,228 --> 00:39:52,530
just under the two, that if you click it, you will get straight to the end sequence.

798
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:55,772
It was done as a test, then I thought, sod it, just leave it in.

799
00:39:56,493 --> 00:39:57,473
Nobody will find it.

800
00:39:58,274 --> 00:40:00,615
So, but it's super handy.

801
00:40:00,635 --> 00:40:01,976
If you just want to go and see the end sequence,

802
00:40:01,996 --> 00:40:04,938
you can just find that little pixel, click it, you get straight there.

803
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:09,540
So, there's the visual sound effects in Lemmings 2.

804
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,761
You can see this is the SNES one.

805
00:40:10,881 --> 00:40:12,202
It's got that parallax background.

806
00:40:13,781 --> 00:40:14,982
You'll also notice I have snow.

807
00:40:15,843 --> 00:40:19,666
Again, I was really bored, so I put snow in.

808
00:40:19,886 --> 00:40:22,508
I did start by having snow land on the ground.

809
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,389
I had all these routines for the filler

810
00:40:24,409 --> 00:40:26,311
for doing plot a pixel in the level,

811
00:40:26,731 --> 00:40:28,973
so I thought, have snow come down, rest on the ground,

812
00:40:29,133 --> 00:40:29,974
that'll be really nice.

813
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:33,875
It didn't occur to me at the time that actually,

814
00:40:33,935 --> 00:40:34,995
if you just wait long enough,

815
00:40:35,215 --> 00:40:36,736
that saves you having to do a builder

816
00:40:36,776 --> 00:40:39,137
because the snow just builds up and you can just walk up.

817
00:40:39,658 --> 00:40:41,859
Or if you'd spent ages digging through something,

818
00:40:41,919 --> 00:40:44,060
it's now just gonna fill that area in.

819
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,961
So I ended up having to take it out

820
00:40:45,981 --> 00:40:47,461
and it was just decorative in front of stuff.

821
00:40:48,762 --> 00:40:51,824
You'll also notice that kind of column starting to appear.

822
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:56,106
My random number generator was crap.

823
00:40:57,055 --> 00:41:02,358
And if you left it long enough, you would just get a single column kind of wobbling down.

824
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,360
Fortunately, most of the levels, in fact, all the levels didn't run that long.

825
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:09,862
It was usually I went out for lunch, came back, and I just have this vertical column going.

826
00:41:10,483 --> 00:41:15,185
But you did occasionally get these columns appear towards the end of a level.

827
00:41:16,446 --> 00:41:17,446
But there you go.

828
00:41:20,166 --> 00:41:24,187
The SNES version also gave me the hardest bug I've ever had.

829
00:41:25,207 --> 00:41:26,787
It took me three months to track down.

830
00:41:27,807 --> 00:41:29,628
Basically, a lemming would be walking along the ground,

831
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:32,028
and then every now and again, he would just fall halfway

832
00:41:32,048 --> 00:41:33,168
through the ground and then get stuck.

833
00:41:34,809 --> 00:41:36,689
I could not figure out for the life of me what it is.

834
00:41:36,709 --> 00:41:38,889
I would go through the code, just reading it,

835
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:40,250
dry running it, everything.

836
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:44,090
I eventually tracked it down to the Super Nintendo

837
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,131
has a hardware multiply.

838
00:41:45,151 --> 00:41:46,751
It's actually got two hardware multiplies.

839
00:41:48,128 --> 00:41:51,611
One of them is tied to the mode seven stuff,

840
00:41:51,711 --> 00:41:52,692
and it's actually instant.

841
00:41:52,712 --> 00:41:54,433
You put it in, you get the result back straight away.

842
00:41:54,913 --> 00:41:56,294
There was another one where you put it in,

843
00:41:56,655 --> 00:41:59,237
and then 16 cycles would pass, then you'd get the answer.

844
00:41:59,877 --> 00:42:01,719
So naturally, you use the one that's instant.

845
00:42:02,539 --> 00:42:03,360
Turns out, though.

846
00:42:04,345 --> 00:42:07,788
As it crossed the vertical blank, that would reset that register.

847
00:42:07,808 --> 00:42:09,809
It wasn't in any documentation.

848
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:11,030
Nintendo didn't even know about it.

849
00:42:11,711 --> 00:42:15,594
And it only happened between two 6502 instructions.

850
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:20,498
So when I wrote the final value and read it out in between these, if there was a vertical

851
00:42:20,518 --> 00:42:22,700
blank interrupt happen, I would get the wrong answer.

852
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,762
So just occasionally, a lemon would fall through the ground.

853
00:42:26,903 --> 00:42:27,303
Nightmare.

854
00:42:27,844 --> 00:42:32,307
So I ended up swapping to the other multiply, taking the speed hit, but finally figuring

855
00:42:32,347 --> 00:42:32,568
it out.

856
00:42:33,762 --> 00:42:34,122
Horrible.

857
00:42:34,182 --> 00:42:36,764
Hardware bugs are just the hardest to find.

858
00:42:39,065 --> 00:42:39,906
Another thing I did.

859
00:42:42,327 --> 00:42:44,548
Yeah.

860
00:42:45,169 --> 00:42:46,810
I did mention I was bored, didn't I?

861
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:51,012
So I borrowed a Super Scope from Russell Key's company

862
00:42:51,853 --> 00:42:54,114
because he just came up with this wacky idea

863
00:42:54,134 --> 00:42:55,995
and I thought, you know, why not?

864
00:42:56,435 --> 00:42:58,516
So if you plug a Super Scope into the second port,

865
00:42:58,957 --> 00:43:01,898
you can aim and shoot the Lemmings just for the hell of it.

866
00:43:03,954 --> 00:43:07,635
They do just blow up, there's no real point to it, but it's so satisfying.

867
00:43:10,156 --> 00:43:14,757
Now the Aardman guys were going to a conference and they wanted to do this thing on hidden

868
00:43:14,777 --> 00:43:15,897
Easter eggs that nobody had found.

869
00:43:16,297 --> 00:43:19,618
So they got in touch and they asked me about it and I went, yeah, this one's never been

870
00:43:19,658 --> 00:43:19,958
found.

871
00:43:20,238 --> 00:43:23,819
So I told them about it, they did this really nice video, you can go and see it on YouTube,

872
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:26,960
it's really funny, where they kind of get it and they just shoot and they're chuckling

873
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:27,460
away as well.

874
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,400
It's highly satisfying.

875
00:43:32,261 --> 00:43:36,309
So, Lightning's 3. I just want to mention one thing and then we will never speak of it again.

876
00:43:38,892 --> 00:43:43,234
So the biggest problem with Lemmings 3 is the character size.

877
00:43:43,695 --> 00:43:46,936
Now you can see there as they walk, they've got the feet go on specific blocks and so on.

878
00:43:47,456 --> 00:43:50,958
And that meant whenever you selected something, it had to be on this, you know,

879
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:53,960
a specific boundary for them to do things.

880
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,581
That kind of got rid of that kind of instant Lemming click do something.

881
00:43:58,402 --> 00:44:00,983
Now the whole reason for this was we actually got contacted

882
00:44:01,423 --> 00:44:02,904
by the Children's Television Workshop,

883
00:44:03,644 --> 00:44:05,745
who thought, you know, Lemmings, there's a lot of them,

884
00:44:05,945 --> 00:44:08,026
we could probably count them on TV, that'd be great.

885
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:10,350
But they were just too small.

886
00:44:11,451 --> 00:44:13,532
So Dave thought, oh, yeah, Sesame Street,

887
00:44:13,772 --> 00:44:14,553
oh, we'll want a bit of that.

888
00:44:15,313 --> 00:44:18,195
So we started doing the game, made the limings bigger,

889
00:44:18,535 --> 00:44:20,256
kind of lost a lot of the charm with it,

890
00:44:21,776 --> 00:44:23,157
and put in lots of restrictions

891
00:44:23,217 --> 00:44:25,058
and just kind of spoiled some of it a bit.

892
00:44:25,578 --> 00:44:27,599
And then Sesame Street didn't use it.

893
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:31,321
But I mean, it's...

894
00:44:33,068 --> 00:44:37,550
The third one, I think, certainly just broke some of the real niceties of Lemmings.

895
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:40,232
The tiny, wee characters and stuff, I think, are really what make it.

896
00:44:42,653 --> 00:44:46,775
Now, in Dundee, they have taken Lemmings to heart,

897
00:44:47,216 --> 00:44:50,778
and just the games culture in general.

898
00:44:51,238 --> 00:44:54,700
So we actually have a spot in their museum, which is the weirdest thing ever.

899
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,501
Seeing your own stuff in a museum and you're not dead yet.

900
00:44:59,402 --> 00:45:00,243
It's very strange.

901
00:45:01,928 --> 00:45:04,612
And there's also this art being done as public artwork

902
00:45:05,032 --> 00:45:06,574
where they've got lions climbing up walls

903
00:45:06,675 --> 00:45:08,016
just up from the original office,

904
00:45:08,577 --> 00:45:10,680
which is, again, the coolest thing in the world.

905
00:45:11,862 --> 00:45:12,563
It's very cool.

906
00:45:13,264 --> 00:45:15,988
So the stuff in the museum was donated

907
00:45:16,048 --> 00:45:17,089
by a few folk from DMA.

908
00:45:17,834 --> 00:45:22,016
I put the big lemming in, there's actually a DMA design sign there that I pinched on

909
00:45:22,036 --> 00:45:26,438
the last day from one of the offices, even though Dave didn't like that because he couldn't

910
00:45:26,478 --> 00:45:27,898
get posts put there anymore.

911
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:33,120
But it's very cool, so if you've got Dundee, these things are around there, it's very nice.

912
00:45:35,321 --> 00:45:36,082
And that's it.

913
00:45:37,082 --> 00:45:38,122
There's all us old fogies now.

914
00:45:52,472 --> 00:45:55,935
If anybody's still awake and wants to ask anything, I can.

915
00:45:56,115 --> 00:45:57,436
Otherwise you can make a break for it.

916
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:00,098
No?

917
00:46:02,921 --> 00:46:04,042
Oh, so close.

918
00:46:04,102 --> 00:46:05,063
Thanks, really good game.

919
00:46:07,044 --> 00:46:10,127
Worms always felt like a spiritual successor to lemmings.

920
00:46:10,988 --> 00:46:11,769
It was just like worms.

921
00:46:11,829 --> 00:46:13,110
We don't speak of worms in that.

922
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:13,430
Oh, okay.

923
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:15,752
Yeah.

924
00:46:16,638 --> 00:46:17,759
I mean, it was just a small character.

925
00:46:17,779 --> 00:46:19,079
There was a few games that came out,

926
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,241
you got humans as well, that kind of came out

927
00:46:21,261 --> 00:46:21,901
at the same time.

928
00:46:23,002 --> 00:46:26,304
Worms, we felt, borrowed a few things from us,

929
00:46:26,624 --> 00:46:27,104
shall we say.

930
00:46:27,124 --> 00:46:28,925
They've obviously gone on.

931
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:30,566
It's been a shame that Sony's kind of sat

932
00:46:30,627 --> 00:46:32,748
on the IP for so long.

933
00:46:32,988 --> 00:46:34,569
So, yeah.

934
00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:35,470
Meh.

935
00:46:40,236 --> 00:46:42,337
Great talk by the way, that was really interesting.

936
00:46:43,458 --> 00:46:46,160
So you mentioned you made introductory levels

937
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,481
for the first Lemmings, where you taught the different skills.

938
00:46:49,462 --> 00:46:50,783
How did you arrive at the conclusion

939
00:46:50,823 --> 00:46:53,044
that that was something the game actually needed?

940
00:46:55,105 --> 00:46:56,666
I mean, the actual levels themselves,

941
00:46:56,686 --> 00:46:57,847
when you start with the skills,

942
00:46:59,128 --> 00:47:01,530
particularly because it was a new genre really,

943
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:03,951
we always felt that it was just...

944
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:08,331
You want that slow entry point and just so people can have a play with it.

945
00:47:09,012 --> 00:47:11,513
Lemmings 2 we had the practice mode, we could just go and fiddle.

946
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:15,414
But the original Lemmings didn't really have that so it was really just the

947
00:47:15,454 --> 00:47:17,315
best way of letting people play with things and

948
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,836
see what the outcome of them were going to be I think.

949
00:47:21,057 --> 00:47:21,617
Okay thanks.

950
00:47:23,458 --> 00:47:27,260
I just want to thank you for making my middle school teachers head explode.

951
00:47:28,393 --> 00:47:29,414
when she saw that 1666 level.

952
00:47:29,534 --> 00:47:31,395
It was wonderful.

953
00:47:31,535 --> 00:47:32,015
Thank you.

954
00:47:32,435 --> 00:47:35,496
The deep south, the south down here really didn't like that.

955
00:47:35,536 --> 00:47:36,277
There was a big uproar.

956
00:47:36,297 --> 00:47:37,137
It was quite amusing.

957
00:47:37,917 --> 00:47:38,057
Yes.

958
00:47:38,117 --> 00:47:39,198
I loved it today.

959
00:47:39,338 --> 00:47:42,519
Oh, he's got a notepad.

960
00:47:46,518 --> 00:47:50,521
Was there a process behind coming up with the name?

961
00:47:51,061 --> 00:47:53,643
Like, were other names considered for Lemmings?

962
00:47:54,103 --> 00:47:55,864
No, actually, it was again, Russell K.

963
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:58,306
Pretty much when he saw the original animation,

964
00:47:58,766 --> 00:48:00,047
he just went, they're like little Lemmings.

965
00:48:00,668 --> 00:48:01,669
That was it. It just stuck.

966
00:48:02,609 --> 00:48:04,631
And it fits it perfectly for it.

967
00:48:06,703 --> 00:48:12,750
G'day. Just wanted to talk about what it might have felt like during the Lemmings mania of

968
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:19,157
when it came out. I know I've found some stuff recently where there was a couple of novels

969
00:48:20,139 --> 00:48:23,863
at the time, which is interesting, and a few old articles about there's a movie that might

970
00:48:23,883 --> 00:48:25,144
be made and all this sort of stuff.

971
00:48:25,625 --> 00:48:28,166
I mean, when we were making the game, you have no idea.

972
00:48:28,586 --> 00:48:30,427
It's the same for any game being made.

973
00:48:30,467 --> 00:48:31,968
You have not a clue if it's going to do well.

974
00:48:33,008 --> 00:48:35,249
The same was true, you know, Dead Lion King's Landlight

975
00:48:35,269 --> 00:48:37,610
with a GTA, and it's just, you had no idea.

976
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:39,091
You do the game that you think is fun.

977
00:48:39,651 --> 00:48:41,352
When it came out and it kind of exploded,

978
00:48:41,912 --> 00:48:44,474
because we were getting 100% reviews at some times,

979
00:48:44,494 --> 00:48:45,594
it was just insane.

980
00:48:45,614 --> 00:48:48,776
You know, you're just kind of strutting about going,

981
00:48:48,796 --> 00:48:49,156
this is cool.

982
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:52,057
And then you got things like in the Lemmings too,

983
00:48:52,077 --> 00:48:54,138
there was that song that got done as well,

984
00:48:54,579 --> 00:48:56,680
in a rap song, it's just the bizarrest thing.

985
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,541
But I love seeing, even at expos now,

986
00:48:59,581 --> 00:49:02,043
you'll get folk, several folk dressed as Lemmings

987
00:49:02,063 --> 00:49:04,104
just walking around expos and stuff, and it's brilliant.

988
00:49:04,364 --> 00:49:06,065
Some of the fan art and stuff that gets done's amazing.

989
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:07,085
So we just love it.

990
00:49:07,853 --> 00:49:18,576
Awesome. Also, did you see at the time with things like Oh No More Lemmings and Christmas Lemmings and all that sort of stuff, did that see a big jump again when those came out a bit later?

991
00:49:18,716 --> 00:49:26,899
Well, Christmas Lemmings was done as a demo disc. Because the original one came out at the start of the year, we wanted another one just to remind folk it was kind of there.

992
00:49:27,299 --> 00:49:33,261
So Gary Timmons had done the Lemmings with the little Christmas suits on and they were just really cool and we thought we should do a demo of that.

993
00:49:34,961 --> 00:49:37,162
of the animations, you know, the bouncy snowman and stuff.

994
00:49:37,502 --> 00:49:40,243
And we just did a demo disc and then Psygnosis,

995
00:49:40,283 --> 00:49:41,984
being the money people that they are, went,

996
00:49:42,064 --> 00:49:43,384
ooh, new franchise.

997
00:49:43,904 --> 00:49:45,205
And they'd haul the limings out of it.

998
00:49:45,425 --> 00:49:47,986
So, I mean, we were just kind of riding the wave

999
00:49:48,046 --> 00:49:48,926
and enjoying it, really.

1000
00:49:49,366 --> 00:49:49,987
Cool, awesome.

1001
00:49:53,105 --> 00:49:56,430
I'm Eli and thank you for animating that snowman.

1002
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:58,614
It was my favorite snowman as a kid.

1003
00:49:58,714 --> 00:50:00,557
I did get complaints that it didn't kill you.

1004
00:50:01,118 --> 00:50:04,544
But because it was a Christmas thing, we wanted to be nice.

1005
00:50:04,884 --> 00:50:06,227
Turns out that was the wrong thing to do.

1006
00:50:08,686 --> 00:50:13,691
This is kind of a random question, but when it kind of became general knowledge that

1007
00:50:15,213 --> 00:50:20,258
Lemmings don't actually jump off cliffs to kill themselves and it was an exposed as an urban legend

1008
00:50:21,279 --> 00:50:23,942
Did you reflect on the name at all? No, I didn't give a shit

1009
00:50:30,076 --> 00:50:34,200
Hi, I was wondering if you could speak a little bit about the sound effects you chose for Lemmings,

1010
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:39,004
because blowing them up was satisfying, but the little sound they made before they blow up was equally as satisfying.

1011
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:45,690
So, the sound was interesting, because we did start with 60 theme tunes from movies,

1012
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:47,311
but that was just the point where...

1013
00:50:48,476 --> 00:50:50,217
all the movie studios were getting interested in games

1014
00:50:50,237 --> 00:50:51,237
because they were starting to make money

1015
00:50:51,477 --> 00:50:52,617
and we thought it would be a bad idea

1016
00:50:52,657 --> 00:50:54,018
to put them in and then get sued by them.

1017
00:50:54,698 --> 00:50:58,379
So we did the random tunes just made up

1018
00:50:58,939 --> 00:51:00,820
and then the sound effects was actually

1019
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,241
the Scott Johnson who did the background art,

1020
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:06,622
it was actually his mother that did all the sound effects

1021
00:51:06,642 --> 00:51:07,422
for the Lemmings.

1022
00:51:07,842 --> 00:51:09,182
I think they were sped up a little bit.

1023
00:51:09,583 --> 00:51:10,643
Yeah, getting nods.

1024
00:51:10,803 --> 00:51:11,703
So they were sped up a little bit

1025
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:13,144
but she did all the sound effects for that

1026
00:51:13,824 --> 00:51:15,184
and they just fit perfectly.

1027
00:51:15,704 --> 00:51:16,185
Awesome, thanks.

1028
00:51:18,001 --> 00:51:23,483
In the original Lemmings, I think when you made a Lemming a climber and a floater, they become like an athlete.

1029
00:51:23,763 --> 00:51:23,944
Yeah.

1030
00:51:24,184 --> 00:51:24,824
And I was just wondering...

1031
00:51:24,844 --> 00:51:26,265
That's because it had two skills.

1032
00:51:26,285 --> 00:51:29,766
Because when you hovered the cursor over, it told you what it was.

1033
00:51:29,807 --> 00:51:30,847
He's a builder, he's a walker.

1034
00:51:31,207 --> 00:51:36,470
So you needed that differentiation to go, you've got both of those skills without trying to fill that whole space,

1035
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:38,051
because it was limited down there.

1036
00:51:38,471 --> 00:51:39,932
So it just, yeah, became an athlete.

1037
00:51:40,172 --> 00:51:41,192
That makes a lot of sense.

1038
00:51:43,193 --> 00:51:44,474
I think we're done. Thank you very much.
