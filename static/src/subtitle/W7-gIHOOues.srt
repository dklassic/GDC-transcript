1
00:00:07,427 --> 00:00:13,810
That was just for you to set the levels just so you know. Welcome to Dialogue 101.

2
00:00:14,531 --> 00:00:20,814
I've been asked to request that you guys move up and into the centers of the rows

3
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:30,258
so that Johnny Come Latelys can occupy the aisle seats. Now. So once again, hello.

4
00:00:34,872 --> 00:00:35,192
Hello.

5
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:37,273
Hello!

6
00:00:37,493 --> 00:00:37,894
Thank you.

7
00:00:39,634 --> 00:00:42,776
We've got a lot of ground to cover, so I am going to start.

8
00:00:42,796 --> 00:00:44,656
Is that okay with you?

9
00:00:45,137 --> 00:00:45,337
Good?

10
00:00:45,557 --> 00:00:46,017
Yes, good.

11
00:00:46,497 --> 00:00:48,318
Here's an overview of what we're going to do.

12
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:52,960
I'm going to approach this session from the assumption that you have been tasked with

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,582
getting voices into your game, and you said you knew how.

14
00:01:00,223 --> 00:01:01,264
Don't panic.

15
00:01:01,404 --> 00:01:02,824
This thing is really fun.

16
00:01:04,082 --> 00:01:09,829
at some point. Here is a high level overview of what we're going to be going through. Hopefully

17
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:14,554
by some miracle we'll have enough time for a lot of Q&A which is my favorite part.

18
00:01:16,147 --> 00:01:18,289
So this is me. It's not super important.

19
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,172
I founded a company called Bright Skull about a year ago.

20
00:01:21,312 --> 00:01:25,316
Before that, I was the the audio lead in charge of dialogue at 2K.

21
00:01:26,157 --> 00:01:30,722
Marin. I did Bioshock 2, Minerva's Den, XCOM, The Bureau,

22
00:01:31,022 --> 00:01:33,344
and most recently The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.

23
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:35,146
I'm also a dad.

24
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:36,488
It's pretty sweet.

25
00:01:36,928 --> 00:01:37,428
Two kids.

26
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:39,030
Public school.

27
00:01:41,753 --> 00:01:47,957
a recovering musician, amateur magician, a motorcycle enthusiast.

28
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:51,359
That's me in a nutshell. Not important.

29
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,200
What is important is pre-production.

30
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,982
Get that in your heads. Pre-production. It's important.

31
00:01:58,343 --> 00:02:01,585
Before you can begin, you need to gather lots of metrics

32
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:05,808
and provide data for your team and for yourself and your development partners.

33
00:02:07,059 --> 00:02:12,721
So the first thing I do when I approach a new project is to run analytics on the scripts

34
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:14,641
and extract a lot of data.

35
00:02:15,322 --> 00:02:18,723
In case you're wondering, this is not the fun part I spoke of.

36
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:20,423
Duh.

37
00:02:21,103 --> 00:02:25,785
Here's an example of the end results of a script analytics that I ran recently.

38
00:02:25,885 --> 00:02:27,705
Well, it's a mock-up that I made just for this.

39
00:02:27,905 --> 00:02:31,506
So clearly these are not real character names.

40
00:02:33,864 --> 00:02:35,026
Pay attention to the slides, man.

41
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:36,229
There's some good ones in there.

42
00:02:37,812 --> 00:02:41,780
But this is all data that I use to forecast budgeting and casting

43
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,361
information.

44
00:02:42,381 --> 00:02:42,421
So.

45
00:02:44,112 --> 00:02:50,538
These columns over here are a list of every character that speaks a line in the project

46
00:02:50,618 --> 00:02:53,661
and any relevant data that I might need for casting them.

47
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:59,125
In this example, you'll see the sex, the age, the accent, the unique code used in the scripts

48
00:02:59,165 --> 00:03:00,927
to identify that character.

49
00:03:01,027 --> 00:03:06,291
It's also usually the same code that's used in engine, which we're not even going to delve

50
00:03:06,331 --> 00:03:06,431
into.

51
00:03:06,472 --> 00:03:07,632
I don't even know why I said that.

52
00:03:08,513 --> 00:03:10,095
These columns here...

53
00:03:11,096 --> 00:03:15,181
are the sum total of all of the lines that character speaks in the game

54
00:03:15,241 --> 00:03:17,704
divided up by, in this case, level.

55
00:03:17,984 --> 00:03:23,411
It could also be by by stage or mission or whoever else your game is broken down.

56
00:03:23,431 --> 00:03:27,756
Hell, geez, I'm going to try and get through this without cursing.

57
00:03:27,796 --> 00:03:29,779
I don't think I messed up already, but whatever.

58
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:35,338
So I break it out like this on purpose, not just because I really love Data.

59
00:03:35,478 --> 00:03:39,939
It's because when I'm casting the game, I need to see how much space I have in

60
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:45,080
between, in between each character's appearance in the game in case we're

61
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,721
going to double up an actor on multiple voicings for a role, which happens

62
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:52,642
often in video games, but you don't want to have, you know, one dude voicing

63
00:03:52,682 --> 00:03:56,823
the same NPC in the same level, or even if you can avoid it in back to back levels.

64
00:03:58,965 --> 00:04:02,117
Also, I'm from New York, so when I say dude, I also mean women dudes.

65
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:03,402
I don't know what that means.

66
00:04:05,221 --> 00:04:09,863
This column here is the sum total count for all systemic or combat dialogue.

67
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:13,984
This gets handled separately for engine reasons,

68
00:04:14,064 --> 00:04:18,466
but also most importantly in casting and in metric analysis,

69
00:04:18,506 --> 00:04:22,788
because systemic lines are usually about four words per line on average,

70
00:04:22,948 --> 00:04:26,309
and narrative content is usually about 12 to 20 words per line.

71
00:04:26,369 --> 00:04:31,671
So it skews the actual line count that you will tally up later.

72
00:04:33,015 --> 00:04:38,620
probably show you that even finally once all that information is gathered I can make a

73
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:44,965
really loose high-level prediction for how I'm going to cast the game based on that data

74
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:52,371
so that's pretty much what the early analysis is now real quick before I move on every developer

75
00:04:52,411 --> 00:04:54,452
has a different way of doing scripts.

76
00:04:56,014 --> 00:04:59,458
Excel scripts are really good for this, but really bad for other things.

77
00:04:59,938 --> 00:05:07,166
And if you get a Word document script, a little pro tip that I'm going to hand you is I use find and replace to do my line counts.

78
00:05:07,727 --> 00:05:16,035
And what I'll do is I'll do a specific all caps find and replace to find the character name in the line headings if it's theatrically formatted.

79
00:05:16,656 --> 00:05:19,642
And that gives me a good sense of the line count in a rough estimate.

80
00:05:19,962 --> 00:05:23,869
Also, I use the highlight highlight tool to replace that so that I can easily look

81
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:25,973
through the script and see if I've missed any.

82
00:05:26,995 --> 00:05:29,680
Um, hope that wasn't, but, uh.

83
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:36,082
So now that I have all that data, I bring it into this second page in a workbook.

84
00:05:36,262 --> 00:05:40,643
I don't know if you guys have heard me talk before about how much Excel is used

85
00:05:40,723 --> 00:05:44,785
in game development, but one of the number one questions I get beyond, how did

86
00:05:44,825 --> 00:05:47,485
you break into video games is what software should I learn?

87
00:05:47,605 --> 00:05:54,047
Excel, learn Excel, learn Excel, Excel, see your, uh,

88
00:05:57,397 --> 00:06:01,640
Right, so now you have all the data you can project budgets for time and money,

89
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,862
which is what your producer wants to know.

90
00:06:05,683 --> 00:06:08,184
And lots of other people, I'm sure, including yourself.

91
00:06:09,205 --> 00:06:16,390
These rows and columns here are the totals for total split down by actor,

92
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,932
which we're able to parse with our early casting data

93
00:06:20,253 --> 00:06:24,016
for all the lines and for all the lines in the game.

94
00:06:24,816 --> 00:06:29,498
displaying the data like this allows us to see how many total lines we have and

95
00:06:29,538 --> 00:06:33,320
Then also allows us to see how much estimated time in the booth

96
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,162
It's going to take each actor and from that we can extrapolate the estimated cost per actor

97
00:06:40,003 --> 00:06:41,844
Some general guidelines to think about

98
00:06:46,004 --> 00:06:59,095
No more arrows. Union actors, you're going to want to budget $890.23 per actor. I usually round up to $1,000. That cost is the union fee for actor in a four hour session block.

99
00:06:59,115 --> 00:07:06,841
What that means is you get four hours of actor time. You can use ten minutes or you can use three hours and 59 minutes and 59 seconds and you're still going to pay.

100
00:07:07,982 --> 00:07:15,352
$890.23. It's not actually $890.23, but that includes the 10% agency fee on top in case any of you are union people going,

101
00:07:15,392 --> 00:07:16,614
that's not right, but it is.

102
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:23,335
For non-union actors, you want to budget $200 per hour

103
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,716
with a two-hour minimum.

104
00:07:25,417 --> 00:07:27,698
So that means that when you book a non-union actor,

105
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:28,439
you're going to be paying $400,

106
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:33,762
and then every hour after that is $200 per hour.

107
00:07:34,363 --> 00:07:37,405
You always round up, so that's something to keep in mind.

108
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:45,994
Now studios generally cost $200 per hour. That would be good VO studios in major cities,

109
00:07:46,595 --> 00:07:53,199
smaller cities and lesser studios might be less expensive. You might also be booking

110
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:59,183
a like the, you know, the presidential suite at POP and it might be a little bit more,

111
00:07:59,964 --> 00:08:02,645
which is an awesome room, by the way, it's not called the president is called the ADR

112
00:08:02,685 --> 00:08:05,227
stage. But if you call it the presidential suite, it just sounds cooler.

113
00:08:06,812 --> 00:08:12,094
This fee generally includes the engineer, the room, the coffee, the snacks, the massage

114
00:08:12,154 --> 00:08:13,415
table, the foot rubs.

115
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,556
Only some of those things are true.

116
00:08:15,656 --> 00:08:16,836
I'll let you figure out which.

117
00:08:17,576 --> 00:08:21,858
And most studios bill by the half day or the full day rate.

118
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,644
So now that you know how many actors you need, it's time to find them.

119
00:08:28,265 --> 00:08:32,669
The casting process breaks down into three really, really intuitive steps.

120
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,812
You have making casting materials.

121
00:08:35,272 --> 00:08:38,756
You have auditioning the talent, and then you make your selections.

122
00:08:40,357 --> 00:08:48,143
Casting sides. This is a term that we use to describe the bio and sample lines that we send out to the actors.

123
00:08:48,603 --> 00:08:50,525
They contain information about the character.

124
00:08:52,306 --> 00:08:56,449
And I'm going to bestow upon you some quick tips for writing casting sides,

125
00:08:56,469 --> 00:09:04,135
because this is an art form unto itself, which I don't feel many of us have from reading other people's casting sides.

126
00:09:06,022 --> 00:09:10,945
Casting sides should be short, one to two pages maximum.

127
00:09:11,165 --> 00:09:13,726
That's the upper limit for you mathematicians.

128
00:09:14,827 --> 00:09:17,508
The character information should be succinct, focused,

129
00:09:17,888 --> 00:09:20,890
and most importantly, useful to the actors.

130
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,771
They do not need to know that the character

131
00:09:23,811 --> 00:09:25,852
has a twin brother who later in the game

132
00:09:25,912 --> 00:09:28,714
becomes your mother, who is also your father, and.

133
00:09:29,574 --> 00:09:30,395
It's a crazy story.

134
00:09:30,415 --> 00:09:33,516
What they do need to know is that the character is male, 30 years old,

135
00:09:33,596 --> 00:09:38,179
Caucasian, grizzly, gravelly, bitter, and has a slight Texas twang.

136
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:42,401
That's a lot of adjectives in a short little space.

137
00:09:42,641 --> 00:09:44,002
That's what people need.

138
00:09:45,162 --> 00:09:48,664
Give the actors the ammunition they need to give you good reads.

139
00:09:49,985 --> 00:09:53,446
Think about it from the actor's point of view, which I don't know if many of you have had privy to,

140
00:09:53,546 --> 00:09:58,328
but sometimes the actor will be in the studio once a week, and that will be their audition day.

141
00:09:58,668 --> 00:10:01,629
They will have a stack of auditions about...

142
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,869
Yaaaaay high!

143
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:09,431
You give them the writer's version of the casting sides, and it's four pages long of bio?

144
00:10:09,451 --> 00:10:11,732
That's not getting read, man.

145
00:10:11,752 --> 00:10:13,933
Alright, um...

146
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:18,915
When choosing your sample lines, pick good ones.

147
00:10:19,236 --> 00:10:20,737
That's great advice there, right?

148
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:24,462
You don't need to hear every dramatic moment that's going to appear

149
00:10:24,482 --> 00:10:25,223
in your video game.

150
00:10:25,263 --> 00:10:29,708
What you do need to hear, though, is the emotional range of content

151
00:10:29,768 --> 00:10:31,571
that your actor is going to be performing.

152
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:34,634
So do they have a lot of dramatic reads?

153
00:10:35,831 --> 00:10:38,533
Do they also have some witty one liners?

154
00:10:39,114 --> 00:10:40,295
Maybe some death?

155
00:10:40,955 --> 00:10:42,316
Maybe some gloating?

156
00:10:42,437 --> 00:10:45,319
You want to make sure that you have the full extent of the palette in there.

157
00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:48,362
And in fact, if you think that that character might change,

158
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:50,824
write some fake stuff in there.

159
00:10:51,424 --> 00:10:54,187
Which goes to another point of mine.

160
00:10:55,952 --> 00:10:57,814
which apparently I'm going to get to in a minute, sorry.

161
00:10:58,334 --> 00:11:00,876
If it's a first-person shooter or a real-time strategy or any other game

162
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:06,561
that includes combat, always include deaths and combat in your sides.

163
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:12,125
You would be amazed at how many actors are not competent at combat VO.

164
00:11:12,646 --> 00:11:14,747
Great at dramatic reads and then you put them in your game

165
00:11:14,767 --> 00:11:17,450
and then you go get them in your combat section and it sounds like this.

166
00:11:23,443 --> 00:11:27,845
I did a session once and I'm not I'm not lying to you the lead the main character

167
00:11:27,905 --> 00:11:31,667
we finished all his dramatic stuff, and this is when I very early in my career and

168
00:11:31,867 --> 00:11:39,171
And I did not do the casting the the reed came out oof

169
00:11:42,112 --> 00:11:46,795
The Broadway actor very famous and that was what we got so we had to do a stand-in so

170
00:11:48,548 --> 00:11:49,369
Here's my advice to you.

171
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,833
Even if the character in your game

172
00:11:53,053 --> 00:11:56,616
currently does not become a combatant or die,

173
00:11:57,277 --> 00:12:01,421
still have them do combat and deaths, even if they stink at them.

174
00:12:01,781 --> 00:12:05,805
Trust me, you'll thank me someday with beer.

175
00:12:09,172 --> 00:12:12,852
So this is my final pro tip on casting sides.

176
00:12:13,672 --> 00:12:16,373
Casting sides are not going to generate shippable content.

177
00:12:16,413 --> 00:12:18,253
What they are going to generate are auditions

178
00:12:18,293 --> 00:12:19,413
for you to cast off of.

179
00:12:19,754 --> 00:12:21,254
It's very important to remember that.

180
00:12:21,914 --> 00:12:25,435
You do not have to use accurate character descriptions.

181
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,955
You do not have to use accurate lines.

182
00:12:27,995 --> 00:12:30,135
You can write whatever you want and the actor will say it.

183
00:12:31,256 --> 00:12:33,256
What you want to do is inform the actor

184
00:12:33,356 --> 00:12:34,436
with the tools that they need

185
00:12:34,476 --> 00:12:36,276
to give you the audition that you want.

186
00:12:37,077 --> 00:12:41,682
That is important, and it's important for you to bring back to your writers and producers

187
00:12:41,763 --> 00:12:44,906
if they give you guff, give them to me, and I will fist-a-cuff.

188
00:12:45,147 --> 00:12:46,829
I don't know what that means, but it felt good.

189
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:52,656
Alright, so now you have everything you need to find your voice talent.

190
00:12:52,736 --> 00:12:54,719
Great! Where do you find the actors?

191
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:55,439
Well...

192
00:12:56,369 --> 00:12:58,010
You can start with agencies.

193
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,031
Great place to start.

194
00:13:00,131 --> 00:13:02,693
Caveat with agencies, if you don't already know,

195
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:06,476
not every talent agency represents voice actors.

196
00:13:07,136 --> 00:13:10,918
A lot of them represent on screen talent or they represent theatrical actors.

197
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:15,621
You are looking specifically for agencies

198
00:13:15,842 --> 00:13:22,326
that represent voice talent that does interactive and or animation.

199
00:13:23,026 --> 00:13:26,891
not commercial, not radio, interactive or animation.

200
00:13:27,331 --> 00:13:30,915
Make sure that those agencies you're working with do that.

201
00:13:32,217 --> 00:13:33,579
Another thing that you want to.

202
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,483
Yeah, no, that's good. That's that's all you need to know.

203
00:13:39,113 --> 00:13:41,795
Casting directors are also great resources.

204
00:13:42,376 --> 00:13:45,338
They have very large pools of talent that are pre-vetted.

205
00:13:46,378 --> 00:13:51,262
And more importantly than agencies and yourselves,

206
00:13:51,402 --> 00:13:52,683
if you're not already experienced,

207
00:13:52,723 --> 00:13:54,784
is that they already have a network of people

208
00:13:55,184 --> 00:13:58,166
so they have access to people that you do not.

209
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:02,431
If you're even if you're working on a non-union project, this is true.

210
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:09,920
We can oftentimes get celebrity VO talent that may or may not be using a different name,

211
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,261
but they won't do it for you.

212
00:14:11,341 --> 00:14:12,443
They'll do it for people that they trust.

213
00:14:12,943 --> 00:14:14,726
So that's why a casting director is a good idea.

214
00:14:16,828 --> 00:14:19,890
There's also like online resources that I will not name.

215
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,531
They're not, they're OK.

216
00:14:23,732 --> 00:14:25,533
They're the kind of sites where you post your project

217
00:14:25,593 --> 00:14:28,075
and you say how much you're going to pay because you think you're saving money.

218
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:31,077
But in reality, you're going to screw yourself out of tons of money in the end

219
00:14:31,117 --> 00:14:32,277
because the talent you're going to get is.

220
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:39,591
gonna cost more than you thought. But you know, you can do that and you can do the research

221
00:14:39,611 --> 00:14:43,954
you want. I'm just not gonna recommend it. Lastly, there's also shoestring methods. There's,

222
00:14:43,994 --> 00:14:49,978
you know, your friends and Craigslist and local theater groups. It can work sometimes.

223
00:14:50,918 --> 00:14:56,242
Again, it's going to be way more time and money than you originally thought. And sometimes

224
00:14:56,282 --> 00:14:58,363
it works. I'm not I'm not saying it doesn't but

225
00:14:59,904 --> 00:15:04,045
if you hire a professional, it's pretty much guaranteed that it's going to work.

226
00:15:04,365 --> 00:15:07,225
So I'm going to soapbox for a second, not like I haven't been doing that the whole time,

227
00:15:07,745 --> 00:15:11,406
but audiences are becoming much more informed,

228
00:15:12,126 --> 00:15:15,867
especially when it comes to our games and our voices in them.

229
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:22,009
And they can be very forgiving about graphics and gameplay and many other things.

230
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:24,990
And I know I'm preaching to the choir here, but sound...

231
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:31,151
is the only real world asset in the game, especially voice.

232
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:36,372
So when you screw up voice or sound, but most importantly, voice,

233
00:15:38,712 --> 00:15:39,833
you really screw up.

234
00:15:39,933 --> 00:15:43,814
And the player has a very low threshold for for forgiving you

235
00:15:43,894 --> 00:15:45,914
any amount of leniency on that.

236
00:15:46,474 --> 00:15:49,975
So very important to to think about that upfront

237
00:15:49,995 --> 00:15:51,855
when you're figuring out how to pinch pennies.

238
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,861
So congratulations, you've got yourself a bunch of auditions to go through.

239
00:15:58,382 --> 00:15:59,523
Who's right for your game?

240
00:15:59,763 --> 00:16:01,564
Well, that's up to you.

241
00:16:02,184 --> 00:16:07,286
And I mean, you, not your fans, not the people on Kickstarter,

242
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:09,067
not the people on Twitter.

243
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:13,429
It's up to you, the game designer and the game audio designer

244
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:16,590
and the game casting director to make that choice.

245
00:16:18,699 --> 00:16:24,202
What's a really bad idea is to pick somebody that you think is cool for the role and then

246
00:16:24,222 --> 00:16:27,623
to cast them and they're totally not the right actor for the role.

247
00:16:29,144 --> 00:16:30,525
Uh, never happened to me.

248
00:16:33,669 --> 00:16:35,431
Also, check their experience.

249
00:16:35,932 --> 00:16:39,977
Actors, just like audio people and every other discipline, have specialties.

250
00:16:40,177 --> 00:16:43,201
I mean, a lot of times people will make the mistake of,

251
00:16:43,481 --> 00:16:47,766
and not necessarily a mistake, but it takes a very skilled director to get it done right,

252
00:16:48,247 --> 00:16:51,291
to take an on-screen actor and put them in a VO booth.

253
00:16:51,893 --> 00:16:55,196
Well, most onscreen actors have only been on a VO booth to do ADR,

254
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:57,277
which is like looping their own performances.

255
00:16:57,337 --> 00:17:01,159
They haven't done creative voice work where they're getting a picture

256
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:02,660
in their head and they're performing to it.

257
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,982
So not every TV actor or film actors can be able to do that.

258
00:17:06,022 --> 00:17:09,885
Their standard practice working is having the script that they read their pages

259
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,567
like right before they go on and then they go and they deliver their roles.

260
00:17:12,627 --> 00:17:14,528
Sometimes they read them ahead and get them.

261
00:17:14,588 --> 00:17:16,929
But that's why theatrical actors are very good.

262
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,050
for this.

263
00:17:19,611 --> 00:17:23,812
Maybe they've done some video games, but they were in Simlish

264
00:17:23,832 --> 00:17:25,193
and you're directing XCOM.

265
00:17:25,493 --> 00:17:26,413
Never happened to me.

266
00:17:28,594 --> 00:17:31,735
So just check their experience and make sure that it's right for your game.

267
00:17:33,656 --> 00:17:34,176
Let's see.

268
00:17:34,196 --> 00:17:37,217
Oh, also, you want to be aware of their availabilities, too.

269
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:39,638
So if they're doing TV or theater, make sure that they're going to be available

270
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:43,800
three days before CERT to do their pickups and not at a price in Mexico.

271
00:17:48,246 --> 00:17:50,846
So now that you've got a cast, you have to record them.

272
00:17:52,607 --> 00:17:54,107
First up, find a studio.

273
00:17:54,187 --> 00:17:56,788
I know this is really rudimentary, but I'm trying to give you guys tips

274
00:17:56,828 --> 00:17:59,888
through like really dumb ass explanations.

275
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:03,429
Find a studio that's close to your talent, not to you.

276
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:06,830
It's way cheaper to fly yourself to the studio

277
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,911
than to fly all of your talent to you.

278
00:18:10,311 --> 00:18:11,211
There's that.

279
00:18:11,971 --> 00:18:15,672
Also, surprise, Vio is not music.

280
00:18:17,632 --> 00:18:18,715
That's a weird one, right?

281
00:18:19,457 --> 00:18:19,938
What that means...

282
00:18:24,507 --> 00:18:28,547
What that means is that that beautiful studio that you have in mind with the

283
00:18:28,647 --> 00:18:34,388
Neve console and all the vintage API gear and the awesome tube microphones

284
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:37,469
and the compressors and the bells and whistles and synthesizers,

285
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:39,029
that's not your studio.

286
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:42,850
You want the cleanest most transparent signal path possible.

287
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:49,531
Find studios that have John Hardy M1s or GMLs and a U87 and that's pretty much

288
00:18:49,871 --> 00:18:52,791
it. What you also,

289
00:18:54,199 --> 00:19:00,768
On the flip side of that, there's a lot of studios that are dedicated VO studios that

290
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:07,677
have these dead, lifeless coffin rooms where talent goes to suffer and die.

291
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,121
I don't like those.

292
00:19:12,321 --> 00:19:15,863
Clearly, they usually have a pretty easy to identify.

293
00:19:15,883 --> 00:19:18,164
They have lots of pointy foam objects in them

294
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:21,006
and a 416 pointed at the actor.

295
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:24,268
Here's a good way to figure this out.

296
00:19:24,348 --> 00:19:26,109
Walk into a room, do the clap test.

297
00:19:26,589 --> 00:19:29,231
If it sounds like a clap, that's a good room.

298
00:19:29,731 --> 00:19:31,672
If it sounds like some sort of weird fart,

299
00:19:33,813 --> 00:19:35,134
don't book that studio.

300
00:19:37,935 --> 00:19:39,376
I did a fart joke at GDC.

301
00:19:39,476 --> 00:19:39,656
Again.

302
00:19:44,356 --> 00:19:45,917
Look for look for large rooms.

303
00:19:47,638 --> 00:19:48,259
It's going to help.

304
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:49,359
It's going to help with the sound.

305
00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:50,160
It's also going to help

306
00:19:51,181 --> 00:19:52,822
if you're very comfortable with the engineer.

307
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:56,224
Like I've spent a lot of years building up really good support teams.

308
00:19:56,604 --> 00:19:58,265
I direct from inside the booth.

309
00:19:58,325 --> 00:20:00,267
It really helps with the actor director relationship

310
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:02,088
to be able to give them that sort of confidence.

311
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:04,770
You know what?

312
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:05,950
Here's another good test.

313
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,291
Walk into the room.

314
00:20:08,012 --> 00:20:11,714
If it makes you feel inspired and creative and empowered.

315
00:20:12,473 --> 00:20:15,634
Guess what? It's going to help the actor to do that too.

316
00:20:16,755 --> 00:20:20,177
Amazing. I know pearls of wisdom.

317
00:20:21,357 --> 00:20:23,078
Let's talk about scripts for a second.

318
00:20:23,398 --> 00:20:25,299
We're going to go on a metaphor adventure here.

319
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,661
Let's say you have a favorite tool that you like to work with.

320
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:31,262
We'll use a screwdriver for this metaphor, right?

321
00:20:31,442 --> 00:20:33,103
Every day you go to work, you use a screwdriver.

322
00:20:33,403 --> 00:20:35,905
You are really, really good at screwing.

323
00:20:36,865 --> 00:20:39,766
Now, let's say you get hired for, oh, should I rewrote that?

324
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:45,032
Now let's say you get hired for a job and your new boss says,

325
00:20:45,352 --> 00:20:48,053
Oh buddy, we don't use screwdrivers here, but here's a hammer.

326
00:20:48,073 --> 00:20:50,594
Uh, you know, use on those screws.

327
00:20:51,615 --> 00:20:56,417
Uh, same thing happens when we give Excel spreadsheets to actors.

328
00:20:57,117 --> 00:20:59,498
We're used to seeing theatrically formatted scripts.

329
00:21:00,576 --> 00:21:02,317
Man, does that blow a session?

330
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:03,157
They won't tell you.

331
00:21:03,257 --> 00:21:05,458
Actors will not tell you what makes them uncomfortable in the booth.

332
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:08,919
They're happy to be there and they will do anything in their power to please you.

333
00:21:09,939 --> 00:21:15,161
So it's your job to learn about acting and to and to make them comfortable.

334
00:21:15,681 --> 00:21:19,426
One more thing, when you give them their beautifully theatrically formatted scripts,

335
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:26,774
for god's sake, put the previous line and some context into the scripts so the actors can read

336
00:21:26,794 --> 00:21:33,402
it and get it in their hands at least two days before the session if you can. Even if it's dry,

337
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:36,405
like mocked copy, get it in their hands. It'll help.

338
00:21:37,402 --> 00:21:40,523
Alright, for working with talent, you need to remember a few golden rules.

339
00:21:41,143 --> 00:21:45,544
Actors, surprisingly, are neither parrots nor magicians.

340
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,305
Except for some of the magicians that I work with. ...

341
00:21:52,647 --> 00:21:57,729
The best way to break an actor, and not in like a stallion sort of way,

342
00:21:57,769 --> 00:22:00,070
just more of a sad, broken person sort of way...

343
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:08,609
is to beat them down at every nuance of their performance to get it the way that it sounds

344
00:22:08,689 --> 00:22:16,617
in your head. You hired professionals to collaborate with, listen to them, trust them, but on the

345
00:22:16,657 --> 00:22:17,197
flip side...

346
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,873
They're not working on the game nearly as closely as you are.

347
00:22:21,453 --> 00:22:24,356
You're going to need to give them context and direction.

348
00:22:25,418 --> 00:22:27,220
Come to my talk on Thursday at 11,

349
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:31,264
and I'll give you a master class in directing

350
00:22:31,324 --> 00:22:32,085
if you're interested.

351
00:22:32,165 --> 00:22:34,027
But basically, really quick.

352
00:22:34,648 --> 00:22:36,410
Give the actors some time to get the line right.

353
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:39,353
If they don't get it on the first try, give them two more.

354
00:22:39,653 --> 00:22:42,636
And if they don't get it on the third one, give them a little help.

355
00:22:43,076 --> 00:22:43,797
An adjective.

356
00:22:44,117 --> 00:22:47,080
It's not until the fourth or fifth that you really want to get in there

357
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,182
and be like, OK, let's figure out what's going on,

358
00:22:49,563 --> 00:22:52,245
especially if it's a short, long line, then clearly help them out.

359
00:22:52,385 --> 00:22:55,008
But yeah, just give the actors some space to do their jobs.

360
00:22:56,228 --> 00:23:03,132
So on that point, your job in the studio as a director or as a session runner is to create

361
00:23:03,232 --> 00:23:04,954
a bubble around the actor.

362
00:23:05,774 --> 00:23:11,378
Your job is to protect them from the producer and the writer and the engineer and the coffee

363
00:23:11,418 --> 00:23:13,479
person and the script person and everybody else.

364
00:23:13,579 --> 00:23:15,721
That's your job to deal with them.

365
00:23:16,321 --> 00:23:17,722
You are running the session.

366
00:23:18,643 --> 00:23:19,203
You are not.

367
00:23:20,244 --> 00:23:24,730
there to make the actor uncomfortable by making them privy to all of that.

368
00:23:25,431 --> 00:23:30,178
That said, what that doesn't mean is take the talkback loop off.

369
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,302
Because what happens when you take the talkback loop off?

370
00:23:34,905 --> 00:23:37,088
The actor is now in isolation.

371
00:23:45,972 --> 00:23:49,273
This is what the actor sees on the other side of the glass, and you're saying,

372
00:23:49,533 --> 00:23:51,113
I don't want meatballs for lunch.

373
00:23:51,213 --> 00:23:52,274
We had it yesterday.

374
00:23:52,294 --> 00:23:53,854
I want to, yeah.

375
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,055
That's pretty much what happens in a studio.

376
00:23:56,095 --> 00:23:57,275
Or, did you see that YouTube clip?

377
00:23:57,295 --> 00:23:58,175
I know, it was crazy.

378
00:23:58,275 --> 00:23:58,995
What is he thinking?

379
00:24:00,196 --> 00:24:03,336
The actor will immediately think, oh my god, this guy's terrible.

380
00:24:03,376 --> 00:24:04,157
Why did we hire him?

381
00:24:04,337 --> 00:24:05,837
Get him out of the booth as fast as possible.

382
00:24:06,117 --> 00:24:06,377
That's.

383
00:24:07,683 --> 00:24:10,065
After psychology for you, I okay now I lost my place.

384
00:24:10,085 --> 00:24:10,886
I went on a tangent.

385
00:24:11,406 --> 00:24:11,886
It happens.

386
00:24:12,127 --> 00:24:13,107
Go on this trip with me, man.

387
00:24:13,127 --> 00:24:14,529
All right.

388
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:18,051
Lastly, have a vision for what you want your game to sound like

389
00:24:18,152 --> 00:24:19,453
and communicate it effectively.

390
00:24:19,493 --> 00:24:22,055
I know it sounds stupid, but you can go either way with this.

391
00:24:22,095 --> 00:24:23,896
You can have no idea what you want your game to sound like.

392
00:24:23,956 --> 00:24:24,477
I don't know.

393
00:24:24,517 --> 00:24:25,538
The Raider wanted something.

394
00:24:25,818 --> 00:24:26,618
Read your scripts, man.

395
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:27,239
Have a vision.

396
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:27,819
That's you.

397
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:29,241
You're a creative professional.

398
00:24:29,661 --> 00:24:30,101
Jesus.

399
00:24:33,484 --> 00:24:34,665
That's that's stump.

400
00:24:34,845 --> 00:24:35,966
That's me on my stump.

401
00:24:36,106 --> 00:24:36,226
OK.

402
00:24:37,545 --> 00:24:40,567
All right, lastly, if all this seems really daunting,

403
00:24:40,607 --> 00:24:43,549
there's a plethora of professionals that are here at your beck and call.

404
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:45,951
Even if you want to just call up and ask for some advice,

405
00:24:46,431 --> 00:24:48,532
most of us are really approachable human beings.

406
00:24:49,273 --> 00:24:51,634
Some of us have even worked in-house at game studios before.

407
00:24:52,055 --> 00:24:55,196
There's voice directors who will come in and work with your talent with you if

408
00:24:55,236 --> 00:24:56,997
you're uncomfortable having that relationship.

409
00:24:57,217 --> 00:24:59,738
There's casting directors that will find awesome talent for you.

410
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:04,020
Voice production houses that will do soup to nuts script supervisors that

411
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,761
will come and help you groom your scripts and get them treated for the

412
00:25:06,962 --> 00:25:10,003
for the studio editorial and mastery engineers.

413
00:25:10,023 --> 00:25:13,104
We're going to get it to sound way better than you will most of you.

414
00:25:13,164 --> 00:25:14,565
I don't know what your skill level is.

415
00:25:15,705 --> 00:25:16,406
That's basically it.

416
00:25:16,826 --> 00:25:19,647
That's my talk. I wanted to leave room for Q&A. We've got a couple minutes.

417
00:25:20,207 --> 00:25:21,327
Let's get some questions going.

418
00:25:21,727 --> 00:25:25,488
Please line up at the microphone. You can pretty much ask me anything.

419
00:25:26,508 --> 00:25:30,369
Everyone is invited to talk and ask questions, including the CAs,

420
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:34,390
who I know are just jumping at the bit to ask me to shut up.

421
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:41,011
On that note, please don't forget to thank your volunteers and fill out your surveys.

422
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:45,852
I recommend high-fiving CAs at any point you get, unless they're weird about hand stuff.

423
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:52,376
Um, lastly, just to plug my own thing, uh, at the, at the, uh, if you're wanting more

424
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:55,018
boots on the ground, look at actually like running sessions.

425
00:25:55,098 --> 00:25:57,840
Come to my talk on Thursday where I basically turn this room.

426
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:02,243
Well, not this room, turn the room into a live recording situation.

427
00:26:02,283 --> 00:26:03,464
It's called VO session live.

428
00:26:03,784 --> 00:26:04,864
I show the pro tools rig.

429
00:26:04,904 --> 00:26:08,147
I show you how we pull down takes and we have volunteers from the audience come up and run

430
00:26:08,187 --> 00:26:09,227
different scripts scenarios.

431
00:26:09,728 --> 00:26:10,088
Thank you.

432
00:26:10,128 --> 00:26:10,508
That was me.

433
00:26:20,699 --> 00:26:21,399
Hi, first question.

434
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,521
Hi, I was curious, specifically as you were talking about

435
00:26:27,682 --> 00:26:29,382
being in the studio with the talent,

436
00:26:31,063 --> 00:26:33,144
any thoughts or extra wisdom you might have

437
00:26:33,264 --> 00:26:35,425
for dialogue or group talk sessions

438
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:38,426
where you may want to have multiple actors, if possible,

439
00:26:38,586 --> 00:26:41,307
in the same space so that they can riff off of each other

440
00:26:41,387 --> 00:26:41,907
on their lines?

441
00:26:42,227 --> 00:26:43,448
I absolutely recommend it.

442
00:26:43,548 --> 00:26:46,488
Anytime you have two characters in your video game that talk to each other.

443
00:26:46,508 --> 00:26:49,869
And if you want a very detailed explanation of that, either revisit

444
00:26:49,929 --> 00:26:54,230
the talks I've done in the past, that detailed ensemble voice production,

445
00:26:54,651 --> 00:26:57,851
or come to the talk on Thursday where I'm going to run through ensemble scripts

446
00:26:57,911 --> 00:26:59,792
and show you exactly how to do just that.

447
00:27:00,272 --> 00:27:01,212
Thank you for that. Awesome.

448
00:27:01,352 --> 00:27:03,593
Good call. Thursday, three o'clock. Hi.

449
00:27:04,453 --> 00:27:05,393
Hi. My question is.

450
00:27:05,593 --> 00:27:09,194
11 o'clock. Sorry.

451
00:27:09,414 --> 00:27:09,875
1130, whatever it says.

452
00:27:11,735 --> 00:27:15,018
My question is when you have been working in an indie game

453
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:17,120
and you have no budget and they're forcing you

454
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,041
the sound person to be the actor as well.

455
00:27:20,642 --> 00:27:23,545
How do you prepare to that if you have no experience

456
00:27:23,605 --> 00:27:24,465
in voice acting at all?

457
00:27:25,026 --> 00:27:27,028
If you have no experience in voice acting at all

458
00:27:27,808 --> 00:27:30,430
and you have no budget and you are also expected

459
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:33,533
to be the voice talent, was that the yes?

460
00:27:34,553 --> 00:27:35,594
Then the behemoth do that.

461
00:27:35,614 --> 00:27:38,276
And then didn't that come out freaking awesome?

462
00:27:39,297 --> 00:27:40,578
Yeah. Do the best job you can, man.

463
00:27:42,762 --> 00:27:46,084
I'd so so my right I'm sorry that was a really dumb answer

464
00:27:50,366 --> 00:27:56,450
so two tips on acting one just lose all your inhibitions like seriously just

465
00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:00,112
just throw them out because they're useless in the studio all of them and

466
00:28:00,172 --> 00:28:06,076
secondly if if you want there are totally awesome resources for for for

467
00:28:06,116 --> 00:28:08,757
learning acting in your where you live

468
00:28:09,918 --> 00:28:10,338
Columbia

469
00:28:11,213 --> 00:28:14,095
Cool. I don't know about Columbia. I'm guessing that there are...

470
00:28:15,295 --> 00:28:15,815
There are none.

471
00:28:16,235 --> 00:28:21,817
Okay. Uh, do you don't have like, you don't have like a local theater or, uh, or, or actors?

472
00:28:22,017 --> 00:28:24,778
Have you seen soap operas? Have you seen our soap operas?

473
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:25,599
Si.

474
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,080
They're bad. They're absolutely horrible.

475
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,621
Si, tu es emperzar. Woo!

476
00:28:33,442 --> 00:28:34,742
It is exactly like that.

477
00:28:34,762 --> 00:28:36,323
I don't know what that means, but man, is it funny.

478
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,880
Alright, um, come talk to me in the wrap-up room and I'll give you some actual...

479
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,241
Sorry.

480
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,041
Awesome, thank you so much.

481
00:28:43,502 --> 00:28:45,983
Hey, I don't know if this is too personal of a question, but...

482
00:28:46,323 --> 00:28:50,385
Like, all throughout the talk you seem to have these little bouts of vitriol,

483
00:28:50,425 --> 00:28:52,706
just like, the random crap that happens to you.

484
00:28:53,126 --> 00:28:56,028
I'm wondering in particular, like, what is the worst...

485
00:28:56,828 --> 00:29:00,390
Like, snafu that's happened in your career that you can think of off the top of your head?

486
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,812
Actor showed up at 9 o'clock in the morning high out of her fucking mind,

487
00:29:03,832 --> 00:29:05,713
but she was a celebrity and there was nothing we could do about it.

488
00:29:11,662 --> 00:29:12,922
And so she was there for four hours?

489
00:29:13,183 --> 00:29:14,443
And she had to do combat that day.

490
00:29:14,823 --> 00:29:16,404
Oh, God!

491
00:29:18,526 --> 00:29:18,806
Great.

492
00:29:19,726 --> 00:29:20,267
Best of luck.

493
00:29:22,708 --> 00:29:22,988
John.

494
00:29:23,008 --> 00:29:23,528
Hello.

495
00:29:24,109 --> 00:29:28,691
OK, so we've talked a lot about recording in a studio,

496
00:29:28,711 --> 00:29:32,173
but say you're working on a project that's a very, very low budget project

497
00:29:32,594 --> 00:29:36,636
and you have to work with actors who are remote, who have their own home studios.

498
00:29:36,676 --> 00:29:38,837
What kind of advice would you offer in a situation like that?

499
00:29:47,047 --> 00:29:54,969
Firstly, I would have them do test audio with their auditions from their recording environment to make sure their recording environment is

500
00:29:55,509 --> 00:30:03,431
is compatible with the other actors that you have that you have gotten to work on your project. Secondly, you can do low-budget

501
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:05,532
even no budget

502
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,153
auditioning in within one city.

503
00:30:10,293 --> 00:30:13,254
Pick one and do it or pick two if you're bold.

504
00:30:15,175 --> 00:30:21,537
I would point out that most actor a lot of actors in major cities like LA, New York, Chicago

505
00:30:22,177 --> 00:30:29,139
They have personal home recording studios. They're pretty okay if they don't and you really love them you could always

506
00:30:29,459 --> 00:30:35,321
broach the subject of maybe we can do better with your recording setup and maybe send them some articles on how to set up a

507
00:30:35,361 --> 00:30:37,981
little blanket fort to record in so

508
00:30:39,242 --> 00:30:42,063
That's the best I can offer man. Sure. Yes. Thank you very much cool

509
00:30:43,543 --> 00:30:45,984
I am done, but I will be in the wrap-up room.

510
00:30:46,004 --> 00:30:50,887
Uh, so please come visit me in the wrap-up room, or else I will feel lonely and it's

511
00:30:50,927 --> 00:30:54,189
cold in there, and the more people that get there, the more BTUs we shed, and the more

512
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:54,649
we can hug.

513
00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:54,729
Bye!
