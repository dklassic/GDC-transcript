1
00:00:02,428 --> 00:00:08,051
All right. So my name is Chris Reed. I'm an indie game lawyer. I don't bite, though. And

2
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:12,033
this is Practical Law 101 for indie devs. Not scary edition.

3
00:00:13,437 --> 00:00:16,638
So my love of games started when I was about five years old,

4
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:19,700
watching my brother play Ultima III and Zork

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,060
on our family's Apple IIe.

6
00:00:21,441 --> 00:00:24,082
And then, like an older brother, he turned around and threatened

7
00:00:24,142 --> 00:00:27,023
me at fist point to sign this contract, which

8
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:29,365
my parents preserved, which says that I will pay him

9
00:00:29,565 --> 00:00:32,266
all my current cash supply if I broke one of the 5 and 1

10
00:00:32,586 --> 00:00:33,987
1⁄4 inch floppies with the games on them.

11
00:00:34,836 --> 00:00:36,498
Not a very good game contract.

12
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:40,081
So it's not a surprise that a couple of decades later,

13
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:42,483
I ended up with my own law practice,

14
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,565
where I work with indie game developers and people

15
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:46,806
in the game space to help them with basically

16
00:00:46,827 --> 00:00:47,767
all their legal issues.

17
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:49,969
I'm proud to announce that we've just

18
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:51,390
hired our first paralegal.

19
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,312
I just spoke with him on the phone.

20
00:00:53,332 --> 00:00:54,713
He's having a little bit of trouble

21
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:56,755
with the billing software, but hopefully he'll get it.

22
00:00:58,234 --> 00:01:00,416
With the help of my co-counsel, Mr. Phoenix Wright,

23
00:01:00,616 --> 00:01:02,418
I want to make a quick disclaimer, which

24
00:01:02,498 --> 00:01:04,840
is that I am not your lawyer, unless I am.

25
00:01:05,961 --> 00:01:09,224
And this presentation is legal education, not legal advice,

26
00:01:09,484 --> 00:01:10,665
but I do hope you learn something.

27
00:01:12,066 --> 00:01:14,348
My goal today is to help all of you

28
00:01:14,628 --> 00:01:17,531
identify and avoid common legal pitfalls.

29
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:21,654
So we've got.

30
00:01:22,965 --> 00:01:23,565
Not a lot of time.

31
00:01:23,705 --> 00:01:25,487
And the time that it would take to go over everything

32
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:29,049
that I think is important is about this long.

33
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,492
Unfortunately, as you know, we have about enough time

34
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,393
for a game of Hearthstone.

35
00:01:35,014 --> 00:01:35,494
Maybe two.

36
00:01:35,514 --> 00:01:36,855
I think that's mage aggro.

37
00:01:37,175 --> 00:01:37,796
I haven't played in a while.

38
00:01:38,696 --> 00:01:41,438
So we're going to cover five topics, creating a company,

39
00:01:41,798 --> 00:01:44,300
contracts, intellectual property, infringement,

40
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:45,621
and privacy.

41
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:47,863
For each topic, I'm going to tell you

42
00:01:48,023 --> 00:01:50,325
why you should care, when you should care,

43
00:01:50,345 --> 00:01:51,966
and what you need to know about it.

44
00:01:53,455 --> 00:01:56,876
So first topic is creating a company.

45
00:01:57,156 --> 00:01:59,777
And by a company, I mean the legal corporate entity.

46
00:02:01,158 --> 00:02:02,238
Why should you care about this?

47
00:02:02,598 --> 00:02:05,239
Well, a company is sort of like the legal equivalent

48
00:02:05,339 --> 00:02:06,460
of a suit of power armor.

49
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,501
It protects you and gives you cool abilities.

50
00:02:09,561 --> 00:02:11,842
Some of these include limited liability.

51
00:02:12,242 --> 00:02:14,783
This means that if there are debts or liabilities

52
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,644
that you incur in business, they only stick to the company.

53
00:02:17,684 --> 00:02:19,705
That's all that's at risk, not your personal assets,

54
00:02:19,745 --> 00:02:20,765
which can be very important.

55
00:02:21,858 --> 00:02:32,601
It also acts as a convenient bucket for intellectual property, meaning that you can assign all the rights in the game from the individuals who create the pieces of the game to the company.

56
00:02:32,641 --> 00:02:34,661
It's all in one place. The company can then license it.

57
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:39,102
It's a convenient way to share ownership and profits in the company.

58
00:02:39,723 --> 00:02:42,943
It's the way that you figure out who owns what and how voting is handled.

59
00:02:43,975 --> 00:02:45,036
There are tax reasons.

60
00:02:45,076 --> 00:02:46,997
We won't get into them because I don't do tax,

61
00:02:47,037 --> 00:02:48,658
but you should talk to your accountant.

62
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:51,921
Finally, on a sort of practical note,

63
00:02:52,301 --> 00:02:53,922
having a corporate entity enables

64
00:02:53,942 --> 00:02:56,143
you to be taken more seriously when business dealings.

65
00:02:56,204 --> 00:02:59,926
Most people expect to be dealing with an actual company

66
00:02:59,986 --> 00:03:01,187
and not with a group of people who

67
00:03:01,227 --> 00:03:03,148
are individuals calling themselves a studio.

68
00:03:04,215 --> 00:03:08,355
So when do you need to be thinking about this? Ideally, before you start working at all.

69
00:03:09,176 --> 00:03:12,816
But let's be realistic, that's probably not what's going to happen. So realistically,

70
00:03:13,196 --> 00:03:17,097
you should put this together round about the time that you start to get serious, meaning

71
00:03:17,457 --> 00:03:22,518
putting in a significant amount of time or money into the project in your game. And the

72
00:03:22,598 --> 00:03:26,159
latest at which you should do this and put together a company is probably before you

73
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:30,160
enter into agreements with other people, either cofounders or you start hiring people.

74
00:03:31,762 --> 00:03:33,504
So what should we know about putting together a company?

75
00:03:34,626 --> 00:03:35,487
There's a couple of things you want

76
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:38,150
to discuss with your co-founders or with yourself

77
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,992
if you're doing it solo.

78
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:43,256
First off, whether there's going to be any future investment.

79
00:03:43,296 --> 00:03:45,439
Now, this may not be the case for a lot of indies,

80
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,061
but some people do eventually end up

81
00:03:47,181 --> 00:03:48,322
seeking some outside money.

82
00:03:48,382 --> 00:03:50,224
And knowing about that in the future

83
00:03:50,285 --> 00:03:50,645
lets you

84
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,827
make certain decisions in how you structure things.

85
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:58,568
You need to know who owns and controls the company.

86
00:03:58,608 --> 00:04:00,249
So what are the percentages of ownership

87
00:04:00,289 --> 00:04:01,929
of people who are actual founders?

88
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:04,390
And not everyone working on it has to be an equity owner.

89
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,970
We'll get to that.

90
00:04:06,471 --> 00:04:08,071
And how is voting handled?

91
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:09,712
How do you make decisions in your company?

92
00:04:10,072 --> 00:04:11,292
These are things you want to discuss

93
00:04:11,312 --> 00:04:12,813
and be clear on before you proceed.

94
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:17,015
There's a technical thing you're going to have to choose, which is the type of entity.

95
00:04:17,095 --> 00:04:18,456
It's mostly a tax issue.

96
00:04:18,736 --> 00:04:19,897
There are a few differences.

97
00:04:19,977 --> 00:04:24,840
Just be aware you'll have to make this choice before you go and file to create the entity.

98
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,422
And this is the step where you fill out some paperwork.

99
00:04:27,822 --> 00:04:29,503
It gets sent to the state usually.

100
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:30,844
And there's a fee.

101
00:04:31,224 --> 00:04:34,446
And this is when the company becomes a real legal entity.

102
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:36,047
That means you can go start your bank account.

103
00:04:36,388 --> 00:04:38,989
You can sign contracts on behalf of the company.

104
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,031
It's now, it comes into existence.

105
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:42,091
But that's not the end.

106
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:48,036
The last thing you want to do is draft an operating agreement or a shareholder's agreement.

107
00:04:48,136 --> 00:04:52,260
This is the document where all those things you discussed either in your own head or with

108
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,105
your cofounders get put down in writing and agreed to formally. This is important to have

109
00:04:57,145 --> 00:05:05,053
in place, even if you're a solo, a single member LLC. So companies, form one, form one early.

110
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,912
Our next issue is contracts. And I guarantee you that as indie developers you are going to

111
00:05:11,952 --> 00:05:18,396
encounter at least one contract. So why should you care about contracts?

112
00:05:19,597 --> 00:05:21,797
Contracts provide clarity and predictability

113
00:05:22,218 --> 00:05:23,278
in any business relationship.

114
00:05:23,298 --> 00:05:24,018
It's like the rule book.

115
00:05:24,498 --> 00:05:26,959
People can go and look and see exactly what the rules are

116
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:27,659
and how it works.

117
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,661
The simple fact of sitting down to talk about a contract

118
00:05:31,701 --> 00:05:33,301
and negotiate it tends to make people

119
00:05:33,461 --> 00:05:34,902
think through more issues than they would have,

120
00:05:34,922 --> 00:05:36,963
which means that you're less likely to end up in a fight

121
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,483
if you've really discussed this stuff.

122
00:05:39,764 --> 00:05:41,324
And having it signed and in place

123
00:05:41,364 --> 00:05:42,085
protects you against.

124
00:05:42,904 --> 00:05:47,225
the worst case scenario and the best case. By that I mean obviously if things go wrong,

125
00:05:47,285 --> 00:05:51,326
having the contract is good, you know what the rules are. But it's also the case that

126
00:05:51,366 --> 00:05:55,827
sometimes things can go very right and you have sudden unexpected success and people who

127
00:05:55,847 --> 00:05:59,267
said, yeah, it's cool, it's free, you can use that asset. Now that there's money involved,

128
00:05:59,327 --> 00:06:03,148
they don't feel that way. So you want to have that contract in place before that point

129
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:09,649
comes. Finally, certain things require a written contract to accomplish. For your purposes,

130
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:12,490
we're talking about transferring intellectual property.

131
00:06:13,897 --> 00:06:18,940
All right. So when do you want to think about contracts? Repeat after me. Before you do

132
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:25,703
anything with anyone. I couldn't be more clear about this. But I think I will be more clear

133
00:06:25,743 --> 00:06:31,206
about this. Before any of the following things, which is a big scary list, feel free to snap

134
00:06:31,246 --> 00:06:36,268
a photo, but it's in the vault. We're going to be talking today about two specific types

135
00:06:36,308 --> 00:06:40,250
of contracts that I think are important. The independent contractor or work for hire agreement

136
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,131
and publishing agreements.

137
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,011
So what do we want to know about contracts?

138
00:06:45,612 --> 00:06:49,834
Well, in general, there are certain clauses that come up in most contracts, and you should

139
00:06:49,874 --> 00:06:50,494
be aware of them.

140
00:06:51,715 --> 00:06:53,136
The term and termination clause.

141
00:06:53,356 --> 00:06:55,537
This means, how long does it last?

142
00:06:56,117 --> 00:06:57,058
How do you get out of it?

143
00:06:57,258 --> 00:06:59,199
What happens when it gets terminated?

144
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:00,420
Who pays whom what?

145
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,340
How is it calculated?

146
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,381
Speaking of who pays whom.

147
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:09,756
it's important to know what people are getting paid. Not just how much, but how, on what

148
00:07:09,816 --> 00:07:13,780
time frame, how it's calculated. There's a lot of flexibility within these. I've seen all

149
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:20,668
sorts of stuff, hourly, hourly with a cap, a flat fee, milestones, a revenue share and a

150
00:07:20,728 --> 00:07:25,393
combination of these. But what's important is it be defined clearly so that both sides know

151
00:07:25,973 --> 00:07:26,554
how it works.

152
00:07:27,431 --> 00:07:32,197
And speaking of defining things clearly, you want to also define the services and deliverables.

153
00:07:32,277 --> 00:07:35,361
This means the things that each side has promised to do.

154
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:39,707
So services they're going to provide or something they're going to create, like an art asset

155
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:41,009
or a soundtrack.

156
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,294
You want it to be very clear what it is, not just some music for the game.

157
00:07:47,202 --> 00:07:51,184
There's also a section in most contracts called warranties and indemnification that most people

158
00:07:51,224 --> 00:07:56,006
just sort of skip over because it looks weird. This is where each side makes a promise to

159
00:07:56,046 --> 00:08:00,267
the other about certain things that they're saying are true, and then the indemnification

160
00:08:00,327 --> 00:08:03,969
is where you say, and if it's not true, then I'm the one on the hook. Practically, what

161
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:06,830
does this mean for you? That means usually things like

162
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:11,993
promising that you didn't steal the IP, it's original work and someone is not going to sue

163
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:16,915
them if they use it. And if they do sue them, you promise to be on the hook. This is the

164
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:20,797
section where you can take on a lot of liability. So it's important to know what you're

165
00:08:20,817 --> 00:08:25,820
promising and make sure that it's true. Finally, there's a couple other terms that end up at

166
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,382
the end of most contracts, where you end up getting sued, whether you can talk about the

167
00:08:29,582 --> 00:08:34,544
contract or the terms of it, and whether you might be stopped from competing or bringing

168
00:08:34,604 --> 00:08:36,605
along employees from someone that you work for.

169
00:08:37,757 --> 00:08:42,880
So let's move on to one of the two types of common contracts that I think you're very likely to

170
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,803
encounter. This one is called the work for hire agreement or sometimes known as the independent

171
00:08:46,883 --> 00:08:52,787
contractor agreement. It is between the developer and the contractor. The contractor could be

172
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:57,931
anyone who's contributing something to the game, a coder, an artist, a sound person, and it

173
00:08:57,951 --> 00:09:01,313
could even be a company that's providing that sort of services as a company.

174
00:09:03,092 --> 00:09:05,634
So what do you need to know about work for hire agreements?

175
00:09:06,095 --> 00:09:08,117
A couple of specific terms that are important.

176
00:09:09,118 --> 00:09:10,779
First off, they're called work for hire

177
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:13,301
because this is the agreement where

178
00:09:13,321 --> 00:09:17,365
you assign the IP rights from the contractor to the company.

179
00:09:17,405 --> 00:09:18,826
We talked about a bucket for IP.

180
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:20,307
This is how you take those rights

181
00:09:20,367 --> 00:09:22,469
and put them in the bucket so that the company

182
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:23,530
owns all the rights.

183
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,332
It's very important to have that in place.

184
00:09:25,372 --> 00:09:27,313
It creates what's called a work for hire arrangement.

185
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:34,553
You also want to be very clear as the developer how you're paying them. And as we said, a lot of

186
00:09:34,593 --> 00:09:41,136
flexibility here, but make sure that it's clear. They may ask for some up front afterwards. Just

187
00:09:41,316 --> 00:09:45,138
make sure that you know. And if it's a revenue share, just make sure it's defined properly.

188
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:51,132
You also want to define, again, the scope of work. This is tied to the deliverables. You want

189
00:09:51,172 --> 00:09:56,935
to make it clear what's expected. You don't just say the soundtrack. You say, you know, up to

190
00:09:57,015 --> 00:10:02,738
a minimum of six minutes of music with whatever, you know, technical specifications. You

191
00:10:02,758 --> 00:10:09,261
don't have to go into perfect detail, but it needs to be not vague. Finally, you want to know

192
00:10:09,461 --> 00:10:13,383
about how you can get out of the contract. For a work for hire agreement, this usually

193
00:10:13,443 --> 00:10:15,024
means what happens if you just...

194
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:19,662
not feeling the art and you want to let them go, you need someone else. Well, you need to

195
00:10:19,742 --> 00:10:23,204
know, this is, you normally wouldn't be able to get out of the contract unless your

196
00:10:23,244 --> 00:10:28,547
termination section has a right for the company to terminate for convenience. And if it

197
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:32,630
does, well, then the other side is going to want to know, hey, what do I get paid? What

198
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:36,152
happens when I get terminated? Is there a kill fee? Think about these things.

199
00:10:37,312 --> 00:10:41,736
The next type of agreement, and this is a very wide range of types of agreements, but it would be a

200
00:10:41,816 --> 00:10:46,760
development or a publishing agreement. A lot of indies, even if they develop on their own, might

201
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:51,584
consider going to a publisher for things like marketing, or it may be an old school agreement

202
00:10:51,644 --> 00:10:59,111
where they kicked in money up front. This is between the publisher and the developer. Don't tease

203
00:10:59,151 --> 00:11:04,075
the octopus kids. So what do you need to know about development and publishing agreements?

204
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:06,045
Couple of familiar faces.

205
00:11:06,385 --> 00:11:06,965
IP rights.

206
00:11:07,325 --> 00:11:08,786
In this case, you're the developer.

207
00:11:09,006 --> 00:11:12,346
So you want to think, am I assigning and selling

208
00:11:12,586 --> 00:11:14,787
all the rights, the IP rights, to my game?

209
00:11:14,847 --> 00:11:16,627
Or am I simply licensing them to the publisher

210
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:17,327
if they're distributing?

211
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:19,808
And if I'm licensing, that's not just one thing.

212
00:11:19,828 --> 00:11:22,489
There's a difference between licensing in one country

213
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:25,649
on one platform for a year and licensing worldwide

214
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:26,829
on all platforms forever.

215
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,530
So you need to read that and know what you're actually

216
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,070
licensing.

217
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,873
Because you're the one getting paid, it's doubly important to know how that works. In a

218
00:11:34,933 --> 00:11:39,656
publishing arrangement, usually there's some kind of revenue share agreement. And that

219
00:11:39,696 --> 00:11:44,299
means you should know how revenue is defined, what kind of things are deducted before you

220
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:50,823
make that split, and you should know if there's any kind of recoupment where the publisher

221
00:11:50,964 --> 00:11:54,286
takes, you know, makes back their money before you see a dime. All these things, it

222
00:11:54,306 --> 00:11:58,269
shouldn't be one sentence. It should be a detailed section. So if it looks short, you

223
00:11:58,289 --> 00:11:59,389
should be worried. It's vague.

224
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,102
Next, I want you all to be aware of scope creep. This comes up in the context of when you as a

225
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:09,865
studio are being hired to make someone for someone else, which isn't always, but if it's the

226
00:12:09,905 --> 00:12:14,507
case, you can have a situation where you've agreed to do it for a certain budget and they keep

227
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:19,330
asking for changes and changes and changes and new features. You want the ability to say, this

228
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:23,372
increases the scope of what I agreed to, you need to pay me more or we're not doing it. But you

229
00:12:23,392 --> 00:12:25,513
need that right in the contract or you can't say that.

230
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:30,354
Another thing that comes up often with publishing agreements are what are called derivative

231
00:12:30,394 --> 00:12:34,397
works. These mean things that are based on your game. So for your purposes, that means

232
00:12:34,477 --> 00:12:39,961
prequels, sequels, DLC, but can also mean any type of merchandising, you know, candy,

233
00:12:40,321 --> 00:12:46,466
plush toys, whatever, and also things like adaptations, comics, movies. This can be quite

234
00:12:46,526 --> 00:12:50,889
lucrative and a big deal depending on how the story of your brand goes, and sometimes

235
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:54,912
these end up in a publishing agreement where you're agreeing to just give them, oh,

236
00:12:55,352 --> 00:12:57,994
and 30% of all the derivative works, as if that's nothing.

237
00:12:58,334 --> 00:13:00,175
Make sure you decide whether or not

238
00:13:00,215 --> 00:13:03,458
it makes sense for your publisher to be involved,

239
00:13:04,058 --> 00:13:07,240
and who's making the decisions about these derivative works,

240
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,541
and who's going to pay to develop them.

241
00:13:10,522 --> 00:13:13,184
Finally, yet again, make sure you know

242
00:13:13,224 --> 00:13:15,165
how to get out of a bad deal.

243
00:13:16,521 --> 00:13:21,706
you want a termination clause that enables you to leave if things aren't going well. A

244
00:13:21,746 --> 00:13:25,509
practical way to do that, either you have a limited term, so that's only for two years and

245
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:29,753
then you can decide, or if it goes longer, you might want a clause that says, look, you need to

246
00:13:29,793 --> 00:13:36,378
meet Mr. Publisher, Mrs. Publisher, I'd like you guys to meet a minimum amount of money that

247
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:39,661
you're going to make me in the first year, and if you don't hit that, I get to take my ball and

248
00:13:39,701 --> 00:13:41,803
go home. I could do it better myself or with someone else.

249
00:13:43,062 --> 00:13:47,267
So, contracts are everywhere. We only covered two of the main types because we don't have a lot

250
00:13:47,287 --> 00:13:54,014
of time, but make sure to read them and the terms are important. Our next topic is intellectual

251
00:13:54,054 --> 00:13:57,057
property, which I'm sure you've heard of and we've already mentioned it a bit. So let's get

252
00:13:57,097 --> 00:13:57,838
into some details.

253
00:13:59,158 --> 00:14:03,582
There are a bunch of types of intellectual property, but for indie developers, I think by far the

254
00:14:03,622 --> 00:14:09,026
most relevant on a practical level are copyright and trademarks. There's a few others that can

255
00:14:09,066 --> 00:14:12,269
come up, but they're very unlikely and we're not going to go over them much. Patents are

256
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:16,593
things like novel software algorithms, maybe if it's a physical thing. They're very

257
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:19,235
expensive to get. They might be narrow in terms of the protection.

258
00:14:20,216 --> 00:14:24,917
trade secrets are things like customer lists, pricing models, things that you keep secret for business

259
00:14:24,937 --> 00:14:29,478
advantage, and right of publicity is when you deal with the name and likeness of a celebrity or a

260
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,380
public figure. So, why should you care about intellectual property? Well, it turns out that

261
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:40,782
there might be a few parts of your game that involve intellectual property, like, say, yeah,

262
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:47,204
like all of it, basically, with one very important exception that we're going to discuss. So,

263
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:54,309
Moving on, when should you be thinking about an electoral property? You should be thinking

264
00:14:54,349 --> 00:14:58,471
about an electoral property as far as copyright goes before it is created, and this is where

265
00:14:58,511 --> 00:15:02,393
we need to go back to those work for hire agreements, get those in place, then let the

266
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:07,375
person start working, ideally. Don't do it ten months later. And when the game is released,

267
00:15:07,635 --> 00:15:11,917
you should consider registering your copyright. This is not compulsory. You don't have to

268
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:16,660
do this, but it's helpful and it's cheap. For trademarks, you should think about registering

269
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:16,840
them.

270
00:15:17,922 --> 00:15:22,324
and thinking about them before launch, meaning that before you choose your name and design a

271
00:15:22,364 --> 00:15:26,025
sweet logo, you should do a little bit of research. At least run a Google search. Make sure

272
00:15:26,045 --> 00:15:30,788
there isn't some other game out there called Overwatch. Oops. Yeah. It's important. You can

273
00:15:30,808 --> 00:15:36,690
save a lot of money by running a search. So you should do it as soon as practical. If you want to

274
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:40,552
register, it takes money and sometimes you don't have the budget for this. But it will come

275
00:15:40,592 --> 00:15:40,812
later.

276
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,941
So what do you need to know about copyright?

277
00:15:44,422 --> 00:15:47,184
Well, copyright protects fixed expression

278
00:15:47,224 --> 00:15:51,167
of ideas, which is lawyer speak for your creative content.

279
00:15:51,447 --> 00:15:55,070
So that means things like the dialogue, the UX, the animation,

280
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,611
the art assets, the sound.

281
00:15:57,552 --> 00:16:03,176
the music, and even the code. It's a lot of, almost all of what goes into your game. But

282
00:16:03,316 --> 00:16:09,241
importantly, it does not protect abstract ideas. This is the exception I talked about. Your

283
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:14,845
game rules, your mechanics, the idea behind the game are not protected on their own, which is

284
00:16:14,885 --> 00:16:18,588
tough because it's often the inspiration for the game. This is why we can't have a million

285
00:16:18,608 --> 00:16:24,592
match three games and not have them infringe each other. Finally, I want to note that by

286
00:16:24,632 --> 00:16:26,474
default, at least under U.S. copyright law,

287
00:16:27,715 --> 00:16:32,317
by creating something that's copyright protectable, you own the copyright. Period. You

288
00:16:32,337 --> 00:16:35,379
don't have to register it. There's nothing you have to file. You own it because you made

289
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:39,981
it. That's the default rule. That's why it's important to have those work for hire

290
00:16:40,001 --> 00:16:44,864
agreements we talked about so that you override that default and it's owned by the

291
00:16:44,884 --> 00:16:51,067
company. What else to know about copyright? Copyright gives you the following rights. For

292
00:16:51,107 --> 00:16:56,330
your purposes, the important ones are the ability to reproduce and distribute and to make

293
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,091
derivative works.

294
00:16:58,207 --> 00:17:01,888
And not coincidentally, these are the things that are usually at issue in a publishing

295
00:17:01,928 --> 00:17:08,732
agreement. So let's move on to trademarks. Often confused with copyright, they are not the

296
00:17:08,752 --> 00:17:15,415
same thing. The purpose of trademarks is to protect brands and consumers' understanding of

297
00:17:15,495 --> 00:17:21,338
who made what. So they protect things like titles, company names, logos and tag lines.

298
00:17:22,482 --> 00:17:26,365
There are two sources of how you get trademark protection. The first in the U.S. is called

299
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:31,410
common law rights. And that comes from as soon as you start selling something using

300
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:35,954
a trademark, and the selling part is important, you start to accrue rights from that date

301
00:17:36,034 --> 00:17:41,079
forward. It's kind of like an XP bar that fills up over time gradually. It's based on

302
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:44,362
how widely you've sold it, how well it's known. It might be a little more difficult to

303
00:17:44,462 --> 00:17:48,964
prove, so there's another source of protection which is to go ahead and register federally.

304
00:17:49,464 --> 00:17:54,165
This takes an actual application process that could be rejected. It does come with certain

305
00:17:54,305 --> 00:18:00,768
fees. I tell people to expect around $1,500 total. But it gives you some benefits if you

306
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,648
ever end up in court. It means that your trademark

307
00:18:03,574 --> 00:18:08,176
unequivocally applies equally across the entire territory. And yes, there are similar processes

308
00:18:08,216 --> 00:18:13,498
for the EU and other territories. And most importantly, it lets you call dibs in advance

309
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:19,240
before you've sold your game. So that's the exception to the you have to use it. Not forever

310
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:21,742
in advance, but up to three years in advance if you need that much time.

311
00:18:23,355 --> 00:18:29,463
And as we said, in order to get your trademark rights, other than using it in advance, you

312
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,527
must use it in commerce, meaning selling it for money.

313
00:18:32,887 --> 00:18:33,869
So what does this mean?

314
00:18:34,349 --> 00:18:38,134
Announcing your game's name on your dev blog two years before it comes out does not give

315
00:18:38,194 --> 00:18:39,476
you any trademark rights.

316
00:18:41,463 --> 00:18:43,705
When you start selling the game, that's

317
00:18:43,745 --> 00:18:44,906
when you start to accrue the rights.

318
00:18:45,607 --> 00:18:47,989
And that's why it's so interesting and useful

319
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,292
that registration lets you get ahead of that a little bit.

320
00:18:50,992 --> 00:18:52,434
Finally, the strength of a trademark

321
00:18:52,474 --> 00:18:53,715
is based on how distinctive it is.

322
00:18:53,955 --> 00:18:56,518
Something that literally describes what you do,

323
00:18:56,818 --> 00:18:59,501
game company, jumpy platform, bad trademark.

324
00:18:59,841 --> 00:19:02,944
Something that is totally arbitrary is a good trademark.

325
00:19:04,717 --> 00:19:09,978
So intellectual property, pretty complicated topic. This is super oversimplified. But make

326
00:19:10,058 --> 00:19:17,660
sure to be aware of it. Know what you own via contracts and protect it. Our next topic is, I

327
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,842
think, a sore one for a lot of people. It's infringement. And why should you care about it?

328
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:25,662
Well, I think you all know why you should care about it.

329
00:19:27,335 --> 00:19:34,990
It takes away profit, it takes away revenue, it can tarnish your brand. It's just not a lot of

330
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:38,115
fun. So, when should you be thinking about it?

331
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:42,762
Well, as far as registering your different types of IP, for copyright, again, you should

332
00:19:42,822 --> 00:19:46,183
register at release just to get it out of the way because it's simple. Then you don't have to

333
00:19:46,203 --> 00:19:50,185
think about it. Or at the very latest before you might end up suing someone or at least

334
00:19:50,225 --> 00:19:55,047
threaten to sue them. Because having copyright registered multiplies the damages you can

335
00:19:55,107 --> 00:19:58,889
ask for. It basically just makes the hammer you're threatening them with really, really big.

336
00:20:00,148 --> 00:20:04,150
For trademark, you should do this as soon as practical. I think you should register it

337
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:08,893
before the game comes out, but practically you might not have the budget, so wait until

338
00:20:08,973 --> 00:20:13,715
your budget and your revenue justifies it. As far as responding to trademark infringement

339
00:20:13,995 --> 00:20:20,399
or copyright infringement, I would say do it as soon as you notice. Don't snooze on it. So

340
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:24,741
let's talk about copyright infringement and specifically about cloning.

341
00:20:27,357 --> 00:20:32,202
I regret to inform you that copyright infringement does not have a magic bullet solution.

342
00:20:32,743 --> 00:20:35,266
It's difficult to prove in the legal sense.

343
00:20:35,306 --> 00:20:38,890
There's this term substantial similarity, which makes it sound like it's common sense,

344
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,852
but it's not when it comes to the legal side of it.

345
00:20:41,253 --> 00:20:43,355
It may be obvious common sense, but

346
00:20:45,214 --> 00:20:49,938
a lawsuit is expensive and you may not win. But there are practical things you can do. So

347
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:55,524
someone is cloning your game or has stolen art assets or sound directly from you, first thing

348
00:20:55,544 --> 00:21:00,089
you can do is send a cease and desist letter. This goes to the infringer and it says, hey, we

349
00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:04,253
noticed you stole our stuff. You need to stop doing it by this time or else.

350
00:21:05,589 --> 00:21:11,991
You can also send a request to the content host. So you could send it to Apple or to

351
00:21:12,051 --> 00:21:16,712
Steam to ask them to take down the offending infringing content. This is done under the

352
00:21:16,752 --> 00:21:21,113
copyright context by what's called a DMCA takedown notice. It's a formalized process.

353
00:21:21,153 --> 00:21:25,094
There's a couple of requirements. Most things like Steam and Apple have a walk-through for

354
00:21:25,134 --> 00:21:29,935
it. Now, I am aware that these have a pretty bad reputation in some quarters. I like to

355
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:34,296
think of them basically as lightsabers. They could be used for good or for evil. And in

356
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,476
this case, you're using them for good.

357
00:21:36,676 --> 00:21:39,897
You should register the copyright if you haven't already when you notice the infringement.

358
00:21:40,777 --> 00:21:46,899
And then you could sue. Again, a lawsuit tens of thousands of dollars minimum. You may not

359
00:21:46,959 --> 00:21:53,360
win. So it does happen. People do sue in triple town. Usually it ends up in a settlement. It's

360
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:58,501
very expensive and cost prohibitive for most indies. So let's move on to trademark

361
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:02,802
infringement, which is when people have names for games that are confusingly similar to the

362
00:22:02,842 --> 00:22:03,102
public.

363
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,603
which can be a real issue, especially in mobile where

364
00:22:06,664 --> 00:22:09,328
everything is in the same list. And Flappy Bird, good example.

365
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:13,961
some of the solutions are kind of the same. You can send a cease and desist letter to the

366
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:20,203
infringer. I want to note that the tone of these doesn't have to be universally aggressive. I

367
00:22:20,223 --> 00:22:24,025
think a lot of people just send out cookie cutter, really scary letters, and those are

368
00:22:24,045 --> 00:22:29,167
justified sometimes. But I like to look at what the situation is, who the infringer is, and

369
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:34,069
I ask myself, what happens if this letter we send ends up on Reddit? Well, will it seem

370
00:22:34,109 --> 00:22:38,251
justified or will we seem like total dicks? So depending on who you're sending it to, you

371
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:40,332
might want to take a softer tone at first.

372
00:22:41,753 --> 00:22:46,538
You can also contact the distribution platforms again. While it's not DMCA, technically, Apple,

373
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:52,744
Steam, they all have standard policies for asking for stuff to be removed because of trademark

374
00:22:52,785 --> 00:22:59,191
infringement. This gets the stuff down. And finally, I want to note that unlike copyright,

375
00:22:59,331 --> 00:23:01,894
you do have to continue enforcing

376
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:08,743
your trademark to keep it strong. If you ignore 20 infringers and then you want to stop the

377
00:23:08,863 --> 00:23:12,626
21st because that's the one you care about, they do have a valid argument that your

378
00:23:12,646 --> 00:23:16,428
trademark doesn't have as much protection because you never enforced it. It doesn't mean you

379
00:23:16,448 --> 00:23:23,413
have to stomp on everyone, but, for instance, King.com, Banner Saga, it was a very ugly

380
00:23:23,453 --> 00:23:27,196
situation, but the part where King.com said, yeah, we kind of have to enforce our

381
00:23:27,216 --> 00:23:31,939
trademark, that wasn't bullshit. Some of the other parts, well, I leave you to your

382
00:23:31,979 --> 00:23:32,240
judgment.

383
00:23:33,224 --> 00:23:37,287
So the takeaways are that there are no magic bullets, but there are practical things you can

384
00:23:37,327 --> 00:23:42,931
do, and you should do them early. Our final topic is privacy, which I think is a blind spot

385
00:23:42,971 --> 00:23:48,114
for some indies. A lot of people may think it doesn't apply to them. So why should you care

386
00:23:48,134 --> 00:23:53,678
about privacy? Well, most if not all games these days collect some amount of user data,

387
00:23:54,198 --> 00:23:57,260
whether it's through, you know, directly collecting it, like ‑‑

388
00:23:58,716 --> 00:24:01,858
geolocation or through third party stuff. So even if you're

389
00:24:01,878 --> 00:24:04,060
single player puzzle game, you've got leader boards,

390
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,441
that's taking data from your users and putting it elsewhere.

391
00:24:07,082 --> 00:24:11,325
Twitter integration, same thing. Any payment processing, ad

392
00:24:11,685 --> 00:24:13,446
networks, all of these are privacy issues.

393
00:24:14,315 --> 00:24:19,263
Governments, specifically the U.S. government, state and local, and the EU have been getting a lot

394
00:24:19,283 --> 00:24:23,770
more aggressive about enforcing privacy issues. And they don't just target big people. People can

395
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:29,298
and do get fined, and they have to pay money. There's obviously a reputational issue at stake.

396
00:24:29,398 --> 00:24:29,819
Think about...

397
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,963
how the public is responding to the Apple iPhone issue.

398
00:24:32,983 --> 00:24:34,646
People are thinking about privacy, it matters.

399
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:36,829
And finally, data breaches.

400
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:39,312
They can and they do happen.

401
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,976
Sony is still paying a lot,

402
00:24:42,296 --> 00:24:45,321
and a lot of reputational damage for the hacks a while back.

403
00:24:47,063 --> 00:24:49,025
So, when should you be thinking about privacy?

404
00:24:49,645 --> 00:24:51,707
I think you should be thinking about it at three times.

405
00:24:52,268 --> 00:24:54,810
One, during development, because this is the time

406
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:56,471
at which you can decide, you know, do we really need

407
00:24:56,511 --> 00:24:58,934
to track, like, the geolocation of our users,

408
00:24:58,994 --> 00:24:59,814
or would that just be cool?

409
00:25:00,515 --> 00:25:02,397
It's cheaper to take that out before the game's done.

410
00:25:03,037 --> 00:25:06,801
You should think about it at launch, because you need to have a privacy policy in place.

411
00:25:07,141 --> 00:25:09,924
And you should continue to think about it post‑launch, because things can change.

412
00:25:10,285 --> 00:25:12,687
An update might add a new feature with a new privacy issue.

413
00:25:12,767 --> 00:25:14,629
You may start using an ad network.

414
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:19,394
Or the terms of the people you work with might change, and you need to be aware of that.

415
00:25:20,395 --> 00:25:22,277
So what are the best practices for privacy?

416
00:25:24,337 --> 00:25:29,261
The main rule for me, if you don't need it, don't collect it. I like to call this the Jurassic Park

417
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:34,525
principle. Just because you can breed velociraptors does not mean that you should breed

418
00:25:34,565 --> 00:25:37,608
velociraptors. I know they're totally awesome, but they

419
00:25:38,145 --> 00:25:45,389
doors. So you should know and disclose the third parties that you share your data with, because

420
00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:49,270
you'll be sharing your users' data with them. That means ad networks, that means leader

421
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:55,813
boards, that means, you know, anything that is a third party taking data. You need to know

422
00:25:55,853 --> 00:26:00,356
what they do with it and you need to disclose it in a prominent and accessible privacy

423
00:26:00,396 --> 00:26:02,136
policy. This means

424
00:26:03,155 --> 00:26:07,758
accessible from the bottom of your website everywhere and on the splash screen of your

425
00:26:07,778 --> 00:26:14,062
game or at the very least in the main menu. And please, please, if you remember one thing

426
00:26:14,082 --> 00:26:19,265
about privacy, do not do this. I know it's tempting. Do not copy paste someone else's

427
00:26:19,285 --> 00:26:23,207
privacy policy, change the company name and say, cool, we're done. Because now,

428
00:26:23,288 --> 00:26:27,870
congratulations, you are probably actively lying to your users because you have no idea what's

429
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:31,773
in there and you probably don't do what it says. That's a great way to get fined.

430
00:26:32,647 --> 00:26:38,071
So what goes into one of these privacy policies? The following things. It should be simple.

431
00:26:38,151 --> 00:26:44,757
It should be four-ish pages. It should be readable by a real human, not a lawyer. And it

432
00:26:44,777 --> 00:26:50,402
tells them what you're collecting, how you use it, who you share it with, and how they can get

433
00:26:50,502 --> 00:26:54,385
access to it and change it if there's a problem, and what you're doing to protect it. And you

434
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:58,429
want to be honest. This is not the place to hide things. You need to disclose everything,

435
00:26:58,509 --> 00:27:01,131
even if you might not do it. If you may do it, say you may do it.

436
00:27:02,815 --> 00:27:09,338
Finally, if your game is marketed to people under 13, there is a host of additional things

437
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:13,880
that apply because of a law called COPPA, Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.

438
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,161
We don't have time to get into it.

439
00:27:15,241 --> 00:27:16,582
It is a huge morass.

440
00:27:17,182 --> 00:27:20,824
My advice would be to talk to a privacy professional.

441
00:27:21,712 --> 00:27:27,575
avoid collecting personally identifiable information like names, pictures, and potentially

442
00:27:27,615 --> 00:27:31,518
to talk to a company that's called a COPPA safe harbor. These are companies that are

443
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:38,863
certified to be able to help you become compliant. You pay them, they help you. So privacy,

444
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:41,625
please take it seriously. Have a privacy policy. Keep it up to date.

445
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:49,071
So we've made it through quite a large amount of potentially dry stuff. I'm happy that you

446
00:27:49,111 --> 00:27:54,573
came along with me. And with that, we've reached the end. Congratulations. Thank you very much

447
00:27:54,613 --> 00:28:04,217
for attending. And I would be happy to take some questions now and then afterwards in the

448
00:28:04,657 --> 00:28:10,379
spillover room and probably at the bar if you find me later, too. So great. Happy to take

449
00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:10,739
questions.

450
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:17,147
think there is a mic in the middle too. You can go there.

451
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:24,671
I'm just going to say it's an awesome presentation. Thank you

452
00:28:24,711 --> 00:28:29,813
very much. I enjoyed it. Thank you very much. Hey, I'm a solo

453
00:28:29,913 --> 00:28:35,276
Indy and I was given some advice a while ago about starting a

454
00:28:35,476 --> 00:28:39,518
single person LLC and specifically I was told that

455
00:28:40,358 --> 00:28:41,039
there's not.

456
00:28:42,064 --> 00:28:47,368
from the, if you're being sued and you are a sole proprietor or a single person LLC,

457
00:28:47,708 --> 00:28:52,692
you are not any more protected than if you hadn't formed that corporation or whatever

458
00:28:52,712 --> 00:28:54,553
at all. Is that true or is that bullshit?

459
00:28:54,753 --> 00:28:59,236
I mean, again, the answer to a lot of these will be it depends, because, which is why

460
00:28:59,276 --> 00:29:02,539
this is education, not advice. It does depend on the situation.

461
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:09,862
will have some level of liability protection, but it depends on how you run things. The reason

462
00:29:09,902 --> 00:29:16,425
that you want to have a ‑‑ have this sort of ‑‑ the documents in place as far as the

463
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:21,366
operating agreement, even if you're a solo, is that if you make an LLC but then you just kind

464
00:29:21,406 --> 00:29:25,288
of act like a person and you don't do anything, no formalities, you don't keep any records,

465
00:29:26,968 --> 00:29:29,650
from a legal perspective, it allows them to argue in a dispute,

466
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:31,351
hey, this isn't really a company.

467
00:29:31,371 --> 00:29:32,751
They're just pretending they're a company, right?

468
00:29:32,932 --> 00:29:34,492
It's the same thing as if you have a corporation

469
00:29:34,512 --> 00:29:36,393
and you never have meetings and you never take minutes

470
00:29:36,433 --> 00:29:37,054
and that kind of stuff.

471
00:29:37,334 --> 00:29:38,374
Those formalities matter.

472
00:29:39,995 --> 00:29:42,857
One of the reasons, definitely as a sole proprietor,

473
00:29:42,917 --> 00:29:44,337
yeah, you don't have any.

474
00:29:44,978 --> 00:29:46,538
That's not an actual corporate.

475
00:29:46,899 --> 00:29:52,106
entity. But as an LLC, one of the other reasons you want to do it beyond just the liability

476
00:29:52,147 --> 00:29:56,733
protection is even if it's just you, you may work with other people. And if you work with them

477
00:29:56,753 --> 00:30:00,198
and you don't really have contracts but someone's been working with you for a while, you've got

478
00:30:00,238 --> 00:30:00,639
an LLC.

479
00:30:01,761 --> 00:30:04,985
later on they say, hey, I thought, I remember a conversation where you were going to give me

480
00:30:05,065 --> 00:30:09,751
equity. He's like, no, no, no, you're a contractor. That was our agreement. He goes, well,

481
00:30:10,011 --> 00:30:13,636
I think I contributed X amount to the company. If you don't have the document that says, here

482
00:30:13,656 --> 00:30:17,421
are the rules, I'm the sole owner, I'm the manager, I have 100% of the equity, that can be

483
00:30:17,761 --> 00:30:19,564
more of a nasty fight. So, yeah.

484
00:30:23,044 --> 00:30:24,925
Hi, thanks, that was a really great talk.

485
00:30:25,966 --> 00:30:27,107
This might be a very short question.

486
00:30:27,167 --> 00:30:30,189
Have you ever heard of an online tool called DoContract?

487
00:30:30,209 --> 00:30:30,269
Yes.

488
00:30:30,469 --> 00:30:32,050
That some indie game developers put together?

489
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:37,053
Yes, I think I talked to the person putting that together when they were doing it.

490
00:30:39,355 --> 00:30:39,895
Is there a question?

491
00:30:39,915 --> 00:30:44,518
No, the question was if you're familiar with it, because I used it with the composer on my game.

492
00:30:44,598 --> 00:30:45,219
I'm just curious.

493
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:48,740
how good you feel it is as a contract and if you think it's worth using.

494
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,902
So I haven't looked in detail at it, so I can't render an opinion on it without looking

495
00:30:53,962 --> 00:30:54,123
at it.

496
00:30:54,563 --> 00:30:59,745
I would say that I definitely understand the budget constraints of an Indy and the desire

497
00:31:00,105 --> 00:31:01,125
to use tools like that.

498
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:06,272
Usually you're better off with a contract, but here's the big

499
00:31:06,372 --> 00:31:11,775
caveat. Don't use a tool that you don't understand. So, you

500
00:31:11,795 --> 00:31:14,457
know, if you ‑‑ having a contract is important, but also

501
00:31:14,557 --> 00:31:17,539
knowing what it does, because if you say, yeah, yeah, just give

502
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:18,399
me the contract that does X.

503
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,801
And there may be single sentences in there

504
00:31:22,821 --> 00:31:24,862
that do the opposite of what you think they do.

505
00:31:25,762 --> 00:31:28,343
And so from my perspective in my practice,

506
00:31:28,423 --> 00:31:31,163
I try not to just fire off a form contract

507
00:31:31,184 --> 00:31:31,924
and be like, here, use this.

508
00:31:32,784 --> 00:31:34,845
I like to walk a client through it and say, look,

509
00:31:35,045 --> 00:31:35,965
here's what it's doing.

510
00:31:36,245 --> 00:31:37,385
Is this what you agreed to?

511
00:31:37,585 --> 00:31:39,846
Does this actually conform to your agreement?

512
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,206
I want them to be comfortable.

513
00:31:41,326 --> 00:31:43,247
And it goes back to that whole, if you've negotiated,

514
00:31:43,267 --> 00:31:44,947
thought about it, you're not going to be surprised.

515
00:31:44,967 --> 00:31:45,187
So.

516
00:31:46,548 --> 00:31:50,890
You know, I believe the person who put it together had mentioned they talked to a lot of

517
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:55,772
attorneys. But I can't give you an official opinion on it. I just would say make sure you

518
00:31:55,792 --> 00:31:58,934
understand what you use if you get it from a non-lawyer source.

519
00:31:59,154 --> 00:31:59,534
Cool. Thank you.

520
00:32:02,732 --> 00:32:08,634
great talk, thanks. Just as regards COPPA, without getting into it, I know you said it's big,

521
00:32:08,774 --> 00:32:14,515
could you possibly clarify on the definition of marketing towards under 13s? Would a universal

522
00:32:14,575 --> 00:32:19,677
audience include that or not? Sure, so the question was about COPPA and children under 13

523
00:32:19,757 --> 00:32:26,039
and the privacy laws there. It's a U.S. law. The very broad strokes are that it applies to

524
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:30,480
not just, basically any Internet operator, someone who does stuff on the Internet or

525
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,101
collects data.

526
00:32:32,687 --> 00:32:40,790
and you are included under it if your product or game is targeted at or arguably appeals to in a

527
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:47,133
major way people under 13. So, yeah, any game that's fairly simple might fall under COPPA.

528
00:32:48,797 --> 00:32:53,082
the, it's concerned with the collection of personally identifiable information. So if

529
00:32:53,102 --> 00:32:58,870
there's just like, if you're randomly collecting, you know, a randomized unique ID for the phone

530
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:02,094
or whatever, that's not as much of an issue as if you're taking a name or a birthday.

531
00:33:04,057 --> 00:33:08,981
So that's kind of how it's defined who's under it. And you're allowed to collect that stuff,

532
00:33:09,282 --> 00:33:13,366
but you're required to get what's called verifiable parental consent, which is this nightmare

533
00:33:13,386 --> 00:33:16,829
that's really, really difficult because the law was designed for websites in like 99, not

534
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:22,835
for mobile apps. So, again, one easy way is to get a copy of the law and then you can

535
00:33:22,995 --> 00:33:27,678
you may just decide to age gate. You put up a thing, what's your birthday, and neutral age

536
00:33:27,718 --> 00:33:31,020
gate. You don't say are you under 13, you say what's your birthday, and you shunt anyone who

537
00:33:31,781 --> 00:33:37,384
falls under 13 somewhere else. Or you put them into a version of the app that doesn't have ads

538
00:33:37,604 --> 00:33:42,047
or anything that's going to be collecting data. That's about as deep as I can go. Trust me, it's

539
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:47,191
a very deep well, so I would talk to a privacy person or one of the safe harbor companies.

540
00:33:48,451 --> 00:33:48,752
No problem.

541
00:33:50,852 --> 00:33:57,016
I had a question about parody. If you say you're making a comedic game, South Park games,

542
00:33:57,056 --> 00:34:02,840
for example, how does that apply? Why do you say this is a parody work and what's a violation?

543
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,563
So the question was about parody, making fun of things, which is a copyright question.

544
00:34:09,344 --> 00:34:14,105
Fair use is a very popular topic on the Internet. I deliberately didn't address it because I

545
00:34:14,165 --> 00:34:18,426
wanted to stick to stuff I felt was most common in my practice. And the number of times it

546
00:34:18,486 --> 00:34:25,028
comes up realistically is quite limited. But in general, copyright infringement happens

547
00:34:25,068 --> 00:34:27,749
when you use something that's protected without permission.

548
00:34:29,269 --> 00:34:34,232
Fair use, of which parody is an example, not a technical

549
00:34:34,352 --> 00:34:35,513
category, but an example.

550
00:34:36,273 --> 00:34:38,074
Fair use is an exception to that.

551
00:34:38,475 --> 00:34:41,396
So I know this gets technical, but someone

552
00:34:41,416 --> 00:34:44,558
has described once fair use as the right to be sued by Disney.

553
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:47,480
And what they mean by that, I mean, yeah, it's funny.

554
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,461
But it's also accurate.

555
00:34:48,481 --> 00:34:50,142
Because what they mean by that is fair use,

556
00:34:51,162 --> 00:34:53,404
if your defense is, hey, we made this game with Mickey Mouse.

557
00:34:53,484 --> 00:34:54,524
Oh, no, we were making fun of him.

558
00:34:54,584 --> 00:34:55,465
He's drinking booze.

559
00:34:55,505 --> 00:34:56,105
It's clearly not.

560
00:34:57,406 --> 00:35:05,033
which was actually a case from the 70s. Basically, the only time you get to make that argument is in

561
00:35:05,114 --> 00:35:09,238
court. It's an affirmative defense. That means you can't just be like, no, you can't take us to

562
00:35:09,278 --> 00:35:14,483
court because fair use. No, no, we're suing you if you want to make your case to the judge why this

563
00:35:14,523 --> 00:35:18,506
is fair use, you're going to do it in court. And by that point, you've already spent a ton of

564
00:35:18,566 --> 00:35:19,868
money just to have that conversation.

565
00:35:21,654 --> 00:35:26,777
What I would say is in general, if it's close to the line, you're taking on more risk. It's a

566
00:35:26,857 --> 00:35:33,001
question of risk, right? So it's not ‑‑ there are no bright lines here. Under U.S. copyright

567
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:37,624
law, fair use is determined on these factors, which means, cool, a lot of things could be

568
00:35:37,644 --> 00:35:41,106
fair use, but it also means to figure out if it really is, you have to go to court. That's a

569
00:35:41,146 --> 00:35:45,029
game for people with a lot of money, unfortunately. No problem.

570
00:35:48,198 --> 00:35:49,338
Hi, thanks for doing this talk.

571
00:35:49,578 --> 00:35:50,599
Oh, no problem.

572
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:53,199
How much screen shake can I legally get away with?

573
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,961
The question was how much screen shake can you legally

574
00:35:57,981 --> 00:35:58,561
get away with?

575
00:35:59,581 --> 00:36:02,302
You know, as much as you like.

576
00:36:03,902 --> 00:36:06,503
But I think the way this ties into the talk is,

577
00:36:07,063 --> 00:36:09,524
I mentioned that there were a lot of other kinds of contracts

578
00:36:09,544 --> 00:36:09,884
that come up.

579
00:36:10,984 --> 00:36:13,525
One of them is the EULA, the End User License Agreement.

580
00:36:14,245 --> 00:36:16,726
That is one that everyone makes fun of, doesn't read.

581
00:36:16,806 --> 00:36:17,366
Like, you know.

582
00:36:17,786 --> 00:36:18,267
It's boring.

583
00:36:18,627 --> 00:36:19,588
It is important.

584
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:24,374
And that is the section where, if your game contains stuff

585
00:36:24,394 --> 00:36:27,638
that might be like an epilepsy risk or may

586
00:36:27,658 --> 00:36:29,300
have some medical thing, that's where

587
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:32,624
you make the giant all caps disclaimer that says, look,

588
00:36:32,644 --> 00:36:34,787
if this blows up your computer and melts half your face.

589
00:36:35,287 --> 00:36:41,989
Sorry. As is. Buyer beware. So that is important. And, you know, anything that might come up

590
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:45,370
through the use of your stuff is handled in the end user license agreement. And those

591
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:49,831
also are not cookie cutter. Because they should apply to what kind of game you have. Just

592
00:36:49,891 --> 00:36:54,172
as a note, since I mentioned them, EULAs are a great place to handle if you've got user

593
00:36:54,192 --> 00:36:58,713
generated content. That's where you talk about, hey, do you own the stuff you make in my game?

594
00:36:58,753 --> 00:37:03,094
Do I own it? If you upload like photos or something or anything to my game, do we get

595
00:37:03,134 --> 00:37:04,194
a license to use it?

596
00:37:05,294 --> 00:37:06,776
you want to take care of all that in there.

597
00:37:06,816 --> 00:37:07,656
So that's, yeah.

598
00:37:08,317 --> 00:37:08,657
Good question.

599
00:37:08,677 --> 00:37:08,918
Thank you.

600
00:37:09,138 --> 00:37:09,618
Yeah, no problem.

601
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,362
Oh, last question.

602
00:37:13,402 --> 00:37:14,423
On the last question, everybody.

603
00:37:15,323 --> 00:37:15,704
Just kidding.

604
00:37:16,024 --> 00:37:20,508
Hey, as a composer, with smaller projects or smaller teams,

605
00:37:20,588 --> 00:37:23,771
we usually keep the copyrights and the IP,

606
00:37:24,452 --> 00:37:26,974
but I know with larger AAA companies and games

607
00:37:27,094 --> 00:37:28,736
that becomes a work for hire normally.

608
00:37:29,276 --> 00:37:34,499
And I was wondering, at what point do you see that changeover when it comes to budget

609
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:35,960
or company size or what?

610
00:37:36,901 --> 00:37:43,805
So the question was about composers and how sometimes the IP to the compositions is licensed

611
00:37:43,865 --> 00:37:44,846
rather than assigned.

612
00:37:44,866 --> 00:37:46,227
Does it work for hire like we discussed?

613
00:37:47,908 --> 00:37:53,789
So it's interesting. Musicians tend to be actually the place where I see the most people

614
00:37:53,849 --> 00:37:58,410
requesting that it be a license rather than work for hire. I think that has to do with

615
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:02,671
just the history of the music industry and musicians being a little more aware of IP

616
00:38:02,711 --> 00:38:08,933
issues than other creative industries traditionally. I would say that it's not necessarily a function

617
00:38:09,013 --> 00:38:14,554
of size. It's based on the situation, right? So from ‑‑ neither side is trying to

618
00:38:14,594 --> 00:38:16,814
screw the other. What's going on is the ‑‑

619
00:38:18,515 --> 00:38:23,157
developer wants to have it as work for hire because that's so much simpler. If they ever need

620
00:38:23,177 --> 00:38:27,958
to remix the sound, if they're going to put it in a trailer somewhere, if they use a snippet of

621
00:38:27,998 --> 00:38:30,859
it in the sequel, but not the whole thing. They just want to know that they don't have to hunt

622
00:38:30,919 --> 00:38:34,601
down the person and make sure that it was within the license. Because when you license it,

623
00:38:34,861 --> 00:38:38,262
you've got to be like, what are the exact parameters where you can use it, right?

624
00:38:38,342 --> 00:38:38,802
Yeah.

625
00:38:39,522 --> 00:38:44,244
So I think that's really something to be negotiated. A lot of times I've seen musicians say,

626
00:38:44,284 --> 00:38:50,767
look, it's this much per minute of song if it's a license and I get to sell. And then in that

627
00:38:50,807 --> 00:38:53,688
case you want to determine who can sell the soundtrack. If they sell the soundtrack, can they

628
00:38:53,728 --> 00:38:59,210
use the name of the game and all that kind of stuff. Or if you want it lock, stock and barrel,

629
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:04,132
then that's fine, but it's going to be more expensive. So it's not like one or the other.

630
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:08,074
It's more what the parties need and what they can afford, I would say.

631
00:39:08,154 --> 00:39:13,197
Yeah, it seems like the one area where it's not necessarily always switched over to the

632
00:39:13,257 --> 00:39:19,440
company to own. And I don't know. I think at the lower level you probably don't earn so much
