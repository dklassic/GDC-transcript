00:00:06,585 --> 00:00:14,611
Thank you, Ryan. Thank you for coming to this talk. I like to go kind of quick because I like to

2
00:00:14,651 --> 00:00:19,715
pack in as much information as possible so this talk will be uploaded to the vault and I've also

3
00:00:19,735 --> 00:00:23,978
uploaded the slides in PDF form so just feel free to let it kind of wash over you.

4
00:00:25,038 --> 00:00:27,861
Also make sure to fill out the survey

5
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:31,243
that I think is emailed to you within 15 minutes,

6
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,865
especially if you enjoyed it.

7
00:00:33,805 --> 00:00:34,846
Check your spam folders.

8
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:36,588
If you didn't enjoy it, it's just spam.

9
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,328
Don't worry about it.

10
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:39,090
Let's get started.

11
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:42,012
So this is 1,000 Tiny Tales, Emergent Storytelling,

12
00:00:42,052 --> 00:00:42,833
and Slime Rancher.

13
00:00:43,973 --> 00:00:47,016
And who I am is the co-founder and CEO of Monami Park.

14
00:00:47,196 --> 00:00:48,577
I designed Slime Rancher.

15
00:00:48,677 --> 00:00:50,859
I also designed Spiral Knights

16
00:00:50,959 --> 00:00:52,800
back when I was at Three Rings and Sega.

17
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:57,865
And there's me on Twitter, but don't follow me yet. Let me earn it

18
00:00:59,367 --> 00:01:04,632
Let me also tell you why I'm giving this talk. I think emergent storytelling is super valuable for indies

19
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:06,754
It is something that

20
00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:08,776
effectively generates content

21
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:11,920
And I don't think enough games are doing it.

22
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,881
So as an indie, you can stand out

23
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,922
by implementing this in your game.

24
00:01:16,362 --> 00:01:18,503
And it's also what makes games surprising.

25
00:01:18,523 --> 00:01:21,524
And I think that's one of the most important things

26
00:01:21,604 --> 00:01:24,305
a video game can be, is surprising.

27
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:28,632
Is everyone familiar with Slime Rancher?

28
00:01:29,032 --> 00:01:30,773
Show of hands maybe who's played it.

29
00:01:30,853 --> 00:01:31,753
Oh wow, awesome.

30
00:01:32,074 --> 00:01:32,834
Thank you so much.

31
00:01:33,895 --> 00:01:35,035
I still need to introduce it

32
00:01:35,075 --> 00:01:36,396
because some people aren't familiar with it.

33
00:01:36,476 --> 00:01:39,938
So it's a first person farming, ranching game with slimes.

34
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,759
The name of the game is.

35
00:01:42,419 --> 00:01:42,780
very

36
00:01:44,241 --> 00:01:44,441
apt

37
00:01:45,082 --> 00:01:50,988
There's a very heavy physics simulation. It's super chaotic and the world emphasizes exploration. It has a

38
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:54,952
Sort of a original Zelda like quality to it where you kind of just go off

39
00:01:55,393 --> 00:02:00,918
wherever you want and you are slowly unlocking portions of the world and so let's see a trailer of

40
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:02,200
slime rancher

41
00:02:16,956 --> 00:02:20,058
That's Slime Ranger.

42
00:02:46,928 --> 00:02:49,251
And now next is my favorite slide here.

43
00:02:50,092 --> 00:02:51,333
It was a big hit for us.

44
00:02:51,813 --> 00:02:55,717
This was Monami Park's first game, and it did very well.

45
00:02:55,777 --> 00:02:57,339
And the reason I'm showing you this is,

46
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,882
one, I think it sort of validates my talk a little bit,

47
00:03:00,242 --> 00:03:02,604
but two, because I think a...

48
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:07,307
not insignificant portion of our success is because

49
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:10,148
Slime Rancher has emergent storytelling qualities to it.

50
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:12,969
If you watch YouTube videos of it in action,

51
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:14,290
that becomes very apparent.

52
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,011
I think that's sort of why people enjoy this.

53
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:20,993
So about emergent storytelling, full disclosure,

54
00:03:21,013 --> 00:03:23,534
I am not an expert on emergent storytelling,

55
00:03:23,594 --> 00:03:26,175
nor does Slime Rancher execute on it particularly well.

56
00:03:26,515 --> 00:03:28,676
And that is the entire point of my talk.

57
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,578
We did not set out to make a game

58
00:03:31,638 --> 00:03:33,298
that is all about this subject.

59
00:03:34,499 --> 00:03:37,422
but it does it a little bit, and it does it pretty well,

60
00:03:38,023 --> 00:03:42,948
and we think that that really contributed to its success.

61
00:03:43,028 --> 00:03:45,670
So that's why I want to talk about my experience with it

62
00:03:46,111 --> 00:03:47,612
and my opinions on this sort of thing,

63
00:03:48,293 --> 00:03:49,934
because I don't think you need to be an expert

64
00:03:50,015 --> 00:03:52,177
in this subject in order to implement it well

65
00:03:52,217 --> 00:03:53,178
into your game.

66
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:55,620
But first we need to know what the heck

67
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,001
emergent storytelling is.

68
00:03:59,112 --> 00:04:01,735
My definition is when game systems tell a story,

69
00:04:01,895 --> 00:04:03,717
often through gameplay that wasn't scripted.

70
00:04:04,457 --> 00:04:06,579
It's often called emergence, behaviors,

71
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:07,900
gameplay, storytelling.

72
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:10,022
To me, it's all the same thing.

73
00:04:10,543 --> 00:04:11,584
It's all stories.

74
00:04:11,764 --> 00:04:14,427
At least that's how players are going to perceive them.

75
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:18,110
In reality, it's you cook emergent behaviors

76
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,571
into the actors in your game,

77
00:04:19,772 --> 00:04:21,253
which generates emergent gameplay,

78
00:04:21,313 --> 00:04:23,455
which is then viewed as emergent storytelling.

79
00:04:24,616 --> 00:04:27,921
but the terms are used fairly interchangeably,

80
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,604
so keep that in mind.

81
00:04:30,765 --> 00:04:32,668
Regarding these stories too, they can be really short.

82
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:35,492
We're not talking about Dwarf Fortress levels

83
00:04:35,613 --> 00:04:38,557
of long form narrative that are generated here.

84
00:04:38,997 --> 00:04:40,538
it can be a tiny little moment,

85
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:43,618
and oftentimes those moments are the most memorable thing.

86
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:47,920
They're basically just a sequence of and-thens.

87
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,321
The most common form of emergent storytelling in a game

88
00:04:51,621 --> 00:04:53,781
is just sort of a chain reaction of events

89
00:04:53,901 --> 00:04:55,782
that ultimately terminates and the player goes,

90
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:56,902
whoa, that was crazy.

91
00:04:57,982 --> 00:05:02,706
So let's look at some games that incorporate this.

92
00:05:03,226 --> 00:05:05,228
These are obviously sort of the heavy hitters here,

93
00:05:05,328 --> 00:05:06,969
the creation or base building games.

94
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:11,112
These games tend to be all about emergent storytelling.

95
00:05:12,428 --> 00:05:15,111
because the player is able to modify the game space.

96
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:18,837
And when they do that, they're disrupting the space

97
00:05:18,997 --> 00:05:22,201
in such a way that emergent behaviors can thrive.

98
00:05:22,862 --> 00:05:25,125
So these are sort of some very classic examples.

99
00:05:26,147 --> 00:05:28,210
Next we have multiplayer focused games.

100
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:33,372
And the reason why these generate emergent stories is because you have other people in them.

101
00:05:33,512 --> 00:05:38,574
And anytime you have other people in a shared space, that's going to create emergent stories.

102
00:05:39,414 --> 00:05:45,716
Eve, for example, all the best moments ever in Eve that make the news are all these sort of emergent.

103
00:05:46,758 --> 00:05:50,684
gameplay situations that play out in this sort of space opera fashion.

104
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:53,908
Battlefield, for example, anytime you've...

105
00:05:54,249 --> 00:05:58,075
you know, the designers probably didn't anticipate people sitting on wings of planes

106
00:05:58,295 --> 00:06:01,700
and shooting other people. It just happened, and they embraced it.

107
00:06:02,861 --> 00:06:06,962
And then you have this sort of what I like to think of as like the triple-a version of

108
00:06:07,563 --> 00:06:14,545
emergent storytelling games these big sandboxes where actors are bumping into the protagonist and

109
00:06:15,005 --> 00:06:18,486
The protagonist is causing these chain reactions to occur

110
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:26,769
You know leopards eating soldiers you were about to shoot in Far Cry for example is sort of an example of an emergent behavior

111
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,872
And Slime Rancher fits into this, but only a little bit.

112
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:32,433
And again, that's the point.

113
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:35,756
But how emergent storytelling fits into a game

114
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:38,298
is the capacity for emergent storytelling in a game

115
00:06:38,338 --> 00:06:40,119
is often linked to how much control

116
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,961
the designer is willing to give up.

117
00:06:43,182 --> 00:06:45,343
And like I said, a little goes a long way.

118
00:06:45,784 --> 00:06:48,226
So incorporating emergent behavior at all

119
00:06:48,386 --> 00:06:50,127
means kind of letting go a little bit.

120
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,874
And here is a great example of two blockbuster games

121
00:06:55,914 --> 00:06:59,518
that are very similar, genre definers for their time.

122
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,801
One incorporates, in my opinion,

123
00:07:02,921 --> 00:07:05,263
emergent behaviors more than the other,

124
00:07:05,283 --> 00:07:07,446
and is way more memorable.

125
00:07:07,826 --> 00:07:09,708
So Call of Duty, great game.

126
00:07:09,868 --> 00:07:11,309
The original Modern Warfare, loved it.

127
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:18,076
But when you're taking cover and because a jeep just exploded and you got a sniper on you and that every time you play that

128
00:07:18,116 --> 00:07:22,081
It's gonna play out pretty much the same. Halo has lots of moments like that

129
00:07:22,561 --> 00:07:23,542
There's also a moment

130
00:07:24,063 --> 00:07:29,008
multiple times in the game where they say get an award hog and get to point B and you could do that and then it

131
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:32,051
Plays like Call of Duty or you can jump it off a ramp

132
00:07:32,531 --> 00:07:34,853
with grenades fused to the back of it

133
00:07:34,893 --> 00:07:37,655
to get some extra push and land on the next encounter,

134
00:07:38,035 --> 00:07:41,058
just ending it before the designer ever sort of intended.

135
00:07:41,998 --> 00:07:44,660
And that is a great example of people

136
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,961
kind of creating their own fun

137
00:07:46,421 --> 00:07:49,784
using the toys that the developer left for them.

138
00:07:50,084 --> 00:07:53,006
And for that reason, Halo for me is way more memorable.

139
00:07:55,028 --> 00:07:57,750
So now, how is emergent storytelling used in Slime Rancher,

140
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:58,951
kind of the focus of this talk.

141
00:08:00,143 --> 00:08:05,387
But before we begin, the golden rule is emergent storytelling is a collision of wants and needs.

142
00:08:05,608 --> 00:08:09,050
Wants should always inform needs, positively or negatively.

143
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:14,895
That is how I think of emergent storytelling in Slime Rancher and all other games.

144
00:08:15,676 --> 00:08:18,398
Your actors have wants and they have needs.

145
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:22,341
And when those collide, really interesting things happen,

146
00:08:22,381 --> 00:08:24,042
really memorable things happen.

147
00:08:24,942 --> 00:08:27,264
So let's cover slime needs.

148
00:08:28,184 --> 00:08:30,105
There's only three, and one of them

149
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,186
you're probably not familiar with.

150
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:35,708
Slimes need to eat, they need to not die,

151
00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:38,930
and they sometimes need to go somewhere for no reason,

152
00:08:39,931 --> 00:08:41,772
which is a hidden need.

153
00:08:42,573 --> 00:08:44,495
and we threw that in there just to add variance.

154
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,237
So sometimes a slime without you knowing it

155
00:08:47,598 --> 00:08:50,481
decides over there is my life now

156
00:08:51,001 --> 00:08:53,844
and will do whatever they need to do to get over there

157
00:08:54,184 --> 00:08:56,547
similar to getting over there to eat,

158
00:08:56,747 --> 00:08:59,149
which has equal drive for them.

159
00:09:01,161 --> 00:09:04,263
So about needs, the more needs you introduce,

160
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:05,944
the harder your system becomes for you

161
00:09:06,244 --> 00:09:07,324
and the player to manage.

162
00:09:07,384 --> 00:09:08,905
This is super, super important.

163
00:09:09,986 --> 00:09:11,587
Slime Rancher sort of succeeds

164
00:09:11,687 --> 00:09:13,728
because you need to make sure slimes don't die,

165
00:09:14,028 --> 00:09:15,449
you need to make sure they eat.

166
00:09:15,849 --> 00:09:16,509
That's pretty much it.

167
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,951
Every other weird thing that the game throws at you

168
00:09:20,391 --> 00:09:23,893
is then sort of dealt with

169
00:09:24,494 --> 00:09:27,375
while dealing with these two sort of principal needs

170
00:09:27,455 --> 00:09:28,416
that the slimes have.

171
00:09:28,836 --> 00:09:31,477
So if you're making a game, or if, for example,

172
00:09:31,517 --> 00:09:36,058
we made Slime Rancher where they also had temperature needs,

173
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:38,878
or some were scared of the dark, et cetera, et cetera,

174
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:42,319
you're just turning it into a big list of things to manage

175
00:09:42,439 --> 00:09:44,759
that all sort of act independently from one another,

176
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:46,940
because that's what needs are.

177
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,140
Needs are binary.

178
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,021
They either are fed or they're not fed.

179
00:09:50,441 --> 00:09:52,061
Wants are way more interesting.

180
00:09:53,241 --> 00:09:56,222
Wants are, in Slime Rancher, there's a giant list of them.

181
00:09:59,421 --> 00:10:01,882
You can see none of them are essential for their survival.

182
00:10:02,642 --> 00:10:05,162
There's even more than this, but there's not a lot more.

183
00:10:06,163 --> 00:10:08,383
Because this intersection of wants and needs

184
00:10:08,503 --> 00:10:12,304
creates other sort of verbs, if you will,

185
00:10:12,764 --> 00:10:16,845
that the player is going to perceive as being scripted,

186
00:10:16,985 --> 00:10:17,566
and they're not.

187
00:10:17,646 --> 00:10:20,406
That's the whole beauty of emergent behaviors

188
00:10:20,506 --> 00:10:21,467
and emergent storytelling.

189
00:10:22,527 --> 00:10:22,667
So,

190
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:27,649
About wants, wants can be hidden or inconsistently executed,

191
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:30,010
but the player should be able to learn them in time,

192
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,631
and as I've said, wants make dealing

193
00:10:32,671 --> 00:10:34,032
with needs more interesting.

194
00:10:34,952 --> 00:10:36,773
And I'll show you an example of what I mean by this,

195
00:10:37,233 --> 00:10:39,554
where these sort of things collide,

196
00:10:40,654 --> 00:10:45,617
before we get into the kind of slime wants discussion.

197
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:49,018
So this is one of my favorite moments from Slime Rancher

198
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:49,398
that was...

199
00:10:49,978 --> 00:10:54,520
caught on film on YouTube and this is a demonstration of people sort of learning

200
00:10:55,461 --> 00:11:00,983
the wants and needs in Slime Rancher through discovery. So these guys are eating, the plorts

201
00:11:01,043 --> 00:11:10,566
are being collected. I want to maybe start squirting some hens in here and... Pogo fruit? Oh sorry guys.

202
00:11:14,154 --> 00:11:15,395
I have those ethem as well.

203
00:11:15,415 --> 00:11:16,895
No, no, no, why'd you get sucked out?

204
00:11:17,015 --> 00:11:17,535
How'd you get out?

205
00:11:17,595 --> 00:11:18,916
No, they made like a little thing,

206
00:11:18,936 --> 00:11:19,856
like they're smart brains.

207
00:11:20,036 --> 00:11:21,497
They use their brains to get out.

208
00:11:23,497 --> 00:11:24,958
Get back in there.

209
00:11:24,998 --> 00:11:28,219
All right, our hens are in here.

210
00:11:28,239 --> 00:11:30,600
I don't know if having these guys in a corral

211
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,540
is gonna be good or not.

212
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,901
Wait, they jumped over.

213
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,481
They totally escaped.

214
00:11:34,521 --> 00:11:36,082
They are, it's like they're smart.

215
00:11:36,942 --> 00:11:38,022
Oh, are they trying to get?

216
00:11:39,043 --> 00:11:40,343
That's so cool, man.

217
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:41,724
These guys are smart and they like,

218
00:11:44,382 --> 00:11:46,105
Oh, sorry. Yeah, you guys can hang out in there.

219
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,928
It's like they're trying to get over to the chickens.

220
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:57,380
So you can't hold the food source too close or they'll escape. This game is so interesting!

221
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:07,561
So the great thing about that moment is that you can even watch that, play the game for yourself,

222
00:12:08,081 --> 00:12:13,563
and because of these emergent behaviors that we have, you're going to get your own version of that at some point in the experience.

223
00:12:14,524 --> 00:12:17,665
You might even have that in mind, and it takes you off guard because...

224
00:12:18,345 --> 00:12:22,790
You didn't quite understand just the limits of their stacking behavior and everything

225
00:12:24,072 --> 00:12:30,439
But all most of that is wants the only need that they had in that shot was they wanted that chicken

226
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:36,385
Contrary to at least his belief slimes aren't smart and not by a long shot

227
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:39,409
But they knew they wanted that chicken

228
00:12:39,969 --> 00:12:43,250
and they incorporated their wants, many of them,

229
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:44,711
in order to achieve that.

230
00:12:45,551 --> 00:12:47,472
And so the first one is stacking.

231
00:12:48,973 --> 00:12:51,073
And you may think if you've played the game

232
00:12:51,334 --> 00:12:52,914
that they do this willingly.

233
00:12:52,954 --> 00:12:53,414
They don't.

234
00:12:54,255 --> 00:12:56,716
When slimes are close together, they may attempt to stack.

235
00:12:58,036 --> 00:12:59,957
They can spawn pre-stacked, and that's

236
00:13:00,017 --> 00:13:02,018
sort of our nod to Dragon Quest.

237
00:13:02,538 --> 00:13:06,282
But in the wild, players just sort of look at this behavior

238
00:13:06,342 --> 00:13:09,606
as playing, because almost never in the wild

239
00:13:09,866 --> 00:13:12,729
are slimes seemingly stacking with a purpose.

240
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,694
But on the ranch, it's escaping.

241
00:13:17,094 --> 00:13:20,698
Yes, it is, because they're just in a confined space.

242
00:13:20,918 --> 00:13:23,701
And so naturally, if they're near each other, they stack.

243
00:13:24,253 --> 00:13:25,714
and then they drift towards a corner

244
00:13:25,734 --> 00:13:27,415
because they're a bunch of sphere colliders,

245
00:13:27,815 --> 00:13:29,296
and then when they see a chicken,

246
00:13:30,036 --> 00:13:33,358
they start trying to get to the chicken by stacking

247
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:34,859
because they automatically are doing that.

248
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:35,840
They're like Lego blocks,

249
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,721
and then they come over the top.

250
00:13:39,122 --> 00:13:42,924
So this behavior was really just a happy accident.

251
00:13:43,305 --> 00:13:44,826
The original design for Slime Rancher

252
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:47,527
had them just jumping higher and higher and higher

253
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:48,508
until they would get out.

254
00:13:49,569 --> 00:13:50,790
and that kind of felt cheap.

255
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:51,871
They still do that.

256
00:13:52,772 --> 00:13:55,435
The slimes get bouncier the hungrier they are,

257
00:13:55,896 --> 00:13:59,800
but the stacking is what really sold it.

258
00:14:00,321 --> 00:14:02,843
And it was because the player can then look at that

259
00:14:03,024 --> 00:14:04,485
and say they're cooperating.

260
00:14:04,882 --> 00:14:05,462
but they're not.

261
00:14:05,822 --> 00:14:07,184
They're not at all cooperating,

262
00:14:07,204 --> 00:14:09,906
but the player writes that story for themselves.

263
00:14:10,387 --> 00:14:12,709
And that is our little emergent story

264
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,811
every time slimes are hungry and they wanna get out.

265
00:14:15,851 --> 00:14:16,852
There's also flying,

266
00:14:17,493 --> 00:14:20,235
which is perceived as rescuing a lot of the time.

267
00:14:21,076 --> 00:14:23,098
Foster slimes can fly, simple as that.

268
00:14:23,398 --> 00:14:24,960
But if they're stacked at the time,

269
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,163
they will carry whatever is underneath them away.

270
00:14:28,203 --> 00:14:29,744
And there's really no limit to that.

271
00:14:30,865 --> 00:14:33,186
And this was once again a happy accident.

272
00:14:33,646 --> 00:14:36,668
We knew they could fly and then later we added the stacking

273
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:38,209
and then we just saw one of them

274
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:39,770
carrying his buddy away one day.

275
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,091
We're like this is amazing.

276
00:14:41,892 --> 00:14:44,793
But it used to be that they could just fly infinitely

277
00:14:44,813 --> 00:14:46,474
and every once in a while they still get away with that

278
00:14:46,715 --> 00:14:48,416
and we're kind of okay with it

279
00:14:48,576 --> 00:14:51,217
because it just sort of reads as like

280
00:14:51,377 --> 00:14:52,858
they really wanted to get away.

281
00:14:52,918 --> 00:14:55,760
Like those two are buddies, they're a bonded pair.

282
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,441
they're going to start a life together and that's okay.

283
00:14:59,622 --> 00:15:04,144
So we love this and half of it, like I said, was accidents

284
00:15:04,684 --> 00:15:08,006
and that is sort of half of the player experience as well.

285
00:15:08,346 --> 00:15:09,907
It's going to seem like accidents,

286
00:15:09,987 --> 00:15:11,648
these collisions of things.

287
00:15:13,028 --> 00:15:15,309
And we have some that seem kind of,

288
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,950
they're more subtle, like stealing.

289
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:21,272
A tabby slime, if anybody owns a cat,

290
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:23,233
they'll know every once in a while you find this

291
00:15:23,273 --> 00:15:25,734
treasure trove of bottle caps and other garbage

292
00:15:25,794 --> 00:15:27,635
that they really love.

293
00:15:28,655 --> 00:15:30,076
Tabby slimes do a similar thing.

294
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:35,278
If they find food that they can't eat,

295
00:15:35,658 --> 00:15:37,779
one of their wants that we coded for them is

296
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,340
find food I can't eat.

297
00:15:40,181 --> 00:15:42,447
take it to another location where food is.

298
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:46,919
That is really what makes tabby slimes kind of difficult.

299
00:15:48,044 --> 00:15:51,785
And this plays out in so many different ways

300
00:15:51,925 --> 00:15:53,345
and that's the best part of it.

301
00:15:53,765 --> 00:15:57,147
We didn't make the behavior super obvious.

302
00:15:57,907 --> 00:16:00,428
We didn't add any other layers to it.

303
00:16:00,688 --> 00:16:03,989
By keeping it simple, it's like open connection points.

304
00:16:04,489 --> 00:16:07,450
It allows it to receive the connections

305
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,891
from all these other wants and needs out there.

306
00:16:09,931 --> 00:16:11,791
The more specific you make something,

307
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:13,632
the more limited it's going to be.

308
00:16:14,312 --> 00:16:17,313
So if like tabby slimes only stole carrots.

309
00:16:18,515 --> 00:16:19,096
at night

310
00:16:19,797 --> 00:16:25,828
And blah blah blah like you're the players just going to miss it so you make it as open as possible

311
00:16:26,328 --> 00:16:27,250
in the case of stealing

312
00:16:29,361 --> 00:16:34,286
he's taking food from one food pile basically to another that he's creating.

313
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:39,851
If the player observes that alone, they say, oh look, it's just like a normal cat.

314
00:16:40,471 --> 00:16:46,617
It's hoarding treasure. If other slimes are eating at the food pile at point B,

315
00:16:47,138 --> 00:16:51,682
the player says, oh look, the tabby slimes, they bring food to other slimes. They're so charitable.

316
00:16:52,702 --> 00:16:54,363
If other slimes are eating over here,

317
00:16:54,403 --> 00:16:57,104
they say tabby slimes steal food from other slimes.

318
00:16:57,124 --> 00:16:58,964
They're so sly like that.

319
00:16:59,404 --> 00:17:00,785
And that's the beauty of the system.

320
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,765
They're not interacting with one another.

321
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,726
Slimes just have a want, or a need to eat,

322
00:17:06,806 --> 00:17:07,907
so they're gonna be there anyway.

323
00:17:08,687 --> 00:17:10,547
And sometimes they bring that carrot over,

324
00:17:11,068 --> 00:17:12,328
and that carrot shouldn't be there

325
00:17:12,348 --> 00:17:14,008
because the other food pile was all fruit,

326
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:16,909
and the largos that ate over there

327
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:18,190
then caused a tar outbreak

328
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,910
because we've just introduced foreign matter over there.

329
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:24,673
and so it's, you know, this chain reaction.

330
00:17:26,594 --> 00:17:32,579
Next is explosions, which these probably come the closest

331
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:35,501
to this like highly specific behavior

332
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,542
that doesn't have as many connection points,

333
00:17:38,082 --> 00:17:39,904
but it's really a player hazard.

334
00:17:40,384 --> 00:17:42,005
These slimes are, boom slimes,

335
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:43,686
are designed to be more difficult.

336
00:17:43,807 --> 00:17:44,947
Their plorts are more valuable.

337
00:17:45,852 --> 00:17:47,113
So it's really kind of a balanced thing.

338
00:17:47,214 --> 00:17:53,179
However, its entire purpose is to just impulse things away.

339
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,181
So it's like the tabby behavior,

340
00:17:55,221 --> 00:17:58,024
but it's whatever happens to be around it in all directions.

341
00:17:58,624 --> 00:18:01,407
And that includes actors, that includes resources,

342
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,269
it includes all the pieces.

343
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,730
that drive our emergent behaviors.

344
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,671
Everything in Slime Rancher is just driven by

345
00:18:08,011 --> 00:18:10,292
slimes wanting to, or slimes intersecting

346
00:18:10,332 --> 00:18:11,793
with resources primarily.

347
00:18:12,273 --> 00:18:15,775
And so by adding a slime that booms everything away from it,

348
00:18:18,957 --> 00:18:22,778
just view that as chaos, but it has a very, very specific purpose.

349
00:18:23,178 --> 00:18:27,580
And especially in the wild, it causes things to go where they shouldn't.

350
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,101
So in every, out in the wild, in Slime Rancher,

351
00:18:31,141 --> 00:18:34,562
we like to think of each sort of room that makes up the world as a cell.

352
00:18:35,162 --> 00:18:38,903
And within a cell, our designers will very specifically put

353
00:18:39,824 --> 00:18:42,105
hubs of activity in certain spaces.

354
00:18:42,665 --> 00:18:43,945
And the idea is that...

355
00:18:44,525 --> 00:18:46,486
in the beginning, slimes who want to eat this food

356
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:48,846
and that food and this food kind of stay in that area,

357
00:18:49,147 --> 00:18:50,847
but if you sit in the areas long enough

358
00:18:50,967 --> 00:18:52,407
or you happen to be close to them

359
00:18:52,768 --> 00:18:55,748
and they're live long enough that they're working

360
00:18:56,108 --> 00:18:58,649
while you're not viewing it, cross-pollination occurs.

361
00:18:59,149 --> 00:19:01,050
And so when cross-pollination occurs,

362
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,190
you get the largos and then eventually you get the tar.

363
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,593
So anytime you enter a cell in Slime Rancher

364
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:08,415
and the tar are already overtaking it,

365
00:19:08,795 --> 00:19:10,797
it's because that was sort of cooking in the background

366
00:19:10,877 --> 00:19:12,178
long enough for that to happen.

367
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:14,220
It is never going to just happen.

368
00:19:14,981 --> 00:19:16,242
We don't do it that way.

369
00:19:16,702 --> 00:19:19,785
So stuff like boom slimes that are impulsing things

370
00:19:20,245 --> 00:19:22,988
in all directions are causing that cross-pollination

371
00:19:23,008 --> 00:19:24,489
to happen much, much faster.

372
00:19:25,645 --> 00:19:28,646
And then the final cherry on top for the design

373
00:19:28,766 --> 00:19:29,986
is the backpack itself.

374
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,267
The primary player action in Slime Rancher

375
00:19:33,327 --> 00:19:35,568
causes slimes, food, et cetera, to come together

376
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:38,149
and interact further, encouraging emergent behaviors.

377
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,971
So if all other systems that I just described

378
00:19:42,311 --> 00:19:44,632
completely fall on their ass, we have.

379
00:19:44,992 --> 00:19:46,855
the VACPAC as the great equalizer,

380
00:19:47,235 --> 00:19:48,858
because at the very least,

381
00:19:49,278 --> 00:19:50,760
everything that the player does

382
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,763
in order to drive the action in the game

383
00:19:52,783 --> 00:19:54,065
to accomplish their objectives

384
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:57,130
is bringing slimes and resources together.

385
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,233
And so in doing so...

386
00:19:59,913 --> 00:20:02,674
they're literally just firing off emergent behaviors

387
00:20:02,754 --> 00:20:04,835
if they were to interrupt that process at any point,

388
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,815
which they do when they see something they want,

389
00:20:06,855 --> 00:20:09,136
when they see a gold slime, when a tar attacks them,

390
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:10,556
when they fall off a cliff,

391
00:20:10,596 --> 00:20:12,257
when a tabby slime boops their nose.

392
00:20:12,697 --> 00:20:13,917
Any of those things are designed

393
00:20:13,937 --> 00:20:16,058
to sort of interrupt that action.

394
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,178
We always sort of saw Slime Rancher

395
00:20:18,238 --> 00:20:21,359
as like sort of chaos management,

396
00:20:21,479 --> 00:20:25,020
and this is the reason why the vac tanks are so limited.

397
00:20:26,001 --> 00:20:28,102
is that I want the player to say,

398
00:20:28,242 --> 00:20:29,943
oh I want some of this, oh I'm all full,

399
00:20:30,023 --> 00:20:32,245
oh those guys are about to mix with this,

400
00:20:32,285 --> 00:20:33,025
I don't want that to happen,

401
00:20:33,045 --> 00:20:35,307
so I'll vac them up and just fire them over my shoulder

402
00:20:35,327 --> 00:20:36,948
to get rid of them so I can then get at

403
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:38,009
whatever's happening here.

404
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:41,311
Well in doing so, you're causing more chain reactions

405
00:20:41,351 --> 00:20:42,331
to occur behind you.

406
00:20:42,732 --> 00:20:44,793
So the vac pack really does a great job

407
00:20:44,813 --> 00:20:45,674
of accomplishing this.

408
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,898
So finally, I have a couple of thoughts

409
00:20:52,258 --> 00:20:53,459
on emergent storytelling.

410
00:20:54,704 --> 00:20:55,765
before I wrap up here.

411
00:20:57,567 --> 00:21:00,849
The first one is that only half the story matters.

412
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,373
So not only can these stories be really, really short,

413
00:21:05,854 --> 00:21:07,755
but only half of it actually matters.

414
00:21:08,536 --> 00:21:11,058
Players don't need to observe this chain reaction

415
00:21:11,098 --> 00:21:13,640
or this sequence in its entirety to appreciate it.

416
00:21:14,701 --> 00:21:16,361
In the example of the tabby slime,

417
00:21:17,501 --> 00:21:21,382
just seeing a tabby slime arrive with a carrot in its mouth

418
00:21:21,462 --> 00:21:22,983
to other slimes and drop it there,

419
00:21:23,423 --> 00:21:25,423
they just say, well, a tabby slime came out of nowhere

420
00:21:25,463 --> 00:21:26,504
and started feeding this guy.

421
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,825
Had they observed the first part of that,

422
00:21:29,865 --> 00:21:32,285
they would say, oh wait, no, a tabby slime stole a carrot

423
00:21:32,385 --> 00:21:34,006
from another slime and is giving it to another,

424
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:36,006
so maybe it likes these slimes, I'm not sure.

425
00:21:36,026 --> 00:21:37,747
And if they only saw the beginning,

426
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:40,748
they might view it as the tabby slime stole the carrot

427
00:21:41,288 --> 00:21:45,730
and probably is going to keep it for himself and went off into some place that I didn't see.

428
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:50,231
So there's A, B, C there and it doesn't matter which parts you see, it's a story to you.

429
00:21:51,432 --> 00:21:56,974
They'll figure it out later too when they finally observe that tabby slime take care of it from point A to point B,

430
00:21:57,034 --> 00:22:01,676
they can then start using that information so now when they are corralling tabby slimes,

431
00:22:01,976 --> 00:22:05,097
they have that and they feel rewarded for learning this behavior.

432
00:22:05,237 --> 00:22:10,600
It will still take them by surprise though because the neat thing about wants is they're kind of unreliable.

433
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:15,503
A tabby slime is not going to always steal a carrot,

434
00:22:15,783 --> 00:22:18,004
but a tabby slime when it's hungry will always want to eat.

435
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:20,646
And that kind of takes me back to

436
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:23,628
our needs need to be limited

437
00:22:24,029 --> 00:22:25,970
and they need to be manageable.

438
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,792
Because if they all of a sudden said,

439
00:22:28,832 --> 00:22:30,453
well every time I work with tabby slimes

440
00:22:30,473 --> 00:22:32,114
now I gotta work on this stealing thing

441
00:22:32,134 --> 00:22:33,455
and that it just becomes too much

442
00:22:33,555 --> 00:22:35,516
and you're just managing lists at that point.

443
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:40,179
Finally, players are in on the joke

444
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:42,321
when it comes to emergent storytelling.

445
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:45,423
Emergent behaviors can disrupt the experience,

446
00:22:45,463 --> 00:22:46,944
like truly disrupt the experience.

447
00:22:46,984 --> 00:22:48,986
It can cause the player to die unexpectedly

448
00:22:49,046 --> 00:22:50,087
when they were in the middle of trying

449
00:22:50,107 --> 00:22:51,828
to accomplish an objective, and that sucks.

450
00:22:52,409 --> 00:22:55,251
But it rarely breaks immersion.

451
00:22:56,192 --> 00:22:57,813
In fact, it is often the most memorable

452
00:22:57,853 --> 00:22:58,914
part of the experience.

453
00:23:00,115 --> 00:23:02,017
So an example of that would be if,

454
00:23:03,638 --> 00:23:09,884
you were playing a first-person shooter and an enemy soldier that you had in your sights was just walking, running in place,

455
00:23:10,384 --> 00:23:14,068
screaming that he was going to kill you, but into a wall, walking in place.

456
00:23:14,989 --> 00:23:19,953
That in a way is a sort of emergent behavior because it wasn't intended, but it is flat-out a bug.

457
00:23:20,254 --> 00:23:23,117
It is not contributing to this sort of surprising

458
00:23:23,857 --> 00:23:24,178
event.

459
00:23:25,118 --> 00:23:27,619
So when a player encounters a bug like that,

460
00:23:27,819 --> 00:23:29,359
it pulls them immediately out of the experience.

461
00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:31,560
They immediately say, oh, this game was coded so poorly.

462
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,481
This sucks, the AI in this game is bad.

463
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:39,162
But if instead, let's take a similar sort of broken action

464
00:23:39,602 --> 00:23:41,343
where an enemy soldier's screaming at you,

465
00:23:41,363 --> 00:23:44,264
he's about to kill you, and he goes to throw that grenade,

466
00:23:44,664 --> 00:23:47,244
and another enemy soldier who was trying to come at you

467
00:23:47,284 --> 00:23:49,225
gets in front of it and it bops off of his head

468
00:23:49,325 --> 00:23:50,746
and it lands at the feet of the guy

469
00:23:50,786 --> 00:23:52,866
who immediately threw it, who's still looking seriously

470
00:23:52,926 --> 00:23:54,207
at you and then just explodes.

471
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,727
that's totally kind of a bug,

472
00:23:57,588 --> 00:23:59,788
or at least not at all intended,

473
00:23:59,948 --> 00:24:01,449
and the player will love that.

474
00:24:01,589 --> 00:24:02,969
They will say, they'll either think

475
00:24:03,149 --> 00:24:04,510
they were responsible for it,

476
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,870
they'll think it's hilarious,

477
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:08,751
but the important thing is it had a beginning

478
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:09,711
and a middle and an end.

479
00:24:10,892 --> 00:24:12,812
When the soldier is just running into the wall,

480
00:24:13,072 --> 00:24:15,913
it doesn't have an end, and it just sits there,

481
00:24:15,953 --> 00:24:16,914
it doesn't do anything.

482
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,895
So in Skyrim, for example,

483
00:24:19,915 --> 00:24:22,716
it's like the, you know, if you can...

484
00:24:24,617 --> 00:24:28,020
use these things that seem like bugs as emergent behaviors.

485
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,962
For example, collecting a bunch of townspeople

486
00:24:30,022 --> 00:24:31,324
somehow to fight a dragon.

487
00:24:32,465 --> 00:24:34,427
That was never probably intended,

488
00:24:34,447 --> 00:24:37,310
and it looks ridiculous when the barmaid is swinging a rag

489
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:38,631
trying to kill a dragon.

490
00:24:39,392 --> 00:24:40,752
But again, players love that.

491
00:24:40,852 --> 00:24:43,093
That is like a notch in their belt.

492
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:44,854
That is part of their heroic journey

493
00:24:44,894 --> 00:24:47,975
and it's equal to when they were like climbing up a mountain

494
00:24:48,015 --> 00:24:49,416
and taking on a dragon solo.

495
00:24:49,456 --> 00:24:51,117
They will remember that the most.

496
00:24:51,797 --> 00:24:54,378
So my final takeaway is that your game

497
00:24:54,398 --> 00:24:56,259
will be more memorable, more interesting,

498
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:59,020
and have more variety if you add even a little capacity

499
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,101
for emergent storytelling.

500
00:25:00,221 --> 00:25:03,442
It is one of the few ways games can still truly surprise.

501
00:25:04,743 --> 00:25:05,703
So thank you very much.

502
00:25:13,664 --> 00:25:15,445
I think now we're going to take some questions.

503
00:25:15,645 --> 00:25:17,566
Yeah, just make sure you come up to the mics in the aisles

504
00:25:17,646 --> 00:25:18,166
if you have a question.

505
00:25:18,306 --> 00:25:18,466
Yep.

506
00:25:22,408 --> 00:25:23,748
And while you're asking your question,

507
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:24,849
ignore the giant chicken.

508
00:25:24,889 --> 00:25:27,250
There is no giant chicken, just ignore the giant chicken.

509
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:27,950
I'm the first.

510
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:28,590
All right.

511
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:29,271
All right.

512
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:31,612
Please say your name and where you're from.

513
00:25:31,632 --> 00:25:33,552
My name's Stephen Lumpkin, I'm from Montreal.

514
00:25:33,792 --> 00:25:34,653
Nice to meet you.

515
00:25:34,893 --> 00:25:35,993
You as well, thank you very much.

516
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:43,952
From a production perspective, what do you do when you're talking about how to structure and build?

517
00:25:44,812 --> 00:25:46,494
Man, this echo is like crazy.

518
00:25:47,654 --> 00:25:51,697
So you're trying to plan out what emergent behaviors you want to have happen.

519
00:25:51,857 --> 00:25:57,380
How do you develop that idea and how do you move it into a completed sequence of events the player can discover?

520
00:25:58,191 --> 00:26:02,392
So how do you plan for emergent behaviors in a scene?

521
00:26:02,452 --> 00:26:03,633
How do you build that?

522
00:26:04,593 --> 00:26:08,114
You start with, in the case of Slime Rancher,

523
00:26:08,154 --> 00:26:09,575
we start with a single need.

524
00:26:11,015 --> 00:26:13,376
Slime's only needed to eat in the beginning,

525
00:26:13,776 --> 00:26:15,576
and then you introduce a few wants,

526
00:26:15,656 --> 00:26:18,097
and you see how that plays, and you just grow it.

527
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:21,638
As soon as you have all your needs accounted for, you're good.

528
00:26:22,098 --> 00:26:24,219
and then you basically introduce these wants

529
00:26:24,879 --> 00:26:26,440
and see if it breaks the game.

530
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,121
It's really fun to push it with wants.

531
00:26:30,862 --> 00:26:33,763
The problem with wants though is, per your question,

532
00:26:33,983 --> 00:26:35,983
they're actually pretty difficult to test

533
00:26:36,163 --> 00:26:37,564
and you have to just kind of live in it.

534
00:26:37,884 --> 00:26:38,664
In Slime Rancher we...

535
00:26:39,985 --> 00:26:43,146
have different ranches set up with different mixtures

536
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:45,507
of slimes and we're basically just waiting for

537
00:26:46,507 --> 00:26:47,507
chaos to occur.

538
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:50,268
But my recommendation is get those needs

539
00:26:51,188 --> 00:26:53,809
sorted immediately and it's easy because you'll have

540
00:26:53,849 --> 00:26:56,670
the fewest of them and then have a whole lot of fun

541
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:59,491
introducing wants on top of that and waiting for them

542
00:26:59,531 --> 00:27:00,731
to completely break your game.

543
00:27:00,751 --> 00:27:03,012
And then you just, you dial it just back from that

544
00:27:03,212 --> 00:27:04,513
and you should have a good time with it.

545
00:27:04,913 --> 00:27:07,934
So you start from like, you implement the new behavior

546
00:27:07,974 --> 00:27:09,014
and then you see what happens.

547
00:27:09,792 --> 00:27:12,512
Yeah, the first step is trying to force it to happen.

548
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:15,653
And then we often say, Monami Park,

549
00:27:15,673 --> 00:27:17,013
we're going to live with this for a while.

550
00:27:17,573 --> 00:27:19,153
And you just have to kind of keep it in your head,

551
00:27:19,213 --> 00:27:22,794
like, oh, now tabbies can build robots

552
00:27:22,854 --> 00:27:24,754
when no one's looking and cause robotic cats

553
00:27:24,794 --> 00:27:26,015
to attack people or something like that.

554
00:27:26,055 --> 00:27:26,795
I better remember that.

555
00:27:26,855 --> 00:27:28,595
But the really neat thing is you do forget.

556
00:27:29,175 --> 00:27:30,876
And then you're really surprised

557
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:32,076
when it happens in front of you.

558
00:27:32,156 --> 00:27:33,696
Usually when someone shouts in the office,

559
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,056
then we know it worked.

560
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:37,377
But yeah, get it as close to broken as you can.

561
00:27:37,557 --> 00:27:38,517
Dial it back a little bit.

562
00:27:38,537 --> 00:27:39,097
Thank you.

563
00:27:40,346 --> 00:27:40,686
Thanks.

564
00:27:41,087 --> 00:27:42,948
Hi, I'm Colin McComb, creative lead

565
00:27:42,968 --> 00:27:44,649
for Torment, Ties of Numenera.

566
00:27:44,869 --> 00:27:47,051
My kids wanted me to come and talk to you about this.

567
00:27:48,172 --> 00:27:51,074
You mentioned earlier about multiplayer

568
00:27:51,114 --> 00:27:52,835
being a good emergent experience.

569
00:27:54,036 --> 00:27:56,898
Are you planning on adding multiplayer to Slime Rancher

570
00:27:56,918 --> 00:27:57,739
at any point in the near future?

571
00:28:01,714 --> 00:28:05,557
I think we would love the idea, but as we've said,

572
00:28:06,278 --> 00:28:10,242
Slime Rancher is sort of deceptively resource intensive.

573
00:28:10,802 --> 00:28:14,005
It is up there in, I would wager,

574
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,888
the top five most physics intensive games ever made.

575
00:28:18,249 --> 00:28:19,770
Like it's up there with Kerbal, for sure.

576
00:28:20,711 --> 00:28:23,454
And so because of that, it's really hard to say,

577
00:28:23,574 --> 00:28:24,655
and now we're gonna double that.

578
00:28:25,696 --> 00:28:28,618
So you have to have both clients paying attention to this.

579
00:28:28,658 --> 00:28:30,399
So we're kicking around some ideas.

580
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:31,920
We haven't announced anything yet.

581
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,841
I think, given especially our pedigree,

582
00:28:33,941 --> 00:28:35,122
we would love to do it,

583
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:38,324
but we are very, very cautious about promising anything

584
00:28:38,364 --> 00:28:40,305
because we literally might reach a point

585
00:28:40,445 --> 00:28:41,646
in looking into it where we go,

586
00:28:41,946 --> 00:28:43,307
this is physically impossible

587
00:28:43,627 --> 00:28:47,249
unless you have a Scorpio or something like that.

588
00:28:47,569 --> 00:28:48,730
And that would be a bummer to say,

589
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,011
multiplayer is now available.

590
00:28:51,211 --> 00:28:52,292
10% of Slime Rancher players

591
00:28:52,332 --> 00:28:53,913
can actually experience it, have fun.

592
00:28:54,554 --> 00:28:55,234
So, yeah.

593
00:28:55,254 --> 00:28:56,434
All right, awesome, thank you.

594
00:28:56,574 --> 00:28:56,814
No problem.

595
00:28:56,854 --> 00:28:57,835
My kids totally love the game.

596
00:29:01,556 --> 00:29:01,736
Yes?

597
00:29:01,896 --> 00:29:03,677
Mustafa Haque from Bangladesh.

598
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:10,440
When you observe unexpected behaviors happening via interactions with the system, how do you

599
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,081
determine whether or not it's something you wish to keep or patch out?

600
00:29:16,062 --> 00:29:19,183
So how do we determine if the emergent behavior is a keeper?

601
00:29:20,764 --> 00:29:26,147
Going back to at least my my belief game should be surprising if it will generate a surprise and it will

602
00:29:27,068 --> 00:29:30,129
Generate a surprise maybe in a different way later on it's worth keeping

603
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:37,674
If it really feels like it's breaking the game or every time this thing crops up it kills the players

604
00:29:37,874 --> 00:29:43,118
Progress in some way like it makes it not fun then then we're in trouble, but

605
00:29:44,298 --> 00:29:47,161
I firmly believe in that there's an old roguelike term,

606
00:29:47,181 --> 00:29:48,221
yet another stupid death,

607
00:29:48,742 --> 00:29:51,184
and that is totally applicable to emergent behavior

608
00:29:51,244 --> 00:29:54,886
where if you can make it fun enough to fail,

609
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:56,748
you can keep that in there.

610
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:59,990
But as soon as it just feels cheap, we nix it.

611
00:30:00,651 --> 00:30:03,733
But so far, we really haven't killed too much stuff.

612
00:30:03,873 --> 00:30:06,115
It's just dial it back away from broken,

613
00:30:06,295 --> 00:30:07,336
and it's usually worth keeping.

614
00:30:08,256 --> 00:30:08,597
But also.

615
00:30:09,257 --> 00:30:10,839
connection points, having that interact

616
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,020
with as many other things as possible.

617
00:30:13,301 --> 00:30:15,222
We probably wouldn't design a slime

618
00:30:15,723 --> 00:30:17,404
like the rad slime anymore,

619
00:30:18,185 --> 00:30:20,507
which affects the player, and that was it, pretty much.

620
00:30:20,947 --> 00:30:23,289
You know, the new objective is like,

621
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:26,231
it should interact with as many things as we possibly can.

622
00:30:26,251 --> 00:30:26,832
Yeah.

623
00:30:27,012 --> 00:30:27,332
Thank you.

624
00:30:29,254 --> 00:30:31,215
Okay, yep, so we have to wrap it up,

625
00:30:31,256 --> 00:30:32,437
but I'll be hanging around,

626
00:30:32,537 --> 00:30:34,738
so if anyone has any other questions, I'll be available.

627
00:30:34,778 --> 00:30:35,319
Thank you very much.
