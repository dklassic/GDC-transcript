1
00:00:06,016 --> 00:00:13,704
Everyone, um, we're gonna begin and uh, welcome to Same Game and Different Sounds. Um, if your

2
00:00:13,704 --> 00:00:22,754
phone is not muted, please mute it. Um, and uh, this panel's uh, idea is basically it's a

3
00:00:22,754 --> 00:00:27,399
composer panel with an interesting switch. Um, we were all given a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a

4
00:00:28,055 --> 00:00:35,377
uh... gameplay video that we found and we each composed the video in different style so

5
00:00:35,377 --> 00:00:39,438
we're gonna show what we did uh... talk about the differences and uh...

6
00:00:39,438 --> 00:00:42,019
and how different music and sound can impact uh...

7
00:00:42,019 --> 00:00:44,139
the game. Um... sad...

8
00:00:44,139 --> 00:00:51,001
a bit of a sad news uh... Inonter couldn't make it uh... he had uh... surgery and he's fine

9
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:54,542
everything's fine but uh... his doctors ordered him to stay home

10
00:00:55,236 --> 00:00:59,517
uh... but he sent his video and uh... and we'll see him talking about it in a

11
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:01,438
video

12
00:01:01,438 --> 00:01:03,819
uh... so

13
00:01:03,819 --> 00:01:03,879
uh...

14
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:05,700
guys, hello

15
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,081
why don't you go ahead and introduce yourself

16
00:01:11,081 --> 00:01:15,523
uh... and uh... say your favorite uh...

17
00:01:15,523 --> 00:01:16,603
game audio moment

18
00:01:16,603 --> 00:01:18,464
yeah something you remember from

19
00:01:20,258 --> 00:01:24,340
Becky Allen, I am audio director at PopCap Games.

20
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:30,743
And my favorite moment is in Peggle.

21
00:01:30,743 --> 00:01:33,924
The Peggle moment where everything goes,

22
00:01:33,924 --> 00:01:35,505
da-da-da-da-da, pachow!

23
00:01:35,505 --> 00:01:37,265
Hallelujah!

24
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:39,106
That's my favorite moment.

25
00:01:39,106 --> 00:01:42,228
It still is my favorite moment, sorry.

26
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:43,948
Does it really do that?

27
00:01:43,948 --> 00:01:45,509
Because that was really good.

28
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:46,089
Yeah, yeah, it really does.

29
00:01:46,089 --> 00:01:46,770
Nice.

30
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,411
So, I mean, you know, professional singers.

31
00:01:50,536 --> 00:02:01,561
Hey everybody, my name is Jason Graves. I'm a composer, independent composer, so my favorite.

32
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:08,584
So the most memorable moment for me with music and games was before I started getting into

33
00:02:08,584 --> 00:02:12,846
writing music for games at all, I played the very, very, very, very, very, very, very,

34
00:02:12,846 --> 00:02:17,989
very, very first Medal of Honor that had Michael Giacchino scoring it.

35
00:02:18,755 --> 00:02:23,196
The reason it's so memorable is that's the first time I'd heard

36
00:02:23,196 --> 00:02:25,617
like a live orchestra playing music in a game.

37
00:02:25,617 --> 00:02:27,258
And I'm not a gamer, I'll admit that.

38
00:02:27,258 --> 00:02:30,519
So I have very, very few game experiences.

39
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:32,439
But that one really stuck with me.

40
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,980
And I thought, man, I want to do something like that.

41
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,161
It was very emotional.

42
00:02:36,161 --> 00:02:37,961
And even though it wasn't that interactive,

43
00:02:37,961 --> 00:02:40,202
like just the way the music would play,

44
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:41,863
even if I wasn't doing anything, the music

45
00:02:41,863 --> 00:02:43,163
would start getting more tense.

46
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:48,128
and I'd start feeling myself like tensing up even if I was just walking on a beach or something.

47
00:02:48,128 --> 00:02:51,631
I really loved the relationship of the music to the player's mood

48
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:54,694
and that's always kind of stuck with me from the very beginning.

49
00:02:54,694 --> 00:02:59,259
Were you a musician at the time? Like were you already doing music?

50
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:00,880
Yeah, I was. I think I had done...

51
00:03:02,926 --> 00:03:05,648
like maybe one or two really, really, really small

52
00:03:05,648 --> 00:03:08,670
independent games, but it was all with MIDI.

53
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,952
And the fact that they used live orchestra,

54
00:03:11,952 --> 00:03:13,754
I mean, Steven Spielberg obviously had a lot

55
00:03:13,754 --> 00:03:15,955
to do with that, but that they had live orchestra

56
00:03:15,955 --> 00:03:19,698
and that that could be accomplished within a game

57
00:03:19,698 --> 00:03:22,340
was sort of a meaningful moment for me.

58
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:27,443
All right, I'm Arnold Neses, I've been composing.

59
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:32,672
for games for about seven years and two years ago I started my own company and we're turning

60
00:03:32,672 --> 00:03:37,396
music albums to video games, so it's like a very interactive video clip, but which is

61
00:03:37,396 --> 00:03:40,359
as interactive as a game.

62
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:49,875
Right, so the idea of the panel, as I said before, we chose a pretty random clip on YouTube

63
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:55,037
from an indie game which is called Bright Memory.

64
00:03:55,037 --> 00:03:59,018
I think none of us knows anything about it, including myself.

65
00:03:59,018 --> 00:04:04,901
So we came to this with fresh eyes.

66
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:07,722
And we just got the video as it is.

67
00:04:07,722 --> 00:04:09,462
I'm going to show what we got.

68
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:20,065
Can everybody turn off their cell phones please?

69
00:04:20,065 --> 00:04:22,967
Thank you.

70
00:04:22,967 --> 00:04:31,154
So this is the version that we saw.

71
00:04:31,154 --> 00:04:36,278
And from the little I know about this game, it looks amazing.

72
00:04:36,278 --> 00:04:39,080
As far as I can tell, it is being developed by one guy.

73
00:04:40,341 --> 00:04:46,125
really? It's indie, yeah, it's totally indie. Are you here? Um, like the YouTube description

74
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:53,249
actually says like uh bright memory indie FPS. Uh and uh I think it's uh it's pretty awesome.

75
00:04:53,249 --> 00:04:54,050
Mute the cow please.

76
00:05:13,424 --> 00:05:17,607
It feels so much longer when you watch it without sound.

77
00:05:17,607 --> 00:05:17,807
Yeah.

78
00:05:17,807 --> 00:05:18,288
It's amazing.

79
00:05:18,288 --> 00:05:21,710
I was surprised how quickly it was over when it had the music.

80
00:05:24,695 --> 00:05:31,879
Um right and once we had that um we um basically the the original clip had the music in

81
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:38,803
sound we took it out and we rebuilt everything from scratch so um the sound design was uh done

82
00:05:38,803 --> 00:05:47,228
by uh two great guys um Joe Marchuk and Oscar Cohen um they are well Joe describes himself as

83
00:05:47,228 --> 00:05:50,029
a technical sound designer made of real human meat and uh.

84
00:05:51,983 --> 00:05:57,964
And Oscar describes himself as a sound designer who enjoys making laser guns out of beer cans.

85
00:05:57,964 --> 00:06:02,965
They're both students in Berkeley College of Music and they were kind enough to volunteer

86
00:06:02,965 --> 00:06:04,526
and do the sound.

87
00:06:04,526 --> 00:06:07,686
And this is how the video looked after we had the sound in.

88
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:16,591
And then we stepped in and started doing the music.

89
00:07:16,591 --> 00:07:23,012
So we're just going to show the different versions and discuss them before we show them.

90
00:07:24,293 --> 00:07:26,634
As I said, Inon couldn't make it, so he goes first as a punishment.

91
00:07:26,634 --> 00:07:32,256
But he did send a video of himself talking about it and his considerations and asked us to show it.

92
00:07:32,256 --> 00:07:33,816
Hi everybody. I'm here in my studio and not with you.

93
00:07:33,816 --> 00:07:36,437
And that's quite an unfortunate turn of events, but...

94
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:56,591
I had to go through a surgery, nothing really serious, but my doctors totally ordered me

95
00:07:56,591 --> 00:08:02,873
to stay and to rest for about two weeks after that.

96
00:08:02,873 --> 00:08:06,314
Hopefully I'll get back and play basketball.

97
00:08:06,314 --> 00:08:14,017
Meanwhile I'm here in my studio and welcome you to the amazing panel that these great

98
00:08:14,017 --> 00:08:15,657
composers put together.

99
00:08:15,657 --> 00:08:18,898
And now to talk a little bit about...

100
00:08:19,622 --> 00:08:21,062
my music for this cue.

101
00:08:21,062 --> 00:08:25,703
Basically the way I was looking at it,

102
00:08:25,703 --> 00:08:30,664
I had to create something that is frantic

103
00:08:30,664 --> 00:08:35,485
on one hand, but on the other hand I had to

104
00:08:35,485 --> 00:08:39,586
create something that will be basically going

105
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:43,767
over all the sound effects. And what I

106
00:08:43,767 --> 00:08:47,228
found out that actually sometimes slow melodies

107
00:08:47,605 --> 00:08:57,328
they do the job much better than fast melodies. I also found out that lower drum beats

108
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:03,930
sometimes work a little bit better than all the higher drum beats and the drum sounds because

109
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:10,091
all the sound effects and the shots are sort of like in a more high range. So basically

110
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:13,312
I have chosen this kind of palette.

111
00:09:14,302 --> 00:09:22,288
there are basically the synth palette that is giving us sort of like the bottom and the frantic

112
00:09:22,288 --> 00:09:25,450
part and this is basically the triplets.

113
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:35,818
So this is basically going underneath.

114
00:09:35,818 --> 00:09:42,223
Then there are some effects, orchestral effects.

115
00:09:44,369 --> 00:09:55,099
powerful when it comes to this kind of seed because they are frantic but also

116
00:09:55,099 --> 00:09:57,421
they stand out pretty good.

117
00:10:11,058 --> 00:10:19,144
And this is basically bowed instruments that are playing in a non-traditional way.

118
00:10:19,144 --> 00:10:27,750
And then I definitely put together some sort of like assortment of percussions.

119
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:36,716
But again, these are pretty low and not very basically busy.

120
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:49,194
So basically they're giving just the bottom and the rhythm,

121
00:10:49,194 --> 00:10:53,017
but they're not occupying too much space

122
00:10:53,017 --> 00:10:55,699
because that could be a problem.

123
00:10:55,699 --> 00:11:01,664
And lastly, there is a melody

124
00:11:01,664 --> 00:11:05,067
and the melody is being played by low brass.

125
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:07,189
And the reason why I did it.

126
00:11:07,702 --> 00:11:14,286
was because, again, all the sound effects are sort of like on the higher range,

127
00:11:14,286 --> 00:11:19,889
so this low melody and slow melody definitely standing out pretty good

128
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:24,993
with all the sound effects without getting in the way.

129
00:11:24,993 --> 00:11:27,274
And you can hear the melody here.

130
00:11:37,523 --> 00:11:41,845
Very basic, ominous, but that's the job.

131
00:11:41,845 --> 00:11:44,386
We know that we are in sort of like a,

132
00:11:44,386 --> 00:11:48,268
you know, a very stressed situation.

133
00:11:48,268 --> 00:11:51,770
So we would like actually to give the ominous part

134
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:52,870
to the melodic.

135
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,512
And this is also something, melody is always good

136
00:11:56,512 --> 00:11:57,893
to bring from time to time.

137
00:11:57,893 --> 00:12:01,015
Because then you could just hang on to something,

138
00:12:01,015 --> 00:12:03,836
you could remember something.

139
00:12:03,836 --> 00:12:04,936
And here is all together.

140
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:13,869
So you can hear the bottom part and here's the brass.

141
00:12:13,869 --> 00:12:30,105
Strings are playing the triplets up there but they're not playing all the time so they're

142
00:12:30,105 --> 00:12:33,849
giving us sort of like the excitement but they're not playing all the time so they're

143
00:12:33,849 --> 00:12:35,270
not occupying all the area.

144
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,537
And this is pretty much it.

145
00:12:37,537 --> 00:12:40,622
I wish everybody else lots of luck

146
00:12:40,622 --> 00:12:44,909
and hopefully I can see all of you next time

147
00:12:44,909 --> 00:12:48,615
on both of my feets and running and jumping like always.

148
00:12:48,615 --> 00:12:49,756
See you later.

149
00:12:57,449 --> 00:13:00,770
Yeah, I forgot to talk about Inon at the beginning,

150
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:04,011
but Inon is actually, I'm pretty sure everyone knows him.

151
00:13:04,011 --> 00:13:06,592
He's one of the top composers in the industry.

152
00:13:06,592 --> 00:13:08,613
He did things like Fallout and Dragon Age,

153
00:13:08,613 --> 00:13:15,776
and he's awesome, and he's an Israeli brother, so yay.

154
00:13:15,776 --> 00:13:19,737
Right, so this is how his final version sounds.

155
00:14:30,994 --> 00:14:35,355
All right, Jason.

156
00:14:35,355 --> 00:14:37,215
I have to follow Enon?

157
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,771
So walk us through the process.

158
00:14:44,771 --> 00:14:45,931
What did you think about the video?

159
00:14:45,931 --> 00:14:47,192
How did you approach it?

160
00:14:47,192 --> 00:14:49,553
Well, first of all, I thought it was genius

161
00:14:49,553 --> 00:14:52,554
that literally none of us knew anything about the game,

162
00:14:52,554 --> 00:14:53,234
what it was called.

163
00:14:53,234 --> 00:14:55,195
There was no direction for music whatsoever,

164
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:58,817
and we were really allowed to sort of do our own thing.

165
00:14:58,817 --> 00:15:02,439
So how many composers are in the audience

166
00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:03,259
with a show of hands?

167
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:03,719
Oh, wow.

168
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:03,859
Yes!

169
00:15:03,859 --> 00:15:06,921
All right, and then how many non-composers

170
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:08,241
with a show of hands?

171
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:08,821
Yes!

172
00:15:08,821 --> 00:15:10,422
What about audio directors?

173
00:15:11,183 --> 00:15:13,844
Yeah, alright, there's some audio directors out there.

174
00:15:13,844 --> 00:15:22,127
You know what really struck me about Enon's points is he talked a lot about the mix and

175
00:15:22,127 --> 00:15:26,948
when it comes down to it when you're dealing with a shooter, which so many of these games

176
00:15:26,948 --> 00:15:33,890
have wall-to-wall music with them, it is a big point of contention between the music

177
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:36,511
and the sound effects and the easiest way to fix that.

178
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:41,799
And the hardest way to fix it is to know what the sound effects are going to be before you do the music.

179
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:49,027
A lot of times, the music's running concurrently with gameplay, and the sound effects might be done after the music.

180
00:15:49,027 --> 00:15:52,291
Now, I've worked with some audio directors that will actually...

181
00:15:53,024 --> 00:15:55,427
figure out what key the music's gonna be in,

182
00:15:55,427 --> 00:15:57,269
cause I'll have it in the description of the file,

183
00:15:57,269 --> 00:15:59,831
and they'll purposely pitch the sound effects

184
00:15:59,831 --> 00:16:01,833
to be in the same key as the music,

185
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,857
so that it's sort of a more harmonious balance.

186
00:16:04,857 --> 00:16:06,198
But if you don't have a choice,

187
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:09,702
a lot of times what I end up doing is just

188
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:10,202
no.

189
00:16:10,978 --> 00:16:13,619
or expect that there's going to be gunfire and explosions and swords.

190
00:16:13,619 --> 00:16:17,000
So you've got these sort of two lower mid-range

191
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,660
and upper mid-range kind of telephone frequencies

192
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,901
that you know is going to be occupying space before the music even comes in.

193
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:29,323
So I basically approach this like every other project I've gotten

194
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:31,343
in probably the last five or seven years,

195
00:16:31,343 --> 00:16:33,304
which is a developer comes to me and says,

196
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,361
and it really is this every time.

197
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:38,562
We want a completely original score

198
00:16:38,562 --> 00:16:39,602
that doesn't sound like anything

199
00:16:39,602 --> 00:16:41,863
anyone else has ever done before.

200
00:16:41,863 --> 00:16:43,444
And we want to be able to hear

201
00:16:43,444 --> 00:16:45,785
like five or 10 seconds of the main theme

202
00:16:45,785 --> 00:16:48,086
or of an action cue and for people to recognize

203
00:16:48,086 --> 00:16:50,847
immediately that that's a cue from our game.

204
00:16:50,847 --> 00:16:52,967
Okay.

205
00:16:52,967 --> 00:16:55,628
You know, think something really identifiable

206
00:16:55,628 --> 00:16:57,309
like Raiders of the Lost Ark.

207
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:58,850
But make it unique.

208
00:16:59,653 --> 00:17:04,076
I mean, it's sort of, it's a really, it's a really tall order.

209
00:17:04,076 --> 00:17:08,098
But what I love about that is they're already thinking outside the box in

210
00:17:08,098 --> 00:17:10,560
terms of instruments and sounds.

211
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,703
Um, so with this one, I pretended like they did that as well.

212
00:17:14,703 --> 00:17:20,466
And, um, not knowing what anybody else was doing, I thought, well, probably what the,

213
00:17:20,466 --> 00:17:20,527
uh,

214
00:17:21,742 --> 00:17:26,228
you know sort of and this is nothing against what anyone else's done for

215
00:17:26,228 --> 00:17:31,474
their music I mean I heard Enon's. We haven't heard each other's work. Yeah we don't have any clue.

216
00:17:31,474 --> 00:17:32,976
I'm the only one who has. Oh.

217
00:17:32,976 --> 00:17:34,338
Before or after you wrote yours? After.

218
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:40,624
So, I mean, what would be expected from a track like this?

219
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:45,447
Would be you'd have like maybe some big drums and like the big low brass and maybe a choir

220
00:17:45,447 --> 00:17:51,332
in the background or something and kind of lots of, you know, energy in the track.

221
00:17:51,332 --> 00:17:54,474
So I thought, okay, I'm not going to do any of that for this.

222
00:17:54,474 --> 00:18:00,558
I'm going to do like what could be furthest from orchestra and choir and big drums.

223
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:03,860
So I basically scored it with electric guitars and drum machines.

224
00:18:04,827 --> 00:18:08,149
With the idea that I saw with the enemies, they sort of look

225
00:18:08,149 --> 00:18:10,250
kind of native and low tech.

226
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,352
And you've got all this cool whatever with your samurai

227
00:18:13,352 --> 00:18:14,012
sword and your guns.

228
00:18:14,012 --> 00:18:15,513
And you can fly.

229
00:18:15,513 --> 00:18:18,235
So I thought maybe that would be a nice contrast.

230
00:18:18,235 --> 00:18:21,657
Kind of you're highlighting the technology with the music

231
00:18:21,657 --> 00:18:23,578
that you're using as a player.

232
00:18:23,578 --> 00:18:27,140
And then that way, I've sort of already, the palette of

233
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,241
sounds, if I'm just doing electric guitar and drum

234
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:30,381
machines, is going to.

235
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:35,406
be fairly different from maybe what another composer might work on so then the developer

236
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:42,109
is kind of getting their wish. So how many, how many minutes do I have? Because I've got

237
00:18:42,109 --> 00:18:48,772
a couple of things and I might want to watch the video twice. Okay. Um, why don't we play

238
00:18:48,772 --> 00:18:53,034
the version with the sound effects and then I'll, I'll talk a little bit.

239
00:20:04,555 --> 00:20:09,016
So one of the things that I was really thinking of when I scored it was I was pretending like...

240
00:20:09,016 --> 00:20:10,357
We'll watch it again and you can clap then if you want to.

241
00:20:10,357 --> 00:20:14,978
I was treating it like I was also doing the implementation for the music and that's what

242
00:20:14,978 --> 00:20:17,898
I've done for the last couple of titles that I'm still working on.

243
00:20:17,898 --> 00:20:20,439
I've been doing the implementation as well.

244
00:20:20,439 --> 00:20:25,700
I kind of took my own advice because a lot of people say when I'm starting out in games

245
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,620
what should I do if I want to write music?

246
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,981
I was like, well you need to learn how to implement it.

247
00:20:29,981 --> 00:20:31,121
Then you're sort of...

248
00:20:31,512 --> 00:20:35,355
creating your own job in a way if someone needs sound effects implemented

249
00:20:35,355 --> 00:20:40,599
that's a different talk but it really made me think about this video

250
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:42,921
differently because when I first watched it

251
00:20:42,921 --> 00:20:47,324
I never listened to the sound effects until I emailed you and said like I

252
00:20:47,324 --> 00:20:50,547
don't think I have the sound effects and then I just I just oh and you already

253
00:20:50,547 --> 00:20:54,309
had the music done yeah yeah I didn't listen to the sound effects before I did

254
00:20:54,309 --> 00:20:58,092
the music because normally I don't get to hear them and it's just I was trying

255
00:20:58,092 --> 00:20:59,193
to keep it real man

256
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:04,958
So what I thought was I would do something maybe with a kick drum.

257
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:09,866
and that would give it a little bit of momentum and I'd put it in seven because that would kind of

258
00:21:09,866 --> 00:21:14,949
make it feel like a little hiccupy but still sort of empowering. I didn't want to do anything that

259
00:21:14,949 --> 00:21:20,151
sounded scary or was too ominous or anything like that. I like the idea of the music

260
00:21:20,151 --> 00:21:27,635
making you feel more powerful as a player and kind of urging you on. But I broke it up into

261
00:21:27,635 --> 00:21:32,337
60 seconds. I sort of pretended like this was more like 20 minutes of gameplay and I broke it up into

262
00:21:33,218 --> 00:21:35,661
like eight different sections, which go by super fast

263
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:40,488
but it's more for the point of illustration than anything else. So the guitars are

264
00:21:40,488 --> 00:21:40,949
really

265
00:21:40,949 --> 00:21:44,153
what is maintaining the energy and there's a little hi-hat in the background

266
00:21:44,153 --> 00:21:44,454
just going

267
00:21:44,454 --> 00:21:48,159
tick-a-tick-a-tick-a-tick-a-tick and that that's really it everything else is

268
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:48,980
electric guitars.

269
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:55,393
So from an interactive standpoint, I pretended like we were still in an explore state before

270
00:21:55,393 --> 00:21:56,174
the video started.

271
00:21:56,174 --> 00:21:59,475
And we're going to do another example once I finish talking about this that just has

272
00:21:59,475 --> 00:22:01,897
the music so you can hear it a little bit better.

273
00:22:01,897 --> 00:22:05,919
But there's a, like, reversed drone guitar thing that kind of sounds like a pad.

274
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,460
So that was kind of in your explore state.

275
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,262
And then two seconds in, the camera kind of pans to the right and you see some of the

276
00:22:12,262 --> 00:22:12,743
enemies.

277
00:22:12,743 --> 00:22:14,944
And that's sort of like an enemy spotted trigger.

278
00:22:14,944 --> 00:22:21,828
And that would add in another layer of music that kind of made it getting ready for combat.

279
00:22:21,828 --> 00:22:23,028
That's when the hi-hat comes in.

280
00:22:23,028 --> 00:22:24,369
That's all that comes in.

281
00:22:24,369 --> 00:22:25,329
It's just the hi-hat.

282
00:22:25,329 --> 00:22:30,752
So if you walk away from them or if you don't engage them maybe for 20 seconds, it's just

283
00:22:30,752 --> 00:22:36,015
sort of ticking along and it can loop or bring in different layers and act on its own.

284
00:22:36,596 --> 00:22:40,919
And then at eight seconds, I think maybe you jump first,

285
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:44,241
or no, you do your force push thing on the enemy.

286
00:22:44,241 --> 00:22:46,923
So I kind of considered that like engaging the enemy.

287
00:22:46,923 --> 00:22:50,286
And that's when the other guitars came in.

288
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,647
So the piece of music, action music,

289
00:22:52,647 --> 00:22:55,109
kind of starts in earnest there.

290
00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:56,530
And you can feel it step up,

291
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:00,613
but it's still the same number of layers in the same piece.

292
00:23:01,362 --> 00:23:03,764
that has that ambient music bed underneath it.

293
00:23:03,764 --> 00:23:05,846
So this stuff is systematically stacking up,

294
00:23:05,846 --> 00:23:08,028
kind of like a sandwich.

295
00:23:08,028 --> 00:23:08,848
And at 30 seconds,

296
00:23:08,848 --> 00:23:11,690
there's a slow motion thing that happens,

297
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:15,874
and I don't know what the gameplay reason is for that,

298
00:23:15,874 --> 00:23:18,456
but it seemed like an important sort of moment.

299
00:23:18,456 --> 00:23:20,598
Maybe you're using a cool effect or something.

300
00:23:20,598 --> 00:23:21,578
But also it limited.

301
00:23:21,882 --> 00:23:26,905
the enemies back down to maybe two, there were only like two enemies left. So I consider

302
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:32,647
that, where did I put, only two enemies left. Thin out music but keep persistent pulse.

303
00:23:32,647 --> 00:23:37,409
So the drum machine and the hi-hat and everything that was sort of defining the combat music,

304
00:23:37,409 --> 00:23:44,052
I like to use air quotes, I can't help it. Defining the combat music, that goes away

305
00:23:44,052 --> 00:23:47,154
and I had a little like, kind of a...

306
00:23:48,074 --> 00:23:53,337
fuzzy wah-wah chord sort of guitar sound that came in and kind of picked up the momentum

307
00:23:53,337 --> 00:23:57,479
from the drum machines but it didn't really sound as combat-y. In the music you'll be able to tell

308
00:23:57,479 --> 00:24:02,461
it just gets really clear all the low end drops out and it's I was thinking of focus focus

309
00:24:02,461 --> 00:24:07,323
like you've got two people left it's not as stressful you know just get these two

310
00:24:07,323 --> 00:24:12,286
guys down and then you're you're free and clear and then once all the enemies are gone um.

311
00:24:13,782 --> 00:24:16,105
It's like the next stage in the gameplay.

312
00:24:16,105 --> 00:24:21,732
I've always been a huge fan of forward motion with music.

313
00:24:21,732 --> 00:24:27,499
So if you're in combat for 30 seconds or for five minutes,

314
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:30,762
and then it's a defining point where combat's over and you're

315
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:33,105
moving on, I want the music to change.

316
00:24:34,164 --> 00:24:36,426
I want you to have that reward.

317
00:24:36,426 --> 00:24:42,810
I did this one game based on a film a long time ago called Flushed Away.

318
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,431
It was about rats scurrying around.

319
00:24:44,431 --> 00:24:45,772
But I was so excited.

320
00:24:45,772 --> 00:24:48,874
It was one of the first games that I'd worked on and I got to talk to like Harry Gregson

321
00:24:48,874 --> 00:24:51,756
Williams and he was doing the film score and I was really, really pumped.

322
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:55,319
And I'm only talking about this because it does have reference but we've got a little

323
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:56,139
more time since.

324
00:24:56,139 --> 00:24:58,361
So I'm making up for Enon!

325
00:24:58,361 --> 00:24:59,121
I'll just, you know.

326
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:03,514
So I did this music, but they only had maybe 20 or 25

327
00:25:03,514 --> 00:25:05,756
minutes in the music budget.

328
00:25:05,756 --> 00:25:07,378
It was very, very low budget.

329
00:25:07,378 --> 00:25:10,180
And I think I wrote probably double that, because I always

330
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,902
write more music than is needed.

331
00:25:11,902 --> 00:25:13,683
But even then, I felt like maybe it wasn't enough.

332
00:25:13,683 --> 00:25:16,185
And it was one of the first games I was able to play and

333
00:25:16,185 --> 00:25:17,186
hear my music in it.

334
00:25:17,186 --> 00:25:20,829
So I played for maybe the five minutes on level one, walking

335
00:25:20,829 --> 00:25:21,470
around the kitchen.

336
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:25,271
and you get all these unlockable things and you collect some stuff and then you

337
00:25:25,271 --> 00:25:28,512
there's an obvious point where you move on to the next room.

338
00:25:28,512 --> 00:25:32,873
I was like, sweet! I had no idea where the music was gonna go. It was very much like,

339
00:25:32,873 --> 00:25:36,314
you know, we need five exploration cues and five cues based on this. None of it

340
00:25:36,314 --> 00:25:37,114
was based on

341
00:25:37,114 --> 00:25:39,795
gameplay. So I was experiencing the music for the first time.

342
00:25:39,795 --> 00:25:44,616
After five minutes I get into the next room and the same piece of music starts

343
00:25:44,616 --> 00:25:45,636
playing again.

344
00:25:45,636 --> 00:25:50,017
And it was such... I just kinda like melted in my chair. I was like,

345
00:25:50,017 --> 00:25:50,397
Really?

346
00:25:51,694 --> 00:25:55,796
I mean, and so I went through and I played it, and then the next room, the same piece

347
00:25:55,796 --> 00:25:59,457
of music, and it's like a 60 second loop, and it just played and played and played and

348
00:25:59,457 --> 00:25:59,677
played.

349
00:25:59,677 --> 00:26:05,139
So I've sort of been obsessive about not having that happen again, no matter what, like I

350
00:26:05,139 --> 00:26:05,899
want to make sure.

351
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:06,739
Ever, ever, ever.

352
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:09,700
Like we're forward, forward movement.

353
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,721
So that's why I did a key change.

354
00:26:11,721 --> 00:26:12,501
It's about 40 seconds in.

355
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:14,502
When all the enemies are gone.

356
00:26:15,322 --> 00:26:19,726
I did a very obvious key change, like down a minor third or something, so it feels completely

357
00:26:19,726 --> 00:26:20,186
fresh.

358
00:26:20,186 --> 00:26:25,850
And in my head, that's sort of like you're back to explore mode, but there's danger.

359
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:30,574
So it's not going back to the just quiet pad with, you know, ambient sounds.

360
00:26:30,574 --> 00:26:35,177
It's still got pulse going on, and it's still in 7, so it's automatically sort of giving

361
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:36,238
you that momentum.

362
00:26:39,616 --> 00:26:41,300
Still in combat mode, energy high.

363
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,706
Oh, and then the second big slow motion thing

364
00:26:43,706 --> 00:26:45,791
was the dragon flying by, which was so awesome.

365
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:49,271
I figured if the video slowed down right there for the gameplay,

366
00:26:49,271 --> 00:26:52,013
that maybe that would be a good place to emphasize something as well.

367
00:26:52,013 --> 00:26:55,214
So there's like a stinger there, basically, that just kind of,

368
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:58,236
the music slows down briefly while the dragon's flying by.

369
00:26:58,236 --> 00:27:01,838
And then at the very end, I mean, it just sort of stops,

370
00:27:01,838 --> 00:27:06,781
but I pretended like maybe you had just finished that chapter or that point,

371
00:27:06,781 --> 00:27:09,502
and something came up that said, like, great job, we're moving on,

372
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:10,863
and I put a stinger on it.

373
00:27:11,604 --> 00:27:15,907
So, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, I've got seven,

374
00:27:15,907 --> 00:27:18,910
seven things in there that really I can't help it now

375
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:21,271
because I've been composing knowing

376
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:24,514
that I'm implementing this music myself in these other games.

377
00:27:24,514 --> 00:27:26,516
So I couldn't help but put the music

378
00:27:26,516 --> 00:27:28,798
for this demo together that same sort of way.

379
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:30,899
And I, you know, really did it that way.

380
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,040
There's not a lot going on.

381
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:36,784
It's maybe three guitar tracks and the drum machine track

382
00:27:36,784 --> 00:27:39,306
and then some of the stingers are like some swooshes

383
00:27:39,306 --> 00:27:40,027
or hits or something.

384
00:27:40,804 --> 00:27:45,125
But I love the idea of lean and mean and having the music be really nimble

385
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:51,486
Like a musical ninja kind of jumping around and you're not committing yourself to these big long 30 or 60 second loops

386
00:27:51,486 --> 00:27:58,408
Where if you want to kind of come back around to the beginning it sort of feels like you're starting over again

387
00:27:58,408 --> 00:28:00,288
It was more about

388
00:28:00,288 --> 00:28:06,490
Keeping it changing as much as possible, and I thought the reverse guitar thing at the end was kind of a cool

389
00:28:07,306 --> 00:28:14,391
alien, you know, kind of sounded a little foreign, sounded a little familiar but different.

390
00:28:14,391 --> 00:28:14,591
Yeah.

391
00:28:14,591 --> 00:28:15,091
Awesome.

392
00:28:15,091 --> 00:28:20,075
So, if the developer would approach you and say like, hey, this is my game, what do I

393
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:20,715
do with music?

394
00:28:20,715 --> 00:28:22,417
You would tell them to go with that, right?

395
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:27,376
Well, if it's a game like that, I would say yes.

396
00:28:27,376 --> 00:28:28,057
This game, right?

397
00:28:28,057 --> 00:28:32,563
He approaches, he says, this is a short video, what should I do with this?

398
00:28:32,563 --> 00:28:34,065
Absolutely, yeah, adaptive.

399
00:28:34,065 --> 00:28:39,071
And a lot of times, even I will write, let's say that this was going to be, normally I'd

400
00:28:39,071 --> 00:28:41,254
do maybe a five minute piece of music.

401
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:44,097
would be, you know, combat track one or something like that.

402
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,560
And it would have the ambient layers and kind of the middle

403
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,862
of the road layers and the key changes in it.

404
00:28:48,862 --> 00:28:52,085
Probably every 30 seconds, because I'm just, I like to

405
00:28:52,085 --> 00:28:54,528
have a very short attention span, every 30 seconds

406
00:28:54,528 --> 00:28:55,389
something's changing.

407
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:58,651
And I've been doing this a lot lately.

408
00:28:58,651 --> 00:29:02,393
I'll write a five or eight minute suite, and then I end

409
00:29:02,393 --> 00:29:04,314
up implementing that as adaptive music.

410
00:29:04,314 --> 00:29:07,815
But there are all these 30 to 45 second points where there's

411
00:29:07,815 --> 00:29:11,396
definite changes, and they're built in loop points.

412
00:29:11,396 --> 00:29:15,258
And within those 30 or 45 second loop points, I'll have

413
00:29:15,258 --> 00:29:16,538
doubled up on certain things.

414
00:29:16,538 --> 00:29:19,039
If it's this track, I would probably have three drum

415
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:19,739
machine tracks, maybe.

416
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:28,287
One's got the kick drum, one's got the hi-hat, maybe another sort of mid-level thing, and then I'll do that again times three, but none of them would ever play at the same time.

417
00:29:28,287 --> 00:29:37,495
They'd be kind of taking one and then this one, and then that one goes in, and they'd randomly go in and out when the loop occurs.

418
00:29:37,495 --> 00:29:40,838
So it doesn't really sound like a loop, it just sounds like you're going to the next section.

419
00:29:40,838 --> 00:29:44,161
And that's all very kind of heady and...

420
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:47,083
abstract sort of ways to explain it.

421
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:48,344
But it is cool.

422
00:29:48,344 --> 00:29:51,806
I mean, FMOD and Wwise are free to download.

423
00:29:51,806 --> 00:29:53,167
And there's tutorials online.

424
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:54,268
And there's videos.

425
00:29:54,268 --> 00:29:57,130
And it's one of those things, if you start working with it,

426
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,171
especially earlier in your career.

427
00:29:59,171 --> 00:30:01,693
I did it very late in mine.

428
00:30:01,693 --> 00:30:04,234
But I just realized you start learning how to do it.

429
00:30:04,234 --> 00:30:06,175
And it kind of becomes ingrained in your psyche.

430
00:30:06,175 --> 00:30:08,497
And when you're writing, you can't help but think about how

431
00:30:08,497 --> 00:30:09,478
it's going to be implemented.

432
00:30:09,478 --> 00:30:11,679
And I think that, I mean, it can't be a bad thing.

433
00:30:12,126 --> 00:30:16,490
Meghi, before we continue, would you agree with the adaptive...?

434
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:17,431
Absolutely.

435
00:30:17,431 --> 00:30:23,818
And I think that once you're implementing, which I highly suggest to all composers, it

436
00:30:23,818 --> 00:30:29,203
helps you write differently because you're thinking about the game, you're thinking about

437
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:33,067
gameplay, you're thinking about different emotional states.

438
00:30:33,568 --> 00:30:38,134
And no matter where you started or how you're educated,

439
00:30:38,134 --> 00:30:40,818
it will affect how you write your cues.

440
00:30:40,818 --> 00:30:46,205
So I think everyone here should go home and learn WISE or FMOD.

441
00:30:46,205 --> 00:30:49,449
If you don't know it already, even if you're a freelance

442
00:30:49,449 --> 00:30:50,871
or you think that's your path.

443
00:30:51,472 --> 00:30:57,277
It's something that I think we need to move forward with in the industry, as composers in particular.

444
00:30:57,277 --> 00:31:06,907
Because I know that there are a lot of composers that don't do that, but I think it really does change how you compose, it betters the game and the audio experience.

445
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:07,988
So, yes, I agree.

446
00:31:07,988 --> 00:31:11,371
It's not just about interactivity either, it's about avoiding repetition.

447
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:14,194
Because let's face it, repetition is like the death of game music.

448
00:31:14,922 --> 00:31:16,724
That's the worst thing in the world.

449
00:31:16,724 --> 00:31:21,888
So you can have one piece of music, maybe it's looped for five minutes and it's only

450
00:31:21,888 --> 00:31:25,911
30, maybe not 30 seconds long, but it's played like five or six times in the loop.

451
00:31:25,911 --> 00:31:29,033
But if you know how to implement and then you're thinking about that from a composition

452
00:31:29,033 --> 00:31:29,594
standpoint.

453
00:31:30,314 --> 00:31:35,259
I've just hit play and walked away and I've let something go for 20 minutes and I never felt like,

454
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:40,665
oh yeah, here we go again. It's constantly recycling. There's all this randomness and

455
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:44,469
effects and things you can have, like more enemies. I'm going to increase the distortion

456
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:48,694
in wise on my drum track because there's more enemies and that's actually happening

457
00:31:48,694 --> 00:31:52,718
outside of anything that you've written. That's happening in real time in the engine.

458
00:31:53,336 --> 00:31:56,957
And those kind of choices that you make within Wwise or Fmod

459
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:58,777
are compositional choices.

460
00:31:58,777 --> 00:32:00,078
Those are creative choices.

461
00:32:00,078 --> 00:32:02,658
So if you're just handing off your tracks,

462
00:32:02,658 --> 00:32:04,559
you're missing out on all this creativity.

463
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,700
And I think, personally, I find that a very exciting place

464
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,260
to work.

465
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,600
If you need to describe the feeling you

466
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:15,462
were trying to support in the video in one word or two words,

467
00:32:15,462 --> 00:32:16,262
what would it be?

468
00:32:16,262 --> 00:32:17,422
Empowerment.

469
00:32:17,422 --> 00:32:18,262
The main empowerment.

470
00:32:18,262 --> 00:32:19,523
Empowerment, yeah.

471
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:20,503
With the air quotes.

472
00:32:20,503 --> 00:32:21,503
With the air quotes, yeah.

473
00:32:21,503 --> 00:32:21,843
Yes.

474
00:32:22,928 --> 00:32:24,450
Alright, awesome.

475
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:27,913
Cool, so...

476
00:32:27,913 --> 00:32:28,854
Yeah, yeah.

477
00:32:28,854 --> 00:32:33,198
Or play it, you can just play it without the sound effects.

478
00:32:33,198 --> 00:32:34,560
Oh, we didn't, right.

479
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:34,940
Music only.

480
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,581
Yeah, music only.

481
00:32:35,581 --> 00:32:37,663
And just think about these key points,

482
00:32:37,663 --> 00:32:39,625
like the six or seven points that I was talking about.

483
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:41,006
You'll hear the music change.

484
00:33:58,466 --> 00:34:01,547
Right, now I need to follow that.

485
00:34:01,547 --> 00:34:02,047
This is gonna be fun.

486
00:34:02,047 --> 00:34:08,249
Right, so for me this was a bit of a weird video

487
00:34:08,249 --> 00:34:10,750
because it kind of went against every instinct

488
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:11,550
I usually have.

489
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:18,452
So the first panel I ever did as a composer's panel,

490
00:34:18,452 --> 00:34:20,132
we were talking about adaptive music

491
00:34:20,132 --> 00:34:22,873
and I was the first one to answer the question.

492
00:34:22,873 --> 00:34:24,874
So the guy was moderating, asked like,

493
00:34:24,874 --> 00:34:26,234
what are your thoughts about adaptive?

494
00:34:26,234 --> 00:34:28,095
And I said like, it's kind of a bit like.

495
00:34:28,538 --> 00:34:32,382
a rush to the goal, you know, where a lot of developers want to go that way, but not

496
00:34:32,382 --> 00:34:36,446
all games need it, and I was kind of... and then it turned out that the other guy on the

497
00:34:36,446 --> 00:34:39,189
panel had his own, like, adaptive software company.

498
00:34:39,189 --> 00:34:44,554
So it became, like, a whole argument about adaptive.

499
00:34:44,554 --> 00:34:46,496
And usually I'm...

500
00:34:46,496 --> 00:34:49,299
I wouldn't say that I'm not a big fan, but I...

501
00:34:50,999 --> 00:34:52,640
I'm very careful with adaptive.

502
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:57,742
Like I ask myself and the developer a lot of times before I go adaptive, does this game

503
00:34:57,742 --> 00:34:58,362
really need it?

504
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:03,244
Because like, I don't know, a story driven telltale game usually can do without.

505
00:35:03,244 --> 00:35:07,205
And there is a downside to adaptive, at least the way I feel is that there is much less

506
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:08,125
control of the music.

507
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:09,006
You know what I mean?

508
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:09,326
It's like...

509
00:35:10,527 --> 00:35:14,887
it creates a whole new way of composing and a whole new way of

510
00:35:14,887 --> 00:35:18,048
listening to music and creating music which doesn't exist anywhere outside of

511
00:35:18,048 --> 00:35:19,268
video games

512
00:35:19,268 --> 00:35:22,869
but you don't always even know how it's gonna sound right you don't

513
00:35:22,869 --> 00:35:26,630
you're not sure how when the motive's gonna come in you're not sure

514
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:30,571
like you're kinda releasing it out there and it's always a really scary moment

515
00:35:30,571 --> 00:35:31,931
for me where you go like

516
00:35:31,931 --> 00:35:35,112
this is the adaptive music please be good

517
00:35:36,687 --> 00:35:41,390
then you're playing the build for the first time and usually it's cool but it's a very scary

518
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:48,554
moment for me. Um but at the same time that I was working with this um uh I also teach a

519
00:35:48,554 --> 00:35:55,319
composing course in uh in Israel and uh and we were talking about adaptive and then I saw this

520
00:35:55,319 --> 00:36:00,062
video and I thought like this this is the one moment I would definitely go adaptive. Um this

521
00:36:00,062 --> 00:36:04,204
is exactly the game where where this needs to happen. Um.

522
00:36:04,982 --> 00:36:10,487
And the second thing is that usually I kinda, uh, I'm on the side of, you know, supporting

523
00:36:10,487 --> 00:36:15,891
the story first of all and the feeling and like asking, always asking the developer what, what

524
00:36:15,891 --> 00:36:21,296
should, like, what do you want or the game designer, probably the more correct person, like,

525
00:36:21,296 --> 00:36:27,301
what do you want the player to feel at the same time, right? Because, um, and here I was

526
00:36:27,301 --> 00:36:28,622
like, alright, so there is like...

527
00:36:29,407 --> 00:36:36,015
guns and swords and zombies or whatever they are and the dragon and we're walking and it

528
00:36:36,015 --> 00:36:41,802
kind of felt like this whole salad of things that someone mostly wanted it to look cool

529
00:36:41,802 --> 00:36:47,129
like it's done really really well but I feel it's like a bit over the limit you know what

530
00:36:47,129 --> 00:36:47,910
I mean like it's

531
00:36:48,736 --> 00:36:54,098
it's like let's take every cool element that has ever been tried in a video game and pull

532
00:36:54,098 --> 00:37:01,720
them all together and make a whole thing out of it. Um so I kind of went with uh the extreme

533
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:07,122
for my version um uh so I was kind of thinking okay I should take like

534
00:37:08,942 --> 00:37:15,865
not the most expected genres here and they have to be cool and they have to be like um you said

535
00:37:15,865 --> 00:37:20,327
that they need like you wanted the guitar at the end to feel different so I was kind of

536
00:37:20,327 --> 00:37:29,872
thinking maybe something oriental or you know not the totally western sound. Um and adaptive. So

537
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:36,015
yeah and I was kind of thinking what Elias can do. We talked about F mod and W wise but um

538
00:37:36,816 --> 00:37:39,778
at my course we were talking at Elias at the same time so I was

539
00:37:39,778 --> 00:37:44,742
thinking like I'm gonna look what Elias can do and uh and try to build something

540
00:37:44,742 --> 00:37:52,088
that will work uh to show the the students as well. Um and yeah so I'm

541
00:37:52,088 --> 00:37:54,330
warning this went a bit extreme but

542
00:38:57,421 --> 00:39:04,125
Thank you.

543
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:08,849
So yeah, this is also, like you said, pretty much the same like same points you have the

544
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:11,891
exploration at the beginning where you're walking and

545
00:39:12,046 --> 00:39:15,328
not much happens and then you see the enemies so the music becomes

546
00:39:15,328 --> 00:39:21,453
more intense. The dragon obviously is a sync point that I think all of us

547
00:39:21,453 --> 00:39:25,677
used. And also there was this moment where everything becomes pink

548
00:39:25,677 --> 00:39:30,340
that I kinda felt it's the power up or something so I thought of that as

549
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:34,764
a bit of a different layer and

550
00:39:34,764 --> 00:39:37,706
yeah. Alright. Becky?

551
00:39:37,706 --> 00:39:39,988
Yeah. You have mine there too?

552
00:39:46,733 --> 00:39:52,139
So I'll just confess I wasn't paying attention when we chose

553
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:55,202
the clip, and so it's interesting when I looked at

554
00:39:55,202 --> 00:39:57,044
the clip, I'm like, oh, it's action.

555
00:39:57,807 --> 00:39:59,207
Okay, awesome.

556
00:39:59,207 --> 00:40:01,068
It's Tom's photo, originally.

557
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:01,628
Tom's photo.

558
00:40:01,628 --> 00:40:03,248
Oh, it's so a Tom choice.

559
00:40:03,248 --> 00:40:06,749
And then he really insisted on picking this video

560
00:40:06,749 --> 00:40:08,930
and just went away.

561
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:11,131
He was like, this is the video.

562
00:40:11,131 --> 00:40:11,991
Thank you, Tom.

563
00:40:11,991 --> 00:40:13,872
Right, bye guys.

564
00:40:13,872 --> 00:40:16,252
So when I paid attention and I looked at the video

565
00:40:16,252 --> 00:40:19,713
I'm like, oh my God, I've never written in this genre.

566
00:40:20,354 --> 00:40:20,914
But I'm game.

567
00:40:20,914 --> 00:40:22,615
I'm going to do this.

568
00:40:22,615 --> 00:40:23,855
Sure.

569
00:40:23,855 --> 00:40:26,096
And then I'm like, OK, well, I guess I'll do something weird

570
00:40:26,096 --> 00:40:30,859
and non-actiony, although it ended up a little actiony, I

571
00:40:30,859 --> 00:40:33,200
have to say.

572
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,522
But then I come from CalArts background, so highly

573
00:40:36,522 --> 00:40:37,142
experimental.

574
00:40:37,142 --> 00:40:41,204
But in the last few years, I've been doing really cute

575
00:40:41,204 --> 00:40:42,384
music over at PopCap.

576
00:40:42,384 --> 00:40:44,465
And that's been really fun.

577
00:40:44,465 --> 00:40:49,068
But I kind of hearken back to, oh, I really like shapes.

578
00:40:50,251 --> 00:40:52,932
I like sound masses.

579
00:40:52,932 --> 00:40:53,733
I like Penderecki.

580
00:40:53,733 --> 00:40:56,154
I like Ligeti and those kinds of things.

581
00:40:56,154 --> 00:41:00,356
So I was like, I want sound shapes, so I'm just going to start thinking about that.

582
00:41:00,356 --> 00:41:00,836
So I got out.

583
00:41:00,836 --> 00:41:09,220
I thought, I need like those kind of extended technique types.

584
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:17,226
sounds and yet at the same time I'm gonna work with what I have. Um so I had spitfire string

585
00:41:17,226 --> 00:41:24,512
quartet, I had some other sample libraries, I have a profit 12, um I'm like I'm gonna use those

586
00:41:24,512 --> 00:41:31,198
things. So, so then I like um I started like listening through the sounds to be like I'm gonna

587
00:41:31,198 --> 00:41:38,163
also not only think of shape but I'm gonna come from the sound up. So um listen to the sounds,

588
00:41:38,503 --> 00:41:39,984
see what they might inspire.

589
00:41:39,984 --> 00:41:42,966
Because remember, this is not in my wheelhouse,

590
00:41:42,966 --> 00:41:44,987
so I don't have like any kind of,

591
00:41:44,987 --> 00:41:46,928
not that anybody here has a formula,

592
00:41:46,928 --> 00:41:50,490
but I'm like, don't know.

593
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:54,153
So, listening to the sounds, choosing the sounds,

594
00:41:54,153 --> 00:41:56,074
and thinking about sound shapes.

595
00:41:56,074 --> 00:42:00,477
So, I found some really cool articulations in the strings,

596
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:02,018
and then I would like put it on a track.

597
00:42:02,018 --> 00:42:03,579
I was using Pro Tools.

598
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,321
uh... i put on track and i'd make this test blob of black

599
00:42:08,321 --> 00:42:12,442
that stuff

600
00:42:12,442 --> 00:42:14,283
and i'm like oh that's cool

601
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:16,864
it's kind of like insects

602
00:42:16,864 --> 00:42:17,964
so i'm like oh yeah i like that

603
00:42:17,964 --> 00:42:21,685
and so then i was looking for that kind of stuff and i put these like blobs in

604
00:42:21,685 --> 00:42:25,807
different spots that i thought blobs should go

605
00:42:25,807 --> 00:42:28,168
i really do come from a formal training so it's uh... yeah

606
00:42:28,168 --> 00:42:31,169
it doesn't sound like it at the moment

607
00:42:33,225 --> 00:42:34,966
But I thought, you know, this is good.

608
00:42:34,966 --> 00:42:36,667
I'm coming from a place of shape.

609
00:42:36,667 --> 00:42:39,228
And then I started thinking about the shape of the video

610
00:42:39,228 --> 00:42:41,589
and the different points like you were talking about

611
00:42:41,589 --> 00:42:42,650
and you were talking about as well.

612
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:46,252
Like where are the markers of change, right?

613
00:42:46,252 --> 00:42:49,553
Because we all do adaptive music of some kind.

614
00:42:49,553 --> 00:42:51,854
Like where are those moments where I want to change

615
00:42:51,854 --> 00:42:54,896
in the melody or the feel or something like that?

616
00:42:54,896 --> 00:42:58,798
So I chose those hand blast type moments, you know,

617
00:42:58,798 --> 00:43:00,899
as the shape shifters.

618
00:43:02,065 --> 00:43:08,230
And, um, I also emphasized them with some other weird sounds that I found.

619
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:12,634
You know, and, um, added to the sounds that the sound designers made.

620
00:43:12,634 --> 00:43:14,796
Um, sorry, sound designers.

621
00:43:14,796 --> 00:43:21,742
Um, and then I had all that going and I'm like, okay, but this is action.

622
00:43:21,742 --> 00:43:21,842
So.

623
00:43:22,422 --> 00:43:23,863
I'm gonna throw in a taiko drum.

624
00:43:23,863 --> 00:43:26,185
Woo!

625
00:43:26,185 --> 00:43:27,446
Which I did.

626
00:43:27,446 --> 00:43:34,551
And I did use low brass so in the middle section I'm like, it has shape but I also want it

627
00:43:34,551 --> 00:43:40,215
to, but I'm gonna, I'm gonna pay homage to the action cue and I want it to have a big

628
00:43:40,215 --> 00:43:41,576
payoff.

629
00:43:41,576 --> 00:43:43,117
Okay, big payoff.

630
00:43:43,117 --> 00:43:48,681
So I chose my like peak of the cue, I'm like the three quarter mark in the traditional

631
00:43:48,681 --> 00:43:48,841
sense.

632
00:43:48,841 --> 00:43:48,942
Bam!

633
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:52,199
and then it drifts back.

634
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:54,761
So it's kind of like an A, B, A.

635
00:43:54,761 --> 00:43:55,742
Again, to the shape.

636
00:43:55,742 --> 00:44:00,346
So, conceptually, coming from ideas of shape

637
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,467
and sound and structure,

638
00:44:02,467 --> 00:44:05,710
and then also working with the actual sounds that I had,

639
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:06,911
and then I built this thing.

640
00:44:06,911 --> 00:44:09,112
Amazing trick.

641
00:44:09,112 --> 00:44:09,633
Ha ha ha. ♪♪

642
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:31,290
Thanks for watching!

643
00:45:16,167 --> 00:45:19,231
I love it.

644
00:45:24,127 --> 00:45:26,188
And you say you haven't done action before.

645
00:45:26,188 --> 00:45:26,669
That was great!

646
00:45:26,669 --> 00:45:32,093
The dragon is an interesting point because two of us made the music go even higher on the dragon,

647
00:45:32,093 --> 00:45:36,676
like Jason and Dinan, and the two of us just dropped the music.

648
00:45:36,676 --> 00:45:39,218
I did it because I wanted to get this effect of, you know, like...

649
00:45:40,421 --> 00:45:40,901
Right, yeah.

650
00:45:40,901 --> 00:45:41,821
Like, holy shit.

651
00:45:41,821 --> 00:45:41,861
Oh!

652
00:45:41,861 --> 00:45:42,822
Yeah.

653
00:45:42,822 --> 00:45:45,422
Me too, I want to feel different there.

654
00:45:45,422 --> 00:45:51,904
And it's like a trick that actually a lot of, like, is being used really often and it

655
00:45:51,904 --> 00:45:53,104
really works well.

656
00:45:53,104 --> 00:45:59,605
Like in Lord of the Rings when Rohan attacks, like, there is like the whole main theme and

657
00:45:59,605 --> 00:46:03,606
then the moment the two armies collide they go like nothing.

658
00:46:03,606 --> 00:46:03,866
Right.

659
00:46:03,866 --> 00:46:06,527
Like, when do you use silence or when do you back off to let something else happen?

660
00:46:06,527 --> 00:46:07,187
Like a feeling, you know?

661
00:46:07,187 --> 00:46:07,627
Yeah.

662
00:46:07,627 --> 00:46:08,447
Alright, cool.

663
00:46:08,982 --> 00:46:11,504
So, what was the original like?

664
00:46:11,504 --> 00:46:15,569
Oh yeah, that'll be interesting.

665
00:46:15,569 --> 00:46:18,231
Oh, there's a music score to the original?

666
00:46:18,231 --> 00:46:18,692
Yeah.

667
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:19,593
Cool, who did that?

668
00:46:19,593 --> 00:46:22,255
I don't know, I've been looking.

669
00:46:22,255 --> 00:46:24,418
Yeah, I actually, I wanted to apologize about it.

670
00:46:24,418 --> 00:46:29,042
Like, I think he's awesome and I have no idea who he is.

671
00:46:29,042 --> 00:46:32,126
If you know who he is, let us know.

672
00:46:32,126 --> 00:46:32,886
Or she.

673
00:46:33,488 --> 00:46:39,813
Yeah, I, the developer's name I, I think is Zeng Xiancheng, I pretty sure I'm not

674
00:46:39,813 --> 00:46:43,416
pronouncing it correctly but uh, I'm not sure where the music is from, it can be stock

675
00:46:43,416 --> 00:46:46,538
music or, I, I tried to find out but I didn't.

676
00:47:47,591 --> 00:47:55,196
They also took the music out with the dragon.

677
00:47:55,196 --> 00:48:03,780
But yeah, it's interesting because I don't know, to me it's kind of, the original felt

678
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:08,783
like a lot of elements that each of us kind of emphasized and there it's like.

679
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:12,561
know a lot of the things together. You know what I mean?

680
00:48:12,561 --> 00:48:21,585
Alright cool. Um so let's uh talk a little. Um I have uh two

681
00:48:21,585 --> 00:48:24,366
things I I prepared questions but I don't think we have enough

682
00:48:24,366 --> 00:48:28,928
time we're just gonna uh let the people ask questions. But um one

683
00:48:28,928 --> 00:48:33,710
question I I thought was um interesting in this case is um

684
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:36,771
so obviously like it's it's very different right? It's uh

685
00:48:36,771 --> 00:48:36,952
every

686
00:48:37,577 --> 00:48:43,981
Seeing the same thing with different music makes you feel really different and each time I'm doing this panel

687
00:48:43,981 --> 00:48:49,485
I'm really surprised by like how many options there are you know what I mean like I always come in thinking like

688
00:48:49,485 --> 00:48:55,388
With this video it's gonna sound exactly the same everyone are gonna do exactly the same thing and then I keep getting surprised

689
00:48:56,289 --> 00:49:05,076
So, um, the question is, um, do you think there is a right answer? Do you think the, how would,

690
00:49:05,076 --> 00:49:09,719
like, if you would be the developer, let's say it like that, how, based on what would you

691
00:49:09,719 --> 00:49:15,884
choose which is the best? Not, not like which person, you know, what, which, let's say you're a

692
00:49:15,884 --> 00:49:20,047
developer, you're seeing four different videos with different music, you're, yourself is not a

693
00:49:20,047 --> 00:49:22,328
musician, do you just go with your instinct? Do you...

694
00:49:23,866 --> 00:49:26,407
Well, that's the blessing and curse of music, isn't it?

695
00:49:26,407 --> 00:49:29,469
It all comes from a personal standpoint.

696
00:49:29,469 --> 00:49:30,809
Each person hears something.

697
00:49:30,809 --> 00:49:34,671
If it's like heavy metal with orchestra, that's going to

698
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:37,773
elicit one emotional response from one person and a

699
00:49:37,773 --> 00:49:40,314
completely different emotional response from another person,

700
00:49:40,314 --> 00:49:43,476
just based on their own musical experience.

701
00:49:43,476 --> 00:49:48,698
So it's completely different from person to person.

702
00:49:48,698 --> 00:49:48,898
So

703
00:49:49,685 --> 00:49:53,668
you think it's it should be chosen by the game designers uh...

704
00:49:53,668 --> 00:49:57,511
personal favorite at the end of the day or should he go like you know

705
00:49:57,511 --> 00:50:00,354
go to a composer and say like

706
00:50:00,354 --> 00:50:03,256
i don't know you you need to decide who makes the music here

707
00:50:03,657 --> 00:50:09,659
I think it depends, I mean if you're talking about an audio director, usually they'll be

708
00:50:09,659 --> 00:50:11,420
the ones probably making the decision or?

709
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:14,961
No, I'm more speaking about audio directors are musicians eventually, right?

710
00:50:14,961 --> 00:50:17,721
Like they usually, at least they know music really well.

711
00:50:17,721 --> 00:50:19,142
In theory, yeah.

712
00:50:19,142 --> 00:50:21,423
That's super interesting.

713
00:50:21,423 --> 00:50:21,823
Beautiful.

714
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:22,083
Hope.

715
00:50:23,163 --> 00:50:29,025
So, uh, no, I'm speaking, if you're not a musician at all, you're just an indie developer

716
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:35,848
or, you know, a company without an audio director, um, and because this happens, they're getting,

717
00:50:35,848 --> 00:50:40,289
uh, contacting musicians, right, um, they see a few, uh, versions of things and they

718
00:50:40,289 --> 00:50:41,890
need to decide which one they're going with.

719
00:50:42,757 --> 00:50:47,322
Yeah, well, in that case, if they're deciding probably without knowing themselves,

720
00:50:47,322 --> 00:50:49,824
they're probably going to look to references within, you know,

721
00:50:49,824 --> 00:50:51,707
the industry of games that are like that genre.

722
00:50:51,707 --> 00:50:53,689
They're going to be like, oh, I listened to this, I listened to this,

723
00:50:53,689 --> 00:50:57,673
I really like this soundtrack, I like how this music works here.

724
00:50:57,673 --> 00:51:00,016
Probably they'll do their research and they'll do it based on.

725
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:03,708
probably experiences they've already had.

726
00:51:03,708 --> 00:51:08,129
The shortfall of that is that they don't get to have that new experience.

727
00:51:08,129 --> 00:51:13,391
Like Jason was talking about, like, make it something that we've never heard before.

728
00:51:13,391 --> 00:51:18,772
They don't get that piece if they're doing it based on something they already know.

729
00:51:18,772 --> 00:51:22,993
Unless they're quite adventurous or they already have a relationship with a composer.

730
00:51:22,993 --> 00:51:26,654
If they have a relationship with a composer, they probably will trust that composer

731
00:51:26,654 --> 00:51:28,215
to come up with something unique.

732
00:51:28,215 --> 00:51:30,095
And that's a great situation, I have to say.

733
00:51:30,496 --> 00:51:37,659
That would be the best of both worlds for everybody, but of course it requires either a previous relationship between the audio director and the composer,

734
00:51:37,659 --> 00:51:46,183
or maybe the audio director knows of other titles that the composers worked on, and don't necessarily want the composer to do that title again,

735
00:51:46,183 --> 00:51:53,486
but they appreciated the aesthetic that the composer brought to that title, and said, hey, could you do something like that for our game?

736
00:51:53,486 --> 00:52:00,409
I mean, as the composer, and you're the composer and audio director, but I've never been able to hire myself, but I do appreciate...

737
00:52:00,549 --> 00:52:02,690
Oh no, no, no, that's not what I meant.

738
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:05,152
No, it's a great thing.

739
00:52:05,152 --> 00:52:11,295
I appreciate being able to have a big level of trust, because that's really what it comes down to.

740
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:15,297
What really opened my eyes when I was working on Tomb Raider with Alex Wellmer...

741
00:52:15,798 --> 00:52:20,103
He said that, biggest compliment I've ever gotten is he said that I made him look like

742
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:23,646
he knew what he was talking about when they had meetings and he was talking about the

743
00:52:23,646 --> 00:52:23,867
music.

744
00:52:23,867 --> 00:52:29,293
Because it is like, I mean, the audio director is like putting a lot of trust in the composer

745
00:52:29,293 --> 00:52:33,617
to basically make them look good and make them like, hey guys, look, I know what I'm

746
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:33,758
doing.

747
00:52:33,758 --> 00:52:36,781
I hired the right person and they're doing everything that we talked about and they're

748
00:52:36,781 --> 00:52:37,562
doing it really well.

749
00:52:38,062 --> 00:52:42,309
Because if it doesn't work out for whatever reason, if it's, you know, the music direction

750
00:52:42,309 --> 00:52:46,075
changes, the game changes, it kind of all comes back and falls onto the audio director's

751
00:52:46,075 --> 00:52:47,917
shoulders like, how come the music isn't working?

752
00:52:48,577 --> 00:52:53,958
And then you fall back to well maybe we should use some temp tracks and figure out something and like get you know

753
00:52:53,958 --> 00:52:56,779
This is like a Bioshock game and Gary Scheinman did Gary Bioshock

754
00:52:56,779 --> 00:53:00,600
Let's hire Gary and it falls to that would that would be an amazing choice

755
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:06,742
But it falls to like a safe creative choice because it's something that they've already done as opposed to Gary's an amazing composer

756
00:53:06,742 --> 00:53:10,423
He does all these different things. Let's hire Gary and see what he can come up with

757
00:53:10,483 --> 00:53:17,829
As opposed to trying to find someone to fit a mold that you've already predetermined.

758
00:53:17,829 --> 00:53:23,553
Like, get someone that you appreciate as an artist and let them help you build the mold.

759
00:53:23,553 --> 00:53:24,474
Trust the artist.

760
00:53:24,474 --> 00:53:25,295
Yeah.

761
00:53:25,295 --> 00:53:26,355
I agree with that.

762
00:53:26,355 --> 00:53:29,238
Trust your composers, developers.

763
00:53:29,238 --> 00:53:29,618
Yeah.

764
00:53:29,618 --> 00:53:31,279
Are you in here, developers?

765
00:53:31,279 --> 00:53:31,579
All right.

766
00:53:31,579 --> 00:53:32,380
Let's take questions from people here.

767
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,562
There's a microphone right up there.

768
00:53:34,562 --> 00:53:37,103
That's a very lonely microphone.

769
00:53:37,103 --> 00:53:38,264
Do you mind stepping up to it?

770
00:53:38,264 --> 00:53:39,625
Don't be shy.

771
00:53:39,625 --> 00:53:40,346
Don't be shy.

772
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:45,487
Hey, this is really fascinating, thank you.

773
00:53:45,487 --> 00:53:49,148
I would love some more general tips on adaptive music.

774
00:53:49,148 --> 00:53:51,449
I've been dabbling in it myself lately, and I find,

775
00:53:51,449 --> 00:53:53,169
I don't know if it's because I can't,

776
00:53:53,169 --> 00:53:55,029
I am too close to it.

777
00:53:55,029 --> 00:53:57,030
It never feels right to me.

778
00:53:57,030 --> 00:53:58,310
I mean, obviously, if you're writing music

779
00:53:58,310 --> 00:53:59,991
that's very bed-based, then it works better

780
00:53:59,991 --> 00:54:02,411
than if you're writing music that has some melodic elements

781
00:54:02,411 --> 00:54:05,012
or harmonic changes.

782
00:54:05,012 --> 00:54:06,172
So I guess like, you know,

783
00:54:06,172 --> 00:54:07,673
are there some general guidelines?

784
00:54:07,673 --> 00:54:10,273
Like, do you always try to have transitions locked

785
00:54:10,273 --> 00:54:12,074
to a beat or to a bar?

786
00:54:12,074 --> 00:54:12,754
Do you always...

787
00:54:13,214 --> 00:54:17,018
Yeah, and does that work even if there are interruptions to melodic material?

788
00:54:17,018 --> 00:54:18,160
Like, stuff like that.

789
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:22,945
Um, I can do a quick, so I, like if I'm doing a five minute piece of music, that's

790
00:54:22,945 --> 00:54:25,488
going to be all these different layers and stuff, most of the time I'll keep it

791
00:54:25,488 --> 00:54:26,389
all in the same key.

792
00:54:26,389 --> 00:54:29,893
So the whole thing's in D minor, which might sound amazingly boring, but that

793
00:54:29,893 --> 00:54:33,737
has already limited me to sort of the a thousand different versions of

794
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:34,818
things I could do in my head.

795
00:54:35,104 --> 00:54:39,167
everything's tempo locked, everything's in the same key, maybe there's some meter changes,

796
00:54:39,167 --> 00:54:43,289
but I've got to program that all into Wwise when I'm putting it in. But the idea is like

797
00:54:43,289 --> 00:54:48,953
simplicity, less is more. And lots of randomization, at least for me. And I mess with the meter

798
00:54:48,953 --> 00:54:53,435
and I also do the walk away test where I just hit play and I'll go and, you know, like grab

799
00:54:53,435 --> 00:54:56,557
a bite to eat. I'll let it play and kind of hear it in the background as I'm walking around

800
00:54:56,557 --> 00:54:57,458
and kind of try to...

801
00:54:58,698 --> 00:55:04,182
distance myself a little bit because you get sick of it. I mean you work on the same two minutes for a day, you hate it.

802
00:55:04,182 --> 00:55:08,925
And you have to be objective and try to then implement it as well. It's definitely tough.

803
00:55:08,925 --> 00:55:18,450
I agree with the lock in a key or related keys to different sections so that when you move from one thing to the next it makes sense.

804
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:24,434
And then I sometimes use custom queues but they're at very specific points.

805
00:55:24,434 --> 00:55:26,655
And I also lock in tempo early.

806
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:33,099
Because those types of things, when you do simplify, as Jason just said, to certain things that do not change,

807
00:55:33,099 --> 00:55:36,221
then you're going to make other things more easy in terms of...

808
00:55:36,221 --> 00:55:39,724
Transitions are the hardest part with adaptive music, right?

809
00:55:39,724 --> 00:55:42,445
You're branching off to something new, you don't know when it's going to happen.

810
00:55:42,445 --> 00:55:46,948
That's really interesting to think about, right?

811
00:55:46,948 --> 00:55:49,150
And compositionally interesting, too, I think.

812
00:55:49,409 --> 00:55:53,913
Quick follow-up, just what's the shortest loop you've ever composed as a section?

813
00:55:53,913 --> 00:55:57,696
Because I think if anything I go too long, so what's like the shortest?

814
00:55:57,696 --> 00:56:05,223
Oh yeah, well I could say in mobile, they don't let you go long because it's all about space, right?

815
00:56:05,223 --> 00:56:07,244
So, I don't know, I don't do anything. Music-wise?

816
00:56:07,244 --> 00:56:11,328
Yeah, like if it's an adaptive context, if you're exploration to battle, what's the shortest?

817
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:17,089
I did music for a game called Mark of Kree, which was one of the first sort of MIDI-based

818
00:56:17,089 --> 00:56:18,910
adaptive music things.

819
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:23,493
It was all a lot of percussion, so I had loops that were literally like a tenth of a second

820
00:56:23,493 --> 00:56:24,054
because it was just a...

821
00:56:24,054 --> 00:56:25,174
And I had it going...

822
00:56:25,174 --> 00:56:27,096
And it was that little tiny thing was looping.

823
00:56:27,096 --> 00:56:27,496
I had 15 seconds.

824
00:56:27,496 --> 00:56:31,539
But I very much agree with what you said.

825
00:56:31,539 --> 00:56:36,782
At least when I'm working with adaptive, I spend, I don't know if most of the time but

826
00:56:36,782 --> 00:56:39,744
a lot of time, you know, perfecting the transitions.

827
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:45,774
um this is for me kind of the the place where it's like uh yeah staying in the same key and and

828
00:56:45,774 --> 00:56:53,160
the tempo that's um usually the case in adaptive I think uh but when stuff change I want them to

829
00:56:53,160 --> 00:57:00,166
feel as natural as I can so I usually spend a lot of time uh on that so you know going with

830
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:06,611
stingers and uh things like that and. Cool thank you so much. Thank you. Uh you were talking

831
00:57:06,611 --> 00:57:08,032
earlier about how uh.

832
00:57:08,755 --> 00:57:12,157
the feeling of the music was trying to be condensed down into one word

833
00:57:12,157 --> 00:57:17,540
and I noticed that all of your takes had very different ideas of what that scene

834
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:21,563
seemed like. Some of them were empowering, others tense and dramatic,

835
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:24,924
others chaotic. Do you think that if the

836
00:57:24,924 --> 00:57:28,907
audio director or the narrative game designer came up and said, hey

837
00:57:28,907 --> 00:57:32,329
we want this scene to be empowering or chaotic or

838
00:57:32,329 --> 00:57:35,991
they had one of these ideas, would that have made your music more similar to

839
00:57:35,991 --> 00:57:36,391
each other

840
00:57:36,391 --> 00:57:38,432
or could it still have just been as varied?

841
00:57:38,793 --> 00:57:42,835
So I think A is, it's the one question I always ask a

842
00:57:42,835 --> 00:57:43,415
developer.

843
00:57:43,415 --> 00:57:45,837
Like this is, no matter how long we've been working

844
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:49,178
together, no matter anything, I always say that like, give me

845
00:57:49,178 --> 00:57:52,920
the one or two words that, you know, to dance it down to.

846
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,762
I think it really helps musically.

847
00:57:55,762 --> 00:57:58,323
And yeah, personally, I think it would make it a lot.

848
00:57:59,562 --> 00:58:03,003
closer like uh... the music right because

849
00:58:03,003 --> 00:58:06,304
you know uh... being like epic right it's

850
00:58:06,304 --> 00:58:10,345
uh... if if that's the feeling that you you want to do then

851
00:58:10,345 --> 00:58:14,647
we will probably go in the general same direction like it wouldn't be as

852
00:58:14,647 --> 00:58:20,069
different as as it is now the core difference for mostly uh... for i think

853
00:58:20,069 --> 00:58:21,629
good composers is when

854
00:58:21,629 --> 00:58:25,451
the bass is interpreted in a different way you know what i mean like uh...

855
00:58:25,451 --> 00:58:28,051
when you think like this this needs to be sad or

856
00:58:29,553 --> 00:58:33,935
know, lonely, which are two different things. And uh, yeah.

857
00:58:33,935 --> 00:58:35,936
Hi, thank you all. I was just curious if these videos would be

858
00:58:35,936 --> 00:58:41,998
available for download or educational kind of use.

859
00:58:41,998 --> 00:58:46,460
Yeah, they're supposed to be in the GDC vault.

860
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:48,001
In the vault? Awesome.

861
00:58:48,001 --> 00:58:49,062
I think so, I hope I'm not lying.

862
00:58:49,062 --> 00:58:49,682
Fastest answer ever.

863
00:58:49,682 --> 00:58:50,242
Yeah!

864
00:58:50,242 --> 00:58:51,423
Ha ha ha!

865
00:58:51,423 --> 00:58:51,563
Good!

866
00:58:52,807 --> 00:58:53,888
Hey, thank you guys very much.

867
00:58:53,888 --> 00:58:58,412
I have a question that's more about the collaborative process.

868
00:58:58,412 --> 00:59:01,935
So I know, Jason, you talked about, like, in the mix,

869
00:59:01,935 --> 00:59:04,838
you sometimes make the mix to sound.

870
00:59:04,838 --> 00:59:08,541
It can be tempting to make a mix that sounds full on its own

871
00:59:08,541 --> 00:59:11,424
without really knowing how the sound effects are going to play.

872
00:59:11,424 --> 00:59:14,467
And if it turns out that they don't,

873
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:16,328
they actually kind of clash at the end of the day.

874
00:59:17,625 --> 00:59:24,181
How do you usually go about remixing or iterating with the sound designer if it's a different person?

875
00:59:24,181 --> 00:59:25,585
Usually by the time...

876
00:59:26,759 --> 00:59:31,764
everything's kind of getting implemented and kind of finished, it's too late.

877
00:59:31,764 --> 00:59:37,189
So it's more the music mixer or the audio director's shoulders to

878
00:59:37,189 --> 00:59:40,792
kind of carve things out with EQ normally, just to kind of make things sit better.

879
00:59:40,792 --> 00:59:45,576
And again, it's probably pretty dramatic EQ, where if you listen to the music by itself,

880
00:59:45,576 --> 00:59:47,358
it's like, where are all the lower mids?

881
00:59:47,358 --> 00:59:48,879
Like, how come there's no bottom end?

882
00:59:48,879 --> 00:59:52,062
Well, that's for explosions and footsteps or whatever.

883
00:59:52,377 --> 00:59:56,419
It's better when it's a back and forth thing, but it's not always the case.

884
00:59:56,419 --> 00:59:57,559
Sometimes it's just impossible.

885
00:59:57,559 --> 01:00:00,561
There's multiple composers, multiple people doing sound effects,

886
01:00:00,561 --> 01:00:04,683
multiple levels going on at the same time, depending on the scope of the game.

887
01:00:04,683 --> 01:00:06,403
Gotcha. Cool. Thank you.

888
01:00:06,403 --> 01:00:07,964
I think we're out of time.

889
01:00:07,964 --> 01:00:10,945
Yeah. Oh, one minute.

890
01:00:10,945 --> 01:00:11,706
One more. One more.

891
01:00:11,706 --> 01:00:13,626
We're getting. Yeah, you're good.

892
01:00:15,343 --> 01:00:20,047
So I was just curious, it seemed like you scored these, and I think contextually because of the

893
01:00:20,047 --> 01:00:24,570
dragon it's probably implicit there's something important happening there, but how might you

894
01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:31,515
have scored this video differently if it was definitely just like one of those emergent

895
01:00:31,515 --> 01:00:36,119
moments where you're like in an open world and you just sort of run across these things,

896
01:00:36,119 --> 01:00:39,642
and it's entirely possible the player might go through almost exactly the same fight like

897
01:00:39,642 --> 01:00:40,542
five minutes from now?

898
01:00:41,575 --> 01:00:46,338
How might, because these seemed like, you know, a big moment.

899
01:00:46,338 --> 01:00:48,839
How might you keep that intensity up with the full

900
01:00:48,839 --> 01:00:51,401
knowledge that that exact same music might play again or

901
01:00:51,401 --> 01:00:53,462
something very similar to it might play again?

902
01:00:53,462 --> 01:00:56,163
I've done a lot of stuff like that where you're using a

903
01:00:56,163 --> 01:00:57,965
stinger to highlight the moment.

904
01:00:57,965 --> 01:01:00,246
And then when you're programming the music into the

905
01:01:00,246 --> 01:01:03,448
engine, you can, you know, duck the rest of the music.

906
01:01:03,448 --> 01:01:06,849
Or you could even have, if it was something that may happen

907
01:01:07,634 --> 01:01:15,620
at least more than once, like it's going to happen four or five times, I would have four or five different stingers that would randomly and not repeatedly play

908
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:23,767
and maybe duck the other music out or also trigger a second layer that had like a pad or like a little choir or something that kind of emphasized the moment.

909
01:01:23,767 --> 01:01:28,591
But it would only do it that one time and then it would trigger a different one a different time.

910
01:01:28,849 --> 01:01:32,993
just make sure it automatically varies.

911
01:01:32,993 --> 01:01:36,997
Right, and the gameplay is going to be...

912
01:01:36,997 --> 01:01:40,862
Yeah, repeating element that you know would be significant each time,

913
01:01:40,862 --> 01:01:43,084
then you can use that as a compositional element

914
01:01:43,084 --> 01:01:44,506
and a way to change your music.

915
01:01:44,506 --> 01:01:44,926
Thank you.

916
01:01:44,926 --> 01:01:45,467
Right, thank you very much.

917
01:01:45,467 --> 01:01:45,707
Yeah, thank you.

918
01:01:45,707 --> 01:01:45,887
Thank you.
