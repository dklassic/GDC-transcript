00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:18,312
Hello. Thank you for coming to my talk, Don't Make My Job Easy, Effectively Pitching to Publishers.

2
00:00:19,173 --> 00:00:24,736
As mentioned in my intro, my name is August Brown, and I want to chat a little bit today about pitching.

3
00:00:25,956 --> 00:00:33,500
So first things first, a little bit about me. I have been in the industry for about 12 years,

4
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,661
but the vast, vast, vast majority of that

5
00:00:36,913 --> 00:00:39,234
has been working in indie publishing.

6
00:00:40,175 --> 00:00:42,516
And most of that work has been in production,

7
00:00:42,616 --> 00:00:45,918
but through my very start in publishing up to today,

8
00:00:46,038 --> 00:00:48,119
I've been heavily involved in sourcing

9
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,081
and evaluating games and chatting with devs.

10
00:00:51,662 --> 00:00:52,622
And through that work,

11
00:00:53,383 --> 00:00:56,204
I have personally reviewed thousands and thousands

12
00:00:56,244 --> 00:00:59,226
of pitches and chatted with hundreds and hundreds of devs

13
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:02,368
about mobile games, PC games,

14
00:01:02,428 --> 00:01:04,109
basically any kind of game out there.

15
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:05,370
And my hope

16
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,493
is that using all that knowledge and knowing,

17
00:01:09,853 --> 00:01:12,055
most importantly, like what gets me jazzed

18
00:01:12,095 --> 00:01:14,797
and what gets me excited about pitches

19
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:17,560
can be useful information for you all.

20
00:01:18,936 --> 00:01:24,420
And in this talk, I want to kind of recontextualize a little bit how we talk about pitching.

21
00:01:25,101 --> 00:01:32,887
And that is in most blog posts and GDC talks and for Twitter threads and whatever,

22
00:01:33,407 --> 00:01:41,434
there's always this focus on content. You got to have your pitch deck, you got to have your budget,

23
00:01:41,474 --> 00:01:45,697
you got to have your et cetera, et cetera. And all that stuff is super important. Those pitching

24
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:48,079
materials, you won't get your game signed without them.

25
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:58,185
But I do think you will get your game rejected a lot of the time before those even come into play before anyone opens your budget they'll made a decision that they don't want to sign your game.

26
00:01:58,605 --> 00:02:06,929
So I want to focus a little bit more on how we present information, rather than getting into the nitty gritty of what information to include in a pitch.

27
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:13,916
And to do this, I want to look at the pitch kind of as a whole as a sales funnel.

28
00:02:14,236 --> 00:02:16,779
And if you don't know what that means, that's super cool.

29
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:18,421
We're going to chat about that in a couple of minutes.

30
00:02:19,262 --> 00:02:21,424
And finally, I want to share some real-life examples.

31
00:02:21,845 --> 00:02:23,566
I want to pull back the curtain a little bit.

32
00:02:24,267 --> 00:02:28,167
show you a couple of games that got pitched to Armour Game Studios that we ended up signing,

33
00:02:28,888 --> 00:02:33,869
kind of how they laid out information and most importantly I think is like what it looks like

34
00:02:33,929 --> 00:02:38,190
on the other side when a publisher gets excited about a game and how we react to good pitches.

35
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:45,111
So kind of taking a little step back, I want to talk about that conventional wisdom I mentioned

36
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:46,831
a little bit ago and that is,

37
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:52,903
all the posts and everything about pitching for the most part comes from publishers.

38
00:02:53,283 --> 00:02:58,606
And I know I'm super guilty of working for a publisher too, but I think it's super important

39
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:04,990
to realize that there are kind of inherent biases that come from that point of view when we talk

40
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:13,254
about pitches because the very natural thing for us to do is to give advice that makes our job easier.

41
00:03:13,714 --> 00:03:19,456
We have business intelligence suites or spreadsheets or something where when we get your pitch,

42
00:03:19,476 --> 00:03:20,796
we're going to plug in the budget.

43
00:03:20,816 --> 00:03:26,158
We're going to plug in where you're from for tax purposes, and we're going to plug in when

44
00:03:26,178 --> 00:03:26,718
you're going to launch.

45
00:03:26,758 --> 00:03:29,079
And all these things go into some spreadsheet or something.

46
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:35,081
And so a lot of the information that people get from publishers tends to be like, what

47
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:40,022
can you do to make my job as efficient as possible at plugging all this information

48
00:03:40,082 --> 00:03:40,122
in?

49
00:03:41,003 --> 00:03:43,505
and other, our other advi

50
00:03:43,545 --> 00:03:44,607
like, oh, it's really anno

51
00:03:44,627 --> 00:03:45,327
do this, I'm going to adv

52
00:03:45,347 --> 00:03:46,288
I want to steer a little

53
00:03:46,328 --> 00:03:47,109
because while that is a v

54
00:03:47,149 --> 00:03:48,330
to giving information and

55
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:59,263
you put together a fair like objective pitch,

56
00:04:00,064 --> 00:04:00,765
you shouldn't be fair.

57
00:04:01,085 --> 00:04:03,268
There are thousands of desk pitching games

58
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,871
and it's super competitive

59
00:04:04,971 --> 00:04:08,436
and anything you can do to get your pitch

60
00:04:08,536 --> 00:04:10,799
kind of resonating with a few more people,

61
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,021
you should try to do it.

62
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,723
So to talk about this, I want to conceptualize it through this lens of a sales funnel.

63
00:04:19,263 --> 00:04:25,147
And to get everyone up to speed on what maybe a sales funnel is or isn't, I want to play a little

64
00:04:25,468 --> 00:04:28,850
mind game for just a second and just pretend you no longer work in games.

65
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:34,093
And instead, you own a pet shop. And your goal in this pet shop is to sell puppies.

66
00:04:34,614 --> 00:04:40,438
And in order to sell puppies, there are a few steps you need everyone to go through first.

67
00:04:41,258 --> 00:04:42,719
First, someone needs to know your shop.

68
00:04:42,739 --> 00:04:44,259
If they don't know your pet shop exists,

69
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,400
they can't buy anything from you.

70
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,481
They need to enter your shop physically.

71
00:04:48,561 --> 00:04:50,061
They need to find a pet they want,

72
00:04:50,121 --> 00:04:52,502
and finally, they need to purchase it.

73
00:04:53,742 --> 00:04:54,943
If you look at this list,

74
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,184
there are a couple of really important things about it.

75
00:04:57,444 --> 00:05:00,525
One is every step is dependent on the steps above it.

76
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:04,546
No one can purchase a pet if they never walk in the front door.

77
00:05:04,946 --> 00:05:06,687
No one can find a pet that they really

78
00:05:06,747 --> 00:05:08,748
want if they don't know your shop exists.

79
00:05:09,448 --> 00:05:20,090
And at every step there are going to be a few people who like notice your shop and keep walking or someone who are like, oh, I really want this dog and then they see the price tag like, oh, I actually don't want this dog.

80
00:05:20,631 --> 00:05:36,855
And this is where we get to the sales funnel. So this is just kind of a visual representation of this phenomena where at every step, some number of people check out, and there isn't anyone else coming in outside of this like at step three they have to go through all the steps.

81
00:05:37,775 --> 00:05:52,627
And so to kind of conceptualize different ways that sales funnel might interact with different approaches, let's look at scenario A, where we have our pet shop and our approach is we're putting the biggest sign we can out there that says we're selling puppies for $7,500.

82
00:05:53,188 --> 00:06:01,155
And scenario B, where we have the same pet shop, but instead we put the biggest window out we can with the cutest puppy out in front.

83
00:06:02,015 --> 00:06:06,421
And this is where we get to the fact that not every sales funnel looks the same.

84
00:06:06,942 --> 00:06:11,628
Some approaches you're going to have just as many people knowing that your business exists,

85
00:06:11,668 --> 00:06:16,374
but then it's just going to shrink the hell up because I don't want to spend $7,000 on a puppy.

86
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:21,947
Conversely, you're going to have just as many people at the top know that your shop exists,

87
00:06:21,967 --> 00:06:25,730
but they're like, oh, that's a cute dog. I'm going to go see what that dog's business is

88
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:29,973
all about. And they walk in your door and your funnel's a lot bigger. And this will come back

89
00:06:30,033 --> 00:06:37,419
in a little bit. And all this is important because pitching, like everything in this

90
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:42,563
capitalist hellscape we're in, is some form of marketing. That's just a very, very specific form

91
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:47,527
of marketing, which is you are marketing yourselves and your potential game to publishers for funding.

92
00:06:48,582 --> 00:06:52,424
And in doing that, it kind of follows the same steps

93
00:06:52,484 --> 00:06:54,485
where the publisher will receive your pitch,

94
00:06:54,585 --> 00:06:57,006
to play your demo, to distribute the game

95
00:06:57,046 --> 00:06:58,607
to the team for evaluation.

96
00:06:58,647 --> 00:07:01,268
They might take a few meetings internally or with you

97
00:07:01,328 --> 00:07:04,030
as the dev to kind of see what your business is

98
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,070
and ask some questions.

99
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,111
They might run some projections on the game.

100
00:07:07,151 --> 00:07:09,032
And finally, they might send you a publishing offer.

101
00:07:10,182 --> 00:07:13,803
But it's actually incredibly more granular than that,

102
00:07:14,103 --> 00:07:16,625
even if you look at just that first step of receiving

103
00:07:16,665 --> 00:07:17,025
the pitch.

104
00:07:17,545 --> 00:07:20,546
And in this example, I'm talking about email pitches

105
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:22,587
where you might email a pitch back to a publisher.

106
00:07:24,008 --> 00:07:27,670
Just for simplicity, all of the examples will be assuming that.

107
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:30,951
But this applies to a meeting you might take,

108
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:34,032
or sending out a meeting invite, or anything in between.

109
00:07:35,113 --> 00:07:37,054
All of this logic still applies.

110
00:07:37,754 --> 00:07:43,576
So in receiving the pitch deck, the first thing they're going to do is look at the email subject

111
00:07:43,636 --> 00:07:47,897
and make some snap decision of what they think about that game's description in that subject.

112
00:07:48,357 --> 00:07:51,538
And then they're going to scan the email for visual elements, and then they might,

113
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:57,560
if they like what they see, click on a video and then scan to a random spot in that video and watch

114
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:01,461
for a few seconds to see if they like what they see. And they might look at some email text,

115
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:03,822
and then finally they might open your pitch deck.

116
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:06,971
and scan that to see if anything jumps out at them.

117
00:08:07,491 --> 00:08:09,612
And then if you go through a thousand more

118
00:08:09,632 --> 00:08:10,933
of these little micro steps,

119
00:08:11,453 --> 00:08:13,054
someday you might get a publishing offer.

120
00:08:13,775 --> 00:08:16,697
And so if this looks familiar, it's because it is.

121
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:19,078
It is the exact same thing as the pet shop.

122
00:08:19,138 --> 00:08:21,679
This is a sales funnel and all the same rules apply.

123
00:08:22,523 --> 00:08:29,805
you can't get someone to open your pitch deck if they archive the email at looking at your gifts,

124
00:08:29,865 --> 00:08:36,586
which sucks. It happens. I think a lot of publishers try to give every game their fair shake,

125
00:08:37,346 --> 00:08:42,027
and even if they don't archive your email, they might have made this internal decision of like,

126
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,948
oh, this game's not for me, and they might go on to open your pitch deck,

127
00:08:44,968 --> 00:08:47,468
but essentially the game is already rejected at that point.

128
00:08:48,318 --> 00:08:52,321
And there's no one who's going to jump in at step five. They have to get through all first

129
00:08:52,441 --> 00:08:59,405
five steps before they get on to the later ones. And I think it's important to take one little

130
00:08:59,425 --> 00:09:04,249
step back at this point and just talk about some unfortunate truths on just the fact of the matter

131
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:08,892
of what happens with publishers and how we evaluate games. And that is we get so many

132
00:09:08,932 --> 00:09:11,734
pitches. We get thousands and thousands and thousands of pitches.

133
00:09:12,534 --> 00:09:18,719
And we can't afford to spend hours and hours looking at every single pitch.

134
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:24,624
And what that means, and this sinks, most demos don't get downloaded, let alone played.

135
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:29,948
Decision will be made before we even look at the demo like, oh, this game isn't for us, we can pass on it.

136
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:32,651
And even beyond that.

137
00:09:33,564 --> 00:09:36,846
a lot of decisions will be made whether or not we look at your pitch deck later.

138
00:09:37,867 --> 00:09:41,309
Even before we open that pitch deck, we'll either be excited about your game or like,

139
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:47,373
this is probably a pass. And we might look through the pitch deck to see if there's anything in there

140
00:09:47,413 --> 00:09:50,455
that might change our minds. But a lot of decisions have been made by that point.

141
00:09:51,155 --> 00:09:55,278
And even if someone does watch a video, if you send a like 20 minute gameplay video,

142
00:09:56,678 --> 00:10:01,021
I guarantee you almost no one is watching that. If you send a five hour gameplay video,

143
00:10:01,061 --> 00:10:02,462
which we totally receive.

144
00:10:03,327 --> 00:10:06,409
I guarantee you 0% of publishers watch those five hours.

145
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:13,132
And so you get 10 to 30 seconds of whatever you send that the publisher is going to realistically

146
00:10:13,192 --> 00:10:17,694
watch. And those will be a random 10 to 30 seconds wherever they happen to scrub

147
00:10:17,714 --> 00:10:19,015
through in the timeline on that video.

148
00:10:20,015 --> 00:10:22,356
And this all just sucks.

149
00:10:22,876 --> 00:10:25,417
It takes so much work to put together a pitch deck.

150
00:10:25,477 --> 00:10:28,498
It takes so much work to put together a demo that's

151
00:10:28,558 --> 00:10:29,698
ready to show to people.

152
00:10:30,038 --> 00:10:32,379
It takes so much time to capture video and edit it.

153
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:36,200
And you don't get fairly rewarded with people's time

154
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,120
for doing all that work.

155
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,500
And that just sucks.

156
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,844
But if we were to watch every five-hour gameplay video or even every five-minute gameplay video

157
00:10:45,864 --> 00:10:49,605
sent to us, that is literally all we would be doing and we couldn't effectively run a

158
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:55,568
publishing business. So while I admit this really sucks and it's not fair, it is just how things are.

159
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,830
And so I think we can go into this with that knowledge in mind

160
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,811
and kind of make some smart decisions on how we structure pitches.

161
00:11:03,132 --> 00:11:05,994
And to do that, I think we have to talk about how decisions get made.

162
00:11:06,054 --> 00:11:10,016
And this isn't talking about like how groups come together to form consensus.

163
00:11:10,056 --> 00:11:11,958
This is just on a personal level.

164
00:11:12,498 --> 00:11:14,299
Like, do I get excited about something?

165
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:16,720
Do I think something's a good idea or a bad idea?

166
00:11:17,181 --> 00:11:19,682
Because at the end of the day, computers.

167
00:11:23,745 --> 00:11:25,846
At least for now, don't process pitches.

168
00:11:26,657 --> 00:11:30,701
Humans process pitches and humans have feelings and can be manipulated.

169
00:11:31,101 --> 00:11:34,143
And I think that's super important to think about when we structure our pitches.

170
00:11:34,644 --> 00:11:39,468
And to put context of this, I like to think about our thinky brains and our feely brains,

171
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:42,830
kind of these two different modes you might be in when you're making decisions.

172
00:11:43,711 --> 00:11:43,871
And

173
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,621
it's important to know th

174
00:11:48,861 --> 00:11:50,982
context, only one of thes

175
00:11:51,322 --> 00:11:53,843
of your brain is really i

176
00:11:53,883 --> 00:11:55,644
at a given time. If you a

177
00:11:56,585 --> 00:11:59,146
analytical, logical mode

178
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,966
the numbers and like impa

179
00:12:01,967 --> 00:12:03,287
are in thinking brain mod

180
00:12:03,907 --> 00:12:05,108
is sitting in the passeng

181
00:12:07,297 --> 00:12:10,161
And feeling brain conversely is a more emotional state

182
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:12,183
that we might be in when we're making decisions.

183
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,066
So to kind of talk about these different states,

184
00:12:15,687 --> 00:12:17,049
let's first talk about thinky brain.

185
00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:21,313
If I am in thinky brain mode and I receive a pitch

186
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,616
and I am going through and evaluating it,

187
00:12:24,497 --> 00:12:26,358
My thinky brain is gonna be thinking about,

188
00:12:26,938 --> 00:12:29,019
what is the potential audience size for this game?

189
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:31,080
Does this game team have the experience

190
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,441
needed to execute on it?

191
00:12:32,781 --> 00:12:33,982
What are the marketing challenges?

192
00:12:34,002 --> 00:12:37,103
Like, does the art look really like it would skew

193
00:12:37,163 --> 00:12:38,184
to younger audiences,

194
00:12:38,244 --> 00:12:40,545
but the game itself has some really heavy themes?

195
00:12:40,645 --> 00:12:42,066
Is that gonna make a marketing heart?

196
00:12:42,646 --> 00:12:44,287
Does the game fit within our budget

197
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,548
and does it fit within our launch calendar?

198
00:12:46,768 --> 00:12:50,090
And are there other games launching in the same time period

199
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,772
that might pose kind of external risks to this game?

200
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:55,534
And if you, uh...

201
00:12:57,229 --> 00:12:58,650
think about it as I go through this,

202
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:02,673
these are all very like logical approaches

203
00:13:02,713 --> 00:13:04,555
to thinking about like what is the risk

204
00:13:04,595 --> 00:13:06,136
versus reward on these things.

205
00:13:07,257 --> 00:13:09,178
Conversely, feely brain,

206
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,680
feely brain just wants to have a good time.

207
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:15,383
Feely brain is only out there to get jazzed about stuff

208
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:18,005
or repulse, but we're mostly gonna be talking

209
00:13:18,025 --> 00:13:19,486
about being jazzed about stuff

210
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:23,109
and really just doesn't care about anything else

211
00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:25,351
other than like, hell yeah, this game rules.

212
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:26,471
So.

213
00:13:27,203 --> 00:13:29,624
Thinking about the pet shop example earlier,

214
00:13:30,524 --> 00:13:33,725
if your thinky brain is in the driver's seat,

215
00:13:34,786 --> 00:13:37,627
typically speaking, that funnel is just gonna be

216
00:13:37,647 --> 00:13:39,948
a lot more narrow because our thinky brain

217
00:13:39,988 --> 00:13:43,129
is gonna be able to like, ah, that budget's a little high.

218
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:44,590
I don't think it's a fit.

219
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,770
Oh man, there are like two other games

220
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,651
that are kind of similar.

221
00:13:48,488 --> 00:13:50,229
I don't think this one's a good match.

222
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:52,530
And it's very easy for thinki-brain

223
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,951
to disqualify a game.

224
00:13:54,491 --> 00:13:57,632
Conversely, feeli-brain just gets excited.

225
00:13:57,693 --> 00:14:00,294
And it's easy for feeli-brain kind of at that point

226
00:14:00,334 --> 00:14:04,876
to let kind of your heart lead the decision-making process.

227
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,037
And like, oh, man, budget's a little high.

228
00:14:07,177 --> 00:14:07,777
Doesn't matter.

229
00:14:07,857 --> 00:14:08,657
This game rules.

230
00:14:08,737 --> 00:14:09,578
I want to work on it.

231
00:14:10,738 --> 00:14:10,958
So.

232
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:16,774
From those examples, you see, like, I feel very strongly that everything your pitch should be

233
00:14:16,954 --> 00:14:21,275
optimized so that feely brain can just do its thing and get jazzed about your game.

234
00:14:22,235 --> 00:14:28,357
And this starts from the very beginning of having an evocative email subject. We get so many pitches

235
00:14:29,037 --> 00:14:36,639
that just are like, oh, pitch for Armor Game Studios or new game for pitching. And it's

236
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:40,140
accurate, but like, that's not going to get me jazzed. And.

237
00:14:40,939 --> 00:14:44,080
An email subject will never be the end of it.

238
00:14:44,121 --> 00:14:45,981
You'll never get your game effectively signed

239
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:46,582
from the subject.

240
00:14:46,942 --> 00:14:49,863
But what it does do is it puts my brain

241
00:14:50,003 --> 00:14:51,784
into kind of this curious mode.

242
00:14:51,844 --> 00:14:53,945
If there's like, ooh, I don't know what that means,

243
00:14:54,325 --> 00:14:55,185
I want to know more.

244
00:14:55,706 --> 00:14:59,527
It kind of primes the pump for my feely brain to take over.

245
00:14:59,727 --> 00:15:02,709
Right from the get-go, putting the absolute best gifts

246
00:15:02,749 --> 00:15:05,030
you can right at the top of this email,

247
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:05,550
or your...

248
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:12,088
presentation if you're giving it live or whatever, just like hit them hard out of the gate.

249
00:15:12,448 --> 00:15:18,890
There is no merit in burying the lead. The best looking thing you can do and put out there, put

250
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:24,611
it right at the top. And very short descriptions that get right at your unique selling point.

251
00:15:24,771 --> 00:15:28,872
What makes your game unique in one or two sentences? A very important thing to know

252
00:15:28,892 --> 00:15:34,193
about Feeling Brain is it doesn't like to read. And so if you throw too many words at it,

253
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:36,954
it's going to check out and Thinking Brain is going to take over.

254
00:15:37,975 --> 00:15:42,922
And this applies to kind of burying links to important things because

255
00:15:42,963 --> 00:15:44,805
feely brain still wants to check out your demo.

256
00:15:45,005 --> 00:15:47,289
It still wants to check out your video, but

257
00:15:48,172 --> 00:15:52,054
it needs to be able to find it. So if you have those links just like buried in a paragraph,

258
00:15:52,434 --> 00:15:56,276
it's going to be kind of easy to check out. But if you just have it like super clear cut,

259
00:15:56,316 --> 00:16:01,038
like this is where the video is, Feely Brain can keep doing its thing. And that's really it.

260
00:16:01,498 --> 00:16:06,160
There are like obviously a ton of little bits of nuance to this, but at the end of the day,

261
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,783
just put the raddest shit at top and everything else will kind of go from there. And so

262
00:16:12,915 --> 00:16:14,057
kind of as I mentioned be

263
00:16:14,077 --> 00:16:15,058
way or reason why I think

264
00:16:15,138 --> 00:16:16,400
about it this way is that

265
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:28,573
your deck and your demo and all your other materials don't have to do as much heavy lifting.

266
00:16:29,073 --> 00:16:32,356
If think you bring were at the wheel, they would have to do all the lifting of like, yep,

267
00:16:32,376 --> 00:16:36,899
this budget makes monetary sense. And this is a reasonable timeline for this game to be executed

268
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:42,744
on. But there's just a little more grace when you're feeling brain is driving. And finally,

269
00:16:42,924 --> 00:16:45,746
and I think this is so important is your pitch.

270
00:16:46,467 --> 00:16:49,228
The goal shouldn't be to get your game signed

271
00:16:49,268 --> 00:16:51,389
because that doesn't happen.

272
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,811
No one just like sees a pitch and like sends you a check.

273
00:16:55,311 --> 00:16:58,473
What happens is we need to go through

274
00:16:58,553 --> 00:17:01,295
like different negotiations and different whatever.

275
00:17:01,415 --> 00:17:02,595
And like it's way down the line.

276
00:17:03,076 --> 00:17:05,517
What your pitch should do is get one person

277
00:17:06,517 --> 00:17:09,179
at the publisher, super jazzed about your game

278
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:12,080
and want to champion it and be excited about it.

279
00:17:13,563 --> 00:17:18,125
And so as I mentioned at the top, to kind of look over how this happens,

280
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,467
we're going to look at a couple of case studies of real games

281
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:24,548
that Armor Game Studios signed, how they organize their pitches

282
00:17:24,948 --> 00:17:28,110
and a little bit of reactions from our private Slack.

283
00:17:29,244 --> 00:17:31,745
So the first game I want to chat about is the charter ski.

284
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:34,406
It's a super rad game coming out later this summer.

285
00:17:35,427 --> 00:17:36,507
Jumping right out of the gates.

286
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:41,430
Its email subject was nothing that is going to set the world on fire,

287
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,770
admittedly, but it did.

288
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,011
It wasn't.

289
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:45,932
This is a pitch for our game studios.

290
00:17:46,192 --> 00:17:47,212
And there was a vocative.

291
00:17:48,012 --> 00:17:50,233
I don't know what a horror mystery game really means.

292
00:17:50,473 --> 00:17:51,633
That sounds kind of interesting.

293
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:53,233
PS1 style?

294
00:17:53,854 --> 00:17:55,574
I've seen some games that kind of do that,

295
00:17:55,614 --> 00:17:56,834
but that sounds kind of neat.

296
00:17:56,894 --> 00:17:57,674
I'll check this out.

297
00:17:57,774 --> 00:17:59,995
It puts me in that curious mode.

298
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:03,916
And then the body has this really short

299
00:18:03,936 --> 00:18:05,856
and sweet literal description about the game.

300
00:18:06,296 --> 00:18:08,117
And then they just hit us with this gif,

301
00:18:08,197 --> 00:18:11,098
which is this room that's beautifully rendered

302
00:18:11,118 --> 00:18:14,918
in this PS1 style with all these demonic runes everywhere

303
00:18:15,318 --> 00:18:17,519
and blood splattered on the walls and floor.

304
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:20,542
and the main character talking about how fucked up it is.

305
00:18:21,402 --> 00:18:23,684
And we'll chat about this in a second,

306
00:18:23,704 --> 00:18:25,266
but it just came out of the gates like,

307
00:18:25,346 --> 00:18:27,608
this is the game's identity and this is what we're about.

308
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:31,812
And secondly, just as I mentioned previously,

309
00:18:32,172 --> 00:18:33,734
it just really clearly laid out like,

310
00:18:33,774 --> 00:18:35,495
hey, you wanna check out the video

311
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:36,937
or you wanna check out the vertical slice,

312
00:18:37,057 --> 00:18:37,918
here's a couple of links

313
00:18:37,938 --> 00:18:39,399
so you don't have to worry about too much reading.

314
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:45,201
So at 1137 AM the day we received this email,

315
00:18:45,701 --> 00:18:46,622
we got the email in,

316
00:18:47,122 --> 00:18:48,343
within the same minute,

317
00:18:49,043 --> 00:18:51,685
I pop into Slack in our eval channel and say,

318
00:18:51,725 --> 00:18:54,046
hey, this game looks kind of interesting,

319
00:18:54,086 --> 00:18:55,287
but it's not really my jam.

320
00:18:55,347 --> 00:18:56,908
And I don't think it'll really be our jam,

321
00:18:56,948 --> 00:18:57,768
but it looks kind of neat.

322
00:18:58,268 --> 00:19:00,550
And immediately our director of games, Dora,

323
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:03,691
jumps in with yo and capital yo's

324
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,393
and just the excitement instantly goes from there.

325
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:10,221
and jump forward 25 minutes.

326
00:19:10,502 --> 00:19:11,823
She's spamming all caps.

327
00:19:11,883 --> 00:19:13,464
She's talking about how great the demo is.

328
00:19:13,584 --> 00:19:15,185
The demo takes 20 minutes to play.

329
00:19:15,665 --> 00:19:18,447
This happened 25 minutes after we received the email.

330
00:19:18,467 --> 00:19:20,149
We had already played through the demo.

331
00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:24,232
And my attitude towards the game went from like,

332
00:19:24,352 --> 00:19:26,313
I'm not so sure about this, to being like, man,

333
00:19:26,393 --> 00:19:27,474
I want to get on this train.

334
00:19:27,814 --> 00:19:28,655
Dora's excited.

335
00:19:28,715 --> 00:19:29,736
Now I'm excited.

336
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:36,060
And so things that the Charters Key did really well is it knew who it was and it knew that it

337
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:41,885
didn't have to hit with anyone. They could have just showed like a kind of generic hallway in

338
00:19:41,925 --> 00:19:46,328
that graphic style and not worried about like all the blood and cursing, but like that's what the

339
00:19:46,368 --> 00:19:50,371
game is. And so they would have seen that eventually if they played the demo anyway,

340
00:19:50,411 --> 00:19:52,052
so they just hit us with that out of the game.

341
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:56,511
They front loaded all the really good feely brain stuff,

342
00:19:56,711 --> 00:19:59,253
like the GIF and everything,

343
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,834
so that we didn't have to worry about thinking about budget

344
00:20:01,874 --> 00:20:03,635
before we got excited about the game.

345
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:08,418
And then kind of harking back to before,

346
00:20:08,438 --> 00:20:09,659
it just takes big swings.

347
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,240
It knows what the game's identity is,

348
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,701
and it knows that somewhere out there

349
00:20:12,721 --> 00:20:14,442
will resonate with it, which it did.

350
00:20:15,702 --> 00:20:17,483
And secondly, we're going to chat a little bit

351
00:20:17,604 --> 00:20:19,365
about a game called Islands.

352
00:20:19,979 --> 00:20:21,841
First off, here are a couple of quotes

353
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:22,822
I'd like to share with you.

354
00:20:23,703 --> 00:20:27,167
First, metroidvanias are always gonna be a saturated market.

355
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:29,991
It feels like every metroidvania

356
00:20:30,011 --> 00:20:31,913
is gonna be facing an uphill climb right now,

357
00:20:31,973 --> 00:20:34,155
and I'm not sure what separates this one from the pack.

358
00:20:34,976 --> 00:20:36,338
This is a very competent game,

359
00:20:36,378 --> 00:20:38,360
but I have no idea what would make me excited

360
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,421
to sign a metroidvania.

361
00:20:40,174 --> 00:20:41,355
These are all quotes by me.

362
00:20:41,395 --> 00:20:44,998
These are all real things I said that are forever enshrined in our

363
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,423
kind of spreadsheet type stuff of where we chat about games that we're evaluating.

364
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,225
And these are all real opinions I had.

365
00:20:53,506 --> 00:20:55,727
I was, I love Metroidvanias.

366
00:20:55,928 --> 00:20:59,631
I play them all the time on my own time, but they're, it's kind of hard market.

367
00:20:59,831 --> 00:21:02,093
And I didn't know what would make me excited about it.

368
00:21:02,253 --> 00:21:03,854
And time after time again, I'm like,

369
00:21:04,074 --> 00:21:05,936
I'll just never fall in love with a Metroidvania.

370
00:21:06,036 --> 00:21:06,497
That's fine.

371
00:21:07,097 --> 00:21:08,418
And then came Islands.

372
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:11,978
Uh, right from the beginning, the email subject.

373
00:21:12,378 --> 00:21:15,501
Again, we're not running for a checkbook after seeing this, but

374
00:21:17,122 --> 00:21:19,345
uh, what does surprisingly wholesome mean?

375
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:22,187
That's kind of weird. I want to know more about that.

376
00:21:22,828 --> 00:21:24,469
Metroidvania, okay, I get that.

377
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,592
I'm like, what's a puzzle piece map?

378
00:21:28,173 --> 00:21:30,535
How does a puzzle piece map work in a Metroidvania?

379
00:21:31,035 --> 00:21:35,640
Again, I'm not going to sign the game right now, but I am curious as hell.

380
00:21:36,456 --> 00:21:39,281
and then ignoring text or anything else.

381
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:44,148
the game jumps right or sorry,

382
00:21:44,188 --> 00:21:45,609
the email jumped right out of the gates

383
00:21:45,649 --> 00:21:48,411
with just two absolutely gorgeous gifts of this game

384
00:21:48,451 --> 00:21:51,614
in this hand painted kind of Studio Ghibli style

385
00:21:52,294 --> 00:21:54,636
with these super cute evocative characters

386
00:21:54,716 --> 00:21:56,598
jumping around this bright colorful world.

387
00:21:57,058 --> 00:21:59,460
And it took me five seconds to open this email

388
00:21:59,821 --> 00:22:02,203
and see these gifts and be like, fuck yes, I love this.

389
00:22:02,483 --> 00:22:03,484
I wanna love this game.

390
00:22:04,304 --> 00:22:07,247
And then as I mentioned, like everything else was just like,

391
00:22:07,687 --> 00:22:09,589
here's a cute little quote about the game.

392
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,503
And here's like really straightforward links if you want to know more.

393
00:22:14,363 --> 00:22:17,686
So for this one at 1023, we received the email from the developer.

394
00:22:17,887 --> 00:22:21,310
In the next minute, I am chatting a lot about this game

395
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,572
and talking about how gorgeous and wonderful it looks.

396
00:22:24,318 --> 00:22:29,163
One minute later, people are trying to change the topic to some other games that we're evaluating,

397
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:32,727
and I won't let them, because all I want to do is talk about eyelets.

398
00:22:33,849 --> 00:22:40,216
And 15 minutes later, we have the eyelets emoji in Armor Games Slack, and I will spam that emoji

399
00:22:40,256 --> 00:22:45,021
to my co-workers consistently over the next week until they all agree to sign this game.

400
00:22:47,139 --> 00:22:49,420
And so that's what building a champion looks like.

401
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:53,423
And I had not looked through the pitch deck all that much

402
00:22:53,463 --> 00:22:53,983
at that point.

403
00:22:54,184 --> 00:22:55,945
I already knew I loved this game,

404
00:22:56,025 --> 00:22:57,146
and I was going to fight for it.

405
00:22:58,267 --> 00:23:01,489
And so what did Islets do well?

406
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,572
It has absolutely gorgeous art.

407
00:23:05,912 --> 00:23:06,132
Sorry.

408
00:23:08,734 --> 00:23:11,096
And I knew it, and it put it right up front in the email.

409
00:23:12,247 --> 00:23:17,729
It had that really evocative subject line that kind of hinted at little interesting questions

410
00:23:17,769 --> 00:23:24,671
that I just wanted to be curious about. It had a 60 second trailer and every second of that trailer

411
00:23:24,711 --> 00:23:29,453
was magic. There was no point where I could jump to and like, oh this looks a little boring or

412
00:23:29,493 --> 00:23:34,435
something. No matter where I randomly scroll to in that trailer, that game looked rad as hell.

413
00:23:35,437 --> 00:23:36,798
And it didn't try to do too much.

414
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:39,922
It included the budget.

415
00:23:40,062 --> 00:23:43,086
It included the demo, which ruled,

416
00:23:43,426 --> 00:23:44,908
and included all these things that

417
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:48,052
are necessary for us to eventually make our decision.

418
00:23:49,213 --> 00:23:50,615
But it didn't front load those.

419
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:56,359
And honestly, if it didn't include a budget, there is no reality where I would have gotten

420
00:23:56,379 --> 00:23:59,882
this excited and be like, oh, you didn't include a budget. I guess we're not going to sign this one.

421
00:24:00,042 --> 00:24:03,324
I would have just emailed the dev immediately and demanded that budget

422
00:24:03,704 --> 00:24:05,465
because I wanted to work on this game.

423
00:24:06,729 --> 00:24:09,551
And enthusiasm is infectious.

424
00:24:09,571 --> 00:24:11,313
And this is why it's all so important,

425
00:24:11,773 --> 00:24:14,375
is I got so jazzed about this game,

426
00:24:14,655 --> 00:24:18,078
and it took a very small amount of time for my co-workers

427
00:24:18,118 --> 00:24:21,580
to similarly start spamming our eyelids emojis whenever

428
00:24:21,621 --> 00:24:22,741
we're talking about games.

429
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:25,223
And it just spread, and then we eventually signed the game.

430
00:24:26,444 --> 00:24:30,047
And so in conclusion, a couple of things

431
00:24:30,087 --> 00:24:33,570
I want to wrap up with is front load your pitch.

432
00:24:34,254 --> 00:24:35,654
Don't try to bury the lead.

433
00:24:35,714 --> 00:24:36,775
Don't try to be cute.

434
00:24:36,855 --> 00:24:38,996
Don't try to be like, ah, this is the final enemy.

435
00:24:39,056 --> 00:24:39,977
I don't want to reveal it.

436
00:24:40,097 --> 00:24:41,598
If that's the coolest thing in your game,

437
00:24:41,658 --> 00:24:42,678
show it right out of the gates.

438
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:46,341
And this doesn't apply just to pitching to publishers.

439
00:24:46,381 --> 00:24:49,743
This certainly doesn't apply just to email pitches.

440
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,704
This is if you're looking for grants,

441
00:24:51,884 --> 00:24:54,685
if you're pitching to different funds,

442
00:24:54,966 --> 00:24:57,947
if you're looking to build a Steam page,

443
00:24:58,708 --> 00:25:01,570
any kind of marketing, I think this logic all applies.

444
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:03,971
Don't go too broad.

445
00:25:04,011 --> 00:25:07,133
Don't say like, oh, I think this aspect of the game,

446
00:25:07,193 --> 00:25:08,774
even though it's core to its identity,

447
00:25:08,834 --> 00:25:10,975
might turn off some people, so we're gonna play it safe.

448
00:25:12,216 --> 00:25:13,637
That might be how you get through

449
00:25:13,677 --> 00:25:15,037
thinky brain a little further,

450
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,438
but that's not how you're gonna hook

451
00:25:16,778 --> 00:25:17,999
feely brains with people.

452
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:19,480
You're gonna build your champions

453
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,221
by putting what your game is out there,

454
00:25:21,361 --> 00:25:23,523
owning it, and hoping you find like-minded people.

455
00:25:24,703 --> 00:25:26,524
And most publishers won't have your champion,

456
00:25:26,724 --> 00:25:29,386
and that's fine, and that's just the reality of it.

457
00:25:29,466 --> 00:25:32,148
There are hundreds and hundreds of publishers out there.

458
00:25:33,197 --> 00:25:36,098
And chances are, if your game actually like,

459
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,620
you have kind of that heart in it and you put it out there,

460
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,780
there's a good chance there's someone at some publishers

461
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,501
just waiting to be your champion.

462
00:25:47,701 --> 00:25:50,162
And when you think you have your pitch done,

463
00:25:50,562 --> 00:25:52,642
go through point by point and say like,

464
00:25:52,722 --> 00:25:55,103
nope, I don't need this sentence to be this long.

465
00:25:55,183 --> 00:25:56,804
I don't need this thing to be this long.

466
00:25:57,204 --> 00:25:58,844
Feely brain isn't gonna like that.

467
00:25:59,294 --> 00:26:02,996
and put the stuff up a higher like no, this gives a little juicier.

468
00:26:03,036 --> 00:26:05,498
We're going to put that up and we're going to put all these things below.

469
00:26:05,978 --> 00:26:08,400
And whatever you can do just to make sure that feel

470
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,601
your brain can take the steering wheel from the get go.

471
00:26:11,762 --> 00:26:13,082
And that's it. Thank you so much.

472
00:26:29,075 --> 00:26:39,644
Hello. I really, really love this talk. A lot of the things you were mentioning was how important it is to get publishers even like into a state of like fast thinking rather than slow thinking.

473
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:39,924
Yeah.

474
00:26:40,685 --> 00:26:56,338
Is there any, you know, is there any further reading that one could do to like start, you know, just learning sales or what anything you'd recommend to just, you know, be able to get a better salesman, I guess, is the main thing about this.

475
00:26:56,358 --> 00:26:57,139
Yeah, I think

476
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:07,114
Nothing is jumping to mind too much for me. I don't know. I like paradox of choice kind of

477
00:27:07,154 --> 00:27:11,016
gets into this is talking about like how people make decisions and how people make choices.

478
00:27:11,276 --> 00:27:14,558
And that's been kind of fundamental in how I think about this stuff. But besides that,

479
00:27:15,778 --> 00:27:17,759
I think you can just search out like.

480
00:27:18,859 --> 00:27:23,528
marketing more generally rather than searching out specifically information on pitching.

481
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:28,479
Just any information out there and talks on marketing will apply to pitching correctly.

482
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:29,821
Thank you very much.

483
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:44,166
Hi, thanks so much for this talk. I think I speak for everyone when I say that it's just amazing to hear the other side of the table, to understand how these conversations can happen when you send something out there in the dark.

484
00:27:45,546 --> 00:27:57,953
I was curious, actually, two questions. I'll try to make them brief. Question one, do you think that the way of thinking about this diverges greatly from an indie publisher to a larger publisher? And question number two,

485
00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:03,010
if there's a developer out there looking for somewhat of a larger budget, have you seen more

486
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:08,732
kind of indie publishers carrying a title up to a certain level that then gets taken up by a larger

487
00:28:08,772 --> 00:28:15,214
publisher? How do you think about that? So for your first question, I haven't worked at a AAA

488
00:28:15,234 --> 00:28:22,056
publisher, so I can't tell you, but this applies. And there have been a lot of really good talks

489
00:28:23,496 --> 00:28:27,477
from other folks. Nick, I'm blanking on his last name right now.

490
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:34,753
think from Xbox or something gave a talk a few years ago about finding champions and whatnot. And so whether you're pitching to

491
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:43,415
like a small publisher or a large publisher or you're pitching to Nintendo trying to get some co-marketing or Xbox or

492
00:28:43,456 --> 00:28:50,598
whatever it is at the end of the day we're all humans and you're going to get people excited by finding those champions and

493
00:28:50,638 --> 00:28:55,820
kind of hitting those emotional points. So I think it applies to basically anyone you're pitching anything to.

494
00:28:57,633 --> 00:29:00,375
And for your second question, I don't think I totally follow.

495
00:29:01,196 --> 00:29:03,518
I think typically, co-publishing in general

496
00:29:03,538 --> 00:29:06,541
still is fairly rare, if that's what you're describing.

497
00:29:06,701 --> 00:29:07,362
Yeah.

498
00:29:07,522 --> 00:29:07,782
Yeah.

499
00:29:09,663 --> 00:29:12,366
Often, there will be other funds or other things

500
00:29:12,446 --> 00:29:16,069
that a publisher might be up to working.

501
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:17,090
I know like with.

502
00:29:18,474 --> 00:29:22,897
you know, Canon Media Fund and like lots of other government funds.

503
00:29:23,837 --> 00:29:27,420
But with other publishers, it just gets pretty muddy and I don't think it's super common.

504
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,241
I'll ask you about it on LinkedIn sometime.

505
00:29:29,281 --> 00:29:29,721
Thanks so much.

506
00:29:29,741 --> 00:29:30,241
Sounds great.

507
00:29:31,626 --> 00:29:33,547
Hi, thank you very much for the talk.

508
00:29:33,627 --> 00:29:34,688
It was very informative.

509
00:29:34,808 --> 00:29:37,049
And you're absolutely right about everything you said,

510
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:39,871
that time is limited and so on, right?

511
00:29:40,251 --> 00:29:42,912
But have you guys considered actually

512
00:29:42,952 --> 00:29:45,114
like the other side of the coin?

513
00:29:45,314 --> 00:29:48,916
And while we, as in the developers,

514
00:29:49,076 --> 00:29:50,557
should be better at pitching,

515
00:29:52,405 --> 00:29:56,070
What are your ways of getting better at your job?

516
00:29:56,930 --> 00:30:02,817
Sorry for being cheeky, but you know, discarding games just by the fact that they don't have a screenshot.

517
00:30:03,898 --> 00:30:06,181
You might be missing out on quite a lot.

518
00:30:07,682 --> 00:30:08,523
Um, I think

519
00:30:09,139 --> 00:30:12,541
There's a chance we're missing out on stuff, but honestly, I don't think so.

520
00:30:12,581 --> 00:30:17,123
Because like, if a game doesn't show well to us, how are we going to market

521
00:30:17,183 --> 00:30:18,683
that to a larger audience?

522
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:23,205
Because your indie developer doesn't have to be as good at marketing as you are.

523
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,086
And that's what he's looking for.

524
00:30:25,106 --> 00:30:27,627
Yeah, that totally makes sense.

525
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:31,885
And I think like we look through at least at Armor Games.

526
00:30:32,085 --> 00:30:33,107
I can't speak for everyone.

527
00:30:33,147 --> 00:30:35,711
We look through every pitch and we look through.

528
00:30:37,433 --> 00:30:40,578
We don't like just archive emails instantly and we respond

529
00:30:40,598 --> 00:30:42,020
to every single pitch we receive.

530
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,350
And I think a lot of publishers are trying to do that.

531
00:30:45,491 --> 00:30:49,473
So it's not that it's literally rejected.

532
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:53,536
It's just like you get those 20 seconds or whatever.

533
00:30:53,616 --> 00:30:55,398
And it's just, I think a part of humanity

534
00:30:55,458 --> 00:30:57,719
that like either this person is getting excited

535
00:30:57,739 --> 00:30:59,080
about your game or they aren't.

536
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,982
And if they're not getting excited about their game

537
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:02,643
it's gonna be really hard to get signed.

538
00:31:04,164 --> 00:31:04,484
Gotcha.

539
00:31:04,944 --> 00:31:05,405
Yeah, thank you.
