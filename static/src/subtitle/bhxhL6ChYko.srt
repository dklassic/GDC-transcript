1
00:00:06,782 --> 00:00:08,683
Hello folks, apparently you can hear me.

2
00:00:10,485 --> 00:00:11,546
Thank you for being here.

3
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:16,190
I always remember going to see Jesse Schell at GDC,

4
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,891
or at South by Southwest,

5
00:00:18,512 --> 00:00:19,853
the first time South by Southwest

6
00:00:19,873 --> 00:00:21,174
tried to do a game design program.

7
00:00:21,815 --> 00:00:24,797
And he said, there are eight people in this room,

8
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,580
but I have a feeling they're the right eight people.

9
00:00:28,241 --> 00:00:29,442
And I always remember that story

10
00:00:29,502 --> 00:00:31,463
because I really expected to see eight people

11
00:00:31,503 --> 00:00:34,286
in this room today to talk about user experience design.

12
00:00:34,837 --> 00:00:37,518
and I think I might be looking between 80 and 800.

13
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,459
I come to you with a perfect storm.

14
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:41,380
I blew a tire.

15
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,740
The mechanic was late.

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,861
101 had an accident.

17
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:45,521
And now I have the wrong slides.

18
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:46,742
But I tell you what.

19
00:00:47,182 --> 00:00:50,943
I will do my very best, and you will ask me

20
00:00:51,063 --> 00:00:53,484
horrible, hard questions, which will make me weep.

21
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:57,166
And then I will give you free copies of my book

22
00:00:57,286 --> 00:00:57,966
to say thank you.

23
00:00:58,286 --> 00:01:01,147
So I've got five copies of a book.

24
00:01:01,187 --> 00:01:02,428
I hope that will gain me some goodwill.

25
00:01:03,388 --> 00:01:04,028
All right.

26
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:06,473
So here we are together and we're gonna talk about

27
00:01:06,553 --> 00:01:09,815
user experience design, which is so odd for me

28
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:12,217
because I have been doing user experience design

29
00:01:12,257 --> 00:01:13,318
for many, many years.

30
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,921
When it was called HCI, when it was called

31
00:01:16,941 --> 00:01:18,503
information architecture, when it was called

32
00:01:18,543 --> 00:01:21,165
interaction design, I've been doing it

33
00:01:21,325 --> 00:01:22,926
throughout all these name changes.

34
00:01:23,387 --> 00:01:26,189
Someday maybe you can explain to me why UX people

35
00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:28,211
have to rebrand themselves every few years.

36
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:29,892
I'm not sure I fully understand that.

37
00:01:31,313 --> 00:01:31,553
But.

38
00:01:32,295 --> 00:01:36,258
What's really weird to me is that you guys are hiring user experience designers now.

39
00:01:36,779 --> 00:01:41,102
And when I was asked to come here and speak about user experience design, I was kind of

40
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:44,324
shocked because I always thought you were designing experiences, right?

41
00:01:44,384 --> 00:01:44,984
You're already.

42
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:45,845
Okay.

43
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:46,566
Well, all right.

44
00:01:46,946 --> 00:01:51,609
And then I started talking to people and I was sent a million screenshots, which I would

45
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:54,031
love to show you, but I think you can imagine it, you know.

46
00:01:54,863 --> 00:02:00,445
The Witcher, some Final Fantasy things, like really horrifying menuing systems and heads

47
00:02:00,505 --> 00:02:04,646
up displays that you can't even read because they're sitting on top of the same colored

48
00:02:04,686 --> 00:02:05,186
designs.

49
00:02:06,027 --> 00:02:11,308
I think that there's a lot of use that's forgotten in the idea of play.

50
00:02:11,828 --> 00:02:15,049
So yeah, you would not work, wouldn't you?

51
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:18,590
Come on, come on.

52
00:02:20,711 --> 00:02:20,951
Yes!

53
00:02:21,171 --> 00:02:23,292
Well, apparently the finger is mightier than the clicky.

54
00:02:23,712 --> 00:02:23,892
Okay.

55
00:02:24,507 --> 00:02:30,752
So I teach now, I'm an associate professor of interaction design at California College

56
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:31,272
of the Arts.

57
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:37,016
I'm actually bringing the first game design courses to CCA and with a little bit of luck

58
00:02:37,036 --> 00:02:37,857
maybe even a minor.

59
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:39,418
It's very exciting to teach this stuff.

60
00:02:40,738 --> 00:02:45,621
You know, Stone LeBrand stood on the stage last year and blew me away because he started

61
00:02:45,681 --> 00:02:48,723
talking about design and that design was bigger than game.

62
00:02:49,423 --> 00:02:50,764
And he talked about Vitruvius.

63
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:54,166
Vitruvius was the very first designer of anything.

64
00:02:54,426 --> 00:03:00,390
And he always talked about firmitas, utilitas, and venutas.

65
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,230
I never say it right.

66
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:07,534
But that just means usability and durability and beauty.

67
00:03:08,248 --> 00:03:12,151
So a thing has to actually, you know, if I sit on this table, it shouldn't break.

68
00:03:13,171 --> 00:03:14,773
I should know that I can sit upon it.

69
00:03:15,313 --> 00:03:19,416
And maybe most importantly, it should look good, of which this table has lost it.

70
00:03:19,676 --> 00:03:21,117
Actually, I wouldn't say it's most important.

71
00:03:21,157 --> 00:03:24,600
Possibly the most important is probably that it doesn't fall apart.

72
00:03:27,482 --> 00:03:33,266
Don Norman, who wrote The Design of Everyday Things, talked about the three stools.

73
00:03:33,806 --> 00:03:35,568
And this to me sounds just like Vitruvius.

74
00:03:35,588 --> 00:03:36,388
We're talking about...

75
00:03:38,147 --> 00:03:39,548
Feasible, can we even build it?

76
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:40,790
We're talking about desirable,

77
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:41,871
does anybody want us to build it?

78
00:03:42,711 --> 00:03:44,773
I advise a lot of startups in the Silicon Valley,

79
00:03:44,793 --> 00:03:46,194
and I will tell you that leg of the stool

80
00:03:46,294 --> 00:03:47,536
is the one that's most forgotten.

81
00:03:48,116 --> 00:03:49,617
And then viable, can we build it

82
00:03:49,637 --> 00:03:50,939
and not go out of business doing it?

83
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:52,160
That is also often forgotten.

84
00:03:53,521 --> 00:03:54,562
So this is Don himself,

85
00:03:55,262 --> 00:03:57,624
and something really interesting happened

86
00:03:58,085 --> 00:04:00,187
when Apple first got popular.

87
00:04:00,727 --> 00:04:01,748
So I don't know, are you familiar

88
00:04:01,788 --> 00:04:03,389
with the idea of cargo cults?

89
00:04:04,397 --> 00:04:09,181
Cargo cults, yes. Cargo cults in the South Pacific, there were a bunch of islanders,

90
00:04:09,362 --> 00:04:13,365
and when the Americans were there, they would drop cargo there, and they would get food.

91
00:04:14,006 --> 00:04:20,151
And when the Americans left at the end of World War II, they built all these stick airplanes and

92
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:25,876
all these pretend airports with real runways, and they thought if they made the gods happy

93
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:29,319
and they built these icons to the gods, the gods would bring cargo to them.

94
00:04:30,106 --> 00:04:34,307
And when Apple very first launched their successful products like the iPod

95
00:04:35,407 --> 00:04:37,528
and then eventually the iPhone, what did we see?

96
00:04:37,908 --> 00:04:43,329
People started making white phones and people started making white everything.

97
00:04:43,869 --> 00:04:46,210
Apparently if you made things white, the consumers would buy it

98
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,870
and they put I in front of it.

99
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:51,731
There's the I-bud and the I-bod and I-this.

100
00:04:51,871 --> 00:04:54,372
I-bod is a vibrator, by the way, fun fact.

101
00:04:55,312 --> 00:04:59,053
Apparently if you look like Apple, you can sell happiness in all sorts of interesting ways.

102
00:05:01,132 --> 00:05:02,452
That's also user experience design.

103
00:05:02,932 --> 00:05:06,613
So this is what happens when my slides are wrong.

104
00:05:06,633 --> 00:05:07,714
I'm just going to make stuff up today.

105
00:05:08,094 --> 00:05:13,715
So Don is the fellow who actually coined the term user experience design.

106
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:20,317
And what he said was that user experience encompasses all, all aspects.

107
00:05:20,942 --> 00:05:23,744
of the user's experience and interactions with the company.

108
00:05:24,144 --> 00:05:28,207
And so what we have now is a whole generation of user experience designers who think they're

109
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:32,230
supposed to design the customer care and the marketing plan as well as the actual interface.

110
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:39,795
I think Amazon is a really good example of somebody who understands Dawn's vision for

111
00:05:39,835 --> 00:05:41,536
what user experience is actually supposed to be.

112
00:05:42,196 --> 00:05:46,720
So if you look at Amazon, it's one of the only places where I can get Tom Stoppard plays.

113
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,621
They're wonderful with a long tail, right?

114
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,923
They're able to take care of all sorts of pleasure.

115
00:05:52,104 --> 00:05:57,788
But they also know things about me with their recommendation systems, which is fairly incredible.

116
00:05:58,148 --> 00:06:02,131
You know, the fact that Amazon knows me well enough to know Linda Carter is very important to me

117
00:06:02,512 --> 00:06:05,074
is something I find very touching and increases my loyalty.

118
00:06:05,554 --> 00:06:07,916
And of course, it's all about the smiling boxes.

119
00:06:08,016 --> 00:06:11,138
Like, nothing's better than coming home to a big smile, right?

120
00:06:12,507 --> 00:06:14,388
And then there's the customer service piece.

121
00:06:15,068 --> 00:06:17,089
When the Kindle launched, it had this lady

122
00:06:17,109 --> 00:06:18,329
that you could click on her face

123
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:20,030
and suddenly somebody was talking to you.

124
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,511
And any problem could be answered instantly.

125
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,672
And this was a great way to start nibbling away

126
00:06:24,932 --> 00:06:28,154
at the Apple iPad market.

127
00:06:30,795 --> 00:06:33,136
So the first requirement is it has to meet

128
00:06:33,176 --> 00:06:36,838
the exact needs of the customer.

129
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,959
What are the exact needs of the customer?

130
00:06:39,718 --> 00:06:44,821
Well, one thing I think Amazon does that's a little bit magical is the day I saw subscriptions.

131
00:06:45,181 --> 00:06:49,463
Now, they could have just said, people buy these things over and over again, let's just

132
00:06:49,603 --> 00:06:50,504
get them to subscribe.

133
00:06:50,924 --> 00:06:54,986
But in this particular case, they actually predicted how often I would need to buy it.

134
00:06:55,107 --> 00:06:58,288
I have no idea how often I need razors, but they did.

135
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:02,128
And finally, a joy to use.

136
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:03,509
This is the stuff you guys get.

137
00:07:03,929 --> 00:07:04,930
You understand perfectly.

138
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,411
This is the stuff these experienced people

139
00:07:06,431 --> 00:07:07,031
don't always get.

140
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:10,013
I find it fascinating that Google does doodles.

141
00:07:10,073 --> 00:07:11,154
Have you ever questioned this?

142
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:14,916
If you ever study brands, you know there's one rule to brand

143
00:07:15,216 --> 00:07:16,897
and it is do not mess with the mark.

144
00:07:17,717 --> 00:07:20,179
You do not change the mark, you do not resize the mark,

145
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,620
you do not add things to the mark.

146
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,841
And Google's like, why?

147
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,342
Let's just do whatever we feel

148
00:07:25,382 --> 00:07:26,823
as long as it's fun and it's interesting.

149
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,551
So they break a lot of rules.

150
00:07:29,131 --> 00:07:30,712
Amazon also breaks a lot of rules.

151
00:07:30,832 --> 00:07:33,534
I'm sure you guys have seen some of these wonderful joke reviews.

152
00:07:34,835 --> 00:07:38,097
Common Sense says, let's get rid of these completely, right?

153
00:07:38,737 --> 00:07:41,799
This has got to be destroying our ability to do targeting.

154
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:43,480
This is undermining our brand.

155
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,221
We're trying to sell a bunch of different things.

156
00:07:45,641 --> 00:07:48,523
But instead, they let them live on.

157
00:07:48,904 --> 00:07:51,585
And I think these are a really, really wonderful way for the user

158
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:54,547
to shape the interface, connect to it, believe in it.

159
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:58,168
And I think that from the years I've been going to GDC,

160
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,969
I think you guys often struggle with these questions.

161
00:08:01,049 --> 00:08:02,049
How much customization?

162
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:03,129
Is the right customization?

163
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:03,890
What are the rules?

164
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:07,911
When can we allow these natural moments of excitement

165
00:08:07,951 --> 00:08:09,271
and interest to bubble up?

166
00:08:09,371 --> 00:08:11,692
And I think this is a very brave approach for them.

167
00:08:13,353 --> 00:08:15,393
As well, here we have, in order to...

168
00:08:15,955 --> 00:08:19,798
achieve high-quality user experience in a company's offering, there must be a

169
00:08:19,898 --> 00:08:24,201
seamless merging of services of multiple disciplines. I think this is one of the

170
00:08:24,281 --> 00:08:28,163
ones that is almost impossible for anybody to get right. And for this one

171
00:08:28,183 --> 00:08:33,247
I'm going to look at Mini Cooper. So I own a Mini Cooper. If you own a Mini

172
00:08:33,267 --> 00:08:37,790
Cooper, it's not just a car, it's a way of living in the world. It's a very

173
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:42,854
beautiful thing. Everything to the beautiful round steering wheel, to the

174
00:08:42,914 --> 00:08:43,794
fact that the...

175
00:08:44,864 --> 00:08:46,305
The gas gauge is in the wrong place.

176
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,485
And by the way, everybody who owns a Mini Cooper

177
00:08:48,525 --> 00:08:50,846
runs out of gas the first time on their first tank

178
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:53,167
because the gas gauge is not where it's supposed to be.

179
00:08:53,187 --> 00:08:54,127
It's somewhere in the middle.

180
00:08:55,227 --> 00:08:55,887
But you don't care.

181
00:08:55,947 --> 00:08:56,668
You forgive the car.

182
00:08:56,688 --> 00:08:57,248
You move on.

183
00:08:57,288 --> 00:08:57,968
You love it more.

184
00:08:58,088 --> 00:08:58,908
It's a wonderful thing.

185
00:08:59,688 --> 00:09:02,409
Little moments like the fact that the top doesn't just

186
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:02,789
go down.

187
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:04,510
It can go halfway down.

188
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,030
And your cat fits in it.

189
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:09,071
The other thing is that they really

190
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,972
did a good job of making this into a real phenomenon.

191
00:09:12,372 --> 00:09:13,452
They have the t-shirts.

192
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:14,613
They have the music.

193
00:09:16,612 --> 00:09:20,495
This actually came out the same time that the iPod already put a thousand songs in your pocket.

194
00:09:20,876 --> 00:09:25,660
They said, let's put every song we possibly can, but before Spotify, into your car.

195
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,403
So you can actually have any song that you could possibly want to listen to in the car.

196
00:09:29,804 --> 00:09:32,066
They actually supported driving clubs.

197
00:09:32,486 --> 00:09:36,347
And I think that not all of you know which game is going to be a success,

198
00:09:36,707 --> 00:09:40,068
but if you have a good sense that you're going to build something that's going to be wildly popular,

199
00:09:40,809 --> 00:09:44,590
like Lego Dimensions recently, you know, there's some brilliant work going on right there.

200
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,971
They have the community, they have the toys, they have the video,

201
00:09:48,411 --> 00:09:51,172
everything feeds into everything which feeds into everything else.

202
00:09:51,212 --> 00:09:53,132
And there's a completeness to that user experience.

203
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:56,573
I'm going to question whether a user experience designer

204
00:09:56,613 --> 00:09:58,914
could design the completeness of that user experience.

205
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:06,948
Now, Jesse James Garrett is the guy who popularized the term.

206
00:10:06,988 --> 00:10:10,590
Don Norman may have coined it, but I think the reason we have user experience designer

207
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,552
is this guy's reason.

208
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,093
And by the way, I think this is the first GDC he's ever missed.

209
00:10:15,194 --> 00:10:17,355
He's always sitting there in the back, quiet and invisible.

210
00:10:18,296 --> 00:10:22,258
If he knew how many people would be in this room, I think he would not skip this year's.

211
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:27,802
It's a design of anything independent of medium or cross device with human experience as

212
00:10:27,822 --> 00:10:31,285
an explicit outcome and human engagement as an explicit goal.

213
00:10:32,073 --> 00:10:35,674
Now I will tell you, I was on to Twitter last night,

214
00:10:36,354 --> 00:10:37,895
and his business partner was saying,

215
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:40,736
game design is a subset of user experience design.

216
00:10:41,436 --> 00:10:43,877
And I said, I promise to say that to the audience

217
00:10:44,137 --> 00:10:45,778
and time how long they laugh at me.

218
00:10:46,478 --> 00:10:50,499
Um, I think that there is a really interesting question

219
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:52,800
about what's the bigger and what's the smaller

220
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,281
and what does it mean to design a complete experience.

221
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:58,682
However, when he went ahead and modeled it out,

222
00:10:59,202 --> 00:11:01,283
he kind of held it down a little bit.

223
00:11:01,558 --> 00:11:04,580
He actually designed the experience of use.

224
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,282
And I think this is the definition that is a lot more relevant to everybody in this room.

225
00:11:08,783 --> 00:11:11,945
How do we design the experience of use?

226
00:11:12,025 --> 00:11:17,668
You are already designing the experience of play, but play cannot be accessed without

227
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:21,191
being able to use the interface, the HUD, everything else.

228
00:11:21,811 --> 00:11:27,335
So when we take a look at his model, we have everything from understanding users all the

229
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,897
way up through visual design and information architecture.

230
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:34,174
Again, wrong slides, apologizing for the size of the font, moving on with my life.

231
00:11:35,054 --> 00:11:43,821
I think the three key parts of designing for the actual use are user interface, information

232
00:11:43,881 --> 00:11:46,804
architecture, and interaction design.

233
00:11:47,284 --> 00:11:49,146
Now, I think...

234
00:11:50,326 --> 00:11:55,389
90% of you guys probably think that user experience is just user interface design.

235
00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:01,413
And I read a really fascinating Quora answer by Raf Koster, who I beg not to come today,

236
00:12:02,134 --> 00:12:07,317
because he said that user experience is mostly about designing an interface.

237
00:12:08,038 --> 00:12:16,484
And I think that is a huge loss, because we can't put lipstick on a pig, and I don't think

238
00:12:16,504 --> 00:12:17,705
we should spend the time doing that.

239
00:12:19,577 --> 00:12:23,480
So if we think about the entire user experience design

240
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,602
from marketing all the way to customer service

241
00:12:25,962 --> 00:12:26,823
from the beginning to the end,

242
00:12:27,203 --> 00:12:28,404
I think it's really in that circle

243
00:12:28,444 --> 00:12:29,425
where you guys are gonna choose

244
00:12:29,445 --> 00:12:31,006
to hire your user experience designers.

245
00:12:32,187 --> 00:12:33,828
So there are a lot of things that you should know

246
00:12:33,868 --> 00:12:36,390
that come out of the history of user experience design.

247
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,171
Like I said, it used to be called HCI.

248
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:40,093
I'm gonna argue it's the exact same thing.

249
00:12:41,074 --> 00:12:43,135
There are some universal principles.

250
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,351
that are built off cognitive psychology.

251
00:12:47,491 --> 00:12:49,792
The Design of Everyday Things talks about them.

252
00:12:50,832 --> 00:12:54,013
Jeff Johnson's highly underrated Gooey Bloopers

253
00:12:54,553 --> 00:12:57,034
talks a lot about those psychological principles.

254
00:12:57,914 --> 00:13:00,895
Designing With the Mind in Mind is available on the Googles,

255
00:13:00,955 --> 00:13:01,956
and it's very good to watch.

256
00:13:03,356 --> 00:13:06,377
But Alan Cooper, who wrote The Inmates Are Running the Asylum,

257
00:13:06,417 --> 00:13:10,158
said, like putting an Armani suit on Attila the Hun,

258
00:13:10,218 --> 00:13:10,959
we cannot.

259
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:17,342
good interface design only classes up existing behavior,

260
00:13:17,402 --> 00:13:19,243
which means if you don't have the behavior right,

261
00:13:19,664 --> 00:13:20,945
you're just trying to make it look pretty.

262
00:13:21,785 --> 00:13:24,447
So one of the key concepts is affordances.

263
00:13:24,968 --> 00:13:26,529
And I think we see affordances all the time.

264
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:28,350
If you've read The Design of Everyday Things,

265
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,432
you cannot walk through a door without complaining about it.

266
00:13:33,574 --> 00:13:35,835
You want a handle to say pull.

267
00:13:36,136 --> 00:13:38,177
You want a flat surface to say push.

268
00:13:39,338 --> 00:13:40,559
My friend Aaron Hoffman said,

269
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,400
Monument Valley is the most UX.

270
00:13:43,085 --> 00:13:46,531
game she's ever played. I'm going to assume you've all played it if you haven't.

271
00:13:48,575 --> 00:13:52,061
I'm so sorry. It's a beautiful game. It's tiny. It doesn't you can actually play to

272
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,365
the end, which I think most game designers have given up on.

273
00:13:56,555 --> 00:13:59,496
but it is the most affordancy game I've ever seen in my life.

274
00:13:59,536 --> 00:14:01,617
You know, you've got these handles that you can turn,

275
00:14:01,637 --> 00:14:04,679
you've got buttons that can be pushed, everything moves.

276
00:14:04,739 --> 00:14:07,561
It's like when you're doing the beautiful direct manipulation

277
00:14:07,621 --> 00:14:09,902
of handling it with an iPod,

278
00:14:09,942 --> 00:14:12,083
it's one of the most satisfying experiences ever

279
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,204
because everything looks like it can be touched.

280
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,212
and an iPod, everything can be touched.

281
00:14:16,232 --> 00:14:18,475
And you don't have that mouse intermediating for you,

282
00:14:18,515 --> 00:14:19,617
which is very satisfying.

283
00:14:20,518 --> 00:14:22,961
There was a huge fuss when flat came out.

284
00:14:23,382 --> 00:14:25,985
So there was this big stylistic decision.

285
00:14:26,045 --> 00:14:28,829
And by the way, I think Apple is no longer

286
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:30,011
a user experience company.

287
00:14:30,051 --> 00:14:31,553
I think they're a fashion company.

288
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:37,101
because they gave up skeuomorphism, which makes buttons that look pushable,

289
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:39,302
makes everything look like you can touch it,

290
00:14:39,582 --> 00:14:41,763
and made everything flat like a Mondrian.

291
00:14:42,063 --> 00:14:43,323
It was almost like one day they said,

292
00:14:43,363 --> 00:14:46,064
you know, usability is out, but flat is beautiful,

293
00:14:46,124 --> 00:14:48,245
and let's go on to make everything pretty.

294
00:14:48,825 --> 00:14:50,805
And as well as that, they did it overnight,

295
00:14:50,825 --> 00:14:52,866
and all of a sudden you couldn't see any of the icons.

296
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:53,806
Everything looked different.

297
00:14:54,607 --> 00:14:57,527
I have a wonderful video of a small child crying in the face of flat.

298
00:14:58,088 --> 00:14:59,728
But beyond just...

299
00:15:00,068 --> 00:15:00,648
No, I'm not kidding.

300
00:15:01,489 --> 00:15:06,311
Beyond flat, being pretty and being elegant,

301
00:15:06,611 --> 00:15:07,812
if it doesn't look pushable,

302
00:15:07,912 --> 00:15:10,453
all we need is like a little tiny bit of 3D

303
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:11,933
and the buttons would read as buttons.

304
00:15:13,514 --> 00:15:15,675
This is another interesting example.

305
00:15:15,735 --> 00:15:15,855
So.

306
00:15:16,892 --> 00:15:20,256
I have worked with A-B testing for probably 15 years.

307
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:24,560
I was lucky I worked in search, I worked in Zynga, I worked at LinkedIn, I put in A-B

308
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,661
testing systems.

309
00:15:25,981 --> 00:15:30,065
And I will tell you one of the most amazing things you can do is tell people what to do.

310
00:15:30,465 --> 00:15:34,509
You will make all your numbers go up right now if you simply put a label on that says

311
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:35,310
click here.

312
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,232
And if the button looks buttonable and if the text looks...

313
00:15:39,353 --> 00:15:41,594
like you can write in it, it will change everything.

314
00:15:42,034 --> 00:15:44,075
What I found fascinating, and I haven't seen

315
00:15:44,896 --> 00:15:47,297
other people try this, is if you take the hints

316
00:15:47,617 --> 00:15:49,418
out of the box and put it underneath the box,

317
00:15:49,838 --> 00:15:51,379
you will increase data input.

318
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:54,140
I've tested this A-B testing several times.

319
00:15:54,741 --> 00:15:55,781
I haven't seen anybody write it up,

320
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,082
but it makes sense, right?

321
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,203
Because if you have something fairly flat like this

322
00:15:59,243 --> 00:16:00,163
and you put the text in there,

323
00:16:00,203 --> 00:16:01,624
it looks like a button or an instruction

324
00:16:01,644 --> 00:16:02,384
that's been decorated.

325
00:16:02,905 --> 00:16:05,106
So simply saying I am a form,

326
00:16:05,146 --> 00:16:06,627
maybe put a blinking cursor in there.

327
00:16:07,015 --> 00:16:08,936
It's an invitation, it's an affordance.

328
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:10,978
Meaning.

329
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:15,000
This is something I will say is always very confusing to me.

330
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:24,165
I feel like there's a lack of understanding of the historical learning that we have built

331
00:16:24,686 --> 00:16:25,726
into our interfaces.

332
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:31,850
So there's a wonderful expression from the book, I don't remember the name of the book,

333
00:16:35,605 --> 00:16:38,166
Intuition is compressed experience.

334
00:16:38,946 --> 00:16:41,507
And I think intuition is compressed experience

335
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,008
is the number one thing to keep in mind

336
00:16:44,548 --> 00:16:47,309
when we are designing an interface

337
00:16:47,349 --> 00:16:49,270
that we wish to be intuitive.

338
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,571
What does it mean to be intuitive?

339
00:16:52,051 --> 00:16:56,332
It means that we are using pre-existing interfaces

340
00:16:56,372 --> 00:16:57,513
and pre-existing metaphors.

341
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,274
So, for example, it's very simple.

342
00:17:00,994 --> 00:17:03,415
We should know what something loading looks like.

343
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,581
A gray link means it's not available.

344
00:17:07,102 --> 00:17:09,423
A hot link means that it is available.

345
00:17:11,624 --> 00:17:14,305
Links make them colorful, make them clickable.

346
00:17:14,706 --> 00:17:17,507
This is really, really basic stuff and gets thrown out.

347
00:17:18,508 --> 00:17:22,030
I've heard designers say, well, everybody knows just to run your mouse over and when

348
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:24,691
it turns into a finger, you can click it.

349
00:17:25,631 --> 00:17:29,553
Do we think we want our users trying to navigate by Braille?

350
00:17:29,654 --> 00:17:31,655
That seems unpleasant to me.

351
00:17:42,407 --> 00:17:44,169
Set expectations, meet expectations.

352
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,152
This is one of the most important things

353
00:17:46,172 --> 00:17:48,696
that I can think of when we're trying to do UX design.

354
00:17:50,439 --> 00:17:54,465
So what's wonderful here is when we have a tweet,

355
00:17:54,705 --> 00:17:57,009
you click it, it'll actually give you a message.

356
00:17:57,527 --> 00:18:02,128
Facebook, as you know, will show you a preview about what you're actually going to send.

357
00:18:03,728 --> 00:18:05,529
It will show it at the top of your stream.

358
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:11,110
What you may not know is when I went to put this behavior into the LinkedIn stream and

359
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,050
get it designed, it turned out we had to do a hack.

360
00:18:13,431 --> 00:18:17,212
Because if you have a lot of connections, the top thing will not be your actual update.

361
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:20,384
But if people don't see their update at the top of the stream,

362
00:18:20,444 --> 00:18:22,906
they will submit it over and over and over and over again.

363
00:18:23,346 --> 00:18:28,010
So what we had to do is we had to force-push the update you just

364
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:30,472
shared at the top to avoid duplicate updates.

365
00:18:31,213 --> 00:18:34,396
And otherwise, we didn't have enough real-time opportunity

366
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,097
to disambiguate the extra updates.

367
00:18:36,838 --> 00:18:39,320
One of the things that I think AlphaBear does really beautifully,

368
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:44,064
is SpryFoxes, is they will give you an actual image.

369
00:18:44,829 --> 00:18:46,951
of what it's going to look like on Facebook.

370
00:18:47,271 --> 00:18:48,853
So one of the fascinating things that we learned

371
00:18:48,953 --> 00:18:51,195
when I was working at LinkedIn is that people

372
00:18:51,435 --> 00:18:54,217
are terrified to share updates on LinkedIn.

373
00:18:54,398 --> 00:18:55,559
And I thought that was really funny.

374
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:56,680
Don't you want to promote yourself?

375
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,321
Don't you want to become a big, important person?

376
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,303
And it turns out that people are scared

377
00:19:00,463 --> 00:19:02,244
of social cost of sharing.

378
00:19:02,585 --> 00:19:04,586
And having worked at Zynga, I will tell you

379
00:19:04,626 --> 00:19:06,628
that we interviewed a ton of people who would say,

380
00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:10,412
we cannot, we won't click on the shares anymore

381
00:19:10,472 --> 00:19:11,813
because my friends are yelling at me.

382
00:19:12,562 --> 00:19:14,923
So knowing what the update's going to look like,

383
00:19:15,023 --> 00:19:17,864
knowing how you can customize it,

384
00:19:17,904 --> 00:19:19,364
making sure that people can take care

385
00:19:19,404 --> 00:19:20,604
of their social credibility,

386
00:19:21,044 --> 00:19:23,125
is incredibly important to be effective.

387
00:19:23,525 --> 00:19:25,746
So the feedback has to be set expectations,

388
00:19:25,786 --> 00:19:27,906
meet expectations, but also letting people

389
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:29,727
shape their brand and their social circles.

390
00:19:35,628 --> 00:19:36,588
I'm gonna skip this.

391
00:19:36,948 --> 00:19:38,929
Recognition over recall, this is another good one.

392
00:19:40,477 --> 00:19:43,218
So there's also been a lot of studies around the hamburger menu.

393
00:19:43,779 --> 00:19:46,360
So the hamburger menu, I assume you're all familiar with it,

394
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,561
it's that series of lines.

395
00:19:48,001 --> 00:19:50,543
It turns out it's actually a low-performing tool.

396
00:19:51,003 --> 00:19:53,084
The hamburger menu, most people don't recognize it,

397
00:19:53,104 --> 00:19:54,705
they don't know what to do with it.

398
00:19:55,426 --> 00:19:58,768
And it's because the problem is recognition over recall.

399
00:19:58,848 --> 00:20:01,109
People don't know what that looks like yet.

400
00:20:01,189 --> 00:20:04,371
I'm not sure when they're going to start figuring it out.

401
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,372
It still has very low uptakes.

402
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:09,915
What turned out to be much more effective was simply the word menu.

403
00:20:11,217 --> 00:20:13,438
Now obviously there's localization problems with that,

404
00:20:13,718 --> 00:20:16,339
but a combination of menu and then the hamburger,

405
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,481
and then perhaps over time you could reduce it,

406
00:20:19,621 --> 00:20:21,823
allows you to get a significantly better click-through.

407
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:24,524
Unfortunately the data's white, like I said, wrong deck.

408
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:26,905
How about carousels?

409
00:20:27,586 --> 00:20:30,047
I notice that more and more folks are starting to adopt carousels,

410
00:20:30,127 --> 00:20:32,749
both on their front page where they're selling their games.

411
00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:38,071
What's really fascinating about carousels is that...

412
00:20:39,148 --> 00:20:41,916
Nobody knows what those buttons mean.

413
00:20:42,076 --> 00:20:42,919
You know, those little dots?

414
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:44,403
Like, why would I click on the third dot?

415
00:20:44,503 --> 00:20:46,649
None of those dots actually have any semantic meaning.

416
00:20:47,652 --> 00:20:50,413
And so I was talking to PJ who works at Amazon,

417
00:20:50,593 --> 00:20:53,054
and the merchants always wanted carousels.

418
00:20:53,094 --> 00:20:55,094
They were really excited about using carousels

419
00:20:55,134 --> 00:20:55,714
in their design.

420
00:20:56,114 --> 00:20:58,895
The problem was that they converted horribly.

421
00:20:58,915 --> 00:21:01,956
There's a massive drop down from the first slide

422
00:21:01,976 --> 00:21:03,916
to the second slide, which means if you're

423
00:21:03,936 --> 00:21:05,236
on the second slide, you're doomed,

424
00:21:05,456 --> 00:21:07,277
and if you're on the third and fourth slide,

425
00:21:07,317 --> 00:21:08,997
you're doomed-er than doomed.

426
00:21:09,737 --> 00:21:12,058
And therefore, you go back to the problem

427
00:21:12,078 --> 00:21:13,958
of everybody fighting over wanting to be the first slide.

428
00:21:15,977 --> 00:21:18,901
So you shouldn't use carousels except maybe you should.

429
00:21:19,402 --> 00:21:21,965
So they asked themselves, what if carousels worked?

430
00:21:22,025 --> 00:21:23,687
Which is like one of my favorite questions in the world.

431
00:21:23,927 --> 00:21:26,070
What would it look like if we could design a carousel

432
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,512
that actually functioned correctly?

433
00:21:27,872 --> 00:21:30,916
And it turned out that the secret was, for Amazon,

434
00:21:31,317 --> 00:21:32,238
get rid of the little dots.

435
00:21:33,763 --> 00:21:36,765
recognition over recall, and clear affordances.

436
00:21:37,185 --> 00:21:39,386
So they just made, instead of those little dots,

437
00:21:39,726 --> 00:21:41,307
clear pictures of what was behind them,

438
00:21:41,747 --> 00:21:42,748
and all the numbers went up.

439
00:21:43,248 --> 00:21:45,489
So clear affordances, recognition over recall.

440
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:47,811
Use clear language.

441
00:21:48,331 --> 00:21:50,032
This is another problem I see in game design.

442
00:21:50,072 --> 00:21:51,173
People like the cute word.

443
00:21:51,213 --> 00:21:53,194
They wanna make all the navigation on brand.

444
00:21:53,614 --> 00:21:55,675
Let me tell you, I've A-B tested this for 20 years.

445
00:21:56,536 --> 00:21:58,337
Just be obvious, be unsubtle.

446
00:21:59,157 --> 00:22:01,478
Be cute in the game, don't be cute in the menuing system.

447
00:22:03,581 --> 00:22:04,542
Contextual principles.

448
00:22:04,862 --> 00:22:08,725
So there was a wonderful talk given two years ago, I think,

449
00:22:08,925 --> 00:22:11,427
by the FarmVille 2 folks, they're post-mortem.

450
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:15,070
And they talked about what they called creative pillars.

451
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,111
And they decided what was actually

452
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:18,252
important to FarmVille.

453
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:22,435
So here we see, if you were designing a restaurant site,

454
00:22:22,595 --> 00:22:23,396
what really matters?

455
00:22:23,616 --> 00:22:25,637
Well, a recipe should be scannable.

456
00:22:26,698 --> 00:22:28,900
Users should know where they are in the recipe.

457
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,622
Am I at the place where things are boiling?

458
00:22:32,609 --> 00:22:33,750
That's the place where things are burning.

459
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,352
And you should be able to find the ingredients that you can buy.

460
00:22:37,392 --> 00:22:41,234
And what's really nice about this recipe is you can use the left-hand side as

461
00:22:41,634 --> 00:22:46,157
a shopping list, but then it also shows you where the ingredients are landing and

462
00:22:46,177 --> 00:22:46,737
the instructions.

463
00:22:46,777 --> 00:22:48,838
This is actually how Julia Child does all her recipes.

464
00:22:49,379 --> 00:22:52,460
So with Farmville, they came up with these creative principles that were all about

465
00:22:52,821 --> 00:22:56,082
your farm should be alive, it should always be in motion, it should be growing,

466
00:22:56,102 --> 00:22:58,604
it should be changing, and those drove every design decision.

467
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:01,586
Tevo is also very famous for their.

468
00:23:03,312 --> 00:23:05,533
for their contextual principles.

469
00:23:06,193 --> 00:23:08,875
And sadly, TiVo was incredibly successful.

470
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:10,035
It was a wonderful experience.

471
00:23:10,335 --> 00:23:13,016
And then Comcast copied,

472
00:23:13,617 --> 00:23:15,477
it was like an opposite cargo cult.

473
00:23:15,697 --> 00:23:17,858
They copied all the functionality and none of the beauty.

474
00:23:19,339 --> 00:23:21,380
But it seems to have hurt poor TiVo.

475
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,780
But it was very smart and they showed the way.

476
00:23:24,241 --> 00:23:27,182
So there are things you do as well.

477
00:23:27,863 --> 00:23:29,143
So in order to be more effective,

478
00:23:29,523 --> 00:23:31,684
you must observe in order to understand,

479
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:32,765
you need to analyze.

480
00:23:33,514 --> 00:23:37,177
and then you need to create more things that you can test over and over again.

481
00:23:37,497 --> 00:23:39,599
This is a quick sketch I do for my students.

482
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,483
I hope that you all do playtesting.

483
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,485
I'm very shocked if you don't.

484
00:23:46,565 --> 00:23:49,567
I understand that there are game designers who don't do playtesting at Zynga.

485
00:23:50,027 --> 00:23:51,789
Every Friday there'd be users there,

486
00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:54,111
and if you didn't have something for the players to play...

487
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:57,343
your job was definitely questionable and on the line.

488
00:23:57,383 --> 00:23:59,244
And I'm gonna just remind people that when I was at Zynga,

489
00:23:59,264 --> 00:24:00,525
they were not dying and miserable.

490
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:01,946
They were healthy and exciting,

491
00:24:01,966 --> 00:24:03,206
and it was an interesting place to be.

492
00:24:03,266 --> 00:24:04,347
And I think they were very smart.

493
00:24:04,787 --> 00:24:07,069
Since I left, I can't really say what happened after that.

494
00:24:07,469 --> 00:24:08,569
I swear it wasn't me.

495
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,651
I didn't break it on my way out.

496
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:13,712
But that rhythm of playtesting is absolutely critical.

497
00:24:13,732 --> 00:24:14,913
And what's fascinating to me is now

498
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:15,934
that I'm teaching game design,

499
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,194
I see students building games,

500
00:24:17,715 --> 00:24:19,996
and then it looks beautiful,

501
00:24:20,036 --> 00:24:20,916
it looks like it's gonna work,

502
00:24:20,956 --> 00:24:22,998
the rule set's perfect, they test it, and it dies.

503
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:24,449
It doesn't play well.

504
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:27,010
So it's the same thing with user experience.

505
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,410
We must test and test and test.

506
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,210
We must observe.

507
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,831
There's a ton of methodologies

508
00:24:30,871 --> 00:24:33,231
that you guys can pull on observation.

509
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,713
Contextual inquiry is one of my favorites.

510
00:24:38,253 --> 00:24:40,794
So as well, there was a woman who worked

511
00:24:40,834 --> 00:24:43,415
on the very first FarmVille that Zynga released.

512
00:24:44,075 --> 00:24:44,835
And thank you.

513
00:24:45,335 --> 00:24:47,736
And she always talked about the fact.

514
00:24:48,109 --> 00:24:49,670
that it was a one-handed game.

515
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:52,253
Farmville and porn apparently are the two things

516
00:24:52,273 --> 00:24:53,454
that you consume one-handed,

517
00:24:53,494 --> 00:24:55,115
for completely different reasons, by the way.

518
00:24:55,575 --> 00:24:57,617
So the reason you play Farmville one-handed

519
00:24:57,977 --> 00:25:00,800
is because you have on your knee a baby.

520
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,102
And you're playing, possibly left-handed,

521
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:05,964
while you're bouncing the baby on your knee.

522
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:08,366
So if you did not know that,

523
00:25:08,446 --> 00:25:10,447
you would build in crazy keyboard shortcuts,

524
00:25:10,487 --> 00:25:11,348
a lot of complexity.

525
00:25:11,628 --> 00:25:13,950
If you do not watch people in their natural habitat,

526
00:25:14,271 --> 00:25:16,032
you will not understand what's going on.

527
00:25:16,252 --> 00:25:17,733
And I think Apple and Google Maps,

528
00:25:18,244 --> 00:25:21,485
both don't realize that their music and their Maps products

529
00:25:21,845 --> 00:25:24,126
are being made in the two seconds while you're driving.

530
00:25:25,747 --> 00:25:28,208
Because right now, every time I try to play a song while I'm driving,

531
00:25:28,548 --> 00:25:32,209
Apple tries to sell me a news or radio or something.

532
00:25:32,509 --> 00:25:33,870
So think about context.

533
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,771
Usability testing, this should be a gimme.

534
00:25:36,791 --> 00:25:39,672
I will tell you I play enough games to know that none of you are doing it.

535
00:25:43,277 --> 00:25:46,397
Finally, analyze your information.

536
00:25:46,677 --> 00:25:48,618
So I've got to say that this is a step

537
00:25:48,638 --> 00:25:50,078
that gets skipped all the time.

538
00:25:50,118 --> 00:25:50,958
It's not done very well.

539
00:25:51,198 --> 00:25:52,818
What I see people do is they go through their notes

540
00:25:52,838 --> 00:25:55,159
and they go, okay, we should fix these three things.

541
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:59,500
I think it's incredibly important to take every insight

542
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,700
and put it on your Post-it notes

543
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,900
and then rearrange them and rearrange them

544
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,721
and rearrange them.

545
00:26:05,201 --> 00:26:07,281
First, try taking all those observations

546
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:08,961
about how people live and how people play

547
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,862
and do a classic affinity sort.

548
00:26:11,702 --> 00:26:12,882
How do things kind of hang together?

549
00:26:13,506 --> 00:26:16,648
Then, try doing it by frequency.

550
00:26:16,768 --> 00:26:18,229
How often do these things happen?

551
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,290
By figuring out how often happens,

552
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,711
you know what you really have to fix.

553
00:26:21,751 --> 00:26:22,672
What do you have to make better?

554
00:26:23,493 --> 00:26:24,633
Put it along a timeline.

555
00:26:24,933 --> 00:26:26,835
What does it look like at the beginning of the gameplay?

556
00:26:26,855 --> 00:26:28,256
What does it look throughout the gameplay?

557
00:26:28,276 --> 00:26:29,957
What does it look like at the end of the gameplay?

558
00:26:32,138 --> 00:26:34,199
It's classic Amy Jo Kim stuff, right?

559
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,361
If any of you are old enough to remember her work

560
00:26:36,401 --> 00:26:37,362
about the player's journey,

561
00:26:37,682 --> 00:26:39,143
you know, you wanna design every piece of it.

562
00:26:41,367 --> 00:26:43,668
So there are a lot of insights in the data,

563
00:26:43,708 --> 00:26:46,069
and every time you rearrange it, you see new findings,

564
00:26:46,089 --> 00:26:47,150
and you discover new things.

565
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,571
We are in a very competitive business right now.

566
00:26:49,931 --> 00:26:51,972
We have to find ways to be the best out there,

567
00:26:52,232 --> 00:26:54,633
and it's worth the extra five minutes

568
00:26:54,693 --> 00:26:57,295
rearranging Post-it notes to find a potential thing

569
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:58,495
that might let you be successful.

570
00:26:59,516 --> 00:27:01,357
Finally, make things, make things, make things,

571
00:27:01,917 --> 00:27:03,177
make things, making, make things.

572
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:04,938
You don't know what's true until you've made it.

573
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:10,061
So IA, UX, interaction design.

574
00:27:11,007 --> 00:27:11,767
It all hangs together.

575
00:27:12,527 --> 00:27:14,468
Observe and understand your people.

576
00:27:16,088 --> 00:27:19,609
Be sure that you can organize your content,

577
00:27:19,649 --> 00:27:21,150
your menu systems need to make sense,

578
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,451
design the behavior you would like to see,

579
00:27:23,951 --> 00:27:24,971
and communicate clearly.

580
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:27,112
User experience is really big.

581
00:27:27,672 --> 00:27:30,773
That's why Peter thinks that play is within it.

582
00:27:30,813 --> 00:27:32,834
But I think the very heart of user experience

583
00:27:32,874 --> 00:27:34,534
is actually really, really, really tiny.

584
00:27:34,955 --> 00:27:36,795
Just about the user's experience.

585
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:41,038
Follow the known principles, finish with the user, test during design.

586
00:27:41,878 --> 00:27:43,139
Everyone must care for the user.

587
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:50,183
So let's talk about it, and I would like to give you as many books as I can,

588
00:27:50,224 --> 00:27:51,324
because they're heavy.

589
00:27:51,785 --> 00:27:53,766
So thank you.

590
00:27:53,866 --> 00:27:54,366
Thank you all.

591
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:03,592
Also, read those books.

592
00:28:05,293 --> 00:28:07,034
Sir, good fast move.

593
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:08,379
I was right there.

594
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,102
So when we start making games, usually we start with like doing a rapid prototype of

595
00:28:14,142 --> 00:28:15,622
like the core mechanic and this kind of stuff.

596
00:28:16,683 --> 00:28:21,124
But my understanding of making things on mobile and web would be that you start maybe with

597
00:28:21,164 --> 00:28:26,166
like wireframes, paper prototype, personas, user flows, like this kind of thing.

598
00:28:26,907 --> 00:28:27,807
Do you think that...

599
00:28:29,282 --> 00:28:33,549
The first steps we take to building a game could be different and there's stuff that we're skipping.

600
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:37,575
Wireframes are a lie. Nobody should ever make wireframes. Stop making wireframes.

601
00:28:38,075 --> 00:28:41,400
They're not good for anybody. They're dreadful. Just no more.

602
00:28:42,161 --> 00:28:42,642
Sketch.

603
00:28:44,425 --> 00:28:44,585
And...

604
00:28:45,415 --> 00:28:48,897
than design. You don't need to make coloring books.

605
00:28:50,077 --> 00:28:53,379
Should you guys be making things differently? It's really funny because when I talk about

606
00:28:53,419 --> 00:28:57,502
learning from game design to UX people, I always talk about Bartle's persona types

607
00:28:57,542 --> 00:29:01,304
and engagement style, and I think it's really powerful. The opposite for you guys

608
00:29:01,344 --> 00:29:04,445
would be to think about the elements of personas that are always there.

609
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:09,088
So, what other tools do they use? What are they familiar with?

610
00:29:09,168 --> 00:29:10,749
What's their visual vocabulary?

611
00:29:12,046 --> 00:29:14,888
What, are they technically savvy?

612
00:29:14,948 --> 00:29:17,470
Are they, I worked on shockwave.com

613
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:20,392
and when they were trying to redo it in the 90s,

614
00:29:20,412 --> 00:29:22,773
they found out they had two kinds of people.

615
00:29:22,813 --> 00:29:24,414
They had tough, young skateboarder kids

616
00:29:24,454 --> 00:29:25,715
who loved making things blow up

617
00:29:26,096 --> 00:29:28,557
and grandmothers playing the crossword puzzles

618
00:29:28,697 --> 00:29:29,998
who would call customer service

619
00:29:30,038 --> 00:29:31,920
anytime anything was changed.

620
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:35,582
And when they figured out that, they did choose what interface.

621
00:29:35,602 --> 00:29:39,024
They actually made the interface harder to drive away the grandmothers,

622
00:29:39,104 --> 00:29:42,225
which I think a lot of hardcore game designers are doing today.

623
00:29:42,766 --> 00:29:45,187
So I think that taking something for personas is good.

624
00:29:45,247 --> 00:29:46,028
Don't do wireframes.

625
00:29:46,168 --> 00:29:47,689
Just make lots of paper things.

626
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,550
Make paper things and play with them. That's good.

627
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,791
So come up and get your book, and I'll go to the other side.

628
00:29:51,811 --> 00:29:53,752
Yep.

629
00:29:57,114 --> 00:29:58,695
But if you find me later, I might have more.

630
00:30:00,016 --> 00:30:00,876
I'm going to have books every day.

631
00:30:02,124 --> 00:30:03,265
So you can find me later.

632
00:30:04,686 --> 00:30:05,066
It could be.

633
00:30:05,647 --> 00:30:06,367
Question.

634
00:30:06,768 --> 00:30:06,828
Hi.

635
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,568
Great talk, by the way.

636
00:30:07,989 --> 00:30:10,671
I have a question in terms of user experience and cross-culture.

637
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:12,672
Do you find yourself finding new...

638
00:30:12,752 --> 00:30:13,152
Questions.

639
00:30:13,232 --> 00:30:13,913
They're for questions.

640
00:30:14,033 --> 00:30:14,594
Find me later.

641
00:30:15,014 --> 00:30:18,156
...new challenges when you're actually featuring different cultures?

642
00:30:18,456 --> 00:30:18,536
What?

643
00:30:18,556 --> 00:30:21,599
Some of these principles are universal, but I'm wondering if they actually vary depending

644
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:23,560
on the culture or geographic location you're in.

645
00:30:25,415 --> 00:30:29,900
I heard that you're looking for what changes by culture, but is that just enough of the question?

646
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,042
That's enough of the question.

647
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:37,850
Okay, so yes, everything changes by culture. People have different dialogues that they use and...

648
00:30:38,752 --> 00:30:41,152
I'm going to have to put these up here because people want to grab them and I know you want

649
00:30:41,232 --> 00:30:42,813
one and I'm going to make sure they don't disappear.

650
00:30:43,213 --> 00:30:44,914
So of course everything changes by culture.

651
00:30:45,034 --> 00:30:46,674
We have different visual explanations.

652
00:30:46,994 --> 00:30:51,456
The problem with the word menu is it doesn't change, but we don't know do those lines mean

653
00:30:51,496 --> 00:30:51,956
anything.

654
00:30:51,996 --> 00:30:53,917
We've always talked about gestural problems.

655
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:59,418
If you have a character in your game and they're going, okay, this means F off.

656
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:00,998
in a lot of different cultures.

657
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:04,620
So absolutely, everything, absolutely everything

658
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,841
has cultural context.

659
00:31:06,201 --> 00:31:07,542
This is my point about intuition.

660
00:31:07,582 --> 00:31:09,623
There's no such thing as inborn intuition.

661
00:31:09,683 --> 00:31:12,084
Intuition is compressed experience,

662
00:31:12,425 --> 00:31:15,286
which means you have to examine the experience

663
00:31:15,866 --> 00:31:18,007
or else you cannot create an intuitive design.

664
00:31:18,248 --> 00:31:18,768
Okay, thank you.

665
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:19,548
My pleasure.

666
00:31:19,708 --> 00:31:20,049
This side.

667
00:31:21,169 --> 00:31:25,011
What's your feeling on interfaces becoming standard?

668
00:31:25,071 --> 00:31:26,892
So in a normal app development,

669
00:31:27,312 --> 00:31:29,133
things like the Apple tab bar is.

670
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:35,524
is a standard and in material design that sort of sets standards in games,

671
00:31:35,584 --> 00:31:40,207
how does that sort of translate in the sense that there's some pretty crazy menus out there,

672
00:31:40,227 --> 00:31:45,210
so things that are actually within a game world don't match a standard?

673
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,972
I think everything is incredibly contextual.

674
00:31:48,152 --> 00:31:51,834
So there, I ran into Dan Cook in the hall and he said he was talking to a guy

675
00:31:51,894 --> 00:31:56,337
who was literally making games harder because they only want hardcore gamers

676
00:31:56,477 --> 00:31:58,878
and they don't want ordinary people playing their games.

677
00:31:59,218 --> 00:32:05,984
I think there's an inherent classism built into our interface decisions, and that classism

678
00:32:06,104 --> 00:32:07,926
will reflect who's a real gamer.

679
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:12,610
and all those classical questions that are built into racism and sexism.

680
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:17,511
So I think that as gaming becomes ubiquitous,

681
00:32:17,931 --> 00:32:20,592
we have to ask ourselves, who are these people, what language do they speak,

682
00:32:20,912 --> 00:32:21,932
and who do we want to talk to?

683
00:32:21,952 --> 00:32:23,392
You don't want to default into your audience.

684
00:32:23,412 --> 00:32:24,353
You want to choose your audience.

685
00:32:24,413 --> 00:32:28,013
And I believe that if you like money, you'd like to have a rather large audience.

686
00:32:28,834 --> 00:32:31,734
The other thing is that gamers are already anchored at a certain price point,

687
00:32:32,115 --> 00:32:34,815
but you can move that price point around if you can get new audiences,

688
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:37,456
but that means you have to have the tolerance for onboarding them.

689
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:38,833
which is a huge problem.

690
00:32:39,213 --> 00:32:41,654
I'll always remember the moment when my daughter was watching Nickelodeon

691
00:32:41,674 --> 00:32:42,114
and she said,

692
00:32:42,154 --> 00:32:43,174
Mama, are you a gamer?

693
00:32:43,515 --> 00:32:43,995
And I was like,

694
00:32:45,475 --> 00:32:45,775
Yeah.

695
00:32:45,976 --> 00:32:46,336
And she goes,

696
00:32:46,696 --> 00:32:48,317
Yay! Can I be a gamer too?

697
00:32:48,477 --> 00:32:50,437
And I just, you know, that feeling.

698
00:32:50,818 --> 00:32:54,459
So I think that it is all our moral imperative to think about

699
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,200
how are we bringing more people into the games.

700
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,321
I hope that answered your question.

701
00:32:58,621 --> 00:33:03,203
Yeah, and also just games being the strange medium that they are.

702
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:06,584
A normal Apple, the interface is pretty standard.

703
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:07,871
across my system.

704
00:33:07,891 --> 00:33:09,752
Why should your menuing system not be standard?

705
00:33:09,832 --> 00:33:09,973
Yeah.

706
00:33:10,353 --> 00:33:11,834
There's no reason to be sexy in the menu.

707
00:33:11,854 --> 00:33:12,835
You can be sexy in the game.

708
00:33:12,995 --> 00:33:13,275
Yeah.

709
00:33:13,936 --> 00:33:14,836
Don't be sexy in the menu.

710
00:33:15,437 --> 00:33:15,657
Okay.

711
00:33:16,318 --> 00:33:16,478
Yes.

712
00:33:16,678 --> 00:33:17,298
One more question.

713
00:33:17,318 --> 00:33:18,179
Oh, well.

714
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,180
Sorry.

715
00:33:20,221 --> 00:33:20,521
My question...

716
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:21,822
And then I'll go to the wrap-up room.

717
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:29,808
My question is about what do you think about test interface before becoming 100% inside

718
00:33:29,828 --> 00:33:30,188
of the game?

719
00:33:31,689 --> 00:33:34,752
All you need is the level of fidelity so that your users understand it.

720
00:33:35,112 --> 00:33:36,673
So the question's always going to be...

721
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,771
How do I make sure that people can actually play with it?

722
00:33:40,791 --> 00:33:43,152
And the problem is that designers know too much.

723
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:47,736
So they'll recognize what some strange little symbol means and your users won't.

724
00:33:48,096 --> 00:33:49,257
So you have to pre-test it.

725
00:33:49,357 --> 00:33:52,499
Usually you want to find somebody else in a different part of the department,

726
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,781
HR, accounting, somebody like that.

727
00:33:55,141 --> 00:33:55,962
Do a quick test.

728
00:33:56,582 --> 00:34:01,026
Try to make it enough fidelity to be comprehensible, but no more than that.

729
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:03,207
Because the longer you spend making things...

730
00:34:04,223 --> 00:34:05,764
the more unwilling you are to change it.

731
00:34:05,784 --> 00:34:07,405
I don't know if you've heard of the IKEA effect.

732
00:34:07,465 --> 00:34:10,607
The IKEA effect says that the more effort we personally put

733
00:34:10,647 --> 00:34:12,989
into something, the more we value it and we'll overvalue it.

734
00:34:13,749 --> 00:34:15,050
That's why I don't let my students code.

735
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,892
You know, I want them to stay in paper because they're willing

736
00:34:17,932 --> 00:34:19,673
to rip things apart and toss it out.

737
00:34:20,233 --> 00:34:20,413
So.

738
00:34:21,834 --> 00:34:22,094
Thank you.

739
00:34:22,835 --> 00:34:24,776
Okay, we're off to the wrap-up room, right?

740
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:28,878
It's, that's, perhaps you can follow me

741
00:34:28,898 --> 00:34:29,699
and he'll tell me where it is.

742
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:29,819
Yes?

743
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,782
2022, we'll go to 2022.

744
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:37,989
I will be carrying more piles of books around, all GDC,

745
00:34:39,191 --> 00:34:41,495
so feel free to accost me tomorrow.

746
00:34:42,496 --> 00:34:45,160
I'll try to bring like 50 of them,

747
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,562
so please come find me.
