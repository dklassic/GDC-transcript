1
00:00:05,866 --> 00:00:08,807
for coming on a Friday, last day of GDC.

2
00:00:08,807 --> 00:00:10,228
My name is Mike Amender.

3
00:00:10,228 --> 00:00:12,529
I'm an experimental psychologist at Valve.

4
00:00:12,529 --> 00:00:13,649
I'll be speaking to you guys today

5
00:00:13,649 --> 00:00:15,370
about brain-computer interfaces

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,651
and why I think there might be one possible future

7
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:18,311
for how we play.

8
00:00:18,311 --> 00:00:23,453
So what does an experimental psychologist do at Valve?

9
00:00:23,453 --> 00:00:27,735
Basically this.

10
00:00:27,735 --> 00:00:28,635
So, maybe not.

11
00:00:28,635 --> 00:00:30,476
So I'm not on the clinical side.

12
00:00:30,476 --> 00:00:31,736
I'm on the research side of things.

13
00:00:33,438 --> 00:00:35,479
I show this picture because it gets a laugh,

14
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:38,821
makes people happy at the start of a presentation.

15
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:40,842
But I've been giving it, I use this picture at the start

16
00:00:40,842 --> 00:00:42,944
of basically every talk I've given

17
00:00:42,944 --> 00:00:44,405
for the last five or six years.

18
00:00:44,405 --> 00:00:46,506
And it reliably does get a laugh.

19
00:00:46,506 --> 00:00:49,068
And so I want you to think about that for a moment.

20
00:00:49,068 --> 00:00:51,349
What kinds of things could we do as gameplay designers

21
00:00:51,349 --> 00:00:53,290
if we could elicit reliable reactions?

22
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:56,672
Or if we could determine we were eliciting reliable reactions

23
00:00:56,672 --> 00:00:58,073
to various things our games were doing?

24
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,681
Think about the notion of reliably knowing

25
00:01:00,681 --> 00:01:02,782
that somebody is experiencing a particular sensation

26
00:01:02,782 --> 00:01:06,124
and how that might change how you design games

27
00:01:06,124 --> 00:01:09,786
and play games.

28
00:01:09,786 --> 00:01:12,588
So this is the question that motivated the talk.

29
00:01:12,588 --> 00:01:14,049
How would you interact with technology in 10 years?

30
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:16,090
What is the future of computing?

31
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,771
What is the future of gaming?

32
00:01:17,771 --> 00:01:19,352
What comes to mind when you think about

33
00:01:19,352 --> 00:01:21,813
consuming entertainment in the future?

34
00:01:21,813 --> 00:01:23,294
Is it mobile?

35
00:01:23,294 --> 00:01:23,854
Is it VR?

36
00:01:23,854 --> 00:01:24,034
Is it AR?

37
00:01:24,034 --> 00:01:25,875
Is it screens everywhere?

38
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:27,536
Is it something like Minority Report?

39
00:01:28,493 --> 00:01:29,935
Now, you know, we're in the vision track.

40
00:01:29,935 --> 00:01:32,337
This is, we're supposed to be speculative,

41
00:01:32,337 --> 00:01:33,078
to be forward-thinking.

42
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:35,800
And so what I'm about to cover is one possible direction

43
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,501
that things could go.

44
00:01:36,501 --> 00:01:40,104
So here's a quick overview of the talk.

45
00:01:40,104 --> 00:01:44,569
We'll go quickly through current generation interfaces,

46
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:45,950
and then I'll talk about three ways

47
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,092
that I think BCIs could significantly impact us

48
00:01:48,092 --> 00:01:49,053
as game designers.

49
00:01:49,702 --> 00:01:52,263
We'll talk about ways to improve playtesting.

50
00:01:52,263 --> 00:01:53,483
We'll talk about adaptive gameplay.

51
00:01:53,483 --> 00:01:56,504
And then we'll talk about what I guess I'm referring to

52
00:01:56,504 --> 00:01:59,464
as true BCI, but actually replacing current interfaces

53
00:01:59,464 --> 00:02:01,685
with interfaces that interpret your thoughts

54
00:02:01,685 --> 00:02:03,705
and translate them into something useful.

55
00:02:03,705 --> 00:02:05,566
And then we'll end with a discussion of the challenges,

56
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:09,887
the roadblocks, the things that might get in the way.

57
00:02:09,887 --> 00:02:11,307
So let's define BCIs.

58
00:02:12,112 --> 00:02:15,917
This is my definition, but you'll see similar definitions

59
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:16,798
kind of wherever you look.

60
00:02:16,798 --> 00:02:19,401
But basically, it's a communication pathway

61
00:02:19,401 --> 00:02:20,723
that transmits neuronal signals,

62
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,725
so things that are happening up here,

63
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,628
into actionable input for some external system.

64
00:02:24,628 --> 00:02:28,533
Could be a game, could be a screen, could be whatever.

65
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:34,241
I also want to make the broader point that while I'm going to describe, or most of the

66
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:39,043
talk will be about measuring neurological activity, truly what I'm talking about is

67
00:02:39,043 --> 00:02:43,745
acquiring physiological data from a player, right, and asking the question, is what changes

68
00:02:43,745 --> 00:02:47,747
when we can incorporate information about a player's internal state, what they're feeling,

69
00:02:47,747 --> 00:02:51,309
what they're sensing, what they're experiencing, what they're thinking, and incorporate that

70
00:02:51,309 --> 00:02:52,210
into our game designs.

71
00:02:53,138 --> 00:02:55,000
So again, while we're going to focus on information acquired

72
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,742
from the brain, there are other modalities and methodologies

73
00:02:57,742 --> 00:03:00,523
that will give us knowledge about a player's internal state,

74
00:03:00,523 --> 00:03:02,845
and we're going to cover them briefly.

75
00:03:02,845 --> 00:03:04,506
Another point to keep in mind is that in one respect,

76
00:03:04,506 --> 00:03:07,208
every interface is a brain-computer interface.

77
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,449
We're always translating our thoughts into a system response.

78
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:11,811
It's just mediated by a piece of hardware.

79
00:03:11,811 --> 00:03:15,113
So what differs is the medium through how we process

80
00:03:15,113 --> 00:03:16,874
the information that is an intent

81
00:03:16,874 --> 00:03:18,435
and turn it into something usable.

82
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,450
And so we might be able to accrue

83
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,391
a lot of the potential benefits I'm going to describe today

84
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:25,032
by not measuring brain signals directly.

85
00:03:25,032 --> 00:03:27,053
And what truly matters is having a reliable way

86
00:03:27,053 --> 00:03:30,495
of recording information about a player's cognition

87
00:03:30,495 --> 00:03:31,935
or emotion or experience.

88
00:03:31,935 --> 00:03:34,856
And so I'll describe other ways we could do this briefly,

89
00:03:34,856 --> 00:03:36,997
but really we're going to focus about

90
00:03:36,997 --> 00:03:38,238
brain-computer interface stuff today

91
00:03:38,238 --> 00:03:40,859
because I think in the long run,

92
00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:42,280
this will give us the most bang for our buck.

93
00:03:44,478 --> 00:03:46,819
So I'd like to kind of walk you guys through an analogy.

94
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:50,300
If you think about having a conversation with somebody,

95
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,760
there are both verbal and non-verbal parts

96
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,981
of the conversation, right?

97
00:03:52,981 --> 00:03:54,821
The verbal, the words that you say,

98
00:03:54,821 --> 00:03:55,801
and the non-verbal, right?

99
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:57,882
Like the change in somebody's tone of voice, right?

100
00:03:57,882 --> 00:03:59,242
If they're facing you or not.

101
00:03:59,242 --> 00:04:01,243
Their facial expressions, right?

102
00:04:01,243 --> 00:04:04,124
And when you get verbal and non-verbal information,

103
00:04:04,124 --> 00:04:07,785
you put them together, you get a complete conversation.

104
00:04:07,785 --> 00:04:10,185
And so I guess the point I would like to make

105
00:04:10,185 --> 00:04:12,466
is that right now with games, we have traditional inputs.

106
00:04:13,221 --> 00:04:15,002
But we might be missing the nonverbal part

107
00:04:15,002 --> 00:04:16,343
of the conversation, right?

108
00:04:16,343 --> 00:04:18,885
There might be other data that the player could be providing

109
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:22,067
to us as game designers that we're not acquiring.

110
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:24,468
And so what happens when we add in physiological data, right?

111
00:04:24,468 --> 00:04:27,290
Is it possible that we could make new kinds of games?

112
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,431
We're going to spend the next few minutes

113
00:04:29,431 --> 00:04:31,072
trying to convince you guys that yes, it is.

114
00:04:31,072 --> 00:04:33,714
And I think this will be a useful analogy,

115
00:04:33,714 --> 00:04:35,655
a useful framework to keep in mind for the rest of the talk.

116
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:40,320
So let's talk about current generation interfaces.

117
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,361
You know, broadly speaking,

118
00:04:41,361 --> 00:04:42,643
you're transforming some intent.

119
00:04:42,643 --> 00:04:45,125
I want to jump, I want to aim to the left,

120
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:48,168
I want to move forward, I want to reload.

121
00:04:48,168 --> 00:04:50,490
Can you combine it with current generation control,

122
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,412
a mouse, a keyboard, and so forth.

123
00:04:52,412 --> 00:04:54,394
And it turns into an onscreen action.

124
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,955
And so let's briefly cover what we can do

125
00:04:55,955 --> 00:04:57,577
with current generation technology.

126
00:04:57,577 --> 00:05:00,580
All right, mouse and keyboard, this is actually my.

127
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,620
my keyboard, my mouse.

128
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,400
With a mouse you get a one-to-one mapping

129
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,481
of hand and wrist location to a location on screen.

130
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:07,221
You can shift directions.

131
00:05:07,221 --> 00:05:08,961
You have button presses as well.

132
00:05:08,961 --> 00:05:12,362
Keyboards transform keyboard presses and on-screen actions.

133
00:05:12,362 --> 00:05:15,163
You can navigate with WASD.

134
00:05:15,163 --> 00:05:18,643
You're limited in the number of things you can do

135
00:05:18,643 --> 00:05:21,204
by the number of keys, but also by player memory.

136
00:05:21,204 --> 00:05:23,284
Keyboards could give you, with combinations of keys,

137
00:05:23,284 --> 00:05:24,804
thousands and maybe even tens of thousands

138
00:05:24,804 --> 00:05:26,645
of possible inputs.

139
00:05:26,645 --> 00:05:28,625
Humans can't remember that many.

140
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:29,145
Not to play a game.

141
00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:34,287
So memory is actually a fundamental limitation here.

142
00:05:34,287 --> 00:05:36,808
So how many possible combinations do you think

143
00:05:36,808 --> 00:05:39,189
you can remember off the top of your head

144
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:40,990
when you're playing a game? 10, 50, 100?

145
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,611
There is a limitation.

146
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:44,432
And so a question to think about is

147
00:05:44,432 --> 00:05:46,312
what if you didn't have to remember everything?

148
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:48,453
What if you could just think about

149
00:05:48,453 --> 00:05:49,454
what you wanted to do and it happened?

150
00:05:49,454 --> 00:05:50,774
Would that change how you play games?

151
00:05:50,774 --> 00:05:54,136
So the gamepad.

152
00:05:54,842 --> 00:05:56,983
I work for Valve, so this is the Steam controller.

153
00:05:56,983 --> 00:06:00,826
There are also lots of other great game fads out there.

154
00:06:00,826 --> 00:06:02,547
Again, we have buttons that mimic

155
00:06:02,547 --> 00:06:04,168
kind of what we get from keyboards,

156
00:06:04,168 --> 00:06:06,049
and we have analog sticks and touchpads

157
00:06:06,049 --> 00:06:08,411
to mimic what we get from a mouse.

158
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:10,272
Analog sticks, instead of being one-to-one mapping,

159
00:06:10,272 --> 00:06:11,833
give you a velocity vector, right?

160
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:14,314
You get a direction and a displacement,

161
00:06:14,314 --> 00:06:18,117
and you have D-pads for more binary actions.

162
00:06:18,117 --> 00:06:19,378
We also have gestural controls.

163
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:24,703
Things that let you make more naturalistic movements.

164
00:06:24,703 --> 00:06:25,023
Wii Boxing.

165
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,984
You can actually box.

166
00:06:26,984 --> 00:06:28,844
So you get a wider array of possible movements

167
00:06:28,844 --> 00:06:31,846
and more naturalistic, which is kind of intuitive to,

168
00:06:31,846 --> 00:06:33,966
I guess, would be a useful memory cue.

169
00:06:33,966 --> 00:06:37,048
It's also fatiguing.

170
00:06:37,048 --> 00:06:39,209
Moving your hand and your wrist is not as tiring

171
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:40,409
as moving your entire arm.

172
00:06:43,442 --> 00:06:45,543
A quick summary of what we just discussed.

173
00:06:45,543 --> 00:06:48,824
Again, we're mapping intent to onscreen output.

174
00:06:48,824 --> 00:06:51,566
We're doing it with reasonable latency.

175
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:52,706
You have to think a thought and translate it

176
00:06:52,706 --> 00:06:54,887
into a finger movement or a hand movement

177
00:06:54,887 --> 00:06:57,048
or a wrist movement.

178
00:06:57,048 --> 00:06:58,188
We have restricted bandwidth.

179
00:06:58,188 --> 00:06:59,489
We can only do so much at once.

180
00:06:59,489 --> 00:07:02,890
How many different keys can you press at once?

181
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,131
We're starting to add a widening array of input patterns

182
00:07:05,131 --> 00:07:07,752
and we are getting more naturalistic movements.

183
00:07:07,752 --> 00:07:09,513
And these are great.

184
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:11,754
They work for current generation games and that's fine.

185
00:07:12,555 --> 00:07:15,017
But I guess the question I'd like to ask you guys is,

186
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:18,759
what happens if we didn't have to use them?

187
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:20,561
How would you imagine an ideal interface?

188
00:07:20,561 --> 00:07:24,183
Like, think about ways to improve current interfaces,

189
00:07:24,183 --> 00:07:27,746
or what new kinds of interfaces might be.

190
00:07:27,746 --> 00:07:29,287
What are better ways of interacting with games

191
00:07:29,287 --> 00:07:30,448
and pieces of technology, right?

192
00:07:30,448 --> 00:07:31,809
Are we yet optimal?

193
00:07:31,809 --> 00:07:32,149
Is this it?

194
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:33,290
Or can we do better?

195
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,552
What is your end game for an interface?

196
00:07:35,552 --> 00:07:37,033
What is your dream interface?

197
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:38,594
Like, what are ways things could be improved?

198
00:07:40,998 --> 00:07:43,880
So if you couldn't come up with anything

199
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,742
in like the eight seconds I gave you to think of stuff,

200
00:07:47,742 --> 00:07:48,242
I made my own list.

201
00:07:48,242 --> 00:07:49,883
So interfaces could respond quicker.

202
00:07:49,883 --> 00:07:51,904
They could allow a much broader space

203
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,825
of possible input commands.

204
00:07:53,825 --> 00:07:55,406
We could have complex patterns of input.

205
00:07:55,406 --> 00:07:57,207
We could have chains.

206
00:07:57,207 --> 00:07:57,988
Think about doing thing,

207
00:07:57,988 --> 00:07:59,408
oh I wanna undo the last thing I did

208
00:07:59,408 --> 00:08:01,029
and rotate this thing that I did and whatnot.

209
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:05,151
We could also maybe get additional axes of information

210
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:05,892
from the player.

211
00:08:05,892 --> 00:08:07,152
And so I wanna drill into this one.

212
00:08:07,152 --> 00:08:08,993
And this is going to be the focus of the talk.

213
00:08:11,611 --> 00:08:14,693
With BCIs we can make progress on all of the,

214
00:08:14,693 --> 00:08:19,397
I guess, the top four ways we can potentially improve

215
00:08:19,397 --> 00:08:22,279
interfaces, but what I'm really curious about,

216
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,940
or what I'm really fascinated by,

217
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,802
is what happens when we get additional data

218
00:08:25,802 --> 00:08:27,603
from the player we're not getting

219
00:08:27,603 --> 00:08:28,804
with current generation interfaces?

220
00:08:28,804 --> 00:08:31,866
So what could we do if we had more,

221
00:08:31,866 --> 00:08:34,228
or different kinds of information from the player?

222
00:08:34,228 --> 00:08:36,970
This is the question, this is the question

223
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,371
that kind of motivates this research.

224
00:08:38,371 --> 00:08:40,192
What about all the data we're missing

225
00:08:40,192 --> 00:08:41,353
from the player's experience?

226
00:08:41,911 --> 00:08:44,232
We know what players are trying to do in game

227
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,272
for the most part.

228
00:08:45,272 --> 00:08:47,673
We know if they're jumping or reloading

229
00:08:47,673 --> 00:08:50,554
or selecting a character, right?

230
00:08:50,554 --> 00:08:51,795
Or trying to attack.

231
00:08:51,795 --> 00:08:55,216
But we don't know how they're experiencing it.

232
00:08:55,216 --> 00:08:56,657
So are they happy or are they sad?

233
00:08:56,657 --> 00:08:59,778
Are they engaged or are they detached?

234
00:08:59,778 --> 00:09:02,179
Are they challenged or are they bored?

235
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:04,159
Are they frustrated or curious?

236
00:09:04,867 --> 00:09:07,088
Are they exploring or solving puzzles or goofing off

237
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:07,868
or playing seriously?

238
00:09:07,868 --> 00:09:10,069
Are they learning something new?

239
00:09:10,069 --> 00:09:11,190
Are they learning something old?

240
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,030
Are they distracted?

241
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,111
Are they remembering something?

242
00:09:14,111 --> 00:09:16,052
Are they speaking to a friend?

243
00:09:16,052 --> 00:09:17,292
Are they getting angrier?

244
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:18,213
Are they getting happier?

245
00:09:18,213 --> 00:09:19,793
Right, so do we actually need any of this?

246
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:22,694
You know, maybe not, but I would like to find out.

247
00:09:22,694 --> 00:09:24,455
I guess like a hypothesis I'm going to make in this talk

248
00:09:24,455 --> 00:09:26,996
is that we would get an improved player experience

249
00:09:26,996 --> 00:09:28,997
and a qualitatively different player experience.

250
00:09:29,692 --> 00:09:31,673
if we had access to internal states and emotions

251
00:09:31,673 --> 00:09:33,174
and cognitions and decisions.

252
00:09:33,174 --> 00:09:34,615
And so I hope at the end of this talk,

253
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,536
you can kind of see at least why I believe this

254
00:09:36,536 --> 00:09:40,838
and maybe you might feel similarly.

255
00:09:40,838 --> 00:09:43,080
Okay, so let's get to the good stuff.

256
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,361
Here's a picture of me wearing my sweet

257
00:09:45,361 --> 00:09:47,162
OpenBCI EEG headset.

258
00:09:47,162 --> 00:09:49,604
It's an open source company.

259
00:09:49,604 --> 00:09:51,045
There are other EEG headsets that look

260
00:09:51,045 --> 00:09:52,706
a little bit different, but I kind of like this one

261
00:09:52,706 --> 00:09:55,107
because it always makes people ask me what I'm doing

262
00:09:55,107 --> 00:09:56,348
when they see me wearing it.

263
00:09:56,348 --> 00:09:58,849
So again, broadly speaking.

264
00:09:59,826 --> 00:10:02,426
A BCI, or at least as I'm using it here,

265
00:10:02,426 --> 00:10:04,927
is a way of transforming what happens up here

266
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,227
into something usable for a system out here.

267
00:10:07,227 --> 00:10:10,068
So we wanna interpret physiological data

268
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,568
and turn it into something useful.

269
00:10:12,568 --> 00:10:14,509
And so, well again, I am referring directly

270
00:10:14,509 --> 00:10:16,069
to measuring neurological signals.

271
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:19,070
Again, truly any way we could reliably detect

272
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:22,330
emotions or decisions or intents or thoughts

273
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,051
could fall kind of like under the space

274
00:10:24,051 --> 00:10:26,131
or under the, I guess, well, could be used

275
00:10:26,131 --> 00:10:27,952
for what I'm about to start describing.

276
00:10:30,138 --> 00:10:31,898
So this is a cool looking picture of a neuron.

277
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:33,679
You guys might remember neurons

278
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:34,679
from your eighth grade biology textbook.

279
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:38,180
Neurons are nerve cells.

280
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,581
They are the atomic units of the brain.

281
00:10:39,581 --> 00:10:41,902
I promise this is the only, I think,

282
00:10:41,902 --> 00:10:42,902
biology slide in the talk.

283
00:10:42,902 --> 00:10:45,543
Yeah, so neurons are the atomic units of the brain.

284
00:10:45,543 --> 00:10:47,443
If you put enough of them together

285
00:10:47,443 --> 00:10:49,644
and you organize them in various functional

286
00:10:49,644 --> 00:10:52,005
and hierarchical ways, you get a brain.

287
00:10:52,005 --> 00:10:54,946
And so they communicate by firing or not firing.

288
00:10:55,703 --> 00:10:59,026
They send electrical signals down various pathways

289
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:01,507
of processing, and they're clustered together

290
00:11:01,507 --> 00:11:02,828
in various brain regions and seem

291
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:06,030
to provide distinct subsets of functionality,

292
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:06,830
although not always.

293
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,692
There are about 100 billion in the brain,

294
00:11:08,692 --> 00:11:11,473
and connections between neurons is called a synapse.

295
00:11:11,473 --> 00:11:14,335
There are about 1,000 trillion, or one quadrillion,

296
00:11:14,335 --> 00:11:17,637
synaptic connections in a human brain.

297
00:11:17,637 --> 00:11:20,139
And when neurons fire, and this is the important part,

298
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,621
They produce every single aspect

299
00:11:23,621 --> 00:11:25,762
of conscious and unconscious experience.

300
00:11:25,762 --> 00:11:28,183
Every thought you have, every sensation you have,

301
00:11:28,183 --> 00:11:30,363
everything you perceive, every feeling you have.

302
00:11:30,363 --> 00:11:33,665
They're a consequence of neurons,

303
00:11:33,665 --> 00:11:36,285
or bundles of neurons, or patterns of neurons

304
00:11:36,285 --> 00:11:37,946
firing together, or not firing.

305
00:11:37,946 --> 00:11:44,188
So in some respects, we're actually already inside

306
00:11:44,188 --> 00:11:47,009
the matrix, like what we see and experience and feel

307
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:50,470
is constructed by neurons firing up here.

308
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:53,344
And when you have a thought, neurons fire in a particular way.

309
00:11:53,344 --> 00:11:57,007
When you have a different thought, neurons fire in a different way.

310
00:11:57,007 --> 00:12:00,630
There is a neurological correlate or origin for every single thing that happens in our

311
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,531
brain.

312
00:12:01,531 --> 00:12:04,493
And our reality is constructed by these patterns of firings.

313
00:12:04,493 --> 00:12:07,976
So if we can reliably measure them, then maybe we can start doing useful things with them.

314
00:12:10,216 --> 00:12:12,118
So just to drill into that a little bit deeper,

315
00:12:12,118 --> 00:12:13,299
what are we actually measuring?

316
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:14,901
Patterns of activity in the brain,

317
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,863
whether they are temporal, so happening over time,

318
00:12:16,863 --> 00:12:18,905
or spatial, where they are happening in the brain.

319
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:22,228
And we're also measuring responses to external stimuli,

320
00:12:22,228 --> 00:12:24,991
what I see and hear and feel and touch,

321
00:12:24,991 --> 00:12:27,774
or imagined, what I'm thinking, right?

322
00:12:27,774 --> 00:12:30,177
All of these will produce,

323
00:12:30,177 --> 00:12:31,858
you know, all of these will induce neurons to fire.

324
00:12:34,117 --> 00:12:37,198
So what we're actually recording is firing rates of neurons

325
00:12:37,198 --> 00:12:38,758
or firing rates of systems of neurons

326
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,639
or blood flow to areas where neurons fire.

327
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:43,920
We simply want to understand locations

328
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,480
of increased levels of activity in the brain

329
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,001
and hopefully what they are.

330
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:51,302
And if we can take these patterns of activity

331
00:12:51,302 --> 00:12:52,862
and describe them in terms of something

332
00:12:52,862 --> 00:12:57,804
a player is experiencing, that's the trick.

333
00:12:57,804 --> 00:13:00,665
We need to say, okay, this pattern of electrical impulses

334
00:13:00,665 --> 00:13:03,245
means happiness or it means sadness.

335
00:13:04,486 --> 00:13:06,007
or it means I wish I had reloaded

336
00:13:06,007 --> 00:13:07,208
a fraction of a second earlier,

337
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:11,370
or I see somebody doing something cool in a game

338
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:15,553
and I wish I knew how to do that.

339
00:13:15,553 --> 00:13:18,015
So how do we measure this?

340
00:13:18,015 --> 00:13:19,255
The sweet BCI headset, or EEG headset,

341
00:13:19,255 --> 00:13:22,978
is on the lower left, it's an EEG.

342
00:13:22,978 --> 00:13:26,480
I'm gonna, everything that has an acronym,

343
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,160
I'm gonna try and say,

344
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,761
although I think I'm gonna mispronounce them

345
00:13:28,761 --> 00:13:31,423
so you guys can laugh at me if I do.

346
00:13:31,423 --> 00:13:33,124
EEGs are electroencephalograms, look at that.

347
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:37,025
They measure electroactivity in the brain.

348
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,906
The one in the middle is FNIRS,

349
00:13:38,906 --> 00:13:40,866
it's Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy.

350
00:13:40,866 --> 00:13:43,087
It measures light scattering of blood flow,

351
00:13:43,087 --> 00:13:44,047
and then you have fMRI,

352
00:13:44,047 --> 00:13:46,227
Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

353
00:13:46,227 --> 00:13:48,288
Also measures blood flow,

354
00:13:48,288 --> 00:13:49,748
or essentially oxidated blood flow.

355
00:13:49,748 --> 00:13:51,409
And these are ways of detecting,

356
00:13:51,409 --> 00:13:52,909
essentially just neurons firing.

357
00:13:54,872 --> 00:13:57,995
I alluded to other physiological signals we could measure.

358
00:13:57,995 --> 00:13:59,897
Heart rate, galvanic skin response,

359
00:13:59,897 --> 00:14:03,400
essentially is a change in the pH composition of your sweat

360
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,062
that's correlated with physiological arousal.

361
00:14:05,062 --> 00:14:07,184
Pretty reliable, pretty useful.

362
00:14:07,184 --> 00:14:08,785
Eye tracking, we can see where you're looking

363
00:14:08,785 --> 00:14:10,807
in our display, get an index of attention.

364
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,381
We have facial expressions which indicate emotion.

365
00:14:13,381 --> 00:14:16,743
We have muscle tension, which is an EMG electromyography

366
00:14:16,743 --> 00:14:19,144
sensor that can also kind of give you insight

367
00:14:19,144 --> 00:14:20,385
into a player's emotion.

368
00:14:20,385 --> 00:14:23,727
And then you have posture, which could give you guys

369
00:14:23,727 --> 00:14:25,668
social cues and perhaps measures of engagement as well.

370
00:14:25,668 --> 00:14:28,150
All of these might be useful and all of these

371
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,591
might get us a long way towards kind of like

372
00:14:30,591 --> 00:14:31,772
the things I'm about to describe.

373
00:14:31,772 --> 00:14:34,974
But we are gonna stick with BCIs

374
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:38,016
and I guess that's the last time I'll give you guys

375
00:14:38,016 --> 00:14:38,616
that caveat.

376
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:41,670
So I've also been talking primarily

377
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,951
about the central nervous system,

378
00:14:42,951 --> 00:14:45,612
which refers to what's happening up here in your brain.

379
00:14:45,612 --> 00:14:47,714
We also have a peripheral nervous system, right?

380
00:14:47,714 --> 00:14:50,015
We have nerve cells that go to our fingers,

381
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:53,117
go to our fingertips, and reach down to our toes.

382
00:14:53,117 --> 00:14:55,638
People have different estimations

383
00:14:55,638 --> 00:14:57,079
of how long it takes a signal to travel

384
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:58,280
from your brain to your finger.

385
00:14:59,017 --> 00:15:01,239
One number to use could be 100 milliseconds.

386
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:04,201
What if you could intercept the signal right here

387
00:15:04,201 --> 00:15:06,943
at the wrist and say, yeah, we know that you,

388
00:15:06,943 --> 00:15:09,425
means you want to turn your hand this way,

389
00:15:09,425 --> 00:15:10,727
move the mouse this way.

390
00:15:10,727 --> 00:15:12,428
What if we could shave off 10 milliseconds

391
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:14,029
or 20 milliseconds or even 30 milliseconds

392
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:15,891
off of your reaction time?

393
00:15:15,891 --> 00:15:18,153
You think people who play games competitively

394
00:15:18,153 --> 00:15:19,554
would want that.

395
00:15:19,554 --> 00:15:22,076
What if we could predict your movement before you made it?

396
00:15:22,076 --> 00:15:23,838
Would that be interesting?

397
00:15:23,838 --> 00:15:25,860
There are people working on this right now.

398
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,620
Seems possible.

399
00:15:29,408 --> 00:15:31,330
Another interesting thing to think about with BCIs

400
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,671
is I've been talking mainly about

401
00:15:32,671 --> 00:15:34,913
the read side of the equation.

402
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:36,534
What about the write side of the equation?

403
00:15:36,534 --> 00:15:37,896
What about inducing?

404
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:40,418
So the read side is interpreting brain signals.

405
00:15:40,418 --> 00:15:43,700
What about inducing them or creating them?

406
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,103
This already happens with perception and cognition.

407
00:15:46,103 --> 00:15:48,064
When games show you something,

408
00:15:48,064 --> 00:15:49,726
they're inducing patterns of neuronal activity.

409
00:15:49,726 --> 00:15:51,667
When they make you think something,

410
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:53,689
they're inducing patterns of neuronal activity.

411
00:15:53,689 --> 00:15:55,350
You can also do that directly.

412
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,771
People are investigating this now.

413
00:15:59,386 --> 00:16:04,128
This next slide might be the most important distinction to think about when we're discussing

414
00:16:04,128 --> 00:16:04,228
BCIs.

415
00:16:04,228 --> 00:16:10,310
You can create interfaces that communicate non-invasively, outside the brain, and you

416
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:15,652
can create interfaces that communicate invasively, from inside the brain, or from underneath

417
00:16:15,652 --> 00:16:16,733
the skull, from inside the skull.

418
00:16:19,153 --> 00:16:20,353
Lots of things we can do.

419
00:16:20,353 --> 00:16:22,534
We can do non-invasively.

420
00:16:22,534 --> 00:16:26,076
EEGs, electroencephalogram, MEGs, magnetoencephalogram.

421
00:16:26,076 --> 00:16:29,277
But we can also go invasively with electrocorticography

422
00:16:29,277 --> 00:16:31,558
or stereo electroencephalograms.

423
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:33,839
A lot of the things we're going to discuss again,

424
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,120
we can do non-invasively.

425
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,601
But some of the things I'm going to describe,

426
00:16:38,601 --> 00:16:41,782
we might only be able to do invasively.

427
00:16:41,782 --> 00:16:44,924
How many of us are willing to have somebody

428
00:16:44,924 --> 00:16:47,245
drill a hole in our head to derive a benefit?

429
00:16:48,181 --> 00:16:51,962
Maybe not too many, but in the future, who knows?

430
00:16:51,962 --> 00:16:56,524
We're gonna discuss why people might be willing to do that.

431
00:16:56,524 --> 00:16:57,324
So here's EEG data.

432
00:16:57,324 --> 00:17:00,045
This is actual data we can turn into something useful.

433
00:17:00,045 --> 00:17:03,627
This is from the very first recording I ever made.

434
00:17:03,627 --> 00:17:05,927
This is my brainwaves.

435
00:17:05,927 --> 00:17:07,968
You can see that electrode number eight

436
00:17:07,968 --> 00:17:10,169
was not seated correctly, so we'll never truly know.

437
00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:13,231
what I was thinking at this point in time.

438
00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:16,154
But the trick here is to turn this into something useful.

439
00:17:16,154 --> 00:17:18,556
So this is data recorded over time.

440
00:17:18,556 --> 00:17:20,877
One way, and I won't have too much analysis slides in here,

441
00:17:20,877 --> 00:17:22,759
but I do want to kind of give you guys some insight

442
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:24,921
into what you can do, is just look at, essentially,

443
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:27,583
the firing rates of electrical activity

444
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:30,746
in various parts of the brain, and you can categorize them.

445
00:17:30,746 --> 00:17:32,547
Delta waves are slow, and beta waves are quick.

446
00:17:32,547 --> 00:17:34,288
And you can see where you get more or less of them

447
00:17:34,288 --> 00:17:36,070
in various parts of the brain.

448
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,152
And so you can take these patterns of activity,

449
00:17:38,152 --> 00:17:39,973
and again, if you reliably measure them.

450
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,340
you can turn them into something that says,

451
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,842
yeah, a player is feeling this,

452
00:17:44,842 --> 00:17:47,583
or is thinking this, or is intending this.

453
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,784
There are lots of signal processing techniques to do this,

454
00:17:49,784 --> 00:17:51,825
machine learning and deep learning techniques

455
00:17:51,825 --> 00:17:53,006
are very useful in this space

456
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:55,867
because we're dealing with noisy data.

457
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,248
And a lot of work needs to be done,

458
00:17:57,248 --> 00:17:59,229
but this is one way that people kind of

459
00:17:59,229 --> 00:18:00,309
try and make sense of what's happening.

460
00:18:00,309 --> 00:18:04,131
So with BCIS, what can we actually measure today

461
00:18:04,131 --> 00:18:06,312
and measure non-invasively?

462
00:18:06,312 --> 00:18:09,614
These are just headlines from journal articles.

463
00:18:09,614 --> 00:18:10,675
Here's an incomplete list.

464
00:18:11,807 --> 00:18:13,068
We could measure someone's learning,

465
00:18:13,068 --> 00:18:14,789
if they're learning something,

466
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:16,351
and their ability or faculty to learn.

467
00:18:16,351 --> 00:18:20,013
We could measure surprise or novelty.

468
00:18:20,013 --> 00:18:22,615
We could measure if they're excited or relaxed.

469
00:18:22,615 --> 00:18:25,857
We could measure affect,

470
00:18:25,857 --> 00:18:27,679
which is just what psychologists refer to

471
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:28,860
as kind of the direction of emotion,

472
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,121
whether it's positive or negative.

473
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:32,002
We could measure whether they're,

474
00:18:32,002 --> 00:18:33,563
if they're attending to something,

475
00:18:33,563 --> 00:18:35,384
or if they're engaged, if they're bored.

476
00:18:35,384 --> 00:18:38,727
We could measure responses to in-game stimuli.

477
00:18:39,857 --> 00:18:42,257
And we're not always getting these signals reliably,

478
00:18:42,257 --> 00:18:44,738
but we're starting to figure out how.

479
00:18:44,738 --> 00:18:46,159
So just think about what you would want to know

480
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:47,939
about your players.

481
00:18:47,939 --> 00:18:50,000
There is a long list of things that we can get right now

482
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,080
with current generation technology,

483
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:52,921
current generation analysis,

484
00:18:52,921 --> 00:18:55,762
and current generation experimentation.

485
00:18:59,384 --> 00:19:00,765
So I guess I'm gonna make the case

486
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:04,266
that there is increasing BCI interest these days.

487
00:19:04,266 --> 00:19:05,487
And the reasons for that would be

488
00:19:05,487 --> 00:19:07,468
we're getting better at imaging, detecting data,

489
00:19:07,468 --> 00:19:09,629
also at stimulating, which is the red side of the equation,

490
00:19:09,629 --> 00:19:11,270
and also the analysis,

491
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,771
like deep learning is very helpful here.

492
00:19:12,771 --> 00:19:15,212
Also, we're figuring out ways

493
00:19:15,212 --> 00:19:17,173
to aid people with disabilities,

494
00:19:17,173 --> 00:19:19,214
people with sensory impairments or motor impairments

495
00:19:19,214 --> 00:19:22,215
or cognitive impairments.

496
00:19:22,215 --> 00:19:25,137
We're getting the ability to, yeah.

497
00:19:25,908 --> 00:19:27,869
Help people see again, who can't see,

498
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:29,990
and hear again, who can't hear.

499
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,951
And manipulate things again, if they've lost a limb

500
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:33,651
or if they're paralyzed.

501
00:19:33,651 --> 00:19:36,312
There's also fears about general AI.

502
00:19:36,312 --> 00:19:38,673
People have those concerns and they'd like to figure out

503
00:19:38,673 --> 00:19:40,633
how humans can compete, and so they're looking at BCIs.

504
00:19:40,633 --> 00:19:43,154
And people have a general interest

505
00:19:43,154 --> 00:19:45,255
in augmenting human capability.

506
00:19:45,255 --> 00:19:48,136
Can we push ourselves past what we already are now?

507
00:19:48,136 --> 00:19:50,397
Gets a little hairy, but again, it is driving interest.

508
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:53,238
There's also one more factor that was kind of important.

509
00:19:54,677 --> 00:19:56,778
is that if you're gonna measure brain signals,

510
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:59,660
you need a way to get people to wear a helmet.

511
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,761
So if only we, us as game designers,

512
00:20:00,761 --> 00:20:03,342
had a way of doing that.

513
00:20:03,342 --> 00:20:04,963
Well, you know, not everybody plays VR,

514
00:20:04,963 --> 00:20:06,804
but one advantage that the VR and AR

515
00:20:06,804 --> 00:20:08,785
potentially have as well is you're getting

516
00:20:08,785 --> 00:20:11,126
consistent contact, or at least semi-consistent contact

517
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:14,808
with the source of brain activity.

518
00:20:14,808 --> 00:20:16,349
So you might be able to do interesting things

519
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:18,450
if you could convince people to wear a helmet

520
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,451
that had EEG sensors.

521
00:20:24,478 --> 00:20:26,460
All right, so let's get to the interesting stuff.

522
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,241
That was an overview.

523
00:20:27,241 --> 00:20:28,882
I wanted to get everybody on the same page

524
00:20:28,882 --> 00:20:31,125
just so people kind of understood what I was talking about.

525
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,947
What I'm gonna talk about for the remainder of the talk,

526
00:20:33,947 --> 00:20:35,368
I'm gonna talk about, I guess,

527
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:38,131
three separate areas of interest.

528
00:20:38,131 --> 00:20:41,094
How BCIs could change the way that we design games

529
00:20:41,094 --> 00:20:42,735
and play games and our players play games.

530
00:20:44,228 --> 00:20:45,649
So we'll start with playtesting improvements,

531
00:20:45,649 --> 00:20:47,651
then we'll move on to adaptive gameplay,

532
00:20:47,651 --> 00:20:50,012
and then we'll talk about the end game,

533
00:20:50,012 --> 00:20:52,734
actually replacing interfaces.

534
00:20:52,734 --> 00:20:55,236
Playtesting and adaptive gameplay can be done now,

535
00:20:55,236 --> 00:20:59,059
the interface replacements will be in the future,

536
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:02,341
but in some cases are actually starting now.

537
00:21:02,341 --> 00:21:03,482
So we'll begin with playtesting.

538
00:21:03,482 --> 00:21:07,525
This is an example of a test subject playing Team Fortress.

539
00:21:07,525 --> 00:21:08,806
So playtesting is how...

540
00:21:09,544 --> 00:21:10,845
It's how Valve makes our games.

541
00:21:10,845 --> 00:21:12,866
We gather data from people who are not us

542
00:21:12,866 --> 00:21:15,348
and then iterate and improve the game as a consequence.

543
00:21:15,348 --> 00:21:19,090
I imagine it's how lots of people make games.

544
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,491
Playtesting is great.

545
00:21:20,491 --> 00:21:22,472
Here are a few traditional approaches.

546
00:21:22,472 --> 00:21:24,293
Direct observation or watching somebody play the game.

547
00:21:24,293 --> 00:21:26,114
You can ask people questions afterwards,

548
00:21:26,114 --> 00:21:28,216
or sometimes during.

549
00:21:28,216 --> 00:21:29,897
You can give people surveys.

550
00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:32,678
Game metrics are how we test on the player base at large.

551
00:21:32,678 --> 00:21:33,999
Look at some measurable human behavior.

552
00:21:33,999 --> 00:21:36,861
And also doing usability to poke at specific aspects

553
00:21:36,861 --> 00:21:37,782
of what's happening.

554
00:21:40,193 --> 00:21:43,315
Playlisting is great, there are downsides.

555
00:21:43,315 --> 00:21:45,276
If you ask people questions, they rationalize,

556
00:21:45,276 --> 00:21:47,817
they invent, they confabulate and conflate,

557
00:21:47,817 --> 00:21:48,617
and they forget things.

558
00:21:48,617 --> 00:21:51,739
Can also only measure what we record, right?

559
00:21:51,739 --> 00:21:52,979
Any behavior we're not recording,

560
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,800
we don't know if it's happening.

561
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,980
And it can be hard to know why sometimes.

562
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,182
As a psychologist, I'm happy to walk you guys

563
00:21:59,182 --> 00:22:01,563
through all the ways that people don't understand

564
00:22:01,563 --> 00:22:04,924
why they do what they do, but that's a separate talk.

565
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:06,525
We also lack moment-to-moment insight.

566
00:22:07,295 --> 00:22:08,616
about what a player is experiencing.

567
00:22:08,616 --> 00:22:10,037
They can tell you in the moment,

568
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,518
but that changes the experience.

569
00:22:11,518 --> 00:22:12,740
They can't tell you everything.

570
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:17,224
And large sample sizes are impractical.

571
00:22:17,224 --> 00:22:18,765
We can bring in 30 people a week,

572
00:22:18,765 --> 00:22:21,207
maybe 100 people a week.

573
00:22:21,207 --> 00:22:24,290
What if we could play this on 300,000 people a week,

574
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:24,991
or three million?

575
00:22:24,991 --> 00:22:30,796
Would we become better game designers?

576
00:22:30,796 --> 00:22:32,958
So let's walk through six specific ways

577
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:34,299
that BCIs could be interesting.

578
00:22:35,628 --> 00:22:37,528
how they might help us get moment-to-moment insight

579
00:22:37,528 --> 00:22:39,129
to what our player is experiencing,

580
00:22:39,129 --> 00:22:41,910
how we might get more objective data and do it at scale,

581
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:44,071
the new kinds of data we can get,

582
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,491
how we can measure things over time,

583
00:22:45,491 --> 00:22:48,292
and then how it becomes, I guess,

584
00:22:48,292 --> 00:22:50,613
a source of, a way of giving us more confidence

585
00:22:50,613 --> 00:22:51,813
as we can let it kind of work

586
00:22:51,813 --> 00:22:54,254
with other methodologies we currently have.

587
00:22:54,254 --> 00:22:59,096
So moment-to-moment insight.

588
00:22:59,096 --> 00:23:02,157
To me, this is the thing that, I guess,

589
00:23:02,157 --> 00:23:03,897
most excites me, I guess, at the moment.

590
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,966
because we can do this right now

591
00:23:06,966 --> 00:23:09,126
and get data we haven't had before.

592
00:23:09,126 --> 00:23:10,566
We can get a real-time understanding

593
00:23:10,566 --> 00:23:11,987
of a player's emotional state,

594
00:23:11,987 --> 00:23:13,847
moment by moment, second by second.

595
00:23:13,847 --> 00:23:16,547
We can start figuring out responses

596
00:23:16,547 --> 00:23:17,768
to individual components of gameplay.

597
00:23:17,768 --> 00:23:19,268
So think about that for a second.

598
00:23:19,268 --> 00:23:22,928
You can understand how a player reacts

599
00:23:22,928 --> 00:23:24,809
to a specific enemy or a chat message

600
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:26,509
or a bullet that's fired, or if they die,

601
00:23:26,509 --> 00:23:30,930
or if they kill a character, if they choose a character,

602
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:33,990
or if they see a piece of the environment they like.

603
00:23:35,051 --> 00:23:38,213
We can eliminate gross responses, like, oh, I like this.

604
00:23:38,213 --> 00:23:39,214
Yeah, the game was five out of 10,

605
00:23:39,214 --> 00:23:41,556
or it was great, or it wasn't.

606
00:23:41,556 --> 00:23:43,898
We can determine the components of a player's experience

607
00:23:43,898 --> 00:23:46,460
that lead to the overall impression.

608
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,981
In essence, we get to ask a question

609
00:23:47,981 --> 00:23:50,803
at every moment of the playthrough,

610
00:23:50,803 --> 00:23:53,485
and we get an answer without interfering

611
00:23:53,485 --> 00:23:54,886
with the experience.

612
00:23:54,886 --> 00:23:55,967
I think that's spectacular.

613
00:23:56,631 --> 00:23:58,152
So this is what I'm most optimistic about.

614
00:23:58,152 --> 00:24:01,113
Now, you know, I'm presenting a rosy picture, right?

615
00:24:01,113 --> 00:24:02,794
Like, work needs to be done, right?

616
00:24:02,794 --> 00:24:08,836
But with current technology, this is possible.

617
00:24:08,836 --> 00:24:11,177
We also get more objective data, right?

618
00:24:11,177 --> 00:24:13,278
Internal sensations are not interpreted by the player,

619
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:17,080
right, they're not conflated or created.

620
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,881
And we avoid memory, you know, memory problems, as I said.

621
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,920
We'd know if someone was feeling challenged

622
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,540
instead of just hoping that they reply

623
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,421
to our question honestly.

624
00:24:26,421 --> 00:24:28,142
We could truly know if a player was feeling,

625
00:24:28,142 --> 00:24:29,602
we're doing game balance, right,

626
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:31,923
and we ask them in a playtest, was that hard?

627
00:24:31,923 --> 00:24:33,644
Some people don't like being honest.

628
00:24:33,644 --> 00:24:34,884
We would know.

629
00:24:34,884 --> 00:24:37,005
Think about this.

630
00:24:37,005 --> 00:24:40,166
Instead of trying to induce a particular emotion

631
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:42,107
in gameplay, like is a player afraid?

632
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:43,467
Are they excited?

633
00:24:43,467 --> 00:24:44,248
Are they surprised?

634
00:24:44,248 --> 00:24:46,508
What if we could actually know?

635
00:24:47,948 --> 00:24:48,688
Right?

636
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:50,649
Like we haven't, we're designing with intent,

637
00:24:50,649 --> 00:24:53,050
we're trying to induce particular emotions and sensations.

638
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:56,472
We could actually know if a player was experiencing them.

639
00:24:56,472 --> 00:24:59,533
We could also do this at scale.

640
00:24:59,533 --> 00:25:00,794
Right?

641
00:25:00,794 --> 00:25:04,035
We derive so much information from bringing people in

642
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:04,996
and play testing at Valve.

643
00:25:04,996 --> 00:25:10,158
But what if we could do that on everybody?

644
00:25:10,158 --> 00:25:12,579
We'd have much more information about how people

645
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:13,980
were playing and consuming our games.

646
00:25:15,721 --> 00:25:17,462
At the moment, playtesting on the population

647
00:25:17,462 --> 00:25:19,843
means you look at changes in measurable player behavior.

648
00:25:19,843 --> 00:25:22,585
Like, 20% of players are playing this map, whatnot.

649
00:25:22,585 --> 00:25:28,068
But if we could get the advantages of direct observation

650
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:33,571
and of internal state out to everybody,

651
00:25:33,571 --> 00:25:36,813
we'd be much better game designers.

652
00:25:36,813 --> 00:25:38,754
If BCIs or any form of physiological measurement

653
00:25:38,754 --> 00:25:41,536
were prevalent, and all our players had access to them,

654
00:25:41,536 --> 00:25:43,697
and we had access to that data,

655
00:25:43,697 --> 00:25:44,857
we could always be playtesting.

656
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,382
on everyone and be asking every question we care about.

657
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:53,363
Maybe not every question, but a lot of the important ones.

658
00:25:53,363 --> 00:25:57,085
We're also getting new kinds of data,

659
00:25:57,085 --> 00:25:59,246
data we've never had before.

660
00:25:59,246 --> 00:26:00,546
We're no longer limited by the behaviors

661
00:26:00,546 --> 00:26:01,707
we can explicitly measure.

662
00:26:01,707 --> 00:26:03,767
We can start trying to infer rationales behind behaviors,

663
00:26:03,767 --> 00:26:06,448
looking for positive responses or negative responses.

664
00:26:08,239 --> 00:26:10,460
and whether a player is more or less engaged.

665
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,160
We can get more accurate measures of overall sentiment

666
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,941
and we're getting much more granular measures

667
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:16,541
of individual sentiment and more granular measures

668
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:17,482
of how players are responding

669
00:26:17,482 --> 00:26:27,445
to individual gameplay components.

670
00:26:27,445 --> 00:26:29,985
Here are a few examples.

671
00:26:29,985 --> 00:26:31,826
We could predict when someone is about to quit

672
00:26:31,826 --> 00:26:33,966
both the session and maybe forever.

673
00:26:33,966 --> 00:26:36,527
We can better understand game balance.

674
00:26:38,117 --> 00:26:40,999
We can see if forum responses correlate to overall player sentiment.

675
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:44,622
This has been something I've been fascinated by for a very long time.

676
00:26:44,622 --> 00:26:48,624
Is what we're seeing people write on forums and in emails,

677
00:26:48,624 --> 00:26:50,085
is that a loud minority or a loud majority?

678
00:26:50,085 --> 00:26:54,368
We could better understand if the data we're getting from forums

679
00:26:54,368 --> 00:26:58,251
and from people writing in actually correlates to how people

680
00:26:58,251 --> 00:27:00,212
are experiencing the game out in the real world.

681
00:27:01,385 --> 00:27:03,346
We can better understand impressions of a new weapon,

682
00:27:03,346 --> 00:27:04,846
a character, a cosmetic, a map, a game mode.

683
00:27:04,846 --> 00:27:07,208
We can figure out what parts of an update somebody enjoyed

684
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,729
and how they feel about the game's interface.

685
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:11,209
We can figure out which players are toxic,

686
00:27:11,209 --> 00:27:13,691
which players are good teammates.

687
00:27:13,691 --> 00:27:15,391
We can find out the most satisfying elements of gameplay

688
00:27:15,391 --> 00:27:15,912
and the least.

689
00:27:15,912 --> 00:27:19,333
What parts of the environment do they hate?

690
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:20,654
And how hopeful the tutorial ends up being.

691
00:27:20,654 --> 00:27:29,918
We can also compare responses over time.

692
00:27:31,757 --> 00:27:33,178
We could look at sentiments pre and post update

693
00:27:33,178 --> 00:27:34,239
and assess sentiment.

694
00:27:34,239 --> 00:27:35,940
We could estimate a game's life cycle.

695
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,263
You can do this with surveys and other methodologies,

696
00:27:39,263 --> 00:27:40,584
but effort is required.

697
00:27:40,584 --> 00:27:44,607
What if we knew how someone felt on their first session?

698
00:27:44,607 --> 00:27:45,568
And how they felt on their 10th?

699
00:27:45,568 --> 00:27:48,230
And how they felt on their 100th?

700
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:51,253
And how they felt on the session

701
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:53,054
that was the last session of your game they ever played?

702
00:27:53,054 --> 00:27:57,678
Very useful to understand how a player

703
00:27:57,678 --> 00:27:58,779
is experiencing your game over time

704
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:00,600
and how their feelings about your game change over time.

705
00:28:03,653 --> 00:28:07,537
And it becomes another useful tool in the toolbox.

706
00:28:07,537 --> 00:28:10,159
We can combine data about someone's internal state

707
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,822
with every other data source we have.

708
00:28:12,822 --> 00:28:14,784
Gives us more ways to figure out the why

709
00:28:14,784 --> 00:28:15,624
of what is occurring.

710
00:28:15,624 --> 00:28:20,889
So we become smarter game designers.

711
00:28:20,889 --> 00:28:22,631
This is me trying to relax.

712
00:28:22,631 --> 00:28:23,952
I wasn't relaxing, I was trying to relax.

713
00:28:27,137 --> 00:28:29,118
This is data from me seeing the unusual weapon

714
00:28:29,118 --> 00:28:29,658
I made in TF2.

715
00:28:29,658 --> 00:28:32,920
For those unfamiliar, unusuals are weapons in TF2

716
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,881
that have particle effects.

717
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:37,102
I made one, I like seeing it, it makes me happy.

718
00:28:37,102 --> 00:28:39,903
This is me getting a kill in TF2.

719
00:28:39,903 --> 00:28:43,685
So the question to ask is,

720
00:28:43,685 --> 00:28:46,546
where else do I have a similar response to this?

721
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:51,172
Is getting a kill the same as seeing my unusual?

722
00:28:51,172 --> 00:28:53,433
There actually are some similarities here.

723
00:28:53,433 --> 00:28:55,094
We won't get into the weeds on that.

724
00:28:55,094 --> 00:28:58,877
I know it looks a little bit different.

725
00:28:58,877 --> 00:29:00,498
But both of those are positive reactions.

726
00:29:00,498 --> 00:29:02,599
And so the trick here is saying,

727
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:05,861
okay, we think this is a positive reaction.

728
00:29:05,861 --> 00:29:07,662
Where else do I have similar responses in game?

729
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:10,945
If we could do that, we could start saying,

730
00:29:10,945 --> 00:29:12,666
yeah, these are the things that I like

731
00:29:12,666 --> 00:29:13,246
about Team Fortress 2.

732
00:29:13,246 --> 00:29:15,568
Maybe these are the things I don't.

733
00:29:20,067 --> 00:29:22,149
So that was playtesting.

734
00:29:22,149 --> 00:29:23,030
Let's go on to step two.

735
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,511
This is step two in our BCI timeline,

736
00:29:24,511 --> 00:29:26,874
the second major way that games could be impacted.

737
00:29:26,874 --> 00:29:30,978
What if we could reliably measure various internal states?

738
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:33,661
What kinds of gameplay could we begin to create?

739
00:29:33,661 --> 00:29:36,324
This is a slide from, or well, yeah,

740
00:29:36,324 --> 00:29:38,146
I guess a creative slide about Left 4 Dead,

741
00:29:38,146 --> 00:29:39,427
which is a game that came out a long time ago,

742
00:29:39,427 --> 00:29:41,489
but was one of our first attempts

743
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:43,191
at trying to design games that were adaptive.

744
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:47,391
So the middle line here is essentially

745
00:29:47,391 --> 00:29:50,832
an estimated arousal level for the player.

746
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:53,092
You can see it has some peaks and valleys.

747
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:57,193
And the goal was to generate changes in that arousal level

748
00:29:57,193 --> 00:29:59,794
by increasing the number of zombies that were present.

749
00:29:59,794 --> 00:30:01,754
The desired population of zombies is on top.

750
00:30:01,754 --> 00:30:04,995
The colored zombies are boss monsters or special infected.

751
00:30:04,995 --> 00:30:09,216
And the bottom is the actual zombies that were created.

752
00:30:09,216 --> 00:30:13,017
So the goal here was to create a series of peaks and valleys

753
00:30:13,017 --> 00:30:13,537
for the player.

754
00:30:14,257 --> 00:30:16,499
Is that the right pattern of arousal?

755
00:30:16,499 --> 00:30:17,179
Who knows?

756
00:30:17,179 --> 00:30:21,743
But what if we could reliably measure that

757
00:30:21,743 --> 00:30:24,805
and figure out what the right pattern of arousal was

758
00:30:24,805 --> 00:30:28,588
and have a game adapt to what a player was experiencing?

759
00:30:28,588 --> 00:30:33,491
How would that change how you make games?

760
00:30:33,491 --> 00:30:36,293
What if all you knew was a player was experiencing

761
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:38,435
positive or negative emotion?

762
00:30:38,435 --> 00:30:39,695
How would this change game design?

763
00:30:39,695 --> 00:30:41,217
Could we start placing reactions in context?

764
00:30:42,643 --> 00:30:45,264
Just think about everything you could do.

765
00:30:45,264 --> 00:30:47,085
If you just knew if a player is feeling positively

766
00:30:47,085 --> 00:30:48,965
or negatively towards the game.

767
00:30:48,965 --> 00:30:51,226
Or even better, a specific aspect of the game.

768
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:53,466
And we'll go through some examples.

769
00:30:53,466 --> 00:30:55,106
And obviously we don't want to eliminate

770
00:30:55,106 --> 00:30:56,047
all negative examples.

771
00:30:56,047 --> 00:30:58,227
Positive things are positive by comparison

772
00:30:58,227 --> 00:30:58,807
to negative things.

773
00:30:58,807 --> 00:31:01,548
But we can definitely adjust the balance.

774
00:31:01,548 --> 00:31:04,569
We can figure out ways to mitigate the impact

775
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:06,269
of negative occurrences and heighten the impact

776
00:31:06,269 --> 00:31:06,869
of positive ones.

777
00:31:06,869 --> 00:31:10,850
So think about having adaptive enemies.

778
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,931
What kinds of enemies do you like playing against in game?

779
00:31:13,931 --> 00:31:16,633
What kinds of enemies are challenging?

780
00:31:16,633 --> 00:31:17,353
What kinds are boring?

781
00:31:17,353 --> 00:31:20,135
If we knew the answers to these questions,

782
00:31:20,135 --> 00:31:22,456
we could have the game give you more of the challenging kind

783
00:31:22,456 --> 00:31:23,417
and less of the boring kind.

784
00:31:23,417 --> 00:31:27,199
Instead of difficulty levels,

785
00:31:27,199 --> 00:31:30,280
we become a thing of the past, right?

786
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,102
We don't have easy, you know, casual, novice,

787
00:31:33,102 --> 00:31:35,764
advanced, hard, hardcore, nightmare, whatever.

788
00:31:35,764 --> 00:31:39,706
We have dynamic difficulty adjustment, right?

789
00:31:40,741 --> 00:31:42,503
We have difficulty that's designed for you,

790
00:31:42,503 --> 00:31:44,164
to give you the challenge that you're craving

791
00:31:44,164 --> 00:31:44,985
at that point in time.

792
00:31:44,985 --> 00:31:47,407
Sometimes you might want things harder,

793
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:49,910
sometimes you might want them easier.

794
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:50,831
We'd be able to figure that out.

795
00:31:50,831 --> 00:31:54,735
What is it like to only be able to kill an enemy

796
00:31:54,735 --> 00:31:57,718
while you're relaxed?

797
00:31:57,718 --> 00:31:59,139
Maybe it's nothing.

798
00:31:59,139 --> 00:31:59,820
Maybe it's a gimmick.

799
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,162
Maybe it's something different, a new kind of gameplay.

800
00:32:03,107 --> 00:32:04,908
So as we walk through these examples,

801
00:32:04,908 --> 00:32:06,670
it may be the kinds of changes I'm discussing,

802
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:09,072
they won't quite work with conventional game designs.

803
00:32:09,072 --> 00:32:10,714
That's fine.

804
00:32:10,714 --> 00:32:12,275
And so let's start to think about new kinds

805
00:32:12,275 --> 00:32:14,337
of gameplay experiences that might be better suited

806
00:32:14,337 --> 00:32:16,319
to make use of this data.

807
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:17,280
These are adaptive enemies.

808
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,182
Let's think about adaptive teammates.

809
00:32:19,182 --> 00:32:21,964
What kinds of teammates do you like playing with?

810
00:32:21,964 --> 00:32:23,266
Or hate playing with?

811
00:32:23,266 --> 00:32:26,128
What parts of the game do you enjoy doing?

812
00:32:27,609 --> 00:32:28,810
We could pair you up with other people

813
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:30,651
who like doing the things that you don't like to do

814
00:32:30,651 --> 00:32:33,252
and form better and more cohesive teams.

815
00:32:33,252 --> 00:32:36,054
If we could identify toxic players

816
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:37,955
or you're feeling that somebody's a toxic player,

817
00:32:37,955 --> 00:32:40,436
we could automatically mute them or keep you separated.

818
00:32:40,436 --> 00:32:43,098
What if you knew how your teammates were feeling?

819
00:32:43,098 --> 00:32:46,079
What if they knew how you were feeling?

820
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:47,340
Again, I'm asking questions

821
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,361
not because I necessarily have the answers,

822
00:32:49,361 --> 00:32:51,903
but I think that BCI technology makes them seem

823
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,263
like interesting questions to ask.

824
00:32:55,683 --> 00:32:57,344
What about adaptive rewards?

825
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:00,746
Here are examples of a few rewards in Counter-Strike.

826
00:33:00,746 --> 00:33:04,468
We have new items, badges, friend requests,

827
00:33:04,468 --> 00:33:05,789
social rewards, XP.

828
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:08,430
We could figure out what kinds of rewards you like

829
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,871
and the ones you don't.

830
00:33:09,871 --> 00:33:11,992
We could start tailoring rewards to the individual player.

831
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:15,114
So we would avoid the things you didn't like

832
00:33:15,114 --> 00:33:17,856
and give you more of the things you did.

833
00:33:17,856 --> 00:33:19,557
The theme I want to hammer home is that games,

834
00:33:19,557 --> 00:33:21,478
in some sense, become way less static.

835
00:33:21,478 --> 00:33:22,979
And obviously games are not static,

836
00:33:22,979 --> 00:33:25,120
but on one axis they are.

837
00:33:26,354 --> 00:33:28,275
They could be a lot more adaptive.

838
00:33:28,275 --> 00:33:29,295
They could learn more about you,

839
00:33:29,295 --> 00:33:31,695
and they could respond to individually what you're doing

840
00:33:31,695 --> 00:33:36,337
and how you're experiencing it.

841
00:33:36,337 --> 00:33:40,138
What about avatars that mimic your mood?

842
00:33:40,138 --> 00:33:41,438
What if in-game characters reacted to it?

843
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:44,679
What if you had conversations and interactions

844
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:46,299
that more closely mimicked reality?

845
00:33:46,299 --> 00:33:50,520
Just imagine more realistic conversations.

846
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,961
We're not gonna solve the Turing test tomorrow,

847
00:33:51,961 --> 00:33:54,921
but we could change how you interact with NPCs

848
00:33:54,921 --> 00:33:55,862
with other players.

849
00:33:57,077 --> 00:33:58,458
they could see you were feeling frustrated

850
00:33:58,458 --> 00:33:59,539
or if you were happy or if you were sad.

851
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:02,520
Just like, true, think about it.

852
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,582
But like, you know, games right now, we do our best.

853
00:34:05,582 --> 00:34:10,845
Interactions could get a whole lot more realistic

854
00:34:10,845 --> 00:34:14,127
and engaging.

855
00:34:14,127 --> 00:34:16,809
Here's an image from Dota.

856
00:34:16,809 --> 00:34:17,609
Just take a look at it.

857
00:34:17,609 --> 00:34:22,032
What aspects of it do you like or dislike?

858
00:34:22,032 --> 00:34:23,453
Which heroes or characters in the game

859
00:34:23,453 --> 00:34:24,233
do you like or dislike?

860
00:34:25,478 --> 00:34:28,640
How do you feel about the trees, or the flames,

861
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:34,064
the health bars, the combat, the strategy, the tactics?

862
00:34:34,064 --> 00:34:35,805
All of a sudden, we start becoming able to assess

863
00:34:35,805 --> 00:34:38,106
how you're responding to various elements in game,

864
00:34:38,106 --> 00:34:40,948
and maybe we can start having the game change things.

865
00:34:40,948 --> 00:34:43,510
We can make small changes, we can make big changes,

866
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,632
we can even make medium-sized changes.

867
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:48,794
So this is the question.

868
00:34:48,794 --> 00:34:51,556
How does gameplay change when you know

869
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:52,776
what the player is experiencing?

870
00:34:54,347 --> 00:34:55,828
What aspects of the game could we change

871
00:34:55,828 --> 00:34:57,208
if we knew how the player was responding?

872
00:34:57,208 --> 00:35:00,250
If we knew if a player was frustrated,

873
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,710
or engaged, or feeling challenged, or immersed,

874
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,031
what if they were in flow?

875
00:35:03,031 --> 00:35:04,151
The game could respond to the player

876
00:35:04,151 --> 00:35:11,574
as a consequence of knowing what they were doing.

877
00:35:11,574 --> 00:35:14,215
We could give you cues when you're frustrated.

878
00:35:14,215 --> 00:35:16,916
We could give you challenge when you're bored.

879
00:35:16,916 --> 00:35:21,538
We could figure out what keeps you intrinsically motivated

880
00:35:21,538 --> 00:35:22,978
and better understand when we're failing.

881
00:35:24,476 --> 00:35:27,238
We can figure out where extrinsic motivation is unnecessary or unneeded.

882
00:35:27,238 --> 00:35:32,302
We can figure out what leads to flow or immersion and when you're in it

883
00:35:32,302 --> 00:35:34,523
and when you're about to become in it.

884
00:35:34,523 --> 00:35:40,027
We can improve accessibility and figure out when players needed assistance.

885
00:35:40,027 --> 00:35:43,150
We can enlarge text, change audio cues, change gameplay, reduce complexity.

886
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:48,513
We can figure out what a player needed and respond accordingly.

887
00:35:52,134 --> 00:35:54,336
Here's a screenshot from Valve's best known game,

888
00:35:54,336 --> 00:35:54,877
Alien Swarm.

889
00:35:54,877 --> 00:35:57,820
Came out a while ago, it's a top-down shooter,

890
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,842
awesome game, a lot of fun to play.

891
00:35:59,842 --> 00:36:01,443
This is an experiment we did a while ago

892
00:36:01,443 --> 00:36:03,785
where we used physiological signals,

893
00:36:03,785 --> 00:36:05,888
physiological arousal, as an input to the game.

894
00:36:06,927 --> 00:36:10,728
We gave you four minutes to kill 100 enemies,

895
00:36:10,728 --> 00:36:12,809
and the timer would tick down quicker

896
00:36:12,809 --> 00:36:15,489
if you got more aroused, if you got more excited,

897
00:36:15,489 --> 00:36:17,630
which would then cause you to get even more excited,

898
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,870
and then it would tick down even quicker,

899
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:21,591
and so you get a negative feedback loop.

900
00:36:21,591 --> 00:36:23,751
And so, you know, it's one design that may or may not

901
00:36:23,751 --> 00:36:26,812
actually end up being suitable for consumption,

902
00:36:26,812 --> 00:36:27,932
but you can start thinking about

903
00:36:27,932 --> 00:36:29,792
novel kinds of gameplay experiences

904
00:36:29,792 --> 00:36:31,893
when physiological data becomes an input,

905
00:36:31,893 --> 00:36:32,713
a direct input to the game.

906
00:36:32,713 --> 00:36:36,794
Imagine a spy game where you actually have to be a spy.

907
00:36:38,048 --> 00:36:41,029
and fool people with your voice, your words,

908
00:36:41,029 --> 00:36:45,091
your behavior, and your thoughts.

909
00:36:45,091 --> 00:36:47,692
What about a true role-playing game

910
00:36:47,692 --> 00:36:49,593
where you actually had to play as the character

911
00:36:49,593 --> 00:36:51,714
you are currently pretending to play as?

912
00:36:51,714 --> 00:36:55,076
Maybe these are gimmicks, that's fine.

913
00:36:55,076 --> 00:36:59,938
Maybe there's something different, something cool.

914
00:36:59,938 --> 00:37:03,299
Could we teach players how to play our games

915
00:37:03,299 --> 00:37:03,980
more effectively?

916
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:07,191
How great are we designing tutorials right now?

917
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:09,572
Maybe we're really, really good.

918
00:37:09,572 --> 00:37:11,312
We could probably be better.

919
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,733
We could figure out when a player was learning

920
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:17,555
or in a state that was amenable to learning, right?

921
00:37:17,555 --> 00:37:18,575
Maybe figure out why they learned.

922
00:37:18,575 --> 00:37:20,175
And help them learn quicker.

923
00:37:20,175 --> 00:37:23,617
Could better understand what are the components

924
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:24,537
of skill in a game.

925
00:37:24,537 --> 00:37:27,958
And teach them to other players.

926
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:32,420
And conversely, could we teach games

927
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,840
how to play our players more effectively?

928
00:37:34,768 --> 00:37:37,629
I could spend hours on this slide, but I won't.

929
00:37:37,629 --> 00:37:40,569
We have a limited time remaining.

930
00:37:40,569 --> 00:37:44,330
But think about, you know, game dynamics,

931
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:46,731
they're no longer static if we had access to this data.

932
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:49,472
You know, we start discovering what the player

933
00:37:49,472 --> 00:37:50,132
enjoys or doesn't.

934
00:37:50,132 --> 00:37:52,572
We're making fewer assumptions about the player's

935
00:37:52,572 --> 00:37:54,753
intent or preference and creating a broader range

936
00:37:54,753 --> 00:37:57,194
of experiences for the player.

937
00:37:57,194 --> 00:37:59,054
Just as players respond to the game,

938
00:37:59,054 --> 00:38:00,735
games can start to respond to the player.

939
00:38:02,592 --> 00:38:05,393
If these are the kinds of gameplay experiences you like,

940
00:38:05,393 --> 00:38:07,794
well, we can start to give you more of them,

941
00:38:07,794 --> 00:38:10,875
less of the ones you don't.

942
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:12,535
Games will start to learn how players

943
00:38:12,535 --> 00:38:15,877
want to play their games, and as a consequence,

944
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:19,018
gameplay becomes adaptive and personalized.

945
00:38:19,018 --> 00:38:20,318
We start modifying aspects of the game,

946
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:22,759
the difficulty, the individual components of the gameplay,

947
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:24,720
the rewards, the teammates, the weapons you get.

948
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,262
We change the visuals, the sound, the interfaces.

949
00:38:29,262 --> 00:38:30,783
All of this can adapt to what you're feeling

950
00:38:30,783 --> 00:38:31,503
and experiencing.

951
00:38:32,514 --> 00:38:34,255
So gameplay is no longer one size fits all.

952
00:38:34,255 --> 00:38:37,016
It's tailored to the player.

953
00:38:37,016 --> 00:38:39,577
It's no longer a game for everyone.

954
00:38:39,577 --> 00:38:44,119
It's a game for you.

955
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:46,800
Step three, interface replacements,

956
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,641
the true BCI, the endgame.

957
00:38:49,641 --> 00:38:50,961
So we're gonna start getting speculative,

958
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:53,562
or at least more speculative than we've been so far.

959
00:38:53,562 --> 00:38:57,524
So let's go back to that question.

960
00:38:57,524 --> 00:39:00,045
How will you interact with technology in 10 years?

961
00:39:01,803 --> 00:39:03,744
Well, when you say be sad at people,

962
00:39:03,744 --> 00:39:05,485
sometimes they think, you know,

963
00:39:05,485 --> 00:39:10,589
you're gonna think a thing and it happens.

964
00:39:10,589 --> 00:39:11,269
Removing the middleman.

965
00:39:11,269 --> 00:39:13,331
Right now we have human intent,

966
00:39:13,331 --> 00:39:15,452
translated via physical interface,

967
00:39:15,452 --> 00:39:18,034
induces a response in the system.

968
00:39:18,034 --> 00:39:22,217
So, what happens if we remove the physical interface?

969
00:39:22,217 --> 00:39:23,838
We have human intent,

970
00:39:23,838 --> 00:39:25,299
it just directly leads to a system response.

971
00:39:25,299 --> 00:39:29,442
If we remove the middleman, what becomes possible?

972
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:33,251
If we could reliably understand

973
00:39:33,251 --> 00:39:34,851
what you were thinking or feeling

974
00:39:34,851 --> 00:39:37,232
and have a system respond, how would that change things?

975
00:39:37,232 --> 00:39:41,754
This may be decades away, but people are doing things now

976
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,875
that imply that it might not be.

977
00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:47,517
And this is one direction, human intent

978
00:39:47,517 --> 00:39:49,817
leading to a system response.

979
00:39:49,817 --> 00:39:52,419
We have to go back the other way too.

980
00:39:52,419 --> 00:39:55,540
The system has to respond to the human.

981
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:59,201
So it can do so via current display technology

982
00:39:59,201 --> 00:39:59,342
or

983
00:40:00,642 --> 00:40:05,045
Might wanna remove the middleman from that direction too.

984
00:40:05,045 --> 00:40:07,507
We need to figure out how to wait for the system

985
00:40:07,507 --> 00:40:09,188
to send a response back to the user,

986
00:40:09,188 --> 00:40:11,730
directly, without mediation.

987
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:14,032
So how would we do that?

988
00:40:14,032 --> 00:40:16,013
Well, we can already kind of do that.

989
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:17,955
You know, what you see and perceive,

990
00:40:17,955 --> 00:40:20,997
you know, what you taste and feel and hear,

991
00:40:20,997 --> 00:40:21,517
what you think.

992
00:40:21,517 --> 00:40:24,600
All of these lead to neurons firing.

993
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,001
What if there was another way?

994
00:40:27,497 --> 00:40:29,919
There is, I've kind of alluded to this before.

995
00:40:29,919 --> 00:40:31,020
You can make neurons fire directly.

996
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,142
You can communicate with neurons

997
00:40:33,142 --> 00:40:34,823
by generating an electrical current in the brain.

998
00:40:34,823 --> 00:40:35,404
Neurons will fire.

999
00:40:35,404 --> 00:40:38,026
So you can make them fire all on their own.

1000
00:40:38,026 --> 00:40:39,587
Or all on their own.

1001
00:40:41,652 --> 00:40:43,053
This is one way of doing that.

1002
00:40:43,053 --> 00:40:44,174
This is a TMS machine.

1003
00:40:44,174 --> 00:40:46,976
Stands for transcranial magnetic stimulation.

1004
00:40:46,976 --> 00:40:48,377
It uses a magnetic field,

1005
00:40:48,377 --> 00:40:50,798
induces electrical current in the brain,

1006
00:40:50,798 --> 00:40:53,760
and is often used in research to increase

1007
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,102
or suppress neural activity in various parts of the brain.

1008
00:40:56,102 --> 00:40:58,564
And they use it for therapeutic treatments,

1009
00:40:58,564 --> 00:41:01,045
insomnia, anxiety, depression, PDSD, and whatnot.

1010
00:41:01,045 --> 00:41:03,967
If you're curious what it looks like

1011
00:41:03,967 --> 00:41:09,191
to see a TMS machine in action,

1012
00:41:09,191 --> 00:41:09,771
there you go.

1013
00:41:09,771 --> 00:41:10,792
Yeah, that's exactly how it goes.

1014
00:41:11,419 --> 00:41:14,902
All right, so what's possible when you remove

1015
00:41:14,902 --> 00:41:16,503
the interface entirely?

1016
00:41:16,503 --> 00:41:19,346
We're gonna go back to the diagram you may have seen,

1017
00:41:19,346 --> 00:41:22,149
you remember from earlier in the talk.

1018
00:41:22,149 --> 00:41:25,051
Five ways that BCIs can change the way we interact.

1019
00:41:25,051 --> 00:41:27,734
Neural prosthetics, understanding restricted forms

1020
00:41:27,734 --> 00:41:29,575
of cognitive intent, figuring out ways

1021
00:41:29,575 --> 00:41:31,537
to augment perception or cognition,

1022
00:41:31,537 --> 00:41:36,021
and then the true endgame, being able to enter the matrix.

1023
00:41:39,884 --> 00:41:43,707
So neuroprosthetics, these are sensory or motor replacements.

1024
00:41:43,707 --> 00:41:46,689
Vision, think about vision.

1025
00:41:46,689 --> 00:41:50,012
It's simply, it's a construct of neurons firing.

1026
00:41:50,012 --> 00:41:52,994
Light passes through the retina,

1027
00:41:52,994 --> 00:41:55,976
it's transmitted to various aspects of the visual cortex.

1028
00:41:55,976 --> 00:41:57,378
These neurons fire in particular ways

1029
00:41:57,378 --> 00:41:58,999
and we get the perception of sight,

1030
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:01,441
what we're seeing right now.

1031
00:42:01,441 --> 00:42:04,223
If your retina fails, we could bypass the retina.

1032
00:42:05,072 --> 00:42:07,132
and still give you sight if we make neurons fire

1033
00:42:07,132 --> 00:42:08,773
in ways that you can understand and interpret.

1034
00:42:08,773 --> 00:42:11,734
People do the same thing with cochlear implants.

1035
00:42:11,734 --> 00:42:15,615
How people with auditory impairments hear again.

1036
00:42:15,615 --> 00:42:17,295
Think about people who are paralyzed.

1037
00:42:17,295 --> 00:42:19,636
Well, if we can stimulate neurons in the motor cortex,

1038
00:42:19,636 --> 00:42:21,336
we don't need signals from the peripheral nervous system.

1039
00:42:21,336 --> 00:42:23,977
People are doing this right now,

1040
00:42:23,977 --> 00:42:31,799
trying to help paralyzed people walk and blind people see.

1041
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:32,740
What if we understood?

1042
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,141
rudimentarily, what you were thinking.

1043
00:42:36,141 --> 00:42:38,121
We could replace a mouse or a keyboard or a gamepad.

1044
00:42:38,121 --> 00:42:39,962
There are probably people in this room

1045
00:42:39,962 --> 00:42:42,103
who are working on that at this moment,

1046
00:42:42,103 --> 00:42:43,484
being able to type with your thoughts,

1047
00:42:43,484 --> 00:42:45,844
navigate through an environment with your thoughts,

1048
00:42:45,844 --> 00:42:46,985
make a selection with your thoughts.

1049
00:42:46,985 --> 00:42:51,847
What about augmenting perception?

1050
00:42:51,847 --> 00:42:55,288
Could we make you see in infrared, like the predator?

1051
00:42:55,288 --> 00:42:58,469
Could we increase contrast sensitivity,

1052
00:42:58,469 --> 00:43:00,070
help you see with a higher resolution,

1053
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,771
or give you access to other spatial information,

1054
00:43:01,771 --> 00:43:02,451
like echolocation?

1055
00:43:03,675 --> 00:43:05,056
Could we make you navigate like a bat?

1056
00:43:05,056 --> 00:43:05,897
Could we add a sense?

1057
00:43:05,897 --> 00:43:08,179
Could we improve your sense of touch?

1058
00:43:08,179 --> 00:43:09,820
Let you hear at different frequencies.

1059
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,281
Taste and smell new things you've never

1060
00:43:11,281 --> 00:43:13,903
tasted and smelled before.

1061
00:43:13,903 --> 00:43:16,825
People are looking at this too.

1062
00:43:16,825 --> 00:43:17,906
What about augmenting cognition?

1063
00:43:17,906 --> 00:43:18,947
Cognition is tricky.

1064
00:43:18,947 --> 00:43:19,888
There's a lot we don't know.

1065
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:22,170
What if we could focus attention?

1066
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:25,912
This would make you better at attending

1067
00:43:25,912 --> 00:43:26,773
to what you wanted to attend to.

1068
00:43:26,773 --> 00:43:29,635
What if we could stimulate appropriate areas of the brain

1069
00:43:29,635 --> 00:43:31,237
and prevent you from being distracted?

1070
00:43:33,288 --> 00:43:35,590
What if we could recruit neurons for other processing tasks?

1071
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:37,692
Or increase your short-term memory capacity?

1072
00:43:37,692 --> 00:43:41,936
Make you hold more memory at once.

1073
00:43:41,936 --> 00:43:42,997
That would be incredibly powerful.

1074
00:43:42,997 --> 00:43:45,659
What if we could improve memory retrieval,

1075
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:47,601
or the resolution of long-term memory?

1076
00:43:47,601 --> 00:43:50,523
If we could help you learn quicker and more effectively,

1077
00:43:50,523 --> 00:43:52,345
or speed up your reaction time to various stimuli.

1078
00:43:52,345 --> 00:43:55,608
Or help you interface directly with machines.

1079
00:43:55,608 --> 00:43:59,111
If you treat insomnia,

1080
00:44:00,291 --> 00:44:01,992
via some sort of BCI interface.

1081
00:44:01,992 --> 00:44:03,253
Are you augmenting cognition?

1082
00:44:03,253 --> 00:44:05,795
To me, the answer is yes.

1083
00:44:05,795 --> 00:44:07,035
That's happening now.

1084
00:44:07,035 --> 00:44:11,638
And then there's the matrix, the endgame, right?

1085
00:44:11,638 --> 00:44:14,600
Calling it like an augmentation of experiences,

1086
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,701
you know, it's underselling it.

1087
00:44:15,701 --> 00:44:17,922
But if neurons are truly creating

1088
00:44:17,922 --> 00:44:19,603
every sensation that we have,

1089
00:44:19,603 --> 00:44:22,505
well, if you can stimulate neurons directly,

1090
00:44:22,505 --> 00:44:24,026
you can put people inside the matrix.

1091
00:44:24,892 --> 00:44:29,056
This is, again, decades and maybe even centuries away.

1092
00:44:29,056 --> 00:44:32,539
But the path forward, the path to that, I guess, reality,

1093
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:39,847
people can see it, and they're actively working on it.

1094
00:44:39,847 --> 00:44:41,028
So we've talked all about, well yeah,

1095
00:44:41,028 --> 00:44:43,711
this is me contemplating challenges now

1096
00:44:43,711 --> 00:44:45,813
with my BCI headset, EEG headset.

1097
00:44:47,567 --> 00:44:50,550
So we talked all about the possible things,

1098
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:51,470
why BCIs might be interesting.

1099
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:53,872
So let's talk about the problems,

1100
00:44:53,872 --> 00:44:56,054
the things we have to do to get there.

1101
00:44:56,054 --> 00:44:59,477
As a psychologist, I know I shouldn't put negative slides

1102
00:44:59,477 --> 00:45:00,117
at the end of the talk.

1103
00:45:00,117 --> 00:45:01,918
I want you guys to go out on a positive note,

1104
00:45:01,918 --> 00:45:04,000
and I do have a few positive slides at the end,

1105
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,902
but I absolutely want to be realistic

1106
00:45:05,902 --> 00:45:07,963
about the challenges that lie in BCI implementation.

1107
00:45:07,963 --> 00:45:09,664
I'm saying a lot of optimistic things up here,

1108
00:45:09,664 --> 00:45:11,666
and that's fine, right?

1109
00:45:11,666 --> 00:45:14,088
I'm trying to encourage discourse around it,

1110
00:45:14,088 --> 00:45:17,150
but there are a lot of hard things we have to do.

1111
00:45:17,416 --> 00:45:19,698
I guess to enable these technologies.

1112
00:45:19,698 --> 00:45:23,720
So neuroscience has a long way to go.

1113
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,782
Neuroscience is in its infancy.

1114
00:45:25,782 --> 00:45:27,003
We understand some things.

1115
00:45:27,003 --> 00:45:29,865
Sensory stuff is great, motor stuff is great,

1116
00:45:29,865 --> 00:45:31,446
relatively great.

1117
00:45:31,446 --> 00:45:33,367
Higher level cognition is tough.

1118
00:45:33,367 --> 00:45:38,291
And how we get there is hard to tell.

1119
00:45:38,291 --> 00:45:39,792
There's so much we don't understand.

1120
00:45:39,792 --> 00:45:41,513
Like how do you think a thought?

1121
00:45:41,513 --> 00:45:45,356
How do you remember something that happened last week?

1122
00:45:45,356 --> 00:45:46,217
How do you solve a problem?

1123
00:45:47,093 --> 00:45:49,714
How do you play a game?

1124
00:45:49,714 --> 00:45:50,395
How do you feel love?

1125
00:45:50,395 --> 00:45:52,536
There's so much we don't understand

1126
00:45:52,536 --> 00:45:54,718
and so much we need to figure out

1127
00:45:54,718 --> 00:45:55,678
to get to where we want to go.

1128
00:45:55,678 --> 00:46:01,362
There is a common analogy that people

1129
00:46:01,362 --> 00:46:03,043
who are doing BCRI research like to use,

1130
00:46:03,043 --> 00:46:05,504
which is that recording neurological activity

1131
00:46:05,504 --> 00:46:07,806
from outside the brain or outside the skull

1132
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:09,487
is like standing outside a football stadium

1133
00:46:09,487 --> 00:46:10,928
with your ear against the concrete

1134
00:46:10,928 --> 00:46:12,729
and listening to the cheers

1135
00:46:12,729 --> 00:46:13,870
and trying to figure out what's happening.

1136
00:46:14,798 --> 00:46:16,560
You might be able to tell when something important

1137
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,621
is happening, loud cheer, if it's positive or negative,

1138
00:46:18,621 --> 00:46:22,043
depending on which stadium you're at.

1139
00:46:22,043 --> 00:46:24,225
But data is incredibly noisy.

1140
00:46:24,225 --> 00:46:26,126
It's noisy inside the brain and it's way noisier

1141
00:46:26,126 --> 00:46:31,189
if you have to pass through the scalp and the skull and hair.

1142
00:46:31,189 --> 00:46:34,632
Data is noisy, so neurological data is hard to parse.

1143
00:46:34,632 --> 00:46:36,493
We need to figure out how to do a better job

1144
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:37,854
of analyzing it and processing it.

1145
00:46:37,854 --> 00:46:41,396
And going hand in hand with noisy data, right,

1146
00:46:41,396 --> 00:46:43,758
is figuring out the right tools to analyze and process it.

1147
00:46:44,383 --> 00:46:46,484
What are the most effective ways to take a look at it?

1148
00:46:46,484 --> 00:46:49,105
There's always gonna be lots of variability, right?

1149
00:46:49,105 --> 00:46:51,186
Both in an individual, like what I'm feeling now

1150
00:46:51,186 --> 00:46:53,247
is not gonna be the same way I feel like a second from now,

1151
00:46:53,247 --> 00:46:55,868
or how I felt three seconds ago, right?

1152
00:46:55,868 --> 00:46:58,129
And then obviously across populations.

1153
00:46:58,129 --> 00:46:59,170
We are gonna think differently

1154
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:00,910
and have different patterns of activity.

1155
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:03,571
So we're looking for something that is stable,

1156
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:05,992
some pattern that is reliable and coherent.

1157
00:47:05,992 --> 00:47:06,913
But it might be tough to figure out.

1158
00:47:09,182 --> 00:47:11,243
So we could just look for spike trains,

1159
00:47:11,243 --> 00:47:12,924
peaks, patterns of activation, whatever.

1160
00:47:12,924 --> 00:47:14,524
We could just throw large neural networks at the problem.

1161
00:47:14,524 --> 00:47:17,225
That's one approach people are taking.

1162
00:47:17,225 --> 00:47:18,966
But it's definitely a hard problem we need to solve.

1163
00:47:18,966 --> 00:47:20,407
And it goes hand in hand with a better

1164
00:47:20,407 --> 00:47:23,348
understanding of neuroscience.

1165
00:47:23,348 --> 00:47:25,049
Let's go back to the stadium analogy.

1166
00:47:25,049 --> 00:47:29,170
If we have noisy data, well, one way of attacking it

1167
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:31,651
is to get a large number of samples.

1168
00:47:31,651 --> 00:47:34,552
It will help us get around the noise analysis issues,

1169
00:47:34,552 --> 00:47:35,473
but we definitely need it.

1170
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:40,694
So, you can build a pretty useful data set

1171
00:47:40,694 --> 00:47:41,856
if you had lots of people giving you data,

1172
00:47:41,856 --> 00:47:45,921
and if you knew what they were seeing and hearing,

1173
00:47:45,921 --> 00:47:47,743
like if EEG sensors were built into a VR headset

1174
00:47:47,743 --> 00:47:50,687
and everybody was playing the same game.

1175
00:47:50,687 --> 00:47:52,790
That might help you make progress.

1176
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:53,210
Just a thought.

1177
00:47:56,733 --> 00:47:59,535
Imaging technology, this is the same slide from earlier,

1178
00:47:59,535 --> 00:48:00,496
has limitations, right?

1179
00:48:00,496 --> 00:48:03,098
Obviously we can't get people to carry an fMirai machine

1180
00:48:03,098 --> 00:48:05,279
around with them, but maybe EEG headsets or FNIRs

1181
00:48:05,279 --> 00:48:08,642
or new technologies people are working on can get there.

1182
00:48:08,642 --> 00:48:11,244
But what if we need invasive approaches?

1183
00:48:11,244 --> 00:48:14,926
Are you willing to let somebody do this?

1184
00:48:18,998 --> 00:48:20,719
So we can do a lot of interesting things.

1185
00:48:20,719 --> 00:48:22,219
We can improve play testing,

1186
00:48:22,219 --> 00:48:24,060
we can have adaptive experiences,

1187
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:25,681
maybe some rudimentary movement controls,

1188
00:48:25,681 --> 00:48:29,302
all of this with non-invasive stuff.

1189
00:48:29,302 --> 00:48:30,922
If we wanna go invasive,

1190
00:48:30,922 --> 00:48:32,823
people need to see a Lasik-like benefit.

1191
00:48:32,823 --> 00:48:34,983
Remember, Lasik used to be crazy,

1192
00:48:34,983 --> 00:48:36,904
shining a laser into your eye to improve your vision.

1193
00:48:36,904 --> 00:48:38,244
Now it's commonplace.

1194
00:48:38,244 --> 00:48:41,625
Will the same transformation take place

1195
00:48:41,625 --> 00:48:43,486
with invasive technologies,

1196
00:48:43,486 --> 00:48:45,727
where people implant electrode arrays in your brain?

1197
00:48:45,727 --> 00:48:47,187
Maybe, maybe not.

1198
00:48:48,772 --> 00:48:53,516
So when implants get to the LASIK stage.

1199
00:48:53,516 --> 00:48:59,802
There's also another reason I showed you this picture.

1200
00:48:59,802 --> 00:49:02,084
This is the third time I've shown a picture of Gabe.

1201
00:49:02,084 --> 00:49:03,965
Are you laughing as much as the first time?

1202
00:49:03,965 --> 00:49:04,526
The answer is no.

1203
00:49:04,526 --> 00:49:08,629
Wouldn't it be nice to have that kind of data

1204
00:49:08,629 --> 00:49:09,570
from our players?

1205
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:12,072
Wouldn't I become a better speaker

1206
00:49:12,072 --> 00:49:14,734
if I knew how you guys were reacting

1207
00:49:14,734 --> 00:49:15,895
the third time you saw this picture

1208
00:49:15,895 --> 00:49:16,956
as opposed to the first time?

1209
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:20,252
So the next time I give this talk, I'll do a better job.

1210
00:49:20,252 --> 00:49:25,095
There are also issues with the hardware costs

1211
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:27,017
and dissemination, building these things,

1212
00:49:27,017 --> 00:49:29,878
building imaging technology, getting it out to people.

1213
00:49:29,878 --> 00:49:31,059
Sensing technology costs money.

1214
00:49:31,059 --> 00:49:33,201
There needs to be a benefit to customers.

1215
00:49:33,201 --> 00:49:37,163
What if they're unwilling to share this data with customers,

1216
00:49:37,163 --> 00:49:38,844
or with us, sorry, with developers?

1217
00:49:38,844 --> 00:49:41,766
This could be personal stuff.

1218
00:49:41,766 --> 00:49:44,668
We need to be able to convince them that there is utility.

1219
00:49:45,509 --> 00:49:46,910
and helping us make better games

1220
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:51,272
and creating new kinds of gameplay experiences.

1221
00:49:51,272 --> 00:49:53,093
That might be tough to overcome.

1222
00:49:53,093 --> 00:49:54,254
Some of the technology is cheap,

1223
00:49:54,254 --> 00:49:55,975
at least on the cost side of things,

1224
00:49:55,975 --> 00:49:58,036
but some of it might not be.

1225
00:49:58,036 --> 00:50:00,558
So there need to be benefits to customers.

1226
00:50:00,558 --> 00:50:01,818
Can't just be theory.

1227
00:50:01,818 --> 00:50:05,160
We need to make something that actually works.

1228
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,722
We're also losing tactile feedback.

1229
00:50:07,722 --> 00:50:11,023
There's something comforting about holding a mouse,

1230
00:50:11,023 --> 00:50:13,765
well I guess a mouse, or a gamepad, or a keyboard, right?

1231
00:50:15,071 --> 00:50:18,114
If I mishit a button on a gamepad,

1232
00:50:18,114 --> 00:50:20,016
if I'm trying to press B to jump, or sometimes A,

1233
00:50:20,016 --> 00:50:23,760
I get pretty consistent feedback.

1234
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,782
What happens if I think a thought, I think jump,

1235
00:50:25,782 --> 00:50:26,742
and nothing happens?

1236
00:50:26,742 --> 00:50:30,106
Is it my fault for thinking incorrectly?

1237
00:50:30,106 --> 00:50:32,528
Or the system's fault for not understanding

1238
00:50:32,528 --> 00:50:33,429
what I was trying to do?

1239
00:50:33,429 --> 00:50:36,732
So this is not the largest problem we're facing,

1240
00:50:36,732 --> 00:50:37,853
but it is an issue to consider.

1241
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:41,801
And this last one is maybe the biggest.

1242
00:50:41,801 --> 00:50:44,643
This is Don Quixote attacking a windmill,

1243
00:50:44,643 --> 00:50:46,304
he's attacking an enemy that does not exist.

1244
00:50:46,304 --> 00:50:49,846
What if BCIs are not a necessity?

1245
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:54,149
What if players don't see benefit?

1246
00:50:54,149 --> 00:50:57,931
What if we as developers come up with ways

1247
00:50:57,931 --> 00:50:59,772
to take advantage of having insight into internal state?

1248
00:51:01,204 --> 00:51:04,207
I do believe I can see clearly how this would happen.

1249
00:51:04,207 --> 00:51:06,730
I've laid out a variety of ways I thought we could

1250
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,592
get better data from playtesting and design

1251
00:51:08,592 --> 00:51:10,755
gameplay experiences that don't exist.

1252
00:51:10,755 --> 00:51:12,937
But I absolutely could be wrong.

1253
00:51:12,937 --> 00:51:13,738
This is theory.

1254
00:51:13,738 --> 00:51:15,400
I'm describing things in the abstract,

1255
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,484
and it's easy to make things in the abstract sound cool.

1256
00:51:19,484 --> 00:51:21,627
So I want to acknowledge the possibility

1257
00:51:21,627 --> 00:51:22,508
that while I am optimistic,

1258
00:51:23,412 --> 00:51:24,573
We don't know yet, right?

1259
00:51:24,573 --> 00:51:26,535
We actually have to create something and see.

1260
00:51:26,535 --> 00:51:29,679
And again, we have some data that suggests it's there,

1261
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:37,888
but let's acknowledge the possibility that it might not be.

1262
00:51:37,888 --> 00:51:40,191
So we're at the end of the talk.

1263
00:51:40,191 --> 00:51:42,674
I'll summarize where we are,

1264
00:51:42,674 --> 00:51:44,035
why we think BCIs are interesting.

1265
00:51:45,413 --> 00:51:47,114
Moment to moment insight into new experience,

1266
00:51:47,114 --> 00:51:48,374
or sorry, into experience.

1267
00:51:48,374 --> 00:51:49,434
You have to do it at scale.

1268
00:51:49,434 --> 00:51:52,315
We'll get all kinds of awesome new data.

1269
00:51:52,315 --> 00:51:54,355
And we get to design games that are adaptive.

1270
00:51:54,355 --> 00:51:56,196
That probably covers a lot.

1271
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:58,436
I probably should have made that,

1272
00:51:58,436 --> 00:52:00,316
like used a larger font for that point,

1273
00:52:00,316 --> 00:52:02,577
but hopefully I've made the case

1274
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:03,537
as to why I think that's interesting.

1275
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,878
And the same for replacements for traditional interfaces,

1276
00:52:05,878 --> 00:52:07,458
right, the end game.

1277
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:11,679
New kinds of experiences become possible.

1278
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:13,019
So when can all this happen?

1279
00:52:13,019 --> 00:52:13,099
Well,

1280
00:52:14,684 --> 00:52:15,884
we actually have to start doing the work,

1281
00:52:15,884 --> 00:52:18,045
but we can start making progress

1282
00:52:18,045 --> 00:52:19,625
on playtesting and adaptive gameplay now.

1283
00:52:19,625 --> 00:52:23,006
Adaptive games might take a few years to get going,

1284
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:24,247
but we can start the process now.

1285
00:52:24,247 --> 00:52:26,307
Then interface replacements, well again,

1286
00:52:26,307 --> 00:52:27,408
people are working on things now,

1287
00:52:27,408 --> 00:52:30,088
but could be very, very far away.

1288
00:52:30,088 --> 00:52:33,509
So I don't know exactly when all of this will take place,

1289
00:52:33,509 --> 00:52:36,130
but what I do know is that in the future,

1290
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:37,451
I very much hope this is how we play.

1291
00:52:37,451 --> 00:52:38,571
So thank you very much.

1292
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:52,821
So I think we have a few minutes for questions.

1293
00:52:52,821 --> 00:52:54,662
I'll answer any now if you have them,

1294
00:52:54,662 --> 00:52:58,543
and if not, I'm happy to go to one of the wrap-up rooms

1295
00:52:58,543 --> 00:53:00,644
and chat as well.

1296
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:03,645
Hi, so is Valve doing anything dealing with

1297
00:53:03,645 --> 00:53:05,945
the collection of data from atypical brain structures?

1298
00:53:05,945 --> 00:53:08,726
So because one of the challenges is going to be

1299
00:53:08,726 --> 00:53:11,567
that people that either have abnormal brains

1300
00:53:11,567 --> 00:53:14,328
and don't know it try and use these devices

1301
00:53:14,328 --> 00:53:16,168
and don't get the same responses as others.

1302
00:53:16,717 --> 00:53:20,299
Yeah, so at the moment, we just have to collect data

1303
00:53:20,299 --> 00:53:22,080
from anyone who we can get data from

1304
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:25,422
and then start figuring out which aspects of it are reliable

1305
00:53:25,422 --> 00:53:26,422
and if there is something different

1306
00:53:26,422 --> 00:53:27,583
about some individual person.

1307
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:30,245
So that will likely come up as a consequence.

1308
00:53:30,245 --> 00:53:33,547
It's not something we're looking at directly at the moment.

1309
00:53:33,547 --> 00:53:37,189
And also that's gonna become important later on

1310
00:53:37,189 --> 00:53:39,010
when you're providing feedback to the player.

1311
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:40,391
So for each game, you may have to do a calibration

1312
00:53:40,391 --> 00:53:41,532
of the actual individual person.

1313
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:43,391
Yes, yeah, so absolutely.

1314
00:53:43,391 --> 00:53:46,292
Like what this actually looks like in practice, right?

1315
00:53:46,292 --> 00:53:49,714
Ideally we get to a point where players could play the game

1316
00:53:49,714 --> 00:53:52,816
without any changes on our end for a couple hours

1317
00:53:52,816 --> 00:53:55,297
or whatnot and we would get enough data to start making,

1318
00:53:55,297 --> 00:53:57,559
testing hypotheses about what they might like or don't like

1319
00:53:57,559 --> 00:53:59,059
or if they're feeling engaged or whatnot.

1320
00:53:59,059 --> 00:54:01,521
So, and maybe we'll get a lot better at it.

1321
00:54:01,521 --> 00:54:03,982
It can turn it into something that's five minutes

1322
00:54:03,982 --> 00:54:05,543
or half an hour.

1323
00:54:05,543 --> 00:54:07,284
But yeah, at the moment, I guess the way I see it is

1324
00:54:07,284 --> 00:54:09,145
we probably gather a fair bit of data at the beginning.

1325
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:10,466
Great.

1326
00:54:10,466 --> 00:54:10,566
Sure.

1327
00:54:12,108 --> 00:54:14,210
Nicole is from Xeo Design.

1328
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:15,751
And yeah, interesting talk.

1329
00:54:15,751 --> 00:54:18,474
I also am really interested in the opportunity

1330
00:54:18,474 --> 00:54:20,256
with VR and other sort of headsets,

1331
00:54:20,256 --> 00:54:23,159
just so we get more measurements up there.

1332
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:25,201
I was curious on the point, especially

1333
00:54:25,201 --> 00:54:29,485
about adaptive gameplay, why muck around with the skull

1334
00:54:29,485 --> 00:54:34,710
when you're looking at when emotions are so

1335
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:36,592
important to balancing?

1336
00:54:37,032 --> 00:54:41,456
if you've got even if you have frustration and you can measure it which we which we did you know 15

1337
00:54:41,456 --> 00:54:48,422
years ago the uh you know your your frustration curve some players play to get super cuphead

1338
00:54:48,422 --> 00:54:52,585
frustrated yes in order to feel the feeling of fierro yes i won because you can't push a button

1339
00:54:52,585 --> 00:54:52,985
and win yes

1340
00:54:53,946 --> 00:54:56,909
So just saying, whether they're being positive or negative,

1341
00:54:56,909 --> 00:54:58,951
we don't want to pull, if you pull all the negative out,

1342
00:54:58,951 --> 00:55:00,973
then there is no actually gameplay, it's flat.

1343
00:55:00,973 --> 00:55:02,134
They want to feel that emotion.

1344
00:55:02,134 --> 00:55:04,296
And so then going back to BCIs and EEGs,

1345
00:55:04,296 --> 00:55:06,418
you're really only measuring those systems,

1346
00:55:06,418 --> 00:55:07,519
the data is noisy, agree.

1347
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:09,641
But they also can only measure

1348
00:55:09,641 --> 00:55:11,583
the first quarter inch of activity,

1349
00:55:11,583 --> 00:55:14,526
which is all neocortex, where emotion happens

1350
00:55:14,526 --> 00:55:17,288
is in the deep brain, the hypothalamus,

1351
00:55:17,288 --> 00:55:18,810
the amygdala, and all that.

1352
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:23,092
It's wires, neurons, but it's also pipes, oxytocin, serotonin,

1353
00:55:23,092 --> 00:55:25,113
all of these chemicals.

1354
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:29,055
So I was curious, why are you so optimistic about BCIs

1355
00:55:29,055 --> 00:55:32,777
that are measuring from the external?

1356
00:55:32,777 --> 00:55:33,937
They're non-invasive.

1357
00:55:33,937 --> 00:55:37,079
When we could just measure facial expressions,

1358
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:39,140
like on your earlier slide, we used

1359
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:41,962
Pollackman's facial action coding for the four keys

1360
00:55:41,962 --> 00:55:43,803
to fun, which is our model on emotion

1361
00:55:43,803 --> 00:55:45,403
and how gameplay creates it.

1362
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:50,145
Yeah, so it may be that we can use webcams looking at somebody's face and get almost

1363
00:55:50,145 --> 00:55:52,126
everything we need.

1364
00:55:52,126 --> 00:55:56,349
I think the reason to think about BCIs is that we actually can get a little bit more,

1365
00:55:56,349 --> 00:55:58,431
I think, than we can get.

1366
00:55:58,431 --> 00:56:02,454
I think we can do a better job with emotions, even if we can't get deep into the brain,

1367
00:56:02,454 --> 00:56:06,436
although hopefully changes in imaging technology will kind of address that as well.

1368
00:56:06,436 --> 00:56:11,900
The purpose of the talk is not necessarily to say that BCIs, or what I was describing

1369
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:14,402
with EEGs, are definitely the way to go.

1370
00:56:14,622 --> 00:56:17,264
eye tracking and a webcam and a GSR sensor

1371
00:56:17,264 --> 00:56:19,566
might get you everything you need.

1372
00:56:19,566 --> 00:56:21,707
But if we are going to think long term,

1373
00:56:21,707 --> 00:56:23,468
and we are trying to think long term,

1374
00:56:23,468 --> 00:56:26,590
trying to understand what's possible and what we could get

1375
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:29,052
that would be more granular than what webcam will give us,

1376
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:32,134
it seems like EEGs, I guess, they

1377
00:56:32,134 --> 00:56:34,696
give us a lot of things and potentially a lot more.

1378
00:56:34,696 --> 00:56:37,277
Because there's hundreds of emotions,

1379
00:56:37,277 --> 00:56:37,998
not just three or four.

1380
00:56:38,292 --> 00:56:39,913
Yeah, we're absolutely not wedded to it.

1381
00:56:39,913 --> 00:56:41,494
It's more like, again, I had the one slide

1382
00:56:41,494 --> 00:56:42,495
about physiological signals.

1383
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:44,217
I mean, I'm speaking about BCI,

1384
00:56:44,217 --> 00:56:45,357
because we think in the long run,

1385
00:56:45,357 --> 00:56:47,159
that's where things will end up.

1386
00:56:47,159 --> 00:56:48,340
But maybe over the next five years,

1387
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:49,341
it's just webcams, and we get a lot from that.

1388
00:56:49,341 --> 00:56:52,083
Or you can also measure the microexpressions.

1389
00:56:52,083 --> 00:56:53,364
You could actually measure

1390
00:56:53,364 --> 00:56:55,066
the muscle contractions on the face.

1391
00:56:55,066 --> 00:56:56,447
Yeah, so that's with EMG and whatnot.

1392
00:56:56,447 --> 00:56:57,127
And if you have a VR headset,

1393
00:56:57,127 --> 00:56:58,869
you can have EMG sensors as well.

1394
00:56:58,869 --> 00:57:01,491
Yeah, so you get curiosity, surprise, anger, contempt,

1395
00:57:01,491 --> 00:57:03,593
a lot of stuff that's happening on muscles.

1396
00:57:03,593 --> 00:57:04,333
Yeah. Thank you.

1397
00:57:04,333 --> 00:57:04,513
Sure.

1398
00:57:05,697 --> 00:57:06,457
Hi, thanks.

1399
00:57:06,457 --> 00:57:06,978
Great talk.

1400
00:57:06,978 --> 00:57:14,545
So I do EEG and VR research just as part of my graduate program.

1401
00:57:14,545 --> 00:57:17,167
One of the problems that we have with just having

1402
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:21,572
VR be, well, EEG be a good control interface for VR

1403
00:57:21,572 --> 00:57:24,554
is to reliably classify just different trials in,

1404
00:57:24,554 --> 00:57:27,297
let's say, like an event-related potentials paradigm.

1405
00:57:27,297 --> 00:57:30,040
You have to average together a whole lot of trials.

1406
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:30,400
And

1407
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:35,243
while that brings user frustration down with regards to like trying to select

1408
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:38,084
like different objects, it then takes that control time up.

1409
00:57:38,084 --> 00:57:38,204
Yep.

1410
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:44,567
So is like Valve looking at any like solutions for that to help bring

1411
00:57:44,567 --> 00:57:51,531
the, not VR, bring EEG and VR together like in in the consumer space a little bit?

1412
00:57:52,049 --> 00:57:59,071
Yeah, so one hope we have, which is optimistic, is that if we had 100,000 samples of the same

1413
00:57:59,071 --> 00:58:03,613
person doing a task five times as opposed to one person doing a task 500 or 5,000 times,

1414
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:07,474
that we could overcome the issue that you're describing.

1415
00:58:07,474 --> 00:58:11,435
That may not be able to be the case, but the hope is that

1416
00:58:12,035 --> 00:58:14,596
by looking at how people are reliably reacting

1417
00:58:14,596 --> 00:58:17,017
to a variety of things and over time

1418
00:58:17,017 --> 00:58:18,337
and with large enough sample sizes

1419
00:58:18,337 --> 00:58:20,398
that we could start getting a picture.

1420
00:58:20,398 --> 00:58:21,559
And so we would start with, yeah,

1421
00:58:21,559 --> 00:58:23,159
so I think in the long run,

1422
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:24,380
we'd like to be able to eliminate that.

1423
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:25,820
At the moment, in the beginning, yeah,

1424
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:28,341
we realize that's a problem and we'll have to overcome it.

1425
00:58:28,341 --> 00:58:30,882
And the hope is that with enough samples, we will.

1426
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:32,142
But that might be naive.

1427
00:58:32,142 --> 00:58:34,003
Okay, all right, thank you. Sure.

1428
00:58:35,209 --> 00:58:44,491
Hi, I was wondering, you talked a lot about the adaptiveness of changing gameplay based on the actual physical emotional response.

1429
00:58:44,705 --> 00:58:46,527
But I was wondering, how far along is technology

1430
00:58:46,527 --> 00:58:49,429
in terms of actually controlling characters

1431
00:58:49,429 --> 00:58:52,270
within a game, such as telling someone to go forward and jump?

1432
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:53,892
How far along is that?

1433
00:58:53,892 --> 00:58:55,212
So it's right in the beginning.

1434
00:58:55,212 --> 00:58:59,976
So non-invasively, people have trained people using EG headsets

1435
00:58:59,976 --> 00:59:02,818
to play Tetris, for example.

1436
00:59:02,818 --> 00:59:06,260
It takes training and it takes work.

1437
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:09,642
So it is possible at the moment.

1438
00:59:09,642 --> 00:59:12,884
But actually doing complex navigation through a space,

1439
00:59:12,884 --> 00:59:13,825
we're not there yet.

1440
00:59:13,825 --> 00:59:14,025
But.

1441
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:18,608
And it may be that we eventually reach kind of like,

1442
00:59:18,608 --> 00:59:21,710
we come up against a fundamental limitation

1443
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:22,851
of what we can do outside the skull.

1444
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:24,432
And then it's like, well, we need to figure out a way to,

1445
00:59:24,432 --> 00:59:26,253
either we stop doing the research

1446
00:59:26,253 --> 00:59:27,894
or we figure out a way to provide a benefit

1447
00:59:27,894 --> 00:59:30,376
where people are willing to get implants.

1448
00:59:30,376 --> 00:59:30,856
Okay, cool.

1449
00:59:30,856 --> 00:59:31,016
Yep.

1450
00:59:31,016 --> 00:59:31,177
Thank you.

1451
00:59:31,177 --> 00:59:31,217
Oh.

1452
00:59:31,217 --> 00:59:34,259
I guess that's all I had time.

1453
00:59:34,259 --> 00:59:37,681
Yeah, I will, I guess we can go to like

1454
00:59:37,681 --> 00:59:39,782
one of the wrap up rooms over there.

1455
00:59:39,782 --> 00:59:40,523
So happy to chat with you.
