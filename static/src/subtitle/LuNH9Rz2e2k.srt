1
00:00:05,853 --> 00:00:06,354
All right, great.

2
00:00:07,114 --> 00:00:07,895
Welcome to GTC.

3
00:00:08,895 --> 00:00:10,997
And I have the unfortunate first session of today.

4
00:00:11,217 --> 00:00:12,597
My name is Jerry.

5
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:15,879
I am principal game designer at King Berlin.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,041
And today we'll be talking about level design saga,

7
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:20,942
creating levels for casual games.

8
00:00:20,962 --> 00:00:25,805
A little bit about me, principal game designer at King Berlin.

9
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:27,806
I'm working on a brand new saga game from King.

10
00:00:28,307 --> 00:00:29,788
Originally, I was from Singapore.

11
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:31,269
But two years ago, I decided that I

12
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:32,789
needed a little bit more gloom in my life.

13
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,131
So I moved to a pretty depressing but vibrant Berlin.

14
00:00:36,013 --> 00:00:40,957
I'm a lifelong passionate gamer, been gaming since I was six, the first game that I played was Super Mario Brothers,

15
00:00:41,638 --> 00:00:42,939
and I never stopped playing since then.

16
00:00:43,499 --> 00:00:45,401
I'm currently in my ninth year in the game industry,

17
00:00:45,881 --> 00:00:52,366
and I work in the different facets of this industry from startups to indie to academia, teaching game design to serious games to more

18
00:00:52,406 --> 00:00:54,228
traditional AAA companies like Konami.

19
00:00:55,789 --> 00:01:00,933
Work on games across different platforms, console to mobile for different markets, international and Asian markets both.

20
00:01:01,994 --> 00:01:09,593
What excites me is that currently I'm working on mobile games, and I think that mobile games is a space that it's a new frontier, and we're just barely scratching the surface of.

21
00:01:14,697 --> 00:01:18,578
Reasons why I decided to do this talk, because if you look out there in the articles and

22
00:01:18,598 --> 00:01:22,619
the books, there's quite a lot of material on game design, of how to formalize, how to

23
00:01:22,639 --> 00:01:26,040
formally talk about game design, but there's a little bit lesser material on level design.

24
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,142
And even if you find such material, a lot of it is more about core games than casual

25
00:01:31,162 --> 00:01:31,402
games.

26
00:01:31,462 --> 00:01:35,243
So I wanted to come in with a slant on how we design levels for casual games.

27
00:01:38,058 --> 00:01:40,240
Today's talk will cover four different sections.

28
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,541
I named them the four Ts.

29
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:43,803
Theory, an overview of what level design is.

30
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,185
Thought, the different level design principles

31
00:01:46,205 --> 00:01:47,627
that we think about when we're designing levels.

32
00:01:47,987 --> 00:01:50,869
Tools, how do we build levels in the saga.

33
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,292
And testing, how do we tweak and how do we tinker levels

34
00:01:54,312 --> 00:01:56,414
so that we optimize them to become perfect.

35
00:01:58,276 --> 00:02:00,417
So without further ado, let's start on the first section,

36
00:02:00,477 --> 00:02:00,758
theory.

37
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:06,860
If you look at these games, it's a big spread of games, from the original Super Mario Brothers

38
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,205
to GoldenEye to more modern hits like Halo or even Dark Souls.

39
00:02:12,126 --> 00:02:13,708
There's level design in all these games.

40
00:02:13,728 --> 00:02:18,094
These games all have levels and a lot of these are examples of what we term as good levels

41
00:02:18,134 --> 00:02:18,875
or good level design.

42
00:02:20,452 --> 00:02:24,253
What is level design in general? Level design is a composite role.

43
00:02:24,433 --> 00:02:26,954
It encompasses art, code, and design.

44
00:02:27,775 --> 00:02:29,335
And think of it like a funnel.

45
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:33,397
You put them together in a funnel, and you create levels.

46
00:02:34,898 --> 00:02:37,559
The difference between a game designer and a level designer is that

47
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,160
the game designer is more...

48
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,321
it creates the rules and the systems for the game.

49
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:46,473
But the level designer actually implements them into gameplay experiences.

50
00:02:47,114 --> 00:02:51,960
In our case, if everything goes right and all the stars align, good levels, fun levels

51
00:02:52,401 --> 00:02:55,685
lead to money in King.

52
00:02:56,966 --> 00:02:58,328
And yeah, money yay.

53
00:03:01,191 --> 00:03:03,173
A simple way to think of it is like building blocks.

54
00:03:03,793 --> 00:03:07,056
The game designer creates the blocks like in Lego, the building blocks, and the level

55
00:03:07,076 --> 00:03:10,979
designers are the people who put them together to form different structures like castles

56
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:13,641
or spaceships or pirate ships.

57
00:03:15,926 --> 00:03:18,647
in a more formal approach in the MDA framework,

58
00:03:18,988 --> 00:03:22,129
where it's proposed that game designers are on one end

59
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:24,971
creating mechanics, and the players are on the other end

60
00:03:25,311 --> 00:03:26,692
experiencing the aesthetic experience.

61
00:03:27,272 --> 00:03:29,113
What this model proposes is that the game designers

62
00:03:29,153 --> 00:03:32,035
create the mechanics, and when the mechanics run

63
00:03:32,055 --> 00:03:33,956
during run time, they create dynamic situations,

64
00:03:34,656 --> 00:03:38,839
and this leads to an aesthetic experience for the players,

65
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:40,540
or something that they feel, whether they feel fun,

66
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,381
whether they feel exploration or something.

67
00:03:43,141 --> 00:03:46,527
Where a level design sits, in my opinion, it sits somewhere here.

68
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:49,673
Where it's, again, coming back to the concept of a funnel,

69
00:03:50,194 --> 00:03:52,758
and it's funneling these dynamics into aesthetic experiences.

70
00:03:54,746 --> 00:03:59,747
To speak a little bit about level design at King, the role of a level designer in King

71
00:03:59,827 --> 00:04:02,628
generally encompasses designing levels and progressions of course.

72
00:04:03,328 --> 00:04:07,269
We create content at a regular pace, like that's probably once every one or two weeks

73
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:09,230
we release new levels.

74
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:13,411
Level designers are involved in creating new content as well, new power-ups, new blockers,

75
00:04:13,531 --> 00:04:18,973
new game modes, and because of the sheer number of levels that we need, game designers do

76
00:04:19,013 --> 00:04:19,613
level design too.

77
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,162
One thing that I like about King a lot is that there's good knowledge sharing in King.

78
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:27,764
We have our own internal app store where you can go in and you can download any of the

79
00:04:27,805 --> 00:04:29,646
other teams' work-in-progress games.

80
00:04:30,006 --> 00:04:33,408
You can play them, and it's easy, because of that, it's easy to start a discussion with

81
00:04:33,508 --> 00:04:37,730
any other designer during the regular meetups and the sharing sessions that we have.

82
00:04:42,053 --> 00:04:46,715
So, delving a little bit deeper into what makes good levels, this is the section about

83
00:04:46,755 --> 00:04:47,656
level design principles.

84
00:04:49,528 --> 00:04:51,730
One of the ways of how we approach building a saga,

85
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,231
and this is only one of the many ways,

86
00:04:53,932 --> 00:04:55,132
is it starts a bit like this.

87
00:04:55,453 --> 00:04:56,914
It starts, as with any other game idea,

88
00:04:56,954 --> 00:04:59,396
it starts with, hey, wouldn't it be cool if this or that?

89
00:04:59,816 --> 00:05:01,337
So it starts from a cool idea,

90
00:05:01,357 --> 00:05:03,859
and it goes to this platform.

91
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,882
It's less famous than our saga games.

92
00:05:08,022 --> 00:05:09,783
We have a website called royalgames.com,

93
00:05:10,323 --> 00:05:14,046
where it's a website where you can play browser-based games

94
00:05:14,066 --> 00:05:15,407
that last about three to five minutes,

95
00:05:15,987 --> 00:05:18,149
and mostly it's based on a set of simple mechanics.

96
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:22,659
We've picked, what happens normally is that, or what happens sometimes is that we pick

97
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:29,181
good games from royalgames.com and we apply the saga envelope on it and we create a saga,

98
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:30,101
like Candy Crush Saga.

99
00:05:31,442 --> 00:05:36,784
Some examples of some saga games that started this way, Diamond Digger or Bubble Witch,

100
00:05:37,044 --> 00:05:41,385
they had original versions of royalgames.com and they were transformed into saga games

101
00:05:41,445 --> 00:05:41,805
eventually.

102
00:05:44,487 --> 00:05:46,088
What does it mean to create a saga?

103
00:05:46,108 --> 00:05:49,010
It means, in King, we call this the saga envelope.

104
00:05:50,331 --> 00:05:52,732
Normally, a lot of you are probably familiar with this by now,

105
00:05:52,893 --> 00:05:54,574
but what it normally means, just for definition,

106
00:05:55,074 --> 00:05:56,315
some degree of linear progression.

107
00:05:56,675 --> 00:05:59,617
It starts from 100 and it goes to over 1000 levels for some games.

108
00:05:59,637 --> 00:06:01,698
Like if you look at the original Candy Crush or Farm Heroes,

109
00:06:02,018 --> 00:06:03,399
they have more than 1000 levels now.

110
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,701
There's new content every one or two weeks.

111
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:07,742
There's some light social elements,

112
00:06:07,862 --> 00:06:09,483
like being able to see your friends on the world map,

113
00:06:09,563 --> 00:06:11,244
being able to send your friend lives,

114
00:06:11,484 --> 00:06:12,945
and it's intended for a casual audience.

115
00:06:14,403 --> 00:06:19,206
What is really effective about the Saga envelope is that it's a strong progression-based retention

116
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:23,489
driver. Because there's new content released every one or two weeks, there are new levels

117
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:27,611
for players to play, the players are always coming back to see something different, to

118
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:31,433
see something new, whether it's new content or new levels. And because it's so effective,

119
00:06:31,473 --> 00:06:35,655
we apply this across the different King games, from Farm Hero Super Saga, to Blossom Blast,

120
00:06:36,536 --> 00:06:37,276
to Candy Crush Soda.

121
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,992
But what this means across King is that across all our games,

122
00:06:41,412 --> 00:06:43,333
we need a lot and a lot of levels.

123
00:06:43,514 --> 00:06:45,675
So the level design process, the building process,

124
00:06:45,735 --> 00:06:46,516
is super intensive.

125
00:06:48,757 --> 00:06:52,620
In King Berlin, one game that followed this model

126
00:06:52,981 --> 00:06:54,582
is this game from royalgames.com.

127
00:06:54,602 --> 00:06:55,382
It's called Lucky Lantern.

128
00:06:55,823 --> 00:06:57,164
It's a linker, and I'm going to show you

129
00:06:57,204 --> 00:06:59,485
a short video of the gameplay.

130
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:56,924
So, to better explain what was going on in the video, basically the game is a linker.

131
00:07:57,225 --> 00:07:59,086
You link three or more lanterns to remove them.

132
00:07:59,426 --> 00:08:01,568
One special feature about the game is creating dragons.

133
00:08:01,628 --> 00:08:04,971
When you link six or more lanterns, you create a dragon.

134
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:07,493
And the dragon flies in the direction of your last link.

135
00:08:08,374 --> 00:08:13,298
You can activate bombs and rockets by linking to them, which will fire after the refill

136
00:08:13,798 --> 00:08:14,599
for cascade effects.

137
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,242
And you can collect coins by bringing them to the bottom.

138
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:20,439
or hitting them with power-ups.

139
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,799
The objective of the game is to score a higher score than your opponent.

140
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,780
So bearing that in mind, the next question is that how do we start or where do we even

141
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,741
start designing levels?

142
00:08:32,861 --> 00:08:35,661
This is what the typical level design process in King looks like.

143
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,762
It starts from a level concept, of course.

144
00:08:38,422 --> 00:08:39,242
It starts with a good idea.

145
00:08:39,262 --> 00:08:40,562
How do you make an interesting level?

146
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:44,323
You go on to do a level layout, how to fit this idea into the board.

147
00:08:45,143 --> 00:08:46,503
You create a level in the level editor.

148
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:49,910
Once you think it's ready, you test it a little bit and you balance it.

149
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,652
You think that, okay, it's ready, and then you send it out for real testing.

150
00:08:53,272 --> 00:08:54,953
And because we're running live games,

151
00:08:55,053 --> 00:08:59,135
very often the loop of testing and balancing goes on forever.

152
00:09:02,164 --> 00:09:06,145
A good place to start is breaking the game down into different kind of building blocks.

153
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:11,207
So, like in the case of Lucky Lantern, you can think of it as breaking it down into four

154
00:09:11,227 --> 00:09:11,807
different blocks.

155
00:09:12,087 --> 00:09:16,469
Like game mechanics, the basic linking, activating power-ups, creating dragons, collecting coins.

156
00:09:17,469 --> 00:09:22,451
Because it's a simple three to five minute browser game, there's only one game mode, which is getting a high score to beat your opponent.

157
00:09:22,911 --> 00:09:25,251
The gameplay elements in the game, lanterns, rockets,

158
00:09:26,012 --> 00:09:32,573
bombs, coins, and the blockers, things that make, that add some challenge to block the players from achieving their goal,

159
00:09:32,974 --> 00:09:35,834
clouds, and arguably coins, because sometimes they get in the way as well.

160
00:09:38,575 --> 00:09:43,036
If you use the same model to analyze one of our other games, this is from Candy Crush Soda.

161
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:47,951
So the game mechanics in Candy Crush Soda, like basic swapping, creating power-ups by

162
00:09:47,991 --> 00:09:50,313
creating matches of four or five, for example.

163
00:09:50,793 --> 00:09:53,095
Power-up combos when you match two power-ups together.

164
00:09:53,755 --> 00:09:56,998
Or if you're late enough in the game, there are helpers as well, like Sprinkle Shell.

165
00:09:57,378 --> 00:09:57,978
I think past level 250.

166
00:09:58,018 --> 00:10:02,021
The game modes, a lot of different game modes we have in Candy Crush Soda.

167
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:06,164
Pop the bottles, find the bears, clear the chocolate, clear the bubblegum, spread the

168
00:10:06,204 --> 00:10:06,504
jam.

169
00:10:07,305 --> 00:10:08,146
The gameplay elements.

170
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:12,008
You have candies, you have the power-ups, you have the walls, you have the holes, things

171
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,129
that you can use to build a board.

172
00:10:13,872 --> 00:10:18,915
Like blockers, many many different blockers in the game, like ice or frosting, licorice logs,

173
00:10:19,555 --> 00:10:22,357
cupcakes, honey, licorice swirl, the list goes on.

174
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:26,959
And because Candy Crush Soda is such a big game, we also have what I like to term modifiers,

175
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:29,961
things that we put on top of some levels to add a little bit of spice.

176
00:10:30,341 --> 00:10:34,103
Things like the soda physics, for example, or the gravity, or the multiple gravity directions,

177
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,685
or multiple screens, or scrolling screens as well.

178
00:10:39,114 --> 00:10:42,496
So, once you know your game and once you've broken it down into the different elements,

179
00:10:43,157 --> 00:10:44,738
the next step is to build levels.

180
00:10:45,118 --> 00:10:50,762
And when we're talking about levels, these are four concepts that I adapted from this

181
00:10:51,022 --> 00:10:52,943
book called Game Level Design by Ed Byrne.

182
00:10:54,264 --> 00:10:58,047
The four different concepts, the first one is difficulty, how to keep players challenged

183
00:10:58,067 --> 00:10:58,487
in the level.

184
00:10:59,148 --> 00:10:59,388
Rhythm.

185
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:02,312
how to vary the player experience across the game,

186
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,493
flow, how to keep players moving towards the goal,

187
00:11:06,093 --> 00:11:09,214
and hooks, how to make one level different from the other.

188
00:11:11,615 --> 00:11:14,236
But what you need to keep in mind for our case

189
00:11:14,276 --> 00:11:16,797
particularly is that we are creating mobile games.

190
00:11:17,157 --> 00:11:19,138
One thing that we use quite often in King

191
00:11:19,238 --> 00:11:20,719
is that we are creating games that

192
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:23,179
have this bite-sized brilliance.

193
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,881
This means that our players engage with our games in.

194
00:11:28,322 --> 00:11:30,383
situations that are different from the normal call game.

195
00:11:30,784 --> 00:11:33,606
Like it could be on the train, it could be when they're waiting for

196
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:36,348
a plane on the airport, it could be a mother babysitting

197
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:39,191
her child while playing Candy Crush with her other free hand,

198
00:11:39,671 --> 00:11:42,674
or it could be friends at the dining table playing this over lunch.

199
00:11:44,235 --> 00:11:48,078
So, the idea is that we're going to look at these concepts and how we translate them

200
00:11:48,238 --> 00:11:48,478
to

201
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:49,800
the mobile format.

202
00:11:52,534 --> 00:11:56,637
A good place to start of what makes an interesting level would be starting with a hook.

203
00:11:57,357 --> 00:12:01,820
A hook is defined as a unique element that makes a level different from other levels

204
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,260
in the game.

205
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,481
And it could be anything.

206
00:12:03,521 --> 00:12:04,722
It could be this twist.

207
00:12:04,782 --> 00:12:07,723
It could be a special power, it could be a different gameplay style, it could be a different

208
00:12:07,784 --> 00:12:09,284
environment, a different art style.

209
00:12:09,745 --> 00:12:11,106
Anything that makes the level unique.

210
00:12:11,126 --> 00:12:17,229
If you look at some of these examples in traditional games, for example, in the first one here,

211
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,691
in Cakewalk Flip in Super Mario 3D World.

212
00:12:21,414 --> 00:12:25,757
The hook here is that every time that the player jumps, the panels switch from red to blue.

213
00:12:25,957 --> 00:12:28,178
And this gives you different platforms to jump to.

214
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:31,941
Over here, Shadow of the Colossus. How many of you have played this game?

215
00:12:33,622 --> 00:12:34,963
Yep, great game. One of my favourites.

216
00:12:36,364 --> 00:12:40,247
The whole game, as you know, is about 16 different boss fights,

217
00:12:40,287 --> 00:12:41,968
by each boss having a different hook,

218
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:45,571
where you need to use a different set of mechanics or tactics to actually beat the boss.

219
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:46,752
This level?

220
00:12:47,553 --> 00:12:48,553
Everybody knows what this game is?

221
00:12:51,954 --> 00:12:55,819
Yep, Half-Life 2, Ravenholm, one of my favourite levels in Half-Life 2, where the hook is,

222
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:59,543
you start the level and you almost have no other gun, except the gravity gun and most

223
00:12:59,563 --> 00:13:04,149
of the level you have to go through only using the gravity gun to get to the level.

224
00:13:05,123 --> 00:13:08,446
And this is from Bayonetta 2, where earlier in this year's

225
00:13:08,486 --> 00:13:10,968
GDC, in Abbasan when he was talking about creating levels

226
00:13:11,028 --> 00:13:13,751
for Bayonetta, one starting point of which they had

227
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,713
was to start thinking about scenarios.

228
00:13:16,153 --> 00:13:18,435
What kind of scenarios or what kind of action scenarios

229
00:13:18,475 --> 00:13:20,637
that is interesting for Bayonetta to be in,

230
00:13:20,998 --> 00:13:22,919
and then designing the levels and the spaces

231
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,080
and the narrative around that.

232
00:13:26,503 --> 00:13:28,404
So how does this translate to our games?

233
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,681
We start from level concept.

234
00:13:30,781 --> 00:13:33,383
So if you look at, one way to think about it is how,

235
00:13:33,783 --> 00:13:36,305
one starting point is that how do we utilize a mechanic?

236
00:13:37,085 --> 00:13:39,847
How do we utilize a mechanic in an interesting or a new way?

237
00:13:40,628 --> 00:13:43,910
Any of you know or have played this game, Blossom Blast Saga?

238
00:13:45,571 --> 00:13:48,353
Yeah, so for the people who haven't played this game,

239
00:13:48,433 --> 00:13:50,014
Blossom Blast Saga is a linker as well.

240
00:13:51,719 --> 00:13:56,483
The main thing about the game is that the longer your link is, or if you make your link

241
00:13:56,523 --> 00:14:02,807
powerful enough, it triggers a blossom blast, which is a chain reaction that triggers everything

242
00:14:02,887 --> 00:14:03,047
else.

243
00:14:03,648 --> 00:14:08,511
So in this level, particularly, we focus on that mechanic, and the idea is that you only

244
00:14:08,531 --> 00:14:11,113
have one objective, which is to clear this weed in the middle.

245
00:14:12,194 --> 00:14:16,437
So the player needs to set the board up so that it comes to this situation, where they

246
00:14:16,457 --> 00:14:20,680
can trigger a blossom blast close enough to the weed, and then when they do it...

247
00:14:22,464 --> 00:14:26,046
trigger the blossom blast and they clear the weed. So this is a level that's focused on

248
00:14:26,206 --> 00:14:30,689
utilizing that one mechanic in a different or very specialized way. That's one level concept.

249
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,931
Another way to think about it is another way to come up with interesting levels is

250
00:14:35,212 --> 00:14:39,254
what happens if you combine different elements in the game to form new gameplay dynamics.

251
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:45,918
This is a screenshot from Candy Crush Jelly. Candy Crush Jelly is our latest Candy Crush game that

252
00:14:47,065 --> 00:14:48,966
One of the new features is that it has a jelly queen.

253
00:14:49,026 --> 00:14:51,727
A jelly queen is an AI-controlled character

254
00:14:51,747 --> 00:14:53,428
that every time after you make a turn,

255
00:14:53,448 --> 00:14:55,789
the jelly queen makes a turn and spreads the green jelly.

256
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:58,310
So the objective is to spread enough of the red jelly

257
00:14:59,171 --> 00:14:59,671
over the board.

258
00:15:00,832 --> 00:15:02,252
So this is introduced early in the game.

259
00:15:02,773 --> 00:15:07,315
But what happens later is that we introduce this same element

260
00:15:07,355 --> 00:15:09,796
and we combine it with another game mode that was introduced

261
00:15:10,256 --> 00:15:11,837
before this, the pufflers.

262
00:15:12,397 --> 00:15:13,758
The pufflers are a game mode where

263
00:15:13,778 --> 00:15:16,620
they run around in the frosting below and you need to find them.

264
00:15:17,765 --> 00:15:21,706
But the new gameplay dynamic here is that we took the AI of the jelly queen,

265
00:15:22,306 --> 00:15:23,987
and we put it with find a puffler.

266
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,387
So you're fighting this guy instead, called Cupcake Cow,

267
00:15:26,487 --> 00:15:28,808
one of the most hated characters in the whole Candy universe.

268
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:33,130
And you need to compete against him to find these guys.

269
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,671
So this is an example of how we combine different mechanics

270
00:15:36,711 --> 00:15:39,371
to form new situations or form new level dynamics.

271
00:15:40,887 --> 00:15:44,768
Sometimes it starts with, sometimes the idea is to create an emotional wow moment.

272
00:15:45,328 --> 00:15:49,609
Like in this case, again, in Candy Crush Jelly, you look at this board layout, what happens

273
00:15:49,669 --> 00:15:53,230
here is that there's only one move you can do in the first turn, which is to combine

274
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:57,251
the chocolate bomb with the orange candy, and when you actually do that, it triggers

275
00:15:57,271 --> 00:16:00,692
a chain reaction of all the other striped orange candies at the bottom and blows up

276
00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:02,913
like vertical blasts to the rest of the board.

277
00:16:03,113 --> 00:16:07,334
And it's this feeling of wow that starts the level, and the whole level carries on with

278
00:16:07,374 --> 00:16:08,475
just building on power-ups.

279
00:16:10,853 --> 00:16:15,555
Or coming back to the idea of gameplay modifiers, this is a screenshot from Farm Heroes Super

280
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:15,895
Saga.

281
00:16:16,535 --> 00:16:19,456
One of the new modifiers that we had in the game is the wind direction.

282
00:16:19,956 --> 00:16:25,458
The pieces fall according to the direction of a match, and that's the modifier of this.

283
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:27,018
This is the first level that's introduced.

284
00:16:27,038 --> 00:16:32,620
When you match the banana to the right, the pieces will fly to the right instead.

285
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,661
So this is a situation where you think of a modifier and you apply it on a normal level.

286
00:16:38,647 --> 00:16:41,868
So these are all good starting points of how to create an interesting level.

287
00:16:43,688 --> 00:16:48,290
The next step is that once you have the concept, the next step is thinking about how do you

288
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,210
put it onto the board.

289
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:55,253
What kind of board layout would be interesting for you or for this concept to be realised.

290
00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:57,673
So this is an example of all my sketches.

291
00:16:57,713 --> 00:17:00,114
For example, I do this on paper first.

292
00:17:02,538 --> 00:17:06,821
My personal pro tip, super useful in meetings, when everybody else is talking and you don't

293
00:17:06,841 --> 00:17:09,322
want to pay attention, that's the best use of your time that you can have.

294
00:17:13,425 --> 00:17:13,965
So you're ready.

295
00:17:14,145 --> 00:17:17,187
So you think that, okay, I have a cool level concept, right?

296
00:17:17,467 --> 00:17:20,489
And then I have a layout, I'm all ready to build a level, it's going to be fun.

297
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:24,391
So you go to the level editor, and the process looks a little bit, a simplified version of

298
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:25,652
the process looks a little bit like this.

299
00:17:26,532 --> 00:17:29,794
You translate the level layout from paper onto the board.

300
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:34,171
You place your objectives, for example, clear the ice or whatever.

301
00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:40,275
You place your game objects, so you put like, okay, like all these objects, all these power-ups

302
00:17:40,315 --> 00:17:40,835
onto the board.

303
00:17:41,555 --> 00:17:45,718
You place your blockers, clouds for example, or something to get in the way of the challenge,

304
00:17:45,938 --> 00:17:50,380
and then you run the level and you think that, okay, it's going to be awesome, it's going

305
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:50,740
to be cool.

306
00:17:52,148 --> 00:17:53,249
But most of the time it's not the case.

307
00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:55,592
Everything falls apart at this point when you press run.

308
00:17:56,253 --> 00:17:57,134
Why is this the case?

309
00:17:57,314 --> 00:17:59,256
Why is it that everything that I thought in my mind

310
00:17:59,276 --> 00:18:00,678
up to this point, why does it break?

311
00:18:00,698 --> 00:18:04,062
It's because finding the fun in the level is not that easy.

312
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:06,064
It's not just about one concept.

313
00:18:06,205 --> 00:18:07,266
It's not just about one layout.

314
00:18:08,442 --> 00:18:11,864
The moment you start combining things together, you're opening the gameplay possibility space.

315
00:18:12,305 --> 00:18:17,089
And this is where we tread into the realm of experimental gameplay dynamics.

316
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:22,993
One term that is mentioned over and over again in level design is this term called moment-to-moment

317
00:18:23,013 --> 00:18:23,454
gameplay.

318
00:18:23,514 --> 00:18:27,117
What happens from one moment to the other moment as the player is playing through the

319
00:18:27,137 --> 00:18:27,377
level?

320
00:18:27,977 --> 00:18:32,661
In our case, because most of our games are turn-based, I like to term this as our turn-to-turn

321
00:18:32,681 --> 00:18:33,062
gameplay.

322
00:18:33,882 --> 00:18:35,904
And this is where the concept of level flow comes in.

323
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:38,791
So flow.

324
00:18:40,111 --> 00:18:42,212
The concept of level flow is the concept

325
00:18:42,572 --> 00:18:45,074
of how to keep players moving forward towards the goal.

326
00:18:45,494 --> 00:18:47,975
In traditional games, you use concepts like signposting,

327
00:18:48,035 --> 00:18:50,696
like goals and sub-goals, or some sort of hint system.

328
00:18:51,357 --> 00:18:54,418
What Edburns says in his book is that the level designer

329
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:57,319
is the invisible hand that guides the players forward.

330
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,841
But the more aware that the players are of this hand,

331
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:00,901
the less fun that it will be.

332
00:19:01,761 --> 00:19:02,882
So this is a little bit of a paradox.

333
00:19:04,804 --> 00:19:08,845
An example of level flow in one of our games, again coming back to Candy Crush Soda,

334
00:19:08,865 --> 00:19:11,326
if you look at this, this is how the board starts.

335
00:19:11,386 --> 00:19:13,987
There's only one possible move, which is to create a match of six.

336
00:19:14,307 --> 00:19:16,047
In Candy Crush Soda, if you're familiar with the mechanics,

337
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:18,988
when you create a match of more than five or six, for example,

338
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,269
you create this thing, the color converter.

339
00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:28,233
So in turn two, you actually activate the color converter with the green one, and this

340
00:19:28,273 --> 00:19:30,875
colors all the candies of another color to become green.

341
00:19:31,456 --> 00:19:36,841
In this case, what happens here is that all the orange candies become green, and a series

342
00:19:36,901 --> 00:19:40,344
of matches and cascades, and then this becomes the board state after that, which creates

343
00:19:40,364 --> 00:19:42,065
a new power-up for you, which is the chocolate bomb.

344
00:19:43,447 --> 00:19:46,109
And then when the player, in the third turn, when the player activates the chocolate bomb...

345
00:19:46,731 --> 00:19:50,163
it clears all the green again and it opens up new possibilities.

346
00:19:50,825 --> 00:19:53,574
And you can see that what happens here in the fourth or the fifth turn is that...

347
00:19:54,251 --> 00:19:58,774
The player can now move on, like many power-ups on the board, and the player can choose how

348
00:19:58,814 --> 00:20:02,856
he wants to engage the board at this point, whether he wants to go for the fish first,

349
00:20:02,876 --> 00:20:06,459
whether he wants to go for the striped candy, or whether he wants to match the chocolate

350
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:06,699
bomb.

351
00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:13,523
The idea is that it starts from a linear one possible move, and it opens up slowly, so

352
00:20:13,563 --> 00:20:17,045
the players are guided slowly along by this invisible hand that we're talking about.

353
00:20:19,155 --> 00:20:21,296
The main idea is that you want to move the players forward.

354
00:20:21,336 --> 00:20:25,558
You want to give them choice, or at least some illusion of choice, that they have something

355
00:20:25,578 --> 00:20:26,599
that they can do in the game.

356
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:30,060
But the main thing is that you're still trying to push them forward as much as you can.

357
00:20:32,461 --> 00:20:35,883
How we do this in our game, one example, is coming back to this level.

358
00:20:36,323 --> 00:20:38,844
So if you look at the level, this is the layout that you see.

359
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,045
The level is pretty straightforward.

360
00:20:41,285 --> 00:20:45,767
If you link these three, you activate this line blast, which will hit this, and will

361
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:48,248
trigger all these things, which triggers a cascade effect.

362
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:51,872
So this is the first turn, and the first turn we're building towards a wow moment, that

363
00:20:51,892 --> 00:20:54,974
feels cool, that's like, okay, it triggers all these things, it feels really great, right?

364
00:20:55,694 --> 00:20:59,036
But how do we try to engineer some degree of level flow after that?

365
00:20:59,116 --> 00:21:03,058
If you look at this, if you remove the clouds, and you look at what's happening behind, we

366
00:21:03,098 --> 00:21:05,019
have these pieces, which has these question marks.

367
00:21:05,855 --> 00:21:11,419
These pieces are pieces which have a probability of, during spawning, of being a power-up.

368
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:14,481
I think in this case, we tried 30%.

369
00:21:15,122 --> 00:21:18,724
So imagine all these pieces with question marks have a 30% chance of being a power-up.

370
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:22,727
What we're actually doing here is so that after the first turn, when you clear the clouds,

371
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:28,231
some of these will be power-ups, will open up so that you can go ahead to work towards

372
00:21:28,251 --> 00:21:29,072
the next sub-goal.

373
00:21:30,212 --> 00:21:33,014
This is one of the ways that we try to move the players forward.

374
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:39,315
But again, because we're creating a casual game and players engage our games in the most casual manner,

375
00:21:39,815 --> 00:21:42,578
sometimes all these subtle hints fail.

376
00:21:42,918 --> 00:21:45,040
And when that happens, the next thing we can do,

377
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,623
or the best thing we can do, is to introduce the hand of God.

378
00:21:49,364 --> 00:21:52,687
In our case, that's the hint system.

379
00:21:53,308 --> 00:21:56,470
Which is to, yeah, highlight super obvious moves like,

380
00:21:56,491 --> 00:21:59,553
hey, over here, move, so that the players keep moving forward.

381
00:22:04,112 --> 00:22:06,792
All right, so after that point, we are creating,

382
00:22:06,832 --> 00:22:08,513
we're talking about creating interesting levels,

383
00:22:08,573 --> 00:22:09,773
about how to move the players forward.

384
00:22:10,153 --> 00:22:11,754
But once you have a set of good levels,

385
00:22:11,954 --> 00:22:14,634
the next step is to put them together into a saga.

386
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:19,636
So this is an example of what an episode

387
00:22:19,816 --> 00:22:22,196
in Candy Crush Jelly looks like in our level editor.

388
00:22:23,457 --> 00:22:25,117
You can see all the levels laid out.

389
00:22:25,817 --> 00:22:27,958
Yeah, don't look at that, don't trust the numbers here.

390
00:22:27,978 --> 00:22:30,078
All of them are not difficulty zero.

391
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:34,674
but it's just that way in the level editor, and it's in this layout so that we can move

392
00:22:34,694 --> 00:22:38,158
them around, we can shuffle them around to create a different one, to create different

393
00:22:38,178 --> 00:22:38,598
progressions.

394
00:22:40,921 --> 00:22:43,744
One important thing to think about, about creating progressions, is that we want to

395
00:22:43,804 --> 00:22:45,446
create a rollercoaster experience.

396
00:22:45,466 --> 00:22:48,429
It needs to have highs, it needs to have lows, it needs to have twists, it needs to have

397
00:22:48,489 --> 00:22:50,691
turns, even in one episode itself.

398
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,561
And this is where I want to introduce the concept of rhythm.

399
00:22:54,281 --> 00:22:56,963
Rhythm is a way of expressing the pattern, the frequency,

400
00:22:57,103 --> 00:22:59,664
and the intensity of the sequences of events in the level.

401
00:23:00,465 --> 00:23:01,925
And the main purpose is to create

402
00:23:01,985 --> 00:23:03,546
some degree of variety in the player

403
00:23:03,586 --> 00:23:06,728
so that you give them some emotional journey that keeps

404
00:23:06,768 --> 00:23:07,889
players engaged in the game.

405
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:14,652
Ideally, a progression curve should

406
00:23:14,672 --> 00:23:17,034
look a little bit like this, the x-axis showing time

407
00:23:17,154 --> 00:23:19,875
and the y-axis showing the intensity of the experience.

408
00:23:20,575 --> 00:23:21,716
It shouldn't be a straight line.

409
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:25,497
You want to ramp up the intensity as the player goes along, but you want it to be like this,

410
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:27,378
where there are highs and there are lows along the way.

411
00:23:27,978 --> 00:23:31,059
Particularly in our case, we use different factors to do this.

412
00:23:31,199 --> 00:23:35,761
Things like different game modes, things like hard versus easy levels, short or long levels,

413
00:23:35,901 --> 00:23:38,962
or even how often do we introduce new content to break the monotony.

414
00:23:42,877 --> 00:23:44,737
One thing that's super useful for us is this,

415
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,238
having level libraries and having beat charts.

416
00:23:47,678 --> 00:23:49,639
So this is an example of one of our level libraries

417
00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:51,739
where you can see that it's an Excel sheet

418
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,480
that has all the levels listed.

419
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,341
It shows you all the different game modes

420
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:59,022
and this is the permutation of all the different blockers

421
00:23:59,042 --> 00:24:00,042
that we use for the level.

422
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:03,651
What is super convenient here is that because we have this in an overview,

423
00:24:03,971 --> 00:24:07,913
and we are creating a progression, for example, let's say it's about blocker X, it's about clouds,

424
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:11,175
then we can think about, we can look for, okay, we need a level with clouds,

425
00:24:11,195 --> 00:24:13,536
we need a level with clouds in this game mode, or we need a level when

426
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:16,078
clouds are combined with another blocker, for example.

427
00:24:16,098 --> 00:24:19,840
This gives us an easy overview that we can just copy and paste into a beat chart,

428
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:24,782
so that we can play this out, and easily create progressions in our minds, at least, or at least on paper,

429
00:24:25,843 --> 00:24:28,965
before we actually physically go and put it out in testing.

430
00:24:32,112 --> 00:24:36,252
Another concept when talking about progression is this concept made famous by Nintendo, the

431
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:40,753
four-panel Japanese comic concept called Kishoten Ketsu.

432
00:24:40,993 --> 00:24:44,774
It's because it's Japanese, it's read this way, from the right to left.

433
00:24:46,274 --> 00:24:52,395
Basically it means to introduce, to train, to twist, and to conclude, or to test.

434
00:24:54,296 --> 00:24:59,097
Nintendo uses this in their games super often, and one of the best examples is this, one

435
00:24:59,137 --> 00:25:00,917
of the best games ever in Super Mario 3D World.

436
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:03,723
I'm going to show you a short video of this swell.

437
00:25:30,587 --> 00:25:34,368
and here you'll have to deal with the flipping panels as you climb up the cliff face.

438
00:25:35,808 --> 00:25:36,948
Then comes the twist.

439
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:40,850
Towards the end of each stage, the concept is turned on its head in some way

440
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:45,011
to either challenge your mastery or to make you think about it from a fresh perspective.

441
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:47,652
In this case, we have to deal with the flip panels

442
00:25:47,752 --> 00:25:50,433
while also dodging the blast radius of this bumper enemy

443
00:25:50,573 --> 00:25:52,393
which we fought a little earlier in the stage.

444
00:25:52,813 --> 00:25:54,414
And finally, we get the conclusion.

445
00:25:54,654 --> 00:25:57,515
Each level gives you one last chance to show off your skills

446
00:25:57,815 --> 00:25:59,615
with a suitable flagpole sequence.

447
00:26:05,005 --> 00:26:09,392
Yep, so that was a video taken from this website called, this YouTube channel called Game Maker's Toolkit

448
00:26:09,532 --> 00:26:11,535
that shows the application of that principle.

449
00:26:12,176 --> 00:26:15,501
And now I want to talk about how we apply that principle in one of our games.

450
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:21,634
Coming back to Blossom Blast Saga, this is the first time this new game was introduced.

451
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:25,136
Unfortunately, named Bloom the Big Buds.

452
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:31,061
So, what you actually have to do here is that you need to link flowers of a certain colour

453
00:26:31,201 --> 00:26:37,025
into this big bud, and you need to link enough so that you bloom it.

454
00:26:37,966 --> 00:26:42,549
It's first introduced in this, and then it's trained in a later level, where it's the same

455
00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:45,151
concept, but you need to work your way down to it so that you can do that.

456
00:26:46,351 --> 00:26:50,897
And the twist happens when we combine this with one of the other blockers, the glass

457
00:26:50,937 --> 00:26:51,278
blocker.

458
00:26:51,719 --> 00:26:54,863
The glass blocker behaves like a lock, where you cannot link into it from the start.

459
00:26:54,963 --> 00:26:59,509
You cannot link from it from the start, but you have to link into it, and you can destroy

460
00:26:59,569 --> 00:27:02,033
it by blooming chain reactions or blossom blasts.

461
00:27:02,842 --> 00:27:07,505
What happens here is that the big buds, when you bloom, they actually crack the glass.

462
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:11,227
So it's a new use for the big buds when you combine them with this new blocker.

463
00:27:11,287 --> 00:27:11,867
So that's a twist.

464
00:27:12,507 --> 00:27:16,389
And then in level 20, you see a level that looks a little bit like this, which is just

465
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:20,772
half of the board are these buds, and you need to bloom all of them in...

466
00:27:22,092 --> 00:27:23,413
How many turns was that?

467
00:27:23,693 --> 00:27:23,933
39 turns.

468
00:27:23,953 --> 00:27:24,894
Yeah, this was a pretty tough level.

469
00:27:27,682 --> 00:27:32,424
Same thing for our game. Coming back to the example of Lucky Lantern, we create a dragon by,

470
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:38,366
like in our case we reduced it to five. So these are the board layouts for how we introduce the dragon concept.

471
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,787
This is the first level where you introduce, where you see the dragon.

472
00:27:41,107 --> 00:27:43,088
You create a link of five and then it clears the clouds.

473
00:27:43,468 --> 00:27:47,609
And you realize that the level is super linear. You can only create links of five as you go along,

474
00:27:48,189 --> 00:27:50,090
and you will clear more and more stuff as you go along.

475
00:27:50,832 --> 00:27:54,955
We train this in the next level, where you're creating, you start the level by creating

476
00:27:55,015 --> 00:27:59,458
a dragon, again, but what happens here is that you're creating it naturally as you play.

477
00:27:59,478 --> 00:28:04,942
The objective is to clear the ice, and you create it naturally as you play, and you need

478
00:28:04,962 --> 00:28:08,624
to kind of hit these things in the middle, but you don't really, really, really need

479
00:28:08,664 --> 00:28:12,087
it as well, because you can luck out with, like, a match here, for example.

480
00:28:13,808 --> 00:28:18,591
And then we twist it here, in this concept, where you need to use it to hit this particular

481
00:28:19,012 --> 00:28:19,572
block in the middle.

482
00:28:20,271 --> 00:28:24,772
But at the same time, we are combining this with another gameplay element that we introduced earlier on,

483
00:28:25,252 --> 00:28:28,833
where creating a longer link creates some sort of super power-up,

484
00:28:29,393 --> 00:28:31,574
and you need to use that to clear the outer area.

485
00:28:32,374 --> 00:28:35,375
And then in this level, we test all the concepts that you learned previously,

486
00:28:35,415 --> 00:28:39,896
where you need to use the dragon, you need to use the power-ups, and into a conclusion here.

487
00:28:44,885 --> 00:28:48,688
So, that is what, now we are at the last section, which is about testing.

488
00:28:50,268 --> 00:28:53,991
After creating a series of levels, putting them together in some sort of progression,

489
00:28:54,331 --> 00:28:58,833
putting them, laying them out, the next step to do is to test them and to tweak them.

490
00:29:00,054 --> 00:29:01,935
And this is where the concept of difficulty comes in.

491
00:29:02,035 --> 00:29:06,738
Difficulty is easy to explain, it's what keeps players challenged in the level.

492
00:29:07,498 --> 00:29:10,480
It's a level design tool that encompasses both rhythm and flow.

493
00:29:12,499 --> 00:29:15,962
by every game has a difficulty curve, because every level is a point in that curve,

494
00:29:16,162 --> 00:29:18,904
and your game becomes hard or easy depending on all your levels within.

495
00:29:21,265 --> 00:29:23,147
When you talk about difficulty, you have to talk about balancing.

496
00:29:24,187 --> 00:29:26,149
It means different things for different games. For our case,

497
00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:27,790
for example, in Candy Crush Soda,

498
00:29:28,551 --> 00:29:31,853
some of the obvious things that we use to balance a level to become easier or harder,

499
00:29:32,093 --> 00:29:33,414
things like number of objectives,

500
00:29:33,854 --> 00:29:37,137
so like how many you need to hit, how many bottles you need to pop, for example,

501
00:29:37,457 --> 00:29:38,598
the number of moves you have,

502
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:41,980
or for the people who want to go for 3-star, what are the 3-star values.

503
00:29:43,601 --> 00:29:47,224
But more subtly, some of the things that we do to make the gameplay easier or harder,

504
00:29:47,544 --> 00:29:51,888
things like number of blockers on the board, for example, the level and the number of blockers

505
00:29:51,928 --> 00:29:56,032
on the board, or something even more subtle, which is the number of colours available on

506
00:29:56,072 --> 00:30:01,136
the board, because more colours means that the chances of you cascading or forming power-ups

507
00:30:01,276 --> 00:30:01,636
is less.

508
00:30:02,057 --> 00:30:06,180
So if you want to make the level easier mechanically, one of the things you can do is to actually

509
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,382
reduce the number of colours available on the board.

510
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,606
Of course, when you talk about difficulty, one of the concepts that comes to mind is flow theory,

511
00:30:15,787 --> 00:30:18,812
made famous by Genova Chun in one of his earlier games, Flow,

512
00:30:19,633 --> 00:30:21,516
where he experimented with showing that in games.

513
00:30:22,478 --> 00:30:25,222
The concept of flow theory is something that states that...

514
00:30:26,097 --> 00:30:30,821
Optimally, you want your players to be here, within flow, where their abilities actually

515
00:30:30,881 --> 00:30:32,402
meet the challenge that they are presented.

516
00:30:32,802 --> 00:30:36,385
What happens if their abilities are more than their current challenge is that they become

517
00:30:36,445 --> 00:30:40,768
bored, and if their current abilities are not enough for the challenge that they are

518
00:30:40,788 --> 00:30:42,649
presented, they go into the zone of anxiety.

519
00:30:44,712 --> 00:30:48,813
It's important to keep players here, but bear in mind that, again, even though we want to

520
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:51,854
do that, we want to keep players within the realm of flow, we also want to give them a

521
00:30:51,914 --> 00:30:52,935
rollercoaster experience.

522
00:30:53,395 --> 00:30:56,716
So sometimes, in my personal opinion, it's important to break the flow a little bit.

523
00:30:57,156 --> 00:31:00,858
So you can see that, if you're coming back to this curve of intensity, you can see that

524
00:31:00,918 --> 00:31:07,801
it follows the flow curve roughly in this zone, but sometimes we want to deliberately

525
00:31:07,841 --> 00:31:08,701
break the flow here.

526
00:31:09,983 --> 00:31:13,426
so that we have levels that are a little bit more difficult, a little bit easier, like in this case.

527
00:31:13,526 --> 00:31:16,409
Like you can see that here, you want a level that is super easy so that it feels good,

528
00:31:16,669 --> 00:31:18,771
and then you ramp it up so that it becomes a difficult level again,

529
00:31:19,131 --> 00:31:21,133
so that they get some sort of emotional experience.

530
00:31:25,157 --> 00:31:29,721
But what makes an easy level, or what makes a hard level, is something that is super hard to define.

531
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:33,024
It varies from designer to designer, even within the same team.

532
00:31:33,465 --> 00:31:35,967
Like for me, what happened recently, in one example, was that...

533
00:31:36,909 --> 00:31:41,212
I created a level and I have this exercise of stating the average number of attempts

534
00:31:41,272 --> 00:31:43,594
I expect the player to fail in that level.

535
00:31:44,054 --> 00:31:47,597
I created a level, I'm like, yeah, okay, this level is hard, but it's moderately hard.

536
00:31:47,657 --> 00:31:50,559
Maybe it's like eight attempts, that was my guess.

537
00:31:51,199 --> 00:31:55,622
We sent it out for testing, we got the data back, and the actual number that came back

538
00:31:55,662 --> 00:32:00,085
was that the average number of attempts was 24, which shows that I probably designed levels

539
00:32:00,105 --> 00:32:00,786
a little bit too...

540
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:04,108
My idea of hard is probably a little bit too skewed.

541
00:32:04,857 --> 00:32:08,819
So it's super important that we have different modes of testing.

542
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:13,102
So the general testing cycle in King looks a little bit like this when you create levels.

543
00:32:13,602 --> 00:32:17,604
You start the level, and you create it, and first you self-test it, I would say an average

544
00:32:17,784 --> 00:32:21,146
of 15 to 20 times, where the designer plays it to make sure that everything is okay.

545
00:32:21,746 --> 00:32:26,489
And then there's some degree of internal testing, where you test with other designers in the

546
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:30,251
team, you test with other people in the team to play the levels to see if what everybody

547
00:32:30,291 --> 00:32:30,751
feels about it.

548
00:32:30,791 --> 00:32:31,291
Is it fun?

549
00:32:31,371 --> 00:32:31,912
Is it easy?

550
00:32:31,952 --> 00:32:32,372
Is it hard?

551
00:32:33,153 --> 00:32:36,675
And then once that's ready, you send it out for qualitative user tests.

552
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:39,737
We use different channels to see this, we send it out to actual users,

553
00:32:40,237 --> 00:32:41,698
and they play the levels, they play the game,

554
00:32:41,998 --> 00:32:46,320
and they give their feedback as they're talking through as they're playing the game.

555
00:32:47,941 --> 00:32:50,082
And if this is okay, if we get good enough feedback,

556
00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:52,283
then we send it out for playtest releases,

557
00:32:52,323 --> 00:32:57,206
which is often releasing the game in a country with a sample size of a few thousand people,

558
00:32:57,506 --> 00:32:59,967
so that we get some quantitative data that we can work with.

559
00:33:02,111 --> 00:33:06,794
In King, one of the sayings is that it's where the magician meets the mathematician.

560
00:33:07,714 --> 00:33:11,856
So as a level designer, you need to have a little bit of both.

561
00:33:11,896 --> 00:33:16,319
You need to have the magical gut of the magician to know what makes something fun, and you

562
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:19,080
need to be able to look at data and analyze it like a mathematician.

563
00:33:20,518 --> 00:33:24,280
If you're looking at free-to-play games, of course we're talking about the normal KPIs and measurements,

564
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:29,142
from retention to progression to difficulty, and finally monetization.

565
00:33:30,722 --> 00:33:35,284
This on its own could be... it's its own can of worms and it's a talk in itself.

566
00:33:35,804 --> 00:33:37,725
I don't have the time to go through all of them today,

567
00:33:38,185 --> 00:33:42,866
but the general concept is that we start from retention, because good retention is the starting point,

568
00:33:42,966 --> 00:33:46,688
and that will gradually and hopefully lead to good monetization later on.

569
00:33:47,937 --> 00:33:50,099
So if you look at retention, the things that come into mind

570
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:51,360
are these two concepts.

571
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,021
How difficult is the game?

572
00:33:53,061 --> 00:33:53,921
How difficult are the levels?

573
00:33:54,142 --> 00:33:55,262
And what's the player progression?

574
00:33:56,463 --> 00:33:58,204
Some of our charts look a little bit like this.

575
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:02,968
This is the example of a player progression chart.

576
00:34:03,528 --> 00:34:04,909
What starts here is 100%.

577
00:34:05,129 --> 00:34:06,690
So 100% of your players are at level 1.

578
00:34:07,071 --> 00:34:09,312
And you see the drop-offs across all the levels

579
00:34:09,452 --> 00:34:10,873
until level 100 or level 120.

580
00:34:12,414 --> 00:34:13,775
So you can see the percentage of players that drop.

581
00:34:14,748 --> 00:34:17,951
To pick up difficult levels is that when the drop is steep,

582
00:34:17,991 --> 00:34:19,192
like for example in this case, it's

583
00:34:19,212 --> 00:34:22,295
probably a series of easy levels and then a harder level here,

584
00:34:22,315 --> 00:34:24,096
or this case as well.

585
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:28,120
And when you plot that across different progressions

586
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,422
when you're doing A-B tests, it looks a little bit like this.

587
00:34:30,722 --> 00:34:33,504
Each of the colored bars here represent one curve,

588
00:34:34,185 --> 00:34:36,307
and this is the curve of the different progressions.

589
00:34:36,387 --> 00:34:38,188
The green one is the easiest one because it

590
00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:40,550
has the shallowest drop, and these

591
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:43,233
are steeper drops being harder progressions.

592
00:34:45,812 --> 00:34:48,754
To reinforce this, we also use this other curve to measure difficulty.

593
00:34:50,135 --> 00:34:52,376
This curve shows the cumulative number of attempts.

594
00:34:52,797 --> 00:34:57,920
So as the player progresses across the game, how many attempts do they take to go to level,

595
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,923
for example, if this is level 60, this is the different curves, and how many lives do

596
00:35:02,943 --> 00:35:04,304
the players spend to get here?

597
00:35:05,285 --> 00:35:06,525
Of course, this is normally an upward trend.

598
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,944
We reinforce this again by analyzing the level in this.

599
00:35:12,164 --> 00:35:14,467
With this graph, the average number

600
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:15,808
of attempts to pass a level.

601
00:35:16,349 --> 00:35:18,732
So each of these points are a different level,

602
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:20,974
and this shows you the average number of attempts.

603
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:22,936
So for example, if this is an easy level,

604
00:35:22,976 --> 00:35:24,218
maybe it's just two attempts.

605
00:35:24,578 --> 00:35:25,700
And this is probably a hard level,

606
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,443
which is average of nine or 10 attempts, probably.

607
00:35:32,205 --> 00:35:35,046
And when you look at data, it's one of those things that because we're running a live game,

608
00:35:35,106 --> 00:35:38,768
it just goes, it's something that we have to, coming back to the concept of balancing

609
00:35:38,808 --> 00:35:42,589
and testing, it just goes on and on and on and we're constantly tweaking it over and

610
00:35:42,689 --> 00:35:47,692
over and over again as we're running the game, so that we optimize it and do suit it for

611
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:48,572
the new players as well.

612
00:35:50,813 --> 00:35:52,314
How many of you have played the original Candy Crush?

613
00:35:54,475 --> 00:35:56,796
How many of you know or have passed level 65?

614
00:35:59,077 --> 00:36:01,378
How many of you think that level 65 is the worst level ever?

615
00:36:03,198 --> 00:36:03,538
That's right.

616
00:36:04,198 --> 00:36:05,358
So, it started that way.

617
00:36:05,638 --> 00:36:11,340
The history of Level 65 is that it started as, in the original Saga version of Candy

618
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,800
Crush, in the very, very first version, it was the hardest level.

619
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,001
And it was the last level.

620
00:36:16,381 --> 00:36:18,361
And that was before my time.

621
00:36:19,122 --> 00:36:23,483
And what happened was that, my guess is that the designers were thinking, okay, since it's

622
00:36:23,503 --> 00:36:25,603
the last level, let's throw everything into this level.

623
00:36:25,623 --> 00:36:28,344
Let's make it insanely hard so the players have a real challenge.

624
00:36:28,904 --> 00:36:31,405
When it became a proper Saga game with over 100 levels...

625
00:36:32,214 --> 00:36:36,338
It kind of remained that way, and players were stuck there for a super long time.

626
00:36:36,378 --> 00:36:39,821
If you look at some of the comments, this is taken from some of the websites,

627
00:36:40,842 --> 00:36:43,905
18% of people think that level 65 was the most difficult level ever.

628
00:36:46,107 --> 00:36:48,550
I love this comment a lot, about some feedback about it.

629
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:50,992
This level just sucks. There isn't any way to describe it.

630
00:36:51,112 --> 00:36:52,914
Really, it's not you, this level just sucks.

631
00:36:54,392 --> 00:36:59,575
So, what happened later was that, because of the feedback and because we created more

632
00:36:59,616 --> 00:37:03,538
levels for the players to progress, the level was tweaked over and over and over again.

633
00:37:03,878 --> 00:37:08,221
With the data that we got, with the matrix that we have, we tweaked it using different

634
00:37:08,241 --> 00:37:13,044
things like removing the chocolate in the corner, reducing the level of the frosting,

635
00:37:13,084 --> 00:37:13,604
for example.

636
00:37:14,005 --> 00:37:15,125
Some of the different things that we did.

637
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:17,747
And then we finally got to this result, which is...

638
00:37:18,588 --> 00:37:22,111
Yeah, one of these players was saying that this used to be one of the most difficult levels

639
00:37:22,391 --> 00:37:24,512
until it was modified and now it is one of the fun levels.

640
00:37:24,613 --> 00:37:28,396
So this is an example, an infamous example of how we managed to use data

641
00:37:28,416 --> 00:37:32,779
to tweak a level that was notoriously difficult to become a fun level.

642
00:37:36,316 --> 00:37:38,539
And with that, I think we've covered the four T's.

643
00:37:38,739 --> 00:37:41,041
So just to recap what we're talking about today,

644
00:37:41,762 --> 00:37:44,145
the section of theory, where we give an overview of level

645
00:37:44,165 --> 00:37:46,648
design, thought, where we talk about the four level design

646
00:37:46,668 --> 00:37:48,610
principles, the tools, I show you

647
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,352
how we use the tools to build a saga,

648
00:37:50,993 --> 00:37:53,816
and testing, how we test to tweak the levels.

649
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,792
Again, a recap of the level design process.

650
00:37:57,932 --> 00:37:58,773
It looks a little bit like this.

651
00:37:58,793 --> 00:37:59,934
It starts from a level concept.

652
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:02,416
You create a level layout, and then you create a level

653
00:38:02,456 --> 00:38:03,217
in the level editor.

654
00:38:03,637 --> 00:38:06,319
You balance the level, you test it, and it goes on forever.

655
00:38:08,241 --> 00:38:10,223
And finally, the four concepts again.

656
00:38:10,523 --> 00:38:13,325
Difficulty, how to make fun levels.

657
00:38:13,345 --> 00:38:15,467
So difficulty, how to keep players challenged in the levels.

658
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:17,409
Rhythm, how to vary the experience

659
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:18,670
so that it's an emotional journey.

660
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,292
Flow, how to keep players moving towards the goal.

661
00:38:21,793 --> 00:38:24,095
And hooks, how to make one level different from another.

662
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:26,389
And we are done.

663
00:38:40,041 --> 00:38:40,662
Yep, questions?

664
00:38:40,682 --> 00:38:43,725
Is there a mic?

665
00:38:44,966 --> 00:38:46,988
Yeah please stay, let me just give you a mic.

666
00:38:47,008 --> 00:38:50,671
So it would be great if you could introduce yourself and where you're from

667
00:38:51,051 --> 00:38:51,912
before you ask the question.

668
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:58,091
Hey, my name is Varun.

669
00:38:58,171 --> 00:38:59,712
I'm from Bigpoint in Hamburg.

670
00:39:00,013 --> 00:39:00,173
Yep.

671
00:39:00,493 --> 00:39:01,534
That's a really good talk, by the way.

672
00:39:01,554 --> 00:39:02,555
Thank you so much for sharing.

673
00:39:02,775 --> 00:39:03,175
Thank you.

674
00:39:03,495 --> 00:39:05,397
So is each and every, so basically

675
00:39:05,417 --> 00:39:08,639
from your presentation, each and every level on the Saga games

676
00:39:08,739 --> 00:39:10,060
are like handcrafted, right?

677
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:11,602
Which is really, really cool.

678
00:39:11,962 --> 00:39:13,623
But is there some sort of an algorithm

679
00:39:13,723 --> 00:39:15,365
or some sort of machine learning that

680
00:39:15,425 --> 00:39:17,206
goes into place in terms of, hey,

681
00:39:17,426 --> 00:39:21,930
player X has failed at level 71 X number of times.

682
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:25,493
So it's going to automatically tune the number of turns he has.

683
00:39:25,953 --> 00:39:27,755
to give him a few additional turns, maybe?

684
00:39:28,056 --> 00:39:28,236
Yep.

685
00:39:28,716 --> 00:39:31,079
So it's a good question.

686
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:32,401
It's an interesting question.

687
00:39:32,761 --> 00:39:34,323
So I think if I got it right, the question

688
00:39:34,363 --> 00:39:36,466
is that is there any kind of machine learning

689
00:39:36,606 --> 00:39:39,710
for to know if the levels are easy or difficult, right?

690
00:39:40,451 --> 00:39:43,415
So to be a little bit of a self-company pimping.

691
00:39:45,136 --> 00:39:49,040
There's a talk later today, I think, where he's talking about how AI is used in Candy Crush,

692
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:54,985
and that's exactly what we do. We actually have bots in the different teams where they play the levels to,

693
00:39:55,085 --> 00:39:59,029
where the bot plays the levels to see the average number of attempts of passing or failing,

694
00:39:59,429 --> 00:40:03,613
and we use AI for this. Having said that, what I know, and I'm not an expert in this,

695
00:40:03,633 --> 00:40:05,434
but what I hear from the other teams is that

696
00:40:06,511 --> 00:40:09,133
The bots are normally super inaccurate.

697
00:40:09,553 --> 00:40:13,496
They are good for predicting some degree of difficulty

698
00:40:13,776 --> 00:40:16,678
on a curve, but there's always some degree of offset as well

699
00:40:16,878 --> 00:40:18,959
because a lot of it still comes,

700
00:40:18,979 --> 00:40:21,341
the bulk of it still comes from actual data

701
00:40:21,381 --> 00:40:22,762
when we send the levels out live,

702
00:40:23,582 --> 00:40:24,343
and we tweak it from there.

703
00:40:34,993 --> 00:40:38,416
Hi, my name is Sophie and I come from Buga, Belgium as well.

704
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,056
Thanks for the talk.

705
00:40:39,157 --> 00:40:43,280
I had a question about more when you have the levels live.

706
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,362
So you said the importance about testing, balancing, and so on,

707
00:40:46,462 --> 00:40:47,643
even after they were shipped.

708
00:40:48,704 --> 00:40:51,246
I remember I saw in some levels of Candy Crush

709
00:40:51,306 --> 00:40:53,048
where people can rate the levels.

710
00:40:53,088 --> 00:40:56,130
So how do you use that data as well in the process

711
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,891
of rebalancing the levels?

712
00:40:58,607 --> 00:41:00,330
Sorry, where people can rate the levels?

713
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:03,073
Yeah, so you finish the level and you are asked as a player,

714
00:41:03,154 --> 00:41:05,857
so how did you enjoy the level, and you put a star rating.

715
00:41:06,819 --> 00:41:08,561
And I don't know if that's part of your process.

716
00:41:09,282 --> 00:41:09,542
All right.

717
00:41:10,003 --> 00:41:11,986
So this is an interesting question,

718
00:41:12,046 --> 00:41:14,649
and I cannot really directly answer it because I'm not.

719
00:41:15,352 --> 00:41:16,434
I didn't work on Candy Crush Soda.

720
00:41:17,956 --> 00:41:22,421
But I think it's probably as king because we're running live games and we're testing

721
00:41:22,441 --> 00:41:23,082
things all the time.

722
00:41:23,563 --> 00:41:26,647
Most probably that was probably when you saw it, it was probably either an A-B test or

723
00:41:26,667 --> 00:41:28,329
something that was just running for a period of time.

724
00:41:28,629 --> 00:41:32,814
But from my best knowledge, I think that the main data that we still use are some of the

725
00:41:32,835 --> 00:41:33,255
stuff that we...

726
00:41:33,635 --> 00:41:37,777
that I mentioned in the talk. Things like the normal drop-offs or things like the average number of attempts.

727
00:41:38,238 --> 00:41:43,700
So maybe it's factoring, like how fun it is, but fun is always like a super subjective thing and it's really hard, a lot

728
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:49,343
harder to use that kind of data to tweak your levels compared to more like more hardcore numerical data.

729
00:41:56,687 --> 00:41:58,248
Yep, was there another question? Yep, here.

730
00:42:04,311 --> 00:42:08,232
Just a straightforward question, how do you self-launch levels?

731
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:14,655
Like, do you, for end players, do you just like release them first in some other countries?

732
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:16,656
Or is there a smarter way to do that?

733
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:19,958
So I think different teams do it differently,

734
00:42:19,978 --> 00:42:23,580
but one of the more effective ways is really A-B testing.

735
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:27,702
So when we're launching a new episode, we often just A-B test it if we have to,

736
00:42:27,822 --> 00:42:30,665
or A-B testing it in a smaller country, in a smaller group,

737
00:42:31,165 --> 00:42:32,646
and then see what the data is.

738
00:42:33,067 --> 00:42:36,249
So again, coming back to it, but of course, these kind of processes are more

739
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:37,991
qualitative than quantitative.

740
00:42:38,191 --> 00:42:41,894
So even though we try to do that, but a lot of it still,

741
00:42:42,655 --> 00:42:45,297
I would say, turns out quite differently when we actually release the levels live

742
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:46,178
to a larger volume.

743
00:42:46,618 --> 00:42:49,280
So it's a super tricky process, which is why there's this process of going on

744
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,622
about tweaking it almost like forever.

745
00:42:52,708 --> 00:42:56,052
So for every chapter you release, you A, B test it,

746
00:42:56,292 --> 00:42:57,673
and then you keep the best levels?

747
00:42:59,415 --> 00:43:01,037
Not every chapter, but sometimes it

748
00:43:01,137 --> 00:43:02,318
especially depends on what the purpose is.

749
00:43:02,358 --> 00:43:03,619
If there's a new blocker, sometimes

750
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:04,861
it's important to do that.

751
00:43:05,842 --> 00:43:07,864
But most of the time, if it's just one progression,

752
00:43:07,904 --> 00:43:09,986
we also try to do some sort of preliminary testing,

753
00:43:10,006 --> 00:43:11,387
like sending out to a smaller sample group.

754
00:43:11,747 --> 00:43:12,628
Even if it's one progression, just

755
00:43:12,648 --> 00:43:14,751
to see some initial feedback.

756
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:15,351
OK.

757
00:43:15,511 --> 00:43:15,712
Thank you.

758
00:43:28,678 --> 00:43:35,301
Hello, I'm Mark from Bohemia Interactive. My question is how you control the random

759
00:43:35,461 --> 00:43:41,685
aspect of the levels? Like, especially considering the casual audience?

760
00:43:42,865 --> 00:43:51,329
If, like, there are no dangers of some dead stops or something like that?

761
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:56,712
All right. So this one is super tricky and depends from game to game, right?

762
00:43:56,812 --> 00:43:57,833
If you talk about a game...

763
00:43:58,565 --> 00:44:03,607
depending on the core of the game. If you talk about a game like Blossom Blast, which is very focused around chain reactions,

764
00:44:04,087 --> 00:44:10,068
the degree of randomness from the core itself is a lot higher, that something can happen from one turn to the other turn, right?

765
00:44:10,628 --> 00:44:14,790
In Candy Crush, similarly as well, because after you make a match, even if it's a small match,

766
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:20,571
the chances of things cascading into something more, or like creating a power-up through cascades, that's pretty high.

767
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:27,654
So most of our games are built where there's some degree of luck in the core mechanics,

768
00:44:28,155 --> 00:44:31,598
and to do it, like coming back to one of the previous examples that I was showing,

769
00:44:32,379 --> 00:44:36,162
the slide where it has this power-ups that have the chance of some objects being power-ups,

770
00:44:36,543 --> 00:44:41,047
there we try to do this semi-deterministic approach to some extent, where some of these

771
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:45,130
things have the chance of spawning. That is in our game because we don't create power-ups on the fly.

772
00:44:45,591 --> 00:44:48,754
So there are different factors to try to do it, and it really depends from game to game.

773
00:44:50,054 --> 00:44:57,039
And isn't there a danger that the level performs different as a level designer intended?

774
00:44:57,739 --> 00:45:01,862
Yes, there is. So, again, different games have different methods of doing it.

775
00:45:01,982 --> 00:45:06,565
Like, I think in Candy Crush they use a seeding system to determine certain seeds,

776
00:45:06,705 --> 00:45:10,107
and they actually use that to filter out what's a good seed versus a bad seed.

777
00:45:11,768 --> 00:45:13,469
But yeah, there's so many different ways to do it.

778
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:17,012
Like, it's one of those things that, because of the sheer chance of it, and...

779
00:45:18,361 --> 00:45:22,364
Yeah, because of the sheer chance of it, it's just so hard to always be able to predict what's going to happen.

780
00:45:23,786 --> 00:45:25,267
So, it's not something that it's...

781
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:28,489
Some degree of... We have some degree of control to it,

782
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:33,353
but very often it's also at a point where you start the board and you look at it and you're like,

783
00:45:33,434 --> 00:45:37,877
oh, crap, there's no way I'm going to win this level in... You know that in five turns.

784
00:45:38,117 --> 00:45:39,719
So that's when you have a bad seed, for example.

785
00:45:39,899 --> 00:45:41,700
And promise the last one.

786
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:47,485
Is there something which you design into the level as a point of no return for the player?

787
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:54,063
has a sorry a point of no return I mean like a sequence of moves you have to do to actually

788
00:45:54,104 --> 00:45:57,691
finish the level or you just can't yeah so

789
00:45:58,895 --> 00:46:02,118
We try to avoid that, but if you see that, if you play enough, like, especially like

790
00:46:02,138 --> 00:46:05,060
some of the Candy Crush games, like Soda, like there are some levels where they have

791
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:05,781
blockers on top.

792
00:46:06,842 --> 00:46:10,646
If you do enough wrong moves at the start of the level, you can come to a situation

793
00:46:10,706 --> 00:46:14,649
where there's no move and normally that becomes like a heart fail scenario.

794
00:46:14,729 --> 00:46:17,792
We try to avoid that as much as we can, but it still happens.

795
00:46:18,533 --> 00:46:20,134
So there are scenarios like this.

796
00:46:20,454 --> 00:46:22,295
And the opposite of that is the positive side.

797
00:46:22,355 --> 00:46:24,136
What happens when you create so many power-ups

798
00:46:24,176 --> 00:46:25,117
that it cascades forever?

799
00:46:25,697 --> 00:46:27,839
If you notice this, and this is pretty subtle in Candy Crush

800
00:46:27,859 --> 00:46:32,622
Soda again, if after a certain number of rounds of cascade,

801
00:46:33,262 --> 00:46:35,664
but what happens if you cascade too much is that they throw

802
00:46:35,764 --> 00:46:38,505
a six candy, the indigo candy, into the mix

803
00:46:38,525 --> 00:46:39,746
so that the cascades just stop.

804
00:46:40,166 --> 00:46:42,288
So yeah, there are fail-safes on both sides

805
00:46:42,348 --> 00:46:45,229
to prevent things from, yeah, whether it's too good

806
00:46:45,249 --> 00:46:45,910
or whether it's too bad.

807
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:47,071
Thank you.

808
00:46:47,491 --> 00:46:47,591
Yeah.

809
00:46:53,672 --> 00:46:54,492
Any other questions?

810
00:47:03,316 --> 00:47:05,197
I have a question.

811
00:47:05,458 --> 00:47:06,658
Why linear progression?

812
00:47:07,479 --> 00:47:07,679
What?

813
00:47:08,199 --> 00:47:12,881
In all your games, there is a linear progression.

814
00:47:14,202 --> 00:47:17,263
Why not some tree or?

815
00:47:18,608 --> 00:47:23,010
So, as a company, we are trying to experiment with this, especially, right?

816
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:27,852
And when we started, linear progression is one of those things that is new.

817
00:47:28,052 --> 00:47:30,253
It was new and it was easy for casual players to understand.

818
00:47:30,633 --> 00:47:32,314
And it's age-old, right?

819
00:47:32,334 --> 00:47:35,356
If you look at traditional, even from the old Mario, it's about linear progression

820
00:47:35,396 --> 00:47:37,897
and it's about moving, seeing new levels to the other, right?

821
00:47:38,157 --> 00:47:42,359
So this is a super strong driver for casual players to always see new levels to play,

822
00:47:42,419 --> 00:47:42,979
to move forward.

823
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:48,005
Having said that, Candy Crush is like, I don't know, four or five years old by now,

824
00:47:48,645 --> 00:47:52,269
and we are experimenting with different things to make, like, non-linear progressions as well.

825
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:57,894
But, I think there's a lot of unannounced projects, and we are experimenting a lot of these internally,

826
00:47:58,315 --> 00:48:01,278
but we haven't found, or we're still trying to find the best way to present this.

827
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:06,162
The biggest problem here is that, how do you get players from...

828
00:48:07,182 --> 00:48:11,243
being so used to linear progression of just moving forward to see the next level,

829
00:48:11,823 --> 00:48:16,145
how do you get them into, for example, what happens if we do branching paths or alternate paths,

830
00:48:16,465 --> 00:48:18,966
or where they can choose, what if it becomes open world?

831
00:48:19,706 --> 00:48:24,448
I think it's more like a UX problem of trying to figure out how to push players into this.

832
00:48:24,808 --> 00:48:29,030
There is definitely a strong motivation and a strong driver for non-linear approaches,

833
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:32,211
but we're still experimenting with the best ways to actually do it for our audience.

834
00:48:44,383 --> 00:48:50,847
How do you keep inspiration flowing in when you've produced hundreds of levels with the same elements?

835
00:48:51,348 --> 00:48:52,348
From the designer point?

836
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:53,169
Yeah.

837
00:48:53,789 --> 00:48:54,070
Hmm.

838
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:59,734
The heart...

839
00:49:00,034 --> 00:49:06,338
The heart ultimate, ultimate, ultimate, ultimate, ultimate solution is transferring to another team so that you start something new.

840
00:49:08,502 --> 00:49:10,986
But yeah, it's difficult because it depends.

841
00:49:11,086 --> 00:49:12,549
Different designers want different things.

842
00:49:12,869 --> 00:49:14,992
Some people are really okay with just building new content

843
00:49:15,033 --> 00:49:16,575
and they want to specialize in that.

844
00:49:17,076 --> 00:49:18,618
I mean, and some people are just like,

845
00:49:18,638 --> 00:49:21,623
they kind of just want to do new stuff all the time.

846
00:49:21,783 --> 00:49:21,963
So...

847
00:49:23,616 --> 00:49:29,601
The good thing about King is that the company is big enough so that we have a lot of movement of internal manpower swaps,

848
00:49:29,641 --> 00:49:33,404
whether it's the comments, or whether it's transfers, or even within the studio moving to another project,

849
00:49:34,825 --> 00:49:36,546
so that everybody is equally motivated.

850
00:49:36,646 --> 00:49:41,250
Having said that, there is still definitely some degree of...

851
00:49:44,073 --> 00:49:46,475
monotony, maybe, to this whole thing,

852
00:49:47,375 --> 00:49:49,918
but I would love to say that...

853
00:49:51,159 --> 00:49:52,219
Yeah, I would love to say that...

854
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:56,614
Knowing that our players are enjoying our games makes me happy, but I'll be lying.

855
00:49:56,855 --> 00:49:59,237
So, it's... it's there.

856
00:49:59,678 --> 00:50:01,480
It's something. It's there, you have to do it.

857
00:50:02,321 --> 00:50:03,703
And you try to find the fun in it.

858
00:50:03,983 --> 00:50:05,945
Like, game design is not always fun.

859
00:50:05,965 --> 00:50:07,667
There are the good parts and there are the bad parts, right?

860
00:50:07,807 --> 00:50:08,989
So, you find something that clicks.

861
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,311
Any other questions?

862
00:50:30,073 --> 00:50:30,214
Yup.

863
00:50:32,215 --> 00:50:38,381
Do level designers, like for Candy Crush and stuff, do they have to keep monetization in mind as well? Or is that a completely different...

864
00:50:39,141 --> 00:50:39,362
It's...

865
00:50:41,844 --> 00:50:48,830
This is where it becomes a little bit tricky to speak about because I'm not sure at which point would my legal come and stop me and like...

866
00:50:50,504 --> 00:50:53,613
So, it focuses on retention first for sure, right?

867
00:50:55,258 --> 00:50:58,287
Monetization becomes its own problem later.

868
00:50:59,026 --> 00:51:03,009
But quite often we have cases where we start a game thinking about building fun levels,

869
00:51:03,049 --> 00:51:04,451
and that's always where it starts, right?

870
00:51:05,031 --> 00:51:08,854
And you build fun levels, it's fun, players love it,

871
00:51:09,175 --> 00:51:11,857
but sometimes maybe it's too easy, maybe it's too boring,

872
00:51:11,897 --> 00:51:14,639
maybe it's the same thing over and over again, and it doesn't monetize, right?

873
00:51:14,759 --> 00:51:18,462
So normally the process is that we look at different matrices

874
00:51:18,582 --> 00:51:20,964
at different points of where we are in playtest.

875
00:51:21,085 --> 00:51:23,126
So we always start from looking at short-term retention,

876
00:51:23,166 --> 00:51:26,209
long-term retention, or mid-term retention, and then we look at monetization.

877
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:32,016
And there are some things which I probably cannot really super share about what are some of the things that we do,

878
00:51:32,036 --> 00:51:36,903
or what are some of the things that King knows, or King tries to maximize monetization.

879
00:51:37,924 --> 00:51:40,728
But there's definitely different stages and there are different things that we apply.

880
00:51:40,748 --> 00:51:41,889
Thank you.

881
00:51:49,526 --> 00:51:52,128
How many level designers do we have per team, normally?

882
00:51:52,588 --> 00:51:53,309
If I can ask that.

883
00:51:53,829 --> 00:51:54,089
Hmm.

884
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:58,473
This is different from, depends on how big the game is and depends on where it is.

885
00:51:58,533 --> 00:52:00,354
I think if I'm not wrong, Candy Crush

886
00:52:01,655 --> 00:52:06,640
at one point had four level designers per team, and this is just level designers, I think,

887
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:11,625
not even considering the game designers. Like on our team currently, because our game is still

888
00:52:12,145 --> 00:52:17,310
going, potentially going to soft launch, we have three designers, but two of them,

889
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:19,812
but we all do level design. Thank you.

890
00:52:26,787 --> 00:52:30,091
When it comes to rhythm, what do you think, like,

891
00:52:30,672 --> 00:52:32,113
how many things can you introduce

892
00:52:32,174 --> 00:52:33,695
in the early pack of the game?

893
00:52:35,538 --> 00:52:37,340
Because you have so many different level types

894
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,702
that has spawned across the game,

895
00:52:38,742 --> 00:52:40,805
but what should be the, is there a standard

896
00:52:40,845 --> 00:52:42,327
that you did use in the first pack of the game?

897
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:44,255
Well, it depends on whether the game...

898
00:52:44,275 --> 00:52:45,496
Again, it depends on whether it's a new game

899
00:52:45,516 --> 00:52:47,737
with a new mechanic or whether it's one of the sequels, right?

900
00:52:48,658 --> 00:52:50,899
If you look at some of the current examples that we have,

901
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:53,541
Farm Heroes, Super Saga, or like Candy Crush Soda,

902
00:52:54,102 --> 00:52:54,622
what these...

903
00:52:54,682 --> 00:52:56,703
The sequels, the approach is normally to introduce

904
00:52:56,723 --> 00:52:58,685
your new features as early as possible

905
00:52:58,985 --> 00:53:00,746
because it's the five-minute experience.

906
00:53:00,766 --> 00:53:02,127
You want players, returning players,

907
00:53:02,147 --> 00:53:03,268
to come in and see something new

908
00:53:03,588 --> 00:53:04,609
so that they get hooked, right?

909
00:53:05,409 --> 00:53:07,211
If it's a new game like Blossom Blast, for example,

910
00:53:07,791 --> 00:53:08,772
I think, if I'm not wrong,

911
00:53:09,192 --> 00:53:10,613
remembering the beat chart is...

912
00:53:11,725 --> 00:53:15,768
Throughout the whole game, there's only three game modes for the first 100 levels.

913
00:53:15,848 --> 00:53:20,351
I think it's score, the bloom, the big buds, and remove the weeds for the first 100 levels.

914
00:53:20,412 --> 00:53:22,793
But every 20 levels, they have a blocker or something.

915
00:53:23,294 --> 00:53:25,976
So, again, it depends on the game and depends on the content.

916
00:53:26,376 --> 00:53:29,759
But when it comes to rhythm, I think some of the things that we try to do is to not

917
00:53:30,139 --> 00:53:35,884
use the same game mode for more than five levels in a row, or three levels in a row,

918
00:53:35,904 --> 00:53:38,325
so that it's not the same game mode over and over again.

919
00:53:38,546 --> 00:53:41,128
And again, alternating between hard and easy levels, so that it's not

920
00:53:41,688 --> 00:53:43,829
two hard levels or three hard levels in a row

921
00:53:43,969 --> 00:53:45,330
that frustrate the players and make them churn.

922
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:47,331
So we try to monitor these things

923
00:53:47,351 --> 00:53:48,392
a little bit more closely.

924
00:53:48,412 --> 00:53:57,617
All right, we have time for one more question

925
00:53:57,657 --> 00:53:59,038
if there's any final questions.

926
00:54:06,998 --> 00:54:12,725
While having like hundreds of levels, is there someone who guides the overall progression,

927
00:54:13,025 --> 00:54:17,911
like the overall curve of the whole sum of the levels?

928
00:54:18,457 --> 00:54:24,761
Or is it like you have individual level designers and everybody is doing his own thing?

929
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:34,547
Or is there someone who says like, listen, we would need like, I don't know, ten harder levels with this kind of like concepts in them?

930
00:54:35,408 --> 00:54:36,909
Or is it just individual?

931
00:54:37,217 --> 00:54:41,241
So I think it depends, the question depends on individual teams again.

932
00:54:43,764 --> 00:54:48,069
In my current project, we have three designers and because we are still at the early stages,

933
00:54:49,851 --> 00:54:52,934
I try to oversee the whole progression to know each level.

934
00:54:54,876 --> 00:55:00,019
My designers are always saying that I'm just a freak because I can memorise all the levels

935
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:03,401
because I just know which level is where, like mysteriously.

936
00:55:05,062 --> 00:55:06,623
But I think at some point it cracks.

937
00:55:06,963 --> 00:55:08,344
I don't think I can keep this on.

938
00:55:08,364 --> 00:55:12,446
Maybe this works for the first 50 or the first 100 levels maybe, but when you go to a thousand

939
00:55:12,466 --> 00:55:14,948
levels it's hard to memorise all of them, right?

940
00:55:14,988 --> 00:55:17,189
So I think different designers work on different things.

941
00:55:17,849 --> 00:55:21,732
As you get later and later in the game, the most important is the first few levels, the

942
00:55:21,752 --> 00:55:25,194
first 50 levels for example, because this is where a lot of players decide whether they

943
00:55:25,214 --> 00:55:27,816
want to play the game or they want to drop out of the game, right?

944
00:55:28,236 --> 00:55:32,059
So I think, for me I'm very particular about these, personally I'm super particular about

945
00:55:32,299 --> 00:55:36,281
the progression in these levels, and I think in the later levels, once you get past a certain

946
00:55:36,321 --> 00:55:39,223
point, the players are used to the difficulty, and then it becomes more...

947
00:55:40,578 --> 00:55:42,519
it becomes more self-contained.

948
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:44,660
Every episode has its own highs and lows.

949
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,200
They're getting more difficult gradually,

950
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:47,621
towards the episode,

951
00:55:48,021 --> 00:55:49,462
but sometimes it's just, for example,

952
00:55:49,502 --> 00:55:51,243
the number of difficult levels in the episode

953
00:55:51,303 --> 00:55:52,463
versus the previous episode.

954
00:55:52,964 --> 00:55:55,125
And not so much about absolute levels being

955
00:55:55,625 --> 00:55:57,386
absolutely harder than they were previously.

956
00:55:58,190 --> 00:56:00,613
So you have something like a, let's call it,

957
00:56:00,713 --> 00:56:04,277
difficulty budget for every episode.

958
00:56:05,479 --> 00:56:07,141
How you can assure that,

959
00:56:07,501 --> 00:56:10,064
how you can assure the curve you have shown?

960
00:56:10,725 --> 00:56:12,988
Because like, if everyone is doing,

961
00:56:13,388 --> 00:56:16,512
I'm doing my level and it's more difficult.

962
00:56:18,112 --> 00:56:19,533
So normally, I think one of the processes

963
00:56:19,573 --> 00:56:21,814
is that the team actually sits down and when you play it,

964
00:56:22,475 --> 00:56:23,655
you try to play a progression through.

965
00:56:23,675 --> 00:56:25,716
You know roughly which are the easy levels

966
00:56:25,756 --> 00:56:26,677
or which are the hard levels.

967
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:28,358
And you bring this up for an internal review.

968
00:56:28,758 --> 00:56:31,299
But at that point, before it's sent out for any kind of data,

969
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:34,741
it's really basically just a designer's magical magician's

970
00:56:34,881 --> 00:56:37,183
gut guess of like, OK, I think this is fun.

971
00:56:37,223 --> 00:56:38,864
I think this is easy enough or this is hard enough.

972
00:56:39,364 --> 00:56:41,265
And very often, we need to use the data that

973
00:56:41,285 --> 00:56:43,066
comes in later to tweak them, which

974
00:56:43,126 --> 00:56:45,067
is why the tweaking goes on for a super long time.

975
00:56:46,428 --> 00:56:46,748
Thank you.

976
00:56:47,348 --> 00:56:47,668
All right.

977
00:56:48,582 --> 00:56:53,084
I think we're out of time, but one favor that I have is that can I take a selfie with everybody

978
00:56:53,124 --> 00:56:54,085
so that I can show my mom?

979
00:57:07,611 --> 00:57:09,092
Alright! Thank you!
