1
00:00:08,557 --> 00:00:15,943
Well, I think we should get started. So hello, everyone. First I would like to ask you to

2
00:00:15,943 --> 00:00:24,931
silence your phones because we have some music to play here. And also if you have questions

3
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:32,198
at the end, then I ask you to walk up to the microphone in the middle and make a line if

4
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,380
there are many that have questions.

5
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:48,658
So thank you for being here. And thank you to GTC for accepting us here with this talk

6
00:00:48,658 --> 00:00:57,665
about intelligent music. My name is Paltur Paltursson and I work as an audio director

7
00:00:57,665 --> 00:01:05,050
at GCP games, mainly working on EVE Online. In case you don't know what EVE Online is,

8
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,892
it's a sandbox MMO.

9
00:01:08,896 --> 00:01:20,344
with some 20,000 to 60,000 players playing at one time on one server. And with me here

10
00:01:20,344 --> 00:01:30,311
is Dr. Kerstin Oleson, composer and professor who has been working on procedural music for

11
00:01:30,311 --> 00:01:36,796
many years, more than 20 years. And we're going to be talking about something we like

12
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:37,896
to call intelligent music.

13
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:50,737
Now let's find out what we mean by this. So first I want to do a short introduction on

14
00:01:50,737 --> 00:02:00,103
EVE Online and why we seek better ways of making music in this game. Then my colleague

15
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:04,505
Dr. Kertan will introduce his system. He calls it Calmus.

16
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:09,875
And finally we'll do some demonstrations of the system

17
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:16,458
works together with the game. Also before I start, before we

18
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:20,780
start, I think it's important to stress the fact that this is

19
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:27,623
very much a work in progress, so please bear that in mind.

20
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:36,474
We start with the EVE online. So the music has been part of the game from the beginning,

21
00:02:36,474 --> 00:02:43,159
obviously, like for most games there is music. And from 2003 to 2009, we had a thing in the

22
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:51,065
game called the jukebox, which was really just a playlist that played a number of old

23
00:02:51,065 --> 00:02:53,727
tracks specifically made for the game.

24
00:02:55,102 --> 00:03:01,264
is actually we still use this music and we have added some and we still play old tracks

25
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:07,346
for part of the game. This is really, really simple. It worked well, especially since the

26
00:03:07,346 --> 00:03:12,868
game was very, very atmospheric and it worked really well just to have some music playing

27
00:03:12,868 --> 00:03:16,469
that was very atmospheric and didn't change very much.

28
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:17,069
So before 2009 we had

29
00:03:23,372 --> 00:03:29,013
bunch of solutions handling the audio in the game. Most of it

30
00:03:29,013 --> 00:03:35,295
was home grown. So proprietary solutions handling audio. This

31
00:03:35,295 --> 00:03:39,995
was obviously very expensive and time consuming and in 2009 we

32
00:03:39,995 --> 00:03:45,237
implemented twice which changed a lot. And for music we were

33
00:03:45,237 --> 00:03:50,058
able to add precomposed elements of music. We can stack up in

34
00:03:50,058 --> 00:03:51,118
every way we want it.

35
00:03:51,805 --> 00:03:58,788
and playing any number of ways you want it and so on. So it was great to have Wwise as

36
00:03:58,788 --> 00:04:12,074
part of the whole system. So in the game, there are many different systems,

37
00:04:12,074 --> 00:04:20,238
lack of a better word. So we have empire space, which is basically

38
00:04:21,847 --> 00:04:27,311
pretty safe for players. Players start out there and they can go out and they can mine

39
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:32,435
and do whatever they do when they start the game. It's pretty safe. The police is there.

40
00:04:32,435 --> 00:04:38,040
You're not attacked. The music can be really easy. And you can play old tracks like we

41
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,921
have done. And the system, the new Eden, as we call,

42
00:04:48,392 --> 00:04:53,695
the space in Eve, it's called New Eden.

43
00:04:53,695 --> 00:04:55,496
It has more than 7,000 solar systems

44
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:58,958
with I don't know how many moons and planets,

45
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,480
just countless almost.

46
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:08,184
And most often very safe to start in Empire Space,

47
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:11,506
but if you go down to low sec and down to zero sec

48
00:05:11,506 --> 00:05:14,448
in wormhole space, it changes a lot.

49
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:14,728
So.

50
00:05:21,634 --> 00:05:27,637
Usually it's not recommended for players to wander around and go to these places like

51
00:05:27,637 --> 00:05:33,701
Losac and Zero in the beginning at least. So they stay in Empire Space a lot.

52
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:38,683
So the music in the game is based on these systems.

53
00:05:41,628 --> 00:05:47,632
So in Empire we have it easy going. In Low Sack we have it similar to Empire Space, but

54
00:05:47,632 --> 00:05:54,657
it has some more difficult intervals in the music maybe. And, you know, the timbre is

55
00:05:54,657 --> 00:06:06,306
different in the instruments and so on. In Zero Sack we have vertical really almost sound

56
00:06:06,306 --> 00:06:07,186
mass music.

57
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:16,055
which plays in any way we want. We can stack up whatever we want there and it just plays

58
00:06:16,055 --> 00:06:24,160
sound mass kind of thing with classical instruments. And in wormhole space it's similar, it's even

59
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:34,106
more sinister. So it gets worse as it gets lower. So this is fine. I mean, this works

60
00:06:34,106 --> 00:06:34,726
up to a point.

61
00:06:36,368 --> 00:06:46,593
It sets the stage in most cases unless some players decide to change things because it's

62
00:06:46,593 --> 00:06:52,116
a sandbox. We don't know what's going to happen. We haven't set the story. So the players are

63
00:06:52,116 --> 00:06:54,597
really the ones that change the things there.

64
00:06:55,025 --> 00:06:59,587
So we don't know what they're going to do. We have no idea. So, for example, in empire

65
00:06:59,587 --> 00:07:07,392
space, you think it's safe. Sometimes we have kamikaze pilots fly into you and you're dead.

66
00:07:07,392 --> 00:07:15,857
Or some corporation declares war on you and you're just trying to mind and mind your own

67
00:07:15,857 --> 00:07:21,020
business. So that should change the music as well. But we still have the same kind of

68
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,321
music there. It's easygoing and so on.

69
00:07:25,535 --> 00:07:34,002
And likewise in LOSAC or CERO, if there's a big corporation there that has a station

70
00:07:34,002 --> 00:07:39,908
there and a lot of players, it's not very difficult for them to stay there. So maybe

71
00:07:39,908 --> 00:07:44,532
the music is too much in that case for them to be like it is.

72
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:50,357
So let's hear what these sound like just so you get an idea.

73
00:07:58,024 --> 00:08:04,930
This is Empire Space, where everything is fine and dandy.

74
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:16,760
You can go around and mine, fly around, talk to your friends, have fun, and so on.

75
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:21,624
All the music there is like easy going.

76
00:08:21,624 --> 00:08:23,346
And very nice.

77
00:08:23,346 --> 00:08:26,308
You can listen to it for hours.

78
00:08:27,288 --> 00:08:29,869
It's nice.

79
00:08:29,869 --> 00:08:33,452
Then Losec.

80
00:08:33,452 --> 00:08:35,973
Similar but a little more sinister, maybe.

81
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:39,916
It gives an idea of, well, maybe I shouldn't be here.

82
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,617
And it's...

83
00:08:41,617 --> 00:08:49,161
Yeah, it's not very frightening, but a little bit, at least.

84
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,102
So it tells you something.

85
00:08:55,818 --> 00:09:01,019
Then if you go to zero, it's like this. It's like clusters of

86
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:09,521
things that you hear that are stacked up randomly in wires.

87
00:09:09,521 --> 00:09:14,622
It's a very nice feature. You can do it any number of ways

88
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:21,884
randomly. And you shouldn't hear much of repeated segments,

89
00:09:21,884 --> 00:09:22,184
but

90
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:26,283
It still comes up, but it works really well.

91
00:09:26,283 --> 00:09:29,145
Up to a certain point, of course.

92
00:09:29,145 --> 00:09:41,615
And then we have wormhole space, which is, if you go there and you hear this,

93
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:44,878
you probably are just frightened. You want to go back.

94
00:09:44,878 --> 00:09:48,000
So that's what it tells you.

95
00:09:49,925 --> 00:09:55,488
You're not flying around and having fun. It's like you shouldn't be alone there.

96
00:09:55,488 --> 00:10:11,477
So we basically want an intelligent music system.

97
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:18,341
Because we can't, or maybe shouldn't.

98
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,586
really precompose all of the elements in a game that ‑‑ or a story that hasn't

99
00:10:24,586 --> 00:10:32,313
taken place? Is it really fair to compose everything in a game that doesn't have a story

100
00:10:32,313 --> 00:10:38,299
that hasn't happened? I think we should find ways of making this better.

101
00:10:40,424 --> 00:10:46,108
Also hearing the same piece of music over and over again diminishes, causes diminishing

102
00:10:46,108 --> 00:10:51,111
aesthetic return and sometimes just makes us ignore it completely.

103
00:10:51,111 --> 00:10:59,958
So even if we had a budget of composing thousands of minutes of music, which is like a million

104
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,699
dollars or something, or two million, I don't know.

105
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:08,812
It will still happen. We will still hear the same thing over and over if we have a game

106
00:11:08,812 --> 00:11:13,915
that plays for more than ten years. That's just going to happen. We will end up with

107
00:11:13,915 --> 00:11:22,220
the repeated segments because of that. So that's why we want an intelligent music

108
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:27,864
system. We want it to be able to create musical material by itself.

109
00:11:29,762 --> 00:11:39,664
So with some help from us, of course, as composers, but it should be able to create the material

110
00:11:39,664 --> 00:11:46,586
according to the atmosphere of the game, though. It should evolve according to the actual progression

111
00:11:46,586 --> 00:11:56,368
in the game in real time. It should be possible to control various musical parameters in music

112
00:11:56,368 --> 00:11:57,168
simultaneously.

113
00:11:58,113 --> 00:12:02,296
This is our wish list that we made. This is what we want.

114
00:12:02,296 --> 00:12:07,900
So the first steps in this direction we took in 2009. This wasn't like, ah, we have to

115
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:15,366
have this tomorrow. We have to have this now. That's not going to happen. And we knew that

116
00:12:15,366 --> 00:12:21,250
it was not going to happen. So it was a side project. We started looking at what others

117
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:26,653
had done, such as EA with Spore and some other nice projects.

118
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:33,212
some really interesting things. We took a look at Max MSP and PT, if we could use that.

119
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:44,676
But we want to have a system that can create real music, not just atmosphere. So it made

120
00:12:44,676 --> 00:12:52,579
it a little bit more complicated. We started researching with Dr. Kertan Olavsson

121
00:12:53,491 --> 00:12:58,136
He was a professor at the Atlantic academy of the arts at the time to find better ways

122
00:12:58,136 --> 00:13:00,619
of playing music in a sandbox game.

123
00:13:00,619 --> 00:13:07,546
We started at the beginnings of music with the basics of music.

124
00:13:07,546 --> 00:13:12,952
Intervals, tempo, rhythm, harmony, et cetera.

125
00:13:12,952 --> 00:13:14,494
And then on to methods.

126
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:23,085
systems such as probability distributions and other methods in order to realize and

127
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:29,289
identify what kind of a system could work. Then we took a look at Kertan's own system,

128
00:13:29,289 --> 00:13:36,873
which he called Kalmus, that system he had been working on for more than 20 years, which

129
00:13:36,873 --> 00:13:38,814
he wrote.

130
00:13:40,602 --> 00:13:48,464
to be able to make contemporary orchestral and instrumental music for himself, really.

131
00:13:48,464 --> 00:13:54,625
And now I'm going to hand the mic over to Kertan, and he's going to tell you a little

132
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:59,806
bit about KalMes.

133
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:01,647
Hello, everyone.

134
00:14:03,335 --> 00:14:11,582
I'm going to speak a little bit about this system and why this system became a composing system.

135
00:14:11,582 --> 00:14:17,528
When I was studying at the Sibelius Academy in Finland in the 80s,

136
00:14:17,528 --> 00:14:23,272
we got the opportunity to work with both professional composers and programmers.

137
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:33,838
And at that time it was possible for normal people to learn how to program with personal computers.

138
00:14:33,838 --> 00:14:40,301
And since in music composition and mathematics has been used for at least a thousand years, as we know,

139
00:14:40,301 --> 00:14:43,983
but most of it was from the last century,

140
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:50,026
we decided to construct a program as my thesis in my doctoral studies there.

141
00:14:51,648 --> 00:14:56,550
And first of all, the idea was to compose, to make a composing program

142
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:04,232
that could use musical elements and materials, as we are doing with pens and papers.

143
00:15:04,232 --> 00:15:15,856
And use these new tools to make experiments with music, try to find new ways to compose music.

144
00:15:15,856 --> 00:15:17,116
And in the end...

145
00:15:20,242 --> 00:15:24,404
We had this program that could compose music for orchestra,

146
00:15:24,404 --> 00:15:27,465
for chamber music, electronic music.

147
00:15:27,465 --> 00:15:36,128
And now today, we are focusing on real time.

148
00:15:37,076 --> 00:15:40,619
composing, which is my interest, actually.

149
00:15:40,619 --> 00:15:46,363
But when the CCP people came to me and we started to talk about this, it was incredible

150
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:50,666
that we were thinking about the same things.

151
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:55,790
A composition for an orchestra is sometimes called three-level composition.

152
00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:00,593
In computer games, music, it's also three levels.

153
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:06,318
Because this system is working with artificial intelligence.

154
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,975
it was obvious that this could be used in a game,

155
00:16:11,975 --> 00:16:13,696
because artificial intelligence,

156
00:16:13,696 --> 00:16:17,397
which I will talk about a little later more,

157
00:16:17,397 --> 00:16:20,919
is something that can handle new situation

158
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:22,899
with new preferences every time,

159
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:23,540
every step in the process.

160
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,720
So a composition with Kalmas is based on musical object,

161
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:25,780
and

162
00:16:35,321 --> 00:16:40,264
We are talking about melodies, harmony, and development,

163
00:16:40,264 --> 00:16:43,446
polyphony, and so on, which is a common concept

164
00:16:43,446 --> 00:16:45,408
in composition without computers as well.

165
00:16:51,192 --> 00:16:55,814
The parameters we are working with are themes,

166
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,995
which we create melodies from,

167
00:16:57,995 --> 00:17:01,377
harmony that will decide what kind of connections

168
00:17:01,377 --> 00:17:02,597
are between the melodies,

169
00:17:02,597 --> 00:17:06,639
scales, which we know mostly today

170
00:17:06,639 --> 00:17:08,620
we are using major and minor,

171
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,702
texture, polyphony, et cetera.

172
00:17:11,702 --> 00:17:16,104
And the musical material is quite traditional,

173
00:17:16,104 --> 00:17:20,306
cells which creates the melody.

174
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,982
and harmony that will connect them together.

175
00:17:23,982 --> 00:17:27,503
And polyphony structures, how they actually are talking

176
00:17:27,503 --> 00:17:28,683
to each other, the melodies.

177
00:17:28,683 --> 00:17:32,004
The algorithms we are using, they take care of putting

178
00:17:32,004 --> 00:17:33,965
together tones for harmony and for melodies.

179
00:17:45,694 --> 00:17:50,458
And we are using, in a very traditional way, different scales.

180
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:55,843
And the scales in our time, they are reflecting a different geographical position, like we

181
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:57,444
have Japanese scales, European scales, and so on.

182
00:17:57,444 --> 00:18:00,466
And the artificial intelligence system makes it possible for the system to go on, to compose

183
00:18:00,466 --> 00:18:00,747
music by itself.

184
00:18:14,378 --> 00:18:20,080
But as we are doing it, the composer using the system

185
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,022
is defining the framework, creating the material,

186
00:18:24,022 --> 00:18:29,444
and deciding what kind of color or texture it will contain.

187
00:18:29,444 --> 00:18:36,806
So, one simple example about artificial intelligence,

188
00:18:36,806 --> 00:18:40,127
when creating a new pitch in melody construction,

189
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,382
And as you can see on this picture,

190
00:18:44,382 --> 00:18:46,824
there are graphic annotation,

191
00:18:46,824 --> 00:18:54,291
there are four notes that are called last pitches

192
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,212
plus a test pitch.

193
00:18:57,413 --> 00:19:02,297
And these pitches, they are compared to the input cell from the composer.

194
00:19:02,297 --> 00:19:10,724
And the program is deciding what are the relations between this new pitch in this new melodic

195
00:19:10,724 --> 00:19:15,068
line according to the actual input cell from the composer.

196
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:19,515
And what happens when it finally is accepted,

197
00:19:19,515 --> 00:19:23,617
after having been compared to what kind of scale,

198
00:19:23,617 --> 00:19:27,039
what kind of interval are preferred,

199
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,441
then the new pitch is accepted,

200
00:19:30,441 --> 00:19:35,763
and there's a new situation in the middle construction.

201
00:19:35,763 --> 00:19:40,286
And that means that the program has to continue

202
00:19:40,286 --> 00:19:44,248
to make another selection according to this new situation.

203
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:49,382
And this is called artificial intelligence in music creation.

204
00:19:49,382 --> 00:19:58,929
The same things or quite similar things are happening in the computer game, like sandbox

205
00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:02,691
as they are working with, working on.

206
00:20:02,691 --> 00:20:07,555
It is something happens in the game and a new situation have occurred.

207
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:14,062
And then the program like this can actually decide,

208
00:20:14,062 --> 00:20:16,003
we have to change the musical texture

209
00:20:16,003 --> 00:20:18,943
and prepare for another development of the music.

210
00:20:18,943 --> 00:20:20,003
And to do this, we made several project

211
00:20:20,003 --> 00:20:21,164
just to connect this computer composing system

212
00:20:21,164 --> 00:20:21,464
to the actual game.

213
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:38,071
And the first one is called Kalmas Waves,

214
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:42,033
which is we are using dances to control the program.

215
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:45,575
And this Kalmas program can be controlled.

216
00:20:45,575 --> 00:20:50,997
Each parameter can be changed in real time,

217
00:20:50,997 --> 00:20:54,058
which means that we can take music from the 20th century,

218
00:20:54,058 --> 00:20:58,980
change the harmony and the polyphonic structure,

219
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:02,762
and we can go back in time to the 15th century

220
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,763
by doing this without changing the material.

221
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:12,972
And to do this we created, constructed a census connected to the dances and the dances are

222
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:15,755
sending messages to the program that will compose according to their movements.

223
00:21:15,755 --> 00:21:18,617
This is what we can use in the computer games, taking messages from the games and use the

224
00:21:18,617 --> 00:21:20,980
message to compose music according to what is happening.

225
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:44,080
The second thing we did is called Kalmus Play, which is kind of an app for fun to create

226
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:51,103
very simple music. And what this is doing, it's this simple app is communicating with

227
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:54,444
the program, a special version of the program, which is on the server in Europe, in Iceland,

228
00:22:00,388 --> 00:22:03,969
And this small app can compose music.

229
00:22:03,969 --> 00:22:12,912
So if I press this button, it will send a simple message to the server and compose the

230
00:22:12,912 --> 00:22:15,673
music and send it back.

231
00:22:15,673 --> 00:22:18,974
This is composed in Iceland.

232
00:22:18,974 --> 00:22:21,014
Very simple.

233
00:22:21,014 --> 00:22:26,996
Very primitive.

234
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:35,435
This is how we are just trying to communicate with the server, just through TCP, through

235
00:22:35,435 --> 00:22:40,606
the satellites and telephone system.

236
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:46,268
And then a small example from the actual use of the program.

237
00:22:46,268 --> 00:22:54,710
With this program I have composed and other composers different kinds of music.

238
00:22:54,710 --> 00:23:01,752
And one of the music is called Viola Concerto, which is for a full orchestra and a solo viola.

239
00:23:01,752 --> 00:23:03,252
And I just play a small example from this piece.

240
00:23:03,252 --> 00:23:04,732
This is the end of the piece.

241
00:23:12,822 --> 00:23:25,433
It's a live recording from the Icelandic Symphony Orchestra.

242
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:05,710
And this is a screen shot of the actual program.

243
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:05,770
And...

244
00:24:08,602 --> 00:24:14,864
I'm trying to change now, so I'll go into the program and show you a little bit about

245
00:24:14,864 --> 00:24:18,306
how it's possible to use individual parameters. So I have to leave this. So yeah, it comes

246
00:24:18,306 --> 00:24:21,127
here. So this blue box is actually a musical object, and it's containing a couple of melodies.

247
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,241
and it can be played.

248
00:24:38,241 --> 00:24:39,843
Very simple things from it.

249
00:24:39,843 --> 00:24:51,213
And it's possible to enter the material from the composers

250
00:24:51,213 --> 00:24:59,521
through MIDI files to play directly into the program

251
00:24:59,521 --> 00:25:02,584
and to export as well as the MIDI files.

252
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:06,336
But this interface is made in Xcode.

253
00:25:06,336 --> 00:25:09,059
It's communicating with the actual program,

254
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:11,881
the same program as is used for CalMOS Play

255
00:25:11,881 --> 00:25:13,463
and for this computer game.

256
00:25:13,463 --> 00:25:16,666
It's only communicating with the numbers.

257
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:20,250
So when I press the button Play, it sends the number 50

258
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:24,414
to the actual brain, which starts to play.

259
00:25:24,414 --> 00:25:27,657
And all these parameters we can see here.

260
00:25:29,801 --> 00:25:36,644
a very traditional deciding what kind of intervals we are using in the harmony, what kind of

261
00:25:36,644 --> 00:25:44,148
polyphony we are using, and polyphony is kind of if it's canon or if everybody is playing

262
00:25:44,148 --> 00:25:52,312
together and this is very traditional for a composer to work with. And then we can decide

263
00:25:52,312 --> 00:25:52,953
in the melody.

264
00:25:55,173 --> 00:25:56,894
what kind of scales we are using.

265
00:25:56,894 --> 00:26:00,295
And whole tone scale is very well known from Debussy

266
00:26:00,295 --> 00:26:01,735
and other composers.

267
00:26:01,735 --> 00:26:06,777
And here, it can be changed, the scales.

268
00:26:06,777 --> 00:26:09,998
We can do this one.

269
00:26:09,998 --> 00:26:11,438
When it's red, it's composing.

270
00:26:11,438 --> 00:26:15,299
It's within a second, it has changed.

271
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:16,960
Now we have a different situation.

272
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,721
And of course, all the instrument can be selected here.

273
00:26:20,721 --> 00:26:24,022
Or any electronic.

274
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:39,383
instruments. And this is the editor for the material that can be used in the computer

275
00:26:39,383 --> 00:26:44,884
game for the composers. The game can then afterwards use this material and use it in

276
00:26:44,884 --> 00:26:46,364
the game. And that's about it from me.

277
00:26:58,134 --> 00:27:02,579
So, Baldur, you will continue. Thank you.

278
00:27:17,862 --> 00:27:24,085
We also need to know the game that we are working with. We have to know what to look

279
00:27:24,085 --> 00:27:29,767
for in the game. Since we don't have a story, we have to find other ways, other means of

280
00:27:29,767 --> 00:27:36,150
creating music. So we don't have a single character or story to build the music on,

281
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:45,113
but we have other things. In EVE we have different races of people. We have different environments.

282
00:27:46,035 --> 00:27:52,358
These are things that we can use. We have wormholes. We have cosmic signatures and other

283
00:27:52,358 --> 00:28:01,883
anomalies. And we have other players as well as some NPC players as well. But there are

284
00:28:01,883 --> 00:28:05,525
no scripted stories at all. So we have to work with these things.

285
00:28:12,453 --> 00:28:20,517
territories. So each when you start out, each race has a certain territory that they start

286
00:28:20,517 --> 00:28:29,843
in. So four territories that you get to choose from, so instead of connecting to a single

287
00:28:29,843 --> 00:28:35,726
character, which is usually pretty straightforward for a composer to connect to a type of a character

288
00:28:35,726 --> 00:28:37,747
and compose some music for it.

289
00:28:38,642 --> 00:28:42,743
we connect to the whole race. So we take the character and connect this character to the

290
00:28:42,743 --> 00:28:50,366
whole race. And we connect this, what we created, to this whole territory in the space. So it

291
00:28:50,366 --> 00:28:56,268
works in a similar way. So we have four basic races that we get to

292
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:58,228
choose from when we start.

293
00:29:01,265 --> 00:29:08,991
In order to understand how the music can be defined for the races, it's vital to really

294
00:29:08,991 --> 00:29:14,635
understand and study each race on its own. We have Amar, Galente, Kaldari and Minmatar.

295
00:29:14,635 --> 00:29:22,941
These are what the races are called. And all of these have a different kind of

296
00:29:22,941 --> 00:29:26,524
back story or history which is written.

297
00:29:27,556 --> 00:29:33,460
doesn't really mean a lot, but it's there. And we can use it as composers. And as well,

298
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:38,704
they look different, so we can use that as well.

299
00:29:38,704 --> 00:29:47,090
And as you see, we've found some ways of defining the characters Amar, Noble, Regala, a little

300
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:52,635
bit evil, they were slaveholders once. Galente, smooth and curvy, they're French.

301
00:29:54,185 --> 00:30:02,092
Caldari are hard and edgy, cold, very technical. And Minmet are rusty and a bit dirty, you

302
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:06,515
know, rock and roll, almost. And we also have some NPC races, Jove, they're mysterious,

303
00:30:06,515 --> 00:30:17,945
and they're hugely advanced to any other race. We don't really know what they can do. They

304
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:26,656
They're just like gods, almost. They're there. We can use them to create some music for situations

305
00:30:26,656 --> 00:30:32,100
or have our system create music for situations with them in it. And we have some pirate factions

306
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:39,266
as well. Many different pirate factions, actually. So we can actually have many different kinds

307
00:30:39,266 --> 00:30:43,469
of things for the pirate factions because they are very different. They also have a

308
00:30:43,469 --> 00:30:43,990
back story.

309
00:30:45,673 --> 00:30:54,497
There's a lot of material to be able to base the music on, so to speak.

310
00:30:54,497 --> 00:31:07,021
So six to ten races that we can define for music and we can start creating something

311
00:31:07,021 --> 00:31:10,843
we would like to call a character cell for each race.

312
00:31:10,843 --> 00:31:14,724
And for the game we just make a specific library.

313
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:25,207
Let's look at the first one. It's regular noble, a bit evil perhaps. Some would disagree,

314
00:31:25,207 --> 00:31:32,768
but I don't know. I feel they're pretty bad. The principal melodies, I mean, this could

315
00:31:32,768 --> 00:31:39,149
be anything. It's up to us to define it as composers. So thirds and sixths scale Dorian

316
00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:44,330
with the raised sixth on the minor scale.

317
00:31:45,475 --> 00:31:52,602
around C2, the pitch registry, and the speed around Adagio or something like that. And

318
00:31:52,602 --> 00:32:00,589
polyphonic structure is like this or it could be canon, horizontal, vertical distribution.

319
00:32:00,589 --> 00:32:04,112
And the instrument texture also is important.

320
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:11,045
So we haven't really made ‑‑ set any of this in stone. We took a look at all of

321
00:32:11,045 --> 00:32:18,788
them and it also really matters how they sound. It's not enough to think this, well, yes,

322
00:32:18,788 --> 00:32:23,530
this guy is really sinister. It's a minor second, definitely. Well, it has to work in

323
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:27,852
the game with other things as well. So we have to try it out. So we're in the process

324
00:32:27,852 --> 00:32:28,833
of doing this now.

325
00:32:31,898 --> 00:32:38,064
And, yeah, the instrument texture mixed, meaning classical and some electronic instruments

326
00:32:38,064 --> 00:32:50,996
together. And now we have to find things in the game that can change things in the music.

327
00:32:50,996 --> 00:32:56,501
So what can, for example, interval changes in harmony can be changed by various tensions

328
00:32:56,501 --> 00:32:56,942
in the game.

329
00:32:57,832 --> 00:33:06,000
I mean, Kalmus can change, do interval changes in the harmony depending on various tensions

330
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,101
in the game in real time.

331
00:33:07,101 --> 00:33:08,303
This is important.

332
00:33:08,303 --> 00:33:15,009
Also type of polyphony, complexity and conflicts, this could be anything again.

333
00:33:15,009 --> 00:33:20,635
We are just in the process of defining it, so it's really exciting to be able to do that.

334
00:33:22,517 --> 00:33:26,081
Changing tempo is tension as well, emerging threats, more

335
00:33:26,081 --> 00:33:30,386
tempo, there's a threat coming, there's more tempo. It's really

336
00:33:30,386 --> 00:33:33,390
straightforward if you think about it. It's similar to if you

337
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:36,613
just compose with a story.

338
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:46,871
So we have an example. I'm going to play an example that lasts for, I think, six minutes.

339
00:33:46,871 --> 00:33:56,216
But it's nice. I put some explanations and I'll talk over it maybe. It explains how the

340
00:33:56,216 --> 00:34:02,979
music changes while you play. And also let you hear how the program composes in real

341
00:34:02,979 --> 00:34:04,760
time. It's a video.

342
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:13,433
It was supposed to be plan B because we weren't sure if we were going to be able to play live

343
00:34:13,433 --> 00:34:18,115
here, but it sounds or looks like we are able to play live. So we're just going to play

344
00:34:18,115 --> 00:34:23,917
both. I'm going to do plan B first and then we're going to listen to plan A in the end.

345
00:34:23,917 --> 00:34:30,559
So we'll have it realtime over the server. So this is AMAR again that we defined. You

346
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:32,560
will hear the definition I made.

347
00:34:35,143 --> 00:34:42,267
Melodies, thirds and sixths. I have for ‑‑ what Kalmas can do, it can forbid some intervals.

348
00:34:42,267 --> 00:34:47,869
So I have forbidden intervals just for normal minor seconds and major sevenths, which is

349
00:34:47,869 --> 00:34:54,813
basically the same thing. But the Dorian and the Daccio and the mixed instrumental selection.

350
00:34:54,813 --> 00:35:02,237
Then a danger occurs and the interval changes, change really, because it allows every interval

351
00:35:02,237 --> 00:35:02,897
to be played.

352
00:35:04,347 --> 00:35:10,793
and it gets a little bit lower and the instrument gets a little bit changed as well. But the

353
00:35:10,793 --> 00:35:18,840
same melody again. Then we'll jump into another system and there you will hear a different

354
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:25,305
thing. But still being composed in realtime. So let's hear what this sounds like.

355
00:36:37,264 --> 00:36:54,698
This is all single-player, so there's not much happening. I will find some pirates attack me, but that's about it

356
00:38:11,592 --> 00:38:19,650
So there we have the intervals, there are no intervals spanned any longer and the instrumentation is changed.

357
00:39:37,365 --> 00:39:44,615
So now it finishes what it is playing, it finishes the segment and starts the next one

358
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:45,756
when it warps out.

359
00:39:45,756 --> 00:39:47,619
But it finishes this one first.

360
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:49,661
It doesn't happen right away.

361
00:39:49,661 --> 00:39:52,986
Could let it happen right away, but that's not how it happens right now.

362
00:40:22,376 --> 00:40:24,580
back again to where we started.

363
00:41:05,631 --> 00:41:07,633
So now we're in the Galente system.

364
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:13,878
And we are hearing a different thing altogether.

365
00:41:50,197 --> 00:41:55,399
Of course, everything is done in realtime, so there's no editing done here.

366
00:41:55,399 --> 00:41:59,021
So we're done with that.

367
00:41:59,021 --> 00:42:05,143
Now we're going to play some realtime Plan A.

368
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:27,224
So this is also on a local server, so just one player, maybe with some NPC pirates attacking

369
00:42:27,224 --> 00:42:37,370
or something. But this is in real time now. So over VPN. So maybe a little bit of disturbance,

370
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:45,556
I don't know. So again, Kalmus is written in Lisp.

371
00:42:46,283 --> 00:42:52,349
It runs in ECL, which is an open source interpreter for Common Lisp.

372
00:42:52,349 --> 00:42:58,695
And we worked with Audio Kinetic to open its API,

373
00:42:58,695 --> 00:43:03,180
so we could send MIDI events into the sound engine.

374
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,802
It was really important.

375
00:43:05,802 --> 00:43:07,384
But now it's open for everyone.

376
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:10,406
They're just including it in their Wwise thing.

377
00:43:12,163 --> 00:43:16,485
So CalMES feeds the MIDI events into Wwise, which hosts the instruments.

378
00:43:16,485 --> 00:43:20,088
We have the sampler and Wwise play the instrument there.

379
00:43:47,466 --> 00:43:54,248
The music in here, I mean, it's probably, would probably have some percussion and stuff like that there, but it's all work in progress.

380
00:43:54,248 --> 00:44:09,592
But it's all in real time and the potential, you can hear the potential is there and it changes while you play the game. It evolves.

381
00:44:49,244 --> 00:44:52,667
There's some traffic.

382
00:44:52,667 --> 00:45:14,001
It's a local server.

383
00:45:14,001 --> 00:45:17,604
But there it is.

384
00:45:34,819 --> 00:45:45,368
So there we are. I don't think we have to ‑‑ if you want to hear this, take a better look at

385
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:52,574
this. We'll be at the Autokinetic booth later today after this. We'll set this up and demo it.

386
00:45:52,574 --> 00:46:00,841
You can listen for your own with headphones maybe. But for now I think that's it. Yeah.

387
00:46:10,133 --> 00:46:16,758
So in summary, for Sandbox MMO where the story hasn't happened, we'd greatly prefer non‑

388
00:46:16,758 --> 00:46:24,423
precomposed music. Some kind of a system is needed, we think. One such system is Kalmus,

389
00:46:24,423 --> 00:46:30,187
obviously. But no system can work without first really knowing what you're dealing with,

390
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:34,390
knowing the game. You have to know the game that you're dealing with, what to look for.

391
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:37,673
And currently the system runs outside twice, but

392
00:46:38,217 --> 00:46:42,604
Ideally we're going to have a plug-in so we can use it with

393
00:46:42,604 --> 00:46:47,373
other games that we're making. So thank you. And some

394
00:46:47,373 --> 00:46:47,853
questions.

395
00:46:50,681 --> 00:46:57,165
Hi, thank you so much. That was fascinating to hear an explanation about and to watch

396
00:46:57,165 --> 00:47:03,130
in action. Thank you so much. I have two quick questions. First of all, with the percussion

397
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:08,433
that you mentioned just briefly, maybe you could talk some about your vision for how

398
00:47:08,433 --> 00:47:15,298
that could play out with the different territories or especially with the different races within

399
00:47:15,298 --> 00:47:15,638
the game.

400
00:47:17,985 --> 00:47:25,430
I think with percussion, you're talking about percussion? Yes. I think mainly with when

401
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:29,333
there is danger and you're attacked, that's what we're starting with. We're not going

402
00:47:29,333 --> 00:47:36,519
to tie it to a race to start with at least. So like I said, it's a game, it's an in‑progress

403
00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:41,883
thing. We're still trying out things. And to start with, I think we're going to tie

404
00:47:41,883 --> 00:47:44,605
percussion with when you're attacked and stuff like that. Yeah.

405
00:47:46,273 --> 00:47:53,616
My second question is about forbidden intervals. I was maybe a little bit confused and I was

406
00:47:53,616 --> 00:47:58,377
wondering does that work horizontally or vertically?

407
00:47:58,377 --> 00:48:05,379
Yeah. It can work for harmony. So what I was showing you was for the harmony. So it was

408
00:48:05,379 --> 00:48:13,502
not the melody. So you can forbid intervals in melody as well. But it didn't do that.

409
00:48:13,502 --> 00:48:14,902
So this was all for the harmony.

410
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:16,794
Thank you so much.

411
00:48:16,794 --> 00:48:16,914
Yeah.

412
00:48:16,914 --> 00:48:17,195
Hi, you're right.

413
00:48:17,195 --> 00:48:20,638
That sounds like a fantastic system, so great work on that.

414
00:48:20,638 --> 00:48:22,900
I've got two very quick questions.

415
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:32,809
It sounds really fantastic to be able to have this great, sprawling soundscape that never

416
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:34,610
repeats and kind of generates itself.

417
00:48:35,251 --> 00:48:41,056
on its own but as an audio designer and a composer sometimes there can be a really great value in

418
00:48:41,056 --> 00:48:46,581
having a repetition of some sounds in terms of feeding back to the player when they've done

419
00:48:46,581 --> 00:48:52,947
something in the right way or feeding back to the player. This is absolute game over situation or

420
00:48:52,947 --> 00:48:57,191
this is you're absolutely fine and for something that shifts so much.

421
00:48:57,672 --> 00:49:01,795
and can be interpreted until it's settled on what it is.

422
00:49:01,795 --> 00:49:05,658
Do you think there's still space on a project like your own

423
00:49:05,658 --> 00:49:08,580
for a composer to still have a kind of finite,

424
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:10,902
this is what we require for certain times of the game,

425
00:49:10,902 --> 00:49:12,844
or are you intending on having the whole thing

426
00:49:12,844 --> 00:49:13,444
to be open and free?

427
00:49:13,444 --> 00:49:16,067
Yeah, so I totally understand your question.

428
00:49:16,067 --> 00:49:17,928
I was hoping for this question, actually.

429
00:49:17,928 --> 00:49:18,889
Okay.

430
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:23,793
So I think the system can be used for,

431
00:49:23,793 --> 00:49:25,294
as a hybrid system as well.

432
00:49:26,154 --> 00:49:31,982
as you can tell it to play a certain thing and then you can compose your thing in the

433
00:49:31,982 --> 00:49:40,754
same scale and have it play over it. Also about repetition, we can have it repeat, but

434
00:49:40,754 --> 00:49:41,374
it will always

435
00:49:43,565 --> 00:49:53,929
change it a tiny bit. So you can tell it there's a certain slider there that you can move which

436
00:49:53,929 --> 00:49:57,730
is called ratio of truth. So if you move it to 100 percent it will play what you ask it.

437
00:49:57,730 --> 00:50:03,592
So if you have it like 50 percent it will kind of play what you asked. So it will play

438
00:50:03,592 --> 00:50:04,832
something else as well.

439
00:50:05,614 --> 00:50:13,779
So we plan to be able to use it, you know, if we want to use it as a hybrid system, you

440
00:50:13,779 --> 00:50:14,859
should be able to.

441
00:50:14,859 --> 00:50:14,959
Yes.

442
00:50:14,959 --> 00:50:15,900
Definitely.

443
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:16,180
Fantastic.

444
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:21,323
One last little question, just something I was wondering.

445
00:50:21,323 --> 00:50:25,526
Sometimes when I'm using MIDI instruments, I find that obviously they have their limitations.

446
00:50:26,287 --> 00:50:30,209
It's like a violin, it can only go so high and so low, and what have you?

447
00:50:30,209 --> 00:50:34,211
Have you had any problems with that, with the MIDI instruments, where it's tried to

448
00:50:34,211 --> 00:50:36,792
compose something outside of the range of the actual instrumentation?

449
00:50:36,792 --> 00:50:39,994
So maybe, Kertan, you can maybe answer that, that's really, the system really knows how

450
00:50:39,994 --> 00:50:41,154
to deal with this.

451
00:50:41,154 --> 00:50:41,454
Yeah.

452
00:50:41,454 --> 00:50:41,635
Yeah.

453
00:50:41,635 --> 00:50:41,795
Yeah.

454
00:50:41,795 --> 00:50:41,975
Yeah.

455
00:50:41,975 --> 00:50:42,135
Yeah.

456
00:50:42,135 --> 00:50:42,235
Yeah.

457
00:50:42,235 --> 00:50:42,375
Yeah.

458
00:50:42,375 --> 00:50:42,535
Yeah.

459
00:50:42,535 --> 00:50:42,615
Yeah.

460
00:50:42,615 --> 00:50:42,755
Yeah.

461
00:50:42,755 --> 00:50:42,935
Yeah.

462
00:50:42,935 --> 00:50:43,015
Yeah.

463
00:50:43,015 --> 00:50:43,095
Yeah.

464
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:51,738
Yeah, actually the program is made for traditional instruments and it has 16 MIDI channels

465
00:50:51,738 --> 00:51:00,622
and the MIDI channels are assigned to the traditional instrument of an orchestra, I mean symphony orchestra.

466
00:51:00,622 --> 00:51:03,603
So number 1 is the flute and number 16 is the double bass.

467
00:51:04,605 --> 00:51:09,950
So there is kind of sections in the classical symphony.

468
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:11,771
It's one to four is the woodwinds,

469
00:51:11,771 --> 00:51:16,154
and five to eight is the brass,

470
00:51:16,154 --> 00:51:18,216
and then there's a percussion,

471
00:51:18,216 --> 00:51:21,399
and the last five are the strings.

472
00:51:21,399 --> 00:51:25,182
Two violins, viola cello and double bass.

473
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:27,143
But the thing that we are doing in this

474
00:51:27,143 --> 00:51:30,926
is to construct sounds that are

475
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:35,481
that are similar to, for example, for a flute.

476
00:51:35,481 --> 00:51:38,522
And the program can take care of the woodwinds

477
00:51:38,522 --> 00:51:39,702
and take care of the harmonies.

478
00:51:39,702 --> 00:51:41,842
A different harmony that you use on the woodwinds

479
00:51:41,842 --> 00:51:45,223
than on the lower register instruments.

480
00:51:45,223 --> 00:51:49,804
So that's the thing that is, we are creating artificial,

481
00:51:49,804 --> 00:51:53,165
well not artificial, but electronic symphonic orchestra

482
00:51:53,165 --> 00:51:54,965
so we can apply all the functions

483
00:51:54,965 --> 00:51:58,846
were actually made for the traditional symphonic orchestra.

484
00:51:59,526 --> 00:52:02,630
on electronic sounds as they are creating in CCP.

485
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:06,976
So it's taking care of all the ranges for the instruments

486
00:52:06,976 --> 00:52:10,861
and playing with the range of each instrument together.

487
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:11,582
Awesome, great job guys.

488
00:52:16,672 --> 00:52:21,717
Hi there. I was wondering, so it's obviously very early, what

489
00:52:21,717 --> 00:52:24,339
you're working on, but are you planning on expanding the palette

490
00:52:24,339 --> 00:52:25,700
of instruments that you're working on? I know you just

491
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:28,963
mentioned that you're using all just like a regular orchestra and

492
00:52:28,963 --> 00:52:32,666
stuff like that. Have you run into any problems with the

493
00:52:32,666 --> 00:52:35,409
program itself, like as far as mixing like the instruments

494
00:52:35,409 --> 00:52:40,854
together or having like playback issues with that and having it

495
00:52:40,854 --> 00:52:44,197
meshed with the game audio itself when it's playing back?

496
00:52:44,917 --> 00:52:47,258
Yeah, I don't think we're there quite yet.

497
00:52:47,258 --> 00:52:49,659
I mean, we are playing around with instruments.

498
00:52:49,659 --> 00:52:52,141
We're creating instruments ourselves and hearing what

499
00:52:52,141 --> 00:52:52,581
works.

500
00:52:52,581 --> 00:52:58,644
I mean, we've had some problems, but we haven't really,

501
00:52:58,644 --> 00:53:02,946
we're not really there to tell you that this is how we fix

502
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:05,288
this and this is how we fix that.

503
00:53:05,288 --> 00:53:07,169
No, we're not quite right there.

504
00:53:07,169 --> 00:53:09,690
But as Kertan stated before.

505
00:53:10,428 --> 00:53:15,872
If you are a composer and you know how to use the system, I think you kind of need to

506
00:53:15,872 --> 00:53:18,393
be a composer if you want to use the system.

507
00:53:18,393 --> 00:53:22,155
Not just anyone can just step in and just use it.

508
00:53:22,155 --> 00:53:28,319
It's just ‑‑ it's not ‑‑ maybe Kerstin disagrees, but I think ‑‑

509
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:29,740
I can add to it.

510
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:31,161
But yeah, he wants to add to it.

511
00:53:31,161 --> 00:53:36,464
But yeah, we're not quite there, but, you know, the instruments know where they should

512
00:53:36,464 --> 00:53:36,704
be.

513
00:53:36,704 --> 00:53:38,065
But yeah, Kerstin wants to ‑‑

514
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:45,954
I can maybe add to this, all the functions in the system are made for musical purpose.

515
00:53:45,954 --> 00:53:51,358
It's like controlling harmony, controlling the tension and color and melodic development.

516
00:53:51,358 --> 00:53:56,001
And this is very important, even uses are not.

517
00:53:56,582 --> 00:54:00,022
educated on the highest level in composition.

518
00:54:00,022 --> 00:54:03,063
If you have good ears and you have a good sense for music,

519
00:54:03,063 --> 00:54:04,443
you can learn from the system

520
00:54:04,443 --> 00:54:07,744
because it's always react to what you're doing.

521
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:10,045
So it's a kind of new way of composing music.

522
00:54:10,045 --> 00:54:13,726
You are dealing and communicating with a composing system

523
00:54:13,726 --> 00:54:15,226
and experiment with this.

524
00:54:15,226 --> 00:54:15,506
Thank you.

525
00:54:18,324 --> 00:54:24,711
Yes, and I also think that it's a great way to, at least for me, to get ideas.

526
00:54:24,711 --> 00:54:31,318
To put something in and it spits something out in like a second or something and you're

527
00:54:31,318 --> 00:54:32,619
like amazed.

528
00:54:32,619 --> 00:54:33,681
I didn't think of that.

529
00:54:33,681 --> 00:54:34,682
That's a great idea.

530
00:54:34,682 --> 00:54:37,465
That's one thing about the system that I love.

531
00:54:38,588 --> 00:54:39,168
Yes.

532
00:54:39,168 --> 00:54:41,229
Hello, thank you for the talk.

533
00:54:41,229 --> 00:54:44,431
I was interested to know a bit more

534
00:54:44,431 --> 00:54:48,373
about the technical side of how you used Wwise as a sampler

535
00:54:48,373 --> 00:54:53,135
because sample symphonic instruments

536
00:54:53,135 --> 00:54:55,056
are quite complicated, right?

537
00:54:55,056 --> 00:54:58,298
You have different articulations and different timbres

538
00:54:58,298 --> 00:54:59,699
depending on, for example, the...

539
00:55:00,259 --> 00:55:04,402
the intensity of the breath, and then you should have different samples to avoid repetition.

540
00:55:04,402 --> 00:55:09,746
So I guess this is a lot of work, so I wanted to know how deep did you go into that sampling

541
00:55:09,746 --> 00:55:11,667
aspect in WISE?

542
00:55:11,667 --> 00:55:12,728
We did not go deep.

543
00:55:12,728 --> 00:55:15,350
It's very short and sweet.

544
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:18,592
We just took some samples and we did not go deep.

545
00:55:18,592 --> 00:55:19,993
We are thinking about this.

546
00:55:19,993 --> 00:55:20,133
Okay.

547
00:55:20,453 --> 00:55:27,097
And we are going to probably start a project just about this, because it's really important.

548
00:55:27,097 --> 00:55:32,639
I, myself, think that it's almost impossible to play a classical instrument really fast

549
00:55:32,639 --> 00:55:33,339
by a machine.

550
00:55:33,339 --> 00:55:39,902
It's, at least, it's very, it's not, it doesn't sound right to my ears, at least.

551
00:55:39,902 --> 00:55:42,964
So I want to really work on that.

552
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:46,866
And we, no, we haven't really worked on it.

553
00:55:46,866 --> 00:55:49,527
Maybe we'll work with someone that is already doing that.

554
00:55:51,511 --> 00:55:55,757
We don't know yet. Like I said, it's all a work in progress.

555
00:55:55,757 --> 00:55:58,421
These were the samples that we put in.

556
00:55:58,421 --> 00:56:05,391
But remarkably, you know, I think it sounded remarkably well just using the basic sampler in Wwise and just playback.

557
00:56:06,877 --> 00:56:09,019
Okay, and if you want to go deeper into that,

558
00:56:09,019 --> 00:56:11,061
would you need to redefine a bit the algorithm

559
00:56:11,061 --> 00:56:13,624
to integrate more parameters, like for example,

560
00:56:13,624 --> 00:56:17,729
dynamics and stuff like that?

561
00:56:17,729 --> 00:56:20,352
Or do you think it already has everything

562
00:56:20,352 --> 00:56:22,955
to handle that kind of deeper sampling technology?

563
00:56:23,595 --> 00:56:25,377
You mean the samples?

564
00:56:25,377 --> 00:56:31,362
Yeah, I mean if you really go deeper into the, like having more samples and more parameters,

565
00:56:31,362 --> 00:56:36,806
we do need to rework a bit on the algorithm to integrate those new parameters.

566
00:56:36,806 --> 00:56:38,347
Yeah, so we're not there yet.

567
00:56:38,347 --> 00:56:39,008
Okay, yeah.

568
00:56:39,008 --> 00:56:40,409
Yeah, we're not there, definitely not.

569
00:56:40,409 --> 00:56:40,949
Okay, okay.

570
00:56:40,949 --> 00:56:45,733
So, like I said, that's material for a whole new project, I think.

571
00:56:45,733 --> 00:56:46,213
Okay.

572
00:56:46,213 --> 00:56:49,476
Because it's so important to have them sound right.

573
00:56:49,476 --> 00:56:51,077
Okay, thank you so much.

574
00:56:51,077 --> 00:56:51,277
Yeah.

575
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,154
Hi, thank you.

576
00:56:55,154 --> 00:56:58,177
So what's the plan for the evolution

577
00:56:58,177 --> 00:57:00,019
of different classical styles?

578
00:57:00,019 --> 00:57:02,661
So you gave a really great example,

579
00:57:02,661 --> 00:57:05,163
and this is working really well for Eve.

580
00:57:05,163 --> 00:57:08,306
And I'm wondering how deep do you think

581
00:57:08,306 --> 00:57:11,408
the technology can go in the future for,

582
00:57:11,408 --> 00:57:13,770
can you make it sound Baroque,

583
00:57:13,770 --> 00:57:17,434
or can you make it sound like John Williams,

584
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:21,477
or how far do you think we can go with this AI composition?

585
00:57:21,757 --> 00:57:24,698
So if I start maybe, maybe Kerstin can continue.

586
00:57:24,698 --> 00:57:32,960
When we started with this, it was able to play back for us what we put in, it played

587
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:37,081
back really complicated 20th century music.

588
00:57:37,081 --> 00:57:42,522
That's not really what we're looking for, at least in a ‑‑ mostly we're looking

589
00:57:42,522 --> 00:57:45,343
for something more simple.

590
00:57:47,651 --> 00:57:56,076
So we're quite, I think we have quite made a lot of success

591
00:57:56,076 --> 00:58:02,279
making it, make, create simpler passages of music.

592
00:58:02,279 --> 00:58:05,901
As far as you're talking about maybe it can compose

593
00:58:05,901 --> 00:58:07,362
John Williams or something like that.

594
00:58:07,362 --> 00:58:09,643
I don't see why not.

595
00:58:09,643 --> 00:58:13,065
If we create the right cells for it

596
00:58:13,065 --> 00:58:16,807
and the input has to be right.

597
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:26,134
and it has to be, has the right tempo and so on, then I don't see why not. Maybe Kertan

598
00:58:26,134 --> 00:58:26,634
wants to add to it.

599
00:58:26,634 --> 00:58:36,942
Yeah, maybe the methods and the algorithms in this program, they can handle different

600
00:58:36,942 --> 00:58:44,228
type of music and you cannot do our kind of back fugue in this or you cannot, you cannot

601
00:58:44,428 --> 00:58:47,189
it's not meant to imitate styles,

602
00:58:47,189 --> 00:58:49,949
but you can certainly get the color of the styles,

603
00:58:49,949 --> 00:58:52,310
like you can control the harmony,

604
00:58:52,310 --> 00:58:56,431
you can, as very consonant based on triads,

605
00:58:56,431 --> 00:58:59,532
using melodic cells that are very connected

606
00:58:59,532 --> 00:59:03,853
to the classical periods in the music history.

607
00:59:03,853 --> 00:59:06,494
So you can get kind of color of it,

608
00:59:06,494 --> 00:59:09,234
but it's not meant to imitate.

609
00:59:10,135 --> 00:59:13,796
And I can tell you something because I've used this

610
00:59:13,796 --> 00:59:17,216
for teaching contemporary music at the academy

611
00:59:17,216 --> 00:59:19,017
for many, many years.

612
00:59:19,017 --> 00:59:22,798
And obviously the students, they can,

613
00:59:22,798 --> 00:59:25,818
after some time, they can actually control the system

614
00:59:25,818 --> 00:59:29,759
in the personal way, which is very important.

615
00:59:29,759 --> 00:59:32,740
And I was once very surprised when one of the students

616
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:35,220
could actually make a minimalistic music,

617
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:36,741
which I didn't think was possible.

618
00:59:38,588 --> 00:59:43,531
adjusting the parameters and knowing the symbol and the

619
00:59:43,531 --> 00:59:46,792
character of the music, you can get there.

620
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:49,114
Nick.

621
00:59:49,114 --> 00:59:51,295
Hi, thank you for the presentation.

622
00:59:51,295 --> 00:59:54,516
I'm a data scientist so I was pretty fascinated

623
00:59:54,516 --> 00:59:56,977
about the AI aspect of this.

624
00:59:56,977 --> 01:00:00,199
So I was wondering if you guys ever consider using

625
01:00:00,199 --> 01:00:02,820
player input to train the system?

626
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:09,743
For example, if you play something during a combat and you have a button to click, if

627
01:00:09,743 --> 01:00:15,086
this is, if the player thinks it matches the mood, it actually feeds back to the system

628
01:00:15,086 --> 01:00:21,309
of the AI and train the system that way. Have you guys thought about it before?

629
01:00:21,309 --> 01:00:25,671
No, we have not. But I don't see why we shouldn't be able to do something like that.

630
01:00:26,458 --> 01:00:30,120
We're not there yet, but I don't see why not.

631
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:35,422
I don't see why the, so we create a cell of maybe eight

632
01:00:35,422 --> 01:00:41,644
notes for Kalmers to compose music to, or it reaches eight

633
01:00:41,644 --> 01:00:43,825
notes and creates music.

634
01:00:43,825 --> 01:00:48,126
I don't see why not the system or the game would be able to

635
01:00:48,126 --> 01:00:49,887
create these eight notes somehow.

636
01:00:49,887 --> 01:00:54,509
I don't see why not, but we haven't tried it.

637
01:00:54,509 --> 01:00:55,489
CARTA wants to say something.

638
01:00:57,198 --> 01:01:01,860
Yeah, very short, the system is listening to the user.

639
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:07,341
So whatever the user is giving to the system, the system will say, this is the perfect thing

640
01:01:07,341 --> 01:01:08,741
to work with.

641
01:01:08,741 --> 01:01:12,862
But the artificial intelligence is used in that way.

642
01:01:12,862 --> 01:01:18,543
It will use the material you put in and continue to compose with it.

643
01:01:19,304 --> 01:01:25,868
For the memory, for the learning, we are using kind of a library, which is a memory.

644
01:01:25,868 --> 01:01:30,672
And the system can save it and call back these memories.

645
01:01:30,672 --> 01:01:37,957
And this is mainly for the composers to create the personal style with the library, as we

646
01:01:37,957 --> 01:01:41,760
all have somewhere in our minds.

647
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,842
And yeah, this is...

648
01:01:45,419 --> 01:01:51,683
The functions in the system can actually, if we put it on and let it compose, it can

649
01:01:51,683 --> 01:01:54,045
continue forever.

650
01:01:54,045 --> 01:01:59,328
It can select from the library by itself, but also the composers can come in and change

651
01:01:59,328 --> 01:02:00,329
it in real time if needed.

652
01:02:00,329 --> 01:02:01,430
Okay, thank you.

653
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:02,731
So thank you all very much for coming.

654
01:02:02,731 --> 01:02:03,391
It's great to see you here.

655
01:02:03,391 --> 01:02:03,731
Thank you.
