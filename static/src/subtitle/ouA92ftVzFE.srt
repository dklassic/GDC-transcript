1
00:00:07,297 --> 00:00:09,880
Good morning, everyone. My name is Brian Francis.

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,323
I'm a community manager with GDC and a contributing editor at gamasutra.com.

3
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:18,447
If you need to refer to me in the third person, my pronouns are he, him.

4
00:00:18,907 --> 00:00:21,670
I am joined today by Shell Games VP of Game Design,

5
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,112
Harley Baldwin and speedrunner Utsu.

6
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:27,155
Harley and Utsu, would you please introduce yourselves?

7
00:00:28,456 --> 00:00:29,737
Hi, I'm Harley Baldwin.

8
00:00:29,817 --> 00:00:32,679
As you said, I'm the VP of Design at Shell Games.

9
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,321
And many years ago.

10
00:00:36,142 --> 00:00:41,625
16 years ago. I was a senior level designer at LucasArts and had the great good fortune

11
00:00:41,725 --> 00:00:50,090
to work on Republic Commando. I haven't ever seen anybody speed run it and so this is going to be

12
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,712
fascinating experience for me and I can't wait.

13
00:00:56,774 --> 00:01:00,896
My name is Utsu. I'm the speed runner.

14
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:06,883
I picked up this game a few months ago just because I always enjoyed

15
00:01:07,823 --> 00:01:12,646
Robocommando as a game and as I looked in the run it looked more

16
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:16,388
and more interesting especially since a newer bug got found a little while ago.

17
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:23,011
And so I basically picked it up and

18
00:01:23,331 --> 00:01:26,813
it's been fun to run ever since and if you need to

19
00:01:26,993 --> 00:01:30,075
refer to me in the third person my pronouns are she her.

20
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:37,655
Roger that, thank you Utsu. So for folks who've been watching our last couple speedruns,

21
00:01:38,536 --> 00:01:42,439
I mentioned the last couple days that speedrunning is this incredible art form that sort of brings the

22
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,962
the play and video game closer to the development of video games.

23
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:50,624
Today we are, obviously as people mentioned, we're running Star Wars

24
00:01:50,664 --> 00:01:55,626
Republic Commando, a LucasArts game from 2005. Republic Commando is one of my

25
00:01:55,687 --> 00:01:59,769
favorite shooters from my teenage years. It's a Star Wars game without Jedi.

26
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:03,571
Its cultural relevance is still felt today as its heroes Delta Squadron were

27
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:05,772
featured in Star Wars Clone Wars, the TV show.

28
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:09,474
Karen Travis's books kept Love for the Clone Commandos alive and

29
00:02:09,774 --> 00:02:11,875
sort of brought built out the commando.

30
00:02:12,543 --> 00:02:14,644
group in the popular eye for a number of years.

31
00:02:15,265 --> 00:02:18,266
And just this year, Lucasfilm announced another upcoming

32
00:02:18,286 --> 00:02:20,647
series about clone soldiers, Star Wars The Bad Batch.

33
00:02:21,527 --> 00:02:24,529
While Republic Commando isn't the only reason that fans have

34
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:27,370
fallen in love with the clones and the different nicknames

35
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,991
they give themselves and the roles they occupy in Star Wars,

36
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:32,752
it's definitely a big reason for it.

37
00:02:33,092 --> 00:02:33,753
It's why we're here.

38
00:02:33,813 --> 00:02:35,493
It gave birth to Karen Travis's books.

39
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:46,343
From a game side, Republic Commando captures a particular moment in game design that's a halfway mark between classic shooters like Doom and modern shooters like Fortnite, Call of Duty, or Apex Legends.

40
00:02:46,824 --> 00:02:53,570
And we're lucky to be joined by Harley, who, as she mentioned, she was a senior level designer on the game, to talk about what it was like making games in that era.

41
00:02:53,911 --> 00:02:59,837
Also, we are here because there are some particular ways that Utsu will be breaking this game that I really want to see how she reacts to.

42
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:09,325
With that in mind, really quick I'm gonna look at chat. We have folks like Taylor D, Alex Jacobson,

43
00:03:09,345 --> 00:03:14,010
Heath Close, thank you all for joining us. Ryan Lippert wants to say this is one of the most

44
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,673
overlooked and underrated Star Wars games. This was a huge part of their middle school gaming days,

45
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:22,758
mine too. Folks in chat, if you have questions for Harley or Utsu, if you're a...

46
00:03:23,901 --> 00:03:25,305
And we're gonna ask to keep it on topic.

47
00:03:25,345 --> 00:03:27,551
I know we've got some runner fans in here

48
00:03:27,591 --> 00:03:28,735
and I appreciate having you here,

49
00:03:28,795 --> 00:03:31,102
but we're Game Developers Conference, we gotta keep it.

50
00:03:31,704 --> 00:03:35,386
game development. If you have questions for Harley about working on this game, feel free to ask him.

51
00:03:35,406 --> 00:03:40,670
If you're a developer and want to know about speedrunners and speedrunning games, feel free

52
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:49,575
to ask them for Utsu and I will grab them. With that, I think it's time. I believe the battle in

53
00:03:49,795 --> 00:03:54,398
the Geonosis Arena has kicked off. The war has begun. Utsu, take it away.

54
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:56,660
And you want me to start from new game?

55
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,040
Start from new game, please.

56
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,901
All right.

57
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:00,722
Oh, I've got chills.

58
00:04:12,758 --> 00:04:18,643
I was just rewatching Clone Wars and Tan Wei was in a bunch of episodes that I featured

59
00:04:18,683 --> 00:04:18,763
in.

60
00:04:18,843 --> 00:04:22,906
I love the design of these creatures, you know, they're influenced by the Greys.

61
00:04:24,187 --> 00:04:29,310
Episode 2 does a great job with like 50s sci-fi aesthetic and importing it for a new world.

62
00:04:30,977 --> 00:04:45,941
Yeah, this whole sequence was basically done by animation and technical art when we realized

63
00:04:45,981 --> 00:04:52,563
like, oh yeah, we need a little bit of a tutorial just about how to use the twin stick shooters.

64
00:04:55,444 --> 00:04:59,826
And they got together and essentially skunkworst this.

65
00:05:01,547 --> 00:05:04,349
uh, to a pretty, pretty final level of done.

66
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:08,913
Um, it was, it was really amazing when we came in.

67
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,835
Oh, look, this is basically already been handled.

68
00:05:12,235 --> 00:05:12,575
Yeah.

69
00:05:13,036 --> 00:05:16,058
It's yeah, it's kind of not a level, but it is like a brief, like, you

70
00:05:16,098 --> 00:05:17,619
know, it's in the narrative space.

71
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:19,100
It's not a, it's not a cut scene.

72
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,262
Cause it's not pre-rendered and it's not a, um, level of just

73
00:05:22,302 --> 00:05:23,443
the player doesn't move during it.

74
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:28,413
Although there is a brief, like, yeah, this part, the tutorial.

75
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:29,534
Like, this is really neat.

76
00:05:31,256 --> 00:05:33,098
I actually personally referenced this.

77
00:05:33,718 --> 00:05:36,501
I was running a Star Wars, we were running a Clone Wars RPG session

78
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:40,624
using Fantasy Flight Games RPG system, and we had a bunch of new players

79
00:05:40,644 --> 00:05:42,206
who'd never played with the system before, so I was like,

80
00:05:42,846 --> 00:05:45,068
right, Clone Wars handled, Republic Commando handled this.

81
00:05:45,488 --> 00:05:47,450
We'll just pretend we're on Kamino doing a training session.

82
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,691
Yeah.

83
00:05:48,711 --> 00:05:48,911
Yeah.

84
00:05:50,923 --> 00:05:54,106
Real quick, let's go to chat and start taking some questions.

85
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,668
Here's one from Big Law Big Law for Harley.

86
00:05:56,748 --> 00:06:00,211
What's the most interesting hitch you had developing this game?

87
00:06:01,712 --> 00:06:05,735
I think the most interesting one that we had as a team overall

88
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:10,479
was that originally the commandos were indistinguishable from one another.

89
00:06:10,499 --> 00:06:12,301
They were clones, right? We figured they were clones.

90
00:06:13,002 --> 00:06:17,345
And we were working in the context of the movie.

91
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:25,100
in which clones are clones are clones and so we had all four of them using essentially the same

92
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:33,904
voice or voice of lights and it became clear that that was difficult to know who was doing what,

93
00:06:33,944 --> 00:06:39,887
there were gameplay implications that were a problem and when we showed it to George Lucas

94
00:06:40,207 --> 00:06:42,588
he felt that it would be a stronger story if

95
00:06:43,651 --> 00:06:48,835
the clones were differentiated and lent his support behind the idea of giving each clone

96
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:53,780
a personality. That stuff actually came in pretty late and it was only through the amazing

97
00:06:53,820 --> 00:07:02,407
gargantuan efforts of the writers, the artists, etc. that we actually managed to get the four

98
00:07:02,747 --> 00:07:12,155
distinct commandos in and to give them personalities and just everybody. It was an amazing...

99
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:19,613
new feature and new conceptual feature that sort of came in without a hitch, but if I

100
00:07:19,653 --> 00:07:26,277
was on a game where that level of change came in at the late date that it did now, with

101
00:07:26,317 --> 00:07:31,901
the experience that I have, I never would have tried to pull something like that off.

102
00:07:32,741 --> 00:07:37,504
Could I, not to interrupt, but if I ask a quick question, is there a way that I can

103
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:39,806
mute the Zoom audio feed?

104
00:07:41,907 --> 00:07:43,528
That's a good question.

105
00:07:43,548 --> 00:07:49,571
Because I'm hearing the game twice and it's a little distracting.

106
00:07:49,591 --> 00:07:57,957
If our tech team, is there a way to mute that through Zoom?

107
00:07:58,957 --> 00:08:08,463
While we go ahead with the run, while this cuts in still modes, let's see here.

108
00:08:08,483 --> 00:08:10,885
It sounds like we just killed the audio, that's fine, we'll be okay.

109
00:08:12,531 --> 00:08:16,533
Uh, Utsu, what's your favorite level to run in this, to do in this run?

110
00:08:16,553 --> 00:08:20,755
Uh, like individual or like section?

111
00:08:20,895 --> 00:08:25,657
We'll go ahead for the sections because there's only three levels if you look at it at the top level.

112
00:08:25,677 --> 00:08:26,537
All right.

113
00:08:27,517 --> 00:08:30,819
Um, my favorite one is the Republic Assault Ship.

114
00:08:31,179 --> 00:08:35,841
Um, my very favorite is the part, is the...

115
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:44,720
First, technically second hangar that you clear in the Republic Assault Ship.

116
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:49,381
The one where you have to like set up for the incoming droid dispensers.

117
00:08:49,401 --> 00:08:49,681
Yep.

118
00:08:50,241 --> 00:08:55,282
Alright, with the run beginning, let's go ahead and watch our first hack take place.

119
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:58,523
Just a little jump over the wall, which I think actually might be allowed,

120
00:08:58,543 --> 00:09:01,144
but then Uchi's about to do something that when we were testing this,

121
00:09:01,184 --> 00:09:04,044
was already just like, oh no, that's not how you play this game.

122
00:09:05,084 --> 00:09:05,425
There we go.

123
00:09:06,734 --> 00:09:09,756
Little behind the geometry there, nice.

124
00:09:10,036 --> 00:09:12,537
We, I have a fun fact about this level.

125
00:09:12,877 --> 00:09:14,278
The goal for the first part of this mission

126
00:09:14,338 --> 00:09:16,619
is to hunt the Geonosian General Sunfack.

127
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,102
Sunfack has actually been, he's still kicking around.

128
00:09:21,342 --> 00:09:24,684
I play the Fantasy Flight Games tabletop game,

129
00:09:24,824 --> 00:09:27,005
X-Wing Miniatures, and now that they've introduced

130
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:27,946
the prequel factions.

131
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:32,544
They've released the Geonosian Starfighter and Sun Fac is the most powerful.

132
00:09:32,564 --> 00:09:37,627
He gets to be a character in that game because he's just riding around in the Geonosian Starfighter.

133
00:09:37,867 --> 00:09:41,629
Also, he sucks. He's such a pain to deal with when other players use him.

134
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:47,651
So, something you probably just saw me do there is you probably saw the load bar go twice.

135
00:09:47,752 --> 00:09:53,154
It's because I quicksave and I quickloaded during the load screen.

136
00:09:53,174 --> 00:09:53,834
Which, doing that...

137
00:09:58,085 --> 00:10:06,632
From what I understand is the level triggers spawn after your character spawns, and if

138
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:11,636
you quicksave and quickload before the character spawns, it messes up the triggers.

139
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:18,261
So here I can tell 6-2 to hack this console before I'm even told to hack it.

140
00:10:19,282 --> 00:10:21,403
Thanks!

141
00:10:21,824 --> 00:10:23,845
I didn't even notice that when I was watching this one before.

142
00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:32,623
Harley, I noticed watching this run, you know, a lot of interactions are slowed down by the

143
00:10:32,663 --> 00:10:39,350
force timers on using, you know, interacting with doors or ordering the clones to interact

144
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:39,830
with doors.

145
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:42,613
Were those sort of meant to pad out the game a little bit?

146
00:10:42,653 --> 00:10:45,535
They do, like sometimes it's very clear that they're meant to make things feel tense.

147
00:10:47,057 --> 00:10:49,319
But I'm curious what some of the philosophy behind that was.

148
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:49,419
So.

149
00:10:52,229 --> 00:11:01,632
Partly it was because we knew there would be places where you might have, you know, a threat on this side of the door that you have to deal with, you're trying to get through on the other side.

150
00:11:01,652 --> 00:11:13,216
I don't think there was really any desire to pad out the game so much as there was to give level designers tools to create that feeling of tension, right?

151
00:11:14,097 --> 00:11:18,958
We discovered early on that if you don't really have to depend on your squad...

152
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:22,260
then you'll just leave them behind, you won't pay attention,

153
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,881
and it's not gonna feel like a squad game.

154
00:11:24,441 --> 00:11:25,042
Okay, and now?

155
00:11:25,082 --> 00:11:25,582
Since that was-

156
00:11:25,862 --> 00:11:27,002
Like, yeah, like-

157
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:28,143
Yeah, like you are now.

158
00:11:29,323 --> 00:11:32,545
And I suspect that there's gonna be a lot of that

159
00:11:32,665 --> 00:11:33,485
in this playthrough.

160
00:11:34,706 --> 00:11:36,547
It was really, it was a pillar of the game

161
00:11:36,627 --> 00:11:38,828
to try to do that, so.

162
00:11:39,268 --> 00:11:41,909
I also noticed, though, you don't need your squad

163
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:43,590
because you're skipping a lot of triggers

164
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,731
and that kind of stuff, so you've got a lot of AI

165
00:11:46,771 --> 00:11:49,232
just standing there, waiting to be told it should wake up.

166
00:11:50,656 --> 00:11:52,878
Again, a thing I think I'm going to see a lot of today.

167
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:55,081
So this is going to be the most confusing part.

168
00:11:55,141 --> 00:11:57,183
So first, I quicksave and quickloaded here.

169
00:11:57,543 --> 00:12:00,006
And then if you press the walk button, the shift button,

170
00:12:00,046 --> 00:12:03,089
while you go down a zip line, you don't go down the zip line.

171
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,992
So I get to just be up here, which lets me do this.

172
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:07,694
Oh, no.

173
00:12:08,114 --> 00:12:09,296
Which lets me walk by the glass.

174
00:12:10,455 --> 00:12:14,980
Nice, because there's no collision up there to keep you to do it, because nobody would ever be up there.

175
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,001
Yeah.

176
00:12:16,221 --> 00:12:20,385
Usually, once you shoot the glass, you gotta go through this whole cutscene where you open up that door and then

177
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:24,508
O7 has to shoot down a thing. But because I quicksave and quickloaded,

178
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:30,394
I can just come over here to the exit door and leave.

179
00:12:31,915 --> 00:12:35,058
So I quicksave with a mouse button during this, uh...

180
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,311
I have to do with a mouse button during these,

181
00:12:38,471 --> 00:12:42,033
or I have to somehow press start before it fully

182
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:42,913
loads to quick save.

183
00:12:43,694 --> 00:12:45,354
And doing that lets me quick load.

184
00:12:46,955 --> 00:12:48,316
And I can walk around in this cut scene.

185
00:12:49,616 --> 00:12:52,437
Oh my goodness.

186
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:55,499
I do love getting to look at these armors from this angle

187
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,139
in this cut scene.

188
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:59,220
You can really get to see how the, I love like the hologram,

189
00:12:59,261 --> 00:13:01,682
you know, like the, like all the ways that like,

190
00:13:02,222 --> 00:13:03,843
it gathers and orients people in the scene,

191
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,603
you know, like everyone gathering around waiting for orders.

192
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:12,829
We were talking before about how the personalities for 07, 40, and 62 got added late in the game.

193
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:19,673
I've heard Brett DeVille, a friend of the show, who helped make this happen, shout out

194
00:13:19,693 --> 00:13:20,433
to our guy.

195
00:13:21,574 --> 00:13:25,436
I've heard him talk before about how that's sort of the reason that even though each clone

196
00:13:25,476 --> 00:13:29,919
has a specialty, those specialties aren't really reflected in the gameplay.

197
00:13:29,979 --> 00:13:32,580
I play like Seb, if I have my rules remembering right.

198
00:13:33,694 --> 00:13:36,575
Sev isn't really any better at sniping than any of the other clones.

199
00:13:38,096 --> 00:13:40,817
That sort of sounds like it came from the same place, right?

200
00:13:40,857 --> 00:13:41,897
That late arrival?

201
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:48,120
Well, it did, and it also, like, we did do some experience trying to figure out if we

202
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,101
tuned them differently, would it make a difference?

203
00:13:50,501 --> 00:13:55,183
What we found was that there was so much cognitive load trying to figure out who to put on what.

204
00:13:56,027 --> 00:13:58,888
that it actually frustrated players.

205
00:13:59,508 --> 00:14:05,069
And so we went with conceptually, you know who you want to use things, and players who

206
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:08,670
want to opt into that can, and players who don't, won't.

207
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:12,211
We didn't publicize that there wasn't any difference, obviously.

208
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:15,692
In fact, it wasn't really well known or widely known until pretty late.

209
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:23,394
It was still, like I had people walk up to me for years telling me, you know, I really

210
00:14:23,454 --> 00:14:25,956
like using Sev on the sniper positions, etc.

211
00:14:26,876 --> 00:14:29,638
Because your brain just convinces you that that's the way it is.

212
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:37,364
That is certainly not unique to Republic Commando, the idea that you can let the player's expectations

213
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:42,227
fill in features that might otherwise be actually problematic to implement.

214
00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:47,667
Yeah, Gabe Paftr in chat wants to say that I,

215
00:14:47,747 --> 00:14:49,487
Brett DeVille's oral history stream is great.

216
00:14:49,527 --> 00:14:50,267
Highly recommended.

217
00:14:51,148 --> 00:14:52,848
Also, yeah, I watched that stream too.

218
00:14:52,948 --> 00:14:55,289
And I picked up a few facts that are in my note sheet

219
00:14:55,309 --> 00:14:58,610
from it, because he was nice enough to grab some guests

220
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,110
from, he grabbed some of his former coworkers.

221
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,491
I don't remember how they view on it,

222
00:15:03,391 --> 00:15:04,051
but that was a lot of fun.

223
00:15:04,091 --> 00:15:05,031
I think that was like back in 14 or 15,

224
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:07,232
because I remember watching it in my old job.

225
00:15:08,411 --> 00:15:14,873
I wasn't on that, I was on the most recent, he and Tim Longo did a Dev Game Club podcast

226
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:20,014
very recently where they played this game and interviewed a bunch of the people who

227
00:15:20,034 --> 00:15:22,695
were developers on it, and I did get to be on that one, it was great.

228
00:15:24,355 --> 00:15:26,796
I highly recommend it if you're interested in the game generally.

229
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:33,097
Yeah, Mariana McQueen wants to say that they love these skips, and so do I Mariana.

230
00:15:33,858 --> 00:15:38,561
Um, uh, Heath Close would like to know, was there a significance behind the names 0740162?

231
00:15:39,281 --> 00:15:48,686
Uh, not that I know of, definitely 38 though. Um, oh yeah, there's a, there's a tradition at LucasArts,

232
00:15:48,766 --> 00:15:53,809
well there was a tradition when LucasArts existed, of naming characters and rooms and

233
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:57,511
things and robots and whatever you could after, um, THX 1138, which was...

234
00:16:00,731 --> 00:16:03,533
an early and seminal movie for George Lucas,

235
00:16:03,673 --> 00:16:06,755
in which a lot of the techniques that he used

236
00:16:06,815 --> 00:16:08,376
to create the Star Wars franchise

237
00:16:08,456 --> 00:16:10,457
generally were explored early.

238
00:16:12,278 --> 00:16:17,022
And we all had, I think, a deep fondness for the movie,

239
00:16:17,062 --> 00:16:19,463
so reflected it as much as we could.

240
00:16:20,502 --> 00:16:22,383
By the way, if you're a person who loves Star Wars,

241
00:16:22,403 --> 00:16:25,243
but hasn't checked out George Lucas's film American Graffiti,

242
00:16:25,283 --> 00:16:28,384
I finally watched that late last year and I was blown away.

243
00:16:28,984 --> 00:16:31,745
God, like what a and it's funny because there's a there's a one.

244
00:16:31,765 --> 00:16:33,765
There's an 1138 reference in that movie, too.

245
00:16:34,886 --> 00:16:38,607
And I'm so a you get to see Harrison Ford, you know, right before Han Solo

246
00:16:39,107 --> 00:16:43,068
and be such a wonderful movie, like such a straight like

247
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:44,568
it couldn't get made today.

248
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:46,348
This is what I felt watching it.

249
00:16:46,388 --> 00:16:47,789
And it was so wonderful to watch.

250
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:48,609
Oh.

251
00:16:49,893 --> 00:16:59,822
Gabe has another good question. Does the AI have a preference if they point us at a snipe point and all the squadmates are available, does the game default to Sev over others?

252
00:17:01,543 --> 00:17:13,453
I don't think so, but it's possible. I mean, the AI programmer who worked on this, John Hintock, he spent the entire...

253
00:17:14,397 --> 00:17:19,479
development cycle of the game working on it. And that could be in there, and I honestly wouldn't

254
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:26,943
know. The level of craftsmanship that he put into the squad AI was truly mind-boggling.

255
00:17:27,283 --> 00:17:31,805
And it's certainly possible. It's also possible that you just think so, because your mind's doing

256
00:17:31,845 --> 00:17:35,046
confirmation bias every time you see Sev walk up to a snake point, right?

257
00:17:35,486 --> 00:17:37,467
Yeah, you only remember those times, not the other ones.

258
00:17:37,547 --> 00:17:37,687
Yeah.

259
00:17:41,999 --> 00:17:45,679
The load-save hack, or the quick-save hack, is really interesting.

260
00:17:45,879 --> 00:17:48,620
I mean, it's certainly standard practice in game development

261
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:55,682
to figure out what you think your most airtight level load and save scripts are.

262
00:17:56,162 --> 00:17:59,082
And once you've got that, you replicate it all over the game, right?

263
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,043
So if somebody finds a way to hack that,

264
00:18:01,063 --> 00:18:03,343
they've essentially got a backdoor into the entire game,

265
00:18:03,363 --> 00:18:04,684
which is what you're using right now.

266
00:18:06,264 --> 00:18:08,665
Something that I wanted to say back there is that if you didn't see it,

267
00:18:09,743 --> 00:18:12,185
So following props, if you quick save and quick load,

268
00:18:13,206 --> 00:18:16,208
will just be frozen in air where they

269
00:18:17,209 --> 00:18:18,931
where they were, the quick save happened

270
00:18:20,192 --> 00:18:21,853
until they're interacted with again.

271
00:18:22,514 --> 00:18:25,776
So that let me skip to a bomb planting portions.

272
00:18:26,157 --> 00:18:29,660
What that also did is it displaced this this bridge here.

273
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,322
Oh, no. Oh, so.

274
00:18:32,562 --> 00:18:36,285
So if I try to go the correct way, the intended, like walk through this way.

275
00:18:36,305 --> 00:18:38,767
Oh. Yeah.

276
00:18:39,215 --> 00:18:40,696
So to get past that, you have to do this.

277
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:46,941
Excepted. Oh my goodness.

278
00:18:47,021 --> 00:18:48,302
Go where the bridge was.

279
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:50,683
Oh, fascinating.

280
00:18:50,703 --> 00:18:50,763
Yep.

281
00:18:51,184 --> 00:18:55,546
Right, and that would have been

282
00:18:55,566 --> 00:18:56,287
that would have been

283
00:18:56,367 --> 00:18:59,049
an optimization of physics

284
00:18:59,149 --> 00:19:00,730
because back in those days,

285
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,052
having any kind of physics simulation

286
00:19:03,092 --> 00:19:04,773
in your game was incredibly expensive.

287
00:19:05,433 --> 00:19:05,573
And...

288
00:19:06,025 --> 00:19:11,448
So we had to find ways to turn it off as soon as we possibly could, you know, if the player's not looking at it, etc.

289
00:19:11,468 --> 00:19:19,751
Uh, from chat, uh, Big Law Big Law says that's goofy as heck. I agree.

290
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,512
Harley, I have a question for you while we roll ahead.

291
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:30,516
Utu, feel free to just interrupt us if you have a great hack or skip to show off.

292
00:19:31,477 --> 00:19:37,843
What other games from the time of development were you sort of inspired by as a level designer?

293
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:43,247
Oh, well, I mean, you always start with Half-Life, right?

294
00:19:45,069 --> 00:19:45,890
But everybody does.

295
00:19:47,763 --> 00:19:55,130
Uh, we were definitely looking at, uh, at early, uh, multiplayer squad games.

296
00:19:56,051 --> 00:20:06,761
Um, uh, definitely looking at, um, at other, uh, uh, sorry, I'm the, the

297
00:20:06,801 --> 00:20:10,244
repeat of that makes me feel like I'm in the, in the matrix, uh,

298
00:20:10,725 --> 00:20:12,466
and kind of hijacks my brain.

299
00:20:12,847 --> 00:20:13,687
Um, uh.

300
00:20:14,986 --> 00:20:20,892
this hard. I struggle with this so much and I don't know why. So what I'm doing here is,

301
00:20:22,193 --> 00:20:28,058
you can climb through this window but I can't remember the, I can get this, but I just can't

302
00:20:28,098 --> 00:20:34,164
remember the correct angle to go at it. It's a little hole in the in the collision somewhere

303
00:20:34,184 --> 00:20:36,366
that you can just hit. Yeah, I got a

304
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:43,100
This is something we discussed in one of our earlier runs,

305
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,481
is how sometimes these hacks,

306
00:20:44,501 --> 00:20:46,863
because you're burning so much time elsewhere,

307
00:20:46,883 --> 00:20:49,866
it's okay to run these hacks over and over again.

308
00:20:49,926 --> 00:20:50,686
Right, right.

309
00:20:51,267 --> 00:20:53,909
Yeah, this one I can't really afford to just not do either,

310
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:55,270
because it saves so much time.

311
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:55,370
Yeah.

312
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,434
You just tap that to...

313
00:20:59,834 --> 00:21:01,535
I should have access to unlock doors

314
00:21:01,596 --> 00:21:02,716
once a link is established.

315
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:05,619
It's so interesting.

316
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:07,480
The way that you play this game

317
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:16,245
is not at all about trying to create a sort of coherent narrative, and I don't mean the story

318
00:21:16,265 --> 00:21:23,470
of the game, I mean the narrative of what you're doing as the player, as the character. It's really

319
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:34,598
about creating a narrative of how the game was built and how you have sort of packed insight

320
00:21:34,858 --> 00:21:36,299
into the way the game was built.

321
00:21:40,827 --> 00:21:44,671
I feel like watching speedrunning is a thing that people who want to get into game development

322
00:21:44,711 --> 00:21:50,316
should do because it just shows you so many of the secrets of how we do this stuff.

323
00:21:51,156 --> 00:21:57,021
Yeah, Harley, you didn't work on Junos specifically, we're going to see your own Minecraft levels

324
00:21:57,061 --> 00:22:01,966
when we get to Kashyyyk, but you were helping other designers work on these early levels.

325
00:22:01,986 --> 00:22:05,008
Do you have any memories about, obviously not about...

326
00:22:05,712 --> 00:22:07,733
Obviously not about trying to make sure players didn't do this,

327
00:22:08,053 --> 00:22:11,313
but do you have any memories of helping your teammates figure out

328
00:22:11,353 --> 00:22:13,074
what this game should feel like in its early stages?

329
00:22:15,714 --> 00:22:16,775
We did have a really...

330
00:22:18,475 --> 00:22:20,275
We spent a lot of time on the bridge,

331
00:22:20,695 --> 00:22:22,476
the falling bridge that you skipped earlier,

332
00:22:23,376 --> 00:22:26,577
because it was so much about establishing place,

333
00:22:26,697 --> 00:22:27,817
establishing enemy,

334
00:22:29,297 --> 00:22:32,258
establishing how useful sniping could be.

335
00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:33,678
You know, there's a...

336
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:39,376
sort of half tutorial half cut scene early on with the bridge where you're supposed to

337
00:22:39,696 --> 00:22:47,587
snipe a geonosian um and um uh just restarting the whole level just in case that's good yeah

338
00:22:47,607 --> 00:22:50,330
that's fine because we were learning so much about

339
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:54,109
establishing place and character of a level.

340
00:22:54,129 --> 00:22:57,391
We spent a lot of time as a level design group

341
00:22:57,691 --> 00:23:01,894
looking at that and discussing it and playing it and giving feedback

342
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:04,576
and seeing new iterations and stuff like that.

343
00:23:04,596 --> 00:23:09,859
It was a very early level to come forward, you know.

344
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:14,882
The way that essentially the development on this game worked was that

345
00:23:17,165 --> 00:23:20,807
One level would be running out ahead, trying new things,

346
00:23:21,668 --> 00:23:22,568
trying to meet new goals,

347
00:23:22,588 --> 00:23:25,690
whether those were technical or experiential or whatever,

348
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,931
sometimes tools, to make sure that that would work

349
00:23:28,971 --> 00:23:31,153
for other people so that everybody didn't get stopped

350
00:23:31,253 --> 00:23:35,155
by a, oh, nope, that's not gonna work moment later on,

351
00:23:35,575 --> 00:23:36,976
that you'd already had time to work that out.

352
00:23:37,036 --> 00:23:39,057
And so this was one of those levels, right?

353
00:23:39,737 --> 00:23:42,238
We also knew that because it was the very beginning

354
00:23:42,278 --> 00:23:45,640
of the game, we were going to need to be able to,

355
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:50,454
build it, then build the whole game, then come back and make sure that it was supporting

356
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:57,039
what it needed to support, both in terms of tutorial and story, narrative context.

357
00:23:57,139 --> 00:24:03,343
So it got a lot of that stuff.

358
00:24:03,423 --> 00:24:04,163
Taylor?

359
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:14,430
Also, I think one of my follow notifications went through my OBS.

360
00:24:15,864 --> 00:24:16,384
Oh, interesting.

361
00:24:18,225 --> 00:24:21,366
Really quick, Taylor D. first wants to say you got this, Itsu.

362
00:24:21,386 --> 00:24:23,027
So you got some support.

363
00:24:23,307 --> 00:24:25,928
Taylor would also like to add in from a longtime speed runner.

364
00:24:26,288 --> 00:24:28,789
Watching speed running has to be done with the proper mindset.

365
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:33,091
If you're a game dev, we often like not having these types of tricks patched out.

366
00:24:33,191 --> 00:24:38,473
And in their experience, devs will often use runners as free QA, which isn't fun.

367
00:24:38,513 --> 00:24:40,134
Both of the other developers we talked to this week

368
00:24:40,154 --> 00:24:43,275
definitely acknowledge that, like, you know, they see a bug

369
00:24:43,335 --> 00:24:44,695
that shows up and runs and they do their.

370
00:24:44,981 --> 00:24:47,042
they actually go out of their way not to patch those out

371
00:24:47,062 --> 00:24:50,384
because it doesn't interrupt the main player's experience.

372
00:24:51,785 --> 00:24:55,206
And they definitely did that,

373
00:24:55,226 --> 00:24:58,508
but I also could see some dev watching GDQ or whatever

374
00:24:58,528 --> 00:25:01,010
and being like, oh no, we have to eliminate that bug

375
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,991
for some reason they feel is valid.

376
00:25:03,311 --> 00:25:05,012
But I understand where Taylor's coming from.

377
00:25:05,732 --> 00:25:07,373
Yeah, yeah.

378
00:25:08,554 --> 00:25:10,955
It's interesting what I have taken away from

379
00:25:12,268 --> 00:25:14,830
from things like this is, well, okay,

380
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,111
so sometimes a buck comes up

381
00:25:16,251 --> 00:25:17,693
and it's in the player's favor, right?

382
00:25:18,613 --> 00:25:19,554
But it's going to be rare

383
00:25:19,634 --> 00:25:21,216
on some kind of a vanilla playthrough.

384
00:25:21,476 --> 00:25:21,856
For me.

385
00:25:22,484 --> 00:25:26,707
Like, I mark those will not fix, and I do it with a kind of a joy, because I know that

386
00:25:26,727 --> 00:25:31,172
a curious player might find that, and it's not going to break anything else that they're

387
00:25:31,232 --> 00:25:35,676
not interested in having broken, and they get to walk away feeling like they've outsmarted

388
00:25:35,696 --> 00:25:36,176
the developers.

389
00:25:36,477 --> 00:25:41,061
That being said, I absolutely am not claiming that we find all the bugs and decide not to

390
00:25:41,101 --> 00:25:41,862
fix them.

391
00:25:42,422 --> 00:25:45,685
Certainly, speedrunners find bugs that we haven't found.

392
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:50,273
It's also true that probably every game you speedrun has a few of those little

393
00:25:50,694 --> 00:25:57,479
love letters to curiosity, sort of, in the game. It is our job to make things that people enjoy.

394
00:25:57,499 --> 00:26:07,307
And it is also our job to keep a wide variety of player types in mind, right? Yeah, you can make

395
00:26:07,367 --> 00:26:12,932
some games for a very narrow player type. Only people who, whatever, like to collect everything

396
00:26:12,952 --> 00:26:13,312
or whatever.

397
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:18,373
There are situations in which that can happen, but especially when you're talking about AAA

398
00:26:18,393 --> 00:26:25,178
games, you have to appeal to a wide variety of player types because you need those sales.

399
00:26:26,139 --> 00:26:33,484
So I always look at bugs like that and say, like, do we have to fix this if people who

400
00:26:33,564 --> 00:26:38,627
are sort of just playing through without looking for stuff like this won't find it or be bothered

401
00:26:38,668 --> 00:26:43,351
by it, but people who really, really value it might find it and have a great time with

402
00:26:43,391 --> 00:26:43,431
it?

403
00:26:43,898 --> 00:26:49,502
Utsu, I'm not asking this from a hurry-to perspective, but I just want to know, would it help you if it was okay if we skipped ahead?

404
00:26:49,822 --> 00:26:57,147
Like, as much as I want to see this hack, I also don't want you to feel bad if you pick someone to do it.

405
00:26:57,728 --> 00:27:01,510
See, the issue is I don't know if I can just skip it.

406
00:27:02,775 --> 00:27:05,656
Oh wait, yeah, I can. Let me give it like five more tries.

407
00:27:05,696 --> 00:27:08,658
This isn't that hard. I have literally no idea why it's this difficult.

408
00:27:08,678 --> 00:27:10,039
It's just not cooperating with me.

409
00:27:10,459 --> 00:27:14,301
Yeah, hey, look, in these uncertain times,

410
00:27:14,561 --> 00:27:17,823
we just sort of have to roll with the punches, yeah.

411
00:27:18,043 --> 00:27:20,565
As I've said 20 times this season.

412
00:27:20,645 --> 00:27:24,527
It's entirely possible that I'm the one who put the bad geometry here.

413
00:27:24,587 --> 00:27:27,048
You know, at the end of any dev cycle,

414
00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:29,750
once you've done all of the creative stuff...

415
00:27:30,684 --> 00:27:34,445
A level designer spends a lot of time just going and trying to put in geometry to keep

416
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,706
people from doing stuff like this.

417
00:27:35,766 --> 00:27:45,349
And if you're a tiny bit slapdash or your verts aren't snapped or whatever, it leaves

418
00:27:45,389 --> 00:27:45,669
a hole.

419
00:27:46,389 --> 00:27:47,330
Yeah.

420
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:51,571
Gabe would like to know again, did the team explore multiplayer with AI squads like in

421
00:27:51,611 --> 00:27:52,231
single player?

422
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:53,232
If not, why?

423
00:27:54,252 --> 00:27:55,012
If so, why?

424
00:27:56,193 --> 00:27:57,133
If not, why not?

425
00:27:57,253 --> 00:27:59,094
Or if so, why didn't it make it into the game?

426
00:27:59,894 --> 00:28:00,034
Yeah.

427
00:28:00,703 --> 00:28:03,744
We didn't, and the answer is actually really simple.

428
00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:07,526
With the hardware that we were running at the time,

429
00:28:07,846 --> 00:28:10,908
both the PCs that people had in the home

430
00:28:10,928 --> 00:28:13,829
and the original Xbox this game released on,

431
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:18,131
there wouldn't have been a way to make

432
00:28:18,151 --> 00:28:20,232
a decent-looking multiplayer arenas

433
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,413
and still optimize enough

434
00:28:22,954 --> 00:28:24,855
to have all of those characters in the game.

435
00:28:25,575 --> 00:28:26,515
Oh no, oh no.

436
00:28:26,595 --> 00:28:27,836
Yeah, and so-

437
00:28:27,856 --> 00:28:28,696
You just fell through a lot.

438
00:28:31,357 --> 00:28:38,362
I just did the bug where you stop a zipline and that whole ship isn't solid so I can just jump through it.

439
00:28:38,382 --> 00:28:39,743
Nice.

440
00:28:39,983 --> 00:28:41,064
That's faster than I thought.

441
00:28:41,144 --> 00:28:43,946
Sometimes when you watch it you're just like, oh no.

442
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:45,607
Like, oh no, my brain.

443
00:28:47,249 --> 00:28:50,851
I just progressed to the next mission which is literally right after that level.

444
00:28:51,192 --> 00:28:57,516
What you missed was me jumping through the window, dropping down to the very last bomb plant,

445
00:28:57,576 --> 00:28:59,958
and then jumping over a gap and walking to the end of the level.

446
00:29:02,426 --> 00:29:04,527
There's kind of a weird hack with these turrets too, right?

447
00:29:04,607 --> 00:29:05,648
Like you just walk by one.

448
00:29:05,868 --> 00:29:08,610
I've seen, like I mentioned, I think there's a hack.

449
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:12,212
Oh yeah, the turrets in Fur actually a tiny bit here.

450
00:29:14,473 --> 00:29:15,273
Gotcha.

451
00:29:15,313 --> 00:29:18,115
These later parts look a little bit similar.

452
00:29:18,695 --> 00:29:20,416
You know what's kind of funny about this is

453
00:29:21,777 --> 00:29:23,618
this looks a lot like what it looks like

454
00:29:23,658 --> 00:29:25,599
to see a level designer play their own level.

455
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,362
Some of these, it's not like we deliberately leave

456
00:29:29,462 --> 00:29:31,303
exploits in for our own use.

457
00:29:31,778 --> 00:29:34,541
But you look at them and you're like, well, nobody's going to find that, right?

458
00:29:34,701 --> 00:29:38,144
I, it's only, it's, it's only something I can use because I know it's there.

459
00:29:38,164 --> 00:29:44,290
Um, uh, and so when you, when you're doing what we call a smoke test, where

460
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,753
you're just checking to make sure the thing you just changed didn't break

461
00:29:46,813 --> 00:29:49,616
everything, you know, this is how you run your, your level really.

462
00:29:50,136 --> 00:29:50,516
Yeah.

463
00:29:52,298 --> 00:29:52,378
Um.

464
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,882
Harley, did you want to add anything else about the conversation before Gabe's question?

465
00:29:56,943 --> 00:29:57,783
Sorry, I cut you off.

466
00:29:57,863 --> 00:30:02,307
I'm sorry, I can't remember what we were talking about, so if you'll remind me, maybe?

467
00:30:02,888 --> 00:30:05,490
AI for multiplayer squad, like putting squad in multiplayer?

468
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:10,114
Yeah, no, it wasn't something we ever would have really been able to consider just because

469
00:30:10,194 --> 00:30:13,697
of the optimization requirements and wanting to have good-looking arenas.

470
00:30:13,977 --> 00:30:15,699
Yeah.

471
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:20,603
There was a long, long time when the reality was you could have about

472
00:30:21,103 --> 00:30:25,065
five characters on screen, maybe up to eight if they were really optimized, and that was

473
00:30:25,085 --> 00:30:25,565
going to be it.

474
00:30:26,065 --> 00:30:30,107
And so with the numbers of players in the arena, it just wasn't going to work out.

475
00:30:30,127 --> 00:30:31,027
That's good.

476
00:30:31,847 --> 00:30:35,769
Speaking of optimization, what was it like, like you've been involved for a long time,

477
00:30:35,809 --> 00:30:40,270
what was it like optimizing this game for the original Xbox and then later PC?

478
00:30:41,971 --> 00:30:44,752
I forget if it was simultaneous or not, but you know, the original Xbox is sort of what

479
00:30:44,792 --> 00:30:45,332
I'm curious about.

480
00:30:45,692 --> 00:30:46,013
Yeah.

481
00:30:46,193 --> 00:30:50,154
Versus compared to your experience helping your team optimize their games now.

482
00:30:51,663 --> 00:31:01,426
Oh, well, so we developed on PCs that were built as close to the original Xbox config as possible at the time, if I remember correctly.

483
00:31:02,607 --> 00:31:08,689
And so we, it wasn't until pretty late in the game that we had it on the Xbox.

484
00:31:09,689 --> 00:31:12,090
Mostly everything fit and worked okay.

485
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:18,992
There were a few, there were a few problems in terms of textures, texture memory, I remember being a real problem,

486
00:31:19,732 --> 00:31:20,873
and that we had to sort of...

487
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:28,252
and Scrooge-specific textures that showed less down until everything else fit, and that was a long process.

488
00:31:29,612 --> 00:31:30,913
Geometry wasn't too bad.

489
00:31:33,533 --> 00:31:36,874
The thing that was a real surprise, I think, was...

490
00:31:37,134 --> 00:31:40,575
I mean, it was a new console, so you just never know.

491
00:31:41,256 --> 00:31:43,356
I've seen this happen with other new consoles as well.

492
00:31:44,697 --> 00:31:48,218
It was the problem of streaming.

493
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:55,962
You know, this is Unreal 2, I believe, and its streaming capabilities are one of the

494
00:31:55,982 --> 00:32:00,403
reasons we decided to use it, without having to write our own streaming engine.

495
00:32:00,863 --> 00:32:06,665
But until you're on the target hardware, you can't really know how fast you're going to

496
00:32:06,705 --> 00:32:07,285
stream in and out.

497
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:12,026
And there were some places where it was like, oh, no, we are not going to stream that fast

498
00:32:12,086 --> 00:32:12,266
enough.

499
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:15,747
We are going to have to figure out a way to tap dance right here so that things have a

500
00:32:15,787 --> 00:32:16,447
chance to stream in.

501
00:32:18,283 --> 00:32:22,626
the Kashyyyk tree as you go up the tree, you'll actually see some of those and

502
00:32:22,967 --> 00:32:25,288
and uh yeah there are a few of them where

503
00:32:25,468 --> 00:32:29,151
where um we weren't supposed to have a chapter break

504
00:32:29,411 --> 00:32:32,673
but we had to have some kind of break or the it wasn't just gonna just wasn't

505
00:32:32,693 --> 00:32:37,056
gonna be able to do it. That makes sense uh looking back at chat

506
00:32:37,336 --> 00:32:40,798
uh Heath uh says uh from the from the skip from a few

507
00:32:40,838 --> 00:32:44,461
minutes ago, they can't stop moving in their seat to

508
00:32:44,561 --> 00:32:46,602
to help you get uh once we get over that rock.

509
00:32:48,689 --> 00:32:50,310
Coltzone Games just wants to say hi.

510
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:53,410
Hey Coltzone, I've seen some of your tweets on GDC Summer this week.

511
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,850
I hope you're having a good time.

512
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:58,971
I think you are, so I'm glad you joined us.

513
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:03,672
Gabe is throwing great questions one after another.

514
00:33:04,452 --> 00:33:08,553
One of the things they remember desperately wanting when they first played Republic

515
00:33:08,573 --> 00:33:12,374
Window was a level where you operate the turret on airborne transport.

516
00:33:12,434 --> 00:33:16,155
Was anything like that ever prototyped and would similar optimization constraints apply?

517
00:33:17,481 --> 00:33:28,544
Yeah, we did some early prototypes about a variety of different things where you might be on a moving platform vehicle, etc.

518
00:33:29,524 --> 00:33:35,985
But at the time, the state-of-the-art and the level of physics simulation we could do,

519
00:33:36,345 --> 00:33:42,607
it was so prohibitively expensive that we weren't able to make that work and make things like enemies work.

520
00:33:42,627 --> 00:33:46,008
You know, these days it would be pretty...

521
00:33:47,822 --> 00:33:53,625
pretty simple to do. But he was asking a lot of the machines we

522
00:33:53,645 --> 00:33:55,326
got available.

523
00:33:55,446 --> 00:33:59,168
I love I love when you consider the technical limitations of any

524
00:33:59,268 --> 00:34:04,051
art actually, whether it's film, music, or games. And you dig

525
00:34:04,071 --> 00:34:07,093
into sort of how the art is informed by the technical, you

526
00:34:07,113 --> 00:34:09,694
know, by those technical limitations, you know, like,

527
00:34:09,834 --> 00:34:10,014
think

528
00:34:12,244 --> 00:34:14,626
how lenses physically morph the look of film,

529
00:34:14,746 --> 00:34:17,709
or how games, depending on how much memory was available,

530
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,531
could only ship certain features,

531
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:21,153
even if something may have been executable

532
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:25,037
on the perfect machine, but not on every machine.

533
00:34:25,097 --> 00:34:25,437
I love it.

534
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:26,658
I love thinking about games like that,

535
00:34:26,678 --> 00:34:27,319
because it's always like,

536
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,181
once you understand the restrictions,

537
00:34:29,221 --> 00:34:30,703
you sort of understand the art, I feel like.

538
00:34:31,343 --> 00:34:31,523
Yeah.

539
00:34:32,102 --> 00:34:36,623
Yeah, it's also really interesting how in any console's life cycle,

540
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:43,645
early on you get a bunch of games that are trying to take a big swing at what this new console can do.

541
00:34:44,425 --> 00:34:49,086
As teams get really good at pushing the console to its very limits,

542
00:34:49,426 --> 00:34:51,947
you begin to see some really amazing stuff.

543
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:57,688
And then with the next console life cycle, that stuff is all just de rigueur.

544
00:34:58,008 --> 00:35:00,288
And now you've got teams pushing new stuff.

545
00:35:01,175 --> 00:35:04,978
You know, there are conversations that happen at the end of that five years

546
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,861
that are conversations that would have been completely shut down at the beginning,

547
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:12,865
because like we just don't we just don't have the time to do that.

548
00:35:13,085 --> 00:35:15,427
Oh, we've learned this and this and this and those three games.

549
00:35:15,727 --> 00:35:18,069
We can put them together and make make something possible.

550
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:23,053
PlayStation two was very much the apex of that

551
00:35:23,093 --> 00:35:25,996
because it had such an incredibly long life cycle.

552
00:35:26,776 --> 00:35:27,737
You know, you had you had.

553
00:35:28,195 --> 00:35:31,556
That team is fully dedicated to making games on it for 10 years straight.

554
00:35:31,897 --> 00:35:37,379
And people really, really knew at the end of that console's life cycle how to put it

555
00:35:37,399 --> 00:35:40,121
through its paces and make it do stuff it was never actually meant to do.

556
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,882
Oh, that skip over the rock there, too, was incredible.

557
00:35:42,982 --> 00:35:44,083
That was really fun to watch.

558
00:35:44,523 --> 00:35:48,985
So something I didn't mention is, so you saw me get on and off the turret.

559
00:35:49,686 --> 00:35:54,728
What that does is, for some reason, I don't know what exactly causes it, but getting on

560
00:35:54,768 --> 00:35:55,809
and off of a turret just...

561
00:35:56,844 --> 00:35:59,105
makes you invincible to everything but explosions.

562
00:36:01,307 --> 00:36:02,687
Yeah, I know why that is.

563
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:09,611
It's because we couldn't make the turret's

564
00:36:09,772 --> 00:36:12,853
collision impervious to shots

565
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:15,555
because when you want to take somebody down

566
00:36:15,615 --> 00:36:17,016
by shooting them on the turret,

567
00:36:17,476 --> 00:36:19,537
and you can see past the shield or whatever,

568
00:36:19,797 --> 00:36:21,718
you want that shot to hit as a player, right?

569
00:36:22,298 --> 00:36:28,402
But if you're on the turret, you don't really have the same situational awareness.

570
00:36:29,003 --> 00:36:33,766
And so they can just run up behind you and shoot you, and you can't know that that happened.

571
00:36:33,806 --> 00:36:37,549
And that turned out to be a huge feel-bad in playtesting.

572
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:45,175
And so I'm sure we just made it so that, no, if you're on a turret, you have to be able to see

573
00:36:45,235 --> 00:36:47,757
the threat, and that threat is going to be something that will explode.

574
00:36:49,718 --> 00:36:49,838
So.

575
00:36:50,804 --> 00:36:57,932
It was essentially a way to make sure that the player experience matched what their perception was while they were on the counter-total.

576
00:36:57,972 --> 00:37:00,655
That's so cool. I just love the little, you know,

577
00:37:00,775 --> 00:37:02,336
okay, we solved this problem, it's good.

578
00:37:02,777 --> 00:37:04,819
And then years later, runners are like, hey, wait a minute.

579
00:37:06,261 --> 00:37:08,263
Yeah.

580
00:37:08,323 --> 00:37:10,665
We're going to go to the chat again while we open this dial.

581
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:17,713
Big Law Big Law wants to say that there seems to be a recurring measure with PC releases

582
00:37:17,753 --> 00:37:18,294
around 2005.

583
00:37:19,074 --> 00:37:23,117
One release in particular, Enter the Matrix, has vehicle speed locked to the clock speed

584
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:30,503
of the CPU and as a result modern PCs have the vehicles move far faster than they should.

585
00:37:31,164 --> 00:37:35,147
Taylor D says that there's a lot of runs like that where frame rate is tied to physics and

586
00:37:35,187 --> 00:37:39,811
that unless it's emulated by the game, unless it's emulated, the game is absolutely broken.

587
00:37:40,832 --> 00:37:43,053
Gabe says, sorry for spamming questions.

588
00:37:43,073 --> 00:37:43,974
They just love this game

589
00:37:44,034 --> 00:37:45,314
and the chance to hear from the dev is amazing.

590
00:37:45,574 --> 00:37:47,455
Gabe, don't feel sorry about spamming questions.

591
00:37:47,495 --> 00:37:49,056
We're just trying to make sure everyone

592
00:37:49,076 --> 00:37:50,276
gets a chance to ask questions.

593
00:37:51,217 --> 00:37:52,197
But yours are great.

594
00:37:52,517 --> 00:37:54,038
I'm glad Harley can answer them

595
00:37:54,098 --> 00:37:56,199
and I hope Harley's having as much fun as I am.

596
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:57,499
This is gold.

597
00:37:57,559 --> 00:38:00,340
This is just chef's kiss every five minutes.

598
00:38:00,921 --> 00:38:02,841
How many times do you use the turret hat?

599
00:38:02,861 --> 00:38:03,302
Three times.

600
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,251
Also, something you missed there was,

601
00:38:12,411 --> 00:38:13,871
there's a whole section where you wait

602
00:38:13,911 --> 00:38:15,792
for a bridge to extend for about a minute,

603
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:17,893
but you can jump off of the console,

604
00:38:18,253 --> 00:38:19,753
around a corner, onto some collision,

605
00:38:19,773 --> 00:38:22,534
just walk over to where the bridge is supposed to be.

606
00:38:23,394 --> 00:38:24,435
Oh yeah, I just leveled.

607
00:38:24,855 --> 00:38:27,035
I saw that when I checked the run out.

608
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:28,516
You aren't actually supposed to get up there,

609
00:38:28,576 --> 00:38:29,876
but if you use that console,

610
00:38:29,896 --> 00:38:31,777
then you can get up high enough.

611
00:38:31,937 --> 00:38:38,879
Yeah, I mean, speaking of optimizing physics,

612
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:47,341
Absolutely, the cheapest way to do physics is to have collision where the player will

613
00:38:47,361 --> 00:38:50,983
be able to walk later and have things animate into that space, right?

614
00:38:51,023 --> 00:38:52,664
And I'm sure we did that a great deal here.

615
00:38:53,424 --> 00:38:58,347
I'm trying to think of a place that I'm sure that we actually used simulated physics to

616
00:38:58,407 --> 00:38:59,688
change the path.

617
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:06,251
I might be able, when we get to the levels that I actually put together, I might be able

618
00:39:06,271 --> 00:39:07,112
to find one, but...

619
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,413
Oh, I am, I cannot wait for us to get the machine.

620
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,771
Let's just say that.

621
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:14,891
So here's something kind of neat.

622
00:39:14,991 --> 00:39:19,172
This Geonosian Elite cannot hurt you if you enter this hack

623
00:39:19,472 --> 00:39:20,032
from an angle.

624
00:39:21,232 --> 00:39:21,972
Fascinating.

625
00:39:22,292 --> 00:39:23,953
Also, something I've noticed about some

626
00:39:23,973 --> 00:39:26,893
of these demolition charges, some of them hurt you,

627
00:39:27,033 --> 00:39:27,954
and some of them don't.

628
00:39:30,394 --> 00:39:32,614
Some of them, like, you can be right up close to,

629
00:39:32,834 --> 00:39:35,415
and you'll only lose a tiny bit of shield.

630
00:39:35,735 --> 00:39:38,276
Some of them, like that one, you'll

631
00:39:38,296 --> 00:39:40,376
explode it, like, right up to it, and it'll just kill you.

632
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:42,740
Interesting.

633
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,361
So the ones that you see me back up from, those are the ones that actually do damage.

634
00:39:46,462 --> 00:39:49,463
The ones that I just shove my face into, I don't care about.

635
00:39:50,684 --> 00:39:57,687
Sounds like some inconsistent parent-child relationships in the prefabs in Unreal.

636
00:39:59,048 --> 00:40:01,349
That's funny, I know that that's a technical thing, but you're just like,

637
00:40:01,429 --> 00:40:04,210
oh, it sounds like some inconsistent parent-child relationships,

638
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:05,951
and I'm like, oh boy, I've been there.

639
00:40:07,232 --> 00:40:08,793
Well, I've both as a parent and a child.

640
00:40:11,178 --> 00:40:17,942
Yeah, so one of the things that I did on this game besides level design was help set up the

641
00:40:18,202 --> 00:40:27,527
technical art pipeline for the maneuvers, including the door breaches and stuff.

642
00:40:28,347 --> 00:40:31,429
When you have assets like that that are used over and over and over again,

643
00:40:31,449 --> 00:40:31,889
heal things, etc.

644
00:40:39,155 --> 00:40:45,097
The way that it's built in the engine is very hierarchical, so that you have different elements that you can add onto the model to make it work.

645
00:40:46,217 --> 00:40:51,119
And if people copy that for some reason, because they want to make a broken one or whatever,

646
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:55,541
you can get into a situation where people are using very slightly different versions,

647
00:40:55,861 --> 00:41:02,023
and then you think you've made a decision about, this is the final version, it will or won't kill people when it explodes in front of them.

648
00:41:02,403 --> 00:41:05,564
But you can certainly get into a spot where...

649
00:41:06,775 --> 00:41:11,037
Unless you're extremely careful with what is deployed to the level, because I received

650
00:41:11,057 --> 00:41:15,459
that in different versions available.

651
00:41:15,499 --> 00:41:18,241
Going from chat, Utsu, we have a question for you.

652
00:41:18,261 --> 00:41:23,283
Alex Jacobson would like to know, how well do you know the process around how a lot of

653
00:41:23,404 --> 00:41:26,125
route skips are found in Game Freakies?

654
00:41:26,185 --> 00:41:30,327
A lot of what skips?

655
00:41:30,547 --> 00:41:36,190
How well do you know the process around how a lot of the route and skips were found?

656
00:41:37,612 --> 00:41:43,856
I know next to nothing for this for how they were found in this game since I showed up again only a

657
00:41:43,896 --> 00:41:50,641
few months ago when um all of this stuff was already found there's been very little found

658
00:41:50,721 --> 00:41:57,785
I think the only thing recent that's been found since I showed up which again the the community

659
00:41:57,845 --> 00:41:59,826
isn't very like together

660
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:06,242
in like the sense of like there's uh there's one singular discord where like

661
00:42:06,822 --> 00:42:12,084
everybody is a big community and everything there's just one gigantic star wars discord

662
00:42:13,245 --> 00:42:22,628
that uh oh dear um so it actually took me a while to actually even get resources for

663
00:42:22,688 --> 00:42:27,810
learning this run i don't even remember if i knew that you could shoot those containers down

664
00:42:28,291 --> 00:42:30,651
when i played the game

665
00:42:31,467 --> 00:42:33,168
Okay, I'm gonna do something for my sanity.

666
00:42:34,348 --> 00:42:35,469
I was gonna say, I wonder, I was like,

667
00:42:35,509 --> 00:42:37,069
are you actually playing on easy difficulty?

668
00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:39,610
I am on easy, but I think something might've gone wrong

669
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:42,351
with me hitting new game.

670
00:42:42,371 --> 00:42:45,012
Because usually runs are started just from a save

671
00:42:45,052 --> 00:42:46,713
just to skip the intro cutscene.

672
00:42:47,853 --> 00:42:48,413
Oh, I see.

673
00:42:48,553 --> 00:42:49,774
And it's felt like this whole time

674
00:42:49,814 --> 00:42:52,115
that I've been taking just way more damage than usual.

675
00:42:52,655 --> 00:42:53,835
Yeah, I was noticing that,

676
00:42:53,855 --> 00:42:55,276
because I watched, like I said.

677
00:42:55,514 --> 00:42:59,557
I was like, hmm, that's more than I saw before.

678
00:42:59,638 --> 00:43:01,299
Going for questions in chat again,

679
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:04,121
JD4 would like to ask, it seems like there's so much going on

680
00:43:04,141 --> 00:43:07,204
in terms of action gameplay and level complexity.

681
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:09,326
Was it difficult to address narrative pacing?

682
00:43:09,366 --> 00:43:10,507
That's a question for you, Harley.

683
00:43:11,628 --> 00:43:11,808
Um...

684
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:16,071
Sometimes. I mean, we...

685
00:43:16,772 --> 00:43:19,074
The way the levels were made, right,

686
00:43:19,154 --> 00:43:22,116
we essentially did a block out of the level first and said,

687
00:43:22,156 --> 00:43:24,578
okay, here's where we're gonna fight and here's where we're gonna...

688
00:43:25,133 --> 00:43:32,355
narrative stuff and here's where we're going to have a rest. And I know that as we got deeper

689
00:43:32,495 --> 00:43:37,597
into the development, things like door breaches, you know, sometimes we deliberately put them there

690
00:43:37,617 --> 00:43:42,758
so the players would have a chance to take a break and rest and or so that your squad members could

691
00:43:42,858 --> 00:43:49,680
say things that contributed to the narrative. So most of that stuff is pretty well blocked out

692
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,041
before you end up.

693
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:55,092
uh, hooking up, you know, the bulk of the action gameplay.

694
00:43:56,073 --> 00:43:57,775
Uh, there are certainly times when it doesn't work,

695
00:43:58,035 --> 00:44:00,217
and you've got to figure out what to do then.

696
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:03,740
Um, those aren't usually bugs so much as it just feels really weird,

697
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,882
for example, to go from this great big fight

698
00:44:06,222 --> 00:44:09,025
into this sort of quiet introspective cutscene or whatever.

699
00:44:09,045 --> 00:44:09,085
Um...

700
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:15,341
And sometimes, you know, you do things like, okay, well, let's try routing the player around.

701
00:44:15,401 --> 00:44:20,802
And in levels like this, where the hallways are pretty modular, and it's not super hard

702
00:44:21,122 --> 00:44:24,903
to take the modules you have and build a new hallway or reroute a hallway, you can do stuff

703
00:44:24,923 --> 00:44:25,843
like that pretty easily.

704
00:44:26,884 --> 00:44:29,604
But not late in the game, once all the scripting has hooked up.

705
00:44:29,624 --> 00:44:32,945
Because the scripting gets extremely, extraordinarily complicated.

706
00:44:34,365 --> 00:44:36,446
You want to know all of that stuff pretty early on.

707
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:44,117
Utsu, I've seen you do this hack with the spider droids a couple times where you manage to get into their spawn point before they emerge into the proper combat area.

708
00:44:44,637 --> 00:44:46,839
Would you be able to describe that hack for us?

709
00:44:46,859 --> 00:44:55,688
Well, that's not even really a hack, it's just walking towards it before the game intended for you to even be there.

710
00:44:56,268 --> 00:44:58,490
Yeah.

711
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:01,053
It's the simplest hack, walk in the door and act like you belong.

712
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:06,693
Josh Dua would like to ask, were there any constraints in Unreal Engine 2 that limited

713
00:45:06,713 --> 00:45:09,475
the team's vision for level design?

714
00:45:11,277 --> 00:45:15,060
Um, yes, absolutely.

715
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:17,802
I mean every level has constraints that limit the vision, right?

716
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:25,688
The first thing a designer asks themselves is not what grand vision do I have, but what

717
00:45:25,708 --> 00:45:28,070
are the constraints that I actually have to pay attention to?

718
00:45:30,656 --> 00:45:34,177
And this one certainly was no exception.

719
00:45:34,637 --> 00:45:37,298
Trying to think of specific stuff...

720
00:45:40,178 --> 00:45:44,920
That version of Unreal, and honestly, just the hardware that we're running on, again,

721
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:49,441
it was very difficult to have a really big arena,

722
00:45:50,101 --> 00:45:53,682
and also any of the connective tissue to the rest of the levels.

723
00:45:53,742 --> 00:45:57,583
So you'll notice that we very often have a short hallway, and...

724
00:45:58,914 --> 00:46:04,116
and you know that there's the the hallway takes as long as it takes to load door closes and you can

725
00:46:04,156 --> 00:46:11,060
never get through that again right that's that's all um uh you know and given our druthers most

726
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:16,403
level designers would prefer not to have arena hallway arena hallway gameplay but it's pretty

727
00:46:16,543 --> 00:46:26,208
difficult um to do that when that's sort of the way that the uh software wants to be run um uh so

728
00:46:26,847 --> 00:46:29,668
There are a lot of different tricks that we use to make it feel less like that.

729
00:46:32,229 --> 00:46:34,390
But certainly it does come up in this game.

730
00:46:36,991 --> 00:46:39,672
Next question, Michael Gibbs would like to ask Harley,

731
00:46:39,732 --> 00:46:41,413
what made you want to be a level designer?

732
00:46:41,433 --> 00:46:45,054
It seems like you get to wear multiple hats of programming and art in gameplay.

733
00:46:46,034 --> 00:46:48,535
That's basically what made me want to be a level designer.

734
00:46:50,133 --> 00:46:55,875
I started out as an art tech in the industry, and I really liked art teching, you know, it was...

735
00:46:56,595 --> 00:47:00,996
I really liked the system design aspect of it, the technical aspect was fun, the team aspect was great,

736
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:10,779
but I saw level designers getting to take portions of every discipline and put it on a plate and

737
00:47:10,819 --> 00:47:15,440
arrange it in a beautiful way to serve up to players, and that's what I wanted to do.

738
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,861
Um, and...

739
00:47:20,412 --> 00:47:29,255
You know, there's something about the crux of your gameplay being architectural rather

740
00:47:29,295 --> 00:47:32,316
than systemic that just really appealed to me.

741
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:37,658
It made me think about places in a different and deeper way.

742
00:47:39,458 --> 00:47:45,961
And having been a level designer at a reasonably large portion of my career, I still think

743
00:47:46,001 --> 00:47:47,321
about places in a different way.

744
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:53,606
in a different way. It's affected everything in my life, honestly, from the way I set up

745
00:47:53,646 --> 00:48:00,192
my house. My house is set up with systems for optimized efficiency in a way that I think

746
00:48:00,832 --> 00:48:05,937
few people do. They're thinking more, is it pretty? And I'm thinking, how many steps does

747
00:48:05,977 --> 00:48:08,179
it take to do this or that, or et cetera?

748
00:48:14,657 --> 00:48:18,580
I think also the fact that I had a strong technical background as a technical artist

749
00:48:18,881 --> 00:48:24,365
and a strong art background because I went to school for photography really drew me to

750
00:48:24,405 --> 00:48:27,207
something that let me integrate all of those things at once.

751
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:33,653
And then also you get to be in the play tests if you're a level designer and being the person

752
00:48:33,673 --> 00:48:36,635
who actually gets to be there live and watch people.

753
00:48:37,329 --> 00:48:42,432
Not necessarily do this, because you rarely get a speedrunner in playtesting, but watch

754
00:48:42,472 --> 00:48:46,554
people be the first people to enjoy the game or hate it.

755
00:48:46,774 --> 00:48:47,915
It has its own kind of gravity.

756
00:48:49,336 --> 00:48:53,698
Roger that.

757
00:48:54,279 --> 00:48:59,922
I think it's interesting, Utsu does this a couple times in the run, where she chooses

758
00:48:59,962 --> 00:49:04,184
to be the actor that's interacting with the big, the tense making of the game.

759
00:49:06,996 --> 00:49:09,398
timing thing where you have to hit the terminal for like a minute.

760
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:14,403
And it's interesting to watch her do that as the player instead of doing what most players

761
00:49:14,423 --> 00:49:15,704
do, which is, hey clone, go do it.

762
00:49:15,764 --> 00:49:20,548
Now I'm down in a clone, I have to juggle my soldiers as I sand the situation.

763
00:49:21,669 --> 00:49:25,473
As a designer, what's it like to sort of watch a player make that choice to like look away

764
00:49:25,533 --> 00:49:30,718
from the combat and look away from all the spaces you've built and just stare at the

765
00:49:30,758 --> 00:49:32,420
wall by themselves for a minute?

766
00:49:33,042 --> 00:49:36,283
Well, I mean, it's watching somebody who's gone through the looking glass, right?

767
00:49:36,824 --> 00:49:40,485
So much of making a game like this is smoke and mirrors, right?

768
00:49:40,585 --> 00:49:45,908
And so if the player chooses to put another squad member on that thing,

769
00:49:46,008 --> 00:49:50,130
you want to have essentially a play unfold in front of them that they get to engage in

770
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:52,672
in terms of defending that person on the console.

771
00:49:53,272 --> 00:49:57,934
But if they are on the console themselves, you definitely don't want them feeling like,

772
00:49:57,994 --> 00:50:00,536
I just got shot in the back a hundred times and that was no fun.

773
00:50:01,685 --> 00:50:04,325
And so watching somebody make that choice in this game is,

774
00:50:04,425 --> 00:50:07,146
oh, you understand how there are times

775
00:50:07,186 --> 00:50:09,066
when we're essentially doing a stage play,

776
00:50:09,327 --> 00:50:11,287
and there are times when we're actively doing

777
00:50:12,147 --> 00:50:14,408
what combat that you as a player engage in,

778
00:50:14,468 --> 00:50:17,088
and you've been able to perceive the difference

779
00:50:17,168 --> 00:50:18,469
between those times.

780
00:50:18,509 --> 00:50:20,649
Does that make sense?

781
00:50:20,929 --> 00:50:22,770
Yes.

782
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:27,371
Something that I compare that whole one-man hacking section

783
00:50:27,411 --> 00:50:27,891
to is a...

784
00:50:28,563 --> 00:50:32,505
the scene in the amazing spider-man where stan lee is a librarian and he's just kind of

785
00:50:32,965 --> 00:50:36,847
dusting off and cleaning books while all the action is happening behind him and he yeah

786
00:50:38,187 --> 00:50:44,189
yeah i do so three is just hacking away and behind him it's just explosions and

787
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:51,112
robots dying i was like i'm hit and he was like oh there's the codes cool yeah

788
00:50:52,736 --> 00:50:54,477
Utsu, this section of the game is interesting.

789
00:50:54,517 --> 00:51:01,482
We're going through a whole level that is just the clones exploring an abandoned Republic

790
00:51:01,522 --> 00:51:02,182
capital ship.

791
00:51:03,543 --> 00:51:08,467
And the interesting thing to me is that there's a lot less skips in this section.

792
00:51:08,487 --> 00:51:11,088
At least I noticed a lot less when I was watching a previous run.

793
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:16,892
In part because for a while you're separated from the rest of the clones and you can't

794
00:51:16,932 --> 00:51:19,254
send them off to handle something while you stand by the door.

795
00:51:21,013 --> 00:51:25,076
What are your thoughts as a runner about how this part of the game feels compared to the

796
00:51:25,496 --> 00:51:27,037
first and third sections?

797
00:51:27,477 --> 00:51:32,541
I like this level, this is my favorite level a whole lot more because in terms of the run,

798
00:51:32,561 --> 00:51:34,102
it feels a whole lot more true to the intent of the game.

799
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:46,803
I've always said that every level has a theme. Geonosis has the like rubble climbing and hopping over things.

800
00:51:47,343 --> 00:51:53,569
This game is just, this level is just a full-on organizing your squad.

801
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:57,413
Just making the best use out of them as you possibly can.

802
00:51:58,374 --> 00:52:03,159
It's really interesting to hear you talk about the themes as...

803
00:52:04,377 --> 00:52:08,420
as basically player verbs rather than narrative themes

804
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,961
or sort of higher level interactive themes.

805
00:52:11,522 --> 00:52:14,383
It's fascinating that the lens you bring to it,

806
00:52:14,443 --> 00:52:16,545
which makes sense given what you're doing.

807
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:19,667
We love to talk about lenses when we're around shell games

808
00:52:19,747 --> 00:52:21,888
because that's what Jesse's whole book was about.

809
00:52:22,829 --> 00:52:26,871
Jesse's shell, the shell of shell games.

810
00:52:27,052 --> 00:52:28,132
We're gonna go to chat real quick

811
00:52:28,152 --> 00:52:30,454
while we let this area begin.

812
00:52:33,259 --> 00:52:35,660
Uh, Misha, uh, sorry, I'm far away from my screen.

813
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:40,542
Misha Samorodin, uh, would like to say it's funny how level design can apply to real life.

814
00:52:41,062 --> 00:52:46,604
Um, Taylor D, uh, back again, would like to say that speedrunners make excellent QA, by the way.

815
00:52:46,624 --> 00:52:52,346
Uh, they know that Naughty Dog hired, uh, Oven Donkey, an uncharted runner, to QA test Uncharted 4.

816
00:52:54,959 --> 00:52:57,763
We actually had Dave actually pop the question for us yesterday.

817
00:52:57,783 --> 00:53:00,007
We were speedrunning on Nucleolian and he was there.

818
00:53:00,107 --> 00:53:02,891
Just wanted to like, you know, discuss about getting into QA.

819
00:53:03,512 --> 00:53:06,076
Harley, what are your thoughts for like runners who want to get into QA?

820
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:06,937
Or anyone in general.

821
00:53:06,957 --> 00:53:07,618
Like who want...

822
00:53:07,838 --> 00:53:09,140
For people who want to professionally...

823
00:53:10,448 --> 00:53:15,390
play video games all day and every QA person just tried to shoot me from afar

824
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:19,611
from wherever they're sitting. What are your thoughts about getting in and

825
00:53:20,092 --> 00:53:25,513
succeeding in that field? So I do think that there are some real

826
00:53:25,573 --> 00:53:29,675
strengths to being a speedrunner if you're looking for a gig as QA, right?

827
00:53:29,775 --> 00:53:32,696
You've already proven that you can successfully

828
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:36,457
reproduce games and reproduce bugs and you know

829
00:53:36,617 --> 00:53:37,957
what those reproduction steps are.

830
00:53:39,767 --> 00:53:45,069
it's super important to be able to communicate that in a way that devs can understand,

831
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:50,772
and to be able to represent what's important to the player and what's not. And again, right,

832
00:53:50,792 --> 00:53:54,954
you've got that wide range of player types that you've got to be able to represent for.

833
00:53:54,974 --> 00:53:55,774
But I wouldn't...

834
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:08,917
I wouldn't think it unreasonable to, if you're trying to get in as QA and you haven't held

835
00:54:08,957 --> 00:54:15,503
that position for, you know, to sort of, rather than showcase a whole speedrun, show how you've

836
00:54:15,783 --> 00:54:23,289
found and made reproducible above in a company's game, and then written up those steps so that

837
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:26,372
they can see how you would go about communicating about that.

838
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:32,894
you know, even how you describe the bug and its impact is important there.

839
00:54:35,676 --> 00:54:40,218
So, yeah, I can totally see companies being really interested in that,

840
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:44,301
especially if they've got a game type for which that matters, right?

841
00:54:44,341 --> 00:54:46,883
There are game types that doesn't matter much.

842
00:54:48,964 --> 00:54:50,285
It seems viable.

843
00:54:50,925 --> 00:54:54,267
Yeah. Heath, while on the subject of career,

844
00:54:55,219 --> 00:54:56,900
Keith Close again would like to ask,

845
00:54:56,941 --> 00:54:58,442
what are the most important skills to have

846
00:54:58,482 --> 00:54:59,743
when looking for a level designer

847
00:54:59,823 --> 00:55:00,684
or wanting to become one?

848
00:55:01,844 --> 00:55:04,687
Oh, the most important skills.

849
00:55:05,948 --> 00:55:08,450
Probably the first one is communication.

850
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:12,453
A level designer is the person who takes

851
00:55:12,493 --> 00:55:15,515
and showcases the work of every person on the team

852
00:55:15,756 --> 00:55:17,457
on screen in front of the player, right?

853
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:20,680
And so you have to be somebody that the whole team.

854
00:55:21,237 --> 00:55:28,059
can trust and can talk to about the situation of how is their work going to look and how

855
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:37,980
is it going to be showcased rather than made to look weird or strange. That's the number

856
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:43,341
one. Second, I would think, is a pretty decent understanding of architecture. You need to

857
00:55:43,401 --> 00:55:48,842
know how people move in space and how they expect space to move around them in order

858
00:55:48,903 --> 00:55:49,863
to do level design well.

859
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:55,721
less so if it's mission design, you know, you get a space shooter, architecture doesn't come in that

860
00:55:55,801 --> 00:56:05,864
relevant. But architecture is super important. Some kind of good understanding of dramatic

861
00:56:06,945 --> 00:56:16,647
rhythm, whether that's, you know, having a background in playwriting or understanding TV,

862
00:56:18,571 --> 00:56:23,133
Because you're not only setting up the action, you're also setting up the storytelling, right?

863
00:56:23,153 --> 00:56:30,256
You don't build the cutscene, but you make sure that the cutscene is produced for the player in

864
00:56:30,356 --> 00:56:38,099
its optimum way, and from the perspective where they walk in the room, they can't miss it,

865
00:56:38,139 --> 00:56:39,600
and also it doesn't feel weird, right?

866
00:56:39,999 --> 00:56:42,920
We've all walked into a room cutscene and it's like,

867
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:45,361
oh, this isn't quite feeling right,

868
00:56:45,461 --> 00:56:47,401
or you moved me 10 feet to the left

869
00:56:47,441 --> 00:56:48,501
and I understood, whatever.

870
00:56:48,802 --> 00:56:49,982
Sometimes you're forced into that,

871
00:56:50,082 --> 00:56:52,342
but the more you can take care

872
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:54,423
not to have stuff like that happen,

873
00:56:54,823 --> 00:56:57,344
the more your team is going to appreciate

874
00:56:57,384 --> 00:56:58,264
how you're showing them work.

875
00:56:58,924 --> 00:57:00,265
Yeah, I just realized something else.

876
00:57:00,285 --> 00:57:01,845
These turrets are not really hurting you too.

877
00:57:03,265 --> 00:57:08,290
So uh no no they aren't so uh something that uh I want to show off so you saw how I walked in this

878
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:16,176
was just a whole big battleground cutscene yeah well I'm just gonna go and do that quick save

879
00:57:16,196 --> 00:57:29,668
quick load bug and it doesn't happen anymore oh my goodness that nice it it just kind of

880
00:57:30,876 --> 00:57:36,419
something in the code just never goes through to spawn everybody and engage the battle so you just

881
00:57:36,439 --> 00:57:41,161
kind of get to walk through these guys spawn just fine but not uh

882
00:57:42,722 --> 00:57:50,325
not anything else that's fascinating um yeah different set of triggers no it's all right

883
00:57:50,385 --> 00:57:55,087
interrupt any time yeah we want we want to we want to celebrate the like i said we want to

884
00:57:55,127 --> 00:58:00,250
celebrate the the line between what was intended and what what what's there um

885
00:58:01,733 --> 00:58:04,694
Harley, I have a, before we get back to chat, I have a question that we can talk about this

886
00:58:04,754 --> 00:58:04,994
level.

887
00:58:05,094 --> 00:58:09,576
Rewatching this run, I appreciated how the setup for this level is to give this spooky

888
00:58:09,616 --> 00:58:09,936
feel.

889
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:13,698
Gabe in chat mentions that separating you from your squad adds to that, you know, that

890
00:58:13,778 --> 00:58:18,400
nervous feeling, that tension before going into a space.

891
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:22,221
It's interesting where this level goes from there because there's kind of this mystery

892
00:58:22,241 --> 00:58:25,122
about, you know, why are there Trandoshans here if you're a Star Wars renewer like me?

893
00:58:25,162 --> 00:58:29,284
the Trandoshans are a lizard race that's really into slave trade.

894
00:58:30,305 --> 00:58:35,289
that do not appear to be aligned with the droid army at first,

895
00:58:35,409 --> 00:58:37,311
although this level certainly shows they are later on.

896
00:58:37,751 --> 00:58:41,574
There's kind of like an ambiguity to the whole start of it that sort of

897
00:58:41,634 --> 00:58:44,837
doesn't feel like to me as a player, like that ambiguity never has

898
00:58:44,857 --> 00:58:47,859
like a big reveal or anything, the droids just sort of make their way into the story.

899
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:53,964
What were sort of your thoughts, do you remember anything about what the team was discussing at the time with this level

900
00:58:54,304 --> 00:58:56,086
and playing that ambiguity into...

901
00:58:56,855 --> 00:58:57,596
into the game.

902
00:58:57,636 --> 00:58:59,376
Also, I appreciate how this part of Utsu's run

903
00:58:59,416 --> 00:59:01,077
is just waiting for everyone to walk in.

904
00:59:01,097 --> 00:59:02,998
They got to spawn, right?

905
00:59:03,018 --> 00:59:04,278
You can't just spawn them right there.

906
00:59:04,339 --> 00:59:04,719
So, yep.

907
00:59:05,859 --> 00:59:09,541
Yeah, so this, you're absolutely right

908
00:59:09,601 --> 00:59:13,923
that removing the squad was a big thing.

909
00:59:14,043 --> 00:59:16,904
And like, they had just done a level

910
00:59:16,984 --> 00:59:18,605
in which having the squad have your back

911
00:59:18,645 --> 00:59:19,765
was super important, right?

912
00:59:19,785 --> 00:59:22,866
So having that feeling of being sort of out alone

913
00:59:23,707 --> 00:59:24,927
was important to the tension.

914
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:37,582
The question of the Trandoshans, it really comes down to this was an interstitial plot point in our minds between two movies, right?

915
00:59:38,882 --> 00:59:46,544
And we wanted to make sure that you were able to discover something that maybe is obvious in the second movie,

916
00:59:47,184 --> 00:59:49,624
but that you were there for understanding that.

917
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:57,434
when those two factions ally.

918
00:59:57,474 --> 00:59:59,015
We wanted it to feel like,

919
00:59:59,155 --> 01:00:01,137
oh, well, yeah, you started out just as a clone

920
01:00:01,177 --> 01:00:03,538
and you're just running around doing your thing,

921
01:00:03,598 --> 01:00:07,201
but you stumble into a sort of conspiracy

922
01:00:07,742 --> 01:00:09,063
of enormous proportions.

923
01:00:09,963 --> 01:00:11,885
And so this is the beginning of that.

924
01:00:11,905 --> 01:00:13,486
Like, these guys don't belong here

925
01:00:13,506 --> 01:00:16,448
and what are they doing overall?

926
01:00:17,929 --> 01:00:19,210
Doesn't make a lot of sense.

927
01:00:20,711 --> 01:00:21,912
The reveal might be...

928
01:00:24,381 --> 01:00:27,904
a little bit extended.

929
01:00:29,985 --> 01:00:39,252
You know, the environmental storytelling in this level is just so good.

930
01:00:39,272 --> 01:00:43,736
I remember the first time I played it, I was like, this is just great.

931
01:00:43,916 --> 01:00:47,298
And I played the game again recently, a couple of months ago,

932
01:00:47,318 --> 01:00:49,860
and I had exactly the same reaction.

933
01:00:50,901 --> 01:00:52,542
Both in the moment, saying...

934
01:00:52,865 --> 01:00:55,006
the environmental storytelling in this level is so good.

935
01:00:56,446 --> 01:01:00,108
And also remembering that feeling of,

936
01:01:00,208 --> 01:01:02,189
wow, the environmental storytelling is so good

937
01:01:02,229 --> 01:01:03,549
and this is how to do it.

938
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:06,430
We'll get back to some questions in chat,

939
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:08,151
but I'll just finish off with another

940
01:01:08,611 --> 01:01:10,392
kind of Star Wars nerd comment.

941
01:01:10,652 --> 01:01:12,613
Yeah, I actually didn't sort of fully realize

942
01:01:12,633 --> 01:01:13,994
that there's kind of an interesting thing

943
01:01:14,014 --> 01:01:16,135
because this whole game winds up in Kashyyyk,

944
01:01:16,475 --> 01:01:19,276
the through line, which is, at the time was,

945
01:01:19,396 --> 01:01:21,157
like it had made in a lot of Star Wars

946
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:22,257
the thing with material was.

947
01:01:22,767 --> 01:01:27,110
how the Trandoshans were sort of the mortal enemy of the Wookiees and they enslaved them

948
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:31,853
and that leading to Kashyyyk which is a big set piece from episode 3, Revenge of the Sith

949
01:01:31,893 --> 01:01:39,558
and just as a natural flow from Geonosis through this Trandoshan encounter on the ship to Kashyyyk.

950
01:01:40,578 --> 01:01:42,019
I didn't fully appreciate that before.

951
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:45,721
Something that I really like about this level is this part here.

952
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:46,402
Yeah.

953
01:01:47,783 --> 01:01:50,024
An elegant weapon for a more civilized time.

954
01:01:51,447 --> 01:01:53,628
Oh, I missed that every other time.

955
01:01:53,648 --> 01:01:58,569
You just let me turn right and there it is, and he references Episode four.

956
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:01,671
The only lightsaber in the entire game.

957
01:02:02,911 --> 01:02:05,292
I was looking up trivia and it mentioned that you can find one of the games

958
01:02:05,312 --> 01:02:07,053
somewhere, and I was like, Oh, I wonder where it is.

959
01:02:07,973 --> 01:02:08,773
It's actually kind of funny.

960
01:02:09,514 --> 01:02:11,014
This is the same kind of ship.

961
01:02:11,054 --> 01:02:12,635
Just to give a shout out to the devs at Respawn.

962
01:02:12,935 --> 01:02:14,296
This is the same kind of environment that

963
01:02:14,316 --> 01:02:18,077
Spoilers for those who haven't played Jedi Fallen Lord.

964
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:19,278
Three, two, one.

965
01:02:20,196 --> 01:02:21,978
There's a level where they flash back to Order 66

966
01:02:22,018 --> 01:02:24,400
and it takes place on a ship like this.

967
01:02:25,341 --> 01:02:27,583
And you get to, the way they navigate that space

968
01:02:27,623 --> 01:02:30,125
and make that feel, you know, a very orderly space

969
01:02:30,165 --> 01:02:32,047
suddenly feel like threatening to a child.

970
01:02:32,607 --> 01:02:35,330
Mwah, like chef's kiss.

971
01:02:35,410 --> 01:02:36,671
I just keep saying chef's kiss.

972
01:02:37,172 --> 01:02:39,534
Let's go back to chat because y'all are here

973
01:02:39,554 --> 01:02:40,435
to chat with Harley.

974
01:02:40,595 --> 01:02:41,776
I'm just taking a page.

975
01:02:42,196 --> 01:02:42,617
Oh, go for it.

976
01:02:43,077 --> 01:02:44,999
Actually, so first of all, you saw me,

977
01:02:46,384 --> 01:02:52,048
quicksave quickload at the very beginning which let me blow up a wall before I defeat the big guy

978
01:02:52,068 --> 01:02:56,671
and something you've been seeing is I will press the reload button with a full mag and it'll cancel

979
01:02:56,711 --> 01:03:01,215
animations so I can come up to these which usually you have to blow up and just...

980
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:03,136
here it comes

981
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:04,317
nice

982
01:03:12,174 --> 01:03:14,815
So that works, but I guess it is how it works.

983
01:03:14,855 --> 01:03:16,355
40 is just going to be yelling at me like,

984
01:03:16,415 --> 01:03:17,916
don't worry, keep holding them off.

985
01:03:17,996 --> 01:03:18,916
I'll be through soon.

986
01:03:18,976 --> 01:03:23,577
I'll just be here like, like, yeah, yeah, I, I, I gotcha.

987
01:03:24,418 --> 01:03:25,878
I don't, don't worry buddy.

988
01:03:26,638 --> 01:03:29,859
That's awesome.

989
01:03:30,059 --> 01:03:31,140
Let's go back to the chat.

990
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:33,400
Cause like I said, I'm just, I, every,

991
01:03:34,061 --> 01:03:36,841
if I nerd out about Star Wars, I nerd out about Star Wars.

992
01:03:36,881 --> 01:03:39,202
Gabe would like to know, did the holographic HUD elements

993
01:03:39,262 --> 01:03:41,283
present interesting rendering or tech challenges?

994
01:03:43,218 --> 01:03:48,203
Um, probably, but I wasn't super involved in setting that up.

995
01:03:48,624 --> 01:03:54,249
Um, by the time they got to me, um, it was really just these are the assets that you're hooking up

996
01:03:54,370 --> 01:04:00,075
to the to the prefabs in Unreal, um, and making sure that everybody knows which prefabs to use

997
01:04:00,095 --> 01:04:05,761
for which situation. Um, uh, I know that it's, I mean, it's...

998
01:04:06,928 --> 01:04:11,392
You'd think that we wouldn't keep remaking these, but you know, you need to with every

999
01:04:11,452 --> 01:04:12,533
new console generation.

1000
01:04:12,714 --> 01:04:21,081
The holographic stuff in Star Wars is such an important and iconic IP element that, you

1001
01:04:21,882 --> 01:04:23,043
know, it's...

1002
01:04:25,365 --> 01:04:29,710
In some ways, it is a really tempting...

1003
01:04:32,222 --> 01:04:36,647
thing to use as both UI and a way to guide the player and etc etc.

1004
01:04:37,508 --> 01:04:42,134
And so from a game design perspective, one of the things that it, one of the

1005
01:04:42,154 --> 01:04:47,120
challenges it can often pose is you initially overuse it because it's

1006
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:51,205
such a great way to give the player information atop the world.

1007
01:04:53,141 --> 01:04:57,424
But if you overuse it, the players can't tell one part from another, and they, again,

1008
01:04:57,444 --> 01:05:01,948
when the load gets really high, you're essentially spamming them with information that they can't

1009
01:05:01,968 --> 01:05:07,151
process all at once, and so you have to hurt back.

1010
01:05:08,252 --> 01:05:11,835
But yeah, the temptation of, well, it's just an overlay on the world, you can put all the

1011
01:05:11,875 --> 01:05:16,738
information you need in the world, it's easy to lead yourself down that path.

1012
01:05:17,698 --> 01:05:21,480
Kind of interesting because it weirdly like it's a faux augmented reality experience,

1013
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:24,161
even though I'm sure if you pop the camera from the player point of view,

1014
01:05:24,541 --> 01:05:25,342
they would still be there.

1015
01:05:26,442 --> 01:05:29,424
But it's that's sort of a yeah, I'm sure.

1016
01:05:29,544 --> 01:05:34,126
I'm sure actually for people doing augmented reality design like that's something worth considering

1017
01:05:34,146 --> 01:05:38,728
because it's a faux there's a weird overlap there.

1018
01:05:38,748 --> 01:05:40,549
Yeah. Yeah.

1019
01:05:40,897 --> 01:05:43,859
I mean, and that's exactly like that.

1020
01:05:44,119 --> 01:05:46,881
There is a great deal of care and craftsmanship

1021
01:05:46,921 --> 01:05:48,843
that's gone into the whole idea.

1022
01:05:48,983 --> 01:05:51,665
Like this whole HUD, conceptually in the game,

1023
01:05:52,265 --> 01:05:54,487
is the helmet's display, right?

1024
01:05:54,907 --> 01:05:59,291
It's not, it's real in that it's AR in the game.

1025
01:06:00,451 --> 01:06:04,194
And, you know, just took a great deal of thought

1026
01:06:04,354 --> 01:06:05,535
and iteration from,

1027
01:06:07,890 --> 01:06:14,933
the UI designer, but also a huge amount of input from both the rest of the team and playtesters.

1028
01:06:16,494 --> 01:06:19,775
I will point out before I get back to questions from chat that we did see a few minutes ago Utsu

1029
01:06:19,915 --> 01:06:24,977
using the turret hack again, and it's interesting how the speed up component there is by eliminating

1030
01:06:25,017 --> 01:06:29,739
the damage kit variable, Utsu's just able to roll ahead and start completing objectives

1031
01:06:30,039 --> 01:06:33,201
while the transitions are running around kicking 3-8's shins.

1032
01:06:35,685 --> 01:06:42,347
Something you saw right here in that little area up there is if I quicksave and quickload and then

1033
01:06:42,387 --> 01:06:49,230
immediately push W, D, and crouch, I can sort of clip through an invisible wall and let me walk

1034
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:57,892
through which lets me skip a door blowing up sequence which also skips I think a lot of

1035
01:06:57,952 --> 01:07:01,133
enemy spawning and turrets turning on.

1036
01:07:01,884 --> 01:07:03,945
which lets me immediately rescue 6-2.

1037
01:07:05,405 --> 01:07:07,546
And to go off of the helmet thing,

1038
01:07:07,566 --> 01:07:09,807
there actually is an option in-game

1039
01:07:09,827 --> 01:07:13,769
to just turn on a sort of helmet HUD.

1040
01:07:13,789 --> 01:07:19,091
Yep. Ooh. I forget if I played with this.

1041
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:21,492
Oh, I feel like I did, yeah, because I had the ...

1042
01:07:21,532 --> 01:07:24,653
I recognize this health bar.

1043
01:07:25,113 --> 01:07:27,574
Yeah, this is ... That's how I first played the game,

1044
01:07:27,614 --> 01:07:28,955
but as I tried to run it more,

1045
01:07:28,975 --> 01:07:31,596
it just kind of got more in the way.

1046
01:07:33,692 --> 01:07:39,877
It makes sense. Especially if you really are trying to understand everything in the level as you move through.

1047
01:07:39,897 --> 01:07:54,868
If the helmet was stationary, it'd be a bit easier, but it just kind of gets annoying shaking around as I move.

1048
01:07:54,928 --> 01:07:57,810
Speaking of UI, Alex Dudman in chat would like to know,

1049
01:07:58,130 --> 01:08:02,273
what was behind the decision to have the ammo represented on the weapon itself as opposed to a HUD element?

1050
01:08:02,604 --> 01:08:05,489
Which I think a lot of games were experimenting with this at the time.

1051
01:08:05,529 --> 01:08:09,316
You can see on the shotgun right now, the 24, and there's like a light counter down there.

1052
01:08:09,356 --> 01:08:14,746
But the other weapons that the commander uses have little indicators of how many shots are left.

1053
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:20,111
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, the reality is that a first-person shooter, very often,

1054
01:08:20,491 --> 01:08:25,892
the character that you're playing from your own perspective is your gun. So the more you can have

1055
01:08:26,192 --> 01:08:30,653
your gun reflect the state of your character right now, the better, right? And it was as

1056
01:08:30,933 --> 01:08:36,934
simple as that. We just really wanted people to be able to, without having to look at the HUD in

1057
01:08:37,034 --> 01:08:39,035
any way, understand what gun am I using.

1058
01:08:39,445 --> 01:08:43,289
What state is it in? Does it need to be reloaded? How much ammo do I have?

1059
01:08:43,629 --> 01:08:47,754
Especially in a game like this, where you're essentially scrounging ammo all the time.

1060
01:08:48,855 --> 01:08:54,961
Knowing how long it's going to be before you need to make sure you break off combat and go scrounge ammo is incredibly important.

1061
01:08:55,844 --> 01:08:59,765
Josh Goode would like to say that a Blocktober seems to have become a popular outlet for

1062
01:08:59,825 --> 01:09:04,687
demystifying the celebrity of level designer, so that we so often see attributed to players.

1063
01:09:05,047 --> 01:09:09,429
Do you feel that the deconstruction of level design to its most basic components has given

1064
01:09:09,509 --> 01:09:13,070
both existing and prospective devs a common ground for evolving the profession?

1065
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:15,190
Yeah, sure.

1066
01:09:17,071 --> 01:09:23,493
I mean, as an art form, it doesn't advance unless people deconstruct it and put it back

1067
01:09:23,513 --> 01:09:23,853
together.

1068
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:33,515
We don't get fresh blood to have new ideas in level design unless people are finding new avenues into it, right?

1069
01:09:33,595 --> 01:09:38,018
So, yeah, to me it's as simple as that.

1070
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:45,183
Now, to be fair, it's been years since I actually did level design,

1071
01:09:46,164 --> 01:09:50,907
and the moment-to-moment and daily concerns of a level designer are no longer mine.

1072
01:09:51,007 --> 01:09:54,230
I try to use my best memory there, but it's a little bit...

1073
01:09:55,786 --> 01:10:00,629
It's a little bit like trying to remember younger versions of yourself.

1074
01:10:01,890 --> 01:10:03,411
That's such an interesting sentiment.

1075
01:10:04,271 --> 01:10:08,294
Chat seems to really gel with the comment you made about how the gun is your character.

1076
01:10:08,314 --> 01:10:13,177
I guess, you know, with the knife popping out every now and then, you could...

1077
01:10:13,397 --> 01:10:17,660
First-person shooter characters are secretly just like a pair of arms sometimes.

1078
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:21,302
They pretty much are, yeah.

1079
01:10:22,102 --> 01:10:23,023
Optimization-wise...

1080
01:10:23,644 --> 01:10:27,126
If you pulled this camera out, you're definitely not gonna see a character, right?

1081
01:10:27,146 --> 01:10:31,369
Because you can't afford to be animating and rendering a character that the camera doesn't see,

1082
01:10:31,429 --> 01:10:34,450
especially when you're pushing everything to its limit, which we definitely were in this game.

1083
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:38,613
Something I'm gonna do here is, so I just quicksave.

1084
01:10:38,633 --> 01:10:42,276
I'm gonna quickload again, which lets me move in this cutscene.

1085
01:10:42,556 --> 01:10:47,999
But my favorite thing about being able to move in this cutscene is you can kill the advisor.

1086
01:10:50,181 --> 01:10:51,021
Oh no. Oh no!

1087
01:10:52,705 --> 01:10:53,126
Oh no!

1088
01:10:55,467 --> 01:10:58,288
Oh man, my- oh no, my brain broke.

1089
01:10:58,328 --> 01:11:00,289
But yeah, so

1090
01:11:01,009 --> 01:11:04,731
for this whole, uh, dialogue that they're explaining to you like

1091
01:11:05,311 --> 01:11:09,153
what the Trandoshans are doing here and stuff and uh, what you need to do next

1092
01:11:09,953 --> 01:11:11,134
you're just kind of

1093
01:11:11,474 --> 01:11:12,834
running to your next objective.

1094
01:11:14,235 --> 01:11:14,555
So

1095
01:11:16,236 --> 01:11:18,917
you basically cut the time of the level in half.

1096
01:11:21,732 --> 01:11:29,579
Alex Jacobson would like to know was there any thought in playtesting QA or even with yourself Harley about finding skips within levels like the ones that Utsu's done?

1097
01:11:30,279 --> 01:11:46,993
Oh absolutely. The numbers of skips, I mean that's 90% of a level designers job once you've got, once you're at the point where you're only fixing bugs is QA goes in and finds skips and they show, and you just can't believe some of them right?

1098
01:11:48,835 --> 01:11:53,056
It's just a huge, enormous part of that process.

1099
01:11:54,896 --> 01:11:57,336
Some of these, I find myself wondering,

1100
01:11:57,516 --> 01:12:00,737
and I can't tell if this is the developer's bias

1101
01:12:00,917 --> 01:12:03,457
or if this is a possibility and it's real.

1102
01:12:03,517 --> 01:12:07,298
I find myself wondering if difference in processors

1103
01:12:07,358 --> 01:12:11,479
and clock speeds and hardware made things possible now

1104
01:12:11,539 --> 01:12:13,039
that weren't possible on the machines

1105
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:13,919
we were running at the time.

1106
01:12:13,979 --> 01:12:15,659
And I honestly don't know the answer,

1107
01:12:15,899 --> 01:12:17,040
but I want it to be true.

1108
01:12:17,427 --> 01:12:26,836
Because we worked really hard to get this as bulletproof as it could be, and some of

1109
01:12:26,876 --> 01:12:29,959
these are just a little bit like, oh, come on, we would have found that.

1110
01:12:30,339 --> 01:12:31,540
I think we would have found that.

1111
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:32,541
We should have found that.

1112
01:12:36,045 --> 01:12:36,645
Gotcha.

1113
01:12:36,966 --> 01:12:38,207
Let's see here.

1114
01:12:38,948 --> 01:12:39,488
Uh, da da da.

1115
01:12:41,723 --> 01:12:47,508
Walter Giannuzzi points out, wasn't that a premise of early id first-person shooters

1116
01:12:47,528 --> 01:12:49,750
that you didn't have to render the character?

1117
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:56,736
I'm not super familiar with some of the design history of id's early days, however, John

1118
01:12:56,776 --> 01:13:01,560
Romero did a talk about the early programming principles of id and you can, if you have

1119
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:05,823
a conference pass, you can still go watch it because it's archived here on Swapcard

1120
01:13:07,064 --> 01:13:07,745
for a little bit.

1121
01:13:07,805 --> 01:13:09,526
You can just pop in, watch it, it's like you were there.

1122
01:13:11,572 --> 01:13:15,484
Uh, let's see, um, Alex Dudman is replying to Gabe that, uh...

1123
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:20,481
It's programmed that the you know, the advisor shows up in the game as a hologram

1124
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:23,742
But they're still treated as a character by by the game itself

1125
01:13:24,602 --> 01:13:31,884
Yeah, that's obviously the very simple explanation for that. It's just very funny to so so there you saw a little bit of my

1126
01:13:32,604 --> 01:13:38,805
Squad organization I put o7 all the way back there on that sniper terminal. Yeah, so that I could

1127
01:13:39,265 --> 01:13:42,706
Tell him to hack a console that was basically right next to him

1128
01:13:42,726 --> 01:13:43,326
Mm-hmm

1129
01:13:46,987 --> 01:13:50,871
Yeah, I love the forethought about,

1130
01:13:51,031 --> 01:13:54,574
if I've got him there, then he's right next to it kind of stuff.

1131
01:13:57,096 --> 01:14:00,059
That's why this is my favorite level in the entire run.

1132
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:03,882
Just overall, the assault ship just has a lot of that,

1133
01:14:03,922 --> 01:14:07,205
like playing the game in the way that the devs

1134
01:14:07,546 --> 01:14:10,769
truly wanted the player to be experiencing these clones.

1135
01:14:11,609 --> 01:14:11,790
Yeah.

1136
01:14:14,133 --> 01:14:17,636
I'm gonna actually put something up this level. This is levels of detention area

1137
01:14:17,656 --> 01:14:21,739
which the clones joke about like is the translations of the heat. This is also a

1138
01:14:21,799 --> 01:14:28,663
level that visually maps itself to the aesthetics behind A New Hope and the

1139
01:14:28,683 --> 01:14:35,648
intention area on the Death Star. Harley I'm sort of curious because I know that

1140
01:14:35,668 --> 01:14:39,171
like some of that is also the art team and you know how they choose to make it

1141
01:14:39,251 --> 01:14:41,372
make an area look after you all gray box it.

1142
01:14:44,069 --> 01:14:46,631
Where, when you're working with an IP like this,

1143
01:14:46,712 --> 01:14:48,733
like how do you navigate these opportunities

1144
01:14:48,753 --> 01:14:49,574
when you sort of realize like,

1145
01:14:49,594 --> 01:14:51,716
hey, we have the opportunity to draw

1146
01:14:51,796 --> 01:14:53,718
from an existing art style or an existing space

1147
01:14:54,138 --> 01:14:55,579
to help players contextualize it?

1148
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:58,742
Oh, and I guess you drop into a garbage chute too, duh.

1149
01:14:59,703 --> 01:15:01,425
And what's sort of your thought process behind that?

1150
01:15:01,505 --> 01:15:02,926
I know you didn't directly work on this level,

1151
01:15:02,986 --> 01:15:06,209
but I'm sure you were, saw some of it.

1152
01:15:06,229 --> 01:15:09,272
I mean, before you sit down, hopefully,

1153
01:15:11,063 --> 01:15:14,626
before you sit down to even do your paper map of the level at the very beginning,

1154
01:15:14,686 --> 01:15:17,548
you understand the area that the level will be in,

1155
01:15:17,808 --> 01:15:22,532
so that you understand the sorts of architecture that you can use to direct the player.

1156
01:15:23,632 --> 01:15:26,855
We absolutely knew that this was going to be a detention area.

1157
01:15:28,016 --> 01:15:34,461
I do remember some discussion about whether it was cool to actually go down the garbage chute,

1158
01:15:35,461 --> 01:15:37,763
but, you know, it wasn't.

1159
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:43,752
The reality was, the conversation was about,

1160
01:15:44,573 --> 01:15:47,514
is it cooler to be able to actually experience that?

1161
01:15:48,875 --> 01:15:52,857
Or is it more tropey and maybe would make people feel like,

1162
01:15:52,957 --> 01:15:54,217
oh yeah, here's another garbage chute.

1163
01:15:54,918 --> 01:15:57,999
And we made the guess that it would be cooler

1164
01:15:58,039 --> 01:15:58,820
to be able to experience that.

1165
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:01,541
And it was absolutely borne out in playtesting, right?

1166
01:16:01,581 --> 01:16:05,703
But finally getting to do what Han and Luke and Leia do

1167
01:16:05,763 --> 01:16:06,863
at the beginning of New Hope.

1168
01:16:07,338 --> 01:16:09,419
Yeah, yeah, everybody wants to do that, right?

1169
01:16:09,439 --> 01:16:12,701
We were all, we were all eight when that was,

1170
01:16:12,861 --> 01:16:13,762
oh yeah, no, right,

1171
01:16:13,842 --> 01:16:15,903
and now here the real adventure begins, so.

1172
01:16:16,103 --> 01:16:20,866
Yeah, it's where the movie becomes a creature feature

1173
01:16:20,986 --> 01:16:23,087
and not just a running gun.

1174
01:16:23,468 --> 01:16:23,668
Right.

1175
01:16:24,209 --> 01:16:29,313
In terms of how you navigate that stuff generally, like when you're working with a known IP,

1176
01:16:29,453 --> 01:16:36,579
the more recognizable your areas can be, the more players who know those IPs are going to be able

1177
01:16:36,599 --> 01:16:40,222
to navigate your level design, again, your architectural, you know, they'll be able to

1178
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:47,568
make sense of your architecture without being super confused by it. If this room didn't have

1179
01:16:47,608 --> 01:16:53,673
that great big open to space window out there so that it reads as a hangar.

1180
01:16:54,277 --> 01:16:59,618
you wouldn't know where to look for the guns in case an enemy ship comes in, etc.

1181
01:16:59,918 --> 01:17:04,819
So all of that, all of those contextual clues are things you can draw off of in a known IP,

1182
01:17:04,859 --> 01:17:08,579
and especially if you're talking about an IP that's likely to have fans playing the game

1183
01:17:08,619 --> 01:17:13,180
because they saw the movie, watched the TV show, read the book, whatever, and they already have

1184
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:20,542
innate knowledge about the function of a space. That's everything you want. That's just gravy

1185
01:17:20,602 --> 01:17:23,922
where your players get to walk into a space and feel clever.

1186
01:17:24,635 --> 01:17:27,676
in a way that you would have to work really hard for otherwise.

1187
01:17:27,776 --> 01:17:31,718
I really appreciate the hangar example and another point is because it's a big wall of

1188
01:17:31,738 --> 01:17:35,639
space, even if you're not a Star Wars aficionado and you're just here because you like a good

1189
01:17:35,699 --> 01:17:38,700
Xbox shooter, it's a wall, right?

1190
01:17:38,881 --> 01:17:39,821
It's just a wall.

1191
01:17:39,861 --> 01:17:43,582
If you walk up to it, you're not going to get sucked down into the vacuum or the force

1192
01:17:43,683 --> 01:17:45,303
field won't go down.

1193
01:17:45,323 --> 01:17:47,464
Careful, she might do that later.

1194
01:17:52,422 --> 01:17:57,786
Also, this level I'm playing now, this is my absolute favorite portion of the speedrun.

1195
01:17:58,327 --> 01:18:03,411
And it's not even that fast, it's just really nice to just sit through because it's so optimized.

1196
01:18:04,412 --> 01:18:10,417
But something that just happened there that I have no idea why it happens, when you go

1197
01:18:10,457 --> 01:18:16,702
down that little ramp into that little chute, for some reason your squad will always shift

1198
01:18:17,202 --> 01:18:19,244
into search and destroy.

1199
01:18:20,932 --> 01:18:23,173
for some reason, and I have no idea why.

1200
01:18:24,354 --> 01:18:26,475
I can tell you probably why.

1201
01:18:26,896 --> 01:18:29,937
I'm not 100% sure that I'm right about this,

1202
01:18:30,038 --> 01:18:31,639
but I'm pretty sure I'm right.

1203
01:18:33,220 --> 01:18:35,661
One of the earlier you asked,

1204
01:18:36,442 --> 01:18:40,004
why, what were some of the pivots

1205
01:18:40,044 --> 01:18:41,805
that you ended up making when you made the game?

1206
01:18:42,586 --> 01:18:44,066
And putting the squad,

1207
01:18:44,086 --> 01:18:46,608
defaulting the squad into Search and Destroy

1208
01:18:46,628 --> 01:18:47,128
was one of them.

1209
01:18:47,633 --> 01:18:52,017
We had a playtest where we had pretty much everything working, pretty much all the levels put together.

1210
01:18:53,339 --> 01:18:57,763
You know, there was polish and stuff to do, but we understood what the game was generally.

1211
01:18:57,783 --> 01:19:04,729
We had a playtest, and we had a team playthrough, and some of the feedback that we got that was pretty concerning at the time was,

1212
01:19:04,829 --> 01:19:10,494
it doesn't really feel like a squad game. Like, I can hear them, but I never see them.

1213
01:19:10,825 --> 01:19:12,846
and I don't really feel like I'm part of a squad.

1214
01:19:13,726 --> 01:19:18,408
And the directors, they would, maybe not every milestone,

1215
01:19:18,428 --> 01:19:20,769
but periodically they would do a sort of a half day off site

1216
01:19:20,789 --> 01:19:22,470
where they'd take feedback like that

1217
01:19:22,530 --> 01:19:24,171
and they'd really think about it and hash it out

1218
01:19:24,231 --> 01:19:25,872
and come back and like, okay, here's the plan.

1219
01:19:26,812 --> 01:19:28,353
They took that feedback away.

1220
01:19:28,393 --> 01:19:29,273
They came back and they said,

1221
01:19:29,634 --> 01:19:31,294
we think we have the right answer.

1222
01:19:31,314 --> 01:19:33,275
We think the plan is to just,

1223
01:19:34,236 --> 01:19:37,477
basically every time you move into a new section of the game,

1224
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:40,981
to default to search and destroy, so that they'll run in front of you,

1225
01:19:41,261 --> 01:19:44,742
you see your squad do stuff, you remember they're there, you remember to put them on

1226
01:19:44,762 --> 01:19:48,124
the maneuvers, etc. and it worked beautifully. It was an

1227
01:19:48,164 --> 01:19:52,165
incredibly simple code change, and we had been discussing some very

1228
01:19:52,265 --> 01:19:55,686
complicated solutions, but it really did the trick in terms of

1229
01:19:55,766 --> 01:19:58,848
reminding you you're in a squad, showing you what your squad can do,

1230
01:19:59,188 --> 01:20:03,349
putting you in context of what they're going to do. This is my favorite level,

1231
01:20:03,369 --> 01:20:06,290
this map level, this section is my favorite section of the game.

1232
01:20:07,307 --> 01:20:12,849
Yeah, so the reason why this is my favorite is because you pop a uh one of the mines on one of

1233
01:20:12,869 --> 01:20:17,531
these things here over there so at the moment that the normal droids come out of there they um

1234
01:20:18,371 --> 01:20:24,173
they blow up all four of those and immediately kill their own drop pod. You position these guys

1235
01:20:24,233 --> 01:20:29,756
here so they're just in as far away as they can be and then you put someone else right there so

1236
01:20:30,056 --> 01:20:31,316
that they're right next to the

1237
01:20:32,757 --> 01:20:37,401
the force field power generator so at the moment it's available you can just

1238
01:20:37,461 --> 01:20:40,403
tell him to blow it up and then he'll just be right next to it.

1239
01:20:41,064 --> 01:20:44,326
Yeah, that's playing like the level designer, like absolutely.

1240
01:20:44,786 --> 01:20:47,508
It's so nice and choreographed.

1241
01:20:48,409 --> 01:20:51,251
But it's funny, that's my favorite section of the game as well but for

1242
01:20:51,291 --> 01:20:54,374
totally different reasons. I love the fact that I have to plate spin

1243
01:20:54,394 --> 01:20:57,816
for what it feels like forever and just not

1244
01:20:57,896 --> 01:21:00,538
mess even one thing up in order to get through it.

1245
01:21:00,558 --> 01:21:02,500
That was a boss by the way, he was so hard.

1246
01:21:03,847 --> 01:21:09,431
little environmental storytelling is running away. I love how this is the part of the game where you

1247
01:21:09,451 --> 01:21:12,213
start to notice like there's actually like when you're in those hallways there's like these lines

1248
01:21:12,273 --> 01:21:16,756
at the top of the camera um because they're right above the character head that like leads you through

1249
01:21:16,796 --> 01:21:22,139
the space um and they just feel they feel like almost like they're yanking you forward uh there's

1250
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:25,181
such an interesting like psychological like if you're watching when you're watching someone else

1251
01:21:25,201 --> 01:21:28,883
play this it'll be real and not playing it yourself you realize that there's psychological

1252
01:21:28,923 --> 01:21:30,965
things that pull people around um yeah

1253
01:21:31,354 --> 01:21:34,015
your brain factors onto even if you aren't consciously grabbing onto it.

1254
01:21:35,136 --> 01:21:43,140
Yeah. I wonder if it'll be relevant. I want to chat a little bit about

1255
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:45,962
way back there you turned right and you saw

1256
01:21:45,982 --> 01:21:52,706
a dead Jedi with a lightsaber. One of the things that reminded me

1257
01:21:52,766 --> 01:21:53,486
of is that

1258
01:21:57,241 --> 01:22:02,144
job description or when they put up a job rep for a new level designer at LucasArts,

1259
01:22:02,224 --> 01:22:06,987
part of the job description was always, do you know why players always turn right instead of left?

1260
01:22:08,347 --> 01:22:13,750
It was a very specific, and I honestly don't know if it's true, but I still believe it because it

1261
01:22:13,790 --> 01:22:19,774
was just, it is known amongst the level designers at LucasArts that people always turn right instead

1262
01:22:19,794 --> 01:22:23,116
of left, and then, and so you have to put an end of a hallway there so that they know.

1263
01:22:23,575 --> 01:22:27,560
to hang a left which is why we put that there we knew everybody would see it because that you know

1264
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:33,186
conventional wisdom was they're going to turn right oh that's so fascinating uh because uh a

1265
01:22:33,306 --> 01:22:35,468
because um i was talking with um

1266
01:22:37,172 --> 01:22:46,540
Bill Gardner of 2K a while back about T-sections in level design and his thoughts about those.

1267
01:22:47,741 --> 01:22:49,783
I know that when I turn right as a player I'm often like,

1268
01:22:49,883 --> 01:22:51,724
okay, well that's the way forward, I need to look for the goodies.

1269
01:22:52,024 --> 01:22:57,709
But I feel like that might just be like a follow-up reaction to what you were designing at the time,

1270
01:22:58,170 --> 01:23:02,033
which is a response to what players were doing before goodies were being placed in that sense.

1271
01:23:03,117 --> 01:23:10,419
It's certainly possible. I mean, you put a goodie at the end of a thing so a player knows that there's nothing else there, right?

1272
01:23:11,139 --> 01:23:15,061
It's not necessarily to make sure they have enough ammo, though. You do have to do that as well.

1273
01:23:15,961 --> 01:23:19,182
So I don't know where that loop is. It's a little bit of a chicken and egg question.

1274
01:23:19,202 --> 01:23:24,004
Do players turn right because they know there are goodies there, or do we put goodies there because we know players are going to turn right?

1275
01:23:24,464 --> 01:23:27,545
Yeah. Oh, my brain just broke a little. Oh my god, that's like...

1276
01:23:28,285 --> 01:23:29,325
It's like you said.

1277
01:23:29,525 --> 01:23:32,146
It's like on the Wish Came First, chicken or the egg.

1278
01:23:32,606 --> 01:23:32,827
Yeah.

1279
01:23:34,460 --> 01:23:38,461
It's like you said, secrets of the universe.

1280
01:23:38,501 --> 01:23:40,341
No, Dave was not saying yesterday secrets of the universe.

1281
01:23:40,381 --> 01:23:41,581
You were saying from the looking glass.

1282
01:23:42,862 --> 01:23:45,842
If we're going game development terms, I guess we've crossed the magic circle.

1283
01:23:47,283 --> 01:23:48,603
Good old turret hack coming up again.

1284
01:23:50,443 --> 01:23:51,304
Chad is also...

1285
01:23:52,364 --> 01:23:55,585
Oh my goodness, yeah. Dave has an interesting consideration question.

1286
01:23:55,945 --> 01:23:59,886
Is it true in the UK and Australia where turning left on the car is easier than turning right?

1287
01:23:59,906 --> 01:24:01,466
I don't know if anyone's from the UK or Australia.

1288
01:24:02,025 --> 01:24:08,512
I don't think we can adequately answer that, but I guess, I wonder if that has something to do with our perceptions of left and right across different countries.

1289
01:24:09,673 --> 01:24:14,618
Yeah, I don't know the answer to that, but it would be interesting. I wonder if you could get a grant for that study.

1290
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:25,670
Funny enough, this tank that's coming up right now, popping up on the elevator, I have a little Lego, I have a Lego one of those down there on my left, one of the, I think it's the first one they released from the Revenge of the Sith quite a lot.

1291
01:24:26,437 --> 01:24:29,960
It's missing a few pieces and it got beat up in the moves that we had to do.

1292
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:34,004
But this game is just such a visual feast for like,

1293
01:24:34,024 --> 01:24:40,229
I remember when this was my obsession, when these things were what I loved thinking about.

1294
01:24:41,510 --> 01:24:41,871
Yeah.

1295
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:46,655
Is this the only full-size... I don't know if this is the only one in the game.

1296
01:24:48,096 --> 01:24:50,358
I don't remember. You might be able to see them from a distance.

1297
01:24:51,739 --> 01:24:52,660
Sheep and maybe...

1298
01:24:53,385 --> 01:24:57,067
I know that on Kashyyyk you see like the Torrent fighters for the first time.

1299
01:24:57,087 --> 01:25:01,988
It's so interesting to see them rendered because they show up in the Clone Wars TV show so

1300
01:25:02,008 --> 01:25:02,408
much now.

1301
01:25:03,429 --> 01:25:05,930
Like, you know, there's like that, the way they look there is burning my brain.

1302
01:25:06,010 --> 01:25:07,590
It's funny to see the same silhouette.

1303
01:25:09,291 --> 01:25:14,673
But just, you know, like rendered in UE2 as opposed to the animation of Clone Wars.

1304
01:25:15,923 --> 01:25:17,744
Like all the little details like that where it's like,

1305
01:25:17,824 --> 01:25:19,765
oh, we made this one asset for this one scene,

1306
01:25:20,265 --> 01:25:21,046
and it looks this way,

1307
01:25:21,086 --> 01:25:23,147
and it clearly looks like the thing that's in the movie.

1308
01:25:24,168 --> 01:25:25,589
I actually now don't even remember.

1309
01:25:26,549 --> 01:25:27,890
So I know this game would have shipped right,

1310
01:25:27,950 --> 01:25:29,271
you know, in between the two movies.

1311
01:25:30,492 --> 01:25:32,493
And now I'm just having a Star Wars nerd out moment.

1312
01:25:32,573 --> 01:25:35,314
I don't remember if the Torrents were in episode two,

1313
01:25:35,615 --> 01:25:37,336
but I do remember that they were in the

1314
01:25:37,836 --> 01:25:40,037
first animated TV series that aired on Cartoon Network

1315
01:25:40,057 --> 01:25:41,818
with like the little short micro episodes.

1316
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:45,134
So now I'm just having a whole bunch of like, wait, when was this?

1317
01:25:45,174 --> 01:25:45,695
When was this show?

1318
01:25:45,735 --> 01:25:46,316
When was this show?

1319
01:25:47,577 --> 01:25:51,082
Yeah, I can't go that deep into that nerd rabbit hole.

1320
01:25:51,142 --> 01:25:51,743
I'm sorry.

1321
01:25:52,183 --> 01:25:52,864
It's okay.

1322
01:25:53,625 --> 01:25:54,987
I'm in the rabbit hole by myself.

1323
01:25:55,508 --> 01:25:56,829
Yeah, sometimes you end up there.

1324
01:26:00,952 --> 01:26:04,334
Oh, JD4, were there any elements in the level design ladder,

1325
01:26:04,354 --> 01:26:06,596
or excuse me, were there any elements in the level design,

1326
01:26:06,656 --> 01:26:09,598
like the ladder on the tank where you had to extrapolate from the cannon,

1327
01:26:10,419 --> 01:26:14,182
or from what Lucasfilm handed you, to realize it in the game world?

1328
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:17,764
Because that ladder is definitely, he's right, the ladder that you climb up into the tank

1329
01:26:17,824 --> 01:26:19,465
is definitely like a, oh, of course there'd be a ladder.

1330
01:26:19,485 --> 01:26:20,226
Right.

1331
01:26:20,286 --> 01:26:22,087
But it's not something that I think is shown elsewhere.

1332
01:26:22,848 --> 01:26:23,228
I mean, yes.

1333
01:26:26,488 --> 01:26:30,030
I hate to generalize so much, but in some ways that's what level design is, right?

1334
01:26:30,330 --> 01:26:36,252
Here's a room with a function, now let's put a fight in that room, and how do we use the

1335
01:26:36,413 --> 01:26:39,674
function of the room to give coherence to the fight, right?

1336
01:26:40,454 --> 01:26:42,175
Here's an object with a function, etc.

1337
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:52,660
The one that I think, in my memory, was the one that really...

1338
01:26:55,077 --> 01:26:58,018
I had to think about a lot was the elevators in Kashyyyk.

1339
01:26:59,139 --> 01:27:01,720
It seemed really weird to me that Wookiees would need elevators,

1340
01:27:02,141 --> 01:27:05,562
but we're not Wookiees, and we have to get up and down some way, right?

1341
01:27:06,703 --> 01:27:12,386
And it didn't necessarily feel like it was going to be a great choice to have a huge amount of shoe leather

1342
01:27:13,307 --> 01:27:14,527
in order to just go up.

1343
01:27:16,628 --> 01:27:18,649
By shoe leather, you mean like ramps and stairways?

1344
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:21,991
Well, yeah, just a lot of walking and running, right?

1345
01:27:22,211 --> 01:27:22,411
Yeah.

1346
01:27:22,472 --> 01:27:23,032
Shoe leather is...

1347
01:27:24,194 --> 01:27:29,635
Like, unless you can fill it with action, nobody wants to walk forever, right?

1348
01:27:29,655 --> 01:27:30,236
Yeah.

1349
01:27:31,056 --> 01:27:36,317
And so we ended up with elevators, and it works out fine, and they actually work as

1350
01:27:36,357 --> 01:27:39,058
a pretty nice progress bar through that section of the game.

1351
01:27:39,138 --> 01:27:42,519
Okay, going up another elevator, going up another elevator, ooh, I'm going up another

1352
01:27:42,539 --> 01:27:42,999
level.

1353
01:27:44,479 --> 01:27:49,860
But initially, I remember being convinced that wasn't going to work.

1354
01:27:51,214 --> 01:27:58,500
Yeah. Bradley Ellis would like to know, when you designed levels, what was your philosophy for designing cover? That's a great question, and I love it.

1355
01:28:00,742 --> 01:28:08,328
Me personally, it was give the player enough agency that they can do what they want to do with their squad, right?

1356
01:28:08,488 --> 01:28:13,312
We had these mechanics where you could essentially have three extra guns going at once.

1357
01:28:13,867 --> 01:28:16,669
And I didn't just want to have, well, here's three cover spots

1358
01:28:17,209 --> 01:28:20,091
where you can put your three squad members,

1359
01:28:20,151 --> 01:28:20,892
and that'll help you.

1360
01:28:20,932 --> 01:28:23,153
I wanted players to be able to really choose

1361
01:28:23,193 --> 01:28:25,815
how they were going to take on different challenges.

1362
01:28:28,297 --> 01:28:32,219
That was partly because I had the advantage

1363
01:28:32,279 --> 01:28:38,464
of getting to play nearly complete levels before I even

1364
01:28:38,524 --> 01:28:40,505
started making mine, because I came onto the team.

1365
01:28:41,009 --> 01:28:44,591
I wasn't on the team during pre-production, I came on as production started.

1366
01:28:46,532 --> 01:28:55,516
In terms of the player being able to use cover, I at the time tended to be a real run-and-gun

1367
01:28:55,916 --> 01:29:04,299
player where basically my play pattern was find all the ammo and use all the heal stations.

1368
01:29:04,860 --> 01:29:06,020
So I probably actually...

1369
01:29:06,857 --> 01:29:12,004
In terms of philosophy, probably my philosophy was don't put enough cover in to keep people moving.

1370
01:29:13,547 --> 01:29:17,973
That may also, that feels like sort of a remnant. Games changed a lot in this time. Cover got a lot more important

1371
01:29:18,794 --> 01:29:21,337
compared to the Doom days where cover was

1372
01:29:21,931 --> 01:29:29,038
cover? Doom? What? No, you- you- it's rip and tear, baby. Um, we're coming up on Kashyyyk,

1373
01:29:29,418 --> 01:29:33,602
uh, for folks in chat, just a heads up. We still have a little bit of time left in the run, but

1374
01:29:33,622 --> 01:29:38,727
we will be coming towards the end. I suggest start asking questions. Um, uh, Harley, when we talked

1375
01:29:38,787 --> 01:29:44,252
before, uh, the show, you- you- you told us that Kashyyyk, uh, the camp that's coming up and then

1376
01:29:44,312 --> 01:29:46,634
the- the tree at the end are the areas you built by hand.

1377
01:29:47,252 --> 01:29:52,355
So feel free to just go in and start telling stories if there's anything you want to tell us about making this.

1378
01:29:52,375 --> 01:29:56,938
Sure. Getting this barbeque creature was a major coup for me.

1379
01:29:56,978 --> 01:30:05,463
I really wanted to show that Trandoshan's relaxing as a way of letting you walk into this space and be relaxed,

1380
01:30:05,563 --> 01:30:09,165
so that we could do a little bit of ramping up the excitement.

1381
01:30:09,866 --> 01:30:15,389
But it was late, and there really wasn't a lot of budget or scope for Trandoshan food.

1382
01:30:17,115 --> 01:30:21,701
But somebody did me a huge favor and made me that barbecued lizard creature,

1383
01:30:21,721 --> 01:30:23,804
for which I will forever be grateful.

1384
01:30:24,364 --> 01:30:26,707
I always think about that when I'm interviewing devs about games,

1385
01:30:26,727 --> 01:30:31,172
because I'm always keeping an eye on it now after hearing a story from TJ Fixman about Insomniac,

1386
01:30:31,693 --> 01:30:34,216
about how something that, if you think about it like a physical object,

1387
01:30:34,296 --> 01:30:35,438
yeah, sure, we could probably like...

1388
01:30:36,631 --> 01:30:40,353
make a fake Trandoshan creep, you know, like just a bit of barbecue or something, like some gross meat.

1389
01:30:40,593 --> 01:30:42,113
Like, yeah, we can whip that up in 30 minutes.

1390
01:30:42,734 --> 01:30:47,176
In video games, in ARK, you want me to do what? From one thing? From how much?

1391
01:30:47,656 --> 01:30:49,237
Yeah.

1392
01:30:49,297 --> 01:30:49,557
Yep.

1393
01:30:50,877 --> 01:31:00,021
That was a- that was- that was a carefully crafted ambush, which you basically skipped most of, as you can see.

1394
01:31:02,883 --> 01:31:04,884
Oh, that's why I got so excited when I watched...

1395
01:31:05,345 --> 01:31:06,865
I'm just...

1396
01:31:06,985 --> 01:31:10,147
What this run looks like on Kashyyyk is so different from the...

1397
01:31:10,627 --> 01:31:13,268
Kashyyyk is the most, uh...

1398
01:31:13,888 --> 01:31:17,570
We don't care about your effort, we want to go fast level.

1399
01:31:18,751 --> 01:31:22,773
I keep wondering why that is under the hood, like, why does the gunship,

1400
01:31:22,973 --> 01:31:25,594
you know, why does the capital ship have such linear sections versus...

1401
01:31:26,034 --> 01:31:28,815
Kashyyyk has open ones, but I don't want to speculate, uh...

1402
01:31:28,935 --> 01:31:30,176
I probably won't do that.

1403
01:31:30,444 --> 01:31:34,988
I'm kind of thinking it's mostly just due to the open nature of it all.

1404
01:31:35,088 --> 01:31:43,996
The ship is kind of closed in so there's nothing to really climb on while this has a lot of

1405
01:31:44,056 --> 01:31:47,619
hills that you can climb and stuff like that.

1406
01:31:47,639 --> 01:31:53,044
Yeah, we definitely wanted to change the feel so that you felt like you were outside and

1407
01:31:53,384 --> 01:31:56,967
so some of that stuff comes from needing to be able to do that for sure.

1408
01:32:00,722 --> 01:32:02,823
That's one of those explosions that hurts you.

1409
01:32:03,404 --> 01:32:04,705
I wasn't back far enough.

1410
01:32:04,925 --> 01:32:08,188
Oh yeah, I love how giant the Wookiees are in this game.

1411
01:32:09,169 --> 01:32:09,589
Yeah.

1412
01:32:10,170 --> 01:32:10,870
They look like bodybuilders.

1413
01:32:10,890 --> 01:32:12,732
You don't get to stand next to a Wookiee very often.

1414
01:32:13,132 --> 01:32:14,253
You want to make it count, right?

1415
01:32:15,267 --> 01:32:20,791
Hey, go to Galaxy's Edge when it's safe to again, and you can do that there because Chewy won't drown.

1416
01:32:20,991 --> 01:32:26,196
Oh yeah, so something fun I'm going to do in this next level, for the longest time they could figure out how to get the...

1417
01:32:26,776 --> 01:32:30,619
Press the walk button to make the zip line stop moving you to work on this level.

1418
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:34,062
But once this... Oh, dude, get off me.

1419
01:32:34,142 --> 01:32:38,105
Once this... Once the quicksave quickload thing was found...

1420
01:32:38,145 --> 01:32:39,046
They finally found the way.

1421
01:32:45,551 --> 01:32:47,092
And now you can just kinda... pop.

1422
01:32:48,132 --> 01:32:52,014
And you know, through this level you kinda go all the way around rescuing Wookiees from...

1423
01:32:53,154 --> 01:32:53,694
from their...

1424
01:32:55,155 --> 01:32:56,815
their cages.

1425
01:32:56,855 --> 01:32:58,596
You just, uh... walk through.

1426
01:32:59,957 --> 01:33:00,277
Yeah.

1427
01:33:01,137 --> 01:33:03,538
This is my carefully, carefully crafted...

1428
01:33:03,878 --> 01:33:04,218
uh, BSP.

1429
01:33:04,258 --> 01:33:04,338
Wow.

1430
01:33:09,828 --> 01:33:14,652
Well, at least you get to see that the entire level is actually spatially coherent, which

1431
01:33:14,712 --> 01:33:19,175
is a little bit rare, and that it all fits in the space that it's supposed to fit in,

1432
01:33:19,596 --> 01:33:20,456
in real space.

1433
01:33:21,117 --> 01:33:22,238
I'm gonna say it cheerfully.

1434
01:33:22,558 --> 01:33:25,260
This is also another fun thing.

1435
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:31,586
I'm actually gonna run through this in the intended way, just to give viewers at least

1436
01:33:31,806 --> 01:33:34,528
a perspective for how much this is skipping.

1437
01:33:35,980 --> 01:33:37,980
So, oh yeah, so we get to see, yeah.

1438
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:40,041
Thank you, thank you, it's really nice of you.

1439
01:33:40,421 --> 01:33:42,381
I actually, absolutely, oh, that's so close.

1440
01:33:42,682 --> 01:33:44,042
I absolutely love the noises

1441
01:33:44,082 --> 01:33:45,542
that the Wookiees make in the sound.

1442
01:33:45,582 --> 01:33:47,223
They always sound so sad.

1443
01:33:47,243 --> 01:33:51,824
They sound like, oh, why is this happening?

1444
01:33:51,884 --> 01:33:53,084
I was having a good morning.

1445
01:33:54,705 --> 01:33:57,326
So here, I'm gonna quick save.

1446
01:33:57,586 --> 01:33:59,506
What you're supposed to do is just come to this window,

1447
01:34:00,046 --> 01:34:01,867
see Grievous, and then you blow this up.

1448
01:34:06,024 --> 01:34:15,187
been spotted get down there or general kenobi hello there the amount of time that i spent making sure

1449
01:34:15,227 --> 01:34:21,709
that you had to see grievous before you could continue on you would just be flabbergasted

1450
01:34:22,129 --> 01:34:27,771
but yeah so so you do that you come through here you know there's that guy there so you

1451
01:34:27,791 --> 01:34:32,093
see tar fall and you know you you blow this up where are they taking him

1452
01:34:34,088 --> 01:34:36,450
I can't get over the Wookiee sounds, they just...

1453
01:34:37,131 --> 01:34:38,953
They sound in such distress.

1454
01:34:40,856 --> 01:34:41,837
Sounds so sad.

1455
01:34:41,857 --> 01:34:44,560
They're being, uh...

1456
01:34:45,421 --> 01:34:49,405
I mean, I wish the sound... I know, um, I remember Brett got the sound team on, uh...

1457
01:34:49,946 --> 01:34:52,449
Some of the sound folks on his run, and, uh...

1458
01:34:52,863 --> 01:34:54,084
they were talking about some of their work.

1459
01:34:54,124 --> 01:34:56,564
And I'd love to know which of these were pulled

1460
01:34:56,604 --> 01:34:59,745
from the LucasArchives, from Ben Bird's work,

1461
01:34:59,965 --> 01:35:02,205
and which of these were cooked up or inspired by it.

1462
01:35:02,225 --> 01:35:04,466
Because it's always interesting to mix.

1463
01:35:04,506 --> 01:35:05,306
So you do all that.

1464
01:35:06,386 --> 01:35:12,127
But what you do for the run is you do not look at Grievous.

1465
01:35:12,627 --> 01:35:14,428
It is very bad to look at Grievous.

1466
01:35:14,528 --> 01:35:15,488
Don't look at Grievous.

1467
01:35:15,528 --> 01:35:16,368
Don't scare Grievous.

1468
01:35:17,008 --> 01:35:18,268
Do not look at Grievous.

1469
01:35:18,428 --> 01:35:18,988
Just kidding.

1470
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:20,641
Jump over here.

1471
01:35:21,241 --> 01:35:23,503
Don't verify Grievous' presence on Kishi.

1472
01:35:24,364 --> 01:35:24,904
Yeah.

1473
01:35:25,324 --> 01:35:26,965
You acknowledge Tardhole exists.

1474
01:35:27,526 --> 01:35:28,367
You walk back.

1475
01:35:30,088 --> 01:35:30,528
You come through.

1476
01:35:30,788 --> 01:35:32,369
Then you look at Grievous.

1477
01:35:34,531 --> 01:35:39,695
Yes, of course you do, because it's the cutscene of Grievous.

1478
01:35:39,775 --> 01:35:41,776
You tap that on there.

1479
01:35:41,796 --> 01:35:42,497
You throw that.

1480
01:35:42,517 --> 01:35:45,139
And then...

1481
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:49,042
And then these guys just stand here and let you spam them.

1482
01:35:51,412 --> 01:35:57,995
Not usually. You have to use the shock grenade to stun them.

1483
01:35:58,956 --> 01:36:04,358
Which is interesting because the shock grenade, it's also damaging you, right? Or it's supposed to be so you don't want to stand by it?

1484
01:36:05,118 --> 01:36:09,921
It is, but it's pretty insignificant compared to the effects that it gives.

1485
01:36:10,321 --> 01:36:15,403
Just this thinking of how I would have played this, I don't stand by the grenades I throw where I try not to.

1486
01:36:15,703 --> 01:36:17,984
I mean, I do in Apex Legends, who am I kidding? I blow myself up.

1487
01:36:21,208 --> 01:36:25,892
But runners and other fast- oh god, the fighter has no collision.

1488
01:36:25,912 --> 01:36:27,333
It actually does.

1489
01:36:27,853 --> 01:36:31,817
Oh, right here in the center, yeah.

1490
01:36:33,638 --> 01:36:34,419
It's fascinating.

1491
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:40,804
I can verify, I'm pretty sure that's an honest hack that shipped in the game, having been

1492
01:36:40,825 --> 01:36:42,946
the one who tried to set that up to be bulletproof.

1493
01:36:43,627 --> 01:36:43,827
Yeah.

1494
01:36:43,847 --> 01:36:44,287
It was.

1495
01:36:44,628 --> 01:36:44,848
Yeah.

1496
01:36:45,569 --> 01:36:47,490
These scavenger droids are the worst to deal with.

1497
01:36:48,210 --> 01:36:54,296
Now this section was not my level. I did help a little bit with bug fixing. I don't think I helped with optimization at all.

1498
01:36:54,957 --> 01:36:55,397
Gotcha.

1499
01:36:55,557 --> 01:37:02,084
So there are parts where I'm like, yeah, I know this part really, really well because I ended up, you know, painstakingly doing a thing.

1500
01:37:02,845 --> 01:37:04,886
Oh, now I feel bad.

1501
01:37:05,807 --> 01:37:11,313
But not most of it. Most of it, I'm just gonna be able to enjoy it without the...

1502
01:37:13,810 --> 01:37:15,871
without the... no, don't feel bad, right?

1503
01:37:15,891 --> 01:37:18,894
Like, we do this because we want people to have fun,

1504
01:37:18,994 --> 01:37:21,096
and fun means different things to different people.

1505
01:37:21,296 --> 01:37:21,796
It's all good.

1506
01:37:24,138 --> 01:37:26,540
Um, JD Ford in chat, uh, says,

1507
01:37:26,580 --> 01:37:28,502
watching someone just slip through your meticulous design

1508
01:37:28,522 --> 01:37:31,324
must be equally frustrating and morbidly fascinating.

1509
01:37:31,784 --> 01:37:34,226
I mean, I just want to go back in time and fix it.

1510
01:37:34,266 --> 01:37:34,587
That's all.

1511
01:37:39,459 --> 01:37:41,380
I do. Oh, God. Yeah.

1512
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:44,301
Gabe wants to know if you can kill Grievous with that pack.

1513
01:37:45,081 --> 01:37:48,182
No, you Grievous does not have a health bar or anything like that.

1514
01:37:48,862 --> 01:37:53,143
Yeah, Grievous is just a he's he's the moving equivalent of a prop.

1515
01:37:53,643 --> 01:37:55,804
That's right. Hey, that's true in real life, too.

1516
01:37:56,004 --> 01:38:00,565
In the movies. Grievous is is horribly pathetic

1517
01:38:00,665 --> 01:38:04,787
in the movies and the Clone Wars compared to his 2D Clone Wars variant.

1518
01:38:05,247 --> 01:38:06,407
Yeah, I remember.

1519
01:38:08,277 --> 01:38:11,740
I believe 2D Clone Wars was out about the same time as this.

1520
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:12,500
Oh, hello, Army.

1521
01:38:13,861 --> 01:38:14,382
Good to meet you.

1522
01:38:15,943 --> 01:38:20,066
Was out at about the same time as this.

1523
01:38:20,406 --> 01:38:23,168
And so seeing Grievous was like, oh, shoot, it's that guy.

1524
01:38:23,308 --> 01:38:25,810
Oh, man, we better be careful around him.

1525
01:38:26,971 --> 01:38:31,554
And then he came out for three in the, oh, that's going to hurt.

1526
01:38:33,135 --> 01:38:35,297
For three in the Clone Wars.

1527
01:38:37,054 --> 01:38:40,596
Everyone's just like, he's not as scary as he's supposed to be.

1528
01:38:40,616 --> 01:38:43,118
Okay, I need to deal with these guys.

1529
01:38:43,658 --> 01:38:44,179
Gotcha.

1530
01:38:44,679 --> 01:38:47,501
Setting up the Grievous Guards was one of the most fun things

1531
01:38:47,561 --> 01:38:48,922
for me as a level designer.

1532
01:38:50,943 --> 01:38:51,984
They were just so fun.

1533
01:38:52,084 --> 01:38:52,744
They were unlike,

1534
01:38:53,004 --> 01:38:55,106
they operated unlike any other level in the game.

1535
01:38:56,527 --> 01:38:59,409
And for me, that stuff is always really interesting, right?

1536
01:38:59,649 --> 01:39:03,491
Take a new ingredient and try to blend it in

1537
01:39:03,511 --> 01:39:05,953
a dish that's already being served as it were.

1538
01:39:07,022 --> 01:39:12,306
The Magna Guards are such an interesting design component because they're not Jedi characters,

1539
01:39:12,386 --> 01:39:18,669
but they use Jedi-ish weapons, but they're droids, so they're melee, but they're melee

1540
01:39:18,829 --> 01:39:24,673
fighters and this is a gun game, so watching different games, like, try to figure out how

1541
01:39:24,693 --> 01:39:25,393
to put them in.

1542
01:39:26,014 --> 01:39:26,434
There we go.

1543
01:39:26,574 --> 01:39:26,914
Oh no.

1544
01:39:27,174 --> 01:39:27,455
Oh no.

1545
01:39:27,475 --> 01:39:28,535
Uh oh.

1546
01:39:29,716 --> 01:39:30,236
Nice.

1547
01:39:30,376 --> 01:39:31,057
We're off the map.

1548
01:39:31,617 --> 01:39:32,778
You have to know where you're going.

1549
01:39:36,946 --> 01:39:39,468
Um, I think sound to navigate.

1550
01:39:40,769 --> 01:39:45,754
No, I'm using this wall here and I, I wasn't hugging it quite as well as I should be.

1551
01:39:46,194 --> 01:39:46,615
Gotcha.

1552
01:39:47,015 --> 01:39:47,435
Here we go.

1553
01:39:48,336 --> 01:39:52,901
Um, uh, Alex Jacobson wants to weigh in with a lot of glitch hunters within speed

1554
01:39:52,921 --> 01:39:55,864
running communities actually have a lot of knowledge about how games work, whether

1555
01:39:55,904 --> 01:40:00,348
it's dev experience, QA experience, and how that's how they find a lot of exploits

1556
01:40:00,428 --> 01:40:00,968
is wondering.

1557
01:40:01,809 --> 01:40:04,832
I wonder if someone forgot to stop this.

1558
01:40:05,052 --> 01:40:06,813
At least that's to Alex's knowledge,

1559
01:40:06,833 --> 01:40:08,174
it's obviously not true for all runners.

1560
01:40:09,395 --> 01:40:10,236
Absolutely, right?

1561
01:40:11,256 --> 01:40:13,458
And even if you haven't worked in the industry,

1562
01:40:13,738 --> 01:40:15,059
once you've found a few of these,

1563
01:40:15,099 --> 01:40:20,103
you start seeing the kinds of ways that we think

1564
01:40:20,943 --> 01:40:22,925
and it opens up new horizons.

1565
01:40:24,598 --> 01:40:36,486
I'm sure this isn't consistent across the discipline, but in my experience, a lot of level designers are super organized thinkers because you have to be able to manage huge amounts of data.

1566
01:40:37,126 --> 01:40:44,851
And you have to be aware at any time of like, what is the player's objective? What tools do they have? You know, what do they know? What do they not know, etc, etc.

1567
01:40:45,211 --> 01:40:49,734
And so that's going to lead you to setting things up in a specific way that people who have.

1568
01:40:50,815 --> 01:40:54,637
uh... who have less of a tendency to organize stuff in that way are going to

1569
01:40:54,657 --> 01:40:55,538
be able to exploit

1570
01:40:56,078 --> 01:41:00,920
you're going to leave holes in the way you've got stuff set up

1571
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:01,881
uh... uh...

1572
01:41:01,921 --> 01:41:02,401
let's see

1573
01:41:03,381 --> 01:41:03,481
uh...

1574
01:41:04,302 --> 01:41:06,363
i'm looking at chat uh... matthew's

1575
01:41:06,443 --> 01:41:08,444
oh no go for it

1576
01:41:08,984 --> 01:41:13,106
so there you saw me do the quick save quick load to be able to skip the zipline portion

1577
01:41:13,506 --> 01:41:14,606
and here i'm actually using the

1578
01:41:15,578 --> 01:41:26,081
I didn't do that right. I'm actually using the game's physics to skip hacking this console here that has the crane move.

1579
01:41:26,101 --> 01:41:31,563
I did that too early.

1580
01:41:31,943 --> 01:41:33,223
So you just shoot this.

1581
01:41:35,364 --> 01:41:37,285
And as they spawn, release it.

1582
01:41:38,785 --> 01:41:39,785
And then it drops it onto him.

1583
01:41:41,628 --> 01:41:45,990
rather than mean to come over here and hack this, which you can still hack this and still

1584
01:41:46,030 --> 01:41:50,491
move the crane despite there being nothing on it anymore.

1585
01:41:50,551 --> 01:41:51,112
Right.

1586
01:41:51,252 --> 01:41:52,812
That's good implementation right there.

1587
01:41:53,953 --> 01:42:00,635
Chad is discussing uh how come the clone advisor was killable um but Grievous was not um uh um

1588
01:42:00,875 --> 01:42:06,077
Kisan Kisan Kian George I don't know if it's Gorge or George.

1589
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:09,983
Keon Gorge says, uh, they think Grievous is different because he's unique in the game

1590
01:42:10,304 --> 01:42:13,586
and there are plenty of clones of health bars and hitboxes elsewhere in the game because they

1591
01:42:13,626 --> 01:42:18,310
obviously interact with, uh, the droids in some combat scenarios. Okay, we're just walking through

1592
01:42:18,330 --> 01:42:23,414
the lab again, I see. That doesn't even save time or anything, it's just fun for messing around.

1593
01:42:25,396 --> 01:42:31,481
This level is what I call a whole W level. A what? A whole W level. You just hold the forward key

1594
01:42:31,521 --> 01:42:31,741
because...

1595
01:42:32,420 --> 01:42:35,421
There's no skips or tricks, just kind of walking through it.

1596
01:42:36,141 --> 01:42:38,602
I hold out the pistol here because it just doesn't use ammo.

1597
01:42:39,442 --> 01:42:40,142
Gotcha, yeah.

1598
01:42:40,242 --> 01:42:44,003
And the most combat I do is against little scavenger droids.

1599
01:42:44,103 --> 01:42:47,464
I guess the pistol also, it uses less camera time,

1600
01:42:47,484 --> 01:42:48,984
so if you're trying to keep an eye on the environment.

1601
01:42:50,244 --> 01:42:52,105
Yeah, I thought at first they did it

1602
01:42:52,125 --> 01:42:54,245
because it makes you move faster, but no.

1603
01:42:54,345 --> 01:42:55,545
I kind of wish that was the case, though.

1604
01:42:55,585 --> 01:42:58,486
I feel like a whole lot more unique movement

1605
01:42:58,506 --> 01:42:59,706
would also come into play sometimes

1606
01:42:59,726 --> 01:43:00,747
with just pulling out the pistol.

1607
01:43:02,908 --> 01:43:04,970
Um, Harley, I don't know if you remember anything about the cell.

1608
01:43:04,990 --> 01:43:07,513
We can jam on like, like the pistol game.

1609
01:43:07,553 --> 01:43:11,057
I remember games from this era were very like, okay, you have your general gun.

1610
01:43:11,317 --> 01:43:15,241
You have your situational guns, uh, that play your, like maybe guns of higher

1611
01:43:15,321 --> 01:43:19,226
skill uses that can then be used more broadly, um, like this game, sniper

1612
01:43:19,486 --> 01:43:20,587
attachment, um,

1613
01:43:21,273 --> 01:43:24,355
But the pistol is always the fallback for when you run out of ammo.

1614
01:43:24,515 --> 01:43:26,876
And that convention has changed a lot.

1615
01:43:27,456 --> 01:43:34,999
But it feels like a leftover thing from Doom where the pistol was just sort of your little backup if you could not find ammo and you needed to do something.

1616
01:43:35,620 --> 01:43:37,500
Yeah, absolutely. In some ways it was.

1617
01:43:38,561 --> 01:43:45,104
It's also worth remembering that this game was a game that was intended to be...

1618
01:43:46,427 --> 01:43:50,270
reaching a Star Wars audience, not necessarily a shooter audience.

1619
01:43:50,650 --> 01:43:54,773
We expected to include shooters among them, but there were a lot of Star Wars fans at the time,

1620
01:43:54,793 --> 01:44:00,718
especially new Star Wars fans that didn't necessarily have a really sophisticated shooter

1621
01:44:02,419 --> 01:44:08,024
skill base. And so we needed to make sure that if Push came to shove and they had

1622
01:44:09,165 --> 01:44:12,487
wasted all their ammo or used it on something...

1623
01:44:12,914 --> 01:44:16,978
that they had a way to try to get to the next ammo drop, to try to get to the next load,

1624
01:44:17,018 --> 01:44:20,040
etc.

1625
01:44:21,321 --> 01:44:27,126
And so, you know, as you do when you're making games, you look at existing games and you

1626
01:44:27,146 --> 01:44:28,508
say, how did they solve that, right?

1627
01:44:29,669 --> 01:44:33,912
We did not think we were going to be able to solve it just with the knife thing coming

1628
01:44:33,972 --> 01:44:37,615
out of your hand, because that's actually a pretty difficult skill in and of itself,

1629
01:44:37,716 --> 01:44:40,398
and there are enemies that it's pretty hard to kill that way.

1630
01:44:41,405 --> 01:44:47,469
as you've proven today, Lister, can kill anything that way if you know how.

1631
01:44:47,529 --> 01:44:51,931
Speaking on something about designing shooter stuff, something I was paying attention to

1632
01:44:52,071 --> 01:44:56,313
on Utsu's run actually weirdly lines up with an experience I have playing Respawn's Apex

1633
01:44:56,353 --> 01:44:56,954
Legends right now.

1634
01:44:56,974 --> 01:44:58,354
I'm just giving awful off to Respawn.

1635
01:44:58,494 --> 01:44:59,515
Oh yeah, this is bad.

1636
01:44:59,575 --> 01:45:00,455
This is something.

1637
01:45:00,575 --> 01:45:02,416
Yeah, you can just climb up here and...

1638
01:45:03,939 --> 01:45:06,199
I don't feel like playing this level today.

1639
01:45:06,219 --> 01:45:07,560
I don't like this one.

1640
01:45:07,660 --> 01:45:11,581
Something is happening where every time I'm about to bring up the very specific question I'm about to ask,

1641
01:45:11,961 --> 01:45:15,402
Usu's just like, okay, let's break everyone's brains visually.

1642
01:45:15,422 --> 01:45:19,443
Yeah, that's a lot of these levels, unfortunately.

1643
01:45:19,483 --> 01:45:23,044
There's just no real time for breaks to make.

1644
01:45:23,924 --> 01:45:26,405
You'll notice I'm leaving them behind a lot here,

1645
01:45:26,505 --> 01:45:30,066
despite there being nothing really that would affect them going forward.

1646
01:45:30,386 --> 01:45:31,827
That's because I need them to be at full health.

1647
01:45:32,067 --> 01:45:33,507
It's very important that they're at full health.

1648
01:45:34,470 --> 01:45:37,270
Aha! Fascinating. Interesting.

1649
01:45:37,310 --> 01:45:40,211
For the upcoming bridge section that they keep bringing up.

1650
01:45:41,731 --> 01:45:44,652
Yep, that bridge section is the hardest in the game, I think.

1651
01:45:45,292 --> 01:45:49,693
So yeah. We'll see how you break the last level.

1652
01:45:49,853 --> 01:45:55,554
It's actually really difficult. It's got a lot of finagling and strategy to it.

1653
01:45:56,234 --> 01:45:56,714
Yeah, it is.

1654
01:45:56,914 --> 01:45:57,554
Here you'll see.

1655
01:45:58,494 --> 01:46:01,155
You really have to have the whole picture for this bridge level.

1656
01:46:01,195 --> 01:46:02,875
I'll be fascinated to see how you take it on.

1657
01:46:03,326 --> 01:46:09,791
it's it's very choreographed uh and if and it's really frustrating sometimes because uh

1658
01:46:11,352 --> 01:46:18,777
sometimes uh droids don't go the they don't dance the dance so you're just like you you're not in

1659
01:46:18,817 --> 01:46:19,798
place what are you doing

1660
01:46:22,868 --> 01:46:25,069
I'm gonna bring up my question really quick while we get going on the bridge.

1661
01:46:25,149 --> 01:46:29,851
When you watch Utsu zoom in with the assault rifle or aim in on the assault rifle,

1662
01:46:29,871 --> 01:46:31,772
you see like a pretty significant muzzle flare there.

1663
01:46:32,613 --> 01:46:36,935
And I've begun to notice in shooters when the flare is so bright that I actually have trouble seeing my opponent,

1664
01:46:37,015 --> 01:46:38,236
especially in a PvP game.

1665
01:46:39,056 --> 01:46:42,318
Harley, do you remember any discussions about that, that animation effect,

1666
01:46:42,638 --> 01:46:44,939
when you were working on Republic Commando?

1667
01:46:45,119 --> 01:46:48,420
I don't necessarily remember anything specific to that.

1668
01:46:49,681 --> 01:46:50,381
We played...

1669
01:46:51,721 --> 01:46:57,505
The team played the multiplayer portion every Friday for like the second half of the day.

1670
01:46:57,565 --> 01:47:01,127
We needed to make sure they were, as they say these days, eating their own dog food.

1671
01:47:01,147 --> 01:47:02,448
I don't think that's what we called it back then.

1672
01:47:04,449 --> 01:47:12,434
And we gave a lot of feedback about how stuff that was working in the single-player portion of the game

1673
01:47:12,934 --> 01:47:15,336
might be getting in the way in the multiplayer.

1674
01:47:15,796 --> 01:47:20,319
Most people on the team were pretty avid multiplayer shooter players.

1675
01:47:22,972 --> 01:47:25,913
But I don't remember that one specifically.

1676
01:47:26,854 --> 01:47:32,117
It might have been because I think we had a tendency, and this will not surprise you,

1677
01:47:32,217 --> 01:47:39,881
knowing how much love we put into O7's story, we had a tendency as a team to be either sniper

1678
01:47:40,061 --> 01:47:46,464
or whatever the heavy, I don't remember what that thing is called, anti-armor.

1679
01:47:46,544 --> 01:47:47,344
The DC-17.

1680
01:47:47,364 --> 01:47:47,705
Yeah, yeah.

1681
01:47:52,026 --> 01:48:02,889
And so I'm not sure that that would have gotten the due diligence that it really needed to get that level of polish, if that makes sense.

1682
01:48:03,149 --> 01:48:10,291
That's good. I actually know some, spoken to some other developers, that muzzle flare is often tweaking it as an intentional thing sometimes.

1683
01:48:10,831 --> 01:48:17,353
But yeah. Bradley Ellis would like to know, was there an enemy that was hard to design around based on their difficulty to the player?

1684
01:48:22,893 --> 01:48:31,497
Yes. It's a surprising answer. I think I'm the only level designer who got to use every enemy

1685
01:48:32,037 --> 01:48:37,220
in the game in a level because of the last level. It's basically an old home week for enemies.

1686
01:48:38,660 --> 01:48:44,823
And honestly, the hardest one to design around were the Geonosian young things that come out

1687
01:48:44,843 --> 01:48:48,885
of the eggs. They're surprisingly hard for players to hit.

1688
01:48:50,108 --> 01:48:54,730
They move fast and they can do a lot of damage, especially if you've got more than one of

1689
01:48:54,790 --> 01:48:56,571
them, surprisingly quickly.

1690
01:48:57,831 --> 01:49:06,095
And so being able to put enough of them in the room that they feel creepy enough to commensurate

1691
01:49:06,115 --> 01:49:10,076
to the amount of damage they can do to you very quickly actually turned out to be quite

1692
01:49:10,096 --> 01:49:10,497
a challenge.

1693
01:49:12,155 --> 01:49:19,483
Something I remember, now we're past the bridge, we sort of just rolled past it, but the, uh, something I appreciate in the way that sequence plays out is that, you know, you go to blow the bridge,

1694
01:49:19,984 --> 01:49:28,953
you click the button, the charge doesn't go off, and everyone panics, and that feels like one of the most authentic, uh, you know, everyone from the clones to the advisor panics.

1695
01:49:29,594 --> 01:49:33,158
Um, and I feel like that broad spread, like, wait, what do we do, is one of the neatest.

1696
01:49:35,115 --> 01:49:36,455
Games in general, I love it when they're like,

1697
01:49:36,535 --> 01:49:38,316
oh, you complete an objective, but something went wrong,

1698
01:49:38,336 --> 01:49:39,697
and now you have to upend it.

1699
01:49:39,737 --> 01:49:42,078
Like, it's just such a good tension-raising thing.

1700
01:49:43,019 --> 01:49:46,380
I definitely really like the dialogue in that part.

1701
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:48,001
I was actually just thinking about that as it happened.

1702
01:49:48,041 --> 01:49:52,964
I really like how just genuine 38 sounds

1703
01:49:53,184 --> 01:49:54,845
when he's just like, what, misfire?

1704
01:49:55,125 --> 01:49:56,165
Who packed that charge?

1705
01:49:57,166 --> 01:49:58,646
Who is the idiot who did that?

1706
01:50:01,487 --> 01:50:08,812
Yeah, Mike Stemmly, who wrote a good portion of this game's dialogue, really did just an amazing job.

1707
01:50:08,872 --> 01:50:09,993
When we came to him and said,

1708
01:50:10,634 --> 01:50:14,416
Okay, so we have this huge challenge where we had essentially a character that was one character,

1709
01:50:14,436 --> 01:50:19,300
but now has to be differentiated, and you have to feel like you're part of this brotherhood, blah blah blah,

1710
01:50:19,380 --> 01:50:21,241
can you do it? And you don't have very much time.

1711
01:50:22,182 --> 01:50:24,243
Just did an amazing job.

1712
01:50:25,467 --> 01:50:27,508
you know, as a level designer, you come up with,

1713
01:50:27,608 --> 01:50:29,489
this is the function of this line that I need.

1714
01:50:29,569 --> 01:50:31,230
As you go through your level, you send it off,

1715
01:50:31,270 --> 01:50:31,910
you get it back.

1716
01:50:33,211 --> 01:50:36,092
And I can remember so clearly getting my lines back

1717
01:50:36,172 --> 01:50:37,393
and being like, this stuff is great.

1718
01:50:39,474 --> 01:50:42,335
I absolutely love all the dialogue and just the voice.

1719
01:50:42,395 --> 01:50:43,776
I love just clones in general.

1720
01:50:44,857 --> 01:50:46,678
I think clones are way cooler than stormtroopers.

1721
01:50:47,938 --> 01:50:49,379
I think they're cooler than rebels.

1722
01:50:49,459 --> 01:50:50,500
I think they're cooler than droids.

1723
01:50:50,660 --> 01:50:53,741
They're just my favorite military form.

1724
01:50:54,444 --> 01:50:55,285
the entire series.

1725
01:50:57,846 --> 01:51:01,168
I remember hearing a Disney infinity designer saying it ran

1726
01:51:01,188 --> 01:51:03,769
into a really weird problem when they were making a Star Wars

1727
01:51:03,809 --> 01:51:06,851
Disney infinity product, which was

1728
01:51:07,998 --> 01:51:13,020
they hit a weird age gap between how some players approached their levels, because obviously,

1729
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:18,082
depending on which line of Star Wars they're making content for, you were shooting Stormtroopers

1730
01:51:18,142 --> 01:51:23,063
or you were fighting with clones, and they hit a point where younger players who grew up with

1731
01:51:23,084 --> 01:51:26,645
the prequels and the Clone Wars, so people slightly younger than I think me and Utsu,

1732
01:51:28,065 --> 01:51:33,009
were struck, were not as, they didn't view white armor as bad guys by default.

1733
01:51:33,249 --> 01:51:37,893
I forgot the full context of the quote, so I'm paraphrasing, but I was like, that blew my mind

1734
01:51:37,913 --> 01:51:42,236
because I was like, you know, to me, white armor is by default evil and it's not like, you know,

1735
01:51:42,576 --> 01:51:45,819
when the Clone Wars came around, you know, but like that, like the link between these friendly

1736
01:51:45,859 --> 01:51:49,882
clones and the Stormtroopers was something I appreciated but didn't, you know, internalize.

1737
01:51:49,922 --> 01:51:53,505
But if you go up with the Clone Wars and like Captain Rex was like your action figure or

1738
01:51:53,545 --> 01:51:55,826
something, that's, that's different than what I had.

1739
01:51:56,730 --> 01:51:59,551
Yeah, yeah, visual languages. Go ahead.

1740
01:52:00,151 --> 01:52:02,592
I'm gonna skip a trigger that makes it so I don't have to blow up that door.

1741
01:52:04,213 --> 01:52:04,973
Nice!

1742
01:52:05,333 --> 01:52:06,854
Because I quick-saved and quick-loaded.

1743
01:52:06,874 --> 01:52:07,694
Uh-huh.

1744
01:52:08,274 --> 01:52:15,237
And I'm coming up on some really fun just parkour that skips a little bit of fights.

1745
01:52:17,918 --> 01:52:22,040
Which, the jumps look really, really hard, but they're actually surprisingly easy.

1746
01:52:22,300 --> 01:52:22,460
Mm-hmm.

1747
01:52:24,115 --> 01:52:25,956
It's interesting because he's not like jumping.

1748
01:52:26,796 --> 01:52:30,078
I love that high jump, jump kick the Wookies just did.

1749
01:52:30,598 --> 01:52:30,838
Yeah.

1750
01:52:30,858 --> 01:52:32,019
All right, go ahead.

1751
01:52:32,059 --> 01:52:34,040
Wookie martial arts.

1752
01:52:34,060 --> 01:52:34,661
But here we go.

1753
01:52:36,161 --> 01:52:36,762
Oh my goodness.

1754
01:52:38,703 --> 01:52:39,563
Nice.

1755
01:52:41,124 --> 01:52:41,945
And here it goes again.

1756
01:52:45,026 --> 01:52:46,027
La la la la la.

1757
01:52:47,908 --> 01:52:51,050
Yeah, just these droids are like, all right, let's get this club.

1758
01:52:51,070 --> 01:52:51,850
What is he doing?

1759
01:52:52,130 --> 01:52:53,031
Where is he going?

1760
01:52:53,191 --> 01:52:53,311
What?

1761
01:52:54,729 --> 01:52:55,990
These commandos are weird.

1762
01:52:59,352 --> 01:53:02,574
I always like, I always think of game AI as sort of being like,

1763
01:53:02,614 --> 01:53:04,615
you know, like a working schmuck in a way, because they're always

1764
01:53:04,635 --> 01:53:06,496
they're like, OK, we got to pretend to do the thing.

1765
01:53:07,636 --> 01:53:11,018
Like the very Wreck-It Ralph, like, you know, showing up for a reboot,

1766
01:53:11,058 --> 01:53:12,199
the Canadian animated show.

1767
01:53:12,799 --> 01:53:17,682
And that, to speedrunners, especially like, like just a player

1768
01:53:17,722 --> 01:53:21,104
who is absolutely disregarding the setting and fiction.

1769
01:53:21,164 --> 01:53:23,345
And it's amusing.

1770
01:53:24,270 --> 01:53:30,995
It kind of makes me wish a little bit that this IP had allowed us, uh, fictionally to do Bloodgates,

1771
01:53:31,095 --> 01:53:36,439
but it wasn't a thing. I mean, a few places we did with hacking consoles and stuff, but, um,

1772
01:53:37,460 --> 01:53:39,781
you know, it doesn't really make sense very much in the IP.

1773
01:53:40,362 --> 01:53:42,463
Uh, Bloodgates. Do you mean, like, the keycard hunting of Doom?

1774
01:53:43,344 --> 01:53:47,647
No, I mean, basically, like, we're just not gonna let you out of this room. We're not gonna

1775
01:53:47,908 --> 01:53:51,831
let the exit be openable until you've killed everything in this room that needs killing,

1776
01:53:51,891 --> 01:53:52,091
right?

1777
01:53:52,251 --> 01:53:52,971
Got it, yeah.

1778
01:53:53,232 --> 01:53:53,872
I thought of more.

1779
01:53:54,852 --> 01:53:58,234
That's it, yeah? Like you have to gather the resource from the enemies to kill them?

1780
01:53:58,314 --> 01:53:59,334
Yeah.

1781
01:53:59,635 --> 01:54:01,036
And it just puts a cap on that.

1782
01:54:01,516 --> 01:54:01,836
Yeah.

1783
01:54:02,056 --> 01:54:03,137
Yep.

1784
01:54:05,078 --> 01:54:05,718
Oh no.

1785
01:54:06,119 --> 01:54:13,884
To your comment about white stormtroopers being evil or not evil, those are the kinds

1786
01:54:13,924 --> 01:54:14,904
of details that...

1787
01:54:16,212 --> 01:54:18,893
But usually an IP gives you an advantage on, right?

1788
01:54:18,953 --> 01:54:21,133
Everybody knows the visual language of this thing.

1789
01:54:21,253 --> 01:54:22,893
And so you don't have to teach your players

1790
01:54:22,953 --> 01:54:25,034
to shoot the guys in white or not shoot the guys in white

1791
01:54:25,094 --> 01:54:27,014
because they all know, they all saw the movie.

1792
01:54:27,034 --> 01:54:29,735
But when you talk about a movie that has a history,

1793
01:54:30,215 --> 01:54:32,395
or an IP that has a history that spans

1794
01:54:33,055 --> 01:54:35,355
that many changes in the universe

1795
01:54:36,896 --> 01:54:38,516
and people being more or less familiar

1796
01:54:38,536 --> 01:54:40,036
with different time periods,

1797
01:54:41,217 --> 01:54:42,957
it's really hard to get a shared context

1798
01:54:42,997 --> 01:54:44,797
so that you can take advantage of the IP in that way.

1799
01:54:45,406 --> 01:54:49,008
And it's interesting because if you think about it from like a writing and thematic standpoint,

1800
01:54:49,048 --> 01:54:54,411
like everything that happens is so functional, but like the movies also aren't free from, you know, relying on visual language.

1801
01:54:54,451 --> 01:54:59,233
They need you, the audience, to understand, you know, morally or thematically what's going on.

1802
01:54:59,253 --> 01:55:07,258
And there's conversations about what the prequels, you know, sort of do well, do less well.

1803
01:55:08,218 --> 01:55:11,020
And the fact that they did, you know, get a generation of kids to sort of...

1804
01:55:11,690 --> 01:55:17,134
attached to these characters. It's, um, culturally, uh, if you go on what's Star Wars TikTok and you

1805
01:55:17,154 --> 01:55:21,477
watch like kids even younger than the prequel kids, you know, learning about Star, you know,

1806
01:55:21,497 --> 01:55:25,420
who growing up with Star Wars and making their videos and jokes and references, A, they're

1807
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:32,224
hilarious. Um, B- I love that such a thing exists as Star Wars TikTok. Yeah. Um, so sorry to

1808
01:55:32,244 --> 01:55:37,908
interrupt but, uh, so here I'm doing something kind of interesting where, uh, I'm jumping over

1809
01:55:37,928 --> 01:55:40,430
a trigger that spawns super battle droids. Uh-huh.

1810
01:55:41,426 --> 01:55:44,528
Um, so that Tarfful doesn't die.

1811
01:55:44,548 --> 01:55:49,293
And I'm also making sure my, uh, my troopers don't, uh, don't come in.

1812
01:55:49,333 --> 01:55:52,416
So they also don't hit the triggers because, uh, clone troopers can hit.

1813
01:55:52,896 --> 01:55:54,117
The, the squad can hit trick.

1814
01:55:54,137 --> 01:55:55,458
This is not this hard to jump over.

1815
01:55:55,478 --> 01:55:56,479
It wasn't with me.

1816
01:55:57,200 --> 01:56:00,363
Um, leaning, trying to get you up over it.

1817
01:56:00,463 --> 01:56:03,045
I want to see, I know this isn't that hard.

1818
01:56:05,231 --> 01:56:12,015
I know you can't see it too also, but sometimes when you do a thing that I did a hundred times

1819
01:56:12,095 --> 01:56:17,458
or you don't do a thing, I'm like doing this, like, especially when you trigger an explosion

1820
01:56:17,518 --> 01:56:20,479
and you're right up in front of it, I'm like leaning away from the screen.

1821
01:56:21,080 --> 01:56:23,661
So yeah, so you skip the trigger.

1822
01:56:23,681 --> 01:56:26,563
Tarfful can't hit the trigger that spawns Super Violet Droids.

1823
01:56:28,364 --> 01:56:29,444
Oh shoot, I didn't click save.

1824
01:56:30,065 --> 01:56:30,865
Let me do this again.

1825
01:56:31,966 --> 01:56:32,226
Okay, there.

1826
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:37,782
I remember watching this section and seeing how difficult this whole thing can be.

1827
01:56:40,484 --> 01:56:45,666
I mean, at least it's not a bug you can just stumble into. You've really got to want it.

1828
01:56:47,567 --> 01:56:52,209
Yeah, I feel like those ones are more forgivable. Like the ones that you really have to force. There we go.

1829
01:56:53,409 --> 01:56:55,510
Yeah, so Tarfful can't hit triggers.

1830
01:56:55,530 --> 01:56:58,572
So, you come over here. You jump around this.

1831
01:57:03,654 --> 01:57:08,879
and you can just kind of skip this room a little bit by just shooting this a lot.

1832
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:17,686
Oh boy. And it just destroys it. Oh boy.

1833
01:57:17,826 --> 01:57:21,009
And Harley, I'm pretty sure those those barrows were just meant to say to players,

1834
01:57:21,049 --> 01:57:26,353
don't come over here, don't come over here. Pretty much. Yeah right, you'd have to come in and some...

1835
01:57:27,676 --> 01:57:28,696
But now you're getting triggers.

1836
01:57:29,537 --> 01:57:33,639
These Trandoshans have a lot more health than normal Trandoshans.

1837
01:57:33,719 --> 01:57:35,320
I don't know why they have so much more health.

1838
01:57:38,461 --> 01:57:39,042
I don't either.

1839
01:57:41,243 --> 01:57:53,268
Probably to make this a little bit of a mini boss fight with the Grievous Guard there.

1840
01:57:54,069 --> 01:57:56,810
The first time I saw this enemy, you know,

1841
01:57:58,218 --> 01:58:01,400
I think I had not been believing we were going to be able to pull this off.

1842
01:58:02,061 --> 01:58:06,424
So, I mean, it still had a lot of bugs and a lot of work to go, but the first time I saw this

1843
01:58:06,564 --> 01:58:12,349
anime with what the animators and the AI programmer had managed to do, I was just so excited. I

1844
01:58:12,449 --> 01:58:16,832
couldn't wait to make this guy hoppity-jumpity-flippity around my levels.

1845
01:58:18,082 --> 01:58:21,925
Watch, I love how Utu, like, in the record run that Utu holds,

1846
01:58:21,945 --> 01:58:24,407
you can watch her try to get this guard to actually jump down.

1847
01:58:24,447 --> 01:58:26,308
Because, oh, I don't have record at all.

1848
01:58:26,569 --> 01:58:27,329
I have fourth place.

1849
01:58:29,311 --> 01:58:30,472
That's it. That's it.

1850
01:58:32,133 --> 01:58:34,796
So my recent playthrough, which is on the same difficulty,

1851
01:58:35,156 --> 01:58:37,658
I just looked it up right before we did this, is eight hours.

1852
01:58:38,118 --> 01:58:41,461
Now, to be fair, I am a very slow player, right?

1853
01:58:41,521 --> 01:58:43,383
I like to look at everything and I go around.

1854
01:58:43,443 --> 01:58:46,105
I can't stand it if there's any ammo that I didn't pick up, etc.

1855
01:58:47,132 --> 01:58:48,513
That's just my playstyle.

1856
01:58:49,934 --> 01:58:56,277
So this is less than a quarter of my playthrough on the same difficulty.

1857
01:58:56,317 --> 01:59:00,679
Yeah. You saw me there go to the menu and just load the chapter,

1858
01:59:00,819 --> 01:59:09,124
because that spawns me with more ammo, and it puts my squad at full health.

1859
01:59:10,324 --> 01:59:10,605
Yeah.

1860
01:59:12,777 --> 01:59:15,118
Right, and that's a dev cheat, I believe, right?

1861
01:59:15,199 --> 01:59:19,922
Because we needed to be able to just pop in

1862
01:59:20,082 --> 01:59:22,584
and try new stuff out and have your squad be healthy.

1863
01:59:24,025 --> 01:59:26,147
I think at some point we actually had to ask

1864
01:59:26,247 --> 01:59:29,350
for a dev cheat to give a sort of random amount of health

1865
01:59:29,390 --> 01:59:31,571
to your squad so that we would know what it was like

1866
01:59:31,611 --> 01:59:33,152
to play through the sections of your level

1867
01:59:33,673 --> 01:59:35,654
if you had done more or less well

1868
01:59:36,655 --> 01:59:37,756
in terms of keeping them healthy.

1869
01:59:38,276 --> 01:59:40,678
Was cooperative play ever something

1870
01:59:40,698 --> 01:59:42,280
that you experimented with in this game?

1871
01:59:43,761 --> 01:59:44,902
Not really.

1872
01:59:44,922 --> 01:59:44,962
Uh...

1873
01:59:47,223 --> 01:59:49,064
Yeah, I don't...

1874
01:59:49,784 --> 01:59:52,005
Yeah, I didn't think so, but...

1875
01:59:52,145 --> 01:59:52,245
Yeah.

1876
01:59:52,305 --> 01:59:54,366
It was just kind of something that popped in my head, like...

1877
01:59:54,947 --> 01:59:57,808
And credit to Chad. Chad's actually been asking me about co-op for a second.

1878
01:59:57,868 --> 02:00:00,610
I just sort of... We kept getting on other topics.

1879
02:00:01,050 --> 02:00:01,290
Sure.

1880
02:00:03,211 --> 02:00:05,892
There's talk of the sequel, which I believe has been discussed,

1881
02:00:05,912 --> 02:00:08,293
that a sequel was considered and then cancelled for this game.

1882
02:00:08,720 --> 02:00:09,861
and people in chat were asking,

1883
02:00:09,961 --> 02:00:11,122
oh, would the sequel have had co-op?

1884
02:00:11,162 --> 02:00:12,762
And it's like, well, it never got that far.

1885
02:00:12,842 --> 02:00:15,184
So that's not a question we can really have an answer for.

1886
02:00:15,224 --> 02:00:16,344
You know, the sequel could have had,

1887
02:00:16,704 --> 02:00:18,845
it could have had lat commando sections

1888
02:00:18,886 --> 02:00:19,926
where you're riding in the gunships

1889
02:00:19,986 --> 02:00:21,107
and shooting things for all we know.

1890
02:00:21,507 --> 02:00:24,048
I would so love either a sequel or a remake.

1891
02:00:26,209 --> 02:00:28,530
A remake with like modern day mechanics

1892
02:00:28,570 --> 02:00:29,371
would be really cool.

1893
02:00:30,151 --> 02:00:32,352
Yeah, like there's been a lot of interesting remasters

1894
02:00:32,372 --> 02:00:33,873
like Resident Evil and Final Fantasy

1895
02:00:33,913 --> 02:00:35,214
that have been revisiting old.

1896
02:00:35,574 --> 02:00:36,735
I'd love to see this with like,

1897
02:00:37,914 --> 02:00:44,921
a sprint feature added, maybe some stuff from the new Battlefront that Commandos are in

1898
02:00:44,981 --> 02:00:45,161
now.

1899
02:00:45,682 --> 02:00:49,906
Yeah, the Commandos have made the journey to EA's Battlefront 2, Harley.

1900
02:00:50,306 --> 02:00:53,850
The folks at DICE, DICE does those?

1901
02:00:54,130 --> 02:00:55,471
DICE EA?

1902
02:00:55,491 --> 02:00:57,553
They're still, they're keeping your boys alive.

1903
02:01:00,456 --> 02:01:06,058
I'm so happy that the creators of Clone Wars loved Delta Squad so much that they made them

1904
02:01:06,098 --> 02:01:09,819
canon before Disney's declaration of non-canon.

1905
02:01:10,359 --> 02:01:15,241
Yeah, the reckoning, the splits, the Legends creation.

1906
02:01:15,301 --> 02:01:19,642
I appreciate that as a Star Wars fan, especially when they were heading into an era that the

1907
02:01:20,022 --> 02:01:21,723
books had tread over so thoroughly.

1908
02:01:23,203 --> 02:01:26,884
I appreciate that they just needed to come out and say, we can't maintain this, guys.

1909
02:01:26,924 --> 02:01:27,645
This is really hard.

1910
02:01:27,665 --> 02:01:28,685
We need to start over.

1911
02:01:29,852 --> 02:01:34,701
You know, like I know Delta, Republic Commando isn't canon anymore, but that's never gonna stop the fun I have with it.

1912
02:01:35,001 --> 02:01:37,986
Well, Republic Commando now is canon because, um...

1913
02:01:39,798 --> 02:01:43,960
because of them being in the Clone Wars TV show,

1914
02:01:44,140 --> 02:01:46,902
which thus, by connection, makes this game canon.

1915
02:01:47,322 --> 02:01:50,844
I believe, oh God, I don't want to do more nerd discussions right now.

1916
02:01:50,864 --> 02:01:53,525
I believe, like, officially, like, this is Legends

1917
02:01:53,625 --> 02:01:56,366
because the events of how Kashyyyk, the Kashyyyk battle started,

1918
02:01:56,426 --> 02:01:57,247
had been rewritten over.

1919
02:01:57,447 --> 02:02:00,168
It's like how if you, um, but you know, Halo has the same problem.

1920
02:02:00,208 --> 02:02:01,629
They made a whole book about Fall of Reach,

1921
02:02:01,689 --> 02:02:04,370
and then they made the Reach, Halo Reach, the video game,

1922
02:02:04,751 --> 02:02:06,552
and they play out in drastically different ways,

1923
02:02:06,612 --> 02:02:08,833
even though I actually really like the Fall of Reach book.

1924
02:02:09,767 --> 02:02:13,730
It is really hard to keep a universe consistent over time, especially a long one.

1925
02:02:14,210 --> 02:02:19,733
I just want to insert very quickly, you're back at my level and I'm so, so glad to watch

1926
02:02:19,813 --> 02:02:25,677
you grinding your way up these ramps the way that I hoped people would have to do, even

1927
02:02:25,717 --> 02:02:27,338
in a speedrun.

1928
02:02:28,739 --> 02:02:33,722
I haven't been managing my ammo well, so I'm actually not taking out these super auto-droids

1929
02:02:33,762 --> 02:02:34,882
as efficiently as I could.

1930
02:02:35,523 --> 02:02:38,504
Yeah, you really want heavy armor for those.

1931
02:02:39,239 --> 02:02:42,640
I noticed in the recorded run that you rely on, you're constantly like, it's interesting

1932
02:02:42,660 --> 02:02:46,141
to see where you burn time to go back and get your grenades, you know, like you efficiently

1933
02:02:46,161 --> 02:02:47,541
manage the grenades and stuff, Utsu.

1934
02:02:48,281 --> 02:02:52,922
Like there really is a beauty, if anyone here, I found Utsu's run on speedrun.com, if you

1935
02:02:52,942 --> 02:02:57,363
want to watch Utsu, like really just like show what's going on, there's obviously other

1936
02:02:57,403 --> 02:02:59,824
runners in there you can watch and appreciate too, I just don't know their names.

1937
02:03:01,045 --> 02:03:05,387
But the balance of like and like the weaving between them,

1938
02:03:05,407 --> 02:03:08,169
you know, the skips, but the the ammo management,

1939
02:03:08,249 --> 02:03:11,050
like there's really every runner we've had on this week.

1940
02:03:11,090 --> 02:03:14,392
Bubbles, Delphoi, Go, Dave Stereo, the work,

1941
02:03:14,652 --> 02:03:17,714
like this is a skip and I've been treating this

1942
02:03:17,754 --> 02:03:18,634
like this is a skill.

1943
02:03:18,694 --> 02:03:20,515
This isn't just like I'm coming asking someone to come on

1944
02:03:20,535 --> 02:03:21,976
and play a game.

1945
02:03:22,496 --> 02:03:24,337
That's how I've been thinking and I've been appreciating

1946
02:03:24,357 --> 02:03:25,478
that this whole time this whole week.

1947
02:03:25,538 --> 02:03:26,238
It's been such a blast.

1948
02:03:27,032 --> 02:03:31,576
Watching you walk up and stab that droid dispenser to death is like, you're just stabbing me in the heart.

1949
02:03:31,596 --> 02:03:33,118
LAUGHTER

1950
02:03:36,621 --> 02:03:39,503
Harley, do you have any other memories about working on this particular section?

1951
02:03:40,444 --> 02:03:47,990
So, this whole section, what I really wanted, like, after this, not the next step, but I think the step after,

1952
02:03:48,351 --> 02:03:51,914
you finally get to see the sky again, right? And I really wanted it to feel...

1953
02:03:52,254 --> 02:03:53,936
Essentially, I was drawing a little bit on...

1954
02:03:55,292 --> 02:03:58,693
on Lord of the Rings, I wanted it to feel like this is the section under the mountain

1955
02:03:58,973 --> 02:04:02,354
where you're just really slogging through and then it opens up again.

1956
02:04:03,334 --> 02:04:05,735
And also it's late game, so I wanted it to be really hard.

1957
02:04:09,895 --> 02:04:18,978
The space wasn't really there to put as many maneuver options as I wanted in.

1958
02:04:23,607 --> 02:04:29,008
in order to get all of your squad on screen firing um it was pretty difficult

1959
02:04:30,908 --> 02:04:37,409
gotcha so so there i just jumped over a sugar that spawns march and oceans oh yeah i wonder

1960
02:04:37,429 --> 02:04:42,050
what was going on with these little um uh the little like jumps over the barrels and the rocks

1961
02:04:42,150 --> 02:04:48,132
because when i watched you run i didn't fully understand it yeah that is uh that's just 100%

1962
02:04:48,192 --> 02:04:50,892
making sure that more enemies don't spawn this guy

1963
02:04:51,770 --> 02:04:53,711
Yeah, this guy likes to not get flash banged.

1964
02:04:57,132 --> 02:04:58,153
I don't know why that is.

1965
02:04:58,173 --> 02:04:59,434
Yeah, I don't know why.

1966
02:04:59,454 --> 02:05:01,274
He just kind of doesn't sometimes.

1967
02:05:02,875 --> 02:05:04,516
Which is really frustrating because you throw that

1968
02:05:04,616 --> 02:05:05,477
and you're going fast

1969
02:05:05,597 --> 02:05:07,958
and then suddenly your back is full of bullets.

1970
02:05:08,238 --> 02:05:08,578
Yeah.

1971
02:05:08,978 --> 02:05:10,819
And you're just kind of like, excuse me?

1972
02:05:10,839 --> 02:05:13,620
That's interesting because it hits the normal player too.

1973
02:05:13,681 --> 02:05:14,801
You know, who might be trying to rely

1974
02:05:14,821 --> 02:05:16,642
on flash bang grenades.

1975
02:05:16,822 --> 02:05:16,982
Yeah.

1976
02:05:17,182 --> 02:05:19,483
I wonder if he might be inside some...

1977
02:05:20,291 --> 02:05:30,156
collision initially that, you know, a few more seconds it would be fine, but he's inside

1978
02:05:30,196 --> 02:05:34,478
collision and so from his perspective he's not getting hit by the collision of the grenade

1979
02:05:34,498 --> 02:05:36,359
when it goes off.

1980
02:05:37,860 --> 02:05:41,681
Harley, we have a question from chat, Dave Packers back again, how does it feel to watch

1981
02:05:41,701 --> 02:05:45,083
people, I mean you sort of said this when they're melee cheesing the droid spawners,

1982
02:05:45,103 --> 02:05:48,665
but how does it feel to watch people melee cheese other enemies like the super battle

1983
02:05:48,685 --> 02:05:49,605
droids or the droidekas?

1984
02:05:50,692 --> 02:05:57,038
I mean, sometimes, especially when it's a thing that I'm like,

1985
02:05:57,159 --> 02:06:01,062
oh man, I know exactly what I could have done to fix that.

1986
02:06:01,203 --> 02:06:06,147
It's a little bit hard, but mostly it's just great to watch people

1987
02:06:08,490 --> 02:06:14,476
taking this bit of software and finding new ways to have fun with it.

1988
02:06:17,836 --> 02:06:21,618
The idea that somebody would care enough about a game that you made

1989
02:06:22,439 --> 02:06:28,883
to spend as much time as you would have had to spend to just gain the knowledge, let alone the

1990
02:06:28,963 --> 02:06:38,068
skill to do this, is pretty great, right? Just imagining the many, many hours of somebody working

1991
02:06:38,128 --> 02:06:44,912
to get this far. We are now in the heart of the Citadel, which I believe makes for moving closer

1992
02:06:44,932 --> 02:06:45,932
and closer to the end of the game.

1993
02:06:47,224 --> 02:06:52,428
We've got a little, we have officially 23 minutes left in the schedule, so just a reminder,

1994
02:06:52,468 --> 02:06:55,110
but I don't quite know how that relates to where Utsu is in the run.

1995
02:06:55,951 --> 02:06:59,273
Reminder for folks, if you have questions for Harley, questions for Utsu, throw them

1996
02:06:59,293 --> 02:07:04,297
in chat, we are still grabbing them, even if Utsu and I stop every five minutes to geek

1997
02:07:04,357 --> 02:07:07,760
out about Star Wars, because you can't stop me.

1998
02:07:09,543 --> 02:07:13,984
Gabe throws in that the droidekas in particular have an exploit where if you run up to them,

1999
02:07:14,304 --> 02:07:16,984
they can't shoot you because the guns stick through your body.

2000
02:07:18,285 --> 02:07:20,245
Ew.

2001
02:07:21,265 --> 02:07:24,626
So that wasn't working correctly, so I'm loading just an autosave real quick.

2002
02:07:26,827 --> 02:07:29,727
A lot of things just haven't been working right in this game.

2003
02:07:30,087 --> 02:07:30,827
I don't know why.

2004
02:07:31,848 --> 02:07:37,509
Look, it's GDC Summer, it's every unexpected thing that can happen will happen.

2005
02:07:39,298 --> 02:07:40,539
It's GDC 2020.

2006
02:07:41,600 --> 02:07:43,261
This is how we do GDC this year.

2007
02:07:43,361 --> 02:07:47,504
It's everything going wrong in these uncertain times.

2008
02:07:48,184 --> 02:07:51,186
We are all learning to be the most flexible versions of ourselves.

2009
02:07:51,567 --> 02:07:52,167
There we go.

2010
02:07:53,028 --> 02:07:54,028
Oh, I know what I was doing wrong.

2011
02:07:54,068 --> 02:07:57,811
I was quicksaving, pressing E, then quickloading.

2012
02:07:57,851 --> 02:08:00,273
When I need to press E, then quicksave, quickload.

2013
02:08:01,353 --> 02:08:01,613
So...

2014
02:08:02,034 --> 02:08:04,375
Is this a hack or a fighting game combo?

2015
02:08:05,516 --> 02:08:06,377
So this...

2016
02:08:06,837 --> 02:08:06,917
I'm...

2017
02:08:09,782 --> 02:08:12,284
So, Geonosian Elites are supposed to spawn here,

2018
02:08:13,405 --> 02:08:14,025
but they don't.

2019
02:08:14,866 --> 02:08:16,567
I don't remember exactly the reason.

2020
02:08:16,827 --> 02:08:17,828
I was told the reason once,

2021
02:08:17,848 --> 02:08:19,289
but I don't remember the reason why.

2022
02:08:19,309 --> 02:08:22,031
But yeah, so this is hacking,

2023
02:08:22,071 --> 02:08:24,692
and also I'm not holding E.

2024
02:08:25,733 --> 02:08:27,074
This is just going.

2025
02:08:28,955 --> 02:08:29,315
Nice.

2026
02:08:29,335 --> 02:08:31,437
Nice. Let's take a break.

2027
02:08:31,457 --> 02:08:33,818
I will be, I'll be 100% honest with you.

2028
02:08:34,119 --> 02:08:36,620
This room is my least favorite room in the game.

2029
02:08:36,640 --> 02:08:38,381
So the fact that you figured out how to skip it,

2030
02:08:39,126 --> 02:08:39,927
It's all good, man.

2031
02:08:39,967 --> 02:08:47,115
Yeah, so the Geonosians don't spawn, but when you finish this hack, it gives the Geonosians

2032
02:08:47,155 --> 02:08:48,557
a death command.

2033
02:08:49,458 --> 02:08:51,820
So what happens is the game is just like, here you go.

2034
02:08:52,020 --> 02:08:52,761
You're like, oh, thank you.

2035
02:08:58,606 --> 02:09:03,008
I didn't get to say this earlier, I appreciate whoever on the LucasArts animation team modeled

2036
02:09:03,068 --> 02:09:08,770
this and animated this gun, because the little fingers, they're just like clicky right there.

2037
02:09:09,150 --> 02:09:12,231
When I played this game, there's something satisfying about having that weapon out.

2038
02:09:13,952 --> 02:09:16,673
I was wondering what those were at first, and I learned that those are actually like,

2039
02:09:17,553 --> 02:09:23,836
this gun runs off of like Geonosian blood, so what it's doing is it's trying to stab

2040
02:09:23,876 --> 02:09:26,917
into your arm and take your Geonosian blood, but you don't have Geonosian blood.

2041
02:09:27,614 --> 02:09:30,997
That's why they run out and you can't just put more ammo in them.

2042
02:09:31,337 --> 02:09:33,239
That's, uh, that's... yeah.

2043
02:09:33,739 --> 02:09:37,863
And that's why Geonosian elites can just kind of keep using them over and over again.

2044
02:09:37,923 --> 02:09:39,424
You're like, when are you gonna run out of ammo?

2045
02:09:39,784 --> 02:09:39,964
When...

2046
02:09:41,165 --> 02:09:43,467
I kind of wish there was a mechanic where...

2047
02:09:43,807 --> 02:09:47,771
I understand this game was made in 2005, so I doubt there was even a thing thought about, but...

2048
02:09:48,111 --> 02:09:50,193
It'd be kind of cool if there was a mechanic where, like...

2049
02:09:51,794 --> 02:09:55,417
The more they shot at you with it, like, you'd see their health, like, slowly going down or something.

2050
02:09:56,962 --> 02:10:02,151
Um, it's pretty good narrative and mechanical resonance there, honestly, that little detail.

2051
02:10:02,692 --> 02:10:06,318
Um, actually the game was made in 2003-2004. I think we were basically done by 2005.

2052
02:10:06,358 --> 02:10:06,659
Right, right.

2053
02:10:06,679 --> 02:10:06,839
Yeah.

2054
02:10:11,912 --> 02:10:15,433
Jules Blumenthal says, even though we commented on how, you know, things have been going...

2055
02:10:15,493 --> 02:10:16,653
It's 2020, things go wrong.

2056
02:10:17,233 --> 02:10:18,714
Many things have gone right though on this run.

2057
02:10:18,814 --> 02:10:22,615
Utsu, that's a big thanks to you, and I know I'm going to thank you profusely again at the end,

2058
02:10:22,655 --> 02:10:26,396
but I just want to hope folks in the chat appreciate...

2059
02:10:26,416 --> 02:10:28,697
You know, we got some speedrunners out there in chat, so I know they appreciate,

2060
02:10:28,717 --> 02:10:31,678
but from the development side, I hope folks appreciate that Utsu...

2061
02:10:32,778 --> 02:10:36,259
What Utsu's been showing off today is something that took a lot of practice and time.

2062
02:10:36,799 --> 02:10:37,820
We appreciate having her with us.

2063
02:10:41,182 --> 02:10:46,105
Are you usually in a position where you need to talk and play at the same time when you're speedrunning in Tsuu?

2064
02:10:47,085 --> 02:10:50,167
Uh, not if I'm not, like, wanting to.

2065
02:10:50,648 --> 02:10:51,088
Yeah.

2066
02:10:51,208 --> 02:10:57,872
Uh, my current, uh, personal best, uh, I was quiet for.

2067
02:10:57,892 --> 02:10:58,012
Mm-hmm.

2068
02:10:59,573 --> 02:10:59,773
So...

2069
02:10:59,813 --> 02:11:00,734
That doesn't surprise me.

2070
02:11:03,582 --> 02:11:08,445
We stream games on the GDC Twitch channel and we do so while interviewing developers and I have...

2071
02:11:09,325 --> 02:11:16,909
After a couple years of doing it, I have a process now where I check out the game first and check out how intense it is.

2072
02:11:17,089 --> 02:11:24,813
And depending on the intensity, I will either grab a co-worker to help run the interview or I will pre-record my footage for the game because...

2073
02:11:26,082 --> 02:11:30,803
I've played games while interviewing the developers before, sometimes very intensely, and after every time the developer goes,

2074
02:11:30,843 --> 02:11:34,524
man, like, we have to, you know, like, when we're doing press interviews at E3 or whatever,

2075
02:11:34,584 --> 02:11:37,924
and people want to interview us while we're playing the game, it's impossible. I don't know how you do this.

2076
02:11:38,004 --> 02:11:40,485
And I'm like, yeah, I don't know either. I don't remember the interview.

2077
02:11:41,245 --> 02:11:45,506
Yeah, totally. I, I, very early on in my career, I realized I have to say,

2078
02:11:45,946 --> 02:11:49,566
look, on demos or whatever, I can either play or I can talk. I can't do both.

2079
02:11:50,026 --> 02:11:51,367
Oh yeah, this Wookiee has to die.

2080
02:11:52,287 --> 02:11:54,567
Oh, sorry, Wookiee. Oh yeah, I re- aww.

2081
02:11:55,682 --> 02:11:57,203
He has a rocket launcher and we need that.

2082
02:11:57,283 --> 02:12:01,506
That's mean.

2083
02:12:01,566 --> 02:12:02,426
Yeah.

2084
02:12:03,187 --> 02:12:09,632
That's mean, but he should have just given me that rocket launcher to begin with.

2085
02:12:10,172 --> 02:12:10,612
Fair enough.

2086
02:12:11,933 --> 02:12:13,254
It's interesting because you probably, um...

2087
02:12:13,915 --> 02:12:15,756
Harley, were you working on this solo again?

2088
02:12:16,216 --> 02:12:16,917
Yep.

2089
02:12:17,077 --> 02:12:18,418
Yeah, which means you probably put him in there like,

2090
02:12:18,558 --> 02:12:21,620
oh, let's give the player a friend to help make this fight feel authentic.

2091
02:12:22,360 --> 02:12:24,802
Yeah, I thought he was probably gonna get killed,

2092
02:12:24,842 --> 02:12:27,204
but I didn't think he was gonna get killed by the player.

2093
02:12:27,224 --> 02:12:30,867
Okay, I'm gonna kill my own squad, too, unfortunately.

2094
02:12:30,887 --> 02:12:34,229
Yeah, but they can be revived.

2095
02:12:34,489 --> 02:12:38,613
Right. As long as you're still alive, that's all good.

2096
02:12:39,533 --> 02:12:42,216
It is like, God, this is just one of those moments that feels like, um...

2097
02:12:42,536 --> 02:12:44,377
These Grievous Fires just aren't cooperating.

2098
02:12:45,458 --> 02:12:47,440
Like, they're bouncing around and out of position.

2099
02:12:47,840 --> 02:12:50,902
Yeah, usually they're all supposed to cluster up, like, around there.

2100
02:12:52,067 --> 02:12:58,793
and then uh and then they'll um i'll be able to lock on the rocket launcher and kill all three at

2101
02:12:58,873 --> 02:13:04,358
once but they just weren't having any of it yeah fascinating uh going to chat real quick

2102
02:13:04,518 --> 02:13:08,901
alex jacobson would like to say they've never had a chance to get this much insight into game

2103
02:13:08,921 --> 02:13:12,645
development as a speed runner so this is a cool opportunity as a runner and they're watching

2104
02:13:12,665 --> 02:13:15,567
their friend run a cool game oh thanks alex thank you for joining us

2105
02:13:16,557 --> 02:13:23,759
Matthew Miller would like to say, every time someone interjects a chat comment, they expect to hear about donations, then they remember it's GDC and not GDQ.

2106
02:13:24,619 --> 02:13:29,201
Game development done quick. Which, as Dylan Watson points out, is just a game jam.

2107
02:13:31,662 --> 02:13:38,684
I will say, I think GDQ is going on later this month, and I hope folks who have the opportunity to do so can check it out and donate to that event, because it's a neat event.

2108
02:13:38,884 --> 02:13:42,906
And without them organizing things, you know, we wouldn't have...

2109
02:13:43,366 --> 02:13:49,308
I don't think we would have found each or the other runners we've had.

2110
02:13:49,388 --> 02:13:55,229
Oh, we have a question. John Kruchowski would like to know, how were the levels coordinated

2111
02:13:55,249 --> 02:14:00,071
with the story team? Were the levels made first and then story tacked on, vice versa,

2112
02:14:00,111 --> 02:14:04,172
or a mixture of both? I bet it's a mixture of both. I'm interested to hear how that played out.

2113
02:14:04,832 --> 02:14:10,314
A little bit of a mixture of both. Mostly though, the story team led by Tip Longo,

2114
02:14:10,334 --> 02:14:11,474
who is the creative director.

2115
02:14:11,961 --> 02:14:17,542
wrote the story overall and then split the story up into gameplay parts and handed those gameplay

2116
02:14:17,583 --> 02:14:22,664
parts to us saying okay your job is to make it fun with gameplay and also make sure this part

2117
02:14:22,684 --> 02:14:27,885
of the story gets told. So we're we're coming up with a final level here on the tree part yeah the

2118
02:14:27,905 --> 02:14:33,407
tree climbing yeah the tree part where i if you thought i was wait what do you mean my squad's

2119
02:14:33,467 --> 02:14:39,409
unavailable they're already right behind me huh no oh that's that's not what i want i'm gonna load

2120
02:14:39,509 --> 02:14:41,329
that's a different kind of speedrun bug

2121
02:14:44,926 --> 02:14:48,949
Um, but uh, oh wow I'm all the way back here, interesting.

2122
02:14:50,210 --> 02:14:53,091
All right, I will remember the auto save, or quick save.

2123
02:14:53,832 --> 02:15:00,476
Um, but uh, this is, next, the last level is probably going to

2124
02:15:00,516 --> 02:15:04,399
hurt you a lot if simply destroying these uh, droid

2125
02:15:04,439 --> 02:15:05,640
dispensers does hurt you.

2126
02:15:07,147 --> 02:15:13,334
Because I know the last level is supposed to, like, you drop off your squad at the turrets

2127
02:15:13,414 --> 02:15:18,099
in reverse order of the way you got them and stuff.

2128
02:15:18,239 --> 02:15:20,041
And you'll see what we kind of do.

2129
02:15:21,145 --> 02:15:24,508
While we get back to that section, Gabe, Paf would like to ask,

2130
02:15:24,608 --> 02:15:28,912
did the LucasArts team ever get any pushback on concepts

2131
02:15:28,952 --> 02:15:32,214
like back to in-planetary weapons based on them not fitting with Star Wars?

2132
02:15:32,535 --> 02:15:35,157
Which I think is just a good springboard for conversations

2133
02:15:35,177 --> 02:15:36,958
about how you work with IP holders

2134
02:15:36,998 --> 02:15:39,300
and how you try to build a good partnership with them.

2135
02:15:40,281 --> 02:15:44,504
Yeah, I mean, I was at LucasArts for seven years

2136
02:15:44,524 --> 02:15:46,026
and worked on a number of games.

2137
02:15:47,550 --> 02:15:53,836
And for every one of those, there was always a negotiation with IP for stuff, right?

2138
02:15:53,876 --> 02:15:59,320
Because we were always wanting to and trying to push game mechanics sort of through.

2139
02:16:00,435 --> 02:16:06,581
a narrative sib, if you will, right? And so we'd come up with like, oh, well, we could just make

2140
02:16:06,621 --> 02:16:12,447
this happen. And so, yeah, there were always intense negotiations about that. In terms of

2141
02:16:12,587 --> 02:16:19,854
this particular one, I don't remember that there were any particularly vivid conversations.

2142
02:16:21,934 --> 02:16:27,556
I know that we spent a lot of time mechanically working on how do the back-to-tanks work,

2143
02:16:27,576 --> 02:16:32,377
and we started with just regular health pickups like minigames did and do at the time.

2144
02:16:34,918 --> 02:16:41,459
And I don't exactly remember why we arrived on this, because we really wanted you and your squad

2145
02:16:41,579 --> 02:16:47,701
to feel like you needed to help each other out health-wise. And it didn't make a lot of sense

2146
02:16:47,741 --> 02:16:48,541
to be trading...

2147
02:16:51,321 --> 02:16:55,263
health you are doing a look at trigger thing aren't you

2148
02:16:55,283 --> 02:17:08,210
yeah um this is kind of finicky at all it's a little bit of rng so

2149
02:17:09,571 --> 02:17:10,631
i know what's about to happen

2150
02:17:10,651 --> 02:17:13,413
i think that's good

2151
02:17:18,048 --> 02:17:19,248
Sorry, you've hijacked my brain.

2152
02:17:19,268 --> 02:17:21,769
I was probably in the middle of a word and I can't.

2153
02:17:22,289 --> 02:17:22,869
Oh, no, no, no.

2154
02:17:22,969 --> 02:17:27,151
I actually hardly I would appreciate if you watched this part, because I have to.

2155
02:17:28,011 --> 02:17:30,712
Yeah, I have to restart.

2156
02:17:30,812 --> 02:17:34,453
Actually, I have a hard save, so I can load that next time if I don't get it.

2157
02:17:35,094 --> 02:17:37,934
But yeah, this this part is a little bit of RNG

2158
02:17:39,635 --> 02:17:42,876
since the barrel has to

2159
02:17:43,276 --> 02:17:45,637
it has to fling in a way where I can both get on top of it,

2160
02:17:45,697 --> 02:17:47,698
but it's also high enough for me to get somewhere.

2161
02:17:49,712 --> 02:17:52,054
Oh, that's the wrong kind of... that's the wrong kind of nade.

2162
02:17:53,175 --> 02:17:55,137
Oh whoops, okay here, let me load my hard save.

2163
02:18:03,984 --> 02:18:06,667
Also these, uh, textures are so just...

2164
02:18:08,108 --> 02:18:08,669
Low, uh...

2165
02:18:09,589 --> 02:18:11,071
Low graphics that, uh, it's...

2166
02:18:11,871 --> 02:18:14,494
Hard to line up sometimes, cause I'm just kinda going off of a...

2167
02:18:15,294 --> 02:18:16,075
Vague smudge.

2168
02:18:18,333 --> 02:18:18,553
Here we go.

2169
02:18:18,573 --> 02:18:20,214
I'm gonna try to get this by a hair.

2170
02:18:23,697 --> 02:18:24,858
No, that's not gonna work.

2171
02:18:26,239 --> 02:18:28,341
This is the most finicky part of the run,

2172
02:18:28,381 --> 02:18:30,302
but the skip is very much worth it.

2173
02:18:33,064 --> 02:18:35,206
Yeah, again, hardly, like I said, I went in,

2174
02:18:35,586 --> 02:18:37,007
I was like, oh, she worked on these sections.

2175
02:18:37,248 --> 02:18:37,948
I watched these sections.

2176
02:18:37,968 --> 02:18:39,189
Uh-oh.

2177
02:18:42,392 --> 02:18:44,774
The textures are actually probably lower res

2178
02:18:44,914 --> 02:18:46,055
in this part of the game.

2179
02:18:46,622 --> 02:18:48,302
even on the same objects than they are in other.

2180
02:18:48,322 --> 02:18:51,984
Yeah, I think this will work.

2181
02:18:52,084 --> 02:18:52,705
This might work.

2182
02:18:53,405 --> 02:18:55,086
Um, here we go.

2183
02:18:55,486 --> 02:18:56,146
Here we go.

2184
02:18:56,967 --> 02:18:57,667
Here we go.

2185
02:18:58,327 --> 02:18:59,128
Let it go.

2186
02:18:59,148 --> 02:19:01,089
Let it go. Nice.

2187
02:19:02,089 --> 02:19:04,410
So you walk up here and hold it back anymore.

2188
02:19:04,430 --> 02:19:15,796
And a lovely look at all that Unreal Engine 2 goodness.

2189
02:19:16,464 --> 02:19:20,186
Yep.

2190
02:19:20,366 --> 02:19:21,366
Bradley Ellis would like to know,

2191
02:19:21,406 --> 02:19:23,367
what was your favorite level to design, Harley, and why?

2192
02:19:24,868 --> 02:19:25,869
I think it was this one.

2193
02:19:26,629 --> 02:19:27,789
I got to play with every enemy.

2194
02:19:29,910 --> 02:19:32,372
I actually didn't start out as the level designer for this.

2195
02:19:32,632 --> 02:19:35,633
Kevin Schmidt actually did the paper design

2196
02:19:35,933 --> 02:19:37,894
and had worked with the artist to get the layout.

2197
02:19:38,995 --> 02:19:41,896
But then he transferred over to be the lead level designer

2198
02:19:42,216 --> 02:19:44,877
and brought me in to finish it.

2199
02:19:47,425 --> 02:19:53,788
And so I had this whole thing where I wanted players to face every enemy they'd faced with the squad,

2200
02:19:53,888 --> 02:19:58,210
but to be able to use what they knew about the enemies to face them.

2201
02:19:59,171 --> 02:20:02,712
So 6-2 is over here now, but 0-7-40 are still back there.

2202
02:20:04,253 --> 02:20:08,455
I'm gonna quick save here because this egg here in particular

2203
02:20:09,015 --> 02:20:13,598
will sometimes fall on your head as you're trying to run through.

2204
02:20:15,154 --> 02:20:19,076
Or that one also will land on your head as you're trying to run through.

2205
02:20:19,236 --> 02:20:19,757
Oh no!

2206
02:20:20,757 --> 02:20:21,258
Gotta look up.

2207
02:20:23,979 --> 02:20:28,582
I'm just trying to make the most straightforward path through here because

2208
02:20:29,862 --> 02:20:34,565
you don't kill all these eggs until the very end of the hallway.

2209
02:20:35,646 --> 02:20:40,629
Yeah, and that's how I played this game as well when I was doing it.

2210
02:20:43,677 --> 02:20:46,299
yet interesting because it's kinda like it's not like you're cutting the whole

2211
02:20:46,359 --> 02:20:49,901
room into a to be enough to use your area of effect

2212
02:20:50,322 --> 02:20:51,022
actions

2213
02:20:51,502 --> 02:20:55,045
to handle them as opposed to grinding straight through and dealing with all the little swarms

2214
02:20:55,465 --> 02:20:58,587
yeah if you do that you're just gonna use up all your ammo and be really sad

2215
02:20:59,408 --> 02:21:00,768
so is it a different feeling

2216
02:21:01,589 --> 02:21:01,709
uh...

2217
02:21:02,189 --> 02:21:04,671
oh well actually we're at the key part of the game here so I'm gonna let this play out

2218
02:21:04,711 --> 02:21:05,832
sorry Alec we'll get to your question

2219
02:21:06,663 --> 02:21:08,624
I have a question about this turret.

2220
02:21:09,284 --> 02:21:09,464
Yeah.

2221
02:21:09,925 --> 02:21:12,586
It's fire rate feels so inconsistent.

2222
02:21:12,846 --> 02:21:16,808
Does it have like a set fire rate or anything or ammo count or anything?

2223
02:21:16,828 --> 02:21:20,490
Because sometimes it feels like it takes like five seconds for it to start firing again

2224
02:21:20,550 --> 02:21:21,150
after a burst.

2225
02:21:21,810 --> 02:21:25,312
And then sometimes it feels like if I wiggle my mouse it starts to shoot again.

2226
02:21:26,413 --> 02:21:27,673
Yeah, I don't know the answer to that.

2227
02:21:29,259 --> 02:21:34,121
It doesn't have a set ammo count because we needed people to be able to shoot this thing until it was done

2228
02:21:34,141 --> 02:21:37,922
because this is the end of the game and you can't finish the game until it's done.

2229
02:21:39,142 --> 02:21:40,983
You like my awesome destruction there?

2230
02:21:41,123 --> 02:21:41,503
Yeah.

2231
02:21:42,143 --> 02:21:44,144
And that was nothing like the last time.

2232
02:21:44,164 --> 02:21:45,404
That's it. That's when the run ends.

2233
02:21:45,504 --> 02:21:47,385
Oh no, because you have to do an evac, right?

2234
02:21:47,405 --> 02:21:47,585
Yeah.

2235
02:21:47,625 --> 02:21:51,566
You blew it up so hard there's not a trace of it.

2236
02:21:52,507 --> 02:21:53,207
Oh, hey Scorch.

2237
02:21:53,667 --> 02:21:54,167
Nice.

2238
02:21:54,527 --> 02:21:57,648
If you look on my ally counter, you'll see now that there are two 40s.

2239
02:21:59,851 --> 02:22:04,874
because he's got two arrows because uh 07 and 40 are still back at the beginning of the level

2240
02:22:05,395 --> 02:22:09,778
but it also spawns a 40 and a 62 as if they are rendezvousing with you.

2241
02:22:10,719 --> 02:22:18,545
Oh that's funny. I haven't I haven't remembered trying to script the um changes in the HUD

2242
02:22:18,565 --> 02:22:24,889
up until now. We wanted to show uh yeah. And time would end there. Yep.

2243
02:22:30,010 --> 02:22:34,534
Yep, and now we have the epilogue where sadly Sev gets left behind.

2244
02:22:34,795 --> 02:22:36,717
Oh man, yeah.

2245
02:22:36,877 --> 02:22:40,280
I believe canonically in Legends Sev survived.

2246
02:22:40,561 --> 02:22:47,107
I think Star Wars Galaxies patched him in as an amnesiac clone or something.

2247
02:22:47,648 --> 02:22:48,008
That's it.

2248
02:22:48,148 --> 02:22:50,531
That's the end of Star Wars Republic Commando.

2249
02:22:51,612 --> 02:22:53,474
Utsu, thank you so much for doing that run.

2250
02:22:55,787 --> 02:23:01,491
Yeah, I had a lot of fun. I missed some stuff that I wasn't expecting to miss, but it's all right.

2251
02:23:02,792 --> 02:23:06,014
I mean, it was awesome to get to see you do it, to get to talk to you while you did it.

2252
02:23:07,075 --> 02:23:11,437
And yeah, I know how hard it is to play and talk, so I think you did an amazing job.

2253
02:23:12,738 --> 02:23:15,040
Before we get out of here, we have a couple minutes left in our session,

2254
02:23:15,080 --> 02:23:16,661
so we will take some questions from chat.

2255
02:23:17,649 --> 02:23:19,230
First one is from Alex Jacobson.

2256
02:23:19,490 --> 02:23:23,152
Is it a different feeling, like seeing a skip of a level you made using a bug

2257
02:23:23,172 --> 02:23:26,914
that would have been a mistake of a different part of a team?

2258
02:23:26,934 --> 02:23:32,036
So I guess it's like, if you worked on the level, but then the bug is someone else's responsibility,

2259
02:23:32,857 --> 02:23:36,118
does it sort of feel different versus you going, oh, I did that myself?

2260
02:23:36,959 --> 02:23:42,742
Yeah, it does. I'm much more inclined to forgive somebody else's bug than my own, right?

2261
02:23:43,362 --> 02:23:44,903
So there's...

2262
02:23:46,977 --> 02:23:50,358
You know, earlier I said I wish I could go back in time and fix them.

2263
02:23:50,598 --> 02:23:53,500
That only applies to the bugs that I know I left in there.

2264
02:23:56,441 --> 02:23:59,303
And Heath Close would like to ask, you mentioned paper design,

2265
02:23:59,623 --> 02:24:02,344
what steps did you take to approach a level around this time?

2266
02:24:04,605 --> 02:24:09,227
So, I mean, I think this is probably still true across the board.

2267
02:24:10,548 --> 02:24:12,429
Paper design is a really important step, right?

2268
02:24:13,230 --> 02:24:17,551
it helps you understand the scope of the game, it helps you have conversations with other disciplines

2269
02:24:17,631 --> 02:24:24,654
about the efforts they're going to need to put in. I think that I did paper design for the levels in

2270
02:24:24,694 --> 02:24:31,076
this game in Excel because early on I discovered that I would get really particularly fussy about

2271
02:24:31,116 --> 02:24:35,737
making things look pretty given a tool that would allow that to happen and that that

2272
02:24:36,248 --> 02:24:39,291
was just an unbelievable time sink for me.

2273
02:24:39,371 --> 02:24:41,092
And so I started using Excel

2274
02:24:41,352 --> 02:24:43,975
because you could use little draw tools in Excel

2275
02:24:44,235 --> 02:24:46,456
and there was no possible way you could make it look pretty.

2276
02:24:46,537 --> 02:24:48,718
And so I could let go of that need

2277
02:24:48,798 --> 02:24:51,480
and just really focus and iterate on the concepts,

2278
02:24:51,540 --> 02:24:54,122
the ideas, the layout, the architecture, et cetera,

2279
02:24:54,623 --> 02:24:55,383
of the space.

2280
02:24:57,425 --> 02:25:00,527
And I kept using that trick for a long time.

2281
02:25:01,428 --> 02:25:04,551
That's one of the downsides of having architecture interest

2282
02:25:04,631 --> 02:25:04,951
is that.

2283
02:25:05,907 --> 02:25:11,831
you know, architectural drawings are gorgeous and there's really no reason to spend the time to try

2284
02:25:11,851 --> 02:25:16,513
to make your drawings that pretty, unless you're a trained architect, in which case it comes naturally.

2285
02:25:17,480 --> 02:25:17,920
Right on.

2286
02:25:18,441 --> 02:25:20,021
I'm going to start wrapping things up then.

2287
02:25:20,321 --> 02:25:21,841
For folks who watch this, thank you so much

2288
02:25:21,861 --> 02:25:24,082
for joining the speedrun of Star Wars Republic Commando.

2289
02:25:24,382 --> 02:25:26,682
Thank you to Utsu and Harley Baldwin for joining us.

2290
02:25:26,842 --> 02:25:30,383
Utsu and Harley, if people want to follow you,

2291
02:25:30,483 --> 02:25:31,983
like learn more about what you're doing now,

2292
02:25:32,303 --> 02:25:34,444
Utsu, your other runs, Harley, your work at Shell Games,

2293
02:25:35,164 --> 02:25:36,284
where should they follow you?

2294
02:25:36,384 --> 02:25:37,624
Where should they find you online?

2295
02:25:40,765 --> 02:25:42,125
You can find my Twitter.

2296
02:25:42,685 --> 02:25:44,686
It's is at UtsuMade.

2297
02:25:45,346 --> 02:25:45,466
And.

2298
02:25:46,835 --> 02:25:51,778
my someone else followed my dummy twitch what the hell um

2299
02:25:54,339 --> 02:26:01,903
and then um i'm actually gonna just stop that stream now um and then uh

2300
02:26:04,164 --> 02:26:11,928
what is it um you can find my actual twitch is a twitch.tv forward slash utsuwu i would

2301
02:26:11,948 --> 02:26:15,230
definitely for the folks who followed who somehow found the dummy account i guess probably because

2302
02:26:15,250 --> 02:26:15,590
we're one of

2303
02:26:16,408 --> 02:26:18,809
two accounts streaming Republic Commando right now.

2304
02:26:19,149 --> 02:26:19,669
Maybe.

2305
02:26:20,669 --> 02:26:21,389
I didn't think of that.

2306
02:26:22,650 --> 02:26:24,490
Make sure you follow Utz's main account, Harley.

2307
02:26:24,510 --> 02:26:25,290
Where can they find you?

2308
02:26:26,431 --> 02:26:30,672
I'm MsHarleyBaldwin, M-S Harley Baldwin, on Twitter.

2309
02:26:32,152 --> 02:26:37,114
And yeah, all of my shell games work and also some of the stuff I'm playing and

2310
02:26:37,534 --> 02:26:39,094
struggling with and etc.

2311
02:26:40,054 --> 02:26:40,795
You'll find it up there.

2312
02:26:41,433 --> 02:26:44,836
Right on. Thank you so much to chat for watching. Please make sure to rate this session. Give any

2313
02:26:44,916 --> 02:26:51,540
feedback you have, whether it's about the sound, the video, the audio, what was discussed, do it.

2314
02:26:53,441 --> 02:26:58,964
Thank you, Dylan, for noticing my psycho masks behind me from Borderlands. Normally I would try

2315
02:26:59,004 --> 02:27:03,127
and show off my cats, but I had to change cameras and this one's actually on a narrower angle.

2316
02:27:03,677 --> 02:27:07,478
Um, uh, with that, um, I think that's about it.

2317
02:27:07,498 --> 02:27:10,459
All I'll say is, um, uh, this is our last speed run for the week.

2318
02:27:10,619 --> 02:27:12,020
Uh, we're wrapping up GDC summer today.

2319
02:27:12,300 --> 02:27:13,600
Thank you all so much for joining us.

2320
02:27:13,640 --> 02:27:16,781
We sincerely like we've, we've worked so hard to try and make something fun for

2321
02:27:16,822 --> 02:27:19,703
you, something informative and seeing all these comments talking about how much

2322
02:27:19,723 --> 02:27:22,304
people learned from this game really makes me feel better.

2323
02:27:22,324 --> 02:27:28,306
Um, uh, uh, all I'll say is that other than that, um, uh, I really do feel like,

2324
02:27:28,566 --> 02:27:28,726
like.

2325
02:27:29,493 --> 02:27:32,436
we got to see something special here today with Utsu and Harley.

2326
02:27:32,456 --> 02:27:36,619
And I know I sort of did this partly to torture whatever developer I could get.

2327
02:27:36,639 --> 02:27:39,842
I was like, oh, I want to see break their game and see how their face goes.

2328
02:27:39,862 --> 02:27:40,702
But at the same time,

2329
02:27:42,204 --> 02:27:45,026
like I said, this is speed running is where the line blurs.

2330
02:27:45,046 --> 02:27:49,329
It's where players approach a game literally as the software is implemented,

2331
02:27:49,410 --> 02:27:52,652
not figuratively as the developers intend. And

2332
02:27:53,814 --> 02:27:55,936
I hope it's not our original idea.

2333
02:27:56,256 --> 02:27:57,638
Double Fine and IGN and other folks

2334
02:27:57,658 --> 02:27:58,379
have done runs like this.

2335
02:27:58,419 --> 02:28:00,601
So please go check theirs out as well.

2336
02:28:00,862 --> 02:28:02,503
And I can only stress enough, like, thank you.

2337
02:28:02,584 --> 02:28:03,104
This is cool.

2338
02:28:03,144 --> 02:28:03,745
This is special.

2339
02:28:05,707 --> 02:28:08,630
And yeah, this has been a lot of fun.

2340
02:28:09,972 --> 02:28:10,372
That's it.

2341
02:28:10,392 --> 02:28:10,973
Thank you all.

2342
02:28:12,395 --> 02:28:12,735
All right.

2343
02:28:13,256 --> 02:28:13,957
Take us home, everyone.

2344
02:28:13,977 --> 02:28:14,317
Bye.
