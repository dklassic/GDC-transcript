1
00:00:05,762 --> 00:00:15,030
This is so sick to be up here and see all of you here.

2
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:15,871
Thank you all for coming.

3
00:00:17,772 --> 00:00:19,474
Can you please silence your phones?

4
00:00:21,015 --> 00:00:23,437
And also this talk is very full of spoilers.

5
00:00:24,398 --> 00:00:27,560
So if you have not played Tunic yet and you're like, I might play Tunic one day.

6
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:30,343
If you leave right now, I will fully not be offended.

7
00:00:31,035 --> 00:00:33,837
and it'll be you having an untainted gameplay experience.

8
00:00:34,418 --> 00:00:35,438
So do your thing, please.

9
00:00:36,499 --> 00:00:36,839
Okay.

10
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:38,961
Thank you for coming.

11
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:40,262
My name is Kevin Reggeme.

12
00:00:41,803 --> 00:00:49,009
I was audio director on Tunic and I've been outsourcing and freelance and that kind of work for like 13, 14 years.

13
00:00:49,169 --> 00:00:52,131
I've contributed to 300 some projects.

14
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:54,133
I'm not really sure at this point, various ways.

15
00:00:55,174 --> 00:00:59,117
In sound design and editing and music and voiceover and kind of everything in between.

16
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:02,220
and I also host Realtalk.

17
00:01:02,941 --> 00:01:03,882
Who's seen Realtalk?

18
00:01:04,842 --> 00:01:05,943
Who's been on Realtalk?

19
00:01:07,084 --> 00:01:07,624
Wow, sick.

20
00:01:08,365 --> 00:01:09,786
I should meet all of you later, probably.

21
00:01:11,387 --> 00:01:14,329
Uh, yeah, it's a, it's a bi-weekly stream.

22
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:19,813
We break down and review demo reels from up-and-comers and say, here's how you can increase your chances of being hired.

23
00:01:21,132 --> 00:01:23,816
And also, a bit of a deep cut, who's played Phonopath?

24
00:01:24,817 --> 00:01:25,177
Skitch?

25
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,240
No one else.

26
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:32,227
It's an audio puzzler I made like 2012 and you can't play anymore, it's in Flash.

27
00:01:32,307 --> 00:01:34,990
But if you DM me on Twitter I can just give you all the game assets so you can play it at home.

28
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:35,471
It's a good time.

29
00:01:36,758 --> 00:01:39,940
Okay, so I'm currently creative director at Power Up Audio, though.

30
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,981
We're a team of six up in Vancouver, Canada.

31
00:01:42,981 --> 00:01:45,002
And, yeah, thank you, Power Up Audio, thank you.

32
00:01:45,282 --> 00:01:48,804
We do sound, music, and VO for games, and we're in our 11th year right now.

33
00:01:48,864 --> 00:01:50,125
We have some 150-ish credits thus far.

34
00:01:53,556 --> 00:02:05,381
I like Darkest Dungeon, End of the Breach, Super Meat Boy Forever, Crypt of the Necrodancer, and the new DLCs like Synchrony recently, Decayden's Higher Rule, Celeste, Subnautica Below Zero, Ruined King, and recently Phantom Brigade released in February.

35
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:16,925
And now we're working on Darkest Dungeon 2 with Red Hook, Wayfinder with Airship Syndicate, Moonbreaker with Animal World Entertainment, and Rift of the Necrodancer with Brace Yourself Games, and Earthblade from the Celeste devs.

36
00:02:17,545 --> 00:02:18,546
So we're real busy.

37
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:22,029
but we're talking about tunic today, yes?

38
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,691
It's gonna be a, aw, you.

39
00:02:25,452 --> 00:02:26,973
No, it's gonna be a breakneck speed talk.

40
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:28,254
I have like 300 slides.

41
00:02:28,795 --> 00:02:30,416
So it's like an animation basically.

42
00:02:30,436 --> 00:02:31,557
It's gonna be just nonstop.

43
00:02:32,217 --> 00:02:34,079
So it's gonna be a lot of stuff.

44
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:36,141
This isn't really an essay format style talk.

45
00:02:36,221 --> 00:02:41,525
We're just gonna blast through a bunch of shit and hopefully some of it lands and you find it inspiring or interesting or helpful.

46
00:02:41,705 --> 00:02:42,026
Sound good?

47
00:02:43,194 --> 00:02:43,775
Okay, sweet.

48
00:02:44,256 --> 00:02:49,763
So there'll be some creative directions, some technical implementation and sound design techniques and how-tos and hot tips.

49
00:02:50,464 --> 00:02:53,288
And also we'll talk about game design and forming some audio decisions.

50
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,173
And the talk might get a bit wild, so please enjoy.

51
00:02:57,247 --> 00:03:00,429
Okay, first up, we are talking about creative direction.

52
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:03,971
And the first thing is we went for a rounded kind of sound design.

53
00:03:04,432 --> 00:03:12,337
We're talking simple and smooth contours, like not, you know, but cool with that.

54
00:03:12,857 --> 00:03:13,818
All right, that land.

55
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:14,158
Okay.

56
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:21,383
Also tamed transient, so less ta and ka and more da and ja is great.

57
00:03:22,283 --> 00:03:25,125
You know, and pleasing frequencies.

58
00:03:25,185 --> 00:03:26,006
Here's some white noise 321.

59
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:28,948
Bring it up, Ru.

60
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:30,929
We all love some white noise, right?

61
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:32,490
And here's... Can I play it again?

62
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:32,990
Let's do it again.

63
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,670
Can I?

64
00:03:35,211 --> 00:03:35,551
Yeah.

65
00:03:35,851 --> 00:03:36,892
And here's pleasing white noise.

66
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,053
Yeah, it's warm, right?

67
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:40,954
Okay.

68
00:03:41,974 --> 00:03:52,218
Here's a good example in-game of some... Some round sound design.

69
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:53,979
No shrill, no piercing, no scraping.

70
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:55,200
Just soft everything, you know?

71
00:03:56,226 --> 00:03:58,729
Next up, some generalized and synthy stuff.

72
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:01,493
We don't want to lean on library source recordings too, too much.

73
00:04:01,573 --> 00:04:07,641
They do appear all over the game, certainly plenty, but we don't want to be focused too much core wise, you know.

74
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:09,883
So here's the air boss coming up next.

75
00:04:09,923 --> 00:04:11,385
It's the air, it's the final boss of the game.

76
00:04:12,793 --> 00:04:13,814
It'll be three iterations.

77
00:04:14,194 --> 00:04:15,715
V1 was a bit too much.

78
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,857
It's a sword, just too real.

79
00:04:18,317 --> 00:04:21,319
The second one, Craig Barnes was the designer on this, on our team.

80
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:26,303
Craig went a little more stylized, got kind of like thunderous and crunchy, is a bit too far, too aggressive.

81
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:30,606
And it came back in this really nice synthy zinging, zingy whoosh area.

82
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:31,347
So have a listen.

83
00:04:31,467 --> 00:04:32,468
It's a bit subtle, so check it out.

84
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:44,611
Too crunchy.

85
00:04:44,971 --> 00:04:45,472
Now zing.

86
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,183
And one more victory lap for Kite Barns.

87
00:04:56,718 --> 00:04:57,358
Thanks Craig.

88
00:04:57,558 --> 00:04:58,118
Okay, next up.

89
00:04:58,559 --> 00:05:02,000
We got, this can be very video game, the sound wise.

90
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,061
We're talking non-diegetic sound is great.

91
00:05:05,601 --> 00:05:07,822
Anything for the sake of the player is great.

92
00:05:08,522 --> 00:05:13,143
Things like physical objects don't need consistent sonic properties.

93
00:05:13,283 --> 00:05:14,584
Nothing needs to make sense.

94
00:05:14,644 --> 00:05:17,505
It's totally fine and there'll be plenty of this in the talk.

95
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,385
We'll get to that later on.

96
00:05:18,445 --> 00:05:20,506
So we're gonna move into some technical implementation now.

97
00:05:21,046 --> 00:05:22,086
This is the listener.

98
00:05:22,306 --> 00:05:23,567
Who knows what the listener is?

99
00:05:24,187 --> 00:05:24,948
It's real important.

100
00:05:25,088 --> 00:05:28,150
It is basically the audio version of the camera.

101
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,491
It's the ear in the world.

102
00:05:30,111 --> 00:05:33,474
The camera gives us a window into the world and the listener gives us an ear.

103
00:05:33,554 --> 00:05:39,718
So the placement is paramount and it dictates everything you're going to hear in the mix and everything the player is going to do as a result.

104
00:05:39,758 --> 00:05:41,439
It's super, super fucking important to get it right.

105
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,381
So where does it go though?

106
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:43,981
What's the goal?

107
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:51,867
The goal is to communicate everything the player needs to know to them in a way that they expect and can react to, they can perceive in a meaningful manner.

108
00:05:52,507 --> 00:05:52,688
So

109
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,431
For example, first person shooter, where's it going to go?

110
00:05:57,472 --> 00:05:57,932
On the head.

111
00:05:58,212 --> 00:05:59,252
Carly says on the head.

112
00:05:59,312 --> 00:05:59,873
Okay, sweet.

113
00:05:59,953 --> 00:06:00,333
Correct.

114
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:01,253
Well done, everyone.

115
00:06:01,313 --> 00:06:01,633
Carly?

116
00:06:02,574 --> 00:06:02,854
Okay.

117
00:06:03,274 --> 00:06:03,534
All right.

118
00:06:03,594 --> 00:06:05,755
So, it's on the head, of course.

119
00:06:05,995 --> 00:06:07,316
The eyes are on the head, the ears are on the head.

120
00:06:07,636 --> 00:06:11,277
If they hear a door open to the right, the player turns to the right and they shoot the guy, right?

121
00:06:11,377 --> 00:06:12,238
It's going to work out for them.

122
00:06:13,098 --> 00:06:15,999
And but for a game like Celeste, a platformer, it's 2D.

123
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:19,600
If we have a listener on the player character, it's not going to make as much sense.

124
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,761
That fire's going to sound like it's a hard left.

125
00:06:22,241 --> 00:06:23,982
But the player's looking at the fire right in front of them.

126
00:06:24,002 --> 00:06:26,783
It should sound like it's right in the middle, in the middle of the panorama, yeah?

127
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:34,065
So instead, it's more like we pull the listener back from the plane of the gameplay, like it's going to match the player on their couch at home, you know?

128
00:06:34,345 --> 00:06:34,585
OK?

129
00:06:35,546 --> 00:06:36,226
But what about Tunic?

130
00:06:36,846 --> 00:06:38,947
What do you do for an isometric game?

131
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:43,111
You might think, listener on the camera, because you're seeing the world, it's right in front of you.

132
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:46,672
But here's an image I've sent to many clients, problems that arise with this.

133
00:06:47,272 --> 00:06:57,155
The distance from the camera or the length of space between the camera and the target of the camera, that is the center of the screen, what the player is currently focused on, is like a hypotenuse in a right triangle.

134
00:06:57,655 --> 00:07:04,617
And the thing is, if the listener is right in the camera, stuff beneath the camera and listener in 3D space will be nearer and therefore maybe louder.

135
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:08,018
And suddenly we have a disconnect between what the player is looking at and what the player is hearing.

136
00:07:08,058 --> 00:07:09,618
It's a big problem in terms of communication.

137
00:07:10,365 --> 00:07:13,126
So instead, here's a solution for Tooth and Tail, the last game.

138
00:07:13,626 --> 00:07:17,688
We move the listener above the center of the screen, the target of the camera.

139
00:07:17,788 --> 00:07:19,568
And now we have absolved that problem.

140
00:07:19,608 --> 00:07:23,309
We now have the things that are closest to the listener are the thing that the player's looking at.

141
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,911
So for Industries of Titan, it's a little more complex so that you can zoom out.

142
00:07:27,931 --> 00:07:29,832
There's like zoom levels, it snaps to zoom levels.

143
00:07:30,332 --> 00:07:33,833
So our solution was to just scale the listener position also.

144
00:07:33,893 --> 00:07:35,514
So the camera comes out and the listener comes out too.

145
00:07:35,974 --> 00:07:36,454
Easy, right?

146
00:07:37,154 --> 00:07:40,197
And going further, we also employed cone attenuation.

147
00:07:40,678 --> 00:07:45,122
So if we're really far out, there may be something like down low right, some ship battle or something we want to hear.

148
00:07:45,603 --> 00:07:50,268
But if we're super close in, we might not want to hear that thing way off to the right, because the player is looking at this right now.

149
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,589
Or maybe less of it at least.

150
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:55,753
So things outside that angle of the cone would be turned down as a result.

151
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,321
For a game like Hades, Darren Korb put the listener on Zagreus, and it was still 3D audio.

152
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:06,023
They put the sound size in FMOD, so they're automating sound size.

153
00:08:06,423 --> 00:08:08,423
It's a bit hard to describe in a short talk like this.

154
00:08:08,723 --> 00:08:11,424
I mean, in a long talk, but in this short slide.

155
00:08:12,384 --> 00:08:17,686
The gist, though, being that as things get farther away from Zagreus, they become more directional in quality.

156
00:08:18,226 --> 00:08:20,267
It's a bit easier to understand with a game like Death's Door, though.

157
00:08:20,327 --> 00:08:22,947
David Fenn put the listener on the player character as well.

158
00:08:23,787 --> 00:08:25,748
And automated spread in Wwise.

159
00:08:26,028 --> 00:08:29,349
So the farther it is away, the less spread there is, yeah?

160
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,090
So imagine there is a sound source on the crow, our hero character.

161
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,890
If it's mono, we have widespread.

162
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,091
That means coming out both speakers.

163
00:08:36,151 --> 00:08:39,852
Therefore, the phantom image is right in front of you, and it sounds like it's right in front of you in the middle of the screen.

164
00:08:40,072 --> 00:08:40,732
Makes sense, right?

165
00:08:41,452 --> 00:08:42,933
consistent with the player expectation.

166
00:08:43,293 --> 00:08:50,078
If it's a stereo sound, it might be that it has full spread and we have full envelopment, like there's a big ass waterfall or something and it wants to take over the entire mix.

167
00:08:50,498 --> 00:08:52,099
If it's in the middle, we're gonna hear full spread too.

168
00:08:52,560 --> 00:09:01,205
As the sound source moves to the right, we're going to have the whole spread moving right, the phantom image moves, the spread of the waterfall moves, and further yet, it gets less and less spread and more point source.

169
00:09:01,386 --> 00:09:05,508
Likewise, far away in front, you may have that stereo sound moves to a point source.

170
00:09:05,528 --> 00:09:07,990
You hear the waterfall over there rather than all around you, yeah?

171
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:08,931
Make sense so far?

172
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:09,892
Okay.

173
00:09:09,912 --> 00:09:10,653
A lot of nods.

174
00:09:10,913 --> 00:09:11,173
Awesome.

175
00:09:12,075 --> 00:09:12,315
Okay.

176
00:09:12,415 --> 00:09:14,919
But the thing is, all of these games use 3D audio natively.

177
00:09:14,939 --> 00:09:17,082
It's like native 3D audio in Wwise and FMod.

178
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,207
But for Tunic, we have things like altitude differences.

179
00:09:20,307 --> 00:09:22,010
We have enemies making sounds.

180
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:25,155
There's sound sources above and below the characters, sometimes in other rooms.

181
00:09:25,655 --> 00:09:50,498
we have a ton of camera play that camera can pan around the player it can go above the player we have envelopment to consider with all these issues as well so in the end we decided no we're not going to do 3D space we're going to do screen space instead so what this means in practical terms is every sound is playing in 2D in the game and we're driving the playback with a set of parameters to define how it comes across to the player

182
00:09:51,528 --> 00:09:52,989
So these are the parameters.

183
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:59,431
We have off-screen distance, screen space X position, screen space Y position, ortho size, and altitude delta.

184
00:10:00,051 --> 00:10:01,531
So off-screen distance is the easy one.

185
00:10:01,551 --> 00:10:03,672
It just simply is the sound source on the screen.

186
00:10:03,712 --> 00:10:04,993
Is it here at all?

187
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,673
Is it here far away, near?

188
00:10:06,693 --> 00:10:07,213
It doesn't matter.

189
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:07,674
Is it there?

190
00:10:08,114 --> 00:10:08,774
Then it's zero.

191
00:10:08,894 --> 00:10:10,174
If not, how far away is it?

192
00:10:10,595 --> 00:10:11,535
Is it one away?

193
00:10:11,595 --> 00:10:12,615
Is it 40 away?

194
00:10:13,095 --> 00:10:19,818
And then we can just make kind of classical, typical-looking attenuation curves that you'd see in like a 3D spatializer in FMOD.

195
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,838
X position and Y position, very simple.

196
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,239
Zero is the center of both.

197
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,682
Positive one, negative one for X and Y and beyond.

198
00:10:27,742 --> 00:10:30,985
It could be like 40 away to the left in X position, right?

199
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:31,366
Negative 40.

200
00:10:33,143 --> 00:10:37,524
So with the panning, with the X position, we can handle panning so it makes sense, right?

201
00:10:37,724 --> 00:10:41,105
We have things on the left side of the screen come out the left side of the speakers.

202
00:10:41,585 --> 00:10:43,406
Again, we're just being consistent with player expectation.

203
00:10:43,986 --> 00:10:46,626
And up top there, keep in mind, this is the edges of the screen, yeah?

204
00:10:46,966 --> 00:10:48,287
So that's gain up top.

205
00:10:48,707 --> 00:10:51,528
What this means, this is on both Y and X in some cases.

206
00:10:51,588 --> 00:10:54,328
And if you can picture, that means if you're in the middle of the screen, you're a bit louder.

207
00:10:54,708 --> 00:11:01,110
We still wanna hear things at the left, but if it's right in the middle, it's probably a little more relevant to the players, so we'll hear it just a bit bumped up in the mix.

208
00:11:02,717 --> 00:11:03,998
Altitude delta is a little bit weirder.

209
00:11:04,258 --> 00:11:10,964
It is simply the difference in vertical height between the fox character and the sound source in 3D space.

210
00:11:10,984 --> 00:11:11,904
So this is the unity view.

211
00:11:12,245 --> 00:11:13,606
We have a little scavenger above.

212
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:14,226
That's our height.

213
00:11:14,246 --> 00:11:14,426
Yeah.

214
00:11:15,287 --> 00:11:20,851
And ortho size, orthographic size is kind of the weirdest one, but a decent analogy would be something like a telephoto lens.

215
00:11:21,612 --> 00:11:25,355
The camera position isn't changing across these photographs.

216
00:11:25,735 --> 00:11:27,437
It's just the gear used, right?

217
00:11:27,497 --> 00:11:34,604
And changing the lens, changing the settings, it alters the amount of world that we're seeing as a result.

218
00:11:35,004 --> 00:11:37,527
So something like this, this is ortho size 15.

219
00:11:38,528 --> 00:11:41,751
This green prism to the right here, that isn't the camera.

220
00:11:41,771 --> 00:11:44,013
It's just like a mock-up by me to show you like here's what it

221
00:11:44,253 --> 00:11:46,174
where it might be and here's like a window into the world, yeah?

222
00:11:46,754 --> 00:11:49,615
So, something with this green prism, this is 15, this might be 50?

223
00:11:49,755 --> 00:11:50,996
Does that make sense?

224
00:11:51,596 --> 00:11:57,178
So, you're not pulling the 15 back to see more of the world, you're just making the prism bigger.

225
00:11:58,038 --> 00:12:01,259
So, this again, 15, this might be 50, but the camera hasn't moved.

226
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:04,160
So, again, we couldn't like scale listener distance with camera position and stuff, right?

227
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:04,840
Wouldn't make any sense.

228
00:12:05,621 --> 00:12:07,341
Here's eight, if you're curious, and here's one.

229
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:08,862
Look at his feet, it's so cute.

230
00:12:09,724 --> 00:12:26,214
Okay, so again, everything is in 2D, kinda, but, and without native 3D spatializers, and this text here is a debug tool that Andrew Sholdice, the primary developer, threw together for us, and it really helped in like live update with FMOD to kind of keep track of where the numbers actually were for a given sound source.

231
00:12:26,254 --> 00:12:28,116
So we'll see it in action with some waterfalls here.

232
00:12:29,196 --> 00:12:30,937
It's only three point source sounds for all these waterfalls.

233
00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:34,880
I'll be debug warping around just to watch the numbers there.

234
00:12:40,646 --> 00:12:48,148
So because we know as developers exactly where the player can go, we can set up curves to suit to ensure things sound correct.

235
00:12:48,928 --> 00:12:49,288
Make sense?

236
00:12:50,288 --> 00:12:51,029
Okay, sweet.

237
00:12:51,989 --> 00:12:58,090
And on top of that, it's not just making sure things sound correct, we can tell a story as well.

238
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:02,351
So with this tuning fork up top, altitude delta is now zero.

239
00:13:02,371 --> 00:13:03,371
We're right in front of it.

240
00:13:04,372 --> 00:13:05,732
It's all we care about as a player, right?

241
00:13:06,212 --> 00:13:07,572
Come back down, it comes down a bit in the mix.

242
00:13:07,592 --> 00:13:09,073
We can go away, fade away.

243
00:13:12,093 --> 00:13:15,877
perhaps towards it again, we can drop off entirely to the left.

244
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,500
Because over here, it doesn't matter at all.

245
00:13:18,901 --> 00:13:23,205
But walking up on this thing, we get a taste again because the camera's panning over.

246
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:24,266
It's all just done with the curves.

247
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:28,731
And if you're thinking, holy fuck, Kevin, how many curves did you make?

248
00:13:28,972 --> 00:13:29,572
Yeah, a lot.

249
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,538
but we have FMOD effect chain presets on our side.

250
00:13:33,578 --> 00:13:45,889
So like the spider preset, for instance, we set up panning and or the exposition and the off-screen distance, all these curves we need for a given enemy and drop that effect chain preset on all the given events like hurt and attack and death and so forth.

251
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:53,715
And then if we think, oh, we want to hear the spider from a bit further off screen, I can change that curve in one place and it'll proliferate across all the places we need it to change.

252
00:13:53,935 --> 00:13:54,256
Make sense?

253
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:55,377
Super useful.

254
00:13:55,437 --> 00:13:58,739
Shout out to Matt Block for telling me that because I'd never used it before.

255
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,642
Dynamic music and ambience is our next thing.

256
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:03,823
Here it is in action.

257
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:06,444
We're going to see a little crossfade, find a waterfall.

258
00:14:07,285 --> 00:14:08,686
We'll go to the piano instead.

259
00:14:16,411 --> 00:14:20,073
And then we're going to fade out entirely as we discover a secret room.

260
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:20,974
I told you there were spoilers.

261
00:14:32,975 --> 00:14:33,495
So easy.

262
00:14:33,575 --> 00:14:34,536
Here's that room in Unity.

263
00:14:35,476 --> 00:14:38,678
And here's our first basic trigger volume to talk about.

264
00:14:38,698 --> 00:14:39,958
There's a portal there.

265
00:14:39,978 --> 00:14:42,159
You can see where the fox spawns into the scene.

266
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,842
These guys here, these portals, have a play music on load script.

267
00:14:47,302 --> 00:14:49,743
Each scene in Unity has a play music on load script.

268
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,384
You can see the event there at the top.

269
00:14:51,464 --> 00:14:52,765
It's one of the tracks in the game.

270
00:14:52,965 --> 00:14:56,287
And coincidentally, this track in this scene is the same one as in the overworld.

271
00:14:56,327 --> 00:14:58,188
So nothing happens for the script.

272
00:14:58,328 --> 00:15:03,612
But we also have the parameter data on the basic trigger down below, the volume trigger.

273
00:15:04,432 --> 00:15:08,835
And in this case, we say overworld layer 3 should be 1 now, and 2 and 1 should be 0.

274
00:15:09,155 --> 00:15:12,357
So we're going to fade out entirely over that piano.

275
00:15:12,938 --> 00:15:16,060
And then down here, we have a gradient trigger volume instead.

276
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:24,226
It's kind of similar, but we have an A and B on each side, so we're able to float between two parameter values over the length of the volume.

277
00:15:24,766 --> 00:15:28,029
So you can see here it says, go from 1 to 0, from A to B, yeah?

278
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,650
We have these all over the game.

279
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,052
Here's one in the overworld.

280
00:15:31,452 --> 00:15:33,454
It's the first one most players encounter.

281
00:15:35,255 --> 00:15:39,078
We fade to kind of the B side of the overworld tunes.

282
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,862
So in this case, we're fading 1 on each side and 0 on each side, right?

283
00:15:44,122 --> 00:15:44,843
Not just 1 fading out.

284
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:47,990
And next up is another main trigger type.

285
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:51,492
This is a room-specific trigger in the Frog Cave Vault.

286
00:15:51,572 --> 00:15:54,953
The player's got in here looking for a green key, and they see, oh no, it's empty.

287
00:15:55,774 --> 00:15:58,055
So we have a room system to handle a bunch of stuff in the game.

288
00:15:58,095 --> 00:16:01,797
It handles rooms kind of fading in and out of view as you go through doorways.

289
00:16:02,117 --> 00:16:02,817
It handles a bunch of stuff.

290
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:05,159
And it also handles some audio here for us.

291
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:11,702
So the volume, the gist is the volume only works if the current room that the fox is in is active.

292
00:16:12,282 --> 00:16:15,644
So in this case, we have a door with a trigger on each side.

293
00:16:18,134 --> 00:16:20,916
and we're able to snap according to the room being activated.

294
00:16:22,237 --> 00:16:29,221
It's a bit better than having a gradient there where the player can like walk kind of half in the gradients and then the sound is changed halfway but the room snapped over.

295
00:16:29,482 --> 00:16:30,862
It's just a little bit more elegant, right?

296
00:16:31,823 --> 00:16:33,865
So next up, tuned sound effects.

297
00:16:33,925 --> 00:16:35,245
Tuning sound effects to the music.

298
00:16:35,506 --> 00:16:36,446
Let's have a look.

299
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:47,894
So many sounds in the game will always play in tune with the music regardless what track is playing.

300
00:16:57,213 --> 00:16:57,773
But how?

301
00:16:58,134 --> 00:17:00,235
We did this in every single music event.

302
00:17:00,856 --> 00:17:11,865
We dropped command instruments across the board that were sending global parameter settings, in this case, set music key center to C, to F, or to G sharp.

303
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,326
Any fans of G sharp out there?

304
00:17:13,806 --> 00:17:15,448
Yeah, H sharps, okay.

305
00:17:15,788 --> 00:17:18,530
Yeah, I know humans are reading this, so the letters don't really matter, right?

306
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,792
It's just like C, C sharp, D, D sharp, E, F, et cetera.

307
00:17:21,352 --> 00:17:26,054
So, all that said, we have two things to deal with mainly in-game, two problems to solve.

308
00:17:26,214 --> 00:17:28,455
One is held and one is one-shot sound effects.

309
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:30,136
The held is the easy one.

310
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:45,982
The changing room music event is simply throwing parameter data over to this event for the prayer.

311
00:17:47,063 --> 00:17:48,203
And it's like, cool, gotcha.

312
00:17:48,303 --> 00:17:49,304
And it just changes over time.

313
00:17:49,704 --> 00:17:50,084
No problem.

314
00:17:55,557 --> 00:17:58,078
but one shots what do you do?

315
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:00,019
Some problems arise.

316
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,963
So if a command is sent after a sound is done, we're good.

317
00:18:06,183 --> 00:18:06,823
It's totally fine.

318
00:18:07,584 --> 00:18:08,024
No problem.

319
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,946
But if it's sent during the sound,

320
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,407
we can get re-triggering going on.

321
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,348
It'd be very likely for players to encounter this, yeah?

322
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:24,091
And some of you out there are like, ah, Kevin, come on, just hold value during playback, it's so easy.

323
00:18:24,151 --> 00:18:26,132
Well, this would break the held ones, unfortunately.

324
00:18:26,152 --> 00:18:29,114
It's a cool idea, it's super useful, lifesaver, checkbox.

325
00:18:29,794 --> 00:18:34,497
But, uh, we wanted to use only one parameter to control everything, and it's gonna break one of them, right?

326
00:18:35,257 --> 00:18:37,918
So, our solution was this, a big-ass transition hub.

327
00:18:37,938 --> 00:18:37,978
So,

328
00:18:40,014 --> 00:18:43,836
When the event starts, these are all conditional transitions.

329
00:18:43,876 --> 00:18:46,737
They say what keys are currently in, and it sends it to the right place.

330
00:18:46,797 --> 00:18:50,238
In this case, it says, go to G sharp, our favorite, and then to the end.

331
00:18:50,738 --> 00:18:54,040
So regardless of what plays, it's going to go to the right place and then go to the end.

332
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,262
And if a parameter changes during that event, it doesn't matter anymore, because it only mattered when the event started.

333
00:18:59,662 --> 00:18:59,902
With me?

334
00:19:00,803 --> 00:19:01,523
OK, awesome.

335
00:19:02,836 --> 00:19:08,458
Last thing, some of you may have been keenly noticing that these command instruments are a bit pushed ahead of the beat division.

336
00:19:09,218 --> 00:19:13,139
And if you like play jazz or just composers, whatever, you might know of like a push.

337
00:19:13,639 --> 00:19:16,340
So you put a note that applies to the next chord.

338
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,241
So it rings out in the right key as opposed to being in the old key.

339
00:19:19,821 --> 00:19:21,082
So we have this happening.

340
00:19:32,312 --> 00:19:32,812
Pretty cool, right?

341
00:19:33,353 --> 00:19:33,493
Right.

342
00:19:34,053 --> 00:19:35,014
Sound design techniques.

343
00:19:35,395 --> 00:19:38,717
This kind of blurs with the previous technical stuff, but just we're just gonna keep going, okay?

344
00:19:39,718 --> 00:19:44,002
So first up, first is the Siege Engine Foley, one of the bosses in the game.

345
00:19:44,102 --> 00:19:45,463
Here it is with the boss soloed.

346
00:19:45,483 --> 00:19:49,406
FL Studio, any fans?

347
00:20:01,874 --> 00:20:02,334
for life.

348
00:20:02,374 --> 00:20:04,315
I've been there since like version 2.7 or something.

349
00:20:04,355 --> 00:20:04,796
It's the best.

350
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,477
So, uh, this is a 3D granulizer.

351
00:20:07,597 --> 00:20:08,758
I've used it so much.

352
00:20:08,918 --> 00:20:09,738
It's my favorite ever.

353
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:11,679
Most granulizers have the same, like, similar functionality.

354
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:17,142
So we'll just, you know, Mangler or whatever you're using, just, uh, transpose this to that stuff instead.

355
00:20:17,602 --> 00:20:18,603
This knob is the best one.

356
00:20:18,623 --> 00:20:19,563
It's the random knob.

357
00:20:20,744 --> 00:20:23,946
And these are a bunch of layers of different stone sounds.

358
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:24,846
Here it is in action.

359
00:20:24,866 --> 00:20:25,026
Yeah.

360
00:20:27,948 --> 00:20:28,868
So here's no random.

361
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:30,189
We're going to crank it up.

362
00:20:31,735 --> 00:20:35,279
Pull the key down and hear random grains from all over that waveform.

363
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:37,422
The source material is just a bunch of stone stuff, right?

364
00:20:37,742 --> 00:20:37,943
Easy.

365
00:20:42,188 --> 00:20:48,716
We have our various layers and a layer instrument at the top, so we can just play a single thing and it'll play all of them together.

366
00:20:59,045 --> 00:21:06,251
And now we're no longer in the place or in a position of dropping a shit ton of regions onto a Pro Tools or a Reaper timeline, we can just simply perform the Foley.

367
00:21:19,681 --> 00:21:20,141
Sick, right?

368
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:20,742
So cool.

369
00:21:22,904 --> 00:21:26,226
And if you're curious how I filmed that, not a GoPro, it was a phone and a shoelace.

370
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:27,007
That was what I did.

371
00:21:33,346 --> 00:21:35,508
Metal Impact Variations the Easy Way

372
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,334
The blue region here is a single variation.

373
00:21:43,354 --> 00:21:45,755
The top bin is like the reflect sound.

374
00:21:45,995 --> 00:21:50,157
It plays on a bunch of stuff in the game, but the blue one is the metal part, the big tuning fork specifically.

375
00:21:50,778 --> 00:21:55,440
I put two little parameters in this event, and it's randomEqNotch, randomEqPeak.

376
00:21:56,101 --> 00:22:01,904
We put them at 0.5 and randomize their value 100%, so it goes either 0 to 1 every time the event plays.

377
00:22:02,604 --> 00:22:08,548
And then we tie those two to EQ positions on this multiband EQ.

378
00:22:09,008 --> 00:22:09,268
Here it is.

379
00:22:13,337 --> 00:22:13,637
Maybe?

380
00:22:14,998 --> 00:22:15,339
There it is.

381
00:22:15,639 --> 00:22:15,899
What the?

382
00:22:18,641 --> 00:22:19,462
It's not there, apparently.

383
00:22:19,522 --> 00:22:20,602
Well, it sounds sweet, I promise you.

384
00:22:20,622 --> 00:22:22,624
Here we go.

385
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,453
I'd be sad if the highly edited video didn't play.

386
00:22:40,834 --> 00:22:43,956
Okay, so next is the void strength effect.

387
00:22:45,177 --> 00:22:47,699
Okay, so void strength is tied to various things in game.

388
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,822
In this case, proximity to these strange crystals, yeah?

389
00:22:54,185 --> 00:22:56,407
There's enemy attacks and stuff also in the game too.

390
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:58,028
We hear the same sound.

391
00:23:02,232 --> 00:23:03,353
So the source here,

392
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:08,913
to start things out was a main theme of the game's soundtrack, the title theme.

393
00:23:09,573 --> 00:23:11,094
And it's the random knob, yeah, let's go.

394
00:23:14,155 --> 00:23:18,296
And what we were going for in game, hopefully, was like downsampling it.

395
00:23:19,437 --> 00:23:20,097
That was the ambition.

396
00:23:24,239 --> 00:23:24,919
So that was the aim.

397
00:23:25,879 --> 00:23:30,880
But unfortunately, FMOD doesn't have native bit crushing.

398
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,881
I did find this weird free thing online.

399
00:23:33,981 --> 00:23:36,641
It was free, so it's always kind of sketchy to put in a commercial project.

400
00:23:37,141 --> 00:23:40,582
And also there was no Xbox libraries or anything else anyways, so it's kind of a moot point.

401
00:23:40,622 --> 00:23:44,223
So back to the drawing board, I considered making a bunch of just baked loops.

402
00:23:44,343 --> 00:23:46,343
Here's different values of bit crushed whatever.

403
00:23:46,863 --> 00:23:50,824
But the thing about downsampling is it's really obvious when you swap across different levels.

404
00:23:50,844 --> 00:23:53,705
You're gonna get the stair casing effect for sure, so that's not gonna work.

405
00:23:54,345 --> 00:24:05,581
So back to the drawing board again, instead I thought perhaps a random square wave LFO, in particular these two knobs, the base level and the volume, it's like a range so you can move the knob and it'll change to suit.

406
00:24:05,841 --> 00:24:08,425
What we're talking about is randomization within a range over time.

407
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:13,487
So we're going to have five baked loops, let's say across the void strength as it increases.

408
00:24:14,307 --> 00:24:17,568
We won't have this static set of loops where you're going to be staircasing so horribly.

409
00:24:17,628 --> 00:24:18,788
We'll have this instead.

410
00:24:19,188 --> 00:24:23,989
And now we have this expression over time as opposed to just these hard stairs.

411
00:24:24,009 --> 00:24:26,409
We have access to way more nuance as you do in game.

412
00:24:27,069 --> 00:24:29,570
So here's loosely what it looks like in action in FL.

413
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:45,424
With me so far.

414
00:24:45,865 --> 00:24:47,186
We're like half with your void strength.

415
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:47,946
So it's going to keep going.

416
00:24:48,166 --> 00:24:48,367
Okay.

417
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:57,734
So, but first, before you go forwards, the goal of what we're doing here is to make it seem like the in-game content is being bit crushed.

418
00:24:57,754 --> 00:24:58,775
Like it's being down sampled.

419
00:24:58,795 --> 00:25:00,096
We can't do it actually.

420
00:25:00,576 --> 00:25:01,257
So we need to fake it.

421
00:25:01,817 --> 00:25:07,562
So to make it seem like we are, we consider when you down sample anything, it's the top most frequencies that are affected first.

422
00:25:07,602 --> 00:25:07,782
Yeah.

423
00:25:08,043 --> 00:25:08,523
So it goes like,

424
00:25:08,885 --> 00:25:12,789
These tickle of changes top to bottom as you crank up the downsampling.

425
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:17,414
So the thing is with that, it leaves unaffected frequency range beneath it.

426
00:25:17,554 --> 00:25:20,757
It's kind of just like this wave traveling as you crank the knob up.

427
00:25:21,338 --> 00:25:22,979
So we want to have two things in-game.

428
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:31,008
We have the progressively low-passed game audio, which is like the unaffected stuff underneath we're faking, and the bit-crushy downsampled stuff on top of it, okay?

429
00:25:31,548 --> 00:25:31,808
Here it is.

430
00:25:32,169 --> 00:25:33,149
So here's the event in Fmod.

431
00:25:33,309 --> 00:25:35,150
We're looping on silence because the event's always playing.

432
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:37,072
Various things in the game cause void strength to take place.

433
00:25:37,592 --> 00:25:40,274
And here's the void strength parameter timeline.

434
00:25:40,734 --> 00:25:45,437
We don't hear anything at first because we don't want to have anything happen until some void strength is in effect at least.

435
00:25:46,197 --> 00:25:47,438
So we'll get some reference audio going.

436
00:25:47,898 --> 00:25:48,899
We have two snapshots.

437
00:25:48,939 --> 00:25:49,759
The first is part one.

438
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:50,920
The second is part two.

439
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,303
We crank to 100% over the first half for part one and then for part two.

440
00:25:57,615 --> 00:26:18,249
and part one is basically just a high shelf to make space for some for those down sampled highs it's not much happening so far just subtle and part two is a big old low pass and keep in mind we're again we're adding bitcrush stuff on top of this that's the most it'll get low pass to 100 again the goal to make it sound like the in-game audio is being distorted okay

441
00:26:19,764 --> 00:26:24,986
The second snapshot also bandpasses the in-game, like the gameplay sound effects, like Fox stuff and enemy stuff.

442
00:26:25,386 --> 00:26:29,627
We still kind of wanted to hear it, so we didn't want to cut it off entirely, like the music and ambience.

443
00:26:30,468 --> 00:26:32,748
So now, we'll get a reference sound effect going.

444
00:26:32,768 --> 00:26:36,290
It's that hit from earlier, yeah?

445
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:42,252
And we'll hear the kind of screaming sound design loop we put on top of the void strength down below.

446
00:26:55,523 --> 00:27:02,029
and we side-chained the SFX against the screen loop too.

447
00:27:07,373 --> 00:27:07,633
Cool?

448
00:27:07,914 --> 00:27:08,174
Alright.

449
00:27:10,036 --> 00:27:12,117
So, and for the Bitcrush loop specifically...

450
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:16,810
That's that nested event in that previous video, yeah?

451
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:22,933
So, as mentioned earlier, we're mixing the in-game audio with the Bitcrush stuff.

452
00:27:22,953 --> 00:27:24,474
So we're high-passing this.

453
00:27:24,894 --> 00:27:27,135
All we want is the tickles, right?

454
00:27:27,155 --> 00:27:29,356
We don't want all the main theme stuff underneath.

455
00:27:29,736 --> 00:27:35,179
So we have this high-passed Bitcrush content with the low-passed game audio, and we're sweeping both.

456
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:36,439
It all makes sense?

457
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,160
Because I had to relearn that.

458
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,980
So thank you for bearing with me.

459
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,761
I did it a long time ago.

460
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:45,462
Okay, next up, using game design to inform audio decisions.

461
00:27:46,923 --> 00:27:51,825
First up, first kind of umbrella of points, we're talking supporting the player's narrative.

462
00:27:52,005 --> 00:27:59,927
And what I mean by that is not necessarily like the narrative of the game, the story being told, but rather what's happening for this player specifically.

463
00:27:59,987 --> 00:28:01,908
What is their personal experience with the game?

464
00:28:02,287 --> 00:28:04,209
It could be there's a hallway and a door at the end.

465
00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:07,992
Well, did they just run down speed run style and like slam through it, like glitch through the wall?

466
00:28:08,593 --> 00:28:12,036
Or do they hang out for a while and like make a sandwich or talk to their wife or something?

467
00:28:12,296 --> 00:28:14,398
We need to make sure that both experiences are covered.

468
00:28:15,018 --> 00:28:19,382
So the, it all comes down to the choices they're making and the experience they're having as a result.

469
00:28:20,143 --> 00:28:23,225
So first thing here, it's really easy, real simple one, but checkpoints in music.

470
00:28:23,305 --> 00:28:31,170
For a long time, the checkpoints didn't reset the music and it just kept feeling kind of wrong because the world pauses, the whole world resets.

471
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,652
It makes sense to have the audio follow suit.

472
00:28:33,692 --> 00:28:33,872
Yeah.

473
00:28:42,185 --> 00:28:55,071
Antunic being a game where everything is hidden, or many things are hidden in plain sight, and you're not really told how the game works or where to go or anything, this had a bonus knock-on effect of kind of implying further what the checkpoints do and how they work, just through the audio alone.

474
00:28:56,431 --> 00:28:58,092
Next up, we're talking first sightings.

475
00:28:58,772 --> 00:29:01,674
The first time players hit something, regardless of when.

476
00:29:05,815 --> 00:29:06,896
Here's a big reveal right here.

477
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,260
Wow.

478
00:29:12,301 --> 00:29:12,401
Right?

479
00:29:12,421 --> 00:29:14,423
We're throwing a parameter down the timeline in the music track.

480
00:29:14,803 --> 00:29:15,644
It's not sound effects.

481
00:29:16,705 --> 00:29:17,606
Can you hear the same thing?

482
00:29:25,074 --> 00:29:25,855
Big reveals.

483
00:29:28,146 --> 00:29:31,107
So this is the void touched, we call it, under the hood in Unity.

484
00:29:31,787 --> 00:29:33,907
And this is the first hint of darkness in the game.

485
00:29:33,927 --> 00:29:36,207
It's mostly like a light, bouncy, colorful thing otherwise, right?

486
00:29:36,227 --> 00:29:37,648
So the player is like, oh, this is the game.

487
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:38,628
OK, I had no idea.

488
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:40,228
So this is a big moment.

489
00:29:40,368 --> 00:29:45,909
We wanted to make sure that the player was, their eyes were widening at the same rate the sound was increasing.

490
00:29:46,689 --> 00:29:48,569
So right there, gasp, oh my god, it's right there.

491
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:52,510
It's possible they can go back up the ladder, but it's unlikely, right?

492
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:53,330
They're going to keep coming down.

493
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:56,091
And next up, same thing for the fuse field.

494
00:29:56,191 --> 00:29:57,451
Oh my god, it's the thing.

495
00:29:58,386 --> 00:29:58,566
Easy.

496
00:29:59,467 --> 00:30:05,510
And similar situation with some secret rooms, the player could never discover this room potentially, or they could discover it immediately.

497
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:09,412
But regardless of when they get there, we want the music for that room to start when they get there.

498
00:30:09,852 --> 00:30:13,174
So when they arrive here, this trigger volume is like, hey, welcome to the room.

499
00:30:13,654 --> 00:30:14,194
Music start.

500
00:30:14,634 --> 00:30:18,977
And then if you leave and come back, it's going to crossfade in from where it started before, because they already know it exists.

501
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:21,298
So we're keeping track of what the player knows.

502
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:27,302
Okay, I'll write quick one here, but still kinda in first sightings.

503
00:30:27,322 --> 00:30:29,743
We're talking distant sound sources and massive spaces.

504
00:30:30,363 --> 00:30:34,666
So regardless of when the player arrives here, it's probably the first time they've been in such a massive space.

505
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:39,609
And we wanna simulate travel time through the air, just push it forward on the timeline a bit.

506
00:30:40,529 --> 00:30:41,670
All right, isn't that elegant?

507
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,851
It's like, here we go, done.

508
00:30:43,351 --> 00:30:44,612
Check it out, it's a bit subtle, but check it out.

509
00:30:57,608 --> 00:30:57,968
The Thunk.

510
00:31:03,191 --> 00:31:04,091
What a big space.

511
00:31:07,453 --> 00:31:09,894
Some streamer was like, wow, they did like the air travel time.

512
00:31:09,914 --> 00:31:11,275
I was like, fuck yeah, let's go.

513
00:31:12,535 --> 00:31:13,296
I totally heard it.

514
00:31:14,116 --> 00:31:14,356
OK.

515
00:31:15,597 --> 00:31:18,218
Next up, predicting and informing player behavior.

516
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:22,120
It's kind of the next category for game design, informing player, or audio decisions, sorry.

517
00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:27,583
So, first thing, this is something I like to call heavy discouragement.

518
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:37,309
The gist here in the quarry is you can travel down, and if you don't have a certain item, the void strength cranks up real quick, and it's just saying, hey player, maybe go somewhere else first.

519
00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:45,813
If they get that item, and they equip it, that negates the whole effect, they can see what they're doing, they don't have this thing screaming in their ears, and their health isn't gonna be drained to zero.

520
00:31:45,873 --> 00:31:47,794
It's like a pretty clear turn back now.

521
00:31:48,434 --> 00:31:49,495
It doesn't always work.

522
00:31:49,595 --> 00:31:50,916
Most people turn back, but not always.

523
00:31:58,486 --> 00:32:10,042
with this audio holy shit fuck it's not even tied up that was a bug

524
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:20,534
we shipped, when I made that whole voice strength effect I went through earlier, making it, I broke its connection to the volume sliders by accident and just never realized.

525
00:32:21,034 --> 00:32:24,295
But I kind of liked it because it was like you're going down and someone's like, oh, I gotta turn that sound down.

526
00:32:24,315 --> 00:32:26,176
It's like, no, don't turn it down, just go, like leave.

527
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:29,397
So yeah, we did fix it though in the end.

528
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:33,648
So next up in predicting player behavior, these wind chimes, this puzzle here.

529
00:32:34,349 --> 00:32:43,337
The gist here is the chimes play in pairs and the sequence of pairs that happens, it could be ascending or descending or simultaneous, consecutive, same note.

530
00:32:44,077 --> 00:32:46,740
The sequence indicates a D-pad input sequence.

531
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,041
and then you do the thing and you get a prize.

532
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:53,984
So another challenge though is that there's this waterfall here and it's real loud.

533
00:32:54,504 --> 00:33:00,567
So while this is kind of a nice accessibility thing anyways, we specifically put the ambient slider in for this puzzle.

534
00:33:01,008 --> 00:33:06,591
Because while the chimes are arguably an ambient effect, this is like a point source thing hanging out in the ambient space, right?

535
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:08,912
We put it on the sound effects slider.

536
00:33:09,852 --> 00:33:12,554
And in the end, we do want people to solve this stuff, right?

537
00:33:13,371 --> 00:33:14,111
Keeps not playing videos.

538
00:33:14,191 --> 00:33:14,512
It's like that.

539
00:33:14,652 --> 00:33:16,813
It was like a duh by itself.

540
00:33:17,233 --> 00:33:17,953
What does that mean?

541
00:33:19,494 --> 00:33:20,695
Let's, I wonder.

542
00:33:23,036 --> 00:33:25,617
Let me turn off ambience.

543
00:33:36,122 --> 00:33:37,023
Okay, that should be even optimal.

544
00:33:37,043 --> 00:33:37,843
Designed moment, right?

545
00:33:37,863 --> 00:33:37,963
Right.

546
00:33:39,164 --> 00:33:40,404
Down, left, right, up.

547
00:33:44,573 --> 00:33:46,717
We want him to solve it, right?

548
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,863
Just set things up to allow for it, that's all.

549
00:33:50,665 --> 00:33:55,315
So finally on player behavior, Sonic foreshadowing.

550
00:33:57,964 --> 00:34:01,686
For context, this concerns the moment right after the player saw this void touched from earlier.

551
00:34:02,967 --> 00:34:08,570
This is an open world game, it's a bit difficult to foreshadow things with audio if the player can just sort of go anywhere.

552
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:13,732
It can be done here and there, kinda, but it's a bit easier when it's like in front of them, they have to go forwards, yeah?

553
00:34:14,313 --> 00:34:16,654
So here, they must go forward.

554
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,562
We just don't want them feeling great about it, you know?

555
00:34:28,322 --> 00:34:31,364
They've already been kind of unsettled from seeing that dark thing upstairs.

556
00:34:31,404 --> 00:34:32,785
They've gone down this elevator.

557
00:34:32,805 --> 00:34:33,505
It was real slow.

558
00:34:33,565 --> 00:34:36,827
We're just guaranteeing that they do hear this sound, right?

559
00:34:37,148 --> 00:34:38,869
In this case, we had a mono and stereo pair.

560
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:44,392
The mono pair and stereo pair have, or stereo effect, have different spatialization settings.

561
00:34:45,012 --> 00:34:50,656
And like I was saying, it just guarantees that we can like crank this up when they're far away and pull it down when they're close to have the direct sound instead.

562
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:54,991
I don't like that sound.

563
00:34:57,653 --> 00:34:58,554
What are those noises?

564
00:35:03,919 --> 00:35:05,160
Oh no.

565
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:08,303
What the hell is that noise?

566
00:35:15,829 --> 00:35:17,431
That's a rare spawn animation, you got it.

567
00:35:18,652 --> 00:35:19,453
And not once, twice!

568
00:35:27,455 --> 00:35:27,895
That was great.

569
00:35:28,756 --> 00:35:35,100
Okay, so the first, I'm sorry, final category here in game design informing audio is serving design pillars.

570
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:40,783
Game design pillars, the first being here, hidden in plain sight, we're doing spectrogram content.

571
00:35:42,164 --> 00:35:49,608
So consistent with the creative direction of hidden in plain sight, we want to have things a player might not ever know about.

572
00:35:51,729 --> 00:35:52,530
Here's the shopkeeper.

573
00:35:57,151 --> 00:35:58,012
room sounds like nothing.

574
00:35:58,032 --> 00:35:58,972
Again it can sound like anything.

575
00:35:59,393 --> 00:36:01,374
That's the point of the audio direction.

576
00:36:02,234 --> 00:36:06,277
So this being the shopkeeper, here's the ambience track if you rip it from the game, just record the output.

577
00:36:06,977 --> 00:36:10,860
And there are little glyphs in there, like the ones that appear throughout the manual and stuff.

578
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,682
In this case, in the shop, this one means buy.

579
00:36:14,747 --> 00:36:23,709
there is a shop elsewhere, there's one shop like this, it's a special version, and in this case the shopkeeper's like, this one's on the house, have it, here take this manual page, it's all yours.

580
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:27,510
And here's that ambience track, and this one means free.

581
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:33,692
So we're nearing the end, last thing in design pillars, this is

582
00:36:35,049 --> 00:36:36,069
More hidden in plain sight.

583
00:36:36,089 --> 00:36:37,390
I'm not going to tell you what it is at first, though.

584
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:39,451
Some of you probably might know, but I'll just get into it, OK?

585
00:36:39,791 --> 00:36:40,271
Let's do this.

586
00:36:40,911 --> 00:36:42,832
So this is arguably the biggest secret in the game.

587
00:36:43,592 --> 00:36:44,653
Last chance to leave.

588
00:36:46,173 --> 00:36:46,453
OK.

589
00:36:47,233 --> 00:36:51,815
So one main goal of Tunic's overall design was to make it feel like the world's not for you.

590
00:36:51,855 --> 00:36:53,376
You find chests that are already open.

591
00:36:53,816 --> 00:36:54,956
You can't read the language.

592
00:36:55,396 --> 00:36:57,257
There's no clear path, no direction.

593
00:36:57,697 --> 00:36:58,618
You aren't the hero.

594
00:36:58,678 --> 00:36:59,518
That's the idea.

595
00:36:59,598 --> 00:37:04,540
You're just small and lost in a land of mysteries, many of which are hidden in plain sight, like I've been saying.

596
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:12,215
So Tunix glyph cipher for instance, you roll in here, you can't really read it, it's been since dubbed Trunik by our players.

597
00:37:12,735 --> 00:37:17,438
There's no expectation the player ever solve this, but if they want to take the time, the words are there.

598
00:37:18,158 --> 00:37:20,860
The garden path shortcuts, the secret controller inputs.

599
00:37:22,011 --> 00:37:24,733
the functionality of various items and props in the world.

600
00:37:25,193 --> 00:37:26,134
It's all there from the beginning.

601
00:37:26,775 --> 00:37:31,058
The player just might not yet possess the knowledge required to interact with it or understand it.

602
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:34,440
So Tunix audio design was aimed in that same direction.

603
00:37:35,161 --> 00:37:41,565
Early in development, we imagined the game having a voice of sorts, maybe like from us, the devs, or just from the game itself.

604
00:37:42,266 --> 00:37:44,708
But regardless, as a voice, the player wasn't equipped to interpret.

605
00:37:45,368 --> 00:37:47,090
So I designed a musical cipher.

606
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,212
It's heard throughout the entire game, and it's never acknowledged.

607
00:37:51,291 --> 00:37:51,992
But first, Shrewnik.

608
00:37:52,633 --> 00:37:56,056
So if you did take time to solve it, you'd find that it's phonetic in nature.

609
00:37:57,078 --> 00:38:00,141
Over the left you have no, then joy, pi, cheer.

610
00:38:01,102 --> 00:38:03,845
Here is a rundown, if you weren't aware.

611
00:38:04,346 --> 00:38:10,513
So a single character can be a single phonetic pair of consonant and vowel, or it can be by itself, just one part of those two things.

612
00:38:11,033 --> 00:38:14,795
The interior defines the consonant, the N part, N, of no.

613
00:38:15,415 --> 00:38:18,897
And the exterior is the vowel, in this case, O. So together we have no.

614
00:38:19,237 --> 00:38:20,338
But there's a little circle underneath.

615
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:22,499
You swap the constant vowel order.

616
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:24,239
Now it's vowel constant for own.

617
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:25,960
With me so far?

618
00:38:26,941 --> 00:38:27,181
Sweet.

619
00:38:29,076 --> 00:38:41,299
Deciphering this might eventually lead the player to discover the secrets of the final late game glyph tower, which upon solving leads the player to do you fear the eyes of the far shore dot co, a website.

620
00:38:41,859 --> 00:38:47,100
This is where we finally reveal the existence of the audio language, the musical cipher, kind of.

621
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,701
Downloading and viewing the website's audio and spectrogram view shows a series of glyphs.

622
00:38:53,720 --> 00:39:03,554
and importantly the audio track also features a series of musical arpeggios that occupy the same time space as the glyphs and correspond one-to-one in meaning.

623
00:39:04,055 --> 00:39:04,396
Have a listen.

624
00:39:40,475 --> 00:39:43,057
This is our musical cipher's Rosetta Stone.

625
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:51,083
Dubbed Tunic by our players, doesn't make things hard to communicate at all, it's fine, Tunic.

626
00:39:51,644 --> 00:39:54,326
This cipher is the same as Trunic in structure.

627
00:39:54,566 --> 00:39:56,147
It's like a sister language, sister cipher.

628
00:39:56,547 --> 00:40:01,531
So for Trunic, a given phoneme is defined by the presence or absence of lines within a glyph frame.

629
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:08,557
For Tunic, it's defined by the presence or absence of notes over two octaves of a pentatonic arpeggio.

630
00:40:10,267 --> 00:40:12,589
For trunic, we look at the internal and external components.

631
00:40:13,009 --> 00:40:17,592
For consonant and vowel, and for tunic, we're looking at the lower and upper ranges of notes.

632
00:40:18,153 --> 00:40:20,314
So I recognize we're getting into musical theory a bit here.

633
00:40:20,354 --> 00:40:25,478
It probably won't be a big deal for a lot of you, but I apologize to those who aren't as musically versed.

634
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:28,500
But here's the briefest tutorial for those who might be out of the loop.

635
00:40:29,341 --> 00:40:32,563
A musical chord is notes all at once, yeah?

636
00:40:33,404 --> 00:40:37,727
An arpeggio, they're broken out and played separately, often ascending or descending.

637
00:40:41,155 --> 00:40:42,256
That was the phone in the shoelace again.

638
00:40:44,037 --> 00:40:46,598
I designed TUNIC with numbered notation in mind.

639
00:40:47,078 --> 00:40:54,542
That is, considering notes as scale degrees, as numbers, as opposed to absolute pitches or note letters.

640
00:40:55,303 --> 00:40:58,985
So for a C major scale, we're looking at not C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C, but instead 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

641
00:41:01,686 --> 00:41:04,628
And to that end, I said it's a pentatonic arpeggio, so we have 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15.

642
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:14,513
The consonant is defined by the lower octave, and the vowel by the upper octave, the notes up top.

643
00:41:14,693 --> 00:41:18,475
And one phoneme in tunic is one arpeggio.

644
00:41:19,476 --> 00:41:24,858
One arpeggio can be a consonant sound, a vowel sound, or commonly, the two put together for one phonetic pair.

645
00:41:25,298 --> 00:41:31,141
So for example, no would be 1-2-6 for the n, and 9-12-13 for the o. Is that gonna go?

646
00:41:31,181 --> 00:41:35,403
Oh, you're not gonna hear it, cool.

647
00:41:36,885 --> 00:41:37,245
There we go.

648
00:41:37,365 --> 00:41:37,585
All right.

649
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:38,405
There it is.

650
00:41:39,806 --> 00:41:50,913
And by default, the phonetic pairs like in trunic are always constant vowel as an ascending arpeggio, but we can have a little circle underneath and have it vowel consonant instead with a descending arpeggio.

651
00:41:52,974 --> 00:41:54,255
Can we, please?

652
00:41:54,275 --> 00:41:54,555
Jeez.

653
00:41:57,219 --> 00:42:04,823
Okay, a pentatonic scale can be built starting from any note, any root note, and therefore tunic can be written in any key center.

654
00:42:05,003 --> 00:42:07,024
We can even follow along with chord changes.

655
00:42:07,585 --> 00:42:13,648
As long as all notes in a given arpeggio move together, it's still decipherable.

656
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:25,760
All right.

657
00:42:26,301 --> 00:42:28,983
So every constant includes a one as part of its encoding.

658
00:42:29,023 --> 00:42:34,027
And that's because all, all note numbers are derived relative to that root note.

659
00:42:34,288 --> 00:42:36,690
So if it's not there, it can get tough to know what you're looking at.

660
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:44,717
So for example, like the one, three, five, eight of guh there, if we kill the one, the three, five, eight becomes like one flat three flat six or something like that, you know?

661
00:42:45,858 --> 00:42:50,282
So, and then, yeah, notably for vowels alone, like ooh, we also use the one as a placeholder.

662
00:42:50,302 --> 00:42:51,783
We just say one and then go top right away.

663
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,865
And sometimes, we'd even have a descending arpeggio lead directly into an ascending arpeggio.

664
00:42:58,185 --> 00:43:03,290
And in this case, we might employ only a single one acting as kind of an apostrophe connecting the two phonemes.

665
00:43:04,672 --> 00:43:12,820
And furthermore, since we're working in terms of numbered notation, the cipher's design accommodates for all kinds of expressions of tonality.

666
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:21,850
All right.

667
00:43:22,631 --> 00:43:27,096
So major, minor, diminished, mixolydian, whatever you're writing in, it's all fair game.

668
00:43:27,136 --> 00:43:28,678
A flat five is still a five.

669
00:43:30,339 --> 00:43:33,182
Anyway, tuneic shows up all over the game.

670
00:43:33,342 --> 00:43:35,365
It's in UI sounds like when you start a new game.

671
00:43:49,895 --> 00:43:51,837
or when you hit the finish line in a speed run.

672
00:44:08,515 --> 00:44:10,758
It's an enemy sounds like this little probe guy.

673
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:21,340
or this spell being cast.

674
00:44:31,065 --> 00:44:32,706
Finding a secret directs your attention.

675
00:44:38,629 --> 00:44:42,891
And one of my favorites, this is a secret spell, leading the Fox to some secrets to be found.

676
00:44:53,444 --> 00:44:55,485
And of course, the door in the mountains.

677
00:45:09,251 --> 00:45:12,373
I like this one a lot, actually, because it's kind of unique across Tunic.

678
00:45:13,193 --> 00:45:14,974
All the top notes are the same.

679
00:45:15,494 --> 00:45:20,917
So as a result, the subsequent root note of each arpeggio kind of helped to inform what the chord changes would actually be.

680
00:45:20,937 --> 00:45:21,477
It's pretty cool.

681
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:30,534
Anyway, the cipher shows up all over the soundtrack as well, some three hours of music created by Terrence Lee and Janice Kwan.

682
00:45:31,355 --> 00:45:36,358
And for each track, I brainstormed secret lyrics of a sort with the primary developer, Andrew.

683
00:45:36,558 --> 00:45:43,122
These are words that were thematic or relevant in nature to each track's corresponding area or purpose, that kind of thing.

684
00:45:43,842 --> 00:45:46,904
So I'd make simple MIDI files for Terrence based on the words we selected.

685
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:55,092
it's in it's most simplest form, right?

686
00:45:55,272 --> 00:46:00,900
It's like kind of like Morse code, it has like a very simple minimal form, but you can, if you know you're listening to Morse code, you can like do anything.

687
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:01,581
I can do this.

688
00:46:02,422 --> 00:46:03,924
And you know, it's like dots and dashes, you know?

689
00:46:04,585 --> 00:46:06,988
So, and Terrence would then check my work.

690
00:46:07,309 --> 00:46:08,070
There's a misspelling.

691
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:08,991
Kevin, come on man.

692
00:46:09,472 --> 00:46:10,333
He got pretty good at this stuff.

693
00:46:12,441 --> 00:46:15,522
And then Terrence would create a track working around that MIDI content.

694
00:46:16,122 --> 00:46:19,523
And here's an example of what I workshopped with Andrew versus what Terrence produced.

695
00:46:19,683 --> 00:46:21,104
It's Under Earth, it says.

696
00:46:21,164 --> 00:46:27,025
In this case, Andrew and I actually had some other reference material from like Zelda or something that was like, let's try to make it kind of feel like this tonality.

697
00:46:27,065 --> 00:46:30,386
So I already had the tonality built in and sent it Terrence's way.

698
00:46:30,507 --> 00:46:31,567
So see if you can hear it, Under Earth.

699
00:46:38,289 --> 00:46:38,409
And

700
00:47:10,492 --> 00:47:11,333
And here's my favorite.

701
00:47:12,474 --> 00:47:19,761
The game was called Secret Legend for a long time, and in fact, in the title of the game, it says Tunic with the glyphs above and below, that says Secret Legend 2.

702
00:47:20,701 --> 00:47:21,923
And here it is in the end credits.

703
00:47:39,019 --> 00:47:40,340
So I know what you're all thinking.

704
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:41,800
Why?

705
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:45,902
Why do all this fucking work?

706
00:47:45,982 --> 00:47:46,862
It's so much work.

707
00:47:48,063 --> 00:47:49,243
Why go to all this trouble?

708
00:47:50,323 --> 00:48:01,728
Well, apart from following suit with the secrets everywhere in plain sight kind of direction of the game, our dev team had a little phrase we employed throughout development, and that was content for no one.

709
00:48:04,246 --> 00:48:14,550
We use that phrase to refer to little or large things that we hid deeply in the game, very deeply in the game, for no other reason than we just liked making it, and we liked knowing it was there.

710
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:16,531
Will anyone ever find it?

711
00:48:16,751 --> 00:48:17,351
Will they find it?

712
00:48:17,551 --> 00:48:19,852
Maybe, maybe not, but either way, it's totally fine, it's okay.

713
00:48:21,032 --> 00:48:30,696
And by the way, if all this talk of musical ciphers tuned to the music has you wondering, yes, this is a large reason why we called the game Tunic.

714
00:48:33,561 --> 00:48:34,161
So that was a lot.

715
00:48:35,923 --> 00:48:39,185
Hope it was helpful and inspiring and interesting and entertaining.

716
00:48:39,505 --> 00:48:40,325
I'm not sure, hopefully.

717
00:48:40,706 --> 00:48:44,028
But if you want to see more of Tunic, we're in the IGF booth until tomorrow at three.

718
00:48:44,808 --> 00:48:45,809
And thanks a lot.

719
00:49:05,745 --> 00:49:06,066
Thank you.

720
00:49:06,947 --> 00:49:08,329
Also, I wasn't sure if I'd have time for this.

721
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:14,079
This is a bonus video of the source material for the Slarm enemy's voice.

722
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,220
Thank you, Isla, the dog.

723
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:35,560
Yeah.

724
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:37,001
She just had some salmon or something.

725
00:49:37,021 --> 00:49:38,841
And that was, yeah, I heard across the room.

726
00:49:38,981 --> 00:49:40,602
It was like, Oh my God, I got my H6.

727
00:49:41,422 --> 00:49:41,662
Okay.

728
00:49:42,742 --> 00:49:42,942
All right.

729
00:49:42,982 --> 00:49:43,102
Yeah.

730
00:49:43,142 --> 00:49:45,063
So please fill out your evals.

731
00:49:45,123 --> 00:49:47,103
Of course, everyone's saying that just please do.

732
00:49:47,163 --> 00:49:48,183
It helps me improve.

733
00:49:48,203 --> 00:49:49,224
It helps GDC improve.

734
00:49:49,244 --> 00:49:49,924
It's super helpful.

735
00:49:50,664 --> 00:49:54,905
And, uh, I thought this would be like right to the hour, but that's fucking much fast.

736
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:55,425
That was sick.

737
00:49:55,865 --> 00:49:57,005
So I'm available right now.

738
00:49:57,045 --> 00:49:58,246
Any questions, please.

739
00:49:58,286 --> 00:49:58,986
The mic's right there.

740
00:50:12,383 --> 00:50:12,723
Hello.

741
00:50:13,123 --> 00:50:14,224
Hi.

742
00:50:14,784 --> 00:50:26,029
In the lead up to release, Andrew Sholday said that his favorite sound was the lever puzzle activating.

743
00:50:26,909 --> 00:50:34,172
And when you were asked the same question, you said, that will have to be asked me after release.

744
00:50:34,572 --> 00:50:36,433
So now I'm asking you after release.

745
00:50:40,182 --> 00:50:43,885
Yeah, we kept that cipher pretty close to the chest.

746
00:50:44,765 --> 00:50:46,347
Not even like friendier for the most part.

747
00:50:46,367 --> 00:50:48,228
A lot of our indie pals around the industry.

748
00:50:49,729 --> 00:50:50,810
It's tough to pick one out.

749
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:52,832
The existence of this thing.

750
00:50:52,872 --> 00:50:57,415
I mean, we had to... I kind of skipped over this, but it's heavily implied.

751
00:50:57,476 --> 00:51:00,218
We did this before like any music was written.

752
00:51:00,478 --> 00:51:02,039
It was done so, so, so early.

753
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:06,603
So, I think the sound effects wise, I mean,

754
00:51:10,598 --> 00:51:14,541
I think that the secret, the fairies and their voices, oh you know what, I have an answer for you.

755
00:51:14,881 --> 00:51:23,988
So there's a waterfall and it's like a fairy fountain kind of room in the game and all the fairies you discover here and there with little secret inputs all end up there.

756
00:51:24,388 --> 00:51:31,854
And there's one fairy in that room that just sort of flies like to the group and all the other ones like fly into the sky and you just find the waterfall later.

757
00:51:32,434 --> 00:51:37,899
So I decided without telling Andrew to just make a special case fairy sound.

758
00:51:38,479 --> 00:51:40,062
So they don't say like, woo, hee, ha.

759
00:51:40,143 --> 00:51:41,265
They don't say, hey, I'm free.

760
00:51:41,285 --> 00:51:42,046
They don't say those things.

761
00:51:42,107 --> 00:51:43,770
He has like this very long...

762
00:51:45,780 --> 00:52:10,566
uh... like stand-up comic style routine is like roasting andrew and i mean a bit it was like it was a bad thing and i can go through and and making just a little or the lore of the game is tough and it's also pitch to the music over time it's like enough modding key with the music it's just it was way way too much work but uh... yet a search waterfall very fountain tunic i'm sure you hear online it's kinda ridiculous and totally unnecessary awesome thank you

763
00:52:13,123 --> 00:52:14,084
Hi, thank you for the talk.

764
00:52:14,244 --> 00:52:15,045
Cheers.

765
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:31,297
I'm a freelance game audio designer and one of the things I often find really hard and difficult to do is figuring out how much work a project will be and how much to charge for my services.

766
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:36,802
And so I'm wondering how you and how Power Up Audio does it with a project like this where there's

767
00:52:37,893 --> 00:52:44,096
so much more to just like per sound effect price, there's like so much design that goes on behind this.

768
00:52:44,156 --> 00:52:48,958
So how, if you can speak to that, that might be a subject for a whole nother talk.

769
00:52:49,038 --> 00:52:49,178
Yeah.

770
00:52:49,198 --> 00:52:51,340
What's the itemized invoice look like for this, right?

771
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,200
Yeah.

772
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:52,900
Okay.

773
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:57,903
So I can answer in vague terms, certainly.

774
00:52:58,123 --> 00:52:59,864
So PowerUp works in a variety of ways.

775
00:53:00,064 --> 00:53:03,265
We do hourly invoicing and we just like track our hours and charge monthly.

776
00:53:03,365 --> 00:53:04,786
We do lump sum payments over

777
00:53:05,219 --> 00:53:19,975
installments like you know now and beta and like a release date or something we do revenue share where it's more like a partnership we do like the game releases and like at certain milestones of profit we get a little bonus payout it's across the board but in general

778
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:29,715
For projects where we are diving into the trenches with the core development team, we definitely prefer to have some element of revenue share.

779
00:53:30,095 --> 00:53:31,076
It might not be all.

780
00:53:31,136 --> 00:53:33,238
It might be an advance plus some small percentage.

781
00:53:33,318 --> 00:53:34,178
It could be a variety of things.

782
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:40,162
But having more of a partnership-style agreement and relationship makes this make a lot more sense.

783
00:53:41,763 --> 00:53:44,465
I answered that question without telling you what the contract terms were for tuning.

784
00:53:44,505 --> 00:53:45,086
I hope that was good.

785
00:53:45,386 --> 00:53:45,506
Yeah.

786
00:53:49,844 --> 00:53:49,964
Hi.

787
00:53:50,184 --> 00:53:50,485
Thanks.

788
00:53:50,545 --> 00:53:51,226
Great talk, by the way.

789
00:53:51,266 --> 00:53:51,506
Cheers.

790
00:53:51,546 --> 00:53:52,347
Thank you.

791
00:53:53,088 --> 00:53:54,069
So I'm kind of new to audio.

792
00:53:54,169 --> 00:53:56,132
Basically, I did a lot of graphics work.

793
00:53:56,612 --> 00:54:01,919
And then accessibility talks got me really jazzed about, like, everyone needs to be able to, you know, audio is a big thing for some people.

794
00:54:03,087 --> 00:54:03,167
of

795
00:54:23,641 --> 00:54:32,108
How do you make sure that, like, what are the best techniques and the best things to, like, track down where I'm, like, I'm gonna get the most bang for my buck, even if they have, like, a junky audio.

796
00:54:32,368 --> 00:54:34,150
Like, no one gets audio, standalone audio cards.

797
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:41,796
Okay, so it seems that the question is about how do you ensure that the work you're doing, the mix you're preparing, is gonna translate across different systems?

798
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:42,917
Yes, thank you.

799
00:54:59,572 --> 00:55:07,179
it's important to, yeah, play your game on a laptop, play on your home theater system, play it like on your phone, play it with your, like plugged into your car speakers.

800
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:11,442
You can do any variety of things and it will, it will help you find like a good average.

801
00:55:11,462 --> 00:55:14,044
It may reveal things you didn't know that are problems.

802
00:55:14,445 --> 00:55:21,470
I mean, I'll hear work from up-and-comers, like students and such, and they'll have a big sound effect happens.

803
00:55:21,591 --> 00:55:24,013
It's like sub-bass, crazy thing.

804
00:55:24,733 --> 00:55:25,634
Up top, like some twinkly

805
00:55:26,054 --> 00:55:26,775
Chimes or something.

806
00:55:27,195 --> 00:55:28,557
I'm like yo if you're playing on a laptop.

807
00:55:28,837 --> 00:55:44,491
You're hearing the chimes only you're hearing no subs So so be aware of what you're designing some lows would be good some low mids probably to help I mean it sounds like you want to communicate some power if you put that in there also at least some and Yeah, that's the kind of problem that might be revealed if you play on like some shit system, right?

808
00:55:44,831 --> 00:55:46,493
Oh, is that adequate for response oh?

809
00:55:47,206 --> 00:55:48,267
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

810
00:55:48,407 --> 00:55:51,950
I didn't know if there's any other documentation or anything you knew of.

811
00:55:53,151 --> 00:55:56,454
Kind of like when, like graphics, you can just pull down the resolution.

812
00:55:57,055 --> 00:55:57,355
Oh, sure.

813
00:55:57,375 --> 00:55:58,636
You can design multiple textures.

814
00:55:58,696 --> 00:55:59,357
Just big crush it.

815
00:55:59,377 --> 00:56:01,659
Yeah, multiple textures, like high-end, low-end.

816
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:05,502
I didn't know if there's anything compatible with audio, or you just have to test things?

817
00:56:05,522 --> 00:56:06,583
It's not something we put in the game.

818
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,464
No, it's not like audio quality.

819
00:56:08,504 --> 00:56:08,805
Perfect.

820
00:56:09,105 --> 00:56:10,066
Yeah, I didn't know.

821
00:56:10,486 --> 00:56:10,987
Thank you so much.

822
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:11,327
Yeah, cheers.

823
00:56:13,493 --> 00:56:14,894
Hello, I'm Sabrina Fideli.

824
00:56:14,934 --> 00:56:16,775
Thank you for visiting my room.

825
00:56:17,275 --> 00:56:20,657
Hi, I had a question about your magic sounds in the game.

826
00:56:21,198 --> 00:56:26,361
So I noticed besides them being rounded, they had a lot of similar characteristics feeling very cool.

827
00:56:26,941 --> 00:56:29,323
He's like long reverb tails that shimmered.

828
00:56:30,423 --> 00:56:40,429
For someone who wants to incorporate those kinds of adjectives or warmth or coolness in their magic, what kind of steps you need to take to make sure you have that consistency?

829
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:42,571
I mean,

830
00:56:43,731 --> 00:56:48,997
I am pulling from similar VSTs is an easy start.

831
00:56:49,097 --> 00:56:53,361
Things like the EQ palette is important too, right?

832
00:56:53,381 --> 00:57:05,354
If you have something that has a certain kind of presence or ratio or whatever of highs versus lows or just areas of the frequency spectrum, that's kind of important to have it in the same neighborhood at least.

833
00:57:05,914 --> 00:57:17,536
the long tails and stuff is yeah again to be consistent with that direction of like smooth it out if it's just like a hard thing and stops that's a big jagged edge right so it smooths down just come down for a landing it's super easy

834
00:57:18,004 --> 00:57:18,965
as far as warmth and coolness.

835
00:57:18,985 --> 00:57:20,807
I mean, yeah, you're talking lows and highs, right?

836
00:57:20,827 --> 00:57:22,069
That's kind of, that's a very common thing.

837
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:23,450
Coolness.

838
00:57:23,791 --> 00:57:29,718
I mean, find anything that's like in a, in a, in a VST instrument, it's called like ice chimes or something like that.

839
00:57:30,438 --> 00:57:31,740
Like cool avalanche, whatever.

840
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,342
And it's all like super shimmery high stuff.

841
00:57:33,722 --> 00:57:36,986
Cause that's what we've come to associate with that kind of thing.

842
00:57:37,567 --> 00:57:37,787
Okay.

843
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:38,307
Thank you.

844
00:57:38,548 --> 00:57:38,728
Cheers.

845
00:57:42,764 --> 00:57:52,536
I feel like Tunic is an incredible example of what game development is, where nothing makes sense until it totally does.

846
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:59,044
In your realm, audio took such a big part in being at the forefront

847
00:57:59,544 --> 00:58:04,527
of kind of going through development, when usually audio is kind of at the back end, the tail end of things.

848
00:58:04,907 --> 00:58:18,293
And so do you think working on this game, kind of flipping it on its head, has changed the way that you are going to look at working in future projects, and how audio is going to be much more at the forefront of design, or has that always been at the forefront of your mind?

849
00:58:19,046 --> 00:58:26,372
Well always will be a generous word to use but I think a Decent way to answer that is that I came before power-up audio.

850
00:58:27,013 --> 00:58:28,594
I was at another third-party house.

851
00:58:28,794 --> 00:58:45,988
That was very service-oriented they're like they would never do revenue share ever be hilarious and you'd be left out of the room and It was like get it done throw it over the wall and never look back I'd find a problem with a game and like a bug in audio and I tell my boss He's like, ah, they paid don't worry about it.

852
00:58:46,008 --> 00:58:47,749
It was like it was terrible and

853
00:58:48,709 --> 00:58:54,172
Jeff and I formed PowerUp, and we wanted to kind of change how we operated in general.

854
00:58:54,772 --> 00:59:01,956
We didn't want to just be this last-ditch, last-minute-decision paint job on some mobile game like Clash of Whatever anymore.

855
00:59:02,556 --> 00:59:06,318
We wanted to be involved much early and be entrenched with developers.

856
00:59:06,859 --> 00:59:10,361
And even if we're not doing production early on, this is kind of a unique example, obviously.

857
00:59:11,505 --> 00:59:35,645
even if we're not making stuff right away, early on, we can at least be in those meetings, we can be apprised of the kind of systems they're developing, the direction the design is going in, and maybe we can pipe up and be like, oh, for audio, we could do something in like 12 months or whatever, but they can build it, they can accommodate for it right now, whereas if we're not in those meetings, and 12 months pass, and now we say, hey, can we do this cool thing in audio with the system you've done?

858
00:59:35,665 --> 00:59:37,367
They're like, oh, we have to tear it all down and do it over again.

859
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:38,468
No, absolutely not.

860
00:59:39,088 --> 00:59:48,411
So one thing I wanted to bring up I think really speaks to this particular project is this intersection between music background and sound design as a

861
01:00:00,137 --> 01:00:11,260
not a separate thing from music, but sort of as a partner to it because so much of the sound design for this game is musically informed and uses musical instruments and tools like the grain lights of VSTs and stuff like that.

862
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:24,023
The main question is, what is some advice you can give for students or those who are primarily composers that have apprehension about breaking into sound design as a discipline and may not feel like they have the chops to do it?

863
01:00:24,723 --> 01:00:32,308
Oh sure, I mean, I think in my experience, talking to students and such, that apprehension is often coming from a place of they don't want to, they want to do music only.

864
01:00:33,108 --> 01:00:35,710
And if that's the case, that's totally fine, you can do music only.

865
01:00:36,330 --> 01:00:37,811
And in fact, you probably should do music only.

866
01:00:38,131 --> 01:00:40,712
If you don't like doing sound, people are going to smell it.

867
01:00:40,892 --> 01:00:46,236
You know, they're going to be like, oh this, I mean, I'll play games, like yeah, this sound was definitely done by the composer and they probably didn't want to do the sound.

868
01:00:46,636 --> 01:00:47,977
And I'm often correct, you know.

869
01:00:48,937 --> 01:01:06,767
that said if you want to get if you do genuinely want to get into sound design I mean there's tons of things out there I mean watch real talk you know you can get some advice there there as far as I mean I am trained musically I mean obviously and I went to school for music composition I'm at a college you know I that was thing in film scoring for a long time

870
01:01:07,447 --> 01:01:09,148
and eventually I was like, yeah, sounds pretty cool though.

871
01:01:09,168 --> 01:01:11,149
I'm still using music all the time in my day-to-day.

872
01:01:11,369 --> 01:01:17,412
Even like a short, a sort of like shing, like that note of the ring out, it's got to be on the fifth, you know, like make it dominant.

873
01:01:17,432 --> 01:01:19,012
It's going to be better than like a tritone or something.

874
01:01:19,413 --> 01:01:22,514
It's the kind of thing that no one notices or like tweets me like

875
01:01:23,014 --> 01:01:25,616
props for, but I mean it's important to the mix, right?

876
01:01:26,156 --> 01:01:32,539
So if you're looking to break into sound design, like have that be a larger part of things, if it's genuinely interesting to you, then great, you have a great foundation.

877
01:01:32,579 --> 01:01:39,222
I mean, even when we're hiring a power-up, having a musical background is like the biggest plus on the consideration for it, you know?

878
01:01:39,643 --> 01:01:41,083
They gotta have some kind of background in music.

879
01:01:41,744 --> 01:01:42,264
Alright, thank you.

880
01:01:42,664 --> 01:01:43,084
Thanks, Skitch.

881
01:01:43,625 --> 01:01:44,505
I think we're out of time here.

882
01:01:44,605 --> 01:01:46,006
Please, E-Vals, yes?

883
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:49,888
Thank you so much.
