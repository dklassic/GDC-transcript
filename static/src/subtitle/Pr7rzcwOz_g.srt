1
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:12,132
I'm Victoria, and welcome to my talk about why fashion in most games sucks and why you

2
00:00:12,132 --> 00:00:13,432
should care.

3
00:00:13,432 --> 00:00:18,073
As far as I know, there haven't been any in-depth talks about fashion in GDC, so I'm trying

4
00:00:18,073 --> 00:00:21,234
to cram as much as I can in less than 30 minutes.

5
00:00:21,234 --> 00:00:25,856
So if you think I've skimmed over anything, please submit your own talks, do your own

6
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:28,216
discussions, contribute other things.

7
00:00:28,216 --> 00:00:33,238
I would love to just see more people talk about fashion in games, and I would totally

8
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:35,178
attend your GDC talk when you do it next year.

9
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,611
So, a little bit about me before we start.

10
00:00:39,611 --> 00:00:40,572
I'm Victoria.

11
00:00:40,572 --> 00:00:42,834
I'm the community developer at Kitfox Games.

12
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,075
A little bit more about that later.

13
00:00:45,075 --> 00:00:50,580
I previously worked on a ton of other games, maybe fashion related, maybe not fashion related,

14
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:55,203
things like Omensight, Leap of Faith, the mobile app episode, and more.

15
00:00:55,203 --> 00:00:59,046
I have been drinking a disgusting amount of bubble tea.

16
00:00:59,346 --> 00:01:02,689
And I don't know why I put that in there, I just thought it'd be cool.

17
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:06,713
And I'm also half of a game development culture comic called Peach Butt Comics, and that's

18
00:01:06,713 --> 00:01:06,974
on Twitter.

19
00:01:06,974 --> 00:01:08,475
You can also find me on Twitter, at the V-Tran.

20
00:01:08,475 --> 00:01:09,616
All my shenanigans there.

21
00:01:09,616 --> 00:01:09,997
Yeah.

22
00:01:09,997 --> 00:01:10,197
Thanks.

23
00:01:10,197 --> 00:01:10,978
Bye.

24
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:11,078
Bye.

25
00:01:11,078 --> 00:01:11,198
Bye.

26
00:01:11,198 --> 00:01:11,318
Bye.

27
00:01:11,318 --> 00:01:11,438
Bye.

28
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:11,518
Bye.

29
00:01:11,518 --> 00:01:11,638
Bye.

30
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:11,738
Bye.

31
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:11,879
Bye.

32
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:12,119
Bye.

33
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:13,060
Bye.

34
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:13,120
Bye.

35
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,180
Bye.

36
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:13,320
Bye.

37
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:13,460
Bye.

38
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:16,112
So a little bit about Kitfox.

39
00:01:16,112 --> 00:01:20,175
Kitfox is a small independent studio in Montreal, Canada.

40
00:01:20,175 --> 00:01:22,377
We're a team of eight.

41
00:01:22,377 --> 00:01:25,959
We do a bunch of things, but our most well-known

42
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:28,261
developed game that's out so far is called Moon Hunters.

43
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:30,643
It's a personality test RPG.

44
00:01:30,643 --> 00:01:32,824
We're currently developing a game called Boyfriend Dungeon,

45
00:01:32,824 --> 00:01:35,286
which is a dating simulator, dungeon crawler mashup.

46
00:01:37,608 --> 00:01:38,849
Yes, it's beautiful.

47
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,851
Please look it up.

48
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:43,594
And we are also publishing two games, which is really exciting.

49
00:01:43,594 --> 00:01:45,535
We're publishing them to Steam.

50
00:01:45,535 --> 00:01:50,680
One is Six Ages, which is the spiritual successor to King of Dragon Pass, and we're also publishing

51
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,623
the legendary Dwarf Fortress to Steam, which is very exciting.

52
00:01:55,204 --> 00:01:59,307
But yeah, but we're here to talk about fashion and briefly I wanted to talk about why I thought

53
00:01:59,307 --> 00:02:04,070
it was a worthy topic, though obviously if you are all here you probably think so too.

54
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:08,473
But when I was a teen I was one of those really annoying kids that was determined not to be

55
00:02:08,473 --> 00:02:09,274
one of those girls.

56
00:02:09,274 --> 00:02:13,577
I thought makeup was dumb, I thought caring about your looks was dumb, anyone who cared

57
00:02:13,577 --> 00:02:14,858
about their hair was dumb, you know.

58
00:02:14,858 --> 00:02:18,160
It was a bad time, we all judged teenage Victoria.

59
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,382
Cool, cool, okay, good, we're moving on.

60
00:02:21,382 --> 00:02:27,006
But secretly, hours were sunk into playing every single Roy World game, the My Scene

61
00:02:27,006 --> 00:02:34,472
games online, the Barbie games online, DollMakers, what a time, yes, thank you!

62
00:02:34,472 --> 00:02:34,952
What a...

63
00:02:34,952 --> 00:02:36,233
Oh my gosh, I...

64
00:02:36,233 --> 00:02:37,614
Look, okay, I'm not going to get into it.

65
00:02:39,098 --> 00:02:40,239
But I love dress-up games.

66
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,199
I love them so much.

67
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,140
And I hid it because I thought it seemed like a weird, girly

68
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,281
thing I shouldn't be caught doing.

69
00:02:46,281 --> 00:02:49,642
And it wasn't cool in my mind for the reasons

70
00:02:49,642 --> 00:02:51,803
that I feel a lot of people have told me about,

71
00:02:51,803 --> 00:02:54,584
which was there's a lot of games out there that are like, yeah,

72
00:02:54,584 --> 00:02:57,825
shooting and steel and e-sports and whatever.

73
00:02:57,825 --> 00:02:59,126
OK, that didn't exist back then.

74
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:02,167
But anyways, in reality, though, it

75
00:03:02,167 --> 00:03:05,188
was a way for me to frame my perception of myself

76
00:03:05,188 --> 00:03:07,128
and how I wanted to appear to the world and why.

77
00:03:07,529 --> 00:03:11,371
And I feel somewhere along the way, when these games were kind of popular,

78
00:03:11,371 --> 00:03:13,112
we lost them, like, all too soon.

79
00:03:13,112 --> 00:03:19,297
So, right now, games have typically been stuck in two major ways of thinking about play.

80
00:03:19,297 --> 00:03:21,178
Domination and force.

81
00:03:21,178 --> 00:03:26,162
What I think fashion does for games is that it breathes in the power of expression and aesthetics.

82
00:03:26,162 --> 00:03:29,204
How it explores a different type of play and how that affects players.

83
00:03:30,448 --> 00:03:33,650
So I want to quickly go through a few definitions,

84
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,932
just to clarify some things.

85
00:03:35,932 --> 00:03:39,275
I'm not here to necessarily talk about what good fashion is.

86
00:03:39,275 --> 00:03:43,198
I think that's not a really accurate description of fashion.

87
00:03:43,198 --> 00:03:45,220
But I want to talk more about how we've ignored it

88
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,682
as a serious mechanic or information-rich piece

89
00:03:47,682 --> 00:03:49,343
of storytelling.

90
00:03:49,343 --> 00:03:52,766
And fashion isn't just clothes.

91
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,067
This is clothes, and this is fashion.

92
00:03:56,271 --> 00:03:58,354
And fashion doesn't mean high fashion, right?

93
00:03:58,354 --> 00:04:01,218
Like all of this technically counts as fashion.

94
00:04:01,218 --> 00:04:04,243
I'm not here to talk about what good fashion is, again.

95
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:08,629
We're not all fashion designers, and I think that's okay.

96
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:09,491
You don't need to be one.

97
00:04:10,805 --> 00:04:13,965
Okay, so, now that I've got that out of the way,

98
00:04:13,965 --> 00:04:15,806
one question I got when I told people

99
00:04:15,806 --> 00:04:18,346
I was doing a talk about fashion was why.

100
00:04:18,346 --> 00:04:20,987
And I get it, but the reasons you should care about fashion

101
00:04:20,987 --> 00:04:23,408
is actually the reason it usually sucks.

102
00:04:23,408 --> 00:04:26,068
So Bill Cunningham, once a fashion columnist

103
00:04:26,068 --> 00:04:27,469
for the New York Times, said that,

104
00:04:27,469 --> 00:04:29,309
fashion is the armor to survive

105
00:04:29,309 --> 00:04:31,490
the reality of everyday life.

106
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,730
And I think that applies both online and offline.

107
00:04:34,712 --> 00:04:38,116
In a real life context, fashion matters more than you think.

108
00:04:38,116 --> 00:04:39,997
Even if you think you don't care,

109
00:04:39,997 --> 00:04:41,839
they do have significance, right?

110
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,020
Like skin friendly.

111
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,162
I would like all my clothes to be skin friendly.

112
00:04:45,162 --> 00:04:47,104
I don't know what that means, but I want it to be.

113
00:04:48,763 --> 00:04:54,047
But I get it, you know, caring about clothes can sometimes seem really superficial.

114
00:04:54,047 --> 00:04:59,991
Great games continue and do exist and become hits without runway looks, and that's fine.

115
00:04:59,991 --> 00:05:04,955
But I think we should consider new possibilities in games, and why limit ourselves when games

116
00:05:04,955 --> 00:05:07,077
are one of the most exciting mediums out there.

117
00:05:07,077 --> 00:05:11,900
All right, so, before I get to my first point, pretend you're meeting this person for the

118
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,261
first time, bam.

119
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:15,300
Yes.

120
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,961
Okay.

121
00:05:16,961 --> 00:05:22,504
So if you don't know who that is, which maybe I should have picked a less well-known character,

122
00:05:22,504 --> 00:05:25,785
what opinions have you formed from that brief meeting?

123
00:05:25,785 --> 00:05:26,105
Right?

124
00:05:26,105 --> 00:05:29,707
So it only takes about two seconds to form an opinion on a person or character.

125
00:05:29,707 --> 00:05:31,948
And you can get a lot of information from it.

126
00:05:31,948 --> 00:05:36,211
Age, sex, socioeconomic status, occupation, personality, and so on.

127
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:42,112
It's the first impression, and to be honest, it's usually flawed, but it's unavoidable

128
00:05:42,112 --> 00:05:43,152
nevertheless.

129
00:05:43,152 --> 00:05:46,873
So, for example, regardless if you knew this character or not, you can probably tell she's

130
00:05:46,873 --> 00:05:52,014
a doctor from the white coat, except she isn't a doctor you're normally used to because her

131
00:05:52,014 --> 00:05:53,835
shoes are a little bit off.

132
00:05:53,835 --> 00:05:56,115
It's very stylish, but not really a doctor thing.

133
00:05:56,115 --> 00:06:02,116
The black dress, also kind of strange for a doctor, and of course the accessories.

134
00:06:02,116 --> 00:06:05,137
So you're getting like a very rebellious vibe about her.

135
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:08,570
Then this other character gives us a very different message.

136
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,971
Sir, she's probably a student judging from the skirt,

137
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,312
but the fact she's covered in tights and a turtleneck

138
00:06:13,312 --> 00:06:16,013
means she might be more conservative

139
00:06:16,013 --> 00:06:18,294
or obeys dress code, if there is one.

140
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:22,006
So fashion can be seen as its own complex language.

141
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,567
It's codified, it's meaningful, it's symbolic,

142
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:26,368
with different contexts and moods.

143
00:06:26,368 --> 00:06:28,709
So the first reason we should care about it

144
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:32,210
is that fashion really increases our understanding.

145
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,691
Like, it can call back a certain era

146
00:06:33,691 --> 00:06:34,871
that you want to draw attention to,

147
00:06:34,871 --> 00:06:36,532
describe the setting it's in,

148
00:06:36,532 --> 00:06:39,273
make or break the lands that you've made.

149
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,533
It can send different signals,

150
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,234
deepen understanding of your world

151
00:06:42,234 --> 00:06:45,155
without having to rely on walls and walls and walls of text,

152
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,775
which I honestly hate in games.

153
00:06:47,315 --> 00:06:49,777
And it can say, like, where is your character from?

154
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:51,057
What happened in their past?

155
00:06:51,057 --> 00:06:53,178
If they've made it, what are they doing now?

156
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:55,459
How do you denote a villain versus a hero?

157
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:59,461
What if you use clothes as an indication of something meaningful, like a festival or a

158
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:00,261
culture?

159
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:02,002
Or a beloved childhood shirt?

160
00:07:02,002 --> 00:07:03,683
How can you basically tell their story?

161
00:07:03,683 --> 00:07:08,305
Clothes are clues to tell your players how to feel about characters, so you need to maximize

162
00:07:08,305 --> 00:07:08,825
your two seconds.

163
00:07:08,825 --> 00:07:14,808
And when things go right, you create a world that is deeper and connects more with your

164
00:07:14,808 --> 00:07:15,728
player, basically.

165
00:07:16,587 --> 00:07:21,352
So when it goes wrong is when your fashion kind of lacks context.

166
00:07:21,352 --> 00:07:23,734
In other words, it's meaningless.

167
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:25,796
To me, a lot of fashion in games falls under this.

168
00:07:25,796 --> 00:07:29,320
They don't bring anything to the games, and they don't make your character significant

169
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,842
in design or feel.

170
00:07:30,842 --> 00:07:33,685
In other words, it's information poor fashion.

171
00:07:33,685 --> 00:07:36,307
They're the kind of the moments that make you go like, what happened here?

172
00:07:36,307 --> 00:07:37,268
Like in this next slide.

173
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:45,153
I've practiced this talk for so long and I still can't figure out what it is.

174
00:07:45,153 --> 00:07:48,075
So if you don't know, Rex here is a diver.

175
00:07:48,075 --> 00:07:49,637
It doesn't look like a diving outfit, right?

176
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:55,361
If I didn't tell you this, you can't get any sense of what this character is.

177
00:07:55,361 --> 00:08:02,707
So again, it's not even necessarily that it's bad with its weird boots and shorts and whatever

178
00:08:02,707 --> 00:08:03,968
else there is.

179
00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:06,189
But it's that it doesn't tell you really anything about it.

180
00:08:06,942 --> 00:08:08,622
Same for Jill Valentine.

181
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:13,183
So she's supposed to be a cop, and I know it's kind of an old game, but she's the main

182
00:08:13,183 --> 00:08:15,404
character, but she doesn't look like one.

183
00:08:15,404 --> 00:08:17,444
She's not memorable in any way.

184
00:08:17,444 --> 00:08:21,385
And also, just as a personal thing, tube tops fall down.

185
00:08:21,385 --> 00:08:22,145
Not fun.

186
00:08:22,145 --> 00:08:23,566
Not a good outfit for zombies.

187
00:08:23,566 --> 00:08:27,967
And then this is not the outfit you would expect post-apocalyptic.

188
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:33,929
And I understand it's themed, but if I took this completely out of context and showed

189
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:35,869
it to someone, it doesn't make any sense.

190
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:41,370
Excuse this bad photo of my sim that I took, couldn't find it anywhere else.

191
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:45,371
But one of the things that really bothered me was in The Sims 3, which is supposed to

192
00:08:45,371 --> 00:08:49,913
emulate real life, I didn't find fashion outfits that worked with me, or that I thought I would

193
00:08:49,913 --> 00:08:55,334
actually wear, which seems strange for a game, and again made it sort of pointless.

194
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,755
And of course, I have to include something from Final Fantasy.

195
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,976
Here, the princess is a particular pain point for me

196
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:03,936
because her design could be good,

197
00:09:03,936 --> 00:09:05,877
but she's like wearing a pink plastic napkin,

198
00:09:05,877 --> 00:09:08,757
and it's like a blue belt from the 2000s,

199
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:12,938
and it almost works for the character class she is

200
00:09:12,938 --> 00:09:14,539
and what world she's in,

201
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:17,380
but it just kind of breaks you out of the world,

202
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,400
and it's like you hate consistency.

203
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,220
It's strange.

204
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:25,764
But even if we ignore how bad fashion provides nothing in games that they are part of, it

205
00:09:25,764 --> 00:09:27,104
also takes away from it.

206
00:09:27,104 --> 00:09:30,846
In fact, they might counteract the mood or feel of the game, providing a really jarring

207
00:09:30,846 --> 00:09:31,927
experience.

208
00:09:31,927 --> 00:09:36,129
Like, there's been numerous times where I've had boss fights and I've been wearing a ridiculous

209
00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:41,953
costume and it didn't give me that kind of deep sense of doom or anticipation because

210
00:09:41,953 --> 00:09:45,515
I was wearing, I don't know, a chef's outfit, but there was no pants.

211
00:09:45,515 --> 00:09:46,435
I don't know.

212
00:09:46,435 --> 00:09:46,795
Anyways.

213
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:53,214
So my next point has to do with how game and fashion has real world meaning, whether it's

214
00:09:53,214 --> 00:09:53,975
internal or external.

215
00:09:53,975 --> 00:09:59,801
Fashion is personal expression and that expression has both individual and communal power.

216
00:10:00,754 --> 00:10:02,835
So here's a study from Quantric Foundry,

217
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:04,796
who interviewed gamers about their primary gaming

218
00:10:04,796 --> 00:10:05,937
motivations.

219
00:10:05,937 --> 00:10:08,178
You'll see that for both women and non-binary people,

220
00:10:08,178 --> 00:10:11,680
fantasy plays a huge role in what games they choose to play.

221
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,043
Fantasy here is defined as being someone or somewhere else,

222
00:10:16,043 --> 00:10:19,145
and I argue fashion plays a huge role in this.

223
00:10:19,145 --> 00:10:21,726
And FYI for men, fantasy is the fourth highest motivation.

224
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,740
And this makes sense, right?

225
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,122
You want to feel connected to the character you play,

226
00:10:26,122 --> 00:10:28,143
the role you're in, whatever you're doing.

227
00:10:28,143 --> 00:10:30,024
You want to be able to express who you are

228
00:10:30,024 --> 00:10:32,505
or who you want to be in a fantasy context,

229
00:10:32,505 --> 00:10:34,526
even if you're not playing yourself necessarily.

230
00:10:35,952 --> 00:10:38,134
Obviously this applies to many different games.

231
00:10:38,134 --> 00:10:40,196
Like Halo Reach's customization was wonderful,

232
00:10:40,196 --> 00:10:42,398
where you could customize each piece of armor.

233
00:10:42,398 --> 00:10:44,400
And when people first saw a peek at Halo 5,

234
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:49,544
they kind of hated it, or what I saw they hated it.

235
00:10:49,544 --> 00:10:52,046
It kind of looked like a plastic recoloring

236
00:10:52,046 --> 00:10:53,608
of various armor sets.

237
00:10:53,608 --> 00:10:56,090
And you want to feel powerful in these games, right?

238
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,731
You want to feel like you're the best

239
00:10:57,731 --> 00:11:00,094
at shooting things, I suppose.

240
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:01,154
And close capture that.

241
00:11:01,154 --> 00:11:02,796
It matters to any type of gamer.

242
00:11:03,991 --> 00:11:07,413
And personally, it has an effect on self-expression.

243
00:11:07,413 --> 00:11:10,375
For me, when I was too afraid to wear sexy outfits,

244
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:11,716
I would kind of wear them in games

245
00:11:11,716 --> 00:11:13,257
to explore how they made me feel.

246
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:14,618
Did I actually like this?

247
00:11:14,618 --> 00:11:16,459
Did I want to dress more cute?

248
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:18,981
Did I like more masculine clothes?

249
00:11:18,981 --> 00:11:21,022
And did that make me feel more comfortable?

250
00:11:21,022 --> 00:11:23,384
It's a powerful feeling that fashion gives.

251
00:11:23,384 --> 00:11:25,425
And dressing up a character helps you aspire

252
00:11:25,425 --> 00:11:26,726
to something personally.

253
00:11:26,726 --> 00:11:28,247
They give you a mission and incentive

254
00:11:28,247 --> 00:11:30,769
to explore that feeling off screen if you choose to.

255
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:35,875
So the personal aspect of fashion can go terribly awry

256
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,137
because it is so personal.

257
00:11:38,137 --> 00:11:39,859
Due to the cultural meaning,

258
00:11:39,859 --> 00:11:41,540
it's easy to mess it up sometimes,

259
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,102
even more so because the industry

260
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:44,884
doesn't talk about clothes much.

261
00:11:44,884 --> 00:11:47,146
So I don't necessarily think misuse of clothes

262
00:11:47,146 --> 00:11:49,668
comes from an ill-attentioned or harmful mindset,

263
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:52,031
but if we're talking about why clothes matters,

264
00:11:52,031 --> 00:11:52,511
can't ignore it.

265
00:11:57,438 --> 00:11:57,959
Yeah.

266
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:03,480
So of course I have to talk about sexualized fashion.

267
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,020
I've come to actually have very complicated feelings about it

268
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:09,321
by now, and I recommend reading Maddie Meyer's fantastic piece

269
00:12:09,321 --> 00:12:12,702
about the inexplicable sexiness of Ivy Valentine on Kotaku.

270
00:12:12,702 --> 00:12:15,803
As she writes, these outfits don't directly

271
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:17,903
tell us anything about the characters wearing them.

272
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,884
Sometimes they contradict the stories and personalities

273
00:12:20,884 --> 00:12:22,204
of the women in them.

274
00:12:22,204 --> 00:12:24,004
And this is true, and I'd love to see games move away

275
00:12:24,004 --> 00:12:24,845
from this.

276
00:12:25,477 --> 00:12:27,878
She does mention reclaiming sexiness for ourselves,

277
00:12:27,878 --> 00:12:32,579
though I find the problem with this is that it's hard to feel empowered when

278
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:34,639
this is your option, or whatever else, right?

279
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,581
It's clear when a male character gets a perfectly acceptable costume for

280
00:12:39,581 --> 00:12:43,722
the context they're in, while the female one is wearing the coverage equivalent of

281
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:45,582
a band-aid, or a belt, I guess, in this case.

282
00:12:46,606 --> 00:12:48,946
To be clear, sexiness isn't inherently bad,

283
00:12:48,946 --> 00:12:52,367
but that doesn't mean it has to be used all the time,

284
00:12:52,367 --> 00:12:54,567
or that it has to be used at all, right?

285
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:57,128
It doesn't mean a sexy outfit is the only way

286
00:12:57,128 --> 00:12:59,828
to show female empowerment.

287
00:12:59,828 --> 00:13:02,129
I'm glad you're liking those.

288
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:05,710
It was a fun time looking them up.

289
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,890
Okay, so that's kind of like the sexiness

290
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,990
in terms of like self-expression.

291
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,731
But another thing that can go wrong

292
00:13:12,731 --> 00:13:16,091
is that I need you to first imagine this world with me.

293
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:20,932
So this is another way fashion can be misused.

294
00:13:20,932 --> 00:13:23,354
Imagine with me a new world for a second

295
00:13:23,354 --> 00:13:25,936
where Americans are only ever shown wearing Cameo

296
00:13:25,936 --> 00:13:28,198
or the US flag in all forms of media.

297
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:32,502
Fashion, TV, movies, games,

298
00:13:32,502 --> 00:13:34,083
you literally cannot do anything

299
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,665
without seeing an American wearing the flag.

300
00:13:36,665 --> 00:13:38,366
And work through this with me.

301
00:13:38,366 --> 00:13:39,868
It sounds funny right now,

302
00:13:39,868 --> 00:13:42,049
but after years of depiction,

303
00:13:42,049 --> 00:13:45,272
how bored, how annoyed, how dumb would this eventually look?

304
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:51,003
This is the simplest, most reductive way I can try to describe this and relate it to

305
00:13:51,003 --> 00:13:52,887
what I'm going to talk about.

306
00:13:52,887 --> 00:13:54,993
Clothes reflect culture and significance.

307
00:13:55,553 --> 00:14:00,375
Issues of cultural appropriation go far beyond the games industry and diversity,

308
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,916
but that doesn't mean we can't make a difference.

309
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:06,497
So get sensitivity readers, hire diverse people for your project.

310
00:14:06,497 --> 00:14:09,018
Video games can be fun and powerful.

311
00:14:09,018 --> 00:14:12,160
So I just really wanted to talk about this,

312
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,882
just using clothes as a means to really introduce your players or your fans

313
00:14:17,882 --> 00:14:22,704
to something new, to something way beyond what we can normally do.

314
00:14:23,975 --> 00:14:31,180
I really think that this makes a difference and I've seen a lot of things go wrong with it and

315
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:36,984
that's why I think a great example of using fashion for cultural understanding is the Geeky Bayou Project.

316
00:14:36,984 --> 00:14:43,970
This artist, Karis Locke, has been reimagining Southeast Asian garment design for various

317
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:48,133
movies and games. Her aim isn't to directly convert a character's

318
00:14:48,433 --> 00:14:51,313
clothing into local outfits, but to express their personality,

319
00:14:51,313 --> 00:14:54,694
their beliefs, and history using textiles, motifs,

320
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:55,714
and silhouettes.

321
00:14:55,714 --> 00:14:58,735
She mentions that when the characters from existing

322
00:14:58,735 --> 00:15:01,216
sci-fi and fantasy tales are interpreted

323
00:15:01,216 --> 00:15:03,296
through garments from the other side of the world,

324
00:15:03,296 --> 00:15:05,577
issues of race and culture often emerge

325
00:15:05,577 --> 00:15:08,777
because the people creating them aren't from the culture.

326
00:15:08,777 --> 00:15:10,958
And these designs are not only fun,

327
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,758
but they're a way to learn about the history

328
00:15:12,758 --> 00:15:16,039
behind traditional outfits, especially for Southeast Asia,

329
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:18,320
in this case, which is often forgotten about.

330
00:15:19,201 --> 00:15:22,605
In this way, again, clothes are significant.

331
00:15:22,605 --> 00:15:23,867
And it's still video games.

332
00:15:23,867 --> 00:15:24,828
You can still have fun.

333
00:15:24,828 --> 00:15:27,932
You can still credit people and have fun with it.

334
00:15:27,932 --> 00:15:31,597
And you're allowed to learn things from other people.

335
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,158
All right.

336
00:15:32,158 --> 00:15:33,240
So moving on.

337
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:36,704
Fashion is business and marketing.

338
00:15:36,704 --> 00:15:39,407
As a community manager, I'm always looking for something

339
00:15:39,407 --> 00:15:40,909
that can hook in players.

340
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:42,351
Hooks for video games are basically

341
00:15:42,351 --> 00:15:43,673
how you capture a player's attention

342
00:15:43,673 --> 00:15:46,696
and get them to want to learn more about your game.

343
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,258
And there's a lot of different kinds of things,

344
00:15:48,258 --> 00:15:50,541
like art, music, description,

345
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,683
but overall it's an emotional attachment,

346
00:15:52,683 --> 00:15:53,785
and fashion can do that.

347
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:57,691
For example, I've never wanted to play League of Legends.

348
00:15:57,691 --> 00:16:01,112
Then I started seeing pictures of this all over my Twitter timeline, and that's how I

349
00:16:01,112 --> 00:16:02,312
found the Popstar's music video.

350
00:16:02,312 --> 00:16:07,393
Unfortunately, I've heard the artist wasn't treated great, but at the time I legitimately

351
00:16:07,393 --> 00:16:12,154
spent an hour researching lore, KDA, and sent it to all of my friends.

352
00:16:12,154 --> 00:16:16,655
And if you want to speak in business terms, synergy and stocks and...

353
00:16:17,395 --> 00:16:20,357
profits and stuff, you can make lots of money on it, right?

354
00:16:20,357 --> 00:16:26,000
The strength you feel in video games makes you want to embody the heroes you see, whether

355
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,320
that's online or offline.

356
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,201
And fashion is one of the best ways to do that.

357
00:16:30,037 --> 00:16:32,159
And we want to get more physical about it.

358
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,960
Red Dead has a clothing line.

359
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,643
There's that cool thing between Final Fantasy and Louis Vuitton.

360
00:16:37,643 --> 00:16:38,804
But not even that.

361
00:16:38,804 --> 00:16:42,166
There's the whole thing about loot boxes

362
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,608
and Overwatch's massive financial success

363
00:16:44,608 --> 00:16:46,789
with seasonal skins.

364
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:49,051
I don't have time to get into the ethics of loot boxes,

365
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:50,172
so we're going to move on from that.

366
00:16:50,172 --> 00:16:53,254
But it's good business.

367
00:16:53,254 --> 00:16:56,076
And it sucks because I feel like there's

368
00:16:56,076 --> 00:16:57,597
no fashion games or mechanics.

369
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:03,634
There are so many different ways we have learned to shoot someone with various guns, and I'm

370
00:17:03,634 --> 00:17:08,557
confused as to why now fashion games are mainly hidden behind micro-transactions for mobile

371
00:17:08,557 --> 00:17:08,978
games.

372
00:17:08,978 --> 00:17:11,479
Which isn't to say they aren't fun, to be clear.

373
00:17:11,479 --> 00:17:13,101
But I'll talk about that later.

374
00:17:13,101 --> 00:17:16,243
Like there's not even a fashion game section on Steam.

375
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,144
I was trying to find some.

376
00:17:18,144 --> 00:17:19,205
Nothing comes up.

377
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:23,729
I'm just saying this is a whole market out there that someone can get in on.

378
00:17:23,729 --> 00:17:25,290
Just gonna go into that.

379
00:17:26,071 --> 00:17:30,675
But even Googling AAA shooters nets a ton of results on Google.

380
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:31,656
Fashion gets nothing.

381
00:17:31,656 --> 00:17:37,061
I was trying really hard to find some fashion games.

382
00:17:37,061 --> 00:17:43,107
And the ones that do show up are web-based, they're super old, or again, they're mobile.

383
00:17:44,102 --> 00:17:46,463
But if we're trying to talk about mobile fashion games

384
00:17:46,463 --> 00:17:48,465
and things that are done right, I

385
00:17:48,465 --> 00:17:50,526
do want to talk about Love Nikki.

386
00:17:50,526 --> 00:17:55,249
So Love Nikki has problems with its own depictions

387
00:17:55,249 --> 00:17:56,910
in certain respects.

388
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,513
But in another respect, it's highly appealing and complex

389
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:01,113
in its own way.

390
00:18:02,074 --> 00:18:06,939
Clothes can be obtained via story quests, drops, events, shops, and crafting.

391
00:18:06,939 --> 00:18:10,823
You can actually evolve your clothes, which is the most satisfying feeling to me.

392
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:15,067
You can get into style battles that kind of pit you against other players or AI.

393
00:18:15,067 --> 00:18:18,370
It's one of the most satisfying designs I've seen for fashion games, and I'd love to see

394
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:18,771
that more.

395
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:24,534
But where it really lacks in terms of fashion is AAA games.

396
00:18:24,534 --> 00:18:28,477
Sure, they're usually cosmetic, which I totally support, and it's totally fine, but that doesn't

397
00:18:28,477 --> 00:18:31,919
mean we're nearing a point where we can't do more with it, right?

398
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,241
Integrating clothes as an actual mechanic could create a whole new world of gameplay.

399
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:40,443
The Hitman series has been one of the nice exceptions to this, where Agent 47 can sneak

400
00:18:40,443 --> 00:18:42,965
across using different costumes.

401
00:18:42,965 --> 00:18:46,707
There's Yakuza 0's minigame, featuring the hostess makeovers and stats.

402
00:18:47,507 --> 00:18:52,570
But my point with this is that fashion games has been seen as a more feminine interest,

403
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:56,392
but I'd like to challenge that, much like how many people have said they're not interested

404
00:18:56,392 --> 00:19:01,415
in dating sims until Boyfriend Dungeon, that we could develop a fashion game that attracts tons

405
00:19:01,415 --> 00:19:07,098
of people and isn't hyper-focused on one gender. Bottom line, fashion is fun. And it's games,

406
00:19:07,098 --> 00:19:11,941
which is primarily fun. So they kind of just go together and it's beautiful and it's a marriage.

407
00:19:12,975 --> 00:19:16,136
So let's say you're just not stylistically minded,

408
00:19:16,136 --> 00:19:18,537
which is totally fine.

409
00:19:18,537 --> 00:19:21,399
I just wanted to recap kind of what we went over

410
00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:23,460
and also some things for improvement

411
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,421
that I've seen other people do or that we've done.

412
00:19:26,421 --> 00:19:29,163
So this is a recap for what games can do,

413
00:19:29,163 --> 00:19:30,563
what fashion can do for games.

414
00:19:30,563 --> 00:19:33,325
The three main reasons we talked about fashion

415
00:19:33,325 --> 00:19:35,306
is that it's informative, it's expressive,

416
00:19:35,306 --> 00:19:36,226
and provides fun.

417
00:19:36,226 --> 00:19:38,947
Keeping these in mind as you design characters,

418
00:19:38,947 --> 00:19:40,828
work on customization choices,

419
00:19:40,828 --> 00:19:42,049
or mechanics will help you.

420
00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:44,211
Think about what style brings to the table

421
00:19:44,211 --> 00:19:47,273
or how you want the player to feel in your game.

422
00:19:47,273 --> 00:19:50,316
So for example, this was the original design

423
00:19:50,316 --> 00:19:54,400
for one of the main dateable weapons in Boyfriend Dungeon.

424
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,582
Looking at this, what are his personality traits

425
00:19:57,582 --> 00:20:00,205
based on the clothes he wears?

426
00:20:00,205 --> 00:20:02,146
And once you kind of figure that out,

427
00:20:02,146 --> 00:20:03,507
this is his redesign.

428
00:20:03,968 --> 00:20:07,951
It's a very different feel, even just from this, right?

429
00:20:07,951 --> 00:20:11,054
So to kind of describe it, his original character direction

430
00:20:11,054 --> 00:20:14,577
was described as attractive, long hair, a little shallow,

431
00:20:14,577 --> 00:20:16,059
owns a nightclub.

432
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:18,061
And we knew he worked out a lot, so we kind of just

433
00:20:18,061 --> 00:20:19,762
gave him gym attire, because we were like,

434
00:20:19,762 --> 00:20:21,704
that's what people who work out wear.

435
00:20:24,206 --> 00:20:25,546
Please exercise, it's very healthy.

436
00:20:25,546 --> 00:20:30,947
But the problem with this is that it really gave the impression that his primary character

437
00:20:30,947 --> 00:20:32,088
trait was going to the gym.

438
00:20:32,088 --> 00:20:36,889
And maybe that's not very fashionable, especially if he owns a nightclub and kind of cares about

439
00:20:36,889 --> 00:20:37,809
that stuff.

440
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:42,290
So we revised it to be more in line with how we wanted the player to feel when they first

441
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:42,930
met him, right?

442
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:46,751
Like, how you feel when you first meet, like, the gym sunderer versus...

443
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,592
shirtless leather jacket sunderer is, you know,

444
00:20:49,592 --> 00:20:50,912
something different.

445
00:20:50,912 --> 00:20:52,613
We think the leather jacket sunderer

446
00:20:52,613 --> 00:20:55,294
is more brazenly flirty, he's confident

447
00:20:55,294 --> 00:20:57,615
and he's interested in you, and we think

448
00:20:57,615 --> 00:20:59,996
the new design is more effective at communicating that.

449
00:20:59,996 --> 00:21:03,577
So another game that kind of uses fashion

450
00:21:03,577 --> 00:21:07,458
as like a anchor is Monster Prom.

451
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,119
So I know there are two dating games,

452
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:11,600
but they're the two people that, I mean,

453
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,861
one is our game, Monster Prom, Dev,

454
00:21:13,861 --> 00:21:15,821
let me talk about his game, so thank you very much.

455
00:21:17,062 --> 00:21:20,345
But cheers to them for sharing their design info with me.

456
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:24,569
Monster Prom has wild humor and a fantasy monster theme,

457
00:21:24,569 --> 00:21:27,151
obviously, which is great, but their problem was that

458
00:21:27,151 --> 00:21:29,593
they still wanted it to feel grounded and real

459
00:21:29,593 --> 00:21:32,616
and close to young, millennial, everyday life.

460
00:21:32,616 --> 00:21:35,258
So how they did that was through fashion.

461
00:21:35,258 --> 00:21:37,080
It became their thematic anchor to really

462
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,622
ground people to the theme.

463
00:21:40,631 --> 00:21:42,793
And when you need to find style inspiration,

464
00:21:42,793 --> 00:21:43,414
where can you go?

465
00:21:43,414 --> 00:21:44,695
It's easy.

466
00:21:44,695 --> 00:21:46,236
There's a whole bunch of people out there

467
00:21:46,236 --> 00:21:48,038
showing their personal style,

468
00:21:48,038 --> 00:21:49,779
whether it's on Instagram, Pinterest,

469
00:21:49,779 --> 00:21:51,881
YouTube, Lookbook, et cetera.

470
00:21:51,881 --> 00:21:53,042
And you can improve, right?

471
00:21:53,042 --> 00:21:55,044
So the Monster Prom team realized

472
00:21:55,044 --> 00:21:56,725
the three girls were always wearing shorts

473
00:21:56,725 --> 00:21:58,147
or skirts or dresses.

474
00:21:58,147 --> 00:21:59,888
So it seemed like it was a bit limited

475
00:21:59,888 --> 00:22:01,009
in their fashion design.

476
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:03,952
So they challenged themselves to research good DLC outfits

477
00:22:03,952 --> 00:22:05,914
and that's kind of how we got into this.

478
00:22:07,116 --> 00:22:09,060
And there's other ways that you can do this, right?

479
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,188
I highly recommend one day just looking at.

480
00:22:13,555 --> 00:22:16,537
Fashion shows, it's great, they play around with themes,

481
00:22:16,537 --> 00:22:18,978
there's a treasure trove of inspirations.

482
00:22:18,978 --> 00:22:21,579
Pay attention and be curious about what certain clothes

483
00:22:21,579 --> 00:22:23,840
make the news, wonder what you can do about the world

484
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,081
of self-expression, personality, and culture,

485
00:22:26,081 --> 00:22:28,262
and find new ways to celebrate art.

486
00:22:28,262 --> 00:22:30,123
And of course, another way you can learn to integrate

487
00:22:30,123 --> 00:22:32,945
fashion to games is hire more diverse developers.

488
00:22:32,945 --> 00:22:35,026
More diverse team means more diverse options,

489
00:22:35,026 --> 00:22:36,686
ideas, and interests, which in turn

490
00:22:36,686 --> 00:22:38,968
attracts a more diverse audience.

491
00:22:39,852 --> 00:22:44,634
So again, overall to me, fashion is excitement

492
00:22:44,634 --> 00:22:48,477
found through exploration and self-discovery.

493
00:22:48,477 --> 00:22:51,679
It finds power in aesthetic appeal and fantasy

494
00:22:51,679 --> 00:23:06,007
and it's a whole new style of play worth doing well.

495
00:23:06,007 --> 00:23:06,828
Thanks. -. -. -. -. -. -. -. -. -. -. -. -. -. -. -. -. -.

496
00:23:07,298 --> 00:23:11,219
We have five minutes for questions.

497
00:23:11,219 --> 00:23:14,600
Please go to the mic and ask questions if you have them.

498
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:21,681
If not, I will be here.

499
00:23:21,681 --> 00:23:23,622
Sorry if that was not a normal photo.

500
00:23:23,622 --> 00:23:27,763
No questions.

501
00:23:27,763 --> 00:23:29,283
If you're shy, it's OK.

502
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:31,664
I will be here hanging out.

503
00:23:31,664 --> 00:23:36,305
Oh, is that?

504
00:23:36,305 --> 00:23:36,585
Hello.

505
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:39,536
Hello, I have a question.

506
00:23:39,536 --> 00:23:39,756
Yes.

507
00:23:39,756 --> 00:23:42,477
I was wondering what you think a good idea would

508
00:23:42,477 --> 00:23:47,619
be for starting fashion games right as far as body image

509
00:23:47,619 --> 00:23:50,240
goes, because obviously in the world of high fashion,

510
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,341
that is a lot of the place we could take inspiration from.

511
00:23:53,341 --> 00:23:54,861
It's dominated by a certain body type.

512
00:23:54,861 --> 00:23:56,942
And I was just wondering what your thoughts are on that.

513
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,751
Yeah, there's actually a lot of fashion designers now

514
00:23:59,751 --> 00:24:03,292
who have started to embrace more full-bodied figures,

515
00:24:03,292 --> 00:24:08,133
I suppose, and again, I would highly suggest

516
00:24:08,133 --> 00:24:11,614
looking on lookbook.new and Instagram,

517
00:24:11,614 --> 00:24:14,634
and there's so many fashion bloggers out there

518
00:24:14,634 --> 00:24:16,975
who just embrace whatever body type they have

519
00:24:16,975 --> 00:24:19,676
and don't fit whatever runway fashion,

520
00:24:19,676 --> 00:24:21,016
and you can learn a lot from them,

521
00:24:21,016 --> 00:24:22,216
and they are fantastic.

522
00:24:22,216 --> 00:24:23,116
I admire them.

523
00:24:23,116 --> 00:24:23,336
Thank you.

524
00:24:26,242 --> 00:24:33,608
Which is better, hiring a fashion advisor or designer learning fashion?

525
00:24:33,608 --> 00:24:36,270
Sorry, can you repeat that?

526
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:38,332
So which is better?

527
00:24:38,332 --> 00:24:43,836
So one option is hiring a fashion...

528
00:24:43,836 --> 00:24:44,217
Designer?

529
00:24:44,217 --> 00:24:44,697
Teacher.

530
00:24:44,697 --> 00:24:45,278
Okay, okay, yeah.

531
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:50,822
Or designer learning fashion, learning about fashion.

532
00:24:52,173 --> 00:24:53,014
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

533
00:24:53,014 --> 00:24:55,539
Oh, a game designer, sorry.

534
00:24:55,539 --> 00:24:59,706
Game designer learning about fashion?

535
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:00,648
Learning about fashion.

536
00:25:00,648 --> 00:25:03,333
Should you hire a fashion director or a game designer to learn the fashion?

537
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:03,653
Yeah.

538
00:25:04,329 --> 00:25:10,712
Oh, okay. I mean, honestly, to be completely honest with you, I don't know, because no,

539
00:25:10,712 --> 00:25:17,135
there's not enough games out there who have kind of maybe tried doing that. I think anyone can get

540
00:25:17,135 --> 00:25:22,337
into fashion or just dress or like learn about it if they're interested in it. So if you have

541
00:25:22,337 --> 00:25:26,319
someone who's interested in it and wants to learn more about it, I would say go with the game

542
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:28,840
designer who's interested in fashion. Thank you.

543
00:25:31,467 --> 00:25:37,018
Which roles on the team would you normally think would need this expertise?

544
00:25:37,018 --> 00:25:40,805
Like I said, artists, character designers, everybody?

545
00:25:41,451 --> 00:25:45,133
I mean, not everybody, but that'd be cool if they did.

546
00:25:45,133 --> 00:25:50,496
I think what usually I've seen is important is that our art director is quite interested

547
00:25:50,496 --> 00:25:54,258
in it, the creative director, the creative lead.

548
00:25:54,258 --> 00:25:58,180
And maybe this depends on each team because for Kit Fox we're quite small, so it's really

549
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,381
easy for us to communicate.

550
00:25:59,381 --> 00:26:04,483
And for me personally, I'm not technically a character designer, but I love fashion,

551
00:26:04,483 --> 00:26:07,365
so I'll look and I'll say how I feel about it.

552
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:09,646
But I would say probably at least the art director and the creative director.

553
00:26:09,646 --> 00:26:09,846
Thank you.

554
00:26:09,846 --> 00:26:10,006
Thank you.

555
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:19,785
You mentioned Overwatch, which is well known for its monetization being around skins.

556
00:26:19,785 --> 00:26:31,111
Do you think the monetization of skins and of fashion limits the players' ability to express themselves?

557
00:26:31,111 --> 00:26:33,573
Do you want to see less of that?

558
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:38,616
I mean, personally, I would like to see less of that.

559
00:26:38,616 --> 00:26:41,838
I just like customizing my character however I want.

560
00:26:41,838 --> 00:26:48,123
But there's so many layers to making money and profits and other things like that.

561
00:26:48,123 --> 00:26:49,384
Sorry, not a great answer.

562
00:26:49,944 --> 00:26:54,347
Anyways, personally I think it does kind of limit it.

563
00:26:54,347 --> 00:26:56,989
It gives you that rush, it gives you that excitement,

564
00:26:56,989 --> 00:27:00,771
but I kind of just wish that we didn't have loot boxes

565
00:27:00,771 --> 00:27:04,013
for customization, but that's a whole other thing

566
00:27:04,013 --> 00:27:05,994
that I can't do, but thank you.

567
00:27:05,994 --> 00:27:06,375
Hi there.

568
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:06,415
Hi.

569
00:27:06,415 --> 00:27:12,599
Something that I was curious to hear your thoughts on

570
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:15,580
is something that we see a lot in games

571
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,962
is future worlds being imagined,

572
00:27:17,962 --> 00:27:19,223
and some of them resulting.

573
00:27:19,593 --> 00:27:21,655
really interesting and unique fashions,

574
00:27:21,655 --> 00:27:25,559
like with things like deus ex and Detroit Become Human,

575
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:27,600
and others often not so much.

576
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,844
And I was curious on your thoughts on basically

577
00:27:31,844 --> 00:27:35,788
imagining future fashion and how to address that.

578
00:27:35,788 --> 00:27:37,190
Yeah, so there's...

579
00:27:37,996 --> 00:27:41,218
So much about fashion is drawing inspiration from different things.

580
00:27:41,218 --> 00:27:46,402
Like Deus Ex looked gorgeous because it almost looked like an Alexander McQueen runway.

581
00:27:46,402 --> 00:27:51,845
And there's fashion designers out there who basically create clothes that look super futuristic

582
00:27:51,845 --> 00:27:55,048
and kind of make worlds on their own with their clothes.

583
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:59,130
I would personally say if you're trying to create like a futuristic world and you're

584
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:02,433
not really sure how you want it to look, one, it's okay to make mistakes.

585
00:28:02,733 --> 00:28:04,574
Everyone makes mistakes.

586
00:28:04,574 --> 00:28:08,696
But two, just find those fashion designers.

587
00:28:08,696 --> 00:28:09,576
Find the inspirations.

588
00:28:09,576 --> 00:28:12,778
Find inspiration in anything, really,

589
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:15,980
that you can look around in.

590
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,041
But yeah, I think that's probably why.

591
00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:20,962
I just personally feel like when I

592
00:28:20,962 --> 00:28:23,243
saw the Deus Ex clothes in particular,

593
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,664
that it was just perfect.

594
00:28:24,664 --> 00:28:27,906
So do your research, I would say.

595
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:28,026
Cool.

596
00:28:28,026 --> 00:28:28,326
Thanks.

597
00:28:29,736 --> 00:28:36,038
Hi, how do you feel about the sort of balance between customization and immersion when it

598
00:28:36,038 --> 00:28:38,899
comes to creating worlds that have a specific look?

599
00:28:38,899 --> 00:28:46,642
And more importantly, showing gameplay through clothing, like does late game armor need to

600
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:50,603
look like late game armor or do you think that customization should be more important?

601
00:28:52,506 --> 00:28:54,088
So, I mean, it really depends.

602
00:28:54,088 --> 00:29:00,778
So I'm part of it is that I think it depends on the kind of game you want,

603
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:04,062
obviously, but it doesn't, I don't think it needs to really.

604
00:29:05,028 --> 00:29:10,070
look like late game armor if your game is basically...

605
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,331
So, okay, so let me try to frame this better.

606
00:29:12,331 --> 00:29:15,173
So if your game is like it's the end of the world

607
00:29:15,173 --> 00:29:16,833
and now your late game armor is like you

608
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:20,375
looking all badass, shooting stuff, I don't know,

609
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:22,896
then maybe, maybe that is what you want

610
00:29:22,896 --> 00:29:24,777
and you want to be able to customize it

611
00:29:24,777 --> 00:29:26,678
so that the player themselves feels like

612
00:29:26,678 --> 00:29:27,859
they're at their most powerful.

613
00:29:27,859 --> 00:29:31,140
I think that would be really important

614
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,561
and I've seen a lot of games like do immersion

615
00:29:33,561 --> 00:29:33,921
and

616
00:29:34,702 --> 00:29:36,103
customization together really well,

617
00:29:36,103 --> 00:29:38,424
and you would probably want to look into that.

618
00:29:38,424 --> 00:29:40,085
I can't really think of games now,

619
00:29:40,085 --> 00:29:42,086
but I'm gonna think about it and get back to you.

620
00:29:42,086 --> 00:29:44,928
Sorry, I'm gonna think about this.

621
00:29:44,928 --> 00:29:45,848
But yeah, sorry, thanks.

622
00:29:45,848 --> 00:29:46,108
What is it?

623
00:29:48,842 --> 00:29:56,309
I live in Japan and most of, I mean some of the games you show are from Japanese companies like Persona, Xenoblade and so on.

624
00:29:56,309 --> 00:30:02,536
And in Japan, yeah, we've got those games and there's the cosplay scenes and people go to cosplay shops and that's a huge thing.

625
00:30:02,536 --> 00:30:07,301
And they go to an anime convention and they buy some goodies. It's not just about games.

626
00:30:07,581 --> 00:30:11,924
but about like a world ecosystem and just the Lolita, I mean everything.

627
00:30:11,924 --> 00:30:14,626
And I would like to know what was the situation in North America?

628
00:30:14,626 --> 00:30:16,848
Is it just about like fashion in games?

629
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:23,273
Or is fashion also something that could build some bridges and links between, you know,

630
00:30:23,273 --> 00:30:26,215
I don't know, comics, anime, manga, everything, you know?

631
00:30:26,962 --> 00:30:32,005
So just to repeat your question, you're just asking if fashion can be a bridge between...

632
00:30:32,005 --> 00:30:38,169
Yeah, like cosplay, or I don't know, anime, not just games, you know, but like the whole ecosystem.

633
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:43,893
Yeah, yeah, I think like fashion is something offline and online, right, like that's why we

634
00:30:43,893 --> 00:30:47,775
love the merch, that's why we love the t-shirts, that's why we love dressing, like cosplaying and

635
00:30:47,775 --> 00:30:54,019
all that. So I think it can bridge understanding or just interests between people.

636
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,220
Thank you very much.

637
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:55,540
Thank you.

638
00:30:58,951 --> 00:31:07,359
Hi, I was wondering how you felt about certain pieces of clothing or armor being like attributed with stat boosts and how that affects the gameplay like how

639
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:13,785
Cuter clothes might have less effective defensive options and uglier ones have more effective

640
00:31:13,785 --> 00:31:17,088
I've been I've been in that boat before

641
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:27,835
Honestly, I don't want to say it's bad because I can see interesting things coming from it.

642
00:31:27,835 --> 00:31:35,121
But maybe, like in Diablo that I've played, you can customize how you want your clothes

643
00:31:35,121 --> 00:31:37,242
to look, Diablo 3 anyway.

644
00:31:37,242 --> 00:31:41,905
You can customize how your clothes look, even when you get the drops.

645
00:31:41,905 --> 00:31:43,747
I think that...

646
00:31:45,508 --> 00:31:51,191
It's difficult, but I don't mind stats being attributed to clothes,

647
00:31:51,191 --> 00:31:55,273
if that's important to you or if that's how you want to try to make your game.

648
00:31:55,273 --> 00:31:58,414
But I would love to still be able to customize it, again,

649
00:31:58,414 --> 00:32:02,556
because I think how the player feels in those clothes is really important.

650
00:32:02,556 --> 00:32:02,957
Thank you.

651
00:32:02,957 --> 00:32:07,459
Unfortunately, that's all the time we have.

652
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:09,780
We do have the breakout space across the hall,

653
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:12,061
if you would like to continue the conversation.

654
00:32:12,061 --> 00:32:12,341
Thanks.
