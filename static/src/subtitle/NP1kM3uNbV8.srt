00:00:17,352 --> 00:00:19,778
I'm Kieran O'Sullivan and this is Julian LalevÃ©.

2
00:00:20,299 --> 00:00:24,911
Together we'll be talking at GDC 2017 about the character pipeline and customization system

3
00:00:25,132 --> 00:00:26,034
of Far Cry Primal.

4
00:00:27,558 --> 00:00:33,162
In our presentation, we'll go through our new character pipeline, where our artists can seamlessly work on characters in both Max and Maya,

5
00:00:33,643 --> 00:00:36,705
and we'll explain how we wrote tools that can work in both software packages.

6
00:00:37,185 --> 00:00:41,529
The whole pipeline is integrated with our flexible character customization system named Wolfskin,

7
00:00:42,029 --> 00:00:48,374
which we use in Max, Maya, and the game engine to assemble characters from different meshes, material properties, and other inputs,

8
00:00:48,735 --> 00:00:53,538
and use rules and solvers to allow advanced interaction between these components and to resolve conflicts.

9
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:00,227
We hope to see you at GDC 2017.
