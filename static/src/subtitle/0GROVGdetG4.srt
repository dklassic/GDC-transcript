1
00:00:05,952 --> 00:00:08,914
I wanted to start the presentation with a quote that I really like.

2
00:00:10,055 --> 00:00:16,579
The quote is, let us not act out of fear and misunderstanding, but out of values of inclusion,

3
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:21,363
diversity, and regardless of all, and regards to all that make our country great.

4
00:00:21,423 --> 00:00:23,565
And that was said by the Attorney General Loretta Lynch.

5
00:00:24,846 --> 00:00:30,270
She really did a lot to include people with disabilities, people of color, and really

6
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:34,573
tried to make sure that equality was the law of the land.

7
00:00:35,998 --> 00:00:41,002
My name is Mark Barlet. I'm the founder and executive director of the AbleGamers charity.

8
00:00:41,962 --> 00:00:46,425
And my name is Bill Curtis Davidson. I'm with a company called Level Access.

9
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:51,428
We provide ICT accessibility services in multiple industries.

10
00:00:51,548 --> 00:00:54,830
I'm a senior director of strategic consulting.

11
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,891
That sounds like a made up title.

12
00:00:59,032 --> 00:01:01,554
For those that don't know, the AbleGamers charity is a...

13
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:06,633
Charity that helps people with disabilities gain a greater quality of life using the awesome

14
00:01:06,653 --> 00:01:07,554
power of video games.

15
00:01:08,414 --> 00:01:09,636
Who here knows what video games are?

16
00:01:09,656 --> 00:01:10,476
Anyone?

17
00:01:11,357 --> 00:01:11,557
Good.

18
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:19,104
And level access, essentially, we are experts in ICT accessibility.

19
00:01:19,144 --> 00:01:24,229
We help write some of the standards around the world for web and other kinds of standards

20
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:25,991
for government authorities as well.

21
00:01:26,736 --> 00:01:32,379
We work in all industries. We have a voice of PWDs, or Persons with Disabilities.

22
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:38,001
We have a spot on the FCC Advisory Committee for Persons with Disabilities.

23
00:01:39,782 --> 00:01:45,665
Our representative Sam Yale was here earlier this week speaking on blind and low vision in gaming.

24
00:01:45,765 --> 00:01:52,748
So we are very connected with those authorities, but working really for companies who are working to comply.

25
00:01:56,863 --> 00:02:02,366
So basically, just to get the somewhat boring stuff out of the way, the legal stuff.

26
00:02:03,147 --> 00:02:04,787
First, what is CVAA?

27
00:02:04,807 --> 00:02:07,309
It really covers two key areas.

28
00:02:07,589 --> 00:02:16,653
One is communication services that are really about human-to-human, live or near-live, real-time communication.

29
00:02:17,134 --> 00:02:23,517
So it's not covering automated or bots communicating with humans or automated communication.

30
00:02:24,057 --> 00:02:26,538
It's really about humans communicating together.

31
00:02:27,093 --> 00:02:36,236
in any form. So think of text, text chat, messaging systems, video or voice chat over

32
00:02:36,276 --> 00:02:42,458
the internet, and then also video programming and any of the features that allow people

33
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:49,861
to access those features. So navigating to them, using them, getting the settings, anything

34
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:52,321
like that. So that's what CVA covers.

35
00:02:52,865 --> 00:02:54,466
And I really want to stress what he just said.

36
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:57,547
It's not just the communication, but CVA covers

37
00:02:58,047 --> 00:02:59,428
getting to the communication.

38
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:03,269
That's why you'll see some accessibility features being

39
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,891
added into consoles and stuff that don't obviously work with

40
00:03:06,931 --> 00:03:10,692
communication, because CVA actually covers the path to

41
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:11,993
that communication as well.

42
00:03:12,553 --> 00:03:15,234
Now, the CVAA actually has a really broad reach.

43
00:03:16,515 --> 00:03:20,096
Netflix was just sued under the CVAA, the first lawsuit,

44
00:03:20,456 --> 00:03:21,056
because they

45
00:03:21,724 --> 00:03:24,845
are in violation of something in their app

46
00:03:24,885 --> 00:03:26,886
where they can't communicate with customer service.

47
00:03:27,626 --> 00:03:34,869
So it's a pretty broad law, and it's written kind of vaguely.

48
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:36,990
And it's done, like, way on purpose.

49
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,931
From the video game perspective, they've

50
00:03:39,951 --> 00:03:43,453
broken video games down into three main chunks.

51
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,061
You have class one, and class one is the consoles.

52
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:49,802
These are the Playstations, the Xboxes, the Switches,

53
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,603
the Vitas, the Atari 2600s.

54
00:03:54,063 --> 00:03:55,384
I actually got an interesting question.

55
00:03:55,404 --> 00:03:58,025
You know, the Atari is re-releasing the Atari 2600

56
00:03:58,785 --> 00:04:00,525
as a reboot, and someone said,

57
00:04:00,545 --> 00:04:01,926
do you think that's covered under CVAA?

58
00:04:01,946 --> 00:04:04,226
And I'm like, we talked to nobody when we played that thing.

59
00:04:06,907 --> 00:04:09,488
The second one is class two,

60
00:04:09,568 --> 00:04:12,289
and this is video game distribution systems.

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:23,267
So this is your Steams, your Origins, your Apple App Stores, Google Play, how the video game gets to the console.

62
00:04:23,988 --> 00:04:31,433
And where I think most of you fall into place is the Class 3, and these are video game titles themselves.

63
00:04:33,134 --> 00:04:36,856
Now, just so you know, CVAA was actually passed in 2010.

64
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:43,463
It had a two-year implementation window, which means it went into effect in 2012.

65
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:48,247
Games had a waiver, and games were on a waiver for a really long time.

66
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:52,850
Now the Class 1 and 2 waiver expired in 2017.

67
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:57,713
For those that are aware, you've seen Xbox and PlayStation, you're seeing accessibility

68
00:04:57,753 --> 00:04:59,474
features being put into those consoles.

69
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:04,338
That was because, one, AbleGamers was pressuring them for years and years and years, but I

70
00:05:04,378 --> 00:05:07,660
think more importantly, and to be honest, it was because CVAA.

71
00:05:10,187 --> 00:05:17,389
So there is one more waiver. The ESA had one more waiver, and on New Year's Day 2019,

72
00:05:17,869 --> 00:05:24,951
all of video games is covered under CVAA. All of them. Now, there are some provisions around

73
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:32,374
grandfathering. So if your content is out before January 1st, 2019, then you don't have to be CVAA

74
00:05:32,414 --> 00:05:32,734
compliant.

75
00:05:38,334 --> 00:05:44,417
If you make small changes after this date, you do not have to be CVAA compliant.

76
00:05:44,857 --> 00:05:48,719
But if you make major changes, you fall into it.

77
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:51,240
What I would describe to that is, who here played World of Warcraft?

78
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,201
Yeah.

79
00:05:53,881 --> 00:06:00,704
So World of Warcraft, if it came out today, would not be CVAA, but Cataclysm coming out

80
00:06:00,964 --> 00:06:05,326
after January 1st would put all of World of Warcraft.

81
00:06:05,945 --> 00:06:10,867
under CVA because that was a major change to how the game mechanics worked.

82
00:06:12,508 --> 00:06:13,829
Will there be another extension?

83
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:14,509
No.

84
00:06:14,989 --> 00:06:22,533
The FCC was very clear that they had given us three extensions and they polled the industry,

85
00:06:22,593 --> 00:06:28,836
they talked to companies way bigger than probably most of us in the room here, and they all

86
00:06:28,876 --> 00:06:30,397
said no, one more waiver and we'll be good.

87
00:06:33,578 --> 00:06:33,718
So...

88
00:06:34,224 --> 00:06:36,545
What is the CBA actually requires?

89
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:41,528
So we've talked about what the scope of the coverage is, as we call it,

90
00:06:41,608 --> 00:06:44,350
the communication services and video programming.

91
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:48,672
We're really focused in games in communication services,

92
00:06:48,712 --> 00:06:52,314
and that's what the waiver was about that Mark just mentioned.

93
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:56,877
But let's talk about what happens in the phases of game dev.

94
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,698
First of all, in design.

95
00:07:00,265 --> 00:07:05,329
The FCC doesn't tell you how to do what I'm about to go over, it just says you must do

96
00:07:05,429 --> 00:07:05,869
it, right?

97
00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:13,315
So there's no format that is provided by the FCC that says do this exact thing.

98
00:07:13,795 --> 00:07:18,358
They just have things that should be done for record keeping and evidence that there's

99
00:07:18,558 --> 00:07:21,481
action in the space of what we're talking about.

100
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:26,244
So in the design phase, we're really looking at three key things.

101
00:07:26,764 --> 00:07:29,867
First of all, researching available solutions.

102
00:07:30,861 --> 00:07:39,005
How many of you have been reading some of the press this week about, you know, just from GA Conf or the game accessibility, of course, AbleGamers.

103
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:43,827
We've got a lot of dialogue going on which we're really excited about.

104
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:53,751
And so there's now a situation that did not exist so prevalently last few years where there's a lot of solutions, right, and ideas.

105
00:07:54,331 --> 00:07:57,012
So this is about looking at those solutions.

106
00:07:57,505 --> 00:08:02,648
Seeing what may work in your particular development scenario, your platform.

107
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:05,710
Keeping in mind that it's not just console.

108
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:08,411
This is all games that have ACS in them.

109
00:08:08,671 --> 00:08:13,094
Could be, you know, a desktop, a mobile, a console.

110
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:18,297
Now interestingly enough, if you do your own research and you decide to go to a third party

111
00:08:18,777 --> 00:08:25,441
to do that communication, then the CVA responsibilities are that of the third party, not you.

112
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:26,781
So that's something important to remember.

113
00:08:26,821 --> 00:08:27,282
So if you're...

114
00:08:27,922 --> 00:08:31,884
going to put up like a, you're going to, in your chat, you're really just secretly using

115
00:08:31,984 --> 00:08:32,404
Slack.

116
00:08:33,285 --> 00:08:33,785
Don't do that.

117
00:08:33,845 --> 00:08:37,448
But if you did, it would be Slacks would have the CVAA.

118
00:08:37,788 --> 00:08:42,411
You would have to still make sure that you had access to the Slack channel through your

119
00:08:42,431 --> 00:08:45,593
game, but the actual communication would fall on that third party.

120
00:08:46,173 --> 00:08:51,356
And it's important to note that all of those providers who provide advanced communications,

121
00:08:51,436 --> 00:08:56,620
Skype, Slack, all of these entities are complying with CVAA as well, right?

122
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,120
So it's not.

123
00:08:57,988 --> 00:09:03,990
But I've walked the expo floor and there's so many people on the expo floor that are selling middleware and bits and pieces.

124
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:10,173
So if you decide that's the route you're going to go for your communication you might want to say like, hey, is CVAA compliant?

125
00:09:12,254 --> 00:09:16,255
So other than that, of course, two other quick things.

126
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:19,236
First of all, zeroing in on what are the features.

127
00:09:19,617 --> 00:09:25,939
CVAA is written from a functional perspective, like the functionality of what we're talking about and its access path.

128
00:09:26,501 --> 00:09:31,345
So what we do a lot with our clients is we figure out, let's look across all your game titles,

129
00:09:31,885 --> 00:09:35,488
where is their advanced communication services exactly.

130
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:39,231
You've got to do that first and then you've got to look at what's the priority.

131
00:09:39,251 --> 00:09:44,335
You may have some priorities based on release dates, how major the release is, how minor.

132
00:09:44,355 --> 00:09:49,400
And then finally, last but not least, and we'll show an example, is design checklists.

133
00:09:50,251 --> 00:09:56,635
CVAA requires that during the design phase that accessibility is considered, during the design phase.

134
00:09:57,155 --> 00:10:01,498
That's pretty much what it says, right? Again, remember I said it doesn't tell you how to do that.

135
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:07,722
Well, how to do it, what we advise our clients, and partnering with AbleGamers,

136
00:10:07,802 --> 00:10:12,584
who has the includification guidelines some of you may be familiar with, hopefully.

137
00:10:13,805 --> 00:10:17,027
One of the things we do with our clients is something like what I'm showing here, which...

138
00:10:17,804 --> 00:10:22,925
is a spreadsheet. I know it looks like a little scary, but spreadsheets can be your friend

139
00:10:22,985 --> 00:10:29,027
because it provides a handy list of things that should be considered by functional needs.

140
00:10:29,067 --> 00:10:38,429
So think blind, low vision, mobility, also by categories. So like if you've got voice

141
00:10:38,489 --> 00:10:44,690
or video or text based chat or communication, you can filter this down. What's in my game,

142
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:45,050
right?

143
00:10:45,665 --> 00:10:48,546
And I can zero in exactly on what I should think about.

144
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:54,627
And this Excel is really just a breakdown of the includification guidelines in Excel-y business form.

145
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:57,508
Well, includification is in awesome reading form.

146
00:10:57,848 --> 00:10:59,249
Right, and it's prettier.

147
00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:02,210
includification.com if you want to get a copy of that.

148
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:09,492
And also just to point out, so the way these are used by teams, and I've worked with a number of them in our work from Level Access,

149
00:11:09,572 --> 00:11:11,972
is that you know, you fill this out.

150
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:15,313
You filter it down based on what you're doing in your title.

151
00:11:15,736 --> 00:11:19,078
And then on the right, you might see some blank cells if you can see the screen.

152
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:24,581
How am I actually dealing with the accessibility of those features that are in scope?

153
00:11:25,061 --> 00:11:26,862
So that's kind of the way it's supposed to be used.

154
00:11:27,282 --> 00:11:32,085
And you really kind of want to do something like this because at the end of the day, you

155
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:36,267
have to be able to show the FCC, and we'll get to exactly what you need to show them,

156
00:11:36,588 --> 00:11:39,309
that you're paying attention to it and trying.

157
00:11:43,377 --> 00:11:48,642
In development phase, so if you imagine having that checklist thought about and everyone's

158
00:11:48,682 --> 00:11:54,547
kind of got some sense of what they're zeroing in on, what they're maybe some solution ideas,

159
00:11:54,967 --> 00:11:58,790
what you'd be doing during development is actually following the best practices.

160
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:06,477
Of course, includification provides many examples of solutions and from different sources.

161
00:12:07,057 --> 00:12:10,760
So you're able to look at that as well as any other sources you have.

162
00:12:11,644 --> 00:12:17,166
And follow those best practices, not just for the advanced communication, but for the

163
00:12:17,387 --> 00:12:18,627
on-ramp, as we call it.

164
00:12:19,808 --> 00:12:25,591
And then, what not to be forgotten, and this is something that we say in the disability

165
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:27,932
community, nothing for us without us, right?

166
00:12:28,552 --> 00:12:33,955
You should engage, and we'll talk more about this later, you should engage people with

167
00:12:33,995 --> 00:12:39,898
disabilities, such as working with AbleGamers or other entities to make sure that your

168
00:12:40,512 --> 00:12:46,333
Verifying as you go along that this is really working for people with these different access

169
00:12:46,413 --> 00:12:46,693
needs.

170
00:12:46,893 --> 00:12:49,634
In fact, I think that's actually one of the requirements in the CDIS.

171
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:51,695
It is engaging with persons.

172
00:12:51,735 --> 00:12:53,095
Again, it doesn't tell you how to do it.

173
00:12:53,115 --> 00:12:55,016
It just says you should engage with them.

174
00:12:55,036 --> 00:12:55,536
That's right.

175
00:12:56,396 --> 00:12:58,177
Here's the one that everyone hates the most.

176
00:12:59,317 --> 00:13:01,658
Documentation.

177
00:13:02,438 --> 00:13:03,498
Not the fun part, right?

178
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,039
I love documentation.

179
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,039
I make a ton of money writing stuff down.

180
00:13:11,918 --> 00:13:15,561
We're starting to see some great examples here of what we're talking about.

181
00:13:15,601 --> 00:13:21,145
Now, some of you probably, if you've looked at the console space from the major console providers,

182
00:13:21,165 --> 00:13:26,049
you'll notice they're documenting how the console accessibility features work, right?

183
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,592
Even by disability type.

184
00:13:28,632 --> 00:13:34,917
So, if you're hearing impaired, how to turn on captions for video programming that's supported in a console.

185
00:13:35,757 --> 00:13:38,400
Similar idea here is you want to be able to have...

186
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:41,827
documentation by functional access need.

187
00:13:41,847 --> 00:13:45,690
Now I'm going to go back to the checklist we showed, the scary Excel sheet.

188
00:13:46,151 --> 00:13:49,193
Because that's aligned by functional need,

189
00:13:49,854 --> 00:13:55,078
one thing that we're able to do here is after you develop and you arrive at what you've actually done

190
00:13:55,558 --> 00:13:58,661
and how you've done it, you can use this filterable checklist to say,

191
00:13:58,701 --> 00:14:01,303
what are the features I've done by impairment?

192
00:14:01,783 --> 00:14:03,384
And so then you can document that.

193
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:08,188
So you keep selling that spreadsheet, but you're not going to give them a copy of it.

194
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:09,962
So now I'm going to have to make it.

195
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:20,465
One of the interesting avenues that you might not completely understand is your support channel is also covered under CVAA.

196
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:26,627
It is the ability for someone to communicate with you for support. That is communication.

197
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:32,569
Right. So this is called out in CVAA as well.

198
00:14:33,896 --> 00:14:38,580
Not only do you need to communicate those documented accessibility features I just talked

199
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:43,763
about, so think of it as creating the documents and then providing them, such as what you

200
00:14:43,803 --> 00:14:46,025
might provide on an accessibility portal.

201
00:14:47,046 --> 00:14:52,470
We have a great example of that from EA, accessibility portal, for example.

202
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:59,836
But then, moreover, if there's a question, and I might use that same example to point

203
00:14:59,956 --> 00:15:01,917
out that there's a way to contact someone.

204
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:09,066
at the game manufacturer or studio so that they can get the proper support.

205
00:15:09,686 --> 00:15:14,528
And then having, so having a point of contact, knowing how to communicate, how do people

206
00:15:14,568 --> 00:15:21,390
with disabilities reach you, you know, in a web form, live chat, those types, and make

207
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:27,532
sure live chat is accessible, right, because it itself is ACS, is communication services.

208
00:15:28,313 --> 00:15:30,773
I panicked for a second because it said 30 minutes up here.

209
00:15:31,619 --> 00:15:34,760
But I remember we turned the slideshow on as they were coming in.

210
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,840
So I was like, wait a second.

211
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,401
So.

212
00:15:41,822 --> 00:15:43,542
You owe a report to the FCC.

213
00:15:43,562 --> 00:15:47,723
I had to explain the joke to him this morning because he doesn't watch this.

214
00:15:48,683 --> 00:15:51,824
So you actually do owe something to the FCC.

215
00:15:53,124 --> 00:15:56,765
A simple form is due on April 1st of every year.

216
00:15:56,925 --> 00:15:59,346
And it's a really you have to go create an account that said.

217
00:15:59,807 --> 00:16:14,755
I'm a company. This is my FCC number. If you feel like you're covered under the CVAA, and then on April 1st, you have to fill out. It's a pretty small form. You can find it. I can send you a link if you send me an email later.

218
00:16:15,116 --> 00:16:18,578
But it's a real thing. It says you're doing it. You don't have to give them paperwork.

219
00:16:20,296 --> 00:16:24,099
It says that you're doing it, and what's really important here, and I really want to stress it, is

220
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:27,701
remember we've talked about the checklist, and remember, you know, I highly recommend

221
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:32,004
everyone who thinks they're covered under the CVAA to create a trunk on their website that's

222
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:38,629
like slash accessibility. You know, so if your game company dot com slash accessibility, because

223
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:45,013
what the FCC is going to do is not check up on you, but if someone complains that your game

224
00:16:45,273 --> 00:16:48,415
is covered under the CVAA and they don't have the information.

225
00:16:48,748 --> 00:16:50,290
They're going to open up an investigation.

226
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,472
If they start finding the checklist that you just

227
00:16:53,532 --> 00:16:55,733
kept in the folder, or you have it on Google Drive,

228
00:16:56,054 --> 00:16:57,735
and you have the accessibility portal that

229
00:16:57,775 --> 00:16:59,156
talks about your accessibility stuff,

230
00:16:59,456 --> 00:17:01,657
you might not ever know you were being investigated.

231
00:17:01,898 --> 00:17:02,798
Because they'll be like, no, they're

232
00:17:02,818 --> 00:17:03,879
doing what they're supposed to do.

233
00:17:04,379 --> 00:17:06,541
But if you are investigated, and you

234
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:10,003
didn't do any of these things, and you filled out

235
00:17:10,043 --> 00:17:11,464
that form that said you're complying,

236
00:17:11,885 --> 00:17:13,025
you can get in a lot of trouble.

237
00:17:13,862 --> 00:17:18,283
Well I should say that there's levels of, there's informal and then a formal process,

238
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:19,824
so just to temper that a little bit.

239
00:17:20,824 --> 00:17:26,826
Informal it would be just, you know, doing some quick checks if somehow they go and find

240
00:17:27,426 --> 00:17:33,808
that you've got accessibility information, or they, and really the reason for this certification

241
00:17:33,868 --> 00:17:35,769
form is to know who do I contact.

242
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:37,510
Right, so they'll contact you.

243
00:17:38,688 --> 00:17:42,090
before there's any formality to an investigation.

244
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:45,953
Actually FCC created a brand new process for this because they knew and so they have this

245
00:17:46,053 --> 00:17:51,998
informal 180 day thing and if at the end of the informal there is in fact a violation

246
00:17:52,098 --> 00:17:53,179
it kicks into the more.

247
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,363
So that's just to make sure you're clear that it's not immediately going to a more intense

248
00:18:00,064 --> 00:18:00,945
investigation.

249
00:18:01,285 --> 00:18:04,888
There's a period of dialogue and they really want to work with manufacturers to.

250
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:11,882
Find out, because everyone understands while there is a requirement, there's a process

251
00:18:12,403 --> 00:18:18,885
by which this has to happen and there may be something you're doing as evidence through

252
00:18:18,925 --> 00:18:23,486
your records that you can't do something right now but you're planning to do it in the next

253
00:18:23,566 --> 00:18:24,307
version, right?

254
00:18:24,727 --> 00:18:27,888
So that's reasonable and they'll work with you on that.

255
00:18:28,988 --> 00:18:31,789
And then if it becomes formal, that would be a different thing.

256
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:32,930
But they've actually had...

257
00:18:33,589 --> 00:18:39,513
And the CVA, so the person who helped spearhead the CVA through FCC was actually here on Monday,

258
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:45,658
and she said they've had 192 complaints and only one went formal.

259
00:18:46,178 --> 00:18:50,561
So she was talking very extensively about the process as really just to work with you

260
00:18:50,581 --> 00:18:52,643
to get it fixed, not work at it to fine you.

261
00:18:54,324 --> 00:18:54,564
Right.

262
00:18:54,724 --> 00:18:59,088
They want to encourage positive action with everyone involved, right?

263
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,840
Where did the little image guy go?

264
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,602
Oh, there he goes.

265
00:19:08,922 --> 00:19:09,802
So, how do you get there?

266
00:19:10,763 --> 00:19:18,045
So, a couple of key things, you probably heard themes in our presentation.

267
00:19:18,726 --> 00:19:24,588
There's a theme of engaging people with disabilities and knowing about these best practices.

268
00:19:24,828 --> 00:19:27,909
That's one thing that definitely is important.

269
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,590
And I'm delighted to be here with...

270
00:19:31,068 --> 00:19:38,172
We're really excited about our partnership with AbleGamers because there's a lot of competency

271
00:19:38,212 --> 00:19:43,316
about those practices, a lot of people with disabilities who want to be involved.

272
00:19:43,756 --> 00:19:46,098
So that's, you know, we want a couple of things.

273
00:19:46,178 --> 00:19:50,160
We want to get that engagement going and more fluid, right?

274
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:56,624
Use the ideas that are coming out in your colleagues' work as well, the creative solutions

275
00:19:56,644 --> 00:19:57,445
that are happening.

276
00:19:57,885 --> 00:19:58,105
And then...

277
00:19:58,732 --> 00:20:01,773
I'm kind of representing the business part of this, right?

278
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:05,194
The work I do when I said that word strategic consulting.

279
00:20:05,574 --> 00:20:06,315
What does that mean?

280
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,255
I work with companies to put the process in place, right?

281
00:20:09,716 --> 00:20:11,996
Because if you don't have a process

282
00:20:12,236 --> 00:20:14,457
and you're just doing this kind of in one title

283
00:20:14,517 --> 00:20:16,498
and then maybe another group and there's

284
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:18,858
no sharing of knowledge inside your company,

285
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:21,759
however small or large it is, then that's

286
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:22,780
not really efficient.

287
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:31,163
And moreover, if you do, you know, certify with the FCC that you're creating records, well, you really should have some kind of process.

288
00:20:31,884 --> 00:20:38,468
So, we've been working with game development as well as console providers to put that process in place.

289
00:20:39,209 --> 00:20:40,530
And it doesn't take a huge amount of effort.

290
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,051
It doesn't have to be a big process.

291
00:20:42,071 --> 00:20:42,191
Right.

292
00:20:42,211 --> 00:20:43,052
It just needs to say like...

293
00:20:43,072 --> 00:20:43,872
You have to have something.

294
00:20:44,112 --> 00:20:50,817
You know, stop for a second and go, does this have an accessibility ramification?

295
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,418
And just document...

296
00:20:53,186 --> 00:20:56,928
that you thought about it for a second and what your answer was and just keep that in

297
00:20:56,968 --> 00:20:57,548
your records.

298
00:20:58,148 --> 00:21:00,009
If the answer is yes, do something about it.

299
00:21:00,069 --> 00:21:01,730
Please don't just say, ah, who cares.

300
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,431
But do something about it.

301
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:04,672
But just keep those records.

302
00:21:06,192 --> 00:21:07,033
Talk to this slide real quick.

303
00:21:07,073 --> 00:21:07,273
So.

304
00:21:07,753 --> 00:21:08,233
Yes.

305
00:21:08,674 --> 00:21:13,016
So again, what we're saying here, put a process in place, engage people with disabilities.

306
00:21:13,476 --> 00:21:14,757
Those go hand in hand.

307
00:21:15,677 --> 00:21:21,100
I work with a large publisher of games and we put in place the.

308
00:21:22,308 --> 00:21:29,352
The process of roles and responsibilities, some training, the checklists, these piece

309
00:21:29,432 --> 00:21:32,614
parts of a program so everybody can share those resources.

310
00:21:33,115 --> 00:21:38,458
And then when it comes to persons with disabilities, happens to be level access, our company is

311
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:43,001
about 200 or so people, so we're fairly small but growing.

312
00:21:43,021 --> 00:21:45,042
It's bigger than mine.

313
00:21:45,062 --> 00:21:48,544
Over 50% of our people are persons with disabilities.

314
00:21:48,604 --> 00:21:49,665
So we have a lot of

315
00:21:50,092 --> 00:21:54,753
people on our staff who perform that role of maybe being engaged with a client.

316
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:57,755
But then there's organizations like AbleGamers.

317
00:21:57,895 --> 00:22:02,196
You know, engaging with people with disabilities can be somewhat intimidating.

318
00:22:02,576 --> 00:22:05,818
So AbleGamers worked to kind of fix that.

319
00:22:06,418 --> 00:22:08,639
And we have something called our player panel.

320
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:15,802
We would like to invite Chris, Dr. Chris Power up here, who is the person spearheading this

321
00:22:15,842 --> 00:22:18,923
project to just say something about it because what we're creating has

322
00:22:19,302 --> 00:22:21,403
kind of already started changing the game industry.

323
00:22:22,183 --> 00:22:23,043
I think that's a live mic.

324
00:22:25,604 --> 00:22:30,625
So what we're doing is we're providing an opportunity for game developers, for designers,

325
00:22:30,705 --> 00:22:34,946
for researchers, those who want to do either user research with players with disabilities

326
00:22:35,347 --> 00:22:36,287
or game testing.

327
00:22:36,927 --> 00:22:41,468
And the process by which it works is that we've collected information with a group of

328
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:42,488
people with disabilities.

329
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:43,969
We currently have about 300 people.

330
00:22:45,579 --> 00:22:52,204
across the disability spectrum in terms of disability use and in terms of assistive technology

331
00:22:52,324 --> 00:22:52,484
use.

332
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:58,249
The process that we've put in place is you as designers come to us, you tell us what

333
00:22:58,289 --> 00:23:04,514
your need is and what you're going to remunerate our players with and we will advertise that

334
00:23:04,574 --> 00:23:11,040
to the panel and ask people who meet the criteria for your study whether they would like to

335
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:11,640
participate.

336
00:23:12,842 --> 00:23:18,065
When we get those responses back, we then pass off the contact information to you, and

337
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:21,126
you can engage with the players in the type of work that you want to do.

338
00:23:21,206 --> 00:23:22,547
We take no money for this.

339
00:23:23,087 --> 00:23:26,869
All we are doing is providing a matchmaking service so that people with disabilities can

340
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:28,289
be involved in the process more.

341
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:34,612
Yeah, and this is, I will tell you something that's, as an advocate here, when we put out

342
00:23:34,632 --> 00:23:38,454
the original tweet, Chris and I had a bet that we would get about 25 or 35 people.

343
00:23:41,258 --> 00:23:50,301
We had 142 of them in two days, and we have 300 vetted, but I know there's still now like

344
00:23:51,562 --> 00:23:54,223
54, last count, that we haven't even sent the initial survey out.

345
00:23:54,263 --> 00:23:56,664
We got three people yesterday, one person this morning.

346
00:23:56,724 --> 00:24:01,525
So people with disabilities are eager, eager to jump in here.

347
00:24:01,685 --> 00:24:06,527
And we've been really lucky because we've had Greg Haynes, part of our group, working

348
00:24:06,927 --> 00:24:08,388
to collect that information.

349
00:24:08,838 --> 00:24:12,279
We've had Jen Beeston, who's one of our PhD students at the University of York,

350
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:15,560
who's been working on the demographics to understand who we have available.

351
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,501
And we also have a great picture now of who people with disabilities are in gaming.

352
00:24:20,921 --> 00:24:23,962
And we're expanding this program so that we can give them a voice.

353
00:24:24,102 --> 00:24:28,063
And AbleGamers will be working with those players to understand what are the current

354
00:24:28,744 --> 00:24:31,945
experiences that they're having in games, so that we can start talking about those

355
00:24:32,005 --> 00:24:36,586
accessible player experiences with game developers.

356
00:24:37,022 --> 00:24:41,025
And I'm really grateful that Jen and her co-supervisor Paul Cairns have been working very closely

357
00:24:41,285 --> 00:24:42,325
with AbleGamers on this.

358
00:24:42,646 --> 00:24:43,326
This is pretty cool.

359
00:24:43,366 --> 00:24:48,369
It's the first time gamers with disabilities are really being included from a knowledge

360
00:24:48,409 --> 00:24:48,889
perspective.

361
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,350
So we're almost out of time.

362
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,831
I want to give a couple of questions.

363
00:24:53,732 --> 00:24:55,673
I do want to say that there's a great policy paper.

364
00:24:55,713 --> 00:24:59,576
We are not lawyers, but I watch a lot of Judge Judy.

365
00:25:00,937 --> 00:25:03,518
But we did consult with lawyers before we came here.

366
00:25:04,199 --> 00:25:04,939
Kelly Dreyer.

367
00:25:05,389 --> 00:25:09,132
helped us with this presentation to give us all of the proper information.

368
00:25:09,152 --> 00:25:11,794
They have a policy PDF if you go to that URL or if you have a QR reader that's a four-pager

369
00:25:11,814 --> 00:25:13,495
that kind of gives you a breakdown of this entire presentation.

370
00:25:13,515 --> 00:25:15,777
You can reach out to AbleGamers if you're small and you don't have any money and you

371
00:25:15,797 --> 00:25:15,997
need help.

372
00:25:16,017 --> 00:25:17,978
If you have money, reach out to Level Access because, or if you do have money and you want

373
00:25:17,998 --> 00:25:21,381
to help for us and just give us money, we're a charity, we'll take it.

374
00:25:21,401 --> 00:25:22,081
I look forward to seeing you.

375
00:25:22,101 --> 00:25:22,161
Bye.

376
00:25:22,181 --> 00:25:22,241
Bye.

377
00:25:22,281 --> 00:25:22,341
Bye.

378
00:25:22,361 --> 00:25:22,421
Bye.

379
00:25:22,481 --> 00:25:22,541
Bye.

380
00:25:22,561 --> 00:25:22,641
Bye.

381
00:25:22,661 --> 00:25:22,721
Bye.

382
00:25:22,741 --> 00:25:22,802
Bye.

383
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:22,882
Bye.

384
00:25:22,902 --> 00:25:23,002
Bye.

385
00:25:23,082 --> 00:25:25,964
Thanks for the opportunity to present our presentation today to the level access community.

386
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:28,105
Thanks to our audience, we are grateful for your support.

387
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:30,727
We will now take a short break and come back for the Q&A from our panel.

388
00:25:30,747 --> 00:25:32,749
If you want to check our other presentations, click on the link and participate in the

389
00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:33,529
Q&A and we will be back here shortly.

390
00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:33,729
Thank you.

391
00:25:33,749 --> 00:25:33,929
Thank you.

392
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:34,010
Bye.

393
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:34,090
Bye.

394
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:34,370
Bye.

395
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:34,510
Bye.

396
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:34,590
Bye.

397
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:34,690
Bye.

398
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:34,770
Bye.

399
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:34,870
Bye.

400
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:34,950
Bye.

401
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:35,030
Bye.

402
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:35,110
Bye.

403
00:25:35,477 --> 00:25:38,479
I'm really excited that we were able to have this talk.

404
00:25:38,819 --> 00:25:41,922
And I think we have just about five minutes if anyone has any questions.

405
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:43,963
Come on, someone had a question.

406
00:25:47,265 --> 00:25:47,846
So I have a question.

407
00:25:48,086 --> 00:25:51,808
Who here thinks that the content they're working on is going to be covered under CVAA now that

408
00:25:51,848 --> 00:25:52,569
you've heard about it?

409
00:25:55,491 --> 00:25:57,692
With the lights in my eyes, I think I see three hands.

410
00:25:59,754 --> 00:26:03,956
Who is rethinking some of the things they're putting in their games now that they know

411
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:05,017
the CVAA is there?

412
00:26:06,927 --> 00:26:09,429
Guys, I'll tell you, it's not that hard to do this.

413
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:13,752
So do it, because games need to be accessible.

414
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:17,574
You want as many people playing your game as possible, and accessibility features.

415
00:26:17,834 --> 00:26:18,515
Interesting number.

416
00:26:18,555 --> 00:26:22,057
Did you know that 80% of people use a feature that's an accessibility feature?

417
00:26:23,538 --> 00:26:29,281
The biggest one being making the little slider at the bottom of Windows where you make PowerPoints

418
00:26:29,361 --> 00:26:31,803
and things bigger so that you can move stuff around.

419
00:26:31,963 --> 00:26:33,844
That was actually built as an accessibility feature.

420
00:26:34,044 --> 00:26:34,805
And you all use it.

421
00:26:35,534 --> 00:26:38,175
And we're seeing lots of things that are being used across.

422
00:26:38,195 --> 00:26:40,396
So subtitling is one of the ones that's a great example.

423
00:26:40,436 --> 00:26:43,938
We're lots and lots of players who aren't hard of hearing.

424
00:26:44,118 --> 00:26:44,838
We had a research.

425
00:26:44,858 --> 00:26:46,839
The research said we had 17 people

426
00:26:46,879 --> 00:26:49,600
that we surveyed that were deaf or hard of hearing,

427
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,681
but 98 people said that they use subtitles.

428
00:26:53,601 --> 00:26:56,382
So there's lots of situations in which people can't use sound,

429
00:26:56,503 --> 00:26:58,343
be it when they're traveling on a plane

430
00:26:58,423 --> 00:26:59,864
or when they're sitting in a room like this,

431
00:26:59,924 --> 00:27:01,805
for all those who are currently playing Two Dots.

432
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:04,768
where you need to have different indications of sound.

433
00:27:04,888 --> 00:27:07,610
So we're seeing things like that that help design across

434
00:27:08,771 --> 00:27:10,812
the different types of games that are out there.

435
00:27:12,153 --> 00:27:13,094
I think someone's at the mic.

436
00:27:13,134 --> 00:27:14,495
I'm not sure there's a shadow...

437
00:27:14,935 --> 00:27:15,896
Go ahead.

438
00:27:15,956 --> 00:27:16,236
Hi.

439
00:27:17,056 --> 00:27:19,518
I have a question about to what extent,

440
00:27:19,678 --> 00:27:22,260
if you were a small team or a solo game dev,

441
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,643
do game making tools like Unity or Unreal

442
00:27:26,703 --> 00:27:29,645
have a responsibility to provide an accessibility API

443
00:27:29,665 --> 00:27:30,725
to make it easier to make?

444
00:27:31,643 --> 00:27:33,724
Well, that's been a conversation all week.

445
00:27:34,024 --> 00:27:35,964
Why doesn't Unity do some accessibility?

446
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:38,205
I think there is some moves afoot.

447
00:27:38,385 --> 00:27:39,545
There's a plugin.

448
00:27:39,765 --> 00:27:41,966
There is an accessibility plugin in Unity, we know.

449
00:27:42,146 --> 00:27:44,787
It's not great, but it is good.

450
00:27:44,807 --> 00:27:45,647
It's a good start.

451
00:27:47,068 --> 00:27:47,888
But there is a move.

452
00:27:47,908 --> 00:27:51,129
I would really like to see people way smarter than me kind of do a working group

453
00:27:51,489 --> 00:27:56,050
to go ahead and build some accessibility plugins in Unity and just give them out.

454
00:27:57,111 --> 00:27:59,832
A friend of mine, Victoria, she was trying it, but...

455
00:28:00,251 --> 00:28:03,214
She wasn't getting any traction, so she kind of had to go make money and work.

456
00:28:03,814 --> 00:28:08,978
But I really would like to see developers step up and kind of create an open source

457
00:28:09,099 --> 00:28:13,602
Unity plug-in, get it on GitHub, let people start contributing to it.

458
00:28:13,702 --> 00:28:17,506
And that way it's not, you don't have to lovingly handcraft accessibility.

459
00:28:17,966 --> 00:28:20,728
You can just plug it in and go.

460
00:28:21,709 --> 00:28:26,854
I also think it's an important point to make that achievability is an important aspect

461
00:28:26,894 --> 00:28:27,694
of CVAA.

462
00:28:27,754 --> 00:28:28,795
It's actually spelled out.

463
00:28:29,377 --> 00:28:33,861
So if somehow what you're doing, you're trying and you're keeping those records,

464
00:28:33,901 --> 00:28:38,244
but somehow it's not all worked out yet, that's a journey you're on, right?

465
00:28:38,845 --> 00:28:42,888
What would not be a good idea is to not certify and you're covered

466
00:28:43,228 --> 00:28:45,210
and not keep any records at all.

467
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:48,913
But if you're keeping those records and you're still not successful,

468
00:28:49,013 --> 00:28:51,815
but it's not quite done, that's a journey you're on.

469
00:28:51,895 --> 00:28:53,197
And it's okay to be there.

470
00:28:53,277 --> 00:28:56,439
I always tell our clients, you're never going to be 100%

471
00:28:58,375 --> 00:29:00,276
accessible conforming all the time.

472
00:29:00,976 --> 00:29:04,558
It's, and even in other platforms, it's very difficult to do that at 100%.

473
00:29:04,598 --> 00:29:09,900
But the FCC is wanting to see that you're making efforts towards that.

474
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:10,620
And that's why I'm here.

475
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:10,841
All right.

476
00:29:11,481 --> 00:29:15,283
I got the giant X in the back, which means we are out of time.

477
00:29:15,363 --> 00:29:17,724
Thank you guys for coming to our thing.

478
00:29:17,744 --> 00:29:20,125
Glad to speak with any of you if you want.

479
00:29:20,165 --> 00:29:25,207
Yeah, we're going to pack our stuff up and head out there if we want to just buy us lunch

480
00:29:25,227 --> 00:29:26,468
because this was a great presentation.

481
00:29:27,043 --> 00:29:27,745
And thank you guys.

482
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:28,567
Thank you for coming.

483
00:29:28,608 --> 00:29:29,390
Thank you for coming.
