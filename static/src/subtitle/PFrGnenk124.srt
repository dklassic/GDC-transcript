1
00:00:06,008 --> 00:00:08,310
Okay, here we go.

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,131
My name is Asher Vollmer.

3
00:00:10,131 --> 00:00:12,031
I made this game called Threes, it's up there.

4
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:14,573
You might have heard of it.

5
00:00:14,573 --> 00:00:17,594
And most importantly for this talk, I went to USC,

6
00:00:17,594 --> 00:00:21,376
one of my favorite universities.

7
00:00:21,376 --> 00:00:22,557
Yeah, good.

8
00:00:22,557 --> 00:00:24,898
I loved it, I learned a lot for context.

9
00:00:24,898 --> 00:00:27,219
I started in 2008 and I graduated in 2012.

10
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:30,000
And I've been coming to GDC all those years,

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,142
which means that this is my 10th GDC.

12
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:36,982
And that makes me your resident dinosaur.

13
00:00:36,982 --> 00:00:38,382
Thanks.

14
00:00:38,382 --> 00:00:41,163
And I'm full of wisdom.

15
00:00:41,163 --> 00:00:42,804
OK, so I've got a lot to say.

16
00:00:42,804 --> 00:00:44,044
I'm going to stop talking slowly.

17
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,364
I've got a lot to say.

18
00:00:45,364 --> 00:00:46,885
I'm just going to jump straight to the point.

19
00:00:46,885 --> 00:00:50,266
Here's my number one tip for going indie after college.

20
00:00:50,266 --> 00:00:50,726
Don't do it.

21
00:00:50,726 --> 00:00:54,367
What are you doing?

22
00:00:54,367 --> 00:00:57,188
This is a crazy idea.

23
00:00:57,188 --> 00:00:59,529
Later up, Jenny and Ted are going to talk as well.

24
00:00:59,529 --> 00:01:01,109
And they're lovely people.

25
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:02,170
And they're going to pump you up.

26
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:06,792
But I'm on stage right now, and I'm going to be a big old bummer

27
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:12,935
about the kind of realities of being an indie game developer.

28
00:01:12,935 --> 00:01:16,476
First off, first lesson I wish anyone told me when I was in school

29
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:18,977
is that game development is super slow.

30
00:01:18,977 --> 00:01:21,198
It's a very, very slow process.

31
00:01:21,198 --> 00:01:24,359
And this was a revelation to me because I had done a million game jams,

32
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:25,800
and I loved game jams, and I was like,

33
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,801
oh, I can make games at like a million miles per minute.

34
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:30,141
But that's not really...

35
00:01:30,856 --> 00:01:31,556
what was happening.

36
00:01:31,556 --> 00:01:37,238
A game jam game is usually about like 10 minutes of gameplay, generously, a pretty title screen,

37
00:01:37,238 --> 00:01:40,980
and some music and sound effects, and that's like, oh my god, I made a cool game.

38
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,321
But that is not releasing a video game.

39
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:44,661
That is making a game jam game.

40
00:01:44,661 --> 00:01:47,342
Releasing a video game looks more like this.

41
00:01:47,342 --> 00:01:52,044
There's playtesting, QA, art, platform integration, reaching out to press and platforms, deciding

42
00:01:52,044 --> 00:01:57,426
when the right time to release, deciding who to give free keys to, getting a lawyer, making

43
00:01:57,426 --> 00:01:58,847
sure all the contracts are signed.

44
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:01,535
all the stuff and making time to make marketing materials.

45
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:04,636
Marketing materials take forever, don't forget.

46
00:02:04,636 --> 00:02:06,617
And so that takes forever to do.

47
00:02:06,617 --> 00:02:09,678
And then you'll look back, and you're like, wait a minute.

48
00:02:09,678 --> 00:02:10,839
I only have 10 minutes of gameplay.

49
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,040
Maybe I should think this through before I start

50
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,381
committing to all of this.

51
00:02:14,381 --> 00:02:16,942
Maybe I should spend more time making the game better,

52
00:02:16,942 --> 00:02:18,423
which makes the game development take longer,

53
00:02:18,423 --> 00:02:21,104
because the real main marketing material you need

54
00:02:21,104 --> 00:02:23,105
is a reason that anyone should care about your game at all.

55
00:02:23,105 --> 00:02:26,146
And it's really hard to do that when your game is tiny.

56
00:02:27,596 --> 00:02:31,377
Tom Francis earlier this week, a very smart guy, made Heat Signature and Gunpoint,

57
00:02:31,377 --> 00:02:35,738
proposed this timeline to me earlier this week, and I really like it.

58
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:39,219
The first step to making a video game is to fully understand your game.

59
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:44,740
And this will take roughly five minutes to infinity years. Somewhere in there.

60
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,481
And then, step two is to release your game, which will take about a year after that.

61
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:52,982
So your game will take anywhere from a year to infinity plus one years.

62
00:02:52,982 --> 00:02:56,343
So good luck with that. Also, it's game development.

63
00:02:56,963 --> 00:03:00,186
is incredibly expensive.

64
00:03:00,186 --> 00:03:02,448
Cool thing about college is that it's free,

65
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:06,192
totally free, no strings attached.

66
00:03:06,192 --> 00:03:10,035
Yeah, not true, but when you're in college,

67
00:03:10,035 --> 00:03:12,618
you have a lot of permission to be in college

68
00:03:12,618 --> 00:03:14,740
and to learn things and to experiment.

69
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,163
And you have this blanket understanding

70
00:03:18,163 --> 00:03:19,905
that you should be enjoying your life

71
00:03:19,905 --> 00:03:22,047
and trying new things and learning and growing.

72
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:26,252
And as soon as you get out into the real world, all that turns into guilt.

73
00:03:26,252 --> 00:03:29,874
And all that time turns into, like, oh god, money.

74
00:03:29,874 --> 00:03:31,275
Rent is obvious.

75
00:03:31,275 --> 00:03:32,576
Food is obvious.

76
00:03:32,576 --> 00:03:34,697
A lot of you might be thinking, I don't need health insurance.

77
00:03:34,697 --> 00:03:37,539
And that is the worst thing you could possibly think.

78
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:38,460
Get health insurance.

79
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,000
Oh my god.

80
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,760
And it costs money.

81
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,502
I'm sorry.

82
00:03:41,502 --> 00:03:42,042
But you're young.

83
00:03:42,042 --> 00:03:44,223
It's cheaper than me.

84
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:47,285
And also, random, annoying junk also costs money.

85
00:03:48,351 --> 00:03:51,914
So life costs money, but also the game itself costs money.

86
00:03:51,914 --> 00:03:54,955
If you're lacking at some talents,

87
00:03:54,955 --> 00:03:56,116
maybe you're not so good at art,

88
00:03:56,116 --> 00:03:57,917
maybe you're not so good at music, whatever,

89
00:03:57,917 --> 00:03:59,738
you wanna make sure that you're collaborating

90
00:03:59,738 --> 00:04:00,919
with people who can do that,

91
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:03,440
and they're gonna need to get paid somehow.

92
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,022
So that costs money, and also we live in a cool era

93
00:04:06,022 --> 00:04:09,824
where software is subscription now a lot,

94
00:04:09,824 --> 00:04:12,486
and if your game is taking infinity years to make,

95
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:15,367
that's infinity dollars to have any software.

96
00:04:16,811 --> 00:04:19,372
So games are super expensive.

97
00:04:19,372 --> 00:04:21,973
And also, my next slide is very scary.

98
00:04:21,973 --> 00:04:23,594
And I'm sorry about it in advance.

99
00:04:23,594 --> 00:04:25,195
Here it comes.

100
00:04:25,195 --> 00:04:26,755
You're not going to make your money back

101
00:04:26,755 --> 00:04:27,756
after you release your game.

102
00:04:27,756 --> 00:04:28,216
Sorry.

103
00:04:28,216 --> 00:04:30,637
This is a really sad, scary slide.

104
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,418
But it's just sort of something you

105
00:04:32,418 --> 00:04:35,900
have to accept when you're going into this.

106
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,860
Businesses move in cycles.

107
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,081
Earlier this week, Jeff Vogel of SpiderWeb Software,

108
00:04:40,081 --> 00:04:43,543
who has been an indie game developer for 24 years,

109
00:04:43,543 --> 00:04:45,244
longer than probably a lot of you have been alive,

110
00:04:46,698 --> 00:04:50,140
has actually seen this happen to the game industry.

111
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,862
There was a huge peak very recently with Steam,

112
00:04:53,862 --> 00:04:57,084
making games make tons and tons and tons of money.

113
00:04:57,084 --> 00:04:59,626
But now we've experienced the glut of indie games,

114
00:04:59,626 --> 00:05:01,607
and now we are in the contraction.

115
00:05:01,607 --> 00:05:04,329
So games are making less money than recently.

116
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:07,871
So just be aware that games are expensive,

117
00:05:07,871 --> 00:05:09,832
and you're not gonna make your money back.

118
00:05:09,832 --> 00:05:12,894
Also, game development is emotionally draining.

119
00:05:12,894 --> 00:05:14,375
I'm sorry, there's so many of these.

120
00:05:17,187 --> 00:05:19,128
I'm emotionally drained giving this talk.

121
00:05:19,128 --> 00:05:23,050
So in college, you have all these amazing support

122
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:23,330
structures.

123
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,591
Teachers are your mentors.

124
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:25,932
Classes give you deadlines.

125
00:05:25,932 --> 00:05:28,733
Extracurricular classes give you tons of inspiration.

126
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:31,215
And then your friends are within a mile radius

127
00:05:31,215 --> 00:05:33,516
to give you critique.

128
00:05:33,516 --> 00:05:35,477
And cool thing is that when college is over,

129
00:05:35,477 --> 00:05:37,259
all those things go away.

130
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:38,659
Sorry.

131
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:41,461
And those things are important when you're in college,

132
00:05:41,461 --> 00:05:43,302
because they help you grow as a person.

133
00:05:44,102 --> 00:05:49,105
But surprise, here's a cool fact, is that you're never actually done growing as a person.

134
00:05:49,105 --> 00:05:52,247
So what your job is going to have to be, in addition to making a game,

135
00:05:52,247 --> 00:05:55,709
is also getting all those support structures back into your life somehow.

136
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:58,671
Which is hard, but possible, but hard.

137
00:05:58,671 --> 00:06:05,015
A quick example is, in the four years since threes,

138
00:06:05,015 --> 00:06:09,118
I've made probably 30 different prototypes, some of which are up here,

139
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,399
trying to figure out who I am and what kind of games I want to make.

140
00:06:12,314 --> 00:06:14,575
And most of these are in some form of abandoned

141
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:17,457
because I decided that they were not worth my time, which

142
00:06:17,457 --> 00:06:21,179
was a decision that was made.

143
00:06:21,179 --> 00:06:24,101
Anyway, so to recap, game development

144
00:06:24,101 --> 00:06:27,763
is incredibly slow, incredibly expensive,

145
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,064
and emotionally draining.

146
00:06:29,064 --> 00:06:29,664
Are you scared yet?

147
00:06:29,664 --> 00:06:33,126
Because you should be.

148
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:36,128
Anyway, this is me being a jerk.

149
00:06:36,128 --> 00:06:37,209
Sorry about that.

150
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:38,089
But I'm here to be real.

151
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:43,117
And I kind of wish more people would have been real when I was in college

152
00:06:43,117 --> 00:06:46,579
and been up front with this stuff about me.

153
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:51,061
So if you're looking at these and you're still thinking to yourself,

154
00:06:51,061 --> 00:06:57,244
well, I can't really imagine anything else I'd rather be doing with my life.

155
00:06:57,244 --> 00:06:58,204
Well, good. OK. Cool.

156
00:06:58,204 --> 00:07:01,506
Then you might have a chance.

157
00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:03,567
You might even be up for this crazy challenge.

158
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:07,449
And here are some coping mechanisms for dealing with all these things.

159
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:11,452
Because life is one big coping mechanism.

160
00:07:11,452 --> 00:07:14,514
Here's some quick tips, quick life hacks.

161
00:07:14,514 --> 00:07:15,275
How to cope financially.

162
00:07:15,275 --> 00:07:16,436
Eat out less.

163
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,038
You're all students, we all eat out at the time.

164
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:19,899
Stop it.

165
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:20,819
Stop what you're doing.

166
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:25,583
Learn what food you love to eat out the most and learn how to make it.

167
00:07:26,044 --> 00:07:28,065
And then you can buy all the products in bulk,

168
00:07:28,065 --> 00:07:30,806
and you'll save a ton of money, and you can be indie for longer.

169
00:07:30,806 --> 00:07:32,586
Also, use your freezer.

170
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:34,907
This is a huge look up Google how to use your freezer

171
00:07:34,907 --> 00:07:35,307
effectively.

172
00:07:35,307 --> 00:07:36,348
This is a huge thing.

173
00:07:36,348 --> 00:07:38,669
It's going to save you a million dollars.

174
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:42,010
And bike instead of using a car.

175
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:45,911
Oh, and also, rev share if you can't pay people up front.

176
00:07:45,911 --> 00:07:48,132
But make sure that you're doing it ethically.

177
00:07:48,132 --> 00:07:49,452
Always pay people for their work.

178
00:07:49,452 --> 00:07:51,013
Make sure that they can support that.

179
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:53,514
That's coping financially.

180
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,674
Here's how to cope emotionally.

181
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:55,355
I'm running out of time.

182
00:07:55,355 --> 00:07:55,635
I'm sorry.

183
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,363
Make time for people. Like, cool, you're making a game, it's your whole lifeblood.

184
00:08:01,363 --> 00:08:05,827
If it fails, you fail. I'm sorry. But make sure you have time for the people in your life,

185
00:08:05,827 --> 00:08:11,912
because you will feel so isolated otherwise. Make time for exercise. Another cool life hack.

186
00:08:11,912 --> 00:08:17,356
Instant, like, you feel better when you exercise. Who knew? Take classes. Like I said,

187
00:08:17,356 --> 00:08:22,780
you're never done growing. Improv, pottery, doesn't matter. And finally, reevaluate regularly

188
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,442
how you're doing. How is the process? What's it like?

189
00:08:25,803 --> 00:08:28,005
Has this been good?

190
00:08:28,005 --> 00:08:31,127
Don't reevaluate daily, hourly.

191
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:32,048
That's a mistake.

192
00:08:32,048 --> 00:08:33,429
I've made that mistake.

193
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:37,011
Look back on the week or the month and be like, was this a good plan?

194
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:39,473
And then make a new plan and then stick with it.

195
00:08:39,473 --> 00:08:44,057
And here's how you cope with the passage of time.

196
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:44,657
You don't.

197
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:46,379
Sorry.

198
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:47,239
Be young, I guess.

199
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:48,180
You did it.

200
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:54,305
Anyway, I just want to apologize one last time for this talk.

201
00:08:54,507 --> 00:09:02,870
I've been a terrible person, but my goal is to help you find some way to cope.

202
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:07,272
And look out at the indie life and see that it is a very rough road ahead.

203
00:09:07,272 --> 00:09:13,894
And if you are still somehow convinced that that is the right thing to do, there are ways

204
00:09:13,894 --> 00:09:14,875
to do it.

205
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,475
Anyway, thank you, and good luck.

206
00:09:39,347 --> 00:09:52,380
Can everyone hear me? Yeah? All right. Oh man, I'm so tall. Okay. Hi, everyone. Thank you for coming to my talk about going indie after college.

207
00:09:52,380 --> 00:10:02,771
My name is Jenny, and I go by Qdork on Twitter and Instagram, and I graduated from the NYU Game Center's BFA program for game design last year.

208
00:10:04,022 --> 00:10:07,504
During my time as an undergrad, I collaborated with AP Thompson,

209
00:10:07,504 --> 00:10:09,726
another graduate from the MFA program,

210
00:10:09,726 --> 00:10:12,288
and we worked together on a couple of games together.

211
00:10:12,288 --> 00:10:14,730
We submitted our games to festivals like the IGF,

212
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:18,873
Fantastic Arcade, and Indiecade, and MPD Design and Programming,

213
00:10:18,873 --> 00:10:21,615
while I mostly contributed art to these projects.

214
00:10:21,615 --> 00:10:24,737
Together, we made this game called Stellar Smooch.

215
00:10:24,737 --> 00:10:27,580
It's about kissing and loneliness in space.

216
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,022
Stellar Smooch got an IGF nomination for Best Student

217
00:10:31,022 --> 00:10:31,823
Game in 2015.

218
00:10:34,137 --> 00:10:37,119
The following year, we teamed up again to make BeGlitched,

219
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:39,961
a pastel match-three roguelike about insecurity

220
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:42,323
in computers and ourselves.

221
00:10:42,323 --> 00:10:44,684
BeGlitched won best student game at the IGF in 2016.

222
00:10:44,684 --> 00:10:48,607
So those are a couple of games AP and I worked on together.

223
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:51,469
I also like to code and design games on my own,

224
00:10:51,469 --> 00:10:53,950
so here are some projects I made solo.

225
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,412
This is a game I made for a class

226
00:10:56,412 --> 00:10:58,533
where you have to put on your makeup in 10 seconds or less.

227
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,335
It's called Morning Makeup Madness.

228
00:11:01,585 --> 00:11:08,771
And here's another game where you have to put this noodley-limbed avatar through a series of challenging workout poses.

229
00:11:08,771 --> 00:11:12,453
For my capstone project, I started working on a personal game about dieting.

230
00:11:12,453 --> 00:11:19,979
It's called Consume Me, and it's still a work in progress.

231
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:26,203
While I was in school, I posted my work in progress and game development to social media, and that helped me get my name out there.

232
00:11:26,203 --> 00:11:29,886
It all led to awards and getting opportunities to give talks about my work.

233
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:35,861
By a lot of people's definition of success, they might think I'm successful.

234
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:40,122
But you're also thinking, hey, maybe she just works really hard

235
00:11:40,122 --> 00:11:42,403
and put in a lot of effort to get to where she is.

236
00:11:42,403 --> 00:11:46,704
Well, I think we know that's not the entire story.

237
00:11:46,704 --> 00:11:49,065
Has anyone heard of survivorship bias?

238
00:11:49,065 --> 00:11:51,146
Here's a comic which pretty much sums it up.

239
00:11:51,146 --> 00:11:54,387
So survivorship bias is a cognitive bias that

240
00:11:54,387 --> 00:11:57,968
occurs when someone tries to make a decision based on past successes

241
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:59,569
while ignoring past failures.

242
00:12:00,243 --> 00:12:03,705
Popular media often tells us the story of this determined

243
00:12:03,705 --> 00:12:06,647
individual who pursues their dreams and beats the odds.

244
00:12:06,647 --> 00:12:10,089
There's much less of a focus on the many people that may be

245
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:12,371
similarly skilled and determined but fail to ever

246
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:15,273
find success because of factors beyond their own control

247
00:12:15,273 --> 00:12:17,214
or other seemingly random events.

248
00:12:17,214 --> 00:12:20,857
And this creates a false perception that anyone can

249
00:12:20,857 --> 00:12:24,019
achieve great things if they just have the ability and make

250
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:24,259
the effort.

251
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:27,141
Hard work and effort do matter, but there's more to success

252
00:12:27,141 --> 00:12:28,061
than just that.

253
00:12:29,423 --> 00:12:32,045
A lot of people are going to talk about their success,

254
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:35,808
but not mention the advantages and privileges they have.

255
00:12:35,808 --> 00:12:41,493
So here are some that you may have never realized I even had.

256
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:43,875
First of all, I don't require any food or sleep.

257
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,557
I can pull all-nighters, and I just

258
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:50,020
happen to be born with an unlimited resource of energy,

259
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,302
talent, and creativity.

260
00:12:52,302 --> 00:12:54,343
I have never, ever felt depressed, or sad,

261
00:12:54,343 --> 00:12:57,346
or hopeless in my entire life, not even in a single day.

262
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:01,317
And I'm the life of the party, both online and offline.

263
00:13:01,317 --> 00:13:06,941
I've never felt lonely, and I definitely don't have social anxiety or anything.

264
00:13:06,941 --> 00:13:12,224
Finally, I'm also undying and perfect, the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end.

265
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:16,968
So, if you haven't realized it at this point, basically, success is something you're born with.

266
00:13:16,968 --> 00:13:20,870
And if you weren't born successful, I'm sorry, I can't help you, you better just leave this talk.

267
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:21,771
Okay, that was a joke. I hope you got that it was a joke.

268
00:13:28,195 --> 00:13:30,357
But here are some real disclaimers I'm going to mention.

269
00:13:30,357 --> 00:13:34,642
Yes, I worked really hard and put in a lot of effort to get to where I am, but I would

270
00:13:34,642 --> 00:13:37,866
be nowhere without these privileges and advantages.

271
00:13:37,866 --> 00:13:40,989
I graduated from a great university without student loans.

272
00:13:40,989 --> 00:13:44,833
I didn't have to worry about my living situation after I graduated.

273
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:48,638
My parents lived in the city and I lived with them during part of my time at NYU.

274
00:13:49,691 --> 00:13:52,592
I got to collaborate with some pretty fantastic people.

275
00:13:52,592 --> 00:13:55,073
My school gave me access to a lot of good resources,

276
00:13:55,073 --> 00:13:56,693
like professors and friends, and I

277
00:13:56,693 --> 00:13:59,034
couldn't have made any of these award-winning games

278
00:13:59,034 --> 00:13:59,714
without AP.

279
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,995
BGLICH gave me a safety net.

280
00:14:01,995 --> 00:14:04,316
It made me enough money, which meant I had some time

281
00:14:04,316 --> 00:14:06,876
to experiment and continue making my own stuff.

282
00:14:06,876 --> 00:14:09,957
And to reiterate and put everything into context,

283
00:14:09,957 --> 00:14:12,638
I got to do what I do because I graduated school

284
00:14:12,638 --> 00:14:14,839
without this pressure of finding a job

285
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,240
and supporting myself financially immediately.

286
00:14:18,273 --> 00:14:22,635
So just remember to put success into context when you hear other people talk about their

287
00:14:22,635 --> 00:14:23,656
success stories.

288
00:14:23,656 --> 00:14:29,699
Stuff that worked for me might not work for you, and your path to success might not look

289
00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:30,199
like mine.

290
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:32,380
However, it doesn't mean that you can't succeed.

291
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:38,083
This advice is probably going to be more useful if you have certain similar circumstances

292
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:38,764
to mine.

293
00:14:38,764 --> 00:14:42,486
However, you still might be able to take away some of these points, even if we don't have

294
00:14:42,486 --> 00:14:43,186
a lot in common.

295
00:14:44,113 --> 00:14:46,693
Because at the end of the day, success still ultimately

296
00:14:46,693 --> 00:14:48,994
boils down to luck, like winning the lottery.

297
00:14:48,994 --> 00:14:51,434
And though I can't tell you how to win the lottery,

298
00:14:51,434 --> 00:14:55,155
I can give you advice on how to buy some more lottery tickets.

299
00:14:55,155 --> 00:14:58,015
So a lot of you who want to go indie might have this mindset.

300
00:14:58,015 --> 00:15:01,016
I want to pour in the next five years of my life

301
00:15:01,016 --> 00:15:03,156
and all of my savings into making this one game.

302
00:15:03,156 --> 00:15:04,997
And you better believe it's going

303
00:15:04,997 --> 00:15:07,157
to be all worth it in the end.

304
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:09,098
My first piece of advice is don't

305
00:15:09,098 --> 00:15:10,698
try to make that ultimate game.

306
00:15:10,698 --> 00:15:13,118
Your thesis project won't be the end-all, be-all.

307
00:15:14,735 --> 00:15:15,936
It's a common mistake.

308
00:15:15,936 --> 00:15:19,339
Making The Ultimate Game was the reason why I wanted to go indie.

309
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:22,602
Konsumi was my capstone project, and I was doing everything on my own.

310
00:15:22,602 --> 00:15:24,624
I was coding, designing, and doing art.

311
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:28,127
I wanted to take Konsumi and finish it by myself.

312
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,629
But I had a lot of trouble being my own boss.

313
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,951
I didn't know how to work on a big project by myself.

314
00:15:32,951 --> 00:15:35,213
I struggled with planning out a large, ambitious game,

315
00:15:35,213 --> 00:15:37,115
with time management, with setting deadlines

316
00:15:37,115 --> 00:15:38,156
I could follow through on.

317
00:15:38,156 --> 00:15:40,918
I constantly felt like a huge disappointment to myself.

318
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,418
At the same time, I also had to deal with burning out.

319
00:15:44,418 --> 00:15:47,320
The transition to life after graduation was hard for me

320
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,902
because I felt alone and hopeless a lot of the time,

321
00:15:49,902 --> 00:15:53,005
which made it extremely difficult to solve big design

322
00:15:53,005 --> 00:15:56,467
problems and to really make any progress at all on my game.

323
00:15:56,467 --> 00:15:59,370
So this is how I felt a few months

324
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,191
after going indie after college.

325
00:16:01,191 --> 00:16:05,915
So to reiterate, don't try to make that ultimate game,

326
00:16:05,915 --> 00:16:08,777
especially if you plan to work on it by yourself

327
00:16:08,777 --> 00:16:10,618
and don't have a lot of experience doing it.

328
00:16:11,872 --> 00:16:17,656
Instead, assume that you're probably going to continue making games after you release the current one you're working on.

329
00:16:17,656 --> 00:16:21,518
So it's time to scope down.

330
00:16:21,518 --> 00:16:24,860
Smaller projects let you explore your ideas in a less risky way.

331
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:31,143
Think about spending one month on exploring one design idea versus five years. One month is way less risky, duh.

332
00:16:31,143 --> 00:16:34,645
And each project you work on and release is like buying another lottery ticket.

333
00:16:35,508 --> 00:16:38,069
However, the more tickets you buy, the better of a chance

334
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:40,811
you have to end up successful, because unlike gambling

335
00:16:40,811 --> 00:16:44,513
or winning the lottery, you aren't starting back from zero.

336
00:16:44,513 --> 00:16:46,394
You're gaining skills and learning from mistakes

337
00:16:46,394 --> 00:16:47,455
with each game you ship.

338
00:16:47,455 --> 00:16:50,117
All of this will make you a better developer,

339
00:16:50,117 --> 00:16:51,617
and you can apply every single one

340
00:16:51,617 --> 00:16:53,919
of these valuable lessons you've learned to the next project

341
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:54,819
you choose to work on.

342
00:16:54,819 --> 00:16:57,541
So here are some examples of small projects

343
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,142
that let me experiment with different stuff.

344
00:16:59,142 --> 00:17:01,243
I got commissioned to make each of these games

345
00:17:01,243 --> 00:17:03,144
after I was finished with school.

346
00:17:03,144 --> 00:17:04,905
Here's Bredna, help Bredna clean her room.

347
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:09,396
It took around one month to make it, and I collaborated with AP again, and he programmed it.

348
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:12,218
It was for PlayNYC, and I even made a plush controller for it.

349
00:17:12,218 --> 00:17:17,102
Hungry Buddies, a game where you have to feed your friend the food they're hungry for.

350
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:21,065
I'm in this game for the Luge Vipo arcade in France.

351
00:17:21,065 --> 00:17:23,467
And finally, here's Pip Squeak.

352
00:17:23,467 --> 00:17:26,629
Pip Squeak's a goofy dog who likes walking around and eating eggs.

353
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:27,450
There are 20 levels.

354
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,672
It's the biggest project I made mostly by myself.

355
00:17:29,672 --> 00:17:31,714
It was part of Fantastic Arcade's bundle last year.

356
00:17:31,714 --> 00:17:31,934
Anyway.

357
00:17:34,112 --> 00:17:37,053
These smaller projects not only let me explore new ideas,

358
00:17:37,053 --> 00:17:38,654
they also taught me how to scope better

359
00:17:38,654 --> 00:17:41,496
because I am definitely a person who needs external deadlines

360
00:17:41,496 --> 00:17:42,336
to get things done.

361
00:17:42,336 --> 00:17:44,378
They also gave me space from consume me,

362
00:17:44,378 --> 00:17:46,799
which I needed so I could approach my design problems

363
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,260
with a fresh and new perspective.

364
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,362
Just remember, making smaller projects

365
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,583
doesn't mean you can't make a big one someday.

366
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:56,805
Smaller projects can let you test out a design or concept

367
00:17:56,805 --> 00:18:00,607
without investing too much time and resources

368
00:18:00,607 --> 00:18:03,228
if it turns out to be a crummy idea in the end.

369
00:18:04,247 --> 00:18:08,889
Maybe someday you can turn that idea into your big ultimate dream game.

370
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:14,672
Also, you can't, remember, you can't continue buying lottery tickets if you're burned out or dead.

371
00:18:14,672 --> 00:18:19,554
So I've definitely been close to that there, and it was really not a good place to be in.

372
00:18:19,554 --> 00:18:23,856
Dealing with burning out in isolation were really hard challenges for me,

373
00:18:23,856 --> 00:18:26,037
and I honestly still struggle with that stuff today,

374
00:18:26,037 --> 00:18:29,619
but I do think I've come a long way from where I used to be.

375
00:18:29,619 --> 00:18:31,980
So please be sure to take care of yourself.

376
00:18:34,622 --> 00:18:36,985
Those are some of my tips for buying more lottery tickets.

377
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:40,168
Remember to look at others' successes in context.

378
00:18:40,168 --> 00:18:42,591
And even though success relies a lot on luck,

379
00:18:42,591 --> 00:18:46,294
you do have the ability to increase the odds.

380
00:18:46,294 --> 00:18:48,737
The most valuable thing about going indie for me

381
00:18:48,737 --> 00:18:51,079
was definitely getting the chance to make my own games

382
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:54,103
and also my own mistakes and learning from them, of course.

383
00:18:54,103 --> 00:18:55,364
Anyway, whatever you decide to do,

384
00:18:55,364 --> 00:18:56,445
I wish you the best of luck.

385
00:18:56,445 --> 00:18:57,867
Thank you for your time.

386
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,882
Okay, we got 10 more minutes, let's try to make this work.

387
00:19:25,882 --> 00:19:27,623
Hi, my name is Ted Dinola.

388
00:19:27,623 --> 00:19:29,545
Here are some of the things I've worked on

389
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:31,266
and some of the places I've worked,

390
00:19:31,266 --> 00:19:32,987
but I'm not really here to talk about that,

391
00:19:32,987 --> 00:19:36,329
I'm here to talk about you guys, so let's get on with it.

392
00:19:36,329 --> 00:19:40,112
Many of you are still in school, that is awesome,

393
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:42,873
because school gives you a lot of unique opportunities.

394
00:19:42,873 --> 00:19:44,354
Asher alluded to some of these earlier,

395
00:19:44,354 --> 00:19:46,576
but there are some things that you can be doing

396
00:19:46,576 --> 00:19:48,237
that'll give you a better chance of success,

397
00:19:48,237 --> 00:19:50,418
both now and going forward in your career.

398
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:56,013
First off, the game industry is an industry.

399
00:19:56,013 --> 00:19:58,334
It comes down to shipping games and making money,

400
00:19:58,334 --> 00:20:01,537
but in college, you have the freedom to not make things

401
00:20:01,537 --> 00:20:03,298
that need to be commercially viable

402
00:20:03,298 --> 00:20:04,459
or widely distributable.

403
00:20:04,459 --> 00:20:06,460
You can make things that can only be played

404
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,342
with one weird controller, like thread setting,

405
00:20:08,342 --> 00:20:10,823
emotionally challenging games that can only be played

406
00:20:10,823 --> 00:20:13,225
with one person or in one place, like Deadbolt,

407
00:20:13,225 --> 00:20:15,927
or reveal bits about your life and are hard to swallow,

408
00:20:15,927 --> 00:20:16,327
like N2.

409
00:20:16,327 --> 00:20:18,769
Something like Bad News, which is that game

410
00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:20,070
in the bottom corner there,

411
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:26,698
Literally it requires someone to be manning it full-time as well as a full-time actor and it's one player at a time

412
00:20:26,698 --> 00:20:32,240
So I've never gotten to play it, but I watched for hours as they coordinated this amazing simulation

413
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,322
Jen Sandercox edible games in the top corner stairs a game you literally eat

414
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:40,064
And then down there in the bottom corners coffee. I'm misunderstanding a live-action play

415
00:20:40,064 --> 00:20:43,965
So these are some really weird stuff and you have the freedom to do it

416
00:20:43,965 --> 00:20:47,707
don't just you know use your projects as a way to like make things that you

417
00:20:48,032 --> 00:20:53,175
think are kind of cool and simulate games you love, make weird stuff as much as possible.

418
00:20:53,175 --> 00:20:55,697
One way you can do that is participating in Game Jams.

419
00:20:55,697 --> 00:21:00,440
There are literally hundreds of these all the time.

420
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,181
They are online, they are local.

421
00:21:02,181 --> 00:21:06,724
I strongly recommend if you have one nearby, go physically and work with people.

422
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:09,485
But definitely participate in any way you can.

423
00:21:09,485 --> 00:21:13,468
It's a great opportunity to experiment, try out different mechanics in a really safe space.

424
00:21:13,468 --> 00:21:16,270
Some of those ideas can turn into bigger things.

425
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,262
All of you here are really ahead of the game,

426
00:21:19,262 --> 00:21:21,344
because you've come out to an event,

427
00:21:21,344 --> 00:21:23,866
and you've been meeting people and talking to folks

428
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:26,448
and building those connections.

429
00:21:26,448 --> 00:21:28,729
But find local game meetups in your areas.

430
00:21:28,729 --> 00:21:30,091
If you don't live near a major city,

431
00:21:30,091 --> 00:21:33,073
there's still independent game development organizations,

432
00:21:33,073 --> 00:21:36,716
a great one, and you can find folks to talk to.

433
00:21:36,716 --> 00:21:40,058
If they don't exist in your area, think about making them.

434
00:21:40,058 --> 00:21:42,360
But definitely meet up with other developers

435
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,622
and talk to them and find out what they're doing.

436
00:21:45,188 --> 00:21:46,890
That kind of brings me to networking.

437
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,352
You know, we've all heard about networking.

438
00:21:49,352 --> 00:21:51,394
Very important to making connections.

439
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:54,717
But this is a really, it's not a bunch of cogs and gears.

440
00:21:54,717 --> 00:21:56,479
It's not a transactional thing.

441
00:21:56,479 --> 00:21:58,781
It is about making friends and appreciating what they do.

442
00:21:58,781 --> 00:22:00,823
This is a title by Porpentine, by the way.

443
00:22:00,823 --> 00:22:03,785
And if you're not familiar with their work, you should.

444
00:22:03,785 --> 00:22:06,288
It's all of our job, though, to connect with each other

445
00:22:06,288 --> 00:22:07,429
and build each other up.

446
00:22:07,429 --> 00:22:09,270
Specifically.

447
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,411
All the people in this room right now,

448
00:22:11,411 --> 00:22:12,832
you're all in similar positions.

449
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,553
Make friends, keep in touch, find out what you're doing

450
00:22:15,553 --> 00:22:17,834
because in five or six or 10 years,

451
00:22:17,834 --> 00:22:19,734
you will be able to help each other,

452
00:22:19,734 --> 00:22:21,335
you'll find needs for folks.

453
00:22:21,335 --> 00:22:25,597
And it's our jobs to boost each other up together.

454
00:22:25,597 --> 00:22:28,038
Similar to that is mentorship.

455
00:22:28,038 --> 00:22:30,379
Mentorship is like networking but cross-generational.

456
00:22:30,379 --> 00:22:32,400
There are several people without whom

457
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,141
I would not have been able to have such a successful career.

458
00:22:36,141 --> 00:22:38,302
It doesn't have to be a formal process,

459
00:22:38,302 --> 00:22:39,523
it's not like Johnny Tremaine.

460
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,620
working at the silversmith.

461
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:44,062
It can be something as simple as just keeping in touch

462
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:45,924
over emails, showing your builds out,

463
00:22:45,924 --> 00:22:48,486
messaging someone at 3 a.m. because you have a job offer

464
00:22:48,486 --> 00:22:50,908
and you're not sure if you're gonna take it.

465
00:22:50,908 --> 00:22:53,169
But it's incredibly valuable.

466
00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:55,951
Feel free to shoot us all emails and Twitters and stuff.

467
00:22:55,951 --> 00:22:59,955
We will try to help you out because it's really scary.

468
00:22:59,955 --> 00:23:03,397
But that said, let's talk about going indie after college.

469
00:23:03,397 --> 00:23:05,319
You may remember Asher's slide.

470
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:07,440
This is no surprise.

471
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,521
Don't do this to yourself.

472
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:09,122
At least not.

473
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:14,064
full-time. I'll get to more of that later, but here are some reasons why you really shouldn't.

474
00:23:14,064 --> 00:23:18,105
Kind of expounding on what these two talked about. You guys don't know how to work. And I don't mean

475
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:23,468
that in like the old man way of like, young kids are shiftless and they can't work and they're

476
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:29,410
lazy. I mean you will work yourselves to death. And that is not something you want to do. This

477
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:34,372
is a slide from an amazing Twine game, and I do not know the maker of it, but it is called Retro

478
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:38,973
by the aptly named Starving Indy. There are a lot of things to consider and you

479
00:23:39,509 --> 00:23:44,814
haven't really had experience with them yet. You have a whole lot to learn and

480
00:23:44,814 --> 00:23:49,217
there are things you can do to enable that. Working by yourself in a vacuum

481
00:23:49,217 --> 00:23:53,221
with singular vision, that can work sometimes and there are several

482
00:23:53,221 --> 00:23:56,764
folks who have had really great success but working with a team allows you to

483
00:23:56,764 --> 00:24:01,027
learn a lot more and much more quickly and most importantly it allows you to

484
00:24:01,027 --> 00:24:01,428
avoid

485
00:24:01,879 --> 00:24:06,141
Really bad habits. Just as one small example here,

486
00:24:06,141 --> 00:24:10,483
this is a material graph from an Unreal game on an amazing tumbler.

487
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:14,685
There are a lot of easier ways to do this, but if that's how you've been doing it for years,

488
00:24:14,685 --> 00:24:18,226
you're, you know, good for you. You're spending a lot of time.

489
00:24:18,226 --> 00:24:22,929
Of course, something that we all know about is this industry is incredibly volatile.

490
00:24:24,134 --> 00:24:26,516
This is a chart I'm sure most of you have seen.

491
00:24:26,516 --> 00:24:27,957
This is Steam games released by year.

492
00:24:27,957 --> 00:24:29,358
Ooh, look at that.

493
00:24:29,358 --> 00:24:31,940
So in 2012, there were 403 games released total on Steam.

494
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,702
There were over 7,500 released last year.

495
00:24:34,702 --> 00:24:39,185
Many of you may not be familiar with this corollary chart.

496
00:24:39,185 --> 00:24:41,587
This is median copies owned per game.

497
00:24:41,587 --> 00:24:43,248
So if you were releasing a game in 2012

498
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:45,350
and had some modicum of success,

499
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,932
you could totally run a business off of that.

500
00:24:47,932 --> 00:24:49,653
230 is not a small number.

501
00:24:49,653 --> 00:24:53,596
But 5,000 last year is not something that's sustainable.

502
00:24:54,072 --> 00:24:59,597
Also note that Steam Spy includes keys handed out, so this number is inflated.

503
00:24:59,597 --> 00:25:04,001
I'm going to talk real fast about two games that I released at different times in my career,

504
00:25:04,001 --> 00:25:07,003
and why they were kind of successes or failures.

505
00:25:07,003 --> 00:25:08,624
This first one was a game with balls.

506
00:25:08,624 --> 00:25:11,427
You probably haven't heard about it, and that's totally fine.

507
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:14,049
It was a kind of a cash grab iOS thing that did okay.

508
00:25:16,118 --> 00:25:17,820
We set this game up for success.

509
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,481
We developed it on a really short cycle,

510
00:25:19,481 --> 00:25:24,144
budget was super low, we made deals with Amazon

511
00:25:24,144 --> 00:25:26,605
to have them featured on the Android store,

512
00:25:26,605 --> 00:25:29,587
but things didn't go so great.

513
00:25:29,587 --> 00:25:31,848
See, 2010, Amazon store was new on Android,

514
00:25:31,848 --> 00:25:34,590
they didn't have filtering, so whole bunch of folks

515
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:37,112
with OG Moto Droids downloaded the game.

516
00:25:37,112 --> 00:25:39,553
I don't know if you've tried to run a Unity game

517
00:25:39,553 --> 00:25:42,355
on an ARMv5, but it doesn't really work at all,

518
00:25:42,355 --> 00:25:44,276
so that was one start to death.

519
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:45,637
On iOS, things were a little bit different.

520
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,934
We had pretty solid sales for the first three to four days,

521
00:25:48,934 --> 00:25:51,516
and then suddenly I noticed sales drop off

522
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:53,877
and unique user count skyrocket,

523
00:25:53,877 --> 00:25:57,100
because we had been picked up by this amazing store

524
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:01,103
called Appulous, which gave games away for free.

525
00:26:01,103 --> 00:26:04,585
And so we pinned a lot of our success as a company on that,

526
00:26:04,585 --> 00:26:05,846
and it just did not pan out,

527
00:26:05,846 --> 00:26:07,488
because you can't predict these things.

528
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:10,390
Let me fast forward, though, to a couple years later.

529
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:16,824
I had been working, actually, for a bunch of really, really large mobile social studios

530
00:26:16,824 --> 00:26:21,845
like Zynga, making exciting stuff, and I'd gotten sick of that, so I decided to take

531
00:26:21,845 --> 00:26:25,726
the money and the skills they had given me and go make an independent game with some

532
00:26:25,726 --> 00:26:26,786
friends.

533
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:31,067
Breed Only Memories, we originally planned to take like eight months to make it.

534
00:26:31,067 --> 00:26:36,067
We realized super early on that content is very, very, very time-consuming to make, and

535
00:26:36,067 --> 00:26:38,048
so we re-scoped about two years out.

536
00:26:38,488 --> 00:26:44,351
And during this time, none of us were really crunched except near conferences.

537
00:26:44,351 --> 00:26:48,373
Most of us had savings to live off of because we weren't getting paid actively.

538
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:51,935
And we made something that I really value.

539
00:26:51,935 --> 00:26:55,537
Now, at the end of the day, this, to me, is a successful game.

540
00:26:55,537 --> 00:26:57,518
That said, I've not gotten much money from it.

541
00:26:57,518 --> 00:27:00,419
It sold pretty well, 273,000 copies, I think, on Steam alone.

542
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:03,461
But that money all goes somewhere.

543
00:27:03,461 --> 00:27:05,322
We had a huge number of folks to support.

544
00:27:05,322 --> 00:27:07,143
We had a lot of development time.

545
00:27:08,216 --> 00:27:11,817
I got to make this and be very happy with it, and now I work at Oculus because that's

546
00:27:11,817 --> 00:27:12,957
how it works.

547
00:27:12,957 --> 00:27:16,337
You make a thing out of love, and then you release it.

548
00:27:16,337 --> 00:27:20,338
Shameless plug, by the way, this is coming out on Switch soon, so feel free to check

549
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:21,438
that out.

550
00:27:21,438 --> 00:27:25,619
Anyways, some caveats here, because I don't want to end on a down note.

551
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:29,520
And hopefully, like you guys, if you've been reading into these things, it's not really

552
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,680
a down note.

553
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,700
There are things you can do still.

554
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,881
Definitely make games in your spare time.

555
00:27:35,982 --> 00:27:37,943
You should be doing that all the time.

556
00:27:37,943 --> 00:27:39,583
You should definitely be participating in jams

557
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:41,524
to do that as well.

558
00:27:41,524 --> 00:27:43,145
Make games in between jobs.

559
00:27:43,145 --> 00:27:44,966
It gives you a sense of regularity and purpose,

560
00:27:44,966 --> 00:27:47,087
and it lets you polish your skills.

561
00:27:47,087 --> 00:27:50,068
But also, more importantly, it gives you something

562
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:51,169
to show to future employers.

563
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,790
It was actually a very early version of a game with balls

564
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,251
that landed me my first gig.

565
00:27:55,251 --> 00:27:57,912
And I think that you should definitely

566
00:27:57,912 --> 00:27:59,052
be doing that for folks.

567
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:02,434
This is my content information up here.

568
00:28:02,434 --> 00:28:04,215
Feel free to take a picture of that or anything.

569
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:05,615
And if you have any questions.

570
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:10,421
Reach out to me. I will help you or if like if you're like I have a really are specific question

571
00:28:10,421 --> 00:28:13,683
I will get you in touch with someone that has gone through that same path

572
00:28:13,683 --> 00:28:19,706
Also, there are lots of programs that can help you out if you've made a VR game before

573
00:28:19,706 --> 00:28:23,949
We have a program called oculus start that's if you just google that you'll have all the confirmation

574
00:28:23,949 --> 00:28:25,890
We can get you hardware. We can get you support tickets

575
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:32,653
It's really great, and I'm doing this because I believe in all of you and just like you I want to power us all up together

576
00:28:32,653 --> 00:28:35,495
And I ran a little bit fast, but thank you so much
