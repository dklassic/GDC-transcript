1
00:00:07,844 --> 00:00:13,226
the lessons from our mistakes, what experience has taught us about leveling up our careers.

2
00:00:14,226 --> 00:00:15,327
So let's get started.

3
00:00:16,147 --> 00:00:26,771
So hi, I'm Dr. Jen Shi-Lei, a people strategy consultant who is deeply devoted to human sustainability and DEI initiatives.

4
00:00:27,832 --> 00:00:36,495
My passion is about managing community-based access programs that elevate marginalized voices and support divergent thinkers.

5
00:00:38,255 --> 00:00:46,499
I believe people grow best in the sunshine, and I hope these talks will provide some of that sunshine for you.

6
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,342
I'm going to yield most of my time to the panelists, but I do have a few things to say.

7
00:00:54,063 --> 00:00:55,144
Okay, so why are we here?

8
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,945
To lean into those mistakes.

9
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:06,910
My hope is to further break down those silos and the unhealthy aversion to speaking about mistakes.

10
00:01:08,547 --> 00:01:16,250
So I'm hoping that these mistakes that are shared will be fertile ground for all of us to grow the games industry and to be better.

11
00:01:17,591 --> 00:01:20,352
I appreciate the panels being up here and accepting my invitations.

12
00:01:22,013 --> 00:01:31,217
So they are here to speak about thriving in a tough, ever-evolving, and often scary industry.

13
00:01:34,068 --> 00:01:38,249
And at the core, each person on this panel cares deeply about people.

14
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:45,331
So I've invited them because I've witnessed each one of them working towards making the games industry better.

15
00:01:46,891 --> 00:01:50,232
And undoubtedly, I hope this information will be valuable for you.

16
00:01:51,352 --> 00:01:52,733
And to the audience, thank you for coming.

17
00:01:54,413 --> 00:01:56,394
By a show of hands, how many students do we have here?

18
00:01:56,914 --> 00:01:58,254
Just to gauge the room here.

19
00:01:59,514 --> 00:02:00,075
OK, great.

20
00:02:00,135 --> 00:02:00,495
Thank you.

21
00:02:00,715 --> 00:02:01,275
Decent amount.

22
00:02:02,582 --> 00:02:07,165
By show of hands, how many non-student job seekers out there?

23
00:02:08,126 --> 00:02:09,707
Okay, so a nice mix.

24
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:11,809
Career changers.

25
00:02:17,413 --> 00:02:21,055
People striving to be at least 1% better every day.

26
00:02:22,396 --> 00:02:23,557
Oh, come on, everybody.

27
00:02:25,148 --> 00:02:38,914
Okay, so my hope is that I've assembled a team of experienced devs that will allow you to leave this session with at least one actionable way to make a positive difference in the games industry and in your attempts to level up your career.

28
00:02:41,015 --> 00:02:45,237
For us in this room, we're privileged enough to be here.

29
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:50,820
But please, as you leave, share what you've learned with your devs back home.

30
00:02:52,688 --> 00:03:03,641
I want to acknowledge that there are people who cannot be here in person because of war, border restrictions, finances, caretaker obligations, and or layoffs.

31
00:03:05,123 --> 00:03:07,946
But I hope that this advice reaches them too.

32
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,331
March 22nd.

33
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:17,397
2024.

34
00:03:14,716 --> 00:03:17,397
Okay, so last day of GDC.

35
00:03:17,978 --> 00:03:20,800
This is also, this is my little tidbit here I get to add.

36
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,302
So this is actually the last day I updated my resume.

37
00:03:25,803 --> 00:03:32,628
And not just because I'm here at GDC, but because of the times that I've had to hand off a resume so quickly.

38
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:35,130
So that's my little tidbit for success.

39
00:03:36,631 --> 00:03:39,113
But I'm gonna yield most of my time to folks here.

40
00:03:39,213 --> 00:03:40,454
So speaking of success,

41
00:03:41,798 --> 00:03:47,703
Nurturing and resilience, they go hand in hand, and it is hard out there.

42
00:03:48,084 --> 00:03:51,287
And you will continue to be hard for the years to come.

43
00:03:51,887 --> 00:04:01,616
But I welcome to the podium my long-term friend, Tony, who will share about how, in the face of adversity, he found strategies to be resilient.

44
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:11,211
talk about

45
00:04:21,701 --> 00:04:27,543
Job search, resilience, and you, how to deal with the greatest hits of a job search and layoffs.

46
00:04:29,204 --> 00:04:41,329
A lot of this is all from anecdotal experience, and I understand that your mileage may vary, but these are all personal things that I've discovered, and I hope you get something out of it.

47
00:04:43,304 --> 00:04:44,605
So hi, I'm Tony.

48
00:04:45,025 --> 00:04:45,866
I'm a game designer.

49
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,128
I focus on systems and combat design.

50
00:04:48,828 --> 00:04:52,531
And I have worked in the games industry for more than 10 years.

51
00:04:53,071 --> 00:04:59,336
Some of the games I've worked on includes Diablo 3, Castleville, Deformers, and the Echo VR series.

52
00:05:01,558 --> 00:05:08,523
And the thing I want to talk about is four steps of job search, starting with the search.

53
00:05:09,644 --> 00:05:11,165
I think, for me,

54
00:05:12,197 --> 00:05:22,383
we sometimes lose focus and specific goal setting will help create proper expectations when it comes to accomplishing that goal.

55
00:05:24,044 --> 00:05:33,350
For example, I want to be able to successfully run a marathon in four hours and 45 minutes within six months.

56
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,992
Why do I put such a detail on all those things?

57
00:05:37,592 --> 00:05:38,113
Because

58
00:05:39,065 --> 00:05:58,129
It lets me know what I want to accomplish, run a marathon, which is 26 miles, 385 yards, a time frame, how long do I want to do it in, 4 hours, 45 minutes, and the amount of time that I have to prep for it, which is 6 months.

59
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:01,510
This gives you the ability

60
00:06:02,192 --> 00:06:09,216
to define specific steps you can now take towards accomplishing that goal.

61
00:06:09,656 --> 00:06:11,737
How many days do you have to run?

62
00:06:12,077 --> 00:06:15,479
How many miles do you need to run a day in order to accomplish that goal?

63
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:21,102
And also, better to be able to track your successes, and are you hitting those goals?

64
00:06:22,603 --> 00:06:26,765
And also, it helps you to evaluate if the goal is realistic or not.

65
00:06:27,366 --> 00:06:29,967
I could say, I want to run a marathon in a week.

66
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,262
Um, probably not likely.

67
00:06:34,463 --> 00:06:48,113
So my takeaway from this is if you set very, very realistic and very, very specific goals, you will be able to figure out what you can do to accomplish that goal.

68
00:06:48,573 --> 00:06:59,902
And the more realist, the more specific that goal is, the more you'll find that you are able to set steps to actually gauge whether you succeed or not on it.

69
00:07:00,768 --> 00:07:03,770
And by the way, I know it's tough out there.

70
00:07:04,371 --> 00:07:15,238
The average job search time right now, from what I was able to sort of do a brief search on the internet, is like five to six months on the average.

71
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,121
So that's not nothing.

72
00:07:19,561 --> 00:07:21,703
So that is a fact.

73
00:07:23,244 --> 00:07:25,545
And now, let's talk about dealing with rejection.

74
00:07:25,685 --> 00:07:34,166
I think following the job search, we find something, we apply to something, we will always, well, some of us will end up with rejections.

75
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:45,509
This is an excerpt from my own job search Excel, and the reds are the rejections, and the grays are the times that I got ghosted.

76
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:48,850
And that is just a little excerpt of it.

77
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:49,870
So as you can see,

78
00:07:50,606 --> 00:07:51,767
It's not just you.

79
00:07:51,947 --> 00:07:53,247
This happens to everyone.

80
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:59,871
And the biggest thing is, when rejection happens, chances are you won't know why most of the time.

81
00:08:03,973 --> 00:08:06,995
It is important to try to get feedback.

82
00:08:07,595 --> 00:08:13,058
And sometimes, not all companies are willing to give feedback, but you do have the ability to ask.

83
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:27,280
And any chance that you do get feedback from a company, you should analyze the feedback, break it down, and take what you can out of it and act on that action, make it an action item.

84
00:08:31,383 --> 00:08:43,112
And while there are definitive stats in rejections, according to a survey, I think most people, most successful applicants,

85
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:49,393
that applies for 10 to 15 jobs usually get 6 to 10 rejections.

86
00:08:49,894 --> 00:08:52,876
So rejection is like above 50%, right?

87
00:08:53,356 --> 00:08:55,158
Don't take it personally, it happens.

88
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,302
Well, while you're on a job hunt, what can you do?

89
00:09:01,995 --> 00:09:03,316
Well, you can improve.

90
00:09:03,937 --> 00:09:06,879
And what you want to strive is to be better daily.

91
00:09:08,221 --> 00:09:10,843
It's easy to get into the downward spiral of a job search.

92
00:09:11,764 --> 00:09:15,167
There are only so many job applications you can apply in a day.

93
00:09:15,727 --> 00:09:19,210
And then you end up sort of doom schooling for more jobs.

94
00:09:19,911 --> 00:09:25,496
Instead of doing that, you should find things to work on and continue to improve yourself during your down times.

95
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,188
This helped me utilize my downtime as a way to improve myself.

96
00:09:31,948 --> 00:09:39,891
And what I did is I created a daily schedule that included time to work on things that will help me improve myself in any way.

97
00:09:39,951 --> 00:09:44,632
This could be a health goal, this could be a future goal, work goal, or this could be a hobby.

98
00:09:45,773 --> 00:09:47,933
You don't know what will actually help you improve.

99
00:09:48,574 --> 00:09:56,496
And I think any bit of improvement will help you maintain sanity and also feel productive, which is very important during this time.

100
00:09:59,067 --> 00:10:00,949
Lastly, let's talk about deservingness.

101
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:07,557
It's really hard to deal with the success of those around you, especially when you're on the job search, right?

102
00:10:07,577 --> 00:10:11,702
You look around and people have announced that they've got something and whatnot.

103
00:10:12,305 --> 00:10:19,749
And my takeaway is, very much like social media, you often don't get the full picture of what happens.

104
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:24,331
And this is especially true when it comes to the story of, air quotes, success.

105
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:29,994
Being disappointed at the accomplishment of others will not help you in any way.

106
00:10:30,295 --> 00:10:33,396
And actually, it mentally damages you and makes it hard.

107
00:10:33,997 --> 00:10:39,299
So focus on the positives and be happy for success in general.

108
00:10:41,211 --> 00:10:52,740
And what you'll find often is that sometimes the people who achieve success before you, and if you maintain the friendships and the connections, will be able to somehow help you farther down the road.

109
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:56,422
So let's do a quick recap.

110
00:10:57,363 --> 00:10:58,064
Focus goals.

111
00:10:58,784 --> 00:10:59,705
Rejection happens.

112
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:01,086
Be better daily.

113
00:11:01,886 --> 00:11:02,787
Remain positive.

114
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:09,612
I tried to come up with a cool acronym, but I ended up with a real weird word, so that didn't work for me.

115
00:11:09,692 --> 00:11:10,573
But you get the idea.

116
00:11:12,816 --> 00:11:19,181
And finally, we are all aware it is dangerous out there and it's not great, right?

117
00:11:19,521 --> 00:11:25,866
We don't know what someone else is going through because we're not in their head, but we can be kind and support each other.

118
00:11:27,107 --> 00:11:30,930
Final thoughts, for anyone who needs to hear this, you are good enough.

119
00:11:31,811 --> 00:11:32,111
Thank you.

120
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:48,368
We absolutely did need to hear that, Tony, so thank you.

121
00:11:49,228 --> 00:11:57,931
And now I welcome to the podium a dear friend whom I've had the pleasure of working with in Europe and visiting in two countries in Asia.

122
00:11:58,931 --> 00:12:04,152
And I invite Ndinda to share her stories that she's benefited from studying and working abroad.

123
00:12:10,789 --> 00:12:11,190
Thank you.

124
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,814
So I'm Adinda... Sorry.

125
00:12:15,094 --> 00:12:16,476
Oh, it's the room.

126
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:17,698
It's the room, people.

127
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:20,221
I'm Adinda van Ooster from the Netherlands.

128
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:25,448
I'm a game journalist, a teacher and international relations specialist at Deltuin College.

129
00:12:26,255 --> 00:12:46,113
I had the fortunate experience to owe in exchange between my studies, yeah don't be jealous at this list by the way, to have a full-time internship at UserJoy, a game company in Taiwan, to do a game design research master in Germany, and to work one year as a course creator at Lingling University in Hong Kong.

130
00:12:47,870 --> 00:13:04,665
So Jen earlier asked who is all the students in the room, and well, speaking to the moment that I was 17, I went to Hong Kong for the first time, and many international trips followed.

131
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:20,110
My decision to go overseas was like at this moment I realized from time to time new employers really liked it that I went overseas because they see the experiences that I got with it, they really liked it.

132
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:26,612
So basically because I went abroad I get later on a lot of advantages.

133
00:13:27,052 --> 00:13:28,133
And I'm not the only one.

134
00:13:28,514 --> 00:13:38,085
There was a recent mass qualitative study from Erasmus Plus that showed that going abroad has a long-term influence on your life.

135
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:46,836
97% of all participants confirmed a positive influence on your life and 90% on the career path.

136
00:13:48,313 --> 00:13:53,840
So for my internship, I wanted to go to Taiwan, but I had no clue to start.

137
00:13:55,442 --> 00:13:56,103
It was not easy.

138
00:13:56,183 --> 00:14:01,349
I went on the website and checking all the emails I could find for the companies.

139
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:04,393
And of course, no response.

140
00:14:05,714 --> 00:14:31,164
and the deadline of getting an internship was getting closer and closer and I really didn't want to do an internship in the Netherlands because that's boring so I started to pick up the phone and just call them and one of the ladies that picked up the phone explained to me that it was not because well they most likely hadn't seen my email but it was so much paperwork

141
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:36,745
to let me come to the company, and also was cultural difference, and so on.

142
00:14:37,225 --> 00:14:47,627
So at the moment of all those emails' rejection, I realized, because I didn't give up, I was kind of like forcing them to just hire me, basically, as an intern.

143
00:14:48,448 --> 00:14:58,109
It wasn't about like they were rejecting me, but they were rejecting someone else coming because of paperwork, and I was a foreigner, which is weird.

144
00:14:59,690 --> 00:14:59,850
So.

145
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:03,451
Not everyone in this room is a student.

146
00:15:03,991 --> 00:15:09,192
And I believe that personal growth always goes with going abroad.

147
00:15:09,312 --> 00:15:11,853
I mean, you can do it other ways, but I really believe that.

148
00:15:12,933 --> 00:15:16,754
For me, it changed a lot of my own self-esteem.

149
00:15:17,654 --> 00:15:23,095
I pushed my boundaries, and I learned to communicate with people from all over the world.

150
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:30,497
And I grew an amazing network, which is still really instrumental in my career today.

151
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:35,699
And I have many cool stories to tell, I tell you.

152
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:40,361
But not now, but over a beer, you can ask me any weird stories.

153
00:15:40,561 --> 00:15:41,141
It's really cool.

154
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:43,382
Really, it's best benefits ever.

155
00:15:43,862 --> 00:15:50,384
So at this moment, we are in a time that going remote is getting more popular and more common.

156
00:15:50,804 --> 00:15:57,507
So a research by Hipmarker shows that at this moment, the remote job is very good.

157
00:15:58,107 --> 00:16:07,571
And even still now, because we're having a dire time, it has 360 remote jobs open on their website when I last checked, which was last week.

158
00:16:09,448 --> 00:16:12,970
There are different ways to start to work overseas.

159
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,811
Please talk to me after this talk.

160
00:16:17,252 --> 00:16:19,713
I can unravel what you want to know.

161
00:16:20,994 --> 00:16:23,715
Because this is going to be another talk.

162
00:16:24,115 --> 00:16:25,036
We don't have time.

163
00:16:25,396 --> 00:16:31,579
So, as I mentioned, I studied and worked in several countries overseas.

164
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:36,822
And I learned that research, doing research, is really important.

165
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:42,206
because every single country has their really little nitty-gritty details.

166
00:16:43,327 --> 00:16:45,808
Visas, injections, whatsoever.

167
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:51,072
I really like this website that you see on the side.

168
00:16:51,793 --> 00:17:01,120
Any visas, check before you go which country you go because it just prevents so much stress to know things beforehand.

169
00:17:02,277 --> 00:17:06,159
So Jen mentioned already the resumes earlier.

170
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:13,283
I want to say that apart from visas, resumes also have a lot of different things.

171
00:17:13,403 --> 00:17:18,006
There are different countries with different personal information descriptions.

172
00:17:18,126 --> 00:17:21,068
Some countries like your photograph, some don't.

173
00:17:21,768 --> 00:17:24,050
Your length can be different, the structure.

174
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:31,992
And maybe, I mean, I'm in America, but I hear that maybe you don't know what an A4 is.

175
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:39,734
Well, please, if you don't, search it, because it's really good to show that you understand the culture.

176
00:17:40,054 --> 00:17:45,695
You show employers that you take that extra step, and that is super important.

177
00:17:46,555 --> 00:17:54,117
And of course, our world is getting globalized, and people understand there are differences, but it is really that extra little amount that

178
00:17:55,097 --> 00:17:58,779
makes your employer realize that you are taking them serious.

179
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:05,543
So making a decision to work overseas is a big one.

180
00:18:05,763 --> 00:18:08,144
I mean, I can keep talking about this for an hour.

181
00:18:08,484 --> 00:18:09,465
Please, I shouldn't.

182
00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:14,007
So before that, you should make a SWOT analysis.

183
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:18,689
So write down your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.

184
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:25,715
So for me, for example, I had education.

185
00:18:26,915 --> 00:18:33,978
I wanted to teach in Taiwan and Hong Kong, but I said I need a master.

186
00:18:34,298 --> 00:18:36,779
So these kind of things can differ from countries.

187
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:40,721
Your portfolio is still really important in our community.

188
00:18:42,161 --> 00:18:44,002
Don't forget it, apart from the resume.

189
00:18:45,562 --> 00:18:50,744
And I already learned the language, so I already could speak some Chinese.

190
00:18:50,784 --> 00:18:57,207
So for yourself, write down what are your internal strengths and weaknesses, and get it noted.

191
00:18:57,767 --> 00:19:03,569
Because you should also note what are your external strengths and weaknesses.

192
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:05,970
the things that you don't have control on.

193
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:13,014
So this is going to be a package of text, but it will foster out where you want to go.

194
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:21,760
So I want to stress that working abroad, especially when moving to a new place, is not an easy decision.

195
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,021
A lot of things need to be considered.

196
00:19:24,741 --> 00:19:29,744
But I invite you to think about all the new possibilities that comes along with it.

197
00:19:30,645 --> 00:19:30,945
Thank you.

198
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:41,343
I appreciate your international perspective, Adinda.

199
00:19:43,966 --> 00:19:46,468
Now I'm excited for Angela's talk.

200
00:19:47,309 --> 00:20:01,063
I've seen Angela work closely with so many mentees in early phases of job preparation, helping them to decode job applications for goodness of fit, and Angela renews my optimism and

201
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:08,013
She pushes boundaries of my thinking and of the mentees that she's working with in such creative approaches.

202
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:09,573
So I look forward to your talk, Angela.

203
00:20:17,897 --> 00:20:18,257
Hello.

204
00:20:19,157 --> 00:20:22,919
Welcome to Life Lessons from the Hunt, the job hunt.

205
00:20:24,693 --> 00:20:25,334
So who am I?

206
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:33,260
Hi, I'm Angela Geis, pronouns she, they, and I'm currently an associate sound designer at NetherRealm Studios in Chicago.

207
00:20:34,081 --> 00:20:35,602
I did not go to school for games.

208
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:37,063
I am self-taught.

209
00:20:37,263 --> 00:20:44,209
And two years ago, I was in the middle of my own job search, learning and putting all of these tips and tricks to use.

210
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:48,192
These are my stories about the things that worked for me.

211
00:20:48,753 --> 00:20:50,975
So please take or leave them as you see fit.

212
00:20:52,955 --> 00:20:56,899
So throughout my time applying for jobs, these are the four big lessons that I learned.

213
00:20:57,379 --> 00:21:04,266
I'm going to share two with you, and then Tony and Trento are going to do a deeper dive onto the last two.

214
00:21:05,948 --> 00:21:09,091
First one will be do your due diligence research.

215
00:21:10,612 --> 00:21:11,513
Network maintenance.

216
00:21:12,794 --> 00:21:13,555
Welcome back to these.

217
00:21:15,352 --> 00:21:19,156
and then expect nothing, prepare for everything.

218
00:21:19,876 --> 00:21:24,421
Do the work to make sure you are ready for the just in cases like an interview.

219
00:21:24,861 --> 00:21:34,831
But if you send off every application with an expectation of success or even a response, it will only drain your energy and enthusiasm.

220
00:21:35,952 --> 00:21:38,735
And you already heard Tony talk about this.

221
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:46,781
And my favorite piece of advice, be your ambitious, passionate, and genuine self.

222
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:50,402
Because this is the only person you can be.

223
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:58,823
And actors know, and I learned in my theater career, that you shine the brightest when you are your most genuine self.

224
00:21:59,623 --> 00:22:04,484
And that's what draws people in, which Trento will be talking a little bit about later.

225
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,365
So due diligence research.

226
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:13,251
Common advice is to know the company that you're applying for.

227
00:22:13,871 --> 00:22:19,553
I found that the most critical aspect for me was to know as much as you can about who you're talking to.

228
00:22:20,153 --> 00:22:28,936
So search the company, see if you can tell the size, what they're known for, the games they make, the team composition, and who you might be working with or talking to.

229
00:22:29,637 --> 00:22:33,398
If you can't find something, that would be something good to ask in the interview.

230
00:22:34,988 --> 00:22:55,702
Don't be like me, who is woefully uneducated in mainstream anything except, like, JRPGs and audio, and panics whenever someone from Larian Studios walks up and introduces themselves and I can't pinpoint exactly what game I'm supposed to know them from and that I can connect and chat about them with.

231
00:22:56,823 --> 00:23:00,085
The multi-award winning game of the year, Baldur's Gate 3.

232
00:23:01,726 --> 00:23:02,707
I do know Baldur's Gate 3.

233
00:23:04,698 --> 00:23:06,099
So next, network maintenance.

234
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:09,561
Networking is making friends.

235
00:23:10,321 --> 00:23:11,022
Keep it simple.

236
00:23:11,502 --> 00:23:12,222
Keep it chill.

237
00:23:12,522 --> 00:23:13,223
Keep it calm.

238
00:23:13,943 --> 00:23:22,688
If you think about networking like this, it helps lower the pressure you put on yourself, and it helps you to be more confident and easy to approach and talk to.

239
00:23:25,022 --> 00:23:31,224
After meeting someone, use Discord, Twitter, LinkedIn, whatever you like, to reach out and reconnect occasionally.

240
00:23:32,365 --> 00:23:35,986
I saw this thing, and it reminded me of this conversation we had at GDC.

241
00:23:36,566 --> 00:23:38,487
I played your game, and I loved the music.

242
00:23:39,027 --> 00:23:41,528
This is important for keeping friendships.

243
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:47,230
Having professional friends locally can be a game changer.

244
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:51,331
If people are easier to get to, they're easier to keep in touch with.

245
00:23:53,618 --> 00:23:56,580
and if you can't think of anything else to say, send a meme.

246
00:23:58,021 --> 00:24:00,824
Appropriate work safe memes, please.

247
00:24:02,485 --> 00:24:09,690
For example, when the winter storm hits in Chicago, you can send this to the Mortal Kombat team.

248
00:24:14,073 --> 00:24:18,297
Last, the last most important thing about network maintenance

249
00:24:20,383 --> 00:24:24,985
So I asked a few lovely folk for their experience in the job hunt around the world.

250
00:24:25,366 --> 00:24:33,570
I pulled these quotes from their answers about finding jobs in the UK, Sweden, South Africa, Indonesia, and Canada.

251
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:48,578
And though they all have wildly different experiences, their answers to me showcase a through line that even in the international context, the most important thing for any job hunt is to talk to people and build relationships.

252
00:24:49,913 --> 00:24:53,556
So if you'll indulge me, look to your left.

253
00:24:55,377 --> 00:24:56,058
Look to your right.

254
00:24:57,459 --> 00:25:01,542
These people next to you, they could become your new best friends.

255
00:25:02,223 --> 00:25:03,164
Your future boss.

256
00:25:03,704 --> 00:25:04,725
Your coworkers.

257
00:25:05,345 --> 00:25:08,508
Someone who will help you navigate your next obstacle with.

258
00:25:09,028 --> 00:25:11,570
Or someone you'll just smile in the hallway after this.

259
00:25:12,531 --> 00:25:15,954
Maybe introduce yourself after the talk.

260
00:25:19,007 --> 00:25:29,053
OK, my final and greatest piece of advice is to do your best to relax so that you can be your genuine self and to put your best foot forward.

261
00:25:29,873 --> 00:25:32,975
There is only so much that's under your control.

262
00:25:33,736 --> 00:25:36,958
At some point, you've prepared for everything.

263
00:25:37,838 --> 00:25:41,620
All you can do now, now it's out of your hands.

264
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:46,302
The only thing left to do is make sure there aren't any red flags.

265
00:25:47,223 --> 00:25:51,205
So I ran across this quote recently in Rob Bridget's book about audio.

266
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:52,326
I'm an audio person.

267
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:53,306
I make everything audio.

268
00:25:54,247 --> 00:25:56,888
I really love the quote, though, so I'm making it apply here.

269
00:25:58,689 --> 00:26:05,452
The thing about bullets is you can dodge the easy ones, but not the others, and you cannot dodge them all.

270
00:26:07,714 --> 00:26:12,275
Dodge the easy bullets, the telltale signs, and leave the others in the hands of fate.

271
00:26:12,895 --> 00:26:15,196
There's nothing you can do about those anyways.

272
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:17,276
You did your work.

273
00:26:18,056 --> 00:26:18,957
You put in the effort.

274
00:26:19,317 --> 00:26:21,317
You have prepared what you can.

275
00:26:21,937 --> 00:26:23,578
You've dodged the nastiest bullets.

276
00:26:24,318 --> 00:26:30,899
Now sit back down, have some tea, and let the winds take you where they will.

277
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:33,720
Thank you.

278
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,522
I'm supposed to keep track of time, but I get so lost in these stories.

279
00:26:47,642 --> 00:26:48,562
Thank you for sharing that.

280
00:26:48,682 --> 00:26:49,402
That was incredible.

281
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:55,325
And I want to emphasize that last part about the relax.

282
00:26:55,806 --> 00:26:56,626
It's really important.

283
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:59,448
We stress out so much about trying to get that next job.

284
00:27:00,428 --> 00:27:02,429
So in a moment, we're going to hear from Fauzi.

285
00:27:03,149 --> 00:27:08,072
And I didn't invite him here because of his title, but because he cares about people.

286
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:19,570
When I've asked people to join this panel, I was looking for people who've been inspired, who support international communities.

287
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:31,321
So I manage a team in Europe, and I've seen through action, Fawzi supporting us, helping to elevate people finding their best job fit.

288
00:27:32,242 --> 00:27:33,343
So welcome to the podium, Fawzi.

289
00:27:41,091 --> 00:27:42,853
Thank you so much for the humbling introduction.

290
00:27:42,893 --> 00:27:43,573
Hello, everybody.

291
00:27:43,613 --> 00:27:44,054
Marhaba.

292
00:27:44,114 --> 00:27:44,995
My name is Fauzi.

293
00:27:48,538 --> 00:27:52,022
21 years in the business in game design and creative direction roles.

294
00:27:52,562 --> 00:27:55,465
I'm currently the VP of global creative at Ubisoft.

295
00:27:55,985 --> 00:28:03,893
So I oversee and help creative teams across Europe bring their creative visions to life.

296
00:28:05,574 --> 00:28:11,295
I'm XCA, XKing, and other companies shipped a bunch of games from Mario Rabbids to Star Wars to Battlefields.

297
00:28:12,376 --> 00:28:18,337
And I'm on the Board of Education for Future Games, which is one of the leading schools in Sweden.

298
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:26,359
And I wrote Al-Khallab, An Art of Game Design, one of the first books, if not the first one, to be written about game design in Arabic.

299
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:30,720
And I just got the Ambassador Award a couple of days ago.

300
00:28:34,177 --> 00:28:35,097
Thank you, thank you.

301
00:28:36,098 --> 00:28:39,539
So I've been asked to do two very difficult tasks.

302
00:28:39,699 --> 00:28:43,021
One of them is to recount all of my mistakes in five minutes, which is impossible.

303
00:28:43,341 --> 00:28:44,501
I could have been here for a long time.

304
00:28:45,101 --> 00:28:47,662
And also to speak only for five minutes, which is also impossible.

305
00:28:47,682 --> 00:28:49,243
I tend to like to do that quite a bit.

306
00:28:49,263 --> 00:28:50,484
So I'm going to try my best here.

307
00:28:51,224 --> 00:28:53,765
And Dr. Jen, you can always kick me when I'm over time.

308
00:28:55,446 --> 00:28:57,106
And I've also listened to Angela's advice.

309
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:58,647
There's a lot of memes in this presentation.

310
00:29:00,595 --> 00:29:10,159
So I want to walk you through some very anecdotal stuff that happened to me early on in my career, some mistakes that I believe that I made, or tough stuff that I've been through, so hopefully you don't have to.

311
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,481
I started my career in Jordan, and here we go, this is one of the first tough ones.

312
00:29:14,521 --> 00:29:17,002
If you can help it, try to be born somewhere with an industry.

313
00:29:17,243 --> 00:29:17,703
It makes sense.

314
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:21,368
It makes things a lot more easier for you.

315
00:29:22,589 --> 00:29:35,343
But if you can't control where you're born, consider relocating entirely to be close to the industry where there are schools, where there are companies, where there are places where you can join, and people that have done the stuff that you can learn from.

316
00:29:35,963 --> 00:29:37,045
Or otherwise, do what I did.

317
00:29:37,085 --> 00:29:39,948
You keep learning, doing the things, make mistakes, and pick up from them.

318
00:29:43,646 --> 00:29:47,369
My first project, for example, me and my friends, this is me when I had hair.

319
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:57,117
We started our own studio, there were nine of us, and we started working on the vertical slides for a Game Boy Advance RPG of the time, one of the first of its kind in the region.

320
00:29:57,137 --> 00:29:59,439
And there's a lot of mistakes in the sentence that I just mentioned.

321
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:20,295
Because if you can join an already existing team or company so that you can learn from their experience, even if it's not the type of game you want to work on or the type of project you were dreaming to join the industry to do, you get to learn what it's like to be in a game team, you get to learn what it's like to work on a game, and you get to learn from those people's mistakes, and that will make things a lot easier.

322
00:30:20,805 --> 00:30:23,926
a lot easier for you when you actually get to work on the stuff that you like.

323
00:30:24,266 --> 00:30:28,187
You get to see what it's really like to be on the ground in a studio, regardless of its size.

324
00:30:28,967 --> 00:30:32,048
But if you do want to start your own studio, we started as nine people.

325
00:30:32,108 --> 00:30:34,528
I would probably say you don't want it to be a large team.

326
00:30:34,888 --> 00:30:44,431
Something like anything over five people, as you can imagine, will cause a lot of complexity, especially when it comes to coordination, communication, unifying the vision, and not to mention cost.

327
00:30:44,951 --> 00:30:47,271
It's really hard to get five people to agree what to have for lunch.

328
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:50,112
Imagine if you have to get more people involved.

329
00:30:51,653 --> 00:30:57,378
And also, like, don't start with an RPG, you know, or a relatively large project.

330
00:30:58,219 --> 00:31:01,281
What you want from your first project is that you want to finish it.

331
00:31:02,582 --> 00:31:08,908
You start with something that is the smallest possible so you can learn, finish, and then move on to the next one.

332
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:11,991
Grow your skills one project at a time.

333
00:31:14,012 --> 00:31:17,533
And also, try not to let your first project be your magnum opus.

334
00:31:18,693 --> 00:31:23,835
If you just started running, it would be ridiculous if I asked you to win the golden medal in the Olympics.

335
00:31:25,616 --> 00:31:30,297
Making games, just like any other skill, is something that you grow.

336
00:31:30,957 --> 00:31:34,698
So you show up every day, and you do the work, and you grow your skills.

337
00:31:35,238 --> 00:31:40,060
One day, you will have the skills and the personal insight to make that magnum opus.

338
00:31:42,988 --> 00:32:08,257
And so when my first project inevitably failed We were never able to finish it and release that I took that very hard on myself and almost left the business altogether And here's one of the bigger mistakes is I was not kind to myself, you know And you really need to be kind to yourself because putting a lot of stress on trying and tying your failure to your ability to continue in your career is a sure pathway to burnout and

339
00:32:10,067 --> 00:32:13,649
So, you know, fail fast, move on, be kind to yourselves.

340
00:32:13,929 --> 00:32:15,650
Mistakes are part of the learning process.

341
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:21,972
And even though I'm here standing telling you about the mistakes I made, they are part of who I am and why I'm standing here in front of you today.

342
00:32:23,113 --> 00:32:23,913
I have not failed.

343
00:32:24,033 --> 00:32:25,894
I have tried 10,000 ways that did not work.

344
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:31,191
And when I was in an indie team, I was wearing many hats.

345
00:32:31,952 --> 00:32:32,932
I could write music.

346
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:33,613
I could code.

347
00:32:33,653 --> 00:32:34,553
I could do 2D art.

348
00:32:34,593 --> 00:32:37,015
I could do UI, level design, and all kinds of stuff.

349
00:32:37,475 --> 00:32:39,656
So therefore, I thought I qualified for all of this.

350
00:32:39,836 --> 00:32:45,179
So I started applying to all of these jobs, from particle effects to level design to game design.

351
00:32:45,719 --> 00:32:49,041
And at some point, I was getting more rejection letters than there were days in the month.

352
00:32:50,742 --> 00:32:52,663
And that's a mistake.

353
00:32:52,823 --> 00:32:56,085
So what you want to do is that you

354
00:32:57,365 --> 00:32:59,106
I see a lot of people make the same mistake.

355
00:32:59,787 --> 00:33:09,853
And while it's great to explore so that you can finally pick the area that works for you, and where you find your heart in, ultimately, you need to focus your efforts.

356
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:15,336
There are only so many hours in the day, and you're growing your skills, as we spoke about earlier.

357
00:33:15,737 --> 00:33:19,499
Having a defined focus allows you to focus on the time and the results.

358
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:21,620
So be result-oriented.

359
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,803
Visualize the end goal, and then pour all of your effort towards it.

360
00:33:27,855 --> 00:33:30,096
What is the skill set that you want to grow?

361
00:33:30,737 --> 00:33:33,618
And how can I focus on learning that skill set that I'm missing?

362
00:33:34,439 --> 00:33:43,284
What are the knowledge gaps, behavioral changes, and experience gaps that I need to add to my skill set to be able to be on my path to my end goal?

363
00:33:44,504 --> 00:33:47,126
I'm going to ask you a couple of questions for you to ponder on.

364
00:33:47,546 --> 00:33:48,947
Who in the industry inspires you?

365
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:52,349
What do they have that you don't?

366
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:54,550
And how do you get it?

367
00:33:57,342 --> 00:33:58,042
Simple example.

368
00:33:59,463 --> 00:34:03,105
Say that you want to work on Company X. Company X probably has employees.

369
00:34:03,445 --> 00:34:08,668
Those employees have employee internet presence, portfolio, LinkedIn profiles, etc.

370
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:10,329
Have a look.

371
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:15,152
See what are the things that made them employable for that employer that you really want to work with.

372
00:34:16,113 --> 00:34:18,354
How can you get your portfolio similar to this?

373
00:34:18,794 --> 00:34:23,577
What are the skills, the behaviors, the experience that you need to grow to match?

374
00:34:27,041 --> 00:34:31,002
And the only thing I didn't do wrong is that I wanted to persevere, no matter what.

375
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:33,943
No matter the setbacks, I knew what I wanted to go.

376
00:34:34,163 --> 00:34:35,543
There was a person that inspires me.

377
00:34:35,743 --> 00:34:38,284
I knew the skill set that I wanted to grow, and I persevered.

378
00:34:38,564 --> 00:34:42,025
You show up every day, and you do the work, but you be kind to yourself.

379
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:46,166
So to summarize my advice to you, you show up every day.

380
00:34:46,646 --> 00:34:47,426
You do the work.

381
00:34:48,226 --> 00:34:49,727
You pick projects that you can finish.

382
00:34:50,447 --> 00:34:54,128
You don't overestimate your skills and underestimate your projects.

383
00:34:55,723 --> 00:35:04,245
you go to where the jobs are, you become undeniable by making yourself desirable for the roles you want, and you be kind to yourself.

384
00:35:05,725 --> 00:35:06,365
Thank you very much.

385
00:35:16,968 --> 00:35:23,189
Fauzi, I think your message of being kind to ourselves segues perfectly to an inspiring and important talk

386
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,693
from Trento about authenticity.

387
00:35:27,174 --> 00:35:27,795
Thank you, Trento.

388
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:38,832
I didn't trip on the way up here, so that's a great start.

389
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,320
Hello, everyone.

390
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,161
My name is Trento von Lindenburg.

391
00:35:43,421 --> 00:35:47,222
I'm the CEO of Mole Breaker Interactive, a new company founded in November 2023.

392
00:35:47,642 --> 00:35:49,202
And sorry, Fawzi, we didn't take your advice.

393
00:35:49,322 --> 00:35:50,443
We are a 10-person studio.

394
00:35:51,243 --> 00:35:53,344
So we'll see how that one turns out in a year.

395
00:35:54,544 --> 00:36:01,046
But a year ago, I was in the same position that at least a third of you were, where I was looking for a new job.

396
00:36:02,306 --> 00:36:04,667
And four years ago, I had just graduated.

397
00:36:06,105 --> 00:36:16,932
So today I'd like to talk to you a bit about the mistakes that led me to where I am today in my first few jobs, and why the importance of being authentic matters, especially in landing the job that's right for you.

398
00:36:19,154 --> 00:36:22,796
Now, as a quick note, there is no magic solution.

399
00:36:23,817 --> 00:36:27,219
Nothing that I say today will get you hired tomorrow.

400
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,942
And trust me, I wish I could.

401
00:36:32,863 --> 00:36:33,083
Nothing.

402
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:45,194
But I hope that you can learn from my mistakes and that in listening to what we're about to share, that the job that you do get will be the right one for you.

403
00:36:46,435 --> 00:36:48,516
So let's talk about my mistake.

404
00:36:49,456 --> 00:36:49,996
One of them, at least.

405
00:36:50,916 --> 00:36:53,437
And specifically, my mistaken approach to interviews.

406
00:36:55,235 --> 00:37:02,877
We've all heard the recommendations of, you have to make sure you review exactly everything that's on the application page.

407
00:37:03,317 --> 00:37:04,817
Look at what they're saying, what they want on their resumes.

408
00:37:04,897 --> 00:37:06,097
Edit your resume to the skills.

409
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:11,199
Do everything to be the perfect person that they want because there's thousands of people competing for that job.

410
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:12,339
We've all heard that, right?

411
00:37:14,919 --> 00:37:18,520
And while that is true, you do want to develop your skills towards something.

412
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:22,081
What can often feel like is, I have to edit myself.

413
00:37:23,568 --> 00:37:27,430
I had to be and sell something that I am not entirely comfortable being.

414
00:37:28,951 --> 00:37:31,913
And you start to say things in interviews that maybe you don't really feel and think.

415
00:37:32,954 --> 00:37:39,178
At least for me, one thing that I often hid was, I really, really care about work-life balance.

416
00:37:39,378 --> 00:37:40,939
I want to protect my team above all else.

417
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:42,780
No, I'm not going to stay here until 8 p.m.

418
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:47,883
every day or work on Saturdays, because I have hobbies and passions outside of this that I care about.

419
00:37:49,127 --> 00:37:51,288
Instead, when asked, would you be willing to pull an all-nighter?

420
00:37:52,128 --> 00:37:53,649
Would you be willing to work over hours?

421
00:37:55,309 --> 00:37:58,591
Are you willing to do everything and anything you can to make the best product possible?

422
00:37:58,671 --> 00:37:59,071
I'd say yes.

423
00:37:59,931 --> 00:38:00,091
Yep.

424
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:00,892
Yes.

425
00:38:04,053 --> 00:38:07,274
But that inevitably led to the realization I made the wrong career choice.

426
00:38:08,775 --> 00:38:12,076
That I would land myself in a culture where I didn't fit in.

427
00:38:12,576 --> 00:38:16,758
I sold myself as this person that they wanted, but not who I wanted to be.

428
00:38:18,665 --> 00:38:20,246
And I did this because I was desperate for a job.

429
00:38:21,026 --> 00:38:22,247
I needed something.

430
00:38:24,729 --> 00:38:28,351
Even if it landed me somewhere I really, really didn't want to be.

431
00:38:30,532 --> 00:38:31,713
So eventually, I burnt out.

432
00:38:32,013 --> 00:38:32,393
I left.

433
00:38:32,794 --> 00:38:34,254
I couldn't take that job for more than a year.

434
00:38:35,095 --> 00:38:36,996
And I decided it was time to approach with a new tact.

435
00:38:39,237 --> 00:38:40,958
I started with interviewing the interviewer.

436
00:38:42,399 --> 00:38:43,380
We'll get on that one in a second.

437
00:38:45,385 --> 00:38:52,690
and realizing that I had to be truly authentic and let my inner gremlin, the thing that I was afraid of showing, show.

438
00:38:54,611 --> 00:38:56,032
Let's start with interview the interviewer.

439
00:38:57,711 --> 00:39:02,416
I'll share a similar thing to what Tony shared earlier and say, I applied to over 275 jobs last year.

440
00:39:02,436 --> 00:39:04,338
These are the only ones that I had tracked.

441
00:39:04,358 --> 00:39:17,633
And we're going to ignore the fact that I got rejected or ghosted from all but three of them and focus on the fact that even though I was being authentic and answering and asking all the questions I possibly could, I still got three offers.

442
00:39:20,228 --> 00:39:22,550
I also turned down those three offers.

443
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:26,132
Because I asked them questions like, what's your production philosophy?

444
00:39:26,712 --> 00:39:27,973
What do you care the most about?

445
00:39:28,373 --> 00:39:31,295
What is something that you can't stand about this job and you would change?

446
00:39:32,356 --> 00:39:33,617
The answers I got were not satisfying.

447
00:39:33,757 --> 00:39:39,681
They had me realize, wow, even if I get this job, I actually really don't want to work here.

448
00:39:41,282 --> 00:39:49,647
And even in this economy, that meant that I saved myself possibly getting laid off within the first three months or getting burnt out all over again and possibly leaving industry entirely.

449
00:39:52,001 --> 00:39:54,982
Being authentic, on the other hand, can mean a number of things.

450
00:39:55,902 --> 00:39:59,264
It can mean telling the truth and being honest with what matters to you.

451
00:40:00,484 --> 00:40:04,526
It can mean sharing your flaws and being able to articulate your growth.

452
00:40:05,866 --> 00:40:09,427
This is what people mean when they say, don't be afraid of being honest about the mistakes that you have made.

453
00:40:10,188 --> 00:40:12,528
As a hiring manager, I want to hear that.

454
00:40:12,949 --> 00:40:16,890
That will tell me more than anything about the thousands upon thousands of successes that we share every single day.

455
00:40:19,243 --> 00:40:23,605
which ties in with knowing yourself and being willing to be vulnerable.

456
00:40:26,806 --> 00:40:29,787
Now I know this is scary because I've been there.

457
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,369
Being vulnerable means being open to critique.

458
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:38,411
But being vulnerable is a very key part of someone knowing who you are.

459
00:40:39,331 --> 00:40:42,032
At the end of the day, people hire people.

460
00:40:43,933 --> 00:40:45,494
People will hire you for who you are.

461
00:40:47,188 --> 00:40:53,611
At a recent posting we put out for a social media manager, part-time role, new studio,

462
00:41:08,203 --> 00:41:08,643
20 hours a week.

463
00:41:09,523 --> 00:41:11,004
Not as much pay as I would have loved to have given.

464
00:41:11,684 --> 00:41:15,365
We got over 400 applications in the first week.

465
00:41:16,586 --> 00:41:22,448
We only were able to interview six, and the six that we picked were the ones that were the most authentic in themselves.

466
00:41:23,128 --> 00:41:24,568
Not just the people who had great skills.

467
00:41:25,188 --> 00:41:25,769
They all did.

468
00:41:26,889 --> 00:41:30,030
The people who told me about their passion with the Neopets community.

469
00:41:31,637 --> 00:41:35,519
or about a Hindu mythology comic series they want to write in the future.

470
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:42,303
For a community marketing position, that was what got me convinced those are the people I want to interview.

471
00:41:44,024 --> 00:41:51,669
It helps you stand out, not like one of the hundreds of others, which is why being authentic really matters.

472
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:57,993
Be authentic not to get hired, but be genuine to get hired in the place that's right for you.

473
00:41:59,814 --> 00:42:00,094
Thank you.

474
00:42:16,097 --> 00:42:23,061
I want to pause with this thank you slide because I think it's really important, and I appreciate you including all the people who have supported you, Trento.

475
00:42:28,904 --> 00:42:38,350
So I know we have some career changers in the room, and it is a great honor to invite our last speaker for hope and honest sharings.

476
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:41,932
So I think there's no better way to end GDC24 with Lara.

477
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,922
Wow, y'all are just wonderful.

478
00:42:55,362 --> 00:42:57,604
Thanks for being here.

479
00:42:57,624 --> 00:42:59,286
Okay.

480
00:42:59,546 --> 00:43:00,927
Hi, I'm Laura.

481
00:43:01,768 --> 00:43:04,451
I have had four careers before landing in games.

482
00:43:05,051 --> 00:43:07,394
My kittens are named Nocturne and Fiddlesticks.

483
00:43:07,934 --> 00:43:10,697
I had no idea they were league names before I chose them.

484
00:43:12,278 --> 00:43:12,799
I craft.

485
00:43:13,099 --> 00:43:13,720
I play games.

486
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,401
I have ADHD.

487
00:43:16,322 --> 00:43:18,124
I have anxiety.

488
00:43:18,608 --> 00:43:21,670
I sometimes suffer from imposter syndrome.

489
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:24,192
And I'm a development coordinator on Fortnite BR.

490
00:43:25,753 --> 00:43:33,559
As a dreamer who once wrote a list of 63 careers that I thought might make me happy, I've always hated the question, what do you want to be when you grow up?

491
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,083
How could I possibly limit myself to just one option?

492
00:43:38,903 --> 00:43:43,667
When I said I didn't know, people always responded with some version of, oh, that's OK.

493
00:43:43,807 --> 00:43:44,848
You'll figure it out one day.

494
00:43:45,368 --> 00:43:47,750
What they didn't say is, it's OK to change your mind.

495
00:43:48,977 --> 00:43:53,059
During a coveted acting mentorship in college, I went through a bout of depression.

496
00:43:53,939 --> 00:43:54,619
I knew I was good.

497
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:55,980
I knew I could do it.

498
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:57,941
But could I actually?

499
00:43:58,441 --> 00:43:59,602
Was it a mistake to be there?

500
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:07,485
When I finally got the courage to talk to my mentor about this, their response, unfortunately, completely drained my morale.

501
00:44:08,185 --> 00:44:13,027
They said, if you think you can be somewhere else and do it, you probably should.

502
00:44:13,468 --> 00:44:16,769
There's a whole bunch of people who want to be here and can't imagine doing anything else.

503
00:44:18,035 --> 00:44:18,976
completely destroyed me.

504
00:44:19,777 --> 00:44:25,103
I actually left a career that I loved a lot because I took that word as the only option.

505
00:44:27,025 --> 00:44:29,707
In hindsight, the path wasn't actually the problem.

506
00:44:30,188 --> 00:44:31,970
The problem was the group of people I was with.

507
00:44:32,771 --> 00:44:38,457
Honestly, my career would probably look very different today if I had been with a different company or asked a second opinion.

508
00:44:39,267 --> 00:44:41,987
It took me years to feel comfortable to ask that question again.

509
00:44:42,468 --> 00:44:47,128
And when I did, the answer was incredibly uplifting and it propelled me further in my career at Epic.

510
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:53,589
If you find yourself suffering from imposter syndrome, it's worth checking in and asking yourself these following questions.

511
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:59,851
You can answer no to any of these questions and still deserve to be where you are.

512
00:45:02,671 --> 00:45:07,972
It might be good to check if a different version of here could help you thrive.

513
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:11,671
The voices in your head can and will lie to you.

514
00:45:12,331 --> 00:45:16,453
The voices outside your head will also lie to you, even if they think they're trying to protect you.

515
00:45:17,814 --> 00:45:19,935
I did want to take time to make a special call out.

516
00:45:21,515 --> 00:45:31,920
While everyone deserves their place to be here, and really, everyone does, marginalized groups tend to suffer from imposter syndrome more than groups that are already well represented in this industry.

517
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:35,074
So, this one's for you.

518
00:45:35,776 --> 00:45:36,799
You deserve to be here.

519
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:40,968
And for everyone else, how are you making your here the right space to be?

520
00:45:42,947 --> 00:45:46,069
Down the line at a job shadow, I was very excited about.

521
00:45:46,649 --> 00:45:53,173
I was talking to a person about how I loved two separate disciplines at that company, and I inquired if I could switch one day.

522
00:45:54,373 --> 00:45:56,194
I was very passionate about both.

523
00:45:56,454 --> 00:45:57,755
I had studied both in college.

524
00:45:58,375 --> 00:46:02,718
They replied, I have plenty of people who just want this track, and they worked really hard.

525
00:46:03,098 --> 00:46:05,779
If you want to be somewhere else, why would I hire you?

526
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,000
It's not fair to them.

527
00:46:08,701 --> 00:46:12,083
I feel like I worked really hard too, but I took that as a rule of success.

528
00:46:13,652 --> 00:46:14,753
Again, second mistake.

529
00:46:15,514 --> 00:46:16,795
I stopped being curious then.

530
00:46:17,335 --> 00:46:23,300
I pretended like my dreams didn't exist, and I burnt out really, really hard.

531
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:28,704
Pigeonholing myself caused so much heartache, and I lost years of growth.

532
00:46:29,124 --> 00:46:35,890
I shied away from opportunities, and I know that there are companies out there that lost out on an incredibly passionate and driven employee.

533
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:39,953
After over a decade of that, something finally had to give.

534
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:52,265
Echoing some of Trento's points, it is more than okay to ask vulnerable questions, but take care to recognize the answers you've given are just a data point, they are not the entire story.

535
00:46:53,306 --> 00:46:58,831
No one gets to tell you what your path is, only you get to decide what the right one feels like.

536
00:46:59,452 --> 00:47:04,757
I absolutely love my current career, but I don't think the journey getting there needed to be so painful.

537
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:14,054
My first GDC in 2022, I didn't fully engage with anyone because I was worried I would say something stupid and get blacklisted before I got in.

538
00:47:15,054 --> 00:47:19,937
I went to a wiki event and met the dream person and my dream career at my dream studio.

539
00:47:20,417 --> 00:47:23,158
And the only thing I remember saying is, that's cool.

540
00:47:23,639 --> 00:47:23,879
Thanks.

541
00:47:24,899 --> 00:47:25,660
So take my advice.

542
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:35,645
It will always be easier to interact with people, not with job titles, not with, uh, not with job titles, not with their job, not with their title.

543
00:47:37,194 --> 00:47:40,756
You may think that they're the rock stars of this industry, but they are also just people.

544
00:47:41,796 --> 00:47:45,998
The memories that will stick are the moments that you have a chance to genuinely connect with each other.

545
00:47:47,879 --> 00:47:50,220
Compliment a patch that someone has on their bag.

546
00:47:50,981 --> 00:47:52,381
Compliment someone's gaming tee.

547
00:47:53,022 --> 00:47:55,523
Talk about a talk that you noticed you both were in.

548
00:47:56,964 --> 00:48:05,648
I've had hundreds of conversations since that GDC three years ago, but the ones I remember are the ones where we actually stopped and took a minute to see each other and connect.

549
00:48:07,066 --> 00:48:12,329
It can be easy to feel like you're losing your identity when you get pushed out of a career or doubt your choices.

550
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:14,170
You are not one thing.

551
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:15,791
You are not your job.

552
00:48:16,212 --> 00:48:17,012
You are not your title.

553
00:48:17,432 --> 00:48:18,753
You aren't even this industry.

554
00:48:19,254 --> 00:48:19,714
You are you.

555
00:48:20,174 --> 00:48:27,759
You are made up of hundreds of likes and dislikes and interests and hobbies and opinions, just like every other person in this room.

556
00:48:28,459 --> 00:48:30,801
That's the stuff that will make a lasting impression.

557
00:48:31,421 --> 00:48:36,084
You can lose your job, you can get pushed out of a career, or you can change your mind and you can still be you.

558
00:48:36,978 --> 00:48:42,543
On my intro slide, you'll note that my title was just one of the things on there, and it wasn't even the one that I value the most.

559
00:48:43,404 --> 00:48:45,726
Lastly, I'm going to leave you with my favorite piece of advice.

560
00:48:46,187 --> 00:48:48,709
If you remember nothing else, I hope you remember this.

561
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:50,651
Care, 10% less.

562
00:48:53,092 --> 00:48:58,396
10% less is still an A. No one will notice that you were caring less except for you.

563
00:48:59,117 --> 00:49:09,304
And the only thing that you'll notice is more energy, less stress, and more sustainable actions that will lead to a better you and a better industry.

564
00:49:10,305 --> 00:49:15,169
So take it from someone who jumped from theater to barista to bookseller into games.

565
00:49:15,789 --> 00:49:18,031
It is OK to follow winding paths.

566
00:49:18,571 --> 00:49:20,793
It's OK to change your mind.

567
00:49:21,093 --> 00:49:22,334
It's OK to try and fail.

568
00:49:23,912 --> 00:49:26,753
It's okay to ask questions and be curious about your options.

569
00:49:27,513 --> 00:49:30,754
It's okay to ignore advice that doesn't work for you.

570
00:49:32,715 --> 00:49:35,015
I promise you will still be hireable.

571
00:49:35,636 --> 00:49:37,736
I promise you'll be hireable if you pivot again.

572
00:49:38,837 --> 00:49:43,678
I actually think that my job, I'm better at it because of my varied experience.

573
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:47,639
And I've heard that from more than just myself.

574
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,180
I've heard it from so many people.

575
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:55,533
It's not always easy, and some might scoff at your path, but it is always going to be worth it.

576
00:49:55,993 --> 00:50:02,036
And as long as you're approaching things with a sense of curiosity, passion, and authenticity, you're going to be just fine.

577
00:50:02,937 --> 00:50:03,297
Thank you.

578
00:50:19,653 --> 00:50:21,694
I saw lots of heads nodding.

579
00:50:22,035 --> 00:50:22,335
Yeah.

580
00:50:22,975 --> 00:50:26,177
And I will try that care 10% less.

581
00:50:26,237 --> 00:50:27,258
I love that advice.

582
00:50:27,778 --> 00:50:33,241
And I really appreciate you establishing that we belong.

583
00:50:34,202 --> 00:50:39,625
And now we will open up to some questions.

584
00:50:39,725 --> 00:50:41,686
We won't have time for every question.

585
00:50:42,923 --> 00:50:48,055
here, but we will stay around and we'll be able to answer after we have to get off the mic.

586
00:50:49,017 --> 00:50:52,465
But we do have some microphones over there if you're welcome to...

587
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:58,274
And we'll alternate places, and we'll take the first question.

588
00:51:00,096 --> 00:51:00,177
Hi.

589
00:51:00,237 --> 00:51:01,378
Thank you so much for being here.

590
00:51:01,518 --> 00:51:09,607
It's really great to see all these insights into the industry that we just really don't get in a professional level.

591
00:51:09,968 --> 00:51:13,452
You kind of just want to be your best self, but sometimes that's just

592
00:51:14,873 --> 00:51:15,594
Not the best approach.

593
00:51:16,535 --> 00:51:18,157
So this one goes to Fossey.

594
00:51:19,418 --> 00:51:20,559
I really enjoyed your talk.

595
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:23,161
And so you say you want to build a skill.

596
00:51:23,862 --> 00:51:26,545
And you also mentioned that time is limited.

597
00:51:26,605 --> 00:51:29,407
There are just only so many hours in the day.

598
00:51:31,289 --> 00:51:39,112
You have a day job or you're a student and then you arrive home late in the afternoon, you're really tired.

599
00:51:39,232 --> 00:51:46,354
How do you keep cultivating the skill set that you need in a kind of limited time or limited schedule?

600
00:51:48,955 --> 00:51:53,396
So the question is, you have limited time, how can you cultivate these skills?

601
00:51:53,716 --> 00:51:54,717
Did I capture that correctly?

602
00:51:55,157 --> 00:51:55,357
Yes.

603
00:51:55,457 --> 00:51:57,037
Fawzi, you can start and then we'll open it up.

604
00:51:58,038 --> 00:51:58,378
Wonderful.

605
00:51:58,888 --> 00:51:59,649
Thank you for your question.

606
00:51:59,669 --> 00:52:05,033
So I think like the way I approach it, I think I go a little bit almost literal to the topic.

607
00:52:05,533 --> 00:52:11,437
How much time do I have and how much time will it take for me to acquire that skill?

608
00:52:11,517 --> 00:52:14,540
So I try to actually literally get the number of hours.

609
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,863
I do a time audit regularly for myself, which is a weird thing to do, I admit.

610
00:52:20,243 --> 00:52:24,786
and I see how much time I have a week that is available for me for growth.

611
00:52:25,746 --> 00:52:35,192
And I will, you know, whether it's an hour, half an hour, 20 minutes, five minutes, you know, how much time can I allocate a week for growth?

612
00:52:36,112 --> 00:52:40,994
And for the skill set, how much time would it require me to learn it?

613
00:52:41,354 --> 00:52:45,216
And it's amazing how you can like actually find a lot of quantifiable information to this topic.

614
00:52:45,396 --> 00:52:51,438
For example, I was learning Japanese and discovered that you need 550 hours to be adequate at Japanese.

615
00:52:52,199 --> 00:52:55,000
When I looked at I have 2000 hours in Dota 2, I was like,

616
00:52:56,494 --> 00:52:57,435
I could probably do that.

617
00:52:59,076 --> 00:53:03,859
And Angel, I saw you leaning and I was just curious if you wanted to jump in there or... Okay.

618
00:53:04,039 --> 00:53:05,260
No, I'm just listening.

619
00:53:08,262 --> 00:53:09,843
Anyone else want to jump in on that question?

620
00:53:12,725 --> 00:53:13,045
Okay.

621
00:53:13,425 --> 00:53:14,326
Thank you for that question.

622
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:15,086
Thank you so much.

623
00:53:15,186 --> 00:53:16,327
My pleasure.

624
00:53:16,447 --> 00:53:16,988
Thank you, Fazi.

625
00:53:17,868 --> 00:53:18,108
Hello.

626
00:53:18,629 --> 00:53:20,270
So my question was,

627
00:53:22,085 --> 00:53:25,208
Okay, so two years post-grad, no job prospects yet.

628
00:53:25,688 --> 00:53:32,073
What advice, could you touch on it a little bit, what advice would you overall have to say like, hey, don't give up yet.

629
00:53:33,695 --> 00:53:35,556
Like, how do you keep that momentum going?

630
00:53:36,037 --> 00:53:39,099
So the job search taking a long time, how do we keep going?

631
00:53:42,442 --> 00:53:45,244
We'll do Adinda, then Trento.

632
00:53:46,658 --> 00:53:50,620
So for me, I always wanted to find out what I really want.

633
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:54,022
And then I'm going to really check what should I do.

634
00:53:54,362 --> 00:53:59,885
Like, for example, the Hong Kong job, I should have been a learning service tutor.

635
00:54:00,405 --> 00:54:01,546
I had no clue what it was.

636
00:54:02,026 --> 00:54:03,067
I just searched on Google.

637
00:54:03,587 --> 00:54:06,829
Oh, OK, I guess this and this has connection with it.

638
00:54:07,289 --> 00:54:09,430
So that was the way how I approach it.

639
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:12,272
I really search what do I want, what do I need.

640
00:54:12,792 --> 00:54:14,473
And that's the way I look at it.

641
00:54:17,653 --> 00:54:19,981
This is not actionable in the... Oh, this will get you the job.

642
00:54:22,805 --> 00:54:25,567
I did audio in the past, I should know how to do that.

643
00:54:26,187 --> 00:54:29,490
It's not actionable in the, this will get you the job, but it will hopefully help you feel better.

644
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:38,416
And that's find community, find a friend, find hopefully multiple people who are in the same position as you and find camaraderie.

645
00:54:38,476 --> 00:54:39,857
And the, we're all looking for this together.

646
00:54:40,257 --> 00:54:42,179
They'll also be able to help you develop your own skills.

647
00:54:42,259 --> 00:54:46,782
Maybe you can make a game jam, do projects together, do something small and continue to develop your skills.

648
00:54:47,062 --> 00:54:47,903
Like was mentioned before.

649
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:51,811
on

650
00:55:02,783 --> 00:55:15,670
list everything that you're doing and your varying levels of success and then start changing the patterns of each thing and how you approach it and see what kind of result you get as you start to change things.

651
00:55:16,791 --> 00:55:24,075
If you continue to do the same things and approach things the same way and get the same results, then you need to change your approach.

652
00:55:24,695 --> 00:55:28,177
And if you change too much, you won't actually know what led to the success.

653
00:55:28,418 --> 00:55:32,600
But if you start changing one thing at a time, you can actually see the difference that it'll make.

654
00:55:33,401 --> 00:55:36,063
And then you can start tweaking the other things that aren't working.

655
00:55:41,426 --> 00:55:44,428
To repeat the comment, what are you, a designer?

656
00:55:45,929 --> 00:55:47,170
And then we have another question over here.

657
00:55:48,629 --> 00:55:48,969
Hi.

658
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:51,890
I'm a high school student.

659
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:53,391
I'm a junior in high school right now.

660
00:55:55,691 --> 00:55:57,572
I live in Colorado.

661
00:55:58,352 --> 00:56:01,573
This is my first time at GDC.

662
00:56:02,273 --> 00:56:04,354
Probably won't be here for another few years.

663
00:56:05,674 --> 00:56:10,396
I don't get to do things like this very often, so networking for me is difficult.

664
00:56:11,816 --> 00:56:13,297
First of all, way to take the step to come here.

665
00:56:13,317 --> 00:56:13,857
That's incredible.

666
00:56:47,326 --> 00:56:53,709
So the question is, how do we network online when we cannot be in these spaces?

667
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:56,351
So I thought I saw someone lean in over here.

668
00:56:58,323 --> 00:57:05,387
I'm going to give you one for just like a year down the line.

669
00:57:05,888 --> 00:57:08,169
You see all these lovely humans in the pink shirts?

670
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:12,352
They are a part of something called the Conference Associate Program.

671
00:57:12,813 --> 00:57:14,334
And it is how I got my job.

672
00:57:15,795 --> 00:57:22,259
It is a wonderful community that I definitely couldn't have done this without.

673
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:25,582
So applications normally open up in October.

674
00:57:26,522 --> 00:57:31,827
and you decide or you get picked if you are lucky in December.

675
00:57:32,808 --> 00:57:37,111
And yeah, it is one of the greatest networking opportunities of a lifetime.

676
00:57:37,612 --> 00:57:38,192
Highly recommend.

677
00:57:39,433 --> 00:57:39,733
Angela.

678
00:57:41,204 --> 00:57:44,346
So online spaces, there are resources.

679
00:57:44,886 --> 00:57:52,389
I'm worried about you because you're in high school, so I'm going to focus on other things, like local, especially like, you said Colorado, right?

680
00:57:52,629 --> 00:57:53,709
Yeah, yeah, Colorado.

681
00:57:53,809 --> 00:57:55,890
There's probably schools around you or something.

682
00:57:55,970 --> 00:58:00,812
I find that reaching out to people, especially professors or something, they're really receptive.

683
00:58:00,872 --> 00:58:03,453
If you want to learn, they want to help you learn.

684
00:58:04,133 --> 00:58:10,376
If you can find also if there are other professionals in your area, they want to help you if you want to reach out.

685
00:58:11,037 --> 00:58:12,798
Yes, I do know a few.

686
00:58:12,878 --> 00:58:15,420
There's a few game developers in Denver.

687
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:19,982
I mean, I do go to a game development program.

688
00:58:20,042 --> 00:58:21,463
I talked to my teacher about it.

689
00:58:22,864 --> 00:58:29,608
But it's just, I know, you know, I don't just want to walk up to Serenity and Forge and be like, hey, are you guys doing internships?

690
00:58:29,688 --> 00:58:32,309
Or like, come, like, can I talk to you?

691
00:58:32,569 --> 00:58:34,971
I feel like that's kind of difficult.

692
00:58:35,626 --> 00:58:41,190
Why not be a little brave and just email them and be like, hey, does anyone have a couple minutes to talk?

693
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:42,351
I'm super interested.

694
00:58:42,391 --> 00:58:43,791
I just have a couple questions.

695
00:58:44,012 --> 00:58:45,232
Prepare a couple questions.

696
00:58:45,553 --> 00:58:46,693
Do you have 15 minutes?

697
00:58:47,234 --> 00:58:48,555
And just leave it at that.

698
00:58:48,895 --> 00:58:51,817
If it's super low stakes, keep it low stakes for yourself.

699
00:58:52,257 --> 00:58:53,378
Keep it low stakes for them.

700
00:58:53,578 --> 00:58:55,359
Everybody has 15 minutes here and there.

701
00:58:55,659 --> 00:58:56,180
You know what I mean?

702
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:59,602
And if all it takes is to respond to an email to you, maybe they'll do it.

703
00:59:00,523 --> 00:59:02,504
And Trento, final thoughts on that question?

704
00:59:03,782 --> 00:59:08,307
I think, Angela, you mentioned earlier that networking is about making friends, asking honest, genuine questions.

705
00:59:08,908 --> 00:59:13,093
And if you don't go into it with an agenda of, I want a job, and just, hey, I'm a student.

706
00:59:13,193 --> 00:59:14,494
I'd really like to learn more about this.

707
00:59:14,955 --> 00:59:15,956
Can I ask you some questions?

708
00:59:17,118 --> 00:59:19,801
I think 99% of developers would be more than happy to make the time for that.

709
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:21,420
Okay, perfect.

710
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,141
Thank you so much.

711
00:59:22,401 --> 00:59:24,202
So thank you everyone for coming.

712
00:59:24,462 --> 00:59:25,622
We will stick around.

713
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:31,625
I know there's another question for... You probably all have questions, so we will stay around and answer questions.

714
00:59:32,605 --> 00:59:35,227
For the conference associates, do we need to leave the room?

715
00:59:35,707 --> 00:59:36,227
Is that correct?

716
00:59:36,427 --> 00:59:40,069
This is like the last talk in this room for the day.

717
00:59:40,089 --> 00:59:43,990
They will be closing the building soon, because they're ending early today.

718
00:59:44,411 --> 00:59:46,752
So, you know, if you could clear the room.

719
00:59:46,772 --> 00:59:47,312
Basically, yes.

720
00:59:47,993 --> 00:59:51,740
Yes, so that the answer is yes, so we will meet you in the hallway
