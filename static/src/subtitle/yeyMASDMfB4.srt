1
00:00:07,932 --> 00:00:14,057
Let's start with this conference, how we almost wrecked our second game aptly named The Wreck.

2
00:00:16,759 --> 00:00:18,200
If my keyboard works, of course.

3
00:00:20,262 --> 00:00:29,169
So I put the same t-shirt I had in 2018, so you can play the 25 million differences game, you know, between me then and me now.

4
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,471
My name is Florent Morin.

5
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:32,512
I'm from France.

6
00:00:32,552 --> 00:00:34,934
I try to work on my accent, but it's not working.

7
00:00:36,055 --> 00:00:37,035
I'm a former journalist.

8
00:00:38,396 --> 00:00:43,217
I've created The Pixel Hunt, our tiny video game studio, in 2013, I think.

9
00:00:44,617 --> 00:00:51,699
And in this studio, I'm a writer, game designer, producer, creative director, and I wear way too many hats.

10
00:00:51,899 --> 00:01:05,102
We did a first game in 2017 that was called Bury Me, My Love, and as every game we do, it's a reality-inspired game, a game that tries to talk about real topics of the real life.

11
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:09,244
And today I'm here to tell you a little bit, a little story.

12
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:12,845
This story starts, I forgot to start my timer.

13
00:01:14,346 --> 00:01:22,369
This story starts, oh, and I forgot to specify that I'm very bad at PowerPoint, so I'm sorry for the quality of the slides that are coming, yeah.

14
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:23,450
Bear with me.

15
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:31,353
The introduction of this story is, once upon a time, a tiny video game studio in France made a game called Bury Your Love.

16
00:01:31,394 --> 00:01:34,055
So you may have not played it, but

17
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:39,143
By indie standards, it's been a huge success for us.

18
00:01:39,343 --> 00:01:42,587
It sold over 100,000 copies over five years.

19
00:01:43,268 --> 00:01:52,457
And when it was out, it got very, very positive feedback, both from the press, the players, of course, and also it got awards.

20
00:01:52,497 --> 00:01:56,441
Actually, we were nominated here at GDC in 2018 for Best Mobile Game.

21
00:01:57,122 --> 00:02:06,115
So yeah, it was really humbling, but it was also really great for us because we got the feeling that we were living a fairy tale, basically.

22
00:02:06,804 --> 00:02:10,605
And so that's the first chapter of the story, the fairy tale.

23
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:13,186
We had a very successful game.

24
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:17,447
We had lots of desires to work on new games.

25
00:02:17,547 --> 00:02:23,628
So the question that started appearing in our minds was, no what?

26
00:02:24,148 --> 00:02:27,029
Well, the answer for us at the time seemed very simple.

27
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:30,570
No, let's use what we've learned to make another game.

28
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,791
Only, of course, when you have a first game that's successful,

29
00:02:34,491 --> 00:02:40,559
Then you tend to grow ambitions, so let's do it bigger and better, of course.

30
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:41,740
That's easy, right?

31
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:49,249
We've done it right the first time, we will just do all the same things all over again and make it even better the second time.

32
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:52,194
But what had we learned in the process?

33
00:02:52,574 --> 00:02:55,338
First, we know how to make a game.

34
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,705
So I'm not saying that the path to releasing Burying Your Love was a walk in the park.

35
00:03:00,946 --> 00:03:06,393
Of course, there were problems, and of course, because game development is game development, there were issues.

36
00:03:07,034 --> 00:03:14,498
But we shipped on time, and we also shipped on budget, and we shipped bug-free, although that last point is debatable.

37
00:03:14,698 --> 00:03:21,643
But I would argue that most players were very satisfied with the game, so we were very satisfied.

38
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:29,007
And my belief at the time was that it's not that hard, really, to make video games.

39
00:03:30,187 --> 00:03:33,710
Sweet, sweet summer child, yeah.

40
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,831
And then, just before releasing,

41
00:03:37,496 --> 00:03:40,480
Bury My Love, I got in a car accident.

42
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,145
It was a pretty bad crash but luckily enough we weren't hurt.

43
00:03:45,707 --> 00:03:46,668
Nobody had anything.

44
00:03:47,369 --> 00:03:50,533
But it gave me an idea for a new game.

45
00:03:50,653 --> 00:03:53,617
When you're a game designer, I think everything gives you ideas for new games.

46
00:03:54,338 --> 00:03:57,360
But this one was interesting, at least to me.

47
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:09,389
I thought that making a game about being in a car accident and seeing your life flash before your eyes and remembering things from the past was actually an idea that was interesting.

48
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:14,193
Actually, it made me think of an old French movie called The Things of Life that does exactly that.

49
00:04:14,873 --> 00:04:35,789
But in the form of a game, I had never seen something like that, so I thought it's a good fit for us because it's reality-inspired, it's not seen before, and my idea was to tell an intimate story and something quite intense about a character whose life would be turned literally upside down by what was happening to them in this car accident.

50
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:42,194
I was pretty convinced that it had to be a very good idea and a very easy one to implement.

51
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,838
As I said, sweet summer child.

52
00:04:46,118 --> 00:04:56,903
The cool thing about being European, and that might be a little bit odd for people living in North America and pretty much all the rest of the world, is that we've got something pretty cool called public funding.

53
00:04:57,904 --> 00:05:00,245
In Europe, it's actually really cool.

54
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:10,548
In Europe, you can apply to, for instance, a European Creative Media Europe prototype fund, and you can get some money to start working on your game.

55
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:18,331
That's what we did with the first draft of what The Wreck, so our next game is called The Wreck, would be.

56
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,212
And we got 50,000 euros to begin with.

57
00:05:21,412 --> 00:05:26,914
The only rule when you have public funding is that you have to match that amount with private funds.

58
00:05:27,754 --> 00:05:44,585
So we found ourselves with a budget of 100,000 euros to spend and I thought I was smart and I thought we could just make a vertical slice directly rather than work on a proof of concept prototype because 100,000 euros is a lot of money.

59
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:58,506
So I thought we were just going to get ahead of ourselves and directly start working on something that would both work as a prototype to show what we wanted to do as a game and also basically be the first part of that game.

60
00:06:00,305 --> 00:06:05,772
We also knew how to build a team, so that's exactly what I started doing for the second project.

61
00:06:07,114 --> 00:06:12,261
We hired excellent writers, Olivia Wood and George Lockett from the UK.

62
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:16,666
They are very talented and so I asked them to join us in this adventure.

63
00:06:17,765 --> 00:06:30,555
We hired an art director who is very experienced, Alexandre Grieta, because I knew that he would be able to develop a visual universe that would be striking and interesting.

64
00:06:31,356 --> 00:06:33,017
And then I got a little carried away.

65
00:06:33,318 --> 00:06:41,664
We hired a dev, sound guys, another dev, a voiceover director, Sarah Elmaleh, who did an absolutely stellar job on the game.

66
00:06:42,245 --> 00:06:46,608
And basically, we were pretty quickly a full-fledged team.

67
00:06:47,794 --> 00:06:50,896
And so I was thinking that the project was shaping up.

68
00:06:50,996 --> 00:06:53,697
I was really happy with the way things were turning.

69
00:06:54,498 --> 00:07:00,701
And I was also very in love with every single member in my team, very in awe with all their talents.

70
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:07,365
So I led myself into thinking that such a talented team could not fail, of course.

71
00:07:08,647 --> 00:07:13,713
And we also learned along the way with Barry Malove, we learned how to convince partners.

72
00:07:14,053 --> 00:07:23,483
So Barry Malove was actually a co-production, so we learned how to just negotiate with people and convince them to invest in our projects.

73
00:07:23,784 --> 00:07:30,030
And that's when we met Alexis Garavarian, who is the head of Column Knights.

74
00:07:30,731 --> 00:07:37,535
Columnites, for those who don't know them, are an investment fund that they invest in projects, not in companies.

75
00:07:37,635 --> 00:07:44,339
So if they like your game, they will give you some money to actually make the game, and then they are pretty hands-off.

76
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:47,801
But as you'll see, they still are very keen on providing feedback.

77
00:07:48,721 --> 00:07:54,946
Alexei liked the project I pitched to him and also he really loved Bury My Love.

78
00:07:54,986 --> 00:07:56,747
He had played it and really enjoyed it.

79
00:07:57,407 --> 00:08:02,691
So he was really keen to see what we were going to do next with our next project.

80
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:15,341
He gathered with his board and together they decided that they will fund our game, but as we didn't have a prototype yet, they would only give us that much money so that we can actually make a prototype.

81
00:08:15,521 --> 00:08:23,147
And then we would have a review after that pre-production phase so that they could evaluate the direction we were headed.

82
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:35,297
And that's when the fairy tale turned into something of a cautionary tale because, of course, Conan Knights are very experienced and, of course, they had concerns.

83
00:08:35,657 --> 00:08:41,638
First, the new project, The Wreck, seemed quite far from Bury Me, My Love.

84
00:08:42,319 --> 00:08:48,600
Bury Me, My Love is in 2D, it's text-based, it's basically a glorified choose-your-own-adventure book.

85
00:08:50,001 --> 00:08:55,008
and the wreck was in 3D, it implied lots of gameplay, more gameplay mechanics.

86
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:58,433
So it was really different from the first project.

87
00:08:58,453 --> 00:09:04,641
So of course, they warned us, they told us that there were challenges to overcome with this new project.

88
00:09:05,726 --> 00:09:13,394
And also, they were slightly worried that that might be a little harder to tell a compelling story that way.

89
00:09:13,514 --> 00:09:20,020
Because what they loved about Burmy, my love, is the storytelling of the game.

90
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:29,910
And of course, if you do a game that's more like a game, a little bit less like a story, it may be more complicated to tell the story in a very compelling way.

91
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,813
But even though they had all those warnings, they trusted us.

92
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:39,377
So they decided to give us a green light and we started working.

93
00:09:40,578 --> 00:09:45,501
So we worked for roughly nine months, almost a year actually.

94
00:09:46,322 --> 00:09:49,444
And the result was a 30 minutes vertical slice.

95
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:54,989
So something that would look not like a prototype, but like something that we could actually use in

96
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:56,469
the final game.

97
00:09:56,969 --> 00:09:57,990
And that's how it worked.

98
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,910
You had a central crash scene.

99
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,852
So you would begin the game driving a car, and very quickly you would get into an accident.

100
00:10:05,312 --> 00:10:19,696
And then the time would slow down, so the crash would happen very slowly, and the main character's bag would open up, and objects would start flying around, as you can see in the last pictures done right.

101
00:10:20,556 --> 00:10:26,741
And you would use those items to access some of the character's memories.

102
00:10:27,441 --> 00:10:39,751
So you would point at the objects and it would just like spark new memories in the character's mind and then suddenly you would be teletransported to the actual memories.

103
00:10:40,011 --> 00:10:44,974
And we had three memories to explore in this version of the prototype.

104
00:10:45,575 --> 00:10:49,578
And each memory came with a custom puzzle minigame.

105
00:10:49,838 --> 00:10:57,730
So three different memories, three different mini-games to play with and to understand the rest of the story.

106
00:10:58,678 --> 00:11:01,439
And we had an idea that we thought was a very good one at the time.

107
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:03,199
Spoiler, not so much.

108
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:07,720
We decided to go with two very different visual styles.

109
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:20,082
So what we wanted to have is to have a style in the car crash that was very realistic, because it was in the present, and we wanted it to feel like it's happening right now, right before your eyes.

110
00:11:20,182 --> 00:11:24,323
So we tried to go with something that would look really realistic.

111
00:11:25,043 --> 00:11:43,726
But then when you would access memories, the memories were VR painted because we thought that the brush strokes that you can actually see in VR painted models would convey the sense of weirdness and this dreamlike feeling that you have when you think about memories, basically.

112
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:52,208
So we thought that it was a really good idea to have this difference between those two styles and to be able to alternate between one and the other.

113
00:11:52,528 --> 00:11:52,988
Basically,

114
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,422
everything is perfect.

115
00:11:58,404 --> 00:11:59,305
Or maybe it's not.

116
00:12:00,606 --> 00:12:05,030
And then that's when the story begins to change and evolve into a horror story.

117
00:12:05,311 --> 00:12:11,256
Because we sent our prototype to Cologne Knights and it was time for honest feedback.

118
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:12,217
First,

119
00:12:13,194 --> 00:12:15,556
They thought that the gameplay was clunky.

120
00:12:16,677 --> 00:12:23,003
Sometimes you didn't know what you were supposed to do, and when you did, you could have trouble doing it.

121
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:27,307
Sometimes you would try to do what you were supposed to do and not achieve that.

122
00:12:27,487 --> 00:12:28,448
So it was clunky.

123
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:36,676
You can say no big deal, that's what prototypes are for, you can still try to polish it and make it better, but that was not the only issue.

124
00:12:37,536 --> 00:12:45,924
Another issue was that the art style, the very intelligent choice that we made, was not working very well, actually.

125
00:12:46,404 --> 00:13:00,474
It was all over the place and another problem with that is it was very complicated to identify the wreck as a game because if you would put two screenshots of the same game next to each other, they would look nothing alike.

126
00:13:00,675 --> 00:13:07,359
So it would be complicated to just communicate on the game and to just show this is what the wreck looks like because it doesn't look like one thing.

127
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,320
that didn't work very well.

128
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:14,962
And the third problem is that the writing was good, but not memorable.

129
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,523
Actually, the writing was really excellent.

130
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:22,165
Olivia and George did an awesome job writing the first draft of the prototype.

131
00:13:22,865 --> 00:13:36,970
But the problem was that because you were troubled by the different art style, and because you had that gameplay that got in the way of really immersing yourself in the story, you wouldn't really

132
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:45,181
get the full intention of the story and you would not really feel engrossed by it.

133
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:53,273
So for a company that's supposed to make story-heavy games with stories that are really memorable, that really didn't work.

134
00:13:54,724 --> 00:14:01,750
The fourth point that they gave us as a point of feedback was that the game felt experimental.

135
00:14:01,911 --> 00:14:03,812
So at least that's good, right?

136
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:05,994
It's amazing to be experimental.

137
00:14:06,115 --> 00:14:10,418
Some very cool IGF-nominated games are super experimental.

138
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:12,080
You can be proud of that.

139
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:18,326
But if you look at the full quote by Alexis Garavagnon, that's the rest of the quotes.

140
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:23,294
So, yeah, it was experimental, but not in a good way.

141
00:14:23,414 --> 00:14:33,360
It felt like, he told me afterwards, because he didn't want to be too cruel at first, but he told me that it felt a little bit like a student project, but not a very masterful one.

142
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,961
So, you know, yeah.

143
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:35,781
Ouch.

144
00:14:37,322 --> 00:14:45,887
So, we got this feedback, and I reacted in the only reasonable way you can react when you get such feedback.

145
00:14:46,948 --> 00:14:47,348
Denial.

146
00:14:49,815 --> 00:14:51,216
I decided that they must be wrong.

147
00:14:51,256 --> 00:14:58,040
I was really sure that they didn't understand, they didn't get what we tried to achieve and so on and so forth.

148
00:14:58,921 --> 00:15:06,486
And then I got back home and I started to work a little bit on that and to think a little bit about what makes good feedback.

149
00:15:07,714 --> 00:15:12,580
And I came to the conclusion that good feedback has to first be kind and trustful.

150
00:15:13,241 --> 00:15:23,173
People who give you feedback should always do that because they trust you and they have trust in your ability to actually use that feedback to make your game better.

151
00:15:23,934 --> 00:15:34,884
And that was definitely the case with Cologne Knights because they really loved our first game and they really believed in our ability to make something great for our second title.

152
00:15:35,544 --> 00:15:40,108
So yes, the Cologne Knights feedback ticked that first box.

153
00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:42,390
It was kind and trustful.

154
00:15:43,431 --> 00:15:45,832
It has to come from people who are experienced.

155
00:15:45,892 --> 00:15:47,713
So that's not a golden rule, of course.

156
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:53,896
When you do playtests with the players, they are not necessarily super experienced in game making.

157
00:15:54,436 --> 00:16:00,519
But when you gather feedback from people such as Alexey, who used to be the head of ID at Xbox,

158
00:16:01,179 --> 00:16:21,142
and who has probably tested thousands of games, or Lindsey Rostal, who is the head of Timberline Games and who is part of the board at Cologne, part of the committee at Cologne, and all those other very experienced games people, you can't just overlook that feedback, and you have to pay attention to it.

159
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:25,077
It has to be specific and actionable.

160
00:16:25,537 --> 00:16:36,701
It has to not be too personal, like you can't give feedback such as, I don't like it, it's not my test, I don't know why but it's not working for me.

161
00:16:37,301 --> 00:16:44,304
Feedback has to be very specific and very precise in what it tells you about what's not working in your game.

162
00:16:44,884 --> 00:16:47,465
And that's exactly what Columnite did for us.

163
00:16:47,725 --> 00:16:58,329
They pointed out what didn't work specifically, and they didn't tell us how to fix it, but they told us it needed to be fixed, and that was really informative for us.

164
00:16:59,289 --> 00:17:00,790
And that's the other point, right?

165
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:07,771
Feedback, good feedback aims at bettering the game instead of redesigning it for you.

166
00:17:08,011 --> 00:17:12,772
Because when you ask feedback from game developers, they tend to put themselves in your shoes.

167
00:17:13,092 --> 00:17:15,252
I would have done things completely different.

168
00:17:15,812 --> 00:17:22,954
I invest myself and my creative process in your game, and I tell you how to completely redo it according to my views.

169
00:17:23,454 --> 00:17:25,954
This is probably not the best feedback you can get.

170
00:17:26,234 --> 00:17:29,835
The best feedback is probably the feedback that understands what you are trying to do,

171
00:17:30,575 --> 00:17:44,484
and tries to give you the best advice to make it better, especially as you consider that failure is a step towards success and not something definitive that will never be overcome.

172
00:17:44,984 --> 00:17:46,185
And that was the case.

173
00:17:46,245 --> 00:17:48,126
They told us, you know what?

174
00:17:48,306 --> 00:17:49,687
You failed with this prototype.

175
00:17:49,907 --> 00:17:52,689
We still believe that you can do something that works.

176
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:57,252
So consider that as a step towards success.

177
00:17:58,055 --> 00:18:06,857
So, yeah, I had to step out of denial, sadly, and I had to come up with a strategy to face that situation.

178
00:18:06,997 --> 00:18:14,299
So I came up with a methodology that I'm going to explain to you now, and I call it the cry method.

179
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:18,240
Yeah, really efficient.

180
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,940
So the cry method is three points.

181
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:27,282
First, consider, then refocus, and then ultimately, hopefully, yield something better.

182
00:18:31,696 --> 00:18:33,878
So consider what works.

183
00:18:34,699 --> 00:18:40,584
So we had to do some forensics for our first prototype.

184
00:18:40,764 --> 00:18:41,665
What worked in it?

185
00:18:41,785 --> 00:18:46,349
Well, the story setting and the theme were interesting, definitely.

186
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:55,276
Like we had very good feedback on that point, making a game about a car crash with a woman who has trouble in her life and tries to understand what's happening.

187
00:18:55,356 --> 00:18:56,637
This was a setting that was

188
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:04,745
not never seen before, but really interesting and really in the genre of Bury Me, My Love, so it was something that worked.

189
00:19:05,265 --> 00:19:07,667
The fragmented narrative design was promising.

190
00:19:07,828 --> 00:19:17,817
The idea that you should visit several memories as many puzzle pieces that you have to then put together to understand the full pictures, that worked too.

191
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:22,782
the memory exploration in and of itself is a cool concept.

192
00:19:23,282 --> 00:19:36,993
The idea that you can have a memory but not understand it perfectly and then move over it and work on it and finally get some kind of epiphany that something you didn't get before now you understand was a good concept and something to keep.

193
00:19:37,754 --> 00:19:44,939
The voiceover worked really well to foster immersion, even if in the first prototype, Sarah worked with very talented artists.

194
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:48,001
So that worked well, and that's definitely something we wanted to keep.

195
00:19:48,762 --> 00:19:53,965
The art style, the art styles, I should have put a plural there, were nice.

196
00:19:54,385 --> 00:19:56,247
The problem was not the art style per se.

197
00:19:56,367 --> 00:19:58,568
The problem was not Alexandre Greta's work.

198
00:19:58,608 --> 00:20:03,431
The problem was that we should be more coherent and pick one and stick with it.

199
00:20:04,392 --> 00:20:06,133
And there is a lot of personality.

200
00:20:07,113 --> 00:20:15,195
The game was unlike most games and definitely tried to explore something that is not that explored in the video game space.

201
00:20:15,856 --> 00:20:19,577
So all those things worked and we wanted to keep them.

202
00:20:20,745 --> 00:20:26,488
But then we needed to refocus on the things we are good at, as at the pixel lens.

203
00:20:26,648 --> 00:20:37,453
So definitely we're not really good puzzle games designer, especially compared to all the other very excellent puzzle game designers there are in games.

204
00:20:37,773 --> 00:20:40,974
I mean, some of the most amazing games are puzzle games.

205
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:49,018
And what we tried to do was to find, to give the player something to do in the memories, because we didn't trust in the rest of the proposition enough.

206
00:20:49,818 --> 00:20:50,719
And that didn't work.

207
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:52,961
So we decided to get rid of it.

208
00:20:53,281 --> 00:20:56,504
And we are not really good experimental game creators either.

209
00:20:57,344 --> 00:21:12,457
As much as I would like to, I must acknowledge that we are better at telling grounded stories that are just good stories than trying to really experiment with video games as a medium.

210
00:21:13,624 --> 00:21:16,748
But we're good at telling those reality-inspired stories.

211
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:27,223
We proved that with Bury My Love, also with other projects that we did before, and that's something that really we decided to focus on with the second prototype.

212
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:29,761
We're good at character-focused narration.

213
00:21:30,141 --> 00:21:39,148
Like, all of Bury My Love is only dialogues between a couple, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat for a few hours.

214
00:21:39,348 --> 00:21:44,632
So that's definitely something we need to keep exploring in our next project.

215
00:21:45,493 --> 00:21:48,715
And we also are good at making games my mother can play.

216
00:21:48,815 --> 00:21:51,697
She only played, actually, two video games.

217
00:21:52,538 --> 00:21:56,401
Sure, she's my mother, but she's also very computer illiterate.

218
00:21:57,141 --> 00:22:10,990
And that's one of the values that we wanted to carry with the Pixelant, making games that would be easily approachable by basically anyone, even people who would never define themselves as gamer.

219
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:15,733
So yes, those complicated puzzles, not a good idea.

220
00:22:15,913 --> 00:22:16,574
Let's drop that.

221
00:22:17,967 --> 00:22:20,028
So then it was time to yield something better.

222
00:22:20,808 --> 00:22:29,391
Still not a prototype because the curse of, one of the many curses of narrative games is that it's fairly complicated to prototype a narrative game.

223
00:22:29,792 --> 00:22:33,113
You can't gray box it and expect it to give the full experience.

224
00:22:34,013 --> 00:22:38,595
But we would work on something shorter, simpler, and more focused.

225
00:22:38,755 --> 00:22:46,358
It was important to just regroup on one or two main objectives that we wanted to reach with that new project.

226
00:22:48,188 --> 00:22:53,814
I would strongly advise against the CRY method, because we had less money.

227
00:22:54,374 --> 00:23:00,060
We had spent a lot of money on the first prototype, and colonnades were kind enough to give us some more, but not that much.

228
00:23:00,761 --> 00:23:02,042
So we had to scale down.

229
00:23:02,903 --> 00:23:10,030
Most of the second prototype was made with only two persons, Alexandre Grieta and myself.

230
00:23:10,911 --> 00:23:12,993
and with an all or nothing approach.

231
00:23:13,073 --> 00:23:22,499
Basically, we knew that it was our last chance to show that the project could actually exist, and that led us to very questionable work ethic.

232
00:23:22,739 --> 00:23:25,321
We had long days of work.

233
00:23:25,481 --> 00:23:40,251
We probably neglected our families in the process, and that's something I hopefully will never do again because it was really stupid, and I don't regret it because it had to be done at that point, but I really want to do everything possible to avoid that next time.

234
00:23:40,691 --> 00:23:40,759
you

235
00:23:41,414 --> 00:23:45,597
And all the more as to do that, you need an awesome partner.

236
00:23:45,937 --> 00:23:48,959
Very few Indies have a second chance.

237
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:51,721
Actually, very few Indies have a first chance.

238
00:23:52,582 --> 00:24:01,487
So it's really great to have found a partner that really believed in us and that was able to give us, extend the funds for us.

239
00:24:02,188 --> 00:24:09,253
But yeah, it's really something that I felt extremely lucky to have had and that I would advise you not to count on.

240
00:24:09,273 --> 00:24:10,954
So basically, the CRY method

241
00:24:11,515 --> 00:24:12,016
It's trash.

242
00:24:12,336 --> 00:24:15,383
You should never use it, only if you really, really, really have to.

243
00:24:16,451 --> 00:24:24,995
So the result was a 20 minute proof of concept prototype that was really, really closer to what the final game actually is today.

244
00:24:25,475 --> 00:24:28,737
It was a 3D visual novel with a straight forward flow.

245
00:24:29,717 --> 00:24:36,120
The memory exploration mechanic was still there, but it was not a puzzle game mechanic anymore.

246
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:43,484
It was just about moving around the memory and finding clues so that you're able to understand what's happened.

247
00:24:44,344 --> 00:24:51,071
And we had a consistent art direction, which was one of the most important part of the feedback that we got.

248
00:24:52,012 --> 00:24:53,653
So this time everything was perfect.

249
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:59,599
Well, nothing is ever perfect, but everything was comfortable enough for us to jump into production.

250
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:00,200
And that's

251
00:25:02,446 --> 00:25:10,252
what we got two years afterwards, the third chapter of the story, the coming of age story, the growth that we had.

252
00:25:10,752 --> 00:25:16,456
So first, let me show you what the end result is through a little trailer for The Wreck.

253
00:25:26,404 --> 00:25:29,146
All right, I'll tell you this story.

254
00:25:37,395 --> 00:25:39,296
Is, is she going to die?

255
00:25:42,717 --> 00:25:44,498
We just found out that mom might die.

256
00:25:45,118 --> 00:25:46,279
Does that mean nothing to you?

257
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:49,420
Everything that happened to us, did end this.

258
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,840
There was a reason.

259
00:25:54,602 --> 00:25:56,222
Why the hell do I feel so alone?

260
00:25:56,823 --> 00:25:58,843
Do I really have to be so angry?

261
00:26:01,304 --> 00:26:02,345
Do I really hate my mother?

262
00:26:04,793 --> 00:26:05,754
Memory is weird.

263
00:26:06,174 --> 00:26:08,836
You suddenly remember these moments without knowing why.

264
00:26:09,196 --> 00:26:12,759
Until you realize it's trying to teach you something crucial.

265
00:26:14,361 --> 00:26:15,441
No one can live like this.

266
00:26:15,722 --> 00:26:16,622
Not really.

267
00:26:17,063 --> 00:26:18,404
But we can change.

268
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:20,185
Everyone can change.

269
00:26:31,134 --> 00:26:32,635
I have to leave it all behind.

270
00:26:34,946 --> 00:26:44,213
It's funny that I only realized now that The Wreck is a game about being able to change, and that's probably the best asset we had during production, being able to change.

271
00:26:44,293 --> 00:26:48,276
Because what happened is what I call the second game syndrome.

272
00:26:48,736 --> 00:26:53,139
It's really hard to be very keen to live up to a first success.

273
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:59,283
Our success was not huge by any means, but it was already a big thing for us.

274
00:27:00,103 --> 00:27:05,046
And we wanted to prove that we could do something else, something even better.

275
00:27:05,186 --> 00:27:14,972
We didn't want to make a second text-based adventure because we felt like maybe we are up for something even better.

276
00:27:15,732 --> 00:27:18,634
And we wanted to prove ourselves right.

277
00:27:19,713 --> 00:27:22,495
But we were still relatively inexperienced.

278
00:27:22,555 --> 00:27:24,316
I would say very inexperienced.

279
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:32,521
Just because you've shipped a game, or even in our case, several small games before that, doesn't mean you've got it all figured out.

280
00:27:33,021 --> 00:27:36,343
I don't think anybody has it all figured out in video games anyway.

281
00:27:37,196 --> 00:27:48,004
The risks with this second game syndrome are first being miserable because of course when you live in delusion and then suddenly the brick of reality crushes the

282
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:54,492
Strawberry pie of your illusions, you feel really bad.

283
00:27:54,932 --> 00:27:57,454
And you also make the people you work with feel bad.

284
00:27:57,555 --> 00:28:00,237
We had to scale down for the second prototype.

285
00:28:00,697 --> 00:28:06,722
We had to just keep people insecure, although they were very talented and they worked really well.

286
00:28:07,282 --> 00:28:09,043
And that's really something I'm not proud of.

287
00:28:09,904 --> 00:28:11,706
And that's why I'm sharing it with you today.

288
00:28:12,046 --> 00:28:15,590
Just so you can avoid those kind of experiences.

289
00:28:16,591 --> 00:28:19,174
And just so you can avoid tanking your game.

290
00:28:19,234 --> 00:28:23,618
Because Bury Me, My Love is a game that really could have not existed at all.

291
00:28:23,898 --> 00:28:26,221
So I'm really happy that it does.

292
00:28:27,202 --> 00:28:31,664
So what would be the solutions to that second game syndrome?

293
00:28:31,945 --> 00:28:42,010
The first would be not to romanticize success, not to look novel gaze too much, and not to consider that you've got it all figured out because something worked for you.

294
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:49,278
But you have to remember what you enjoyed and what your players enjoyed in your first game.

295
00:28:49,418 --> 00:28:50,720
Because that's how you grow.

296
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:55,545
And that's how you grow as a person, as a designer, as a creative director, sure.

297
00:28:56,106 --> 00:28:58,929
But that's also how you grow as a studio, as a company.

298
00:28:59,169 --> 00:29:01,351
And it's really important to have a

299
00:29:01,952 --> 00:29:05,895
have a long-term view about how you are going to develop.

300
00:29:06,115 --> 00:29:08,536
So how do you respect your studio's DNA?

301
00:29:08,817 --> 00:29:22,406
How do you come with a second project that, yes, is not the same as the first one, but, yes, also is in the same style and the same things that worked for you the first time?

302
00:29:22,626 --> 00:29:31,292
You should preciously try to work on them and take a fresh look at them and see how you can renew without necessarily changing everything.

303
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:36,655
Another point that is very important, of course, is to leave your ego behind.

304
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,396
I think I'm very guilty of that.

305
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:45,840
And my ego and my inexperience were the things that put the project at risk at some point.

306
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:48,682
And so, yes, you have to forget about that.

307
00:29:48,782 --> 00:29:59,269
And you have to just think that you have to address it like it's your first game and like everything is to do all over again so that you don't fall in the same pitfalls that I

308
00:30:00,149 --> 00:30:00,849
fell into.

309
00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:07,571
And the last and most important advice would be to be ready to get some kicks in the butt.

310
00:30:07,952 --> 00:30:15,414
Because I think it's the most important part, being aware that you can have flaws in your process and in your project.

311
00:30:16,094 --> 00:30:27,102
And knowing that you know people that can actually help you and give you feedback that is sometimes harsh to hear, but also life-saving, is something you have to be ready for.

312
00:30:27,302 --> 00:30:30,524
And that would be the best advice I have to give to you today.

313
00:30:30,824 --> 00:30:31,725
Thanks a lot for coming.

314
00:30:31,765 --> 00:30:37,569
I hope you'll like The Wreck, because in the end, that's probably our favorite game so far.

315
00:30:37,589 --> 00:30:38,849
So yeah, I hope you'll like it.

316
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:39,570
Thank you.

317
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,067
If you have questions we still have a little bit of time I think because there's no session afterwards so you can ask them.

318
00:30:56,513 --> 00:30:58,336
And again it's Friday so yeah I understand.

319
00:31:08,452 --> 00:31:18,423
Since the Wreck was so challenging, did you find, I'm not sure if you started on your third game, how do you, you know, be energized to do it again?

320
00:31:18,463 --> 00:31:19,624
Are you a little traumatized?

321
00:31:19,724 --> 00:31:20,986
Like, oh no, we're going to do it again.

322
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:30,295
Yes, I am, but I'm also very happy with all the things that we've learned and I also know things that I will never do the same again.

323
00:31:30,956 --> 00:31:34,419
So I'll be probably, hopefully, way more careful with the next game.

324
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:43,008
So I feel actually confident and I also know where to set the boundaries and where to set the limits and what to be very careful of.

325
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:53,139
which doesn't mean by any means that we won't make any mistake, probably we will again, but hopefully not the same mistake so we can learn and I can give another talk in five years in the next GDC.

326
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,500
Great, thank you.

327
00:31:54,721 --> 00:31:54,941
Thank you.

328
00:32:01,147 --> 00:32:08,833
Your introduction really reminded me of my own position in my company, like being a writer, designer, manager, director, creative director.

329
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:11,835
So it's good to see someone else doing so many things.

330
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,597
Too many hats.

331
00:32:14,377 --> 00:32:15,258
It's tiring though, right?

332
00:32:15,518 --> 00:32:15,738
Sorry?

333
00:32:15,898 --> 00:32:16,699
It's tiring though.

334
00:32:16,899 --> 00:32:17,640
Oh yeah, it's tiring.

335
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,682
And you can't do one thing just as well as you want to.

336
00:32:20,942 --> 00:32:21,082
Yeah.

337
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:28,230
So I joined a company that was making their second game, and we're at the cry phase.

338
00:32:28,671 --> 00:32:39,403
I mean, I'm going to come back and I'm going to say, OK, we have this method I saw in this talk because we just got the really harsh feedback, or not harsh feedback, but good, but...

339
00:32:42,282 --> 00:32:46,447
Hard to hear feedback just this week from another colleague, right?

340
00:32:47,648 --> 00:32:55,477
And is there any further advice, having feedback that requires you to fundamentally change your game?

341
00:32:56,398 --> 00:32:59,461
And basically, how do I go and apply the CRY method?

342
00:33:00,362 --> 00:33:09,505
Yes, I think feedback that requires you to fundamentally change your game is not what I would call good feedback, because you can't ask that from a game dev, you know.

343
00:33:09,845 --> 00:33:14,106
They have an idea, they have a vision, and they want to make a specific kind of game.

344
00:33:14,606 --> 00:33:26,329
So coming to them and telling them you have to do something completely different is as good a feedback as saying you have to stop it completely and start again a new project, which can be a good idea sometimes.

345
00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:28,250
But it has to come from the devs,

346
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,611
draw their own conclusions.

347
00:33:31,351 --> 00:33:45,878
So that's why I would say that you you should probably not listen to that feedback too much but you should try to find if there is feedback that can actually keep the core idea of your game and make it way better than it currently is.

348
00:33:46,118 --> 00:33:48,659
So never disregard feedback but

349
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:56,941
If you want to keep your core ID, if you still believe in it, if you still believe it's going to work, that's not the feedback you're looking for.

350
00:33:57,381 --> 00:34:04,143
You're more looking for feedback that can specifically apply to points in your game that you should change, I would say.

351
00:34:04,863 --> 00:34:05,143
I see.

352
00:34:05,883 --> 00:34:08,844
We do agree with the feedback though, so it's a long story, it's complicated.

353
00:34:08,884 --> 00:34:09,844
Thank you so much for the talk.

354
00:34:10,264 --> 00:34:12,005
Maybe we can exchange cards later.

355
00:34:12,245 --> 00:34:12,565
Yeah, sure.

356
00:34:15,905 --> 00:34:18,672
Okay, thanks a lot and have a good rest of GDC.
