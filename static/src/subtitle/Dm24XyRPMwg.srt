00:00:05,401 --> 00:00:12,127
Hello, thank you. I'm Allie Overton and I want to talk to you about common problems in game art and how we can solve them.

2
00:00:13,288 --> 00:00:19,174
So this talk is going to cover some game art basics because it's for those of you that don't have a lot of experience with game art

3
00:00:19,574 --> 00:00:20,995
and are introducing it to your games.

4
00:00:21,836 --> 00:00:28,102
We're going to talk about critique, the way we can treat things instinctually, and some ways that we can do it traditional

5
00:00:28,702 --> 00:00:30,604
and apply that to practical game critique.

6
00:00:31,459 --> 00:00:36,242
Also going to talk about vocabulary, probably terms you've heard, but maybe that you haven't

7
00:00:36,282 --> 00:00:37,702
thought about as well as you could have.

8
00:00:38,423 --> 00:00:40,404
And we're going to go over some examples.

9
00:00:40,664 --> 00:00:42,865
So let's start with an example of an example.

10
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:48,568
So you're looking at your game and you're noticing that your character isn't as visible

11
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:50,969
as you would like it to be against the background.

12
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,851
What tools do you have at your disposal to make your character more visible?

13
00:00:55,372 --> 00:00:59,354
What is your player looking at instead of your character?

14
00:01:00,254 --> 00:01:00,995
Things to think about.

15
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,416
Well, let's start with critique.

16
00:01:03,516 --> 00:01:06,076
Critique is a tool for finding the strengths

17
00:01:06,136 --> 00:01:07,417
and weaknesses of an image.

18
00:01:08,057 --> 00:01:11,078
So in our instinctive way, we critique things

19
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:14,118
as we'll see an image and we'll immediately judge it.

20
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,279
You have an opinion the first second you see the picture.

21
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:20,060
And then you justify your opinion.

22
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,600
You might say something like,

23
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,861
hmm, this picture's no good because that I think is a cat

24
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:27,801
and that's not a cat's face.

25
00:01:31,517 --> 00:01:32,497
This can be valid.

26
00:01:32,537 --> 00:01:35,938
There's plenty of times when this does merit valid feedback,

27
00:01:36,018 --> 00:01:38,119
but you might see an image like this one

28
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,259
and offer the feedback that it's too blue.

29
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,060
And so with that, you or your artist fix it.

30
00:01:44,921 --> 00:01:45,821
Bam, it's green.

31
00:01:46,341 --> 00:01:47,141
Problem solves.

32
00:01:47,921 --> 00:01:48,982
Or is it really?

33
00:01:49,462 --> 00:01:51,782
Maybe what you meant was there was more colors needed.

34
00:01:52,123 --> 00:01:54,163
So it's important to know what you're looking for

35
00:01:54,203 --> 00:01:55,403
when you're critiquing an image.

36
00:01:56,235 --> 00:01:58,756
So in traditional critique, there's a four-step structure.

37
00:01:59,116 --> 00:02:00,277
You start by describing it.

38
00:02:00,297 --> 00:02:02,798
It's a literal description of content.

39
00:02:03,258 --> 00:02:04,679
You look at an image and you say,

40
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:07,920
there's two people, one of them's holding a pitchfork,

41
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,201
they're in front of a building,

42
00:02:09,341 --> 00:02:11,102
they're both looking pretty frowny,

43
00:02:12,262 --> 00:02:15,443
and that sort of thing, very content-based.

44
00:02:15,564 --> 00:02:16,464
And then you analyze.

45
00:02:17,144 --> 00:02:20,106
If this is a piece of traditional art,

46
00:02:20,286 --> 00:02:22,767
you might talk about how it was made with acrylic

47
00:02:23,427 --> 00:02:24,908
and what type of tools they made.

48
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:30,971
If it's digital art, you might tell them that it's made in Photoshop and you can tell by the pixels.

49
00:02:31,371 --> 00:02:37,017
No matter what type of art it is, you talk about the way that color is used, the way contrast is used.

50
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,000
And then you interpret.

51
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,564
This is the sort of thing that people like to joke about when they're critiquing art.

52
00:02:42,584 --> 00:02:46,868
They're like, hmm, yes, the spider painting is fascinating, but what does it say?

53
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:55,553
And there is some element of what does it mean to interpreting, but it's more about what did the artist intend.

54
00:02:56,573 --> 00:02:59,255
Maybe the splatter painting really was just to get out some anger.

55
00:02:59,756 --> 00:03:04,159
Maybe this portrait is a portrait of two people, it's very realistic based on who they are.

56
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,241
Or maybe it's a commentary on small town life.

57
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:09,163
What do you think the intention of the artist was?

58
00:03:09,924 --> 00:03:12,926
And then, now that you've collected all of this information, you can judge.

59
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:20,257
You know how it was made, you have an inkling of why it was made, and so you can determine if it was effective.

60
00:03:21,798 --> 00:03:27,283
So in that portrait, was it an accurate portrait in the splatter painting? Do you think the artist feels better now?

61
00:03:29,104 --> 00:03:32,127
So how does this apply to practical critique for game art?

62
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:38,593
Well, there's one key difference, but most of the fundamentals are the same, and that difference is that you get to define your own goals.

63
00:03:38,753 --> 00:03:39,593
This is your game.

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,642
You know what you want to do with your art,

65
00:03:41,702 --> 00:03:43,704
you know what sort of thing you're trying to get across.

66
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:46,706
There's a few goals that are very common in game art.

67
00:03:46,906 --> 00:03:48,768
One of them is portraying information.

68
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,290
You often want your player to be able to tell

69
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,052
at a glance where danger is.

70
00:03:53,712 --> 00:03:55,774
You might want to control their focus.

71
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:57,916
Similar to information, you want them to look at

72
00:03:57,976 --> 00:04:01,059
something in particular, a face, a dialogue.

73
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:03,561
It's very hard to get players to actually look at dialogue.

74
00:04:04,242 --> 00:04:05,343
And then there's emotion.

75
00:04:06,402 --> 00:04:08,703
Some games, this doesn't really affect them too much,

76
00:04:08,763 --> 00:04:12,104
but there's very genre-based games like horror and others

77
00:04:12,644 --> 00:04:14,604
that trying to get across emotion with your art

78
00:04:14,664 --> 00:04:15,865
is very important to them.

79
00:04:16,905 --> 00:04:17,685
And then style.

80
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:19,206
Style can be a variable thing.

81
00:04:19,286 --> 00:04:22,287
Maybe you are a solo programmer and your style

82
00:04:22,347 --> 00:04:23,707
is going to be minimalist and simple

83
00:04:23,767 --> 00:04:25,127
because that's within your skill level.

84
00:04:25,607 --> 00:04:27,268
Or maybe you're working with an artist

85
00:04:27,288 --> 00:04:29,348
who's incredibly talented and you want to show them off.

86
00:04:30,142 --> 00:04:36,385
Maybe marketing is a goal of yours and you want art that supports marketing and might go viral on Twitter.

87
00:04:37,646 --> 00:04:43,609
Whatever your goals are, now that you know them and you've established them, and they can vary from these and include these and others,

88
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:46,630
you can determine the effectiveness of your visuals.

89
00:04:47,571 --> 00:04:55,154
So, in V's, they make their information very clear using bright colors and interesting shapes

90
00:04:55,174 --> 00:04:57,696
so that you can immediately read that something is dangerous.

91
00:04:58,636 --> 00:04:59,396
In Dream Daddy,

92
00:04:59,937 --> 00:05:02,879
They use detail and color and our natural inclination

93
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:04,961
to look at faces to draw your eye to the character,

94
00:05:05,281 --> 00:05:07,123
as well as a really large text box

95
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,884
to make people actually look at the text.

96
00:05:09,664 --> 00:05:11,986
And then in Limbo, they have interesting silhouettes

97
00:05:12,106 --> 00:05:15,709
and desaturated colors that make you feel

98
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:17,390
the spookiness factor even more.

99
00:05:18,091 --> 00:05:20,973
And in Bastion, they intentionally have

100
00:05:21,013 --> 00:05:23,375
a more elaborate style that is very memorable

101
00:05:23,435 --> 00:05:26,837
and interesting, but not necessarily a requirement

102
00:05:26,937 --> 00:05:28,518
for their gameplay.

103
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:33,802
So with that, where is this image succeeding?

104
00:05:34,022 --> 00:05:35,103
What can we change about it?

105
00:05:35,443 --> 00:05:37,703
And what tools do we have to improve it?

106
00:05:38,224 --> 00:05:41,324
Well, art vocabulary, this is how we talk about the tools

107
00:05:41,805 --> 00:05:43,565
that we have to influence our visuals.

108
00:05:43,585 --> 00:05:45,206
And there's a bunch of common ones.

109
00:05:45,926 --> 00:05:47,446
So let's start with color.

110
00:05:47,566 --> 00:05:48,847
You've probably heard of it.

111
00:05:49,687 --> 00:05:51,788
So when we talk about color,

112
00:05:51,808 --> 00:05:53,168
we might say that something is blue

113
00:05:53,268 --> 00:05:54,729
and we want it to be a blue thing.

114
00:05:55,069 --> 00:05:57,369
But blue could be blue or blue or blue.

115
00:05:58,443 --> 00:06:01,663
So it's proper to be more specific, it's much more helpful.

116
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,124
So we usually talk about value,

117
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,184
because value is one of the main ways

118
00:06:06,224 --> 00:06:08,185
we can make contrast in a visual.

119
00:06:09,165 --> 00:06:11,425
Value is the light and dark in an image,

120
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:14,206
the gradient from brightest white to darkest black.

121
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:19,487
And hue is next, it's ignoring saturation and value.

122
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:21,827
Hue is basically color as we're learning as a kid.

123
00:06:21,887 --> 00:06:23,928
It's the rainbow, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple.

124
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:30,073
And then saturation is how gray or vibrant something is.

125
00:06:30,453 --> 00:06:32,374
This is regardless of hue and value.

126
00:06:32,394 --> 00:06:36,176
Some people think saturation is also influenced by value,

127
00:06:36,216 --> 00:06:37,956
but they're completely separate from each other.

128
00:06:39,077 --> 00:06:42,638
So contrast can be between any of these elements.

129
00:06:42,859 --> 00:06:45,500
Value contrast, like I said, is one of the most effective ones,

130
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,502
but it can also be a contrast of hues or a contrast of saturation.

131
00:06:51,113 --> 00:06:53,294
Chess is an example of contrast of value.

132
00:06:53,354 --> 00:06:55,715
It's the lightest white versus the darkest black.

133
00:06:56,595 --> 00:07:00,137
Checkers is an example of contrast of saturation.

134
00:07:00,657 --> 00:07:04,039
Very red, very vibrant versus desaturated black.

135
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:07,380
And Chinese checkers is a contrast of hues,

136
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,801
where you have only differentiation between hues

137
00:07:11,342 --> 00:07:13,483
and not in value or saturation.

138
00:07:14,703 --> 00:07:15,944
So when we talk about color,

139
00:07:16,404 --> 00:07:17,945
it's important to try and talk about

140
00:07:18,025 --> 00:07:19,545
all of these elements individually.

141
00:07:20,343 --> 00:07:23,345
It's more valuable to say I want a light, bright sky

142
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:27,367
than it is to say I want a blue sky on its own.

143
00:07:29,127 --> 00:07:31,268
So composition, there's a whole lot of elements

144
00:07:31,308 --> 00:07:32,909
to composition in art, but one of the ones

145
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:35,130
that applies to gameplay the most is density.

146
00:07:36,551 --> 00:07:39,352
High-density visuals are chaotic, busy, and noisy.

147
00:07:40,012 --> 00:07:43,013
Density is basically just how much stuff is on the screen.

148
00:07:43,093 --> 00:07:44,214
So if there's a bunch of stuff,

149
00:07:44,594 --> 00:07:46,355
there's a bunch of stuff you gotta pay attention to.

150
00:07:46,815 --> 00:07:48,656
They can make your visuals feel

151
00:07:49,418 --> 00:07:54,920
more closed in, they can make you feel frantic, but they can also make your player space seem

152
00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:00,681
more alive and vivid and full. And density can be either in the amount of content or

153
00:08:01,362 --> 00:08:06,483
in the detail of the content. So in Enter the Gungeon, the amount of content they have,

154
00:08:06,543 --> 00:08:11,785
because it's a bullet hell, inherently is a more high density visual. They try to lower the density

155
00:08:11,805 --> 00:08:16,586
of the visuals in the background to make it more clear. In Bastion, they actually increase the

156
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:18,747
density of the visuals to make it a more full.

157
00:08:19,402 --> 00:08:22,944
and immersive environment to add more detail to the art style.

158
00:08:24,344 --> 00:08:25,745
Low density is the opposite.

159
00:08:25,825 --> 00:08:27,366
It's open, it's minimal, it's airy.

160
00:08:27,446 --> 00:08:29,667
It's easy to follow your eye through the space

161
00:08:29,828 --> 00:08:30,908
and see things clearly.

162
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:35,751
It can also have the risk of looking unfinished or unpolished,

163
00:08:36,571 --> 00:08:38,332
especially if you're doing a very minimal game.

164
00:08:38,813 --> 00:08:40,874
Thomas' Alone is a very minimal game

165
00:08:40,934 --> 00:08:45,717
that avoids this problem because it uses texture and lighting.

166
00:08:46,268 --> 00:08:49,429
to fill in the lack of density that the gameplay offers.

167
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:52,190
On the other hand, the mortician's shell

168
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,471
is fairly dense in terms of interactability on the screen,

169
00:08:56,971 --> 00:09:00,092
whereas it's lower in detail, which

170
00:09:00,132 --> 00:09:02,213
allows you to see what's going on more clearly.

171
00:09:03,713 --> 00:09:04,573
And then there's style.

172
00:09:05,374 --> 00:09:08,515
Style, we often talk about stylized versus realistic.

173
00:09:10,396 --> 00:09:12,777
But we also end up talking about cartoony.

174
00:09:13,457 --> 00:09:15,298
And cartoony is a bit of a trap word.

175
00:09:15,358 --> 00:09:16,759
It means a lot of different things

176
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,939
to a lot of different people.

177
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:20,380
So it's important to be more specific,

178
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,861
break things down into their elements.

179
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:23,582
So talking about color again,

180
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:26,763
you might have very saturated colors

181
00:09:26,843 --> 00:09:29,284
and these are really good for giving moods in a scene.

182
00:09:29,804 --> 00:09:32,485
The long dark offers a much more wondrous feeling

183
00:09:32,565 --> 00:09:33,246
for its colors.

184
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:36,147
Whereas games that have more realistic colors

185
00:09:36,207 --> 00:09:36,447
give you

186
00:09:37,132 --> 00:09:39,973
a more sense of weight to your choices and your actions.

187
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,753
You feel like the things that you do in the game

188
00:09:41,773 --> 00:09:43,654
should have more real world repercussion.

189
00:09:45,154 --> 00:09:47,675
Line is one of those aspects of cartooniness

190
00:09:47,695 --> 00:09:48,555
that you might talk about,

191
00:09:48,595 --> 00:09:50,275
but it's a very graphic sort of thing.

192
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:52,236
It helps delineate things from their backgrounds.

193
00:09:52,256 --> 00:09:54,836
If you do it in a more realistic game, it's very notable.

194
00:09:56,197 --> 00:09:59,017
And if you remove line from a visual

195
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,278
that you might say is more stylized,

196
00:10:01,378 --> 00:10:03,158
it really emphasizes the mood of a piece,

197
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:05,779
pointing more towards hue.

198
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:11,612
and value choices than towards the overall stylization.

199
00:10:12,293 --> 00:10:13,173
And then proportion.

200
00:10:13,353 --> 00:10:15,775
With funny proportions, you can stylize them

201
00:10:15,835 --> 00:10:17,576
to the point where a character's head

202
00:10:17,636 --> 00:10:18,716
is as big as his body,

203
00:10:19,197 --> 00:10:21,238
and that will make things more cheery and funny.

204
00:10:21,658 --> 00:10:24,380
But on the other hand, if you have more realistic proportions

205
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,421
in an otherwise stylized style,

206
00:10:26,921 --> 00:10:29,823
you end up having more immersion

207
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:30,964
into the mood of that character.

208
00:10:30,984 --> 00:10:33,025
You think of them as more of an elaborate,

209
00:10:33,085 --> 00:10:33,965
fully-fleshed human.

210
00:10:35,173 --> 00:10:36,273
And then there's light and shadow.

211
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:39,475
Zelda covers a lot of these through its games.

212
00:10:39,695 --> 00:10:42,496
You can have absolutely no delineation of light and shadow,

213
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:46,158
or you can have flat light and shadow,

214
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:49,099
or you can have large gradations of light and shadow.

215
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,521
Whatever of these elements, color, line, proportion,

216
00:10:53,742 --> 00:10:55,723
light and shallow that you use,

217
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:58,764
they can be anything in stylized and realistic.

218
00:10:58,804 --> 00:11:02,306
It can be very stylized color with very realistic shadow.

219
00:11:02,366 --> 00:11:02,886
You can have...

220
00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:08,120
line on extremely realistic things, but the most important thing is to be intentional about your

221
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,341
choices. Make sure that they all go together and are cohesive. In Pokémon Sun and Moon,

222
00:11:14,001 --> 00:11:19,483
the character has a large head and it's about the same size as their torso, and because of the level

223
00:11:19,503 --> 00:11:25,944
of stylization throughout the rest of the style, it makes a cohesive piece. But if you have a more

224
00:11:25,984 --> 00:11:28,365
realistic game and you have a giant head...

225
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:30,490
It stands out a little bit weird.

226
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,390
Now, in Lara Croft's big head mode,

227
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:33,511
they did that intentionally.

228
00:11:33,951 --> 00:11:36,412
But if you do it on accident, nobody's

229
00:11:36,452 --> 00:11:37,692
going to take your game seriously.

230
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,173
So that was a lot.

231
00:11:40,193 --> 00:11:42,154
But let's talk about some examples.

232
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,935
So that example we talked about before,

233
00:11:45,855 --> 00:11:48,296
we can pretty quickly tell that it's not

234
00:11:48,336 --> 00:11:49,697
a high-density environment.

235
00:11:49,797 --> 00:11:52,258
So that's not a factor in controlling the focus.

236
00:11:52,298 --> 00:11:54,579
There's no frequency of detail that's

237
00:11:54,619 --> 00:11:55,959
distracting us from the player.

238
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,011
So we can go to our color things.

239
00:11:59,471 --> 00:12:01,953
What in the color spectrum is affecting this?

240
00:12:02,073 --> 00:12:04,975
Well, hue, there's a delineation of hue

241
00:12:05,035 --> 00:12:06,416
between the character and the background,

242
00:12:06,436 --> 00:12:07,377
so that's not the problem,

243
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:08,918
but the real thing is value.

244
00:12:09,258 --> 00:12:12,060
If you take away the hues, the saturation,

245
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,040
and look at it in grayscale,

246
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,881
you can immediately tell that the character

247
00:12:14,921 --> 00:12:16,262
doesn't stand out against the background.

248
00:12:16,763 --> 00:12:18,444
So it's good to up the values,

249
00:12:18,524 --> 00:12:21,646
make the character more of a high contrast focus,

250
00:12:22,126 --> 00:12:23,947
and that'll pop out more against the background.

251
00:12:24,546 --> 00:12:26,987
immediately it's a lot easier to see what's going on

252
00:12:27,487 --> 00:12:30,788
and focus on where you want to, where you're on the player.

253
00:12:31,808 --> 00:12:32,988
So that's that in value.

254
00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:35,649
And if you compare it to the original,

255
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,990
it's a lot easier to see what's going on.

256
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:43,051
All right, so in this game, this is the sort of game

257
00:12:43,111 --> 00:12:45,552
where you're trying to light up a whole grid of networks.

258
00:12:46,492 --> 00:12:48,833
But right now you can see the lit parts very easily

259
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,293
because in the hierarchy of value.

260
00:12:51,566 --> 00:12:54,928
they're very bright. They're the only thing that contrasts heavily with the background.

261
00:12:55,549 --> 00:13:01,152
But in this sort of game, what matters is not just the lit parts, also the dark parts. It's important

262
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:07,636
to give each piece of information in your games the same level, if they matter the same amount.

263
00:13:08,177 --> 00:13:14,381
So if we bring the dark parts up in value to match, it's a lot easier to get the information

264
00:13:14,421 --> 00:13:18,103
you need, because you need both parts of the puzzle to solve it. Before...

265
00:13:18,802 --> 00:13:21,003
it was not the same level in the hierarchy

266
00:13:21,063 --> 00:13:22,824
and you couldn't focus on the information

267
00:13:23,324 --> 00:13:25,265
you needed to solve the puzzle.

268
00:13:25,865 --> 00:13:29,107
So here is it before, it's hard to focus on the dark parts

269
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,568
that you need that information to solve the puzzle.

270
00:13:32,288 --> 00:13:33,849
Now it's a lot easier to balance it,

271
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:36,130
so you can add contrast and hue to solve that problem.

272
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,591
All right, so this is the sort of thing

273
00:13:38,611 --> 00:13:39,551
that happens when you're like.

274
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,981
I want a really bright, colorful game.

275
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:45,342
And you're extremely literal about what color is

276
00:13:45,862 --> 00:13:47,603
and your saturation is just max.

277
00:13:47,643 --> 00:13:50,884
Trees are green, sun is yellow, heroes have red hair,

278
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:52,785
and it's all as bright as possible.

279
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:58,808
So just cool it with your saturation, basically.

280
00:13:59,668 --> 00:14:01,889
You can do things to make your game interesting

281
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:04,190
without just making it as in your face as possible

282
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,711
in like an MS Paint drawing

283
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:07,192
you made when you were 13 years old.

284
00:14:08,493 --> 00:14:13,237
So if you calm down your saturation, you can make more interesting, less literal color

285
00:14:13,277 --> 00:14:13,737
choices.

286
00:14:14,318 --> 00:14:16,259
A tree trunk can be purple, whatever.

287
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:21,763
It's more interesting and less literal, and it catches the eye as much, but it's not quite

288
00:14:21,823 --> 00:14:22,323
as painful.

289
00:14:22,744 --> 00:14:26,467
And if you still want to go even further, you can be even less literal, stylize your

290
00:14:26,507 --> 00:14:30,790
colors even more, and do something a little weird, and people will find that very memorable,

291
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,451
but not painful.

292
00:14:33,892 --> 00:14:36,454
And then so you can have something that people like.

293
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:38,291
at the end of the day.

294
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:39,812
So visual clarity.

295
00:14:39,892 --> 00:14:41,852
This can happen when you're trying to reuse assets,

296
00:14:42,052 --> 00:14:45,453
especially to minimize the amount of art labor you're doing.

297
00:14:46,174 --> 00:14:47,694
Like you get something in the assets there

298
00:14:47,714 --> 00:14:48,614
and you just recolor it.

299
00:14:49,015 --> 00:14:51,075
You have a green ally and a red enemy.

300
00:14:51,195 --> 00:14:52,716
But if you're colorblind,

301
00:14:52,816 --> 00:14:55,236
these enemies look basically the same to you.

302
00:14:55,957 --> 00:14:58,437
And there's ways to work around that.

303
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:01,558
Like value, contrast, works for everybody.

304
00:15:02,099 --> 00:15:04,219
If you make adjustments to help with people

305
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:05,280
with visual impairments.

306
00:15:05,807 --> 00:15:07,988
It helps everybody delineate things better,

307
00:15:08,348 --> 00:15:10,489
not just people who are visually impaired.

308
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:12,930
So other options are to,

309
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,271
like see, you can immediately tell

310
00:15:15,471 --> 00:15:18,273
that it's more different for everyone.

311
00:15:18,853 --> 00:15:20,394
Other options are to include symbology,

312
00:15:20,474 --> 00:15:23,295
not just in character design or faces,

313
00:15:23,396 --> 00:15:25,597
but if you have a particle effect that's red

314
00:15:25,657 --> 00:15:27,177
when it's good and green when it's bad,

315
00:15:27,638 --> 00:15:30,999
add some sort of symbol like stars or angry Xs

316
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:34,081
to delineate symbolically what's good or bad.

317
00:15:34,525 --> 00:15:36,907
so that everyone can tell what's going on more easily.

318
00:15:36,927 --> 00:15:40,910
So you can see that this is much easier to see for everyone

319
00:15:41,591 --> 00:15:43,232
whether or not you're colorblind.

320
00:15:44,793 --> 00:15:46,715
All right, one of the challenges of 3D lighting

321
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:50,238
is when you put a light in your scene

322
00:15:50,978 --> 00:15:54,041
and you realize everything is still too dark,

323
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:56,042
so just keep upping the intensity of the lighting.

324
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:57,183
This is fairly common,

325
00:15:57,584 --> 00:15:59,645
and people are getting first into 3D art

326
00:16:00,106 --> 00:16:01,187
or making 3D games.

327
00:16:01,847 --> 00:16:03,228
So most...

328
00:16:03,748 --> 00:16:09,693
engines and 3D renderers have an environmental light or a skybox which you can increase the

329
00:16:09,793 --> 00:16:15,617
lighting value of so that you have a flat level of light. It makes your shadows less dark. It

330
00:16:16,037 --> 00:16:21,642
decreases the overall contrast of your image and lets you do stuff more intentionally instead

331
00:16:21,662 --> 00:16:25,805
of accidentally having black value shadows distracting from the art that you're trying

332
00:16:25,845 --> 00:16:29,308
to pour across. And then once you do that you can use color.

333
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:34,262
And using a warm color can give you more of a narrative experience like candlelight,

334
00:16:34,762 --> 00:16:39,304
instead of the intense high white that makes you feel like you're in an office.

335
00:16:40,164 --> 00:16:44,885
And then you can also use color other ways to just affect the mood, make things feel magical,

336
00:16:44,965 --> 00:16:52,707
make things feel silly or spiritual or just fun. This is it before, and this is it once you try to

337
00:16:52,807 --> 00:16:56,788
do lighting more intentionally, instead of just trying to light it enough that everyone can see.

338
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,470
And some fancy backgrounds.

339
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,651
So you have a game, you put a fancy background in it,

340
00:17:01,731 --> 00:17:04,231
and now nobody can stop looking at the background

341
00:17:04,251 --> 00:17:06,112
and they're not paying attention to your player anymore.

342
00:17:06,852 --> 00:17:11,133
So, it's another thing where there's value contrast problems.

343
00:17:11,173 --> 00:17:13,413
There's more value contrast in the background

344
00:17:13,473 --> 00:17:14,694
than there is in the player.

345
00:17:14,714 --> 00:17:16,434
This is also a density thing.

346
00:17:16,854 --> 00:17:18,114
There's a high density background

347
00:17:18,154 --> 00:17:19,255
and a low density player.

348
00:17:19,635 --> 00:17:22,155
But that's also a type of contrast.

349
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:25,096
A contrast of densities can also be valuable.

350
00:17:25,136 --> 00:17:26,676
So that's not the worst part.

351
00:17:26,696 --> 00:17:27,357
The worst part is.

352
00:17:27,938 --> 00:17:31,160
the value contrast being more interesting in the background.

353
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,941
So if we drop down the value contrast,

354
00:17:33,981 --> 00:17:36,422
make it more of a mid-tone, the player comes out.

355
00:17:36,802 --> 00:17:39,743
But it's also good for the player itself

356
00:17:39,823 --> 00:17:43,004
to be more high contrast because you want to be able

357
00:17:43,064 --> 00:17:44,585
to do a lot of things with your backgrounds.

358
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,205
You want them to be able to be diverse.

359
00:17:46,685 --> 00:17:48,246
If you make a high contrast player,

360
00:17:48,746 --> 00:17:51,247
it can be more intentionally put

361
00:17:51,367 --> 00:17:53,468
against a low contrast background

362
00:17:53,748 --> 00:17:56,349
and you can have a wide variety of low contrast backgrounds.

363
00:17:57,537 --> 00:18:01,759
You can also solve this problem by having a light player against a dark background,

364
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:04,720
but that gives you less options for the diversity of your backgrounds.

365
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,061
You can also do a dark player against a light background.

366
00:18:07,481 --> 00:18:12,442
But that leads you to end up making the same choices in your environment art

367
00:18:12,542 --> 00:18:13,743
for the rest of your gameplay.

368
00:18:15,624 --> 00:18:18,685
So that's what it was like originally, and this is our revision.

369
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:22,446
You can immediately see that the player is a lot easier to pick out against the content.

370
00:18:23,788 --> 00:18:26,650
All right, too cute is a thing that happens a lot in art.

371
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,452
People have a lot of opinions about what level of cuteness

372
00:18:30,492 --> 00:18:31,572
they want in their games.

373
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,774
And there's a lot of elements to cuteness

374
00:18:33,954 --> 00:18:35,935
that is kind of vague and confusing.

375
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:38,336
One immediately obvious one about this one

376
00:18:38,456 --> 00:18:41,918
is that it's a very saturated green zombie

377
00:18:41,998 --> 00:18:43,499
against a spooky background.

378
00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:45,500
So if we drop down the saturation,

379
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,701
immediately the mood, the style that you're going for

380
00:18:48,781 --> 00:18:50,162
comes across more effectively.

381
00:18:50,693 --> 00:18:54,694
But there's also the other elements of stylization we talked about, one of which was proportion.

382
00:18:55,434 --> 00:19:01,856
Big things, like weird proportions, big heads, big eyes, make things feel a lot more cute

383
00:19:01,896 --> 00:19:02,476
very quickly.

384
00:19:02,776 --> 00:19:04,956
So we shake down the head, more creepy.

385
00:19:05,237 --> 00:19:07,357
And we can also shrink down the eyes once again.

386
00:19:08,017 --> 00:19:13,978
So you have your green guy, who's not the creepiest he could be, and then you desaturate

387
00:19:14,018 --> 00:19:16,879
him of just his proportions, and he gets a lot creepier very fast.

388
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:18,479
Less cute.

389
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,160
All right.

390
00:19:21,014 --> 00:19:27,637
So there is a lot going on here and that's pretty typical for game visuals. Like you're trying to

391
00:19:27,677 --> 00:19:30,638
get a bunch of stuff in, maybe it's not as cohesive as you planned, maybe you didn't make

392
00:19:30,678 --> 00:19:35,841
a plan from the beginning, and you're kind of overwhelmed. So the thing to do, I think, first is

393
00:19:36,461 --> 00:19:39,403
take away the gameplay aspect and focus on your backgrounds.

394
00:19:39,923 --> 00:19:42,485
Just like before, this is a very high density background.

395
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:44,622
with a lot of value contrast.

396
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:47,103
If we lower the value contrast,

397
00:19:47,663 --> 00:19:50,524
you can immediately put more stuff in the foreground

398
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,384
that will pop out more.

399
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:52,764
You can see this with the spider web,

400
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,745
but the spider web also doesn't need

401
00:19:54,785 --> 00:19:56,306
to be a high contrast item.

402
00:19:56,726 --> 00:19:57,926
It informs the gameplay

403
00:19:58,066 --> 00:19:59,927
and it's an interesting storytelling element,

404
00:20:00,347 --> 00:20:02,347
but it's not important to the gameplay.

405
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,648
So you can reduce that as well.

406
00:20:05,348 --> 00:20:07,149
And now when you put things back on the screen,

407
00:20:07,229 --> 00:20:08,809
it's a lot easier to see what's going on

408
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,470
and understand what's happening.

409
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:12,510
So...

410
00:20:13,194 --> 00:20:17,057
Now that we've resolved the background problems, let's look at the characters.

411
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:21,339
There's actually a lot of good stuff happening with some of the characters in this. Each of the

412
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:27,643
butterflies has a unique pattern and a unique color, so no matter what color impairment you

413
00:20:27,663 --> 00:20:31,665
might have, you can still tell based on the pattern that they're different, and they have

414
00:20:31,726 --> 00:20:38,410
hue separation for each player to recognize them as well. But now that we've adjusted the background

415
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,471
to more of a medium tone,

416
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,311
the spider is a lot harder to see and pick out.

417
00:20:43,711 --> 00:20:46,172
So we want to do a value adjustment on that spider

418
00:20:46,192 --> 00:20:47,392
so that it pops out.

419
00:20:47,793 --> 00:20:51,934
Make it darker, you can see it a lot better.

420
00:20:52,114 --> 00:20:53,854
And we also made the eyes a different hue.

421
00:20:53,954 --> 00:20:56,855
The hue contrast between the spider's eyes

422
00:20:56,895 --> 00:20:58,256
and the environment is now greater,

423
00:20:58,276 --> 00:20:59,136
so you can pick that out.

424
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,497
And in games that are static,

425
00:21:02,777 --> 00:21:03,898
where you have static elements,

426
00:21:03,938 --> 00:21:05,438
you can also do something like put a light

427
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:07,199
in the background to increase the contrast.

428
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:08,139
It's harder to do.

429
00:21:08,753 --> 00:21:11,114
in open world games, but if you have a 2D game,

430
00:21:11,134 --> 00:21:12,234
it's something that you can use.

431
00:21:12,254 --> 00:21:16,456
All right, so if we bring back our bullets,

432
00:21:17,616 --> 00:21:19,597
like I said earlier, bullet hells have a sort of

433
00:21:19,657 --> 00:21:20,957
inherent density challenge.

434
00:21:21,778 --> 00:21:24,019
So we need to do what we can to make it clearer.

435
00:21:25,739 --> 00:21:28,981
So these bullets have a delineation strategy

436
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,901
that's super common in the memes the kids do,

437
00:21:31,281 --> 00:21:34,603
which is you have a white object in a black outline

438
00:21:34,663 --> 00:21:35,523
or a dark outline.

439
00:21:35,623 --> 00:21:36,663
It's purple in this case.

440
00:21:37,112 --> 00:21:39,392
But now that we've changed the values of the image,

441
00:21:39,412 --> 00:21:42,053
now we have darker values.

442
00:21:42,693 --> 00:21:45,074
We don't need a dark value around a white object

443
00:21:45,114 --> 00:21:47,014
because the white object is already brightest.

444
00:21:47,235 --> 00:21:49,255
And it confuses things like the hitbox

445
00:21:49,435 --> 00:21:52,636
and where things would land if you were playing.

446
00:21:53,176 --> 00:21:54,637
So it's better to make things bright.

447
00:21:55,097 --> 00:21:57,958
You can see where the bounds of the bullets are a lot easier

448
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,338
and figure out what's going on more easily.

449
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:02,899
And you can have a color association

450
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:05,560
between the bullets that the boss produces

451
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,680
and the boss itself.

452
00:22:08,303 --> 00:22:14,605
If we go to the player bullets, it's a lot easier to delineate the bullets from each other now already,

453
00:22:14,745 --> 00:22:18,126
because the yellow is very different from what they are looking like.

454
00:22:18,406 --> 00:22:20,967
But we'd like to give the player as much information as we can,

455
00:22:21,387 --> 00:22:23,728
so why don't we color the bullets to match the player?

456
00:22:24,868 --> 00:22:28,470
More information is always good. We want the players to know what's going on.

457
00:22:29,312 --> 00:22:33,274
And then we want to delineate the bullets differently

458
00:22:33,434 --> 00:22:35,354
between the players and the boss even more.

459
00:22:35,835 --> 00:22:38,235
And you can do shape for that, just like I talked about

460
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:39,636
when I talked about color blindness.

461
00:22:39,956 --> 00:22:43,097
But you might want to reserve unique shapes

462
00:22:43,297 --> 00:22:45,778
for special weapons or power-ups.

463
00:22:45,838 --> 00:22:49,119
So you can just use size to tell the player

464
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:51,560
that a bullet is friendly or an enemy.

465
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,161
If it's a small bullet, it's a friendly bullet.

466
00:22:54,057 --> 00:22:56,659
and that makes it a lot easier to see what's going on.

467
00:22:56,879 --> 00:22:58,080
There's less visual density,

468
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,382
there's more open space between things,

469
00:23:00,542 --> 00:23:02,964
and you can figure out what's happening a lot more easily.

470
00:23:03,665 --> 00:23:05,226
So this is what it looked like before,

471
00:23:06,187 --> 00:23:07,468
and this is what it looks like now.

472
00:23:08,489 --> 00:23:12,452
So we talked about critique, how we do it instinctively,

473
00:23:12,572 --> 00:23:17,195
and a good way to think about it for actual game development.

474
00:23:17,315 --> 00:23:19,377
We talked about color and composition and style,

475
00:23:19,677 --> 00:23:21,819
and how those affect our game visuals.

476
00:23:22,395 --> 00:23:24,897
And we applied it, so hopefully you can now apply these

477
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:27,439
to your own game visuals, but every game is different.

478
00:23:27,619 --> 00:23:30,522
These solutions that I've used are optional solutions.

479
00:23:30,562 --> 00:23:32,443
You can use a lot of different strategies

480
00:23:32,463 --> 00:23:33,785
with the elements I've talked about

481
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:37,888
to solve gameplay problems and solve your goals

482
00:23:38,409 --> 00:23:42,252
for your games and figure out what suits your game best.

483
00:23:43,433 --> 00:23:44,414
Thank you, I'm Allie.

484
00:23:44,434 --> 00:23:45,314
You can.

485
00:23:53,245 --> 00:23:53,766
Thank you, Ali.

486
00:23:53,806 --> 00:23:54,826
If you have a question for Ali,

487
00:23:54,846 --> 00:23:57,207
please come to the mic in the middle of the aisle there.

488
00:23:58,828 --> 00:24:00,368
I will get things started myself.

489
00:24:00,408 --> 00:24:03,210
This is awesome stuff and a lot of info.

490
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,530
How do you communicate this stuff

491
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,732
when you're working with other, you know, within teams?

492
00:24:09,092 --> 00:24:09,973
If someone gives you that,

493
00:24:10,173 --> 00:24:11,613
it's too blue or something like that,

494
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:15,615
do you give them a whole, you know, half an hour type talk

495
00:24:15,655 --> 00:24:18,336
or you just give them a small piece of this?

496
00:24:18,796 --> 00:24:20,117
Well, I'm hoping I can just link them

497
00:24:20,137 --> 00:24:21,117
to my talk in the future.

498
00:24:22,543 --> 00:24:25,324
But usually you try to ask questions back.

499
00:24:25,424 --> 00:24:27,985
So if somebody is like, it's too blue, you just ask, do you

500
00:24:28,025 --> 00:24:29,166
mean it's too saturated?

501
00:24:29,206 --> 00:24:31,426
Do you mean you want it to be a different color?

502
00:24:32,267 --> 00:24:35,168
Just try to use the knowledge that you have to ask them and

503
00:24:35,188 --> 00:24:36,508
lead them to the correct solution.

504
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,050
Any questions?

505
00:24:50,745 --> 00:24:51,806
Hi, thank you for the great talk.

506
00:24:52,146 --> 00:24:52,687
Thank you.

507
00:24:53,447 --> 00:24:56,230
So I definitely paid attention to the Owl My Eyes slide

508
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,032
because I'm working on a very colorful platformer,

509
00:24:58,212 --> 00:25:00,554
and I probably am gonna hurt some people's eyes.

510
00:25:00,634 --> 00:25:02,135
So that was great, I need to think about that.

511
00:25:02,636 --> 00:25:04,017
How would you think about styles,

512
00:25:04,097 --> 00:25:05,899
very colorful, bright, saturated styles

513
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:07,300
that like Nintendo uses?

514
00:25:07,821 --> 00:25:10,523
What kind of tools might they use

515
00:25:10,603 --> 00:25:11,805
or might think about something like that

516
00:25:11,825 --> 00:25:14,047
to be able to hit that kind of toy-like,

517
00:25:14,147 --> 00:25:16,489
fun approach without hurting people's eyes?

518
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,642
So the question is how to use bright colors successfully

519
00:25:19,722 --> 00:25:20,762
without hurting people's eyes.

520
00:25:21,263 --> 00:25:25,325
Well, basically you are more aware of saturation.

521
00:25:26,105 --> 00:25:28,567
As vivid as those sorts of games tend to seem,

522
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:31,288
they have various levels of saturation

523
00:25:31,308 --> 00:25:33,069
that makes the colors more compatible.

524
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:36,811
You might have a red and a green on screen together as well,

525
00:25:36,851 --> 00:25:39,273
but you won't put them on the same character

526
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:41,054
and that makes it a lot safer.

527
00:25:41,174 --> 00:25:42,635
So you use the sort of density.

528
00:25:43,546 --> 00:25:47,009
and minimalist space separation between elements.

529
00:25:47,469 --> 00:25:49,711
So that if you have the highest of contrast colors,

530
00:25:49,751 --> 00:25:51,092
they're not next to each other.

531
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:55,256
Like Mario is red and blue and Luigi is green and blue,

532
00:25:55,656 --> 00:25:57,858
but neither of them are green and red,

533
00:25:57,918 --> 00:26:01,921
which are the most hue and color saturation contrasts

534
00:26:01,941 --> 00:26:02,621
that you could have.

535
00:26:05,524 --> 00:26:05,664
Hi.

536
00:26:08,249 --> 00:26:11,591
Have you ever dealt with highly complex machine models?

537
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:12,471
Like how would you...

538
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:16,592
So I work in a company that has very small team,

539
00:26:16,652 --> 00:26:18,013
but we do very complex objects.

540
00:26:18,473 --> 00:26:20,494
So have you ever had to deal with stuff like,

541
00:26:20,614 --> 00:26:22,955
say a car, like taking apart or breaking it down?

542
00:26:22,995 --> 00:26:24,035
Like they are very realistic,

543
00:26:24,055 --> 00:26:26,716
but how would you kind of manage the styling of that?

544
00:26:27,916 --> 00:26:28,296
In what way?

545
00:26:30,227 --> 00:26:32,948
It's tough because we have to maintain product integrity,

546
00:26:33,028 --> 00:26:34,309
but then we also have to do artistic.

547
00:26:34,349 --> 00:26:36,110
I don't know if you guys have ever had to deal with that,

548
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,531
with like, hey, make this thing look cool,

549
00:26:38,551 --> 00:26:39,571
but not too realistic.

550
00:26:39,611 --> 00:26:41,772
Sorry, I just didn't know that's a vague question.

551
00:26:42,813 --> 00:26:46,654
So you're asking how you can make detailed machine models

552
00:26:46,835 --> 00:26:49,036
look stylized in an interesting way?

553
00:26:49,296 --> 00:26:49,496
Yeah.

554
00:26:50,076 --> 00:26:52,517
Well, it depends on what elements you're allowed to play

555
00:26:52,557 --> 00:26:53,638
with based on your thing.

556
00:26:54,098 --> 00:26:56,739
I'm working on a game where I make a lot of weird planes.

557
00:26:58,229 --> 00:27:00,371
But they're not anywhere in the realm of realistic.

558
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:01,852
We just do a bunch of strange shapes

559
00:27:02,092 --> 00:27:04,554
and play with color palettes to make them stick out

560
00:27:04,574 --> 00:27:05,334
in unique ways.

561
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:10,618
So it depends on which parts of your game or visuals

562
00:27:10,678 --> 00:27:11,699
you're allowed to play with.

563
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:14,521
If you can stylize your color, it's

564
00:27:14,581 --> 00:27:16,323
always a really fun way to work with stuff

565
00:27:16,363 --> 00:27:17,443
and make things more interesting.

566
00:27:18,344 --> 00:27:20,666
OK, I actually have, I guess, a more specific question.

567
00:27:20,686 --> 00:27:24,889
Have you ever had to deal with conflict with preference

568
00:27:24,949 --> 00:27:25,930
over certain color palettes?

569
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:27,651
That's very common.

570
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:30,533
Color palettes are super opinion-based.

571
00:27:31,093 --> 00:27:33,074
That's the sort of thing where you play test it

572
00:27:33,134 --> 00:27:34,274
and see where it's effective.

573
00:27:34,755 --> 00:27:37,136
Because no matter what situation you're in,

574
00:27:37,176 --> 00:27:38,797
there are always people with different opinions.

575
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:40,918
And you think about your target audience

576
00:27:41,098 --> 00:27:43,119
and what they are most likely to want to see.

577
00:27:43,139 --> 00:27:45,300
Okay, thank you.

578
00:27:48,101 --> 00:27:48,341
Thanks.

579
00:27:49,982 --> 00:27:50,562
All right, I think that's.

580
00:27:53,053 --> 00:27:54,076
That's going to wrap things up.

581
00:27:54,156 --> 00:27:57,064
Please make sure you fill out your email surveys

582
00:27:57,205 --> 00:27:59,170

583
00:27:59,210 --> 00:27:59,912
Thank you so much, Ali.
