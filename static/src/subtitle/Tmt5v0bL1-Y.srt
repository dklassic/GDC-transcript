00:00:04,959 --> 00:00:07,320
Good afternoon, UX Summit.

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,762
This is my first GDC talk, so whether you

3
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:14,283
think it was terrible or decent, please fill out your forms.

4
00:00:14,343 --> 00:00:15,584
We want your feedback.

5
00:00:16,304 --> 00:00:17,885
Also mute your phones, please.

6
00:00:18,925 --> 00:00:20,546
My name is Marie Jassmin.

7
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:25,248
I've been in game UI design for 10 years now.

8
00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:31,991
And last year, I joined a team at Bethesda Game Studios

9
00:00:32,191 --> 00:00:34,112
with an interesting mandate.

10
00:00:35,647 --> 00:00:41,630
to create an Elder Scrolls experience on your phone.

11
00:00:44,171 --> 00:00:46,972
The vision for the Elder Scrolls Blades

12
00:00:47,052 --> 00:00:51,975
was to create intricate role-playing game systems

13
00:00:52,555 --> 00:00:54,876
with depth set in environments

14
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:57,457
that would push the edge of visual quality

15
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:59,218
on the small devices,

16
00:01:00,499 --> 00:01:03,760
while fully embracing portability

17
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:13,699
and accessibility. Now it may not be apparent at a glance, but this vision for Blades contains a

18
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:23,268
dilemma. Should the game be built in the portrait mode or in the landscape mode?

19
00:01:25,951 --> 00:01:27,913
Blades ended up being built for both.

20
00:01:29,066 --> 00:01:35,147
And today we'll dig a little deeper into the vision that led us to choose dual orientation support.

21
00:01:36,447 --> 00:01:41,148
Then we'll look at the UI design process and how we made it happen.

22
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:47,070
And finally we'll analyze the player response we have so far,

23
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,110
considering we're still in early access, closed beta actually.

24
00:01:54,351 --> 00:01:56,711
But it's still interesting to look at today.

25
00:01:58,071 --> 00:02:02,274
So we're building an Elder Scrolls game on mobile.

26
00:02:04,235 --> 00:02:09,959
In essence, mobile gaming liberates the context of play

27
00:02:10,779 --> 00:02:14,562
away from the living room or home PC

28
00:02:15,242 --> 00:02:19,985
and takes it anywhere, on the couch, at the park.

29
00:02:21,372 --> 00:02:24,694
on the bus, at the airport, on the toilet,

30
00:02:25,674 --> 00:02:29,617
or during a meeting, or a GDC talk.

31
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:32,639
Notice a few things here.

32
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,921
In some of these contexts,

33
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,343
people only have one free hat.

34
00:02:40,183 --> 00:02:44,066
So if gaming is to be made even possible there,

35
00:02:44,966 --> 00:02:45,987
portrait is a must.

36
00:02:47,826 --> 00:02:54,514
In fact, for some players, the one-hand situation is a little more persistent.

37
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:00,221
For others, it might be even permanent.

38
00:03:01,802 --> 00:03:07,609
In other contexts, the public eye is upon our player.

39
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,664
And in those situations, portraits can act as some sort of a stealth mode,

40
00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:19,029
where people may not necessarily appear to be playing a game.

41
00:03:19,929 --> 00:03:24,334
Our creative director Todd Howard affectionately calls portrait mode

42
00:03:24,894 --> 00:03:26,035
the meeting mode.

43
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:32,201
So looking at the context of play, we must conclude that if mobility is a

44
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:32,942
requirement,

45
00:03:34,042 --> 00:03:38,168
then portrait orientation is the only way to go.

46
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:42,454
However, remember that for blades,

47
00:03:43,395 --> 00:03:47,881
navigation in stunning environments is also a must.

48
00:03:50,202 --> 00:03:56,644
External research done on the way we hold our devices reveals that while portrait holds

49
00:03:56,804 --> 00:04:03,145
are relatively diverse, a lot of people hold their device with both hands or just one hand

50
00:04:03,205 --> 00:04:08,086
depending on context, but the landscape hold is almost universal.

51
00:04:08,686 --> 00:04:14,348
People have both thumbs firmly placed on each side of the screen towards the bottom.

52
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:23,086
The physiognomy of people, or the ergonomy of the landscape hold, enables us to separate

53
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:33,394
controls for camera and navigation in two. So, yeah, the alternative in portrait is the one

54
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:40,340
finger tap to move, but this inevitably binds camera to the eyes, effectively reproducing

55
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,103
the feeling of walking with a very stiff neck.

56
00:04:47,017 --> 00:04:51,139
And perhaps more importantly, navigation options for humans,

57
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,760
and Khajiit, and Oregonians alike,

58
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,400
if you're familiar with the Yellow Scrolls,

59
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,181
are usually lateral.

60
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:01,242
Above is mostly ceiling and sky.

61
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:04,583
Below is mostly ground and floor.

62
00:05:04,743 --> 00:05:06,844
Not very interesting for navigation

63
00:05:06,904 --> 00:05:09,765
if you're a regular human, not Spider-Man.

64
00:05:10,983 --> 00:05:15,206
As a result, so in this example, you see two doors, right?

65
00:05:15,226 --> 00:05:17,067
So you could go left, you could go right,

66
00:05:17,588 --> 00:05:19,589
you have choices, you have agency.

67
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,453
But when viewing the same environment in portrait,

68
00:05:25,374 --> 00:05:26,614
you can only see one door.

69
00:05:27,415 --> 00:05:29,517
So effectively what happens is that

70
00:05:30,017 --> 00:05:33,239
your navigation options are hidden under the fold

71
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,581
to borrow a term from web design.

72
00:05:36,382 --> 00:05:39,104
So basically what it means is you need to scroll.

73
00:05:40,305 --> 00:05:42,166
to be able to see your options.

74
00:05:43,287 --> 00:05:46,629
And this, combined with the stiff neck phenomenon,

75
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:50,331
creates feelings of claustrophobia

76
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:54,033
when navigating a 3D environment in portrait.

77
00:05:55,093 --> 00:05:58,075
Hence, we come to the groundbreaking revelation

78
00:05:58,115 --> 00:06:00,516
of this day at GDC.

79
00:06:02,077 --> 00:06:05,379
Landscapes are better experienced in landscape.

80
00:06:09,468 --> 00:06:11,509
So let's do a little experiment.

81
00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:17,391
If you personally had to choose a device orientation

82
00:06:17,471 --> 00:06:19,512
to build the Elder Scrolls Blades,

83
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:21,972
which one would you go for?

84
00:06:22,913 --> 00:06:26,894
Those who vote for the portrait mode with better accessibility

85
00:06:27,094 --> 00:06:30,335
and mobility, raise your hands.

86
00:06:31,856 --> 00:06:32,916
Ooh, a few people.

87
00:06:33,596 --> 00:06:36,197
And those who choose the more immersive.

88
00:06:37,687 --> 00:06:44,890
mode. Oh, wow, that's interesting. A lot of immersive people here. Actually, this was an

89
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:54,234
endless debate at Bethesda, so we took the opportunity here to turn lack of consensus into

90
00:06:55,754 --> 00:07:02,157
an opportunity for player agency, so we let people flip their phones whenever they please.

91
00:07:03,886 --> 00:07:09,490
And yes, we knew it would be expensive and painful and we had never done this before.

92
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,511
What are we waiting for?

93
00:07:11,591 --> 00:07:12,251
Let's get started!

94
00:07:14,178 --> 00:07:18,182
To begin with, we make design documents and menu flows,

95
00:07:18,802 --> 00:07:21,365
and we make only one set of them.

96
00:07:21,985 --> 00:07:26,890
So to preserve our sanity, we go through the regular design

97
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:31,274
process, but trying to keep the information presented

98
00:07:31,294 --> 00:07:35,558
to the players the exact same as much as possible,

99
00:07:35,618 --> 00:07:38,641
just in two different layouts, so a bit like mirror layouts.

100
00:07:40,564 --> 00:07:48,454
So what this means is that the UX or design team had minimal overhead for dual orientation support,

101
00:07:48,494 --> 00:07:52,759
but the UI team needs to produce each mock-up or wireframe twice.

102
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:59,536
On Blades, this added about 20 to 60% time to UI conception.

103
00:07:59,616 --> 00:08:01,739
It doesn't double the time

104
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:04,081
because most visual communication problems

105
00:08:04,161 --> 00:08:07,405
have already been solved when you tackle the alternate mode.

106
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:11,869
But the extra time invested in conception

107
00:08:12,931 --> 00:08:15,313
did yield some early benefits.

108
00:08:19,619 --> 00:08:24,884
To provide an example, this is one of the earliest building menus.

109
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:32,344
we designed, and here I list all the materials people need to craft certain buildings, being

110
00:08:32,404 --> 00:08:38,308
as generous with information as I can so that players can make their own crafting decisions.

111
00:08:39,048 --> 00:08:44,091
And paper tests were relatively successful, so if I ask, can you craft a smithy, people

112
00:08:44,151 --> 00:08:51,856
would say, um, no, because I'm missing lumber and potatoes.

113
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:55,018
Relatively successful.

114
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:59,171
But then came the time to adapt the layout to portrait,

115
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:04,356
and while our list now nicely held a large number of items,

116
00:09:05,297 --> 00:09:07,719
and this was nice, we wanted to keep it this way,

117
00:09:07,819 --> 00:09:11,002
but there was no way all the information

118
00:09:11,062 --> 00:09:13,444
would ever fit the narrow space.

119
00:09:15,005 --> 00:09:16,787
So it forced us to adapt, right?

120
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:22,091
So we started disclosing information depending on context,

121
00:09:22,924 --> 00:09:27,226
So here in the repair section at the smithy I show the item condition

122
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:35,451
and in the crafting section I show information about the materials required

123
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:42,436
but notice here that the materials information has been distilled to a red X or green check mark.

124
00:09:44,118 --> 00:09:48,000
And when we paper tested this again, the distilled version in portrait,

125
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,301
the responses were noticeably more confident.

126
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,862
So can you craft a steel dagger?

127
00:09:53,382 --> 00:09:54,622
Sure, but it's not worth it.

128
00:09:55,023 --> 00:09:55,943
It has bad stats.

129
00:09:56,743 --> 00:09:57,944
So it was way better.

130
00:09:57,984 --> 00:10:01,385
So we realized that the compromises we had made for portrait

131
00:10:01,945 --> 00:10:03,706
were actually way more efficient.

132
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:07,287
So we adopted them for landscape as well.

133
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,168
The takeaway here.

134
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,906
is that the extra constraints on the UI team

135
00:10:14,626 --> 00:10:18,048
allowed Blades to identify certain issues early on,

136
00:10:18,748 --> 00:10:22,290
and it saved us a lot of time down the line.

137
00:10:23,511 --> 00:10:26,753
Thank heavens it did, because down the line

138
00:10:26,873 --> 00:10:30,435
is where time became excessively scarce.

139
00:10:32,436 --> 00:10:34,577
The implementation was time-consuming.

140
00:10:38,328 --> 00:10:42,893
First, dual orientation still means each of the two layouts

141
00:10:42,953 --> 00:10:46,496
need to adapt to the various aspect ratios, notches,

142
00:10:46,596 --> 00:10:49,218
and punch holes of the mobile market today.

143
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:53,782
So even if all our documents were produced in a 16 by 9

144
00:10:54,203 --> 00:10:58,386
aspect ratio, they need to stretch vertically on iPads

145
00:10:58,507 --> 00:11:02,790
and horizontally on larger, newer phones.

146
00:11:04,194 --> 00:11:10,638
So our integration nodes got quite complex and our prefabs in Unity got even more so.

147
00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:17,722
But the real dual orientation party happened in quality assurance.

148
00:11:18,662 --> 00:11:26,447
Because remember that players not only own differently shaped and sizes of devices, they

149
00:11:26,547 --> 00:11:31,449
are also free to rotate them whenever they damn well please.

150
00:11:32,935 --> 00:11:39,801
So QA, to test this, needed to flip their phones in every possible game situation.

151
00:11:40,401 --> 00:11:45,005
In the middle of a combat move, during a loading, during a server call, during animations,

152
00:11:45,546 --> 00:11:52,652
between a button press and a button release. Yeah. Bug festival ensued.

153
00:11:52,672 --> 00:11:59,058
In this instance, the UI disappeared entirely.

154
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:09,223
We fixed it, but fixing a dual in dual orientation is a tedious and delicate affair.

155
00:12:10,284 --> 00:12:16,287
Our systems were sometimes redundant. It was the case of our animation system,

156
00:12:16,307 --> 00:12:21,030
so keyframes are basically copy-pasted. That meant we needed to fix issues twice.

157
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:32,411
And most of the times they were instantiated, so the same widget would be used in both orientations,

158
00:12:32,511 --> 00:12:40,414
but that was delicate because it means fixing a bug in one mode might break it in the other mode.

159
00:12:41,835 --> 00:12:44,216
We did get the interface to work though and

160
00:12:45,535 --> 00:12:49,777
We got a first playable demo in the hands of players

161
00:12:50,377 --> 00:12:53,178
in dual orientation as early as we could.

162
00:12:54,118 --> 00:12:57,199
Getting the game in human hands as early as possible

163
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,041
was crucial to the dev process of Blades.

164
00:13:01,721 --> 00:13:05,902
Don't try to retrofit dual orientation.

165
00:13:06,322 --> 00:13:07,703
Do it from the start.

166
00:13:08,483 --> 00:13:10,844
You will uncover flaws in your designs

167
00:13:10,984 --> 00:13:13,725
and you need to have enough time ahead of you

168
00:13:13,785 --> 00:13:14,725
to course correct.

169
00:13:15,946 --> 00:13:22,653
To provide an example, here we have a shield icon smack in the middle of the screen

170
00:13:23,494 --> 00:13:30,260
in landscape and it's a critical combat mechanic allowing players to protect themselves with their

171
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:30,721
shield.

172
00:13:32,495 --> 00:13:38,918
The icon was terribly positioned, and my punishment as a designer for not having noticed earlier

173
00:13:38,978 --> 00:13:45,181
was to be forced to stand completely silent as I watched players struggle physically to

174
00:13:45,301 --> 00:13:47,582
even reach it, and die.

175
00:13:49,783 --> 00:13:52,684
One of the many ways I've killed people with UI.

176
00:13:57,395 --> 00:14:01,559
We fixed it, of course, we moved the shield and we added a few player options in the process

177
00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:05,602
so the left-handed could enjoy the game as much as anyone else.

178
00:14:07,484 --> 00:14:12,888
But our first hands-on demo also opened our minds to an opportunity we had overlooked.

179
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:19,234
With the two different screen modes, we could cater to different play styles.

180
00:14:20,186 --> 00:14:28,614
So as a design experiment, we began optimizing the landscape mode for immersion, allocating a good

181
00:14:28,754 --> 00:14:36,862
portion of the screen real estate to 3D models, the player's avatar, etc. And in the portrait mode,

182
00:14:36,902 --> 00:14:43,168
we got rid of all that. It became our gameplay first mode. We even cluttered the portrait

183
00:14:44,429 --> 00:14:45,730
mode 3D model with

184
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:54,071
extra non-essential information that was nonetheless useful. This is a worst-case scenario by the way,

185
00:14:54,131 --> 00:15:00,916
but the takeaway here is that the diverging layouts allowed us to be a lot bolder with

186
00:15:00,996 --> 00:15:08,621
our design decisions since we were catering to a bit narrower subset of our players for each mode.

187
00:15:14,815 --> 00:15:21,999
While it is still early to draw any conclusions as to whether this grand dual orientation

188
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:28,964
experiment was all worth it, the results we have so far are interesting.

189
00:15:31,102 --> 00:15:34,864
First, if we take a look at the freeform comment

190
00:15:34,944 --> 00:15:37,126
our closed beta players are sending us

191
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,187
through a generic feedback email,

192
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:42,449
so we give them a pop-up,

193
00:15:42,489 --> 00:15:43,789
thank you for playing Blades,

194
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:46,311
send your feedback here, and they do.

195
00:15:47,331 --> 00:15:50,953
And we witness something unprecedented in UI.

196
00:15:52,254 --> 00:15:57,777
Apart from bugs, the majority of UI mentions are positive?

197
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:02,913
From my past experience, what typically happens is,

198
00:16:03,493 --> 00:16:07,074
in freeform comment, is that UI doesn't even get noticed.

199
00:16:07,994 --> 00:16:12,495
Or it gets noticed, but that's when people tell

200
00:16:12,535 --> 00:16:15,336
the developer what's wrong with it and how to fix it.

201
00:16:17,656 --> 00:16:20,677
What's interesting, though, is that landscape mode

202
00:16:21,117 --> 00:16:22,357
gets the usual treatment.

203
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:24,078
People don't mention it.

204
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:27,941
It's the portrait mode that gets all the love.

205
00:16:28,801 --> 00:16:32,523
Our players seem to perceive it as some sort of a bonus mode

206
00:16:32,563 --> 00:16:34,944
that we've generously built for them,

207
00:16:35,785 --> 00:16:38,606
and landscape appears to be considered default

208
00:16:40,007 --> 00:16:41,588
or taken for granted.

209
00:16:42,788 --> 00:16:44,909
Dinging a little further into our letters

210
00:16:45,049 --> 00:16:47,451
of portrait mode appreciation,

211
00:16:48,427 --> 00:16:53,269
we realized that the design assumptions we made about people with different play styles,

212
00:16:53,609 --> 00:17:00,771
choosing a mode or the other to best suit them, were partly wrong. So we do have some players who

213
00:17:01,632 --> 00:17:08,895
stick to one mode, but quite a few of our playtesters have gone to great lengths to describe

214
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:15,437
their use of the portrait mode, and it's all about the context of play.

215
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:23,813
So, more like what I talked about earlier, some of the associated keywords in the feedback

216
00:17:23,853 --> 00:17:31,838
associated to portrait are going and walking. I know, walking. Don't play video games while

217
00:17:31,898 --> 00:17:40,464
walking, people. And telemetry data sort of confirms this. For instance, and take this

218
00:17:40,504 --> 00:17:42,605
with a grain of salt, we're still in closed beta.

219
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:49,036
But we clearly see, though, that the session length on average is much shorter in portraits,

220
00:17:49,056 --> 00:17:56,520
so people play less long, and overall it's slightly shorter in the daytime when people

221
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:04,424
are going about their daily business versus longer sessions in landscape, mostly past 8pm local time.

222
00:18:07,354 --> 00:18:14,478
Another curious finding from digging into device orientation telemetry data is the gradual adoption,

223
00:18:14,818 --> 00:18:22,122
slow but gradual adoption of the landscape mode by the same players over time. So it's as if our

224
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:27,785
players kind of naturally realize that the experience is a bit better in landscape and

225
00:18:27,805 --> 00:18:32,627
they kind of adopt it. However, the adoption is not

226
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:42,804
global. People play the quests, dungeons, more in landscape over time, but in menus it remains

227
00:18:42,824 --> 00:18:47,647
around 65% portrait, 45% landscape, kind of consistently over time.

228
00:18:54,378 --> 00:19:05,724
So globally, the trend we're observing is that many of our players will tend to go about their daily business in their town in short daytime sessions in portraits.

229
00:19:05,784 --> 00:19:19,130
So they'll go get their gear repaired, temper a sword, brew a few potions, and then they'll come back later to the game in the evening for longer sessions to explore.

230
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:24,951
dungeons, fight dragons, or explore the abyss outside of town.

231
00:19:26,492 --> 00:19:31,993
So in a way, dual-screen orientation support has positioned The Elder Scrolls Blades

232
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,253
in the best of both worlds.

233
00:19:34,313 --> 00:19:37,654
It remains portable and accessible throughout the day,

234
00:19:38,234 --> 00:19:44,735
while making no concessions on the stunning RPG experience it provides.

235
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:51,693
The grand takeaway here is that if well planned,

236
00:19:53,154 --> 00:19:55,577
and I need to insist on this, if well planned

237
00:19:55,657 --> 00:19:58,239
and if done from the beginning, both technically

238
00:19:58,399 --> 00:20:01,982
and production-wise, the return on investment

239
00:20:02,303 --> 00:20:09,529
of portioned mode support on a 3D mobile experience

240
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,312
is well worth the extra costs.

241
00:20:14,951 --> 00:20:17,672
The extra design constraints actually

242
00:20:17,732 --> 00:20:19,173
help improve the experience.

243
00:20:19,433 --> 00:20:23,115
And our data shows our players appreciate it,

244
00:20:23,215 --> 00:20:25,437
and they use it when it suits them.

245
00:20:28,278 --> 00:20:30,380
If you'd like to try it for yourselves,

246
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,301
you can download the game.

247
00:20:32,461 --> 00:20:36,463
It will be available this spring to all.

248
00:20:36,483 --> 00:20:37,584
It's free.

249
00:20:37,664 --> 00:20:40,786
Give it a run and send us your feedback.

250
00:20:42,895 --> 00:20:45,317
This is a feedback address if you want to follow me,

251
00:20:45,397 --> 00:20:46,618
I rant about UI.

252
00:20:47,439 --> 00:20:50,702
And if you witness your colleagues playing Blades

253
00:20:50,742 --> 00:20:53,264
in meetings, share your stories, I want to hear them.

254
00:20:54,285 --> 00:20:54,785
Thank you.

255
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,857
We do have a bit of time for questions.

256
00:21:23,806 --> 00:21:31,911
About how many, I guess, iterations did you go through for the UI when you started to realize,

257
00:21:32,011 --> 00:21:38,495
hey, we can kind of put these things together, like we can use check marks instead of red numbers, etc.

258
00:21:40,953 --> 00:21:43,935
So it depends on which parts of the UI.

259
00:21:44,035 --> 00:21:46,817
Some were pretty good from the get-go.

260
00:21:46,898 --> 00:21:49,399
Others were very much iterated on.

261
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,241
The game, actually, it's interesting

262
00:21:52,482 --> 00:21:54,343
because it's a smaller team than I'm used to.

263
00:21:54,423 --> 00:21:58,146
I come from AAA, and it changed radically

264
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:00,307
throughout the dev process.

265
00:22:01,148 --> 00:22:01,888
I'll share this.

266
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:03,510
One of the things we discovered

267
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,591
in our first play tests last year

268
00:22:06,111 --> 00:22:08,493
was that people were obsessed with cheese.

269
00:22:09,093 --> 00:22:11,515
And we were like, oh my god, cheese is one of the Elder

270
00:22:11,535 --> 00:22:12,836
Scrolls core pillars.

271
00:22:12,936 --> 00:22:16,059
And people couldn't interact with cheese.

272
00:22:16,099 --> 00:22:17,080
They were really sad.

273
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,181
So we added cheese.

274
00:22:18,281 --> 00:22:21,564
And now you can eat cheese in the Elder Scrolls blade.

275
00:22:22,024 --> 00:22:25,607
But yeah, some parts got actually really, really

276
00:22:25,687 --> 00:22:26,768
changed radically.

277
00:22:27,649 --> 00:22:29,110
It depends on the UI.

278
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:31,732
Crafting is one of the ones that changed a lot.

279
00:22:32,753 --> 00:22:33,053
Thank you.

280
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:37,679
Hello Marie-Jasmin.

281
00:22:37,719 --> 00:22:38,380
Hello Anouk.

282
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,021
Wonderful talk.

283
00:22:40,141 --> 00:22:44,805
I have a bit of a question, sort of in the theme of one of our earlier talks.

284
00:22:45,546 --> 00:22:49,910
In projects like this, one of the hardest things to do is to get buy-in.

285
00:22:50,951 --> 00:22:54,194
So when you're starting a project like this, generally speaking, you need some data to

286
00:22:54,254 --> 00:22:54,394
say,

287
00:22:54,814 --> 00:22:59,255
we can invest all of this time because this is how our players are going to feel.

288
00:22:59,315 --> 00:23:04,717
How did you tackle convincing your team and your company to be able to do this,

289
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:08,258
invest in the time to be able to do in portrait and landscape?

290
00:23:08,578 --> 00:23:10,259
That's an excellent question.

291
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:14,080
And yes, it's true, you need buy-in.

292
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,981
We were lucky because it was the other way around on our project.

293
00:23:18,641 --> 00:23:23,307
the creative director who believed in dual orientation support for blades,

294
00:23:23,427 --> 00:23:26,451
and he needed to convince us because the doers were like,

295
00:23:26,511 --> 00:23:28,633
but it's going to cost this much money.

296
00:23:29,114 --> 00:23:31,397
And he convinced us. Amazing.

297
00:23:31,897 --> 00:23:34,220
But that's easier than the other way around. Yes.

298
00:23:36,522 --> 00:23:36,662
Hi.

299
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,785
So when you have your phone, normally it's in portrait,

300
00:23:39,825 --> 00:23:41,306
like that's how all the apps are displayed.

301
00:23:41,366 --> 00:23:41,606
Yes.

302
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,948
When you boot up the app and you have the splash screen,

303
00:23:44,968 --> 00:23:46,770
that usually sets the precedent for whether they want

304
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,951
you to turn your phone or not.

305
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:51,233
How did you make the decision to make whatever the default,

306
00:23:51,253 --> 00:23:52,594
whether it was portrait or landscape?

307
00:23:53,505 --> 00:23:57,068
So the default is whatever the player is booting in.

308
00:23:57,188 --> 00:24:00,250
And one of the things we're considering now

309
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:03,453
is maybe tutorializing the fact

310
00:24:03,473 --> 00:24:06,195
that you can even flip your phone.

311
00:24:06,755 --> 00:24:09,177
We have some hardcore portrait users.

312
00:24:09,217 --> 00:24:14,061
You saw like about 65% of people are in menus in portrait.

313
00:24:14,101 --> 00:24:15,882
And we think maybe it's because some people

314
00:24:15,963 --> 00:24:17,424
don't even know they can.

315
00:24:18,144 --> 00:24:25,629
flip their phone because it's not very common yet in North America. So we're considering it.

316
00:24:26,329 --> 00:24:35,855
Hi, I have a question for smaller companies with smaller budget. For instance, is it an option to

317
00:24:35,935 --> 00:24:41,839
play the game in landscape and the menu in portrait? Is this something that you already

318
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,002
have? Yes, it could be an option. Did you evaluate this approach?

319
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:48,354
Is it a valid approach?

320
00:24:49,936 --> 00:24:55,883
That's interesting, but it would force users to flip their phones at certain times.

321
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:58,826
It's what they do.

322
00:24:59,512 --> 00:25:04,194
I'm thinking, but I don't think I've ever seen this approach.

323
00:25:04,234 --> 00:25:07,175
Me neither, but it's great to do both.

324
00:25:07,615 --> 00:25:11,537
But let's say that, is it something that you analyze

325
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:13,978
doing playtest or asking players?

326
00:25:13,998 --> 00:25:17,059
No, we wanted to give full control to the players.

327
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:18,219
Yeah.

328
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,480
And don't you think that it could be an option

329
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,240
or not at all?

330
00:25:23,597 --> 00:25:25,719
I don't know, I think it might be frustrating

331
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,023
to be forced to rotate your phone

332
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:30,545
when you don't necessarily want to.

333
00:25:30,565 --> 00:25:32,988
But that's just a hunch,

334
00:25:33,288 --> 00:25:36,352
because I don't have an example of a case

335
00:25:36,412 --> 00:25:37,193
where it's been done.

336
00:25:37,213 --> 00:25:38,134
No, me neither.

337
00:25:38,795 --> 00:25:39,015
Thank you.

338
00:25:42,988 --> 00:25:48,610
Bonjour Marie. Just a quick question, because you talk about the old rotation scenario with your QA team,

339
00:25:48,871 --> 00:25:52,272
and I'm just curious, what was the process with that or with them?

340
00:25:52,312 --> 00:25:56,754
Because, I mean, it's, well, I think they might have lost their minds at some level,

341
00:25:56,794 --> 00:25:58,455
because there were so many scenarios.

342
00:25:58,775 --> 00:26:04,457
And the follow-up question on that is, how much data did you get from the QA on the UI and UX perspective?

343
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:19,557
A great question. Yes, they needed a hug at some point, but yeah, for QA it's, yeah, I said so,

344
00:26:20,938 --> 00:26:26,061
they carry basically the heaviest part of the burden because they needed to test every possible

345
00:26:26,161 --> 00:26:29,583
case. For localization it was twice, so every...

346
00:26:30,243 --> 00:26:32,784
every language needed to be tested twice,

347
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:35,826
not all the possible aspect ratios

348
00:26:35,906 --> 00:26:37,927
because you just need to test

349
00:26:37,987 --> 00:26:40,028
your smallest possible aspect ratio

350
00:26:40,128 --> 00:26:41,629
and test everything twice.

351
00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:45,391
But for, yeah, testing, flipping their phones,

352
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:46,871
and they kind of liked it though

353
00:26:46,891 --> 00:26:47,932
because they're sadistic.

354
00:26:48,412 --> 00:26:51,154
Like, I flipped my phone in the middle of this,

355
00:26:51,554 --> 00:26:53,775
yeah, button press and release was like,

356
00:26:53,975 --> 00:26:56,196
why would you do that?

357
00:26:56,216 --> 00:26:56,776
It goes QA.

358
00:27:00,898 --> 00:27:04,721
So yeah, the buy-in, again, to come back to the buy-in,

359
00:27:04,762 --> 00:27:07,604
needs to be global, right?

360
00:27:07,784 --> 00:27:10,247
The QA needs to be aware, we're doing this,

361
00:27:10,387 --> 00:27:14,471
we're in this together, and yes, they need support.

362
00:27:14,651 --> 00:27:15,051
Merci.

363
00:27:17,274 --> 00:27:17,474
Yes.

364
00:27:17,654 --> 00:27:18,795
Hi, my name's David.

365
00:27:19,536 --> 00:27:23,259
Do you have any data on whether it was harder to play in?

366
00:27:24,189 --> 00:27:27,833
Portrait, you were talking about how you sort of have a tunnel vision effect.

367
00:27:28,234 --> 00:27:29,696
Yeah, probably still get through the levels.

368
00:27:29,716 --> 00:27:31,818
Does it take longer to get through them or more tries?

369
00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:32,759
Do you know this?

370
00:27:35,022 --> 00:27:38,025
That's a very good question.

371
00:27:38,045 --> 00:27:43,872
It doesn't take longer to get through the same level, but.

372
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:50,786
Yeah, it's mostly a question of how you feel through it.

373
00:27:50,926 --> 00:27:54,707
And we know also, it's actually really hard to get any data on this,

374
00:27:54,747 --> 00:27:56,947
because people are in different contexts.

375
00:27:57,007 --> 00:27:57,908
They don't have time.

376
00:27:57,948 --> 00:27:59,708
They're kind of busy in portrait.

377
00:27:59,828 --> 00:28:02,069
Usually they want to go faster.

378
00:28:02,129 --> 00:28:04,249
I don't think you'd notice it's harder if you're playing.

379
00:28:04,369 --> 00:28:08,810
But the landscape people will explore a bit more, go to the side path,

380
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,410
discover the hidden treasure.

381
00:28:11,051 --> 00:28:14,731
So it's very different ways of playing the same game.

382
00:28:15,592 --> 00:28:18,876
Actually, unfortunately we have not a lot of data

383
00:28:18,896 --> 00:28:20,398
because we're still in closed beta,

384
00:28:20,438 --> 00:28:23,922
but that's what we observe is people are a bit more

385
00:28:23,982 --> 00:28:26,185
in a hurry and you saw the session length

386
00:28:26,285 --> 00:28:29,068
is much shorter in portrait.

387
00:28:29,789 --> 00:28:33,673
So it's just a different way to experience the same game.

388
00:28:34,975 --> 00:28:35,315
Thank you.

389
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:37,771
Hi, I had a question.

390
00:28:38,191 --> 00:28:39,992
You mentioned at the end you validated

391
00:28:40,012 --> 00:28:43,414
that there was a good return on investment in doing both,

392
00:28:43,854 --> 00:28:45,675
but I guess what were you looking at in terms of data

393
00:28:45,695 --> 00:28:46,555
to kind of validate that?

394
00:28:48,261 --> 00:28:51,283
Thank you. So was it a good return on investment?

395
00:28:51,823 --> 00:28:59,568
What we are looking right now to say that is mostly the reception of the players and also the media.

396
00:29:00,128 --> 00:29:07,112
It's interesting, I didn't put it on my slides, but we even have headlines in our reviews that are like,

397
00:29:07,232 --> 00:29:12,335
wow, Elder Scrolls Blades is getting one thing right, the portrait mode.

398
00:29:12,995 --> 00:29:16,657
And we're like, weird headline, like UI is not used to be.

399
00:29:17,858 --> 00:29:24,003
so to get so much limelight, but that's also all the good press, the people are grateful for the

400
00:29:24,063 --> 00:29:31,068
existence of the portrait mode, we think that's well worth it. It's hard to calculate isn't it,

401
00:29:31,088 --> 00:29:37,493
because we also don't know exactly how much it costed us, it's hard to evaluate because we did it

402
00:29:38,874 --> 00:29:45,339
from the get-go in both orientations, but yeah we believe it was worth it. Thank you.

403
00:29:47,266 --> 00:29:49,014
That's all the time we have.

404
00:29:49,797 --> 00:29:50,520
Thank you very much.
