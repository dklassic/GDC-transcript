1
00:00:05,893 --> 00:00:10,275
I've been lecturing a bunch around funding and pitching.

2
00:00:10,895 --> 00:00:12,695
Actually, last year I did a session

3
00:00:12,935 --> 00:00:14,616
on funding models in particular.

4
00:00:16,076 --> 00:00:18,017
And I've really tried to do a lot

5
00:00:18,037 --> 00:00:19,657
around educating developers,

6
00:00:20,197 --> 00:00:22,098
primarily on the business side of things.

7
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:25,899
We got some attention a few years ago with Execution Labs

8
00:00:25,919 --> 00:00:28,600
because we were one of the first pre-seed,

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,140
sort of early stage investors in game studios.

10
00:00:32,061 --> 00:00:37,303
We did 25 investments and it was a tremendous learning opportunity for us

11
00:00:38,043 --> 00:00:41,205
in terms of understanding the challenges of indies and startups.

12
00:00:41,965 --> 00:00:47,268
And a lot of the learnings that I tend to talk about come from that experience.

13
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:52,790
And these days I spend much more time on mentorship and advisory stuff,

14
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:57,672
consulting work with studios, but also helping regions

15
00:00:58,033 --> 00:00:59,493
and sort of upgrading the...

16
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:03,516
business knowledge and skills in regions around the world.

17
00:01:04,357 --> 00:01:07,639
One of the fun things that I'm involved with is Gameplay Space.

18
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,222
Gameplay Space was founded about four years ago

19
00:01:11,242 --> 00:01:14,444
and it was done as a kind of complementary

20
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:16,286
entity to Execution Labs.

21
00:01:16,706 --> 00:01:23,429
Execution Labs was a private fund, and so we were quite mean in that we said no to almost

22
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:24,230
everyone who pitched.

23
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:29,453
Since we were investing other people's monies, we had to be really focused on commercial

24
00:01:29,473 --> 00:01:32,074
viability and the growth potential of studios.

25
00:01:32,734 --> 00:01:38,099
We constantly got requests for mentorship and support and help and connections,

26
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:42,443
and we always had to say no because we were focused on the studios in the portfolio.

27
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:48,789
And so we created Gameplay Space, which is a co-working space dedicated to game development.

28
00:01:48,929 --> 00:01:52,372
It's a 10,000 square foot space with over 100 developers working in the same space.

29
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:53,233
It's a non-profit.

30
00:01:54,053 --> 00:01:56,515
so much different kind of mindset. It's a very open

31
00:01:57,096 --> 00:01:59,978
environment where we say yes to everyone in terms of coming to share

32
00:02:00,258 --> 00:02:01,899
and exchange and inspire each other.

33
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,103
It's just a big open space.

34
00:02:07,563 --> 00:02:10,546
This was during construction when all the developers weren't there, but we host

35
00:02:11,046 --> 00:02:14,889
lectures and we often invite publishers or platform holders to come and give

36
00:02:14,929 --> 00:02:18,192
presentations. We run more detailed workshops and host

37
00:02:19,853 --> 00:02:22,475
networking events and showcase nights and all this kind of stuff.

38
00:02:23,216 --> 00:02:26,438
It's a really kind of powerful entity, but most importantly

39
00:02:26,859 --> 00:02:30,622
it is my channel by which I force developers to eat broccoli.

40
00:02:31,603 --> 00:02:33,924
And for those who are paying attention and reading the

41
00:02:34,225 --> 00:02:38,468
session description, you may recall that I snuck in there at Broccoli Lover.

42
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:44,951
little quote and in part it's because I oftentimes I think of all the business

43
00:02:45,112 --> 00:02:50,114
entrepreneurship stuff as the broccoli that we all need to eat but very few of

44
00:02:50,174 --> 00:02:53,536
us actually like broccoli or Brussels sprouts or whatever even though it's

45
00:02:53,596 --> 00:02:57,758
nutritious and good for us and makes us healthy and live long it's like I just

46
00:02:57,798 --> 00:03:00,319
want a hamburger and I you know I don't want to deal with those issues.

47
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:02,840
in the same way that many developers just want to code

48
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,460
and design and do all the cool fun stuff,

49
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,101
but really don't want to deal with the business stuff

50
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:10,722
or don't understand how critical the broccoli is

51
00:03:10,782 --> 00:03:13,882
to their health and long-term viability.

52
00:03:14,182 --> 00:03:16,703
And so also a lot of the lessons that I see

53
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,423
not only comes from execution labs,

54
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:21,644
as well as going around and doing a bunch of consulting work

55
00:03:21,664 --> 00:03:25,205
but also in this test environment of gameplay space

56
00:03:25,245 --> 00:03:27,786
where I try out a lot of these concepts

57
00:03:27,886 --> 00:03:28,826
and working with the teams.

58
00:03:29,606 --> 00:03:32,348
I mean, I don't have a sort of a report to give you,

59
00:03:32,408 --> 00:03:35,590
but overall, the studios that operate from Gameplay Space

60
00:03:35,931 --> 00:03:38,813
are quite successful in doing, I would say,

61
00:03:39,213 --> 00:03:43,336
better than average relative to most startups or indies.

62
00:03:43,976 --> 00:03:45,678
So before we get too deep, this is where I warn you

63
00:03:45,718 --> 00:03:49,460
that I'm not a lawyer, and so, you know,

64
00:03:49,881 --> 00:03:52,583
obviously everyone is in a different country

65
00:03:52,703 --> 00:03:55,545
and has different legal and corporate law contexts

66
00:03:55,585 --> 00:03:57,126
and tax issues and all that kind of stuff.

67
00:03:57,786 --> 00:04:04,595
And so I'm not a legal or tax expert, so, you know, obviously you have to do some conversion

68
00:04:04,615 --> 00:04:08,060
in your own brain in terms of what's relevant to your own region.

69
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:11,364
That's my sort of universal image for lawyers.

70
00:04:12,245 --> 00:04:12,685
Anyways.

71
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:15,447
All right, so if we look at the title,

72
00:04:15,467 --> 00:04:17,448
the title was called Studio Design,

73
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:20,589
Building a Foundation for Success and Avoiding Disaster.

74
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:24,951
We went through various more kind of click-baity versions,

75
00:04:25,051 --> 00:04:28,393
but we settled on this sort of midpoint title.

76
00:04:29,193 --> 00:04:31,134
And let's break it down.

77
00:04:31,954 --> 00:04:34,075
So first of all, studio design.

78
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:39,077
And I think what's important here is this notion that a studio is something to design.

79
00:04:39,197 --> 00:04:43,319
There is sort of things to do and decisions to make and it matters.

80
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:45,160
And this is not generally what we see.

81
00:04:46,396 --> 00:04:48,959
Oftentimes you see that it's kind of a mistake,

82
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:50,300
or not a mistake, but a byproduct.

83
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,722
We're working on a game and like,

84
00:04:51,882 --> 00:04:53,384
oh, I guess we need a tax ID

85
00:04:53,404 --> 00:04:54,965
to fill out these forms for Steam.

86
00:04:55,526 --> 00:04:57,048
Oh, well, we have to incorporate

87
00:04:57,068 --> 00:04:58,449
or get a company to get a tax ID.

88
00:04:58,489 --> 00:05:01,913
And it's sort of like a byproduct of wanting to make a game.

89
00:05:02,374 --> 00:05:08,383
So if I say a show of hands, who ended up sort of happening into a game company,

90
00:05:08,403 --> 00:05:11,628
like sort of, not by mistake, but like, I guess we need this thing.

91
00:05:11,648 --> 00:05:14,773
All right, everybody else was like super laser focused.

92
00:05:14,853 --> 00:05:17,417
All right, well, you're surprising me.

93
00:05:18,237 --> 00:05:19,438
because most of the time it's like,

94
00:05:19,618 --> 00:05:21,339
it's like, ah, we don't even know what's going on

95
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:24,200
and we had to do it and developers don't necessarily

96
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,502
realize kind of all the elements and things to think about

97
00:05:27,802 --> 00:05:30,643
and so you can kind of do, I mean, a word cloud.

98
00:05:31,424 --> 00:05:34,605
Normally our word cloud is focused on all the design

99
00:05:34,645 --> 00:05:36,846
and gameplay issues, not necessarily all the questions

100
00:05:37,187 --> 00:05:40,448
and things around business and marketing

101
00:05:40,688 --> 00:05:41,789
and all of that stuff.

102
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:47,872
And I think what I've certainly seen is that the more successful studios, it tends to be

103
00:05:48,252 --> 00:05:48,892
intentional.

104
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:52,974
It tends to be deliberate decisions around these elements and questions.

105
00:05:53,574 --> 00:05:54,455
They tend to do well.

106
00:05:55,015 --> 00:05:58,917
Oftentimes, when I say that, I sort of get the remarks like, oh, well, it's chicken and

107
00:05:59,037 --> 00:05:59,257
egg.

108
00:05:59,677 --> 00:06:03,579
And, you know, once you become successful, then you can go back and think about a roadmap.

109
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:08,220
treating your employees right and strategy and all this kind of stuff.

110
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,801
And people tend to think that the success comes first and

111
00:06:12,821 --> 00:06:15,261
then all the sort of more intentional choices come after.

112
00:06:15,281 --> 00:06:19,542
And while that may happen, I mean, lightning can strike at any point.

113
00:06:20,363 --> 00:06:23,363
It is much more common when you make intentional and

114
00:06:23,423 --> 00:06:27,504
deliberate decisions to begin with and that sort of puts you on the path for.

115
00:06:28,115 --> 00:06:31,018
success with a higher degree of probability.

116
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:36,483
So I think even just accepting that there is intentional and

117
00:06:36,503 --> 00:06:39,326
deliberate choices, that you have to design the business and

118
00:06:39,346 --> 00:06:42,949
design the studio and put the effort and resources into that,

119
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:47,413
I think is already, you're way ahead of most studios or

120
00:06:47,433 --> 00:06:50,637
developers who kind of, it's all very tertiary and

121
00:06:50,697 --> 00:06:51,678
aren't even thinking about it.

122
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:55,561
So that's just sort of the first part. The next part

123
00:06:55,721 --> 00:06:59,525
is this idea of building a foundation for success and I think

124
00:07:00,005 --> 00:07:01,607
success is a very tricky word.

125
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,622
that if we went around the room and asked people,

126
00:07:04,662 --> 00:07:05,943
well, how do you define success?

127
00:07:05,963 --> 00:07:07,204
What does the success look like?

128
00:07:08,225 --> 00:07:10,727
We may have all slightly different versions of that success.

129
00:07:10,787 --> 00:07:12,969
Maybe we can kind of bucket into certain categories.

130
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:14,990
You know, well, I wanna be profitable.

131
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,452
I wanna make an award-winning game,

132
00:07:16,512 --> 00:07:19,634
or, you know, I wanna pursue my dreams, you know,

133
00:07:19,654 --> 00:07:21,155
so maybe we can start bucketing it,

134
00:07:21,596 --> 00:07:23,517
but it's dangerous to kind of talk about success

135
00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:25,018
without defining it.

136
00:07:25,138 --> 00:07:27,060
And I think there's no right or wrong answer here.

137
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,581
I mean, if you look at runners,

138
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:34,244
You know, the things that the sprinter does is much different than the things that the marathoner might do.

139
00:07:34,804 --> 00:07:36,605
You know, they're both athletes, they're both runners,

140
00:07:37,485 --> 00:07:42,308
but they are training and eating and preparing and being coached

141
00:07:42,928 --> 00:07:46,530
with very specific definitions of success in mind.

142
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,151
And I think many developers, it's like,

143
00:07:49,271 --> 00:07:52,092
oh, we think we have to go to the gym and maybe do something,

144
00:07:52,212 --> 00:07:56,734
and they're not quite sort of understanding what direction they're going in.

145
00:07:57,987 --> 00:08:01,188
Or there's conflict, there's conflict between founders'

146
00:08:01,228 --> 00:08:02,188
definitions of success.

147
00:08:02,228 --> 00:08:05,388
I mean, we've seen this firsthand with Execution Labs,

148
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:07,969
where we would invest in a team,

149
00:08:07,989 --> 00:08:10,149
and as we worked together and went further,

150
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:13,170
we would uncover sort of deep-rooted conflicts

151
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:16,070
in terms of what each of the founders was trying to achieve.

152
00:08:17,051 --> 00:08:19,691
And so that's sort of an interesting process

153
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:20,551
to get to that.

154
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:24,312
One of the best examples I've seen of this issue

155
00:08:24,532 --> 00:08:26,172
actually comes from Henry Smith.

156
00:08:26,932 --> 00:08:31,119
who famously did a game called Space Team a few years ago.

157
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,564
Coincidentally enough, Henry works from Gameplay Space,

158
00:08:35,565 --> 00:08:38,610
but this was actually before Gameplay Space existed,

159
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,873
so I can't take any kind of credit

160
00:08:41,233 --> 00:08:42,175
for his achievements there.

161
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:45,097
So it was a cool, for the Zoderno space team,

162
00:08:45,137 --> 00:08:48,200
it's a mobile game, and it's a multiplayer mobile game,

163
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,042
kind of local in the sense that we're all holding our phone

164
00:08:51,462 --> 00:08:53,584
and it's telling, we have to like scream at each other

165
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:55,925
and say, okay, push this button and turn this wheel,

166
00:08:55,945 --> 00:08:57,767
we're trying to like not have our spaceship crash.

167
00:08:58,447 --> 00:09:00,349
And it's a really kind of wacky, innovative game

168
00:09:00,369 --> 00:09:02,610
and he's won tons of awards and got a lot of attention.

169
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:06,093
And one of the things people would say to him is like,

170
00:09:06,233 --> 00:09:09,455
oh, aren't you disappointed because your game was a failure.

171
00:09:10,196 --> 00:09:11,757
Henry had released the game for free.

172
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,841
without any monetization. I mean there was a little

173
00:09:15,401 --> 00:09:18,185
like donate somewhere deep in the menu but essentially

174
00:09:18,906 --> 00:09:21,709
the game was not set up to make money and

175
00:09:21,849 --> 00:09:25,173
and they would say, oh Henry we're really sorry like you know you failed

176
00:09:26,074 --> 00:09:29,018
and he's like well no I didn't fail it was a huge success because

177
00:09:29,979 --> 00:09:31,300
Making money was not my priority.

178
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,761
I had these specific priorities.

179
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:34,722
So this was his definition of success.

180
00:09:35,403 --> 00:09:36,624
He had been a AAA developer.

181
00:09:36,664 --> 00:09:38,905
He worked at BioWare and a bunch of other cool studios.

182
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,466
And so he wanted to become an indie

183
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:41,747
and he had never done that.

184
00:09:41,787 --> 00:09:44,189
So he said, oh, my goals are to learn how to.

185
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:49,914
program in iOS and deal with the App Store. I want to make something small so I can kind of have a better sense of

186
00:09:50,034 --> 00:09:52,596
judgment for my future games, get my name out there.

187
00:09:53,397 --> 00:09:58,001
And so he went on to say that actually, despite the fact that he didn't make money, the game was a huge success

188
00:09:58,442 --> 00:10:03,366
because it far outpaced what he had set as his own definition of success.

189
00:10:04,467 --> 00:10:06,048
So that's just a really nice example,

190
00:10:06,268 --> 00:10:10,492
and if you want to read that case study and see all the numbers, you can just Google Space Team Retrospective.

191
00:10:11,568 --> 00:10:15,029
But in the case of this lecture, we're going to assume that everyone here wants to make money.

192
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:21,170
This is the business track after all, and a lot of the stuff that I do tends to be this kind of

193
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:27,151
intersection of doing cool stuff, making great games, but also being entrepreneurial about it

194
00:10:27,631 --> 00:10:31,892
and generating revenue and being successful from a commercial financial point of view.

195
00:10:33,112 --> 00:10:39,033
I just gave the Henry example as one of the few cases where a developer has kind of clearly outlined what they were trying to achieve.

196
00:10:39,994 --> 00:10:42,435
but we're gonna focus more so on the business

197
00:10:43,196 --> 00:10:44,536
success type definition.

198
00:10:46,077 --> 00:10:49,419
Alright, so the last part of the title

199
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,421
is this idea of avoiding business disaster.

200
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:53,682
That's the more clickbaity piece.

201
00:10:54,762 --> 00:10:57,584
And I can tell you an endless amount of horror stories

202
00:10:57,804 --> 00:11:00,446
and disaster stories and all kinds of craziness,

203
00:11:01,206 --> 00:11:04,948
but I'll be more positive and sort of turn it into lessons.

204
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:07,989
and I guess sort of tips or advice.

205
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:09,550
So we'll frame this as lessons

206
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:13,251
without necessarily getting into all the dirty,

207
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:16,492
juicy bits of how we learned those lessons.

208
00:11:16,572 --> 00:11:19,494
All right, so lesson number one

209
00:11:20,794 --> 00:11:22,835
is that finding your co-founders

210
00:11:23,155 --> 00:11:26,416
is more important than that initial cool concept.

211
00:11:27,036 --> 00:11:30,978
So now we're going back really at the very initial phases

212
00:11:31,378 --> 00:11:32,878
of the startup process.

213
00:11:33,964 --> 00:11:37,345
And oftentimes, developers are kind of frozen

214
00:11:37,365 --> 00:11:40,566
in being able to move forward

215
00:11:40,887 --> 00:11:42,887
because they feel the burden to come up

216
00:11:42,907 --> 00:11:44,608
with the cool, awesome idea

217
00:11:45,148 --> 00:11:47,009
before they have the confidence to go ask people

218
00:11:47,049 --> 00:11:49,310
to join in their journey or become part of a studio, etc.

219
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,912
And in fact, it should be the reverse, right?

220
00:11:52,932 --> 00:11:55,473
You should find the people that you wanna work with

221
00:11:55,533 --> 00:11:58,175
and quote unquote get married to and build something with,

222
00:11:58,475 --> 00:12:00,196
and then together you figure out

223
00:12:00,736 --> 00:12:02,397
what that amazing thing is.

224
00:12:03,318 --> 00:12:04,878
And generally, when we were investing,

225
00:12:04,918 --> 00:12:08,120
we really saw it as a sort of three team,

226
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,622
co-founding team, minimum necessary.

227
00:12:11,122 --> 00:12:12,483
It was always we wanted to do someone

228
00:12:12,743 --> 00:12:14,163
in a creative leadership role,

229
00:12:14,424 --> 00:12:16,185
someone in a technical leadership role,

230
00:12:16,585 --> 00:12:19,226
and someone in a business leadership role.

231
00:12:20,447 --> 00:12:22,809
Now the business leadership role tended to be the harder one.

232
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:25,952
And in fact, in some of the deals we wanted to do,

233
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,613
we actually turned back the team and said,

234
00:12:27,633 --> 00:12:31,016
you need to find your business co-founder.

235
00:12:31,036 --> 00:12:33,758
And they would be, oh, but we're so talented and so skilled

236
00:12:33,778 --> 00:12:34,719
and our art is amazing.

237
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:36,561
Yeah, you are, but you need someone

238
00:12:36,961 --> 00:12:39,503
at that sort of same leadership level

239
00:12:39,543 --> 00:12:41,785
that can fight with you about the business stuff

240
00:12:41,805 --> 00:12:44,327
the same way that the creative and technical people

241
00:12:44,367 --> 00:12:46,389
can kind of fight with each other and debate.

242
00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:52,652
And so, and then they would go out and come back with their, you know, business co-founder

243
00:12:52,712 --> 00:12:55,534
and then those studios would perform phenomenally well.

244
00:12:56,429 --> 00:12:59,870
And so, I see this also with students, right?

245
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:02,251
I said, as a student, I mean, sure,

246
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,371
you're working on your portfolio

247
00:13:03,411 --> 00:13:05,512
and you're building interesting projects,

248
00:13:05,792 --> 00:13:07,412
but really you should be spending that time

249
00:13:07,552 --> 00:13:10,433
finding the people that you want to collaborate with

250
00:13:10,573 --> 00:13:11,574
and build a company with.

251
00:13:12,294 --> 00:13:15,175
And so, this idea of finding your founders

252
00:13:15,215 --> 00:13:17,096
or your partners first before finding

253
00:13:17,136 --> 00:13:20,997
that one awesome little cool idea is an important lesson.

254
00:13:21,037 --> 00:13:22,998
And I've seen that a lot with different studios.

255
00:13:23,758 --> 00:13:28,441
Alright, lesson number two is to set up the studio right the first time.

256
00:13:29,422 --> 00:13:35,085
And this is kind of related to the issue we mentioned before, which is like we're setting

257
00:13:35,145 --> 00:13:40,209
companies up as a byproduct of needing a tax ID to fill in our Steam forms or whatever.

258
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:47,314
And so what tends to happen is that companies are formed in the cheapest, quickest, easiest way possible.

259
00:13:48,175 --> 00:13:51,037
Now this is highly dependent on what part of the world you're in,

260
00:13:51,658 --> 00:13:58,143
and certainly some regions of the world are much more difficult, and much more expensive to set up companies, are much more painful.

261
00:13:59,144 --> 00:14:04,728
But, you know, certainly in Canada or US, you know, oftentimes you see people setting up,

262
00:14:05,088 --> 00:14:07,730
you know, just sort of a sole proprietorship type structure or an LLC.

263
00:14:08,971 --> 00:14:12,552
And then that structure doesn't serve them well as they move forward.

264
00:14:13,412 --> 00:14:16,233
And so you do have to think about what are you trying to achieve

265
00:14:16,653 --> 00:14:18,593
or what that success path looks like.

266
00:14:19,033 --> 00:14:22,034
And for example, if you think you're going to go out in a future date

267
00:14:22,054 --> 00:14:25,715
and start raising funds through venture capitalists or angels,

268
00:14:26,395 --> 00:14:29,636
generally they will only invest in a corp, in a C corp,

269
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:32,216
just because it's easier from a tax point of view.

270
00:14:32,837 --> 00:14:34,638
and the issuance of shares is much easier.

271
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:42,322
And so if you're not a C-corp in that particular case, then it becomes a burden or a hurdle

272
00:14:42,903 --> 00:14:47,405
for them to do the deal, and then they'll force you to convert your LLC into a C-corp,

273
00:14:47,946 --> 00:14:50,087
which is easier to do in certain cases or others.

274
00:14:51,508 --> 00:14:57,010
And so, you know, having made deliberate decisions and not sort of doing it as a,

275
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:01,773
oh, by accident, you can think ahead in terms of what you're actually trying to achieve

276
00:15:02,813 --> 00:15:04,434
and setting up the right corporate forms.

277
00:15:04,474 --> 00:15:06,935
Of course, this is where our lawyer friends come in again.

278
00:15:07,855 --> 00:15:11,456
And this is also kind of a sub-lesson

279
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,817
of always use professionals, right?

280
00:15:14,937 --> 00:15:19,018
Unless your mom or dad are accountants and lawyers,

281
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,999
or that you were one in a past life,

282
00:15:22,939 --> 00:15:25,500
I cannot overstate the benefit

283
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,400
of actually working with proper professionals

284
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,261
to set your companies up straight

285
00:15:29,581 --> 00:15:33,182
and the shareholder agreements and co-founder agreements

286
00:15:33,222 --> 00:15:34,942
and contracts and all that kind of stuff.

287
00:15:35,622 --> 00:15:40,466
I mean, we can spend a whole day talking about, you know, setting things up properly.

288
00:15:40,927 --> 00:15:45,630
And for those who watched Indie Game the Movie a few years back and all the drama with Phil

289
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:50,534
Fish and Fez and all that kind of stuff, that whole movie wouldn't exist if Phil had used

290
00:15:50,554 --> 00:15:55,898
a lawyer is basically the sort of the key lesson there, because they didn't set things

291
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:59,161
up right and they didn't have contracts and IP assignment and all that kind of stuff.

292
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,190
So I'll stop there because it's a fairly deep topic,

293
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:06,438
but setting things up right is critical.

294
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,142
And I see it all the time where it doesn't happen.

295
00:16:09,372 --> 00:16:12,675
All right, next one is, lesson three is pursue project

296
00:16:12,755 --> 00:16:14,798
designed for success from the start.

297
00:16:15,478 --> 00:16:18,241
Now of course, this has that loaded term success,

298
00:16:18,922 --> 00:16:20,604
so that means we actually had a discussion

299
00:16:20,664 --> 00:16:22,666
amongst ourselves as a team, as co-founders,

300
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:24,809
what is the success we're trying to achieve,

301
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:28,893
and then we're designing a project or roadmap of projects

302
00:16:29,514 --> 00:16:31,176
to achieve that kind of success.

303
00:16:32,216 --> 00:16:35,378
And so what generally happens is we sit around and we think about,

304
00:16:35,538 --> 00:16:36,859
okay, what games do we want to make?

305
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,101
So I like ninjas and robots, let's make that.

306
00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:43,123
And what games can we make?

307
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:45,824
So what skills do we have, what resources are available?

308
00:16:46,685 --> 00:16:47,465
And we stop there.

309
00:16:47,905 --> 00:16:51,267
And it tends to be that the games that we want to make and can make.

310
00:16:51,607 --> 00:16:53,790
generally are a commercial disaster.

311
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:56,112
The chances that those ones actually have

312
00:16:56,873 --> 00:16:58,755
commercial potential and a chance to succeed

313
00:16:58,775 --> 00:17:03,040
is, well, I don't want to say nil, but very difficult.

314
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,562
And so many developers don't continue

315
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,625
to say, what games should we make?

316
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:15,041
And this is where you're sort of matching the question relative to your definition of success.

317
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:21,043
And of course that's a much harder bullseye to hit, is the intersection of the things that we want to make,

318
00:17:21,183 --> 00:17:24,965
that we can make, and that we should make, and here should being, you know,

319
00:17:25,065 --> 00:17:28,706
that allow us to achieve our definition of success.

320
00:17:28,726 --> 00:17:34,669
I will often see this, particularly with younger teams, coming out of school.

321
00:17:35,629 --> 00:17:38,650
So oftentimes, schools that have game programs,

322
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,291
they might have like a senior project or a group project,

323
00:17:41,611 --> 00:17:43,032
and you have a bunch of the students working together

324
00:17:43,072 --> 00:17:46,193
in a cool game, and then they're having so much fun,

325
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,233
or the game is getting a lot of praise,

326
00:17:48,293 --> 00:17:50,414
and they're like, oh, let's go be a startup

327
00:17:50,994 --> 00:17:53,095
and live the indie life and work on this game

328
00:17:53,535 --> 00:17:54,315
and ship the game.

329
00:17:55,256 --> 00:17:57,016
And then I'll go in and look at the game and say,

330
00:17:57,036 --> 00:17:59,517
well, listen, that is a fantastic student project,

331
00:17:59,577 --> 00:18:01,738
like, you know, great, and like, yeah, we got A+,

332
00:18:01,778 --> 00:18:02,958
and it was amazing, and I said,

333
00:18:02,978 --> 00:18:04,399
that game will sell zero copies.

334
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:09,184
because it was not designed, it was not set up to be a commercial success,

335
00:18:09,244 --> 00:18:11,666
it was designed for the parameters of the course.

336
00:18:12,307 --> 00:18:15,010
It was designed to get an A+, you know, from the teacher.

337
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:19,434
And so that's what I mean that you have to think about the projects you're working on

338
00:18:19,454 --> 00:18:23,659
and they have to be sort of designed to achieve the success you want from the beginning.

339
00:18:24,379 --> 00:18:26,562
It's a similar story with Game Jam games.

340
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:31,923
You'll do a game jam and you'll have this burst of creativity over the weekend,

341
00:18:32,363 --> 00:18:33,844
and you'll make a super cool prototype,

342
00:18:34,584 --> 00:18:37,065
and you may maybe win the game jam or you get a lot of praise,

343
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:40,206
but it's very difficult then to take the game jam game

344
00:18:40,346 --> 00:18:42,187
and turn that into something that's commercially viable.

345
00:18:42,567 --> 00:18:45,868
It has happened, but I mean, I haven't looked at the numbers,

346
00:18:45,928 --> 00:18:49,049
but there are literally tens of thousands of games now

347
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:52,550
that have been made through the game jam over the span of whatever it is, ten years.

348
00:18:53,051 --> 00:18:58,336
But I mean, I can probably only count a handful that have actually gone on to being commercial

349
00:18:58,436 --> 00:18:58,896
release.

350
00:18:59,316 --> 00:19:01,499
So the percentage is extremely, extremely small.

351
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:07,144
But it's excusable because you're not sort of doing the game jam to make something that's

352
00:19:07,184 --> 00:19:11,128
the nugget for a commercially viable, sustainable, business-oriented game.

353
00:19:11,148 --> 00:19:13,730
You're there to innovate and be creative and have fun with your friends.

354
00:19:14,311 --> 00:19:17,515
So the context of a game jam is just a different context.

355
00:19:17,535 --> 00:19:22,080
So that's, again, the point of thinking about what you're creating and

356
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,865
does that actually link to what your definition of success is.

357
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:28,007
And many studios don't do that.

358
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:36,372
All right, next lesson is, and related to this previous point, is do your competitive and market analysis and do it often.

359
00:19:38,092 --> 00:19:40,894
You know, this comes up as part of the pitching process.

360
00:19:41,834 --> 00:19:44,055
When you're pitching publishers, when you're pitching investors,

361
00:19:44,735 --> 00:19:49,357
they tend to want to have a sense of where you position yourself relative to the competition.

362
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:53,399
If you're going into the marketplace, who's already there? What are gamers playing?

363
00:19:54,057 --> 00:19:57,078
et cetera, because they're trying to gauge what your chances of success are.

364
00:19:57,138 --> 00:20:02,780
And also the whole genre or category, is that a generally successful category, is it a less

365
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,561
successful category?

366
00:20:05,241 --> 00:20:10,883
And many developers won't do that until I force them to eat the broccoli and like, oh,

367
00:20:10,903 --> 00:20:14,285
I guess I have to have that slide, and then they'll go off and sort of do some analysis

368
00:20:14,345 --> 00:20:17,286
on App Annie if they're mobile or Steam Spy and so on.

369
00:20:18,727 --> 00:20:23,511
One of the best examples of this was Ryan Clark down in the corner there.

370
00:20:23,531 --> 00:20:29,797
He ran a Twitch and YouTube show called The Clark Tank,

371
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:34,861
and he was sort of broadcasting his competitive analysis.

372
00:20:35,562 --> 00:20:38,845
So he had had great success with Crypt of the Necrodancer,

373
00:20:39,646 --> 00:20:43,709
which sold a ton of copies, and so he was an indie success.

374
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:49,273
And then he realized, well, geez, I'm gonna spend another two, three years of my life

375
00:20:49,493 --> 00:20:52,656
and a bunch of my resources and money, like, I better not screw this up,

376
00:20:52,676 --> 00:20:56,578
and I need to think about what kind of game is selling, what's not,

377
00:20:56,618 --> 00:20:58,440
what genres are going up, which ones are going down.

378
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,443
And so he embarked on this process of competitive and landscape analysis,

379
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:08,366
and he sort of did this weekly show where he would go through the Steam bestsellers list.

380
00:21:08,787 --> 00:21:12,489
and look at the ones that were going up and the ones going down and kind of think through

381
00:21:12,849 --> 00:21:15,130
why was that and what trends were going on.

382
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:19,732
And thankfully he shared that process with his viewers.

383
00:21:21,053 --> 00:21:27,516
He paused a bit when I think he went deep on his new game, Industries of Titan.

384
00:21:28,337 --> 00:21:31,579
but Industries of Titan is a direct result of that process.

385
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:34,480
Now, I really hope the game is a massive success

386
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,661
and then I'll sort of use that as a continuation

387
00:21:36,681 --> 00:21:38,882
of the value of doing that,

388
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:43,525
but he's sort of been the most visible example

389
00:21:43,565 --> 00:21:45,966
of this competitive analysis process.

390
00:21:46,606 --> 00:21:48,487
Last year at GDC and the Indie Game Summit,

391
00:21:48,547 --> 00:21:50,128
there was another lecture I thought was really good

392
00:21:50,448 --> 00:21:53,070
called Know Your Market, Making Indie Games That Sell.

393
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,231
It was an indie developer named Eric Johnson

394
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:56,111
from Infinite Monkey.

395
00:21:56,852 --> 00:21:58,993
It's available on the Vault, I think it's one of the free ones.

396
00:21:59,933 --> 00:22:05,916
And he did some really deep crunching on numbers and was looking at median sales relative to

397
00:22:05,936 --> 00:22:07,356
certain tags and genres.

398
00:22:08,277 --> 00:22:10,018
I guess this font is a bit small.

399
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:13,159
I can barely even see it.

400
00:22:14,107 --> 00:22:20,092
So, you know, action RPG is the tallest bar as one of the examples of a genre that's performing well.

401
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:24,295
I mean, this is data from a year ago, so maybe that's sort of higher or lower.

402
00:22:24,516 --> 00:22:28,419
I mean, this is why you want to do competitive analysis frequently, RPGs and so on.

403
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:32,442
But, like, puzzle platformer is this tiny little slice at the end.

404
00:22:33,142 --> 00:22:36,304
And so this is an example where a lot of developers will say,

405
00:22:36,324 --> 00:22:37,685
oh, let's make a puzzle platform.

406
00:22:37,785 --> 00:22:39,426
It's a genre that we're fans of.

407
00:22:39,466 --> 00:22:42,408
There's so many classic great examples of puzzle platforms

408
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:43,028
we all love.

409
00:22:43,649 --> 00:22:45,710
And it's relatively easy to make.

410
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,131
All right, let's go make it.

411
00:22:47,531 --> 00:22:49,933
And then you don't realize that in fact,

412
00:22:50,073 --> 00:22:52,915
the landscape for puzzle platform is hyper-competitive,

413
00:22:52,975 --> 00:22:55,956
super saturated, and from a revenue point of view,

414
00:22:55,976 --> 00:22:59,178
just does not represent a meaningful opportunity

415
00:22:59,218 --> 00:22:59,979
to generate sales.

416
00:23:00,899 --> 00:23:05,302
just as an example. And then he did another one where he was looking at, this

417
00:23:05,362 --> 00:23:10,365
wasn't genres, I think it was like specific attributes or tags, and you know

418
00:23:10,425 --> 00:23:15,668
again here the really high bar is it's moddable or team-based, online,

419
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:20,711
multiplayer, etc. But on the far end where you can barely see like one

420
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:23,532
line of pixels of blue is four-player co-op.

421
00:23:24,573 --> 00:23:30,036
And this was you know I wasn't surprised by this because if any of you watch some of my past lectures

422
00:23:30,376 --> 00:23:36,820
I always beat up on four-player co-op even though even though it's a fun style of game from a commercial perspective

423
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,482
It's a very challenging genre to be in it doesn't lend itself well to

424
00:23:42,063 --> 00:23:46,965
To sales because again it assumes that I have friends and then I have a sofa and I have four controllers and etc

425
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,821
But here was some of the data to kind of validate that.

426
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:51,261
So now, if we were sitting around saying,

427
00:23:51,281 --> 00:23:53,722
let's make a party game, a four-player co-op,

428
00:23:53,742 --> 00:23:54,763
we love those games.

429
00:23:55,023 --> 00:23:57,264
We remember Towerfall from years ago.

430
00:23:57,724 --> 00:23:58,485
Let's go do it.

431
00:23:59,245 --> 00:24:00,406
And it all sounds great and fun,

432
00:24:00,446 --> 00:24:02,567
but you never stop to do your analysis.

433
00:24:03,247 --> 00:24:04,828
It's like you're gonna have a hard time

434
00:24:05,228 --> 00:24:07,009
getting investors, getting publishers,

435
00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:08,669
getting people to back the game.

436
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,790
Unless you're independently wealthy

437
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,011
and can just do whatever you want.

438
00:24:12,371 --> 00:24:16,235
That's going to be a really hard time to build a successful studio behind.

439
00:24:16,256 --> 00:24:22,803
Anyway, so that's from last year, just a great example of doing this kind of deeper analysis

440
00:24:23,163 --> 00:24:25,186
that we rarely see from developers.

441
00:24:25,995 --> 00:24:27,216
All right, lesson number five.

442
00:24:28,256 --> 00:24:31,138
Accept that you are not in the game making business,

443
00:24:31,758 --> 00:24:33,679
you are now in the fan building business.

444
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,981
And this is a very deep, very fundamental,

445
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,943
philosophical shift that I try to,

446
00:24:40,963 --> 00:24:43,044
you know, again, force the broccoli on.

447
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,625
But again, if you've determined,

448
00:24:45,645 --> 00:24:47,466
or if you set commercial success

449
00:24:47,566 --> 00:24:49,707
in building a sustainable, viable studio,

450
00:24:50,107 --> 00:24:52,949
generating revenue, and making great games,

451
00:24:54,269 --> 00:24:56,491
You're almost not in the game making business, right?

452
00:24:56,511 --> 00:24:58,832
You're not just sort of sitting there making a game,

453
00:24:59,212 --> 00:25:00,973
you are really making a community,

454
00:25:00,993 --> 00:25:02,114
you're making a fan base.

455
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:04,315
I mean, this year at GDC is the first year

456
00:25:04,335 --> 00:25:07,537
we have the discoverability series of lectures.

457
00:25:08,238 --> 00:25:09,518
A lot of the stuff that we hear about

458
00:25:09,578 --> 00:25:11,179
tends to be about community engagement

459
00:25:11,199 --> 00:25:15,042
and using all kinds of tools to engage a community.

460
00:25:15,402 --> 00:25:18,264
But I think actually it goes way deeper than that,

461
00:25:18,344 --> 00:25:20,005
and it's about thinking about your business

462
00:25:20,105 --> 00:25:22,626
primarily as a fan base building business.

463
00:25:22,967 --> 00:25:27,649
and that everything you do really is about capturing that fan base,

464
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:30,351
delighting the fan base, engaging with that fan base,

465
00:25:31,111 --> 00:25:34,493
and then sort of having them follow you through the journey of the studio.

466
00:25:35,473 --> 00:25:39,436
And a great example of that is a Montreal-based studio, Kit Fox Games.

467
00:25:40,176 --> 00:25:42,697
Actually, Tanya, who's the one here in the black cardigan,

468
00:25:42,717 --> 00:25:46,059
is giving a couple of lectures at GDC, and so is Victoria,

469
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,861
the one doing the sort of dabbish movement.

470
00:25:50,321 --> 00:25:54,903
And their current game is Boyfriend Dungeon,

471
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,123
which has been getting a lot of buzz and hype.

472
00:25:57,163 --> 00:25:58,744
They had a massive Kickstarter,

473
00:25:59,444 --> 00:26:00,564
but it didn't happen overnight.

474
00:26:01,404 --> 00:26:02,745
They started, I think it was 2013.

475
00:26:02,785 --> 00:26:06,386
They did a barely break-even mobile game

476
00:26:06,426 --> 00:26:07,206
called Shattered Planet.

477
00:26:07,686 --> 00:26:09,247
Moon Hunters did moderately better.

478
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,329
Shrouded Isle did better still.

479
00:26:11,429 --> 00:26:13,611
Now Boyfriend Dungeon's their next game.

480
00:26:14,311 --> 00:26:19,055
But importantly, they were sort of focusing

481
00:26:19,155 --> 00:26:20,756
all of their fans on Kit Fox.

482
00:26:21,537 --> 00:26:23,238
And that Kit Fox itself was having

483
00:26:23,298 --> 00:26:26,660
this sort of a sense of identity and a brand and a focus.

484
00:26:26,681 --> 00:26:28,822
A lot of the games they do, or all the games they do,

485
00:26:28,982 --> 00:26:31,544
are based on procedural technology,

486
00:26:31,604 --> 00:26:32,645
procedural level generation.

487
00:26:33,366 --> 00:26:39,352
Tanya is a former MMO AAA writer, and so their games are very writerly and narrative-focused.

488
00:26:40,013 --> 00:26:44,778
And so even though their games look different, different style, different genre, they were

489
00:26:44,859 --> 00:26:50,665
able to sort of go after fans who like those kinds of games and sort of funnel them into

490
00:26:50,685 --> 00:26:51,706
the Kit Fox world.

491
00:26:52,167 --> 00:26:56,473
such that those fans were ready for the next one and ready for the next one and ready for the next one.

492
00:26:57,093 --> 00:26:59,537
So when they launched the Boyfriend Dungeon Kickstarter,

493
00:27:00,138 --> 00:27:02,120
all of their fans just sort of piled in,

494
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:07,828
and within, I think it was like four hours, they had more than surpassed their Kickstarter goal.

495
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:12,252
And so this is kind of a part of a long-term planning process.

496
00:27:12,993 --> 00:27:18,198
And last year at DEVCOM there was a great quote from Sarah Lynn Smith,

497
00:27:18,218 --> 00:27:20,841
who's the Senior Director of Global Community at Blizzard,

498
00:27:21,321 --> 00:27:22,983
and she had this great line about, you know,

499
00:27:23,023 --> 00:27:26,246
embrace the great fandom frontier and how Blizzard sees

500
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:29,349
or they believe that game building is community building.

501
00:27:29,889 --> 00:27:34,152
And so what we often see, whether it's community or marketing,

502
00:27:34,592 --> 00:27:38,575
is that thing that you do after you're done with your game making.

503
00:27:39,095 --> 00:27:42,938
Or it's the thing you make a little tweet on Saturday when you're not busy making the game.

504
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:47,481
And so I think you really have to see it as sort of inseparable.

505
00:27:47,521 --> 00:27:48,822
It is completely coupled.

506
00:27:49,222 --> 00:27:53,625
The process of making the game is the process of making the community and vice versa.

507
00:27:54,386 --> 00:27:57,287
And so that means that you need to have the right people,

508
00:27:57,347 --> 00:27:59,628
have the right resources, implement the right tools,

509
00:28:00,269 --> 00:28:01,529
plan that labor.

510
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,750
It's not the other stuff that you do

511
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:04,911
when you have a spare moment.

512
00:28:05,751 --> 00:28:08,673
It is central and core to the success of your game,

513
00:28:08,713 --> 00:28:12,035
but more importantly, the success of the studio.

514
00:28:12,115 --> 00:28:13,956
So it may seem like a slight sort of,

515
00:28:15,176 --> 00:28:16,597
maybe it's a shift in my thinking,

516
00:28:17,598 --> 00:28:19,999
but understanding that building community

517
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:23,241
or building fan base is your business.

518
00:28:24,293 --> 00:28:26,374
All right, related to that, lesson six,

519
00:28:27,735 --> 00:28:28,975
and I've talked about this before,

520
00:28:29,055 --> 00:28:31,416
build momentum by building scaffolding.

521
00:28:32,596 --> 00:28:35,677
And so the idea of scaffolding

522
00:28:35,897 --> 00:28:38,138
is that you are building that kind of momentum.

523
00:28:38,638 --> 00:28:40,839
So Kit Fox, again, serves as a great example

524
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:43,760
in that they had a vision, they had a roadmap.

525
00:28:44,332 --> 00:28:47,994
All of the games they were working on were procedural, narrative-driven, etc.

526
00:28:48,555 --> 00:28:52,237
They had a target audience in mind and were able to sort of funnel that towards them.

527
00:28:52,958 --> 00:28:56,981
They come to GDC and get invited to other conferences that talk about procedural stuff.

528
00:28:57,621 --> 00:29:01,824
When investors or publishers want to look at studios that do that kind of thing, they

529
00:29:01,844 --> 00:29:06,007
go see Tanya and the Kitfox team because they've built a reputation for it within the industry.

530
00:29:06,868 --> 00:29:13,454
You know, whenever there's articles on Kotaku or Polygon that want to talk about the trend

531
00:29:13,494 --> 00:29:15,516
of procedural games, they give Kitfox a call.

532
00:29:16,577 --> 00:29:21,242
You know, the tools that they build, the technology that they work on evolves and grows over time.

533
00:29:21,602 --> 00:29:26,646
When they hire people, they hire people that have the right mindset or experience to do

534
00:29:26,686 --> 00:29:27,767
those kinds of games.

535
00:29:28,248 --> 00:29:33,392
And so there's all kinds of momentum that's built on many different fronts that sort of

536
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:38,056
builds or increases the probability of ongoing success for the students.

537
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:39,977
This is the idea of like you're building the scaffolding.

538
00:29:40,594 --> 00:29:43,176
to support the foundation of the studio.

539
00:29:44,056 --> 00:29:47,519
And you don't get that if one day we start a company,

540
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:48,760
we say, oh, I like racing games,

541
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,121
let's make a racing VR game.

542
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:52,603
And it doesn't work well because VR is not selling.

543
00:29:52,623 --> 00:29:54,464
All right, well, let's do, we hear Pokemon Go is cool,

544
00:29:54,484 --> 00:29:58,407
so let's do a Ninjas Go, it's Lego,

545
00:29:58,447 --> 00:29:59,808
but whatever, Ninjas AR.

546
00:30:01,249 --> 00:30:04,031
And so we abandon all the racing stuff and all the VR stuff,

547
00:30:04,051 --> 00:30:07,073
and then we go do ninjas running around the street.

548
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:09,034
And then, well, it doesn't work because we're not Pokemon,

549
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:10,976
so let's go do a Steam game.

550
00:30:11,056 --> 00:30:13,337
And so you're just sort of resetting,

551
00:30:13,497 --> 00:30:16,099
restarting different tools, different technology,

552
00:30:16,379 --> 00:30:18,321
different talent set, different fan base.

553
00:30:18,761 --> 00:30:21,023
You're not really building any momentum.

554
00:30:22,043 --> 00:30:25,246
As a tangible example of that, I think it was last week or the week before,

555
00:30:25,746 --> 00:30:28,769
Kit Fox announced that they were publishing Dwarf Fortress,

556
00:30:28,809 --> 00:30:31,811
the one with the sort of the graphical tileset.

557
00:30:32,412 --> 00:30:36,034
Dwarf Fortress, for those who don't know, is I think it's like a 15-year-old game.

558
00:30:36,375 --> 00:30:40,738
It's like an ASCII-based, super deep procedural simulation-based game.

559
00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:46,222
It's only available through the developers' website and as a Patreon thing.

560
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:50,546
But Tanya met Tarn, who's the creator of the game,

561
00:30:50,886 --> 00:30:53,208
at some of the GDC panels, and they both are working

562
00:30:53,248 --> 00:30:55,389
on deep procedural simulations.

563
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:58,952
And it was a really natural fit then for Kit Fox

564
00:30:58,992 --> 00:31:02,354
to work with the studio behind Dwarf Fortress.

565
00:31:02,954 --> 00:31:05,716
And they communicated that wonderfully to the fan base.

566
00:31:05,736 --> 00:31:07,498
And everyone was like, this is a match made in heaven.

567
00:31:07,538 --> 00:31:08,398
This is wonderful.

568
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:09,979
You know, I will buy it immediately

569
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:12,281
as soon as it's available on Steam,

570
00:31:12,801 --> 00:31:14,343
as opposed to any kind of backlash

571
00:31:14,383 --> 00:31:15,383
or what the hell's going on.

572
00:31:16,104 --> 00:31:18,966
because of that scaffolding, because of that momentum,

573
00:31:19,006 --> 00:31:24,130
because of the cohesion of the vision and roadmap

574
00:31:24,611 --> 00:31:27,293
lent itself to that, just as an example

575
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:28,274
or a manifestation of that.

576
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:35,460
Alright, lesson number seven is to always pitch opportunities, not problems.

577
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:42,264
And this was a kind of a fundamental point at my lecture, on my funding lecture last year,

578
00:31:42,785 --> 00:31:49,830
in that so many developers see funding and pitching as a solution to their missing money problem.

579
00:31:50,589 --> 00:31:52,370
We're all working hard, we're problem solvers,

580
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,350
we're working on our code, and then we wake up one day,

581
00:31:54,571 --> 00:31:56,091
oh crap, we're missing money,

582
00:31:56,131 --> 00:31:58,832
we gotta go solve our lack of money problem.

583
00:31:59,072 --> 00:32:00,113
And they just go out into the world,

584
00:32:00,153 --> 00:32:01,993
they come to GDC, and they look for the people

585
00:32:02,013 --> 00:32:03,634
with the money and say, hey, I have this problem,

586
00:32:03,914 --> 00:32:05,755
I'm missing money, do you wanna give me a bag of money?

587
00:32:05,775 --> 00:32:06,855
And everyone's like, I don't care

588
00:32:06,895 --> 00:32:08,676
about your missing money problem.

589
00:32:09,516 --> 00:32:12,037
And so last year, if this particular area

590
00:32:12,057 --> 00:32:14,197
is of interest to you, I did this kind of deep,

591
00:32:14,298 --> 00:32:17,339
deep look at the forking of opportunity

592
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:18,319
relative to investor.

593
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:21,102
And the first fork is really the split between,

594
00:32:21,242 --> 00:32:22,965
are we talking about a commercial opportunity

595
00:32:23,365 --> 00:32:24,186
or non-commercial?

596
00:32:24,246 --> 00:32:26,149
And I gave examples of what a non-commercial, right?

597
00:32:26,169 --> 00:32:27,390
You're working on a piece of art

598
00:32:27,771 --> 00:32:30,174
or something, a more serious game or social impact game.

599
00:32:30,955 --> 00:32:32,617
And so there's other sources of funding for that.

600
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:33,979
But if you're looking at a commercial.

601
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:38,504
a project, a commercial opportunity, then you really have to decide whether this is

602
00:32:38,564 --> 00:32:39,725
the projects that the thing

603
00:32:39,986 --> 00:32:43,069
that represents the opportunity or is it the company

604
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:47,695
that represents the opportunity. And the important thing to understand is that

605
00:32:48,115 --> 00:32:50,859
that fork dramatically shifts

606
00:32:51,339 --> 00:32:54,583
how you pitch, who you pitch to, how the deals are structured.

607
00:32:55,043 --> 00:32:57,385
terms, sources, all that kind of stuff.

608
00:32:58,085 --> 00:33:00,666
And so 99% of the developers

609
00:33:01,247 --> 00:33:03,648
who are trying to solve their missing money problem

610
00:33:04,088 --> 00:33:06,729
don't understand that that second fork even exists.

611
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,750
Right, to them it's I'm missing money,

612
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:09,931
I go get a bag of cash.

613
00:33:10,411 --> 00:33:11,732
And you first have to understand,

614
00:33:11,892 --> 00:33:14,293
you know, well is it the project or is it the company?

615
00:33:15,514 --> 00:33:17,795
My whole lecture from last year is specifically about that,

616
00:33:17,855 --> 00:33:18,955
so I'd encourage you to go see that,

617
00:33:18,996 --> 00:33:20,516
but just quick, quick, quick.

618
00:33:21,257 --> 00:33:24,099
On the project side, this tends to be games as products.

619
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,562
It tends to be things that are premium.

620
00:33:26,962 --> 00:33:28,904
It tends to be things that are consumable,

621
00:33:30,025 --> 00:33:33,548
often Steam or PC and console,

622
00:33:34,349 --> 00:33:36,911
and sort of represents a linear success curve.

623
00:33:37,071 --> 00:33:39,734
You know, I sell units and I sort of succeed

624
00:33:39,754 --> 00:33:40,695
in a linear manner.

625
00:33:41,235 --> 00:33:42,536
Whereas on the company side,

626
00:33:42,596 --> 00:33:44,958
this tends to be things that are games as a service.

627
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:50,146
that are highly scalable, multiplayer, in theory,

628
00:33:50,426 --> 00:33:53,130
are endless and infinite in their consumption.

629
00:33:53,511 --> 00:33:55,634
So stuff like Fortnite and League of Legends

630
00:33:55,674 --> 00:33:56,715
and Hearthstone, et cetera.

631
00:33:57,617 --> 00:33:58,738
Often this means free to play,

632
00:33:58,758 --> 00:34:00,280
but it doesn't have to mean free to play.

633
00:34:01,501 --> 00:34:07,403
And so, just super quick, unless you are pursuing projects

634
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:10,084
and your vision is to do things that are highly scalable,

635
00:34:10,524 --> 00:34:13,745
exponential growth potential, don't even bother

636
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:16,685
trying to get equity VC angel investment in your company,

637
00:34:16,705 --> 00:34:18,426
because they won't even listen to you.

638
00:34:19,466 --> 00:34:22,227
If it's really about the project and it's sort of a product,

639
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:23,947
then you want to look at project sources,

640
00:34:23,987 --> 00:34:26,728
which is publishers and Kickstarter and government funds

641
00:34:26,768 --> 00:34:27,548
and all that kind of stuff.

642
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:31,111
I'll stop there because there's a whole lecture on that from last year.

643
00:34:32,552 --> 00:34:33,452
Alright, lesson number eight.

644
00:34:34,733 --> 00:34:38,436
Match your business model to the game's needs, not your preference.

645
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:41,458
I'm business model agnostic.

646
00:34:42,479 --> 00:34:44,561
Premium is great if it makes sense.

647
00:34:44,921 --> 00:34:46,142
Free-to-play is great if it makes sense.

648
00:34:46,262 --> 00:34:47,643
Ad-driven is great if it makes sense.

649
00:34:48,144 --> 00:34:52,827
It really is a question of what business model will enable the game to succeed.

650
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,962
And more often than not, I see the reverse,

651
00:34:56,042 --> 00:34:57,863
which is, which business model

652
00:34:57,883 --> 00:34:59,324
does the developer want to implement?

653
00:35:00,225 --> 00:35:02,246
Often, or historically, this has been sort of the issue

654
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,167
of people not being comfortable with free-to-play,

655
00:35:04,828 --> 00:35:06,629
or not having the experience for free-to-play.

656
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:10,912
But the most sort of tangible example I see of that now

657
00:35:11,352 --> 00:35:14,514
is multiplayer-only games that are premium.

658
00:35:15,564 --> 00:35:18,747
A multiplayer-only game is screaming to be free.

659
00:35:19,447 --> 00:35:20,608
It's screaming to be free to play,

660
00:35:21,069 --> 00:35:23,371
because as a developer, the most critical thing

661
00:35:23,411 --> 00:35:24,732
is getting players into the game

662
00:35:24,752 --> 00:35:26,094
so your lobbies aren't empty,

663
00:35:26,114 --> 00:35:29,377
that there's matches or whatever the game format is.

664
00:35:29,397 --> 00:35:31,699
And if you don't get those players in the lobby,

665
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,921
then your game is gonna take a quick nosedive,

666
00:35:34,141 --> 00:35:35,582
and it's sort of a spiral of death.

667
00:35:36,543 --> 00:35:38,785
And it's the multiplayer-only,

668
00:35:38,926 --> 00:35:40,727
premium-pricing spiral of death.

669
00:35:41,828 --> 00:35:44,691
There's other examples, but that's sort of the most obvious one.

670
00:35:45,532 --> 00:35:48,294
And then oftentimes I'll advise a student, I'll say,

671
00:35:48,995 --> 00:35:50,296
hey, why are you doing that?

672
00:35:50,576 --> 00:35:52,257
Like, this game really should be free to play.

673
00:35:52,578 --> 00:35:56,001
Like, ah, well, that's tricky and we don't really know how to do it.

674
00:35:56,081 --> 00:36:00,004
And, you know, we need to make some money, so we're going to put 20 bucks on it.

675
00:36:00,084 --> 00:36:01,826
It's like, dude, nobody cares.

676
00:36:01,946 --> 00:36:04,228
Like, that's not how you're supposed to make that decision.

677
00:36:04,608 --> 00:36:06,730
You have to make the decision based on the model

678
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,632
that will actually enable the game to succeed.

679
00:36:09,152 --> 00:36:13,156
Once you figure that out, then you go back and say, well, geez, how do we make this work?

680
00:36:13,456 --> 00:36:14,177
How do we deliver it?

681
00:36:14,237 --> 00:36:15,058
Who do we have to hire?

682
00:36:15,118 --> 00:36:15,719
What expertise?

683
00:36:15,739 --> 00:36:16,599
What do we have to learn?

684
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,485
And then you sort of solve that problem, but the end user, the marketplace doesn't care

685
00:36:22,885 --> 00:36:27,750
what your internal challenges are, what you like or don't like, or which one you worked

686
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:28,791
on on your last game.

687
00:36:29,752 --> 00:36:31,574
And so I see this mistake.

688
00:36:32,134 --> 00:36:38,098
quite often is that you're making your business model decisions based on excuses or sort of

689
00:36:38,118 --> 00:36:41,200
lack of understanding as opposed to looking at the game and saying what do I really need

690
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,542
to do to make that game succeed.

691
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:50,707
Alright lesson number nine, do not focus on launching, focus on launching successfully.

692
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:55,512
Right, so game developers, trained as artists

693
00:36:55,552 --> 00:36:56,753
and programmers and designers,

694
00:36:57,613 --> 00:37:01,195
are so focused on the product and sort of delivering

695
00:37:01,215 --> 00:37:03,537
or developing it and then shipping it.

696
00:37:04,457 --> 00:37:06,778
And they forget that they have to do the marketing

697
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,619
or they don't have the time or resources

698
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:10,160
or understanding how to do the marketing.

699
00:37:11,161 --> 00:37:14,202
And so they're like, well, hey, my job is a game developer

700
00:37:14,242 --> 00:37:16,664
and my business is a game making business,

701
00:37:17,124 --> 00:37:18,605
so I'm focused on making the game

702
00:37:18,645 --> 00:37:19,485
and getting it out the door.

703
00:37:20,246 --> 00:37:24,169
And sometimes they'll rely on publishers to worry about the marketing piece.

704
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:28,353
Sometimes they'll just sort of pray to the gods of Walmart or Steam that it all works out.

705
00:37:29,314 --> 00:37:32,317
And this is the whole sort of joke about,

706
00:37:32,337 --> 00:37:36,822
if my game goes out into the world, will anybody even notice it?

707
00:37:37,142 --> 00:37:39,604
And that's the whole discoverability challenge.

708
00:37:39,905 --> 00:37:41,887
And so the point is, as a studio...

709
00:37:42,687 --> 00:37:46,171
Since we've already sort of accepted that we're in the fan-based building business,

710
00:37:46,191 --> 00:37:49,554
we're not just in the, I make games and put them out the door business.

711
00:37:50,374 --> 00:37:51,896
You have to be thinking about all these things.

712
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:55,439
You have to be thinking about what do I need to do in order for

713
00:37:55,479 --> 00:37:57,361
the launch to be a successful launch?

714
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:02,543
and getting the game out the door will not achieve that.

715
00:38:03,024 --> 00:38:04,604
Listen, making games is difficult.

716
00:38:05,464 --> 00:38:07,825
It's a great accomplishment to get a game released.

717
00:38:08,566 --> 00:38:10,506
You know, high fives, pop the champagne.

718
00:38:10,586 --> 00:38:12,787
I mean, it really is not easy to do that.

719
00:38:13,548 --> 00:38:16,409
But again, if you're trying to build a successful business,

720
00:38:16,469 --> 00:38:19,810
a successful studio, a viable studio, that's not enough.

721
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:23,391
Right, you have to be thinking about the successful launch.

722
00:38:23,932 --> 00:38:28,055
That also means you need to be thinking about that from a budgeting and scheduling point of view.

723
00:38:28,575 --> 00:38:34,199
And so I often talk about this in this sort of metaphor of the bridge halfway built.

724
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,422
This bridge is completely useless, right?

725
00:38:38,522 --> 00:38:42,485
Well, the goal is to get to the other side of the river, and so we need to plan.

726
00:38:43,512 --> 00:38:47,357
the timing, the resources, the labor, the beams, whatever,

727
00:38:47,677 --> 00:38:48,658
to get to the other side.

728
00:38:49,479 --> 00:38:53,684
And so many studios don't see the other side as the goal,

729
00:38:53,924 --> 00:38:56,407
they see the middle, which is finishing the game,

730
00:38:56,607 --> 00:38:58,029
and then they're there in the middle of the river,

731
00:38:58,049 --> 00:38:58,369
and they're like,

732
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:01,871
oh crap, we did not plan for there to be a soft launch,

733
00:39:01,911 --> 00:39:04,652
or we thought early access was only gonna be one month,

734
00:39:04,692 --> 00:39:06,373
but now it's gonna need to last six months,

735
00:39:06,413 --> 00:39:07,894
and we have no more cash flow, and no more,

736
00:39:08,794 --> 00:39:09,895
you know, we can't pay our staff,

737
00:39:09,955 --> 00:39:11,116
or whatever the case may be,

738
00:39:11,136 --> 00:39:12,936
because they didn't realize

739
00:39:12,956 --> 00:39:14,277
that they're not trying to be in the middle of the river,

740
00:39:14,297 --> 00:39:16,178
they're trying to be on the other side of the river.

741
00:39:16,879 --> 00:39:20,500
So this one, you know, can surprise you at the last minute,

742
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:22,962
and everyone's feeling happy that they've made a game,

743
00:39:23,002 --> 00:39:23,822
and then it goes out there,

744
00:39:23,842 --> 00:39:25,323
and then you blame the Indiapocalypse,

745
00:39:25,343 --> 00:39:26,263
and all this kind of nonsense.

746
00:39:27,113 --> 00:39:32,961
But the reality is you build half a bridge and that's not success.

747
00:39:33,641 --> 00:39:36,305
And so you have to be planning, scheduling, budgeting,

748
00:39:36,325 --> 00:39:41,291
to get fully across to the other side of the river.

749
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:44,308
All right, the tenth lesson, final lesson,

750
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:49,775
is this idea of having a giving or ecosystem mindset.

751
00:39:50,356 --> 00:39:53,300
So I've been in the game industry, well, 23, 24,

752
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,545
this is my 23rd GDC, and I believe deeply

753
00:39:57,945 --> 00:40:00,649
in the passion and the drive and the love of games

754
00:40:00,669 --> 00:40:01,690
and the love of game making.

755
00:40:02,271 --> 00:40:03,271
that the industry has.

756
00:40:03,751 --> 00:40:07,233
I've always been very giving and sort of sharing

757
00:40:07,273 --> 00:40:08,774
and a lot of the things that I've built

758
00:40:08,834 --> 00:40:10,514
like execution labs and gameplay space

759
00:40:11,015 --> 00:40:15,216
and previously I was actually the head of the IGDA,

760
00:40:15,237 --> 00:40:16,757
the International Game Developers Association

761
00:40:16,797 --> 00:40:17,678
for many years.

762
00:40:18,758 --> 00:40:22,779
And so I sort of have this deep sense of community and ecosystem.

763
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:26,461
And in Montreal, where I'm based, we have that.

764
00:40:26,601 --> 00:40:27,901
Everyone is so supportive.

765
00:40:28,401 --> 00:40:33,363
Everyone is helping and ready to give advice and feedback and help each other out.

766
00:40:34,263 --> 00:40:39,645
And I'm saddened when I do go to other parts of the world where that sort of ethos is not there.

767
00:40:40,565 --> 00:40:43,866
And in particular, you see that sometimes where one studio has some success

768
00:40:43,906 --> 00:40:45,207
and they go off in the mountains and hide.

769
00:40:45,807 --> 00:40:47,888
And they want to protect that success from the rest of the...

770
00:40:48,317 --> 00:40:49,017
the ecosystem.

771
00:40:49,637 --> 00:40:52,938
And so I'd encourage you, as you build successful businesses,

772
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:56,220
as you grow and learn, to share that

773
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,200
with the other developers in the community,

774
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,081
whether that's virtual or down the street,

775
00:41:00,881 --> 00:41:02,862
and sort of help the whole thing grow.

776
00:41:03,162 --> 00:41:06,323
I mean, systems are such complicated sort of black boxes

777
00:41:06,383 --> 00:41:07,824
with so many inputs and outputs.

778
00:41:08,704 --> 00:41:12,306
And having this kind of giving an ecosystem mindset,

779
00:41:12,886 --> 00:41:15,887
well, that may sound a bit sort of fluffy and soft.

780
00:41:16,627 --> 00:41:20,512
I think actually does contribute to the success of a studio,

781
00:41:21,393 --> 00:41:26,718
sort of being a part of the fabric of the community.

782
00:41:27,699 --> 00:41:28,881
And then I'll throw in related to that

783
00:41:28,901 --> 00:41:31,804
sort of a bonus lesson, don't be an asshole.

784
00:41:31,824 --> 00:41:35,608
I mean, we see that often these days.

785
00:41:35,668 --> 00:41:36,309
I mean, there's a lot of...

786
00:41:36,849 --> 00:41:41,193
sort of tension around labor and crunch

787
00:41:41,253 --> 00:41:43,696
and studios shutting down and all that kind of stuff

788
00:41:43,716 --> 00:41:45,097
and people making bad decisions

789
00:41:45,197 --> 00:41:48,380
or surprising hundreds of staff that,

790
00:41:48,441 --> 00:41:50,282
oops, tomorrow we're shutting down, this kind of stuff.

791
00:41:51,183 --> 00:41:54,687
And so even though this talk has been more of a,

792
00:41:55,007 --> 00:41:57,229
you know, it has been a business-oriented,

793
00:41:58,130 --> 00:41:59,291
commercially-oriented talk.

794
00:42:00,693 --> 00:42:04,957
I think we can all do that in a less asshole-ish way.

795
00:42:04,997 --> 00:42:06,659
There's a great book, The No-Asshole Rule,

796
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:09,882
and actually Robert Sutton has written a bunch of books on this stuff.

797
00:42:10,302 --> 00:42:13,165
But I'm going to assume everyone in here is not an asshole and is super nice.

798
00:42:14,387 --> 00:42:20,333
But I guess the ultimate lesson, and so I don't have to end on the asshole comment,

799
00:42:20,373 --> 00:42:22,895
but really the ultimate thing, of course, is to make great games.

800
00:42:23,796 --> 00:42:28,438
that ultimately, even if you make all these deliberate choices and decisions and think

801
00:42:28,478 --> 00:42:34,361
about your business, all that kind of stuff, none of that replaces the need to make great,

802
00:42:34,621 --> 00:42:36,162
visionary, compelling games.

803
00:42:36,642 --> 00:42:40,023
It's just what we see today is making the great games isn't enough.

804
00:42:40,104 --> 00:42:44,886
You do need to think in this much more holistic, get to the other side of the river mindset.

805
00:42:44,946 --> 00:42:47,887
But fundamentally, it starts with making great games.

806
00:42:48,767 --> 00:42:49,348
Thank you very much.

807
00:42:56,292 --> 00:42:56,672
All right.

808
00:42:57,873 --> 00:42:59,814
So we do have some time for questions.

809
00:43:00,334 --> 00:43:03,215
If you have questions, can you just line up in the center?

810
00:43:03,235 --> 00:43:04,836
There's a mic on the floor.

811
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:09,538
I'm happy to address any of the points or lessons

812
00:43:09,578 --> 00:43:10,379
that I made here.

813
00:43:10,899 --> 00:43:13,440
But of course, if you have sort of slightly different

814
00:43:14,181 --> 00:43:19,123
questions, I'm happy to dig into that as well.

815
00:43:20,043 --> 00:43:20,924
All right, we have someone.

816
00:43:21,284 --> 00:43:22,124
Don't be shy.

817
00:43:22,144 --> 00:43:23,445
All right, go ahead.

818
00:43:24,065 --> 00:43:24,285
Hello.

819
00:43:25,264 --> 00:43:29,467
So you mentioned about the three co-founders,

820
00:43:29,527 --> 00:43:33,489
the technical guy, the artistic guy, and the business guy.

821
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:39,113
And my studio is exactly the example

822
00:43:39,173 --> 00:43:41,755
you gave in blacking the business co-founder.

823
00:43:44,517 --> 00:43:46,619
What would the business co-founder

824
00:43:46,819 --> 00:43:51,402
do at the first one year of development of a game?

825
00:43:53,236 --> 00:43:58,901
I may be making a fool out of myself by this question, but I think that I'm okay with that.

826
00:44:00,042 --> 00:44:03,206
Yeah, listen, it's a great question.

827
00:44:03,666 --> 00:44:08,391
And that business person, and oftentimes...

828
00:44:09,532 --> 00:44:12,533
The business person may not actually have a business background.

829
00:44:12,553 --> 00:44:19,176
It could be another designer, programmer, the producer is taking on the business responsibility.

830
00:44:19,196 --> 00:44:24,338
So I'm not saying you got to go get an MBA student and like, okay, you're the business person, put a suit on.

831
00:44:24,378 --> 00:44:26,178
And so I should have said like.

832
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:29,881
someone taking on the role of the business leadership responsibility?

833
00:44:29,941 --> 00:44:33,884
I mean, ideally, they have some business background or marketing background.

834
00:44:34,584 --> 00:44:39,568
And so it's a great question because this sort of hints to the notion that you

835
00:44:39,648 --> 00:44:43,931
are not accepting yet or understanding yet that you are a fan-based building business.

836
00:44:44,871 --> 00:44:49,654
So that person not only has to start thinking about the branding of the company in the studio,

837
00:44:50,235 --> 00:44:52,837
already has to be thinking about the audience of the project,

838
00:44:53,117 --> 00:44:57,099
should already be doing competitive analysis before you even start coding,

839
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,681
and having that sort of debate amongst the teams,

840
00:44:59,701 --> 00:45:01,202
saying, well I think we're going to do a Ninja game.

841
00:45:01,502 --> 00:45:04,284
Alright, have we done a search and looked at Ninja games?

842
00:45:04,324 --> 00:45:07,506
Let's dig into the numbers and see what makes sense or not.

843
00:45:08,107 --> 00:45:12,410
Or you do a prototype, and so then they're gonna start running user group or

844
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:15,592
playtest nights to get real user input.

845
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:20,014
And then they're gonna go to the shows to talk to publishers and investors.

846
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:25,358
So that person is fundamental to the whole start of the business,

847
00:45:25,398 --> 00:45:28,180
the whole start of the company, and the whole start of the project, and

848
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,821
needs to be there from the start.

849
00:45:29,881 --> 00:45:32,943
It's not someone that you bring in two years later and say, okay,

850
00:45:32,983 --> 00:45:35,224
make some tweets and go market this thing.

851
00:45:36,185 --> 00:45:42,509
Because chances are that you've not made something that's relevant or marketable or doesn't have the right hooks to get you there

852
00:45:42,529 --> 00:45:45,691
So you need that person sort of arguing with you from the from the very beginning

853
00:45:46,552 --> 00:45:52,456
And just to be sure you do recommend that person to be not one of the other two like

854
00:45:52,976 --> 00:45:57,899
Taking on the role you do. Yeah, because it's like being a separate person because it's hard to argue with yourself

855
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,861
Because if fundamentally you're a designer,

856
00:46:01,141 --> 00:46:02,783
and then you're like, oh, I'll put the suit on

857
00:46:02,823 --> 00:46:04,424
from time to time, and then you're like,

858
00:46:04,444 --> 00:46:06,305
oh, we should make it this, we should put free to play,

859
00:46:06,325 --> 00:46:08,827
but no, let's make, like the designer in you

860
00:46:08,867 --> 00:46:10,368
will always win that argument.

861
00:46:11,429 --> 00:46:13,731
So there needs to be another person that sort of says,

862
00:46:13,751 --> 00:46:15,772
well, I'm gonna fight for what's viable

863
00:46:15,832 --> 00:46:17,814
and dig into the numbers and sort of,

864
00:46:18,574 --> 00:46:19,755
so it has to be someone else.

865
00:46:20,255 --> 00:46:20,756
Thank you very much.

866
00:46:20,776 --> 00:46:21,336
All right, thank you.

867
00:46:23,938 --> 00:46:24,338
Go ahead.

868
00:46:25,611 --> 00:46:27,934
Hi Jason, Mike Lynch from Rensselaer Polytech.

869
00:46:28,214 --> 00:46:28,995
Good to see you.

870
00:46:29,096 --> 00:46:29,897
Good to see you too.

871
00:46:30,517 --> 00:46:33,301
Question for people who are doing teaching.

872
00:46:33,621 --> 00:46:38,748
The schools I think are coming up really short on conveying these kinds of lessons to seniors

873
00:46:38,768 --> 00:46:40,911
who are about to go out there and maybe start a studio.

874
00:46:41,892 --> 00:46:47,976
What can schools be doing more to make that kind of mindset happen among game designers?

875
00:46:48,376 --> 00:46:55,461
Yeah, what wonderful wonderful question. So so I mean obviously academia is its own kind of complex system

876
00:46:56,341 --> 00:47:01,905
Ideally what I'd like to see is that schools that do have a kind of a senior or final project

877
00:47:02,365 --> 00:47:04,647
That the end goal of that project is to ship it

878
00:47:05,467 --> 00:47:07,309
I think they should actually go through that.

879
00:47:07,349 --> 00:47:08,630
Some schools might do that.

880
00:47:08,671 --> 00:47:09,611
I don't think many do.

881
00:47:09,631 --> 00:47:12,214
University of Indiana does, I just found out.

882
00:47:12,234 --> 00:47:13,936
Okay, so they're trying to put that in place.

883
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:16,238
That's a problem for us because it's infrastructural

884
00:47:16,378 --> 00:47:17,439
and resource bound.

885
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,761
There's copyright issues and whatever,

886
00:47:19,841 --> 00:47:22,304
but just the process of, a bit like Henry,

887
00:47:22,704 --> 00:47:24,566
where he said, oh, my goal was to learn and make estimates

888
00:47:24,606 --> 00:47:26,307
instead of go through the whole cycle and stuff.

889
00:47:26,327 --> 00:47:28,810
So I think actually having the students ship it

890
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:30,491
is an important learning step.

891
00:47:30,859 --> 00:47:34,381
But it's also the idea of including sessions on marketing,

892
00:47:34,421 --> 00:47:36,022
community management, entrepreneurship,

893
00:47:36,522 --> 00:47:39,163
and ideally, that's for all of the students,

894
00:47:39,783 --> 00:47:41,024
not just the ones that are taking

895
00:47:41,104 --> 00:47:42,345
sort of a marketing minor or something.

896
00:47:42,365 --> 00:47:44,846
It's like everyone in game development,

897
00:47:44,886 --> 00:47:46,047
game whatever in the school,

898
00:47:46,307 --> 00:47:48,087
should all be taking like a fundamentals

899
00:47:48,108 --> 00:47:50,489
of game economics and business and marketing.

900
00:47:50,509 --> 00:47:51,349
I think it would be a great approach.

901
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:51,809
Thank you very much.

902
00:47:51,829 --> 00:47:51,949
Yeah.

903
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:53,750
All right, next.

904
00:47:55,071 --> 00:47:55,131
Aye.

905
00:47:55,640 --> 00:48:01,665
Thanks for the talk. My name's Kyle, and I recently started an LLC by myself, so I know that's one thing I shouldn't be doing.

906
00:48:01,685 --> 00:48:05,548
But it depends what your goals are. It depends on how you define success.

907
00:48:05,888 --> 00:48:10,772
But in terms of my own skill set, I am a business person first. I'm probably the person that everyone hates.

908
00:48:10,792 --> 00:48:16,597
Like, yeah, I got this idea. But I have a little bit of technical expertise, and I have a little bit of creative expertise.

909
00:48:17,305 --> 00:48:19,547
And it seems like when you were talking about rule number one,

910
00:48:19,667 --> 00:48:21,448
it seems like everyone has predefined roles.

911
00:48:21,568 --> 00:48:23,289
One person does technical, one person does business,

912
00:48:23,349 --> 00:48:24,310
one person does creative.

913
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:27,652
Is there an opportunity for blended roles?

914
00:48:28,192 --> 00:48:30,173
And if there are blended roles, do you

915
00:48:30,193 --> 00:48:31,914
think there's different rules if you're

916
00:48:31,934 --> 00:48:34,596
starting a studio which has blended roles rather than

917
00:48:34,656 --> 00:48:35,176
defined roles?

918
00:48:37,759 --> 00:48:39,981
Yeah, I think blended roles is fine.

919
00:48:40,621 --> 00:48:43,124
And the reality is when you're a three-person studio

920
00:48:43,164 --> 00:48:45,926
just getting started, like everyone's doing some mixture

921
00:48:46,106 --> 00:48:47,567
of everything or things that they're not

922
00:48:47,767 --> 00:48:48,548
sort of trained to do.

923
00:48:50,309 --> 00:48:54,453
The main, it's more about, call it the arguments

924
00:48:54,493 --> 00:48:56,475
or the debates that the leadership has to have.

925
00:48:56,515 --> 00:48:59,197
It's less about on the ground, who's doing the coding

926
00:48:59,217 --> 00:49:00,358
and who's doing the art asset.

927
00:49:00,418 --> 00:49:01,779
Like I'm less concerned about that.

928
00:49:02,219 --> 00:49:07,686
It's more about when the founders are debating with each other what the road map should be,

929
00:49:08,026 --> 00:49:11,751
who our audience is and what kind of genres or platforms do we go after.

930
00:49:12,872 --> 00:49:17,678
When you have those debates, you need someone taking the perspective from a creative point of view,

931
00:49:18,178 --> 00:49:21,302
what's going to be beautiful, what's going to be interesting, what's going to make a great game.

932
00:49:21,582 --> 00:49:23,103
You need someone from the technical point of view

933
00:49:23,123 --> 00:49:24,844
who says, well, that may be interesting,

934
00:49:24,864 --> 00:49:26,185
but there's no way we can build that.

935
00:49:26,225 --> 00:49:27,626
Or Unreal doesn't support that yet.

936
00:49:27,666 --> 00:49:29,467
Or we need this tool that we can't afford.

937
00:49:29,827 --> 00:49:32,488
So they have to sort of fight from the technical perspective.

938
00:49:32,808 --> 00:49:35,750
And then you need the business person to fight, say, well,

939
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:38,251
that sounds crazy, but it's going to cost us $20 million.

940
00:49:38,271 --> 00:49:39,812
It's never going to work.

941
00:49:40,132 --> 00:49:43,794
So it's more about the tension and debate

942
00:49:43,994 --> 00:49:45,615
amongst those people when you're making

943
00:49:45,655 --> 00:49:49,397
those kind of high-level, company-level, vision-level

944
00:49:49,437 --> 00:49:49,978
decisions.

945
00:49:50,398 --> 00:49:51,098
It's less about.

946
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:54,541
we're sitting around doing the day-to-day work of making a game.

947
00:49:55,161 --> 00:49:58,464
I'm less concerned about the blendedness at that level.

948
00:49:58,484 --> 00:49:59,965
Okay. Thank you.

949
00:50:00,145 --> 00:50:02,787
Cool. Thanks. All right. Go ahead.

950
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,111
Hi. Thanks for the talk.

951
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:10,113
I have two questions, but I think we may have time.

952
00:50:11,814 --> 00:50:13,415
One, out of curiosity,

953
00:50:13,455 --> 00:50:17,098
what do you see as the role of agents in starting up a company?

954
00:50:17,158 --> 00:50:18,399
Is that something that you'd like to see,

955
00:50:18,439 --> 00:50:20,521
something that you don't like to see from an investment point of view?

956
00:50:20,852 --> 00:50:21,432
Are you an agent?

957
00:50:21,812 --> 00:50:21,932
No.

958
00:50:22,933 --> 00:50:23,993
Are there any agents in the room?

959
00:50:26,035 --> 00:50:27,575
Yeah, I mean, there are some agents

960
00:50:27,615 --> 00:50:31,478
that are great, super, super valuable, that

961
00:50:31,518 --> 00:50:33,619
have huge networks, and so on.

962
00:50:34,259 --> 00:50:36,881
And then other agents, which are maybe less reputable.

963
00:50:37,941 --> 00:50:39,382
But that's fairly common.

964
00:50:40,223 --> 00:50:42,825
I think ultimately depends what you're trying to achieve.

965
00:50:44,006 --> 00:50:48,130
And an agent is not really gonna help you build community

966
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,331
and worry about your fan base

967
00:50:49,351 --> 00:50:52,074
and make those hard decisions about what's competitive analysis

968
00:50:52,094 --> 00:50:52,654
all that kind of stuff.

969
00:50:54,076 --> 00:50:57,459
And if you want the agent to go after a publisher or investor,

970
00:50:57,479 --> 00:50:59,161
I mean, that's always a little bit tricky,

971
00:50:59,221 --> 00:51:01,403
but in the right context could help.

972
00:51:02,063 --> 00:51:03,244
And I think the issue is...

973
00:51:05,013 --> 00:51:06,895
you know, when you're sitting around saying,

974
00:51:06,915 --> 00:51:08,155
oh, we don't know anyone,

975
00:51:08,455 --> 00:51:09,956
and we don't know how to get a publisher,

976
00:51:10,016 --> 00:51:11,597
let's go ask an agent to help us.

977
00:51:11,617 --> 00:51:14,319
I mean, the agent vets you first,

978
00:51:14,819 --> 00:51:16,280
and they're trying to determine whether or not

979
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:19,061
they can sell you and sort of find a deal for you,

980
00:51:19,101 --> 00:51:19,581
and so on.

981
00:51:20,342 --> 00:51:26,464
And unless you're some rock star, have a huge track record, or the game has progressed far enough

982
00:51:26,964 --> 00:51:30,245
that it's something really beautiful or something really interesting or a huge opportunity,

983
00:51:30,646 --> 00:51:34,447
then the agent's not going to take you on anyways, or they shouldn't.

984
00:51:34,987 --> 00:51:38,268
I mean, it's like the joke about, like, I don't want to be part of a club,

985
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:39,929
any club that would have me as a member.

986
00:51:40,269 --> 00:51:41,329
So it's like a little bit of...

987
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:45,053
of that because the point where the agent looks at you and says,

988
00:51:45,374 --> 00:51:48,217
oh yeah, you've got something amazing, I'll represent you,

989
00:51:48,558 --> 00:51:51,441
that should be the very moment where you say, you know what, I think I'll represent

990
00:51:51,862 --> 00:51:54,965
myself. But that's, I mean, that's

991
00:51:55,246 --> 00:51:58,309
just me and sort of having confidence in what I do.

992
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:02,731
So oftentimes agents can be very powerful,

993
00:52:03,051 --> 00:52:05,092
but you really have to think about the context you're in,

994
00:52:05,172 --> 00:52:06,853
whether or not you need them,

995
00:52:07,073 --> 00:52:08,453
or whether they'll even take you on.

996
00:52:08,533 --> 00:52:11,274
So they're not always the quick fix.

997
00:52:13,069 --> 00:52:15,750
Okay, cool. And then just a second question.

998
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:18,510
I know a couple other people have also asked about it,

999
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:20,811
but is when you're looking at investing,

1000
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:22,591
is three really the Goldilocks number

1001
00:52:23,011 --> 00:52:24,931
in terms of just ownership in the company?

1002
00:52:25,011 --> 00:52:26,692
Like if there's like five or seven, you're like,

1003
00:52:27,292 --> 00:52:29,012
what is this socialist combine?

1004
00:52:29,452 --> 00:52:31,193
Versus if there's like a sole owner,

1005
00:52:31,233 --> 00:52:33,533
it's like, well, this guy's clearly just going to be a dictator.

1006
00:52:34,833 --> 00:52:39,614
If there is a group that has a more diverse ownership group,

1007
00:52:39,654 --> 00:52:40,715
they still have the clear like...

1008
00:52:41,235 --> 00:52:42,896
We have one person leading the business,

1009
00:52:43,016 --> 00:52:44,156
one person leading the creative,

1010
00:52:44,196 --> 00:52:45,297
and one person leading the tech.

1011
00:52:45,437 --> 00:52:46,218
Is that okay?

1012
00:52:47,278 --> 00:52:51,581
Yeah, I mean, so, another great, great question.

1013
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:55,463
I mean, yeah, three is kind of the Goldilocks number.

1014
00:52:56,123 --> 00:52:57,824
Two tends to be too few,

1015
00:52:57,844 --> 00:53:01,627
and then you don't have this sort of this,

1016
00:53:01,647 --> 00:53:03,988
like the balance of the triangle in sort of those fights.

1017
00:53:05,729 --> 00:53:12,336
One is definitely a red flag in that many investors will not back a solo entrepreneur

1018
00:53:12,456 --> 00:53:17,301
just because there's so much burden, so much work, that's just like it's a Herculean effort

1019
00:53:18,182 --> 00:53:18,502
alone.

1020
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:22,145
I mean, publishers, it's a different story because they're not investing in the company.

1021
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:24,308
They're just like, hey, can your team deliver the project?

1022
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:25,549
And so it's a different discussion.

1023
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:30,213
I mean if it's four founders or five, I mean it's fine.

1024
00:53:30,614 --> 00:53:32,956
What tends to happen is the more founders you have,

1025
00:53:33,236 --> 00:53:35,538
the smaller the slice of ownership of each founder.

1026
00:53:35,558 --> 00:53:38,822
And so the cap table, the capitalization table

1027
00:53:38,862 --> 00:53:39,803
gets quite messy.

1028
00:53:39,823 --> 00:53:41,985
And then if you took some money from your uncle

1029
00:53:42,025 --> 00:53:43,646
and he's sitting on there and you know, whatever.

1030
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:51,136
The main thing the investor wants to see is that the founding team still own a significant portion of the company

1031
00:53:51,416 --> 00:53:56,222
such that you're motivated to put in the blood, sweat, and tears to make the company succeed.

1032
00:53:56,583 --> 00:54:00,167
And if each of you owns, you know, one-eighteenth of the company...

1033
00:54:01,208 --> 00:54:07,052
Then really how committed is each of the founders and so on I mean I like like that's in my response

1034
00:54:07,092 --> 00:54:12,116
There's in a very traditional business sense and certainly we're starting to see other

1035
00:54:12,156 --> 00:54:15,798
Implementations like I think there's a lecture. I don't know if was yesterday about like a

1036
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:20,161
Collective like a like an employee owned collective

1037
00:54:20,562 --> 00:54:26,726
But that's a completely different structure and that's tuned for their success to have a more sort of democratic, you know employee led

1038
00:54:27,476 --> 00:54:33,057
And that's beautiful, but also they will never ever get VC money because it's incompatible

1039
00:54:33,657 --> 00:54:34,437
with that structure.

1040
00:54:34,697 --> 00:54:36,798
But my guess is they would never even ask for it.

1041
00:54:36,818 --> 00:54:41,339
They're just on a different path, and so that different structure was suitable for their

1042
00:54:41,379 --> 00:54:42,279
definition of success.

1043
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:46,020
Whereas if you do think you want to build a business and take on investors, et cetera,

1044
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:51,121
then you're playing by the more traditional rules, and you don't want to have 25 co-founders

1045
00:54:51,141 --> 00:54:51,481
each owning 125.

1046
00:54:56,342 --> 00:54:58,124
It looks weird when I look at that cap table.

1047
00:54:58,144 --> 00:55:01,425
I wanna see that you and the other two co-founders each own

1048
00:55:01,766 --> 00:55:04,687
a significant portion so that you're gonna go to hell and

1049
00:55:04,707 --> 00:55:06,809
back and this is gonna succeed and you're committed and

1050
00:55:06,829 --> 00:55:08,590
you have skin in the game and so on.

1051
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:09,610
Yeah.

1052
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:10,191
All right, thank you.

1053
00:55:11,011 --> 00:55:12,352
All right, another question.

1054
00:55:13,353 --> 00:55:14,974
Thanks for the talk, Jason, appreciate it.

1055
00:55:15,274 --> 00:55:18,956
So traditionally, in that sort of structure you're talking

1056
00:55:18,976 --> 00:55:20,577
about where you have three co-founders, but

1057
00:55:20,737 --> 00:55:22,238
usually there's one that's really strong,

1058
00:55:22,278 --> 00:55:24,299
like a strong personality, right?

1059
00:55:24,715 --> 00:55:24,816
Oh.

1060
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:25,476
Or no?

1061
00:55:25,796 --> 00:55:26,397
Not so much?

1062
00:55:26,577 --> 00:55:26,937
Maybe.

1063
00:55:27,037 --> 00:55:27,377
Maybe?

1064
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:33,582
So I guess that's the question is what has been your findings as far as like the balance

1065
00:55:33,622 --> 00:55:34,823
of personalities, the balance of...

1066
00:55:34,843 --> 00:55:40,547
Yeah, I mean now we're getting into sort of, you know, I can tell you endless stories about

1067
00:55:40,827 --> 00:55:45,590
sort of the interpersonal dynamics of the co-founders and where it's been amazing and

1068
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:47,332
where it's been very sort of toxic.

1069
00:55:48,292 --> 00:55:52,315
I mean I think the idea is that the co-founders are in relatively equal footing.

1070
00:55:52,795 --> 00:55:56,257
So that when you're having these debates about the future and vision and so on,

1071
00:55:56,537 --> 00:56:00,319
that it's not just one person that says, well, I'm the star here, so you shut up.

1072
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:04,702
And we're gonna do it my way, because then now you have that more dictatorship

1073
00:56:04,802 --> 00:56:05,082
model.

1074
00:56:06,202 --> 00:56:10,184
So this goes back to the notion of finding your co-founders first,

1075
00:56:11,205 --> 00:56:14,327
in that you really, I mean, this is a marriage, and you wanna find the people

1076
00:56:14,387 --> 00:56:16,768
that, at a personality level, you combine with.

1077
00:56:17,481 --> 00:56:19,583
at a skills level, you're complimentary,

1078
00:56:20,264 --> 00:56:22,446
and that you feel like you can actually rely on each other

1079
00:56:22,466 --> 00:56:24,529
and trust each other and build a company together.

1080
00:56:24,949 --> 00:56:27,932
And it's not just my buddy or my brother or whatever.

1081
00:56:27,972 --> 00:56:31,175
It's I'm really being deliberate about finding those people.

1082
00:56:31,195 --> 00:56:32,417
And it's not easy.

1083
00:56:32,457 --> 00:56:34,639
It's not easy to find those kinds of people

1084
00:56:34,679 --> 00:56:37,442
that sort of plug in nicely to make that co-founding team.

1085
00:56:38,483 --> 00:56:43,187
And I've seen it where one person is sort of a little more toxic, but they were buddies in high school,

1086
00:56:43,267 --> 00:56:47,491
so they kind of do it anyways, and then you're like five years in and one's trying to buy the other one out,

1087
00:56:47,511 --> 00:56:50,554
and the other one's trying to sue the other, and it's just a nightmare.

1088
00:56:50,594 --> 00:56:55,298
So that really goes back to like, find the co-founders first before that.

1089
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:57,200
But yeah, I don't know.

1090
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:02,404
See a counselor if you're having sort of intermarital issues and stuff.

1091
00:57:04,063 --> 00:57:06,865
All right, well I guess we're mostly out of time.

1092
00:57:07,245 --> 00:57:07,946
Thank you everyone.

1093
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:09,807
I hope you go up there and eat a lot of broccoli.

1094
00:57:10,368 --> 00:57:11,308
Enjoy the rest of the show,

1095
00:57:11,349 --> 00:57:12,790
and fill out your surveys, please.
