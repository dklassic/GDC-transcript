1
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:06,406
Thanks for coming.

2
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:11,588
Thanks for giving me a reason to escape our little paper

3
00:00:11,608 --> 00:00:13,648
world for a few hours.

4
00:00:13,908 --> 00:00:15,829
I'm enjoying seeing some different textures here.

5
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:17,670
I'm quite inspired by this.

6
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:22,011
But today, we're just going to talk about paper and building

7
00:00:22,071 --> 00:00:25,032
a world out of paper, a very touchy, feely world.

8
00:00:26,035 --> 00:00:27,935
Let's just move this on.

9
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:28,555
There's me.

10
00:00:28,575 --> 00:00:30,756
There's my Twitter handle.

11
00:00:30,776 --> 00:00:32,777
I doubt that we'll have time to do questions,

12
00:00:32,817 --> 00:00:35,477
so you can always ping me a few questions afterwards

13
00:00:35,897 --> 00:00:36,578
if you've got any.

14
00:00:37,418 --> 00:00:44,080
Well, hopefully you've heard of Tearaway already.

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,601
But if you haven't, you should have a good understanding

16
00:00:48,661 --> 00:00:52,042
of what we've been building the last couple of years.

17
00:00:55,172 --> 00:00:58,856
So I've been personally with MM since the beginning,

18
00:01:00,497 --> 00:01:05,403
working on the visual design of the company and its games,

19
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:09,988
the playful anarchy of how they've come together.

20
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:19,187
Visually and having some kind of influence on some of the music and directing the intros and just giving it that molecule

21
00:01:19,267 --> 00:01:21,509
atmosphere. And now I'm lead

22
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:28,216
lead creator on Tearaway, a smaller subject subset of the MM team

23
00:01:28,316 --> 00:01:34,282
concentrating on making something very adventurous and and portable for the PlayStation Vita.

24
00:01:36,535 --> 00:01:39,158
So in case you haven't seen what we're doing,

25
00:01:39,198 --> 00:01:42,380
I'm just going to do a little recap on the trailer

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,721
that we released last summer.

27
00:01:44,222 --> 00:01:46,003
And it gives a little bit of context

28
00:01:46,204 --> 00:01:47,625
on what I'll be talking about.

29
00:01:47,645 --> 00:01:48,726
Because otherwise, you might be wondering

30
00:01:48,766 --> 00:01:52,489
why I'm talking about giant fingertips and paper world.

31
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,310
So here we go.

32
00:02:07,663 --> 00:02:10,544
You should've gone a better bet Better for your head

33
00:02:10,844 --> 00:02:12,465
Better heads meet short tie

34
00:02:13,005 --> 00:02:19,927
You should've gone a better bet Better for your head

35
00:02:20,027 --> 00:02:22,408
Better heads meet short tie

36
00:02:22,828 --> 00:02:25,068
You should've gone a..

37
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:25,949
ARRRR!

38
00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:28,989
Better for your head

39
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:32,610
Better for your head,

40
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:33,511
And see,

41
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:34,711
promise it to me

42
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:36,071
Promise we have a seat

43
00:03:27,968 --> 00:03:29,531
Fin, I hate you so much.

44
00:03:29,551 --> 00:03:30,493
I'll never play the game again!

45
00:03:30,553 --> 00:03:30,894
I'm gonna...

46
00:03:30,914 --> 00:03:31,315
I'm gonna die.

47
00:03:31,335 --> 00:03:32,557
I'll never play the game again.

48
00:03:32,597 --> 00:03:39,212
DinDinPearly.exe has stopped communicating

49
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:56,570
Thanks very much.

50
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,752
So I'm going to start off by saying this.

51
00:04:26,031 --> 00:04:29,675
I'm going to start off by saying this, I don't like digital things.

52
00:04:30,756 --> 00:04:34,040
At least, I don't really like things that react in a digital way.

53
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,866
I like things that you can really see the hand of someone else in the creation of that thing.

54
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:44,090
And something that you can really feel it in your own hands, very tangible.

55
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:48,993
Now, my first experience with game design was with MUDs.

56
00:04:50,993 --> 00:04:52,854
Not that kind of MUDs, this kind of MUDs.

57
00:04:54,055 --> 00:04:57,596
I grew up in a very rural area and just mainly sort of played

58
00:04:57,636 --> 00:05:02,278
around with making games myself out of whatever I could lay my

59
00:05:02,298 --> 00:05:05,759
hands on, just making up my own rules and just getting messy

60
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,579
and getting hurt.

61
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:17,442
And I think we all enjoy returning to a childlike kind of playing around of materials, identifying their unique properties,

62
00:05:18,222 --> 00:05:21,323
how they react to you and how they react when combined together.

63
00:05:21,963 --> 00:05:27,885
Kind of things that leave a mark, not just on what you're playing with, but on you.

64
00:05:29,285 --> 00:05:35,667
And I think a lot of that came through in LBP, the sort of playful making, the cut and paste, the doodle and sculpting.

65
00:05:36,815 --> 00:05:41,243
Experimenting with what happens when you combine materials together and throw them around.

66
00:05:41,263 --> 00:05:41,303
So...

67
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:45,932
When we were handed a Vita, on the surface,

68
00:05:46,573 --> 00:05:48,054
it seemed like the complete opposite of that.

69
00:05:48,434 --> 00:05:51,816
It's very clean, very sleek, very shiny.

70
00:05:52,896 --> 00:05:54,337
Not exactly a bucket of mud.

71
00:05:55,758 --> 00:05:57,159
But it's covered in inputs.

72
00:05:57,719 --> 00:05:58,720
You hold it in your hands.

73
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,261
It's a personal experience.

74
00:06:01,141 --> 00:06:04,023
So perhaps we could use it in a way

75
00:06:04,103 --> 00:06:07,165
to create some kind of tactile, messy world

76
00:06:07,205 --> 00:06:08,065
that you are holding.

77
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,042
And that was the real jumping off point, that it is held by your fingers.

78
00:06:14,743 --> 00:06:19,006
I've played a load of games, I've pressed all these buttons a million times,

79
00:06:19,406 --> 00:06:23,008
and the games have never really commented on the fact that I'm pressing these buttons,

80
00:06:23,368 --> 00:06:28,351
and what are my fingers and my thumbs doing? Do they have a part in these stories?

81
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:35,354
Do video games like, you know, sort of, are the boss characters sort of living in fear of your thumbs?

82
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:40,356
You know, these terrible whirling beasts that are outside of their world, like, controlling their destiny.

83
00:06:41,517 --> 00:06:47,299
So maybe that we could play a little bit more with the idea of what a game is and what it means to

84
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:48,380
hold it and to play it.

85
00:06:50,676 --> 00:07:01,003
And we started coming around to this idea of creating a more playful intersection between the game world and the real world.

86
00:07:02,604 --> 00:07:05,967
A lot of that came from the excitement of the Vita's rear touch panel.

87
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:13,592
And if you could actually see your fingers, like, in the game world, it would kind of genuinely feel handheld and...

88
00:07:14,113 --> 00:07:16,437
and kind of immediately more engaging.

89
00:07:17,278 --> 00:07:20,404
And that was kind of the first element of

90
00:07:20,745 --> 00:07:22,568
just trying to break down this fourth wall

91
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,273
between a game and reality.

92
00:07:27,242 --> 00:07:32,367
We started to concept and prototype various finger puppet characters.

93
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:39,053
At this stage, we were experimenting with making your fingers the main characters in

94
00:07:39,073 --> 00:07:44,337
the game, something that we iterated a lot on and ultimately ended up implementing in

95
00:07:44,377 --> 00:07:47,820
a slightly different way, which is a whole separate talk.

96
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,704
But if we were going to make a world that you...

97
00:07:53,263 --> 00:07:54,925
that you'll go push your fingers into,

98
00:07:55,305 --> 00:07:57,526
then obviously we'd need to make something

99
00:07:57,566 --> 00:07:59,568
that you'd want to push your fingers into.

100
00:08:00,928 --> 00:08:03,290
This particular scene from Flash Gordon

101
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,652
has traumatized me since I was very young.

102
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:09,734
Particularly anyone in the UK,

103
00:08:09,774 --> 00:08:12,216
that actor was the number one

104
00:08:12,256 --> 00:08:14,337
sort of children's TV presenter at the time,

105
00:08:14,397 --> 00:08:16,739
so seeing him do that was horrible.

106
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,422
So a lot of game universes, they look really amazing,

107
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:26,024
but they're not something that you necessarily would want to touch.

108
00:08:26,064 --> 00:08:29,526
You'd be sort of putting your fingers in and touching someone's eyeball

109
00:08:29,606 --> 00:08:31,787
or a spike pit or something like that.

110
00:08:33,743 --> 00:08:36,006
We really needed a world that could do all of these things.

111
00:08:38,148 --> 00:08:43,213
And my particular personal style is distinctive shapes

112
00:08:43,313 --> 00:08:48,439
and silhouettes, a look that can be diluted when trying to do

113
00:08:48,499 --> 00:08:51,201
that in a full, more conventional, 3D way.

114
00:08:53,443 --> 00:08:59,829
It took us a little while to work out where to get the influence from that would really just combine all of these things together.

115
00:08:59,849 --> 00:09:01,551
And it came from our desks.

116
00:09:02,712 --> 00:09:07,056
That's my desk. You might be able to make out a couple of computers in there somewhere.

117
00:09:09,038 --> 00:09:10,199
Not very popular with the cleaners.

118
00:09:12,277 --> 00:09:15,679
And it just seemed like the perfect material,

119
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,001
as we were kind of screwing up our concept art

120
00:09:18,021 --> 00:09:20,102
and throwing it around and abandoning it.

121
00:09:20,162 --> 00:09:22,083
We just started to create landscapes

122
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,725
without even sort of thinking about it.

123
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:29,267
And it's a material that's kind of seldom celebrated.

124
00:09:30,108 --> 00:09:31,529
It's usually a negative term.

125
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:34,971
We talk about paper thin or paperwork.

126
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,772
We thought, let's have some paper play.

127
00:09:38,106 --> 00:09:44,493
It's tactile and creative. It's kind of under threat a little bit from from e-readers and all the digital stuff.

128
00:09:45,734 --> 00:09:51,821
I kind of don't really feel that in the future someone's going to make a game out of Kindles, but who knows?

129
00:09:54,864 --> 00:09:58,345
So, I think this statement is kind of true,

130
00:09:59,746 --> 00:10:02,827
except that it's very easy to think that paper craft is low poly,

131
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:05,749
and it's not low poly at all. It curves, it flexes,

132
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:08,610
it needs to have a lot more simulation under the surface.

133
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,091
It's all of these things that make it interesting,

134
00:10:12,632 --> 00:10:14,993
the imperfections, the limitations, and the movement.

135
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,695
So this is our first test render.

136
00:10:19,095 --> 00:10:21,077
Had this sort of miniaturization feel.

137
00:10:21,517 --> 00:10:23,299
But you can't really see the imperfections.

138
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:25,601
And also, it was trying to do two things at once.

139
00:10:26,062 --> 00:10:28,604
It's carefully painted and made of paper, but it didn't

140
00:10:28,744 --> 00:10:31,306
really strongly look like either of them.

141
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:40,930
And then this is our first prototype. It's very simple, isometric look. The floor was kind of interestingly tactile.

142
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:44,531
We're not very papery and the finger doesn't really look anything like a finger.

143
00:10:45,752 --> 00:10:52,654
But there was kind of some interesting stuff happening with the real world game world interception. I'll start playing it so you can see.

144
00:11:06,857 --> 00:11:09,959
See how you use the rear touch to cut things out,

145
00:11:09,979 --> 00:11:11,580
and then they fall out into the real world.

146
00:11:12,601 --> 00:11:14,542
Something that traveled through into the final game

147
00:11:14,582 --> 00:11:16,143
in a very different implementation.

148
00:11:18,346 --> 00:11:26,008
But we needed to go bolder, have more contrast with the finger, just be more easily identified from a glance.

149
00:11:26,448 --> 00:11:31,950
So we just stripped out all the texturing, so far back that we've actually only got one texture in the game.

150
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:39,392
This is an abstract concept from the time, the sort of opposite of the boxy isometric prototypes.

151
00:11:40,192 --> 00:11:45,774
We really wanted to stay as true as possible to the material and the limitations of the construction.

152
00:11:47,992 --> 00:11:50,592
And by designing and building and remaking and paper

153
00:11:50,892 --> 00:11:52,153
and repeating the process, we were

154
00:11:52,193 --> 00:11:54,013
able to get something much more handmade.

155
00:11:54,453 --> 00:11:56,634
All the imperfections appeared.

156
00:11:57,414 --> 00:11:58,994
The limitations in the material meant

157
00:11:59,034 --> 00:12:02,055
that we had to redesign some things that were more

158
00:12:02,095 --> 00:12:03,975
ingenious in their construction.

159
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:07,336
And the way they were folded and formed

160
00:12:07,836 --> 00:12:11,097
suggests certain types of animation and movement.

161
00:12:14,223 --> 00:12:17,885
This is a concept video from the time with the aim of just

162
00:12:18,265 --> 00:12:21,267
resetting our brains a little bit about the kind of gameplay

163
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:24,309
interactions you can have in this paper world, so that it's

164
00:12:24,349 --> 00:12:28,131
not just a re-skinning of traditional game language.

165
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,573
It doesn't really make sense to have a spike

166
00:12:31,633 --> 00:12:32,794
pit in a paper world.

167
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:10,234
So paper just became the whole ethos behind the game,

168
00:13:10,494 --> 00:13:11,595
not just an art style.

169
00:13:12,035 --> 00:13:14,798
It needed to be the way that everything was constructed,

170
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:16,959
the way it moved, the way you interacted with it,

171
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,281
and just not work it with any other material.

172
00:13:20,979 --> 00:13:23,580
And by restricting ourselves to just this one material,

173
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,321
we had to just think a little bit differently.

174
00:13:25,982 --> 00:13:28,223
There's no, like I was kind of alluding to earlier,

175
00:13:28,243 --> 00:13:30,324
there's no real point to having an ice level

176
00:13:30,404 --> 00:13:33,746
or the usual fiery lava level in a paper world

177
00:13:33,966 --> 00:13:35,407
kind of annihilate the entire world

178
00:13:35,467 --> 00:13:36,848
if you even put a single match in.

179
00:13:36,948 --> 00:13:41,551
So the limitations really gave us some focus.

180
00:13:42,471 --> 00:13:45,013
It just meant that we could work on an engine

181
00:13:45,053 --> 00:13:46,534
that just simulated that one thing

182
00:13:46,574 --> 00:13:47,754
and just did it really well.

183
00:13:48,609 --> 00:13:52,650
I'm talking of which, here's a little glimpse into our paper engine.

184
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:58,871
So here I can just step through, I can see it down there.

185
00:13:58,951 --> 00:13:59,952
So drawing out a sheet,

186
00:14:00,852 --> 00:14:01,912
start building a world,

187
00:14:04,213 --> 00:14:04,613
put some

188
00:14:05,653 --> 00:14:08,474
some tears in it, see those traveling around.

189
00:14:08,494 --> 00:14:15,396
I think it's often, it's not the actual paper texture, but it's more the fact that the edges are a little bit wobbly and

190
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:20,761
As I was moving as well, you can see how it's got a little bit of noise on it, so it's all jittering around.

191
00:14:20,781 --> 00:14:28,927
And we can peel bits up and make essentially more three-dimensional shapes.

192
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,329
Here's another one.

193
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:36,072
This one's a little bit more structural, so we put the sheet down.

194
00:14:36,092 --> 00:14:40,275
But this time, we start giving it some form, giving it some height.

195
00:14:41,078 --> 00:14:43,480
And you can see the tabs automatically being added.

196
00:14:44,461 --> 00:14:45,761
But it's not actually a solid cube,

197
00:14:45,821 --> 00:14:47,462
it's just made out of a single sheet of paper

198
00:14:47,502 --> 00:14:49,824
that's had all the folds put in for us.

199
00:14:51,005 --> 00:14:53,746
That debug view shows the plan view

200
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:55,367
of the shape on the floor,

201
00:14:56,288 --> 00:14:59,470
just so you can kind of get a grasp of what's going on.

202
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:03,872
And then as I change the kind of

203
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:11,510
The angle of the walls, you can see how the plan view is updating so that you could actually print that out if you wanted to.

204
00:15:14,251 --> 00:15:17,232
You can just keep going on till you made a really stupid face.

205
00:15:20,092 --> 00:15:22,573
Right, stick enough of those together you end up with a world.

206
00:15:22,593 --> 00:15:28,735
A fantasy world, realistically created is how I really like to think about it.

207
00:15:31,268 --> 00:15:34,150
And this world is all based on natural forms

208
00:15:35,031 --> 00:15:37,593
infused with a feeling of folklore.

209
00:15:38,414 --> 00:15:42,497
Mainly because it's a lot more interesting to make a natural world out of paper.

210
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:45,640
You know we could we could make an urban cityscape,

211
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:52,285
but we've just been making boxes whereas trying to design a tree or trying to you know get that kind of more curvaceous

212
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,147
feeling is just way more interesting.

213
00:15:56,944 --> 00:16:00,487
You can see there's like hardly a single straight edge in any of those shots.

214
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:08,372
But it doesn't matter how papery the construction of the world is if it's not responding,

215
00:16:08,812 --> 00:16:11,874
if it's not moving or responding, it's not going to feel papery.

216
00:16:13,075 --> 00:16:13,375
So,

217
00:16:14,376 --> 00:16:19,459
that realism of the construction really helped with our goal of just making it feel really touchy feeling,

218
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:26,404
because the simulation required in building it would mean that it could also react in a simulated way.

219
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:32,854
So here's a mesmerizing example of Iota running around

220
00:16:32,894 --> 00:16:33,415
in a circle.

221
00:16:33,475 --> 00:16:35,557
And you can see how, I could watch this all day,

222
00:16:36,858 --> 00:16:39,801
how the paper's just squashing up and down.

223
00:16:39,821 --> 00:16:41,042
It makes me so happy.

224
00:16:41,522 --> 00:16:45,266
And it's just like guiding the character,

225
00:16:45,286 --> 00:16:46,747
sort of pulling you through the world.

226
00:16:46,767 --> 00:16:48,729
You just want to run along the edges of things.

227
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:50,831
Here's a slightly different example.

228
00:16:51,691 --> 00:16:52,492
Jumpies and puddles.

229
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,669
You know, just making jumping in puddles really fun to do.

230
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:00,152
Take another step through the world, go on the adventure.

231
00:17:01,838 --> 00:17:08,842
A slightly more dramatic version from the trailer is just the way that, you know, you can use the fingers to

232
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,624
push up through the world and have it reacting.

233
00:17:13,726 --> 00:17:15,747
And I don't know if you can see around the finger,

234
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:22,051
it's also showing using the rear camera of the Vita that you see through into reality.

235
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:24,893
So we've got this mad sort of

236
00:17:25,573 --> 00:17:28,075
intersection of game world and real world.

237
00:17:29,811 --> 00:17:32,396
A few more examples, but you will have seen those in the trailer.

238
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:39,672
So the way we try and bring the world to life

239
00:17:39,712 --> 00:17:42,133
really breaks down into simulation and animation.

240
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:45,095
Simulation for the things that you're doing as a human,

241
00:17:45,135 --> 00:17:47,856
this sort of godlike force that's holding the Vita

242
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,337
and interacting with it.

243
00:17:50,218 --> 00:17:53,679
And then we have a different kind of overtly animated style

244
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,541
for how the world is reacting to you influencing it.

245
00:17:57,942 --> 00:18:00,543
Kind of think of it more as like real and magical really.

246
00:18:01,223 --> 00:18:02,404
So the animation.

247
00:18:03,869 --> 00:18:05,932
We're going for a kind of stop-motion style

248
00:18:06,393 --> 00:18:08,356
to just kind of remind you of the fact

249
00:18:08,396 --> 00:18:10,579
that it is moving of its own accord.

250
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:13,284
This doesn't normally happen to a sheet of paper

251
00:18:13,364 --> 00:18:14,165
sitting on your desk.

252
00:18:15,087 --> 00:18:17,731
So it just makes it more characterful, more interesting,

253
00:18:17,771 --> 00:18:18,853
kind of more real than real.

254
00:18:20,938 --> 00:18:27,422
Our technical artist, Stefan, has written loads of custom stuff so that we can simulate bits of paper moving around.

255
00:18:27,442 --> 00:18:33,285
This is a first ever test of the main character. That's actually just their leg.

256
00:18:34,006 --> 00:18:41,350
We wanted to make sure, you know, their leg could do really characterful and interesting ways. It's bending and, well, not stretching. Paper doesn't stretch, but

257
00:18:42,811 --> 00:18:45,232
you know, all that kind of different transformations.

258
00:18:47,234 --> 00:18:49,855
A few more examples here of the stop-motion look.

259
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,466
This is our motion capture studio.

260
00:19:03,427 --> 00:19:05,768
We do our animation in a stationary cupboard.

261
00:19:05,968 --> 00:19:06,768
Get the irony.

262
00:19:10,369 --> 00:19:15,731
And we want to make sure that the characters, I'll just set our animator going, we want

263
00:19:15,751 --> 00:19:17,972
to make sure that our characters do have personality.

264
00:19:18,712 --> 00:19:19,613
They're made of paper.

265
00:19:19,633 --> 00:19:22,534
It's doing terrible things, the sap boy.

266
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:28,425
I want to make sure that their personalities and their emotions fully bring them to life

267
00:19:28,545 --> 00:19:33,171
so that we don't just end up with folded bits of paper with eyes stuck onto them.

268
00:19:33,191 --> 00:19:38,918
We don't want to just celebrate the medium of paper, but really convey some messages

269
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:39,219
with it.

270
00:19:41,538 --> 00:19:44,139
And the final reason for building a world out of paper

271
00:19:44,459 --> 00:19:47,061
is so players can get involved themselves

272
00:19:47,981 --> 00:19:52,423
and really extend that intersection of game world

273
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:55,845
and real world and take stuff outside of the game.

274
00:19:58,386 --> 00:20:00,828
So although we're building a world that's

275
00:20:00,848 --> 00:20:06,230
very, very personal to us and learning the skills that we

276
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,812
need to build a relatively cohesive adventure,

277
00:20:11,852 --> 00:20:18,295
Crafting with paper is just a way that we can make sure that all players can really get involved with

278
00:20:19,976 --> 00:20:22,277
this world, whether it's customizing

279
00:20:23,017 --> 00:20:26,759
in-game elements like this particularly demanding squirrel or

280
00:20:27,579 --> 00:20:31,220
Being rewarded with plans to print out and make,

281
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,981
kind of like digital, I mean non-digital, physical trophies,

282
00:20:37,061 --> 00:20:38,242
kind of way more personal.

283
00:20:39,862 --> 00:20:44,463
I've kind of found it's pretty hard not to pick up a little paper craft elk

284
00:20:44,623 --> 00:20:46,104
once it's sitting on a desk near you.

285
00:20:47,424 --> 00:20:50,125
I'm predicting that 2D printers are going to be the next big thing.

286
00:20:54,111 --> 00:21:00,256
And ultimately it just gives us a way for players to have fun

287
00:21:01,236 --> 00:21:02,437
adding to what's already there.

288
00:21:02,738 --> 00:21:06,561
Break down that fourth wall and bring elements of the game world into their own lives.

289
00:21:06,901 --> 00:21:12,165
Here's some examples of what people have been doing in a recent thing we got fans involved with.

290
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:19,947
And just find things in the paper world, customize them, print them out in the real world, take photos of their collections,

291
00:21:20,327 --> 00:21:23,948
invent new games using them, or just feed them back into the game again.

292
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:30,569
And basically just have lots of lots of creative fun. Remember why we play games in the first place.

293
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,590
Splashing some puddles, make some mess,

294
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:37,131
terrify their teachers.

295
00:21:40,154 --> 00:21:48,388
So just wrapping up, that's how we got to where we are, how and maybe most importantly

296
00:21:48,488 --> 00:21:53,917
why we decided to focus on one material to make our touchy-feely adventure.

297
00:21:58,945 --> 00:22:02,768
By having paper run through the entire decision process,

298
00:22:03,168 --> 00:22:04,989
it's really helped us focus on a core,

299
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:08,471
make sure that the tech would allow it to happen,

300
00:22:08,872 --> 00:22:12,754
and really concentrate on doing that one thing really well.

301
00:22:14,243 --> 00:22:17,125
And then there's the freedom of the limitation.

302
00:22:17,506 --> 00:22:18,587
It's just one material.

303
00:22:19,587 --> 00:22:22,049
We needed to come up with new ways to interact with it

304
00:22:22,129 --> 00:22:25,472
and travel through the world and reset our brains.

305
00:22:25,572 --> 00:22:28,415
And we spent a long time on LBP, and we

306
00:22:28,435 --> 00:22:31,357
didn't want to just fall back on some of the older ideas.

307
00:22:32,238 --> 00:22:33,419
And also, it's fun.

308
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,601
It's a pretty mad thing to do, too.

309
00:22:35,998 --> 00:22:38,160
Try and build a world out of sheets of craft paper.

310
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,363
Make it move and react in ways that you'd expect

311
00:22:41,463 --> 00:22:42,444
and some you wouldn't.

312
00:22:43,265 --> 00:22:44,426
But it's been a fun challenge,

313
00:22:45,127 --> 00:22:48,150
especially when we see what fans are starting to do

314
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,774
with taking stuff out and building things themselves.

315
00:22:54,116 --> 00:22:54,697
Thank you very much.

316
00:23:06,239 --> 00:23:08,561
I don't know if I have time for any questions.

317
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,122
I've got like 30 seconds apparently.

318
00:23:13,284 --> 00:23:13,824
Any quick ones?

319
00:23:13,944 --> 00:23:14,124
No?

320
00:23:18,187 --> 00:23:20,489
Any chance for some felt DLC?

321
00:23:20,889 --> 00:23:21,590
Some felt?

322
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,031
I like it.

323
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:23,891
Maybe.

324
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:29,598
With the paper tearing, how did you explore it and kind of arrive at the look you had

325
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:33,860
for the edges of the paper as the world was built and torn and all the little bits you

326
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,682
have that kind of describe the kind of inside of the paper underneath the color that you

327
00:23:37,722 --> 00:23:43,344
have on a lot of the paper edges to get that kind of texture to be there versus it just

328
00:23:43,384 --> 00:23:46,726
being a hard edge of a cut piece of paper, that kind of that torn?

329
00:23:47,779 --> 00:23:55,425
Oh, so the torn edging is applied as a separate texture that gets mapped around the edge of

330
00:23:55,785 --> 00:23:58,167
the paper as it comes apart.

331
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:00,328
Right, it's brilliant, yeah.

332
00:24:00,769 --> 00:24:01,089
Thank you.

333
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:03,571
I think that might be it.

334
00:24:03,591 --> 00:24:05,172
Okay, thanks everyone.

335
00:24:19,628 --> 00:24:20,611
Oh my god, let's get dry.

336
00:24:20,671 --> 00:24:21,493
Oh, that's still on.

337
00:24:22,557 --> 00:24:22,998
Let's get dry!
