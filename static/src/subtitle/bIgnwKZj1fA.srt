1
00:00:02,296 --> 00:00:02,841
last day of GDC.

2
00:00:05,893 --> 00:00:08,834
This is my 21st consecutive GDC.

3
00:00:08,934 --> 00:00:12,475
So yeah, a great fun week.

4
00:00:12,515 --> 00:00:15,736
And it seems that every GDC is crazier than the next.

5
00:00:16,376 --> 00:00:17,017
So I'm Jason.

6
00:00:17,037 --> 00:00:19,437
I'm the co-founder of Execution Labs.

7
00:00:20,598 --> 00:00:25,039
Execution Labs is a early stage investor in game studio.

8
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:26,480
So we are an equity investor.

9
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,861
We become partners with the companies we invest in,

10
00:00:30,621 --> 00:00:31,622
long-term partners.

11
00:00:32,402 --> 00:00:32,702
And so

12
00:00:33,798 --> 00:00:39,143
You know, our philosophy is one of long-term growth, long-term sustainability or survivability.

13
00:00:40,344 --> 00:00:44,548
And we talk to a lot of companies, we talk to a lot of studios, we talk to a lot of developers.

14
00:00:45,669 --> 00:00:49,171
And the sort of the inspiration of this particular talk on

15
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:52,634
you know, entrepreneurship and avoiding studio disasters

16
00:00:52,694 --> 00:00:55,456
really kind of inspired by a bunch of the stuff we do

17
00:00:55,496 --> 00:00:58,537
with our own studios, but also with some of the problems

18
00:00:58,617 --> 00:01:01,839
and challenges we see with studios more broadly.

19
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,841
Over the past few years, we've invested in,

20
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:06,302
or we've done 25 deals.

21
00:01:08,103 --> 00:01:13,025
Not all of those studios are still alive. So out of the 25, 20 of them are still alive.

22
00:01:14,126 --> 00:01:20,948
And so, you know, from an investment point of view, 80% survival rate is actually not that bad.

23
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:24,130
A few studios or projects you might have heard of.

24
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:29,572
Kit Fox with Moon Hunters was released last year to much fanfare.

25
00:01:31,654 --> 00:01:49,175
We have one of our original teams, Double Stallion, launched a big IP with Cartoon Network called OKKO, Lakewood Plaza Turbo, on mobile, which was an interesting sort of attempt to launch a new IP on games before launching it on television, so an interesting experiment.

26
00:01:51,116 --> 00:01:56,040
One of our teams is Outerminds, the crew that does the co-productions with PewDiePie, so

27
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00,142
the actual PewDiePie branded games, very, very successful team.

28
00:02:01,683 --> 00:02:06,606
Another example is Diluvian, an underwater sub-game that was just released a couple weeks

29
00:02:06,646 --> 00:02:07,747
ago through Gambitious.

30
00:02:08,568 --> 00:02:09,628
And then earlier this week...

31
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:17,694
Children of Zodiarc's produced by a bunch of ex-Ubisoft developers called Cardboard Utopia

32
00:02:18,195 --> 00:02:24,980
was just announced, published by Square Enix, which is interesting for a Japanese RPG.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,863
I don't think you can find a better publishing partner than Square Enix.

34
00:02:29,544 --> 00:02:33,688
and a lot of other cool developers and projects.

35
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:40,674
And so, you know, the past few years I've been talking a lot about entrepreneurship and funding and pitching and so on.

36
00:02:41,455 --> 00:02:50,143
A few weeks ago I was in Germany at Casual Connect and I did a presentation on why your studio will not get funded and that kind of got picked up quite a bit in the media.

37
00:02:51,123 --> 00:02:54,084
Not everyone liked it, so this was a Facebook post from Jamil.

38
00:02:54,985 --> 00:03:01,288
For folks who know Jamil, he's head of strategy for games at Google.

39
00:03:01,628 --> 00:03:07,851
But I know Jamil a long time, and the issue he took was primarily because

40
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:11,172
I said the first reason that you're not going to get funding

41
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:13,313
is because you're making crap games.

42
00:03:13,853 --> 00:03:17,295
And he took offense to that, and I think it was slightly out of context.

43
00:03:19,876 --> 00:03:29,724
In that sense, I think it's probably an important time to warn you all that this is a lecture on entrepreneurship in the business track.

44
00:03:30,525 --> 00:03:34,809
And so commerce and money is an important part of that discussion.

45
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:42,155
And while I've been in the game industry a long time and believe in the creative and expressive power of games,

46
00:03:42,215 --> 00:03:46,799
and games as a medium, and it's an amazing canvas to create and express ourselves,

47
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,282
If you're talking about the business side,

48
00:03:50,302 --> 00:03:53,505
then obviously we have to be concerned about the dollar

49
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:53,866
bills.

50
00:03:54,847 --> 00:03:59,992
And so in respect to Jamil's concern and criticism,

51
00:04:00,012 --> 00:04:05,478
I will say that the initial tip, the starting tip, the baseline

52
00:04:05,538 --> 00:04:08,061
tip, is all of this only matters to the extent

53
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:10,183
that you're working on great games.

54
00:04:10,944 --> 00:04:14,286
Right, no amount of entrepreneurial savvy,

55
00:04:14,406 --> 00:04:17,768
no amount of salesmanship or pitching skills

56
00:04:17,808 --> 00:04:20,049
or all that kind of stuff is going to matter

57
00:04:20,309 --> 00:04:22,330
if you're not making great games.

58
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,372
So we're all going to just sort of take that as a given.

59
00:04:24,852 --> 00:04:25,953
Everyone's game is awesome.

60
00:04:26,973 --> 00:04:28,614
And we'll go from there.

61
00:04:29,715 --> 00:04:31,596
All right, so when talking about entrepreneurship,

62
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,204
There's all kinds of stuff, more so in the non-gaming space.

63
00:04:37,685 --> 00:04:40,208
And you can find all kinds of memes and tips and stuff

64
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:42,790
that don't necessarily say games,

65
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,892
but relate back to us.

66
00:04:44,912 --> 00:04:47,995
This is founder of LinkedIn, Reid Hoffman,

67
00:04:48,896 --> 00:04:51,919
saying something that we can all relate to in terms of the need

68
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:53,080
to iterate on our ideas.

69
00:04:54,161 --> 00:05:00,342
Or here, the infamous Dave McClure, very well-known early-stage investor, you know, kind of saying

70
00:05:00,382 --> 00:05:02,182
how most startups are pretty clueless, right?

71
00:05:02,663 --> 00:05:06,364
It means that you're still not quite sure what you're building, not quite sure who you're

72
00:05:06,384 --> 00:05:09,684
building it for, nor do you know how you're going to make money.

73
00:05:09,724 --> 00:05:13,345
So that kind of sounds like a lot of game developers, although he's not talking about

74
00:05:13,365 --> 00:05:13,885
game developers.

75
00:05:14,626 --> 00:05:15,526
This one I thought was cute.

76
00:05:18,028 --> 00:05:25,394
It's stressful, risky, challenging work to be in business, to be in the game business,

77
00:05:25,414 --> 00:05:27,836
to build companies, and so on.

78
00:05:28,637 --> 00:05:34,102
And then if you look at more so the kind of textbook definition of entrepreneurship.

79
00:05:35,056 --> 00:05:40,597
It usually involves these three core elements, which I think most people should be familiar

80
00:05:40,637 --> 00:05:40,958
with, right?

81
00:05:40,998 --> 00:05:47,599
You know, setting up and operating a company, you know, doing it in a context of risk and

82
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,420
uncertainty, right?

83
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,100
We don't know if this is going to succeed or what's going to happen.

84
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,741
And then the third one being an intention to make profit.

85
00:05:57,341 --> 00:06:00,563
And for game developers, the first two

86
00:06:00,644 --> 00:06:02,866
may be sort of obvious or a given,

87
00:06:03,206 --> 00:06:06,709
but oftentimes the third one is forgotten.

88
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,192
And so I often talk about the definition,

89
00:06:10,232 --> 00:06:13,976
my own definition of indies, because there's

90
00:06:13,996 --> 00:06:15,878
a lot of confusion over who's an indie

91
00:06:15,898 --> 00:06:17,239
and who can call themselves an indie,

92
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:18,360
and it's sort of a loaded term.

93
00:06:19,741 --> 00:06:25,646
But I always talk about Indies as people or developers or companies that have creative independence, right?

94
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,408
So they're working on the things they want to work on, they're working on their own ideas,

95
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:32,111
and that they have legal independence, right?

96
00:06:32,131 --> 00:06:35,654
So that they're their own entity, no one necessarily owns them,

97
00:06:35,674 --> 00:06:37,716
they're not part of a larger company, etc.

98
00:06:38,837 --> 00:06:40,438
So that to me is what an Indie is, right?

99
00:06:40,778 --> 00:06:42,700
Creative freedom, legal independence.

100
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,561
Now if we take all of those...

101
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:48,247
developers, studios that qualify as indie,

102
00:06:48,668 --> 00:06:50,108
creative freedom, legal independence,

103
00:06:51,049 --> 00:06:53,590
I like to categorize them across two other axes.

104
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,451
One is the degree of commercial intent,

105
00:06:57,072 --> 00:06:59,733
and the other is sort of quote unquote vision.

106
00:07:00,293 --> 00:07:04,255
Vision is just my catch all term for doing meaningful work,

107
00:07:04,295 --> 00:07:06,516
doing something creative, doing something innovative,

108
00:07:06,536 --> 00:07:09,258
doing something different, doing something visionary.

109
00:07:10,318 --> 00:07:11,499
And so this is where we would put

110
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:13,600
the kind of stereotypical starving artists.

111
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,102
They're doing visionary work, they're doing interesting, innovative stuff,

112
00:07:17,663 --> 00:07:20,725
but they're not really doing it in the context of commercial intent.

113
00:07:20,945 --> 00:07:24,007
They're not thinking about profit, they're not thinking about making money,

114
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:27,049
they're just, they have something they need to express themselves, they're creating.

115
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:29,971
So they're kind of, you know, stereotypical starving artists.

116
00:07:31,172 --> 00:07:33,374
This is where we would put the, you know, the sellouts.

117
00:07:34,397 --> 00:07:34,597
Right?

118
00:07:35,098 --> 00:07:36,819
They're intending to make money.

119
00:07:36,859 --> 00:07:37,920
They want to make money.

120
00:07:38,861 --> 00:07:40,982
But they're not doing anything particularly visionary.

121
00:07:41,743 --> 00:07:43,484
So maybe this is where we put all the studios that

122
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,846
are making Candy Crush colognes, or trying

123
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:48,288
to attempt to make a Clash Royale, or a MOBA,

124
00:07:48,308 --> 00:07:50,689
or something like that, where they see something else that's

125
00:07:50,749 --> 00:07:51,250
making money.

126
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,892
And they're just going to kind of do the same thing

127
00:07:54,612 --> 00:07:55,933
and hope they make tons of money.

128
00:07:55,993 --> 00:07:58,555
So that's not super interesting either.

129
00:07:59,656 --> 00:08:01,497
They're just lost down here.

130
00:08:03,973 --> 00:08:05,273
Because they're not doing innovative work,

131
00:08:05,313 --> 00:08:06,614
and they're not really trying to make money.

132
00:08:06,634 --> 00:08:08,554
Now, I mean, I'm joking, but let's

133
00:08:08,574 --> 00:08:10,375
say this is where students might go.

134
00:08:10,415 --> 00:08:11,695
They're still trying to find their way.

135
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,216
Maybe really kind of junior people

136
00:08:14,256 --> 00:08:16,117
that have just left college, and they're

137
00:08:16,137 --> 00:08:16,977
trying to figure things out.

138
00:08:17,057 --> 00:08:20,158
So ideally, the ones that are lost sort of find their way

139
00:08:20,178 --> 00:08:24,500
into one of the other quadrants as they mature and explore.

140
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,781
And then over here is where what I

141
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:31,122
would call the independent entrepreneurs.

142
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:39,005
So, they are indies, meaning they have creative freedom and legal independence, and they're

143
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:42,066
doing so in the context of commercial intent, right?

144
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:46,189
So they're trying to make money, the third bullet on the textbook definition of entrepreneurship.

145
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,901
And they're doing something visionary.

146
00:08:49,181 --> 00:08:50,903
They're doing meaningful work, innovating,

147
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,424
pushing the boundary, et cetera.

148
00:08:53,164 --> 00:08:56,447
And I think some of the sort of past discussions

149
00:08:56,987 --> 00:09:02,331
about identity around Indies has really

150
00:09:02,371 --> 00:09:05,934
been this sort of struggle between a binary definition

151
00:09:06,034 --> 00:09:08,416
of either you're a starving artist suffering

152
00:09:08,456 --> 00:09:10,957
for your craft, creating something meaningful,

153
00:09:11,498 --> 00:09:15,201
or you're a sellout that's making nothing worthwhile,

154
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:16,321
but you're trying to make a buck.

155
00:09:17,404 --> 00:09:21,225
And I think it's important to unpack that and really understand that there are other

156
00:09:21,785 --> 00:09:27,447
sort of more nuanced definitions and that this kind of happy medium on that spectrum

157
00:09:27,487 --> 00:09:30,408
of being an independent entrepreneur exists.

158
00:09:30,929 --> 00:09:33,429
So who are some of these independent entrepreneurs?

159
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,050
Some folks may recognize Tanya Short.

160
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,211
She's the head of Kitfox Games, one of the studios

161
00:09:39,251 --> 00:09:40,011
we invested in.

162
00:09:40,631 --> 00:09:44,552
Historically, her background is in design, MMO design,

163
00:09:44,592 --> 00:09:45,572
and writing and narrative.

164
00:09:46,672 --> 00:09:47,913
But she is very entrepreneurial.

165
00:09:47,953 --> 00:09:52,794
She leads the Kitfox team, very community and press

166
00:09:52,834 --> 00:09:53,734
influencer-minded.

167
00:09:53,754 --> 00:09:56,715
And she also handles all the budgets and that kind of stuff.

168
00:09:57,315 --> 00:10:00,716
And although the work they are doing at Kitfox

169
00:10:00,776 --> 00:10:01,936
is very innovative.

170
00:10:02,377 --> 00:10:05,770
they really are trying to build a studio that is profitable.

171
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:12,503
Maybe someone I think most people know, Rami Ismail, one half of Vlambeer.

172
00:10:14,964 --> 00:10:16,125
That dude is a hustler.

173
00:10:16,265 --> 00:10:25,769
I mean, he is a killer business person and is an entrepreneur, really textbook entrepreneur.

174
00:10:26,189 --> 00:10:30,071
But no one would sort of question that the work that he does and that Vlambeer does,

175
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:34,453
the games that they do, are cool and innovative and fun and all that good stuff.

176
00:10:35,213 --> 00:10:35,713
Nathan Vela.

177
00:10:36,695 --> 00:10:38,356
For those of you who know him from Toronto,

178
00:10:38,676 --> 00:10:41,018
co-founder of Cappy or Cappy Barra Games.

179
00:10:42,318 --> 00:10:44,540
Another studio doing really innovative, compelling work,

180
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,220
beautiful work.

181
00:10:46,121 --> 00:10:50,224
But Nathan is a really savvy businessman, business person,

182
00:10:50,464 --> 00:10:52,825
also is co-founder or partner in Indie Fund.

183
00:10:54,006 --> 00:10:54,647
Jenova Chen.

184
00:10:55,727 --> 00:10:59,190
Jenova Chen arguably is one of the best designer,

185
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,991
creative directors on the planet today.

186
00:11:01,751 --> 00:11:05,434
And a journey, a masterpiece, of course.

187
00:11:06,758 --> 00:11:10,122
People don't necessarily recognize that they're really smart at business, right?

188
00:11:10,182 --> 00:11:15,829
They were a student team coming out of USC and had a three contract or three project contract with Sony

189
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:21,836
And then soon after got several million dollars of funding from from from the valley investors

190
00:11:22,296 --> 00:11:28,797
So, you know, creative genius doing amazing games, masterpieces, and yet also in the context

191
00:11:28,837 --> 00:11:33,478
of commercial intent, you know, really, really savvy business side.

192
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:37,799
John Blow, likewise, and of course there's Tim Schafer.

193
00:11:37,819 --> 00:11:44,921
You know, again, an indie doing visionary work, meaningful work, but doing so in a context

194
00:11:44,961 --> 00:11:45,641
of commercial intent.

195
00:11:45,681 --> 00:11:49,782
So, the first sort of real tip is to embrace that identity.

196
00:11:51,481 --> 00:11:55,444
recognize that you're not a starving artist,

197
00:11:55,504 --> 00:11:57,305
but that in fact you are an entrepreneur

198
00:11:57,705 --> 00:11:59,867
or an independent entrepreneur, indie entrepreneur,

199
00:12:00,447 --> 00:12:02,929
and to really sort of take on that identity and own it.

200
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:07,052
And that's sort of an important first step.

201
00:12:07,192 --> 00:12:10,154
And we don't see a lot of developers doing that.

202
00:12:10,434 --> 00:12:14,197
They're almost embarrassed to be talking about money.

203
00:12:14,217 --> 00:12:15,758
They're kind of ashamed that they're

204
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:16,758
trying to do something innovative,

205
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:17,959
but they need funds and so on.

206
00:12:17,979 --> 00:12:19,100
So it's a weird sort of.

207
00:12:19,821 --> 00:12:21,384
situation so embrace that identity.

208
00:12:23,006 --> 00:12:28,555
This is Richard Atlas, an entrepreneur, an indie entrepreneur from Montreal.

209
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,200
We did not invest in them.

210
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,524
He's the co-founder of a studio called Clever Endeavor.

211
00:12:34,475 --> 00:12:40,237
Some of you may recognize the game that he and his team worked on called Ultimate Chicken Horse. It was released last year

212
00:12:40,257 --> 00:12:42,858
They had a successful Kickstarter

213
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:49,400
They I think they sold probably about a quarter million units on Steam at least according to Steam Spy

214
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,081
So the game has done, you know pretty well for a three-person team

215
00:12:53,281 --> 00:12:57,203
And they were I don't know if they won who won the design award last night at IGF

216
00:12:58,763 --> 00:12:59,283
Was anyone there?

217
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:01,375
I don't know who won.

218
00:13:02,076 --> 00:13:02,877
Quick, someone Google it.

219
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,624
So maybe they won the design award last night,

220
00:13:07,445 --> 00:13:08,187
or on Wednesday night.

221
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:12,454
But anyway, so they were nominated for Best Design

222
00:13:12,495 --> 00:13:12,875
in the IGF.

223
00:13:14,645 --> 00:13:19,869
which is not bad for a few unknown developers

224
00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:22,551
with zero experience starting their first company

225
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:24,232
essentially coming out of school.

226
00:13:25,353 --> 00:13:28,515
And I'm kind of shooting myself for not having had invested.

227
00:13:30,036 --> 00:13:32,258
So kudos to Richard and the team.

228
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:36,401
I think what's important to recognize

229
00:13:36,801 --> 00:13:38,603
is the business side was intentional.

230
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:44,332
When Richard was starting the studio, he was thinking about starting a studio.

231
00:13:44,352 --> 00:13:49,794
Not just making a cool game, but the idea that he needed to start a studio.

232
00:13:50,174 --> 00:13:55,536
Interestingly enough, Richard came from an engineering background, had no prior experience in games.

233
00:13:56,116 --> 00:13:59,477
like many of us, was passionate about games and wanted to move in that space, but realized

234
00:14:00,018 --> 00:14:01,438
he needed to build a business.

235
00:14:02,218 --> 00:14:06,400
Found some co-founders, was able to get some friends and family funding,

236
00:14:07,621 --> 00:14:13,683
and when they were prototyping Ultimate Chicken Horse, they did it, as many people do, in a game jam,

237
00:14:14,363 --> 00:14:17,284
and their game got some attention, so they knew they were onto something.

238
00:14:17,965 --> 00:14:22,306
Intentionally, they planned to go to PAX to get feedback.

239
00:14:23,326 --> 00:14:25,287
And one of their things early on was,

240
00:14:25,307 --> 00:14:27,707
I mean, when they were starting, it was about two years ago,

241
00:14:27,988 --> 00:14:30,708
so that was really the start of the shift towards the importance

242
00:14:30,748 --> 00:14:33,869
of influencer marketing and streamers and YouTubers and so on.

243
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:35,870
And sort of Richard latched onto that and said,

244
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,650
OK, we need to design a game that's going to be fun to watch

245
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,071
and that the streamers are going to want to play.

246
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:43,913
And so he would go to shows and hustle like crazy

247
00:14:43,953 --> 00:14:46,774
to meet all the YouTubers and talk to all the people

248
00:14:46,814 --> 00:14:48,115
that were managing the YouTubers.

249
00:14:48,715 --> 00:14:50,897
And everything he did was really intentional

250
00:14:51,317 --> 00:14:53,838
about thinking about this game as a product.

251
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:56,059
How was he going to enter it into the marketplace?

252
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,061
How was he going to get noticed vis-a-vis others?

253
00:14:58,421 --> 00:15:00,562
How was he going to optimize the game and the design

254
00:15:00,602 --> 00:15:02,463
and the art style to be viewable?

255
00:15:03,664 --> 00:15:05,945
And so I would say it was intentional.

256
00:15:07,042 --> 00:15:11,765
Another example of intention are the folks from Riot.

257
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:14,426
I mean, this is going back a few years.

258
00:15:14,486 --> 00:15:16,748
Brandon's a buddy of mine from way back.

259
00:15:17,789 --> 00:15:21,811
And I mean, I knew him when he was out trying to raise funds

260
00:15:22,332 --> 00:15:24,573
for Riot back in the day.

261
00:15:28,665 --> 00:15:31,587
he thought, or they thought they were onto something.

262
00:15:31,727 --> 00:15:33,569
It wasn't just, ah, we want to make this cool game.

263
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,812
Now, if you talk to Brandon, he will admit readily

264
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,654
that, of course, he did not or could not ever imagine

265
00:15:39,714 --> 00:15:42,356
the success that they've had with League.

266
00:15:43,197 --> 00:15:45,519
But they did intend to build a business

267
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:48,741
and create a game whom they thought there was a market for.

268
00:15:48,761 --> 00:15:52,104
And if they did the right things,

269
00:15:52,444 --> 00:15:53,385
they would be successful.

270
00:15:53,665 --> 00:15:56,167
And so they made these intentional decisions

271
00:15:56,227 --> 00:15:56,728
around that.

272
00:15:57,568 --> 00:16:03,229
And so that brings up the notion of uncertainty versus by accident.

273
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:08,910
And so it's one thing to say, listen, I think there's an opportunity to make a MOBA, and

274
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,391
there's a competitive market out there.

275
00:16:11,311 --> 00:16:15,072
We're not sure if it's going to succeed, but here's our thesis and our assumptions of why

276
00:16:15,112 --> 00:16:16,552
we think we're going to be successful.

277
00:16:17,512 --> 00:16:19,932
And then these are the steps we're going to do to attempt that.

278
00:16:20,552 --> 00:16:25,473
Is much different than saying, I'm just going to make my cool thing, and maybe by accident.

279
00:16:26,466 --> 00:16:27,868
you know, it'll be successful.

280
00:16:28,668 --> 00:16:30,070
Which is also kind of that difference

281
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:33,714
between intentionality or hope, right?

282
00:16:33,914 --> 00:16:37,458
As investors, we cannot invest on hope.

283
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:43,770
We can invest on uncertainty, we can invest on your thesis and assumptions,

284
00:16:44,251 --> 00:16:46,753
we can debate whether or not those assumptions are correct,

285
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:50,857
we can sort of work towards trying to resolve some of those assumptions

286
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:52,018
to see if they're right or wrong,

287
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,401
and that intention or intentionality has to be there.

288
00:16:56,822 --> 00:16:58,683
We can't just invest against,

289
00:16:59,264 --> 00:17:02,527
eh, maybe by accident we'll be successful,

290
00:17:02,587 --> 00:17:04,469
maybe hopefully we'll be successful.

291
00:17:06,997 --> 00:17:10,279
as tip two, this kind of catch-all of be intentional.

292
00:17:11,479 --> 00:17:14,141
Even this week, many of the developers we were talking to

293
00:17:14,161 --> 00:17:18,643
would say, ah, well, we created this cool little game

294
00:17:18,703 --> 00:17:21,244
idea at a game jam, and we liked it,

295
00:17:21,304 --> 00:17:22,585
so we're just going to work on it.

296
00:17:23,285 --> 00:17:24,266
Well, have you looked at the market?

297
00:17:24,286 --> 00:17:25,506
Have you seen your competitors?

298
00:17:26,247 --> 00:17:27,567
Do you think there's an audience for it?

299
00:17:28,328 --> 00:17:30,269
Ah, no, we just like this little mechanic,

300
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:32,270
so we're going to play with it and see what happens.

301
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:38,436
So, you know, if you're an entrepreneur and you're building a business, you need to be

302
00:17:38,576 --> 00:17:40,759
intentional about building that business.

303
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:47,025
And one of the things I will often tell developers is designing your business is as important

304
00:17:47,126 --> 00:17:48,547
as designing your game.

305
00:17:50,482 --> 00:17:51,923
So in that sense, from a design point of view,

306
00:17:51,943 --> 00:17:56,408
it makes me think of an old lecture from Will Wright

307
00:17:57,248 --> 00:17:59,450
many, many GDCs ago, where he talked

308
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,952
about the notion of local maxima,

309
00:18:00,972 --> 00:18:04,415
which is sort of mathematical stuff.

310
00:18:05,016 --> 00:18:08,219
I'm not smart enough to actually compute local maxima.

311
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:14,422
But he was talking about it in terms of design, of game design, in sort of the term that he

312
00:18:14,522 --> 00:18:21,026
used was the opportunity space of gameplay, in that as developers you don't want to get

313
00:18:21,186 --> 00:18:25,909
caught on a local maxima, which means you're at the bottom of one of the hills.

314
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:28,260
when you're at the bottom of the hill,

315
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,261
you don't really know how high the hill is,

316
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:31,482
and so you start climbing.

317
00:18:32,123 --> 00:18:33,884
And if you're climbing the hill on the left,

318
00:18:34,564 --> 00:18:35,745
and you get to the top of the hill,

319
00:18:35,785 --> 00:18:37,747
you feel happy that you conquered that hill,

320
00:18:38,007 --> 00:18:38,847
and then it's like, oh crap,

321
00:18:38,887 --> 00:18:40,348
you realize it was a much higher hill

322
00:18:40,629 --> 00:18:42,050
that's actually a much better design,

323
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:44,411
and I shouldn't have been optimizing

324
00:18:44,471 --> 00:18:46,953
for the local maxima of the small hill,

325
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,634
I should have been on the bigger hill

326
00:18:48,654 --> 00:18:51,056
and optimizing for that local maxima.

327
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:55,519
And so I think that applies to the business side as well,

328
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:55,899
in terms of.

329
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:57,911
that are built.

330
00:19:00,152 --> 00:19:04,076
In that I've often criticized developers

331
00:19:04,116 --> 00:19:07,238
who make couch co-op or local multiplayer games.

332
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:11,261
Despite the fact that couch co-op games are really fun,

333
00:19:11,682 --> 00:19:14,204
and they show well at events and show well at PAX,

334
00:19:14,764 --> 00:19:17,727
fundamentally as a product they don't sell well.

335
00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:20,209
Because it implies that I have friends.

336
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:22,700
and that I have four controllers,

337
00:19:23,321 --> 00:19:25,262
and I've got a sofa at my house or my home.

338
00:19:26,363 --> 00:19:30,285
And so you kind of get this false sense of confidence

339
00:19:30,305 --> 00:19:32,467
when everyone's cheering out there at the Indie Mega booth,

340
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:36,089
and then you release it on Steam and you sell 500 copies.

341
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:41,373
And so couch co-op games are the Little Hill.

342
00:19:42,405 --> 00:19:43,906
And you have many, many developers

343
00:19:43,946 --> 00:19:45,348
that are building couch co-op games,

344
00:19:45,368 --> 00:19:47,650
and they're optimizing for a local maxima that

345
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,072
inherently is not very high.

346
00:19:49,672 --> 00:19:51,494
And so as an investor, any time someone

347
00:19:51,534 --> 00:19:53,536
comes in with a couch co-op game, it's like, sorry.

348
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:54,477
You're on the little hill.

349
00:19:54,998 --> 00:19:55,498
Not interested.

350
00:19:56,422 --> 00:19:59,363
That doesn't mean you shouldn't make it, but if you're looking for funding or a publisher,

351
00:20:00,123 --> 00:20:02,505
they're mentally placing you on a hill.

352
00:20:03,005 --> 00:20:07,747
Now, of course, lightning can strike at any time, and maybe your local co-op game is so

353
00:20:07,847 --> 00:20:12,349
crazy amazing that you're going to be way past the local maxima, but as a rule of thumb,

354
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:14,350
this is the kind of thinking that goes into it.

355
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:17,872
So I don't know, what kinds of games are on the better hill?

356
00:20:19,193 --> 00:20:20,694
I'm at multiplayer games, I don't know.

357
00:20:22,902 --> 00:20:25,485
MOBAs, things that inherently can scale.

358
00:20:26,106 --> 00:20:28,168
But the problem is, of course, no one really knows

359
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:32,033
how high the, that's part of the challenge.

360
00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:35,537
But this also does require that you have some sense

361
00:20:36,177 --> 00:20:37,279
of what marketing is.

362
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:41,123
And most developers get marketing wrong.

363
00:20:42,081 --> 00:20:49,884
in part because they only think about marketing as advertising and PR.

364
00:20:50,804 --> 00:20:51,864
And that's not marketing.

365
00:20:51,924 --> 00:20:54,425
Marketing, I mean, famously there's the four Ps.

366
00:20:55,185 --> 00:20:59,727
One of those Ps is promotion, advertising and PR and so on.

367
00:21:00,487 --> 00:21:01,548
Another P is price.

368
00:21:02,308 --> 00:21:03,569
Which means, what's your business model?

369
00:21:03,609 --> 00:21:04,450
How are you pricing it?

370
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,912
So many developers debate about it.

371
00:21:06,952 --> 00:21:08,534
Do I make it $15 on Steam or $20?

372
00:21:08,994 --> 00:21:10,356
Do I allow sales or not?

373
00:21:10,376 --> 00:21:11,617
Or do I go free to play?

374
00:21:12,098 --> 00:21:12,678
That's price.

375
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,681
Determining the price and the business model

376
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:17,263
is part of marketing.

377
00:21:17,983 --> 00:21:19,945
Another one, P, is placement.

378
00:21:21,507 --> 00:21:26,331
In the context of the game industry, placement could be, well, which storefronts, which platforms

379
00:21:26,371 --> 00:21:26,891
am I on?

380
00:21:27,712 --> 00:21:32,436
Thinking about where you're going to deliver or distribute the game is part of marketing.

381
00:21:33,196 --> 00:21:36,339
And critically, the fourth P is product.

382
00:21:37,624 --> 00:21:40,746
So actually thinking about and determining what product,

383
00:21:40,786 --> 00:21:43,969
meaning what game are you making, is part of marketing.

384
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:46,370
And so when we work with our teams,

385
00:21:47,411 --> 00:21:49,012
we try to instill that thinking into them,

386
00:21:49,072 --> 00:21:50,914
that marketing is not relegated to,

387
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,255
I'm gonna put some ads.

388
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:55,956
but it's really sort of in a much more holistic sense.

389
00:21:56,436 --> 00:21:57,076
And what does that mean?

390
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:59,257
That means you're thinking about who's the audience.

391
00:21:59,617 --> 00:22:02,858
You know, which hill am I climbing and optimizing for?

392
00:22:03,178 --> 00:22:05,958
Can I get some sense of how tall that hill might be?

393
00:22:06,298 --> 00:22:07,939
Have I done, have I looked at SteamSpy

394
00:22:07,979 --> 00:22:09,739
to see what my competition looks like

395
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:10,639
and how they're selling?

396
00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:13,500
Have I, or gone on App Annie if I'm mobile.

397
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,741
Have I played the winners in that category

398
00:22:16,861 --> 00:22:17,921
to see what they're doing

399
00:22:18,101 --> 00:22:19,841
and try to think about why they've succeeded?

400
00:22:20,662 --> 00:22:24,883
And did I download a bunch of the losers and games that have failed in that category,

401
00:22:25,183 --> 00:22:29,085
and understood why did they fail, and then, you know, where's my game?

402
00:22:29,165 --> 00:22:32,286
Am I closer to the winners? Am I closer to the losers?

403
00:22:32,306 --> 00:22:35,447
You know, and often that's sort of a fine line.

404
00:22:36,387 --> 00:22:40,769
Many developers don't do that, that competitive analysis, market analysis, audience analysis.

405
00:22:41,229 --> 00:22:43,370
I mean, it's still sort of voodoo magic, right? It's not like...

406
00:22:45,014 --> 00:22:50,058
there's a recipe and just follow these ten steps and you've done your marketing or your analysis.

407
00:22:50,138 --> 00:22:55,983
But, you know, in most cases it's just completely forgotten about and ignored.

408
00:22:56,683 --> 00:22:56,984
And so...

409
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,681
Doing that kind of more broad or holistic sense of marketing,

410
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:05,923
thinking about the choice of the product that you're making,

411
00:23:06,143 --> 00:23:07,444
and the audience you're delivering it to,

412
00:23:07,464 --> 00:23:11,466
and the price point, and just all those things, in part,

413
00:23:11,526 --> 00:23:15,268
will help ensure that you don't get stuck on a local maxima.

414
00:23:15,288 --> 00:23:16,929
And so that would be the next tip.

415
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:22,574
is don't, by accident, get caught on a local maxima.

416
00:23:22,654 --> 00:23:24,456
If you're gonna climb a hill,

417
00:23:24,976 --> 00:23:26,798
at least do some homework to determine

418
00:23:26,858 --> 00:23:30,641
if you're probably climbing a good hill.

419
00:23:30,661 --> 00:23:33,263
Because remember, as an entrepreneur,

420
00:23:34,264 --> 00:23:37,327
one of the things is the intent to make profit.

421
00:23:37,907 --> 00:23:39,769
And so don't just end up by accident

422
00:23:39,989 --> 00:23:42,711
on a hill that has no real potential.

423
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,454
That being said, we're gonna make lots of mistakes.

424
00:23:47,247 --> 00:23:50,170
And there's all kinds of stories of failure throughout our industry.

425
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,012
This is an article from quite a few years ago.

426
00:23:52,913 --> 00:24:00,341
You may recognize Arana Gozi and Alex Rogopoulos, co-founders of Harmonics out in Boston.

427
00:24:01,142 --> 00:24:05,326
Famously, they created Guitar Hero and Rock Band at the time.

428
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,227
I think this is an article from 2009.

429
00:24:07,267 --> 00:24:11,308
So at the time, those were still billion dollar franchises.

430
00:24:11,528 --> 00:24:12,888
But the article here kind of goes on

431
00:24:13,228 --> 00:24:15,289
about how they had 10 years of quote, unquote,

432
00:24:15,309 --> 00:24:16,409
horrendous failure.

433
00:24:17,109 --> 00:24:19,389
And that they struggled, and they were exploring

434
00:24:19,469 --> 00:24:20,950
the opportunity space.

435
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,230
They were climbing all the different hills for rhythm

436
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,891
action games, and music games, and all this kind of stuff,

437
00:24:25,911 --> 00:24:28,371
until they sort of discovered the tall hill, which

438
00:24:28,431 --> 00:24:32,072
was good guitar hero and rock band.

439
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:38,735
And so, you know, part of that, you know, marketing process is this notion of discovery.

440
00:24:39,275 --> 00:24:43,317
You know, obviously, you know, Angerbirds is another one of the famous stories where

441
00:24:43,597 --> 00:24:50,000
Rovio had 51 other games until they, you know, discovered the little red bird and obviously

442
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,721
then that, you know, blew up.

443
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:56,423
But I mean, I do a whole other lecture just on the value of failure.

444
00:24:57,665 --> 00:25:02,847
And what many people don't fully respect is that amount of time,

445
00:25:03,028 --> 00:25:05,348
that amount of exploration, that amount of failure

446
00:25:05,789 --> 00:25:09,670
is a necessary ingredient to discover the success.

447
00:25:10,811 --> 00:25:14,472
There's no way that if you just sit down and say, OK,

448
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:18,914
let's make the next billion dollar franchise go.

449
00:25:19,494 --> 00:25:20,855
Like, we just couldn't come up with it.

450
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:24,236
So anyway, that's a whole other lecture.

451
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:25,837
I won't go further than that.

452
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:25,977
But.

453
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:30,339
That failure is valuable.

454
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:34,482
And so it's funny because just last week before coming to GDC,

455
00:25:34,942 --> 00:25:37,404
I saw a pitch from some really experienced developers,

456
00:25:37,504 --> 00:25:38,885
primarily from the AAA space.

457
00:25:39,806 --> 00:25:41,127
And they were pitching, saying,

458
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:42,347
well, we're from the AAA space.

459
00:25:42,387 --> 00:25:44,629
We're going to come to mobile and conquer mobile.

460
00:25:44,649 --> 00:25:46,750
We have all kinds of new ideas of how to, you know,

461
00:25:47,071 --> 00:25:48,291
take over in mobile.

462
00:25:49,812 --> 00:25:52,093
And no one on the team, despite their pedigree,

463
00:25:52,393 --> 00:25:54,094
at least in the materials that were provided,

464
00:25:54,494 --> 00:25:58,375
had any experience in mobile, no experience in free-to-play,

465
00:25:58,655 --> 00:26:01,356
had not worked at any companies in the mobile space.

466
00:26:01,916 --> 00:26:04,037
And so I dismissed it.

467
00:26:04,978 --> 00:26:08,619
And I wrote them back saying, wow, lots of talent.

468
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:13,040
you know, interesting idea, but you guys have, this is your experience.

469
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:18,521
And he wrote back, oh no no no no, we worked at game companies, but we didn't like them in the mobile space,

470
00:26:18,561 --> 00:26:23,362
and we were on a few failed projects, but we didn't want to put anything that looked bad on our,

471
00:26:23,462 --> 00:26:25,543
you know, on our resumes and the pitch deck and stuff.

472
00:26:25,903 --> 00:26:29,283
And I'm like, dude, I almost threw your thing in the garbage because you, you know,

473
00:26:29,303 --> 00:26:32,684
you didn't show that you had been in that space and had any experience.

474
00:26:33,084 --> 00:26:36,888
and so they were trying to shield themselves and not show any of that failure.

475
00:26:36,908 --> 00:26:43,354
And as an investor, I always prefer that someone else has paid for that failure.

476
00:26:43,414 --> 00:26:46,397
Either out of your own time or working at some other company,

477
00:26:46,777 --> 00:26:50,241
that is super, super valuable, that failure.

478
00:26:50,261 --> 00:26:52,303
So don't hide that.

479
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:56,146
A very famous book, who's read The Lean Startup?

480
00:26:57,577 --> 00:26:59,158
Okay, everyone else should read it.

481
00:27:00,099 --> 00:27:01,800
And I have some other book recommendations later,

482
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,562
but this is Eric Ries,

483
00:27:06,143 --> 00:27:07,344
the author of Lean Startup.

484
00:27:08,325 --> 00:27:10,627
And unlike most other business books

485
00:27:11,147 --> 00:27:12,308
or business book authors,

486
00:27:12,728 --> 00:27:15,470
Eric actually worked in the game industry for many years.

487
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:18,152
I mean, more in sort of social, online, virtual world stuff,

488
00:27:18,172 --> 00:27:21,154
but at least we can kind of consider him one of us

489
00:27:21,214 --> 00:27:21,875
to a certain extent.

490
00:27:24,156 --> 00:27:25,637
But he's not in the game industry anymore.

491
00:27:26,862 --> 00:27:29,384
the lean, people get lean startup wrong, right?

492
00:27:29,404 --> 00:27:32,326
They think of lean as not paying a lot of money,

493
00:27:32,366 --> 00:27:34,608
like we're gonna tighten our belts and we get lean

494
00:27:34,648 --> 00:27:36,089
because we're eating ramen.

495
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:39,212
But that's not what lean is in this context.

496
00:27:39,232 --> 00:27:41,714
It's about reducing waste, right?

497
00:27:41,774 --> 00:27:43,496
It comes much more from the automotive space

498
00:27:44,617 --> 00:27:45,417
and all the stuff there.

499
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:46,458
But.

500
00:27:47,443 --> 00:27:50,224
Although Eric doesn't talk about lean startup in this way,

501
00:27:50,244 --> 00:27:53,545
I view the methodologies presented in lean startup

502
00:27:54,125 --> 00:27:56,806
as a recipe for systematic failure.

503
00:27:57,606 --> 00:27:58,887
And that's a good thing, surprisingly,

504
00:27:58,907 --> 00:27:59,707
although I say it like that.

505
00:28:00,327 --> 00:28:03,288
And so one of the key learnings that Eric talks about

506
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:06,089
as a startup, as a small company,

507
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,810
is to accelerate the rate of learning.

508
00:28:11,336 --> 00:28:13,817
And when you're learning, you're succeeding, you're failing.

509
00:28:15,998 --> 00:28:18,439
And that also relates back to the notion of local maxima.

510
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,740
You have the landscape.

511
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,581
You don't really know which hill is what.

512
00:28:21,941 --> 00:28:23,382
So you have to start climbing the hill.

513
00:28:23,422 --> 00:28:24,963
And as you climb the hill, you're learning,

514
00:28:25,323 --> 00:28:26,423
is this a good hill to climb?

515
00:28:26,443 --> 00:28:31,546
And you want to accelerate the process by which you can learn.

516
00:28:33,027 --> 00:28:34,127
And who's really good at that?

517
00:28:35,568 --> 00:28:35,968
Supercell.

518
00:28:37,605 --> 00:28:40,326
I mean, you know, lots have been written about Supercell,

519
00:28:40,786 --> 00:28:44,568
but the most important thing is how they fail,

520
00:28:45,028 --> 00:28:46,889
and how they value failure, and the whole process

521
00:28:46,929 --> 00:28:49,951
and their culture about, you know, anyone can kill a project at any time.

522
00:28:50,591 --> 00:28:54,113
And so, you know, each of those tombstones was a little hill.

523
00:28:55,213 --> 00:28:56,994
And they recognized it was going to be a little hill,

524
00:28:57,534 --> 00:29:00,336
and they said, folks, the hill's too little, kill it.

525
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:04,892
you know, let's climb another hill and see where that gets us.

526
00:29:05,552 --> 00:29:08,874
And be able to accelerate that process by which they learn which hills are the good

527
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:13,237
hills and how many hills do they climb, and their whole company is built on that process

528
00:29:13,277 --> 00:29:18,360
of learning, iteration, discovery, going up the hills, calculating the local maxima, realizing

529
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,041
it's not a good hill, bailing on it, et cetera.

530
00:29:20,962 --> 00:29:25,224
And this also relates back to the notion of sunk costs.

531
00:29:26,005 --> 00:29:30,408
And so the next tip is don't fall in the sunk cost trap.

532
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:36,761
Cost is one of the most dangerous sort of mental traps that we have as humans.

533
00:29:37,662 --> 00:29:42,527
Right, that if we spent six months of our time and our savings to work on this

534
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:47,873
cool couch co-op game and then some crazy guy named Jason says you're not

535
00:29:47,893 --> 00:29:50,436
going to make any money with that game why are you making it?

536
00:29:51,724 --> 00:29:55,727
Well, you're going to ignore me because you don't want to lose the time and money you

537
00:29:55,767 --> 00:29:57,209
already invested in making that game.

538
00:29:57,989 --> 00:30:00,611
And so that there is the sunk cost trap.

539
00:30:01,352 --> 00:30:04,575
And in reality, what you've spent, what you've sunk is gone.

540
00:30:04,615 --> 00:30:05,776
You will never get that back.

541
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:09,819
And all your decisions should be made on a go-forward basis.

542
00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:15,624
So as of right now, if we keep spending time and money on this couch co-op game, is that

543
00:30:15,664 --> 00:30:16,585
a good business decision?

544
00:30:18,063 --> 00:30:22,488
And a lot of people don't do that because it's a psychological weakness or a blind spot

545
00:30:22,508 --> 00:30:26,754
of humans where you don't want to let go of the money you already or the time you already

546
00:30:26,774 --> 00:30:28,696
or the emotion you already spent.

547
00:30:28,736 --> 00:30:30,779
So Supercell for example.

548
00:30:31,964 --> 00:30:33,204
They don't care, right?

549
00:30:33,864 --> 00:30:35,365
The sunk cost trap, they don't have it,

550
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:38,747
but they're one of the few studios that thinks in that way.

551
00:30:39,507 --> 00:30:42,289
And again, I mean, I think some of my failure lectures

552
00:30:42,629 --> 00:30:45,290
up on YouTube, so if this notion of the failure piece

553
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:47,091
and sunk cost traps is of interest,

554
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:50,153
you can Google or check me on YouTube.

555
00:30:51,974 --> 00:30:53,515
Partially, this also requires that

556
00:30:55,015 --> 00:30:57,076
you have some sense of vision.

557
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,541
And a lot of developers, a lot of entrepreneurs

558
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:04,283
don't take the time to have vision for their studio.

559
00:31:04,303 --> 00:31:06,804
It's not just like the creative vision

560
00:31:06,844 --> 00:31:07,825
of the game I'm building.

561
00:31:07,845 --> 00:31:10,726
It's the vision of the studio, the kind of company,

562
00:31:11,607 --> 00:31:13,307
the pillars, the roadmap of where

563
00:31:13,347 --> 00:31:17,810
we want to go as a business, the kinds of games we want to do,

564
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:19,851
the kind of culture we want to have, et cetera.

565
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,972
We often talk about this in the context of scaffolding.

566
00:31:24,025 --> 00:31:27,148
That as you're building a business, you need to be thinking about the scaffolding you're

567
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:29,691
constructing, like you're building this amazing skyscraper.

568
00:31:29,711 --> 00:31:33,815
In order to do that, you have to build the supporting structures around it to allow you

569
00:31:33,836 --> 00:31:34,837
to go higher and higher.

570
00:31:34,857 --> 00:31:36,538
So this is what we call scaffolding.

571
00:31:37,179 --> 00:31:41,143
And if you don't have a vision, it's impossible to make decisions.

572
00:31:42,022 --> 00:31:43,823
that lead you to constructing the scaffolding.

573
00:31:44,463 --> 00:31:47,585
And so, for example, let's say right now we're

574
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:48,785
working on a couch co-op game.

575
00:31:49,185 --> 00:31:51,166
And once that's done, we're going to do a VR racing game.

576
00:31:51,266 --> 00:31:53,647
Once that's done, we're going to do an idler on mobile.

577
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:55,908
And once that's done, we have an idea for an MMO.

578
00:31:55,968 --> 00:31:59,730
And essentially, you're restarting from scratch

579
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:00,971
every time.

580
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:04,152
Because there's really not much learning and value

581
00:32:04,972 --> 00:32:08,294
that comes from doing the VR racing game to go to the MMO

582
00:32:08,354 --> 00:32:10,555
to go to the idler on mobile.

583
00:32:10,575 --> 00:32:11,595
It's just too random.

584
00:32:11,615 --> 00:32:12,575
You don't have intention.

585
00:32:13,476 --> 00:32:18,478
Whereas if we say, OK, we want to make competitive games

586
00:32:19,318 --> 00:32:23,300
on this particular platform using procedural generation

587
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,001
because we have expertise in that, and I don't know,

588
00:32:26,021 --> 00:32:27,041
whatever, narrative something.

589
00:32:27,702 --> 00:32:29,943
Then the first game you make will have some elements

590
00:32:30,023 --> 00:32:32,524
of procedural and narrative and whatever we said.

591
00:32:33,404 --> 00:32:34,724
And that may or may not succeed.

592
00:32:35,024 --> 00:32:37,826
But the tools you've built, the technology you've used,

593
00:32:38,126 --> 00:32:41,407
the design learning you've had, the person you hired,

594
00:32:41,447 --> 00:32:43,028
the coder you hired that has expertise

595
00:32:43,068 --> 00:32:45,909
in procedural generation is now part of the team.

596
00:32:46,249 --> 00:32:47,569
So that when you go into game two,

597
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:52,033
It doesn't mean it's a sequel, but it's another game that's

598
00:32:52,073 --> 00:32:54,576
competitive with narrative and procedural stuff.

599
00:32:54,596 --> 00:32:56,758
You're going to take all that knowledge and tool set

600
00:32:56,798 --> 00:32:59,440
and pipeline and the people you used to build the first one,

601
00:32:59,881 --> 00:33:02,503
now you build the second one, and it goes much faster.

602
00:33:03,584 --> 00:33:05,366
Kit Fox, actually one of our studios,

603
00:33:05,727 --> 00:33:07,148
kind of has that sort of vision.

604
00:33:07,688 --> 00:33:10,451
And they had an idea of what the third and fourth game

605
00:33:10,471 --> 00:33:11,833
they really wanted to make was.

606
00:33:12,413 --> 00:33:16,797
But they knew on day one as a startup, they didn't have the resources, the production

607
00:33:16,837 --> 00:33:22,222
capacity, the recognition to get to that third or fourth game, so they kind of backtracked

608
00:33:22,262 --> 00:33:27,887
and said, well, what smaller game can we do now that we have the means for that then allows

609
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:31,831
us to build the scaffolding to build the second game, and then that one hopefully will build

610
00:33:31,851 --> 00:33:34,373
the scaffolding that will allow us to build the third and fourth game.

611
00:33:34,393 --> 00:33:36,955
That's a very powerful thing.

612
00:33:37,576 --> 00:33:39,277
But you have to be thinking about that vision.

613
00:33:39,297 --> 00:33:41,179
You have to have that roadmap so you

614
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:44,682
can make those decisions three or four games ahead of time.

615
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:47,584
And we just don't see that from a lot of developers.

616
00:33:48,465 --> 00:33:52,389
Samantha is co-founder of Artifact 5, also one

617
00:33:52,409 --> 00:33:54,911
of the studios that we invested in.

618
00:33:55,671 --> 00:33:57,933
They're working on a cool, surreal, very emotional,

619
00:33:58,013 --> 00:33:59,875
mature game called Anamorphine.

620
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:02,397
They've won a bunch of festival awards.

621
00:34:02,857 --> 00:34:05,520
I think they just won Best Narrative at the Game

622
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:05,860
Connection.

623
00:34:06,682 --> 00:34:07,506
earlier this week.

624
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:10,016
And it's their first project.

625
00:34:10,975 --> 00:34:12,456
Individually, they've worked at other companies.

626
00:34:12,656 --> 00:34:14,818
So from a production point of view, they're experienced.

627
00:34:14,858 --> 00:34:17,560
But this is their first initiative as entrepreneurs

628
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:19,282
in their own studio.

629
00:34:20,783 --> 00:34:22,725
And they're just finishing up on anamorphine.

630
00:34:23,225 --> 00:34:25,747
And they're trying to think ahead to the roadmap.

631
00:34:25,787 --> 00:34:27,368
They have the second game they want to work on.

632
00:34:27,709 --> 00:34:29,850
So part of our thinking to come to GDC

633
00:34:30,251 --> 00:34:31,572
was to get some work for hire.

634
00:34:32,232 --> 00:34:35,615
Because there might be some cash flow gaps in their roadmap.

635
00:34:35,655 --> 00:34:37,877
And so I'm going to go to GDC and see if I can pick up

636
00:34:37,897 --> 00:34:38,658
a contract or two.

637
00:34:39,058 --> 00:34:39,919
And I said, don't do that.

638
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,293
That's not part of the vision.

639
00:34:44,335 --> 00:34:47,381
Making some Mickey Mouse game for Disney,

640
00:34:47,501 --> 00:34:50,026
how does that serve your vision of building

641
00:34:50,086 --> 00:34:53,032
mature, surreal, emotional games?

642
00:34:53,971 --> 00:34:57,752
You know, like, why are you going to distract yourselves from that vision?

643
00:34:57,792 --> 00:34:58,573
Oh, well, cash flow.

644
00:34:58,593 --> 00:35:02,814
I said, no, you're building your business with a certain vision, with a certain roadmap.

645
00:35:02,854 --> 00:35:03,715
You have to stick to that.

646
00:35:04,315 --> 00:35:08,937
And the advice I gave her in that particular situation was, now, if you go to GDC and you

647
00:35:08,997 --> 00:35:14,099
find someone who has a movie or an author that's writing a book or a TV show that is

648
00:35:14,459 --> 00:35:16,820
mature, surreal, emotionally driven.

649
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:21,043
and they need a game done, okay, well now you're talking, right?

650
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:24,146
There there's potential collaboration, a partnership to happen

651
00:35:24,467 --> 00:35:27,390
that then serves the vision of your studio

652
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:31,373
and also contributes to the scaffolding of where you want to go.

653
00:35:32,474 --> 00:35:36,298
And so, you know, not that inherently doing work for hire is a bad thing

654
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:39,681
and in some cases it's necessary just from a survivability point of view,

655
00:35:39,982 --> 00:35:41,303
but make sure you're doing it.

656
00:35:41,863 --> 00:35:46,546
that's still serving the vision and still serving your roadmap

657
00:35:46,626 --> 00:35:48,227
for scaffolding.

658
00:35:49,388 --> 00:35:50,148
And in part.

659
00:35:52,074 --> 00:35:54,375
you need to know that before you go out and hustle.

660
00:35:55,175 --> 00:35:57,255
So Samantha would have really wasted her time

661
00:35:57,295 --> 00:36:00,316
to try to pitch Disney to do some work for hire contracts

662
00:36:00,376 --> 00:36:02,596
or Cartoon Networks or whatever, because that's

663
00:36:02,676 --> 00:36:04,416
not the DNA of their studio.

664
00:36:05,717 --> 00:36:08,017
And so you need to know what you're

665
00:36:08,077 --> 00:36:09,697
selling before you go and hustle.

666
00:36:10,238 --> 00:36:12,478
As another example, also before GDC,

667
00:36:12,918 --> 00:36:17,699
some real veteran developers came to me for some advice

668
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:19,359
and feedback on their pitch.

669
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:20,760
And.

670
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,401
They're working on this cool project,

671
00:36:23,501 --> 00:36:26,223
but really they were trying to find investment for the studio.

672
00:36:26,724 --> 00:36:28,125
They had been working on this vision

673
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:31,807
and thinking about the pillars of the kind of company

674
00:36:31,827 --> 00:36:32,488
they wanted to build.

675
00:36:33,448 --> 00:36:35,830
And so they wanted to come to GDC to find partners

676
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,171
to invest in the company.

677
00:36:37,772 --> 00:36:40,574
And as developers, really, they're

678
00:36:40,594 --> 00:36:42,735
responsible for some of the biggest franchises, billions

679
00:36:42,775 --> 00:36:43,216
of dollars.

680
00:36:43,676 --> 00:36:45,897
So from a pedigree point of view, it's like, yes,

681
00:36:45,917 --> 00:36:46,718
you want to back them.

682
00:36:47,298 --> 00:36:48,059
Really amazing.

683
00:36:48,579 --> 00:36:49,600
But the deck they had.

684
00:36:50,983 --> 00:36:53,784
was like 31 slides.

685
00:36:54,944 --> 00:36:56,505
One slide was the name of the company,

686
00:36:57,225 --> 00:36:59,485
and the other 30 slides were about gameplay mechanics

687
00:36:59,986 --> 00:37:03,326
and the creatures and all the stuff about the game.

688
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,407
I said, well, hold on a second.

689
00:37:05,747 --> 00:37:08,247
You just said you want to sell the pedigree,

690
00:37:08,347 --> 00:37:11,548
like you as founders, your track record,

691
00:37:11,628 --> 00:37:12,768
the vision of the studio,

692
00:37:13,089 --> 00:37:15,649
and you want partners to fund the studio,

693
00:37:16,029 --> 00:37:17,510
and yet you've shown me a logo

694
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:19,970
and 30 pages of weapons and mechanics

695
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:20,830
and creature designs.

696
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:26,133
And, you know, someone who's interested in investing in the company, say, well, I'm not

697
00:37:26,173 --> 00:37:26,733
interested in that.

698
00:37:26,773 --> 00:37:31,675
I don't need to see 30 pages of monsters and whatever, weapons and stuff.

699
00:37:31,695 --> 00:37:37,738
So as the next tip, you really need to know what your vision is before you go out and

700
00:37:37,778 --> 00:37:42,480
hustle, before you go out and find your partners, before you actually know what it is that's

701
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:46,982
unique and valuable, what you're doing to go out there in the marketplace.

702
00:37:48,282 --> 00:37:49,223
All right.

703
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:54,351
Next up is revenue versus proof.

704
00:37:55,811 --> 00:38:00,372
What I mean by that, there's kind of two modes of a business.

705
00:38:00,492 --> 00:38:05,053
Either from day one, we're going to go make revenue as quick as possible.

706
00:38:05,073 --> 00:38:10,054
We're going to bootstrap and get a product on market as quickly as possible to generate

707
00:38:10,074 --> 00:38:14,375
revenue because revenue is king and revenue allows us to then build the company and so

708
00:38:14,415 --> 00:38:14,515
on.

709
00:38:14,535 --> 00:38:15,755
So very revenue focused.

710
00:38:18,534 --> 00:38:24,080
Some developers are in the camp, but it's quite rare because often games take a long time to make and need a lot of resources

711
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:28,785
And it's not an easy path and so most developers are selling proof

712
00:38:30,507 --> 00:38:32,089
Or often what we refer to as

713
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:35,072
Selling the sizzle versus selling the steak

714
00:38:36,474 --> 00:38:40,376
And so developers tend to sell the sizzle, the pedigree,

715
00:38:40,496 --> 00:38:44,879
our track record, we went to PAX and won an award,

716
00:38:45,419 --> 00:38:47,600
look how awesome the game is, play it, it's fun.

717
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:51,403
You're selling the hype, the excitement of you,

718
00:38:51,603 --> 00:38:55,185
of the game, of the roadmap, et cetera, versus the stake,

719
00:38:55,225 --> 00:38:56,406
because you don't have the stake yet.

720
00:38:57,586 --> 00:39:00,608
Some investors, a lot of formal institutional investors,

721
00:39:01,289 --> 00:39:02,570
often look past the sizzles.

722
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,291
I don't care about the sizzle, show me the steak.

723
00:39:04,311 --> 00:39:06,072
They invest based on revenue and stuff.

724
00:39:06,092 --> 00:39:07,773
They're sort of more the banker style.

725
00:39:08,573 --> 00:39:12,496
The problem with the sizzle is that no investor

726
00:39:12,776 --> 00:39:14,897
wants to invest to make a bridge

727
00:39:14,937 --> 00:39:17,939
that ends in the middle of the river, right?

728
00:39:17,959 --> 00:39:20,621
Then we might as well have not spent a dollar

729
00:39:20,701 --> 00:39:21,822
to go halfway into the river, right?

730
00:39:21,842 --> 00:39:23,583
Because that bridge that's been built is useless.

731
00:39:24,777 --> 00:39:29,480
And so investors tend to want to ensure that you have a plan,

732
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,902
roadmap, vision, et cetera, budget, and so on,

733
00:39:32,302 --> 00:39:34,384
that gets you to the other side of the river.

734
00:39:34,844 --> 00:39:37,646
And developers tend to be very bad at that.

735
00:39:39,107 --> 00:39:40,868
We often get this sort of pitch where.

736
00:39:43,205 --> 00:39:48,628
Here's my monthly burn, so times 12, that's how much money I need.

737
00:39:49,409 --> 00:39:52,671
So I can work for another year and just get stuff done.

738
00:39:53,952 --> 00:39:57,894
So that sounds like, all right, well, we're just going to start building some of the bridge,

739
00:39:57,914 --> 00:40:01,176
and then 12 months runs out, and we're in the middle of the river, and it was a big

740
00:40:01,196 --> 00:40:01,456
waste.

741
00:40:02,136 --> 00:40:10,121
And so you need to think about budgeting, planning, operations more like a rally, checkpoint

742
00:40:10,161 --> 00:40:10,661
to checkpoint.

743
00:40:11,978 --> 00:40:16,781
You need to ensure that the budget or the revenue, the funding you ask for, the deal

744
00:40:16,821 --> 00:40:19,683
you get, at least gets you to the next checkpoint.

745
00:40:21,524 --> 00:40:27,007
And that checkpoint should be defined not as three months from now, but it should be

746
00:40:27,047 --> 00:40:32,491
defined as the thing that I need to have the proof to convince the next investor to give

747
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:34,552
me gas in the tank to get to the next checkpoint.

748
00:40:35,545 --> 00:40:40,450
And so this is why there's a whole other lecture I do on funding models and funding stages,

749
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:45,495
lifecycle and so on, where you approach different investors at different stages, right?

750
00:40:45,515 --> 00:40:49,939
So the very beginning when you have no proof, it's love money, friends and family and fools.

751
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,561
And they're only, you know, only because they love you,

752
00:40:52,601 --> 00:40:54,061
they give you the money, because you have nothing.

753
00:40:54,341 --> 00:40:56,482
So that's the first sort of bit of gas in the tank.

754
00:40:56,803 --> 00:40:58,803
And then you use that money to hire a programmer

755
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:00,344
and get an artist and make a prototype,

756
00:41:00,664 --> 00:41:01,905
and then you go see some angels,

757
00:41:03,646 --> 00:41:04,606
and then they give you a, and they say,

758
00:41:04,626 --> 00:41:05,466
well, that's really cool.

759
00:41:05,486 --> 00:41:07,067
Okay, I like this sizzle.

760
00:41:07,547 --> 00:41:08,668
I like where you've progressed.

761
00:41:09,028 --> 00:41:10,309
Let me put some more gas in the tank

762
00:41:10,329 --> 00:41:11,449
so you can get to the next checkpoint.

763
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:13,390
Right, and then the next checkpoint is,

764
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:15,111
I don't know, you have a first playable, whatever.

765
00:41:15,371 --> 00:41:17,052
And then that allows you to do a Kickstarter

766
00:41:17,352 --> 00:41:19,613
or scores you a, you know, a publishing deal.

767
00:41:20,724 --> 00:41:24,826
But if you're starting at zero, you can't go to the people that are used to investing

768
00:41:24,866 --> 00:41:28,969
at later stages of the race because you're not ready for them.

769
00:41:28,989 --> 00:41:30,350
You haven't built up enough proof.

770
00:41:31,231 --> 00:41:38,035
And so when you're doing your planning, budgeting, fundraising, you always need to budget slash

771
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:40,037
fund to key proof points.

772
00:41:41,117 --> 00:41:41,818
And it's hard.

773
00:41:41,858 --> 00:41:45,000
You really have to think about, OK, if I'm future me.

774
00:41:46,124 --> 00:41:48,125
And I got to do stuff now and pay people now.

775
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:51,487
And what's the next thing that's going

776
00:41:51,507 --> 00:41:53,467
to be good enough to convince someone else to give me

777
00:41:53,488 --> 00:41:56,589
a publishing deal or do a Kickstarter or get investment?

778
00:41:57,029 --> 00:41:59,730
As opposed to, I'm just going to keep going for a few more months

779
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:03,832
and see how far I get, and the bridge is halfway in the river.

780
00:42:06,494 --> 00:42:08,594
On premium, let's say if we're thinking of a Steam game,

781
00:42:09,315 --> 00:42:12,736
oftentimes that could be the next checkpoint

782
00:42:12,756 --> 00:42:13,817
is hitting early access.

783
00:42:14,497 --> 00:42:15,298
Just as an example.

784
00:42:15,698 --> 00:42:17,220
And once we're in early access,

785
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:19,502
then we see how the game performs,

786
00:42:19,542 --> 00:42:21,184
and that could give us then the confidence

787
00:42:21,204 --> 00:42:24,107
to keep going or convince another investor.

788
00:42:24,688 --> 00:42:26,990
As a side note, one of the problems is

789
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:30,213
if you've only budgeted to get into early access,

790
00:42:30,253 --> 00:42:30,794
you're in trouble.

791
00:42:31,434 --> 00:42:35,576
Because you need time and resources to iterate and address the feedback you're getting.

792
00:42:35,937 --> 00:42:39,619
So it's not like every little penny until we release it on early access.

793
00:42:39,659 --> 00:42:45,982
It should be every little penny to release early access and have enough time to address the feedback and improve and iterate.

794
00:42:46,622 --> 00:42:50,004
If you're on mobile, it's more like getting into a soft launch.

795
00:42:50,981 --> 00:42:53,463
And then seeing what your KPIs look like from soft launch,

796
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,725
and then having time in soft launch to iterate,

797
00:42:56,425 --> 00:42:59,467
to build enough proof to then go see a mobile publisher

798
00:42:59,507 --> 00:43:02,930
distributor and say, look, I used my earlier funding

799
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:05,672
to get into soft launch and iterate, and now here's my KPIs.

800
00:43:06,433 --> 00:43:08,554
Now I want the big bucks or the big deal

801
00:43:08,614 --> 00:43:10,115
to then take it to global launch and so on.

802
00:43:10,356 --> 00:43:12,357
So that's an example of what I mean by checkpoint

803
00:43:12,377 --> 00:43:15,479
to checkpoint or proof point, not just, eh,

804
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,402
I need some money to pay my bills for six more months.

805
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:22,945
You know, that involves a great degree of trust.

806
00:43:24,687 --> 00:43:29,031
And oftentimes, you know, while there is, you know, data in your hand, you know, we're

807
00:43:29,051 --> 00:43:34,535
all here at GDC, this is a really community-driven, close-knit industry.

808
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:42,342
One of the most compelling lectures I ever saw was from Nathan and Chris from Cappy,

809
00:43:42,422 --> 00:43:46,905
Cappy Barra again, where they did a lecture called Beers with Friends.

810
00:43:48,809 --> 00:43:51,130
And surprisingly, that was a business lecture.

811
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:57,253
And the point of Nathan was that, you know, fundamentally, we do business with the people

812
00:43:57,293 --> 00:43:57,653
we like.

813
00:43:58,393 --> 00:44:00,214
You know, we, I want to see you succeed.

814
00:44:00,234 --> 00:44:03,515
I think you're interesting and doing cool stuff.

815
00:44:03,955 --> 00:44:05,696
And that matters, right?

816
00:44:05,916 --> 00:44:11,298
And it often is this notion of you're building long-term relationships.

817
00:44:12,458 --> 00:44:13,459
Often what we see is.

818
00:44:15,454 --> 00:44:17,997
A developer wakes up one day and is like, oh crap, I need some money.

819
00:44:19,038 --> 00:44:20,299
Who are the people that have some money?

820
00:44:20,419 --> 00:44:21,600
OK, VCs, publishers.

821
00:44:21,961 --> 00:44:24,303
All right, and they walk out the door that morning and say,

822
00:44:24,323 --> 00:44:26,646
I'm going to go get me some money, because I need it right now.

823
00:44:27,935 --> 00:44:29,176
and they knock on everyone's door,

824
00:44:29,976 --> 00:44:32,316
and you have your first coffee, then another meeting,

825
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,017
then you meet at GDC, then you meet at E3,

826
00:44:34,557 --> 00:44:35,897
and it's like a year later,

827
00:44:36,317 --> 00:44:37,498
and you're still sort of chatting,

828
00:44:38,238 --> 00:44:40,278
because no one's gonna kind of just give you the money

829
00:44:40,298 --> 00:44:41,799
because you waked up one morning,

830
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:42,699
walked out on the street and said,

831
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:43,459
I need me some money.

832
00:44:44,859 --> 00:44:47,660
And as an entrepreneur, if you're not accounting

833
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,661
for the time it takes to nurture those relationships,

834
00:44:51,681 --> 00:44:52,401
you're in trouble.

835
00:44:53,321 --> 00:44:55,802
And so we always like to see developers

836
00:44:56,222 --> 00:44:57,542
that are going really early.

837
00:44:58,482 --> 00:45:01,603
And in some cases, even before you are working on a game,

838
00:45:01,623 --> 00:45:03,404
let's say you've done one game and you're

839
00:45:03,424 --> 00:45:04,644
thinking about the next game.

840
00:45:06,085 --> 00:45:08,925
That's a critical time to come to a GDC, for example,

841
00:45:09,266 --> 00:45:10,606
talk to publishers and partners.

842
00:45:11,206 --> 00:45:14,467
And a great question when you're at one of the parties

843
00:45:14,507 --> 00:45:16,468
and, oh, you're a publisher, what are

844
00:45:16,508 --> 00:45:17,628
you looking for these days?

845
00:45:18,808 --> 00:45:20,809
So don't pitch them your thing.

846
00:45:21,229 --> 00:45:23,110
Get them to talk about what they're looking at.

847
00:45:24,246 --> 00:45:26,467
Because you haven't really decided which hill you're going to climb next.

848
00:45:27,507 --> 00:45:29,568
And those are really valuable conversations.

849
00:45:29,588 --> 00:45:33,169
Whereas a lot of developers will say, well, I've got nothing to show, or I'm not ready

850
00:45:33,209 --> 00:45:36,291
to show, so I'm not going to talk to anyone.

851
00:45:37,539 --> 00:45:38,539
It's a lost opportunity.

852
00:45:38,899 --> 00:45:40,460
Never mind, just on a human level,

853
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,320
you need that time to build rapport,

854
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,460
you need that time to build trust,

855
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:47,402
you need that time to build business friendships and so on.

856
00:45:48,522 --> 00:45:51,603
And so the next tip is make business human.

857
00:45:52,623 --> 00:45:54,064
Think about it as relationships.

858
00:45:54,584 --> 00:45:55,884
Think about it as friends.

859
00:45:55,904 --> 00:45:56,825
I'm not saying you're gonna invite

860
00:45:56,965 --> 00:45:59,305
every publisher, biz dev person to your wedding,

861
00:46:00,086 --> 00:46:01,946
but just think of them as human beings,

862
00:46:02,366 --> 00:46:04,547
not those things that will dispense cash

863
00:46:04,587 --> 00:46:06,408
when I need it when I wake up one morning.

864
00:46:07,836 --> 00:46:12,437
Another great entrepreneur is Eric Zimmerman.

865
00:46:13,698 --> 00:46:16,259
Here in the picture with his wife, Natalie, an architect.

866
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:18,959
Eric is more well-known for design.

867
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:22,921
He wrote Rules of Play, he teaches design at NYU,

868
00:46:23,461 --> 00:46:26,082
speaks every year at GDC, does the Game Design Challenge.

869
00:46:26,222 --> 00:46:27,802
Eric and I used to run the session.

870
00:46:28,902 --> 00:46:31,223
So Eric really is known from a design point of view.

871
00:46:31,323 --> 00:46:33,844
But Eric is also a great entrepreneur.

872
00:46:34,604 --> 00:46:36,746
And so by my definition, an independent entrepreneur,

873
00:46:37,387 --> 00:46:39,889
although now he's somewhat more focused on the teaching

874
00:46:39,929 --> 00:46:40,409
side of things.

875
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:42,812
But Eric ran a game studio called

876
00:46:42,832 --> 00:46:45,194
GameLab in New York City for many years

877
00:46:45,994 --> 00:46:47,776
and was making indie games before we even

878
00:46:47,816 --> 00:46:48,877
were calling them indie games.

879
00:46:48,897 --> 00:46:50,479
It was making casual games before we even

880
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:53,261
had a label for them, casual games,

881
00:46:54,062 --> 00:46:55,503
and was very, very, very successful.

882
00:46:55,523 --> 00:46:59,627
One of the things that Eric really imparted on me

883
00:46:59,647 --> 00:46:59,707
was

884
00:47:02,926 --> 00:47:05,547
being open to other ideas and other knowledge.

885
00:47:05,567 --> 00:47:08,769
And Eric's well known for being really rigorous about how

886
00:47:08,809 --> 00:47:09,870
he talks about design.

887
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:13,532
He's not like, ah, it feels fun, so that's what I'm going to do.

888
00:47:14,392 --> 00:47:16,774
He's in the same school with Mark LeBlanc, Doug Church,

889
00:47:16,814 --> 00:47:20,196
and Warren Spector, Robin Hoedeke, who really think

890
00:47:20,216 --> 00:47:22,577
about design in a systemic way and build

891
00:47:22,617 --> 00:47:25,519
models of thinking about how to converse and share and so on.

892
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,981
And so I think as a community, we're

893
00:47:29,081 --> 00:47:30,562
pretty good about that when it comes

894
00:47:30,602 --> 00:47:31,803
to the creative elements.

895
00:47:32,624 --> 00:47:34,044
And GDC is an example of that.

896
00:47:34,064 --> 00:47:35,365
Let's get together, talk about design,

897
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:36,285
talk about level building,

898
00:47:36,325 --> 00:47:38,406
talk about programming, whatever.

899
00:47:38,727 --> 00:47:39,887
But we're not particularly good at that

900
00:47:39,927 --> 00:47:40,868
when it comes to business.

901
00:47:42,348 --> 00:47:43,749
Inherently, because if you're a designer,

902
00:47:43,769 --> 00:47:44,570
you want to talk about design,

903
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:45,670
not budgets or whatever.

904
00:47:47,191 --> 00:47:49,432
Notoriously, a lot of people don't read

905
00:47:50,072 --> 00:47:51,534
and go to other sources of knowledge.

906
00:47:51,554 --> 00:47:54,416
So I mean, I mentioned the Lean Startup as an example.

907
00:47:54,937 --> 00:47:55,798
Everybody should read that.

908
00:47:56,458 --> 00:47:57,319
And there's a bunch of other books.

909
00:47:57,339 --> 00:47:58,620
There's so many books, of course.

910
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:00,061
Startup CEO is a good one.

911
00:48:00,081 --> 00:48:02,403
Innovators' Dilemma is a really interesting one

912
00:48:02,424 --> 00:48:06,127
to sort of understand the kind of broader macroeconomic shifts

913
00:48:06,347 --> 00:48:07,848
in technology industries.

914
00:48:08,889 --> 00:48:09,490
Art of the Start.

915
00:48:10,459 --> 00:48:13,301
is a good one if you're just sort of starting out as an entrepreneur, thinking about how

916
00:48:13,661 --> 00:48:17,284
do I pitch my business, how do I think about how I articulate what I do.

917
00:48:19,265 --> 00:48:23,669
Another one, business model generator or generation is a good one.

918
00:48:24,229 --> 00:48:24,830
Venture deals.

919
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:29,513
If you're talking to VCs, if you're talking to angel investors and looking at doing a

920
00:48:29,734 --> 00:48:32,155
formal investment into the company.

921
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:36,819
this will be the best $50 you will ever spend, venture deals.

922
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:38,540
It really gives you the full inside scoop.

923
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:41,042
Now, you'll still need a lawyer, but you'll at least

924
00:48:41,122 --> 00:48:42,783
know what they're talking about.

925
00:48:43,404 --> 00:48:45,725
The one I'm reading today is called The Art of Strategy.

926
00:48:45,746 --> 00:48:51,089
And really, there's so many books out there.

927
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:55,793
Now, in isolation, just reading books

928
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:57,875
will not teach you to be an entrepreneur.

929
00:48:59,025 --> 00:49:02,527
You have to be feet on the ground, in the juice,

930
00:49:03,247 --> 00:49:06,128
climbing those mountains, failing, iterating, learning.

931
00:49:07,008 --> 00:49:09,209
But if you're doing that day to day,

932
00:49:10,069 --> 00:49:11,950
grabbing a book and saying, there's

933
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:14,470
this whole whirlwind of stuff in my head and challenges

934
00:49:14,531 --> 00:49:16,671
that I have, and then you read a book,

935
00:49:16,691 --> 00:49:18,412
you're like, oh, crap, I never thought of it that way.

936
00:49:18,492 --> 00:49:21,173
The author has taken the time to give a model to it

937
00:49:21,213 --> 00:49:23,493
and help me see things that I didn't normally

938
00:49:23,553 --> 00:49:24,614
see in what I'm doing.

939
00:49:25,274 --> 00:49:26,354
And so the tip here.

940
00:49:27,495 --> 00:49:30,216
is do not rely on first principles.

941
00:49:30,316 --> 00:49:33,398
Don't rely what comes naturally out of your gut or your head

942
00:49:33,959 --> 00:49:36,320
because there is so much knowledge

943
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,721
with regards to entrepreneurship, business,

944
00:49:39,021 --> 00:49:40,702
in so many elements and aspects.

945
00:49:41,123 --> 00:49:43,524
Now, some of those books and some of those lectures

946
00:49:43,544 --> 00:49:44,965
will not ever say the word game.

947
00:49:45,785 --> 00:49:47,626
So there is a bit of translation, like, well,

948
00:49:47,646 --> 00:49:49,407
how does that apply to game industry?

949
00:49:49,507 --> 00:49:51,088
So there's a bit of work there to do.

950
00:49:51,508 --> 00:49:54,029
But there's so much knowledge, so much knowledge out there.

951
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:57,571
And I think if you thought about all

952
00:49:57,611 --> 00:50:00,512
of the other elements of what we do in the game industry,

953
00:50:01,633 --> 00:50:03,133
if we all just relied on our gut,

954
00:50:03,614 --> 00:50:05,695
that would be crazy to think that we would only

955
00:50:05,755 --> 00:50:06,995
rely on first principles.

956
00:50:07,956 --> 00:50:09,356
And then the last sort of little bit.

957
00:50:10,851 --> 00:50:14,693
Fellow Canadians, Ray and Greg, co-founders of BioWare,

958
00:50:16,293 --> 00:50:19,154
worked on many awesome games of course, which most folks know,

959
00:50:19,214 --> 00:50:20,955
Mass Effect and Baldur's Gate and all that good stuff.

960
00:50:22,015 --> 00:50:25,757
Maybe it's because they're Canadian, but they were always so humble,

961
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:26,837
despite their success.

962
00:50:27,517 --> 00:50:29,818
despite the millions and billions of dollars,

963
00:50:29,838 --> 00:50:31,399
they sold the company twice over.

964
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,100
And a bit like the sort of don't rely on first principles,

965
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,641
I mean, Ray in particular was always like this notion

966
00:50:36,661 --> 00:50:37,482
of having humility.

967
00:50:38,082 --> 00:50:40,303
That things are changing all the time,

968
00:50:40,323 --> 00:50:42,764
despite whatever success you've had today

969
00:50:42,804 --> 00:50:44,485
doesn't guarantee success you're having tomorrow.

970
00:50:44,525 --> 00:50:47,026
You have to be humble and have humility,

971
00:50:47,426 --> 00:50:49,367
you have some pride, but also understand

972
00:50:49,427 --> 00:50:50,708
that you always need to be learning.

973
00:50:51,768 --> 00:50:53,629
And then actually Brandon from Riot

974
00:50:53,869 --> 00:50:56,170
used this term, humbitious.

975
00:50:56,930 --> 00:51:00,932
which he said is kind of the entrepreneurial, crazy spirit

976
00:51:00,972 --> 00:51:03,633
of like, against all odds, I have this crazy ambitious

977
00:51:03,673 --> 00:51:05,514
and confidence I'm gonna go and conquer the world,

978
00:51:05,894 --> 00:51:07,515
but I'm also gonna do so at the same time

979
00:51:07,555 --> 00:51:09,756
and be humble about it, and realize I don't have

980
00:51:09,796 --> 00:51:11,556
all the answers that I need to get help

981
00:51:11,616 --> 00:51:14,778
and ask for assistance and sort of treat business

982
00:51:14,818 --> 00:51:16,739
as a human thing as I go out there

983
00:51:16,759 --> 00:51:20,560
and explore the opportunity space of what's possible.

984
00:51:21,421 --> 00:51:26,324
And so my last tip today is, despite going out there

985
00:51:26,384 --> 00:51:27,505
and wanting to conquer the world

986
00:51:27,565 --> 00:51:29,467
and build successful businesses,

987
00:51:30,147 --> 00:51:33,870
do so in a mindset of ambitiousness.

988
00:51:34,451 --> 00:51:35,832
And hopefully with that, you can all go out there

989
00:51:35,892 --> 00:51:38,694
and build amazingly successful studios.

990
00:51:38,734 --> 00:51:39,274
Thank you very much.

991
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:48,361
All right, I think we have a few minutes for questions.

992
00:51:49,958 --> 00:51:52,280
I'm happy to address stuff that was specifically mentioned,

993
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,781
or if you have sort of other questions,

994
00:51:53,821 --> 00:51:55,182
I'm happy to dig in as well.

995
00:51:55,202 --> 00:51:55,843
Yeah, go ahead.

996
00:51:56,343 --> 00:51:57,764
Well, thank you, first of all, for the talk.

997
00:51:59,106 --> 00:52:01,608
I wanted to come here to shamelessly ask

998
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:03,869
if I could pitch to you sometime.

999
00:52:04,069 --> 00:52:05,370
Are you making a couch co-op game?

1000
00:52:05,851 --> 00:52:06,992
No, I'm definitely not.

1001
00:52:07,232 --> 00:52:08,293
We can talk after, yes.

1002
00:52:08,653 --> 00:52:08,973
Thank you.

1003
00:52:09,133 --> 00:52:10,214
I love couch co-op games.

1004
00:52:10,234 --> 00:52:12,596
They're super fun, but it's not investable.

1005
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:13,177
Awesome.

1006
00:52:13,577 --> 00:52:13,777
Yeah.

1007
00:52:14,137 --> 00:52:14,978
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

1008
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:20,782
Hi, where would you recommend we can find or look for investment?

1009
00:52:22,182 --> 00:52:29,747
Ah, yeah, so I would recommend again looking at my GDC Europe talk on funding models and funding stages.

1010
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:33,469
The answer is it depends, and it depends on,

1011
00:52:33,489 --> 00:52:38,912
it depends on are you looking for funding for the company or funding for the project?

1012
00:52:38,932 --> 00:52:39,453
The company.

1013
00:52:39,753 --> 00:52:44,716
Yeah, so all of the publishers, Kickstarter, all the stuff you were thinking of as project finances out the window.

1014
00:52:45,257 --> 00:52:49,380
So then you're thinking about the company, then the next question is what stage is the company at?

1015
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:54,403
Am I just starting? Do I have a product? Am I pre or post revenue? Am I in growth stage?

1016
00:52:54,763 --> 00:52:59,907
And then each of those life stages of the studio will then determine...

1017
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:04,270
For a city investor in the early stage, where could...

1018
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:05,511
And where are you based?

1019
00:53:06,051 --> 00:53:07,172
Here, in San Jose.

1020
00:53:07,513 --> 00:53:07,593
OK.

1021
00:53:07,613 --> 00:53:10,343
Well, I mean, they're standing on every street corner.

1022
00:53:13,739 --> 00:53:17,081
Yeah, I mean, so early stage seed investing is a bit more difficult.

1023
00:53:17,422 --> 00:53:22,545
Yeah, the thing is that as a gaming company, I have been here for five months,

1024
00:53:23,206 --> 00:53:27,809
and there's not a lot of investors interested in gaming companies.

1025
00:53:28,069 --> 00:53:29,130
So that's what I'm asking.

1026
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:34,093
Yeah, well, because most game companies are not doing some of the things

1027
00:53:34,394 --> 00:53:37,636
that we talked about, where game companies don't have a vision,

1028
00:53:37,736 --> 00:53:41,198
they don't have a roadmap, they aren't thinking about their company...

1029
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:41,499
Well...

1030
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:45,562
They're not thinking of their company as an investable thing.

1031
00:53:46,042 --> 00:53:46,943
And you have to be human.

1032
00:53:46,963 --> 00:53:49,846
You have to have empathy of saying, well, why is this guy

1033
00:53:49,886 --> 00:53:51,748
over here with money going to give it to me?

1034
00:53:52,188 --> 00:53:53,489
It can't just be because I need it.

1035
00:53:53,509 --> 00:53:56,211
I have to think about what I'm doing as a legitimate

1036
00:53:56,312 --> 00:53:58,954
opportunity, and how do I frame it in that way?

1037
00:53:59,314 --> 00:54:02,517
And that's not an easy thing for folks that have been so

1038
00:54:02,597 --> 00:54:04,018
focused on making games.

1039
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:06,000
It's like, what's the business?

1040
00:54:06,601 --> 00:54:07,862
What is the actual opportunity?

1041
00:54:07,902 --> 00:54:08,663
What is that vision?

1042
00:54:09,403 --> 00:54:14,510
and roadmap. So yeah, check out the lecture on funding models and that will give a bit

1043
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:15,371
more insight.

1044
00:54:15,431 --> 00:54:16,112
Okay, thank you.

1045
00:54:16,132 --> 00:54:17,794
All right, thank you. All right, go ahead.

1046
00:54:18,135 --> 00:54:20,418
Hi, Jason. How are you doing? Great talk.

1047
00:54:20,598 --> 00:54:21,259
Thank you.

1048
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:27,247
I have, like, a kind of specific, but you said about the vision, about how you would

1049
00:54:27,627 --> 00:54:34,472
counseled this company to not go for Disney and all this kind of stuff or work for hire.

1050
00:54:35,653 --> 00:54:40,276
We are currently meeting with an investor and he wants to invest in one of our games

1051
00:54:40,356 --> 00:54:45,160
which we try to do narrative heavy, heartwarming kind of narrative games.

1052
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:55,024
But he told me that his intent is to move forward because he wants a company that helps him create educational games.

1053
00:54:55,905 --> 00:55:03,088
So right now I am a little unsure if I should like proceed because he wants to invest in one of our projects.

1054
00:55:03,628 --> 00:55:13,032
But I don't know if I should keep like the relationship going because I don't think that our vision is the same of what he's looking for.

1055
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:13,512
Right.

1056
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:16,895
Yeah, so I mean a really good situation where it's like

1057
00:55:16,955 --> 00:55:18,836
they're putting money on the table and you just want to

1058
00:55:18,896 --> 00:55:21,979
grab it, but if you do that, it sounds like you're going to

1059
00:55:22,039 --> 00:55:24,060
end up in sort of conflict down the road.

1060
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,761
Because like, OK, well you took my money.

1061
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:28,463
Now I want you to go make me these boring educational games.

1062
00:55:28,504 --> 00:55:29,704
Or it's like, well, I want to do these

1063
00:55:29,724 --> 00:55:30,885
heartwarming narrative.

1064
00:55:31,065 --> 00:55:33,487
Like, well, hey, I own part of it.

1065
00:55:33,807 --> 00:55:35,309
So that's a difficult thing to do.

1066
00:55:35,409 --> 00:55:37,630
And a bit like, as you say, the advice I gave to Samantha

1067
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:39,632
was, if you understand.

1068
00:55:40,412 --> 00:55:46,976
Really what your vision is as a company and what you want to do you should only ever accept

1069
00:55:47,297 --> 00:55:49,498
partners investors deals

1070
00:55:50,098 --> 00:55:53,220
That feed in or scaffolding to help you build that vision

1071
00:55:53,961 --> 00:55:58,143
Even though he may be dangling a bag of money, and it's like I'm hungry. I wanted a bag

1072
00:55:58,804 --> 00:56:02,847
It's like that's where you have to have that entrepreneurial discipline to say well. This is what I'm trying to build

1073
00:56:03,287 --> 00:56:04,788
I'm not going to distract myself

1074
00:56:05,488 --> 00:56:08,210
So that's a sort of a conversation you have to have there say hey, buddy

1075
00:56:08,811 --> 00:56:10,332
I mean, I'm not interested in educational games

1076
00:56:10,352 --> 00:56:15,195
This is what I'm interested if you want to invest that because that vision is interesting to you or we can keep talking

1077
00:56:16,036 --> 00:56:22,620
But otherwise it's probably a bad idea to take the money and then later have that conflict or tug-of-war

1078
00:56:23,101 --> 00:56:27,464
Yeah, but I mean always nice to have some money in front of you, but thank you all right Dave

1079
00:56:28,064 --> 00:56:31,807
All good. So Jason, you talked about, you know, sort of, uh,

1080
00:56:31,907 --> 00:56:34,589
picking the hill you're going to scale and assessing its size.

1081
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:36,990
And in general,

1082
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:41,133
we learn about the height of those hills from the flags that the previous parties

1083
00:56:41,193 --> 00:56:42,354
of climbers have planted.

1084
00:56:43,895 --> 00:56:47,978
What's your approach as an early stage investor to assessing, you know,

1085
00:56:48,636 --> 00:56:50,136
hills that climbers haven't gone up yet.

1086
00:56:50,376 --> 00:56:53,297
Like where there's clouds and you don't know if it's this high or that high?

1087
00:56:53,557 --> 00:56:53,997
Yeah, yeah.

1088
00:56:54,137 --> 00:56:58,758
Yeah, well I mean, so that's a bit where the sort of, you know, the guesswork comes from,

1089
00:56:58,818 --> 00:56:58,978
right?

1090
00:56:59,038 --> 00:57:03,839
And so early stage investors, essentially that's the risk they're taking, right?

1091
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:07,820
If I'm a growth investor, well I'm adding a billion dollars over to Riot because they

1092
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:11,921
already placed the flag at the top and it's a known thing, whereas the earlier I go, the

1093
00:57:11,981 --> 00:57:15,102
more sort of fog of war is around the base of the hill.

1094
00:57:16,902 --> 00:57:21,346
So some investors are set up to do that, which means inherently they're going to accept more

1095
00:57:21,826 --> 00:57:22,887
risk, more failure.

1096
00:57:22,907 --> 00:57:27,590
So you need to talk to investors that have comfort around that as opposed to later stage

1097
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:28,371
growth investors.

1098
00:57:29,572 --> 00:57:33,094
And then on our side, I mean, it's part of us trying to be...

1099
00:57:35,216 --> 00:57:37,739
I mean, have our own little sort of half-broken crystal ball

1100
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:39,522
in terms of looking at the trends

1101
00:57:39,562 --> 00:57:40,804
and hearing what the buzz is.

1102
00:57:40,864 --> 00:57:42,246
And do we go VR?

1103
00:57:42,266 --> 00:57:44,028
Do we go e-sports?

1104
00:57:44,048 --> 00:57:45,009
What's going to happen with social?

1105
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,171
Like all these things, you're trying

1106
00:57:46,191 --> 00:57:47,373
to sort of make sense of it.

1107
00:57:48,234 --> 00:57:50,837
And then if you're a developer that comes in and says,

1108
00:57:50,877 --> 00:57:51,919
I got a crazy idea.

1109
00:57:53,112 --> 00:57:58,713
you know, I'm seeing these trends and I think I can build a profitable business that sort of weaves its way through some of these

1110
00:57:59,093 --> 00:58:04,734
Trends, you know, that's like oh, that's interesting. Okay, we were also seeing things moving in that direction

1111
00:58:04,754 --> 00:58:06,454
All right. Let's talk

1112
00:58:07,154 --> 00:58:07,594
whereas

1113
00:58:08,335 --> 00:58:11,195
Normally we get really bored by people that say well

1114
00:58:11,235 --> 00:58:16,296
I saw the flag that riot put way up there on top of the mountain and me and my one other buddy

1115
00:58:16,356 --> 00:58:20,397
We're gonna climb that Matt is like no you're not like don't you know?

1116
00:58:21,957 --> 00:58:25,399
So but that's because we're built as an early stage investor

1117
00:58:25,439 --> 00:58:30,060
And so we're looking for those kind of risky and there I mean the valley has those early stage investors as well

1118
00:58:30,681 --> 00:58:36,103
But you have to talk to those ones not the not the chicken ones. Yeah, not the scaredy-cat ones. All right

1119
00:58:36,403 --> 00:58:37,503
I think one last question

1120
00:58:38,374 --> 00:58:38,754
Thank you.

1121
00:58:39,735 --> 00:58:42,237
So you observed correctly, I think,

1122
00:58:43,138 --> 00:58:46,641
that many of the business practices and ways of thinking

1123
00:58:46,701 --> 00:58:48,142
are portable across industries.

1124
00:58:48,723 --> 00:58:50,384
And for example, the books that you

1125
00:58:50,404 --> 00:58:52,466
suggested that are applicable for any type of startup.

1126
00:58:53,386 --> 00:58:55,408
One practice in other industries is

1127
00:58:55,488 --> 00:58:56,909
that people who know the business

1128
00:58:57,029 --> 00:58:59,131
hire external management consultants

1129
00:58:59,611 --> 00:59:02,013
who know how to build a business who are coming from outside.

1130
00:59:03,114 --> 00:59:05,596
What's your thinking on that for gaming?

1131
00:59:06,357 --> 00:59:06,877
Smart.

1132
00:59:07,017 --> 00:59:08,638
Are you an external management consultant?

1133
00:59:09,819 --> 00:59:14,962
Not in this industry, but yeah.

1134
00:59:15,002 --> 00:59:18,324
Yeah, I mean, I think there's a difference between I'm

1135
00:59:19,585 --> 00:59:21,526
in it every day, and I'm struggling

1136
00:59:21,566 --> 00:59:22,487
and fighting the fight.

1137
00:59:22,667 --> 00:59:24,528
And then I go and grab a book, and there's

1138
00:59:24,548 --> 00:59:26,109
some nice diagrams and some language

1139
00:59:26,149 --> 00:59:29,131
about how to make sense of my daily struggles.

1140
00:59:29,611 --> 00:59:32,453
I think that's valuable, as I mentioned.

1141
00:59:34,034 --> 00:59:36,477
Hiring an external consultant is another version of that.

1142
00:59:36,817 --> 00:59:39,640
Saying, I need help making sense of my daily struggles.

1143
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:44,846
Here's a guru of some kind, so we'll pay him or her to come in and make sense of...

1144
00:59:45,626 --> 00:59:50,031
And there's value in that as well, though it's usually quite pricey versus buying a book.

1145
00:59:52,735 --> 00:59:59,516
Yeah, I mean, I'm someone that likes to get input and knowledge from everyone and everywhere.

1146
01:00:00,517 --> 01:00:06,258
So just sort of treating it as another input point or data stream, I think, is valuable.

1147
01:00:06,778 --> 01:00:06,918
Yeah.

1148
01:00:07,418 --> 01:00:07,618
Thank you.

1149
01:00:07,638 --> 01:00:11,499
I mean, fundamentally, you just do not want to rely on your own gut instincts.

1150
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:15,860
You have to leverage other resources and knowledge.

1151
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:16,540
Yeah.

1152
01:00:17,501 --> 01:00:18,021
All right, folks.

1153
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:20,581
Thank you for coming, and enjoy what's left of GDC.
