1
00:00:05,995 --> 00:00:10,238
Welcome everyone. We'd like to get started on our talk today. This is our How to Run Your Own

2
00:00:10,278 --> 00:00:15,923
Career Fair on a Tiny Budget. We are the IGDA Los Angeles chapter. For context here, of course,

3
00:00:16,003 --> 00:00:20,487
IGDA is a non-profit. We know we're coming from a big city, but our focus here today isn't just

4
00:00:20,507 --> 00:00:24,431
telling you about what we did in LA. It's trying to figure out how we can adapt this so it can

5
00:00:24,451 --> 00:00:28,074
work for more places. We'd like to help you run a career fair, whether it's at your college,

6
00:00:28,414 --> 00:00:29,875
whether it's at your local IGDA chapter.

7
00:00:30,365 --> 00:00:33,286
Or maybe you run your own meetups, jams,

8
00:00:33,386 --> 00:00:34,047
other kinds of events.

9
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:35,647
We'd like you to be able to add this to your repertoire

10
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:37,568
of things you can do to serve your community.

11
00:00:37,868 --> 00:00:38,548
And so where possible,

12
00:00:38,568 --> 00:00:40,089
try to acknowledge some differences of LA

13
00:00:40,169 --> 00:00:41,469
compared to some other spaces.

14
00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:43,350
The one other note is that the context

15
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,590
we were inspired to do this by was the mass layoffs

16
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:48,091
about a year, year and a half ago in Los Angeles.

17
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,432
And so that colored a few of our decisions.

18
00:00:50,452 --> 00:00:51,632
We'll kind of mention where that's relevant

19
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:52,333
in a few places.

20
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:54,833
At our high level, you can see here our agenda.

21
00:00:54,853 --> 00:00:56,334
We're gonna talk about, we're gonna introduce ourselves.

22
00:00:56,934 --> 00:00:58,635
We're going to kind of give an overview of the event.

23
00:00:58,815 --> 00:01:00,757
We'll talk about some of the challenges or constraints

24
00:01:00,777 --> 00:01:03,499
that came from our our venue and other factors, our time frame.

25
00:01:04,039 --> 00:01:08,302
Talk about what worked, what didn't, major challenges, feedback.

26
00:01:08,322 --> 00:01:10,884
And of course, we're hoping we'd have this as a live discussion at GDC.

27
00:01:10,924 --> 00:01:13,806
We'll find some way to receive your inputs and share your stories.

28
00:01:14,227 --> 00:01:17,509
Some discussion questions like to talk about as a group and closing remarks.

29
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,731
And here's where you can find our chapter online.

30
00:01:19,751 --> 00:01:21,472
We are on all of the medias.

31
00:01:21,552 --> 00:01:25,135
You can find us on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Twitch and LinkedIn.

32
00:01:25,765 --> 00:01:29,787
I'm the chair of IGLA this year.

33
00:01:29,887 --> 00:01:30,727
I'm Chris DeLeon.

34
00:01:31,087 --> 00:01:32,508
I'm the founder of Home Team Game Dev,

35
00:01:32,608 --> 00:01:34,309
a worldwide group where people build games together

36
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:34,769
for practice.

37
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:35,969
If they have questions, they work with me

38
00:01:35,989 --> 00:01:36,910
or one of my trainers for help.

39
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,231
Outside of that, I'm also our alumni chair for IndieCade.

40
00:01:40,671 --> 00:01:41,632
And I'm David Mullick.

41
00:01:41,732 --> 00:01:44,513
I'm secretary on the LA chapter.

42
00:01:45,053 --> 00:01:48,275
And currently, I am an adjunct professor

43
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,876
of game design at the Art Center College of Design.

44
00:01:51,356 --> 00:01:53,497
And I'm also director of development at C Design.

45
00:01:54,297 --> 00:02:00,981
And I'm Drew Erich. I run a small work for hire and consulting shop that's focused on online games called Game Breaking Studios.

46
00:02:02,662 --> 00:02:08,026
My name is Tiffany Otto. I work full time with Indiecade and I'm IGDA LA's treasurer.

47
00:02:08,646 --> 00:02:11,348
I work from the business side of things, not the development side of things.

48
00:02:12,228 --> 00:02:13,569
Our event was a career fair.

49
00:02:13,609 --> 00:02:19,193
We have a video we'll share for it to kind of a little highlight walkthrough just so you can see and visualize what we're talking about for the rest of the talk.

50
00:02:19,213 --> 00:02:19,993
We'll switch to that video.

51
00:02:20,624 --> 00:02:24,427
We're here at Industrious Century City where we'll be hosting our recruiting event today.

52
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:28,811
First we're going to check in here with our lovely Drew and our volunteer Quasar.

53
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:32,674
Coming through, over here on our left, we're going to have a lovely snack assortment

54
00:02:32,734 --> 00:02:36,297
and Spatial And, Walmart's experimental virtual reality unit.

55
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:40,781
As you can see, we have areas where our members can hang out, chat,

56
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:42,743
and see if they want to start something together.

57
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:48,454
Moving down this way, we can see that we have individual tables for recruiters to sit at

58
00:02:48,734 --> 00:02:50,635
and see if there's candidates that match up with them.

59
00:02:50,935 --> 00:02:55,916
To our left, we have the Indie Matching area, also known as the Indie Jumble Room, where

60
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:59,637
candidates who have an interest in indie games or creating a new property can see where their

61
00:02:59,657 --> 00:03:00,577
skills can interact.

62
00:03:01,237 --> 00:03:07,298
We have representatives from WB Games, Acapara Games, and Servios down this hallway.

63
00:03:08,065 --> 00:03:12,567
You'll see that we have a ton of lines, and that's actually because we had a really long waitlist for this event.

64
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:18,249
And if you follow me back this way, we can head over to the other side of the beautiful Industrious space.

65
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:24,012
Industrious is an amazing co-working space that tends to skew a little older and a little more diverse,

66
00:03:24,052 --> 00:03:28,373
which matches up with our pillars of inclusivity and diversity for IGDA corporate.

67
00:03:28,714 --> 00:03:31,435
We have a lovely backdrop for taking photos later.

68
00:03:32,896 --> 00:03:34,677
And if you follow us through the elevator bank,

69
00:03:34,837 --> 00:03:36,419
we'll get to the main conference rooms

70
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:39,001
where recruiters who brought three or more representatives

71
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:40,321
have been assigned spaces.

72
00:03:41,022 --> 00:03:43,344
These two tables are listed as conversation nooks

73
00:03:43,404 --> 00:03:45,005
for some of our more indie studios.

74
00:03:47,107 --> 00:03:49,048
We have Fox Next Games in this room

75
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:50,449
as well as Network in this one.

76
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:53,511
In addition, we have TBA Games Inc.

77
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:56,333
and this is our war room for IGDA LA

78
00:03:56,914 --> 00:03:59,155
where our board members can hang out

79
00:03:59,175 --> 00:04:00,617
and sort of handle everything.

80
00:04:01,455 --> 00:04:08,682
This room is a soundproof phone room where Java from DeWitt Street Accounting is giving one-on-one personal accounting consultations.

81
00:04:10,603 --> 00:04:18,170
In addition, we have other conference rooms and conversation nooks where bigger studios such as PlayStation and Respawn can have a more casual situation.

82
00:04:19,332 --> 00:04:27,339
So that's basically what we've done with the Industrious Faith, and we're hoping we can continue this partnership with them because they have several locations in the LA area and they're all amazing.

83
00:04:32,782 --> 00:04:36,326
Yeah, so I was the events chair at the time that we

84
00:04:36,806 --> 00:04:40,550
Started this event planned it and executed it which means I was the point person

85
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,094
So when you're making your own event, you need to have a point person. Let's start with that

86
00:04:45,012 --> 00:04:49,616
But what I learned in that process was there's a lot of requirements as dictated by the event,

87
00:04:49,636 --> 00:04:53,880
and every event space you find will have these kind of constraints. They might not look identical

88
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,164
to ours, but they are going to be there. For example, we could not come in early to prepare.

89
00:04:58,184 --> 00:05:02,508
This was okay for us because we didn't need too much setup. But as you'll see later in our

90
00:05:02,528 --> 00:05:06,531
challenges, there actually were a couple issues that came from not being able to come in too early.

91
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,582
I, as the chair, visited twice and I had a 20-chain email before I actually... I mean

92
00:05:12,622 --> 00:05:18,284
a 20-email chain before I actually got a signed contract out of it. And the paperwork was

93
00:05:18,364 --> 00:05:23,426
extensive because we did have HQ involved. And by that, I mean IGDA HQ because we're

94
00:05:23,446 --> 00:05:24,667
an international organization.

95
00:05:25,407 --> 00:05:29,609
So Industrious got 10 minutes to speak to the attendees ahead of time. We gave them

96
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,890
a mic in a shared space when we had the first...

97
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,222
50 or 60 people in. And it's a pretty standard thank you for hosting the event. It's a chance

98
00:05:37,242 --> 00:05:43,384
to advertise. So we got our event for free, but free is free. And what that means is we

99
00:05:43,404 --> 00:05:48,486
had to have several agreements with them, such as a credit agreement and a social media agreement.

100
00:05:49,122 --> 00:05:52,483
Often, your space, if they're donating it regardless of your nonprofit status,

101
00:05:52,823 --> 00:05:55,544
they'll want their collateral in the major space.

102
00:05:56,005 --> 00:05:59,386
Industrial signage had to be prominent in all of our marketing materials,

103
00:05:59,566 --> 00:06:02,347
as well as things such as name tags, signage.

104
00:06:02,727 --> 00:06:06,348
And when we put the video together later, we had to show their logo quite a bit.

105
00:06:06,848 --> 00:06:07,388
In addition,

106
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:14,563
Industrious offered five days of free co-working on a postcard, and everyone was going to receive

107
00:06:14,603 --> 00:06:18,805
that in their gift at the end. They did end up distributing that via email later.

108
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:23,148
We ended up not printing out the collateral because we just didn't have time. There was

109
00:06:23,188 --> 00:06:28,911
enough bandwidth on our team at that time. But physical stuff is important. Digital stuff is

110
00:06:29,011 --> 00:06:33,993
hard to redeem. No one actually redeems the digital. We highly recommend physical envelopes

111
00:06:34,013 --> 00:06:35,274
that people can take home later.

112
00:06:36,425 --> 00:06:41,969
Gifts help our partners, the people that partner with you, whether you get a big sponsor such

113
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:47,293
as Amazon or if you get a local sponsor such as a catering place, having them put small

114
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:52,076
gift certificates as a form of PR and marketing so you can add value to your non-paying sponsors

115
00:06:52,116 --> 00:06:56,800
and get them to give you in-kind donations even without a 501c3 or 501c6 space.

116
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,240
So thank you.

117
00:07:02,554 --> 00:07:07,538
For example, Jaga, the accountant who runs DeWitt Street, LLC, he does the accounting

118
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:09,540
consultations.

119
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,743
I hate to say this phrase, but exposure was his main value add there.

120
00:07:13,823 --> 00:07:17,046
He actually ended up getting multiple people calling him from that event.

121
00:07:17,466 --> 00:07:21,530
He used specialty business cards that were printed in a different style so that when

122
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:25,353
he asked people how they heard of him, they actually referenced our event.

123
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:30,937
He got paying work out of it and, to quote him, that paid for me getting the cards printed

124
00:07:31,077 --> 00:07:31,998
and coming to the event.

125
00:07:32,547 --> 00:07:37,656
Talk to your sponsors and your partners about what their goals and values are,

126
00:07:38,097 --> 00:07:41,984
because that'll help you craft something that's necessary for them as opposed to you.

127
00:07:42,677 --> 00:07:48,220
Part of why a co-working space was such a great fit as to appeal is that IGDA necessarily

128
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,922
is bringing in a bunch of people, many of whom are freelance people who do development

129
00:07:52,022 --> 00:07:55,744
and might use a co-working space, new companies getting started who might use that as a stepping

130
00:07:55,764 --> 00:07:58,946
stone towards an office, and very much that we could potentially say, hey, we're going

131
00:07:58,966 --> 00:08:02,588
to bring you dozens of people who will get to know your space, your parking, your environment,

132
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:07,250
your location in the city, help make that a value add to them to offer the space for

133
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:07,591
free.

134
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:09,071
It was a good match.

135
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,944
And if you want to make it even more polished and professional,

136
00:08:12,304 --> 00:08:14,446
one thing we actually did is on our entry survey

137
00:08:14,486 --> 00:08:16,248
when people signed up to attend the career fair,

138
00:08:16,548 --> 00:08:17,589
there was a yes no question.

139
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,691
I'm interested in hearing more about coworking.

140
00:08:20,712 --> 00:08:22,214
And everyone who clicked yes on that.

141
00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:26,872
We curated it into a list and gave to Industrious as part of our agreement.

142
00:08:26,912 --> 00:08:29,915
We'll talk more about privacy agreements later, but everyone knew exactly what

143
00:08:29,935 --> 00:08:31,716
they were signing up for when they checked that box.

144
00:08:32,277 --> 00:08:36,200
That was a real value add for Industrious because for them, it was warm leads of

145
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,042
people who already were interested in coworking.

146
00:08:38,482 --> 00:08:39,663
A customized value add.

147
00:08:39,683 --> 00:08:42,565
This is how you look more professional, even if you can't pay for things.

148
00:08:43,286 --> 00:08:45,968
Going on to the venue budget, one of my coworkers will talk about that.

149
00:08:45,988 --> 00:08:50,512
I think the general theme here is working with the venue.

150
00:08:50,532 --> 00:08:52,273
There's a lot of different things that we did.

151
00:08:52,714 --> 00:08:57,015
to try and make sure that we were meeting their needs, meeting our attendees needs.

152
00:08:58,116 --> 00:09:02,517
So some of the constraints that I think we mentioned some of them already, they wanted

153
00:09:02,617 --> 00:09:04,937
to make sure that they didn't have too many people in the space.

154
00:09:05,798 --> 00:09:10,119
They're obviously for venues like that, especially in LA, they can get a lot of money to have

155
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,739
an event of a certain size.

156
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:16,060
So there's a bunch of different things that we had to consider and ended up needing to

157
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,521
cap the amount of people that we let in, things like that.

158
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:20,682
And we ended up with a wait list.

159
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:23,735
There are a lot of other options that we could have taken here, though, that I

160
00:09:23,775 --> 00:09:27,337
definitely would think about next time about rolling people in over time.

161
00:09:27,557 --> 00:09:30,439
Could we potentially have two different start times for different groups of

162
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:34,582
people so that we can keep the event to have under fire code and all of these

163
00:09:34,622 --> 00:09:38,645
things, just different ways to kind of work with within different strengths

164
00:09:38,685 --> 00:09:43,648
like that. A great framing exercise to use is this is a free career fair. All

165
00:09:43,688 --> 00:09:48,071
you have to pay is this one email that you're going to get from our venue. Is

166
00:09:48,111 --> 00:09:49,372
that okay with you? And I think

167
00:09:49,887 --> 00:09:52,508
Nobody likes to get spam, but if you look about the cost value

168
00:09:52,548 --> 00:09:55,189
trade off there of one email versus getting to have a

169
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:57,869
potential career opportunity, that feels pretty strong to

170
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:02,031
people. And then there's a number of other constraints in

171
00:10:02,051 --> 00:10:05,252
there as well, like the timing and like at what time can we be

172
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:09,294
in the venue and for how long. All these things, you know, we

173
00:10:09,314 --> 00:10:12,175
just kind of looked at and tried to do our best with LA traffic.

174
00:10:12,635 --> 00:10:15,456
How do we start the venue late enough, but not too late so that

175
00:10:15,476 --> 00:10:18,817
there's still staff on site at the at the venue and things like

176
00:10:18,837 --> 00:10:18,977
that.

177
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,463
I think the thing to keep in mind, right, is especially for a game industry career fair,

178
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:26,346
a lot of people who are going to game industry career fairs, it's not that they don't have

179
00:10:26,506 --> 00:10:29,409
a job, it's that they're trying to shift into a game industry job.

180
00:10:29,489 --> 00:10:33,073
And so because of that, it's not like, oh, I can do it the middle of the day, their time

181
00:10:33,113 --> 00:10:33,894
is necessarily flexible.

182
00:10:34,274 --> 00:10:37,077
We were trying to account for enough time, they could get out of their work, they could

183
00:10:37,097 --> 00:10:40,360
get home, they could change into their nice clothes, get their business cards, still make

184
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:40,621
it out.

185
00:10:41,201 --> 00:10:44,442
And one of our concerns we're always on the lookout for, well, you don't want your event to skew too late.

186
00:10:44,922 --> 00:10:48,063
At the same time, if you do it too close to the end of the workday, people will look at that and say,

187
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:51,164
I would miss the whole first 45 minutes or I would only get the tail end of it.

188
00:10:51,624 --> 00:10:54,965
I'm just going to skip it. And so those kind of logistics are part of our factoring in there,

189
00:10:55,205 --> 00:10:57,906
alongside, of course, the venues constraints of when we could be allowed in.

190
00:10:58,486 --> 00:11:01,567
As the treasurer, one thing I don't know if we've made clear yet is

191
00:11:01,707 --> 00:11:04,488
we ran this off an impact grant from headquarters.

192
00:11:05,614 --> 00:11:11,578
IGDA HQ has a program where if you're doing something that positively impacts the local game dev community,

193
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:14,721
and they have a list on their website that's very clear, it's very simple,

194
00:11:15,321 --> 00:11:17,663
we have to positively impact the community with this money.

195
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:23,187
And that's how we got the money to run this. This was not a free event to run.

196
00:11:23,207 --> 00:11:27,630
A lot of people told us, well, it should be easy to run a free event, get people to donate stuff.

197
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:31,993
And you'd be surprised at how difficult that was. We did have to take on exterior funding.

198
00:11:32,588 --> 00:11:36,470
It can still be a low budget, but a no budget seems unlikely to really, for that matter,

199
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,551
meet people's needs of pulling off a professional seeming event.

200
00:11:40,411 --> 00:11:41,792
Some things that did work great for us.

201
00:11:42,392 --> 00:11:44,913
I was really curious, David, your takes on the ways that...

202
00:11:45,193 --> 00:11:47,874
Your connection to a lot of the studios who showed up in terms of

203
00:11:48,535 --> 00:11:50,195
the people you reached out to, how they were able to make it.

204
00:11:50,295 --> 00:11:53,557
Can you speak a bit to that process, what those communications were like?

205
00:11:53,957 --> 00:11:58,039
One thing that's really helpful is to have a lot of connections in the game industry.

206
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:00,060
Even before you think about...

207
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:06,335
Thinking about running a game fair, just for you personally, it helps to know as many people as

208
00:12:06,395 --> 00:12:14,061
possible. And one thing that I've always done is try to make contact with all the recruiters in

209
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:18,725
the game industry, with all the executive recruiters that work independently, as well

210
00:12:18,765 --> 00:12:23,408
as with all the recruiters that work on each of the different studios.

211
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:30,543
So when we started talking about having a job fair, what I did was go through all my contacts

212
00:12:31,063 --> 00:12:37,307
that I had already made long ago and gone to each of them to find out if they were

213
00:12:37,327 --> 00:12:43,110
interested in participating. So that sort of preparation that I had done just in case

214
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,132
I'd ever come a time where I was employed, I already had people to reach out to,

215
00:12:48,633 --> 00:12:50,554
that gave me preparation for this career fair.

216
00:12:51,577 --> 00:12:59,699
being able to reach out to people that we can invite to appear and be vendors at our

217
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:01,260
game period to help out other people.

218
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:08,883
I went and started contacting them a few weeks ahead of the event, and one thing that I discovered

219
00:13:08,943 --> 00:13:14,164
that would have worked better is if we had established a date even sooner.

220
00:13:14,184 --> 00:13:19,186
As different venues we looked at became available, and then it turns out we couldn't use that

221
00:13:21,171 --> 00:13:28,417
the date kept switching. So that made it hard to arrange recruiters to come in and studios to come

222
00:13:28,457 --> 00:13:34,641
in. We were able to give like four weeks notice. Most of the people I talked to were actually very

223
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:43,188
interested in showing up. I think recruiters do like having opportunities to go and meet people

224
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:47,291
because that's really what they're in the business for, to go to find out possible people to

225
00:13:47,965 --> 00:13:51,846
to join their companies. So they do look forward to having events like this.

226
00:13:53,027 --> 00:13:56,328
A couple things I think we maybe didn't even organize until afterwards, realizing each of us

227
00:13:56,768 --> 00:14:00,689
in the IGDLA board have different connections to industry, and we kind of built out a spreadsheet

228
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:04,810
of who knows people at which places in the area. And even that's become a useful resource to us

229
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:07,251
for future kind of things to realize, okay, well, we need some people who are

230
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:10,772
VR in the area or AAA or indie or otherwise in the area.

231
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:12,673
kind of realizing just how useful it is.

232
00:14:12,693 --> 00:14:15,273
And that's the thing where if some people who are watching this talk are like,

233
00:14:15,293 --> 00:14:16,354
well, I don't have those connections.

234
00:14:16,874 --> 00:14:20,615
This sounds like an easy cop out for IGD people to say, go to your IGDA events.

235
00:14:21,015 --> 00:14:22,415
There are chapters all over the place,

236
00:14:22,816 --> 00:14:25,316
and there's necessarily a congregation of people who have different connections.

237
00:14:25,356 --> 00:14:28,697
The Venn diagram of which might surprise you of just how many different places

238
00:14:29,097 --> 00:14:30,818
someone can find somebody who, again, these recruiters,

239
00:14:30,858 --> 00:14:32,318
when you can invite them to these kind of events,

240
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:35,539
it's doing their companies a favor in terms of they want to find people

241
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:37,580
who are looking for work or a good match for them.

242
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,260
And you're helping make that match happen.

243
00:14:40,542 --> 00:14:43,763
really helpful for making connections is LinkedIn. You can

244
00:14:43,803 --> 00:14:48,285
go in on LinkedIn and find the in-house recruiters working at

245
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:52,326
just about every given studio. And I've not met one recruiter

246
00:14:52,446 --> 00:14:56,248
online that wasn't more than willing to accept my LinkedIn

247
00:14:56,288 --> 00:14:58,989
connection. So that's that's part of how I build up my own

248
00:14:59,029 --> 00:14:59,329
network.

249
00:14:59,349 --> 00:15:01,590
Yeah, their job is almost accepting LinkedIn connections

250
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,430
every time.

251
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:05,732
Which is actually so building off of what David said, we did

252
00:15:05,752 --> 00:15:09,153
have a bit of a chicken and egg problem. People and companies

253
00:15:09,213 --> 00:15:10,173
only wanted to show up.

254
00:15:10,972 --> 00:15:14,735
if there were people they expected to have a positive impact or that they wanted to impress

255
00:15:14,795 --> 00:15:18,777
on the thing. So what we were like, Hey, studio name, do you want to be at our career fair?

256
00:15:18,797 --> 00:15:21,399
Like, well, how many mid-grade engineers do you have? And I'm like,

257
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,363
I can get back to you with that. And then when we started advertising a career fair,

258
00:15:27,663 --> 00:15:32,526
we didn't really hit the high end of that curve of signups until we started putting

259
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:36,108
known entities and like names people had heard of.

260
00:15:37,073 --> 00:15:41,557
whether that was a local, you know, local Indies that everyone had heard of, or

261
00:15:41,577 --> 00:15:46,762
AAA studios on the list. As soon as we dropped two AAA names on the list,

262
00:15:47,243 --> 00:15:50,826
like our Eventbrite just got loaded out. So that's a chicken and egg problem.

263
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,749
And this is where we say like collab with the local IGDA chapter.

264
00:15:54,744 --> 00:15:56,625
If I can speak to, there's a point in there too,

265
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:58,145
and maybe it sounds obvious and said out loud,

266
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:01,546
is basically if you have some friends,

267
00:16:01,726 --> 00:16:03,406
some places that you're more connected to

268
00:16:03,426 --> 00:16:05,347
that you can ask first and get some yeses first,

269
00:16:06,087 --> 00:16:06,867
it's very tough to get people

270
00:16:06,887 --> 00:16:08,047
to be the first person to a party.

271
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,487
If you have a little bit of traction,

272
00:16:09,587 --> 00:16:10,928
we have three other students who've said yes,

273
00:16:10,948 --> 00:16:12,248
we have four other students who've said yes,

274
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,029
it's that much easier for someone to see like,

275
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:16,289
oh, this is a legitimate thing, people will be there,

276
00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:17,389
it's happening.

277
00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:19,670
So it's before you approach the strangers

278
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,590
who just, you only met on LinkedIn yet,

279
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,651
it's useful to first try to leverage what you can

280
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:24,391
from your in-persons.

281
00:16:25,011 --> 00:16:34,258
Connections through however you're finding a yeah and david made a really good point about being able to parse the data of early attendees to invite companies of different sizes if you realize you're getting like.

282
00:16:35,418 --> 00:16:44,324
A bunch of mid level audio guys responding then you start targeting your studios appropriately we're very fortunate when i you know la new york.

283
00:16:44,905 --> 00:16:51,189
Any of the nordics you can grab your local industry so you'll be surprised who you can pull in.

284
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:52,750
Depending on where you are.

285
00:16:53,098 --> 00:16:55,679
And I will speak to I think some folks probably who are in this area knows I

286
00:16:55,699 --> 00:16:58,520
grew up so I grew up in the Midwest and one of the things that happens out there

287
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:02,441
is that the few meetups and events and cities and hubs that would hold events

288
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:06,202
people would drive from three hours in every direction to be at that thing to

289
00:17:06,262 --> 00:17:09,403
find the other people who are in their region now granted they might also be

290
00:17:09,443 --> 00:17:12,304
driving three hours of LA traffic but it's outside LA but it's like just

291
00:17:12,344 --> 00:17:14,725
because you're not in where there's a major city hub you might surprise

292
00:17:14,745 --> 00:17:17,626
yourself on the people who will fly out to your thing etc to make it happen

293
00:17:18,489 --> 00:17:21,711
All the things that we've talked about at this point are just like, what are the value adds for

294
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:26,173
different groups? We don't have a lot of money to bring to the table to just pay people for this.

295
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:30,495
So what's in it for the venue? What's in it for the attendees? What's in it for the candidates,

296
00:17:30,535 --> 00:17:36,617
the recruiters? So those three sides of it. And a lot of this stuff is around... Yeah.

297
00:17:36,637 --> 00:17:40,519
So we know that our recruiters are looking for candidates.

298
00:17:41,206 --> 00:17:43,007
One of the ways we can answer some of those questions,

299
00:17:43,087 --> 00:17:44,989
even from our early signups, is making sure

300
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:46,409
that whatever signup sheet we have,

301
00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:48,191
we're collecting as much information as we can,

302
00:17:48,871 --> 00:17:50,392
as long as it feels relevant to people.

303
00:17:50,672 --> 00:17:52,173
So we did go ahead and put in

304
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:54,234
as much information as we could about,

305
00:17:54,254 --> 00:17:56,536
like, please tell us what sort of job you're looking for.

306
00:17:56,816 --> 00:17:58,797
What do you consider yourself?

307
00:17:59,157 --> 00:18:00,919
How many years have you been in the industry?

308
00:18:01,199 --> 00:18:02,560
So we can start to answer these questions

309
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,481
when we ask a AAA studio,

310
00:18:04,781 --> 00:18:05,982
hey, would you like to come to our event?

311
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:08,764
And they ask, well, how many mid-level artists

312
00:18:08,784 --> 00:18:09,544
do you have or hire?

313
00:18:09,974 --> 00:18:13,197
And we're like, okay, we have five artists on our signup sheet already.

314
00:18:13,257 --> 00:18:15,939
And we expect it to grow as we put more studios on there.

315
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,141
This is kind of always a thing when you're talking to any kind of other

316
00:18:19,161 --> 00:18:23,104
organization, but if you can start the conversation, asking them what it is

317
00:18:23,164 --> 00:18:27,207
that they're looking for, before you start asking them for things, it gives

318
00:18:27,228 --> 00:18:30,650
you lots of opportunity to be like, okay, well, we want this and I think we can

319
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,912
give you X, Y, and Z of the things that you already mentioned.

320
00:18:33,902 --> 00:18:36,762
My favorite phrase and the most polite way to say this is,

321
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:39,003
so what does success look like for you?

322
00:18:39,423 --> 00:18:41,324
How can we facilitate your goals?

323
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:42,544
Absolutely.

324
00:18:42,584 --> 00:18:43,684
Yeah, use those exact words.

325
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,985
Use those exact words, like steal them.

326
00:18:47,485 --> 00:18:51,726
And then, David, I think you were, you had some information about

327
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:57,128
how the social spaces worked and sort of that sort of thing.

328
00:18:57,768 --> 00:19:01,209
Yeah, well, what really worked in the social spaces were snacks.

329
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:05,770
Especially, gamers love food.

330
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,071
So yes, snacks are really helpful.

331
00:19:08,531 --> 00:19:11,613
But the key thing is without serving alcohol,

332
00:19:12,353 --> 00:19:14,274
which would have been a really bad fit

333
00:19:14,314 --> 00:19:15,674
for a professional interview setting.

334
00:19:16,534 --> 00:19:19,335
So we were lucky that our host,

335
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,016
Industrious, provided the beverages.

336
00:19:22,116 --> 00:19:25,318
Also chose non-alcoholic to keep the insurance costs down,

337
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,498
which would have been $10,000 for the event space.

338
00:19:29,825 --> 00:19:33,746
So you have to account for event insurance, especially whenever alcohol is served.

339
00:19:34,646 --> 00:19:39,267
And co-working spaces do come with their own liability insurance already.

340
00:19:39,987 --> 00:19:43,268
So that's great if you're holding at a co-working space.

341
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:47,849
If you're holding it at a game studio, you have to make sure that they have

342
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:53,630
liability insurance as well. IGDA HQ insurance doesn't cover your event.

343
00:19:54,295 --> 00:19:57,157
because their stuff covers only things like E3 and such.

344
00:19:57,538 --> 00:20:00,520
So you have to make sure that all of your insurance is covered.

345
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,822
Anyway, getting back to snacks.

346
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:06,104
As much as gamers like snacks, they were good to have,

347
00:20:06,324 --> 00:20:09,527
they do provide good opportunities for social interaction.

348
00:20:09,587 --> 00:20:12,669
You know, people go and gather around the snack bowl and such,

349
00:20:12,729 --> 00:20:14,951
and it really make it easier for those people

350
00:20:14,991 --> 00:20:16,652
that don't normally socialize well.

351
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,546
especially since we didn't have alcohol there.

352
00:20:19,926 --> 00:20:22,106
So even though they didn't eat a lot of snacks,

353
00:20:22,146 --> 00:20:24,587
the snacks were still a good way

354
00:20:24,647 --> 00:20:26,227
to get people talking together.

355
00:20:26,928 --> 00:20:28,348
And we also found that the recruiters

356
00:20:28,388 --> 00:20:29,548
hung around the snack tables.

357
00:20:30,088 --> 00:20:33,809
And by doing so, they were able to initiate conversations

358
00:20:33,829 --> 00:20:34,929
with the various attendees

359
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:37,430
and start building up those important social contacts.

360
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,210
There was one company,

361
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,451
they brought six people, I believe,

362
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:43,471
to represent their company.

363
00:20:43,551 --> 00:20:45,092
They had three people in the room

364
00:20:45,292 --> 00:20:46,412
looking through resumes.

365
00:20:47,093 --> 00:20:48,413
While people did their one-on-one like,

366
00:20:48,853 --> 00:20:54,295
Hi, my name is Jenny Job Hunter and I like visual effects.

367
00:20:55,095 --> 00:20:58,976
And they actually had three people sort of incognito, for lack of a better term,

368
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:04,357
hanging out by the snack table and the fizzy water dispenser, just making connections.

369
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:08,098
And they actually told me during their exit, because I did an exit chat with each of them,

370
00:21:08,138 --> 00:21:10,719
they're like, Yeah, we took every resume that came in.

371
00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:14,100
And then we hunted down some people that didn't come in by talking outside.

372
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:19,153
Because it was... They were doing the professional thing, as well as the casual thing.

373
00:21:19,693 --> 00:21:21,094
Speaking of the professional thing,

374
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:30,540
adding a professional veneer or sheen to your event is a major key for getting those high-impact AAA or AAAI

375
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,382
studios to take you seriously next time.

376
00:21:34,923 --> 00:21:37,465
And by next time, I mean the next time you do this because you're going to be so successful.

377
00:21:37,485 --> 00:21:38,505
You're going to have like 4 of these.

378
00:21:40,074 --> 00:21:44,280
We found that making the staff wear the same shirt, ideally with a logo, is a major key.

379
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:49,367
I know everybody hates uniforms in our industry and everyone hates suits, and I totally understand that.

380
00:21:49,947 --> 00:21:52,671
But it made it super easy for people to say,

381
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:56,696
go find Tiffany. She's the girl in all black with the name tag on.

382
00:21:58,089 --> 00:22:02,332
I wish I had an IGDA-branded shirt so that I could wear that and say,

383
00:22:02,352 --> 00:22:06,995
go find one of the people in an IGDA shirt. That's a major thing. It makes it more comfortable for

384
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:11,797
people, easier to find out who to ask questions of. And you got to remember, especially for your

385
00:22:11,877 --> 00:22:15,600
venue staff, they don't know who you are. They don't hang out with you.

386
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,503
We didn't have shirts printed, so we all wore black t-shirts and blazers. Considering it's

387
00:22:20,663 --> 00:22:26,086
gaming, the blazer was a major delineator. And I highly recommend it, even though we're in gaming

388
00:22:26,186 --> 00:22:26,646
and we all...

389
00:22:27,482 --> 00:22:32,907
natively dislike blazers as part of our career choices. It makes your staff stand out and that's

390
00:22:32,947 --> 00:22:37,191
what you want. Looking legitimate during your meetings, having your point person wear a blazer

391
00:22:37,251 --> 00:22:42,775
even if you don't wear a blazer in life, or a black long sleeve that's not faded out and doesn't

392
00:22:42,816 --> 00:22:46,999
have a weird game logo on it is a great way to work with people who don't normally work

393
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,142
in the gaming space such as co-working spaces, beverage vendors, etc.

394
00:22:50,822 --> 00:22:55,206
It's a non-endemic brands like that veneer of professionalism, because when you're in

395
00:22:55,647 --> 00:23:02,352
non-gaming spaces, you're competing with companies like Pepsi or Coke or Uber or like tech companies

396
00:23:02,452 --> 00:23:05,115
and people who have a lot more budget and finance than you.

397
00:23:06,156 --> 00:23:08,698
And then Chris, you had some points about documentation, right?

398
00:23:09,447 --> 00:23:11,228
Documenting the space was one of my focuses.

399
00:23:11,488 --> 00:23:15,510
I'm always trying to document our events to help not just show that we're doing things,

400
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:19,392
but really make a case for next year, being able to visualize it really clearly.

401
00:23:19,412 --> 00:23:23,074
That's why we made that short video about kind of capturing what happened there.

402
00:23:23,514 --> 00:23:25,115
Help secure the venue next year.

403
00:23:25,135 --> 00:23:26,456
The recruiters.

404
00:23:27,314 --> 00:23:31,078
attendees helping them see what they're getting themselves into. We had a couple companies who

405
00:23:31,459 --> 00:23:35,003
sent recruiters and were kind of confused because they misunderstood the nature of the event.

406
00:23:35,564 --> 00:23:40,189
Even having a two minute long video showing this is what it is, here's what's going on here,

407
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:43,854
will help you get a right fit between people who what they're looking for and showing up.

408
00:23:43,894 --> 00:23:46,517
They were still happy they were there, but they were kind of caught off guard.

409
00:23:47,418 --> 00:23:49,999
Legally, by the way, at least this comes from our headquarters,

410
00:23:50,419 --> 00:23:54,520
it is important to explicitly tell people that they will be videoed or photoed or otherwise documented.

411
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:58,362
It's required to document things, at least in the state of California. Your laws may vary.

412
00:23:58,862 --> 00:24:04,344
Depending on your venue or who you're partnering with, that may already be covered as part of their agreement using that space.

413
00:24:05,223 --> 00:24:07,065
That's something where I went up doing that this time.

414
00:24:07,185 --> 00:24:09,327
I've got some equipment for other professional uses.

415
00:24:10,568 --> 00:24:14,450
We did unfortunately learn the hard way that you should not go into a photography

416
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:17,833
community if you do not have a photographer to advise you on the rate you should try

417
00:24:17,853 --> 00:24:22,076
to suggest to try to get help from someone who's professional in that space.

418
00:24:22,497 --> 00:24:25,078
Obviously, good photography is an expensive thing in a budget.

419
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:29,602
And when you're running a low cost event, it might be what equipment you and your

420
00:24:29,682 --> 00:24:31,103
other volunteers can scramble with.

421
00:24:31,783 --> 00:24:37,105
I would encourage not just using a smartphone. That said, smartphones are not terrible and use both hands if you do.

422
00:24:37,965 --> 00:24:43,367
Yes, or you can find a relatively cheap gimbal online. All the streamers have them these days.

423
00:24:44,467 --> 00:24:47,788
Or borrow them from your friend who has way too much photo gear. That's what I do.

424
00:24:48,928 --> 00:24:51,409
Speaking of specialized things like photo gear,

425
00:24:51,789 --> 00:24:54,970
so we did something a little unique with our career fair and this is because we had

426
00:24:56,334 --> 00:25:00,277
people who are coming in from a layoff. So we looked at it more like a layoff workshop

427
00:25:00,317 --> 00:25:08,264
instead of just a career fair. We got Jaga, who's somebody I know. He runs Dewitt Street, LLC. It's

428
00:25:08,384 --> 00:25:12,668
an accounting consultancy firm to come and give one-to-one advice for anyone who signed up for

429
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:16,751
completely confidential accounting advice for free. A couple people talked to him. One person

430
00:25:16,811 --> 00:25:20,294
seriously talked to him, but no one took advantage of his services on site, which

431
00:25:20,574 --> 00:25:22,896
means our attendees were a little bit foolish, in my opinion.

432
00:25:23,892 --> 00:25:27,613
Because a lot of them ended up calling him and he's like, yeah, now you've got to pay

433
00:25:27,653 --> 00:25:28,574
its tax season.

434
00:25:30,275 --> 00:25:34,837
What we learned from that is that that was a miscommunication on our part, mine as the

435
00:25:34,857 --> 00:25:36,438
event chair and us as a chapter.

436
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:38,939
We should have explained more of what he was offering.

437
00:25:38,979 --> 00:25:40,600
You need to sell the good stuff.

438
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,181
We fall into this trap of good things will sell themselves.

439
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:43,681
They don't.

440
00:25:43,781 --> 00:25:45,322
Good marketing sells all sorts of things.

441
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:49,064
So moving forward and for next time, we would definitely highlight.

442
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:54,223
the value add of this kind of thing that you wouldn't expect at a career fair.

443
00:25:55,103 --> 00:25:58,526
So how do you staff an event like this? Obviously, you're going to work with what you have.

444
00:25:59,627 --> 00:26:03,270
And the more the merrier with volunteers. But specifically, the things that we found

445
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:07,793
were, obviously, there's going to be a huge rush of people at registration,

446
00:26:07,853 --> 00:26:12,236
you can never have enough people checking folks in. And that's a great place to have volunteers.

447
00:26:12,596 --> 00:26:14,637
But pretty much anywhere you're assigning volunteers,

448
00:26:14,677 --> 00:26:16,237
you want to make sure that one of the coordinators,

449
00:26:16,297 --> 00:26:17,937
one of the people who was there organizing the event

450
00:26:18,198 --> 00:26:20,218
is nearby so they have someone to kind of escalate to.

451
00:26:20,238 --> 00:26:21,738
Because obviously they're not going to have the answer

452
00:26:21,758 --> 00:26:22,399
to all the questions.

453
00:26:22,979 --> 00:26:24,959
They just kind of showed up as an extra pair of hands.

454
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,860
The other thing was there tends to need to be somebody

455
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,720
that's floating around,

456
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:31,101
checking in with each of these groups of people

457
00:26:31,141 --> 00:26:32,922
and making sure all of their needs are being met.

458
00:26:33,062 --> 00:26:34,282
So checking in with the venue, like,

459
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:37,443
hey, everything's looking good, et cetera, et cetera.

460
00:26:37,503 --> 00:26:39,463
Checking with different recruiters.

461
00:26:40,121 --> 00:26:43,463
we get you anything, etc, etc. Especially the recruiters are kind of locked down at tables

462
00:26:43,503 --> 00:26:48,166
sometimes. So if you can help them out as someone who's a little more mobile, then that can be great.

463
00:26:48,726 --> 00:26:52,288
And just checking in with attendees and making sure somebody is getting a feel for

464
00:26:52,308 --> 00:26:57,731
if people are having any troubles that you can get something, even if it's too hot in here,

465
00:26:57,751 --> 00:27:00,633
you can go ask the venue to turn the AC on or whatever it is.

466
00:27:02,014 --> 00:27:04,515
Having people floating around in different capacities is really helpful.

467
00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:05,936
One of the things we found is

468
00:27:06,395 --> 00:27:09,897
We have a venue that was really actually well set up for this where we could put people into

469
00:27:09,977 --> 00:27:15,079
these phone booths. But a venue like that is really distributed. And how do we tell people

470
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:18,921
to get around? So as soon as they come in, again, lack of signage, but as soon as they come in,

471
00:27:18,941 --> 00:27:23,343
they're like, what do I do now? And we're like, well, there are companies in all of these rooms

472
00:27:23,383 --> 00:27:28,665
there and all of these rooms there. So having a person to basically air traffic control the humans

473
00:27:29,445 --> 00:27:33,867
around the room and into different places. The other thing that we could have done there is

474
00:27:34,367 --> 00:27:35,828
if we really knew the venue ahead of time.

475
00:27:36,198 --> 00:27:40,185
a little bit more printed materials as you walk in, here's a map, you know, like you'd

476
00:27:40,205 --> 00:27:41,487
see at a conference or something like that.

477
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:44,231
And some of that was, of course, since we were at a co-working space,

478
00:27:44,251 --> 00:27:47,673
where if we didn't tell people that some of them might have been worried about,

479
00:27:47,713 --> 00:27:50,074
like, is that just other people who are having a meeting in that room that

480
00:27:50,134 --> 00:27:51,015
aren't related to this event?

481
00:27:51,655 --> 00:27:54,617
Part of what's neat about that same dynamic of you're not taking over a

482
00:27:54,657 --> 00:27:57,919
hundred percent of a space makes it potentially like, okay, so you're a

483
00:27:57,939 --> 00:27:59,579
college organization running it on a campus.

484
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,240
You know, you can't lock down that whole building.

485
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,841
You're going to get maybe a few classrooms or whatever.

486
00:28:03,222 --> 00:28:05,923
You can still have people there kind of direct people like, oh, don't go to

487
00:28:05,963 --> 00:28:06,463
this hallway.

488
00:28:06,804 --> 00:28:08,164
We're all up and down this wall over here.

489
00:28:08,925 --> 00:28:15,487
And so you can have a space without having the whole space and opens up your options for where you could be and how flexible your growth can be as well.

490
00:28:16,067 --> 00:28:25,730
And on the note that Chris was just talking about, when we have lots of people in sort of a mixed use space, making sure that everyone had a name tag was important beyond just sort of the facilitation piece.

491
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:35,833
It's really kind of a security thing, making sure you know who's a part of your event, making sure that they know who's a part of your event so that they're not reaching out to people who are actively working at a desk when we're in a co-work space or something like that.

492
00:28:36,858 --> 00:28:39,560
And I will say as well as those name tags are also potentially part of it's

493
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,022
valuable to have an anti harassment policy or similar types of things

494
00:28:43,102 --> 00:28:45,544
documented that can be up on little trifolds around tables or whatnot.

495
00:28:45,564 --> 00:28:47,766
Something we did not do this year, want to improve for future events.

496
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,688
But basically, sometimes we get resistance from someone saying,

497
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:51,849
oh, I don't feel like wearing a name tag.

498
00:28:52,269 --> 00:28:54,831
It is important for being able to hold people accountable

499
00:28:54,851 --> 00:28:57,152
for someone's misbehaving, someone's doing something they shouldn't do

500
00:28:57,172 --> 00:28:59,474
to be able to at least have some way to tell who was who.

501
00:28:59,954 --> 00:29:01,315
And that's an important part of that policy.

502
00:29:01,696 --> 00:29:03,797
Yeah, that was all our kind of prep stuff.

503
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:07,391
But there's actually a bunch of prep that you want your attendees and recruiters to

504
00:29:07,431 --> 00:29:08,211
be doing as well.

505
00:29:09,751 --> 00:29:13,092
It's obvious things like reminding people to bring their resumes and their business

506
00:29:13,132 --> 00:29:13,512
cards.

507
00:29:13,572 --> 00:29:15,672
And it seems very obvious.

508
00:29:16,113 --> 00:29:19,773
But the better prepared people that come in are, the better your event is going to seem.

509
00:29:20,053 --> 00:29:24,154
Because your audience, especially we've talked about this, your audience is your value here

510
00:29:24,394 --> 00:29:24,634
too.

511
00:29:24,714 --> 00:29:29,135
Because this is kind of like recruiters looking for attendees, attendees and venues looking

512
00:29:29,175 --> 00:29:29,955
for people to work there.

513
00:29:30,015 --> 00:29:33,156
So if everyone's professionalism is higher, your event looks better.

514
00:29:33,256 --> 00:29:33,976
So help prep them.

515
00:29:34,765 --> 00:29:37,465
I think David was going to talk about some of the other lessons

516
00:29:37,505 --> 00:29:40,226
learned for the next time we run an event like this.

517
00:29:40,246 --> 00:29:41,086
Some stuff that didn't work.

518
00:29:41,466 --> 00:29:41,706
Yeah.

519
00:29:41,726 --> 00:29:42,047
Yeah.

520
00:29:43,347 --> 00:29:45,467
One thing I think we wish we had done

521
00:29:45,547 --> 00:29:49,128
was request from each studio a high res logo

522
00:29:49,728 --> 00:29:51,189
so that we could put it on our signage.

523
00:29:51,209 --> 00:29:53,049
Would have made a lot better looking signage

524
00:29:53,129 --> 00:29:54,190
than what we had.

525
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:58,011
One thing that we thought would have worked out well

526
00:29:58,211 --> 00:30:01,892
is that we had an interview room that we called the phone booth.

527
00:30:02,402 --> 00:30:06,606
It had soundproofing in it and that way it allowed people to have private interviews.

528
00:30:07,006 --> 00:30:11,611
But it's turned out that nobody really took us up on it because it wasn't well communicated

529
00:30:11,631 --> 00:30:16,797
that we had that. And then what we should have done is for our survey,

530
00:30:16,877 --> 00:30:21,361
we should have used the survey in Eventbrite rather than having a separate Google link.

531
00:30:22,322 --> 00:30:25,045
Things we could improve upon and that didn't work

532
00:30:26,085 --> 00:30:28,846
We had some individuals, some sort of career coach types,

533
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:30,688
offer to come and do resume reviews.

534
00:30:30,808 --> 00:30:33,009
And so there's a question on the sign-up form that was,

535
00:30:33,329 --> 00:30:35,210
would you like your resume reviewed by a professional

536
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,011
resume reviewer?

537
00:30:36,591 --> 00:30:39,713
About 40% of people said, yeah, we would like that.

538
00:30:39,773 --> 00:30:41,454
That sounds like an exceptional thing.

539
00:30:41,494 --> 00:30:42,515
I just got laid off.

540
00:30:43,935 --> 00:30:45,857
That vendor didn't show up.

541
00:30:46,417 --> 00:30:47,618
We haven't heard from them since.

542
00:30:48,258 --> 00:30:49,639
I hope nothing terrible happened to them,

543
00:30:50,379 --> 00:30:52,741
but they just didn't come through.

544
00:30:52,921 --> 00:30:53,921
They didn't come to the event.

545
00:30:55,231 --> 00:31:01,393
Fortunately, I was running points on this event. So when the people got here to sign

546
00:31:01,413 --> 00:31:04,814
up for resume review, as you could see on their name tag, which had 1000 stickers on it,

547
00:31:05,754 --> 00:31:10,136
I apologized to them and said, our resume reviewer didn't arrive. Can I interest you in one of our

548
00:31:10,176 --> 00:31:15,838
other specialty products? And they didn't remember signing up that they wanted resume review.

549
00:31:16,838 --> 00:31:20,579
People often say they want things and not actually know what that means or not actually

550
00:31:20,659 --> 00:31:21,900
want it at the end of the day.

551
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:25,712
How you can account for that, I'm not sure.

552
00:31:25,852 --> 00:31:28,294
Just remember that not everything people say they want is what they want.

553
00:31:28,354 --> 00:31:31,336
And sometimes things they don't say they want, they decide they want when they get there.

554
00:31:32,036 --> 00:31:47,287
I'll say to that point, if one thing that can be done to mitigate is essentially that if it's something feels like a key value add for our event is really relying on, we're really pointing out like come get VR work or come get your resume reviewed or whatever, to basically try to build in some redundancy, thinking of it more as a panel approach, less as a single point of failure.

555
00:31:47,847 --> 00:31:50,149
Just because what we figured out is just as much as not every

556
00:31:50,189 --> 00:31:52,111
attendee who says they're going to come shows up, not every

557
00:31:52,151 --> 00:31:54,072
studio or service who says they're going to come show up

558
00:31:54,172 --> 00:31:56,514
either. And so building around that as an assumption from the

559
00:31:56,554 --> 00:31:58,916
beginning of like, if this is a key value to what we're doing,

560
00:31:59,337 --> 00:32:01,418
how can we make sure we have three lawyers present or

561
00:32:01,438 --> 00:32:03,620
whatever? I mean, if we can't, then not wanting to over

562
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,743
emphasize that in the messaging as to why people should be here

563
00:32:06,803 --> 00:32:08,864
or they show up and they're upset if, if the only AAA

564
00:32:08,884 --> 00:32:11,026
company that was supposed to be there doesn't show up, you get

565
00:32:11,046 --> 00:32:13,608
mad people if you don't have any other sort of backup plan in

566
00:32:13,628 --> 00:32:15,229
that risk mitigation sort of strategy.

567
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:15,310
Yes.

568
00:32:15,857 --> 00:32:19,318
Speaking of people who didn't show up, Chris can talk about our LinkedIn coaching.

569
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:22,939
Yeah, we were also hoping to have some LinkedIn critiques for the same reason as our resume

570
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:26,200
reviews and like the resume reviews, the LinkedIn coach did not show up.

571
00:32:26,621 --> 00:32:29,482
Fortunately, we scrambled a little bit and created the Indie Scramble,

572
00:32:29,962 --> 00:32:33,683
realizing that some of the people there are really, you know, they're open to exploring

573
00:32:33,723 --> 00:32:37,104
studio work, they're exploring jobs out there, but also they're open to the idea of finding

574
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:40,166
collaborators, getting their own thing rolling out here, maybe meeting with our accountant,

575
00:32:40,186 --> 00:32:42,386
get some financial advice, we would hope next year.

576
00:32:43,207 --> 00:32:46,988
But what we did was we created that space, we set aside if it was an hour or two, and basically

577
00:32:47,008 --> 00:32:50,289
tried to invite people to be like, hey, if you want to meet other potential collaborators,

578
00:32:50,309 --> 00:32:54,510
other indies in the area, go be in this room 2pm to 3pm or whatever we made it.

579
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:58,471
And during that time, we tried to encourage them to go around and introduce themselves,

580
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:02,032
really trying to structure it to be that it's less about what happens in that one

581
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:05,933
event and more about trying to forward some connections so they might follow up after the

582
00:33:05,973 --> 00:33:09,795
fact of like, oh you're also in mobile. We should touch base on is there some way we can connect

583
00:33:09,835 --> 00:33:12,816
each other, is there some way we can collaborate, have you learned some lessons that can apply to

584
00:33:12,836 --> 00:33:16,037
our marketing and vice versa. We did have some people who kind of took over the room in sort

585
00:33:16,057 --> 00:33:19,619
of a show-and-tell format. It would have been probably useful to have had a facilitator had

586
00:33:19,659 --> 00:33:22,280
we planned this event from the beginning and not been a last-minute improvisation.

587
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:25,481
to help kind of coordinate, make sure the time is evenly fairly distributed or

588
00:33:25,862 --> 00:33:28,103
some people who are a little more talkative might kind of take things over.

589
00:33:28,503 --> 00:33:30,264
That said, for a last minute shift,

590
00:33:30,825 --> 00:33:32,466
it kind of worked out alright as an improvised thing.

591
00:33:32,806 --> 00:33:34,707
So if you do wind up with some empty space, not sure what to do,

592
00:33:35,168 --> 00:33:36,769
if you create kind of a structured conversation, say,

593
00:33:37,789 --> 00:33:40,271
audio room, freelancers room, whatever,

594
00:33:40,731 --> 00:33:43,373
you can at least make some of those connections and create a space for them to feel like

595
00:33:43,433 --> 00:33:46,094
it's okay to hand out their business cards there if that's what they do.

596
00:33:46,114 --> 00:33:50,557
And it's kind of a decent way to improvise when you have vendors not necessarily coming through for you.

597
00:33:51,325 --> 00:33:56,686
Yeah. Speaking of vendors, we had a little bit of difficulty getting them to do exit interviews

598
00:33:56,886 --> 00:34:00,847
afterwards. I did minor ones with each company that I caught, but I'd say about a third of the

599
00:34:00,907 --> 00:34:08,889
companies snuck out the back without saying goodbye. But I wish I had scheduled straight

600
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:12,690
up like one-hour video calls with a rep from each studio for the week after.

601
00:34:13,566 --> 00:34:21,992
to get more qualitative data. I also wish we'd done that for attendees to get better numbers on,

602
00:34:22,012 --> 00:34:25,875
did you get paired with a studio that ended up with a job? Because the best metric for a career

603
00:34:25,915 --> 00:34:32,920
fair is how many jobs did people get out of it. And we only have soft data, not hard data on that.

604
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,562
Having said that, several vendors dropped out last second. So our numbers are

605
00:34:36,582 --> 00:34:39,284
a little skewed in that space.

606
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:43,745
And I think part of that's due to the way we handle the Eventbrite.

607
00:34:43,805 --> 00:34:45,765
And I believe, David, you have more info on that, right?

608
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:47,445
Yeah.

609
00:34:47,966 --> 00:34:54,067
One thing we had, which we had done is we'd use the corporate version instead

610
00:34:54,087 --> 00:34:55,847
of our, our, our personal Eventbrite.

611
00:34:56,648 --> 00:34:59,288
Cause obviously one thing is that we wouldn't have had to reinvent

612
00:34:59,308 --> 00:35:00,268
the wheel if we had done that.

613
00:35:00,988 --> 00:35:04,889
We also missed out on the opportunity for collecting donations.

614
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:06,790
Also using IGDA HQs.

615
00:35:09,672 --> 00:35:15,114
event prep would have reduced, if we had decided to charge for tickets, it would have reduced

616
00:35:15,174 --> 00:35:20,056
any additional fees that would have been charged to attendees.

617
00:35:21,336 --> 00:35:25,778
And so that's like on the digital prep, as David was saying, but on the physical prep side, which

618
00:35:25,818 --> 00:35:32,260
Drew's covered a little bit before, it ended up being very heavy manual prep the day of, which

619
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,842
I did not account for as the chair on this event.

620
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:38,275
The big thing was stickers on name tags.

621
00:35:38,435 --> 00:35:41,136
I know this sounds absolutely ridiculous,

622
00:35:41,636 --> 00:35:48,197
but we blew hours manually sticking stickers on name tags

623
00:35:48,237 --> 00:35:50,438
to indicate the disciplines a candidate was working in.

624
00:35:50,758 --> 00:35:51,278
I'd like to point out,

625
00:35:51,298 --> 00:35:52,538
the reason we're talking so much about stickers

626
00:35:52,598 --> 00:35:54,039
is the value add of the stickers

627
00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:56,699
to both the attendees and the vendors.

628
00:35:57,879 --> 00:35:59,140
A lot of the vendors said like,

629
00:36:00,061 --> 00:36:04,443
You know the studios they were like, oh it was great. I could you know stare around the room and see oh

630
00:36:04,503 --> 00:36:10,366
They're here for vr. They're here for audio and they could start up conversations based on the info on the name tags

631
00:36:12,607 --> 00:36:15,229
What that told us is like, okay, we do need to do these stickers

632
00:36:16,609 --> 00:36:21,492
Do we have them do it at the door when they sign in that was already a bottleneck where we want our bottleneck prepping on

633
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,473
the front end or prepping day of

634
00:36:25,174 --> 00:36:28,175
We used an avery tempera template because it was free

635
00:36:29,292 --> 00:36:37,134
which is our favorite word. We bought the name tags at a local office supplies chain

636
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:42,296
and downloaded the Avery template and just plug and chugged everything in from Eventbrite.

637
00:36:42,316 --> 00:36:45,257
There's an extension that Eventbrite uses to make it quite easy to do that.

638
00:36:46,918 --> 00:36:50,279
Applying your own stickers was an option for next year, but the professionalism would have

639
00:36:50,299 --> 00:36:54,301
been less because we actually had set spots on the tags that each sticker could go almost

640
00:36:54,341 --> 00:36:56,161
gridded out and it's a bottleneck.

641
00:36:57,459 --> 00:37:01,547
all over the place. There were a lot of bottlenecks with sign-in and we're concerned about adding to that

642
00:37:02,549 --> 00:37:06,277
because it was kind of, we didn't plan for that bottleneck at sign-in and I think,

643
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:09,282
Chris, you have more information about unplanned bottlenecks?

644
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,649
Yeah, again, we kind of spoke earlier about some of our improv events.

645
00:37:13,129 --> 00:37:15,450
In general, organic, unplanned, if you just kind of leave like,

646
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:18,552
oh, there's couches open, it'll go okay. Maybe, maybe not.

647
00:37:18,672 --> 00:37:21,374
There are some people who sort of professionally are charismatic,

648
00:37:21,414 --> 00:37:24,215
your producers, your professional socializers, your recruiters,

649
00:37:24,255 --> 00:37:25,916
people who just are comfortable with conversations.

650
00:37:26,316 --> 00:37:29,518
For a lot of other folks, and this is true across, we find some of our IGD meetups too,

651
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:33,080
it can be helpful to have some sort of other focal point, structure, topic.

652
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:39,560
topic card, we've run some other events where we just put cards on tables of things to discuss for a certain time and swap those out, or

653
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,602
we've had board games sometimes at our events where people are able to use those

654
00:37:43,022 --> 00:37:45,804
as just something to do, maybe not the right thing for a professional career fair,

655
00:37:46,184 --> 00:37:49,006
but figure out some way to structure the conversation, I think that's part of why we had

656
00:37:49,386 --> 00:37:51,928
a little more success in the indie scramble room than maybe some of our other

657
00:37:52,388 --> 00:37:53,929
improvised, open-ended spaces.

658
00:37:54,989 --> 00:37:58,311
Some of that might be part of the industry, although I think our stickers actually did probably help us there too,

659
00:37:58,752 --> 00:38:00,513
where as an easy conversation starter to be like,

660
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:03,555
oh, you're also an audio person, or, oh, oh, good, I actually need an artist.

661
00:38:04,355 --> 00:38:06,216
in a cup save the kind of moment of introduction.

662
00:38:06,956 --> 00:38:09,578
Run it like people don't know how to socialize as well as you

663
00:38:09,598 --> 00:38:13,200
think they do. Because our industry can be a little awkward

664
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:13,640
sometimes.

665
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,802
They're stressed out and nervous and they're not used to wearing

666
00:38:16,842 --> 00:38:17,542
a suit and

667
00:38:18,303 --> 00:38:20,904
and it's awkward to try and sell yourself. It's much easier to

668
00:38:20,944 --> 00:38:25,407
sell somebody else like oh, my friend Jenny is amazing at 3d

669
00:38:25,447 --> 00:38:28,408
modeling. You need to see her portfolio is way easier than

670
00:38:28,448 --> 00:38:32,511
being like, I make really good pitch decks, I swear. Like it's

671
00:38:33,191 --> 00:38:33,852
it's helpful that way.

672
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:38,501
And then David, you had more information on our major challenges, if I remember correctly.

673
00:38:39,402 --> 00:38:47,965
Yeah, big challenges. You don't only have to consider the job seekers to make your event

674
00:38:48,265 --> 00:38:52,747
attractive for, but you also have to make it attractive for hiring companies. So if they

675
00:38:52,787 --> 00:38:59,249
really want to come to your event and getting the big studios to show up proved to be a challenge.

676
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:03,111
I thought it'd be a lot easier because

677
00:39:03,983 --> 00:39:10,985
I had a lot of connections that I knew personally that I could invite. By the way, if you don't know

678
00:39:11,385 --> 00:39:17,147
connections to invite, what you should do is partner with your local IGDA chapter,

679
00:39:17,907 --> 00:39:21,007
and that's the sort of thing they love to do. They love sharing their connections,

680
00:39:21,628 --> 00:39:27,949
and they can help you put in touch. But even though that we personally knew a lot of connections,

681
00:39:28,209 --> 00:39:33,590
and we contacted AAA studios, and a lot of them had confirmed that they would show up.

682
00:39:34,882 --> 00:39:36,462
None of them actually did.

683
00:39:37,282 --> 00:39:39,523
And there might've been reasons for that.

684
00:39:39,623 --> 00:39:41,584
Maybe we didn't give them enough notice.

685
00:39:42,364 --> 00:39:44,965
Maybe it was because a lot of them were personal connections.

686
00:39:45,065 --> 00:39:49,586
And unfortunately I was traveling at the time we had the event.

687
00:39:49,606 --> 00:39:51,187
So I wasn't able to follow up with them.

688
00:39:51,647 --> 00:39:56,068
It might've been that they realized they didn't have positions they

689
00:39:56,088 --> 00:39:57,529
really needed to seek at the time.

690
00:39:57,629 --> 00:39:58,909
Maybe they had other things coming up.

691
00:39:59,669 --> 00:40:05,653
We don't know exactly why they didn't, but it unfortunately was a little bit embarrassing for us because

692
00:40:06,413 --> 00:40:10,976
we wanted to be able to promote that we had these great studios that would be there and

693
00:40:11,836 --> 00:40:13,117
we weren't able to fulfill on that.

694
00:40:13,137 --> 00:40:18,560
So it was a little bit embarrassing that we booked and set up rooms for them and they didn't appear.

695
00:40:19,221 --> 00:40:21,162
But anyway, lesson learned that

696
00:40:21,682 --> 00:40:24,284
we need to follow up better. We should have

697
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,885
had them sign a form

698
00:40:28,096 --> 00:40:34,767
stay in contact with them and really keep on top of everyone who had RSVP to make sure they were

699
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:35,328
going to show up.

700
00:40:36,363 --> 00:40:47,308
I would add on the other side of that, from the giant studios, the small to medium sized studios, a few I was impressed, who basically, you know, a giant studio like you said, they might not need a specific type of job right now that they see us bringing out in the demographic.

701
00:40:47,328 --> 00:40:51,610
The small, medium sized studios, a number of them kind of came out and said, we just want to get to know who's in our area.

702
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:58,293
Because sometimes they'll add, they're small enough, they're flexible enough, they're adaptable enough, they might realize that once they find someone who's really good at a certain type of talent,

703
00:40:59,017 --> 00:41:01,539
can change what they're doing in a way that the bigger company might have kind of already,

704
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,502
its plans are pretty locked in place. That was actually a neat dynamic. We have a couple of

705
00:41:05,542 --> 00:41:09,064
studios, I think TV games might have one of them who are there basically to, let's talk about your

706
00:41:09,084 --> 00:41:11,726
resume. We're not trying to waste anybody's time, but we're not specifically hiring for this

707
00:41:11,746 --> 00:41:15,629
particular role. But we get on our radar because any given time, we don't know what contract work

708
00:41:15,649 --> 00:41:18,411
we're spinning up. And then they want to have access to those people in their community.

709
00:41:18,771 --> 00:41:21,353
And I think it was actually surprising flexibility from the small studios that

710
00:41:21,853 --> 00:41:23,114
kind of I hadn't expected going into it.

711
00:41:23,636 --> 00:41:26,077
So don't discount smaller midsize studios.

712
00:41:26,457 --> 00:41:29,978
Everyone wants to work at Epic or Sony or Nintendo,

713
00:41:30,258 --> 00:41:33,558
but don't forget the medium or little guys,

714
00:41:33,638 --> 00:41:36,339
the studios that have less than 15 employees,

715
00:41:36,499 --> 00:41:38,360
because there's a lot of opportunity there.

716
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,080
Yeah, I mean, from that angle,

717
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:41,980
I run a work-for-hire shop,

718
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:43,701
and we have that exact problem all the time.

719
00:41:43,721 --> 00:41:44,701
It's like, I have no idea

720
00:41:44,741 --> 00:41:46,041
what the next contract is going to be.

721
00:41:46,782 --> 00:41:48,202
I might need nine contractors

722
00:41:48,242 --> 00:41:51,363
across the entire spectrum of game development.

723
00:41:51,817 --> 00:41:56,000
get moving. And so just having those contacts and knowing that there's people out there looking or

724
00:41:56,060 --> 00:42:01,244
freelancing or what have you, extremely, extremely valuable for me as a small business owner.

725
00:42:01,885 --> 00:42:06,308
Speaking of value, funding, money. Yay, I'm a treasurer. That's what I talk about.

726
00:42:06,888 --> 00:42:11,032
Funding the event is part of why you're here. We've talked about our pitfalls.

727
00:42:11,072 --> 00:42:12,493
Now I got to talk about our fiscal pitfalls.

728
00:42:13,997 --> 00:42:15,759
A career fair charges tables

729
00:42:16,419 --> 00:42:20,602
Charges companies at a table rate generally between one and five thousand us dollars

730
00:42:21,183 --> 00:42:25,026
For a you know, three by six costco table, but to be fair

731
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:26,947
You got to fund these things somehow

732
00:42:28,488 --> 00:42:33,212
That's how they make money. That's how these things like pay for stuff like insurance and snacks and name tags

733
00:42:34,353 --> 00:42:36,214
We used an impact grant

734
00:42:37,035 --> 00:42:38,196
an impact grant

735
00:42:39,116 --> 00:42:39,937
it's from

736
00:42:41,209 --> 00:42:47,811
IGDA headquarters and every chapter can use up to a thousand of it a year. It has to impact the community

737
00:42:48,391 --> 00:42:51,212
You know on screen you'll see the requirements headquarters has for it

738
00:42:52,232 --> 00:42:54,133
It could cover everything from printing name tags

739
00:42:54,753 --> 00:42:58,274
to snacks to possibly subsidizing parking

740
00:42:58,994 --> 00:43:01,535
As long as it's part of something that positively impacts the community

741
00:43:02,898 --> 00:43:10,100
The vast majority of IGDA chapters don't use theirs and that includes SIGs. So it's not just like LA or Norway

742
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,100
it can be like

743
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:13,341
Latinx in gaming

744
00:43:13,701 --> 00:43:15,402
Esports like whatever

745
00:43:16,202 --> 00:43:20,723
Um, it's use it or lose it money. And so this isn't supposed to be an ad for the IGDA, by the way

746
00:43:20,784 --> 00:43:21,984
This is not what this is

747
00:43:22,144 --> 00:43:25,985
but what we found is our infrastructure that we've had as being part of IGDA

748
00:43:26,445 --> 00:43:30,867
Has really underpinned a lot of the stuff we could have done as opposed to four people trying to make this happen

749
00:43:31,647 --> 00:43:32,207
In a corner

750
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:36,392
So pair with your chapter. There's one basically everywhere.

751
00:43:37,692 --> 00:43:42,975
Finding a venue that would take us for free was an exercise in cold calling.

752
00:43:43,195 --> 00:43:45,736
I personally really actively dislike cold calling.

753
00:43:46,016 --> 00:43:48,998
It's uncomfortable. I'm bad at socializing. I don't like it.

754
00:43:49,618 --> 00:43:52,139
I got one response out of 65 calls.

755
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,161
I thought co-working spaces would be useful.

756
00:43:55,321 --> 00:43:57,882
I thought that public libraries would be useful.

757
00:43:59,002 --> 00:44:00,843
Both of those wanted to charge me $3,000 to $5,000 for the space.

758
00:44:03,438 --> 00:44:08,580
And maybe the library thing is just an LA thing, but I didn't realize you had to rent your library.

759
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:12,542
I thought my taxes paid for that. Apparently, that's not true. I tried with friends in nice

760
00:44:12,602 --> 00:44:17,103
work buildings. They had security issues and stuff. They couldn't handle it.

761
00:44:18,384 --> 00:44:23,726
Restaurants needed a buyout. I was like, can we just use your space when no one's in here?

762
00:44:24,046 --> 00:44:27,388
You can keep serving food to everyone else, but can we just take like 10 tables in the corner?

763
00:44:28,388 --> 00:44:31,749
And they were like, no, you need to buy us out for 5k plus the cost of food. And I was like,

764
00:44:31,789 --> 00:44:32,490
well, that's not happening.

765
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:35,570
The local women's club had a venue.

766
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:37,571
They also wanted to buy out.

767
00:44:38,291 --> 00:44:41,352
The LGBTYMCA wanted to buy out as well.

768
00:44:42,252 --> 00:44:43,613
Every community center wanted to buy out.

769
00:44:43,633 --> 00:44:45,293
I understand everyone's got to make money somehow.

770
00:44:45,773 --> 00:44:47,614
But it was really surprising to me how many

771
00:44:47,634 --> 00:44:48,894
venues required a buyout.

772
00:44:49,755 --> 00:44:51,315
I had to call individual locations.

773
00:44:52,636 --> 00:44:55,276
So a lot of things, whether it's your WeWorks, your Spaces,

774
00:44:55,636 --> 00:44:57,817
your Industrious, or your The Wings.

775
00:44:58,444 --> 00:45:00,927
They have an HQ and they also have individual chapters.

776
00:45:01,187 --> 00:45:03,710
HQ for every single organization I called said no.

777
00:45:04,371 --> 00:45:06,213
Bar none, every single one of them said no.

778
00:45:08,496 --> 00:45:12,901
I actually ended up using Google Maps to find the local phone numbers of my local

779
00:45:13,281 --> 00:45:14,182
co-working branches.

780
00:45:14,743 --> 00:45:18,087
Two of Industrious' branches said yes, specific to location.

781
00:45:19,262 --> 00:45:22,564
I went to a local chamber of commerce meeting with the city of Santa Monica, and I met someone

782
00:45:22,584 --> 00:45:26,087
who's the head of programming for the local Santa Monica WeWork chapter.

783
00:45:26,368 --> 00:45:29,710
Now, I know WeWork's not everyone's favorite right now, but they do have big spaces.

784
00:45:31,992 --> 00:45:33,954
That gentleman was shocked.

785
00:45:33,994 --> 00:45:35,195
He's like, what do you mean we said no?

786
00:45:35,255 --> 00:45:35,995
And I'm like, I called you.

787
00:45:36,036 --> 00:45:36,596
You said no.

788
00:45:37,076 --> 00:45:38,097
And he's like, are you kidding me?

789
00:45:38,237 --> 00:45:41,140
This is exactly the kind of event we want to host in our big communal spaces.

790
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,883
And I'm still in contact with them for another event with another organization I work with.

791
00:45:45,744 --> 00:45:46,004
So.

792
00:45:47,474 --> 00:45:52,896
HQ saying no doesn't always mean no, because the local chapters have more flexibility in certain

793
00:45:52,936 --> 00:45:57,177
things. Also, think outside of your game dev network. You don't have to use the canteen at

794
00:45:57,217 --> 00:46:02,238
a studio. Speaking of things we need to run the career fair, Drew, do you want to talk more about

795
00:46:02,358 --> 00:46:06,739
actual logistics once you find the space? Yeah, I mean, there's a bunch of equipment

796
00:46:06,759 --> 00:46:12,520
concerns about obtaining venues and obtaining equipment at venues. Obviously, for a lot of

797
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:16,842
career fairs, it's tables. It might be signage. It might be a variety of things.

798
00:46:18,402 --> 00:46:21,223
I think this is one of those things where you got to understand which things you're

799
00:46:21,263 --> 00:46:24,844
most constrained by. If you have a budget, there are a lot of places that are set up

800
00:46:24,864 --> 00:46:28,865
with facilities to handle this. If you go ask a hotel, they will tell you what their

801
00:46:28,905 --> 00:46:33,607
rental prices are. They'll give you a sheet this long. If you go ask a college, they have

802
00:46:33,647 --> 00:46:37,188
a facilities department, they'll give you a rental sheet of things that are this long.

803
00:46:37,248 --> 00:46:41,589
Usually, they're pretty expensive, but know which things are your constraints.

804
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:46,711
If you are trying to find a venue that you're trying to save money, etc., etc.

805
00:46:47,687 --> 00:46:49,708
Again, it comes down to like, how can I help those people?

806
00:46:49,728 --> 00:46:52,789
Or who can I partner with that's sort of on the inside?

807
00:46:53,729 --> 00:46:55,130
At a college, this is usually like,

808
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:57,031
I need a professor to sponsor me,

809
00:46:57,091 --> 00:46:58,932
or I need a student group who's really invested,

810
00:46:59,492 --> 00:47:01,513
because those people are usually able to obtain

811
00:47:03,134 --> 00:47:05,675
classrooms or gymnasiums or whatever for free.

812
00:47:06,736 --> 00:47:08,196
We had tried to do this thing three, four years ago.

813
00:47:08,216 --> 00:47:10,417
There used to be a startup out here on the west side of LA

814
00:47:10,457 --> 00:47:12,698
that they had monthly meetups from meetup.org out there.

815
00:47:12,738 --> 00:47:13,899
They loved, basically.

816
00:47:14,326 --> 00:47:17,867
They wanted people to know where they were, their brand, what they did to know their people.

817
00:47:19,028 --> 00:47:20,408
And again, that would have been great.

818
00:47:20,809 --> 00:47:22,229
They're unfortunately no longer out there.

819
00:47:22,929 --> 00:47:25,410
But that really does come from figuring out, okay, who wants to be on that map?

820
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:26,431
Who wants those kind of connections?

821
00:47:27,151 --> 00:47:28,011
Somebody potentially.

822
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,151
But this is something where you have to have a high expected failure rate.

823
00:47:31,791 --> 00:47:33,853
This is a thing, obviously, it's equally true for the people out there applying

824
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:37,876
for jobs, it's part of the discouraging process if they are applying for 10 or

825
00:47:38,596 --> 00:47:43,000
20 to get maybe one or two or three options to hopefully consider in that,

826
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:46,142
uh, you know, this is something where a lot of our people that we work with are

827
00:47:46,162 --> 00:47:48,964
coming from maybe engineering disciplines or some other field where if you do the

828
00:47:49,004 --> 00:47:53,127
right steps, the algorithm computes, you get the end result, or you ace the math

829
00:47:53,167 --> 00:47:53,507
assignment.

830
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:58,090
this is a fundamentally a business operation. So it's going to be low yield. And that if you're

831
00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:02,773
doing 65 calls and getting a few yeses, that's great. And there's no shortcut to that besides

832
00:48:02,793 --> 00:48:06,275
getting really used to the rejection. And to point out like again, that doesn't mean you're

833
00:48:06,315 --> 00:48:10,017
failing at it doesn't mean you need to, you're doing everything wrong. That's part of the

834
00:48:10,037 --> 00:48:14,840
process. If you're trying to operate a low budget of that budget translating to legwork instead of

835
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:19,763
capital, you're able to invest in a known quantity like a hotel establishment or

836
00:48:20,123 --> 00:48:22,605
paying for college space you don't have a direct in at.

837
00:48:23,405 --> 00:48:27,446
Mm-hmm. And speaking of business, because I do, I come in from the business,

838
00:48:27,466 --> 00:48:28,987
people doing business side of things.

839
00:48:30,027 --> 00:48:34,429
Here's some tips that I know from my space that might help people who aren't

840
00:48:34,449 --> 00:48:37,711
from that space. Don't use words like unemployment or laid off when you're

841
00:48:37,731 --> 00:48:40,152
trying to get a space. People don't really like hearing that.

842
00:48:40,232 --> 00:48:42,693
It's not an appealing demographic.

843
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:47,115
You have to sell the venue on yourself and your organization before your thing.

844
00:48:48,056 --> 00:48:49,396
The venue wants to know our demographics.

845
00:48:49,517 --> 00:48:50,977
What percentage of your people are,

846
00:48:50,997 --> 00:48:53,438
well, they didn't know to use the word engineers,

847
00:48:53,478 --> 00:48:53,918
but they literally say,

848
00:48:53,938 --> 00:48:55,659
can you give us a demographic breakdown

849
00:48:56,139 --> 00:48:57,319
of the people in your organization?

850
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,401
You know, make sure you can define it before you go in

851
00:49:00,461 --> 00:49:02,561
and talk about your target demographics.

852
00:49:02,942 --> 00:49:05,302
It's not just people who make games.

853
00:49:05,743 --> 00:49:07,343
Frame it as a business

854
00:49:07,443 --> 00:49:10,644
and use business language for product market fit.

855
00:49:11,345 --> 00:49:14,526
Creative entrepreneurs is a good word for indies.

856
00:49:15,764 --> 00:49:19,487
Lean Startups is a great name for two-man studios.

857
00:49:20,327 --> 00:49:21,949
It's not about what the things are.

858
00:49:22,029 --> 00:49:28,133
It's about how they're presented that count.

859
00:49:28,154 --> 00:49:33,178
An example we use and why industrious liked us is like, oh, we skew high mail, but compared

860
00:49:33,218 --> 00:49:35,639
to our industry average, we're actually quite diverse.

861
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,061
You show a state of comparison between two things.

862
00:49:38,101 --> 00:49:39,062
People love that.

863
00:49:40,483 --> 00:49:41,945
Early mid-twenties.

864
00:49:43,983 --> 00:49:51,164
has college degrees, like the way you can slice and dice your people, the more ways you can slice

865
00:49:51,204 --> 00:49:54,685
and dice it and the way you can present said slicing and dicing will really assist you in

866
00:49:54,725 --> 00:50:01,487
getting what you need. And then David, you were talking more about, you know, trying to get free

867
00:50:01,527 --> 00:50:09,308
stuff and how to market it and all that. Yeah, well, particularly getting the venues because

868
00:50:10,756 --> 00:50:15,077
Only until you actually have a place you're going to hold the event, can you really get people to

869
00:50:15,097 --> 00:50:19,578
agree to actually come to it. So the venue is probably the most important thing of all.

870
00:50:20,378 --> 00:50:27,700
And you know, everyone says they know somebody, they know some place. It's real easy. I have a

871
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:32,121
place I know I can get a free venue at, but when it really comes down to it, it's really tough.

872
00:50:32,161 --> 00:50:38,263
As Tiffany just said, she made over 60 calls and nobody wanted to do it.

873
00:50:38,862 --> 00:50:43,825
Even despite dangling a little carrot of because we're a non-profit they might save as much as like

874
00:50:43,885 --> 00:50:48,207
$3,000 hot beer taxes that that still wasn't able to do it. I went and uh,

875
00:50:48,787 --> 00:50:52,089
I looked at a number of different restaurants that we could hold it at but

876
00:50:53,329 --> 00:50:58,512
The noise level was too high. I thought for for holding meetings and holding interviews

877
00:50:59,392 --> 00:51:01,673
And some of the foot traffic was really poor

878
00:51:03,314 --> 00:51:07,596
People getting in and out that's that's something you really have to consider the flow of the people within the place

879
00:51:08,557 --> 00:51:13,238
A lot of people say that uh, oh, let's we can hold it at a university or a college

880
00:51:13,918 --> 00:51:18,499
Easier said than done turns out universities book their spaces way in advance

881
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:23,341
And we tried a number of them and we weren't lucky. Also, there's tremendous parking problems

882
00:51:23,961 --> 00:51:25,061
often at universities

883
00:51:25,681 --> 00:51:29,042
you really have to consider your venue first consider such things as

884
00:51:29,882 --> 00:51:31,643
Who you know who you can contact?

885
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:36,964
Give them a lot get a lot of advance notice because places get booked booked up

886
00:51:37,684 --> 00:51:38,304
Very early

887
00:51:39,634 --> 00:51:42,116
no matter what type of place you're holding it at,

888
00:51:42,436 --> 00:51:45,138
as much advance notice for booking things in

889
00:51:45,518 --> 00:51:50,042
is really helpful. Consider how people are going to move, where you're going to

890
00:51:50,082 --> 00:51:54,025
set up stations, and parking. Yeah, two quick notes on

891
00:51:54,045 --> 00:51:56,968
that are, for one thing, one of the reasons why the university is so

892
00:51:57,028 --> 00:52:00,010
important to have that connection, like was said earlier, kind of a

893
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:01,171
professor's pet project.

894
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:04,953
is that anytime companies are coming onto a college campus,

895
00:52:05,214 --> 00:52:07,236
that college campus wants to charge those companies.

896
00:52:07,837 --> 00:52:09,259
That's part of how they operate on.

897
00:52:09,279 --> 00:52:10,520
They're accessing their students

898
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:12,182
and they're essentially clients and so on.

899
00:52:12,823 --> 00:52:13,784
And so that's where it needs to be.

900
00:52:13,804 --> 00:52:15,466
It's like we said, sort of an in over there.

901
00:52:16,047 --> 00:52:17,729
In terms of snacks, another thing to keep in mind,

902
00:52:17,769 --> 00:52:18,911
and we did not do this in this case,

903
00:52:18,951 --> 00:52:20,052
but I remember a few years back,

904
00:52:20,993 --> 00:52:22,654
some small, I think it was a game jam or whatever,

905
00:52:22,974 --> 00:52:25,696
hit up my small company at the time I was just getting started out

906
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,037
to sponsor their snacks, which like,

907
00:52:28,958 --> 00:52:32,160
uh, okay, the thing is, if you try to hit up a giant company, they're not gonna hand you snack money.

908
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:35,502
A small company was like, yeah, I can spare 50 or 100 bucks on snacks, which is

909
00:52:35,882 --> 00:52:38,063
not a bunch of money to even a beginning company,

910
00:52:38,424 --> 00:52:42,386
but it felt cool to get my name on there, you might be surprised, again, it's like, the people who show up sometimes,

911
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:46,068
the small companies, the approval is the only person you're talking to, and they're like,

912
00:52:46,469 --> 00:52:48,090
yeah, I can do that, here's a check.

913
00:52:49,194 --> 00:52:50,696
And so you might be surprised that here and there

914
00:52:50,736 --> 00:52:52,318
might be able to add up on funding some snacks

915
00:52:52,338 --> 00:52:53,760
that's not coming out of your pocket

916
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:55,442
or your tiny budget you're already working from.

917
00:52:56,243 --> 00:52:57,745
In terms of our parking barrier bottleneck,

918
00:52:57,765 --> 00:52:59,528
again, we kind of knew this was an LA challenge.

919
00:53:00,169 --> 00:53:01,310
It was expensive parking.

920
00:53:02,355 --> 00:53:04,717
And so much so that we did receive some hate mail,

921
00:53:05,118 --> 00:53:06,739
some people were frustrated at the cost,

922
00:53:06,839 --> 00:53:08,481
especially knowing it was for people

923
00:53:08,521 --> 00:53:10,002
who are in a laid off situation.

924
00:53:10,563 --> 00:53:11,484
When you're doing things,

925
00:53:11,584 --> 00:53:14,307
it's going to attract some opinions of it.

926
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,848
And that's gonna always come with you doing anything.

927
00:53:15,888 --> 00:53:16,929
There's gonna be a range of people.

928
00:53:16,949 --> 00:53:17,630
Some people like it.

929
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:18,811
Some people wish it was done differently.

930
00:53:19,699 --> 00:53:23,561
kind of having to kind of accept that part of it is absorbing some blame and that's hopefully still

931
00:53:23,601 --> 00:53:28,264
the positives that way the negatives of the good that you're doing and so it's also being just

932
00:53:28,704 --> 00:53:33,087
simply empathetic to the fact that when you're trying to help people who are necessarily laid

933
00:53:33,187 --> 00:53:36,889
off between work still trying to find the first footing and maybe people who are coming from

934
00:53:36,929 --> 00:53:42,973
they're in stressful situations they are counting on certain things so being patient with that as

935
00:53:42,993 --> 00:53:46,134
you're trying to to help people and do all you can to help the community.

936
00:53:46,575 --> 00:53:51,218
that that's part of the process and the cost kind of factor into what goes into doing it.

937
00:53:51,618 --> 00:53:54,720
In terms of printing, we were very fortunate once again, here's a place where our host

938
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:58,883
Industrious was able to deliver. They actually offered to do our printing for us that included

939
00:53:58,903 --> 00:54:02,725
like a massive Kinko's like banner. But as long as you know, those things early on of like,

940
00:54:03,185 --> 00:54:07,008
potentially our venue might be able to account for some of those services. If you can sort

941
00:54:07,028 --> 00:54:09,329
those things out sooner rather than later might be able to better take advantage of those kind

942
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:15,133
of opportunities. I think Drew some PR marketing thoughts. Yeah. Generally, I thought

943
00:54:15,939 --> 00:54:22,221
We were really happy. The event seemed to be successful for our size. But we needed to leverage

944
00:54:22,961 --> 00:54:27,523
our presence online and all of these things better. We needed to get the messaging out in

945
00:54:27,563 --> 00:54:32,285
more different ways. Something that I think people don't often think about. You obviously

946
00:54:32,305 --> 00:54:35,926
have Facebook and Instagram or whatever people are Twitter, if people are following you on.

947
00:54:35,966 --> 00:54:40,227
But for professional events, LinkedIn is huge. If you're a job seeker, you're on LinkedIn. If

948
00:54:40,247 --> 00:54:43,648
you're a recruiter, you're on LinkedIn. So we didn't have our LinkedIn presence.

949
00:54:44,172 --> 00:54:48,736
up to date at that time. And we didn't really grow it as much as we could have. And if we

950
00:54:48,756 --> 00:54:52,478
were to leverage that for our next event, which I hope we can, I think that'll be really powerful.

951
00:54:53,479 --> 00:54:56,261
On top of that, there's a lot more data we could have been gathering.

952
00:54:57,562 --> 00:55:01,264
That Eventbrite, we funneled things in from Facebook and from Twitter and things like that.

953
00:55:01,585 --> 00:55:07,689
If we were to just use backlinks or shorten URLs with data attached to them, we'd absolutely be

954
00:55:07,729 --> 00:55:11,852
able to know, okay, most of our traffic is coming from Twitter. So maybe we should spend more effort

955
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:12,052
there.

956
00:55:12,427 --> 00:55:15,790
it's coming from our mailing list. Let's see how we can grow our mailing list." That kind of thing,

957
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:20,333
just to focus our efforts. Because anytime you're working with non-profits or small companies or

958
00:55:20,353 --> 00:55:24,475
whatever, you get into this space where you're doing a shotgun approach to marketing. And it's

959
00:55:24,495 --> 00:55:28,838
a very high effort operation. But if you're able to know which pieces are giving you the value,

960
00:55:28,898 --> 00:55:31,640
you could save yourself a lot of time and honestly, you can be a lot more successful

961
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:34,382
investing in the one thing that's giving you the most outcomes.

962
00:55:34,869 --> 00:55:39,253
On the other side of getting people to show up, we kind of knew building into the plans.

963
00:55:39,653 --> 00:55:43,456
Like any event, not everyone who says they're going to RSVP on Facebook or Eventbrite is

964
00:55:43,496 --> 00:55:44,236
actually going to be there.

965
00:55:44,857 --> 00:55:48,340
And first off, we just kind of Googled average rate of people who don't show up for Eventbrite.

966
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:53,824
We found about 40 to 50 percent, which is also consistent with our casual meetups as

967
00:55:53,844 --> 00:55:58,728
a chapter we hold anyway, in terms of we might have 20 to 30 shows for an event that 50 people

968
00:55:58,768 --> 00:56:00,089
respond yes to.

969
00:56:00,429 --> 00:56:01,810
So it seemed to kind of live up to our expectations.

970
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:08,595
And so, you know, going off of that, the attendees getting specific data in advance from the people who say they're coming

971
00:56:08,956 --> 00:56:11,377
Is really important. We sent out a pre-vetting survey

972
00:56:12,138 --> 00:56:17,041
But the problem is people didn't want to fill it in or they just put in gibberish or made stuff up

973
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:20,503
Borking our data like it would say like what do you do for work?

974
00:56:20,523 --> 00:56:24,065
You know artist engineer audio other and they put like

975
00:56:24,546 --> 00:56:27,528
Unicorns and i'm like that is not a sticker. I have

976
00:56:28,248 --> 00:56:29,689
In front of me to put on your name tag

977
00:56:30,525 --> 00:56:36,732
And it wasn't until we started parsing that data and looking at some of the charts that Eventbrite generates, I was just like, oh, no.

978
00:56:37,593 --> 00:56:49,147
Speaking of, oh, no, you got to be ready to hold your ground politely and appropriately as people try to push or bully you into comping things that you shouldn't.

979
00:56:49,748 --> 00:56:50,769
I'm going to say this right now.

980
00:56:52,145 --> 00:56:55,307
It is not industry standard to comp anything at a career fair.

981
00:56:55,587 --> 00:57:02,052
Do not let anyone tell you otherwise, whether it's parking or their parking ticket or whatever.

982
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:06,291
There is a clear management of expectations in terms of I think our page might even be

983
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:10,933
probably all capitals like parking is X amount which is a double digit expensive amount.

984
00:57:11,253 --> 00:57:13,694
We encourage ride shares or public transit etc.

985
00:57:14,214 --> 00:57:17,776
Giving them a heads up helps make it easy if you have to afterwards to point to the

986
00:57:17,796 --> 00:57:21,557
thing and be like you opted to do the thing we let you know.

987
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:26,664
just kind of helps prevent or reduce and manage as many of those conversations you can have.

988
00:57:27,144 --> 00:57:30,747
We did have, in terms of feedback we received, some positive feedback.

989
00:57:30,807 --> 00:57:35,051
So we had mentioned earlier our friend, the financial advisor, who did not get as many

990
00:57:35,071 --> 00:57:38,634
interactions as we were hoping for him during the event, but we did have people hit him

991
00:57:38,674 --> 00:57:41,677
up after the event to do their taxes for their company this year.

992
00:57:41,697 --> 00:57:43,639
So it's still a worthwhile thing for him to be out there.

993
00:57:44,259 --> 00:57:45,801
sharing those business cards, making those connections.

994
00:57:46,621 --> 00:57:48,883
We're trying to figure out a better way to get follow up from

995
00:57:49,544 --> 00:57:50,825
our different organizations that were there.

996
00:57:50,885 --> 00:57:52,747
We know it was valuable for some of them, but we would love to.

997
00:57:52,907 --> 00:57:54,629
This is where we would share some quotes if we had them.

998
00:57:55,369 --> 00:57:58,112
Like we said, a lot of them kind of ghosted us on the surveys after the fact.

999
00:57:58,152 --> 00:58:00,154
They kind of felt like they built up for an event.

1000
00:58:00,234 --> 00:58:01,315
They were done. They were exhausted.

1001
00:58:01,355 --> 00:58:02,956
Granted, they got other priorities to go to next.

1002
00:58:03,497 --> 00:58:05,638
But working out a way to get that sort of notes from them,

1003
00:58:05,938 --> 00:58:08,640
just like it's valuable for us to document the event on video and show,

1004
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,181
look, this is a real thing that happens.

1005
00:58:10,861 --> 00:58:13,683
Getting those sort of quotes and feedback, we might be trying to find still ways

1006
00:58:14,003 --> 00:58:17,245
yet to get a hold of them, to get some notes of how valuable it was in retrospect.

1007
00:58:17,706 --> 00:58:19,587
Those help you land new venues next time.

1008
00:58:19,627 --> 00:58:22,249
Those help you sell the event to other people who might come out.

1009
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:25,130
Those are important and worth finding ways to figure out.

1010
00:58:25,491 --> 00:58:27,512
We have not cracked that puzzle, but we acknowledge that's a thing

1011
00:58:27,532 --> 00:58:28,633
we are trying to improve at.

1012
00:58:29,293 --> 00:58:30,554
There were some studios that were unhappy.

1013
00:58:31,652 --> 00:58:32,833
with the clientele we brought in,

1014
00:58:33,473 --> 00:58:34,495
we might handwave and say to an extent

1015
00:58:34,515 --> 00:58:35,916
there's only so much we can control about that.

1016
00:58:36,537 --> 00:58:38,338
There was one who wanted some very high level people,

1017
00:58:38,759 --> 00:58:40,621
but here's a case where even there,

1018
00:58:40,761 --> 00:58:42,002
we could have managed expectations better

1019
00:58:42,202 --> 00:58:43,704
if we had been able to get that company

1020
00:58:43,744 --> 00:58:45,186
to fill out their pre-survey,

1021
00:58:45,626 --> 00:58:46,747
where they did not let us know

1022
00:58:46,787 --> 00:58:47,668
that's who they're looking for

1023
00:58:47,768 --> 00:58:49,670
until it was sort of already too late.

1024
00:58:50,714 --> 00:58:52,516
Managing expectations and stuff is important.

1025
00:58:52,736 --> 00:58:55,638
And on that note, we actually had a midsize studio

1026
00:58:55,678 --> 00:58:56,559
who really loved us.

1027
00:58:56,619 --> 00:58:58,240
They were incredibly happy with their experience

1028
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,642
and they didn't expect to be so happy with their experience.

1029
00:59:01,142 --> 00:59:02,884
They not only found who they wanted,

1030
00:59:03,304 --> 00:59:05,345
but also people they didn't realize they wanted.

1031
00:59:05,365 --> 00:59:07,387
And they added it to their database later

1032
00:59:07,467 --> 00:59:08,508
for when they got back to HQ,

1033
00:59:08,528 --> 00:59:09,569
because they knew they'd be hiring

1034
00:59:09,589 --> 00:59:10,930
in a couple months for those roles.

1035
00:59:12,327 --> 00:59:16,890
Right on. In terms of getting our logistics out, again, we hit up basically every channel we could.

1036
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:22,973
We also, we had our town hall a couple months prior, and we really tried to drill in there that this was an important event coming up on the calendar.

1037
00:59:23,374 --> 00:59:26,616
So it can be an opportunity to kind of basically build up to that event.

1038
00:59:26,636 --> 00:59:29,197
So by the time it's coming up, people are asking about when's that going on?

1039
00:59:29,217 --> 00:59:30,358
I heard that's a thing that's happening.

1040
00:59:30,718 --> 00:59:33,440
And we did see some of that response on our Facebook event, which I think was helpful to us.

1041
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:38,862
We didn't charge people. Again, our context here was this, we're mostly large, trying to create this to help people relate off.

1042
00:59:39,362 --> 00:59:44,264
That said, there is some sort of trade-offs between if you charge even a nominal amount, maybe $3, maybe $5.

1043
00:59:45,044 --> 00:59:47,846
We have some internal dialogues about if it makes sense for us to do it for our next one.

1044
00:59:48,366 --> 00:59:51,887
Obviously, you're going to get fewer respondents, but you might have a much higher rate of people who feel like,

1045
00:59:51,967 --> 00:59:53,608
I paid for this, I'm going to show up.

1046
00:59:54,028 --> 00:59:58,551
and you might have a much better therefore hit rate on promising your attendee or your company's coming

1047
00:59:58,831 --> 01:00:02,714
who's going to be there based on they paid for it, they're probably going to be here

1048
01:00:02,894 --> 01:00:04,075
even if it's not a huge amount.

1049
01:00:04,476 --> 01:00:06,477
For volunteers, it's good to ask them at least a month in advance

1050
01:00:06,997 --> 01:00:09,539
even if they're people who are not necessarily specialists with a camera

1051
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,121
or other kinds of certain work

1052
01:00:11,501 --> 01:00:14,663
it's still the case even if it's something you could be doing but a volunteer could do it instead

1053
01:00:15,103 --> 01:00:17,866
that frees you up to do work that they might not be able to take care of based on

1054
01:00:18,206 --> 01:00:19,767
who they know there, who they invited there

1055
01:00:20,127 --> 01:00:23,189
stuff that you have the authority as the person facilitating or administering it.

1056
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:28,757
to take care of. I've got a couple notes from I think David on pre pre recording some email

1057
01:00:28,777 --> 01:00:33,804
correspondences. Yeah, it's important to have a good communications plan when you're holding an

1058
01:00:33,864 --> 01:00:39,151
event like this. And so it helps to to write out plan out what emails you're going to send and

1059
01:00:39,191 --> 01:00:41,274
write them out well ahead of time because you find when you're.

1060
01:00:42,456 --> 01:00:45,737
When you're preparing for an event like this, you don't have time to think about these things.

1061
01:00:45,757 --> 01:00:51,419
So plan out your emails ahead of time, like write an email to send out to thank people when they signed up,

1062
01:00:51,879 --> 01:00:56,501
then maybe another one five days or a week before,

1063
01:00:56,741 --> 01:01:01,143
10 or 14 days before, and then 24 hours before the event.

1064
01:01:01,663 --> 01:01:06,605
Just continue reminders so that people don't forget about it and to build up the anticipation for the event.

1065
01:01:07,403 --> 01:01:11,005
A note I want to add about those pre-scheduling the emails is so important because you'll

1066
01:01:11,045 --> 01:01:15,627
be exhausted. You'll be scrambling just before it. You'll be tired right after it. If you've

1067
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:18,788
written them a few weeks in advance, it may not seem fun or easy to do, but it lets you

1068
01:01:19,328 --> 01:01:21,589
not stress out about it at the time and the emails will still go out.

1069
01:01:22,389 --> 01:01:26,491
Yeah, and the same way that you want to schedule stuff beforehand and send out emails to prep

1070
01:01:26,531 --> 01:01:30,472
people, it's really helpful to send one out afterwards just to thank you to people, make

1071
01:01:30,492 --> 01:01:31,933
sure the last interaction is positive.

1072
01:01:33,075 --> 01:01:34,836
kind of keep up that relationship for the next time.

1073
01:01:34,916 --> 01:01:35,897
If it's a recruiter or whatever,

1074
01:01:35,917 --> 01:01:36,958
the next time you're hosting an event,

1075
01:01:36,998 --> 01:01:38,059
we need to contact them again.

1076
01:01:38,959 --> 01:01:40,761
And that's also a great opportunity

1077
01:01:40,781 --> 01:01:41,742
to kind of share some of the data

1078
01:01:41,762 --> 01:01:42,862
that you've gathered at this point

1079
01:01:42,923 --> 01:01:44,564
and provide extra value back to these people,

1080
01:01:45,084 --> 01:01:47,226
whether it's a venue and telling them who showed up

1081
01:01:47,246 --> 01:01:50,328
or recruiters giving them a list of the candidates, et cetera.

1082
01:01:51,449 --> 01:01:57,435
And there's some sort of nuts and bolts technical stuff as well in terms of verbiage, strategy,

1083
01:01:57,535 --> 01:02:01,419
timing, all that. Make sure you fit your venue. We've said it over and over and over again,

1084
01:02:01,459 --> 01:02:03,161
the venue is going to be the most important thing.

1085
01:02:03,847 --> 01:02:06,068
Right on. Well, and for closing, I want to encourage we'll put

1086
01:02:06,108 --> 01:02:08,288
our email addresses up how to contact us in the chapter for

1087
01:02:08,368 --> 01:02:11,049
IGDA. If you have questions about it, we'd love to discuss

1088
01:02:11,069 --> 01:02:13,609
them with you. If you have tips, opportunities, better ways to

1089
01:02:13,649 --> 01:02:16,130
fund things, better kind of things to look for. We are as

1090
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:17,670
much as anything, not just trying to say this is how it's

1091
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:19,850
done. We're trying to create that conversation and learn from

1092
01:02:19,890 --> 01:02:22,051
you as well and your experiences. It would really

1093
01:02:22,091 --> 01:02:24,071
benefit us as we are continuing to try to run career fairs as

1094
01:02:24,111 --> 01:02:26,492
well. I thank you for taking the time to join us today. And

1095
01:02:27,012 --> 01:02:29,712
also thank you, of course, David, Drew and Tiffany. I'm

1096
01:02:29,792 --> 01:02:31,573
Chris. Thank you everyone for being here.

1097
01:02:31,973 --> 01:02:32,553
Thank you.

1098
01:02:33,676 --> 01:02:34,279
Bye everyone.

1099
01:02:34,801 --> 01:02:35,223
Bye.
