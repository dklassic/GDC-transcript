1
00:00:05,722 --> 00:00:09,345
Well, my talk is the holy grail of multiplayer level design.

2
00:00:09,345 --> 00:00:12,528
It's levels for competitive and casual play.

3
00:00:12,528 --> 00:00:16,011
Briefly about me, my background comes from the Unreal

4
00:00:16,011 --> 00:00:18,754
Tournament mod scene, especially Unreal Tournament 3,

5
00:00:18,754 --> 00:00:21,396
where there was the kind of hardcore, old school,

6
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,739
low poly map pack.

7
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:26,361
And also, I am a level designer at Hi-Rez Studios,

8
00:00:26,361 --> 00:00:29,084
where I do multiplayer level design, mostly on Paladins,

9
00:00:29,084 --> 00:00:31,546
but a little bit on Spite and some other stuff.

10
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,978
So before I get too far into the talk,

11
00:00:34,978 --> 00:00:37,281
some definitions, because I realize competitive

12
00:00:37,281 --> 00:00:39,764
and casual are kind of loaded terms

13
00:00:39,764 --> 00:00:43,308
when they're used in like blog circles.

14
00:00:43,308 --> 00:00:45,291
And by competitive, I'm really talking about eSports,

15
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:47,233
I'm talking about tournament play.

16
00:00:47,233 --> 00:00:49,336
And by casual, I'm basically talking about everything else.

17
00:00:49,336 --> 00:00:50,878
I'm talking about recreation play.

18
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:54,341
But these definitions do get a little bit fuzzy

19
00:00:54,341 --> 00:00:56,503
because I'm also talking about the motivations

20
00:00:56,503 --> 00:00:59,225
of competitive play and the motivations of casual play.

21
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:02,608
So like you could be a very skilled e-sports professional

22
00:01:02,608 --> 00:01:05,190
and choose to play, to goof around with friends,

23
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,432
to explore, to have many of the different

24
00:01:07,432 --> 00:01:08,893
sort of casual motivations for play.

25
00:01:08,893 --> 00:01:10,955
And likewise, you could be a new player

26
00:01:10,955 --> 00:01:14,418
who's still learning the game and are playing to win

27
00:01:14,418 --> 00:01:17,280
and playing to improve in a sort of competitive mindset.

28
00:01:18,571 --> 00:01:20,053
And when I'm talking about the Holy Grail,

29
00:01:20,053 --> 00:01:21,736
I'm talking about maps that really serve

30
00:01:21,736 --> 00:01:24,219
both of these audiences, serve this huge range.

31
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:27,625
So with that in mind, we all wanna make

32
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,507
kind of the greatest multiplayer maps, right?

33
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:32,271
So what are the greatest multiplayer maps of all time?

34
00:01:33,623 --> 00:01:37,185
And for some of you, what may come to mind is Facing Worlds

35
00:01:37,185 --> 00:01:38,746
from Unreal Tournament 99.

36
00:01:38,746 --> 00:01:42,047
This is a map that, for those who haven't played it,

37
00:01:42,047 --> 00:01:44,609
it's capture the flag, it's these two bases out in space

38
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:47,310
on this asteroid, and you're frantically going across

39
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,132
this sort of narrow pathways, and there are sniper shots

40
00:01:51,132 --> 00:01:54,253
going either way, and there's camera-guided rockets,

41
00:01:54,253 --> 00:01:55,874
and it's just ridiculous and frantic.

42
00:01:56,608 --> 00:02:03,274
Some of you may have thought of DM17 or Longest Yard from Quake 3 Arena. This map also happens to be in space.

43
00:02:03,274 --> 00:02:09,779
It's very open, it has jump pads, it has portals, and it's also kind of dominated by the hitscan railgun,

44
00:02:09,779 --> 00:02:14,803
which means that the only way to avoid that is using these movement mechanics on the map, and it's very fast.

45
00:02:14,803 --> 00:02:19,567
Some of you may have thought of Blood Gulch from Halo.

46
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,143
I guess it's kind of in space,

47
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:24,505
but it's more of an organic landscape

48
00:02:24,505 --> 00:02:28,489
and it's one of two maps in the original Halo multiplayer

49
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:31,011
that had vehicles in it, or for multiplayer at least.

50
00:02:31,011 --> 00:02:34,975
So some properties of these greatest of all time maps.

51
00:02:34,975 --> 00:02:38,298
One is that they have these big open environments

52
00:02:38,298 --> 00:02:40,159
that makes them pretty easy to learn,

53
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:41,581
pretty easy to navigate.

54
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:44,109
They also have pretty iconic themes,

55
00:02:44,109 --> 00:02:45,510
or really recognizable themes.

56
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,150
There are bases, there are sides to it,

57
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,251
or it's in space.

58
00:02:50,251 --> 00:02:52,451
And they also generally offer sandboxes of play.

59
00:02:52,451 --> 00:02:54,752
These maps have different mechanics

60
00:02:54,752 --> 00:02:57,333
that you don't get from other maps,

61
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:00,033
like with Facing Worlds you have the Redeemer rocket,

62
00:03:00,033 --> 00:03:02,454
and with the Halo map you have the vehicles.

63
00:03:02,454 --> 00:03:04,734
But I also mean sandbox of play

64
00:03:04,734 --> 00:03:06,775
as these maps are really good foundations

65
00:03:06,775 --> 00:03:08,575
for custom games and for mods.

66
00:03:08,575 --> 00:03:10,056
Like probably if you played Facing Worlds

67
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,216
you did slow-mo with...

68
00:03:12,029 --> 00:03:15,993
really dumb AI and insta-gib rifles and all sorts of nonsense.

69
00:03:15,993 --> 00:03:22,638
These maps also kind of create their conflict through their simplicity. These are maps that

70
00:03:22,638 --> 00:03:25,681
on facing worlds, if you're running to the other side and another player is running to

71
00:03:25,681 --> 00:03:29,644
get to your side, you're going to run into each other. It's a pretty simple map.

72
00:03:29,644 --> 00:03:35,369
But somehow through all these properties, these maps aren't really played competitively.

73
00:03:35,369 --> 00:03:39,173
Like they are played at LANs, but they aren't played in tournaments. They aren't played for cash money.

74
00:03:39,907 --> 00:03:43,374
So what maps are their sort of competitive counterparts?

75
00:03:45,046 --> 00:03:47,508
For Unreal Tournament, it's maps like DM Malevolence.

76
00:03:47,508 --> 00:03:50,530
This is a sort of dense interior space

77
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,151
with sort of three arena format

78
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:54,133
where each of these arenas has power weapons

79
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,295
and power items that you want to control.

80
00:03:56,295 --> 00:03:58,456
And really, it's a lot more complex

81
00:03:58,456 --> 00:04:01,198
and there's a lot more strategy to moving around this map.

82
00:04:01,198 --> 00:04:03,660
For Quake, it's maps like Lost World

83
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,262
or Arrow Walk or Blood Run.

84
00:04:05,262 --> 00:04:08,064
These maps also have that kind of dense interconnectivity

85
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:11,626
and these a lot more complicated pathing.

86
00:04:13,025 --> 00:04:15,966
For Halo, it was maps like Chill Out and Damnation,

87
00:04:15,966 --> 00:04:18,668
which are also this kind of three arena structure,

88
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:19,748
very dense.

89
00:04:19,748 --> 00:04:22,130
This one has portals, which is a main source

90
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,871
of its complexity, and about controlling items.

91
00:04:24,871 --> 00:04:27,233
So if you think of these properties again,

92
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:31,115
they're complex, the themes kind of stay out of the way

93
00:04:31,115 --> 00:04:33,816
and can even be disorienting with their simplicity.

94
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:35,457
And it's a focus on core mechanics.

95
00:04:35,457 --> 00:04:37,018
You don't see the nuclear rockets,

96
00:04:37,018 --> 00:04:38,599
you don't see vehicles on these maps.

97
00:04:39,535 --> 00:04:41,897
And instead of the conflict through simplicity,

98
00:04:41,897 --> 00:04:42,938
it's about item control.

99
00:04:42,938 --> 00:04:44,819
It's about moving around the map for power weapons.

100
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:46,861
And that means if you're playing these maps

101
00:04:46,861 --> 00:04:49,082
for the first time in sort of a one-v-one

102
00:04:49,082 --> 00:04:50,523
with another new player,

103
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,405
you might run circles and never see each other.

104
00:04:52,405 --> 00:04:56,247
And as a result, some of these maps aren't played casually,

105
00:04:56,247 --> 00:04:57,428
or they aren't the maps you play

106
00:04:57,428 --> 00:04:59,170
when you're first learning these games.

107
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,452
So what's going on here?

108
00:05:02,452 --> 00:05:04,073
Because none of these maps are bad.

109
00:05:04,073 --> 00:05:06,715
And in fact, all these maps are awesome at what they do.

110
00:05:07,437 --> 00:05:10,780
One way of thinking about this is kind of an overlap of audiences.

111
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:16,284
And this model here is from David Serlin in 2009, talking about fighting games,

112
00:05:16,284 --> 00:05:18,785
where he argued that for a fighting game to be successful,

113
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:21,748
you need to have that strong, hardcore, competitive scene

114
00:05:21,748 --> 00:05:23,489
and really cater the design around that.

115
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:27,172
And then the casual audience will kind of follow and congeal around that.

116
00:05:27,717 --> 00:05:29,777
And if you fail to serve that competitive audience,

117
00:05:29,777 --> 00:05:31,858
then the whole thing kind of dissipates,

118
00:05:31,858 --> 00:05:34,438
and it won't be a very long-lived game.

119
00:05:34,438 --> 00:05:36,799
We also see this with MOBAs, where

120
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:38,519
by really serving that competitive audience

121
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:41,340
and creating kind of the virtuous cycle of e-sports

122
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,741
viewership, ranked gameplay, we can get players engaged

123
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:46,581
and retained for a really long time.

124
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:49,422
But this isn't something that's true of all games.

125
00:05:49,422 --> 00:05:52,342
Like if we think of platformers, if we think of speed running

126
00:05:52,342 --> 00:05:55,343
as kind of the hardcore competitive equivalent,

127
00:05:57,033 --> 00:05:58,194
That's kind of an outlier, right?

128
00:05:58,194 --> 00:06:00,116
Like that's not the more extreme version.

129
00:06:00,116 --> 00:06:02,138
It's almost a completely separate game.

130
00:06:02,138 --> 00:06:04,621
And if we as designers are trying to create a game

131
00:06:04,621 --> 00:06:06,923
that really serves the maximum of these audiences,

132
00:06:06,923 --> 00:06:08,485
and we do that with platformers,

133
00:06:08,485 --> 00:06:10,767
we're gonna end up in this really weird niche

134
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:11,988
that doesn't really serve anybody.

135
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,781
So that's something to keep in mind.

136
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:17,261
Also this isn't just first person shooters,

137
00:06:17,261 --> 00:06:19,142
although that's what all my examples are from.

138
00:06:19,142 --> 00:06:23,402
We see this with action RPGs, we see this with MMOs

139
00:06:23,402 --> 00:06:25,763
where there's a difference between the hardcore players

140
00:06:25,763 --> 00:06:28,543
and with new players.

141
00:06:28,543 --> 00:06:31,504
We also see it in the real world with, for example,

142
00:06:31,504 --> 00:06:32,624
this is from paintballs.

143
00:06:32,624 --> 00:06:36,505
The example on the right here is a speedball

144
00:06:36,505 --> 00:06:38,945
variant of paintball where you have two teams of five

145
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:40,906
and each player fills a role.

146
00:06:40,906 --> 00:06:41,366
And it's very...

147
00:06:42,826 --> 00:06:43,767
very competitive structure.

148
00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:45,870
It's symmetrical and it's balanced.

149
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,472
You're playing to win.

150
00:06:47,472 --> 00:06:48,753
And on the left is scenario paintball,

151
00:06:48,753 --> 00:06:51,337
where these players are reenacting historical battle.

152
00:06:51,337 --> 00:06:53,760
And because it's a historical battle,

153
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,882
you know who's going to win and who's going to lose, right?

154
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,524
Like these players aren't playing to win.

155
00:06:57,524 --> 00:06:59,947
They're playing for very different motivations.

156
00:07:01,394 --> 00:07:03,555
Another way of thinking about this,

157
00:07:03,555 --> 00:07:06,657
that's kind of the way that casual and competitive

158
00:07:06,657 --> 00:07:08,338
and casual and hardcore gets thrown around

159
00:07:08,338 --> 00:07:10,559
is often in terms of, oh, those filthy casuals,

160
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:11,399
those low-skill players.

161
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:15,061
And it's actually a lot more complex than that

162
00:07:15,061 --> 00:07:17,523
because, at least for first-person shooters

163
00:07:17,523 --> 00:07:19,103
and with most games, there are these.

164
00:07:19,303 --> 00:07:21,384
kind of games within a game, and it's layers of skills

165
00:07:21,384 --> 00:07:22,985
that players are developing.

166
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:25,245
And for us, it's the first layer is mechanics,

167
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:27,086
where it's just moving and shooting

168
00:07:27,086 --> 00:07:29,247
and being able to navigate a 3D space

169
00:07:29,247 --> 00:07:31,648
and being able to even use a controller and a mouse.

170
00:07:31,648 --> 00:07:34,108
And that's tens or even hundreds of hours of gameplay

171
00:07:34,108 --> 00:07:37,529
there that sometimes we undersell as designers.

172
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:40,050
And once you have basic competence in that, which again,

173
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,351
is maybe tens of hours.

174
00:07:42,012 --> 00:07:43,653
Then you can start learning map specific

175
00:07:43,653 --> 00:07:45,755
and game specific knowledge and tactics

176
00:07:45,755 --> 00:07:48,457
and how to use items and how to move around the map

177
00:07:48,457 --> 00:07:49,998
and what angles you need to control.

178
00:07:49,998 --> 00:07:52,140
And then from there, once you have competence,

179
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,622
and again, that's another huge arc of mastery,

180
00:07:54,622 --> 00:07:56,023
then you can start worrying about

181
00:07:56,023 --> 00:07:57,444
sort of tournament level strategy,

182
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:59,185
which is the meta game, character picks,

183
00:07:59,185 --> 00:08:01,026
bands, maps, that sort of stuff.

184
00:08:01,487 --> 00:08:03,128
And all while doing this, you're developing

185
00:08:03,128 --> 00:08:05,351
some parallel skills that are your ability

186
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:07,032
to communicate with your other players,

187
00:08:07,032 --> 00:08:08,954
your ability to handle the psychological pressure

188
00:08:08,954 --> 00:08:12,638
of competition, your ability to not tilt in competition.

189
00:08:12,638 --> 00:08:15,801
But the key thing here is that as designers,

190
00:08:15,801 --> 00:08:17,102
sometimes we have a bias towards

191
00:08:17,102 --> 00:08:19,805
sort of the tactical strategy side of things,

192
00:08:19,805 --> 00:08:23,268
and there's a huge amount of gameplay we can serve

193
00:08:23,268 --> 00:08:24,870
just by focusing on mechanics.

194
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,788
Another way of thinking about this briefly

195
00:08:27,788 --> 00:08:29,548
is in terms of psychological models

196
00:08:29,548 --> 00:08:30,469
and traditional psychology.

197
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:33,389
The one that I found most useful for thinking about this

198
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:34,989
is self-determination theory,

199
00:08:34,989 --> 00:08:37,750
which basically argues that there are,

200
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,290
you can categorize intrinsic human satisfaction

201
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,971
into competence, autonomy, and relatedness,

202
00:08:42,971 --> 00:08:45,992
which in game design terms is kind of like thinking

203
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,132
mastery, choice, and teamwork.

204
00:08:48,132 --> 00:08:49,612
You can also think of relatedness

205
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,433
as kind of relative competence or relative autonomy.

206
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:58,796
And the important thing here is that this doesn't line up one to one with some idea of casual and

207
00:08:58,796 --> 00:09:05,523
competitive and that's kind of deflating the more mainstream filthy casual use of casual.

208
00:09:06,498 --> 00:09:08,819
But still taking all those different ways

209
00:09:08,819 --> 00:09:09,899
of viewing this problem in mind,

210
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:12,760
what are some ways that we can support casual play?

211
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,701
One is with sort of rebound and chaos mechanics.

212
00:09:15,701 --> 00:09:17,822
So the Blue Shell and Mario Kart

213
00:09:17,822 --> 00:09:19,323
is a really good example of this

214
00:09:19,323 --> 00:09:21,664
because it's an opportunity for a new

215
00:09:21,664 --> 00:09:24,104
or lower skilled player to catch up

216
00:09:24,104 --> 00:09:26,525
and subvert the experience of a better

217
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:28,266
or more experienced player.

218
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:29,246
But with first person shooters,

219
00:09:29,246 --> 00:09:31,367
we can also do this with random weapon starts,

220
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:33,828
random weapon timing, objectives that are random.

221
00:09:35,648 --> 00:09:38,070
We also wanna make sure that the maps are easy to learn.

222
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,571
So this example here is kind of a rough,

223
00:09:40,571 --> 00:09:42,071
abstract diagram of Chill Out,

224
00:09:42,071 --> 00:09:43,292
which I brought up earlier.

225
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:46,613
And the green dashed lines are the portal routes.

226
00:09:46,613 --> 00:09:48,354
So even though it's a very simple layout

227
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,755
that's not too hard to understand,

228
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,916
those portal routes make it very confusing

229
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,797
for new players and can be very disorienting.

230
00:09:54,869 --> 00:09:58,314
We also want to put a ceiling on tactics and strategy.

231
00:09:58,314 --> 00:10:01,199
And this is what Facing Worlds and DM17 do really well.

232
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:03,803
Through the simplicity of their layout,

233
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,846
there's not really room for tactical play,

234
00:10:05,846 --> 00:10:08,550
or at least not at the same degree

235
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,892
that we see in tournaments.

236
00:10:11,103 --> 00:10:12,224
But sort of in conflict with this,

237
00:10:12,224 --> 00:10:14,325
or something that we have to balance with this,

238
00:10:14,325 --> 00:10:16,106
is offering up a sandbox for players.

239
00:10:16,106 --> 00:10:19,089
Because not everybody's going to care about the same things.

240
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:20,950
Not everybody's going to learn the different mechanics

241
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,691
at the same pace.

242
00:10:22,691 --> 00:10:24,993
So Halo does a really good job of this with their vehicles,

243
00:10:24,993 --> 00:10:26,894
because some people like driving more

244
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:28,215
than they like running and gunning.

245
00:10:28,215 --> 00:10:30,277
And some people hate driving,

246
00:10:30,277 --> 00:10:32,058
and they don't have to use those tools

247
00:10:32,058 --> 00:10:32,759
if they don't want to.

248
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:36,281
It's a really good way of exploring different play styles.

249
00:10:36,281 --> 00:10:37,942
And it's something that the Battlefield games

250
00:10:37,942 --> 00:10:39,403
have done an excellent job of serving.

251
00:10:40,778 --> 00:10:44,980
On sort of the more technical level designing side of things, we want single scan arenas.

252
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:50,523
Basically what I mean by this is zero scan is kind of like walking into a closet that's

253
00:10:50,523 --> 00:10:54,465
small enough that your field of view encompasses everything and all the information is known

254
00:10:54,465 --> 00:10:56,046
as you walk through it.

255
00:10:56,046 --> 00:10:59,407
A single scan is a little bit like walking into a room where you have a blind spot on

256
00:10:59,407 --> 00:11:00,288
one side.

257
00:11:00,288 --> 00:11:04,150
And in order to see the whole room, you have to scan and...

258
00:11:05,052 --> 00:11:06,173
reveal that information.

259
00:11:06,173 --> 00:11:09,714
A multi-scan room, if you think of that sort of shaded

260
00:11:09,714 --> 00:11:12,476
square in the middle as a pillar, you have to keep moving

261
00:11:12,476 --> 00:11:14,717
and keep looking in order to maintain information.

262
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:16,698
So we want to keep things simple,

263
00:11:16,698 --> 00:11:17,838
we want to keep it single scan.

264
00:11:17,838 --> 00:11:20,640
That's basically how Facing Worlds and DM17

265
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,941
and Blood Gulch operate.

266
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,287
So some ways to support competitive play.

267
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,189
Kind of in contrast, we want multiple options.

268
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,291
We want complex options.

269
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,692
And even what I've drawn here is pretty simple.

270
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:34,495
But like the examples to the right of that are,

271
00:11:34,495 --> 00:11:39,921
they look a whole lot like facing worlds actually.

272
00:11:39,921 --> 00:11:41,763
And that doesn't generally lead to a lot of

273
00:11:41,763 --> 00:11:43,505
tactical variety for players

274
00:11:43,505 --> 00:11:45,747
and can turn the competitive game stale.

275
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:48,742
We also want to make sure these options are resilient.

276
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:51,964
And basically, when you get into some state,

277
00:11:51,964 --> 00:11:53,164
you can recover from it.

278
00:11:53,164 --> 00:11:55,985
And that means you don't want to be spawn camp

279
00:11:55,985 --> 00:11:56,886
for a whole match.

280
00:11:56,886 --> 00:11:58,206
But it also means, like in MOBAs,

281
00:11:58,206 --> 00:12:00,247
you don't want to fall behind on the farm

282
00:12:00,247 --> 00:12:02,068
and never be able to recover.

283
00:12:02,068 --> 00:12:04,929
And this is really with e-sports in mind,

284
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:06,310
because we want dramatic games.

285
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,670
We want stories.

286
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:12,392
And one mistake early on is, if that means the whole game,

287
00:12:12,392 --> 00:12:13,833
that's not very exciting to watch.

288
00:12:15,185 --> 00:12:16,626
We also want those multi-scan arenas.

289
00:12:16,626 --> 00:12:19,067
Again, this is kind of the foundation

290
00:12:19,067 --> 00:12:20,368
for a lot of that tactical play.

291
00:12:20,368 --> 00:12:24,050
If multiplayer maps were just the single scan arenas

292
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,711
and were all very simple spaces,

293
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:28,253
then it would just be about who has the better

294
00:12:28,253 --> 00:12:30,954
mechanical aim, who can hit their target most reliably.

295
00:12:30,954 --> 00:12:36,197
So, what about the Holy Grail maps?

296
00:12:36,197 --> 00:12:39,639
What about these maps that do both of these things?

297
00:12:41,263 --> 00:12:42,783
You probably noticed that there are a couple of maps

298
00:12:42,783 --> 00:12:45,304
that I haven't mentioned, and maybe to some of you

299
00:12:45,304 --> 00:12:47,325
that seems really weird.

300
00:12:47,325 --> 00:12:51,946
So Dust 2, for example, is a map that,

301
00:12:51,946 --> 00:12:56,588
yep, Dust 2 is a map that does both of these things

302
00:12:56,588 --> 00:12:59,509
very well and serves both a competitive

303
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:00,989
and casual audience, and that's partly because

304
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:03,130
it has just the right amount of complexity

305
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,171
that you can form different tactical options,

306
00:13:05,171 --> 00:13:07,191
but it's also very clean geometry.

307
00:13:07,191 --> 00:13:08,412
It's 90 degree angles.

308
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,252
It's very open, clean spaces.

309
00:13:11,193 --> 00:13:12,734
There are a couple curves in the map,

310
00:13:12,734 --> 00:13:14,876
but for the most part it's on 90 degree angles.

311
00:13:14,876 --> 00:13:18,118
For Halo there are maps like Lockout,

312
00:13:18,118 --> 00:13:21,201
which it's a very dense space, it's multi-tiered space,

313
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:22,822
there's a lot of verticality to it,

314
00:13:22,822 --> 00:13:25,144
but it's also these kind of additive structures

315
00:13:25,144 --> 00:13:28,707
floating in space that are connected by bridges,

316
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,308
which makes it much easier to understand

317
00:13:30,308 --> 00:13:32,410
where you are relative to other structures,

318
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,431
and very easy to navigate.

319
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:36,193
It also has the added bonus of exploding barrels,

320
00:13:36,193 --> 00:13:38,155
and like this jump pad elevator thing,

321
00:13:38,155 --> 00:13:38,915
so like.

322
00:13:39,563 --> 00:13:42,128
How can you not have fun with that?

323
00:13:42,128 --> 00:13:45,395
For Quake, it's maps like Campground,

324
00:13:45,395 --> 00:13:47,199
and there are a couple others,

325
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,722
but Campgrounds is the one that.

326
00:13:49,617 --> 00:13:51,800
really fits this the best.

327
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,963
And it still follows sort of the competitive format

328
00:13:54,963 --> 00:13:57,346
where it's this three arena structure

329
00:13:57,346 --> 00:13:58,987
and these hallways interconnecting them

330
00:13:58,987 --> 00:14:01,911
in sort of dense ways, but doesn't rely on portals,

331
00:14:01,911 --> 00:14:04,894
it's not overly vertical, which makes it pretty easy

332
00:14:04,894 --> 00:14:06,996
to understand each of these spaces and how they connect

333
00:14:06,996 --> 00:14:09,639
and lets you navigate the level pretty quickly.

334
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:11,781
It's not hard for a new player to pick that map up.

335
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:15,344
So some properties, there's kind of an intermediate

336
00:14:15,344 --> 00:14:16,304
complexity to these maps.

337
00:14:16,304 --> 00:14:19,105
They're readability focused environment art,

338
00:14:19,105 --> 00:14:22,066
they aren't really aiming for some really strong thematic.

339
00:14:22,066 --> 00:14:26,407
But aside from that, it's kind of like,

340
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,428
there's not a lot of overlap.

341
00:14:28,428 --> 00:14:30,829
These maps are all kind of specific solutions

342
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:32,349
to each of their game's designs.

343
00:14:32,349 --> 00:14:35,130
We can't take Dust 2 and put it in...

344
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:38,339
and halo and expect it to work.

345
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:41,340
We can't put lockout and counter strike

346
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,021
and expect that to work.

347
00:14:42,021 --> 00:14:44,022
These maps are specific solutions,

348
00:14:44,022 --> 00:14:46,763
which is, if we're trying to make maps like this,

349
00:14:46,763 --> 00:14:48,624
then what can we take from this?

350
00:14:48,624 --> 00:14:50,425
And also, some of you are probably wondering

351
00:14:50,425 --> 00:14:52,146
why I call them holy grails.

352
00:14:52,146 --> 00:14:53,807
To my knowledge, this is just kind of the term

353
00:14:53,807 --> 00:14:55,188
I personally use for it.

354
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,611
And part of it is this idea that the Holy Grail grants

355
00:14:58,611 --> 00:15:02,734
eternal youth, that it's, in terms of multiplayer games,

356
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:05,075
you don't need a lot of these really good maps

357
00:15:05,075 --> 00:15:06,156
in order to keep your game alive.

358
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:07,597
Like there are still 24-7 Dust 2 servers.

359
00:15:07,597 --> 00:15:08,878
That's incredible.

360
00:15:08,878 --> 00:15:13,561
And, you know, especially with increased fidelity

361
00:15:13,561 --> 00:15:15,962
expectations and the cost of delivering that fidelity,

362
00:15:15,962 --> 00:15:18,924
being able to create a couple of really good maps

363
00:15:18,924 --> 00:15:22,946
rather than 50 okay maps or 50 specific audience maps,

364
00:15:22,946 --> 00:15:23,847
that's...

365
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:26,380
really good if you can do that.

366
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,002
But I also call them this

367
00:15:28,002 --> 00:15:30,023
because the holy grail isn't real.

368
00:15:30,023 --> 00:15:33,846
And like my example with platforming and speed running,

369
00:15:33,846 --> 00:15:37,669
you may end up kind of serving a niche

370
00:15:37,669 --> 00:15:39,070
or running into some problems with that.

371
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,471
So another way of thinking of that

372
00:15:40,471 --> 00:15:43,593
is kind of the ultimate vanilla.

373
00:15:43,593 --> 00:15:47,936
Basically it's a flavor that doesn't offend anybody.

374
00:15:48,669 --> 00:15:51,952
And everybody can bring their own personal flavors

375
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:53,714
to vanilla and it still works with vanilla.

376
00:15:53,714 --> 00:15:55,916
You can have peanut butter vanilla,

377
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:59,699
you can have sour gummy vanilla and it still, yeah.

378
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:03,202
So, some cautions around pursuing a Holy Grail map.

379
00:16:03,202 --> 00:16:05,444
So now I'm gonna talk about paladins

380
00:16:05,444 --> 00:16:07,346
and sort of my quest for a Holy Grail map.

381
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:09,348
So this is Paladins.

382
00:16:09,348 --> 00:16:11,470
We are a team-based first-person shooter.

383
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,832
We have two teams of five.

384
00:16:13,832 --> 00:16:16,754
Each player is choosing a unique champion

385
00:16:16,754 --> 00:16:18,436
with their own abilities.

386
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:22,939
And each character also has a whole bunch of customization

387
00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:25,341
that happens in this kind of out-of-match loop.

388
00:16:25,341 --> 00:16:27,023
We also have objectives.

389
00:16:27,023 --> 00:16:28,424
There are capture points, and there are payloads

390
00:16:28,424 --> 00:16:29,025
you're pushing.

391
00:16:29,025 --> 00:16:31,367
And we're also following the sort of free-to-play

392
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:32,447
games-as-a-service model.

393
00:16:32,447 --> 00:16:35,350
So we're constantly trying to update and make it better.

394
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,431
And it's not like we've.

395
00:16:36,651 --> 00:16:39,212
shipped it and we're done and we'll do better next time.

396
00:16:39,212 --> 00:16:41,013
It's like no, we're still trying to find ways

397
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:42,653
to make it as good as we can.

398
00:16:42,653 --> 00:16:46,435
So some history, just for context for what I'm going to cover.

399
00:16:46,435 --> 00:16:50,116
Paladins really started as more of a MOBA

400
00:16:50,116 --> 00:16:51,737
with a first person perspective,

401
00:16:51,737 --> 00:16:54,418
and then moved into more of the class-based

402
00:16:54,418 --> 00:16:55,698
first person shooter it is now.

403
00:16:55,698 --> 00:17:00,280
And part of that is there were a lot of perception problems

404
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,121
when the game went to closed beta

405
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,422
as this kind of MOBA with first person perspective

406
00:17:04,422 --> 00:17:04,722
where.

407
00:17:06,835 --> 00:17:07,304
There is...

408
00:17:08,785 --> 00:17:11,267
just genre conventions around first person shooters

409
00:17:11,267 --> 00:17:12,267
that weren't quite being met.

410
00:17:12,267 --> 00:17:15,049
And part of that is that we moved from a high time to kill

411
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:16,149
to a medium time to kill.

412
00:17:16,149 --> 00:17:19,151
We basically had a time to kill around 15 seconds,

413
00:17:19,151 --> 00:17:21,972
which is insane, and moved to somewhere

414
00:17:21,972 --> 00:17:25,034
between like three and 10, depending on what characters.

415
00:17:25,034 --> 00:17:27,475
I forgot to mention, but we also have classes.

416
00:17:27,475 --> 00:17:29,436
We have like healers and tanks and DPS

417
00:17:29,436 --> 00:17:31,077
and flanking characters.

418
00:17:31,077 --> 00:17:34,198
So like the 10 seconds is like two tanks brawling

419
00:17:34,198 --> 00:17:37,080
versus the three seconds is two flanks having a duel.

420
00:17:38,459 --> 00:17:42,986
We also, through the process of closed beta, went from this sort of chaotic, unpredictable

421
00:17:42,986 --> 00:17:45,430
gameplay to something a lot more deterministic.

422
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:49,637
This was really in service of our competitive scene and there was a whole lot of what just

423
00:17:49,637 --> 00:17:52,341
happened to me moments in our playtesting that we were trying to resolve.

424
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,740
And basically with all these design changes,

425
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,701
for level design we were trying to

426
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,561
sort of keep up with the game design.

427
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:03,083
And I meant going from these sprawling MOBA inspired maps

428
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,804
to a lot more traditional, tight, FPS style maps.

429
00:18:05,804 --> 00:18:09,285
So basically we went from maps that look kinda like that,

430
00:18:09,285 --> 00:18:11,746
and this is from the summer of 2016,

431
00:18:11,746 --> 00:18:15,507
this is after we shrunk the map down multiple times.

432
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,075
And this is also a view of the map

433
00:18:18,075 --> 00:18:20,396
that's only showing about a third of it.

434
00:18:20,396 --> 00:18:21,897
And we went to maps like this,

435
00:18:21,897 --> 00:18:23,797
which is much more recognizable

436
00:18:23,797 --> 00:18:25,338
as a first-person shooter style level.

437
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:29,279
For perspective, that's about the size difference.

438
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,120
That's Enchanted Forest on the left.

439
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,500
That's kind of the old style map.

440
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,482
And again, that's after we shrunk it down multiple times.

441
00:18:37,482 --> 00:18:39,382
And that's our kind of current approach

442
00:18:39,382 --> 00:18:40,823
to level design on the right.

443
00:18:41,868 --> 00:18:46,773
So through this process of taking those mobile maps and shrinking them down and

444
00:18:46,773 --> 00:18:51,197
taking and making new maps in that style, we developed a set of principles.

445
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:52,778
One thing is that we want strategic variety.

446
00:18:52,778 --> 00:18:56,442
We want to make sure that every time you're going after an objective or

447
00:18:56,442 --> 00:18:59,585
doing any kind of play on the map, you have multiple options open to you.

448
00:19:00,286 --> 00:19:02,047
We also wanted to keep the maps pretty simple.

449
00:19:02,047 --> 00:19:06,090
And this is mostly speaking to our characters' abilities.

450
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:08,771
We have larger than life dodge rolls and AOEs

451
00:19:08,771 --> 00:19:09,672
that can fill the capture points.

452
00:19:09,672 --> 00:19:11,974
We want to make sure that players aren't tripping up

453
00:19:11,974 --> 00:19:14,495
over little bits of geometry that don't matter

454
00:19:14,495 --> 00:19:16,637
for our kind of gameplay.

455
00:19:16,637 --> 00:19:19,719
We also want to center on the core mechanics.

456
00:19:19,719 --> 00:19:21,300
We found with some of the maps that they ended up

457
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,901
being kind of sniper dominant,

458
00:19:22,901 --> 00:19:25,923
and our players didn't respond very well to that,

459
00:19:25,923 --> 00:19:28,525
or at least our competitive scene didn't.

460
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,202
So we kept it focused on that sort of healer tank DPS

461
00:19:32,202 --> 00:19:32,662
holy trinity.

462
00:19:32,662 --> 00:19:37,284
And we also want to limit zoning and allow recovery.

463
00:19:37,284 --> 00:19:39,305
This is going back to that idea of resilience

464
00:19:39,305 --> 00:19:41,526
and our sort of competitive principles.

465
00:19:42,233 --> 00:19:44,395
And specifically with these older maps,

466
00:19:44,395 --> 00:19:46,317
the most dangerous locations was the route

467
00:19:46,317 --> 00:19:47,939
to get to the objective.

468
00:19:47,939 --> 00:19:50,121
Because the way those maps were designed

469
00:19:50,121 --> 00:19:51,962
and just the constraints around that kind of design

470
00:19:51,962 --> 00:19:54,585
is that whoever won the first fight for an objective

471
00:19:54,585 --> 00:19:56,267
could then push forward and zone

472
00:19:56,267 --> 00:19:58,949
and prevent the other team from even being able to contest.

473
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:00,971
And that was the optimal strategy

474
00:20:00,971 --> 00:20:03,634
and you'd see it in competitive play

475
00:20:03,634 --> 00:20:04,895
and it was just, oh, it was rough.

476
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:07,160
Another principle that we have,

477
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,863
this is a little bit more on the environment art side,

478
00:20:08,863 --> 00:20:10,385
is that we wanna make sure that what you see

479
00:20:10,385 --> 00:20:10,966
is what you get.

480
00:20:10,966 --> 00:20:12,849
We have characters that can fly,

481
00:20:12,849 --> 00:20:15,273
and we wanna make sure that as you're going over rooftops,

482
00:20:15,273 --> 00:20:16,615
you aren't hitting invisible walls.

483
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,598
And that really defines a lot of

484
00:20:18,598 --> 00:20:20,441
kind of the level design problems we run into.

485
00:20:21,122 --> 00:20:24,023
If we rephrase this sort of thinking in terms of our

486
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:25,964
casual and competitive and holy grail divide,

487
00:20:25,964 --> 00:20:28,104
most of these things were in service

488
00:20:28,104 --> 00:20:30,245
of our competitive players.

489
00:20:30,245 --> 00:20:32,406
Like even the idea of simplicity,

490
00:20:32,406 --> 00:20:33,946
sure that helps casual players,

491
00:20:33,946 --> 00:20:36,307
that helps that motivation,

492
00:20:36,307 --> 00:20:39,588
but a lot of it is still like just the nature of the game.

493
00:20:39,588 --> 00:20:41,949
So some results of these iterations.

494
00:20:42,903 --> 00:20:44,884
As a team of level designers, we felt a lot better

495
00:20:44,884 --> 00:20:45,684
about our maps.

496
00:20:45,684 --> 00:20:48,386
They were a lot easier to make, they were more fun to make,

497
00:20:48,386 --> 00:20:50,507
and they were a lot more fun to playtest.

498
00:20:50,507 --> 00:20:52,248
And our metrics were up, we had better retention

499
00:20:52,248 --> 00:20:55,570
and engagement from our closed beta feedback.

500
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,892
And we had a much healthier competitive scene

501
00:20:57,892 --> 00:20:59,553
where it was actually engaging and exciting

502
00:20:59,553 --> 00:21:00,993
to watch our players compete

503
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,855
because there were multiple strategies available to them

504
00:21:03,855 --> 00:21:04,636
and it was exciting.

505
00:21:05,456 --> 00:21:07,437
But in terms of subjective, sort of anecdotal player

506
00:21:07,437 --> 00:21:09,958
feedback, it was a little bit more lukewarm

507
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:10,738
than we had hoped.

508
00:21:10,738 --> 00:21:13,159
So basically what we thought we did was something like this.

509
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:16,261
We thought we had that kind of MOBA or fighting game

510
00:21:16,261 --> 00:21:18,742
situation where if we served our competitive audience,

511
00:21:18,742 --> 00:21:19,262
we'd be set.

512
00:21:19,262 --> 00:21:22,303
And we could just keep making the best competitive maps

513
00:21:22,303 --> 00:21:24,924
we could and we'd just keep doing that forever

514
00:21:24,924 --> 00:21:27,005
and the game would be awesome.

515
00:21:27,005 --> 00:21:29,406
But I think what we actually realized we have

516
00:21:29,406 --> 00:21:31,107
is a bit more like this where our competitive scene

517
00:21:31,107 --> 00:21:32,628
is kind of an outlier to what

518
00:21:33,088 --> 00:21:36,213
a lot of the more casual audience wants from the game.

519
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:38,997
And with our change to these maps,

520
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:41,180
we ended up missing the mark a little bit

521
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,343
and losing some of that audience.

522
00:21:44,529 --> 00:21:46,670
Or at least we still have players on our forum saying,

523
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,370
I kind of want those old maps back.

524
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:51,691
Which to us as designers is like, oh no.

525
00:21:51,691 --> 00:21:56,252
So what some of those players want is really more variety.

526
00:21:56,252 --> 00:21:57,992
They want bigger maps, they want asymmetry,

527
00:21:57,992 --> 00:21:59,293
which is another way of getting variety,

528
00:21:59,293 --> 00:22:00,773
and they want the stronger themes.

529
00:22:00,773 --> 00:22:02,313
One of the best things about those old maps

530
00:22:02,313 --> 00:22:04,554
is that you're besieging an enemy fortress

531
00:22:04,554 --> 00:22:06,434
with a big siege engine thing,

532
00:22:06,434 --> 00:22:09,275
and it's like the theme of it is really rich,

533
00:22:09,275 --> 00:22:11,456
and that's something that we've kind of moved away from.

534
00:22:12,436 --> 00:22:18,818
So a way for us to try and understand basically this casual competitive divide better is with

535
00:22:18,818 --> 00:22:24,521
public test queue. This was a queue that we set up for this last year. We only recently shut

536
00:22:24,521 --> 00:22:29,863
it off, but it was running for basically a whole year of public gray box maps. And if you're a

537
00:22:29,863 --> 00:22:33,224
player who was at level 14, I think it was,

538
00:22:33,804 --> 00:22:35,727
You could play test these maps and after each match

539
00:22:35,727 --> 00:22:37,369
you'd get a feedback form saying,

540
00:22:37,369 --> 00:22:38,751
what'd you think of the map?

541
00:22:38,751 --> 00:22:40,814
And sometimes we had other specific questions

542
00:22:40,814 --> 00:22:41,595
we were asking as well.

543
00:22:41,595 --> 00:22:43,537
But the main idea is that we wanted to

544
00:22:43,537 --> 00:22:44,879
better understand our audience,

545
00:22:44,879 --> 00:22:47,643
better understand kind of that Venn diagram.

546
00:22:47,643 --> 00:22:49,465
And we also wanted to test specific experiments,

547
00:22:49,465 --> 00:22:50,507
which I'll go over in a minute.

548
00:22:51,118 --> 00:22:52,759
We also wanted to reduce the risk of creating

549
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:55,741
sort of lukewarm maps or these sort of false grails.

550
00:22:55,741 --> 00:23:00,003
So this is Sand Bridge, this is a test queue map obviously.

551
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:03,886
This is a map which I designed specifically

552
00:23:03,886 --> 00:23:05,887
to challenge some of the design principles

553
00:23:05,887 --> 00:23:08,309
that we had set up over this course of iteration.

554
00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:10,530
I created these really elaborate flank routes

555
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,551
and these really dominant sniper towers

556
00:23:12,551 --> 00:23:14,392
and there are portals in the map

557
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:16,213
and I thought players would hate it.

558
00:23:16,213 --> 00:23:16,454
But.

559
00:23:17,427 --> 00:23:19,329
It was actually one of our highest rated maps

560
00:23:19,329 --> 00:23:21,431
in the test queue at the time.

561
00:23:21,431 --> 00:23:23,433
But also we had competitive players coming to us

562
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:25,335
and saying this is why I don't play the test queue,

563
00:23:25,335 --> 00:23:26,657
this is terrible.

564
00:23:26,657 --> 00:23:28,659
And that just kind of highlighted this divide

565
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:30,801
that we'd started to realize.

566
00:23:30,801 --> 00:23:32,283
So the map I made after that in trying to,

567
00:23:32,283 --> 00:23:36,307
in trying to understand this better was Sewer,

568
00:23:36,307 --> 00:23:38,849
which, hint, hint, if you call your map Sewer,

569
00:23:39,948 --> 00:23:43,128
Yeah, so I designed this map specifically

570
00:23:43,128 --> 00:23:45,409
for healers and tanks, and I want to really

571
00:23:45,409 --> 00:23:50,830
boil it down into that calculus of just healer tank math

572
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:54,351
and really limit the options for flying characters.

573
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:56,151
This is kind of no-clipped into the wall,

574
00:23:56,151 --> 00:23:58,011
so it makes it look like it's open space,

575
00:23:58,011 --> 00:23:59,832
but it's actually all enclosed,

576
00:23:59,832 --> 00:24:00,952
so you can't really fly anywhere,

577
00:24:00,952 --> 00:24:02,792
you can't really flank that much,

578
00:24:02,792 --> 00:24:05,553
and yeah, on average players didn't like it so much.

579
00:24:06,661 --> 00:24:10,745
And this is Corey, this is after we went through

580
00:24:10,745 --> 00:24:12,266
the sort of gray box pass.

581
00:24:12,266 --> 00:24:16,270
This is the final art as we released it.

582
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,951
And with this one I wasn't really testing

583
00:24:17,951 --> 00:24:19,533
any specific experiments.

584
00:24:19,533 --> 00:24:21,515
I wasn't running any wild ideas.

585
00:24:21,515 --> 00:24:23,717
This was just me trying to make the best map I could

586
00:24:23,717 --> 00:24:25,819
and use the test queue as kind of a vetting process

587
00:24:25,819 --> 00:24:28,561
to make sure we weren't releasing a lukewarm map.

588
00:24:29,202 --> 00:24:31,044
And while it was popular in the test queue,

589
00:24:31,044 --> 00:24:32,846
once we actually released it with the final art,

590
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:36,429
we found that it was a little bit lukewarm.

591
00:24:36,429 --> 00:24:38,231
Like we did get some weird feedback

592
00:24:38,231 --> 00:24:39,032
that we hadn't expected.

593
00:24:39,032 --> 00:24:41,435
Players were confused and disoriented.

594
00:24:41,435 --> 00:24:43,096
They felt claustrophobic.

595
00:24:43,096 --> 00:24:46,340
And partly that's speaking to most players' inability

596
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,883
to evaluate gray box maps.

597
00:24:50,611 --> 00:24:52,853
it's also speaking to that divide in our audience

598
00:24:52,853 --> 00:24:54,935
and that we can't do competitive and casual both.

599
00:24:54,935 --> 00:24:58,057
So if that's the case, what's next?

600
00:24:58,057 --> 00:25:01,340
For us, with this realization that our casual

601
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,582
and competitive scenes don't totally overlap

602
00:25:03,582 --> 00:25:06,985
and we can't just make awesome competitive maps forever.

603
00:25:08,245 --> 00:25:09,806
We've created new game modes,

604
00:25:09,806 --> 00:25:11,447
and we have a team deathmatch mode,

605
00:25:11,447 --> 00:25:13,808
and we have sort of an onslaught,

606
00:25:13,808 --> 00:25:15,229
king of the hills style mode.

607
00:25:15,229 --> 00:25:18,411
And these are opportunities for us to create maps

608
00:25:18,411 --> 00:25:20,612
that are really in service to casual audiences.

609
00:25:20,612 --> 00:25:22,973
We can do a lot more map dynamics,

610
00:25:22,973 --> 00:25:23,953
we can have asymmetry,

611
00:25:23,953 --> 00:25:25,474
we can do all sorts of wild, crazy things,

612
00:25:25,474 --> 00:25:27,755
and our competitive players won't care

613
00:25:27,755 --> 00:25:29,116
because it's not for them.

614
00:25:29,116 --> 00:25:30,137
It's awesome.

615
00:25:31,482 --> 00:25:33,703
But, of course, we're still moving forward with that

616
00:25:33,703 --> 00:25:36,324
to try and figure out how to best answer that question.

617
00:25:36,324 --> 00:25:39,405
So, kind of the main takeaway from all of this,

618
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:42,347
through this process, the main thing that I learned

619
00:25:42,347 --> 00:25:43,827
was this kind of audience check.

620
00:25:43,827 --> 00:25:46,888
So, basically, every time I am designing something new,

621
00:25:46,888 --> 00:25:48,969
I ask myself this series of questions.

622
00:25:48,969 --> 00:25:51,650
Who all are we designing this for?

623
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:54,186
What are their needs?

624
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:56,929
And again, think back to the self-determination theory,

625
00:25:56,929 --> 00:25:58,910
competence, autonomy, relatedness,

626
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,812
what are we really offering up

627
00:26:00,812 --> 00:26:02,634
with this map or this game mode?

628
00:26:02,634 --> 00:26:04,676
And how does our design serve those needs?

629
00:26:04,676 --> 00:26:09,620
And because these questions are kind of hard to answer,

630
00:26:12,346 --> 00:26:14,548
there's kind of the follow-up question of

631
00:26:14,548 --> 00:26:16,269
what steps can we do to answer these questions?

632
00:26:16,269 --> 00:26:19,051
And that's really what we did with the test queue.

633
00:26:19,051 --> 00:26:22,073
So basically I want to rephrase the idea of

634
00:26:22,073 --> 00:26:24,555
us all wanting to create the greatest map of all time

635
00:26:24,555 --> 00:26:27,216
or a map that belongs in the ranks of facing worlds

636
00:26:27,216 --> 00:26:30,038
and instead think of it as designing maps

637
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:31,139
to serve our audience.

638
00:26:31,139 --> 00:26:32,520
That's my talk.
